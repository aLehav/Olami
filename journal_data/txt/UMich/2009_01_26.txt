Michigan junior defenseman Steve Kampfer lays motionless on the ice following an incident with two Michigan State players dufing Saturday night's men's ice hockey game.

After brutal hit
during the game,
incident follows in
visitor's locker room

Daily Sports Editors
About 30 minutes after the end
of the Wolverines' 5-3 win over
Michigan State Saturday night, a
somber hush fell upon the small
crowd gathered outside the Michi-
gan hockey locker room.
The lighthearted mood from the
players' postgame press conference
had dissipated. The enjoyment of
six straight victories over the Spar-

tans - the Wolverines' longest win
streak against them in 47 seasons -
momentarily ended.
Junior defenseman Steve Kamp-
fer, still in his maize game sweater
and with his neck in a brace, was
being carted out of Yost Ice Arena
on a gurney by paramedics. As team
officials cleared the hallway, a visit-
ing junior hockey team waiting to
greet the Wolverines looked on in
disbelief.
Kampfer, a Jackson, Mich. na-
tive, was punched from behind by
Spartan forward Andrew Conboy
and slashed in the head and neck
areas while laying motionless by
Michigan State forward Corey
Tropp in the final minute of Michi-
gan's victory. Michigan State coach
Rick Comley called the hit "cheap"
and "uncalled for" after the game.
And, according to a Department

of Public Safety report, once Tropp
was kicked out of the game, "a visi-
tor assaulted a hockey player after
being upset about an incident that
happened during the game."
DPS spokeswoman Diane Brown
said that the incident followed the
ejection from the game. She said
the player ejected from yesterday's
game - which, according to the box
score, was Tropp - was in the visi-
tor's locker room and a 48-year-old
man from Jackson confronted him.
"We had a parent come crashing
into the locker room and fight my
player," Comley said to the State
News.
According to multiple sources
close to the situation, the man was
taken to the Yost offices behind the
skate rental booth for DPS ques-
tioning.
"I heard him tell the officer that

he did grab Tropp by the jersey, and
they were also holding each other
and yelling at each other," said a
person who was in the room during
the questioning. The person asked
to remain anonymous because he
was not authorized to speak to the
press on the matter.
The hit on Kampfer was espe-
cially poignant, considering his
recent history of head injuries. He
suffered a fractured skull in an off-
ice incident on Oct.12, was ina neck
brace until Nov.19 and didn't return
to game action until Dec. 27.

University's MELAB
expands testing sites
in growing market
By CAITLIN SCHNEIDER
Daily StaffReporter
Asthenumberofforeignstudents
applying to U.S. colleges continues
to grow, the University's English
Language Institute is expanding its
testing sites for the Michigan Eng-
lish Language Assessment Battery.
The MELAB, which originated
at the University of Michigan, is a
test of English writing, speaking
and reading proficiency.
When the number of interna-
tional applicants is expected to hit
at an all time high in a year, the
University is concurrently bolster-
ing the availability of the MELAB
by adding new testing sites around
* the world.
The University has offered the
MELAB exam foryears,but it never
sought the scope of giants like the
Test of English as a Foreign Lan-
guage (TOEFL) or International

English Language Testing System
(IELTS).
Until now, the most well-known
test of English language ability has
been TOEFL. But, as the market for
such a test has grown, competitors
like the IELTS have emerged.
In an e-mail interview, Erica
Sanders, the director of recruit-
ment and operations in the Office
of Undergraduate Admissions said,
"The MELAB is accepted as a test
of English as a second language ex-
amination; not in place of TOEFL,
but as an alternative."
According to the English Lan-
guage Institute, that alternative is
one that droves of international
students are electing.
The MELAB is accepted at many
U.S. universities and while the test
has only been administered in the
United States and Canada in the
past, institutions in the United
Kingdom, Sweden and Norway now
recognize it.
In the industry of well-estab-
lished names, the MELAB dis-
tinguishes itself by remaining a
strictly paper-and-pencil test.

NEWS BRIEFS
NEW YORK
Gillibrand promises
common ground
Senator-designate Kirsten Gilli-
brand pledged yesterday to combat
gunviolencewhile protectinghunt-
ers' rights, saying "there's enor-
mous space for common ground"
on issues that she differs from fel-
low New York Democrats.
Gillibrand met yesterday with
Gov. David Paterson, senior Sen.
Charles Schumer and Secretary
of State Hillary Rodham Clinton,
whose vacant Senate seat Gillibrand
was appointed to fill Friday.
Marissa Shorenstein, a spokes-
woman for Paterson, said the gov-
ernor's office delivered paperwork
in Washington yesterday formaliz-
ing Gillibrand's appointment to the
Senate.
Gillibrand, a second-term con-
gresswoman who worked on the
former first lady's 2000 Senate
campaign, said Clinton "has always
been a mentor of mine and someone
I've always admired."
Paterson appointed Gillibrand
after the presumed front-runner,
Caroline Kennedy, withdrew from
contention over personal reasons.
JERUSALEM
Israel defends
soldiers against war
crime charges
Special legal teams will defend
Israeli soldiers against potential
war crimes charges stemming from
civilian deaths in the Gaza Strip,
the prime minister said yesterday,
promising the country would fully
back those who fought in the three-
week offensive.
The move reflected growing con-
cerns by Israel that officers could
be subject to international prosecu-
tion, despite the army's claims that
Hamas militants caused the civil-
ian casualties by staging attacks
from residential areas.
"The state of Israel will fully
back those who acted on its behalf,"
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said.
"The soldiers and commanders
who were sent on missions in Gaza
must know that they are safe from
various tribunals."
Speaking at the weekly Cabinet
meeting, Olmert said Israel's jus-
tice minister would lead a team of
senior officials to coordinate the
legal defense of anyone involved in
the offensive.
"That decision is not going to
prevent all these organizations and
countries to pursue their efforts
through legal means," Palestinian
Foreign Minister Riad Malki said
at talks with European Union for-
eign ministers in Brussels.

Blagojevich refuses
participation in
impeachment trial

If there's such a thing as a "nor-

that starts today in Illinois doesn't
qualify.
The defendant, Gov. Rod
Blagojevich, won't participate.
He'll be talking to Whoopi Gold-
berg and Larry King instead of
facing the state Senate. And while
the Democrat acknowledges his
conviction is certain, he refuses to
Presign.
Blagojevich (pronounced blah-
GOY'-uh-vich) complains that the
trial rules are unfair, but he and
his lawyers didn't try to influence
the rules as they were written or
afterward.
After weeks of near-silence,
Blagojevich has begun an ener-
getic public relations campaign,
comparing himself to the hero of a
Frank Capra movie and a cowboy
being lynched for a crime he didn't
commit.

Ayers to discuss
his anti-war past

President Barack Obama speaks to reporters during a meeting about the economy Friday with Congressional leaders,
including Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland, House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio and House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi of California.
Democrats war'n: stimulus
not a quick economic fix

Two-thirds of
$825B package to
go to new spending
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
White House warned yesterday
that the country could face a long
and painful financial recovery,
even with major government inter-
vention to stimulate the economy
and save financial institutions.
"We're off and running, but it's
going to get worse before it gets
better," said Vice President Joe
Biden, taking the lead on a theme
echoed by other Democratic offi-
cials on the Sunday talk shows.
At the end of the Obama admin-
istration's first week, the party

ect was $3.1 million, funded by the
College of Engineering.
Munson said the current proj-
ect would benefit both students
and faculty, with not only new
research facilities but also new
educational tools, including the
construction of new classrooms.
"We're certainly looking at
transforming at least a part of the
G.G. Brown building," Munson
said. "New classrooms that are far
more student friendly. It's not all
about the research side. We also
want to make a building that's at-
tractive for students, including
more space for team projects."
In the capital outlay project pro-
cess, which has been in place for
several decades, state universities
in Michigan can submit proposals
to the state each year to get fund-
ing for major educational projects,
said Cynthia Wilbanks, vice presi-
dent for government relations.
Wilbanks said that in the past,
it was required that the university
submitting the request provides
25 percent of the funding for the
project, with the state funding the

in power at both ends of Penn-
sylvania Avenue sought to lower
expectations for a quick fix despite
legislation expected to pass by next
month that would pump billions of
dollars into the economy. Demo-
crats also opened the door for even
more government aid to struggling
banks beyond the $700 billion bail-
out already in the pipeline.
Congress has given President
Barack Obama permission to
spend the second $350 billion of a
Wall Street bailout package even
though lawmakers have criticized
the Bush administration for the
way it spent the first half. House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,
said she is open to additional gov-
ernment rescue money for banks
and financial institutions. But she
other 75 percent. But given the
current economic downturn, pro-
portions for project funding have
changed.
"In more recent years, because
of the constrained budget environ-
ment, those rates have been differ-
ent," Wilbanks said. -Therr'a a lit-
tle more flexibility and negotiation
of what the support might be."
Wilbarakssaidthe Universitysub-
raits a top proposai for a construc-
tion or renovation project as part of
the capital outlay request each year.
The state then decides which proj-
ects it can fund and which projects
will be placed on a list for possible
funding at a later time.
The G.G. Brown renovation and
addition proposal was submitted
to the state as part of the Univer-
sity's capital outlay request for
the 2009 fiscal year. The cost of
the project was then estimated at
$133 million dollars but was not
approved by the state.
Wilbanks said there have been
a number of smaller renovation
projects to the University's edu-
cational and research facilities in
the past decade, including Mason
and Angell Halls, which have been
funded through the capital outlay
program. But the University has

said taxpayers must get an own-
ership stake in return.
Biden said Obama's choice for
Treasury secretary, Timothy Gei-
thner, will recommend whether
more money is needed for the
banks. Geithner could be con-
firmed by the Senate as early as
today.
Congress is working on an $825
billion economic recovery package
that dedicates about two-thirds to
new government spending and the
rest to tax cuts. Separate propos-
als making their way through the
House and Senate would combine
tax cuts for individuals and busi-
nesses, help for cash-strapped state
governments, aid for the poor and
unemployed, and direct spending

campaign, Ayers became the sub-
ject of much political attention as
Republicans tried to make the case
that President Barack Obama's con-
nection to Ayers, which involved
them serving on an education board
together, made him a poor choice
for president. In early October, Re-
publican vice presidential-nominee
Sarah Palin said, "Our opponent
though, is someone who sees Amer-
ica it seems as being so imperfect
that he's palling around with ter-
rorists who would target their own
country?"- an indirect reference
to Ayers's time as a leader of the
Weather Underground.
Tom Hallock, associate publisher
and director of marketing, sales and
subsidiary rights for Beacon Press,
said he expects Ayers to talk about
his book, his role in last year's presi-
dential campaign and the recent
events in national politics.
"The right wing launched a
multi-million dollar campaign, so
Bill was kind of unwillingly thrust
into the 2008 campaign," Hallock
said. "That's what gave us all the
publicity for the new paperback
edition."
"He will talk about the book,
what it's like to be manipulated by
the right in that way," Hallock add-
ed. "He and his audience will want
to talk about the current shift in
American politics and progressive
approaches to politics under the
Obama administration."
Melissa Levine, University Li-
brary exhibits and outreach librar-
ian, said the events of the 2008
presidential election echoed the
political affairs of 1968, a time in
which Ayers was at the forefront of
social and political activism.
"Ayers had a significant role in
national events in 1968 and again
in 2008," Levine said. "It's im-
portant for students today to re-
alize how the recent presidential
election is proximately related to,
events in 1968."
Levine said despite Ayers's con-
troversial history as a member of
Students for a Democratic Society
and the Weather Underground, his
upcomig rt c is an educational
event in which students will get a

glimpse into a divisive time in the
nation's past.
"What makes Ayers controver-
sial today is the violence associated
with his viewpoint," Levine said.
"It is worthwhile for us to hear di-
rectly from the source - from Ayers
himself - what it was he was doing
in the '60s and early '70s, why he
adopted the militant position that
he did and how he regards those
positions and actions a generation
later.'
Many people on campus, includ-
ing students and faculty, support
Ayers's right to speak at the Univer-
sity.
"We completely support his free-
dom to speak on this campus," said
Nathaniel Eli Coats Styer, chair of
the University's chapter of College
Democrats. "He's a notable figure in
history."
Others on campus, including
Brady Smith, chair of the Universi-
ty's chapter of College Republicans,
disagreed with Ayers' upcoming
presentation.
"Shaman Drum is certainly en-
titled to invite him to speak," Smith
said. "I think what's more troubling
is the University's willingness to
collaborate on it."
Smith said that Ayers's history
as a "violent activist" makes him a
questionable figure to address the
University.
"What's very disappointing to
me is that the University would
invite someone who's unrepentant
for his violent actions against the
U.S., to use its space to promote his
demagography and his violence and
illegal course of action," said Smith,
who compared Ayers's speech to
Columbia University inviting Irani-
an President Mahmoud Ahmadine-
jad to speak in 2007.
Vincent Hutchings, associate
professor of political science, said
he believes Ayers is trying to restore
his public persona and defend his
point of view by addressing mem-
bers of the University community.
"The effort of the speaking tour
is to rehabilitate his image because
of the negative comments that were
expressed about him during the
presidential campaign," Hutchings
said. "He's seeking ultimately to tell
his side of the story."

Wasting students' time
MSA should focus its attention on campus issues first
fter two long, drawn-out meetings on January 13 and 21,
the Michigan Student Assembly finally passed the reso-
lution that it had debated for so long. This all-important,
time-consuming resolution was a statement expressing regret
for the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. As the student government
of the University, MSA is supposed to represent the students and
work toward solving issues that concern them. But yet again, it
has neglected its responsibility to students and wasted time argu-
ing about an issue over which it has no jurisdiction to address. If
MSA wants to earn respect, it must mount a tangible effort to solve
some of the issues that pertain to campus life for students instead

No Kennedys need apply

i

of issuing pointless statements.
MSA has spent the majority of its last two
meetings debating over resolutions about
the crisis in Gaza. A Thursday night's meet-
ing, the assembly finally settled on a resolu-
tion calling for the American Movement for
Israel and Students Allied for Freedom and
Equality to c ome together with any other
interested students and screen a documen-
tary about Arabic and Jewish women coex-
isting peacefully. This was a compromise
resolution after a more strongly worded
resolution calling for a permanent cease fire
failed to pass.
The problem with the approved resolution
is not that it doesn't do enough to address the
crisis in Gaza. The problem is that MSA is
spending its tite on the issue. Despite what
members of the assembly may think, their
personal feelings about the situation in Gaza
should not come before their commitment to
dealing with campus issues.
There are plentyof issues that students are
trusting MSA to hsandle. The assembly needs
to follow through on its promise of better
lighting across camuspus. It needs to improve
its website - including actually posting the
minutes from its meetings - so that students
have a way of checking up and seeing what's
going on in MSA. Representatives need to
confront campus crime. And, as the Univer-

sity faces the prospect of decreased fund-
ing from the state, students are counting
on MSA to be their voice for college afford-
ability. What we're getting now is a student
government that cares more about debating
distant international issues than discussing
the improvements students need.
Every election cycle, MSA representatives
promise to take care of these issues, and
every MSA session, the results are disap-
pointing. If MSA fulfilled its promises and
worked with students, perhaps its elections
would see a rise in voter turnout. Last elec-
tion only 9.6 percent of campus voted. This
isn't surprising, because students have vir-
tually no way to express dissatsfaction with
MSA's single party, the Michigan Action
Party, aside from simply not voting. And this
allows MSA to get away with not serving
students' needs.
At the root of this problem may simply be
the way that MSA views itself. Actions like
the unnecessary Gaza resolution reveal that
the members of MSA think it's more impor-
tant to pretend to be the U.S. Senate than
representatives elected to confront the prob-
lems of University students. MSA represen-
tatives must hold themselves accountable to
students' wishes and work for students to
improve campus.

There's something with Ameri-
cans that makes us hate enti-
tlement. We just can't stand
people who think
they should get
something just
because it's their
prerogative, and
naturally coupled
with that is our love
of underdogs. ButI
there are problems
that arise when we IMRAN
so easily generalize SYED
about who the good
and bad guys are.
When I first
heard that Caroline Kennedy might
be appointed to fill the New York Sen-
ate seat vacated by Hillary Clinton, an
almost embarrassing excitement over-
took me. Always a pragmatic skeptic,
I'm generally not easily bowled over.
And yet here I was, swept away at the
prospect of President John Kennedy's
daughter goingto the Senate.
My excitement went beyond just the
creepy fixation alot of people have with
the Kennedys. Caroline is a lawyer who
has written books on civil liberties and
the Constitution. To a law student like
me, that counts for at least six years of
political experience. That, along with
the very personal endorsement she gave
to Barack Obama and the vibrant (even
if not prolific) voice she became on the
campaign trail, seemed to make her
one among many appropriate choices
for New York Gov. David Paterson to
consider.
And then came the backlash, mostly
from those salt-o'-the-Earth New York-
ers (iced lattos and all) decrying what
they saw as prissy entitlement: "Caro-
line Kennedy isn't experienced enough.
She isn't enough of a New Yorker. She's
just a child of privilege blinded by van-
ity."
Some of that criticism is true. Ken-
nedy has never held political office,
and the Senate is an assumptive place

to start. Although she attended Colum-
bia Law School and has lived in New
York City most of her life, Kennedy
hasn't exactly had an ear pressed to the
ground for news regarding the rest of
the state. And while she appears to be
a very grounded person, entertaining
even the thoughtcof being nominated to
the Senate without any political expe-
rience does hint at a sense of entitle-
ment.
But these are all little things. What
politician doesn't have a sense of enti-
tlement? (Isn'tit arequirement, really?)
At least Kennedy has lived in New York
for mostofher life, whichis muchmore
than could be said for Hillary Clinton.
And after an election where NewYork-
ers overwhelmingly supported Obama,
they hardly have the right to throw
Kennedy's lack of experience in her
face.
Yet, while Kennedy did have a
solid rank of supporters, the backlash
steadily gained steam in recent weeks.
Kennedy's abrupt decision last week
to withdraw herself from consider-
ation for the seat was almost certainly
a result of her seeingthe writing on the
wall.
For hardworking, everyday Ameri-
cans, liking an affluent Kennedy is
tough. It's much easier to embrace an
underdog because we like our heroes
to rise from being face down in the
streets, not from the laps of presidents
(George W. Bush was an unfortunate
aberration). We like someone we can
point at as we tell our kids thatthey can
do anything if they really try.
For example, let me describe to you
the exact type of hero we like. Imag-
ine a poor boy, a son of poor Serbian
immigrants, living in a poor Chicago
neighborhood. His father is a poor steel
worker; his family is poor, so he works
odd jobs to make some money. Some-
how he rises from all that poorness
to go to college, does well enough to
transfer to Northwestern University
and then goes on to get a law degree.

Tearing up yet? Is this ultimate under-
dog overload or what? Wait, it actually
gets better. Our poor immigrant boy
goes into politics and becomes the gov-
ernor of Illinois.
Yes, that's the true story of Rod
Blagojevich.
Obviously, not all underdogs are slea-
zy, andI'mcertainlynotsayingthatrich
people should be handed everythin
in life. That would be an awful state
of affairs where incompetent people
would be in power just because of who
their fathers were. But actively work-
ing to preclude people who may have

stand a chance.
had famous fathers is just as bad: They
'have the right tobe considered just like
any other qualified person. Kennedy is
hardly the first to think she is entitled
to a Senate seat, and she has plenty of
reasons for thinking so. But why is she
the only one who has to answer for her
family, her name and her money? ,
Whilenotnearlyas harshordestruc-
tive as racism or sexism, this obsession
with the little guy and this vindictive
hatred of those who may not have had
to work seven jobs through highschool
really amounts to a prejudice (the same
prejudice recently espoused in the
jingoistic, "real America" stylings of
Sarah Palin). And prejudices, no matter
how well-meaning or minimal, always
have nasty consequences.

Outlaws no more

I would like to thank Yannick Wood for con-
tributing to the cheating paranoia of the faculty
at the University. His viewpoint outlined how
often he chsested in his language courses (Out-
laws in the MI I t01/12/09). He then went on to
express his own conspiracy theory about how all
of his fellow foreign language students are cheat-
ing as well.
I just ant to say t this is totally untrue.
Two of my r:sssmmates have been accused
of cheating, evsen though they'd done nothing
wrong (they were both exonerated). I'm not sure
what would compel one student to purge his
conscience by not only claiming that cheating
in undergraduate laguage courses was under-
stood, but also thiat it was expected.
I took Spanish 22 not because I needed it
to graduate, but ictually because I was looking
forward to leL'rn iig mi !ore about the language. I
understand thratr mna students at this Univer-
sitytake their laishm sue esourses just to fulfill the
language requiremiseit, but I would also suggest
that they tae a linguage that interests them.
Wood appIears to have taken French for his
language requirernent an id, according to him,
cheated on many of the tests in order to receive
a higher gr ade.
In light o this, I would also like to thank Wood
for thlrowing) into dolt the integrity of the grade
that I rcei ed I: i: mviyngu age courses. I have
work e1ha ia,' f r eey Erade that I have received
at this Univ eesity. I espict my fellow students to
do the sii:. : I c i:: sounderstand that some
studeints psrsi lly use sssome "extra" means to help
secure ih:ir grsde. I cannot condemn anyone
for using wsv e "tools" they have, but I can-
not sy mi lpai ,6i ' vi one student consfessing his
wrongi:i.n is i' , ent ire University and cast-
ing a shla dsw isupo iie eacomsplishments of every
other language student.
JA SON MAHAd iANd

Unfortunately, Wood went even further than
just confessing. He actually made the claim that
his actions were perfectly legit because everyone
else does it. But this ancient defense mechanism
of saying, "Well, everybody does it," is not a valid -
excuse for the actions of one individual.
Wood also argued that it wasn't his fault
because the teachers made him do it. He blamed
the professors' choice of material, claiming that
it was outdated. I will concede that perhaps, in
his case, some of the material had been used
before. But even if this material had been slight-
ly outdated, this reason in itself does not excuse
his actions. Our professors deserve respect.
Cheating in class and advertising this fact is bla-
tantly disrespectful to teachers and to the stu-
dent body.
While some material could benefit from
an update, other language courses have been
revaped. My Spanish 232 class had new books
tht my professor had written. She was connect-
ed with the text and enthusiastic about teaching
students abougSpanish culture.Wood, inhisrude
viewpoint, suggested that his professors haven't
made the material interesting enough for him to
put in the full effort. Perhaps he just didn't take
the right course for him. All the same, cheating
was not the way to handle a dull class.
Wood confused his own situaionby relaingiy
to the rest of the student body at large. I sincerely
hope that no profesor will read his words and
believe that a majority of their students haven't
chosen to put in the work required to receive a
good grade. Hopefully, no more of my roommates
will be accused of cheating because one student
thought he could assuage his own guilt by blam-
ingnot only all language students, but the profes-
sors as well.

HAMDAN YOUSUF I VI T
WhyMSA addresses issues outside A2

In recent days, students have expressed their frustra-
tion with the Michigan Student Assembly's resolution on
the situation in Gaza. I wholeheartedly agree. But the issue
is not that MSA should spend its time on more "relevant"
matters. Tuition hikes and campus safety are major issues
of concern for all of us, but MSA would do a disservice to
the student body were it to remain silent in the face of glob-
al tragedy. The resolution passed last Tuesday is an inad-
equate response to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. And
we can be silent no longer.
As a student of public health, I study epidemics and
disease prevention. In my classes, I learn about using
statistical models to improve quality of life and to tackle
cutting-edge problems in genomics, survival analysis, and
cancer research. Our school hosts seminars and colloquia
on socioeconomic inequities in the healthcare system. And
yet I am asked to take in all that knowledge and remain
on the sidelines as I see 1,300 innocent lives being lost in
a matter of weeks. Over 300 children are massacred and
5,000 civilians are wounded. How can I be expected to
ignore that?
A temporary ceasefire may have been reached, but make
no mistake, a catastrophe of human suffering looms in the
horizon. Four hundred thousand people - 1 in 3 Gazans
- are without running water today. Fifty thousand people
have been left homeless. That's more than the University's
entire student body. They may not have to deal with nega-
tive 15 degree wind chills, but tonight, they have no place
to sleep and no roof over their heads because their homes
were blown up and destroyed. As we celebrate the inaugu-
ration of President Obama, in some remote corner of the
world, a young child is digging through the rubble to find
the charred remains of his mother's body. How can anyone
tell me that isn't relevant?
Don't let anyone tell you this is about politics or contro-
versy. This is about a humanitarian crisis. It has nothing
to do with black or white or brown, rich or poor, Arab or
Israeli, Muslim or Jewish. Too many excuses have been
made for our inaction and too many false reasons given
for why we should continue about our daily lives without
a care for the pains of the rest of the world. Today we must

say enough.
Let us shelve for goodthe stereotypical view of the "ugly
American": narrow-minded, self-centered, absorbed in a
little bubble, nodding along to an iPod and utterly oblivi-
ous to the rest of the world. Let's look beyond the narrow4
confines of our pristine campus. Let's have the strength to
dream of a better, more peaceful world.
The past weeks have seen hundreds of our fellow stu-
dents take to the streets, braving the bitter cold, to make
their voices heard. Some would criticize those of us who
choose to speak up; such matters are better left to the Unit-
ed Nations, they remark sarcastically. President Obama
addressed such "haters" in his Inaugural Address. "Their
memories are short," he said. "For they have forgotten
what this country has already done; what free men and
women can achieve when imagination is joined to common
purpose, and necessity to courage."
Michigan is no ordinary school, and ours is no ordinary
student body. We inherit a rich and storied heritage of stu-
dent activism and we must strive to live up to its legacy.
After all, it was Michigan students who protested against
apartheid South Africa. When this university wouldn't hire
black professors, it was our students who took over admin-
istration buildings. When President Johnson ordered the
bombing of North Vietnam, our students - and faculty -
united behind the rallying cry of "Not in our name." With
such a powerful precedent before us, how then can we b
silent today?
These are powerful times we live in. Who could have
ever imagined that a black man with a middle name of
Hussein would become President? Let us draw strength
from the symbolism of that moment and draw the cour-
age to speak up for our convictions, to turn our attention
beyond our problem sets and our papers and our classes.
Let it not be said that the students at this great institution'
the leaders of the future, were deaf to the pleas of suffering
Gazans. Let it not be said that we considered their plight
"irrelevant."

Avoiding spoilers
like the plague

You thinking what I'm thinking?" "Yea. Arby's it is."
Notorousl y bad

Spoiler alert! This column may con-
tain crucial plot information from
my next column. Don't keep reading
if you don't want to know what happens in
two weeks.
This is your last chance.
OK. To those coura-
geous men and women 3
among you who braved-
the spoiler warning,
congratulations, there
aren't actually going to be
spoilers after all - mainly BLOCK
because even I don't know
what I'm going to write
about in two weeks time. But aren't you glad
to have been warned? To those of you who
cling to this column's every word (Hi, Mom),
aren't you glad that next week hasn't been
ruined for you?
Spoilers (information about the plot of
something not yet released) are becoming a
real problem - nay, a plague - for the busy
TV viewer. They have infested the Internet,
private conversations, news publications and
even television itself. And like any plague,
the only way to avoid spoilers is complete
solitary confinement.
As someone who principally watches
plot-driven shows - "Lost" and "Heroes"
especially - and reality competitions (I loves
me some "So You Think You Can Dance"),
it's very important to me not to know what's
coming next. But, sadly, my life cannotbe
spent entirely in front of the television, and
sometimes I have to wait a day or more
before I watch the latest episode of one of my
shows. That will be happening for this entire
season of "Lost," for instance. I need to be at
the Daily on Wednesday nights putting out
The B-side for you all to read the next morn-
ing while you talk about what happened to
Locke and Sawyer on the island.
When I miss a show like "Lost," I have no
choice but to become a hermit crab until I get
a chance to watch the new episode, emerging
from my shell only to order food or use the
bathroom. And even those things sometimes
have to get put on hold (thank God for empty
Mountain Dew bottles).
Like real hermit crabs, I also can't log
on to Facebook, because people might have
changed their statuses to relevant things
like "OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE (important
plot-related thing) HA1PPENED ON THAT
SHOW!t!!" I can't go to any site with news;
even Yahoo and CNN run stories ranging
from pure plot information to actor profiles
that might indicate whether an actor has
left a show - which usually means they got
killed-off. Ifnothing else, these sites always
say who got voted off of "American Idol."
And I can't even use AIM, just in case some-
one sends me an excited but overly informa-

tive instant message, meaning well but not
realizing my ignorance.
But more importantly, I can't even watch
TV. Bravo is always running ads for "Top
Chef" and "Project Runway," which I rarely
have the time to watch when they actually
air. So when I see a commercial for the next
episode, it gives away who was or wasn't
eliminated in the episode I missed.
For shows like "Lost" and "Heroes," the
spoilers can be a matter of life and death (for
the characters, if not me). If an expendable
character is on the brink of death at the end
of an episode, but I miss the one that follows,
I'll inevitably find out whether that person
died in the ads for the next episode. This
completely ruins the suspense of the episode
I have yet to watch, turning me off to the
series as a whole.
What has made this such an epidemic
is the fact that most people are not as kind
as I was at the beginning of this column.
Internet blogs and Facebook users rarely
provide spoiler warnings. Commercials
for TV shows always show clips from the
upcoming episode before viewers have a
chance to realize what show is being adver-
tised and avert their gaze. Admittedly,
when people talk about a TV event that has
already happened, it might not technically
be a spoiler, but it's close enough that it
pisses me off.
Yep, Dumbledore
dies. Olops. Sorry.
If any of you think I'm overreacting, mayI
bring you back in time to when a certain tale
of witchcraft and wizardry was just releas-
ing its sixth installment? (SPOILER ALERT)
Perchance you remember a certain old
wizard who met a certain demise. Perhaps
you were one of the unlucky few to be the
victim of a "Dumbledore dies" flyer, Inter-
net site, T-shirt, e-mail, Facebook status or
overheard conversation. Imagine having to
avoid something that sinister and ubiquitous
on a weekly basis. That is the torment of the
TV fan who also happens to have a real life
(however nerdy that life may be).
Well, that brings this episode toa close.
On the next "TV/New Media Column," did
Jamie escape from the pit of snakes and dis-
mantle the bomb? Yes, he did, because you
can clearly see him alive in one of the clips in
the commercial. Dammit.
Block will inflict grave injury upon you
if you send him spoilers. At your own risk,
e-mail him atjamblock@umich.edu

New biopic of The
Notorious B.I.G. does no
justice to the life of the
inspiring rapper
By ANDREW LAPIN
Daily Film Editor
The music of The Notorious B.IG.
seems to strike a chord
with everyone in our
generation, and it tran-
scends race, gender Notorious
and socioeconomic sta-
tus more than 10 years At Showcase
after his death. Even and Quality16
University students Fox Searchlight
from far more privi-
leged backgrounds
tape posters of him to their dorm room

walls. This is a big part of why he has
become one of the most iconic rappers
ever. But on the basis of his character-
ization in "Notorious," maybe he's not
so worthy of that status.
The movie is certainly well-inten-
tioned. It would have to be, since Biggie's
longtime friend Sean "Diddy" Combs,
who has spent significant portions of
his own career immortalizing the man's
image, is the executive producer. And
there's never any hint of maliciousness
on the part of perfectly competent direc-
tor George Tillman Jr. ("Men of Honor")
or the actor who portrays Christopher
"Biggie" Wallace, rapper Jamal "Gravy"
Woolard. But once all of Biggie's bases
have been covered, the audience still lacks
a deep understanding of just why the man
was so well-loved despite his many flaws
(including, as the film makes obvious, his
disrespect of women).
The opening scenes establish Wallace

as a relatively well-off inner-city youth.
He had a stable home life with a dot-
ing mother and attended a nice school
where students wore uniforms. In fact,
he seemed to start dealing drugs purely
by choice - the only explanation given
is that he felt the hoodlum life "calling"
to him. What did he see in the thugs on
the street that made him want to become
one? Did he find the lifestyle glamorous,
or was it just peer pressure? These are the
sorts of questions that this film should've
explored.
Mostly, "Notorious" tells a fairly typi-
cal rags-to-riches story: Biggie and his
crew put together a mixtape to give
to Puffy (Derek Luke, "Miracle at St.
Anna") at Bad Boy Records, who signs
him. Eventually, word spreads and Biggie
puts a best-selling album together and
subsequently must deal with the perils
of fame.

KAMPFER
From Page 1A
Kampfer was released from the
hospital Sunday after being held
for precautionary measures, ac-
cording to Michigan officials.
"I have a strained neck right
now," Kampfer told the Detroit
Free Press in a Sunday phone in-
terview. "I had no relapse of what
happened earlier. Hopefully, I'll be
back this weekend."
Conboy's initial hit was pre-
sumably in retaliation against
Kampfer for knocking Tropp off
his skates with a clean open-ice hit
moments earlier. Tropp received
a five-minute major for slashing,
two 10-minute misconducts and
a double game-disqualification,

which means a minimum three-
game suspension. But Conboy was
just penalized with a double minor
for roughing.
"I don't want to comment on it
because I didn't see it," Michigan
coach Red Berenson said after Sat-
urday's game. "Their coach said
he would deal with their player."
After the game, Michigan State
coach Rick Comley quickly con-
demned his players' actions.
"They fought hard, and what
happened at the end is not good
for hockey," Comley told the State
News. "I'll deal with our kid."

Ex-'U' student caughtin sex sting

Student arraigned
for prostitution,
using computer to
commit a crime
By STEPHANIE STEINBERG
Daily StaffReporter
A former University student was
arraigned Thursday for engaging in
prostitution and using a computer
to commita crime.
Diane Brown, spokeswoman
for the University's Department
of Public Safety, said the Ann Ar-
bor Police Department received an
anonymous tip in November about

someone who was conducting
prostitution. AAPD investigators
staged a sting at an Ann Arbor hotel
in which an investigator posed as a
prospective client.
The 21-year-old Ann Arbor na-
tive was arrested on site, and pros-
ecutors subsequently authorized
two misdemeanor charges for pros-
titution/soliciting and using a com-
puter to commit a crime.
Brown said the woman had ad-
vertised her . services on several
online sites, but her prostitution
activity is a more serious crime.
"There are a lot of things that
are out on the Internet that are il-
legal activities that are rarely dealt
with," Brown said. "Her illegal ac-
tivity was the incident at the hotel.

If a prosecutor reviews the case and
sees that the computer was also a
part of contributing to the crime,
then they will add on that second
charge of using a computer to com-
mit a crime. "
Defense attorney Nicholas Rou-
mel said the incident is not what
people might envision as stereo-
typical prostitution.
"I think it's a somewhat sym-
pathetic situation," he said. "I'm
hoping there will be a reasonable
outcome."
According to Brown, the woman
wasn't registered for classes this se-
mester or last semester but was en-
rolled at the University last winter.
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham said she couldn't

comment about why the woman
dropped out of the University due
to privacy reasons.
This is the second case in the last
month where a student associated
with the University has advertised
herself online.
Brown said this incident was
unrelated to last month's sex case
where a University professor solic-
ited sexual acts from a law student
who advertised on Craigslist to
help pay tuition costs.
Yaron Eliav, associate professor
in the Department of Near East-
ern Studies, and the Law School
student both pleaded no contest
to a misdemeanor charge of using
a computer to commit a crime in
December.


TOEFL
From Page 1A
Other exams are administered on
a computer, which MELAB pro-
moters argue can be intimidating
and problematic with technology
glitches.
The English Language Institute
attributes the popularity of the
exam to the MELAB's ability to ac-
commodate numerous test takers
because with a paper-based exam,
limited computer availability isn't
an issue.
The roughly three-hour exam
costs $80, with an additional $40
for the oral exam. The TOEFL
costs $140 and has paper and In-
ternet test-taking options.
The English Language Insti-
tute, founded in 1941, has gained
recognition for its language re-
search and teaching programs.
Today it's well-known for its

testing resources, including the
MELAB.
Additionally, the center plans to
promote the program and encour-
age those schools that have not yet
made MELAB acceptable in their
admissions to do so. While the
MELAB has experienced notable
growth, it is currently nowhere
near as widely-accepted as the
TOEFL.
About 250 institutions accept
the MELAB. The TOEFL is cur-
rently accepted by more than
6,000 institutions inmore than 130
countries.
MELAB Coordinator Barbara
Rose said the market for English
language proficiency exams is
likely to continue growing.
"It's flourishing. As more and
more people come to the U.S. and
Canada to further their education,
they have to show their English
proficiency," Rose said. "We're
very busy."

and quick to fall in love. An important
choice awaits you this year. Choosc
wisely.

The bigger they are,
the worse their movie

NOTORIOUS
From Page 5A
"Notorious" does its part to
acknowledge that, for better or
worse, the life story of Biggie
Smalls will forever be entwined
with the story of Tupac Shakur
and the East Coast/West Coast
hip hop rivalry of the '90s. Big-
gie, from New York, and Tupac
(Anthony Mackie, "Eagle Eye"),
from Los Angeles, begin their
careers as good friends, and
their paths meet at key points in
the movie. After Tupac was shot
by unidentified assailants in Big-
gie's recording studio, their two
companies grew divided and
tensions escalated to the point
where both icons were shot to
death within months of each
other.
Sadly, the film's script doesn't
volunteer any of the conspiracy
theories that often surround the
three shooting incidents, which
could have at least lent "Noto-
rious" a "JFK" vibe and given
audiencessomethingto debate. It

also could have been worthwhile
to further explore the rivalry
between these two rap artists
and what implications it had on
the genre as a whole. Without
pursuing any of these details, the
movie's story becomes too insu-
lar to care about.
Yes, Biggie was a well-loved
guy. It's obvious in the touch-
ing closing scene that re-creates
his funeral procession through
Brooklyn and shows his moth-
er (Angela Bassett, "Meet the
Browns") crying as she looks
upon the throngs of fans chant-
ing his name. But before this
culmination, she vehemently
disproved of his rapping and
lifestyle, which doesn't make her
final reaction seem well-earned.
Additionally, the epitaph dis-
played on the screen before the
credits intends to sum up Big-
gie's life in one laughably generic
statement ("He proved no dream
is too big"), but it sounds like it
was hastily scribbled by Diddy
on the last day of post-produc-
tion. If the skytruly was the limit
for Biggie, then "Notorious" does
iniustice to the sky.

From the courtroom to the kidnapping, Jack Bauer is kind of a dick.
A non-negotiable comeback

After a lackluster
sixth season, Jack
Bauer is back
with an attitude
By CAROLYN KLARECKI
DailyArts Writer
When a show's plot becomes

ship declines,
sometimes all it 24
needs to recover
is a year-and- SaSon Seven
a-half break. Mondays
At least that's at 9 p.m.
what worked a9X
for "24." After a
noticeable dive
in quality during its sixth season,
FOX's "24" began the redemption
process in its two-night, four-hour
season seven premiere. Each hour
was filled with nonstop action and
thrilling twists that revived the
show's knack for compelling, multi-
dimensional stories.
Set almost two years after the end
of the sixth season, the show first
revisits Jack Bauer, still brilliantly
portrayed by Kiefer Sutherland
("Phone Booth"), as he is being inter-

rogated at a U.S. Senate hearing. In
the hearing, senators question Bauer
about the violent interrogation tech-
niques he used while working for the
now-dismantled Counter Terrorist
Unit. Of course, just a short time into
the questioning, a threat to national
security erupts and Bauer is thrust
back into action and enlisted by the
FBI tohelp followalead.As hebegins
to connect the dots in that way only
he can, he uncovers a multi-layered
conspiracy to hold hostage the gov-
ernment's crucial computer system.
Through all this commotion he is
constantly forced to choose between
following procedure or breaking the
rules to get results. The addition of
the Senate hearing to start the sea-
son gives this struggle a stronger
sense of significance.
Season seven, also introduces
an almost entirely new cast whose
complexities add fresh suspense and
intrigue to the show. New charac-
ter FBI Agent Renee Walker (Annie
Wersching, "General Hospital") has
been hesitant to break with FBI pro-
cedure, but the stress of the escalat-
ing terrorist plot makes her quickly
question her values. The new and
optimistic President Allison Taylor
(Cherry Jones, "The Village"), who
ran on a platform of non-negotiation
with terrorists, may also act contrary
to her previous notions to protect

American lives this season. Refocus-
ing on these multifaceted struggles
is sure to help this season propel
"24" to its former glory.
The fact that "24" contains so
much action while taking place in
real time has always been impres-
sive. But the producers did away
with the iconic clock in the bottom
corner of the screen this season,
using a clock only for transitions
to-and-frotm commoercial hreaks.
This season, the show doesn't cling
to the real-time gimmick as fer-
vently as it once did, and that's a
good thing; it cuts the show some
much-deserved slack.
Not only is "24" well-developed,
its creative team has a high social
awareness which transcends that of
most other popular programming.
More than ever before, this season
focuses on the morality of torture
as an effective method in obtaining
information. Jack's inner battle over
what constitutes right and wrong
combined with the drama of the Sen-
ate hearingembodythis debate. Sim-
ilarly, the genocide occurring in the
fictional African country of Sengala
is an echo of similar crises in Sudan,
Congo and Rwanda. These themes
are debated under the leadership of a
new, female President who promised
to usher in a new age and bring hope
to the. American people. Why does

that all sound so familiar?
Jack Bauer isn't the quintessen-
tial hero. He often does undeniably
terrible things to serve the greater
good, but the real world isn't black
and white, and the two sides of
Jack make his character believable.
Viewers root for President Taylor
to establish her position as a world
leader because her stance on the
civil war in Sengala and overall ide-
alisma is something we would like
to see in our own executive. Even
though "24" avoids mentioning
dates, the use of familiar scenarios
and current events will help view-
ers relate to the show.
TV shows with intricate plots
and well-developed characters are
relatively rare. And even more rare
are those that succeed over a long
period of time. "24" is unique in its
ability to produce both consistently
thrilling action and an intriguing
story, placing it among the essen-
tial TV shows to watch this winter.
Yes, Jack Bauer will still be doing
what he does best - bringing down
terrorists in record time - but "24"
is truly new this season, and it's
bound to be more thought-provok-
ing than it has ever been before. As
long as the writers have learned
not to let the plot get out of control,
"24" will finally return to its must-
see TV status.

Product placement on
its biggest stage ever

BLART
From Page 5A
into that Chrysler. And when
Blart gets harassing phone calls
on his makeshift cell from an
Indian teen, the viewer's mind
wanders off, struggling to find
the humor in the situation.
But the film's fascination comes
in the politics of representation for
mall-going America. And no, this
isn't reading too much into the
film. If you actually see this (for
whatever reason), you'll notice
"Mall Cop" is full of flagranthbrand
gallivanting and mall culture.
Seeing Sony products (Colum-
bia's parent company) strewed
everywhere while the hypogly-
cemic Blart brandishes Pixy Stix

to save his life, one can't help but
wish these items were integrated
with the story in a way that's not
just an infomercial. James Bond at
least made plot devices out of his
cars and alcohol. And remember
Tina Fey and her General Electric
baiting on "30 Rock?" That's how
it's done.
Failure as a comedy and lead
actor showcase aside, "Mall Cop"
is an interesting but depressing
study in what happens when the
studio calls all the shots. Not only
is the climax of the film set in a
Rainforest Cafe, but it features
plenty ofnice close-ups to letpeo-
ple know how kooky and pleasant
dining there really is. Yes, you too
can go to-your local mall and have
an exoticrainforest feast.
Sorry. Almost forgot this was
a movie.

'M' sweeps MSU again

By MICHAEL EISENSTEIN
Daily Sports Editor
Bring on the top team in the
country: Notre Dame.
After extending its six-game
winning streak against Michigan
State with a sweep this weekend,
the No. 8 Michigan hockey team
is ready for perhaps its tough-
est test this season. The Fighting
Irish haven't lost in 20 games and
knocked the Wolverines out of last
year's Frozen Four. And fortu-
nately. for the Wolverines, junior
defenseman Steve Kampfer - who
left Yost Ice Arena on a gurney
Saturday - may even return for
the critical matchup, he told the
Detroit Free Press Sunday.

But there was no need for the
Wolverines to put on their game
faces after winning Saturday
night.
Acting captain Chris Summers
opened his press conference in
a joking manner, offering to ask
the media questions instead of the
other way around, and seemed
relieved that the burden of the
weekend series against the last-
place Spartans was over.
Michigan State came in try-
ing to avoid losing five games in a
season to the Wolverines for the
first time ever and attempting to
partially derail Michigan's post-
season hopes.
The Wolverines had to rebound
from last weekend's home shutout

loss to 11th-place Bowling Green
and inch up into the top-four slots
of the CCHA standings. They did

"To me, you can't beat those

The Wolverines (12-6 CCHA,

way tie for fourth in the confer-
ence, just four points behind
second-place Miami (Ohio).

With less than a minute to play, Michigan
Stateforward Andrew Conboy punched
Michigan defenseman Steve Kampfer
from behind, knocking him to the ice.

As Kampfer lay motionless on the ice, Spar-
tan forward Corey Tropp skated toward the
boards and, with his stick, slashed Kampfer
in the head and neck region.

Senior volverine torwara I ir vinier was
closest to the play and first to retaliate
after Tropp's slashing. A small scuffle
ensued among the other skaters.

Iropp received a major penary for slasi-h
ing, two10-minute misconducts and a
double-game disctuaification. Conboy
drew a double minor for roughing.

"Coaches don't send someone on the ice
to do something, no matter what fans
think," Michigan State coach Rick
Comley said after the game.

join them in Los Angeles as what
is undoubtedly the strongest

It's not an easy sport to describe.
It best resembles soccer because

No. 22 Michigan
enjoys coaches'
performance
during victory
By FELIX CARREON
Daily Sports Writer
The thought of standing 10
meters above ground on a flimsy
board would be horrific for most.
But for Michigan diving
coaches Chris Bergere and Dick
Campbell, it provided fuel for the
intermission entertainment.
During a break in the Wolver-
ines' dual meet against Ohio State
on Friday, the two showcased
their diving skills in a short per-
formance. Dressed in pajamas,
the duo did a variety of flips.
The most impressive was a back-
flip where Campbell leapt into
Bergere's arms and the two dove
off the five-meter board at Can-
ham Natatorium.
While the No. 22 Michigan
women's swimming and diving
team enjoyed the performance,
it was hardly laughing as it com-
peted againstconference foe Ohio
State.
The Wolverines beat the Buck-
eyes 169.5-129.5 to record their
first conference win of the season.
Michigan (1-3 Big Ten, 2-6
overall) had no trouble finding

motivation for the dual meet. The
team is still recovering from a
rigorous training camp in Puerto
Rico that left many swimmers
drained in meets and practices.
"It's like I told them before
the meet - I don't care if it is tid-
dlywinks or 47-man squamish,"
Michigan coach Jimr Richardson
said. "Whatever it is, it's Michi-
gan and Ohio State, and everyone
is going to pick it up a notch."
Michigan started the meet
strong with a victory in the 200-
yard medley relay. Seniors Han-
nah Smith and Christine Nichols,
freshmanCaitlin Dauw and junior
Margaret Kelly went stroke-for-
stroke against Ohio State before
Dauw pulled away in the butterfly
leg. The team finished three sec-
onds ahead of the Buckeyes (0-2,
4-3).
Both teams battled in the
beginning, before the Wolverines
won eight of the last nine events.
The Wolverines were led by
junior Leigh Cole, who earned
victories and swam season-best
times in both the 50- and 100-
yard freestyle. -
"We were ready to do that,"
Cole said. "We watched the other
teams this year, and we really
wanted to get out there and beat
Ohio State. It's such a rivalry,
Michigan and Ohio State, so it
was exciting."
Kelly kept up her consistent
level of success by touching the

wall first in the 500-yard free-
style and 200-yard individual
medley. She has been the work-
horse for the young Wolverines
all year, leading Michigan with
10 wins. She has even attempted
to cover the lack of depth in the
breaststroke by swimming the
100-yard breaststroke several
times this season.
Smith captured event titles
in the 100-yard backstroke
(55.28) and 200-yard backstroke
(1:58.66).
Kelly and Smith were part of
the victorious 400-yard freestyle
relay (3:26.56) that outpaced the
Buckeyes by four seconds. The
freestyle relays have been a high-
light for the Wolverines all season
and have earned NCAA consider-
ation times in all three events.
Michigan also dominated the
one-meter diving event, taking
four of the top five spots. Junior
Stephanie O'Callaghan placed
first andredshirtfreshmenRachel
Ropeik finished third in platform
diving (265.35) as Michigan's top
performer in the event.
The meet put the Wolverines in
good position with just two meets
left before the Big Ten Champion-
ships from Feb. 19-21.
"When it comes down to our
final meet, I think we will be
ready," Cole said. "We're going to
have some fast swimmers there.
We aren't rested yet, and we
haven't been all season."

Comeback effort falls short for Blue

By COLT ROSENSWEIG
Daily Sports Writer
STATE COLLEGE - Just one
routine from the end of Saturday
night's meet, the Michigan men's
gymnastics team brimmed with
confidence. The second-ranked
Wolverines seemed on the verge
of pulling off an improbable win
against No. 3 Penn State in the
famed Rec Hall.
One set and a few calculations
later, the Wolverines' smiles van-
ished.
Despite its comeback efforts in
the final two rotations, Michigan
came up just short, losing 348.90-
348.35 to the Nittany Lions.
The Wolverines were stunned,
and they weren't alone.
"I did have several Penn State
fans tell me the wrong team won
tonight," Michigan coach Kurt
Golder said. "When you get the
home crowd coming up and telling
you that in private, that's an indica-
tionthatmaybethings weren't quite
the way they should have been."
In the final two events, Michigan
grabbed for the victory with both
hands and outscored Penn State by
nearly two points. With intense and
unfaltering energy, the Wolverines
turned in a solid showing on high

bar and then appeared to put the
meet away on parallel bars.
After a missed opening routine
on the final event, Michigan got
right back on track. Senior Ryan
McCarthy whooped with glee as he
finished his set. Sophomore Chris
Cameron, who last week was named
Big Ten and NCAA Gymnast of the
Week, reacted with confidence as
he finished Michigan's last routine,
smiling and pointing happily to his
teammates on the sideline.
Meanwhile, the pressure seemed
to get to Penn State, especially on
the high bar, where its first four
competitors fell. Each fall means a
full point deduction from the total
score. Michigan had all the momen-
tum and, after Cameron's set,
thought it had the win.
But there was one routine left:
Penn State senior Casey Sandy on
the high bar. From the running
totals on the scoreboard, everyone
in the arena knew precisely what
Sandy would need to give his team
the win.
.And the judges gave it to him.
The 15.45 score bumped Penn State
into the lead.
The Wolverines refused to lay
blame on anyone but themselves for
the loss.
"There's no way we should have

lost to them," Cameron said. "We're
good enough to beat them and we
didn't perform tonight the way we
should've. ... We put it in (the judg-
es') hands. We let them win."
Golder chose sophomore Adam
Hamers as his unofficial Newt
Loken award winner for the best
performance of the night. The
meet's second competitor on pom-
mel horse, Hamers might have got-
ten overlooked in the fight to the
wire. But after being out of compe-
tition for a year and a half, Hamers
not only hit his set in his college
debut, he won the event (14.60).
Neither pommel horse, Michi-
gan's traditional nemesis, nor low-
scoring vault was the major factor
in the loss. The real shock came in
Michigan's second event, floor.
Historically one of the team's
biggest strengths, floor was where
the Wolverines lost the meet. Only
freshman Syque Caesar and Camer-
on, who won the event with a 15.10,
managed scores above 14. Where
the Wolverines should have had a
team total around 60 points, they
scored just 57.10.
"If we had hit some solid sets on
floor, which we had been hitting
all week, it wouldn't have been an
issue," senior Jamie Thompson said.
"So it comes down to, it's our fault."

No.16 Michigan
dominates Western
Michigan and Ball
State
By JAKE FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan men's tennis team
sat down for breakfast at 7:40 a.m.
It sat down for dinner at 10:00
p.m.
And in the 14 hours between
those meals, the 16th-ranked Wol-
verines feasted on two foes.
Michigan (2-0) bested both
Western Michigan (3-1) and Ball
State (1-2) 6-1 in a strenuous and
lengthy doubleheader at the Var-
sity Tennis Center. The Wolver-
ines outworked their opponents in
both contests and played their most
inspired tennis in a sweep of the
doubles matches against Ball State.
"We saw it fit to come out
focused and take care of business
so you don't find yourself playing a
long match late into the night when
you've already been here for four
hours," senior co-captain Peter
Aarts said.
Aarts' singles match was any-
thing but long as Ball State's Kevin
Hayward never broke serve. The
Michigan captain's long arms
delivered numerous aces, and his
tall frame seemingly glided across
the court to return difficult shots.
He claimed a decisive 6-0, 6-1 vie-
tory at No. 3 singles.
Sophomores Chris Madden and
Jason Jung competed in doubles

twofalsonbeam

Senior Peter Aarts, here against Vanderbilt in 2008, swept his opponent in singie

and singles matches in both con-
tests and were victorious in all
four showings. Jung had a painful
grimace on his face for much of his
last match against Ball State as his
exhausted legs began to cramp.
Despite the discomfort, he cruised
to a 6-2, 6-4 victory at No. 1 singles.
"After the first set, it kind of
affected me a little bit because I
didn't really want to be out there,"
Jung said. "It was a long day, I
wanted to get out. My mind wasn't
quite there at times."
Michigan coach Bruce Berque
sent a trainer to stretch Jungbefore
his sixth and final set of the day.
"In football or basketball, if
someone's cramping up, you take
a timeout, you substitute, and
you bring him back out when he's

ready," Berque said. "In tennis, you
can't afford to do that. You're not
allowed to do it."
Jung was not the only Wolverine
to turn in a gutsy performance Sat-
urday. In the early contest against
Western Michigan, redshirt fresh-
man Drew Daniel appeared out-
matched after losing his first set at
No. 6 singles. But he battled back
and won the next two sets behind
an uncharacteristically vocal
crowd. Daniel took the last four
games of the final set, earning him
a 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 win.
"It's important that he gets off
to a good start because he can help
the team a lot," Aarts said of Dan-
iel. "He's been a little up and down
the past couple months, but I think
he's got his head right now."

Wolverines squeak
past Golden Gophers
despite shaky final
rotation
By AMY SCARANO
Daily Sports Writer
Entering the last rotation of the
No. 19 Michigan women's gym-
nastics team's meet against Min-
nesota, the Wolverines' lead was
precarious at best.
But despite a nerve-racking
beam performance, the Wolver-
ines hung on to win by 0.65 points
at the Sports Pavilion in Minne-
apolis on Saturday.
"There is never security in a
gym meet when you are ending
on beam," aMichigan coach Bev
Plocki said. "Beam is really one of
those events when you can have a
great day and be consistent, but for
no apparent reason, when you're
going into balance beam, there is
never security."
Because of the way rotation
works in an all-around dual meet,
the visiting team usually faces
beam as its last rotation.
Ahead by two-tenths of a point
going into beam, Michigan (3-0
Big Ten, 7-2 overall) had no idea if
it would be able to secure the vic-

on the ice, he's girt to deal with the
impending trial of Mike Milano,
the former Michigan football play-
er charged in the Oct. 12 assault.
The preliminary hearing begins
Thursday, and if the trial continues,
Kampfer will likely have to testify.
You can't help but feel bad for
Kampfer. Twice, he's been victim-
ized in a cheap, under-handed way.
Twice, he's lain in a hospital bed
wondering what exactly happened.
And this time feels worse, if that's
possible.
The reason this on-ice attack is
going to be in the news for awhile
isn't just because it's an example
of how violent hockey can be. It's
not iust because it exemplifies the

tory. A loss would have been its
first conference defeat in almost
two years.
With six athletes competing in
each event and five counted scores,
the gymnasts had a small margin
of error, one that Michigan was
thankful for after the weekend
dual.
"I think that there are improve-
ments being made every week,"
Plocki said. "It's just that we have
to put all the pieces together in the
same competition. This is just a
team that needs to gain experience
and perform, and that will happen
as we progress through the sea-
son."
Sophomore Kylee Botterman,
competing for the first time in all-
around competition for the Wol-
verines, helped the team to victory.
Although inexperienced, she won
both the vault and floor exercises.
In an unusual finish to the dual,
Minnesota awarded Botterman a
Most Valuable Player award.
"I was a little nervous, but not
too much," Botterman said about
competing in the all-around.
"Everyone for the most part had a
great meet, and I am just excited to
go home next weekend and com-
pete all-around in our home arena
with our own fans and the crowd
cheering us on."
But not all Michigan's gymnasts

It's because it was a cowardly.

thing or a team thing, to be honest,
I think it was embarrassing.
"With the game ofhockey comes a
lot of respect for one another. These
matchups are going to get intense,
but for that team to dothat, for those
players to do that, is completely
uncalled for and unnecessary."
Even Michigan State coach Rick
Comley said the hit was cheap and
uncalled for. He said he would deal
with thesituation.
A season-ending suspension for

Two athletes fell on the beam,
meaning one of those scores was
counted.
It's rare that a team can win a
meet when it must count a fallen
score, and in the last rotation of
the meet, the Wolverines had no
chance to make up for their mis-
takes.
"It was totally ap in the air when
we had to count the fall on beam,"
Plocki said. "When the second per-
son fell, we thought we had prob-
ably lost the meet, but (Minnesota)
had their second person fall."
All the Golden Gophers had to
do to secure the win was to earn a
9.4 or better in their last floor rou-
tine, an easy feat for a collegiate
gymnast.
But Saturday, it was not so easy.
After her first tumbling pass,
Minnesota senior Jade Beattie
landed awkwardly and injured
herself. Unable to finish, she was
forced to quit and receive a score
of 2.0, giving the Wolverines their
third Big Ten victory of the sea-
son.
"That's the kind of experience
we need, being in close competi-
tion like this where there is only a'
tenth or so separating the teams,"
Plocki said. "We have to thrive

we did. We gained a lot of valu-

Gamecocks no match for
Sulahian s clutch victory

Freshman breaks
tie with win in No.6
singles, 'M' slips past
South Carolina
By GILAD BERKOWITZ
Daily Sports Writer
Leave it to a newcomer to pull
through.
In the No. 19 Michigan women's
tennis team's match against South
Carolina yesterday, freshman
Michelle Sulahian had the game
on the line - and she stepped up.
With the match tied 3-3 at the
Varsity Tennis Center, Sulahian
won the No.6 singles match to give
Michigan the win over the Game-
cocks.
"My hold at five-all was pretty
clutch because I definitely did not
want to play a tiebreaker," Sula-
hian said. "I am definitely glad I
got the set over with."
Following the back-and-forth
nature of the previous matches,
South Carolina forced a tiebreaker
in the second set.
At five-all in the tiebreaker, the
Gamecocks made a questionable
call but Sulahian refused to be
flustered.
"I thought the ball caught the
line, but I definitely was not going
to dwell on it," Sulahian said.

"Normally, I would blow up, but
with everyone watching, I stayed
calm."
Sulahian's victory came after
the Wolverines opened up dual-
match play this weekend with a
dominating performance over
Marquette.
Michigan overpowered the
Golden Eagles on Friday after-
noon. The Wolverines didn't drop
a set in singles play and secured
the doubles point with a decisive
8-3 victory led by the No. 3 doubles
team of senior Lindsey Howard
and Sulahian.
In less than 48 hours, the Wol-
verines were back on the court.
Ultimately, the Wolverines pulled
out the victory against the talent-
ed and underrated Gamecocks.
"I'm glad Friday's match wasn't
very competitive, because we had
more time to recover," Sulahian
said.
Sunday's three doubles matches
went down to the wire, but the
Wolverines squeezed out the point
behind a clutch performance by
the No. 1 doubles team of senior
Chisako Sugiyama and junior
Tania Mahtani. Both exploited
South Carolina's weak second
serves.
After a Gamecocks' shot was
called wide, the match was thought
to be over and the Wolverines team
ran to the net to shake hands with
their opponents. But the Game-

cocks refused to budge, claiming
the ball had clipped the back part
of the line. After the umpire reaf-
firmed that the ball was indeed
wide, South Carolina hesitantly
approached the net and the 8-6
victory was confirmed.
The No. 2 doubles team of soph-
omores Whitney Taney and Rika
Tatsuano also helped the cause by
winning their match 8-5.
Playing at No. 1 singles, Sugi-
yama was upset in straight sets
and appeared both tired and frus-
trated.
At No. 2 singles, Tatsuano
struggled to get her first serve m
with regularity and lost in straight
sets to Ana Marija Zubori. Zubori,
whoultimately won the match in
straight sets (6-3, 6-4), attacked
Tatsuano's second serve and threw
in a bevy of trick shots that frus-
trated Tatsuano and forced her to
change her gameplan.
But it was Sulahian's perfor-
mance that clinched the win event
after her disappointing doubles
outing.
Sulahian, who had lost for the
second time that weekend in her
No. 3 doubles match with How-
ard, appeared to relish all of the
pressure and the emotions of the
crowd.
"After the doubles, me and Lind-
say just wanted to get the perfor-
mance out of our head." Sulahian
said.

Blue needs more
from its best

John Beilein says he's not
bothered by it. Manny Har-
ris says he's not getting frus-
trated. In fact, the whole Michigan
men's basketball team doesn't seem
to be paying it any attention.
But "Manny Fresh," the Wolver-
ines' sure-thing scorer, has gone
stale recently. Harris has just 12
points in the last two games on
3-of-19 shooting. He hasn't made a
3-pointer in more than 80 minutes.
Harris is a
great player -
he scored in
double figures in
every game this
season before
last week's Penn.
State debacle,
but he needs ANDY
to shake this REID
slump immedi-
ately if the Wol-
verines are going to make a push for
an NCAA Tournament bid.
In the locker room after Michi-
gan's 68-59 win against North-
western, Harris wasn't upset about
his eight points, saying that if his
shots aren't falling, he can contrib-
ute in other ways. And he did, dish-
ing out four assists and grabbing 12
rebounds.
Sure, Harris's newfound versa-
tility is a major reason for the Wol-
verines' drastic turnaround this
year. Sure, he was getting double-
teamed most of the night. Sure,
open shot opportunities are few and
far between for the Big Ten's No. 2
scorer.
But Harris didn't take advantage
of the chances he got, rimming out

shots and not finishing on lay-ups.
Even though he is on track to dou-
ble his assists total from last year,
Michigan is notgoing to thrive until
he finds his shot again.
"I'm not worried about mine,"
Harris said. " I'll get mine eventu-
ally. Just doing other things, get a
couple assists, rebounding. The key
is that we won."
But how long can the Wolverines
keep winningif Harris doesn't come
out of this scoring slump?
Before Saturday, no Michigan
fan could have possibly imagined a
scenario in which Harris notched
10-plus boards and didn't register
a double-double. Even if Harris is
gutting out the tough plays, hus-
tling on the court and helping his
teammates, there's been a giant hole
in Michigan's offense when he's not
scoring. His 351 points on the year
make up a quarter of the Wolver-
ines' total offensive output.
It doesn't stop with Harris, either.
Junior DeShawn Sims, who needs to
shore up the paint if the Wolverines
are to find success, has struggled to
uphold that responsibility lately.
When he scored the Wolver-
ines' first nine points on Saturday,
I thought Sims was finally adapting
to the role of Michigan's post pres-
ence. He tallied just one more field
goal in the game's final 37 minutes.
It's no secret that Beilein's squad
is in desperate need of a post game.
Sims can't be held quiet for so long
against one of the smallest teams in
the Big Ten. If lowly Northwestern
can keep Sims's post-play in check,
what will seven-footer B.J. Mullens
and Dallas Lauderdale of Ohio State

WILDCATS
From page 1B
Lucas-Perry, who made his first
3-pointer in three games. "We
played aggressive. We played
with poise."
With the win, Beilein earned
his 500th-career victory as a
head coach at a four-year school.
And .it took a complete effort
from his team to do it.
Nine players scored for the
Wolverines and six finished with
eight or more points.
Junior forward DeShawn
Sims scored Michigan's first nine
points in the game's first three
minutes.
But Sims cooled off and relied
on his teammates to lead Michi-
gan (4-4 Big Ten, 14-6 overall) to
its first win in four games. He fin-
ished with a team-high 15 points
and seven rebounds.
"He played like a beast," Lucas-
Perry said of Sims. "He played
with that tenacity that we need
out of him every game."
The Wildcats (2-5, 10-7)
entered Crisler Arena fresh off
their stunning 70-63 upset of No.
7 Michigan State last Wednesday
in East Lansing.
But Northwestern couldn't
muster the same lights-out
shooting and had just three play-
ers account for 83 percent of its
offense.
But while the Wildcats relied
on their top three scorers, Michi-
gan's leading offensive presence,
sophomore forward Manny Har-
ris, remained on a skid.
With just eight points on Sat-
urday, Harris has scored a com-
bined 12 points inthe Wolverines'
last two games.
But even when the Big Ten's
second-leading scorer (17.6
points per game) was double-
teamed, Harris was a major con-

tributor in Michigan's win with
a game-high 12 rebounds and
four assists.
"The key thing is winning,"
Harris said. "I've had 20-some
and we lost. It will come ... I'll get
mine back."
The Wolverines have played
well at home this year, and from
tipoff, the players' intensity was
palpable.
Whether it was Sims, Harris or
fifth-year senior guard C.J. Lee
diving for a rebound, Michigan
played with a poised urgency that
had been absent in recent games.
The Wolverines outrebound-
ed Northwestern 41-22 and had
an impressive 18-to-9 assist-to-
turnover ratio.
Freshman guard Zack Novak
was crucial to Michigan's attack
on the glass, grabbingthree offen-
sive and seven total rebounds.
At just 6-foot-5, Novak is often
outsized in the post, but his inten-
sity gives him an advantage.
"That was big -he's just exact-
ly what the doctor ordered, as far
as just a guy that is a nuts-and-
bolts, blue-collar, lunch-bucket,
whatever you guys want to call
him," Beilein said. "He does a lot
of the garbage stuff we need to
get done."
The patience the Wolverines
exhibited Saturday was a stark
contrast to last Tuesday's loss at
Penn State when Michigan shot
under 17 percent from 3-point
range.
- It was a big move for Michi-
gan to regain its confidence when
Northwestern was brimming
with it.
"That was probably the most
disappointing thing about the
three losses - we thought we
left something on the court," Lee
said.
"Tonight, we wanted to empty
out everyone's tank and go hard
the entire time."

One lane. Sixty-meters. Five
hurdles.
Seven and one half seconds later,
Senior Tiffany Ofili took a first-
place finish in the 60-meter hurdles
and an NCAA automatic-qualifying
mark for the second week in a row.
"I try to just drown everything
out," Ofili said. "Nothing else mat-
ters besides the five hurtles and the
finish line in front of me."
The co-captain also won the
60-meter dash and came in second
behind teammate Bettie Wade in
the long jump, leaping 20 feet and
7 inches at the non-scoring Sim-
mons/Harvey Invitational at the
Indoor Track Building Saturday.
Ofili took a noticeable lead right
out of the startingblocks in both the
60-meter hurdles and the 60-meter
dash. By the time her opponents
prepared to clear their first hurdle,
Ofiliwas a step ahead of the next.
Co-captains Casey Taylor and
Wade joined in Ofili's success. The
Wolverines earned seven first-place
finishes, five earned by the three
captains Taylor, Wade and Ofili.
Saturday's meet was one of the
few opportunities for the Wolver-
ines to get fast times before the Big

Senior Tiffany Ofili had two first-place fini
Ten Championships at the end of
February.
Taylor set a school record and
new personal best in the triple
jump (13.09 meters) Saturday, beat-
ing the personal best she set last
week in Akron.
"I was happy, but I had other
goals in mind," Taylor said. "I
stayed calm and collected just so
I could get myself together for the
rest of the jumps."
Wade followed with an equally
impressive performance when she
met the NCAA automatic-qualify-
ing mark with her 20-feet-and-10-
inch long jump, a personal best and
a jump good enough for first place.
"I get really hyped when things

shes at the Simmons/Harvey Invitational
go well," Wade said. "So I was just
really excited. And thes nay other
teammates, we all get really com-
petitive and talk smack to each
other so I was like 'lets go!"'
The Wolverines have just five
meets to earn qualifying times for
the NCAA Championships prior
to the indoor Big Tens. Michigan
coach James Henry said he was
impressed with his athletes perfor-
mance in only the third meet of the
season.
"I was really excited, reallyhappy
with the results," Michigan coach
James Henry said. "They looked
like if they continue to improve that
we are going to have a very special
team and a very special year."

A quick stumble as he left the
blocks wasn't enough to keep
senior All-America sprinter Alam
Harris from finishing first.
Harris took the 60-meter dash
in just 6.71 seconds and picked
sip an NCAA provisional mark,
leading from start to finish in Sat-
urday's non-scoring Simmons/
Harvey Invitational at the 'ndoor

"What I was really happy about

"I like him. I think he's straight

The two national-caliber run-

were Eastern Michigan's Clint
Allen and Johnny Drake, who ran
unattached. Allen is the defending
Mid-American Conference cham-
pion, and LaIlante says Drake once
held the world's top time when he
attended Central Michigan.
Harris said this wasn't the first
time they'd all faced off.
"They're pretty good friends

camaraderie thing going," Harris
said. "I'm used to racing them. I
knew it was going to be good com-

tured teams including Valparaiso,
Central Michigan and South Flori-
da among others.
Harris' performance was partof
four first-place finishes on the day
for the 17th-ranked Wolverines.
Junior Matt Wheeler won
the 400-meter dash, sophomore

Carl Buchanon placed first in the
60-meter hurdles and redshirt
junior thrower Sean Pruitt won
the shot put.
Buchanon, who finished sec-
ond in hurdles at "The Dual" last
week, said he attributed his suc-
cess to three factors: composure,
maintaining speed between the
hurdles and keeping the correct
technique.
"When I was practicing before,
it all kind of came together," Buch-
anon said. "I was like, 'I hope I can
get this through the finals,' and
everything just clicked."
Though the meet doesn't count
in the standings, LaPlante said the
team's performance in the non-
scoringmeet reflected the Wolver-
ines' good preparation.
"This is the kind of meet, non-
scoring, after a disappointment,
guys did a nice job of competing,"
LaPlante said. "I was really happy
with the guys that ran the 400, the
way they ran the race ... For this
type of meet, it was perfect for us."
