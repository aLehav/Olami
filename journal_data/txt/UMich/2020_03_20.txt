A cook in the dining hall of 

East Quad Residence Hall at 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

has 
tested 
positive 
for 
the 

novel 
coronavirus 
(COVID-

19), according to an email sent 

by Alasia Tardy, East Quad 

MDining assistant manager, to 

employees of East Quad’s Blue 

Café.

“The rumors are true … a cook 

in EQ tested positive for the 

virus,” Tardy wrote.

The email does not specify the 

risk of exposure for students who 

have eaten recently at the dining 

hall or for those who work in 

MDining. It is unclear whether 

East Quad will require students 

to move out of its residence halls.

The University’s Office of 

Public Affairs gave The Daily a 

statement from MDining shared 

with those that visited East 

Quad’s dining hall. According 

to the statement, the individual 

who tested positive for COVID-

19 “had access to East Quad 

dining” and is now self-isolating 

at home.

“Effective 
immediately, 
we 

will be closing the East Quad 

dining facility for four days in 

order to clean and disinfect the 

unit,” the statement reads. “We 

are working in partnership with 

public health officials to notify 

any individuals who may have 

been exposed directly. Anyone 

who has recently visited the East 

Quad dining facility should self-

monitor for symptoms of fever, 

cough or difficulty breathing.”

When 
contacted, 
Tardy 

directed The Daily to MDining 

marketing 
manager 
Kelly 

Guralewski, who deferred to 

Public Affairs. 

An “operational update” on 

MDining’s East Quad website 

says East Quad Dining Hall is 

temporarily 
closed. 
Students 

usually eating at East Quad can 

pick up their takeout meals from 

South Quad Residence Hall’s 

dining hall instead. 

Multiple universities — including 

Middlebury 
College, 
Georgetown 

University and the Massachusetts 

Institute of Technology — have 

announced plans to offer a passing 

or not passing grading system for 

all courses this semester. These 

decisions 
have 
made 
University 

of Michigan students and faculty 

question whether the University will 

follow suit. No official decision has 

been made yet.

Like these schools, the University 

moved all classes to a remote teaching 

format in order to allow students to 

practice social distancing and healthy 

habits amid an outbreak of COVID-

19. The University has encouraged all 

students who are able to leave campus 

and return to their permanent 

residence.

In announcing the changes, leaders 

at these colleges have attributed 

the change in grading as a way to 

quell fears about the global health 

pandemic and ease concerns over how 

students’ grades will be impacted by 

the move to online learning.

In an email to Ford School 

of Public Policy students, Paula 

Lantz, associate dean for academic 

affairs, wrote deans from across the 

University are considering a grading 

system in which students will either 

receive a Pass or a No Record. A “No 

Record” is different from a “Fail” 

in that a traditionally non-passing 

grade will not show up on a student’s 

transcript instead of being listed as a 

failed course.

In addition to this, she noted there 

is also the potential to “unmask” 

grades, meaning that a letter grade 

for a course would show up on a 

student’s transcript in addition to 

the “Pass.” Lantz noted this policy, 

which has been adopted by other 

institutions, is being considered by 

the University.

University 
spokesperson 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said in an email while 

the suggestion to move to Pass/

Fail classes has been brought up, no 

decision has been reached. 

“The Office of the Provost is 

carefully exploring this suggestion,” 

Fitzgerald wrote. “There has been 

no decision.”

As of Thursday afternoon, LSA 

and the College of Engineering have 

both announced extensions to their 

late add-drop deadlines.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

With 
many 
University 
of 

Michigan students off-campus 

due to fears about the spread 

of 
coronavirus, 
candidates 

running in the Central Student 

Government 
election 
next 

week have based their efforts to 

connect with voters on online 

platforms. 

Following the outbreak of the 

virus in Michigan, the University 

moved classes and finals online 

while President Mark Schlissel 

encouraged all students to return 

to their permanent residences.

In the current University 

policy, students may take 

up to 30 credits in the 

Pass/Fail grading system, 

with 
some 
exceptions 

for major or distribution 

requirements. A common 

example 
of 
a 
course 

that 
cannot 
be 
taken 

Pass/Fail is the fourth-

semester foreign language 

requirement, which LSA 

students must take for a 

grade to graduate.

Students 
have 
raised 

questions whether certain 

courses requiring letter 

grades will be waived for 

this semester should a 

University-wide policy be 

put into place.

Currently, 
any 
grade 

of C- or above is listed on 

transcripts as a “Pass,” 

while any grade below is 

a “Fail.” Courses taken 

within 
the 
University’s 

current Pass/Fail grading 

system does not affect a 

student’s 
grade-point-

average. 
The 
Pass/Fail 

deadline 
for 
Winter 

semester has passed.

Students have displayed 

mixed reactions to the 

possibility 
of 
moving 

away from a letter grading 

system.

A Change.org petition 

that has amassed more than 

4,500 signatures in six days 

has called on the University 

to offer the option for 

students to elect to take 

courses under the Pass/Fail 

grading system. The petition 

listed the large-scale impact 

of the virus, difficulty of 

remote learning, disruption 

of 
current 
on-campus 

resources and the potential 

for cheating as reasons why 

the University should adopt 

this policy.

LSA 
freshman 
Steven 

Tuckel said he likes the 

idea of moving all classes 

to this grading system, but 

expressed concern for how 

it could impact students 

when applying to upper-

level programs or graduate 

school.

News
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The 
Washtenaw 

County 
Health 

Department 
released 

a 
statement 
noting 

“community 
spread 

is 
likely” 
as 
seven 

additional people have 

tested 
positive 
for 

COVID-19.

As of 10 a.m. Thursday 

morning, 
14 
people 

within 
the 
county 

have 
tested 
positive 

for coronavirus, a viral 

infection 
discovered 

in Wuhan, China that 

has infected more than 

218,000 people globally.

According 
to 
the 

Health 
Department’s 

website, 
the 
majority 

of the seven new cases 

had 
no 
recent 
travel 

or known contact with 

other confirmed cases of 

COVID-19. The website 

noted 
the 
department 

is working with these 

people — who are all 

adults — to alert close 

contacts to quarantine.

“Evidence 
of 

community spread means 

we will change how we 

respond to local cases, 

especially as the number 

of tests increases every 

day,” Jimena Loveluck, 

health 
officer 
of 
the 

Health Department, said 

in 
the 
announcement. 

“But, we must remember 

this 
is 
exactly 
why 

we 
have 
community 

mitigation 
strategies 

and 
unprecedented 

restrictions 
in 
place. 

Our 
collective 
goal 

remains 
to 
slow 
the 

spread of cases as much 

as possible. Together, we 

can do this. Take every 

possible opportunity to 

practice prevention and 

social distancing.”

Because 
of 
the 

expected 
community 

spread, the county will 

no longer name low-

risk exposure areas and 

residents should assume 

there is a risk associated 

with any public location.

While health experts 

are 
still 
investigating 

how the disease is spread, 

the Centers for Disease 

Control and Prevention 

recommends 
people 

maintain 
at 
least 
six 

feet between themselves 

and 
others. 
People 

showing 
symptoms 

are encouraged to seek 

medical help.

“Assume 
the 

possibility for infection 

exists, 
as 
it 
does 

with 
many 
common 

illnesses. Most people 

will recover at home 

without medical care,” 

Juan 
Luis 
Marquez, 

Washtenaw 
County 

Health 
Department 

medical 
director, 
said 

in 
the 
announcement. 

“Isolating 
at 
home 

if 
you’re 
sick 
and 

contacting your health 

care provider by phone 

for guidance will help 

prevent 
additional 

spread and make the best 

possible use of critical 

health care resources.”

Washtenaw 
County 

has 
approximately 

370,000 residents and is 

home to the University 

of Michigan and Eastern 

Michigan University.

Multiple Ann Arbor-

run 
buildings 
and 

services have been closed 

as 
Mayor 
Christopher 

Taylor declared a local 

state of emergency. Ann 

Arbor Public Schools are 

closed until at least April 

5.

As of Wednesday, 80 

cases have been reported 

in the state of Michigan. 

The first death in the 

state was also confirmed 

Wednesday at Beaumont 

Hospital 
in 
Wayne 

County.

In response to the 

virus, 
the 
University 

moved all classes to an 

online format beginning 

Monday. Students who 

are able to have been 

asked to leave campus.

Among the 14 cases in 

Washtenaw County, two 

have 
been 
confirmed 

at 
student 
apartment 

buildings 
Vic 
Village-

North 
and 
ArborBLU. 

Another 
person 
who 

tested 
positive 
works 

as a cook in East Quad 

Residence Hall.

Number of cases doubles to reach total of 14; Washtenaw officials

All dining halls began 

serving 
takeout 
meals 

only on Monday night. On 

Tuesday morning, students 

were told they must leave 

the residence halls unless 

they fill out a petition 

to stay by Wednesday 8 

a.m., causing widespread 

confusion and stress as 

many rearranged move-out 

plans at the last minute. 

In the email sent by 

University 
Housing 
on 

Tuesday, students were told 

the push to leave campus 

was made necessary by the 

rapidly evolving situation.

“New developments in 

the 
COVID-19 
pandemic 

make it clear that now is 

the time to return home,” 

the email reads. “...While 

University 
Housing 
will 

ensure 
that 
we 
have 

sufficient housing available 

for 
students 
who 
truly 

have no other alternatives, 

we cannot promise that 

you will be able to remain 

in your current housing 

assignment.”

There 
are 
currently 

14 
confirmed 
cases 
in 

Washtenaw 
County. 
The 

University 
moved 
all 

classes online on March 11, 

the day after Gov. Gretchen 

Whitmer 
announced 
the 

first two cases in Michigan. 

Three people in Michigan 

have died from coronavirus, 

the first a man in his 50’s 

who died on Wednesday 

morning.

Cases of COVID-19 have 

also been confirmed in 

two 
student 
apartment 

buildings Vic Village and 

ArborBLU. 

The Centers for Disease 

Control 
and 
Prevention 

recommends people wash 

their hands often and avoid 

touching their eyes, nose 

and mouth. People are also 

encouraged 
to 
practice 

social 
distancing, 
or 
to 

avoid unnecessary social 

interaction, and to maintain 

a six-foot distance between 

one another. The White 

House and CDC recommend 

social gatherings of less 

than 10 people.

In 
an 
email 
to 
The 

Daily, 
Susan 
Ringler-

Cerniglia, 
Washtenaw 

County Health Department 

communications and health 

promotion 
administrator, 

emphasized the importance 

of 
social 
distancing 

and 
other 
preventative 

measures.

“Good 
adherence 

to 
the 
community 

mitigation 
orders 
and 

recommendations is critical 

to 
slowing 
the 
spread 

of 
illness 
– 
and 
much 

less 
about 
any 
specific 

or 
identified 
locations,” 

Ringler-Cerniglia 
wrote. 

“We 
all 
need 
to 
take 

precautions 
and 
assume 

the possibility of lower-

risk community exposures 

when we are out.”

Symptoms of coronavirus 

include fever, cough and 

shortness of breath. Anyone 

who believes they have 

been exposed to COVID-19 

should call their primary 

care physician. Individuals 

can also contact their local 

health department, which 

in Washtenaw County can 

be reached at 734-544-

6700.

DINING
From Page 1

This forced the campaigns 

seeking to win seats in next 

week’s 
CSG 
election 
— 

which traditionally brings 

campaigners to the Diag 

and posters plastered on 

campus walls — to adjust 

their outreach strategies.

Several candidates told 

The Daily that the shift to 

students going off-campus 

has affected the upcoming 

elections as they are unable 

to spread the word about 

the 
elections 
through 

campaigning on campus. 

Campaigning online, they 

said, can also be difficult 

since parties cannot send 

emails on listservs — a rule 

written into the election 

code.

Members of the three 

parties campaigning in next 

week’s election said they 

are now reliant on social 

media platforms to reach 

out to students and have 

their messages heard. 

Rackham 
student 

Austin Glass, Change At 

Michigan’s 
presidential 

candidate, said that while 

the party is still reaching 

out to voters through social 

media, the executive ticket 

has decided to suspend the 

party’s broader campaign 

activities in light of COVID-

19 and limit campaigning to 

friends and those they had 

already been in touch with 

previously. 

“Ultimately, we made the 

executive decision at the 

top of the ticket to put off 

campaign efforts other than 

those with people who had 

already reached out to us 

and to whom we had already 

reached out just to try and 

give people their space,” 

Glass said. “Obviously, this 

has been a huge disruption 

on all of our lives. We’ve 

tried to make sure that 

the folks involved in the 

campaign don’t feel like 

CSG elections are one more 

thing that they have got to 

worry about.”

Glass said Change At 

Michigan’s 
campaign 

strategy 
would 
rely 
on 

social 
networks 
like 

Facebook, 
sending 
texts 

to friends and group chats 

— platforms that, unlike 

emails, are not restricted by 

the election code. 

“The biggest challenge 

that we face is connecting 

with 
students 
we 
don’t 

already know,” Glass said. 

“We can’t just go out and 

stand on the Diag, we can’t 

post flyers in buildings 

that students are walking 

though because they are 

not walking through those 

buildings anymore.”

Public 
Policy 
junior 

Amanda Kaplan, Mobilize’s 

presidential 
candidate, 

said 
the 
suspension 
of 

in-person classes will not 

significantly impact their 

campaign strategy. Kaplan 

said 
most 
of 
Mobilize’s 

campaigning 
has 
been 

through social media, as 

it helped their campaign 

avoid using paper on flyers 

and posters and was in line 

with their emphasis on 

sustainability.

“Usually 
people 
use 

flyers, 
and 
that 
was 
a 

commitment that Sav and 

I made at the beginning — 

that we weren’t going to 

print any flyers even if we 

were on campus because we 

wanted to be paper-free,” 

Kaplan said. “We have been 

focusing on social media 

and using networks, so I 

think for (Mobilize), it’s 

just making sure that those 

networks are being used up 

to their potential so that 

as many students can be 

engaged as possible in the 

process.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Sam 

Braden, who is running 

for 
re-election 
as 
an 

LSA 
representative 
with 

Represent Michigan, also 

said the move to online 

classes will not affect his 

party’s campaign strategy 

much.

“Oftentimes, 
people 

haven’t really put a lot of 

effort into (platforms) as 

they focus on telling people 

to vote for them,” Braden 

said. “Represent Michigan 

started with coming up 

with a comprehensive good 

platform. A lot of our focus 

has been just to make the 

platforms high quality.”

Kaplan also emphasized 

how important each student 

vote is now that there 

has been an outbreak of 

COVID-19 on campus and 

the University is grappling 

with its effects.

“As students are being 

worried about what the 

future of the University 

is going to look like and 

what is the purpose of CSG 

elections in the midst of all 

this craziness, I think it’s 

important to ground people 

and recognize that this vote 

is now more important than 

ever because these (elected 

representatives) are going 

to be leading the University 

through such a tumultuous 

time in confronting the 

effects 
of 
COVID-19 

now and throughout the 

following 
year,” 
Kaplan 

said.

LSA 
junior 
Mary 

McKillop, CSG’s elections 

director and LSA Student 

Government vice president, 

said the elections team 

was working hard to reach 

out to students through 

online 
resources, 
such 

as Canvas and Facebook, 

to keep voter turnout up. 

McKillop 
also 
said 
the 

team 
planned 
on 
using 

the 
previously 
allocated 

$500 for campaigning on 

targeted 
advertising 
on 

CSG’s Facebook account.

“On the one hand, I 

would really appreciate 

getting a bit of a break 

because 
it 
has 
been 

stressful having to leave 

suddenly 
and 
in 
the 

middle of classes,” Tuckel 

said. “But I’m thinking 

about applying to Ford 

and grad school and I’m 

very worried … that if I 

come into that with a ‘P’ 

and I’m applying against 

someone 
that 
has 
an 

‘A’ that I’m going to be 

looked down upon for 

that.”

LSA 
freshman 

Dominic 
Coletti 
was 

also concerned about the 

impact of Pass/Fail on his 

future plans. According 

to 
the 
LSA 
Newnan 

Advising Center, courses 

for majors and minors 

cannot be taken Pass/

Fail. Currently, Coletti 

said he was taking a lot 

of 
major 
prerequisite 

classes and is concerned 

Pass/Fail would not be 

beneficial in his case. 

“If majors don’t change 

their policies on that, 

this semester is kind of 

a (loss) for me because 

I have to take all these 

classes again on a graded 

basis,” Coletti said. “If the 

University can negotiate 

a way for these courses to 

still count under a Pass/

Fail system, I think Pass/

Fail would be a really 

good option that would 

help me, as well as other 

people, to alleviate a lot 

of the stresses that come 

with this really uncertain 

time.”

Coletti 
noted 
the 

Pass/Fail option would 

be beneficial not only 

because students do not 

have access to the same 

resources they normally 

have, but also because the 

option would help level 

the disparities between 

the way professors are 

adjusting their classes.

“While some professors 

are making changes to 

their 
grading 
system, 

some 
really 
haven’t 

changed 
their 
classes 

all 
that 
much 
from 

when we were meeting 

in-person,” Coletti said. 

“They 
haven’t 
really 

accommodated students, 

and so for the University 

to change the grading 

basis would really help 

students who are feeling 

pressure 
from 
those 

classes to feel better and 

learn the best they can 

while not being punished 

for not having access to 

resources.”

Regarding 
students 

still on campus, Coletti 

believes making classes 

Pass/Fail 
could 
help 

alleviate 
the 
stress 

as 
a 
result 
of 
the 

developments of COVID-

19. On Tuesday morning, 

an email to dining hall 

staff confirmed that a 

cook at East Quad tested 

positive for the virus.

“I 
still 
live 
in 

on-campus housing and 

one of the things with 

that is that it’s a situation 

that changes every single 

day,” Coletti said. “I don’t 

think I’ve gone a full day 

of just being able to focus 

on class because I (get) a 

new email from housing, 

or a new email from 

dining explaining really 

broad, sweeping changes 

to my living situation.”

LSA 
sophomore 

Alexandra Windle, who 

signed the petition to 

move classes to a Pass/

Fail grading system, said 

she hoped the University 

would move to a Pass/

Fail system in order to 

accommodate 
students 

who are still adapting to 

the rigor of University 

classes. 
Windle 
said 

that 
because 
this 
is 

her 
first 
semester 
at 

the University, she has 

had to adapt to both an 

unfamiliar campus and 

now a new teaching style.

“My perspective as a 

nontraditional 
student 

is something that the 

University doesn’t really 

take 
into 
account,” 

Windle said. “For me 

personally, 
it’s 
been 

spending so much time 

getting to the University 

through my community 

college and making sure 

that I’m a good applicant 

for transferring. And now 

I feel like the University 

has kind of abandoned 

us.”

Windle 
said 
as 
a 

nontraditional 
student 

who 
transferred 
from 

a 
smaller 
community 

college 
this 
semester, 

moving 
to 
Pass/Fail 

would allow her to better 

acclimate to University 

classes while taking them 

online. 

“It seemed like every 

week 
I 
was 
learning 

something new, I was 

switching 
something 

up in my schedule. I 

was never on a routine 

because I’m trying to 

catch up with everyone 

that’s been here since 

they’ve been a freshman,” 

Windle said. “I feel like 

I was kind of hit with a 

curveball trying to learn 

this material and trying 

to be a student just in 

general. So I was starting 

to get the hang of things 

and now I feel like I’ve 

been knocked down a peg 

and I’m being switched to 

this style of learning that 

I’ve never done before.”

Engineering 
senior 

Howard Zhang said he 

understood why a Pass/

Fail system would be a 

good option for many 

students, but said that 

for others trying to raise 

their GPA, it could be 

harmful. Zhang said he 

needs a certain GPA to 

accept a job offer for next 

year and is very close to 

reaching it. However, he 

noted he may not be able 

to accept the offer if he is 

forced to make all of his 

classes Pass/Fail.

“If 
the 
University 

makes pass/fail not an 

option, 
but 
rather 
it 

forces this pass/fail onto 

everybody, then I’m not 

going to be able to take 

this job anymore because 

I wouldn’t be able to boost 

my GPA,” Zhang said. “I 

don’t think I’m the only 

one in this situation, in 

fact I’ve talked to other 

students who had rough 

times in the past couple 

of years … a lot of students 

try their best to work 

harder, try their best to 

turn their GPA around. 

… This just makes it so 

that students don’t have 

the option to do that this 

semester.”

GRADING
From Page 2


E 

veryone treats it like a 

death 
sentence, 
even 

when it’s just a cough. 

Stores close their doors, people 

keep their distance. Most infected 

people don’t know they have it, so it 

spreads uncontrollably, eager to kill 

the moment it finds a compromised 

immune system. It’s not coronavirus, 

it’s HIV.

The media, medical experts 

and politicians alike have shown 

us time and time again the federal 

government’s response to COVID-19 

has been unsatisfactory for a virus 

of its scope. Americans expect our 

government to take proper action to 

protect us — as they should. Rewind 

four decades or so, though, and you’ll 

find that most people didn’t mind the 

radio silence.

The first reported cases of HIV 

in the United States were in 1981 

(though an unknown number of cases 

existed before the turn of the decade), 

kickstarting 
the 
nightmarish 
epidemic. 

In just its first year, HIV infected 270 

people and killed 121. Despite the 

numbers and despite being more or 

less equally fatal among everyone 

— it is not the virus itself that kills 

but the deterioration of the immune 

system, thereby leaving everyone 

equally vulnerable. The death toll 

continued to rise before peaking in 

1995 
with 
around 
50,000 
deaths. 
Even 

today, HIV kills thousands; in 2016, it 

was the ninth-largest cause of death 

for Americans aged 25 to 44, killing 

more than 6,000 people. Despite this, 

modern America seems to treat HIV 

like it isn’t severe, even though the 

disease is called an epidemic by the 

United Nations, something that likely 

won’t 
change 
until 
2030, 
at 
the 
earliest.

How could a disease stay this 

deadly for so long in a nation as rich 

and powerful as the U.S.? Simply put, 

our government allowed it to.

At the outbreak of the epidemic, 

it was impossible not to notice that 

almost everyone with HIV was a gay 

man. It was so apparent that the virus 

was originally labeled GRID, gay-

related immune deficiency, by the 

medical establishment (though this 

often goes unacknowledged because 

it subtly supports the rhetoric that 

HIV is “God’s punishment” for being 

gay) and the “gay plague” by the 

general public. It wasn’t until 1983, 

when women were diagnosed with 

it, that anyone thought it could be 

transmitted heterosexually, but this 

knowledge went under the radar 

because those cases were vastly 

outnumbered by those of gay men.

Because it was a “gay plague,” 

the government treated it as such. 

Homophobia became increasingly 

intertwined 
with 
public 
policy 

during the election of Ronald Reagan, 

putting an end to the post-Stonewall 

surge in LGBTQ+ civil rights. In 1982, 

Reagan’s press secretary (and others 

in the room) openly laughed when 

asked whether the White House 

was monitoring the disease, saying, 

“I don’t have it, do you?” That year, 

the death toll would reach 618, a five-

fold increase from the 121 deaths the 

previous year. In 1984, Health and 

Human Services officially discovered 

the virus and promised a vaccine by 

1986; the vaccine still doesn’t exist 

despite successful proof-of-concept. 

A year later, Reagan finally said the 

word “AIDS” in public — by this time 

the death toll had surpassed 12,000.

If not for the work of gay activists, 

even less action would have been 

taken. Community leaders formed 

health centers like the Gay Men’s 

Health Crisis and promoted safe 

sex (a practice that even the medical 

community was not yet teaching) 

as early as 1982. Gay establishments 

closed themselves to slow the spread. 

As AIDS prevention campaigns 

grew, the government suppressed 

them. In 1987, Reagan signed into 

law a ban on the use of federal funds 

for AIDS prevention and education 

programs that “promoted” (that is to 

say, acknowledged) homosexuality. 

Campaigns that were eligible for 

funding 
disingenuously 
claimed 

that everyone was at risk, siphoning 

resources away from the masses 

of dying gay men and toward the 

few 
heterosexual 
HIV-positive 

people. In theory, this campaign 

could 
have 
destigmatized 
the 

virus and fought the “gay plague” 

reputation, but in practice, it did the 

opposite, as gay men grew even more 

disproportionately affected once 

resources were diverted into other 

communities.

Finally, we come to coronavirus, 

and the parallels are frightening. The 

response of our current president 

isn’t much better than Reagan’s 

was. He claims that “the risk to the 

American people remains very low.” 

Declaring coronavirus as not an 

“American” disease but a “Chinese 

virus” echoes the rhetoric about HIV 

being a “gay” disease and displays 

xenophobia. 
President 
Donald 

Trump has put Vice President Mike 

Pence in charge of handling 

the disease, a man who actively 

worsened Indiana’s HIV outbreak 

as governor by preventing needle 

exchange programs (even his own 

party supported them) and cutting 

funding for Planned Parenthood, the 

only clinic offering HIV tests in the 

affected area. Even in the ’80s and 

’90s, AIDS activists were protesting 

the inaction of a certain New York 

City mayor named Rudy Giuliani — 

now the President’s attorney. Those 

running our government have long 

since proven that they cannot, or will 

not, properly handle an epidemic, let 

alone a pandemic.

However, just as the public was 

partially 
at 
fault 
with 
HIV, 
our 
approach 

to the coronavirus reflects the 

shortcomings 
present 
during 
the 
AIDS 

epidemic. 
Like 
HIV, 
COVID-19 
does 
not 

affect 
everyone 
equally; 
the 
elderly 
are 

at much higher risk for severe or fatal 

cases. 
The 
rush 
to 
close 
establishments 

has prioritized schools and colleges 

— in Michigan, every K-12 school is 

closed until April 5 — despite the 0.2 

percent fatality rate for college-age 

people, and those under the age of 

nine 
not 
having 
any 
recorded 
fatalities. 

Closing nursing homes has been 

discussed less frequently despite the 

much greater risk residents face. The 

repeated failure of most U.S. nursing 

homes to control previous infections 

is being all but ignored — less than 

10 percent of infection prevention 

specialists in American nursing 

homes have any sort of training or 

certification. Although quarantining 

youth is effective at preventing young 

carriers from potentially spreading 

it to the elderly, we know a certain 

demographic is at heightened risk but 

fail to focus our resources on helping 

those 
groups, 
favoring 
an 
“everyone 
at 

risk” narrative.

Our 
country’s 
response 
to 

coronavirus is failing. Most know 

this because they are being told so on 

the news, but gay Americans know 

it from lived experience. And yet, 

we are making the same mistakes 

and giving those who failed us 40 

years ago the power to fail us again. 

This has already had a hefty human 

price tag. During its first year, 121 

people died of HIV in America; 

it is mid-March, and COVID-19 

has killed at least 108 Americans. 

That number will only rise until we 

learn to acknowledge what we have 

done and continue to do wrong: 

F

or as long as I can remember, the 

western basin of Lake Erie has 

become coated with slick, green 

slime at the end of each summer. As one of 

the Great Lakes, Lake Erie experiences a 

sudden increase in microbial life that festers 

into coats of toxic algae that can span over 

620 square miles on its surface. Although a 

phenomenon of natural contamination, these 

algal blooms occur mainly due to increased 

agricultural runoff made possible by no-till 

farming. 

In a recent paper, Dr. Jennifer Blesh, 

an assistant professor at the University 

of Michigan, addressed the relationships 

between agricultural practices and water 

quality downstream in the Lake Erie basin. 

She and her colleagues explain that soil 

health assessments in agriculture are critical 

for improving water quality because soil 

properties influence water filtration and 

nutrient availability, both of which contribute 

to overall soil function. Given that there are 

methods to assess soil health’s impact on 

water quality in smaller water entities, the 

University should dedicate more research 

toward developing reproducible soil health 

indicators that can be implemented to a 

regional extent.

As of now, research teams like Blesh’s 

utilize regulated modeling to no avail: The 

models are insufficient and inconsistent 

among ecosystems across the basin. Blesh 

and her team detail the faults of the current 

modeling systems: “Most modeling studies 

in the Lake Erie region were validated with 

limited field observations, consider a limited 

range of best management practices and lack 

data linking different management strategies 

to changes in soil health.” This type of 

modeling highlights specific issues that can 

be solved with efforts by large academic 

institutions, an endeavor that the University 

should pursue to improve the effectiveness of 

the tools used by teams in this important field 

research. Furthermore, it’s worth detailing 

these specific issues in order to indicate 

what the University could resolve with more 

allocated resources. 

These models pose issues because they 

lack the detailed simulation and visualization 

of biological processes important to soil 

function, such as microbial community 

makeup and diversity. They are restricted 

because they only evaluate biological 

processes of interest on topsoil, leaving the 

subsoil unevaluated even though these 

same processes occur there. Additionally, 

these models are insufficient because they 

include oversimplified representations of 

macropore flow that are easily manipulated 

by agricultural practices when there are 

other interactions between processes that 

are worth noting. Given that simulation 

model development is an ongoing process, 

the University should work to adjust these 

models using empirical and mechanistic 

methods and focus on applying them as a 

regulated policy tool.

In improving these models accordingly, 

the University could help research teams 

consolidate generalizable knowledge on 

how agricultural practices affect soil health 

and water quality at the regional scale. 

Administration may argue it doesn’t make 

sense to pursue such efforts to compile 

a comprehensive understanding of soil 

ecology. In essence, it doesn’t make sense to 

develop an all-encompassing evaluation of 

a large area that consists of several different 

ecosystems with unique needs. While this 

rationale could stand for areas with drastic 

changes in their landscapes, it’s important 

that we don’t ignore the benefits that 

comprehensive evaluation could bring for the 

various watershed regions of Michigan and 

the Midwest. In other words, it’s essential 

the University understands how critical this 

research in the Great Lakes is in advancing 

our understanding of watershed ecosystems 

everywhere.

Furthermore, the University should 

understand that advanced research efforts 

toward soil health and water quality could 

create advantages to academia, to Michigan’s 

agriculture and to Michigan’s watersheds. 

As one of the largest public institutions in 

the state and one of the most influential 

academic institutions in the world, the 

University should allocate more resources, 

personnel and attention toward research for 

developing comprehensive evaluations at 

watershed scales. We need this research for 

the improvement of our state and the water 

quality of one of the world’s largest freshwater 

sources, especially since we have continued 

to enable destructive agricultural policy in 

Michigan.

Above all, we have a responsibility as a public 

research institution to inform the public of the 

benefits of imposing different management 

practices on soil health and water quality. The 

need for public reaffirmation is clear. “Despite 

decades of awareness among stakeholders that 

eutrophication presents a global sustainability 

challenge, minimal progress has been made, 

in large part because of social and economic 

barriers within the agricultural sector,” writes a 

number of authors including Thomas Zimnicki 

and Yao Zhang from the American Institute of 

Biological Sciences.

I originally intended on starting this 

review of Eternal Atake with a discussion 

of all the good things that come in small 

packages, like smartphones, Danny DeVito 

and Mini Coopers (which aren’t even that 

great on second thought). I was somehow 

going to tie it all back to Lil Uzi Vert, the pint-

sized Philadelphia energy bomb who is the 

rapper embodiment of good things coming 

in small packages. Uzi 

just 
surprise-released 

his 
highly 
anticipated 

sophomore album Eternal 

Atake last week, so I 

planned 
on 
discussing 

all the ways such a small 

man could hold so many 

excellent ideas inside of 

him. Now, though, that 

all feels pointless because 

Uzi just dropped another 

bomb on us. After a 

steady stream of Twitter 

promotions, Lil Uzi Vert 

has just released the deluxe edition of Eternal 

Atake. Normally this would not be earth-

shattering news because a deluxe edition is 

typically just a couple of new songs tacked on 

to the end of an album in an effort to boost 

sales. Not this time. Uzi released fourteen 

new songs (an entire new album!) called 

LUV vs. The World 2 as the deluxe edition of 

Eternal Atake, and it has rocked the world. 

The diminutive rapper has been trying 

to release Eternal Atake for almost two and 

a half years, but for some reason, his label 

bosses DJ Drama and Don Cannon kept 

blocking him from doing so. After countless 

leaks, several failed rollout attempts (which 

gave listeners gems like “Sanguine Paradise” 

and “That’s a Rack”), threatening to quit 

music multiple times and signing a new 

management deal with Roc Nation, Uzi has 

finally dropped the album. By dropping a 

deluxe edition, he definitely made sure it was 

worth the wait. 

Uzi claims that with the deluxe edition, 

we finally have the album’s intended track 

sequence. That is to say, LUV vs. the World 

2 comes before Eternal Atake, and it makes 

sense. LUV vs. the World 2 is composed of fan 

grails and Uzi’s most hyped snippets, some 

of which date back as far as 2016, whereas 

Eternal Atake is all new songs that are, to be 

blunt, fresh as hell. LUV vs. the World 2 is 

by no means bad, but it doesn’t really sound 

new. It sounds like Lil Uzi Vert circa 2016. 

Still, it’s got some excellent songs. “Myron” 

is the clear standout and most hyped by fans, 

but deep cuts like the frantic, violent, Lil 

Durk-assisted “No Auto” and the brooding, 

contemplative “Moon Relate” keep the ball 

rolling. 

As a standalone album LUV vs. the World 

2, despite the quality of the tracks, lacks the 

cohesion needed to stick with people, but that 

doesn’t matter. LUV vs. the World 2 is not a 

standalone album and it doesn’t have to be. 

Rather, it is something of an appetizer to the 

main course that is Eternal Atake. 

Loosely connected by several unclear, 

largely forgettable skits and divided into three 

distinct parts, Eternal Atake describes Uzi’s 

alien abduction and his 

eventual return to Earth. 

It kicks off with “Baby 

Pluto,” which introduces 

Uzi’s deliriously quick-

tongued alter ego Baby 

Pluto to the world. On the 

track, Uzi raps and he raps 

and he raps, as if he has 

bottomless lungs, about 

nothing in particular. For 

the next five songs, there 

is no Lil Uzi Vert: Baby 

Pluto reigns supreme. Uzi 

rarely shows this side of 

himself, so this part of the album is a real 

treat. He’s not the best lyricist (see lines like 

“Hit your bitch, yeah, she make me wan’ 

body rock / Yeah, your bitch, she a thotty, old 

thotty-thot”), but he doesn’t have to be when 

he flows like he does on “Homecoming” and 

the Full Tilt! Pinball-sampling “You Better 

Move.” 

After 
“Homecoming,” 
though, 
Uzi’s 

focus abruptly shifts. On the next portion 

of the album, from the somber “I’m Sorry” 

to the triumphant “Prices,” he moves from 

breathing fire to healing spirits as he assumes 

a new persona he calls Renji. This new 

persona is defined by saccharine flows and 

restorative instrumentals. He’s still rapping, 

but he’s not spitting. Uzi stretches his words 

and twists his flows, focusing on creating 

and manicuring the desired and more 

cathartic vibe. The Renji portion of the album 

certainly stands out, because Uzi has never 

really done anything like this before. Hell, 

he even connects with none other than Chief 

Keef over “Chrome Hearts Tags” heavenly, 

ethereal beat. However, in this stretch of 

standouts, no song sits more prominently 

than “Bigger than Life.” On this track, Uzi 

finds himself in uncharted territory as he 

reflects on his life over a guitar-driven beat 

that sounds like he’s floating miles above 

Earth. It’s unlike any other Uzi song, and it’s 

all the better for it. Truly, it is a must-listen on 

an album filled with must-listens.

RALPH ARVESEN VIA FLICKR

Commitment is difficult — it is much more 

fun to flirt and keep conversations at surface 

level than it is to actually connect with 

someone. Even more fun than flirting, however, 

is setting up other people. To be the person that 

can say they just knew two people would love 

each other is a feat that most cannot claim. In 

its newest iteration, Jane Austen’s classic novel 

“Emma” is once again brought to life, this time 

with the comically expressive eyes of Anya 

Taylor-Joy (“Glass”) as the heroine and with a 

luxurious English estate covered in pastels.

We all know the story. Emma Woodhouse is 

a spoiled, lovable, conceited and strong-willed 

young woman who loves nothing more than 

pairing up her friends and caring for her father. 

She is, and always will be, completely oblivious 

to the world around her, and it’s impossible 

to blame her. When you’ve grown up with 

everything you could ever ask for and most 

everyone in your life bending to your every 

whim, what of the world do you really need to 

know? 

Anya Taylor-Joy takes every facet of 

Emma’s personality and makes it her own. 

None of the beloved character is ever lost — 

Taylor-Joy’s light and airy voice lends itself 

to condescension and Emma’s aloof nature 

when necessary. Though her cheekbones and 

pursed lips are the perfect accompaniment 

to her character’s skewed vision of the world, 

it is her eyes that push this new Emma into 

the spotlight. Large and expressive, Emma’s 

emotions become clear as her eyes flit around 

the room nervously, her irritation obvious as 

they roll into the back of her head. There is 

little left to the imagination with Taylor-Joy’s 

depiction of Emma, and I wouldn’t have it any 

other way. 

But even though Emma believes the world 

revolves around her, the film itself is careful to 

acknowledge the opposite, developing complex 

relationships between all the characters. 

Specifically, “Emma” displays the carefully 

choreographed social dances of the English 

elite, both literally and figuratively, throughout 

the film. The best part of these performances, 

however, is that the majority of them occur in a 

hat shop. With hat stands and lounging couches 

as key points on the stage, we watch as Emma 

barely tolerates Mrs. Bates (Myra McFadyen, 

“Mamma Mia”). And with each step around 

the shop, Emma moving as far away as she can 

with Mrs. Bates trailing behind her, it becomes 

almost unbearable to watch. I was surprised 

that Taylor-Joy didn’t break the fourth wall. 

The irritation was that palpable. 

This 
new 
“Emma” 
also 
comes 
at 
an 
opportune 

time for Hollywood — Harvey Weinstein was 

recently sentenced to 23 years in jail, and many 

were upset by Greta Gerwig’s lack of an Oscar 

nomination for “Little Women.” And though 

an Oscar snub is nowhere near as awful as 

the actions of Harvey Weinstein, both events 

represent a larger conversation surrounding 

women in Hollywood. And what better person 

to remind us of the importance of a strong will 

than Emma Woodhouse? Despite her flaws, 

Emma knows what she wants and how to get it. 

She has a deep understanding of the nuances of 

high society and is running a larger estate than 

many of the married women in her community. 

As she herself says, “few married women are 

the mistress of their husband’s house as I am 

of Hartfield.” 

At this point, it is unsurprising that another 

adaptation 
of 
“Emma” 
is 
entertaining, 

especially when the source material is already 

fantastic. The layers of intrigue that come 

from this new “Emma” have nothing to do 

with the story and everything to do with who 

is portraying it, and how. Bill Nighy (“Love 

Actually”) ensures the lovability of Mr. 

Woodhouse, while Adam from “Sex Education” 

(Connor Swindells) turns my understanding of 

Mr. Martin on its head. “Emma” is a lovely new 

adaptation that I can’t wait to watch again.

The beauty of ‘Emma’ is 
that it hasn’t changed much

It’s hard to assess an album right now 

without the clutter and confusion of this 

unsure time seeping into the impression 

and coloring the music with something 

that wasn’t there to begin with. But the 

lyrics and sweeping orchestration of indie-

pop band Circa Waves’s newest album 

Sad Happy is founded on that sense of 

confusion — the perpetual millennial and 

Gen-Z condition of 

having one foot in 

a happy place and 

another 
ready 
to 

fall into the void at 

a moment’s notice. 

For an age group who 

has 
been 
through 

multiple recessions, 

an 
aimless 

administration 
and 

now 
a 
worldwide 

pandemic before the 

age of 30, we’ve never 

expected 
stability. 

This year seems to 

be 
another 
crazy 

obstacle in a line of 

them; it is surely the most intense we’ve 

faced, but it isn’t the last. 

There is no way Circa Waves could have 

known this would happen, but this record 

was made in less than a year after their 

April 2019 full-length release, What’s It 

Like Over There?, and the feelings are 

fresh. The past year has been a rollercoaster 

of emotion, leading some to christen 2020 

as the year we’d get it all back together, but 

it seems this has fallen through in many 

ways. However, hope still lingers alongside 

the sadness of the present, which is the 

driving essence of Sad Happy. Circa Waves 

built the album in two parts, releasing the 

first side, Happy, in January, and the full 

version this past Friday. Though we are all 

subject to the automatic shuffle function 

in this day and age, I’d say it’s important 

to take this one side by side, or at least 

in order. The group has obviously put a 

concerted effort into separating the Happy 

and Sad sides by mood while maintaining 

a continuous thread of emotional turmoil 

throughout. 

The separation between each side isn’t 

stark, but rather weaves the same base 

level of yearning into different methods 

of coping. The Happy half is a perfect 

soundtrack for when you feel confused or 

lost and the only option seems to be getting 

drunk and running wild in the streets. It’s 

a fractured happiness — not butterflies 

and rainbows and car commercials, but 

dancing alone in clubs, wondering why 

you’re there in the first place. First single 

and record opener 

“Jacqueline” 
thuds 

on with a shuffling 

guitar 
riff 
and 

energetic vocals from 

frontman 
Kieran 

Shudall, establishing 

the group’s familiar 

brand 
of 
pop/rock 

fusion from the very 

first note. The songs 

on the first half of the 

record have been in 

the world for months, 

settling 
into 
their 

listener’s ears with 

its mix of unease 

and an f-the-world 

mentality that suits Circa Waves’s style so 

perfectly. 

“Sad Happy,” the introduction to the 

record’s second half, is arguably the 

standout of the entire effort. It soothes 

while energizing, the bubbling synths of 

the chorus supporting each languid verse. 

The song, and Circa Waves’ discography 

up to this point, is marked by a mesh of the 

British indie rock sound familiar to groups 

like Arctic Monkeys and the embrace of 

digital production similar to Two Door 

Cinema Club. Listening to Sad Happy 

feels like listening to the “British Indie” 

Pandora radio station in 2013, but with a 

twist of sadness that could only be native 

to this time and place. It’s that mix of both 

nostalgia and bitingly fresh insight which 

makes this double album so interesting to 

listen to during such a confusing period, as 

the whirlwind of narrative and sound takes 

each listener on a ride through everything 

they are able to feel. 

The confusion of young 
adult life on ‘Sad Happy’

CLARA SCOTT

I find it hard to avoid burnout when it 

comes to my own passions and hobbies. 

Food is one of those passions that fell to 

the burnout. I continuously worked in 

the kitchen during my academic career; 

handling, creating and consuming food 

were the highlights of my day in light of the 

drudgery of exams and projects compounded 

by the existential dread of “planning for my 

future.” 

Releasing a fillet of fish from its backbone 

with one smooth glide of your deba knife. 

Furiously mincing your vegetables into 

1/16 inch cuts of brunoise mirepoix that 

yield a silent nod of approval from the chef 

de cuisine. Gingerly retrieving an egg-

white raft of protein scum that threatens to 

destroy your baby of the evening — a pristine, 

transparent lobster consomme. One by one, 

these tasks lose their vibrancy and their 

appeal, reverting back to a similar drudgery 

of tasks not unlike academic work. 

Cue the year 2014. Fresh from producing 

and directing the litany of Marvel films, 

such as “The Avengers” and the “Iron Man” 

series, director/actor Jon Favreau (“The 

Mandalorian”) writes, directs, co-produces 

and stars in “Chef” — a low-budget film 

meant to parallel his own experiences within 

the film industry. His co-producer Roy Choi, 

founder of the Kogi taco trucks, initially 

serves as Favreau’s chef consultant — though 

Choi eventually is given creative freedom 

over all culinary aspects and technical details 

within the movie. When it was released, both 

critics and general audiences enjoyed the 

film. However, Favreau and Choi’s budding 

partnership seemed to reach its denouement 

after the conclusion of the film’s production.

Perhaps it’s Choi’s insistence to properly 

showcase the life of a cook in “Chef” that 

resonates with my own doldrum experiences 

of food and the kitchen. Favreau’s character, 

Carl Casper, finds his own calling within 

food after years of being trapped by 

repeatedly cooking tired, outdated cuisine. 

Though somewhat similar to my experiences, 

I found the film almost invigorating, 

though I dismissed it all the same as some 

fantasization of the kitchen experience at 

large. 

But five years later, Favreau and Choi 

teamed up for their spin-off show called 

“The Chef Show,” which Netflix describes 

as an outlet of recipe experimentation 

between the master and apprentice as they 

also collaborate with celebrities within 

the entertainment and culinary worlds. 

While the episodes match the theme of the 

movie, they are far more informal in tone; 

at separate points, Favreau and Choi both 

confirm that “The Chef Show” represents 

the continuation and maturation of the 

friendship that had stagnated after they had 

completed “Chef.” In other words, “The Chef 

Show” is the spiritual successor to “Chef” 

happening within the world — not some 

other idyllic movie fantasy.

But in spite of the many celebrities 

featured within each episode — ranging 

from movie stars including Robert Downey 

Jr. (“Dolittle”) or Tom Holland (“Onward”) 

to culinary heavyweights like Wolfgang 

Puck, Aaron Franklin and David Chang 

— “The Chef Show” focuses deeply on the 

relationship between Favreau and Choi. In 

particular, Favreau’s passion and eagerness 

to learn culinary skills and traditions 

fuels Choi’s (and other chefs’) respect and 

thus fuels their friendship. At other times, 

Choi’s pensive but engaged demeanor in 

learning about Favreau’s (and other actors 

and filmmakers’) struggles provides an 

additional depth of respect and friendship as 

Choi quietly arranges the mise en place. 

But “The Chef Show” doesn’t focus only 

on the relationship between Favreau and 

Choi. As highlighted as Favreau and Choi’s 

star-crossed friendship might be, it’s the 

expanded individual stories of the two that 

gives their friendship meaning. Favreau’s 

recounting of his claim to fame through the 

Marvel Cinematic Universe provides with 

the same conclusion as Choi’s recounting of 

his exploding popularity through the Kogi 

trucks. Both drew acclaim through hard 

work in uncharted territory — which were 

the great uncertainties and instabilities of 

the MCU and food trucks within 2008. Hard 

work and talent acknowledges hard work and 

talent — which provides much of the impetus 

and spiritual pathos of “The Chef Show.”

More unimaginative fodder for the earnest Never-Trumper

In “A Citizen’s Guide to Beating Donald Trump,” 

David Plouffe offers succinct tips for the energized 

civilian to help their favored candidate ascend the 

White House steps. Each chapter gives insight into 

the general campaign process. His book provides a 

crash course in what a campaign manager would 

want volunteers to know about how to best utilize 

their labor and the campaign’s materials. When 

reading “A Citizen’s Guide to Beating Donald 

Trump,” Plouffe’s optimism reads as genuine as 

he avoids the demoralizing rehashing of status quo 

politics. Like Plouffe, the American Democracy is 

hopeful, a promise to be fulfilled with coalitions 

and earnest votes.

However, beyond general industry insight 

and tips, Plouffe’s 2020 work is an unimaginative 

contribution to the 2020 political book selling 

season. The novel’s thinly dispersed advice 

stretches across 225 pages and offers few novel 

strategies. 

The novel opens with a play-by-play of Election 

Day 2016. In his introduction, Plouffe narrates 

the collective American shock at Donald Trump’s 

2016 win. He notes MSNBC’s somber realization 

and Fox’s surprised jubilation. Though he does not 

fully resuscitate the liberal November 2016 ethos, 

Plouffe succeeds in setting the stakes of his guide 

and asserting the possibility of a 2020 repeat. This 

direct introduction is followed by a somewhat 

patronizing yet engaging sequence of floating, 

repackaged ideas. 

Plouffe does not pontificate on the validity 

of the U.S. electoral process or explore policy 

issues. Instead Plouffe strips the election down, 

interpreting the Great American Democracy as 

a numbers game of voters and delegates. 270 to 

victory — a victory requiring effective volunteers.

In every chapter, Plouffe leans into his 2008 

and 2012 industry acumen, giving his first hand 

accounts of Obama’s stunning loss in the 2008 

New Hampshire Primary and Obama’s rousing 

concession speech. His anecdotes help bind and 

substantiate the book. However, his constant 

references to the Obama Era feels misplaced in 

2020, tinged with nostalgia for a president and 

political climate past.

For 2020, Plouffe imagines heroic volunteers 

and a winsome Obama-esque candidate. He writes 

about a repeat of Will.i.am’s rendition of an Obama 

speech and campaigns pushing volunteer apps. His 

ideas outlined are sound and conventional. The 

Bernie Sanders 2020 campaign underscored their 

“Bern” app at the candidate’s rally at the University 

of Michigan’s Diag in early March. The democratic 

nominee frontrunner also has his Team Joe App 

intended, too, to help coordinate volunteers.

Plouffe’s core message reads as follows: Given 

enthusiastic volunteers, the power and passion of 

the people will prevail. His novel, as per the title, 

envisions a broad audience — citizens unhappy 

with Donald Trump — and presumes that they are 

fired up to engage in politics publicly. His “Anti-

Trump” plan requires all discontented citizens to 

collectively rise up and “GOTV” in 2020. However, 

not a single chapter is dedicated to either convincing 

or reaffirming political involvement. 

Plouffe assumes a base level of political 

engagement in his readers. He fails to invest in 

convincing a passerby, an interested Barnes and 

Noble reader and vital 2020 voter, to become 

politically active. Perhaps, for someone as inured in 

politics and activism as Plouffe, he forgets and leaves 

behind the vast majority of Democratic votes, the 

so-called “whole-food” moms: those dissatisfied 

with the political climate yet unwilling to publicly 

speak out. What those readers require are strategies 

to get “political” without outing themselves as 

political individuals. Plouffe incorrectly assumes 

that most Americans disapprove of Trump and 

adore Obama. He harkens back to 2008 as a political 

Golden Age, forgetting that following Obama’s 

2008 blue wave was a Republican backlash, fueled 

in part by disaffected Obama voters.
