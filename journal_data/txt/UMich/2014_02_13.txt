RESEARCH
Scientists
appeal to
public for
more funds

Crowdfunding push
aims to raise money
to continue study
of heart defects
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily News Editor
With major decreases in feder-
al funding for research, a Univer-
sity professor is asking the public
for help.
Todd Herron, professor of
molecular and integrative physi-
ology, and his team of research-
ers at the University's Center for
Arrhythmia Research plan to use
an innovative form of fundrais-
ing, known as crowdfunding, to
support their research into inher-
ited cardiac arrhythmia diseases
- a disorder passed from one
generation to the next that causes,
the heart to beat irregularly.
Crowdfunding is a relatively
new method of fundraising that
relies on individuals to contrib-
ute to projects or initiatives they

wish to support. Although this
is the first attempt by Herron's
lab, crowdsourcing is growing in
popularity within the scientific
community given the need for
alternative fundingsources.
"It's becoming more difficult
to obtain federal funding for any
kind of biomedical research,"
Herron said. "We're having to
turn to other sources of funding
and this was one avenue that we
thought might be fruitful."
Largely because of federal
sequestration, professors at the
University face ever-increasing
challenges to secure funding for
research projects. Congress out-
lined these automatic 5- to 7-per-
cent budget cuts in an effort to
reduce the deficit by about $1 tril-
lion per year, but require across-
the-board cuts to the federal
agencies that fund the majority of
university-based research.
In the 2013 fiscal year, 62 per-
cent of the University's $1.33 bil-
lion research expenditures came
from federal sources, such as the
National Institute of Health and

negative effects on the mental
activities of children exposed
to violence, Sharkey said the net
effect in the population is likely
improving due to the falling rate
of overall violence.
"The most peaceful time in
the last hundred years is right
now," Sharkey said, citing that
the poorest in society have a
lower violence rate today than
the richest level of society did
in 1993.
LSA sophomore Manvir Man-
gat, who attended the lecture,
said she was surprised violence
has actually declined to a historic
low.
"I guess with social media, you

hear about violence so much, but
you never realize that in actuality
it has decreased so dramatically,"
she said.
According to Sharkey, the cor-
relation between school perfor-
mance and crime rates follows
this trend, as the states where
crime has dropped the most have
seen the largest improvements in
academic achievement over the
same time frame.
"I think we are now at a point
where we can make efforts that
were impossible in the 1990s,"
Sharkey said, referring to a sense
of optimism about urban policy
for the future.

Avegant's 'Glyph'
sends signal directly
to viewer's retina
By TOM MCBRIEN
Daily StaffReporter
As the winter months keep
students indoors, the threat of
screen-induced eyestrain grows.
Seeking a solution, a startup
founded by University alums is
promising a new mobile device
that will bypass screens altogeth-
er, projecting images straight
onto the human retina.
The device, called "Glyph,"
looks like a pair of Beats by Dre
headphones, except that the
headband can flip down in front
of the eyes to provide the user
with an experience equivalent
to watching an 80-inch T.V. eight
feet away.
Avegant, a company co-found-
ed by Engineering alums Edward
Tang and Allan Evans, produces
the innovative video device.
Evans cited the University as
being a strong influence on the
product.
"The technology could have
been done by anyone," Evans, the
chief technology officer of Aveg-

ant, said. "But the path of prod-
uct development was strongly
influenced by our experience at
Michigan."
Evans said coming from the
Midwest gave the company a fun-
damental grounding.
"It gives you a strong under-
standing of what general people
want and will respond to," he
said. "Coming out of Michigan,
we could look to the forefront of
technology and what's cool, but
also bring it back to something
that's going to work for a normal
person."
Avegant has been raising
funds to develop the product
using the online crowdfunding
website Kickstarter, where users
can donate a preset amount of
money to win a prize, such as the
first generation Glyph. Avegant
has been asking for a $499 dona-
tion for pre-sales of the Glyph.
The company made waves
in the tech world when they
smashed their original goal of
raising $250,000 during the first
four hours of pre-sale. They have
now raised about $1,250,000 and
have a week left to go in their
fundraising efforts.

emergency plan
By YARDAIN AMRON
Daily Staff Reporter
As the University recov-
ers from winter's ravages, the
administration continues work

on its snow policy with the help
of a new committee.
After the now-infamous
polar vortex disrupted many
students' return travels to
school in early January,
some hoped classes would be
delayed, but the semesterbegan
as scheduled.
During a subsequent Sen-

University Affairs meeting in
which faculty expressed dis-

mechanisms to close the Uni-

Researchers recover DNA Jurors deliberate in trial

from 12,600 year old remains of murder caused'

Valuable scientific
find could give
insights into many
migration questions
NEW YORK (AP) - The DNA
of a baby boy who was buried in
Montana 12,600 years ago has
been recovered, and it provides
new indications of the ancient
roots of today's American Indi-
ans and other native peoples of
the Americas.
It's the oldest genome ever
recovered from the New World.
Artifacts found with the body
show the boy was part of the
Clovis culture, which existed in
North Americafrom about 13,000
years ago to about 12,600 years
ago and is named for an archaeo-
logical site near Clovis, N.M.
The boy's genome showed his
people were direct ancestors of
many of today's native peoples in

the Americas, researchers said.
He was more closely related to
those in Central and South Amer-
ica than to those in Canada. The
reason for that difference isn't
clear, scientists said.
The researchers said they had
no Native American DNA from
the United States available for
comparison, but that they assume
the results would be same, with
some Native Americans being
direct descendants and others
also closely related.
The DNA also indicates the
boy's ancestors came from Asia,
supporting the standard idea of
ancient migration to the Ameri-
cas by way of a land bridge that
disappeared long ago.
The burial site, northeast of
Livingston, Mont., is the only
burial known from the Clovis cul-
ture. The boy was between 1 year
and 18 months old when he died
of an unknown cause.
He was buried with 125 arti-
facts, including spear points and

elk antler tools. Some were evi-
dentlyritual objects orheirlooms.
The artifacts and the skeleton
were covered with powdered red
ochre, a natural pigment, indicat-
ing a burial ceremony.
The skeleton was discovered
in 1968 next to a rock cliff, but
it's only in recent years that sci-
entists have been able to recover
and analyze complete genomes
from such ancient samples.
The DNA analysis was report-
ed online Wednesday in the jour-
nal Nature by scientists including
Eske Willerslev of the Univer-
sity of Copenhagen in Denmark,
Michael Waters of Texas A&M
University and Shane Doyle of
Montana State University in Boz-
eman. The burial site lies on the
property of the parents of anoth-
er author, Sarah Anzick of Liv-
ingston. It is known as the Anzick
site.
Doyle, a member of the Crow
tribe, said the indication of such
ancient roots for American Indi-

-5.

ans fits with what many tribal
people already believed. He
also said plans are underway to
rebury the boy's remains at the
site after the winter.
The boy "was not a chief or
a great hunter," but his burial
showed love and respect, Doyle
4 said at the Montana Historical
Society in Helena on Wednesday.
8 Next will be a memorial at the
site, he said, "Something small, so
that the state of Montana, people
around the world will know the
importance of that place."
In a telephone conference
with reporters this week, the
researchers said that once they
discovered the link between the
boy and today's Native Ameri-
cans, they sought out American
Indian groups to discuss the
results. Willerslev, an expert in
deciphering ancient DNA, called
3 3 for scientists to work closely with
native peoples on such research.
On Wednesday, he noted there
were Native American groups
who said their oral history
showed that they were descen-
dants of the first people in the
Americas.

Facing potential life
sentence, defense
claims Dunn acted
in self-defense
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP)
- A 47-year-old Florida man
reacted viciously to an argu-
ment over loud music with teen-
agers in a store parking lot and
fired multiple shots into their
vehicle, killing one of them,
and then drove away as if noth-
ing happened, a prosecutor
said Wednesday during closing
arguments at the man's trial.
Defense attorneys argued,
however, that the state failed
to prove its case or show that
Michael Dunn hadn't acted in
self-defense.
Jurors began deliberating in
the late afternoon on whether
Dunn committed first-degree
murder when he fatally shot
17-year-old Jordan Davis outside
a Jacksonville convenience store
in 2012. Dunn, who is pleading
not guilty, faces life in prison if
convicted of that charge.
They deliberated for three
hours Wednesday night before
recessing for the night. Before
they left, they asked to see a con-
venience store security video that
captured sounds of the gunshots.
They said they wanted to watch
the video on Thursday.
Besides first-degree murder,
jurors could also consider the
lesser crimes of second-degree
murder or manslaughter, accord-
ing to the jury instructions. Dunn
also is charged with attempted
murder for shots fired at Davis'
three friends.
In order to conclude that the
killing was justifiable, jurors
must believe it occurred while
resisting an attempt to murder
or commit a felony against Dunn,
Circuit Judge Russell Healey told
jurors.
Assistant State Attorney Erin
Wolfson told jurors that the evi-
dence clearly shows Davis was
unarmed when Dunn fired 10

shots at a Dodge Durango where
Davis was sitting. Wolfson said
no witnesses saw any of the four
teenagers in the vehicle with
a weapon and police searches
turned up none.
"This defendant was disre-
spected by a 17-year-old teenager,
and he lost it. He wasn't happy
with Jordan Davis' attitude.
What was his response? 'You're
not going to talk to me like that,"'
Wolfson said. "He took these
actions because it was premedi-
tated. It was not self-defense."
Dunn's attorney Cory Strolla
told jurors that the state had
failed to prove its case or disprove
Dunn's assertion he acted in self-
defense.
"Not one single witness said
this man (Dunn) showed any
signs of anger," he said.
Strolla argued that there were
no signs Dunn was planning to
do anything that night and only
asked the teens in the car to turn
down the music. Strolla said they
initially did, only to turn it back
up again.
Strolla said Dunn only fired his
gun when he saw Davis wielding
a weapon from inside the Duran-
go and felt threatened.
"He's had that gun for 20 years
and never pulled it once," Strolla
said. "He told you that nobody
has ever scared him, no one has
ever threatened him like that."
Police didn't find a weapon in
the SUV, but Strolla contended
that the teens got rid of it during
the three minutes they were in an
adjacent parking lot after fleeing
the gunshots. He said detectives
should have immediately gone to
the area and searched, but didn't.
In his testimony Tuesday,
Dunn told jurors he was in
Jacksonville with his fiancee,
Rhonda Rouer, to attend his
son's wedding. Dunn said he
and Rouer went to the conve-
nience store for wine and chips.
He said he pulled in next to an
SUV playing loud music.
"My rear view mirror was
shaking. My eardrums were
vibrating. It was ridiculously
loud," Dunn said.

by music
Dunn said he asked the teens
to turn down the music and they
turned it off. "I said, 'Thank
you,"' Dunn said. But soon
afterward, Dunn said he heard
someone in the SUV shouting
expletives and the word "crack-
er" at him. Dunn is white, and
the teens in the SUV were black.
Cracker is a derogatory term for
white people.
The music was turned back
on, and Dunn testified, "I wasn't
going to ask for favors any-
more."
Dunn said the men in the SUV
had "menacing expressions,"
and he asked the teens whether
they were talking about him. He
said he wanted to calm down
the situation but saw a teen in
the backseat reach down for
something. Dunn said it looked
as if the barrel of a shotgun was
sticking out the window.
One of the teens stepped out
of the SUV, Dunn said, and he
felt "this was a clear and pres-
ent danger." He reached for his
pistol in a glove box.
Dunn, who had a concealed-
weapons permit, fired nine
shots into the car, according
to an affidavit. Authorities
say a Both shot fired by Dunn
missed the car. Once his fiancee
returned to the car, he drove off
out of fear of the SUV returning,
he said.
Dunn said he told Rouer on
the drive back to the hotel that
he had shot in self-defense. But
Rouer, called by prosecutors as
a rebuttal witness, said Dunn
never told her he thought Davis
had a gun.
Dunn and Rouer drove back
to their hotel and Dunn said he
didn't call the police because
his focus was on the well-being
of Rouer, whom he described
as hysterical. The next morn-
ing, Dunn said, Rouer insisted
she wanted to go home and they
drove back to their home in Bre-
vard County, 175 miles away.
There, Dunn said he contacted a
neighbor who is in law enforce-
ment for advice on how to turn
himself in.

CROWDFUNDING
From Page IA
National Science Foundation,
according to the University. This
funding has seen steady decline
in recent yegrs. Last year, the
University received $9.6 million
less than it had in previous years
from the NIH, which accounts for
about 38 percent of the Univer-
sity's funding.
The researchers in Herron's lab
plan to set up their crowdfunding
through experiment.com, a web-
site that allows scientists to pro-
mote their projects and receive
financial contributions from indi-
viduals and companies.
"We hope that there will be
companies that will donate large
blocks of money, but also for indi-
viduals, who might not have as
much funding, but who also want
to help with fundraising to keep
this research going ... can also
donate money," Herron said. "Our
hope is that it will be a combina-
tion of the two."

With the help of the funding,
Herron is growing diseased heart
muscle cells from induced plu-
ripotent stem cells. IPS cells are
undifferentiated, meaning they
have the potential to grow into
various types of specialized cells,
such as liver, heart or muscle
cells.
Herron's lab has been working
closely with a single family that
has a history of stress-induced
arrhythmia. Individuals with this
condition experience irregular
heartbeat when engaging in exer-
cise or other physically stressful
activities.
Six members of family have
already been studied. By taking
biopsies from both diseased and
healthy members of the family,
the lab has the ability to establish
changes in the cell lines that may
lead to the future development of
treatments for the disorder.
"Our ultimate goal is to use
these induced pluripotent stem
cell to create cardiac muscle in
a dish," Herron said. "We can
actually recreate their heart

muscle cells in a dish and then
we can study why they're dis-
ease. We can also use them as a
platform to test new drugs and
new therapies."
Although many of the family
members inherited the genetic
factors causing the disease, the
lab must grow new stem cells for
each patient in order to accurate-
ly characterize the disease. The
process costs about $4,500 per
individual, according to Herron.
If successful, the crowdfunding
campaign will help cover the
costs of chemicals and other sup-
plies necessary to continue the
experiments with other family
members.
"It's essential to create patient
specific stem cell lines," Herron
said. "It's not really applicable to
make just one stem cell line and
then say that it's representative
of all the family members."
Unlike embryonic stem cells,
IPS cells do not require tissue
from an embryo. Cells from the
study were isolated from skin
samples. This avoids the con-

troversy that has arisen over
the use of embryonic stem cells
in research, but it has yet to be
proven that IPS cells have the
same versatility.
"There is still some debate in
the research field about whether
the induced - pluripotent stem
cells are as good as the embryon-
ic stem cells," Herron said. "The
IPS cells are synthetic - they're
made in a laboratory - whereas
the embryonic stem cells are
nature's stem cells."
In addition to the potential
therapies that could be devel-
oped with IPS cell research,
Herron said the lab now has an
added incentive: a newborn baby
in the family being studied. If the
researchers can discover the bio-
logical mechanisms that cause
the family's genetic arrhythmia,
it could provide physicians with
valuable information on how
to care for the child before any
symptoms appear.


WEATHER
From Page 1A
Severe Weather was formed.
To gather opinion from the
various University units, the 24
members are from a variety of
departments and include Chief
Health Officer Robert Winfield;
Laurita Thomas, associate vice
president of human resources;
Andy Burchfield, director of
emergency management; Dean of
Students Laura Blake Jones and
Dentistry Prof. Rex Holland, a
member of SACUA.
"There were many concerns
raised by faculty, staff, students
and parents regarding this deci-
sion," the committee's charge
document states. "A review of
our current policies and proce-
dures specific to severe weather
is warranted to ensure they are
in alignment with our principles
and values of stewardship and
safety."

Onesuch concernwasinregard
to staff, and was epitomized after
hazardous temperatures forced
the University to cancel class just
two weeks later.
While classes were canceled
Jan. 28, dining halls, librar-
ies, buses and health services
remained open. All 28,500 staff
members were instructed to
report to work. A memo sent out
to faculty and staff did request
supervisors be flexible due to the
conditions, but staff members
unable or unwilling to brave the
cold had to use a vacation day or
unpaid time off.'
One University staff member,
who wished to remain anony-
mous, said they disapproved
of the University's decision to
require faculty and staff to report
to work.
"That couldn't possibly be fair,"
the staff member said. "If the stu-
dents are available to come to the
library, they will. That doesn't
mean we need to be open. We only

needed a bare-bones staff to run
the librarythat day."
However, another staff mem-
ber, who works in a dining hall,
said it was necessary that din-
ing hall staff show up for work
regardless of the conditions, since
a large number of students, espe-
cially freshmen in the dorms, rely
on their meal plans.
Under the current emergency
closure policy, no distinction is
drawn between critical and non-
critical staff. A "Critical Services"
subcommittee of the larger severe
weather committee is addressing
the question in bi-monthly meet-
ings.
Committee member Kathleen
Donohoe, the associate director
of University human resources,
said the subcommittee's goal is
"to define policy and practice
for the sustainability of critical
operations ... and to recommend
systems to support the work life
issues affecting both critical and
non-critical staff."

Donohue said critical staff
would be those working in facili-
ties and services that must be
maintained around the clock,
such as the hospital, dining halls,
dorms and snow removal.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said some staff mem-
bers are not bound to the office for
their work, and an updated policy
may qualify that distinction.
"Some employees have the abil-
ity to do their jobs from home so
there's flexibility that exists now,"
Fitzgerald said.
The committee's second
monthly meeting is approach-
ing, but no changes will be made
until the policy review is finished
in April, and members submit a
list of recommendations to the
committee's sponsors: Pollack,
Ora H. Pescovitz, executive vice
president for medical affairs and
Timothy P. Slottow, executive
vice president and chief financial
officer.

ter work with teachers," Ball
said.
LessonSketch, a collaboration
between Education Profs. Patri-
cio Herbst and Vu Minh Chieu
and a professor at the University
of Maryland, is a program that
helps teachers model possible
classroom scenarios. Through
100kin10, LessonSketch has
been invited to help teacher edu-
cators who already use the pro-
gram create "representations,"
Ball said.
"They're things you can
watch where you see examples
of really good teaching," she
said. "And those representa-
tions that these people will
build will be distributed to peo-
ple all over the country. So it's
like a project to get people who
are really good at working with
teachers to build materials that
can be used by other teacher
educators."
The two programs are part of
almost 200 other projects that
make up 100Kin10. Ball said the
"big workforce investment" is
aimed not only at training new
teachers, but also those who
have been in the classroom for
years.

tially intriguing for video game
developers who will be able to
allow users to look around just
by moving their head naturally.
Tang said Ann Arbor is the
prime location for the startup
due to its constant flow of gradu-
ates.
"Michigan is the leading
MEMS university probably in

cialized in MEMS at Michigan."

the strategies used to bring it

concepts are beingintroduced as
early as elementary school and
math problems are increasingly
being taught as complex puzzles
to be solved and debated over the

Ball added that these changes
also affect new teachers coming
into the classroom for the first
time.
"The other issue is that there
are new teachers that have to be
prepared to teach this content,"
Ball said. "When they were
growing up as kids their only
experience in school actually
was different from what they're
going to be expected to do as

A slippery situation
Ann Arbor should re-evaluate sidewalk clearance laws
Jn the midst of one of the heaviest winters in the past decade, Ann Arbor
community standards officers have issued 44 tickets and more than 400
warnings to property owners who didn't shovel and clean the sidewalks
in front of their houses within the proper time after a snowfall. The ticketing
has become controversial, as the strict guidelines seem impractical for
property owners to follow. While the snow and ice accumulation is dangerous
to pedestrians if left unattended, it's unfair to put the burden of clearing the
sidewalks solely on property owners. Furthermore, the punishments for not
doing so, or being unable to, do not fit the crime. Ann Arbor and its residents
must come to an reasonable agreement on the caretaking of the sidewalks in
order to ensure the safety of all citizens.

SOPHIA USOW

E-MAIL SOPsIsAus.a)uMIcH.EDu

To the (strong) men

For snow and ice that has accumulated prior
to 6 a.m., property owners are responsible
for clearing it by noon that day. They're also
required to treat the sidewalks with salt or
some other substance to make sure the ice is
not slippery. Within 24 hours after the end
of an accumulation of snow of 1 inch or more,
the snow and ice must be removed. Failure to
comply with the laws in a timely manner may
result in a civil infraction with fines ranging
from $100 to $1000.
While it's understandable that the snow
must be cleared within a decent time frame as
to avoid hazardousor dangerous conditions, it's
especially unfair to give such a short timeline
to clear the snow for people who are working
or out of town during this time. Furthermore,
Ann Arbor's removal regulations and fines are
unreasonable for property owners who may
have more important obligations, including
their employment, children or are traveling.
Other issues such as age or health problems
may also affect property owners' ability to
clear their sidewalks. There are no special
provisions for senior citizens in the Ann Arbor
Snow and Ice Removal Laws. Senior citizens
should be given more time or accommodation
for their snow to be shoveled.
Unshoveled snow is a safety hazard and
can result in serious injuries if not taken care

of. Though able-bodied people can try to get
around the snow without falling or being
injured, it's much more difficult for those who
are disabled. Carolyn Grawi, board member of
the Washtenaw Biking and Walking Coalition,
noted that unshoveled walkways are "a constant
concern for people using wheelchairs." Grawi,
who is legally blind, says she can't distinguish
the edges of the sidewalks when they are
covered with snow. If snow is not cleared away
from sidewalks and in front of properties, those
who are disabled can very easily get stuck.
Similarly, many automatic doors cannot open
because the snow has piled up in front of them
and business owners argue the lack of snow
removal will potentially hurt profits.
To encourage snow removal by property
owners, Ann Arbor should better advertise
that they provide residents with a 5-gallon
bucket's worth of sand and salt mixture
per visit to the maintenance yard to help
clear their snow. They should also increase
awareness of the community standards
helpline phone number that residents
can call after receiving a sidewalk snow
removal notice, or even before if necessary.
Furthermore, Ann Arbor needs to be more
transparent with these solutions, making
sure property owners are aware of the help
that the city provides.

CARLY MANES I
Empowerment, not politics

SONJA KARNOVSKY AND TREVOR DOLAN I
A Key(stone) issue

Environmental activists have been fighting
the proposed Keystone XLpipelinesince itwas
first introduced in 2008. This extension to the
current Keystone oil pipeline in Canada was
met with strong resistance from both activists
and legislators who argued that the impact
of the pipeline was not well understood.
At the time, the Environmental Protection
Agency specifically indicated that existing
data collected by the State Department was
too narrow and did not adequately consider
"oil spill response plans, safety issues and
greenhouse gas concerns." Three weeks ago,
the State Department issued a new report
summarizing its recent study of the potential
environmental impacts of the Keystone XL
pipeline. The report stated the pipeline would
not "significantly exacerbate" the problem of
greenhouse gas emissions. It went on to say
that oil sands extraction would continue at an
accelerating rate with or without Keystone,
pointing out that the crude oil could be moved
by rail failing the pipeline's construction.
This report may seem like a death knell for
the movement against Keystone, but it's not
quite the whole story. The majority of the
report lays out a scenario where oil prices
remain high and thus the tar sands in Alberta
would be developed for their oil regardless
of the creation of Keystone XL. However, if
oil prices - and by extension demand for oil
- are low, then the creation of Keystone XL
would artificially accelerate the destruction
of this land. Alternatively, transporting oil by
rail is more sensitive to market fluctuations
and would actually slow projected develop-
ment of this area. The report does not com-
ment on whether oil prices are likely to be
high or low, but the rigidity of oil production
necessary to sustain a pipeline should be suf-
ficient reason to argue against Keystone XL.
The report also states definitively that the
projected 3,900 jobs created by the construc-
tion of the pipeline would only be temporary.
Supporters of the Keystone XL pipeline often
cite job creation as one of the project's most
appealing features, but after two years only35
jobs would remain. The report from the State
Department has been described as a positive
recommendation for the Keystone XL proj-
ect, but in reality it lays out a more balanced
assessment of the future of the pipeline.
By itself, the State Department report holds
little weight; it's primarily an analysis of the

environmental and economic impacts that the
Keystone XL pipeline may have. This report
was delivered to Secretary of State John Kerry
three weeks ago, giving him 90 days to make a
recommendation on the future of Keystone XL
to President Barack Obama. The Secretary of
State has not made his opinion on the project
public in the past, but he has implied that he
is willing to balance environmental concerns
with corporate interests. However, he has also
previously made clear that he hopes to achieve
meaningful action on climate change during his
time in office. Obama has similarly indicated a
desire to build a strong climate legacy in his sec-
ond term but has taken a cautious approach to
the Keystone XL issue. Kerry's concern for the
environment should make his decision clear: a
definitive recommendation against the creation
of Keystone XL. This will both solidify his posi-
tion as an advocate for environmental issues
and bolster the environmental movement.
Both Kerry and Obama have crucial
decisions to make that will dictate the future
of both Keystone XL and the environmental
movement in the United States. In the fight
against climate change there are few tangible
battles. Far too often, environmental activists
must rally against large-scale crises that
cannot be resolved with one man's decision.
With the Keystone XL pipeline, we have the
chance to make a real difference and let our
voices be heard. We cannot keep coal-fueled
power plants from polluting, nor can we
reverse climate change. Frankly, the majority
of environmental issues are too big to tackle
head-on.We need to pick our battleswisely and
seize the opportunities we have. Preventing
the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline
is one such opportunity. Kerry must advise
Obama against the pipeline and the president
must prevent the pipeline's construction. This
is a battle we must win.
Students on campus will gather to hear state
Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) speak against
the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline
at 6 p.m. on Monday, Feb. 17, in the Central
Student Government Chambers in the Union.
In addition to learning more about this issue,
we will also be signing petitions to send to our
representatives. Come add your voice to this
important cause!

I was apprehensive about coming
to Michigan.
I had never seen a football game
before, didn't believe Wolverines
were real and had a disdain for the
color "maize." After two weeks at
Michigan I re-opened the Common
Application with the intention of
transferring by second semester. I
didn't feel like one of the "leaders and
best" - I just felt lost.
But then things changed.
That transformation happened
at my first football game. The
overwhelming sense of pride that
I felt that day was the catalyst for
the passion I have for this school,
its people and its supporters. In the
most clichd fashion, I felt at home.
Needless to say, I stayed at the
University, and it was undoubtedly
the best decision I've ever made.
However, through my experiences
here, it is undeniable that this place
doesn't always feel like home for all
Wolverines. Depending on what you
look like, act like, identify or don't
identify as, Michigan can feel more
like a personal vendetta than a place
of support and community.
Despite what the promotional
videos tell us, it can't be denied

that at the University, it isn't always
easy to be a Wolverine. Sometimes,
being a Wolverine requires one's
best to merely make it through the
day. From taking out $40,000 in
loans every year to feeling silenced
in our classrooms, there are times
when being a Wolverine can be
tough. Historically, bringing a voice
to these challenges on campus is
silenced more times than not, due
to our insistence that the problems
we face are unique and manageable.
These challenges feel like
individual experiences. In reality,
the problems we face as individuals
can be addressed, and are endowed
with a voice in our Central
Student Government.
However, many students believe
the individuals chosen to speak on
their behalf have fallen silent.
I can assure you, I have not been
silent. That is why I am running for
studentbody president.
For the past three years, I have.
met with students, administrators
and campus leaders to implement
student-driven initiatives, and
change the course ofthe conversation
and the action in CSG. From my
experience as a student activist, I

know that institutionalizing change
is an uphill battle.
But we can't wait anymore, and we
shouldn't have to.
I am running for student
body president because student
government has been unwilling
to take on the challenges that the
students on the front line face every
day for too long. Since my freshman
year, I have been privileged enough
to work with an incredible network of
student activists across identities and
issues. I have seen our work praised
by students, yet largely ignored by
the University's administration. I am
bringing my skills and passion for our
community to this position. But, at
the end of the day, progress requires
all of us working together towards
the betterment of our campus
community, committing to collective
action for campus-wide change.
With the entire campus community
at the base of a student government
fighting for the rights and needs of all
students, we can't lose. I ask you this:
Fortune favors the bold. Will you
join us?

If you hadn't heard (or it wasn't apparent from ev-
erything else on this page), this Friday is Valentine's
Day. Whether you're planning a romantic date night
in with your significant other or riding solo this
year, chances are you're going to need a drink (or
two). With that in mind, here's a Valentine's Day-
inspired recipe. A new twist on an old favorite, the
Strawberry Lemonade Mimosa (adapted from the
FamilyCookbook.com) is sure to please with its
sweet - and slightly tart - flavor and VDay-pink
hue. What's more, it can be made in under 5 minutes
and for less than $10 - and that's something we can
all celebrate this Valentine's Day.

Sex, Media, Reception: New

By BRAD WHIPPLE
Daily Weekend Contributor
For some people this Friday,
Cupid won't have many arrows
to spare.
It's the time when heart-
shaped boxes of chocolates line
the shelves at Walgreens and
that person you met in your Eng-
lish class last semester reminds
you that he or she is very happy
youguys are ... friends. But folks,
look on the bright side: being
single is far from the worst thing
that could happen. You could be
the coach of the Denver Bron-
cos.
So this is for all those single
souls out there. Take charge this
Singles Awareness Day and have
fun, because that's what life is
about. First things first: Do you
have Netflix?
Because that's fun.
While your friends are mak-
ing an appearance on Michigan
Makeouts, you can sit snuggly
in your bed with a friend you'll
always have. Just remember
that Netflix can become an
unhealthy addiction, so use
it with caution. I recommend
"House of Cards" (the second
season is available on Friday).
Not spending the night on
the town with a valentine
means your wallet will be a bit
fatter. That said, you should
really invest in some comfort

food. My first suggestion is
to grab some Angelo's. Parks
and Recreation's Ron Swanson
once wisely said, "There has
never been a sadness that can't
be cured by breakfast food."
And he's right: I've never been
sad after eating a waffle (unless
it was one I made).
If you're not feeling waffles,
try the Ben & Jerry's 'Ver-
monster.' It's 20 scoops of ice
cream meant for seven people,
but don't we all love tackling a
challenge on our own? While
you're at it, find out where the
CCRB is located if you don't
already know because you'll
need to make a visit on Feb. 15.
Spend the extra time out-
side of binge-watching Netflix
by cheering on Team 'Murica
at the Winter Olympics. Don't
mind media reports about the
killer Sochi water or socially
awkward bathrooms, because
only one thing really matters
at the games: America winning
the gold in curling. It's quite
an intense sport full of brooms
and screaming. Also, have you
seen the Ashley Wagner memes
yet? Priceless.
Treat yourself this upcoming
'holiday,' because you deserve it.
Valentine's Day is as important
as homework worth 5 percent
of your total grade - so sit back
with your waffle and seize the
day.

Public pays more than $1
million for Kwame trial I

Kwame's personal
lawyer charged $125
per hour, father's
trial part of expense
DETROIT (AP) - The public
paid more than $1 million for the
yearslong legal defense of for-
mer Detroit Mayor Kwame Kil-
patrick and his father, according
to figures released Wednesday
by a federal court.
The Kilpatricks, like many
defendants in state and federal
court, qualified for attorneys at
the public's expense based on
their income and assets at the
time they were indicted.
Kwame Kilpatrick now is
serving a 28-year prison sen-
tence for corruption. His total
legal tab, including attorney fees
and other costs, was $813,806.
Slightly more than half of that
amount went to his longtime
lawyer, James Thomas.
Thomas said he was paid
$125 an hour, the rate for court-

appointed counsel in Detroit
federal court. The defense
began in summer 2010, when
Kilpatrick was first indicted
for tax crimes. Prosecutors fol-
lowed up with many additional
charges, including racketeering
conspiracy, and the five-month
trial didn't start until fall 2012.
Kilpatrick was convicted of a
sweeping scheme to enrich him-
self through bribes, kickbacks
and extortion. He quit office in
2008 over a different scandal.
Thomas said he had to put
many other cases on hold during
the Kilpatrick trial.
"I practice law at the very
highest level," he said.
"These were 18-hour days,
seven days a week for about six
months. A lawyer went into the
hospital for exhaustion," he
said, referring to an attorney
for co-defendant Bobby Fergu-
son. "It isn't about the money.
It's about doing a good job. ...
The government chose how to
charge this case. A racketeering
case is the most complex of all
criminal cases."

Thomas said hundreds of
hours were not billed. All costs
had to be approved by court offi-
cials.
"This was a worthy effort,"
Thomas said.
Four other Kilpatrick lawyers
were paid in the case, including
Thomas' partner, Michael Naugh-
ton, who received $260,625.
Bernard Kilpatrick's legal
costs added up to $352,777. His
attorney, John Shea, received
$224,957. The elder Kilpatrick
was convicted of a tax crime
and is serving a 15-month prison
sentence.
The government's cost to
investigate and prosecute the
Kilpatricks is "difficult, if not
impossible, to measure," said Gina
Balaya, spokeswoman for the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Detroit.
"The salaries paid to the
prosecutors, paralegals, legal
assistants, agents and other
personnel who worked on this
case are fixed costs. They would
get paid the same regardless of
which case they are working
on," she said.

Hawaiian bill would make the
ukelele the 'official' instrument

Supporters consider
it to be a key part of
the state's culture
HONOLULU (AP) - Its frisky
four strings are the sound of
Elvis's "Blue Hawaii," of Tiny
Tim tiptoeing through the tulips
and lately, beyond all reason, of a
popular "Bohemian Rhapsody"
cover.
Above all, the humble ukulele
- dubbed "the underdog of all
instruments" by virtuoso Jake
Shimabukuro who busted out
his rendition of the aforemen-
tioned Queen classic in a recent
performance - sounds like
Hawaii.
Lawmakers here are consid-
ering a bill that would dub the
ukulele the official state instru-
ment, a designation that seems
in some ways like a formal cer-

emony for a common-law mar-
riage.
"Denying this bill would be
like denying a significant part
of who we are," Ani Martiro-
sian Menon, a Honolulu resi-
dent by way of Los Angeles,
told a House committee hearing
Wednesday.
She credited the instrument
with helpingher, and anyone else
who has ever come to Hawaii, to
understand the islands. "It's a
sincere melting pot," she said. "If
you've never been here before,
you're not going to know how
to adjust. The ukulele is a really
good entry point to connect with
the local culture."
Bette Midler belting out
"Ukulele Lady" on national
television, backed by a ukulele
choir, helped bring the instru-
ment's sound to the masses. But
the ukulele can seem ubiquitous
on the islands themselves. Visi-

tors hear ukuleles at Hawaiian
airports. Callers to state govern-
ment offices hear it paired with
a soothing steel guitar as hold
music - perhaps aimed at calm-
ing irate constituents.
A few states have designated
state instruments, but none is
so synonymous as the ukulele
to Hawaii. Texas called dibs on
the guitar. Louisiana put zydeco
ahead of jazz in honoring the
accordion. Missouri claimed
to the fiddle. But so did Arkan-
sas. And Oklahoma. And South
Dakota.
The ukulele and Hawaii are
a more distinct pairing. They're
so intertwined that when Jim
Tranquada, co-author with Jim
King of "The Ukulele: A His-
tory," was told of the bill, his
response was surprise - not
that Hawaii was so honoring the
ukulele, but that the state hadn't
already.

of a wave of increasingly violent,
student-led protests that have
spread across Venezuela the past
two weeks. Their anger is being
fueled by frustration with Mad-
uro's handling of the inflation-
plagued economy, worsening
crime and humanrights concerns.
Pro-government supporters
countered with a march of their
own Wednesday to express sup-
port for Maduro, who has accused
opponents of trying to violently
oust him from power just two
months after his party's candi-
dates prevailed by a landslide in
mayoral elections.
While anti-government dem-
onstrators vented frustration over
a range of issues they were united
in their resolve to force Maduro
out of office by constitutional
means.
"All of these problems - short-
ages, inflation, insecurity, the lack
of opportunities - have a single
culprit: the government," Leop-
oldo Lopez, a Harvard Univer-
sity-trained former mayor, told
a crowd of about 10,000 people
gathered at Plaza Venezuela in
Caracas.
Lopez, who leads a faction
of the opposition that has chal-
lenged what it considers the meek
leadership of two-time presiden-
tial candidate Henrique Capriles,
called the protests "a moral and
patriotic duty."

from the start of the season, defenseman Kevin Clare.

PAUL SrdnMAN/Daily
Junior forward Andrew Sinelli played three games before he transitinned In heist a dlefenseman - a position in which he has started 13 consecutive games.

And that presence has been key to
how the 10th-ranked Wolverines
have performed in the Big Ten.
"He's defensive-minded and
fast enough that he can make
up for mistakes. He plays a
pretty simple game," said senior
defenseman Mac Bennett. "And
he's done it unbelievably well.
"If you took any other forward
and put him at defenseman, I
don't think they'd do as good a job
as Sinelli."
The switch wasn't out of
choice, but rather out of need.
After junior defenseman Bren-
nan Serville suffered a head inju-

However, Sinelli isn't the
first forward in program
history to move from forward
to defenseman. Just last year,
former forward Jeff Rohrkemper
was called upon to fill that role
after former defenseman Jacob
Trouba was suspended.
But the difference between the
two is that Rohrkemper filled in
sparingly - a temporary replace-
ment who was otherwise left to
fight for ice time as a forward.
"Most hockey players will tell
you to get them in the game,"
Rohrkemper said, "they'll play
any position you want."

The transition from forward to
defenseman requires an advanced
ability to skate. The defenseman
must be able to excel at skating
backward fast enough to keep
up with streaking forwards and
pivot quick enough to square up,
nuances that both Rohrkemper
and Sinelli had to embrace.
It also helps to have a large
body frame, which neither
Rohrkemper nor Sinelli possess.
At 5-foot-10 and 180 pounds,
Sinelli lacks the height and
weight of some of his teammates
and some opposing forwards.
But what's tougher is playing
like he's 6-foot-3 and more than
200 pounds.
"I think the toughest part is
just to play with confidence,"
Rohrkemper said. "But one thing
that benefited me and one thing
that benefits Andrew is being a
reliable forward defensively. If

you already have the confidence
and ability to play well defensively,
that factors in."
It's difficult to measure how
Sinelli has performed this
season at defenseman. Unlike
the forward position, which uses
goals and assists as the best way
to measure success, defense has
little to reference.
"It's a position where you're
graded on who has the fewest
mistakes," Berenson said.
In his time since then,
Sinelli's minus-five rating
doesn't necessarily indicate his
performance. But more telling
may be that Michigan has won 10
of the 13 games Sinelli has been
on the ice as a defenseman.
Even more telling is the 2.16
goals-against average that the

Wolverines have posted in the
past six games with Sinelli's
improved performance.
"I've definitely had my
struggles but think it went
smoother than I thought," Sinelli
said. "My skating really helps.
I've been pretty steady. I haven't
done anything spectacular, but
I haven't done anything that's
negatively affected us."
Added Bennett: "He's a guy
that we kind of rely on, so we have
to makesure he keepsgoinginthe
right direction." '
With each game, Sinelli
continues to improve, getting
more physical in front of the net,
pushing the puck forward or
making a hit worthy of a replay.
Before his switch to defense-
man, Andrew Sinelli played in

three games. He finished with
one assist and a plus-one rating.
But with a depth chart stocked
with forwards, playing time
became an increasing struggle.
He'll be the first to tell you that
he wasn't scoring goals before the
switch, so it's not the end of the
world to play in a new position.
"It might be the best thing he
ever did," Berenson said.
Added Sinelli: "I'm just kind
of grasping the opportunity and
making sure I don't lose it. I'm
just happy to help any way I can."
Sinelli's 6-foot-5 wingspan
separates him from other play-
ers. It's noticeable, and it allows
him to get away with using a
shorter stick forwards use in
practice and games.
He's never had a need to switch
sticks until now. But part of him
won't give that up. It's all he has
left to feel like one of the forwards.

that goal might become more
attainable for the Michigan

Wednesday, the Wolverines
welcomed seven freshmen -
four ranked among IMG Acad-
emy's Top 150 players - and one
junior transfer to the program
next season.
The seven freshmen - for-
wards Nathan Kohl and Ahin-
ga Selemani, midfielders Jake
Duska, Tristan Jacob and Hans
Lee, defender Billy Stevens and
goalkeeper Evan Lauro - hail
from five different states (Michi-
gan, Ohio, New York, New Jer-

Originally from Nottingham,
England, Mellors-Blair trained
at the Manchester United Acad-

sional contract with Walsall
FC. Mellors-Blair, who's already

"(Will) gets the benefit of
being with us early and getting
acclimated with the program,"
Daley said. "He's gotalittle bit of
everything. He's got good pace,
excellent quality, can score goals
and can certainly set up people
as well."
Selemani headlines the
freshman group after playing
for the U.S. U-18 National Team.
The No. 12 recruit Selemani
recently traveled to Spain with

the national team to play for
the Copa Del Atlintico and
competed for the United States
in the 2013 CONCACAF U-17
Championship, scoring one goal.
An Ann Arbor resident,
Selemani ultimately decided not
to venture too far from home
when he made his decision.
Michigan wasn't his first choice
- he was an early verbal commit
to play at Division I power UC
Santa Barbara before changing
his decision to Michigan late in
the recruiting process.
For a team that only scored
1.23 goals per game and lacked a
pure scorer last season, Selemani
will push the team's veteran
forwards for playing time next
season.
"He's a technical, hard-
working center forward who
makes excellent runs," Daley
said. "He's very quick and
dynamic on the ball and will
add some scoring punch to
our offense. He's also going to
stretch defenses and allow our
midfielders to dictate play."
Lauroisthe No. 2goalkeeperin

with Selemani in the 2013
CONCACAF Championship.
While Michigan has a stalwart

in fifth-year senior and captain
goalkeeper Adam Grinwis at
the back, Lauro will battle with
freshman Grant Mattia for the
right to be Grinwis' backup.
Kohl and Stevens round out
the rest of the group ranked in
IMG Academy's Top 150 players.
Six of the seven recruits come
from soccer academies where
they played for highly competi-
tive and well-coached teams
that should prepare the recruits
for the life and schedule of a
college soccer player. Four out
of the seven freshman recruits
will also have time with the U.S.
National team under their belt.
"They've competed with the
best players in the country since
they were 14, 15 years old," Daley
said. "They'll have experience
playing against top players all
around the world in all kinds of
different environments. They
certainly won't be new to hostile
environments which will bode
well for their development."
Coming off of a season where
the Wolverines were bounced
from the first round of the Big
Ten Tournament and did nof",
make the NCAA Tournament,
the new crop of recruits may
be just what Michigan needs
to come back from a lackluster
season.

Navigating an uncertain future at the 'U'
V ( l l ii' ll .N lu ll) ()l-----------------T O l

We have a gamelan... but what is it?
A gamelan is a group of musical instruments - ones steeped in
thousands ofyears of Javanese and Balinese tradition and built and
tuned as a unified harmonic ensemble. Each gamelan is unique,
and instruments from one gamelan are generally not interchange-
able with those of another.
Gamelan performances can range from just music to a multi-art
spectacular featuring traditional dance, costumes and elaborate
puppet theatre. Ritual preparation precedes the performances,
Offerings are presented to the spirits of the sacred musical ensem-
ble. Drawingfrom Hindu and Buddhist practices, performers work
to reach a level of profound concentration and fiery enthusiasm.
There are fewer than 200 gamelans in the United States and
only one in Michigan - ours. But now, with changes looming at
the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, some fear the future of our
gamelan isn't so secure.
We have a gamelan... but how'd we get it in the first place?
1965 was a year marked by growing tensions in American rela-
tions with Southeast Asian nations and an escalation of the war
in Vietnam. In March of that year, the University witnessed the
first major "teach-in," an educational anti-war demonstration that
later spread to many other institutions of higher education. Mean-
while, the 1964-65 World's Fair, with its theme of "Peace Through
Understanding," served in some ways as a beacon of hope. Indo-

nesia was the first Southeast Asian nation to agree to participate
- a 69-piece Javanese gamelan was a highlight of its exhibit. But
anti-Western sentiments caused Indonesia to withdraw from the
United Nations and remove its exhibit from the World's Fair. Due
to financial difficulties, they needed to sell the gamelan.
The University competed with Wesleyan University to pur-
chase it, each putting down $2,000 for the set. Somehow, a second
gamelan was procured and each institution received one.
We have agamelan ... now what?
Judith Becker, who was a graduate student studying ethnomu-
sicology at the University when the gamelan arrived in the '60s,
recalls being thrilled when it was first delivered to campus. She
listened to recordings, learned gamelan herself and helped estab-
lish an ensemble. A year or so later, Susan Walton, now the direc-
tor of the University's ensemble, joined the gamelan.
"I found the gamelan just by luck and fell in love with it," Wal-
ton said. "It taught me all sorts of musical principles that I hadn't
been aware of. It also modeled a kind of communal way of doing
music, which I thought was wonderful: the notion that anybody
can play music. That playing music together was like having a
party together. Some people at the party know how to sing bet-
ter than others, but nobody really cares - the whole point is that
you're playing it, you're singing it together."
By 1971, Walton was traveling to the archipelago nation to do
original research and make connections that would later help to

expand the University's gamelan program.
"I was learning about another culture and falling in love with
the language and the people, the history and the art and music it's
almost like a love affair - just a passion for everything Indone-
sian. And I see that in so many of my students too," Walton said.
Over the years, Becker and Walton have attracted generations
of renowned artists for gamelan residencies. Since 1967 there have
been 51 residencies of puppeteers, dancers or musicians. Some are
for a year, some for a semester, others for just a short time.
We have a gamelan...
Saturday, Feb.15 at Stamps Auditorium
The University's gamelan resident is Midiyanto, the director
of the University of California, Berkeley Gamelan and a seventh
generation gamelan performer. He's been coaching student and
faculty performers in preparation for Saturday's concert. He's
also teaching a Wayang Kulit workshop exploring the symbol-
ism and philosophy of traditional shadow puppet theater, and
the stories it often depicts from the great Indian epics, the
Mahabharata and the Ramayana.
In 1988, a young Midiyanto came to the University for
the first time and played with the gamelan ensemble. Fifteen
years later, he returned for a residency. Now he's back for a
third go-around. Instead of staying on the west coast for UC,
Berkeley's winter break, Midiyanto chose to spend these six
weeks in Michigan.

Looking into Pride
Night at Necto

In this series, three Daily Arts writers
in varying states of mind visit the same
place and write about their experiences.
this week's destination:
Sochi Olympics Opening Ceremony

We found love in a
safer place - the
famed A2nightclub,
By NATALIE GADBOIS
Senior Arts Editor
We're all familiar with
straight spaces, even if we don't
know the term. The frat par-
ties, where a combination of
Heaven Hill and Drake creates
the assumption that any boy
can grind up against any girl.
College bars, where ladies pay
half price for shots on Thurs-
day nights, the owners finding
ways to make girls "loose," and
ways to entice the men to show
up.
House parties, social circles
and even classrooms; so many
function under the assumption
that unless you say otherwise,
you're straight, and that's
that. These pervasive straight
spaces are what made the idea
of spending a Friday at Pride
Night at Necto nightclub all
the more intriguing - and, to
be honest, a little disconcert-
ing.
The getting ready process
was the same - dashing on
make-up, confirming with
my roommate that my outfit
was the perfect combination
of cute and edgy, consuming
fiery substances from chipped
Costa Rican shot glasses - but
the destination was so differ-
ent from what I knew.
Pride Night was started
in 1984 and has remained .a
nightlife fixture in the gay
community in Ann Arbor since
then, voted multiple times as
the best gay club in the Metro
Detroitarea. The large club,
located on East Liberty, has
two dance rooms, both with
live DJs, with the famous Red
Room downstairs playing ret-
ro-pop hits with accompany-
ing videos - mainly Beyonci
and '80s dance-pop the night I
was there.
The crowd is filled with
closely dancing couples, the
gender composition more
heavily male than any party I
had ever been to before. Both
rooms feature accessible stag-
es and stripper poles, which
guests are encouraged to hop
on to.
Necto touts itself as the
place to be on a Friday night
for the gay community, an
association that comes with
some complexities and some
questions. How do you define
a safe space for gays? And once
defined, how do you success-
fully construct that space?
LSA junior Schuyler Robin-
son believes that a "gay space"
is "a place kind of free of judg-
ment, because as gay people
we sometimes deal with stig-
ma and feel judged solely by
being ourselves."

Robinson argues that while
Necto is a fun place, some-
where to dance and let loose, it
isn't the inclusive safe space it
can be represented as. He has
seen straight female friends
be harassed and targeted with
language that discriminates
them just as props for their gay
friends. In an effort to clas-
sify Pride Night as a common
ground for the gay community,
sometimes other identities can
become marginalized.
"Because people feel so
comfortable and so non-tar-
geted, they almost feel like
their words aren't account-
able," Robinson said. "Because
they are in their space, they
are not the minority there."
Similarly, LSA senior Tay-
lor Portela, a volunteer at the
Spectrum Center, agrees that
Necto is the best place to go
dance, but is wary to define it
as a safe space.
"Necto is a beautiful, ter-
rifying place," Portela said.
"It is a gay space, but at the
same time it's a gay space
with a twist, so when I bring
women of any orientation and
identity they still are actively
harassed."
Portela defines the distinc-
tion between a gay space and
a queer space, holding that gay
spaces are often dominated by
gay white males, while queer
spaces are more inclusive of
women and racial minorities.
Pride Night, he argues, is dis-
tinctly a gay space - an unfor-
tunate limitation for the club.
"At Necto there are just a
ton of white cisgenders; gay
white men, dancing and doing
their thing - which is fine.
It's good. I mean, I am one of
them," Portela said. "But at
the same time my friends of
color get harassed, women get
harassed ..."
Neither Portela nor Robin-
son believes that Necto nec-
essarily promotes healthy
connections in a way safe
spaces ought to. The pound-
ing music and dark rooms
make conversation difficult,
so the club becomes marked
as the hookup place - though
he's gone many nights, Robin-
son can't recall ever making a
real friend or fostering a rela-
tionship with someone he met
at Necto.
"You walk in (and) there's
music, its dark - it's not so
conducive to welcoming peo-
ple."
"It's like the gay version of
Rick's," Portela said.
Rick's: an Ann Arbor bas-
tion of drunken hookups
and texts-from-last-night
anecdotes. But is it problem-
atic when the predominant
nighttime gay space in Ann
Arbor promotes that culture?
Though they reiterate that
Necto is a fun space (a state-
ment I agree with entirely), at

times its frenetic, hyper-sex-
ualized atmosphere can per-
petuate limiting stereotypes
about the gay community.
"(Necto) feeds into the ste-
reotype that gay people are
obsessed with bodies, about
putting out a good self-image
rather than trying to connect
with someone," Robinson
said.
Portela affirms this, but
doesn't think this depiction
of gay culture is wholly nega-
tive.
"Gay culture is very much
built around some stereo-
types, yes, but part of gay cul-
ture - gay white male culture
- is having song-tunes and
Whitney Houston playing in
the background, the'80s synth
pop blast really loud," he said.
"While (Necto) is affirming
of some stereotypes, it points
toward a larger gay culture,
like the club culture that is in
this atmosphere."
Both men were excited
about the opening of a new
gay night in town, Candy Bar,
located at Live Nightclub. The
event premiered last Thurs-
day, and Robinson and Portela
each hailed it as a more inclu-
sive but still fun environment.
On opening night, Candy Bar
had ahost and DJs, and featured
a drag queen performance from
former contestants on the real-
ity show "RuPaul's Drag Race."
"(Candy Bar is a) much bet-
ter space, because at Necto you
can't hear anyone, so I think
people can connect more and
get to know each other better
at that space," Robinson said.
"And it was really fun. The DJ
played great music, all the atti-
tudes just seemed much more
positive."
Though Candy Bar only
hosted its inaugural night a
week ago, Portela finds the
combination of this event with
Necto to be promising for Ann
Arbor's gay and queer commu-
nity.
"I really like the set up of
Live, so that was, atmosphere-
wise, very enjoyable," Portela
said. "(It's) a really nice space
because it was people of more
than just one or two identi-
ties who filled the space, and
I didn't hear afterwards of any
real threatening or harassment
going on."
With the induction of Candy
Bar, Ann Arbor is growing as
a destination for gay nightlife
scenes, a relief for students
who currently feel limited in
predominantly straight spac-
es. However, the complexity
behind Necto proves that just
the construction of a gay space
is not enough - an inclusive
environment comes from the
clientele and the set up of the
space itself. But wherever you
choose to go, it's Friday night,
it's -20 degrees out, and every-
one just wants to have fun.

I refuse to believe Russia actually looks like this. I also refuse to
believe that we're "bobsledding past these tragedies," Bob Costas. This
floating girl is horrifying. Why does that balloon have eyes? Fuck Putin
Free Pussy Riot. Matt Lauer's beard looks like chaotic pubes. Putin
looks constipated. The people who dress like lights who dress like the
flag are freaking me out. Why are these so long? Cool blue dress it's not
like you blend into the floor or anything. This is really overwhelming.
I'm really tired right now and I want to nap but no space is available to
lay down. Lie down? Become horizontal. The ceremony is getting kind
of shitty. Wait they're skating. Nevermind, great job. This is still real-
ly stressing me out. MATT LAUER SHUT UP ABOUT BREAKFAST.
Goodnight from Russia.
-DAILYARTS WRITER
Matt Lauer always brings us down. The actual Matt Lauer, not the
nickname one. So far we've seen a white horse, some creepy people
dressed in colored light suits, like that movie with Olivia Wilde when
they went to a different techno world. I Googled it, that movie was
called TRON.
Then all of the countries come out. Germany is like a rainbow Care
Bear. My friend Aaron Carter can't stop laughing every time the word
Russia is spoken. That's concerning. Alec has been quiet for 45 minutes.
That's uncomfortable. Putin is so angry cause the fifth ring didn't open.
Bob Costas is telling me that Putin is in total control. I believe him.
Throughout there is a little girl who keeps floating, and I wonder
about her past. She makes me sad. There were some bouncy castles
shaped like mosques for a while, but I was eating my first Pizza Bob's
chipati, so I was distracted.
We fast-forwarded because this is boring and Alec and Aaron are
about to fall asleep. Now these women have jelly fish on their heads,
and the music from Harry Potter is playing in the background. Or from
"Black Swan." I don't know. That's my consensus on this opening cer-
emony. I just don't know. But Meredith Vieira is going to give me the
answers after the commercial break.
Take home: Matt Lauer is a breakfast whore. Goodnight from Russia.
-DAILYARTS WRITER
As Aaron Carter and I arrive at Hilary Duff's apartment, it's
clear we are all in for an interesting night. After spending a longer than
necessary amount of time choosing a restaurant to order dinner from,
and lamenting over the fact that Arts Editor @NotAkshaySeth will in
fact not be joining us, we get down to business. With a wine glass in
hand, Hilary looks on as Aaron gets in the right "state of mind" for his
portion of the assignment. Now, with everyone ready, it's time to watch
the Olympics opening ceremony. The first sequence, complete with
sweeping landscape shots and beautiful scenery, confuses each of us
in distinct ways. As Aaron puts it, "this is definitely not what Russia
looks like." As the ceremony presses on, nothing can compare to our
Pizza Bob's chipatis. In Hilary's words, it was the best thing she's ever
eaten. As we continue to chow down, Meredith Vieira's clear animosity
towards Sochi was the only thing we could talk about. No disrespect
to Matt Lauer or the stunning visuals orchestrated by some of Russia's
top talents, but Meredith's consistently passive aggressive commen-
tary overshadowed anything else that happened on NBC - at least for
these three drunk, sober and high students. It's really the only thing
I'll remember when this is all over. And with that, I'll bid you a goodbye
from Russia.

Ranking hip hop's
premiere ive labels
Presenting the
hottest collectives
in rap music
By JOSH FRAZIERr
DailyArts Writer"

Va entine's Day
meals made on
a budget

Rap is fixated on perfection.
The argument for "Best Rapper
Alive" is as relevant today as it
was 25 years ago. The debate can
quickly become territorial, and
even the artists themselves fre-
quently weigh in with their own
opinions. Naturally, every rap-
per is convinced that not only
are they the most gifted, but also
that everyone they work with is
the best in the business, too. As a
result, debates over rap label supe-
riority have existed since the Bad
Boy/Death Row feud of the 1990s,
as record labels compete with each
other in an ongoing arms race to
stock the most talented artists.
Skilled up-and-comers like the
Pro Era collective and the A$AP
Mob are bringing New York City
rap back to the forefront, and
Taylor Gang Entertainment and
Grand Hustle are attempting to
stay relevant as their star power
wanes, yet none of these labels
are the best in the business
today. Here are the five hottest
collections of talent in rap right
now and why:
5. Maybach Music Group
Top Artists:Rick Ross, Meek
Mill, Wale, Rockie Fresh
Album to watch for in 2014:
"Mastermind,"Rick Ross
(Mar. 4)
MMG has seen better days.
The once buzzed-about label
has a solid roster of established
veterans but has seen its rel-
evance plummet in the last sev-
eral years. Maybach Music has
moved to sign many emerging
young rappers like Rockie Fresh
and Fat Trel in an attempt to
stay relevant, but none of these
acts have yet popped on the
national scale. Rick Ross's crew
released an underwhelming
group compilation in the fall,
and both Wale and Meek Mill's
most recent ventures failed to
meet sales expectations. Look
for Mastermind, Ross's upcom-
ing sixth studio album, to
either return MMG to its chart-
topping prime or continue its
steady decline into mediocrity.
4. Save Money Collective
Top Artists: Chance the Rapper,
Vic Mensa, Joey Purp
Album to watch for in 2014: n/a
The situation surrounding
Save Money couldn't be more
different than that of Maybach
Music. 2013 was a breakout year
from the Chicago-based crew,
as they received national atten-
tion for a slew of stand-out proj-
ects. Chance the Rapper's Acid
Rap tape was released to wide-
spread critical acclaim, mak-
ing him a household name. Vic
Mensa's INNANETAPE was an

Everything's G.O.O.D.
equally strong body of work that
demonstrated the raw energy
and creativity that has become
the signature for this hip hop
collective. There are no sched-
uled upcoming releases from
the Save Money kids, but any
move from these rising talents
is definitely worth paying atten-
tion to. With Chance the Rapper
becoming a legitimate star, this
budding group of Midwestern
teenagers could make an even
bigger splash this year.
3. Young Money
Top Artists: Lil Wayne, Drake,
Nicki Mina, DJKhaled, Tyga
Album to watchfor in 2014:
"YoungMoney: Rise ofan
Empire" (Mar.11)
Li Wayne is not the rap-
per he once was. His decline is
painstakingly clear after listen-
ing to any of his recent releases,
which feature sluggish flows
and a disinterested artist. Only
a few short years ago, he was the
undisputed hottest rapper alive,
equal parts witty, vulgar and
maniacal. Fortunately for the
aging label head, the talent he has
surrounded himself with keeps
churningouthits. Drake's sublime
Nothing Was the Same was one of
the best albums of 2013, with its
off-kilter R&B, braggadocio raps
and undeniable pop smashes. The
first lady of Young Money, Nicki
Minaj, continues to blur the line
between radio hits and mesmer-
izing lyrics, and her recent remix
of Young Thug's "Danny Glover"
is evidence that when she puts her
mind to rapping, Minaj can spit
with the best of them. The label
has an upcoming compilation
album, which could help bolster
YoungMoney's credibility beyond
its big-name stars.
2. Top Dawg Entertainment
TopArtiss:Kendrick Lamar,
Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock
Album to wachfor in 2014:
"Oxymoron," Schoolboy Q
(Feb.25)
KendrickLamar isthe bestrap-
per alive. From his stellar major

n honor of Valentine's
Day - that's tomorrow
for all of you last-min-
ute folks out there - this week
we're taking a look at three
of the most
romantic res-
taurants in i
Ann Arbor
and the deli-
cious foods
they offer. If
you already
have . a res- NATE
ervation at WOOD
one of these
spots, rock
on! If not, no problem. Using
the Valentine's Day menus at
the Melting Pot, Chop House
and Gandy Dancer as inspira-
tion, I've crafted three do-it-
yourself dinner menus that you
- yes, you - can whip together
to impress your date in the com-
fort of your very own home or
apartment. (Sorry to those of
you who still live in dorms.)
The dishes aren't too terribly
complicated to prepare but
will make it look like you really
know what you're doing. And

palate. Season liberally with
salt and pepper or a dash of
McCormick's Montreal Steak
Grill Seasoning. Broil to your
liking; I suggest medium rare.
Baked Potato - These can
literally be made in the micro-
wave by poking a few holes in
a rinsed spud and clicking the
"baked potato" button. Add
butter, sour cream, chives and
freshly cracked black pepper
before plating.
Steamed Broccoli - This
one's a no-brainer. With a gloss
of butter to finish, the green of
the broccoli really pops on the
plate of otherwise brown meat
and starch.
Cheesecake - If you have
a springform pan and are up
to the challenge, try making
your own! Otherwise, there's
no shame in buying a plain
cheesecake at the store and
adding chocolate syrup, fresh
strawberries or blueberries, hot
fudge, caramel or whatever you
like on top.
The Gandy Dancer

DEF JAM
label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city,
to his jaw-dropping "Control"
verse, it's clear that there is sim-
ply no one right now better at the
physical delivery of spitting vers-
es. Surrounded by a stacked ros-
ter of West Coast stars, the Black
Hippy Crew is clearly one of the
best in the business. Recent sign-
ees Isaiah Rashad and SZA are
new additions to a label already
featuring a superb lyricist in Ab-
Soul, a gritty street rapper in Jay
Rock and Kendrick's second-in-
command, Schoolboy Q, whose
upcoming album, Oxymoron, is
one of six projects the label plans
to release this year. TDE is com-
mercially and critically success-
ful, but it narrowly misses out on
the top ranking due to a banner
year from one of the most polar-
izing figures in music.
1. G.O.O.D. Music
Top Artists:Kanye West, Pusha T,
BigSean, John Legend
Album to watch for in 2014: n/a
It's hard to deny the influence
that Kanye West has on pop cul-
ture. The divisive artist is praised
by some as a visionary musical
genius, yet seen as a delusional
egoist by others. While both opin-
ions are valid, West is a consum-
mate entertainer working at an
all-time creative high. And the
artists signed to G.O.O.D. Music
are some of the most exciting fig-
ures in all of music. West execu-
tive produced Pusha T's excellent
My Name is My Name and John
Legend's soulful Love in the
Future, while Big Sean is a radio
mainstay. West's most recent solo
album, Yeezus is a tour de force
that is one of the most gripping
rap records ever made. The sellout
tour accompanying the album
demonstrated how engaging
Kanye West can truly be. The
opening act for West? Kendrick
Lamar. Despite Lamar's impres-
sive lyricism and technical abil-
ities, West's cult of personality
makes him an indisputable star.
The impact G.O.O.D. Music has
on the rap landscape makes
them the hottest (and best) label
in rap today.

opaque, flipping once.
Fresh Asparagus - I pre-
fer the thinner stalks because
they're not as fibrous, but take
whatever you can get this time
of year. Roast them in the oven,
saut6 them in butter or steam
them until tender. Like the
broccoli mentioned before, their
green color will really brighten
the plate. (Plus, they're a natural
aphrodisiac. You're welcome.)
Vanilla Bean Ice Cream -
Keep it simple with a scoop or
two of Haagen-Dazs: smooth,
rich, creamy, vanilla bean-fleck-
ed heaven.
The Melting Pot
The Melting Pot is a chain,
yes, but a fun and romantic meal
nonetheless. If you're thinking
about going there, be sure to
check out the special Valentine's
Day menu on their website.
Cheese Fondue - Like all
fondues, there are a number of
variations to choose from. One
of my favorites is made with
Gruyere and hard apple cider
(addition of brandy optional).
Sausage, sautaed whole mush-
rooms and - of course - a
baguette are all perfect accou-
trements.
Garlic Shrimp and Chicken
Breast - An easy surf 'n' turf
to prepare, chicken breast and
deveined shrimp both pair well
with a sauce of garlic, butter
and white wine. Beware, how-
ever, as both of these proteins
are easy to overcook; pay close
attention while sauteing.
Chocolate Fondue - Dark
chocolate is my preference,
but milk or white are also fine
options depending on you and
your significant other's tastes.
Fresh fruit, pretzel rods and
cubes of pound cake make fan-
tastic dippers.
And to the singles out there
(myself included), feel free to
make all of this and then imme-
diately eat every morsel. Best
part of being single, right?!

Japan, too. Osaka-based pro-
ducer Seiho

and his
diligence is paying off. He's
already a force toube reckoned
with throughout Japan's club
scene and is finally beginning

This past Tuesday, Seiho
announced a partnership with
Brooklyn-based producer
Obey City for a 4-track EP and
tour. One of those tracks is
also his latest single, "Double
Beds."
The single is a conglomera-
tion of synth licks and sound
effects, threaded together

over a sample that gives off a
Kimbra vibe. How Seiho plays
with the sample - chopping
it every which way, distorting
it to almost comical levels -
sounds like akid having too
much fun with his computer.
The eclectic mix of effects and
timbres used make you won-
der how the tune still sounds
so polished; in just four min-
utes, we get lasers, chirping*
birds, classical guitars, rev-
ving car engines, trumpets

GAMELAN
From Page lB
"The gamelan program at
the University of Michigan is
one of the oldest and most suc-
cessful gamelan programs with
ethnomusicologists in the Unit-
ed States. Judith Becker is kind
of like the mother of all modern
ethnomusicologists," Midiyan-
to said. "There are about 200
sets like this in America. And
the University of Michigan has
one of the oldest and one of the
most established gamelan pro-
grams."
Midiyanto added that only
three out of the 200 have the
rare instrument known as the
Bonang Panembung, or large
set of gong-chimes: Wesleyan,
Berkeley and Michigan.
Sitting in on one of the
gamelan ensemble's Tuesday
evening rehearsals, I under-
stood what Susan Walton
meant by saying that the music.
was more than the instrument's
mellifluous sounds; it was a
window into the humility and
egalitarianism of Javanese cul-
ture and values.
"When you learn Javanese
gamelan, it's because you want
to pacify your own mind,"
Midiyanto said. "(It's a) reflec-
tion of society; there's no one
more important than the oth-
ers. It's all equal loudness, soft-
ness. There should not be ego.in
the community. No one should
feel like 'Oh, I'm the leader.' It's
communal; it's a responsive and
interactive thing ... We just try
to be humble; as you see we sit
without chairs."
Saturday's concert will show-
case both traditional, central
Javanese music pieces and new
compositions that meld West-
ern and Eastern influences. A
dancer from the Indonesian
consulate in Chicago will also
perform a dynamic and flirta-

tious piece often seen at wed-
dings. Composer Lou Harrison,
who passed away ten years ago,
wrote a piece for the gamelan
and a viola called "Threnody"
that will be performed by a stu-
dent on her double bass.
I have a gamelan ... you have
a gamelan.
The diverse group of stu-
dents and professors who com-
prise the University's gamelan
ensemble sit cross-legged on
the regal red carpet. After a
round of music is over, they get
up and rotate to another indtru-
ment.
"To be honest there are usu-
ally separate ethnic or cul-
tural groups when performing
a world art form," said Beth
Genna, Professor of Dance His-
tory in Arts and Ideas at the
Residential College and in the
Dance Department.
Genne believes the Gamelan
Ensemble has been one of
the most diverse performing
arts groups on campus. The
gamelan attracts students from
all over Asia as well as the West.
Genn6 is a long-standing mem-
ber of the University Gamelan
and has great affection for its
deniocratic approach to music.
"It's in the culture to cooper-
ate," Genn6 said. "In the West,
it's all about competition, who's
better than the other - in this
environment, the Javanese cul-
ture stresses community. And
so it is when you're doing the
music. And then of course you
fall in love with the music and
dance - oh it's such a gorgeous
literature."
"I think there have been
generations now of students
who've learned from people like
Midi what Javanese culture is,"
Genn6 said. "It's certainly been
true for me, to really under-
stand and be connected in a
very straightforward way - a

very strong and heartfelt con-
nection because you're doing
music and dance ... It's friend-
ship. My understanding, and I
know for many of the students
that I've had, their understand-
ing of Indonesia is a personal
one. And it's through music."
Midiyanto speaks of the pow-
ers the gamelan has in fostering
peaceful relations. Even when
there were no formal diplo-
matic relations between Israel
and Indonesia, the University
of Tel Aviv prized its gamelan.
Indonesian passports warned
their holders to avoid Israel,
but it was powerless to stop the
gamelan exchange.
"It's through cultural con-
nections," Midiyanto said. "It's
nothing to do with the political
or diplomatic channel. That's

very important."
With the University's empha-
sis on internationalism, study
abroad experiences and global
partnerships, we can look at the
gamelan, which has been facili-
tating those experiences since
1965, as a model.
"I think that Mary Sue Cole-
man has initiated a program
to make the University more
international, and global, and
the gamelan has been doing
this kind of global work for
decades," Walton said. "It's a
wonderful way of bringing peo-
ple, who otherwise would have
had no interest in doing inter-
national studies, to that part of
the world. It's very successful
way of encouraging interna-
tionalism."
After playingin the gamelan or
taking one of the courses taught
by a Javanese guest artist, many
students have decided to travel to
Indonesia to study.
"One of the great opportuni-
ties of the students here has been
to be able to not only study with
people like Midiyanto, but also
to travel to Indonesia to study,"
Genn4 said. "We've had a whole
succession of students - under-
graduates and graduates - that
have gone."
I spoke with Music, Theater
& Dance junior Alexis Turner
about her experience in visiting
artist Anon Suneko's Javanese
dance class last year and her per-
formance in the Gamelan con-
cert. As part of their curriculum,
dance majors are required to take
two world dance classes. Hav-
ing already immersed herself in
Afro-Caribbean dance, Turner
decided to go for something else:
Javanese.
"I wanted to try class that had
movement that wasn't necessar-
ily on such a large scale, but was
more intricate and really focused
on elegance and gracefulness -
and something that would be out
of my element," said Turner. "It's
something that I knew I could

only get training in here; it's not
such a common form of dance ...
it's these experiences that make U
of M - you can'tjust go anywhere
and take a Javanese dance class or
go take a gamelan class."
Saturday's concert, some
worry, may be the last the Univer-
sity will enjoy in its full 69-instru-
ment gamelan splendor - at least
for a couple of years. Due to the
School of Music, Theatre and
Dance's long-needed renovation,
the gamelan will be temporarily
displaced and will find itself with
room for only about one-third of
its instruments.
"The concert in Stamps on
Feb. 15 may be the last concert of
the full gamelan that we'll ever
have at the University of Michi-
gan - we don't know," Walton
said. "We've only been promised
19 instruments. And we may not
even be able to use those. So this
is a wonderful opportunity to see
the gamelan."
Although Christopher Ken-
dall, Music, Theater & Dance
dean, expresses his support for
the gamelan and his hopes for
it to continue, there's a degree
of uncertainty with the school's
plans for the ensemble following
the construction period expected
to end around the fall of 2015.
"We have to be very, very
careful about moving forward,
because this project won't
address all of our space issues,"
Kendall said. "It's an exciting
project, but it does involve mov-
ing a number of things around
both temporarily and permanent-
ly because the building is going to
change pretty significantly. This
process is going to be disruptive
- there's no question."
"The School of Music's priori-
ties have shifted, and they have
told us that the gamelan is low on
their priority list," Walton said.
"And so they have decided to take
over the space that was specially
created for the gamelan in 1996,
and use that for piano pedagogy."
Walton continued to echo this

sentiment.
"We see a trajectory of the
gamelan," she said. "The School
of Music reducing our funding -
most of our funding - and then
the graduate student instructor
for the gamelan, we won't have
him. We no longer have the room
in the School of Music. We no lon-
ger have most of our instruments.
It's a gradual erosion of our
resources and it makes us fear for
what will happen in the future. So
that's what we're faced with."
After the construction is com-
pleted, the current gamelan prac-
tice space will not be it's home.
The dean hopes to find a better
room for it, saying he thinks the
original room was too small. But
this point does not know where
that will be.
"We don't have the solution
yet, but our effort is really to
find appropriate space for it and
hopefully it's optimal space," said
Dean Kendall. "You know obvi-
ously when you're going through
a process like this there are some
uncertainties and some disrup-
tion that can be upsetting, but I
think the intentions and plans are
very positive and supportive."
Kendall, and people such as
Walton and Genne, have men-
tioned the possibility of support
for the gamelan outside Music,
Theater & Dance. Walton hopes
that the gamelan can get into LSA
and thinks the ensemble would
be a good fit to the liberal arts
curriculum. The gamelan courses
don't just teach the music, but
emphasize the culture, history,
and interdisciplinary expression
in the traditions. She would love
for it to find a home in the Resi-
dential College - where many
of the associated workshops are
taught - but knows it too has lim-
ited space.
"I think just the main point
is, as the University is striving to
forge a more international image
of itself, the gamelan is already
here to help accomplish that
goal," Walton said.
