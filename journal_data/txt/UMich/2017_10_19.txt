After a tumultuous first 

month with racist incidents 
and controversial speakers, 
student 
governments 
on 

campus are taking steps toward 
finding possible solutions to 
amending the campus climate.

LSA senior Anushka Sarkar, 

president of Central Student 
Government, released sent an 
email Wednesday afternoon 
announcing 
the 
first 
Diag 

Assembly, in which the CSG 
body will host its Tuesday 
night meetings on the Diag.

The governing body will 

be “debating and discussing 
campus 
climate-specific 

resolutions” and there will 
be 
time 
for 
students 
to 

voice their concerns to their 
representatives. Members of 
the University of Michigan 
administration will be present.

“Our 
commitment 
to 
a 

better Michigan must start 
with 
the 
acknowledgement 

that our campus is not perfect 
— we’re not,” the email reads. 
“It’s not true to say that ‘hatred 
has no place here’ because it 
evidently does have a place 
here; as long as we are passive 
about hatred’s presence here, 
as long as we rely on the same 
people to demonstrate against 
it time and time again, hatred 
will continue to show up in our 
classes, at our doors, and on 
our street corners.”

After 
passing 
its 
own 

resolution 
to 
support 
the 

rename 
the 
C.C. 
Little 

Science Building, LSA Student 
Government 
is 
currently 

attending 
other 
meetings 

and garnering support from 
other student governments on 
campus. The LSA governing 
body started discussions on the 
renaming of the building mid-
summer. At the same time, but 
separately, an initiative started 
by History professor John 

Carson and LSA senior Joshua 
Hasler led to the creation of a 
20 page proposal on renaming 
the building. Upon learning 
this, 
LSA 
SG 
President 

Nicholas Fadanelli explained, 
decided to lobby on behalf of 
the proposal. 

The 
science 
building 
is 

named after former University 
President 
Clarence 
Cook 

Little, a known eugenicist. Last 
month, LSA SG hosted a panel 

with academics on renaming 
— the event was taken over by 
protesters wearing bloodied 
white gowns to demonstrate 
the violence of eugenics.

CSG is currently discussing 

its own resolution, introduced 
by Fadanelli and Rep. Kristen 
Ball, 
LSA 
junior, 
on 
the 

renaming of the C.C. Little 
Science Building. The body’s

Artist Mark Dion discussed 

his work “Waiting for the 
Extraordinary,” which was 
influenced by the original 
blueprint of the University of 
Michigan, Wednesday night 
at the Penny Stamps Speaker 
Series at the University of 
Michigan Museum of Art.

The event was part of 

a series and was held in 
collaboration 
between 
the 

Institute for Humanities and 
the UMMA with the goal of 
showcasing the innovation 
and art that exists across a 
wide range of disciplines. 

Dion is an internationally 

lauded artist whose work 
centers 
on 
the 
interplay 

between public institutions 
and our understanding of 
the world. Dion’s current 
installation at the Institute 
for Humanities is a restaging 
of his original work, “Waiting 
for the Extraordinary,” which 
was commissioned by the 

University in 2011.

In 
his 
lecture, 
Dion 

cited 
University 
founder 

Augustus 
Woodward 
as 

the inspiration behind the 
original piece. Dion said the 
distinctive language devised 
by Woodward to explain the 
13 disciplines he believed 
the 
University 
should 
be 

organized around caught his 
attention.

“He 
was 
absolutely 

fascinated by mixing Latin 
and Greek, as though they 
were cars approaching each 
other 60 miles an hour and 
crashing in the middle,” Dion 
said.

Amanda Krugliak, curator 

for the Institute for the 
Humanities, 
emphasized 

the sense of whimsy and 
spontaneity in Dion’s work 
while retelling her experience 
accompanying Dion on his 
initial research in 2011.

“(It was an) expedition as 

a treasure hunt,” she said.

systems and silos and rules

Bentley Historical Library maintains seal on anti-immigrant activist records

The University of Michigan 

is allegedly blocking the release 
of records donated by retired 
ophthalmologist John Tanton, 
an 
activist 
who 
opposes 

immigration 
and 
founded 

the Federation for American 
Immigration Reform, according 
to the Detroit Free Press. 
FAIR says it is a nonpartisan 
organization 
representing 

“concerned Americans” on the 

topic of immigration, while 
Tanton is considered by the 
Southern Poverty Law Center to 
be the “architect of the modern 
anti-immigrant movement.”

Beginning in 1984, Tanton 

donated 
several 
documents, 

many of which express his 
anti-immigration 
views, 
to 

the Bentley Historical Library 
at the University. However, 
only 14 of the 25 boxes he has 
donated are open to the public; 
11 are classified until 2035.

According to the Free Press, 

in December 2016 immigration 

attorney Hassan Ahmad filed 
a Freedom of Information Act 
request to gain access to the 11 
boxes; he argued the records 
should be made public seeing 
as 
Tanton’s 
anti-immigrant 

sentiments are relevant to the 
views and policies of President 
Donald Trump, which tend to 
negatively 
affectimmigrants. 

When Ahmad was denied these 
documents, he filed a lawsuit 
with the Michigan Court of 
Claims.

Ahmad told the Free Press 

it is important for the public 

to know about Tanton’s racist 
actions and the effects they 
could have on immigrants in 
the United States.

“The organizations founded 

by Dr. John Tanton are currently 
informing 
U.S. 
immigration 

policy,” Ahmad said. “I think 
the public interest is served by 
investigating the connection 
between his thought and the 
current immigration policies. 
The rise of white nationalism, 
as we’ve seen in Charlottesville, 
seem to make this all the more

The cost of building a new 

Amtrak train station at Fuller 
Park — the city of Ann Arbor’s 
preferred location for a new 
station — is about $5 million higher 
than previously thought, MLive 
reported Wednesday afternoon. 
The $5 million margin was due 
to “an arithmetic error,” the city 
stated.

The error was first noticed by 

Rita Mitchell, a member of the 
citizens group Protect A2 Parks. 
At Mitchell’s prodding, Eli Cooper, 
city 
transportation 
program 

manager, conducted a review and 
confirmed Mitchell’s finding.

The city of Ann Arbor released 

a draft environmental assessment 
report mid-September, detailing 
possible options for a new station. 
Fuller Park, which is near the 
University of Michigan Hospital, 

was named the preferred location. 
Plans for the new station included 
elevated it above the tracks 
that run past Fuller Park on the 
south side of Fuller Road. This 
preference for the new spot came 
over its current location, which is 
on Depot Street.

City Mayor Christopher Taylor 

supported the Fuller Park station 
in his 2016 year-in-review letter.

“I have previously stated my 

belief that the Fuller Road location 
would likely work best,” Taylor 
wrote last year. “It has more space 
for necessary parking, better 
access for the mass transit that will 
be necessary to move commuters 
from the station to other areas 
of the City, and it is right next to 
the highest employment center 
and most visited location in the 
County, the UM Health System.”

Protect A2 Parks, however, 

opposes the construction of a new 
station in Fuller Park because the 
construction of a new station on 

Depot Street, where the Amtrak 
Station is already located, would 
be a better use of land.

City 
Councilmember 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy, D-Ward 1, whose 
ward encompasses Fuller Park, 
was skeptical about the new 
location in a previous interview 
with the Daily. 

“People don’t ride the trains 

because there’s a new train station. 
… They take the train because the 
train is convenient,” Kailasapathy 
said. “So if additional trains are 
driving in a timely manner, at 
reasonable rates and at convenient 
times, I really don’t see the need to 
spend $81 million on a new train 
station.”

Wednesday, Cooper said the 

arithmetic error pertained to 
“an adjustment due to the time of 
construction.” In determining the 
costs for a “full-buildout scenario” 
by the year 2035, the team 
responsible for the calculations 
estimated the full cost for a Depot 

Street station is $94 million, 
$97.1 million for a ground-level 
Depot Street station and $81 for 
an elevated Fuller Park station 
plus the estimated $5 million 
more, nearing $86 million. 

That additional $5 million, 

Cooper said, would be reflected 
in an updated version of the 
draft of the environmental 
assessment report (in which the 
city announced its preference 
for a station at Fuller Park) 
before it is finalized.

Cooper 
and 
his 
team 

estimated the total cost of a 
Depot Street station ranges 
from $94 to $98 million dollars, 
and the (now updated) cost 
of a Fuller Park station would 
be $86 million. The difference 
in the estimated costs comes 
from the fact a Depot Street 
station would require widening 
the Broadway Street bridge 
and acquiring property from 
Amtrak 
and 
DTE 
Energy. 

Cooper warned, though, the 
actual costs could be up to 50 
percent higher or lower than 
these preliminary estimates.

BLOOD DRIVE

Maurice Hurst, Michigan 

football’s defensive tackle, has 
taken up a part-time job as a 
driver for Uber.

In an interview Monday 

night with “Inside Michigan 
Football,” Hurst revealed he 
occasionally does an Uber 
run when he’s not busy with 
football.

“I do it sometimes just to 

clear my head or just to enjoy 
riding and talk to someone 
that I don’t know,” Hurst said.

He drove for Uber in the 

summer of 2016, mostly for 
the extra cash and flexible 
hours. He said he has since 
enjoyed his on-and-off bouts 
with the company.

“I’m the best Uber driver 

in Ann Arbor,” Hurst said, 
later posting his 4.96-star 
rating on his Twitter account. 
“I don’t know who gave me 

a four-star, but I have 82 
five-star ratings. I get a few 
compliments. It’s something I 
really enjoy doing.”

When Michigan Coach 

Jim Harbaugh appeared 
on the show last year he 
mentioned he was driving 
his car on fumes and that he 
would potentially need a ride 
to Schembechler Hall. Hurst 
later replied to the comment 
on Twitter.

Harbaugh never did 

take Hurst up on his offer — 
probably for the best though, 
according to Hurst.

“It might be a violation,” 

he said. “I don’t know if you’re 
allowed to drive your coaches. 
I don’t think our compliance 
would be OK with that.”

SAPAC placed 400 flags on the Diag to represent sexual assault survivors Wednesday.

ourselves a big hole.”

During Saturday’s round, 

however, 
the 
Wolverines 

found the answer they needed. 
Ashley Kim, who had shot a 74 
in her initial round, rallied to 
card a six-under 66 with six 
birdies and no bogeys, moving 
her into a tie for 10th place.

“It was super impressive,” 

Dowling said. “It’s pretty rare 
to have a bogey-free round, 
and that says a lot about her 
consistency.”

Other 
Michigan 
golfers 

performed well on Saturday as 
well, including senior Kathy 
Lim who tallied a one-under 
71. Senior Emily White and 
junior Elodie Van Dievoet both 
carded scores of 75, and senior 
Megan Kim carded a 78. 

The 
Wolverines 
finished 

the second round with a one-
under 287 and moved into 
13th place. It was a significant 
improvement 
from 
their 

opening round.

“I’m proud of them for 

bouncing back the way that 
they did,” Dowling said.

Michigan continued to make 

progress during Sunday’s final 
round. Van Dievoet led the 
team with a three-under 69. 
She finished the tournament in 
43rd place with a score of 219. 
Lim shot an even 72 to finish in 
49th.

White 
and 
Megan 
Kim 

carded scores of 75 and 73 in the 
final round, finishing in 51st 
and 80th place respectively.

“We really played well the 

last two days,” Dowling said. 
“We finished well, which is 
nice.”

Ashley Kim wavered in her 

final round but still managed 
to finish in 37th with a score 
of 218. This tournament was 
another strong performance 
in 
her 
already-impressive 

freshman year.

“She’s 
playing 
on 
much 

longer golf courses that are 
set up more difficult than high 
school golf,” Dowling said. 
“For her to come out and do 
that in her first semester really 
says a lot about her talent level 
and her drive, and I think 

that’s going to give her a lot of 
confidence moving forward. … 
We are really pumped for her 
— it’s pretty great.”

The 
Wolverines 
were 

much 
more 
consistent 
in 

this outing compared to past 
tournaments. It also seemed to 
be more of a team effort, with 
different players scoring well 
throughout the weekend.

“It helps the team to know 

that there are multiple people 
that can go low,” Dowling 
said. “This time, two out of 
our three rounds were up to 
our potential. The last two 
tournaments, only one round 
was up to our potential of the 
three rounds.”

The 
field 
was 
very 

competitive 
and 
included 

powerhouses such as Duke 
and Alabama. Three other Big 
Ten teams — Iowa, Ohio State 
and Michigan State — also 
competed. It was a challenging 
test, but Michigan came to 
play.

“You gotta bring it every 

single day in the women’s 
collegiate golf world these 
days … and that’s easy to say 
and hard to do,” Dowling said. 
“ … our final two rounds should 
give us a lot of confidence that 
we can compete with some of 
the best teams in the country.”

Ashley 
Kim’s 
confidence 

showed this weekend, spurring 
the rest of the team and 
proving her legitimacy in the 
face of tough competition.

Maybe we would never have 
found what Dion was looking 
for if it hadn’t been such an 
adventure, a leap of faith and 
sometimes a cliffhanger.”

The 2011 piece featured a 

three-dimensional 
waiting 

room for Woodward’s office, 
which Dion explained had “all 
the charm of the department of 
motor vehicles.” The room was 
furnished with blue pleather 
chairs and obscure magazines. 
It was monitored by a jaded 
receptionist, uninterested in 
helping those who entered. 
Those visitors who sustained 
the seemingly endless wait 
were allowed to enter the 

office of Woodward — a dark 
room with glow-in-the-dark 
objects, each representing one 
of the 13 areas of knowledge.

the 
Bicentennial 

with 
the 
yearlong 
theme 

“Archives 
and 
Futures,” 

Dion was invited back to the 
University to restage “Waiting 
for the Extraordinary.”

The restaged piece is an 

imagination of the exterior of 
the original waiting room for 
Woodward’s office. The three-
dimensional cube is fashioned 
with wall moldings, a door, 
coat hooks and several clocks 
matching the time zones of the 
locations Dion inhabits.

Krugliak said the restaged 

piece is designed to “serve as 
an archive of the original, a 
glance back, moving forward.”

Dion then moved away from 

speaking about Ann Arbor 
in the lecture and discussed 
his 
work 
reimagining 

“follies,” which he defines 
as an 18th- or 19th-century 
building designed to produce 
a specific situation. Dion has 
created “follies” encouraging 
visitors to interact with the 
environment in destinations 
ranging from Tijuana Slough 
National Wildlife Refuge to 
the mountains of Norway.

LSA junior Julia McMahon 

attended the lecture and said 
she was captivated by the trust 
Dion has for those who enjoy 
his artwork.

“I did like how trustworthy 

he was of people,” she said. 
“I think a lot of people have a 
negative outlook of others … 
and he had a positive outlook 
on life, which I think he 
presented in his artwork.”

Leinweber said though he is 

not in a physics field, he is very 
invested in the advancement 
of 
physics 
research 
and 

knowledge.

“I’ve always been fascinated 

by 
scientific 
discoveries, 

including 
research 
around 

the 
origin 
and 
scope 
of 

the universe we exist in,” 
Leinweber said. “With this gift, 
the Leinweber family wants to 
help the University continue 
to attract talented students 
and 
provide 
faculty 
with 

enhanced resources to make 

groundbreaking 
discoveries. 

The University will also share 
their 
discoveries 
with 
the 

public 
through 
community 

engagement and outreach.” 

LSA Dean Andrew Martin 

said in the press release the 
gift 
will 
spur 
educational 

discovery and will improve 
society’s 
understanding 
of 

lesser-known physics topics.

“The Leinweber Center for 

Theoretical Physics acts as a 
discovery hub where questions 
about some of science’s most 
fascinating 
and 
complex 

questions 
are 
answered,” 

Martin said. “The foundation’s 
gift will enable researchers 
to 
better 
understand 
the 

composition of our universe 
and 
share 
exciting 
new 

knowledge with the public.”

The 
Leinweber 
Center 

researches 
physics 
and 

spreads its findings through 
conferences 
and 
seminars. 

Center 
Director 
Aaron 

Pierce said the gift from the 
foundation will bring new and 
innovative researchers to the 
University.

“The 
Leinweber 

Foundation’s gift enables the 
center to continue to promote 
excellence 
in 
theoretical 

physics,” Pierce said. “Their 
gift 
will 
be 
essential 
in 

attracting the top young talent 
to Michigan and empowering 
cutting-edge 
discoveries 

in 
exciting, 
fundamental 

directions. 
It 
also 
allows 

Michigan to remain a nexus 
for conferences and workshops 
— 
a 
place 
where 
leading 

physicists gather to discuss 
breakthroughs and generate 
new ones. We’re so grateful for 
this generous support.”

Sarkar

CSG 
Vice 

President 
Nadine 
Jawad, 
a 

Public Policy junior, released 
a 
statementreferencing 
the 

building 
after 
condemning 

Charles Murray’s views when he 
came to speak on campus. 

“For the same reasons that 

Nadine and I condemn Murray’s 
beliefs, 
Nadine 
and 
I 
also 

support the renaming of the C.C. 

Little Building,” it read. “People 
like Murray and Little, who 
shout from the rooftops that 
racism exists because certain 
people are inherently inferior do 
not deserve glorification.”

Fadanelli, an LSA senior, 

has 
expressed 
his 
concerns 

regarding the name of the 
building and how this issue has 
been previously disregarded.

“I just think it’s appalling 

to have this mixed message,” 
he explained. “On the one 
hand having the University, 
which tells its students, ‘You 
belong here,’ and on the other 

hand having in one of the most 
prominent locations on campus 
… a building that glorifies a man 
who believed that a majority of 
students do not belong here.”

LSA SG has reached out to the 

administration and to the student 
governments representing other 
schools within the University. 
Fadanelli expressed gratitude 
for the amount of support from 
the student governments and 
the University, especially within 
LSA.

“I cannot state enough how 

much I appreciate what the 
college of LSA administration 

and faculty have done so far on 
this issue,” Fadanelli said.

Fadanelli and LSA senior Ryan 

Gillcrist, LSA SG Vice President 
met with University President 
Mark Schlissel’s special council 
last 
week. 
They 
discussed 

President Schlissel’s new system 
of renaming buildings and how 
they are learning to amend and 
improve the process along the 
way. They also touched on how 
to make the administration’s 
actions and proposals more 
transparent and accessible to 
students.

“They 
have 
been 
very 

amicable in terms of being as 
transparent, open and honest as 
they can be,” Fadanelli said.

In addition to the science 

building 
proposal, 
the 

administration 
is 
also 

considering renaming Winchell 
House in West Quad Residence 
Hall, as Winchell’s work has been 
cited by white supremacists. 

Fadanelli also brought up 

the renaming intiative during 
University Council. He said he 
stopped by Engineering Student 
Government’s 
meeting 
to 

propose a renaming resolution to 
their assemblies. He explained 

there was a lot of “verbal 
support” from the other student 
governing bodies. During his 
discussion with ESG, he said its 
president, Engineering senior 
Breanna DeCocker, was very 
open to discussion. ESG is voting 
on their resolution Wednesday 
night.

important. … It’s important 
for us to be aware of how his 
thought may be poisoning our 
policies.”

Ahmad 
said 
the 
closed 

records include FAIR’s meeting 
minutes, 
Tanton’s 
private 

correspondence and folders 
addressing 
immigration, 

among other documents.

In 
an 
interview, 
Terry 

McDonald, director of the 
Bentley Library, explained the 
library has 11,000 collections. 
About 6,000 have been given by 
individuals, while the rest have 
been provided by University 
units and departments.

McDonald said it is not 

unusual to have a conversation 
with a donor about when the 
contents of his or her donation 
will be made public.

“When 
an 
individual 
is 

giving you their collection, 
especially if it involves their 
own lifetime, they frequently 
ask about the possibility of 
the collection being closed 
for some period of time, and 
they’re usually thinking about 
the people that they interacted 
with, that sort of thing, kind 
of not being around when this 
opens,” he said. “It’s a pretty 
standard 
conversation 
with 

an individual donor of private 
papers 
or 
their 
personal 

archive 
about 
whether 
or 

not they want it to be open 
immediately, or open at some 
point in the future.”

McDonald 
said 
certain 

collections have restrictions. 

“This is not about Tanton, 

this is about a pretty common 
conversation that we have with 

donors when they think about 
or agree to giving us their 
collections … exactly when will 
this open,” he said. 

McDonald highlighted the 

14 public boxes have been used 
for research.

“A substantial portion of the 

collection is open and has been 
used by researchers, and has 
been used by the researchers 
that 
are 
unfavorable 
to 

(Tanton),” McDonald said. “So 
it’s not as though you can’t use 
this at all.”

McDonald said the library 

has also been collecting and 
archiving 
the 
websites 
of 

Tanton’s organizations; these 
archives are accessible online.

He also explained the legal 

issue at hand is whether a 
public university can make 
such commitment to a donor to 
keep their documents private.

“That’s actually a pretty 

significant 
question 
for 

archives at all the public 
universities, 
because, 

of 
course, 
it’s 
standard 

professional practice to have 
this conversation,” he said. 
“Our desire is always to have 
things open ultimately, but in 
some cases in order to have 
that open over some length 
of time we will agree to have 
it closed for some period of 
time.”

McDonald said the library 

takes no position on Tanton, 
his causes or the content of the 
collection; he said the library 
will maintain the agreement 
unless they are asked to do 
otherwise by the University or 
the court.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald wrote in an email 
there is not much information 
to share given the lawsuit.

“It is important to note that 

many of the papers are already 
available through the Bentley 
Library and others will be 
available at a later date, under 
the terms of the gift agreement 
with the donor,” Fitzgerald 
wrote.

U

niversity of Michigan 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
has 
always 

said the right things 
about the value of a 
liberal arts education. 
In 2015, he said that a 
liberal arts education 
“prepares students to 
lead in increasingly 
multicultural 
workplaces 
and 

community 
environments.” 
He 

has 
since 
echoed 

those remarks, stating 
at a meeting with 
student leaders at the University 
of Michigan’s Dearborn campus 
in 2016 that “the toolbox of the 
humanities is really essential for 
every educated person.” 

Schlissel’s 
explicit 
support 

recognizes 
the 
University’s 

proud history and strength in 
its liberal arts curriculum. More 
than 40 LSA programs rank in 
the top 10 nationally, and the LSA 
faculty reads like a who’s who in 
academia, with two professors in 
LSA receiving MacArthur genius 
grants just last week. 

On paper, the University can 

certainly lay claim to being 
a 
liberal 
arts 
powerhouse. 

In 
practice, 
though, 
LSA 

increasingly seems to defer 
to 
the 
undergraduate 
pre-

professional 
schools 
at 
the 

University, 
whether 
through 

funding, attention or general 
caretaking. 
Facilities 
and 

classrooms 
primarily 
used 

for liberal arts studies appear 
antiquated next to those in the 
Ross School of Business and the 
Ford School of Public Policy. 
Advisory services and activities 
to promote a sense of community 
for students in LSA also lag 
behind the intimate networks 
created by those schools.

These 
deficiencies 
do 
not 

reflect a lack of commitment by 
the University staff and faculty. 
A student seeking help from a 
professor undoubtedly will receive 
assistance from the best minds 
anywhere on campus. 

Where the University stumbles, 

however, is the disproportionate 
attention seemingly given to 
developing 
communities 
and 

networks 
in 
its 
professional 

schools at the expense of its 
liberal arts program. 

This need not and 

should 
not 
be 
the 

case. LSA’s reputation 
as a leading liberal 
arts 
program 
is 

well-deserved 
and 

must 
be 
supported. 

A 
Pew 
Research 

Center 
survey 
of 

1,408 
technologists, 

practitioners 
and 

education 
leaders 

concluded 
that 
the 

most 
important 

skills in a rapidly automating job 
market will be those that are more 
irreplaceable and intangible, like 
creativity, curiosity and empathy.

Contrary to some current 

thinking, the liberal arts should 
not be and, in fact, are not seen 
as a luxury reserved for affluent 
students, either. One survey of 
5,000 graduating seniors found 
that the students most likely 
to major in the humanities or 
social sciences were the first 
in their family to have earned 
college degrees.

No single remedy exists to shift 

focus away from more specialized 
pre-professional 
schools, 
but 

the University has many tools 
to promote the liberal arts and 
preserve LSA’s reputation. Here 
are some straightforward steps the 
University can take:

1. Court more donors for 

liberal 
arts 
scholarships. 
The 

fruits of liberal arts are so widely 
appreciated in disciplines beyond 
humanities that even those who 
have endowed schools at the 
University can surely be persuaded 
to 
support 
multidisciplinary 

education. After all, two of the 
University’s 10 largest donations in 
school history have partially gone 
toward liberal arts studies and a 
third, a $50 million gift from Helen 
Zell for the Helen Zell Writers’ 
Program, was earmarked solely 
for the liberal arts, albeit in the 
graduate program.

2. 
Invest 
in 
improved 

classrooms in liberal arts buildings. 
Students who view their classroom 
environments as supportive and 
positive tend to learn better. The 
University is taking the right steps 

with renovation plans for Weiser 
Hall and the LSA Building, but two 
of the biggest hubs for the liberal 
arts — the Modern Languages 
Building and Mason Hall — would 
benefit from more modernized 
classrooms. 
No 
significant 

renovations have been made in 
the Modern Languages Building 
since its construction in 1972. 
Only one major renovation, a $35 
million project completed in 2003, 
has been made in Haven Hall and 
Mason Hall in the past 65 years. In 
comparison, there has been $292 
million in projects for the Business 
School since 2004.

3. Make cohorts and mentorship 

within LSA and liberal arts 
programs 
more 
visible. 
Peer 

mentorship lets students serve as 
advisers to one another and in turn 
tempers the scale of a school as vast 
as LSA. While many departments 
have peer advisers, not many 
students 
know 
about 
these 

resources. The Business School has 
successfully adopted similar forms 
of peer mentorship.

4. 
Better 
publicize 

extracurricular 
opportunities 

related to the liberal arts. A more 
accessible and dynamic website 
advertising 
undergraduate 

journals, internships and research 
opportunities 
would 
increase 

student involvement on campus. 
The LSA Opportunity Hub is a 
big step in the right direction. 
Increasing awareness of similar 
initiatives would further elevate 
our liberal arts program.

5. 
Encourage 
students 

enrolled 
in 
pre-professional 

schools to pursue interests 
they have in the liberal arts. 
Business leaders as diverse 
as Mark Cuban and Slack’s 
Stewart 
Butterfield 
have 

championed the values of a 
liberal arts education. Campus 
participation in a liberal arts 
education 
should 
extend 

past 
requirements 
typically 

completed 
in 
a 
student’s 

freshman year. As President 
Schlissel has said, “A liberal 
education teaches citizenship.”

W

here 
is 
the 
line 

between productive 
debate 
and 

dangerous discourse?

At what point do 

we, as the collective 
public, 
identify 

specific 
“speech” 

as 
blatantly 
racist 

rhetoric that is not 
meant to be discussed 
or 
debated, 
but 

instead only meant to 
inspire and amplify 
the message to the 
future followers of 
modern-day 
fascists 

who endanger our democracy?

Last week, several of our fellow 

students decided that a speaker 
invited by the University’s chapter 
of College Republicans was exactly 
that — a racist whose speech would 
do nothing other than poison 
the minds of tepid followers and 
further endanger the rights and 
lives of minorities on campus.

And to be clear, Charles 

Murray and his bestseller, “The 
Bell Curve,” are on the wrong 
side of history. His academic 
work provides racists with an 
actual source on which to base 
their ignorant and disgusting 
claims. But attempting to silence 
anything this man had to say 
was ultimately a detriment to 
the cause of winning the literal 
culture war we seem to be 
descending into as a country.

Aside from the blatant disregard 

of the very right of freedom of 
speech on public universities that 
protesters, professors and myself 
so easily engage in, these actions 
have undeniably further pushed a 
segment of Americans away from 
us and our ideas.

As 
students 
of 
this 
elite 

university, we are some of the most 
intelligent, active, informed and 
well-connected members of our 
generation; thousands of us will 
most definitely go on to change 
our society for the better. Yet it is 
actions like this that automatically 
disengage 
and 
distance 
a 

demographic of the population 
that we need.

Capturing that demographic 

wins us more than electoral 
victories. If we truly want to 

change this country, 
if we actually want 
to be the progressive 
generation 
that 

advances 
American 

society 
past 
this 

hellish 
episode 
of 

our history, we need 
to convey our liberal 
and 
progressive 

concepts to a segment 
of the United States 
we 
have 
become 

openly hostile to.

Because there are individuals 

who regret voting for Trump. 
There are Republican, right-
leaning and moderate Americans 
who are looking at the lunacy 
of 
this 
administration 
and 

understanding there may be a 
need for a rational response to the 
nationalistic and ignorant policies 
that are plaguing this nation.

We’re on the right side 

of history; we just need to 
communicate to the others why.

But instead of that, we lock 

ourselves 
away 
within 
our 

cities and strike “invaders” with 
silencing 
attacks, 
drowning 

them out as the equivalent to 
the Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan. 
We further entrench ourselves 
within these operating bases that 
are found within the most liberal 
echo chambers of major cities 
and college towns, continuing to 
bounce the same condemnations 
of the lunacy of Trump and all 
those who voted for him off one 
another, doing nothing to engage 
those who may even disagree in 
the slightest.

Last 
week, 
the 
protesters 

served as an example of that. But 
again, to be clear, Charles Murray 
is a moron. His blatantly racist 
writings are disgusting. Yet in the 
totality of the spectrum of this 
ideological struggle, silencing 
this man was no victory, for it only 
added ammunition to the Tucker 
Carlsons of the United States who 
will go on to exploit this and drive 
the wedge of division further.

Because the protesters, our 

fellow students, will be painted in 
very broad and factually incorrect 
strokes. Their actions will add 
to the many other instances that 
craft this false narrative of the 
uncompromising, liberal, coddled, 
safe 
space-having, 
triggered, 

antifa-supporting 
millennial 

population that is going to destroy 
the country. If only we could send 
our generation to fight a couple 
world wars, maybe we would 
toughen up and stop caring about 
our “feelings.”

The students who protested are 

none of those things, though. They 
are overwhelmed. Donald Trump, 
a dotty old racist, is president. He 
is so incapable of doing his job, 
it’s not even worth the column 
space to write about anymore. 
The literal open displays of racism 
occurring within the country are 
alarming — so it is understandable 
that a reaction to a speaker such as 
this occurred.

Yet again, it ultimately will 

add to our loss in bringing more 
Americans onto our side.

As Murray said about the event, 

“This was being streamed tonight, 
right? The number of people who 
are going to see what went on there 
and are going to be moved further 
right compared to the number of 
people who saw that and say, ‘Oh 
that’s great, this is what we want’ 
— and there’s asymmetry there.”

“This is what we want.”
I recognize I am writing this 

from a position of privilege, 
but I must stress that I believe 
there is no merit in granting 
these idiots what they want — 
for us to react in this silencing, 
oppressive manner.

Attacking and silencing this 

moronic old racist that a handful 
of mini-Paul Ryans wanted to 
hear last week strategically may 
not have been the best course of 
action. The far-right has more 
ammunition now, and it will 
distort, warp and exploit this for 
as long as possible.

Being “Transparent” in social justice

LEVI TEITEL | COLUMN

I

n the finale of the third season 
of Amazon’s “Transparent,” 
the 
Pfefferman 
family 

goes aboard a cruise ship during 
the Jewish holiday of Passover. 
Traditionally 
during 
Passover 

seders, Jews recite the religious 
platitude “next year in Jerusalem” 
to mark the thousand-year longing 
to return to the land of Israel. 
Perhaps not coincidentally, season 
four of “Transparent” does just 
that: Maura, the matriarch and 
protagonist of the series, presents a 
lecture on gender, Judaism and the 
Cold War in Tel Aviv with daughter 
Ali in tow.

As 
gender 
and 
Judaism 

continue 
to 
be 
preeminent 

themes in “Transparent,” this 
season 
the 
characters 
also 

struggle to balance tradition 
and evolving mores. The new 
season, released in the midst 
of the High Holy Days, is 
fitting for inner observation 
of collective and individual 
behavior. In a time of major 
social upheaval, “Transparent” 
helps us deconstruct the walls 
that divide us.

In the era of identity politics, 

what exactly does it mean to be 
Jewish? How do different social 
positions either reinforce or nullify 
certain axes of oppression? These 
relevant questions reveal the nexus 
of spirituality, political power and 
social consciousness. As students 
come to grips with mounting anti-
Semitism, racism and Islamophobia 
on college campuses, such moral 
and 
emotional 
predicaments 

become even more pressing. 

Against the backdrop of the 

Arab-Israeli 
conflict, 
these 

complexities illustrate how the 
Pfeffermans react to these schisms 
ingrained in their psyches. First, let 
me explain the history necessary 
to understand this season. In 
 

“Land and Power,” Anita Shapira 
describes the paradigmatic shift 
in Zionist art and literature 
during the late 19th century and 
the first half of the 20th century. 
After 
hundreds 
of 
years 
of 

persecution and marginalization, 
Zionist leaders forged a new 
mythology 
and 
an 
archetype 

to reimagine Jewishness. The 
“new Jew” was a male, muscular, 
strong-willed 
individual 
who 

contributed productively to the 
national community. This stood 
in opposition to the diasporic Jew: 
weak, dependent and emasculate.

As Shapira notes, what marked 

men passing from the diaspora to 

the Israeli community in literary 
texts was his integration with 
the kibbutz, a space where hard 
work and collectivism shaped his 
milieu. The same representation 
of gender and masculinity in the 
diaspora and national Jewish 
communities still plays out in the 
mythologies of mass culture today, 
as demonstrated in “Transparent.”

Jill Soloway, the creator of 

“Transparent,” both challenges 
and feeds into this overplayed 
mythology. 
Soloway 
makes 

viewers question the histories 
and emotions that bind humans 
together. Borders and binarisms 
that separate — whether they are 
psychological or physical — are 
inconsequential insofar as they 
uphold the existing structure and 
authority that first erected them. 
How entrenched these separations 
are is irrespective of the fact that 
they once were manufactured. 

By moving to Israel, Moshe, 

Maura’s 
long-lost 
father, 
was 

able to reclaim his masculinity. 
Juxtaposed alongside the non-
Israeli branch of the Pfefferman 
family, 
American 
Jewish 

masculinity operates in a very 
different way. When the family’s 
Israeli 
security 
detail 
cajoles 

Maura’s son Josh into shooting a 
gun — an object so ubiquitous in 
Israel — for the very first time, he 
nearly shoots his mother. This is 
a sign of his personal deficiencies 
and insecurities, both a result of his 
disorienting upbringing.

However, the most nuanced 

and 
provoking 
representation 

of Jewish and gender identities 
this season comes from Ali, 
the youngest of Maura’s three 
children. 
Ali 
embodies 
the 

growing young Jewish sentiment 
that questions the legitimacy of 
the establishment. 

Ali’s 
gender-bending 

performance at the Western Wall 
is one such example this season. 
Ali’s transgression is indicative of 
a larger attitude of alienation and 
inquisitiveness. Struggling with 
what it means to simultaneously 
act independently and belong to a 
larger community is a quandary 
not unique to Ali, but reflective 
of where many Jews stand today. 
Faced 
with 
representational 

and spiritual exclusion, Jews 
are 
increasingly 
creating 

alternative community spaces. 
College students specifically are 
forging alliances with other faith 
communities for mutual cultural 
understanding and solidarity.

Between family in Tel Aviv and 

friends in Ramallah, Palestine, 
Ali learns about politics from 
a different vantage point. Ali’s 
political 
realization 
coincides 

with another revelation — that of 
nonconforming to gender. Both 
Jews and Muslims claim the 
Temple Mount — one of the most 
contested sites of the conflict — as 
theirs for religious significance. 
As Ali scoffs at the comparatively 
smaller 
portion 
women 
are 

allotted at the Western Wall, they 
covertly put on a yarmulke and 
walk over to the men’s section. 
Their persistent questioning of 
the status quo impels a dialectic 
negotiating 
between 
multiple 

identities: 
woman, 
nonbinary, 

Jewish, American, ally.

Soloway, who also came out 

as 
nonbinary 
this 
summer, 

views the political ecology of 
this season through the lens 
of intersectionality. As they 
recently explained to Vulture, 
“One of the meaning (sic) of 
intersectionality is that even if 
I wanted to choose between my 
queerness and my Jewishness, 
I wouldn’t, I couldn’t.” Placing 
the 
friction 
brought 
upon 

gender identity issues alongside 
this 
more-than-70-year 

sociopolitical context begs the 
question: How did we arrive at 
this moment?

During 
the 
Jewish 
High 

Holy Days, the inclination for 
introspection summons feelings 
of remorse and improvement. 
Coming together as a community 
is integral to understanding how 
to put the concerns and needs 
of others in mind. Reaching an 
equilibrium helps us move beyond 
rigid preconceptions and see things 
for what they truly are, not as what 
they should be.

While issues of social injustice 

maintain their place within the 
public’s 
consciousness, 
college 

students 
must 
utilize 
their 

position to reinvigorate modes 
of critical inquiry. It needn’t 
be obligatory for everyone to 
be gender studies scholars like 
Maura and Ali to engage in the 
discourse 
surrounding 
social 

issues. 
To 
recognize 
one’s 

place as an individual within 
a larger community is enough 
to conceptualize how close we 
actually are.

‘Last Flag Flying’ is one of the many films playing at Chicago Film Festival this month
At Chicago International 
Film Festival, Day 2: ‘12 
Days’ & ‘Last Flag Flying’

Daniel Hensel continues his daily updates this week from Chicago

“12 Days,” a documentary by 

French filmmaker Raymond 
Depardon 
(“Journal 
de 

France”), is a bore. Even at 
under 90 minutes, the film 
feels like a painful marathon. 
In “12 Days,” Depardon trains 
his eye on an odd quirk of the 
French legal system: When 
an individual is brought into 
a 
psychiatric 
ward, 
likely 

against his or her will, after 12 
days the individual is brought 
before a judge, who determines 
whether the inmate will stay or 
will be released. “12 Days” is 
largely restricted to capturing 
the proceedings of these semi-
trials.

In these interviews, the 

patients 
remain 
closed, 
or 

more rarely open up. They 
may 
be 
confessional, 
they 

may lie. Each patient is given 
an 
anonymity 
that 
cloaks 

his or her true feelings. But 
this is a psychiatric ward, 
after all. After we hear one 
patient ramble about being 
a part of the holy trinity, 
the judge mentions that he 
had 
murdered 
his 
father. 

Depardon’s 
documentary 

invites viewers to question the 
desirability, let alone legality, 
of a system that ostensibly lets 
its captives determine their 
fate, while allowing a largely 
removed judge to ultimately 
make the call. Some cases are 
open and shut, one or two in 
particular are heartbreaking. 
A few have rather grisly and 
painful details.

But while the film’s subject 

matter 
and 
the 
questions 

about civil liberties it raises 
are vital, Depardon can’t rely 
on topicality alone to create 
a 
compelling 
film. 
Each 

interview 
session, 
through 

editing, lasts around seven 
minutes, but many feel like an 
eternity. We hear a modestly 
made plea, a great deal of 
incoherence, a summary from 
a lawyer and a reliably sober 
judge’s decision. Monotonous 
and languorous, “12 Days” 
lays the foundation for critical 
non-fiction work but forgets 
to make it interesting. Other 
direct cinema documentaries 
of the sort, such as Frederick 
Wiseman’s latest masterwork, 
“Ex Libris,” mine a large 
collection 
of 
footage 
for 

the best material. It seems 
Depardon only shot 87 minutes 
of film and cut nothing.

Though it doesn’t justify 

sitting 
down 
for 
the 
full 

87 
minutes, 
three 
almost 

otherwise 
silent 
interludes, 

scored 
by 
Oscar-winner 

Alexandre 
Desplat 
(“The 

Grand Budapest Hotel”) are 

splendid and almost poetic in 
their minimalism. Depardon, 
after a number of interviews, 
looks to the facility’s grounds 
outdoors to see a man, not quite 
lost but certainly confused, 
walking in circles; toward the 
end he examines the entryway 
to a store and the rolling grass 
of the facility’s main square; 
after the last interview, he 
captures 
a 
gorgeous 
mist-

laden twilight. Desplat’s score, 
which unfortunately only plays 
in these scenes, is haunting, 
composed mostly of despair but 
with a tinge of hope and uplift, 

like the facility’s inmates.

The first American film 

I saw at the Festival, aside 
from “The Florida Project,” 
which wasn’t playing at the 
Festival but was playing at 
the same theater, was “Last 
Flag Flying,” a follow-up to 
“The Last Detail,” a 1973 film 
directed by Hal Ashby. In 
“The Last Detail,” two men 
in the Navy (played by Jack 
Nicholson and Otis Young) 
are tasked with escorting a 
much younger third (played 
by Randy Quaid) to a Navy 
prison to serve an eight-year 
sentence for petty theft. Given 
a per diem and seven days to 
make a four-day trip, the two 
sailors plan on spending much 
of their money and time on 
the way back. But when they 
start to develop a liking for the 
young shipman, they decide to, 
in their parlance, show him a 
good time.

A follow-up, based on a 

2005 novel written by Darryl 
Ponicsan, the same author 
as 
the 
first 
film’s 
source 

material, makes perfect sense 
for director Richard Linklater. 
“The Last Detail” is a sort of 
proto-Linklater hang movie, 
akin to “Dazed and Confused” 
and last year’s “Everybody 
Wants Some!!,” and who better 
than Linklater, whose “Before” 
trilogy and “Boyhood” capture 
aging and passing time better 
than any other director, to pick 

up the trio’s story.

Unfortunately, 
Linklater’s 

latest lacks much of the charm 
of his other movies and the 
original 1973 film. Granted, 
“Last Flag Flying” is much 
more mournful because of its 
general plot, but its attempts at 
comedy aren’t nearly as potent. 
Sure some laughs land, but this 
a largely sterile film, focused 
on artificially creating a plot 
where one perhaps shouldn’t 
exist.

“Last Flag Flying” takes 

place in the Northeast U.S., just 
like its predecessor, this time 
with the backdrop of another 
conflict that has since come 
to be understood as a foolish 
quagmire. The names have 
changed, as has their backstory, 
but a trio reunites. Early in 
the Iraq War, Larry “Doc” 
Shepherd (Steve Carell, “Battle 
of the Sexes”), who continues 
Quaid’s character, drops in 
on bartender Sal Nealon (a 
Jack Nicholson-impersonating 
Bryan Cranston, “Trumbo”) 
and 
Reverend 
Richard 

Mueller (Otis Young incarnate 
Laurence 
Fishburne, 
“John 

Wick Vol. 2”). Doc’s son, Larry, 
was killed in Iraq and he wants 
Nealon and Mueller, all of 
whom haven’t seen each other 
since their days in Vietnam, to 
accompany him to the funeral.

The Marines plan on burying 

Larry at Arlington, but Doc has 
other plans, eyeing to bury his 
son in Portsmouth, NH, where 
he lived and where Doc’s 
recently deceased wife is also 
buried. The trio conspires to 
outwit the Marines and, in the 
process, bump up against each 
other, reminiscing and arguing 
as old friends might do. 

Where the film stumbles, 

besides 
some 
of 
its 

uncharacteristically 
stale 

dialogue, is its odd attempt 
to distance itself from the 
original 
film 
while 
still 

holding tightly to its premise. 
In my recollection, Vietnam 
is not even mentioned in “The 
Last Detail,” but the Iraqi 
undercurrent in “Last Flag 
Flying” 
almost 
necessitates 

the comparison, but it feels 
artificial. The name changes 
and 
the 
variation 
in 
the 

backstory 
are 
somewhat 

perplexing 
and 
definitely 

jarring. A crucial emotional 
moment in the film involving 
Cicely Tyson (“The Help”) 
feels very forced.

Cranston 
and 
Fishburne 

appear uncomfortable in their 
roles and play exaggerated 
archetypes, but Carell is simply 
incredible. He’s a defeated 
man, between his time in the 
brig and the two deaths in the 
past year, so when he’s finally 
able to laugh, it’s an outburst of 
melancholic catharsis.

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
Edgefest to bring vibrant 
musical talent to campus 

Ann Arbor’s annual jazz festival returns this week to Kerrytown

The soul of the saxophone, 

the 
pounding 
of 
percussion, 

the mellow of the cello — these 
sounds blend into a traveling 
tune, dancing through the air to 
the ears of the crowd. Edgefest, 
the four day festival of avant-
garde music, features a plethora 
of world-renowned artists, each a 
master of their own form of music. 
Ground-breaking 
musicians, 

influenced by jazz, rock and 
classical, are bringing innovative 
and 
improvised 
melodies 
to 

the Kerrytown Concert House 
this 
weekend. 
With 
several 

performances 
throughout 
the 

evening each day, there are plenty 
opportunities to make time for 
musical talents that radiate with 
passion and expertise. 

Founded in 1997, Edgefest 

started as a one-day festival that 
quickly grew into its present four-
day celebration. It began when two 
exceptional groups of musicians 
happened to come through town 
at the same time. Dave Lynch had 
the thought to simply add another 
group and turn it into a festival; 
thus, Edgefest was born.

It’s the year of percussion. Every 

year, the festival rallies around a 
theme to tie it all together, such 
as bass or saxophone in years 
past. This year, the musicians 
are connected by their mastery 
in percussion. The festival will 
illuminate the ingenious role of 
drummers within the avant world 
of music. The badum tish, the 
gada gada, the groans and moans, 
the jars, even the rataplan: all the 
beats to shake your senses and lull 

you into the rhythm of the drum.

The community of Ann Arbor 

clamors with anticipation over 
this 
valued 
attraction 
each 

year. In an interview with the 
Daily, Deanna Relyea, founder 
of Kerrytown Concert House in 
1984, said Edgefest is “really one of 
the most important festivals of its 
kind in the world.” Nowhere else 
can you hear the same exceptional 
gathering of music. 

“You don’t get thousands of 

people stampeding the stage,” 
Relyea said. “It’s a 
very specific music, 
yet it’s a mixture: 
some improvised, 
some composed.”

This isn’t the 

music 
you 
hear 

on the radio. This 
music 
is 
real, 

requires 
talent 

and 
actually 

means something. 
The typical jazz 
instruments 
will be featured 
as well as some 
atypical 
cultural 

instruments 
and 

some cutting-edge 
electric appliances 
— it is wholly unusual. Instead of 
the songs being rehearsed ahead 
of time, you will be faced with 
on-the-spot melodies, tunes that 
come right from the heat of the 
moment. 

That’s what makes this music 

special — what you hear in that 
moment will not be heard in the 
same way again. A night spent 
at Edgefest is a night unique and 
truly your own. 

“I feel that young minds grasp 

the roots of this music,” Relyea 

said.

With a student population 

from all over the world, the bright 
minds of Michigan’s community 
are perfectly suited to Edgefest. 
Many of this year’s artists are 
from New York, San Francisco and 
Europe; students from those areas 
will probably recognize some of 
the names of the artists.

“We are happy when the house 

is full — at 120 people,” Relyea 
said about KCH’s attendance. 
“That’s the way it is in New York 

too. People playing 
in 
downtown 

Manhattan, 
with 

rave reviews by the 
New York Times, 
are happy to get 
40 people.” During 
Edgefest, however, 
the 
house 
often 

finds itself sold out 
with the popularity 
of the festival. Each 
act is different; it’s 
original. There is 
no headliner act. 
Instead, all groups 
are well known in 
their musical field, 
and 
it 
becomes 

a 
collaborative 

environment among musicians.

Too often does this genre get 

over looked by the millennial’s 
obsession with pop culture and 
what’s “cool.” Jazz is not an old 
form of music, but a genre that is 
continually developing, reshaping 
and adapting with the times. If you 
think jazz can’t create a charged, 
electric feel, you are wrong. If 
you think jazz can’t rock the 
house down, you are wrong. If you 
think jazz is dead, you are most 
definitely wrong.

How do you say “dvsn”?
dvsn’s sophomore album 
is Very Good, if not Great

For most of the 2000s, Mark 

Buehrle was a well above-average 
baseball 
player. 
Known 
for 

excellent pitch location, killer off-
speed stuff and refreshingly fast 
pace on the mound, the White 
Sox left-hander earned five All 
Star nods in addition to a World 
Series championship in 2005. He 
was good — very good — but not 
quite legendary, and although 
he’ll always be a fan favorite in 
Chicago, he’ll forever be cemented 
in baseball purgatory, an area one 
notch down from Fame: the Hall of 
Very Good.

On Oct. 13, dvsn released 

Morning 
After, 
a 
sophomore 

follow-up to 2016’s Sept. 5th, and if 
that debut was Buehrle’s no-hitter, 
this is his perfect game — better 
refined, likely more memorable, 
a more successful push beyond 
minimalistic stricture and another 
accolade to tack onto — at best — a 
very above-average career.

On that debut we got gems 

(e.g. “With Me,” “Too Deep”) that 
oozed, simply and unapologetically, 
of sex, and the theme is also in 
effect here. This time, the duo — 
one half Daniel Daley (vocals) and 
other half Nineteen85 (production) 
— feels more comfortable toying 
with this sexual foundation. While 
standard alternative R&B elements 
are noticeable, “Don’t Choose,” for 
example, adds something extra 

with its muffled, pitchy hook. We 
hear a plea, of sorts, and it leads 
up to an especially gospel-y outro 
that’s equal parts unexpected and 
fun (and maybe the highlight). 
This moment smoothly transitions 
to “Mood,” an airy piano carrying 
into Daley’s boldest falsettos on 
the entire album, which sets the 
scene for a lush ballad. Consider 
this stretch equivalent to Buehrle’s 
time 
with 
the 

Toronto Blue Jays, 
the city from where 
dvsn 
themselves 

hail; 
the 
pitcher 

saw success with a 
new level of finesse 
in the twilight of 
his career as he 
played with speeds and spots. 
Similarly, dvsn mixes in refreshing 
instrumentation to stabilize each 
ballad.

The album as a whole is 

a 
ballad, 
after 
all. 
Certain 

straightforwardness 
is 
to 
be 

expected; Morning After contains 
13 
tracks, 
each 
grounded 

thematically in love and the 
frustrations that stem from it. 
The songs that stand out are those 
where 
the 
production 
falters 

for one reason or another: “Nuh 
Time / Tek Time” relies on an 
underwhelming beat switch, while 
“Claim” utilizes too much mid-
2000s sounding synth. Both tracks 
quickly become forgettable.

dvsn finds itself tiptoeing a 

tight line because it still excels 
in a certain comfortable alt-R&B 

space. It’s natural to look for more 
a second time around, but the duo 
realistically can only function as its 
most organic self, an inextricably 
OVO-inked, 
Toronto-linked, 

Drake-child of crooning output. 
Accepting this makes a track like 
“Think About Me” that much 
better, even if it feels conservative 
in light of other recent Nineteen85 
beauties 
like 
PartyNextDoor’s 

“Not 
Nice” 
or 

Drake’s 
“Madiba 

Riddim.”

Morning 
After 

is 
simultaneously 

a 
high 
quality 

release that also 
falls victim to the 
inescapability 
of 

its own cadre of love-oriented 
artists and fellow collaborators 
— 
PartyNextDoor 
and 
Majid 

Jordan come to mind — and it 
ultimately defines the release. 
“Conversations in a Diner” might 
be the best example of this, a 
back-end 
choral 
reinforcement 

providing an extra punch on a 
track that still somehow ends up 
sounding familiar. There’s a very 
real ceiling here, and it becomes 
increasingly curious if / when it 
can grow. Buehrle never really had 
that moment — he was really good, 
an incredibly satisfying form of 
entertainment, and yet, due to the 
nature of his own game, maybe 
not the realest thing. The analogy 
resonates here, especially in light 
of its latest release. Welcome, dvsn, 
to the Hall of Very Good.

Goldlink performed at St. Andrew’s last Tuesday
A nonchalant, undeniably 
hype GoldLink electrifies

Before even showing his face 

on stage, D.C. rapper D’Anthony 
Carlos (more commonly known 
by 
stage 
name, 
GoldLink) 

captivated the audience. Hidden 
from view on the sidelines, 
his voice bounced around the 
expanse of St. Andrew’s Hall as he 
shouted expletives that mingled 
with colorful strobe lights. By the 
time he graced the audience with 
his presence, casually strolling 
out with a grin and a puffy jacket, 
the crowd was in an uproar. 
Armed with only a microphone 
in one hand, GoldLink struck an 
unassuming figure against the 
clamoring backdrop of red, blue 
and yellow.

Five minutes later, jacket lying 

forgotten in the back corner, 
crowd dissolving into a pit of 
thrashing arms and bouncing 
feet, 
“unassuming” 
(and 
all 

other associated synonyms) was 
nowhere to be found.

Ricocheting from one beat to 

the next, never faltering in speed 
or energy, GoldLink proved his 
solo presence as a force to be 
reckoned with. The layering 
of smooth rap over a playful 
menagerie of melodies turned 
the small corner of Detroit into lit 
fireworks. 

With songs that pull inspiration 

from a wide range of sources — 
everything from house to soul — 
GoldLink was unapologetically 
uncontained as he constructed 
his rolling patchwork of sound.

Unapologetically uncontained 

seemed to be the theme of the 
show, as even the opener, Masego, 
blended styles of music in a 
similar fashion. Bursting on to the 
stage in crooked sunglasses and a 
miniature saxophone necklace 
matching the actual saxophone 
in his right hand, Masego’s 
lighthearted demeanor welcomed 
all. Easygoing and laidback, he 
danced from one song to the next, 
each its own intricate tie-dye swirl 
of hip-hop, jazz and electronica. 
Aside from occasionally pausing 
to gift a delighted audience 
with suave saxophone solos, 
Masego 
was 
constantly 
in 

motion, a blur of gangly legs and 
shuffling shoulders. GoldLink 
couldn’t have asked for a better 
introduction.

From the bouncing funk of 

“Herside Story” to the bright fizz 
of “Summatime” to the thumping 
staccato of “We Will Never Die,” 
GoldLink remained nonfrivolous; 
his 
show 
was 
refreshingly 

uncomplicated, remaining free of 
unnecessary frills. The dragging 
tempo of “The Parable of the 
Rich Man” contrasted the driving 
beat of “Kokamoe Freestyle,” but 
GoldLink performed both songs 
similarly: leaning over the edge 

of the stage, one foot perched 
on a speaker and completely 
nonchalant 
underneath 
the 

concentrated spotlight.

As he cycled through the 

majority of At What Cost, jumping 
from “Meditation” to “Roll Call” 
to “Crew,” GoldLink could get up 
close and personal. Unhindered 
by loud displays or a cluttered 
space, all eyes were on GoldLink. 
Rather than making the show 
monotone, 
the 
uniformity 

allowed his emotions to be on 
clear 
display. 
Personability 

infused every melody. 

There is a complexity found 

in 
everything 
GoldLink 
has 

produced: 
from 
the 
many 

appearances of other up-and-
coming D.C. rappers in At What 
Cost, to the wide-ranged sampling 
of D.C.’s regional style of go-go in 
The God Complex. This intricacy, 
however, is not what causes the 
songs to be memorable. Rather, it 
is GoldLink’s passion that drives 
his music; it’s a sentiment that 
effortlessly translates to his live 
shows.

The connection GoldLink has 

to his hometown, his music and 
his fans was undeniable during 
his 
performance. 
Underneath 

elaborate twists of hard rhymes 
and a vigorous BPM, there was 
authenticity: a honest dedication 
that has established GoldLink as a 
multifaceted powerhouse, despite 
his relatively simple presentation.

CONCERT REVIEW
DAILY ENTERTAINMENT & CULTURE COLUMN

The producer/singer performed at St. Andrew’s Hall last Tuesday

In the run-up to the release 

of “Blade Runner 2049,” my 
housemates and I decided it 
was time for us to watch the 
original “Blade Runner” from 
all those years ago. Heralded 
today as both a classic and one 
of the defining science fiction 
films of the 20th century, no 
one in my house had ever seen 
the movie. Of a panel that 
included a film major, an avid 
film/TV buff and just your 
average film watcher, upon 
finishing the movie, only one 
of us professed to having liked 
it. That was me. My film buff 
friend thought it was boring 
and way too long, and moreover 
he professed that he thought 
he would’ve enjoyed it more 
if he hadn’t heard all these 
great things about it, creating 
high expectations going in. 
My friend who just watches 
movies causally didn’t care for 
it at all. Both of them felt the 
film’s label as a “classic” had 
made them dislike it even more, 
because they were expected to 
like it automatically.

My 
film 
buff 
friend 

continued to insist that it was 
his expectation for the movie 
that had primarily ruined his 
experience of it. He believed 
that in the wake of movies like 
“The Matrix” and TV shows 
such as “Black Mirror” and 
“Westworld,” the themes being 
pushed by “Blade Runner” 
seemed 
relatively 
quaint. 

This is similar to me to when 

I showed a hallmate “Star 
Wars” for the first time and 
she insisted that the movie was 
derivative and very familiar 
to “Harry Potter,” “The Lord 
of the Rings” and many other 
fantasy films. When we live in 
a media culture inspired and 
influenced by certain seminal 
works, sometimes it’s hard to 
watch the thing that started 
certain trends without feeling 
like you’re watching a more 
basic version of something 
you’ve already seen.

It also seems to me that 

certain movies, like “Blade 
Runner,” require the audience 
to sit with them for a bit before 
making 
a 
final 
judgment. 

Nowadays 
it’s 
expected 

that everyone has their gut 
reactions to any given moment 
or event ready to go instantly, 
but media that asks deep 
questions of you sometimes 
demands that you give it 
time. My film buff friend who 
hated “Blade Runner” in the 

immediate moment following 
our viewing has now insisted 
that we need to watch “The 
Final Cut” of the movie before 
we go see “Blade Runner 2049” 
this week. He said he’s begun 
to appreciate more what the 
movie was trying to do now that 
he’s given it some time and that 
he’s curious if director Ridley 
Scott (“Alien: Covenant”) fixed 
any of the perceived mistakes 
of the original film with one of 
his director’s cuts.

Does 
the 
moniker 
of 

a 
“classic” 
give 
a 
film 

expectations it can never live 
up to? If you’ve built up in 
your mind the idea of “Blade 
Runner” as a Harrison Ford 
action adventure, does that 
mean you are doomed to hate 
the actual “Blade Runner” for 
the rest of your life? Maybe the 
answer is that it’s important 
to 
remember 
that 
movies 

like “Blade Runner” became 
cult classics over time. No 
movie is a classic on the day 
it’s released. It took decades 
for “Blade Runner” to obtain 
its status as a monumentally 
influential piece of science 
fiction, so it’s unfair to expect 
people seeing it for the first 
time to necessarily accept it 
totally at first sight. Given 
time, it seems my film buff 
friend will eventually come 
around. As for my other friend, 
he barely made it through the 
movie the first time. You can’t 
please everyone.

Can we label ‘Blade 
Runner’ as a classic?

Looking at the effect this can have on the film’s viewing experience

COMMUNITY CULTURE PREVIEW
Basement Arts to put on 
Shakespeare compilation

Basement Arts brings William Shakespeare to Walgreen Theater 
in a hilarious fashioning of the famous playwright’s work

The most impressive and 

innovative way that students 
of the University’s School of 
Music, Theatre and Dance are 
creating 
theater 
is 
through 

the work of Basement Arts. A 
completely student run theatre 
group housed on North Campus 
that consistently runs a few 
shows per semester, Basement 
Arts situates its shows back to 
back, weekend to weekend — 
providing a space for students to 
exercise creativity and agency in 
the theatre.

Students who are interested 

in being a part of Basement 
Arts can propose both original 
and established works to be 
produced, directed, performed 
and designed by students to the 
Basement Arts board, an elected 
team of students in the SMTD. 
The turnover is quick, with 
rehearsal time being about three 
weeks and funds being minimal 
— but time and time again the 
students of the 
SMTD and the 
Basement team 
produce magic.

Next up on 

the 
Basement 

Arts agenda is 
“The Complete 
Works 
of 

William 
Shakespeare 
(Abridged)
[Revised],” 
which is being 
directed 
by 

Elle Smith and 
showcases two 
BFA performance majors and a 
BFA musical theatre major. Elle 
decided to propose this piece 
because it stands out as being 
different 
from 
conventional 

ideas of Shakespeare.

“I first saw a VHS recording 

of the original production with 
the Shakespeare club I started 
with a few of my friends from 

Shakespeare camp — I was a 
super cool kid,” she said. “It 
was the first time I realized that 
Shakespeare 
wasn’t 
always 

this 
serious 

form of drama; 
it could be really 
funny.”

Smith is no 

stranger to the 
field of directing 
— she has been 
directing 
both 

in and out of 
the 
University 

for her entire 
college 
career, 

having already 
directed 
for 

both Basement 
Arts 
and 

other 
student 

run 
theatre 

organizations 
on 
campus 

like 
Rude 

Mechanicals. 
Last year she 
directed “The Importance of 
Being Ernest” and “Dear.”

After 

graduation, Smith 
plans 
to 
pursue 

directing and is 
hoping to land an 
apprenticeship at 
a regional theatre 
in 
either 
New 

York or the Mid-
West. 
She 
has 

been 
passionate 

about her directing 
career 
since 

senior 
year 
of 

high school when 
she was urged by 
a teacher to go 

into directing. With that, she 
switched her career plan from 
actor to director.

She has directed for UPROD 

and student run pieces, for 
comedies and tragedies — but 
when asked about how comedy 
and tragedy differ, she claims, 
“In my experience, I’ve found 
that comedy needs to be treated 

very seriously, and drama needs 
emphasis on comedic moments.”

The piece she is currently 

directing, 
“The Complete 
Works 
of 

William 
Shakespeare 
(Abridged)
[Revised]”, 
which will be 
performed 
this 
coming 

weekend 
through 
Basement 
Arts, is a play 
written 
by 

Adam 
Long, 

Daniel 
Singer 

and 
Jess 

Winfield. 
The 
play 

experienced 
great 
success 

in New York 
and 
many 

other 
cities 

nationwide. It 

includes 37 Shakespeare plays 
in 97 minutes and was London’s 
longest 
running 
comedy 
in 

London’s West End. The entirety 
of Shakespeare’s major works 
are condensed into one play, 
played by three actors. Though 
the piece did originally debut 
in London, it has had thrived 
on stages in the United States as 
well.

Smith prides herself on being 

different in her directorial style.

“Everyone in the directing 

department 
has 
a 
different 

style,” she said. “I’m really 
into reimagining classic works 
with a modern twist — like my 
all-female production of ‘The 
Importance of Being Earnest’ 
last fall. I also have an amazing 
concept for a zombie production 
of ‘Hamlet.’”

With 
such 
vision, 
“The 

Complete Works of William 
Shakespeare 
(Abridged)

[Revised]” is sure to breathe 
fresh, fast life into nearly fourty 
classic plays.

MEN’S SOCCER
Zakyi plays the hero

The Michigan soccer team was 

sputtering offensively Saturday 
against Omaha until freshman 
striker Mohammed Zakyi turned 
the match on its head. 

With the Wolverines down 

1-0 in the 60th minute, freshman 
midfielder Marc Ybarra launched 
a free kick. His in-swinging cross 
over the top of the Omaha defense 
found Zakyi, who was able to sneak 
behind the Maverick back line to 
place a diving header to the left of 
goalkeeper Joseph Ghitis and knot 
the score at one.

“(Zakyi’s) a smashing young 

player,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 

Chaka Daley. “We’re excited to see 
his growth as a footballer. He’s a 
natural center forward, he scores 
goals.”

Forty-five minutes later, with 

Michigan locked in a tight overtime 
battle, Zakyi played the hero again.

Daley drew up the same play, 

with a nearly identical result. Ghitis 
thwarted Zakyi’s initial header, 
but the freshman’s relentlessness 
paid off, as he arrived first to the 
ensuing scramble and slotted 
the ball past the flailing Omaha 
defenders to give the Wolverines a 
2-1 victory.

“In practice, we work on free 

kicks a lot because in college, it’s 
really hard to (score from) through 
balls,” Zakyi said. “With free 
kicks and corner kicks it’s really 
important to just put your body on 
the line and (the second goal) was 
really scrappy, I just put myself on 
the line because it’s for the team.”

Michigan’s 
scoring 
troubles 

were on full display in the first 
half of Saturday’s match, as it 
was unable to find holes in the 
Mavericks’ defense, relying on 
ambitious long-balls and crosses 
to try to equalize after Omaha’s 
opening goal.

Success 
hasn’t 
come 

automatically to Zakyi in his first 
season in Ann Arbor, either. After 
scoring 10 minutes into his college 
career in the season opener against 

William and Mary, he missed 
nearly a month with an injury.

After being eased back into play 

following his return, he regained 
his starting role five matches ago 
against Oakland and hasn’t looked 
back, tallying four goals and three 
assists since then.

But Saturday was his best 

performance yet, signaling the 
completion of his transition to the 
college game.

“In high school, I (was able 

to) carry the ball a lot and dribble 
through 
players,” 
Zakyi 
said. 

“But in college, everyone is really 
physical … so you have to work 
extremely hard.”

While the increased physicality 

may have affected Zakyi early in the 
season, it is clear he has adapted, as 
his ability to win an aerial challenge 
with the Mavericks’ keeper caused 
the ball to fall to him for his match-
winning goal.

The two goals were not his only 

contributions, as he repeatedly 
challenged the Omaha defense 
in his 67 minutes — both with 
dangerous balls into the box 
and runs behind the Mavericks’ 
backline. He nearly ended the 
match in the first overtime, 
narrowly missing with a right-
footed shot from a tight angle after 
controlling a long ball and beating 
a defender one-on-one to get 
through on goal.

“Coming in as a freshman and 

playing against bigger guys. … They 
think that I’m going to be really 
weak and that I won’t be able to 
fight hard,” Zakyi said. “My team 
captain, (senior center back Billy 
Stevens), he’s really inspirational 
and he tells us we can do anything. 
(He) keeps me going no matter 
what so I think Bill has been an 
inspiration to me, making me play 
very well today.”

Saturday’s performance was 

just the most recent chapter in 
Zakyi’s young college career. With 
his confidence growing, and new 
heights seemingly being reached 
in every match, Zakyi’s continued 
success will be crucial for the 
Wolverines going forward.

Michigan pulls out late win over Omaha

As players jostled for position 

in the box awaiting the free kick, 
Mohammed Zakyi felt his jersey 
being tugged by the Omaha 
defenders marking him.

Seconds later, it was Zakyi 

himself grabbing his jersey and 
ripping it off in celebration.

Omaha 
goalkeeper 
Joseph 

Ghitis couldn’t control Tristan 
Jacob’s high-arcing set piece, and 
the ball fell in front of Zakyi. The 
freshman forward outstretched 
his foot and knocked the ball 
into the net, giving the Michigan 
men’s soccer team (4-1-1 Big 
Ten, 8-4-2 overall) a 2-1, double-
overtime 
victory 
over 
the 

Mavericks.

“I 
remember 
a 
defender 

was telling me that I’m trash, 
I can’t do anything, I’m just a 
freshman,” Zakyi said. “But I 
was like, ‘If you keep telling me 
(that) stuff, I’m going to do work’ 
because that keeps me going.”

This trash talk and physical 

back-and-forth play exemplified 
Saturday’s 
contest 
from 
the 

opening kickoff to Zakyi’s game-
winner, which came after 106 
minutes of gritty, hard-nosed 
competition from both sides. 
While it was a non-conference 
game, Michigan coach Chaka 
Daley stated it didn’t feel that 
way.

“That 
game 
was 
as 

in-conference, 
passionate 

fighting as it gets,” Daley said. 
“And Omaha made it that way.”

The Wolverines began the 

game looking “lively,” according 
to Daley. Michigan took five of 
the first seven shots, and Omaha’s 
only serious threat in the early 
going came off a Wolverine 
clearance error.

Due to Omaha’s physical style, 

however, serious chances from 
open play were hard to come 
by. And the Mavericks took 
advantage — in the 37th minute, 

forward Diego Gutierrez finished 
off a counterattack by firing a 
shot past freshman goalkeeper 
Henry Mashburn.

But when the teams went to 

the locker room at halftime, 
Daley wasn’t worried.

“I thought we were in control 

in the first half,” Daley said. 
“They scored a goal against the 
run of play. But in saying that, 
they’re a very tough team to play 
against. They were a challenge to 
us and we had to fight, scrap and 
claw for everything that we were 
going to get.”

To 
Daley, 
the 
problem 

wasn’t 
that 
his 
team 
was 

being outhustled. Instead, the 
emphasis at halftime centered 
on clinical finishing and set 
piece execution, two areas where 
Omaha was stronger in the first 
half.

“We wanted to tidy some 

things up and tighten up the 
ship,” Daley said. “We could 
have done a better job in the final 

third of making more dangerous 
services.”

Michigan certainly did after 

the 
break. 
Sixteen 
minutes 

into the second half, freshman 
midfielder Marc Ybarra drove a 
free kick deep into the six-yard 
box. Zakyi flew forward to meet 
the ball with his head, tying the 
game at one apiece.

But 
the 
Mavericks 
were 

undeterred, 
threatening 
to 

break the deadlock on multiple 
occasions. 
Forward 
Fred 

Frimpong had a one-on-one 
with Mashburn just 10 minutes 
after Zakyi’s goal, but Mashburn 
made an impressive save with 
his legs.

Three 
minutes 
later, 
an 

Omaha goal was disallowed due 
to an offside call. And in the 87th 
minute, Elvir Ibisevic surely 
would have scored the game-
winning goal if it weren’t for 
junior defender Daniel Mukuna 
being in perfect position to clear 
it.

The first overtime period, 

however, mostly belonged to the 
Wolverines, as they fired four 
shots to the Mavericks’ one. 
Zakyi found himself all alone on 
the edge of the box with seconds 
to go, but his effort was wide left.

His next attempt, however, 

was not.

“From a character standpoint, 

I thought it was great for the 
group,” Daley said. “We were 
exhausted at the end, and they 
made us work for it.”

After a tiring stretch of four 

games in 12 days, Michigan has 
plenty of time to recover before it 
travels to Ohio State on Saturday. 
But there’s more than a heated 
rivalry at stake — a Wolverine 
win would clinch a top-four 
finish in the Big Ten, and give 
them the opportunity to play 
at home during the conference 
tournament.

“You know how those games 

always go between our schools,” 
Daley said. “It’s a huge one.”

‘M’ falls in rivalry match with Spartans

The Michigan women’s soccer 

team fell, 2-1, to rival Michigan 
State in a game defined by 
missed scoring chances.

The Wolverines (2-4-3 Big 

Ten, 5-5-6 overall) can’t seem to 
beat their rivals, falling short to 
Michigan State (2-7-0 Big Ten, 
6-10-0 overall) after a loss to No. 
17 Ohio State last week. Going 
into 
the 

matchup, it 
seemed like 
Michigan 
would have blown out the 
Spartans. The game, originally 
postponed 
for 
weather 

conditions, was a shock for both 
sides.

The Wolverines started off 

strong offensively, dominating 
possession 
of 
the 
ball 
and 

notching four shots within the 
first four minutes. Junior forward 
Reilly Martin was the first to 
convert on a pass from freshman 
midfielder 
Nikki 
Hernandez, 

soaring past Michigan State 
defenders and scoring a 10-yard 
goal inside the box just over five 
minutes into the game.

“I 
think 
our 
chemistry 

together has really developed 
over the season,” Martin said. 
“It’s 
really 
great 
having 
a 

freshman who can step up and 
just take part in such a big role.”

The Spartans were quick to 

tie the game at 
though. Roughly 
three 
minutes 

after 
Martin’s 

goal 
midfielder 

Lexy 
Warner, 

tapped 
in 
a 

rebound 
inside 

the box.

“We 
had 

a 
number 
of 

situations where 
the ball’s falling 
and it seems like Michigan State 
is a step closer than us,” Martin 
said. “The one goal they scored 
in the first half, the ball was 
knocked in the box, dropped 
down and their player put it in. 
That was the difference.”

The match remained tied, 1-1, 

for the remainder of the half, 

as the Wolverines struggled 
to convert their shots to goals. 
The period ended with the 
Wolverines totaling 15 shots 
and one save compared to the 
Spartans four shots and five 
saves.

“Well 
you 
know, 

unfortunately 
for us today we 
hit a lot of shots 
high, a lot of 
shots wide. We 
just didn’t hit 
the target well,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach 
Greg 

Ryan. “Certainly 
not often enough 
with 
all 
the 

chances we had.”

At the start of the second half, 

Martin continued to implement 
the Wolverines’ strategy, which, 
according to her was to, “put 
high pressure on them for 90 
minutes.”

Though she was unsuccessful 

in giving Michigan a lead, 
Martin’s skill and talent didn’t 

go unnoticed. 

“Reilly was the best player 

for either team today, she 
showed for the ball, she got a 
ton of balls,” Ryan said. “She 
was dangerous every time she 
touched the ball, she dribbled by 
multiple Michigan State players, 
she took a lot 
of chances and 
scored a goal. 
It’s great to see 
Reilly rising to 
the 
occasion, 

she’s our most 
consistent 
scoring threat.”

Eventually, 

the 
Spartans 

found a scoring 
threat of their 
own. As the rain started to pour 
down with just over 58 minutes 
remaining, Warner set up the 
assist to break the tie. This 
allowed for forward Kristelle 
Yewah to head the ball into the 
goal, making the score 2-1. The 
Wolverine 
attack 
continued 

pressuring though, letting eight 

more shots fly in the remainder of 
the half. Overall, the Wolverines 
outshot the Spartans, 32-10, but 
lacked accuracy in shots on goal, 
often shooting high and wide.

“I think we needed to do a 

better job of creating higher 
percentage shots, so instead of 

shooting 
from 

outside the box, 
working a little 
bit 
harder 
to 

create 
chances 

inside 
the 

penalty 
box, 

which are higher 
percentage 
scoring chances,” 
Ryan said. “It’s 
something we’re 
going to work on 

every week and you know your 
hope your execution is good.”

Added Martin: “Unfortunately 

things didn’t fall our way, I think 
we outshot them by a lot on the 
attack and the field was not 
ideal, but that’s not an excuse we 
should have definitely put more 
goals away.”

WOMEN’S SWIMMING AND DIVING
Wolverines take third 
place at SMU Classic

As junior Siobhán Haughey 

touched the wall first in the final 
leg of the 800-yard freestyle 
relay on Friday night, it was 
clear that the defending Big Ten 
Champions had picked up right 
where they left off. 

The relay squad that anchors 

the 
Michigan 

women’s 
swimming 
and 

diving 
team 
– 

senior 
Gabby 

Deloof 
and 

juniors 
Catie 

Deloof, Rose Bi 
and Haughey – 
won the event by 
over five seconds 
and notched an 
NCAA “A” time 
of 7:00.71.

The sixth-ranked Wolverines 

did not perform as convincingly 
as a whole, but they still showed 
their talent in the SMU Classic 
on Friday and Saturday. They 
finished third with a score of 
322 behind perennial swimming 
powers No. 10 Louisville and No. 
5 USC. No. 21 UCLA, Miami, and 
SMU rounded out the field.

Haughey, who represented 

Hong Kong at the 2016 Rio 
Olympics, 
noted 
that 
there 

was “a lot of competition”, as 
she squared off multiple times 
against 
Louisville’s 
Mallory 

Comerford. Comerford, a sprint 
freestyler who won the 200-yard 
freestyle at last year’s NCAA 
Championship, won five gold 
medals at this summer’s World 
Swimming Championships in 
Budapest, Hungary.

In the 200-yard freestyle, 

Haughey put up a fight against 
the defending NCAA champion, 
touching the wall less than a 
second after Comerford. In the 
100-yard freestyle, she came up 
short against Comerford again 
but recorded a school-record 
time of 47.22 in the process.

The meet was not a traditional 

one — each team was allowed to 

bring just eight swimmers and 
one diver to the contest. Each 
event was comprised of only 
one swimmer from each school, 
giving the pool a “select” feel not 
usually present so early in the 
season.

“They were really thinking 

about fighting for their team 
back home in Ann Arbor,” 
said associate head coach Rick 

Bishop.

Added 

Haughey: “We 
were racing for 
them. ... They 
made a video 
to tell us good 
luck.”

Bishop 

credited “great 
leadership” 
from 
senior 

team 
captains 

Clara Smiddy and Gabby Deloof 
in helping to keep the team 
focused in such a small group.

“They 
lead 
from 
the 

front,” 
Bishop 
said. 
“Their 

performances were great.”

Smiddy, in particular, led by 

example with her dominance in 
the backstroke events, winning 
the 100-yard backstroke with a 
time of 52.55 and placing second 
in the 200-yard backstroke. She 
also finished second in the 200-
yard individual medley.

In 
addition

WOMEN’S TENNIS
Lommer clinches 
ITA Regional title

Coming 
into 
the 
ITA 

Midwest Regionals, sophomore 
Chiara 
Lommer 
was 
not 

expected 
to 
outshine 
her 

teammates on a senior-laden 
Michigan 
women’s 
tennis 

team. 

But the sure-handed Lommer 

set herself apart, dropping only 
one set in five matches en route 
to the Midwest Regional title 
and an automatic bid to the ITA 
National Fall Championships 
this November.

Lommer 
was 
granted 
a 

first-round bye, as were the 
four other Wolverine singles 
competitors in the tournament. 
But by the end of the third-
round 
match 
against 
Ohio 

State’s Olivia Sneed, she was 
the sole survivor of the group 
of five.

With 
her 
teammates 

cheering in the stands above, 
the 
115th-ranked 
Lommer 

dominated 
Illinois’s 
Mia 

Rabinowitz in straight sets, 
6-3, 6-2.

Yet the score did not paint 

a clear picture of the grueling 
points won by each player 
during the match.

A 
fortunate 
double-break 

including long rallies of up to 
15-plus shots characterized the 
battle between Lommer and 
Rabinowitz. In game three of 
the second set, Lommer found 
a crucial break that snowballed 
into 
two 
and 
a 
needed 

momentum boost in the match. 
Resilient through tough deuces 
and break points, Lommer’s 
durability would not truly be 
tested as much throughout the 
remainder of the tournament.

Following the quarterfinal 

matchup, a quick turnaround 
led 
to 
Lommer 
meeting 

Illinois’s Emilee Duong in the 
semifinals. 
Lommer 
routed 

her second Illini challenger in 
a row in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2. 
Duong had played in a total of 
eight matches throughout the 
course of the tournament and 
was struggling, particularly on 
serves, and presented Lommer 
with few obstacles.

Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 

Bernstein 
said 
Sunday 

afternoon prior to the title 
match that Lommer always 
represents the Wolverines well 
and fights for every point, and 
that she notably stepped up to 
the challenge of becoming the 
sole Michigan competitor to 
make it past the third round.

“Chiara 
is 
a 
confident 

kid, 
and 
even 
before 
the 

tournament, she’s trying to 
win the whole tournament,” 
Bernstein said. “She’s gonna 
take one match at a time and 
try to win the thing.”

In the championship match 

on Tuesday, Lommer battled 
against Ohio State’s Shiori 
Fukuda. Riding the momentum 
of her earlier matches, she 
jumped out to a 2-0 lead after 
a break on the first serve 
eventually leading to a 6-0 
romp. In the ensuing final set 
of the match, Fukuda jumped 
out to an early 3-1 lead with 
strong serves.

But Lommer was able to 

break back on Fukuda’s serve 
and then serve for the match, 
winning in straight sets 6-0, 
6-4. Her prize was the singles 
title 
and 
an 
unexpected 

championships 
berth 
in 

California next month. 

Enjoying dominant final season, Hurst 
presents major problem for Penn State

Yes, Michigan’s defense is 

good. 

The Wolverines rank first in 

the nation in total defense — 
allowing just 223.8 yards per 
game — first in pass efficiency 
defense, 
sixth 
in 
rushing 

defense and eighth in points 
allowed per game — giving up 
an average of 14.7.

Those 
are 
pretty 
eye-

popping 
numbers. 
Yet, 

according to Maurice Hurst, 
Michigan has yet to reach its 
full potential.

“I think we’re getting better 

each week, and I think we’re 
really starting to create our 
own identity and really gain 
(an) 
understanding 
of 
our 

defense and who we are as 

a defense,” Hurst said. “We 
kind of knew who we had last 
year and this year’s been a 
little more unknown, but I 
think we’ve really been able to 
develop into our own.”

Hurst 
said 
that 
identity 

meant stopping teams on third 
down, stopping the run and 
pressuring the quarterback.

The 
fifth-year 
senior 

defensive tackle is certainly 
a large part of those efforts. 
After deciding to return for his 
final season, Hurst has lived up 
to all of the hype.

On Monday, CBS Sports 

analyst 
Matt 
Miller 
listed 

Hurst as his 20th-best overall 
player for the 2018 NFL Draft, 
declaring Hurst the second-
best defensive lineman and the 
best run stopper. Pro Football 
Focus graded Hurst as the 

second-best player from Week 
7 after Michigan’s 27-20 win 
over Indiana — just one week 
after Hurst posted the nation’s 
top performance in a 14-10 loss 
to 
Michigan 

State, according 
to the scouting 
service.

He 
has 

earned 
accolades 
from his own 
coach, as well. 
On 
Monday, 

Jim Harbaugh 
named 
both 

Hurst 
and 

sophomore 
defensive 
end 

Rashan Gary as Michigan’s 
linemen of the week.

“Mo makes a field goal 

block,” Harbaugh said, “and Mo 
really played good this week, 

played really good last week.”

Receiving 
a 
similar 

performance from Hurst this 
week will be crucial to the 
Wolverines’ efforts against No. 

2 Penn State this 
weekend. And if 
past history is 
any 
indication, 

Hurst 
most 

certainly 
will 

present 
a 

challenge to the 
Nittany 
Lions’ 

offensive line.

In Michigan’s 

28-16 win over 
Penn 
State 
in 

2015, Hurst — then a redshirt 
sophomore — tied for second on 
the team in tackles, recording 
four with 0.5 for loss. Then, 
Hurst played an even larger role 
in the Wolverines’ scintillating 
defensive 
performance 
last 

year, recording six tackles 
(three for loss) and one sack.

Hurst’s history against the 

Nittany Lions — coupled with 
his play this year — makes it 
all the more likely that he’ll 
enjoy success in his final 
game against Penn State on 
Saturday night. And, if Nittany 
Lions coach James Franklin’s 
comments on Tuesday were 
any indication, Penn State is 
already well aware that its 
offensive gameplan will have 
to account for Michigan’s man 
in the middle.

“Very disruptive, (I) went 

back and kind of researched 
(Hurst) a little bit, in terms of 
what people are saying about 
him,” Franklin told reporters 
Tuesday. “(They’re) saying he’s 
going to be a first-round pick, 
probably a top-10 pick, and it 
looks like that on tape.

“I’ve got a lot of respect for 

him and his game and how he 
plays and the motor that he 
has. He’s an impressive guy to 
watch.”

Michigan loses match in four sets

Carly Skjodt fired an arcing 

serve that dipped over the 
net and left several Spartans 
sprawling on the floor. 

After the ace from the junior 

outside hitter, No. 10 Michigan 
State’s lead was cut to just 
24-21 in the third set. The three 
unanswered points appeared to 
be a glimmer of hope that the 
Michigan volleyball team (3-6 
Big Ten, 13-8 overall) could 
perhaps steal the set — and the 
match lead.

Or perhaps not.
Spartan outside hitter Brooke 

Kranda promptly fired a missile 
to the center of the Wolverine 
defense, and Michigan State 
closed out the set.

The 
Spartans 
(7-2, 
14-4) 

ripped off a huge 10-3 run 
toward the end of the fourth 
set to remove Michigan’s final 
glimmers of hope and win 
the match, 25-19, 25-27, 25-21, 
25-16.

Michigan 
State 
excelled 

offensively behind an extremely 
balanced attack on Wednesday 
night. Five different Spartans 
had nine or more kills.

“Their setter does a great job, 

she’s got a lot of options to go 
to and that’s what makes them 
so dangerous,” said Michigan 
coach 
Mark 
Rosen. 
“They 

control the ball well enough to 
let their setter run their offense 
and she’s got lots of weapons to 
go to.”

Similar to the rest of its 

season, Michigan failed to rise 
to the challenge against an elite 
opponent. Since entering the 
gauntlet of Big Ten play, the 
Wolverines are 3-6, losing three 
of those matches in straight 
sets. On the season, Michigan is 
sporting a dismal record of 0-6 
against top-25 teams.

“We’re not good enough,” 

Rosen said. “We’re trying to get 
better every day and we’re not 
good enough yet.”

Although 
they 
dropped 

the match in four sets, the 
Wolverines showed flashes of 
brilliance.

Skjodt, in particular, was 

exceptional. 
She 
delivered 

an 
all-around 
performance, 

notching a double-double with 
a season-high 24 kills and 10 
digs. While the majority of 
her team struggled against the 
defense of Michigan State’s 
hulking middle blockers, Skjodt 
repeatedly gashed the Spartan 
defense with an array of tip 
kills and booming spikes.

“(Skjodt’s) got such a great 

competitive 
spirit,” 
Rosen 

said. “She’s somebody who just 
battles.”

In the second set, Skjodt’s 

kills were crucial to a tense 
Michigan 
win. 
The 
teams 

jostled for position throughout 
the set, with eight lead changes 
and 11 ties. Senior middle 
blocker Claire Kieffer-Wright 
also had a huge set, earning two 
of Michigan’s last three kills. 
Both kills came courtesy of her 
excellent movement. She swung 
to the right of sophomore 
setter MacKenzi Welsh and 

pummeled the ball past the 
Spartan defense each time.

Above 
all, 
however, 
the 

Wolverines 
closed 
out 
the 

second set due to solid team 
play and excellent passing.

Despite 
an 
outstanding 

performance from Skjodt and 
a great team performance in 
the second set, the Wolverines 
were simply outplayed by the 
Spartans, who boast a roster 
full of experience.

“They have six seniors on 

the floor who’ve been playing 
together their whole career,” 
Rosen 
said. 
“They’re 
very 

smooth.”

The Wolverines will face 

yet another tough task as 
they travel to Ohio State on 
Sunday, and they still have two 
more ranked teams on their 
schedule.

According 
to 
Rosen, 

Michigan’s 
upcoming 
game 

plan is simple.

“We’ve got to get better.”
