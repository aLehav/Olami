Health System
collaborates
with county as a
precaution
By QUAN NGUYEN

For theDaily
Despite the unlikelihood that
the Ebola virus will come to Ann
Arbor, experts at the University
of Michigan Health System, the
School of Public Health and Uni-
versity Health Service are working
to construct a response plan to the
virus.
The worldwide death toll from
the viral disease is more than
4,500 as of Oct. 17. The vast major-
ity of the deaths have occurred
in the West African countries of
Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.
However, efforts to contain the
virus seem to be making headway
as the Centers for Disease Control
recently declared Nigeria and Sen-
egal Ebola-free.
On the home front, national con-
cern has increased after Thomas
Eric D tLibeian man vis-
iting family in Dallas, became the

first person in America to die from
Ebola Oct. 8.
That national attention prompt-
ed a formal response from the
University Tuesday afternoon,
when Robert Winfield, the Univer-
sity's Chief Health Officer, sent an
e-mail to the student body regard-
ing the school's current prepara-
tion for Ebola.
"We are behaving in a way to
maximize preparedness, minimize
risk and not alarm people unneces-
sarily," Winfield wrote.
The University has already
issued travel warnings for stu-
dents in countries that are heavily
affected by the virus. Additionally,
a protocol for students returning
from affected regions has been
established.
At UHS, patientscreenings have
become more detailed, particular-
ly in regards to travel histories for
patients who report fever or other
Ebola-like symptoms.
"We never did this level of
screening in the past," Winfield
said. "This is all in response to con-
cern of this infectious disease."
Epidemiology Prog. Eden Wells,
associate director of the preventa-
tive medicine residency, said all
University health units are making

New Ferguson
resolution to
be considered


After rejection
of first proposal,
CSG looks to tackle
police brutality
By TANAZ AHMED
Daily StaffReporter
After a resolution to stand
in solidarity with the people of
Ferguson was introduced Sept.
16 and was voted down Oct. 7,
a new resolution against police
brutality was proposed during
the Central Student Govern-
4l ment meeting Tuesdaynight.
The new legislation resolves
to stand in solidarity with the
people of Ferguson, Mo., sup-
port the policy solutions out-
lined by an activist Shaun King
and the Dream Defenders - a
social justice organization from
Florida - in their change.org
petition and create a joint event
with the Commission on Stu-
dent Safety and Security dis-

cussingpolice actions.
In August, following the
shooting of unarmed Black
teenager Mike Brown by a
white police officer, the people
of Fergusoniresponded with
protests calling for the end of
racial stereotyping and police
violence. The change.org peti-
tion asks U.S. citizens to end
police brutality in response of
the events in Ferguson.
Unlike the old proposal,
which was authored by both
community members as well as
CSG members, the new legisla-
tion was written by seven CSG
representatives. The current
resolution is also shorter than
the previous one.
"We tried to strip it down
and get to the heart of what we
were so keen on in the other
resolution ...We hope the moral
compass of this assembly is
on par with the values of this
kind of resolution," said LSA
senior Kathryn Abercrombie,
LSA representative and author

Daily StaffReporter
With cold and flu season in
full swing, students may be
heading to medical profession-
als hoping to get a prescription

for antibiotics and a quick and
easy means of restoring good
health.
However, Martin Blaser,
director of the Human Micro-

Medicine at New York Univer-
sity, spoke to around 250 people
on the over consumption of
antibiotics and their long term
effects on human microbes
by giving a peek at parts of his

The event was hosted by the
University's Host Microbiome

Blaser discussed his book,

Former Washington Post
editor Ben Bradlee dies

American released froni
North Korea, two remain

Mentor to Watergate
reporters remembered
for strong leadership
WASHINGTON (AP) - In a
charmed life of newspapering,
Ben Bradlee seemed always to
be in just the right place.
The raspy-voiced, hard-
charging editor who invigo-
rated The Washington Post got
an early break as a journalist
thanks to his friendship with
one president, John F. Kennedy,
and became famous for his role
in toppling another, Richard
Nixon, in the Watergate scan-
dal.
Bradlee died at home Tues-
day of natural causes, the Post
reported. He was 93.
Ever the newsman and ever
one to challenge conventional
wisdom, Bradlee imagined his
own obituary years earlier and
found something within it to
H-m

quibble over.
"Bet me that when I die,"
he wrote in his 1995 memoir,
"there will be something in my
obit about how The Washing-
ton Post 'won' 18 Pulitzer prizes
while Bradlee was editor." That,
he said, would be bunk. The
prizes are overrated and sus-
pect, he wrote, and it's largely
reporters, not newspapers or
their editors, who deserve the
credit.
Yet the Post's Pulitzer-win-
ning coverage of the Watergate
scandal is an inextricable part
of Bradlee's legacy, and one
measure of his success in trans-
forming the Post from a sleepy
hometown paper into a great
national one.
As managing editor first and
later as executive editor, Bra-
dlee engineered the Post's rein-
vention, bringing in a cast of
talented journalists and set ting
editorial standards that brought
the paper new respect.
5-m

When Bradlee retired from
the Post newsroom in 1991,
then-publisher Donald Graham
said: "Thank God the person
making decisions in the last 26
years showed us how to do it
with verve and with guts and
with zest for the big story and
for the little story."
With Watergate, Bradlee
himself became a big part of a
story that epitomized the glory
days of newspapers - back
before web sites, cable chatter
and bloggers drove the talk of
the day.
Actor Jason Robards turned
Bradlee into a box-office hit
with his Oscar-winning por-
trayal of the editor in the 1976
movie "All the President's Men,"
which recounted the unraveling
of Watergate under the report-
ing of Bob Woodward and Carl
Bernstein. Bradlee's marriage
in 1978 to Post star reporter
Sally Quinn (his third) added
more glamour to his image.
He was one of the few to
know the identity early on of
the celebrated Watergate source
dubbed Deep Throat, revealed
publicly in 2005 to be FBI offi-
cial W. Mark Felt.
"I think he did a great service
to society," Bradlee said after
Felt's role finally came out.
In enduring partnership with
publisher Katharine Graham,
Bradlee took a stand for press
freedom in 1971 by going for-
ward with publication of the
Pentagon Papers, a secret study
of the Vietnam War broken by
The New York Times, against
the advice of lawyers and the
entreaties of top government
officials. The ensuing legal
battle went all the way to the
Supreme Court, which upheld
the right of newspapers to pub-
lish the leaked papers.
The Post's decision to publish
helped pave the way for all of
the smaller, difficult ones that
collectively produced the news-
paper's groundbreaking cover-
age of Watergate.

Ohio resident
returns to U.S. after
awaiting trial for
six months
WASHINGTON (AP)-Amer-
ican detainee Jeffrey Fowle has
been released from North Korea,
nearly six months after he was
taken into custody on charges
of leaving a Bible in a nightclub,
the State Department said Tues-
day. Two other Americans who
have been tried and convicted of
crimes in North Korea are still
being held.
Fowle, 56, of Miamisburg,
Ohio, had been awaiting trial
on charges of leaving a Bible at
a nightclub in the northern port
city of Chongjin last May. He
was flown out of North Korea on
a U.S. government jet that was
spotted Tuesday by Associated
Press journalists at Pyongyang's
international airport. The Swed-
ish government helped negotiate
Fowle's release.
State Department deputy
spokeswoman Marie Harf said
the plane took Fowle to Guam on
its way to the United States. She
said that Fowle had been evalu-
ated by a doctor and appeared to
be in good health.
White House spokesman
Josh Earnest said it was a posi-
tive decision by North Korea to
release Fowle. He urged Pyong-
yang to release the other Ameri-
cans, Kenneth Bae and Matthew
Miller.
"The U.S. will continue to
work actively on them," he said.
Washington announced
Fowle's release even before his
family's attorney had been noti-
fied. "We are overwhelmed with
excitement but still want com-
plete confirmation," attorney
Timothy N. Tepe said in a state-
ment.
Earnest said the Defense
Department had provided trans-
portation to Fowle on a schedule
that the North had specified. He

said Sweden had helped facili-
tate Fowle's release. The U.S.
doesn't have formal diplomatic
relations with North Korea.
Harf said Fowle was on his
way home to his family.- "We
welcome the DPRK's decision to
release him," she said in a state-
ment, using the abbreviation for
the Democratic People's Repub-
lic of Korea.
Harf also thanked Sweden for
"tireless efforts" by its embassy
in Pyongyang. She provided no
other details about the Swedish
government's involvement.
Washington has repeatedly
tried to send a high-level repre-
sentative to North Korea to seek
release of the three men. Pyong-
yang had refused as recently as
last month, according to Rob-
ert King, the U.S. special envoy
for North Korean human rights
issues.
The three Americans entered
North Korea separately. In inter-
views last month with the AP, all
three said they believed the only
solution to their situation was
for a U.S. representative to come
to North Korea to make a direct
appeal.
Fowle arrived in North Korea
on April 29 and was arrested in
May for leaving a Bible at the
nightclub. Christian evangelism
is considered a crime in North
Korea. Fowle is an equipment
operator for the city of Moraine,
Ohio, and has a wife and three
children. His wife is from Russia
and had made a written appeal
on her husband's behalf to Rus-
sian President Vladimir Putin.
The other detained men are:
-Matthew Miller, 24, from
Bakersfield, California. Miller
was convicted Sept. 14 of enter-
ing North Korea illegally to com-
mit espionage and sentenced to
six years of hard labor. At his
90-minute trial, North Korea's
Supreme Court said he tore up
his tourist visa at Pyongyang's
airport upon arrival on April 10
and admitted to having the "wild
ambition" of experiencing pris-
on life so that he could secret-

ly investigate North Korea's
human rights situation. In Late
September, he spoke briefly to
an AP journalist at a Pyongyang
hotel where the North Korean
government allowed him to call
his family. He said he was dig-
ging in fields eight hours a day
and being kept in isolation, but
so far his health wasn't deterio-
rating.
Kenneth Bae, 46, of Lynwood,
Washington. Bae is a Korean-
American missionary who is
serving a 15-year sentence for
alleged and unspecified "hos-
tile acts." He was arrested in
November 2012 while leading
a tour group in a special North
Korean economic zone. Pyong-
yang accused Bae of smuggling
in inflammatory literature and
trying to establish a base for
anti-government activities at
a border city hotel. His sister
believes Bae's Christian faith
got him into trouble. In recent
interviews with The AP, Bae said
his trial lasted no more than 90
minutes and is suffering from
chronic health problems, includ-
ing back pain. His family also
says his suffers from diabetes,
an enlarged heart and liver prob-
lems. He has said he feels aban-
doned bythe U.S. government.
In 2009, North Korea
detained two American jour-
nalists, Laura Ling and Euna
Lee, who were later freed after
former U.S. President Bill Clin-
ton visited Pyongyang. In 2011,
former President Jimmy Carter
came to North Korea to win the
release of imprisoned American
Aijalon Gomes, who had been
sentenced to eight years of hard
labor for crossing illegally into
North Korea from China.
Korea has previously used
detained Americans as leverage
in its standoff with the U.S. over
its nuclear and missile programs,
a charge that Pyongyang denies.
But Washington also has
floated the possibility of a dip-
lomatic opening in ties between
the two countries should North
Korea free the detainees.

GARY, Ind.
Police: Indiana
man confesses to
seven murders
Police say an Indiana man has
now definitively confessed to
killing seven women whose bod-
ies were found over the weekend
in northwestern Indiana.
Gary Police Chief Larry
McKinley also told a news con-
ference that authorities have
enough evidence to charge Dar-
ren Vann, 43, with murder in
at least three more of the cases
involving bodies discovered in
abandoned buildings around the
city over the weekend. McKinley
said those charges were expect-
ed to be filed within a few days. .
Vann was arrested over the
weekend after a missing per-
son's report led police to a body
in a bathtub at a Motel 6 in Ham-
mond. He confessed to that mur-
der and directed police to six
more bodies. The first murder
charge was filed against him on
Monday.

Medical Center's biocontainment
center on Oct. 6.
The medical center announced

that he is "Ebola free and feeling
so blessed."
FRIDAY HARBOR, Wash.
Newborn Puget
Sound killer whale
0 presumed dead
A killer whale born to much
hope in early September appar-
ently died while its pod was in
the open ocean off Washington or
British Columbia, the Center for
Whale Research said.
The baby was the first known
calf born since 2012 to a popula-
tion of endangered orcas that
frequent Puget Sound in Wash-
ington state.
It has not been seen since its
pod returned in recent days to the
inland waters of western Wash-
ington, said the center's Ken Bal-
comb.
"The baby is gone," he said
Tuesday.
The pod was offshore for a
week to 10 days, and the orca des-
ignated L-120 might have been
lost in a storm in the middle of
last week, Balcomb said.

TEHRAN, IRAN
Iran president
pledges to back
f Iraq amid attacks
Shiite powerhouse Iran has
pledged enduring support for the
Shiite-led government of Iraq in
its battle against an ascendant
Sunni insurgency spearheaded by
the Islamic State group.
Iranian President Hassan Rou-
hani told visiting Iraqi Prime
Minister Haidar al-Abadi on
Tuesday that Iran has supported
Baghdad "from the first day and
will remain on that path until the
last day," according to a report by
the official IRNA news agency.
Later, the state news agency
reported that Supreme Leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has
final say on all state matters, told
al-Abadi that he considered the
security of Iraq and Iran "insepa-
rable."
The Iran-Iraq alliance high-
lights some of the complex politi-
cal dynamics spawned by the
t emergence of the Islamic State
group as a major threat earlier
this year.

"As mayor, I would seek to
attract the right kind of talent to
the city. I don't just want 'young
professionals' because of their
youth or their moneymaking
ability. I want young people-
all people, really-who show a
respectfor the environment, who
see great value in small- to mid-
sized city life, and who genuinely
fit in with the larger goals of Ann
Arbor: kindness, sustainability,
community," Kelly said. "We are
fortunate to be able to live here,
and the right kind of people will
see that."
Taylor said, as mayor, he would
work to balance the needs of the
older, long-term Ann Arborites,
as well as students and young-
adult residents. For example, he
advocates for ride-sharing ser-
vices like Uber and Lyft, which
largely appeal to the population
of students and recent graduates.
He said Uber and Lyft are the
types of organizations that bring
young people to a city. The push-
back, however, following the

Uber and Lyft apps launching
in Ann Arbor, has been strong.
Those opposing these services
are often traditional taxi drivers
in Ann Arbor, who must con-
form to a number of regulations
to retain their licenses. Council-
members who oppose creating a
resolution that would make these
services legal within the city of
Ann Arbor feel the services are
unsafe and require further reg-
ulation, which to many would
defeat the ease and purpose of
these types of services.
Another issue Taylor said is
important for drawing in and
retaining young professionals
is the city's culture and values,
which could range anywhere
from the city's unique character
and the types of events, concerts
and festivals held in the city, to
how environmentally friendly
a city is. Taylor supports Ann
Arbor's current climate action
plan, and said he would continue
to do so as mayor.
At Monday's City Council
meeting, an $85,000 contract
between the city and the Clean
Energy Coalition was unani-
mously approved - a decision
that was emblematic of the coun-
cil's commitment to addressing
environmental issues. The origi-

nal decision, however, to allocate
$125,000 from the city's general
budget, among other sources,
was heavily contested and only
passed with a 6-5 vote. Taylor
voted in support of both deci-
sions, and the city's new contract
with the CEC will reduce only
non-University-caused carbon
emissions.
"It's great that we have some
city funding to do this work,
though I think our challenges
are that city-wide we spend
$250 million on natural gas and
electricity, so there are pure
economic reasons to do this,
in addition to all of the carbon
benefits that come along with
figuring out ways for people to
reduce their energy," said Matt
Naud, city environmental coor-
dinator.
Taylor's plan to increase job
opportunities and economic
growth rests in his support of
SPARK, a city-funded organiza-
tion that aims to create entre-
preneurial growth and further
advance Ann Arbor's econo-
my. The renewal of SPARK's
$75,000 contract was heavily
debated at first, and the deci-
sion was tabled until September
when it was approved by a 8-3
vote.


MICROBES
From Page 1A
medicine has triggered changes
that are leading to new diseases.
Blaser said understanding this
phenomenon is key for reversing
the current situation.
"We have believed so much in
antibiotics that wherever we've
gone we have taken a box with
us and people accept it because
antibiotics can be life saving," he
said. "They can help in so many
severe cases. But none of us have
been measuring what are the
side effects - what are the down
sides?"
Blaser is a member of the
eight-member external advi-
sory committee composed of
non-University professors and
medical specialists that will be
reviewing the Host Microbiome
Initiative's work Wednesday.
Thomas Schmidt, a profes-
sor of Ecology and Evolutionary
Biology, is one lab leader at the
Center for Microbial Studies. He
said the difference between the
Center and the Host Microbiome
Initiative is that the latter focus-
es solely on human microbes
while the former also deals
with microbes found beyond the

human body in aquatic, terrestri-
al environments and engineered
systems.
"One of the missions of the
Center is to educate and engage
in discussions in discussions of
the microbial world," Schmidt
said.
He added that he appreciated
gaining Blaser's perspective and
expertise to the public during his
visit to the University.
Blaser read excerpts about
the effects of widespread use by
pregnant woman of the drugs
Diethylstilbestrol, or DES, and
Thalidomide, both developed
in 1950s. He said these drugs
never had a lot of scientific
basis to support them, but were
marketed very well leading to
overconsumption. DES in par-
ticular, whose symptoms became
apparent many years later, is an
example of an instance where
antibiotic's potential side effects
may not be initially apparent.
Blaser noted that probiot-
ics, which are organisms and
microbes inside foods that
when consumed provide appar-
ent benefits, are usually safe but
are largely untested and more
research should be conducted
on them. He added that in addi-
tion to medication, humans often
ingest antibiotics when they con-

sume meat and dairy after the
animals have been given food
supplemented with antibiotics.
He added that people who
have minimal exposure to or
have never come in contact with
antibiotics should see how unaf-
fected microbes look to better
understand the full impact of the
mutation.
"One of the problems is anti-
biotics are everywhere - in all
the developing countries in the
world," Blaser said.
He emphasized the difficulty
in finding a person that was com-
pletely not-exposed to antibiot-
ics.
Assistant Medical Prof. Vin-
cent , Young said the University
will allocate approximately $3
million per year for the next five
years to the Host Microbiome
Initiative.
He added that this is major
initiative both in health and dis-
eases and noted that people often
wrongly assume that the Medi-
cal School mostly deals with
treating diseases.
"The opposite is probably
more true with the microbiome;
it has ways of keeping us healthy
and if we really understand that
then that's really even more
powerful than trying to find new
ways to treatthings," Young said.

EBOLA
From Page 1A
ongoing progress of developing
a protocol to handle a potential
Ebola patient.
"If there is a suspect case, the
leadership of the University, Dr.
Winfield, and the hospitals sys-
tem will be immediately noti-
fied," Wells said. "The Public
Health Department will work
to immediately assess risk, and
they will work in partnership
with the state health depart-
ment and the CDC to determine
that level of risk."
From that point forward,
treatment depends on whether
or not the patient shows symp-
toms. If they were exhibiting
symptoms, the patient would
be put into isolation under the
supervision of infectious disease
experts. In the event that the
patient were a student, decisions
regarding their course of treat-
ment would be determined by
the Public Health Department,
the CDC, and the local hospital
system.
If a student were to return
from an infected region, and
did not exhibit symptoms, they
would still need to be placed ina
quarantine with constant moni-
toring until the 21-day incuba-
tion period - the longest time
an individual can experience
between initial exposure and
exhibiting symptoms - of the
virus has ended.
Internal Medicine Prof. San-
dro Cinti, a specialist in infec-
tious diseases, confirmed what
experts have said about the dis-
ease in Michigan - namely that
the threat is extremelylow- but
said UMHS is preparing any-
ways.
"We have been preparing
since we knew there is a pos-
sibility that somebody from
(West Africa) could come in and
so what we are preparing for is
making sure we catch any poten-
tial patient as early as possible
and then isolate that patient and
protect our healthcare workers,"
Cinti said.
According to Winfield, a
potential Ebola patient would
immediately be placed in an iso-
lation room to prevent spread of
the disease to other patients or
hospital staff. UMHS currently
has 32 isolation beds, which are
generally used for respiratory
infectious disease. While UMHS
- along with any other major
health system - must prepare
for the possibility of admitting
an Ebola patient, current U.S.
cases are being treated at only a
small handful of medical centers
with specialized biocontain-
ment units.
Winfield said the exact loca-
tion where a potential Ebola
patient would be treated at
UMHS is still under discussion.
"There is no existing Ebola
unit at this time," Winfield said
in an interview with The Michi-
gan Daily.
Last week, the Michigan
Nurses Association expressed
concern that nurses across the
state were not properly trained
to handle asuspected Ebola case.

"MNA is working aggres-
sively with our nurses and their
employers to ensure that RNs
have the proper equipment,
training and staffing to safely
care for individuals with Ebola,"
the association wrote in the
release.
Winfield said the nurses at
UHS will be trained this week
and they will follow the CDC's
protocol of handling an Ebola
patient.
Sandro Cinti said the health
system as a whole is currently
working to establish a team of
hospital staff that would treat
an Ebola case. Administrators
are taking particular care to
ensure staff are well-trained in
the use of PPE - personal pro-
tective equipment - which is
critical in stopping the spread
of the disease. A breach of PPE
protocol is thought to have led
to the infection of two nurses in
Dallas who treated Duncan, the
Liberian man who died from
Ebola despite receiving pal-
liative treatment in the United
States.
The size of the team and the
amount of time that a healthcare
worker would spend with the
patient in an isolation unit have
not yet been determined.
"There will be a limited num-
ber of workers working with
Ebola patient and they will be
chosen based on the CDC crite-
ria," Cinti said.
Additionally, EMS staff is
training for a scenario where an
Ebola patient shows up at a clinic
instead of at the hospital. Primary
concerns for EMS protecting the
drivers and paramedics, as well as
decontaminating the vehicle car-
rying the infected patient.
"The plan has primarily
focused around the emergency
department and staff," Winfield
said.
Last week, the University's
Emergency Department held a
training session in conjunction
with St. Joseph Mercy Hospital
involving a mock patient.
The cooperation and com-
munication between health
units in Washtenaw County
- including the University, St.
Joseph Mercy Health System,
and both the local and state
health departments - makes
this region particularly efficient
in both emergency planning and
response, Wells said, something
many counties throughout the
U.S. struggle with.
Organizations such as the
Washtenaw County Medical
Society, which brings together
representatives from each of
these organizations to foster
quick and coordinated proce-
dures, put the region in a good
position to combat risks associ-
ated with the virus.
At the moment, officials are
confident that these measures,
as well as continued prepara-
tion efforts, will prove sufficient
in combating the threat. Wells
said it is important for the public
to stay informed on the threat,
but encouraged them not to get
distracted by various theories,
misunderstandings, and perhaps
even conspiracy theories that
appearthroughsocial media and
other outlets.

Obama requires five U.S.
airports to up Ebola checks

People flying from
threeAfrican countries
must come through
specific airports
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fend-
ing off demands to ban travel
from Ebola-stricken West Afri-
ca; the Obama administration
instead tightened the nation's
defenses against Ebola by
requiring that all arrivals from
the disease-ravaged zone pass
through one of five U.S. airports.
The move responds to pres-
sure from some Congress mem-
bers and the public to impose a
travel ban on the three coun-
tries at the heart of the Ebola
outbreak, which has killed over
4,500 people, mostly in Liberia,
Guinea and Sierra Leone, since it
emerged 10 months ago.
Beginning Wednesday, peo-
ple whose trips began in Guinea,
Liberia or Sierra Leone must fly
into one of the five U.S. airports
performing fever checks for
Ebola, the Homeland Security
Department said.
Previously, the administra-
tion said screenings at those air-
ports covered about 94 percent
of fliers from the three countries
but missed a few who landed
elsewhere.
There are no direct flights
from those nations into the U.S;
about 150 fliers per day arrive by
various multi-leg routes.
Homeland Security Secretary
Jeh Johnson said "we currently
have in place measures to iden-
tify and screen anyone at all land,
sea and air ports of entry into the
United States who we have rea-

son to believe has been presentin
Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea
in the preceding 21 days."
SincescreeningstartedOct.11
at New York's Kennedy airport,
562 people have been checked
at the five airports, according
to Homeland Security. Of those,
four who arrived at Washing-
ton's Dulles airport were taken
to a local hospital. No cases of
Ebola have been discovered.
The other airports are New-
ark's Liberty, Chicago's O'Hare
and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson.
Homeland Security officials
at the airports use no-touch
thermometers to check for fever,
which can be a symptom of Ebola
infection. People who have been
infected with the virus may not
develop a fever and illness for up
to 21 days, however.
As the U.S. closed a gap in its
Ebola screening, an Ebola-free
African country said it would
begin checking visiting Ameri-
cans for the disease.
Rwanda's health minister
said Tuesday that travelers who
have been in the United States or
Spain - the two countries out-
side ofWestAfricathathave seen
transmission during the Ebola
outbreak - will be checked upon
arrival and must report on their
health during their stay.
No Ebola cases have been
reported in Rwanda, which is in
East Africa. The U.S. Embassy in
Rwanda said that country is ban-
ning visitors who have recently
traveled to Guinea, Liberia, or
Sierra Leone, the three coun-
tries at the heart of the outbreak,
as well as nearby Senegal, which
had a single case
The change in U.S. policy falls
short of demands by some elect-

ed officials and candidates for a
ban ontravel from the West Afri-
can outbreak zone. Sen. Chuck
Schumer, D-N.Y., described the
action as an "added layer of pro-
tection against Ebola entering
our country."
The change comes as the
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention works to spread the
word about its new protective
guidelines for medical workers.
The advice, released Monday
night, had been sought by health
workers after two Dallas nurses
were infected while caring for a
Liberian traveler, the first per-
son diagnosed with the virus in
the United States.
The CDC said it's still unclear
exactly how the nurses were
infected, but the stronger rules
will provide better protection.
CDC officials demonstrated
the recommended techniques
Tuesday at a training session
for several thousand health care
workers in New York City.
New York Gov. Andrew
Cuomo urged the health-care
workers there to use their train-
ing to educate their families and
communities.
"Keep the anxiety down.
Keep the fear down," he said.
Earlier CDC guidelines
allowed hospitals some flex-
ibility to use available covering
when dealing with suspected
Ebola patients. The new guide-
lines set a firmer standard, call-
ing for full-body garb and hoods
that protect worker's necks; set-
ting rigorous rules for removal
of equipment and disinfection
of hands; and calling for a "site
manager" to supervise the put-
ting on and taking off of equip-
ment.

of the new resolution. "So, we
wanted to give the assembly
something to work with."
"We wanted this to be some-
thing a little bit more than just a
sympathetic showing of support
from the entire student body,"
said LSA senior Michael Chrzan,
School of Education representa-
tive, in reference to the change.
org petition. He later proposed
a campus event in tandem with
the resolution.
The Change.org petition was
one of the first started after the
shooting of Brown and it calls
for national change to protect
people against police violence.
Currently, the petition has more
than 200,000 signatures.
CSG members expressed con-
cerns with the resolution's sup-
port of the seven policies within
Shaun King and the Defender's
petition.
"Are the authors open to
writing some different policy
solutions as there may be some
issues with these?" CSG presi-

dent Bobby Dishell, a Public
Policy senior, asked during the
meeting.
Dishell had concerns about
two of the policy solutions.
One of the solutions states that
chokeholds and chest com-
pressions should be federally
banned. Dishell pointed out that
chest compressions are often
used to save people's lives.
Another solution in the peti-
tion calls for a third party busi-
ness to monitor videos from
cameras worn by policemen
while on duty. Dishell noted
that third parties are not always
trustworthy.
CSG representatives had
issues with another policy,
which proposes mandatory for-
ward-facing cameras for police-
men on duty. The cost of the
cameras, approximately $99 per
camera, was seen as being too
expensive for some towns.
The resolution against police
brutality was referred to the
resolutions committee. The leg-
islation will be reviewed by the
committee and then the assem-
bly will vote on the proposal in
the following meeting.

UHS Health Assessment Survey reveals alcohol abuse in students
n Oct. 15, University Health Service published the
National Health Assessment Survey, a study that looks
at general health indicators of the student body. The
results of this survey provide a useful tool for identifying
positive and negative health trends of University students. The
Michigan Daily Editorial Board has isolated three main topics
for analysis: Alcohol and drug abuse, mental health, and sexual
health and relationships. This editorial focuses on alcohol and
drug abuse among the student population.

Choice will be holding its second
annual Abortion Speak Out.
The Abortion Speak Out is an
opportunity for members of our
campus communitywhohavehad an
abortion(s) to share their experience
in a safe, supportive and judgment-
free space. While we encourage all
Univesity community members to
join us in listening to the stories of

friends and peers, only individuals
who have had an abortion will have
the opportunity to speak.
It's time to come together
to end the stigma and shame
around abortion.
*We recognize that not all people
who have abortions identify as
women; transgender men and
gender-nonconforming individuals

also opt to terminate pregnancies.
However, available statistical data
only measures the prevalence of
abortion among cisgender women.
Please contact Students for
Choice (sfceboard@umich.edu) if
you have any questions.

Warning: this institution supports blindness

You can walk through this
institution and never
look back.
Never look
back at your foot-
steps being inlaid
with gold.
Never look
back at the pool
of privilege drip-
ping heavily fromC
your being.
Neverlookback MAJA
at the lives you TOSIC
step over as you
move forward.
I know, because I was one
of them.
Like the majority of students in
every entering freshman class, I
walked through these ivory doors
light as a breeze. As I opened the
front gates, I was enamored by the
vast "diversity." I was mesmerized
by the knowledge and the
intellectual bubble I had entered. I
felt welcomed. At the same time, I
had the liberty of not experiencing
many things.
I wasn't choked by the
omnipresent waves of whiteness
and elitism that infiltrated every
hall. I never entered a classroom
feeling singled out or alone. I was
never challenged to contemplate
my race or to even understand that
whiteness is a race. I was prepared
by a white and upper-middle-class
community to handle my new
Universitycommunity.My privilege
allowed me to be unaware. And my
blindness continued, because this
institution will keep you blind.
It will tighten the web of oppres-
sion, so that you can't cross racial
lines honestly and wholeheartedly.

It will tighten the blindfold on your
eyes, so that you can't see the con-
struction of privilege alongside the
construction of luxury dorms. It
will provide a ladder to the selected
many to climb and not see the real-
ity of others as they are left behind.
But unlike me, there were
some that did not have the
same experience.
For some students, their college
career started with a summer
program. While I was blissful in
ignorance and enjoyed my summer
filled with sun and travel, a small
portion of students were invited
to a summer program meant to
prepare them to their new lives
at the University. Beyond the
accelerated classes and study tips,
the core of the program is meant to
assimilate. There was no program
meant to introduce myself and my
white peers to the impact of our
identity before starting college. Yet
this program that brought many
cash-poor individuals and students
of color were to campus early in
order to learn how to live and act
in an institution that silences them
and praises wealth and whiteness.
Though such explicit words would
never be used as descriptors.
The need for such a program is
maintainedbythe suffocatingwhite
supremacy dominating these halls.
And if you do not see the domina-
tion of white privilege and power,
then the institution is success-
fully completing its mission. This
institution doesn't wish to unearth
troubling and problematic mecha-
nisms. It doesn't want conscious-
ness to spread. Otherwise it would
make an effort to do so. Instead, it's
perfectly fine with sustaining the

need for such summer programs
without tackling the source of the
problem. The institution is run by
making one "cover-your-ass" move
after another. These moves, such
as developing the summer program
and the Race and Ethnicityrequire-
ment,hosting a dinner meant to dis-
cuss ways to combat sexual assault
and renovating the Trotter Mul-
ticultural Center are all ways the
University is covering its own ass.
These actions do not solve the real
issues and do not protect the lives of
targeted students.
I broke my blindness by actively
seeking the few communities that
were willing to challenge my exis-
tence. It took effort for me to see my
identity and to contextualize it. But
I can walk away from all of it. I can
walk away from the need to chal-
lenge my awareness of race. The
bungee cord of privilege is tightly
wound around my hips. It's con-
stantly pulling me back to the high
platform of ignorance, and I must
actively resist it. But I have chosen
to run over the cliff and fall into the
pit of awareness. For many, there is
no bungee cord to pull them back to
safety. The pit is real and the cliffs
are ominous. There is no option
to forget or be blind. Every day is
a reminder.
Until this institution stops
blindly breeding privilege on top of
privilege, it will continue to run the
same course. Until then, there will
be no program to teach me and my
privileged peers of the impact of our
actions. It's upon us to unlearn and
to become aware of our identities.

The recently released results of the National
College Health Assessment indicate that, while
the University has met the Healthy Campus
2020 goals in various areas of health and
wellness, alcohol and substance abuse remains
a common detriment to students' overall health
and academic performance. Findings from
the study conducted by UHS suggest students
who reside off-campus are more likely to
demonstrate unhealthy drinking behaviors,
and a vast discrepancy exists between student
perceptions and the reality of alcohol and
substance use on campus. In order to improve
student health and promote healthy behaviors,
the University should modify currentprograms
and priotitize outreach efforts to students who
no longer reside on campus.
Increasing student education and awareness
would significantly alter current student
attitudes. According to the study, 96 percent
of undergraduate responders believe the
"typical" student uses alcohol one or more
days each month. However, only 70 percent of
undergrad respondents consumed alcohol at
least one day within the past month, meaning
there is a large, if unglamorized, community
of students who do abstain from drinking.
Students tend to overestimate the frequency
of usage for substances such as marijuana,
cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines. For
example, 87 percent of undergrads believe the
"typical" student uses marijuana at least once a
month, but the actual statistic suggests only 21
percent of the undergraduate population does
so. Exaggerated perceptions of alcohol and
substance use may cause students to feel social
pressure to participate in unhealthy behaviors.
While alcohol is a legal substance, the abuse of
alcohol, marijuana and other drugs poses both
health risks and legal consequences.
A high proportion of alcohol abuse occurs
within Greek Life. According to the study,
students who reside in a sorority or a fraternity
house were found to be more likely to drink
alcohol. The Interfraternity Council has
instituted new rules - such as a ban of hard
liquor at some open parties - in an attempt
to decrease alcohol abuse. However, the data
indicates more action may need to be taken.

The high alcohol usage rates may stem from
cultural pressures within the Greeksystem and
a possible lack of alcohol education. The Greek
community has institutional punitive policies
in place to protect the health ofits members,but
opaque and reactive procedures must be paired
with preventative and educational campaigns
to be effective. Regardless of the location and
host of Greek system parties, both sorority
and fraternity members exhibit unusually
high rates of alcohol usage. Therefore, it is
the responsibility of both the IFC and the
Panhellenic Association to implement a more
effective program to educate their members.
The issue of alcohol and substance abuse
is not limited to individuals within the Greek
system. Substance abuse is highly correlated
with living in a house or an apartment
located off-campus. The frequency of usage
among off-campus students as well as the
high percentage of students who reported
exceeding recommended blood alcohol
content levels during the last time they
drank suggests programs, such as Stay in
the Blue may not be effective enough. The
University can look to other schools to find
stronger initiatives to educate students,
and to curb dangerous behaviors such as
binge drinking. Frostburg State University,
for example, has been able to decrease the
number of students who partake in binge
drinking from 57 percent to 41 percent since
2006. To do so, Frostburg State implemented
more Friday morning classes and created
social media campaigns to provide students
with insightful, approachable information
regarding the prevalence of drinking
on campus.
In order to improve the health, safety and
academic success of students, the University
should seek to build upon the methods it uses
to deter students from high-risk behaviors.
While there are efforts to curtail alcohol
and substance abuse among students in
residential halls, a more comprehensive
program must be created to ensure off-
campus students possess the knowledge to
avoid unhealthy behaviors throughout the
duration of their college careers.

STUDENTS FOR CHOICE I
Sharing stories, ending stigma

One in three women* will have an abortion
in her lifetime.
Despite the deep political entrenchment of
the abortion debate in American politics, we
never seem to talk about the fact that abortion
is a common experience among American
women. We don't talk about abortion: We
legislate it, regulate it, define what it is and
isn't and what it should and shouldn't mean.
Abortion is a reality for one-third of
American women. Rather than existing as
an individual experience, abortion is too
often examined and dissected through a
framework of politics and cultural standards
that trap women who have had abortions in
a double bind. On one hand, when a woman
is relieved after having an abortion, she is
often vilified on a personal and societal level
as being heartless or accused of repressing
her "true feelings." On the other hand, if a
woman experiences even the slightest regret
of her abortion, anti-choice activists will use
her narrative as a tool to advance restrictive
policies that police women's access to
abortion care. In the midst of this political
trivialization and cultural classification of
a person's lived experience, individuals'
abortion stories are effectively silenced.
Stigma exists on all levels: individual, com-
munity, institutional, legal and in the media.
This stigma is pervasive, and we can identify
it at all of these levels. For example, myths of
the danger of abortion circulate (when in fact
legal abortions are actually safer than child-
birth) and women who have had abortions
experience shame, guilt, marginalizationand
are labeled either victims or promiscuous.
Likewise, abortion providers are stigmatized.
Research conducted at this very University
has linked consciousness clauses - which

permits doctors to opt out of performing
abortions - to the stigmatization of abor-
tion providers who are often stereotyped as
incompetent physicians. Providers may also
fear for their physical safety as a result of the
stigma: Since 1993, eight clinic workers have
been murdered.
As you can see, this stigma affects people's
lives. These are women in our University
community. One in three isn't just a statistic;
it's a representation of all the women in your
life who have had abortions but have not been
given the opportunity to talk about them.
Every time an anti-abortion law is proposed,
every time a group of anti-abortion activists
stands in front of a clinic entrance with signs
that shame individuals who have abortions,
we're shaming one third of our nation's women
for a choice that they made about their lives.
We're effectively telling women who have had
abortions - and women who are goingto have
abortions - that their experience is invalid,
and that the choice they made about their
pregnancy is shameful.
It's our duty as youngpeople who care about
the safety and well being of our community
to amplify the voices of individuals who have
had abortions by creating a space for them
to share their stories free of the shame and
stigma that currently surrounds abortion.
We're reclaiming our voices and telling our
stories so that women around the nation can
tell theirs too. Not only do we hope that the
sharing of personal abortion stories finally
puts an end to the stigmatization of abortion,
but we hope that it mobilizes abortion
supporters to advocate for safe, legal and
affordable abortion care.

The term "transparency" is
beyond a buzzword. It gets
tossed around way more
than it should -
transparency this,
transparency that.
The problem is ^
I've never under-
stood why people
make such a big
deal about trans-
parency. No, I'm DEREK
not an advocate of WOLFE
extreme secrecy
or anything of the
like. Rather, I don't understand why
"being transparent" should be such
a selling point for new leadership
in the public sector - for example,
President Barack Obama promising
greater government transparency
back in 2008 before he was elected.
Shouldn't it be a fundamental
element of basically every
public institution?
What got me thinking about
this again was Sunday's episode
of "Last Week Tonight," hosted by
John Oliver. Oliver ran a five-and-
a-half-minute segment on the fact
that the Supreme Court does not
allow television cameras during
oral arguments. Besides creating
an elaborate and adorable setup of
dogs dressed in judicial robes to play
over the audio of Supreme Court
proceedings, the segments brought
to mind an important point. When
it's so easyto bring in cameras and be
a little more transparent, then why
go through the hassle of explaining
whyyou don't do it? Because it seems
to me that many scandals occur or
grow larger than they should solely
because of a refusal to be transparent
and open about whatyou're doing.
Case in point, the University of
Michigan Athletic Department.

While already covered extensively
by The Michigan Daily and needs no
further explaining, the communi-
cation after the Shane Morris inci-
dent was despicable. Why on earth
would they release a statement at 1
a.m.? I don't care how many hands
it went through. It appeared that the
department was attempting to avoid
backlash by posting a release in the
middle of the night.
That being said, this all could have
been prevented, or at least slightly
alleviated, with some transparency.
If it's really taking so long to write a
statement, then consider releasing an
update earlier in the evening stating
something alongthe lines of, We're in
the process of composing a statement.
We apologize for the amount of time
this is taking and expect it to be com-
pleted within the next couple of hours.
Simply explaining where you are
in a process would go a long way.
And it appears that the Athletic
Department may be learning its
lesson, showing a minor sign of
improvement with last Thursday's
announcement of lower football
ticket prices next season. Without
even providing specific details, just
by saying the price will be lower
shines light into their operations and
comforts the consumer. Was that so
hard, Dave Brandon?
The University's Medical School
is perhaps the most transparent
organization in the University sys-
tem, specifically with their admis-
sions process. The admissions
department is constantly updat-
ing their admission statistics with
information such as how many
interviews and admissions have
been offered as well as the aver-
age GPA and average MCAT scores
of the incoming class to this point.
While I'm not applying to the Uni-

versity Medical School this cycle,
I would posit that this openness is
highly appreciated by applicants
and works to prevent any public
relations issues that could arise.
The only problem is that this
appears to be an anomaly atthe Uni-
versity, at least from an administra-
tive angle. Lack of transparency is
an institutional problem. The high
cost and time it takes to acquire
documents through the Univer-
sity's Freedom of Information Act
Office tells you all you need to know
about the University's attitude
toward transparency.
Most of all, it displays a sort
of arrogance among University
leadership that is concerning. Itsays
to the public that they're not worthy
of knowing certain information that
isn't even detrimental. It's difficult
to want to associate myself with
leaders who feel that way about the
people they work for.
Besides the ticket price
announcement, the first three
months of University President
Mark Schlissel's tenure have been
more of the same. I recognize
that some things need to be kept
under wraps, but that should be
the minority of issues. There is an
obligation to the people to educate
them about what is happening atthe
University. And the more you share,
the more of a chance you're giving
people to invest themselves in the
University. Isn't that what you want,
a bigger brand, right?
What's the big secret anyways?
Because if you're worried about us
finding out that there actually isn't
a pot of gold under the Union, we
already knew that.

poetry and
fiction, was
centrally concerned with how
theater can serve as the venue for
questions of identity, genre and
writing in general, rather than giv-
ing audiences bland, naturalistic
morality plays as was the domi-
nant practice at the time (and the
belief for many today as well in the
United States).
Theatre de la Ville, which has
gone by a number of names since
its establishment in 1862, was built
as one of the modernizing proj-
ects of pioneering architect Baron
Haussmann and stands as one of
the premiere dramatic institu-
tions of the Francophone world. In
an interview with The Michigan
Daily, Emmanuel Demarcy-Mota,
the company's director, discussed
the intellectual and aesthetic
labor that has gone into Theatre
de laVille's productionofthis play.
Michael Chase, one of the compa-
ny's administrators, translated the

interview between English and
French.
"It is one of the greatest plays
of the twentieth (century), a play
that brought a breach in European
dramaturgy. And what I'm inter-
ested in today, as I've been in love
with the art of theater since child-
hood, is how the play is an homage
to theater, the strength of imagi-
nation and the cruelty of life,"
Demarcy-Mota said.
Pirandello's play is a metathe-
atrical exploration of the pos-
sibilities and impossibilities of
theatrical production, focusing on
the six characters' confrontation
with their distance from their
roles as actors when they break
into a rehearsal of another play of
Pirandello's.
"I first produced the play in
2001 with the same actors, and
we've worked a lot on the depth
of the play - tragic character,
anguish, anxiety and at the same
time the comical - to try to make
the spectator understand and
show the audience how Pirandello
goes very deep into the human
soul," Demarcy-Mota said. "The
most difficult part for the actors
was to accept all the conflicts that
are in the play."
These conflicts concern the
relationship between director and
character, character and char-
acter and actor and character. In
this way, Pirandello provides the
framework for the characters to
work through their conflicts in
the simultaneously empowering
and anxiety-inducing borderlands
between character and character
or character and actor. Such a
skeletal account can do no justice
to Pirandello's gymnastic naviga-
tion and manipulation of the roles
of director, actor and character
that so many have been content to
see as stable or self-evident.

"The theme of theater within
theater allows us to deal with the
comedic aspects because it cre-
ates distance, which allows us to
see actors who are attempting to
play a character and their fail-
ure, which is terrible but funny
at same time. The comedy comes
from the tragedy; it is not separate
from the tragedy," Demarcy-Mota
said.
Pirandello was a playwright
who reveled in making these
kindsofcontradictions come alive
on the stage. And while the play
interests itself in understanding
the sorts of abstract categories
of self, tragedy, comedy, charac-
ter and performance, it is equally
interested in working through
trauma and violence, some of the
very emotional matter of everyday
life. The play concerns itselfin par-
ticular with an instance of sexual
violence between the Father and
the Stepdaughter.
"He (Pirandello) poses the ques-
tion of truth and reality as a theo-
retician creating fiction. Finally,
like Brecht, he writes fiction but is
posing questions about the theater.
'What is a character,' 'what is a
drama,"whatis atragedy'- within
these questions, he will build work
in which the greatest fantasies, the
greatest anxieties, the misunder-
standings between the people and
the dimensions of the impossibil-
ity of living together will appear,"
Demarcy-Motasaid.
For all of our community's the-
ater-goers, enthusiasts of twenti-
eth century literature and anyone
who wants to learn more about
theater, Theatre de la Ville's per-
formance of one of Pirandello's
theatrical masterworks will not
disappoint in its prompting of
questions that strike to the very
heart ofunderstanding oneself as a
self that lives among others.

You+Me find
folk success on
'rose ave.

Alecia Moore, better
known as pop/rock star P!nk,
and Dallas Green, better
known as
City and
Colour,
have come rose ave.
together
as You+Me You+Me
and RCA
created
an eye-
opening folk album, rose
ave. Considering the recent
obsession with EDM,
many might not consider
themselves fans of folk, but
after listening to Moore and
Green's harmonious duets,
music fans will be begging for
less bass and auto-tune and
more banjos.
Following, yearsi of
friendship, Moore and Green
finally found' 'themselves
with open schedules this past
March and began to work
together on a track or two.
Somehow, they ended their

short time together with an
entire album. But, their lack
of time spent on the record
did not sacrifice an ounce of
quality.
"Capsized" opens the
album with haunting vocals
overlaying a single guitar beat,
leaving listeners humming its
chorus long after the album
is over. What follows the
opening, though, is no less
impactful. Each track brings
out a different hue of emotion.
"From a Closet in Norway,"
poses questions about life,
before "Gently" can lull
listeners into a state of
comfort. But on the emotional
rollercoaster that is rose ave,
that comfort only lasts as
long as the track. You+Me
quickly move on to the most
memorable break-up ballad
in recent history. "Love
Gone Wrong," captures the
emotional back-and-forth
of the end of a relationship,
even more so than "Just Give
Me a Reason," a number one
from P!nk's previous solo
album. It pays respect to the,,
fact that no one is blameless,
and stylistically 'conveys the
message gracefully through
the unified climax.
The album moves from the
dynamics of a break-up to the

dynamics of love with "You
and Me." What's so special
about the track is how it
captures the essence of all
types love. It isn't written
distinctly for a lover; it can
be applied to friendship or
family. Even more important
than love itself, the song
emphasizes the importance of
being in tandem with others.
It's no wonder why this song
coincides with the duos stage
name: It captures the essence
of their entire musical style.
After a few forgettable
tracks, the violin of "Break
the Cycle" brings the record
back to life. A song written
for P!nk's mother, "Break the
Cycle," is another emotional
climax, and will resonate with
anyone on some level. The
album's closer, "No Ordinary
Love," juxtaposes slow verses
with a heart-wrenching
chorus, solidifying that this is
no ordinary record.
Moore and Green have
produced a folk album capable
of eliciting emotions listeners
didnot know they contained.
While there is a.handful of
filler tracks, You+Me's vocal
harmony and minimalist
approach piece together a
folk album which may bring
the genre back to pop culture.

Little Big Town's
sixth studio album
lives up to past hits
ByCHRISTIAN KENNEDY
For The Daily
Coming from someone with
Ok a fresh tattoo and rook pierc-
ing, country group Little Big
Town's
sixth stu-
dio album,
Pain Killer Pain Killer
lived up to
its name. Little Big Town
It certainly Capitol Nashville
numbed my
pain. Little
Big Town has slam-dunked a
record full of range, and done
what the group does best:
country summer jams.
LBT opens with "Quit
Breaking Up With Me," the
best track by a considerable
margin, with lyrics featur-
ing a strong Southern drawl
and calling in the humor from
previous number-one coun-
try hit, "Pontoon." And light-
ning certainly strikes twice; I
mean, "I'm the only one that
will put up with your censor-
ship"? It's redneck genius,
only reachable by Little Big
Town. The lead single, "Day
Drinking," speaks for itself.
After debuting in June, it still
has me ready to crack a beer

at noon.
"Pain Killer" was a solid
choice for the title track.
Backed by a rolling beat, it
demands to be swayed to at
every show. Plus, all of the
"la's" in the bridge deserve at
least an enthusiastic mouth-
ing (or shouting, if fans also
started drinking at noon).
Karen Fairchild sings,
"Yeah, I wanna taste her lips
... " *Head tilts* " ... because
they taste like you." OK,
now it makes sense. Not that
there is anything wrong with
a country-lesbian love song
sung by a female member mar-
ried to her male band mate. It
just definitely would've been
a first. Nonetheless, it is the
highlight of the low-tempo
tunes.
"Faster Gun" builds up
throughout the chorus, but
in the end it doesn't deliver
much. But that's okay because
it leaves the floor open for
"Good People" to swing in and
kill it. It's catchy and true.
"Good People know good peo-
ple," but great people know
this song is gold.
Go to any hoedown in the
nextyear, and "Stay All Night,"
will be played. And if it isn't
you must leave immediately
because that is no hoedown
worth taking part in. This
track is a classic get-down-at-
the-hoedown jam, guitar solo
included. "Save Your Sin" has

pitchy verses that are tough to
follow, but its chanting chorus
makes for another notch on
LBT's pain-killing belt.
The emotional pit of the
album comes with "Live For-
ever." Emotion is not exactly
the defining feature in Little
Big Town albums, but this
track is the album's first vocal
collaboration between male
and female Little Big Tow-
nees, and its a cappella verse
is close to musical magic.
"Things You Don't Think
About," is a mix of dirty south
and southern choir. The hook
(which is one of the best coun-
try hooks of late) puts fire in
the eyes, while the chorus
brings in the mist. Following
a (rather boring) instrumental
opening, the beat of "Turn the
Lights On," drops and it had
me throwing myself at every
light switch in sight. Where
the track starts and ends are
night and day. And it's hard
to understand why the album
closes with "Silver and Gold."
It's an OK love song, but cer-
tainly no way to close a record
like "Pain Killer."
Nonetheless, Pain Killer, in
short, killed it. By the time is
was finished, my tattoo was
at ease and my ear was so
pleased, even with a metal bar
through it. Little Big Town
has done it again, and have
cemented their place in coun-
try music royalty.

ing, and
where's the drama without the
sex? From Samantha's outra-
geous pursuits in "Sex and
the City" to Blair and Serena's
lusty endeavors in "Gossip
Girl," viewers are seduced by
the scandalous glamour of it
all.
There comes a point,
though, where even the scan-
dals become tedious: another
flawlessly beautiful girl sleeps
with Mr. Brooding-and-Dam-
aged from the swanky, dimly-
lit bar. So what? It seems that
the tired sphere of dramatic
television is in desperate need
of a shake-up, which is where
"Jane the Virgin" steps in.
In the CW's new show, new-
comer actress Gina Rodri-
guez plays Jane Villanueva, a
23-year-old girl whose char-
acter stands in stark con-

trast to all of the Samanthas
and Serenas on TV. Instead
of lying around a penthouse
apartment, Jane is studying
to be a teacher and working at
a hotel, living with her Span-
ish-speaking grandmother
(Ivonne Coll, "Switched at
Birth") and her young, sin-
gle mother (Andrea Navedo,
"White Collar"). Rather than
attending elaborate brunches,
the three women spend their
time indulging in telenovelas
and grilled cheese. In a pool of
impossibly tall and statuesque
female characters, Jane is the
busty and bashful odd fish out,
who also happens to be a vir-
gin.
Though the show lays the
grounds for a dramatic Cin-
derella story turn-around, it
doesn't happen - at least not
in the way the viewer expects.
The pilot opens with a flash-
back to a discussion between
10-year-old Jane and her
grandmother about'-chastity;
by crumpling a flower, the
grandmother demonstrates
that once a girl loses her vir-
ginity, it can never be restored.
Jane takes her grandmother's
message to heart, despite her
own mother's persistent eye-
rolling, and keeps the crum-
pled flower framed above her
bed like a purity ring. The
flower's omnipresence is par-
ticularly felt by her boyfriend
of two years (Brett Dier), who
is understanding about her
decision, yet frustrated with
not being able to consummate
their relationship.
Naturally, chaos ensues
when Jane discovers that she's
pregnant. When the doctor

arrives with the news, Jane
and her mother promptly
erupt into hysterical laughter;
"I'm a virgin," Jane says. They
repeat the test; it's positive
again. Jane is confounded, her
mother believes that Jane's a
prophet, and her grandmother
assumes that she broke her
purity pact. To make matters
worse, Jane's boyfriend has
decided to propose, and she
now has to confess that she's
expecting a child.
Who's the daddy? None other
than Jane's boss, Rafael (Justin
Baldoni), the young and rich
"trapped husband" of a schem-
ing wife, and coincidentally the
man whom Jane had a summer
fling with as a teenager. So is
it a Cinderella story? Not quite
- it turns out that Rafael has
cancer, and the only way for
his wife to become pregnant is
by artificial insemination, but
because of a patient mix-up by
the distracted OB-GYN, Jane is
inseminated instead of Rafael's
wife.
Suddenly, Jane's life is like a
telenovela. After years of disci-
pline to build a future different
from her mother's, she's now
carrying a child out of wed-
lock, one that doesn't even
belong to her fiance, but may
be Rafael's only chance to have
a kid. A sort of everything-
happens-for-a-reason theme
is played out: even though the
baby is an accident, Jane her-
self was an "accident," and she
can't imagine not giving the
baby the same chance she had.
"Jane" is complicated, soapy
and at times completely over
the top, but it works. Who
knew virgins could be so fun?

It's tiring to see movies that

beautiful (
if done
properly, The
but it can'tD
be forced. isappearance
Especially of Eleanor
when you're Rigby: THEM
dealing with
a movie that The Michigan
looks at the Theater
evolution of The Weinstein
young love Company
and how
its thrill
vanishes when replaced by
the deep pain of loss. Emotion
needs to pour out of such films,
it needs to be raw and out there
for the audience to experience
and to feel, not buried deep
under pages of dialogue and
astute camerawork that few
people care about.
Movies should strive for
empathy, not sympathy.
Granted, this doesn't always

work because different movies
need to be handled differently,
but it's pretty evident that
"The Disappearance of Eleanor
Rigby: THEM," directed by
newcomer Ned Benson, could
have done with a lot less beating
around the bush.
The story, a pared-down
combination of the "Him/
Her" films that studied each
character separately, follows
Eleanor Rigby (Jessica
Chastain, "Zero Dark Thirty")
and Connor (James McAvoy, "X
Men: Days of Future Past"), a
young couple that goes through
a crisis in their relationship
when their son dies. Eleanor
abandons Connor and goes to
live with her parents. Connor
eventually tracks her down to
deal with their problems and
try to to move past an obstacle
that apparently dealt a fatal
blow to their relationship.
This could have been a story
about love, loss, compromise
and strength, the things that
real relationships are supposed
to be made of, but it just doesn't
take off. The actors' talent is
wasted and they're hardly given
any meaningful dialogue to
work with. Intimate scenes that
delve into the tenderness of the
characters' relationships are
beautiful when fully explored,
but they're few and far between.

The relationship between
Eleanor and Connor is a very,
very slow dance to no music -
it's boringto watch and you just
don't seethe point of it.
S's easy to see the other
side of things and point out
that one cannot suddenly be
open and deal with such an
insurmountable loss for the
sake of making an engrossing
story. Real life isn't easy and
emotion doesn't pour out of
every sentence and interaction.
Situations do get complicated
and sometimes they get so bad
that people just don't know what
to do. But "Disappearance"
mishandles even those real-
life struggles. Characters move
from one event to the next
as if the events themselves
aren't even connected, with no
apparent consequences.
This is an especially
frustrating film to watch
because you know that it has
the potential to be great. All
the tools are there - the talent
of the actors, the possibility of a
unique story - but they're just
not used to said potenital. Just
like Connor, who is frustrated
with watching his wife live
through her problems without
talking to him, viewers are
bound to be discontented with
this film because it just won't
speak to them.

But in truth,
the movie is a charming and
colorful tribute to Hispanic
culture.
In a screenplay co-written
by director Jorge R. Gutierrez
("El Tigre: The Adventures of
Manny Rivera"), a young man
named Manolo (Diego Luna,
"Casa de mi Padre") is torn

Call:s#734-418-4115
Email: dailydisplay@gmail.com

between his duty to honor
his family's legacy as a bull-
fighter and his love of the gui-
tar. His best friend, Joaquin
(Channing Tatum, "22 Jump
Street"), is a macho soldier
whose father was a fallen gen-
eral. Both boys live under the
shadows of their fathers. The
movie revolves around "Mano-
lo versus Joaquin for the hand
of Maria," a crass prostitute
(Zoe Saldana, "Avatar") who is
the most famous female char-
acter in Miguel de Cervante's
work.
Fantastic figures from
Hispanic folklore become
involved in the game. La
Muerte (Kate del Castillo, "No
Good Deed") and Xibalba (Ron
Perlman, "Hellboy") are the
rulers of the two underworlds.
La Muerte bets that Manolo
will win Maria, and Xibalba
bets that Joaquin will. What
follows is a classic high-stakes
Mexican standoff, in which
the tides rise and fall in favor
of our hero, Manolo. He wins
our hearts over as a young boy,
when he gives bread to an old
beggar as his family is gath-
ered around his late mother's
grave on the Day of the Dead.
She prays that his heart be
"always pure and good," a
prayer that comes full circle.
Maria, when she leaves for
Spain at the start of the story,
gives him a guitar that reads
"Always play from the heart."
Manolo follows that message
without fail. The songs he
sings are touchingly poetic,
in classic mariachi style. He
sings to Maria in the moon-
light as she watches from the
balcony, impressed but always
so elegant. When he leans in
for a kiss, she turns him away.
"Did you think it was going to
be that easy?" she says play-
fully.
Though Maria respects her
father's wishes and her fam-
ily's traditional values, she
isn't afraid to stand up for
herself. She challenges her
expected role as a cook and a
cleaner. In her time in Spain,
we learn that she has learned
"Art, music, books!" Not least
surprising is that they seem
to have taught her kung-fu at
an eighteenth-century Span-
ish convent (co-writer Doug
Langdale did work on TV's
"Kung Fu Panda: Legends of
Awesomeness"). All told, if the
audience can find but one flaw
in the story, it's that charac-
ters like Maria do not have sat-

isfying arcs. As much of a role
model as she is, she doesn't
evolve over the course of the
story. She is not like Manolo,
who challenges the tradition
that "Music is not worthy of
a Sanchez bullfigher," refuses
to kill the bulls he is made to
fight and in doing so becomes
the greatest bullfighter in the
Sanchez line.
The film should be appre-
ciated not for the arcs of its
individual characters, but for
its color and the breathtak-
ing scope of its storylines and
themes. The film speaks to
bullfighting, mariachi, femi-
nism, death, camaraderie, love,
tradition, honor, family, cour-
age, sincerity, all warped so
dazzlingly together in a mem-
orable coming-of-age story ...
which may, admittedly, be a
little too dazzling for some.
We are given spectacular tours
of Land of the Remembered
and the Land of the Forgot-
ten. Ice Cube ("Are We There
Yet?") adds a comedic but very
symbolic role as the Candle-
Maker and the keeper of the
Book of Life. He does for "The
Book of Life" a touch of what
Robin Williams did for "Alad-
din" as Genie. Every life is a
candle, he explains, and when
a life is taken away, its candle
is put out. There is depth in
every symbol of the film, for
audiences of all ages.
No children's movie should
be so ambitious, and yet "The
Book of Life" seems to have
pulled it off. Producer Guill-
ermo del Toro does well, as is
his trademark style, to bring
up macabre themes like death
with a young audience. With
Halloween coming up, we lose
sight of the real significance
of the holiday, its roots in the
memory of the loved ones who
have left us.
Perhaps the film's narrative
success lies in its framing the
story of Manolo and Joaquin
within a field trip to a muse-
um. The teacher shows the
white American school kids
the Book of Life and animates
the stories with wooden figu-
rines, a new twist on anima-
tion informed by traditional
Mexican aesthetics. Every
now and then we take an
amusing break from the story,
and the kids make a comment
like "What is it with Mexicans
and death?"
And then we resume in the
most poetic of ways ... "As the
sky cried with rain..."

CL HOCKFY
Defense sparks offense
early in season for 'M'

r Devin Funchess doesn't thinkof Saturday's game against Michigan State as anything more than a game.
Lensity no different

If you want to get a sense of
where the Michigan football
team's rivalry with Michigan
State stands in 2014, take a look
at these two quotes from both
sides.
From Spartan coach Mark
Dantonio,astoldtoMLiveduring
a Tuesday press conference:
"This (Michigan) is still the most
important game on the schedule
for me, personally and for our
program.Whenyou compete day
in and day out with them - and
that's what we do for recruits
- day in and day out, for fans,
for everything, it carries over
to volleyball, basketball, carries
over to everything."
And from- Michigan junior
wide receiver.Devin Funchess on
Tuesday: "I mean, it's a rivalry
week, but we take it as just
another week on the schedule."
It's a game that stretches back
107 years, includes bragging
rights spanning an entire state
for a year and is full of plenty
of smack talk. in 2007, former
runningback Mike Hart referred
to Michigan as "Little Brother."
Just last year, former offensive
lineman Taylor Lewan said
Michigan State "bullied" the
Wolverines.

There's a spot for the Paul
Bunyan Trophy - awarded
annually to the winner of the
in-state rivalry game - in
Schembechler Hall with an
etching that says it will return
this year. The game is generally
on national television because it
draws such a large crowd.
But now, the rivalry that
has always been marked on
everyone's calendar is hyped up
by one team publicly and not the
other.
"It gets in your blood a little
bit," Dantonio said Tuesday.
"There's no difference in
this game than the South
Carolina-Clemson game when
I was in college (playing for the
Gamecocks). It divides the state,
and it makes it unique in that
respect."
Added Spartan quarterback
Connor Cook: "The hits are
always bigger, the plays are
always bigger. There is pushing
and shoving after the whistle,
but the energy is just always that
much more in this game."
But the overwhelming
sentiment frominside Michigan's
camp, as if it were read from
a script, isn't buying into the
intensity surrounding it. Players
say it's about treating Saturday
like any other game.
Given the Spartans are the No.

8 team in the country, that could
have more meaning for a team
that has struggled to a3-4 record
this season.
"We definitely have to prepare
like it's just another game," said
sophomore quarterback Jourdan
Lewis. "It is a big rivalry, but we
just have to step it up."
Added junior linebacker Joe
Bolden: "Every week we practice
with the intentions of winning,
so I would say no (Saturday's
game isn't different)."
Perhaps the comments are
meant to avoid saying anything
too provocative, the type of stuff
that ends up running on TV over
and over.
But more often than not,
Lewan's comments aside,
indifference has been the theme
for Michigan in the past seven
years. Michigan State is 5-1 since
Hart's comments. They're slowly
chipping away at the Wolverines
68-33-5 all-time record in the
series.
The attitude, if anything, is
indicative of how they've played,
lacking the intensity that's very
evident 65 miles away.
If last year's 29-6 dismantling
in East Lansing, which included
Michigan rushing for minus-48
yards, isn't enough to make it
"more than a game" in 2014, it's
tough to imagine what is.

By ERIN LENNON
Daily Sports Writer
Cutler Martin watched his
shotdeflectoffaNewHampshire
skater, stood tall and pointed at
his teammates. The freshman
defenseman's first goal, in his
collegiate debut no less, would
become the go-ahead goal in the
No. 10 Michigan hockey team's
first victory of the season.
For Martin, the first tally
was the figurative monkey off
his back, but for ateam that has
struggled to put the puck in the
net, it was the difference in the
game. And it was an indication
that, if nothing else, the defense
can and will score.
In fact, the only two players
to find the back of the net on
Saturday were defensemen - an
accomplishment the Wolverines
couldn't point to last year.
Last season, the defense
accounted for four of the
Wolverines' 107 goals - two
goals apiece from then-senior
defenseman Mac Bennett and
freshman Michael Downing -
and struggled to create offense
for its forwards. Defense,
by and large, was also the
reason Michigan finished a
disappointing year with just 26
power-play goals.
Just three games in to the
nonconference schedule,
Michigan defensemen have
contributed more offense than
the unit did in 35 games last
season. Though the stats are
unofficial, freshman Zach
Werenski's pair of tallies,
combined with two goals from
defensemen Saturday, equals
the Wolverines' 2013-14 total.
In Michigan's own zone, the
difference between Friday's
embarrassing 5-1 loss and
Saturday's win was also defense.
Backed by junior goaltender
Steve Racine - who made his
first start since March 8 - the
Wolverines fended off four New
Hampshire power plays and

looked faster in transition.
"Our team's still figuring it
out," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson. "I think they realized
that with a more focused
approach, playing the right kind
of hockey, it'll help our team...
We're not there yet, but we
competed harder and better.
"We didn't give up much, and
that helped us."
Saturday, Downing switched
over to play right side on the
top line alongside Werenski.
Downing played his entire first
year on the left side, recording
one of the best games in his class.
Comfort in his position on ice,
as well as with Werenski, will
take time.
Last season, Downing and
BennetttookuntillateDecember
to build the chemistry they
maintained through March.
After that point, the duo became
Michigan's most reliable pair.
"It's kinda something that
takes a decent amount of time to
get used to," Downing said. "I've
been with three different guys
now, and it's just one of those
things. ... It takes a while."
In addition to size and power,
a Werenski-Downing line could
provide Michigan with the most
scoring potential from the blue
line. Werenski scored two goals
in an exhibition against Wilfred
Laurier, and Downing's tally,
Saturday showed improvement
in the offensive aspect of his
game.
Sometimes, more than shot
adjustments, scoring from the
point is as simple as keeping
one's head up.
"We've gotta find lanes,"
Downing said. "I don't think
it was so much that we weren't
getting pucks through, I think it
was just that we didn't work on
it enough. This year we stress it
a lot more.
"We can't get shots blocked.
It's on us."
The unit has also gotten a
boost, both this season and last,

from senior Andrew Sinelli.
Though he dressed as a forward
last week, Sinelli's versatility
makes him an offensive
threat both on offense and as
a defenseman. Sinelli spent
the majority of last season on
defense, adding a hat trick, and
saw time on Michigan's third
line on Saturday.
Still, on any given night,
Michigan's top two defensive
pairings comprise three
sophomores and a freshman
whose age suggests he should
still be in high school. That
means leadership is the job of
more than just seniors Mike
Chaisson and Brennan Serville,
but of players like Downing and
sophomore Kevin Lohan.
"I like kind of being the first
guy to go (on the ice), because
that's how it was with (Bennett)
last year and it's something I'm
used to," Downing said. "I want
to be a leader on the back end,
and I think I am."
For Michigan, winning in
the circle is just as much an
offensive opportunity as it is a
defensive victory. Simply put, a
faceoff win takes pressure off
the defense, especially late in
games.
While faceoff battles were
split almost evenly on Friday,
the home team capitalized
on twice as many chances as
the Wildcats on Saturday, a
stat Berenson attributed the
Wolverines' first win.
"For example, if you dropped
yourpurse,and(someonebigger)
tried to pick it up and run away
with it, you'd do everything you
could," Berenson said. "You'd
kick and scratch and claw, and
so on. That's what faceoffs
are. We need people who are
desperate in faceoffs, and who
can't wait for the battle."

TurgeonembracingBig 10 slate
By DANIEL FELDMAN
DailySports Writer
Mark Turgeon has felt like an
outsider the last two years in the
Atlantic Coast Conference.
Since the University of s
Maryland Board of Regents
voted on Nov. 19, 2012 to leave \Xk
the ACC and join the Big Ten,
the Terrapins' basketball coach
has been preparing for the jump
so much, he didn't even feel like
a member.
"To be honest with you, I
felt like we were in the Big Ten
the last few years," he said last
Thursday at Big Ten Basketball
Media Day. "As soon as we
announced we were leaving, we
were gone. We were physically
playing in the ACC, but not a lot
of teams liked us."
Turgeon has been watching '
Big Ten games for two years,
not two months, to prepare
for the switch. Describing the
experience as "overwhelming,"
Turgeon had a heavy load of
film to watch - half footage on PAUL SHERMAN/Dail
the season going on and half for Remember this guy? It's former Michigan forward Evan Smotrycz, who will be playing against his former team this year.

games more than a year in the
future.
"We've done film study on
every team in the league last
year, even though they might
have lost four seniors or changed
their plays," Turgeon said. "We
did multiple film studies and put
a scouting report together on
each of those teams like we were
going to play them that week."
Though the workload has
been heavy, Turgeon described
the new scouting as "fun." But if
there was any particular aspect
of the transition that was rough
for Turgeon and Maryland, it
was spending a season waiting to
exit the ACC.
"People thought I wasn't

excited about moving to the Big
Ten," Turgeon said. "It was going
through the process of getting
to the Big Ten that was really
hard, and not a lot of fun. I'm
not saying the ACC did anything
to deliberately hurt us, and they
didn't. You just knew you weren't
really part of the family anymore.
It's understandable. We made the
decision to leave."
With that long-awaited
departure finally complete,
Turgeon set deadlines to be
as prepared as his team could
be entering the season. To
complement all the video his
staff has watched, Turgeon has
set a goal of Nov. 1 to have all Big
Ten scouting reports done. With

"seven or eight" teams finished
before last Thursday, Turgeon is
on track to be finished before the
first exhibition game tips off.
The extra time will help the
Terrapin staff come February,
according to Turgeon, when
Maryland is in the middle of
its conference schedule and
recruiting is in its critical stage.
Additionally, current fifth-
year senior and former Wolverine
forward Evan Smotrycz's
knowledge of the conference will
come in handy for Maryland once
it is in the heart of Big Ten play.
"We'll rely a lot on Evan this
year," Turgeon said. "He's been
out of it for two years, and I'm
sure it's changed. Personnel has

definitely changed. I'll rely on
Evan a lot. He's an older, mature
guy. He's been around so we'll
talk a lot. We'll talk more this
year when we get closer to the
Big Ten about teams.
"He's a smart kid, smart
player, so I can rely on him in a
lot of areas."
And he's not worried about
losing rivals Duke and North
Carolina. He'll find new ones
soon enough.
"You replace Duke and
(North) Carolina with Ohio State
and Michigan State - it's pretty
impressive," he said. "Wisconsin,
Michigan, you know this league
can argue it's been the best
league in the country."

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily
Junior forward James Murphy and the offense, despite numerous chances, couldn't capitalize in Tuesday's draw.
'M' can't capitalize in tie

Michigan coach Chaka Daley gave sophomore forward Yamaan Sahlool a chance to start on Tuesday, and he rewarded
him with perhaps his best performance, coming close with Michigan's two best chances, despite the scoreless tie.
rare chance to start,
Sahlool stands out i*n tie

By MARK LAWSON
For the Daily
In many games, the difference
between celebrating a victory or
mourning a defeat often comes
down to the one play where the
ball happens to take a favorable
bounce.
On Tuesday night at U-M
Soccer Stadium, the Wolverines
never got their much-needed
bounce.
Michigan entered Tuesday
night's contest against Detroit-
Mercy looking find a rhythm on
offense after having an entire
week since its last game. The
extra time off didn't ignite the
dormant offense, though, as
the Wolverines couldn't find
the back of the net, leaving
them with a 0-0 tie after two
overtimes.
"I think it was a tale of
the same kind of story," said
Michigan coach Chaka Daley.
"We carried the game and
had all of the ball. In fairness
to them, they had some good
chances, but we carried the

game and just couldn't put the
ball in the net."
Though few in number,
there were still opportunities
for Michigan to get on the
scoreboard.In the 102nd minute,
redshirt junior midfielder Colin
McAtee, the team's top scorer,
had a solid angle on a shot until
a late deflection by Detroit sent
his shot just off the crossbar.
This, like other plays, was
another chance where Daley's
crew needed the bounce to go
its way.
"It was all right there for us,"
Daley said. "Off the hip, off the
knee, you need a lucky knee,
lucky toe, something like that to
change the game a little."
With offensive production
lacking, defense kept the
Wolverinies in the game the
entire time.
With 16 shots for the night,
Detroit's offense struggled
against Michigan defensemen,
allowing freshman goalie Evan
Louro to stop just four shots en
route to a shutout.
After 90 minutes of a

pure defensive struggle, the
Wolverines still were left with
two more overtime periods to
pull away with a win for the
night. Detroit was ready and
decided to pull back and play
for the tie rather the win, a
tactic Michigan has faced in the
past.
"They didn't look to play at
all," Daley said of the Titans'
overtime performance. "They
sat 11 guys behind the ball,
which is an awful way to play.
We have had three or four teams
have that exact same tactic."
Detroit's preventive
defense eventually led to an
anticlimactic ending, as the
Wolverines walked away with a
disappointingtie.
Still, Michigan will look to
finish the season strong as it
wraps up its last three Big Ten
games, starting with Indiana on
Sunday.
"We have to fight for our lives
to stay in the Big Ten race,"
Daley said. "We need to get our
mentality right. The Big Ten
seems to be everything now."

an opportunity to rotate the
squad and give some players an
impromptu audition.
"At our current state, nothing
is guaranteed to anybody,"
Daley said. "We wanted to
give some guys some more
time, because they've earned
it, and to see if they could offer
something to the team."
Sahlool hopes that his
performance Tuesday was
enough to convince his coach,
but he maintained that he could
still influence proceedings even
with a return to his substitute
role.
"I'm really happy, and I hope
I continue to start," Sahlool
said. "But if not, I'll always be
available off the bench."

This past Sunday morning I sat stationed at the end of the Detroit
Marathon course as thousands of runners crossed the finish line
after completing a 13.1- or 26.2-mile course. The runners trav-
eled across the Ambassador Bridge into Windsor, Ontario, along the
bank of the Detroit River, through the Detroit Windsor Tunnel. From
there, they ran along the streets of Mexicantown before heading down
East Lafayette toward Indian Village, onto Belle Isle and finally down
RiverWalk on the return to downtown. As thousands of runners crossed
under the arches showing their times, I was amazed by the spirit and
the energy of those who participated in the marathon or came to sup-
port their loved ones. Regardless of their finishing time, every runner's
face lit up in a sense of victory as they approached the last mile.

Jam a shopaholic.
OK, not in your conven-
tional sense, though. I've
never really spent more than I
knew I could afford, but there
have always been some things
that feel too hard to resist.
For the longest time, I fought
it. I loyally stuck to my mono-
chrome TCF bank card, convinc-
ing myself that a piece of plastic
with no annual fee and no inter-
est rates would really be all I
needed to sustain myself in col-
lege.
In some ways, I was right. I
wasn't making enough money to
convince myself that I could pay
back credit card debts even if I
wanted to. On top of that, there
was a certain discipline that
came with knowing I only had a
limited amount to spend - either
with cash in hand or balances
in my account - and I couldn't
exhaust acent more.
But as much as I fought it, I
eventually gave in. I got my new
and shiny clear-plastic Ameri-
can Express credit card in the
mail. "Be careful," my dad had
warned, convincing me that this
seemingly magical card would be
the one thing to move me entirely
into adulthood.
It was all a kick in the gut. I
finally had access to unlimited
money - up to my credit limit
allowed, at least - and it was
time to figure out how I wanted
to manage my money. Instead of
letting my new card rot in the

back-end of my wallet, I started
using it for frequent purchases.
So I learned to think before
you swipe, if you can't avoid it all
together.
Alarge share of credit card bal-
ances can come from the interest
that card companies charge on
outstanding debt at the end of
PAY ONLY FOR WHAT
YOU KNOW YOU
CAN AFFORD TODAY,
AND NOT FOR WHAT
YOU THINK YOU
WILL BE ABLE TO
TOMORROW.
each payment period - on top of
the debt itself. It's punishment,
really. But it's something you can
avoid. At the end of every month,
check on your credit debt and try
your best to wipe it clean, mak-
ing sure to leave nothing behind
lingering on your invoice.
There's a minimum payment
you'll need to make to appease
your card company, and then
there's the payment you should

make to keep your finances in
check.
It's not all a burden. Con-
sistently handling credit card
charges can go a long way toward
building your credit score. Main-
taining a high credit score can
help you qualify for low-interest
loans and future credit cards by
helping you validate your reli-
ability as a borrower. Thinking
several years down the road,
the ability to get mortgages and
large purchases such as cars at
low interest rates can go a long
way toward saving your future
wealth. College can be a great
place to start, since most of daily
consumption needs aren't neces-
sarily the most difficult to budget
and indemnify.
in fact, MarketWatch Finan-
cial Journalist Catey Hill called
credit cards "the worst way to
pay for college tuition," and in
some ways, she's right. Card com-
panies charge egregiously high
interest rates on revolving debt
- the debt that you keep pend-
ing on your account, month after
month. Compare the interest
rates that your card charges ver-
sus other loan options, and you'll
find yourself better off financing
your high-value purchases swith
other means of borrowing.
A credit card may act like a
lender, but it's far from a respon-
sible one. Pay only for what you
know you can afford today, and
not for what you think you will
be able to tomorrow.

stand in a small room of
doctors all dressed in crisp
white lab coats. It smells of
latex gloves, antiseptic, of heal-
ing wounds. It's my third week
at Respublikine Vilniaus Univer-
sitetine Ligonine - Vilnius Univer-
sity Hospital, in my home country
of Lithuania, where I'm shadow-
ing for the summer. I've seen more
than two-dozen head wounds so
far, several burns, countless bro-
ken bones, sprains and cuts. I'm
not afraid of the blood. I'm not
even afraid of dislocated joints.
But I am afraid of neurosurgery,
which is where I've been put for
the day.
I mean, what is neurosurgery
really? How much do we actually
know about the brain? The thought
of cutting into the most complex
and mysterious organ in the body
- of a living body, for that matter -
feels almost dehumanizing.
The head of surgery demands
yesterday's report. In the morn-
ing old cases are reviewed and
new cases introduced. I squint
intently at the PowerPoint from
the back corner of the room, try-
ing to understand the complicated
medical terminology. It's impos-
sible. The surgeon I shadow is
named Dr. Terbetas. He's assigned
a case coming in from a different
hospital. Something about a spinal
injury, I gather, and everyone dis-
perses.

I step into the congested wait-
ing room scanning for the patient.
In the corner sits an older man
and his son. Dressed neatly, flan-
nel button-downs tucked into off-
white slacks, they rise to shake my
hand.
"They sent us here from Tau-
rage," the son says. He has kind
eyes. "Nowhere else would take
him."
The father, Aleksandras, 84,
says he has no history of surger-
ies, diseases or broken bones. May
have broken his leg once at a high
school dance. Or maybe it was a
sprain.
"Old as the moon," says a nurse.
I scribble these details on the
chart. "How did the accident hap-
pen?" I ask.
"I had driven home from the
grocery store all by myself. I
stepped out of the car, took a few
steps and all of a sudden, I got real-
ly dizzy. Before you knew it, the
blocks of cement below me started
spinning and I must have fallen."
"We called the ambulance and
they took him to the hospital," says
the son. "There wasn't much they
could do there."
"They sent me here and gave me
this thing for my neck," says Alek-
sandras, pointing to the pathetic
brace wrapped around his neck. "A
week later, here we are."
Aleksandras had fractured the
dens of C2, the topmost vertebral

point of the spinal cord, joining
the skull and spine. Dr. Terbetas
explains it all to me, pointing to
the chipped bone floating on the
X-ray. Even with my basic under-
standing of neuro-anatomy, I can
tell this surgery is going to be dif-
ficult. Moving the broken bone a
millimeter in the wrong direction
would be fatal, and at his age, even
a successful surgery would not
guarantee that the bone would
grow and reconnect with the
spine.
Dr. Terbetas rushes off to see
another patient, and I wheel Alek-
sandras and his son to a room to
prepare for surgery.
"So are all doctors this young in
America, Dr. Tamkus?" Aleksan-
dras asks me in the elevator.
"You don't have to call me doc-
tor," I say, smiling. "I'm just a stu-
dent. Not even a medical student
- yet. But I hope to be."
"I was starting to think America
had really gone overboard with the
education thing if they were spew-
ing out doctors as young as you,"
Aleksandras says. I laugh. Talking
to him and his son is refreshing. I
spend the whole of my 20-minute
break chatting with them. I offer
to help Aleksandras unpack, but he
declines.
"He's very independent," the
son tells me. "His whole life he had
worked on his farm tending to the
cattle and horses, tending to the

crops. I had never seen a man love
what he does more than my father.
Two years ago on his birthday
we told him that he had worked
enough, that it was time for him to
settle down, because it would be
better for his health. I think that's
when he started getting old."
Aleksandras folds his striped
pajamas and places them on the
bed.
The ORis green - green scrubs,
green sterile cloths, green walls.
Two X-ray machines, a crash cart
and an acute physiologic system
tower over the gurney in the cen-
ter of the room where an anesthe-
tized body - Aleksandras - lies
on a table. It is bright and cold. The
mask traps my breath and warms
my face. Only the steady beeping of
the vitals machine interrupts the
silence of the room. The surgeon
asks for the scalpel.
It is a potent image - one human
operating on another. One standing
tall, tool in hand, the other lying
scared on a table. Commands roll
off the surgeon's tongue: Clamp.
Forceps. Scalpel. The life of the
patient lies at his fingertips.
OnlyAleksandras' neckisvisible.
It's almost as if he isn't there. Some-
times, I forget that he is. The ster-
ile clothes move up and down as he
breathes. I hold Aleksandras' hand.
Once the operation is complete,

I step out of the OR and tear off my
face mask. I breathe easier now. I
squint at the clock atthe end of the
hallway. Two in the morning. mes"
I head up to the break room
with the thought of laying on one
specific brown couch for a nap.
The elevator opens and I see the
son, holding his wearied head up
by his palms, body slouched. He
looks up to me with hopeful eyes.
"Saule, how was the surgery?"
I tell him we had to call in
another surgeon for help.tI tell
him they tried for hours. I tell him
Dr. Terbetas could not reach the
spine. With every sentence his face
falls. "It's not over," I add hastily.
"They are going to try to get to the
bone from the back. He just has to
recover."
We sit in silence. For 10 minutes,
for an hour. Time is not absolute,
especially in this place. After all, it
was just a few hours ago that I had
befriended these people.
They say emotional distance is
a sign of a good surgeon. But that
seems like a pipe dream. We get
satisfaction from helping people,
from knowing people, through 's
relationships, conversations. I'm
not sure I can do it, notyet.
I look up at Aleksandras' son. He
is asleep now, hunched over with
his face in his hands. I lean back in
my chair, and close my eyes too.
Saule Tamkus is an LSA Junior.

6B Wednesday October 22, 2014 // The Statement
What the 2014 enrollment data tells us about Detroit

by Will Greenberg

The numbers haven't changed much -
yet. But the University's pledge to build a
more diverse campus shows promise if the
school's efforts in Detroit are any indicator of
its national strategy.
The 2014 enrollment data for the Univer-
sity released Monday shows that this year's
freshmen class isn't much different from
that of the rest of the decade. According to
the University's Registrar reports, the Fall
2014 freshman class comprised of 3.84 per-
cent Black students - a drop from the Fall
2013 freshman class with 4.12 percent Black
students. Hispanic students also dropped to
4.48 percent from 4.72. The differences in
real numbers are small, with a difference of
six students for Black enrollment and two
students for Hispanic enrollment. The aver-
age undergraduate enrollment for these two
demographics has averaged at 4.65 percent
and 4.45 percent, respectively, over the past
five fall semesters.
Since being named the University's Presi-
dent last spring, Mark Schlissel has called
increasing the-currently stagnant minority
enrollment numbers as a priority. In the wake
of the historic ratz v. Bollinger case, which
banned affirmative action and the consider-
ation of race in college admissions starting in
2006, the University has attempted to recon-
cile a declining number of minority students
while maaining constitutional admissions

based programs such as Semester in Detroit
and has its own University admissions staff.
In fact, Wainaina personally knows Assistant
Admissions Director Delphine Byrd, and says
Byrd makes frequent appearances to Renais-
sance.
"U of M is always active," Wainaina said.
"Even though a lot of the colleges now are
coming up here, you still see a lot more of U of
M than you see even of (Michigan) State and
Bowling Green and everybody else."

in an e-mail interview that while Detroit
recruitment is not necessarily a new focus for
admissions, the Detroit Center has held more
frequent events for students and parents,
connecting them with guidance counselors
and emphasizing financial aid opportuni-
ties. Generally, Sanders said Detroit recruit-
ment involves a variety of visits, community
meetings, partnership meetings and other
outreach events, including an annual spring
forum during which DPS principals receive
feedback.

tions students have about admissions by pro-

Renaissance is one of the better perform-
ing schools in DPS, consistently sending over
95 percent of their students to college, accord-
ing to Jones. In 2012, Renaissance had the
second-highest high school graduation rate
in DPS with a rate of 95.47 percent. However,
this is far from the norm of DPS high schools,
the average in 2012 being 64.74 percent.
Renaissance is also a selective-enrollment
high school, meaning that while beinga pub-
lic school, students need a minimum level of
academic performance to secure admission.
Renaissance Principal Anita Williams said
she has been impressed with the involvement
and accessibility of University admissions
staff. A former assistant principal at Detroit's
Cass Technical High School, she lauded the
resources made available to Renaissance stu-
dents and has even seen evidence of outreach
to other DPS schools.
"They really care about the kids first," she
said, on the University's admissions staff.
"It didn't matter that it's Cass or it's Renais-
sance. I didn't see any difference in outreach;
I didn't see any difference in commitment."
While Williams and many of her students
have good standing with the University, the
same cannot be said across all Detroit high
school students.
Last spring, a By Any Means Necessary
protest highlighted the cases of four stu-
dents, three of them from schools in Detroit,
who were denied admission to the University._
The four students were members of minority
groups, two Black and two Hispanic, and the
protest called for the admissions office to be
more acti in recruiting minoities a dpro-

THE THOUGHT BUBBLE

the fashion voyeur:
know your socks!
BY MAX RADWIN


It's almost universally agreed
upon by fashionistas such
as myself that socks are the
most essential part of any per-
son's wardrobe. Don't be fooled
into thinking you can just throw
on a pair and rush out the door.
Chances are you put on the wrong
kind, and if your pant leg rides up
even a little while you're sitting
down, everyone is going to real-
ize how big a fool you are. I'm
telling you, guys - the last thing
you want is to look out of style.
You've got enough problems to
have socks slowing you down,

They scream, "I'm trying to seem

If I'm going out to the bars in

for those who look. And it's always carried
around by countless members of the Univer-
sity community on their clothes, phone cases
and keychains. It's the block 'M.'
More than100 years ago, during the home-

of solitary M mentioned, even though the
book has many logos and insignias for student
organizations and classes.
On Nov. 17, 1907, The Michigan Daily
reported that the previous day, the aforemen-
tioned thousands of flags were used to form an
