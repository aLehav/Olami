LEGAL DISPUTE
Shirvell's
request
dismissed
Judge denies request
to seal deposition
in former MSA
president's lawsuit
By PATRICIA SNIDER
Daily StaffReporter
Former Assistant Michi-
gan Attorney General Andrew
Shirvell's motion to seal testimony
in a lawsuit issued by Chris Arm-
strong, former Michigan Student
Assembly president, was denied
last week.
Federal Judge Arthur Tarnow
issued a four-page order on June
29 denying Shirvell's request for a
protective order that would have
granted Shirvell a sealed deposi-
tion in Armstrong's lawsuit. Arm-
strong - MSA's first openly gay
president - filed a lawsuit against
Shirvell inApril after he claimed in
his blog "Chris Armstrong Watch"
that Armstrong had a "radical
homosexual agenda."
Specifically, the judge's report
said there was "no merit" in
Shirvell's argument, and he was
unable to show cause for con-
cern if the videotaped deposition
remained part of the case.
"Defendant's failure to iden-
tify 'specific facts' showing 'clearly
defined and serious injury' that
would result from the discovery
sought prevents the Court from
exercising its discretion in grant-
ing the relief requested," the judge
wrote in his report.

Affirmative action
supporters rejoice
after ban upended
ByANDREW SCHULMAN
Daily StaffReporter
In a 2-1 decision on Friday, the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
declared a Michigan referendum
banning the considerations of
race and gender in college admis-
sions unconstitutional, marking

a victory for advocates of affir-
mative action.
The court said the ban -
which became part of the state's
constitution after a racially
divided vote in November 2006
- "unconstitutionally alters
Michigan's political structure by
impermissibly burdening racial
minorities."
In a press conference on the
steps of the Michigan Union on
Friday, George Washington, an
attorney with the Coalition to
Defend Affirmative Action, Inte-

gration, and Immigration and
Fight for Equality By Any Means
Necessary, joined students and
BAMN representatives to rejoice
over what Washington called "a
tremendous victory" for the civil
rights of students.
Washington, who is also a
plaintiff in the case, said he
was supportive of the decision
to overturn the ban, commonly
'known as Proposal 2, because it
could bridge racial inequalities
by ensuring leadership that fully

At event, 'U' officials
discuss benefits of
film tax incentives
for economic growth
By KATE HUMMER
For the Daily
LANSING - In a presenta-
tion on Wednesday at the Capitol
Building in Lansing, members of
the University community dis-
cussed the drawbacks to ending
Michigan's film incentive pro-
gram and considered ways to
amend it for the future.
Jim Burnstein - Hollywood
screenwriter, University lec-
turer in Screen Arts & Cultures,
and vice chair of the Michigan
Film Office Advisory Council -
presented his proposal "Amend,
Don't End" at the event, a plan
to amend Michigan film incen-
tive tax by reducing Michigan's
incentive rebate from 42 percent
to 32 percent.

Additionally, Burnstein's plan
calls to offer additional incen-
tives to film companies that do
post-production work in Michi-
gan, and advocates for a collabor-
ative effort with Pure Michigan
that includes placing their logos
in the credits of films made in the
state as part of an effort to pro-
mote tourism.
The film incentives bill,
passed in 2008, provided a 42
percent rebate to production-
related expenses incurred in the
state. According to Burnstein, it
accomplished three goals: to cre-
ate jobs, build infrastructure and
reverse the "brain drain" - the
loss of Michigan's young talent to
more "successful" states.
Burnstein noted that at least
4,000 full-time, lucrative jobs
have been created by the film
industry in Michigan since 2008,
adding that part of the upswing
can be attributed to the opening
of Motown Motion Picture Stu-
dios in Pontiac in 2009, which
was constructed by Raleigh Stu-
dios, one of the biggest motion

picture facilities in the world.
There has been an increase
in Michigan students moving
to Detroit after graduating to
pursue film careers in the state,
Burnstein said.
He also discussed the "multi-
plier effect" perpetuated by the
film industry, urging the audi-
ence to consider jobs created by
large film casts and crews look-
ing to utilize Michigan hotels, eat
at Michigan restaurants and rent
cars from Michigan businesses.
He added that for every incentive
dollar spent, there is a six-dollar
positive impact on the state's
economy.
Burnstein said he doesn't
believe Republican Gov. Rick
Snyder or the Michigan Treasury
Department took into account
the positive impact of film incen-
tives when they rallied to support
the new, 2011 film incentive bill
- which places a $25 million per
year cap on rebates given to film
companies that shoot in Michi-
gan.
Now that the Michigan film

incentive is at risk of being
reduced, Burnstein said not only
could the state potentially lose
University graduates studying
film to other parts of the coun-
try as they search for careers,
but also high caliber students in
other fields that may be related
to film, exacerbating the brain
drain.
Robert Rayher, University
lecturer in Screen Arts & Cul-
tures, ended the presentation
by discussing an upper-level
Screen Arts course that collabo-
rates with Michigan's top three
research universities - the Uni-
versity of Michigan, Michigan
State University, and Wayne State
University - to bring together
the top film students from each
school to create a professional,
20-minute film.
Rayher said he credits the
course with significantly help-
ing to keep the film industry in
Michigan.
"(We're) keeping the hope
alive via this program," Rayher
said.

@burger closes after 11 months
at East Liberty Street location

Restaurant says the
closure is partly
due to increased
competition
By SARAH ALSADEN
Daily News Editor
After 11 months at its East Lib-
erty Street location, the restau-
rant @burger closed its doors for
the final time last weekend.
The restaurant, which was
a new venture for Big Boy Res-
taurants, opened last summer in
the McKinley Towne Centre -
which also houses retailers like
FedEx, Tomukun Noodle Bar
and Lab Cafe. According to David
Crawford, senior vice president
of marketing for Big Boy Restau-
rants, increased competition as
well changes in the summer pop-
ulation of Ann Arbor were major
influences in the company's clo-
sure.
Crawford said that while there
were various reasons the busi-
ness closed, the most prominent
was that it was difficult to devote
the attention necessary to @
burger with such a large number
of Big Boy Restaurants to attend
to.
"I think a big (reason) is that
we have 140 Big Boys, and so our
focus is really tight now on the
Big Boy chain," Crawford said.
"There were some lessons we
got out of the chain, but again,
our focus remains Big Boy so we
wanted to make sure that was
front and center."
Crawford added another sig-
nificant reason for the decision
to close the business involved
decreased sales and increased
competition from other restau-
rants.
"The chain did increase some
increased competition that we
didn't see when we first opened
- this was the Five Guys that
i was built on State (Street) in our

"burger proximity" if you will -
within half a block," Crawford
said.
Additionally, Crawford said
the significant decline in the stu-
dent population at the end of the
winter semester and the begin-
ning of spring semester also con-
tributed heavily to a decline in
sales, which prompted the deci-
sion.
"I didn't expect such a notice-
able drop off from students when
the students left for the summer,"
Crawford said.
Crawford added that sales had
been significantly higher dur-
ing the fall semester, before Five
Guys Burgers and Fries opened
on State Street.
"We had probably done double
the sales volume ... during the
football season and then when
winter came we had a noticeable
drop-off, just because I think
people don't get out and walk as
much," Crawford said.
Though the company intends
to use some of the menu items
from the @burger restaurant,
there are no plans to open a
similar restaurant in the future,
Crawford said.
"There is some great burger
research that we did for that
chain that we'll start to utilize in
our Big Boy business," he said.
However, while the @burger
brand has been retired indefi-
nitely, Crawford said there is still
possibility for the opening of a
Big Boy restaurant in Ann Arbor.
"I love Ann Arbor, in terms
of community and the lower
unemployment rate and just the
general culture of the city is just
perfectly suited for us," he said.
Thomas Gritter, vice presi-
dent and managing director of
commercial real estate at the
McKinley Towne Centre, echoed
Crawford's sentiment that com-
petition from neighboring res-
taurants played a major role in @
burger's demise.
Gritter also said he believed
one of the reasons that contribut-

ed to the decision to close @burg-
er was the novelty of the concept
for the company.
"I think they saw the next gen-
eration of burger joints and want-
ed to see if that was a brand they
could do well with," Gritter said.
"(We) gave them a shot, and we
believed in them and it just didn't
work."
Gritter explained there has
already been interest in leasing
the location where @burger was
located due to the equity in dis-
tance from both Downtown Ann
Arbor and Central Campus.
"We've had a lot of interest
already, calls have been off the
hook already since (the closing)
with interest for that spot," Grit-
ter said. "There have been some
national restaurants that have
been interested."
While Gritter said it's hard to
gauge whether the next leaser
will be successful, he has high
hopes for the location.
"It's a very in-demand spot,"
Gritter said. "Liberty continues
to be very dedicated and hot retail
corridor, so I think we'll be able to
pick from what we wantto put in."
David Gordon, district manag-
er at Five Guys Burgers and Fries
said he didn't know that @burger
had closed but had noticed an
increase in sales in the past few
weeks, which he said can likely,
be attributed to the an influx of
people visiting Ann Arbor due to
freshman orientation or the time
of year itself.
Gordon said having other
burger joints in the area is an
issue that doesn't concern his
company, but is rather something
they embrace.
"As far as we're concerned,
the competition in the area - we
welcome it, we enjoy the fact that
there's other stores in the area
that grill burgers as well," Gor-
don said. "Other stores do their
spin on what burgers are sup-
posed to be and we do ours and
hopefully in the end we all get to
make money out of it."

Reversing iscrimination
The repeal of Proposition 2 should be upheld
At a time when certain states are passing uncompromising
anti-immigration laws and others are striving their best
to effectively make abortion illegal, it's reassuring that
Michigan is leaning toward a civil rights victory. Last Friday, the
6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-to-1 to overturn the
Orwellian Michigan Civil Rights Initiative (commonly known as
Proposal 2), ruling that the ban on considerations of race and
gender in public-university admissions and government hiring.is
unconstitutional. This ruling was the first step to restoring affir-
mative action in Michigan. For the sake of equality and diversity,
it must be upheld in the likely future appeal process.

Ladies and gents, it's not just
Kid Cudi that's on the "Pursuit of
Happiness."
Thomas Jefferson was too.
Along with John Adams, Benjamin
Franklin and 53 other men work-
ing to gain freedom from King
George III in July of 1776. The
Declaration of Independence said
it with a bit more Congressional
style than Cudi, but the same ulti-
mate desires are there: "We hold
these truths to be self-evident, that
all men are created equal, that they
are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable Rights, that
among these are Life, Liberty and
the pursuit of Happiness."
The last few decades have seen
a diminishing of such pursuits in
the name of safety, moderation,
deferred gratification and political
correctness; our recklessly behav-
ing athletes and celebrities were
often chastised, while the Lance
Armstrong-type role models were
rewarded. Today, it seems the
reins might be loosening as Kid
Cudi and his contemporaries are
happily wielding their bad boy
behaviors.
I admit, I was an attendant of
the 2011 Cud Life Tour. And fur-
thermore, I definitely enjoyed
swaying with the crowd, but I also
found myself wowed at the rapidly
changing course of society - and
not necessarily the good kind of
"wow."
Standing on the linoleum floor
of San Diego's Valley View Casino
Center in a confluence of mixed
demographics, I became increas-
ingly aware of our generation. The
house thundered Cudi with full
throttle sing-along and palms as
he sang, "Pretty green bud all in
my blunt / Oh, I need it ... Oh, do
you wanna smoke?"
As Cudi performed "Marijuana"
live, the green lights were flash-
ing in our retinas. Images of 1970s
Haight-Asbury in combination
with a marijuana plant flashing
repeatedly upon the screen, only
intensified the energy of the audi-
ence. It seemed possible that in
the year 2068, American Culture
majors, along with studying hip-
pies, beatniks and punks, could be
reading "21st Century: The His-
tory of the Cudians."
I question if in the light of all
this glorious freedom, by stray-
ing from moderation, we might
risk losing some clarity and direc-

tion. Overindulgence comes to the
forefront during many American
holidays - tryptophan on Thanks-
giving, green bagels and beer on St.
P iricks Day - but annually on the
Fourth of July, hot with indepen-
dence, many celebrate the freedom
to pursue happiness by saturating
themselves in family, alcohol, UVB
rays and barbequed anything.
Oscar Wilde opined on the sub-
ject: "Moderation is a fatal thing.
Nothing succeeds like excess." If
you're a human who enjoys life,

on souse occasion to ease your sat-
urated mind of guilt. More com-
mon is runningto hot vinyasa yoga
class to extinguish your doubled-
over toxins once the fireworks no
longer linger in the sky.
A current of moderation runs
through Americans' veins, or at
least through the minds of their
better selves, but when freedom
is the American dream (along
with rags to riches and an infin-
ity pool on the side), its easy to
live in excess. Perhaps our genera-
tion finds its niche in pushing the
boundaries that restrain us, allow-
ing desire to flourish through to
the extremes.
My enthusiasm for loosened
reins and unbridled freedoms is
unfortunately tempered by the
buzz created from Kid Cudi's popu-
lar lyric, "I'll be up up and away /
cuz they gon' judge me anyway
so whatever." This isn't the most
respectable or well-rooted mental-
ity to advertise; "whatever" is too
easy. Pushing a different and more
respectable ideology was Jack Ker-
ouac with, "If moderation is a fault,
then indifference is a crime."
Overindulgence isn't new, our
Google generation is just overin-
dulging in a fusion of avenues that
frighten the soul: marijuana and
Twitter. We're somehow both lazy
and overexcited at the same time,
teetering on an edge that has yet to
be explored.
But only time will tell whether
Cudi's coaxing will speak louder
than declarations of D.A.R.E. If
moderation truly is a fault, I hope
you chose to indulge in your pas-
sions on this Fourth, whether that
was reading by a river or chugging
Four Loko. To an always-changing
world! To Jefferson!

Affirmative action is one of the
means to make our society more
equal, and attempts to block
it are attempts to maintain an
unacceptable status quo. Minori-
ties continue to suffer from
huge social and institutional
disadvantages due to historical
and contemporary prejudices.
A disproportionate amount of
minority students receive subop-
timal educations in underfunded
school systems. Income equality
among races is still a dream.
These problems require more
than one solution, and revers-
ing Proposal 2 won't solve all of
them. But while politicians fail to
address other problems that lead
to differences in socioeconomic
status, it will be devastating to
already disenfranchised racial
groups if Michigan institutions
are forbidden from mitigating the
societal factors that limit the suc-
cess of minorities.

Yet when it comes to affirma-
tive action, it's not just equal-
ity that matters. "Diversity" has
become a buzzword these days,
but it doesn't lessen the impor-
tance of interacting with people
of different backgrounds, beliefs
and experiences. Diversity is part
of what makes our experience
at the University so rewarding.
Being around people who are
different from ourselves allows
us to critically evaluate our own
opinions and beliefs and compare
them to others who are different.
In order to provide a meaningful
education, and to stimulate the
intellects and the values of under-
graduate students, an admissions
system needs to be based on more
than just SAT scores.
It's not just the University that
believes this - the United States
Supreme Court does too. In Grut-
ter v. Bollinger in 2003, the Court
upheld the admissions policy of

the University of Michigan Law
School, which allowed for the con-
sideration of race in combination
with academic and extracurricular
achievements. The majority rul-
ing stated that the United States
Constitution "does not prohibit
the law school's narrowly tailored
use of race in admissions decisions
to further a compelling interest in
obtaining the educational benefits
that flow from a diverse student
body." Proposal 2 put this ruling on
hold, but it may not last much lon-
ger. It potentially has to survive a
likely appeal in the 6th U.S. Circuit
Court in which all sixteen judges
vote (instead of just three) before
reaching the Supreme Court. Legal
experts say the case could go either
way in each court. In the interest of
racial equality and diversity in the
face of unchanging socioeconomic
status, each court should uphold
the reversal of the Michigan Civil
Rights Initiative.

Machiavellian malls

Newt Loken, truly the father of
Michigan men's gymnastics, was
the kind of person you thought
would live forever. So when he
died last Tuesday, June 28, a little
part of me died too.
But Newt was never one to stay
sad for long, and he was very clear
that any memorial for him was to be
a celebration. And there were many
things about Newt to celebrate.
His presence always lit up the
gym. I loved Mondays during the
season, when Newt would come by
to tell all the gymnasts how much
he'd enjoyed the competition on
Saturday. The boys would just
glow as Newt complimented them.
The award for best individual
performance at each home meet
is named for Newt. Until this past
season, Newt was always there to
present the certificate at the end
of the competition. For Wolver-
ines, winning a Newt Loken ranks
near the top in career highlights.
For over 60 years, Newt didn't
miss a home meet. He'd come into
Cliff Keen Arena with little fan-
fare, accompanied by Bob Wil-
loughby, a member of that original
1948 team. Despite the incognito
entrance, there would be a line
of people - gymnasts, gymnas-
tics alumni, parents, opposing
coaches, judges and dedicated
fans - waiting to say hi and have a
minute with the legendary coach.
And Newt didn't forget peo-
ple. Mention any former team-
mate and he'd have a story to tell
about that guy. Then he'd tell you
everything you could ever want
to know about his family. I loved
listening to those stories. I could
sit transfixed for hours, at the gym
and later in the quiet of the Daily
library, as Newt spun his tales.

He had a gift for charming peo-
ple, making just the right gesture.
When my beloved dog Angel died,
the next day Newt left a bouquet
of flowers at the Daily for me. In
every e-mail exchange we had
after I graduated from Michigan,
he'd ask about both of my parents
- and never forget good wishes to
my new dog, Juno.
I did tons of interviews with
people about Newt, either for a
feature article or for his biography.
No one could ever keep a smile off
their face when they spoke of him.
He was more than a coach - he
was a second father and a trea-
sured friend to so many people.
Former gymnast Jim Hayslett
attributed nearly every good thing
in his life to Newt's influence,
including his becoming a dentist.
Nobody beat Newt when it came
to communication. If you were a
part of Michigan men's gymnas-
tics Newt was in touch with you.
Newt wasn't a person who
faded from people's lives, and
I think that's what we'll be sad
about. We can't be sad for Newt -
he had such a long, full, wonderful
life. But now those chatty e-mails
and letters will stop. And we'll
only have our warm memories of
this amazing man.
Newt was known for his wise
and witty sayings - he even made
them into a little book for his
grandchildren. And one in par-
ticular encapsulates him:
"Those who bring sunshine to
others cannot keep it from them-
selves."
No one brought more sunshine
to the world than Newt.

I went home the other day and
did some casual shopping with
my mom
at Twelve
Oaks Mall in
Novi. I don't
know why'
specifying
the location
is necessary;
all malls
are essen- NICK
tially the BRINGARDNER
same. Their
purpose is
to sell, no matter what the prod-
uct is. After hundreds of years of
studying the psychology of retail
salesmanship, it seemsretail stores
have found effective, albeit brash,
ways to sell products. It's all about
the presentation.
I walked into Banana Republic
to browse and, just as Mom expert-
ly taught me, went straight to the
clearance rack, avoiding all the
pretty displays of new arrivals (the
full price stuff) arranged in order
to pique my interest. But the cun-
ning of retail pervaded the entire
store; even the fitting room is
deceiving. Iwent in to try on a shirt
and found I liked the wayI looked.
The lighting from the front and
not overhead illuminated my eyes
like a model in a photo shoot. It
would appear that was intentional,
as manipulating the fitting room
lighting is an important opportu-
nity for retail stores to close a sale.
And if it's flattering enough, a per-
son might end up buying the item
in question. So I tried on the shirt
and batted my eyes at my narcissis-
tic reflection, never realizing that
Banana Republic had just implant-

ed the desire to buy the t-shirt into
my feeble mind.
The concept of retailsales seems
to be based almost solely on illu-
sion. When trying on clothes, or
even after I have purchased them
and taken them home, the ques-
tion I always have is this: Why
can't a shirt on me look the way it
looked on the damn mannequin?
Real human beings can't feasibly
pin up a garment in the back to get
the desired fitted look - at least not
without looking like a jackass. And
what about those models present-
ing the clothes in those pictures
above the shelves? There's no way
I'mgoingto looklike that. Associa-
tion with those faces and bodies is
what attracts the buyer. It makes
themthink theycanlookthatgood.
Ostensibly, the purpose of adver-
tising is to show the clothes being
worn; their style, function and
even the lifestyle associated with
the clothes. But it's just illusion.
Mannequin displays and model
pictures aren't always realistic. In
the end, people end up comparing
themselves to these images, and
that can lead to unhealthy choices.
After going to a few shops and
suffering through places like Pot-
tery Barn and Sephora, Mom and
I headed out. I thought we were
home free, but one more obstacle
stood between us and the exit. The
makeup and perfume section was a
dizzying labyrinth of bright lights,
colorful displays and borderline
creepy counter attendants with
smiles plastered onto their overly
painted faces. Immediately my
mind turned to cartoon silliness.
There is a parody of the perfume
section in an episode of Sponge-

bob Squarepants - work with me
here - that is hilarious and almost
identical to reality. Spongebob
and Patrick try to escape from the
Flying Dutchman's ship through
the perfume section. There is a
sequence of hands appearing out
of nowhere offering samples, slow
motion puffs and the two charac-
ters gagging and choking. A gas
mask would have been useful for
passing through that section. I
Retail sales are

wonder, how can that combination
of smells be at all enticing? And
the glitz and glamour and special
attention of the makeup counter
disappear once you leave. When
women get home with the makeup,
they usually revert back to a more
sensible look because they can't
recreate what they saw at the mall.
On my way out, I saw possibly
the most heinous item in the entire
mall - bedazzled Uggs. What is
this world coming to? Everything
inside me was screaming in pro-
test of the shoes, but I couldn't
look away. "They're just so shiny,"
I repeated as I brought them to the
register. Only after I came home
did I realize that I didn't actually
want them.

'U' hires new School of Natural Resources dean

Duke faculty
member to return to
Michigan with aims
to improve program
By AUSTIN WORDELL
Daily Staff Reporter
Marie Lynn Miranda, one the
nation's top children's environ-
mental health researchers, is
making a homecoming of sorts.
The Detroit native will be the
new dean of the School of Natu-
ral Resources and Environ-
ment starting next year, pending
approval from the University's
Board of Regents.
In a June 24 University press
release, University President
PROPOSAL
From Page 1
represents the entire population.
"I think it's just the recogni-
tion of reality that an increasing
share, particularly in states like
California, is going to be Latino
and black," Washington said. "And
to try to run a country by excluding
those students (from universities)
... is wrong and inviting a catastro-
phe."
In his address at the Union,
Washington noted that Proposal 2
passed with nine of every ten black
votes and only two-thirds of white
votes, adding that the obstacles to
racial equality in education begin
with discrepancies in secondary
school opportunities and negative
perceptions of affirmative action.
Kellie Lewis, BAMN organizer,
said she is pleased about the deci-
sion and the opportunities for
minority students that may come
with the court's decision.
"I'm really excited," Lewis said.
"I definitely think it's going to
make opportunities for black and
Latino students a lot more equal to
be able to attend college."
She added that in addition to
helping to create diversity, the
decision will also increase inclu-
siveness across campus.
"It definitely gives students
opportunities to be who they are,"
she said. "When you are around a
diverse or integrated crowd it defi-
nitely feels like you are represent-

Mary Sue Coleman said Miranda
is a strong choice for dean of the
SNRE based on her former suc-
cess as both a researcher and an
administer at Duke University.
"Dr. Miranda's scientific exper-
tise and leadership skills made
her a clear choice for guiding the
School of Natural Resources and
Environment," Coleman said in
the release. "She will pay a criti-
cal role in advancing the univer-
sity's commitment to devolving
approaches and solutions for a
more sustainable world."
Miranda will be leaving her
current position at Duke Uni-
versity as faculty member in the
Nicholas School of the Environ-
ment and the Department of
Pediatrics. At Duke, Miranda also
served as the founding director
of the Children's Environmental

Health Initiative, which works
with a number of organizations -
including the U.S Environmental
Protection Agency - to address
environmental health issues that
afflict children.
Miranda said the key to help-
ing alleviate the problems of the
nation's children is through col-
laboration between researchers,
local communities and govern-
ment officials.
"Children, especially those
from disadvantaged communi-
ties face a multitude of stressors
from poverty to crime to environ-
mental exposures," she said. "For
each child to reach his or her full
potential, we need to create policy
changes that address all of these
many factors."
Miranda said she is excited to

a place she visited frequently with
her family while growing up in
Detroit and during high school for
various programs.
"I grew up admiring the Uni-
versity of Michigan, and spent
time on the campus as part of
high school summer programs,"
Miranda said. "I have long felt
an affection and attachment to
the University of Michigan, and
returning home to the state of
Michigan is especially appealing
to our family."
Miranda added she is proud to
join the faculty, staff and students
in the SNRE due to their collec-
tive mission to improve methods
of protecting the Earth's natural
resources.
As dean of the School of Natu-
ral Resources and Environment,

ward to using SNRE's interdis-
ciplinary nature to continue to
achieve the school's initiatives.
"I am very excited about join-
ing the SNRE community, whose
students, faculty, and staff are
truly impressive," Miranda said.
"I particularly look forward to the
opportunity to further the many
achievements of SNRE, as well
as to build bridges with the other
schools at Michigan."
Miranda added that she is plan-
ning to gather concerns from indi-
viduals and educators within the
SNRE in order to make improve-
ments to the school.
"I plan to spend the initial
months of my deanship listening
to the many SNRE constituencies
as we begin a. strategic planning
process for this next phase in the
school's history," Miranda said.

work at the University since it was Miranda said she is looking for-

ed there, like you can have a place
there."
Taqee Vernon, Business junior
and spokesperson for the Black
Student Union, said he did not
attend the event but is pleased by
the news. However, he added he is
still dismayed by continuing racial
and socioeconomic inequalities.
"Being ... an African American
and a Detroiter, I kind of have a
very clear position in which I get to
see a socioeconomic, on one part,
and then racial, on another part,
injustice that still exists and per-
sists in America," Vernon said. "So
I feel like the things that affirma-
tive action allowed to counter that
injustice was a very positive step
for the United States."
Among the advantages of affir-
mative action, Vernon said, is its
ability to encourage dialogue about
racial injustices and the benefits of
diversity.
"It allows people to look at injus-
tices and inequalities, to openly
recognize that they do exist, and
to at least seek to correct those dis-
crepancies," he said. "The diversity
of Michigan allowed me to see a
different perspective ... and I can
only hope I see that improve with
(the decision)."
For the American Civil Liber-
ties Union of Michigan, instilling
diversity within the state's public
universities was one of the major
benefits of affirmative action and
the most severe casualties of Pro-
posal 2. According to an ACLU
press rglease, the number of Afri-

can American, Hispanic and Native
Americans in the University's
freshman class has dropped 11.4
percent since 2006 - a trend the
ACLU hopes will be reversed by the
court's decision Friday.
"(Friday's) ruling has kept the
door open for thousands of academ-
ically qualified students of color to
continue to pursue the American
dream through our state's colleges
and universities," Kary L. Moss,
executive director of the ACLU of
Michigan, said in the statement.
In a July 1 statement, Univer-
sity spokeswoman Kelly Cunning-
ham said it is too soon to predict
what implications the decision may
have on University admissions, but
added that the University will con-
tinue to monitor the situation in the
likely scenario of an appeal.
"The University is reviewing the
possible implications of the court's
decision, and recognizes that there
may be further legal steps as well,"
Cunningham said.
Michigan Attorney General Bill
Schuette confirmed Cunningham's
speculation, and said in a statement
that he would appeal the decision
with the hope of restoring merit-
based admissions.
"(Proposal 2) embodies the fun-
damental premise of what Amer-
ica is all about: equal opportunity
under the law," Schuette said in the
statement. "Entrance to our great
universities must be based upon
merit, and I will continue the fight
for equality, fairness and rule of
law"

SHIRVELL
From Page 1
Shirvell wrote in a July 2
statement to The Michigan Daily
that he requested his testimony
be sealed because he feared for
his personal safety.
"I asked Judge Tarnow to
seal my upcoming deposition
because Chris Armstrong, his
counsel Deborah Gordon, and
Armstrong's associates and
political supporters intend to
publicly disseminate the testi-
mony elicited during my deposi-
tion in order to irreparably harm
me, thereby using my deposition
for purposes not directly related
to the lawsuit," Shirvell wrote.
Shirvell wrote he has received
several threats and intimidat-
ing messages from supporters
of Armstrong over the past ten
months and is "thoroughly dis-
appointed" the judge did not
award his motion, adding that
Armstrong and his associates
did not accommodate his best
interests.
"In the past, Armstrong has
repeatedly sought media atten-
tion concerning this case in
order to promote his political
agenda, and Armstrong and
his allies have sought to finan-
cially benefit from it - all at my
expense," Shirvell wrote.
Shirvell added that the rul-
ing has challenged his ability to
find employment after he was

fired last November due to the
incident.
"Armstrong and his associ-
ates have also evinced a willing-
ness to make my life a living hell
by continuing to harass me and
making it impossible for me to
earn a living," he wrote.
Deborah Gordon, Arm-
strong's attorney, said it is
uncommon to seal depositions
except in extreme cases. She
added that while it is unclear
why Shirvell wanted to seal the
deposition, it appears he does
not want anyone to hear his tes-
timony.
"I think a clear point of his
papers is that he doesn't want
anyone to see what he says in his
deposition ... which I don't know
why, since he says he's telling
the truth," Gordon said. "Why
wouldn't you want someone to
hear the truth?"
Gordon also refuted Shirvell's
claims that she and Armstrong
intend to harm Shirvell's repu-
tation with the deposition, add-
ing that Shirvell's desire to seal
the deposition appears to indi-
cate that something in it could
potentially prove to cause him
"embarrassment."
"It's an odd statement for him
to make," Gordon said. "He's
going to be answering ques-
tions under oath, (and) he has to
answer honestly - he apparent-
ly feels that his honest answers
to questions are going to harm
his reputation."

'Moon' misses mark

Cinema dilluted

Effects can't save
third installment
of 'Transformers'
By DAVID TAO
Daily Flm Editor
The latest entry in the "Trans-
formers" franchise can be viewed
in a variety of ways. It's revo-
lutionary. It's
trendsetting.
It's visionary.
It's supremely Trsform-
in tune with the
current cultural ers Dark of

the interests of
journalistic eth-
ics, there are a
few redeeming qualities about
"Transformers: Dark of the Moon"
that should be mentioned. From a
purely technical standpoint, it's
genius. The visual effects are (ini-
tially) stunning and the 3-D is the
best since "Avatar." Since 3-D cam-
eras are heavier than normal cam-
eras, director Michael Bay ("Pearl
Harbor") couldn't rely on the
shaky-cam thing he usually does.
And Megan Fox's replacement,
newcomer and Victoria's Secret
model Rosie Huntington-White-
ley, is absolutely gorgeous. Fox was
shamelessly sexualized for Bay's
amusement. Huntington-Whitely
is shamelessly sexualized, but she

COURTESY OF PARAMOUNT

can also sort of deliver her lines in
a (somewhat) realistic fashion.
To a certain extent, these things
all set "Dark of the Moon" a small
step above its predecessor, the uni-
versally abhorred "Revenge of the
Fallen," mainly because you can
watch without developing nausea.
But the film also inherits most of
the second installment's problems:
shamelessly explicit product place-
ment, government computers, vid-
eoconferencing and transforming
cars. There are endless plugs for
the military, shameless war movie
cliches, and of course, toilet humor
and the casual racism.
That doesn't even touch on the
disjointed, paper-thin plot. Pro-
tagonist Sam Witwicky (an incred-
ibly bitchy Shia LaBeouf, "Wall
Street: Money Never Sleeps"), is
unhappily working the mail room.
Meanwhile, Optimus Prime and
the other Autobots, who stand for
freedom and justice, find some sort
of sci-fi MacGuffin that can some-
how save their old planet, Cyber-

tron. The Decepticons - the evil
enemy robots from the last two
movies - naturally start shooting
each other. Witwicky manages to
involve himself because he's a big
boy now and he deserves to do big
boy things with the other big boys
- LaBeouf, full of self-righteous
angst, says words to this effect
throughout the movie.
Just as Swiss cheese needs
a certain number of holes to be
considered Swiss and a Michael
Bay-directed film needs a certain
number of holes to be considered
authentic, "Dark of the Moon,"
with its multitude of unnecessary
scenes and unresolved character
arcs, doesn't disappoint. As in most
of Bay's films, the script is an after-
thought, simply an excuse to light
the entire Chicago skyline on fire.
The performances are painful
to watch, too. Veterans like John
Turturro ("Do The Right Thing")
and John Malkovich ("Burn After
Reading") remind us through their
See'MOON', Page 9

By MATTHEW KANE
For the Daily
The first film I remember see-
ing is "Jurassic Park" on opening
weekend during the summer of
1993, and it remains one of my most
cherished memories. From the
back seat of an early '90s Honda
parked at a drive-in theater on a
rainy night, I watched a Tyran-
nosaurus smash through cars
much sturdier than my own. The
film was set to a backdrop of trees
swaying in the wind - or were they
swaying from a massive prehistoric
lizard pushing its way through the
suburban sprawl of Dayton, Ohio?
In what may have been the birth of
my love for film, the horror of the
scene took a backseat to the maj-
esty of the moment, the serenity of
becoming lost in the monumental
potential of movies.
Skip ahead 18 years and I could
watch "Jurassic Park" at any time,
in any place. I could - and often
do - fire up my video iPod to watch
"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" in
an I-94 traffic jam. I've watched
"Machete" at the gym, "Drag Me
to Hell" in retail backrooms, and
"Up" while walking to German
class.
And each time, I feel a little
guilty for it - this isn't how movies
are meant to be seen.
I was eager to adopt the same
iPod mentality for film that I have
for music. It's such a nice idea to
have the "Lord of the Rings" tril-
ogy around at all times, the same
way it's nice to have every song by
your favorite band at your disposal
for instant gratification. But film
doesn't translate. A song can give

your day a soundtrack, especially
as we're becoming more "on-the-
go" daily. But films? They can't
make the transition from the silver
screen to your iPod for jogging, for
background noise, or for class-to-
class travel. They demand your
attention visually, audibly and nar-
ratively.
I won't knock Netflix - the most
direct, appropriate equivalent of
iTunes to film and television -
but torrenting websites have also
devalued cinema's shimmer to the
status of cold productup for instant
evaluation. I know, Hollywood
makes products, Hollywood sells
us products, everyone goes about
living. But when a film is truly done
well, like J.J. Abrams's "Super 8,"
which delivers a potent rush of cin-
ematic awe, how do you expect to
experience the same effect on a tiny
laptop screen with tinny audio?
The huge screen, the crisp projec-
tion and the room illuminated only
by dim exit signsis all necessaryfor
appreciating film as an event over a
file you can swipe online.

Hello iPods, 3-D.
Goodbye film.

The inauthentic direction cin-
ema is heading is only perpetuated
by Hollywood's gimmicks. The 3-D
boom of the post-"Avatar" cinema
has been an attempt to cram the
idea of "the event film" down the
throats of moviegoers. It's been
successful thus far, giving both a
new reason to buy a ticket at the
theaters and making an excuse
to charge more for it. Some of the
success has been alarming, with
such popularity that deliciously
stupid films like "Piranha 3D" are
getting not only sequels, but rip-
offs in "Shark Night 3D" and "Bait
3D," both horrifying omens of the 4
holographic shark from "Jaws
19" in "Back to the Future: Part
Two." 3-D was supposed to be the
next generation in filmmaking,
and while 3-D films keep on com-
ing, it's often nothing more than
a cheap gimmick that ends up not 4
being so cheap for audiences. The
same thing goes for D-BOX seat-
ing, which provides motion simu-
lation for action films. I personally
prefer it to 3-D cinema, as one can

'Finally' not worth hype The end of the Potter era

s V 1 I Rv PROMA KH0191,A

By DAVID TAO
Daily Film Editor
Detroit's own Big Sean was once
Kanye West's protegd and one of
the hottest MC's
on the so-called
freshman list. He
was a guy who Big Sean
could take super-
ficial rhymes and Finally Famous
turn them into
hits, a creative G.O.OD. Music
rapper who could
do lowbrow and
highbrow equally well. With tic
backing of G.O.O.D. Music, he was
going to bring good hip hop back to
the airwaves.
Well now, Sean's debut, Finally
Famous, is in stores and, lo and
behold, it's far from the classic
many were expecting. Instead of
arrogant, witty lyrics set over revo-
lutionary, envelope-pushing beats a
lalast year's collaboration, G.O.O.D.
Fridays, most of the album is for-
mulaically geared towards chart
success, or recycled material from
past mixtapes. None of it is excit-
ing. Even less of it is original.
From the album's intro track, we
can tell we're off to a bad start, as
Sean spits a few bars about being,
well, finally famous, over a repack-
aged version of an old mixtape beat.
It's something we'll hear over and
over again as the album grinds on,
whether he's "that Detroit player

At page 699 of"Harry Potter and
the Deathly Hallows," I had to put
down the book.
My face was alreadysoaked with
tears, my body convulsing with
hysterical sobs, but on page 699, I
had to drop everything and run to
the bathroom because I was sure I
was going to be sick.
As it happens, I wasn't, lout not
for lack of impulse. Thankfully,
I had only eaten a single samosa
in the past 24 hours, so there was
nthi" , to c"ve 'wes ts' nin"nnl
upheaval hit (pun intended).
Page 699 falls under chapter 34,
"The Forest Again," and it remains
to this day one of the most heart-
breaking episodes of literature I
have ever read. It is when Harry
resigns himself to death and sum-
mons the spirits of his parents and
guardians to walk with him to the
close. It is when his mother tells
him he has been brave and that
they will stay with him "until the
very end."
In her dedication of the book,
J.K. Rowling thanks us, the read-
ers, for doing the same.
I've been with Harry since I was
eight years old. That's well over
half my life, and for all that time,
there has always been something
to look forward to in the world of
Potter. Even since the lastbook and
the emptyfeelingofknowingitwas
the end, there was always this last
movie. It was a pleasant, unreach-
able future, distant enough that I
didn't need to worry about losing
Harry forever.
But that day has come.
I feel like I've already let go
of Harry so many times. When I
finally finished that last book (and
for the two days that followed,
when I was too ill to go into work)
and every time I've read it since, my
heart aches for him and for all the
characters that I've come to love in
the past 12 years. And I know I'm
not alone: We are the "Harry Pot-
ter" generation, the grade-school-
erswho arestartingtoheadoutinto
the real world with the comfort of
Hogwarts tucked away inside our
minds.Whether you lovedhated or
just never bothered with it, "Harry
Potter" is part of your adolescence
and your adulthood. These books
and movies have been our constant
through the most formative years
of our lives.
Maybe it's truer for me than

most. For as long as I can remem-
her, I've been The Harry Potter
Girl, a label I wear proudly because
it's just that true. I've got too many
"Harry Potter" t-shirts and too
much wall space devoted to the
boy wizard, but I never imposed
my obsession upon anyone. It was
always more important tno remind
myself how much I love Jo's books
and count myself lucky for what
they've done for me.
When the final film releases, I
will be at The Wizarding World of
Harry Potter in Orlando, Fla. for
LeakyCon, my sixth Potter con-
'"n io"in I'll he sitting inna5 5:5
theater hours before midnight
with other conference attendees -
known to me as the Harry Potter
fandom, my second family.
I'm pretty sure we'll all be crying
before the opening titles, and I'm
truly terrified for the visualization
of chapter 34. But after 12 years,
though, that's not what matters.
Whatever happens on screen will
pale in comparison to our reaction
as fans. I'll be a mess again: eye-
liner everywhere and sobs louder
than the film audio, but I won't be
alone.
Hogwarts letter?
Still waiting ...
In the end, the true worth of
Harry Potter resides in the days
that follow - they will be filled
with concerts, keynotes, discus-
sions, parties, sleepless nights, new r
friends made in the lobby and of
course, a ball to send everyone off
in style. What I'll take away is the
experience of being with hundreds
of people to whom I. don't have to
justify being The Harry Potter Girl,
because they've all been there.
In the words of Harry and the
Potters, "No, it won't be over 'til it's
over / Yes, it's we who will decide
/ That it won't be over / Unless we
have all died." "Harry Potter" isn't
ending with this movie, just as it
didn't end with the last book. The
magic Jo created is in everything
I do and in all those friends I've
made because of this. It's in every
tear, everysmile and everyhugthat
will mark July 15 and the future
beyond it.
It's in all of us, because we stuck
with Harry, until the very end.

in one of Bay's movies is largely
futile. Similarly, nobody's com-
paring LaBeouf to Pacino or De
Niro. What's truly sad is that a vast
majority of moviegoers don't care
about this. If people can't tell, or
don't care, about the difference
between well-scripted masterpiec-
es and cinematic junk food, what
does that say about the future?
Today, there are auteurs, like
Martin Scorsese, Darren Aronof-
sky and David Fincher, who are

dedicated to their art and care
more about an engaging story than
eye-opening explosions. There
are directors like J.J. Abrams and
Christopher Nolan, who routinely
bridge the divide between intel-
lectualism and populist sentiment.
Then, there are guys like Bay, in a
category by themselves, who stick
a billion dollars of special effects
behind a children's toy and call it
filmmaking. And modern audienc-
es eat it up. God help us all.

feel where the extra money is
going. It's a fun gimmick for those
who haven't experienced it, but
entirely inessential.
The event, however, isn't about
a gimmick, and that's where Hol-
lywood is off. There's nothing

more electric than opening night
of a Tarantino or Nolan film. The
first screening of "Inglourious
Basterds" that I attended, prob-
ably the most European block-
buster to hit domestic screens
in years, felt like being elbow to
elbow with slap-happy cinephiles.
"Inception" in theaters evoked
some of the most universal "ooh's"
and "awe's" I've ever heard from

an audience. No 3-D, no D-BOX,
just filmmaking at its finest. Now
that we have access to so much via
the Internet, it's easy to give in to
consumption and instant evalua-
tion. I'm guilty of it, too. At least
give the films you're consuming
a chance to return the favor and
consume you in the world they've
created, the way that a T-rex
might do at an Ohio drive-in.

World Ice Dancing champions reflect on experience ,

After winning World
Championship, duo
looks forward to
returning to 'U'
By MICHELE NAROV
Daily Staff Reporter
After winning the silver
medal in the 2010 Olympic games
in Vancouver, LSA students Meryl
Davis and Charlie White began
the 2011 ice dancing season with
one goal in mind: to leap to the
top of the podium at the World Ice
Dancing Championships in April.
Months later, after countless
grueling training sessions and
one ten-hour flight to Moscow,
they not only achieved their goal,
but also made history as the first
American team to do so. On top of
all of that, they still plan to take
classes at the University in Sep-
tember.
The reality of the win didn't
set in for the pair until they were
interviewed in the "kiss-and-cry"

- a playful term ice dancers use
to describe the area where they
receive their scores after their
names have been announced,
Davis said.
"It was pretty surreal," she
said. "The interviewer asked us
questions that made us think a bit
more, and some questions about
what it meant for us to win. In
that context we were forced to
think about the relevance of what
had happened. It was so excit-
ing."
White said they both felt the
pressure mounting as they waited
to compete after being randomly
selected to skate last in the com-
petition - a daunting task even
for well-seasoned competitors.
- "It is really nerve wracking,"
White said. "It takes sort of a
mental toll because you have to
wait after you warm up on the
ice about 40-50 minutes where
you're just sitting there listen-
ing to everyone finish, wishing
you had somehow drawn another
number."
Adding to the pressure, they
were preceded by their former

competitors and close friends,
Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, who
received the gold medal at the
Olympics in 2010.
Davis said this was not the
first time she and White had skat-
ed last in a competition and their
15 years of experience together
was a substantial advantage.
"We've been doing this for so
long that nerves are just a part
of the game," she said. "We just
try to incorporate nerves, in a
healthy extent, into what we do."
Davis added that when she
and White finally made it onto the
ice at the World Championships,
they did so with the mentality
that they had nothing to lose.
"Charlie and I talked to each
other a little bit right before we
started our program," she said.
"We said all we can do is give it
our best."
White and Davis said their
routine was a tango, which pre-
sented a greater level of difficulty
for them. While it took a substan-
tial amount of time and training
for them to develop the technique
needed for their performance,

they both said the extra effort
paid off.
"We wanted to make sure
it was a good performance to
represent the U.S.," Davis said.
"Despite the fact that Charlie and
I tried not to think about it, every-
one was saying if you win, you'll
be the first American ice dance
team in history to achieve that,
and so we had that in the back of
our minds."
Furthermore, Davis and
White said the win was thrilling
to them not only because of what
it signified for them, but what it
signified for the United States.
"(The victory) holds a special
place for us and a special place for
the country," White said. "We're
very grateful for the opportunity
to do something like that."
Next season, White and Davis
said they plan to continue their
ice dancing careers, and hope to
come up with new routines that
persist in pushingthe boundaries.
"It's going to be interesting to
see just exactly what we can do
to top ourselves," White said. "If
we want to stay at the top, which

definitely we want to do, we're
going to have to work that much
harder."
Despite their rigorous prac-
tice schedules, Davis and White
said they plan on taking class-
es on campus in the fall. Davis
added she loves the days she gets
to spend as a University student.
"It's funny because Charlie
and I have been students at Mich-
igan for several years," she said.
"But I still feel like I can never
get enough. I just love walking
around campus, and walking
through the Diag and the Law
Quad."
Despite their affection for the
University and Ann Arbor, their
fans can rest at ease because the
two have no plans to retire any
time soon, despite their 15 year-
long career. According to White,
he and Davis are too excited about
their work to stop now.
"I wouldn't say it gets easier,"
he said. "There's always sort of
that 'why am I a figure skater, I
could be sitting at home.' But we
love the feeling you get when you
begin to perform."

Hatch on road to recovery after second crash

Recruit battles
for his life after
surviving fatal crash
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
It's like lightening striking the
same place twice - except more
improbable. Twice a plane-crash
victim, twice a survivor.
Just over a week after surviving
a plane crash that took the life of
his father and step-mother, Austin
Hatch has begun his long, painful
road to recovery.
According to a post from the
Hatch family on Austin's Caring-
Bridge page, the 2013 Michigan
basketball recruit has made signifi-
cant strides since arriving at Mun-
son Medical Center in Traverse
City, Mich. on June 24.
"We are encouraged by the
progress Austin has made in this
p first week," the family said in a
statement on CaringBridge.com on
Friday. "He has remained stable,

and notable improvements include
movement to withdraw from pain
and improved breathing function.
Doctors have begun the gradual
process of reducing his medica-
tions.
"As he slowly begins the 'waking
up' process, we ask for your contin-
ued prayers, and are grateful for
the outpouring of love and support
for Austin and the entire extended
Hatch Family."
Hatch, 16, was the lone survivor
when his father, Dr. Stephen Hatch,
was unable to bring his Beechcraft
A36 down to land on the tarmac at
Charlevoix Municipal Airport in
northern Michigan.
A report released by the Nation-
al Transportation Safety Board
pinpointed a faulty attempt at an
instrument approach to the land-
ing, where a GPS approach brings
pilots to 500 feet above the ground.
"Pilots would make an instru-
ment approach for practice or
because they can't see," Indianap-
olis-based flight instructor Pres-
ton Wulfenspein told the Journal
Gazette. "It seems as though he

was either disoriented or confident
enough where he thought he could
descend below the minimums. He
did, but it was not the right thing
to do. It was poor decisionmaking."
According to the report, the
plane broke out of the clouds half-
way down the runway, increased
power and veered around a water
tower on the southwest end of
the airport. The plane stalled and
continued its uncoordinated flight
pattern until it descended into
a residential yard on the north
border of the airport. It was the
second such survival story for Aus-
tin. At the age of eight, he and his
father were the only survivors of a
similar crash that took the lives of
his mother, Julie, and two siblings,
Lindsay and Ian.
The broken Hatch family pulled
together, and Stephen remarried.
And then lighteningstuck again.
Harder. One swift, final blow,
destroying any semblance Austin
had of a family.
When doctors pull Austin out
of the drug-induced coma that has
kept him alive since the crash, the

16-year-old will wake up to under-
stand the harshest of realities - his
only immediate family remaining
is the family dog, Brady, the other
recent survivor.
Austin's basketball career is
out of the question right now.
The 6-foot-6 prep star from Fort
Wayne, Ind. committed to Michi-
gan in June, but the focus is on sav-
ing his life, not his jump shot.
But his work ethic and prowess
on the basketball court could be
what saves his life.
"The concern regarding brain
swelling has subsided and his con-
dition continues to improve," the
Hatch Family said in a statement
Saturday. "We are encouraged by
Austin's response to the excellent
medical care he is receiving, a tes-
tament to his prior athletic train-
ing regimen."
It remains to be seen whether
Austin will ever step onto the court
at Crilser Arena under Michigan
coach John Beilein, but the Michi-
gan community is itching to do
anything it can to create a family
atmosphere for Austin.

The NCAA has relaxed its
restrictions on the recruiting
process, allowing Beilein to call
the recruit more than the typical
once-a-month limit. Beilein will be
permitted to visit Austin once he
is pulled out of the coma without
breaking NCAA regulations.
"We appreciate that they and the
Big Ten office are working with us
throughout this situation," Beilein
said in a statement released Tues-
day. "Both groups have been in
communication with our compli-
ance office and continue to provide
valuable insight on a daily basis.
"The outpouring of support
from our Michigan faithful, coach-
es, administrators and fans across
the country has been overwhelm-
ing. We are thankful for all the
support that has been offered to
the Hatch family."
With such an unpredictable
recovery timeline, Austin may
never don the maize and blue, but
he deserves a chance. Beilein will
give him every opportunity.
And Austin will fight the hard-
est imaginable battle - again.

,Hogan takes his talents to Norwegian Elite League

Goaltender looks
to rebound after
injury-laden career
By MARK BURNS
ManagingEditor
It's a date that Bryan Hogan
will probably never forget - Feb.
25, 2010.
The scenario? A first-period
breakaway stop by the former
Michigan hockey netminder
against a Notre Dame forward in
the final weekend of the regular
season.
Despite making the save on the
play, Hogan paid a price - a huge
price at that and one that left him
sprawled out on the ice for a few
minutes at Yost Ice Arena with a
groin injury. More importantly,
though, and certainly more costly,
the price Hogan paid that night
had a detrimental impact on the
rest of his career as a Wolverine.
Hogan didn't see playing time
during the rest of the 2009-10 sea-
son and upon entering2010-11, the
Highland, Mich. native and fellow

teammate Shawn Hunwick were
in a neck-and-neck race for the
No. 1 starting position.
Prior to The Big Chill at the
Big House in mid-December,
Michigan coach Red Berenson
announced Hogan would start
in front of 100,000-plus fans at
Michigan Stadium. But Hogan
didn't even play a second, as he
injured his other groin in the
pre-game warmups, solidifying
Hunwick's role as Berenson's net-
minder for the remainder of the
season.
"I'm starting to get used to
this," Hogan said the following
week to The Michigan Daily, after
Hunwick carried Michigan to a
5-0 win over Michigan State at
Michigan Stadium.
Fast forward to the present, and
Hogan has since graduated from
the University - he finished his
career with 52 wins, seven shut-
outs and a fair amount of question
marks and "what ifs."
In the end, he's decided to
forego playing in the East Coast
Hockey League and instead, play
in Europe for the upcoming year.
With the help from an agent who

he wanted to finish his degree, so
he declined to head to the profes-
sional ranks just then.
While driving home from New
York last week to train back in
Michigan and work a few goalie
camps, Hogan explained that he
hopes to eventually play in the
Swedish Elite League, the premier
league in all of Europe. And if the
opportunity arises, skate in the
American Hockey League soon
thereafter.
Former Alaska Nanook, Dion
Knelsen, is on a similar path.
Knelsen graduated in 2010 and
this past season, played in Norway
with the Sparta Warriors in the
GET-ligaen. This upcoming year,
Knelsen is skating for Mora IK
in the HockeyAllsvenksa, a step
below the Swedish Elite League.
For Hogan, though, the time
table for progressing might be a
little on the longer side, consid-
ering he hasn't played significant
minutes in over a year.
"Europe - it's just like start-
ing over again," Hogan said. "You
have to build yourself up ... Hope-
fully within three years, I can get
a good offer."

specializes in helping clients play
overseas, Hogan will head to Nor-
way in mid-August to play for
Manglerud Star in GET-ligaen,
essentially the Norwegian Elite
League.
"I'm excited to go out there,"
Hogan said last Friday. "I thought
that there's a better opportunity
for me, with regards to playing
time. I just felt like it fit me better
... It's something new. A lot of guys
bounce around in the East Coast
Hockey League, which is where I

would have been if I would have
played here."
After the Wolverines lost to
Minnesota-Duluth in overtime
in the NCAA title game this past
April, Hogan had the opportunity
to play with two ECHL teams,
with one of the teams being the
Kalamazoo K-Wings.
Hogan joked that he'd already
sold all of his equipment at the
end-of-the year garage sale the
team holds after the conclusion
of every season. Plus, he said that

Saad returns from Europe, signs with MLS

By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Michigan soccer fans may never
see record-setting freshman strik-
er Soony Saad step onto the pitch
at the U-M Soccer Complex again,
but they might catch him on TV.
According to reports, Saad has
signed a contract with the MLS
and will enter the lottery draft on
Tuesday.
Saad, the younger brother of
Hamoody Saad, a sophomore mid-
fielder for the Wolverines, spent
the past semester testing the
waters of professional soccer in
Europe after carrying Michigan to
its first-ever College Cup appear-
ance in Santa Barbara, Calif.
Reports linked him on trial with
several teams, but most notable
with Belgian giant RSC Ander-
lecht. Soony catapulted Michigan
into national contention with one
brilliant season, leading the nation
with 19 goals and 43 points in 23
games, but his departure after the
fall semester was a major setback
to the program. He set single-sea-
son records for goals (19), points

(43) and shots (152).
After being named Soccer
America Freshman of the Year,
Soony was gone.
"Soony feels that now is the right
time for him to pursue his lifelong
dream of playing professionally
overseas," Michigan coach Steve
Burns said after Soony's January
departure. "We wish him the best
in all of his future endeavors."
Fourteen MLS clubs are cur-
rently eligible to enter the weighted
lottery and bid for the prized strik-
er's services. Soony won't, however
be joining his Michigan teammate
Justin Meram with the Columbus
Crew.
Columbus drafted Meram with
the 15th-overall pick in the January
SuperDraft.
The Crew, along with the Phila-
delphia Union and Real Salt Lake,
have already signed playersthrough
the lottery. The lottery draft is in
place for players who sign with the
MLS after the SuperDraft.
Soony and Meram set a torrid
pace for the Wolverines and tore
up opposing defenses, accounting
for 36 of Michigan's 53 goals in the

2010 campaign. It will be an uphill
battle for the Wolverines on offense
this fall.
Meram and the Saad brothers
combined to make a trio dubbed the
"three amigos."
"At first, I was trying to score on
my own," Meram said after defeat-
ing Central Florida to reach the
Sweet Sixteen. "Now, I've changed
my outlook on everything.
"With Soony and Hamoody on
the attack ... no team can defend all
three of us."
Now the "three amigos" are
gone, leaving Hamoody as the last
lonesome cowboy.
But the sting of losing Soony -
the nation's top prospect and the
2009 MHSAA Mr. Soccer and 2009
Gatorade National Soccer Player
of the Year - will be felt for years
to come. While at Dearborn High
School, Soony broke the state
record as a senior with 76 goals,
finishing his high school career
with a state-record 172 goals. But
Soony's mark will certainly be left
on the Michigan soccer program.

ever goal in the new U-M Soccer

second-team All-American hon-
ors, was named Big Ten Freshman
of the Year and to the All-Big Ten
First Team, as well as the Big Ten

Now Soony has the the opportu-
nity to change Michigan's miser-
able luck in the pro ranks.

Prior to the 2011 MLS season, six
players had been drafted into MLS,
with none achieving regular start-
ing jobs.
The most glaring example of
that is forward Peri Marosevic.
Drafted No. 5 overall by FC Dallas
in 2009, Marosevic has only played
four times in league play for Dal-

Sean Bormet won't be uncom-
fortable next fall when he arrives
at Cliff Keen Arena to start his new
job - then he'll finally be home.
The Michigan wrestling pro-
gram recently announced the hir-
ing of two new assistant coaches,
including Bormet, a former Wolver-
ine wrestler.
"It's an honor and I am excited to
be heading back to the University of
Michigan," Bormet said. "Given our
extraordinary coaching staff and a
new state-of-the-art UM Wrestling
Center, I am eager to get started
and begin mentoring young men to
reach their full potential on and off
the mat."
Bormet certainly has the creden-
tials to carry on the Michigan tradi-
tion.
During his time as a student-
athlete from 1991-94, Bormet won
two consecutive Big Ten 158-pound
titles and finished his career with
a 125-21 record. A two-time recipi-
ent of the CliffKeen Award for most
outstanding Michigan wrestler,

Bormet also captured the coveted
Gorriaran Award presented to the
wrestler who scores the most pins
at the NCAA Championships.
While the list of Bormet's
achievements on the mat goes on,
his post-collegiate career is equally
as impressive.
In 2001, Bormet founded the
Overtime School of Wrestling,
which has not only shaped into the
top training center in the country,
but also shaped Bormet into a top-
tier coach. Since the opening of the
school, he has instructed everyone
from high school wrestlers and
World Championship silver medal-
ists to Olympic athletes.
With all he's accomplished,
Bormet has a right to be confident
about the skills he brings to Ann
Arbor.
"Over the last decade, I have
gained tremendous insight and
experience at every level of amateur
wrestling as a coach both nationally
and internationally," Bormet said.
Joining Bormet as second assis-
tant coach will be former colleague
Donny Pritzlaff. The two worked
briefly together at Pritzlaff's alma

mater Wisconsin, where as a stu-
dent, Pritzlaff finished his career as
one of the Badger's top wrestlers of
all time. Last year, he was inducted
into the University of Wisconsin's
Athletics Hall of Fame to honor his
contributions to the program.
"I am very excited to be at the
University of Michigan," Pritzlaff
said. "I have always had great
respect for the Michigan program.
(Head coach Joe McFarland) and
Sean are both great Michigan men
and I am positive this staff will lead
our student-athletes to excellence."
McFarland cited winningthe Big
Ten and NCAA Championships as
the primary goals for the Wolver-
ines, something his new staff mem-
bers certainly have experience with
- between the two of them, they
hold five conference titles and four
national ones.
"I consider Sean and Donny two
of the best coaches in the country,"
McFarland said. "Both of them are
champions. They are great students
of the sport. There is no question
that they are going to help elevate
this program to new and great
heights."
