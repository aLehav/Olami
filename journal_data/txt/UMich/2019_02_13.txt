Friends, 
family 
and 
several 
prominent 
politicians 
braved 
icy 
conditions to honor the 
life of former U.S. Rep. 
John Dingell at funeral 
services 
in 
Dearborn, 
Mich.
The 
longest-serving 
member of Congress in 
history and spouse of 
U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 
D-Mich., 
passed 
away 
last week at the age of 92. 
John Dingell had a heart 
attack in September and 
had been battling cancer, 
though the exact cause 
of death has not yet been 

released.
Several 
politicians, 
including 
former 
Vice 
President 
Joe 
Biden, 
U.S. Rep. John Lewis, 
D-Ga., 
and 
U.S. 
Rep. 
Fred 
Upton, 
R-Mich., 
were expected to speak 
at the services. However, 
though Biden made it in 
time, the harsh weather 
conditions 
prevented 
planes carrying Lewis, 
Upton and Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi 
from 
landing. 
Ninety 
members 
of 
Congress were expected 
to attend, however only 
a third made it to the 
service.

Inside 
the 
Shapiro 
Design Lab, located on the 
first floor of the Shapiro 
Undergraduate Library, is 
a new form of experiential 
learning: 
augmented, 
virtual and mixed reality, or 
“AVMR”, technology.
Virtual reality has been 
widely 
adopted 
within 
fields like nursing, medicine 
and dentistry, allowing for 
modeling 
and 
simulation 
in complex circumstances 
where using real people might 
be too painful or expensive. 
It can be as elaborate as 

locating symptoms that link 
to Alzheimer’s or as simple 
as simulating an elementary 
school’s trip to a zoo or 
museum across the globe.
In fact, VR has already 
found its way onto The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
campus. Jim Harbaugh, head 
coach of the University’s 
football 
team, 
uses 
VR 
to recruit potential team 
members, allowing them to 
experience “a day in the life of 
a Michigan football player.” 
The Mcity Test Facility uses 
virtual reality to test the 
reliability of self-driving cars 
in a multitude of different 

traffic scenarios that would 
otherwise be both costly 
and 
difficult 
to 
produce 
in a real-life environment. 
In the Duderstadt Center, 
medical 
students 
can 
examine a human cadaver 
through the lens of the 
Michigan 
Immersive 
Digital Experience Nexus. 
Similarly, 
the 
Computer 
and Video Game Archive 
in 
the 
basement 
of 
the 
Art, 
Architecture 
and 
Engineering 
Library 
on 
North Campus includes a 
Sony PlayStation VR, open 
for 
reservations 
for 
all 
students.

Now, 
virtual 
reality 
has made its way into the 
humanities classroom. About 
a year and a half ago, faculty 
approached 
the 
Shapiro 
Design Lab in a search for 
space 
where 
they 
could 
utilize this new technology 
and produce an immersive 
experience within their own 
coursework 
and 
research. 
The Shapiro Design Lab’s 
equipment is available by 
request and includes Oculus 
Rift, Google Cardboard and 
PlayStation VR. It opened for 
students, staff and faculty 
last year.

Tuesday 
 
night, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Central Student Government 
held a meeting during which 
Engineering 
junior 
Zeke 
Majeske, chair of the Executive 
Nominations 
Committee, 
expressed his intentions to 
pursue an ethics investigation 
against CSG President Daniel 
Greene, a Public Policy senior. 
Majeske brought up two 
main issues with Greene’s 
past behavior to the Student 
Assembly. 
He 
began 
by 
discussing his belief that the 
president misled the Assembly 
in an attempt to sway the 
potential override of his veto 
of A.R. 8-033, a resolution 
discussed last week titled “A 
Resolution to Reschedule SOFC 
Chair 
Confirmations.” 
The 
resolution proposes to change 
the process of selecting the 
Student Organization Funding 
chair: 
the 
representative 
leading the SOFC, the CSG 
committee 
in 
charge 
of 
allocating funds to various 
student organizations.

Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 
delivered her State of the 
State address to Michigan 
lawmakers Tuesday night at 
the state capitol in Lansing. 
Whitmer 
began 
her 

address with a joke about 
being asked to “fix the damn 
weather” — a nod to one of 
her main campaign refrains 
to “fix the damn roads.” 
After 
thanking 
members 
of the state legislature for 
attending, Whitmer dedicated 
the majority of her speech 

to 
discussing 
her 
plans 
for 
repairing 
Michigan’s 
infrastructure and education 
system. 
“Turning a blind eye or 
passing phony fixes won’t solve 
our problems,” Whitmer said. 
“In fact, they make it harder. 
Filling potholes instead of 

rebuilding roads. Pretending 
that little increases can fix an 
education crisis like we have 
… A government that does not 
work today can’t get the job 
done for tomorrow and that 
ends now.” 

the


Build a Better Michigan 
will have to pay a $37,500 
fine 
after 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Jocelyn 
Benson 
determined 
Friday 
that 
the nonprofit organization 
violated 
campaign 
laws 
with advertisements run in 
support of Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer.
Build a Better Michigan 
was formed by Whitmer 
allies, 
and 
spent 
more 
than 
$2.4 
million 
in 
the 
2018 
election. 
The 
group ran a series of ads 
they described as “issue 

advocacy,” exempting them 
from the Michigan Finance 
Campaign Act.
The 
Michigan 
Finance 
Campaign 
Act 
requires 
financial disclosures from 
all groups. Political action 
committees 
that 
support 
a certain candidate must 
also file reports with the 
Michigan 
Department 
of 
State. 
However, because Build 
a Better Michigan filed its 
organization under Section 
527 of the Internal Revenue 
Code, it cannot advocate 
directly for a candidate. 
Since 
they 
are 
not 
independent 
from 

Whitmer’s campaign, there 
are limits on how much 
money 
the 
organization 
could spend.
Benson said in a letter to 
the 
lawyers 
representing 
Build a Better Michigan and 
Whitmer’s campaign that 
two particular ads were the 
main area of concern.
“I 
conclude 
that 
the 
phrase, ‘Gretchen Whitmer 
| Candidate for Governor,’ 
constitutes 
express 
advocacy,” Benson wrote. 
“… I view this interpretation 
of the MCFA, as applied to 
this specific set of facts, 
as critical to promoting 
greater transparency.”
The two ads showed 
Whitmer 
speaking 
on 
camera with the words 
“Gretchen 
Whitmer, 
Candidate for Governor.” 
The complaint filed by 
the Michigan Republican 
Party and a conservative 
group claimed Build a 
Better Michigan should 
have 
disclosed 
their 
direct 
advocacy 
for 
Whitmer. 
According 
to 
Colleen Pero, the chief 
of staff for the Michigan 
Republican 
Party, 
the 
ads 
advocated 
for 
Whitmer by identifying 
her as a candidate for 
governor and indicated 
collaboration 
between 
Whitmer 
and 
Build 
a 
Better Michigan.
Benson said by doing so, 
the group violated state 
campaign finance law.
“The fact that BBM 
obtained video and audio 
of the candidate speaking 
directly to the camera 
from 
a 
predetermined 
script 
is 
sufficient 
to 
indicate that coordination 

occurred,” Benson wrote.
The fine will be paid 
within 
the 
next 
two 
months. 
GOP 
spokesman 
Tony Zammit said he was 
unhappy and called the 
entire 
deal 
“shameful.” 
The Michigan GOP said 
they thought Benson and 
Whitmer had worked out a 
deal for a smaller fine.
Benson’s 
spokesman 
Shawn Starkey told The 
Detroit News Benson did 
not believe the fine was on 
the smaller scale and she 
asked her staff to keep the 
context of the case in mind 
when deciding.

Public Policy junior Katie 
Kelly, 
communications 
director for the University 
of Michigan’s Chapter of 
College 
Democrats, 
said 
no party is above violating 
campaign laws.

WINDING DOWN WITH WAFFLES

ON THE DAILY: 

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: 
COMMUNITY REJOICES AFTER MANDELA’S RELEASE

While the 61st annual Grammy 
Awards honored many prominent 
celebrities, some notable Michiganders 
also left the Grammy Awards victorious 
on Sunday.
Michigan band Greta Van Fleet 
won Best Rock Album for “From the 
Fires,” despite being nominated in a 

competitive field. The nominees for Best 
Rock Album included heavyweights 
Alice in Chains, Fall Out Boy and 
Weezer. Members Josh Kiszka, Jake 
Kiszka, Sam Kiszka and drummer 
Danny Wagner formed the band in 
Frankenmuth, Michigan in 2012.
A singer for Mack Avenue Records, 
a record label based in Grosse Pointe 
Farms, Mich., also won a Grammy. 
Mack’s artist, Cecile McLorin Salvant, 

won Best Jazz Vocal Album for “The 
Window.” This is fitting, as Mack 
Avenue Records specializes in jazz and 
similar music and is a sponsor of the 
Detroit Jazz Festival, to which Mack 
Avenue Records founder Gretchen 
Carhartt Valade donated $15 million 
in 2006. While this is Greta Van Fleet’s 
first Grammy award, Mack Avenue 
Records has boasted previous awards 
from its slate of recording artists, 

including Stanley Clarke, Alfredo 
Rodríguez, 
Jimmy 
Greene, 
Kirk 
Whalum and Christian McBride.
Other notable award recipients at 
this year’s Grammy Awards include 
Childish Gambino, who won record and 
song of the year for “This is America,” 
despite not attending the awards show; 
Dua Lipa, who won Best New Artist; 
and Kacey Musgraves, who won Album 
of the Year for “Golden Hour.”

Feb. 12, 1990
Beating drums, singing songs, 
and dancing arm in arm, members 
of the Ann Arbor community 
converged on the Diag last night 
to celebrate yesterday’s release 
of former South African political 
prisoner Nelson Mandela. 
“Our struggle has reached a 
new level because our comrade 
Nelson is finally free to walk 

the streets in Africa,” shouted 
Paquetta Palmer, a member 
of the Free Southern Africa 
steering committee and the 
Washtenaw County Coalition 
Against Apartheid. The two anti-
apartheid groups organized the 
celebration along with the United 
Coalition Against Racism. 
Speakers 
stressed 
that 
Mandela’s 
release 
was 
the 

result of the people’s struggle in 
South Africa, and that the event 
should not be looked upon as an 
initiative for change by President 
F.W. De Klerk and the national 
government.
“When we look at the situation 
in South Africa, we know the 
government has been and will be 
the enemy of the Blacks,” UCAR 
steering committee member Pam 

Nadasen told the crowd. “When 
the De Klerk’s are replaced by 
the Mandela’s in the presidential 
palace, then we can celebrate 
victory in South Africa.”
Another 
UCAR 
steering 
committee 
member, 
Barbara 
Ransby, 
echoed 
Nadasen 
sentiment. 
“We 
don’t 
come 
here to praise the South African 
government.”

Pro-Whitmer group fined $37.5k for 
violating state campaign finance laws

Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson penalizes Build a Better Michigan for ads

“We strive to 
promote fair 
campaigns and 
elections and it is 
disheartening to 
see these kinds of 
violations within 
our own party.”

“Campaign 
finance 
violations are wrong no 
matter 
the 
party 
that 
commits 
them,” 
Kelly 
said. “As an organization, 
we strive to promote fair 
campaigns 
and 
elections 
and it is disheartening to 
see these kinds of violations 
within our own party.”
The University’s chapter 
of College Republicans did 
not comment in time for 
publication. 
Build a Better Michigan 
spokesman 
Mark 
Fisk 
said 
in 
a 
statement 
he 
was 
disappointed 
with 
the decision, but accepted 
Benson’s conclusion.
“Build a Better Michigan’s 
advertising is part of a long 
tradition of issue advocacy 
used for years in Michigan 
by both parties and we’re 
proud to have played a 
role promoting affordable 
health 
care, 
improved 
infrastructure 
and 
clean 

water,” Fisk said. “While 
we 
respectfully 
disagree 
with 
the 
secretary 
of 
state’s determination and 
settlement, we fully intend 
to comply with her ruling 
to put this matter behind us 
and move forward.”

LSA 
sophomore 

Maeve Skelly worked on 
Whitmer’s 
campaign. 
She said she agreed with 
Benson’s decision, adding 
she thought the fine was 
overall a step in the right 
direction 
toward 
better 
communication 
between 
government officials and 
the public.
“I think that this fine 
was justified and I think 
that Jocelyn Benson did 
the right thing setting a 
precedent for transparency 
in 
campaigns 
going 
forward and to make sure 
the Michigan’s Campaign 
Finance Law is upheld,” 
Skelly said.

The 
proposed 
process 
would have the outgoing 
SOFC chair nominate at least 
two individuals to take their 
place. Further, the chair of 
the Executive Nominations 
Committee would vet the 
nominees and present them 
to the Assembly, who would 
vote to confirm the position. 
Prior 
to 
last 
week’s 
CSG 
meeting, 
in 
which 
the 
Assembly 
discussed 
the veto of the resolution, 
Greene released a statement 
describing his decision to 
veto. According to Greene, if 
certain changes were made to 
the resolution, then he would 
highly consider approving it.
“There’s a few changes 
(I’d like to make),” Greene 
said. “One is who does the 
nomination of the successor 
to the SOFC chair. Another 
concern 
was 
about 
this 
philosophy or idea of business 
not carrying over to the next 

assembly… and there was 
also the big question that 
sometimes — not always — the 
outgoing SOFC chair becomes 
treasurer, and so if the SOFC 
chair is nominating their 
successor, do they nominate 
themselves if they’re not a 
graduating senior?”
In his report to the council, 
Majeske described his issue 
with Greene’s handling of the 
resolution. 
“He claimed further that 
the 
resolution 
contained 
certain provisions that it did 
not, as well as contradicting 
his previous statements and 
claiming that if one seemingly 
insignificant 
change 
was 
made, he would be in favor of 
the resolution,” Majeske said.
In 
addition, 
Majeske 
claims, 
in 
Greene’s 
introduction of the vetoed 
resolution, the president led 
people to believe the interests 
of SOFC were not taken into 
consideration when writing 
the resolution. 
According to Greene, he 

spoke to Anthony Garvey, the 
current chair of SOFC, and 
Nico Beltramo, the former 
chair, and both agreed with 
Greene’s 
concerns 
with 
the SOFC resolution. Both 
members also approved of 
the veto statement Greene 
released.
“The veto statement went 
through a vetting process 
by 
the 
communications 
director, the student general 
council, 
the 
individuals 
who helped me author the 
letter, and no one took issue 
with what is in the public 
veto statements,” Greene 
said. “I believe that the 
issues the representative 
is 
concerned 
about 
are 
political in nature in the 
sense 
that 
it’s 
different 
interpretations and analysis 
of what’s written there, not 
matters of facts of what’s 
physically there.”
After further discussion, 
Speaker of the Assembly 
and 
Rackham 
student 
Austin Glass stated that 

the first issue was resolved 
and would no longer be 
discussed by the Assembly. 
The second issue Majeske 
focused on pertained to 
the 
nomination 
process 
for new members of the 
Assembly. Specifically, he 
believes Greene engaged in 
unethical behavior, which 
resulted in the confirmation 
of Saveri Nandigama as CSG 
chief of staff.
The 
president 
came 
to 
the 
Executive 
Nominations 
Committee 
with recommendations for 
three candidates for the 
CSG positions of treasurer, 
chair of a commission and 
COS. The committee gave 
positive recommendations 
on two of the nominees, 
but did not give a positive 
recommendation to the COS 
position. 

Despite weather delays, 
funeral services carried 
on with a liturgy from Rev. 
Terrence Kerner, who said 
John Dingell wished for a 
celebratory yet respectful 
service. 
Kerner 
said 
John Dingell was about 
fighting for the ordinary 
man, and shared stories 
from constituents whose 
lives 
were 
bettered 
by 
his policies. “But I think 
when a common man knew 
John Dingell, he probably 
felt he was uncommon,” 
Kerner said.
In 
a 
lighthearted 
eulogy, Biden said John 
Dingell was one of the few 

politicians he looked up to 
as an outspoken champion 
of health care and labor 
rights. He said it was John 
Dingell’s belief that every 
single 
person 
deserves 
dignity that made him a 
successful legislator.
“Dignity was how John 
walked,” 
Biden 
said. 
“Dignity was how John 
talked. Dignity was how 
John carried himself. And 
more than that, it was how 
he treated everyone — and 
I mean everyone.”
Thursday, more funeral 
services 
will 
be 
held 
in 
Washington, 
D.C., 
where former President 
Bill Clinton and former 
Speaker John Boehner are 
expected to speak.

Elgass explained the team 
aims to better sexual health 
and literacy on campus and 
beyond. She said BusyBox was 
born when members of the 
team recognized a gap in the 
sexual-health market.
“What we found talking 
to friends and people around 
campus and customers, in 
general, is that these products 
are 
very 
widely 
available, 
but a lot times people feel 
uncomfortable buying them,” 
Elgass said. “As a result, it can 
be a barrier for people using 
these supplies.”
Smolinski 
described 
the 
contents of the box, which 
includes safe-sex items as 
well as pamphlets discussing 
relevant sexual health topics. 
“(These products include) 
internal 
and 
external 
condoms, personal lubricant, 
dental dams and pregnancy 
and UTI tests,” Smolinski 
said. “It also comes with 
BusyBox-made 
infographics 
with topics such as consent, 
healthy relationships, gender 
and sexuality, and emergency 
contraception.”
Carter said the team set 
out to better the way college 
students purchase and use 
sexual 
and 
reproductive 
health products.

“We want to foster people’s 
ability 
to 
have 
safe 
and 
consensual and pleasurable 
and 
informed 
sexual 
experiences,” 
Carter 
said. 
“We want to market towards 
anyone 
out 
there 
who 
is 
having sex or thinking about 
having sex soon and wants to 
be prepared for it.”
Elgass 
echoed 
Carter’s 
thoughts, and added that they 
want to encourage people’s 
confidence surrounding sex 
while making sure they stay 
safe. 
“We are trying to be that 
middle ground of, ‘Yeah, you 
should be having sex in the 
way you want to have sex 
and that is a great thing, but 
also be doing it safely and be 
prepared,’” Elgass said. “Our 
product is designed to make 
you confident and prepared 
so it’s not something that you 
should be ashamed of in any 
way.”
To appeal to individuals, the 
process is catered to customers, 
allowing them to select items 
each month, Smolinski said. 
“It is all tailored to the user, 
so they have an online profile 
where they click and choose 
what they want in their box 
and it comes to them either 
once a month, every other 
month or every two months,” 
Smolinski said.
Smolinski 
also 
described 

how the supplies come in a 
discreet, unlabeled white box 
in order to keep a customer’s 
personal and sexual health 
private. Additionally, since the 
box is customizable, it is not 
geared towards a particular 
gender and the products can 
be used for anyone.
LSA 
sophomore 
Soraya 
Zrikem said the customizable 
aspect 
of 
BusyBox 
might 
be 
something 
especially 
appealing for customers. 
“I think that a lot of people 
do value privacy and what 
they want to be buying and I 
think that would be totally 
valuable,” Zrikem said. “With 
any of these services, if it is 
something as personal as your 
sex life, you would want to 
customize it… that definitely 
makes it more attractive.”
Zrikem 
added 
that 
the 
privacy of BusyBox is also a 
draw, as many people might 
be anxious when going into a 
store to buy sex items. 
“I don’t know how taboo 
buying condoms and lube and 
stuff is as an adult, but for 
people who are uncomfortable 
with that… they don’t have to 
deal with the embarrassment 
or social anxiety that can 
come along with doing those 
things,” Zrikem said.
However, 
Zrikem 
questioned the service being a 
subscription, worrying people 

might get the supplies but not 
use them.
“I feel like it would be 
more successful if it weren’t 
a subscription,” Zrikem said. 
“I feel like people’s sex lives… 
they aren’t as regular, like 
your period or shaving… It 
would require people to know 
how much they’d be having 
sex. ”
This project is a years in the 
making, and has recently put 
up pre-order opportunities 
on their website, according to 
Elglass. 
“This past year was about 
taking the idea and developing 
the 
plans 
and 
getting 
inventory,” Elgass said. “We 
just launched our pre-orders 
so our website is now live and 
you can preorder your box 
for the beginning of March — 
right around spring break is 
when we’ll start shipping.”
When 
asked 
about 
the 
future of BusyBox, Mason said 
she is excited to see where 
the first year of their startup 
business is going to take her 
and her teammates.
“This is a really exciting time 
for us to see how much we can 
grow in the first year.” Mason 
said. “Ideally I would love to 
do this full time … I hope that 
we are able to be successful 
and keep that success going for 
years to come.”

“Are we in some

to tell their own

of VR projects, 
those questions 
become even more

Justin 
Schell, 
director 
of the Shapiro Design Lab, 
has seen a spike in interest 
in 
the 
incorporation 
of 
virtual reality in all types 
of classrooms.
“Virtual 
reality 
was 
something that more people 
were interested in using 
on central campus,” Schell 
said. 
“Different 
faculty 
wanted to use it to explore 
and add it as part of their 
classes. It ranges from fully 
immersive 
headsets 
like 
Oculus and HTC Vive and 
PlayStation, to more lo-fi 
VR like Google Cardboard. 
There’s 
been 
interest 
from 
American 
culture 
and history classes; film, 
television and media studies 
classes — all the way to 
electrical engineering and 
computer science.”
English 
professor 
Sara 
Blair 
took 
her 
How 
to 
Read 
Images 
class 
to 
the design lab to create 
a dialogue pertaining to 
the way in which images 
shape societies’ “collective 
experience.” In this setting, 
students were immersed in 
a video experience related 
to the Syrian civil war and 
refugee crisis.
“One of the longstanding 
concerns about imaging and 
particular photography is 
wondering 
what 
damage 
or injury we might do to 
other people by capturing 
them in photographs and 
sharing 
and 
responding 
to their experience from 
a 
distance,” 
Blair 
said. 
“Are 
we 
appropriating 
the experience? Are we in 
some ways impeding their 
opportunities to tell their 
own stories? But, around 
a series of VR projects, 
those 
questions 
become 
even more powerful: What 
does it mean to try to know 
the experience of refugees 
or people who have been 
traumatized 
by 
wars 
or 
subject to disasters either 
human or natural? What 
kind of knowledge do we 
get?”
Lisa Nakamura, director 
of 
the 
Digital 
Studies 
Institute, brings many of 
her classes including The 
Internet is a Trash Fire to 
the Design Lab to use virtual 
reality as a way to relate to 
marginalized people, and 
thus create a greater scale 
of understanding.
“I 
was 
originally 
interested in virtual reality 
because there is so much 
journalism about how it 
can create more empathy,” 
Nakamura 
said. 
“People 
who don’t understand or 
want to feel more kind to 
refugees, the blind, people 
of color can now experience 
life 
through 
their 
point 
of view and stand in their 
shoes. Studies even show 
that having a female avatar 
in a video game can be 
empowering because you 
see yourself there.”
However, 
one 
of 
Nakamura’s 
students, 
LSA 
sophomore 
Riley 
McMahon, had a negative 
experience with the device 
when someone over virtual 
reality 
used 
derogatory 
terms in an attempt to have 
a conversation with her.
“I 
was 
a 
little 
uncomfortable 
using 
the 
device and talking to people 
I didn’t know,” McMahon 
said. “He got angry that I 
wasn’t conversing with him 

and started swearing.”
Nakamura acknowledges 
this risk when working with 
virtual reality and decided 
to use the experience to 
generate 
a 
conversation 
about 
the 
negatives 

spawned 
by 
the 
certain 
affordances 
the 
internet 
provides.
“It became an interesting 
lesson on how the internet 
can 
be 
toxic 
and 
not 
necessarily a kind place,” 
Nakamura said.
The 
Shapiro 
Design 
Lab is not just used by 
humanities professors, but 
by 
humanities 
students 
as 
well. 
Jeff 
Edelstein, 
recent graduate from the 
School of Education, has 
used Shapiro’s VR within 
his own work regarding 
students with disabilities 
and the ways in which they 
are represented in video 
games.
“I 
worked 
with 
the 
Shapiro 
Design 
Lab 
in 
partner with a group I ran 
called 
Disability 
Culture 
at U-M,” Edelstein said. 
“VR is still relatively a new 
thing; they are still finding 
new ways to make it work. 
One great game is ‘Moss.’ 
You are able to choose 
a 
mouse 
character 
that 
communicates with you via 
American Sign Language. It 
helps start a conversation 
related to inclusivity and 
representation in gaming.”
VR is not just a tool for 
STEM 
fields, 
Nakamura 
said. It can be applicable 
to any type of classroom 
setting, even those in the 
humanities. She hopes to 
see a rise in this technology, 
a technology she believes 
can help create a new story.
“I 
think 
our 
students 
should 
be 
using 
the 
latest technology in our 
humanities 
classes,” 
Nakamura 
said. 
“North 
Campus has a lot of that, 
and we take it for granted. 
People 
doing 
arts 
and 
literature and media should 
get the same access. It is a 
new kind of storytelling, 
and a new kind of medium, 
where I feel like people 
who are more interested in 
the humanities are able to 
talk about how it works on 
emotions and what visual 
traditions it’s in, and what 
kind of experiences you 
can have there, which is 
different than using it as 
just a tool. We’re talking 
about it more as an object to 
study, as well as a tool.”

The 
Michigan 
Section 
of 
the 
American 
Society 
of 
Civil 
Engineers 
gave 
Michigan a D+ grade in 
infrastructure overall and 
a D- grade for state roads in 
their Infrastructure Report 
Card, with only 18 percent 
of roads being considered in 
good 
condition.. 
Whitmer 
asked Michiganders to share 
their personal experiences 
with what she called an 
“infrastructure crisis.”
“We 
need 
to 
act 
now 
though, before a catastrophe 
happens, 
before 
the 
situation 
becomes 
truly 
unrecoverable,” 
Whitmer 
said. “To everyone at home 
who is tuning in: Share 
your stories about what the 
infrastructure crisis means 
to you. Take a picture of your 
damaged car or your repair 
bill or a pothole outside 
your house and post it with 
#FTDR.”
Whitmer 
further 
expressed 
concerns 
over 
education. A report from 
researchers 
at 
Michigan 
State University released in 
January found Michigan’s 
public school financing was 
nearly 20 percent lower than 
it was in the 1990s, a drop in 
funding unparalleled in any 
other state in the country. 
Whitmer said the money in 
the state budget typically 
used for K-12 funding has 
been used to fill other areas 
of the state budget. She 
blamed the government, not 
the educators or students, 
for 
allowing 
Michigan’s 
education system to falter.
“I want to send a message 
to all the devoted educators 
across Michigan: You’re not 
failing us. We have been 
failing you,” Whitmer said. 
“Our 
educators 
and 
our 
kids deserve our support, 

not a funding crisis that 
undermines the work in the 
classroom, that weakens our 
schools and compromises the 
education.” 
Whitmer laid out her plans 
that included three separate 
pathways for high school 
graduates. For those already 
in the workforce, Whitmer 
detailed 
her 
“Michigan 
Reconnect” 
plan, 
which 
will teach already employed 
individuals new skills to 
adjust 
to 
the 
changing 
workplace. 
Her 
“My 
Opportunity” 
scholarship 
program offers two years 
of 
community 
college 
free 
to 
graduating 
high 
school seniors seeking an 
associate’s degree. The third 
pathway would be another 
scholarship under the “My 
Opportunity” program, but 
would give two years free to 
students attending a public 
four year institution. 
In response to President 
Donald Trump’s new health 
care plans, Whitmer said 
she wrote to the president to 
defend the Affordable Care 
Act. She personally thanked 
Attorney 
General 
Dana 
Nessel for leading the fight. 
Whitmer 
ended 
her 
address 
by 
promising 
to 
work with both parties. She 
believes working together 
is the best way to help 
Michigan. 
“The enemy is not the 
person 
across 
the 
aisle,” 
Whitmer said. “The enemy is 
apathy, the enemy is extreme 
partisanship. The enemy is 
self-interest. When we stand 
together as Michiganders … 
we can get the job done for 
the people of our state. 
One 
of 
Whitmer’s 
administration’s 
priorities 
is 
addressing 
hazardous 
water conditions, she said. 
Even though Flint water was 
tested and found to have its 

lowest levels of lead since 
before the water crisis, other 
contaminants such as PFAS 
are polluting the Great Lakes 
and the state’s rivers. 
In order to support the next 
generation of entrepreneurs 
in 
the 
region, 
Whitmer 
made a promise to connect 
small 
businesses 
with 
contracting 
opportunities. 
She said promoting economic 
development 
in 
Michigan 
meant 
supporting 
in-state 
investment.
In her speech, Whitmer 
noted 
her 
filing 
of 
an 
executive directive to ban 
the use of private emails 
for governmental purposes. 
She also extended the use 
of Freedom of Information 
Act requests to the executive 
department 
of 
the 
state 
government. Whitmer also 
filed 
executive 
directives 
in 
January 
prohibiting 
employers 
from 
asking 
all 
applicants 
what 
their 
past salaries were as well 
as 
a 
directive 
banning 
state 
government 
from 
discriminating 
based 
on 
gender identity or sexual 
orientation.
State 
Rep. 
Matt 
Hall, 
R-Emmett, told The Daily he 
was concerned Whitmer did 
not offer a payment plan for 
any of her initiatives.
“I thought there were a 
lot of good sounding ideas,” 
Hall said. “However, I want 
to see how we’re going to 
pay for it before I decided 
whether I want to support 
the proposals. I think that 
anytime you’re promising 
large expansions of new 
government 
programs, 
you have to also identify 
how you’re going to pay 
for it and I did not hear 
anything from the governor 
about how she intends to 
pay for these programs. 
I will say that makes me 

very concerned that she’s 
proposing 
enormous 
tax 
increases. The last time 
Michigan was a high tax 
state, we led the country in 
job loss.” 
Despite 
some 
worries 
from Republican legislators, 
Michigan’s 
Democrats 
seemed to leave the address 
with largely positive feelings. 
Minority Floor Leader Yousef 
Rabhi, D-Ann Arbor, told The 
Daily he was overall very 
satisfied 
with 
Whitmer’s 
speech. 
“I thought it was amazing,” 
Rabhi said. “It was great to 
have an opportunity to listen 
to a speech where I actually 
wanted to stand up for a good 
chunk of it and it was just so 
cool to hear her talk about the 
skills gap and how we’re going 
to address it. Talking about 
funding for our education, 
community 
colleges 
and 
higher education and then 
our environment. The fact 
that she talked about clean 
water and the work we need 
to do in that category. There’s 
so much that this governor 
is passionate about that she 
outlined in the speech and 
I am just so excited to work 
with her and get some of this 
stuff done.” 
Paul Ajegba, director of 
the 
Michigan 
Department 
of Transportation, told The 
Daily 
he 
was 
especially 
pleased with her plans to 
improve the workplace. 
“I was in the meetings 
that 
she 
mentioned 
with 
all the executives,” Ajegba 
said. “There was a common 
theme Michigan workforce, 
the supply is not meeting the 
demand, which means a lot of 
these companies are going to 
out of state because we’re not 
producing enough workforce 
to meet that demand. I think 
she did an outstanding job 
today.”

“

Brokeback 
Mountain” 

is probably my favorite 
movie. Not only are Heath 

Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal 
phenomenal actors, but the film 
is also moving in a way that 
isn’t overly theatrical. The plot 
itself is quite simple, and there 
are no cliché scenes dramatized 
by overpowering music and 
overdone camerawork that are 
present in so many other films 
today.

Ledger 
and 
Gyllenhaal 

received accolades for their roles 
at the time of the film’s release, 
including Gyllenhaal’s British 
Academy Film and Television 
Arts award for Best Actor in a 
Supporting Role and Ledger’s 
New York Film Critics Circle 
award for Best Actor. Both 
actors also received praise for 
their willingness to be a part of a 
movie that was controversial for 
depicting a love story between 
two men at a time when movies 
featuring 
heterosexual 
love 

stories such as “Mr. and Mrs. 
Smith,” “A Cinderella Story” and 
“The Notebook” were popular.

At the time of the film’s 

release, 
no 
one 
seemed 
to 

question why two straight men 
were chosen to play the roles of 
two decidedly not straight men. 
This was most likely because 
there were few movies being 
produced at the time that did 
feature gay characters or love 
stories. Either no one thought 
to say anything — or they chose 
not to.

However, in 2019, celebrities 

are 
being 
held 
accountable 

for 
their 
past 
problematic 

productions 
and 
roles. 
In 

particular, white actors who 
played non-white roles and non-
queer actors who played gender 
queer 
characters 
are 
being 

heavily criticized for choosing to 
play a role that was never theirs 
to take. Yet no straight actor 
who chose to play, or is currently 
playing, a non-straight character 
receives public backlash. In fact, 
many of these actors are loved 
by the LGBTQ+ community for 
their roles: Darren Criss’ Blaine 
in “Glee” and Shay Mitchell’s 
Emily in “Pretty Little Liars” 
are both well loved. Neither 
actor has received backlash 
for portraying gay characters. 
Neither 
have 
Ledger 
and 

Gyllenhaal for their portrayals 
of Ennis Del Mar and Jack 
Twist, 
respectively, 
in 

“Brokeback Mountain.” Why 
is that?

Perhaps people have chosen 

to 
refrain 
from 
attacking 

Ledger’s portrayal of Del Mar 
out of respect for his death. Yet 
Gyllenhaal, Criss and Mitchell 
have 
all 
escaped 
criticism 

for 
their 
characters 
and 

performances while other actors 
who have played roles that don’t 
align with their identity, such 
as Emma Stone, who played an 
Asian-American character in 
“Aloha,” and Scarlett Johansson, 
who also played a traditionally 
Asian character in “Ghost in 

the Shell” – both who have 
been heavily rebuked for their 
roles. Eddie Redmayne has 
also been criticized by the 
transgender 
community 
for 

playing 
transgender 
woman 

Lili 
Elbe 
in 
“The 
Danish 

Girl” and Johansson recently 
dropped her role in the movie 
“Rub & Tug,” where she would 
have played a transgender man, 
after heavy backlash from the 
transgender community.

These actors have also been 

the butt of some jokes: Sandra 
Oh made a joke about Johansson 
and Stone’s roles as characters of 
Asian descent during her Emmys 
monologue, quipping, “(Crazy 
Rich Asians) is the first studio 
film with an Asian-American 
lead since ‘Ghost in the Shell’ 
and 
‘Aloha.’” 
Stone 
could 

then be heard yelling, “I’m 
sorry!” over the sounds of the 
audience laughing.

While Redmayne has been 

mostly lauded by cis people for 
his role in “The Danish Girl,” 
even 
snagging 
an 
Academy 

Award 
nomination 
for 
his 

work, he has been put under 
scrutiny by members of the trans 
community. Carol Grant, a trans 
female writer, explained her 
ire with Redmayne’s role in the 
movie in an IndieWire article, 
commenting, “For a film that’s 
being touted as a progressive 
step 
up 
for 
‘transgender 

visibility’, 
everything 
about 

its view of trans women and 
women in general is regressive, 
reductive, 
and 
contributes 

to harmful stereotypes: the 
cisnormative 
idea 
that 
a 

trans woman is simply a man 
performing faux-femininity, as 
Redmayne twirls and vogues 
his way into womanhood.” She 
also criticizes the way in which 
the movie portrays Elbe as 
being weak, condemning “the 
reductive portrait of a trans 
woman as a figure of pity whose 
tragedy stems from being a man 
unable to ‘practice womanhood’, 
rather 
than 
accepting 
her 

womanhood as natural fact; 
the 
arguments 
that 
TERFs 

(trans-exclusionary 
radical 

feminists) love to perpetuate 
that trans women only reinforce 
outdated gender stereotypes; 
the leering at a trans woman’s 
body as something unnatural 
and abnormal instead of inviting 
the audience to understand our 
dysphoria.”

Grant’s 
argument 
about 

the problematic nature of “The 
Danish Girl” suggests the reason 

that so many people have a 
problem 
with 
whitewashing 

and cisgender actors playing 
trans characters, while they 
don’t often have a problem with 
straight characters playing gay 
characters, is because of the 
stark difference between the 
accuracy in which the characters 
are portrayed. Grant does not 
approve of Redmayne’s casting 
and performance because he, 
as a cisgender man, cannot 
accurately portray a transgender 
woman. This is true not only 
because he is a man playing 
a woman but also because he 
perpetuates false cisnormative 
beliefs about trans-ness. People 
take umbrage with Johansson 
and Stone’s portrayals of Asian-
American characters because 
white people cannot accurately 
portray characters of Asian 
descent. This is a visibility 
issue: Being white automatically 
disqualifies an actor for playing 
a character of Asian descent, 
since they don’t look Asian.

With gay characters, most 

performances have not been 
marred by stereotypes and 
instead have allowed members 
of the LGBTQ+ community 
to 
feel 
authentically 

represented in popular culture. 
Furthermore, 
there 
is 
no 

visibility issue. “Pretty Little 
Liars” Emily isn’t portrayed 
as a masculine character who 
chops her hair and makes 
unwanted passes on straight 
girls; 
Glee’s 
Blaine 
isn’t 

portrayed 
as 
an 
extremely 

effeminate 
character 
who 

loves shopping or tokenized 
as the “gay best friend.” Del 
Mar and Twist of “Brokeback 
Mountain,” 
similarly, 
aren’t 

portrayed as feminine, and 
are 
actually 
portrayed 
as 

being quite masculine, which 
combats 
stereotypes 
about 

gay men. Furthermore, people 
who are not straight don’t have 
an obvious “look” to them, as 
people of different races do.

I wonder, then, if this 

permission from the LGBTQ+ 
community for straight actors 
to play queer characters is 
at all contextual: If a movie 
centered around the life of 
a 
gay 
activist 
is 
released 

and the activist is played 
by a straight actor, is that 
still acceptable? Regardless, 
representation 
in

continues to be a multifaceted 
topic 
and 
the 
LGBTQ+ 

community’s willingness to 
allow 
non-straight 
actors 

to 
play 
gay 
characters 

shouldn’t 
be 
exploited 
to 

argue 
against 
problematic 

aspects of Hollywood, such as 
whitewashing. This selective 
outrage is not reflective of 
irrational anger or pettiness. 
Rather, it is because in an 
industry where representation 
is iffy at best, Hollywood may 
have gotten it right.

What of a woman’s strength?

W

atching Justice Ruth 

Bader 
Ginsburg, 

played by Felicity 

Jones, climb the steps 

of the Supreme Court 

moments 
before 

the 
credits 
rolled 

elicited not only an 

emotional 
reaction 

from 
the 
theater’s 

crowd, 
but 
also 

spurred my thinking 

on the emphasis on 

the recent portrayals 

of strong women in 

the media.

Looking 
back, 
the 
2016 

presidential 
election 
cycle 

brought this conversation to 

the forefront in a re-energized 

way. With a female candidate 

as the presidential nominee on 

a major party ticket for the first 

time, the conversation in the 

unending news cycle created 

a constant critique of what it 

meant to be a female leader. 

Hillary Clinton was under the 

media 
microscope 
— 
facing 

gender-related commentary on 

her political approaches and 

decisions. After the elections 

came to a close, there was a 

tangible 
energy 
increase 
in 

American women and, since 

then, our media have sought to 

capture it.

Strong women have come to 

the forefront of television news, 

shows and movies. From two 

films coming out within the year 

about a Supreme Court justice 

who has championed gender 

equality on the legal front, to 

numerous 
female 
politicians 

announcing 
their 
candidacy 

for 2020, to actor Regina King 

vowing 
that 
everything 
she 

produces moving forward will 

be at least 50 percent female, 

being powerful and female is 

now, more than ever, a hot topic. 

This leads me to wonder: How 

can I be strong in my own 

right 
and 
what 
constitutes 

being strong according to this 

popular narrative?

According 
to 
Comedy 

Central’s satirical cartoon South 

Park, in which they have a 

character duly named 

the 
Vice 
Principal 

Strong 
Woman, 

this 
feminine 

persona is rooted in 

stubbornness 
and 

having 
qualities 

equal 
to 
that 

of 
a 
man. 
This 

interpretation, albeit 

very hyperbolic, of 

powerful 
women 

in 
society 
does 

hold a grain of truth. Women 

in 
positions 
of 
power 
are 

portrayed and evaluated on 

these characteristics and are 

generally, though not always, 

expected to comport in this 

limiting way.

So how do I as a college 

student fit into this narrative? 

What do strong women look like 

as young adults, still searching 

for their passions and places, 

instead 
of 
as 
professionals? 

Can we dare to break free from 

this mold, or has society in its 

championing of women already 

tried to do this?

I believe the idea of strength 

is entirely subjective and to be 

powerful can mean so many 

different things to people. The 

ability to perform equally to 

male peers can be approached 

in numerous ways, instead of 

the stereotypical way media 

presents it to us. Being strong 

can take form in silence, in 

being outgoing, in spearheading 

initiatives or in being a good 

team member. One does not have 

to embody the “Vice Principal 

Strong Woman” aura to be taken 

seriously.

So, as we move forward 

into 2019, I intend to answer 

Regina King’s call to lift up 

other women. Let’s encourage 

others to be comfortable in 

their own definitions of what 

strong is, instead of trying 

to emulate a societal meta-

narrative. Let us rally behind 

female politicians as we move 

into 
the 
upcoming 
election 

cycle, not solely because they 

are women, but because they 

are individuals who deserve a 

candidacy without the white 

noise of subtle gender-based 

remarks and outfit critiques. 

Let 
us 
stand 
together 
and 

continue to contribute to the 

energizing wave of championing 

each other, instead of turning 

our backs.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 

established 
herself 
as 
an 

independent, 
strong-willed 

woman in the 1950s. Today, she 

sits on the bench of the highest 

court in the land. The fight 

that she represents is not over, 

but rather renewed. We find 

ourselves riding on this new 

momentum of outspokenness for 

women’s rights and recognition, 

but must take note as to how to 

best contribute to this. Let us 

be aware of this expected mold 

that media urges female leaders 

and personalities to be and 

implore others to break free of 

these restraints. I am strong in 

my own right, and it may not be 

because I am stubborn or need 

to prove my capabilities. And 

all of those around me equally 

share this strength, regardless 

of their qualities — we just need 

to get rid of the narrative trying 

to tell us otherwise.

On selective outrage

L

ast semester, I had to take 
Space 101: Rocket Science 
as a requirement for my 

minor in space engineering. I am 
majoring in engineering physics 
and computer science, so I went 
into the class with a relatively 
high level of comfort with the 
topics that would be discussed. 
On the first day of class, I quickly 
realized 
the 
course 
would 

satisfy the LSA natural science 
requirement and only required 
a working knowledge of algebra. 
Given the average historical 
grade was an A-, the lecture hall 
was packed with humanities and 
social science majors looking 
for a class that would satisfy the 
requirement and involve as little 
math as possible.

Was I a little frustrated most 

students had no interest in a 
subject near and dear to my 
heart? Yes. Do I think courses 
like Space 101 should be limited 
to engineering students? Of 
course not.

Intellectual 
breadth 

requirements 
vary 
for 
each 

major, but their purpose remains 
the same: to expose students to 
subjects and skills not taught in 
their major’s core curriculum. 
Those 
classes 
help 
make 

students 
more 
well-rounded 

and allow them to interact with 
students from whom they may 
not normally get to learn. For 
engineers, they can also serve a 
different purpose and teach us 
skills we may not learn in our 
structured, 
problem-solving 

based curriculum.

Engineers 
taking 
upper-

level humanities classes have 
frustrated 
engineers 
and 

LSA students alike, but the 
importance of this requirement 
can’t be overlooked. Generalizing 
the average engineering student 
as someone who only watches 
lecture recordings or has to 
submit all assignments to a harsh 
autograder (something only the 
Program in Computer Science 
employs, as far as I know) is 
stereotypical 
and 
somewhat 

demeaning to the entire college. 
Engineering students frequently 
are required to work in groups 
on projects, discuss the merits 
of 
various 
problem-solving 

techniques and teach each other 
material when office hours are 
busy. We aren’t all introverts 

who can’t communicate well 
enough to take a discussion-
based course. In fact, many 
required engineering courses 
also have required discussion 
sections, not to mention the 
other 13 liberal arts credits we 
have to take.

Engineering 
students 
are 

required to take a minimum of 
16 credits of liberal arts courses, 
which 
include 
humanities, 

professional development and 
intellectual breadth courses from 
a wide range of departments. 
Only three credits must be 
300-level or higher. Implying 
that engineering students are 
only required to take one non-
engineering course in the entire 
four years they spend at the 
University is flat-out wrong.

Admittedly, 
engineering 

degrees are often structured 
differently than social science 
or 
humanities 
degrees. 
To 

reach upper-level core classes 
in a subject, students must take 
several enforced prerequisites 
in a sequence to even be able to 
register. When looking at upper-
level humanities courses, almost 
none of the classes (taught in 
English) even have advisory 
prerequisites. This implies that 
these courses can be taken by 
any student, regardless of major 
or academic background. The 
difference between upper-level 
and introductory classes in the 
humanities is that the classes 
become 
more 
specialized. 

The classes still have the same 
structure of learning material 
during lectures and analyzing the 
content in discussion sections.

These 
discussion-based 

courses allow everyone to be on 
the same playing field. As there 
are no prerequisites, students 
who pay attention in class and 
learn the material should all be 
able to contribute. Engineers 
may 
have 
a 
disadvantage 

of 
being 
used 
to 
learning 

environments where there is 
only one correct answer, but 
there can be hundreds of ways 
to reach that answer and find a 
working solution. We do often 
have a different perspective 
from our LSA peers, with a 
relatively weaker background 
in humanities, but that doesn’t 
mean 
valuable 
contributions 

from engineering students “tend 

to be the exception, not the 
rule.” In fact, that statement is 
somewhat insulting.

To be fair, there are many 

engineering students who don’t 
have the same enthusiasm for 
humanities as they do for their 
major core classes. However, there 
are always going to be students 
who have no interest in the subject 
being taught. That subject just 
varies from person to person, 
major to major. I am sure many 
LSA students majoring in math or 
a science feel the same way about 
humanities. Should there be a 
limit on how many non-majors are 
allowed in a class? What about a 
limit on how many underclassmen 
take 
upper-level 
humanities? 

Both of those options would let 
upper-level humanities students 
enjoy their classes more, but I 
think that would end up hurting 
everyone. The whole purpose of 
a discussion is to have students 
analyze material and compare 
their insights with their peers. 
Nowhere does it say that every 
student in a 300-level philosophy 
class should have already read all 
of Kant and Nietzsche’s works in 
order to be able to “elevate” the 
class discussion.

So the main question here 

is this: Who gets to determine 
what contributions to a class-
wide discussion are valuable? 
Assuming 
the 
only 
valid 

contribution is something we 
would’ve thought of ourselves 
seems 
somewhat 
narrow 

minded. Some of the most 
interesting 
perspectives 
I’ve 

heard have come from people 
in other majors and other 
colleges. Isolating each major 
in their own echo chamber 
of 
students 
who 
take 
the 

same classes, learn the same 
information and are interested 
in the same things is not how 
college should work. We pursue 
higher education to learn about 
different things, to meet people 
from a variety of backgrounds 
and to discover new interests 
we may have never considered. 
Those are the things that create 
a positive, supportive learning 
environment.

When I think of A Tribe Called 
Quest, I think of my high school’s 
art room. I think of the overflowing 
cork board, pushpins doing their 
darndest to tack down exceptional 
student work and inspiration, with 
a cardstock square print of the Beats, 
Rhymes and Life cover hanging on for 
dear life at the top left corner. I think 
of playing “Oh My God” in the select, 
seniors-only space that was the back 
room (affectionately referred to as 
“the closet,” because it wasn’t much 
bigger) while we were painting the 
annual homecoming mural. I think 
of my classmate approaching me the 
next day, gushing about Midnight 
Marauders and asking for more 
music 
recommendations 
similar 
to it. I think about finally breaking 
down the façade of my too-cool-for-
school art teacher when he regaled 
the story of his first Tribe concert to 
me.
When Hanif Abdurraqib thinks 
of A Tribe Called Quest, he thinks of 
his father’s reverence for jazz, sour 
cherry candies he bought on a road 
trip and Tony, the bootleg “CD Man” 
in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio.
Abdurraqib thinks of a lot of 
things I have never thought of, 
but we are still united in the fact 
that when we think of A Tribe 
Called Quest, we think of a lot of 
thoughts. Both him and I are self-
described ATCQ fans, and while 
our backgrounds can’t be any more 
disparate — Black boy from urban 
Ohio who blossomed alongside the 
golden age of hip hop and white girl 
born and bred in varying suburbs 
who rediscovered that era as the 
internet made her more musically 
conscious — this strand of fandom 
has lassoed us together.
In “Go Ahead in the Rain,” 
Abdurraqib threads together all 
these thoughts using the keen needle 
that is A Tribe Called Quest.
The 
book’s 
function 
is 
multifaceted: 
a 
history, 
a 

commentary, a love letter, a memoir. 
It tracks the history of the Tribe 
from its inception to its final bow, 
supplemented with sketches of 
scenes from Abdurraqib’s own 
adolescence and grounded in the 
American landscape at any given 
moment. Take, for example, his 
situating of ACTQ’s sophomore 
album, The Low End Theory, in the 
context of the Rodney King riots: 
“Los Angeles wasn’t on fire yet when 
(Low End) was being made or when 
it was released. But it would be on fire 
by the time the songs were playing in 
heavy rotation across America … The 
constant replaying of the footage 
(of Rodney King’s beating) was 
laying a new groundwork for rage in 
communities miles away.” Low End 
is an album undercut by “righteous 
anger,” as Abdurraqib puts it, but in 
his exhaustive profile of the group, 
he never loses sight of the world 
they moved with, and the world that 
moved against them.
A Tribe Called Quest’s anger 
on The Low End Theory was more 
audibly weaponized by other groups 
defining the rap game in divergent 
ways, groups like Public Enemy 
or N.W.A. That same anger was 
channeled through Abdurraqib in 
a heart-wrenching anecdote where 
he punched his older brother, “not 
because I wanted to hurt him, but 
because I wanted him to imagine 
a world in which I was unafraid 
to 
hurt 
him.” 
This 
complex 
interconnectedness is indicative of 
how the book flows as a whole: For 
everything A Tribe Called Quest did, 
Abdurraqib has a story to tell.
And through the stories he tells 
us, they live on through stories of 
our own. In this regard the book 
is timeless. There is no Midnight 
Marauders without the legendary 
cover art, a veritable who’s who 
of rap in ’93. There is no Midnight 
Marauders without young music 
nerds like Abdurraqib, who would 
complement his listens to the record 
flipping the sleeve back and forth, 
trying to correctly identify everyone 
on the cover without peeking at the 

cheat sheet on the back. There is no 
Midnight Marauders if it doesn’t live 
on decades later, in an unlikely high 
school art room hundreds of miles 
away from Linden Boulevard in New 
York City.
This is not to say “Go Ahead 
in the Rain” falls into a formula. 
Abdurraqib does not spend the 
whole time laying out a concise 
compendium of the major players 
in late ’80s and early ’90s hip hop, 
nor does he spend the whole time 
talking about his childhood attempts 
to impress the 
cool kids on 
the bus rides 
to 
school 
with his ever-
expanding 
taste. 
He 
satisfyingly 
swirls all these 
parts into a 
simmering 
stew, 
meant 
for all to enjoy, 
from 
old 
to 
young, fan to 
critic. Its taste 
is irresistible.
No 
two 
people 
will 
have the same 
experience 
reading “Go Ahead in the Rain.” 
You might have never heard of A 
Tribe Called Quest before picking 
up the book, or you might be so 
well versed in hip hop history you 
felt Abdurraqib’s version of it was 
incomplete. No matter how you feel, 
Abdurraqib makes you think about 
your relation to the Tribe, however 
idiosyncratic it is. He uses ATCQ’s 
music as a springboard to uncover 
an unsure truth behind their impact, 
wonderfully juggling tons of golden 
nuggets of supplemental information 
while never losing sight of the task at 
hand. Abdurraqib asks a seemingly 
simple question — “Is there more 
to A Tribe Called Quest than their 
discography?” — only to stumble 
upon a wealth of answers.
Since I didn’t live alongside A 

Tribe Called Quest at their peak, 
my fandom is one primarily defined 
by wistful appreciation, delving 
critically into their catalog for the 
sake of my growth as a listener 
and a scholar. I was overjoyed that 
Abdurraqib introduced the mostly 
chronological framework of the book 
with a discussion of “Jazz (We’ve 
Got),” my absolute favorite Tribe 
song, and even mentioned a very 
specific line from the song, one that 
has stuck with him as much as it has 
stuck with me since my first listen 
years ago: “I 
don’t 
really 
mind if it’s over 
your head / 
Cause the job 
of resurrectors 
is to wake up 
the dead.” Yet 
I was slightly 
disappointed 
he didn’t have 
much to say 
about 
the 
actual music on 
their last and 
most 
recent 
album We Got 
It from Here... 
Thank You 4 
Your Service.
Much 
like 
Q-Tip’s bumbling road trip in the 
“I Left My Wallet In El Segundo” 
video and much like life, the book 
is a meandering odyssey, one with 
no clear end or beginning. It is 
loaded with references, stories and 
background information, but there is 
no semblance of a traditional music 
biography. The core communion 
between the artist, the listener and 
the world is the main narrative tool 
that binds all these moving parts 
together, but is perhaps only evident 
to those who actively synthesize 
their interest in the music with 
what they are reading on the page. 
How you feel if given an exit survey 
might directly depend on your level 
of familiarity with ACTQ.
However, it doesn’t matter if you 
feel “Go Ahead in the Rain” was 

encyclopedic or inadequate. What 
matters is that it makes you feel 
something, because the thing so 
damn captivating about the Tribe is 
their timeless capacity to touch us 
any listener. A common criticism of 
the group nowadays is that they are 
corny, that it’s rap for your parents. 
The irony is that this criticism has 
been thrown at them for their entire 
lifespan. I think that says a lot — A 
Tribe Called Quest might not be for 
you, but at least you tried to listen 
to them, you had a clear experience 
with them, be you mother, son, 
father or daughter.
Celebrity deaths don’t usually 
hit me hard, but the passing of 
Malik Izaak Taylor aka Phife Dawg 
challenged me in a way I was never 
familiar with. He was a core fixture 
of a group I immensely admired, 
but never associated with anything 
more than some damn good music 
— the same music that I got everyone 
bopping to in my high school art 
room. Back in my advanced art class 
senior year, we had free reign to 
take on any project. To make sense 
of Phife’s death, I decided my next 
endeavor would be a tribute, a dual 
portrait of Q-Tip and Phife united 
in brotherhood. But because of my 
misguided laziness and the reality 
that deadlines are a fickle mistress, 
I only ended up drawing Q-Tip solo, 
and my tribute felt hollow.
I have always found myself 
mesmerized by Q-Tip’s craft: I 
had never felt the betrayal that 
Abdurraqib felt when he learned 
Tip was the most responsible for 
Tribe’s inevitable break-up. On one 
of those late nights painstakingly 
sketching the countless strands of 
straw composing his hat, Thank 
You 4 Your Service dropped. I 
immediately bought it on iTunes 
(I know, something unheard of in 
today’s day and age of streaming). I 
needed to own this album: It wasn’t 
enough to just look it up on Spotify, 
a place where its continued existence 
is not fully guaranteed. The greatest 
impression I had after my first 
listen was that the album is a bridge 

between the past and future, life and 
death. To Hanif, who never “wanted 
another Tribe Called Quest album” 
before “Phife died,” “it was even 
greater than (he) could ever ask for.” 
To me, it was the old guard’s way of 
formally passing the torch to the rap 
I grew up with, those like “Joey, Earl, 
Kendrick and Cole,” as shouted out 
on “Dis Generation.”
If I had to describe “Go Ahead in 
the Rain” using only one Tribe song, 
it would be “Black Spasmodic,” a cut 
off the second half of Thank You 4 
Your Service. Tip’s verse on the song 
is very much trying to make sense 
of Phife’s death, using his words to 
summon Phife’s own spirit “through 
mixing chords and boards and even 
drum machines.” His verse ends:

“Live the Tribe principle of having 
impeccable taste

Enjoy that breath like that one was 
your last one left

If you don’t believe me, Tip, there’s 
truly life after death

So refer to the Biggie covers and 
shout out my Trini brothers

And please check in on my mother

Malik Izaak, call me shorty.”

It seems Malik’s death was 
the impetus for Abdurraqib to 
write “Go Ahead in the Rain,” his 
way of making sense of it. We are 
blessed with him giving the Tribe 
everything he could, acting a lovely 
curator and chronicler of all things 
A Tribe Called Quest. Abdurraqib 
reminds us that the soul of the group 
was always one to be shared, then 
and now, between Hanif and me, 
through speakers in art rooms and 
headphones on bus rides, to anyone 
willing to hear.

With ‘Go Ahead,’ Abdurraqib never loses sight of love

CASSANDRA MANSUETTI
Senior Arts Editor

Suspended on top of a metal 
ladder breaching into the ceiling 
of the Newman Studio at the 
Walgreen Drama Center, was 
Theatre and Drama professor, 
Tzveta Kassabova. “Can I just 
drop this tire first? Before the 
interview?” she called down 
to me. “Of course! Absolutely!” 
I 
exclaimed 
in 
response, 
excited to be witness to a bit 
of theatrical magic as a large 
tire fell from the darkness 
of the ceiling with a simple 
flick 
of 
a 
rope. 
Tzveta 
cheered in admiration at the 
contraption having worked, 
and went to hug her set 
designer Niki White. With 
less than a week left until the 
opening of the devised show 
“Murakami by the Sea,” the 
entire studio was buzzing 
with hands busy at work.
“And then I realized that 
the deep darkness inside 
me had vanished. Suddenly. 
As suddenly as it had come. 
I raised myself from the 
sand and, without bothering 
either to take off my shoes 
or roll up my cuffs, walked 
into the surf to let the waves 
lap at my ankles,” are the 
brilliant words of Haruki 
Murakami, 
a 
Japanese 
writer, whose short stories and 
novels have influenced people 
across the world. His writings 
are the foundation of the 
devised show “Murakami by 
the Sea.” Tzveta Kassabova, the 
director of the piece, speaks of 
the visceral feelings that can be 
found in specific moments such 
as the ones Murakami addresses 
in the above passage. “I find 
it beautiful that sometimes 
things happen in one moment. 
You 
don’t 
even 
necessarily 
know how it happened but 
you understand that singular 
moment, made everything very 
different.” In the rehearsal 
process, Kassabova has been 
working with the actors to 
create life-altering moments 
like these, on the stage. “A lot 

of it is setting circumstances 
so that something can happen,” 
she began, “It’s a blank slate 
starting from scratch. We all 
(the cast and crew) read the 
short stories and researched 
images 
that 
we 
then 
can 
create with. We started to play 
improvisational 
games, 
that 
set the structure for certain 
moments to occur. Nothing is 
forced in this, it just happens.”
A devised piece of theatre is 
a process of theatre creation in 
which the whole team: Actors, 
directors, designers, etc. are 

partaking in the development 
of 
the 
show. 
Sam 
Dubin, 
Sophomore BFA Acting major 
and an actor in “Murakami by 
the Sea,” explained what the 
rehearsal process was like for 
him: “We met a month before 
we started rehearsals and the 
entire cast and crew had dinner 
together and talked about our 
relationship to the text to begin 
with 
and 
our 
expectations 
with the text moving forward,” 
he explained. The rehearsal 
process of a devised piece is not 
the same rehearsal process of a 
scripted play. There are no lines 
given to actors to memorize 
at the beginning, no character 
objectives to configure. Actors 
create the story with the rest 
of the ensemble in the room, 

during the rehearsals.
While this can be creatively 
exciting, it can also be difficult. 
Dubin explains the difficulties 
he found during the process: 
“It’s no joke that this can be 
frustrating and most of the 
time things don’t make sense 
in our head,” says Dubin. “One 
thing our dramaturge (Teresa 
Kovacs) would say is that 
there’s a human need to want 
the questions to be answered. 
She told us that we should enjoy 
the questions we have and 
allow them to push us forward. 
Maybe we will find the 
answers, but in away 
our goal is to end 
this 
process 
with 
more 
questions. 
If 
you give an audience 
answers and you make 
it easier for them, 
it’s more likely that 
they’ll forget about it. 
Even if someone sees 
‘Murakami 
by 
the 
Sea’ and they don’t 
understand 
what’s 
going on, it’s more 
valuable 
to 
let 
an 
audience go and be able 
to confidently say that 
they’re questioning.”
Audience members 
are 
encouraged 
to 
enter into this show 
not expecting to find 
answers, but rather 
new ideas and queries about life 
to ruminate upon. “It becomes 
a part of you,” Dubin says of 
devising theatre. “You care 
about it, and you put so much 
of yourself into it, sometimes it 
can hurt you, in a way. Seeing it 
leave so quickly like that. It can 
hurt you.” After this February 
weekend, the actors will have 
left the stage. The set will be 
taken down, falling tire and all. 
The stage managers notes will 
be tucked away. But one thing 
will always remain: what was 
felt along the way. Moments 
found on the stage that provoke 
new emotions, new connections, 
new questions, provide the 
audience and creative team 
alike, an opportunity to leave 
the experience changed.

‘Go Ahead 
in the Rain: 
Notes to a 
Tribe Called 
Quest’

Hanif Abdurraqib

University of Texas Press

Feb. 2019

Throughout the performing 
arts, diversity initiatives are 
beginning to take on historical 
problems 
in 
representation 
— 
particularly 
regarding 
directors, 
choreographers, 
conductors 
and 
others 
important to and yet removed 
from 
the 
performance 
process. This past weekend, 
the 
Department 
of 
Dance 
demonstrated their dedication 
to diversity with “Complex 
Rhythms,” 
a 
multi-work 
performance featuring three 
works by women of color.
The evening spanned four 
works: “7 x 12 And A Little Bit 
of Cha-Cha,” “Studio A, will 
you die with me?,” “Prelude, 
Fugue, and Riffs” and “Shelter.” 
Two of the works, “7 x 12 And 
A Little Bit of Cha-Cha” and 
“Prelude, Fugue, and Riffs” 
were choreographed by SMTD 
professors; the other two were 
by guest artists.
The evening opened with 
Professor Robin Wilson’s “7 
x 12 And A Little Bit of Cha-
Cha,” featuring the music of 
Marwan Amen-Ra, Alina Moor 
and SMTD Lecturer of Jazz & 
Contemporary 
Improvisation, 
Marion 
Hayden. 
Though 
it began with singing and 
limited movement, the work 
quickly morphed into a vibrant, 
colorful display. The dancers 
wore simple costumes of bright 
and solid colors. The cast of 12 
traversed the stage from left 
to right, sometimes diverging 
into smaller groups and solo 
moments.
At one point, the ensemble 
began walking repeatedly across 
the stage. As they continued 
walking, their motions went 
from 
simple 
to 
expressive, 
elaborate to profound. Motions 
that once represented walking 
began to represent dance. This 
was my favorite moment of the 
work, the moment at which 
human aspects of the elaborate, 
eye-catching 
choreography 
became apparent to me.

The second work, “Studio 
A, will you die with me?,” was 
a solemn, thought-provoking 
meditation on race. As the 
choreographer described in the 
program, “‘Studio A, will you 
die with me?’ is a fire ritual that 
works to disrupt the anti-black, 
heteronormative and capitalist 
structures that live within the 
fabric of Western dance studios 
and dance curriculums.”
The work began with a long 
blue sheet being drawn across 
the front of the stage and giant 
metal racks with candles on 
them being placed in the back. 
This blue sheet was quickly 
covered in miniscule sparkling 
objects that I can only assume 
were 
stones. 
The 
dancers, 
wearing 
neutral 
grey/green 
clothing, moved slowly across 
the stage. After a little while, 
they put on sparkling masks 
that all but completely obscured 
the facial region.
This, combined with the 
dim lighting, made individual 
identities all but unidentifiable. 
And while one member of 
the ensemble performed an 
impressive 
and 
elaborate 
dance, the others moved slowly 
and deliberately, their lack of 
motion perhaps representing 
more than their motion.
The 
finish 
was 
truly 
unforgettable. 
The 
music 
ended, the cast pulled off 
their masks and the audience 
sat in rapt attention. As the 
ensemble cleaned up the cloth 
and wheeled off the candles, 
the audience sat in silence, 
processing 
the 
poignant, 
complex work that had just 
occurred.
The 
third 
work 
was 
“Prelude, Fugue, and Riffs” 
by Professor Bill DeYoung. It 
featured a recording of Leonard 
Bernstein’s “Prelude, Fugue, 
and Riffs” by the University 
Symphony Band conducted by 
Professor Michael Haithcock.
The set was magnificent, 
containing individual points 
of light and grey rectilinear 
shapes mimicking an urban 
skyline on a starry night. The 
dancing, much like the music, 

reflected big band jazz taken 
to a hectic, almost frenetic 
extreme. Piercing jazz lines and 
frantic blues riffs were matched 
with busy ensemble motions 
and energetic solo moments. 
The dancers’ stamina was on 
display, as they managed to 
maintain for ten minutes what 
few could for one minute.
After a short intermission, 

percussionist 
Marwan 

Amen-Ra 
returned 
to 
the 
stage accompanied this time 
by 
Professor 
(and 
in 
this 
instance 
narrator) 
Robin 
Wilson for Jawole Willa Jo 
Zillar’s 
“Shelter.” 
Wilson 
and 
Department 
of 
Dance 
Chair, Anita Gonzalez, were 
both part of the original 1988 
performance, a performance 
attended 
to 
address 
“the 
suffering 
and 
isolation 
of 
homelessness” 
according 
to 
dramaturge Efe Osagie, who is 
a Michigan in Color editor for 
The Daily. The work had been 
modified following Hurricane 
Katrina to address those made 
homeless as a result of this 
storm; this was the version of 
the work being presented.
The performance was simple, 
yet profound. As Wilson read 
simple poetry and prose, the 
percussionist and the dancers 
evoked the struggle of these 
people. It was mournful at 
times, violent at others. It built 
to great heights, with dancers 
convulsing on the ground as 
the 
percussion 
aggressively 
beat time. And it traversed 
considerable 
lengths, 
the 
deliberacy 
of 
motion 
never 
ebbing though the intensity 
waned.
Though it ostensibly lasted 
over twenty minutes, it was 
engaging to the point where I 
lost track of time. It was a fitting 
end to the night and a stunning 
testament to the works of those 
outside the traditional canon 
of Western dance, particularly 
women of color. It was both 
a reminder for the need to 
increase the diversity of the 
performing arts and an example 
of the amazing work being done 
by those within the canon.

Valentine’s Day is a day 
invented 
by 
the 
capitalist 
patriarchy to ensure single 
girls feel sad and alone one day 
a year. Well — news flash — we 
always feel sad and alone. I 
know it is tempting, but please, 
for the sake of humanity do not 
watch the movie “Valentine’s 
Day” this Valentine’s Day. On 
the surface it seems apropos, 
I mean the movie is basically 
instructing you when and how 
to watch it. When being on 
Valentine’s Day and how is by 
yourself and buried in Hershey 
Kisses wrappers. But really 
there is no good time to watch 
“Valentine’s Day” because it 
is the worst. It was the first 
and last time Taylor Swift was 
ever in a movie because “The 
Giver” does not count. But it 
was also how a) Taylor met 
Taylor (Lautner) and started 
their 
Taylor-filled 
Taylor-
multuous relationship and b) 
gave us the ballad that is “Back 
to December.”
Also, let’s just talk about how 
everyone is in this movie but 
no one is good. It’s like if you 
make pie and fill it with things 
that individually taste good, 
then mix them all together 
in a dough of weak plot and 
flimsy characters. It will taste 
like a Nicholas Cage movie. 
Yeah, I like cookie dough and 
I like chicken nuggets, but 
I would never put them in 

a pie together. Even if Julia 
Roberts and Bradley Cooper 
become plane friends in your 
pie or Anne Hathaway plays 
a phone-sex operator in your 
pie or Ashton Kutcher lovingly 
delivers flowers to women who 
are not Mila Kunis in your 

pie, it won’t make the pie taste 
good. And it certainly won’t 
encourage you to make another 
pie for another holiday (cough, 
cough “New Year’s Eve”). So, 
dear reader, here are some 
suggestions of things you can 
do this Valentine’s Day that 
doesn’t include watching the 
movie “Valentine’s Day.”
Poke your eyes out with a 
Command hook. Then reapply 
the Command hook to the wall 
for its purpose of holding your 
bathrobe.
Watch 
sports. 
They’re 
literally always on.
Experiment with Satanism.
Create a dating app for dogs.

Write 
the 
next 
great 
American novel. Like it’s hard?
Become an ASMR YouTube 
sensation.
Date Noah Centineo and have 
a very public, very dramatic 
breakup. 
Organize your desktop.
Text 
your 
crush 
a 
questionably suggestive meme.
Discover a deadly species of 
spider and name it after your ex.
Drink blood.
Ask your parents if you were 
an accident.
Start communicating only 
via carrier pigeon.
Find your long lost twin at 
summer camp and switch places 
to mess with Dennis Quaid.
Look up pictures of Dennis 
Quaid. He has still got it
Watch all 275 episodes of 
“Cheers.”
Contemplate the existence of 
an afterlife.
Create a shrine to Adam 
Driver in your closet. But you 
should do this anyways.
Pose nude for an art class 
filled with your crushes.
Do stand-up comedy.
Replace all the faces in the 
Vatican with Chrissy Teigen 
grimacing at the 2016 Oscar’s. 
Befriend a quirky inventor, 
witness his murder and then 
travel back in time to ensure 
that your parents boink.
Fuck 
it, 
just 
watch 
“Valentine’s Day.”

What to do on Valentine’s 
Day: Don’t watch the film

DAILY HUMOR COLUMN

BECKY 
PORTMAN

Middle school is the apex of 
discomfort. It is three years 
of 
magnified 
displeasure 
and embarrassment, most of 
which 
are 
psychologically 
repressed and buried deep 
within our psyche — which 
makes it all the more baffling 
that someone would not only 
suggest to revisit it, but also 
magnify how uncomfortable it 
is. Whatever their reasoning, 
they managed to convince a 
few other unfortunate souls. 
The terrifying, disturbing and 
depressing result is “PEN15.”
The 
show 
follows 
two 
friends, Maya (Maya Erskine, 
“Betas”) 
and 
Anna 
(Anna 
Konkle, 
“Rosewood”), 
as 
they start the seventh grade 
together. The catch? Maya 
and Anna are played by adults, 
while the rest of the cast 
are acutal children (because 

that 
won’t 
make 
anyone 
uncomfortable, right?). The 
premiere, “First Day,” shows 
their disastrous first day. The 
school lockers are plastered 
with “Dustin hearts Maya” 
and “Brandt hearts Maya” 
written on notebook paper. 
While Maya is at first lured 
into 
believing 
these 
boys 
“like-like” her, she is duped 
by the wicked popular kids, 
who christen her that year’s 
UGIS 
— 
the 
Ugliest 
Girl 
In School. In the end, she 
challenges 
Brandt 
(Jonah 
Beres, “Strange Nature”) to 
a trash-talking competition, 
where she almost stands up 
for herself. In the end, she 
claims 
his 
uncircumcised 
penis is the reason why his 
dad died. Yikes.
For a comedy about the 
struggle 
of 
navigating 
pubescent politics, “PEN15” 
cannot even muster a chuckle. 
Most of the jokes operate off 
of Erskine and Konkle’s air-
headed characters. However, 
their acting is so insufferable 
— their voices so irritating — 
that all the jokes land closer 
to the side of pity than humor. 
It really is embarrassing to 
watch these two suspiciously 
youthful-looking 
women 
attempt to imitate middle 
schoolers. Their classmates — 
who are all played by children 
— are just as bad at acting. At 
least they have an excuse.
Which brings me to the 
dynamic Erskine and Konkle 
share with their co-stars. One 
stereotype of middle school 
the show nails is the flirting 
and 
note-passing 
occuring 
between children who are 
beginning to understand their 
sexualities. “PEN15” does not 
shy away from incorporating 
the 
strange 
way 
children 
attempt to interact with one 
another. But, adult actors in 
their 30s flirting with child 
actors is simply unpleasant. 
As child-like as Erskine and 
Konkle might seem, they still 
visibly look like adults, braces 
or not.
For as much as the show 

lacks 
direction 
or 
humor, 
it 
also 
lacks 
conscience. 
The 
aforementioned 
scene 
wherein 
Maya 
says 
that 
Brandt’s 
uncircumcised 
penis is the reason why his 
dad died stands out for how 
uncomfortably 
shocking 
it 
was. Even worse, Maya suffers 
absolutely zero consequences 
for this. Brandt cries. Maya 
runs away. Then the next 
night, when Maya asks Anna 
if she was being too harsh, 
Anna asserts that no, she was 
not. Instead, Maya gets to 
erase her name off the UGIS 
list in the boys bathroom for a 
triumphant win.
If there’s anything “PEN15” 
does well, it’s capture the 
atmosphere of middle school. 
The 
awkward 
clothing 
choices, 
the 
uncertainty 
about bras, passing notes and 
the strange way tweens and 
pre-teens talk to each other 
are 
all 
expertly 
captured 
here. Even the soundtrack 
is full of 2000s alt-classics. 
But “PEN15” also emulates 
the reason we’d like to forget 
middle school ever existed. 
The show is uncomfortable, 
disturbing 
and 
unsettling. 
The 
two 
lead 
actresses 
are so almost like middle 
schoolers — and yet so far 
— that it errs too close into 
the territory of the uncanny 
valley. If it was at least funny, 
there might be something to 
spare. But it isn’t. Instead, 
“PEN15” belongs in the land 
of psychologically repressed 
memories, never to resurface.

Not 
all 
movies 
need 
sequels. Movies whose entire 
premises are based around 
huge twists really don’t need 
sequels. It’s a shame then 
that 2014’s “The Lego Movie” 
simply made too much money 
to condemn it to only child 
status. “The Lego Movie 2: 
The Second Part” attempts 
to live up to the high bar set 
by the original, but stumbles 
mightily along the way.
Picking up right where the 
first film left off, returning 
writers 
Phil 
Lord 
and 
Christopher Miller (“Spider-
Man: Into the Spider-Verse”) 
waste no time at all dropping 
the audience right back into 
the world of normal-special 
guy Emmet and his various 
LEGO-based 
friends. 
The 
animation is still brisk and 
colorful. The characters are 
still funny and charming. 
The ending is arguably just 
as emotionally resonant as 
the first film’s. And yet, 
despite all of that, something 
never quite feels right with 
this second chapter of the 
brick-based film franchise. 
Maybe it’s the fact that a 
huge part of what the first 
film so successful was the 
shocking originality of it. 
When the original “Lego 
Movie” was first announced 
it was assumed it would 
be nothing more than a 90 
minute commercial for toys, 
and while it was that to a 
degree, it was also a well-
told story about creativity, 
fathers and sons and the pain 
of growing up. “The Lego 
Movie 2” goes all-in on the 
meta 
fourth-wall-breaking 
twist that defined the ending 
of “The Lego Movie.” But, 

you can’t do the same gag 
twice, and the film feels half 
baked and empty because of 
it.
The plot is extraordinarily 
simple, even for a kids movie. 
After his friends are captured 
by the seemingly evil aliens 
of the “Systar System” Chris 
Pratt’s dweeby Emmet must 
team up with a parody of 

Chris Pratt’s more recent 
action 
hero 
characters 
(such 
as 
Star-Lord 
of 
“Guardians of the Galaxy”) 
in order to rescue them 
before 
“Ourmomageddon” 
is unleashed. The villain of 
the first film was the father. 
It’s not hard to see where 
“The Lego Movie 2” is going. 
Unlike the first movie, the 
writers never appear to be 
exactly keeping their cards 
close to their chest. The main 
plot drags on and on, with 
none of the main characters 
seeming to have quite enough 
to do. Wyldstyle (Elizabeth 

Banks, 
“Pitch 
Perfect 
3”), Batman (Will Arnett, 
“Arrested 
Development”) 
and Emmet’s other friends 
spend most of the movie 
trapped 
in 
the 
Systar 
System 
without 
anything 
interesting to do. Emmet 
himself 
mostly 
meanders 
around the LEGO cosmic 
universe without much of an 
urgency to his actions or a 
clear path to achieving his 
goal. The gag of Chris Pratt 
playing different versions 
of himself is funny at first 
but 
wears 
thin 
quickly, 
and like the other third act 
twists, its denouncement is 
predictable. 
Musical numbers abound, 
much more so than were 
previously present. While 
these 
numbers 
are 
all 
fairly interesting in and of 
themselves, they stop the 
narrative 
completely 
in 
its tracks. The film never 
totally justifies its decision 
to become a half-musical, 
and although there is a 
reason for it in-story, it’s 
an open question whether 
this particular LEGO movie 
might have been better off 
if they had just gone all the 
way with it and made “The 
Lego Movie: The Musical.” 
As it stands, this second 
Lego movies that we do have 
accurately reflects with it 
is like for children to play 
with Lego, because the story 
comes across as though it 
was 
completely 
made 
up 
as its writers went along. 
Thematically it doesn’t tie 
together nearly as well as the 
original “Lego Movie” and 
many characters feel lost in 
the shuffle. The potential 
and enormity of the world 
that existed in “The Lego 
Movie” is gone. The spark is 
dead: onto the next one.

To be successful, Michigan 
baseball needs to be consistent

Last season, the Michigan 
baseball team got off to a horrid 
4-11 start.
It lost a three-game series to 
Lipscomb — which had just a 
.444 win percentage last season. 
The Wolverines were outscored 
by an average of 1.2 runs and 
posted a batting average of 
.230 
while 
their 
opponents 
maintained an average of .255.
Michigan 
had 
its 
worst 
moment, though, in its home 
opener, when they lost 8-3 to 
Lawrence Tech, an NAIA school 
that lost its final game by a score 
of 28-0 to the Indiana Institute 
of Technology.
Yet, after that 8-3 loss to the 
Blue Devils, the Wolverines won 
their next 20 games, outscoring 
opponents by an average of 5 
runs.
During 
that 
win 
streak, 
Michigan found itself. Posting a 
team batting average of .317, their 
defense also found their groove. 
Its pitchers held opposing hitters 
to a .197 batting average and the 
team averaged 1.05 errors per 
game — at one point going four 
straight games without an error.
“Just the consistency of the 
approach and the mindset,” said 
Wolverines coach Erik Bakich. 
“It’s one thing to get up for Big 
Ten play, it’s one thing to be able 
to have a lot of energy when the 
team is winning or has the lead 
in the game. It’s another to be 
able to bring it to training days, 
to be able to take care of the little 
things, keeping the locker room 
clean, going into the weight room 
and really getting after it and 
just competing in everything.”
Then Michigan lost and kept 
losing. The Wolverines ended 
the season having won only one 
of their last six regular season 
games. 
Michigan’s 
batting 
average dropped to .205, while 
its opponents managed a .251 

average, eventually leading to 
the Wolverines being outscored 
35-16.
The 
slump 
couldn’t 
have 
come at a worse time, as they 
quickly crashed out of the Big 
Ten tournament after three 
days, only winning one game: a 
tournament opening 2-1 victory 
over Iowa.
Last year, most of the core 
players on the rollercoaster team 
were underclassmen, having lost 
11 juniors to the MLB draft in the 
previous offseason. This year, 
the team returns eight defensive 
starters and 10 pitchers, as 
well as most of its offensive 
production.
“I see a group of kids who’ve 
had another birthday, who’ve 
gotten stronger, who’ve become 
more physical,” Bakich said. 
“So I would like to think we’re 
capable of hitting for more power 
this year and I like to think some 
of our pitchers are going to be 
stronger, more durable. We’ve 
seen some bumps in velocity 
from some of our pitchers, and 

they look more physical on the 
mound as well.”
Stronger hitters and more 
durable pitchers will benefit this 
team, but if Michigan wishes to 
make as far of a run as its talent 
allows, it’ll also need to learn 
how to lessen the slumps and 
stay consistent.
“I think this group has a lot 
of potential,” said Bakich. “On 
paper, at least, the pieces are 
there to have a special, magical 
type of season. We’ve got our 
goals set as high as you can set 
them, and in terms of how we’ve 
prepared and being around these 
guys every day, it feels like a 
championship team.”
This season, the growth of 
their breakout freshmen and 
sophomores will need to not 
only come physically, but also 
mentally. If they can translate 
their experience from last year 
into taming the waves they go 
through, and finding a way to 
get hot towards the end of the 
season, perhaps the team can 
meet Bakich’s lofty expectations.

Dilk still working through injury

The 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball team finally has some 
momentum it desperately needed.
Sunday’s win over Penn State 
was the team’s fourth-straight 
win and its second conference 
victory on the road. Prior to their 
victory over the Nittany Lions, 
the Wolverines (7-6 Big Ten, 16-9 
overall) lost six out of nine games. 
So, things are trending up.
There 
is 
one 
significant 
concern, though. Last Thursday, 
during the first quarter against 
Nebraska, freshman guard Amy 
Dilk went down with a right knee 
injury while attempting a floater. 
She hasn’t played since, and 
the status of her injury remains 
uncertain. In high school, she 
injured the same knee twice and 
had surgery.
“She has a knee injury and 
she’s day-to-day right now,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico on Tuesday. “So, she’s out 
until she is back 100 percent.”
From the moment the season 
started, Dilk has been the main 
starter at point 
guard. She logged 
27 
minutes 
in 
each of the first 
four 
contests 
and 
quickly 
transitioned 
to 
the pace of the 
college 
game. 
Since the new 
calendar year, she 
is averaging close 
to 36 minutes per 
night.
When healthy, Dilk is a key 
asset to the Wolverines’ offense. 
She scores 7.6 points per game 
and has strong court vision that 
creates opportunities for her 
teammates.
Though Michigan won its 
two games without Dilk, her 
absence had a clear impact on its 
ball handling abilities. Michigan 
committed 21 turnovers against 
the Cornhuskers — its most in 
a game since late December. 

Early against the Nittany Lions, 
the Wolverines lacked direction 
again. They had a shaky start and 
picked up 22 turnovers — 13 of 
which came in the first half.
“To try to adjust without your 
point guard took a little bit of time 
in the last two 
games,” 
Barnes 
Arico said. “The 
problem is at this 
point of year, we 
don’t have too 
many 
practices 
to start working 
on 
developing 
another 
point 
guard. But at least 
we have the next 
couple days to 
really get people 
ready to be in that position.”
In the Penn State game, 
sophomore guard Deja Church, 
junior guard Akienreh Johnson 
and senior guard Nicole Munger 
shared most of the time running 
the offense. Barnes Arico plans to 
keep a rotation going — potentially 
giving freshman guard Danielle 
Rauch more reps, too — but looks 
to Church as the starter.
“I think for each of them, 
they’re willing to take on that 

role. But the responsibility of 
doing it 100 percent of the time 
is enormous,” Barnes Arico said. 
“And I think at this point in the 
season, for the best interest of our 
team it’s great to have different 
people there throughout the 
game.
“And Deja obviously is gonna 
be the first one there, and I think 
she has the most experience there 
and I think she can definitely 
handle that role and I think she 
embraces that role.”
Michigan’s 
three 
main 
options 
all 
bring 
something 
different to the table. As the 
veteran of the group, Munger is 
the most fundamentally sound. 
Her experience can help avoid 
mistakes in crunch time. Church 
is quick and excels at attacking 
the 
basket. 
Johnson 
brings 
size and hit her stride recently, 
scoring in double-figures twice 
this month.
Regardless, 
time 
will 
tell 
how well those characteristics 
compensate for Dilk’s absence.
“I can’t wait for (Dilk) to get 
back,” Barnes Arico said.
The Wolverines though, have 
managed — at least in the short 
term — without her.

‘M’ bounces back from lone loss

It wasn’t the most difficult 
matchup of the season, but it 
did provide the No. 4 Michigan 
wrestling team (10-1 overall, 
6-1 Big Ten) an important 
opportunity. Coming off their 
first loss of the season at top-
ranked Penn State, it was time 
to see if the Wolverines could 
process a loss and respond. 
As 
Drew 
Mattin 
reminded 
everyone, they absolutely can.
By pinning Matthew Vinci 
at 4:04 into the match, the 
sophomore brought Michigan 
back to its winning ways in 
the 
team’s 
return 
to 
Cliff 
Keen Arena. The fall gave the 
Wolverines a lead they would 
never relinquish and Michigan 
shook off its first loss of the 
season, beating Northwestern 
(3-10 overall, 1-7 Big Ten) by the 
score of 30-9. The commanding 
win saw the Wolverines drop 
three matches — all by decision 
— while the seven victories 
included two decisions, three 
major decisions and two falls.
Prior 
to 
Mattin’s 
match, 
the dual got off to an eventful 
start 
as 
freshman 
Mason 
Parris wrestled the Wildcats’ 
Conan Jennings. Down 5-2 to 
start the match’s final period, 
Parris escaped from the bottom 
position 
quickly 
to 
narrow 
the deficit to two points. An 
aggressive late push by Parris 
tied the match at five with 20 
seconds 
remaining, 
eliciting 

a roar from the packed Cliff 
Keen Arena crowd. It wouldn’t 
be enough, as Jennings earned 
a point from an escape and 
Parris’ late attempt at another 
takedown 
was 
unsuccessful 
upon video review.
In 
the 
133-pound 
class, 
Northwestern’s 
Sebastian 
Rivera was bumped up from 
the 
125-pound 
category 
to 
compete 
with 
redshirt 
junior 
Stevan 
Micic. 
Both 
wrestlers 
are ranked atop 
their 
respective 
weight 
classes, 
and Rivera was 
bumped 
up 
moments 
before 
the match. But 
Micic had little 
trouble scoring and wrestled to 
a 10-4 decision regardless.
“I didn’t really get to have 
a reaction (to the change in 
opponent). I was already on the 
mat,” Micic said. “I literally 
just turned around and shook 
his hand and wrestled. I treat 
every opponent the same way. 
Obviously you’ve gotta have 
some game plan, a little, but 
it’s hard, and you’re going 
to have to stick to your own 
way of wrestling. That’s most 
important.”
Redshirt sophomore Kanen 
Storr followed Micic with a win 
by major decision to extend the 
Michigan lead to 13-3, but the 
Wolverines’ 
momentum 
was 

halted by Shayne Oster’s decision 
victory over fifth-year senior 
Malik Amine. Coming out of the 
intermission, Michigan’s lead 
decreased when Alec Pantaleo 
lost to Ryan Deakin. The loss 
would be the Wolverines’ last 
and the Wildcats’ score never 
rose above nine, as redshirt 
junior Logan Massa promptly 
won by major 
decision. 
Michigan never 
looked 
back 
en route to its 
victory.
In a meet full 
of 
impressive 
performances, 
though, 
sophomore 
Reece Hughes’ 
stands 
out 
among the rest. 
Wrestling above his weight, 
Hughes needed only 1:18 to 
earn six points and then pin 
his opponent to earn a fall. The 
Wolverines’ score subsequently 
vaulted 
to 
a 
seemingly 
insurmountable 23-9 margin.
“When you’re going up (in 
weight), the pace tends to be a 
little bit slower, so I can keep the 
pace higher for longer,” Hughes 
said. “Usually with bumping up, 
like I’ve done a few times this 
year, I have to wear down the 
dude a little bit more, but this 
time I got in, I got a smooth shot, 
and I could finish quick, and 
then just went to work on top.”
Redshirt 
freshman 
Jelani 
Embree and redshirt junior 
Jackson Striggow closed out 
the dual with a major decision 
and a decision, respectively. 
The four consecutive victories 
— including two major decisions 
and a pin — to finish the dual 
meet was a dominant end to 
a dominant performance by 
Michigan.
“We were a little concerned 
coming off two weekends — 
really big opponents, really big 
arenas — that guys might not 
have their intensity as high as 
they need it (today),” said coach 
Sean Bormet. “So we talked 
about that during the week and 
I think overall they did a good 
job and responded really well.”

Wolverines face questions on offense

On Tuesday, the No. 17 
Michigan softball team spent 
most of practice doing one drill: 
batting with the bases loaded.
The Wolverines’ struggled 
against 
the 
nation’s 
elite, 
putting up a total of one run 
against then-No. 5 Florida and 
then-No. 7 Arizona while failing 
to drive baserunners home for 
much of the weekend.
“The only question we asked 
them after the Florida game 
was, ‘What do you think people 
say when they watch you play?’ 
” said Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins. “One of the words 
that came out of everybody’s 
mouth was timid. Well, timid 
is not really a good quality, you 
know, in a playing surface.”
Added freshman outfielder 
Lexie Blair, “I feel like our first 
few games we were a bit tense 
up at the plate. We were just 
trying too hard, we’re thinking 
too much. And then I would 
say after the Florida game, our 
coach was just telling us to not 
think, swing with intent. We’ve 
been playing for such a long 
time, we know what we’re doing 
when we go out into the box.”
By its last two games, the 

Wolverines’ offense broke out 
of its cage, lighting up South 
Florida and Illinois State for 10 
and 11 runs, respectively. But 
this resurgence very well could 
have been the result of playing 
unranked competition.
“(Playing against top-ranked 
teams) is something you can’t 
let get to your head,” said junior 
outfielder Haley Hoogenraad. 
“And I think, personally, it did 
at times, but I caught myself.”
But if Michigan has any 
hopes of being one of the best 
teams in the nation, it will need 
to replicate those performing 
against the likes of Florida and 
Arizona.
Opening weekend also raised 
some positional questions for 
Hutchins, who still isn’t sure 
what to expect and who to rely 
on offensively.
One 
of 
those 
glaring 
questions is who will play first 
base as the season progresses. 
Sophomore 
Taylor 
Bump 
started the first three games 
before senior Alex Sobczak got 
the nod against South Florida 
and Illinois State, but neither 
seemed to outperform the other 
at the plate. Hutchins, though, 
wants answers now, which 
means she will continue to 
experiment until she finds the 

perfect fit.
“First 
base 
is 
a 
hitting 
position, we all know, but you 
gotta be able to take care of the 
defense,” Hutchins said. “We 
gotta find a place for our best 
hitters. And first of all, I gotta 
figure out who the best hitters 
are.”
With 
the 
Big 
Ten/ACC 
challenge 
coming 
up 
and 
more 
top-10 
nonconference 
opponents 
to 
follow, 
the 
Wolverines 
will 
continue 
to 
be 
challenged. 
And 
if 
performances like those against 
Arizona and Florida occur again 
– when the lineup struggled to 
produce offense – it could raise 
bigger concerns for Michigan.
Chief 
among 
those 
is 
whether the team has enough 
power to hang with the best of 
the best. With senior catcher 
Katie Alexander hitting the 
only Wolverine home runs this 
past weekend, Hutchins hopes 
to find that power throughout 
the rest of the lineup. This 
could possibly mean playing 
one of the catchers at first base 
or Hutchins could try freshman 
infielder Morgan Overaitis who 
went 3-for-9 with three RBIs as 
a designated hitter.
For now, though, she’ll just 
have to wait and watch.

State College stunner

Beilein ejected for first time at Michigan, frustrations spill over in ugly upset loss at Penn State, 75-69

No luck

Michigan surrenders early flurry of goals, falls to 15th-ranked Fighting Irish in South Bend, 5-2

STATE COLLEGE — The 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team ran out of the tunnel, but 
this time John Beilein did not 
join them.
Near 
the 
end 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ worst half of the 
season, Zavier Simpson fell, the 
recipient of a hard screen from 
Penn State’s Jamari Wheeler. 
Rasir Bolton, who Simpson had 
been guarding, easily flipped in 
a runner as time expired.
The Nittany Lions led, 40-27, 
and Beilein was fed up. Fed up 
with poor shooting. Fed up 
with sloppy ball control. Fed up 
with lackluster defense. And in 
this moment, fed up with the 
officials.
He shouted towards them 
and was hit with a technical 
foul in response. Then another.
For just the second time in 
his 41-year coaching career, 
Beilein was ejected.
One half after losing its head 
coach, Michigan lost its third 
game of the season — falling, 
75-69, to Penn State (2-11 Big 
Ten, 9-15 overall).
“There will be some pretty 
interesting 
discussions 
with 
the Big Ten office,” Beilein said. 
“But what I will say is, you guys 
know I don’t get upset with 
officials.”
Beilein’s rare frustration was 
the culmination of 20 minutes 
of malaise for the sixth-ranked 
Wolverines 
(11-3, 
22-3). 
It 
began when Wheeler caught 
the opening tip-off, raced to 
the basket, and laid in the first 
points of the night. Six minutes 
later, Lamar Stevens muscled 
home an and-one to put the 
Nittany Lions up, 17-9.
Stevens, 
the 
Big 
Ten’s 
second-leading 
scorer, 
was 
a menace, scoring with ease 
inside. Playing as a small-ball 

‘5’, Stevens consistently beat 
the bigger Jon Teske, normally 
one of the nation’s best post 
defenders, to the tune of 26 
points.
The Wolverines often go as 
their point guard goes, and 
for Simpson, it was a night to 
forget. Like many of Michigan’s 
opponents have done, Penn 
State sagged off the junior and 
dared him to beat them from 
outside. He couldn’t, missing all 
four of his first-half attempts.
Simpson’s decision-making, 
meanwhile, was at its worst. 
He had six turnovers, his errant 
passes often sailing deep into the 
stands. It wasn’t just Simpson 
— before Beilein’s ejection, the 
picture of the Wolverines’ first 
half was Charles Matthews, 
arms outstretched, exasperated 
at sophomore guard Eli Brooks 
for being out of position to 
collect a pass.
“Credit Penn State,” Beilein 
said. “They got us out of sync. 
They’ve gone to more of a 
downhill attack, they’re more 
of an isolation team, they just 
isolate, isolate, isolate. And 
at the other end, their press, 
they can turn you over, and the 
switching of every ball screen 
was brilliant.”
With 
assistant 
Saddi 
Washington 
taking 
over 
the head coaching duties at 
halftime, the Wolverines fought 
their way back. Eight minutes 
into the half, they went on a 12-2 
run to cut their deficit to five, 
capped off with a Matthews 
turnaround in the lane.
Matthews did all he could, 
mixing three treys with his 
usual repertoire of mid-range 
jumpers 
to 
keep 
Michigan 
in 
striking 
distance. 
He 
scored 24 points on 8-for-11 
shooting, looking very much 
like the player who willed 
the Wolverines to a win over 
Wisconsin last Saturday. After a 

Nittany Lion spurt, he splashed 
a 3-pointer with a hand in his 
face, making the score 60-54 
with five minutes left.
But Stevens kept Michigan 
at bay by swatting away two 
transition layups in a row, and 
with 
3:19 
remaining, 
Mike 
Watkins placed the dagger with 
a turnaround over Teske. From 
there, the Nittany Lions salted 
away the upset at the foul line.
“They punked us,” Matthews 
said. “They punked us. Simple 
as that. They outrebounded 
us by 10. Twelve offensive 
rebounds — you’re not winning 
a game giving a team 12 
offensive rebounds.”
For the Nittany Lions, it was 
the high point in a down season. 
For the Wolverines, it was the 
third time they trudged away 
as euphoric students rushed the 
court.
But this time — from a once-
in-a-blue-moon 
ejection, 
to 
being handled by a conference 
bottom-dweller — was by far 
the most unexpected.

SOUTH BEND — Just 27 
seconds into the Michigan hockey 
team’s game at No. 15 Notre Dame 
(15-10-3 overall, 8-8-2-2 Big Ten), 
junior forward Will Lockwood 
was sent to the penalty box for 
interference.
One minute and 44 seconds 
later, forward Dylan Malmquist 
fired a shot from the right circle 
that went over junior goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne’s shoulder. After 
taking a penalty so early in the 
game, the Wolverines (12-12-6, 
8-8-4-2) found themselves in a 
hole they couldn’t climb out of.
“We 
took 
penalties 
that 
weren’t saving goals or protecting 
teammates,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “They were selfish. 
You can’t do that on the road 
against a good team.”
The Fighting Irish added two 
goals in under a minute in the 
second period to put the game 
firmly out of reach for Michigan, 
who lost, 5-2.
At the end of the first period, 
the Wolverines trailed by two 
goals but appeared to be close to 
cutting into Notre Dame’s lead. 
Shots on goal favored the Fighting 
Irish, 8-7, but Michigan’s chances 
were good looks that goaltender 
Cale Morris — who ranks 11th in 
the nation in save percentage — 
was able to stop.
The Wolverines killed off a 
penalty that carried over from the 
opening stanza to start the second 
period and from there took control 
of the game for a few minutes. 
They 
generated 
breakaway 
chances, worked to keep the puck 
in the offensive zone and put 
pressure on Morris.
Despite 
that 
pressure, 
it 
wasn’t until Lockwood picked 
up the puck at center ice that 
Michigan had a ‘Grade-A’ scoring 
opportunity. Lockwood weaved 
his way through three defenders 
from the neutral zone and found 
himself all alone in front of Morris.
Lockwood waited until Morris 
bit before releasing his shot. The 
puck bounced off one of the posts 

and into the net. For a moment, 
the Wolverines were firmly within 
striking distance. 
“They were going for a line 
change 
and 
it 
was 
delayed 
offsides,” 
Lockwood 
said. 
“I 
think (senior defenseman Joseph 
Cecconi) was just screaming to 
get up as fast as I can. Saw a lane, 
I think there was a pick at the 
blueline or something. Two guys 
ran into each other. Fortunately 
enough, kinda just went down (on) 
a breakaway.”
But 50 seconds later, forward 
Jake Pivonka fired a shot through 
the legs of senior defenseman 
Nicholas Boka that found twine 
behind Lavigne.
And under a minute after that, 
forward Michael Graham scored 
off a faceoff win for Notre Dame.
“It’s 
pretty 
devastating,” 
Lockwood said. “We’ve gotta 
learn to find momentum when it’s 
not there. That’s something we 
gotta work on.”
The game that appeared to be 
in reach for Michigan suddenly 
wasn’t, trailing 4-1 entering the 
third period.
The Wolverines had a chance 
to cut into Notre Dame’s lead 
with about 10 minutes to go in the 
final period when Cecconi sent 
the puck in from the blueline. It 
ended up loose in the crease and 
Morris had moved to the outside 
— there was a wide-open net for 
Michigan. But there wasn’t a 
Wolverine in the area to clean up 
the rebound, and Michigan’s best 
chance of the period to that point 
was neutralized. 
From there, the Wolverines lost 
their composure.
Cecconi — Michigan’s captain 
— took two penalties in the final 
stanza and seconds after he left 
the box, sophomore defenseman 
Quinn Hughes slashed a Notre 
Dame player.
“Disappointed 
(with 
the 
penalties), especially from our 
leaders,” Pearson said. “You can’t 
do that. Things aren’t going to go 
your way and you have to maintain 
your focus. You have to continue 
to play for the team and you can’t 
take things personally in your own 

end.”
While on the penalty kill, 
freshman forward Garrett Van 
Wyhe picked up a loose puck at 
the blueline. Defenseman Bobby 
Nardella slipped and fell trying to 
stop Van Wyhe from having a one-
on-none breakaway and Van Wyhe 
buried a shot five-hole on Morris. 
But on the very next shift, Notre 
Dame came back down the ice and 
tallied its second power-play goal 
of the game. Just when Michigan 
had hope, the Fighting Irish once 
again eliminated that hope within 
just a few seconds. 
“Disappointed just (with) how 
things unraveled in the third 
period,” Pearson said. “We lost our 
cool. We lost our composure. We 
lost our discipline and you can’t do 
that. Things aren’t gonna go your 
way each and every night. You’re 
gonna have some adversity and its 
how you deal with it.”
After earning their first sweep 
of the Big Ten season last weekend, 
the Wolverines certainly found 
adversity in South Bend. And with 
just four regular season games left, 
Michigan may run out of time to 
learn to deal with that adversity.

SOUTH BEND — On the 
penalty kill, a shot. On the power 
play, a shot. On even-strength, a 
shot.
No 
matter 
if 
it 
played 
with 
a 
man-advantage, 
man 
disadvantage or at even strength, 
the 
Michigan 
hockey 
team 
couldn’t prevent Notre Dame from 
getting a shot off. And five times, 
Hayden Lavigne couldn’t prevent 
those shots from becoming a goal.
The junior goaltender saw 23 
shots at him in a 5-2 loss. He saved 
just 19 for a save percentage of .826.
The first shot Lavigne faced set 
the tone for the night. On a power 
play mere seconds into the game, 
the Fighting Irish relentlessly 
pursued an early lead. They were 
met with airtight defense from 
the Wolverines that prevented 
any shots until the penalty neared 
a close. The first shot Michigan 
allowed — a slapshot from the 
faceoff point — found the back of 
the net.
Looking for an answer, the 
Wolverines saw their chance 

to retaliate when Notre Dame’s 
forward Mike O’Leary was called 
for high-sticking.
Michigan, though, failed to 
exploit the one-man advantage. 
Freshman 
defenseman 
Jack 
Summers couldn’t contain a pass 
to the blue line, which leaked for 
a Notre Dame breakaway. The 
Fighting 
Irish’s 
Pierce Crawford 
raced 
down 
the ice and was 
met by senior 
Nicholas Boka at 
his side. Taking 
it strong to the 
slot, 
Crawford 
finished 
the 
chance 
given 
to him with a 
simple over the 
shoulder wrister that extended the 
Notre Dame lead to two.
“You need your goalies to step 
up and make a save here and there 
for you,” said Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson. “... We left him in after 
it was 2-0. They had two goals on 
four shots. One was a breakaway 
and they had a good look on a 
power play.”

It’s hard to put all the fault on 
the goaltender when he has to 
defend against a power play and 
a breakaway — situations that 
inherently put netminders at a 
disadvantage.
Instead of pulling Lavigne from 
the game, Pearson gave him the 
benefit of the doubt.
“I wanted to let 
him battle through 
it,” Pearson said. 
“It wasn’t all on 
him. I just wanted 
to give him some 
confidence 
and 
see what he would 
do.”
Lavigne, 
in 
turn, “gave the 
team a chance to 
get back into the 
game.”
“But he made some good saves 
at the start of the second period 
to give us a chance,” Pearson said. 
“And we did, we made it 2-1.”
That was the end of the chance. 
Lavigne subsequently let in two 
goals, one on a push immediately 
after the Wolverines’ first goal. 
It was a drive down the ice that 
gave Jake Pivonka a one-on-one 
situation with Boka. Setting an 
unintentional screen on Lavigne, 
Boka could only watch as the puck 
sailed past him and Lavigne to 
return the deficit to two.
Lavigne’s 
failures 
to 
stop 
standard 
shots 
continued 
to 
increase once Notre Dame tacked 
on another, a goal that was 
deflected in immediately after a 
faceoff win.
“They’re just going in easy,” 
Pearson said. “And we were just 
starting to play well and they found 
the back of the net, and you’re just 
going to need that goaltending. 
You can’t give up four goals in a 
period and a half and expect to 
win on the road.”
Power play, breakaway, off 
a screen and deflected in — 
encompass all the ways in which 
the Fighting Irish scored on 
Lavigne. He saved the shots he 
should have saved but ultimately 
failed to save the ones that 
mattered.

You can’t give 
up four goals in 
a period and a 
half...

STATE COLLEGE — The ball 
fell through the net and Luke 
Yaklich’s head slumped over his 
body, hands falling forward, then 
everything else moving with it, the 
assistant coach’s posture shaping 
into an upside-down L.
It was just over three minutes 
into Tuesday night’s game and 
Jordan Poole had started to 
run back in transition. Zavier 
Simpson instead turned it over, 
leaving Myles Dread uncovered. 
He proceeded to hit a 3-pointer, 
and for Michigan, things went 
downhill from there.
The Wolverines’ defense — one 
Yaklich has helped build to the 
heights of a national title contender 
— came into State College ranked 
second in the country in adjusted 
efficiency. In the first half, it got 
rocked to the tune of 1.29 points 
per possession, and that wasn’t 
the biggest thing that went wrong 
in Michigan’s 75-69 loss to Penn 
State.

John Beilein got ejected for the 
first time in roughly 40 years. A 
second-half comeback fell short 
as the Wolverines couldn’t find 
a good shot after gaining control 
of the game. Poole’s shooting 
slump continued with a 1-of-8 
performance from beyond the 
arc. The Nittany Lions took it to 
Michigan on the offensive boards. 
This against a team that earned its 
second Big Ten win on Tuesday, 
whose student section wasn’t big 
enough to cover the court when 
they stormed it.
It was, you might say, a wake-up 
call.
The Wolverines haven’t played 
with a deficit like the 16 points they 
were down after Rasir Bolton hit 
three technical free throws to start 
the second half. They haven’t faced 
adversity like Beilein watching the 
second half on TV from a room 
inside the bowels of Bryce Jordan 
Center. It showed.
“We 
have 
to 
have 
more 
discipline,” said assistant coach 
Saddi Washington, who replaced 
Beilein 
in 
the 
second 
half. 
“Defensive end, I think we gave 
up two — at least three, maybe 
even four fouls on 3-point shots. 
Which were big. I don’t know how 
many of them they converted from 
the free throw line, but just little 
things like that.”
This loss was about more than 
John Beilein getting ejected, and 
it was about more than a few calls 
going against the Wolverines. 
Michigan is at a crossroads in its 
season. No longer is it invincible — 
three court-stormings, one at the 
building of the league’s bottom-
feeder, saw to that. Instead, it has 
lost two of four.
Its offense seems to have leveled 
out, and defense can’t win every 
game. Thus, days like Tuesday, 
where someone other than Charles 
Matthews needs to score in 
crunch-time and nobody can until 
it’s too late.
Some of that will get solved 

inherently — Jordan Poole won’t 
stay in a shooting slump forever. At 
times on Tuesday though, he tried 
to shoot himself out of it, jacking 
a pull-up two late in the first half. 
In his seat on the bench, Beilein 
leaned all the way back, arms 
crossed. The shot fell out. That, 
too, won’t work.
“He’s really a good 3-point 
shooter,” Beilein said. “He has 
gotta keep working on maybe 
taking the right shots. But I think 
there’s something that, right on, 
every slump — every guy’s gonna 
go through these times, where you 
have none of those 1-for-something 
games.”
After Tuesday, the Wolverines 
sit tied with Michigan State in 
the Big Ten standings, on the back 
of December and January wins. 
Their goals are bigger than the Big 
Ten though. Right now, meeting 
them requires something more — 
far more — than whatever Tuesday 
was.
The job of explaining that 
fell to redshirt junior Charles 
Matthews, who stood in a back 
hallway postgame donning a gray 
sweatshirt, stat-sheet in hand, 
voice low.
“We gotta be better than that as 
a collective group,” Matthews said. 
People talk about coach B getting 
ejected, that had nothing to do 
with it. We gave up 34 free throws 
attempts. You’re not winning a 
game, you can’t guard that. That’s 
23 free points right there.”
Matthews 
has 
a 
year 
of 
eligibility left, but at this point, 
seems unlikely to exercise it. It 
went unspoken after the loss, but 
everyone understood — this is 
probably his last, best chance to 
win a national title.
To do so, Michigan needs to 
get over the hump it found itself 
struggling with in State College. 
Fast.
“Time 
is 
running 
short,” 
Matthews said. “It ain’t no more, 
‘We’ll fix it later.’ Time is now.”

Last in line: University climate 
policy faces re-evaluation

ILLUSTRATION BY LAUREN KUZEE

I 
begged 
my 
mom to pack me 
American food for 
lunch every day. I wanted 
perfectly prepared meals with sliced 
green apples in a brown bag and a cute note on the nap-
kin. Almost every day from elementary school to high 
school graduation I ate either turkey and Swiss or peanut 
butter and jelly sandwiches. I prayed that she didn’t run 
out of time in the morning and resort to slapping sticky 
white rice with bulgogi beef into a container because on 
days like this, I knew I would be eating alone.
In the cafeteria, my peers would crowd around me 
and point at my main meal of the school day. They would 
sometimes pick it up and pass it around, bring it up to 
their faces for inspection, and eventually toss it back to 
me, calling it smelly and weird. These moments never 
ended. Even in high school someone glared at my piero-
gies and yelled across the table, “Ew, what is that? You 
brought dumplings to school?!”
I dealt with this pain and discomfort by stubbornly 
convincing myself I didn’t like Korean food. I stopped 
eating with my family at dinner, instead making my own 
pasta and taking it up to my room. I didn’t accept any of 
the homemade dishes my grandma made, and let my sis-
ter eat it all. I didn’t go out to eat at Korean restaurants, 
afraid that people would be able to smell the kimchi on 
my jacket afterwards. Before friends came over, I walked 
through my kitchen and hid anything Korean in the cabi-
nets for the perfect facade. My disillusioned self believed 
and desperately hoped that if I just rejected everything 
Korean, including food, I would one day wake up white 

and life would be simple and easy.
Then I went to college and started 
having late night cravings for my 
mom’s kkori gomtang” (oxtail 
soup). When I was up late study-
ing for an exam, I couldn’t 
stand the idea of eating even 
one more microwavable mac 
and cheese. I missed study-
ing at home, where my 
mom would come into my 
room with a plate of Asian 
pears perfectly skinned, 
cut and arranged into a 
circle. I missed my fam-
ily, a place of belonging 
and familiar food.
In college, I stopped 
caring about what I ate 
in front of other people. 
As soon as the option of 
Korean food was gone, I des-
perately craved it. I started to 
understand what my parents 
had meant when they said Korean 
food had so much more flavor and 
variety. I realized I had been in on 
this secret the whole time — the secret 
concoction of tasty yet healthy food, a com-
position of ingredients and tastes unique to the 
Korean people. I explained to friends that Korean 
food was more than just barbecue — Buddha bowls are 
a rip off of bibimbop, you can get poke bowls for half the 
price at the Korean grocery store, and soju has always 
been extremely popular — just not in America. I had been 
part of this secret club, but by the time I finally let myself 
enjoy it, when I could finally breathe, it was too late. I was 
in college, hundreds of miles away from home and from 
my mom’s food.
I craved Korean food so much that I started mixing 
together random ingredients and reminders of my child-
hood. Hidden on a shelf at Kroger, I found a small carton 
of gochujang (red chili paste). I mixed that with micro-
wavable sticky white rice and gim (dried seaweed) from 
Amazon Pantry. I close my eyes and savor the very slight 
taste of childhood in this pathetic mélange of ingredi-
ents. As I stand in the kitchen hoping that the bowl in 
my hands will turn into something much tastier, I am 
sad that I can’t have the food of my upbringing, and I am 
regretful that I rejected it when it was available to me. I 
am ashamed that I denied my family and my culture. I am 
also confused on as to why I ever thought Doritos tasted 
better than Korean shrimp crackers.
When I am homesick or stressed, more than anything 
I want my grandma’s home cooked meals with fresh pro-
duce straight from her garden — the truest form of farm 
to table. I miss the Korean grocery store where the nice 
employees would give me extra samples of the fish cakes 
and my dad would let me buy Korean chips against my 

mom’s rules. Non-Koreans probably don’t know the relief 
of smelling ramen with fresh scallions and poached egg 
cooking in the kitchen instead of hot cocoa after play-
ing in the snow. Nights in meant baked yams that were 
so sweet and delicious they didn’t need marshmallows or 
any other toppings found in the candy aisle. Nights out 
meant driving 45 minutes to go to our favorite soondubu 
jjigae (spicy soft tofu stew) restaurant and laughing for 
hours on end.
I reminisce about shaved ice with red bean paste and 
an assortment of toppings after playing in the backyard. 
Even when I was sweating and overheated, I used to swat 
my dad’s hand away and insist on spinning the ice shav-
ing machine by myself. Then when we ate buldak (fire 
chicken), I would grab him for help as I both cried and 
laughed from the spiciness. My family would coach me 
through the pain, as learning to handle extremely spicy 
food is a sign of being a true Korean.
These were the times when no one ridiculed me and 
made me feel different for what I ate because I was only 
surrounded by my family. I never had to explain myself to 
anyone because my family understood me, inside and out. 
It was only when I started elementary school and opened 
doors to people outside my home that I suddenly felt so 
vulnerable and abnormal. I didn’t understand what I had 
done wrong for people to outcast me, and dealt with the 
frustration and loneliness in a futile way.
When I left home and got sick for the first time in col-
lege, I fully realized that no one would ever love me as 
much my family does. While I was doubled over, they 
weren’t there to bring homemade rice porridge to my 
bed. Back home, someone used to always bring it on a 
tray, set with a glass of water and the exact amount of 
medicine I would need for the rest of the night. As the 
years went by and the decorations on my walls changed 
from Jonas Brothers posters to a Michigan flag, my fam-
ily was always the first to take care of me. The rice por-
ridge was all I wanted when I was sick and that’s still all 
I want.
For now, I have random Korean snacks and recipes I 
try to compile, even with no Korean grocery store nearby, 
and I am trying to make up for lost time and memories by 
learning, asking and participating every time I am home.
Now when I go home, my mom picks me up from the 
airport and we go straight to a Korean restaurant. I sit 
with her and my grandma, the three generations making 
dumplings together. I drive to my grandma’s house and 
ask her about her childhood in Korea as I eat the japchae 
(glass noodles) she makes for me. I am trying to watch 
Korean movies without subtitles so I can re-learn the 
language. I am still trying to apologize for the times I was 
too embarrassed of my Asian identity to walk next to my 
parents in public.
I am apologizing for a lot, but I am also trying to learn. 
The one thing I know for sure is that I will never again 
say no to the food my family offers me. To reject their 
food is to reject their love, and I have spent too many 
years already selfishly doing just that.

A

fter 
the 
Patri-
ots and the Rams 
kicked off the low-
est-scoring Super Bowl in 
its 53-year history, ad space 
became as scrutinized as the 
space between Rams wide 
receiver Brandin Cooks and 
the ball in the third quarter. 
Whether you were wear-
ing a Brady or Goff jersey at 
Charley’s last Sunday night, 
rivalries united during com-
mercial breaks to watch the 
notorious Super Bowl ads.
From 
the 
Backstreet 
Boys promoting Doritos, to 
Amazon Alexa controlling 
all the electricity on planet 
Earth, corporate America 
went above and beyond 
to entertain. Toyota and 
Google were among those 
that used their 30 seconds 
of fame to contribute to the 
ongoing national discussion 
on diversity and inclusion. 
Some could argue that the 
ads were more eventful than 
the 13-3 score. 
It is well known that 
each player takes home a 
nice bonus check for even step-
ping foot into Mercedes-Benz Stadium 
— $118,000bonus for each Patriots player 
and $59,000 for each Rams player accord-
ing to CNBC. This amounts to a huge pay 
raise for some players, but pocket change 
for those like Rams defensive tackle 
Aaron Donald, whose average annual sal-
ary amounts to $22.5 million. While Don-
ald has to work for an entire year to earn 
that sum, the real moneymaker is CBS, 
earning an average of $5.25 million for 
each 30-second commercial it airs. CBS’s 
final estimated paycheck for the night? 
Over $350 million.
While many entities saw a big pay day, 
Bud Light may have a different narrative. 
Despite it being a market leader, its con-
tinually declining market share result-
ed in ads as bold as a Hail Mary in an 
attempt to reverse this trend. Their part-
nership with HBO to advertise “Game 
of Thrones” made for a moderately con-
troversial ad that night, as the brand’s 
typically light-hearted scripts took a 
turn to adapt to the violent nature of the 
television show. Advertising two brands 
within an ad can often create beneficial 
synergies, but it is a risk within the short 
45-second timespan. Even more risky 
was pitching it to CBS, as displaying any 

violence is usually a tough sell. Neverthe-
less, the ad garnered successful buzz on 
social media.
What may be less of a hit with the U.S. 
justice system is Bud Light’s conten-
tious false advertisement targeting their 
direct competitor, MillerCoors. In an ad 
stemming from Bud Light’s “Dilly Dilly” 
campaign, a king reroutes a misdelivered 
barrel of corn syrup to Miller Lite, where 
Miller claims to have already received 
its shipment. The king then “rightfully” 
delivers it to Coors Lite. Within min-
utes of the ad airing, MillerCoors and 
the National Corn Growers Association 
struck back on Twitter.
MillerCoors CEO Gavin Hattersley 
and his executive team took to Twitter 
within minutes, citing the same idea: 
MillerCoors does not use high fructose 
corn syrup, though Anheuser-Busch 
InBev (Bud Light’s parent company), 
does. Adam Collins, vice president of 
communications and community affairs, 
followed this up with a reminder of 
MillerCoors’ 17 consecutive quarters of 
increasing market share, while Bud Light 
rides on a losing streak. The NCGA then 
expressed their disappointment in Bud 
Light for putting corn syrup back into a 
negative light, thanking Miller and Coors 

for their business. However, this only 
added grease — or rather, corn syrup — to 
the fire.
Since that eventful Sunday night, 
Twitter accounts have done everything 
but stay silent. The NGCA has since 
tweeted disappointment in Bud Light 
and their praise for MillerCoors. Two 
days after the Big Game, MillerCoors 
delivered free beer to NGCA, and issued 
two separate statements clarifying an 
interesting point: While they do use corn 
syrup in the fermentation process to help 
their beers taste better, they do not use 
high fructose corn syrup, the ingredient 
that carries the connotation of having 
links to obesity and diabetes. Bud Light, 
however, waited out the storm for three 
days before issuing its own statement via 
Twitter. Less apologetic, they presented 
it as a vintage piece of parchment writ-
ten by the king from their commercials, 
standing by the ad and emphasizing that 
they brew with rice, hops and barley, and 
not corn syrup. Interestingly enough, 
there is little to no difference between 
using rice and corn as a source of sugar in 
the fermentation process. But perception 
itself can make or break your product.
There is a greater context to the dis-
putes than just competitors MillerCoors 

and Anheuser-Busch InBev. 
According to Google Trends, it 
is estimated that more people 
have shown interest in corn 
syrup this month than ever 
before. This has resurfaced 
the conversation around high 
fructose corn syrup’s detri-
mental effect on American 
health, but Bud Light has made 
the effort to deem corn syrup 
synonymous to high fructose 
corn syrup by association. In 
light of this, companies have 
risen to the occasion to defend 
themselves before a spotlight 
lands on them, including Sam-
uel Adams and Frank’s Red 
Hots.
So, what’s the difference? 
While there is ongoing debate 
about the health disadvan-
tages of corn syrup and high 
fructose corn syrup, the Uni-
versity of California-Berkeley 
cites that while glucose (corn 
syrup’s main component) has 
a direct effect on blood sugar, 
fructose (high fructose corn 
syrup’s main component) has 
an immediate effect on blood 
fat, which could lead to a fatty 
liver and decreased insulin 
sensitivity. Companies lean away from 
promoting their use of either, but high 
fructose corn syrup comes with argu-
ably worse side effects and the baggage 
of negative cultural connotation.
While Twitter accounts wrap up their 
focus on the #corntroversy, a lawsuit 
could surface. Under the Lanham Act, if 
there is a misleading statement of mate-
rial fact in an ad that expressly uses the 
name of a competitor, it is deemed false 
advertising. Bud Light directly used 
MillerCoors’ name and implied that 
their beer contains corn syrup, which 
could ultimately result in a false adver-
tising claim. After all, corn syrup is used 
in the fermentation process, but alleg-
edly does not appear in the final product. 
Thus, if MillerCoors decides to pursue 
a case against Anheuser-Busch InBev, 
it will be up to the court to decide if the 
ad’s statements were materially false. In 
other words, would they impact a typical 
customer’s decision to purchase Miller-
Coors? If so, Bud Light could owe both 
monetary damages and an injunction 
from running the ad.
Bud Light may just have a court date in 
their future, but until then, cheers to CBS 
and #GoPats.

SuperBowl LIII: CBS wins big, 
Bud Light defeated

BY ROMY SHARMA, STATEMENT COLUMNIST


C

limate 
activists 
can 
usually 
remember the moment they real-
ized the magnitude of the ecologi-
cal problem humanity faces.
Ten years ago, Noah Weaverdyck, cur-
rently a doctoral student in physics at the 
University of Michigan and a member of 
Climate Action Movement, an environmen-
tal policy organization on campus, attended 
an environmental advocacy event at Goshen 
College. He had heard about climate change 
and its supposed dangers, but didn’t know 
much else. He decided to attend the event 
and listen to the featured speaker’s presen-
tation with an open mind.
The speaker was Bill McKibben, a 
renowned author and perhaps the most 
influential environmentalist in the coun-
try. McKibben recounted his experiences 
suffering through dengue fever, a painful 
and potentially fatal disease spread by mos-
quitoes whose habitats have expanded due 
to global warming. McKibben used this to 
underscore the global nature of the threat 
posed by climate change. Weaverdyck was 
struck by the certainty of this threat and the 
supreme importance of fighting it.
“That was what queued me into the real-
ity that this is the biggest thing that’s hap-
pening and has ever happened in terms of 
challenges facing humanity,” Weaverdyck 
said.
This is a perspective shared by scientists 
and activists around the world. There is a 
strong consensus in the scientific communi-
ty that the significant global warming of the 
last 150 years is both caused by human activ-
ity and preventable through the efforts of 
governments and individuals. This warming 
is caused by an overage of greenhouse gases 

in Earth’s atmosphere. These gases trap the 
sun’s energy in the atmosphere and warm 
the earth, an effect which normally keeps 
the planet habitable for life, but now threat-
ens to overheat it and irreparably harm the 
ecosystems on its surface.
A major goal in combating climate change 
is thus the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions into the atmosphere. American 
universities have made pledges in the last 
two decades to reduce their emissions and 
build permanent sustainable systems that 
will both reduce their impact on the envi-
ronment and provide resources to other 
communities and organizations to follow 
their lead.
The University of Michigan, however, 
has faced some criticism from students 
and faculty for lagging behind institutions 
with similar resources and academic stand-
ing. While the University has improved its 
environmental stature and made laudable 
efforts to build a more sustainable school, 
other Big Ten universities and elite research 
institutions have set more ambitious goals 
and made further progress in fighting cli-
mate change than the University.
Stanford University, for example, has 
been remarkably proactive when it comes to 
climate policy. The institution has commit-
ted to using 100 percent renewable energy 
by 2021 and is currently building its second 
solar power plant in order to meet that goal. 
Additionally, Ohio State University, histori-
cally Michigan’s biggest rival, has some of 
the most ambitious environmental policies 
of any school in the Big Ten. Its administra-
tion has pledged to cut its emissions by 50 
percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050 as 
well as achieve a zero waste system by 2025.

When asked how the University compares 
to such other schools, Andrew Berki, the 
director of the Office of Campus Sustain-
ability, said environmental policy should be 
evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
“Each school has a different approach 
to reducing its impact on the environment 
because each has different circumstances,” 
Berki wrote in an email interview with The 
Daily. “U-M involves a broad range of stake-
holders in the goal-setting and decision-
making process, which is important at our 
institution.”
It should be noted that the University 
does face several unavoidable challenges 
that make climate progress more difficult 
than at other schools. For example, the Uni-
versity administration has noted that Ann 
Arbor exists in a more extreme climate than 
both Stanford and Ohio State — its facilities 
require significantly more heating and cool-
ing energy to keep people safe and comfort-
able. The University, along with individual 
state residents, is also required by state law 
to use electricity from the local utility grid, 
which is more carbon-intensive than most 
others in the nation. The University invol-
untarily inherits the environmental impact 
of this electricity.
However, seeing the progress of these 
other institutions and spurred by the 
increasingly apparent dangers of climate 
change, concerned students and faculty have 
been pushing the University to make greater 
strides in its environmental policy. The most 
prominent campus advocacy group in recent 
months has been the Climate Action Move-
ment, a group of undergraduate and gradu-
ate students that was founded last year by 
LSA junior Julian Hansen.

CAM is now composed of several dozen 
students with considerable involvement 
in the campus environmental commu-
nity. These students are at the center of an 
increasingly urgent debate among activ-
ists, faculty and administrators over how 
to effectively combat climate change in 
higher education. Most members are part of 
other climate organizations, including Cli-
mate Blue, the Climate Reality Project, the 
Citizens’ Climate Lobby, Students for Clean 
Energy, the Sunrise Movement and under-
graduate environmental fraternities and 
sororities.
According to Sasha Bishop, a doctoral 
student in ecology and evolutionary biol-
ogy and a member of CAM, this wealth of 
experience informs much of CAM’s work; 
members make recommendations for policy 
and advocate for specific causes based on 
the expertise its members have gathered in 
their years of involvement in environmental 
activism. Bishop believes this is one of the 
core strengths of CAM and a reason for its 
considerable presence despite its relative 
youth.
Weaverdyck said a significant portion 
of CAM’s work has simply been spreading 
awareness about the University’s climate 
policies and their potential shortcom-

ings. Weaverdyck believes that most stu-
dents overestimate the University’s level of 
involvement because of its self-identification 
as a leader in higher education and scientific 
achievement.
“We need to raise a lot of awareness,” 
Weaverdyck said. “A lot of people assume 
that U-M, as this progressive campus, one of 
the world’s leading research institutions — 
people just assume that U of M is at the top 
when it comes to emissions reductions and 
being proactive. But that’s not the case.”
According to Weaverdyck, one of the 
biggest challenges for climate policy is the 
reluctance of the University leadership to 
set concrete goals as the administrators of 
other prominent universities have.
“When the leadership comes forward and 
sets a public goal — that’s what’s needed 
to get the huge machinery of a university 
to start moving and working together to 
achieve those goals,” Weaverdyck said.
For this reason, CAM has campaigned 
heavily for a firm commitment to carbon 
neutrality by 2035. Members have created 
a petition, published criticisms of the Uni-
versity’s policies and made appearances at 
the University’s Board of Regents meetings. 
After several months of lobbying and activ-
ism, the administration made a commitment 

to take action, and on Feb. 4, University 
President Mark Schlissel launched a com-
mission tasked with developing timelines 
and strategies for the University to achieve 
carbon neutrality.
However, members of the campus envi-
ronmental 
community 
have 
expressed 
concerns that the commission will not be 
effective in solving the problem. To explain 
their worries, Weaverdyck and Bishop cited 
the example of the President’ Greenhouse 
Gas Reduction Committee.
This committee was similarly formed to 
reduce the University’s carbon footprint 
in 2011, and it delivered a non-binding 
reportwith several recommendations in the 
summer of 2015. The University has made 
progress on several of the goals, including 
an upgrade to the Central Power Plant and 
plans to purchase renewable energy credits, 
which would allow the University to pay for 
the creation of renewable energy elsewhere. 
However, these plans still include extensive 
use of fossil fuels and no plans for future 
renewable energy sources on campus.
“We are currently implementing many 
of the GHG committee’s recommendations, 
including the Central Power Plant natu-
ral gas turbine; continued investment in 
the Energy Management Program, which 

focuses on energy conservation within some 
U-M buildings; on-campus demonstration 
projects; and renewable energy purchases,” 

Berki said.
Bishop and Weaverdyck also expressed 
worried about a perceived lack of account-
ability for the commission, again drawing 
parallels to the Greenhouse Gas Reduc-
tion Committee. They believe a firm com-
mitment from University leadership at the 
outset is the only way 
to ensure that prog-
ress will be made in the 
near future.
“It’s death by com-
mittee,” 
Weaverdyck 
said. “That’s something 
that we really can’t 
afford given the time-
line that the science 
makes clear. We can’t 
afford to lose another 
few 
years 
debating 
what the target is.”
Adam Simon, a pro-
fessor in the Earth and 
Environmental Scienc-
es Department, shares 
this 
concern. 
Simon 
has been a member of 
the Greenhouse Gas 
Reduction Committee 
since the summer of 
2017. He believes the 
committee has been 
able to do some produc-
tive work despite a few 
shortcomings.
“It was overall a posi-
tive experience,” Simon 
said. 
“There 
were 
certainly some times 
when I felt frustrated 
by what, to me, seemed 
like a slowness to react 
among the committee 
members.”
For instance, Simon 
was glad the committee 
met last year with the 
director of Renewable 

Energy at DTE Energy, which is a Detroit-
based energy company that runs the grid 
on which the city of Ann Arbor is situated. 
But he was sur-
prised 
to 
find 
out the commit-
tee 
had 
never 
done so before, 
describing 
the 
collaboration as 
a 
“no-brainer” 
that should have 
been 
started 
years previously.
Despite 
such 
delays, 
Simon 
praised members 
of the commit-
tee for initiating 
the relationship 
with DTE and 
cited it as an 
example of the 
kind of environmental work the University 
needs to be doing moving forward. In his 
view, it will be absolutely necessary to bring 
in outside expertise to accelerate the work 
of the Commission on Carbon Neutrality.
“I hope that (the Commission on Carbon 
Neutrality) does exactly what we need it to 
do, which is to reach out to people in the real 
world who do this for a living and figure out 
how we can partner with private industry 
to make carbon neutrality a reality,” Simon 
said.
Simon has also expressed particular 
concern about the University’s 2011 goal of 
reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 25 
percent by 2025 — which, remeber, is a goal 
among the least ambitious in the Big Ten. As 
of 2018, the University has achieved only a 
7 percent reduction from the 2006 baseline 
measurement.
The impending upgrade to the Central 
Power Plant is expected to reduce emis-
sions further, to around 12 or 13 percent. 
Right now, the University buys roughly 
two thirds of its energy from DTE Energy. 
The other third is produced by the Central 
Power Plant. Once the plant is upgraded, the 
University will produce about half of its own 
energy.
The Greenhouse Gas Committee’s report 
stated this upgrade is the single largest 
contributor toward meeting the emissions 
reduction goal. But the report also noted 
the upgrade ties the University to fossil 
fuels for at least another two decades, and 
likely more. Natural gas still has a notable 
environmental impact due to the emissions 
involved in its use.
Emissions are often organized into three 
categories, called scope 1, scope 2 and scope 
3. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions 
from owned sources. Scope 2 emissions are 
indirect emissions from the generation of 
energy that an institution purchases. Scope 
3 emissions are all indirect emissions, not 
included in scope 2, that occur from sources 
not owned or controlled by the institution.

The University does not count scope 
3 emissions in its measurements, and 
neither do other institutions; this is 
the standard procedure for emissions 
measures. But during the extraction, 
storage and transportation of natural 
gas, methane — a greenhouse gas — 
leaks into the atmosphere and warms 
the planet. These emissions fall under 
scope 3 and are thus not considered 
when calculating emissions reduc-
tions. This means the reductions are 
being measured without considering 
the life-cycle environmental impact 
of the natural gas that the University 
uses. Because of this, Simon expressed 
frustration with the lackluster impact 
of the Central Power Plant upgrade.
“For a university our size, with an 
$11 billion endowment and some of 
the greatest intellectual power on the 
planet, we should have nailed that 
target,” Simon said. “We should have 
moved beyond that target.”
Proponents of the plan say the 
upgrades will reduce emissions and 
give the University time to consider 
renewable energy sources.
“It is important in the view of the 
committee to establish concrete plans 
for alternate fuels for this facility in 
the longer term, and/or ways to offset 
its emissions,” the Greenhouse Gas 
Reduction Committee’s report reads. 
“It will also be important for the uni-
versity to be clear that this investment 
is part of a transition toward carbon-
free alternatives.”
Simon noted the University has 
made negligible progress on finding 
significant long-term renewable ener-
gy sources. When asked about the Uni-
versity’s progress in this search, Berki 
said there are “currently no plans” 
for future sustainability measures 
at the Central Power Plant. Accord-
ing to Berki, the University’s plan 
for renewables in the future is to buy 
more renewable energy credits, which 
would technically reduce the Universi-
ty’s emissions by paying for the use of 
renewable energy generated and used 
elsewhere. But according to the Green-
house Gas Reduction Committee’s 
report, this kind of action “is unlikely 
to be viewed as the action of a climate 
leader or to engage the campus com-
munity in the vision and implementa-
tion of GHG reduction.”
Schlissel, for his part, has stated the 
administration’s priority is forming a 
specific technical plan before making 
a pledge for carbon neutrality. Previ-
ously, he said he believes the Univer-
sity will be better placed to carry out 
its goal if it starts with a complete plan 
rather than setting an arbitrary dead-
line.

“I don’t know how we’re 
going to get there yet. So what 
good does it do for me to put out 
a statement that says I’m going 
to do something on a certain day 
if I don’t know how I’m going to 
do it?” Schlissel said in an inter-
view with The Daily in October. 
“We want to do it in a way that 
other organizations can follow 
what we do and become carbon 
neutral themselves.”
Weaverdyck, however, said 
he believes the University has 
already missed its opportunity 
to be a leader in tackling climate 
change. Both he and Bishop 
think methods for reaching car-
bon neutrality are in no short 
supply and that the University 
merely needs to follow the path 
of other similar institutions that have 
already made progress toward similar 
goals.
“The problem, historically, has not 
been in generating those technical 
plans,” Bishop said. “The University of 
Michigan is a top-tier research insti-
tute. We have had committees come 
up with these plans before. We have 
the skills. We have the resources. The 
problem has been not committing the 
resources and not having any reason to 
do so (in the absence of a public goal).”
Simon, Bishop and Weaverdyck all 
expressed approval for the climate pol-
icies of certain schools similar to the 
University. They singled out Stanford 
University; Michigan State University; 
University of California, Berkeley; the 
University of Illinois and Ohio State 
University for particular praise.
In Simon’s view, one of the drivers of 
these schools’ success is people in posi-
tions of power who can make the nec-
essary change at the university level. 
This is a view shared by Weaverdyck 
and Bishop, who believe the absence 
of a high-level administration official 
dedicated to tackling environmental 
policy conveys a lack of interest in the 
area from University leaders.
“We think it has to do with a dif-
fusion of accountability and respon-
sibility,” Weaverdyck said. “There’s 
nobody put in charge. When you don’t 
have an individual who’s high up and 
who’s accountable to that and have 
them have a clear target or a goal that 
they’re appointed to help meet, then 
nobody really knows what we’re aim-
ing for.”
Simon also said he believes the 
administration’s focus has been in 
the wrong places, which has hindered 
development of a more comprehensive 
climate plan.
“What really has limited our abil-

ity to make progress is the absence of 
people who are progressive thinkers,” 
Simon said. “I think for the admin-
istration, it hasn’t been an issue they 
seem to be concerned with.”
Members of CAM believe the Uni-
versity’s reluctance to join any of the 
nationwide academic environmental 
coalitions is evidence of this. These 
organizations work to foster collabo-
ration between schools and help those 
schools become more sustainable in 
the long term. They include the Cli-
mate Leadership Network and Ameri-
can College & University Presidents’ 
Climate Commitment, which inspired 
the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050 
set by Ohio State University and doz-
ens of other colleges.
Simon said he believes current Uni-
versity policy is hypocritical in some 
respects. He said he sees a school that 
teaches its students extensively about 
the dangers of climate change and the 
threat it poses to human civilization, 
but neglects to take significant action 
and demonstrate its resolve to combat 
that threat.
“We can’t continue to preach a mes-
sage in our classrooms that climate 
change is today’s civil rights move-
ment and yet not do anything at all to 
mitigate our effect on climate,” Simon 
said. “To be honest with you, if I were 
a student, I would be confused and 
depressed.”
This 
sentiment 
is 
shared 
by 
Weaverdyck and Bishop. Members of 
CAM have emphasized in their mes-
saging that colleges — particularly 
large and well-funded elite research 
institutions — are uniquely well placed 
to be leaders when it comes to environ-
mental policy. Though the individual 
impact of a school’s emissions is small 
when compared to global emissions, 
the University can set an example for 

active and intellectually rigorous cli-
mate action and aid other institutions 
in the fight.
“There’s so much well-informed 
consensus on precisely how cata-
strophic the impacts of climate change 
can be,” Bishop said. “It isn’t a question 
anymore of if people should be doing 
something about it. The University is 
in a position to address what is essen-
tially the defining problem of right 
now.”
“Frankly, 
if 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan can’t do this, then how 
can we expect anybody to do this?” 
Weaverdyck said. “This should be the 
easiest thing for this institution over 
any institution, given our resources, 
given our understanding, given our 
mandate. This should be the lowest 
hanging fruit.”
Above all, members of the cam-
pus environmental community have 
expressed a supreme disappointment 
with the University’s policies. They 
see it as a shortcoming not merely in 
addressing the issue, but in staking a 
claim as one of the foremost universi-
ties in the world and a true leader in 
higher education.
“If you look at the intellectual 
power we have across campus, among 
our faculty, staff and students, and 
you compare us to other universities, 
we’re so far behind (in combatting cli-
mate change) that it’s embarrassing,” 
Simon said. “You don’t do it because 
the shame game makes you look bad. 
You do it because you claim to be the 
world’s best university and a university 
that is committed to making a positive 
impact for our global society. Scientific 
consensus is that we need to mitigate 
humans’ effect on the climate. And as 
the University of Michigan, we should 
be leading that. We shouldn’t be fol-
lowing others.”

“We can’t continue to preach a 
message in our classrooms that 
climate change is today’s civil rights 
movement and yet not do anything at 
all to mitigate our effect on climate,” 
Simon said. “To be honest with you, if 
I were a student, I would be confused 
and depressed.”

F
or 
the 
last 
three 
years, 
I’ve measured my self-worth by an 
admission officer’s decision. I spent 
countless hours drafting Common 
Application essays about my commu-
nity and “Why Michigan?” to prove 
I was worthy of going to the Univer-
sity of Michigan. The first two times 
I was rejected, it felt personal. I had 
bared everything in my essays, hop-
ing they’d look past my sub-30 ACT 
score and two Cs from high school 
and see that as a person, I was a good 
fit for the University. When I finally 
got in, I changed my Instagram bio, 
bought a Michigan pennant flag, and 
stole my sister’s old block ‘M’ pin to 
put on my backpack. Now that I’m 
here, though, I’m torn between being 
proud of my acceptance and being 
ashamed of how long it took me. I 
don’t even know which I’d rather 
be. My identity crisis has stemmed 
not from the need to differentiate 
myself, but rather a desire to be like 
every other student crossing the 

Diag.
In 
some 
ways, 
being 
a 
transfer 
student is a lot like being a 
freshman all over again — I, too, 
have struggled with a new campus 
and navigating Mason Hall’s weird 
floor number system. And just like 
the other eager freshmen, I found all 
my classrooms before the semester 
started so I wouldn’t get lost. But as 
a transfer student, I’m not naive — I 
know how to send an email to a pro-
fessor and manage my time. I’m used 
to the demands of higher education 
and the freedom of eating cookies for 
dinner. Plus, I know how to properly 
dress for a November football game 
at the Big House.
As a transfer student, instead of 
worrying about making friends, I 
wonder if non-transfer students can 
tell it’s only my first year here. I am 
not scared of raising my hand in 
class, but rather I am nervous about 
my classmates finding out I wasn’t 
good enough to get in the first or 
even second time. When the inevi-
table “What year are you?” is asked, 

I stumble over my words. I issue 
a caveat every time, explaining 
that I’m a junior but I trans-
ferred. It’s a simple question 
and should have a simple 
answer, but I think I’d 
rather people know my 
flaw than think I’m try-
ing to conceal it.
I have a friend who 
once said to me, “Liter-
ally no one cares that 
you’re a transfer stu-
dent.” It was meant to 
be comforting — a keen 
observation that I care 
too much about how peo-
ple view me. Now though, 
when I think about the com-
ment, it comes across in a dif-
ferent way. 
I don’t want to belittle the 
work I did to get into the Univer-
sity — I had to change everything 
in order to be accepted. I started 
caring about my grades and meeting 
with professors to actually learn the 
material instead of memorizing it. 
The feeling of getting a hard-earned 
A was addicting, and I became an 
entirely different student than I 
was in high school. I could’ve gone 
to a mid-tier, four-year college, but 
I decided that the University was 
worth it. In some ways it was, but 
at times it feels like I’m the only one 
who sacrificed something to be here. 
And that I’m the only one who can’t 
seem to move past the typical “col-
lege experience” I chose to give up.
On the other hand, I’ve never 
been surrounded by so many people 
committed to their schoolwork. The 
general atmosphere on campus and 
in the classroom reflects the reputa-
tion the University’s students have 
earned, and now I’m part of it. I bond 
with my classmates over grades and 
studying. We compare classes we’ve 
taken and who has had less sleep. 
The pressure and expectation of 
good grades and a successful career 
pushes me to work harder in order 
to keep up with my peers and that 
excites me. 
I remember my dad once took me 
on an unofficial tour of the Universi-

ty when I was still in high school. We 
walked through Hatcher Graduate 
Library and it struck me how many 
generations of students have stud-
ied there. Silently, I wished I were 
like them: self-motivated and hard-
working. Now, when I walk into the 
Reference Room, I view them as my 
peers. When I study, I don’t feel like 
an outsider. I remember how desper-
ately I wanted to go here and how I 
once prayed for the chance to pull an 
all-nighter at the library. In this way, 
I belong at the University. 
People often ask me how the Uni-
versity of Michigan compares to my 
previous school. It’s hard to answer 
exactly, especially with how much 
this university means to me. But stu-
dents here care more — about every-
thing. 
We’re connected through our 
mutual love for the University, but 
also through our passion for aca-
demics. Before this fall, I had never 
seen people in the library on a Satur-
day morning. I’d never heard casual, 
intelligent conversations about the 
doctrine of socialism. I’ve had more 
book recommendations this semester 
than ever before. I feel as though I’m 
constantly absorbing my surround-
ings, soaking up an environment that 
will disappear after I graduate. We’re 
students who naturally thrive when 
we’re learning, and I truly fit in here. 
It’s comforting — the feeling of relat-
ing to a larger community. School is 
our commonality, and I’ve never felt 
more connected to the strangers that 
surround me. 
In August, at my transfer orienta-
tion, they gave out these little pins 
that say “I <3 Transfers.” They told 
us to put them on our backpacks so 
we could easily spot other trans-
fer students. Is it as easy to spot my 
struggle as it is a bright maize pin? 
I’ve seen a couple of them around 
campus and each time I’m reminded 
that I can’t be the only person strug-
gling with this duality. Right now, 
it’s sitting on my dresser in my room, 
a subtle reminder that I’m a minor-
ity among U-M students. And I can’t 
decide whether it’s a badge of honor 
or a badge of shame.
