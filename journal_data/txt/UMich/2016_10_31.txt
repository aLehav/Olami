The University of Michigan 

Bicentennial 
Office 
released 

their plans Monday morning 
for the anticipated year-long 
celebration of the University’s 
bicentennial 
in 
2017, 
which 

include festivals, lecture series 
and themed semesters.

Both LSA semesters of the 

year are slated to be themed. 
Next year’s winter semester will 
focus on “Making Michigan,” 
or the history of the University, 
while the 2017 fall semester 
centers 
around 
“Michigan 

Horizons: The Possible Futures 
of U-M” and looking ahead to the 
University’s third century.

According to the Bicentennial 

Office, many of the events will 
feature prominent alumni and 
guest speakers: notable alumni, 
such as actors Darren Criss and 
James Earl Jones, will headline 
a spring festival next April, 
while Supreme Court Justice 
Sonia Sotomayor is scheduled 
to speak in January at the first 
of a yearlong series of symposia 
hosted by University President 
Mark Schlissel. The Bicentennial 
Office and Advisory Committee 
— appointed in 2011 by then 
University president Mary Sue 
Coleman — is also working 
with student groups to ensure 
a number of annual events, 
such as the Martin Luther King 
Symposium in January, tie back 

U.S. 
Sen. 
Tim 
Kaine, 

Democratic 
vice 
presidential 

nominee, spoke at events in 
Taylor and Warren, Mich. on 
Sunday, visiting the state just nine 
days away from the presidential 
election.

According to an average of 

polls from Real Clear Politics, 
Clinton is currently projected to 
win Michigan by seven points.

Michigan Sens. Gary Peters 

(D) and Debbie Stabenow (D), as 
well as U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell 
(D–Dearborn), 
also 
attended 

the event in Taylor, which was 
hosted by the 1A region of the 
Union of Auto Workers.

Kaine’s Taylor rally focused 

in part on FBI director James 
Comey’s 
Friday 
letter 
to 

Congress, which stated the FBI 
is looking into additional emails 
that may be tied to a previous 
investigation into Clinton’s use of 
a private server for email during 
her time as Secretary of State, 
found during a separate inquiry 
into former U.S. Rep. Anthony 
Weiner 
(D-NY). 
Weiner 
is 

married to Clinton campaign aide 
Huma Abedin. In July, Comey 
told Congress he was closing the 
investigation into Clinton’s use of 
the server and it would not result 
in any criminal charges.

Kaine 
said 
Sunday 
that 

despite Friday’s announcement, 
he remains confident that no 
prosecutor would press charges, 
adding that Clinton supporters 

have not been deterred by the 
letter.

“The FBI’s recent letter has 

actually 
revved 
up 
people,” 

Kaine said. “We have record 
voter registration this cycle. The 
Trump campaign wants people 
to be distracted and not vote 
because he knows that’s the only 
way he can win. I can tell you 
folks this: nobody is distracted.”

In an interview prior to 

the event, Peters declined to 

speculate about what motivated 
Comey’s decision to send the 
letter, and said it was important 
for the FBI to clarify their 
position.

“I think it is imperative, given 

the unprecedented nature of 
releasing information pertaining 
to an investigation publicly — in 
particular a few days out of an 
election — that the FBI release 
the remaining emails so the 
public can see what is in them 

and clear up any remaining 
concerns,” Peters said

Speaking before Kaine took 

the stage, Peters emphasized 
Clinton and Kaine’s values to a 
crowd of about 150.

“Both Hillary Clinton and 

Tim Kaine over the course of the 
past few months and during the 
debates have proven themselves 
to be the leaders we deserve,” 
Peters said. “This is in clear 

A documentary about the life 

of Miya Rodolfo-Sioson, a lone 
survivor of a 1991 shooting at the 
University of Iowa, was screened 
Friday afternoon at the Harlan 
Hatcher Graduate Library for 
an audience of five community 
members and one student.

The screening of “Miya of the 

Quiet Strength” was part of the 
annual month-long Investing in 
Ability series, themed “Diversity 
Includes Disability,” through the 
University of Michigan Council 
for Disability Concerns.

Patricia Anderson, one of the 

event organizers, said Rodolfo-
Sioson’s story is emblematic of 
the intersection of disability and 
diversity due to her activism 
for disability rights across a 
spectrum of ethnicities.

“Miya’s 
story 
was 
chosen 

because of its current relevance as 
well as the intersectionality of her 
story as a Philippine immigrant 
of 
political 
activist 
parents, 

her work among Hispanic and 
Latino/Chicano communities and 
her work as a disabilities advocate 
and activist,” Anderson said.

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Fifth-year senior defensive tackle Ryan Glasgow and redshirt junior defensive tackle Maurice Hurst celebrate Michigan’s win and yell for the Paul Bunyan trophy at 
Spartan Stadium Saturday.

EAST LANSING — They came 

for Paul Bunyan, and they left with 
him, even if it wasn’t exactly the 
way they wanted.

This was true during the game 

for the Michigan football team, 

and it was true afterward, when a 
handful of Wolverines arrived on 
the Michigan State sideline looking 
for their hard-earned trophy, only 
to be told it was already in their 
locker room.

“Me and Delano (Hill) went 

to go on the field so we could run 
around and get little victory laps,” 
said senior cornerback Jourdan 

Lewis. “But, hey, we got it back. I’m 
excited to get it back home.”

There may not have been a 

more fitting way to cap the day for 
Michigan.

Heavily 
favored 
coming 

into 
Saturday’s 
game 
against 

Michigan 
State, 
the 
second-

ranked Wolverines (5-0 Big Ten, 
8-0 overall) came in with a feeling 

they might finally reclaim the Paul 
Bunyan Trophy for the first time 
since 2012. They did just that with 
a 32-23 win, but they still weren’t 
completely satisfied in how they 
did so.

“I was excited we got the win — 

hell of a win against Sparty,” Lewis 
said. “At the same time, there’s a lot

In a recent study led by the 

University of Michigan, just 92 
randomized control trials were 
found to have been conducted 
on immediate treatments for 
cardiac arrest over the past 20 
years — a disproportionately low 
number given the 535,000 cases 
of cardiac arrest per year.

A University press release said 

although cardiac arrest kills 10 
times more people in the United 
States than breast cancer, there 
is an immense lack of research 
aimed at treatment and survival 
of 
patients 
who 
experience 

cardiac arrest.

Shashank Sinha, a third-year 

general cardiology fellow at 
the University Health System 
who was the lead researcher 
of the study, said the amount 
of 
research 
is 
unacceptably 

low, noting fewer than five 
randomized control trials were 
published annually over the past 
20 years.

“What 
we 
found 
in 
a 

nutshell was a striking paucity 
of randomized clinical trials 
relative to the burden of cardiac

SPOOKY.
puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

Last year, Engineering junior 

Chris Baldwin found himself as 

the poster child of a dark period 

in Michigan football history. After 

the last second 27-23 loss in the 

Michigan State game last year, 

his reaction was immortalized 

as a meme. But as of Saturday, 

Baldwin can finally follow up 

with a victorious pose after the 

University’s win against Michigan 

State University, 32-23.

In the waning seconds of last 

year’s game against Michigan 

State University, MSU overtook 

the Wolverines on a fumbled punt. 

The student section of the stadium 

was silent, jaws agape, at the quick 

turn of the scoreboard. Their shock 

was summed up perfectly with 

Baldwin’s stunned expression, 

hands clasped on his head in a 

pose social media users dubbed the 

“surrender cobra.” Baldwin quickly 

became an internet emblem, his 

face spread out among sports new 

outlets and Twitter accounts alike. 

An East Lansing T-shirt company, 

Michigan Shirt Works, even made 

T-shirts in his honor.

Baldwin is also a member of 

The Michigan Daily’s staff.

Baldwin said in an interview 

that he felt this weekend’s win 

was a personal redemption.

“It was a lot of fun being at 

the game, regardless of what 

happened last year,” he said. “If 

there was any curse around me, 

that’s done with.”

The past may be behind 

Baldwin, but the cameras still 

aren’t. He attended the game with 

a group of friends and took, by 

his count, more than 100 pictures 

with fans of both teams.

“People swarmed out of their 

seats to come talk to me,” he said.

Baldwin’s Twitter bio still 

reads “nationally famous for 

being a University of Michigan 

student and a sports fan,” a title 

he claimed after his face graced 

Facebook pages and Twitter 

timelines.

“I guess I was doing the 

surrender cobra pose,” Baldwin 

said in an interview with the Daily 

last year. “And now everybody 

knows who I am … I felt a bunch 

of text messages right after the 

game ended, but I figured it was 

just people talking about the game 

because, of course, it was crazy.”

City of Detroit’s move to remove 

graffiti from plant sparks criticism

University professors, students raise economic, articist concerns

The 
Packard 
Automotive 

Plant, 
the 
infamous 
image 

of Detroit’s poverty turned 
‘graffiti haven’ — the abandoned 
building is covered in neon 
designs and tags — is being 
wiped clean.

Located off of Interstate 

94 in Detroit, the plant closed 
in 1956, making it the largest 
abandoned plant in the world. 
It gained so much attention 
locally and internationally for 
graffiting by organizers and 
artists that in 2010, Banksy, 
an internationally renowned 
street artist, tagged one of his 
murals on a wall of the plant. 

The city of Detroit, however, 

announced last week that it 
plans to clean up the Packard 
Plant, 
which 
will 
mean 

removing the graffiti from the 

portion of the plant the city 
owns and encouraging the 
owner of the rest of the Packard 
Plant, Fernando Palazuelo, to 
do the same. This has sparked 
debate regarding the duties 
of private property owners in 
Detroit as well as what the role 
of graffiti and street art will be 
in Detroit’s future.

These renovations will not 

been cheap. So far, the city 
has spent about $19,000 in 
its graffiti clean-up project 
and Palazuelo is projected to 
spend $100,000 if he agrees to 
clean his portion of the plant, 
according to the Detroit Free 
Press.

Members of the University of 

Michigan community with ties 
to Detroit had mixed reactions 
about 
the 
effect 
removing 

the graffiti and the overall 
renovation project would have 
on the city. 

Critics 
of 
the 
initiative, 

such as Nick Tobier, professor 
in the School of Art & Design, 
said they feel as though this is 
an inappropriate allocation of 
government funds.

“I would say that there 

are 
tons 
of 
neighborhoods 

throughout Detroit that have 
been marked by, if you describe 
it as, vandalism or graffiti or 
broken windows,” Tobier said . 
“And the lack of investment and 
municipal infrastructure from 
street lighting to sidewalks is 
much more urgent, in terms 
of the number of people it 
effects, than protecting private 
investment.”

While 
both 
the 
city 
of 

Detroit’s 
General 
Services 

Department 
and 
Palazuelo 

were unavailable for immediate 
comment. 
However, 
Tobier 

emphasized the plant’s private 
owners.

“The Packard Plant is now 

privately owned,” Tobier said. 

“If a private owner wants to 
remove graffiti from their 
building, that’s completely 
up to them. I can’t see why 
municipal or local funds 
should be used to remove 
graffiti 
from 
something 

that’s owned by a Peruvian 
hotel investor.”

Andrew 
Thompson, 

an Art & Design School 
lecturer 
who 
lives 
in 

Detroit, added that he feels 
removing graffiti from the 
Packard Plant is more of a 
public relations maneuver 
than a legitimate attempt 
at improving the welfare of 
Detroit’s residents.

“Sure, the city wanting 

to remove all the graffiti 
and clean up the Packard 
Plant is fine, but what about 
the neighborhood directly 
adjacent to the Packard 
Plant where there’s blighted 
buildings 
in 
between 

individual 
homeowners’ 

houses that I think would 
actually 
make 
a 
bigger 

difference 
in 
residents’

Themed Semesters

LSA departments will devote 

the winter 2017 semester to 
exploring the origins of the 
University of Michigan system 
and examining its role in the 
state, nation and world through 
course offerings and symposia 
complimented by a series of 
lectures and discussions. In a 
University press release, History 
Prof. Gregory Parker, a member 
of the theme semester planning 
committee, 
emphasized 
the 

intersection of University history 
with broader national and global 
trends.

“Our idea is to invite the entire 

campus to understand and unpack 
these connections, to learn how 
Michigan was shaped by our 
world and, in turn, how Michigan 
has influenced the globe,” Parker 
said.

Next 
year’s 
fall 
semester, 

named 
“Michigan 
Horizons,” 

will aim to foster brainstorming 
on what the future holds for 
large research institutions like 
the University. In addition to 
academic programming, Schlissel 
will hold an event with multiple 
university administrators from 
around the nation on the future 
of research institutions in June. 
Susan E. Alcock, professor of 
archaeology and classics and 
special 
counsel 
to 
Schlissel 

for institutional outreach and 
engagement, said in a press release 
the 
discussion 
will 
examine 

strengths and weaknesses of 
universities’ public missions.

“The conversation will focus 

on the ever-evolving bargain, or 

compact, between the research 
university and society at large,” 
Alcock said.

Outdoor festivals in spring, 

summer and fall

An outdoor fair will serve as a 

centerpiece for each semester’s 
celebration. 
In 
total, 
the 

University will hold expositions 
in spring, summer and next fall 
in Ann Arbor and will also host a 
festival in Detroit next September.

UMich200 
Spring 
Festival 

is the first of the celebrations, 
and will take place next April. 
Scheduled 
events 
include 

historical 
building 
tours, 
a 

cultural festival and a multimedia 
event capping off the celebration 
at Hill Auditorium that will 
feature actors Darren Criss and 
James Earl Jones, in addition 
to director of the White House 
Domestic Policy Council Cecilia 
Muñoz.

The summer fair will celebrate 

University faculty and staff in 
collaboration with the annual 
Ann Arbor summer festival.

The Third Century Expo, 

the fall finale, will preview 
projects and initiatives moving 
the University into its next 100 
years with a public fair spanning 
the Diag and Ingalls Mall on 
homecoming 
weekend 
next 

year. Gary Krenz, the executive 
director of the Bicentennial Office, 
said in a press release exhibits will 
be interactive and futuristic, and 
follow in the spirit of world’s fairs, 
such as the Chicago World Fair in 
1893.

“Fair-goers will find exhibits 

that 
encourage 
hands-on 

engagement, rather than a passive 
experience where they are told 
to ‘look, but don’t touch,’ ” Krenz 
said.

In between the summer and 

fall celebrations, the University 

is planning a day of festivities in 
Detroit in September to honor 
the University’s birthplace and 
its connection to the city with 
exhibitions and a large-scale oral 
history project headed by the 
Detroit Center.

Plans released by Bicentennial 

Office 
also 
includes 
a 

commemoration 
of 
native 

peoples, as tribes native to 
Michigan originally entered into 
a treaty ceding control of land to 
the University in 1817 when it was 
located in Detroit. Neither the 
press release nor plans from the 
office, however, specified what 
such events will look like.

Alumni Awards and Grant 

Initiatives

The University is dedicating 

awards and need-based student 
aid to students in an effort to 
include a greater portion of 
the campus community in the 
commemoration. 
One 
such 

initiative is the Bicentennial 
Alumni 
Award, 
which 
will 

acknowledge 
recent 
alumni 

making significant contributions 
in their fields.

The Bicentennial Office is 

also 
introducing 
a 
year-long 

design contest — with an award 
of $25,000 — asking students to 
reimagine both physical spaces 
and teaching methods in 2067. 
According to the Bicentennial 
Office, a “nationally renowned 
panel” will review submissions 
in the spring, and 20 teams have 
already submitted proposals.

Proceeds from bicentennial 

merchandise slated to be sold at 
the M Den, the official retailer 
of 
the 
University’s 
Athletic 

Department, 
will 
go 
toward 

the Undergraduate Scholarship 
Fund, one of the University’s main 
avenues for distributing need-
based aid to students.

of things we can clean up. And we 
saw that during the game, and we 
saw that we didn’t play our best 
game in the fourth quarter. And 
that’s kind of disappointing — 
kind of took away a little bit from 
our celebration, because I wanted 
to dominate them and we didn’t.”

Until midway through the 

fourth quarter, Michigan was 
dominating. The Wolverines led 
30-10, verging on a blowout win 
in a series that had haunted them 
for the better part of a decade. But 
then Brian Lewerke, the third 
quarterback Michigan State used, 
threw a touchdown pass to Monty 
Madaris, and with 7:31 remaining, 
the would-be comeback started.

In a rivalry that last year 

came down to a fumbled punt 
snap that was returned for a 
touchdown, the tension built as 
the Spartans (0-5, 2-6) started 
putting it together. After being 
benched earlier in the game, 
Spartans starter Tyler O’Connor 
led another touchdown drive 
in the game’s waning moments. 
He hit freshman Donnie Corley 
in the end zone with one second 
remaining, trimming the deficit 
to seven.

At the time, there was still a 

chance — however infinitesimal 
— that Michigan State could pull 
off another miracle. A recovered 

onside kick could have given the 
Spartans half a prayer.

But instead of kicking the 

extra point, Michigan State went 
for two and ended up fumbling 
the ball. It was picked up and 
returned by redshirt sophomore 
linebacker 
Jabrill 
Peppers, 

bringing the score to 32-23 and 
smothering any hint of a spark.

Then came a kneel-down by 

redshirt sophomore quarterback 
Wilton Speight, a backflip by 
Peppers and a celebration that 
must have felt like an eternity 
in the making. Even as players 
maintained that they approached 
this game like every other, fans 
surely felt the tension as they 
swallowed one last breath of 
doubt before a triumphant exhale.

“(The 
fourth 
quarter) 
felt 

like the whole second half,” said 
senior running back De’Veon 
Smith. “It literally felt like the 
whole entire second half. I just 
wanted it to end. I wanted it to be 
over.”

Right from the outset, the 

Spartans showed they wouldn’t 
go quietly. On the first drive of 
the game, Michigan State rode LJ 
Scott’s legs to a 12-play, 75-yard 
scoring drive. Scott carried the 
ball 10 times on that drive and 
finished the game with 22 rushes 
for 139 yards and a touchdown.

Michigan responded, though, 

with a pair of big drives of its 
own. Peppers evened the game at 
seven with a touchdown run from 
the wildcat formation, and after 

a defensive stop, Smith punched 
it in from a yard out on the next 
drive to give the Wolverines a 14-7 
lead.

From that point on, Michigan 

never trailed. It tacked on another 
touchdown and a pair of field 
goals in the first half, going into 
halftime up 27-10. At that point, 
the Wolverines had piled up 287 
yards at 8.7 per play.

A scoreless third quarter made 

the outcome seem like a foregone 
conclusion, and ultimately, it 
turned out to be. Michigan 
outgained the Spartans, 436-401, 
and Speight said the game was not 
as close as the score indicated. But 
it wasn’t lopsided, either.

Michigan State racked up 

231 yards in the fourth quarter 
compared 
to 
41 
from 
the 

Wolverines, carving up a defense 
that until then had been stingy.

“We just didn’t go out and 

play,” Lewis said. “They played a 
tough game the whole way. They 
were trying to beat us. They were 
trying to give us their all the 
whole game. And we just didn’t 
come out as intense as we did (in) 
the second and third quarter.”

In 
that 
sense, 
it 
wasn’t 

necessarily the victory Michigan 
wanted. But at Spartan Stadium, 
against an upstart team looking 
for an upset, the Wolverines 
took the win, and the trophy, 
regardless.

“We came in here expecting 

to get it back,” Speight said. “It 
wasn’t like a surprise.”

Sonya 
Rodolfo-Sioson, 

Miya’s mother, spoke before the 
screening about the moments 
following 
the 
shooting. 
Her 

daughter had been a student at 
the university and was working 
as receptionist when the shooter 
entered a conference room full 
of professors with a .38-caliber 
revolver and shot the associate 
vice 
president 
for 
academic 

affairs before turning the gun 
on Rodolfo-Sioson. She survived 
the gunshot to the throat, but 
was rendered paralyzed from the 
neck down.

“We didn’t know whether she 

wished that he had killed her, 
or whether she wanted to live 
damaged,” she said. “I could just 
see her going through this time: 
‘OK that door shut, that door shut, 
what can I still do?’ And at the 
very end, she said she could still 
be an activist.”

The shooter, former graduate 

student Gang Lu, opened fire 
on the conference room in 
frustration 
over 
losing 
the 

prestigious D.C Spriestersbach 
Dissertation Prize in physics to 
a rival student. Miya Rodolfo-
Sioson survived after she was 
shot by Lu at her receptionist’s 
desk. 

Sonya 
Rodolfo-Sioson 

emphasized 
Miya’s 
resilience 

following 
her 
injury, 
which 

included continuing her activism 
in 
areas 
such 
as 
disability 

rights, 
humanitarian 
causes 

and women’s rights through her 
work for the Women’s Resource 
Action Center, the Rape Crisis 
Center and the Battered Women’s 
Shelter.

“When she came back (from 

rehab), she said ‘I can help the 
formatting of newsletters, I can 
help spread the word.’ And it 
continued on from there.”

Miya al story included her fight 

against breast cancer, diagnosed 
16 years after the shooting. 
Her mother said it was due to 
her weakened immune system, 
which is often a side effect in 
quadriplegics.

“I was thinking she was going 

to live to be 50,” she said. “A lot of 
people in the disabled community 
live to be 50 as long as they had 
support. Well, she was 39 years 
old and inflammatory breast 
cancer had set in.”

She said despite this challenge, 

Miya continued to fight for the 
causes that were most important 
to 
her 
while 
simultaneously 

getting treated for her cancer.

“She still kept on going, she 

still kept on attending rallies, 
protesting against injustice, and 
then she would have to go and get 
chemo,” she said.

Miya 
passed 
away 
just 

before her 41st birthday in 
2008. Anderson said despite 
the efforts of the University of 
Iowa and other communities 
to commemorate the shooting 
over the years, she believed the 
memory of it was disappearing.

“With the 25-year anniversary 

(of 
the 
shooting) 
and 
the 

connection to the theme that 
we have this year, I thought, 
‘Somebody needs to do this,’ ” 
she said. “We don’t want the 25th 
anniversary to go by without 
somebody remembering.”

LSA 
senior 
Abbie 
Bowen, 

the only University student in 
attendance, said she admired 
Miya’s perseverance in the face of 
overwhelming adversity.

“I thought her story was very 

inspiring,” she said. “It was very 
good to see that even though she 
was a quadriplegic, to get out 
and still have a life and be very 
active.”

Bowen said she attended the 

event because her organization, 
PULSE, designated this event 
as one of its training institutes 
required for members.

PULSE 
is 
a 
student-run, 

UHS-sponsored 
organization 

promoting health, wellness and 
social justice around campus 
through peer interactions and 
events. 

Sonya said there are many 

aspects of Miya’s story that 
college students can learn from, 
noting that in the face of what 
Miya went through after her 
injury, she still found a way to 
keep going. 

“You can always keep going, 

no matter what happens to you,” 
she said. “You don’t have to let 
you get you down. If I could keep 
going without even the ability to 
brush my teeth or feed myself, so 
can you. That is the message that 
(Miya’s) life tells.”

contrast with their opponents, 
who have built their campaign on 
dividing people. Clinton and Kaine 
will truly live up to their motto of 
‘Stronger Together.’ ”

During his speech in Taylor, 

Kaine also discussed the Clinton 
campaign’s 
economic 
policies, 

outlining their four-pillar plan. 
He 
highlighted 
in 
particular 

the campaign’s plan to invest in 
manufacturing, 
infrastructure 

and research, improve education, 
raise wages and close corporate 

tax loopholes. During his speech 
later later that night in Warren, 
Kaine addressed similar economic 
concerns to a crowd largely made 
up of UAW workers.

In Taylor, Kaine said the 

campaign’s economic plan would 
grow the economy and more 
equitably distribute its benefits. 

“Many 
economists 
are 
in 

agreement that our economic 
policies would grow the economy 
by adding 10 and a half million jobs 
by the end of the first year,” Kaine 
said, prompting applause from 
the crowd. “The Trump plan, in 
contrast, is estimated to shrink the 
American economy by three and a 

half million jobs.”

In 
Taylor, 
Kaine 
also 

emphasized that the results of 
the early and absentee voting are 
trending positively for the Clinton 
campaign, noting he has a proven 
record of success in elections.

“In states with robust early and 

absentee voting we are seeing good 
results so far,” Kaine said. “The 
turnout has been tremendous, 
in particular, in states that we 
are targeting like Ohio, Florida, 
Pennsylvania and North Carolina 
… The good thing for us is that I 
don’t lose elections, even though I 
don’t win by a lot.”

arrest in this country,” he said.

Working with a comprehensive 

team of cardiologists and health 
care workers, Sinha’s project 
aimed to address gaps in the 
current evidence and literature 
in the field. After many months, 
he said his team designed a 
comprehensive 
systematic 

review of randomized control 
trials, that has included 65,000 
patients to date, for immediate 
treatments of cardiac arrest. 

Sinha 
said 
there 
are 
25 

to 86 times more published 
clinical trials for other diseases, 
including 
heart 
attacks 
and 

stroke.

“What we found here was 

an opportunity to try to better 
understand how we prioritize 
what the research needs are, to 
meet the public health burden of 
disease,” Sinha said.

He said the deficiency in 

research partly speaks to the 
availability of funding, systems 
for reporting results and the 
overall design of the studies.

In particular, Sinha’s team 

found a significant lack of focus 
on in-hospital cardiac arrests, 
happening more than 200,000 
times a year. Despite their 
prevalence, there were only 
four randomized control trials 
over 20 years that looked at this 
particular patient population.

“I think part of the challenge 

is 
recognizing 
where 
the 

opportunities are, strategically, 
to 
help 
optimize 
the 
care 

for these very high risk and 
vulnerable patients,” Sinha said.

Internal 
Medicine 
Prof. 

Brahmajee 
Nallamothu, 

cardiologist for the University 
and the Ann Arbor Veterans 
Affairs 
Medical 
Center 
and 

co-author of the study, said the 
study 
of 
in-hospital 
cardiac 

arrests remains difficult, serving 
as an obstacle in developing 
effective treatments.

“The question is how can 

we change our model for how 
we study this condition, and 
how we can do things that 
will be meaningful in terms of 
evaluating therapies that could 
help,” Nallamothu said. “It’s 
tough in two ways — it’s tough 
because it’s hard to study, and 
then it’s a tough problem in 
terms of finding solutions.

Though past research has 

primarily focused on survival 
numbers, Sinha’s team aimed to 
shift that paradigm by looking 
more at the patient’s quality of 
life after cardiac arrest.

“I think the goals for our 

systematic 
review 
was 
to 

help 
inform 
the 
literature 

about whether it is possible to 
standardize how we measure 
the outcomes of care and focus… 
more 
on 
patient-centered 

outcomes, 
like 
returning 
to 

work, or having a reasonable 
quality of life, as opposed to 

simply whether they survive,” he 
said.

Nallamothu also emphasized 

providing 
more 
effective 

education 
on 
immediate 

treatments for cardiac arrest, 
like a CPR outreach event 
fellow project member Robert 
Neumar, an emergency medicine 
professor, held at a Department 
of Emergency Medicine tailgate 
last year where a video was 
played of team members giving 
CPR demonstrations.

“I think for me, the message 

to the community is always to 
try to improve education around 
basic life support and CPR,” 
Nallamothu 
said. 
“Bystander 

CPR is so critical to outcomes, 
that as well as early access to 
AEDs. Those are two community 
based solutions.”

Sinha said the research he is 

conducting should help lead to 
standardization and eventual 
accreditation of hospital care 
for immediate cardiac arrest 
treatment, 
like 
the 
current 

existing methods for stroke and 
heart attack.

“I think we’re still several 

years removed from that, but I 
hope that our study helps guide 
resuscitation research on where 
the priorities should be,” he said.

He said his team also hopes to 

galvanize interest from national 
organizations in the United 
States on this area of research 
because most trials on cardiac 
arrest have been done outside 
the country.

lives than a public relations 
maneuver of saying ‘we’re going 
to tackle the Packard Plant,’ ” 
Thompson said.

Some students, such as Art 

& Design junior Arica Cykiert, 
said they are also worried 
Detroit will lose a cornerstone 
of its cultural and artistic 
value. 
Cykiert 
has 
studied 

street art during her time at the 
University. 

“Graffiti 
is, 
most 
often, 

an 
opportunity 
for 
people 

who find their environment 
oppressive to respond to it,” 
Cykiert said. “I understand that 
to many it represents a culture 
out of control, but to so many 
more it represents hope and 
optimism, especially in a city 
so economically depressed as 
Detroit.”

Ann Arbor resident Mary 

Thiefels, founder and owner 
of TreeTown Murals — a 
mural art company based in 
Ann Arbor — said she believes 
that graffiti being produced in 

Detroit is critical for the city 
to allow these young artists a 
space in which they can express 
themselves.

“I cannot condone illegal 

graffiti in my line of profession, 
but I do support the human 
desire to leave our mark that 
graffiti culture has done such 
a great job of encouraging,” 
Thiefels said. “I support that 
desire to leave our mark, but at 
the same time I don’t encourage 
young people to vandalize or 
trespass.”

While this push for the 

elimination of graffiti is an 
effort to reinvigorate the city, 
some, such as Antonio Cosme, 
founding member of the Raiz 
Up Collective of Detroit, a 
neighborhood 
collective 
of 

Southwest 
Detroit 
residents 

that use hip-hop as a tool to 
create social awareness, feels it 
is a declaration of war against 
art and the creative spirit of the 
city.

“This is art we’re talking 

about,” Cosme said. “This is not 
the War on Drugs. This is the 
war on art that’s taking place in 
Detroit.”

Painting over the graffiti 

is not the first step in their 
efforts to reduce the presence 
of vandals at the site. In the 
past, the city’s attempts to 
increase the value of the plant 
have been thwarted by the 
continual appearance of street 
artists. In an attempt to combat 
the frequent tagging, the city 
began reconstructing the plant 
to make it more secure.

Jessica Parker, the graffiti 

removal 
project 
manager 

through 
Detroit’s 
General 

Services Department, said in an 
interview with the Detroit Free 
Press that the plant is among 
several historic ‘graffiti havens,’ 
from around the city that will 
be cleaned as part of a city-wide 
initiative to increase the overall 
well-being of Detroit and its 
inhabitants. 

“We’re trying to remove the 

idea that the city is in disarray 
because 
we’re 
making 
a 

comeback and we’re doing it one 
block at a time, we’re removing 
one tag at a time,” Parker said. 
“And we’re trying to restore the 
hope back into the community 
that the city of Detroit, we are 
here, we’re building and we’re 
on our way back up.”

A 

month ago, a guy at a 
party turned to me and 
said, “I don’t know your 

name, so I’m going to call you 
sugar tits.” Just three weeks ago, 
a recording of Donald Trump 
lauding his power to grab women 
“by the pussy” surfaced. One in 
four women on college campuses 
are survivors of sexual assault. It 
is frustratingly clear that gender 
inequalities persist in our world.

When I express this frustration 

to women a generation or two 
older than me, they often respond 
by reminding me how much 
more power I have than they did 
at my age. I am usually irritated 
at these responses, uncertain 
how to reconcile my anger with 
appreciation for the privileges I 
have in this generation. An event 
hosted by the LSA Human Rights 
Program last week addressed 
this tension, and emphasized that 
anger can productively coexist 
with appreciation for past success.

The Human Rights Program’s 

distinguished lecture event Oct. 
11 featured Kathryn Sikkink, 
a 
renowned 
professor 
and 

researcher 
of 
human 
rights. 

Sikkink’s presentation highlighted 
a paradoxical characteristic of 
the human rights movement: 
The more we mobilize to combat 
human rights violations, the more 
dismal the situation appears. She 
attributes this feature of the human 
rights movement to three things: 
First, the more data gathered 
about a human rights violation, 
the more prominent that violation 
may seem. Second, as activists and 
organizations succeed in securing 
more human rights, the standard 
of accountability rises. And third, 
a focus on suffering is integral to 
human rights movements because 
dismissal of suffering may appear 
callous and would do little to 
motivate change.

Consequently, 
the 
dialogue 

surrounding 
human 
rights 

movements and institutions is 

often pessimistic. Sikkink argued 
that while negativity may be 
inherent in human rights advocacy, 
unchecked pessimism is corrosive 
to the human rights agenda. 
Quoting Saul Alinsky, Sikkink 
emphasized 
that 
successful 

activism requires three things: 
anger, hope and action. The anger 
portion of this trifecta, Sikkink 
argued, is highlighted in human 
rights activism, while the hope 
portion is often underemphasized. 
Without evidence that our actions 
have been successful, we risk 
losing hope that change is possible.

Her words reminded me of 

my 
grandmother’s 
standard 

response to my frustration with 
gender inequality: “I know you’re 
frustrated, but you are forgetting 
how far we have come.” Just as 
Sikkink’s work seeks to remind 
human rights advocates of their 
success, elder feminists remind 
women of my generation that 
women’s rights movements have 
been successful. Remembering to 
recognize success, however, can 
be challenging.

I 
am 
angry 
that 
women 

hold only 19.4 percent of U.S. 
Congressional seats. Yet in less 
than 100 years, women in this 
country have progressed from 
having 
no 
representation 
in 

government to likely reaching one 
of the most powerful leadership 
positions 
in 
the 
world. 
By 

advocating for women’s suffrage in 
the early 1900s, the International 
Women’s 
Suffrage 
Alliance, 

along with other organizations, 
fought long and hard to free 
women “from the thraldom [sic] 
of the centuries.” The struggle to 
expand political representation 
for women continues today, but 
is made possible by the success of 
past struggles. 

I am angry at the frequency 

with which demeaning comments 
challenge 
women’s 
autonomy. 

I am angry that one-fourth of 
women on college campuses are 
sexually assaulted. I am angry 
that a judge granted Brock Turner 
a lenient sentence based on the 
ironic argument that, “A prison 

sentence would have a severe 
impact on him.”

Sexual violence is a persistent 

problem in many ways, but we are 
making progress in combatting it. 
Sikkink presented a graph which 
displays Sweden as the country 
with the highest occurrence of 
rape in the world. Until recently, 
sexual violence wasn’t a public 
issue. Efforts to monitor the 
prevalence of sexual violence 
weren’t prominent and data wasn’t 
collected. Now, human rights 
movements and women’s rights 
organizations have successfully 
demanded that sexual violence 
become 
a 
public 
issue, 

necessitating 
data 
collection, 

discussion 
and 
advocacy 
for 

change. Documentation of sexual 
violence on college campuses, 
in our country and around the 
world, demonstrates a change in 
public attitudes and priority given 
to the issue. While sexual assault 
statistics rightfully prompt anger, 
they also inspire hope because an 
open discussion has been sparked.

There is much work to be 

done before we can stop being 
angered by underrepresentation of 
women in politics, by demeaning 
comments made by college boys 
and 
presidential 
candidates 

and by the prevalence of sexual 
violence. But just as anger is 
necessary to motivate action, so is 
an understanding of the successes 
of advocacy. As we work toward 
gender equality, let us not only 
focus on frustratingly persistent 
inequalities. We must also remain 
hopeful for future progress by 
remembering the successes of past 
movements and the strength of 
current advocacy.

Next time you find yourself 

responding to a man that replaces 
your name with “sugar tits,” be 
angry enough to voice your anger, 
and be hopeful that comments 
such as these will become less 
frequent as a strong feminist 
movement continues to identify 
and address gender inequalities.

A 
student 
or 
professor 

strolling our campus might 
conclude that key figures in 
the development and funding 
of 
this 
institution 
were 

primarily men of European 
origin. That may be the case, 
but there is much more to the 
story. For a century and a half, 
women and people of color 
have earned degrees here and 
played a role in the University 
of Michigan’s growth. And 
many white men associated 
with the University took then-
unpopular stands supporting 
the rights of minorities. As 
the University celebrates both 
diversity and its bicentennial, 
consideration 
might 
be 

given 
to 
commemorating 

women, minorities and those 
who 
promoted 
equitable 

opportunities. 
Prominent 

historical 
markers 
or 

plaques might highlight the 
accomplishments of some of 
the following:

Father Gabriel Richard — A 

key figure in the development 
of Detroit, he joined with Chief 
Justice Augusts Woodward to 
establish the Catholepistimead 
that became this University. 
In 1817, the Chippewa, Ottawa 
and 
Potawatomi 
surrendered 

their land to Michigan territory 
with an agreement that their 
children be educated at the 
schools in Detroit Father Richard 
established. As a result, Michigan 
Native Americans are exempt 
from tuition at this university.

Amanda Sanford — became 

the first woman to graduate 
from the University’s medical 
school in 1871. She furthered 
her medical studies in London 
and Paris and then practiced in 
upstate New York.

Sarah 
Wertman 
— 
She 

graduated from the law school 
in 1871 and became the first 
woman in the United States 
to both earn a legal degree 
and be admitted to the bar in 
Michigan. In that era, many 
states refused to admit women 
to the bar. She was an early 
participant in the Equity Club, 
the first national organization 
of women lawyers and a group 
founded in Ann Arbor.

William Henry Fitzbutler — In 

1872, he became the first African 
American to graduate from the 
Medical School. He practiced 
medicine 
in 
Louisville 
and 

obtained support from Kentucky 
to establish a medical school that 
would admit Blacks. He founded 
and then served as head of the 
National 
Medical 
College 
in 

Louisville, a school that graduated 
150 Black physicians and was 
praised in the Flexner Report.

Moses Fleetwood Walker — 

While earning his law degree 
here, he was the catcher for the 
baseball team in 1882 hitting 
.308. He played professional 
baseball for six years and was 
the last African American to play 
for a minor league baseball team 
until the 1940s.

Branch Rickey — He was 

appointed baseball coach in 1910. 
He earned a law degree in his 
four years in Ann Arbor and then 
became a distinguished baseball 
executive. In the 1940s, baseball 
was the national pastime. Branch 
Rickey successfully overturned 
Jim Crow policies when he 
recruited Jackie Robinson to play 
for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. 
This was among the important 
changes of the post-World War 
II that laid the foundation for the 
Civil Rights Movement.

Jesse Owens — As a member 

of the Ohio State track team, 
Owens set three world records 
— and tied one — within 45 
minutes at Ferry Field on May 
25, 1935. This feat was never 
duplicated. His achievements 
in the Berlin Olympics made 
him the first African-American 
athlete to be seen as a national 
sports hero.

Raoul Wallenberg — This 

Swedish student enrolled in 
the architecture program at 
Michigan in the 1930s. After 

the Germans overran European 
nations, they sought to incarcerate 
Jews. Wallenberg is credited with 
saving thousands of Hungarian 
Jews during the Holocaust.

James Earl Jones — Jones, 

from the Jackson area, came to 
Michigan in the 1950s intending 
to become a physician but 
discovered his talents in the 
performing arts. He enrolled 
in the School of Music and 
went on to became one of the 
nation’s most acclaimed actors, 
winning Tony Awards in 1969 
and 1987 and a Golden Globe 
Award in 1970.

Jessye Norman — She earned a 

master’s degree from the School 
of Music, Theater & Dance in 
1968 and then went to Europe 
to begin her illustrious career 
as an opera singer and recitalist. 
She has, perhaps, performed in 
more operas and in more venues 
than any of her peers and won 
great accolades for her voice, her 
theatrical accomplishments and 
her philanthropy.

Madonna (Louise Ciccone) — 

This artist enrolled as a student 
in the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance in 1976. She left 
Michigan shortly thereafter to 
begin her extremely successful 
career as a singer, actress, 
composer and businesswoman.

Derek 
Jeter 
— 
This 

Kalamazoo resident enrolled as 
a student in 1992 but then opted 
for a career in professional 
baseball. For 20 years, he was 
the most talented and reliable 
shortstop in the Major Leagues 
while leading the New York 
Yankees to the World Series 
seven times.

Michigan historical markers 

are permanent, highly visible and 
easy to maintain. They provide 
space for an explanation of the 
person and could include a QR 
where 
additional 
information 

would 
be 
available. 
Without 

substantial cost or bureaucratic 
effort, historical markers could 
bring the diverse history of the 
University of Michigan to the 
attention of today’s students, 
staff and visitors — and to those 
who will be walking across this 
campus in forthcoming centuries.

E

arlier this month, the U.S. 
Environmental Protection 
Agency admitted it should 

have acted seven months earlier 
in the Flint water crisis, which 
began in April 2014 and is ongoing. 
Lead poisoning and outbreaks 
of bacterial diseases following 
the city’s switch to the Flint 
River as its water source have 
had lasting, irreversible impacts 
to 
human 
health. 
President 

Obama has said, “I know that if 
I was a parent up there, I would 
be beside myself that my kids’ 
health could be at risk.”

Just before Fall Break, I tried to 

defend a creative policy response 
to the Flint water crisis to my Ford 
School of Public Policy classmates. 
The idea is simple: What if the 
government paid residents to move 
to healthier, more economically 
viable 
surrounding 
cities, 
in 

addition to repairing the necessary 
water infrastructure?

Before laying out the arguments 

and evidence underpinning the 
idea, I need to admit I quite clearly 
failed to convince my classmates. 
I pointed to research about 
neighborhood effects, and how the 
government routinely “nudges” 
individuals 
to 
achieve 
better 

outcomes for themselves and their 
communities. My arguments relied 
on the belief that, as individuals, 
we’re “rational economic agents,” 
processing information well and 
assigning prices (i.e., values) to 
the everyday things in our lives. 
To my classmates-turned-critics, 
I failed to consider many of the 
relationships, expectations and 
principles that form a good life.

One complaint with the idea 

was that justice requires much 
more than our government writing 
a check. Water is a basic human 
right according to the U.N. Our 
government has a responsibility to 
meet basic water needs, and failed. 
The government must right the 
wrong on principle; questions of 
cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness 
are irrelevant. Another complaint 
is that such a policy fails to respect 

the rights of individuals, that 
they’d be coerced into moving.

Perhaps the most damning 

rejoinder is that such a policy 
neglects, or fails to account for, 
the value of personal experience, 
communal connections and a 
sense of home. At risk of stating 
the obvious, where we are and 
who we interact with influence 
our happiness and satisfaction. 
The fact that local stakeholders 
have worked tirelessly in Flint 
during the crisis demonstrates 
the importance of these ties 
and interactions to residents. 
Furthermore, 
even 
if 
the 

amount paid to individuals 
reflects this value, can we 
really 
be 
confident 
that 

individuals 
calculate 
their 

own values appropriately when 
taking the cash? We’re all 
guilty of wishful thinking and 
acting irrationally.

My classmates were right 

to be initially skeptical. But 
the 
reasons 
supporting 
the 

rational, cost-benefit-calculating 
economist’s 
policy 
are 
also 

intriguing. Here’s why:

Families 
that 
move 
would 

immediately get what they need 
most: safe, reliable and unlimited 
access to water. Their kids would 
be in better schools immediately, 
without 
the 
uncertainty 
of 

whether their school was safe, 
or whether it might close in the 
coming year. Flint’s schools are still 
failing its students, according to a 
lawsuit filed by the ACLU earlier 
this month. And working parents 
could enter a local economy with 
better job prospects and pay. 
Seminal work by Harvard and 
University of California-Berkeley 
economists have documented that 
Flint, Genesee and Wayne County 
have among the lowest levels 
of economic opportunity and 
mobility in Michigan.

Moving residents could help 

rebuild their trust in institutions, 
which is in short supply among 
Flint residents after years of 
environmental and institutional 
racism. The New York Times 
wrote earlier this month that 
many of the first residents to have 
the pipes to their homes replaced 

continue to use bottled water, 
even after being told the tap was 
OK to use. Economic research 
clearly links higher levels of trust 
in institutions to more human 
development and faster economic 
growth. Paying residents to move 
might help repair this damage.

Economic outcomes could also 

be better in the long run, especially 
for families with young children. 
New evidence from the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban 
Development-sponsored Moving 
to Opportunity experiment, a 
longitudinal 
program 
starting 

in 1994 that resettled residents 
of poor communities in more 
affluent areas, illuminates the 
extent to which location affects 
health and economic outcomes. 
Individuals who moved before 
their 13th birthday, as a result of 
experimental treatment, earned 
31 
percent 
more 
than 
their 

counterparts who did not move. 

It could also be cost effective. 

President Obama is right in that, 
“It’s not enough just to fix the 
water.” The educational, health 
and economic costs of the crisis 
will be enormous. Dispersing 
families 
and 
students 
could 

drive down the educational costs 
associated with lead poisoning and 
lost school hours. And the costs of 
children falling behind in school, 
even for those unaffected by lead 
poisoning, 
likely 
dwarf 
what 

might be spent on infrastructure: 
Students who have fallen behind 
and fail to recover will likely earn 
less on average each year than they 
otherwise would have. This math 
gets scary, quickly.

Questions about how the policy 

could be introduced (e.g., when, 
at what cost, and for whom) raise 
other practical issues, drawbacks 
and ethical concerns. I’d feel 
entirely different about the idea if 
it turned out certain demographic 
groups 
respond 
adversely, 
or 

even less favorably, to moving to 
opportunity. But don’t we owe 
Flint residents ambitious, creative, 
“moonshot”-like policy solutions?

FILM REVIEW

Conspiracy theories are an end-

lessly fascinating phenomenon of 
the collective psyche and the per-
suasive power of 
rhetoric. The Holo-
caust denial move-
ment of the 1980s 
stands as an epit-
ome of this binary 
between truth and 
fiction. Zooming in 
on the contention 
between a Holo-
caust historian and 
a Holocaust denier, 
Mick Jackson’s new film “Denial” 
attempts, unsuccessfully, to por-
tray the struggle and consequenc-
es of holding up outlandish and 
baseless comments in court — a 
trial relevant and relatable given 
our current political climate.

“Denial” attempts to tell the 

real story of the 1996 court battle 
between Holocaust and Jewish 
studies professor at Emory Uni-
versity Deborah Lipstadt (Rachel 
Weisz, 
“The 
Light 
Between 

Oceans”) and infamous Holocaust 
denier David Irving (Timothy 
Spall, “Sweeney Todd”). After 
being taken to court by Irving in 
a British libel suit, Lipstadt must 
defend an allegation she made 
in one of her books: that Irving 
intentionally manipulated his-
torical evidence to claim that the 
Holocaust was a conspiracy theo-
ry enacted by the Jews to garner 
international support.

This character binary between 

symbols of truth and fiction works 
as a driving force throughout the 
film. Weisz does a commend-
able job portraying Lipstadt as a 
steadfast, determined and strong 
woman committed to her academ-

ic field and Jewish 
heritage; her char-
acter is likable, and 
her frustrations are 
easy to sympathize 
with. Spall, on the 
other hand, is his 
usual 
repulsive 

self, 
aesthetically 

and characteristi-
cally. Despite his 
character’s poten-

tial to offer insight into the twist-
ed mind of a conspiracy theorist, 
Spall spends the entire film sniv-
eling and strutting around with 
hesitant pomposity. His short-
comings combine to construct a 
one-dimensional antagonist that 
offers an off-balance challenge to 
the strength of Weisz.

The film is also horribly bal-

anced in terms of emotion, lacking 
gravity where it is badly needed 
and placing stress in high doses 
where it is unnecessary. For exam-
ple, the first face-off between 
Lipstadt and Irving works as the 
perfect opportunity to lay out 
the contention between the two. 
Instead, the scene is childish and 
anxiety-inducing, 
culminating 

in a stressful and chaotic bout 
of incoherent shouting. On the 
other end of the spectrum, the 
legal team’s trip to Auschwitz 
lacks the necessary emotion and 

gravity of the space. “Denial” 
attempts the ambitious task of 
capturing the emotional weight of 
Auschwitz with long establishing 
shots of snow-covered barracks 
and an absence of an overlaying 
score. However, the scene lacks 
significant emotion; lawyer Rich-
ard Rampton’s (Tom Wilkinson, 
“Selma”) casual treatment of the 
camp as a crime scene, while a 
narrative plot point, reinforces the 
film’s incapability to capture the 
complex and raw despair of the 
space.

The most frustrating aspect 

of the film is the way in which it 
emphasizes and builds binaries 
that take away from the central 
conflict. The film focuses mainly 
on the contentions between Lip-
stadt and her lawyer Anthony 
Julius (Andrew Scott, “Sherlock”). 
Throughout the film, the two are 
constantly arguing about strat-
egy and morality, with countless 
scenes of them bickering and get-
ting nowhere. Scott also somehow 
always looks wet, which is confus-
ing and unpleasant.

The film’s focus on the binary 

between the passionate but impul-
sive professor and the calculated 
but cold lawyer takes away from 
the real issues of the Holocaust 
denial movement — the way in 
which conspiracy theories mani-
fest and take hold, and its implica-
tions on the academic community 
and the public. Instead, “Denial” 
is completely aggravating and dis-
appointing; the viewer gains zero 
insight into the deeper issues of 
the real-life phenomenon.

TV REVIEW

There’s sketch comedy, and 

then there’s bad sketch comedy. 
Then, there’s really bad sketch 
comedy. Beneath all that is 
“Tracey 
Ullman’s 

Show.” 
The 
BBC 

program, 
which 

originally aired in 
the U.K. in January 
2015, debuted on 
HBO Friday night. 
The 
30-minute 

romp 
explores 

British 
culture, 

pokes fun at its 
most 
prominent 

leaders and satirizes 
current 
events. 

Thirty years earlier, 
this would have been a recipe for 
comedic gold – and it was. “Tracey 
Ullman’s Show” is the comedian’s 
first major broadcast project since 
her wild, wacky and incredibly 
influential “The Tracey Ullman 
Show” in the late 1980s. 

Unfortunately, this is not 1987. 

Today’s viewers have access to 
endless sketch comedy, from 
“Saturday Night Live” to “Broad 
City” to the video their cousin 
Maggie made with some friends 
from her improv troupe in 
Chicago. Viewers expect witty, 
weird and wholehearted sketch 
comedy. Compared to the content 
produced today, “Tracey Ullman’s 
Show” is trite.

To her credit, Ullman is an 

incredible 
impressionist. 
She 

pulls off her impersonations 
with such ease and confidence 
that it’s possible to forget she is 
not the real subject. The pilot 
episode features several sketches 
about a “misbehaving Dame 
Judy Dench.” From blatantly 
stealing at the grocery store to 
defacing the tablet of co-star 
Rupert Grint (The “Harry Potter” 
series), Dame Judy Dench tests 
how far she can take being 
Britain’s national treasure. It’s so 
believable that those who aren’t 
that familiar with Dench (myself, 
for example) might not realize 
it’s an impression until after the 
episode ends.

Other impressions include 

German 
Chancellor 
Angela 

Merkel and Dame Maggie Smith. 

Each sketch put the women in 
interesting situations — Smith 
filming an audition tape for sci-fi 
movies, and Merkel throwing a 
tantrum on a private plane. The 
acting is calculated and focused. 
Ullman 
has 
great 
comedic 

timing and a strong presence on 

camera.

But 
the 

problem 
with 

“Tracey Ullman’s 
Show” 
is 
not 

her acting, it’s 
the 
sketches 

themselves. 
The 
writing 

is 
unoriginal, 

and the humor 
in each sketch 
is 
predictable. 

One 
storyline 

which stands out 

in particular is that of Karen, a 
recently released prisoner who 
returns home for the first time 
in 28 years. The “joke” of the 
piece lies in Karen’s discomfort 
with life outside of prison, and 
the changes that have occurred 
since her imprisonment. For 
such a seasoned comic, this 
premise is a rudimentary excuse 
for humor. The worst part of it, 
however, was the employment 
of the “rule of threes.” Time and 
time again, if Karen sees or hears 
of something new, she needs to 
hear its name three times before 
she understands. The repetition is 
just not funny.

Use of techniques such as 

the “rule of threes” belittles the 
viewer. By its nature it’s silly 
and fun, but sketch comedy can 
do more than that. It can incite 
conversation and respect the 
viewer enough to trust that they 
can handle more than the “rule 
of threes.” No part of “Tracey 
Ullman’s Show” inspires thought, 
or evokes emotion. It’s simply 30 
minutes of tired jokes and curated 
impressions.

It’s disappointing to see a 

strong female comedian in what 
could potentially be the role(s) 
of her career fall short. Tracey 
Ullman is clearly talented. She is 
funny. But her show isn’t. It might 
have a different effect on older 
audiences — those who grew 
up watching and laughing with 
Tracey Ullman might think the 
program is prime comedy. Maybe 

it’s unfair to call it based off of the 
pilot episode. As of now, though, 
the 30-minute pilot is 25 minutes 
too long.

Lights, camera, IGGY! Punk 

rock icon James “Iggy Pop” 
Osterberg 
took 
the 
Detroit 

Institute of Arts by storm this 
past Tuesday to promote the new 
Stooges 
documentary 
“Gimme 

Danger.” The juxtaposition of punk 
rock vibes among the elegance of 
the renowned art museum set the 
stage for the sold-out event, as an 
eclectic mix of individuals poured 
into the theater eager for the film.

“I’m surprised they let the 

Stooges in here,” said director 
Jim Jarmusch (“Stranger Than 
Paradise”).

But no matter the oddity of the 

location, the Michigan premiere 
was a remarkable testament to 
the Stooges, a motley crew of 
Midwestern men who in 1967 
found their sound in Ann Arbor.

Before the film started, we 

made our way up to Rivera court. 
There, shadowed by a mural of 
hard-working automotive industry 
men, a small red carpet was graced 
by Iggy Pop and Jim Jarmusch. 
In true rock ‘n’ roll fashion, the 
men arrived 20 minutes late. The 
court buzzed with excitement 
while Iggy and Jarmusch posed 
for 
photos. 
Noteworthy 
was 

Jarmusch’s suggestion to Iggy that 
they “do the Zoolander face.” Even 
more noteworthy was how well 
they pulled the look off.

Soon after, the group migrated 

to the theater and waited for the 
film to begin. To say the crowd 
was excited is an understatement. 
The moment Iggy walked on 
stage, hordes of audience members 
sprang to their feet, exuberant 
to be in the presence of a living 
legend.

The 
film 
is 
a 
fascinating 

108-minute 
journey 
through 

the Stooges’ past, present and 
future. It’s stylistically brilliant 
and 
reflective 
of 
the 
band’s 

offbeat humor, morals and music. 
Jarmusch, the famous champion 
of 
independent 
cinema, 
took 

what could be a run-of-the-mill 
documentary on an iconic band 
and turned it into a love letter to 
the artists who created and the 
fans who followed punk rock. It’s 

a documentary that doesn’t take 
itself too seriously, just like the 
Stooges.

The film chronicles the band’s 

humble beginnings in Ann Arbor. 
To view footage and photographs 
that are practically undiscovered 
of Ann Arbor in the late 1960s was 
especially special for those who 
knew the town. At one point, Iggy 
recounted the night the Stooges 
became a “professional” band and 
were signed to Elektra Records. 
Along with MC5, they were 
performing in what is known today 
as the Michigan Union Ballroom. 
As students, watching footage of 
history made in the same room 
where we go to mass meetings was 
surreal.

Fittingly, surrealism is a theme 

throughout the film. To depict 
events which lack actual footage, 
Jarmusch uses animations. The 
addition of these animations brings 
life to old stories, though it’s not as 
if the stories needed much help. 
One in particular stands out – how 
the band got its name – born out of 
a joke that the members were like 
“The Three Stooges.” When they 
were officially signed by Elektra 
Records, guitarist Ron Asheton 
called Moe Howard, the leader 
of the Three Stooges, to check if 
using the Stooge name was okay. 
Howard’s response, according to 
Asheton: “I don’t give a fuck what 
you call your band, as long as it’s 
not the Three Stooges.”

As the film came to a close, the 

stage was set up for a Q&A session 
with Osterberg and Jarmusch, 
who took the stage with roaring 
applause from the audience. The 
first half of the Q&A began with 
questions from a moderator, prying 
deeper into the details of the film, 
and more importantly, the details 
about the Stooges’ connection to 
Ann Arbor.

When asked about how he 

selected the people he interviewed 
for the film, Jarmusch gave a 
simple answer: he wanted the 
documentary to be as personal 
as possible. He limited it to the 
Stooges and their family, with little 
material from outside sources. 
He even admitted to passing up 
on interviewing David Bowie, 
because he knew he couldn’t resist 
putting the footage in the film. 
Jarmusch displays a startling 

amount of discipline in his craft, 
keeping the film as intimate to the 
Stooges as possible.

Throughout, the two had a 

lighthearted bond, giving relaxed 
answers to what could be serious 
questions. The moderator asked 
Osterberg if he had any input on 
the film, to which he replied, “If 
Jim asked me to write a song about 
him, I wouldn’t expect him to tell 
me how to write it.” It was pretty 
awesome to see such an important 
icon be able to put so much faith 
in the man capturing the band’s 
career on the silver screen.

It became very apparent during 

the session why Osterberg chose 
Jarmusch to direct the film. When 
asked about his connection to 
punk rock, Osterberg replied as 
I’d expect any punk to: the Stooges 
made “working class, ass-kicking 
rock ‘n’ roll and it spoke to me.” 
It was the perfect testament to 
the timelessness of rock ‘n’ roll. 
Over 40 years later, the fans’ 
relationship with the genre has not 
changed a bit.

The Q&A truly shone when 

Osterberg began to talk about 
his time in Ann Arbor. The film 
included multiple shots of him 
and the band on notable locations 
around campus, and the way 
Osterberg spoke about it showed 
his deep appreciation for the town. 
He spoke of the house on Hill 
Street where they first signed to 
Elektra Records. He talked about 
John Sinclair and The White 
Panthers and the little postcards 
they gave out to people on the 
streets. He reflected fondly on the 
revolutionary “hotbed” that was 
Ann Arbor throughout the `60s and 
`70s. The little details about Ann 
Arbor embedded in Osterberg’s 
memory were a beautiful tribute 
to the city where he grew up and 
where punk rock has some of its 
oldest roots.

It was a night of nostalgia come 

full circle to the present. No matter 
how much time has passed since 
that fateful night in the Union 
Ballroom in Ann Arbor, Iggy will 
always be special to punk rock and 
punk rock will always be special 
to its fans. In Jarmusch’s words, 
“look what they gave and look 
how they were treated.” Finally, 
the Stooges got the thank you they 
deserve with “Gimme Danger.”

EVENT REVIEW


LIONSGATE FILMS

Boo!

“Boo! A Madea Halloween” is 

the worst comedy of 2016, thus far. 
No other movie of the genre, not 
even Melissa McCarthy’s godawful 
career nadir, “The 
Boss,” has featured 
such 
a 
staggering 

lack of laughter, such 
unlikeable 
charac-

ters and such an idi-
otic story. No other 
movie of any genre, 
short of “Norm of the 
North,” has turned 
a runtime of less 
than two hours into 
such a cross for its viewers to bear. 
Whether it’s in its comedy, horror 
homages or writing, “Boo!” fails on 
every level.

The nonsense begins quickly. No 

sooner have the poorly animated 
opening credits ended than direc-
tor/producer/writer/star/co-star 
Tyler Perry (“Diary of a Mad Black 
Woman”) treats us to a scene of 
the bro-iest frat bros to ever bro 
declaring they will have the best 
Halloween party in history with 
the passion that some Bond villains 
have declared they will destroy 
the world. This seems at first like 
it’s setup for something, but as the 
scene drags on it never crosses the 
line into funny, and it’s immediately 
clear what’s missing: a punchline.

It should be the easiest part of 

a comedy; even if one of the char-
acters spouts “Your mom!” or even 
farts, there’s a punchline. The joke, 
even if it’s bad, has an ending. Perry 

seems to think jokes work differ-
ently. Scene after endless scene 
shows him apparently under the 
impression that if his characters 
just sit and talk for long enough, 
then by the law of averages, some-
body is eventually bound to laugh. 
In the absence of anything funny, 

though, 
nobody 

laughs, and so the 
film labors on.

This could have 

worked if the char-
acters 
themselves 

were 
funny, 
but 

for characters that 
Perry 
has 
been 

working with for, 
in some cases, 25 
years, they’re argu-

ably the worst part of the movie. 
Brian (Perry) is a pushover who has 
no personality besides being a push-
over to his daughter, Tiffany (Dia-
mond White, “The Lion Guard”), 
who takes every “rebellious daugh-
ter” cliché in the book to such an 
insane degree that it’s exhausting 
to watch. Enter Madea (also Perry) 
and co., who advocates for physical 
abuse and illegal scare tactics, one 
of which they eventually end up 
using. Again, some of this could be 
funny, but again, there’s no punch-
line. Instead, viewers are left with 
several scenes of unlikable charac-
ters debating how best to deal with 
an unlikable man’s unlikable daugh-
ter.

Still, the marketing promised 

that “Boo!” would be a tribute to 
horror, and once again, this is an 
innately funny concept, taking 
Perry’s most insane creation and 
pitting her against other crazy 

characters. It has the potential to 
be great horror-comedy and a brief 
but welcome departure from the 
tone of the series. That potential is 
completely and utterly squandered 
by the 10-minute “horror” section 
of the movie which amounts to the 
several pranks explained away in a 
later scene which includes the line 
“We hacked the faucets.”

Since “Boo!” doesn’t work in 

any way a movie wshould, its only 
distinctly memorable parts are 
the moments where it encroaches 
on “So Bad It’s Good” territory. 
There are not one, but two scenes 
in which the characters huddle 
together and say “Now here’s what 
we’re gonna do…” before the cam-
era pans away and what sounds like 
a public domain soundtrack swells 
like a “Scooby-Doo” cartoon from 
the 1960s. Multiple shots are out 
of focus. In a baffling cameo, Tyga 
shows up and does a show for about 
20 people. It could be hilarious, but 
at a certain point, the lack of effort 
displayed in these moments just 
becomes frustrating instead.

Eventually, mercifully, as Madea 

celebrates having psychologically 
tortured a teenager into compla-
cency, the credits roll. The audience 
leaves, undeniably changed, for 
“Boo!” works on one level: it is the 
ultimate endurance test. Every 
moment that the inane dialogue 
doesn’t drive the viewer to insanity 
is a victory. Every “joke” that goes 
on for 10 minutes but doesn’t have a 
punchline is a red badge of courage. 
“Boo!” is genuinely flooring in just 
how atrocious it is, worth the price 
of admission only for those willing 
to test their mettle.

FILM REVIEW

6A — Monday, October 31, 2016
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

A 600-pound man sits on his 

couch. He has just found out he 
will likely die within the week. 
This is a story about severing ties 
with loved ones 
and a man’s desire 
to gain forgiveness 
— as long as death 
doesn’t catch him 
first.

This 
weekend, 

Basement 
Arts 

presents 
Samuel 

D. Hunter’s “The 
Whale,” a story of 
a morbidly obese 
man, Charlie, who 
has spent the past few years eating 
his way to death. After a warning 
that his time is running out, he 
works to mend his broken family 
relationships and redeem himself 
in his final days.

In 2012, the play first appeared 

off-Broadway 
by 
Playwrights 

Horizons at the Peter J. Sharp 
Theatre. It later earned the Lucille 
Lortel Award for Best Play in 2013. 

“It’s about someone who is 

dying, recognizes he is dying 
and is fighting to redeem himself 
before it happens,” said director 
Madeline Rouverol, a senior in the 
School of Music, Theatre & Dance. 
“It’s a character whose journey is 
all about self-redemption.”

The dynamic cast of “The 

Whale” offers many different 
types of personalities to the story. 
Charlie, played by SMTD senior 
Luke Jackson, wants to reconnect 
with his daughter Ellie, played 
by SMTD senior Kay Kelley, but 
recognizes she is full of rage and 
bitterness towards him. Charlie’s 
fears extend beyond his initial 
shock of dying and move into a 
new realm as he considers how he 
will be remembered if he doesn’t 
fix these relationships. Ultimately, 

he cannot accept dying in a 
dishonorable way.

“Through this willful self-

negligence, he is eating himself to 
death,” Rouverol said. “In a lot of 
ways, he is not attached to being 
alive anymore.”

Liz, played by SMTD senior 

Emma Boyden, is 
one 
of 
Charlie’s 

best friends and 
provides a lot of 
support for him, 
both as a nurse and 
as a friend. Tensions 
arise 
between 

Liz’s 
professed 

atheism and the 
Mormonism 
of 

another character, 
Elder 
Thomas. 

Played by SMTD sophomore Liam 
Allen, Elder Thomas hopes to 
guide Charlie toward a “spiritual” 
saving, whereas Liz just thinks he 
needs medical care. 

“You end up finding out that 

she (Liz) used to be a Mormon 
and she left the church,” Rouverol 
said. “You also find out that Elder 
Thomas is questioning his own 
faith, so saving Charlie is almost 
a means for him to solidify his 
beliefs.”

Of course, the heart of this story 

is found in Charlie himself, who 
in many ways isn’t your typical 
protagonist.

“Charlie 
is 
a 
fascinating 

character. I don’t think I’ve ever 
seen a play or film or piece of art 
that humanizes a morbidly obese 
person the way this play does,” 
Rouverol said.

Jackson said he has spent a lot 

of time thinking about how to play 
such a unique and challenging 
role, especially with such physical 
limits. Rouverol and Jackson have 
discussed the need to push past 
the initial interpretation of Charlie 
as the “gentle giant” and see him 
as a character who is fighting for 
purpose and forgiveness. 

“It’s not like the only thing 

this man ever did was become 
obese,” Jackson said. “There is an 
obligation and a responsibility to 
respect when that aspect of one’s 
life truly dominates both how they 
live their life and how their life is 
viewed through society.”

Many of the scenes in the 

play are written in a simple, 
conversational 
way, 
though 

Rouverol said she wants to make 
sure the simplicity of the script 
does not take away from the 
meaning behind each moment.

“If we didn’t remind ourselves 

of the kind of ticking clock of his 
life, these scenes could be seen as 
casual,” Rouverol said. “I’ve been 
trying to get them to keep in mind 
the urgency and the stakes. He 
could die in five minutes, he could 
die in a day or he could die in an 
hour.”

Cast members said they were 

surprised by how many personal 
connections they could make 
with the play and their characters, 
even though at first they thought 
Charlie’s condition was something 
they 
could 
easily 
distance 

themselves from. 

“There are so many points of 

connection that people can have 
with this play and it’s important 
for people to look at plays that look 
directly at mortality,” Rouverol 
said. “I think it’s something 
college-aged students want to 
pretend doesn’t exist, but it’s 
important to look at it and consider 
what really matters in the end.”

“The Whale” illuminates the 

theme of finding beauty from 
simplicity — quotidian details 
hold much more value when 
considering how short life is — and 
Rouverol has directed her cast 
towards discovering this truth.

“That’s what I love about the 

play,” Rouverol said. “Everyday 
moments are put into a bizarre 
perspective when you’re looking 
death in the face.”

A heartbreaker moves into the past

E

AST LANSING — It was 
heartbreaking, Kenny 
Allen said, though even 

that doesn’t seem to do it justice.

A year and a couple of weeks 

ago, Allen 
stood in the 
Crisler Center 
media room 
after one 
of the most 
stunning 
losses in 
the history 
of college 
football. The 
kicker had 
the unenviable task of speaking 
to reporters after that crushing 
defeat — though there wasn’t 
much to say.

He spoke in a soft voice, his 

face still wearing the same 
expressionless shock as everyone 
else in the stadium that day. He 
said he was as close as he could 
have been to punter Blake O’Neill 
bobbling a snap with 10 seconds 
left before Michigan State 
returned it for a game-winning 
touchdown as time expired. At 
some point, after the Spartans 
changed the college football 
world and before he stepped foot 
into the media room, Allen told 
O’Neill that the team would stand 
behind him.

“We support Blake through 

everything,” Allen said that day. 
“That’s the kind of team we’re 
going to be.”

And that’s the kind of team 

the Wolverines have been since 
their in-state rival devastated 
them last Oct. 17. They have lost 
only once since. They capped a 
successful 2015 season with a 
rout of Florida in the Citrus Bowl. 
They have steamrolled eight 
opponents this season, most of 
them with ease.

And they have patiently waited 

for the day they could finally 
put their feelings about last year 
further into the rearview mirror.

Saturday in East Lansing, that 

chance came, though it came 
with plenty of memories. Three 
hours before the noon kickoff, a 
tailgate near the stadium played 
the audio from ESPN broadcaster 
Sean McDonough’s call of the 

play. Just outside the stadium, 
one man began reciting the 
same call to his friend. Inside, 
Michigan State’s students had 
bigger plans in mind.

At 10:50, as Allen began 

practicing field goals on the 
south goalposts in front of the 
student section, the 1,000 or so 
in the crowd began chanting 
the call: “Whoa, he has trouble 
with the snap! And the ball is 
free! It’s picked up by Michigan 
State’s Jalen Watts-Jackson, and 
he scores! On the last play of the 
game! Unbelievable!”

There was no escaping it, 

though Allen said he didn’t hear 
much of it. “You just have to have 
a sense of humor,” he said. Once 
the Wolverines started winning, 
the talk died down.

“Someone made fun of my 

mustache, which I’ve been 
working pretty hard to grow, so 
that one cut deep,” Allen quipped.

A year ago, humor was an 

impossible perspective. It could 
have been difficult even a few 
weeks ago. After Allen started 
his season 3-for-3 on field goals, 
he missed two kicks against 
Colorado on Sept. 17 and two 
more against Wisconsin on Oct. 
1. After the latter game, Michigan 
coach Jim Harbaugh declared 
that there would be an open 
competition for the kicking job 
starting the following week. 
Allen never relinquished it.

Last week against Illinois, he 

hit two chip shots for his first 
conversions in five weeks. At 
Michigan State, he finished 3-for-3, 
making two more short kicks but 
also a season-long 45 yarder that 
helped put the game out of reach.

The Wolverines won, 32-23, 

beating the Spartans for the 
first time since 2012 and taking 
perhaps the biggest step toward 
putting last year’s mishap behind 
them. Allen was back among the 
top contributors from a simple 
math standpoint: Michigan won 
by nine, and he kicked three field 
goals worth three points each. If 
he hadn’t, the game could have 
turned out much differently. 
Perhaps he would have even been 
the goat, as O’Neill was last year.

“I’m so happy for him — he’s 

an amazing person, amazing 
player,” said senior cornerback 
Jourdan Lewis. “He did his job 
today. He did an amazing job 
today, kept us in the game, made 
sure we had the lead the whole 
game. I’m just proud of him. He 
did his job. He wasn’t worried 
about the past.”

Allen’s kicks Saturday silenced 

his critics and helped add more 
distance between now and 
last year. In the years to come, 
O’Neill’s miscue will fade deeper 
into the past. In Michigan’s next 
visit to East Lansing in 2018, the 
broadcast echoes will be less 
frequent, and the tongue-in-cheek 
T-shirt with O’Neill’s name and 
number should be gone from the 
front row of the student section.

The two rivals will play 

many more exciting games 
with exciting finishes, and the 
punt from last year will be but 
a memory alongside Colorado’s 
Hail Mary in 1994, John 
Wangler’s pass to Anthony Carter 
in 1979 and so many others.

The presence of last year’s 

game is not as faint as those yet, 
but the Wolverines have moved 
forward. Just before Allen got 
off the bus Saturday morning, 
O’Neill texted him and long 
snapper Scott Sypniewski. “I’m 
excited to see you guys go out 
there and do your thing,” Allen 
recalled the message saying.

The memory of last year still 

stings for now, but Saturday, 
Michigan went out and did its 
thing. With nine minutes to go 
in the game and the Wolverines 
up by 20, Allen dropped back to 
punt. Before he got it off without 
a hitch, the chant “Block the 
punt!” echoed from the Michigan 
State student section, calling up 
those demons from last year.

Perhaps the students had that 

chant planned for all afternoon. 
We’ll never know. That was 
Michigan’s first punt. For 
Saturday, that was a statement 
in itself.

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Kenny Allen’s success on special teams helped Michigan move past last year.

ICE HOCKEY
Wolverines falter at 
Dartmouth, Vermont

In 
a 
matter 
of 
seconds, 

Dartmouth forward Troy Crema 
determined the outcome of a 
game that has now been recorded 
as the No. 11 Michigan hockey 
team’s third loss this year.

With only 49 seconds left 

in the third period and the 
game knotted up, 2-2, Crema 
slipped the puck past freshman 
goaltender Jack LaFontaine off 
an assist from Corey Kalk and 
Carl Hesler. The deficit proved 
to be insurmountable for the 
Wolverines, who finalized the 
weekend by tacking on two losses 
for a 3-3-1 overall season record.

Their 
first 

loss came at the 
hands of Vermont 
on Friday in a 
shutout, 
3-0. 

The Catamounts 
started the game 
early with a goal 
22 seconds into 
the first period, 
and another at 
the 10:36 mark. 
And even though 
freshman 
goaltender 
Hayden 

Lavigne recorded 39 saves, he 
couldn’t stop the final power-play 
goal of the night by Vermont’s 
Rob Hamilton that pushed the 
Catamounts to a 3-0 lead.

Michigan 
recorded 
eight 

penalties for the night and was 
doubled up in shots, managing 
just 21 against Vermont’s 42. 
While the Wolverines managed 
to close the gap to 35-24 in their 
match Saturday against the Big 
Green, it still wasn’t enough to 
put them ahead.

“You could tell they were 

excited 
— 
this 
was 
their 

hometown and they were really 
physical right off the bat,” said 
senior forward Alex Kile. “You 
could tell that they wanted to 

win. It was evident really quickly. 
I think the main thing was they 
tried to use their physicality and 
create turnovers.”

Initially kicking the game 

off on the right foot, freshman 
forward Adam Winborg scored 
the first goal of the game — and in 
his career — 17 minutes into the 
first period. The power-play goal 
came off of assists from Kile and 
junior defenseman Sam Piazza to 
put Michigan ahead, 1-0.

However, Dartmouth took over 

the second period with goals from 
Kevin Neiley and Cam Strong. The 
Wolverines also recorded three of 
their five penalties in this period, 
two of which occurred at the same 
time. Kile and senior forward 

Max Shuart both 
landed 
in 
the 

penalty box at 
the 12:43 mark 
for 
charging 

and 
boarding, 

respectively. 
This resulted in 
two minutes of 
play with the Big 
Green possessing 
a 
two-man 

advantage, 5-3.

However, Michigan managed 

to kill off both penalties without 
a goal, and at the 10:33 mark in 
the third period, Kile tied up the 
game after corralling a loose puck 
and shooting it past Dartmouth 
goaltender Devin Buffalo.

But Kile’s goal did only that — 

tie the game. And with no answer 
for Crema’s goal in the final 
minute, the Wolverines faced 
their second loss of the weekend. 

“We need to learn how to close 

out the game,” Kile said. “We’ve 
kinda (blown) games in the third 
period all season long, and that’s 
got to stop. I thought we actually 
played pretty well tonight, we 
were pretty physical and we 
played the game, but we just didn’t 
close it out how we wanted to.”

last-second, go-ahead goal Saturday

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN

It’s safe to start dreaming

Y

ou’ve thought it quietly 
to yourself. Now it’s OK 
to start thinking it out 

loud.

Michigan might have played 

its worst 
quarter of 
the season 
to close out 
its 32-23 
win over 
Michigan 
State on 
Saturday, but 
the end result 
clinched 
it. At 8-0, 
ranked No. 2 
in the country and (finally) with 
a win against one of its chief 
rivals, it’s time to start thinking 
about this as a special season in 
Ann Arbor.

Of course, it’s no lock. The 

Wolverines still have to win 
two more home games and then 
beat Iowa in a road night game. 
They still have to face an Ohio 
State team that has the talent 
and coaching to upend those 
dreams in the season’s final 
week. They’ll likely have to beat 
either No. 8 Wisconsin again or 
No. 9 Nebraska in the Big Ten 
Championship game.

But after this weekend, that’s 

the bar. This has special-season 
potential, and the next month is 
all about whether Michigan can 
realize it.

Thanks to the College 

Football Playoff, seasons 
are no longer bound to 
a championship-or-bust 
dichotomy, except in 
Tuscaloosa, Ala. If the 
Wolverines go 13-0, winning 
their first Big Ten Championship 
since 2004, it’s special. If they 
make the playoff, even if it 
means losing to Alabama, it will 
be remembered forever.

Even though this season 

doesn’t have to end with confetti 
like 1997, it’s hard to argue there 

would be no disappointment 
if it turned out like 2006. If 
Michigan walks into Columbus 
undefeated and loses, the 
deflation would be palpable. A 
Rose Bowl win would probably 
be significant enough to declare 
it a banner year, but with the 
way the Wolverines are going, 
a loss in Pasadena might make 
the year feel like something of a 
missed opportunity.

That’s how far Jim Harbaugh 

has taken Michigan in the last 
22 months.

Interestingly enough, the 

Wolverines have stats on their 

side — the normal ones and the 
weird ones.

The 

analytics-
driven S&P 
rankings have 
Michigan at 
No. 1 in the 
nation behind 
a suffocating 
defense that 
also ranks 
first in scoring 
and yards 
allowed. The 
Wolverines are scoring the 
third-most points per game in 

the country, and ESPN ranks 
their special teams unit as the 

nation’s 16th 
most efficient, 
second-best 
among teams 
currently 
ranked in the 
Associated 
Press top 10.

And then 

there are the 
oddities that 
past national 
champions 

have tended to share. Seven of 
the last nine quarterbacks to 

win a national championship 
have been first-year starters 
on their team, which redshirt 
sophomore Wilton Speight 
is. Of all the coaches to win 
national titles since 2000, only 
one (Mack Brown) did not win 
one in his first four seasons, and 
Harbaugh is in his second year 
with Michigan.

There all kinds of ways to 

explain those two stats (young 
quarterbacks have the benefit 
of chasing the top, not staying 
there; dominant coaches tend 
to win early and often), and it’s 
possible they don’t mean all 

that much. But when a team like 
Michigan possesses both and is 
in conversation for the playoff, 
they come up. That’s one of the 
identifiers of a special season.

So are Heisman Trophy 

candidates, and Jabrill Peppers 
is most certainly that. He 
probably was before he scored 
two rushing touchdowns against 
Rutgers, and he certainly is 
now, after another rushing 
touchdown, two more tackles 
for loss, a sack and a defensive 
2-point conversion return 
against the Spartans.

He’s the kind of player fans 

pine for long after they’ve 
left, and he’s not the only one 
Michigan has on its roster. 
Cornerback Jourdan Lewis and 
tight end Jake Butt spurned 
the NFL to play their senior 
seasons. Receivers Amara 
Darboh and Jehu Chesson 
and defensive linemen Ryan 
Glasgow and Chris Wormley 
came back for their fifth years. 
Most of the offensive line 
has been together for three 
seasons. It’s the kind of roster 
fans fantasize about in their 
championship dreams.

Which brings us back to 

Saturday, a day fans have looked 
forward to for a year. They 
anticipated a remedy to the 
painful memories of seasons 
past, and they got one.

After Speight took the final 

kneel down, Peppers did a back 
flip. Speight gave a triumphant 
fist pump as he moved toward 
the tunnel. Both tried to get the 
crowd even louder.

It was a special moment. And 

for the first time in a long time, 
it feels like more are coming.

‘M’ falls to top-ranked Terps in 2OT

In the 15-year history of the 

Michigan men’s soccer program, 
the Wolverines had never beaten 
the nation’s 
top-ranked 
team. And 
despite 
holding a two-goal lead 65 
minutes into the game, Sunday, 
Michigan (1-6-1 Big Ten, 3-10-4 
overall) allowed that streak to 
continue against No. 1 Maryland 
(7-0-1, 15-0-2), falling, 3-2, in 
crushing fashion.

With 
88 
minutes 
gone, 

it appeared the Wolverines 
would finally capture their 
signature win, as Maryland 
desperately 
attacked 
to 

protect its undefeated record 
with Michigan clinging to a 
one-goal lead. But with just 
over a minute remaining in 
regulation, Terrapin defender 
Chris Odoi-Atsem equalized 
off a service from midfielder 
George Campbell — crushing 
the spirits of the Wolverines 
as many laid down on the 
grass 
in 
disappointment 

and 
exhaustion, 
while 
a 

strong 
Maryland 
contingent 

celebrated from the stands.

Roughly 20 minutes later, 

Michigan’s dream turned into a 
nightmarish loss. In the second 
overtime period, defender Suli 
Dainkeh buried a shot from 
the left side past Wolverines 
goaltender Evan Louro for the 
game-winner. 
But 
Michigan 

coach 
Chaka 
Daley 
argued 

Dainken 
never 
should 
have 

gotten the opportunity to give 
the Terrapins the win, as a hard 
challenge led to a Wolverine 
turnover in the box.

“It was a foul,” Daley said. 

“He pushes a guy down — it’s 
a foul. It was called all day as a 
foul, and it was not called in the 
last minute of the game.”

Daley found the officiating to 

be one of the culprits behind the 
crushing loss for the Wolverines.

“The referee impacted the 

game 
immensely,” 
he 
said. 

“For us, I think he changed the 
game. You’re supposed to keep 
it neutral, and I think that … 
inconsistency changes games.”

Despite the alleged injustice 

against Daley’s team, Michigan 
was 
able 
to 

capture 
a 
2-0 

lead in the first 
half 
thanks 

to 
goals 
by 

sophomore 
midfielder 
Robbie 
Mertz 

and 
freshman 

forward 
Jack 

Hallahan 
— 

both of which 
were 
assisted 

by sophomore forward Francis 
Atuahene, who now has seven 
points in Michigan’s last two 
contests.

The tide turned for Maryland 

when, off a handball, the nation’s 
third-leading 
scorer 
Gordon 

Wild placed a penalty shot into 
the lower left corner of the goal 
during the 66th minute.

“Goals change games,” Daley 

said, who continued to question 
the competency of the referees. 
“The penalty kick — is it or isn’t 
it, you know?”

After 
Wild’s 
conversion, 

Maryland was able to control 

possession 
and 
pepper 

the 
goal 
with 

strong attempts, 
resulting in an 
astounding 
27 

shots from the 
Terrapins 
and 

11 
saves 
from 

Louro 
— 
his 

season high.

As Maryland 

found 
itself 

facing its largest deficit of the 
season, tempers boiled over in 
the first half. A foul on Maryland 
midfielder 
Connor 
Smith 

resulted 
in 
extracurricular 

pushing 
between 
him 
and 

Hallahan. 
That 
exchange 

sparked 
a 
confrontational 

atmosphere for the rest of 
the contest, as Atuahene and 
midfielder 
Tyler 
Anderson 

both received yellow cards for 
the Wolverines in a match that 
saw many players flailing to 
the ground and clutching their 
shinguards in pain.

“I 
like 
that 
competitive 

atmosphere,” Anderson said. “It 
makes the game more fun, and 
it makes (the game) go by a lot 
quicker.”

In a season in which little has 

gone right for the Wolverines, 
Michigan seemed on the brink 
of a season-defining win Sunday. 
But even that was stripped 
from the team, adding salt to an 
already opened wound.

“I don’t know if anyone in 

the country has played more 
heartbreaking games than we 
have,” Daley said. “Certainly, 
we’re going to pick ourselves 
up and go and fight (in the Big 
Ten Tournament on Saturday) 
against a Rutgers team that’s 
fighting for their lives as well.”

WOMEN’S SOCCER

VOLLEYBALL

Wolverines win in PKs 
in Big Ten quarterfinal

In practice on Friday, the 

Michigan women’s soccer team 
didn’t make a single one of its 
penalty 
kicks.

Luckily 

for the Wolverines, Sunday was a 
new day.

Michigan (6-3-2 Big Ten, 11-4-

3 overall) made all four penalty 
kicks against Wisconsin (8-5-7) 
to pave its way to the Big Ten 
Tournament semifinals Friday 
against top-seeded Minnesota.

“We’ve 
been 
practicing 

(penalty kicks) all season because 
we knew it could go into this,” 
said Michigan coach Greg Ryan. 
“Especially the last few days 
we’ve been doing a penalty kick 
contest.”

The last time the two teams 

met, on Oct. 13, the game ended 
in a 1-1 draw, with the Badgers 
scoring first and the Wolverines 
scoring later on in the game to 
force the tie. On Sunday, Michigan 
drew first blood. In the 20th 
minute, sophomore forward Reilly 
Martin turned on her defender, 
accelerated down the right flank 
and sent in a cross. Senior forward 
Nicky Waldeck met the cross in 
the air, heading home her eighth 
goal of the season. 

But it didn’t take long for 

the Badgers to equalize, finally 
turning 
their 
overwhelming 

possession in the final third into a 
goal. Wisconsin defender Payton 
Wesley gathered the ball on the 
right end line and crossed it into 
the middle toward her teammate, 
forward Emily Borgmann, who 
finished the chance cooly. 

From 
there, 
both 
sides 

sputtered 
on 
offense, 
with 

chances few and far between. 
Neither side controlled the flow of 
the ball in the midfield, and both 
relied heavily on long through 
passes to forwards making runs. 

“I thought we were off our 

game for a good portion of (the 
game),” Ryan said. “But it was just 
a game where we just had to fight. 
It’s just a gritty performance.”

Ryan 
attributes 
much 
of 

that struggle to the challenge 
the Badgers presented, while 
simultaneously 
crediting 
his 

defense — and its 3-4-3 formation 
— for negating Wisconsin’s attack.

“They’re a very good defending 

team,” Ryan said. “They play that 
tight diamond in midfield, and it’s 
very hard to play in behind them. 
… (The formation) allowed us to 
at least get pressure on almost all 
of their players on the field, and 
I think that was causing them 
problems.”

Neither overtime period was 

enough to decide the victor. 
Unlike the draw two weeks 
ago, Michigan and Wisconsin 
headed to penalty kicks to 
decide 
which 
team 
would 

advance 
to 
the 
conference 

tournament semifinal. 

And 
redshirt 
sophomore 

goalkeeper 
Sarah 
Jackson 

ensured that spot would belong 
to the Wolverines, despite an 
unconventional strategy to do so.

“I have a really bad strategy 

(for penalty kicks),” Jackson said. 
“I told my coach I always dive to 
the right.”

After seeing the first Badgers’ 

shot find the crossbar, Jackson 
knew one stop would all but 
secure the win.

In Wisconsin’s second attempt, 

Jackson decided to dive to her 
left, and reaped the benefits — 
knocking away the line-drive 
attempt that seemed destined for 
the corner of the net.

The Wolverines converted 

each 
attempt, 
winning 
the 

penalty 
shootout, 
4-2, 
and 

sealing 
the 
matchup 
with 

Minnesota on Friday.

And if that matchup reaches 

penalty kicks, Jackson may just 
decide to dive left more often.

Michigan falls on road 
against Indiana, Purdue

For the first time this season, 

the Michigan women’s volleyball 
team 
lost 
two 
consecutive 

matches.

The 
Wolverines 
took 
on 

Purdue on Friday and lost in 
four sets, and the following day, 
Michigan fell in the same way 
against Indiana.

Even though the matches 

followed 
similar 
patterns, 

Indiana and Purdue could not 
be more unlike, according to 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen. 
Indiana dominated at the net 
while Rosen praised Purdue for 
using their physicality to throw 
off Michigan’s game plan. 

“We knew that the styles of 

play were going to be totally 
different,” Rosen said. “The way 
Indiana plays and the way Purdue 
plays are 180 degrees different.”

The 
Wolverines 
lost 
the 

first set of both matches, but 
came back strong and won the 
second. The team fell short in 
the fourth set against Purdue the 
following two sets and finished 
the weekend with no victories, 
though not without a fight. 
With a deficit of 12 points, the 
Wolverines had a 5-2 point run 
to make a small comeback, but 
ultimately lost on a service error.

Rosen outlined two game 

plans for the vastly different 
opponents, but at game time, his 
team did not execute.

“I don’t think we did a good 

job of being disciplined to our 
game plan,” Rosen said. “That’s 
certainly something we have to 
be good at if we’re going to be 
successful. Every team we play, 
we go into it with a certain plan.”

The team also lacked its usual 

offensive power. Against Purdue, 
the Wolverines tallied a .117 
attack average, the second-lowest 
of their season. Saturday, the 
attack average was an even lower 

0.93. Sophomore libero Jenna 
Lerg led the defense for the 24th 
game in a row, but Rosen was still 
unhappy with the performance.

“I don’t think we attacked 

very well — we hit under 100 as 
a team,” Rosen said. “I think our 
passing was not great, I think we 
could’ve executed much better 
with the ball control we had.”

Even with such a low hitting 

percentage, the Wolverines put 
up a fight in the fourth set of the 
match on Saturday and kept the 
game close.

After trailing by seven points, 

the team was able to go on a 
10-3 point run led by sophomore 
outside 
hitter 
Carly 
Skjodt 

and senior outside hitter Kelly 
Murphy to tie the score at 12-12. 
Indiana led for the majority of 
the remainder of the match by 
one point with ties at 15-15 and 
16-16. A kill by Skjodt, tied the 
game at 23-23 after another kill 
by Skjodt forced Indiana to call 
a timeout at 21-23. But Michigan 
faltered late, losing the last two 
points to drop the set and match.

“I’m encouraged by the fact 

that we fought hard and that we 
never gave up,” Rosen said. “We 
let things get away from us there 
at the end, both last night and 
tonight, but we have to get much 
better with our execution.”

Though 
the 
Wolverines 

have victories over Rutgers, 
Northwestern, Maryland and 
Kansas State on the road, they 
have losses against Pittsburgh, 
Penn State and now Indiana 
and Purdue.

“We play better at home 

than we do on the road,” Rosen 
said. “But we can’t use that as 
an excuse, we’ve got to find a 
way to play better in different 
environments.”

With a 10-2 home record and 

a second shot, Michigan will 
have another chance to create its 
game plans against Indiana this 
Saturday at Cliff Keen Arena.

Wolverines lose to both teams, 3-1; 
fall to 7-5 in Big Ten, 4-4 on the road

Finn, Wolverines earn Big Ten titles

Erin Finn has had no shortage 

of accomplishments during her 
time at Michigan. She’s a six-
time Big Ten champion and 
two-time NCAA runner-up in 
track and field, and her victory 
on Sunday at the Big Ten Cross 
Country 
Championships 
in 

Minneapolis, Minn., marked the 
third individual conference title 
of her career.

This time, though, she finally 

got to share her title with the 
rest of her team.

The senior led the No. 6 

Michigan women’s cross country 
team to its first conference title 
since 2012, crossing the finish 
line at the challenging 6,000-
meter Les Bolstad Golf Course 
in 20:37.30, 25 seconds ahead of 
her closest competitor. With 63 
points, the Wolverines edged 
out No. 9 Penn State, which 
totaled 70 points.

The Wolverines had already 

raced this course this season, 
finishing 
fifth 
in 
tough 

conditions at the Roy Griak 
Invitational 
in 
September. 

While the terrain wasn’t as 
muddy as it was during that 
race, the soft ground and 
challenging hills still presented 
an intimidating obstacle.

“It wasn’t super muddy, but it 

was slick,” said Michigan coach 
Mike McGuire. “People fell in 
the race losing their legs on 
sidehills or if they were coming 
into a turn. By no means was it 
pristine, but everybody had to 
deal with it.”

Even with Finn’s typically 

dominant 
performance, 
the 

Wolverines knew that winning 
a team title would require 
strong performances from every 
runner. They were bolstered 
by redshirt junior Gina Sereno, 
who placed fourth with a time of 
21:07.30 and joined Finn on the 
all-conference first team after 
what McGuire described as her 
best race of the season. 

Also 
contributing 
to 
the 

Wolverines’ team score was 
junior Avery Evenson, a second-
team 
all-conference 
honoree 

with her 14th place finish, 
and redshirt juniors Jaimie 
Phelan and Jamie Morrissey, 
who finished 19th and 25th, 
respectively.

Michigan had finished second 

at the conference championships 
in 2013 and 2015, and third in 
2014. For Finn, after coming 
so close to a team title the last 
three seasons, the feeling upon 
claiming victory this year was 
one of jubilation.

“I’m 
so 

extraordinarily 
proud 
of 
this 

group of girls,” 
Finn 
said. 

“We’ve worked 
so 
hard, 
and 

I’m 
really 

impressed with 
the 
progress 

we’ve made and 
the fact that we 
finally went out and did what we 
said we were going to do.”

The Big Ten Championships 

capped off a month full of 
highlights for Michigan. At 

the Roy Griak Invitational, the 
Wolverines 
finished 
behind 

Portland, Michigan State, Penn 
State and Boise State. They have 
now defeated three of those 
teams in their last two races, 
placing ahead of the Pilots 
at the adidas Pre-Nationals 
and topping the Spartans and 
Nittany Lions on Sunday.

“We knew it was going to be 

a three team battle going in,” 

McGuire 
said. 

“(Michigan State 
and Penn State) 
definitely 
have 

been established 
programs in the 
conference 
for 

the last several 
years, 
and 
we 

knew 
it 
was 

going to require 
our best race up 
to this point in 

the season.”

McGuire stated that he has 

been most impressed with the 
discipline and accountability 
of his runners, as well as their 

ability to stay focused and 
competitive at all times.

“The level of engagement that 

you see in their eyes and body 
language, we saw it with all nine 
(runners),” McGuire said. “We 
don’t have one taking the day off 
and putting it on the other eight.

“They’ve 
been 
that 
way 

throughout 
the 
season 
in 

practice, and it really reached its 
zenith today.”

Soon, the Wolverines will 

have to start preparing for 
 

the 
Great 
Lakes 
Regional 

in Madison, Wisc., on Nov. 
11, and the NCAA National 
Championships in Terre Haute, 
Ind., on Nov. 19. But for now, 
they can revel in a hard-earned 
victory long in the making.

“It’s been so hard to be so 

close the past two times I’ve 
competed,” Finn said. “I know 
everyone has given it their all 
and just to come up a little bit 
short has been really tough.

“I’m just so thankful that we 

were able to put it together this 
year.”

Five Things We Learned: Michigan State

The day Michigan fans awaited 

for a year finally arrived, and the 
Michigan football team came 
home with the trophy it expected. 
For the first time since 2012, and 
the first time in East Lansing 
since 2007, the Wolverines beat 
Michigan State on Saturday, 32-23.

The 
spread 
closed 
with 

Michigan favored by 24.5, and 
many expected the game to be 
even more lopsided. A good-sized 
contingent of maize and blue-clad 
fans dotted Spartan Stadium and 
generated a few “Let’s Go Blue” 
chants throughout the afternoon.

The Wolverines weren’t satisfied 

with their performance, but their 
offense was efficient, their defense 
mostly strong and their special 
teams solid. They struggled in 
the first quarter, dominated in 
the middle quarters and held on 
at the end. The latter is the most 
important result — Michigan is 8-0 
and still No. 2 in the country.

Here are five things we learned 

from its latest win:

1. LJ Scott is the best back 

Michigan has faced this season.

Michigan State gave its fans a 

good reason to celebrate after the 
first series, and Michigan fans 
must have been a bit antsy. To open 
Saturday’s game, Scott did what no 
player or team had done against the 
Wolverines all season: He ran the 
ball into the teeth of their defense.

The opening drive went 75 

yards in 12 plays over 7:02. Scott 
carried the ball for 10 of those 
plays, gaining 49 yards and a 
touchdown. He added a 12-yard 
reception on the only third down 
Michigan State faced. Michigan 
had given up long touchdowns 
before, but the Wolverines had 
not been dominated up front for 
an entire series. Scott was quick to 
get into space and elude the front 
seven, and he broke a couple of 
tackles to reach the second level.

The sophomore became the 

first player to rush for 100 yards 
against Michigan this season — 
in fact, only one team (Central 
Florida) had reached that mark 
before Saturday. And perhaps if 
the Spartans had given Scott the 
ball more, the game would have 
been much different. On their next 
series, they again marched into 
Michigan territory on a 10-play 
drive but didn’t run any plays for 
Scott. Starting at the Michigan 
47-yard line, backup running back 
Gerald Holmes carried four times 
for nine yards, turning the ball 
over on downs. The Wolverines 
never trailed again.

2. Kenny Allen is Kenny Allen 

again.

Michigan’s 
fifth-year 
senior 

kicker has had a rough year, going 

1-for-5 on field goals in a three-
game span from Sept. 17 to Oct. 1. 
After that stretch, head coach Jim 
Harbaugh reopened the kicking 
competition between him, walk-
on Ryan Tice and true freshman 
Quinn Nordin, and then he didn’t 
send the field-goal team out against 
Rutgers. Allen, though, maintained 
his job, and said Saturday his 
confidence never wavered.

“We’ve 
been 
practicing 

different situations in practice, 
and I’ve kicked more balls than I 
care to count,” Allen said. “I just 
knew if I went out there, just did 
what I knew how to do, then it 
would work out fine.”

Two conversions from 23 and 

27 yards against Illinois began to 
move the needle a bit, and then 
Allen hit two more chip shots 
against Michigan State. Then 
came 
the 
most 
encouraging 

sign, a season-high 45-yarder 
early in the fourth quarter that 
put Michigan up 30-10. It’s not a 
season-changer, but Allen now 
looks more like himself — he’s 
9-for-13 on the year heading into 
a final stretch in which Michigan 
will need him.

3. Michigan still has plenty 
in the playbook for Eddie 

McDoom.

After a solid early stretch against 

two 
overmatched 
opponents, 

Michigan went away from its 
freshman speedster for a while. 
Opponents started to game plan for 
McDoom’s signature jet sweep, too 
— Colorado and Penn State each 
sniffed out plays and caused five-
yard losses, and McDoom didn’t 
touch the ball against Wisconsin.

Last week against Illinois, 

though, Harbaugh made sure 
McDoom was still a threat in the 
offense. He started McDoom on 
the left, motioned him right as if to 
take a handoff, then sent him back 
left for a screen pass that netted 33 
yards. Saturday, Michigan threw 
another curveball when redshirt 
sophomore Jabrill Peppers took 
the snap as a wildcat quarterback 
and found McDoom on a reverse 
for a 33-yard pickup.

Whenever the Wolverines can 

get McDoom in space, it usually 
works out well for them. The 
freshman was the team’s leading 
rusher Saturday with 53 yards, 
and he’s up to 138 on the season — 
as a wide receiver.

4. Ben Braden is Michigan’s left 

tackle.

Even after Braden started last 

week against Illinois, Harbaugh 
wouldn’t commit to keeping 
him at left tackle going forward. 
Michigan 
started 
redshirt 

sophomore 
Juwann 
Bushell-

Beatty in that position against 
Rutgers after Grant Newsome 
suffered a season-ending injury 
Oct. 1, but after the bye week, 
Harbaugh switched things up 
and moved Braden from left 
guard to left tackle and inserted 
freshman Ben Bredeson at left 
guard.

After 
Saturday’s 
win, 
it 

appears that’s how the lineup 
will stay. The Wolverines did not 
allow a sack against Michigan 
State, and they did a nice job 
of handling Spartan defensive 
lineman Malik McDowell. Up 
next is a Maryland team, led 
by former Michigan defensive 
coordinator D.J. Durkin, that’s 
averaging 2.5 sacks this season.

5. BOLD PREDICTION: Jabrill 

Peppers ends up leading this 

team in sacks, too.

Michigan’s 
do-everything 

man 
already 
has 
near-

insurmountable leads in punt-
return and kick-return yards. 
He has 249 and 153, respectively, 
while the next player in each 
category has 27 and 28. He has 
also pulled into first by a wide 
margin in tackles for loss with 
12.5, and he ranks second on the 
team in all-purpose yards per 
game while playing primarily 
defense.

But his sack of Michigan State 

quarterback Brian Lewerke on 
 

Saturday gave him 3.5 for the 
season, trailing only defensive 
ends Chris Wormley and Taco 
Charlton, who have four each. 
Peppers keeps finding ways to 
do more, and should he get the 
opportunity in the last four 
games, he could end up pacing 
the team in sacks as well — a 
remarkable achievement for a 
player who plays all three phases 
of the game.

THE MICHIGAN 

DAILY TOP-10 POLL 

2. MICHIGAN: It’s great that 
Paul Bunyan is back in Ann 
Arbor, but we’re not even sure 
he’s good enough to start for 
Michigan’s D-line.

1. ALABAMA: Say what you 
want about their brutal SEC 
schedule, but the Crimson 
Tide didn’t play ANYONE 
this week.

9. NEBRASKA: No one 
noticed they lost because 
everyone else did, too.

3. CLEMSON: Dabo 
Swinney may be a man of 
God, but it sure seems like 
his team made a deal with 
the devil.

6. OHIO STATE: No offense to 
the Buckeyes, they just really 
don’t seem to have one.

5. LOUISVILLE: Having a 
Heisman moment against 
Virginia is basically the 
college football equivalent 
of a tree falling in the forest 
when nobody’s around.

7. TEXAS A&M: Get this, 
the Aggies faced off against 
the Aggies. That’s wild, 
man.

4. WASHINGTON: This team 
is just getting higher and 
higher.

8. WISCONSIN: Have 
two teams in the Big Ten 
East ever wanted to play 
Wisconsin again so badly?

10. AUBURN: There were 
really only nine good teams 
this week.

Each week, Daily sports staffers fill out ballots, 

with first-place votes receiving 10 points, second-

Darboh validates No. 1 receiver status

EAST 
LANSING 
— 
After 

Michigan State turned the ball 
over on downs on the Michigan 
football team’s 4-yard line in the 
third quarter, the Wolverines 
(5-0 Big Ten, 8-0 overall) knew 
they had their work cut out for 
them if they wanted to get back 
in enemy territory.

The first play fizzled out 

quickly after sophomore running 
back 
Karan 
Higdon 
picked 

up two yards, but redshirt 
sophomore quarterback Wilton 
Speight saw a golden opportunity 
on the following play.

Michigan State cornerback 

Justin Layne was glued to wide 
receiver Amara Darboh, but 
Speight threw the ball to the 
fifth-year senior anyway, hurling 
it 39 yards down the left sideline. 

While falling, Darboh reeled it 
in with his left hand for the final 
catch of his career day.

“There was that deep ball 

down the left-hand side where 
Amara 
couldn’t 

really 
get 
his 

right 
hand 
up 

because he was 
being held, so he 
was able to pull 
it in with one 
arm,” 
Speight 

said. 
“To 
get 

from the 5-yard 
line 
to 
close 

to the 50-yard 
line — that’s a 
momentum-
shifter. It makes my job easier 
when I have a bigger target.”

The drive ultimately ended in 

a field goal, and though the final 
score of 32-23 may not reflect it, 
the game was close well into the 

fourth quarter. Darboh hadn’t 
experienced a Michigan win over 
the Spartans since he redshirted 
in 
2012, 
but 
in 
Saturday’s 

victory, he made the difference 

the 
Wolverines 

needed. 
Darboh 
was 

the recipient of 
half of Speight’s 
completions, 
catching 
eight 

passes 
for 
165 

yards.

“His 
game 

is 
very 
high-

level,” 
said 

Michigan 
coach 

Jim 
Harbaugh. 

“Some of the highest I’ve seen of a 
college receiver. I think he’s well-
established as a great playmaker 
and also disciplined in every single 
route he runs. He blocks, great 
teammate — just, he does it all, and 

does it the best he can possibly do. 
He’s got a lot of God-given talent 
and a great work ethic.

“It was a premier game for 

him today.”

After celebrating having the 

Paul Bunyan Trophy back in the 
Wolverines’ locker room, Darboh 
returned to business as usual and 
met with the media.

Nothing was more special 

about 
winning 
this 
in-state 

rivalry game in East Lansing, 
he said. He didn’t do anything 
differently in preparation for 
Michigan State (0-5, 2-6). He just 
practiced well during the week, 
and Speight put the ball where it 
needed to be. That was enough to 
make the difference Saturday.

“He showed up to play,” said 

senior running back De’Veon 
Smith. “He made some great 
plays. I think he had two one-
handed 
grabs 
today. 
Hey, 

with the way the kid works at 
practice, it shows up on the field. 
He will give you 100 percent 
every single play.”

Though it isn’t easy by any 

means to lob a pass half a football 
field down the left sideline, it 
may be more challenging to 
trust your receivers to make a 
play. Speight showed no qualms 
about 
throwing 
to 
Darboh, 

allowing him to average 20.6 
yards per reception.

“There was a couple times 

here and there where they 
weren’t exactly open — they 
were covered — but when you’re 
throwing to guys like Jake Butt 
or Amara Darboh, that’s not 
really considered covered in the 
quarterback’s eyes,” Speight said. 
“I was able to throw them a couple 
of high balls because I knew they 
would be able to go and get it over 
the top of the corner.”

Darboh 
showed 
why 
he’s 

leading Michigan in receiving 
yards, making five catches for 
103 yards in the second quarter 
alone. 
Before 
the 
season, 

Harbaugh indicated that Darboh 
had become the Wolverines’ No. 
1 receiver.

Saturday’s 
performance 

illustrated why.

Freshman wide receiver Eddie McDoom made another big play in space on Saturday, a 33-yard rush on a reverse handoff from wildcat quarterback Jabrill Peppers.
