Young adult group 
presents 29th 
parade

Ann 
Arbor 
residents 
celebrated Independence Day 
with the 29th annual Fourth of 
July parade Thursday morning. 
The parade, run by the Ann 
Arbor Jaycees, the young adult 

offshoot of the Chamber of 
Commerce, began at 10 a.m. 
downtown.
Jaycees co-director Carolyn 
Walsh 
said 
in 
addition 
to 
building 
community 
and 
offering 
and 
outlet 
for 
celebrating the holiday, the 
festivities offer opportunities 
to learn more about community 
groups and nonprofits. Walsh 
noted there are more than 60 
community sponsors this year.
“It’s a really important event 
that 
binds 
the 
community 
together,” 
Walsh 
said. 
“On 
the Fourth of July, we have 
a lot to celebrate, and it gets 

the community engaged with 
different 
organizations 
and 
nonprofits.”
The Jaycees also host the 
summer carnival at Pioneer 
High 
School 
in 
late 
June 
each year. Walsh said their 
annual events have variation 
from year to year because the 
organization’s membership is 
always growing.
Walsh also said she hoped 
attendees learned more about 
the parade’s grand marshal, 
the Buddy-to Buddy-program.

City releases 
renewable car 
transition plan

Ann Arbor announces 
plan to make all
city vehicles
electric by 2025

The city of Ann Arbor aims to 
reduce its fleet-related fuel emissions 
in all city departments by 25 percent by 
2025. The goal is part of a partnership 
with the Climate Mayors Electric 
Vehicle Purchasing Collaborative — a 
group consisting of 127 cities, founded 
by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti 
in 2014 with the intent of accelerating 
climate 
progress 
through 
local 
governments. 
Missy 
Stults, 
Ann 
Arbor 
sustainability 
and 
innovations 
manager, said Ann Arbor joined 
the collaborative with the goal of 
fully powering all city vehicles with 
renewable 
energy. 
The 
city 
has 
implemented a Green Fleets program 
since 2004, but created a detailed 
and revised Green Fleets Policy with 
specific plans in 2018.
“For the city of Ann Arbor, we’ve 
got two goals that really made sense 
for joining the collaborative,” Stults 
said. “The first one is that we’ve got a 
Green Fleets Policy, which we’ve had 
since 2004, and in 2018, we upped 
the goal for our fleet that we want to 
reduce the emissions of our municipal 
fleets operation 25 percent by 2025. 
And then the other big goal is that 
our objective is to be powered, all 
municipal operations powered with 
100 percent clean and renewable 
energy by the year, at least, by the year 
2035.”
Stults discussed how a Green Fleets 
team is responsible for slowly phasing 
out the current vehicles with electric 
ones to maintain economic stability 
in Ann Arbor. She also noted the team 
monitors the market and the scientific 
progress of creating more elaborate 
electric vehicles, such as garbage 
trucks.

Carlson tenants allege negligence
Carlson Properties tenants express frustration with ownership

In a light brown duplex 
on 
South 
State 
Street, 
Kinesiology 
junior 
Emma 
Keer and her two roommates 
lived in their newly-signed 
two bedroom, two bathroom 
home 
during 
the 
2018-
2019 academic year. A few 
weeks 
after 
moving 
in, 
Keer’s dishwasher and dryer 
abruptly stopped working.

She tried to call landlord 
Garret Carlson, hoping to 
resolve the situation quickly, 
but said she kept getting sent to 
voicemail. Without any word 
that he had received her call, 
Carlson allegedly entered the 
property and began working 
on 
the 
appliances. 
Quite 
frequently, 
either 
Carlson 
or his maintenance worker 
would come into the property 
without any warning, Keer 
claims.
“He would walk in, do 

whatever, 
and 
obviously 
that wouldn’t sit well with 
us,” Keer said. “Three young 
girls, living alone, with a 
strange man coming into the 
apartment. We told him to 
email or give us a call when 
someone is coming over, but 
he said it was ‘too much work’ 
and that ‘he can’t call them, 
call you and then call them 
back because it was too hard 
to coordinate with them.’”

A2 siblings create 
signery after storm

‘U’ student, brother 
creates signs from 
materials wrecked 
in windstorm

After a straight-line windstorm 
carrying up to 100 miles per 
hour winds devastated Northern 
Michigan on Aug. 2, 2015, Ann 
Arbor siblings Bella and Zack Pryor 
felt inspired to take action. They 
started making wooden signs out 
of the old fences, broken docks and 
scraps of wood found in Glen Arbor 
and selling them — thus creating 
MichAgain Signery.
Bella, a Business sophomore at 
the University of Michigan, and her 
younger brother Zach, a junior at 
Pioneer High School, spend about 
three months each summer in Glen 
Arbor with their family. When the 
windstorm hit, they felt its impacts 
first-hand.

“We’ve been coming up to Glen 
Arbor, Michigan since we were 
born basically,” Bella Pryor said. 
“After the storm, there were a lot of 
trees down and just a lot of general 
devastation on the hiking trails and 
bike trails.”
Bella Pryor said wood such as 
docks, fences and farm structures 
had been damaged during the 
storm, and they did not want to let 
it all go to waste.
“We just decided to get a trailer 
and just load up some wood and 
bring it home,” she said. 
The Pryor siblings had an idea 
to use the wood from the storm to 
make wood signs representing the 
parts of Glen Arbor most special to 
them using design and art.
“What inspired us to make the 
signs in particular rather than other 
wood products was so that we could 
use art as a way to also express the 
beautiful areas that are in Northern 
Michigan,” Bella Pryor said.

Attendees 
participated in 
book swap, family 
friendly events

The Ypsilanti Freighthouse 
hosted 
the 
first 
annual 
Booksilanti Readers’ Fair on 
Saturday. 
The 
day-long 
fair 
featured book swaps, a market 
for local book shops and authors 
and child-friendly activities like 
story times and a bookmark-
making station. 
Black 
Stone 
Bookstore 
& 
Culture 
Center, 
located 
in 
downtown Ypsilanti, was one of 
the vendors at the event. As an 
African-American bookstore and 
cultural center, Black Stone sells 
books about African-American 
diaspora. The store also houses 
Black Men Read, a literacy 
program that works to normalize 
Blackness and highlight the 
cultural contributions of Black 
people 
through 
literature. 
Owner Kip Johnson said as an 
Ypsilanti native, he was thrilled 
at the chance to be a part of 
Booksilanti.
“How could I not be a vendor?” 
Johnson said. “Anything that’s 
dealing with literacy programs, 
dealing with Ypsilanti, you’ve 
got to come and support.”
Jessica Tapley, an attendee 
of the fair and self-proclaimed 
book lover, said she came to see 

the bookstores and artists and 
support vendors. She echoed 
Johnson’s sentiments about the 
fair being a space that highlights 
Ypsilanti’s 
community 
and 
culture.
“I thought it was really cool,” 
Tapley said. “I just like seeing 
the community of book lovers in 
Ypsi.”
According to Julie Palmer, 
the assistant events manager at 
the Ypsilanti Freighthouse and 
School of Literature, the event 
was meant to evoke the sense of 
community Johnson and Tapley 
both felt. Palmer, a University of 
Michigan alum, explained while 
a love of literature underlines 
Booksilanti, she wanted the 
event to reflect the diversity in 
Ypsilanti’s communities. 
“In true, unique Ypsi style, 
we wanted to highlight the best 
and brightest from our own 
community,” Palmer said. “There 
began some fun brainstorming 
and just new ideas about how 
we could celebrate many aspects 
that are tied to a love of books, 
whether 
it’s 
reading 
books, 
buying books… All of that was 
what we wanted to bring here.”
Palmer also hopes Booksilanti 
will help draw the already 
close-knit Ypsilanti community 
together.
“My personal hope is that 
they experience joy, community, 
connection, and that we continue 
to fuel their love of reading, their 
love of books,” Palmer said.

In early June, the Humane 
Society 
of 
Huron 
Valley 
noticed “strange” behavior 
starting to occur frequently 
among 
the 
raccoons 
and 
skunks of Washtenaw County. 
The group said they received 
numerous calls from con-
cerned residents and docu-
mented a 45 percent increase 
in sick wildlife being treated 
by their facilities since the 
beginning of the year.
On June 6, HSHV pub-
lished a press release to notify 
the public. In the release, 
HSHV CEO Tanya Hilgendorf 
was quoted in the press release 
saying there was a presumed 
outbreak of distemper and 
parvovirus in the community.
“We don’t want to cause 
alarm, but this gives rise to 
an important reminder to 
keep your pets up to date on 
vaccines and be very careful 
where you go with puppies 
who haven’t yet been fully vac-
cinated and older animals with 
weaker immune systems,” Hil-
gendorf said.
Distemper and parvovi-
rus are not a threat to human 

immune systems, but can be 
fatal for unvaccinated, very 
young or very old animals. 
Though more common in 
dogs, other house pets such 
as cats may contract either 
virus through contact with the 
infected animals, resulting in 
serious gastrointestinal and 
neurological problems.
HSHV 
communications 
director Wendy Welch said 
the release was issued just 
as a reminder for pet owners 
to vaccinate their compan-
ion animals as the diseases in 
question are easily prevent-
able.
“All of our services are to 
keep people with their com-
panion animals and serve the 
animals and people in our 
community,” Welch said.
Since the release, Welch 
said there has been a decrease 
in calls from concerned resi-
dents and an uptick in pet vac-
cinations.
Welch said she has not 
worked on anything similar 
recently, but she and Molly 
Tamulevich, Michigan State 
director for the Humane Soci-
ety of the United States, both 
said they are not uncommon.
“These outbreaks pop up 

time to time … and sometimes 
there’s an increase in report-
ing, especially with areas 
with a really high population 
density, where you might just 
have an increase in reports,” 
Tamulevich said.
Tamulevich, an Ann Arbor 
native, attributes this out-
break and others like it to the 
increase of “urban wildlife,” 
animals who adapt to the city 
infrastructure built around 
them.
“As 
our 
communities 
sometimes encroach into hab-
itats, we sometimes displace 
wildlife, and that wildlife can 
either thrive alongside human 
beings or not thrive alongside 
human beings,” Tamulevich 
said. “Some species — rac-
coons, possums, sometimes 
even coyotes — they do well 
because human beings often 
provide them with intention-
al or unintentional sources of 
food. Wildlife has been exist-
ing in human settlements for 
thousands of years, but in a 
city like Ann Arbor, you have 
healthy populations of squir-
rels, rabbits, raccoons, pos-
sums, and they live alongside 
us and within dense human 
centers.”

Welch agreed and said resi-
dents’ have a responsibility 
to respect the animals living 
among them.
“There’s a whole ‘phenom-
enon’ of urban wildlife, and 
as we develop as humans and 
live closer and closer to wild-
life spaces, we encroach on 
animals,” Welch said. “It’s 
definitely affecting them, and 
we need to take into account 
where they live and how we 
want to live.”
Welch said raccoons and 
skunks are commonly the 
“victims” of diseases, such as 
this spring’s outbreaks of dis-
temper and parvovirus. Addi-
tionally, Welch said spring, 
which is birthing season for 
these animals, is the time of 
the year most susceptible to 
such an outbreak.
Tamulevich advised con-
cerned pet owners to engage 
in 
“common-sense” 
prac-
tices which prevent animal 
encroachment on their prop-
erty. This “preventative main-
tenance” 
includes 
feeding 
animals inside and clearing 
brush.

Rackham student Rima 
Fadlallah and U-M Dear-
born alum Yasmeen Kadouh, 
both Dearborn natives, cre-
ated the podcast “Dearborn 
Girl” to challenge stereo-
types about themselves and 
women in the community 
they call home.
Fadlallah and Kadouh said 
they heard people express 
concern about both leaving 
and staying within their city. 
Some attributed this to a lack 
of spaces for women to speak 
freely among each other and 
nearly everyone they have 
talked to said they shared the 
stereotype of the “Dearborn 
girl.”
“For many in and outside 
Dearborn, the term means 
that the girl is uncivilized, 
loud and obnoxious, some-
one who doesn’t experience 
Arab culture outside of Dear-
born,” Fadlallah said.
In December, with the 
purpose of capturing these 
exchanges, Kadouh and Fad-
lallah filed into the Detroit 
Foundation Hotel in Dear-
born to record a pilot podcast 
episode. The hotel offered 
their audio equipment free of 
cost for a two-hour time slot 
every week. After learning 
how to use the complimen-
tary audio equipment and 
recording their tester, they 
decided to embark on the 
journey of creating a com-
munity driven podcast — an 
attempt to create a space 
for women in Dearborn to 
address their life experienc-
es while reclaiming the term. 
What started as a podcast 
idea has turned into a much 

larger project. “Dearborn 
Girl” expanded to videogra-
phy and has 2,656 followers 
on Instagram after only one 
season of production. Malak 
Wazne, Dearborn filmmak-
er and Henry Ford College 
sophomore, caught wind of 
their project and immedi-
ately wanted to join their 
mission.
“I have always been pas-
sionate about storytelling. 
After Rima and Yasmeen 
interviewed me on the pod-
cast about my film and photo 
career, I knew this project 
was something I wanted to 
be a part of,” Wazne said. 
“Shortly after putting our 
skills and passion together, 
it became more evident that 
‘Dearborn Girl’ was much 
larger than any one individ-
ual.”
After a few recording ses-
sions, Fadlallah and Kadouh 
realized they had enough 
audio to produce a full sea-
son of 10 episodes with extra 
to spill into a second season. 
On May 22, an audience of 
150 attended the Arab Amer-
ican National Museum to 
listen to their debut episode, 
titled #proudlyaDG.
In the first episode, Har-
vard graduate Mariam Jal-
loul spoke of her transition 
from the Ivy League back to 
Dearborn. In 2016, she gave 
the commencement speech 
for her graduating class at 
Harvard, and, while it was 
a significant moment for her 
and her family, she said she 
returned to the Dearborn 
community to typical ques-
tions.

L

ast month, Americans were 
treated to the first debates 
among the incredibly large 
field 
of 
Democratic 
presidential 
candidates. 
There 
are 
so 
many 
candidates that the debates were split 
into two nights — one on Wednesday, 
the other Thursday, with 10 candidates 
each. I tuned into both debates, 
expecting some laughs, some memes, 
some 
surprising 
breakout 
stars. 
Thankfully, I got all of that: laughs 
from Marianne Willamson’s confusing 
presence, memes from Beto’s Spanish 
moment and standout performances 
from Cory Booker and Julián Castro. 
Above all, though, I came out with two 
powerful emotions: frustration and 
anger. Frustration that former Vice 
President Joe Biden is leading in the 
polls despite a questionable political 
past and no new ideas, and anger that 
some people on the Democratic side 
believe that a moderate is what’s best 
for this country.
In my view, Biden appeals to people 
for two reasons alone: his connection to 
Obama, and his position as a moderate. 
Yet with the Democratic Party moving 
left, Biden’s policy proposals, or truly, 
his lack thereof, are tired and worn 
out — he is so desperately riding the 
coattails of the Obama administration. 
I could dedicate all 1,000 of my words 
to why we deserve better than Joe 
Biden, but this is a column not just 
on politics, but pop culture as well. 
So I’m going to do perhaps the most 
glaringly Gen Z thing I could possibly 
do: compare the 2020 Democrats to 
contestants on “The Bachelorette.”
I have just recently started watching 
“The Bachelorette,” but it is exactly 
the type of high-drama, low-brain 

power television that makes my heart 
soar. Hannah Brown and her harem 
of men is also strikingly reminiscent 
of the current Democratic race to 
the presidency. I don’t know which 
part of the show is most similar to the 
race: The fact that everyone’s chasing 
after someone from middle America 
as if they stand a chance or the sheer 
magnitude of indistinguishable white 
men. There’s also a central enemy 
— if Trump was a “Bachelorette” 
contestant, he would be Luke P. He is 
a manipulative, misogynist, toxic man 
that nobody likes but everybody can’t 
stop talking about, and he keeps getting 
put through by a voter from Alabama. 
You hope to God that he doesn’t win, 
but your past has jaded you, and your 
lack of trust in the process makes you 
the slightest bit worried he just might 
pull it off. 
On the opposite end of the spectrum, 
there’s Tyler C. — sweet, respectful 
and smart, Tyler is my Elizabeth 
Warren figure. He works with multiple 
charities and only wants what’s best 
for Hannah, even if it’s not what’s best 
for him. He’s almost too good for the 
show, and most people know that he 
should be the obvious winner. I can 
only imagine Tyler would tax the ultra-
rich, forgive student debt, support the 
Green New Deal and support the rights 
of women, minorities and the LGBTQ+ 
community. 
To round out this scale, let’s throw 
in Jed. Jed looks good on the surface, 
he’s got everything you think the 
perfect winner would have. But Jed is 
hardly the most endearing guy on “The 
Bachelorette,” and Biden doesn’t even 
break my top five candidates. Take a 
peek under the surface, and there’s a 

darker side. Surprise! Biden opposed 
bussing, voted for Iraq and failed to be 
fair to Anita Hill. Almost as bad, Jed 
had a girlfriend when he joined the 
show and admitted to only going on it 
to promote his mediocre country music. 
This may be lighthearted, but I stand 
by my analogy. Shouldn’t we expect as 
much from our presidential candidates 
as we do from random men looking for 
love? Democrats and liberals have to 
learn from their past and their mistakes. 
If a woman isn’t appealing to voters, then 
why did a woman win the popular vote? 
If America won’t vote for someone too 
far left, why is every candidate talking 
about the Green New Deal, Medicare 
for All and free college tuition? How 
can we just go back to the way it was 
in the Obama Administration, when 
the world has changed since then and 
politics in America will probably never 
be the same? 
Biden insists that if he beats Trump, 
Republicans will be willing to work 
with him. He says this as if the blockage 
of Merrick Garland never occurred, as 
if the right isn’t gleefully stripping away 
human rights, as if partisan politics 
hasn’t shifted from disagreements 
over taxation to fighting over whether 
children should have access to soap. 
The bigoted foundation of this country 
is not going to disappear alongside its 
president, it will fight and it will fester, 
growing stronger in the absence of 
validation. We need a disruption, not a 
return to the past.

Hot take: the Fourth 
of July sucks. Before 
the comments section swells 
with 
beer-drunk, 
barbecue-
stained 
American 
spirit 
to 
chastise me, I am a patriot. I 
love pigging out on burgers 
and lathering on suntan lotion 
to celebrate the soldiers that 
fought in the dead cold with 
little to no food for our free-
dom. Sorry, I gave no warning 
— that was sarcasm. And burg-
ers and suntan lotion might 
not be dangerously ironic, but 
this is: Our national holiday of 
independence centers around 
the 
biggest 
post 
traumatic 
stress disorder trigger imagin-
able — fireworks — in the same 
month that we are supposedly 
celebrating 
minority 
mental 
health awareness and veter-
ans, a group of people highly 
susceptible to developing post 
traumatic stress disorder. Yes, 
July is Minority Mental Health 
Awareness Month. Surprise!
The final twist of the ironic 
blade — admittedly, a per-
sonal one — is that as a fourth 
grader, on Independence Day, 
a classmate of mine named 
Billy Brown told me I was 
not an American because I’m 
brown. I said, “You’re Brown, 
too,” though I didn’t realize 
last names wasn’t what he was 
talking about. Now I know, 
screw Billy Brown. But as a 
fourth grader, that realization 
sent me spiraling and shaped 
how I view myself today. And 
today I’m validated by what? 
A July dedicated to awareness 
about the mental health issues 
of someone like me — issues 
that, personally, arose in July 
on a day that is supposed to cel-
ebrate all Americans, but left 
me feeling as un-American as 
ever? No, I’m validated by the 
fact that Billy Brown went to 
jail on cocaine possession nine 
years later. Catharsis never felt 
so good. 
Let’s talk about more facts. 
The Fourth of July used to be 
a holiday celebrating American 
diversity, not American patrio-
tism or freedom or whatever we 
claim it celebrates now. Post-
Civil War freed slaves claimed 
the holiday in 1865, at the end 
of the Civil War. And so, for a 
few years, the Fourth of July 
was a Black holiday, celebrat-
ing emancipation and equality. 

But sadly, during the post-war 
period in which Black Ameri-
cans were grappling for a sense 
of unity, community and equal-
ity, segregationists began to 
reclaim the holiday, barring 
public celebrations in predomi-
nantly African American com-
munities. By 1902, the spectacle 
that took place on the Fourth in 
Atlanta was filled with white 
floats and white speakers to 
place an emphasis on what 
kind of American the Fourth 
was celebrating — an ideal that 
doesn’t exactly describe those 
that look like me. 

Back to Minority Mental 
Health Month. The necessity 
of formalizing a month to focus 
on issues of mental health in 
minority communities cannot 
be overstated, so I’m stating 
it. I’ll offer a trigger warning 
before my quick digression, 
as much of this stuff needs to 
be said but doesn’t necessarily 
need to be heard: LGTBQ+ per-
sons are 2.5 times more likely 
to experience depression, anxi-
ety or a mental disorder than 
heterosexual persons. One in 
six gay men attempt suicide at 
least once in their lifetime. 30.8 
percent of transgender-identi-
fying persons have considered 
suicide. Non-whites actually 
report lower levels of depres-
sion than their white coun-
terparts, but that’s a fact that 
can easily be misconstrued. A 
staggering 48 percent of white 
people, compared to 31 per-
cent of African Americans and 
Hispanics, and 22 percent of 
Asians, receive mental health 
care. And to be diagnosed with 
a mental disorder, one has to 
receive care first, so MMHAM 
is clearly a necessity that must 
be promoted further — espe-
cially because the self-care and 
#thrivingnotsurviving 
move-
ments that have swept through 
this country in the past 10 years 

seem to be disproportionately 
representative. 
And finally, why July? The 
Fourth of July is a day marred 
by a history of discriminatory 
tension and violence, so why, 
four days into the awareness 
month, do we want to under-
mine minority sense of self-
belonging with a holiday that 
hasn’t 
historically 
reflected 
everyone’s values? Because the 
Fourth of July doesn’t seem like 
a holiday particularly inclined 
to date-related changes, then 
perhaps we should think about 
moving MMHAM. Or at least 
think about providing and, 
more importantly, advertising 
adequate and affordable sup-
port systems for those on the 
Fourth of July who may feel 
outcast, misrepresented or sub-
jugated. In order to keep up 
with the equality and health 
ideals we’re supposed to be 
able to uphold for at least one 
month. Maybe all the other 
months 
are 
already 
taken, 
so MMHAM took the only 
remaining cell in the govern-
ment’s “What can this month 
be for?” Excel spreadsheet. But 
adequate resources and aware-
ness campaigns can’t afford to 
be hindered by bureaucratic 
bottlenecks like the slightly 
more arbitrary designation of 
which month we should “be 
aware” in. 
So if MMHAM is going to 
stay July, we need to put more 
effort into actually making peo-
ple aware of the resources that 
are available to them, because 
I’ve had this metallic umami 
of “another thing done just to 
placate the electorate” settling 
onto my taste buds since this 
month started. This is in addi-
tion to the sharp sour of “little 
Billy Brown is trying to take 
my crown” that starts to wax 
nostalgic around the Fourth of 
July. Huh, ironic. Tastes like 
bleach. 
Final note on Billy Brown: 
He’s fine. He’s a white male 
from a suburb of Milwaukee. 
Nothing was ever going to hap-
pen to him. He got a day in 
“jail,” then was released. It’s 
not even on the books. He did 
a month of community service. 
He is currently going to UCSB. 
But I’m over it.

I’m struggling with July

n his time as president, Donald 
Trump has continually used 
inflammatory rhetoric to stake 
out his political positions, from calling 
climate change a hoax to labeling news 
coverage he doesn’t like as “fake news.” 
However, Trump’s most aggressive 
outbursts are consistently focused on 
immigration. This makes sense: Since 
the very beginning of his campaign, 
Trump has made restricting Latin 
American immigration at any cost his 
number one priority. Interestingly, 
despite Trump’s xenophobic rants 
and inhumane policies, immigration 
levels have soared since he took office. 
Though this may seem contradictory, 
it serves to highlight how Trump and 
the Republican Party fundamentally 
do not understand immigration in the 
modern world.
While Trump has aggressively 
pushed to strengthen the border and 
deter immigrants from coming into the 
U.S., immigration policy extends far 
beyond the border itself. What Trump 
fails to understand is that immigration 
is not a standalone issue that is dealt 
with exclusively at the border. In real-
ity, immigration is deeply intertwined 
with America’s geopolitical relation-
ships, foreign aid decisions and climate 
policy. Reforming immigration policy 
in any meaningful way requires work-
ing with those issues as well.
Before diving into other issues, it is 
important to point out that Trump’s 
aggressive immigration policies — 
aimed at deterring migrants from 
attempting the journey to the United 
States — are likely not particularly 
effective. As a study published in the 
Stanford Law Review Journal ear-
lier this year, that specifically looked 
at immigration, explains; “criminal 
deterrence literature suggests that 
people generally do not know the law, 
are bad at rational decision-making, 
and even if they can make rational 
decisions, will choose to commit the 
crime because the perceived benefits 
often outweigh the perceived costs.” 
This analysis points out several key 
holes in Trump’s deterrence-centric 
immigration policies, mainly that 
immigrants often don’t know how 
Trump’s actual immigration policies 
legally differ from past plans. How-
ever, the most important part of the 
quote is the concluding section, a line 
that hints at the fundamental flaw of 
handling immigration as an isolated 
issue: Oftentimes, the situations immi-
grants are leaving behind supercede 
worries about American immigration 
policies. 
Global conditions have a major 
impact on immigration flow, which 
ties a whole host of American policies 

directly to the issue. Today, one of the 
most important factors driving migra-
tion is climate change. Many Central 
American countries, including Hondu-
ras and Guatemala, have large farming 
populations which suffer greatly as 
climate change destabilizes weather, 
limiting growing seasons and cutting 
into profits. Across the region, farmers 
are being forced to grow less lucrative 
crops, change their farming practices 
or simply not make money. With their 
economic prospects hobbled, many 
farmers are forced to migrate north 
to America and look for better-paying 
work. 
The United States’s huge carbon out-
put, the highest per capita in the world, 
has helped create this predicament. 
Though American climate change 
policy (to the extent it exists) largely 
focuses on problems facing the United 
States, American emissions have a 
global impact, as exemplified by this 
situation. The logical response to this 
crisis would be to pass common-sense 
climate protection laws. In the past, 
the United States even sent American 
farming experts to Central America to 
help farmers mitigate the effects of cli-
mate change on their crops.
However, in addition to railing 
against immigrants, President Trump 
has simultaneously worked to sys-
tematically destroy and undermine 
American climate protection efforts, 
subsequently displacing the same Cen-
tral American migrants he talks down 
upon. America, with Trump at the 
helm, has failed to take responsibility 
for the role its irresponsible climate 
policies have played in creating this 
wave of migration.
Another key issue which impacts 
migration flows is relations between 
the United States and Central America 
— particularly with respect to foreign 
aid. Many Central American countries 
struggle with gang violence, corrup-
tion and poverty, all of which are major 
factors pushing immigrants towards 
the United States. Ideally, the U.S. 
would combat this by providing aid to 
assist with these predicaments, help-
ing ensure that Central American citi-
zens feel safe in their home countries. 
Instead, Trump has taken the opposite 
route: Earlier this year, he drastically 
cut aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and 
Honduras. This was a dangerous move 
which will only worsen the conditions 
in Central America, driving more and 
more citizens to try and flee. 

Immigration is not a standalone issue

“You can never publish my love,” 
Rogue Wave chants, in the song that 
the title of this series riffs on. Maybe 
that’s true, and we can never quite 
account for our love on paper or in 
print, but we sure can try. That’s what 
this series is devoted to: publishing our 
love. Us, the Arts section of The Michi-
gan Daily, talking about artists, some 
of the people we love the most. Perhaps 
these are futile approximations of love 
for the poet who told us we deserve to 
be heard, the director who changed the 
way we see the world, the singer we 
see as an old friend. But who ever said 
futile can’t still be beautiful?
[An homage to David Foster Wal-
lace’s “David Lynch Keeps his Head.”]
1. WHO THIS ARTICLE IS 
ABOUT
To date, Writer/Director Wes 
Anderson has made nine feature 
films, four short films and three high-
ly stylized commercials. He has been 
nominated for seven Oscars — those 
being two for Best Animated Feature, 
three for Best Original Screenplay 
and one each of Best Picture and Best 
Director — though he has won none. 
A Wes Anderson piece is known by its 
unique pastel, tableaux style and its 
melancholic, deadpan humor. Ander-
son has been referred to as one of the 
few actively working ‘auteurs,’ a term 
associated with historic filmmakers 
like Mike Nichols, Luis Buñuel and 

Jean-Luc Goddard.
1(A). THE FOOTNOTE FOR SEC-
TION 1
The three directors listed as 
examples of ‘auteurs’ were chosen 
only half-arbitrarily, each of these 
three artists having lent something to 
Anderson’s films somewhere over the 
course of his twenty-six-year career. 
A hundred names of filmmakers 
from the last seventy years could have 
been swapped in or swapped out to fit 
this label. Auteur is a fairly vaunted 
title, but it’s really just a fancy way 
to describe a filmmaker who is inti-
mately involved in the entire creative 
process, from the very inception 
of the idea to the last cuts in post-
production — an artist who retains a 
near autocratic level of control over 
all aspects of the film. The term origi-
nated in the sixties during the French 
New Wave as a way to classify direc-
tors who operated outside the Hol-
lywood establishment, though this 
particular distinction has been all but 
lost over the years.
2. ENTERTAINMENTS WES 
ANDERSON HAS MADE THAT 
ARE MENTIONED IN THIS ARTI-
CLE
“Bottle Rocket” (1996), “Rush-
more” (1998), “The Royal Tenen-
baums” (2001), “The Life Aquatic 
with Steve Zissou” (2004), “Hotel 
Chevalier” (2007), “The Darjeel-
ing Limited” (2007), “Fantastic Mr. 
Fox” (2009), “Moonrise Kingdom” 
(2012), “CASTELLO CAVALCANTI” 
(2013), “The Grand Budapest Hotel” 
(2014), “Come Together” (2016) “Isle 

of Dogs” (2018)
3. THE DIRECTOR’S BACK-
GROUND AND OTHER WIKIPE-
DIA-ISH STUFF
Wes Anderson was born in Hous-
ton, Texas in 1969 to an archeologist 
and a father who worked in adver-
tising. His parents separated and 
divorced when he was eight years old, 
the event deeply affecting the young 
boy. Anderson made silent films with 
his Dad’s Super 8 camera as a child, 
using his friends and brothers as cast 
and crew. Anderson attended the 
University of Texas at Austin after 
graduating high school. There he 
pursued a philosophy degree while 
working part time as a cinema pro-
jectionist.
At school he took as many play-
writing classes as he had time for, 
meeting his future creative partner 
Owen Wilson in one of these classes 
in his second year. Anderson and 
Wilson became roommates, bonding 
over their love for directors like Cas-
savetes, Malick and Huston, as well 
as their shared desire to create. The 
duo made their first short film “Bot-
tle Rocket” together in 1993, when 
Anderson was twenty-four. The short 
made it to Sundance, word-of-mouth 
eventually landing them a five-mil-
lion-dollar deal for their first feature 
by the same name.
Anderson has an older brother 
Mel who works as a physician, and a 
younger brother Eric who works as 
a writer and artist. Eric’s paintings 
have appeared in many of his broth-
er’s films, most notably as the water-

color movie-poster for Anderson’s 
second film, “Rushmore.” Anderson 
married Lebanese writer Juman 
Malouf in 2010. The couple had a 
daughter, Freya, in 2016. Anderson 
has lived in Paris for many years.
4. THE PART THAT WAS SUP-
POSED TO BE THE WHOLE ARTI-
CLE
“Fantastic Mr. Fox” came out 
when I was ten years old, and I prob-
ably saw it a year or two afterward. 
I remember finding it to be mostly 
strange and off-putting. The taxider-
my-like puppets and their off-kilter 
family banter was a departure from 
the easily comedic Aardman Clay-
mation film’s I’d adored as a kid (spe-
cific devotion paid to “Chicken Run” 
and “Wallace and Gromit: A Grand 
Day Out”). And though I don’t think 
I immediately got it, “Mr. Fox” had 
my curiosity piqued. I got the sense 
that this kids movie trusted me a little 
more as a viewer, that there was more 
to this fantastical 
forest than I could 
then see — there 
was a dramatic tex-
ture to the movie 
that most family 
flicks go without. 
Having 
gorged 
myself on two “Toy 
Story” movies and 
a “Shrek” sequel, 
I was left forever 
waiting for the “Mr. 
Fox” sequel that 
never came.
I ran into Ander-
son next at the 2015 
Academy Awards, where “The Grand 
Budapest Hotel” was nominated 
for nine Oscars, winning four. I was 
reluctant to stay up late, knowing I’d 
be tired at school the next day, but I 
couldn’t pull myself away from the 
screen. What was this funny looking 
pink-and-purple comedy that kept 
getting nominated next to “Whip-
lash” and “Birdman?” Considering 
myself to be a high-brow ticket-buyer 
at the time, I stuck to Iñárritu and 
didn’t explore “Grand Budapest” any 
further.
Two years later, during my senior 
year of high school I made a docu-
mentary for a C-SPAN student com-
petition. My team and I were struck 
by how creative the previous year’s 
winner had been with her film (my 
then, and continued, understand-
ing of C-SPAN as synonymous with 
parched). Convinced we needed to 
spice our direction up a bit, we hunt-
ed for fresh inspiration. It was a piece 
of algorithmic, targeted-marketing, 
divine intervention that brought to 
my YouTube feed the H&M commer-
cial “Come Together” that Anderson 
had made that year (that week, even). 

I was instantly enamored, watching 
“Come Together” and his previous 
Prada advertisement “CASTELLO 
CAVALCANTI” on repeat the rest 
of the school day. I showed both the 
films to my documentary co-conspir-
ators and suddenly we had our muse. 
That was a Monday. By Saturday 
night I had watched every Anderson 
film, short and advert to date.
4(A). WHY THIS TYPE OF ARTI-
CLE MAKES ME UNCOMFORT-
ABLE
I’ve found trying to nail down 
exactly 
why 
something 
is/was 
important to me is a tall order. I was 
surprised by this. I didn’t think it 
would be all that different to what 
I’ve written before, but designing 
this article was difficult, a frustrat-
ing process for me. I think the exer-
cise of repackaging into tight, punchy 
sentences my admiration for an art-
ist that has sprawled out of control 
makes me nervous that I’m going to 
leave 
something 
out, or not do that 
admiration justice. 
I pity my friends, 
family and associ-
ates who had to live 
through my Ander-
son phase, as it was 
all-consuming. 
It 
was 
quotes 
and 
Wes-only chit-chat 
and a subconscious 
structured in plani-
metrically framed 
dolly slides — I fan-
boyed to an embar-
rassing 
extent. 
Wrapping that all up into a nice little 
article-essay feels like a mountainous 
task, fear of misrepresenting both the 
artist and the late 2016/early 2017 ver-
sion of myself always looming large.
I also have doubts about how 
worthy of an article my affection 
is. When planning this article out, I 
was anxious about the threat of hid-
ing the artist too much, when, really, 
I think this should be about them. I 
feel much more comfortable writ-
ing a piece about the reasons for my 
affection toward a work of art rather 
than the affection itself. The end 
goal, I think, is to motivate some-
one else to give it a try. So, maybe, if 
they’re lucky, they’ll have a similar 
experience to mine. Then the purest, 
most sincere version of this article 
is probably one line: Go watch “The 
Royal Tenenbaums.” Experience 
it for yourself. Walk into it with an 
open mind, and maybe you’ll find 
your entire sense of what a movie is/
can be changed by the time you read 
“Directed by Wes ANDERSON.”

“Hereditary” director Ari Aster 
has been very open about the fact 
that his latest film venture, “Mid-
sommar,” is at its core a breakup 
movie. This revelation probably 
comes as a surprise to anyone who’s 
heard of the movie, but hasn’t actu-
ally seen it. Its marketing campaign 
has focused on depicting the pagan 
cult ceremony the central charac-
ters find themselves participating 
in, which ultimately becomes a hor-
rifying spectacle of shocking vio-
lence and breathtaking, sun-soaked 
imagery. And while at its surface 
“Midsommar” is exactly that, over 
its 147-minute runtime the film 
reveals itself to be so much more. 
“Midsommar” 
follows 
Dani 
(Florence Pugh, “Lady Macbeth”), a 
young college student struggling to 
cope with the murder-suicide that 
claimed the lives of her sister and 
her parents. Alongside this, Dani 
is also working to salvage her rela-
tionship with her boyfriend Chris-
tian (Jack Reynor, “What Richard 
Did”), a relationship neither of them 
are fully sure they want to save. The 
two find themselves travelling with 
Christian’s academically minded 
friends to Sweden to witness a 
midsummer tradition taking place 
among the fictional Hårga people, 
whose celebration takes place only 
once every 90 years. Their inno-
cent, well meaning anthropological 
investigation results in bloodshed, 
sex and a climax no one could have 
expected. 
It’s nearly impossible to think 

about “Midsommar” without con-
sidering its predecessor, “Heredi-
tary,” a film so admired and beloved 
it’s been given the distinction by 
many of being a “modern horror 
masterpiece.” To be sure, the two 
films share several uncanny simi-
larities. Both examine the depths of 
grief, both find horror in paganistic 
religious rituals, both are carried 
by Oscar-worthy lead performanc-
es from Florence Pugh and Toni 
Collette, respectively. 
That’s just about where the simi-
larities end. “Midsommar” distin-
guishes itself from “Hereditary” 
by embracing an entirely differ-

ent approach to instilling fear in 
its viewers. For one, the two could 
not be more aesthetically opposed. 
In “Hereditary,” a substantial por-
tion of the central action takes 
place in the dark, allowing evil to 
lurk and sneak up on characters 
in unexpected places, whereas the 
vast majority of “Midsommar” 
transpires under an oppressive 
and nearly blinding sun. There’s 
nowhere for anyone to hide, which 
is both comforting and terrifying. 
The film’s literal brightness forc-
es us to take in its horrors with a 
shocking clarity. 
“Midsommar” further separates 
itself by embracing a technique 

that’s wholly absent from the lat-
ter film: comedy. With Will Poul-
ter (“Black Mirror: Bandersnatch”) 
serving as a fairly consistent source 
of comedic relief, “Midsommar” 
deliberately disorients our expec-
tations of what watching a horror 
film should feel like. The thrill-
ingly messy concoction of horror, 
relationship drama and comedy 
that constitutes “Midsommar” cre-
ates an overall tonal inconsistency 
that actually serves to its advan-
tage, generating an uncomfortable 
and unpredictable atmosphere. No 
other movie feels quite like it. 
Perhaps the thing that most dis-
tinguishes “Midsommar” from its 
predecessor is that the star of the 
film is not its protagonist. Its star 
is the world it creates and culture 
that exists within it. In an inter-
view with Slate, Aster remarks, 
“Life is suffering. I agree with that, 
and I think it’s therapeutic to give 
expression to that … there’s also this 
high-minded part of me that wants 
to do it in the most elegant way pos-
sible. That’s where this (Midsom-
mar) comes from.” “Elegant” is 
precisely the adjective that comes 
to mind when I think of how Aster 
presents the Hårga people. Their 
ceremony becomes a hypnotic blur 
of earth and sky and flower crowns 
and immaculate whiteness that’s as 
nauseating as it is beautiful. It lures 
you in and doesn’t let go. 
“Midsommar” is not “Heredi-
tary.” It’s not trying to be. “Mid-
sommar” is a spectacularly shot 
and surprisingly hilarious experi-
ment in immersive filmmaking that 
without question deserves a spot 
alongside “Hereditary” in the art-
house horror canon.

FILM REVIEW

A24

When I first opened my copy 
“Stonebreaker” by Peter Wart-
man last week, I pursued it as I 
would any other graphic novel. 
I flipped through to admire the 
artwork, marvel at the color 
scheme, take in the very mid-’10s 
style animation. I read it cover to 
cover, fully engrossed in its dys-
topian sci-fi appeal. Then I took 
to Google to gain more insight 
on what exactly makes Wartman 
and his “Stonebreaker” protago-
nist Anya tick.
A skim at the second link 
brought my attention to the glossy 
black “Book 2” 
label across both 
front and back 
covers and the 
spine. I sighed 
as I immediately 
took to hunting 
down its prede-
cessor “Over the 
Wall,” a graphic 
novel that, con-
veniently for me, was initially 
published serially online on Ship-
wrecked Planet. Although I ini-
tially found the task of going back 
and forth between the two novels 
tedious, this provided me better 
insight into how “Stonebreaker” 
came to be and what it represents, 
independent of its predecessor.
Set four years apart, “Over the 
Wall” and “Stonebreaker” detail 
the adventures of Anya, a heroine 
living in a fictional, post-apoca-
lyptic metropolis called Noridun, 
forbidden to women and separat-
ed from the countryside by a wall. 
Whereas “Over the Wall” warms 
us up to the dystopian backdrop 
and Anya’s aim to find her miss-
ing brother she can’t remember, 
“Stonebreaker” jumps headfirst 
into Anya’s desire to recover both 
his and her missing memories — 
her brother doesn’t even remem-
ber his own name. 
Rather than embarking on this 
adventure out of sheer familial 
commitment, we realize early on 
that she’s older (16, to be exact) 
and more assured of herself 
this time around. The threat of 

deadly demons looms over a care-
less Anya, who aspires to defy 
the concerns and expectations 
of those around her. Despite the 
arduous task of saving her broth-
er in the last novel, everyone 
from her father to the friendly 
demon Toris doubts her ability to 
make it through another adven-
ture. She nonetheless perseveres 
through the doubt cast on her 
and strives to defy the odds. This 
inevitably places her in the same 
dilemmas she faced years ago as 
she wrestles with the tension of 
memories and reality, hoping to 
find answers she suspects and 
believes to be true without any 
formal indicators. 
The magic of “Stonebreak-
er” presents itself in the way it 
evolves 
from 
its 
predecessor. 
Thematically 
speaking, 
Anya 
finds herself in 
the 
same 
pre-
dicaments 
she 
faced in the last 
book, from the 
grand desire to 
help her brother 
to the more abstract question 
of what she’ll move on to in her 
future. Wartman, however, is 
able to wrap these ideas into more 
mature packaging as we follow an 
older Anya in her ever-evolving 
town with some new characters 
— it’s not just Anya’s story this 
time around. Intersecting her 
narrative is the orange-paneled 
adventures of Kohjen and Bara-
dei, two outsiders from Tatchan 
seeking mysterious focus stones.
They too are familiar with the 
“Stonebreaker” myth as told in 
the beginning of the text through 
Anya’s flashbacks to memories of 
her grandmother. The myth itself 
circles around the ancient begin-
nings of Noridun as a civilization 
and its cruel demon leader, Stone-
breaker, and what became of him. 
Intersecting with this plot is the 
backstory of Toris in the form of 
flashbacks from a past life that 
scatter his memories sporadically 
throughout the pages in pale blue 
paneling.

Later in the year around mid-
February, Keer heard an unsolicited 
knock on her door followed by 
the turning of the door handle. 
Without notice, Carlson allegedly 
entered her property. This time, 
Keer said she decided to speak up. 
“I told him all that we wanted 
just a phone call to let us know in 

case someone wants to shower or 
if no one was home,” Keer said. 
“He got up and started yelling at 
me and waving his hand in my face 
and stormed out of the apartment 
and slammed the door behind him. 
It was the most unprofessional 
interaction I’ve ever witnessed, 
and my roommates and I were 
absolutely shocked. We talked to 
him the next day, and I told him 
to never raise his hands in my 
face again because we felt very 
threatened. He never emailed back 

and did not respond to any of our 
questions for the rest of the year, 
even when the dishwasher was 
leaking and there was a bird in our 
apartment.”
Until the last few weeks of the 
year, Keer said Carlson ignored 
her and her roommates’ phone 
calls and emails, which Keer 
thought was because he was 
upset by the February altercation. 
When Keer’s lease was about 
to 
end 
before 
her 
and 
her 
roommates finished their finals, 

one roommate decided to ask 
Carlson to stay a few extra days 
to finish out the semester. For the 
first time in months, said Keer, 
Carlson responded. 
“He replied something like, 
‘given the way I was treated over 
the last year, I have no interest in 
letting you stay,’” Keer said. “But 
my roommate’s aunt is a lawyer, 
so she called him and he let us 
stay for three extra days — which 
was good — but that was pretty 
much all the communication we 
had with him toward the end. 
Although it was an unfortunate 
situation, there wasn’t anything 
that could be done.”
Like 
Keer, 
recent 
Business 
graduate Aishu Chandra didn’t 
think her situation with Carlson 
could be remedied. Taking legal 
action would be too much of a 
process, and fighting with Carlson 
to fix the heat in her roommate’s 
room wasn’t going anywhere: the 
only option, Chandra said, was to 
just deal with it.
“We were just so busy with 
stuff, and I had lived in (horrible) 
places before,” Chandra said. “I 
honestly just didn’t know what our 
rights were; I feel like we just lost 
a lot of energy.”
In an email to the Daily, Carlson 
denied tenants’ allegations of 
carelessness, failing to address 
claims in a timely manner and 
entering 
properties 
without 
notice.
“Since 1976 we have offered 
top-of-the-line 
houses 
and 
apartments for students seeking 
the very best housing on the U 

of M campus,” Carlson wrote. 
“We do not enter the properties 
unless we have been asked to by 
the tenants to fix something or 
we are preparing for an upcoming 
city housing inspection in which 
case the tenants are prior notified. 
For maintenance requests our 
tenants have the option to leave 
a voicemail, send an email or 
submit a maintenance request 
through our website whichever 
is most convenient for them. All 
emergency 
maintenance 
issues 
such as no heat are fixed promptly.”
Gayle Rosen, staff attorney 
of Student Legal Services, said 
she 
commonly 
sees 
attitudes 
like Chandra’s and Keer’s, where 
students — if they even come to 
Student Legal Services at all — 
don’t want to pursue any legal 
action as the process can become 
lengthy and expensive.
“I’m sure there are students 
out there that don’t know we 
exist, or that there is an option 
here,” Rosen said. “One issue that 
I see sometimes that I see with 
students that come to my office, 
they didn’t come here to litigate. 
They don’t often want to resolve 
things through litigation, so that’s 
a big issue too ... There are some 
situations where there is really no 
choice, there are certain situations 
where there is a little bit of a 
choice because the circumstances 
maybe are annoying but not really 
too bad, and they may not want to 
do something.”

Confidence high for Pastujov heading into senior season

Heading into his freshman 
season with the Wolverines, 
Nick Pastujov was tasked with 
more than just preparing himself 
for the transition to college 
hockey. A shoulder injury and 
its ensuing surgery added injury 
rehabilitation to the to-do list for 
the then-freshman forward. And 
in the 28 games he played in his 
first season, Pastujov recorded 
just one goal and two assists.
Now, heading into his senior 
year, 
the 
forward 
has 
had 
three 
consecutive 
summers 
of development –– seeing an 
increase in production every 
season 
with 
the 
Michigan 
hockey team. This summer, he 
attended the New York Islanders’ 
development camp.
The camp’s roster featured 
other college players in their 
program, 
junior-level 
players 
from 
the 
Canadian 
Hockey 
League, recently-signed players 
by New York and various talent 
the Islanders are scouting. For 
the former 2016 seventh-round 
selection by New York, this is 
all part of an offseason that has 
resulted in Pastujov’s confidence 

being as high as ever.
“I definitely think my game 
has matured every single year 
in a different way,” Pastujov 
told the Daily. “And I’m kind of 
starting to find myself and my 
identity and how I want to play 
after college.”
Last season, Pastujov scored 
11 
goals 
and 
collected 
13 
assists. 
Beyond 
the 
numbers 
though, Pasujov’s 
role 
with 
the 
team 
evolved 
as he was often 
slotted alongside 
the team’s leading 
scorer 
— 
then-
junior 
forward 
Will 
Lockwood 
— after then-sophomore forward 
Josh 
Norris’s 
season-ending 
injury in early January.
Norris 
announced 
earlier 
this summer that he will forgo 
his remaining two years of 
eligibility and make the jump to 
the National Hockey League. As 
a result, the duo of Lockwood 
and 
Pastujov 
figure 
to 
be 
spearheading the offense this 
upcoming season.
“Next year a lot of the things 

that I’m going to look forward 
to bringing to the table is more 
or less just controlling the game, 
definitely 
being 
a 
dominant 
force out there,” Pastujov said. 
“I think my specialty is being 
able to center players that can 
definitely produce — guys like 
Will 
(Lockwood). 
Last 
year 
we had a lot of 
success 
because 
I 
think 
my 
specialty is being 
out 
there 
and 
being able to shut 
down a lot of the 
defensive aspects 
of the game and 
get guys like that 
the puck to where 
they can kind of 
go on offense and 
do their thing.”
On top of losing one of their 
most dynamic forwards in Norris, 
the departure of top-assist man, 
sophomore defenseman Quinn 
Hughes, leaves another hole on 
offense — making Pastujov’s 
role as a table-setter even more 
essential for Michigan.
“This year we have a good 
core of our group coming in,” 
Pastujov said. “And I think the 
guys that left are not necessarily 

going to be replaced by a lot of 
the good freshmen, but we have 
a good freshman class coming in.
“I think this last spring term 
and summer, looking forward, 
the guys are working hard … it’s 
a night and day difference just 
the confidence guys have in their 
own game and ability to kind of 
control the puck 
and make plays.”
Last 
year’s 
team fell short of 
expectations for a 
program coming 
off 
a 
Frozen 
Four appearance 
and one that is 
accustomed 
to 
making 
deep 
tournament 
runs. 
They 
bowed out early in the Big Ten 
Tournament and failed to secure 
a spot in the NCAA tournament. 
This offseason, the team has 
addressed that disappointment.
“I think last year the guys that 
were on the Frozen Four team 
that made it two years ago know 
that it’s going to take a lot more 
than what we had going last 
year,” Pastujov said. “… the team 
as a whole has come together and 
realized it was not necessarily a 

fluke but that’s just something 
that can’t happen again. We all 
kind of got together and realized 
we’re going to have to work a 
lot harder to dial it in on this 
upcoming year.”
Pastujov is one of 12 players 
remaining from that Frozen 
Four roster. With less than 
three 
months 
remaining before 
the 
Wolverines’ 
season 
kicks 
off 
with 
an 
exhibition 
game 
against Windsor, 
the 
team’s 
sights are set on 
returning to the 
Frozen Four. If 
there 
was 
any 
extra motivation 
needed to get there, it will be 
hosted pretty close to home for 
Michigan this season.
“I think we have a unique 
opportunity,” 
Pastujov 
said 
“It’s not only my senior year 
but having the Frozen Four 
in Detroit — I think that’s a 
huge motivator for the team 
and everyone. … I don’t see any 
reason why we can’t make it to 
the Frozen Four and take it all 
the way.”

Wetterstrom, Glavinic, Smith aim to replace departed stars

In the cyclical nature of college 
volleyball, good players come and 
go. Coaches recruit their next 
batch of talent, rosters adjust and 
teams move on.
But program cornerstones don’t 
come along nearly as often, and 
even the best teams struggle to fill 
the shoes left by such departures.
For the Michigan volleyball 
team, the close of the 2018 season 
marked the end of outside hitter 
Carly Skjodt and libero Jenna 
Lerg’s storied careers. Skjodt 
finished her tenure with the 
seventh-most kills in program 
history, while Lerg moved into 
second place on the program’s all-
time digs list.
The void left by their production 
won’t be easy to fill, to say the 
least.
Even 
so, 
that’s 
just 
what 
Michigan spent the spring trying 
to do. The graduation of Skjodt 
and Lerg opens up starting spots at 
outside hitter and libero, creating 
healthy competition within the 
program.
That was on full display when 
the Wolverines made their 10th 
trip to the Grand Rapids Sports 
Hall of Fame Showcase, an annual 
spring 
tournament 
featuring 
Michigan, Michigan State, Central 
Michigan and Western Michigan. 

The Wolverines dispatched the 
Chippewas and Broncos in the 
afternoon before taking the court 
against the Spartans.
Last 
November, 
Michigan 
swept the season series with a 
pair of four-set victories against 
its in-state conference foe. In 
their first glimpse of Michigan 
State’s 2019 roster, the Wolverines 
triumphed in five-set fashion in 
front of a full house.
“We went to battle,” said 
Michigan coach Mark Rosen on 
the Rosen Report, his monthly 
video. “It was a great match. I 
thought both teams were very 
evenly-matched … It was a great 
way to finish our spring. Instead 
of playing some fun no-meaning 
match, it was a match that felt like 
a Big Ten match — good opponent, 
good atmosphere, a lot of pressure. 
Our players responded well.”
Rising senior outside hitter 
Sydney Wetterstrom stood out all 
spring long and, fittingly, delivered 
a strong performance against the 
Spartans despite a shaky start.
Wetterstrom missed 11 matches 
in her junior season, but proved to 
be a reliable offensive option when 
available. 
She 
recorded 
eight 
double-digit kill performances and 
posted a .220 attack percentage on 
the right side, earning her first 
double-double 
against 
Rutgers 
and a career-high .883 kill clip 
against Purdue along the way.

“(Wetterstrom) has played a 
lot but her role is different now 
because she’s a senior and the 
expectations are different of what 
she needs to carry,” Rosen said. 
“I thought she advanced so much 
throughout this whole spring. 
A great example was the match 
against Michigan State … She 
struggled in the first set but still 
found ways to impact the match 
in a really positive way with her 
passing and blocking. And then 
as she started getting into the 
match a little bit more, then all 
of a sudden we noticed she was 
making a pretty positive impact 
offensively and by the end she was 
playing great.
“That’s a skill to be able to 
recover that throughout the day. 
A lot of players start hot and keep 
that going or start bad and don’t 
ever recover it, but she was able 
to learn how to recover it. Good 
strides for her.”
This season, Rosen could call 
upon Wetterstrom to make the 
jump to outside hitter. Slotting 
her at the left pin alongside rising 
sophomore 
Paige 
Jones, 
who 
tallied a team-best 38 kills at the 
showcase, would allow rising 
senior Katarina Glavinic to be the 
Wolverines’ 
full-time 
opposite 
hitter.
After starting last season on 
the bench, the 6-foot-3 Croatian 
transfer from Seattle University 

played a key role in Michigan’s 
tournament run. She posted four 
block assists in the tournament’s 
opening 
round 
against 
Navy 
before recording a season-high 
five total blocks in the Wolverines’ 
upset of host Pittsburgh to reach 
the Sweet 16.
This spring, Glavinic picked up 
right where she left off.
“This spring (was) a huge 
development for (Glavinic),” Rosen 
said. “She’s taken her game to a 
whole other level and throughout 
the spring was probably our best 
point-scorer. In the match against 
Michigan State, she proved to be 
that. She started well and finished 
even better, and I thought she did 
a really nice job throughout the 

match. To see players like those 
coming along and developing, 
that’s what spring is all about.”
While 
Glavinic 
and 
Wetterstrom appear poised to 
contribute offensively in Skjodt’s 
absence, rising junior Natalie 
Smith made a strong impression 
at libero. She recorded a team-
high 30 digs at the showcase and 
represented Michigan on the 
Big Ten Volleyball Japan Tour, 
signaling her status as Lerg’s 
successor.
Skjodt 
and 
Lerg 
can’t 
be 
replaced overnight, but seeing 
strong 
springs 
from 
Smith, 
Glavinic 
and 
Wetterstrom 
is 
an encouraging sign for the 
Wolverines.

Former Michigan star Carly Skjodt to join Pepperdine beach team

After a record-setting tenure at 
Michigan, Carly Skjodt is heading 
to the West Coast.
The 
two-time 
All-American 
will take a fifth year with the 
Pepperdine beach volleyball team 
as a graduate transfer.
“We are really excited to be 
Carly’s and her family’s home 
for her last year in the collegiate 
level,” said Waves’ coach Marcio 
Sicoli in a release. “I can’t wait 
to add her skills, personality and 
work ethic to our team culture. 
She will be a fundamental piece 
on the quest to our national 
championship goal.”
Pepperdine, 
which 
finished 
last season ranked sixth in the 
national poll, figures to be in the 
thick of the race for next year’s 

national title. Adding Skjodt is a 
huge boost to an already strong 
crop of returning talent.
For Skjodt, the opportunity to 
spend her fifth year playing on 
sand provides a new challenge 
before wrapping up her volleyball 
career.
“I chose Pepperdine for the 
opportunity to challenge myself 
and grow,” Skjodt said, “in the 
classroom, in the sand and in 
everyday life.”
In 2018, Skjodt put the finishing 
touches on a memorable career 
in Ann Arbor by leading the 
Wolverines to the Sweet 16 for the 
second time. She averaged a team-
high 4.20 kills per set on a career-
best 
.256 
attack 
percentage 
en route to a unanimous first 
team All-Big Ten selection. In 
the classroom, she became the 
program’s first two-time CoSIDA 

Academic All-District honoree.
Skjodt served as Michigan’s 
workhorse for most of the season, 
leading the Wolverines in kills 
in 24 of their 34 matches. She 
recorded 
29 
double-digit 
kill 
performances and eclipsed the 
20-kill mark seven times.
During her high school career, 
Skjodt was ranked among the 
nation’s top prospects in the 
2015 class. PrepVolleyball named 
her the National Senior Player 
of the Year, while she was also 
selected as the Gatorade Indiana 
Player of the Year and USA 
Today All-American after leading 
Carmel High School to a state 
championship.
With her indoor days now in the 
rearview mirror, Skjodt’s name is 
a staple throughout Michigan’s 
all-time record book. Her 1,395 
career kills are good for seventh-

most in program history, while 
her 4,102 attack attempts are 
third-best among any Wolverine.
When 
it 
mattered 
most, 
Skjodt’s presence made all the 
difference for Michigan. Her 108 

postseason kills and seven aces 
are both third-most in program 
history as well.
Skjodt will presumably spend 
most, if not all, of next spring in 
the Waves’ starting lineup.

Franz Wagner signs with Michigan for the upcoming season

Guard Franz Wagner will be 
joining the University of Michigan 
starting 
this 
upcoming 
year. 
The 17-year-old was on a dual-
contract with Alba Berlin and SSV 
lok Bernau Alba this past year, 
deciding between staying overseas 
and coming to play in the NCAA.
In the end, he chose the latter, 
following the footsteps of his older 
brother and former Michigan 
forward Moritz Wagner. 
Wagner announced his decision 
on Saturday via Instagram.
This will be second commitment 
the Michigan basketball team has 
secured since the hiring of head 
coach Juwan Howard. He was 
able to keep wing Cole Bajema — 
who had initially committed while 
John Beilein was head coach — 
which leaves the Wolverines with 
two more scholarship openings for 
the 2019-2020 college basketball 
season. Wagner did make an 
official visit to Michigan the day 
after Beilein’s departure, and 
assistant coach Saddi Washington 

is the only coach still on staff since 
that day.
“We are extremely excited to 
announce Franz has committed 
to join the University of Michigan 
in the fall,” Howard said. “Franz 
gives us another talented guard 
with 
size 
who 
possesses 
a 
wonderful basketball IQ and a 
growing skillset that could be 
impactful for us right away.”
Unlike Bajema who is already 
practicing with the team, Wagner 
will not arrive on campus to 
practice until the fall as he’s 
scheduled to play for Germany 
in the 2019 under-18 European 
Championships in Greece through 
August 4th.
Wagner boasted a high shot 
percentage, making 52.9 percent 
of his shots over 35 games for 
Alba Berlin while shooting 50 
percent from the field in nine 
games for SSV lok Bernau Alba 
last year. He primarily came off 
of the bench, though, starting 
only six games for each team. 
Wagner was awarded 2018-2019 
Basketball Bundesliga Best Young 
Player Award for his efforts in 

the BBL finals, where Alba Berlin 
finished as runner-up.
Many thought that Howard had 
possibly violated an NCAA rule 
as he mentioned Wagner’s name 

on a radio talk show earlier in 
the week. However, sources told 
The Daily that Howard did not 
commit any NCAA violations in 
the process of recruiting Wagner. 

This story is developing and will 
be updated as The Daily learns more 
information. Additional reporting 
was done by Ethan Sears and Jorge 
Cazares.

The standout performers of the 2019 Michigan baseball season

As the baseball team’s 2019 
season comes to a close, and 
Michigan’s magical run through 
the postseason comes to an end, 
the Daily presents these awards 
to members of Team 153 that 
stood out over the course of the 
season.
Most 
Valuable 
Player: 
Jordan Brewer
This 
one 
needs 
little 
explanation. Brewer was the 
backbone of this team all season. 
Offensively, he led the team 
in batting average, at a .329 
clip on the season (even after a 
postseason slump), and slugging, 
with a slugging percentage of 
.557. He stole 25 bases in 29 
attempts, the most on the team, 
and notched 59 RBI, second-
highest of the Wolverines.
Defensively, Brewer had what 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
called 
his 
“explosive” 
raw 
athletic potential on display all 
season, throwing runners out at 
third base from deep right field 
while robbing hits left and right 

on the warning track. He notched 
12 outfield assists on the season.
He 
earned

All 
American 
Honors

and Big Ten Conference Player of 
the Year.
Clutch Genes: Tommy Henry
Henry 
was 
Michigan’s 
projected 
ace 
heading into the 
2019 season and 
performed as such 
during much of 
the first half of 
the 
season, 
but 
nagging 
bicep 
tendonitis 
saw 
him struggle with 
his 
consistency 
down the stretch.
When 
it 
mattered 
most, 
though, 
the 
junior left-hander was practically 
untouchable. 
In Michigan’s win-or-go-home 
contest against No. 1 UCLA in 
Game 3 of the super-regional, a 
flu-ridden Henry pitched seven 
dominant innings, earning the 
win in the victory that sent 

Michigan to the College World 
Series for the first time in 35 
years. 
In his first College World 
Series start, he tossed a 100-
pitch complete-game shutout of 
Florida State in what Florida State 
coaching legend Mike Martin 
described as a “masterpiece.”
And in Game 1 of the College 
World 
Series 
Finals, he tossed 
8.1 
dominant 
innings 
in 
Michigan’s 
only 
victory 
against 
Vanderbilt.
Whether Henry 
can 
hold 
onto 
the 
lights-out 
performance 
he 
demonstrated 
this 
postseason 
remains to be seen. But when the 
Wolverines needed a win, there’s 
a reason they turned to Tommy 
Henry.
Breakout 
Player: 
Jeff 
Criswell
Criswell was solid out of the 
bullpen last year, but he really 
came into his own this season 

when he transitioned to a starting 
role. He finished the season with 
the lowest earned run average of 
Michigan’s three regular starters 
at 2.72 over 17 starts and 106 
innings. 
He and pitching coach Chris 
Fetter spent the entire offseason 
working on the transition back 
to the starting role in which 
Criswell was so effective in high 
school, earning him first-team 
all-region honors from Rawlings 
Perfect Game his senior year 
in 2017. He and Fetter worked 
mainly on smoothing out his 
pitching 
motion 
and 
using 
his legs for more power and 
endurance.
Their hard work paid off in 
spades. Criswell developed his 
fastball to the point that Fetter 
described it as “major league” 
caliber. 
He 
also 
saw 
major 
growth with his two other 
pitches and leaps in his control 
and placement, as was on display 
in his Apr. 13 start at Ohio State, 
the Wolverines’ lone victory over 
the Buckeyes this season.
Criswell was also lights-out 
in relief throughout much of the 

postseason, as Bakich often used 
him in high-leverage situations 
to account for an often-leaky 
bullpen. 
Best 
Single 
Game 
Performance: 
Jimmy 
Kerr 
against Texas Tech on June 21
For three years, Kerr was a non-
starter with the occasional bright 
spot. But he was so productive 
offensively in 2019 that he almost 
took Criswell’s title as Breakout 
Player. But unlike Criswell, Kerr 
found his best success in single-
game bursts. 
Most notable was his four-
for-four day against Texas Tech. 
Kerr was involved in almost 
half of Michigan’s scoring plays, 
helping the Wolverines notch 
seven of their 15 runs that day. 
Kerr himself scored four runs, 
had three RBIs, two home runs, 
a double and a single.
Kerr also gets an honorable 
mention in this category for 
a 
five-for-five 
day 
against 
Michigan State on March 30 in 
which he hit two home runs, two 
doubles and a single, scoring five 
runs on the day in Michigan’s 
16-2 victory over the Spartans.

came into his 
own this season
