Student activists joke it’s the new 

Tinder. With the heavily detailed 
profiles, including pictures taken from 
Facebook, information on their family 
and details about their education, 
Canary Mission provides paragraphs-
long biographies about fellow activists 
— data that simply cannot be found on 
Tinder. But instead of a dating app, it’s 
a site some students and professors feel 
could derail careers and aspirations.

Canary Mission is an anonymous 

blacklist created in April 2015 that 

publishes 
political 
dossiers 
on 

student activists, professors and 
organizations. The website reads, 
“IF YOU’RE RACIST, THE WORLD 
SHOULD 
KNOW,” 
claiming 
to 

document “people and groups that 
promote hatred of the USA, Israel 
and 
Jews 
on 
North 
American 

college campuses.” There are more 
than 2,000 people listed on Canary 
Mission’s website. 

When asked for comment on how 

the website chooses who to place on 
the blacklist, Canary Mission referred 
The Michigan Daily to its ethics policy 
without additional comment.

However, 
the 
site 
has 
been 

criticized for using “McCarthyesque” 
tactics to silence freedom of speech, 
with opponents saying it’s designed to 
deter its subjects from advocating for 
Palestine.

Associate Professor Samer Ali, 

director of the Center for Middle 
East and North African Studies and 
the Islamophobia Working Group, 
researches scapegoating and stigma. 
He called Canary Mission an example 
of both of these. 

“It’s 
a 
complete 
surveillance 

operation,” Ali said. “You’re going 
to feel like you’re being watched, 
targeted. The explicit purpose of 
Canary Mission is to make it difficult 

for people to graduate and find jobs, 
internships or apply for funding 
because any employer who googles 
them, some of what they’ll find are 
these blacklists.” 

While Canary Mission states its 

focus lies calling out student activists, 
it also profiles notorious anti-Semites, 
such as Richard Spencer. Activists 
express 
frustration 
that 
Canary 

Mission groups them with neo-Nazis 
like Spencer. Public Policy junior Arwa 
Gayar is profiled on Canary Mission 
and said the website’s decision to 
group her with staunch anti-Semites 
underscores its problems. 

On Thursday afternoon at 

Rackham 
Graduate 
School, 

Gérard Mourou, 2018 Nobel Prize 
laureate in physics and founder of 
the University of Michigan Center 
for Ultrafast Optical Science, 
discussed his research on laser 
physics. Mourou and fellow Nobel 
Prize laureate Donna Strickland, 
who was unable to attend the 
event, each won a quarter of the 

prize for their work on chirped 
pulse 
amplification. 
Arthur 

Ashkin, 
developer 
of 
optical 

tweezers, will claim the remaining 
half of the prize.

Engineering 
Dean 
Alec 

Gallimore kicked off the event, 
titled “Passion for Extreme Light,” 
by 
acknowledging 
Mourou’s 

accomplishments and work at the 
University. Mourou holds the title 
of professor emeritus in electrical 
engineering and computer science, 
having taught at the University for 

16 years before retiring in 2004.

Gallimore also noted some of 

the innovations that have emerged 
from CUOS, which he said will 
soon be renamed the Gérard 
Mourou Center for Ultrafast 
Optical Science. CUOS is the 
birthplace of IntraLASIK eye 
surgery and houses the world’s 
most intense laser, HERCULES.

“During his time at Michigan, 

he 
founded 
the 
Center 
for 

Ultrafast Optical Science, where 
he served as director for more 

than 14 years,” Gallimore said. 
“Since its beginning, more than 
250 
graduate 
students 
have 

produced roughly 170 patents, 
five startup companies and over 
5,000 scientific publications, the 
safer, bladeless version of LASIK 
eye surgery was developed, and 
HERCULES, the world’s most 
intense laser, was born.”

Thursday afternoon, the Ford 

School of Public Policy hosted a 
policy talk about racial bias and call-
driven policing titled “911, What is 
your prejudice?” The event featured 
panelists who shared their thoughts 
on the topic and answered questions 
from the audience.

David 
Thacher, 
associate 

professor of public policy, hosted 
the panel and asked the panelists to 
spend 10 minutes answering what 
authorities should do when dealing 
with racially-biased calls.

Panelist Jessica Gillooly, Public 

Policy doctoral candidate, began by 
sharing her experiences working 
with the 911 operators’ office in 
Washtenaw County. She told the 
audience the struggle of having 
to discern the legitimacy of a 
suspicious-person call, sharing a 
story of a woman who called the 
police on another woman at the 
park.

“About a year into working as 

a 911 call taker, I took a call on a 
late fall afternoon from a woman 
in a park,” Gillooly said. “She was 
calling on a Black woman who was 
standing near a grill, quote ‘maybe 
cooking drugs.’

Counseling and Psychological 

Services is opening a Wellness 
Zone on North Campus in Pierpont 
Commons, giving students a space 
to decompress from the stress of 
school work. In the wellness zone, 
students will be able to enjoy a 
multitude of activities with the goal 
of self-care.

This will be the only Wellness 

Zone open to undergraduates this 
year, as the original Wellness Zone 
in the Michigan Union has been 
closed for the building’s renovation. 
A 
Wellness 
Zone 
specifically 

for graduate students opened in 
Munger residence hall in November. 

Christine 
Asidao, 
associate 

director of community engagement 
and outreach at CAPS, emphasized 
the importance of the wellness 
zone being extremely accessible to 
students.

“I think one of the messages we 

want to make sure students really 
hear is that self-care and well-being 
is really accessible,” Asidao said. 
“This is a space that they can go 
over there, swipe their card, get into 
the space and be able to just choose 
things that will help them do better.”

On 
Thursday 
afternoon, 

representatives 
from 
the 

recently 
formed 
One 
University 

Campaign met for their second 
coalition 
meeting 
at 
the 

University of Michigan’s Flint 
campus, discussing a number 
of 
resolutions 
regarding 

the future leadership and 
objectives of the campaign. A 
satellite conference was held 
on the University’s Dearborn 
campus, and in Ann Arbor 
at the Lecturers’ Employee 
Organization and Graduate 
Employees 
Organization 

offices.

The 
One 
University 

Campaign, which was founded 
last semester, aims to promote 
equity, specifically in funding 
and opportunities provided 
to 
students, 
between 
the 

University’s campuses. Both 
the lecturers’ and graduate 
students’ unions have taken 
an active role in promoting 
the University’s policies of 

diversity, equity and inclusion 
across the three campuses.

LEO 
President 
Ian 

Robinson, a member of the 
1U 
campaign, 
explained 

promoting 
the 
campaign’s 

goals would serve to increase 
equity of funding and student 
opportunities between Ann 
Arbor, Dearborn and Flint.

“You can make a really 

big difference in Flint and 
Dearborn, in terms of amount 
of money there is available 
per student, with transfers 
from Ann Arbor or from 
Lansing that look pretty small 
by comparison to the overall 
budget we have here in Ann 
Arbor,” Robinson said.

Robinson also emphasized 

negotiations with the Board 
of Regents and administration 
have been difficult — despite 
the 
Ann 
Arbor 
campus’s 

endowment 
and 
revenue 

from tuition, many University 
leaders 
are 
reluctant 
to 

reallocate funds to Dearborn 
or Flint.

LSA sophomore Emma Stein on her story “SMTD event talks sexual 
misconduct in the performing arts”:

“SMTD has had two professors within this academic school year that have been charged 
or convicted of sexual assault. So I think it was really important for the University to do this 
[event]. But the student I interviewed found that they didn’t do a good enough job providing 
actual solutions. They were talking about it, but there was no next step with what they 
were going to do to actually prevent this.”

“What Canary does is it puts 

normal people with staunch anti-
Semites,” Gayar said. “Are you really 
going to compare me — just asking 
for Palestinian human rights to be 
recognized — to a Nazi who hates me 
also? Like, what is happening here? 
That kind of just speaks to the fallacy 
of it.”

LSA 
junior 
Nesma 
Daoud 

conducts research for Ali. Her work, 
which has yet to be published, focuses 
on scapegoating and includes a case 
study investigating those within 
the University system targeted by 
Canary Mission.

“When you google one of these 

people’s names, one of the first links 
that comes up is Canary Mission, 
which basically frames you almost 
as a terrorist,” Daoud said. “To be 
completely 
fair 
and 
completely 

transparent, through my research 
I’ve found they have a lot of alt-right 
people, they have a lot of people that 
are racist. But they are clumping 
together student-activists who are 
strictly anti-Zionist with people who 
are very obviously anti-Semitic.”

Daoud said Canary Mission takes 

social media content and distorts it to 
negatively portray activists.

“They’ll take quotes out of 

context,” Daoud said. “A lot of these 
quotes 
[from 
student 
activists, 

professors and organizations], even 

I would admit, they could have 
phrased them better, especially with 
posting on social media, but they 
were taken out of context in a way 
to paint them in a new, more anti-
Semitic light.”

In the fall of 2016, Lena, a 

recent alum who asked to go by a 
pseudonym to protect her safety and 
privacy, was blacklisted on Canary 
Mission. Lena, who is Palestinian 
American, visited her family in the 
West Bank during the summer of 
2015 and said she was struck by the 
violence she witnessed there.

“To have four soldiers in front 

of me with guns fully loaded, 
questioning my family, interrogating 
us, that was scary, but to my family 
that was normal,” Lena said. “While 
Palestinian people and while my 
family are happy with their lives, 
it just seems like they’re constantly 
battling the occupation and the 
effects of the occupation within 
their lives. That makes me think, 
well, I live in the United States and I 
have a lot of freedom that they don’t 
have.”

After witnessing the challenges 

her family faced, Lena decided to 
become more active in advocating 
for Palestinian rights on campus. 
Lena said she was targeted despite 
being cautious and ensuring her 
name was not publicly associated 
with Palestinian activism.

“It’s like they went out of their 

way to find this stuff and to post 
this stuff and to really target me as a 
student,” Lena said. “I was kind of in 

shock. I couldn’t really believe that I 
was put on it. I was like, ‘Oh, so this 
is what it feels like to be targeted.’” 

Canary 
Mission’s 
ethics 

policy states the blacklist profiles 
anyone who falls under the State 
Department’s definition of anti-
Semitism; disrupts Jewish or pro-
Israel speakers or events; or uses 
language or speech that demonizes 
Jews, Israel or supporters of Israel.

Ali said the effects of being 

placed on Canary Mission remain 
relatively unknown as few studies 
exist on the blacklist, and faculty 
and several students have said the 
blacklist is not widely known or 
highly regarded. 

However, Ali said that does not 

matter. According to Ali, Canary 
Mission’s job is simply to create 
doubt. 

“The only thing that needs to 

happen for Canary Mission to work 
is for an employer to doubt,” Ali said. 
“They’ll go with the candidate with 
less questions to answer. That’s all 
that needs to happen for Canary 
Mission to work. It’s a matter of 
spooking the employer.”

There 
have 
been 
instances 

of 
government 
agencies 
using 

information procured from the 
blacklist. According to Haaretz, 
a 
left-wing 
Israeli 
newspaper, 

the Israeli government has used 
data from Canary Mission to ban 
activists from entering Israel. The 
Intercept reported there have been 
at least two instances of FBI officials 
questioning students about pro-

Palestinian views, referencing 
information 
from 
Canary 

Mission. 

Daoud said the University 

appears to be targeted more 
than other universities, due 
to the presence of active 
Social Justice for Palestine 
organizations, according to the 
research she has completed 
thus far. She estimates just 
below 70 people associated 
with the University are listed 
on Canary Mission. 

“What I’ve noticed in my 

research is that there are a 
couple of universities that you 
could call hotspots, where 
there’s more student activism,” 
Daoud said. “So the University 
of Houston, Tufts (University), 
George Washington University, 
the University of Michigan, 
even 
Stanford. 
Those 

universities have more active 
SJPs.”

Ali 
also 
attributed 
this 

over-representation in part to 
the University’s most recent 
divestment campaign, when 
CSG 
voted 
in 
November 

2017 to create a committee 
to investigate divesting from 

University assets that activists say 
harm Palestinians, such as Boeing 
and Hewlett-Packard. While the 
proposal passed CSG, the University 
Board of Regents rejected the 
measure in December 2017. 

“Here on campus, in particular, 

University of Michigan students 
and faculty have been singled out 
because the University is one of a 
very few number of universities 
where student government has 
passed 
resolutions 
asking 
the 

University to divest,” Ali said.

Before CSG representatives voted 

on the resolution at hand, they had 
to decide if the upcoming vote would 
be secret — representatives’ votes 
on CSG resolutions are typically 
public information. Those in favor 
of the secret ballot noted the risk of 
being put on blacklists like Canary 
Mission. 

However, following the vote, 

some representatives who voted for 
the secret ballot discovered they 
had been placed on the blacklist, 
according to student sources. 

LSA junior Reem Al-Khatib was 

placed on Canary Mission three 
months into her freshman year at 
the University after appearing in 
a pro-Palestine video where she 
stated 
her 
Palestinian 
identity 

and her support for #UMDivest, a 
proposal to divest University assets 
from certain companies that “are 
involved in human rights violations 
against 
the 
Palestinian 
people 

according to international law.”

“I’m a Palestinian freshman,” 

Al-Khatib said in the video. “I 
support #UMDivest, because as a 
Palestinian living in the diaspora, it 
is my duty to stand up for those who 
cannot speak for themselves.”

According 
to 
Al-Khatib 
and 

another person featured in the video, 
despite the fact that a dozen people 
appeared in the video, some speaking 
for longer than Al-Khatib, she was 
the only one who was blacklisted 
initially (many of those who spoke 
in the video were blacklisted later for 
other pro-Palestine work). 

Several students said the blacklist 

targets Palestinians first, although 
it claims to target anyone who 
promotes hate of Israel or Jews, 
including Jewish activists. 

“I 
was 
pretty 
irrelevant,” 

Al-Khatib said. “I wasn’t doing 
anything crazy on campus. The 
most crazy thing I did was doing 
that video, and because I said I was 
Palestinian, I was the only one that 
got targeted from that video.”

Nadine Jawad, a recent alum 

and 
former 
vice 
president 
of 

Central 
Student 
Government, 

said that Palestinian voices are 
often disfranchised, which adds 
importance to the role of an ally. 

CANARY

See CANARY, Page 3


“I think it’s a really important 

point to note that, oftentimes, 
Palestinians are so silenced in this 
narrative that it’s up to allies to 
support this struggle for justice and 
freedom of speech,” Jawad said. 
“But that isn’t to say they don’t have 
agency. Palestinian people definitely 
speak for themselves, they’ve been 
advocating for themselves, for self-
sufficiency for decades. I’m not 
saying they don’t have the agency 
or clout to do so, what I’m saying 
though is that in U.S. institutions 
specifically, 
Palestinian 
voices 

are often wiped out and not given 
equal weight in conversation, or 
they’re oftentimes just ignored 
purposefully, 
intentionally, 
for 

political reasons.” 

Al-Khatib said the function of the 

blacklist is especially detrimental 
since many of those targeted have 
parents who immigrated to the U.S. 
in order for their children to receive 
a better education and increased 
opportunity. 

“Education is really important 

to us because, in my case, the 
reason my parents came is so that 
I could get a better education and I 
could thrive with the resources in 
America, following the American 
Dream,” Al-Khatib said. “Canary 
Mission threatens that for us. I 
think that’s a very real fear that 
first-generation Americans have. 
It’s the most important thing for us 
to achieve our education. So a lot of 
people are immediately turned off. 
They’re like, ‘It’s better to stay quiet, 
not make a sound, make it through 

my education,’ because we don’t 
have the privilege of being able to 
express our political opinions 
without having any consequences 
that affect not only us, but our 
families.”

The blacklist does not exempt 

Jewish activists from its ranks. 
Jewish Voice for Peace, a group 
that “seeks an end to the Israeli 
occupation of the West Bank, Gaza 
Strip and East Jerusalem,” appears 
on Canary Mission. Mondoweiss, 
a foreign policy blog founded 
by a former New York Observer 
columnist who is Jewish, also 
appears on the blacklist, along with 
a number of individual Jewish 
activists. 

LSA senior Ali Rosenblatt was a 

representative on CSG during the 
divestment campaign. Although 
Rosenblatt, who is Jewish, did 
not support the resolution nor the 
secret ballot, she condemns Canary 
Mission and said it stifles dialogue. 

Rosenblatt said her peers who 

were opposed to divestment were 
also against the blacklist. She 
stressed the two opinions should 
not be conflated with each other. 

“It’s a cyber-bullying website,” 

Rosenblatt said. “It chills dialogue 
on campus. Because of the website, 
I’ve had more trouble having 
conversations with people on the 
other side of this issue. People 
are scared to talk to me because 
I’m Jewish, and what I’ve heard 
is because I’m Jewish, some 
wrongfully presume I must support 
it and I must be contributing to the 
website, which is so not the case. 
It’s unfortunate that this happens. I 
don’t blame people for being afraid, 
but that’s why I oppose it. It instills 

fear, and I don’t agree with that.”

While the list of representatives 

who voted for the secret ballot 
is shown in a video online, many 
activists 
said 
Canary 
Mission 

draws on material not readily 
available online, or material that 
may be private. Jawad said it was 
unknown how Canary Mission 
finds this information. 

“Nobody knows — that’s up 

for speculation,” Jawad said. “If 
you look on Canary Mission’s 
website, it takes submissions, so 
the submissions must come from 
students or people that are watching 
the live streams. I wouldn’t venture 
to say that it is other U of M students 
— I don’t think that it is. I think it 
could be anybody. You never know 
who’s on the internet looking at 
you, and everything is public and 
live-streamed so it could literally be 
anybody.” 

Rosenblatt agreed and said she 

would be surprised if students 
contributed tips to the blacklist. 

“I 
think 
what’s 
a 

misunderstanding on this campus 
is that some people think that it’s 
a Michigan issue, so they think 
it must be Michigan students 
contributing to it,” Rosenblatt 
said. “This is a national issue, it’s 
a national website. I wouldn’t be 
surprised if nobody on campus 
contributes to it. As far as the 
(secret ballot) votes go, because The 
Daily live streams it, pretty much 
anybody on campus or off campus 
could find out who voted, and the 
CSG records are public.”

Al-Khatib does believe certain 

individuals at the University may 
contribute to Canary Mission. 
However, she noted Hillel, an 

opponent of #UMDivest movement, 
has spoken out against the blacklist. 

“There’s definitely an inside 

source,” Al-Khatib said. “They 
know things that are super, super 
specific to our campus that no 
one stalking you on Facebook 
could know. They definitely get 
tipped off. Like for example, when 
divestment came out, in 2017 last 
year, we turned it in for readings 
just for CSG to approve, and a lot 
of that information got leaked 
and was put on Canary before it 
became public about co-authors 
and stuff like that. And that was 
private information. Only CSG and 
us could look at it, so it makes you 
wonder how is this information 
getting leaked and who’s letting 
it. And I know the opposition for 
divestment was Hillel, Hillel was 
leading the campaign, but they’ve 
spoken out about it and reached out 
to us about it, so I’m not saying it’s 
them. I think it’s individuals on this 
campus that are trying to degrade 
our cause. And they know how to 
target us.”

Current Hillel chair Leor Rosen, 

LSA junior, wrote in an email she 
disapproved of Canary Mission and 
its methods.

“Many 
students 
at 
Hillel, 

including myself, strongly oppose 
the intimidation tactics of Canary 
Mission and have spoken out 
against it in the past,” Rosen wrote. 
“The website prevents constructive 
dialogue and is counterproductive 
to efforts to oppose BDS. I want 
our campus to be a space where 
students can engage in productive 
discourse without fear of being 
targeted.” 

Zoha Khalili is a staff attorney 

for Palestine Legal, an advocacy 
group that provides legal service 
and 
advice 
for 
pro-Palestine 

activists. The group has also been 
targeted 
by 
Canary 
Mission. 

Khalili said Palestine Legal has 
not filed any lawsuits against 
Canary Mission and she knows of 
no other law firms who have taken 
legal action against the blacklist’s 
website 
either. 
Khalili 
said 

defamation lawsuits are difficult to 
win because of the courts’ strong 
defense of freedom of speech.

“Generally we are reviewing 

their profiles for inaccuracies,” 
Khalili said. “Canary Mission often 
will put out vague statements that 
make it harder for people to take 
action against them when you’re 
defaming them. Defamation is 
when you’re putting out false 
information about someone and 
that causes them harm, which is 
something that Canary Mission 
engages in routinely. But because 
our system of government is 
focused more on creating the 
broadest area possible for free 
speech, it is a bit hard to litigate 
defamation cases.”

However, Khalili said Palestine 

Legal did offer students advice on 
when it is appropriate to report 
Canary Mission’s social media 
account. 
In 
October, 
Canary 

Mission’s Twitter account was, in 
fact, deactivated for two weeks for 
violating the website’s terms of use. 
It was later reinstated following 
appeals from supporters of the 
blacklist.

“Right now they’re the 

kind of people who came up 
with, and are now defending, 
the policies that come in the 
way of equity,” Robinson 
said. “The current view in 
Ann Arbor is that each of our 
three campuses should have 
watertight 
compartments 

across the three campuses so 
that resources can’t really be 
transferred back and forth.”

During 
the 
coalition 

meeting Thursday, attendees 
began to set out a coalition 
platform, 
delineating 

the objectives of the 1U 

campaign. In crafting this 
platform, 
attendees 
voted 

on whether or not to include 
measures such as equalizing 
faculty 
funding 
across 

campuses, expanding the Go 
Blue Guarantee to Dearborn 
and Flint, and allocating 
funds to scholarships and 
study abroad programs.

Tyrice Denson, director 

of 
foreign 
outreach 
for 

Student Government at U-M 
Flint, began the meeting by 
describing recent actions 1U 
had taken to gather support 
among the staff and student 
body for the coalition’s goals.

“We went and presented to 

Central Student Government 
to outline the platform to 
them,” Denson said. “The 

feedback I got from that was 
overwhelmingly positive. I 
think that a lot of people in 
CSG are supportive of the 
idea of breaking down those 
barriers and having more 
equitable resources.”

The 
central 
discussion 

point 
Thursday 
was 
the 

creation of a general 1U 
steering committee, which 
would 
be 
tasked 
with 

overseeing the day-to-day 
work of the organization.

According to the proposal 

announced 
during 
the 

meeting, these tasks would 
include 
establishing 
all 

campaign-related 
agendas, 

finding speakers for public 
action; engaging the media 
and elected officials and 

creating communications. 

Attendees at the meeting 

decided 
members 
would 

self-nominate for positions 
on the steering committee, 
and 
ideally 
represent 
a 

wide range of University 
perspectives, 
including 

undergraduates, 
graduates 

and lecturers as well as 
tenured 
and 
untenured 

professors.

LSA 
junior 
Sharif-

Ahmed Krabti was one of 
the 1U members who self-
nominated for a position on 
the newly established board. 
Ultimately, 
four 
members 

volunteered 
for 
positions 

from 
Flint, 
one 
from 

Dearborn and three from 
Ann Arbor.

As a member of the new 1U 

leadership structure, Krabti 
explained he was optimistic 
about the foundation the 
steering committee would 
provide for the future of the 
organization.

“I’m 
feeling 
really 

confident about the decisions 
we made,” Krabti said. “I’m 
glad that we are putting forth 
a steering committee and a 
platform, pending approval. 
Those are all really tangible 
first steps. I feel really 
good about the coalition’s 
structure, it has a big focus 
on equity and inclusivity 
within 
the 
conversation 

and 
the 
decision-making 

process.”

“When I asked her why she 

thought the woman was cooking 
drugs, she responded ‘I saw her here 
before and she looked suspicious and 
this time she looks more suspicious.’ 
That was her only justification for 
her call to the police.”

Gillooly shared the call with 

dispatch, and was scolded by 
her supervisor for putting in a 
“ridiculous call.” She shared there 
are protocols in place for dealing with 
biased phone calls, emphasizing how 
further conversation can determine 
the legitimacy of the calls.

Washtenaw 
County 
Sheriff 

Jerry Clayton, another panelist, 
discussed how dispatch deals with 
the calls from operators. He said 
police officers will sometimes go 
to the scene without engaging 
with the suspicious person. When 
they do interact, Clayton said he 
understands why people are irritated 
when they must deal with the police. 
He is working with fellow officers to 
set up an action plan to respond to 
suspicious-person calls.

“Metro dispatch will manage the 

suspected bias-influenced calls in a 
manner that minimizes the impact 
on the subject of the call,” Clayton 
said. “In extreme cases, they will 
not dispatch police personnel … for 
service that are clearly the result of 
a caller bias.” 

Clayton said there would possibly 

be two outcomes for the call. One 
outcome would involve either not 
showing up to the scene at all or 
responding to the call and having 
a conversation with the person in 
question. The other outcome would 
be figuring out what skills police 
officers need to possess to behave 
the way the sheriff’s office wants.

Panelist Barry Friedman, law 

professor at New York University, is 
working on the Policing Project at the 
New York University School of Law, 
an organization that partners with 
communities and police to create 
preventative measures for police 
accountability. He took his time to 
“widen the lens” from discussing 
how 911 operators deal with racially 
biased calls, as well as how the 
Sheriff’s Office deals with these 
calls. He said incarceration, police 
stops, pre-trial release decisions and 
other dealings with authorities are 
impacted by racial bias as well.

“You can’t talk about mass 

incarceration 
without 
policing,” 

Friedman said. “Most of the folks 
who end up in the criminal justice 
system end up there through the 
door that is opened up by the police. 
We have to look at this whole iceberg, 
I think to kind of get a handle on it.”

He questioned if police are the 

best responders since what most 
of the situations need is mediation 
rather than force. He then asked his 
audience to ask a three-fold question 
of “What are the police doing here?”

“Just because police are the 

first responders, which they are, 
doesn’t mean that they are the right 
responders,” Friedman said. “And 
the question I want people to ask is 
going to sound like one question but 
actually is three. The first question 
is, ‘What are the police doing here, 
which is to say, are the police the 
right people to be responding to 
deal with this particular situation?’ 
The second question is, ‘What are 
the police doing here — when they 
respond, what is it that they actually 
do and what are they trained to 
do?’ And finally and probably most 
importantly, ‘What are the police 
doing here — is there something 
about this place that is problematic 
from a social perspective that we 
need to deal with in some way other 
than the police?”

Thacher opened up the room to 

anonymous questions. One person 
asked how to motivate officers and 
dispatchers when they are so short-
staffed. Friedman answered the 
short-staffing of police officers is 
not so much an issue as the short-
staffing of professionals who deal 
with public health and social issues.

“Many of the things that fall 

into the lap of the police that we 
think of as policing problems of this 
country really are public health 
problems,” Friedman said. “You 
need a mentality in the public to 
treat them as that and fund them as 
that and for some reason it’s easy to 
get funding for cops relative to a lot 
of other things.”

Rackham students Jarell Skinner-

Roy and Laura Lee Smith came to 
the talk to learn more about what 
authorities are doing concerning 
biased calls. Roy believed this was 
a good step for sharing information 
with the public.

Among 
the 
principal 

objectives of the wellness zone 
is to help students conquer 
Seasonal Affective Disorder, a 
type of depression caused by 
the decrease of sunlight in the 
wintertime. To conquer SAD, 
CAPS is installing two light 
therapy machines so students 
can get their daily dose of 
vitamin D.

“Seasonal Affective Disorder 

is a big thing, we live in the 
Midwest and don’t get to see a 
lot of sun so it does affect our 
mood, and so we will have two 

light therapy machines available 
as well,” Asidao said. “That can 
be a really great boost when you 
do 30 minutes a day for at least 
a week; they will start to feel 
better.”

LSA freshman Natalie McKee, 

a resident on North Campus, 
described how the lack of sun 
during Michigan winters can be 
difficult to adjust to for students 
from out of state. 

“It’s not really sunny up here 

because of the high latitude,” 
McKee said. “I’m from Colorado, 
and it’s a lot sunnier there. It was 
definitely an adjustment for the 
weeks of cloudy days. It would 
be nice to have the (vitamin D) 
lamps when it’s not sunny for 

such a long period of time.”

Other 
additions 
to 
the 

wellness 
zone 
will 
include 

meditation studios and yoga 
mats.

CAPS Director Todd Sevig 

explained the inspiration for the 
new Wellness Zone derives from 
the success of the opening of the 
first wellness zone on Central 
Campus in 2011.

“In 2011 we opened our first 

Wellness 
Zone,” 
Sevig 
said. 

“Long story short, it resonated 
really 
well 
with 
students. 

Starting the second year, our 
estimate is about 5,000 students 
used the wellness zone every 
year. 
They 
(students) 
wrote 

comments to us (CAPS) on a 

whiteboard and it was just really 
supportive.”

A 
large 
reason 
for 
the 

success of the Central Campus 
wellness zone is the amount 
of student engagement in the 
decision-making process during 
its inception. CAPS hopes to 
replicate this method to ensure 
the Pierpont Commons wellness 
zone fits the needs of students.

“Nothing happens on this 

campus of substantive value 
or 
lasting 
change 
without 

the involvement of everyone 
working together,” Sevig said. 
“Students in terms of the ideas, 
both past and current, and also 
the administrators, the Pierpont 
staff, to make the physical space 

happen.”

Engineering freshman Naomi 

Kantor expressed excitement 
for the wellness zone coming to 
North Campus as a way to wind 
down during the semester.

“I know for a lot of people 

you don’t live on North Campus, 
and as an Engineering student 
you spend a lot of time on 
North Campus,” Kantor said. 
“If you have breaks between 
classes it would be good to 
have somewhere to decompress 
because you don’t have the 
luxury to go back to your house.”

According 
to 
CAPS, 
the 

grand opening of the Pierpont 
Commons wellness zone is set 
for March 18.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

As an editorial board, 

we express our solidarity 
with 
victims 
of 
clerical 

abuse 
and 
urge 
serious 

ramifications and judicial 
impositions on members of 
the Catholic Church on both 
local and national levels, so 
as to encourage true change 
within the institution.

Pope 
Francis 
will 

soon 
issue 
a 
document 

motu proprio — a rescript 
initiated and issued by the 
pope of his own accord 
and apart from the advice 
of others, as defined by 
Merriam Webster — which 
shows his commitment to 
offering 
some 
concrete 

proposals. But how realistic 
is it to believe that the same 
institution that sponsored 
this abuse will now root 
it out? Defrocking priests 
who 
engage 
in 
sexual 

abuse 
should 
have 
been 

a consistent policy of the 
Catholic Church. Instead, 
we know that the opposite 
occurred.

In 
the 
United 
States, 

the 
2002 
Boston 
Globe 

investigation 
of 
clergy 

sex abuse in the Roman 
Catholic 
Archdiocese 
of 

Boston 
revealed 
a 
vast 

network 
of 
cover-ups 

and 
institutionalized 

sexual abuse. The face of 
public 
relations 
for 
the 

Catholic Church following 
that 
scandal, 
Theodore 

McCarrick, 
was 
recently 

defrocked from his position 
as a U.S. Cardinal after he 
was found to have solicited 
sex during confession and 
sexually abused both minors 
and adults. About one-third 
of living U.S. bishops have 
been accused of ignoring 
cases of sexual misconduct 
in 
their 
dioceses, 
while 

at 
least 
15 
bishops 
are 

themselves 
accused 
of 

committing sexual abuse.

Sexual 
abuse 
by 
the 

Catholic 
Church 
is 
a 

public safety threat to U.S. 
citizens, 
and 
since 
the 

Church has proved unable 
to police itself, it is now the 

turn of legislators to step in 
and protect the American 
people. American Catholics 
represent 
over 
one-fifth 

of the population, and our 
governing bodies need to 
do a better job of defending 
the rights of victims as well 
as taking a stronger role in 
prosecuting those involved.

Instead 
of 
providing 

a 
clear 
and 
actionable 

response 
plan 
to 
abuse 

within the church, Pope 
Francis has only offered 
“reflection 
points” 
to 

drive 
the 
conversation 

surrounding 
the 
issue. 

Since the Catholic Church 
has shown an inability to 
police itself, we at The 
Daily believe that tangible 
policy changes, as well as 
some cooperation between 
the Catholic Church and 
state governments, are the 
only path forward to help 
protect 
Americans 
from 

what should be described as 
a serious danger to Catholic 
Americans.

The issue of clerical sex 

abuse is a deeply ingrained 
problem within the Church 
and has no simple solution. 
It is difficult to overcome 
the immense wrongs of the 
Catholic 
Church 
without 

taking its vast power and 
institutional 
influence 

into 
consideration, 
while 

still acknowledging its role 
in religious and cultural 
practice. As an Editorial 
Board, 
we 
recognize 

these 
factors 
and 
again 

emphasize the importance 
of changes in policy and 
judicial relations between 
the state and Church in 
order to protect Catholic 
Americans. 
Through 
this 

acknowledgement, 
we 

propose several amendments 
that 
can 
be 
utilized 
to 

make the Church a safer 
institution.

Almost as deplorable as 

the abuse itself is the web 
of cover-ups among church 
officials, and encouraging 
reporting to outside entities 
is a way for victims to have 

an objective, legal voice. 
Allotting social workers or 
representatives to serve as 
a resource for members of 
the Church can ensure that 
victims 
are 
being 
heard 

and represented to the full 
extent of the law, while 
simultaneously 
holding 

abusers 
accountable 
for 

their crimes. Furthermore, 
in the hopes of increasing 
reporting, we urge the U.S. 
government to get involved 
legislatively 
by 
extending 

the statutes of limitations 
for these crimes. Reporting 
crimes 
— 
especially 
sex 

abuse — is a trying process, 
and allowing victims more 
time to process their trauma 
and choose a course of action 
will give more victims the 
ability 
to 
report, 
while 

re-emphasizing the fact that 
abusers of any era need to 
face 
severe 
ramifications. 

We also implore Michigan 
Attorney 
General 
Dana 

Nessel to increase judicial 
action in regards to clerical 
abuse. This is already a 
part of her platform, and 
we encourage it to be taken 
seriously 
and 
extended 

across the country.

The 
Catholic 
Church’s 

lack of willingness to self-
regulate in the aftermath of 
these crimes is indicative 
of a threat to the safety of 
Catholic Americans across 
the nation, and symbolic 
condemnations 
are 
not 

enough to overcome this 
long-standing problem. The 
absence of tangible policy 
change is inexcusable and 
underscores 
the 
Church’s 

position as an institution 
that cares little about the 
victims it has left in its path. 
The number of allegations 
and scandals has reached a 
point where we can no longer 
expect them to hold their 
own 
leaders 
accountable, 

and we therefore must urge 
our own policymakers and 
attorney generals to enforce 
greater action to protect 
the public from clerical sex 
abuse.

DYLAN BERGER | COLUMN

The catastrophic failure of socialism in Venezuela
W

hile 
it’s 
nearly 

impossible 
to 

imagine 
now, 

Venezuela 
was 
one 
of 
the 

wealthiest nations in the world 
until the 1990s. With a healthy 
democracy 
and 
burgeoning 

middle class, Venezuela was 
poised to remain prosperous for 
generations to come. Following 
the rise of socialism in Venezuela, 
however, that all changed. The 
people of Venezuela are now 
forced to endure unimaginable 
suffering due to a socioeconomic 
collapse brought about by failed 
socialist policies. Shockingly, 
the type of big government that 
has caused so much needless 
suffering in Venezuela is now 
popular in the United States. 
We must learn from Venezuela 
and reject socialist policies that 
breed human misery.

When 
I 
use 
the 
word 

socialism, I mean the wholesale 
government takeover of the 
economy. 
That 
is, 
out-of-

control government spending, 
socialized 
medicine, 
price 

controls and the like. I feel the 
need to define socialism because 
the word means a lot of different 
things to different people. In our 
discourse today, there is much 
disagreement over who or what 
qualifies as socialist and for that 
reason, I think it is necessary to 
define the term. 

Before the onset of socialism, 

Venezuela was a true economic 
powerhouse. In the 1960s and 
1970s, the country produced 
10 percent of the world’s crude 
oil and maintained a GDP per 
capita approaching that of the 
United States. At the same 
time, Venezuela could boast 
a 
democratic 
government. 

Elections occurred at regular 
five-year intervals and were 
contested peacefully by political 
parties committed to democracy 
and sensible economics. While 
the country persisted for some 
time after, the seeds of the 
inevitable decline of this thriving 
socioeconomic 
system 
were 

sown with the nationalization of 
the Venezuelan oil industry.

Former 
Venezuelan 

President Carlos Andrés Pérez 
argued that more government 
control over the oil industry 
would benefit the people instead 
of greedy industrialists. In 1976, 
he created a state oil monopoly 
called Petróleos de Venezuela 
(PDVSA) and banned foreign 
companies from the Venezuelan 
oil market. When a global oil 
glut hit the industry in the mid-
1980s, the Venezuelan state 
proved unable to cope with the 
market change. Within 10 years 
of nationalization, Venezuelan 
oil production fell by roughly 50 
percent to less than two million 
barrels a day.

Instead 
of 
embracing 

market reforms, the people 

of Venezuela turned to even 
more 
extreme 
government 

intervention to turn around the 
economy. In 1998, Venezuela 
elected self-proclaimed Marxist 
Hugo 
Chávez 
as 
president 

of Venezuela. After he was 
elected in a landslide, Chávez 
promised cheering supporters, 
“Venezuela’s 
resurrection 
is 

underway 
and 
nothing 
and 

nobody can stop it.” 

Unfortunately, the socialist 

policies 
implemented 
by 

Chávez 
proved 
devastating 

to Venezuela’s economy and 
society. 
Chávez 
instituted 

aggressive 
policies 
to 

redistribute wealth from select 
industries and individuals to his 
working-class constituency. For 
example, Chávez nationalized 
the Banco de Venezuela, or Bank 
of Venezuela, and the nation’s 
largest 
telecommunications 

company, 
CANTV. 
To 
cope 

with rising inflation resulting 
from nationalization, Chávez 
implemented price controls on 
a wide array of basic necessities.

By the time Nicolás Maduro 

was elected president following 
Chávez’s 2013 death, Venezuela’s 
economy was in full free-fall. By 
over-inserting the government 
into the economy, Venezuela’s 
socialist leaders have brought 
about the disintegration of the 
country’s economy and society. 
Venezuela has been brought to 
its knees by poverty, corruption 
and hunger.

The Venezuelan economy 

has halved in size over the past 
five years and inflation has 
reached above 2 million percent 
annually. The Venezuelan people 
are 
enduring 
unimaginable 

suffering as a result of this 
crisis. Due to food shortages, 
the average Venezuelan lost 
24 pounds in body weight 
during 2017 alone. With an 85 
percent shortage of medicine, 
Venezuela’s entire healthcare 
system is at risk of total 
collapse. More than 3 million 
Venezuelans 
have 
fled 
the 

country, desperately searching 
for a better life.

Venezuelans are no longer 

willing to sit idly by while their 
great country is ravaged by man-
made disaster. Being faced with 
resounding defeat at the ballot 
box, Maduro jailed potential 
opponents 
and 
threatened 

others in the run up to the May 
2018 election. Following this 
fraudulent 
election, 
Maduro 

is using state security services 
to hang onto power in spite of 
his people’s wishes. Make no 
mistake, Maduro has morphed 
into a full-blown dictator willing 
to watch his people suffer so he 
can hang onto political power. 
The world must support the 
Venezuelan people in their quest 
to liberate themselves from 
the scourge of despotism. I’m 

confident that the Venezuelans 
will 
emerge 
victorious 
in 

their quest for the restoration 
of prosperity and individual 
liberty.

While 
the 
Venezuelans 

struggle to free themselves 
from a socialist system, an 
increasing number of Americans 
are fighting for one here. In 
fact, a 2018 Gallup poll found 
that 57 percent of Democrats 
view 
socialism 
positively 

while 45 percent of those aged 
18 to 29 favor socialism over 
capitalism. 
Illustrating 
this 

trend 
of 
increased 
support 

for 
socialism, 
leading 
2020 

presidential contender Bernie 
Sanders openly identifies as a 
“Democratic Socialist.” Sanders 
has pledged to “... create an 
economy that works for all, not 
just the very wealthy.” While 
we all can support an economy 
that works for everyone, the 
socialist 
policies 
creeping 

into the mainstream of our 
society would do anything but. 
Replacing human innovation 
with a big government proves 
destructive to any society. 

A 
plethora 
of 
such 

destructive socialist policies is 
currently finding burgeoning 
support among the American 
electorate. For example, U.S. 
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 
D-N.Y., 
has 
introduced 
the 

Green New Deal. This initiative 
would rob the American people 
of consumer choice, raise taxes 
and lead to countless job losses. 
As further evidence of this 
trend, a significant number of 
2020 Democratic presidential 
contenders such as Sen. Kamala 
Harris, 
D-Calif., 
and 
Sen. 

Elizabeth 
Warren, 
D-Mass., 

have come out in support of the 
elimination of private health 
insurance in favor of government 
control. 

Unfortunately, 
the 

Venezuelans know this kind 
of state takeover all too well. 
Campaigning under the guise 
of equality, socialist leaders 
there robbed the country of 
its prosperity and democracy 
while 
enriching 
themselves. 

Socialism 
is 
destructive 

wherever 
it’s 
implemented 

due to its desire to repress 
individual liberty in favor of 
absolute power for the state. 
However, the human spirit 
always triumphs. There’s no 
socialist system strong enough 
to quash our innate desire to 
be free from the constraints of 
absolute government control. 
The American people must 
reject socialism so that we never 
face the same terrible plight as 
our Venezuelan neighbors.

FROM THE DAILY

Calling for action on the Catholic Church
O

n 
Sunday, 
Pope 
Francis 
concluded 
an 

unprecedented global summit addressing the 
widespread issue of clerical sex abuse in the 

Catholic Church. The Church has been at the center 
of a massive scandal involving sexual misconduct, 
implicating members of the Church from local priests 
to the highest-ranking cardinals. It has also become 
clear that clerical sex abuse was something of an 
open secret among members of the clergy, creating 
a culture of cover-ups and protection of offending 
priests. Though Pope Francis delivered strong words 
against perpetrators of abuse in his closing remarks, 
declaring an “all-out battle”against sexual predators, 
many were left unsatisfied by what seemed to be a 
speech devoid of tangible solutions.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

DISNEY CHANNEL

They were doing “High School 
Musical,” of all things. Of course 
I would come back to support 
my sister and my old theatre 
department, but “High School 
Musical?” The movie is iconic and 
an essential part of my childhood. 
The stage musical is an awkward 
embarrassment to theatre and 
Troy Bolton himself. So the 
fact that it was the show I was 
returning to my worst nightmare 
to see somehow made an already 
unfortunate occasion worse.
I have done theatre pretty much 
all my life, to the point where it 
pretty much is my life (yes, I’m 
one of those kids). I love theatre, 
it’s my passion. But my experience 
with high school theatre often 
made me forget that love and lose 
my passion. Throughout my four 
years of high school, I had a lot of 
damaging experiences that really 
impacted me, even to this day. All 
those memories came flooding 
back as I filed into the alumni row 
of the auditorium I knew so well.
Since leaving my high school 
theatre behind, a lot has changed 
in my life. I was a lead in a summer 
show at a respected community 
theatre, I started school at the 
University, I made great friends 
and new memories. Not only had 
my life changed, but I changed. 
I was no longer that little high 
school girl who was damaged 
by disloyal friends and hateful 
directors. So why did I still feel 
so small being put back in that 
environment?
The problem was, I didn’t feel 
like I had overcome my past yet. 
My demons from high school 
were still haunting me. I had 

applied to the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance but hadn’t heard 
back yet; I hadn’t been able to do 
a show. I didn’t feel like I was any 
more successful in theatre than 
when I was shoved into chorus 
parts and berated by directors. 
I still heard the taunts ringing 
in my ear. I still felt like I wasn’t 
good enough.

Luckily enough, I did end up 
where I wanted to be. At the time 
I went back, I had no idea all the 
good things in store. I didn’t 
know that two days after seeing 
the show, I would get cast in my 
first college show. I didn’t know 
that four days after seeing the 
show, I would be accepted into 
the School of Music, Theatre 
& Dance Bachelor of Theatre 
Arts program. I didn’t have that 
knowledge of success shielding 

me from the insecurities I felt 
when I was back where success 
seemed impossible.
The thing is, sometimes you 
have to face your demons without 
knowledge 
of 
your 
current 
successes shielding you from 
your past failures. I had to find 
that strength in myself, not what 
I had accomplished or how far I’d 
gotten since leaving high school 
behind. Instead of allowing not 
only my high school experience 
to be ruined, but also my post-
high school experience. I tried to 
remember the little things that 
made me happy there and all 
the happy emotions I felt being 
back. I still loved theatre. I still 
was immensely proud of all my 
kids up onstage. I still hugged 
my sister and congratulated my 
friends. Of course, I avoided my 
old director like the plague and 
practically sprinted to the other 
side of the lobby when I saw my 
ex-best-friend — that pain isn’t 
leaving anytime soon. But I didn’t 
let that stop me from enjoying the 
— albeit questionable show — and 
I certainly didn’t let it haunt me 
when I returned to school Sunday 
afternoon.
Sitting in the alumni row of my 
old high school auditorium, seeing 
my past up on the stage in front of 
me, I realized that I will never be 
able to forget my experiences in 
that theatre program. Maybe I 
hadn’t completely overcome my 
past. Maybe I wasn’t necessarily 
where I wanted to be. Maybe I 
would never get to either of those 
points. But I could take comfort 
in knowing how far I’ve come, 
and that I’ll never be back where 
I was again. I found the strength 
in myself to face my demons, and 
they were a lot less scary when 
they looked like Troy Bolton.

Facing your demons, who
look a lot like Troy Bolton

Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen’s “The Exonerated” is dedicated to 
“the exonerated” and “those who are still waiting.” The piece follows 
six wrongfully convicted prisoners from the time of their arrest 
until the time of their release. This past weekend, it was presented 
in the Arthur Miller Theater by the Department of Musical Theatre 
under the direction of Geoff Packard, LSA Lecturer of Drama.
Rather than following one story through to its conclusion, the 
work constantly fluctuates between different stories. The play 
starts soon after each prisoner’s arrest for a crime they did not 
commit. Though the audience may not see the connections between 
each prisoner at first, 
the police’s conduct 
soon 
makes 
this 
connection 
clear; 
in every instance, 
some mix of racism, 
police 
bias 
and 
faulty prosecutorial 
practices 
lead 
the 
inmates 
to 
be 
wrongfully 
convicted.
From 
the 
beginning, the play 
was held together 
by the simple beauty 
of 
its 
production. 
The set was simple: 
three 
black 
boxes 
organized in steps 
and 
twelve 
black, 
armless desk chairs. 
The 
lighting 
was 
similarly elegant and 
minimal: purple lights highlighting the concrete wall in the back 
of theater, frequent blackouts and spotlights accompanying the 
changes in scene.
Between scenes, the cast would hum and wordlessly sing brief 
melodic passages, accompanied by simple recordings of a guitar 
at some points and a piano at others. While melodically and 
harmonically simple, these brief interludes did much to punctuate 

the otherwise heavy subject matter.
As the School of Music, Theatre & Dance had advised, the 
production contained multiple instances of strong language. In 
one instance in particular, a prisoner’s false arrest and conviction 
is accompanied by clear racial bias 
on the part of the police — they are 
depicted using the n-word casually 
and repeatedly to refer to this prisoner. 
While this callous use of the n-word 
was perhaps realistic, it was hard to 
palette.
This set the tone for the next half 
hour of the play, as it moved between 
various failures of the criminal justice 
system. One 
prisoner was 
convicted on 
questionable 
forensic 
evidence, 
another 
on 
the 
false 
testimony of 
a murderer 
who 
immediately 
reached 
a 
plea 
deal 
with the police. And in every instance, 
these prisoners’ lives were torn apart as 
they were convicted of a crime that they 
did not commit.
From there, the play focused on their 
collective experiences in prison, some 
more pleasant than others. The play also 
began to focus on the death penalty and 
the morality of the prisoners being put 
on death row. “Why do we do that?” one 
prisoner asked.
In one particularly jarring instance, as a prisoner on stage spoke 
about execution by electric chair, the lights over the audience 
flashed bright white three times. All around me, audience members 
muttered in fright and surprise — lighting designer Emily Miu more 
than succeeded in shocking her audience, assuming this was her 
goal.

As the play moved past these false convictions and lengthy 
imprisonments, however, it began to lose steam. The exoneration 
prior to execution of every prisoner (save one prisoner’s husband), 
for example, felt a little unrealistic. Up until this point, the play 
had 
succeeded 
in 
its 
suspension 
of 
disbelief. 
But 
the 
sudden change from 
extremely dark subject 
matter 
to 
inspiring 
legal 
challenges 
made me question the 
plot, particularly the 
selection of these six 
specific cases and the 
degree to which they 
are representative of 
the larger American 
criminal 
justice 
system.

The 
play’s 

depiction of women, 
furthermore, 
was 
lacking. Most of the 
women were wives of 
wrongfully convicted 
prisoners; throughout 
the play, they existed 
on stage solely through the wrongful convictions of their husbands.
The play featured one female prisoner, a woman convicted of 
murder and sentenced to death row along with her husband. Though 
she made it out of prison, her husband was executed. And in the end, 
she framed the remainder of her life largely through her husband’s 
wrongful execution and the time that she had lost with him. The 
women in the play lacked autonomy — a feature of the mid-20th-
century setting of the play that nevertheless felt like a slight moral 
failing.
On the whole, the play was a poignant reminder of the pressure 
that many police forces feel to arrest a suspect for violent crimes, 
and thus the frequent wrongful convictions that permeate the 
criminal justice system. It was a dark, serious narrative that was 
troubling and hard to watch at times. And yet I left convinced of the 
failures of our criminal justice system and committed to working 
to fix this problem. It was something that I will not soon forget – 
something that I will no doubt be thinking about for a long time.

‘The Exonerated’ exposes injustices of justice system

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

Between scenes, the cast would hum 
and wordlessly sing brief melodic 
passages, accompanied by simple 
recordings of a guitar at some points 
and a piano at others

In one particularly jarring instance, 
as a prisoner on stage spoke about 
execution by electric chair, the lights 
over the audience flashed bright white 
three times

The opening track on the 
new Lily & Madeleine record, 
Canterbury Girls, is called “Self 
Care” — a reference, surely, to 
the lately revitalized cultural 
priority 
of 
self 
care. 
But 
Indiana 
sisters 
Lily 
and 
Madeleine 
Jurkiewicz 
are a package 
deal, and even 
a song that 
nominally 
seems 
to 
look 
inward 
ultimately 
functions as 
a 
dialogue 
between 
them. 
The 
lines 
from 
the 
chorus 
— “I’m sure 
you 
don’t 
understand 
/ 
Who 
the 
hell I think 
I am / Your 
beautiful 
eyes are sad 
and 
scared 
/ But I can’t 
make myself care” — hint at a 
relationship of tough love and 
honest conversation, making 
it a strong characterization of 
what is to come from the rest of 
the album.
Canterbury 
Girls 
marks 
the fifth full-length album 
for Lily & Madeleine, who 
first attracted listeners with 
the melodic, complementary 
synchrony 
of 
their 
voices 
and 
harmonies 
featured 
in 
homemade 
high 
school 
YouTube videos. Their ouevre 
is one marked by a careful 
consistency, primarily working 
in the realm of folk pop and 
constantly making use of the 
natural ways in which their 
soft vocals join one another and 
intertwine.
This 
newest 
addition 
is 
named after Canterbury Park 

in Indianapolis, where the 
sisters would sometimes go to 
play while growing up. While 
the sisters have relocated to 
New York City, it’s clear from 
their sound that they still hold 
the roots of their music very 
close 
to 
heart. 
Canterbury 
Girls finds them continuing to 

make use of their trademark 
hypnotic harmonies, while also 
diving deeper into the pop-
informed atmosphere that has 
distinguished Keep It Together 
and some of their other recent 
releases. 
Nowhere 
do 
they 
abandon the sounds of the 
Midwest entirely, but they do 
explore more geographically 
on tracks like “Pachinko Song,” 
which tracks Lily on a journey 
through Tokyo: “I ran through 
Tokyo hoping to find the place 
/ Where only I could be, but 
I never found it / But I never 
found it.”
“Soaked 
in 
sunshine, 
don’t know where to be,” the 
Jurkiewicz sisters sing on the 
titular 
track, 
“Canterbury 
Girls.” Yet the album itself, as 
a whole, feels like it exists in a 
somewhat more liminal space 

— hinted at by the album cover, 
which depicts the two of them, 
inclined toward each other and 
toward us, standing in front 
of a vast lake under a haze 
of purplish clouds. Purples, 
oranges and yellows converge 
on this cover in the visages of 
Lily and Madeleine, evoking 
a 
soft 
space 
that 
could 
be 
either a sunrise 
or 
a 
sunset, 
depending 
on 
your 

interpretation.
In a musical 
sense, 
the 
explorations 
and 
preoccupations 
of 
the 
album 
do 
indeed 
maneuver 
around 
the 
edges 
of 
a 
liminal 
softness. Songs 
like 
“Bruises,” 
“Circles” 
and 
“Analog 
Love” dip into 
a 
reflective 
and 
at 
times 
melancholy 
sensibility. 
On 
the other hand, 
“Supernatural 
Sadness,” 
“Pachinko Song” and “Can’t 
Help the Way I Feel” are all 
somewhat jauntier melodies 
that feel like they’ve drawn 
inspiration from the fringe pop 
hits of earlier ages.
Canterbury 
Girls 
delves 
into melancholy, love, sadness 
and sisterhood. It’s a trim 
ten songs, some of which are 
more pop-inspired and seem 
to beckon reawakening and 
rejuvenation, while others feel 
more like dreamy incantations 
or even sore laments. Lily and 
Madeleine sound as magical 
together as ever, and even 
though they haven’t forged 
paths into remarkably new 
territory, they do continue to 
deliver quality songs that strike 
a fine balance between peace 
and despair, beauty and pain, 
harmony and solitude.

It’s Friday!!!

The 
annual 
Probility 
Marathon returns to Ann 
Arbor on March 24th, and 
organizers are hoping for 
a large turnout. The race’s 
first event, held in 2012, 
attracted runners 
from 44 different 
states and raised 
thousands 
for 
nonprofits 
and 
Ann Arbor Public 
Schools. This year, 
Packard 
Health, 
Cancer 
Support 
Community, Ele’s 
Place and North 
Star 
Reach 
will 
be receiving the 
profits from the 
marathon, 
with 
attendees 
given 
the 
chance 
to 
donate more upon 
registration. 
The 
race 
program 
is 
run 
by 
Epic 
Races, which has 
raised a total of $205,000 for 
charities since 2015, all while 
providing the opportunity for 
new and experienced runners 
alike to join the local events.
This year’s course begins 
at Michigan Stadium and 
passes 
through 
the 
Hill 
neighborhood, 
around 
the 
Forest Hill Cemetery, through 
Gallup Park and the Arb (and 
the feared hill which runs 
through it) before finishing 
back at Michigan Stadium. 
Runners can choose to run 
a 5K, 10K or full marathon. 
The race had also deviated 
from the standard marathon 
policy in proudly overseeing 
a zero waste policy and a 
standardized results system, 

a move which has helped 
to attract the thousands of 
attendees in previous years. 
Hotel 
information, 
route 
maps, registration and race 
results can all be found on 
the 
Epic 
Races 
website, 
linked here.
Epic Races is also adding a 
new event this year: the relay. 
Runners have been invited 
to split the distance of the 

full marathon among teams 
of two-four. That harrowing 
26.2 has been smashed into 
the far more approachable 
numbers of 6.05 and 7.05 (two 
legs of each). And you know, 
when you can run three miles 
you can run four, and when 
you can run four you can 
grossly round up to seven. 
And then, suddenly, you’re 
piecing together a marathon 
team from the largest group 
of 
people 
you 
see 
most 
frequently: Daily Arts.
Although 
Arts 
has 
a 
reputation for not, like, doing 
anything except talk about 
highbrow music and movies, 
running is in our brand. 
Haruki Murakami has run 

one marathon a year from 
the age of 33, and completed 
all 62 miles of the Hokkaido 
ultramarathon 
in 
1996. 
Will Ferrell has three full 
marathons under his belt, and 
P. Diddy finished the New 
York in 2003 “in sunglasses, 
his hair in a closely cropped 
Mohawk and an ‘I Heart New 
York’ breathing strip across 
his nose.”
If P. Diddy can 
do 26.2, we can do 
seven. 
Welcome 
the 
Daily 
Arts 
Runners: 
Emma 
Chang, 
John 
Decker, 
Shima 
Sadaghiyani 
and 
Verity Sturm. As 
a unit, we boast 
a 
spectrum 
of 
relationships with 
running, 
ranging 
from 
“cross 
country in middle 
school” to “5ks on 
treadmills” 
and 
“half 
marathon 
into 
Canada.” 
And to be honest, 
we 
haven’t 
been 
training (have you 
seen the ice?). But hey, the 
internet says we can get the 
deed done in four, three, even 
two weeks. So stop asking me 
about it.
All irony aside, there’s 
something 
alluring 
about 
passing 
the 
baton 
across 
that historic distance across 
the city in which we seem 
to weather a marathon of 
experiences day in and day 
out (and with our coworkers, 
to boot). Register here if you 
want to run alongside us and 
rip on “Green Book,” stay 
tuned for our training video 
dropping the week of 3/18 or

I’ve been thinking a lot 
about mothers lately. Last 
week was a whirlwind of 
sadness and celebration, as 
the sudden death of one of 
my good friends’s mother fell 
within days of my own mom’s 
birthday. I cried, I laughed, I 
talked to my mom for hours 
on the phone. It’s times like 
this that remind me how 
much she means to me, how 
much a mother can mean 
in general. During this era 
of pseudo-adulthood I find 
myself in at college, I realize 
more and more every day how 
much she has prepared me 
for whatever life might throw 
in my way. Sure, it might not 
be easy to get through, but if 
there’s anything I’ve taken 
to heart from her, it’s that 
I’ll get through eventually. I 
love her more than any other 
person ever to walk this earth 
here are some things that I 
have learned from her that I 
think about every single day. 
Thanks, mom.
There 
is 
beauty 
in 
literally everything around 
you.
My friends would vouch 
that I have taken this to heart, 
that I’m one sappy girl when it 
comes to anything beautiful. I 
cry at everything: sad things, 
happy 
things, 
beautiful 
things, funny things. I think 
the key to really capturing 
happiness in your life is to 
understand this fact. It’s not 
something my mom has ever 
said verbatim to me, but I’ve 
learned from watching her 
that there is a kernel of joy 
hidden 
inside 
everything 
we see on the day to day. 
When it snows and looks like 
powdered sugar falling in the 
night here, I think of my mom 
 
she has literally yelled at my 
siblings and I to “LOOK AT 
BEAUTY!” on a regular basis 
for most of my life. Sunsets, 
flowers, fields on the way 
to our cottage up north, it’s 
all beautiful to her. Through 

this, she taught me how to 
find that kernel of beauty 
even in the darker times we 
all go through: There’s always 
something waiting to surprise 
you.
Tell the people you love 
that you love them.
This one is pretty obvious 
to me, but I realize now how 
important it truly is. I tell my 
friends I love them constantly, 
almost 
to 
an 
annoying 
extent. That’s something I’ve 
learned from my mother. In 
her opinion, if you feel it, 
why wouldn’t you share that 
with someone? Knowing the 
amount of love in my life, all 
I can do is share it with those 
around me. It’s three words, 
a short declaration that can 
make all the difference to 
whoever it’s said to. The fear 
of awkwardness or rejection is 
much less daunting when you 
understand that an immediate 
response doesn’t really matter 
in the long run instead, it’s the 
thought behind it that stays 
with those involved.
Don’t be afraid to say 
what you feel.
If there’s anything that 
this week taught me, it’s that 
things can change quicker 
than you think is humanly 
possible. That’s something my 
mom has always embraced, 
telling my siblings and I 
everything she feels for us at 
any given moment. She calls us 
“chickens,” which I’ve always 
found hilarious. Sometimes 
I’ll be sitting at home and hear 
her through the wall: “I’m so 

glad you’re home, chickens!” 
It’s kind of a drastic example, 
but those expressions of love 
and happiness have rubbed 
off on me. What’s the use of 
keeping something great or 
important inside your head? 
Everything’s 
better 
when 
people are on the same page. 
Don’t hide from yourself by 
hiding your thoughts from 
those who are lucky enough to 
hear them. It doesn’t need to 
be dire, maybe just a reminder 
that you care, or that you saw 
something funny on the way 
to work. If something makes 
you happy or sad or possesses 
you to share it at all, you 
never know how much it can 
brighten another person’s day.
The best skill a person 
can have is the ability to 
laugh at life.
My mother is one of the 
funniest 
people 
I 
know, 
and it’s not just because she 
has a wicked wit she really 
knows how to laugh at life, 
whether it’s good, bad, or even 
somewhere in between. At its 
base elements, life is hilarious. 
Understanding that can make 
any moment full of dread or 
sadness just that little bit 
better so it’s easier to handle. 
I have a considerably darker 
sense of humor than she does, 
but I think a lot of it came from 
this lesson that she has taught 
me. It’s a lot less difficult to 
get through hard times when 
you can find the humor in 
your situation, or even in 
yourself. In my opinion, this is 
the most important thing I’ve 
learned from my mom. Being 
a person in this crazy world 
is hard, you might as well be 
able to see how ridiculous it 
is. We’re all just here trying 
to have a good life, but the 
thing that binds us is how 
insane the path may seem to 
get there. Laugh a little more, 
and I promise it will make 
that journey a smoother one. 
It might even rub off on your 
own children one day.

DAILY GENDER & MEDIA COLUMN

CLARA 
SCOTT

For my mom, with love

About 
a 
year 
before 
the 
publication of his first novel, 
“Bangkok 
Wakes 
To 
Rain,” 
Pitchaya Sudbanthad published 
a listicle cataloging a handful of 
“place-based novels.” He writes: 
“When writers get asked how their 
novel came to them, some might 
answer that a character spoke first 
or a sentence sounded to them, 
and for others, like me, we require 
an arrival of a place, or rather, our 
arrival to one.”
“Bangkok” seems to be an 
attempt to stage such an arrival for 
the reader. The novel’s nearly 
400 pages aim to capture the 
titular city in a panorama 
from 19th-century Siam to a 
speculative future of climate 
catastrophe. His approach to 
this dizzying task is like that 
of a collage — Sudbanthad 
writes that he “(let) my mind 
wander in the city where I was 
born and (heard) the city tell 
me stories,” and accordingly, 
“Bangkok” takes the form of 
a collection of stories in and 
around Bangkok. As a possible 
anchor point, we get a recurrent 
Garcia 
Márquez-esque 
house 
somewhere in the city, which most 
of the characters are connected to 
in some way.
Despite this confluence of the 
vast and the specific, Sudbanthad 
generally leaves allegory just out 
of view. His characters do not 
necessarily symbolize anything, 
even if they are representative of 
certain kinds of citizens of the city 
at different times and places. The 
central characters of the story are 
Sammy, who moved away from the 
city when he was young, and later 
returns to sell his parents’ house; 
Nee and Nok, two sisters who grow 
up in Bangkok together before 
Nok leaves for Japan and Nee gets 
involved in the student protests 
of the ’70s; and Mai and Pig, two 
millennials who are around for 
the city’s reclamation by the sea in 
the 2020s. The novel intersperses 
episodes of the main characters 
with one-off anecdotes and wide 
panoramic shots, all intended, 
presumably, to capture another 
aspect of the city — to make the 
image more complete. There’s even 
a section told from the point of 
view of the birds in the marshy area 
surrounding the city.

This is all a lot to take in, and 
despite the elaborate schemes 
Sudbanthad uses to connect the 
disparate threads of the novel, it 
still feels like we are essentially 
dealing 
with 
a 
collection 
of 
unrelated stories. This is fine, but it 
would help if the stories themselves 
had more interest beyond simply 
commenting on each other. The 
individual story arcs have the 
quality of fading in and out without 
accomplishing much: Sammy drifts 
from place to place, Nee and Nok 
argue and eventually make up, 
Pig and Mai drift apart. The plots 
frequently have a backdrop of social 
unrest, but after 1976, nothing 
disastrous really happens, or indeed 

feels like it can happen. Even when 
the rising seas completely swallow 
the old city, we are reassured that 
there’s life after it, and that it’s just 
as boring as before: Mai and Pig live 
suspiciously like Nee and Nok did.
More 
generally, 
what’s 
so 
striking about the idea of a “place-
based novel” is that it is essentially 
founded on a contradiction. If the 
point of a novel (of the kind with 
speaking and thinking characters) 
is a sense of location, of place, the 
characters are mostly important 
for their ability to illuminate the 
place, even as we see them on the 
page as thinking, speaking humans 
rather than symbols.
Accordingly, 
Sudbanthad’s 
characters feel like the novel’s 
weakest link. In Sammy’s case, 
one could be forgiven for being 
unenthusiastic about the Global 
South edition of the Salingerite 
anti-hero, who wanders around 
stewing in his disaffection with 
nearly everything. He is passive-
aggressive toward his family, he 
treats women badly, he feels a guilt 
far vaguer than seems situationally 
appropriate — it’s familiar and a 
little ugly.
Nee and Nok are the novel’s most 
successful characters, but they 
seem a little plain, slotted into roles 

and tasked with playing them out. 
The two sisters are both defined by 
their memories. In Nee’s case, she 
relives her traumatic experiences 
in the student protests as similar 
events happen in 1992, but is 
otherwise mostly just dutiful to 
her job as a manager for the condo 
building and swim instructor. Nok 
starts a Thai restaurant in Japan, 
a balm for the homesickness of 
Thai students. Nee and Nok are 
conduits for memory, which is, for 
Sudbanthad, a force like gravity: 
unidirectional, 
rather 
linear, 
inescapable.
And there are some characters 
who are somewhere in between 
having full roles and just sort 
of being representative of 
a time or a place. A 19th 
century minister gets some 
of Sudbanthad’s best prose, 
but his role in the story is 
never clarified; he just seems 
to be there to inform us that 
Bangkok had a past. The 
strangest of his characters 
(and despite this, definitely 
one of the book’s larger 
catastrophes) is Clyde, the 
jazz pianist copy-pasted from 
New York to Bangkok in the 
mid to late 20th century. Clyde 
feels like the muzak version of a 
jazz musician written by someone 
who engages with the history of 
American popular music out of the 
corner of his eye — there’s no real 
history or engagement with any 
of the musical movements Clyde 
would have known of or lived 
through, an omission that feels 
profoundly wrong in a genre of 
music so heavily focused on lineage 
and influence. (Later in the novel 
Sudbanthad makes up a series of 
absurd jazz musicians that makes 
me think he hasn’t ventured very 
far into the back catalog.)
Clyde also gets some of the 
novel’s 
most 
puckered, 
florid 
writing: “When he had much of the 
crowd swaying and nodding their 
heads at the table, he knew the 
irrepressible moment had arrived. 
He’d call them out to the floor and 
out they’d tumble, tugged from 
their seats by a hand they might 
only hold for that night. Folks sure 
went wild, given the permission 
of a mess.” It’s impossible to know 
what Sudbanthad wants his readers 
to get from this strange man. He is 
just there, much like everything 
else in this novel is just there, left 
for the reader to draw any possible 
conclusions from it.

Wolverines focused on regular 
season finale against Wisconsin

Prior to this season, senior 
guard Nicole Munger and senior 
center Hallie Thome pondered 
expectations for what was to 
come.
“Nicole said at the end of the 
summer, ‘Coach, I think we 
have an opportunity to be Big 
Ten champs next year,’ ” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “And her and Hallie 
debated that and wavered that 
and went back and forth on 
that and they came to common 
ground that that’s gonna be 
our message for our team this 
season, and that’s gonna be our 
goal for our team this season. 
And they’ve kind of stuck with 
that.”
The Big Ten Tournament 
tips off in less than a week, but 
for now, the Michigan women’s 
basketball team (10-7 Big Ten, 
19-10 overall) is putting those 
aspirations on standby. The 
final regular-season matchup 
— Sunday afternoon against 
Wisconsin 
(4-13, 
13-16) 
— 
garners more attention.
“My focus is on Wisconsin,” 
Barnes Arico said. “We have a 
Big Ten tournament? When’s 
that?”
Though 
she 
was 
clearly 
joking, there’s truth underlying 
Barnes Arico’s comment.
The two teams will meet for 
their second time this season. 
The Wolverines won the first 
outing, 76-70, in Madison at the 
start of the month. They’ll look 
to replicate that result at Crisler 
this weekend.
Michigan 
started 
out 
slowly in that game, but solid 
performances 
by 
freshman 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon 
and 
freshman 
guard 
Amy 
Dilk 
helped the team prevail. Hillmon 
led the team with 20 points and 
eight rebounds, shooting 8-of-

9 from the field. Dilk helped 
generate much of that scoring, 
finishing with eight assists.
The 
roommates 
could 
potentially lead the team again. 
Hillmon has been top-notch 
recently. Since the previous 
meeting, she has averaged 16.3 
points a night. In the past two 
games against Michigan State 
and Rutgers, she dropped 27 and 
21 points, respectively.
“Naz 
has 
just 
been 
tremendous,” Barnes Arico said 
on Inside Michigan Basketball 
Radio Show. “And every now and 
again, she’ll have a freshman-
like moment, but it doesn’t really 
last for too long. She’s just been a 
special player.”
Dilk suffered a right knee 
injury 
against 
Nebraska 
— 
immediately after facing the 
Badgers. She sat out the next 
three games before playing 16 
minutes against the Scarlet 
Knights. And she tallied 29 
minutes last Sunday against the 
Spartans.
“I think she’s getting close 
to 100 percent and we’re gonna 
need her down this tail stretch 
here,” Barnes Arico said.
The Wolverines are coming 
off a loss at Michigan State 
that 
snapped 
their 
seven-
game win streak. Turnovers 

and fouls contributed to their 
downfall. Michigan lost the ball 
25 times and gave the Spartans 
27 free throw attempts — of 
which they made 23. With no 
midweek contest this week, the 
Wolverines have had time to 
fine-tune.
“We haven’t had a bye week 
all season,” Barnes Arico said 
on Tuesday. “So it’s great for us 
to work on things that Michigan 
needs to get better at and some 
of the things that we haven’t 
been successful at in the next 
couple days.”
Forwards Marsha Howard 
and 
Imani 
Lewis 
are 
Wisconsin’s top scorers, both 
averaging double digits. That 
said, the Badgers have struggled 
throughout the season with just 
two road wins. They’ve lost 
four of six since last playing 
Michigan and sit at second-to-
last in the conference standings.
The Wolverines appear to be 
the clear favorite and should 
soon be able to take on their 
bigger desires.
“It’s just another opportunity 
for our team to go out there and 
show what we’ve been working 
on and how great we can be,” 
Munger said. “ … One more game 
and then we can focus on (the 
Big Ten Tournament).”

Freshmen to play key role

Per man, as Mel Pearson 
likes to think, Wisconsin is the 
most talented team in the Big 
Ten.
The 
Michigan 
hockey 
coach points to the Badgers’ 
speed 
and 
skating 
ability 
when explaining why they’re 
so dangerous. But with their 
talent, it begs the question 
as to why they are sitting one 
point from the bottom of the 
conference.
“They’re 
very 
young,” 
Pearson said. “And they’re 
starting to mature. They’ve 
been in most games. They’ve 
had a couple recently that have 
gotten away from them, but 
they’re a scary team.”
One notable characteristic 
Wisconsin shares with the 
Wolverines 
is 
youth. 
The 
Badgers roster nine freshmen 
and seven sophomores, many of 
whom are major contributors 
to 
the 
team. 
Michigan, 
similarly, has 10 freshmen and 
six sophomores.
In the previous series in 
November, it was Wisconsin’s 
freshmen 
who 
made 
the 
difference, scoring all three of 
its goals in the series. Despite 
the impact, their inexperience 
showed as well, committing 
late-game 
penalties 
that 
jeopardized the result of the 
match.
This 
weekend, 
Pearson 
expects an entirely different 
team — for both sides.
“I think we’ve grown a 
lot,” Pearson said. “I think 
we matured a lot since then, 
and the freshmen have grown 
a lot as you can see by Nolan 
Moyle’s 
play, 
Garrett 
Van 
Wyhe, and Nick Blankenburg 
and Jack Summers, and you go 
down the list, those guys have 
really taken steps.
“And I think Wisconsin too, 
some of their freshmen are 
no longer freshmen. They’re 
playing like upperclassmen.”

The growth in Michigan’s 
freshmen has been evident. 
Even as of last weekend, Moyle 
broke out for three goals against 
Ohio State, scoring back-to-
back goals to win Friday’s 
game 
for 
the 
Wolverines. 
Van Wyhe connected with 
Moyle for both of those goals, 
highlighting 
the 
chemistry 
the two built on throughout 
the season. Blankenburg broke 
open the scoring for Michigan 
on Saturday, and Summers 
stepped up to the plate after 
Luke Martin went down.
The upcoming weekend will 
be the final regular season 
series for both teams. Having 
come off a nail-biting series 
split against the Buckeyes, 
Michigan 
failed 
to 
secure 
home ice for the Big Ten 
Tournament. 
Instead, 
the 
Wolverines will need three 
points out of the series against 
the Badgers to get home ice.
“Well, 
I 
thought 
(last) 
weekend was intense when we 

played Ohio State,” Pearson 
said. “And I think it’s going to 
go up another level because of 
the implications. I mean, they 
still have a chance for home 
ice and we’re battling for that. 
So 
everyone’s 
still, 
there’s 
still something on the line for 
everybody.”
The 
Wolverines 
haven’t 
seen too many high-stakes 
situations in the season, but 
Pearson believes that the team 
can rise to the occasion.
“It can put pressure on you, 
but it can also excite you,” 
Pearson said. “And I hope it 
does the latter, I hope the guys 
are excited about that. We’ve 
been pretty good on the road 
this year. We’ve yet to be swept 
on the road, we’ve found a way 
to win and get points, every 
weekend we’ve played this 
year, and I expect the same out 
of this group. I know they’ll be 
ready to play, they’re anxious 
to get back at Yost, but we just 
need to play Friday’s game.”

Catch a wave: Baseball looks to 
capitalize on trip to California

While the students of the 
University of Michigan head off 
to rest their weary brains during 
Spring Break, the No. 17 Michigan 
baseball team (6-0) is going to 
work in sunny California.
“That sounds like baseball 
heaven to me,” said head coach 
Erik Bakich. “Eight games in ten 
days, we are fired up for that.”
On this trip, the Wolverines 
will face four teams currently 
with a winning record in addition 
to a talented Southern California 
team looking to prove itself.
Michigan kicks off its Spring 
Break on Friday with a three-
game series against Cal State-
Northridge 
(5-4), 
which 
is 
coming off a 4-3 loss to No. 3 
UCLA — a game in which they 
gave up a one-run lead in the 
seventh 
inning. 
Looking 
to 
avenge the loss, the Matadors 
will be eager to take down a 
ranked Michigan team trying to 
extend its unbeaten run as long 

as possible.
After Cal State-Northridge, 
the Wolverines will enjoy a 
day off before playing Long 
Beach State and University of 
California-Irvine 
on 
back-to-
back days where the real test 
starts for its pitchers. Star juniors 
left-hander Tommy Henry and 
right-hander Karl Kauffmann 
will have to keep the heat on after 
just four days of rest.
The Dirtbags, currently 0-7, 
will try to improve on a poor start 
to the season, but they will be 
coming off one day of rest from 
their series at Ole Miss.
The 
Anteaters, 
conversely, 
will be coming off of five days of 
rest and eager to play their first 
ranked team of the season.
What Michigan is looking 
forward to most comes on the 
final weekend of Spring Break, 
when it will be playing against 
No. 19 Oklahoma State inside of 
Dodgers Stadium.
“I’m 
really 
excited 
about 
the Dodgertown classic and to 
get the opportunity to play in 
Dodgers Stadium,” said Bakich. 

“Just hearing from the guys that 
are on the team in 2017, it was one 
of those life memories that you 
make, getting to play in Dodgers 
Stadium. So I’m excited for the 
kids that they get to experience 
that 
and 
play 
in 
Dodgers 
Stadium.”
Over the three-game stretch 
the Wolverines will play the 
Bruins and Trojans at their home 
fields before the finale against 
the 
Cowboys. 
The 
toughest 
stretch of games for Michigan 
in the early season, these three 
matchups will prove how good 
the undefeated Wolverines really 
are before they come back to play 
in Ann Arbor for the first time all 
season.
Bakich, though, is not looking 
past the early week matchups.
“Everyone that we play out 
on the West Coast are perennial 
powers, 
from 
Cal 
State-
Northridge to Long Beach to 
Irvine to UCLA, USC, Oklahoma 
State,” Bakich said. “From that 
standpoint we’re going to be 
really tested in those eight games 
over the 10-day period.”

Michigan trying to overcome 
struggles with mental game

Michigan 
softball 
is 
unranked. It hasn’t defeated 
a ranked team, it’s yet to 
dominate an entire tournament 
and it’s lost more games than 
it’s won.
The Wolverines have hit a 
total of two runs in four games 
against ranked opponents and 
scored three runs or fewer in 
over half of their games.
Last weekend, Michigan left 
the LSU Invitational in Baton 
Rouge, LA with three losses 
in five games, and it wasn’t 
happy. The team let up seven 
runs in one contest against 
an unranked Stanford team, 
complicating 
the 
pitching 
staff’s 
previously 
perceived 
reliability.
The Wolverines left the third 
week of the season as coach 
Carol Hutchins’ first losing 
team this far into a season in 
35 years. After a start like that, 
how could they be happy?
Michigan is in uncharted 

territory, and it’s time to own 
up to it.
After 
weeks 
of 
“mental 
lapses,” 
“lack 
of 
focus” 
and other mental problems 
plaguing the Wolverines — as 
players have said — it’s worth 
looking at why the team can’t 
seem to click mentally. If the 
problem really lies in lack of 
focus, then why can’t Michigan 
get on its game? When they do, 
they blow by teams, play tough 
against 
ranked 
opponents 
and perform well offensively 
and 
defensively 
against 
difficult schedules. So why 
is mental acuity so hard for 
the Wolverines to find, and 
how will they live up to the 
potential we’ve seen in bits and 
pieces of games?
Players 
weren’t 
made 
available this week to answer 
those questions.
We’ve seen the chemistry in 
short stints. Michigan trounced 
South 
Florida 
and 
Illinois 
State in the USF Opening 
Weekend Invitational, held No. 
9 Louisiana State to a close 1-2 

loss last weekend and carries 
over much of the talent from 
last year in its upperclassmen. 
We know how the Wolverines 
are capable of playing, and 
they know it too, as players 
have said several times. But 
something isn’t clicking with 
the softball team, and we’ve 
seen it so far this season.
Last weekend, sophomore 
left-hander Meghan Beaubien 
said 
she 
didn’t 
have 
the 
right mindset or clear head 
to throw well, and that she 
corrected that mindset for 
her no-hitter in the California 
State-Northridge 
game. 
Beaubien threw one of her 
best games of the season that 
day. But the problem lies in 
the fact that she, and many of 
her teammates, can’t emulate 
those 
performances 
every 
game.
We all know that Michigan 
softball hasn’t had the start it 
wants, and we all know that 
something is wrong, so now it’s 
up to the Wolverines to let us 
know why.

Position review: Special teams

With the Michigan football 
team’s 2018 regular season in 
the books, The Daily looks back 
at the performance of each unit 
this year and peers ahead to the 
future in 2019. In this edition: 
special teams.
Michigan’s 
special 
teams 
unit came into the year a largely 
raw bunch that had seen its ups 
and downs the year before. 
But from the time sophomore 
defensive back Ambry Thomas 
returned a kickoff 99 yards 
for a touchdown in the season 
opener against Notre Dame, 
it 
also 
flashed 
its 
unique 
potential.
The 
group’s 
contribution 
went mostly unseen, but it was 
quietly one of the Wolverines’ 
biggest 
strengths. 
Whether 
through clutch kicking, long 
punts or electric returns, the 
special 
teams 
helped 
keep 
Michigan in some games and 
turned others into blowouts.
Junior punter Will Hart was 
a revelation. After spending 
last season backing up then-
freshman Brad Robbins, Hart 
stepped into the spotlight after 
Robbins 
missed 
the 
entire 
season with an injury. He 
punted for an average of 49.98 
yards with a long of 65, while 
totaling 19 punts of at least 50 
yards. That earned him the Big 
Ten Punter of the Year award 
and a first-team All-Big Ten 
nod.
While the other positions 
were more unsettled, many 
contributors 
stepped 
up, 
especially 
on 
the 
return 
unit. Sophomore safety Brad 
Hawkins and freshman wide 
receiver 
Ronnie 
Bell 
both 
contributed, and Bell ripped 
off a 53-yard kick return in the 
Peach Bowl that showcased 
his future potential as a return 
man.
HIGH POINT: Michigan’s 
offense had stalled — again. 
Jake Moody came to bail it out 
— again.
It was late in the fourth 

quarter and Indiana — a team 
that had no business sticking 
with the Wolverines this long 
— had just scored a touchdown 
to cut Michigan’s lead to eight. 
With the game down to one 
score, the Wolverines needed a 
safety net, and when they faced 
fourth down again, Moody got 
the call.
His 29-yard attempt sailed 
straight through.
The kick was his sixth field 
goal on the day. Not only was it a 
program record, it was Moody’s 
first 
game 
placekicking. 
Previously, Moody had stuck 
to kickoff duties, but with 
Michigan’s 
normal 
kicker, 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Quinn 
Nordin, out with an illness, 
it was Moody’s turn to step 
up. The Wolverines won the 
game, 31-20, largely thanks to 
Moody’s contributions.
Moody’s 
breakout 
game 
also 
provided 
some 
much-
needed stability to the kicking 
corps. Nordin has a strong 
leg, but was prone to misses 
from easy distances. Due to 
his performance against the 
Hoosiers, Moody started the 
remaining two games of the 
season and hit four of his five 
attempts, including a 48-yarder 
against Florida in the Peach 
Bowl.
LOW POINT: At halftime 
against Wisconsin, there was 
frustration.
Michigan 
had 
thoroughly 
outplayed 
the 
Badgers 
to 
that point, but led by just six. 
Against a team like Wisconsin, 
it seemed like the Wolverines’ 
trouble finishing drives could 
come back to bite them.
The slim lead was partially 
thanks to one of Nordin’s bad 
days. After missing a field goal 
in the first quarter, he missed 
another just before halftime, 
squandered a pair of promising 
drives.
Nordin’s misses ultimately 
didn’t 
come 
back 
to 
bite 
Michigan as it pulled away in 
the second half to win, 38-13, 
but they showed the potential 
dangers that could come with 

an inconsistent kicker — part 
of the reason Moody eventually 
took over the starting role.
Against the Hoosiers, the 
kicking unit bailed out its 
offense when not much was 
working. Against the Badgers, 
the offense was there to bail out 
its kickers at their low point.
THE 
FUTURE: 
The 
Wolverines’ special teams in 
2018 were largely populated 
by fresh faces. Of the main 
contributors, only Hart was 
an upperclassman, and he still 
has one more year of eligibility. 
That bodes well for the future, 
as more development from its 
young players will bolster an 
already strong unit.
That’s particularly true of the 
returners. Sophomore receiver 
Donovan Peoples-Jones at punt 
return and the committee of 
Thomas, Hawkins and Bell at 

kick return certainly flashed 
potential. 
Peoples-Jones 
scored an electric touchdown 
against Nebraska, employing 
his signature spin move to take 
a punt to the house. Facing 
an 18-point deficit late in the 
second quarter against Notre 
Dame, Thomas scored a kick-
return 
touchdown 
to 
give 
Michigan hope of a comeback.
But with it, its inexperience 
showed as well. Against Ohio 
State, Thomas caught a kick 
that was about to sail over 
his head and out of bounds, 
significantly 
hurting 
the 
Wolverines’ field position in a 
critical moment. Both he and 
Peoples-Jones 
occasionally 
made mental mistakes that 
spurred questions over whether 
their roles would be better 
filled by someone else.
The extra year of experience 

will help combat those slip-
ups, and Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh’s 
willingness 
to 
try others at punt and kick 
return will give other speedy 
young players, like Bell, a 
chance to emerge. Meanwhile, 
Peoples-Jones’ spin move and 
Thomas’ blazing speed give 
the group large upside despite 
inconsistency.
Should 
Nordin 
and 
Moody 
both 
remain 
with 
the 
team, 
Nordin’s 
range 
could 
complement 
Moody’s 
consistency. 
Moody’s 
only 
missed field goal on the year 
was from 52 yards — a distance 
Nordin has shown he can 
hit. Moody will likely handle 
regular kicking duties in the 
future, but Nordin could come 
in to try long attempts and give 
the Wolverines a higher ceiling.
Meanwhile, after cementing 

his status as one of the top 
punters in the nation, Hart has 
one year left to build on his 
success. Big Ten games have a 
reputation for being defensive 
battles where field position is 
key. Against Michigan State — 
a game in which offense was 
hard to come by — Hart punted 
eight times for an average 
of 45.8 yards, including a 
65-yarder. Michigan will likely 
have more such games in the 
future, and Hart has shown 
that he can put his team in a 
good position to win by making 
opposing offenses work that 
much harder.
Overall, the special teams 
had unsung success for the 
Wolverines this season, and the 
unit’s youth and emergence of 
new stars bode well for another 
year of helping Michigan win 
behind the scenes.

From Will Hart to Jake Moody to Donovan Peoples-Jones and more, Michigan brings back much of its special teams

EVAN AARON/Daily
Freshman kicker Jake Moody made four of his five kicks against Florida in the Peach Bowl after taking the kicker’s job from Quinn Nordin during the season.

Somehow, 
Isaiah 
Livers 
caught the pass, legs in the air, 
teetering on the edge of the 
court. His pink shoes barely 
landed in bounds as he lobbed 
the ball to Jordan Poole.
The 
possession 
started 
with junior center Jon Teske 
rebounding his missed layup, 
then getting down on the floor, 
fighting for a loose ball and 
shoveling it to junior guard 
Zavier Simpson. It ended with 
Poole catching the ball at 
halfcourt and finding Teske, 
wide open on the perimeter for 
three — his second triple in the 
first five minutes.
It was that kind of night for 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team (25-4 overall, 14-4 Big 
Ten), who got off to a quick 
start and never 
relented, 
winning 
82-53 
over 
Nebraska 
(15-14, 5-13) in 
the final home 
game 
of 
the 
season.
“We 
jumped 
on 
them 
right 
away,” 
Teske 
said. “I wasn’t 
expecting 
to 
win by 30 (but) 
we played well, got on them 
early, which helps. Offensively, 
defensively, we really got on 
them tonight.”
Shots were falling no matter 
who was on the court. With 
redshirt junior wing Charles 
Matthews out with an ankle 
injury, 
others 
— 
including 
sophomore 
forward 
Isaiah 
Livers, freshman guard David 
DeJulius and freshman forward 
Colin Castleton — were forced 
to contribute, and that they did.
Matthews’ absence proved to 
be no problem. Livers, who got 
the start in his place, started 

off the game by rattling in a 
contested trey. He finished 
with 12 points and 10 rebounds 
for his first career double-
double.
“Charles, he does a lot of 
great things,” Livers said. “I 
tried to replace him as best as 
I could, trying 
to grab 50-50 
balls, 
just 
knock 
open 
shots 
and 
go 
dunk on other 
people’s heads. 
… But without 
Charles, 
nothing’s really 
gonna change. 
The ball’s still 
gonna 
move, 
shots are still 
gonna go in. We’re still gonna 
be Michigan.”
Seconds after subbing in, 
meanwhile, Castleton — whose 
last points were in December 
— slipped in a layup. When 
he scored his final points on 
a jumper with 1:24 left in the 
second half, cementing his 
11-point breakout game, he 
exited to a standing ovation.
After Nebraska cut the lead to 
17 by forcing a three-and-a-half 
minute field goal drought, Teske 
responded by sinking another 
3-pointer. 
Two 
possessions 
later, 
Simpson 
grabbed 
a 

rebound and tossed a half-court 
pass to Poole. Poole threw down 
a thunderous one-handed dunk, 
skidding across the floor before 
calmly sinking the and-one.
But Teske was the real star 
of the show. He was a matchup 
nightmare for Nebraska, driving 
to the basket at will and drawing 
fouls when he couldn’t hit a shot 
for a career-high 22 points. 
After he completed the double-
double with his 10th rebound, 
Teske hit a layup on the ensuing 
possession for the cherry on top, 
then subbed out for the final 
time, giving the freshmen and 
walk-ons a go at it.
“Jon did not take a three in 
practice the last two days,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. “ 
… All of a sudden he just grabs 
it and shoots it in and does it 
again, so I think that set the 
stage. It seems this is part of 
the mental edge, it seems on 
Senior Nights, this happens 
all the time. There’s just this, 
all of a sudden, we’re playing, 
and maybe we’re playing more 
relaxed as well.”
After the game was over and 
Senior Night festivities done, 
the Wolverines stood in the 
Maize Rage section, singing the 
fight song in front of their home 
crowd for the final time this 
season.
They were nothing but smiles.

Ignas Brazdeikis hit the floor 
and 12,707 hearts stopped.
The freshman forward lay on 
his back, clutching his left knee 
in pain, and all of Michigan’s 
worst fears seemed to be coming 
to fruition.
On 
Wednesday, 
the 
Wolverines found out Charles 
Matthews wouldn’t be able to 
suit up for his own Senior Night 
with a right ankle injury. Now, 
their leading scorer was down on 
the ground after a collison under 
the basket just 13 seconds before 
halftime.
A trainer helped him up, and 
Brazdeikis gingerly made his 
way to the bench under his own 
power. When he took the floor 
to start the second half, Crisler 
Center exhaled. By the time he 
hit his fourth 3-pointer of the 
game, Michigan led by 24 with 
seven minutes remaining, and 
the harrowing moment at the end 
of the first half was a forgotten 
footnote in the Wolverines’ 82-53 
win over Nebraska on Thursday.
“I sprinted over and I was like, 
‘Please no, please no, please no,’” 
said sophomore forward Isaiah 
Livers. “He said he was alright, 
he probably just tweaked it a 
little bit. … You see his playing, he 
hit four threes, so he was playing 
very well after that.”
And so was everyone else 
wearing a maize jersey. Michigan 
scored its most points since Dec. 
8. It shot 56 percent from the 
field and 55 percent from three. It 
recorded 19 assists on its 30 made 
baskets. Brazdeikis, Livers, junior 
center Jon Teske and freshman 
forward 
Colin 
Castleton 
all 
scored in double-figures.
It was the Wolverines’ most 
dominant performance in weeks, 
and it couldn’t have come at a 
better time.
“Great bounce-back for our 
guys after the other day,” said 

Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“It was great that we turned it 
around, coaching staff turned it 
around.”
The “other day,” of course, 
was the Wolverines’ 77-70 loss to 
Michigan State, in which it blew 
a six-point lead with 15 minutes 
remaining. With or without 
Matthews, Michigan needed a 
response in the worst way.
“We had a bad taste in our 
mouths,” Teske said. “We wanted 
to come out defensively, just 
shut them down and offensively, 
knock down open shots.”
The Wolverines did that from 
the start. Livers, who replaced 
Matthews in the starting lineup, 
nailed his first three just two 
minutes into the game. Teske 
— who didn’t attempt a three in 
practice the last two days, per 
Beilein — hit from the left wing 
on the next trip down the court, 
and Michigan was up, 8-2, and 
off and running.
When a team loses a rivalry 
game 
in 
the 
fashion 
the 
Wolverines did Sunday, bouncing 
back is the obvious storyline. 
That kind of mental response is 
intangible. What isn’t, though, 
was Michigan’s extreme height 
advantage over the Cornhuskers, 
who play only one player taller 
than 6-foot-8.
Teske (22 points and 10 
rebounds) 
and 
Castleton 
(11 points in nine minutes) 
stand 
7-foot-1 
and 
6-foot-
11, 
respectively. 
Nebraska 
didn’t have an answer, as the 
Wolverines had no trouble in 
finding their big men down 
low — and occasionally, on the 
perimeter, where Teske hit all 
three of his 3-pointers.
“We knew if we go harder off 
the screen that they were gonna 
switch,” Livers said. “So when 
we see that you got a 7-footer 
and a 6-foot-10 guy with long 
arms, they know how to keep 
the ball above their head, that’s 
an easy assist and easy bucket. It 

was great to see that they were 
playing big today instead of just 
playing small.”
That performance was quietly 
engineered 
by 
Michigan’s 
backcourt. Nothing junior Zavier 
Simpson or sophomore Jordan 
Poole did was electrifying — 
save for Poole’s out-of-nowhere 
tomahawk dunk in the second 
half.
But in a way, that was the 
point. Simpson and Poole’s job 
was simple: find the open man — 
usually a big man — and keep the 
ball moving. With just six shot 
attempts, but 15 assists combined 
between them, they did just that.
“They didn’t have to shoot 
the ball to make us win,” Beilein 
said. “The ball moved. Yesterday 
in practice, we could see the ball 
move. Didn’t stick like it has in 
some games. That’s how you 
score 80 points.”
As for the mental response?
“Maybe we’re playing more 
relaxed as well,” Beilein said. 
“After we got beat the other day, 
I think people just say, ‘OK, we 
learned a great lesson, let’s just 
go out there and take the next 
right shot and don’t worry about 
it. Don’t press to try and show 
anything, just make the next 
right play.’ ”
It’s been a theme this year, 
according to players and coaches 
— 
Michigan 
plays 
its 
best 
basketball when it plays freely 
and without tension. And as the 
Cornhuskers were reminded, the 
Wolverines are quite good when 
they play their best basketball.
“If they’re gonna play for 
a 
conference 
championship, 
you can’t lose at home,” said 
Nebraska 
coach 
Tim 
Miles. 
“Certainly can’t lose at home to 
a 10th place team. … I think that 
just (Michigan) making shots 
early deflated our guys some. But 
hey, this is not a league where 
you can feel sorry for yourself.”
After 
Sunday’s 
loss, 
the 
Wolverines didn’t.
