Hilary 
Clinton 
made 

history this past presidential 
election cycle after securing 
the 
Democratic 
nomination 

for the 2016 election as the 
first female to ever win a major 
party 
nomination, 
promoting 

excitement among many young 
voters including on campus. 
However, the election of her 
opponent, 
President-elect 

Donald Trump, has sparked 
concern over what his presidency 
will mean for women’s rights for 
many students.

While 
Clinton 
wasn’t 

successful in her bid for the 
White House, there is discussion 

regarding 
the 
inspirational 

effects Clinton’s campaign will 
have on young girls interested in 
politics. While her being the first 
female nominee wasn’t a center 
point of her campaign, it became 
a focal point in her concession 
speech as she reminded aspiring 
female 
politicians 
to 
keep 

working toward their goals, 
despite her loss.

“To all the little girls who are 

watching this, never doubt that 
you are valuable and powerful 
and deserving of every chance 
and opportunity in the world to 
pursue and achieve your own 
dreams,” she said in her speech.

LSA senior Lauren Gallagher, 

president of the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of Students 

In a testimony before City 

Council Thursday night that 
silenced the chamber, Khita 
Whyatt, lecturer of dance in the 
University of Michigan’s School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance, 
recounted a recent incident 
when four men knocked her 
to the ground while shouting 
epithets last Thursday morning 
on Observatory Street. 

“I was getting ready to go and 

lecture … when I felt something 
coming at me and when I looked 
up there were four young men 
running full-tilt at me with a 
full-arm body block, arms out, 
and they told me ‘Go home,’ 
” 
Whyatt 
said. 
“And 
they 

slammed me, lifted me in the air 
and I fell flat on my ass and saw 
stars.”

Whyatt said she chose to 

reveal her identity by speaking 
out publicly in order to bring 
attention to a recent spate of 
local hate crimes and call for 
action. Ted Annis, Whyatt’s 
partner, suggested in an email 
to 
a 
neighborhood 
watch 

association 
that 
she 
was 

targeted because she is of dark 
complexion due to her Native 
American descent.

“I’d like to say this was the 

only time I’ve been assaulted 
in Ann Arbor and it is not; it 
is the fourth time I have been 
assaulted in Ann Arbor, and 
the second hate crime,” Whyatt 
said. “People need to understand 

what’s going on. There’s a lot 
more hate crimes happening in 
recent weeks. There needs to be 
a dialogue … so people can come 
forward in order to be able to 
feel safe.”

Whyatt 
explained 
in 
an 

interview after her testimony 
that she did not immediately 
call the police because she 
was 
so 
shocked, 
but 
her 

department chair contacted the 
Department of Public Safety 

and Security. Two days after 
the incident, Whyatt said she 
was interviewed by two DPSS 
officers who told her it was 
“obviously” a hate crime.

While they both described 

DPSS’s 
response 
as 
“great, 

initially,” Whyatt and Annis said 
they were concerned that an 
alert hadn’t yet been sent to the 
University community as has 
been the case following similar 
incidents. The University has 

released two crime alerts over 
the past two weeks of hate 
crimes on campus. It has not 
released a crime alert about the 
event Whyatt referenced as of 
Tuesday evening. 

“I laid (the lack of public 

alert) off to the (University) 
bureaucracy and was willing to 
give them a day or two of grace,” 
Annis said. “If they are silent 24 
hours from now, then I have a 

Last week, the University 

of 
Michigan 
announced 
a 

partnership 
with 
Chinese 

institutions to solve and improve 
global problems including the 
need for clean water technology 
and new transportation methods 
for future generations.

Though 
some 
of 
the 

agreements are still preliminary, 
the partnership has received 
an approximate $54 million 
to 
jumpstart 
their 
research 

projects.

S. Jack Hu, vice president 

for research at the University, 
and Gov. Rick Snyder have been 
working in China for the past 
month, collaborating with local 
companies to create a plan of 
action.

“Over the past month, we 

signed two research agreements 
and 
one 
Memorandum 
of 

understanding,” Hu wrote in an 
email interview. “These are three 
different partnerships.”

According to Hu, a primary 

component 
of

five-year 

partnership is a memorandum 
of 
understanding

University of Michigan president Mark Schlissel at the University Senate Assembly Meeting at Palmer Commons Monday.

GOVERNMENT

About 60 of the 74 voting 

members of the University of 
Michigan 
Senate 
Assembly 

convened Monday evening to 
hear University President Mark 
Schlissel speak about the next 

steps after University Provost 
Martha 
Pollack 
leaves 
her 

position later this academic year.

The assembly also decided 

who will fill the board for the 
recently established tri-campus 
task 
force, 
which 
aims 
to 

reduce miscommunication and 
encourage cooperation among the 
University’s Flint, Dearborn and 

Ann Arbor campuses.

As 
was 
announced 
in 

November, 
Pollack 
will 
be 

leaving her position early in 
April to become president of 
Cornell 
University. 
Schlissel 

said an interim candidate will be 
decided on soon while a search 
committee is being formed to 
consider candidates for the role 

permanently.

“I would like to do an open 

search, which means that we’ll 
consider both internal candidates 
as well as outstanding external 
candidates,” 
Schlissel 
said. 

“We’ll form a search committee 
in which the faculty will be 
heavily represented … the student

A 
group 
of 
University 

of 
Michigan 
faculty 

members have developed a 
monitored Canvas site called 
Teamworks, which will allow 
students who do not feel safe 
on campus to connect with 
one another to walk home and 
around campus.

Teamworks will be open 

to students by permission 
only 
and 
interested 

individuals must email Anne 
Berg, assistant director of 
undergraduate studies and 
the primary faculty member 
on 
the 
projectm 
to 
gain 

access.

The site comes in response 

to a number of incidents that 
have happened on campus 

following 
the 
election 
of 

Donald Trump two weeks 
ago. 
Just 
days 
after 
the 

election, a female student 
was told to remove her hijab 
or she would be lit on fire, 
and another female student 
was pushed down a hill and 
yelled at for being in America. 

In addition, a male student 
woke up to a swastika painted 
on his apartment door last 
weekend, and a woman’s face 
was cut by an unknown man 
last Tuesday while walking 
on Liberty Street.

Other groups on campus 

have 
initiated 
similar 

programs 
in 
the 
past, 

including SafeRide, a free 
service 
that 
transports 

students, faculty and staff 
within a one-mile radius of 
campus. 
Additionally, 
five 

Ross 
School 
of 
Business 

students 
developed 
the 

now-internationally 
recognized Companion app 
last year. S.A.F.E. WALK, 
a 
campus 
accompaniment 

service coordinated by the 
Department of Public Safety 
and Security, also provides 
walking 
partners 
free 
of 

charge 
to 
all 
University 

members.

In the aftermath of the four 

incidents, other organizations 
have also been holding self-
defense 
programs 
more 

frequently. Beyond the Diag, a 
program provided to students 
living off-campus, held a self-
defense workshop just after 
the election. The University 
International 
Center 
will 

hold a self-defense session 
Saturday 
at 
the 
Trotter 

Multicultural Center.

As a result of crimes occurring near 

campus in recent weeks, the University 

of Michigan Department of Public 

Security and Safety has bolstered 

security in hopes of preventing future 

incidents.

University Police spokeswoman 

Diane Brown said DPSS is taking 

necessary precautions to ensure the 

safety of students, faculty and staff.

“The University police indeed have 

increased their patrols particularly in 

the Central Campus area due to the fact 

that these incidents have been reported 

to be right near Central Campus,” she 

said. “I’m also aware that the Ann 

Arbor Police have done likewise.”

DPSS has released two crime 

alerts in the past two weeks, both 

for incidents classified as ethnic 

intimidation, a type of hate crime.

On the evening of Nov. 11, a student 

was approached on East William Street 

near South State Street by a man who 

demanded she remove her hijab. The 

man threatened to set her on fire if she 

did not comply. On Nov. 12, a female 

student near the intersection of South 

University Avenue and Washtenaw 

Avenue was approached by two men 

who pushed her down a hill after 

yelling at her about being in America 

and making religious references.

Brown said DPSS hopes people will 

contact police as soon as possible upon 

witnessing an offense to minimize any 

further threats.

“We are also very attuned to 

listening for any other reports of 

suspicious activity and hopeful that 

people indeed will be contacting police 

when incidents do occur,” she said. 

“The sooner they contact police, the 

more likelihood there is for police to 

still be able to find perpetrators in 

whatever location the incident might 

happen or at least be able to clarify if 

the suspicious activity is benign.”

A third campus incident occurred 

on the afternoon of Nov. 15 when 

an unknown man cut a woman’s 

face with a safety pin on East 

Liberty Street, which is still under 

investigation, according to Brown. 

It is currently listed as an assault — 

not an aggravated assault or ethnic 

intimidation.

“We’re working with the 

Ann Arbor Police to monitor any 

developments that they might have in 

this incident,” she said. “Right now it’s 

a non-aggravated assault. They haven’t 

confirmed elements of a hate crime.”

for Hillary, said while Clinton’s 
loss was upsetting, she has hope 
for the future.

“Having a woman running for 

the highest office shows girls that 
they do have the ability to run for 
office,” she said. “I heard a quote 
that the first female president was 
watching Hillary run, so in our 
lifetimes there will be a female 
president and I’m really confident 
about that.”

Gallagher noted it wasn’t just 

securing the nomination that 
made this election so unique for 
women. On the Republican side, 
Carly Fiorina made it further 
in the nomination process than 
any other previous Republican 
woman. In addition, many notable 
women joined Clinton on the 
campaign trail.

“Clinton also just surrounded 

herself 
with 
strong 
women,” 

she said. “We saw actresses, 
business leaders, all of these 
women speaking out about issues 
they have faced and how they 
have overcome them and we saw 
Clinton echoing that same story.”

However, 
amid 
those 

advancements, students have also 
voiced their concern for the future 
of women’s rights in the coming 
years.

Business 
sophomore 
Mira 

Sanghvi, 
director 
of 
special 

projects of the University’s chapter 
of nonprofit organization Lean In, 
said Trump’s election made her 
more than just sad for Clinton’s 
loss, but scared as someone 
who identifies as a woman of 
color, given the president-elect’s 
derogatory 
statements 
about 

women and minority groups.

During the campaign, Trump 

has made numerous comments 
about limiting access to heath 
care 
by 
defunding 
Planned 

Parenthood, something his Vice 
President-elect Mike Pence has 
worked to defund during his 
time as governor of Indiana. 
Additionally, Trump’s push for 
stricter immigration laws amid his 
comments condemning Muslim, 
Black and Latino residents has 
been a cause for concern. 

“I don’t really understand what 

America stands for anymore,” 
she said. “I understand the 
Conservative 
viewpoint, 
but 

this time around I really didn’t 

understand why someone would 
be prompted to vote for him just 
because he has said so many 
horrible things about so many 
different types of people. How 
could we go from possibly electing 
the first female president to 
someone who has no experience? 
I hate to say this but I have a lot 
of resentment because I don’t 
understand why this country put 
him in power.”

Michael 
Heaney, 
assistant 

professor of political science and 
organizational 
studies 
at 
the 

University of Michigan, said he 
believes one of the many factors 
that contributed to Clinton’s loss 
could have been her treatment by 
the media as a woman.

“It’s complicated because of the 

way she lost,” he said. “One of the 
things that we would have to say 
was that misogyny was a major 
component of her loss. That in 
and of itself is very discouraging. 
Trump made a lot of negative 
comments and Trump supporters 
made very misogynistic comments 
towards her. That wasn’t the 
only reason she lost but it was a 
significant factor.”

Business and LSA senior Ujwala 

Murthy, co-founder and director 
or marketing and public relations 
of Lean In, said she thought this 
campaign was not only filled with 
misogynistic comments, but also 
saw a portrayal of Clinton in a 
negative light, in ways Trump was 
not.

“I think there was a lot of 

baggage that Clinton carried but 
her flaws came under stricter 
scrutiny compared to Trump,” 
she said. “Fox News focused a 
lot on her wrinkles and health 
which wasn’t a focus of any of the 
male candidates. Women are now 
running for public office and as a 
society we need to overcome that.”

Gallagher also said she believes 

this election showed the diversity 
among women as a voting bloc in 
what candidates they supported.

“I think this election cycle 

in particular really brought the 
realization that women don’t 
make up a voting bloc,” she said. 
“I think oftentimes strategists 
and campaigns think of women 
as one bloc of voters that will vote 
together. Thinking that all women 
would vote for Clinton because 
of the statements Trump made 
against women, that was really a 
pitfall of the campaign in general.”

In terms of females in the U.S. 

government, this cycle did see 
some women elected to Congress. 
However, a consistent rise in 
the proportion of women in 
Congress, women didn’t progress 
in terms of seat allocation for 
the 115th Congress. In addition, 
the 
Republican 
Congressional 

leadership for 2017 will only 
feature one woman — down from 
three women who held positions 
in the previous session.

Heaney said globally the United 

States ranks relatively low in terms 
of women serving in executive 
positions.

“That is for a whole variety 

of reasons,” he said. “Women 
are discouraged from entering 
political careers to begin with 
and that has to do with all of the 
reasons as to why women don’t 
advance as far as men do in a 
variety of professions. There are 
family considerations and also 
being more discouraged by the 
negative politics than men are. 
And also the way they are likely 
to be treated when they run for 
office.”

For Murthy, the lack of female 

representation 
in 
government 

and the rhetoric she saw from the 
GOP side during the campaign 
season has left her worried about 
what this means for the future of 
women’s rights.

“Considering the agendas of 

a lot of what Trump and Senate 
Republicans might have in mind, 
Clinton’s 
loss 
really 
pushed 

women’s progress back,” she said. 
“Personally, I think that women 
will have to fight harder for things 
such as equal pay. There’s the pro-
choice pro-life debate obviously, 
and for some reason Roe v. Wade is 
still on the table as something that 
can be overturned.”

Echoing 
those 
concerns, 

Sanghvi hopes Clinton’s loss will 
inspire women to keep working 
for the issues they are passionate 
about.

“I don’t think Clinton’s loss will 

discourage women,” she said. “I 
think it will do the exact opposite. I 
think women will understand that 
although this this was a setback, I 
think it will ignite this passion that 
will drive women to work harder 
because we essentially have a 
president that has propagated 
sexual assault and I think that will 
ignite a lot of women to stand up 
for their rights.”

A group of University of 

Michigan 
faculty 
members 

have developed a monitored 
Canvas site called Teamworks, 
which will allow students who 
do not feel safe on campus to 
connect with one another 
to walk home and around 
campus.

Teamworks will be open 

to students by permission 
only 
and 
interested 

individuals must email Anne 
Berg, assistant director of 
undergraduate 
studies 
and 

the primary faculty member 
on the projectm to gain access.

The site comes in response 

to a number of incidents that 
have happened on campus 
following 
the 
election 
of 

Donald Trump two weeks ago. 
Just days after the election, 
a female student was told to 
remove her hijab or she would 
be lit on fire, and another 
female student was pushed 
down a hill and yelled at for 
being in America. In addition, 
a male student woke up to 
a swastika painted on his 
apartment door last weekend, 
and a woman’s face was cut by 
an unknown man last Tuesday 
while 
walking 
on 
Liberty 

Street.

Other groups on campus 

have 
initiated 
similar 

programs 
in 
the 
past, 

including SafeRide, a free 
service 
that 
transports 

students, faculty and staff 
within a one-mile radius of 
campus. 
Additionally, 
five 

Ross 
School 
of 
Business 

students 
developed 
the 

now-internationally 
recognized Companion app 
last 
year. 
S.A.F.E. 
WALK, 

a 
campus 
accompaniment 

service coordinated by the 
Department of Public Safety 
and Security, also provides 
walking 
partners 
free 
of 

charge 
to 
all 
University 

members.

In the aftermath of the four 

incidents, other organizations 
have also been holding self-
defense 
programs 
more 

frequently. Beyond the Diag, a 
program provided to students 
living off-campus, held a self-
defense workshop just after 
the election. The University 
International 
Center 
will 

hold a self-defense session 
Saturday 
at 
the 
Trotter 

Multicultural Center.

Beijing Institute for Collaborative 
Innovation aims to establish a 
Global Collaboratory in Water 
Technology. Lutgarde Raskin, a 
University professor for civil and 
environmental engineering, will 
lead the collaboration for clean 
water technology. which he wrote 
is integral in providing resources 
to people across the globe.

“The Collaboratory’s goal is 

to identify technology gaps in 
water treatment and monitor and 
develop solutions to provide clean 
and safe water to the world’s 
urban environments,” he wrote.

Funding for the University’s 

partnership 
of 
$25 
million 

will be provided by the Beijing 
Institute, an organization of 14 
Chinese universities. The project 
anticipates 
three 
locations: 

Beijing, 
Shenzhen 
and 
Ann 

Arbor, with the funding equally 
distributed between sites. The 
full research agreement for the 
three institutions is scheduled to 
be signed in 2017.

The second project, a research 

agreement with Frontt Capital 
Management, a Shenzhen-based 
investment firm, aims to make 
advancements in autonomous 
and connected vehicles as well 
as in robotic technologies.

The $27 million collaboration 

with the firm will establish 
a 
joint 
research 
center 
for 

intelligent 
vehicles 
at 
the 

University 
and 
a 
robotics 

laboratory on North Campus. 
There will also be support for 

University researchers to design 
a testing facility in Shenzhen, 
which will resemble the unique 
transportation system in urban-
suburban China.

Huei 
Peng, 
director 
of 

the 
University’s 
Mobility 

Transformation 
Center 
and 

professor 
of 
mechanical 

engineering, will be leading the 
third project: the University 
of 
Michigan-Sokon 
Research 

Center, a $2.5 million research 
agreement 
between 
the 

University and the Chongqing 
Sokon Industry Group.

This agreement aims to spur 

pilot research on connected 
and 
automated 
vehicles 
in 

collaboration with faculty and 
students from the University and 
the Chongqing Sokon Industry 
Group.

The Chongqing Sokon Industry 

Group, a public company based in 
southwest China, works with the 
construction and distribution of 
auto parts and will be building 
an 
independent 
tech 
center 

in Michigan, along with the 
University reserach center.

“The automotive industry has 

existed for more than a century, 
so it is a very important element 
of our daily lives,” Peng said. 
“It’s important that we develop 
technologies 
together 
with 

companies that have the final 
users in mind. In other words, 
safety, energy consumption and 
mobility needs are always very 
important. We don’t want to 
develop future vehicles without 
considering what people need.”

Peng said the establishment 

of Sokon’s branch office tech 

center in Michigan will also 
provide University students with 
new research opportunities and 
future jobs in the industry.

“We, as University professors, 

try to find opportunities to 
work with both federal funding 
agencies and company sponsors 
to 
get 
resources 
that 
are 

necessary to educate students 
and conduct research,” he said.

The partnership will push 

for 
new 
technologies, 
Peng 

said, 
including 
electric 
and 

automotive vehicles. He added 
that the University has been 
closely working with automotive 
engineering since the beginning 
of the auto industry.

Regarding the incorporation 

of these new technologies in 
learning 
opportunities 
for 

University students, Peng said 
he thinks resources should be 
available to students, and that 
they should be a part of the 
research process.

“It is very important that 

students not only understand 
the theory behind many of 
the phenomena, but it’s also 
important to have hands-on 
experience,” he said.

Hu wrote that all of these 

partnerships 
complement 

existing 
research 
at 
the 

University and let it be engaged 
worldwide.

“Safe 
and 
sustainable 

transportation, safe and clean 
water are societal challenges 
across 
the 
globe,” 
he 
said. 

“Having 
such 
partnerships 

allows 
our 
researchers 
to 

conduct research that will have 
global impact.”

will be affected by it?” Ubong 
said.

Those who were remembered 

Monday night included Jazz 
Alford, 
30, 
who 
was 
shot 

and killed in a hotel room in 
Birmingham, Ala. in September 
by a man who was also charged 
with 
shooting 
and 
robbing 

another transgender woman.

Also remembered and named 

during the vigil was Kayden 
Clarke, 24, a transgender male 
from Mesa, Ariz. with Asperger’s 
who was killed by police officers 
following a domestic dispute.

Mari Brighe, Spectrum Center 

graduate 
communications 

coordinator and a contributor 
for The Advocate, the country’s 
oldest 
and 
largest 
LGBTQ 

publication, spoke as well. She 

discussed 
her 
experiences 

as a trans issues writer for 
The Advocate and her goal to 
preserve the memories of those 
who have suffered or lost their 
lives because of their identity.

“During my time at The 

Advocate, it’s been a solemn duty 
of mine to ensure that those lives 
that have been so tragically taken 
by the forces of hate do not slip 
from this world in anonymity,” 
she said.

Brighe also detailed statistics 

about 
violence 
committed 

against transgender people and 
allies, including 26 murders in 
the United States and 295 across 
the world so far this year.

“All too often the vitriol 

spewed by transphobic bigots 
focuses on dehumanizing us,” 
she said. “These are human lives, 
not just tragic statistics.” 

According 
to 
the 
Human 

Rights Campaign, at least 21 

transgender people have died 
in 2016, most of them people 
of color. Brighe expressed fear 
that this number will grow, 
which she said has already been 
happening 
during 
President 

Barack Obama’s terms.

“Under 
President 
Obama, 

who has done more for our 
community than any president 
in history, we’ve seen rates of 
transgender violence grow year 
after year,” she said. “What can 
we expect with four years of 
President Trump? … How many 
more names are we going to have 
to read a year from now?”

Brighe said those against the 

transgender community have 
tried to demonize transgender 
people to pass laws that impact 
the community. She cited specific 
legislation that was passed this 
March in North Carolina, stating 
that people have to use the 
public bathroom aligning with 

their biological sex regardless of 
gender identity.

“When we’re nameless and 

faceless, it’s much easier to turn 
us into scary bathroom peeping 
monsters instead of just nice 
folks who occasionally need to 
pee someplace other than our 
homes,” she said.

The 
North 
Carolina 
law 

has faced heavy criticism and 
resulted in many high-profile 
canceled concerts and relocated 
sporting events. A similar law was 
proposed by Michigan state Sen. 
Tom Casperson (R–Escanaba) 
in June after discovering a 
proposed recommendation that 
public schools allow transgender 
students to use the bathrooms 
with which they identify. The law 
would similarly restrict students 
to the restrooms corresponding 
to the sex listed on their birth 
certificate.

After 
Brighe 
spoke, 
the 

audience took to the Cube for a 
vigil while holding candles and 
strips of paper with the names 
of victims of anti-transgender 
violence on them, taking turns 
reading them aloud.

Spectrum 
Center 
Director 

Will 
Sherry 
said 
he 
hopes 

students 
reflect 
on 
their 

experience at the event and 
consider their positions in the 
community, 
especially 
when 

it comes to their safety and 
privilege.

“(Tonight was about) having a 

time to think about what safety 
means in their own lives, the 
ways in which they might feel 
unsafe, as well as the privileges 
that they might have and connect 
with someone else who can be 
a source of support when they 
need it,” he said.

Social Work student Jazz 

McGinnis, who attended the 
event, said he felt an obligation 

to come as a member of the 
transgender community. 

“As a trans person, it’s very 

important for me to show up for 
my community and mourn the 
folks that we lost the past year,” 
he said.

McGinnis 
said 
he 
also 

felt that the University has 
made efforts to accommodate 
transgender students. According 
to the Campus Pride Index, the 
University was named one of the 
most LGBTQ-friendly schools in 
the country. However, McGinnis 
said he still does not feel 
comfortable with his identity on 
campus.

“The 
University 
has 

prioritized trans students and 
policies like gender inclusive 
bathrooms and made sure that 
folks can identify their correct 
pronouns … But I also think it’s 
still a struggle being here,” he 
said.

big problem.”

DPSS 
spokeswoman 
Diane 

Brown wrote in a text message 
interview Tuesday evening that 
she had nothing to add regarding 
Whyatt’s account, and added she 
would look further into the issue 
of why a crime alert was not 
released.

Following 
Whyatt’s 

testimony, Councilmember Sumi 
Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1), fighting 
tears, said she has received an 
unprecedented surge in calls 
and emails from constituents 
concerned 
about 
the 
recent 

incidences of hate crimes she 
called for empathy for the victims.

“I myself was a refugee. When 

I was 15 years old, my house was 
completely burned down in Sri 
Lanka during the 1983 riots. I 
myself was an illegal immigrant in 
India as a refugee,” Kailasapathy 
said. “Because of other people’s 
kindness, it’s how I survived and I 
will make sure I do the same thing 
for people in this community.”

Mayor 
Christopher 
Taylor 

echoed Kailasapathy by saying all 
Ann Arbor residents deserve to 
feel safe.

“There’s been really shameful 

acts of intimidation and violence,” 
Taylor said. “And it’s important 
that we all stand with the victims 
of intimidation and aggression, 
and that people do indeed have 
an unshakable right to live free 
from harassment and that right 

is regrettably under present and 
increasing threat.”

In an email from University 

President Mark Schlissel that was 
shared by Wyatt with the Daily, 
Schlissel expressed sympathy for 
her and promised the University 
community 
would 
remain 

watchful in the face of such 
incidents.

“While you were clearly the 

direct victim of this awful act, 
I considerthis also an attack on 
our entire community,” Schlissel 
wrote. 
“We 
will 
continue 

to increase our vigilance in 
protecting all members of the Un 
iversity of Michigan community 
and denouncing hate, bigotry, and 
in this case, violence.”

community has already reached 
out to me requesting some kind of 
input regarding the search.”

In 
addition 
to 
discussing 

Pollack’s replacement, Schlissel 
also discussed the University’s 
response to the election of Donald 
Trump, 
which 
has 
spurred 

multiple campus protests and 
vigils. 

“I think it’s important for a 

leader of a great university not 
to become a partisan politician, 
but it is important that I really 
feel responsible for speaking up 
for our communal values as an 
institution and diversity, equity 
and inclusion are essential,” 
Schlissel said.

Schlissel also discussed the 

number of assaults that have 
occurred since the election in 
Ann Arbor and on the University 
campus.

“We all have identities and 

I think for many people those 

identities feel under threat, 
and unfortunately sometimes 
that threat is strongly verbal 
and we even have a number of 
these threats being physical — 
of assaults, actually, based, we 
think, on race and ethnicity,” he 
said.

He 
also 
noted 
he 
has 

co-signed a letter along with 
other leadership, in support of 
students benefitting from the 
Deferred Action for Childhood 
Arrivals executive order. The 
program, first established via an 
executive order under President 
Barack Obama, promising not to 
take legal action against childen 
who 
illegally 
entered 
the 

country before they turned 16, 
and gives them the opportunity 
to receive a Social Security 
number.

“To our country’s leaders we 

say that DACA should be upheld, 
continued and expanded,” the 
letter reads. “We are prepared 
to meet with you to present 
our case. This is both a moral 
imperative 
and 
a 
national 

necessity. America needs talent 
— and these students, who have 
been raised and educated in 
the United States, are already a 
part of our national community. 
They 
represent 
what’s 
best 

about America, and as scholars 
and leaders they are essential to 
our future.”

Moving forward, Schlissel 

stated that the University will 
use legal action, if necessary, to 
protect DACA students. 

The Senate Assembly also 

discussed recent developments 
with the tri-campus task force. 
Discussions 
surrounding 
the 

task force have been ongoing 
since 
the 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee 
on 
University 

Affairs first meeting, during 
which 
representatives 
from 

UM-Flint 
and 
UM-Dearborn 

were invited to speak on cross-
campus miscommunication and 
issues.

inning 
and 
losing 

is the essence of 
politics, and losing 

badly is exactly what happened 
to Democrats across the country 
on Nov. 8. As Democrats, the 
losses we suffered all the way 
down the ballot on Election Day 
would have been disappointing 
at a minimum, even if some other 
run-of-the-mill 
Conservative 

was at the top of the Republican 
ticket. 
However, 
given 
the 

sexist, xenophobic, racist and 
bigoted rhetoric of President-
elect Donald Trump’s campaign, 
the outcome was more than 
disappointing 
— 
it 
was 

devastating. In a few months, the 
incoming administration will 
begin to implement policies that 
will have extremely negative 
effects on many individuals 
and communities. But we are 
already seeing this election’s 
impact in the episodes of ethnic 
intimidation and violence on 
our campus, which is not only 
devastating; it’s horrifying.

By now, many — if not all 

— students are aware of the 
#NotMyCampus letter that has 
been circulated by Conservative 
students, 
including 
some 

members of the University of 
Michigan’s chapter of College 
Republicans. In that letter, there 
is 
one 
particular 
statement 

that epitomizes the disconnect 
between 
Conservatives 
on 

campus and the broader campus 
community. The author states: 
“This was an election, nothing 
more, nothing less.” We could 
not disagree more. Yes, this was 
an election. Yes, in every election 
there is a winner and a loser. But 
what we have seen take place in 
the last few days on our campus 
alone should indicate clearly and 
loudly that this was much more.

Hate speech is not politics. 

The dehumanization of women 
and underrepresented minorities 
is not politics. The harassment, 
intimidation 
and 
assault 

of members of our campus 
community 
based 
on 
their 

religion, race or other identities 
is not politics. Conservatives, 
from national elected officials 
to some of our family members 
to some of our classmates, have 
bent over backward to separate 
conventional 
Republican 

ideology from hateful rhetoric 
and small mindedness.

Perhaps, in an effort to see the 

best in people, we want to believe 
them, to trust that it was promises 
regarding 
trade 
or 
national 

security that motivated support 
for someone like Trump. As 
progressives, though, any effort 
to see things from this positive, 
rationalizing 
perspective 
is 

undermined by the inability of 
Conservatives to respect, or even 
try to understand, the processing 
of fear, grief and loss that many 
people on this campus have 
experienced since Election Day.

The fear is not of Republican 

policies, per se, but of walking 
down the street at night in a 
hijab or other religious attire. 
The grief is not over a defeat or 
a death, but grief nonetheless 
that a country we all love, and 
people some of us view as friends 
and neighbors, chose to endorse 
hatred. The loss is not merely in 
the electoral sense, but rather 
in the denial of humanity that 
many marginalized groups and 
individuals view this outcome 
as representing. The election 
of a Republican president is not 
what sparked protests, vigils 
and walkouts. The true root 
of this anger and sadness is 
more complex. It is the jarring 
realization that perhaps the 
ignorance and bigotry that many 
of us were taught to eschew 
as children is the path, not to 
societal reprimand and isolation 
on the backwaters of the internet, 
but to political power. It is the 
crushing 
understanding 
that 

many of our fellow Americans 
made 
the 
ultimately 
selfish 

choice to overlook threats to the 
humanity of so many and instead 
cast their votes on the basis of 
partisanship or a single issue.

We know, however, that this 

outbreak of hate is not the whole 
story. The outpouring of love 
and support for one another 
that the majority of students 
on this campus have displayed 
shows us that this cannot be the 
case. This country, this state 
and this University ought to be 
communities where everyone 
feels safe, and students have 
shown they are ready and 
willing to fight for that to be 
true. We have not lost faith in 
our ability to make change, and 
in the two years leading up to 
the enormously consequential 
election of 2018, we will be there 
working and fighting.

More important, however, is 

what happens right now. We all 
must stand in solidarity with one 
another. We must support those 
fighting for change and those 
seeking to have their voices 
heard within a system that has 
not always listened. We must 
stand up to those who would 
use conservatism as a shield 
for intolerance. We must hold 
elected officials, whether we are 
the ones who helped put them 
in office or not, accountable. We 
must use our immense power 
as people to organize against, 
mobilize against and ultimately 
remove from office those who do 
not represent us, our values or 
the community, communities we 
want to be a part of. We pledge to 
do that to the best of our ability 
and we challenge you to help us 
do that work in any way you can. 
Activism, advocacy and politics 
are difficult callings that come 
with inherent highs and lows. 
No matter where you fall on the 
ideological spectrum, fighting 
for what you believe in is a long 
and constant struggle. It won’t 
be easy. It may not be fun. But 
we pledge to listen openly and 
honestly. Standing together, we 
will do the work and we will 
succeed.

It’s not just politics

It is time to argue for unity

MAX RYSZTAK | ARTICLE TYPE

T

wo weeks after the 
election, 
members 

of 
our 
community 

still feel attacked, reduced 
and unsafe — no matter their 
political 
opinion. 

The days following 
the 
presidential 

election have been 
hard on us all. These 
feelings cannot go 
unnoticed; they are 
justified, regardless 
of political party or 
ideology.

There 
is 
still 

an 
unmeasurable 

animosity 
between 

the 
left 
and 
the 

right, but I truly believe there is 
plenty of room to come together. 
Before this can happen, people 
need to accept the results of 
election 
night. 
Refusing 
to 

accept the results, crying for 
the abolishment of the Electoral 
College and spreading hate 
against our peers, no matter 
who they voted for, hinders our 
community’s ability to unify 
after the election — and both 
sides are at fault.

If you truly want the inclusive 

country many of you argue for, 
it’s time to stop calling Trump 
voters 
sexists, 
misogynists, 

racist and bigots. Whether you 
agree with them or not, they 
are Americans who have a 
right to vote for any candidate. 
Victory, however, doesn’t give 
anybody the justification for 
spreading hate, especially on 
campus. Hate crimes, such as 
violently attacking those of the 
Muslim faith, are completely 
unacceptable. To any Trump 
voters who now feel they have 
the right to express their views 
in inappropriate ways, your 
candidate says “Stop it.”

A 
large 
proportion 
of 

Conservatives 
and 
Trump 

voters are not the racist, sexist, 
homophobic bigots that they are 
made out to be. While it is only 
the miniscule proportion that 
seems to be having the loudest 
voice, most Conservatives are 
bundled with the extremists. 
This campus, supposedly one of 
diversity, makes most of us feel 
uncomfortable 
in 
discussing 

our opinions. This isn’t a short-

term problem — it is systemic 
and long-lasting. We have dealt 
with professors saying it’s OK 
to hate Republicans; we have 
political protests — supported 

by 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan’s 

administration 
— 

fueling hate against 
a 
major 
political 

party and ideology. 
If 
I 
wanted 
to 

wear 
Republican 

apparel to one of 
my 
classes, 
there 

is probably a good 
chance I would be 
verbally or physically 
attacked. That type 

of ideological intolerance should 
not be condoned at a place that 
prides itself on intellectualism 
and diversity, no matter how 
strong the feelings we have for or 
against a certain candidate are.

For those with different 

political beliefs from those 
of Conservatives like myself, 
I understand your anger and 
fear. I get that a lot of what 
President-elect 
Trump 
says 

scares minority communities on 
this campus. Faced with slurs, 
inappropriate 
language 
and 

the talk of threatening policies, 
there has certainly been much 
hate. But if you look past his 
campaign rhetoric, most of the 
actual policies on immigration 
or LGBTQ issues, for example, 
are not radical at all — they 
are actually more moderate 
than what other Conservative 
candidates proposed. I implore 
anyone who is upset at the 
outcome of the election and 
who feels scared for whatever 
reason to read the president-
elect’s policies.

Hashtags 
such 
as 

“#NotMyPresident” 
not 

only 
represent 
denial 
and 

immaturity; 
they 
represent 

intolerance. 
As 
much 
as 

some may disagree with the 
president-elect, 
he 
will 
be 

our president. As Secretary 
Clinton said, “Donald Trump 
is going to be our president. 
We owe him an open mind 
and the chance to lead.” While 
a similar campus movement 
by 
Conservatives 
titled 

“#NotMyCampus” — through 

which right-leaning students 
voiced their objections on the 
University administration’s bias 
against conservative students 
— exists, it is very different. 
Conservatives 
here 
have 

specific complaints about the 
school administration’s actions 
regarding 
political 
beliefs, 

whereas 
“#NotMyPresident” 

supporters are merely reacting 
to a loss by refusing to let go of 
controversial statements by the 
president-elect.

The campus administration 

would 
be 
wise 
to 
heed 

Secretary 
Clinton’s 
words. 

Those on both sides argue 
that campus leaders have a lot 
to do. Whatever solutions the 
University pursues, I hope it 
keeps students of all political 
backgrounds in mind. Those 
of 
all 
faiths, 
backgrounds, 

experiences 
and 
political 

beliefs have the right to be 
heard and the right to express 
their opinions. The problems 
on this campus are not one-
sided — they are widespread 
and deeply rooted. There is a 
current culture among students 
of being afraid to voice their 
opinions, of not accepting each 
other for what they believe 
and feeling their environments 
are hostile. No matter one’s 
political opinion, people of all 
sides don’t feel like they can 
truly speak their minds — and 
the administration needs to 
help in an unbiased way.

Margaret Thatcher once said, 

“I always cheer up immensely 
if an attack is particularly 
wounding because I think, well, 
if they attack one personally, 
it means they have not a single 
political argument left.” As 
we move past the election, 
we should strive to return to 
political debates, not personal 
ones. In an election in which 
both sides sank to the lowest 
levels of political discourse, it 
is up to us to return to policy 
and ideas, not personality and 
labels. We need to forget this 
election, move on from the hate 
and work on ideas.

Taking off the blindfold

I

t’s been a hard two weeks. 
It’s been two weeks on 
a 
long 
and 
extremely 

emotional roller coaster. From 
disbelief to hurt to 
anger to annoyance 
to uncertainty to 
motivation, 
the 

outcome 
of 
the 

2016 
presidential 

election 
had 
me 

feeling 
each 
of 

these to the highest 
degree, 
none 

lasting more than a 
day but each more 
intense than the 
last. 
By 
chance, 

I had planned on going to 
Cincinnati, Ohio, the Thursday 
after the election. What was 
meant to be a lone road trip 
to the place I grew up ended 
up being my first excursion 
in a long time from the liberal 
bubble of Ann Arbor.

I grew up in Cincinnati, born 

and raised in a quintessential 
suburban 
neighborhood 
that 

I am thankful for every day. 
However, unlike myself, most of 
my neighbors and my classmates 
were 
from 
conservative 

families. My earliest experience 
with politics was during the 
2004 
presidential 
election. 

My staunchly liberal parents 
put out John Kerry signs on 
our front lawn, which quickly 
disappeared the next day. When 
this happened, I was sent to one 
of the three liberal families in 
my neighborhood to pick up 
another sign, hoping it would 
last longer than the previous 
one. Similarly, in 2008 and 
2012, our Obama signs stood 

out in a field of McCain and 
Romney ones. By no means was 
Cincinnati as a whole on the 
right side of the spectrum, but 

the suburban and rural 
parts of the city were 
more red than they 
were blue.

As 
I 
grew 
older 

and formed my own 
left-wing 
beliefs, 
I 

always had an uneasy 
feeling when politics 
become the topic of 
conversations. In fact, 
I would try to avoid 
them, 
not 
wanting 

to stand out or be 

one of the few liberal voices 
in the conversation. Yet, these 
conversations happened, and I 
inevitably learned the value of 
understanding the other side, as 
many of its members were my 
closest friends and neighbors.

When I came to the University 

of Michigan, I was in heaven. As 
with many college campuses, the 
liberal energy was infectious. 
Living in an environment where 
the majority of people believed 
what I believed and supported 
many of the same causes I did 
was a refreshing change from 
feeling politically out of place 
in the community in which I 
grew up. Additionally, the fact 
that I was living in the Obama 
era naturally gave me more 
confidence in my liberal beliefs. 
It made it easier to bear the 
conservative majority in my 
Cincinnati suburb, and fully 
embrace the comfort of a liberal 
Ann Arbor. No longer did I feel 
like a political minority, but 
rather a part of the majority. 

No 
longer 
did 
I 
approach 

political 
conversations 
with 

apprehension but instead with 
excitement. I had an eagerness 
to talk to classmates who had 
similar beliefs, classmates I 
expected to have similar beliefs.

The four hours traveling 

back home were four hours 
of thinking to myself: how? 
How could America elect a 
completely unqualified man to 
the most powerful job in the 
world? Ironically, my drive 
down I-75 was a drive through 
Trump land, through the middle 
area of Ohio where Mr. Trump 
garnered much of his support. I 
passed numerous Trump signs 
that had not yet been taken 
down, from small ones I had 
to squint to see to huge ones 
that were impossible to miss. 
I had just left a campus where 
disappointment 
and 
sadness 

were extremely prevalent on 
the faces of students. Yet, the 
farther I got from Ann Arbor, 
passing Trump strongholds I 
had seen colored a deep red on 
the New York Times electoral 
map just days before, the results 
of the election became real. The 
towns I passed and communities 
I drove by radiated victory 
while I felt utter defeat. But I 
still didn’t understand why they 
could support a candidate like 
Trump. Even worse, I realized I 
hadn’t made the effort to.

E

very passing day of this 
election 
cycle 
made 

me feel frozen in place. 

Every day I could tell you some 
crazy thing Trump had said 
or relate some attempt Clinton 
had made to seem normal, but 
I couldn’t garner the energy to 
volunteer or get involved in any 
way. While many chalked up this 
fatigue to historically unpopular 
candidates, I’ve chalked it up 
to a more fundamental change 
in the 2016 climate: an inability 
to actually affect voters with 
facts. My whole civic education 
has been based upon the notion 
that our civic system is based on 
rational, 
fact-oriented 
debate. 

Maybe this was naive to believe 
from the beginning, but this 
election cycle has proven the 
notion entirely irrelevant.

2016 will be regarded as the 

year fact finally died. The Oxford 
Dictionary has made it official, 
declaring “post-truth” as the 2016 
Word of the Year. However, truth 
has clearly been on its deathbed 
for a while now. Eleven years ago, 
during the first episode of “The 
Colbert Report,” Stephen Colbert 
introduced the world to the 
concept of truthiness, defined by 
him as “the belief in what you feel 
to be true, rather than what the 
facts support.” At the time, it was 
a joke on how maybe the reasons 
for invading Iraq were in Bush’s 
heart, among other issues, but it 
rings eerily true in today’s politics.

Lying isn’t new to United 

States politics — it’s why we have 
newspapers and fact-checking 
organizations to hold politicians 
accountable. 
But 
the 
sheer 

scale of President-elect Donald 
Trump’s lies has changed politics 

for the worse. PolitiFact rated 
70 percent of the statements 
it evaluated from Trump as 
having some degree of falsehood. 
Politico evaluated every one of 
Trump’s and Clinton’s statements 
over a week-long period of the 
campaign, and found that Trump 
said 87 falsehoods in five days, or 
one lie every three minutes and 15 
seconds of public speaking that 
week. In comparison, Clinton 
said eight lies over the same 
period. It’s clear that those who 
tilted the scales for Trump didn’t 
do so because of his penchant for 
truth or morality, but if voters 
were unfazed by lies, what will 
convince them?

This 
problem 
lies 
deeper 

than just a single candidate. 
A BuzzFeed analysis showed 
that in the last three months 
of the campaign, stories on 
fake news sites generated more 
Facebook 
engagement 
than 

stories from real, reputable news 
organizations. This fake news 
transcended 
candidates 
and 

even parties. Another BuzzFeed 
analysis from last month showed 
that 
popular 
hyper-partisan 

Facebook 
pages 
from 
both 

liberals and conservatives had 
alarming rates of falsehoods.

In the aftermath of this 

election, many on these pages 
have 
discussed 
what 
must 

happen 
for 
Democrats 
to 

reclaim Congress and the White 
House, including developing an 
economic message more suitable 
for Rust Belt worries. But none of 
that matters if politics has turned 
into a race about who can lie their 
way out of more situations. A 
new trade policy that will greatly 
benefit Michigan’s auto workers 

won’t mean a thing if news stories 
about it appear in news feeds 
alongside fake news articles 
claiming that globalist liberals 
want to send all jobs to Canada.

This is an issue that should 

deeply trouble anyone who cares 
about electing leaders based on 
facts and policies rather than 
rhetoric and personal insults — 
not just liberals trying to change 
the leaning of our leaders. To 
their credit, Facebook and Google 
have 
recognized 
the 
issue, 

but it will take more than just 
media companies to correct it. 
It will take leaders on both sides 
of the aisle to rebuild trust in 
mainstream news sources instead 
of attacking them.

On election night, while the 

news of a Trump presidency 
caught me by surprise, it wasn’t 
something I wasn’t ready for. Polls 
consistently showed him within 
a margin of error of beating 
Clinton. FiveThirtyEight’s final 
forecast gave Trump a 28.6 
percent 
chance 
of 
winning, 

roughly the chance of flipping 
two coins and having them land 
on the same side.

Democratic 
congressional 

leaders, on the other hand, didn’t 
have a plan for what to do given 
a Trump victory. This remarkable 
ignorance of the facts shaping 
our world should be a wake-up 
call for all, indicating that we 
need to get outside our bubbles 
of information and engage with 
tough realities. It won’t be as easy 
as reading a personally generated 
list of stories, but when has 
democracy ever been easy?

WARNER BROS.

When boys try to mansplain the time turner to me.

“Fantastic Beasts and Where 

to Find Them” is the much 
anticipated prequel to the Harry 
Potter 
series, 

centered on the 
adventures of the 
renowned author 
Newt Scamander 
(Eddie Redmayne, 
“The Danish Girl”) 
in his writing of the 
titular 
textbook 

read by Harry and 
the crew. It would 
be easy to gush 
about the Harry 
Potter 
universe 

and the role of this film in setting 
the groundwork for the future 
generation, especially in regards 
to Grindewald’s rise to power and 
the foundation of modern magical 
education. However, while fun and 
creatively impressive, the film’s 
failing in character depth reveals 
deeper issues of the film industry’s 
reliance on digital effects and 
the 
problematic 
paradox 
of 

ornamental diversity.

One of the most anticipated 

elements of the film is its reveal of 
the wizarding world in America. 
Set in post-WWII New York City, 
the film integrates magical society 
with the non-magical in the 
traditional Harry Potter fashion. 
The bulk of this work is focused 
on the Magical Congress of the 
United States, a Ministry-esque 
government hub complete with 
flying paper airplanes, magical 
lifts and an infinite skyrise of 
offices. “Fantastic Beasts” fails 
to deliver a world as complex and 

fascinating as the original, but this 
is understandable given its limited 
duration and the fact that it’s the 
first film of its series. In particular, 
in terms of the complexity and 
breadth of its universe, the film 
lacks that unique nostalgic tie to 

the original series 
and is ultimately 
a faded replica of 
what 
fans 
have 

come to expect.

While 
the 

film 
disappoints 

on 
setting, 
it 

overwhelmingly 
delivers 
in 
its 

exploration of the 
world of magical 
creatures – a world 
that, 
until 
now, 

has barely been skimmed. In one 
pivotal scene, Newt descends into 
his leather briefcase to tend to his 
creatures. In this moment, the film 
tests the creative imagination of its 
viewers; Newt reveals the multiple 
biomes present in his case, each 
inhabited by a diverse spectrum 
of creatures ranging from massive 
to miniscule and unassuming to 
terrifying. The CGI work in this 
scene, while not entirely seamless, 
works effectively to translate 
the imagination of J.K. Rowling 
and the other creative minds in 
constructing an entirely new 
magical facet of this universe not 
seen in the books. This scene does 
the bulk of the work in terms of 
Newt’s character as well, as his 
commitment becomes evident.

However, Newt may be the only 

interesting and complex character 
in the entire film. Across the board, 
every character but the protagonist 
lacks nuance and understandable 
motivations. 
Tina 
(Katherine 

Waterson, “Steve Jobs”) plays the 
American ex-auror who both aids 
and inhibits Newt; she oscillates 
between a sense of duty and a desire 
for adventure, landing somewhere 
in the neutral and boring middle. 
Jacob 
Kowalski 
(Dan 
Fogler, 

“Custody”) 
is 
Scamander’s 

Muggle (the American term is 
No-Maj) sidekick who somehow 
manages to stay un-obliviated and 
is kind of charming but ultimately 
useless. Even the main antagonist, 
Graves 
(Colin 
Farrell, 
“True 

Detective”), lacks the subtlety to 
explain his desire for destructive, 
uncontrollable dark magic.

This overwhelming trend in 

the film reveals the formulaic 
blockbuster reliance of CGI to 
carry the film and subsequently 
sucks the nuance from the film’s 
character depth and development. 
This results in one-dimensional, 
uninteresting 
characters 
who 

don’t work to challenge the 
viewer’s 
critical 
consumption 

experience. This lack of depth 
is particularly salient in the 
context of a modern film industry 
and cultural climate that puts 
emphasis on diversity within the 
cast and crew. The epitome of this 
intersection is seen in the Magical 
Congress’ President, a female 
woman of color who supposedly 
has the most power but is arguably 
the most accessory and useless 
character in the film. Here we 
see the paradox of implementing 
diversity but neglecting depth; 
diversity becomes ornamental and 
problematic in it of itself. While 
“Fantastic Beasts” delivers fans 
the Harry Potter experience on 
the surface, its choices in focus 
reveal larger problematic trends in 
film and culture. 

‘Beasts’ is fun, but fails to 
flesh out new characters

“Fantastic Beasts 
and Where to Find 

Them”

Rave & Quality 16

Warner Bros.

The 
National 
Geographic 

channel 
rarely 
misses 
an 

opportunity to educate the public 
on recent science and research-
related 
findings. 

However, 
the 

behind their newest 
“Mars” miniseries 
are 
interesting, 

but based on a 
tired 
idea. 
For 

a 
channel 
made 

famous for their 
documentaries and 
dramatizations, 
“Mars” 
attempts 

to blend the facts 
behind 
NASA’s 

Mars attempts with the fiction of 
a backstory set in the year 2033. 
However, with fact overtaking 
fiction, where does “Mars” fit into 
the spectrum?

The direction that “Mars” takes 

is unconventional, especially for 
a production on a channel that 
values scientific fact over fictional 
series. Seamlessly blending these 
dueling concepts is a quality often 
sought after in a Hollywood that 
rarely gets it right. However, 
tipping the scale to favor one 
over the other can often produce 
unfavorable results rather than 
intelligent debate. As is often the 
case for a science-based network, 
the scale noticeably tips toward 
reality over fiction. Although 
science in fan favorites like “The 

Martian” or the “Star Wars” 
franchise may not be as genuine 
or experimentally proven as in 
“Mars,” they succeed in plot and 
storytelling, an area in which 
“Mars” needs improvement.

The 
premise 
of 
“Mars” 

entertains the idea of a human 

settlement 
on 

the infamous red 
planet, detailing 
the 
dangers 

and 
struggles 

that comes with 
exploration 
of 

the 
unknown. 

Although 
ambitious, 
“Mars” 
’s 
plot 

noticeably 
lacks 

material of any 
real 
substance. 

Even 
though 
a 
continuous 

B-roll does provide the audience 
a special look into NASA’s 
recent undertakings and cites 
interviews 
with 
program 

directors, the shift between 
fictional 
storytelling 
and 

actual interviews act more as a 
distraction than supplemental 
material.

Though one could look at 

the slow pace of “Mars” as a 
reprieve from the archetypical 
sci-fi space mission, the lack of 
any intercharacter chemistry 
does not bode well for the new 
miniseries. The attention to 
detail is admirable, but without 
any chemistry, the series is likely 
to take a fatal blow to viewership.

When the scenes that take 

place on the planet of the 
series’ namesake finally appear, 
there is a stunning lack of 
quality — as if the budget was 
far surpassed on B-roll alone. 
Though aesthetically pleasing, 
there is an element missing in 
the dramatization section of the 
episode which, if not worked 
on, will certainly spell doom for 
the Daedalus crew. The already 
blurred line between fact and 
fiction exponentially increases 
as 
the 
episode 
progresses, 

taking the concentration of its 
followers out of this world. In 
addition, the running time of 
the episode is punctuated by 
multiple interviews with big 
names, such as Elon Musk of 
the “Space X” project, making 
the series feels broken without 
anything concrete to tie these 
concepts together. If it weren’t 
for Musk’s namesake, one would 
find it difficult to distinguish the 
line between actual and mock 
interviews.

At 
times, 
though, 
the 

interviews fittingly shift between 
the happenings on the shuttle 
to the present because errors 
predicted in 2016 occur during 
the 
Daedalus 
mission. 
But 

interconnectedness is everything 
and “Mars” is most certainly a 
distance away from perfection. 
While it’s certainly ambitious 
of “Mars” to attempt to find 
harmony between a documentary 
and drama series, the meshing 
between the two ultimately fails 
to lift off.

“Mars”

Miniseries Premiere

Mondays at 9 p.m.

National 

Geographic

Sting reopened Paris’s Bataclan 

theater last Saturday — one year 
after the devastating terrorist 
attack there which killed 129 
people — with a 
moving set. Sting 
first entered the 
new wave music 
scene almost 40 
years ago, yet he 
still 
remains 
a 

go-to figure when 
society 
aches 

for 
the 
healing 

powers of music. 
After 
assuring 
an 
emotional 

French crowd that “we won’t 
forget 
them,” 
the 
esteemed 

philanthropist 
performed 
his 

soothing 1987 hit “Fragile” along 
with two tracks from his brand 
new record 57th & 9th.

Clearly, an emotional year 

preceded the release of Sting’s 
twelfth solo album. He opened up 
to NPR about its track “50,000” 
which was inspired by the loss 
of a handful of rock stars this 
year — David Bowie, Prince 
and Glen Ferry to name a few. 
Their sudden deaths led Sting to 
question his own mortality. “We 
all are shocked irrationally when 
they prove to be very mortal … 
I am 65 years old, I imagine I’ve 
lived most of my life already,” he 
reflected.

Sixteen Grammys later, the 

former frontman of The Police has 
led quite the life. 57th & 9th is the 
first record he has released since 
his short-lived, autobiographical 
Broadway show “The Last Ship” 
in 2013. While this album’s 

emphasis on pertinent issues like 
climate change (in “One Fine 
Day”) and the refugee crisis (in 
“Inshallah”), the majority of 57th 
delivers 
a 
less-than-inspiring 

Sting. With occasionally over-
sentimental 
lyrics, 
clunky, 

Broadway-like 
melodies 
and 

an 
overall 
lack 

of 
musical 

cohesiveness, 
Sting’s 
return 
to 

rock 
lacks 
vital 

intrigue.

The record opens 

with the playful, 
rock ‘n’ roll-rooted 
“I 
Can’t 
Stop 

Thinking 
About 

You” — the single admittedly gets 
catchier with repeated listens. 
Sting seems to be channeling some 
mid-life romantic angst here, as 
the chorus drives, “I can’t stop 
thinking about you, I can’t stop 
wanting you this way.” It’s a little 
too reminiscent of early 2000s 
soft rock — specifically the ringing 
guitar riffs and stagnant snare of 
O.A.R.’s “Love and Memories.”

“One Fine Day” and “Pretty 

Young Soldiers” bear stains of 
Sting’s Broadway stint. The former 
is a piano-accented, unconvincing 
call to action on climate change. 
He sings “Dear leaders, please do 
something quick/Time is up, the 
planet’s sick.” It is easy to then 
envision Sting shrugging “But hey, 
we’ll all be grateful/One fine day” 
and ducking off stage behind a red 
curtain. Furthering the theatrics, 
“Pretty Young Soldier” narrates an 
unoriginal military romance story, 
accompanied by worn-out strums 
and tired percussion.

Sting’s style eventually perks 

up and diversifies in the second 

half of the record. “Petrol Head” 
is a gritty, driving rock ‘n’ roll 
track. 
Between 
the 
twangy 

chorus, screeching guitar and 
consistent cymbal smashing, it’s an 
intentionally sloppy, garage-rock 
rodeo.

“Heading South on The Great 

North Road” simmers down into 
an acoustic Celtic-sounding folk 
lullaby. This familiar, worldly 
ripple in Sting’s swelling vocal 
melodies 
and 
instrumentation 

is reminiscent of his far-more-
moving 1993 hit “Fields of Gold.” 
“Heading South” is one of those 
pleasant moments of 57th, but it is 
merely that — pleasant.

The album finally surpasses 

pleasant 
and 
delivers 
both 

instrumental and melodic impact 
with “Inshallah.” The track’s 
Arabic title translates into the 
hopeful phrase “God Willing.” It is 
a return to Sting’s iconic usage of 
Middle Eastern musical modes, a 
sound which he popularized with 
his 1999 radio hit “Desert Rose.” 
The deluxe edition of the record 
includes a deeper, more haunting 
version of “Inshallah” — Sting 
recorded it with Syrian refugees 
in Germany. Somberly singing 
“Sea of worries, sea of fears/In 
our country, only tears,” the artist 
embodies that same palpable 
empathy and attempt at musical 
healing that led to him singing in 
Paris last week.

Aside from these these rare, 

affecting glimmers, inspiration 
is hard to come by in 57th & 9th. 
While it is one of the powerhouse’s 
most unimpressive records to date, 
Sting’s 
unwavering 
dedication 

to the betterment of this often-
troubling world is as inspiring and 
impressive as ever.

“Sting”

57th & 9th

As a kid, Nickelodeon held a 

special place in my heart. Almost 
every night from around second 
to sixth grade, I had a strict, self-
enforced routine where I would 
watch “The Fairly Oddparents” 
at 7 p.m. and “The Adventures of 
Jimmy Neutron” at 7:30 p.m. If I 
was lucky enough, I could sneak 
in an episode of “Spongebob 
Squarepants,” “Danny Phantom,” 
“Avatar: The Last Airbender” or 
whatever Nick show was playing 
at eight before my mom would 
eventually tell me to go to bed.

I’m not sure why I found Nick-

elodeon so alluring and why I 
preferred it over Disney Channel 
and Cartoon Network. I would 
watch television shows on these 
networks too — I absolutely loved 
“That’s So Raven,” “Even Stevens,” 
“Teen Titans” and “Ben 10” — but 
to me, the lineup of Nickelodeon 
shows was in much higher quality 
at the time.

Let’s be honest: I was obsessed, 

practically addicted, to watching 
Nickelodeon. I lived off watching 
re-runs of “Hey Arnold,” “Rocket 
Power,” “The Wild Thornber-
rys,” “Rugrats” and “CatDog.” I 
would watch the network’s low-
key shows too, like the sharp spy 
family comedy “The X’s,” the 
exemplary sci-fi series “My Life As 
a Teenage Robot,” the trippy-as-
hell “Chalkzone” and the ill-fated 
superhero cartoon “El Tigre: The 
Adventures of Manny Rivera.” I 
would even force myself to watch 
the network’s crappier efforts, like 
the absurdly gross “Mr. Meaty” 
and the dumbfounding, poorly 
animated “Tak and the Power of 
Juju.”

But out of everything that Nick-

elodeon offered, one of the great-
est aspects about the network was 
its accessibility to young, fresh-
faced viewers. Watching the Nick-
elodeon Kids’ Choice Awards was 
also a huge thrill for me, despite 
its overt silliness and excessive 
celebrity appearances. One of the 
greatest nights of my young life 
was watching the KCAs in 2006, 
hosted by a still-manic Jack Black. 
My best friend Brandon and I had 
a sleepover that night and watched 
the entire broadcast of the show, 

eating mac ‘n’ cheese and choco-
late chip cookies in between com-
mercial breaks. I don’t remember 
any specific moments from the 
2006 KCAs, but I recall a sense of 
overwhelming happiness washing 
over me throughout that night. I 
wanted so badly to win a trophy in 
the shape of an orange blimp and 
deep down, I still kind of hope to 
someday.

There was just something about 

Nickelodeon that made it stand out 
among the other kids program-
ming networks. In particular, 
“The Fairly Oddparents” and “The 
Adventures of Jimmy Neutron” 
gave me a reason to keep watch-
ing Nickelodeon, with their zany 
plot lines, animation, relatable 
characters, intelligent storytell-
ing and witty humor. I identified 
with Timmy Turner and Jimmy 
Neutron, both of whom were 
social outcasts but possessed 
the care-free innocence that ful-
filled all my childhood fantasies. 
I yearned to have fairy godpar-
ents like Cosmo and Wanda who 
could grant my every wish and to 
live in a place like Retroville and 
invent time machines and rocket 
ships as a hobby. That being said, 
the two have noticeably imperfect 
qualities, which were put on full 
display in the incredible, crimi-
nally underrated crossover trilogy 
“Jimmy Timmy Power Hour.”

Timmy was a whiny, needy 

10-year-old, who would never 
think about the consequences of 
his wishes and how they would 
affect those around him. Jimmy 
was a smug know-it-all, whose 
intellect often overshadowed and 
alienated his best friends, the neu-
rotic Carl Wheezer and the hyper-
active Sheen Estevez. Something I 
always admired about these char-
acters was their ability to learn 
from their mistakes, with Timmy 
following Cosmo and Wanda’s 
guidance to being a more ethical 
human being and Jimmy not let-
ting his ego get the better of him 
when his inventions threatened 
his loved ones. Sure, most episodes 
followed that formula in order 
for Jimmy and Timmy to achieve 
some form of character develop-
ment. But subconsciously, these 
episodes helped shape my own 
understanding of the trials and 
tribulations of life and how to deal 
with challenging situations.

When I entered adolescence, 

I began watching the live-action 
Nick shows like “Zoey 101,” 
“Drake & Josh,” “Unfabulous,” 
“The Naked Brothers Band” and 
“Ned’s Declassified School Sur-
vival Guide.” And as I grew older, 
each of these shows continued to 
provide me with the necessary 
tools for living through one of 
the biggest transitional periods 
in my life. “Ned’s Declassified” 
was especially influential for me, 
preparing me for the hellish black 
hole that was middle school with 
helpful tips about procrastination, 
bullies, failure and homework. All 
the while, it also managed to tell 
a funny, compelling story about 
three best friends navigating 
through the awkwardness of the 
middle school experience.

Looking back on all those 

Nickelodeon shows, I find myself 
feeling strangely nostalgic and 
somewhat sad that the network’s 
plethora of captivating, origi-
nal content no longer resonates 
in its current lineup. Since I last 
watched it in 2010, “Spongebob” 
has downgraded tremendously, 
trading in its hilariously surreal 
sequences and meta overtones for 
episodes that are unfunny, bizarre 
and mean-spirited. “The Fairly 
Oddparents” replaced its iconic 
theme song with a horrid new one 
and introduced two characters 
— Cosmo and Wanda’s child Poof 
and some girl named Chloe — who 
seem to only exist to keep the show 
from going kaputt. “Jimmy Neu-
tron” ended after three remark-
able seasons, but the producers 
created an unnecessary spin-off 
that put Jimmy’s best friend Sheen 
as the protagonist for some reason.

These Nickelodeon shows, in 

addition to other old ones, are now 
immortalized through the post-
modern vortex of memes. New 
animated shows have taken over 
and ever since “iCarly” and “Vic-
torious,” the live-action programs 
have become garish and under-
whelming.

Still, I’m optimistic about the 

prospects of kids television pro-
gramming. Having watched Nick-
elodeon for a number of years, I 
still have hope that someday, a 
young boy or girl will be inspired 
to write about the shows that com-
pleted their childhood.

— 
Audre 
Lorde, 
“Sister 

Outsider: Essays and Speeches”

***

If there is anything that the 

past few weeks have given me, 
it is renewed respect for my 
professors. Maybe it’s because 
I’m taking humanities courses 
— English, history and drama — 
but every professor I have has 
talked about the impossibility of 
separating our identities from 
our existence in classrooms, 
and 
course 
material 
from 

current 
contextualization. 

Every 
professor 
has 

acknowledged the past few 
weeks and the current climate 
range from disheartening to 
dangerous for different people. 
Many have offered information 
about University of Michigan 
resources (which some feel are 
inadequate) as well as their 
own personal support.

In one of my English classes, 

my professor talked about the 
evolution of our understanding 
of “truth” as a concept. Truth 
used to be seen as objective; 
we now know that truth is 
relative. But she argued that 
truth is more than relative — 
it is positional, meaning that 
sometimes 
the 
only 
thing 

separating 
two 
people 
on 

opposite sides of an issue is the 
fact that they are on opposite 
sides.

Hearing that flipped a switch 

in my brain. Over the past 
two weeks, my Facebook and 
Twitter feeds — not to mention 
classroom discussions — have 
been nothing but reactions 
to the election. Most people 
who 
supported 
Democratic 

presidential nominee Hillary 
Clinton, even if only because 
she was better than the other 
options, seem to fall into two 
groups. One group advocates 
empathy, saying that dismissing 
all Trump supporters is not 
going to help solve anything. 
The other group maintains 
that they owe supporters of 
President-elect Donald Trump 
as much respect as they feel 
those supporters gave them 
in giving their votes to a 
misogynistic, xenophobic man 
with a dangerously homophobic 
vice president.

Some 
defend 
Trump 

supporters by saying that not 
all of them are racist and sexist. 
A common rejoinder to this is 
that even if they aren’t racist or 
sexist, they are still supporting 

misogynistic 
and 

xenophobic rhetoric 
and actions. I think 
this is where the 
idea that truth is 
positional comes into 
play. Racism, sexism, 
homophobia — all of 
these are societally 
ingrained in us. But 
not everyone has the 
toolkit that allows 
us to recognize the 
internalization 
of 

these 
constructions. 
This 

toolkit comes from several 
factors: living in a place with 
a 
diverse 
and 
integrated 

population, a good education 
from educators of a variety 
of backgrounds, exposure to 
different perspectives through 
a variety of mediums and a 
support system that will listen 
to you and help you educate 
yourself.

Thinking about this toolkit 

is especially relevant for this 
next week. I’ve seen a lot of my 
peers — especially the people 
who maintain that the rhetoric 
surrounding 
extending 

empathy to Trump supporters 
is unfair and misdirected — on 
Facebook and Twitter talking 
about how they don’t want to 
spend time with conservative 
family members over the next 
few days during the break. This 
is where truth being positional 
is important. The discussion 
surrounding empathy is an 
important one, but it shouldn’t 
be the first. The question that 
all white allies, or male allies, 
or straight allies (hegemonic 
bonus if you’re all three) etc. 
need to ask themselves first 
is what separates them from 
their 
conservative 
family 

members? What separates a 
straight white male ally from a 
Trump supporter in that same 
demographic?

I think that knowledge of 

the toolkit is one of the main 
separations. The kind of Trump 
supporters that most people are 
talking about — although the 
whole narrative that Trump’s 
main demographic was the 
rural white working class is a 
myth, he was overwhelmingly 
voted into office by people 
with higher incomes, but that’s 
another column entirely — don’t 
have access to several tools in 
the kit I’m talking about. One 
of my history professors said 
that what struck her more 
than anything else about this 
election was the rural/urban 
divide, and that’s telling. Living 
in an urban area will almost 
always force you into contact 
with more different kinds of 
people and ideas. There has 
been abundant discourse on 
the resentment of the white 
working 
class 
for 
feeling 

ignored by wealthy coastal 
liberals; some argue that coastal 

intellectual elites need to have 
more empathy for them. After 
all, there’s no rhetoric around 
“allyhood” when we talk about 
the lower or working class. 
There has also been discourse 
that argues white working class 
people in rural areas aren’t as 
exposed to different people and 
perspectives in the way those 
who live in urban areas are. 
Both things are true.

It is not my place as a white 

person to tell people of color 
to have empathy for Trump 
supporters.

At the same time, it is not 

my place as a white person to 
refuse to talk to conservative 
white people who might have 
voted for Trump.

This is true for the same 

reason that it shouldn’t always 
have to be women raising their 
hands in history classes, when 
people are discussing whether 
or not Trump’s policies will 
be “that bad” for women, to 
explain 
that 
regardless 
of 

whether his policies will match 
his rhetoric, his rhetoric itself 
— both public and private — 
reflects a fundamental lack 
of respect for women. It’s 
the same way that members 
of the LGBTQIA community 
shouldn’t have to take a deep 
breath and explain why Mike 
Pence’s moral and monetary 
support of conversion therapy 
for 
gay 
teens 
represents 

emotional torture and a suicide 
risk for teens. Muslim women 
shouldn’t have to be the only 
ones talking about why this can 
make every day feel unsafe.

The whole point of being an 

ally is leveraging the privilege 
you have in one identity (male, 
straight, white) to help amplify 
the voices and the concerns 
of marginalized communities 
you don’t belong to. It is not 
to co-opt the pain of a group 
of people, which it sometimes 
devolves into when I hear 
white allies saying they don’t 
want to talk about issues with 
conservative family members. 
It is not to give yourself a 
voice in an arena in which you 
otherwise wouldn’t have one. 
It is not to receive a stamp of 
approval from the community 
you are trying to support. It is 
to use your voice when it’s safer 
for you to do so than it would 
be for people who inhabit the 
identities with which you are 
standing in solidarity.

One of my English professors 

told us a few days after the 
election that it might sound 
cheesy, but we all have to take 
care of each other out there. I 
think that this — keeping in 
mind what it really means to be 
an ally, and trying to spread the 
tools in that toolkit as far and 
wide as we can — is the one of 
the only ways we’re going to be 
able to do it.

ALBUM REVIEW

It has been five years since 

Tyler, 
the 
Creator 
famously 

threatened to “stab Bruno Mars 
in his god damn esophagus,” 
catapulting 
himself 
toward 

celebrity 
status 

and labeling the 
starry-eyed singer 
as an enemy of 
the 
internet’s 

subcultural 
angst. Mars was 
an 
ideal 
target 

for Tyler’s anti-
establishment 
rhetoric back then: 
a clean-cut songwriter and music 
industry insider who walked into 
the spotlight with a catchy hook 
and a string of radio hits. He sang 
tongue-in-cheek love songs to 
win mothers’ hearts everywhere 
— eventually claiming enough of 
them to headline the Super Bowl 
— but his lyrics felt more like parts 
of a grand, romantic shtick than 
genuine 
emotional 
offerings. 

Bruno Mars was another one of 
those pop acts that “hip” people 
loved to hate. Talented? Yes. 
Successful? Absolutely. But it 
seemed impossible for him to be 
cool.

Fortunately, 
Bruno 
Mars’ 

latest album, 24K Magic, which 
released on Friday, Nov. 18th, is 
unrecognizable in almost every 
way from his hearty, Radio-
Disney-aimed debut, “Doo Wops 
& Hooligans.” On “Doo Wops,” 
he used soulful affirmations like, 
“You’re amazing just the way 
you are” and “I think I want to 
marry you” to frame his pop 
persona as caring, considerate 
and, above all else, approvable, 
but 24K Magic is more fit to 
score a cocaine bender than 
an innocent first date. Bruno 
bursts out into shouts over thick, 
feverish strumming and hard-
hitting 
percussion, 
strutting 

across groovy synthesizers for 

sport and boasting like a true 
Atlantic City gangster to further 
construct his 1980s-nightclub 
persona.

At just nine tracks long, 

24K Magic almost never stops 
bouncing, its excited vibrations 
seeping 
through 
headphones 

and blaring out of speakers as a 

personal 
assault 

on 
all 
those 

standing 
still. 

On the first song, 
which is also the 
title-track, Bruno 
declares,”Pop! 
Pop! 
It’s 

showtime!” as if 
to warn old fans 
that 
something 

different is underway. Then, 
on “Chunky,” he walks across 
one of the thickest, funkiest 
bass lines in recent memory, 
announcing on the hook: “If you 
ain’t here to party, take your ass 
back home. “Perm” is defined 
by frantic strumming, blaring 
brass 
and 
James-Brown-like 

energy, 
while 
“Finesse,” 
a 

second-half standout, is a coolly 
executed experiment within the 
‘90s boy-band soundscape.

Perhaps Bruno’s transition 

from 
swooning 
lovebird 
to 

hyper-masculine 
fun 
fiend 

was 
somewhat 
predictable: 

his 
second 
album, 
2013’s 

Unorthodox Jukebox, indulged 
in a diverse set of styles while 
last 
year’s 
enormous 
hit 

“Uptown Funk” — produced 
by Mark Ronson — teased his 
tapping into boogey-down eras. 
Still, aggressive demands like, 
“If I ring don’t let it ring too 
long,” which appears on the 
purring, slow song, “Calling All 
My Lovelies,” seem strikingly 
out of character for a man 
who once promised to “catch 
a grenade” for his loved one. 
This attitude change is a good 
thing though, as it adds a layer 
of 
spice 
without 
intruding 

on Bruno Mars’s seemingly 
trademarked soft side. “That’s 

White I Like” achieves perfect 
synergy with his two tones, but 
album-closer “Too Good To Say 
Goodbye” lets the lovebird take 
the microphone.

It’s 
impossible 
not 
to 

compare 24K Magic to Michael 
Jackson’s 
classically 
groovy 

album Off The Wall, especially 
when considering that MJ’s 
longtime musical director, Greg 
Phillinganes, delivered a synth 
solo for the new album’s most 
intimate offering, “Versace on 
the Floor.” Bruno Mars was 
so obviously inspired by Off 
The Wall’s exuberance and 
structure, its clean, brief length 
and unswerving focus on quick-
footed fun, its ability to squeeze 
bubblegum teen-pleasers like 
“Girlfriend” and “It’s the Falling 
in Love” into an otherwise disc-
jockey-ready track-list. There’s 
influence from every swag-
having, heterosexual pop star 
in history stamped somewhere 
on 24K Magic, but Bruno Mars 
seems most intent on chasing 
Jackson’s 
legacy, 
probably 

because it is one of the few lanes 
diverse enough to host all of his 
shapes. It will be fun to watch 
what he evolves into next.

In the meantime, though, 24K 

Magic is sure to shock the world 
with its rhythmic precision 
and timeless sounds. Bruno 
Mars has created a project that 
should prove capable of moving 
parents, 
twenty-somethings 

and teenagers alike, one of 
those ultra rare pop records 
that is painfully fun to listen to, 
one that is both masculine and 
caring, indulgent and emotional, 
but not too much of either. 
Remember “Get Lucky” Or 
“SexyBack?” There is no greater 
phenomenon than pop music 
being good — not carefully-
constructed or well-marketed, 
but actually fun, creative and 
exciting. Bruno Mars is trying 
to usher us into a new golden era 
of pop. I’m sure as hell rooting 
for him to pull it off.

grooves with modernity

W 20-10 (10-1)

Kalis, Magnuson looking to realize dreams

Michigan offensive linemen 

Erik 
Magnuson 
are 
hoping 

they can fulfill a longtime goal 
Saturday, but first, they checked 
off a much smaller one.

Monday at the Wolverines’ 

weekly 
media 
availability, 

Magnuson and Kalis took their 
seats alongside senior tight end 
Jake Butt and fifth-year senior 
defensive end Chris Wormley for 
a press conference in the Crisler 
Center media room. Typically, 
the players at the podium then 
break out from there and answer 
questions individually.

Not Magnuson and Kalis. 

The 
two 
fifth-year 
seniors, 

roommates and good friends 
stood together on one side of the 
media room to answer questions 
as a tandem.

“We’ve been waiting for this 

moment our whole entire lives,” 
Magnuson said with a smile.

A week after playing their 

final game at Michigan Stadium, 
they will travel to Columbus this 
weekend for a showdown against 
the 
second-ranked 
Buckeyes 

on Saturday. If No. 3 Michigan 
wins, it will advance to the Big 
Ten Championship the following 
week.

Under 
head 
coach 
Jim 

Harbaugh, the Wolverines have 
tried to avoid placing more 
importance on one game than 
another, treating them all as 
championships. But with the 
stakes as high as they are this 
week, that’s no longer the feeling.

“Does it feel differently? It’s 

No. 2 versus No. 3!” Magnuson 
said. “We’ve never been in this 
position before. This is unreal!”

As Kalis said during the 

podium 
session, 
Michigan 

suffered through the “downs,” 
and now it is enjoying the “ups.” 
There have been plenty of both.

Three years ago, Kalis and 

Magnuson were the redshirt 

freshmen most often thrown 
into action on a young offensive 
line. Their unit took the bulk 
of the criticism for a 7-6 season 
in 2013 and a 5-7 finish in 2014, 
and it took half of their careers 
before they emerged from that 
shadow.

That did not come up often 

during Kalis and Magnuson’s 
impromptu 
joint 
presser 

Monday. Instead, the two talked 
of the good times that followed, 
the 
trip 
to 
Columbus 
this 

weekend and the ends of their 
wild careers.

Last week, for example, they 

spoke with each other about 
playing their last home game 
Saturday 
against 
Indiana. 

Magnuson is from Carlsbad, 
Calif., a city on the Pacific coast 

between San Diego and Los 
Angeles. His hometown weather 
does not mix well with Michigan 
winters (though, in a photo with 
the Paul Bunyan Trophy after 
the Wolverines beat Michigan 
State last month, he looked more 
like a lumberjack than a surfer).

After 
committing 
to 

Michigan, 
Magnuson 
always 

dreamed of playing in the snow, 
but he never had the chance 
until Saturday at the Big House, 
where the season’s first snowfall 
covered the field and decorated 
the Wolverines’ home finale.

“I 
mean, 
come 
on, 
how 

romantic was that?” he said. 
“It was snowing, the snow was 
just perfect, the field was white, 
the crowd’s yelling ‘Beat Ohio.’ 
We’re sitting there puffing our 

chests out, just like, ‘Man, we 
run this place.’ Pretty cool.”

Those kinds of memories 

have come together nicely as 
Magnuson and Kalis close their 
careers. Those, the two said, 
are the ones that will stick out 
when they look back on the time 
they’ve spent at Michigan.

“It was definitely something,” 

Kalis said. “Fifty years from 
now, if we’re both still kicking 
it, drinking our sweet tea and 
probably talking about that kind 
of game.”

And the win? “That’ll be the 

second thing we talk about (over) 
our sweet tea.”

For now, Kalis and Magnuson 

have one more big test on the 
schedule, though as always, 
they’ll choose to keep things 

loose around Schembechler Hall 
this week. Earlier this month, 
freshman offensive lineman Ben 
Bredeson called them two of the 
funniest people he’d ever met, 
always quick to lighten the mood 
in any setting.

That includes team meetings, 

practices 
and 
even 
press 

conferences, which they finally 
convinced the media relations 
staff to allow them to do together 
Monday.

“They never let us because 

they think we’ll mess around 
too much, so this is like a 
dream come true in the week 
of maybe another dream come 
true,” Magnuson said. “And last 
weekend, another dream came 
true, Senior Day. Come on, it’s 
about the dreams coming true!”

Fifth-year senior offensive lineman Kyle Kalis will play Ohio State for the final time Saturday, in the highest-stakes game of his Michigan career.

JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Writer

‘The Game’ supersedes borders for OSU, ‘M’

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 

took the podium on Monday of 
“Hate Week” and insisted that he 
treats every game the same way, 
despite embracing and enjoying 
the Ohio State rivalry at the same 
time.

The Michigan football players 

who would address the media 
next spoke a little more freely. 
Four of the six hail from the state 
of Ohio, and for three of them, 
this would be their last crack at 
beating the Buckeyes.

The game on Saturday is 

important to them. Add in 
the fact that it would give 
Michigan a berth in the Big 
Ten Championship Game in 
Indianapolis (a feat that hasn’t 

occurred since its inception in 
2011), which alone would be 
enough for the team to approach 
this week with a greater sense of 
urgency.

But the state line often casts 

enough drama the week of “The 
Game.”

The 
Ohio 
State-Michigan 

border has caused confusion in 
the football faithful for years. 
Players raised in one state will 
take their talents to the other, 
and the predicament is a common 
problem on both sides of the 
rivalry. The Buckeyes’ leading 
running back, Mike Weber, is 
a Detroit native and Cass Tech 
graduate. On the flip side, senior 
running back De’Veon Smith 
leads the Wolverines in rushing 
yards and is from Warren, Ohio.

Even Harbaugh’s roots are in 

Ohio. He was born in Perrysburg, 
just outside of Toledo, in the 
same hospital as Ohio State 
coach Urban Meyer. Harbaugh 
confirmed that the two have 
talked about it. It provides 
another similarity between the 
two successful Big Ten coaches.

“We lived there for about a 

year of my life, but I’ve always just 
taken great pride in being from 
Toledo, being from Perrysburg,” 
Harbaugh said. “It’s where you 
were born. ‘Hey, where were 
you born?’ I was born in Toledo, 
Ohio. … My dad was a high school 
football coach at Perrysburg High 
School, and he’s coached at all 
those spots that I just mentioned. 
He was always for his team and 
take pride in being from there. I 
have commonality with people 
that are from there. That’s 

something that has always given 
us joy.”

The ties between the two 

schools blur state lines and 
become points of pride. Fifth-
year senior defensive lineman 
Chris Wormley is also from 
Toledo. He was recruited by 
both Ohio State and Michigan, 
but ultimately committed to the 
Wolverines after growing up a 
fan just five miles south of the 
Michigan border.

Wormley, a co-captain of the 

Wolverines, logged a career-
high 
seven 
tackles 
against 

the Buckeyes last season. He 
attributed part of his dominance 
in that game to being born into 
the middle of the rivalry.

“Coach Harbaugh and I have 

a lot of football talks, but maybe 
sometime this week we’ll talk 

about being from Toledo, and 
what it means being right in 
the middle of Ann Arbor and 
Columbus,” Wormley said. “It’s 
something that, growing up, 
you watch, you have Michigan-
Ohio State parties, you dress up 
for school in your favorite team 
colors. So it’s something that’s 
been with me for a while.”

If you travel south from 

Toledo, you’ll eventually land 
in Trotwood, a city just 80 
miles west of Columbus and the 
hometown of redshirt junior 
Mike McCray.

It would be an understatement 

to say that McCray is a little more 
connected to the rivalry than 
some of his teammates. His father, 
Mike McCray Sr., was a linebacker 
and captain at Ohio State, but 
McCray Sr. hasn’t allowed it to 
affect his relationship with his 
son. Despite his playing days in 
scarlet and gray, he’ll be rooting 
on his namesake this Saturday.

McCray’s 
family 
isn’t 
the 

only one suffering from a mixed 
identity. Senior tight end Jake 
Butt, 
Wormley’s 
co-captain, 

mentioned that his family would 
likely be dealing with a bit of 
“trash talking” this week. Butt 
is from Pickerington, which is 
situated just 20 miles east of Ohio 
Stadium. He even remembers 
growing up a Buckeyes fan and 
cheering on No. 1 Ohio State in 
its 2006 matchup with No. 2 
Michigan with his friends.

Things 
have 
changed 
for 

Butt since then. This week, 
he’ll be trying to get his hands 
on any extra tickets he can for 
friends and family from Ohio. 
Understandably, tickets are hard 
to come by among the Wolverines, 
and even teammates slightly 
more detached from the matchup 
won’t part with them easily. 
Thanks to geography, they know 
what the rivalry means, and they 
have more leverage because of it.

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Fifth-year senior defensive lineman Chris Wormley (#43) is one of many native Ohioans on the Michigan roster for this Saturday’s game in Columbus.

Big Ten roundup

With just over a week of college 

basketball in the books, the season 
is already shaping up to be a good 
one.

Granted, 
the 
level 
of 

competition across the board has 
not been even, but so far, the Big 
Ten is still an impressive 42-9. 

No. 25 Michigan is probably 

in the top half of that spectrum 
after beating Marquette and 
Southern Methodist last week 
in New York City to win the 2K 
Classic.

While it’s still early, things are 

shaping up to be very interesting 
when conference play starts, and 
with that, the Daily breaks down 
the Wolverines’ upper echelon of 
competition when Big Ten play 
rolls around.

No. 3 Indiana (3-0)

Tom Crean’s squad is off to 

a fast start after topping then-
third-ranked 
Kansas, 
103-99, 

in Honolulu during the Armed 
Forces Classic. The Hoosiers 
trailed at halftime before surging 
back to tie the game and force an 
extra period. In overtime, Indiana 
pulled away for its first signature 
win of the season.

Guard James Blackmon Jr., 

who missed all of Big Ten play 
last season with a knee injury, 
has played like he has something 
to prove. He has averaged a 
whopping 23 points per game as 
well as 7.3 rebounds per game in 
Indiana’s first three games of the 
season.

Three other players in the 

Hoosiers’ 
starting 
lineup 
— 

center Thomas Bryant, guard 
Robert Johnson and forward OG 
Anunoby — are all also averaging 
10-plus points per game.

Indiana will have one more 

massive test — a home game 
against No. 4 North Carolina in 
the Big Ten/ACC Challenge on 
Nov. 30 — before starting Big Ten 
play.

No. 16 Wisconsin (2-1)

After 
losing 
at 
No. 
12 

Creighton, 79-67, the Big Ten 
media’s preseason pick to win 
the conference rebounded two 
nights later with an 18-point win 
over Chicago State and a 74-62 
win over Tennessee in Hawaii 
in the first round of the Maui 
Invitational.

The 
Badgers 
will 
play 

Georgetown next with a potential 
matchup against the Tar Heels in 
the championship game.

Guard Bronson Koening has led 

the way, averaging 17 points per 
game, while Big Ten Preseason 
Player of the Year forward Nigel 
Hayes has averaged 12.5 points 
per game.

Forward Ethan Happ has 

averaged eight rebounds a game 
to lead the Badgers on the glass.

No. 17 Purdue (2-1):

The Boilermakers head into 

the week preparing for a trip to 
Mexico to play in the Cancun 
Challenge. But a week ago, Matt 
Painter’s team had a chance to 
snag its first signature win of the 
season against No. 3 Villanova.

But Purdue couldn’t pull off the 

victory, falling just short, 79-76.

While the Boilermakers were 

projected to lean heavily on their 
big men inside — Caleb Swanigan 
and center Isaac Haas lead the 
team averaging 20.7 and 18.3 
points, respectively — guard Vince 
Edwards has also impressed early 
on.

Purdue is slated to play at No. 

10 Louisville in the Big Ten/ACC 
Challenge before it starts Big Ten 
play.

No. 24 Michigan State (2-2)

Michigan State started off its 

season with a heartbreaking loss 
in the Armed Forces Classic to 
Arizona, in which it gave up the 
winning bucket with just two 
seconds left in the game to seal the 
65-63 loss.

A week later, the Spartans 

traveled to New York City, 
where they faced off against No. 
1 Kentucky in the Champions 
Classic. Michigan State struggled 
to generate offense, shooting just 
38 percent to lose to the Wildcats, 
69-48.

The Spartans, led by a highly 

touted recruiting class which 
includes three five-star recruits 
in guards Miles Bridges, Cassius 
Winston and Joshua Langford 
and a four-star recruit in forward 
Nick Ward, were expected to 
contend from the get-go, but 
recent results have caused some 
doubt.

Sunday night, Michigan State 

eked out a one-point victory 
over Florida Gulf Coast that was 
marred by a clock error at the end 
of the game.

The Spartans travel to the 

Bahamas this week to play in the 
Battle 4 Atlantis, where a potential 
matchup against Louisville is in 
the books. Michigan State will 
also play at No. 6 Duke in the Big 
Ten/ACC Challenge.

Maryland (4-0)

The Terrapins’ non-conference 

schedule was highlighted by 
a matchup at Georgetown in 
their second game of the season. 
Maryland overcame a seven-
point deficit in the final minute of 
the game to narrowly win, 76-75, 
to open its season.

Mark Turgeon’s team followed 

the win with another victory 
Sunday night against Towson. 
The Terrapins’ biggest question 
going into the season was where 
production would come from 
after a high attrition rate last 
season, but Preseason All-Big 
Ten guard Melo Trimble is still 
around, and he leads the team, 
averaging 19.9 points per game 
so far. 

MEN’S BASKETBALL

MINH DOAN

Wolverines top Western Michigan, 66-40

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team started off its 
game against Western Michigan 
the same way it did the previous 
game against Howard.

The Wolverines (4-0 overall) 

found themselves in an early 
6-0 hole Monday against the 
Broncos, but the ensuing play 
was not nearly as impressive as 
the 109-41 drubbing of the Bison. 
Michigan pulled out a 66-40 
victory, snapping its three-game 
streak of reaching the 100-point 
mark and giving them a tougher 
test heading into the Paradise 
Jam in the Virgin Islands.

While Michigan responded 

to the early deficit with seven 
straight 
points, 
Western 

Michigan (1-3) proved to be its 
toughest 
defensive 
matchup 

through its first four games, 
limiting the Wolverines to just 
12 first-quarter points — the first 
time they have trailed after a 
quarter this season. The Broncos 
consistently 
double-teamed 

sophomore center Hallie Thome 
down low, and Michigan was 
able to get off just eight shots the 
entire quarter.

“We knew we were playing 

better 
competition, 
so 
we 

expected Western (Michigan) to 
come out very hard, very tough,” 
said senior point guard Siera 
Thompson. “We came out slow, 
but we picked it up in the second 
half. As a team we need to come 
out more prepared.”

The teams traded baskets for 

much of the second quarter, but a 
Kayla Robbins layup as the clock 
expired gave Michigan a 26-24 
advantage at the half. Despite 
the lead, it was still a half that 
Michigan would surely like to 
have back.

After recording a season high 

of 16 turnovers in its previous 
game, Michigan totaled 17 in 
the first half alone, and 24 total.

“(Western Michigan) is a tough 

team,” said Michigan coach Kim 

Barnes Arico. “They forced us 
into a lot of turnovers. They had 
a great game plan. Western did 
a great job of forcing their low 
point guard to go and double our 
kids, tip balls, get deflections or 
take the ball out of our hands. We 
need to get better at that and show 
toughness.”

Thompson — who played the 

game’s first 27 minutes — kept 
Michigan afloat in the first 
half, scoring 11 of her team’s 26 
points. Thompson also kicked 
off the second half with her 
third 3-pointer of the game to 
spark an 8-0 run.

Michigan’s 
third 
quarter 

looked much like its previous 
three 
games, 
outscoring 

the Broncos, 23-9, and only 

coughing up the ball twice to 
pull ahead, 46-33. Robbins, who 
has usually only played during 
garbage time, stepped up when 
the game was close in the third 
quarter, recording four points 
and five boards.

“(Robbins) played a lot in 

other games but to have a 
tight game and see a freshman 
come in and make the positive 
impact that she did tonight 
was definitely something we’re 
excited to see,” Thome said. 
“Having her be able to get those 
rebounds and get those extra 
points is definitely a big deal for 
us.”

With 
a 
comfortable 
lead 

heading into the final quarter, 
the Wolverines were able to pull 

away even further and hold a 
worn out Western Michigan to 
under 10 points for the second 
straight quarter.

Amid 
free 
throw 
and 

turnover 
difficulties, 
the 

Wolverines’ 
defense 
was 
a 

bright spot in the 26-point win. 
The Broncos were limited to 
just a 31.4 shooting percentage, 
and Michigan forced them to 
turn the ball over 22 times.

While Western Michigan was 

the most difficult opponent for 
the Wolverines through their 
first four games, Michigan will 
have to mitigate its ball handling 
miscues if it wants any chance to 
compete against top-25 teams 
Gonzaga and Florida State in the 
Virgin Islands this weekend.

Thompson’s leadership key in win

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team would not have 
beaten Western Michigan by 
26 points without senior guard 
Sierra 
Thompson. 
In 
fact, 

without her 16 points, six assists, 
and four defensive rebounds, it 
probably wouldn’t have won the 
game at all.

As a co-captain and one of two 

seniors on the team, Thompson 
has been an important leader for 
the Wolverines (4-0), but before 
Monday, they hadn’t needed 
her to dominate in games. With 
three wins in three games — 
racking up over 100 points in 
each — Michigan was content 

with spreading out playing time, 
not requiring Thompson to be 
anything more than consistent.

But against a more competitive 

Western Michigan team, things 
changed. The Wolverines looked 
shaky during the first quarter 
after the Broncos were leading 
13-12 and needed Thompson to 
come through on their behalf. 
She delivered, leading the team 
in points.

“She’s 
definitely 
increased 

her leadership role this year,” 
said sophomore forward Hallie 
Thome. “So having her come out 
and have these nights is definitely 
exciting to see, because it’s well 
deserved. All of her hard work 
over these four years is paying 
off.”

Added Michigan coach Kim 

Barnes-Arico: “Sierra Thompson 
was solid throughout … She has 
to always play the other team’s 
best player and she has to handle 
the ball for us. She did a great job. 
She made some plays, she kept us 
in the game in the first half and 
then we were able to rest her for 
a couple minutes in the second 
half.”

In addition to starting every 

quarter, Thompson stayed on 
the court for the entire first 
half of the game, playing two 
full ten-minute quarters. She 
drained three 3-pointers during 
the evening, closing the gap to 
becoming the Wolverines’ all 
time 3-point leader. She is now 
trailing the record by just two.

Thompson had opportunities 

to try and beat that record 
tonight, but she chose to take the 
safer route. On several occasions, 
despite having plenty of time, 
she took a step or two inside 
the three-point arc in order to 
make things easier, instead of 
attempting to pad her personal 
statistics.

“She’s 
so 
experienced,” 

Barnes-Arico said. “She knows 
best shot compared to first shot. 
I think some of our younger kids, 
especially the freshmen, feel like 
the first shot they get is the one 
that has got to go up. (Thompson) 
is experienced enough to know 
that my percentage is going to 
drastically increase the closer I 
get to the basket. So if I can step 
in and make a shot, it’s better 
than me staying where I am and 
missing a shot.”

When she did decide to shoot 

for three, she chose wisely. Her 
3-point field goal percentage was 
50 percent, Michigan’s highest. 
The Wolverine’s leading scorer, 
junior guard Katelynn Flaherty, 
had 18 percent in comparison.

“I think my role on the team 

is to impact the game in any way 
I can,” Thompson said. “I know 
if other people are struggling, I 
can step up and score. I just try to 
do whatever it takes to have our 
team win, and that’s what I had 
to do tonight.”

It may be the first time this 

season that Thompson has filled 
up the box score, but according to 
her coach, she is always making a 
difference.

“I never think we’ll win any 

game without Sierra Thompson,” 
Barnes-Arico said. “I said that 
in my pregame chalk talk to 
our season ticket holders. I said 
‘I know it’s kind of early to be 
thinking about this, but when I 
lay awake sometimes at night, I 
think about her graduating, and 
how much of a void that’s going to 
leave in our program, because of 
what she’s meant to our program 
in the last four years.’ ”
