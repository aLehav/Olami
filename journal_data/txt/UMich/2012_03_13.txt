CITY COUNCIL
Plan
unveiled
to close
three fire
stations
Fire chief says
proposal would
increase efficiency
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily Staff Reporter
At an Ann Arbor City Coun-
cil work session yesterday, Ann
. Arbor Fire Chief Chuck Hubbard
presented a proposal for restruc-
turing the AAFD from its current
five-station model to a three-sta-
tion model.
The plan proposes closing Sta-
tion 3, at 2130 Jackson Avenue,
Station 4, at 2415 Huron Park-
way and Station 6 near Briar-
wood Mall. It would maintain
Station 1, located on Fifth Street
between Huron and Ann Streets
and Station 5, located near the
Northwood housing area and
reopen the formerly closed Sta-
tion 2, at Packard and Stadium
Streets. In the proposed model,
the AAFD would retain its staff of
82 firefighters and redistribute its
trucks and personnel among the
stations, establishing the battal-
ion chief at Station1.
Two trucks carrying four fire-
fighters would respond to each
fire, meeting the federal Occupa-
tional Health and Safety Admin-
istration requirement that four

$10 million gift will
create program for
300 grad students
By HALEY GOLDBERG
Daily News Editor
DETROIT - In front of the
crowd of about 200 business,
government and academic lead-
ers at a Detroit Economic Club
luncheon at the Westin Book
Cadillac Hotel and a live webcast
audience, University President
Mary Sue Coleman and Andrew
Liveris, chairman and execu-
tive officer of The Dow Chemical
Company, announced a new part-
nership between the University
and Dow.
The program, titled the Dow
Sustainability Fellows Program
at U-M, strives to use academic
collaboration to examine and
solve sustainability issues and
offers a unique fellowship for
nearly 300 master's, doctoral
and postdoctoral students from a
variety of academic disciplines at
the University.
In her address, Coleman said
the program will create 300 "new
leaders" from business, engineer-
ing, law, public policy and other
fields. She explained that the

multidisciplinary nature of the
fellowship will allow the program
to efficiently craftsustainable ini-
tiatives.
"The uniqueness of this pro-
gram is that it is not rooted in one
discipline," Coleman said. "It is as
broad and comprehensive as sus-
tainability is itself. And frankly, I
believe it is the only one to solve
the problems as pervasive as the
ones that we are facing in protect-
ing our natural world."
The new fellowship will be
funded with the help of a $10-mil-
lion gift from Dow over a period
of six years. The Midland, Mich.-
based chemical company creates
chemicals and plastics.
Liveris explained that though
Dow has already integrated sus-
tainability ints business, the col-
laboration with the University
and other groups is necessary to
develop efficient and sustainable
strategies that can be implement-
ed worldwide.
"We recognize that no one
industry - and certainly no
one company - can solve these
challenges alone," Liveris said.
"They're too big, they're too glob-
al, and they're too urgent ... Histo-
ry tells us that if we have a chance
at solving anything, then we need
to pull our collective creativity

0 renovations,
Crisler renaming
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily News Editor
At last month's meeting, the
University's Board of Regents
decided to award contracts to
commence the renovation of
East Quad Residence Hall and
improvements to the residential
quarters of the Lawyer's Club.
This week, the regents will vote
on adding another construction
project - a new building for the
School of Nursing - to the list.
In addition to discussing
reconstruction of the School
of Nursing, the board will also
vote on honorary degrees for the
2012 Spring Commencement
ceremony, including recently
announced keynote speaker
Sanjay Gupta - a University
alum CNN's chief medical cor-
respondent They will also vote
on funding increases to renova-
tions to Yost Ice Arena and the
renaming of Crisler Arena.
Timothy Slottow, the Uni-

versity's executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer,
wrote in a communication to
the regents that the new nurs-
ing building will be constructed
to offer space for new meth-
ods of teaching that cannot be
accommodated in the current
building.
"The School of Nursing is
proposing to construct a new
building of approximately
75,000 gross square feet to
accommodate its instructional
space needs, including a clini-
cal learning center with simula-
tion and skill labs and simulated
patient suites in an environment
that will foster collaboration
and community," Slottow wrote.
The University's School of
Nursing was ranked sixth in
the United States last year,
according to U.S. News & World
Reports.
The new building will be
located near the current School
of Nursing building on North
Ingalls Street and is estimated
to cost $50 million, which will
come from the University's
investment proceeds.
PROPOSED RENAMING
OF CRISLER ARENA TO BE
APPROVED

In a communication to the
regents, Slottow and Athletic
Director David Brandon pro-
posed that Crisler Arena be
officially renamed Crisler Cen-
ter.
According to the communi-
cation, Crisler Arena, which
houses the University basket-
ball teams' home courts, was
built in 1967 and was renamed
from the University Events
Building to Crisler Arena in
honor of former Athletic Direc-
tor Herbert Crisler in 1970.
Slottow and Brandon wrote
that the new name would more
accurately describe the build-
ing because of recent improve-
ments and additions to the
space.
The recently constructed
Player Development Center
cost the University $23.2 mil-
lion and offers University
basketball players amenities
such as locker rooms, practice
courts, an equipment room,
and access to medical care.
"Because Crisler Arena is
being expanded and converted
to a more multi-purpose facil-
ity, and the arena portion is
simply one facet of the build-
ing, to refer to it as an arena is

Students support war effort

70 years ago this week
(March 14, 1942): The Wenld Stu-
dent Service Fund organized a
fundraiser across campue to ben-
efit students affected by World
War II. The money collected wan
given to European war priaon-
ers, studenta of Chinene dencent
and immigrants taking refuge in
the United Staten, The Michigan
Daily reported.
Talks were given in Helen
Newberry, Betsy Barbour and
Monher-Jordan Residence Malls,
and pamphlets were distributed
throughout the men's residence
halls to gain support for the drive.
The fundraising effort was an
extension of "Help a War Student
Day," which occurred on March
10,1942.

40 years ago, this week
(March 16, 1972): Police arrested
a University student for arson
after damaging his own room
in the Mary Markley Residence
Hall, as well as four other rooms
and 100 feet of hallway.
Mark Friesen, the student
arsonist and a class of 1975 stu-
dent, "apparently chained the
door from the inside, dropped
a match in a waste-basket, set
the burning waste-basket under
his bed and left the room via a
window which opened onto the
street," accordingcto an article in
the Daily.
Though 14 students were
relocated to other rooms within
Markley, no injuries were sus-
tained.

together."
Coleman said the 300 stu-
dents in the fellowship will
address issues she referred to as
"the wicked problems," mean-
ing the most difficult environ-
mental issues such as energy,
water and land use and human
behavior. Coleman claims that
the program will bring more
sustainability scholars, who are
dedicated to making an impact
in these issues, to campus.
Coleman added that the fel-
lows in the Dow program will
have access to the many sustain-
ability tools that the University
already offers, including the
$1.25-billion University research
portfolio and more than 670 fac-
ulty members with sustainabil-
ity expertise. The program will
also work alongside the already
established Graham Environ-
mental Sustainability Institute,
the Erb Institute for Global Sus-
tainable Enterprise, the Michi-
gan Energy Institute and the
Center for Sustainable Systems
at the University, according to
Coleman.
At a press conference after
the announcement, Don Scavia,
director of the Graham Environ-
mental Sustainability Institute
at the University, explained that
applications for the program will
be accepted next fall, and the fel-
lows will begin in January 2013.
Scavia said the Dow fellow-
ship will provide more graduate
students with the opportunity to
work in fields with an emphasis
in sustainability, since the Gra-
ham Institute's existing doctoral
fellowship program only admits
six students annually.
"(It) is way over subscribed,"
Scavia said of the doctoral fel-
lowship program. "We're only
bringing in six students a year,
and we're getting 70 applications
a year, so we expect a lot of atten-
tion. (The new program) will be
the largest program focused on
sustainability (on campus)."
The master's sustainability
fellow program will last one year
while the doctoral and postdoc-
toral fellows will take two years
ENGINEERING
From Page1
will be the fourth college in the
Big Ten to offer such a program.
Engineering Dean David Mun-
son said he is pleased his college
will launch the program, which
aims to serve the interests of Uni-
versity students and the needs of
society.
"With the growing importance
of sustainability and environ-
mental protection, a greater need
has arisen for degree programs
in environmental engineering,"
Munson said.
Engineering Prof. Terese
Olson led the development of the
program and said it is designed
to allow students to focus their
coursework in the necessary sci-
ences and applied problems that
will prepare them for careers in
the environmental field.
"In the past, undergraduates

interested in environmental engi-
neering were advised to earn a
degree in civil or chemical engi-
neering and obtain a partial focus
in environmental engineering,"
Olson said. "In the new degree,
studeniS take courses in areas of
environmental sciences including
aquatic chemistry, earth science
andeyironmental microbiology
that are not required of civil engi-
nee-s."
Q sjoi said the new program is
multidisciplinary in nature, and
students can take a spectrum of
clashes in engineering and non-
engineering departments, such
asaovironmental earth science,
enviridgsental health science and

to complete.
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily after the event,
Coleman said she is excited to
further develop the relation-
ship between the University and
Dow, noting that the partnership
began several years ago when
Dow assisted the University
in enhancing sustainability on
campus.
"They've been out front as a
corporation doing some really
innovative projects and they've
just become a wonderful part-
ner," Coleman said. "We've been
working with them now for a
number of years, and we think
it's a very good public-private
partnership, and I hope we can
develop more of these."
Though Liveris emphasized
the current sustainable practices
of Dow in his announcement of
the new program, the chemical
company has been connected
with past incidents of environ-
mental harm. According to the
Environmental Protection Agen-
cy web site, the Dow facility in
Michigan has been held respon-
sible for contributing to rising
dioxin levels in the Titabawas-
see River - which flows primar-
ily in the southeastern region of
the state - and its adjacent flood
plains.
However, the company has
recently worked with the EPA to
develop a strategy to clean up the
Midland area.
Dow has also had a long-time
affiliation with the development
of chemicals for warfare, includ-
ing napalm and Agent Orange,
which were used during the
Vietnam War. In response to
these past incidents, Coleman
said she believes Dow and other
corporations have moved toward
a more sustainable model.
"I think all industries in this
country have really been waking
up to environmental responsi-
bility," Coleman said. "It turns
out that Dow has been very
aggressive in this area ... They
recognize at the very top of the
organization and throughout the
organization how important this
is for the future."
In the press conference, Neil
Hawkins, vice president of sus-
tainability and environment,
urban planning.
He added that the program
hopes to create more sustain-
able urban centers and will equip
graduates with the necessary
interdisciplinary background
to manage the resource limita-
tions and environmental impacts
future generations are expected
to face.
Olson emphasized that the
department is confident the
regents and the Presidents Coun-
cil committee will approve the
program.
"The department has a long-
standing, highly ranked envi-
ronmental engineering graduate
program and has for many years
offered environmental engineer-
ing as a focus area within its civil
engineering B.S. major," Olson
said. "The department is in a
strong position, therefore, to offer
this new baccalaureate degree."
Nancy Love, Rackham's asso-

ciate dean of academic programs
and initiatives, said the depart-
ment is excited about address-
ing the strong demand for
environmental engineers, espe-
cially given the overlap between
environmental engineering and
the rapidly growingsustainability
movement.
"There will be a large number
of retirements in the next decade
with significant opportunities for
new hires," Love said. "We are
likely to experience a knowledge.
gap if we don't fill the pipeline of
environmental engineering pro-
fessionals with a new generation
before the major turnover."
According to Love, environ-
mental engineering is listed as

health & safety for Dow, recog-
nized the company's past inci-
dents of environmental harm
and said the company, and its
sustainability practices, have
evolved.
"As Dow grew and expanded,
that's when chemistry and chem-
ical engineering was explored
and practiced for the first time,
so undoubtedly, things did occur
during that time," Hawkins said.
"I think the key thing is we're
very responsibly dealing with
any of those legacies while mak-
ing sure moving forward that
we're practicing the very best
environmental practices."
Mary Kennedy, an MBA stu-
dent in environmental sciences
through the Erb Institute for
Global Sustainable Enterprise,
and Rackham student Laura
Sherman, a current Graham
doctoral fellow, were selected to
answer questions on the panel
alongside Liveris and Coleman at
the event.
In an interview afterward,
Kennedy said she will be eli-
gible for the program and plans
to apply in the fall, adding that
she hopes more students will
appreciate the well-established
sustainability movement at the
University in light of the new fel-
lowship.
"A lot of students don't real-
ize the University of Michigan is
actually a leader in the country
in sustainability, so it's already
something that is attracting top
students and really setting the
University apart," Kennedy said.
"But I think (the Dow program)
is going to make it even stronger
and make this the place to go for
sustainability."
Kennedy added that Dow
heavily recruits from the Ross
School of Business, and the
chemical currently employs over
300 University alums.
"I think we have a good view
of it as a company that is really
trying to make advances (in sus-
tainability), and it is positively
perceived. I see it as a great fit,"
Kennedy said.
The Dow program will be
evaluated regularly throughout
its six years of operation and
will have the opportunity to be
renewed in 2018.
one of the top five professions for
expected global growth over the
next decade.
Engineering Prof. Steve Wright
said he encourages all students
who are keen on environmental-
ism and are technically oriented
to consider environmental engi-
neering.
"There is also a trend in which
there is an increasing number
of departments who are adding
an environmental engineering
degree program," Wright said.
"And I think it's definitely about
time for Michigan."
According to Matt Blank,
undergraduate student services
coordinator for CEE, develop-
ment of the program started a
year and a half ago. Blank said it
wouldn't be difficult for students
to double major in civil engineer-
ing and environmental engi-
neering due to the commonality
between the two programs.
"We'll have more information

closer to May after the degree has
been formally approved."
Engineering senior Nicholas
Darde said he believes the new
degree program could provide a
vast number of career opportuni-
ties for graduates and will allow
students to delve deeper into
courses that will prepare them for
their careers.
"There's environmental con-
sulting that deals with pollut-
ants, renewable energy, emissions
and power plants," Darde said.
"There's a lot that falls under
environmental engineering."
The CEE department will offer
an information session on March
16 for interested students.

said in the release.
With the advent of online

the physical bookstore is no lon-

He noted that the company's

Major said. "Even though our
on-campus stores and our other
divisions performed reasonably
well, our financial performance
as a whole missed our target
due to the performance of our
off-campus stores, which led
us to make some difficult deci-
sions."

University alum Kevin Kielc-

While shopping at a store-
closing sale at Michigan Book
& Supply, students expressed
their mixed feelings about the
store's closing.
"I buy my books online, but
I buy a lot of notebooks and
clothes here," LSA junior Lisa
Usselman said. "I'm not upset
right now because everything
is 75 percent off, but I'm sure
when the store is gone, I'm
going to have a harder time
finding the supplies I need."
LSA senior Brittany Burr
also expressed disappointment
about the loss of options for
shopping near campus.
"I buy most of my books
online, but I come here for all
my art supplies," Burr said.
"There is a place on North Cam-
pus, but it is really far away and
inconvenient."
With the departure of Michi-
gan Book & Supply, Ulrich's
will hold ground as the only
off-campus bookstore, while
Barnes & Noble continues to
maintain an on-campus book-
store in the Union.

Push for public safety
Snyder should call for more police statewide
Republican Gov. Rick Snyder's new public safety plan, which
is slated for the 2013 fiscal year, attempts to reduce crime in
Flint, Detroit, Pontiac and Saginaw - cities with the high-
est crime rates in Michigan. Public safety is an important issue for
any state, and efforts to improve public safety shouldn't be limited
to the most dangerous cities. Michigan lawmakers should increase
funding to other municipalities and local governments that have
been forced to cut important local public safety services.

I'm pretty tough on myself. I make sure I've got it
right. I feel good about what I do.
-Spring commencement speaker Sanjay Gupta, a University
alum told USA Today about his media and medical careers.

Snyder's proposal would add 180 state
police troopers and 20 forensic scientists,
expand drug and mental health courts in
Michigan and re-open the city jail in Flint.
The plan allocates $15 million for two trooper
recruit schools, $5 million for forensics, $1.2
million for drug courts, $2.1 million for mental
health courts and $4.5 million for additional
jail space in Flint.
While the plan is likely to help Flint, Detroit,
Pontiac and Saginaw, other cities in Michigan
also need assistance to reduce crime. Ann
Arbor and the University have felt the nega-
tive effects of fewer police officers. In June
alone, 20 positions in fire and police depart-
mentswere eliminated due to city budget cuts.
Since then, crime alerts from both city and
University police have caused concern in Ann
Arbor. Recently, police issued a warning after
an unusual upswing in home invasions.
Many other cities across the country are
also feelingthe sting of a reduced police pres-
ence. NPR's This American Life reported
that 103 police officers were laid off in Tren-
ton, N.J. in September. From January 2011 to
January 2012, gun assaults in-Trenton rose
76 percent, robberies with a firearm rose 55
percent, car thefts more than doubled and

break-ins more than tripled. New Jersey Gov-
ernor Chris Christie, a Republican, calls these
cuts "the new reality," but when this reality
threatens the residents of many cities across
the country, it's not worth the savings in any
budget. Cities in Michigan shouldn't have to
suffer the same fate as Trenton.
Lawmakers should take several impor-
tant steps to help all municipalities and local
governments in Michigan in their efforts to
reduce crime. For starters, they should enact
Attorney General Bill Schuette's plan, which
calls for 1,000 additional police officers for
the entire state. While state troopers are an
improvement, local police officers are better
acquainted with the areas they serve. Law-
makers should also pass harm reduction mea-
sures to preemptively reduce crime instead of
overfilling our jails and imposing too many
taxes on Michigan residents as a result of an
inflated corrections budget.
Additional police officers can make the
streets in Michigan safer without the assis-
tance of the National Guard or other unnec-
essary forces. While crime reduction in Flint,
Detroit, Pontiac, and Saginaw would be wel-
comed, lawmakers must work to fix the prob-
lem everywhere.

This year's GOP presidential
candidate nominating ses-
sion has elicited a wide range
of reactions from
observers, but
one complaint
shared by most
people is the
length of the
process - it's
gone far too long.
Americans have DAR-WEI
already seen
more than 20 CHEN
debates between
the candidates
and are ready to see one candidate
emerge as the nominee.
On Super Tuesday - the nick-
name for March 6th's 10 primaries
- presumed frontrunner Mitt Rom-
ney was the candidate with the best
chance to take the lead. However,
he wasn't able to deliver the prover-
bial "knockout punch" to eliminate
opponent Rick Santorum, and thus
the lengthy show continues. The lon-
ger the primary process goes on, the
more pandering to the right Romney
has to do in order to gain favor with
the still-powerful Tea Party sect of
the GOP. Since the time before Elec-
tion Day is finite, every day he doesn't
have the nomination sealed is one he
can't spend coming back leftward to
electable positions.
Not only is the extended primary
process allowing President Barack
Obama to take notes on the usually-
moderate Romney's extreme lurches
to the right, it's also going to hurt
Romney's electability in Novem-
ber. Let's look at some of the issues
where Romney has stretched so far
to the right that returning to moder-
ate positions might be difficult, even
with his flip-flopping expertise.
Women's health has been in the
political spotlight for the past few
weeks. In a Fox News interview last
year, Romney told host Mike Hucka-

bee that he would support a consti-
tutional amendment defining the
"beginning of life at conception." Of
course, such an amendment would
outlaw many common forms of birth
control - avicious attackonwomen's
reproductive rights.
If Romney took this "personhood
amendment" stance to the general
election, voters would roundly repu-
diate him across the country. But in
the GOP primary season, he knows
that this far-right position is crucial
to winningthe nomination. Just how
conservative is this position? Look
no further than to what happened
late last year in Mississippi, a state so
conservative that in 2011, 46 percent
of its residents wanted interracial
marriage to be illegal and another 14
percent were unsure about the issue.
When a ballot initiative for the "life
begins at conception" definition was
brought to a vote, more than 55 per-
cent of Mississippians rejected it.
Romney is more conservative than
Mississippi on this issue.
Even when Obama orchestrated
the killing of reviled terrorist Osama
bin Laden last May, Romney couldn't
quite give credit to the president dur-
ing a time of American triumph. He
once told Fox News' Chris Wallace of
the order to take out bin Laden: "Any
president would have done that, but
this one did, and that's a good thing."
Perhaps we should be glad that he's
not conservative or doggedly anti-
Obama enough to criticize Obama
directly, but he had to throw a bone
to right-wing zealots by conceding
only a backhand compliment. Why
couldn't Romney - or the rest of the
GOP for that matter - justgive credit
where it's due?
So Romney is stretching himself
pretty far to the right on those two
issues. Yet Romney might actually be
at his most conservative on the issue
of the auto industry bailouts. After
reports that General Motors posted

record profits in 2011-just two years
after being bailed out by the govern-
ment - Romney still defended his
2008 New York Times opinion piece
"Let Detroit Go Bankrupt" during
debates. He couldn't seem to care
less about the fact that millions of
jobs were saved and an entire eco-
nomic sector was revitalized - the
anti-government faction of his party
beckoned. Remember, Michigan is
Romney's home state, and Romney's
father, George, was a very popular
governor here. But Romney won
the Michigan primary by only three
points over Santorum. His right-
ward stretch almost cost him what
should've been agimme.
Becoming a
moderate again
may be hard.

As long as the primaries drag on,
Romney has to keep stretching to
the right. And like a rubber band, if
he keeps stretching in one direction,
he's going to reach a breaking point
where he can't return to a normal
(read: electable) state. vice President
Joe Biden has been campaigning on
the slogan "bin Laden is dead and
General Motors is alive." The con-
viction-deficient Romney probably
wouldn't have had the courage to
call the bin Laden raid, and he all but
declared that he wanted GM dead.
Attacking women's rights isn't a good
demographics-based strategy either,
to say nothing about policy. Looks
like all this stretching isn't going to
help his presidential run.

The recruiting game

Each year, employers get away with treat-
ing their workers like slaves. Yes, I am talk-
ing about employers in the United States, not
India. The metro Detroit restaurant indus-
try gets away with paying salaries that only
allows around 13 percent of their employees
to make enough money to live. For a single
parent to raise just one child, the estimated
cost of living per year is $36,447 in Wayne
County, yet on average restaurant workers
earn $15,092 a year.
With more than 80,000 food-serving
establishments in the United States, the
annual sales in this industry are more than
$630 billion, with a profit margin of 4.4 per-
cent. Michigan alone make about $12 billion
in restaurant sales each year. To say that
these employers do not have the money to pay
better wages is inexcusable.
One in ten Americans currently work in
the restaurant industry. It has one of the
highest employment rates of any private-
sector industry. Almost 400,000 Michigan-
ders work in this industry. These people
are bound to be our parents, siblings, family
members or close friends. We do not want to
see the people we love work full-time only to
still struggle to pay their mortgage. Improve-
ment is necessary.
The Wages Act and Healthy Families Act
were recently introduced in Congress and
are focused on improving this industry.
The Wages Act will mandate an increase in
tipped employees' minimum wage from a
menial $2.13 per hour to nearly $5 per hour

hour. Considering a normal full-time work
week is about 40 hours, this extra few dollars
an hour could increase an employees' yearly
salary to almost $6,000 a year. That is signifi-
cant step in the right direction.
If enacted, the Healthy Families Act would
require that restaurants with 15 or more
employees grant themeach at least seven paid
sick days per year. Almost every other job
position in the private sector grants a certain
number of paid sick days. In Michigan, only
13 percent of restaurants do this. This would
not only help workers, but patrons to these
establishments as well. Who knows what ill
employee will touch your food because they
were so desperate for money that they came
to work anyway? It's a health risk to allow
this kind of employee treatment.
This is just the tip of the iceberg, but if both
bills pass the industry would become signifi-
cantly more humane. Both bills have yet to be
voted on in the House of Representatives. Be
an advocate and speak out to your representa-
tives in Congress. Or even write a letter.
In the meantime, stick it to the industry
and show them you will not ignore their injus-
tice. Support restaurants that are loyal to their
workers.A few places in Detroit, Michigan that
have been recognized for paying over required
minimum wage and granting paid sick days
are: Avalon Bakery, Colors, Five Guys Burgers
and Fries, Le Petit Zinc, Russell Street Deli,
Slow's BBQ, and Wolfgang Puck's Grille.

By this time every year, many students have secured
an internship for the summer. After applications and
interviews, they've hopefully found what they think is
their dream job. Still, others are continuing the gruel-
ing search, worried they'll be stuck as a camp coun-
selor for yet another summer.
Thankfully, I've figured out my summer plan. But it
hasn't come without stress, worry and hard work. As
a Business student, the recruiting season wasn't for-
eign to me. My older brother graduated from the Ross
School of Business last year, and I had seen him go
through two years of internship recruiting and a year
of full-time job recruiting. Even with that in mind, I
wasn't prepared for the experience. And I realized
something very quickly: The entire thing was a game.
Yes, a game. A game with rules and regulations.
Right off the bat, many people disagree with the
way candidates for a job or internship are initially
screened: through a resume. Judging someone based
on one piece of paper isn't always fair. Someone may
be extremely qualified for a job, but if their resume
doesn't reflect that, they're passed over. Unfortunately,
it's something we must all learn to live with.
Once I had been offered several interviews, the prep
work began - another necessary evil. To me, it seemed
logical that everyone would know a little bit about the
company before heading into a job interview. I real-
ized this isn't always the case. In one case (I won't be
using company names throughout for privacy purpos-
es), I was asked for a basic run-down of their website.
Obviously, I had taken the time to review it, butI was a
little taken aback that I had actually been asked for the
summary. Again, this serves as one more way to weed
people out.
Many of the companies that recruit in the Business
School fly students to their company headquarters for
"superdays," which consist of four to eight interviews
throughout a day. I was invited to two superdays. When
I received my flight confirmation e-mails, I noticed
that the price of the ticket was always at the bottom.
These prices were astounding. In one instance, my
ticket to a nearby state and back - a one-day trip -
cost more than $900.
At the time, I didn't give it much thought. A month
later, I made travel arrangements to visit another com-
pany, this time for only one half-hour interview. It
was strange that they would fly me out for a half-hour.
When I saw the ticket price, I was amazed. $1,100 for

one plane ticket, for one day of travel. The amount of
money these companies spend on recruiting is abso-
lutely ridiculous. But if these executives don't have
time to make campus visits, it's another part of the
game that must be played.
If you're lucky enough, these interviews will hope-
fully turn into internship offers. So, now you've received
an offer and are thrilled that you won't be working at
McDonald's this summer. And while you like the compa-
ny you've been invited to join, you're still waiting to hear
back from your dream employer... so what do you do?
In my experience, employers will typically give you a
two-week window to accept or decline anoffer. But what
do you do if at the end of thattwo weeks you're still wait-
ing to hear from another company? This is where things
get tricky and where playing the game rears its ugly
head. I was in this situation just a few short weeks ago,
and I didn't know what do. I could ask for an extension,
but that could also make me look like I wasn't that inter-
ested in the position. Or, I could accept my current offer
and then go back on it later if I was accepted into my
top choice company. Neither of these alternatives were
favorable. Unfortunately, many students find themselves
in this position. In a professional setting, you don't want
to burn any bridges. When a friend of mine was being
recruited for a full-time position in finance, he strung a
company along for three weeks only to accept an offer
elsewhere. The director at the company he turned down
actually proceeded to call him on the phone and yell at
him -while using profane language - for 30 minutes.
This is an extreme case, but it can happen.
Thankfully, my situation resolved itself. But I spent
many nights on the phone with my parents and older
brother stressing about what I should I should do and
what decisions I should make. Recruiting is stressed
heavily in the Business School, but it's applicable to
all areas of study. As young students, sometimes we
don't know how to deal with tricky situations and play
these types of games. But the internship experience
is often stressed as a huge factor in determining your
full-time job out of college, and it can consume the first
few months of the year for many. As you're searching
for internships and jobs, remember the one thing that
I learned this year: Everything will work itself out. It
sounds clich, but it's almost always true.

Critical opinions should
come from dialogue

Classic Americana at its sexiest.
Boss is on the Ball

Bruce Springsteen
rocks hard on
newest release
By GEOFF MARINO
Daily Arts Writer
On NBC's "Late Night" last
Friday, Jimmy Fallon culminated
his week-long tribute to Bruce
Springsteen by
bringing the **
man himself
to the show. At Bruce
the very end of .
the interview, S s
Fallon couldn't Wrecking Ball
help but bring
up a popular Columbia
Bruce legend,
asking like the most eager of E
Street Band fanboys, "You rock
so hard, you actually broke a sta-
dium once, is this true?" Bruce
responded affirmatively, modest-
ly acknowledging that the venue
was never used again, and Fallon
couldn't help but squeal, "You
broke a stadium with rock and
roll ... only Bruce Springsteen and
the E Street Band could do that!"
Besides. unabashedly embrac-
ing his inner fanboy, Fallon, per-
haps unintentionally, unified the
end of the interview with the

theme of Bruce Springsteen's new
album, Wrecking Ball. Indicated
by its title, the album has a lot to
do with destruction. Springsteen
directly confronts the sociopo-
litical collapse that has coincided
with America's Great Recession,
urging his fellow citizens to not
be segmented and destroyed by
the demolition occurring around
them.
Springsteen puts himself in the
shoes of America's working class,
opposing the fat-cat bankers who
have initiated so much destruc-
tion in the economy. In "Jack of
All Trades," he acknowledges
one of the most vicious social
trends of the recession, "Banker
man grows fatter / Working man
grows thin." He invokes an age-
old American working-class sus-
picion of bankers, who seem as
injurious and callous as the face-
less machinery that easily knocks
down the products of hard work
- the wrecking ball.
Despite obviously drawing
lines and creating oppositions,
Springsteen's rhetoric predict-
ably hopes for unity. Tinged with
influences from his Catholic
background, he calls on the sym-
bol of Jesus to promote universal
care amidall the suffering. Again,
in "Jack of All Trades," he is opti-
mistic that the divisive culture

can be overcome, "When the blue
sky breaks / Feels like the world's
gonna change /We'll start caring
for each other like Jesus said that
we might."
As far as the music goes, it
doesn't seem to be bogged down
by the struggle embodied by the
lyrics. Springsteen's sound never
seems to let us get too low: It's
always uplifting. "Death to My
Hometown" is a gleeful sort of
Irish jig powered by Max Wein-
berg's bombastic drumming.
Exultant voices balance Bruce's
combative lyrics and condemna-
tions of robber barons.
The kind of political optimism
the album harbors could easily
fall flat on America's tired ears.
It's likely that people are sick of
that sort of rhetoric in the context
of today's political climate.
Yet, there's only one Bruce
Springsteen. His authenticity has
been cultivated ever since emerg-
ing on the music scene as an out-
sider - the pure embodiment of
rock 'n' roll. In present day, there
are few artists who command the
same sort of respect as the Irish-
Italian Catholic, blue-collar rock
'n' roller from New Jersey. So, if
anyone is allowed to barrage us
with such political platitudes and
cliches about the American soul,
it is The Boss.

In a recent YouTube pro-
motional video for his
new cable TV reality show
"Comic Book Men," Kevin Smith
railed against film critics: "You
guys have
been telling
me for years
that I suck at
my job and
I'm irrel-
evant. Guess
what, you
are. Nobody JACOB
gives a fuck AXELRAD
about crit-
ics anymore.
Nobody cares about what you
have to say."
He may be right.
Film criticism, and any criti-
cism for that matter, is neces-
sarily secondary to the work of
art in question - be it movie, TV
episode, album or a three-minute
video of Will Ferrell deliberating
over his apartment's rent with
Pearl, the baby-landlord.
That's an old argument for
criticism's lack of cultural rel-
evance: Why waste time reading
reviews when Ican go see the
movie for myself?
But there's another reason
why it's becoming increasingly
difficult for critics to hold sway
over audiences the way they once
did. In the words of Andy Sam-
berg, "everyone's a critic."
Like many viewers, I use Rot-
tenTomatoes.com. Of course,
I examine the Tomatometer
before making the trek down to
Quality 16, Rave, the Michigan
or the State theaters. But I also
check the audience tab: Hmm,
the critics gave the Navy SEAL

By CHLOE STACHOWIAK
Daily Music Editor
I'll never forget the look on my
housemate's face when I played
him the first track from the new
Korn album - a pathetic blend of
shock, wonder and extreme hor-
ror. But, considering our music
choice of the evening, who could
blame the guy? What erupted
from my computer's speakers
wasn't normal music: It was a
clunky blend of deafening noises
- bleating vocals, frenzied nu-
metal static and a corny dubstep
bassline in the background. (Korn
is now a dubstep band - surprise!)
But it wasn't even the music
itself (no matter how offen-
sive) that twisted his features
so violently: The real rub was
that Korn was releasing another
album, just when we thought
it took its "freak on a leash" act
and faded away from musical
relevance forever. After all, the
members had already granted us
the golden gift of 10 forgettable
LPs, one of which was a special
"unplugged" addition that fea-
tured acoustic guitars and nasal-
ly vocals. Why couldn't they just
let it go? How did they convince
artists like Skrillex to indulge
their confusing dubstep route?
And who thought this would be a
good idea?
Korn hasn't been the only band
that refused to be smudged from
existence, though. There have
been hordes of other musicians
that, despite rapidly diminishing
relevance, seemed like they would
never go away.
Take R.E.M. before their split
in 2011. The band was respectable
enough for a decade (or three) -
in fact, I remember listening to
"It's the End of the World As We
Know It (And I Feel Fine)" on my
toy tape recorder nonstop at the
age of four. But times changed;
people moved on. And yet, even
after releasing nothing but live
albums and mild disappoint-
ments for 10 years, R.E.M. put
out yet another LP last summer.

Michigan earns first NCAA
Tournament bid since 2001
By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily Sports Writer
Finally, the Michigan women's'
basketball team is going dancing.
In the past 11 years, the Wol-
verines have had three coaches
and multiple disappointing sea-.
sons, but more importantly, no
NCAA Tournament appearances.
But on Monday, that all
changed, as Michigan earned an
at-large berth after going 20-11
this season.
The Wolverines are the11-seed
inthe Fresno region and will play
six-seed Oklahoma in Norman, -
Okla. in the first round. The game
tips at 7:30 on Sunday night.
Michigan hasn't made an
appearance in the NCAA Tour-
nament since 2001 under coach
Sue Guevara, and the team has
made the tournament just four
other times in program history.
As part of Michigan coach'
Kevin Borseth's first recruiting
class, senior guards Courtney

pains associated with rebuilding

Burke set for first Big Dance

ByBEN ESTES
DailySports Editor
There isn't much that fresh-
man point guard Trey Burke
hasn't done in his inaugural
season for the
Michigan bas- NOTEBOOK
ketball team.
Burke's looked like a veteran
floor general in his short time
in Ann Arbor. He leads the team
in scoring with 14.8 points per
game, he's taken over games
when the Wolverines needed
him to, and he's been named
Big Ten Player of the Week and
Freshman of the Week multiple
times en route to sharing the
conference's Freshman of the
Year award with Indiana's Cody
Zeller.
But for all Burke's already
accomplished in his young
career, the Columbus native is
obviously still in his first year
and hasn't played in the NCAA
Tournament yet. That will
change on Friday against Ohio,
and Burke - who took an unof-
ficial visit to Ohio as a recruit -
couldn't be more excited.
"Growing up, that's every-
one's dream, especially if you're
playing in college," Burke said.
"Growing up, I always watched
March Madness and watched
Selection Sunday and things
like that. Just to be able to have
the opportunity to participate
in it and to actually play in it is
just a blessing."
The good thing for Burke, and
Michigan by extension, is the
point guard won't have to adjust
to playing multiple games in
multiple days. He picked up that
experience back in November
when the Wolverines played on
three straight days in the Maui
Invitational, and added to it last
weekend in the Big Ten Tourna-
ment.
If anything, despite the added
pressure in the Big Dance, it
will be more of a breather than
thosetwo events.
There's a day between games
and a week in between the ini-
tial rounds, the Sweet 16 and the
Final Four.
That rest could be huge for
Burke. He adamantly denied

being tired in Michigan's ugly
loss on Saturday to Ohio State
in the Big Ten Tournament
semifinals, even though he had
his worst performance of the
season a night after playing all
45 minutes of the overtime win
against Minnesota.
Some may still worry about
the proverbial freshman wall,
but Michigan coach John
Beilein has countered questions
about his limited rotation in the
past by pointing to how many
teams besides his own ride their

tenure.
The Wolverines were an
eight-seed last season, a dis-
tinction that comes with low
expectations considering the
matchup looming with a one-
seed in the next round. Michi-
gan was seeded even lower
three years ago, when it made
the field as a 10-seed.
Indeed, the chalk held true
after Beilein's two teams won
their initial games, falling to
Duke and Oklahoma, respec-
tively.

Michigan keeps
CCHA streak alive

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
The No. 3 Michigan hockey
team has a lot of streaks to keep
track of.
Some are as small as the team's
latest winning streak, currently
at three games. Others are longer,
like the number of consecutive
times Michigan has received abid
to the NCAA Tournament - 22,
after next weekend's selection
show.
No player really likes to bring
those streaks up, though. Any
possible mention of one being
snapped is something of a taboo
subject in and around the locker
room. It's almost as if just think-
ing it can cause it to happen.
But this week, the Wolver-
ines can sit tight, at least for the
time being. The weekend sweep
of Notre Dame means Michigan
punched its ticket to the CCHA
Tournament semifinals for the
23rd-consecutive year.
"That's a tribute to the players,
the coaches and the support we've
had from our fans," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson on Saturday.
"It's a great situation. They don't
hand it out. We had to pay our
dues, we had to earn that."
When reflecting on some of the
season's rocky points, it's hard
for the team not to get excited
about playing for the Mason Cup
at Detroit's Joe Louis Arena for
another year.
The Wolverines faced a month-
long win drought in November
and tough splits against Notre
Dame, Michigan State and Bowl-
ing Green in the last two months
before ultimately finishing out
their regular season at 21-11- 4.
Some of that has to do with the
program's direction under Beren-
son.
"A lot of really good players
have played here," said fifth-year
senior goaltender Shawn Hun-
wick. "Coach really knows what

he's talking about. The guys from
the last 24 years have been able to
bringthe intensity."
But Michigan's success has as
much to do with the environment
it plays in as the team's storied his-
tory.
The teamtakes pride in the fact
that Yost Ice Arena is one of the
CCHA's toughestvenues to play in
- and Saturday didn't disappoint.
The crowd's energy on Sat-
urday was contagious, with the
fans wanting to send the Wol-
verines off from their last home
game with a bang. When Notre
Dame took a timeout with a min-
ute remaining in the third period,
noise levels seemed to shake the
building's infrastructure to the
core. No doubt communication on
the Fighting Irish bench, situated
closest to the student section, suf-
fered.
According to senior forward
David Wohlberg, that enthusiasm
was what helped Michigan hold
off Notre Dame, even while short-
handed.
"That comes with home-ice
advantage," Wohlberg said.
"The fans here are great and
they helped us out a lot (on Satur-
day). It's one of those things that
you don't forget about when you
look back and see which games
youwon."
Michigan has averaged over
6,000 fans per game this season, a
far cry from the 3,000-some that
left the arena half-full in Beren-
son's first year at the helm in 1984.
By the end of the night, all
Michigan's seniors wanted to do
was to skate off their home ice one
last time following a win.
And they couldn't help but
smile after the game.
"Our class wanted to go out
with a bang," Hunwick said. "We
wanted to get to the Joe to keep
that streak alive. We've got a ton
of streaks to keep alive, and luck-
ily enough, we've been able to do
it so far."

And much like the last four

8 - Tuesday, March 13, 2012

orey Person has been Evan Turner. He's been Kalin
Lucas. And William Buford.
Yet, he doesn't see the floor.
In four years, the 6-foot-3 senior has seen 33 min-
utes of playing time. His fellow seniors, who walked into Ann
Arbor with him, often see 33 minutes in a single game.
Zack Novak and Stu Douglass have reaped the glory of their
work. They get the credit for transforming Michigan from a
marginal major-conference school into a basketball power.
It's Novak and Douglass who have their fingerprints all over
the Wolverines' emergence. Corey, meanwhile, has taken his
place off-stage, behind the curtains, and that's OK with him.
His dreams may not have come true, but he was still ful-
filled.
What motivates a player that doesn't get to play? How can
you be a leader when you aren't on the court? What are the
rewards for a player that doesn't get his name in the box score?
Corey has faced all those questions in his four years at
Michigan and he's found a way to answer each of them. The
walk-on from Kalamazoo, Mich. came to Ann Arbor to play,
but he's found salvation elsewhere.
The player might have been taken away, but not the Person.
It hasn't always been all work and no glory for Corey.
Kalamazoo Central High School won the conference and
the district title two straight years behind Corey. In a school
that bred such champions as Derek Jeter and Greg Jennings,
Corey established his own star status. He was named MVP of
his conference and was a first team All-State selection - both
for two straight years.
On the Maroon Giants, Corey was the standout on a team
that sent players to University of Detroit, Dayton and Austin
Peay for basketball and Cincinnati for football.
Though not a five-star recruit, Corey had options coming
out of Kalamazoo Central. He could have gone to Butler - last
year's NCAA Tournament runners-up - Western Michigan,
Central Michigan and a number of other MAC schools.
Instead, he opted to become a Wolverine, even if he would
only have walk-on status. Kelvin Grady, then a two-sport ath-
lete on the football and basketball teams, made a recruiting
pitch to Corey. Grady had played with Corey since elemen-
tary school and talked up the tradition and way of life in Ann
Arbor.
As it turns out, the choice had already been made for him.
"Because Corey was going to be the recipient of the Kalama-
zoo Promise, which is an academic scholarship," said Corey's
mother, Kimberly Smith. "My number-one focus and priority
was where was he goingto be able to go to school to getthe best
education, understanding that hopefully, he'll get an opportu-
nity to play basketball.
"But the number one priority was education."
The decision also marked the end of Corey's life at home,
one that couldn't have gone better for his mom.
"Corey's been an all-around perfect child from day one,"
Smith said. "He's an individual who's given me no problems
whatsoever. I've never had any sort of issues with Corey,
whether in school or outside of school. I've never received
a call from a teacher voicing any complaints or issues. I've
never received any calls from any parents, any neighbors, any
family.
"He's always gotten along with absolutely everybody and
he's always been perfect. Absolutely perfect."
When Corey came onto campus for the first open gym ses-
sions, he immediately bonded with the rest of his class.
"We were a very tight-knit group," Corey said. "Novak was
my roommate for the first summer when I first got here, and
Stu and Ben (Cronin) were roommates"

The four did everything together. From hanging out in the
dorms, playingvideo games, being in the gym and getting rides
to and from practice, the freshmen established strong chemis-
try well before the first game had been played.
"Of course, naturally, my ideas in my mind were that I was
going to step right in and play and make an impact with the
team right away," Corey said.
"I definitely saw myself on the same level (as the other
freshmen)."
It wouldn't be too long until Corey's freshman honeymoon
abruptly ended.
In early-season practices, Corey found out that college bas-
ketball would be a completely different animal from what he
was used to.
He was accustomed to being the bigger player, or the more
athletic player. At Michigan, he was neither.
When he wanted to score, he was used to makinga move off
the dribble and creating a shot for himself. It wasn't that easy
in college.
"Watching on TV, you think it's a certain way," Corey said.
"But once you get out there, you start to see that things are a
little bit faster, guys are more athletic.
"There were times that I would go to the basket and I would
think I would have a layup, and there would be a big guy that
would come over from the weak side and be able to block my
shot. At first, you just think it's a one-time occurrence, but then
it repeatedly happens."
It started to become clear that Corey wouldn't be a factor on
Michigan's 2008-09 squad.
While Novak and Douglass competed for a starting spot,
and Cronin saw playing time before hip injuries derailed his
career, Corey was stuck at the end of the bench.
"It was definitely a frustrating period," he said. "It's frus-
trating because you're used to being able to do certain moves
and you can't do it."
Corey's college basketball experience was nothing like he
imagined it would be.
Instead of gearing up to play on game days, he would have
to gear his teammates up. Instead of helping his team on the
court, he would settle to help by cheering from the sideline.
Instead of getting his name in the box score with numbers,
"Corey Person" ended up next to "DNP."
But just as Corey had to pick up his teammates duringgames,
it was his teammates that picked him up during the rough year.
"There were plenty of nights where after practice, C.J. (Lee)
would drop me off and talk to me for an extra 15, 20 or 30 min-
utes about just staying positive and don't doubt myself," Corey
said. "He constantly talked to me, he kept my spirits up. He
was a big help my freshman year in not getting too down on
myself"
Lee, who was a senior that season, formed an instant bond
with Corey. Both were originally from Saginaw, Mich., and
Lee could identify with what Corey was going through.
After hardly playing at Manhattan College and transfer-
ring to Michigan, and then not starting as an upperclassman at
Michigan, Lee sought out the freshman.
"When you see someone that's going through the situation
that you've gone through," said Lee, now the Administrative
Specialist for the program, "you want to reach out and you
want to encourage them and let them know that they are not
alone, and they will get through it, and if they have the right
attitude, they can succeed."
Lee stressed to Corey that the most important thing an
athlete can have is confidence in himself. He encouraged the
freshman to stay positive, and continue to have faith in his
abilities.

"It's an adjustment for the majority of all Division I ath-
letes," Lee said. "They were a star on their team and you go
from dominating the basketball and playing all the important
minutes to not dominating the ball and not playing the major-
ity of the minutes, so that is an adjustment that the majority of
us have to make."
When Corey returned to school the summer before his
sophomore year, he came with a different mindset.
Players not knowing their roles can decimate chemistry and
bring down the team. That wasn't going to be Corey.
Knowing that playing time would still be a long shot, he
started to dedicate himself to helping the team win in other
ways. A big part of that came through his dedication to the
scout team.
The scout team prepares the rotation players for the next
opponent by mimicking plays, mannerisms and styles of the
players and teams.
Again it was Lee who made an impact. Corey saw how Lee,
who was co-captain with David Merritt, was a vocal leader on
the scout team and how that lifted the team's spirits. Corey
credits Lee and Merritt's leadership with Michigan's run to
the 2009 NCAA Tournament, which ended a 14-year drought.
With Lee graduating, Corey saw his opportunity the follow-
ing year to make a difference on the scout team and be a leader
through that role.
"Once I knew he was leaving, I just saw that regardless of if
I was going to play or not, that was somethingthat I wanted to
bring to the team because I saw how much of a difference that
it made," Corey said. "I saw it as, even though it's behind the
scenes, it's somethingthat can make or break a team."
During that summer, Corey became more vocal and started
to push teammates in workouts and remind the team to keep
up its intensity in practice. That empowered Corey to take
pride in his work on the scout team.
Corey typically plays as the opposing team's best guard or
wing player on the scout team. He's become players like Turn-
er, Lucas and Buford. And he's helped Michigan beat each one
of them.
The scout team watches film of its opponents to prepare and
pick up the tendencies of their best players. And then, in just
a 10-minute span in practice, the scout team learns the main
plays of the next opponent and goes through those plays a few
times.
Sometimes the actions, ball movement and offensive sets
are more important than the individual players, and some-
times it's players that matter.
"The team's depending on you not to mess those plays up
and run them as good as possible," Corey said. "There's a lot of
pressure there because you know that the team is depending
on you to get them as ready as possible.
"Because if the (opposing) team comes in the next day and
they run something that either you didn't run as well or that
you didn't do, sometimes you feel like, 'Dang, I didn't prepare
the team as much as I should have.'"
In addition to learning the ins and outs of the opposing
teams, players on the scout team must also stay up-to-date on
Michigan's changes in its sets and strategies in case they're
called upon.
Corey will also replicate how certain players play defense
and guard the Wolverines' top guys.
"He's tireless in his scout-team defense," said Michigan
coach John Beilein. "He guards Tim Hardaway religiously
every day, as hard as he can be guarded."
"Coach Beilein talks to me all the time," Corey said. "He tells
me, 'You have no idea how important you are to this team.' "
