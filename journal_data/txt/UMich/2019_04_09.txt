In the fall of 2013, the Black 
Student Union e-board sat in a 
room in Palmer Commons to 
discuss the possibility of a new 
hashtag. They hoped the hashtag, 
#BBUM — or, Being Black at the 
University of Michigan — would 
create an opportunity for Black 
students at the University to share 
their experiences on campus. Little 
did the e-board know, the hashtag 
would lead to a movement that six 
years later resulted in the relocation 
of the Trotter Multicultural Center.
#BBUM went viral and gained 
traction from national media. 
Following the tradition of past 
Black 
activist 
movements 
on 

campus, the e-board created a list 
of demands and announced them 
at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
rally in 2014. Their seven demands 
included requests for increased 
representation and affordability on 
campus.
The third demand on the list was 
to move the Trotter Center, once a 
15-minute walk from the Diag, to 
Central Campus. This demand 
was the only one administrators 
agreed to meet in its entirety at 
the time, though they have since 
met the sixth demand of increased 
exposure to documents in the 
Bentley Historical Library.
This Thursday, after six years, 
the new Trotter Multicultural 
Center will open its new location on 
State Street, a 20,000-square-foot 
facility across from the Diag. The 

space will include lounges, quiet 
study and student organization 
space, reflection rooms and a 
multipurpose room that can fit up 
to 300 people.
According to an article in the 
University Record from 2016, the 
funding for the new $10 million 
Trotter Multicultural Center came 
entirely from investment proceeds 
and gifts.
In an email sent to The Daily, 
Julio Cardona, director of the 
Trotter Center, said the opening 
of 
the 
new 
Trotter 
Center 
marks a historic moment for 
multiculturalism and inclusion on 
campus.
“This is a historic time for the 
Trotter 
Multicultural 
Center,” 
Cardona wrote. “The new location 
of the building on State Street 

is an important indicator of the 
commitment of the University 
to increase accessibility to the 
center. As a supportive home and 
environment committed to social 
justice and diversity, the Trotter 
Multicultural Center will continue 
to serve as a space that promotes an 
inclusive campus climate.”
According to a timeline on the 
Trotter Center website, various 
discussions were held between 
student groups as well as Trotter 
Center officials to get input on 
the planning process for the new 
building, including town halls and 
several meetings with groups such 
as the Black Student Union, Multi-
Ethnic Student Affairs and more.

Mark 
Conger, 
a 
lecturer 
in 
the 
LSA 
Comprehensive 
Studies Program, received the 
Golden Apple Award and gave a 
lecture on Monday in Rackham 
Auditorium. His lecture, titled 
“The Local, the Global, and the 
Nature of Infinity,” discussed 
the relationship between the 

number infinity and his personal 
life.
The Golden Apple Award 
is a student-selected award 
given to professors on campus 
to 
recognize 
those 
who 
demonstrate 
exceptional 
teaching 
abilities. 
More 
nominations 
were 
received 
this year than ever before, with 
close 
to 
1,000 
submissions, 
making it the most competitive 

yet. 
Students 
nominate 
professors 
using 
a 
Google 
form 
circulated 
throughout 
campus groups by the event 
coordinators. Education junior 
Kyle Riebock, president of the 
Golden Apple Committee, said 
Conger received many heartfelt 
nominations. 
“Not only did Mr. Conger have 
the quantity (of nominations), 
but he also really did have the 

quality, which is something 
that is not as common with 
the nominations that we see,” 
Riebock said. “I would say almost 
90 percent of his nominations 
had paragraphs about why he’s 
such an amazing teacher, and so 
it was a no-brainer at that point 
that he deserves the award.”

Following a Jan. 2 drunken 
driving arrest in Novi, Mich., 
Ann Arbor City Councilmember 
Zachary Ackerman, D-Ward 3, 
was sentenced in February to a 
year of probation and five days 
of community service. Despite 
the January arrest, Ackerman 
did not disclose his arrest to 
City Council and the public 
until he released a statement to 
the council on April 1.
After being found with a 
blood-alcohol level of 0.20 
percent, 
Ackerman 
was 
originally 
charged 
under 
Michigan’s 
“Super 
Drunk 
Law,” for which drivers with 
a 
BAC 
over 
0.17 
percent 
face extended punishments, 
even for a first time offense. 
However, after pleading no 
contest 
and 
accepting 
the 
sentence 
in 
late 
January, 
Ackerman’s 
charge 
was 
reduced to a year’s probation.

Dean announces all rooms will include clear

Rackham 
student 
David 
Helps, 
a 
member 
of 
the 
Graduate 
Employees’ 
Organization, is heading up a 
working group in collaboration 
with 
other 
student 
organizations on campus on the 
new felony disclosure policy. 
The policy, which requires the 
immediate disclosure of all 
felony charges and convictions 
for all University of Michigan 
employees, does not apply to 
those protected by a union. 
Even though the policy does 
not apply to union members, 
Helps said he has other roles 
at the University that are 
impacted by the policy and 
GEO has an obligation to 
advocate for the entire student 
body.
“I have other capacities at 
the University, including as 
a research assistant, that are 
impacted by this,” Helps said.

ANN ARBOR

In an email to staff and 
faculty in the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance sent out on 
Feb. 14 by SMTD dean David 
Gier, the school announced it 
will be replacing all faculty, staff, 
practice room and instrument 
storage 
doors 
to 
include 
transparent panels. The change 
has not been announced publicly, 
but according to the email it is 
due to a “heightened climate … 
surrounding sexual misconduct 
prevention.”
Gier’s email explained the 
specifications of the doors, which 
will be installed over the summer.
They will be “...consistent in 
size, 
completely 
transparent, 
wide enough to support broad 
room visibility, and low enough 
to support wheelchair height 
visibility.” 
Gier explained they come after 
“a review of our buildings … in 
partnership with the Office of 
the Provost,” Dean Gier wrote. 
“We have come together unified 
in the opinion that in order 
to foster a community ethos 
around occupant safety and the 
prevention of sexual misconduct, 
we must alter our physical 
spaces.”
These 
changes 
come 
on 
the heels of the publication of 
multiple 
sexual 
misconduct 
allegations against former SMTD 
professor Stephen Shipps and 

professor David Daniels. In both 
instances, further investigation 
into the situation has brought 
administrative 
responses 
to 
these allegations into question. 
In the case of Daniels, SMTD 
awarded Daniels’s tenure in 
May 2018 despite being made 
aware of misconduct allegations 
against him as early as March 
2018. In the case of Shipps, an 
email regarding an allegation 
of “statutory rape” to the then-
interim dean of SMTD went 
unanswered for more than a year.
In an email to The Daily, Mark 
Clague, SMTD associate dean 
for academic and student affairs, 
spoke of the administration’s 
response to heightened concerns 
around sexual misconduct.
“We believe the update to 
SMTD studio and office doors 
increases transparency within 
the SMTD community both 
literally 
and 
symbolically,” 
Clague 
wrote. 
“Literally 
it 
makes the activities in what 
have historically been limited-
view 
or 
unviewable 
spaces 
more public. Symbolically it 
sends an important message 
to our community and beyond 
that 
everyone 
deserves 
an 
environment that is safe and 
in which they can comfortably 
and 
confidently 
accomplish 
the artistic work that is our 
educational mission.”

Dreams2Reality, a program 
for metro Detroit high school 
students 
sponsored 
by 
PILOT, concluded their year-
long program Monday with 
Dream Day, a day-long event 
in the University of Michigan 
School of Education.
PILOT 
is 
a 
student-
led 
organization 
with 
a 
goal to develop leadership 
skills 
and 
encourage 
campus 
engagement 
within 
underrepresented 
communities. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Una 
Jakupovic is a member of 
PILOT and co-led D2R this 
year. 
Jakupovic 
explained 
the premise of the program.
“PILOT is an organization 
founded with the mission 

to serve underrepresented 
communities and aid those 
students in their transition 
to college,” Jakupovic said. 
“PILOT’s 
programs 
focus 
on leadership development 
for 
students 
in 
these 
communities, 
and 
PILOT 
does this through various 
projects, 
which 
includes 
Dreams2Reality.”
D2R, 
a 
sub-committee 
of PILOT, consists of four 
workshops 
in 
Detroit 
throughout 
the 
year 
that 
discuss social justice-related 
topics 
with 
high 
school 
freshmen and sophomores.
Approximately 
25 
high 
school students participated 
in Dream Day this year. 
Throughout 
the 
day, 
the 
students went on a tour 
of the campus, conversed 
with University staff and 

faculty 
and 
talked 
to 
a 
panel of University students 
regarding their experiences 
on campus.
Jakupovic said the main 
goal of the program is to aid 
the students as they apply to 
college.

“We hope that this program 
inspires these students to 
pursue higher education and 
to know that despite being 
from underrepresented and 
marginalized communities, 
they do have a support 
system and resources at 
this University and other 
colleges as well to support 
them in their transition to 
college,” Jakupovic said.
D2R Project Coordinator 
Giovanna 
Bautista, 
LSA 
sophomore, said she became 
involved with PILOT after 
seeing 
the 
community 
it created. She said the 
program 
cultivates 
an 
environment for leadership 
development in which she 
feels comfortable.
“We hope to promote 
their 
post-secondary 
education, 
first 
of 
all,” 
Bautista 
said. 
“Though 
we know that college isn’t 
for 
everybody, 
and 
we 
don’t necessarily say, ‘Oh, 
go to college,’ it’s more 
broadening their options. 
For them to know that 
there is a community here 
for them especially — a 
lot of them seek a lot of 
support that they wouldn’t 
find otherwise in their high 

school. They literally would 
have 
never 
worked 
with 
anyone who is passionate 
about the things they are. 
Building a community for 
them that will help them 
broaden 
their 
options, 
whether it’s college or not.”
Zeinab Alghanem is a high 
school sophomore at Fordson 
High School in Dearborn. 
Through her participation 
in D2R and Dream Day, 
Alghanem said she now is 
considering 
applying 
to 
the University of Michigan 
and is interested in either 
philosophy, 
psychology 
or 
journalism. 
She 
said 
she 
plans to go to law school and 
continue to work in social 
justice.
“The 
most 
important 
(takeaway) 
was 
to 
be 
vulnerable and that there’s 
empowerment and strength 
in 
being 
vulnerable,” 
Alghanem said. “… This was 
a really great opportunity for 
us to network and have the 
opportunity of questioning 
ourselves 
and 
striving 
to 
know that we can do better.”
The event also discussed 
the 
Big 
House 
Program, 
an 
additional 
program 
sponsored by PILOT, aims 
to help high school seniors 
apply to college. Jakupovic 
said 
her 
participation 
in 
the 
Big 
House 
Program 
confirmed her decision to 
join PILOT upon arriving to 
the University.
“The Big House Program 
focuses on aiding students 
from 
underrepresented 
communities 
in 
the 
application 
process 
and 
the transition to college,” 
Jakupovic 
said. 
“… 
Upon 
going to the University, I 
wanted to give back to those 
same communities and help 
other students as I received 
that same help from PILOT 
during my senior year.”

In an interview with The Daily, 
LSA freshman Andrew Gerace 
suggested that while this was 
an important step to address 
concerns over sexual misconduct, 
more should be done by SMTD to 
address this issue.
“I think it will help students 
feel more comfortable. And that’s 
an important step to take,” Gerace 
said. “But I think what the music 
school needs to grapple with is the 
gray, squishy areas.”
Gerace also expressed surprise 
at how this policy was being 
implemented thus far. Despite 
being a member of the Jazz Lab 
Ensemble, he said he had heard 
nothing about this policy from 

faculty or students around SMTD.
“I am baffled by the fact that the 
music school continues to try and 
talk about transparency, and even 
with a policy that is literally trying 
to augment physical transparency, 
they’re still going behind the 
students’ backs,” Gerace said. 
Besides this new door policy, 
SMTD has taken multiple steps 
recently 
to 
address 
sexual 
misconduct 
concerns. 
They 
announced the formation of a 
Faculty and Staff Allies Network 
(FASAN) 
intended 
to 
change 
campus culture by improving 
communication and transparency 
regarding sexual misconduct and 
gender bias.
“The Faculty and Staff Allies 
Network … is a volunteer effort by 
SMTD faculty and staff to discuss 
and address issues across SMTD 

concerning 
sexual 
misconduct, 
equality, and safety. To date, it 
has supported dialogue, faculty 
and staff training efforts,” Clague 
wrote. “We expect FASAN to 
continue into next academic year 
and beyond. Its efforts are vital for 
the SMTD community.”
As part of this effort, SMTD 
also held a panel discussion in mid-
November featuring University 
administrators 
around 
sexual 
misconduct. In late-February, the 
school held another event around 
sexual misconduct. Yet despite 
pledges at these events of increased 
transparency between students 
and faculty, Gerace expressed 
surprise that SMTD administrators 
had not announced these changes 
being planned SMTD buildings.
“I think the dialogue needs 
to be continuous,” Gerace said. 

“After that panel we were told we 
would be informed about steps 
that would be taken regarding this 
issue, but here we go, learning from 
hearsay, instead of getting direct 
messaging from the University. 
… it’s connecting back to letting 
students know what’s going on, 
recognizing mistakes are made in 
both the way this was handled, in 
the way the situation was allowed 
to occur, recognizing the fact that 
situations have occurred, not just 
that this is ‘heightened awareness 
around sexual assault.’ ”
The Daily spoke with a current 
SMTD faculty member about this 
change. They requested anonymity 
in order to speak candidly about 
the new policy without fear of 
profession repercussions.
“My priority is that our students 
feel safe,” the faculty member 

said. “If having a larger window in 
the door of our studios helps our 
students feel more safe, I believe 
we should spare no expense.”
The faculty member noted that 
while SMTD has seen many public 
allegations 
recently 
of 
sexual 
misconduct, these concerns are 
not unique to the University of 
Michigan.
“It does feel a little bit to me 
like an optics reactions to the 
accusations that we have seen at 
our school,” the faculty member 
said. “And my hope is that what this 
does is sparks a larger conversation 
across the country because this 
bad behavior is not exclusive to 
the University of Michigan, by 
any means. And my hope is that 
we can have more broad actions 
in academia with regards to what 
systems are in place that enable bad 

behavior.”
Clague 
also 
wrote 
of 
the 
changes that need to take place 
both at the University and in the 
larger performing arts community 
as it works to address heightened 
concerns 
around 
sexual 
misconduct.
“It’s also important to note that 
the changes needed at SMTD and 
in the performing arts industry as 
a whole will not be solved by any 
one action or person. It will take 
a commitment from everyone,” 
Clague wrote. “At SMTD, we see 
all faculty, staff and students as 
vital and necessary partners to 
make our community stronger and 
safer. We need everyone’s help to 
address issues of sexual justice 
with courage and action.”

SMTD

“And many people within 
GEO hold such positions, so in 
addition to being GSIs (graduate 
student instructors), they might 
have other paid positions that are 
affected by this … you know, all of 
us as GSIs as GSSAs, as graduate 
students taking courses, are part 
of a broader U of M community. 
And it’s important for us to show 
solidarity invested in creating 
an equitable, safe and inclusive 
University community.”
The 
working 
group 
is 
a 
collaboration between GEO and 
other 
student 
organizations, 
including UMich Behind Bars 
and the Carceral State Project. 
While the working group is still 
in its founding stages, Helps 
said the goals of the group 
are to amplify what work is 
already being done, to draw 
more attention to the policy and 
to foster an environment for 
productive dialogue about the 
effects of the policy and others 
like it.
The felony disclosure policy 
has garnered a lot of criticism 
from 
different 
groups 
on 
campus. Some say it violates due 
process and disproportionately 
targets minority communities 
through flaws in the criminal 
justice system. The Carceral 
State Project released an open 
letter to the University on the 
policy, and it currently has 
1,867 signatures. In addition, 
the University administration 
has 
been 
criticized 
by 
the 
Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs for not asking 
for their input on the policy 
before its implementation.
Helps echoed these concerns 
and said the University has other 
policies regarding people who 
have a criminal history that is 
not made public. He said the 
University should be moving 
towards banning the box and 
stopping 
background 
checks 
rather 
than 
implementing 

policies like the felony disclosure 
policy.
“In addition to the most recent 
policy, the University also has 
a number of policies, many 
(of) which are not public, that 
prevent people with criminal 
convictions or felony convictions 
or felony charges from attending 
the University and working for 
the University,” Helps said. “It’s 
my hope, personally, to see them 
actually align the set of policies 
that exist at the University more 
with the best practices of the 
Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, the Department of 
Education and what many other 
universities are doing.”
Helps said he hopes the 
University administration will 
become more transparent and 
make all policies regarding the 
criminal justice system available 
to the public. He feels policy 
should be rescinded and replaced 
with a new one that does not 
further criminalize those with a 
criminal history.
“We 
know 
what 
policies 
would actually address sexual 
harassment and sexual assault, 
and this policy isn’t that, you 
know,” Helps said. “So, my 
hope is that we would be able to 
have the University first make 
those policies publicly available, 
because many of them are not, 
and then begin to address those 
policies and make them much 
more in line with what the 
general trend amongst employers 
and 
institutions 
of 
higher 
learning is.”
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel addressed the policy at 
the University’s Board of Regents 
meeting on March 28. He said 
the policy was created with the 
intention of keeping the campus 
safe. He noted the University has 
been doing background checks 
during the application process for 
six years and this policy does not 
mean an employee who disclosed 
a felony charge or conviction 
would face consequences.
“University 
leaders 
believe 
that information about a faculty 
or 
staff 
member’s 
criminal 
activity helps us maintain a 

safe 
community,” 
Schlissel 
said. “We’ve been obtaining 
such information on most new 
employees by way of a pre-
employment background check 
since 2013. The new policy 
requires disclosure of current 
felony charges and convictions 
by current employees. To be 
absolutely 
clear: 
History 
of 
a felony conviction does not 
automatically 
prevent 
an 
applicant 
from 
working 
at 
the University, nor would it 
necessarily result in a current 
employee losing their job.”
Schlissel 
then 
cited 
an 
example of a situation when 
the policy would be useful. 
He addressed aspects of the 
controversy 
surrounding 
the 
policy and stated the University 
will review the cases closely to 
assure it does not have a stronger 
impact on minority groups.
“Knowing about a serious 
criminal 
charge 
allows 
the 
University to take timely action 
in instances where there could 
be a significant risk of harm in 
the workplace,” Schlissel said. 
“For instance, if a staff member 
who works with or near children 
is being prosecuted for or is being 
convicted of felony assault of a 
child, a disclosure would allow 
us to remove the individual 
from that environment. We will 
carefully monitor the results of 
this new policy to make sure it 
does not have disproportionate 
effects on specific subsets of our 
community.”
LSA junior Hannah Agnew, a 
student organizer with UMich 
Behind Bars, said despite what 
the University says about this 
policy, it will inherently impact 
minority 
populations 
more 
significantly due to the nature of 
the criminal justice system.
“Inevitably, 
even 
if 
the 
University is saying that they’re 
not going to target people of color 
or low-income status, that is what 
the carceral state does in the way 
that it functions,” Agnew said. 
“Inevitably, people that have 
convictions are people of color or 
low-income communities, those 
are the communities that tend to 

be over policed and surveilled, so, 
inevitably it is those people and 
those groups that the University 
is going to deter through this 
policy and target. There is no 
way to really separate those 
communities from this policy 
because they’re the ones that 
disproportionately have prior 
convictions and records.”
GEO President Emily Gauld, 
a Rackham student, said GEO 
is 
a 
union 
that 
advocates 
for 
all 
University 
students 
to make the University the 
most 
conducive 
environment 
for 
higher 
education. 
Gauld 
discussed how GEO decided to 
get involved regardless of the 
policy’s impact on members of 
the union because it does impact 
graduate students not part of 
GEO and other members of the 
University community due to 
the disproportionate effects the 
criminal justice system has on 
people of color and those of lower 
socioeconomic status.
“We recognize that the policy 
has a lot of reasons, a lot of 
concerns, that kind of revolve 
around the existing biases in 
the 
criminal 
justice 
system 
and the implications that a 
policy like this could have for 
not only our members but the 
broader University community,” 
Gauld said. “And we are really 
dedicated to finding a solution 
that would avoid putting an 
unwanted or unnecessary extra 
barrier for graduate student 
workers that are already facing a 
difficult system, so we recognize 
the problems with it.”
Gauld 
said 
while 
GEO 
understands why the University 
administration 
created 
this 
policy, they also believe there 
is a more effective way for the 
University to achieve its goal.
“We 
also 
recognize 
that 
our members and many others 
have said that they recognize 
that there are reasons that the 
University might create a policy 
like this and we’re also interested, 
you know,” Gauld said. “We want 
to acknowledge those reasons 
but also find a better solution for 
what exactly it is the University’s 

trying to achieve and we don’t 
feel like this policy is the best 
means to do that.”
Helps 
discussed 
the 
importance of collaborating with 
other organizations on campus 
through this working group. He 
said the felony disclosure policy 
impacts everyone on campus and 
claimed the University did not 
ask for any input from the expert 
faculty and staff or students who 
would be affected by it.
“We are the flagship public 
university in the state, and 
so this is an opportunity to 
overcome all sorts of silos that we 
end up in, and to actually points 
to a way in which this policy, 
which was, you know, totally 
arbitrarily and un-transparently, 
undemocratically, 
and 
very 
quietly forced through,” Helps 
said. “This is the type of policy 
that affects all of us in that it’s 
an opportunity to think about 
what we have in common as 
people who play different roles 
within the University but who 
are all, nonetheless, affected by 
this policy that’s being forced 
upon us without any of our input 
in telling the University what 
policies would actually make us 
feel safe.”
Gauld 
said 
GEO 
has 
an 
obligation to advocate for the 
well-being 
of 
all 
graduate 
employees at the University 
of Michigan. She said having 
multiple student groups come 
together 
to 
pressure 
the 
University to rescind the policy 
magnifies the strength of their 
voices.
“I think that it’s important for 
all of the student groups to get 
involved because it’s very much 
the reason that organizations like 
GEO and other student groups 
exist because we have a better 
chance of having a voice when we 
all voice that together, when we 
come together,” Gauld said. “So 
I think that, especially GEO as a 
labor union, has a responsibility 
for us to stand up for our 
members who might be facing 
unnecessary discrimination in 
the workplace because of a policy 
like this.”

2016 LSA graduate Arnold Reed, 
who was president of BSU during 
the #BBUM movement, said the 
opening of the new Trotter Center 
exemplifies the power and reach 
of students’ voice on campus. 
However, he cautioned that it may 
be too early to understand what 
the development of the new center 
means in terms of the University’s 
responsiveness to Black students’ 
needs.
“It shows that students coming 
together are extremely powerful 
and so if you come together and 
unite, you never know what’s going 
to happen,” Reed said. “... I think 
it shows that the administration, 
they pledged the money, they got 
this thing built, and it’s right on 
State Street. So I think that they are 
responsive to student needs, but like 
I said again, that was something 
that came after years and years of 
activism. We’ll see what it means. 
It could be too early to tell, we’ll 
have to see how the building is used, 
who’s using it, for what purposes. 
If it fulfills its mission of Trotter 
Multicultural Center, I think that’s 
the biggest thing.”
LSA sophomore Thomas Vance, 
the Seba on BSU’s e-board, said the 
best metric to use when measuring 
the University’s responsiveness is if 
they have met the demands, or are 

attempting to meet them.
“Having our records in the 
Bentley and more transparency 
around conversations that were 
happening during Black Action 
Movements, that’s a plus, and the 
new Trotter on State Street is also 
a plus,” Vance said. “But things like 
trying to increase Black recruitment 
and retention … are pretty damning, 
and very telling, because they reflect 
this possible resource disparity, 
or possible lack of attention to the 
needs of Black students.”
Vance 
said 
he 
can’t 
say 
definitively whether the University 
has met the needs of Black students 
on campus.
“While student organizations are 
doing what they can to advocate for 
the community that they represent, 
at some point that all needs to come 
from the University, and I’m not 
sure if there’s a solid answer as to if 
are they are meeting the needs (of 
Black students),” Vance said.
Reed said he was surprised the 
new center was built so soon.
“When you’re a group of students 
and you’re trying to make change, 
you definitely expect the University 
to listen to you, to have some 
dialogue,” Reed said. “But then, 
for the change where it’s multiple 
millions of dollars and involves 
breaking ground and building a new 
building … In my wildest dreams 
and expectations, I still don’t know 
if I necessarily imagined the new 
building being built so quickly. I 

knew this was the type of demand 
where I wouldn’t necessarily be on 
campus to see it through to fruition, 
but I didn’t think it would happen 
within 10 years.”
2018 LSA graduate Haleemah 
Aqel, 
program 
coordinator 
at 
the 
Program 
on 
Intergroup 
Relations and an activist in the 
Arab-American 
community, 
toured Trotter with her office and 
noticed a collage dedicated to the 
#BBUM movement. Aqel said that 
those who enter the building can 
“automatically 
understand” 
the 
history of the history of the BBUM 
movement, as well as other activist 
movements featured on separate 
walls. 
Aqel 
said 
she 
appreciated 
#BBUM’s important role in securing 
a centralized location for Trotter. 
She also noted how Arab-American 
activism, such as the #WeExist 
and #UMDivest campaigns, was 
not featured on the walls, although 
she said this may be updated in the 
coming years.

“I think one of the things they 
were trying to push is that activism 
will always grow on this campus, so 
we want to adjust our walls to reflect 
the history,” Aqel said. “I was kind 
of surprised that #UMDivest wasn’t 
on there, or #WeExist, but at the 
same time I recognize how #BBUM 
was really the big push to have this 
space over here on State Street.”
Cardena said the images adorning 

the walls are current through 
October 2017 and the center intends 
to update the graphics on a regular 
basis.
“To address potential concern 
over inclusion of images from 
#WeExist or #UMDivest, there will 
be opportunities as materials from 
those important student movements 
as well others are chronicled by 
the Bentley Historical Library and 
are available to us to include in 
future wall graphic iterations in the 
Sankofa Lounge,” Cardena said.
LSA junior Dim Mang, incoming 
co-chair for the United Asian 
American Organizations, said the 
new location will make it easier for 
new students to attend events and 
participate in the activities offered 
by Trotter.
“I’m really excited just to be able 
to walk a couple of minutes to new 
Trotter, instead of having to go 
all the way down South U,” Mang 
said. “I think that when you have a 
centralized location, more people 
are bound to show up because 
you can just see the building. 
Even people who aren’t in those 
communities are able to show up to 
events.”
Aqel said the new location may 
attract students who would not 
usually visit the center.
“I think it will be interesting, 
one, to see who goes into the space,” 
Aqel said. “Because the Trotter 
on Washtenaw, it was always just 
people of color. But now that you 

have this Trotter on State Street, I’m 
wondering if more white students 
will go into the space, how inclusive 
it’ll be. I think so long as students 
recognize the history of the space 
and why the space moved to State 
Street, I think it’s fine. But I also 
see this space being for students 
of color and students who have 
worked effortlessly within different 
activism 
movements 
on 
this 
campus.”
Aqel said she appreciated the 
thought put into the space. As 
a student, she worked toward 
increasing the number of reflection 
rooms on campus, which many 
Muslim students use to pray. When 
Aqel toured Trotter with the IGR 
office, she was happy to find a 
reflection room, along with a station 
for wudu, which Muslim students 
use to wash themselves before 
prayer.
“It’s small, there could be more, 
but it’s something, because there 
isn’t anything on this campus, or 
other campuses in general, that 
have something like that,” Aqel said. 
“So I was just like, ‘Wow.’ And I was 
going with the rest of my coworkers, 
and they were just really happy to 
see my reaction, because we had 
been working so hard to create more 
reflection spaces, and then Trotter 
really spent a lot of time thinking 
about what Muslim students would 
need, or other students who would 
be using this space.”
LSA sophomore Ronnie Alvarez, 

co-director of La Casa, said he 
appreciates how Trotter prioritized 
student needs.
“They 
have 
specific 
rooms 
that cannot be reserved at all by 
offices, so it’s just for students,” 
Alvarez said. “And they also always 
prioritize us — student events — 
over any other reservations. The 
director of Trotter, he let a lot of the 
cultural student orgs know, ‘Yo, this 
is a space for you, and as soon as the 
Trotter opening week begins, we 
want to include all of you.’”
The opening will be followed by 
the Trotter Grand Extravaganza 
— two weeks of events to celebrate 
the new space. Vance said the 
Extravaganza seeks to remind 
students that Trotter is not just a 
study space, but a space with a hard-
fought, unique history.
“One of the things we were 
concerned about is, well, we don’t 
want Trotter to just become a 
new study space,” Vance said. 
“The history of it, and how hard 
organizations have had to work for 
it, we didn’t want that history to 
be lost by students thinking it was 
just another study space, which 
is why we engaged in intentional 
programming to make sure that, 
at least during the grand opening, 
it’s not used as a study space, but 
rather used as a place that these 
organizations can get together and 
have a place for their communities.”

According 
to 
Sergeant 
Kevin Gilmore, a Novi police 
detective, police brought in 
Ackerman around 5:30 p.m. 
on Jan. 2 after he got in an 
accident in stop-and-go traffic.
“He rear ended someone 
near Beck (Road) and 10 Mile,” 
Gilmore said. “The officer 
got there and noticed that 
Mr. Ackerman’s eyes were 
bloodshot and glossy and he 
had slurred speech. Talking 
to him, he had the odor of 
intoxicants coming from his 
vehicle and from his person.”
Gilmore also explained that 
while Ackerman’s actions were 
reckless and dangerous, such 
arrests are made relatively 
frequently in law enforcement.
“It was nothing out of the 
ordinary in our line of work — 
a car accident where someone 
ended up being intoxicated, 
we 
arrested 
him, 
held 
him, released him the next 
morning,” Gilmore said.
In the weeks following the 
arrest, 
however, 
Ackerman 
neglected 
to 
inform 
his 
constituents and fellow Ann 
Arbor councilmembers, only 
disclosing 
information 
to 
fellow 
councilmembers 
on 
March 27, followed by an April 
1 City Council statement.
“This happened nearly three 
months ago,” Ackerman said in 
the statement to City Council. 
“I did not disclose any of this to 
anyone at this table until this 
past Wednesday. I recognize, 
that as public officials, we walk 
a fine line between what should 
and should not be private. I 
considered this a private part 
of my life because these events 
were a wake-up call. They 
were a wake-up call that I had 
a serious, and now diagnosed 
health issue — Severe Alcohol 
Dependence.”

These frustrations culminated 
in a seven-hour sit-in at the 
Fleming Administration Building 
following the March 15 Global 
Strike for Climate, after which, 
at the sit-in, 10 students were 
arrested for trespassing. Student 
organizations on campus, such as 
Climate 
Actio366.n 
Movement, 
Students for Clean Energy and 
others, have continued to pressure 
the administration and Schlissel to 
commit to more aggressive goals 
for carbon neutrality as well as 
to increase engagement with the 
student body.
We applaud the climate activism 
taking place on campus, especially as 
the institutional processes Schlissel 
implements further our mistrust 
of the University administration. 
There is historical precedent for our 
apprehension of University climate 
action. In 2015, the Greenhouse Gas 
Reduction Committee released a 
report detailing how the University 
can meet its sustainability goals, but 
most recommendations have been 
ignored by the University’s Board of 
Regents. Both the 2015 commission 
and the current commission are 
toothless simply because they are 
merely recommendations. The only 
way to ensure action is a binding 
commitment.
But our skepticism is not 
just based on the past. The 
current 
administration 
and 
commission have not earned our 
trust. We are suspicious of the 
commission because it does not 
have appropriate representation. 
Corporate executives from DTE 
and Consumers Energy each have 
full voting rights on the commission 
— the same number of votes as the 
entire student body. For us, this 
represents a serious conflict of 
interest because, as our primary 
energy 
provider, 
DTE 
stands 
to profit from the University’s 
continued dependence on fossil 
fuels. We understand DTE and 
Consumers Energy need to be a part 
of the conversation because they 
have expertise in transitioning from 
fossil fuels to renewables, but they 
do not need to be voting members. 
It would be more reasonable for 
them to serve in an advisory role 
instead. Furthermore, while there 
are two corporate executives on the 
commission, there are no faculty 
representatives for environmental 
justice despite many experts on 
the issue from the School for 
Environment and Sustainability.
We are also suspicious of the 
commission because Schlissel is not 
harnessing the advice of experts to 
make the right decisions about the 
University’s carbon footprint. The 
primary way Schlissel has done 
this is by stopping the commission 
from discussing two of the essential 
components of carbon neutrality: 
the expansion of the Central Power 
Plant and the University endowment 
investment in fossil fuels. Though 
the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change made clear that 
the world needs to cut global carbon 
emissions in half by 2030 in order to 
avoid catastrophic effects of greater 
than 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, 
the University has ignored this 
urgent report, opting instead to 
start construction on an $80 million 
expansion of the Central Power 
Plant. The University claims that 

expanding our natural gas profile 
will reduce emissions via energy 
efficiency, but in reality this decision 
will bind us to fossil fuels for years 
to come. The expansion ignores the 
latest science that questions that 
reasoning, as methane leaks are a 
significant externality of natural gas 
production. Methane has a higher 
global warming potential than 
carbon dioxide, making it unclear 
if the CPP expansion will help the 
University get to carbon neutrality. 
The commission should be allowed 
to recommend that the University 
halt the CPP expansion.
Furthermore, the commission 
should also be empowered to 
recommend that the University 
divest from fossil fuels. Though the 
University does not advertise how 
much of its endowment is invested 
in natural resources such as fossil 
fuels, numbers from the 2017 
Report of Investments put the total 
investment in natural resources at 
$925 million. The University should 
consider its investments in fossil 
fuels as part of its carbon footprint. 
Consequently, 
Schlissel 
should 
empower the commission to talk 
about the endowment’s role in the 
climate crisis. In fact, recent trends 
show investment in renewables can 
yield high returns as the renewable 
sector is outpacing traditional fossil 
fuels.
The University has shown 
reluctance toward acting in the best 
interest for the community at large. 
For example, in 2000, when the 
University divested from tobacco 
companies, the final vote from the 
Board of Regents was four in favor, 
two abstentions and one against, 
despite tobacco representing less 
than .25 percent of the endowment’s 
investments. 
The 
only 
other 
example of the University divesting 
was in 1988 due to apartheid in South 
Africa. Other than those examples, 
the University has largely avoided 
engaging in dialogue surrounding 
divestment, including the climate 
fight.
In order to create more effective 
change, 
the 
University 
should 
include more than just one student 
on the commission and in the 
planning and development of a more 
environmentally-conscious campus. 
The University has consistently 
denied requests for a commitment 
to carbon neutrality by 2030, even 
though student support has been 
rapidly increasing. One way to 
integrate the student body into its 
decision-making 
process 
would 
be to give students more powerful 
voting rights on a committee that has 
a central role in working alongside 
the University to combat carbon 
emissions. The student group would 
need to be diverse and have a deep 
understanding of environmental 
justice, 
since 
marginalized 
communities around the world 
are disproportionately impacted 
by climate change. The University 
needs to serve its students, and the 
only way to do that is for the student 
body to be at the forefront of this 
fight.
Students have repeatedly asked 
the University to take real climate 
action, and the University should 
listen and act accordingly. The 
threat of climate change is dire 
and the University’s actions do not 
reflect its urgency and severity. 

In expanding the CPP, failing to 
commit to carbon neutrality and 
expanding our investments in fossil 
fuels, the University is failing to 
be a leader on clean energy. The 
University has branded itself as 
an institution dedicated to solving 
global problems; students flock 
here to learn the skills necessary 
to change the world. When the 
administration works against the 
values and goals of the students, 
when the Board of Regents ignores 
the University’s own research on 
climate change and when students 
peacefully protesting are arrested 
rather than heard, prospective 
applicants notice. The University 
can still be one of the leaders in 
the climate movement. By taking 
steps to prevent further harm to 
the environment, the University 
can rebrand itself as an institution 
committed to sustainability.
We recognize that transitioning 
to true carbon neutrality by 
2030 will be a challenge, but in 
our eyes, the University has a 
moral imperative to lead. The 
University can and should be a 
leader. Considering we are one of 
Michigan’s largest employers, we 
have a significant carbon footprint. 
However, this also means we have 
the greatest potential to reduce 
such residual impacts. Moreover, 
those who have felt and will feel 
the impacts of climate change 
first — marginalized communities 
around the world — are less able 
to address the crisis than we are. 
We have the power to lead because 
our endowment, at nearly $12 
billion, is one of the biggest in the 
nation, and just added a record $5 
billion. If the University, a public 
research institution accountable to 
its stakeholders, cannot meet the 
objectives set out by the IPCC, no 
one can.
We want to express our 
feelings 
of 
mistrust 
toward 
Schlissel as it pertains to his and 
the 
administration’s 
handling 
of climate policies based on 
historical evidence of mishandling, 
avoiding 
and 
lagging 
behind 
on climate issues. Despite his 
attractive, 
promising 
rhetoric 
surrounding climate change and 
the commission, little has been 
done or is known about how the 
University plans to take the lead 
and enact a just transition to true 
carbon neutrality. Not only are we 
behind other schools in committing 
to carbon neutrality, we are lagging 
on one of the most serious global 
issues of our time and the future. 
We demand the University become 
more transparent in their plans by 
giving students more power in the 
internal committee or more access 
to open, unfiltered conversations. 
We must be proactive in creating 
true, effective changes that will 
not only brand the University as 
a progressive and bold campus, 
but as one that acts with a moral 
interest in mind rather than profit. 
Furthermore, we call on student 
activists to sustain the energy 
that they’ve exhibited recently 
via protesting, organizing and 
demanding serious action. If we 
continue with this movement, and 
if the University decides to invest in 
its students’ future, we can actually 
make a difference for generations to 
come.

ABBIE BERRINGER | COLUMN

What is tolerance?
A

ccording to the Merriam-
Webster Dictionary, the 
number 
one 
definition 
of tolerance is: “the capacity to 
endure pain or hardship,” followed 
by “a sympathy or indulgence for 
beliefs or practices differing from 
or conflicting with one’s own.” Yet, 
when I hear the word “tolerance” 
thrown around on our campus, it 
rarely feels like we are talking about 
the textbook definition of tolerance 
at all.
In fact, it often seems that when 
someone is asking you to tolerate 
their opinions these days, they are 
telling you to affirm them. As a 
conservative, when I respectfully 
disagree on issues such as abortion, 
gun rights, universal health care or 
free higher education, I am often 
told that my opinions are invalid, 
insensitive or bigoted. On a college 
campus as liberal as the University of 
Michigan, with 90 percent of voters 
at campus polling places voting 
for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and a 
university president who openly 
applauded this while condemning 
students who may have voted 
for Donald Trump, it seems that 
disagreeing on such contentious 
issues is simply unacceptable.
While I have come in contact 
with this sort of problem many 
times on campus, a bright and 
shining example occurred just the 
other day when I volunteered to 
help table at an informative pro-
life event on the Diag sponsored by 
Students for Life and co-sponsored 
by Young Americans for Freedom 
and the Network of Enlightened 
Women. While standing at the table 
and engaging in thoughtful debate 
with someone who disagreed with 
us, a female student walked up to 
us and simply said, “What’s up, 
c**ts?” After this initial exchange, 
she continued to stand there 
while refusing to engage with us, 
before asking another student if 
he’d “like to get away from these 
motherfuckers?” before eventually 
storming off, flipping us off and 
yelling, “Fuck you!”
One would hope that this 
sort of experience is a rarity. One 
would also hope this individual 
represents a minority of college-
aged youth seemingly incapable 
of defending their ideologies with 
logic and intellect, who resort to 
petty insults and profanity. But 
this sort of interaction is actually 
not that rare at all. It seems that 
the mentality of the modern leftist 
movement — that their ideas are 
all together infallible — has led to a 
stark entitlement that they should 
never have to be challenged, and 
when they are, the challenges are 
automatically 
illegitimate. 
For 
example, as a political science 
student I have heard from other 

students in my classes that there 
“is not room for people like me in 
America anymore,” “small town 
conservatives 
don’t 
want 
our 
intelligence,” “conservatives have 
small minds,” “most white people 
are racist” and “conservatives hate 
women.” Additionally, in my four 
years at the University, only one of 
my professors has openly identified 
as right of center and most of my 
professors 
have 
either 
openly 
identified as liberal or made clearly 
liberal statements in class. This 
problem is only compounded by 
the “safe space” mentality that has 
gripped so many college campuses 
to date and allowed young liberals to 
think they deserve to be “shielded” 
and “protected” from opposing 
opinions by their university, which 
means the University affirms that 
this sentiment is true.
From 
my 
experience, 
the 
political left on this campus does 
not try to be tolerant of my political 
beliefs. They don’t feel that they 
need to listen to the reasoning for 
my beliefs or respect my culture and 
values. They don’t have to be tolerant 
of my notion of small government, 
the sanctity of life at conception or 
my interpretation of the Second 
Amendment. In fact, they get to 
call me names, yell, protest, and use 
the common scapegoats of “ists” 
and “isms” to dismiss legitimate 
intellectual conversation.
They don’t have to engage in 
debate with contentious political 
speakers on the other side of the 
political spectrum, either. They 
wish to shut them down, be shielded 
from them by safe spaces and deny 
their rights to free speech. When 
conservative speaker Ben Shapiro 
came to campus on March 12, 
for instance, counter protesters 
met to organize a protest that 
goals included distracting from 
Shapiro’s message by “diverging 
attendees’ attention through live 
entertainment.” 
Comments 
by 
members in attendance included 
people calling him a “right-wing 
bigot.” At the event, Shapiro 
explicitly said that anyone who 
disagreed could come to the front 
of the line for questions, as he does 
at every event, and yet there was 
not one question challenging any 
of his beliefs. Even though as a 
conservative, I agreed with much 
of what he was saying, I don’t agree 
with all of his opinions and I was 
disappointed that he did not face 
any intellectual challenges at a 
supposedly esteemed, intellectual 
campus.
While 
certain 
levels 
of 
extremism 
must 
certainly 
be 
condemned, like arguments for 
racial supremacy, this piece speaks 
to the alarming number of people on 
the left who are labeling almost all 

views contradictory to their own as 
intolerable. They say the right “hates 
women” when we push back against 
abortion, without hearing the 
complex moral, biological, as well 
as philosophical reasoning behind 
why many conservatives are pro-
life. Furthermore, if the left truly 
believes these accusations to be true, 
then shutting them down with logic 
and intellectual debate should be no 
problem at all. At the very least, they 
could use the opportunities to do so 
to prove to their base, and those who 
are on the fence, why their ideas 
are superior. They can’t do any of 
these things if all they wish to do is 
shutdown any debate at all.
As a graduating senior, I hope 
that in the future my conservative 
classmates feel more open to 
state their political ideology in 
classes and therefore have more 
opportunities to debate peers on the 
other side of the aisle. That is why I 
challenge the left movement on this 
campus. If they truly think their 
solutions will work, if they truly feel 
we conservatives are misguided, 
they should use intellectual debate 
among 
peers, 
professors 
and 
speakers on opposite sides of the 
aisle to actually defend their ideas 
instead of using catchphrases and 
profanity to try and shut us down. 
I challenge them to rise to the 
occasion of true tolerance, which 
isn’t forcing someone to affirm your 
beliefs, but accepting that in a free 
democratic society, the marketplace 
of ideas allows us to disagree. 
When they say, “love trumps hate” 
I challenge them to mean it and to 
ask themselves if they truly believe 
that conservatives really represent 
“hate.”
This 
doesn’t 
mean 
they 
can’t vehemently disagree as 
we vehemently disagree with 
them. Rather, it simply means 
coming to the intellectual table 
with a level of respect worthy of 
such a prestigious institution of 
learning. It means coming to a 
place where the opportunities to 
bring in speakers, host debates and 
engage in ideas that cover the full 
spectrum of American politics are 
virtually endless. My fear is that 
the left has truly gone so far as to 
believe the average conservative 
doesn’t deserve as much. My hope 
as a conservative on this campus 
is that with intellectual debate, 
the left will realize that we are not 
all racist, sexist or bigoted. I hope 
that people on both sides of the 
aisle will be able to challenge their 
own biases and assumptions in a 
way that benefits campus political 
life and discourse.

I

n case you were living under 
a rock, these past weekends 
had a number of college 
basketball 
games. 
I could not watch 
all of them, but the 
ones I watched were 
action 
packed 
and 
enjoyable – and they 
weren’t just enjoyable 
for those of you who 
can’t stand Duke. Per 
USA Today, the four 
coaches (Bruce Pearl, 
Tom Izzo, Chris Beard 
and 
Tony 
Bennett) 
who made it to the Final Four 
took home a combined $1 million 
in bonuses alone. The four of 
them still make gobs of money 
even without bonuses factored 
in — Virginia’s coach makes 
a total of about $4.15 million, 
Auburn’s coach had a salary of 
$2.6 million for the 2018-2019 
season Michigan State’s coach 
made $3.7 million for the 2018-
2019 season, and Texas Tech’s 
coach made $2.8 million for the 
2018-2019 season. The players, 
who I assume are the reason 
we watch these games, made a 
total of zero dollars in bonuses, 
which 
combines 
with 
their 
lucrative zero dollars during the 
season as well as their lucrative 
endorsement deals (which also 
net them zero dollars) for a grand 
total of zero dollars. Quite a 
difference, isn’t it?
In fiscal year 2017, the NCAA 
made over a billion dollars per 
their financial reports. Colleges 
also make boatloads of money 
off of their players, whether 
it be through ways that are 
ostensibly ethical, like licensing 
and deciding what shoes players 

can wear (with occasionally 
disastrous results), or through 
more blatantly unethical means, 
such as not allowing 
students 
to 
enter 
into 
likeness-based 
endorsement deals or 
even admit that they 
play college sports. 
And what do students 
get in exchange for 
enabling 
showers 
of 
gold 
for 
their 
colleges, coaches and 
conferences? 
Free 
Wi-Fi. One need not 
be a scholar of deals to see that it 
is an inordinately raw one and it is 
something decent people should 
want addressed for the sake of 
fairness.
There are several ways to go 
about addressing this – from 
paying athletes directly, allowing 
them to enter into likeness-
based 
endorsement 
deals 
or 
giving them a share of revenues. 
Athletes 
deserve 
to 
make 
money on top of their athletic 
scholarships for a number of 
reasons. Usually the hours that 
are put in are comparable to a 
full-time job (40 hours a week) 
and as a result, it can become 
more difficult to have spending 
money. Secondly, they should 
be allowed to sign endorsement 
deals with whatever brands they 
choose and should absolutely 
be free to license their likeness 
— there is no good reason that 
the league should be able to 
profit off athletes if the athletes 
themselves 
cannot. 
Lastly, 
athletes generate a lot of money 
for their institutions. There are 
some people who disagree with 
paying athletes because they 

receive scholarships, but I believe 
this is mistaken. While they do 
get scholarships, that funding is 
not remotely equivalent to the 
amount of money they generate 
for the NCAA. From SBNation, 
the back of the napkin math 
goes like this: The NCAA got 
$857 million for the broadcast 
rights to this tournament (from 
Turner Broadcasting, if you were 
wondering) and there are 68 
teams each with 13 scholarship 
spots 
for 
a 
total 
of 
884 
scholarship players and, while 
no one knows the exact value of 
a scholarship, it could probably 
be pegged from $30,000 on the 
low end to $50,000 on the high 
end. Multiplying the number of 
scholarships by the high value 
of a scholarship (and assuming 
high end costs), one gets $44.2 
million in total scholarship 
money given to NCAA players. 
Five percent of $857 million 
is $43.75 million. The total 
compensation from schools to 
players is just over five percent 
of the money the NCAA gets 
from the broadcast licensing of 
this tournament. One need not 
be a Marxist to think that this 
distribution is skewed unfairly.
Coaches, 
conferences 
and 
schools are all pivotal parts of 
the game. However, at the end 
of the day, we tune in to see the 
players, and it is time that they 
get something commensurate 
with the wealth they create for 
those above them. They have 
been geese laying golden eggs 
for far too long and deserve 
equitable treatment.

n recent weeks, there has been a surge in student activism surrounding 
the University of Michigan’s policies and commitments on climate action 
and carbon neutrality. In October, University President Mark Schlissel 
announced the President’s Commission on Carbon Neutrality, with a directive to 
create a plan for the University to go carbon neutral. However, the move has been 
met with frustration from students on campus who feel the commission lacks the 
strength, transparency and experience to enact effective change.

After fleeing to the Broadway 
scene for six years, Sara Bareilles 
is finally back with her new album, 
Amidst the Chaos. Filled with 
themes of love, feminism and 
politics, Bareilles has certainly 
made up for the lost time and has 
given fans an in-depth look to what 
she’s been thinking about during her 
time in the theatre scene.
In stark contrast to her previous 
albums that include pop anthems 
such as “Love Song” and “Brave,” 
Amidst the Chaos is richer in 
both sound and lyrics, a concrete 
representation of the ways Bareilles 
has grown to be more confident 
and vulnerable in her work. It’s no 
question that this was Bareilles’s 
intent; she teamed up with producer 
T Bone Burnett, who is famous 
for his organic approach to music 
production and focus on American 
roots in order to produce a very real, 
raw-sounding album.
From soft piano and guitar riffs 
to untouched vocal inaccuracies, 
Bareilles embraces messiness and 
clings to confidence. Although 
Amidst 
the 
Chaos 
doesn’t 
incorporate much of the musical 
theatre style fans were anticipating, 
Bareilles still strayed from her 

traditional pop sounds and opted 
for 
a 
gentler, 
jazz 
approach. 
Moreover, 
she 
unapologetically 
allows her lyrics to be politically and 
emotionally driven. From break-
up songs addressed to the Obamas 
to ballads about her own personal 
encounters with love, Bareilles 
doesn’t hesitate to testify to a broad 
array of themes for the sake of her 

own self-discovery.
The most blatant difference 
between Bareilles’s new album 
and any of her previous work is 
her prominent devotion to political 
campaigns. 
Released 
earlier 
this year before, “Armor” is an 
undoubtedly 
feminist 
anthem. 
Its lyrics confidently expose the 
patriarchy with lines such as “Blind 
men only set the world on fire.” 
Although lyrically it lies in the 
same realm as her empowerment 

anthem 
“Brave,” 
Bareilles 
has 
given fans the same feminist fire 
with a more down-to-earth sound. 
Bareilles even offers some words 
of consolation to immigrants in 
“A Safe Place to Land,” where she 
encourages travelers to “Be the light 
in the dark of this danger.”
Despite 
the 
ways 
she 
has 
incorporated ideas that fans haven’t 
seen in any of her previous works, 
Bareilles has also made sure to stay 
true to her roots by including some 
of her traditional love songs. Her 
heart-felt ode to a deadbeat lover, 
“Poetry By Dead Men,” provides a 
taste of the traditional “Bareilles 
style” fans have grown to appreciate.
What’s most notable about the 
album is the way it both empowers 
and heals. Bareilles makes it known 
this album was intended to mend 
broken feelings and experiences she 
hasn’t had the opportunity to share 
in her previous work and hopes 
others can share in that healing. 
Now that Bareilles has distinguished 
herself in both the theatre and pop 
spheres, she has definitely taken 
the liberty of toying with new 
sounds and opening up more in her 
music. Bareilles’s ambition suggests 
this is just the beginning of a new 
era. There’s no doubt that she will 
continue to amaze us with her drive 
to keep growing in her music and 
career.

Sara Bareilles comes back 
with ‘Amidst the Chaos’

A classic episode of “The 
Twilight Zone” follows a bookish, 
bespectacled 
bank 
teller 
so 
desperate for an escape from his 
demanding wife and wicked boss 
that he’s delighted when a nuclear 
explosion obliterates everyone 
on Earth but him. Finally he has 
“time enough at last” to read, 
uninterrupted. Amid the post-
apocalyptic rubble, he happens 
upon the ruins of the public 
library and giddily sorts tomes of 
Shakespeare, Shelley and Shaw 
into neat little piles to pore through 
this month and the next month 
and the one after that. 
Just as he settles in with 
a hardcover, though, he 
slips, his glasses break 
and he is rendered 
virtually blind. “It’s not 
fair! It’s not fair!” the 
man is left whimpering, 
surrounded by books 
he’ll never get to read.
If 
you 
were 
to 
reboot the story in 
2019, it might go a little 
something 
like 
this: 
Everyone is very excited 
to see how a buzzy 
auteur 
reimagines 
a 
beloved sci-fi anthology 
franchise, but in a cruel 
twist of fate, nobody can watch the 
show because it is only available 
on the risibly obscure streaming 
service CBS All Access.
For what it’s worth, CBS has 
tried admirably to make the 
subscription service worth it, 
stocking the network’s complete 
back catalogs and some streaming 
originals — a deliciously gonzo 
spinoff of “The Good Wife” and a 
new “Star Trek” show — behind 
the paywall. But unless you 
are the rare TV watcher with 
a predilection for old episodes 
of “JAG,” the consumer surplus 

calculation doesn’t really justify 
the purchase. That means some 
genuinely good shows on the site 
will have very small audiences. 
And very large potential audiences 
probably won’t get to watch them 
(It’s not fair! It’s not fair!)
One of these shows is now 
Jordan Peele’s (“Us”) uneven, 
stylish reboot of “The Twilight 
Zone,” which first aired on CBS 
from 1959 to 1964, and has actually 
been revived twice before (both 
times to middling reviews).
Peele’s 
version 
differs 
conspicuously from the original 
created by Rod Serling: The 
episode runtimes are longer, the 
signature black-and-white motif 

eschewed for luscious production 
design that just betrays menacing 
undertones. The episodes are also 
rooted in a very different present. 
In the second episode, “Nightmare 
at 30,000 Feet,” it is not a Muppet-
like gremlin that warns a flight 
passenger of an imminent crash 
as in the original, but instead a 
prophetic podcast.
But not everything of the 
original “The Twilight Zone” 
is lost. Still intact are the 
ominous Faustian bargains, the 
contrapassos that would raise 
an eyebrow from Dante, the 

staunch commitment to poetic 
justice that is equal parts amusing 
and agonizing. Peele steps into 
Serling’s narrator role and does 
it effortlessly. It’s only when he 
opens his mouth that you’ll wish 
he had been a bit more involved — 
Peele neither writes nor directs the 
show (though he is an executive 
producer), and its insipid script is 
practically screaming for a more 
inventive hand.
Serling’s original was pithy — 
sometimes funny, usually chilling, 
often didactic. And though Peele 
clearly understands “The Twilight 
Zone” and its manifest politics, 
the new version has forsaken 
what made the show work the 
first time around: A tight 
half-hour time-slot meant 
the twists came so quickly, 
the repercussive punchlines 
so unexpectedly, that you 
couldn’t 
quite 
decipher 
a given episode until it 
had ended, and you were 
basking 
in 
its 
lasting 
impression. The pacing here 
is assuredly off — the first 
episode, “The Comedian” is 
nearly a full hour long, but 
the thrill of the story wears 
off well before it ends.
Maybe this is inevitable 
when an old classic is 
recalibrated for the prestige 
TV 
age. 
(Fortunately, 
the show’s portraits of modern 
anxieties dare to go beyond the 
reflexive technophobia of “Black 
Mirror.”) But a show’s new home 
on a streaming service should 
ostensibly free it, not limit it. “The 
Twilight Zone” is, as the show’s 
opening credits famously declare, 
a middle ground between light 
and shadow, between science and 
superstition. This reboot treads 
a far less exciting middle ground: 
not untethered from convention, 
but intractably lost, chasing after 
a purpose that shouldn’t be so 
difficult to articulate.

Korine loses the vision in 
ambitious ‘Beach Bum’

There’s 
only 
one 
thing 
worse than a bad comedy: a 
pretentious one. “The Beach 
Bum” is a bland, frustrating film 
that tries to be both hilarious 
and deep, yet fails to accomplish 
either. Written and directed 
by Harmony Korine (“Spring 
Breakers”) 
and 
starring 
Matthew 
McConaughey 
(“Serenity”) in a role tailor-
made for him, the movie is a 
hollow joyride of drugs and 
excess in the Florida Keys.
The most accurate microcosm 
for 
the 
movie’s 
grandiose 
emptiness 
is 
the 
image 
of 

McConaughey’s 
Moondog, 
a 
perfectly 
grisled, 
dashingly 
hysterical, fanny-pack-strapped, 
flip-up-sunglass-donning, sex-
crazed stoner, leaning back in 
his rickety boat while clacking 
away on a typewriter. “The 
Beach 
Bum” 
animates 
the 
notion of late-night dorm-room 
philosophy — barely-coherent, 
juvenile 
ideas 
inflated 
into 
gobsmacking revelations — to 
tell a meandering, dry story of a 
man at odds with “civilization,” 
a vague, ubiquitous term that 
stands in for the film’s villain.
After a family tragedy forces 
the retired writer to finish his 
latest project in order to retain 
all his stunning wealth, he 
roams Florida in a hazy search 

for the meaning of life. The plot 
sounds corny when phrased 
this way, but the worst part of 
the movie is that it thinks it’s so 
much more than it is. Occasional 
solid editing and admittedly 
impressive visuals can’t cover 
up one simple fact: It’s a dumb 
idea for movie.
Another unaware summation 
of the film’s pompousness is a 
scene in which Moondog reads 
aloud one of his new poems at 
an academic ceremony. The 
poem is frankly terrible — a 
lewd anecdote about bestiality 
written during an acid trip 
— and the audience erupts 
in raucous applause. This is 
what Korine so desperately 
wants from the audience of 

his own film, an enthusiastic 
appraisal of crude writing. But 
the most pretentious moment 
in the whole film is a slow 
motion, semi-biblical montage 
of homeless junkies throwing 
furniture in a lavish pool set to a 
crisp orchestra. The scene is so 
ridiculous and overblown that I 
physically cringed 
in 
response. 
To 
be 
fair, 
when 
the film stopped 
worrying 
about 
its 
overbearing 
ideas, 
it 
almost 
worked. 
“The 
Beach Bum” has 
its funny moments, 
including a shark 
attack scene that 
had 
me 
doubled 
over with laughter, 
but for the majority 
of the time I was 
not grinning. I was 
just waiting for the 
mess to be over.
By 
the 
time 
the 
film 
ended 
in 
a 
thunderous 
explosion, 
I 
felt 
like I had missed a 
birthday. 
Despite 
a brisk runtime of 95 minutes, 
“The Beach Bum” felt like an 
eternity, hopping from drug-
fueled episode to drug-fueled 
episode 
without 
a 
concrete 

narrative. 
Despite Moondog’s largely 
lethargic 
character 
arc, 
McConaughey was thoroughly 
entertaining and perfect for 
the role. His unique drawl and 
graceful charisma are ideal for 
the seedy ease of Moondog. It 
never feels like he’s performing, 

just 
exuding 
the 
maturely 
ironic aspect of his charm that 
comes through in every role of 
his. And yet, none of the film’s 
other characters are even a 

little 
bit 
interesting. 
Both 
Isla Fisher (“Tag”) and Snoop 
Dogg (“Law & Order: SVU”) 
have secondary roles, but are 
ultimately purposeless vehicles 
for 
Moondog’s 
development. 
Another music icon in the cast 
was Jimmy Buffett, playing 
himself. Somehow, the idea of 
Jimmy Buffett 
partying 
with 
washed-up 
stoners on the 
west coast of 
Florida 
was 
one of the most 
realistic aspects 
of the movie.
“The 
Beach 
Bum” 
is 
the 
most agonizing 
kind of movie to 
watch. I didn’t 
totally hate it, 
but 
I 
would 
have 
enjoyed 
my experience 
more 
if 
it 
had 
been 
unambiguously 
atrocious. 
Instead, 
the 
film 
is 
the 
product of one 
pretentious writer writing about 
another 
pretentious 
writer 
and is about as impactful as a 
3 a.m. dorm room philosophy 
discussion.

Making 
a 
single 
comic 
strip, however simple the 
strip may be, is a painstaking 
process. I learned this in fifth 
grade, doodling comics in my 
workbooks and spending way 
too much time trying to get 
my characters (Kirby rip-offs 
and an OC named Bob, who 
was essentially an oval with 
Ls for legs and an isosceles 
triangle of a nose) just right. 
Now take one of those single 
comic strips — say about 
four panels — multiply it by 
over 400 and distribute it 
daily. It takes commitment, 
dedication and an extremely 
sharp drawing hand to pull 
off something like that, which 
is exactly what Canadian 
cartoonist Michael DeForge 
did with his latest work, 
“Leaving Richard’s Valley.”
“Leaving Richard’s Valley” 
takes place in this bizarro 
and bleak version of Toronto, 
one where animals can talk to 
humans. Groups of animals 
and humans form, and most of 
them turn out to be cults. The 
titular 
character, 
Richard, 
is one such cult leader. With 
his band of racoons, spiders, 
frogs and college classmates, 
he lives on a section of land 
in a public park he claims as 
his “Valley.” City officials 
can’t be bothered enough to 
throw them out. The multiple 
intertwining plots are thrown 
into motion when a group of 
four animals are kicked out 
of Richard’s Valley for trying 
to save their sick friend 
with what Richard deems as 
unpurified water. As per most 
daily comics, hijinks ensue 
and lessons are learned.
However, 
“Leaving 
Richard’s Valley” is unlike 
most daily comics. DeForge’s 
mode 
of 
distributing 
his 
comic was via Instagram — 
all 475 pages that constitute 
the recently released print 
collection can also be found on 
your phone @richardsvalley. 
While 
I’ve 
seen 
other 
Instagram artists that have 
attempted drawing (mostly) 
daily comics for however long 
a time (@tommysiegel and @
nathanwpylestrangeplanet 
come to mind), they lack 
the overarching themes and 
stories that DeForge brings to 
life, facets that bring to mind 
the best of “Peanuts” and 
“Calvin and Hobbes.”
I recently had a chance to 
interview Michael DeForge 
over 
email 
about 
social 
media, solitude and his new 
graphic novel, among other 
things. DeForge will make 
a stop in Ann Arbor at the 
Vault of Midnight on April 
13 for his international book 
tour 
promoting 
“Leaving 
Richard’s Valley.” Check out 
his words below, and perhaps 
get a chance to hear some 
different words in person 
later this week.
The Michigan Daily: You’ve 
been in the comics scene for 
quite some time now, not 
only traditional print comics, 
but also online ventures and 
even TV animation. How did 
you first get into the world of 
comics, and how would you 
reflect on your career so far 
after multiple years in the 

business?
Michael 
DeForge: 
I’ve 
been drawing comics since 
high school, but things really 
changed when Anne Koyama 
(of 
Koyama 
Press) 
first 
noticed my what I was doing. 
She took a big risk publishing 
someone 
so 
completely 
untested. In general, I owe 
a lot to people taking those 
sorts of chances on me. That 
was certainly the case with 
my job in animation, where 
I was invited to audition for 
a design position despite not 
having any formal training in 
the field. I feel very fortunate 
and I’m very grateful.
TMD: 
I’ve 
never 
been 
to Toronto — never been 
to Canada, in fact — but I 
definitely got a real sense 
of 
the 
city 
through 
the 
comic, even though “Leaving 
Richard’s Valley” presents a 
more fantastical world. How 
would 
you 
describe 
your 
approach to this, blending 
elements 
of 
fantasy 
with 
more gritty realism?
DeForge: I wanted to make 
the environment seem very 
“lived in,” so I added a lot of 
both real and imagined bits of 
Toronto history to the book. 
Hopefully, spending so much 
time hashing out those details 
helped make it feel like a real 
city. It was important that 
the characters be tethered to 
a specific place and time.
TMD: “Leaving Richard’s 
Valley” 
was 
originally 
distributed 
via 
Instagram, 
with you posting one comic 
a day for over a year. How do 
you feel about social media 
having become this new home 
for comics and illustrators, 
particularly 
Instagram 
and 
Twitter? 
Are 
there 
differences to the varying 
social media platforms that 
makes one an ideal choice for 
hosting a comic?
DeForge: 
I’ve 
always 
posted my artwork online, 
so sharing work that way has 
been pretty natural for me.
There 
are 
aspects 
to 
Twitter 
and 
Instagram 
I 
dislike 
— 
I 
particularly 
hate having our livelihoods 
be 
so 
wrapped 
up 
with 
corporations who don’t care 
about us in the slightest, and 
I miss the days when online 
platforms were a little more 
personal and customizable 
— but I also understand this 
is the primary way people 
follow me. I don’t actually 
think either website’s format 
is that ideal for hosting a 
comic, to be honest, but I feel 
sort of stuck with both for the 
time being.
TMD: 
The 
mood 
of 
“Leaving Richard’s Valley” 
is definitely a somber one, 
especially 
highlighted 
by 
the color scheme (or lack 
thereof ). Could you explain 
the stylistic choices behind 
the comic, particularly the 
black-and-white artwork?
DeForge: I like switching 
between color and black-and-
white projects so that I don’t 
get too bored with any one 
style. I think the look of the 
comic really came together 
once I figured out the collage 
elements and the photocopied 
textures. I wanted to make 
the city feel cluttered, rather 
than just being generally and 

vaguely “dirty.” It’s a very 
specific type of noise and 
mess I was trying to evoke.
TMD: Reading “Leaving 
Richard’s Valley” reminded 
me slightly of Larry Marder’s 
“Beanworld,” 
a 
comic 
I 
randomly happened upon as 
a preteen, although it seemed 
the 
connection 
existed 
mostly in my mind. What 
were your personal biggest 
inspirations and influences 
for the creation of the comic?
DeForge: 
Ha, 
I 
loved 
“Beanworld” 
as 
a 
kid! 
Berkeley Breathed’s “Bloom 
County” was a big influence 
on this comic, as well as 
on my last strip, “Sticks 
Angelica, Folk Hero.” I liked 
how it covered this broad 
community of characters so 
lovingly, and how fleshed 
out the setting felt. There’s 
obviously a “humans talking 
to 
animals” 
thing 
that’s 
present in my work a lot. I 
barely understood most of 
the jokes as a kid, since a lot 
of them were fairly topical, 
but I ate it up anyway.
TMD: I’ve read that you 
worked on “Adventure Time,” 
which I’m sure amounted to 
something like a dream job. 
What role did you play in the 
making of the show? Would 
you ever want to helm an 
animated TV series of your 
own?
DeForge: I was the props 
and effects designer, but I 
ended up doing other things 
as well — character design, 
storyboarding, concept art, 
title cards, whatever. The 
concept art I was able to 
contribute to a few episodes 
is some of the work I’m 
proudest of from my time 
there.
“Youth 
in 
Decline” 
publisher Ryan Sands and I 
were developing a show called 
“Mall Nation” for Cartoon 
Network that they ended up 
passing on. It was about the 
student body of an elementary 
school getting indefinitely 
locked inside an abandoned 
shopping mall, who are forced 
to build this new, anarchic 
society for themselves. It 
would have been fun to work 
on if it got off the ground, 
but the pitching process was 
exhausting 
and 
ultimately 
pretty 
heartbreaking, 
so 
it’s not something I’d be 
all that eager to jump into 
again unless I really had the 
right idea for it. I like being 
focused on comics.
TMD: 
How 
does 
it 
feel 
embarking 
on 
an 
international book tour to 
promote “Leaving Richard’s 
Valley”?
DeForge: Drawing comics 
can be solitary work, so 
having the opportunity to 
travel and talk to readers 
on tours is real nice. It’s 
certainly not something I 
expected I’d ever be able to 
do when I was first starting 
out.
TMD: 
What’s 
next 
for 
Michael DeForge?
DeForge: I have a shorter 
comic 
coming 
out 
from 
Koyama Press in the fall 
called “Stunt.” Aside from 
that, I’m just chipping away 
at stories that probably won’t 
be published for another two 
years or so.

GRAPHIC CONTENT SERIES

Rhythm games are a unique 
product of the video game world 
that combines music with gameplay. 
If you’ve ever played “Dance Dance 
Revolution” or “Guitar Hero,” you 
know the intense satisfaction of 
correctly dancing or playing an 
instrument to a sequence of notes 
on the screen. For being no good at 
them, I have always been addicted 
to 
that 
satisfaction; 
countless 
hours have been spent attempting 
to master the music (on medium 
difficulty at best). In 2014, I found 
my calling.
Imagine “Guitar Hero” but on the 
computer, and you had to click notes 
that showed up on the screen. That’s 
the essence of “Osu,” a game that 
challenges your rhythm and hand-
eye coordination. Each track you 
play is called a “beatmap.” Talented 
beatmappers and other dedicated 
community 
members 
work 
to 
provide quality beatmaps that 
rhythm masters play to perfection, 
competing for points and a higher 
position 
on 
the 
leaderboards. 
“Osu” is still affectionately called 
an “obscure rhythm game” by its 
community, but has grown to 14 
million registered players in its 
12-year lifespan. It’s not so obscure 
anymore, but still nowhere close to 
the popularity of “Just Dance.” Part 
of that is the challenge — it has an 
enormously high skill ceiling — but 

much of that might be attributed 
to the “Osu” community’s music of 
choice.
The 
“Osu” 
competitive 
community is built on thousands of 
beatmaps to songs that I collectively 
call “anime music.” Anime music 
consists of opening and ending 
themes to popular anime series, 
visual novels, JRPGs and other 
media connected to anime. I 
myself found “Osu” at the tail end 
of my middle school anime phase, 
attracted to both the challenge 
and the cute, enigmatic vocals — 
enigmatic for an English speaker, at 
least. I never got sick of those songs, 
spending countless hours mastering 
beatmaps deep into the night, 
thrilled to finally find a rhythm 
game I was good at.
I want to write that “at first 
glance, ‘Osu’ seems like a normal 
rhythm game,” but it’s crystal clear 
right away that it’s not an ordinary 
rhythm game. The game is deeply 
entrenched in anime culture and it 
wants you to know it. The name itself 
is a Japanese word (pronounced 
like “oss”) an expression tied to 
Japanese martial arts (i.e. karate). 
The game has a pink-haired anime 
girl for a mascot. For a time, one of 
the default beatmaps was “Tear 
Rain” by cYsmix, an electro-pop 
song with Japanese vocals that 
comes from “Touhou Project,” a 
Japanese bullet-hell shoot-em-up 
game. The default songs have since 
changed to be more culturally-
neutral electronic cuts, but the 

vast majority of ranked, playable 
beatmaps are anime music. The 
game’s ties to anime culture are 
so strong that it almost seems like 
they’re inseparable — like “Osu” 
could not be played over a song 
that wasn’t at least tangentially 
connected to anime culture.
It actually takes a closer look 
to see that “Osu” has no features 
limiting it to anime music. There’s 
nothing stopping the community 
from 
making 
beatmaps 
for 
American pop music, or any other 
genre of music that lends itself to 
a rhythm game. So how did “Osu” 
end up becoming a haven for anime 
music?
Some might guess that “Osu” is 
a Japanese game marketed in its 
own country, but that couldn’t be 
further from the truth. It’s actually 
developed in Australia, and Japan is 
only the sixth-most popular country 
for “Osu” players — America holds 
the number-one spot. Part of it is in 
the aforementioned branding: The 
game is clearly marketed towards 
a target audience of anime fans 
and Japanese culture enthusiasts 
(which are nearly synonymous at 
this point in the Western world). 
“Osu” takes a lot of stamina, so 
songs on the shorter end tend to be 
more popular. Most anime openings 
and endings are cut to 90 seconds, 
perfect for the competitive player.

Wolverines growing in mistakes

At the halfway point of its 
season, the No. 24 Michigan 
baseball team (22-8) is heating 
up at exactly the right time. 
It’s returned to the rankings. 
It took four of its first five Big 
Ten games and eight of its 
last 10 contests, a stretch that 
included a 1-0 pitchers’ duel 
victory against San Jose State, 
a 16-2 rout of Michigan State 
and a gritty come-from-behind 
series win over Minnesota last 
weekend. 
After 
a 
tough 
California 
swing where they saw their first 
four losses of the season and an 
even tougher trip to Texas — 
where they were swept by No. 
11 Texas Tech — the Wolverines 
are learning from their past 
mistakes.
Against the Red Raiders on 
March 21, it was the defense 
that had issues. Michigan gave 
up six hits and committed two 
errors, leading to six unearned 
Texas Tech runs in the fifth 
inning alone. The Red Raiders 
added another run in the bottom 
of the seventh on an error from 

sophomore catcher Joe Donovan 
and tacked on three more in the 
bottom of the eighth inning to 
take the game, 11-2. 
But 
since 
that 
trip, 
Michigan’s defense has been 
one of its strongest assets. The 
Wolverines’ 
average 
fielding 
percentage is .971, and their 
aggressive-mistakes 
mindset 
has resulted in some impressive 
plays, including several bare-
handers 
from 
sophomore 
shortstop Jack Blomgren and 
senior second baseman Ako 
Thomas. They turned three 
inning-ending 
double 
plays 
in Sunday’s 8-0 trouncing of 
Minnesota alone. 
“To be able to minimize 
(Minnesota’s) opportunities was 
a huge storyline this weekend,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Erik 
Bakich. “It’s really just playing 
good defense. That’s something 
that helps us have a good day.”
In the Dodgertown Classic, it 
was the offense that could not 
produce. After a triumphant 7-5 
win over then-No. 2 UCLA on 
March 8, the lineup could not 
find a rhythm for the Wolverines 
as USC’s pitchers stifled their 
bats and Oklahoma State got 

clutch 
hits 
when 
Michigan 
could not.
Now, though, the Wolverines’ 
clutch hitting has helped them 
to more than a few victories. 
In their Big Ten opener against 
the Spartans, they scored the 
winning runs off two fifth-
inning doubles to break the game 
open. And in Saturday’s game 
against Minnesota, Michigan 
clinched the win on a two-out, 
two-run double from Thomas in 
the bottom of the seventh.
Overall, 
heading 
into 
a 
midweek series against a strong 
Indiana State team and an away 
weekend series against archrival 
Ohio State, Michigan seems to 
be peaking just when it needs to 
be. The ghosts of baseball games 
past have yet to return to haunt 
the Wolverines, and if Michigan 
can continue to grow from past 
mistakes, the team is looking 
increasingly tough to beat.
“The challenge is just to get 
better, to play our best baseball,” 
Bakich said. “I have total faith in 
our players. If we just come with 
that mentality of competing 
and effort and energy, and if we 
bring that from the first pitch, I 
think we’ll be in great shape.”

Schalet shows poise in comebacks

Coming into Sunday, Myles 
Schalet had not lost a doubles 
match since the end of February. 
Playing with freshman Andrew 
Fenty, the team leader in both 
singles and doubles wins, the 
duo was expected to set the 
stage for the Wolverines with a 
win over No. 15 Illinois.
Instead, Schalet and Fenty 
were the first to lose their match, 
giving up an early 
3-2 lead to lose, 
6-4. 
It 
wasn’t 
their best tennis, 
and the rest of 
the team followed 
suit, with poor 
doubles play by 
No. 20 Michigan 
(13-6 overall, 4-3 
Big Ten) giving 
the 
Fighting 
Illini (13-6, 7-0) 
an early lead from which the 
Wolverines were never able to 
come back.
This made winning singles 
matches all the more important. 

But Schalet still looked sluggish 
at the beginning of his match 
and quickly fell behind, 2-5, in 
the first set. While some would 
have let a doubles loss and an 
early deficit get to their head and 
hurt their play for the rest of the 
match, Schalet is no stranger to 
these situations. Friday against 
Northwestern, he lost the first 
set and faced a match point 
down 3-5 in the second set and 
came back to win.
Sunday’s match ended in a 
similar fashion 
for 
Schalet. 
He went on to 
win 
the 
last 
five games of 
the 
first 
set 
and won the 
second set in 
a tiebreak to 
give Michigan 
its second and 
final 
singles 
point.
“I trust myself, and I always 
keep fighting and competing,” 
Schalet said. “I’m just trying to 
take care of my service game 
and get early leads when they 

are serving so I can get myself 
an opportunity to break.”
Schalet used the support of 
his teammates to get back into 
his match — and eventually 
win it. When he was down and 
noticeably upset with his play, 
his teammates continued to 
encourage him. Once Schalet 
turned it around and took 
the lead, the rest of the team 
rallied around him, and he did 
the same for them. While the 
Wolverines ended up losing, 
seeing their captain come back 
motivated 
them. 
Freshman 
Patrick Maloney, who was the 
only other player to win a match, 
played with a similar intensity.
“One of the ways I’m always 
able to get back is because of the 
way we play as a team,” Schalet 
said. 
“My 
teammates 
are 
always there, and we’re playing 
together. I’m not playing by 
myself out there, so that helps 
a lot.”
But while Schalet was able to 
bail himself out by improving 
his play as the match went on, he 
said he wanted to start matches 
playing his strongest tennis.

“I have to get better at 
starting 
matches 
better,” 
Schalet said. “I can’t rely on me 
coming back every time because 
a better player is just going to 
get on me.”
Added Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg: “I think he needs to 
focus a little better through the 
match, but when he gets down 
he gives everything”
While Schalet was not playing 
at his best early on in matches 
this weekend, his ability to fight 
and his drive helped him put 
losses behind him and lead the 
team by doing what he does best 
— winning points.

‘M’ men’s tennis splits weekend

The doubles point proved to 
be the make-or-break factor for 
the No. 20 Michigan men’s tennis 
team in its weekend split.
On Friday, winning the doubles 
point set the tone early for a 5-2 
win over Northwestern.
But on Saturday, a doubles loss 
foreshadowed a 4-2 defeat to No. 
15 Illinois.
“The doubles point is so big 
and we need to play better,” said 
Michigan coach Adam Steinberg. 
“For us, we should take much more 
pride in our doubles. Our record in 
doubles should be better than it is.”
On Friday, the team clinched 
two out of the three doubles 
matches 
after 
impressive 
performances from the duos of 
freshman Andrew Fenty and 
senior Myles Schalet, and junior 
Connor Johnston and freshman 
Patrick Maloney.
With the crucial doubles point 
under its belt, Michigan proceeded 
to win four of six matches in 
the singles round. Sophomore 
Mattias Siimar impressed with a 
6-2, 6-3 straight-set outing over 
Northwestern’s Antonioni Fasano 
to propel the Wolverines to a win 
on Friday.
The second half of the home 
series against Illinois on Sunday 
was a different story.
The team of Fenty and Schalet, 
along with the team of sophomore 
Harrison 
Brown 
and 
Siimar 
dropped the first two matches, 
leaving 
the 
third 
unfinished 
and handing Illinois the doubles 
victory.
Steinberg felt that his squad 
did not execute well on first serve, 
an important aspect of doubles 
because it enables a team to hold 
serve most of the time during a 
match. 
Though the team trailed from 
the start, the competition was 
still close late. Michigan trailed by 
one point with a chance to tie and 
potentially win with Fenty and 
Johnston left to play.
Johnston would ultimately fall 
to Illinois’ Keenan Mayo in a close 
third set, clinching a 4-2 victory 
for the Illini. Illinois players 
stormed the court in joy, while 

the Wolverines looked on with 
noticeable disappointment.
“We just had leads everywhere. 
We threw them away up a set and 
a break at six, up a set and break at 
two,” Steinberg said. “We have to 
finish those.”
Siimar, Johnston and senior 
Gabe Tishman all held leads 
during their matches, but all 
eventually lost in three sets. It was 
a pattern that Steinberg felt derived 
from a mid-match mentality — a 
misguided one.
“I think they think about 
winning and that they don’t focus 
on the plan ahead, the task,” 
Steinberg said. “They get so results-
oriented when they’re ahead. It’s 
just the wrong thinking.”
Despite 
a 
disappointing 
afternoon, Michigan had strong 
showings 
from 
Schalet 
and 
Maloney, the team’s only two 
players to win in the singles round. 
Schalet’s day was particularly 
impressive, as he led a valiant 
comeback from down three games 
to win the first set and eventually 
the match in straight sets 7-5, 7-6 
(5). Steinberg said that he believed 
it was one of his better wins of 

the season, considering the deficit 
Schalet overcame.
Maloney also had a short, yet 
impressive, outing, beating his 
opponent 6-3, 6-2.
“He’s 
doing 
unbelievable,” 
Steinberg said. “You know, when 
you lose a doubles point you don’t 
want to go down 2-0, you want to 
get it one all, and he got us on the 
board so that was great for him.”
Still, Steinberg demonstrated 
some frustration with how his 
team started and finished the 
match.
“We do a great job when we’re 
down, but we don’t do a great job 
when we’re up,” Steinberg said. 
“It’s just glaring, it happens a lot 
to us. So we need to find a way to 
finish more.”
Schalet agreed with his coach 
and mentioned that changing the 
trajectory of their season starts 
with how the Wolverines train.
“When we play sets in practice 
and really make it like a match, not 
just going through the motions, it 
takes a lot of focus,” Schalet said. 
“When you are playing a good 
team like Illinois, they’re going to 
really fight when they’re down.”

Senior Myles Schalet clinched victories against both Northwestern and Illinois over the weekend as the Michigan men’s tennis team split matches.

Rowing sweeps weekend regatta

Over 
the 
weekend, 
the 
Michigan rowing team was 
dominant.
Michigan was so dominant, 
in fact, that none of its boats 
lost a race. The sixth-ranked 
Wolverines 
swept 
three 
ACC opponents — including 
two 
ranked 
teams 
— 
on 
Lake Monticello in Virginia. 
Michigan dispatched No. 10 
Virginia during morning races 
and defeated No. 17 Syracuse 
along with Duke during the 
afternoon session of racing. The 
wins provided a promising start 
to the spring season.
“Any time you can win races 
against really good programs 
like we raced today, that’s a 
good thing,” said Michigan 
coach Mark Rothstein. “We 
were pleased to be able to come 
away with some really good 
victories, and we’re excited to 
get faster, grow and improve.”

contributed to the weekend’s 
highlights. The first varsity 
eight 
beat 
Virginia 
by 
7.3 
seconds with a time of 6:30.5, 
then came back and topped 
Syracuse by 4.3 seconds and 
Duke in the afternoon, timing 
6:26.5.
The second varsity eight boat 
also won both its 
races, 
although 
they were much 
closer than the 
first 
eight’s. 
After 
quickly 
beating 
the 
Cavaliers 
in 
6:36.0 
by 
4.7 
seconds, 
the 
Wolverines 
inched ahead of 
the Blue Devils 
in the afternoon race in 6:35.3, 
by a mere eight-tenths of a 
second.
Additionally, the first varsity 
four continued undefeated as it 
won by more than 10 seconds 
in the morning (7:18.6) and 
more than seven seconds in the 

afternoon (7:24.2).
The second varsity four also 
won both its races, with a close 
finish in 7:23.6 by 4.2 seconds 
and a comfortable win in 7:33.4 
by 11.8 seconds. The third varsity 
four won by relaxed margins 
as well, including the biggest 
win of the day — a 19.0-second 
victory against 
Virginia 
in 
7:29.2.
“Top 
to 
bottom all the 
boats really had 
bright 
spots,” 
Rothstein 
said. “They all 
showed 
some 
things 
that 
needed 
to 
be 
improved.
“We’re in a good spot, but the 
biggest thing that we are seeing 
right now is these athletes are 
excited to get back to practice. 
Regardless of times, regardless 
of race results, they want to get 
back to work and keep getting 
faster. That’s exciting to see.”

The stadium was silent.
There were three balls, two 
strikes and two outs in the bottom 
of the seventh. Indiana clung to a 
narrow 6-5 lead.
Senior 
designated 
player 
Mackenzie Nemitz stood at the 
plate, one pitch away from a 
comeback win or a letdown loss to 
end a long series against Indiana.
One crack of a bat and the game 
ended. Wrapping up the weekend 
sweep over a strong Hoosiers 
team, the senior swatted a double 
into right field, and the stadium 
erupted.
“We had to get it done,” 
said senior first baseman Alex 
Sobczak. “There’s nothing else to 
it. The scoreboard read that they 
were two ahead and we had to get 
it done to get people around.”
Going into the bottom of the 
seventh inning, Michigan had 
trailed for the first time in 14 
games since starting the home 
season at Alumni Field. The 
Wolverines faced a two-run deficit 
with three outs to solve it. And the 
senior class lead the charge.
Down by two runs with an 
early out on sophomore Natalia 
Rodriguez’s popup to center field, 
senior second baseman Faith 
Canfield entered the batter’s box. 
In her three previous at-bats 
Sunday against No. 3 right-hander 
Emily Goodin, Canfield didn’t 
tally a hit.
But she needed one in the 
seventh inning, and she got it. 
On the second pitch of the at-bat, 
Canfield hit a home run to center 
field that shrunk the gap to one run. 
Now down 7-6, senior outfielder 
Natalie Peters hit a double to keep 
the Wolverines’ hopes alive before 
Goodin 
intentionally 
walked 
Sobczak, who had hit a home run 
against the pitcher earlier in the 
contest.

And then Nemitz stepped up.
She hadn’t reached base since 
her first-inning triple off a fielding 
error. She hadn’t hit her best all 
weekend, doing little to maintain 
her designated player spot. But 
Nemitz knew she needed to 
produce.
“I was shaking so hard, but I 
was honestly so in the zone that I 
didn’t even know how many runs 
we needed,” Nemtiz said. “It was 
mostly about keeping my mind 
clear. Nothing was really going 
on besides, ‘You’re going to get it 
done.’ ”
Five pitches later, she did just 
that. All eyes turned to Nemitz as 
she lifted her bat, pulled it back and 
watched the pitch sail. And then 
she knocked it. The anticipatory 
stadium shifted to jubilation. 
Peters 
and 
Sobczak 
sprinted 
forward, and the disappointment 
of Michigan’s looming loss was 

replaced with elation.
“I got to second and was sitting 
on the base like ‘Okay I’m not 
getting out’ and then I see Alex hit 
home plate and I looked up and we 
won,” Nemitz said. “From behind, 
you’ve got to just get it done.”
Nemitz’s cap to the senior-led 
comeback inning signified their 
role all season leading the team 
offensively.
“This game is the best game I’ve 
ever been a part of,” Sobczak said. 
“After I hit home, there’s no better 
feeling. It’s such a high.”
It was quite an inning and an 
even better way for the seniors 
to end the tumultuous game 
collectively.
“It’s just awesome to see all of 
the hard work pay off in one little 
inning,” Nemitz said. “That was 
just a team win. Alex came to me 
and hugged me and I was just like 
‘I did that for you.’ ”

With a rejuvenated offense, Michigan continues to dominate Big Ten play, extending its win streak to 15 games
Softball Surge

Up 4-2 in the third inning of 
Sunday’s slate against Indiana, 
the Michigan softball team 
entered a lull. Sophomore left-
hander Meghan Beaubien took 
over for freshman right-hander 
Alex Storako in the circle, and 
the Hoosiers started to score. 
With two consecutive batters 
reaching base for Indiana, a 
player hit by a pitch and a walk, 
the Wolverines scrambled.
The result wasn’t pretty.
A triple sank Michigan into a 
deficit, one that was worsened 
by 
freshman 
Lexie 
Blair’s 
fielding error in right field. 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
had one main piece of advice for 
Beaubien.
“(Beaubien) didn’t have good 
energy,” Hutchins said. “I said, 

‘Our team is feeding off you 
right now,’ and it’s our team’s 
job to pick her up, but she also 
just needed to have better 
energy.”
With a tough first two games 
against 
Indiana 
on 
Friday 
and 
Saturday, 
Beaubien 
had 
already pitched 
10 
innings 
heading into the 
Sunday 
series 
finale. 
But 
more 
so 
than 
the fatigue, her 
attitude in the 
circle 
guided 
her play — and 
subsequently 
her team’s.
“She’s 
fit 
and 
she 
has 
the 
ability,” 
Hutchins 
said 
Saturday. “I didn’t think she 
was throwing nearly like she 
did yesterday and I don’t think 
it’s a fatigue thing. I think it’s a 
mindset.”
Beaubien 
finished 
the 
inning — and threw three more 
scoreless ones after — but that 
fourth inning meant more than 
a slip-up.
Sunday’s game wasn’t the 
first when the Wolverines let a 
few bad plays spiral and affect 
the entire team’s attitude for 
innings. 
They’ve 
said 
that 
repeatedly, and they’re not 
wrong. The team attitude can 
trigger energy slips that cause 
poor innings. But that’s sports.
Just as momentum can affect 
a team negatively, it can also 
help break a string of bad plays 
and facilitate a last-minute 
comeback.
And Sunday, it did just that 
for Michigan.
Down 
6-5 
after 
her 
teammates’ timely hits earlier 
in the inning, senior designated 
player 
Mackenzie 
Nemitz 
walked out of the dugout with 

her teammates cheering at her 
back. Five pitches later, she 
smashed a walk-off double 
into center field and ended the 
series on a high.
Something 
changed 
from 
the fourth inning to Nemitz’s 
at-bat, 
and 
it 
wasn’t 
talent 
coming from the 
dugout.
“We were all 
one heartbeat,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“Every kid in 
that dugout was 
on 
point 
and 
that’s how you 
win big, because 
you’re 
playing 
for a lot more than just today.”
Added senior first baseman 
Alex Sobczak: “I went in to 
those pitches and was on the 
line and ready for her to make 
a mistake …There’s no better 
feeling.”
So 
what 
changed 
for 
Michigan?
Nemitz 
attributed 
her 
success to a heightened sense 
of focus. Hutchins has pointed 
in the past to momentum and 
following up on teammates’ 
success. Sobczak said sheer 
discipline makes mental acuity 
a necessity in situations like 
that.
Regardless 
of 
why 
the 
Wolverines could shift their 
mentality, Michigan made the 
adjustment, and going into 
conference road games and a 
series against Ohio State, the 
Wolverines may need to flip the 
switch again.
“We really needed to keep 
ourselves in the game, and 
(Beaubien) found a way to 
do it,” Hutchins said. “Every 
inning, we can win these 
games. I really credit the kids 
in the dugout for keeping the 
energy up.”

Players, coaches adjusting to 
Josh Gattis’ new style of offense

In his meetings with the 
offense, Josh Gattis preaches 
a simple strategy: Just play 
football.
“Basic things you would 
wanna 
do,” 
said 
junior 
Ben Mason. “Make a block 
downfield that could open up 
a touchdown or lower your 
shoulder to get that extra yard. 
Knowing the situation. Just 
different things like that, he’s 
really made that come to life in 
our offense.”
Much has been made of the 
new style Gattis is bringing 
to the Michigan football team 
— from the trendy hashtag 
“#SpeedinSpace” to talks of a 
no-huddle offense. But those 
pieces aren’t going to fall 
into place immediately, and 
one of the main emphases in 
spring ball has been getting 
the players up to speed on the 
new system. That includes not 
just the spread concepts Gattis, 
the 
newly-minted 
offensive 
coordinator, 
has 
promised, 
but smaller things like making 
basic 
plays 
and 
developing 
instincts.
And 
while 
most 
of 
the 
emphasis has been on how 
the new style impacts the 
quarterbacks 
and 
receivers 
— who, by all indications, 
will 
become 
much 
more 
involved under Gattis — it’s 
an adjustment for everyone on 
offense.
Without huddles, it’s up to 
the players to know concepts 
like the back of their hands and 
to have a greater awareness of 
everyone on the field and their 
jobs.
“We’re 
looking 
to 
the 
sidelines trying to figure out 
what we’ve got,” said senior 
running back Tru Wilson. “It’s 
a lot of memorization. … You’ve 
gotta know the pass concepts. 
Now we don’t have tags telling 
us what we’ve gotta do. We 
gotta know what the receivers 
are doing and where we fit in, 

what our depth is. We’ve also 
gotta know our protection so 
we also gotta know what our 
linemen are doing, our footwork 
and everything — everything 
was so crucial.”
Pieces of Gattis’ system are 
things the Wolverines have 
done before, but as the spring 
season has progressed, they’ve 
gotten further along in knowing 
not just what his concepts are, 
but the way he thinks and the 
way he attacks.
Now, everyone has more to 
do and more to learn. According 
to running backs coach Jay 
Harbaugh, guys who used to be 
buried on the depth chart have 
been able to learn quicker than 
they did in the old West Coast 
offense run by Michigan coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
and 
former 
passing 
game 
coordinator 
Pep Hamilton — and have put 
themselves in a better position 
because of it.
But for players entrenched in 
that old system, it’s adapt or get 
left behind. There’s a lot that’s 
new, but this isn’t a team to shy 
away from a challenge.
“I knew it was coming and I 
was excited for it,” Wilson said. 
“And I think everybody has that 
same mindset, willing to learn, 

open-mindedness 
and 
we’re 
seeing it come to fruition on the 
field with the offense working 
against the defense, and it’s 
really exciting to see.”
On the field, anyone thinking 
the offense will have a complete 
upheaval will be disappointed. 
Jay Harbaugh noted that the 
Wolverines are still a run-
first team and that the actual 
runs they’re doing aren’t much 
different 
from 
before. 
But 
there, too, Gattis has presented 
things Michigan was doing 
before, plus more. There’s a 
new emphasis on getting the 
running backs involved in the 
passing game with screens and 
playing at a quicker tempo.
For 
the 
offensive 
line, 
meanwhile, 
things 
haven’t 
been much different — at 
least not according to senior 
guard Michael Onwenu, who 
maintained that his role was 
still, “Blocking the, whatever 
pass or play, or whatever.”
But he, too, recognizes that 
things are different with the 
Wolverines now, and he, too, 
has embraced it.
“It’s 
cool 
and 
whatnot,” 
Onwenu 
said. 
“Change 
is 
inevitable, 
so 
you’re 
comfortable with anything.”

Wolverines take first loss of season

In a battle of the Big Ten’s 
two undefeated titans, one 
team was bound to leave 
College Park with its first 
loss of the season on Saturday 
night.
When the No. 7 Michigan 
women’s lacrosse team (3-1 Big 
Ten, 13-0 overall) left town, 
Maryland stood alone atop the 
conference. The Wolverines 
fell 14-3 to the second-ranked 
Terrapins (4-0, 14-0), dropping 
their first game of the season 
and 
snapping 
a 
15-game 
winning streak dating back to 
last year’s campaign. 
Sophomore 
midfielder 
Maggie Kane rifled a shot from 
the left side of the net to give 
the Wolverines a 1-0 lead 33 
seconds in, and for 10 minutes 
it 
appeared 
that 
Hannah 

Nielsen’s squad was on its way 
to a potential upset, routinely 
disrupting 
Maryland’s 
offensive rhythm early while 
senior goalie Mira Shane made 
a series of saves up close.
Just 
five 
minutes 
later, 
though, Michigan found itself 
in a 3-1 hole after the Terrapins 
tacked 
on 
three 
goals 
in 
five minutes. After a media 
timeout, 
the 
scoring 
blitz 
only continued, as Maryland 
found the back of the net five 
more times in the next two 
minutes and thirty seconds, 
dashing the Wolverines’ hopes 
of continuing their 13-game 
winning streak.
“We were starved of the 
ball a bit,” Nielsen said. “(We) 
couldn’t win too many draw 
controls 
tonight. 
We 
were 
playing a little bit sensitive and 
playing on our heels a little 
bit.”

The 
Terrapins’ 
scoring 
run was keyed by Michigan 
penalties. 
With 
the 
game 
still in reach, the Wolverines 
committed 
two 
fouls 
and 
picked up a yellow card to give 
Maryland three free position 
opportunities. 
While 
the 
Terrapins only converted one 
of these chances, they retained 
possession in their zone and 
convert twice on easy scoring 
tries en route to an 8-1 halftime 
edge.
The 
Michigan 
offense 
also struggled to take care of 
the ball, failing to get a shot 
attempt for over five minutes 
during 
Maryland’s 
lengthy 
scoring run. As the game wore 
on, it began to appear as if the 
Wolverines were not prepared 
for 
its 
road 
tilt 
against 
one of the nation’s biggest 
powerhouses. While they have 
answered many challenges on 
its way to a 13-0 start, this one 
proved too daunting.
“(Maryland is) a very skilled 
team top to bottom, and we 
knew we had to come in here 
and play our very best to beat 
them,” Nielsen said. “The effort 
was there and we fought hard 
till the end but we didn’t make 
the most of our opportunities.”
In the second half, the 
Wolverines 
played 
with 
a 
different type of fire, gaining 
more offensive opportunities. 
Molly 
Garrett 
answered 
a 
Maryland snipe with a goal of 
her own to cut the lead to 9-2, 
but that would be as close as 
Michigan would get for the rest 
of the contest. It had two free 
position chances early in the 
second half, but were unable 
to convert and chip away at the 
Terrapins’ lead.
“We needed to bury them,” 
Nielsen said, “but we’ll go 
back to work, get a little better 
on them, and hopefully we’ll 
improve for our next game.”
While Nadine Stewart netted 
a goal to cut the score to 12-3, 
it proved to be too little too 
late, as Maryland coasted until 
the final whistle with a 14-3 
victory and sole possession of 
the Big Ten’s top spot.
