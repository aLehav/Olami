Days after 

candidate’s visit, 
daughter tours 

treatment facilities 

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

FLINT - Chelsea Clinton, 

Democratic 
presidential 

candidate 
Hillary 
Clinton’s 

daughter, followed her mother’s 
path with a visit to Flint on 
Thursday. While there, she 
toured the Hurley Children’s 
Center 
and 
the 
United 

Association Local 370, the local 
section of the plumbing and 
pipefitting union.

Clinton’s trip comes shortly 

after Clinton’s visit to the city 
last Sunday, during which she 
met with community leaders 
and 
addressed 
patrons 
at 

House of Prayer Missionary 
Baptist Church.

Chelsea Clinton has been 

campaigning for her mother 
since 
January. 
Thursday’s 

visit 
occurred 
in 
advance 

of the Democratic debate in 
Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin 
that 

evening.

While at the hospital, she met 

with Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, 
the 
doctor 
whose 
findings 

about lead levels forced the 
state government to address 
the crisis. On Wednesday she 
also met with Flint Mayor 
Karen Weaver in Washington 
D.C. earlier in the week. 

Chelsea Clinton said her 

Flint visit was motivated by her 
interest in understanding what 
the city’s leaders need as the 
crisis evolves.

“I really came to Flint today 

to listen to Mayor Weaver, to 
Dr. Mona, to the people here, 
the plumbers and pipe fitters,” 
she said. “To know what more 
those of us who are not here 
can do to support the work 
that they now know needs to 
happen. What they need now 
is different from what they 
needed a few weeks ago.”

Clinton said the city now 

has enough bottled water, but

Nursing 
Prof. 
Robert 

Stephenson 
on 
Wednesday 

led a session on navigating 
conversations 
about 
HIV 

status.

The 
session, 
“HIV

Sexpertise series and aimed to 
help students utilize campus 
resources and how to get 
involved in advocacy groups.

HIV, 
which 
stands 
for 

human 
immunodeficiency 

virus, can lead to the acquired 
immunodeficiency syndrome, 
or AIDS. AIDS patients have a 
compromised immune system, 
making them more susceptible 
to infections and diseases that 
people with working immune 
systems can usually fight off.

In the United States alone, 

more than 1.2 million people are 
infected with HIV, and one out

Games work to 

separate fact from 

fiction, reduce 

stigmas 

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

A sex-themed carnival on the 

second floor of Michigan League 
drew a full crowd of students 
Thursday 
night, 
welcoming 

students to “Come one, come 
all.” At the carnival, attendees 
could play games to win raffle 
prizes, eat candied apples and 
learn about sexuality and sexual 
health on campus.

The carnival, part of a three-

day 
Sexpertise 
conference 

hosted by the University Health 
Service, aimed to reduce stigma 

about 
sexual 
identity 
and 

experience 
among 
students. 

Public Health graduate student 
Tahiya 
Alam, 
who 
helped 

organize the event, said the 
group hoped to engage students 
in discussions on topics they 
may not think about often.

“We know that there are 

certain realities in the student 
population 
and 
there’s 
not 

always 
access 
to 
safe 
sex 

information,” she said. “Also, 
it’s just a fun way to interact 
with the multitude of different 
sources of great knowledge 
we have on campus. It helps 
students find out what they’re 
interested in and what they’re 
not interested in.”

The 
conference 
included 

multiple 
speakers 
and 

showcased presentations on a 
wide range of topics including 
sexuality 
research 
and 

stigma attached to HIV/AIDS 
diagnoses. The carnival aimed 
to combine those experiences as 
a capstone event.

“We 
want 
to 
basically 

cement down everything that 
they’ve heard throughout the 
conference, some of the things 
that our sex educators have 
really been taught throughout 
the year, and have them interact 
with 
that 
information 
in 

different ways and learn,” Alam 
said. “Learning happens both 
visually, orally and auditory-
wise so this carnival is looking 
to stimulate all those senses 
and learn a little bit more about 
sexual health.”

The carnival, Alam said, was 

meant to prompt even more 
open conversation about sex.

“Anyone who is in sex health 

education aims to dispel stigma

Speakers discuss 
sexuality in the 
media, human 

trafficking

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

Students gathered in the 

Michigan League for the final 
three sessions of Sexpertise 
— a three-day long University 
Health 
Service-sponsored 

conference 
to 
engage 
the 

community in discussion about 
sexuality and relationships — 
on Thursday. Three keynote 
speakers 
aimed 
to 
address 

stereotypes, stigmas and myths 
in relation to sex.

Stigma and Sexuality:
The evening kicked off with 

an engaging start. Dr. Terri 
Conley, professor of psychology 
and 
women’s 
studies, 

challenged 
several 
popular 

myths surrounding gender and 
relationship differences that 
have been reinforced culturally 
over time.

The first slide, in simple blue 

font, read, “Women naturally 
dislike casual sex.” Conley 
explained that this first myth 
is based on the assumption that 
there is something biological or 
genetic that prevents females 
from 
enjoying 
unattached 

sexual activity. Conley said 
her own research, however, 
debunks this myth.

“The 
most 
important 

predictor for both women and

Panel looks at 

representation in 
traditional media

By BRANDON SUMMERS-

MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michi-

gan’s School of Social Work 
held a day-long event Thursday 
focused on engaging partici-

pants on strides made by mem-
bers of the Black community 
and its allies in the digital age.

#UMBlackout, held in Rack-

ham Graduate School, featured 
a panel discussion, several 
keynote speakers and multiple 
workshop sessions for an audi-
ence of more than 50 students.

The day began with a key-

note address from Dr. Mark 
Anthony Neal, Duke University 
African and African American 
Studies professor, who spoke 

on the relationship between 
young Black Americans and 
traditional media outlets. Neal 
said he believes this group is 
turning away from traditional 
media to express their senti-
ments of social change through 
mediums like Twitter and 
other social media platforms.

He elaborated on the shift 

through citing differences in 
how young African Americans 
reacted to the death of Michael 
Brown and the way he was por-

trayed in mass media. Brown, 
who was shot by police in Fer-
guson, Mo. in August 2014, was 
a catalyst for the Black Lives 
Matter movement and sparked 
a national conversation on 
police brutality.

Young people reacted to 

Brown’s death, Neal said, by 
creating an online movement 
with the hashtag #IfThey-
GunnedMeDown.

needs volunteers for services 
to help distribute the water to 
those who are unable to go to 
pick up sites.

Clinton, who has a 16-month-

old daughter and is currently 
pregnant with her second child, 
said, as a mother, the plight of 
Flint is particularly poignant, 
as 
she 
could 
not 
imagine 

seeing her child poisoned by 
something citizens naturally 
put their trust in.

“The idea that my child 

could 
have 
been 
poisoned 

— that I could have lost my 
child — I think that should be 
inconceivable to any mother,” 
she said. “I hope that you 
wouldn’t have to be a mother to 
feel the moral outrage of what 
has happened.”

Over 
the 
past 
months, 

multiple 
state 
and 
federal 

efforts have been undertaken to 
address the crisis, which began 
began after the city switched 
from Detroit city water to using 
the Flint River as their primary 
source. Following the switch in 
April 2014, residents began to 

notice a change in the water’s 
quality as well as adverse 
health affects like hair loss and 
rotted teeth. 

Most recently, Gov. Rick 

Snyder (R) recently released 
his budget proposal, which 
allocates $195 million for Flint 
aid.

According 
to 
Clinton, 

Weaver said the proposal is a 
start to address the crisis, but 
more needs to be done. She 
emphasized that the opinions 
of the leaders in Flint are the 
ones that need to be listened to.

“She 
thinks 
it’s 
a 
good 

beginning but it’s not enough,” 
Clinton said. “Mayor Weaver, 
Dr. Mona, their opinions are 
the ones that matter. The rest 
of us should be following what 
those on the front lines say they 
need.”

Marcus 
Eubanks, 
a 
UA 

member, said he appreciates 
Clinton’s efforts to help the 
citizens of Flint.

“I thinks it’s cool,” he said. 

“It’s even better to have people 
come 
out 
and 
show 
their 

support and show that they 
can’t scoop this under the rug. 
To have someone actually going 
back for us, I think that’s cool.”

Savitch charged 

for damages 
caused at ski 
resort last year 

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

A fourth member of the 

now-disbanded 
fraternity 

Sigma Alpha Mu has been 
sentenced 
due 
to 
actions 

taken in the destruction of the 
Treetops Resort in Gaylord 
in 2015, according to a report 

from 
the 
Gaylord 
Herald 

Times.

Benjamin 
Savitch, 
the 

sentenced brother, admitted 
to kicking out ceiling tiles 
while the fraternity was at 
the resort. The vandalism 
at the resort, involving both 
SAM and the Sigma Delta Tau 
sorority from the University 
of 
Michigan, 
caused 
an 

estimated over $400,000 in 
damage during their January 
ski trip. Savitch marks the 
sixth SAM member to be 
charged 
by 
prosecutors 

for causing the damage at 
Treetops, and the fourth to be 

sentenced.

Savitch was sentenced for 

a 
misdemeanor 
charge 
of 

malicious destruction of a 
building of less than $200 on 
Jan. 22. Savitch was given a 
one-year probation, 100 hours 
of community service, court 
fines and a restitution costing 
him up to $5,000. This number 
has the potential to change 
should 
more 
defendants 

come forward and become 
sentenced for their roles in the 
destruction of the resort.

Prior 
to 
Savitch’s 

sentencing, 
University 

alums 
Daniel 
Orleans, 

Matthew Vlasic and Jesse 
Krumholz 
were 
the 
other 

former members to receive 
charges. All received similar 
sentencing 
of 
community 

service hours, court fines and 
restitution charges.

Otsego County Prosecutor 

Michael 
Rola 
plans 
to 

charge another member of 
the fraternity according to 
the Herald, but information 
regarding their identity has 
yet to be released. Treetops 
has also filed a civil lawsuit 
against SAM and SDT, seeking 
wdefendants. The suit is still 
pending.

#IfTheyGunnedMeDown, 
understanding that if they 
were in Mike Brown’s shoes, 
media might use a certain kind 
of portrait of them that fit into 
this criminalized narrative,” 
Neal said.

Amber Williams, primary 

event organizer and Social 
Work graduate student, said 
#UMBlackout was conceived 
as a space where community 
organizers and scholars could 
have an intellectual space cen-
tered around digital media 
and its importance to current 
Black activism. Williams said 
the event was meant to address 
both local and national issues 
of inclusion, access, climate, 
police brutality and violence 
against the blackk LGBTQ 
community.

“(#UMBlackout) is relevant 

because of what you see hap-
pening on our own campus,” 
Williams said. “It’s really a 
response to what we see hap-
pening.”

Following Ned’s presenta-

tion, audience members broke 

into 
groups 
for 
workshop 

sessions, one of which prac-
ticed creating a social justice 
hashtag in response to a fic-
tional event.

Community organizer and 

educator Zellie Imani, who 
led the hashtag workshop, 
discussed the importance of 
the Black community’s online 
presence and how collective 
action online can’t be met 
with police brutality as it can 
in person.

“It doesn’t matter if you left 

the hood per se,” Imani said. 
“Black bodies are never safe 
from state violence.”

In a talk later that day, 

social activist Kim Katrin 
Milan spoke about how the 
Black community uses social 
media as an outlet, and how 
they find solace in an online 
community. Milan mentioned 
a tweet she saw on her feed 
discussing the reality of Black 
History Month as celebration 
of Black firsts as merely being 
an example of Black Ameri-
cans assimilating into white 
spaces.

“We’ve been doctors for, I 

don’t know, several thousand 
years?” Milan said. “We’re not 

new to this, you know? And 
it’s really important that those 
things are framed in that kind 
of context.”

Milan said she felt relief 

when she saw that tweet 
because 
it 
expressed 
how 

she felt while being unable to 
articulate the idea herself.

“It was only when I saw 

this and read this when I was 
like, ‘Right, you totally put 
into words something that I’ve 
been trying to express,’ ” she 
said.

After the talk, participants 

broke into groups for a second 
round of workshops, including 
a discussion focused on the 
#BBUM movement and social 
media’s role in Black activism 
at the University.

History graduate student 

Austin 
McCoy 
said 
social 

media was important for Black 
students at the University to 
engage with one another and 
find support. This push online 
eventually culminated in the 
#BBUM movement.

“You can frame your issue 

or build your narrative or tell 
a story using social media,” 
McCoy said. “Using social 
media gives everyone a role to 

play in your movement.”

LSA senior Rolly Abiola 

said she wanted to attend 
#UMBlackout 
because 
she 

knew it would affirm her 
intersectionality of identities.

“Going 
to 
school 
here, 

things can get very difficult,” 
Abiola said. “I very rarely get 
to attend events that affirm 
vital aspects of my identity.”

Abiola said she would walk 

away from the event feeling 
she has the opportunity to live 
a life true to herself, and she 
hoped her peers would under-
stand that they are important 
individuals.

“Their way of seeing them-

selves, their way of acting, 
their way of behaving, their 
way of moving is just as impor-
tant regardless of what any-
body says,” Abiola said.

Abiola added that she hopes 

the University fosters an envi-
ronment where events like 
#UMBlackout are more com-
mon and prominent.

“If you don’t give us space 

to flourish, if the University 
doesn’t take it upon them-
selves to create room for us, 
they are stifling us,” she said.

with HIV do not know that they 
are infected.

During his talk, Stephenson 

pointed out that young people 
— including college students — 

might not necessarily have HIV 
prevention or testing on the top of 
their priority list since there are 
other aspects in their lives to keep 
them busy. Though the University 
Health Service currently offers 
free confidential HIV tests for 
University of Michigan students 
— the test costs $20 for others — 
the students may not utilize the 
resource.

“Is (HIV prevention or testing) 

a priority for young people?” 
Stephenson asked. “What about 
other priorities — school, getting 
good grades and planning what 
to eat?”

Stephenson said addressing 

some of those other priorities 
might encourage young people 
to prioritize HIV prevention 
or testing, an approach called 
the “life skills approach.” The 
approach focuses on developing 
and honing various practical 
skills, such as decision-making, 
problem-solving 
and 
critical 

thinking, in young people to then 
educate them about issues such as 

HIV. 

Stephenson said the approach 

may 
help 
“sort 
out” 
other 

problems the young people have 
so they can focus on dealing with 
sexuality issues, such as HIV 
testing and relationships.

“If you sort your life out, 

you are more likely to get HIV 
testing,” Stephenson said.

Stephenson 
also 
discussed 

iCON, a website for youth in 
the LGBTQ community to find 
resources in Southeast Michigan 
about various issues related to 
their sexuality, such as HIV 
prevention and testing, legal 
counsel and coming out to family 
and friends. Stephenson is the 
co-director of the Center for 
Sexuality and Health Disparities, 
the organization that developed 
iCON. iCON is tailored for the 
user’s unique status on gender, 
sexual 
orientation 
and 
HIV 

status. 

Brentney Wilson, an Eastern 

Michigan 
University 
student 

who attended the session, said 

she found iCON “fascinating” 
and liked how research on other 
topics that are not immediately 
related to HIV research were 
used to address the HIV issue in 
young people.

“How they are using other 

research to segue into research 
on HIV — I thought that was 
clever,” Wilson said. “HIV is a 
very touchy subject, so it can be 
very hard to do talk about HIV 
with people.”

Sexpertise 
Director 
Laura 

McAndrew 
said 
an 
open, 

honest discussion of sexuality 
is important because sexuality 
can greatly influence a person’s 
happiness and wellness as it is not 
just about sexually transmitted 
diseases or pregnancy.

“Sexual health is part of one’s 

overall health,” McAndrew said. 
“Sexual health includes having 
a 
positive 
relationship 
with 

your sexuality, feeling positive 
about your sexual orientation 
and having a pleasurable sexual 
interaction.”

Law School student Katie Reyzis speaks about sex trafficking from a legal perspective at the eighth annual Sexpertise at 
the Michigan League on Thursday. 

and trying to communicate that 
‘whatever you want is great 
for you and I want to help you 
navigate that sort of thing,’ ” she 
said. “So, some people might not 
even be interested in sex and 
that’s perfectly all right too and 
so we try to explore all of those 
different identities.”

The games and activities at the 

carnival were named as puns on 
terms associated with sex. One 
such game was “Quickies,” in 
which participants were asked 
to sort out myths and facts about 
sex.

The host of the activity, LSA 

freshman Ciara Hancock, said 
she was surprised by how little 
people knew about sex and how 
difficult it was for participants to 
separate fact from fiction.

“There’s a lot of information 

out there, but that doesn’t make 
it good information,” she said. 

“Some of the littler ones that 
don’t seem very important and 
seem kind of common sense, a 
lot of people are finding (what) 
they 
fundamentally 
thought 

they knew isn’t true and it’s a big 
surprise about some things that 
they just don’t know the basics 
about.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Sareena 

Kamath, who attended the event, 
said she was impressed by variety 
of sexual health issues addressed 
at the carnival.

“It addresses a lot of issues 

in a way that makes you think 
that you’re not being judged 
or castigated for something,” 
Karmath said. “We were just 
doing this ball toss activity that 
was about consent, so I think 
that’s a good way to teach people 
about consent that’s fun and 
natural.”

LSA 
freshman 
Alexandra 

Chapdelaine 
said 
she 
was 

excited to find that the event was 
forthright with its discussion of 
sexuality.

“There’s a lot of things that 

people don’t talk about because 
they’re seen as too serious or 
taboo, but this kind of brings it 
out in the open and lets everybody 
celebrate themselves,” she said.

Chapdelaine said consent is an 

important issue on campus that 
still isn’t properly discussed and 
she was glad to find that that topic 
in particular was a critical aspect 
of the carnival and presented in 
an engaging way to students.

“It doesn’t get talked about 

enough on college campuses,” 
she said. “I know there’s a lot of 
rhetoric about asking for consent, 
but it’s still awkward for a lot of 
people. So, I think it’s important 
to know how to do that.”

Kamath echoed Chapdelaine’s 

comments 
on 
consensual 

sex, adding, “A lot of times 
you talk about when a non-
consensual event happens and 
the consequences of that, but we 
don’t talk enough about how to 
prevent it as much.”

Polyamorous 
engagements 

explained at the 

Leauge

By EMILY MIILLERS

Daily Staff Reporter 

About 50 people attended back-

to-back interactive lectures on 
sexual health Wednesday evening 
as part of the annual Sexpertise 
conference on sexual health, 
hosted by the University Health 
Service. The events, titled “See-
ing Other People: Open Relation-
ships, Polyamory, and More” and 
“Kink Outside the Box,” took 
place in the Michigan League.

Public Health graduate stu-

dent Tahiya Alam coordinated 
the Sexpertise conference this 
year. She heads the Sexpertise 
committee, which is a part of Sex-
perteam, a group that promotes 
sexual health through various 
campus events. She said the con-
ference is largely based on student 
recommendations from last year.

“We look at what the students 

are looking for in terms of sexual 
education and what’s available in 
terms of resources in our commu-
nity,” Alam said.

Amy Jacobs, a clinical social 

worker at the University of Michi-
gan Health System, presented 
“Seeing Other People: Open Rela-
tionships, Polyamory and More.” 
She discussed different types of 
consensually 
non-monogamous 

relationships and discussed her 
own experiences with open rela-
tionships.

Jacobs emphasized that con-

sensual non-monogamy is not 
cheating because these relation-
ships are based on communica-
tion and honesty.

“You’re negotiating those kinds 

of things with your partner to 
find out what’s important to you,” 
Jacobs said. “What do you need 
out of our relationship so that I 
make sure that I’m respecting 
that relationship when I’m with 
other people?”

Jacobs provided responses she 

often got when she told people 
she was non-monogamous, such 
as questions about how open rela-
tionships work and why she had 
gotten married. Overall, she said 
the decision to be non-monoga-
mous is dependent on an individ-
ual’s definition of a relationship.

“What is your definition of 

a relationship that works? Is it 
being together for a long time? 
Or is it being happy?” Jacobs said. 
“To me that’s not a great mar-
riage, just staying together.”

Jacobs also said being honest 

about her relationships is a posi-
tive for her daughter, in that she 
gets to experience alternative 
family styles and know she has 
options for future relationships.

Public Health graduate student 

Emma Sell-Goodhand and local 
sex educator Tori Renaud pre-
sented “Kink Outside the Box.”

“Kink,” according to present-

ers, is defined as non-normative 
sexual activity, like bondage or 
role-play.

Sell-Goodhand and Renaud 

incorporated various cell phone 
polls for the audience with ques-
tions about kink, misconceptions 
concerning kink, different roles 
and implements in sex play and 
areas to avoid in a more hands-on 
style presentation.

They 
cited 
studies 
that 

expressed the physiological and 
psychological benefits of kink, 
including having a more open per-
spective on sex and other aspects 
of life. Renaud said she believed 
communication among partners 
may lead to benefits from kink.

“These activities require a lot 

of communication,” she said. “A 
lot of psychological problems 
stem from suppressing things — 
whether those be your emotions, 
your desires. 

men is whether they think this 
person who is proposing them is 
going to be a good lover,” Conley 
said. “It’s not about whether or 
not they think they’re going to 
bond with them, marry them and 
support them and their children. 
No. It’s about whether they think 
the sex is going to be good.”

She acknowledged that the 

logic behind this myth seems 
intuitive, but oftentimes the 
truth is shocking to the public.

“It doesn’t fit our images of 

women,” she said.

Conley said one of the strong 

predictors of participation in 
casual sex for both genders is 
whether they feel they will be 
stigmatized. She said women, 
like men, want respect during 
sexual encounters. However, as 
a demographic females are less 
likely to feel respected and more 
likely to be stigmatized.

“The very men who are 

especially interested in having 
casual sex are the ones who 
are especially likely to engage 
in slut-shaming and especially 
endorse the double standard,” 
Conley said.

Conley stressed that these 

social 
factors, 
rather 
than 

biological 
and 
evolutionary, 

largely 
dictate 
women 
and 

men’s motivations to engage in 
and enjoy casual sex.

“When 
you 
control 
for 

these two factors statistically, 
the 
factor 
associated 
with 

stigma and then also the factor 
associated 
with 
how 
much 

pleasure people expect to get 
out of the encounter, generally 
these 
gender 
differences 

evaporate,” she said.

In addition to disproving 

misconceptions 
surrounding 

gender 
differences, 
Conley 

also 
explored 
the 
struggle 

between 
monogamous 
and 

consensual 
non-monogamous 

relationships. She described the 
perception that “monogamy is 
best” as a so-called halo effect 
— society has a tendency to 
ascribe positive traits toward 
monogamist relationships and 
is less likely to do so for “open” 
relationships.

In 
her 
research, 
Conley 

found 
that 
between 

people who cheat on their 
partners 
in 
a 
monogamous 

relationship 
versus 
people 

who are consensually in non-
monogamous relationships, the 
latter group was more likely to 
promote safe health practices. 
For example, the consensually 

non-monogamous participants 
were more likely to talk about 
their 
sexual 
history 
with 

partners and use condoms, and 
they were less likely to engage 
in sexual activity while under 
the influence.

She also challenged the notion 

that 
those 
in 
monogamous 

relationships 
have 
better 

relationships. A series of graphs 
presented during her remarks 
illustrated data showing that 
there was no difference between 
the two groups when asked 
about the level of relationship 
satisfaction, commitment and 
passionate love. The last two 
slides of the series deviated by 
a small margin, showing that 
consensual 
non-monogamous 

partners shared a higher level 
of trust while a greater portion 
of 
monogamous 
partners 

reported a higher level of sexual 
satisfaction.

“If you’re asking me, when 

I look at these data, if I see 
evidence that this whole halo 
effect around monogamy is 
deserved, I really can’t see it,” 
Conley said.

The last myth Conley aimed 

to disprove was that sex is 
immoral and dangerous, and 
she emphasized that people are 
often irrational about avoiding 
sex to avoid STIs. The promoted 
ideal encourages individuals to 
not engage in sexual activity at 
all, she said.

In one of her studies, Conley 

asked participants to rate how 
many people out of 1,000 can 
be expected to die from driving 
from Detroit to Chicago or 
from having one instance of 
unprotected sex — participants 
guessed that people are 17 
times more likely to die from 
unprotected sex. In reality, 
individuals are 20 times more 

likely to die from driving from 
Detroit to Chicago than from 
having unprotected sex, she 
said.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Jacqueline Thomas said she has 
taken a class on the sociology of 
sexuality, and was interested in 
attending the event because of 
her previous experience with 
the topic.

“I thought it would be really 

interesting to see how the 
University 
promotes 
events 

like this,” Thomas said. “I 
really enjoyed the part about 
consensual 
non-monogamy, 

I really enjoyed how the data 
showed virtually no differences; it 
was really nice and informative.”

Creating 
Complex 

Characters:

Dr. Candace Moore, assistant 

professor in the Department of 
Screen Arts and Culture and the 
Women’s Studies Department, 
began her session with a clip from 
the Netflix TV show “Sense8.” 
Her lecture examined LGBTQ 
sexuality in media with a heavy 
focus on scenes from the 1970s.

Moore began by pointing to 

film and television from the ’90s, 
noting the few episodes on shows 
such as ‘Roseanne’ and “L.A. 
Law” that portrayed gay and 
lesbian characters to increase 
ratings. However, she said during 
that time most of what audiences 
saw were a few episodes where 
there would be non-sexualized 
same-sex characters or a couple 
of lesbian kisses.

“I want to question this idea 

that gay sexuality was expressed 
in any kind of out way or 
potentially queer way,” Moore 
said.

I

nterrupting our scene, my act-
ing teacher put her hand on my 
shoulder and looked me in the 

eyes. Soft, yet 
affirmatively, 
she told me to 
“park politeness 
at the door.” 

“Get out of 

your 
head,” 

she 
demanded. 

“Don’t 
think 

about your reac-
tion and don’t 
manipulate your 
response; 
just 

express the feel-
ing that comes naturally to you.” 
Feeling very uncomfortable and 
utterly lost, I stood on the stage 
rubbing the inside of my palms. It 
was hopeless; I didn’t know what to 
say, or the right way to say it.

Our class was learning the Meis-

ner approach to acting, where the 
name of the game is to express 
authentic emotion during an impro-
visation by recalling your own feel-
ings and experiences. Through a 
series of repetition exercises, we 
were supposed to learn how to react 
honestly to our partners’ expressed 
emotion rather than focusing on 
the lines that we were exchang-
ing. For example, if my partner said 
something that made me anxious, 
I would say aloud to him, “You’re 
making me uncomfortable.”

As I stood helpless in front of the 

class, I was saved by yet another 
interjection by my teacher. “Tell-
ing someone what you’re actually 
feeling is hard, isn’t it?” The entire 
class nodded in agreement. “In our 
culture, we’re so focused on being 
polite that we’re afraid to express 
our feelings. We create so many 
miscommunications by being afraid 
to be emotionally connected with 
another person.”

After she said this, I started to 

reflect on my relationships. Even 
though I had only known my act-
ing partners in the class for a few 
weeks, I already felt more connect-
ed to them than to friends that I had 
known for months.

Initially, I was worried about 

how much I would actually enjoy 
this class. Being a person diagnosed 
with generalized anxiety disor-
der, I have difficulty with public 
speaking. I could barely give class 

presentations, let alone channel my 
innermost feelings to share openly 
with a class of 16 strangers. But to 
my surprise, by the end of my scene, 
the unexpected happened.

Instead of provoking stress, the 

activity lessened my stress tre-
mendously. As weird as it sounds, 
it actually felt great to show com-
plete vulnerability to a stranger. I 
hadn’t noticed it before, but after 
that scene, I realized that I had 
been suppressing my emotions in 
order to accommodate others, and 
that my suppression of emotion 
had been worsening my symptoms 
of anxiety. Sincerely exposing my 
feelings to my peers unexpect-
edly eased the restlessness and 
worry that normally overtook me 
in social interactions.

Western culture has taught us 

that it’s abnormal to express emo-
tion. We live in a society where men 
have been conditioned to believe 
that suppressing their emotions 
makes them more masculine, and 
where the expression of emotional 
pain by women has been discour-
aged. It’s unfair that our culture 
has diminished this sense of our 
humanity. Even though a lot of 
people experience a pressure to 
conceal their emotions, people with 
generalized anxiety disorder and 
other emotional disorders, such as 
clinical depression or other mood 
disorders, can be more devastating-
ly affected by the pressure to create 
a façade.

People with generalized anxiety 

disorder are more likely to suppress 
their emotions because they are 
more worried that their emotions 
are unacceptable or inappropriate. 
There have been times when I’ve 
been so worried to show my emo-
tions that my concern has caused 
me physical pain in the form of 
chest discomfort and loss of breath. 
In general, this burden is attributed 
to the development of diseases and 
physical ailments in people with 
high levels of anxiety. Improper 
emotional regulation through lack 
of expression also makes it harder 
for individuals to communicate 
effectively. This leads to miscom-
munications and can result in the 
inability to recognize the emotions 
of others.

Interestingly enough, none of 

my health care providers warned 

me about these behaviors and 
their negative consequences to 
my health. I have been in and out 
of different health systems and I 
have met with multiple doctors 
from diverse areas of expertise, but 
none of them suggested regulating 
emotional expression to help alle-
viate my anxiety. Instead, they all 
strongly recommended different 
types of medications. I finally gave 
in, and I tried one medication after 
another. When the medications 
were not effective, my health care 
professionals urged me to increase 
the dosage. Needless to say, that 
didn’t work, so instead they encour-
aged me to try creatively concocted 
cocktails of antidepressants. Unfor-
tunately, none of these methods 
proved to be helpful.

After experiencing overwhelm-

ing anxiety relief from emotional 
verbalization, I realized I had 
found my alternative to anti-anxi-
ety drugs. I wish I had known that 
communicating 
effectively 
and 

taking the time to connect with 
others would boost my serotonin 
levels as much as the little white 
pill that I took every day. I’m not 
saying there is a better alternative 
to medication for everyone, but I 
think that having open and hon-
est dialogue regularly is beneficial 
for the improvement of emotional 
well-being.

The real kicker is that, in our 

society, it’s becoming more abnor-
mal for a person to show they feel 
something than it is for them to 
feel nothing at all or to mask their 
feelings. It’s considered an insult 
to be described as an emotional 
individual. As a nation, we need to 
start doing a better job at acknowl-
edging our humanity by dimin-
ishing our capitalist culture and 
disregarding the idea that we don’t 
have time for feelings because 
we’re so busy with work. In addi-
tion to this, we need to address the 
emotional detachment that often 
comes in the form of competitive 
nature. We need to reverse the dis-
cernable loss of empathy for the 
betterment of mental and physical 
health of people with and without 
generalized anxiety disorder or 
other emotional disorders.

O

ne sleepy morning during my sopho-
more year of high school, my teacher 
posed a question to the class that has 

lingered in the back of my 
mind ever since: “Which 
are more valuable to soci-
ety: the sciences or the 
arts?”

I remember most of the 

kids in my class answered 
science without hesita-
tion. I had much more 
trouble 
producing 
an 

answer, but I settled on 
arts partially to be devil’s 
advocate 
and 
partially 

because I couldn’t imag-
ine a world without art or music or books.

Last week, I attended Dick Costolo’s talk 

about leadership and liberal arts, which 
reminded me of this age-old argument. Cos-
tolo, former CEO of Twitter and a University 
of Michigan LSA computer science alum, pin-
pointed exactly how I feel about the role of 
humanities in education.

As a student who has a deep interest in both 

biology and English, I’ve found that I straddle 
a gray area few students choose to traverse. 
Even though I’m passionate about both the 
sciences and the arts, I’ve had trouble articu-
lating to my peers exactly why I value taking 
humanities courses (except for the fact that 
writing well is an important skill, or that I 
personally like how the two disciplines exer-
cise different parts of my brain, and that I’d be 
bored if I only took science and math classes).

Many of my STEM-focused peers lament 

the humanities distribution requirements 
they have to fulfill for graduation. These 
courses seem to eat up valuable credits that 
could be used to take another science or math 
course, one that teaches skills more pertinent 
to their major or desired career. But when 
students studying the humanities lament the 
science distribution requirement, they’re met 
with incredulity that they would spurn such 
“essential” topics in education.

While Costolo implored students to take 

computer science courses due to their appli-
cability in the global economy, he also noted 
that nearly every discipline — sciences and 
humanities alike — teaches students critical 
thinking skills. He argued that what sets the 
critical thinking in humanities subjects apart 
from that in STEM subjects is that they teach 
us what to think about.

That is, the critical thinking in the human-

ities requires the consideration of multiple 
perspectives and factors that contextualize a 
problem before attempting to solve it.

In the science and math classes I’ve taken 

throughout my schooling, I’ve found little room 
for varying perspectives or methods in course-
work. Sure, there may be several approaches 
to a given problem, but thought processes are 
often restricted by the single correct answer 
that lies at the end of each question. Much of 
the context of science is stripped in practice — 
we’re usually forced to work within a set of con-
trols or a finite set of mathematical theorems.

Of course, science has room for concep-

tual and abstract discussions, but it still lacks 
the interpersonal aspect integral to thought 

in the humanities. And these interpersonal 
skills often are more important in a career 
than technical skills.

The humanities courses I’ve taken encour-

age the accumulation of disparate viewpoints 
in conversation to strengthen a student’s inter-
personal skills. More often than not, it’s per-
fectly OK if a student takes away something 
different from a text than the next student, so 
long as they derive their reasoning from a rel-
evant source. The humanities force students 
to sift through countless details to find what’s 
important, to become adept listeners, to con-
sider experiences outside their own.

We need the humanities to serve as a liaison 

between the world of science and the world 
of human interaction, to check the power of 
science and to force the scientific world to 
consider the ethical and interpersonal rami-
fications of scientific advancements. Know-
ing how to draw a curved-arrow mechanism 
for a bimolecular substitution reaction can-
not teach a doctor to empathize with patients 
of different backgrounds than their own. 
Knowing how to take the line integral of a 
function cannot help engineers develop tech-
nologies that consider a community’s needs.

If we study science for science’s sake alone, 

we run the risk of endangering humanity 
itself. Life-prolonging medications, artificial 
intelligence and genetic engineering are all 
significant marks of human achievement, but 
if used with the wrong intentions, they most 
certainly have the potential to destroy soci-
eties and render life intolerable. The good 
science can do for us resides in our consider-
ation of how these developments will shape 
human life and interpersonal interactions in 
the long term — and this is simply not some-
thing taught in most STEM courses.

Yet students don’t flock to STEM courses 

purely out of interest, but rather pragmatic 
concerns. College, after all, is a financial 
investment, and it certainly is reasonable to 
want a return on that investment. There is no 
dearth of jobs in STEM fields, and often these 
fields lead to lucrative careers — ones that 
can pay off college debt and allow students to 
earn comfortable livings post-graduation.

But for students to boil down which class-

es they take to the market value of the skills 
taught, they forgo classes that can teach 
them empathy or ethics or effective commu-
nication — skills that possess value that has 
no price. Costolo — who made Twitter the 
booming social media company it is today — 
emphasized that his company would not have 
been as successful as it is without the skills he 
learned from the humanities courses he stud-
ied here at the University. 

Society will perpetually juggle the influenc-

es of the sciences and the arts in our everyday 
lives. Students can — and should — choose the 
field that makes them burn with passion, but 
they cannot dismiss the interconnectedness 
of the sciences and the arts and the value that 
each can contribute to their education, their 
career and their character.

Life, after all, is so much more than a dis-

crete set of scientific and mathematical truths.

the typical definition of “tall, dark 
and handsome.” He’s short if you’re 
not into guys under six foot and a 
little pale, but I truly find him ador-
able. His, for lack of a better term, 
“doughy” body doesn’t put me off. 
If anything, I find him more attrac-
tive for it. He seems less unobtain-
able. He seems more real.

The reaction I get quite obvi-

ously means I’m supposed to fall 
over myself for celebrities like the 
Hemsworth brothers or Channing 
Tatum. If I said I didn’t find them 
attractive I’d be lying. Their chis-
eled bodies and sharp jawlines are 
nice to look at and all, but they’re 
entirely too intimidating. I’d never 
be able to talk to any of them in real 
life. But I think we’ve established I 
can’t talk to men in general so that’s 
not saying much.

The thing about crushes that 

people tend to forget is that they 
are supposed to be based on more 
than looks. There’s a difference 
between finding someone attrac-
tive and having a crush on them. I 
find many men attractive. I sure as 
hell wouldn’t date all of them. Sure, 
pretty men may be dreamy in their 
own right but that doesn’t mean 
other men aren’t.

We’re constantly barraged with 

discussion 
surrounding 
unreal-

istic beauty ideals women face 
every day. The same goes for men 
as well. We don’t think it’s fair of 
men to compare us to Victoria’s 
Secret models so why would we 
compare them to Calvin Klein mod-
els? What kind of message are we 
sending when we fawn over the 
airbrushed men while completely 
disregarding others we deem not 
fitting as an ideal male? I’m not try-
ing to downplay women’s struggles 
with body image, as there are sig-
nificantly more women who suffer 
from body image issues; however, it 
should be recognized that while we 
grapple with how thin our bodies 
are, 18 percent of adolescent males 
struggle with wanting to be bigger 
or more muscular. 

Those kinds of men are few and 

far between anyway — with only 1 
to 2 percent of men having the ide-
alized body type, it’s as unrealistic 
to expect abs on a guy as it is to 
expect a woman to have a 20-inch 
waist. Most of us are going to end 
up marrying the Seth Rogens of the 
world. It shouldn’t be a bad thing to 
be attracted to “normal” men. I’m 
not saying every other man isn’t 
normal. It’s just that Hollywood is 
full of unusually beautiful people; 
that’s why they make a ridiculous 
amount of money by having their 
picture taken or starring in films. 

It shouldn’t be everyone’s auto-

matic reaction to scoff at my choice 
of celebrity crush. But it is. “Why 
Seth Rogen when there are so many 
more hot men to choose from?” 
people have asked.

You see, I’m crushing hard 

because not only is he hilari-
ous, but also Seth cares deeply 
about social issues. He addressed 
Congress two years ago in an 
attempt to raise awareness about 
the lack of Alzheimer’s funding. 

His mother-in-law has suffered 
from Alzheimer’s for almost 11 
years and he has made big bounds 
to help. Seth and his wife began 
Hilarity for Charity, a foundation 
to make Alzheimer’s advocates 
out of millennials. They hold the 
Los Angeles Variety Show to raise 
money and awareness for the dis-
ease. It is the sweetest thing. He’s 
a man of substance with aspira-
tions and a solid dedication to his 
wife and their relationship.

As young girls we’re primed to 

want to find our “Prince Charm-
ing” and he’s usually portrayed as 
the old Ken-doll-like man who has 
a perfectly symmetrical face and 
not an inch of fat anywhere on his 
body. Now there is a “curvy Ken” 
to match his new “curvy Barbie,” 
so we’re making moves toward 
body peace.

Still, the “men of our dreams” 

have no substance. They don’t run 
charity events nor do they have 
ambition. We’re brainwashed into 
thinking these empty shells of 
humans are worthy of our time.

For men, it’s more or less the 

same except they often get their 
ideas of ideal women from porn and 
half-naked models on the pages of 
magazines. Long cellulite-free legs, 
flowing lustrous hair and blemish-
free faces bombard their psyches on 
a daily basis, leading to disappoint-
ment for some when it’s usually not 
the case in real life. 

We should all aspire to be more 

cognizant of who we admire. It’s 
definitely OK to look at a celebrity 
and appreciate their beauty, but 
putting them on a pedestal is far 
from necessary. How about we all 
just agree that we don’t have to be 
exceptionally beautiful to be of any 
worth to one another?

Petrus and Qiu bring 
the East to the West 

By MERIN MCDIVITT

For the Daily

Juliet Petrus is comfortable 

and at home in her cozy Chi-
cago apartment. Yet the posters 
on her wall, 
1960s socialist 
art accompa-
nied by bright 
red 
Chinese 

characters, 
hint 
at 
the 

exotic 
expe-

riences 
that 

have 
shaped 

her career.

Opera sing-

er Petrus and 
her accompa-
nying pianist Lydia Qiu will be 
performing at Britton Recital 
Hall on Friday, Feb. 12, and at 
the Detroit Opera House for a 
Valentine’s Day Concert on Sun-
day, Feb. 14. The performance, 
entitled “A Great Distance,” will 
feature Chinese art song off 
their recent album of the same 
name.

The genre, unknown to most 

Western listeners, even those 
knowledgeable 
about 
opera, 

blends European classical opera 
with Chinese lyrics, which are 
taken from ancient Chinese 
poems and set to music. The 
style was originally created by 
Chinese composers educated in 
Europe during the early 20th 
Century who wanted to breathe 
new life into old forms. But dur-
ing and after the Communist 
Revolution, foreign forms of 
expression were frowned upon, 
if not banned. This period of 
musical history remains fas-
cinating for Petrus, as those 
brightly-hued posters suggest.

As China has opened up to the 

West in recent decades, a hun-
ger for European and American 
artistic traditions has taken the 
country by storm.

“There’s so much emphasis 

these days in China on being 
‘Western’ as in dressing or 
looking Western, listening to 
Western music and watching 
Western TV,” Petrus said in an 
interview with the Michigan 
Daily.

This 
desire 
for 
Western 

expression led to the collabora-
tive forces that drew both Qiu 
and Petrus to China and then 
eventually together.

After training at the Uni-

versity of Michigan School of 
Music, Theatre and Dance, both 
Petrus and Qiu found their way 
into the Chinese music scene. 
For Qiu, it was relatively simple: 
as a Chinese national, her inter-
est in both Eastern and Western 
classical music pulled her in 
both directions, working with 
Chinese students at times and 
spending the majority of her 
time as a faculty member at the 
University.

For Petrus, the route had 

a few more twists and turns. 
After performing as a Western 
opera singer throughout the 
United States, she enrolled in 
a brand new program called “I 
Sing Beijing,” which sent clas-
sically trained American sing-
ers to China for free intensive 
language, cultural and music 
training. She fell in love with 
the country that welcomed her 
with open arms.

“Initially, it was the audi-

ences in China that hooked me. 
There’s a great appreciation for 
Westerns who take the time to 
sing or speak Chinese,” Petrus 
said. “But these days, it’s truly 
about giving back a part of the 
musical culture.”

As Petrus’s Chinese perfor-

mances became more and more 
popular, she wanted to raise 
awareness of overlooked forms 
of expression in the country’s 
vast musical repertoire. Chinese 
art song, a form often relegated 
to music conservatories, seemed 

like just the thing.

“There is so much Chinese art 

song that is beautiful and under-
performed or unnoticed,” she 
said. “In a way, it seems like a 
Westerner shining light on this 
helps to bring validity to these 
songs.”

As a beloved Western per-

former, she was able to bring 
attention to the form more than 
even a Chinese national alone 
could.

Petrus and Qiu knew each 

other slightly from their time at 
the University, and now seemed 
like the perfect time to com-
bine their talents. The result-
ing album, “A Great Distance,” 
bridges great musical traditions 
from two continents. It has been 
well received in China, where 
many opera teachers now use it 
as a way to show their students 
the true artistry that the genre 
is capable of.

“Being that we come from 

very different backgrounds,” 
Petrus said, “I believe that we 
both bring a very different point 
of view to the music and push 
each other to look at songs with 
fresh eyes.”

After their United States tour 

is complete, the two women will 
return to China for another visit. 
They perform at conservatories 
and concert halls throughout 
the country, and hold work-
shops and master classes for the 
many aspiring singers thirsty 
for new musical styles.

Helping 
young 
students 

reach their dreams is a rich and 
rewarding process for both per-
formers.

“As much as I love to per-

form, I also love working with 
young Chinese singers,” Petrus 
explained. “I have been so 
impressed with the levels of 
singers at many of the conser-
vatories we’ve visited. I always 
look forward to going back and 
working with more students.”

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Album of the Year: 
Give it to Kendrick

By WILL GREENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Kendrick Lamar does not need 

an Album of the Year Grammy win 
— let’s start with that. The Gram-
mys, however, need to give him the 
award.

For Lamar, who has a near 

record-tying 11 nominations for 
his earth-shattering To Pimp A 
Butterfly, this one award means 
nothing to his legacy as an artist. 
His work will, and already does, 
speak for itself when it comes time 
to evaluate his career.

Not to mention, plenty of crit-

ics disregard the Grammys for 
rewarding only pop stars, rarely 
recognizing music with complex-
ity or boundary-pushing imagina-
tion. But that could change if they 
give To Pimp A Butterfly the win 
for Album of the Year. It would 
mean Grammy voters reward 
pure artistry — which is the way it 
should be.

Lamar has already suffered 

a high-profile Grammy snub. In 
2014, his wildly popular, but still 
thoughtfully crafted, good kid, 
m.A.A.d city lost Best Rap Album 
to Macklemore’s debut LP. Most 
of the hip-hop world, including 
Macklemore himself, thought 
Kendrick deserved the win: the 
voters made a mistake. If they’re 
smart, they won’t do it again — 
especially when there is so much 
to gain.

To Pimp A Butterfly (TPAB) 

is the album to beat for the rap 
world. There has never been any-
thing like it and rappers will be 
hard pressed to compete with it 
moving forward. Lamar’s mas-
terpiece achieved the crown for 
two reasons that the Grammys 
should note: it perfectly fits the 
platform of an “album,” and it 
was a huge risk.

A brief point needs to be made 

that TPAB is not exceptional 
because of its racial timeliness or 
commentary. Yes, Lamar makes 
exquisite observations about race 
in 
America 
(“Institutionalized 

manipulation and lies / Recip-

rocation of freedom only live in 
your eyes” on “The Blacker the 
Berry”), but far too many critics 
praise TPAB for its political timeli-
ness amid the discussion of police 
discrimination, 
basically 
giv-

ing him credit for addressing the 
topic at all. Let’s not kid ourselves: 
there have been plenty of rappers 
that took on the topic long before 
Lamar was even recording (see 
Rakim, Nas, or Tupac, to name 
a few) and while racial inequal-
ity might be back in the spotlight 
it’s by no means a new issue (see 
American history).

Being Black comprises a signifi-

cant part of who Kendrick Lamar 
is, so of course the topic will per-
vade every corner of his writing 
— and it does. But simply taking on 
the topic isn’t what makes Lamar 
or TPAB stand out. What’s more 
significant is Lamar himself — his 
identity.

To Pimp A Butterfly is like a 

tour through the highs and lows 
of Black American life, and Lamar 
is the tour guide. The music pro-
vides the scene — sometimes 
resilient, jazzy and celebratory 
like in “Alright;” sometimes bit-
ing, ominous, and overwhelming 
like in “Wesley’s Theory” or “How 
Much a Dollar Cost.” All the while, 
Lamar’s rapping explores the dis-
cord with his first-hand, anecdotal 
account of a conscientious Ameri-
can’s life.

What makes TPAB a complete 

album is that it takes all 16 tracks 
for Lamar to walk us through 
it all. You can’t sum up Lamar’s 
feelings on life as a young, Black 
man in the US with just one song. 
He explores the complexity of his 
newfound fame, sometimes own-
ing his accomplishments like in 
“King Kunta,” but also his regrets 
and untreatable guilt in songs like 
‘u.’ The album is a character study, 
becoming more universal as it 
becomes more personal. Lamar 
mostly discusses his life as a suc-
cessful recording artist, which is 
not something most of his audi-
ence will directly relate to. But 
nearly everyone can connect with 

the insecurity or regret that comes 
with pursuing a goal, or reaching a 
new point in life. Lamar achieves 
relatability by actually sharing 
more specifics about his emotional 
path.

Now, what makes TPAB quint-

essential art is that it is not just 
about Lamar’s emotions, but it is 
his emotions. It’s the difference 
between third person and first 
person. Taylor Swift, a hot con-
tender for the Album of the Year, 
can talk about life and its com-
plexity, and many argue she has 
plenty to say, but with To Pimp 
A Butterfly, we are experiencing 
Kendrick Lamar in real time. The 
way he blends music with his con-
fessional, poignant rap feels genu-
ine and intimate — the work itself 
is his identity. Kendrick Lamar 
exemplifies what an artist should 
be: a human who experiences life 
through his craft.

Acknowledging 
this 
alone 

would be a step in the right direc-
tion for the Grammys voters, but 
it’s not the only important point: 
Lamar also took a huge risk with 
To Pimp A Butterfly.

Coming off the wildly success-

ful, wildly popular, club-worthy 
m.A.A.d city, TPAB is an enormous 
leap. There’s not a large market for 
an album of jazz-laden funk, with 
an unpredictable musical gumbo 
of other genres and styles — or 
at least not before TPAB. This is 
the album Lamar always wanted 
to make and it’s an uninhibited 
expression of his artistry. The 
Grammys not only should reward 
artists that attempt to push the 
boundaries of their genre in this 
way, but it must reward them 
when they do so and succeed.

Again, this should mean very 

little to Lamar. He could go 10 
for 11 or 0 for 11 and he’d still be 
widely regarded as the best in the 
game, but giving To Pimp A But-
terfly the night’s most prestigious 
honor would be a sign from the 
higher-ups in the music world that 
they respect and encourage great 
music from real artists. The night 
is theirs to blow.

FILM REVIEW
‘Pride and Prejudice 
and Zombies’ is a lot

By LAUREN WOOD

Daily Arts Writer

The inside of this movie the-

ater smells like socks and stale 
popcorn, except I don’t know 
that 
because 

I’m not here. 
Instead, 
I’m 

fully 
present 

in a zombified 
Regency-era 
England, and 
I’m 
getting 

scared of what 
might be mov-
ing around me 
in the dark. 
On the misty, 
grey 
moors 

outside of London proper, zom-
bies are known to spring out of 
the woods at any passing car-
riage, hungry for the human 
brains that will complete their 
transformation into the undead. 
Like many girls their age, the 
Bennet sisters have completed 
their combat training in China, 
but now are entering into an 
equally difficult battle — try-
ing to find suitable husbands 
amongst those still living.

“Pride and Prejudice and 

Zombies,” based on the parody 
novel by Seth Grahame-Smith, 
rewrites Jane Austen’s origi-
nal novel with an underlying 
narrative of war between Eng-
lish society and the zombies 
that have arisen following the 
Black Plague. The film does not 
let this literary basis fall to the 
side, opening with the iconi-
cally mutated line, “It is a truth 
universally acknowledged that 
a zombie in possession of brains 
must be in want of more brains.”

Gimmicky and gaudy, yes, 

but completely engrossing and 
fun nonetheless. The rest of the 
film upholds this strange cross-

over, taking itself just seriously 
enough to pull its audience in 
but not so seriously that it fails 
to indulge in the utterly ridicu-
lous. The sets and costuming are 
elaborate, drawing out the gran-
deur of Bingely’s famed estate 
with candlelit dances and gilded 
parlor rooms and the Bennet 
sisters’ beauty in multihued silk 
gowns complete with match-
ing dagger sheaths and flint-
lock muskets. These displays of 
splendor are complemented with 
equally gory scenes of zombie 
violence. In one scene the sisters 
fight in slow-motion through a 
ball overrun with the undead, 
cutting down decaying legs, slit-
ting black-blooded throats and 
stomping in the skulls of every-
thing that crosses them.

This dramatized focus on vio-

lence and extravagance trickles 
into the romantic plotline of the 
film as well, where Elizabeth 
(Lily James, “Downton Abbey”) 
and Darcy (Sam Riley, “Malefi-
cent”) are caught verbally spar-
ring so precisely in the original 
Austen book; here their words 
are accented by expert physical 
sparring as well. Their hatred 
for one another is undercut only 
by their respect for the others’ 
skills as a warrior, and their 
unfolding love story holds true 
to the original theme of the book. 
Where the film indulges visually 
and physically, it does the same 
romantically, 
and 
although 

their love story is cheesily over-
dramatized at points, with both 
characters drawn to the point 
of ridiculousness, anything less 
would be overshadowed by the 
rest of the film.

The weird mash-up of the 

film’s 
premise 
works 
when 

considering the tone of repres-
sion and denial already pres-
ent in Regency England. While 

it may seem strange that the 
society is still focusing on balls 
and engagements in the face of 
complete annihilation, it would 
also be strange to accept any-
thing less from the strict social 
parameters of the time, where 
any discomfort is ignored for the 
sake of civility. The only time 
this careful balance between 
civil and gory seems to fall to 
the wayside is in the character-
ization of Lady Catherine (Lena 
Headey, “Game of Thrones”), 
whose strangeness the film 
could do without. In the book, 
Darcy’s aunt is an imposingly 
proper figure in society, and 
here is rewritten as masculine 
zombie-hunter 
extraordinaire 

who diverges from the careful 
construction of the other char-
acters.

Watching “PPZ” in the the-

ater, there is an equal mixture 
of screaming and laughing. For 
much of the film, I had a hard 
time closing my gaping mouth 
or looking away as brains flew 
across the screen or the leads 
kissed amid a burning town. 
After studying film for what 
will in April have been a full 
four years, I’ve come to accept 
that movies can be deemed 
“good” for any number of rea-
sons, a huge one being simply 
that they’re fun to watch. “Pride 
and Prejudice and Zombies” is 
exactly this, and in a way holds 
everything a strange, indulgent 
and massively dramatized hor-
ror film should. With a hoard of 
brain eating zombies, impres-
sively choreographed combat 
scenes, a pink wedding finale 
and a theater full of giggling 
girls cheering on the heroine to 
smash in the skull of the crea-
tures around her, the fun of 
the movie dissolves most of the 
faults to be found.

A

n introverted thespian. 
It seems strange doesn’t 
it? Most thespians (you 

would think) are loud and out-
going people. At least that’s 
what I’ve 
assumed the 
stereotype 
to be.

But after 

observing 
the dynamic 
between 
what people 
bring to the 
stage and 
how they 
behave off of 
it, I realize 
the phenomenon of the intro-
verted thespian is growing — 
and it’s an interesting one.

The first step towards under-

standing this is to dismantle 
the established stereotype. I 
don’t think that just because 
an actor feels comfortable tak-
ing on a role and performing in 
front of hundreds of people, that 
he or she behaves that way all 
the time. The same holds for a 
person who is extroverted at all 
times and would never dream of 
performing in front of people. 
One factor doesn’t make the 
other true — abandon this ste-
reotype.

In high school, the hours I 

spent in drama club gave me a 
lot of time to analyze the thes-
pian stereotype. They were loud, 
extroverted people, no doubt. 
I was among them. But more 
times than not, the people who 
stood out onstage were the ones 
who I didn’t see as extroverted. 
Onstage, their introverted 
qualities disappeared. They were 
entirely different.

The second point of under-

standing is this: taking on a new 
role literally means adopting 
traits and qualities that an actor 
doesn’t actually possess. When I 
watch an actor play a character, 
I often think they act the same 
way off the stage. That’s probably 
a sign of a good actor, not neces-
sarily an indication of their real 
personality.

We can all look at Kristen 

Chenoweth and say yeah, she fits 
the part of Glinda in “Wicked” 
perfectly. She’s outgoing, ener-
getic and lively, everything 
you need for the role. When I 
watch her in interviews or play-
ing other roles, her demeanor 
screams Glinda.

Someone else may play that 

part onstage with an equal 
amounts of energy and charisma, 
just as the role calls for. But I 
would not be surprised if that 
actress is nothing at all like the 
gregarious and charismatic Che-
noweth. 

But the calm and reserved 

actress preparing for her time 
onstage might just have some-
thing to offer.

My older sister Gabriel, for 

example, is an actress. Two 
words I would use to describe 
her? Calm and gentle. She is 
levelheaded and in a group, 
she’s rarely the one to demand 
the attention or provide the 
excessive noise. She leaves that 
task to those in her company. 
Most of the time, people would 
assume the thespians are the 
people around her who can’t 
shut up. She proves them wrong, 
of course.

Onstage, Gabriel shines. 

She plays such a vast range of 
characters, stretching from a 

young, innocent child to a grown, 
mature adult. You would never 
guess she’s the quiet one. That 
she’s the thespian. And an intro-
verted one at that.

That’s the point of acting. 

Becoming a character entirely 
apart from who one really is. 
That isn’t to say that resembling 
the character the actor plays is 
a bad thing, oftentimes that’s a 
pleasure to watch.

But to fall into the assump-

tion that a successful thespian, 
or a believable one, has to be 
extroverted — is false. A wise 
actor aims for the audience to 
simply believe the character 
that he or she takes on. It takes 
an incredible amount of time 
to study the physical and emo-
tional traits of a character and 
portray them as natural.

I think the best response an 

actor could ever get from their 
work is: “Wow, that was you up 
there? I’ve never seen you behave 
anything like that before.”

Yes. Exactly. That’s a job well 

done for the thespian embody-
ing a character whose traits are 
drastically different than what 
the actor views as inherent quali-
ties.

The actors who study their 

roles and think, “Nope, I don’t 
behave anything like this in 
real life,” are often the ones 
who make you believe their 
character the most. They have 
spent long hours reversing their 
natural tendencies to become 
an incredibly different per-
son onstage — and the result 
deserves our praise.

Dance performance 
celebrates Black lives

By GILLIAN JAKAB

Daily Arts Writer

“Healing is just as important as 

protest,” choreographer Camille 
A. Brown wants to remind us. 
Although 
Brown and her 
dancers echo 
the 
serious 

assertion that 
Black 
Lives 

Matter, 
they 

seek to spell 
out why with 
their 
bod-

ies. 
“BLACK 

GIRL: 
Lin-

guistic 
Play” 

will 
unfold 

at the Power 
Center on Sat-
urday, as part 
of the UMS 
winter 
sea-

son. A dance 
piece 
set 
to 

an original score performed live 
and culminating in a moderated 
interactive discussion with the 
audience, the piece is a celebra-
tion of identity — both personal 
and that of a collective cultural 
history.

It harkens back to the unbri-

dled joy and expression (in 
metaphor, if not lived real-
ity) of childhood. The piece’s 
movement vocabularies thread 
through generations of Afri-
can American history, from 
West African drum beats to 
coded resistance in the Ante-
bellum South, club social danc-
ing leading up to the civil rights 
movement and on through the 
decades to Michael Jackson, the 
electric slide and urban rhythms 
of stepping and street games.

Maybe you paused at the title. 

What does it mean?

“‘Linguistic’ — when people 

hear that they automatically 
assume … is there text?” Brown 
said in an interview with The 
Michigan Daily. “That’s not the 
only way people communicate, 
it’s the language of the body.”

The term “play,” too, has a few 

meanings. There’s the obvious 

activity of merriment: playing 
children’s games on the street 
like Double Dutch. A play can be 
a gambit — a strategic or aggres-
sive move in pursuits like chess 
or love. Or there’s play as in a 
theatrical performance. Brown 
draws on all of the definitions 
and challenges us to an expan-
sive understanding of the word.

The title’s first part, “BLACK 

GIRL,” may seem self-evident, 
but after deconstructing the 
title’s description, we’re left to 
question the meaning of those 
words as well. What does it mean 
to be a Black girl? To whom? 
What are the images or stereo-
types we see?

“What about childhood, what 

was my childhood like? I real-
ized: wow you don’t see your 
childhood, you don’t see those 
games, you’re depicted as those 
stereotypes.” Brown said. “I 
wanted to do something differ-
ent than what I saw out there.”

Kyra 
Gaunt’s 
book, 
“The 

Games Black Girls Play” sparked 
the concept of Brown’s piece 
and as it took off from its origi-
nal form, it evolved, draw-
ing life from the dancers’ own 
stories. Like social dance, the 
established structure of the 
choreography gives way to per-
sonal interpretation and style. 
Each individual contribution 
adds a layer of flair, of experi-
ence and of memory. Through 
these shared stories, the danc-
ers articulate a time before their 
identity was a label tacked on to 
their bodies — a time when they 
just simply were, in rhythm and 
in movement.

“‘BLACK 
GIRL: 
Linguis-

tic Play’ is rooted in childhood 
memory, but it’s rooted in all of 
our childhood memories and 
all of our experiences,” Brown 
said. “So it’s not just me telling 
my story, it’s the company tell-
ing their stories. We had a lot of 
conversations. When you go back 
and you think about that period 
of time and when you think about 
identity: what was that point in 
your life when people started 
classifying you? You are short, 
you are dark-skinned. You are. 
You are. How did you feel about 
that? Going back, people really 
(began) unpacking that personal 
history.”

The piece is organized into 

three sections following the 
maturation of a Black girl in 
urban America. Brown herself 
plays both a young girl, around 
14, and later embodies a Black 
woman in motherhood — a chal-
lenging feat for a petite and 
youthful choreographer.

One section is dedicated to the 

movement lexicon of West and 
Sub-Saharan African and its sub-
sequent translations through the 
generations of African-American 
dance vernacular, detailed in 
the rich reference and resource 
guide found in the program. The 
“Pattin Juba” was a term used for 
the body percussion of slaves in 
the 18th century when dancing 
and drumming were forbidden, 
as a way to connect to their heri-

tage. Elements of the juba can be 
seen in social dances, including 
The Dougie, and even in urban 
street games like Double Dutch.

“The aspects of rhythm and 

creative identity are timeless, but 
the way people do it is progres-
sive,” she said. The thing about 
Double Dutch, even though it’s 
a childhood game — when you 
think about it and really dis-
sect it — it’s music. It’s musi-
cal compositions: its phrasing, 
it’s polyrhythms, you know it’s 
an extremely sophisticated art 
form, but because children do 
it, its seen as trivial. Also hand 
clapping games — I don’t know if 
you’ve played numbers, but that’s 
a hard game!”

A renowned choreographer 

and dancer, Brown had to ask 
herself and her dancers to strip 
away some aspects of their for-
mal dance training and get into 
expressions of socially-learned 
movement and style that were 
more personal and entirely their 
own.

“I told my stylist I want us to 

be able to walk off the stage and 
walk into the street and we don’t 
look any different from anyone 
else,” she said. So it was just a 
lot of stripping and it’s like, what 
does it really mean for you to 
be yourself and how would you 
dance your dance being yourself 
and not just being dancer num-
ber eight.”

Brown feels this piece in par-

ticular offers entry points for 
audience members to see their 
stories, whether or not they are 
Black or female, or even “danc-
ers.”

“When I create movement 

I’m not necessarily speaking to 
dance aficionados — I want it to 
be accessible to the people who 
do the electric slide at the party 
… And I think often times, espe-
cially at university, people see 
a dance show and they’re like ‘I 
don’t know that — don’t got noth-
ing to do with me. I won’t go,’ but 
its actually really for them,” she 
said. “And I’m always excited 
when I see students in the the-
atre. Always.”

With 
African-American 

social justice in the vanguard 
on college campuses and around 
the country, “BLACK GIRL: 
Linguistic Play” suggests that 
parallel to the response of activ-
ism, is the equally important 
celebration of cultural iden-
tity. We often focus on clashes 
and on protests highlighted by 
the media, and Brown reminds 
us to acknowledge the healing 
aspects of our communities.

“We definitely need to talk 

about the issues, but we also 
need to talk about the joy … and 
the authenticity, and the move-
ment, and the social dance and 
the relationships because that, 
in a sense, is answering the 
question: well why do black lives 
matter?,” she said. “This is why. 
There’s a history there, there’s 
sisterhood there, there’s a lin-
eage there. Those are the things 
that I wanted to elevate in this 
particular piece.”

Daily Community Culture Editor

He introduced the world to 

its first Analrapist, delivered the 
most infuriating audition of all 
time on his ’90s 
sketch 
show 

“Mr. 
Show” 

and has made 
increasingly 
poor 
deci-

sions under the 
guise of Todd 
Margaret. 
With a filmog-
raphy ranging 
from “Eternal Sunshine of the 
Spotless Mind” to “It’s A Disas-
ter” to “Alvin and the Chip-
munks,” actor and comedian 
David Cross has made his mark 
not only on the world of comedy, 
but also on the world of film, 
television and art.

And now, he wants to make 

America great again.

“I am extremely excited to get 

back out on the road after six long 
years away. I was very busy writ-
ing for The View, but now that the 
kids are off to college, my wife’s 
regiment has been transferred to 
McMurdo Station in the South 
Pole, and I’m near completion 
on Fallout 4, it’s time to start up 
the bus and bring my patented, 
fart-inducing laugh winces to 
a town near you,” Cross wrote 
on his Facebook page upon first 
announcing the “Making Ameri-
ca Great Again!” tour.

Although this is the explana-

tion most fans would prefer to 
believe, Cross’s sudden return to 
stand-up was a much more calcu-
lated decision, he explained in an 
e-mail interview with The Michi-
gan Daily. 

“We knew we weren’t going 

to be able to do more Bob and 
David’s this year because of Bob’s 
schedule, and simultaneously I 
found out that I had to have major 
shoulder surgery which has a 
long and intense recovery period 
where I can’t travel so I figured it 
was the perfect time to get the set 
together and hit the road,” Cross 
wrote.

The Bob referred to is Bob 

Odenkirk, a comedian, writer and 
actor who has accompanied Cross 
in projects over the years from 

HBO’s “Mr. Show” in the ’90s to 
Netflix’s revival series “W/ Bob & 
David” that premiered this past 
November.

After a six year hiatus from 

stand-up, Cross is returning to 
his roots on the stage for a 53-stop 
tour. Gracing Ann Arbor with his 
presence at the Michigan Theater 
this Saturday, Feb. 13, Cross will 
be presenting his signature form 
of alternative comedy.

Known 
for 
never 
writing 

punchlines in favor of freeform 
stand-up, Cross has been tak-
ing his routine city by city, mak-
ing improvements and changes 
as each performance passes. No 
performance is the same, and 
with each stop the comedic rants 
become slightly more finessed 
and calculated in their criticisms.

“I don’t really sit down and 

write my material,” Cross wrote. 
“For the most part it’s developed 
on stage … Experience tells me 
that the last few shows of the tour 
will be significantly different than 
the first few shows of the tour.”

This alternative form of com-

edy that involves the use of 
scribbled notes and improvisa-
tion began to develop in the ’90s. 
Alongside comedians like Louis 
C.K. and Janeane Garofalo, Cross 
participated in typical stand-up 
until venturing off into the free-
form stylings of “Un-Cabaret,” 
an alternative comedy troupe in 
Boston.

Since then, freeform stand-up 

has developed a larger following, 
going as far as to have its own fes-
tival on the West Coast.

“It’s not seen as ‘weird’ or ‘ama-

teur’ now. The fact that there is a 
HUGE Alternative Comedy Fes-
tival in LA (RIOT Festival) that’s 
in its fourth year is crazy to think 
about from the perspective of 
when the whole ‘alternative’ com-
edy scene started,” Cross wrote.

As an established comedian 

and actor, Cross has been a part 
of numerous projects, ranging 
from comedies with cult follow-
ings like “Arrested Development” 
to commercial successes in the 
form of “Kung Fu Panda.” Cross 
has, as a result, seen firsthand 
the reaction diehard fans have to 
fairly removed actors and actress-
es entering the mainstream, he 
regardless defines “selling out” 

differently from what one might 
imagine.

“It’s changed dramatically,” 

he wrote. Back in my day if you 
even wore a ‘Budweiser’ t-shirt on 
stage because they paid for your 
back line you’d be considered a 
sell out. Nowadays you can do a 
commercial for a fucking bank 
and no-one blinks an eye.”

There is a generational stigma 

around artists who enter into 
projects solely for commercial 
rather 
than 
artistic 
reasons, 

and often artists, musicians and 
actors will suffer because of 
this. The second a song or show 
becomes critically acclaimed, or 
an artist participates in a critical-
ly acclaimed endeavor, their lifes-
pans are drastically shortened.

It is difficult to explain this 

paradoxical 
phenomenon 
in 

today’s culture, because it appears 
to discourage success. But as 
Cross aptly observed, “Maybe it’s 
a generational thing.”

(And maybe Cross doesn’t 

notice the modern day trans-
gression of the term “selling out” 
because which projects he choos-
es to participate in isn’t affected 
by his fan’s reactions or unpro-
voked opinions from critics.)

Cross described his participa-

tion in commercially successful 
projects by saying “the choice is 
not to be miserable” in an inter-
view with The Believer in 2008. 
Despite what criticisms may be 
thrown his way, an individual’s 
choice to make a living from 
their passion should in no way be 
viewed as selling out.

But what can the dedicated fol-

lowers of Cross’s television and 
film career expect from his stand-
up? They should prepare for dis-
comfort and shock, but in the best 
way possible. His style is offbeat 
and challenging, but undeniably 
funny.

And so, Cross makes his return 

to stand-up in a stunning fash-
ion. As he makes his way across 
the United States, we can only 
hope that his tour will live up to 
the lofty precedent of its title. 
But in the end the final question 
remains: does Cross truly believe 
that we need to make America 
better?

“I don’t,” he wrote bluntly. “I 

was being ironic.”

SOFTBALL
‘M’ prepares for 
first tournament

By TYLER COADY

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan softball coach Carol 

Hutchins isn’t dwelling on last 
year’s Women’s College World 
Series loss to 
Florida. 
She 

also 
hasn’t 

been thinking 
about 
the 

rematch slated 
for 
Saturday 

against the top-
ranked Gators.

“The 
only 

team 
I 
am 

excited for is 
Michigan,” 
Hutchins said. 
“I never care 
who we are 
playing.”

While 

Hutchins is firmly focused on 
her Wolverines, the attention 
of collegiate softball fans this 
weekend will be on Tampa, Fla., 
as the USF Wilson-Demarini 
Tournament 
will 
pit 
No. 
2 

Michigan against South Carolina, 
Illinois State, Florida, South 
Florida and Virginia Tech.

For 
the 
Wolverines, 
this 

weekend not only marks the 
beginning of Hutchins’ 32nd year 
at the helm, but provides Michigan 
with an early chance at revenge.

The Gators, who won their 

second 
straight 
national 

championship last June, return a 
bevy of starters from last year’s 
team and boast a highly touted 
pitching 
staff 
that 
includes 

Saturday’s probable starter, right-
hander Aleshia Ocasio.

Ocasio has already racked up 

several 
memorable 
moments 

against 
the 
Wolverines. 
Her 

highlights 
include 
recording 

three strikeouts against Michigan 
in the first game of the 2015 
Women’s College World Series 
championship series and earning 
her first-ever victory for Florida 
against Michigan last February.

While Ocasio is sure to stir up 

bad memories among Wolverine 
hitters, junior outfielder Kelly 

Christner feels her team has 
shed the skeletons of last year’s 
disappointments.

“We do not need to go into 

any game any differently than 
before,” Christner said. “We have 
enough skill, we have enough 
talent … (to go) in there with high 
confidence and play normal.”

While talent will be abundant 

in the title-game rematch, it won’t 
be restricted to just that game. 
Both South Carolina and Virginia 
Tech also made last year’s NCAA 
Tournament.

Friday morning, Michigan will 

take on South Carolina, and with 
no time to rest, the Wolverines 
take 
on 
Illinois 
State 
that 

afternoon. Last year, Michigan 
defeated the Redbirds, 4-1, in the 
same tournament.

The big question for the 

Wolverines is who will be on 
the mound. With right-hander 
Megan Betsa picking up an injury 
in practice this week, there is no 
indication she will be healthy in 
time or who will fill in the gap. 
Hutchins is adamant that she 
will use the full depth of her 
pitching rotation, considering 
the team is welcoming back 
fifth-year 
right-hander 
Sara 

Driesenga and sophomore right-
hander Tera Blanco.

“We have at least 50 games 

scheduled,” Hutchins said. “We 
have a pitching staff … and for 
(Betsa) to be effective, we need 
a staff.”

If Betsa pitches against the 

Gators, the onus will fall on either 
Blanco or Driesenga on Saturday 
afternoon against South Florida. 
Last year, Michigan defeated the 
Bulls, 4-3.

While an early-season win 

against the No. 1 preseason team 
would be a statement victory 
for the Wolverines, Hutchins 
reiterated the fact that she 
refuses to focus on the hype and 
speculation that fill up the days 
leading into a new season.

“I am not going to focus on 

the other teams,” Hutchins said. 
“This is not about Florida, or 
anybody, but Michigan.”

Wolverines head to Madison

Michigan looks to 
avoid another bad 
loss in two-game 
series at Wisconsin

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

With every trip the Michigan 

hockey team takes to Madison, 
a slightly different challenge is 
presented.

The 
Kohl 

Center’s 
ice 

is 
12 
feet 

longer 
than 

the 
Yost 
Ice 

Arena’s 
rink. 

To combat the 
difference, the 
sixth-ranked 
Wolverines 
have 
been 

practicing 
at 
the 
Ann 

Arbor Ice Cube 
all 
week 
in 

preparation for 
the weekend series.

But 
Michigan 
coach 
Red 

Berenson doesn’t think it’ll be 
too much of a concern.

“You just have to get your 

bearings out there,” Berenson 
said. “If the rink is very narrow, 
you get used to that. If the rink 
is really wide, you get used to it.”

The Wolverines are coming 

off a split weekend against 
Michigan State that saw them 
lose 3-2 in overtime at Joe 
Louis Arena on Friday, before 
winning in East Lansing, 4-1, on 
Saturday.

In Friday’s game, Michigan’s 

potent offense, which averages 
4.89 goals per game, mustered 
just two goals, both coming 
off the stick of junior forward 
Tyler Motte.

Saturday, scoring was a little 

more 
balanced, 
with 
goals 

coming from Motte, line mate 
junior forward JT Compher and 
senior forward Justin Selman.

“We have to play better,” 

Berenson said of Friday night’s 
game. “You’re not always going 
to get four or five goals, and the 
other part is we have to play 

better hockey. We’re getting 
goals from one line most nights. 
It was good to see the difference 
in Saturday’s game was we got 
two goals from Selman, and 
those were big goals for us.”

The Wolverines only gave up 

four goals last weekend in their 
best defensive effort of 2016, 
but Berenson knows Michigan 
can still improve, even with the 
offense playing the way that it is.

“If 
we’re 
playing 
well 

offensively, we’re not playing 
in 
our 
(defensive) 
zone,” 

Berenson said. “But we can’t 
rely on offense. We have to be 
a legitimate defensive team in 
addition to being an exceptional 
offensive team.”

Against 
the 
Badgers, 
the 

Wolverines 
will 
once 
again 

be without freshman forward 
Cooper 
Marody, 
who 
has 

mononucleosis 
and 
has 
not 

played since Jan. 17.

In his absence, Berenson has 

shifted around the lines, moving 
sophomore forward Dexter Dancs 
to senior forward Boo Nieves’ 
line and moving Selman to center 
a line with sophomore forward 
Tony Calderone and freshman 
forward Brendan Warren.

“I think Dexter’s got a good 

chance at helping Boo’s line,” 
Berenson said. “I really like 
what Selman’s doing with the 
other line.”

And in goal, senior Steve 

Racine will protect the net. 
Racine 
has 
played 
well 
of 

late, and last Friday’s loss to 
Michigan State was his first loss 
since mid-October.

But even in the loss, Racine 

had 38 saves, 
and 
kept 

Michigan 
in 

the game when 
it needed him 
the most.

“(Racine’s) 

playing well,” 
Berenson said. 
“He’s been a 
factor 
in 
all 

of our games. 
I could show 
you the Penn State games. 
There were turning points and 
saves he made when the score 
and the game could’ve gone 

either way, so even at Michigan 
State, that game could’ve gone 
either direction. He’s giving us 
a chance every night, and that’s 
what we want from our goalie.”

On the other side of the ice, 

Wisconsin comes into the game 
coming off a sweep of Alaska. 
However, Big Ten wins have 
been a little bit harder for them 

to 
come 
by. 

The 
Badgers 

have only one 
win 
in 
the 

conference.

Forwards 

Grant 
Besse 

and 
Luke 

Kunin 
lead 

Wisconsin in 
scoring. 
The 

duo was a big 
part 
of 
the 

reason the Badgers were able to 
put the Wolverines on the ropes 
twice at Yost Ice Arena back in 
December.

Wisconsin went up by at 

least a two-goal margin in both 
games, but Michigan was able to 
come back twice, once winning, 
6-4, and once tying, 6-6.

With just nine games left 

before the Big Ten Tournament, 
the 
Wolverines 
have 
put 

themselves in a good position 
so far to contend for the Big 
Ten title and make it back to 
the NCAA Tournament after a 
three-year hiatus.

However, as evident by last 

weekend’s 
matchup 
against 

Michigan State, Michigan can’t 
take its foot off the gas pedal.

“We’ve always been a team 

that got better in the second 
half, and we’ve started to get 
better,” Berenson said. “But I 
still think we got to get better 
in the upcoming games. We 
have five tough conference 
road games we’ve got to take 
advantage of. If we do that, we’ll 
be ready.”

Michigan’s path to the ‘Big Dance’

By KELLY HALL

Daily Sports Editor

By winning Wednesday night’s 

down-to-the-wire contest at Big 
Ten bottom feeder Minnesota, 
the Michigan men’s basketball 
team avoided a near disaster that 
would’ve considerably damaged 
its NCAA Tournament hopes. As a 
projected No. 9 seed in ESPN.com’s 
Bracketology, the Wolverines (8-4 
Big Ten, 18-7 overall) aren’t on 
the bubble, necessarily, but it’s 
difficult to label them as safe.

Michigan has six conference 

games left until the Big Ten 
Tournament. Some of the contests 
are must-wins if the Wolverines 
want to land a NCAA Tournament 
berth, but others against top-25 
teams can preemptively be marked 
as big ‘L’s in the record book.

That is, unless Caris LeVert 

returns and makes an immediate 
impact. The senior guard has been 
sidelined with a lower-leg injury 
for the past 11 games.

The day before the Wolverines 

took down the Gophers in Williams 
Arena, 
Michigan 
coach 
John 

Beilein indicated that LeVert’s 
practice time was increasing, up 
to an hour at a time, but it would 
be LeVert’s decision to play. LeVert 
ultimately watched from the bench 
in a game where Michigan could 
have used his help in combating 
sluggish second-half drama.

Regardless of whether LeVert 

returns, games will continue to 
be played. The Daily broke down 
Michigan’s upcoming schedule 
and what it needs to do to make 
it to the Big Dance.

Gotta Have It

Northwestern (4-8, 16-9): 

The Wildcats have experienced 

senior leaders in guard Tre Demps 
and forward Alex Olah, but they 
somehow manage to keep losing. 
The two combine for 25.3 points 

per game and average 8.6 rebounds, 
but it’s not enough to overcome any 
Big Ten powerhouse. 

Northwestern had a few close 

games against Ohio State and took 
then-No. 7 Maryland to overtime 
on Jan. 19, but the Wildcats failed 
to close any of the nail-biters.

This is a must-win game. 

Toss-ups

Ohio State (7-5, 15-10): 

Any rivalry game comes with 

caveats, and though Michigan 
should be the favorite in this 
matchup, the contest will be held 
in Columbus in front of a fired-
up crowd. 

The Buckeyes have only one win 

against teams in the top-100 RPI, 
with their only impressive victory 

being a 74-67 defeat of then-No. 4 
Kentucky. But the Buckeyes have 
tripped more often than usual this 
season and aren’t the powerhouse 
they were the past two years, so 
don’t give them too much credit. 

Michigan will have to watch 

out for forward Marc Loving, 
who’s still averaging 13 points and 
5.3 rebounds in a very competitive 
conference. But the Buckeyes 
just don’t possess the standout 
firepower that other teams have. 

Wisconsin (7-4, 15-9): 

Wisconsin had a tumultuous 

start to the season. The Badgers 
lost early games against Western 
Illinois, 
Milwaukee 
and 

Marquette, and lost longtime 
coach Bo Ryan suddenly on Dec. 
16 when the 68-year-old coach 

announced his retirement.

Since then, Wisconsin has 

perked up, collecting wins against 
then-No. 4 Michigan State and 
then-No. 19 Indiana in January. 
The Badgers are riding a six-game 
winning streak in the conference, 
an impressive feat for any team, 
and are led by forward Nigel 
Hayes, who’s having a strong 
season, averaging 17.3 points, 5.8 
boards and 3.4 assists. 

The Wolverines will take on the 

Badgers in Madison, potentially 
spelling trouble for Michigan. 

Major Brownie Points

No. 18 Purdue (8-4, 20-5): 

Michigan already met with 

Purdue this season, and it wasn’t 
pretty. 

A well-balanced attack guided 

four different players to score 
in double-digits that day, led by 
forward A.J. Hammons, who 
scored 17 on 7-for-10 shooting. 
Though 
sophomore 
guard 

Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman 
proved himself as a valuable guard 
with a game-leading 25 points, 
his teammates were virtually 
rendered useless. 

It was an 87-70 clobbering in 

Mackey Arena. This time, the 
game will be held in Ann Arbor, 
but the Boilermakers will still 
have a steady advantage.

No. 2 Maryland (10-2, 22-3): 

The 
Terrapins 
have 
just 

two conference losses, and the 
Wolverines dealt one of them. 
Michigan 
upset 
Maryland 
at 

home in a 70-67 thriller, with 
junior forward Zak Irvin scoring 
22 points and guard Duncan 
Robinson adding 17 on 5-for-9 
3-point shooting.

But the Terrapins haven’t lost 

at home since December 2014, 
and it’s unlikely the Wolverines 
will be the ones to put an end to 
that record. With five players 
averaging double-digit scoring, it’s 
hard to imagine Michigan having 
a chance unless it hits better than 
50 percent from beyond the arc. 

No. 4 Iowa (10-2, 19-5): 

When the Wolverines traveled 

to 
Carver-Hawkeye 
Arena, 

they knew they’d be fighting 
an uphill battle. Michigan lost, 
82-71, and witnessed forward 
Jarrod Uthoff’s offensive prowess 
firsthand. Uthoff posted 23 points 
against the Wolverines. 

The Hawkeyes’ showdown with 

Michigan will be the Wolverines’ 
last contest before the Big Ten 
Tournament 
and 
will 
prove 

important in conference seeding. 

Prediction

Michigan 
will 
beat 

Northwestern and Ohio State 
to earn its berth at the NCAA 
Tournament. All of the other 
games are losable, but if LeVert 
returns, 
the 
Wolverines 
will 

find a way to win in one more 
of the contests to finish out the 
conference 
schedule 
with 
21 

victories. A win over Wisconsin 
is the most likely upset, but 
any win against the Badgers, 
Purdue, Maryland or Iowa will be 
considered an unlikely bonus.

A 
strong 
showing 
that 

includes two wins in the Big 
Ten Tournament would help the 
Wolverines, as well. Right now, if 
Michigan can continue on track 
in an admirable conference, it will 
find a way to March Madness as a 
7-10 seed.

Michigan coach John Beilein’s team, at 18-7 overall and 8-4 in the Big Ten, is in good position for the NCAA Tournament, but needs more wins to lock up a bid.

Katelynn Flaherty took one 

half to get rolling, but once 
the sophomore guard did, the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team 
followed her lead.

The 
Wolverines 
(6-7 
Big 

Ten, 14-10 overall) rallied in 
the 
second 
half, 
outscoring 

Wisconsin by 18 in the final 20 
minutes, to win their second 
consecutive game, 82-65.

The 
Badgers 
(3-10, 
7-16) 

led for most of the first half, 
keeping 
Michigan’s 
star 

weapon, Flaherty, silent for 
20 
minutes. 
Flaherty 
was 

averaging 22.7 points entering 
Thursday, but she scored just 
three in the first half.

“I wasn’t hitting shots in the 

first half, and other people were 
playing better, so I wanted to get 
the ball in their hands,” Flaherty 
said. “I got a quick basket in the 
second half. Once I get going, it 
gives me a lot of confidence … 
(Wisconsin) switched up who 
guarded me a little bit, but they 
pretty much face-guarded me 
the whole game.”

In the game prior to Wisconsin, 

against Illinois, Flaherty put up a 
career-best 36 points to reach the 
1,000-point mark.

Thursday, she scored her first 

basket on a mid-range jumper 
about seven minutes into the 
game. And despite shooting 
1-for-7 in the first half, Flaherty 
picked herself up and scored 
23, including an acrobatic and-1 
finish in the third quarter.

On the fast break in the 

second 
half, 
Flaherty, 
in 

transition, drove at the lone 
Badger guard who had made it 
back on defense. Flaherty drew 
the foul and launched the ball 
from her hip, somehow getting 
the layup to fall.

“I was just trying to draw 

the foul, really,” Flaherty said. 
“And then once it went out of 
my hands, it felt pretty good. I 

turned around, and it went in. 
It was one of the turning points 
in the game, and I think there 
were a few plays that followed 
that that really put the game in 
our favor.”

Added Michigan coach Kim 

Barnes Arico: “I have confidence 
when 
Katelynn 
takes 
those 

because, you know, she’s one of 
the best scorers in the country. I 
think (that play) was part of the 
way she was able to get going in 
the second half.”

In the first half, the Badgers’ 

extended defense took away 
Flaherty’s shot, overplaying her 
to prevent Michigan’s 3-point 
game 
from 
getting 
going. 

In the second half, Flaherty 
began to drive more, which 
opened up other options for the 
Wolverines’ offense.

Michigan’s 
post 
players 

picked 
up 
the 
slack 
while 

Flaherty struggled in the first 

half. Senior forward Kelsey 
Mitchell and freshman center 
Hallie Thome combined for 
25 points in the game, and 
junior guard and captain Siera 
Thompson had a routine night 
as well, going for 15 points, two 
assists and seven rebounds.

Michigan 
freshman 
guard 

Boogie Brozoski earned her 
second 
consecutive 
start, 

scoring nine points and dishing 
out four assists.

The matchup marked the 

penultimate 
regular-season 

game at Crisler Center this 
season. Michigan’s three seniors 
— 
Mitchell, 
guard 
Madison 

Ristovski and fifth-year guard 
Halle Wangler — could play their 
final home game next Saturday 
against Penn State.

The win puts the Wolverines 

one step closer to the .500 mark 
as the Big Ten Tournament 
looms just around the corner.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
‘M’ stymies Kelsey, Badgers

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

Wisconsin coach Bobbie Kelsey 

has one of the funniest, say-what’s-
on-her-mind personalities in the 
Big Ten. At the conference’s media 
day in October, the Daily sat down 
with her to discuss the challenges of 
the preseason and how she wanted 
to direct her program. From telling 
7-year-olds to go play when they’re 
talking on recruiting visits to 
quipping that fans shouldn’t give 
commentary on Twitter about 
how to coach, conversations with 
Kelsey are intriguing.

She 
uses 
her 
knack 
for 

conversation in her coaching 
style 
as 
well, 
often 
asking 

her players what works best 
for them so that they can be 
understood and successful. The 
Badgers played Michigan on 
Thursday night, and during the 
game, the Daily reflected on 
how well Wisconsin played in 

comparison to Kelsey’s hopes at 
the beginning of the season.

“When we stay healthy, the 

sky is the limit for this team,” 
Kelsey said. “We can shock a lot 
of people. I know other coaches 
have personally told me that 
our team is hard to play because 
we play hard. … I’m excited to 
see what our team will be like 
when we have 
everybody 
on 

our court.”

The Badgers 

have not lived 
up to Kelsey’s 
hopes 
this 

season, coming 
into 
the 

matchup against Michigan with 
a 3-9 Big Ten record. Though 
Wisconsin was within striking 
distance until halfway through 
the fourth quarter, it ran out 
of gas. The Badgers fell, 82-65, 
and were unable to shock the 
Wolverines to pull off the upset.

“Sometimes, 
we 
can 
beat 

their mental confidence down,” 
Kelsey said. “We say that we’re 
just trying to get them to work 
hard, but you have to have some 
creativity with that sometimes. 
That’s what Joe Madden does 
with the Cubs. He’s going in 
there, and they have hats with 
hands on it, breakfast on the field. 

He’s 
doing 

things 
to 

energize them 
and to get them 
to play relaxed. 
There’s 
nothing worse 
than 
playing 

tense.”

Michigan began the contest 

with a three-quarter court press 
on defense, and Wisconsin had 
moments of both success and 
failure maneuvering through it 
all game. But in nearly every trip 
up the court, the Badgers looked 
tense. In the first half alone, 
the Badgers committed nine 
turnovers. As the Wolverine press 
continued on, Wisconsin finished 
with 13 turnovers, less tense 
in the second half. Though the 
Badgers took better care of the 
ball, they turned it over in crucial 
moments when they needed a run 
to climb back into the game.

“I don’t want them to be out 

there goofing around,” Kelsey 
said. “But certainly, I want a 
relaxed urgency. Your hair is not 
on fire.”

The Badgers came out of the 

gate firing on all cylinders, starting 
on a 12-4 run in the first five 
minutes of the game. The scoring 
slowed down after the Wolverines’ 
defensive pressure intensified, as 
Wisconsin managed to tally 37 
points going into halftime leading 
by one. Down by double digits in 
the fourth quarter, the Badgers 
kept fighting to cut the deficit to 
as little as five when the contest 
was coming to a close and were 
outscored 23-14 in the final stanza.

“If they know what they’re 

doing, you don’t have to stress,” 
Kelsey said. “You know what 
you’re supposed to be doing, 
everybody 
knows 
their 
role, 

getting the ball in the post, sharing 
the ball, things of that nature.”

“I want a relaxed 

urgency.”
