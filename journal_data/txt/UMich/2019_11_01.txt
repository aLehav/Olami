ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Residents 
are 
still 
struggling 
to 
clear 
their 
records 
for 
marijuana 
convictions nearly a year after 
a ballot measure legalizing 
the drug passed statewide, 
and Ann Arbor, despite its 
historically progressive stance 
on the issue, is no exception.
In 1972, Ann Arbor City 
Council passed an ordinance 
that made the possession of 
small amounts of marijuana a 
civil infraction, or just a small 
fine. However, The Daily filed 
for a Freedom of Information 
Act and found there were 317 
marijuana-related 
arrests 
made by the Ann Arbor Police 
Department between 2016 and 
2018. There are still more than 
235,000 Michigan residents 
with 
records 
relating 
to 
low-level marijuana use and 
possession.
After 
Michigan 
passed 
Proposal 1 last year legalizing 
recreational marijuana, some 
Michigan 
legislators 
have 
worked to ensure people with 
drug offenses do not continue 
to suffer the consequences. 
Over the past few years, 
15 states have passed bills 

expunging minor marijuana 
convictions. In 2019 alone, 
Illinois, 
Nevada, 
New 
Hampshire and Washington 
have all passed legislation that 
allows a person to petition 
their 
conviction. 
In 
some 
cases, like in Washington, 
misdemeanor 
charges 
are 
completely vacated. 
Former 
Michigan 
state 
Rep. 
Sherry 
Gay-Dagnogo, 
D-Detroit; 
state 
Sen. 
Jeff 
Irwin, 
D-Ann 
Arbor; 
and 
state 
Rep. 
Yousef 
Rabhi, 
D-Ann Arbor, have all been 
on the forefront of expanding 
criminal 
expungement 
for 
certain 
misdemeanor 
and 
felony charges that weren’t 
assaultive crimes, such as 
the possession of marijuana. 
Other supporters of the bills 
include Reps. Eric Leutheuser, 
R-Hillsdale; Pauline Wendzel, 
R-Watervliet; David LaGrand, 
D-Grand Rapids; and Luke 
Meerman, R-Coopersville. 
In 
addition, 
Rabhi 
wrote part of a bipartisan 
expungement 
package 
in 
the House, which includes 
measures aimed at eliminating 
small-time drug offenses that 
could hurt one’s ability to get 
a well-paying job or apply for 
housing.

Michigan representatives consider steps to 
expunge records of people with criminal 
misdemeanor or felony non-assualt charges

Ann Arbor ranks among U.S. 
metro areas most affected by 
student loan debt, according 
to a recent study conducted 
by 
SmartAsset, 
a 
financial 
technology company.
The study put Ann Arbor 
as number 15 in metro areas 
where student loan debt hits 
the hardest, the number one 
area being Gainesville, Fla. The 
average student loan debt for an 
Ann Arbor citizen is $45,668, 
compared to $35,359 nationally. 
A.J. Smith, vice president 
of 
financial 
education 
for 
SmartAsset, 
oversaw 
the 
research. In an interview with 
The Daily, Smith said SmartAsset 
used a team of data analysts and 
personal finance experts to look 
at 100 metro areas in the United 
States.
“Paying off loans can impact 
your financial life and your 
future financial goals,” Smith 
said. “This is the first year 
that we did this study to find 
where student loan debt hit the 
hardest.”
The research used five key 
metrics 
in 
determining 
the 
rankings. These included average 
student 
loan 
debt, 
median 
earnings for bachelor’s degree

Pseudo local news sites reveal nationally expanding network

Following the 2016 election 
season, Americans realized 
the powerful influence of 
fake news, with the nation at 
large questioning the extent 
to which it may have swayed 
the 
election. 
With 
2020 
elections just around the 

corner, Michigan’s critical 
role as a swing state has made 
the 
community 
especially 
wary of politically motivated 
news stories. 
First reported Oct. 20 by the 
Lansing State Journal, nearly 
40 websites have appeared 
this 
fall, 
masquerading 
as 
local 
Michigan 
news 
outlets and maintaining a 
conservative-leaning tone.

The different websites are 
nearly 
indistinguishable, 
sharing identical stories and 
using regional titles such as 
the Ann Arbor Times, Grand 
Rapids Reporter and Lansing 
Sun. The only articles with 
named 
authors 
contain 
politically skewed content. 
The rest of the articles on the 
sites are primarily composed 
of press releases from local 

organizations 
and 
articles 
written by the Local Labs 
News Service. 
Articles featured on the 
websites include a summary 
of a report by the conservative 
think-tank 
Heritage 
Foundation, a story about the 
failure of U.S. Rep. Rashida 
Tlaib’s, D-Mich., to rally a 
crowd at a pro-impeachment 
event and a front-page piece 

about Michigan Republicans 
supporting President Donald 
Trump.
Each site has an identical 
“About Us” page, explaining 
the site is “one of hundreds” 
being launched nationwide 
to allegedly “fill the void in 
local communities,” due to 
the steady decline of local 
reporting. “Our approach,” 
the page continues, “is to 

provide 
objective, 
data-
driven information without 
personal or political bias. 
We let the facts speak for 
themselves.”
Just 
this 
past 
week, 

additional 
statewide 

networks of these websites 
have sprung up in Montana 
and Iowa.

Nearly 40 websites masquerade as community outlets across Michigan while promoting conservative views

Notre Dame game brings record-
breaking number of Airbnb guests

Last weekend’s football game draws 2,390 people, brings in $735,000

In 
anticipation 
of 
the 
Michigan-Notre Dame football 
game 
last 
weekend, 
Airbnb 
welcomed 2,390 guests to Ann 
Arbor from Oct. 25 to 27, marking 
the largest influx of guests in 
Ann Arbor’s Airbnb history. 
Hosts saw more than $735,000 in 

supplemental income, according 
to a press release from Airbnb.
According 
to 
Airbnb 
spokesperson 
Sam 
Randall, 
the last time Ann Arbor saw 
a record-breaking number of 
guest arrivals was just over 
three weeks ago when Michigan 
played Iowa for the annual 
homecoming game. 
The number of guests staying 

in Ann Arbor through Airbnb 
has significantly increased over 
the past year. Last year’s 2018 
homecoming 
game 
against 
Maryland 
brought 
in 
1,450 
guest arrivals, while this year’s 
homecoming game against Iowa 
brought in 2,260 guest arrivals, 
marking a 56 percent increase. 
Comparing the 2018 Maryland 
game to the Notre Dame game 

with 2,390 guests, this is a 
65 percent increase overall, 
according to Randall. 
“(Iowa) would’ve been the 
second-highest 
guest 
arrival 
amount in Ann Arbor, but this 
weekend has eclipsed that by 
a few hundred guest arrivals,” 
Randall said.

holders, average student debt as 
a percentage of median earnings 
for bachelor’s degree holders, 
percentage of tax return with 
student loan interest deduction 
and the unemployment rate for 
those with a bachelor’s degree, 

Smith said. The study also used 
data from Experian, the United 
States Census and the Internal 
Revenue 
Service 
in 
their 
research.
According 
to 
SmartAsset, 
student loan debt is the second-

largest form of consumer debt in 
the United States. Student loan 
debt reached $1.4 trillion, an 
all-time high, in the first three 
months of 2019, according to 
data from Experian. This is a 116 
percent increase from 10 years 

prior.

sophomore 
Gabi Tringali is an out-of-state 
student paying for her tuition 
entirely by herself. She has 
taken out federal student loans 
and said she will be taking out 

more after this school year to 
cover the rest of her tuition. 
Tringali said thinking about 
her future student loan debt is 
frightening.

With the official signing 
date 
for 
Sept. 
1 
leases 
looming, 
many 
students 
on campus are searching 
for places to live. But the 
housing hunt looks different 
for transfer students at the 
University of Michigan.
According to University 
Housing, 
97 
percent 
of 
first-year 
students 
choose 
to live on-campus for their 
first 
year. 
But 
transfer 
students are not guaranteed 
on-campus 
housing 
upon 
admission to the University 
due to the limited number 
of rooms and space available 
for students. Some living 

communities — such as the 
Transfer 
Year 
Experience 
Theme 
Community 
at 
Northwood III apartments — 
are reserved exclusively for 
transfer students.
In 
an 
email 
to 
The 
Daily, 
Amir 
Baghdadchi, 
senior 
associate 
director 
of 
University 
Housing 
Administration, 
explained 
what housing options are 
available to transfer students.
“As soon as a transfer 
student takes care of their 
official 
enrollment, 
that 
automatically 
generates 
an invitation to apply for 
Housing,” Baghdachi wrote. 
“Once you’ve filled that out 
and are in the system, you can 
check out the website over a 
period to check out what we 

have. Our inventory changes 
over spring and summer, so 
we typically invite transfer 
students to continually check 
from 
mid-March 
through 
mid-August, to see what’s 
new.”
When LSA senior Michael 
Koch’s transfer application to 
the University was accepted 
in February 2017, he received 
a link to an online web portal 
to 
apply 
for 
on-campus 
housing. 
Though 
Koch 
wanted to live on-campus, he 
was unable to find space on 
Central Campus and opted 
to live in University Towers 
instead. 
“I checked (the website) 
every day from February to 
maybe June, and the only 
housing was available on 
North Campus,” Koch 
said. “But I had friends 
who went here and they 
said, ‘Whatever you do, 
do not live on North 
Campus 
if 
you’re 
in 
LSA.’”
LSA 
senior 
Megan 
Quayle 
transferred 
to 
Michigan as a sophomore 
and also wanted to live 
in on-campus housing 
on Central Campus. She 
said after she searched 
for a place to live, she 
ultimately decided on an 
off-campus 
apartment 
complex.
“In general, it just 
felt like we got kind of 
thrown 
into 
housing 
because the University 
doesn’t guarantee any 
housing 
for 
transfer 
students, so you kind of 
need to figure out where 
you can fit into housing 
somewhere, 
whether 
that be on-campus if 
there are openings or 
off-campus and try to 
navigate that,” Quayle 

said. 
In addition to the housing 
opportunities 
disparity, 
Quayle said her orientation 
experience differed greatly 
from 
regularly 
admitted 
students. 
According 
to 
Quayle, 
orientation 
for 
transfer 
students 
occurs 
on a single day in July or 
August, 
partly 
because 
they 
had 
previously 
attended an institution of 
higher 
education. 
Their 
orientation 
focused 
on 
becoming accustomed to the 
University and registering 
for classes, but Quayle felt 
that 
some 
assistance 
or 
information on determining 
housing also would have 
been useful before attending 
orientation.
“It was kind of too late 
in the game to talk about 
housing, but I wish there had 
been something else before 
(orientation),” Quayle said.
LSA senior Skylar Carlson 
transferred to the University 
with her sister in the fall of 
2018. She initially wanted 
to find a place to live off-
campus, but because she was 
accepted in the late spring 
of 2018, she said she found it 
difficult to find an available 
space in her price range. 
“It 
was 
kind 
of 
overwhelming and kind of 
frustrating,” 
Carlson 
said. 
“Everything in Ann Arbor 
is just super expensive, and 
it was my first time moving 
out and living on my own, 
so I guess it was hard to find 
resources to actually find 
somewhere to live.”
Since her sister was in the 
College of Engineering, the 
two ultimately decided to live 
at Northwood III on North 
Campus.

B E HIND THE STORY

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, Engineering senior 
Alice Tracey reported on a new program created by the Office of 
Fraternity and Sorority Life to combat toxic masculinity.

“I was particularly interested in the aspect of the story that dealt with 
fraternities, because I always have this stereotype that frat guys are 
super masculine, unemotional, don’t care about talking about gender 
stereotypes. But talking to some frat guys for this story really disproved 
that for me. I found out that these guys are super interested in thinking 
about how their gender plays into their actions and how masculine 
socialization affects them. And I thought that was really powerful, it 
really proved me wrong.”

Alice Tracey, Daily Staff Reporter

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
People in our communities have overcome redlining, systemic 
racism only to see their water shut off. Their homes taken away, simply 
because they’re too poor to afford shelter, or fell on hard times. We live 
in the Motor City, the region that gave the world the automobile, and 
yet many of us — many of us — cannot afford to insure the cars we 
drive because insurance companies are allowed to discriminate against 
us.”

U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Detroit, speaking during a campaign rally for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie 
Sanders

The 
websites 
were 
all 
published by Locality Labs, 
LLC on behalf of their client, 
the Metric Media Foundation, 
according to a Locality Labs 
employee 
who 
wished 
to 
remain anonymous. Locality 
Labs already operates its own 
networks of similar websites 
in Maryland and Florida.
The 
Metric 
Media 
Foundation, 
a 
non-profit, 
501(c)(3) 
organization 
registered in Missouri earlier 
this year, only lists a Kansas 
City-based attorney on its 
filings, 
though 
an 
online 
biography 
lists 
Bradley 
Cameron as its CEO. The 
biography describes Cameron 
as being a strategist “presently 
retained 
by 
national 
conservative leaders to direct 
responses 
to 
government 
targeting of their operations 
and initiatives.” 
Locality Labs, the company 
building 
the 
websites, 
emerged out of Journatic, LLC 
and BlockShopper, LLC — 
two now-defunct companies 
with histories mired in ethics 
concerns. 
Tribune Media Company, a 

media conglomerate that once 
owned major outlets including 
the Chicago Tribune and the 
Los Angeles Times, invested 
in Journatic as a service to 
provide 
hyperlocal 
news 
coverage. Journatic reportedly 
distributed 
fabricated 
and 
plagiarized content and used 
workers in the Philippines 
writing 
under 
pseudonyms 
to remotely produce stories. 
Due to these scandals, many 
outlets suspended their use 
of the service and stopped 
publishing Journatic articles. 
Tribune Media has since 
been absorbed by Nexstar 
Media Group, Inc., the largest 
local television and media 
company in the U.S., but 
still has not fully divested 
from the venture, which has 
since reorganized as Locality 
Labs. The Daily requested 
comment from Gary Weitman, 
chief 
communications 
officer at Nexstar, regarding 
investment in Locality Labs, 
and was told Locality Labs 
was not a subsidiary. While 
acknowledging 
Nexstar 
does partially own Locality 
Labs, Weitman downplayed 
the influence of Nexstar’s 
investment. 
“We have very, very, very 
small ownership stake in the 

company,” Weitman wrote. 
Locality Labs CEO Brian 
Timpone has a long history 
of facing ethical questions 
regarding 
his 
enterprises. 
When asked about one of his 
ventures in 2004, he told the 
Washington Post, “I’m a biased 
guy. I’m a Republican.” Brian 
Timpone did not respond to a 
request for comment from The 
Daily. 
Timpone 
is 
also 
the 
co-founder 
of 
Local 
Government 
Information 
Services, a network of more 
than 30 Illinois print and 
web publications that have 
been considered to propagate 
conservative news and hold 
an identical layout to Metric 
Media’s websites. 
Before 
the 
conception 
of LGIS, Timpone founded 
Newsinator Receivable, LLC. 
Newsinator began producing 
publications LGIS has since 
acquired and has come under 
fire for engaging in paid 
political and marketing work. 
In 
2016, 
the 
Liberty 
Principles PAC, a conservative 
super PAC established by Dan 
Proft, a conservative radio 
personality and co-founder 
of 
LGIS, 
provided 
almost 
$200,000 to Newsinator for 
the sake of mailing print 

publications to voters. 
That 
same 
year, 
Think 
Freely Media, a nonprofit 
supporting 
“limited 
government” in which Proft 
has served as a consultant, 
funneled 
almost 
$350,000 
to Newsinator to aid in the 
creation of their websites. 
Think Freely is prohibited 
by law from spending on 
politicking due to its status as 
a nonprofit, but has described 
the 
articles 
it 
funded 
as 
strictly news content. 
In 
addition 
to 
these 
enterprises, 
Timpone 
is 
associated 
with 
Franklin 
Archer, 
a 
publishing 
organization operated from 
Chicago. 
Franklin 
Archer 
hosts a similar network which 
consists of a set of nationwide 
business 
journals. 
Earlier 
this year, Franklin Archer 
published the Hinsdale School 
News — a publication that 
infringed upon the name and 
logo trademarks of Hinsdale 
High 
School 
District 
86 
in Illinois and potentially 
violated 
election 
law 
by 
attempting to influence the 
vote on a $140 million school 
district referendum. 

“I feel like Northwood is 
kind of the only option, but 
the downfall is that it is on 
North Campus, and that’s 
not ideal for anyone who’s 
not an Engineering student,” 
Carlson added.
Baghdadchi wrote in his 
email that transfer students 
are given the freedom to 
pick the kind of housing that 
works for them. 
“For all students across 
campus, space in residence 
halls 
and 
apartments 
is 
limited, 
so 
we 
don’t 
guarantee a room will be 
available,” Baghdadchi said. 
“‘Transfer students really 
have different needs based 
on where they are in their 
academic careers, and the 
kind 
of 
experience 
they 
are looking for. So in our 
process, transfer students 

can browse online and select 
for themselves from what’s 
available.”
Koch commented on how 
students find a place to live 
for the following year during 
the fall of the previous year, 
wishing 
there 
was 
more 
transparency about that to 
transfer students. 
“I think it’s very unusual 
that (in) Michigan and Ann 
Arbor in general, everybody 
knows where they’re living 
by mid-October,” Koch said. 
“So when you’re accepted 
as a transfer student in 
February, 
you’re 
already 
months behind the game, 
and that expectation wasn’t 
made clear by the University. 
At the same time, they don’t 
control 
when 
people 
get 
houses, like it’s not their job 
to regulate the off-campus 
housing market to make sure 
that transfer students can 
find a place.”

“I know everyone’s like, ‘Oh, 
you’re going to get such a great 
job and pay off your loan,’ but 
you never know what’s going 
to happen, and it has put so 
much pressure on me to do 
well,” Tringali said. “You want 
to do well, but (having student 
loans) puts so much more 
pressure on doing well and 
getting internships just so you 
are sure that you’re going to get 
a job after college, or else you 
will be left with all of this debt 
and have to pay it off.”
Tringali works at Staples 16 
hours a week to help pay for 
her tuition. She said having 
a job often makes it difficult 
to balance her time between 
studying and being involved 
with activities.
Like Tringali, LSA junior 
Victoria Sheetz has taken out 
student loans to pay for her 
tuition. She said she tries to 
keep the thought of her future 
student loan debt in the back of 
her mind. 

“As of right now, I try not 
to think about it as much as 
I can,” Sheetz said. “But it is 
definitely something I will 
think about after school, and 
how I’m going to pay them off, 
and if I’m going to be able to do 
so with minimal impact to all 
the other things I will have to 
pay for.”
The study found college 
towns are disproportionately 
affected by student loan debt, 
Smith said. The majority of 
cities listed ahead of Ann 
Arbor are also college towns, 
such 
as 
Gainesville, 
Fla., 
Durham-Chapel Hill, N.C. and 
Colombia, Mo.
Living in Ann Arbor, Tringali 
said she often sees issues with 
the cost of activities.
“On a social level, sometimes 
there’s times where everyone 
wants to go get food or go do 
this activity,” Tringali said. 
“You don’t want to say ‘no’ and 
be a downer because it’s Ann 
Arbor; there’s so much to do.”
Ann Arbor also has a shortage 
of affordable housing. Sheetz 
said the high price of living in 
Ann Arbor is outrageous.

“The cost of living, including 
rent 
and 
bills 
and 
other 
groceries … just to get an 
education at a good school is 
kind of ridiculous,” Sheetz 
said. 
The University of Michigan’s 
Office of Financial Aid website 
advises students to think ahead 
to the time they will begin to 
repay their student loans. The 
website also offers information 
on how to manage student loans 
after graduation, and the OFA 
offers walk-in appointments to 
help with financial planning.
Laura Rall, Rackham student 
and president of Affordable 
Michigan, 
will 
have 
taken 
out four student loans by the 
time she graduates with a 
master’s degree in May. She 
wrote in a statement to The 
Daily on behalf of herself, not 
Affordable Michigan, that she 
thought the University could 
play a bigger role in helping 
students financially plan and 
should put forth more effort 
in reaching out to students to 
discuss their loans and offer 
guidance.
“It’s easy for U-M to look 

at the numbers and assume 
that because the majority of 
students come from wealthy 
family 
backgrounds, 
that 
students know and understand 
what they are doing with loans, 
but that is not always the case,” 
Rall wrote. “There are a lot of 
misconceptions 
surrounding 
loans and college finances and 
I do wish the University would 
take more action in educating 
and guiding students through 
the process.”
To help manage student 
loan debt, Smith said it is a 
good idea to talk to a financial 
adviser to create an overall 
financial 
picture. 
She 
said 
it is also important to set up 
an 
emergency 
fund 
before 
attacking student loan debt 
more aggressively.
“It’s very important to run 
the numbers and not hide from 
them,” Smith said. “It’s much 
more empowering to actually 
run the numbers, take a look 
at them, make a plan and start 
taking action towards that 
plan, even if it’s a very small 
amount each month.”

“Most of this applies to 
people who are no longer 
in jail or in a prison, people 
that 
have 
completed 
their sentences, that have 
completed their probation, 
that have completed their 
parole, but that still have 
those 
offenses 
on 
their 
record,” Rabhi said in an 
interview with The Daily. 
“And that is problematic of 
course because when you 
apply for a job, when you 
apply for housing and you 
still have that crime on your 
record, it is nearly impossible 
to find a good job, or even to 
find good housing.”
Yet, 
even 
if 
Ann 
Arbor 
enacts 
these 
anti-
discrimination 
regulations 
for housing companies, it’s 
unclear how city council will 
guarantee companies abide 
to the new protocol. City 
Councilmember 
Elizabeth 
Nelson, 
D-Ward 
4, 
said 
ensuring housing companies 
do not discriminate can be 
difficult to enforce.
“The big challenge for us 
is enforcement,” Nelson said. 
“So, any housing issue, we 
can make a rule about it, but 
how are we going to enforce 
it? We can make policies 
of anti-discrimination, but 
the question is, who’s going 
to come to us and say, ‘We 
experienced 
this, 
what’s 
the penalty?’ If I have a 
record and I’m going to 
rent an apartment and I get 
rejected, is there a process 
for me to go to the city and 
file a complaint? Is there 
a process for the city to 
impose 
some 
consequence 
on that landlord? That’s the 
challenge.”
Among the other bills in 
the package are measures 
that 
would 
expedite 
the 
otherwise lengthy and costly 
process 
of 
expungement. 
There are many steps, such as 
notarizing an application and 
mailing copies to prosecutors 
and law enforcement, that 
prevent 
ex-offenders 
from 
even applying. 
According 
to 
a 
2019 
study done by University 
of Michigan law professors 
Sonja 
B. 
Starr 
and 
J.J. 
Prescott, over 90 percent 
of people who qualify for 
expungement 
neglect 
to 
appeal their convictions.
Rabhi 
also 
noted 
how 
this 
is 
largely 
because 
expungement can currently 
cost 
hundreds 
if 
not 
thousands of dollars in legal 
fees. 
Rabhi 
said 
passing 
legislation on expungement 
would alleviate this problem. 
“One of the biggest things 
is that a lot of people cannot 
afford to get their records 
expunged because it’s costly,” 
Rabhi said. “You have to go 
to an attorney and get them 
to help you, and obviously 
attorneys 
charge 
you 
for 
that, so the vast majority of 
people who are eligible to get 
their records expunged don’t. 
And so one of the bills in the 
package creates an automatic 
expungement 
process, 
so 
that peoples’ records can be 
automatically 
expunged 
if 
they’re eligible, without them 
having to apply or petition for 
expungement.” 
Rabhi also acknowledges 

that in many cases, crimes 
like possession and sale of 
marijuana do not occur in a 
vacuum. Oftentimes, drug-
related crimes can occur 
in conjunction with other 
infractions — non-assaultive 
crimes 
or 
misdemeanors 
— a person may not have 
committed before, but that 
can 
permanently 
damage 
their record. According to 
Rabhi, 
the 
expungement 
package deals particularly 
with people who may only 
have committed one crime, 
like 
small 
time 
robbery, 
can be faced with dozens of 
various charges. 

“Oftentimes 
what 

happens is, honestly — is the 
prosecutors 
overcharge,” 
Rabhi said. “They’ll find a 
bunch of different crimes 
that somebody did and they’ll 
heap them on.”
Rabhi used the personal 
example of his 2007 arrest 
for protesting the use of 
sweatshops in the production 
of U-M apparel. According to 
Rabhi, after he and a number 
of other protesters occupied 
a University building, he was 
faced with a multitude of 
various charges.
“They 
heaped 
up 
two 
misdemeanors on top of each 
other,” Rabhi said. “That’s 
what they do. And so this 
‘One Bad Night’ bill, if I 
had been convicted of both 
misdemeanors, 
then 
those 
would count as one for the 
purposes of expungement.”
However, newly appointed 
Ann 
Arbor 
Police 
Chief 
Michael Cox said he does 
not know how much of an 
impact the new legislations 
would have on Ann Arbor, 
as 
cannabis 
has 
been 
“deemphasized” for almost 
50 years within in Ann Arbor.
“Drugs in general have 
been deemphasized in a lot of 
ways, but some of the things 
that come around it, you 
know, whether the people 
who make money from it 
— not legally but illegally — 
they tend to do other things, 
too, 
whether 
it’s 
carry 
firearms illegally, maybe rob 
other people,” Cox said. “So, 
we still have to pay attention 
to that. I think personally, it 
just helps us focus more on 
real crime so to speak.”
Lily Tushman, LSA junior 
and president of the Prison 
Birth Project, is optimistic 
about the future of these 
bills, 
even 
though 
they 
might only affect a small 
number of people in Ann 
Arbor. She cited the fact 
that 
these 
effects 
would 
greatly aid people of color. 
According to MLive, “black 
men age 18 to 24 are almost 
10 times more likely to be 
arrested 
for 
marijuana 
offenses compared to white 
women that age, even though 
marijuana 
usages 
rates 
between the two groups are 
only fractionally different.”
“I think the expungement 
proposal is an important step 
towards addressing the racial 
disparities 
in 
marijuana 
charges 
and 
sentencing,” 
Tushman said. “Making it 
automatic also removes some 
of the cost and time barriers 
people face when they have to 
deal with the court system to 
get their record expunged.”

University announces winter commencement 
speakers and honorary degree recipients

“This is the highest ever 
in Ann Arbor.” 
According 
to 
Airbnb, 
guests from all over the 
country traveled to Ann 
Arbor for game day, with the 
highest number of guests 
coming from the cities of 
Chicago, 
New 
York, 
San 
Francisco and Atlanta.
During big game weekends, 
hotels 
frequently 
reach 
peak occupancy, allowing 
Airbnb 
to 
significantly 
expand its lodging capacity 
through 
owner-occupied 
homes, where guests will 
temporarily rent out a room 
or a certain amount of space. 
This also allows these hosts 
to bring in extra income, 
as they can charge visitors 

to stay in a part of their 
home that may typically be 
unoccupied. 
The 
guests 
don’t 
just 
provide a financial boon 
for their hosts. According 
to 
Airbnb 
data, 
visitors 
provide an economic boost 
to the greater community, 
as they typically spend on 
average $110 per day at local 
restaurants and stores. 
In a statement, Airbnb 
Midwest 
policy 
director 
Kelley Gossett said Airbnb 
was glad to help football 
fans find places to stay.
“It’s clear, both of these 
teams 
enjoy 
nationwide 
fan bases that will travel 
to see the game. Airbnb is 
proud to help facilitate that 
travel while providing an 
economic opportunity for 
hosts and bringing revenue 
to the area,” Gossett said.

U-M football fan Casey 
Miranda 
traveled 
from 
Grand Rapids, Mich., and 
chose to stay with friends in 
an Airbnb for the weekend. 
Miranda said the experience 
was more enjoyable than 
staying at a hotel.
“It’s been an awesome 
experience,” 
Miranda 
said. “We have great hosts; 
they’re amazing. Everything 
has been waiting for us, 
Michigan 
paraphernalia 
everywhere. 
It 
was 
amazing.” 
However, not all guests 
said they preferred Airbnbs 
to traditional hotels. U-M 
football fan Bobby Cooke 
traveled 
from 
Charlotte, 
North Carolina and booked 
an Airbnb about five weeks 
in advance of his stay with 
several other guests. He 
said he would typically try 

to arrange a stay at a hotel 
but most had already been 
booked for the weekend. 
“We 
chose 
an 
Airbnb 
just because we couldn’t 
find anything close to the 
downtown 
area,” 
Cooke 
said. “It was the only option 
we had. Normally, I would 
not go for that. I would go 
for something like a hotel 
or 
something 
closer 
to 
campus.”
He said the Airbnb he 
rented was inconvenient due 
to extra travel costs to get to 
campus.
“The Airbnb is about 30 
minutes from here, which 
has not been very convenient 
because 
we’re 
having 
to 
Uber back and forth, and 
that’s 
expensive,” 
Cooke 
said. “I would say it’s been 
unremarkable at the most.”

A single narrative’s danger

RILEY DEHR | COLUMN

F

rom preserving peace 
in war-torn countries 
to providing a forum for 
diplomacy and helping to build 
a more sustainable future, the 
United Nations is a critically 
important 
organization. 
However, the U.N.’s ability 
to do this work is threatened 
because the United States is 
refusing to pay its share of the 
U.N. budget. 
The secretary general of 
the United Nations, António 
Guterres, announced that the 
U.N. is facing a severe budget 
shortfall that will impact it in 
a many ways. He warned that 
the U.N. might not be able 
to continue to pay its staff 
members and will have to 
cut back on many important 
programs and services. 
The U.N.’s annual budget 
is supposed to be funded 
by the 193 member states. 
Unfortunately, many members 
have not paid their annual 
dues and are pushing the 
U.N. toward financial crisis. 
The United States owes about 
$1.055 billion in past and 
present dues. 
The Trump administration 
has been a major factor in 
the 
accumulation 
of 
these 
debts. President Trump has 
repeatedly targeted the U.N. 
budget and has tried to cut 
funding in the past. One of his 
main complaints is that the 
United States pays too high a 
percentage of the U.N. budget. 
The real contribution to the 
U.N. of each country depends 
on GDP, population and other 
factors. As the nation with 
the highest GDP in the world, 
it is only reasonable that 
the United States is asked to 
supply the largest share of the 
U.N. budget. 
Additionally, the argument 
that the United States pays too 
much for the U.N. is undercut 

when looking at how much 
money the U.S. government 
spends on other things. The 
roughly $1 billion that the 
United States owes the U.N. 
is 0.1355 percent of the U.S. 
military’s $738 billion fiscal 
year 2020 budget. If we can 
commit so much money to our 
military, there is no excuse 
for not committing such a 
proportionately small amount 
to foster peace and prosperity 
around the world. 

One of the most costly and 
disruptive cuts the U.N. is 
facing is the slashing of the 
hours when meetings can be 
held. International crises do 
not run on a 9-to-5 schedule. 
If committees needed to meet 
after hours, they would have 
to do so without the necessary 
support staff, as there would be 
no money to pay for overtime. 
One 
of 
the 
key 
global 
issues the U.N. works on is 
the 
fight 
against 
climate 
change. 
They 
have 
done 
everything 
from 
promoting 
sustainable development goals 
to hosting a youth climate 
summit with youth activist 
Greta Thunberg. The U.N. 
also 
runs 
other 
important 
programs, such as the World 
Health Organization, which 
helps 
fight 
the 
spread 
of 
disease. The ability to run 
these important programs is 
severely threatened by the 

U.N.’s budget crisis. 
In addition to withholding 
funds for the U.N. general 
budget, 
the 
U.S. 
is 
also 
withholding 
some 
funds 
for the U.N. peacekeeping 
program. The peacekeeping 
program is one of the most 
important U.N. initiatives, 
sending experts to promote 
peace in some of the world’s 
most volatile regions. The 
United States is supposed 
to provide over 28 percent 
of the annual peacekeeping 
budget. However, the United 
States is now only paying 25 
percent. While this 3 percent 
difference may not seem like 
much, 3 percent can translate 
to a significant amount of 
money. 
Moreover, 
even 
though 
the United States is asked to 
give the largest amount to the 
peacekeeping budget, other 
countries pay by contributing 
peacekeepers. In 2019, only 
35 peacekeepers came from 
the United States. This is a 
minimal amount compared to 
many other nations, such as 
the 7,052 from Ethiopia and 
the 5,668 from Nepal. These 
peacekeepers put themselves 
in harm’s way, and at least 
3,866 peacekeepers have been 
killed since the founding of 
the program in 1948. 
As 
students, 
there 
are 
many things that we can do 
to try to push the United 
States to meet its full funding 
commitment to the U.N. You 
can call your congressional 
representative and ask them to 
commit to advocating for U.N. 
funding. You also can also join 
the University of Michigan 
UNAUSA club, which works to 
promote the work of the U.N. 
on campus.

End the ban on gay blood
T

he confused and mildly 
embarrassed 
nurse 
rushed out of the tent. 
“I’ve never seen this before. 
Let me go get the doctor.” 
The computer I was doing 
my health evaluation on the 
minute 
before 
now 
read, 
“Error.”
I had clicked through a few 
mundane questions to see if I 
could give blood in our high 
school’s annual blood drive, 
something of a senior class 
ritual. 
“Male, 
Female, 
Other.” 
Male. 
“Are you on antibiotics?” 
No. 
Then, it asked me a rather 
personal question. 
“Have you been sexually 
active in the past twelve 
months?”
I thought it was an oddly 
kinky 
question 
for 
the 
Red Cross, but I answered 
honestly.
Yes. 
The computer then began to 
hit on me: “Were you sexually 
active with men or women?”
I knew it wasn’t a good 
sign that they were asking 
the 
question. 
But, 
I 
had 
recently learned to be proud 
of my gayness (a skill in rural 
Nebraska) and clicked the 
“Men” box with butterflies 
in my stomach. Immediately, 
the computer punished my 
honesty with “Please wait for 
a nurse.” 
Now, as I sat waiting for the 
doctor, I wished I would have 
lied. After 10 minutes, a young 
blonde woman in a crisp, 
white uniform walked into the 
tent. “I’m sorry it took so long, 
we’ve been swamped.” She 
looked at the computer and 
then down at me. I blushed at 
my answers and tried to hide 
my nervousness as I prepared 
myself for her reaction.
Luckily, 
she 
was 
sympathetic and explained 
to me the government’s ban 
on drawing blood from men 
who have sex with men. “It’s 
stupid. I know.” I nodded, 
pretending to listen as I 
panicked over what I was 
going 
to 
tell 
my 
friends 
and 
classmates 
waiting 
outside. She apologized and 
ushered me back out into 
the gymnasium, temporarily 
converted into a makeshift 
blood bank. My friends and 
classmates 
flocked 
around 
me, curious as to why I 

wasn’t 
giving 
blood 
after 
enthusiastically talking about 
it all week. 
 
“I 
forgot 
I’m 
on 
antibiotics!” I stammered as I 
chose a suitable lie to save me 
from the embarrassing truth. 
I felt like I had been punished 
for trying to do a selfless deed. 
Even so, I couldn’t help but 
laugh at the ridiculousness of 
the situation as I remembered 
an episode of “Degrassi: The 
Next Generation” (the one 
with wheelchair Drake) I had 
seen as an angsty tween that 
almost perfectly reflected my 
situation. The synopsis of the 
episode 
Moonlight 
Desires 
reads, “Marco is upset when 
he discovers he is unable to 
donate blood at the blood 
drive because he is gay and 
then catches Dylan in bed 
with another guy.” I couldn’t 
believe 
that 
my 
life 
had 
temporarily become a 2005 
episode of a Canadian teen 
drama. 

The 
situation 
eventually 
lost its humor though, as it 
became replaced by a feeling 
of disbelief. Why was the 
government banning a high 
schooler 
from 
trying 
to 
donate blood? The ban’s roots 
can be found in today’s decade 
of problematic nostalgia: the 
’80s. 
 In order to stop the spread 
of AIDS, then a mysterious 
epidemic 
disproportionally 
affecting gay men, the federal 
government enacted a lifetime 
ban on drawing blood from 
men who have had sex with 
men, also known as MSM. 
Intended 
as 
a 
temporary 
policy, it became a permanent 
rule as the AIDS epidemic 
continued to rage on through 
the ’90s, killing hundreds of 
thousands. By 2015, the U.S. 
replaced its lifetime ban with 
a ban on men who had been 
sexually active with other men 
in the past 12 months. While it 
seems like a giant leap in the 

right direction (12 months is 
a lot shorter than a lifetime), 
it 
barely 
increased 
the 
number of eligible donors 
and amounted to a lifetime 
ban 
for 
most 
gay 
men. 
After the Pulse Nightclub 
shooting in 2016, Orlando’s 
LGBTQ community rushed 
to donate blood for their 
friends and family only to 
find themselves barred from 
doing so. They protested the 
ban and pushed the Food 
and Drug Administration to 
review it, but as the article 
states, the FDA ultimately 
decided to keep it in place 
after deciding there “wasn’t 
enough evidence supporting 
the 
change.” 
While 
proponents of the ban tout 
it as necessary for public 
health, it is an archaic rule 
that harms more than helps. 
With 
mandatory 
HIV 
screening for all donated 
blood, modern technology 
has made the odds of a 
contaminated donation going 
undetected 
astronomically 
small. A blood transfusion is 
needed every two seconds in 
the United States, and with 
only 38 percent of Americans 
eligible to donate under the 
current ban, and other rules, 
blood shortages have become 
a frequent issue. Lifting the 
ban would alleviate this issue 
and increase the donor pool 
by about 130,000, potentially 
saving up to 390,000 lives 
every year. 
As nations like Russia use 
bans like ours to further 
discriminate 
against 
their 
LGBTQ 
communities, 
the 
concept of limiting blood 
donations from MSM has 
become less of a public health 
issue and more of a civil 
rights 
one. 
By 
needlessly 
“otherizing” gay and bisexual 
men, the United States is 
continuing its tradition of 
making HIV a point on which 
to stigmatize our community 
and perpetuate dangerous 
stereotypes. It is time for 
science to drive the policy 
behind this issue, not only 
saving 
lives, 
but 
saving 
students like me needless 
shame 
and 
humiliation. 
Like mullets and Long Duk 
Dong, the government’s gay 
blood ban belongs in the 
’80s.

T

he 
power 
of 
storytelling 
needs 
no 
introduction. 
Stories 
are 
the 
intergenerational 
links 
that 
keep 
culture 
alive 
and 
transcend 
our 
existences 
beyond 
the 
biological 
reactions 
that 
hold 
us 
together. 
Stories 
make 
us 
multidimensional 
creatures — human 
in the truest sense.
They 
also 
allow 
us 
to 
transmit 
information 
that 
cannot 
be 
communicated 
through charts or graphs. 
We’ve used stories to shape 
and 
build 
perspectives, 
assemble and dismantle beliefs 
and influence and control 
behaviors over the course of 
history. But what happens 
when stories (plural) become 
story (singular), and a host 
of intersectional narratives 
and stories are reduced to 
one facet of an individual’s 
identity? While the power of 
storytelling can be explained 
by 
basic 
neuroscience, 
its 
tremendous effects on our 
perception and understanding 
of the world are the result of 
sociology. But both of these 
elements provide insight as 
to why propagating a single 
narrative 
is 
dangerous, 
specifically with regard to 
today’s sociopolitical climate. 
Storytelling 
is 
powerful 
because it incites emotion 
and 
empathy. 
Words 
— 
when presented as facts or 
information — are processed 
by regions in the temporal 
lobe 
called 
Broca’s 
area 
and Wernicke’s area. Here, 
words are simply decoded 
into their meaning. When 
strung with emotions and 
distinct 
imagery 
however, 
the brain behaves completely 
differently. Then, the sensory 
cortex is activated. As a result, 
multiple regions of the brain 
are 
utilized 
in 
processing 
a story. Word choice and 
rhetoric can all influence the 
extent to which information 
is processed in our brains, 
making it more important 
to 
deliver 
comprehensive, 
multidimensional stories that 
are representative of people, 
and not just the idea of them. 

The power of storytelling lies 
in the fact that narratives 
capture our hearts by first 
attracting 
our 
brains. 
As 
they 
continue 
to 
be 
processed 
in 
multiple 
cortexes, 
they stick with us 
forever.
The 
pitfalls 
of 
this 
phenomenon 
emerge 
when 
we 
misuse 
it. 
While 
some 
may 
know 
that these stories 
are fake or misrepresentative, 
our subconscious may believe 
them to be real, which in turn 
influences how we perceive 
and behave. 

As 
celebrated 
author 
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie 
artfully describes, “The single 
story creates stereotypes, and 
the problem with stereotypes 
is not that they are untrue, but 
that they are incomplete. They 
make one story become the 
only story.” Each individual 
life contains a heterogeneous 
mix of stories. If people are 
reduced to one, they are 
stripped of their humanity.
Though 
this 
point 
was 
made nearly 10 years ago, 
the notion of perpetuating 
a single story is relevant 
amid the current political 
climate, specifically with the 
platforms of President Donald 
Trump 
and 
Sen. 
Bernie 
Sanders, 
I-Vt. 
Both 
have 
systematically 
reduced 
the 
complexities of the American 
political landscape by either 
fixating on the perils of the 
“other” or on the tyranny of 
the banks. Both candidates 
have essentially disregarded 
storylines that complicate the 
core stance they are assuming 
and contribute to a larger 
political issue linked with 
civility. 
Polarization 
limits 

our ability to understand how 
multiple 
narratives 
about 
issues from immigration to 
universal health care may be 
simultaneously true. 
The 
value 
of 
multiple 
narratives 
is 
that 
the 
stories begin to form an 
interconnected 
web 
and 
offer 
dimensionality 
to 
complicated 
issues. 
They 
allow us to see a larger 
picture, one that is beyond 
any individual discourse or 
opinion. 
Civility 
requires 
individuals to take each other 
and the narratives they bear 
seriously, to be perceived as 
fully realized global citizens 
with identities, needs and 
beliefs that deserve to be 
accommodated. Stories come 
with an immense neurological 
power, one unlike any other 
method 
of 
communicating 
information. 
As 
a 
result, 
those with the privilege of 
presenting 
other 
peoples’ 
stories are morally bound to 
do so representatively. 
When 
narratives 
are 
solidified as the ubiquitous 
norms, or policies of society, 
there is a cascade of effects 
unleashed in the form of bias, 
prejudice and discrimination, 
which becomes exceedingly 
difficult to overcome. While 
individuals 
can 
renounce 
their prejudices, they are 
inevitably vulnerable to the 
habits of the mind. Intentions 
are 
not 
impact, 
and 
ultimately, what is neurally 
engrained is achieved. One-
dimensional stories are often 
rooted in biases, and when 
consistent, they help shape 
prejudiced mindsets. When 
these are the only narratives 
that 
are 
represented 
systemically, 
they 
become 
acts of discrimination that 
are passed down to further 
generations. 
The molecular mechanism 
of storytelling demonstrates 
just how powerful stories can 
be. It is a uniquely human 
ability that we have, and 
when given the opportunity 
to 
represent 
stories 
systemically, it is important 
to make sure that we are 
encompassing of a variety of 
different dimensions.

HELP WANTED

GO BLUE

There’s something really magical about being a 
different person for a day. Whether it’s just you but 
fancier or a complete disguise, dressing up in any 
way is generally a hoot, no matter the time of the 
year. Of course, with Halloween this week, I’ve been 
thinking about this quite a lot. What should I dress 
up as? What incredible costume could I take pictures 
of and post on Instagram, proving my loyalty to the 
holiday beyond simple recognition? Halloween has 
always been my favorite day of the year — I love 
spooky things, jack-o-lanterns and I probably have 
a medical-grade addiction to sugar that at this point 
in my life is no longer cute. But I realize, now, that 
the reason Halloween is so important to me is that 
it offers an excuse to break out of the conventions of 
everyday life, without anyone really caring. For one 
day of the year, you can be anything or anyone. It’s a 
day that’s full of potential and fun, and you don’t have 
to be a child to appreciate that. 
In fact, I don’t think I really started to appreciate 
Halloween until I got a little bit older than its target 
demographic. I remember my mom helping me to 
hand-make my costumes as a child, with feather 
boas and bears and different slices of fabric strewn 
across our house for weeks before the special day. 
The costumes she made for me were handed down 
to my siblings as they grew, and then to our younger 
cousins. Halloween was always a family affair for us. 
But the joy of putting on my own costume that I had 
come up with myself and even bled on a little bit while 
I tried to sew it by hand was like something I had 
never experienced before. Somewhere in the middle 
school haze of adolescence, I was finally able to be 
what I really wanted to be, to dress up like a princess 
or Mother Earth or an ill-prepared bumblebee with 
a broken wing. I had an excuse to wear the makeup 
I wanted to, to dress like an adult when I was really 

just a thirteen-year-old with dreams too big for 
her britches. Nonetheless, my love of Halloween 
developed as I grew up, instead of fading like I 
imagine most childrens’ do. 
The thing is, as much as I love Halloween, the 
holiday excitement of looking how you dreamed you 
would is easily translatable into everyday life. Sure, I 
really go all out on October 31st, but I also dress the 
way that I want to for the rest of the year, now. I wear 
at least business casual on any given day. I really like 
dresses, doing my hair, makeup, looking nice and 
wearing nice things that I have picked out for myself. 
It took me until almost high school, but I realized 
then that you didn’t have to wait until one day of the 
year to accept yourself as you wanted to look, not as 
the world wanted you to. For so long, I only dressed 
up when I had implied permission from others as to 
not draw suspicion or judgy glances when I came to 
class in heels and an elaborate braided hairdo. But 
what’s the point of saving all that energy for a certain 
time of year when you can integrate that joy into the 
mundanity of daily life? 
I challenge you to try the same thing — to bring one 
part of Halloween or a costume or even something 
you wore for a special event into your normal day. 
What I found with dressing up, and still continue to 
feel today, is that everything seems brighter when 
you’re happy with how you look. It might be a little bit 
uncomfortable and take a little longer in the morning, 
but the confidence and strength that comes with 
feeling happy in your own skin is worth it by far. This 
doesn’t just apply to clothes, or even anything I’ve 
suggested. It can start with small things, with that 
nice hairclip you like, or a perfect shade of lipstick, 
your favorite shoes that you’re worried you’ll ruin if 
you wear them too much. There isn’t only one day to 
pull out the stops from your look and make yourself 
truly happy on more levels than just the aesthetic. 
The spirit of Halloween (no pun intended) is not 
meant to stay within 24 hours of the year — it can last 
as long as you want it to.

Clara Scott: Playing the
game of lifelong dress up

A combination of “America’s Funniest Home 
Videos” and game show prize money is how 
I would describe TBS’s “The Misery Index.” 
There isn’t necessarily anything wrong with 
this format, aside from the overall lack of 
“game” in the game show. “The Misery Index” 
boasts a talented cast from top to bottom: It’s 
hosted by the always entertaining Jameela 
Jamil, star of NBC’s “The Good Place,” and 
supplemented by James Murray, Brian Quinn, 
Sal Vulcano and 
Joe 
Gatto, 
better known as 
members of the 
hilarious 
cast 
of “Impractical 
Jokers” or, The 
Tenderloins. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
clear 
chemistry 
between 
the 
cast can only do 
so much for the 
weak 
concept 
of 
the 
actual 
game.
The show’s creator, Andy Breckman, based 
the program around the card game “Shit 
Happens.” Two contestants compete head-to-
head for the chance to win money by correctly 
identifying how miserable an incident is. Each 
event, from being breastfed until the age of 
nine to falling 30 flights down an elevator shaft 
and surviving, is rated by psychologists on a 
scale of one to 100 — the higher the number, 
the more painful and traumatic the experience. 
The contestants must guess the number of 
each experience, and the prize money goes to 

the player with the closest guess. The stars 
of “Impractical Jokers,” whose only purpose 
appears to be adding some entertainment to an 
otherwise non-skillful game show, are divided 
between the teams. The contestant that out-
guesses their opponent moves to the final 
round with a shot at the grand prize of $30,000.
Relishing in the pain of others has always 
been popular entertainment on television, 
but the game itself is dull. The questions lack 
variety and are nearly identical to one another. 
I would have stopped watching after the first 
commercial break had I not been obligated to 
see the program through.
Not all is lost, 
however, as the 
unlikely 
pairing 
of 
Jamil 
and 
the 
Tenderloins 
supplements what 
would otherwise 
be 
a 
failed 
experiment. 
It 
was the standout 
performances 
of 
these individuals, 
not the questions, 
that triggered the 
most 
laughter. 
Jamil’s 
capacity 
to remain relevant when she could have easily 
been overpowered by four standout comedians 
speaks to her own talent.
If you are a fan of game shows, this is not for 
you. I would recommend sticking to “Ellen’s 
Game of Games” if you would like to see real 
comedic misery. If you like “Impractical 
Jokers,” give this a shot — the show features 
the same outrageous and cumbersome comedy. 
Personally, I will not be spending next Tuesday 
night watching “The Misery Index,” but if I 
ever am feeling bad about myself, this program 
will surely put things in perspective.

TV REVIEW

I don’t know how to explain his return other than to 
start where I found him: I discovered Frank Ocean while 
watching the VMAs when I was 13. He crooned “Thinkin 
Bout You” seated on a rock on a stage that was dark save 
for the light of a faux campfire — a tame departure for the 
VMAs. I had no idea who he was, but his music was unlike 
anything I’d heard before, his airy neo soul unfamiliar to 
my tween pop taste. I read his infamous open letter on 
tumblr, though I didn’t understand his love language yet. 
I’d desperately like to say this was the moment I became a 
fan, but I didn’t know who I was at thirteen years old.
I needed Frank Ocean when I was 17 and still had no 
idea who I was. Blonde approached me my senior year 
of high school as my interiority strained between what I 
wanted of myself and what other people wanted of me. 
I waded in a normalcy that perceptions of my Arabness 
permitted. My shyness was a membrane between who 
I knew myself to be and a community where everyone 
looked like me. Normalcy, as I 
knew it, was the strangeness 
I felt around other people. 
It was the way time passed 
like water through fingers 
around the boys and girls 
who would never feel, never 
know what I felt towards 
them. The words, “Maybe 
I’m a fool / maybe I should move / and settle, two kids 
with a swimming pool / I’m not brave,” radiated through 
my headphones in the hallways. Blonde compacted the 
inumerable situations and feelings that deviate from 
normalcy into an album that eschews such a concept, its 
ambiguity and duality part and parcel to the very sound it 
embodies. 
Blonde, stylized “blond” on the cover, blurs 
differentiations of gender and sexuality into an ether of 
feeling, an internalized understanding of self through 
external love and reflection. It defines an era, its contents 
carefully curated around an amalgamation of emotions 
felt in that four year gap between Blonde and Channel 
Orange. For a public that wanted more following his 
popularity in 2012, Frank only found it appropriate to 
experience different things and create different music. 
Such a departure from the spotlight would leave most 
artists forgotten and anticipation for new work dead. The 
opposite played and still plays true for Frank. His enigma 
breeds anticipation. Every track he drops is a landmark 
moment of force that needs reckoning. The year following 
Blonde’s release unfolded over Blonded Radio, and Frank 
singles dropped sporadically, unannounced but widely 

circulated. The singles abandoned the sound of Blonde but 
tugged at the same ideas, most notably “Chanel” in which 
Ocean croons “My guy pretty like a girl / And he got fight 
stories to tell / I see both sides like Chanel.” 
Frank released “DHL” two years following the release 
of “Provider” on Blonded Radio and over three years since 
the debut of Blonde, almost the same span of time it took for 
him to follow up Channel Orange. 
And “DHL”’s time and space only leaves Frank fans 
eager for more. From the get-go, the song is a significant 
departure from previous work. Whereas “Ivy” radiates 
a contemplative aura, “DHL” is about the present. It 
balances itself on warped, misshapen synths that chug 
and mesh into one another under woozy mumble raps. 
Former tracks and singles carried themselves on sparse, 
breezy instrumentals with every note clear and apparent, 
every lyric bare and vulnerable. “DHL” is not one of these 
songs. Beyond its sonic aesthetics, it presents Frank in a 
braggadocious mood. He doesn’t croon; he raps, and he 
raps about “diamonds,” “Starbucks” and being “rich as 
fuck” as he’s “sellin’ records out the truck.” He no longer 
feels like his lover “see(s) me 
like a UFO,” and he wants 
the world to know that he’s 
“Got my partner in the front, 
been my BF for a month/ But 
we been fuckin’ from the 
jump.”
The flows themselves are 
a bit woozy, almost fumbling 
over each other as narratives of sex and money weave 
a story together. It never feels contrived though, and 
never messy or unfocused. It plays out almost like a set of 
mantras “I got a pack, came from the DHL / Just caught up 
with a pack” loops over and over again at the end. Rather 
than pinpointing these moments individually, they gather 
together, layered to create a complex sound and energy. 
Every piece comes together to usher in a new Frank 
era that marks the end of Blonde. Debuting with the 
return of Blonded Radio after his “PrEP+” club night 
and two previews for new vinyl tracks, the single pushes 
a new age of Frank’s music. Whereas Blonde is strong 
in its vulnerability, “DHL” exists in a period in which 
Frank expresses a need for artists to decide on their own 
whether to be strong and vulnerable. The sparseness 
and painstaking detail of Blonde is dissolved into beats 
that better suit Frank’s current appreciation for the club 
scene. For an artist defined by the impact and meaning of 
his music, this is monumental, signifying not only a new 
sound but a new reach. As someone who has grown both 
from and through Blonde throughout college, I’m eager to 
see how the next project will define a new generation for 
longtime fans and brand new ones.

How do you build a Division I athlete? Just ask the novice rowing team

What makes a Division I 
athlete? 
Enthusiasm for improvement, 
a mindset for work, physiology 
— one thing is noticeably absent 
from Dan Harrison’s list: any 
skill in the sport. 
This year, the majority of the 36 
novice rowers on the Wolverines’ 
team have no experience with an 
oar. While this isn’t unheard of 
for collegiate rowing, Harrison, 
Michigan’s 
novice 
rowing 
coach, has led a 
concerted 
effort 
over the past few 
years to recruit 
inexperienced 
athletes 
from 
across the state.
Harrison 
and 
his coaching staff 
travel throughout 
Michigan, 
going 
to 
high 
school 
tournaments and 
practices in every sport, looking 
for their next championship boat. 
Getting the word out through 
coaches and even the current 
Michigan rowers, Harrison finds 
driven high school high school 
athletes and encourages them to 
check out the team. 
The theory behind the strategy 
is that Michigan is looking at 
a pool of untapped potential — 
future DI rowers who’ve never 
gotten the opportunity to get on 
the water.
“I think the reason it’s such a 
big walk-on opportunity is that 
it’s not a sport you can just pick 
up as a little kid,” said assistant 
coach Liz Tuppen. “You can’t 
just walk outside your house 
and go play. It’s not offered in 
all communities and so that’s 
why it’s an opportunity later 
at a place like Michigan where 
athletics is so prominent and 
well supported.”
The sport does come with a 
hefty price tag. A competitive 
boat alone can cost anywhere 
from 
$25,000 
to 
$50,000 
— a cost most high school 
athletic 
programs 
can’t 
swing, particularly in lower 
socioeconomic areas. There are 

just 18 high school programs 
across 
the 
state, 
leading 
Harrison to look elsewhere for 
new talent. 
Even if kids do have access to 
a program, very few start rowing 
before 
their 
freshman 
year 
because of how physically taxing 
it can be. For those not starting 
until college, it’s easy to make up 
the ground. 
“I think within the state, there 
are a lot of athletes who have 
that physiology and just haven’t 
found their sport yet,” Harrison 
said. “They might be playing 
basketball, 
but 
just 
have 
too 
much 
slow-twitch. 
They 
might 
be 
running 
cross 
country, 
but they’re six 
feet tall. They 
should probably 
be rowers.” 
Six-foot-
one 
freshman 
Olivia McMullen fit the bill 
perfectly. A former three-sport 
athlete, McMullen heard about 
the opportunity from her high 
school volleyball coach. She 
knew she wasn’t going to get the 
option to continue with either of 
her first loves — volleyball and 
basketball — collegiately, but 
she didn’t want to give up hope 
of being a Division-I athlete. 
She already had the height and 
athleticism, and after talking to 
Harrison, she decided to give 
rowing a try. 
“I 
love 
that 
you 
have 
individual 
goals 
and 
you’re 
trying to get faster individually, 
but it’s so much of a team sport 
too,” McMullen said. “It’s just 
a cool sport and I just couldn’t 
wait to try it out.”
But, it takes much more than 
the right physique to do well on 
Michigan’s team. As physically 
demanding as rowing is, it may 
be more a test of determination 
than strength. Repeating the 
same motion over and over, 
perfectly in sync with the other 
seven athletes in your boat, 
takes willpower, teamwork and 
a strong competitive drive — all 
things McMullen learned from 

her previous team experiences. 
When she made the decision to 
try collegiate rowing, McMullen 
spent the rest of her senior year 
building up her fitness using a 
training plan Harrison gave her. 
Counterintuitively, he advised 
her against one thing: joining 
her high school’s 
rowing team. 
“We want them 
to be a part of their 
(original) teams,” 
Harrison said. “I 
think a big part of 
it is it’s important 
to 
be 
part 
of 
your community, 
be part of the 
program 
that 
you 
were 
with. 
To abruptly switch away from 
your team, I don’t think is a 
great practice and we preach 
team here, so it would be 
pretty hypocritical for us to 
say, ‘We want you to abandon 
the teammates you’ve had for 
the last three years for this one 

pursuit,’.”
Beyond that aspect, there’s an 
argument to be made about form. 
Harrison doesn’t want to his 
future rowers developing poor 
technique before coming to Ann 
Arbor. Rowing is an extremely 
technically refined, repetitive 
sport 
— 
once 
bad habits are 
learned, they’re 
hard to break. 
When Harrison 
meets his team 
at the first day 
of practice, he 
wants 
to 
be 
working with a 
clean slate. 
In fact, the 
new 
novices 
don’t even touch an oar on the 
first day. Instead, they do a two-
mile run and circuit workout. 
While Harrison is looking to see 
who stands out, he knows a team 
isn’t built in a day. 
“When it does get challenging, 
that is when you see the true 

character of someone,” Harrison 
said. “When the fatigue builds 
up, when we’re doing lots of 
volume, it’s dark out, that’s when 
you see the true character of the 
rowers come out.”
Understandably, not all the 
novices make it through. As 
winter season gets into full 
gear with demanding indoor 
workouts, at least a few novices 
each year decide rowing isn’t 
for them. In Harrison’s mind, 
one thing differentiates the ones 
who stay from those who don’t: 
an enthusiasm, almost love, for 
hard work. 
“There’s definitely a level of 
motivation and adherence to the 
idea of excellence (at Michigan),” 
Harrison said. “When you want 
to set that standard, they’re 
really excited about it and it’s not 
intimidating. Being a Michigan 
student athlete is a big deal. The 
expectation is high and you don’t 
have to sell that. It’s just known. 
So, when people join, they 
understand what they’re getting 

into.”
For those who stick it out, 
the rewards are worth the 
work. Last year’s top novice 
eight came in first at the Big 
Ten Championships and some 
members of that boat are already 
starting to make a name for 
themselves on the varsity team. 
Sophomore Elizabeth Schlyer 
rowed in the second varsity eight 
at the largest race of the season, 
the Head of the Charles. 
Harrison has seen many of 
his former novice athletes climb 
the ranks of the varsity team, 
starting in one of the lower 
boats and working their way 
up to the top eights, becoming 
team leaders and even reaching 
All-American status. While this 
may seem daunting to someone 
joining the team, novices like 
McMullen aren’t scared off by 
the challenge. 
“With 
rowing,” 
McMullen 
said, “what you put in is what you 
get into it is what you’ll get out.” 
And McMullen is all in.

The Michigan rowing team recruits athletes who haven’t rowed for its novice team as a way of getting around socioeconomic barriers to entering the sport.

(Rowing is) not 
a sport you can 
just pick up as a 
little kid.

With rowing, 
what you put in 
is what you get 
out.

Michigan looking forward to season

On April 9 of last year, Jordan 
Poole, 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis 
and 
Charles Matthews all decided 
to forgo their remaining college 
eligibility and declare for the NBA 
Draft. From that moment on, the 
Michigan 
basketball 
program 
was launched into an offseason of 
uncertainty and overhaul.
John Beilein jumped to the 
professional ranks. Nine days 
later, Fab Five member Juwan 
Howard returned to Ann Arbor as 
the Wolverines’ head coach. From 
there, assistant coaches Luke 
Yaklich and DeAndre Haynes 
moved on, while Phil Martelli and 
Howard Eisley moved in. On July 
6, Franz Wagner committed to 
Michigan — giving a needed boost 
on the wing. And finally, just two 
weeks ago, Howard landed his first 
five-star recruit, 2020 forward 
Isaiah Todd. 
On Friday night, the Wolverines 
will finally play a basketball game. 
Granted, that game is an 
exhibition against Saginaw Valley 
State. But, with all that’s taken 
place since its Sweet Sixteen loss to 
Texas Tech last March, Michigan 
is ready to tip-off. 
“We’re really excited,” said 

sophomore guard David DeJulius. 
“There was a lot of talk around us, 
having a new coaching staff but 
we were just kinda mature about 
it. We just stayed down, stayed 
humble and worked hard.” 
Even freshman guard Cole 
Bajema, who stayed committed 
to the program throughout the 
coaching search, is itching to 
get his first taste of gametime at 
Crisler Center. 
“I’m definitely a little nervous,” 
Bajema said. “I feel like that’s 
normal for a first-year player 
though. Overall, I’m super excited. 
I’ve been practicing since I got 
here in June, so it’s been a while. 
I’m ready to get out there.”
With the exception of a sparsely-
attended open scrimmage last 
Thursday, the matchup against 
the Cardinals will be the first time 
fans get a glimpse of the new-
look Wolverines under Howard. 
Without as many pure scorers as 
a season ago, they should expect a 
Michigan squad heavily dependent 
on defensive intensity, especially in 
the early going. 
“Our identity is going to be 
extremely competitive,” Howard 
said. “We’re going to play hard-
nosed 
basketball, 
where 
we 
defend… Our defense has picked up 
strong in practice but offensively, 

we still have a lot of work to do and 
some things to clean up.”
It will likely take some time 
for the Wolverines to sort out the 
offensive kinks with Howard’s 
new system. Losing Wagner, who’s 
been praised for his offensive skill-
set, to a broken hand before the 
season even starts, doesn’t help 
that cause. 
How smoothly that offensive 
transition goes though is not a 
question that will be answered 
tomorrow night. Michigan will 
undoubtedly put up a lopsided 
number against a team that 
finished 6-14 last season in the 
Great Lakes Valley Conference. 
Still, Howard can at least glean 
some details from his team’s 
performance. 
“We’re going to treat it as a 
regular season game,” Howard 
said. “I’m not looking at it as a game 
that doesn’t count. We’re going to 
compete like we’re playing against 
the number-one ranked team in 
college basketball.”
For a team loaded with new 
faces and revised expectations, 
any game is an opportunity to 
prove themselves. 
“Am I going to have some 
butterflies? Of course I will,” 
Howard said. “But I am going to be 
pumped.”

York bringing stability after injury

Cam York wasn’t happy.
He sat in the press box, five 
floors above the ice, watching his 
team warm up below him to finish 
the series against Lake Superior 
State.
A week and a day earlier, 
against Clarkson, the freshman 
defenseman played 27 minutes 
in his Michigan debut. But he 
suffered an ankle injury in that 
game, and he missed the next game 
— and the two that followed.
So, on Oct. 19, York’s face said 
it all as he sat with the rest of 
Michigan’s 
non-dressers. 
He 
wanted to be down with his team, 
and 
the 
disappointment 
was 
evident.
In York’s two years at the U.S. 
National 
Team 
Development 
Program, he played in 122 games 
and never missed more than two 
games in a row. In the first month 
of his career with the Wolverines, 
York missed three games straight.
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
knew that York had never suffered 
an injury of this type before — the 
kind where your pain tolerance 
and confidence dictate whether 
you can or can’t play. Finding the 
balance between healing and 
pushing to get back in the lineup 
is tricky for anyone, and it was 
especially tricky for the 18-year-old 
freshman dealing with it for the 
first time.
“I think any time you have your 

first injury of any sort and you’ve 
never missed games before, you 
just don’t know how to handle it 
and the pain tolerance,” Pearson 
said Wednesday. “Because I’m 
having some soreness, should I 
play, should I not play? Obviously, 
he had a lot of people tell him a lot 
of different things, but he’s the only 
guy who can tell how he felt.”
Once York was cleared to get 
back on the ice, it wasn’t a smooth 
path to returning to the lineup, 
either.
“It was a lengthy process,” York 
said. “It was only two weeks, but it 
felt like a year. … Mentally, it sucks 
just because you want to be out 
there with your brothers battling 
and you’re stuck watching. That 
was tough.”
The week leading into the Lake 
Superior State series, York skated 
once on his own and practiced 
partially with the team before 
deciding he wasn’t fully ready to 
be back. It took another week for 
him to test things again — this time 
on the Wednesday before Western 
Michigan came to town last Friday.
Two practices later and two full 
weeks after the injury, York’s name 
was called as one of Michigan’s 
starters against the Broncos on 
Oct. 25. By the end of the night, 
York had picked up his first — and 
second — collegiate points with 
two assists and had a plus-3 rating 
in the Wolverines’ 4-0 win.
“Great, excellent, just so smart, 
so smooth and so easy,” Pearson 
said after the game. “He got 

through the game pretty good, 
we’ll see how he feels, we’ll see if 
he can go back to back, but it’s hard. 
You haven’t played many games 
and you have to come off an injury. 
I thought he was a warrior and he 
did a great job.”
The following night, when 
Michigan went to Kalamazoo to 
face Western Michigan on the 
road, York remained in the starting 
lineup. Pearson had been unsure 
how he’d do in back-to-back games, 
but as the game began, it was clear 
that the concern for York wasn’t his 
physical readiness to play.
The road crowd rattled the 
freshman early, and it took him 
most of the first period to settle 
in. But by the time the Wolverines 
were on the power play in the 
second period, York was back to his 
usual self and picked up his third 
point of the year — a secondary 
assist on senior forward Will 
Lockwood’s power-play goal.
“They had some interesting 
chants that were coming at me, but 
it was fun,” York said. “Every time 
you get to go into another Michigan 
school’s barn, it’s always special.”
York still isn’t 100 percent, but 
he got a full week of practice this 
week in preparation for his second 
road trip — this time to No. 13 
Ohio State. The atmosphere at the 
Schottenstein Center is unlikely 
to replicate Lawson Ice Arena, 
but starting a road swing with a 
volatile crowd in Kalamazoo isn’t 
a bad thing as it set a high bar 
for what young players like York 
should expect on the road.
As Michigan tries to get its first 
road sweep since Jan. 2018 this 
weekend, the stability York brings 
will be key for the Wolverines.
“He just adds so much, just as 
far as breakouts,” Pearson said 
Wednesday. “He’s so smooth, he 
makes a great first pass, so he’s 
going to take a lot of pressure off of 
us in our own zone and then on the 
power play, he’s the quarterback.
“He is the quarterback of the 
power play and he just settles 
everything down. To have him 
available is — can’t put a price on it. 
It’s huge.”

8 — Friday, November 1, 2019
Sports
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

T

he thoughts are scat-
tered. Let’s get right 
to it.
1. I’m not sure I’d rush to 
anoint Hassan Haskins the bell-
cow back just 
yet. Haskins’ 
20-carry, 
148-yard 
performance 
against 
Notre Dame 
was revela-
tory — it was 
the highest 
rushing total 
by a Michi-
gan back 
since Karan Higdon tallied 
156 yards 419 days ago. But 
Zach Charbonnet continues 
to quietly pace himself as the 
second-best freshman running 
back in school history. Tru 
Wilson’s pass-protection (and 
rush prowess!) make getting 
a handful of snaps absolutely 
worthwhile. Not to mention, 
save a Higdon-esque back in a 
Higdon-esque 2018 situation, 
Jim Harbaugh tends to shy 
away from workhorse backs. 
An aside: It’s unfathomable to 
me that this staff ever thought 
Haskins should be a linebacker.
2. This would seem an 
opportune week to get Dylan 
McCaffery and/or Joe Milton 
some quality time. Everything 
now should be 
viewed through 
the lens of gear-
ing up for Ohio 
State. There 
is no world 
in which the 
Wolverines are 
best positioned 
to compete 
against the 
Buckeyes if 
Shea Patterson 
is, in any way, ailing. Not to 
mention, the McCaffery/Milton 
battle will be “a thing” quite 
soon — might as well have some 

real-game, semi-meaningful 
snaps to harken back to.
Speaking of hiding in a shell 
until Ohio State …
3. It’s not hard to imagine 
Michigan’s offense dialing up 
a relatively vanilla gameplan. 
This rushing attack seems to 
be real, and not rooted in much 
deception. If the Wolverines 
have anything up their sleeves, 
they surely won’t pull it out in 
College Park against a reeling 
Maryland team. There are more 
important games coming soon. 
Run the ball 45 times. Control 
the clock. Win by a few touch-
downs. Get out healthy.
4. Snap counts are not pub-
licly available, but Dax Hill 
should continue to see them 
rise. You aren’t beating Ohio 
State unless you match — or 
at least mitigate — its speed. 
It’s no secret Hill will be an 
asset in doing so. Cornerbacks 
coach Mike Zordich practically 
foamed at the mouth this week 
when asked whether Hill could 
play corner for him. It’s time 
to gradually turn the keys over 
to the kids. Keeping with that 
metaphor, Hill is the Golden 
Child.
5. Zordich also said this 
week he saw a real team hiding 
under … whatever’s going on 
in Maryland. “I think they’re 
scary, because I think there’s a 
lot of talent there. 
I watched the 
Howard game, 
just got done 
watching the 
Syracuse game, 
they’ve just miss-
ing a click some-
where,” he said. 
“…Underneath 
whatever hap-
pened to them, 
there’s a good 
football team underneath that. 
We just have to come out of the 
locker room swinging and get 
ready to play a good game.”

Is he being diplomatic? Abso-
lutely. Do I believe him? Not 
entirely. Is there at least a pos-
sibility this staff is a hint more 
concerned than the general 
public about going on the road 
and playing a team with noth-
ing to lose? Yes.
To that point 
...
6. Quarter-
back Tyrell 
Pigrome 
appears likely 
to play Satur-
day. Ann Arbor 
native Josh 
Jackson will 
also certainly 
have some 
added incentive 
to play well. Neither of them 
should stoke fear in a Michigan 
defense that has held Ian Book 
to 2.9 yards per attempt. But, 

again, weirder things have hap-
pened.
7. Ronnie Bell’s injury has 
been kept mysteriously under 
the radar this week. Harbaugh 
did not entertain an update 
Monday. The media (yes, fin-
gers pointed inward) have 
offered little 
interest. Call me 
crazy, but I think 
losing your lead-
ing receiver — in 
both catches and 
yards — during 
the stretch run of 
the season should 
cause some con-
cern. Perhaps Bell 
will suit up Satur-
day and none of it 
will matter. Regardless, that’s a 
concerning development worth 
monitoring.
8. Is Josh Ross healthy? 

Do we have an answer as to 
whether he will re-assume 
a major role? Can he possi-
bly play with Cam McGrone? 
Is this all weirdly quiet? It’s 
relatively clear that McGrone 
just Wally Pipp’d his elder at 
the MIKE linebacker spot, but 
Ross is not the 
kind of player 
worth deliber-
ately alienating. 
Finding a way 
to get both on 
the field seems 
feasible, and 
Don Brown has 
never shied 
away from too 
much speed or 
physicality.
I think those thoughts are 
scattered enough for today. 
Should the Wolverines take care 
of business on the eastern sea-

board this weekend (stunningly 
inconsiderate to traveling stu-
dent newspapers to add a team 
to the Big Ten that geographi-
cally does not belong, but I 
digress), we’ll all be gearing up 
for an emotion-filled Michigan-
Michigan State game soon. The 
Spartans appear 
on the verge of 
catastrophe, but, 
as we all know, 
that all goes out 
the window when 
Mark Dantonio 
gets his annual 
shot at Harbaugh. 
First, though, 
a leisurely trek 
down to College 
Park.

The Michigan football team beat Notre Dame last week and is expected to win easily on Saturday when it goes to College Park to play a reeling 3-5 Maryland

The 
McCaffery/
Milton battle 
will be A Thing.

times. Control 
the clock. Win 
by a few (TDs).

Can (Josh

What to watch for: No. 14 Michigan at Maryland 

For Michigan football, the 
next three weeks should serve 
as a steady march to the one 
that really matters — No. 3 Ohio 
State’s visit to Ann Arbor on 
November 30.
Until then, it’s a simple 
matter of proving that the 
Wolverines’ last six quarters 
— in which they’ve outscored 
a pair of top-10 opponents, 
59-21 — are no mirage and that 
maybe, somehow, this is the 
year Michigan can finally take 
down the vaunted Buckeyes. 
Against Michigan State and a 
quietly 6-2 Indiana, that will be 
a challenge. Both teams, despite 
their 
flaws, 
carry 
enough 
weaponry 
to 
challenge 
the 
Wolverines’ presumed growth, 
even in losses.
Against 
Maryland, 
there 
should be no such troubles. Once 
the surprise of early September 
behind 
an 
unexpectedly 
explosive offense, the Terrapins 
have lost five of their last 
six 
games, 
their 
starting 
quarterback and any positivity 
this season once carried.
But 
in 
Michigan’s 
three 
road 
games 
this 
season, 
reality 
has 
rarely 
matched 
lofty expectations. Even as a 
20-point favorite at Illinois 
three weeks ago, the Wolverines 
nearly squandered a 28-point 
second-quarter 
lead, 
leaving 
Champaign with more questions 
than answers.
As Michigan looks to avoid 
doing the same in College Park 
on Saturday, The Daily breaks 
down what to watch for:
Michigan’s 
offensive 
balance
All offseason, the promise for 
Michigan’s offense was “speed 
in space.”
The Wolverines’ pound-it-
down-your-throat, 
pro-style 
offense from Jim Harbaugh’s 
first four years was dismissed as 
the antiquated style of football 
that could win you 10 games, but 
carried a capped ceiling. With 
Shea Patterson under center 
and a trio of supremely talented 
junior receivers catching the 
ball, the personnel was perfect 

to install a spread offense and 
offensive 
coordinator 
Josh 
Gattis, 
newly 
arrived 
from 
Alabama, was just the man to 
carry it out.
So, naturally, Michigan’s run/
pass split in last week’s 45-14 
win over Notre Dame — easily 
its most impressive performance 
of the season — was 14 pass 
attempts, 
57 
carries. 
That 
game, of course, carried the 
caveat of starting in a torrential 
downpour and finishing with 
the Wolverines running out the 
clock on a shocking blowout.
The 
trend, 
though, 
has 
footing in the beginning of 
Michigan’s recent turnaround. 
After attempting 12 passes and 
six carries in the first quarter 
against Penn State two weeks 
ago, the Wolverines ran more 
times than they passed in 
the second half, even as they 
attempted to climb out of a 21-0 
hole.
Against Maryland, the final 
split will likely match last 

week’s 
imbalance 
regardless 
of gameplan, thanks to game 
script. But in the first quarter, 
before the game devolves into a 
blowout, watch for Michigan’s 
new-meets-old 
offensive 
identity.
Hassan Haskins’ growth
At the center of Michigan’s 
reborn faith in its run game is 
redshirt freshman running back 
Hassan Haskins.
All season, the headlines — 
at least when it comes to the 
Wolverines’ 
running 
backs 
— 
have 
surrounded 
Zach 
Charbonnet, 
the 
freshman 
sensation 
whose 
nine 
touchdowns are tied-most for 
a 
Michigan 
freshman. 
And 
Charbonnet, regardless of how 
this season ends, is the future at 
the position.
But 
despite 
Charbonnet’s 
4.9 yards per carry, Michigan’s 
coaches 
have 
continually 
expressed a desire to share the 
workload at running back. The 
problem through five games was 

that no one stepped up.
Tru 
Wilson 
broke 
his 
hand 
in 
the 
season-opener 
and has struggled to regain 
form. Christian Turner lost 
the coaching staff’s faith in 
pass protection, regained it 
and 
started 
fumbling. 
Ben 
VanSumeren has nine carries 
for 20 yards.
Now, 
in 
Haskins, 
the 
Wolverines finally seem to have 
found a viable second option, 
punctuated by two 100-yard 
performances in his last three 
games.
And 
that, 
as 
good 
as 
Charbonnet may be, is what 
makes running 50 times a game 
possible.
Can the defense get its 
second shutout of the year?
Normally, in this section, I 
write something about what 
Michigan 
can 
prove 
going 
forward.
The 
problem 
is, 
playing 
Maryland doesn’t provide the 
opportunity to do much of 

that. The Terrapins are missing 
starting 
quarterback 
Josh 
Jackson and have scored more 
than 17 points just twice in their 
last six games.
To really prove something 
against 
Maryland, 
the 
Wolverines will have to do 
something that’s eluded them 
in 
back-to-back 
impressive 
performances: avoid mistakes 
and shut out the opposition. 
And sure, the Terrapins’ offense 
isn’t the same as Penn State’s 
or Notre Dame’s, but neither is 
Illinois’ and Michigan gave up 
25 points to the Fighting Illini.
The common thread between 
all three of those games has been 
minor defensive lapses — such 
as the missed communication 
on Penn State’s game-winning 
touchdown — that sullied the 
final 
scores 
of 
otherwise-
shutdown showings.
Doing the same thing against 
Maryland won’t spell disaster. 
Winning 49-0 or 49-14 means 
little in the grand scheme of 

things. Doing the same thing 
a month from now — or even 
against Indiana’s potent offense 
— could bring the same ending 
as it did in State College.
Score Prediction
Michigan, 
as 
has 
been 
established by now, should have 
little trouble taking care of 
Maryland. The question for the 
Wolverines is where Saturday 
afternoon falls on the spectrum 
of a 42-25 escape against Illinois 
to a 52-0 rout over Rutgers. 
Given the dominance this team 
has displayed on both sides of 
the ball over its last six quarters, 
I’m taking the latter.
Prediction: Michigan 45-3
