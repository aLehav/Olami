In a poll of students conducted 

by The Daily earlier this month, 
a 
majority 
said 
they 
were 

unfamiliar 
with 
Michigan’s 

gubernatorial 
candidates 
this 

year. The Daily talked to several 
major candidates to help provide 
a guide.

The poll was sent to 500 

students. Of the respondents, 
32 percent of students said they 
are most likely to vote for Abdul 
El-Sayed, while 48 percent of 
respondents 
said 
they 
were 

unsure whom they would vote for.

Over 72 percent of the students 

reported they were registered 
to vote in the state of Michigan 
and 70 percent said they are 
planning on voting in the 2018 
gubernatorial election.

Fifty-two percent of students 

said they were not familiar at 
all with the candidates, while 0 

percent said they were very 
familiar.

Of the respondents, 10 percent 

said they would vote for a political 
party different than the one they 
voted for in the 2016 presidential 
election, suggesting either they do 
not like the direction their party 
is going in or they expect different 
policies for local government. 

Meanwhile, 
74 
percent 
of 

students said they would vote for 
the same party as they did in the 
presidential election, while 16 
percent remained unsure.

Democratic 
candidate 

Gretchen Whitmer is currently 
the 
Democratic 
frontrunner, 

polling at 37 percent, tied to 
Republican 
frontrunner 
Bill 

Schuette, according to the Detroit 
Free Press in September.

According to campaign finance 

reports 
released 
Wednesday, 

Whitmer’s campaign holds $1.5 

million in bank balance, following 
$768,000 raised this quarter for 
a total of $2.3 million raised this 
election cycle.

Whitmer began her political 

career in Michigan’s Congress, 
serving for six years in the House 
of Representative and serving in 
the state Senate since. In 2010 she 
was chosen to be the state Senate 
democratic leader, making her 
the first female leader of a party 
caucus in the Senate. However, 
Whitmer said it isn’t her gender 
that sets her apart from other 

Talk of carbon dioxide in U.S. 

politics usually revolves around 
how to reduce its emission 
into the atmosphere. However, 
this narrative was rebuked by 
entrepreneur 
Bernard 
David, 

founder of the Global CO2 
Initiative, who spoke about how 
to turn carbon dioxide from an 
environmental liability into an 
asset at an event Wednesday 
afternoon 
sponsored 
by 
the 

Graham Sustainability Institute.

“It’s transforming CO2 into 

an asset, and CO2 is usually 
a negative,” said Engineering 
freshman 
Loren 
Mata, 
who 

attended the seminar as an 
elective requirement for one of 
her engineering classes.

David’s 
organization, 
the 

Global CO2 Initiative, hopes to 
make products out of carbon 
dioxide, which he estimates could 
be a $1 trillion business by 2030 if 
“all the stars align.”

“Climate change is one of the 

most complex challenges of our 
time. Left unaddressed, it will 
continue to cross geographic, 
social, and financial barriers 
— 
altering 
ecosystems 
and 

fundamentally changing life as we 
know it,” the initiative’s website 
reads.

David believes taking a business 

approach to tackling climate 
change with long-term solutions, 
like those advocated by the Global 
CO2 Initiative, will help mitigate 
environmental problems.

“In a free market economy, 

unless you can make a business 
case about something, it’s not 
going to work. People only care 
about doing the right thing for a 
certain amount of time,” David 
said.

Despite his current line of work, 

David’s path to the sustainability 
business was not intuitive. He did 
not have a science background 
and had worked as a businessman 
for years until he retired 17 years 

ago in his early 40s.

About that time, 9/11 happened. 

The attacks motivated his father-
in-law, an artist, to draw a 
timeline depicting the evolution 
of man. This led David to reflect 
on the vulnerability of humans in 
today’s world.

“I realized that we as a species 

want to be here for a while,” David 
said.

He realized humans embraced 

a 
short-term 
mindset, 
and 

he sought to find a long-term 
solution to climate change. While 
talking to research scientists 
at the California Institute of 
Technology, he realized that 
carbon dioxide, which composed 
82 percent of greenhouse gas 
emissions in the United States 
in 2015, could be turned into an 
asset.

Pitching his political platform, 

State 
Sen. 
Patrick 
Colbeck, 

gubernatorial 
candidate, 

R-Canton, spoke to members 
of the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Republicans 
on Wednesday at the Michigan 
Union.

The students in attendance 

gathered to question the second-
term 
state 
senator, 
who 
is 

known to be among the most 
conservative members of the 
chamber on issues ranging from 
Obamacare to road maintenance 
— in 2015, 56 percent of non-
federally funded roads were in 
poor condition, according to the 
Michigan Transportation Asset 
Management Council.

LSA senior Enrique Zalamea, 

president of College Republicans, 
said he invited Colbeck before 
frontrunner 
Bill 
Schuette 

because an internal straw poll 
of College Republicans indicated 
that he was the most popular 
of the Republican candidates.

In today’s contentious political 

climate, it can be difficult to find 
common ground with others of 
opposing viewpoints. To combat 
this, political science professor 
Arthur Lupia, created the class 
“Beyond Partisanship.”

“Beyond 
Partisanship” 

intends to find common ground 
on important issues like the 
opioid 
crisis, 
homelessness 

and housing security, among 
others. It addition, it hopes to 
push students to find tangible 
solutions to these problems.

When approached to create 

this undergraduate course, Lupia 
sought to encourage students to 
facilitate discussion with those 
of differing ideologies.

“The aim is to find issues on 

which 70 percent of Republicans 
and 70 percent of Democrats 
agree,” Lupia said. “We want to 
identify those problems, as well 
as real solutions, in both the 
private and public sectors, and 
bring them to the table.”

World War II in the UMMA Wednesday.

UNCOVE RING THE PA ST

According to USA Today’s 

annual ranking of National 
Collegiate Athletic Association 
coaches’ salaries, Jim Harbaugh is 
no longer the highest-paid coach in 
football.

The University of Michigan 

football coach’s 2017 salary of 
$7,004,000 earned him third place, 
after University of Alabama’s Nick 
Saban and Clemson University’s 
Dabo Swinney. Following Jim 
Harbaugh in fourth is Ohio State 
University’s Urban Meyer.

Saban had been the highest-paid 

coach in college football for six of 
the past seven years –– all except 
Harbaugh’s 2016 reign in which he 
made $9,004,000. In 2017, Saban 
earned $11,132,000. Swinney will 
earn $8,526,000 after Clemson’s 
national championship win earlier 
this year.

Harbaugh is signed into a 

seven-year contract that started 
in December 2014. This contract 

pays him a $500,000 base salary 
plus a $4.5 million compensation 
for media and promotional 
appearances. Additionally, 
Harbaugh has an annual $2 million 
life insurance policy that he can 
draw from.

Starting in January, Harbaugh’s 

annual compensation will increase 
to about $7.5 million, when he 
receives a 10 percent raise to his 
base salary.

Based only off his base salary, 

Harbaugh is the 13th highest-paid 
University employee. University 
President Mark Schlissel’s salary 
totals $823,523 after his third pay 
raise.

Harbaugh’s career at the 

University has brought him a 25-8 
record, with the team earning 
two 10-win seasons. However, the 
Wolverines’ current record of 5-2 
has some fans hoping for better 
performance.

ON THE DAILY: HARBAUGH’S 
PUTTING THE L IN SALARY

candidates, but her work ethic.

“More than anything, what 

we need is real leadership who 
knows how to get things done in 
Michigan, and I think that sets 
me apart in a way that’s not as 
obvious as gender, but it certainly 
sets me apart from the rest of the 
field,” Whitmer said. “We’ve got a 
lot of work to do here in our state 
and getting things done … there’s 
no time to wait. I’m really excited 
because I think it’s been a long 
time since Michiganders have 
had someone in their corner.”

LSA senior Collin Kelly, who 

works on Whitmer’s campaign, 
reiterated Whitmer’s work ethic 
and said her work in Michigan’s 
Senate has produced tangible 
change.

“Ever since I saw Gretchen 

Whitmer speak at a College 
Democrats meeting last winter, I 
knew she was someone I wanted 
to work for and help get elected. 
The way she talked about her 
ideas for Michigan and how 
much of her life she had spent 
fighting for us was so genuine 
and inspiring,” Kelly said. “She’s 
already walked the walk. She 
expanded Medicaid, raised the 
minimum wage and stood up for 
unions while in the minority in 
the Michigan legislature.”

Whitmer said one of the 

biggest goals in her campaign 
involves making education more 
affordable. While in the Senate, 
Whitmer 
authored 
Michigan 

2020, legislation that would pay 
for every Michigan student’s 
four-year university tuition by 
closing corporate tax loopholes.

“I spent my whole life here 

in Michigan and I am a proud 
product of our public schools. I 
even taught at the University of 
Michigan. I know that one thing 
that levels the playing field is a 
great education,” Whitmer said. 
“I recognize how critical it is 
that it’s affordable for students 
in Michigan. If we would have 
passed it, Bernie (Sanders) would 
have been talking about what we 
did in Michigan instead of his 
own plan.”

Kelly agreed that her education 

policy sets her apart from other 
candidates, considering how long 
she’s been fighting for a change 
in policy.

“As a first-generation college 

student, her education policy 
shows how committed she is to 
students. She was introducing 
plans to make college free for 
Michiganders 
before 
Bernie 

Sanders made it a national issue,” 
Kelly said. “She’s always been 
in our corner, and I couldn’t be 
more excited to help make her 
our next governor.”

Michigan Attorney General 

Bill Schuette is running for 
the 
Republican 
nomination, 

emphasizing 
improving 
the 

economy through tax cuts and 
increasing jobs, which he said 
would ultimately keep young 
people in the state.

Currently 
the 
Republican 

frontrunner, 
Schuette 
was 

endorsed by President Donald 
Trump in September via tweet.

The original tweet garnered 

national attention after Trump 
misspelled the candidate’s name.

In 
terms 
of 
fundraising, 

Schuette is also leading his 
opponents, with a reported $2 
million on hand, following a $1.2 

million quarter and $3.2 million 
this cycle.

The economy is a central 

focus of Schuette’s campaign, 
as he sees improving it as a key 
way to solve many of Michigan’s 
problems. He emphasized the 
need to continue recovering 
from the policies of former Gov. 
Jennifer Granholm, who served 
from 2003 to 2011.

“Michigan suffered on the lost 

decade of Jennifer Granholm, 
where we lost jobs, we lost 
paychecks, we lost people, a 
million people … left our state 
because 
of 
the 
devastating 

economic policies of Jennifer 
Granholm. Higher taxes, higher 
rules, more regulations. We hit 
bottom. Michigan was on life 
support.”

University 
of 
Michigan 

lecturer Rusty Hills, director 
of public affairs for Schuette, 
said Schuette has proven his 
competence 
regarding 
many 

issues he has attacked as attorney 
general, 
including 
human 

trafficking, 
supplying 
rape 

test kits and his anti-bullying 
program.

“I 
think 
he’s 
doing 
an 

outstanding 
job 
as 
attorney 

general, and the most important 
thing you can do for future 
office is a good job in the office 
you hold,” Hills said. “So on a 
wide range of issues, I feel like 
Bill Schuette’s done a great job 
as attorney general. I think that 
will help him in this race for 
governor.”

Through 
reviving 
the 

economy, Schuette said, young 
people will want to stay in 
the state rather than leave. 
Michigan’s population declined 
for the fifth straight year in 2016.

“I want Michigan to be 

a growth state, a paycheck 
state and a job state. I want 
to help usher in a new era of 
prosperity and opportunity and 
jobs in Michigan. In order to 
achieve that, we need to have 
a jobs governor and that’ll be 
my focus day in and day out,” 
Schuette said. “And we need to 
… pick up the pace, and we need 
to be a growth state, where 
there’s more opportunity. So 
when you’re done going to 
college, I want you to stay here 
in Michigan.”

Schuette said going forward, 

several projects he aims to do 
to include achieve the growth 
he sees is possible in Michigan. 
First, rolling back of the tax 
increases put forward while 
Granholm was governor to 
give “every Michiganian a pay 
raise,” and second, enacting 
auto 
insurance 
reform, 
as 

Michigan’s is one of the highest 
in the nation.

Four 
years 
ago, 
I 
had 

assumed that my parents were 
complete animal enthusiasts. 
They 
came 
home 
every 

night after long shifts at our 
restaurant seemingly eager 
to turn on Animal Planet. My 
mom would call me over to 
watch, giggling at the frenzied 
yet astute organization of 
meerkat 
manors. 
My 
dad 

would gawk at the ferocious 
pace 
of 
lionesses 
chasing 

zebras across the Serengeti. 
At garage sales, he could 
never resist bringing home a 
stack of National Geographic 
magazines. 
We’ve 
housed 

nearly every animal allowed as 
a pet by the state of Michigan.

I was obviously wrong.
It’s clear today that they 

could 
not 
care 
less. 
My 

parents cheer enthusiastically 
at “Sing! China” and other 
knock-off music competitions. 
The browsing history of our 
home computer is filled with 
2000s-esque online tabloids 
divulging the latest Asian 
celebrity 
scandal. 
Their 

smartphones constantly blow 
up with WeChat pings from 
their friends across the world. 
There are no more Discovery 
Channel specials documenting 
the 
inscrutable 
beauty 
of 

wild dolphins; instead, now 
my parents only discover the 
“unbelievable” talent of the 
Dolphin Princess. They spend 
hours glued to a screen, eyes 
welling up when prompted and 
laughing exactly as scripted. 
It’s the mindless media every 
baby boomer life coach warns 
against. But this was exactly 
what I wanted.

There’s 
a 
charming 

simplicity and boredom to life 
in the American Midwest. It’s 
the birthplace of the five-day 
work week, the 9 to 5 shift 
and church on Sunday. My 
parents, however, were never 
part of this simple life. They 
arrived by boat, uneducated, 
unskilled and unable to speak 
a lick of English. They opened 
a small takeout restaurant 
in western Michigan, where 
they worked endless hours 
to support our family in the 
New World. Our restaurant is 
among the oldest in the city; 
my grandma’s garden in the 
front earned it a mention in 
the Muskegon Chronicle. My 
parents’ unmistakable effort 
and spirit of entrepreneurship 
fits neatly into the myth of the 
American Dream. It’s exactly 
the 
false 
consciousness 

surrounding upward mobility 
— their success obscures how 
so many others are failed by 
the invisible hand, how we 
lived anxiously without health 
insurance, how we became 
too 
accustomed 
to 
armed 

robberies.

I could count the number 

of Chinese families I know 
living back home with one 
hand. Though it’s a cliché in 
the coming-of-age stories of 
other Asian/Pacific Islander 
American kids from small-

town America, I wrestled 
with the sense of “otherness” 
and assimilation. But it was 
during my senior year of 
high school when I began to 
think, what about my parents? 
While I could easily Facetime 
people on the other side of the 
planet, they were still buying 
international calling cards to 
reconnect for mere minutes 
with their friends back home. 
In 2013, my parents had never 
logged onto a computer; they 
had never sent a text message 
over the phone. To be frank, 
they 
were 
ignorant, 
but 

perhaps not in bliss. Were they 
bored? Were they lonely these 
last 20-or-so years? Maybe my 
dad kept replaying the same 
CDs because he had no idea 
where to find new Chinese 
music. Maybe they spent so 
much time watching wildlife 
because 
those 
programs 

didn’t 
require 
English 

comprehension.

After lobbying my parents 

for 
months, 
they 
finally 

bought a computer. I sought 
their digital enlightenment. 
They could chat instantly 
with their friends across the 
world. With Google Maps, 
they could retrace their old 
neighborhoods back in China. 
Though they were comfortable 
with the fact that my brother 
and I had been surfing the 
internet for years, they were 
ferociously 
resistant 
to 

idea that they do the same. 
“We’re too old for this!” 
they’d complain — an excuse 
too common in immigrant 
households.

From the mundane like 

translating 
during 
grocery 

trips to the complex like 
explaining tax forms, there 
are 
numerous 
moments 

where 
immigrant 
children 

become the parents. It was 
humiliating for my parents to 
have established a thriving 
business, only to struggle to 
use a keyboard. I’d sit with 
them for hours at a time, 
guiding their mouse across 
the 
browser. 
Sometimes 

when they got it (the red “x” 
means exit), I’d see a childlike 
sense 
of 
accomplishment 

spread across their faces. But, 

inevitably, we’d get frustrated. 
We’d argue. They’d call me a 
“Si zi.” I’d tell them “I can’t 
do this anymore!” We’d storm 
off, only later to return — no 
apologies — and simply try 
again.

Soon, they became semi-

proficient. They could turn 
the computer on and off 
and learned to open Google 
Chrome. It was good enough. 
Understanding 
how 
to 

browse the internet was their 
watershed 
moment. 
And 

before I left for Ann Arbor, 
they 
wanted 
smartphones 

with WeChat and Weibo, a 
way to stream Chinese cable, 
and instructions on how to 
download music. I have a 
disdain for mass media, but 
when my mother received 
her first WeChat voicemails 
from childhood friends who 
asked, “Yan Li! What took 
you so long???” and I saw 
the excitement and joy that 
raced through her existence, 
I decided I’ll always put aside 
my thoughts for them.

One day, my mom caught me 

off guard while I was home for 
Fall Break. She had prepared 
a simple, nostalgic lunch for 
my return: steamed rice with 
Lachang. As she watched me 
eat, she remarked, “They gave 
our restaurant four out of five 
stars.” The reviews. Who told 
her? For every one bad review, 
there are 20 other to drown 
them out, but everyone, my 
parents included, wants to 
hear criticism. I was annoyed 
and surprised that she had 
discovered the online reviews 
of our restaurant on her own. 
Perhaps her friend Rose from 
Milwaukee told her about 
it. We chatted about how 
our competitors were only 
three stars and how some 
restaurants didn’t even show 
up. She was surprised that 
people even liked the food in 
the first place and then joked 
about how funny life was 
where two Chinese “peasants” 
could become successful in 
America. Playing into her 
humble boast, I pretended to 
be delightfully shocked.

“Hunter, can you translate 

the reviews for me?”

Thank 
God 
I 
never 

taught 
her 
how 
to 
use 

Google Translate. If you’ve 
interpreted languages before, 
you know the three most 
important things are syntax, 
meaning and context. But it 
only matters if you’re trying to 
be truthful.

I, like other children of 

immigrants, chose to lie to my 
parents.

The language barrier that 

had been the root of so much 
childhood 
self-hatred 
and 

embarrassment became my 
saving grace. I never thought 
that teaching my parents to 
use a computer could ever 
backfire. Right now, my mom 
doesn’t know how to translate 
and read the reviews, but 
eventually she will. She’ll get 
better on the computer. She’ll 
discover that she doesn’t need 
me. And she’ll read them.

My parents didn’t come 

here to run a Michelin-starred 
restaurant; they came here to 
give their children a better 
chance at life. Leaving their 
dreams behind, they provided 
me the ultimate opportunity 
to pursue mine: a life free 
from poverty and oppression. 
I can never fully describe 
the sacrifices they made, the 
barriers they overcame. Even 
if hot vegetable oil burns and 
blisters my arms — just like 
my father’s — from stir-frying 
“cheap” takeout food for self-
proclaimed Chinese culinary 
experts, my life is still better 
than it would have been.

Instead of a conspiracy of 

ripping off customers with 
“garbage food,” maybe we 
don’t 
accept 
credit 
cards 

because 
my 
parents 
don’t 

know how to use them. Maybe 
the girl who “is a complete 
moron” struggles on the phone 
because we didn’t have money 
for English lessons. Maybe it 
“is not Chinese at all” because 
actual Chinese people don’t 
eat General Tso’s Chicken 
as their plat principal with a 
fortune cookie as dessert.

Maybe 
the 
reason 
why 

our white rice is “excellent” 
isn’t because we followed the 
directions on some bag. It’s 
because my parents learned to 

cook it perfectly when it was 
the only thing their families 
could afford. That every last 
morsel mattered back then. 
That even when you burned 
it, you scraped the charred 
bottom crust and ate it to ease 
the pain of hunger. That before 
my dad was even a teenager — 
his house stripped bare by the 
government, his parents sent 
to labor camps, his older sisters 
deported for “reeducation,” 
his family blacklisted by the 
community and the survival of 
two siblings left in his hands 
alone — he would wait outside 
homes in the middle of the 
night to wait his turn to dig 
through their trash and find 
smashed remnants of soured, 
rotten white rice, bring it 
home to soak it in water so 
that the ants would float up 
top to be poured away, and 
fed to his younger brother and 
sister so they wouldn’t starve. 
He’d eagerly eat what was left 
of the rancid slurry.

How can a single comment 

so effectively, so easily erase 
the histories of my family? In 
this digital age, anonymity 
begets such cold cruelty. And 
in truth, I can’t bring myself to 
blame them. It’d be unrealistic 
to demand that customers 
censor their thoughts — they 
have the right to express a 
bad experience. Honestly, the 
comments people leave for 
our restaurant are hilariously 
creative. 
Nevertheless, 
as 

the restaurant owners’ son, I 
can’t help but overreact at the 
ignorance and insensitivity of 
these comments. I can’t help 
but be defensive.

They probably wrote those 

reviews in less than two 
minutes, mindlessly thumbing 
characters, 
uncaring 
about 

who the audience was and 
what the impact would be. 
Four out of five stars doesn’t 
just represent the success of 
our restaurant; it’s validation 
of my parents’ lives — their 
journey, their challenge, their 
success.

I know I shouldn’t be worked 

up. I know these comments 
mean nothing. I know my 
mom is a lion, strongest among 
beasts and turns away from

Black girl,

I like your hair,

The way it defies gravity

And holds its shape,

The way it curls

Once water hits,

Forehead to nape.

Black girl,

Can’ t you see?

You can do anything

To your hair.

Wear it up or down,

No one should really care. 

Wear it with a relaxer

Or wear it with curls.

Look in the mirror

And watch how it swirls.

Add color in it

Or keep it deep brown,

But whatever you do,

Wear your own crown.

Black girl,

I like your hair.

Black girl,

Life is a dare.

TANISHA SHELTON

who has this position

no one. Even if I translated them 
faithfully, she’d probably be fine; but 
I have a brutal sense of protection 
towards my family. I would never 
let anything, not even the minutiae 
of online restaurant reviews, come 
close or even attempt to chip away at 
their accomplishments.

I will never.
“Mom, they love the food. They 

said everything was affordable and 
delicious.”

Her ears perk up. She sets her 

eyes on me, her subtle smile clear. 
She’s proud — a pride distinct from 
reading any kind of review. She’s 
proud to have kept her end of the 
immigrant bargain and prouder that 
I’m about to keep mine. Come April, 
I will no longer be a first-generation 
college student; I’ll be an alum. 
After my graduation, our restaurant 
will finally close its doors having 
achieved its purpose.

I wish I didn’t have to lie, but then 

again, I am her stubborn and selfish 
American son. No more translations 
of reviews. “There’s no need,” I 
constantly assure her. “Nothing has 
changed.” Because of course, our 
white rice will always be excellent.

T

he 
United 
States, 

the 
world’s 
leading 

manufacturer 

of 
prisoners, 
has 
an 

incarceration problem. 

A rapid rise in incarceration 

rates has crippled the U.S. over 
the past three decades. During 
these years, the number of 
inmates in U.S. prisons has risen 
500 percent. As a result, the 
United States pays $80 billion 
annually in incarceration costs. 
$80 billion. That’s money that 
could go toward keeping Social 
Security 
solvent, 
supporting 

climate change research or 
rebuilding infrastructure. But 
in the United States, we spend it 
on putting citizens behind bars.

American 
imprisonment 

habits are not normal, by the 
way. The U.S. has a prison 
population of nearly 2.2 million 
people, compared with China’s 
1.5 million (despite the fact that, 
in 2011, China’s population was 
four times as large) and Great 
Britain’s 
mere 
80,000. 
Are 

Americans just more dangerous? 
What’s going on?

In 
truth, 
there 
isn’t 
a 

problem 
with 
Americans. 

There is, however, a problem 
with American laws. Federal 
mandatory minimum-sentence 
laws cause the economic and 
cultural disaster known as 
mass incarceration. Current 
law dictates that judges must 
hand down minimum sentences 
for a variety of crimes, ranging 
from 
immigration 
offenses 

to illegal food stamp activity 
to bank robbery. Mandatory 
minimums are fiscally and 
socially 
destructive; 
they 

create 
one-size-fits-all 

sentences that lengthen jail 
time for undeserving criminals 
and cost taxpayers money.

The 
incarceration 
process 

is unfair and we can’t afford it 
anymore. The fix is simple: stop 
locking so many people up.

To do this, we need a 

safety 
valve 
— 
exceptions 

to minimums that provide 
ways in which judges can 
avoid handing down harsh 

punishments that too often 
have 
unjust, 
unintended 

results. For example, statutory 
laws might force a judge to 
sentence someone to 10 years 
in prison for selling pot. If, 
however, the judge sees the 
person he’s sentencing has 
no criminal history and no 
history of violence, he can 
adjust the verdict to something 
less life-altering by way of the 
safety valve.

Safety 
valves 
can 
be 

incredibly powerful in fighting 
the mass incarceration crisis; 
this is why U.S. law already 
dictates one. The current safety 
valve is described in § 3553(f) of 
Title 18 of the U.S. Code. Under 
the provision, federal judges 
are to hand down sentences 
“without regard to any statutory 
minimum sentence” when five 
requirements are met. Good 
news, right?

There’s 
an 
issue: 
The 

aforementioned 
safety 
valve 

applies 
only 
to 
first-time, 

nonviolent drug offenders in 
cases not involving guns. This is 
a ridiculously narrow offering. 
Since the provision applies only 
to first-time offenders, even 
the most minor misconduct has 
disqualifying power. So, too, 
does possession of a gun, even 
one that is registered.

The 
safety 
valve 
must 

expand across the board for all 
federal crimes. The existing 
one-size-fits-all 
system 
of 

judicial 
sentencing 
leads 

to 
too 
many 
unwarranted 

punishments, which, in turn, 
have drastic negative effects 
on the economy. More money 
is 
spent 
keeping 
prisons 

running, while fewer able-
bodied Americans can supply 
the workforce.

The 
country’s 
social 

atmosphere also takes a hit, as 
high incarceration rates break 
up families and induce this 
crushing statistic: In 2010, 1 
in 28 American children had a 
parent behind bars. Having a 
parent in jail can be detrimental 
to a child’s well-being. A report 

from 
the 
Urban 
Institute 

found these kids are more 
likely to experience chronic 
sleeplessness, 
difficulties 

concentrating and restlessness. 
They also are more likely to 
have problems with depression, 
anxiety or aggression.

Put it all together and 

we’re left with a vicious cycle 
that not only damages the 
U.S. economy, but also leaves 
kids parentless and, often, 
emotionally scarred. 

The Justice Safety Valve 

Act proposes a broad policy 
that applies to all federal 
crimes that carry mandatory 
minimum sentences. The bill 
requires nothing of federal 
judges, since they would still 
be able to sentence at or beyond 
the mandatory minimum. The 
plan would simply give judges 
more flexibility.

It’s safe to assume that U.S. 

incarceration 
rates 
would 

shrink if this bill is passed. 
Taxpayer money could flow 
back 
toward 
rebuilding 

highways and revamping our 
education system, and parents 
would spend less time behind 
bars and more time watching 
their children grow up.

Unfortunately, 
the 

Justice Safety Valve Act was 
introduced last May in the 
Senate and hasn’t been touched 
since. Lawmakers don’t seem to 
realize the positive economic 
and cultural effects that would 
come out of its passage.

In essence, it’s a common-

sense idea: Judges should have 
a high degree of flexibility 
when making their decisions. 
Of course, the far-reaching 
issue of mass incarceration 
won’t be solved with the 
passage 
of 
one 
law. 
But 

attacking the problem will 
take time and effort. Why not 
start with a piece of legislation 
that saves taxpayers money 
and gives our federal judges a 
little more flexibility?

I 

opened 
my 
computer 

last Monday night and 
saw so many posts with 

#MeToo. 
Curious 

about what it was 
all about, I turned 
to Google. On Oct. 
15, actress Alyssa 
Milano 
tweeted, 

“Suggested 
by 
a 

friend: If all the 
women who have 
been 
sexually 

harassed 
or 

assaulted 
wrote 

‘Me too’ as a status, 
we might give people a sense 
of 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 

problem.” I kept scrolling and 
scrolling through the posts, 
shocked to see my peers, 
teachers and family members 
post openly about their sexual 
abuse and harassment stories. 
I couldn’t believe the number 
of posts there were, and I felt 
comforted by the number of 
allies I had to relate to and 
share my experiences with. 

I, too, could have posted 

#MeToo, but I didn’t. While 
I respect and understand 
how 
survivors 
could 
feel 

personally 
supported 
in 

posting this, I also found 
it 
oversaturated 
social 

media and resulted in a less 
impactful message. I couldn’t 
help but think about the 
large audience who would 
be viewing these posts: men. 
While 1 in 6 men are sexually 
abused or assaulted, the rates 
for women are much higher. 

Don’t get me wrong: I want 

to raise awareness about this 
movement. I am also a victim 
of systematic sexism and want 
to create change for myself 
and others. Women should 
be treated with respect in 
all facets of their lives, and 

their experiences of hurt and 
trauma should not be brushed 
under the rug. 

But 
in 
that 

moment, I thought I 
didn’t have to share 
my story because 
so many others did. 
I have always felt 
my experience was 
not 
as 
traumatic 

as 
others, 
which 

is 
why 
I 
didn’t 

post 
about 
it. 
I 

felt I would have 
exaggerated 
my 

experiences by posting about 
it. But when I thought about 
this idea in the context of 
voting in an election, I realized 
the invalidity of my claim. 
Every vote counts, and in this 
situation, every person who 
has experienced sexual assault 
in any capacity counts. 

Even though I don’t like to 

plaster my opinion all over the 
internet, I still see the value 
in #MeToo. I know that I am 
not alone in feeling hesitation 
to 
share 
a 
controversial 

opinion via the internet. A lot 
of the time, young women are 
afraid to spark controversy in 
fear of the backlash we will 
receive from others. Men hold 
so much power within our 
society that women’s voices 
can often be overshadowed 
or disregarded. Women are 
conditioned to believe that 
their opinion is inferior to 
that of men.

Women who were assaulted 

by Harvey Weinstein were 
afraid to speak out about 
their experiences in fear of 
losing their jobs, social status 
and reputation. The power 
men hold in society has been 
around for centuries, and 
though women have come 

so far in the struggle for 
gender equality, like gaining 
the right to vote and equal 
minimum wage for men and 
women, we still have a long 
way to go.

This was the first time 

I 
noticed 
women’s 
voices 

elevated over men’s. This 
made me realize how powerful 
we can be and that we need 
to move beyond speaking out 
only when something bad 
happens. We need to take 
proactive 
action 
and 
talk 

about these hardships even 
when they aren’t trending in 
pop culture.

The stories of hurt and 

abuse through #MeToo are 
very powerful, and I have 
respect for those brave enough 
to share their experiences. 
Though I did not post, I had 
many intelligent conversations 
with men and women who 
were deeply shocked by what 
had happened and are ready to 
raise awareness and advocate 
for change. I am not expecting 
sexual assault to evaporate 
from society overnight, but it 
is the small conversations in 
coffee shops or dorm rooms 
that allow us to confide in 
one another to create change. 
Whether these conversations 
planted seeds in the minds of 
others or a conversation gave 
new perspective about these 
issues, the way we discuss 
with those around us has 
potential for stepping one step 
closer to equality.

In order to make change, we 

should share our knowledge 
and experiences with others 
all the time — not just when a 
hashtag is trending.

Hawkishness and hypocrisy

BRETT GRAHAM | COLUMN

I

f you’ve been following the 
developing story about the 
Trump 
administration’s 

response to the deaths of 
four American soldiers in 
Niger earlier this month, 
chances are you have 
some questions. After 
brushing up on your 
geography, you might 
ask, for instance, what 
were U.S. armed forces 
doing there in the first 
place? You wouldn’t 
be alone in wondering 
this. In fact, you would 
be in the company of at least two 
U.S. senators. 

Last Sunday, Sen. Lindsey 

Graham, R-S.C., who sits on the 
Committee on Armed Services, 
admitted on NBC’s “Meet the 
Press” that he was not even 
aware of a U.S. presence in Niger. 
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, 
D-N.Y., 
echoed 
a 
similar 

sentiment in another interview 
on the same day. Beyond the 
eye-catching headlines about a 
feud between the commander 
in chief and members of Gold 
Star families — and a circus of 
punditry about indecency that 
should no longer be shocking to 
anyone anymore — the timing 
of such a display of ignorance 
reflects something frightening. 
This country’s military spending 
is out of control, and the only 
people who can rein it in are 
either too scared or too oblivious 
to even bring it up for debate.

Last 
Thursday 
night, 
the 

Senate 
passed 
its 
budget 

resolution for the fiscal year 
2018 by a vote of 51-49. Though 
this vote may not have been 
surrounded 
by 
as 
much 

media coverage as the health 
care vote was in July, it was 
equally 
dramatic. 
Perennial 

nonconformist Sen. Rand Paul, 
R-Ky., broke ranks with his party 
to oppose the measure, eliciting 
an avalanche of criticism from 
his Republican colleagues. His 
opposition was based primarily 
in $43 billion of increased 
military spending that would 
use a loophole to exceed limits 
set in 2011. Not one of his 51 
fellow members of the GOP, all 
of whom no doubt campaign on 
that phrase conservatives so like 
to use — “balancing the budget” 
— seemed to agree.

In doing so, Paul solidified 

his position as one of the few 
members of Congress who has 
not rolled over in the face of 
President 
Trump’s 
massive 

hikes in military spending. In 
September, he was one of only 
eight senators to vote against 

the administration’s 
$700 billion defense 
policy bill, which 
included 
increased 

funding 
nearly 

across 
the 
board, 

shelling out billions 
at 
a 
time. 
This 

group 
included 

five (yes, only five) 
Democrats. 
The 

rest of the so-called 
liberal 
opposition 

party took out their rubber 
stamps 
and 
issued 
bland 

statements about how proud they 
were to be supporting the brave 
men and women of our military.

I’d like to pause here for a 

minute and make clear that I, 
too, respect these brave men 
and women. I appreciate their 
service and all that they do to 
make this country, and in many 
cases the world, a safer place. 
Furthermore, I’m neither an 
isolationist nor a pacifist. I 
understand the importance of a 
global U.S. presence, and I’m not 
advocating for an end to defense 
spending. But a few things need 
to be established.

First of all, the Republicans 

who 
champion 
these 
hikes 

should no longer be permitted to 
brand themselves as champions 
of fiscal conservatism. Writing 
checks for billions of dollars 
at a time to expand a sector 
that already accounts for such 
an enormous portion of the 
national budget and claiming 
prudence are mutually exclusive 
actions. 
Defense 
spending 

was only just projected to be 
returning to peacetime levels 
thanks to de-escalation in Iraq 
and 
Afghanistan, 
but 
these 

developments show that it is 
poised to climb back up. These 
are the same officials who 
target 
funding 
for 
National 

Public Radio and the National 
Endowment for the Arts in their 
efforts to rein in spending, which 
is a bit like buying a Rolls Royce 
and then complaining that the $3 
air freshener you bought to hang 
from the rearview mirror is what 
broke the bank.

Second of all, Democrats must 

be made to answer for these votes 
in the future. With the exception 
of 
the 
five 
aforementioned 

senators — Bernie Sanders, 
D-Vt.; 
Kirstin 
Gillibrand, 

D-N.Y.; Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; 
Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.; and Ron 

Wyden, D-Ore. — all 43 others, 
many of whom have hopes 
for 2020, need to explain how 
approving this runaway train 
works toward a more progressive 
future with better jobs, better 
health care and better education.

Democratic primary voters 

should remember this vote in 
three years as they evaluate 
names like Elizabeth Warren, 
D-Mass.; 
Kamala 
Harris, 

D-Calif.; 
and 
Cory 
Booker, 

D-N.J. In a broader sense, is 
the party really so inept that it 
cannot formulate an argument 
that says simply, “We respect 
the military as much as the next 
guy, but sometimes the more 
patriotic thing to do is to spend 
that dollar in a classroom and not 
researching self-driving tanks?” 

Finally, the shocking lack 

of oversight is unsustainable. 
There’s not much to say here 
other 
than 
if 
the 
military 

expects nearly a trillion dollars 
of taxpayer money to be at its 
disposal on an annual basis, it’s not 
too much to ask for senators on the 
Committee of Armed Services to 
know where that money and those 
troops are going.

In 
the 
Declaration 
of 

Independence, 
in 
between 

grievances about taxation and 
representation, one of the most 
severe charges against King George 
III was that he had “render(ed) 
the Military independent of and 
superior to the Civil Power.” This 
foundational skepticism played a 
pivotal role in the formation of the 
executive branch and the status 
of the president as a civilian 
commander in chief. Essential to 
American democracy is the idea 
that the military reports to us.

Today, I cannot even write an 

article questioning an increase 
in defense spending without 
feeling as if I need to include 
a 
paragraph 
qualifying 
my 

respect for the troops. Hawkish 
politicians funnel money into the 
armed services at historic levels, 
nearly without a second thought. 
Our military is romanticized, 
idealized and elevated to the 
point that its entitlement to 
nearly 20 percent of the national 
budget is a given and to question it 
would be considered unpatriotic. 
The Senate just approved more 
money for military action its 
members don’t even know is 
taking place. That skepticism is 
gone. We need it back.

From speed to grit: Michigan 
switches up its offensive style

At the outset of the season 

less than a month ago, one 
would think that the Michigan 
hockey team would be a fast-
paced scoring team after a 10-1 
drubbing of Western Ontario. 
After four games, though, the 
Wolverines are shaping up to 
be the opposite: a hard-nosed 
team that wears its opponents 
down over the course of entire 
games. 

“We’re trying to play with 

more pace in practice so when 
we get in the game it will seem 
easier,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson before that game. 
“Not that it will be, but mainly 
just the pace and attention to 
detail.”

Michigan (3-1) opened its 

season with the goal of being 
a quick, high-intensity team. 
It either hasn’t achieved that 
aim yet, or its playing style is 
transforming into something 
different.

This season, the Wolverines 

have combined for 131 shots 
and allowed just 89 thus far, 
consistently putting incredible 
pressure on their opponents. In 
terms of first-period scoring, 
however, they have combined 

for just two goals.

While some may view this 

as something to work on, fans 
may have to come to grips with 
the fact that this may not be the 
flashiest season of hockey they 
will see. What Michigan does 
promise, though, is a certain 
level of consistent intensity that 
will grab wins, even if it’s only 
by a small margin.

“I liked the way our team 

stayed with it,” 
Pearson 
said 

Tuesday 
on 

WTKA. “ … They 
stayed with it 
and you could 
see that at the 
start of the third 
period, which I 
thought was our 
best period on 
Saturday. 
And 

our team hung 
in there, they 
stayed with the game plan.

“That’s one of the things 

we’ve 
been 
preaching 
is, 

regardless of the situation, 
whether we’re up by five goals, 
down by a goal — whatever it 
might be — first period, second 
period, is to continue to play the 
game.”

Freshman 
forward 
Josh 

Norris 
reinforced 
that 

sentiment after this weekend’s 
matchups 
against 
Vermont 

(2-4). 
Following 
a 
missed 

penalty shot Friday, Norris 
ended up scoring two goals.

Perhaps a true testament 

to 
the 
Wolverines’ 
playing 

style, even with those missed 
chances, there continues to be 
zero hesitation to chip away at 
the opposing defense.

“Yeah, 
it’s 
definitely 

frustrating,” 
Norris said on 
Friday. “I think 
anytime 
like 

that, you want 
to 
help 
your 

team out, but 
you kind of have 
to refocus and 
see 
what 
lies 

ahead.”

Ultimately, 

it’s still early in 
the season and 

there is plenty more to see from 
the Michigan offense. However, 
it is increasingly likely that 
this will be a team that grinds 
out games to the final whistle 
rather than burning up early.

Entering 
conference 
play 

this weekend against Penn 
State (1-1 Big Ten, 3-3), though, 
which style is preferable is yet 
to be determined.

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily

The Michigan hockey team has already showcased multiple styles of play in the first four games of its season.

‘M’ keeps rolling with shutout win

On Senior Night in Ann Arbor, 

the No. 19 Michigan men’s soccer 
team took on Detroit Mercy in 
its last non-conference regular 
season matchup of the year.

The Wolverines (5-1-1 Big Ten, 

10-4-2 overall) looked to gain 
momentum heading into the late 
stages of Big Ten play against the 
Titans (6-6-3), who have only one 
win away from home. Michigan 
fought hard Wednesday night 
and earned a 1-0 victory on a 
game-winning goal by junior 
forward Francis Atuahene.

“It’s 
exciting. 
I’m 
very 

excited,” Atuahene said. “But to 
be honest, we wanted to do it for 
the seniors, for the team, and for 
the program. To be honest, all we 
wanted to do was just win.”

Despite their eventual victory, 

the game did not begin the way 
the Wolverines had envisioned. 
Just a minute into the match, 
a Titans’ corner caused panic 
inside the box, resulting in a shot 
for Detroit Mercy that sailed just 
over the crossbar. But Michigan 
worked its way back into the 
game and dominated the rest of 
the half.

The 
Wolverines’ 
constant 

pressure 
made 

it difficult for 
the Titans to get 
out of their own 
half of the field. 
But 
Michigan 

registered 
just 

two 
shots 
in 

the 
first 
25 

minutes, 
both 

of which were 
sent 
wide 
by 

the Wolverines’ 
forwards.

Michigan ended the half with 

six shots but was unsuccessful in 
converting on its chances. The 
Wolverines headed to the locker 
room tied, 0-0, with the Titans.

At the beginning of the second 

half, Detroit Mercy orchestrated 
a well-placed cross from the right 
side of the Michigan 18-yard 

box that was taken on the half-
volley from Titans’ forward 
Aleks Vushaj, forcing a save 
from freshman goalie Henry 
Mashburn. But that would be 
the last chance of the night for 
Detroit Mercy. Defensively, the 
Titans proved impenetrable for 

Michigan. 

But that would 

change in a flash.

With 
17 

minutes 
left 

in 
the 
game, 

junior 
defender 

Marcelo Borges’ 
shot was saved 
by Detroit Mercy 
goalkeeper Josh 
Flamme, but it 
fell right into the 

path of Atuahene, whose shot 
cannoned into the net to give the 
Wolverines a 1-0 lead.

“Everybody’s 
fighting 
in 

training,” said senior defender 
Billy Stevens. “Everybody is 
fighting for each other and 
everybody’s 
got 
that 
same 

mentality in the back. Just fight 
until the game is over.”

Toward the end of the game, 

Detroit Mercy pushed players 
forward, but Michigan was able 
to hold off the attack, allowing 
only one shot on goal for the 
entire game.

This Sunday, the Wolverines 

have a chance to win the Big Ten 
regular season title in a battle 
against No. 12 Maryland.

“They’re on a three-game 

losing streak, and we’re obviously 
coming in hot,” Stevens said. “At 
the end of the day, we just have to 
keep competing and the results 
will happen.”

Added Michigan coach Chaka 

Daley: “It’s what we set out to 
do in the beginning of the year. 
… We have an opportunity to 
play for the first Big Ten regular 
season championship for men’s 
soccer on Sunday.”

After a dismal 2016 season — 

including only one conference 
win 
— 
Michigan 
has 
the 

opportunity to redeem itself and 
make history for the program.

It’s 
all 
in 
front 
of 
the 

Wolverines. They just have to 
take it.

Blend of new and old Wolverines 
shine in win over Detroit Mercy

The No. 19 Michigan men’s 

soccer team appeared to be 
crawling toward a goalless draw 
against Detroit Mercy. But when 
junior forward Francis Atuahene 
emerged from a mass of bodies 
to arrive first to a saved shot, he 
pounced on his chance to slot the 
game-winning goal past Titans’ 
goalkeeper Josh Flamme.

Four minutes later, freshman 

midfielder Umar Farouk Osman 
sliced through the defense before 
cutting back to striker Mohammed 
Zakyi, who would have doubled the 
Wolverines’ advantage if not for a 
last-ditch tackle to block his shot.

In the midst of an uninspired 

performance for what primarily 
served as a tune-up before Sunday’s 
Big Ten title decider against 
Maryland, this four-minute stretch 
exhibited the blend of experience 
and youth that has propelled 
Michigan to its most successful 
season of the Chaka Daley era.

The experience that led to 

the first goal has been on display 
throughout 
the 
season, 
and 

Wednesday night was no different. 
Two minutes into the second half, 
Detroit Mercy seemed poised to go 
up 1-0 before senior captain Billy 

Stevens appeared seemingly out 
of nowhere to make a goal-saving 
challenge.

After 
the 
match, 
Stevens’ 

teammates grabbed the defender 
— who has started every match of 
his 68-match career in Ann Arbor 
— and celebrated their victory.

“The guys tossed me up in the 

air,” Stevens said. “It’s a feeling that 
hits you so hard in the heart that 
you know everyone’s fighting for 
you.”

Added Daley: “Billy Stevens, 

Tristan Jacob, Ali Jawad, Grant 
Mattia as a fifth-year have all been 
monumental. Men of distinction 
who have been humble, hard-
working, none of them have looked 
for plaudits going forward, they’ve 
been great Michigan men.”

Atuahene discussed how the 

group inspired him in his first two 
years in Ann Arbor.

“(The seniors) have been role 

models for me,” Atuahene said. 
“Freshman year I was looking up 
to (them), especially Billy Stevens, 
who was always looking out for me. 
They set the bar high for us young 
guys and put the program in the 
position where it is now.”

The Wolverines’ upperclassmen, 

though, have only been half of the 
equation in Michigan’s renaissance 
season. Until Atuahene’s winner 

against Detroit, the team’s younger 
players — led by the team’s leading 
scorer, Zakyi, and leading passer, 
sophomore 
midfielder 
Jack 

Hallahan — had either scored 
or assisted their last 16 goals, 
dating back to a Sept. 8 win over 
Wisconsin.

“(The freshmen) are great in the 

locker room and also on the training 
field, they’re coming in every 
day 100 percent,” Stevens said. 
“Strong tackles, sharp passing, it’s 
incredible. We have a true number 
six, a true number nine, and (both 
our wingers), these guys coming in 
just playing phenomenal.”

It is not just coach-speak, 

either. As Stevens stood on the 
field postgame, an attendant 
cracked the door to the locker 
room open behind him. In the 
split second it was open, the sound 
of celebratory cheers and music 
spilled from the jubilant locker 
room onto the field.

Michigan’s rejuvenating journey 

does not seem to be ending anytime 
soon. Sunday, the Wolverines will 
play for their first-ever conference 
title in College Park, home of one of 
the sport’s traditional powerhouses 
in No. 12 Maryland. While this may 
come as a surprise to most who 
followed Michigan’s eighth-place 
conference finish last season, it 
hasn’t to Daley.

“In our first meeting of the 

year on August 8, we talked to the 
guys and we asked them ‘Where 
do you want to be?’,” Daley said. 
“And they wanted to be in the 
NCAA tournament and to compete 
for a Big Ten championship. (It) 
made life very easy for me to have 
a motivated group and a united 
group, and I think that’s the biggest 
thing.”

This unity ultimately comes 

back to Stevens and the rest of the 
senior class, who have taken their 
experience of three losing seasons 
to ensure that their talented 
freshman classmates would not 
endure the same struggle.

“The biggest thing the seniors 

have done for the freshman class,” 
Daley said, “is helping them 
understand that it’s hard to win 
college soccer games.”

Running backs carry the load for Michigan

After watching No. 2 Penn 

State’s running back — and 
Heisman 
Trophy 
contender 

— Saquon Barkley run right 
through 
Michigan’s 
then-top-

ranked defense to the tune of 
108 yards and two touchdowns, 
the Wolverines could have been 
swayed by the idea that one 
tailback is better than three.

In Michigan’s ground game, 

junior Karan Higdon, sophomore 
Chris Evans and fifth-year senior 
Ty Isaac all have a role to play. 
And as far as the Wolverines are 
concerned, they wouldn’t have it 
any other way.

It 
may 
have 
taken 
two 

players, but Michigan’s backfield 
managed to match Barkley’s 
performance with 103 yards and 
a pair of touchdowns of their 
own Saturday. They were the 
Wolverines’ only scores on the 
night.

Ever since redshirt junior 

quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight’s 

injury, reliance on rushing has 
become a common theme for 
Michigan. While the passing 
game has taken a sizable hit, the 
running game has emerged to 
take its place. 

“As a whole, we have to adapt 

and do what we’re capable of 
doing at a high level,” said running 
backs coach Jay Harbaugh. “… I 
think that’s in our nature because 
we’re built to do a lot of different 
things. So whether it’s run-heavy 
or pass-heavy, it’s just going to be 
week-by-week. And as the season 
goes, it just unfolds based on 
how certain position groups are 
playing.”

Some units may not have 

been ready to make that leap, 
but the Wolverines’ trio of backs 
have taken it upon themselves 
to dictate the direction of the 
offense. Each of them has put 
forth 
standout 
performances, 

from Isaac against Cincinnati to 
Evans against Purdue to Higdon 
against Indiana.

Higdon had the best outing of 

the bunch, posting a 200-yard, 
three-touchdown 
day 
which 

included a 59-yard score that 
could — and should — have iced 
the game against the Hoosiers. 
The burst through the middle 
displayed the techniques that 
Michigan has attempted to instill 
in its rotational backs.

“When 
a 
run 
is 
blocked 

properly, there should be one 
guy or two guys left unblocked 
that could potentially make the 
play,” Harbaugh said. “… The 
two safeties were unblocked, and 
Karan had the speed to split them 
right down the middle. That’s the 
kind of thing that your running 
has to take care of those extra one 
or two guys.”

Though Higdon has claimed 

the starting spot, Evans and 
Isaac still factor heavily in the 
Wolverines’ scheme. The matter 
of splitting carries can be tricky, 
but Michigan has formulated a 
method that works for it.

Harbaugh 
designs 
certain 

plays specifically for each of the 
three based on their particular 
strengths. In many cases, Isaac 
rushes behind the offensive line 
with his strength, Evans rushes 
to the outside with his speed and 
Hidgon rushes through the gaps 
with his power.

Their 
running 
ability 
is 

certainly 
important, 
but 
to 

Harbaugh, so is their blocking 
ability. In order to gain more 
playing time, it is necessary to 
possess both to be a complete 
back.

“You’re 
looking 
for 
just 

reliability 
assignment-wise, 

for one,” he said. “Running the 
plays the way they’re supposed 
to be run. Reading the runs the 
proper way. And pass protection-
wise, 
understanding 
where 

the protection is going, who 
they’re responsible for and then 
executing the physical part of the 
block. It’s not necessarily like, 
‘Hey, this guy practiced the best, 
so he’s going to play the most’ … 
(It’s) ‘let’s figure out a way to put 
them in situations where they can 
succeed.’

“… As the season has gone on, 

certain guys have emerged as 
being more reliable or trustworthy 
on third down, as protection backs 
or as receiving backs.”

Since 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback John O’Korn took 
over under center, pass protection 
has also been a major point of 
emphasis. While a large degree of 
that responsibility belongs on the 
shoulders of the offensive line, the 
running backs have obligations 
there as well.

In the Wolverines’ two losses, 

the highly-ranked defenses of 
No. 16 Michigan State and Penn 
State made that task harder than 
Michigan could handle. O’Korn 
was sacked four and seven times, 
respectively, 
which 
showed 

Harbaugh that there is still a long 
way to go in that phase of the 
game.

“We’re 
really 
chasing 

perfection, 
where 
we 
can 

stack 
game-after-game 
where 

the quarterback isn’t getting 
touched,” he said. “… We gotta 

continue to grow in terms of 
being disciplined with our eyes 
and being 100 percent perfect 
with 
assignments. 
The 
guys 

understand 
that 
that’s 
what 

the standard is and (we’re) just 
grinding at that every single day.

“Will you ever get there? 

Maybe, maybe not. But if you can 
get really close to it, and keep the 
quarterback clean, you’re going to 
be pretty good as an offense.”

Harbaugh is the first to admit 

that there is still room to grow for 
his unit, but it has been trending 
upward. Now, Michigan needs it 
to carry the load.

And that’s an encouraging sign 

for the first-time running backs 
coach.

“They work hard, they take a 

lot of pride in what they do, they 
really, really want to win and they 
approach a pretty selfish position 
unselfishly, and that’s huge,” 
Harbaugh said. “It makes it fun 
to have everyone be together and 
work together, and it gives you a 
better chance for success.”

‘M’ depends on youth

The Michigan basketball team 

will have eight new faces on the 
court this season. Five of them are 
freshmen, two are transfers, and 
it’s no secret that many of them 
will be expected to contribute at a 
high level. 

Wednesday, though, Michigan 

coach John Beilein started the 
team’s media day by outlining the 
problems presented by a young 
team.

“Now, the young kids are 

always the same. It’s always 
fundamentals, 
fundamentals,” 

Beilein said. “I’m talking about 
things that aren’t changing. I 
change like the wind in basketball. 
Are you in a stance? Are you 
talking? Are you catching the ball 
with two hands, two feet? Are 
you embracing physicality? That’s 
never gonna change. And getting 
the new guys to do that has been a 
bit of a challenge so far.”

For a few of the most recent 

additions, 
acclimating 
to 
the 

program is nothing new.

Junior 

guard 
Charles 

Matthews 
and 

sophomore center 
Austin 
Davis 

each 
redshirted 

last 
season, 

giving them an 
opportunity 
to 

focus 
on 
self-

improvement. 
According 
to 

Beilein, they took 
advantage of it.

“Especially on the scout team, 

they’re not as accountable. We’re 
watching the other guys.” Beilein 
said. “So, there’s Charles and 
Austin (that) could make big 
improvements, where they showed 
great flashes of talent last year.”

For the incoming freshmen, it’s 

a different story. Without a chance 
to go through drills last season, 
they are being thrown into the 
proverbial fire and will be expected 
to make the necessary adjustments 

to play collegiate basketball.

It’s hard to say how noteworthy 

this inexperience may be, as 
college basketball is known for 
young teams that perform at a 
high level. But to ease any potential 
issues the Wolverines may see, 
some of the more experienced 
players have taken matters into 
their own hands.

“That’s a part of the excitement 

and energy,” said fifth-year senior 
forward 
Duncan 
Robinson. 

“We’ve got so many guys who 
haven’t been through it before. 
Day-to-day, we’re learning new 
things about ourselves and each 
other, just trying to make the most 
and learn from the mistakes and 
the successes. It puts pressure on 
the guys who have been through it 
before to pick up where guys might 
lack in experience.”

Added junior forward Moritz 

Wagner: “That’s the beautiful 
thing about this offense: that when 
you play it, everybody has the same 
amount of chance to finish. I think 
it’s more on (the older players) to 
give the other players a chance to 
learn it and to communicate it and 

to teach it a little 
more, because it 
can’t only be the 
coach to teach 
that offense. It’s 
gotta be all of us, 
and 
especially 

the 
guys 
that 

are a little more 
experienced.”

It’s a challenge 

Beilein 
hasn’t 

encountered 

recently, and if his opening 
statements on Wednesday are 
any indication, it’s one he isn’t 
taking lightly. For the Wolverines 
themselves, though, it may be more 
about patience than anything.

“No team starts off at their 

peak offensively,” Matthews said. 
“Even like the NBA, like the Cavs 
right now. Everybody has to get 
familiar with one another. As we 
continue to play with one another, 
each and every one of us is going to 
be comfortable with each other.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Wolverines and Scarlet Knights 
share similar offensive strategy 

Michigan fans may not like 

to hear this, but the Wolverines’ 
offense isn’t that much different 
than Rutgers’. 

Each team’s passing game is 

practically non-existent, so both 
have been relying on the ground 
game to carry the offense.

Michigan (2-2 Big Ten, 5-2 

overall) 
has 
had 
quarterback 

problems since Wilton Speight 
went down with an injury. Fifth-
year senior quarterback John 
O’Korn hasn’t been as reliable, 
and he threw for a total of just 224 
yards in his last two games with a 
54 percent completion rate.

His 
counterpart, 
Rutgers 

quarterback Giovanni Rescigno, 
has thrown for just 176 yards and 
completed 50 percent of his throws 
in his last two games against 
Illinois and Purdue.

Regardless of the comparisons, 

neither team’s passing games 
are producing. Those struggles 
have kept Michigan out of playoff 
contention and kept Rutgers from 
even competing in the Big Ten.

That’s why both sides lean on 

their tailbacks.

The Wolverines ran the ball on 

64 percent of their plays against 
Indiana and Penn State. Rutgers 
was even more one dimensional in 
its last two games, running the ball 
73 percent of the time.

While the level of talent might 

differ, the strategies have been the 
same: Run. Run. Pass if needed. 
And then run more.

From a defensive perspective, 

that 
means 
the 
Wolverines’ 

linebackers can expect a bigger 
role.

“I relish any time you can have 

linebackers 
and 
guys 
playing 

downhill and tackling and hitting 
the football,” said linebackers 
coach Chris Partridge. “It’s a 
challenge now. We need to make 
sure we stop the run, because their 
running game is going to open up 
the pass.

“… It’s a challenge to stop their 

running game for sure. Their 
running backs are pretty good 
now. They’re downhill. They’re 
physical. We need to make sure we 
tackle and match their violence and 
intensity.”

Partridge 
complimented 

Rutgers’ 
group 
of 
tailbacks 

Wednesday. Similar to Michigan 
— again — the Scarlet Knights have 
three players who contribute most 
at the position.

Gus Edwards leads Rutgers 

with 487 yards and five rushing 
touchdowns, and splitting downs 
behind him are Robert Martin at 
278 yards and two touchdowns and 
Raheem Blackshear at 216 yards 
and three touchdowns.

Rushing defense duties fall 

mostly on Michigan’s linebackers: 
sophomore Devin Bush, sophomore 
Khaleke Hudson and fifth-year 
senior Mike McCray. The pair of 
sophomores are two of Michigan’s 
fastest defensive players, and it 
will be up to them to stuff the box 
when Rutgers runs up the middle 
and race to the sidelines when the 
Scarlet Knights try to beat them on 
the edge.

They’ll also have to spy on 

Rescigno. 
While 
he’s 
been 

ineffective connecting with his 
receivers, the Michigan native 
poses a threat as a runner as well. 
Rescigno took over the starting job 
at Rutgers a few weeks ago after 
Kyle Bolin threw for just 56 yards 
against Ohio State.

“(Rescigno has) got some legs, 

and he can run a little bit,” Partridge 
said. “I know he’s a Michigan guy, 
so he’s going to be all fired up to 
come here and play here.”

If Rescigno decides to take 

off on the run, Bush and Hudson 
will have to chase him, but when 
he stays in the pocket, it’s on 
Michigan’s defensive line to keep 
him contained.

New Jersey native Rashan Gary 

— like the rest of teammates — has 
been watching film of Rutgers this 
week. The sophomore defensive 
end also said that nothing in 
particular stood out because of how 
much it mirrors the Wolverines’ 
offense.

“It’s an offense that we see 

almost every day in practice,” Gary 
said. “It’s kind of similar to it, not 
much that we see differently.”

Rutgers may be a different 

opponent, but its offense has a 
familiar feel. That should put 
Michigan at an advantage heading 
into this weekend.

Michigan testing new frontcourt

With junior Moritz Wagner 

locked in as the de facto starter 
at center, it’s “Bull” versus “Big 
Nasty” for the backup ‘5’ spot on 
the Michigan basketball team.

Well, at least according to 

assistant coach Saddi Washington.

The two nicknames designated 

by the second-year coach are for 
redshirt freshman Austin Davis 
and 
sophomore 

Jon 
Teske, 

respectively. 
This year, both 
of 
them 
will 

look to “embrace 
that 
nastiness” 

and 
increase 

their roles from 
last 
season, 
in 

which 
Teske 

played 
sparsely 

— often looking 
uncomfortable on the court — and 
Davis redshirted.

The loss of DJ Wilson to the 

NBA has created flexibility in the 
frontcourt that wasn’t needed 
much last year — the Wolverines 
used just two different starting 
lineups in 2016-17. While Wagner 
might be taking tip-offs now, he 
and fifth-year senior Duncan 
Robinson offer serious defensive 
question 
marks 
that 
make 

production from Davis and Teske 
a necessity. For Michigan coach 
John Beilein, picking a definitive 
winner just nine days before the 
Wolverines’ first exhibition match 
has been hard to do.

“I would say right now that Jon 

Teske has probably been better 
than (Davis) at this point,” Beilein 
said at the team’s media day on 
Wednesday. “(Davis is) a guy 
whose body has really changed. 
… When he gets to 212 degrees 
— and he’s boiling — he’s gonna 
be really good, but he’s gotta get 
there first.”

Added 
Davis: 
“(Beilein’s) 

expecting a lot from me this year. 
I know that there’s a big role to fill 
and minutes to play so I’m looking 
forward to going out and working 
hard to earn those minutes. … I’ve 
worked hard in the weight room 
being able to move quicker. I feel 
much more comfortable running.”

When Wagner, Teske or Davis 

do see time at center, it’s primarily 
up to Robinson and freshman 
Isaiah Livers to fill the stretch-
four void left by Wilson.

For the 6-foot-8 Robinson, 

who can space the floor with 
his offensive prowess, he has 
challenged himself to fulfill the 
defensive improvements expected 
of him in his final year.

“Adapting to (assistant coach 

Luke) Yaklich’s defensive system, 

just schematically 
how he likes to 
play. ... I feel like 
I’ve made strides 
in 
that 
area,” 

Robinson 
said. 

“He’s been great 
with helping me 
guard the ball, 
moving my legs, 
being in the right 
place at the right 
time.”

While Robinson is an elite 

outside shooting threat, his smaller 
frame makes it difficult for him to 
replicate the two-way production 
that warranted Wilson’s selection 
as the No. 17 pick in the draft. A 
by-committee approach will be 
needed to accomplish such a tall 
order. And that’s where Livers 
comes in.

Michigan’s 2017 Mr. Basketball 

may have the earliest opportunity 
to see playing time amongst the 
three 
highly-touted 
freshmen, 

a 
product 
of 
a 
thinned-out 

frontcourt. Livers is listed two 
inches shorter than Wilson, but 
displays athleticism resemblant of 
the now-Milwaukee Buck. Livers 
already possesses the offensive 
chops to succeed at the college 
level, but according to the young 
player himself, Beilein has almost 
exclusively stressed defense to the 
freshman.

“Everybody wants to score but 

I take it as ‘Hey, a Hall of Fame 
coach is asking me to take a role,’ 
” Livers said. “I’m gonna take that 
role to be a better player, I know he 
knows what he’s talking about.

“From watching that (Oregon) 

game last year, I really loved that 
team. You remember that free 
throw when (Wilson) shot it and 
got his own rebound? It just made 
me think ‘Dang, I already know 
what coach (Beilein)’s gonna tell 
me next year.’ ”

The 
frontcourt 
concerns 

compose only one of a litany of 
issues facing Michigan in the 
2017-18 season, but if this team is 
anything like Beilein’s previous 10, 
the kinks will be ironed out with 
time.

The modern paganism of AA: Defining a new normal

Daily Arts Writer Sam Lu profiles local paganism and its practitioners, providing an intimate look at the oft-enigmatic faith

There’s no doubt that the 

world has a lot of conflicting 
opinions 
about 
Paganism. 

Some believe that the term is 
synonymous with witchcraft, 
while others simply equate it 
with full on Satanism. Recently, 
Kathleen 
Hartnett 
White, 

President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

nominee for senior White House 
adviser 
for 
environmental 

policy, likened global warming 
to a form of Paganism for 
secular elites. People — and 
the Bible — will even use 
“Pagan” to describe ideologies 
contrary to the historically 
dominant 
Christian 
tenants 

that have shaped American 
history. Misunderstandings are 
usually the major obstacles that 
prevent 
mainstream 
society 

from accepting Paganism as a 
religion.

Modern 
Paganism 
covers 

a 
broad 
swathe 
of 
beliefs, 

practices 
and 
ideologies; 

the 
International 
Pagan 

Federation’s 
website 
defines 

Paganism as “the ancestral 
religion 
of 
the 
whole 
of 

humanity.” According to the 
site, 
most 
Pagan 
religions 

emphasize 
the 
same 
three 

basic concepts: veneration of 
nature, polytheism and the 
“feminine face of divinity.” 
There 
are 
many 
different 

subsets 
of 
Pagan 
religions, 

including but not limited to 
Heathenry, 
Shamanism 
and 

Hellenism. 
Heathenry, 
is 
a 

polytheistic belief system that 
is centered upon the Norse 
gods, 
among 
other 
beings. 

Heathen values include wyrd, 
a 
multidimensional 
force 

that 
connects 
everything 

in 
the 
universe, 
fridh, 
or 

the 
importance 
of 
keeping 

intergroup 
relationships 

peaceful 
and 
honesty. 

Shamanism 
originated 
from 

the 
religious 
practices 
of 

Native American cultures while 
Hellenism honors ancient Greek 
gods.

Although Paganism is far 

from being as pervasive as 
Christianity is, the population 
of religious Pagan practitioners 
has blossomed in recent years, 
especially with the rise of social 
media; organizations exist as 
far away as Iran and as close as 
Ann Arbor.

***
For the Rev. Rob Henderson, 

senior druid of Shining Lakes 
Grove in Ann Arbor, Paganism is 
all about what links people to one 
another and to the world around 
them: “Ultimately, I would say 
that it’s acknowledging your 
connection to various entities 
and forces around the universe 
and using them to the benefit of 
everyone,” Henderson said in a 
phone interview.

Out of all the modern Pagan 

— or Neopagan — organizations 
that exist, Henderson’s church, 
Ár nDraíocht Féin, or “A Druid 
Fellowship” 
is 
one 
of 
the 

largest and most public. The 
organization can be thought of 
as more of an umbrella group 
for congregation rather than a 
typical church, and currently 
has about 60 groups spread all 
over the world. ADF, which 
means “Our own Druidism” 
in Irish, was founded by Isaac 
Bonewits in 1983 with the 
intention 
of 
“creat(ing) 
an 

authentically Druidic Neopagan 
religion our ancestors would 
be 
proud 
of.” 
Today, 
that 

takes shape through a focus 
on 
acceptance, 
respect 
and 

positivity. ADF’s beliefs touch 
on everything from the ethics 
and neutrality of science and 
technology to the presence of an 

afterlife.

“Polytheism 
is 
a 
really 

tolerant and open thing. If 
you’re 
acknowledging 
that 

other people also have gods, our 
way is more ‘My way is right 
and your way is probably also 
right,’” Henderson said.

Henderson first joined the 

Pagan 
community 
in 
1990, 

when he was a student at 
the University of Michigan. 
Growing up, he was raised 
Catholic, but his family left the 
church before Henderson took 
communion and he spent much 
of his teenage years as a radical 
atheist. However, he’d always 
had a spiritual connection to 
Paganism, even before he’d 
“officially” 
discovered 
the 

practice.

“Back when I was a child, 

I remembered hearing voices 
in my head that claimed to be 
the goddess Athena — I wasn’t 
particularly keen on sharing 
those with people around me 
for a while. In college I had a 
few friends who were involved 
with Paganism, and I figured, 
with my connection to Athena, 
why not?” Henderson said.

Along with all the belief 

differences 
that 
separate 

Paganism and more ubiquitous 
monotheist 
religions, 
Pagan 

practitioners also use different 

terms for members of different 
standings. The term druid has 
Celtic origins: Originally, the 
term came from the Welsh word 
for oak, and loosely translated 
means “person of the oak.” Back 
then, it referred to the priestly 
class of Celtic people, but 
nowadays it’s used in a much 
more general way.

“The problem is that people 

will point out, why are you using 
a Celtic word? Simply because 
it’s the best word. Even though 
we aren’t specifically a Celtic 
organization, ADF has a lot of 
European members. There was 
some talk of calling us Teuts, 
which means ‘people of the 
people,’ but I was not going to 
call myself a Teut,” Henderson 
said. “Another problem is that 
druid only technically refers to 
priests, and only 10 percent of 
organization is really priests, so 
the more accurate term might 
be ADF practitioner.”

In the almost 30 years of 

his journey with Paganism, 
Henderson 
has 
seen 
the 

movement change irrevocably, 
mainly as a result of the 
proliferation 
of 
technology 

and widespread usage of the 
internet. Most obviously, it’s a lot 
easier to share ideas with others 
— some who practice Paganism 
even participate in Facebook 
rituals, which Henderson isn’t 
a proponent of, as it lacks the 
energy and interconnectedness 
that physically being in a group 
can provide.

“Back when I first got started 

with it, it involved going to 
Borders and getting magazines. 
If you could afford to travel, 
you went to festivals around 
the country. Otherwise, you’d 
share books and ideas at group 
meetings, then go home to do 
things on your own,” Henderson 
said.

Like 
most 
who 
practice 

Paganism and alternative forms 
of religion, Henderson has had 
his fair share of dealing with 
nonbelievers, including those 
that write Paganism off as 
Satanic worship.

“I’ve given up arguing with 

those people. If that’s what 
you believe, then there’s really 
no point in me trying to argue 
against it,” Henderson said. 
“There’s sometimes this idea 
that we’re going against what 
other people are like just to be 
counterculture or different, but 
it’s not like that at all. We’re 
doing this for ourselves, to make 
a better world, not to annoy 
other people.”

Despite his devout beliefs, 

Henderson 
acknowledges 

Paganism 
may 
not 
be 
the 

path for every or even most 
individuals.

“There are other ways to feel 

connected to the universe and to 
other people, and I know plenty 
of atheists and monotheists who 
do that. This is one potential 

toolset of many, it’s the one that 
works for me, and for some of 
us it’s the best one,” Henderson 
said.

***
Out of all the Pagan religions 

that exist today, witchcraft may 
be one of the most feared and 
least understood by the public. 
However, modern witchcraft 
usually bears no resemblance 
to the green-skinned, warty, 
cackling hags whom movies 
publicize.

Although 
witchcraft 
falls 

under 
the 
umbrella 
term 

Paganism, Pat Barbary, high 
priestess of MoonFire coven, 
emphasizes the clear distinction 
between the two.

“Witchcraft is very specific 

because it’s the practice of using 
your will to blend reality or to 
venerate the different gods and 
goddesses in a devotional way, 
and I think that Paganism is a 
broad term that just basically 
involves everyone who isn’t 
Christian,” Barbary said in an 
interview with The Daily. “To 
some extent, some hardcore 
Christians 
even 
feel 
that 

Catholics are Pagan.”

Like Henderson, Barbary’s 

first experiences with the Pagan 
world also started when she was 
young, in the form of a feeling of 
unfulfillment that she couldn’t 
quite identify.

“I was raised Catholic — I 

was very spiritual and very 
devout — but I was always 
looking for more in the church. 
Once I figured out what was 
missing, I realized I didn’t have 
the aspects of what you’re really 
doing when you’re practicing a 
ritual, because a Catholic ritual 
is very, very boring as opposed 
to a Wiccan ritual, which is 
really happy and exciting, and 
you can feel the energy and flow 
— I felt like I was coming home,” 
Barbary said.

Her 
fascination 
with 

witchcraft 
specifically 
came 

into being when she was a 
seventh grader researching the 
Salem witch trials for a report.

“I remember I was just really 

intrigued that the hysteria had 
been caused by a servant girl’s 
beliefs in spirits, and from that 
I started researching astrology 
and tarot and a number of other 
things. Eleven years old, that’s 
when I started getting into it,” 
Barbary said.

After 
college, 
Barbary 

moved to Massachusetts and 
soon became involved with 
the EarthSpirit community, a 
Neopagan group that focuses 
on venerating the earth. In 1987, 
Barbary decided to start her 
own coven, which eventually 
became 
MoonFire. 
In 
the 

most basic sense, MoonFire 
follows 
British 
traditional 

Alexandrian Wicca, which was 
founded by Alex Sanders in the 
mid- to late-1900s. Similar to 
Paganism itself, Wicca contains 

several subsets of more specific 
ideologies 
and 
practices; 

Alexandrian Wicca is distinct 
from other types of Wicca, 
such as Dianic Wicca, which is 
female-oriented and goddess-
centered, 
while 
Alexandrian 

Wicca 
worships 
both 
gods 

and goddesses, and strives to 
further knowledge.

“We believe that Alexandrian 

Wicca is an evolving spiritual 
path because you can’t ignore 
all the influences around you,” 
Barbary said. “Religion is based 
on the spiritual, and there’s a lot 
of things out there that haven’t 
been explored. My belief is that 
whatever you pray for or believe 
in, those intentions all go to 
the same source and it doesn’t 
matter what religious system 
you follow.”

Outside 
of 
MoonFire, 

Barbary 
and 
her 
husband 

Paul own Artes and Craft, a 
Pagan and witchcraft store in 
Hartford, Mich. Artes and Craft 
specializes in selling handmade, 
locally crafted and sourced 
products, ranging from soaps 
and candles to spell kits and 
ritual tools, and also caters to 
a wide range of Pagan religions 
and practices.

“My favorite part of owning 

a store is probably planning the 
events — I really enjoy having 
people do that discovery thing 
where they walk in and they 
go, ‘Ooh!’ — I like being able to 
show people that there are other 
people like them around, and it’s 
growing,” Barbary said. “I think 
the Michigan area is coming of 
age, whereas I think the East 
and West Coast came of age in 
the ’80s. There’s a mainstream 
group of people that are getting 
into occult who want to learn 
and are dabbling.”

But with the bloom of new 

blood comes certain boundaries. 
Newcomers to witchcraft tend 
to underestimate the dangers 
that come with the practice, 
and after years of experience, 
Barbary has two important 
cautionary points.

“People that are involved 

with the practice really need 
to be honest with themselves; 
they need to know who they are, 
because once you’re working 
to bend reality, if you’re in 
denial about something, that 
will mess with what you’re 
doing,” Barbary said. “People 
also have to be careful with the 
term ‘harming none,’ because 
if you bend, change, alter or 
manipulate, you are not capable 
of harming none. Any time 
you’re doing a spell or even 
wishing innocently, you are 
basically 
altering 
somebody 

else’s reality to some extent.”

On top of being knowledgeable 

enough to give advice, Barbary’s 
role in the Wiccan community 
has also changed throughout 
her journey with witchcraft.

“Paul and I are a team, and 

we have found ourselves in a 
position where we are elders. 
We’re the ones bringing young 
people into the fold and saying, 
‘Yes, it’s OK to do this,’ and I feel 
like all those things I thought I 
knew when I was 20 or 30 have 
become things that I really do 
know now — it’s a nice place 
because it allows us to talk to 
people 
with 
confidence 
and 

experience,” Barbary said.

For now, change is still slow 

and 
steady. 
Witchcraft 
and 

Paganism still face significant 
sociological 
and 
cultural 

hurdles before they can be 
readily accepted by an American 
majority. Barbary, however, has 
high hopes for what is to come.

“I really do believe it’s the 

movement of the future, and I feel 
like the movement of Paganism 
is getting so widespread that it’s 
starting to feel like it’s going to 
be the next biggest ‘religious’ 
movement, and I say that in 
quotation marks because I feel 
like it’s more of a spiritual thing,” 
Barbary said.

***
Rob Henderson is equally 

optimistic 
about 
Paganism’s 

quiet 
growth, 
even 
though 

he doesn’t have full access to 
the Pagan community due to 
a disability that leaves him 
wheelchair-bound.

“There aren’t a whole lot of 

public groups in Ann Arbor these 
days — a lot of quiet groups are 
out there meeting in their own 
living rooms,” Henderson said.

When it all comes down to 

it, 
though, 
Henderson’s 
and 

Barbary’s experiences reflect an 
impression of Paganism that’s 
altogether different from the 
malevolent evil that non-Pagans 
might fear; Henderson points 
to the tolerance that Paganism 
offers, just as Barbary champions 
the positive energy that her 
rituals offer her.

“We’re 
all 
in 
the 
same 

universe, and we can at least 
help each other stay out of each 
other’s ways long enough to 
get to where we need to go,” 
Henderson said.

 CHRISTIAN KENNEDY/DAILY ARTS WRITER

It’s just a teacup...or is it?
A gem on Main Street: an 
evening at Crazy Wisdom
Local bookstore provides an alternative experience downtown

On the west side of Main Street, 

between Washington and Huron 
streets, subtly tucked between The 
Gown Shop and Vinology is a slice 
of Ann Arbor-brand heaven: Crazy 
Wisdom Bookstore & Tearoom. 
Husband and wife Bill Zirinsky 
and Ruth Schekter have owned 
Crazy Wisdom for nearly three 
decades (since 1989). After buying 
and renovating the store’s current 
building 20 years ago, today’s 
Crazy Wisdom opened in the 
spring of 1999.

Through 
the 
wood-framed 

doors, 
the 
familiar 
smell 
of 

incense lulls customers into a 
sense of comfortability as they 
browse Crazy Wisdom’s 14,000 
books, not to mention the store’s 
more spiritual offers: chakras, 
sage, candles and tarot cards. 
Despite feeling like a step-sister 
store to Portlandia’s “Feminist 
Bookstore,” Crazy Wisdom isn’t 
nearly as niche as it may sound. 
Books are organized into 160 
specialized sections pertaining to 
psychology, spirituality, holistic 
health and sustainability, but even 
these categories don’t do justice 
to the sheer range of information 
available. Whether you are making 
an edible, conjuring a spirit 
or researching a paper, Crazy 
Wisdom has books for you.

Its 14,000 books aside, Crazy 

Wisdom is so much more than 
simply a book store. As part of the 
renovations in 1999, a tea room 
was added on the second floor, 
which plays host to studying 
students, local readers and, for the 
adventurous, a regular schedule 
of psychics, tarot card readers and 
other intuitives.

“The Readers add something 

fun and interesting to the overall 
experience at Crazy Wisdom. But 
it is a small part of what we do. 
We host live music every Friday 
and Saturday evening. We have 
two Poetry Evenings a month, one 
Storytelling Night a month and we 
also rent our Community Room 

for classes, events and workshops 
over 250 times each year,” Zirinsky 
wrote in an email to The Michigan 
Daily. “We also host Fairy Teas for 
kids. And we publish the leading 
conscious 
living 
magazine 
in 

the region. Recent issues of the 
magazine have been 128 pages, 
with a glossy cover, with over 
80 advertisers, and 25 articles, 
interviews and editorial features 
per issue. We print 11,000 copies 
of the magazine, and distribute 
it all over town. It is a major 
undertaking, and we’re proud 
of the role the magazine plays in 
building community.”

The tea room serves over 100 

flavors of green, black oolong and 
herbal teas, accompanied by a 
menu of light snacks.

“We 
do 
32,000 
customer 

transactions each year in the 
bookstore and tea room,” Zirinsky 
wrote. “So, the Readers represent a 
very small part of what we do. Still, 
we love them, and value them, and 
so do many of our customers!”

The 
tea 
room’s 
intuitive 

offerings haven’t changed much 
since they began back in 1999. Four 
of Crazy Wisdom’s eight readers 
have been there, on and off, for 15 
years. Zirinsky, who has intuitive 
readings about every year or two, 
enjoys them.

“I personally like our Readers. 

They are exceptionally right-
brained. It’s like herding cats. 
That’s part of why they are good at 
what they do. They don’t think or 
process or integrate information 
the way most of the rest of us do,” 
Zirinsky wrote. “Most of them 
have had certain psychic gifts since 
childhood, and in many instances 
it was a long journey for them to 
trust their intuitive gifts, and then 
to begin to be comfortable sharing 
their often non-linear abilities with 
others.”

Crazy 
Wisdom’s 
intuitives 

charge $1.50 per minute for a 
reading, payable only in cash. 
Very occasionally, on Saturdays, 
there will be lines for a reading, 
according to Zirinsky.

“We have many, many return 

customers, who enjoy and value 
the revelations or insights they 

gain from the Readers. After all, 
our Readers are well-educated, 
and a number of them have been 
psychologists, 
teachers 
and 

therapists. They bring intuitive 
gifts, and they are most certainly 
NOT ‘fortune-tellers.’ We also 
have many people who just try it 
on a ‘lark’ and don’t necessarily 
try it again,” Zirinsky wrote. “And 
many people in the region trust 
us, and correctly assume we’ve 
vetted and approved the Intuitives 
and Psychics who work at Crazy 
Wisdom, and so they expect 
that our Readers will be sincere, 
thoughtful and ‘legitimate’ rather 
than ‘fortune tellers.’”

This 
Halloweek’s 
weather 

has been ideal for staying in and 
watching scary movies. It wasn’t 
ideal for walking to Main Street 
on a mission to get my cards read, 
but alas, my deadline is looming 
and I’m eager enough to muster 
the energy required to put on 
jeans, boots and a raincoat to make 
the six-block journey to Crazy 
Wisdom.

And in a short ten minutes the 

warm, cozy solace of my bed is 
exchanged for the equally warm 
and cozy solace of Crazy Wisdom. 
After scanning the seemingly 
endless shelves of books and a 
few cases of crystals, I make my 
way upstairs to the tea room. The 
bookstore was quiet in comparison 
to the street and while the tea room 
didn’t get quieter, the air felt still: 
no one working at the bar, a sign 
signaled they’d be back shortly, and 
a handful of people working and 
reading silently in the sitting area.

After failing to locate the tarot 

card reader in the tea room, I 
accept the idea I misread the 
schedule and head back to the first 
floor to peruse for anything that 
might be helpful in the seance I’m 
hosting later tonight.

Crazy Wisdom’s first floor 

is similar to a railroad-style 
apartment — it continues back 
further than expected. So much so 
that after working my way toward 
the back, collecting a small bag 
of protective sea salt and a blue 
candle that eases communications

B-SIDE SECONDARY

between the mortal and immortal 
worlds, I spot a sign hanging 
by the emergency exit ushering 
customers into the store’s farthest-
back nook for intuitive readings.

As I approach, I see a woman 

is already seated having her cards 
read, so I break off to the side, 
and from behind a shelf I listen 
momentarily to her reading. It feels 
so personal, but from the other 
side of the shelf, my eavesdropping 
feels especially invasive. With 
the thought that the reader could 
possibly feel my presence on the 
other side of the shelf, I usher 
myself away and linger in the dark 
magic section while I wait for my 
turn.

Sitting in a corner, reading up on 

best practices to conjure a demon, 
I spot the brunette from the nook 
heading out, taking another sip 
of her boxed water. Luckily, the 
reader, Kathy Bloch, has time for 
one more.

***
Ten minutes. Fifteen dollars. 

Three cards: one for my recent 
past, one for my present, one for the 
near future.

From someone who genuinely 

enjoys readings (psychic, card, 
aura, etc.), I wasn’t feeling the 
idea of having my past, present 
and future laid out in front of me 
this particular day; I was saving 
that for my therapy appointment 
on Thursday. Additionally, being 
in the presence of an intuitive is 
less daunting when you carry the 
cynicism of a nonbeliever, but for 
me, sitting across from a reader is 
intimidating as I try to keep my 
self-awareness on pace with their 
worldly awareness.

The 
typical 
archetype 
of 

individuals who receive readings is 
someone who leaps onto a reader’s 
grand, general statements and 
offers specific details about how 
a statement applies to their life, 
effectively giving readers more 
information to customize their 
reading, thus forming a type of self-
fulfilling prophecy. But for those 

rolling their eyes at home, if they’ve 
made it this far, I kept my side of 
our conversation to nods, chuckles 
and an occasional yes.

Bloch had no trouble filling 

up the entirety of my 10 minutes 
with energetic, logical and, above 
all, applicable reading of the three 
cards I pulled from her deck. Her 
ending note conveyed the overall 
idea of her readings: “Stay with the 
boat and all will be provided.”

Bloch has been reading at Crazy 

Wisdom for two years, but it’s not 
her first time working as a reader. 
Having studied the cards since 
1980, she began doing readings in 
1995. Originally reading at Crazy 
Wisdom years ago, she took a 
break after her brother died of 
cancer only to come back after an 
accidental run-in with Zirinsky.

“When one of our Readers tunes 

in well, I believe the customer can 
gain a few thought-provoking and 
meaningful insights into one’s life 
and relationships,” Zirinsky wrote.

I’d have to agree.

Fortunes are one of many eclectic offerings found at Crazy Wisdom.

A Ouija board seance

in this series, three daily arts writers in 

varying states of mind visit the same 

place and write about their experiences.

baked.buzzed.board.

this week’s destination:

a friend of mine at one point took too big of a bong hit and felt like she ceased 

to exist for a moment. I had never experienced that feeling until I tried dabs. 

And now I love dabs, and also casual witchery, which has led us to now. 

There’s several daily arts members enshrined in a circle of protec-

tive sea salt ready to contact a spirit (hopefully a demon).

I did multiple dabs prior so even if we don’t make 

contact, the sensory experience of the dark base-

ment alone is a thrill in and of itself. 

....

we added a new candle, my 

almost used lavender one bc 

it “attracts vampires” according 

to our Supreme, Madeleine. My arm is 

fucking tired, but the thing is moving so im 

trying really hard to keep it light, you know. 

I like moments like this because I can contain the 

yearning for the afterlife and knowledge of it and the van-

ity to sell my soul to live forever at the same time. What life is 

all about, you know. I got the chills a few times, if that means any-

thing. I thought about my dead dog. And my dead aunt. The aunt could 

actually make a feasible demon tbh. Oh god I’m going to hell

Someone remind me to wash the pentagram carved out of meijer-brand tums 

in the morning... 

—DAILY ARTS WRITER

I like to joke that I’m a witch. I saw “The Craft” one too 

many times as a kid and my Smiths phase was (is) unnatu-
rally long. I rolled up tonight in an ankle-length black coat, 
two (or three, maybe four) beers and a desire to conjure a 
spirit.

The first two tries weren’t fruitful, so I turned to the 

good old Google and found that Vampires are attracted to 
lavender. So we drew a pentagram on the floor with a Tums 
and lit another calendar and actually did the damn thing.

My good pal Q asked for our blood in exchange for 

revenge against one of our most mortal enemies, which was 
cool. The whole process of moving the heart around the 
board was fun, but I’m just really proud of myself.

Bored is proud of me too (hell ya!). This is method acting 

I think. Or method living (haha get it). I’m pretty convinced 
at this point that I can raise the dead and change the weath-
er and whatever else witches do. Scare men and babies and 
country club moms.

That’s pretty cool. I’m going to go home and light some 

candles and cast some spells. And probably rewatch “The 
Craft.” And hex my ex. And get a cat

—DAILY ARTS WRITER

Baked, Buzzed, me, and five other friends gathered for the occasion. 

The $20 Toys-R-Us Ouija Board was placed on the basement floor with 
two candles and “protective salt”.

I’ve done Ouija board in the past. My high school friends and I 
would gather around my dining room table of my house with my 

mom’s Ouija board (when you use an older Ouija board that’s 

when you know it’s going to be good). We would channel 

some spirits, mostly good ones, and afterwards we’d laugh 
at how silly it was.

That’s the fun thing about Ouija boards: it’s all about 

how much you want to believe in it. And if you can 
trust your friends not to cheat.

I began our session as the summoner. It took us a 

few tries to get all our giggles out, but once it began, 
we all got serious. Soon enough I learned that I suck 
at summoning spirits. Due to no movement on the 
board whatsoever, I gave up and let Buzzed take over.

We silently listened to Buzzed ask their questions 

to the spirit world, and we encountered a vampire 
spirit named “Q” after we drew a fucking pentagram 
under the board. “Fuck, I’ve never gotten this far,” said 
Baked. 

We asked the demon to come to the mortal world and 

get some revenge on those who have wronged us. We asked 

what it wanted in return, and the spirit spelled out “BLOOD” 

on the board. There may or may not have been some blood shed 

from the group members –– so yeah, shit got weird.
I’m so proud of Buzzed for channeling their inner witch. Could it 

have been an evil vampire spirit that came to us? Maybe. Was it Matt 
Gallatin or Anay who rigged the whole thing? Absolutely.

COURTESY OF NAOMI WAKU

One of many elaborate looks at the hands of Naomi Waku, better known online as ‘NamGlam’

Artist Naomi Waku puts 
the glamor in Halloween

NamGlam intersects the elaborate & the glamorous in her tutorials

In the age of lip kits, contour 

and ever-thickening eyebrows, 
it seems that everyone wants to 
be a makeup mogul. Instagram 
and YouTube have made it so 
anyone can throw their looks 
or tutorials to the masses, 
gaining online prestige and 
setting the bar for upcoming 
trends. But succeeding in the 
makeup world is easier said 
than done.

Born and raised in Belgium, 

24-year-old Naomi Waku is 
one such success 
story; a success 
story 
that 
has 

taken 
on 
the 

unconventional. 
As NamGlam on 
Instagram, Waku 
creates theatrical, 
transformative 
looks. 
She 
has 

made 
herself 

into 
an 
alien 

fortune teller, an 
avatar 
princess, 

a glam red devil 
and 
a 
wicked 

witch; all using 
makeup. In just 
over a year, Waku 
has 
amassed 

52 
thousand 

Instagram 
followers and has 
recently 
started 

posting tutorials 
to YouTube. 

“Ever since I 

can 
remember 

I 
always 
loved 

fashion 
and 

beauty. 
In 
my 

teenage 
years, 

I 
came 
across 

beauty channels 
on Youtube and I instantly 
fell in love,” Waku wrote in 
an email interview with The 
Daily. “My dream was to one 
day have my own space where I 
could share my work with other 
makeup lovers like myself. 
Which is why I started my own 
makeup page on Instagram and 
the rest is history.”

Now that Waku has carved 

this space out for herself, 
she has found overwhelming 
support for her work.

“It’s great and overwhelming 

at the same time,” Waku wrote 
of her followers. “I feel very 
grateful to have so many people 
supporting me and giving me 
love. It really keeps me going.” 

Waku does her best to keep 

in touch with her followers and 
foster a dynamic community, 
acting more as a confidant 
and peer than an untouchable 

expert.

“I couldn’t ask for better, 

my followers give me a lot of 
love and support which really 
motivates me to push myself 
more,” Waku wrote. “I love to 
interact with them through 
private messages, answering 
questions 
they 
have, 
give 

them advice, etc. It’s really 
important for me to create a 
strong and durable relationship 
with them.”

This strong community is 

due in part to Waku’s unique 
looks. Instead of opting for 
convention and the every-day, 
Waku’s looks are fantastical 

and 
otherworldly. 
Covering 

her 
face 
with 
colors 
and 

gems, Waku makes Halloween 
makeup glamorous. Her work 
is both beautiful and precise; 
creating 
these 
looks 
using 

makeup techniques such as 
contouring and shading, but 
ending up with something 
entirely other.

“I always feel the need to 

challenge myself when I do 
makeup,” Waku wrote. “I’m 
always looking to improve my 
craft. It’s a way for me step out 
of my comfort zone, learn new 
techniques and overall improve 
my skills and artistry.”

For Waku, makeup isn’t just 

about the end result; there is 
much to be said for the process.

“I’m 
quite 
a 
technical 

person. What I love about 
makeup is trying out new 
techniques or improving my 

own,” Waku wrote. “This way I 
never get bored because I never 
stop learning. I also love to play 
with colors, especially vibrant 
ones, it puts me in great mood 
especially on days where I 
don’t feel at my best.”

But 
Waku 
still 
enjoys 

appreciating the final result 
of her work, the culmination 
of all her research, planning 
and execution. She finds that 
intricate looks, in comparison 
to more ready-to-wear designs, 
are more gratifying.

“I love doing creative and 

intricate looks,” Waku wrote. 
“These kind of looks are the 

most 
time 

consuming 
however 
the 

end 
result 

are 
the 
best 

especially 
when you put 
in the time and 
effort it really 
makes 
the 

difference.”

Like 
many 

other 
artists, 

Waku 
turns 

to other forms 
of 
art 
for 

inspiration 
when planning 
her 
next 

project. 
She 

even 
has 

aspirations 
of 
taking 
on 

other 
artful 

ventures, 
namely music.

“I collect a 

lot of pictures 
that I use for 
inspiration,” 
Waku 
wrote. 

“Some are from 
a 
magazine, 

music 
video 

or other makeup artists that 
inspire me. It really depends 
on what I’m creating ... I 
listen to a lot of music and I 
secretly would love to make 
some as well. This is definitely 
something I have in mind for 
the longest time.”

For Waku, her passions are 

first and foremost fueled by a 
need for self-expression. It is 
this unabashed representation 
of the self in combination with 
sheer talent that has garnered 
Waku such a following. She 
has taken makeup — something 
that 
is 
already 
inherently 

beautiful — and made it art.

“(Makeup) requires work, 

skills, time and effort,” Waku 
wrote. “But above all makeup 
represent a way to express 
myself in a artistic and creative 
way and this is everything to 
me.”

Famed heavy metal band Black Sabbath
Darkness and the Occult: 
A brief history of Doom
A musical manifestation of all things spooky and satanic

Inspired by gruesome death, 

darkness and the occult, Doom 
Metal has become the ultimate 
projection of fear in music. 
The legendary genre rose from 
the ground during 1970 in the 
form of Black Sabbath — the 
high priests of heavy metal, 
the creators of doom. The band 
gave the world an introduction 
to chunky basslines and sleazy 
guitar riffs all played in a slower 
tempo, drenched in haunting 
lyrics to create an inescapable 
eeriness that floods the ears.

Black 
Sabbath 
started 
it 

all after being released in 
the United Kingdom on the 
most appropriate date: Friday 
13, 
1970. 
Frontman 
Ozzy 

Osbourne’s voice floats over the 
slow, dense music and it replaces 
gravity, pushing and pulling 
the body in every direction 
with each word escaping his 
mouth. “Visions cupped within 
a flower / Deadly petals with 
strange 
powers,” 
Osbourne 

sings in “Behind the Wall of 
Sleep.” The song is influenced 
by the common practice in 
Wicca and other cultures of 
using plants to enhance the 
physical and mental states of a 
person and their environments, 
but its demonized to depict a 
resurrection of sorts.

Though Black Sabbath has 

occult influence, they were more 
inspired by the harsh mass of 
death that surrounded Vietnam, 
and they focused on intense 
lyrical content that included 
different renditions of the end 
of the world, war and drug 
addiction. In the song “Hand of 
Doom,” Osbourne sings, “First 
it was the bomb / Vietnam 
napalm / Disillusioning / You 
push the needle in,” describing 
the timeline from soldier to 
drug addict as an effect of PTSD 
in four short lines.

Black 
Sabbath’s 
honest 

representation of the hells on 
Earth and their pioneering 
instrumentals created a recipe 
to 
induce 
terror 
through 

sound, but doom after 1970 
began honing in on the use 

of surrealism in their lyrical 
content. The brutal reality of 
death and horrors in history 
were still present in doom, but 
there was a new portrayal of a 
more monster-esque type of 
darkness. Doom was taking a 
break from the capitalist, war-
hungry cesspool Earth, and 
stepping into the eccentric 
wormhole of nightmares. 

Pentagram executed the new 

strategy effortlessly in their 
1985 
self-titled 
record 
that 

brings fear to life through a more 
occult lens. Some of the album 
is sung from the perspective of 
a supernatural force instead of a 
human observer. In “Sinister,” 
frontman Bobby Liebling sings, 
“I am the priest of Hell make 
a slave of you,” in which the 
narrator becomes Satan.

Liebling manifests as another 

gruesome 
identity 
in 
“The 

Ghoul,” where he sings, “I’ve 
come to desecrate your bones / 
As maggots crawl amongst your 
flesh / You’re soon to meet the 
truth of death.” Its guitar riffs 
ooze desecrated sounds that 
pull the victim in closer to the 
song, while the drums replace 
their heartbeat and shake their 
lungs.

Pentagram’s ability to lace 

their 
murky 
instrumentals 

with gorey lyrics made doom 
more imaginative and creepy. 
It gave way to more varied 
interpretation and odd content 
that was cultivated in the genre 
during the ’90s.

During that time, Electric 

Wizard became the Doom Metal 
oddity composed of cultural 
fascinations 
from 
European 

porn to Detroit garage rock. 
They pulled inspiration from 
the dark masters before them 
and integrated it with other 
horrific material from ’60s and 

’70s gore films and the terror 
tales of H.P. Lovecraft. Their 
album titles reflect some of 
their influences, with names 
like Black Masses, Time to Die, 
Dopethrone 
and 
Witchcult 

Today.

Witchcult 
Today 
sounds 

like the epitome of doom. It 
starts with the sound of crying 
winds and is rancid with chiller 
influences. The second song, 
“Dunwich” is a panicked and 
blackened 
interpretation 
of 

Lovecraft’s 
“The 
Dunwich 

Horror,” a short story about 
horrific events that occur in the 
fictional Dunwich, New England 
surrounded by hills and full of 
silence, with a past of witch-
blood and Satan-Worship. Liz 
Buckingham’s heavy guitar riffs 
and Jus Oborn’s rough, scratchy 
voice envelope the listener into 
a mystic environment, into their 
own personal Dunwich.

Electric Wizard then moves 

from a surreal song inspired by 
a fictional world into something 
inspired by events in history in 
“Torquemada 71,” which calls 
attention to the Spanish friar, 
Tomas de Torquemada, who 
was responsible for the burning 
of 2,000 heretics and for the 
torture and death of many 
more. Oborn’s voice singing, 
“Come now and torture me” 
becomes soaked in heavy guitar 
fuzz and slashy distortion. It 
sounds torturous and drawn 
out, like the dismemberment of 
a body part.

Electric Wizard is a doom 

curated from the disgusting 
truth 
in 
bands 
like 
Black 

Sabbath, 
and 
their 
surreal 

counterparts like Pentagram. 
It melts each influence together 
into a sound of dripping black 
tar from the top of a succubus 
leading to the void. Other 
present doom bands that level 
with Electric Wizard are Sleep 
and Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats, 
who project doom with their 
own blackened style. They keep 
doom thriving after 47 years of 
existing. It remains to be one of 
the most prominent sub-genres 
of metal because of its growing 
sludge sound and consistent 
themes of death, darkness and 
the occult.

The Best 

Scooby Doo! 

Movies to 
Watch this 
Halloween

10. “Scooby Doo 
Pirates Ahoy!”

9. “Scooby Doo and 
the Witch’s Ghost”

This is the one that 

introduces 
the 
Hex 

Girls, 
a 
memorable 

trio of pop-rock sing-
ers that have become 
recurring characters in 
the Scooby Doo fran-
chise. That’s basically 

the 
only 
memorable 

thing about it, but that 
seems worthy enough 
to give it the number 9 
ranking on this list.

Who doesn’t love 

Scooby Doo? The myster-
ies, the chases, the Scooby 
Snacks, everyone has got a 
fond memory of watching 

the Mystery Incorporated 
gang crack a tough case. 
Here’s a rundown of ten 
of Scooby’s greatest (and 
strangest) hits!

IAN HARRIS
Daily Arts Writer

Anyone who thinks 

pirates are rad will 
get a kick out of this 
pirate themed adven-
ture. Released in 2006, 
this is one of the more 
recent entries on the 
list and one of the last 
Scooby Doo movies 
follow the classic struc-

ture of a minor char-
acter being unmasked 
as the villain at the end 
of the story. After this 
the franchise jumped 
the shark a bit, with 
crossovers with WWE, 
WrestleMania, and the 
rock band KISS coming 
soon after.

8. “Scooby Doo and 
Loch Ness Monster”

Is the loch ness 

monster real? Probably 
not, but this mystery 
has some pretty great 
moments anyways. 
Anyone with half a 
brain will likely be 
able to figure out 

who’s behind the mon-
ster in the first ten 
minutes, but remember 
these movies are made 
for kids, so cut it some 
slack.

This Is Spinal Tap (1984)

7. “Scooby Doo and 
the Goblin King”

Certainly one of the 

most bizarre Scooby 
Doo flicks on the 
market, this one finds 

Scooby and Shaggy 
caught up on Hal-
loween night in the 
evil plot of the Goblin 

 6. “Scooby Doo 
Goes Hollywood!”

Scooby and Shaggy 

ditch the TV series to 
become Hollywood 
executives! This movie 
is a raucous send-up of 
late ‘70-s cinema and 

TV, so I would recom-
mend it to anyone who 
enjoys picking out 
references to obscure 
media from yester-
year.

5. “Scooby Doo/

Scooby Doo 
2: Monsters 
Unleashed”

The live action 

Scooby Doo movies 
from the early 2000’s 
are objectively terrible, 
but people of a certain 
age will still find them 
strangely appealing in 
a nostalgic way if noth-
ing else. They’re silly 
and funny and feature 
a young Isla Fisher 

and Alicia Silverstone 
in minor roles. The 
quality degrades sig-
nificantly in the sec-
ond one so it’s really 
no surprise they never 
made a third. And, 
for the record, Linda 
Cardellini as Velma is 
absolutely genius cast-
ing.

4. “Scooby Doo 
and the Alien 

Invasion”

This film from the 

late ‘90-s features 
fake aliens and real 
aliens alike. Recom-
mended for those 
with a sci-fi yearn-

ing, not recommend-
ed for those who 
like happy endings, 
as this story has a 
pretty sad ending for 
Shaggy’s love life.

3. “Scooby Doo 

and the Monster of 

Mexico”

This one’s just a 

classic. The gang 
travels to Mexico 
to visit a friend of 
Fred’s only to dis-
cover a monster is 
terrorizing his town. 

There are some great 
side characters to be 
found here as well as 
the most surprising 
villain reveal of any 
movie on this list.

2. “Scooby Doo on 

Zombie Island”

This movie is gen-

uinely terrifying. My 
brother and I never 
finished watching it 
when we were kids 
because of how scary 
this thing is. There’s 
no playing around 

here, these are real 
zombies after our 
beloved gang, no 
masks, no tricks and 
no treats. Do not 
watch with children. 
Do not watch after 
midnight.

1. “Scooby Doo and 
the Cyber Chase”

Ask anyone what 

his or her favorite 
Scooby Doo movie 
is and this inevita-
bly gets the prize. 
There’s just some-
thing fantastic about 
the mystery gang 
getting sucked into 
a video game rendi-
tion of their lives 
and being forced to 
beat the game or lose 
it all. It’s a classic 
cartoon set-up that 
still provides lots 

of laughs, thrills, 
and a great villain / 
monster to boot. This 
is the movie that 
everyone remembers 
from when they were 
kids and this is the 
Scooby Doo movie 
everyone wants to 
watch again today. 
However, be pre-
pared to feel old 
when you recognize 
how hilariously 
dated the technology 
in this movie is. 

King, who plans to use 
the “Goblin Scepter” 
to control Halloween 
and therefore take 
over the earth. It’s a 

ludicrous plot, and I 
imagine it would be a 
hilarious way to kick 
back after a long night 
out this Halloween.

Freeform

Freeform’s ‘13 Nights of 
Halloween’ sucks (really)

In their network switchup, Freeform forgot the series’ true purpose

When ABC Family transformed 

itself into Freeform in a total 
rebranding 
of 
the 
network 

during the winter of 2015, the 
newly minted title aimed to draw 
what the company called the 
“Becomers” — the generation 
who grew up with ABC Family or, 
more specifically, the millennial 
generation. In a way, breaking 
with ABC Family was an ingenious 
idea that could allow Freeform the 
freedom to add series and movies 
which may not have aligned with 
their previous branding, which 
was aimed primarily at younger 

viewers and families. People enjoy 
continuity in their lives and to 
have an entire network follow 
you as you navigate life is pretty 
damn cool. Too bad Freeform isn’t 
taking advantage of this. 

For those of us who didn’t 

grow up watching the network, 
ABC Family was well-known 
for 
its 
marathon 
specials, 

specifically around Halloween 
and Christmas, aptly titled the 
“13 Nights of Halloween” and the 
“25 Days of Christmas.” During 
those 13 nights, there was never 
a shortage of spooky airings 
that walked the line between 
terrifying 
and 
family-friendly; 

the perfect addition to a brisk 
October 
evening. 
Airings 
of 

staples such as “Hocus Pocus” and 
the Tim Burton films have never 
failed to draw in a large viewer 
base, adult and child alike, and 
the continuous showing of these 
films provide a nice reminiscence 
for those of us who grew up on 
the franchises. In many ways, 
Freeform 
has 
succeeded 
in 

keeping with the early 2000s 
programming, accomplishing its 
mission of keeping the classics 
in the lineup. However, it fails 
in truly incorporating movies 
which would appeal to this same 
generation.

Maybe things were scarier 

when I was 11, but ever since 
the switch to Freeform, the 
channel that’s running is not at 

all reminiscent of the original “13 
Nights.” I guess one could argue 
that “Monster’s University” is 
scary for some — monsters for 
the kids, crippling college debt 
for the adults — but then again, 
it’s a little far-fetched to replace 
Burton classics such as “The 
Corpse Bride” with an airing of 
the “Twilight” saga. While it’s 
easy to understand the reasoning 
there (vampires = Halloween), it’s 
hardly a replacement for classic 
thrillers.

Again, we could argue that 

some of the Halloween movies 
Freeform has been running might 
have been considered frightening 
to our younger selves, but in 
looking at the lineup, it’s clearly 
not the case here, as “Charlie and 
the Chocolate Factory” has been 
added to this year’s “13 Nights,” 
and the only thing remotely scary 
about that movie is Johnny Depp. 
The lack of scare is odd, since 
the conception of the network 
was built around the idea of 
appealing to an older audience. 
Given this premise, it would only 
make sense to air movies which 
were special to our generation 
at different times in our lives. 
Flicks such as “Halloweentown” 
and “Hocus Pocus” would give 
us that old sense of nostalgia 
while newer horror flicks such 
as “Paranormal Activity” or 
“The Conjuring” would appeal 

to the older audience Freeform is 
attempting to target.

In the early 2000s, we were 

graced with the peak years of 
the “13 Nights” promotion. Not 
only were the “Halloweentown” 
movies running constantly, but 
so were scarier films, such as 
“Poltergeist” and “Stephen King’s 
‘It’.” Given the network’s recent 

additions to “13 Nights,” it’s 
almost shocking to see Freeform 
moving in reverse and giving rise 
to more family-friendly films that 
barely pass as Halloween movies. 
With the recent passing of 
Debbie Reynolds, now feels like 
the opportune time to have run 
the “Halloweentown” movies, 
especially 
because 
the 
cast 

recently reunited to honor the 

late-great Reynolds. This isn’t an 
isolated event, though, as recent 
remakes of Halloween originals 
(see: “It” (2017)) also feel like 
missed opportunities.

When “Hocus Pocus” aired 

sporadically last year, much to 
the disappointment of viewers, 
Freeform 
rethought 
their 

strategy. This Halloween, the 
’90s comedy masterpiece will run 
for 24 hours straight, marathon 
style and not unlike TBS’s 24 
hour airing of “A Christmas 
Story” on Christmas Eve. In 
keeping 
with 
the 
Freeform 

tendencies to air theme-specific 
weekend 
marathons, 
a 
Tim 

Burton 
marathon 
will 
also 

run this year — sans “Corpse 
Bride,” 
unfortunately. 
Still, 

these marathons act neither as 
a replacement nor an exception 
for Freeform’s shortcomings in 
providing a lineup which is true 
to its network mission.

Even though some of the 

original “13 Nights” films have 
admittedly fallen away into the 
ABC Family graveyard, what is 
ultimately lost is the purpose of 
switching over to Freeform in the 
first place. That, and we can’t help 
but miss “Halloweentown” and 
Disney’s “Under Wraps.” Because 
who wouldn’t love a mummy (Bill 
Fagerbakke, “Blackish”) dancing 
alone to “All by Myself”? Same, 
mummy. Same.
