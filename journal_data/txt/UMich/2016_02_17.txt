Presenter discusses 
significant historical 
events in the 1970s 

to current day 

By ANDREW HIYAMA 

Daily Staff Reporter

The year 1973 represented 

a great leap forward toward 
equal rights for the gay and 
feminist 
communities 
in 

America 
— 
including 
the 

landmark Roe v. Wade decision, 
which legalized abortion, and 
the removal of homosexuality 
from the American Psychiatric 
Association’s Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual as a mental 
disorder.

However, 
the 
year 
also 

marked a regression in trans 
rights, exemplified by gay 
and feminist protests of trans 
speakers and performers at 
gay liberation events. Susan 
Stryker, associate professor of 

gender and women’s studies 
at the University of Arizona, 
said in a lecture at Rackham 
Building on Tuesday.

Stryker’s address focused 

on how the trans community 
is in a similar oppositional 
position 
currently, 
and 

examined transgender history 
in 
an 
attempt 
to 
better 

understand 
the 
community 

today. The lecture is part of

UHS says over 20 
students confirmed 

ill with similar 

symptoms 

By ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

University officials said Tues-

day that they are looking into a 
spated illness on campus. 

“We have seen approximately 

20 to 25 individuals in the emer-
gency room and health service 
building combined who have had 
a vomiting illnesssometimes with 
diarrhea,” Dr. Robert Winfield, 
executive director of UHS, said. 
“This began sometime last eve-
ning, and people continued to be 
sick through the night, and the 
morning — some people showing 
improvement.”

In an effort to find the cause 

of the outbreak, Dr. Winfield 
has partnered up with the chief 
of the University Hospital’s ER, 
the head of infection control and 

Laura Bauman, an epidemiologist 
at the Washtenaw County Health 
Department. 

“We have tested a number of 

people who are sick by taking 
stool cultures and sending them 
to Michigan Department of Com-
munity Health in Lansing,” Win-
field said. “It takes about three to 
five days to receive results back 
for norovirus testing.”

Winfield said the final count of 

students who have been affected 
will not be known for a few days. 
Of those individuals who became 
ill and sought out help, they tend-
ed to live in either South Quad 
Residence Hall or West Quad 
Residence Hall. However, there 
were four cases that had no affili-
ation with either facility in the 
last few days, UHS reported.

“There are three ways an out-

break can occur,” Dr. Winfield 
said. “This is a season where 
the norovirus, or the cruise ship 
virus, infections can become 
prevalent — it’s a very contagious 
virus and it’s harder to kill with 
regular cleaning supplies. The

Presidential 

candidate holds 
town hall at GOP 

Livonia office 

By SAM GRINGLAS

Daily Staff Reporter

LIVONIA — After departing 

New Hampshire with a much-
needed second place finish last 
week, Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) is 

now banking on an equally strong 
turnout in Michigan to sustain his 
path to the presidency.

The two-term Republican gov-

ernor wrapped up a two-day swing 
through Michigan on Tuesday, 
which included stops at two col-
leges, Michigan State University 
in East Lansing and Grand Valley 
State University outside of Grand 
Rapids, in advance of the state’s 
March 8 primary. During a Tues-
day town hall of a couple hundred 
people held at a local GOP office in 
Livonia, Kasich emphasized both 

his eagerness to promote a conser-
vative agenda — including items 
like securing the border, increasing 
defense spending, passing a bal-
anced budget amendment, cutting 
taxes and regulations — and his 
willingness to work with Demo-
crats to get things done.

“If you think we’re going to fix 

social security by the Republicans 
ramming 
something 
through, 

when you go to bed tonight, check 
under the pillow for the tooth fairy. 
It doesn’t work that way,” he said.

“If I win the White House, we’re 

going to have a conservative agen-
da, and I’m going to be the orches-
tra leader, but I want everybody to 
play in the orchestra, so we can get 
these things accomplished.”

Kasich is currently polling at an 

average of 6 percent in Michigan in 
the most recent poll compiled by 
RealClearPolitics. That leaves him 
in fifth place, ahead only of for-
mer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Trump 
is currently leading the polls in 
Michigan at 38 percent.

However, that limited polling

Wolverines can’t 
rally from down 
eight at halftime 

in Columbus

By LEV FACHER

Daily Sports Writer

COLUMBUS — As Ohio State 

honored former standout Evan 
Turner with a halftime cer-
emony Tuesday night, Michi-
gan’s fans and coaches alike 
might have winced at the mem-
ory of Turner’s buzzer-beating 
3-pointer six years ago.

That shot gave Ohio State a 

stunning win in the 2010 Big 
Ten Tournament and ended the 
Wolverines’ season in the blink 
of an eye. No such heroics were 
necessary Tuesday, however, as 
the Buckeyes (9-5 Big Ten, 17-10 
overall) jumped out to an eight-
point lead at halftime and never 
relinquished it in a 76-66 win 
against Michigan (9-5, 19-8).

The Wolverines have now 

won in Columbus only once in 
the last 14 seasons and came 
out sputtering in the rivals’ only 

regular-season 
matchup 
this 

season. Michigan missed its 
first five attempts from the field 
and quickly fell victim to foul 
trouble, with sophomore guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahk-

man spending the middle part of 
the first half on the bench after 
picking up two quick fouls.

Michigan coach John Beilein, 

who has long refused to send 
players back into games with 
two fouls before halftime, didn’t 
break from tradition, even as 
Michigan failed to generate 
offense with junior Andrew 
Dakich playing point guard.

“Very,” said Michigan coach 

John Beilein, asked how tempt-
ed he was to break his own rule 
by 
sending 
Abdur-Rahkman 

back in to spell Dakich. “But 
again, (the margin) was like two 
or three points with two minutes 
to go. … There’s no reason to say, 
‘OK, the sky is falling. And then 
they scored the last five points to 
make it an eight-point game.’ ”

The Wolverines’ options in 

the backcourt were limited to 
begin with, as senior guard 
Caris LeVert did not play after 
making his return Saturday

TWITTER TALK

ON K A SICH

Prof. urges 

students to consider 

possibility of 

transporting disease

By MEGAN DOYLE

Daiily Staff Reporter

As 
Spring 
Break 
quickly 

approaches, University of Michi-
gan officials have expressed con-

cern about travel to areas affected 
by the Zika virus.

Last week, the University issued 

a warning for travelers from Rob-
ert Winfield, the University’s chief 
health officer.

“As spring break approaches 

and many U-M students, faculty 
and staff are preparing to travel — 
especially to destinations in South 
and Central America, Mexico or 
the Caribbean — I want to share 
important information about the 
Zika virus,” the warning read.

The travel warning referred 

students to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Preventionfor more 
information. The CDC has issued a 
Level 2 travel alert, meaning trav-
elers should “practice enhanced 
precautions” in countries affect-
ed.” These countries include pop-
ular Spring Break destinations, 
such as Mexico, the Caribbean, the 
Pacific Islands and other countries 
in Central and South America. As 
such, the University has issued a 
warning to students planning to 
travel to impacted areas.

Zika 
virus 
outbreaks 
have 

additionally occurred in areas of 
Africa, Southeast Asia, the Pacific 
Islands and the Americas. Puerto 
Rico documented its first case 
of the Zika virus as recently as 
December 2015.

 Joseph Eisenberg, chair and 

professor of epidemiology in the 
School of Public Health, said very 
little research has been done about 
the Zika virus.

“We just don’t know a lot,” 

Eisenberg said. “We want to err 
on the side of everyone being safe, 
and that’s the reason for the travel 
warnings.”

According to the CDC, Zika 

virus is spread primarily through 
mosquito bites. Common symp-
toms include fever, rash, joint pain 
and conjunctivitis or red eyes. The 
illness is fairly mild, with symp-
toms lasting several days to a week, 
but there is no known vaccine to 
prevent it or medicine to treat it.

The concern for the interna-

tional epidemic, however, largely 
comes in the risk for pregnant 
women. Though the symptoms of 
the virus are mild, Zika virus can 
be spread from a pregnant woman 
to her unborn baby, causing a 
serious birth defect called micro-
cephaly. Microcephaly can impact 
brain and skull development in 
infants, which can lead to stillbirth 
or death after a few hours.

Eisenberg noted that the conse-

quences of travel to areas that are 
highly affected with Zika virus 
could affect the larger community.

“One should be fully informed 

of any kind of risk you take and not

LSA senior Cooper Charlton, Central Student Government president, speaks about executive matters at a CSG meeting in 
the Michigan Union on Tuesday.

Body says it’s 

moving forward on 
release of data to 

students

By ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

At their meeting Tuesday, 

Central 
Student 
Government 

addressed progress on a range of 
both long-term issues, like course 
evaluations, and new ones, such 
as resource guide for undocu-
mented students.

Executive Communications
During his executive commu-

nications, CSG President Cooper 
Charlton, an LSA senior, said the 
body is working with faculty on 
moving forward to release course 
evaluations to students.

“There is progress being made 

on course evaluations,” Charlton 
said. “I’m very pleased with our 
collaboration with faculty, spe-
cifically SACUA. Our representa-
tives are fighting hard for student 
rights behind closed doors.”

The release of course evalu-

ations has been a hot topic for 

the assembly since thisfall. After 
an initial move by the Univer-
sity to release the evaluations 
in October, faculty governance 
expressed significant concern 
about the impact of it, ultimately 
voting to block the release later 
that month. Before the vote took 
place, University Provost Mar-
tha Pollack said she would be 
willing to slow down the release 
process if faculty continued to be 
opposed to it.

Since 
then, 
Charlton 
said 

CSG has been working with the 
administration and the Faculty 
Senate to let students have access 
to course evaluation data.

During his remarks, Charlton 

also praised the fact the Univer-
sity Athletic Department said the 
prices for football season tickets 
for Fall 2016 will not increase 
from the previous season.

“I’m excited to see the athletic 

department’s 
commitment 
to 

students,” he said. “Specifically 
around student ticket prices. The 
prices will not increase from last 
year, which is a very strong vic-
tory for students.”

The 
executive 
committee 

also updated the assembly on 

its request for an advisory com-
mittee to preside over elections 
to make sure everything goes 
according to code as CSG’s elec-
tions draw nearer.

CSG counsel Jacob Pearlman, 

Public Policy sophomore, said 
that he had hired third-year law 
student Nick Loukides as the 
body’s assistant student general 
counsel to help enforce the elec-
tion code. According to Pearl-
man, the position’s task is to file 
complaints to the University 
Elections Commission for viola-
tions to the election code.

The position holder will be 

responsible for representing CSG 
in election violation, and will 
write amicus briefs, which the 
body is defining as reports that 
will be generated for each party 
detailing the party’s perspective 
on other election disputes.

The position is new this year, 

and pays $18 an hour.

Resolutions
CSG voted to support the cre-

ation of an “Undocumented Stu-
dent Resource Guide,” an online 
database to serve undocumented 
students and to provide access to

was conducted before results from 
New Hampshire, where Kasich 
pulled in 15.8 percent of the vote 
and bested Florida senator Marco 
Rubio and Texas senator Ted Cruz 
for the second place spot behind 
Trump. Kasich is polling at 4.7 
percent nationally, according to an 
average of recent polls compiled 
by RealClearPolitics.

With the Michigan trip, Kasich 

is mirroring a strategy employed 
during the earliest portion of 
the primary season, in which he 
skipped out on Iowa and its more 
conservative, Evangelical elector-
ate to hold hundreds of town halls 
in the Granite State.

“We have to do really, really 

well in this state, I mean — or I 
have to roll up the carpets and go 
back,” he told a crowd Monday in 
Allendale, home of GVSU. 

Aaron Kall, director of the 

University’s debate team and an 
expert in election politics, said 
Kasich will likely count on Michi-
gan, Ohio’s neighbor to the north, 
to carry him through to his home 
state’s primary the following 
week.

“If he can have a surprise sec-

ond place showing here, that 
would really give him momentum 
going into Ohio, the real prize for 
him,” he said.

According to Kall, Kasich will 

likely concentrate his efforts in 
college towns, Metro Detroit and 
Grand Rapids — places with more 
traditional, moderate Republi-
cans less influenced by Tea Party 
leanings. The Ohio governor has 
emphasized his willingness to 
stray from the party line — telling 
the crowd at Michigan State that 
there is no question that humans 
contribute to global warming 
and that people should accept the 
Supreme Court’s ruling on same-
sex marriage — but also thanked 
the student-heavy crowd for com-
ing, though he wasn’t “giving away 
free college” as Sen. Bernie Sand-
ers (D–Vt.) has proposed.

In Livonia, Kasich also broke 

with the party line in emphasiz-
ing the challenges inherent in 
repealing the Affordable Care Act, 
recalling a woman from Maine 
who told him she spent her whole 
life trying to get health insurance 
until ObamaCare was passed. 
Kasich was one of several Repub-
lican governors, a group that also 
included Michigan Gov. Rick 
Snyder (R), to adopt a Medicare 
expansion in his state through the 
Affordable Care Act.

On Tuesday, he also fielded a 

question from the audience relat-
ed to research funding. He said 
increasing research dollars for 
institutions like the National Insti-
tutes of Health would be a priority, 
and can be done even while curb-
ing the country’s spending overall.

During Tuesday’s event, Kasich 

repeated a family history he often 
shares at town hall events — tell-
ing the crowd that his father was 
a mailman and his grandfather a 
coal miner. That’s a narrative that 
could resonate with blue-collar 
workers in Rust Belt states like 
Michigan.

Steven Gould, a real estate 

developer from Plymouth who 
attended Tuesday’s town hall in 
Livonia, said Kasich reminds him 
of another Midwestern governor: 
Michigan’s Snyder.

“What I mean by that is they’re 

common sense Republicans, and 
they’re administrators,” he said. 
“What they’re doing right now in 
both Ohio and in Michigan is they 
look at our budgets somewhat 
like a business person does over a 
politician, and they prioritize their 
spending. I don’t have a problem 
with compromise. I have a prob-
lem with nothing getting done.”

When it comes to the Flint 

water crisis, Kasich has avoided 
criticism of Snyder but has been 
more vocal about the issue com-
pared to most of the GOP field, 
citing his own experience dealing 
with water contamination in Ohio. 
During a rally in East Lansing, 
Kasich called for increased invest-
ment in infrastructure and tough-
er federal regulations regarding 
how the public is notified of drink-
ing water contamination, though 
he defended Snyder’s response to 
the crisis.

“What I will say is I think 

Snyder’s probably working day 
and night, and probably not even 
sleeping, trying to get on top of 
the whole thing and fix it, but it is 
a challenge. Water is important. 
Clean water is important.”

Throughout Tuesday’s event, 

Kasich kept to his pledge to run a 
positive campaign and declined 
to bash any of the other contend-
ers in the race — Republican or 
Democrat — as is custom at most 
campaign stops.

“There are so many different 

ways the things that the Lord has 
given us can be used to heal this 
world,” he said. “And when we 
think that way, and we go that 
way, and we stop screaming at one 
another because you watch Fox 
News and you watch MSNBC, I 
wear red and you wear blue, you 
know what, we’re all Americans.”

in 
“yearlong 
conversation 

about transformation and its 
histories, politics, aesthetics, 
and 
social 
practices,” 

according to organizers at the 
Institute of Humanities. 

In her lecture, Stryker said 

the anti-trans protests of 1973 
symbolized a reversal of the 
direction things had been 
going 
for 
the 
movements, 

noting that American society 
post-World War II seemed 
especially 
hospitable 
to 

emergent forms of personal 
identity. 

Stryker 
then 
chronicled 

the events of 1973 she thought 
were responsible for the gay 
and feminist abandonment of 
the trans community.

Principle among her list of 

events were the Roe v. Wade 
decision, 
the 
Paris 
Peace 

Accords — which ended U.S. 
involvement in Vietnam — 
and the declassification of 
homosexuality in the DSM.

Although she acknowledged 

the Roe v. Wade decision was 
a victory for women’s right 
to choose, Stryker said the 
case was argued on narrow 
grounds of a liberal right 
to privacy, rather than the 
more fundamental right to 
reproductive autonomy and 
freedom.

“Without 
the 
war 
to 

provide 
a 
common 
focus 

for leftist, third-world and 
countercultural 
activism, 

oppositional 
movements 

began to fracture,” Stryker 
added. 

As well, with the end of 

the Vietnam War and thus 
the end of the draft, gay and 
countercultural men who had 
formerly embraced.

“Personal forms of anti-

masculine 
counter-conduct” 

instead adopted “macho styles 
that are more consonant with 
conventional 
masculinity,” 

she said. 

And although the removal of 

homosexuality from the DSM 
was certainly a victory for 
gay liberation, Stryker said, it 
allowed the gay community, 
now incorporated to a greater 
degree into society, to view 
the trans community as other. 

The anti-trans sentiment 

in 
the 
gay 
and 
feminist 

communities 
wasn’t 

universal, Stryker said, but 
where it did exist, it took an 
intolerant 
tone. 
Speaking 

about trans activist Sylvia 
Rivera’s criticism of the gay 
community during the famous 
Gay Pride Rally in 1973 and its 
harsh reception, Stryker said 
a significant faction within 
the conference viewed trans 
women’s 
existence 
as 
the 

exploitation of women. 

She ended the lecture on 

a hopeful note, pushing her 
audience to take action. 

“We 
can’t 
undo 
the 

decades of estrangement that 
characterized the relationship 
between trans, feminist and 
gay politics,” she said. “But 
we have the materials for 
imagining a counter-history 
at a time when transgender 
issues are now experiencing 
unprecedented 
levels 
of 

visibility. We have a chance 
now, if we are willing to 
embrace it, to reactivate the 
best impulses of that earlier 
time, and bring those visions 
to bear our actions today,” she 
said. 

LSA senior Ashley Burnside 

said she enjoyed the event, 
saying it gave her a better 
perspective of historical anti-
trans movements.

“I 
enjoyed 
how 
she 

incorporated 
the 
video 
of 

Sylvia Rivera’s speech and the 
counter-speech,” 
Burnside 

said. 
“I 
had 
seen 
Sylvia 

Rivera’s speech but not the 
one that went after her, and 
I thought that was really 
interesting to see them both 
together like that and to hear 
her (Stryker’s) response to the 
two speeches.

the consequences of spreading the

He added that Michigan is less 

at risk for spreading the virus than 
warmer areas of the United States 
because mosquitoes carrying the 
virus tend to frequent areas with 
consistently warmer climates.

second way can be food-related, 
and symptoms usually occur six to 
10 hours within consumption. The 
third potential cause is from germs 
that are alive inside some kind of 
food — things like E. coli and Sal-
monella.”

The Office of Public Affairs, 

University Housing and the Uni-
versity Health Service state that 
there is no determination on the 
cause of the vomiting and diar-
rhea outbreak that has occurred 
on campus.

The dining halls also reported 

no absences of their student staff.

Some students affected by the 

illness have turned to social media 
outlets like Twitter and Yik Yak to 
voice their concerns and frustra-
tions, in several cases drawing a 
response from University Dining’s 
Twitter. 

Though the source of the out-

break is still unknown, students 
 

said they believe it has been caused 
by food in South Quad dining.

LSA freshman Sean Lang, said 

he believed he was experiencing 
food poisoning. 

“Yesterday all I had to eat was 

a bowl of Frosted Mini-Wheats 
before my 9 a.m.,” Lang said. 
“Later, I ate at SQuad again, and I 
got a stomach ache around six and 
things went downhill from there. 
I got a pretty bad headache and 
began having diarrhea, and then 
around 11 at night I puked, but only 
once — other people I’ve spoken 
to have complained about puking 
through the night.” 

Amir Baghdadchi, the Univer-

sity 
Housing 
Communications 

director, siad they do not currently 
have any information on the mat-
ter other than the reports of illness 
in both students and faculty.

“At the moment there are 

reports across campus of both 
students and staff falling ill,” 
Baghdadchi said. “We’re work-
ing with University Health Ser-
vice to both treat the students 
and ascertain what the cause is. 
We have no information that sug-
gests that food poisoning is the 
case at this moment. We in Uni-
versity Housing don’t have infor-
mation about it.”

Resident of South Quad Johnny 

Goldenberg, LSA freshman, said 
in an interview he was surprised 
by the Unviersity’s decison not to 
notify residents immediately, not-
ing that several resident advisors 
said they were notified. 

“It’s wrong to try to cover it up 

and not warn students whatso-
ever,” he said.

Goldenberg added he feels the 

University did not acknowledge 
the situation, possibly contribut-
ing to the spread of a potential 
virus. 

“It’s just weird because if 

people went the hospital last 
night, people have been eating 
the entire day (at South Quad) 
and even if it’s gone, they could 
at least be like ‘some of these 
foods might have stuff in them be 
careful’ but there was nothing,” 
Goldenberg. “And a lot of people 
are really mad about this. In my 
opinion it’s really a mishandling 
of the situation. Because people 
have finals too, like people can-
not get sick right now and people 
are barfing their brains out.”

According to the resolution, 

the responsibility for the mainte-
nance of the guide would either 
fall under the duties of Campus 
Inclusion Commission chair or 
to someone else to be appointed 
to the body at a later date.

Another

since Aug. 1, 2015, after the 
retirement of previous Police 
Chief John Seto. Seto had been 
with the AAPD for 25 years and 
transferred to a position in the 
University Housing Security 
and Safety Services in May 
2015.

Baird’s 
appointment 

was 
well 
received 
among 

the 
councilmembers. 
Jack 

Eaton (D–Ward 4), who had 
expressed support for White, 
embraced Baird’s appointment 
and 
stressed 
that 
Baird 

deserved unanimous support 
from Council.

“James 
Baird 
is 
a 
very 

capable professional of the 
highest integrity,” Eaton said.

Julie Grand (D–Ward 3) 

praised Baird’s patience and 
dedication throughout the long 
process, noting she appreciated 
his constant thoughtfulness 
and responsiveness.

“After everything, he still 

remains committed to Ann 
Arbor,” Grand said.

Councilmember 
Chuck 

Warpehoski 
(D–Ward 
5) 

expressed 
confidence 
in 

Baird’s capability as police 
chief, pointing to an interview 
between the appointee and 
councilmembers during which 
Baird 
discussed 
addressing 

biases in police training.

Baird became deputy police 

chief in 2013 and has held 

other 
positions 
throughout 

his 23-year career with the 
AAPD, including professional 
standards lieutenant and crisis 
response unit sergeant.

Also discussed at Tuesday’s 

meeting was the topic of Ann 
Arbor’s deer cull, which has 
been an ongoing controversy 
in the city in recent months. 
Several speakers at the meeting 
charged that the decision to 
carry out the cull was based 
on 
little 
statistically 
valid 

evidence.

Lorraine Shapiro, Ann Arbor 

resident, cited a Feb. 1 post on 
the city website that said a deer 
management assessment report 
will be conducted in May, 
which will include results from 
an Ann Arbor City Hall survey. 
Shapiro 
expressed 
concern, 

pointing to a prior 2014-2015 
survey which showed support 
for the cull that she said was 
flawed and biased.

Shapiro alleged that the 

survey was taken by less than 
0.4 percent of the Ann Arbor 
population, citing a sample 
bias. She also claimed three 
questions began with a pro-cull 
statements.

Challenging 

councilmembers to be more 
transparent about the purposes 
and 
motivations 
behind 

surveys, she said she expects 
them to include all stakeholders 
in a statistically valid, unbiased 
survey during the next round of 
data collection.

“Let’s do a statistically valid 

survey this time,” Shapiro said. 
“Let’s have no more garbage in, 
garbage out.”

Audience members carrying 

signs reading “Stop the shoot” 
and “Save the deer” applauded 
and cheered, “Stop the shoot.” 
during remarks.

Grant Shafer, Ann Arbor 

resident, 
was 
also 
among 

the residents who expressed 
disapproval toward the deer 
cull. He suggested that the 
USDA 
Wildlife 
Services 

violated the terms of their 
permit, citing a story of a 
resident who reported a deer 
shot outside the permit period. 
He also called for another 
investigation into poaching in a 
unspecified densely populated 
neighborhood, 
saying 
that 

either Wildlife Services or 
poachers fail to clean up the 
deer remains.

Other sanitation concerns 

about the cull were brought 
up at Tuesday’s meeting. One 
resident said he was worried 
that the bullets used to kill 
the deer would contaminate 
potential meat sources used in 
food pantries.

The 
city’s 
agreement 

with 
Food 
Gatherers 
is 
a 

requirement for the city’s deer 
cull 
permit, 
and 
Michigan 

Radio reported the president of 
Food Gatherers, Eileen Spring, 
is certain the deer meat will 
uphold food safety regulations.

dents about the virus.

“I kind of just hope it won’t 

really affect me, but obviously 
I’m aware of it now, which I think 
is good,” Meyers said. “So if any-
thing weird goes on, or people 
get sick or something, obviously 
I’ll be more careful, but I’m not 
too concerned about it.” 

Despite the warnings from 

the University, some students 
planning travel to the area have 
expressed their skepticism.

Meyers noted that as most 

Zika virus warnings focus on 
women who are currently or 

are planning to become preg-
nant, he felt it did not necessar-
ily apply to him.

LSA sophomore Zac Vogt, 

who will be going on a Carib-
bean cruise for Spring Break, 
echoed 
Meyers’ 
sentiment 

about the travel warnings. He 
said he did not read the Uni-
versity’s e-mail containing the 
travel warnings, though he has 
heard about Zika virus on the 
news.

“I’m not very concerned,” 

Vogt said. “It doesn’t affect me.”

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

As soon as I heard the news, I immediately 

dialed my grandparents to let them know 
— we like to keep each other up to date on 
current events, lest we both fall too deep into 
our respective “bubbles.” Upon answering 
the phone, however, my grandmother beat me 
to it. “Scalia is dead!” she happily informed 
me. Happily.

As our conversation progressed, I began to 

realize that her detestation of Justice Antonin 
Scalia was deep-seated and, quite honestly, 
justified. It’s pretty easy to see why a woman 
who grew up in the Jim Crow South would 
take objection to a Supreme Court justice 
who claimed in court that he was “just not 
impressed by the fact that the University of 
Texas may have fewer (African Americans). 
Maybe it ought to have fewer.”

Still, I have a moral problem with celebrating 

the death of any human being — especially one 
whose only crime was disagreeing with me (on 
about every topic imaginable, but that’s beside 
the point). In America, we pride ourselves on 
freedom of speech. Underlying this concept 
is the idea that free speech guarantees all of 
our nation’s voices are heard and valued, on 
both sides of the political spectrum. When I 
recognized that Justice Scalia’s views weren’t 
outliers in our greater contemporary society — 
that is to say, many Americans shared the same 
values he stood for and defended — I began to 
at least wonder if maybe he did deserve a spot 
on the bench.

Cultures do, however, change a lot over 

time. When Justice Scalia was nominated by 
former president Ronald Reagan in September 

1986, the American political landscape was 
vastly different than its current-day form. In 
1986, the same year Scalia was appointed, the 
Supreme Court of the United States upheld 
an anti-sodomy law that banned homosexual 
acts in the state of Georgia. Today, however, 
a majority of Americans support same-sex 
marriage (in comparison, just 35 percent 
supported it 10 years ago).

These numbers seem to suggest that Scalia’s 

presence on the court, while maybe it made 
sense when he was appointed, didn’t make 
sense in 2016. However, that argument ignores 
the reality that 39 percent of Americans still 
do not feel that same-sex couples should be 
allowed to marry. While that is 11 percent 
shy of a majority, it stills shows that a large 
section of U.S. citizens hold views that Scalia 
defended. Without him on the court, would 
their voices have been heard and considered. 
It’s not that I think basic rights should be left 
to the tyranny of the majority, but at the end of 
the day, we do live in a democracy where these 
issues are discussed. 

All of this is to say that despite the vitriol 

surrounding Justice Scalia, he was not the 
boogeyman we often paint him to be. Rather, 
he is a product of our democracy, and all he did 
was ensure that all of our country’s voices were 
heard. At the end of the day, I try not to forget 
that just because I didn’t agree with many of 
Scalia’s core tenets, others did agree with him. 
And they have just as much of a right as I do to 
be represented on the bench.

 In defense of Scalia

Connecting in the winter

S

houtout 
to 
all 
current 

freshmen: 
You 
missed 
a 

couple of really hard winters, 

and we got a 
taste 
of 
what 

those 
winters 

felt like this past 
weekend. Those 
who’ve been at 
the 
University 

for a year or 
two 
might 

have 
a 
better 

understanding 
of 
what 
I’m 

talking 
about 

— 
that 
bone-

chilling, 
soul-

sucking, wind-chill-induced cold. 
For students who moved to Ann 
Arbor or the state of Michigan 
from far away, this kind of winter 
weather probably feels like a 
never-ending nightmare.

Subdued by the winter chill, I 

find myself turning to my cell phone 
and laptop for distraction, and I 
know I’m not alone in this. When 
we’re trapped inside on frigid 
days (such as this past Saturday, 
with wind chill registering in the 
negative teens and 20s), I find 
that human communication takes 
second place to whatever new 
things the Internet has to tell me. 
It becomes all too easy to curl up 
under a blanket, turn on Netflix and 
tune out everything else.

It’s cold, and everyone has the 

excuse of being burnt out after 
fall 
semester. 
That 
shouldn’t 

be an excuse to forgo making 
connections, but it often is. I’m not 
necessarily talking about phone 
conversations — I mean those 
person-to-person interactions that 
happen at random when you’re 
walking 
across 
campus, 
those 

times when your eyes meet and 
you smile at someone you don’t 
know. Instead of giving those 
interactions a chance to happen, 
the cold weather offers an excuse 
to watch our feet instead of trying 

to care about others. We keep our 
shoulders hunched as we rush 
between classes, trying to spend as 
little time as possible in the snow 
and wind. Hoods are pulled up; knit 
hats and headbands shield our eyes. 
Earbuds block out the sound of 
slush crunching underfoot. People 
don’t stop to exchange smiles with 
the strangers they pass.

This past weekend, I did my best 

to bury myself in assignments and 
make the time pass by tidying up 
my space. It always feels good to get 
homework done well before it’s due, 
but what makes more of a dent in my 
day is visiting with my family. When 
it gets really cold, the same barrier 
that restricts conversations in the 
middle of the Diag seems to hang 
over the house, making everything 

a drag. When I’m already curled up 
on the couch, the last thing I want 
is to face the wider world — even 
if that just means my dining room. 
It can seem like too much effort to 
start a conversation.

But often, time spent talking that 

way lights up the cold and snowy 
air outside and helps the day to go 
by a little faster. Coming together 
over meals forces us to spend time 
together, even if we’re just sitting 
side by side and reading — it gives 

us a chance to acknowledge one 
another, and the work that goes into 
preparing our food means a chance 
to drag ourselves away from our 
screens and back into the world.

On campus, I’ve had other 

little interactions that gave richer 
meaning to these winter weeks. I 
stopped by the office of a professor 
I took a class with in the fall; asked 
a girl who’d slipped and fallen on 
the ice if she was OK; encountered 
someone who’s doing the New 
England Literature Program this 
coming spring and got to tell her 
that I was in her place one year 
ago. When I have a dollar in my 
wallet and a minute to spare on 
my way from one class to another, 
I stop and buy a Groundcover on 
the corner of South U and East U. 
My phone stays put away while I 
cross campus, which means I’m 
looking up and watching what’s 
going on around me. If the wind 
isn’t blowing so hard that I need 
my hood up, I do my best to smile 
at everyone I pass.

Not everything about winter 

is good, but not everything is 
terrible, either — as with anything 
else, there’s a give-and-take. With 
two decades’ worth of Ann Arbor 
winters already behind me, I look 
for the things that make winter 
beautiful: the snow-covered Arb 
and frozen Huron River, sunsets 
in purple and gold, the number of 
times people return my smiles. The 
cold bothers me as much as anyone 
else, but there are other things 
to focus on; temperature isn’t 
the single thing that defines this 
season. Good food and pleasant 
company can help to break up the 
monotony of gray days. Spring 
always comes again, so we might 
as well enjoy the months leading 
up to it — and maybe even forge 
some new friendships along the 
way.

JASON ROWLAND | OP-ED

C

ollege students are perhaps some of 
the most educated and opinionated 
voters in the country, as we exist in a 

sphere of constant debate 
and idealism (and political 
memes, too). However, we 
often focus on the larger, 
more dramatic political 
theaters — federal and 
international governments 
— and end up ignoring the 
equally important local 
politics of the areas and 
states in which we reside.

Zachary 
Ackerman, 

recent 
University 
of 

Michigan graduate, Ann 
Arbor City Council member, and former Daily 
columnist, who was kind enough to sit down 
for an interview with the Daily, defies this 
phenomenon. He serves as a great example 
of how to get involved in local politics. At the 
age of 22, Ackerman was the first University 
student to be elected to a spot on the Ann 
Arbor City Council in 23 years when he took 
office this fall. He ran a fierce campaign and 
was elected, in part, because he went door to 
door launching a ground campaign to get to 
know voters on a more personal level.

Though becoming an elected official is a 

daunting task, starting much smaller can also 
be rewarding. Ackerman has done exactly that, 
working as an intern for a local candidate Pam 
Byrnes campaign to be a representative in the 
U.S. House in 2014. Needing signatures from 
citizens for a petition to get Byrne on the ballot, 
he had to stand outside of the Jackson Post 
Office on tax day in freezing temperatures. 
During those hours, he met a diverse group 
of people who illustrated an important part of 
local politics.

The first man he met drove up in a 

pickup truck, covered in the trappings of a 
construction worker or carpenter. This man 
had no interest in politics, so he didn’t sign the 
petition that Ackerman was offering. He went 
into the post office, sent what he needed, got 
in his truck and left. However, for some reason 
he returned and gave Ackerman a handful of 
hand warmers, and signed the petition before 
leaving again.

Next, there were three women, who when 

he stepped forward and asked them to sign, 
declined, as they supported Republican 
candidate Tim Walberg in the race. They were 
about to go on their way when Ackerman 

noticeably shivered, and in that moment, they 
agreed to sign, saying they would do it if it got 
him home sooner.

Finally, another man wandered up to the 

post office. He listened intently, and very 
earnestly wanted to get involved. However, 
when Ackerman offered to let him sign, he 
made several unintelligible marks on the paper 
that wouldn’t count as a signature. Despite 
being illiterate, this man was trying valiantly 
to be involved in the political process.

In each of these cases, the decision of 

these individuals to get involved depended 
on an emotional response, not an ideological 
urge. These interactions illustrate why 
local politics is so important: They make 
us realize our personal and emotional 
connection to politics, and allow us to be 
easily involved. If you knew your vote on a 
proposal would perhaps save you a flat tire 
in the future, because it would have passed 
a road repair bill, would you have used it? 
If you realized you could influence state 
politics by volunteering in a campaign that 
might help improve the schools in your 
area for your children, would you do so? If 
becoming representative could help better 
improve your life and the lives of those close 
to you, why not become one?

Sadly, in a country with low voter turnout 

in every type of election, local elections 
have the worst voter turnout of all. This fact, 
paired with distrust of both the government 
and the parties that compete to run it, leads 
to a democratic process in a severe state of 
disarray, where few people seem to want to 
answer these questions.

While I am not arguing we turn inward 

and ignore the role that national elections 
have, focusing on local politics can have just 
as profound an impact. Each of us can answer 
those questions in our own little, unique ways. 
We can answer them by voting, volunteering 
or serving. We can answer them by running 
for office, or working to help a city council 
member get elected. Or we can do so by a much 
simpler action, such as filling out a petition for 
a statewide or national issue. We can change 
our campus, our hometown or wherever we 
may live in the future by participating in local 
politics. By changing that little bit we can on 
an individual basis in the places we live, we 
can, together, change a lot.

Introducing Your Michigan

The University of Michigan is 

a community full of diverse ideas 
— of brilliant, compassionate and 
kind students. Most importantly, 
the University would not be the 
place it is without you. Student 
input and advocacy make this 
place the amazing university it is. 
Without your voice and work, this 
campus wouldn’t be the special 
place that it is for our generation 
of students and for the next 
generation of Wolverines.

That’s why we write today 

to announce our candidacy and 
express how excited we are to 
hear your voice, your ideas and 
your beliefs. As a new party, Your 
Michigan wants to create an 
atmosphere in Central Student 
Government where all students’ 
narratives and ideas are not only 
heard, but supported as well. We 
understand the limits of Central 
Student Government, but believe 
in the limitless nature of student 
activism here at the University. 
Join us as we work toward tangible 
change — as we shape effective 
and innovative policies that better 
every student’s experience.

Your 
Michigan’s 
executive 

team, Thomas Hislop and Cam 
Dotson, have the leadership skills, 
experience and love for the maize 
and blue that CSG needs today. We 
are committed to changing the 
culture of student representation 
that currently exists, and ensuring 
that 
all 
experiences 
on 
this 

campus are appreciated, heard 
and considered. Our experience 
has taught us how to govern 
effectively, but it has also shown 
us that change is needed.

Join us as we revitalize the 

Maize Rage and move the upper 
bowl student section to the center 
of the court so that students are 
more connected and united during 
basketball games. We are working 
with the Athletic Department to 
create a revamped Maize Rage 
that is both financially feasible 
and 
brings 
students 
closer 

together. We are not blindly 
promising more lower bowl seats, 

but rather thinking creatively as to 
what seating arrangements allow 
for the best student experience 
possible. 
As 
the 
University 

prepares to welcome our new 
athletic director, Warde Manuel, 
it is imperative that our campus 
leaders ensure student input is 
considered and that the student 
experience 
at 
athletic 
events 

continues to improve.

Join 
us 
as 
we 
engage 
in 

meaningful 
discourse 
about 

sexual misconduct on campus. 
We want to advocate for more 
peer educators in extracurricular 
clubs, athletic teams and Greek 
organizations. We want to expand 
the 
Panhellenic 
Association’s 

very successful Peer Educator 
Program so that more groups have 
a resource that can educate them 
on this important issue and help 
in their times of need. This will 
create a bridge between student 
groups and the Sexual Assault 
Prevention and Awareness Center, 
so that students who want to learn 
more or need support have an 
easy path to SAPAC’s incredible 
resources.

Join us as we foster dialogue 

between 
CSG 
representatives 

and students through town-hall 
forums 
with 
student-dictated 

agendas. In the past, students 
have voiced their concerns that 
CSG is not transparent enough. 
We want students to feel that we 
are a resource for them and truly 
represent them. Your Michigan 
will 
empower 
students 
by 

creating town-hall forums that, 
on occasion, replace the formal 
CSG meetings. These forums will 
promote a productive dialogue 
between 
elected 
officials 
and 

students who want their voices to 
be heard but who are turned away 
by the formal format of the weekly 
CSG meetings.

Join us as we create a more 

diverse university of tomorrow by 
supporting student organizations 
that do amazing work in nearby 
urban 
communities. 
President 

Schlissel recently commented on 

increasing the amount of minority 
representation on campus, and 
Your Michigan is dedicated to 
assisting 
in 
that 
process. 
As 

the 
administration 
works 
to 

increase 
minority 
enrollment, 

Your Michigan wants to assist 
and support the organizations 
doing great work in surrounding 
communities by subsidizing these 
programs’ 
traveling 
expenses, 

and show these students that 
the University is an attainable 
destination for any motivated 
student.

Join us as we establish a new, 

centralized mentorship program 
for 
incoming 
international 

students to ease their transition 
into 
this 
rigorous, 
new 

environment. 
Our 
program, 

“Welcome 
hoMe,” 
will 
ease 

international students’ transition 
to this major American public 
university. The program is rooted 
in the concerns of international 
students who often arrive and feel 
isolated or disjointed from the rest 
of the student body. It is incredibly 
important that we provide these 
fellow Wolverines support just as 
we do for other students through 
programs such as Leaders and 
Best. Our centralized program 
would provide a group of trained, 
dedicated 
mentors 
to 
any 

international student as soon as 
they arrive on campus.

Join us. It’s your time, your voice 

and your Michigan. These are just a 
few of our ideas, as we continue to 
advocate for a safer, innovative and 
empowering campus. Our platform 
is far from finalized; we want to 
make sure that you have a chance 
to deliver feedback, to give your 
thoughts and to make an impact. 
Feel free to reach out to us through 
social media, and make sure to come 
join Your Michigan this Thursday 
at 7 p.m. in the Ross School of 
Business room R1240. Your voice 
matters, and we want to make sure 
it is heard on this campus.

Cam Dotson and Thomas 

Hislop are LSA juniors.

CAM TOSON AND THOMAS HISLOP | OP-ED


So. Much. Sweat. More sweat 

than I’d sweated at Disney 
World, late afternoon in mid-
July, waiting in an hour-long 
line for the teacup ride. More 
sweat 
than 
I’d 

sweated 
in my first 
college 
cross 
country 
meet, 
a 

2 
p.m. 

race 
in 

95-degree 
heat, after 
which my 
teammate had to be driven to 
the hospital for heat exhaustion.

If you’ve ever practiced hot 

yoga, like the Hot Vinyasa class 
at Center For Yoga, you know 
exactly about the sweat I’m 
talking about.

At first, you welcome the heat 

— the 100-degree yoga studio 
is dimly lit, a deliciously warm 
haven for your frozen body. You 
stretch happily on your mat, 
feeling your toes thaw out. You 
bend into Child’s Pose, sinking 
into the floor like a puddle, 
letting stressful thoughts slip 
away.

Thirty minutes later, you’re 

the one slipping away, because 
a yoga mat is no match for 
the obscene amount of sweat 
pouring out of you. In the 
classroom, things aren’t so zen 
anymore — “Radioactive” by 
Imagine Dragons is pumping 
through the walls, the guy 
next to you has his backside in 
your face doing Star Pose, and 
you’re kicking yourself for not 
bringing a towel to class. As 
you hold a never-ending plank 
position, adjusting your sweaty 
hands, you can’t remember why 
you liked the heat in the first 
place, or why you thought yoga 
was meditative.

You might even wonder, is 

hot yoga worth the hype? 

Though 
hot 
yoga 
was 

introduced to the U.S. relatively 
recently, popularized by Bikram 
Choudhury (founder of “Bikram 
Yoga”) in San Francisco in 1972, 
its roots stretch much farther in 
history. For centuries, yoga has 
been performed in heat out of 
necessity. India, the birthplace 
of yoga, is notoriously hot — 
temperatures average around 
100 degrees in the summer 
— and with infrequent air 
conditioning, heated yoga is a 
given. So when Choudhury and 
other yoga masters moved to 

cooler climates, they noticed 
they 
were 
shivering 
while 

holding 
their 
poses. 
They 

soon brought space heaters to 
studios, believing that a heated 
room allows muscles to loosen, 
blood capillaries to dilate and 
toxins to be released.

Today, you can practice yoga 

in an 100-plus degree room 
almost anywhere in the U.S. 
— even if you live in an arctic 
climate like Ann Arbor. But as 
much as hot yoga enthusiasts 
promote the benefits of heat, 
there’s reason to be wary of the 
practice. In a recent study sent 
out by the American Council 
on Exercise, researchers were 
shocked to find that yoga 
participants’ heart rates and 
core body temperatures had 
skyrocketed after a 90-minute 
Bikram Yoga class, with one 
man reporting a temperature of 
104 degrees and a heart rate in 
the 92 percentile of maximum 
heart rate.

“The dramatic increases in 

heart rate and core temperature 
are 
alarming 
when 
you 

consider that there is very little 
movement, and therefore little 
cardiovascular training, going 
on during class,” said Emily 
Quandt, the leader of the study, 
in a press release.

Physicians agree that body 

temperatures 
above 
100 

degrees can be classified as 
a fever, while a temperature 
exceeding 
104 
degrees, 
or 

hyperthermia, is considered 
life-threatening and requires 
immediate medical attention. 
The cure for hyperthermia 
is intuitive: get to a cooler 
place. But in an hour-long or 
90-minute continuous class, 
with the room temperature set 
at 105 degrees, there is really no 
reprieve from heat. And though 
our bodies fight to keep cool — 
hence the buckets of sweat — 
our natural tendency is to wipe 
the sweat from our face and 
hands, which dangerously traps 
in even more heat to our bodies.

“I tell my students to never 

wipe their faces,” said Bryan 
Bennett, a lead instructor at 
the Center For Yoga, who met 
me for coffee at Elixir Vitae. He 
explained that the heat opens 
up our pores, allowing not only 
cooling sweat but impurities 
to be released. When we close 
these pores by wiping our 
faces, we absorb both the heat 
and unhealthy toxins, which 
can cause blackheads and skin 
irritation.

Bennett cites the heat of hot 

yoga for more than just glowing 
skin. During his 200 hours of 
training, he was taught the 
core reason for heated yoga: 
like metal, the human body can 
bend into any form if enough 
heat is applied. The heat of the 
room, coupled by the heat built 
up in our bodies during an hour-
long class, allows us to stretch 
further and breathe deeper 
— both keys to a better yoga 
practice. Still, Bennett believes 
that heat isn’t necessary for 
yoga; besides loosening the 
body, heat mainly functions as 
a distraction.

“In yoga, you’re taught to 

resist all reactions,” Bennett 
said. “The highest form of 
yoga, meditation, is complete 
stillness of the body and mind. 
When you’re in a hot room, 
there’s a new obstacle to hurdle 
— you have to accept the sweat, 
let it fall, then find your breath 
again.”

What 
about 
the 
risks 

of 
hot 
yoga? 
“There 
have 

definitely been people who 
are 
ill-prepared,” 
Bennett 

said. “If you’re hungover and 
dehydrated, or have a heart 
condition, hot yoga is not for 
you. Pregnant women shouldn’t 
practice either, unless their 
bodies are accustomed to the 
heat.”

Bennett said with proper 

hydration, 
patience, 
and 

practice, hot yoga has the power 
to improve muscle strength, 
flexibility, physical immunity, 
mood 
and 
mindfulness, 

which are all essential to busy 
college students. After all, he 
explained, yoga poses were 
established as a way to loosen 
the stiff joints and weary 
minds of monks who had been 
meditating all day — not too 
different from a long night of 
homework in the Stacks.

As I listened, I remembered 

my own hot yoga experience: 
the heat, the sweat, the wishing 
it would be over already. I 
certainly didn’t feel meditative 
during the class, but for the 
entire hour, I was focused on 
one thing: finishing. For the 
first time in days, no thoughts 
of school, to-do lists, or dinner 
plans had crossed my mind. 
Maybe zen comes in sweaty 
packages after all.

‘Murder’ flounders 
with cliched premiere

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

Daily Arts Writer

ABC’s “How To Get Away 

With Murder” is one psychotic 
break away from not getting 
away 
with 

murder at all. 
Wrapped 
up 

in 
a 
tangled 

mess of lies, the 
characters 
of 

Shondaland’s 
latest hit return 
for the second 
mid-season 
premiere, 
and are more 
twisted 
than 
ever. 

While Viola Davis puts on a 
performance well-deserving of 
another Emmy, the rest of the 
mid-season premiere falls victim 
to a haunted past that casts a 
shadow on the show’s future.

The second season opened 

with a shock as Annalise Keating 
(Viola Davis, “The Help”) lays 
screaming for help in a pool 
of her own blood. Loyal fans 
took to the #WhoShotAnnalise 
hashtag, tweeting predictions 
and reactions each week for the 
highly 
anticipated 
Thursday 

night 
Shonda 
extravaganza. 

November’s mid-season finale 
finally provided some answers, 
but in true Shonda Rhimes 
fashion, the answers were not 
nearly as satisfying as one would 

have hoped. Providing little 
clarity, Thursday night’s episode 
spans six agonizing weeks of 
Annalise’s recovery, resurrecting 
old demons uncovered at the 
shooting as she attempts to save 
herself and the Keating team 
from murder’s consequences yet 
again.

After an electrifying first 

season, “How To Get Away With 
Murder” is falling into the all-
too-familiar structure of most 
murder/crime shows: someone 
does something really stupid 
(usually murder), and, instead of 
coming clean, tries to cover it up. 
Eventually, the consequences of 
the first really stupid thing don’t 
seem that bad compared to the 
mess of blood, lies and betrayal 
that have accumulated as a 
result of the cover-ups (usually 
more murders), and an initially 
captivating show becomes too 
convoluted for its own good. 
Slowly, rooting for the characters 
who were initially at the wrong 
place at the wrong time becomes 
harder as “victims of unfortunate 
circumstance” 
are 
stripped 

down to “empty villains.” Such 
is the fate that plagues Wes 
(Alfred Enoch, “Harry Potter”), 
one of the Keating Five and the 
undeniable center of all the 
murderous fallout. One wrong 
decision after another, Wes, 
the doe-eyed underdog at the 
beginning, 
has 
steadily 
lost 

relatability with viewers, and 

the psychological trauma he is 
unable to shake off in the second 
mid-season 
premiere 
further 

alienates him. However, Wes is 
not only the center of his own 
destruction, but of Annalise’s 
as well. A complicated back-
story between the two begins 
to unfold at the expense of the 
rest of the characters, stealing 
time from Laurel (Karla Souza, 
“Instructions 
Not 
Included”) 

and Frank’s (Charlie Weber, 
“90210”) budding relationship 
and 
Bonnie’s 
(Liza 
Weil, 

“Gilmore Girls”) turn to the 
dark side, as flashback-driven 
storylines compete for screen 
time with those unfolding in 
real-time.

Despite 
the 
decline 
in 

character and plot development, 
“How 
To 
Get 
Away 
With 

Murder” still shines with a 
groundbreaking 
performance 

from leading lady Viola Davis. 
High on painkillers and bleeding 
through her raw stitches, Davis is 
mesmerizingly disturbed in the 
best way. Drug-laced strawberry 
ice cream spills down her chin 
as she slips into a hallucinogenic 
frenzy, and yet she is still able 
to pull her shit together to 
outsmart everyone in court. Her 
pain, however haunting, is what 
keeps the ruthless lawyer in the 
realm of humanity, allowing the 
complexity of her character to 
color a show overwhelmed in 
unrelatable darkness.

FILM REVIEW

Unfiltered love in ‘45’

By ANA LUCENA

Daily Arts Writer

In the movie industry, having 

the love life of an older couple as 
the focus of a film is a welcom-
ing change — a breath of fresh 
air from the 
slew 
of 
fun 

but short-lived 
flings between 
young 
adults 

that flood the 
market. Since 
unhappy mar-
riages are the 
cinematic 
norm, 
the 

authentic portrayal of the suc-
cessful relationship between the 
two in “45 Years” made the film 
even more endearing.

The film is about Kate (Char-

lotte Rampling, “The Forbid-
den Room”) and Geoff Mercer 
(Tom Courtenay, “Dad’s Army”), 
an elderly couple planning a 
party for their 45th wedding 
anniversary. The festivities are 
to compensate for their 40th 
anniversary 
celebration 
that 

was cancelled due to Geoff’s 
unanticipated bypass surgery. 
The speed with which the back-
story is introduced through dia-
logue 
without 
compromising 

the linear narrative is remark-
able. Six days before the party, 
Geoff receives a letter inform-
ing him that the body of his ex-

lover Katya, from the 1960’s, was 
finally discovered in a glacier in 
Switzerland, where he last saw 
her before she was trapped in a 
crevasse. This memory from his 
past causes him to lament the 
loss of his carefree youth. The 
way Kate supports him through 
this identity crisis, from encour-
aging him to pick up the German 
he lost from his time abroad to 
comforting him when he has 
difficulties in bed, is touching. 
Her sweet nature makes the 
intimacy 
and 
understanding 

of the relationship a beautiful 
promise to root for. The couple 
divides the household chores 
around each of their strengths 
and sleeping schedules, dem-
onstrating their compassion for 
each other as individuals. It’s no 
surprise they are still together 
after so many years, as the two 
have learned how to skillfully 
meet each other’s needs.

However, 
Kate 
becomes 

increasingly 
upset 
as 
Geoff 

becomes 
preoccupied 
with 

Katya. He goes so far as to show 
interest in going back to Switzer-
land and seeing her one last time 
before she is buried. The blatant 
disregard Geoff has towards the 
big celebration of their anniver-
sary illustrates the drama of the 
film — Kate restrains Geoff’s 
individuality, wanting the two 
of them to equally contribute to 
their achievements as a couple. 

The opposing yet reasonable 
desires of both characters solidi-
fies the conflict.

There is not much plot to “45 

Years,” but the film paints the 
entire world of elderly couples 
with excellent care. The per-
formances by Rampling and 
Courtenay 
are 
outstanding, 

bringing to life the nuances of 
their respective conflicted char-
acters. The use of intertitles to 
divide the plot into six distinct 
days keeps the plot continually 
developing without ever letting 
the pacing or structure of the 
film feel predictable. It manages 
to highlight the film’s realism 
without ever breaking its focus 
on the fate of the Mercers’ rela-
tionship, which is no easy feat 
considering the vivid characters 
that populate the protagonists’ 
lives.

In an age where over 30 per-

cent of marriages end in divorce, 
it is heartening to see such a 
tender portrayal of enduring 
attachment. Not the happy end-
ings of fairy tales, but the actual 
commitment of two people who 
care for each other and want to 
fight the world by each other’s 
side in spite of their differences. 
Even though it is but one puri-
fying drop in the sea of sleazy 
romance films, “45 Years” is 
testament to the fact that we 
are still capable of entertaining 
the elusive concept of true love,

‘Triplets’ come to A2

By KELLY MARTINEK

Daily Arts Writer

On Friday, the University 

of Michigan’s Musical Society 
will present “The Triplets of 
Belleville,” 
an event that 
combines cin-
ema and live 
music into one 
unique expe-
rience.

“The Trip-

lets 
of 
Bel-

leville” is an 
animated 
film, 
written 

and 
directed 

by 
Sylvain 

Chomet. 
The film was 
released 
in 

2003. It tells the story of an old 
woman, Madame Souza, who 
goes on a journey to rescue her 
grandson, a Tour de France 
cyclist named Champion, from 
the French mafia.

Mark Johnson, UMS senior 

programming coordinator, was 
a part of the team that brought 
this production to the Univer-
sity.

“It’s a film that I saw in its 

original release at the Michigan 
Theater and I fell in love with,” 
Johnson said. “It’s so joyous and 
remarkable and artistic. It’s a 
universally admired piece of 
art.”

Friday’s event is a part of 

UMS’s Jazz Series. Audiences 
will get to see the film’s unique 
animation, 
accompanied 
by 

“Le Terrible Orchestre de Bel-
leville,” an on-stage eight-piece 
orchestra performing the film’s 
jazz music and sound effects 
live. The band is led by Benoit 
Charest, the film’s composer.

“It’s really an incredibly spe-

cial opportunity to host the 
composer of the film score, 
Benoit Charest, in Ann Arbor,” 
Johnson said. “It’s exciting, 
there’s a certain level of impro-
visation in the music they’re 
making. It’s performed in the 

style of ‘Le Jazz Hot,’ which is 
a style that was popularized in 
1920s Paris. It’s period music.”

Charest was nominated for a 

2003 Academy Award for Best 
Original Song for “Belleville 
Rendezvous,” a song from the 
film. In a press release, he said 
his music has been influenced by 
jazz, French singers of the ’50s 
and’60s and Frank Zappa.

“There’s two really incredible 

features in this presentation,” 
said Mallory Schirr, UMS mar-
keting and media relations coor-
dinator. “The animation is just 
beautiful, it’s a heartwarming 
story, it’s an incredible film. But 
I think one of the most unique 
experiences 
that 
you 
could 

have is being able to watch the 
film with the live score. There’s 
going to be nothing like having 
a live jazz performance right in 

front of you as you’re watching 
the film.”

Schirr also said she thinks 

this unique performance has 
many facets that will appeal to 
a variety of audience members. 

“Even if you’re not into music, 

if you’re into movies, if you’re 
into film or animation, I think 
it’s something that will resonate 
really well with people across 
the entire University,” she said.

Johnson agreed that the com-

bination of the film and the live 
music make this event a unique 
experience. 

“All of the musicians will be 

onstage, performing, visible to 
the audience, directly under-
neath the screen,” he said. “It’s 
the live film score from the cre-
ator and composer himself, with 
hand-picked musicians to play 
the parts.”

An interview with 
‘Gone Gone Beyond’

By REGAN DETWILER

Daily Arts Writer

The 
Michigan 
Daily’s 

conversation with Gone Gone 
Beyond’s 
David 
Block 
was 

as broad and wide-ranging 
as Block’s musical projects. 
His most recent project in 
futurefolk, Gone Gone Beyond 
— with Danny Musengo on 
vocals, Paul Weinfield on guitar 
and Block on production, synth 
and pretty much everything 
else — just released its first, 
self-titled album. Prior to this 
project Block has collaborated 
with countless musicians as 
The 
Human 
Experience 
— 

not only working with artists 
from all different genres and 
from all different areas of 
the world, but also producing 
his own solo work. In a mini-
documentary available on his 
website Block says his goal as a 
musician is to make electronic 
music more than just random 
bits and wobbles of sound — 
to incorporate acoustic and 
classical 
instruments 
from 

different 
time 
periods 
and 

regions 
around 
the 
world. 

Having 
played 
at 
festivals 

both local and international 
— including Electric Forest 
in 2014 — Block is planning 

on touring again soon with 
Gone Gone Beyond. In a phone 
interview with the Daily he 
shared his thoughts on Gone 
Gone Beyond, art and music 
in general and the human 
condition in an increasingly 
digital world.

The Michigan Daily: Gone 

Gone Beyond’s first album just 
came out. So I guess first of 
all you’re working with Paul 
Weinfield and Danny Musengo 
— how’d you guys meet?

David Block: Well I met 

Danny two years ago. Danny 
had worked with Paul before, 
and Paul just kind of fit in 
and now they have Gone Gone 
Beyond. Danny pays attention 
to 
intention, 
which 
is 
an 

integral part of how I create 
music.

TMD: Yeah, I was going to 

ask you about intention. Gone 
Gone Beyond seems to have a 
very specific sound, because it’s 
reminiscent of other futurefolk 
artists that are popular right 
now. What was the intention 
behind 
that? 
How 
does 

spontaneity and intention play 
into all this?

DB: My primary intention 

is to expand the hearts and 
the minds of listeners — really 
just to connect ourselves to 
our humanity through stories 
and through music. That’s the 
primary intention. It’s either a 
blessing or a curse — sometimes 
both — but I have no format with 
how I do anything. Apparently 
I have a sound — I don’t hear 
it, because everything I do 
sounds so different. I guess 
some people say they can hear 
a Human Experience track and 
tell it’s mine fairly quickly even 
if it’s some of the world music I 
do or more of the futurefolk. I 
would say that when I sit down 
with any group of players I just 
use the tools that I have. Being 
a collaborator, which is also one 
of the foundational elements of 
my work and one of my most 
powerful skills I integrate what 
I can do with what someone 
else can do. It’s a combination of 
my vision and Danny and Paul’s 
songwriting.

TMD: In reading some of 

the things you’ve written and 
listening to your music, it seems 
like spirituality is a driving 
force for you in your music. You 
worked with Hacking Arts at 
The Massachusetts Insitute of 
Technology, a project seeking 
to inspire youth to merge 
creativity and technology — 
how do you merge creative 
expression and even spirituality 
with technology?

DB: 
First, 
I 
think 
it’s 

interesting how we use the word 
‘technology.’ 
Your 
creativity 

and creative expression are 
your 
human 
technologies, 

which 
are 
exceptionally 

powerful. You are a human 
interface; your consciousness is 
an interface for reality. So that 
is a technology in itself. It has 
exceptional functionality. It has 
these things called the senses, 
which make you believe that 
you are real.

TMD: Make you think you’re 

real.

DB: Yes, it’s a very effective 

interface. Every single human 
has one. It perceives light and 
sound and touch. When I was 
at MIT some of the people 
there were showing me how 

to do some new, augmented 
technology. I’m like looking 
around the world right now. 
I’m standing right in front of 
Radio City Music Hall. I’m 
looking at, you know, 500 
people walking by and they’re 
all looking at their iPhones, 
which none of them had five 
years ago, and some of them are 
FaceTiming each other. That 
was like fuckin’ Jetson’s shit. 
That was on the Jetson’s like 
25 years ago. And now, what’s 
about to happen is they’re about 
to launch the first consumer-
level virtual reality experience. 
Basically, people are going to 
have this new technology where 
they’re going to be able to quite 
literally create worlds. It is 
about to change the entire way 
we interact with other humans 
and the world around us. And it 
will be a possible tool that will 
really fuck stuff up and possibly 
really change the way that 
we do our spirituality. You’ll 
probably have virtual gods and 
all sorts of crazy shit. So the 
game is about to change and 
that’s interesting.

TMD: Yeah, it’s exciting and 

terrifying all at the same time.

DB: 
Totally, 
yeah. 
Who 

knows? We’re either gonna 
change for the better, or we’re 
all gonna die. We’re at the 
tipping point right now. It’s 
serious and not serious. We’re in 
a very crucial time in humanity 
where I think we really need to 
be checking our intention and 
how we are interacting with 
the world, how we’re treating 
each other, what products we’re 
consuming and all of these 
things. It’s really important 
right now.

TMD: It’s absolutely crucial. 

Touching back on spirituality, 
I Google-searched Gone Gone 
Beyond 
and 
what 
showed 

up was the Heart Sutra of 
Mahayana Buddhism. Was that 
a part of your thought process 
as the three of you named this 
project and if so, why?

DB: Originally the name of 

this project was WAVS. It was 
about 
higher 
consciousness. 

Everything is just vibrating 
— sound waves, light waves, 
etc. — everything is a series of 
vibrations in space. But there’s 
another band called Wavvs and 
we were like, fuck it we don’t 
want to compete with that. 
But I had been working with 
another artist, and in this song 
I found the Heart Sutra, which 
translates to ‘gone, gone beyond, 
gone beyond the beyond. So be 
it.’ Part of what was so exciting 
about the name is the Heart 
Sutra is about the expansion of 
the heart, the expansion of the 
mind to go beyond all we can 
possibly comprehend. We want 
people to challenge reality. 
We want them to challenge 
conformity. We want them to 
push their boundaries and I do 
hope that when they Google it, 
they discover something like 
the Heart Sutra. That way, if and 
when we reach the mainstream, 
that people will be Googling 
this and they’ll find the Heart 
Sutra — and other things like it. 
I’m not a Buddhist but I do take 
a lot of the concepts there and 
appreciate them.

Gone 
Gone 
Beyond’s 
new 

self-titled album is available on 
SoundCloud for listening and on 
Bandcamp for downloading.

MUSIC INTERVIEW

Some call him 

arrogant, I call him 

confident

By SHIMA SADAGHIYANI

Daily Arts Writer

When I was six years old, I 

used to play a game in the summer 
called “Saving the Kingdom.” In 
this game, I would recruit all the 
other kids in my neighborhood 
to pretend that we were trying 
to save the kingdom we lived in 
from mysterious and dangerous 
outside forces. At least, that’s 
what I told my friends to get them 
to play. In reality, the game was a 
shameless ploy on my part to not 
have to do anything for myself 
all summer. Day in and day out, I, 
the self-proclaimed queen, would 
sit on the patio with a ragged 
crown of dried dandelions on my 
head, sipping on lemonade, while 
my friends did everything I told 
them to do, all under the guise of 
protecting the kingdom. It was 
empowering, the one summer of 
ruling my own little world.

Of course, it all came tumbling 

down when my mom caught on to 
what was occurring in her own 
backyard. My crown was thrown 
away, and I was sat down for a 
crash course on what it means to 
be humble. Under my mother’s 
watchful eye, both my ego and my 
ambitions of becoming a queen 
slowly died down.

My first Kanye West song 

was “Can’t Tell Me Nothing” 
when I was in eighth grade. My 
middle school self, completely 
contrasting 
my 
six-year-old 

self, was restrained and too shy 
to speak up in front of anyone. 
My self-esteem, much like the 
majority of other prepubescent 
kids, was at an all time low. 
However, as soon as I heard 
the unapologetic “excuse me? 
Was you saying something? / uh 
uh, you can’t tell me nothing,” 
I was hooked. The energy and 
arrogance emitting from this 
song reminded me of the little girl 
I used to be, who had endless self-
confidence and dreams to the sky 
and beyond. By the last line, “then 
you can’t tell me nothing, right?” 
I felt energized, self-assured and 
completely in control of my life. 
It was then, in eighth grade, that I 
had an important realization:

Kanye West’s narcissism gives 

me life.

Much like his celebrity persona, 

Kanye West’s music somehow 
manages to simultaneously say 
both “fuck you” and “I’m too 
important to give a fuck about 
you.” In “H.A.M” the combination 
of driving beat and vigorous, 
in-your-face 
lyrics 
brings 
a 

pulsing 
energy 
that 
nearly 

implodes the speakers. By the 
time the song gets to the chorus, 
you know both you and Kanye 
West are about to go “HAM / Hard 
As a Muthaf-cker.” Similarly, 
“Stronger” is just as empowering. 

“There’s a thousand yous, there’s 
only one of me” makes you want 
to own your originality, and the 
constant muted “make it better” 
in the background gives you 
the assertiveness to turn every 
surface you walk on into your 
own personal red carpet.

For me, Kanye West has helped 

in many different scenarios. If I 
needed pump up music before a 
big football game, I immediately 
blasted “Who Gon Stop Me.” If 
I needed a confidence booster 
before a competition, a huge 
test or an important moment in 
my life, I always put on “I am A 
God.” If I felt like I was going 
to die at the gym, I consistently 
played “No Church In The Wild” 
on repeat. On long car rides, my 
friends and I would roll down the 
windows and scream everyone’s 
favorite, “Gold Digger.” In every 
situation, Kanye West was there 
to provide some much-needed 
composure. And maybe that’s 
the reason why he is such a huge 
force in popular culture: there is a 
little part in everybody that wants 
to have that take no prisoners, 
self-absorbed confidence that his 
music inspires. 

I want Kanye West to always 

keep obnoxiously calling people 
out on Twitter and to keep 
making songs that are the musical 
equivalent of rocking an entirely 
leather outfit so that, one day in 
the future, I can hope to truly love 
myself as much as Kanye loves 
Kanye.

‘M’ looks to build off past

At leadoff banquet, 
Bakich gives nod to 
successful teams in 

program history

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

In his opening remarks at 

Friday night’s Leadoff Banquet, 
Michigan baseball coach Erik 
Bakich said, “Teams that win 
together stay together.”

These words rang true at 

the event, as several members 
of the 1953 and 1962 national 
championship 
teams 
were 

present, decades after they won 
their titles.

The quote also applies to the 

2015 Wolverines. While they 
did not win a national title, they 
did capture Michigan’s first 
Big Ten Tournament title and 
NCAA Tournament appearance 
since 2008 — a winning team by 
any measure.

And, for the most part, the 

squad has stayed together for 
the upcoming season. While the 
Wolverines lost multi-position 
star Jacob Cronenworth to the 
Major League Baseball draft, key 
contributors such as junior left-
hander/first 
baseman 
Carmen 

Benedetti, junior left-hander Brett 
Adcock, senior left-hander Evan 
Hill and sophomore shortstop 
Jake Bivens have returned.

At the banquet, Bakich also 

spoke of how each Michigan 
team has built off the Wolverines’ 
150-year history.

“Bill Mogk and Paul Fancher 

(in 1953) paved the way for 
Dick Honing, John Kerr and 
the rest of the 1962 team that’s 
back there. I mean, what an 
honor it is to be with you guys, 
to hear your stories. For you to 
share your experiences, that’s 
something that I know every one 

of our players, every member of 
Team 150, is privileged to share 
the room with you guys tonight. 
As we carve out our journey, we 
hope to follow in your footsteps.”

Many people already feel that 

last year’s Michigan team paved 
the way for the 2016 edition.

Baseball America placed the 

Wolverines 15th in its preseason 
rankings, making Michigan the 
the sole cold-weather school in 
the top 25. Consequently, the 
Wolverines are the favorites to 
win the Big Ten, a big jump from 
last year, when most projections 
had them finishing third or 
fourth in the conference.

But Michigan’s goals don’t 

end with the conclusion of 
the Big Ten Tournament. The 
Wolverines are looking to appear 

in the College World Series for 
the first time in 32 years, a feat 
they accomplished five times 
from 1978 to 1984.

One banquet guest, former 

Michigan coach Moby Benedict, 
played 
multiple 
roles 
in 

jumpstarting Michigan’s success 
during that era.

“Coach Benedict epitomizes 

Michigan 
baseball 
and 
this 

proud 
tradition 
of 
ours,” 

Bakich said. “He was the head 
coach here from 1963 to 1979 
and an assistant coach on the 
1962 national title team. The 
accolades, the championships, 
the trips to the (College) World 
Series, are all on the wall at Ray 
Fisher Stadium.”

Yet in spite of the Wolverines’ 

success 
last 
year 
and 
the 

expectations for 2016, Bakich 
insisted that accolades aren’t 
everything.

“(The 
2015 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament) 
wasn’t 
about 

getting a ring, or a trophy or a 
title — even though those are 
great things to get,” Bakich 
said. “It was more about, ‘How 
much fun can we have on a 
baseball field?’ and ‘How can 
we best represent the University 
of Michigan?’ It was an easy 
message to deliver to the team 
because we’ve talked about it all 
the time.”

Michigan’s senior captains, 

Hill and catcher Domenic Jamett, 
echoed Bakich’s sentiment.

“There’s 
a 
quote 
in 
the 

bulletin board in the nutrition 
lounge from the 1953 national 
championship 
team,” 
Jamett 

said. “It reads, ‘We are proud 
by the high standards that are 
set and the successes that we 
achieved. They’ve inspired us 
to perform with confidence and 
behave responsibly.’ I think 
that’s a quote that not only 
summarizes that team, but also 
our program.”

The Wolverines will have 

their first chance to prove 
that they are deserving of the 
preseason praise this weekend, 
with a four-game series against 
Canisius. It is part of a stretch 
of 19 games on the road for 
Michigan before it returns home 
to face University of Illinois at 
Chicago on March 25.

“I’m excited for what’s in 

store for Team 150 as we dig our 
toes into opening day in a week,” 
Hill said. “I’m honored to share 
the field with these guys I call 
my brothers.”

The sentiment of “teams that 

win together stay together” rang 
true for the 1953 and 1962 squads. 
The 2016 Wolverines will have 
to wait and see if they will be 
remembered as a squad that won 
together and stayed together.

Racine: A lonely 
difference maker
O

n road trips, Steve 
Racine always stays 
alone. It’s been that way 

since his freshman year.

The 

Michigan 
hockey 
coaching 
staff never 
told the 
senior 
goaltender 
why he gets 
his own 
room in the 
team hotel, 
but Racine has a guess.

“I think (coach Red 

Berenson) just wants me to 
focus more,” Racine said. 
“Doctor’s orders.”

In any case, Berenson’s plan 

is finally working.

After three and a half 

years, Racine is playing the 
best hockey he ever has in a 
Michigan uniform. Berenson 
named him the team’s bona 
fide starter more than three 
months ago. For his last six 
games, he boasts a .931 save 
percentage, a career high for 
any stretch over five games 
that he has played.

And this past weekend, 

he was the 
only reason 
Michigan 
managed 
to escape 
Madison with 
five points, 
rather than 
three. In 
Saturday’s 
contest 
against 
Wisconsin, the Wolverines 
won in a shootout, despite 
surrendering four goals.

“You should’ve seen him at 

Wisconsin,” Berenson said. 
“He stood on his head, and we 
had no business winning the 
game based on the chances we 
gave up.

“That was his best game of 

the year.”

It’s odd that Berenson would 

call Racine’s best game of the 
year one in which he let in four 
goals. But he’s right.

Racine handled 50 shots in 

that game. He made sprawling 
kick saves and swooping glove 
saves on countless Wisconsin 
3-on-1 opportunities. They were 
grade-A chances, and goals 
Michigan fans wouldn’t shake 
their heads at if Racine were to 
let any of those pucks in.

“We haven’t done a great job 

helping him out all year,” said 
junior forward Tyler Motte. 
“It’s something we’re focusing 
on — the D-zone and doing our 
best to help him out.”

Motte referenced the 

defensive lapses that don’t seem 
to go away, no matter how many 
times the players have stressed 
they are working on them.

You don’t have to dig deep 

in the history books to see that 
Michigan has dealt with this 
before. Just look to last season.

The Wolverines finished 

the year with the nation’s 
best offense, yet ranked in the 
bottom half in team defense. 
What did that get them?

Nothing.
Fast-forward eight months, 

and now you have a strikingly 
similar Michigan team. The 
Wolverines average 4.78 
goals per game — nearing 
Quinnipiac’s record of 5.42 
goals per game, which was set 
in 1999.

However, like a year ago, the 

Wolverines allow 3.00 goals 
per game, which ranks in the 
bottom half of the NCAA.

But that’s no longer because 

of a lack of solid goaltending.

“I’m still lamenting our 

goals-against,” Berenson said. 
“It’s not our goalies. A couple 
years ago, we would’ve said our 
goalie needed to play better, 
but our goalies have given us 
a shot.”

A big part of that is the 

addition of Steve Shields, a 
former Wolverine great, as 
goaltending coach. Whereas 
Racine used to have a goalie 
coach just twice a week, he now 
has one around every day to 
help fine-tune even the smallest 

aspects of his 
game.

In Friday’s 

4-1 win over 
Wisconsin, 
Racine 
allowed one 
goal that 
shouldn’t 
have counted 
— officials 
failed to 

notice the puck slid in through 
the side of the net. But Shields 
still found a way to coach 
Racine about that moment.

“Working with Steve allows 

me to know exactly what I need 
to do and to learn what I’m 
doing when I am playing my 
best,” Racine said. “We found 
a direct correlation to how I’ve 
been practicing leading into 
games, and working harder is 
just giving me the foundation to 
have good weekends.

“I tell him all the time about 

how happy I am to have him 
here. He understands exactly 
what I need to do to play my 
best. The way I feel when I am 
playing well, he knows that 
exactly and can tap into that 
and help me to play my best.”

It has certainly showed in 

Racine’s last 12 games as the 
starter — the longest starting 
stretch of his Michigan career. 
He has given his team a chance 
in each of those games.

So when the Wolverines hit 

the road for the postseason, and 
likely the NCAA Tournament, 
two things are for certain: 
Racine will show up as he has 
all year, and he’ll have his own 
hotel room — doctor’s orders.

Michigan heads 
to College Park

By CHRIS CROWDER

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team will have its 
second crack at pulling off an 
improbable 
upset 
Wednesday, 
when 
the 

Wolverines 
head 
to 

College Park 
to face No. 6 
Maryland.

In 
the 

two 
squads’ 

matchup 
in 

Ann 
Arbor 

on Jan. 14, 
Michigan 
nearly came 
out with the win. The Wolverines 
(7-7 Big Ten, 15-10 overall) came 
into the fourth quarter down by 
just three with the home crowd 
fueling the comeback. But with 
their two post players, freshman 
center Hallie Thome and senior 
forward Kelsey Mitchell, in foul 
trouble, the taller Terrapins 
outrebounded Michigan by 10 
and found easier baskets in the 
paint to seal a 74-67 win.

At 
the 
time, 
sophomore 

guard Katelynn Flaherty said 
the Wolverines could still win 
the Big Ten, as they were just 
five games into the 18-game 
conference schedule. After the 
Maryland game, Michigan was 
2-3 in conference play. Now in 
ninth place in the conference 
with just four games to go, the 
goal of winning the Big Ten is 
unattainable. And at this point 
in the season, a win against the 
Terrapins in Maryland will be 
just as difficult to pull off.

Maryland (12-2, 23-3) has lost 

to just two teams this season — 
No. 5 Ohio State (twice) and No. 
1 Connecticut. All three losses 
have come by single digits, proof 
that the Terrapins deserve to be 
regarded as one of the best teams 
in the nation and are capable of 
staying close to elite teams.

However, Maryland is coming 

off a game in which it didn’t play 
its best. It beat Northwestern — 
a preseason Big Ten darkhorse 
now 3-11 in the conference — by 
just nine. The Terrapins aren’t 
invincible, but they are tough to 
beat, even if they don’t play their 
best game.

“Maryland is an incredible 

team, 
and 
(they) 
have 
a 

tremendous 
program,” 
said 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico 
in 
her 
weekly 
radio 

appearance with WTKA on 
Tuesday. “They’re led by a guard 
(Shatori 
Walker-Kimbrough) 

who scored 41 the other night 
and then 35. We might have to 
change the lineup again, because 
we’ve been playing small to 
match up on rebounds.”

For Michigan to pull off 

the upset this time around, 
it will need to play one of its 
best games of the season. In 
its earlier matchup against 
Maryland, the game was in 
the Wolverines’ grasp. If the 
Wolverines can stay out of foul 
trouble, allowing their taller 
players to get more rebounds, 
they might have a chance.

But again, this is a different 

atmosphere. 
The 
Terrapins 

boast one of the best home 
crowds 
in 
women’s 
college 

basketball and have lost only 
once at home this season.

The 
Wolverines 
are 
also 

clinging to hopes of a berth to the 
NCAA Tournament. A victory 
against the Terrapins would be 
the resume builder they need 
in order to have a shot. The 
following three games come 
against teams behind or tied with 
them in the Big Ten standings.

Winning on Wednesday may 

give Michigan the momentum 
to make the Big Dance for the 
first time since 2013. After all, 
the Wolverines have won three 
straight Big Ten games for the 
first time since that season.

“We don’t want the season to be 

over, so it’s a process to get there 
every day,” Barnes Arico said.

despite sluggish start

Wolverines start 

winter with 

13th-place finish in 

Puerto Rico

By BILLY STAMPFL

Daily Sports Writer

After a break of nearly four 

months, the Michigan women’s 
golf team returned to action 
Sunday at the Lady Puerto 
Rico Classic. In a tournament 
that included 16 teams, the 
Wolverines 
settled 
for 
13th 

place after recording a score of 
916 — 52 strokes over par and 49 
behind champion Georgia.

Some may find reason to be 

discouraged by a disappointing 
finish on Tuesday, especially 
after a fourth-place showing 
to conclude the fall season 
in October at the Las Vegas 
Collegiate 
Showdown. 
But 

Michigan coach Jan Dowling 
voiced 
few 

serious 
concerns 
regarding her 
team’s play in 
Puerto Rico.

“Everyone 

had things to 
work on over 
the 
winter,” 

Dowling said. 
“It was really 
cool to watch 
them integrate those things 
into their games this weekend. 
We’re going to build on that and 
continue to improve.”

Dowling’s positivity may be 

a result of her understanding 
that a long break from outdoor 
play 
— 
coupled 
with 
the 

“discomforting” 
feeling 
of 

competing on grass again — 
makes returning to competition 
difficult for her players.

Despite some adversity, senior 

Catherine 
Peters 
had 
little 

trouble shaking the rust from 
winter, as she tied for 18th with 
a team-best score of 223. Peters 
attributed her hot start to the 

spring campaign to her focus on 
improving key weaknesses over 
the past three months.

“I 
honestly 
just 
worked 

on my putting,” Peters said. 
“I’m pretty technical with my 
swing, so I don’t change it very 
often, but my putting needed 
some work.”

Much of Michigan’s fate this 

season will be decided based 
on offseason training. Finding 
motivation over the winter to 
improve even more wasn’t hard 
for the Wolverines after a strong 
finish to the fall season.

“This team is intrinsically 

motivated 
to 
begin 
with,” 

Dowling said. “But (the Las 
Vegas 
Showdown) 
definitely 

added fuel to our fire to continue 
to show what we’re capable of 
this year.”

As the lone Wolverine senior, 

Peters has embraced her role as 
unofficial captain on a young 
squad. On a roster with five 
underclassmen out of the seven 
golfers in all, she realizes 

she 
has 
no 

choice 
but 

to set a good 
example.

“I 
know 

that the other 
girls look up to 
me, especially 
in 
terms 
of 

hard 
work 

and 
setting 

the pace for 
practice 
and 

workouts,” Peters said. “I have 
to make sure I always have a 
positive attitude.”

Behind the encouragement 

of Dowling and the leadership 
of Peters, Michigan can only 
improve as they return from 
Puerto Rico. They’ll travel south 
again in two weeks to compete 
in the Hurricane Invitational in 
Miami, hoping to recover from 
the rocky start and build on 
offseason progress.

“Overall, we showed a lot of 

great signs this week,” Dowling 
said. “The more and more we’re 
competing, the better we’re 
going to get.”

“Everyone had 
things to work 

on over the 

winter.”

8A — Wednesday, February 17, 2016
Sports
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

in a 61-56 win against Purdue. 
LeVert was expected to play in 
his final regular-season visit to 
his home state but was instead 
forced to watch his former high 
school 
teammate, 
Jae’Sean 

Tate, account for the margin of 
victory and then some with a 
13-point effort.

Beilein 

reiterated 
after the game 
that 
“pain 

is 
(LeVert’s) 

guide,” 
and 

said 
LeVert 

was too sore 
to practice in 
the 
wake 
of 

the 11 minutes 
he 
played 

against 
the 

Boilermakers. The Wolverines 
had hoped the two days between 
the Purdue win and the trip to 
Columbus would have allowed 
for some sort of continuity, but 
they found no such luck, as 

LeVert once again was unable to 
play after giving it a try during 
shootaround earlier in the day.

“There’s been an effect (from 

the absences of) him and Spike 
all year,” Beilein said, asked if 
LeVert’s absence changed his 
game plan. “No. Ohio State had an 
effect on our game plan today.”

Michigan fell into a hole with 

Abdur-Rahkman on the bench, 
and its foul troubles came back 
with a vengeance in the second 

half. 
The 

Wolverines 
recorded 
six 
team 

fouls 
in 
the 

period’s 
first 

five 
minutes, 

including 
two 
in 
a 

four-second 
stretch 
from 

sophomore 
guard Aubrey 

Dawkins. Redshirt sophomore 
guard Duncan Robinson and 
Dawkins also finished with four 
fouls apiece, limiting Beilein’s 
options in the game’s final 
stretch.

It may not have mattered, 

as Michigan’s shooters went 
a 
combined 
5-for-24 
from 

3-point range, including a 1-for-
5 performance from Robinson, 
who has struggled as of late.

Junior 
forward 
Mark 

Donnal proved Michigan’s only 
consistent source of scoring, as 
Michigan’s 
backcourt 
juniors 

— forward Zak Irvin and guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. — shot a 
combined 10-for-28 from the 
field. Donnal did well to score 
in the paint and finished with 
17 points, but his performance 
wasn’t nearly enough as the 
Wolverines’ 
perimeter-centric 

offense sputtered around the 
3-point arc. Irvin finished with 
15 and Walton finished with 13.

The 
loss 
cuts 
deep 
into 

the 
Wolverines’ 
margin 
for 

error as they vie for an NCAA 
Tournament bid.

With the loss, Michigan likely 

needs a win at home against 
Northwestern as well as one out 
of three versus No. 4 Iowa, at No. 
6 Maryland and at Wisconsin to 
be secure in its standing for the 
68-member field.

Fatigue plagues Michigan in Columbus

Foul trouble, LeVert 
injury force Walton, 

Irvin to play 75 
total minutes

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

COLUMBUS — Down the 

home stretch of the Big Ten 
men’s basketball season, it seems 
averaging nearly 36 minutes 
per conference game has finally 
caught up with junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. and junior 
forward Zak Irvin.

Walton already fell victim to a 

cold spell just three days ago in 
Michigan’s victory over No. 18 
Purdue, a game in which Irvin 
played the hero with 22 points 
and the go-ahead basket. But 
Tuesday at Ohio State, neither 
player could get a rhythm going, 
and each finished 5-for-14 from 
the floor in the 76-66 loss.

The Wolverines’ two on-court 

leaders did reach double-digit 
scoring 
with 

some 
late 

baskets in the 
second 
half, 

and 
junior 

forward Mark 
Donnal tallied 
a 
team-high 

17 
points 
of 

his own. But 
Michigan consistently struggled 
to keep up with the Buckeyes, 
who made 54 percent of their 
shots and caused the Wolverines 
to commit several quick fouls, 
especially in the second half, 
while also holding them to 
39-percent shooting.

“Derrick was still fatigued from 

the Minnesota game on Saturday, 
and now (he had to) go back (and 
play) again,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “They did almost 
nothing on Sunday, so we could 
really get some rest for them, 
but there’s a lot of minutes being 
logged out there.”

Continuing a common theme 

from 
Michigan’s 
losses 
this 

season, the Wolverines found 
themselves unable to solve an 
opposing defense that imposed 
its length on them, forcing 
them to take low-percentage, 
contested shots. Walton and 
sophomore 
guard 
Duncan 

Robinson 
— 
two 
generally 

prolific 3-point shooters — shot 
just 2-for-12 combined from 
beyond the arc, and tired legs 
certainly didn’t help.

“When an elite shooter like 

Derrick 
goes 
2-for-something 

the last couple games, it’s a bad 
number,” Beilein said. “Duncan as 
well. Ohio State’s defense is really 
good. We’ve played four or five 
teams in this league (like that).”

The most tangible evidence of 

Michigan’s fatigue didn’t even 
come from the players on the 
floor — it came from the notable 
face missing.

Senior guard Caris LeVert, 

who made his return and played 
11 minutes Saturday after being 
sidelined for six weeks with a 
lower-left leg injury, was unable 

to 
practice 

yesterday after 
feeling 
sore, 

leaving him out 
of the lineup 
for 
Tuesday’s 

game. 
Beilein 

declined 
to 
specify 

whether 
it 

was the injury flaring up or just 
general soreness; LeVert hinted 
toward the latter when he spoke 
with reporters Monday.

Slowly working LeVert back 

into the lineup was supposed 
to be a major focus for Beilein 
over the final few games of the 
regular season, but with so 
much uncertainty surrounding 
his status, the Wolverines have 
been unable to settle on a plan of 
attack or establish clear depth in 
the rotation.

“We were very hopeful that 

with those two days in between, 
we’d be able to do some things to 

give us some type of continuity of 
what we’re going to run against 
these guys in the future,” Beilein 
said. “We couldn’t dummy with 
(LeVert) or anything yesterday, 
just because we want to be 
so cautious knowing we have 
another game Sunday.”

And that game Sunday won’t 

be a picnic either — Michigan 
will travel to College Park to face 
No. 6 Maryland, which has only 
lost one home game this season 
despite being upset in Ann Arbor 
in January.

Having a few more days off 

should benefit the exhausted 
Michigan 
team, 
but 
no 

matter what Beilein says, the 
Wolverines themselves refuse 
to acknowledge their weariness 
down the stretch as they battle 
for an NCAA Tournament berth.

“I think every team goes 

through this, three games in seven 
days,” Irvin said. “I don’t really 
want to use fatigue as an excuse.”

Wednesday, February 17, 2016 / The Statement

A

t a storytelling on campus a few months ago, my 
blood was boiling. A girl around my age was read-
ing a piece on feminism, but she was highlight-

ing the reasons why her desire to lead made her “not a 
woman.” She said she was defying gender norms with 
her desire to succeed; she was acting like a man when she 
accessed success. “I’m not a woman when I say I want to 
be president of the United States.”

Perhaps what she meant was that people would not 

associate her actions as being female when she acts this 
way. But it made me uncomfortable. She was shaming her 
identity rather than celebrating it.

Why are we women always trying to shed our feminin-

ity? Why are success and being female at odds? Why are 
we told to “grow some balls” when we want to succeed? Is 
there anything good about being a woman?

Advice for women in the workplace typically empha-

sizes the need to be more assertive. Speak up in meetings. 
Negotiate for a raise. Brag. Become male, essentially. And 
while that’s necessary for survival, at a certain point we’re 
becoming self-hating women. We don’t want to have any 
feminine traits.

Moreover, when I’m told to act like a man, I wonder if 

men are ever told to act like a woman — a better listener, 
creative, generally not socially inept — or if it’s just women 
who should change themselves.

Take nursing and engineering — both dominated by one 

gender, and both rapidly growing professions. The tribu-
lations of being a woman in the sphere of engineering are 
a common topic of discussion. And rightly so — women in 
engineering have to face, to be brief, a whole fucking lot 
of shit. To respond to that problem, a slew of nonprofits, 
politicians and companies are focused on getting women 
into tech. 

But why don’t we want more male nurses?
The numbers prove that nursing is growing more quick-

ly than software, in both number of jobs and salary. Home 
health care services and outpatient care services are pro-
jected to lead salary growth in America, respectively, at 
4.8 percent and 4.1 percent in the next decade. The first 
software jobs are further down the list — tech consulting 
services and software publishing will grow at just over 2 
percent in the next decade.

Only 9.4 percent of nurses are men. People are con-

cerned that women aren’t encouraged to be logical and 
interested in science, but no one seems to care that many 
men lack the empathy and intelligence necessary to 
become a nurse. My move to take a programming class my 
freshman year was lauded as some sort of bold feminist 
move that would be rewarded with a great internship, but 
no one seems excited about men in the School of Nurs-
ing — despite the stability and excellent expectations for 
growth that field promises.

I’m supposed to take programming courses not because 

it’s a growing industry, but because it’s a male-dominated 
one. If that wasn’t the reason, then why don’t we see more 
campaigns to get men involved in nursing?

We’re championing a wrong sort of gender equality. 

Certain brands of feminism have become about dropping 
everything womanly just to become male. It’s gotten to 
the point where completely neutral behaviors are seen as 
negative, solely because young women overwhelmingly 
have them. It’s bad to be emotional simply because it’s bad 
to be a woman, and industries like education, nursing and 
publishing, which are overwhelmingly female, aren’t pri-
oritized due to their demographic makeup.

***

I cried at my internship last summer. Hunched over my 

desk, hiding my face, drops fell off my face onto my desk 
after one of my bosses was short with me in front of our 
entire office. This was bad, but thankfully no one noticed.

I was too ashamed to tell anyone, especially my mom 

and especially my female friends. I committed the big-
gest vice — the number one way a woman can lose respect 
from everyone around her in the workplace. At 20, I had 
already failed at the office gymnastics I’m required to do 
to avoid being slapped with the label of “emotional.”

I’m sick of being ashamed that I cried. I’m sick of being 

scared that I wear skirts too often, or that I absentmind-
edly touch my hair. None of these actions are inherently 
bad, save for the fact that women tend to do them.

When I enter the workforce, I certainly intend to nego-

tiate my salary and state my opinions in meetings. Not 
because I’m tapping into some secret Y chromosome 
within me, but because I’m very happily being a socially 
savvy, creative and intelligent woman.

hen I was a senior in high school, I participat-
ed in a young women’s leadership workshop 
run by the large consulting firm McKinsey & 

Company. At our first event, we were told to introduce 
ourselves and share something we exceptional at. There 
was a catch though: we weren’t allowed to attribute our 
successes to anyone but ourselves.

It seemed like a simple task at first, but after just two 

or three introductions, I realized the icebreaker would 
take longer than I had imagined. Many girls subcon-
sciously modified their accomplishments with phrases 
like “people tell me I’m good at” or “I guess I’m okay at” 
and, upon each sign of hesitation, the facilitator would 
instruct them to start over. It was as if each girl was 
embarrassed to take ownership over her own varsity let-
ters, Model U.N. awards or artistic achievements. I was 
no exception.

Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer of Facebook 

and author of Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to 
Lead, has identified the tendency of women to underes-
timate their own abilities as a key factor in the presence 
and persistence of the modern-day glass ceiling.

A September 2015 report by Mckinsey and LeanIn.Org 

surveyed 118 companies with roughly 30,000 employees 
each in an effort to research the current state of women 
in corporate America. The study found that women are 
underrepresented at every corporate level, with the 
greatest disparity at senior leadership levels. A 2003 
Carnegie Mellon University study found that, of young 
adults entering the workforce out of college, 57 percent 
of males negotiated their starting salaries compared 
to just 7 percent of women. In short: women are doing 
amazing things, but they won’t demand credit for it.

For some reason, women think their work and their 

accomplishments are somehow less deserving of recog-
nition than that of their male counterparts. Tradition-
ally, I’ve attributed corporate America’s gender gap to a 
history of sexism and social barriers both in the office 
and at home. But what if women aren’t achieving their 
goals largely because of themselves? 

What bothers me the most about this observation 

is that it seems uncomfortably accurate. I constantly 
remind myself and anyone who disagrees that I get good 
grades because I study for hours on end– not because 

I’m smart. I’m good at writing because I revise each 
sentence, word and comma placement countless times 
before hitting “print;” not because I’m a good writer. And 
no matter how prepared I am for an exam, I continue to 
tell the guy in my class who asks me how I feel about it 
directly afterward that “I’m not sure.” What gets to me is 
that I really am not sure, and apparently so are my peers.

Sitting in that office building, I was surrounded by 

impressive girls from all over New Jersey– each intense-
ly driven and bound for elite colleges and universities. 
But when prompted to take ownership over our own 
achievements, many of us automatically attributed them 
to other people.

I don’t know why women are more likely than men 

to tell themselves they aren’t good enough, they don’t 
deserve a promotion and that their successes are only 
a product of the help they receive from those around 
them. Looking around the room, I remember thinking to 
myself how each girl was undoubtedly bound for a suc-
cessful career in business, government, medicine etc. 
But what if our own reluctance to identify and demand 
recognition for our strengths is the thickest glass stand-
ing in the way of our professional goals?

Telemachus: 8:11 a.m.
The epic begins with a ringing phone.
I pull my pink comforter off of my body, climb 

out of bed and answer the phone. I open my front 
door to find Kelli, a fellow “Ulysses” reader. Kelli 
has dark hair, a nose ring and a wide smile. I 
realize I’ve never actually had a conversation 
with her.

For our final exam in John Whittier-

Ferguson’s class on James Joyce, we will be 
reading all of Joyce’s “Ulysses” aloud. I offered 
my apartment as a starting location because the 
novel opens in a tower, and I live on the 10th 
floor. It’s not Dublin, but I do have a pretty good 
view of the Diag.

Kelli and I make awkward small talk in my 

kitchen until Yardain walks in, unannounced. 
Yardain was one of my first friends freshman 
year, and now, in the middle of our senior year, 
our relationship has an easy familiarity. Proving 
this point, he immediately begins cracking eggs 
into a large glass measuring bowl. Watching 
him, I realize I’ve made my first error of the day.

“Oh no!” I say. “I don’t have olive oil.”
“It’s fine,” Yardain says. “It’ll be fine.”
I don’t listen. I played a key part in organizing 

our group’s reading, and I can’t shake the feeling 
that I’m going to mess it up somehow.

I race downstairs, walk to 7-Eleven and 

buy some spray oil. I find that the weather is 
unseasonably warm for mid-December. When I 
get back, Yardain delegates me to the vegetables. 
I begin chopping up onions, mushrooms and red 
peppers as group members file in. There are 12 
of us in total.

My apartment is small, and soon every chair 

is accounted for. Three people sit at the kitchen 
counter, four on the couches and two in desk 
chairs I stole from bedrooms.

David joins Yardain and I behind the kitchen 

counter. David is the English major version of a 
class clown. In class, he openly begins questions 
with, “So, say I haven’t done the reading…” We 
all love him, including John, our professor. 
Actually, I think John loves him most.

David begins making bacon, which he picked 

out when we went grocery shopping yesterday. 
He reminds me a bit of Leopold Bloom, the 
protagonist of “Ulysses.” Both eat pork for 
breakfast even though they are Jewish. Both are 
unconquered heroes.

The premise of “Ulysses” is this: Bloom 

walks around Dublin, Ireland for an entire day. 
He believes his wife, Molly, is cheating on him 
at home and refuses to return until late into 
the night. We plan to mirror Bloom’s progress. 
We’re going to walk all over Ann Arbor as we 
read, trying to spend each chapter somewhere 
similar to where Bloom was in Dublin.

All 18 chapters of “Ulysses” are named after 

and based on chapters in Homer’s “Odyssey.” 
“Ulysses” is a modern-day epic.

At some point in the morning, someone 

begins reading.

Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the 

stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a 
mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressing 
gown, ungirdled, was sustained gently behind 
him by the mild morning air.

The reading progresses smoothly from one 

person to another. The sound mixes with the 
sizzling of the bacon and the pouring of coffee. It 
all feels calming, like a bedtime story.

Some people are better readers than others. 

One group member, Nick, is particularly 
fantastic. It seems he was born to read “Ulysses” 
aloud.

As Nick reads, I pack my backpack. 

Throughout the day, Bloom keeps with him a bar 
of lemon soap and a crumpled up letter. I pack 
smarter, albeit nearly as light: a zip-lock bag of 
goldfish, a phone charger and a small notebook.

We finish the first two chapters, which are 

relatively short, and everyone begins to cheer.

“Shut up and read,” David exclaims.
And we do. Someone begins reading the third 

chapter as we all stand up and put our coats on.

It is time to leave my island behind. I lock the 

door behind me and feel an ocean of uncertainty 
ahead of me. Who will I be when I return?

English Professor John Whittier-Ferguson is 

sitting in his office eating a bagel with cheese.

John is tall, thin and undeniably heroic. He is 

dressed in a royal blue button-down paired with 
dark wash jeans.

Every two years, on average, John teaches a 

course devoted almost entirely to “Ulysses.” In 
the class, which I took in my Fall 2015 semester, 
we spent the first five weeks with Joyce’s 
“Dubliners” and “A Portrait of the Artist as a 
Young Man,” then dedicated a full nine weeks to 
“Ulysses.”

At the end of the course, students get together 

in groups and read “Ulysses” aloud from start 
to finish. Though optional, the reading stands 
in place of a final exam. Students who don’t 
participate take a written final that involves 
passage identification.

I ask John how the reading is graded.
“Everyone gets an A,” he says. “It’s so much 

harder than the exam.”

John’s office is a tribute to Joyce. The 

bookshelves are lined with secondary texts, like 
“Ulysses Annotated” and a full set of “Finnegans 
Wake” encyclopedias.

“Some books have these sort of cultish things 

around them and this is one of them,” John says 
of “Ulysses.”

He’s not wrong. “Ulysses” takes place on 

June 16, 1904, a day that has now been dubbed 
“Bloomsday,” in honor of Leopold Bloom. All 
over the world, in places from Canada to Croatia, 
people honor the book by reading it aloud, often 
in marathon readings like ours.

Bloomsday began in Dublin in 1954. The 

University’s tradition began 37 years later, in 
1991. John was just out of graduate school at 
Princeton University, and it was his first year 
teaching “Ulysses.” Three students — Ethan 
Goodman, Jessamyn Hatcher and David Zaft — 
floated the idea of a reading instead of a final.

“Like so many great things, it’s student-led 

and student-originated,” John says, modestly.

John is the type of professor who keeps in 

touch with his students after they graduate. 
Every time he mentions a “Ulysses” veteran, 
he follows their name with what they are doing 
now. Things like, “He went into the Peace 
Corps,” or “He’s back in town, applying for an 
MFA.”

I wonder, hopefully, if I will be one of these 

students in 10 years.

Proteus: 9:21 a.m.
We don’t want to split up, so all 12 of us crowd 

into one of my building’s two tiny elevators. The 
elevator travels two floors down then opens 
again. A boy stands still for a moment before 
entering.

“Is the other elevator broken?” he asks, 

confused as to why there are so many of us.

“Sure,” I tell him.
We reach the first floor and step out, like 

clowns getting out of a car. David reads as we 
walk through the Diag. His reading is quick, and 

An 

Ann Arbor 
Odyssey

it will only get quicker throughout the day. He is 
the fastest reader out of all of us.

It’s still early enough that the campus is 

pretty much deserted, and I feel peaceful as we 
walk. Soon, I’ll be graduating, leaving all of this 
behind. It feels right that I’m experiencing Ann 
Arbor, an old place, in a new way.

We end up in Mason Hall, sitting on the tiled 

floor with our books on our laps as students 
hurry past us, yawning on their way to their 10 
a.m. classes. Now, Yardain is reading. He keeps 
his voice deep and puts extra stress on every 
third word.

A wayward freshman approaches our group.
“Are you guys registering?” he asks.
“No,” we all chant in unison. He walks away, 

embarrassed.

As chapter three ends, I run upstairs to turn 

in a final paper for an English class. I hand it to 
my GSI, Dory, then tell her I can’t stay for our 
discussion, because I need to get back to my 
“Ulysses” reading. She doesn’t mind.

“I’ve heard of that before,” she says. “That is 

so cool!”

***

Calling Ethan Goodman, I feel as though I’m 

about to talk to a famous person. Twenty-five 
years ago, this man was ambitious enough to 
convince his English class to read all of “Ulysses” 
aloud. He now works at an important-sounding 
New York law firm.

Though John takes no credit for the creation 

of the reading, Ethan says John’s teaching style 
played a crucial part.

“The way John ran the class, which was really 

a collaborative discussion group more than 
anything else, seemed to naturally lend itself to 
a capstone that was more than sitting in a room 
and writing in a blue book,” Ethan says. 

I can stand behind this — John’s classroom 

does not feel like a place where there is a right 
answer. Rather than lecture at his students, 
John helps us to dig deeper into passages that 
interest us, leading us to unlock key parts of the 
text that may be difficult to access. A blue book 
exam does not seem the best way to assess how 
far a student has come with the text. 

Ethan and his classmates did the reading on 

half-Bloomsday — so December 16, 1991. At that 
point, students hadn’t yet begun to travel around 
Ann Arbor, trying to match Bloom’s path in 
Dublin.

“Back then it was all in one place,” Ethan tells 

me.

The things Ethan says about John’s class, 

“Ulysses” and Ann Arbor sound almost too 
familiar. It’s as if nothing has changed in all of 
these intervening years.

I ask Ethan how “Ulysses” has affected him 

over the years. It feels like I am about to hear my 
future.

“It seems to reveal itself in various ways 

depending on where you are in your life,” he 
says. “When you’re a student … it can be one 
thing, but later on, when you pick it back up, 
you’re going to see certain things in a whole 
different light just because you will have gained 
some life experience.”

***

Lestrygonians: 1:10 p.m.
A few chapters later, we’re all starving. In four 

hours, we trek all over campus. From Mason Hall 
we go to the cemetery on Observatory, where 
David sits on a grave and Yardain says, simply, 
“Don’t do that.” Then, we retrace our steps back 

to the Student Publications Building, where we 
all have chairs for the first time in a while.

Now, we’re at a long, Harry Potter-esque table 

in Pizza House, waiting for our food. It’s a Friday 
afternoon and the restaurant is predictably 
empty. Music plays overhead, but it can’t 
compete with the sound of us reading.

The 
waitress 
approaches 
and 
seems 

unflustered by our open books. It’s as if people 
come in here reading “Ulysses” every day. 
Honestly, I’m sure she’s seen weirder. We order 
two large pizzas — one vegetable, for non-
carnivores like myself, and one pepperoni.

Bloom is also eating lunch. A Gorgonzola 

cheese sandwich. An interesting choice for a 
man who ate pork kidneys for breakfast. My 
vegetarian pizza makes me feel closer to him. 
Greaseabloom.

There’s so much in “Ulysses” I’ll never get. 

Having studied the book for three decades, John 
recognizes this. He does not expect his students 
to understand the entire book. Part of the beauty 
of the marathon reading is that group members 
all come with their own backgrounds, and we all 
have certain parts we understand best.

“It’s hard to think of a book that’s harder to 

read in a college assembly of people, because it’s 
very hard to do on your own, even with good 
notes and all the best will in the world,” John 
says. “It’s one of those things that it really helps 
to be a part of a group, encouraging everybody 
together.”

At Pizza House, I sit next to Nick, the one 

who’s excellent at reading aloud. It turns out 
Nick has even more secret skills: He is a die-
hard Shakespeare fan. Lucky for me, I have been 
in the market for a Shakespeare fan. Joyce’s 
references to Shakespeare are nearly constant.

Nick begins to explain a theory about 

Hamlet that Joyce presents in “Ulysses”. When 
he finishes, I still don’t really get it, but I’m 
captivated anyway. Here I am, in Pizza House, 
reading “Ulysses” aloud and discussing theories 
on “Hamlet.” This, I think, this is the reason I 
became an English major.

***

John has a dream that, he admits, will never 

be realized. He imagines all of the generations 
of “Ulysses” marathon-readers will one day all 
stand in a room together, talking about the book.

In writing this article, I have sort of helped 

fulfill John’s dream. I keep reaching out to 
former readers, reminding them that they did 
this amazing, insane thing and I did it, too. We 
might be in completely different places in our 
lives, but we all have one thing in common: an 
almost unhealthy obsession with Joyce.

I have already talked to Ethan, a member of 

the first generation of readers. Next, I call Tom 
McBrien, who is of the most recent generation 
besides mine and a former Daily Copy Chief. 
He did the reading in the Winter 2015 semester. 
Though Tom and I are much closer together in 
years, his observations about the reading are 
completely in line with Ethan’s.

Tom gives a description of the reading 

that leaves me laughing out loud and nodding 
emphatically, though he can’t see me.

“It was like an English major hazing,” he says, 

seriously.

Like me, Tom did the reading in his 

senior year. He says, at the time he did it, the 
opportunity to wander all over Ann Arbor was 
particularly special. He knew that his time with 
these places was coming to an end.

“It’s kind of an emotional thing going to 

all these different places in Ann Arbor that 
I’ve been before, but meshing them with this 
incredible work of literature,” Tom tells me. “It 
became part of how I see the city.”

Like many of us, Tom’s experience with 

“Ulysses” has affected the way he sees the world. 
He says he’s found that “Ulysses” has this way of 
mirroring life in a way that’s almost spooky.

“There are so many things in it that are 

unforgettable and these things keep cropping 
up,” he says. “I don’t know what kind of wizard 
James Joyce was, but he found the most amazing 
way to capture so much of life in that book.”

***

Sirens: 4:32 p.m.
Eight hours in, the rhythm of the book 

becomes the rhythm of my thoughts. My 
thoughts 
are 
wandering. 
My 
wandering 

thoughts.

“Ulysses,” as a book, has a liveliness to it. 

The book presents thoughts and ideas that can’t 
be attributed to any character. It is, at turns, 
musical or mocking or angry or tired or sad.

“Sirens” does not abide by the laws of 

narrative, but by the laws of music. It has a 
prelude. It repeats words just for the sake of 
sound, and has random interludes everywhere. 

When we reach the prelude of Sirens, we 

are all standing on an Ann Street sidewalk. We 
gather in a circle and hold our books into the 
middle like hands in a cheer. We take turns 
reading single lines. It is windy with a slight chill. 
The words are a spirit, a possession jumping 
from person to person.

Bronze 
by 
gold 
heard 
the 
hoofirons, 

steelyringing.

Imperthnthn thnthnthn.
Chips, picking chips off rocky thumbnail, chips.
The thing about these lines is they start to 

make sense when read aloud. Hearing them, 
I realize that Joyce heard them, too. That a 
chapter relying on sound can’t make full sense if 
read silently.

“It shows me how much Joyce read it aloud 

in his head,” John says later. “He has a very 
amazing sense of the spoken word and the 
rhythm of things.”

I don’t doubt this. Joyce was a lot of things: 

novelist, poet, lover, father, closet atheist. He 
was also a singer and a pianist. In all of his works 
— from his short stories to his novels — there is 
distant music.

As of the late 1920s, scholars agreed that 

both Homer’s epics — “The Iliad” and “The 
Odyssey”— were probably the result not of 
one man’s genius, but of a centuries-long oral 
tradition. Homer was just the guy who thought 
to record them.

Joyce wanted to write an odyssey. And he 

took it one step further than I realized.

A day with 
‘Ulysses’


T

here’s self-control and then there’s self-indulgence. 
I’ve always struggled to find a balance between the 
two. In almost every aspect of my fledgling life it has 

seemed like I have no control over my actions. Impulse and 
gut reactions characterize the majority of what I do, and 
this fundamental flaw is most evident in my speech. As a 
result, I have turned a singular question over and over again 
in my mind for years as it has slowly eaten away at the thin 
line between control and indulgence: Why do I keep talking 
when all I want to do is shut up?

I wish I could put it more delicately, but alas I must be 

blunt. This tendency of mine applies to conversation, writ-
ing, even my laughter. I consistently overshare on certain 
aspects of my life while offering little to no information 
about others, and more often than not I 
find myself digressing on topics that need 
not be addressed. The talking character-
izes times of discomfort and anxiety and, 
sadly, has become a trait with which peo-
ple identify me. Although I may suffer 
from periods of silent self-examination, I 
find myself unable to suppress this deeply 
ingrained urge to speak. I berate myself 
afterward, knowing I should have kept to 
myself, but nonetheless the cycle contin-
ues.

There was an ongoing joke in my 

childhood that fell somewhere along the 
lines of “Natalie’s stories are the worst.” 
Harsh, yes, but true. I could not differ-
entiate between what would intrigue 
people and what only intrigued me. As 
a child, it all blended together, and thus 
poor victims would be stuck in the abyss 
of my storytelling, forced to await an 
ending that never came. For those wish-
ing to spare my feelings, there was no 
merciful death.

I always was a talker, and my parents 

were the only ones that could shut me up. 
This rejection that I faced at home made 
me search for eager ears in the faces 
of strangers. Those poor adults did not 
know that their blind politeness would 
be their downfall. Like me, they probably learned their “yes 
pleases” and “no thank yous” at a young age. Unlike me, they 
did not use this lesson in human decency as a way of trick-
ing people into listening to a tale that lacked tears and never 
triumphed. I engaged anyone, anywhere. My unsuccessful 
soccer career can be credited to the rule-abiding referees 
that would humor me. Instead of chasing after the ball like 
a normal, goal-oriented child, I would stand by the referee, 
chatting with him about the stunning weather at the indoor 
soccer field. Swimming followed a similar course, as there 
is recorded footage of me standing on a swim block in the 
middle of a race enthusiastically talking to the timer as he 
tries to focus on both my precariously positioned body and 
the swimmer in the lane before me.

Sadly, I haven’t grown far from my childhood ways, and 

my youthful faux pas continue to be relevant to my current 
storytelling abilities. Although I have thankfully improved 
my vocabulary and grown more reliable in my testimonies, 
I can’t seem to find the appropriate filter that distinguish-
es between the fascinating and the mundane. Surely it’s 
a subjective matter, but that does not excuse the multiple 
times I’ve been interrupted simply because my story was 
dull. There remains this small issue of me regarding every 

audience as wholly invested in my every word, and in this 
regard, narcissism is considered one of my most flattering 
traits. I’ve started to recognize the face of a disinterested 
listener, and when I do, I immediately begin floundering for 
help to avoid drowning in my own abyss. Not until recently, 
however, has this problem caused me a great deal of anxiety. 
Oversharing is a deeply ingrained fear of mine, a potential 
consequence of my upbringing.

Age 15 and brimming with unease, I approach my dad 

with a proposition: As a reward for my good grades, I want 
to dye my hair. Keeping the situation purely hypothetical, 
I explain to him how this change would be temporary and 
wouldn’t affect my good character or steer me down the 
emo path I had narrowly avoided in my youth. Not missing 

a beat, he counters with a new and improved hypothetical 
situation.

“How about instead, you draw a metaphorical teal line 

down the center of your face, and it can be special, because 
nobody except you will know it exists.”

Message received. I’m a Zak, and Zaks are inherently 

private people; we don’t ask for undesired attention, and we 
don’t place ourselves in that unforgivable center. I couldn’t 
dye my hair because that’s exactly the kind of edgy state-
ment I was supposed to desperately avoid making.

Three years later, this teal line still inches down the cen-

ter of my face as a reminder whenever I find myself on the 
brink of oversharing. I can no longer differentiate between 
news that is worthy of sharing and news that should be kept 
to myself. I can ensure though that I’ll feel guilty no matter 
what the decision. Specific people must be approached with 
specific topics in mind, or else our conversation will slowly 
descend into me drawing out tangents and reemphasizing 
punch lines as I await an enthusiastic response that never 
comes.

Humans are struck with the need to share not because 

we’re egotistical, which is what I’m naturally inclined to 
believe, but because it’s ingrained in our nature. In psychol-

ogy, self-concept describes how human beings are made up 
of three schemas: self-esteem, self-knowledge and the social 
self. These schemas are almost entirely defined by our inter-
actions with others — how we estimate our self-worth based 
on how our quirks and tendencies are perceived. I have no 
reason to fear oversharing or divulging precious informa-
tion, for it is simply human nature. Knowing this does not 
make the burden of anxiety any lighter, but knowing I’m not 
alone in my fears does.

We also evaluate ourselves based on how people react to 

our words, appearance, hand gestures, eyebrow raises — 
and maybe that’s why I find myself still talking as the anxi-
ety continues to rise. I feel the need to correct the verbal 
missteps and untie the social tongue twisters that I trip over 

day after day. Word vomit plagues 
me, and I suffer from an almost 
critical case. It claims the strongest 
among us, but like all fits of nausea, 
can be appeased by a monitored 
diet of saltines and ginger ale.

Unlike nausea though, the anxi-

ety isn’t fooled by offerings of 
carbonated beverages and wheat. 
Instead, it simply extends to sanc-
tuaries like the classroom. When 
conversation in a room dwindles 
and awkward silence begins to 
settle in, I take it upon myself to 
relieve everyone of it. Screw dig-
nity, pride and a general feeling 
of self-worth; I will throw myself 
into the lion’s den, take a bullet 
for surrounding contenders and 
toss myself under the bus simply to 
resolve these intolerable silences. 
The teacher will pose a question 
only to be met with acknowledged 
silence, and I settle into my accus-
tomed biblical role. Nailing my 
hands and feet into the bark, I 
prepare my spirit, open my mouth 
and immediately black out. What 
occurs in the next few minutes is 
a mystery to me, not because I’m 

baffled by my ability to compose complex statements, but 
because I genuinely suffer from a temporary lapse in mem-
ory. I liken it to a “Memento”-type situation, except nothing 
was murdered, other than the written word of intellectuals 
that came before me.

A wise, fictional fool by the name of Michael Scott once 

said, “Sometimes I start a sentence and I don’t know where 
it’s going. I just hope I find it along the way.” I often find 
myself relating to the words of this fictional fool, both in my 
writing and when I talk. The sentences I construct are built 
in lieu of the self-concept, constantly being reformed and 
torn apart by the reactions I perceive from those around me. 
I may never know where I’m going with it or how it will end, 
but I can be sure that it will end at some point. And that’s all 
that matters. As individuals we communicate through more 
than just our words; looking past the inane lava spilling 
forth from our mouths, it’s the actions, facial expressions 
and silence that describe us best. Looking in the mirror 
now, the teal line is beginning to resemble a scar, but not 
one that I’m forced to bear in reality, only hypothetically, 
and that makes all the difference.

What We Talk About When No One Is Listening

by Natalie Zak, Daily Arts Writer

ILLUSTRATION BY EMILIE FARRUGIA


Wednesday, February 17, 2016 // The Statement 
 
7B

by Logan Hansen, Daily Sports Writer
I 

was 16 years old when my son was born. And I 
remember, clear as day, sitting in that hospital room 
and holding him for the first time. The smile would 

not leave my lips, and my eyes could not be bothered to 
remain dry.

A couple of days later, I drove he and his mother to 

her parents’ house twenty minutes away from the hos-
pital, and I dare say it was probably the slowest and most 
careful I have ever driven in my life.

I got a job that summer, before my junior year of high 

school, washing dishes at a steakhouse-type restaurant. 
In August, I would wake up, drive the ten minutes to 
work down M-22, clock out just in time to head back 
into town and participate in two-a-day football practice, 
and then end the day spending time with my newborn 
son at his maternal grandparents’ house.

As a guy that was generally awkward around little 

kids, it took me a good deal of time to become used to 
being a parent. Especially in high school I found this 
hard.

I grew up in Northern Michigan, where, in a network 

of small towns and small high schools, everyone knew 
everything about everybody else.

I’d walk into a neighboring school’s gymnasium to 

cheer on our varsity basketball team, my son secured in 
my arms, and I would get the distinct sense that all of the 
opposing school’s kids were looking at me, judging me.

When I found out my girlfriend was pregnant, it 

was impossible to keep some negative thoughts out of 
my head: Now I’m going to be one of those kids who 
threw everything away for one night of unprotected 
fun, I thought. Now I’m going to be perceived as a lesser 
person, someone for whom the potential of success has 
been substantially lowered.

I had done most everything right up to that point. I 

had great friends, did well in school, volunteered my 
time at almost every opportunity. And all of a sudden, I 
felt as if the mortal error had been committed and every-
thing that preceded it was for naught. 

But it was not the end of the world. Not even close. My 

friends, while shocked at the news, could not have been 
more supportive. They jumped at the opportunity to be 
honorary “uncles” for my little guy. They let me know I 
was still a “good” person, and they wouldn’t look down 
upon me for becoming a dad at such a young age.

My parents and my son’s maternal grandparents 

offered as much help as they could, which was and 
continues to be a service to me that I will never be able 
to thank them enough for. Because of them, the ques-
tion of continuing my education or not was one that 
needn’t be asked.

Coming to the University of Michigan, though, pre-

sented me with new challenges as a young parent. 
When I said goodbye to my then-two-year-old son 
before leaving for college, I do not think I fully grasped 
what it would be like, what it would mean, to be four 
hours away from him for a greater part of the coming 
academic year.

But I understood the depth of that distance soon 

after arriving in Ann Arbor. After maybe five days on 
campus, I missed a call from my son on a Saturday. He 
left a voicemail.

“Hi, Daddy. I miss you. Come back. Bye.”
So then I sat there, and wondered: Was going to 

school this far from home really a good idea? Was my 
dream college something that should have just stayed 
a dream? 

I rationalized and justified and defended my deci-

sion to myself. I said, you’re going to a great school, 
which will lead to a great career, which will allow you 
to provide for your son in the future. 

But I still sit here and wonder, as a senior in my 

final semester at Michigan, whether I made the right 
choice in coming here and staying for four years. And 
I think back to freshman year, when I felt like I had a 
big secret to keep from everyone all over again.

Telling my friends at college that I was a dad was 

never an easy thing for me, and to some extent, it still 
isn’t. Approaching the subject with new people is like 
entering the gymnasium in that other high school, 
fearing how they will react, what they’ll think of me.

My sophomore year I took a developmental psy-

chology course, and on the first day, just out of curios-
ity as it related to the course material, the professor 
asked the 200-person class if anyone had children 
already. I didn’t raise my hand. 

The subject of having kids has come up during my 

time here on a number of occasions, and it is always in 
the context of looking toward the future. For me, that 

future began six years ago, when I first learned I was 
going to be a dad.

All the anxiety and stress and guilt I’ve experienced 

over my own insecurity is something I am disappoint-
ed in myself with. After all, everyone I have met, gen-
erally, has not reacted in a negative way to my having 
a son.

And, more significantly, all of the joy and pleasure 

and happiness that my son has brought me over the 
past five and a half years overshadows those nega-
tive feelings by far. He is smart as can be, funny in a 
way that oftentimes only kids can get away with — by 
being brutally honest — and his hugs are the ones I 
most look forward to.

Looking back on that first day in the hospital, hold-

ing him for the first time, tears threatening to wash 
down my face, I could never have imagined how much 
of a blessing in disguise that little guy was going to be.

And if I told you I didn’t cry while writing this, I’d 

be lying.
