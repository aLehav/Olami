Dialogue focuses 
on experiences 

with mental 

wellness on campus

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

During 
their 
last 
mass 

meeting of the year, the Black 
Student Union allotted time 
for a mental health dialogue 
to address the topic within the 
African-American community 
both on campus and at large. 
Discussion 
at 
the 
event 

focused on the lack of minority 
clinicians in Counseling and 
Psychological 
Services, 
as 

well as lack of knowledge 
about mental health resources 
and the effects of attending 
a 
predominantly 
white 

institution like the University 
of Michigan.

LSA junior Janice Allen and 

LSA senior Darian Lasenby 
moderated the event, which 
almost 50 students attended. 

Allen said hosting a mental 
health dialogue was imperative 
to getting members of the 
Black community on campus 
to talk about the stigmas that 
they face.

“It’s seen as something that 

is an issue, but not a serious 
issue that you need to seek help 
for,” she said. “You put it off to 
the side or it’s something that 
you put in the dark.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Shavon 

Edwards 
said 
she 
is 
an 

active member of the BSU 
and found the topics of the 
meeting important, especially 
addressing mental health and 
illness concerns raised by her 
peers.

“I’m a part of the community, 

so I know from experience that 
these issues are very much valid 
and true,” she said. “It’s just 
a simple lack of not knowing 
and the struggles we face as a 
community contributes to the 
fact that we don’t know the 
signs of mental illness.”

These struggles, Edwards 

said, are what she and others 

Brandon Stanton 

speaks in Hill 
on his path to 

photojournalism

BRANDON SUMMERS-

Daily News Editor and Daily Staff 

Reporter

One human from New York 

managed to find his way to the 

University of Michigan despite 
high winds and rainy weather 
Thursday night.

Brandon Stanton, renowned 

photojournalist and creator of the 
book and blog “Humans of New 
York,” delivered the Center for 
Campus Involvement’s annual 
Change Our World Lecture to 
a sold-out Power Center for the 
Performing Arts.

According to CCI’s website, 

the annual Change Our World 
lecture was created in 2015 to 
spark a conversation among 
students on creating positive 

impacts within the University 
community and the world at 
large. This year’s event was 
sponsored by other institutions 
and 
organizations 
at 
the 

University, including the Center 
for Social Impact, the Stamps 
School of Art & Design and the 
Office of Global Education and 
Engagement.

During the lecture, Stanton 

recounted the life events that led 
him to pursue photojournalism 
and create his largest blog and 
photojournalist 
compilation, 

“Humans of New York.” Followed 

by more than 14 million people on 
Facebook, HONY is comprised 
of street portraits of New York 
residents accompanied by quoted 
captions about their day-to-day 
lives.

However, 
HONY 
wasn’t 

always 
the 
international 

sensation that it is today. Stanton 
said before starting the blog, he 
was a bond broker in Chicago 
hoping to earn enough income to 
pursue his true life passions.

After two years on the job, he 

was fired and left without much

Evaluation 
information 

now available to 
undergraduates

By ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

Just in time for backpacking 

and class registration, a new 
tool that displays course data 
from the past five to six years 
— Academic Reporting Toolkit 
2.0, or ART 2.0 — has become 
available to students.

The course evaluation data 

does not include individual 
professor 
evaluations 
or 

courses that had fewer than 
30 evaluation responses, and 
students do not have access to 
grade distributions or average 
GPAs for the courses taken.

The 
tool, 
which 
went 

live Tuesday, is designed to 
give students an interactive 
platform to answer questions 
about 
course 
evaluations, 

enrollment 
during 
each 

semester, the major and year 
distributions of students who 
took the class and the pre-
enrollment, 
co-enrollment 

and post-enrollment of other 
classes. It was developed by the 
Digital Innovation Greenhouse, 
a program within the Digital 
Education 
and 
Innovation 

department, 
which 
was 

established last year to increase 
academic software on campus. 

Information 
graduate 

student 
Christanna 

Hemingway is one of the 

student fellows who worked 
on ART 2.0. Hemingway said 
they originally planned to make 
more information available to 
the public, but decided to limit 
available information due to 
faculty concerns.

“Originally, we had some 

ideas 
of 
showing 
more 

information, 
and 
then 
in 

consulting 
with 
faculty 

colleagues we decided to step 
back,” Evrard said. “There were 
some trade-offs that we needed 
to make in order to get here. 
What we want to see from the 
student engagement is to see if 
you are actually using this tool, 
what you’d like to see and then 
engage in conversation with the 
Provost’s office and the deans 
across the University to align 
ourselves with respect to what 
should students know.”

The tool uses selected data 

from the course evaluations 
taken every year. For all the 
schools besides Ross School of 
Business, answers to questions 
on the desire to take the course, 
whether the student learned a 
great deal from the course and 
whether the course had a large 
workload are available. For the 
Business School, the questions 
shown are whether the student 
had a strong interest to take the 
class and whether the material 
is helpful.

It is currently linked to on 

both Wolverine Access and the 
LSA Course Guide last week.

Physics Prof. Gus Evrard, 

the ART 2.0 team lead, said 
the project is part of a number 
of initiatives, such as releasing

Michigan to open 
NCAA Tournament 
play against Notre 
Dame in Cincinnati

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Editor

Last weekend, the Michigan 

hockey team was able to go 
to the Big Ten Tournament 
without 
worrying 
about 
its 

season ending — the Wolverines 
had already secured a spot in the 
NCAA Tournament.

With 
the 
conference 

tournament 
over, 
Michigan 

(12-5-3 
Big 
Ten, 
24-7-5 

overall) 
moves 
on 
to 
the 

NCAA 
Tournament, 
where 

the situation is a little more 
desperate: Either win or go 
home.

The 
seventh-ranked 

Wolverines head to Cincinnati to 
face No. 12 Notre Dame (15-5-2 
Hockey East, 19-10-7) on Friday 
night. And if last weekend’s 
Big Ten Tournament win was 
an 
indication 
of 
anything, 

Michigan is ready to go.

The Wolverines demolished 

Penn 
State 
for 
the 
third 

straight 
game, 
winning 
7-2 

behind freshman forward Kyle 
Connor’s four goals. The team 
followed the thrashing with a 
5-3 win over Minnesota the next 
night to win the title.

“The 
past 
few 
years, 
it 

seemed 
to 
come 
down 
to 

whether we won our conference 
championship if we got into the

Event highlights 

women in the 

workforce, gender 

gap 

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

The University of Michigan 

Society of Women Engineers and 
the Center for Entrepreneurship 
held a seminar and group 
discussion titled “Strategies to 
Overcome Gender Stereotypes” 
Thursday 
afternoon 
for 
an 

audience of nearly 40 students. 
The discussion was a part of 

a new lecture series called 
Empowering Women through 
Entrepreneurship, 
which 

explores how business ethics and 
power ethics can defeat gender 
inequality in the workplace.

The 
discussion 
was 
led 

by Elizabeth Rohr, an intern 
from the University’s Center 
for the Education of Women. 
Throughout 
the 
session, 

Rohr focused on helping the 
group recognize and address 
microagressions 
as 
well 

mediating 
small 
group-led 

conversations.

Rohr 
described 

microagressions 
as 
everyday 

verbal 
or 
nonverbal 

environmental 
slights, 
snubs 

and insults; more often than not, 
she said, they are subconsciously 
performed by an individual 
with a privileged, or majority, 
background.

“Through 
years 
of 
my 

training and experience in social 
work, I automatically pick up on 
instances when people say ‘all of 
mankind,’ ” she said. “It makes 
me, and other women, feel 
excluded, like we were not a part 
of the history as well.”

As 
an 
example 
of 
a 

microagression, Rohr discussed 
instances like when men will 
spread out their legs on public 
transportation, possibly taking 
up two seats, while women are

ACADEMICS

Entrepreneurship seminar 
discusses microaggressions


expected to cross their legs and 
take up as little space as possible.

Rackham student Jessica Chen 

said she was intrigued by the 
topic and decided to attend the 
seminar particularly to discuss 
issues like the gender gap among 
minority groups.

“I’ve always been interested 

and 
involved 
in 
women’s 

rights,” Chen said. “I do a lot of 
volunteering and the organization 
I’m involved with, we’re very 
interested in promoting a way 
to lessen the gender gap and 
for underrepresented minority 
groups.”

In addition to discussion of 

personal experiences and ways 
to 
resolve 
workplace 
issues 

resulting from microaggressions, 
the seminar also focused on 
progress made in recent years 
in gender equality. Many of the 
statistics in the presentation 
pertained to those in STEM 
fields — science, technology, 
engineering 
and 
math 
— 

including that women make up 20 
percent of engineering graduates, 

but only make up 11 percent of the 
engineering workforce.

Rackham 
student 
Jamie 

Do, 
who 
also 
attended 
the 

seminar, said she wanted to 
better understand how these 
microagressions and stereotypes 
play out in everyday life.

“I thought the title sounded 

interesting, and it would be neat 
to recognize how people view 
others and find out how to take 
away what I learn here to break 
down those barriers for my own 
sake,” Do said.

Ashleigh 
Bell, 
a 
student 

administration assistant for the 
Center 
for 
Entrepreneurship, 

said the center decided to start 
the seminar series in the College 
of Engineering because of the 
significant gender disparity in 
those fields.

“I really believe in the power 

of entrepreneurship as a means 
of empowering everyone, but 
especially women and individuals 
who are underrepresented in 
STEM,” Bell said. “I want them 
to really pursue their goals, 
whether that be starting your 
own company someday, working 
for a startup or innovating within 
an existing industry.”

City, University 
officials hold two 
meetings to address 

potential issues

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

At an open house held to discuss 

theproposed plan for the Ann 
Arbor Connector Thursday night, 
local residents raised concerns 
about the University of Michigan’s 
financial role in the joint project 
and how much city residents stand 
to benefit.

The proposed Connector would 

either take the form of a light rail, 
a type of public transport similar 
to a tramway, or a high-capacity 
bus service. The rail would link 
the southern end of Ann Arbor 
from Briarwood Mall, through 
the University’s Central, Medical 
and North Campuses, to the city’s 
northern extreme at US-23 and 
Plymouth Road.

Thursday night’s meeting was 

the second held regarding the 
connector — another was held 
earlyier in the day. During both, 

city and University officials met 
with community members and 
students to discuss the project.

According to representatives 

of AECOM, the consulting firm 
hired to manage the project, the 
preliminary study on the light rail 
is complete, and public input will 
be collected before the next phase 
will proceed. The entire process of 
design finalization, procurement 
and construction is estimated to 
take between six and 12 years.

Jeremy 
Winsor, 
one 
of 

the 
AECOM 
representatives, 

described the Briarwood Mall-
Plymouth Road corridor as the 
busiest transportation corridor in 
the entire state of Michigan — with 
28 percent of the city’s residents 
and 51 percent of the city’s jobs 
within walking distance of the 
proposed path — and the place 
where most of the city’s future 
growth would take place.

He also noted that current bus 

traffic between downtown Ann 
Arbor and North Campus — at one 
bus every 90 seconds per stop and 
50,000 daily trips — has exhausted 
existing road capacity.

Winsor said the project is 

expected to reduce travel times 
along the corridor by 43 percent 

and 
increase 
rider 
capacity 

by 52 percent, at an estimated 
cost of $500 to $700 million for 
construction and an 8 percent 
increase in annual transportation 
operations expenditures by the 
city and University.

“If you were to go online to 

the 
(Federal 
Transportation 

Administration) and look at all 
the new projects they have around 
the country in major metropolitan 
areas, this project, for the amount 
of ridership, ends up looking like a 
bargain,” Winsor said, adding that 
a combination of state and federal 
grants would also likely pay a large 
portion of the cost.

However, many of the residents 

in attendance expressed concerns 
about whether the University 
would be the primary beneficiary 
of the connector at the expense of 
city taxpayers.

Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Vince 

Caruso pointed out the majority 
of traffic along the proposed 
connector route is University 
students, saying the University 
should therefore pay a larger 
share of the costs, drawing nods of 
approval from the crowd.

“This is really a U of M corridor; 

this is not an Ann Arbor corridor 

…and that’s fine,” Caruso said. 
“Maybe they should be asked to 
step up and provide a lot more 
funding than they previously 
stated they would.”

Jim 
Kosteva, 
community 

relations director for the University, 
acknowledged residents’ concerns. 
In an interview, he said the 
University intends to pay for 
75 percent ofthe next phase of 
environmental reviews, and to 
continue to financially contribute 
in subsequent phases. However, 
he said the exact amount the 
University would contribute for 
the entire project is still to be 
determined.

“It’s 
unquestionable 
that 

University 
ridership 
will 
be 

a primary beneficiary of this 
project,” Kosteva said. “We’ve paid 
for that system today, and we’re 
prepared to pay a proportional cost 
for any future system.”

Caruso — who said he has many 

family members who work or study 
at the University — added after the 
meeting that most of the proposed 
stops along the connector route 
are only at University locations, 
further limiting how much it could 
benefit city residents.

course evaluations and data 
about classes, to expand access 
for students.

“We wanted to take a look at 

the behavior, various aspects of 
behavior, of students, and we 
set up a small group of people 
to oversee the project,” Evrard 
said.

University Provost Martha 

Pollack said the tool allows 
students to interact with one 
another in a new way.

“It’s a tool where you can go 

in and you can find out obvious 
sort of things like what are the 
prerequisites, and you can find 
out things like, of the students 
who took this course, how 
many took this other course, 
or how many took this course 
at the same time,” Pollack 
said. “It helps you think about 
courses in context. It’s a way 
of sharing student knowledge 
and 
what 
students 
have 

experienced themselves with 
one another.”

Rachel Niemer, a director of 

the project, said the tool allows 
students to find information 
about courses more efficiently 
and in a consolidated space.

“One 
of 
the 
advantages 

that we see is by having data, 
students don’t have to go online 
and search,” Niemer said. “They 
can, in fact, use what other 
students have said in course 
evaluations 
and 
what 
the 

data are common trajectories 
through curriculars.”

Niemer said she thinks the 

tool is particularly helpful for 
students who are exploring 
majors 
and 
subject 
levels 

because they can see what 
kinds of students are taking 
particular courses.

Chris 
Teplovs, 
the 
lead 

developer at DIG, said the data 
included is from more than 
9,000 undergraduate courses, 
going back six years for every 
course. Teplovs said the team 
worked on providing the most 
aggregate, objective source for 
students.

“It’s 
attractive; 
it’s 
not 

distilled 
down 
from 
other 

sources and it’s not based 
on requests to access the 
information,” he said.

Because 
the 
tool 
uses 

internal data collected by the 
University, Niemer said the 
tool is more useful than other 
online sources.

“By looking at the data and 

the graphs available, they can 

get a real sense of what actually 
happens as opposed to what 
they hear from their RA or their 
roommate or from friends said 
happens,” she said. “With more 
data comes more educated 
decision making.”

The project is a second 

version of an interface created 
in 2006, ART, that was only 
available to faculty and showed 
enrollment, pairs of courses 
taken simultaneously and grade 
distributions, among other data 
sets. The team for ART 2.0 
said they wanted to take that 
experience, present it in a user-
friendly way and deliver it to 
students.

Though the program is now 

available to all undergraduate 
students, 
Evrard 
said 
the 

interface is likely to change 
over time with feedback from 
users.

“This is very much a beta 

product that may change as we 
move into Fall 2016,” he said. 
“We have room to grow so one 
of the things that we’d like to do 
is get feedback from students 
on utility of the services we’re 
providing. If there are negative 
aspects 
that 
you 
feel 
are 

important for us to know, then 
we simply want to hear from 
you.”

‘U’ study finds 
benefits of medical 
marijuana

A study released Thursday 

afternoon by the University 
determined consumption of 
medical marijuana decreases 
patients’ use of opioids, or 
traditional pain medications.

Researchers from the school 

of Public Health and the Medical 
School surveying 158 patients 
from a local medical marijuana 
dispensary found respondents 
suffered fewer side effects from 
their medications and a 45 percent 
improvement in quality of life after 
using cannabis to manage pain. 
The researchers suggested medical 
marijuana may be a viable option 
for patients currently taking costly 
prescription pain medication. 

The study’s findings come 

a week after the Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
issued a release highlighting 
the exponential increase in 
prescriptions for opioids since 
1999. The CDC recommended the 
medical community cut down on 
prescribing opioids in light of their 
addictive qualities. 

Officials tighten 
security following 
Brussels attack

Law enforcement officials in 

Detroit have been on high alert 
since Wednesday’s terror attacks 
in Brussels, Belgium. Though 
law enforcement across the 
country has heightened security 
measures, local authorities 
reported additional scrutiny due 
to Detroit’s shared border with 
Canada, the Detroit Free Press 
reported on Thursday. 

The Detroit police department 

has increased the presence of 
officers at key areas in the city, 
including the Rosa Parks Transit 
Center, though no credible 
threats to the city have been 
disclosed.

The city’s FBI department also 

boosted surveillance of “priority 
subjects” in the metro Detroit 
area. U.S. attorney Barbara 
McQuade stressed regional law 
enforcement would not profile 
Muslim or Arab residents, and 
is instead working closely with 
communities to guard against 
hate crimes and backlash. 

Student earns 
competitive 
scholarship

Karl Winsor, an LSA and 

Engineering senior, has been 
awarded a Churchill Scholarship 
from Cambridge University for 
graduate studies, the University 
announced Thursday. 

Winsor is one of 15 recipients 

this year, and the University’s 
13th Churchill Scholar since the 
program’s inception in 1959.

Winsor will graduate with a 

dual degree in LSA and the College 
of Engineering, concentrating 
in mathematics, electrical 
engineering and computer science. 
His research with professors 
at multiple universities covers 
subjects from complex dynamics 
and elliptical curves to quantum 
computation. Winsor plans on 
seeking a master’s degree in 
mathematics at Cambridge, and a 
Ph.D. afterward.

Study highlights 
phosphorus in 
Lake Erie

A study conducted by the 

University’s Water Center 
announced the state needs to 
make drastic adjustments in order 
to achieve its goal of a 40 percent 
drop in Lake Erie’s phosphorus 
levels, Michigan Radio reported 
Thursday. 

Both U.S. and Canadian 

governments agreed to the 
reduction last month, but the 
study found stronger changes to 
current farming practices will 
be necessary and challenging to 
produce harmful algae blooms. The 
lake’s contamination became so 
extreme in 2014 the city of Toledo 
was forced to shut down access to 
tap water for two days.

in her community have to face 
every day.

“The 
struggles 
that 
we 

face day to day in being at a 
PWI (Predominately White 
Institution), 
being 
around 

people 
that 
don’t 
really 

understand 
where 
we’re 

coming from,” she said. “The 
struggles we face in always 
having 
to 
overcompensate 

for the things that we do 
because of how society is and 
how it portrays the Black 
community.”

Allen 
said 
one 
of 
the 

primary reasons for having 
a 
mental 
health 
dialogue 

was to reassure others in 
the organization that there 
is support network that will 
exist for them.

“People 
can 
know 
and 

understand 
that 
this 
is 

something important that you 
need to talk about, that you 
need to seek help for, that this 
is a real issue, that people care 
about you, that they love you,” 
she said. “In our community 
we don’t take care of ourselves 
health-wise, so I think it’s 
important 
to 
have 
these 

meetings so that people know 
that you need to take care of 
your health.”

LSA junior Brianna Jenkins 

said she found the event to 
be a good way of spreading 
community 
awareness 
and 

solidarity. 
Mental 
health 

dialogues, like this one, are 
an opportunity for people to 
empathize and relate to one 

another on an often ignored 
topic, she said. 

“It’s 
not 
talked 
about 

enough and people suffer in 
silence and it’s not OK to just 
sit there,” Jenkins said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Deashia 

Johnson said minorities are 
often 
silent 
about 
mental 

health issues they may face 
because mental health is often 
understood as a problem for 
white people. She said this 
cultural 
rejection 
makes 

it 
difficult 
for 
others 
to 

recognize symptoms of mental 
health issues they may be 
experiencing.

“There is that complete 

stigma that we have to be 
better than everybody else 
or we aren’t supposed to go 
through feelings like this,” 
she said. “Growing up, your 
parents would tell you that if 
it’s something that you feel 
like you’re going through, 
that’s not really what it is, and 
it’s just looked at as an excuse. 
At the same time, people 
don’t realize, even within 
themselves, to what extent 
they’re actually going through 
these issues until it’s too late 
for them to do something 
about it.”

Allen said she hoped students 

who 
attended 
the 
event 

understood mental health is a 
serious issue and a prevailing 
student concern on campus, 
with resources available for 
those who need them.

“This is a real issue, and 

you really need to be proactive 
about your mental health,” she 
said. “There are resources on 
campus and outside of campus 
that can really, really help 

you. The help is there — you 
just need to get it and need 
to realize that it’s important 
for you to seek out those 
resources.”

Kinesiology 
senior 

Capri’Nara Kendall, speaker 
of the Black Student Union, 
said she does not believe the 
University is doing enough 
to 
support 
students 
with 

mental illnesses, adding that 
attending 
a 
predominantly 

white institution contributes 
to mental health concerns 
among 
minority 
students, 

especially Black students.

“I’m the only Black woman 

in all of my classes, except 
for one, and that’s an African 
American Studies class,” she 
said. “When you go in class and 
you’re the only representative 
of your race and your gender 
as they intersect, it’s hard 
because now I deal with the 
Black people stereotype of 
being extremely lazy and piss 
poor, but I also deal with the 
stereotype of being a woman. 
So I walk in and I’m already 
mentally not there.”

When students are away 

from 
their 
comfort 
zone, 

Kendall said, they don’t know 
how to handle Predominately 
White 
Institution 

environments like that of the 
University.

“We have people here who 

have never seen Black people 
before and never seen Latino 
people before or never had 
to engage with them unless 
their parents were overseeing 
them,” she said. “That has a 
lot to do with our experience 
as students and it’s not an easy 
one.”

tournament,” Michigan coach 
Red Berenson told reporters 
Thursday 
in 
Cincinnati. 

“Even though we did win our 
conference championship, our 
team earned their way into this 
tournament (before that).”

Notre Dame is the second 

Hockey East opponent that 
Michigan 
has 
played 
this 

season — the first was Boston 
University back in November, 
when the Wolverines split a 
two-game series in Boston.

The Fighting Irish will head 

to Cincinnati after not playing 
this past weekend. They were 
knocked out of the Hockey East 
playoffs by No. 13 Northeastern, 
who is on the other side of the 
NCAA regional bracket.

But Notre Dame forward 

Thomas DiPauli sees that as a 
blessing in disguise.

“The week off was good 

for us. It let us get our heads 
straight,” 
DiPauli 
said 

Wednesday in Cincinnati. “We 
could focus on fixing a few of 
the little things. I think we are 
ready for tomorrow’s game. 
The pace is definitely going 
to be fast, and that’s a part of 
our game that we have been 
focusing on.”

The Wolverines’ offensive 

output leads the nation. Yet, 
the Fighting Irish are not far 
behind at No. 15 and are led by 

forward Anders Bjork and Jake 
Evans, who have both tallied 33 
points this season.

Notre Dame’s defense is 

driven 
by 
goaltender 
Cal 

Peterson, 
who 
boasts 
a 

.928 save percentage, good 
enough for 13th in the nation. 
Peterson will be tasked with 
stopping Michigan’s first line 
of junior forward Tyler Motte, 
JT Compher and freshman 
forward Kyle Connor.

“Definitely playing against 

the highest-scoring team in 
the country is going to be a 
challenge for our whole team,” 
Petersen said. “But I think 
we prepared ourselves and 
our defensive structure, and I 
think that will translate well 
into tomorrow’s game.”

The Fighting Irish are led 

by coach Jeff Jackson, who 
has coached Notre Dame to six 
NCAA Tournaments and two 
Frozen Four appearances. In 
2008, Jackson led the Fighting 
Irish to a 5-4 overtime win over 
Berenson and the Wolverines 
to make the title game.

“Jeff’s a real good coach,” 

Berenson said. “He put Notre 
Dame on an even keel, and he’s 
done a good job there.”

The winner of the two 

athletic powerhouses will take 
on the victor of North Dakota 
and Northeastern.

North Dakota is led in 

scoring by its top line, forwards 
Brock Boeser, Drake Caggiula 
and Nick Schmaltz. Earlier 

this season, Fighting Hawks 
goaltender 
Cam 
Johnson 

earned the second longest 
shutout streak in NCAA history 
by not allowing a goal in over 
298 minutes of play.

Northeastern comes into the 

tournament hot and has lost 
only once in its past 23 games 
— a remarkable feat given that 
its record going into 2016 was 
3-12-3. The Huskies are led 
in scoring by forward Zach 
Aston-Reese, who has 14 goals 
and 29 assists to date.

Before 
Michigan 
has 

the opportunity to face the 
Fighting Hawks or the Huskies, 
however, it must get past Notre 
Dame, a team the Wolverines 
haven’t played since the last 
CCHA Tournament title game 
in 2013.

But Wednesday, the Fighting 

Irish announced they would be 
leaving the Hockey East for the 
Big Ten for the 2017-18 season.

“I think Notre Dame is 

a perfect fit: academically, 
they’re 
in 
our 
geographic 

footprint, competitiveness and 
they have a great facility and 
program,” Berenson said. “I 
think it’s a win-win situation 
for the Big Ten and Notre 
Dame.”

So while the teams haven’t 

seen each other in three years, 
they will be seeing a lot of each 
other in the near future.

They might as well start 

getting acquainted with one 
another now.

saved money. Looking back, 
Stanton said losing his job as a 
broker was a significant setback, 
but in turn caused him to reassess 
his true goals for his life.

“Two years had gone by where 

I had lost my thoughts; they’d 
been taken away from my true 
goal in life,” he said. “I realized 
that no amount of money that I 
made in those two years could 
possibly have bought that time 
back.”

Stanton said he soon after 

adopted a goal to have a fulfilling 
life while pursuing his true 
passions in photography.

“This is the decision that 

Humans of New York was 
founded on, and everything that 
came was built upon,” he said. “I 
made my decision that I’m going 
to structure the rest of my life to 
where I can make just enough 
money to control my time.”

Stanton said shortly after 

being 
fired, 
he 
moved 
to 

New York to further pursue 
photography, enabling him to 
separate his identity from the 
broking market.

“Photography 
was 
like 
a 

treasure hunt for me,” he said. 
“Just going out onto the streets 
and not knowing what you’re 
going to find, and just to find to 
something amazing and be able 
to capture it, it was so fun to me.”

The early stages of his 

photography in New York were 
only photographs of buildings, 
people 
and 
other 
subjects 

throughout the city. He said a 
pivotal moment for his work 
was when he photographed a 
woman standing on a sidewalk 
and attached a quote to the 
photo when he posted it on 
Facebook.

“Ever since that moment, 

Humans of New York became all 
about my mission, and became 
all about getting as good as I 
possibly can get at stopping a 
person on the street and creating 
an atmosphere,” he said. “A style 
of conversation where with a 
very short amount of time I could 
have a very deep and meaningful 
conversation with a complete 
stranger that will reveal glimpses 
into their lives,” he said.

Stanton also shared comical 

asides and anecdotes throughout 
the 
night 
about 
interacting 

with his photography subjects 
globally. In addition to capturing 
subjects in New York, Stanton 
has also traveled to Iraq, Iran 
and Pakistan, where he has 
interviewed refugees affected by 
violence in the Middle East.

After the event, LSA junior 

Ryan Mak, a CCI program 
assistant, 
said 
Stanton’s 

experiences 
photographing 

subjects in the Middle East made 
him the perfect fit to deliver the 
lecture.

“We felt that Brandon was 

one of the best speakers to 
come because of his work with 
the Syrian refugees as well as 
the prison inmates,” Mak said. 
“It’s something that everyone 
resonates with because everyone 
loves stories, and so we thought 
that this would be the best 
speaker to come and give the 
greatest impact to students who 
come tonight.”

In a Q&A session after the 

event, Stanton said traveling to 

places like Iraq and Pakistan 
was beneficial in countering 
dominant misconceptions about 
life in the Middle East.

“I find that Humans of New 

York is most effective and 
most impactful in places that 
are feared,” he said. “In these 
countries they have such a string 
of negative news coming out of 
them — it results in us having 
an unnatural fear of these 
countries.”

Even though HONY often 

grapples with difficult subject 
matters, Stanton emphasized his 
work aims to highlight untold 
stories.

“Every revolution, every turn 

that I’ve made, every strategic 
decision that I’ve made with 
Humans of New York has been 
based on this core understanding 
that Humans of New York is 
not 
about 
photography, 
it’s 

not writing, but the soul of 
Humans of New York is all about 
the interaction with perfect 
strangers.”

He ended his remarks by 

encouraging students to reflect 
on their true aspirations in life.

“My goal was to figure out a 

way to make just enough money 
to do what I loved all day long,” 
he said. “That is something I 
am positive, if you’re willing to 
work, you can figure that out 
too.”

Stanton’s remarks resonated 

with many University students 
who 
attended 
the 
lecture, 

including Engineering freshman 
Marc Chattrabhuti, who said he 
decided to attend because he’s 
followed Stanton’s work for 
several years.

“I think HONY is a very 

noble cause,” Chattrabhuti said. 
“I would say it’s also really 
unique because you’re talking 
to everyday people who you 
don’t think would have very 
interesting stories.”

Chattrabhuti added he would 

remember 
Stanton’s 
words 

about finding an identity that 
would help him pursue his 
dreams.

“I really feel that people lose 

sight of their identity, and that’s 
why they change so much, and 
their goals are just completely 
skewed,” he said. “I really 
think I can apply that to myself 
because identity is what allows 
me to stay true to myself, allows 
me to know what I want to do 
and it really allows me to be 
rooted in my passions.”

First-year Law student Xun 

Yuan said he wanted to attend 
the lecture because he used to 
be a New York Times journalist 
and has worked with Middle 
Eastern refugees in Turkey.

“I think what (Brandon) does 

is just so fantastic,” he said. “It’s 
so different from anything I’ve 
ever done and anything else 
anyone else has ever done.”

Yuan said he plans to carry 

Stanton’s words of not giving up 
on your dreams during his time 
at the University.

“Start something you are 

passionate about and then don’t 
just get surrounded by your 
future plans, because things 
might 
change,” 
Yuan 
said. 

“If you’re passionate about 
something, go for it.”

The Trotter Multicultural 

Center will host a follow-up 
event Friday to discuss themes 
Stanton highlighted during his 
remarks.

W

hat good can it do to be foolish?

Each year on the weekend 

nearest 
to 
April 
Fools’ 

Day, 
hundreds 
of 

Ann 
Arborites 
and 

University of Michigan 
students 
share 
their 

interpretations of the 
answer to this question 
in the form of a gigantic, 
bizarre 
parade 
of 

puppets.

Mark 
Tucker, 
art 

director of the Lloyd 
Hall Scholars Program, 
a 
Michigan 
Learning 

Community 
that 

encourages 
students 

to pursue passions of art and writing, is 
the father of the project. Together with 
former LHSP student Shoshana Hurand, 
he founded the festivities in Ann Arbor 
in 2006 in hopes of bringing the Ann 
Arbor community together with a little 
foolishness.

Tucker (or as some of his students 

affectionately call him behind his back, 
Marky Mark) hatched the idea after 
traveling to Europe “to learn the fine art of 
cartapesta (papier-mâché) from esteemed 
float builders in Viareggio, Italy.” Full of life 
and color like Tucker himself, thousands of 
people annually flock the streets of Italy 
to partake in the crazy, human-powered 
celebration. Adding his own unique style, 
he used the Italian influences to create 
his own unreasonable but crowd-pleasing 
event. This year, FestiFools celebrates its 
10th anniversary. 

At last year’s event, I helped a friend 

perform with her giant piece. She had 
made a large, mustached Monopoly man 
— social commentaries are popular among 
the event’s puppets — that commented on 
the greed of our society. The man himself 
took three people to control — one person 
to hoist and balance the pole going through 
the puppet’s body and two others to animate 
each of his arms. In order to contribute 
chaos to the crowd, my friend also made 
several Monopoly game pieces — a tinfoil 
car, train and iron that she had convinced 

others to wear on their heads while they run 
around the puppet’s gesticulating arms. She 
also made a separate Monopoly man head, 
which she made another girl wear. Because 
the girl could not see through the mask, my 
job was to watch her and make sure she did 
not fall onto a small child.

Certainly, the event is a sort of chaos: 

children dressed as butterflies and monsters 
blowing bubbles; dragons and banners 
weaving and wrapping around participants; 
giant puppets including robots, historic 
figures such as Marie Antoinette, octopi and 
gigantic babies holding cell phones. There 
are even bands playing shiny instruments 
and the audience sitting, squealing, clapping 
on the curbside. 

Aside from the intriguing public art 

created by the participants, the implications 
go beyond the tangible fantastic — through 
the event’s creations and performances, 
the community hopefully is brought a 
little closer. According to the WonderFool 
Productions website, the group is “a 
nonprofit 
organization 
dedicated 
to 

engaging 
communities 
in 
dynamic, 

educational, collaborative and entertaining 
public art experiences.” The art is free and 
accessible to all, involving people of all ages.

As a relatively new Ann Arbor resident, it 

is difficult for me to try and determine how 
FestiFools has changed the community. 
Upon first glance, FestiFools might seem 
small and insignficant in our community, 
but FestiFools can do no harm. FestiFools 
makes art more accessible and enjoyable 
and it joins people of all different ages to 
create, celebrate and be uncomplicatedly 
foolish. Only positivity can come from that.

One thing you should know: When Mark 

Tucker throws an event, it always rains.

Bring 
a 
raincoat, 
but 
leave 
your 

inhibitions at home.

Stay foolish.
A FoolMoon (pre-FestiFools night parade 

and street party) takes place from dusk on 
Friday, April 1, until midnight on downtown 
Ann Arbor’s Main Street on Sunday, April 3, 
from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

I

t mystifies me how despite nearly 
24-hour coverage by every major media 
organization, there are still people 

surprised that Donald Trump is the front-
runner for the Republican nomination. 
Sure, there are plenty of Americans whom 
Trump’s bigotry and slogan of “Make 
America Great Again” speak to, but that’s 
nothing new in American politics. What’s 
new is the entertainment value. A candidate 
running on a platform of building a wall 
that Mexico will pay for, and banning an 
entire religion from entering the United 
States looks more like someone running to 
be a Saturday Night Live caricature than 
president of the United States.

The media, however, began this race 

as if Trump was a serious candidate, and 
the effect has been like a snowball ever 
since. Trump gets more TV time, meaning 
more people see him, meaning the media 
feels the demand to focus on him. While 
The Huffington Post may add an editor’s 
note to all Trump articles reminding their 
readers he is a racist and xenophobe among 
other things, no serious organization 
has had the common decency to say they 
won’t be drawn into this madness. News 
organizations around the country long ago 
abandoned their need to cover what’s truly 
important for what will bring in revenue, 
but this is one of the first times this choice 
has serious repercussions.

It’s this legitimization of Trump’s bigotry 

by the media that has led voters to support 
him in droves, but there is a way to end this. 
It’s as simple as saying no.

This past weekend, I attended the 

American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s 
Policy Conference in Washington D.C. As a 
bipartisan organization, AIPAC invited all 
active presidential candidates to address 
the more than 18,000 delegates about their 
views on the American-Israel relationship. 
All but Sen. Bernie Sanders accepted the 
invitation. There was immediate outcry 

from the Jewish and pro-Israel communities 
that allowing Donald Trump to speak would 
legitimize his bigotry and send the message 
to the world that AIPAC condones these 
beliefs. AIPAC clarified their position, 
saying they weren’t endorsing Trump, but 
that given Trump has a significant chance 
of becoming president, it is important to 
build a relationship with him. Given how 
legitimized Trump has become, it’s tough to 
see the error in this.

Yet while AIPAC may have felt the need 

to hear from the likely nominee, I and many 
others did not. Most of the conference 
was a bastion where pro-Israel supporters 
from all walks of life came together for a 
common purpose. But when Trump took the 
stage, a community that had talked for two 
days about the need for peace applauded 
a candidate who has called for banning 
Muslims, the group so vital to a productive 
peace in the Middle East, from entering the 
United States.

So, I and hundreds of delegates in the 

arena stood up and quietly walked out. I 
joined a group of about 30 rabbis, students 
and activists in a protest titled Come 
Together Against Hate. While attendees 
inside the arena applauded Trump’s pander 
and bigotry, we joined together in a sports 
bar just outside to learn from the Jewish 
texts about the need to educate those who 
stray from the path of decency. We learned, 
we sung and we were respectful. 

While responding to Trump with loud 

protests may seem natural given his 
vitriolic behavior, so far it only empowers 
him. Stopping Trump doesn’t require 
posters, signs and screaming, it requires 
turning off your TV. It may be impossible 
to stop Trump’s road to the nomination 
now, but it isn’t too late to stop our national 
embarrassment.

Saying no to Trump

I 

believe there’s a sense of 
achievability that comes with 
being on a college campus, 

especially one as prestigious as 
this university’s. We all came to 
Ann Arbor with the belief that 
our experiences here would be 
life-changing; that we would, in 
some way, make an impact on our 
surroundings and be remembered 
by the students following after us. 
Ever since freshman orientation, 
we’ve been told that we’re the 
“leaders and best” because we’ve 
been accepted into the University 
of Michigan, and therefore we 
will someday change the world. 
And despite the endless hours of 
stress that this institution will 
end up putting us through, there’s 
a sense of invincibility, a sense of 
invulnerability, that comes with 
being a University of Michigan 
student.

In many ways, this type of 

environment 
suits 
a 
college 

campus. It helps to foster ideas 
and creativity, and it encourages 
students to take the risks that 
will make them better workers 
and thinkers in the future. It’s 
this type of self-confidence that 
has inspired great thinkers and 
scholars for millennia. Accepting 
challenges that may or may not be 
out of one’s league has become a 
crucial part of the college process, 
and college campuses foster an 
environment that tells everyone 
they can and will succeed at 
whatever project they take on. 
Failure is a taboo word, never 
discussed and never accepted.

But Icarus flew too close to 

the sun, and likewise, Michigan 
students sometimes overstep their 
bounds. This happens all over the 
campus, when students decide 
to talk about topics they don’t 
necessarily understand, arguing 

for or against certain positions 
and then taking action based on 
those discussions. Especially in 
the case of social justice, students 
feel that because they took a 
sociology course or attended a 
protest that they are qualified to 
speak on behalf of a marginalized 
group they may not be a part of.

In some ways, this can be a 

positive thing; at least people are 
aware of and discussing issues that 
really are important to the world. 
But on the negative side, what type 
of information is being spread? 

Is this information truly helpful 
to the marginalized group, or is 
it actually working to silence and 
oppress these individuals more?

I recently attended a discussion 

about anxiety and depression 
where the facilitators had not been 
trained to talk about the specific 
topic at hand. As a result, one 
of the facilitators inadvertently 
insulted a participant for the 
decisions they made with their 
body. 
In 
their 
defense, 
the 

facilitators were very receptive to 
the criticism they received from 
the attendees. In my opinion, the 
organization, who does do great 
things on campus and of which I 
am a proud member, should have 

been more sensitive and hired 
trained professionals to host this 
dialogue.

This type of insensitivity is 

also 
prevalent 
in 
discussions 

regarding 
sexual 
assault 
on 

campus. I recently heard someone 
running 
for 
Central 
Student 

Government talk about this topic 
using heteronormative pronouns, 
with 
“her” 
referring 
to 
the 

survivor and “him” referring to 
the perpetrator. Using this type 
of language demonstrates a lack 
of awareness, as people within the 
LGBTQ community face sexual 
violence at a distressing rate and 
is detrimental as it takes away the 
voices of the people within this 
community, discouraging them 
from seeking help.

Here at the University, we are 

told that we can do anything. 
On this campus, people have 
found the inspiration to become 
doctors, writers, movie stars and 
politicians. 
This 
environment 

has cultivated some of the best 
learners and thinkers of our 
time. As students here, we are 
constantly being told that nothing 
is out of reach and that our work 
will someday change the world. 
But we are never told that in some 
situations it’s not our place to 
speak out, that it’s OK to be quiet. 
Though it may be hard, sometimes 
admitting you don’t know enough 
about an issue to act on it is the most 
impactful thing a person could do. 
I will freely admit there are a lot 
of issues I would not be confident 
to speak out on, knowing that 
my well-intentioned words could 
accidentally harm someone. In this 
type of situation, the best course of 
action is to educate oneself before 
moving forward.

W

ith the new $112 million 
renovation 
to 
the 

West Quad Residence 

Hall, 
pretty 
much 
everything 

has changed. Additional study 
spaces, improved plumbing and 
better Wi-Fi and computing have 
brought this residence hall into the 
21st century. While many things 
have been improved, a lot of the 
same aspects of the 1939 building 
remain in place, including the 
original names of every house in 
the building.

There are nine houses in West 

Quad, and most of them are pretty 
meaningful and are not a problem. 
For example, houses like Michigan 
House and Chicago House are 
named after places, Allen House 
and Rumsey House are named 
after the founders of Ann Arbor 
and other houses are named after 
famous professors.

However, there is one distinct 

house 
that 
is 
different 
than 

the rest. On the north side of 
West Quad, on the fourth floor 
lies 
Winchell 
House, 
named 

after a professor from the late 
1800s. Alexander Winchell was 
a professor of engineering and 
physics between 1853 and 1872 and 
of geology between 1878 and 1891. 

Like the namesakes of many 

other buildings on this campus and 
across the country, Winchell’s views 
on race are concerning. Winchell 
was a part of the “scientific racism” 
community, which, in short, tried 
to find biological proof of white 
supremacy. In 1878, he published 
a famous paper titled “Proof of 
Negro Inferiority,” which to him 
was proof that African and African-
American people were biologically 
inferior because of random physical 
features. In his paper, he performs 
many types of pseudo-scientific 
methods to prove this difference. 
This is truly a sickening read, with 
Winchell 
making 
comparisons 

between 
Black 
people 
and 

orangutans, and “proving” through 
body measurements the idea of their 
inferiority. This disgusting paper 
now circulates on white supremacy 
websites and is cited by some as 
justification for their racism. Later, 
in the 1930s when West Quad was 
built, someone decided to name 

a house after him, and the name 
stuck. Seventy-six years went by, 
and nobody noticed the obvious 
problem with naming a house after 
a racist person.

Across the nation, schools like 

Yale, Georgetown and Princeton 
have 
had 
large-scale 
student 

protests 
over 
the 
naming 
of 

buildings. Though there have been 
some successes, many complaints 
from students have been ignored. 
In Mississippi, students at the 
University of Mississippi pushed 
to change the name of Vardaman 
Hall, which ironically housed the 
Institute for Racial Reconciliation. 
Rather than changing the name, 
the university decided to put up 
markers and signs to embrace 
Vardaman’s 
past, 
rather 
than 

moving on from it. Last month, The 

Michigan Daily reported on a talk by 
Lawrence Ross, which highlighted, 
among other things, the struggle 
and failure of students at Clemson 
University to rename a building 
that is named after a former slave-
holding governor. The issue of 
building names is at the forefront of 
campus-climate issues today.

In January, I brought this matter 

to the University of Michigan’s 
attention and met with Marilyn 
De LaRoche, who is the director 
of University Housing. To the 
University’s credit, those I have 
talked to in University Housing 
have been more than helpful, and 
have assured me that they are 
investigating and trying to change 
the name. Unfortunately, issues 
like this, and the naming of any 
University-owned 
building, 
fall 

under the jurisdiction of the Board 

of Regents, a group that may be 
resistant to progress on this matter. 
On January 22, Regent Andrea 
Newman (R–Ann Arbor) tweeted 
that she thought the issue of 
building names was “an interesting 
discussion, but also a part of our 
history.” This tweet was responded 
to in agreement by Regent Mark 
Bernstein (D–Ann Arbor). Progress 
is hard to come by on an issue like 
this; however, progress is needed, 
and it is unacceptable to name 
spaces in buildings after people 
with such flawed views on race. We, 
as a community, need to move on 
from our racist past and embrace a 
more accepting future.

While some may argue that 

retaining 
building 
names 
on 

campus is a good way to remember 
our past as a university, I challenge 
them to think of the greater impacts 
of the name above that of simply 
the words on the door. Having 
memorials to our racist past is a step 
in the wrong direction. We must ask 
the question of whether or not the 
impact of this racially charged name 
is more harmful than letting go of 
the history of his name. In this case, 
and in many other cases, moving 
forward from our racist past is more 
important than remembering the 
man himself. 

I urge the University community 

to speak up. The name of Winchell 
House needs to be changed. We 
can’t set a tone of inclusivity and 
acceptance on campus if we have 
memorials to racists. Many argue 
that the names of buildings are a 
way to remember our history, but 
I’d like to provide another way 
that they can be beneficial. We as a 
community can use this as a chance 
to open up a community-wide 
conversation about the history of 
racism. We can and should talk 
about how much progress we’ve 
made, but how much further we 
have to go. Many buildings across 
this country are named after racist 
people, and in many cases, we may 
not even know it. By becoming 
aware of their history and the 
history of their namesakes, we 
can work together to make this 
campus a more inclusive place.

Japanese jazz hit 
‘Scenery’ excels 

By ANAY KATYAL

Daily Arts Writer

Thelonious Monk taught us 

the beauty of improvisation. 
Louis Armstrong helped us find 
fun in swing. 
Duke Ellington 
showed us the 
wonder and joy 
to be had with 
a big orchestra. 
Ryo Fukui had 
all the mate-
rial to make a 
similar impres-
sion on the world of jazz with 
the modal masterpiece that is 
1976’s Scenery, but among some 
of music’s biggest injustices, the 
lack of a global stage for musi-
cians of Fukui’s ilk is one of the 
most unfortunate. When listen-
ing to Scenery, it’s hard not to 
think about the countless other 
potential works of art that the 
Western musical zeitgeist has 
failed to account for.

Jazz’s liberating nature sepa-

rates it from other genres of 
music. Artists are free to stitch 
together a variety of styles and 
sounds effortlessly, affording 
them a significant level of cre-

ativity and improvisation. In 
Scenery, Fukui provides listeners 
a refreshing take on some jazz 
classics, like “Willow Weep For 
Me,” “Autumn Leaves” and “I 
Want To Talk About You.” While 
he relies on the works of other 
musicians, he has an undoubt-
edly unique take on every song. 
His rework of “Autumn Leaves” 
contains an eclectic, soulful 
introduction before he breaks 
into the slow, subdued jazz stan-
dard. While “Autumn Leaves” 
is an oft-used piece for begin-
ner jazz musicians to acquaint 
themselves with jazz harmony, 
Fukui still manages to create 
something original out of an 
otherwise rudimentary piece of 
music, adding an upbeat cadence 
and flair throughout the song. 
The drums are thunderous, 
but at the same time expertly 
restrained, and his keyboard has 
an air of both swing and finesse.

Even in his original arrange-

ments, the giants of jazz piano 
are 
channeled 
through 
the 

sounds of Scenery. Fukui’s style 
is immediately reminiscent of 
Bill Evans, and his modality 
recalls to life the masterpieces 
of the John Coltrane Quartet. In 

the track “Early Summer,” his 
transition between chill melo-
dies and slapping chord pro-
gressions culminates in a grand 
three minute solo, mirroring a 
lot of the grandiosity found in 
both Evans and Coltrane’s rep-
ertoire. Though Fukui remains 
calm in some arrangements, 
he switches gears on frenetic, 
seemingly improvised pieces 
like “Early Summer,” a fitting 
apex for the album.

While jazz in America was 

going through a crisis of iden-
tity and relevancy, Japan had an 
artist whose talent and adher-
ence to the purity of the genre’s 
sound created some of the 
world’s best, and most unno-
ticed, works of art. Scenery is 
both an expert homage to jazz’s 
best, and a damning illustration 
of an artist whose talent can 
almost match the musicians he 
honors. Scenery fuses elements 
of modal, bop and cool jazz, 
creating an unbridled spirit of 
majesty and excitement. While 
even some of jazz’s most loyal 
patrons may have failed to sur-
vey Fukui’s work, it’s never too 
late to rediscover the mastery of 
Scenery.

‘More Water’ flops by 
trap-rap standards

By HARRY KRINSKY

For the Daily

At one point during a Vice Media 

mini-documentary about Atlanta 
rapper iLoveMakonnen, the rap-
per eats an 
hallucino-
genic mush-
room, and as 
it hits him, 
he 
remarks, 

“I 
need 
a 

goddamn 
bed with the 
booth, 
you 

know 
what 

I’m 
saying, 

just lay down 
and record some shit.” It’s a funny 
moment and seems to (mostly) be 
a joke. It also explains the appeal 
of Makonnen’s sound better than 
any formal interview can. A peak 
Makonnen track sounds some-
where between the thoughts of a 
rapper about to go to bed and the 
thoughts of a rapper who just took 
shrooms, all the while percolating 
in a brain raised on the Atlanta 
trap-rap sound.

Unfortunately, 
Makonnen’s 

most recent EP, Drink More Water 
6, does not sound like the musings 
of a sleepy tripper. The tape, more 
than anything, sounds like the 
cold authenticity-killing power of 
a rapid rise to fame and a major 
record deal. This is Makonnen’s 
first major studio album. While it’s 
been marketed as a mixtape, and 
comes as the sixth installment of 
his Drink More Water series, this 
is his first commercial release. The 
album-mixtape ambiguity seems 
to manifest itself in the project. 
From top to bottom, Drink More 

Water 6 feels like a collection of 
Soundcloud releases, rather than 
an album. It’s not particularly 
unique, nor is it necessarily a 
misstep, for rappers to dump a 
bunch of tracks in a mixtape and 
release it without much thought — 
Lil Wayne seemingly did it every 
other month for a few years. If 
Drink More Water 6 was simply 
a free mixtape track dump, it 
still wouldn’t be very good, but it 
wouldn’t have been as much of a 
disappointment as it was.

Drink More Water 6 is, or at least 

should have been, Makonnen’s 
coming out party. He’s done the 
heavy lifting. He convinced the 
rap world that a goofy, shroom-
popping rapper with repetitive 
pseudo-melodic 
choruses 
and 

hard Atlanta beats can be absolute 
fire. He’s been featured on a Drake 
song and rapped on DJ Mustard 
and Carnage beats. In spite of all 
his recent success, Makonnen 
feels strangely risk averse on Drink 
More Water 6, as if his response to 
a major studio deal was to just not 
mess anything up for himself. On 
“Sellin,” and “Pushin’,” Makonnen 
sticks with rapping broadly about 
the drugs he sells, without much 
nuance to his angle. Even his love 
songs “Back Again” and “Turn 
Off the Lies,” which are rapped to 
an elusive female (or females) he 
refers to as “you,” don’t contain 
the relatable boyish emotion that 
makes “Second Chance” work. His 
hyped-up braggadocio tracks like 
“Uwonteva” and “Live for Real” 
don’t come close to the snarl-
inducing tracks like “Where Your 
Girl At?” and “I Live Tuh” from 
his 2015 campaign. It’s possible 
that “Solo,” probably Makonnen’s 

most unique track on the mixtape, 
could have worked if it were 
surrounded by equally strange 
songs. But on Drink More Water 6, 
the track alone doesn’t have a long 
shelf life, and by the third listen it 
starts to lose its initial appeal.

While the album is regrettably 

generic, it’s only generic by 
Makonnen’s 
standards. 
The 

album still has moments of the 
fun weirdness that characterize 
a peak Makonnen track. On the 
final track, where Makonnen 
best captures the hallucinogenic 
trap-rap fusion, he raps “two 
phones going ham, watch the 
bag triple double,” over a simple 
baseline, next to a subtle snare 
progression and under a whacky 
distorted set of echoing chimes. 
The line, along with the beat, 
is dripping with the duality of 
playful weirdness and serious 
subject matter.

Ultimately, 
though, 
this 

album does not exude the feeling 
that time or effort was put into 
it. It’s a set of throwaway tracks 
that aren’t even the good kind of 
throwaway tracks. Makonnen 
had the opportunity to harness 
all his pent-up strangeness and 
push the envelope on how far 
the Atlanta trap-rap sound can 
stretch. He had the opportunity 
to belt quirky yet witty lyrics in 
his tonally questionable voice 
and have the rap world eat it up. 
On Drink More Water 6, he did 
none of that, but the flop of an 
album will not come as a death 
sentence. Makonnen will have 
another chance to show the 
world what it’s like to fall asleep, 
trip, trap and rap, all at the same 
time.

‘Daredevil’ continues 
along a sinister road

By MEGAN MITCHELL

Daily Arts Writer

The cast of Marvel’s “Dare-

devil” has finally come into its 
own, entering the second season 
more comfort-
able in their 
roles 
than 

they 
were 

last 
season. 

The complete 
new season of 
the hit series 
began stream-
ing on March 
18, and since 
then, 
paus-

ing an episode has proven crazy 
difficult. Before the first appear-
ance of the vigilante Daredevil, 
the Marvel Cinematic Universe 
was solely characterized by shiny 
technology and the crisp suits 
of the Avengers. But when law-
yer-by-day, hero-by-night Matt 
Murdock (Charlie Cox, “Board-
walk Empire”) finally graced our 
screens, we were taken to the 
darker, sexier side of Marvel.

Showrunners 
Doug 
Petrie 

(“American Horror Story”) and 
Marco Ramirez (“Orange is the 
New Black”) helm the new sea-
son of “Daredevil,” taking the 
reigns from predecessor Steven 
DeKnight (“Spartacus”). So far, 
they’ve been sprinting ahead with 
the figurative baton. This season 
sees the addition of the Punisher 
(Jon Bernthal, “The Walking 
Dead”) and Elektra (Elodie Yung, 
“Gods of Egypt”), who, at first 
appearance, are meant to jux-
tapose the actions of Daredevil, 
but ultimately end up encour-
aging them. Where a stark line 
once stood between the actions of 
Murdock and season one antihero 
Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio, 

“Jurassic World”), season two 
explores the morally gray area 
that comes with vigilantism. It’s 
obvious that Petrie and Ramirez 
are taking a different approach to 
“Daredevil,” putting Murdock’s 
hero under the same scrutiny that 
Christian Bale’s Batman under-
went in Christopher Nolan’s “The 
Dark Knight.”

The season begins strongly 

as Matt struggles to balance his 
dual identities despite the urging 
of partner and longtime friend 
Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson, 
“Mockingjay: Part 2”) to give up 
the mask. As a break from the 
secrecy of the first season, it’s 
refreshing to have Foggy in the 
loop on Matt’s late-night activi-
ties, and this season, he seems to 
be acting as the voice of reason. 
Although we may have prema-
turely pinned Foggy as the side-
kick to Murdock’s Daredevil, 
Nelson is taking over as a solid 
force in the series, shining in the 
duality of sarcasm and serious-
ness. Another driving force in the 
show, Karen Page (Deborah Ann 
Woll, “True Blood”), becomes 
more comfortable in her skin, fall-
ing into the trio smoothly with 
her strong will and unwavering 
loyalty to the clients of Nelson & 
Murdock.

Just as the characters begin to 

find balance in the mayhem, the 
unanticipated return of Elektra, 
a past lover of Murdock’s with a 
taste for blood, begins to deterio-
rate Matt’s relationships. In the 
beginning, the audience is enticed 
by Elektra, with her suave, ninja-
esque moves. Slowly, her sadistic 
thirst for vengeance breaks her 
facade, showing something much 
darker beneath the mysterious 
exterior. Especially since Karen 
and Matt have just begun to act 

on the spark of their relationship, 
Elektra’s arrival comes at a really 
a bad time.

As the trial of the century 

between the DA’s office and Nel-
son & Murdock over the fate of 
the Punisher begins, we see Matt 
choosing to abandon Foggy at the 
trial’s most crucial point, chip-
ping away at their friendship right 
at the hinges. As the season goes 
on, it becomes harder to endorse 
Daredevil’s actions. Considering 
the second episode showcases 
Foggy’s desperate plea that Matt 
end his days as Daredevil, worried 
that his actions will ultimately 
lead to his demise, it’s irritating to 
see Matt fail to reciprocate Foggy’s 
loyalty. Petrie and Ramirez are 
making it increasingly difficult 
to root for Murdock as the series 
progresses. Surprisingly, the only 
common feature of the first and 
second seasons of “Daredevil” is 
the cinematography. There’s one 
stairwell fight scene that is so 
smoothly choreographed and sty-
listically pulled off that it could’ve 
easily appeared in the first season.

Overall, “Daredevil” seems to 

be balancing on the cliff between 
one of Marvel’s rare treasures and 
the cinematic graveyard. Hope-
fully, the slightly rushed plot lines 
that characterize the first epi-
sodes of the season will be outli-
ers compared to the smoothness 
that eventually characterizes the 
following episodes. If “Daredevil” 
is picked up for another season, it 
should focus on this smoothness 
so the series doesn’t burn through 
plot too fast. As far as the cinema-
tography and character portrayal 
is concerned, though, “Daredevil” 
might just be headed towards 
the same pedestal as “The Dark 
Knight” if they play their cards 
right.

Not really sure what’s going on here.

Lichtenstein-esque 
‘Sixty Six’ exuberant

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

1960s pop art and Greek 

mythology collide in a dizzying 
explosion in Lewis Klahr’s collage 
film 
series 

“Sixty 
Six.” 

Paper 
cutouts 

of Lichtenstein-
esque 
blondes 

scuttle 
through period 
magazine 
imagery, 
background 
prints 
and 

photographs of modernist LA 
architecture in dynamic stop 
motion. It’s the Silver Age of 
Greek mythology played out with 
the pulpy suspense and visual 
identity of the Silver Age of comic 
books.

Unlike 
some 
experimental 

films, Klahr’s work usually has 
a fairly defined, linear narrative, 
but an idiosyncratic method of 
reveal. He creates a scrapbook-
like collage, physically overlaying 
flat cutouts and 3D found objects, 
then intercuts them with digital 
imagery, flashes of bold color and 
soapy sound bites that guide the 
storyline.

The twelve films in the series 

work together as chapters of 
a larger storyline, one which 
switches easily between ominous 
melodrama and playful irony. 
“Helen of T” features a time 

period appropriate jazz to follow 
a seductive blonde grappling with 
the loss of her youth and beauty. 
He then switches visual styles in 
“Mercury,” a short fight between 
comic book superheroes. Choppy 
cuts hover in on various small 
details — the point where a punch 
meets or a muscle straining — 
sparking motion to what was once a 
static physical image. Then there’s 
“Ambrosia,” a respite from graphic 
imagery, focusing on banquet table 
photographs alone to tell a story 
of the guests unseen. “Lethe,” 
inspired by the eponymous river 
flowing through the Underworld, 
draws revolvers and top hats 
from slick noir cinema for a bored 
housewife and mad doctor’s romp 
through death and rebirth.

Klahr says his films are from the 

“present tense, looking back”: that 
is, situating present iconography 
within the context of ideas that 
lead up to it. Cultural symbols may 
define an era, but aren’t exclusive 
to it. “Sixty Six” revives found 
imagery to uncover what relics 
of history have stuck and what 
they’ve become. After all, Greek 
myths were once narrative fodder 
for popular entertainment, just as 
the Pop Art movement drew from 
mass culture.

Still, calling “Sixty Six” a 

modern retelling of traditional 
archetypes doesn’t encompass 
the complexity of its scope. 
Klahr sources from an eclectic 
variety of well-known cultural 

markers, 
but 
disregards 
the 

chronological 
continuum 
that 

structures the ideas. He hints at 
how past ideas inform modern 
thought, 
but 
spends 
more 

time reversing it, finding fresh 
angles on things that have now 
wormed their way into collective 
consciousness. He meshes images 
together, then flings them in 
unexpected directions so all of 
these threads of perspective — 
Greek mythology, 60’s culture 
and the modern viewer — are at 
once recontextualized under his 
interpretation and stripped of 
context to create building blocks 
that the viewer can rearrange 
themselves.

He invites viewers to engage 

with the films within the context 
of their own lives, prefacing the 
screening 
by 
recommending 

that audiences unfamiliar with 
experimental film approach his 
series like listening to music. 
Just as song lyrics re-enter the 
mind during completely different 
situations than the original song, 
Klahr says because these cultural 
markers are already absorbed 
deeply into American popular 
culture, reassembling them is 
“about the way we personalize 
those images,” as Klahr said in

an 
unparalleled 

exuberance that truly does inspire 
audiences 
to 
make 
nostalgic 

imagery their own.

‘The Bronze’ not 
funny as intended

Sundance darling 
doesn’t stick the 

landing

By MADELEINE GAUDIN

Daily Arts Writer

Once upon a time, Hope 

Ann Gregory (Melissa Rauch, 
“The Big Bang Theory”) was 
America’s sweetheart. She won 
the titular bronze in the 2004 
Olympics 
and with it, 
the hearts of 
fans 
across 

the 
United 

States.

Twelve 

years 
later, 

back at home 
in Amherst, 
Ohio, 
not 

much has changed in Hope’s 
mind. She’s still an “American 
hero” deserving of free food 
at the mall food court. Except 
there’s a new child prodigy 
in town and, following the 
death of Hope’s old coach (and 
some 
complicated 
business 

with her inheritance money), 
Hope is forced to step up and 
help Mighty Maggie (Haley 
Lu Richardson, “The Young 
Kielowski”) on her path to 
stardom.

“The 
Bronze” 
takes 
its 

time getting to that so-called 
stardom. Hope initially sets 
Maggie up for failure, filling her 
with junk food, Avril Lavigne 
and a highly potent “green” 
smoothie. Then a quick change 
of heart alongside the promise 
of money turns her around. 
From there, Hope must struggle 
with 
being 
an 
absolutely 

miserable person and her fear 
that 
Maggie’s 
success 
will 

overshadow her own.

Rauch plays the insufferable 

Hope perfectly. So perfectly, 
in fact, that she’s absolutely 
unbearable 
to 
watch. 
She 

swears in a thick Midwestern 
accent 
and 
snorts 
Claritin 

each morning to start her day. 
She bullies everyone from her 
angelically patient dad (Gary 
Cole, “Tammy”) to her weed 
dealer. While her abrasiveness 
and complete lack of self-
awareness are clear attempts 
at comedy, Hope induces more 
cringing than laughing.

Poor Thomas Middleditch 

(“Final Girls”) seems destined 
to play the same twitchy nerd 
he always does. This time he’s 
Ben, the nervous gym assistant 
and Hope’s eventual (read: 
inevitable) love interest. Who 
could ever love someone like 
Hope, you might ask? Only this 
guy, who she is relentlessly 

cruel to. 

“The Bronze” tries to break 

free of its formulaic narrative 
by throwing in as many plot 
twists as it can. It twists and 
turns so much that it finds itself 
in much the same place where 
it began. Loyalties change and 
change back and change back 
again. People fall in love on and 
off the high bars. “The Bronze” 
actually does its best when it 
sticks to the narrative formula. 
But it tries too hard to surprise 
its audience. In the end, things 
are (somehow) resolved and, 
by some miraculous salvation, 
Hope is not the absolute worst 
person ever.

“The 
Bronze” 
is 
almost 

funny. In its quieter moments, 
it’s entertaining — a sweet 
moment 
between 
Ben 
and 

Hope is peppered with gentle 
awkwardness and Ben asking 
Hope if she tapes down her 
boobs in an attempt to tell her 
she’s pretty just the way she 
is. But, unfortunately, “The 
Bronze” relies too heavily on 
the 
crutch 
of 
raunchiness, 

favoring crude sex jokes and 
swearing over well-developed 
humor.

So “The Bronze” doesn’t stick 

the landing, that’s clear. But 
even worse, much like its main 
character, it doesn’t know when 
to quit.

AAFF documentary 
shorts not compelling

By ANA LUCENA

Daily Arts Writer

It’s not easy to generalize 

the variety of films shown at 
this year’s Ann Arbor Film 
Festival, but solitary living was 
a running thread in the tenth 
set of shorts 
that 
were 

screened 
on 

March 
20. 

The 
strong 

production 
value 
and 

quality 
of 

subjects 
and 
actors 

filmed 
was 

consistent 
throughout.

The 

collaboration 
of 
several 
countries 

was 
showcased 
as 
well, 

demonstrating how film can 
allow diverse groups of people 
to coalesce. This was most 
notable in the documentary 
“Le Boudin,” in which German 
teenager Elias Greißler shares 
his experience of being forced 
into the French Foreign Legion. 
Portuguese filmmaker Salomé 
Lamas effectively strengthens 
the authority of Greißler’s story 
by splicing it with testimony 
from Portuguese serviceman 
Nuno 
Fialho. 
The 
striking 

similarities between the two 
men’s 
experiences 
brings 

gravity to the young man’s 
scary time in military service 
with another country. The 
fact that the two subjects are 
so distant in age and country 
of origin makes the issue 
addressed in the documentary 
all the more real.

The highlight of the set is 

the 
documentary 
“Omnia,” 

by Amena Al Nowais of the 
United Arab Emirates. Omnia, 
a 
young 
Egyptian 
woman, 

retells a horrifying childhood 
experience when she was in 
excruciating pain and could 
not use her legs to get away. 
Her blunt, simple language 
powerfully 
conveys 
her 

suffering as a result of female 
genital mutilation the way she 
felt it, without any preconceived 
ideas clouding her truth. This 
piece understandably received 
the most applause.

Several of the short films 

covered 
the 
daily 
routines 

of individuals with unique 
occupations, 
which 
became 

repetitive. “The Digger” shows 
Pakistani 
caretaker 
Zeib 

Kahn, who tends to a massive, 
pre-Stone 
Age 
graveyard 

in an Emirati desert. Other 
than a few shots of preserved 
skeletons in high-tech facilities, 
the short film mainly consists 
of a lone man traversing the 
desert for 24 minutes. There’s 
little activity onscreen to merit 
such a long running time. At 
one point, a car with exuberant 
music blasting through the 
windows zooms past Kahn. 
At that moment, I pitied the 
caretaker, who feels obliged 
to preserve nature without 
so much as a thank you. But 
it also made me question why 
the filmmaker found his story 
compelling.

“Sorelle Povere Di Santa 

Chiara,” 
or 
“Poor 
Clares” 

in English, tells the story of 
a monastery in San Marino 
committed to living in poverty, 
but it’s more of a series of 
photographs than a narrative. 
The monastic morning routine 
documented 
by 
the 
film 

consists of sewing, cooking, 
ironing, tending the garden 
and taking care of livestock and 
crops. With such a mundane 
subject, I’m disappointed that 
filmmaker Nina Danino didn’t 
go beyond the surface of these 
nuns. Investigating why these 
elderly women are committed 
to such a lifestyle would have 
made a far more interesting 
portrait of their lives.

“Baba Dana Talks to the 

Wolves” was more successful 
in its attempt to paint a portrait 
of an unusual lifestyle. In the 
short, 85-year old woman Baba 
Dana lives by herself in the 
Bulgarian mountains without 

electricity 
and 
most 
other 

modern conveniences. She has 
become very good at identifying 
and handling encounters with 
the local wolves. The lovely 
panning shots of her house and 
surroundings capture how she 
lives without taking away focus 
from its subject. The warm 
colors of the film convey the 
high regard held towards the 
rural woman.

Many of the short films 

take advantage of the scenic 
landscapes they were filmed in 
by using gorgeous establishing 
shots. Though this technique 
makes the films feel more like 
postcards than stories at times, 
it’s still fascinating to see the 
beauty of faraway lands. This 
is most evident in “Solace,” 
in which a girl goes through 
cycles of setting the table inside 
her plain, silent house, and 
taking care of chickens in the 
beautiful outdoors, alive with 
the songs of birds. The actors 
never speak in the film, robbing 
“Solace” of the opportunity to 
explain its intentions through 
dialogue. The conclusion of 
the film is puzzling, as the girl 
takes matters into her own 
hands when a source of conflict 
is never directly presented. 
That being said, the farm she 
lives on is very pretty.

The filmmakers of two of 

the short films were present 
at the screening: “Solace” ’s 
Katarzyna Plazinska and “Baba 
Dana” ’s Ralitsa Doncheva. 
After the show, they discussed 
the 
sources 
of 
inspiration 

for their work. Their answer 
was short: they wanted to 
capture the landscape of their 
hometowns, both in Eastern 
Europe. Other than that, little 
explanation was offered to 
help deepen my understanding 
of their work. When asked for 
questions from the audience, it 
wasn’t surprising that they got 
none. Their films’ thin plots 
spoke for themselves.

Though the set of short 

films is a mixed bag, it was 
a 
worthwhile 
experience 

to attend. It was a fantastic 
opportunity to see work from 
around the world, in no small 
part because they were well 
done. The main problem was 
the lack of dramatic tension: 
why am I compelled to see 
people 
repeat 
what 
they 

normally do? Hopefully these 
filmmakers will fight for their 
audience’s attention more in 
the future.

Believe in Erik Bakich

I

n 2012, the Michigan 
baseball team was an 
afterthought.

The Wolverines finished 

with a 22-34 
record and 
their second 
straight 
10th-place 
finish in 
the Big Ten under coach Rich 
Maloney.

But in late May of that year, 

Maloney’s contract wasn’t 
extended, and the head coaching 
vacancy was left to be filled.

At the time, Erik Bakich was a 

young face who was the perfect 
fit to re-energize the oldest 
varsity sport at Michigan. Bakich 
started as a volunteer assistant 
and hitting coach at Clemson 
in 2002 — coaching a team that 
reached the College World Series 
later that season. From 2003 to 
2009, he worked as the hitting 
coach and recruiting coordinator 
at Vanderbilt. In every one 
of his seven seasons with the 
Commodores, he had a top-25 
recruiting class. He was then 
hired at Maryland for his first 
head coaching gig.

Though his record didn’t 

jump off the page, he secured 
the Terrapins their first ranked 
recruiting class in school history.

Wherever Bakich went, success 

seemed to follow. He established 
a reputation as one of the most 
prolific recruiters in college 
baseball, and it was this reputation 
that led him to Michigan.

“I was immediately drawn 

into his energy,” said graduate 
student outfielder Matt Ramsay, 
who transferred to Michigan 
during the summer of 2015. 
“When I first visited with him, 
I was like, ‘Does this guy ever 
stop? How am I supposed to keep 
up with his energy?’ ”

On Bakich’s first day on campus 

in 2012, his presence was felt 
immediately. At his introductory 
press conference, Bakich assured 
that Michigan baseball would 
be winning championships at a 
consistent rate.

It’s no easy task to take a 

team with a losing record into 
championship contention, but the 
Wolverines’ record has improved 

every year since Bakich became 
the skipper, and they are on pace 
to continue that trend once again 
in 2016.

Though it seems that Bakich 

is primarily focused on winning, 
many of the Wolverine players 
have stressed that Bakich’s main 
goal each year is to make each 
athlete the greatest teammate 
and student they can be.

“We have 

a saying, 
‘Champions 
behave like 
champions 
before they 
become 
champions,’ ” 
Bakich said. 
“Of course, 
everyone 
wants to win a 
championship 
at Michigan, but we don’t go 
into our training thinking about 
outcomes and statistics and titles. 
We talk about being the highest 
and best version of ourselves 
every day, knowing that those 
external things will take care of 
themselves later in the season.”

The athletes don’t just admire 

what Bakich has done for 

them, but also how he works to 
improve himself.

“He never stops talking about 

(getting better every day),” 
Ramsay said. “He never stops 
practicing it. You can see it when 
he’s out there on the field. He’s 
trying to get better as a coach. It’s 
one thing to say it to your players, 
but it’s another thing to practice it 
as a head coach.”

Added 

junior utility 
player Carmen 
Benedetti: 
“He’s 
implemented 
so many 
things into my 
game that has 
allowed me to 
slow the game 
down, enjoy it 
and realize that 

it’s just a game. I couldn’t ask for a 
better coach.”

The team’s hot start cannot be 

disregarded, however. Michigan 
headed into this season with the 
expectation of maintaining the 
Big Ten Tournament title and has 
already shown championship-
caliber play with victories over 
top-25 opponents California and 

Oklahoma State.

Michigan isn’t winning 

national championships just 
yet, but the team secured its 
first Big Ten title since 2008 
last season. Bakich has made 
baseball at Michigan relevant 
again. He has inspired a culture 
in the locker room that seeks to 
create talented athletes and well-
rounded characters. And like 
his time at Clemson, Vanderbilt 
and Maryland, the success has 
followed with time.

“I’m extremely excited about 

this team and the opportunities 
in front of us,” Bakich said.

It’s hard not to get excited. 

Though the 2016 season is just 
getting underway and the Big 
Ten title is up in the air, Michigan 
is right up there at the top of 
the standings. The Wolverines’ 
starting pitching ranks in the 
top-10 nationally in earned-run 
average, and the batting order has 
also shown flashes of brilliance.

If it wasn’t apparent when he 

was first hired, it should be very 
clear now: It’s time to believe in 
Erik Bakich.

2016 Baseball Preview
Breaking down Michigan’s roster

By NATHANIEL CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

While the Michigan baseball 

team lost some firepower from 
last year’s offense that won the 
Big Ten Tournament, there is still 
considerable talent on the roster. 
Below, the Daily breaks down the 
2016 Michigan squad.

Outfield

The departure of centerfielder 

Jackson 
Glines, 
who 
was 
a 

10th-round pick in June, leaves 
big shoes to fill from last year’s 
offense. 
Glines 
finished 
the 

2015 season with a .369 batting 
average, an on-base percentage of 
.440, five home runs, 83 hits and 
34 runs batted in — the latter two 
were both good for third best in 
the Big Ten.

But there is a returning starter 

from last year to fill the vacancy: 
senior center fielder Cody Bruder, 
who has taken up residence in 
the fifth spot in the Wolverines’ 
batting order. Bruder is currently 
hitting .353 with 24 base hits and 
15 RBIs. He possesses the third-
highest batting average on the 
team, the third-highest hit total 
and the second most RBIs.

Junior right fielder Johnny 

Slater has also seen significant 
playing time of late. Though he 
recorded nine multi-hit games in 
2015, and came up with several 
clutch at-bats during Michigan’s 
late-season run, he has been 
struggling at the plate so far this 
season. His batting average is 
sitting at .185 and he has mustered 
just 10 hits.

Beyond the returning starters, 

there are some newcomers to the 
outfield, most notably senior left 

fielder Matt Ramsay, who arrived 
in Ann Arbor this year as a transfer 
from Wofford College. Ramsay 
has been productive in the second 
spot, with a .294 batting average, 
20 hits and 14 runs scored.

Infield

Any 
assessment 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ infield must take 
into account the departure of first 
baseman Jacob Cronenworth to 
the Tampa Bay Rays. He started 
in each of Michigan’s 64 contests 
last year, when he posted a batting 
average of .338, hit 18 doubles and 
three triples, smacked six home 
runs, drove in 48 runs and was 
the Big Ten Tournament’s Most 
Valuable Player.

Junior first baseman Carmen 

Benedetti has been tasked with 
filling Cronenworth’s role. And 
Benedetti is ideally suited to 
do so, having hit .353 last year 
with a Big-Ten-leading 71 RBI 
and conference-best 25 doubles. 
While Benedetti’s 2016 batting 
average is only .298 at the 
moment, history suggests that 
number may climb during Big 
Ten play after hitting .398 over 
the conference season last year.

Another player who has been 

asked to fill big shoes is senior 
catcher Harrison Wenson, who 
is taking over for Kendall Patrick, 
Michigan’s home-run leader last 
season. Wenson has embraced 
the role so far, as he has posted 
a .386 batting average, hit three 
home runs, driven in 16 runs and 
manufactured 22 base hits. His 
stats earned him possession of the 
cleanup spot in the Wolverines’ 
batting order.

Sophomore Jake Bivens — 

who was moved from second 

base to third base this season 
— has been a force in the leadoff 
spot thus far for the Wolverines. 
He leads Michigan with a .389 
batting average, 28 hits, 16 RBI 
and a 1.062 OPS (the sum of 
on-base percentage and slugging 
percentage). His speed has also 
shown with four stolen bases so 
far, which is nearly half of his total 
of nine in 2015.

Designated Hitter

Sophomore Drew Lugbauer is 

Michigan’s starting designated 
hitter. Lugabuer’s hitting has 
improved greatly from last year, 
and he has already driven in four 
more runs than his 2015 total 
before the start of conference play.

Lugbauer was highly touted for 

his raw power when he came to 
Michigan, and he is showing that 
much more this season than he 
did last year.

Starting Pitchers

Sophomore left-hander Oliver 

Jaskie has been the strongest 
starter so far for the Wolverines. He 
is 3-1 in four starts while compiling 
a 1.69 earned-run average, striking 
out 21 and giving up 13 hits in 21.1 
innings. 
Jaskie’s 
performance 

earned him Big Ten Pitcher of the 
Week honors twice during non-
conference play on Feb. 22 and 
March 7. Jaskie’s strength comes 
from the fact that he is capable of 
pitching a solid fastball, changeup, 
curveball and slider.

Junior Brett Adcock came 

into 2016 as the pitcher with the 
most hype after being named 
to the College Sports Madness 
Preseason Big Ten First Team. 
While his record sits at 1-2, his 

stats tell a different story. Adcock 
has tallied a 2.89 ERA and 32 
strikeouts, 
holding 
opposing 

hitters to a .103 batting average. 
He struck out 12 against Hawaii 
on Mar. 11, but he did not earn the 
victory as the bullpen squandered 
a 4-1 lead in the ninth inning 
before Michigan won the game, 
5-4, in the 10th.

Senior left-hander Evan Hill 

has played a much bigger role 
on the team this year after being 
sidelined for the first two months 
of last season with an injury. Hill’s 
2016 record stands at 3-1, and 
his earned run average is 2.84 
through 19 innings.

Relievers

Sophomore Bryan Pall is 1-0 

as Michigan’s primary closer so 
far this year with two saves. In 
9.1 innings pitched, he has given 
up three earned runs and six 
hits while striking out 16. His 
lone blemish came in the form of 
a blown save on Mar. 11 against 
Hawaii, when he gave up three 
runs in the ninth inning.

Junior Keith Lehmann is a 

veteran presence delivering in 
Michigan’s bullpen and has yet to 
give up a run in 6.2 innings.

One newcomer has logged 

significant 
innings 
for 
the 

Wolverines: freshman William 
Tribucher. In 13 innings this year, 
he has compiled a 2.08 ERA, and 
struck out 17.

Unlike 2015, when Michigan was 

buoyed by a high-powered offense 
and wins and losses depended on 
the pitching performance, the 2016 
Wolverines are anchored by their 
pitching staff and their five losses 
are attributable to an up-and-
down offense.

Big Ten Preview: 
Michigan, MSU 
the frontrunners

In-state rivals off to 
strong starts; Ohio 

State, Nebraska 
not far behind

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

Daily Sports Writer

The 2016 Michigan baseball 

team has all the makings of a 
perfect storm. 

It’s just the fourth year under 

Michigan coach Erik Bakich and 
his staff, but it’s shaping up to be 
one of the most successful yet, 
after the best season start since 
2009 with five straight wins.

The 
2015 
Michigan 
team 

went to the NCAA Tournament 
for the first time since 2008. 
Though the Wolverines lost at the 
NCAA Regionals, this year could 
potentially see national play 
beyond that point. 

At the start of the 2016 

season, Michigan was picked 
by a committee of conference 
coaches as the favorite to win 
the Big Ten Championship. This 
prediction could play out well 
for the Wolverines, who were the 
only nationally ranked team in 
the conference. 

For those who are eager for 

a look at what lies ahead, the 
Daily breaks down the teams 
that will compete for the 
coveted Big Ten title.

Michigan State (15-3)

Michigan 
State 
— 
ranked 

sixth in the Big Ten preseason 
polling — has started to shed its 
historic underdog coat and make 
significant program strides. This 
year, the team was ranked in the 
top 25 for the first time since 1988 
by Baseball America. To start off 
the season, the Spartans had a hot 
start with a 14-game win streak, 
the best in program history. 

The Spartans are currently the 

only team in the country to rank 
in the top 10 in the country for 
both batting average (.333) and 
earned-run average (2.28), good 
for sixth and eighth, respectively. 

Despite averaging 7.1 runs 

per game and allowing just 16 
earned runs in 55 innings, the 
team managed to rebound off a 
losing streak that might be the 
difference in beating out the 
Wolverines for the top spot in the 
conference. Their first contest 
will be Friday, April 29.

Michigan State has the third- 

and fourth-best players in the 
conference in junior infielders 
Dan 
Durkin 
and 
Jordan 

Zimmerman, respectively. Durkin 
has a .421 batting average and, like 
Zimmerman, has started all 17 
games this season. Zimmerman 
boasts a .418 batting average and 
is in his first season with the 
Spartans after transferring from 
Mesa Community College. 

Michigan State did not earn a 

berth in the NCAA Tournament 
for the 2015 season, nor did it 
advance past the third round of 
the Big Ten Tournament. 

This year, the Spartans don’t 

look like they’ll let that happen 
again. 

Ohio State (12-6-1)

The Buckeyes are on a four-

game winning streak heading 
into conference play, led by senior 
infielder Nick Sergakis, who 
ranks fifth in Big Ten with a .419 
batting average. Sergakis will be a 
player to look out for when he’s on 
the basepaths as he’s scored in all 
19 games.

One player does not a great 

team make, as the Buckeyes didn’t 
even make it onto any preseason 
polls. The 2015 Ohio State team 
couldn’t make it out of the second 
round of Big Ten Tournament play 
and lost in the NCAA regionals.

The 2016 Ohio State team has 

one of the largest senior classes 
with a total of 10 players — the 
majority were starters or key 
reserves on the 2015 team. The 
experience and maturity on the 
team will definitely help the 
Buckeyes, but won’t guarantee 
them a strong season finish. 

The team is in the top five for 

many Big Ten offensive statistics, 
including first in home runs — 
21 in 19 games so far — and runs 
batted in.

Nebraska (13-7)

The Huskers finished the 2015 

season without an NCAA bid and 
just scraped out of the first round 
of Big Ten Tournament before 
losing quickly in the second. 

Nebraska hasn’t made any 

national polls, but might have 
an ace up its sleeve with left-
hander Ben Miller or left-hander 
Jake Meyers. The junior and 
sophomore, respectively, have 
led the Huskers on a four-game 
winning streak and don’t show 
signs of slowing down. Nebraska 
potentially could be a formidable 
opponent for Michigan.

Harrison Wenson 
hitting his stride 
in his junior year

Catcher has become 

a fixture in the 

Wolverines’ lineup

By COLE ZINGAS 

Daily Sports Writer

From the minute he set foot on 

campus, junior Harrison Wenson 
expected to start at catcher. 
Cracking the starting lineup 
was not a far-fetched prospect, 
and he was the frontrunner for 
the job in each of his first two 
seasons. But each time, Wenson 
couldn’t maintain his status as a 
starter. 

He graced the lineup early 

in the season as a freshman in 
2014 but soon dropped out of the 
everyday rotation. After playing 
in just 22 games that year, he saw 
even less time in his sophomore 
campaign — appearing in just 12 
contests.

In 
a 
year 
when 
fellow 

underclassmen 
Jake 
Bivens 

and Carmen Benedetti helped 
lead the team to a Big Ten 
Championship, Wenson couldn’t 
carve out a spot in the lineup, 
frustrated by inconsistency, both 
at the plate and behind it.

But it wasn’t his size and 

strength that kept him off the 
field.

Wenson came in as a 6-foot-3, 

220-pound 18-year-old, plenty 
big enough to compete for a spot 
as the starting catcher. He was 
drafted by the Detroit Tigers 
out of high school — one of just 
three players in his graduating 
class in the state of Michigan to 
be selected. Physically, the pro 
scouts thought he was ready, 
and so did Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich.

“Harrison’s a guy who has 

always 
had 
an 
outstanding 

physical skill set,” Bakich said.

In addition to an impressive 

build, Wenson had the intensity 
needed for the job.

“His motor 

never 
stops 

pumping,” 
said 
fifth-

year 
senior 

outfielder Matt 
Ramsay. “He’s 
always hitting 
in 
the 
cage 

super 
early, 

and if you’re 
not, he’s going 
to 
give 
you 

grief about it.”

Wenson has dedicated himself 

both in the cage and in the 
weight room, gaining 20 pounds 
in the last two years.

To 
him, 
life 
is 
about 

competition, which speaks to an 
innate drive he doesn’t expect to 
slow down. Wenson has always 
been an intense competitor — a 

trait instilled by his father, Paul, 
a Michigan baseball legend 
who played from 1984 to 1986 
— so his work ethic was not the 
problem, either.

Instead, the biggest challenge 

was between his own ears. 

“If you think too much, it’s 

gonna bite you right in the butt,” 
Wenson said. “In baseball, you’ve 
got 
to 
have 

consistency, 
and 
I 
didn’t 

have 
that 

whatsoever.” 

To 
gain 

the 
mental 

consistency he 
was 
lacking, 

Wenson 
took 

a 
page 
out 

of 
fifth-year 

senior catcher 
Dominic Jamett’s book. 

“Dom, throughout the last 

three years, has really helped 
me out. I’ve never really had a 
big brother, but I can definitely 
look at him like a big brother,” 
Wenson said. “Baseball’s about 
consistency, and Dom brings 
consistency in everything he 
does.”

Added 
Jamett: 
“We’ll 
be 

doing a blocking drill, and we’ll 
constantly try to one-up each 
other. There’s a lot of trash 
talking that goes on between us, 
but at the end of the day, we’re 
just happy to be teammates.”

Through a steady approach on 

the field and endless work ethic 
this season, Wenson has avoided 
the mental peaks and valleys, 
which has taken his game — both 
offensively and defensively — to 
the next level.

And 
with 
a 
consistent 

mindset has come consistent 
playing 
time. 
Wenson 
has 

started every game thus far for 
the 12-5 Wolverines, impressing 
his coaches with his bat and his 
prowess as a defensive catcher. 
Bakich 
has 
seen 
Wenson’s 

development and rewarded it 

— he moved 
Wenson 
into 

the 
cleanup 

spot, 
and 

Wenson 
has 

no intention of 
giving it up.

Wenson has 

stepped up at 
key 
moments 

this 
season 

in the middle 
of the order. 

He leads the team with a .596 
slugging percentage and has 
knocked in 16 runs — good for 
second in the Big Ten.

Against 
Hawaii, 
the 

Wolverines relinquished a three-
run lead in the ninth and were 
on their heels heading into extra 
innings. Wenson came to bat in 
the 10th with Ramsay in scoring 

position, and smashed a single 
to score Ramsay and put the 
Wolverines ahead for good, 5-4. 

In that game, and throughout 

the first stretch of the season, 
Wenson has provided an essential 
big bat behind Benedetti, a 
preseason 
All-American. 
But 

the Farmington Hills, Mich., 
native has added much more 

than power to 
the Wolverine 
lineup.

In the series 

against 
No. 

22 
Oklahoma 

State, 
with 

runs 
hard 

to 
come 
by, 

Wenson 
proved he was 
an 
exception. 

With two outs 

in the fifth, Wenson worked the 
count full. He laid off the final 
pitch of the at-bat, drawing his 
11th walk of the year. This set the 
table for the Wolverines to score 
a run, which ended up being the 
game-winner.

“If he’s starting an inning, 

he does a great job of drawing a 
walk and seeing pitches for the 
rest of the guys hitting behind 
him in the order,” Ramsay 
said. “He does an absolutely 
wonderful job of setting the table 
when he needs to and driving in 
runs when he needs to. Having 
someone like that in the middle 
of the lineup is crucial.”

And beyond his patience and 

toughness in the batter’s box, 
Wenson has proven himself a 
leader.

His coaches, as well as his 

teammates, have recognized a 
huge step up in his voice within 
the locker room. His desire to 
succeed extends beyond himself, 
and Ramsay pointed out that 
Wenson is always trying to 
push his teammates to their full 
potential.

“He’s always got your back,” 

Ramsay said.

Wenson has always had a 

strong personality, and now, as 
an upperclassman, he is making 
that strong voice heard. His 
leadership, along with a clear 
mind and a hot bat, bodes well for 
Michigan. The Wolverines hope 
Wenson’s growth will eventually 
translate into improvement for 
the team in the postseason — 
which means building on a 2015 
Big Ten Tournament title.

The last time the Wolverines 

went to the College World Series, 
it was 1984 and Harrison’s father 
was on the roster. It took 30 
years for another Wenson to join 
the roster and two more for him 
to get comfortable. But now, as 
Harrison Wenson hits his stride, 
he’ll hope to help Michigan 
recapture the same success his 
father had.

AMANDA ALLEN/Daily

Junior catcher Harrison Wenson (far right) is finally starting to gain consistency and realize his potential this season. 
Now, as an upperclassman, he hopes to become a leader of a team on a Big Ten title chase after an NCAA berth in 2015.

“If you think too 
much, it’s gonna 
bite you right in 

the butt.”

“His motor never 
stops pumping. 

He’s always hitting 

in the cage.”

Newsome settling in

Sophomore ready to 
step in at left tackle 
after learning from 
Mason Cole in 2015 

By KELLY HALL 

Daily Sports Editor

Last 
season, 
as 
a 
true 

freshman, offensive lineman 
Grant 
Newsome 
had 
some 

misgivings about his ability to 
face a true Big Ten defensive 
line during a game.

But in his first appearance 

against Minnesota, he realized 
that his daily combat with the 
nation’s fourth-best total defense 
was enough to prepare him for 
game time. This offseason, he 
still gets to go up against what 
he thinks is one of the best 
defensive lines in the country.

“We get to practice, as an 

offensive line, against one of 
the best defensive lines, if not 
the best defensive line, in the 

country every day,” Newsome 
said. “Football-wise, it was a 
great experience to get that 
learning experience on the field. 
At the same time, it wasn’t as big 
of an adjustment as I thought it 
would probably be just because 
of how great our defensive line 
is, and that was positive.”

Now, Newsome frequently 

lines up across from Chris 
Wormley and Taco Charlton in 
practice. Newsome says he can 
hold his ground, but against 
a defense that’s so stout, he’s 
always going to be battling in 
practice.

“Who aren’t some of the 

toughest guys to block out 
there?” Newsome said. “They’re 
just so talented, we’re so deep. 
We’re going to have two or three 
lines defensively who are just 
absolute studs.”

Furthering 
Newsome’s 

comfort on the field is the 
constant 
direction 
he 
has 

received 
from 
offensive 

lineman 
Mason 
Cole. 
Cole 

has two years of starting 

experience as a junior, and 
following 
offensive 
lineman 

Graham Glasgow’s graduation, 
Cole is expected to take over 
at center after playing two 
seasons at left tackle. As the 
natural successor as left tackle, 
Newsome has a true mentor in 
Cole.

Throughout this offseason, 

Newsome has gone to Cole for 
any question he might have, 
even likening Cole’s football 
knowledge to that of Glasgow’s. 
It also doesn’t hurt that of the 
five 
offensive 
linemen 
who 

played regularly last season, 
four will be returning, including 
fifth-year seniors Kyle Kalis, 
Ben Braden and Erik Magnuson.

“There’s 
definitely 
some 

pressure (this season), but I 
think it’s more pressure I put on 
myself to keep up the standard 
that Mason set,” Newsome said. 
“It’s definitely been good, but 
there’s definitely a long way 
to go. … (Cole) is so football-
smart. He’s just got it all down. 
Whenever I can tap his brain, I 
love doing that.”

In 2015, though Newsome 

enjoyed 
receiving 
playing 

time, he valued his bench 
time reviewing the starting 
offensive line’s dynamics. The 
combination of playing and 
studying helped Newsome, and 
now he feels more than ready 
this offseason.

Last summer was his first 

offseason experience, and after 
hustling to keep up with some 
of his early-enrollee teammates, 
the first three months felt like 
a whirlwind. This time around, 
though, he knows what it’s like 
to play under the lights and 
won’t be anxious about getting 
his first game under his belt.

“It was nice that I had 

that buffer year to get that 
experience and, at the same 
time, watch Mason,” Newsome 
said. “I really got to understand 
the tools of the trade through 
him and (offensive coordinator 
Tim Drevno).”

Now, with the spring season 

reaching its peak at the Spring 
Game next Friday, Newsome 
will be able to showcase his 
freshly 
honed 
abilities 
and 

confidence on the field to try to 
win the job.
