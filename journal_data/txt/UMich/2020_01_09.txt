ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The 
Regional 
Transit 
Authority 
of 
Southeast 
Michigan (RTA) is looking 
to make travel between Ann 
Arbor and Detroit less of a 
hassle. 
The RTA held a public 
hearing about a potential new 
bus service, in collaboration 
with 
TheRide, 
connecting 
the two cities on Wednesday 
evening at the Ann Arbor 
District Library. About 40 
people attended the public 
hearing about the new pilot 
bus service looking to connect 

the two major cities. 
Matt 
Webb, 
general 
manager of the RTA, said the 
pilot program aims to connect 
Ann Arbor and Detroit in a way 
that other transport services 
do not provide by evaluating 
the market ridership between 
the two communities to cater 
the service to them.
“We will also use this to test 
the effectiveness and build 
the ridership base, so when 
the 
Michigan 
Department 
of 
Transportation 
looks 
to 
rebuild 
I-94 
in 
the 
future, it might be a viable 
transportation 
alternative 
that is already in place, and 

ridership and people will be 
comfortable and already used 
to the service,” Webb said.
The pilot program will 
provide 
a 
bus 
service 
connecting downtown Detroit 
and downtown Ann Arbor. 
This service will provide an 
hourly direct route between 
the Blake Transit Center (Ann 
Arbor) and Grand Circus Park 
(Detroit). It will operate from 
6 a.m to 10 p.m. on Mondays 
through 
Fridays 
with 
a 
limited weekend schedule. 
Some 
attendees 
had 
concerns concern about the 
limited 
weekend 
schedule. 
Yuri Popov, an Ann Arbor-

Detroit commuter, praised the 
availability of the bus service 
during 
the 
weekdays 
but 
expressed his concern about 
the weekend schedule. 
“While 
the 
weekday 
frequency is excellent, I think 
the weekend frequency can be 
improved further,” Popov said. 
“With only four round trips 
per day, it is still comparable 
to the existing services. The 
main 
recreational 
riders, 
particularly U-M students, 
might be using this service if 
it is more frequent.” 

The 
Whitmer 

administration is looking to 
tackle poverty in the state.
Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 
signed an executive order 
on Dec. 18 creating a task 
force within the Department 
of 
Labor 
and 
Economic 
Opportunity (LEO) to focus 
on the impact of poverty on 
families and communities in 
Michigan. 
The 
Michigan 
Poverty 
Task Force will meet for 
the first time this month, 
working both to understand 
the impact of poverty in local 
communities and to advise 
the governor on how best to 
uplift 
Michigan 
residents 
from poverty.
According 
to 
the 
2019 
United Way Asset Limited, 
Income 
Constrained, 

Employed Report, 43 percent 
of 
Michigan 
households 
struggle to afford necessities 
such as food, housing, child 
care and healthcare. The 
report cites the combination 
of 
increasing 
costs 
of 
living with low wages and 
reduced hours as a source of 
inequality.

Following the U.S. airstrike 
that killed former Iranian 
Major 
General 
Qasem 
Soleimani on Jan. 3, hundreds 
of students, faculty and Ann 
Arbor community members 
organized 
Wednesday 
outside Angell Hall for a 
demonstration against U.S. 
imperialism 
and 
potential 

war in Iran. 
The event featured nine 
different speakers, including 
students 
from 
various 
multicultural 
organizations 
on campus and a University 
of Michigan professor. Each 
spoke against potential war 
in Iran and related their 
personal experiences to the 
events 
happening 
in 
the 
Middle 
East. 
LSA 
junior 
Amytess Girgis emceed the 

demonstration.
 
People 
gathered 
in 
solidarity at the event to 
oppose 
the 
imperialistic 
tendencies of the American 
government, 
Girgis 
said. 
As 
an 
Iranian-American, 
she told The Daily she felt 
especially devastated by the 
recent events.
“We’re 
Americans, 
and 
we’re really, really frustrated 
with 
the 
way 
that 
our 

administration 
is 
acting 
and the degree to which 
it 
can 
militarize 
around 
the 
world 
without 
many 
repercussions,” Girgis said. 
“So, as an Iranian-American 
and as an American, and as 
someone who cares about 
people here and around the 
world, I am frustrated.”
Political 
tensions 
between Iran and the U.S. 
span several decades, and 

have been escalated by the 
recent airstrike. The Trump 
administration 
and 
the 
Pentagon claim they decided 
to strike against Soleimani 
to protect Americans from 
a future Iranian attack and 
because 
past 
actions 
of 
Soleimani had resulted in 
the deaths of hundreds of 
Americans.
Iran retaliated by releasing 
more than a dozen ballistic 

missiles at two military bases 
in Iraq that housed about 500 
members of the U.S. military. 
There were no casualties. 
In response, Trump gave 
an 
address 
Wednesday 
morning, saying Iran seems 
to be standing down but that 
he will be imposing new 
sanctions on Iran.

demonstration, 
University 
professor Juan 
Cole 
said 

Soleimani’s 
death 
was 
highly 
unwarranted 
and 
that the U.S. should not go 
to war with Iran.

“We have to make a stand 
against unjust war,” Cole 
said. “The killing of General 
Soleimani 
was 
not 
the 
killing just of a bad guy. It 
was an assassination … We 
have a rogue government. 
It’s a government we cannot 
trust 
with 
our 
security 
or our lives, and the way 
forward with Iran is the 
way of peace, not a war.” 
Public Policy senior 
Arwa Gayar, president 
of the Arab Student 
Association, 
explained 
her 
frustration 
with 
the 
separation 
between 
people 
in 
her 

community and their loved 
ones, 
unsure 
about 
the 
safety of their families. 
“I already see members of 
my community questioning 
if they can return back to 
their home and see their 
families 
in 
the 
coming 
months,” Gayar said. “Many 
of us … are already forced 
to leave our own home 
countries, due to the U.S. 
history 
of 
imperialism, 
American 
wars 
in 
the 
Middle East and legacies of 
colonialism. We now find 
the security of our families 
unknown once more.”
LSA 
sophomore 
Noah 
Streng told The Daily he 
came to the demonstration 
because he wanted to help 
people who were suffering 
in the Middle East.
“When I see the Trump 
administration 
escalating 
the war and assassinating 

foreign officials in order to 
invade a foreign power, that 
is very alarming to me,” 
Streng said. “So I want to do 
everything I can to prevent 
the deaths of millions of 
more people due to U.S. 
interests.” 
Streng 
said 
all 
Americans 
should 
do 
what they can to protect 
Iranians whose lives are 
being put at risk.
“I think that working-
class people in the United 
States 
have 
more 
in 
common 
with 
Iranian 
working-class 
people 
than they do American 
billionaires,” Streng said. 
“We should be standing 
in 
solidarity 
with 
the 

families, 
the 
innocent 
people who are living in 
Iran, who will die due to 
our government’s actions 
in their nation — our illegal 
actions in their nation.”
A 
group 
of 
students 
from the Persian Students 
Association 
ended 

the 
demonstration 
by 
performing a spoken word 
poem about some of the 
challenges and experiences 
of being Iranian-American.
Counter-protesters 
in 
favor 
of 
American 
intervention in the Middle 
East 
and 
in 
support 
of 
Soleimani’s 
assassination 
were also present throughout 
the demonstration. Many 
attendees 
engaged 
in 
disputes with the counter-
protesters 
about 
their 
differences in policies. LSA 
senior 
Courtney 
Weigal, 
a 
counter-protester, 
said 
she 
believes 
the 
killing 
of 
Soleimani 
was 
fully 
justified.
“When 
it 
comes 
to 
looking at … all the build-
up 
to 
the 
situation, 
all 
the provocation, it’s just 
common 
sense 
that 
you 
have 
to 
retaliate 
back, 
otherwise they’re going to 
keep pushing and pushing 
at you, and I mean we could 
have had another Benghazi 
with that situation,” Weigal 
said. “A lot of people just 
don’t understand just how 
dangerous Iran is right now 
and just because you’re anti-
war for America doesn’t 
mean that war still won’t 
happen anywhere else.”
The event also focused on 
how to move forward and 
learn from these situations, 
according 
to 
Girgis. 
Those who organized the 
demonstration 
plan 
on 
hosting teach-in events over 
the next several weeks in 
Washtenaw County to help 
people better understand 
the situation in the Middle 
East.
Zaynab 
Elkolaly, 
Ann 
Arbor City Commissioner, 
spoke at the demonstration. 
She 
said 
she 
found 
attending anti-war rallies 
encouraging. 
“You all being here has 
given me hope; you are the 
hope,” Elkolaly said. “If we 
continue to mobilize, and 
continue to show not only the 
Trump administration but 
every single administration, 
whether it’s Republican or 
Democratic, that we will not 
be silenced, we will not give 
our tax dollars to another 
war, that’s when we will be 
victorious.”

“If we continue

not only the Trump

but every single

However, Broekhuizen 
was unable to confirm 
Wang’s 
enrollment 
as 
multiple students at the 
University have the same 
name. 
All 
students 
with 
Wang’s name are enrolled 
in 
Rackham, 
according 
to 
MCommunity, 
the 

University’s 
digital 
student directory.
An affidavit filed in 
federal 
court 
by 
FBI 
Special 
Agent 
Chris 
Kelttheimer 
claimed 
the U.S. Navy Security 
Forces were able to locate 
Wang and Zhang after 30 
minutes and discovered 
they possessed a Nikon 
camera and cell phones. 
After obtaining consent 
to look at the devices, 
U.S. Navy Security Forces 

discovered they contained 
photographs 
of 
Sigsbee 
Annex 
and 
military 
buildings on Fleming Key.
“Jielun Zhang explained 
they continued onto the 
property, driving around 
until they stopped, parked 
the 
vehicle 
and 
took 
photographs 
with 
his 
camera and videos with 
his 
cellular 
telephone,” 
Klettheimer wrote in the 
affidavit. “Jielun Zhang 
voluntarily showed agents 

the 
photographs 
and 
videos on the camera and 
cellular telephone he took 
while on Sigsbee Annex.”
Both Wang and Zhang 
first appeared in federal 
court on Monday with 
Magistrate Judge Lurana 
Snow and asked her to 
appoint lawyers able to 
represent 
them. 
Snow 
allowed a public defender 
for Wang and a private 
attorney for Zhang.
The 
Detroit 
News 

reported that both Wang 
and 
Zhang 
said 
they 
each had $9,000 in a U.S. 
bank which they were 
using 
for 
University 
tuition payments. Snow 
asked that the two each 
contribute $7,500 to the 
cost of their defense.
Wang 
and 
Zhang’s 
pretrial detention hearing 
in Key West is scheduled 
for Friday.
Zhang did not respond 
to an email from The 

Daily. 
This comes after two 
additional cases in which 
Chinese nationals were 
arrested for taking photos 
of the base in Key West. 
This is a developing 
story. Please heck back 
at michigandaily.com for 
more information.

Another concern was the 
actual location of the bus stop 
in Ann Arbor. Resident Clark 
Charnetski 
said 
the 
Blake 
Transit Center is not the best 
bus stop for those commuting 
from Detroit.
“People coming to Ann Arbor 
are coming to the Blake Transit 
Center and that isn’t usually 
their 
ultimate 
destination,” 
Charnetski said. “They may 
want to go to Central Campus, 
North Campus or the Medical 
Center. There may be a need 
for a shuttle service, possibly 
provided by the University.”
Attendees 
also 
suggested 
advertising the service better, 
implementing 
a 
later 
bus 
service for people commuting 
to Ann Arbor or Detroit for 
late-night events.
The proposed base fare for 
the bus service will be $12, 
one-way. By advance booking a 
passenger seat 15 minutes before 

the bus leaves, passengers can 
save $2. Senior citizens and 
people with disabilities receive 
a $6 discount. 
Earlier that day, the RTA 
held another public hearing in 
Detroit where residents and 
commuters expressed similar 
concerns about the frequency of 
the service as well as the fare.
“In Detroit, we heard a lot 
of comments regarding the 
fare and a lot of comments 
regarding extended service,” 
Webb said. “They like the 
hourly frequency.”
Webb also mentioned similar 
concerns about the later service 
during the weekdays and the 
weekend. 
It’s unclear when the service 
will begin running, as the RTA 
is currently going through the 
public comment period and will 
later have to get approval with 
the RTA board. The RTA will be 
accepting public concerns and 
comments until Jan. 13.

In a Dec. 18 statement, 
Whitmer 
emphasized 
the 
importance of prioritizing 
efforts to combat poverty.
“No parent should have 
to choose between paying 
rent and putting food on 
the table for their families,” 
Whitmer said. “That’s why 
I’ve charged this task force 
with identifying more ways 
we can lift families up and 
ensure they can build a good 
life for themselves here in 
Michigan.” 
The task force will include 
an advisory council of three 
state legislators — two who 
represent urban areas and 
one who represents a rural 
area — and three residents 
who have experienced the 
impacts of poverty or work 
with those who do.
LEO Director Jeff Donofrio 
explained the value of taking 
a 
collaborative 
approach 
towards this issue. 

“There’s no one solution 
to solve poverty, it’s going 
to take all of us, putting 
our shoulders to the wheel, 
to 
make 
real 
progress,” 
Donofrio said. “The Task 
Force gives us the chance to 
do collectively what none of 
us could accomplish on our 
own.”
Laura 
Rall, 
president 
of 
Affordable 
Michigan 
and School of Social Work 
student, believes Whitmer’s 
task force is a positive step 
in terms of validating low-
income students.
“For 
students, 
like 
me, who come from low-
income backgrounds, seeing 
poverty 
being 
addressed 
at the state level validates 
our 
experiences 
and 
can 
potentially change the stigma 
around 
being 
low-income, 
especially on a campus like 
(ours),” Rall said. “By having 
people express interest and 
initiative in the experiences 
those in poverty face, I think 
there’s potential for a lot of 
good work to be done.”

Rall believes it is crucial 
for the state to make an effort 
to fully understand the needs 

of those living in poverty. 
“I do hope that the task 
force uses qualitative as well 
as 
quantitative 
measures 
in its evaluation, however, 

because I think it’s important 
to hear directly from those 
experiencing poverty what 
impact it’s had on their 
lives,” Rall said. “This task 
force is by no means going to 
solve the poverty crisis, but 
I do support the initiative 
Governor Whitmer’s taking 
to fight for the alleviation of 
poverty.”
Rall 
expressed 
some 
concern about the advisory 
council’s ability to represent 
all of those living in poverty, 
however.
“I do wish that the advisory 
council to the task force had 
more people on it, especially 
for a state as big as Michigan,” 
Rall said. “I am definitely 
biased here, coming from 
a 
rural 
low-income 
area, 
but I wish there would be 
more representation of rural 
poverty, especially because 
rural versus urban poverty 
can look very different.”

Call out China: Uyghurs repression

C

hina has always seen 
Islam as an extremist 
threat 
and 
sought 
to 
tighten control over those who 
practiced the faith — namely the 
Uyghur Muslims. Though China 
has long denied any maltreatment 
of the ethnic minority living in 
its Xinjiang province, a recent 
document leaked by a Chinese 
official confirmed the existence 
of Uyghur detention camps. The 
documents included a manual 
on how to operate and maintain 
these centers, which exploit 
the Uyghurs through forced 
labor 
and 
brainwash 
them 
into 
accepting 
government-
approved propaganda. Not only 
is this practice a violation of 
human rights, but the response 
to China’s oppression of this 
minority 
group 
has 
been 
underwhelming.
Human rights have always 
been a touchy subject in China, 
but the problem is that some of the 
individuals who are detained are 
not Chinese citizens. Now that 
there is finally concrete evidence 
of human rights violations in 
China, other countries need 
to step in and call on China to 
dissolve the internment camps 
and protect the rights of the 
Uyghurs, especially if China 
has no jurisdiction over some of 
the detainees. Though China is 
part of the United Nations, other 
member countries should stand 
up and do the right thing; the 
values of freedom and tolerance 
that the U.N. stands for should be 
upheld by all of its constituents. A 
lot of the problems surrounding 
China’s take on human rights 
and 
its 
actions 
toward 
the 
minority group stem from the 
way its government is run — the 
Communist Party works as a 
cohesive unit, dictating policy 
and maintaining control through 
censorship and propaganda. In 
this case, the government has 
labeled the Uyghurs a threat on 
the basis of terrorism — without 
much basis — and is taking control 
of the situation by concealing 
the truth about what it is really 
doing. While foreign nations 

and organizations like the U.N. 
cannot do anything to change the 
fundamental structure of China’s 
governance and society, they can 
put pressure on China to change 
its approach toward the Uyghurs.
Though China has already 
threatened the progress of trade 
talks with the United States, 
other countries should try to step 
in. An economic conflict should 
not deter countries from doing 
what is right and standing up for 
human lives. The U.S. cannot let 
China continue to torture and 
punish the ethnic minority over 
an ideology and belief system the 
Uyghurs practice; there is also no 
evidence of any supposed acts of 
“terrorism” China is vehemently 
taking 
action 
to 
contain. 

Regardless of the situation, there 
is no excuse to lock anyone up 
for re-education and exploit 
them for labor. One conflict of 
interest is that the U.S. has been 
accused of mistreating prisoners 
in Guantanamo Bay, which may 
make any action it takes come 
off as hypocritical. While it is 
true Americans need to address 
our own faults, we should not let 
them deter us from taking a firm 
stance on the issue.
Furthermore, there is a lack of 
attention devoted to this issue. 
While articles have been written 
about it, they have largely flown 
under the radar. Lives were risked 
to bring the truth to light, yet there 
has been little official response. 
Chinese citizens are finding ways 
to access the article published in 
The New York Times, which has 
paved the way for transparency 
on the government’s actions. The 

response of these citizens vary, 
but the fact they are going as 
far as breaking censorship laws 
to get the truth should prompt 
us to give more attention to the 
problem. The role technology 
and media have been playing in 
this is disappointing — TikTok 
temporarily silenced talk about 
Uyghurs when it deleted a post 
made to bring awareness to what 
China has been doing. While it 
has been said TikTok is trying to 
distance itself from its Chinese 
roots, it could do better to assert 
that 
separation 
by 
allowing 
the post to stay up as a way of 
standing up to the Communist 
Party. 
There 
are 
so 
many 
organizations and individuals 
who 
now 
have 
access 
to 
indisputable evidence of China’s 
human 
rights 
violations, 
yet nothing has been said to 
acknowledge the issue on a 
national or global scale. If the 
news and media can consistently 
report on Hong Kong and their 
fight for rights and democratic 
freedom, there should be no 
reason why they cannot do the 
same to give voice to an oppressed 
minority.
Maybe 
the 
difference 
to 
these large news outlets is Hong 
Kong’s attempt to separate itself 
from Communist Party control 
and espouse more “American” 
democratic 
values, 
but 
the 
Uyghurs have done nothing to be 
locked up in internment camps. 
Taking a stance on Hong Kong 
may seem less problematic 
because it technically does 
not count as overstepping on 
Chinese authority, but that 
does not excuse inaction. If 
anything, we should champion 
their 
freedom 
of 
religion 
regardless of whether or not the 
concept exists under Chinese 
sovereignty. If the U.S. wants 
to be a leader, it should act 
accordingly; we cannot simply 
turn a blind eye when it is more 
convenient to do so.

Michael Bloomberg’s dangerous rhetoric on China
R

ecent 
Democratic 
entrant into the 2020 
U.S. 
presidential 
race 
Michael 
Bloomberg 
has faced criticism for 
a series of comments 
he made about the 
Chinese government. 
In an interview he 
gave in September of 
2019, the billionaire 
founder of Bloomberg 
and former Mayor of 
New York City made 
the claim that Chinese President 
Xi Jinping is “not a dictator,” 
and that his leadership exists 
as a result of enduring public 
support in China. Sen. Ben 
Sasse, R-Neb., notably spoke out 
against Bloomberg’s statement 
defending Xi Jinping, calling 
it “nonsense.” Sasse has been a 
frequent critic of the Chinese 
regime, 
its 
well-documented 
human rights abuses and its 
overall authoritarian behavior. 
He is but one of the many 
Americans 
that 
understand 
the true nature of the Chinese 
regime.
Bloomberg’s comments are 
deeply problematic. For a man 
seeking to be the leader of the 
free world, he seems unaware 
of the extent of China’s efforts 
to clamp down on freedom for 
their own citizens and even, 
at times, those of Americans. 
Under 
Xi 
Jinping, 
Beijing 
has 
created 
mass 
detention 
and indoctrination camps for 
millions of Uyghur Muslims 
in China’s Xinjiang province. 
Footage from overhead drones 
has shown prisoners handcuffed 
to each other and blindfolded, 
while reports on the camps have 
indicated that the prisoners 
are, among other requirements, 
forced to pledge loyalty to the 
Communist Party of China and 
Jinping himself.
Even outside of China, Xi 
Jinping and the CPC are exerting 
their influences to stifle dissent 
and gain further control. The 

pro-democracy protests in Hong 
Kong have seen Chinese-backed 
authorities perpetrate brutality 
against the students 
who 
are 
simply 
demonstrating 
their 
support of autonomy 
from Beijing. People 
have 
been 
beaten, 
shot and arrested in 
connection with the 
protests, which have 
been taking place since 
June 2019. China has 
also tried to use its economic 
influence and large population to 
prevent criticism of its policies, 
as seen with its conduct towards 
the NBA in October.
These are just a few examples 
of Beijing’s actions that are 
emblematic 
of 
totalitarian 
dictatorships. Xi Jinping has 
proved his hostility to free 
speech, a willingness to oppress 
minorities and utter opposition 
to giving real autonomy to 
citizens. 
Bloomberg, 
in 
his 
interview, said that Xi Jinping 
is in power because of the desire 
of the Chinese people. What 
would the Uyghurs say about 
that claim? Would the students 
of Hong Kong share Bloomberg’s 
view that Xi Jinping listens to 
“the will of the majority?”
Bloomberg’s sentiments appear 
more delusional when one considers 
the 
makeup 
of 
the 
Chinese 
government and the changes that 
have taken place under Xi Jinping. 
He has consolidated his own power 
by abolishing his term limits and 
giving himself the final say on 
issues across all realms of political, 
economic and social life. This is 
not the behavior of a democratic 
leader who seeks to operate 
according to the will of his people. 
These are the actions of a despot 
who was never directly elected by 
the Chinese population, enjoys a 
parliament that is completely loyal 
to him and seeks only to preserve 
his own grip on power. If that 
conduct isn’t emblematic of a 
dictator, what is?

As a candidate for president, 
it is concerning that Bloomberg 
does not recognize the true 
nature 
of 
China’s 
political 
leadership. While his company 
has documented ties to China 
and a history of controversy in 
that regard, it should still be 
expected that Bloomberg, as 
a political figure, be informed 
about the country that many 
of his Democratic competitors 
have called the biggest threat 
to the U.S. If Bloomberg wasn’t 
a presidential candidate, his 
company’s connection to China 
would just be the concern 
of 
Bloomberg’s 
investors, 
consumers, 
employees 
and 
himself. Yet at this point, his 
political 
views 
toward 
the 
country, combined with his 
company’s record in China, can 
and should be scrutinized by the 
American public — particularly 
voters.
Whether in the realm of 
trade or international politics, 
China 
serves 
as 
perhaps 
the chief competitor of the 
U.S. This fact should not 
prevent 
peaceful 
relations 
between the two countries. 
It 
should, 
however, 
cause 
a future administration to 
operate with skepticism and 
be unafraid to publicly call 
China out on what it currently 
is and has been for quite some 
time: 
a 
dictatorship. 
Any 
politician who remains timid 
about acknowledging that fact 
may be too timid to put the 
U.S. in a strong position to 
counter China’s rise to global 
prominence. 
Americans 
should 
be 
wary 
of 
any 
candidate who shows they are 
unwilling to stand up to Xi 
Jinping and show the world 
that America still provides a 
superior system of leadership 
and that civil liberties are 
worth protecting.

Give us the time needed to vote

T

he University of Michigan 
prides itself on being 
a 
civically 
engaged 
institution. 
From 
hosting 
a 
presidential debate to engaging in 
voter turnout competitions, the 
school has touted its commitment 
to voting and political engagement. 
However, this is not enough: if the 
University truly wants to empower 
students to be active and informed 
participants in our government, 
it should work to give us the time 
needed to make it to the polls. 
The voter turnout rates of 
Michigan students in the past few 
elections have been shockingly low. 
In 2014, only 14 percent of eligible 
University students voted. This 
number was so low that it inspired 
Professor Edie Goldenberg to found 
the organization Turn Up Turnout, 
which engages students and faculty 
and helped nearly triple voter 
turnout in 2018 to 41 percent. 
While this is a powerful increase, 
it still means that 59 percent of 
eligible students did not vote that 
year. 
Even in 2016, when Michigan 
was a key swing state in the 
presidential race, only 44.7 percent 
of University of Michigan students 
voted. 
One likely cause for these 
numbers is that students lack 
the necessary time to get to the 
polls. A Pew research study from 
2014 found that among registered 
voters who chose not to vote, 67 
percent said they did not have the 

time to vote, and of that group, 35 
percent had specific work or school 
conflicts.
This is something that I think all 
college students can understand. 
Between classes, studying, activities 
and jobs, it can be hard to find a 
free moment in the day, much less a 
few free hours to go and vote. This 
is especially true for low-income 
students, who are often working 
multiple jobs. 
Getting to the polls from campus 
can be a struggle in itself. The 
city of Ann Arbor has divided the 
area around the campus into five 
electoral districts, meaning that 
many students live far away from 
where their polling place is. Given 
that many students do not have 
access to a car, they have to walk 
long distances or wait for public 
transportation in order to vote, both 
of which take time.
Once students get to the polls 
they can sometimes face two hour 
waits, as was seen in Ann Arbor in 
2016. 
As we head into the 2020 
election, there will likely be many 
“get out to vote” efforts on campus, 
including registration drives, voting 
themed events and the buzz around 
hosting a presidential debate. All 
of these factors will likely lead to 
higher levels of voter turnout in 
2020. While this is a great thing, it 
also means that there will be even 
longer lines at the polls. 
The most effective way to solve 
this problem would be for the 

University to cancel classes on 
Election Day. This would allow 
students the time needed to make it 
to the polls and perform their civic 
duty. As a pragmatist, I recognize 
that the chances of the University 
closing on election day are quite 
small. 
However, 
individual 
professors have a great deal of 
leeway over whether they hold 
classes that day. One of the best ways 
for students to ensure they and their 
fellow classmates have the time to 
vote is by addressing the issue with 
their professors. Even if professors 
choose not to cancel class they can 
decide not to take attendance or not 
hold any assessments on that day. 
Even these small actions can make 
a big difference in encouraging 
students to go vote. 
Some may argue that students 
would view this simply as a free 
day and not use the time to go to 
the polls. However, I have faith 
in my fellow students. So many of 
us are passionate about different 
issues. We chose this university 
because of its reputation as a place 
of engagement. We want to vote and 
we want the University to give us 
all the time and resources needed 
to make that a reality. That is why 
we must push to cancel classes on 
Election Day and help us become 
a community where all students 
have the opportunity to make their 
voices heard.

The dichotomy of the self

I 

am happy to have noticed 
that recently there have 
been more and more women 
straying away from 
the 
stereotypical 
definition of what it 
means to be a “girl” 
or “woman.” They do 
this by setting fitness 
goals, working three 
campus 
jobs 
on 
top of being a full-
time University of 
Michigan 
student 
to achieve financial stability 
or a level of independence and 
by founding conferences and 
summits that empower their 
fellow female executives. It’s 
interesting to witness how by 
not conforming, we are in a 
way actually embracing and 
harnessing 
all 
the 
power 
that a woman or young girl 
encompasses 
to 
redefine 
preconceived 
notions 
set 
by 
societal 
standards. 
As 
we continue to shed light 
on 
gender 
inequities 
that 
exist, like the gender pay gap 
(particularly the widening pay 
gap between women of color 
and their male counterparts), 
the TIME’S UP campaign has 
been on a positive mission 
to 
highlight 
successful 
women. This is exactly the 
type 
of 
advancement 
we 
need 
to 
support. 
However, 
this 
campaign 
and 
similar 
initiatives 
are 
just 
some 
examples of representing one 
demographic and deepening 
the divide between who we 
are and how we see ourselves. 
Another term for this sentiment 
rampant 
amid 
all 
college 
students with high-achieving 
goals is imposter syndrome. 
It’s easy to compare ourselves 
to 
trailblazers 
and 
other 
professionals in our future 
career 
fields 
and 
wonder: 
Where do I fit in?
A Harvard Business Review 
article 
titled 
“Overcoming 
Imposter Syndrome” defines 
imposter syndrome best as 
a term used to describe a 
collection of feelings of anxiety 
despite evident success. I’d 
recommend 
expanding 
the 
definition 
to 
apply 
to 
all 
individuals in all stages of life, 
not only working women or 

minorities making large-scale 
strides within their fields. The 
syndrome can affect anyone 
whose 
social 
identities result in 
feelings of being an 
outsider. However, 
imposter syndrome 
is typically talked 
about 
within 
the 
context 
of 
the 
working 
environment 
post-
graduation. 
Yet 
when I look around me, I 
recognize imposter syndrome 
to be rampant throughout the 
University’s 
undergraduate 
community. Whether or not 
you want to label it imposter 
syndrome is entirely a personal 
choice, but I’m sure feeling like 
you don’t belong in a certain 
space is not a foreign concept 
to most.
A 
study 
titled 
“An 
Examination of the Impact 
of Minority Status Stress and 
Imposter Feelings” conducted 
by Dr. Kevin Cokley, an ethnic 
minority professor in his field 
of educational psychology and 
African diaspora studies at the 
University of Texas at Austin, 
addresses the additional stress 
that discrimination adds to the 
minority student experience. 
The results indicate that while 
feelings of impostorism further 
complicate 
the 
minority 
experience, the mechanisms 
by which we receive and 
respond to imposter syndrome 
is specific to the individual. 
Dena Simmons’ Ted Talk 
on How Students of Color 
Confront Impostor Syndrome 
expands on this concept of 
imposter 
syndrome 
being 
heterogeneous. 
Her 
talk 
is 
essentially 
an 
in-depth 
analysis of feeling like a fraud 
or that you don’t belong in 
a field or space. Simmons 
emphasizes 
that 
“there 
is 
emotional 
damage 
done 
when young people can’t be 
themselves. When they are 
forced to edit who they are 
to be accepted. It’s a kind of 
violence.” 
Simmons and Dr. Cokley 
touch base on what we can 
do to reduce the trauma we 
induce upon ourselves from 

imposter 
syndrome. 
The 
strategies proposed by The 
New York Times in “Dealing 
With 
Imposter 
Syndrome 
When You’re Treated as an 
Imposter” are easily applicable 
at the University. One strategy 
is to find a “you” in your 
chosen field. For example, if 
you’re a woman of color, find a 
professor who represents your 
identities in the classroom. By 
understanding the challenges 
that exist in the field, you’ll 
be better equipped to handle 
impostorism. While this may 
be the route less taken, when 
you experience a situation 
where you do not feel welcomed 
in a classroom space, reach 
out to the GSI or a faculty 
member and let them know. 
By far the most important 
technique is to find a platform 
to encourage yourself to keep 
moving 
forward. 
Whether 
this is through journaling or 
writing a Post-It note with a 
list of your accomplishments, 
find a method that allows you 
to be comfortable with your 
achievements. 
At the end of the day, the 
pervasiveness 
of 
imposter 
syndrome is a sign we are 
conditioned to feel that there 
is always more to achieve. 
So let’s make an effort to 
be kinder to ourselves. In 
the classroom setting, let’s 
do our best to create an 
environment where it’s a safe 
space, you’re allowed to be 
wrong, you’re allowed to ask 
“basic” questions and you’re 
allowed to explore. Despite 
social media trends and what 
we might tell ourselves, self-
care isn’t just about taking 
time out of your day to put on 
a face mask and watch Netflix 
or take a break from academia 
to play Overwatch. It’s about 
not letting our success pass 
without 
celebration 
and 
finding 
areas 
for 
growth 
within the failures. As Dena 
Simmons 
asserts, 
“Every 
child deserves an education 
that guarantees the safety to 
learn in the comfort of one’s 
own skin.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Thursday, January 9, 2020 — 5

Daily Arts Writer Emily Yang delves into her 
winter break reads in five capsule reviews.

*** 

n+1, issue 35 
This is the only literary magazine I subscribe 
to in print, in part because it’s relatively 
inexpensive and in part because the writing 
it publishes tends to be both sophisticated and 
politically astute. It’s slightly under the radar, 
but occasionally individual pieces get wider 
attention. The piece that generated the most 
buzz from this issue is Tony Tulathimmute’s 
short story “The Feminist,” which was hailed 
as a spiritual successor to Kristen Roupenian’s 
late-2017 story “Cat Person” on at least one lit-
blog. It’s a detailed psychological portrait of a 
self-professed male feminist. If you’ve been 
on the Internet for the past few years you can 
probably guess where that goes. This story is 
particularly protracted — he stays a virgin into 
his thirties; his resentment metabolizes into 
violence. The Roupenian story this reminded 
me of isn’t “Cat Person,” but “The Good Guy.” 
They both employ a close third person, narrate 
most of their titular characters’ lives, are way 
too long, start to frustrate after a while in their 
oil-and-water mix of character study, polemic 
and satire.
Another story in this issue, “Parasite Air” 
by Trevor Shikhaze, has a similarly polemical 
aim, with more of a slant — a “discouraged 
worker” is paid by a billionaire to “offset his 
carbon” in a garish parody of consumer-choice 
environmentalism. The writing is crisp and 
witty, but the story is a bit of a nonstarter: as 
events become less causal, you can almost feel 
Shikhaze struggling to turn the one-liner of a 
premise into plot. 
Two pieces in the second half of the issue 
by Sarah Resnick and Alice Abraham operate 
in murkier ways. The former is an oblique, 
loosely sketched short story about a woman 
in New York dating two very different men, 
and the latter a personal essay about the 
author’s mother preparing to die of cancer. 
Both authors write incantatory, hypnotic 
prose — juxtaposition and inference running 
alongside logical progression and deduction. 
Resnick’s story is full of lists that read like 
annotated ship manifests or archival entries, 
unnamed or improbably named characters, 
actions seemingly with no motive and anxiety 
that silences. Its mood is the dense opacity of 
an unfamiliar city. Abraham is more willing to 
explain herself, but has a way of undermining 
herself: she wanders into discussions of her 
dreams and her romantic relationships, 
juxtaposes strange images, weaves between 
description and deduction as if one can be an 
answer for the other. She writes with an acute 
emotional intelligence and writes strangely 
in a way that recalls Didion. At one point she 
describes a date with her boyfriend with an 
image astonishing in its eerie lucidity: “We’re 
exposed, sensing ourselves — a hetero couple 
sitting across from each other — repeated in an 
unwavering pattern across the floor plan.” 

Jeffrey Eugenides, “The Virgin Suicides” 
I felt icky after I put this novel down, as 
I think is right: Eugenides unapologetically 
seeks out beauty in cloistered female pain, 
turns voyeurism into a literary genre. This 
is, before it’s anything else, creepy. What’s 
interesting about this is that a true literary 
voyeurism is only partly sexual, or at least lives 
in a kind of uncanny valley between sexual 
and nonsexual curiosity about a group of 
people. Curiosity about other people, and their 
ultimate unknowability in the face of inquiry, 
is a common topic for literary fiction — the 
obsessive passion the boys have for the Lisbon 
girls is, therefore, generalizable to themes 
common to literature as a whole. 
The novel’s position in the history of both 
the U.S. and of literature might have informed 
the methods that Eugenides uses to represent 
voyeurism — bureaucratic, itemizing, both 
invasive and antiseptic. The boys that form 
the hivemind narrator catalog and number 
their “exhibits” about the girls, photographs 
and potholders and bed springs and the girls’ 
fingerprints on the grimy windows forming 
detached fragments of a furtive kind of 
knowledge. We get something resembling a 
police file, a fossilized outline that is repeatedly 
lamented for its ultimate inadequacy. I’m 
reminded of the critic Mara Smith’s diagnosis, 
after James Wood, that the defining trait of 
fin-de-millénaire Anglo-American literature 
is its “surfeit of undigested information”: 
its appropriative excesses. The difference 
between this novel and those by writers 
like David Foster Wallace, Salman Rushdie 
and Zadie Smith is that for Eugenides, this 
avalanche of information isn’t employed for 
texture or affect, but as a futile attempt to find 
real meaning. There’s a reason all of these lists 
are there, if only to index their own uselessness. 

Hiroko Oyamada trans. David Boyd, “The 
Factory”
Oyamada based her first novel on her 
experiences temping at a subsidiary of Toyota. 
Temp work is usually pretty menial, filling 
in the gaps of what’s necessary in an office 
environment; usually the work temps do 
has little relationship to the real goals of the 
organization. Oyamada’s characters at the 
titular Factory (never mentioned by any other 
name) do work like this — one shreds paper 
all day, another proofreads opaque internal 
documents, the third works on an unsupervised 
project cataloguing moss. They occasionally 
have doubts about their jobs, but invariably 
remind themselves of how precarious the labor 
market is, how lucky they are to be employed at 
all. It’s less bleak than it sounds — Oyamada’s 
style is transparent and airy, rendering the 
increasingly mysterious factory in small details, 
from the smell of soap from a laundry facility to 
the small annoyances of office politics. After 
a while, you start to notice that surface detail 
substitutes for character development — she 
doesn’t really divulge characters’ backstories 
besides what you could get from a resumé, 
and instead devotes endless passages to the 
inscrutable, fine-grained details of the Factory, 
its rhythms and protocols, sometimes going as 
far as to resemble a piece of technical writing. 
It’s Oyamada’s impersonality that makes the 
novel such a strong, unnerving statement — we 

start to see her characters not as individuals 
but as representations of replaceable workers 
within a system too large to even understand, 
let alone escape. 

Robert Walser trans. and ed. Susan Bernofsky, 
“Berlin Stories”
NYRB’s collections of short fiction as “___ 
Stories” tracks with the place-focused trend 
in 21st-century fiction and thus packages 
a kind of reading into an edited collection. 
Usually, I would disapprove of this, but for a 
writer like Walser, it makes sense: most of the 
pieces collected in this book were published 
in the feuilleton (art criticism) sections of 
newspapers and were thus intended to be 
some kind of document of life in the city in 
the first person. The result is a hybrid style 
that could be read as a distant predecessor to 
autofiction, with a lot of room for reportage as 
well as for fictionalization and embellishment. 
Accordingly, his narrators are both rather 
transparent and totally involved in goings-on: 
restaurants, train cars, holidays, artistic society, 
the theater. The writing can be needlessly 
saccharine at times, but it’s possible to catch an 
inkling of what Walser is really capable of when 
he writes about the complicated and slightly 
tragic figure of his landlady or about the small 
drama of his own writing process. His defining 
quality is an admirably small voice: he gives the 
impression of someone who sees everything 
but lays claim to very little. 

Jeffrey Eugenides, “The Marriage Plot” 
A novel that attempts to center marriage any 
time after about 1960 is swimming upstream — 
as the jacket copy says, “the realities of feminism, 
sexual freedom, prenups, and divorce” make 
marriage a thing that isn’t as final as it was 
in the past. This is, to be clear, a good thing; 
however, if you were, hypothetically, a novelist 
still curious about applying the 19th-century 
aesthetic to any decade in the second half of the 
20th century, the reactionary 1980s is probably 
your safest bet. For Eugenides’ recent college 
graduates in limbo between childhood and 
PhDs, radicalism and retrenchment are both in 
the air. The Reagan era is a wonderfully tense 
moment to be intelligent and heterosexual. 
Neoliberalism isn’t the same thing as 
aristocracy, though, and Eugenides is missing 
the tightly-knit milieu that can be effectively 
energized by a marriage plot of the Victorian 
or Regency variety. This might be why this 
novel lacks a certain structural integrity: in 
a nineteenth-century novel, different parties 
having a stake in the success of different 
suitors means that romantic conflict becomes 
social and often material. There’s endless 
intrigue around marriage in a novel by Austen 
or Wharton only because marriage is never 
just marriage in this world. This might be why 
long sections of this 400-page novel sort of 
stall out into pointless backstory and limpid 
indecision. It’s fortunate, then, that Eugenides 
does backstory and indecision quite well; 
the digression of the novel ends up being its 
strongest feature. In the end, the answer to the 
question the novel seems to pose ends up being 
“no, but…”.

Revisiting what I read over break

BOOKS NOTEBOOK

Over the past month, as I 
boarded four flights and about ten 
bus rides, I found myself listening 
to the same recording over and 
over: 
Yannick 
Nézet-Séguin’s 
2012 recording of Mozart’s “Don 
Giovanni” 
with 
the 
Mahler 
Chamber Orchestra.
I’d set out to study the opera 
over the holiday break because 
I plan on referencing it in an 
upcoming project. “Don Giovanni” 
is a seminal work in the opera 
repertoire — some consider it to be 
the best opera ever written.

Given the meaning of this 
work, I figured the best way that 
I could go about studying it was 
pouring over the score. For those 
unfamiliar with opera, the score 
is the music notation from which 
all sound is derived. It contains the 
instrumental parts and vocal parts 
along with lyrics and some stage 
directions.
Studying 
a 
score 
requires 
patience. Rather than idly listening 
to a recording, it requires the 
viewer to read, comprehend and 
imagine each part on the page. 
It also requires the listener to 
imagine how these parts might 
fit together were they not slowly 
being read and understood from 
visual notation.
This is a skill I’ve worked on 
for years. It was something I 
struggled with as a high school 
composer and something I slowly 
but steadily improved over the past 
two years of undergraduate music 
theory. It’s something I am proud 
to have developed a fluency in, and 
something I like to exercise when 
possible.

Though I hadn’t wanted to 
admit it, I imagine a small part of 
me wanted to revel in the fact that 
I could study score. Not everyone 
is capable of doing that, I realize, 
and there’s a certain amount of 
superiority that one inherently 
feels over the layperson (or even 
average opera fan) in possessing 
this skill.
After a while, though, this study 
began to lose its interest. I began to 
wonder why I’d decided to study 
the work to begin with — the notes 
on the page stopped translating to 
sound in my head.
I decided to put the score aside 
and focused instead on a recording. 
I listened to it constantly, starting 
from the beginning of the opera 
and the beginning of each act. 
I followed along with the score 
and the libretto as I listened. I 
memorized the intricacies of every 
aria and the many false cadences of 
the overture.
And after my first listen, I knew 
my feeling of superiority at only 
needing a score to understand 
the work had been misguided. 
If 
the 
score 
represents 
the 
creator’s ideas of the work, the 
recording represents the creator 
and performer’s many additive 
creative thoughts about the work. 
If the score is what the composer 
intended, the recording is what the 
composer intended plus what the 

performers added.
This dichotomy is unique to 
the performing arts, that the 
creator’s idealized creation of the 
work rarely represents the final 
rendering of it. Is “Don Giovanni” 
best represented by its score, I 
asked myself, or by its recording? 
Does the work exist in the 
composer’s hand on paper or does 
it exist in the soundwaves captured 
by a computer — soundwaves 
bound for endless reproduction?
And after I returned from my 
trip I became aware of another 
complicated 
aspect 
to 
this 
equation. 
“Don 
Giovanni” 
as 
Mozart expressed it exists both 
in the notated score and in the 
computerized recording. But “Don 
Giovanni” as most opera houses 
present it is so much more than 
that.
The set design of specific 
productions, for example, can 
totally 
taint 
the 
audience’s 
understanding of the work. The 
costume design as well can make 
or break a production. And this 
is to say nothing of the staging 
and acting that goes into each 
production of the opera; the 
decisions that give each part in the 
score a physical presence.
If I wanted to study “Don 
Giovanni,” or even experience 
“Don Giovanni,” merely studying 
the score or listening to a recording 
would not be enough. I needed 
to experience the work from the 
audience. (Assuming I couldn’t do 
that, I needed to experience it via 
video.)
As such, I decided to watch one 
of the Metropolitan Opera’s online 
recordings of “Don Giovanni.” But 
the interpretative decisions made 
by the performers in this recording 
differed greatly from those made by 
the performers in Nézet-Séguin’s 
recording. And both interpretive 
decisions differed from those that 
I’d reached while studying through 
the score myself.
There’s a certain beauty, I 
realized, in the complexity of the 
performing arts. It’s every creative 
member of the production adding 
their 
own 
interpretation 
and 
insight to each manifestation of 
the work. It’s the creator providing 
not a definitive blueprint for 
the artistic work but a loose set 
of guidelines within which the 
performer can thrive.
And there’s also a certain beauty 
to be found in the temporality of 
this work, the uniqueness that 
every performance and every 
computerized 
reproduction 
provides. These products are all 
“Don Giovanni.” But they are also 
all discrete, distinctive works. 
One 
is 
Nézet-Séguin’s 
understanding of the work, the 
other the Metropolitan Opera’s, 

another merely the notes as they 
existed in Mozart’s head and 
on the notated page. There is no 
empirical, definitive manifestation 
of a work of the performing arts, 
I’ve realized. This exists neither 
in theory nor in practice. There 
are merely various interpretations, 
each 
with 
their 
respective 
strengths and faults. 
There is, I’ve come to realize, 
no single artistic work that is “Don 
Giovanni” — and far as I can see, 
there won’t ever be. But by the 
same token, why should there be?

French class with Françoise Hardy

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

There’s a certain 
beauty, I realized, 
in the complexity 
of the performing 
arts. It’s every 
creative member 
of the production 
adding their own 
interpretation and 
insight to each 
manifestation of 
the work. 

If the score 
represents the 
creator’s ideas 
of the work, 
the recording 
represents the 
creator and 
performer’s many 
additive creative 
thoughts about the 
work. 

“Oui mais moi, je vais seule par les rues, l’âme 
en peine,” Françoise Hardy sang at the tender 
age of 19, “Yes but I, I walk the streets alone, 
the lost soul,” with a voice that, despite her 
age, carried the painful loneliness of a woman 
twice, three times her age. Her debut song 
“Tous les garçons et les filles,” (“All the boys 
and girls”) skyrocketed her to stardom in the 
early ’60s. A star at the forefront of French pop 
culture, Hardy quickly cemented her status as 
an enduring French icon. 
While her prolific career spans decades, it 
is her first album, Françoise Hardy, released in 
1962, that I can’t help but return to as we enter a 
new year. At 19 years old, unsure of my direction 
or purpose, struggling to lay claim to family 
roots that I feel undeserving of, I take comfort 
in Hardy’s songs. In a sense, I see myself in the 
coquettish, knowing gaze on Hardy’s album 
cover. There’s a subtle, undeniable reassurance 
in Hardy’s songs. As she sings of memories, 
desires, grief beyond her age, my own self-doubt 
seems less foreign. 
Being as soul-searching and melodramatic 
as I am, however, is by no means a prerequisite 
to enjoy Hardy’s music. While an undeniably 
aged quality runs like a current beneath her 
flowing lyrics, she was a young girl, too. Playful 
flirtation, romantic daydreams and bright, 
animated singing are also trademarks of 
Hardy’s style. Her rise to fame came on the crest 
of the 60s Yé-yé wave, dominated by young 
female pop singers with playful songs, often 
featuring risqué innuendoes and suggestive 
undertones. Hardy eventually grew beyond the 
pop wave, but her earlier music, especially her 
1962 album, captures the mischievous, tongue-
in-cheek style of the Yé-yé fad.
I stumbled upon Hardy in an attempt to 
achieve the impossible: to master the French 
accent. In part, my ambition was born from 

stubbornness. When someone tells me I can’t 
do something, my knee-jerk reaction is to do it 
anyway. It’s why I spent a year learning Korean, 
why I spent hours locked away practicing scales 
and classical excerpts, why I own a Lebanese 
cookbook and why I wear my hair short, curly 
and ferocious. 
French, however, was a brutal foe. After 
weeks, months, years of garbled vowels and 
choked “r’s,” I decided my saving grace would 
have to be a return to the basics. After all, how 
does a child learn to speak? By listening. It was 
in the depths of Spotify that I stumbled across 
Françoise Hardy. A giant in her own right, but 
unfairly hidden in the digital stacks of Spotify.
I learned French alongside Hardy. Dancing 
in my kitchen to the bounce of Hardy’s playful 
“Oh oh chéri,” or rainy days spent to the 
lonesome heartbreak of “J’ai jeté mon cœur,” 
to listen to Hardy is to feel all at once young 
and ancient, experienced and naive, French or 
simply a woman of the world. A tad dramatic? 
Maybe. But the French have always had a 
flair for show-biz, and my own French roots 
resurface from their sequestered slumber as I 
listen to the songs of that fateful debut album. 
Rolling into the new decade, it felt fitting to 
indulge in a bit of nostalgia and take a return 
to both musical and cultural roots. Hardy 

remains a steadfast, entertaining partner. A bit 
somber and a bit childish, Hardy’s music is a 
good reminder to strike a balance between the 
obligations and demands of the coming years, 
and the joy of being young –– in spirit and in 
heart, not just inexperience and frivolity. Time 
and time again I find myself returning to my 
“Paris, France” playlist, filled with Hardy’s 
voice and ethos (lots of Yé-yé). Hardy’s allure, 
for me at least, is more than just a baseline of 
good music, or the celebration of adolescence. 
At the end of the day, it is simply refreshing 
to hear a voice that echoes my own life and 
experiences so well. A song-bird that reflects the 
turbulence of my own youth and naivety, and 
the (sometimes) stifling maturity required to 
try to figure out your entire life out at nineteen. 
I, too, hope for “Le jour où je n’aurai plus du 
tout l’âme en peine / Le jour où moi aussi j’aurai 
quelqu’un qui m’aime,” “The day that I will no 
longer be a lost soul/ The day that I, too, will get 
someone who loves me.” Maybe Hardy will be 
able to help me arrive at this fateful day sooner 
rather than later –– for now, I’ll be content with 
a familiar voice ringing in my ears, translation 
unnecessary.

The Voices Valiant Choir is 
famous for their heartwarming 
and 
welcoming 
concerts. 
Young or old, everyone enjoys 
exciting music and audience 
participation. But the special 
part is no one feels old when 
they’re listening. As the well-
known American Choir Teacher 

Helen Kemp proclaims and the 
choir echoes, “You don’t stop 
singing because you get old; 
you get old because you stop 
singing.”
Voices 
Valiant 
performed 
their Fall semester concert on 
December 14th at 11am in the 
STAMPS 
Auditorium. 
They 
are getting ready for the new 
semester by welcoming new 
members and beginning new 
music.
The group was started by 
Jerry Blackstone eight years 
ago and is now run by Norma 
Freeman. Their audiences and 
members benefit greatly from 
the choir’s work.
“There is tons of research out 
there that says one of the most 

valuable things that seniors can 
do is to sing,” Freeman said. “It’s 
such a hard one to multitask, 
because you have to sing the 
right note. You have to sing it 
for the right length of time. You 
have to sing it with words, and 
sometimes the words are not 
English words, and then you 
have to sound like the person 
next to you. So just that from a 
mental aspect is looking over 
how your brain is firing on all 
cylinders that way.”
Even 
the 
physicality 
of 
singing is beneficial to the 
seniors in the choir, according 
to Freeman. 
“And 
then 
physically, 
we 
work, but we do this in a gentle 
way. But you know, older people, 
we all tend to bend over, right?” 
Freeman said. “But to sing and 
to be able to sing with beauty 
in your voice takes a lot of 
breathing 
technique, 
getting 
those shoulders back, standing 
up straight and keeping your 
head up. And you know, we just 
think, ‘Why don’t we walk like 
this all the time?’”
Not only does choir singing 
have many physical and mental 
benefits, but many have found 
a home in this particular choir. 
Mary Koi has moved around 
her whole life and sang in every 
place she lived. When she moved 
to Michigan from Dallas, she 
knew she had to find somewhere 
to continue her singing. She 
found Voices Valiant in 2016 and 
has been a part of the group ever 
since.
“You never feel a sense of 
competition between the people 
in the group,” Koi said. “It’s 
just a really, really friendly, 
welcoming, great place.”
Freeman feels this connection 
to her choir as well. “There’s just 
not a better feeling than loving 
to sing and having people on all 
sides of you that love to sing,” 
Freeman said. “It just gives you 
an immediate community and a 
community where you feel that 
you’re getting something, but 
you’re giving too.”
With 
the 
new 
semester 
beginning, the choir of seniors 
aged 50 and above with any 
friends who want to join them 
is excited for new music and 
new friends. Their next concert 
will be toward the end of the 
semester and is sure to be a blast.

“I’ve yet to see anyone leave 
the concert who didn’t have 
a smile on their face,” says 
Freeman. “That’s what we’re all 
about!”

COMMUNITY CULTURE

The insightful music of ‘Hustlers’

FILM NOTEBOOK

ASIF BECHER
Daily Arts Writer

“Hustlers” 
isn’t 
just 
a 
story 
about 
ex-strippers performing a series of heists 
aimed at the Wall Street con-men who 
tanked the economy. It’s also not just the 
best movie of 2019 (though to this writer, 
it is most certainly that). “Hustlers” is a 
time capsule. It conjures magic through the 
story it tells in that specific way only cinema 
can — by plunging the viewer directly into 
the characters’ world. Its set design and 
costuming give the movie a distinct texture, 
evoking a highly specific place and time 
— in this case, New York City during the 
financial crash of 2008. Everything from 
the bedazzled “Bebe” T-shirts to the Juicy 
Couture sweatsuits, to the tanning beds, to 
the massive handbags, evokes an early aughts 
culture of fast fashion and glitz. “Hustlers” is 
a glittery movie, start to finish, but it doesn’t 
sparkle like a diamond — it sparkles like a 
rhinestone. 
The excess and the kitsch is the point, 
and the film is a masterclass in how to build 
a sensory world for the characters (and by 
extension, the viewers) to inhabit. Brilliant 
performances and an electric script by 
director Lorene Scafaria (“The Meddler”) 
fill that world, but a significant piece of the 
film’s power is derived from how real it feels. 
Nothing is more evocative, however, than the 
music of “Hustlers.” My theory is this: If you 
listen to the soundtrack start to finish with an 
ear for context and history, you’ll be treated to 
a complete economic history of the late 2000s 
in the United States. I can’t think of any film 
that uses music better or more intelligently 
than “Hustlers” — not just in recent memory, 
but ever. 
“I guess I’m just a people person.”
The very first words we hear in “Hustlers” 
aren’t spoken by a character, they’re sung 
by Janet Jackson. She sings: “This is a story 
about control,” as strip club newcomer 
Destiny 
(Constance 
Wu, 
“Crazy 
Rich 
Asians”) peers at herself in the mirror before 
heading onstage. Within the first 10 seconds, 
we understand something fundamental 
not just about Destiny, but about the act of 
stripping itself and what it means to her. Later 
in the film, in voiceover, Destiny explains that 
when the high-flying financiers of Wall Street 
come to the club, it’s likely “... the most honest 
transaction he’s had all day.” Money changes 
hands, more clothes come off. Simple enough. 
But because this is a story about control, 
Destiny learns to manipulate that interaction 
to her advantage, to use her looks and her 
brains to control what men think of her. 
She learns these skills from Ramona 
(Jennifer Lopez, “Second Act”), a veteran 
stripper who’s introduced while dancing to 
Fiona Apple’s “Criminal.” Fiona sings, “It’s a 
sad, sad world / when a girl will break a boy 
just because she can,” as Ramona performs 
gravity-defying feats up and down the pole, 
and the stage floods with cash. “Criminal” 
was written in 1996 by Fiona Apple when she 
was 18, allegedly in just 45 minutes, when her 
management team said her album lacked a 
hit. They made a video featuring Fiona rolling 
in her underwear around a dirty apartment 
filled with sleeping, half-naked people, and 
the song was a smash. 
It’s 
fascinating 
the 
way 
“Hustlers” 
repurposes 
“Criminal,” 
a 
song 
about 
voyeurism and desire written by a teenage 
girl who was presented to the world to be 
ogled. It invites the viewer to see both the 
song and Ramona through a different plane 
on their respective prisms. The power of 
Jennifer Lopez’s physical performance and 
her obvious dominance over everybody 
looking at her in the scene teases out the 

wryness and the irony in the song. Lines 
like “I’ve got to cleanse myself of all these 
lies ‘til I’m good enough for him” become 
winking jokes, because how could Ramona, 
a person with a presence that fills the room, 
a person so in control, ever wonder if she’s 
good enough for the men tucking money into 
her underwear. It’s a laughable question. The 
song also brings out a seriousness to Ramona, 
a plea for redemption for the people she 
would go on to hurt. “Save me from these evil 
deeds before I get them done” indeed. 
“2007 was the fucking best.”
The first act of “Hustlers” takes us through 
Destiny’s rise to the top with breakneck 
speed. She learns quickly from Ramona, and 
makes good money. Each moment of success 
— Destiny’s first shopping spree, being 
invited to swanky parties, buying her dream 
car — is punctuated with a montage and an 
early 2000s club song. It’s a dizzying tour of 
the pop charts in 2007, with songs like Sean 
Kingston’s “Beautiful Girls,” and in easily the 
best cameo of the last decade, Usher’s “Love 
in this Club.” As the music plays, wads of 
money are zipped into knee high boots, credit 
cards are swiped, apartments are purchased 
and giant designer handbags are bought with 
massive stacks of singles. These songs aren’t 
chosen just for nostalgia’s sake, or even just 
to remind us that it’s 2007 on the movie’s 
timeline. It’s excess in its purest, giddiest 
form, but it’s excess rendered on two fronts. 
They spend money like they’d always have it, 
and the music matches that idea. Early 2000s 
club radio had an ease and a buoyancy to it, 
as though joy was a limitless currency. There 
was no darkness in 2007’s Top 40 because, 
as Destiny says, “For one last moment, 
everything was so glamorous and so cool.” 
There’s a scene in the film where Destiny 
and Ramona are sitting in a car in a Cadillac 
dealership, decked out in their new purchases 
— big gold hoops, fur coats, perfect makeup. 
Destiny decides she’ll buy the car, turns 
on the radio to celebrate and “Gimme 
More” by Britney Spears blasts through 
the speakers. The pair immediately starts 
dancing, and then we cut to a Wall Street 
trading floor, where panic ensues. Britney’s 
voice is robotic, almost post-human as she 
sings, “Gimme gimme more /gimme more / 
gimme gimme more” over footage of massive 
banks hemorrhaging cash. It’s the perfect 
culmination of the excess of the music and 
culture the movie showed us just a few 
moments before. 
“Gimme More” was released at a time when 
Britney Spears was sick of people touching 
her, sick of people judging her. So she threw 
away the premise that she was supposed to be 
respectable, threw away the idea that she was 
supposed to fit into any preconceived notions 
about what a young woman in the public eye 
should be. She shaved her head so people 
would stop looking at her and she altered 
her voice under layers of digital distortion to 
release one of the great pop statements of the 
21st century in the form of Blackout. It was 
the end of an era in music — dance songs that 

hit the charts were uncomplicated from here 
on out. There was an aggression to “Gimme 
More” that songs like “Beautiful Girls” just 
didn’t have, a darkness and danger to it. 
When Destiny and Ramona dance to “Gimme 
More” in the Cadillac, they’re intoxicated 
with the idea of wanting and getting more, 
maybe even seeing themselves in lines like, 
“Cameras are flashing / we’re dirty dancing / 
they keep watching.” But they fail to hear that 
“Gimme More” isn’t just a celebration — it’s 
also a warning. 
“Hands where we can see ‘em.”
If “Gimme More” was an inflection point 
in the pop charts turning them incrementally 
darker, “Royals” was the true sea change. 
Lorde’s 2013 debut wasn’t just a massive hit, it 
was also a key moment in defining the textures 
and fabrics of the pop music landscape for the 
rest of the decade. EDM drops and “hands in 
the air” hooks were out. Trap hi-hats and low, 
smoky vocals were in. The ease and lightness 
of early 2000s dance pop was a thing of the 
past. It’s not a coincidence, then, that “Royals” 
is used to mark the true end in “Hustlers” of 
the reign of Ramona and Destiny. The song 
starts playing in the film as Ramona walks 
down the street to take out cash at the local 
ATM, and by the time she turns around, she’s 
surrounded by police officers, ready to arrest 
her. All the women involved in the scheme 
are arrested one by one, and when the song 
ends, the bars of the holding cell slam shut. 
It’s clear it’s the definitive end of an era, not 
just for these women, but for a moment in pop 
culture as a whole. “That kind of luxe just ain’t 
for us,” Lorde sings right as the rhinestone 
sweatshirts and massive designer bags stop 
making sense in the world of “Hustlers.” 
When we see Ramona next, she’s working 
at Old Navy and wearing a flannel shirt. 
There are little details that tell us she’s still 
herself: Her nails are still perfectly pressed 
and glamorous, her makeup is flawless and 
her hair is still long and shiny. But she looks 
different, a little sadder and a little wiser. 
Destiny too, looks different. Her house in 2015 
is pristine and white and so are her clothes, 
but she has none of her old glamor. Her hair 
is chopped short and she wears cardigans 
instead of fur coats. Her house looks straight 
out of a Crate and Barrel catalogue. 
Their worlds have changed, not for better 
or for worse necessarily — “Hustlers” is far 
too complicated a movie to make those kind 
of value judgments — but their worlds are 
quieter now. Less flashy and less sparkly. 
Ramona and Destiny’s aspirations for a 
specific kind of wealth have been put through 
the wringer not only by the financial crisis, 
but also by a world and a culture that’s 
changing around them in real time. Their 
dream of living a life glittering with the 
crystals and diamonds Lorde sings about 
are dashed — reduced to nothing more than 
a fantasy. Sure, there were moments when 
they had everything they wanted, when 
everything was so glamorous and so cool. But 
for now, they’re not caught up in that old love 
affair. At least, until the next heist. 

The launch of Disney+ in Nov. 2019 
gave rise to original content such as the 
ultra-meta “High School Musical: The 
Musical: The Series” and the Kristen 
Bell-hosted reality show, “Encore!” At 
the platform’s disposal is the abundance 
of licenced content that Disney has 
racked up over the years. 
One of the ways streaming services 
attempt to lure you in is not just with 
exclusive flashy original series but also 
through content that has been around 
for decades. While Disney+ boasts their 
Marvel library and the animated classic 
“The Simpsons,” my mind has been 
wrapped around the agelessness and 
rewatchability that surrounds another 
animated show —“Phineas and Ferb” — 
a children’s show about the impossible 
adventures 
of 
two 
kids’ 
summer 
vacation.
Originally 
airing 
between 
2007 
and 2015, “Phineas and Ferb” was an 
animated show intended for kids, but 
came with an adult sensibility that also 
welcomed older viewers. The humor is 
not just slapstick but surprisingly clever, 
with recurring gags that have lasted 

since the first episode of the show. 
Like the fact that Ferb never talks, but 
when he does, it’s always an insightful 
sentence in a British accent. Or when 
someone asks Phineas “Aren’t you a little 
young to be doing [insert activity]?” 
and he replies: “Yes. Yes I am,” then 
continues to build whatever it was that 
he’s too young to be doing. 
Every single episode boats sarcasm, 
weird scenes with floating baby heads 
and fantastic subplots involving Phineas 
and Ferb’s older sister, Candance, in 
her attempt to “bust” her siblings. Even 
as she tries to report them, Candace 
is aware of how the crazy thing her 
brothers are doing will be over as soon 
as she brings her mom to the backyard. 
She’s aware of the unwritten canonical 
rule that Phineas and Ferb will always 
get off the hook. We can relate to her 
frustration when her mom tells her 
to cool it. Though somewhat of an 
antagonist, even Candace was able to 
have dimension — her obsession with 
her boyfriend Jeremy transforms her 
from cold-hearted to a bundle of joy, 
perfectly capturing how all of us once 
acted around an early-teenage crush.
Then there’s the B-plot that surrounds 
their pet platypus, Perry, who doubles 
as the secret Agent P who fights the 
evil plots of Dr. Doofensmirtz, who 

encapsulates what it means to be an 
adult. He’s the villain who tries to take 
over the world — in this instance just the 
Tri-state area — but is always stopped by 
the good guys. 
Additionally, every episode features 
a catchy song that is never more than 
90 seconds. I’m not just talking about 
“Gitchy Gitchy Goo” but the actual gems 
like “You Snuck Your Way Right Into 
My Heart” and “S.I.M.P” and “There’s 
A Platypus Controlling Me.” Not to 
mention the fact that everyone from my 
generation knows the plastic tip at the 
end of the shoelace is called an aglet 
because Phineas and Ferb wrote a song 
about it.
The optimism and curiosity that 
surrounded Phineas and Ferb’s daily 
projects 
and 
Dr. 
Doofensmirtz’s 
failed “-inators” are enough to keep 
us endlessly entertained despite the 
inevitable same result. Phineas’s line 
“I know what we’re going to do today!” 
reflects the inspiration, spirit and joy 
that drives the entire show. There is 
truly no other show like it, which at least 
partly explains why people still watch it 
today. The title sequence told us to “stick 
with us cause Phineas and Ferb are 
gonna do it all,” and they did just about 
everything they could.

Inclusivity and 
the Voices Valiant

Haarms could pose problems for ‘M’

There are few big men in the 
Big Ten — and possibly even the 
country — that can match the 
physically-imposing 
frame 
of 
Michigan’s 7-foot-1, 265-lb, senior 
center Jon Teske. 
On more than one occasion so far 
this season, Teske has looked and 
played like a man amongst boys. 
While dominant performances 
against Appalachian State and 
UMass Lowell are to be expected, 
Teske also posted stellar statlines 
against the likes of Creighton, 
Gonzaga and Louisville. In short, 
Teske’s unique size has troubled 
some of the nation’s best teams 
— mainly because they lack an 
equivalent big man. 
Thursday night though, when 
9-6 Purdue travels to Crisler 
Center, Teske will square off 
with one of the conference’s few 
exceptions: 7-foot-3, 250-lb Matt 
Haarms. 
“This is nothing new with 
Purdue,” said Michigan coach 
Juwan Howard. “They’ve always 
had a guy that’s pretty similar in 
height. They’ve always had a guy 
who’s been an inside presence.”
While it is true that Haarms 
is just the latest Boilermaker big 
man to develop during head coach 
Matt Painter’s tenure, his skill 
set differs from past bruisers like 

JaJuan Johnson, A.J. Hammons, 
Caleb Swanigan and Isaac Haas. 
Haarms, who’s averaging 11.5 
points on 57.4-percent shooting, 
is a versatile offensive player — 
something Howard is aware of. 
“They use him both on the 
perimeter and in the low block,” 
Howard said. “I’ve seen him 
where he’s posting up a lot, I’ve 
seen actions where he’s ducked 
in on a high-low pass, I’ve seen a 
few pick-and-pop shots, I’ve seen 
when teams sag off on him and 
he’s able to make them pay from 
the outside. He’s a very skilled 
player for his size.”
Much like Teske has been for 
opposing teams this year, Haarms 
could be a matchup nightmare for 
the Wolverines. While Teske is 
strong enough to contest Haarms 
in the paint, asking him to defend 
Haarms’ jumper and three-point 
shot is a tall task. 
In moments where Teske’s on 
the bench, senior forward Austin 
Davis or sophomore forward 
Colin Castleton will likely draw 
the responsibility of guarding 
Haarms. Davis is a strong and 
industrious presence in the paint, 
but gives up five inches to Haarms 
and, like Teske, will struggle to 
guard Haarms’ perimeter shot. 
Castleton, on the other hand, is 
athletic enough to contest Haarms 
away from the basket but has yet to 
show the strength needed to keep 

opposing post players off the glass. 
Anyway 
you 
slice 
it, 
the 
Michigan defense will have its 
hands full with the Dutch big man. 
“We just have to be ready to take 
away some of those duck-ins and 
high-low passes and stuff like that, 
but it’s hard to do,” Howard said. 
“They’re very creative with their 
offense and the misdirections and 
surprising you with a few duck-ins 
here and there.”
Haarms’ shot-blocking ability 
on the other end is also important 
to note as he averages 2.3 blocks 
per game. 
While Haarms will undoubtedly 
be one of the tallest and most 
skilled bigs the Wolverines face in 
the Big Ten, this current Purdue 
squad has been wildly inconsistent 
offensively. 
The 
Boilermakers 
hung 69 points on Virginia’s 
tenacious defense and 83 against 
Minnesota just a week ago, while 
also scoring just 55, 56 and 37 
points in losses to Marquette, 
Nebraska and Illinois respectively. 
Meanwhile, Michigan has scored 
at least 70 points in all but three 
games this season. 
Haarms might manage to 
get his but if the Wolverines 
neutralize the rest of Purdue’s 
offense, even without leading 
scorer Isaiah Livers, who is still 
day-to-day with a groin injury, 
Michigan should get back on 
track with a win. 

After rough start, Jacob Hayhurst 
looking to make the most of chances

A moment stuck with Jacob 
Hayhurst from the day the 
Michigan hockey team lost to 
Michigan Tech in the Great Lakes 
Invitational finals.
The moment he missed ate 
the graduate transfer up in the 
proceeding days. Even five days 
after, he still found himself worked 
up at the thought of it.
He had dreamed of the opposite 
outcome, of burying the puck 
into the back of the net to give 
Michigan a chance to win the 
tournament, a chance to lift the 
first-place trophy and a chance to 
start the second half of the season 
with two much-needed wins.
Instead, in the final minute of 
play, Hayhurst hit the post twice, 
ultimately unable to convert his 
chances. He couldn’t score the 
game-tying goal, and when the 
Wolverine captains lifted the 
runner-up trophy, there were no 
smiling faces.
Everyone 
was 
upset, 
but 
Hayhurst most of all.
“I was pretty upset about it, 
because it would have been a 
fantastic victory for a team,” 
Hayhurst said. “And ultimately, 
the opportunity was on my stick at 
that moment. And I didn’t do what 
needed to be done.” 
He hadn’t just wasted two 
golden opportunities in crunch 
time. All throughout the game, he 
was given chances, put in spots 
others on the team would have 
loved. 
“He had one in the first period, 
wide open in the slot all by 
himself, stone cold, 20 feet out,” 
said Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“Buried it right in (the goalie’s) 
chest.”
It was emblematic of his scoring 
struggles all season long. 
When then-sophomore forward 
Josh Norris left Michigan to sign 
with the Ottawa Senators, Pearson 
desperately looked around for 
ways to fill the gaping hole left by 

Norris’s departure. High school 
commits weren’t an option. Most 
of them commit years in advance, 
leaving few viable options left for 
Pearson to probe. But Hayhurst 
was available and immediately 
eligible as a graduate transfer.
His skillset in particular stuck 
out to Pearson and the coaching 
staff, and they brought him in. But 
his lackluster showing thus far 
has netted a mere five points in 20 
games.
“I don’t mind saying he’s had, 
I think, a disappointing first half 
as far as his offensive production 
of play goes,” Pearson said. “We 
probably expected more from 
him and ... I’ve given him the 
opportunity and ice time that he’s 
received and the players he’s been 
able to play with. 
“And 
I’ll 
tell 
you 
it’s 
disappointing, and I’m sure he 
would say the same thing.” 
High expectations were set for 
Hayhurst from the start, when 
the coaching staff pitched him on 
the top line with senior forwards 
Jake Slaker and Will Lockwood, 
the returning two highest scorers 
from the year before. He was given 
top-line minutes, but the top-line 
offense failed to click, and he was 
a large reason why. 
So Pearson shifted him around, 
trying to find the right fit. He 

was tested on all four lines, given 
a variety of minutes, but he still 
wasn’t able to produce.
But 
being 
paired 
with 
sophomore forwards Garret Van 
Wyhe and Nolan Moyle offered 
a glimpse of what Hayhurst is 
capable of doing.
“I think as it came to the 
Christmas break, you could see 
that as a line, and as an individual, 
that my game kind of just was 
on an uprising,” Hayhurst said. 
“It was going up. And then even 
coming back from Christmas 
break, I think the line I’ve been 
playing with, Garrett Van Wyhe, 
Nolan Moyle, and myself. I think 
we’ve created a lot of chances 
together, and I think it’s just a 
matter of time before they start 
going in for us.”
It’s the fit Pearson hoped 
Hayhurst will find, and he thinks 
success will follow.
“The silver lining of all of this is 
there’s a lot there,” Pearson said. 
“So hopefully he can get it together 
and have a real strong second half 
and we need him.”
Hayhurst doesn’t want to hear 
the sound of the post, the clank 
that sends him hoping it would 
go post-to-net. He wants to turn 
things around and score goals, so 
that moments like the GLI won’t 
haunt him anymore.

3-point shooting central to success

Sometimes, the shots just 
aren’t 
falling. 
Many 
teams 
can withstand rough spells if 
they’re at an easier point in 
the schedule or have favorable 
matchups, but the Michigan 
women’s basketball team was 
not that lucky. 
In 
their 
two 
December 
losses against No. 8 Florida 
State and No. 12 Maryland, 
the Wolverines put up two of 
their worst 3-point shooting 
performances of the season, 
going 3-for-17 and 1-for-12 from 
beyond the arc, respectively. 
And with matchups against 
rivals Michigan State and Ohio 
State — as well as a rematch 
against the Terrapins — not far 
away, Michigan needed to find 
its shooting rhythm again. 
Following the first Maryland 
game, Penn State provided that 
opportunity. The Nittany Lions 
allow 70.1 points per game — 
tied for 80th in the country 
— and their opponents shoot 
a combined 34.1 percent from 
three, tied for 275th in the 
country. 
The 
Wolverines 
seized 
the 
opportunity, 
shooting 

8-for-19 
on 
3-pointers 
in 
an 82-48 victory over Penn 
State. Perhaps most crucially, 
junior forward Hailey Brown 
shot 3-for-6, after shooting a 
combined 1-for-11 the previous 
two games. 
“I think it’s more of a 
confidence thing,” Brown said. 
“At the end of the day I feel like 
I had to get more reps up before 
practice and after practice. It 
was up to me. So I think I came 
into (the Penn State game) 
confident in the work I’ve 
been doing since the Maryland 
game.”
That 
confidence 
made 
a 
major difference against the 
Spartans on Sunday, in a game 
where Michigan needed to 
score well to win. Michigan 
State scored a respectable 69 
points on 45.6 percent shooting, 
but it was no match for the 
Wolverines’ 89-point spectacle. 
Yet again, Brown was right in 
the middle of it, shooting 3-for-
5 from beyond the arc in the 
win.
But the 3-point shooting 
didn’t 
end 
with 
Brown. 
Sophomore guard Amy Dilk, 
senior guard Akienreh Johnson 
and sophomore forward Emily 
Kiser each added a 3-pointer. 

This 
strong 
team 
shooting 
performance helped Michigan 
to space the floor, creating 
opportunities for Dilk and 
sophomore 
forward 
Naz 
Hillmon to attack the basket. 
“When 
we 
miss 
(key 
3-pointers), it’s a different kind 
of game,” said Michigan coach 
Kim Barnes Arico. “But (against 
Michigan State) we made them, 
and that’s something our team 
works on every day, is making 
those shots and having the 
confidence to take those shots 
in big games.”
Hitting threes against a poor 
defensive team like Penn State 
isn’t particularly impressive. 
One individual strong game 
against Michigan State doesn’t 
mean much, either. But the two 
consecutive solid performances 
— especially coming off a cold 
streak — are a good sign for the 
Wolverines moving forward. 
With the Jan. 12 rematch 
against 
Maryland 
looming 
after Thursday’s game against 
Ohio State, Michigan will need 
to stay in this offensive rhythm 
if it wants to pull off the upset 
at home. 
If not, it’s looking at another 
disappointing game against a 
top opponent.

Amy Dilk’s injection of confidence

Going 
into 
the 
season, 
sophomore 
guard 
Amy 
Dilk was hyped up. A year 
older, 
stronger 
and 
more 
experienced, she would take 
the reins of the offense, she 
would be the floor general. A 
dominant 
double-double 
to 
start the season over Western 
Michigan furthered the hype 
train.
And then, she struggled. 
Forcing passes where none 
dare enter, doing too much.
But 
throughout 
Sunday’s 
89-69 victory over Michigan 
State, Dilk was unstoppable.
Multiple times, Dilk brought 
the ball up the court, took 
half a second to diagnose the 
defense, then drove to the 
basket for an easy layup. In 
what’s becoming a common 
source of offense, she did the 
same against Penn State, and 
No. 12 Maryland before that.
Yet all three of those games 
came in the aftermath of her 
best game as a Wolverine 
against No. 8 Florida State on 
Dec. 22. Against the highest-
ranked team Michigan has 
played all year, Dilk went 
deep into the game without 
missing 
a 
shot 
— 
almost 
single-handedly keeping the 
Wolverines in it with a career-
high 26 points.
Her recent offensive potency 
is the manifestation of what 
her coaches and players knew 

she needed to be all along.
“I think for her to take those 
next steps in her development, 
similar to what we talked about 
with (sophomore forward) Naz 
(Hillmon), is she’s gotta be a 
more consistent shooter,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico at media day prior to the 
season. “She’s gotta be willing 
to take those shots and knock 
down 
those 
shots, and she 
has 
worked 
hard on that in 
the offseason.”
Senior 
forward Kayla 
Robbins added 
at 
the 
time: 
“Her 
scoring 
ability 
has 
really 
gone 
up, 
and 
she 
has been able to score the 
basketball. And her passing, 
of course. She was one of 
the leaders in the Big Ten in 
assists. I think that if she can 
be a double threat in terms of 
passing the ball and scoring 
the ball, she’s going to be really 
good this year.”
For a while, though, it wasn’t 
obvious if Dilk would realize 
her potential. She struggled 
early in the year with an eight-
turnover game against Akron 
and seven against Notre Dame 
in the Wolverines’ first loss of 
the season.
Dilk’s performances forced 
Barnes Arico to take her off the 
court after her first turnover 

of a game, giving her time to 
watch the game and dissect 
it from the outside before 
going back in. Even when her 
turnovers were kept under 
control, she struggled to score 
— averaging 5.6 points per 
game over a five-game streak 
in December.
Still, 
after 
every 
game, 
Barnes Arico kept repeating, “I 
feel like I have one of the best 
point guards in the country.”
Last season, Barnes Arico 
said it took Dilk a while to 
settle into the rhythm of the 
court. After all, starting as 
a freshman in a top college 
basketball 
conference 
isn’t 
easy.
This year, it took Dilk some 
time to settle down again.
“Sometimes as a point guard 
you need to figure out your 
team, you need to figure out 
yourself,” Barnes Arico said 
on Dec. 30 before beating Penn 
State. “You need to figure out 
who can catch what passes. 
You need to figure out your 
decision 
making, 
and 
that 
was a little bit 
of 
a 
process 
coming into this 
season.”
Now, in her 
second year, and 
fully 
literate 
in the offense, 
she’s turned into 
a monster for 
the Wolverines.
“She’s playing 
with a lot more 
confidence, I think,” Barnes 
Arico said. “She can flip the 
game. 
Whether 
that’s 
her 
scoring, 
her 
passing, 
her 
rebounding or her defense, 
she’s the total package. I’m 
happy that she’s playing with 
the confidence that she is 
because she’s impacting our 
team.
“She can beat anybody to the 
basket. She’s faced incredible 
defenders in the last couple of 
weeks and still has the ability 
to get to the rim when she 
wants to.”
Should 
Dilk 
remain 
confident, Michigan’s offense 
will be deadly, as the Spartans 
found out on Sunday.

8 — Thursday, January 9, 2020
michigandaily.com

The first phone call was from a former 
athlete to the coach she loved. 

 Elise Ray was at a crossroads. After 

finishing her career as a gymnast 

at Michigan, she’d performed 

for Cirque du Soleil for three 

years, then worked briefly as 

a trainer and broadcaster. 

Like many athletes 

whose careers had 
come to an end, Ray 
wasn’t sure what 
was next. So she 
called Bev Plocki, 
her college coach, 
and asked for 
advice.
 “I haven’t really 
found that thing 
that I love,” Ray 
told her.
 Plocki responded: 
“Elise, in my 

opinion, you were 

born to coach 
gymnastics.”
 It was the 
first of three 
phone calls 
that came to 
define Ray’s 

career.

 A decade after 

that first call of 
advice, the two 
women — at the 
helm of their 
own programs 
in Michigan and 
Washington — 
scheduled a meet 

against each other. 

It should have been 

perfect, a coach and her 

protege, reunited where it all 

began, this time as competitors. 

 Except, in a twist of irony, Ray — 

now known as Elise Ray-Statz 

after getting married in 

2017 — is pregnant and 

due in a few weeks. 

She wasn’t cleared to 

travel to Ann Arbor.
 But Plocki has 
no doubt that the 
Washington team 
she’ll be seeing 
Saturday, part 
of a tri-meet 
with Texas 
Woman’s, will 
have Ray-Statz’s 
fingerprints all 
over it.
 Elise Ray hadn’t 
been any average 
gymnast. 

She was a star. 
 She trained under legendary coach 
Kelli Hill, reached the elite level as 
a teen, then won a USA Gymnastics 
national championship at the age of 
18. Later that year, she went to the 
Olympics.
 The 2000 Olympics were in Sydney 
in September. Ray was selected as one 
of six gymnasts to represent the U.S, 
the team captain of what was supposed 
to be a follow-up to the “Magnificent 
Seven,” which four years earlier had 
become the first American team to win 
Olympic gold. There were heaps of 
expectations.
 Everything went wrong.
 Ray dislocated her shoulder during 
the competition. She competed through 
it, but wasn’t the same. Not only did 
the team fail to defend its gold, it came 
away without a single medal (at least 
until a decade later, when the team 
was awarded a bronze medal due to 
the retroactive disqualification of the 
Chinese team). 
 In the all-around final, officials 
accidentally set the vault two inches too 
low. After sitting both her vaults, Ray 
fell off the beam. Though she got a do-
over on the vault, the beam score stood, 
and she finished 13th.
 “It was a very heartbreaking 
experience in Sydney just because 
the expectations were really high for 
us and so many things went wrong 
on multiple layers, and so we just left 
there and came home feeling like a 
disappointment,” Ray-Statz said. “ ... 
And I just really felt like I wanted to be 
done with gymnastics because I was 
heartbroken.” 
 “I just was done.”
 But her career was just beginning. 
Only three months after getting back 
from Sydney, Ray joined the Wolverines 
as a freshman. Her first meet was less 
than two weeks later.
 The second phone call came from a 
coach in need.
 It was 2011, and Joanne Bowers had 
just done the hardest thing she’d ever 
had to do: She’d fired an assistant.
 Wanting someone to confide in, 
Bowers — at the time the head coach at 
Washington — turned to Plocki, with 
whom she had worked as an assistant 
coach at Michigan. Bowers told Plocki 
of the sudden opening on her staff and 
asked if Plocki knew anyone who might 
be interested.
 “As a matter of fact,” Plocki told her, 
“I don’t know if you can get her to come 
to the other side of the world in Seattle, 
but I know that Elise Ray is interested 
in potentially coaching collegiate 
gymnastics.”
 As a competitor, Ray had been a 
natural observer and frequently asked 
questions of her coaches. She knew 
how to lead a team, and her name came 
with built-in respect. Unlike many 
former elites, Ray had always been a 
team player, and that stood out from the 
beginning.
 Maybe, just maybe, Ray thought, this 
could be the next step she was looking 
for. 
 Bowers offered her the job, and in 
2011, Ray-Statz officially became a 
college coach.
 The first time she competed on vault 
as a Wolverine her freshman year in 
2001, Elise Ray did a Yurchenko layout.
 Here was the captain of the U.S. 
Olympic team, already a national 
champion, doing a vault with one-
and-a-half fewer twists than the 

one she’d done in Sydney just months 
earlier. People expected her to come 
flying out of the gate, so it was shocking 
when she kept it simple.
 But that was part of Michigan’s plan. 
Ray had been injured, and she was still 
hurting from her Olympic experience. 
Plocki wanted to afford her the space to 
heal, physically and mentally.
 “She’s been through a ton and we’re 
trying to give her some space and a little 
bit of down time and healing for this,” 
Plocki said. “There’s no need for us to 
go a thousand miles an hour out of the 
gate and I just kept telling her, trying to 
reassure her and people who would ask 
me, don’t you worry about that. When 
she needs to be ready at the end of the 
season, she will be ready.”
 Sure enough, that very season, Ray 
won an NCAA title in the all-around. 
 And the team environment provided 
Ray with the tools she needed to truly 
heal.
 In college gymnastics, rosters are 
bigger, so gymnasts only have to 
compete on their strong events. The 
lowest score on every event is dropped. 
And the best teams require high-level 
contributions from everyone. 
 Ray struggled to open up to her 
coaches and teammates about her 
experience in Sydney, but people could 
sense that something wasn’t right. 
So they helped convince her that this 
experience would be different.
 With Michigan, Ray wasn’t expected 
to be perfect. She wasn’t Elise Ray, 
Olympic Gymnast. She was just one of 
the Wolverines.
 “You are competing for your 
teammates, you’re competing for your 
university, and that’s a very different 
feeling than I ever had competing in 
gymnastics,” Ray-Statz said. “And it 
was incredible because you’re doing 
something beyond yourself, which is 
always more motivating.”
 Ray quickly gained respect among 
her teammates. She cheered on their 
successes as much as her own. If she 
believed Michigan could do something, 
everyone did. 
 Plocki likened Ray’s college journey 
to the stock market. There were always 
ups and downs. It wasn’t a straight 
upward trajectory; things like this never 
are. 
 But everyone noticed that the Ray 
who joined the Wolverines wasn’t the 
Ray who left them. 
 When she competed, Ray’s eyes began 
to sparkle and her face began to glow 
again. Little by little, Plocki watched as 
Ray regained her love for gymnastics 
and grew into the best gymnast the 
program had ever had.
 Ray set numerous Michigan 
records, winning 14 All-American 
honors and three individual national 
championships while leading the 
Wolverines to the Super Six finals three 
times. But the part that will always 
stick with her is the transformative 
environment her coaches created. 
Plocki and Sherman, too, say their 
greatest accomplishment with her 
wasn’t the titles she won, but the spark 
she found.
 Though she never questioned her 
decision to come to Michigan, Ray was 
ready to be done with the sport after 
the Olympics. At the conclusion of her 
Wolverines career, she wanted a way to 
stay involved.
 Michigan had given Ray a place where 
she could fail. A place where she could 
heal. A place that planted the seeds for 

the next stages of her life.
 In 2016, Bowers stepped down to be 
closer to family. Ray was offered the job. 
So she turned to Plocki, the woman who 
had helped her find love in gymnastics 
again, looking for guidance. That was 
the third phone call.
 “What do you think?” Ray asked.
 “What do you mean, what do I think?” 
Plocki responded. “There are so many 
people around the country that have put 
in years and years and years as assistant 
coaches that would die, a Division I, 
Pac-12 head coaching position is gonna 
fall into your lap and you’re calling me 
asking me, ‘What should I do?’ ”
 Ray had always been a homebody. She 
wanted a family and children, and she 
wasn’t sure how a head-coaching career 
would fit into that. But if there was 
anyone who knew how to juggle those 
considerations, it was Plocki, who’d 
successfully balanced coaching and 
family life for years.
 “The beauty of being a head coach, 
Elise, is that you have the ability to 
create, to build your staff in a way that 
works for you,” Plocki told her during 
the conversation.
 Plocki assured Ray that she could 
juggle family life with gymnastics. All 
she needed was to be upfront about her 
desire and hire assistants who could 
take some of the stress off, particularly 
in recruiting. So Ray took the job.
 Washington isn’t the easiest place to 
win in gymnastics. Ray-Statz’s Huskies 
have to compete with Pac-12 powers 
like UCLA, Stanford and Utah. But in 
her first season at the helm in 2017, Ray 
was named the Pac-12 Coach of the Year 
after leading Washington to nationals 
for the first time in 19 years, where 
it finished eighth — the second-best 
placing in program history. The next 
year, the Huskies followed that up with 
another record-breaking eighth-place 
finish, this time in the regular season, 
and won the floor championship at 
NCAA Regionals.
 Last year, Michigan’s coaches found 
out that an opponent they’d scheduled 
had pulled out of a meet. So they sent 
out an email to the coaching body, 
asking if anyone was interested in filling 
the empty date.
 Texas Woman’s was the first to 
respond. But when Ray-Statz and her 
staff got the email, they couldn’t let 
the opportunity pass. So the dual meet 
became a tri-meet, with the Huskies 
added in.
 No one knew when the meet was 
scheduled that Ray-Statz would 
be eight months pregnant and she 
wouldn’t be cleared to travel with the 
team.
 But maybe that’s a testament to 
everything Ray-Statz took from her 
former coach. Plocki showed Ray-Statz 
how to find a passion for gymnastics 
again. She served as a model for how 
to lead a program and how to foster 
gymnasts’ growth. And she told Ray-
Statz that coaching was something she 
was meant to do — and something she 
could make work.
 There’s something Ray-Statz likes 
to call “the Washington bubble.” 
When it’s time for a meet, the Huskies 
focus only on themselves. The other 
team doesn’t play into the equation. 
But Ray-Statz knows that during the 
meet on Saturday, she’ll be glued to 
social media. And for that day, she’ll 
closely follow not just her own team, 
but Michigan, the place where all this 
started.
