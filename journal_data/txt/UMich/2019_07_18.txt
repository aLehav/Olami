$200,000 project 
set to be completed 
by fall semester

At the center of the University 
of Michigan’s Ann Arbor campus, 
where the Diag’s two largest 
paths cross, lies a bronze block 
‘M’ set in granite in the ground. 
The monument was donated by 
the University’s class of 1953 as a 
gift to then University President 
Harlan Hatcher. During the fall 
and winter semesters, thousands 
upon thousands of students, staff 
and visitors pass the block ‘M’ 
every day, but few dare to tread 
on it directly.
“Campus legend has it that 
if you step on the M you will 
flunk your first blue book exam, 
hence the many people who 
diligently avoid trodding on the 
marker,” the University’s cultural 
attraction description says.
Students revere the ‘M’ as 
an icon of the University, so 
when construction began on 
the artifact in early July, they 
noticed. LSA sophomore Alexis 
Irlbeck said the construction 
is necessary, but joked it was 
alarming.

“For one, I would really hope 
that none of the construction 
workers 
were 
poor 
little 
University of Michigan students 
working for the summer and 
having to work that closely to 
the block ‘M,’” Irlbeck said. 
“Obviously, it’s a good thing. It’s 
going to look all nice and brand 
new, but it is kind of sad that it’s 
all covered up by construction 
right now. Hopefully, that is not 
going to be the case when all the 
freshmen come in September.”
The construction is being done 
by outside contractor J. S. Vig 
Construction and is scheduled 
to be complete by the time 
classes begin for the Fall 2019 
semester, according to University 
Spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald. 
Fitzgerald also told the Daily the 
project’s total cost is $200,000, 
half of which is being covered by 
donor funds.
The project entails replacing 
the concrete beneath the M as 
well as the stone surrounding 
it. In an email press release, 
the University said the selected 
stone was chosen to uphold the 
historical look of the landmark 
while enhancing its durability.
“The Giallo Veneziano stone 
material that will be installed 
matches the existing stone and 
the current shape and pattern 
will remain the same,” the release 
said. “The new stone panels will 

be considerably thicker and are 
expected to hold up much better 
to Michigan’s extensive freeze-
thaw cycles.”
Irlbeck works as a Campus 
Day Leader, showing prospective 
students around campus in the 
spring as an ambassador for 
the University. Irlbeck tells her 
groups about the block ‘M’ legend 
by gathering them in a circle 
around the marker like one would 
share a story by the campfire.
“What I just tell everybody 
is not to step on the block ‘M,’ 
but if you do, there is one way to 
reverse the curse,” Irlbeck said. 
“So, I’ll turn around and point at 
Hatcher.”
Irlbeck then explains to her 
groups the curse’s only anecdote 
is if the afflicted runs from the 
steps of the Hatcher Graduate 
Library to kiss the pumas on the 
Biological Sciences Building and 
run back. The sprint must also 
happen within the first and last 
tolls of the Bell Tower at midnight 
— which is both physically and 
logistically impossible because 
the Bell Tower no longer rings 
after 10 p.m. — and the runner 
must be naked, which is illegal.
Whenever she tells the story, 
Irlbeck said she feels like she’s 
“including” 
students 
in 
the 
University community.

Nonpartisian 
election plan 
fails by 1 vote

City Council votes 
down Mayor Chris 
Tylor’s proposal
at meeting

On 
Monday, 
Ann 
Arbor 
City 
Council discussed an override of 
Mayor Christopher Taylor’s veto of a 
resolution that would put an initiative 
on whether or not the city’s elections 
should be partisan on the November 
2019 election ballot. The council 
ultimately fell one vote short of the 
eight votes necessary to override the 
veto. 
Before the contentious vote, the 
council welcomed Michael Cox, the 
new Ann Arbor police chief. Cox said 
he looks forward to working for and 
with the community. 
“Thank 
you 
all 
for 
showing 
confidence in me to lead this great 
city and police department,” Cox said. 
“I can’t wait to work with both the 
citizens of Ann Arbor and the police 
officers here.”
During 
public 
comments, 
four 
people spoke about boycotting Israel. 
Multiple 
councilmembers 
shared 
their own views on the issue and 
how the Ann Arbor Human Rights 
Commission should handle it. 
Councilmember 
Ali 
Ramlawi, 
D-Ward 5, spoke about how the Ann 
Arbor Human Rights Commission 
should look at human rights issues 
across the world. Other members 
of the council, such as Julie Grand, 
D-Ward 3, and Zachary Ackerman, 
D-Ward 3, discussed how they feel 
Jewish identities and spaces are often 
attacked by protestors in Ann Arbor.
City Council then discussed the 
override of they mayor’s veto on a 
ballot initiative. Currently, Ann Arbor 
elections are partisan, and the ballot 
initiative resolution introduced on 
July 1 would allow voters to decide 
if Ann Arbor elections should be 
nonpartisan.

‘U’ school creates 
health podcast

School of Public 
Health looks to 
make research
more accessible

The University of Michigan 
School 
of 
Public 
Health 
released a new podcast titled 
“Population Healthy” to spread 
their work to the general public. 
Public Health doctoral student 
Nina Masters said public health 
work tends to only spread inside 
a small echo chamber, so the 
podcast acts as a medium for 
sharing knowledge.
“I think that these kinds of 
ideas have to be incorporated into 
STEM fields, especially public 
health, because the nature of it 
is so much about impacting the 
public and changing behavior 
and raising awareness,” she said. 
“It’s kind of weird that it’s not a 

mandatory part of the program, 
or at least something that people 
are trying to do. I just, kind 
of, hope that this can be part 
of initiatives by the School of 
Public Health and other schools 
to try to just increase students’ 
ability to find other ways to 
articulate their ideas.”
In the first season — which 
will run weekly through the end 
of August — will cover a range of 
topics from the opioid epidemic 
and gun safety, to aging and 
childhood nutrition. Each 20 to 
30-minute episode will feature 
three or four professionals who 
will showcase their different 
perspectives and expertise.
With over 200 students, 530 
faculty and staff and 16,000 
alumni, the School of Public 
Health studies topics ranging 
from epidemiology and health 
management, to biostatistics and 
environmental health sciences. 

More than 100 
demand rights for 
undocumented 
immigrants

On Saturday, more than one 
hundred 
community 
members 
gathered 
at 
the 
Washtenaw 
County Administration Building 
to urge Washtenaw County and 
the Michigan legislature to allow 
undocumented 
individuals 
to 
obtain driver’s licenses. Carrying 
signs and banging makeshift 
drums, 
participants 
marched 
through downtown Ann Arbor in 
a demonstration led by the Ann 
Arbor chapter of Movimiento 
Cosecha, a national nonviolent 
movement 
fighting 
for 
the 
protection 
of 
undocumented 
immigrants’ rights. 
Movimiento 
Cosecha 
Ann 
Arbor wrote they are demanding 
driver’s licenses for everyone as 
driving without licenses causes 
the 
immigrant 
community 
uncertainty and fear. Filling the 
streets with signs and banners 
while 
chanting 
“¿Cuando? 
!Ahora!” (When? Now!), Spanish 
and non-Spanish speakers alike 
walked in solidarity.
In 2008, a 2007 Attorney 
General opinion was implemented, 
denying 
licences 
to 
all 
undocumented people, including 
lawful noncitizens. Prior to this 

implementation, individuals only 
needed to prove their identity 
and Michigan residency when 
applying for a driver’s license.
Movimiento Cosecha organizer 
Sergio 
Hurtado 
explained 
driver’s licenses are important 
for undocumented immigrants to 
be able to drive out and perform 
the basic tasks such as running 
errands, taking their kids to 
school or going to work. Hurtado 
said the march had two purposes: 
to 
demand 
that 
Wasthenaw 
County pass a resolution in 
support of immigrants and to 
urge legislation be introduced in 
the state legislature that would 
give access to driver’s license to 
undocumented immigrants.
“We wanted the community to 
come out here and be united and 
show our presence, and show that 
in this political climate we are not 
afraid,” Hurtado said.
The 
demonstration 
comes 
during a period of heightened 
interest in the immigration system, 
with politicians touring facilities 
at 
the 
border. 
Immigration 
reform is also a main issue in the 
Democratic presidential primary, 
and has been a major talking point 
for President Trump.
Jose Alvarez, son of a member of 
Movimiento Cosecha, explained 
the impact of driver’s licenses 
from a youth standpoint. He said 
kids of undocumented immigrants 
are afraid, and he hopes that every 
time they go to the drug store, or 

Immigrant rights 
garner A2 support

‘U’ community reflects 
on rising tuition, fees

The 
University 
of 
Michigan Board of Regents 
approved a series of tuition 
and 
room-and-board 
increases at their June 20 
meeting. 
The 
headline 
of 
the 
University’s press release 
emphasizes the 1.9 percent 
in-state 
undergraduate 
tuition increase is the lowest 
in six years, with a lower-
division rate of $15,588, $296 
more than last year. Lower-
division refers to students 
who’ve completed 0 to 54 
credits towards their degree. 
In the same sentence, the 
release notes an 11.2 percent 
increase in the financial aid 
budget to offset the increases 
in tuition, bringing total 
funding allocated for need-
based aid to $228.6 million. 
This means most in-state 
students 
receiving 
need-
based aid will not pay more 
in tuition costs this coming 
year, the release explained. 
At 
the 
June 
Regents 
meeting, University Provost 
Martin Philbert provided 
data to show University 
tuition costs are the lowest or 
among the lowest compared 
to other public institutions 
for families making up to 
$110K.
University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
also 
emphasized his commitment 
to affordability, particularly 
for in-state students. 
“By investing in academic 
excellence 
and 
our 
commitment to affordability, 
we 
are 
ensuring 
that 
Michigan 
residents 
who 
need it most will see no 
increase in their tuition cost 
as they study at a world-class 
public research university,” 
Schlissel said. 
Out-of-state undergraduate 
tuition 
will 
increase 
by 
3.7 percent, an increase of 
$1850 to bring total tuition 
to $51,200. Graduate tuition 
is set to increase 3.2 percent, 
a $762 increase for in-state 
students and a $1526 increase 
for out-of-state students. 
There will also be a 

four percent increase for 
on-campus room-and-board 
rates, which the release 
said will go towards future 
renovations and preserving 
improvements in recently-
renovated 
buildings. 
According to the release, 
eight residence halls are in 
need of “major upgrades.”
Additionally, 
the 
University is introducing 
a $500 per term fee for 
international students on 
F and J type visas “to help 
cover the cost of sustaining 
and 
enhancing 
services 
to support this important 
student 
segment.” 
These 
include 
costs 
associated 
with regulation compliance, 
which the release said now 
requires more staff time and 
expertise as they become 
more complicated. 
“It will take some time 
to determine the specific 
ways in which the funding 
generated by the fee will be 
utilized,” the release said. 
Prior to this fee, there was 
no difference in tuition costs 
between out-of-state and 
international students. The 
fee will put the University 
“in alignment” with other 
universities with additional 
fees or greater tuition costs 
for international students, 
the press release stated.
In the press release, the 
University said it will cover 
the international student fee 
for Ph.D. students, graduate 
student 
instructors 
and 
graduate 
student 
staff 
assistants.
While presenting at the 
June 
meeting, 
Philbert 
explained tuition would be 
$6400 without endowment 
support. 
As 
of 
October 
2018, 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
has 
an 
endowment of $11.9 billion, 
“the ninth largest among 
U.S. universities and third 
among public universities 
after 
two 
university 
systems.” 
According 
to 
the University, about 22 
percent, or $2.5 billion, of 
the endowment is used for 
student scholarships and 
fellowships.

‘U’ free tuition 
program finds 
new company 

University of Texas 
Austin releases program 
similar to University’s 
Go Blue Guarantee

Last week, the University of Texas 
at Austin announced full tuition 
support for students from families 
making 
less 
than 
$65,000 
and 
guaranteed financial aid for students 
from families making up to $125,000 
who have financial need beginning 
in fall 2020. 
This new support will expand 
upon UT Austin’s Texas Advance 
Commitment, developed in 2018 
to cover the full price of tuition 
for students from families earning 
$30,000 or less and offer assured 
support for students from families 
earning up to $100,000. The new 
program will also make the Texas 
Advance Commitment available to 
transfer students. 
In UT Austin’s press release, UT 
Austin President Gregory L. Fenves 
thanked Kevin Eltife, Board of 
Regents chairman, for prioritizing 
students and investing in Texas’s 
future, calling college affordability 
one of the most critical issues 
affecting Texans. 
“Thanks to (Eltife’s) leadership 
and the board’s action, this new 
endowment will go a long way toward 
making our university affordable for 
talented Texas students from every 
background and region,” Fenves said. 
The expansion of UT Austin’s 
Texas Advance Commitment has 
drawn comparisons to the University 
of Michigan’s Go Blue Guarantee, 
implemented in 2018. Like the new 
Texas Advance Commitment, the 
Go Blue Guarantee promises to help 
pay the full price of tuition and fees 
for undergraduate students from 
families making less than $65,000. 
Both programs work by covering 
the remaining cost of tuition after 
factoring in the student’s other 
sources of tuition funding, grants 
and scholarships. 
In an email to The Daily, J.B. 
Bird, UT Austin Director of Media 
Relations and Newsroom, confirmed 
UT Austin looked at tuition support 
programs at institutions across the 
nation, including Michigan.

AKAASH TUMULURI | COLUMN
F

orget 
about 
reaching 
across the aisle. House 
Democrats 
are 
having 
trouble reaching across their 
own pews.
Pews that need to be unified 
now, more than ever. It’s pre-
election fever, the same as we’ve 
seen before — a tide that in 2016 
crested on the political fringes 
and brought us candidates like 
Trump and Bernie — making 
moderates 
wary 
with 
the 
specter of 2020 looming on 
the 
not-so-distant 
horizon. 
Speaker of the House Nancy 
Pelosi seems to be attempting 
her best Moses impersonation, 
trying to single-handedly quell 
the progressive wave of far-
leftists while claiming moral 
high ground based on her fight 
for unification that supposedly 
prioritizes 
the 
party, 
not 
necessarily progressivism. 
Supporters of “The Squad,” 
as Democratic Representatives 
Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez 
of New York, Ilhan Omar of 
Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of 
Michigan and Ayanna Pressley 
of Massachusetts are known, 
will find this a hard pill to 
swallow. Especially after the 
House’s support of a $4.6 billion 
border funding bill lacking many 
conditions of improvement for 
migrant families and children 
— 
sparking 
loud 
dissent 
from 
progressives 
that 
aim 
to “disrupt” Congress like a 
Silicon Valley startup. 
The headliners of this fight 
are, of course, AOC and Pelosi. 

They’ve traded jabs left and 
right, “trapped in a generational 
and ideological tangle” that 
threatens the strength of the 
Democratic party as a whole, 
according to Maureen Dowd of 
the New York Times. It’s gotten 
to the point where Ocasio-
Cortez, whose statements I 
would have stood by about a 
month ago, has accused Pelosi 
of “targeting women of color.” 
Pelosi, 
among 
many 
other 
things, helped our first African 
American president not only 
reach the highest office, but 
enact his agenda against an 
opposition hell-bent on seeing 
his name go down as a footnote 
in history. I’m sorry, AOC, I 
just can’t see it. I laud your 
attempt to try and shake up 
Congress, I do. It needs one, 
badly, but this doesn’t seem 
like the way to do it.
Especially because this is 
the first time in a while that 
the Democrats have completely 
taken control of the news cycle 
— but for all the wrong reasons.
The 
House 
Democrats’ 
Twitter 
account 
feuding 
with 
Ocasio-Cortez’s 
Chief 
of Staff, Saikat Chakrabarti. 
Mr. 
Chakrabarti 
comparing 
moderate 
Democrats 
to 
Southern Democrats in the 50’s. 
Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin 
calling the bipartisan Problem 
Solvers 
Caucus 
the 
“Child 
Abuse Caucus.” And again, the 
example of AOC and Pelosi’s 
very 
public 
admonitions 
of each other fits this bill. 

All 
these 
stories 
serve 
as 
nothing more than fuel for a 
Republican Party that seems 
content 
sitting 
back 
and 
watching the Democrats set 
fire to themselves right before 
the primaries roll around. 
But even framing it like 
that makes me uneasy. The 
Democrats have made strides. 
They took back the House in 
2018 — a win led by Pelosi, 
who focused on flipping red 

seats blue by placing emphasis 
on a moderate agenda. In her 
current role as speaker, she 
seemed adept at navigating 
the 
most 
discombobulated 
White House in history, able 
to simultaneously admonish 
the President for his numerous 
mistakes and secure his ear 
whenever necessary to reach 
across the aisle. “The Squad” 
and their allies, on the other 
hand, have ignited a liberal, 
progressive 
coalition 
that 
demands to be heard by the 
Democratic elite — believed to 
be helmed by Pelosi.

That’s where we find the 
fork in the road. It’s all about 
belief — and the lack thereof. 
Progressive Democrats don’t 
believe House leadership is 
doing enough to push back 
against conservative, Senate-
led policy. Pelosi and other 
moderates believe the youthful 
far-left isn’t being pragmatic 
and will lead the party down a 
frustrating road of government 
shutdowns 
and 
political 
stalemates. 
And, 
the 
worst 
part is, they’re both right. 
The new wave of freshmen 
representatives 
simply 
don’t 
yet have the political capital 
to whip votes necessary to 
enact their agenda. And the 
moderates 
that 
control 
the 
House fail at igniting the youth 
they so desperately need to take 
back the highest office. 
Despite all this, the speaker 
seems to be playing her cards 
close to her chest, and for what? 
AOC is a star, the darling-child 
with a 4.8-million-and-growing 
online following, the new face 
of a movement, undoubtedly 
an 
asset 
for 
a 
Democratic 
party lacking in emotionally-
charged 
constituency. 
They 
should be working together 
— the two women leading 
the Democratic Party into a 
unified, 
progressive 
future. 
The problem? Neither can see 
past each other’s differences 
to the wealth of similarity they 
share, because they both have 
precedent to stand by their 
beliefs. Bernie’s meteoric rise 

in the 2016 primaries validates 
AOC and her allies’ call for a 
more progressive agenda, and 
the 2018 midterms validates 
Pelosi’s slow-and-steady MO for 
change. 
So here we are again, stuck in 
a battle for the future of a party 
that seems to be returning to 
the same road, again and again, 
hoping for it to lead somewhere 
new each time. And it’s hard for 
me to blame anyone for it. 
So I’m sorry. I’m tired of 
seeing the same progressive 
versus moderate battle with 
sudden-death 
brutality; 
I’m 
tired of watching those I believe 
in become caught up in arbitrary 
and misguided climbs to the 
highest plane of morality; I’m 
tired of seeing the Democrats, 
again, focus on sweet nothings 
that 
are 
beside 
the 
point. 
Because the point is Trump will 
be reelected if the Democrats 
can’t 
find 
a 
way 
to 
stop 
bickering. If that happens, it 
would be as close to the death of 
the Democratic Party as we will 
have ever seen. You get the sense 
that the collective Democratic 
ego that made it a foregone 
conclusion Hillary would win 
in 2016 is rearing its ugly head 
once again. The irony of course 
being the lack of hindsight in 
2020. But numbingly, all I can 
say is this: Once again, we can’t 
do more than wait, see and 
hope. Mostly just hope.

ANNE ELSE | COLUMN

O

n July 5, as tempera-
tures rose and Ann 
Arborites flocked to 
the river to spend their day on 
the water, they were met with 
a disappointing development. 
A sanitary sewer main break 
occurred that morning causing 
sewage to enter a storm pipe 
and empty into the river. City 
officials managed to repair the 
pipe break relatively quickly, 
but there were still roughly 
3,000 gallons of raw sew-
age that managed to enter the 
water. This sewage leak could 
affect several species that live 
in the river, as well as summer 
activities.
This local destruction of 
waterways prompted me to 
think 
about 
how 
precious 
Michigan’s water really is. 
After years of enduring the 
Flint Water Crisis, some fami-
lies still do not have access 
to clean water. In 2019, there 
are still pipes sending lead 
tainted 
water 
to 
people’s 
homes, although the city of 
Flint is thankfully approach-
ing the issue with efficiency 
and replacement strategies in 
order to eradicate any remain-
ing lead pipes. It is baffling to 
me that people in Michigan are 
still unable to access freshwa-
ter due to unsafe water sources 
and political decisions. A state 
known for its immense amount 
of freshwater access due to 
the beloved Great Lakes can-
not even provide safe drinking 
water to its own people. 
My most fond memories of 
growing up in Michigan are 
trips up north and days spent on 
lakes. My out-of-state friends 
always point out that us Michi-
ganders talk about up north a 
great deal. I have found it acts 
as our safe haven. We yearn to 
road trip upstate to bask in the 
sun, spot the glittering expans-
es of freshwater, dive into clear 
rivers. After the sewage out-
break and the heartbreaking 
state of Flint, how can we be 
sure that Michigan’s beloved 
water will remain unaffected 
by man-made issues? I want to 
know that there are people that 
support our state’s beauty and 
nature. I want to see actions 
that prove there are defend-
ers of the Great Lakes and the 
waters that we call home. 
Thankfully, 
protectors 
of 
our waters do exist: in the 

form of local advocates and 
in the form of the renowned 
non-profit Clean Water Action. 
Clean Water Action has offices 
around the country, spread-
ing their mission in hopes that 
climate change and human 
mistakes will not destroy our 
country’s 
water 
resources. 
In Michigan, there are three 
offices, including one in Ann 
Arbor, that canvas around sev-
eral different townships. Their 
mission is straightforward and 
action-based. It states that they 
strive “To protect our environ-
ment, health, economic well-
being and community quality 
of life.” They also state some 
initiatives for a clean future: 
“Get health-harming toxics out 
of everyday products; protect 
our water from dirty energy 
threats — drilling and frack-
ing for oil and gas, and power 
plant pollution; build a future 
of clean water and clean ener-
gy; keep our clean water laws 
strong and effective to pro-
tect water and health.” Their 
drive to get legislation passed 
and spread the information 
through canvassing is benefi-
cial to promoting environmen-
tal change. 

Meredith Gillies, program 
manager of the Clean Water 
Action 
Ann 
Arbor 
branch, 
weighed in on the importance 
of getting their message across 
to the local community. Gillies 
said, “Polluters in Michigan 
are not required to pay for any 
cleanup of the contamination 
that they cause unless the state 
proves they are responsible in 
court … The legislation we are 
advocating for would reverse 
the burden of proof, requiring 
polluters to prove they are not 
responsible for the release of 
hazardous substances in order 
to avoid paying for cleanup. It 
would also increase cleanup 
standards to ensure that our 

natural resources are pro-
tected.” These companies are 
causing the most harm yet still 
reaping rewards by not having 
to pay for cleanup. Her insider 
perspective helps to provide a 
complete picture of the faults 
of polluters in Michigan. 
Clean Water Action are sup-
porters of keeping Michigan 
waters 
clean 
through 
eco-
conscious legislation. Through 
their Michigan dedicated arti-
cles, I learned about the det-
rimental factors specifically 
in the state of Michigan that 
could affect our water systems 
greatly. For example, climate 
change causes an increase in 
stormwater runoff into the 
Great 
Lakes. 
Unfortunately, 
our state does not have the cor-
rect environmental infrastruc-
ture in place to manage this 
issue. An even more shocking 
fact is that Michigan “remains 
the only state in the United 
States that lacks a statewide 
septic code, and as a conse-
quence, 25 to 30 percent of 
our 1.4 million septic systems 
statewide are failing and leak-
ing more raw and untreated 
sewage into our groundwater,” 
highlighting a need for new 
policy considerations. Michi-
gan 
law-makers, 
politicians 
and citizens should all be sup-
porting Clean Water Action’s 
important work if they believe 
in a human right to clean water. 
Their valuable canvassing and 
campaigning has the potential 
to help generations to come 
by adjusting Michigan’s infra-
structure to the rising effects 
of climate change.
It is vital that we keep our 
freshwaters clean and free from 
corporate harm and man-made 
destruction. Through efforts to 
help residents of Flint, workers 
at Clean Water Action and sup-
porters of waterway protection, 
our source of life will hopefully 
be preserved across the entire 
country. Water access should 
not be solely about politics and 
lobbying, but these actions are 
what provide clear change in 
the way that states and water 
systems are run. If we can set 
aside political affectations, we 
can come together to support 
the universal need of clean 
water. 

Protect our waters

T

his March, 1.4 million 
kids took to the streets 
to protect their futures. 
Some were marked absent from 
school, and many were lambast-
ed by local news outlets, but all 
helped bring to light the threat 
of climate change and govern-
ment inaction. Ever so slowly, 
people are taking note. From the 
World Bank to the New Zealand 
government, those in power are 
recognizing that they must take 
major strides to mitigate the cli-
mate crisis. 
This is not the case at the 
University of Michigan. During 
Ann Arbor’s thousands-strong 
climate change protest, offi-
cials arrested 10 participants 
including University students, 
high school students and com-
munity members. The protesters’ 
demand? Simply for University 
President Mark Schlissel to meet 
and discuss strengthening the 
University’s weak attempts to 
fight the climate crisis. 
The protest and arrests fol-
lowed 
months 
of 
unanimous 
student government resolutions, 
public letters and testimonials at 
Board of Regents meetings aimed 
at getting the University to 
address climate change beyond 
quick fixes and token programs. 
The 
University 
continually 
maintains that it is a big ship and 
it takes a long time to change, but 
we no longer have time to wait. 
Sustainability 
projects 
that 
benefit our campus, like ener-
gy-reduction plans, composting 
programs and educational cam-
paigns, were brought to fruition 
by passionate individuals, but 
the University administration 
refuses to consider long-term 
solutions — like true carbon neu-
trality, renewable energy infra-
structure or education reforms 
— that reflect the urgent action 
we need. 
For instance, along with the 
vague promise to “(put) U-M on 
a trajectory towards carbon neu-
trality,” the University bought 
a greater percent of renewable 
energy, which would be excit-
ing, but the purchase was only 
made as a last-minute, publicity-
generating attempt to reach a 
Planet Blue Sustainability goal 
that should have, instead, been 
met with real innovative energy 
solutions. 
Even the new U-M President’s 
Commission on Carbon Neutral-
ity is an ineffectual response to 

climate activists, lacking direc-
tion, a focus on environmental 
justice and any indication that its 
recommendations will be acted 
upon. During the first commis-
sion meeting, the committee was 
told that the Central Power Plant 
new gas-powered turbine and 
the University’s investments in 
fossil fuels was out of the scope 
of their discussion. This is a huge 
mistake, since emissions from the 
use of gas-powered turbines are 
under-researched and investment 
in fossil fuels increases global 
carbon emissions.
The arrests are a clear attempt 
for the University to hide its com-
plicity in the climate crisis. By 
refusing demands to reshape the 
way it approaches the climate cri-
sis, the University has shown that 
it does not support its students, 
understand the research of its 
faculty or believe in the hercule-
an efforts of its environmentally-
minded staff. By encouraging the 
state prosecutor to press charges 
for arrests made, the University 
administration is disrupting the 
studies and research of its own 
students in order to silence pro-
test; thankfully, the state pros-
ecutor refused U-M’s request to 
charge the 15 and 16 year-olds. 
These are not the actions of an 
institution that supports a safe 
future for its students, nor their 
freedom of speech. 
The University should remem-
ber the forward-thinking institu-
tion it was when it hosted the very 
first Earth Day 50 years ago. You, 
reader, can help to make that hap-
pen. You can write to the people 
listed below and encourage them 
to take appropriate action. 
Here are a few suggestions: 
request the state prosecutor drop 
trespass charges against those 
arrested at the Climate Strike on 
March 15; bind U-M to recom-
mendations from the PCCN and 
instate a dedicated justice advi-
sor; halt the construction of the 
natural gas power plant until 
options for a transition to alter-
nate fuels are explored; begin 
divestment from fossil fuels.
Your voice matters, and we 
need you to use it. Our Univer-
sity will not change unless we as 
a community make clear that it 
needs to, for all of our sakes.

When I find a song to share with 

my mom, I always wait until it’s the 
two of us in the car. It would be dif-
ficult to trace how many of our shared 
obsessions began with this exact 
scene, but I imagine the fugitivity 
of the moment and ourselves on the 
road — minds and bodies alike — are 
somehow linked.

It’s something to do with not hav-

ing to watch her face if I don’t want 
to, which is something to do with fear 
of finding disinterest in it, which is 
something to do with how absurdly 
high stakes these transactions feel to 
me. It doesn’t make me feel like I’m 
in the crosshairs; instead, it calls my 
understanding of the person sitting 
beside me into question.

A folk cover of a Nirvana song 

played between those seats, as did my 
mom’s first contemporary hip-hop 
record, as did the song that initiated 
our (neverending) Solange phase. 
Once, on a night drive during my new 
wave spurt, I queued a sequence that 
started with The Replacements’ “I 
Will Dare,” probably included a Cars 
song I thought she might be able to 
pretend wasn’t the Cars (Dad loves, 
Mom hates), definitely included Echo 
& the Bunnymen and concluded with 
Iggy Pop. She told me she hadn’t lis-
tened to those songs since she was 
around my age, commuting to college 
at U-M Dearborn. 

Those moments, identifying, then 

translating across a synapse I hadn’t 
detected, are the ones I wait for. The 
ones that compensate for the face she 

made when, say, I tried to convince 
her Bob Dylan could sing.

***

I don’t know if I should be writ-

ing about this. I wasn’t there to see 
how it began: with the artful labor of 
creating a mixtape. I’ve never had a 
cassette slipped into my hands, never 
consulted someone’s carefully print-
ed, cryptic title to gather a hint as to 
what I might hear. 

I’ve come of age in the days of Spo-

tify and other digital streaming ser-
vices. I don’t tend to look at the past 
in a way that lends itself to longing, so 
I quickly adapted to an increasingly 
intangible experience with music. 
Even after admiring box after box of 
vinyl, I rarely make purchases at the 
record stores I visit, and I don’t miss 
the choreography of extracting a CD 
without leaving fingerprints on it. 
Does that mean that I have no taste of 
that old-school magic? 

I don’t think so. I think when I 

pull up the Spotify playlist I commis-
sioned from a friend after hearing 
his favorite Kendrick Lamar song by 
chance and finally admitting that I 
had neglected a revolutionary genre 
for too long, I know something of its 
charms. I don’t think that because the 
songs on the digital counterpart of a 
mixtape were easier to compile that 
less attention and care were devoted 
to the act of compiling them. I don’t 
think that kind of transaction will 
ever depreciate if music is still part 
of it.

***

I’ve begun to confuse the absence 

of a person with the absence of their 
music. I’ve begun to confuse the pres-
ence of a person with the sound of 
their music. I’ll give you an example: 

It’s not when I visit the house where 
my Pa once lived that I perceive his 
absence most clearly. That might pro-
ceed in part from my Nana’s refusal 
to move anywhere else and curator-
like preservation of the home they 
once shared. Regardless, it’s when 
I listen to a song and think, I know 
exactly who would love this song, 
and that person is him, and the music 
sharing comes to a sad, jolting halt 
that I know what it means for him to 
be gone.

It got worse when my Grandma 

Laura died. Unlike my Pa’s heart 
attack, her death was anticipated, 
slowly, painfully ambled toward. At 
one point, she gathered her grand-
children around her chair and pre-
sented us with paper butterflies, 
glued to adjustable clips so that we 
could attach it to something. It was 
supposed to be her way of being with 
us, even as her mobility slipped away. 
I cried in the bathroom: Because of 
what it meant, I both wanted and 
didn’t want it in the most severe way.

Six years after her death, in the 

process of moving in and out of col-
lege dorms, I lost the butterfly. One 
of the most fragile, most important 
belongings I have ever had, and ever 
will have. Telling my mom was much 
more shameful, much more distress-
ing than any Catholic sacrament I 
had ever been forced to participate 
in. How could my grandmother ever 
be present if I lost the object in which 
she vested that presence?

I don’t know, but I can tell you that 

I turned to music.

“Paper Butterfly,” I titled it. The 

caption adds, “favorite songs of and 
songs inspired by the favorite songs 
of my grandma, Laura Leigh Schmidt 

(1948-2012).” It’s a playlist on Spo-
tify, with a foundation of Paul Simon 
and Queen (her favorites), a few 
songs of special significance inter-
spersed (Elton John’s “Your Song”: 
the song my mom told me my uncle 
and Grandma Laura danced to at 
his wedding) and, of course, songs 
I wish I could play for her. Yusuf’s 
“If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out.” 
Paul Simon’s not the only one with 
the voice of an angel. Grace Potter & 
The Nocturnals’s “Stars.” I can’t look 
at the stars / They make me wonder 
where you are. Aretha Franklin’s 
“You Make Me Feel Like a Natural 
Woman.” Tell me what that feels like.

That’s more than translating 

across a synapse. It’s the letter I’ll 
never send because I can’t. It’s a lan-
guage for grief, a less painful iteration 
of the imagined conversation, where 
at least the silence, still impervious, is 
disturbed.

***

So I’m confessing once and for all: 

I’m your Spotify stalker. 

I can’t tell you how many essays 

and sorrows and 
long nights your 
playlists and inad-
vertent 
recom-

mendations 
have 

gotten me through, 
so what I should say 
next is thank you.

Thank you for 

luring me into the 
worlds of dream 
pop and contempo-
rary R&B, worlds I’m not sure I could 
have found the entrance to without 
you.

Thank you for dismantling the 

concept of “guilty pleasure,” for lis-
tening publicly, so I can also listen 
publicly to songs I worshipped in 
ninth grade, when I need them to 
remind me of what that time felt like.

And no, I’m not proud of this one, 

but thank you for showing me you’re 
alive when sometimes I wonder. 
When I haven’t heard from you in a 
few days, sometimes I stakeout the 
“Friend Activity” sidebar. Then I’ll 
see your name and your song and 
the speaker with the arcs represent-
ing sound, and I exhale. You’re okay. 
It’s post-punk, so you’re probably not 
happy. But the music is on, so you are 
alright. In adequate hands, for now.

***

I’ve used playlists as the language 

of my grief, so, naturally, I’ve also 
used them to try to make legible fleet-
ing, off-mark feelings that could have 
thickened into something like love. 
“Could have” because I should pref-
ace this with another confession, that 
I forgot how the story goes. It was the 
same promising, blinding boy-meets-
girl, followed by the same violation 

of boundaries, the levying of power 
dynamics, for which boy expresses 
guilt and girl comforts boy. (Who 
comforts girl?)

But between points A and B of 

course, there was music. There were 
songs that said, I’m trying to figure 
out my feelings for you. There were 
careful recommendations that said, 
You might understand this, even 
though no one else has. The songs 
added up in our minds and told us 
what we wanted to believe about one 
another. For me, that was that I found 
a man who wasn’t just luring me in 
with feigned respect for boundar-
ies and limits, who wouldn’t take 
advantage. (I was wrong.) For him, 
it seemed something more like I was 
the antidote to some part of himself, 
with involuntary powers of healing. 
(He was wrong, too.)

These song statements and mis-

representations were housed in Spo-
tify’s collaborative playlist function. 
We had two of them; especially in 
the beginning, I would contemplate 
my contribution obsessively. I tried 

to calculate all the 
ways it could mis-
fire, both in terms of 
whether he would 
actually like it and 
whether it would 
say what I want-
ed it to say. And 
I would wait for 
his response song, 
check the playlists 
obsessively, 
listen 

the moment he added something. 

One day, close to the end, at a time 

where I was somewhere between 
wanting to see him often and feeling 
like I was supposed to want to see 
him often, I was walking to work. It 
was cold and I’d forgotten the ear-
muffs he’d once complimented. To 
make matters worse, my hair was 
pulled back, so the wind gnawed 
mercilessly at both ears. I inserted an 
earbud in each, numbness still blos-
soming, and queued the most recent 
songs he added to one of the playlists. 

One was about finding a reason to 

live in another person, which he had 
promised I wasn’t, that he wouldn’t 
let one person be that, but the song 
still had warmth. Another was about 
a couple’s atypical, wonderfully 
awkward track to falling in love. I 
felt a flood of warmth, starting with 
my ears. His songs playing in them, 
their lyrics I figured might as well 
be his words, warmed me from the 
inside out, swirled around my head, 
dizzying, almost fashioning a pair 
of earmuffs out of thin air and a few 
well-sung notes.

In the truest sense of the word, a 

“mixtape” is a compilation of songs 
that come from multiple sources. 
This definition harkens back to the 
days before digital playlists. Mix-
tapes were not endlessly augmented, 
so they were often made with a cer-
tain vibe or theme in mind. 

In the mid to late 2000s hip-hop 

scene, though, the definition began 
to change. At this time, a mixtape 
was essentially a free album that 
could not be held accountable for 
any sort of uncleared sample or 
copyright 
infringement. 
Entire 

careers were made off of this plat-
form. Take Lil Wayne for example: 
Some fans only listen to mixtape 
Weezy. That’s how popular mix-
tapes were for a time. Today, the def-
inition of a mixtape is changing once 
again. Mixtapes are being released 
for profit, but they are intended to 
be taken less seriously than a nor-
mal studio album. With his latest 
release Angel’s Pulse, Blood Orange, 
also known as Dev Hynes, combines 
each interpretation of the mixtape 
into one final product.

Hynes said during the tape’s 

short promotional period that after 
each album he creates, he also cre-
ates a mixtape of sorts to serve as 
an epilogue. He usually gives these 
mixtapes to friends and random 
passersby, but for the first time, 
Hynes is sharing one of these tapes 
with the world.

Angel’s Pulse serves as the epi-

logue to Hynes’s phenomenal 2018 
release Negro Swan. It fleshes out 

any incomplete ideas and wraps 
up this chapter of Hynes’s career. 
With this mixtape, Hynes explores 
the different sounds presented on 
Negro Swan and experiments with 
their strengths and limitations in 
a context that is not meant to be 
taken as seriously as an album. With 
that said, the sound is not cohesive 
throughout, true to the original defi-
nition of a mixtape. Angel’s Pulse is 
a collection of songs that Hynes felt 
effectively represented this moment 
in his life.

Despite the implications of the 

word “mixtape,” Angel’s Pulse 
deserves to be taken seriously. It’s 

lighthearted, but that doesn’t mean 
it’s not heartfelt. Opening track “I 
Wanna C U” is bouncy and loved up. 
It ponders Hynes’s relationship with 
the person trapped in his head. It’s 
very sweet sounding, but the repeti-
tive nature of the song makes Hynes 
seem almost tortured in a way, as if 
performing the song is the only way 
to make the person in his head man-
ifest themselves in real life.

In stark sonic contrast to “I 

Wanna C U” are “Dark & Hand-
some” and “Benzo.” The songs 
depart from the light tone of “I 
Wanna C U” to a more contempla-
tive and somber sound, but they 
share the same themes and suggest 

the mixtape’s overall concept. “Dark 
& Handsome” yearns for days long 
gone as Hynes’ sings, “Nothing lasts 
forever, and I told you / Everything 
you need to know is not true / Lyin’ 
to myself because it hurts you.” 
“Benzo” continues this theme of 
yearning for something that is not 
there. He laments, “Open the door, 
leave with arms exposed / Outside, 
I saw where I belong.” Hynes knows 
what will make him content, but the 
only way he can get there is if he can 
leave the past behind him.

Angel’s Pulse continues this 

theme of yearning for an altered 
past with the heartwrenching “Bir-
mingham,” a reflection on the 1963 
16th Street Baptist Church bomb-
ing in Birmingham, Alabama that 
tragically took the lives of four chil-
dren, and “Baby Florence (Figure),” 
a track in which Hynes assures his 
partner that he will help deter-
mine where their relationship went 
wrong. However, mixtape standout 
“Gold Teeth” seems a stark depar-
ture from this theme. The track is 
stacked, featuring Tinashe, Gangsta 
Boo and Project Pat. It’s highlighted 
by braggadocio and talks of life in 
the streets over a chopped sample of 
Project Pat’s “Rinky Dink II/We’re 
Gonna Rumble.” Everything on the 
track screams assuredness: Project 
Pat’s gruff delivery on the refrain, 
Gangsta Boo’s empowering verse 
and Hynes and Tinashe’s lush, con-
fident chorus. Despite all this, it still 
falls perfectly in line with the vibe 
of the mixtape. It presents a desire 
to be someone who does what they 
want, when they want to do it.

Hynes redefines ‘mixtape’

ALBUM REVIEW

THE NEW YORK TIMES

On July 11, Nevertheless Film 

Festival, founded and directed by 
University FTVM alum Meredith 
Finch, launched its inaugural run at 
the Michigan Theater. The festival 
assembled a wide variety of feature-
length and short films, all created by 
female-identifying filmmakers. 

The name was inspired by wom-

en’s rights motto, “Nevertheless, she 
persisted.” Within the film indus-
try, equal representation behind 
and in front of the lens has been, 
to say the least, 
concerning. 
In 

2017, USC Annen-
berg 
conducted 

a 
study 
which 

found that across 
the 
top 
movies 

from 2007 to 2016, 
only four percent 
of the respective 
directors 
were 

female. However, 
filmmakers 
who 

identify as female 
make up at least 
half of the leader-
ship behind every 
film presented at Nevertheless, as 
proclaimed in every program given 
out at each showing. 

Between actors speaking publicly 

about the need for more women in 
the film industry — like Regina King 
vowing to make future projects 50 
percent female during her Golden 
Globe acceptance speech — and 
sexual misconduct running rampant 
around the industry, the festival sets 
a much needed precedent for the 
next generation of filmmakers. 

Two films were screened open-

ing night: “Throat Singing in Kan-
girsuk,” directed by Eva Kaukai and 
Manon Chamberland, as well as 
“A Colony.” directed by Genevieve 
Dulude-De Celles. The former was 
a three-minute short film, which 
managed to blow my mind in just 
that amount of time. It depicted the 
rugged Arctic terrain of the direc-
tors’ home of Kangirsuk, a village in 
Quebec, Canada, while they throat 
sang their way through the short. 
The guttural and, at first, borderline-
frightening throat-singing acted as a 

complete contrast to the peaceful, 
snowy landscape.

Next was the full-length film “A 

Colony,” screened in French with 
English subtitles. Sometimes, I find 
that watching a movie with subtitles 
adds a layer between the viewer 
and the film which can hinder emo-
tional connection, but the subtitles 
did not take away from the immer-
sion. Language was one of the many 
themes throughout that added to the 
endearing and fragile nature of the 
piece. 

Along with showing films, the 

festival held panels that were free 
to attend. Connecting film audi-
ences with these filmmakers gave 

a perspective to 
movies that many 
in Ann Arbor have 
yet to experience. 
Held 
in 
North 

Quad at Michi-
gan, the various 
filmmakers spoke 
on their creative 
process as well as 
what drew them 
to their respective 
projects. The main 
objective of these 
panels being to 
connect film audi-
ences with film-

makers, a privilege afforded to both 
parties. Every filmmaker exuded 
excitement and gratitude. It was sur-
real to see such high-quality work 
and then get the filmmaker’s per-
spective on it. After certain show-
ings, viewers even had the option to 
head over to HopCat afterwards to 
share a beer with the filmmaker. 

Nevertheless Film Festival was a 

refreshing and soul-fulfilling break 
from this summer’s superhero mov-
ies. As I entered the Michigan The-
ater, women smiled at me from the 
welcome desk encouraging me to 
take whatever swag I wanted. Scat-
tered along their table were pins 
with “the future of film is female” 
emblazoned on them. I shyly took 
two of those with anticipation of 
adorning it on my rapidly deterio-
rating backpack for senior year. Not 
only is the festival socially beneficial, 
but the selection of films was easily 
the most emotionally nuanced I’ve 
seen this summer. I’m looking for-
ward to seeing what they have in 
store for Ann Arbor next year.

Hundreds 
of 
community 
members gathered at the Federal 
Building on Friday night for the 
Ann Arbor: Lights for Liberty 
vigil, joining more than seven 

hundred events planned around 
the world to bring awareness to 
and demand an end to conditions 
at immigration detention centers 
along the southern U.S. border.
Waving homemade signs and 
candles, protesters filled Liberty 
Street from Fourth Street to Fifth 
Street, which was closed off for 

the event. The mission statement 
on the official Lights for Liberty 
website 
said 
the 
events 
are 
planned to call out the “inhumane 
conditions faced by migrants.”
“We are a coalition of people, 
many of whom are mothers, 
dedicated to human rights, and 
the fundamental principle behind 

democracy that all human beings 
have a right to life, liberty and 
dignity,” the website reads. 
As migrant families fleeing 
violence 
and 
poverty 
from 
Central America continue to be 
apprehended on the southern 
border 
in 
record-breaking 
numbers, 
an 
independent 
watchdog of the Department of 
Homeland 
Security 
reported 
“dangerous 
overcrowding” 
in 
migrant holding facilities. 
Held 
for 
days, 
weeks 
or 
sometimes months past the 72 hour 
limit for short-term detention, 
migrants awaiting processing live 
in “squalid” conditions and often 
without necessary medical care. 
Twenty-four 
immigrants 
have 
died in U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement care thus 
far, including seven children. 
In late June, Congress approved 
a $4.6 billion aid package for 
these detention facilities, passing 
a less restrictive Senate bill in 
a compromise by the House of 
Representatives. On Wednesday, 
the House Oversight and Reform 
Committee conducted a hearing 
on detention conditions. 
Discovery of a secret Border 
Patrol Facebook group in which 
former 
and 
current 
agents 
joked about migrant deaths and 
threatened Latinx legislators has 
also provoked further outrage 
and an investigation into the 
group. 
The vigils come ahead of 
ICE plans to begin arrests and 

deportations of undocumented 
individuals in 10 major cities this 
coming Sunday. Ann Arbor Lights 
for 
Liberty 
organizer 
Corky 
Wattles reminded the audience of 
this fact as she began the event. 
Wattles led the audience in 
chants of “Don’t look away” 
before her opening remarks and 
explained the latter half of the 
event would be “solemn” and “in 
mourning” of border conditions. 
In her speech, she particularly 
urged 
young 
people 
in 
the 
audience to vote and become 
involved in activist efforts.
“Kids, 
hear 
me 
now: 
if 
everyone gets involved we can 
take our country back, the land 
of 
liberty 
and 
compassion,” 
Wattles said. “Not voting is never 
an option… Doing nothing is no 
longer an option.”
Earlier in the night, Wattles 
told the audience the event staff 
was collecting donations for 
several organizations. Rebeca 
Ontiveros-Chavez, an attorney 
at one of those organizations, 
the 
Michigan 
Immigrants 
Rights Center, spoke about her 
work representing hundreds of 
children in immigration court 
for deportation proceedings and 
other immigration matters.
“I want to make absolutely 
clear that it is not unlawful 
to seek asylum in the United 
States,” Ontiveros-Chavez said.

Michigan has options as it tries to replace studded senior class

Carol Hutchins often touted 
the 2019 senior class as one of the 
best she’s ever had.
After falling out of the top-25 
for the first time in a decade, the 
seniors took it upon themselves 
to right the ship. A 12-10 start was 
followed by a 31-1 record heading 
into the postseason, giving the 
Wolverines an opportunity to 
host a regional as the No. 15 
seed. And though Michigan fell 
to James Madison in the winner-
takes-all game of the regional, 
Hutchins was effusive in her 
praise of her seniors. 
If the Wolverines want to 
replicate any sort of the success 
they had this year, they will need 
to fill the voids the senior class 
is leaving. With the offseason 
already in full swing for the 
softball team, The Daily looks at 
possible replacements for each 
vacant position.
Second baseman
Not only will Michigan need to 
find a new leadoff hitter but it will 
be searching for its new anchor 
after the departure of two-time 
All-American 
Faith 
Canfield. 
Following a quiet freshman year 
where she was backup to former 

four-time All-American Sierra 
Romero, Canfield took the reins 
in 2017 and became another 
household name. She started 
every single game for Michigan 
the last three years, posting a 
minimum batting average of .391 
each season including a .404 
average in 2019. Her .617 slugging 
percentage 
and 
.482 
on-base 
percentage this past year both 
were team-highs — exactly what 
any team wants out of its leadoff 
hitter. 
However, Michigan has its 
options to fill the gap. Sophomore 
Morgan Overaitis seems like the 
most logical fit at this position 
as she played 32 games during 
her freshman campaign and 
earned nine starts. Her best 
performance 
came 
against 
Illinois 
State 
as 
designated 
player when she hit two-for-
five with two RBI, showing her 
ability to get hits with runners in 
scoring position.
Then 
there 
is 
standout 
incoming 
freshman 
Julia 
Jimenez. Though she primarily 
played 
shortstop 
and 
third 
baseman 
throughout 
high 
school, 
her 
infield 
instincts 
might be able to translate to 
second base. Her high school 
batting statistics were nothing 

short of spectacular, either. The 
No. 13-ranked recruit, according 
to Softball America, hit at a 
.520-clip with 31 RBI during her 
senior year. Perhaps her most 
impressive 
statistic, 
though, 
is that she struck out just six 
times in her high school career, 
proving that she has the ability 
to continue the legacy of the last 
two Wolverine second basemen.
First baseman
If there was one position in the 
lineup that wasn’t set at the start 
of this past season, it was the 
first baseman. But by the end of 
the year, Alex Sobczak proved to 
be deserving of the spot. After a 
convoluted college career where 
she showed flashes of potential, 
Sobczak broke out in her final 
season, batting cleanup and tied 
for the team lead in home runs 
with 10 while finishing second in 
RBI with 42. 
It seems likely, though, that 
junior Taylor Bump will take 
over. Though Sobczak ended 
up beating her out for the 
starting job, Bump continued to 
earn playing time on defense, 
especially in the postseason, 
due to her reliable glove. Bump 
will need to prove that she can 
produce consistent results in the 
batter’s box, though, which could 

make or break her case for the 
starting role. 
Catcher
Though she ended her final 
season with a non-contact knee 
injury in the regional, Katie 
Alexander left her mark on the 
Wolverines. She contributed 10 
home runs to an offense that 
struggled to put balls over the 
fence and had just one error, 
maintaining a fielding percentage 
of .997.
However, if the end of the 
season was indicative of who can 
replace Katie Alexander, it seems 
like sophomore Hannah Carson 
will get the green light. Carson, a 
top-25 recruit out of high school, 
played the entire regional, batting 
at a .417-clip with two doubles 
and an RBI. She also showed 
great maturity behind the plate, 
committing no errors on the year. 
Designated Player
After a turbulent career at 
Michigan, 
Mackenzie 
Nemitz 
persevered 
through 
injuries 
and fluctuating playing time to 
solidify herself as designated 
player. Sister of former Michigan 
great Nikki Nemitz, Mackenzie 
had a batting average of .288 
with five home runs and 31 RBIs. 
She started 41 games for the 
Wolverines and even showed that 

she could play third baseman 
when Madison Uden was in a 
slump.
In 
the 
postseason, 
rising 
junior Lou Allan pinch hit for 
Nemitz and showed flashes of 
potential to get on base. Driving 
home a crucial RBI as a pinch 
hitter in the Big Ten Tournament 
final and even earning a start at 
designated player in Michigan’s 
most important game of the year 
against James Madison. Allan 
was given plenty of opportunities 
to capitalize once she came back 
from the injury that has hindered 
her for much of her college 
career. Assuming that she can 
stay injury-free, it wouldn’t be 
a surprise if Hutchins inserts 
her into the starting lineup next 
season.
Jimenez could also be another 
option to replace Nemitz if 
Overaitis 
wins 
the 
second 
baseman 
position. 
With 
her 
impressive batting average and 
.940 slugging percentage in high 
school, Hutchins might want 
Jimenez to contribute to the 
Wolverine offense right away.
Center Fielder
As a staple of the Michigan 
offense and defense the last two 
years, Natalie Peters started 
almost 
every 
game 
for 
the 
Wolverines. With a .352 batting 
average 
during 
her 
senior 
season, she had the third-most 
consistent bat on the team. She 
also was the best baserunner for 
Michigan, stealing a team-high 
15 bases on 16 attempts. Losing 
such consistency at the top of the 
batting lineup and speed in the 
outfield will not be an easy task 
for the Wolverines to replace, 
especially when their options 
have not received much playing 
time.
The 
most 
experienced 
replacement 
would 
be 
rising 
sophomore 
Grace 
Chelemen. 
She primarily entered games as 
a pinch runner, showing that she 
could replicate Peters’ speed and 
baserunning, but she only received 
seven at-bats on the season and 
produced just one hit. 
On the other hand, there is No. 
28-ranked incoming freshman Lexi 
Voss. Her .644 batting average was 
topped off by 19 home runs and 
70 RBI in her senior campaign. 
This type of power is significantly 
different from Peters’ slap-hitting 
style and Voss has the ability to add 
another dimension to a Michigan 
offense that lacked power last year.

Wolverines’ newcomers have ability to make immediate impact

Out with the old, in with the 
new.
This 
fall, 
the 
Michigan 
volleyball team will welcome a 
highly-touted group of freshmen 
to Ann Arbor. The class is 
comprised of outside hitters Jess 
Robinson and May Pertofsky, 
setter Madison Dowd and libero 
Amber Beals.
Robinson, an in-state product 
from 
Troy, 
was 
selected 
to 
Volleyball Magazine’s Fab 50 — a 
prestigious list of the best high 
school seniors in the country, as 
voted on by a panel of Division I 
coaches. She tallied 1,714 kills, 588 
digs, 122 aces and 101 blocks in 
her first three high school seasons 
en route to Prep Volleyball All-
American honors.
Her 6-foot-2 front row presence 
was felt across the nation on the 
club circuit, earning her the No. 8 
spot in Prep Volleyball’s national 
recruiting rankings.
“We see (Robinson) as an elite 
national recruit,” said Wolverines’ 
head coach Mark Rosen in a 
release. “We’ve been tracking 
(Robinson’s) 
development 
for 
quite some time, and we truly 
feel she’s one of the top players 
nationally in the 2019 class. She’s 
a local player and plays for a local 
club team, so we’ve been able to 

see her strong development and 
believe her ceiling for development 
is limitless. She’s a phenomenal 
athlete, but she’s still very young 
in her development and has a lot of 
room to grow.
“… I think she’s somebody that 
can impact us really early in her 
career, but we definitely feel that 
she’s an elite recruit with great 
room to develop who has the 
chance to be an elite collegiate 
player.”
Rosen 
was 
attracted 
to 
Robinson’s 
ceiling 
throughout 
the recruiting process, but he 
also values her versatility. She has 
experience as a middle blocker, 
where Michigan struggled last 
season following then-redshirt 
junior Cori Crocker’s ankle injury. 
Robinson could see playing time at 
either the middle position or the 
left pin this fall.
While acclimating to the college 
level, Robinson’s most impactful 
attribute could be her vertical 
leap.
“Robinson doesn’t just jump 
off the page, she nearly jumps 
out the building,” wrote Drew 
Ellis of Prep Dig, a volleyball 
prospect evaluation website, last 
September.
Pertofsky, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
other early signee, hails from Los 
Angeles, Calif. The Max Preps 
All-American racked up three All-
League Gold Coast MVP awards 

during her high school career. At 
6-foot-1, she brings formidable 
size across the front row.
Like Robinson, her versatility 
could lead to immediate playing 
time.
“(Pertofsky’s) strength and what 
she’s going to bring to us is that 
she could play multiple positions,” 
Rosen said. “She can play in the 
middle, on the right or on the left. 
She’s a good physical athlete that is 
fast, explosive, jumps well and has 
a good arm swing. She has all the 
tools that will allow us to put her 
in a position to create an impact 
for us and allow her to be very 
successful. We’re leaning (towards 
using) her as a middle blocker, but 
there’s a lot of options with her, 
which makes it very exciting.
“(Pertofsky) is used to winning 
at the highest level so she’s coming 
in as someone who is ready to 
compete at a high level, and I think 
she’s going to be a great addition to 
our program.”
As for Beals, she brings just 
about everything to the table that 
Robinson and Pertfosky lack. 
She could see an opportunity to 
make an impact this season as a 
defensive substitution or serving 
specialist following the graduation 
of Maddy Abbott, who played that 
role in 2018.
The Columbus native, who 
earned 
Junior 
Volleyball 
Association All-American honors 

in high school, will compete with 
rising senior Kyleigh Hamacher 
for such duties.
A late signee, Dowd rounded out 
the class in May after flipping her 
commitment from Georgetown. 
She was a finalist for Michigan’s 
coveted Miss Volleyball Award 
and, like Robinson, played for 
Legacy Volleyball Club. Dowd 
will battle it out with rising senior 
Katerina Rocafort for primary 
backup setter duties this fall.
Rosen has established a strong 
pipeline from Legacy to Ann 
Arbor. Crocker, rising sophomore 
outside hitter Abbey Malinowski 
and a handful of recent program 
alumni all came from the club. On 
the other hand, Pertofsky played 

for Sunshine Volleyball Club, the 
same program as rising redshirt 
junior Ellie Brooks.
But, 
regardless 
of 
where 
they came from, the incoming 
freshmen will be tasked with 
helping Michigan succeed in the 
Big Ten gauntlet immediately.
“We’re really excited about 
this class,” Rosen said. “They’re 
all very different in terms of 
how they’ll impact our program, 
but they’re all very athletic and 
they’re all players that are used 
to winning. They’ve all played 
on great club and high school 
teams that are used to winning 
and competing at a high level, so 
I think they all have a chance to 
come in and make us better.”

Howard announces new coaching staff hires for upcoming season

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
coach Juwan Howard announced 
new staff hires Monday. Most 
notable among the additions is 
the return of Jay Smith to Ann 
Arbor. Smith will serve as the 
director of player personnel and 
development.
Howard 
and 
Smith 
share 
a relationship dating back to 
Smith’s time as an assistant coach 
for the Wolverines from 1989-
1996 and was part of the effort 
that helped recruit the Fab Five.
“There are many people who 
have helped me throughout my 
career; however, Jay Smith is 
someone special who I have a 
deep connection with and the 
utmost 
respect 
for,” 
Howard 
said in a press release. “He has 

such an incredible passion for 
the game and his ability to relate 
with young men is going to be 
something invaluable for us. We 
are very fortunate to have him 
return to Ann Arbor and join our 
staff.”
After 
his 
first 
stint 
with 
Michigan, Smith went on to earn 
his first head coaching job at 
Grand Valley State where he won 
the Great Lakes Intercollegiate 
Athletic 
Conference 
regular 
season 
and 
tournament 
championships, 
leading 
his 
team to an NCAA Division II 
Tournament appearance. He was 
also the head coach of the Central 
Michigan basketball team for 
nine seasons which included an 
appearance in the second round 
of the NCAA Tournament. Most 
recently, he spent the last three 
seasons as the head coach at 

Kalamazoo College.
“There are always interesting 
twists in this game,” Smith 
said. “That can be said for this 
situation. I have been through 
plenty over the last few years and 
loved the opportunity Kalamazoo 
trusted in me. However, the 
chance to help out Juwan and 
return to Michigan is something 
my family and I are excited about 
and thankful for.”
Howard also decided to retain 
Chris Hunter as the Wolverines’ 
director of basketball operations. 
Hunter has spent the last three 
seasons in the director role and 
will begin his sixth season overall 
with Michigan.
In addition, Howard brought 
back 
former 
guard 
Jaaron 
Simmons 
as 
the 
graduate 
manager. Simmons was a part of 
the 2017-2018 team that appeared 

in the national championship 
game 
and 
will 
be 
working 
towards his master’s degree in 
social work.
The 
final 
hiring 
Howard 
announced was adding David 

Metzendorf as the team’s video 
analyst. Metzendorf is an Ann 
Arbor native and spent the past 
three seasons at Holy Cross as 
director of basketball operations 
and assistant coach.

After a season filled with questions, some answers for Michigan 

OMAHA, Neb. – For much of the 
season, there were questions swirling 
around the Michigan baseball team. 
Now, on the far side of an improbable 
ride that brought Team 153 to the 
finals of the College World Series – 
and on the far side of a crushing 8-2 
loss at the hands of No. 2 Vanderbilt 
– the answers to those questions are 
starting to become clear.
For a long time, there were 
serious doubts about whether any 
school from the Big Ten belongs 
in college baseball’s Top 25. They 
struggled 
with 
cold 
weather, 
struggled losing recruits to southern 
schools, struggled putting together 
consistently successful teams.
But this season has proven that 
that’s no longer the case. Michigan 
was in and out of the rankings all 
season. But this year has cemented 
the fact that the Big Ten is quickly 
becoming 
a 
relevant 
baseball 
conference again. Iowa, Minnesota, 
Indiana and Illinois all put together 
teams that looked as if they could 
threaten to make postseason runs. 
In a few years’ time, with continued 
improvement from programs that are 
investing more and more into being 
national contenders, the Big Ten is 
beginning to challenge the notion 

that only warm-weather schools can 
build baseball powerhouses.
Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan 
have been ranked this season — 
Illinois and Indiana for weeks at a 
time. They’ve all proven that they’ve 
earned those rankings.
So, yes, Big Ten baseball teams 
belong in the top 25.
At the very beginning of the 
season, it looked like Michigan might 
be that Big Ten team. The Wolverines 
were ranked – albeit in the last five of 
the top 25 – and started the season 
on an eight-game winning streak 
with sweeps of Binghamton and the 
Citadel. But after a rough California 
swing and a devastating three-
game sweep at the hands of No. 8 
Texas Tech, Michigan fell out of the 
rankings, phasing in and out for the 
rest of the season.
But this postseason run has made 
one thing clear: this wasn’t just a top-
25 team. It was a top-five team. This 
was a team that took down some of 
the best ballclubs in the country — the 
likes of UCLA and Texas Tech. This 
was a team that had the potential to 
be a national champion, a team that 
was one game away from that result, 
a team that was disappointed to finish 
second in the country.
So, yes, Michigan belongs in the 
top 25, at least.
At the beginning of the season, 

junior left-hander Tommy Henry 
looked untouchable, allowing no 
earned runs in four of his first five 
starts. But nagging bicep tendonitis 
rendered him inconsistent through 
much of the second half of the 
season, and it became unclear if he 
could show up for Michigan when it 
mattered.
But in the postseason, when 
his team needed him most, Henry 
became the backbone of the pitching 
staff. He threw a dominant, flu-ridden 
seven innings over UCLA to send his 
team to the College World Series, 
a masterpiece 100-pitch complete-
game shutout of Florida State, and a 
victory in Game 1 of the College World 
Series Final. He finished the season 
with a 3.27 earned-run average and 
a legacy of massive games on the 
collegiate sport’s highest level.
So, yes, Tommy Henry can pitch 
when it matters.
He can. He did.
In his first three years with the 
program that both his father and 
grandfather played for, senior first 
baseman Jimmy Kerr was a non-
starter who had his moments. He 
fought to live up to the legacy of his 
father and grandfather who both 
went to the College World Series with 
Michigan. But after an offseason 
spent hard at work lifting weights 
and putting on bulk, Kerr finally 

came into his own.
He hit a team-leading 15 home 
runs in his breakout senior season. 
Seven of those homers came in the 
NCAA Tournament. He started every 
game this past year and captained a 
team that made its first College World 
Series trip since his father’s playing 
days.
His father went to Omaha twice in 
the eighties. His grandfather was the 
backbone of the 1962 championship 
team.
It’s a tall legacy – but yes, Jimmy 
can live up to it.
He can. He did.
Above all, though, there was one 
question surrounding this ballclub: 

can Bakich build a powerhouse 
program at Michigan?
He’s certainly planted the seeds of 
one. This postseason run, this trip to 
Omaha, this appearance in the finals 
of the College World Series have 
proven that.
But can he get back here? Can he 
recruit well enough to replace the 
losses of seniors like Jimmy Kerr and 
Blake Nelson and draftees like Karl 
Kauffmann and Tommy Henry? Can 
he cultivate a winning culture and a 
consistently-winning program that 
bring future Michigan teams back to 
Omaha?
It’s time to find out.
But as of now, all signs point to yes.

Michigan players find new challenge in Cape Cod Baseball League

CAPE COD, Mass. — Jesse 
Franklin smacked a single, then 
motored into second on the throw 
home.
Waiting for him there was none 
other than Jack Blomgren. Reunited 
briefly with his Michigan teammate, 
Franklin took the opportunity to 
mess around with Blomgren.
Franklin and Blomgren are two 
of three Wolverines who headed 
to Cape Cod for summer ball after 
their second-place finish in the 
College World Series. Franklin plays 
outfield for the Brewster Whitecaps, 
Blomgren is an infielder with the 
Wareham Gatemen and left-hander 
Angelo Smith pitches for the Orleans 
Firebirds.
The Cape Cod Baseball League, a 
summer league for college baseball 
players, is in some ways a far cry from 
Ray Fisher Stadium. Players trade in 
their dorms for host families, joining 

a team of high-level players from all 
over the country. Sometimes, they 
play against their own teammates.
The fields harken back to the old 
days of baseball. Many are located at 
high schools. Some still don’t have 
lights. All have real grass, not the 
turf to which Michigan players are 
accustomed, and players on the home 
team must tend to the field after 
games. The sounds are different, too 
— the “crack” of wood bats replacing 
the “clink” of aluminum ones. But in 
the end, it’s still the same game.
“It’s awesome,” Franklin — who 
also spent last summer with the 
Whitecaps — told The Daily. “It’s a 
good shot to get a lot better, play with 
really good players, meet different 
guys from around the country and 
guys I’ve played against and just kind 
of share in baseball.”
The College World Series threw 
a wrench into the Wolverines’ plans 
this year. Michigan wasn’t expected 
to even make it to Super Regionals, 
so coaches expected to have them 

right away. Instead, the Wolverines 
didn’t come until halfway through 
the season.
Franklin was in Ann Arbor for two 
days after the final game, then went 
home for a week before flying out to 
the Cape. He didn’t appear in a game 
until July 9, the 23rd of 44 games 
for Brewster. Smith and Blomgren 
didn’t play their first games until 
July 11 and 12, respectively.
And there’s another element of 
collateral 
damage. 
Right-hander 
Jeff Criswell and outfielder Jordan 
Nwogu were also slated to come 
to the Cape, but Criswell decided 
to eschew it for the USA Baseball 
Collegiate 
National 
Team 
and 
Nwogu stayed home to rest a quad 
injury he suffered against Vanderbilt. 
Still, the coaches are happy to have 
them — better late than never.
“I’m always gonna have Michigan 
kids,” said Whitecaps manager 
Jamie Shevchik. “Their coaches do 
things the right way, I have a great 
relationship with the Michigan 

coaching staff. … Some of these 
programs, their coaches do a great 
job of understanding where they are 
and what the Cape Cod means to 
them.”
The Cape League is a little more 
relaxed 
than 
NCAA 
baseball. 
Instead of the bright lights and the 
pressure and the cheering fans like 
the College World Series or a home 
Michigan game, contests have an 
intimate feel. Little kids come on 
the field asking for autographs 
afterwards. In some ways, that’s a 
good thing, but it comes with its own 
challenges.
“There’s no coaches here or 
academic advisers or people like that 
looking out for me,” Franklin said. 
“I’ve gotta be responsible for myself 
and warm up correctly and work out 
by myself and eat the right things 
and do things in my best interest.”
Many players struggle at first 
on the Cape, whether because of 
the new wood bats, playing against 
different competition or simply 

the adjustment of being in a new 
place. That’s certainly been true of 
Franklin, Blomgren and Smith so 
far. Franklin is hitting .273 with a 
.360 on-base percentage, but all of 
his hits have been singles. Blomgren 
is 1-for-5 with four strikeouts in 
two games. Smith had a scoreless 
2.1-inning appearance in a loss, but 
then allowed two runs and two 
walks and committed an error in just 
0.2 innings in his next.
But no matter their final stats, 
playing in the Cape League will help 
each player improve against top-
notch competition and get used to 
the way things are done in the pros 
— whether that be wood bats, the 
challenges of self-starting or playing 
games almost every day. Ultimately, 
that’s the most important part.
“Just the opportunity to get better 
every day,” Franklin said. “You get 
to play so often and it’s always a 
challenge out here, so it feels like I’m 
getting better and that’s what I want 
to do the most.”
