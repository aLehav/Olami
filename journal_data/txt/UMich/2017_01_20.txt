As 
a 
result 
of 
a 
new 

partnership between the Ross 
School of Business’s Center for 
Social Impact in Ann Arbor and 
the University of Michigan-
Flint’s 
Office 
of 
University 

Outreach, the sixth annual 
Social Impact Challenge will 
take place in Flint this semester 
instead of Detroit.

In previous years, the Center 

for Social Impact has held 
its Social Impact Challenges 
in 
Detroit, 
where 
teams 

partnered 
with 
different 

community 
and 
nonprofit 

organizations 
to 
develop 

solutions 
to 
problems 
in 

the city. Last year, students 
aided in the launch of Detroit 
Police Athletic League’s Kids 
at the Corner Campaign in 
partnership with the old 
Tiger Stadium Conservancy.

However, after the Flint 

Water Crisis left community 
members feeling devastated, 
student 
participants 
of 

the Challenge shifted the 
program’s focus to bring 
economic 
development 
to 

Flint neighborhoods, as well as 
the city center, through their 
collaboration, innovation and 
entrepreneurship.

Glenn Bugala, marketing 

manager for the Center for 
Social Impact, said the Center 
is not only working with 
UM-Flint for the Challenge 
but also the city of Flint itself 

in an effort to join the two 
communities together.

“In addition to working with 

UM-Flint Office of University 
Outreach, we will be working 
on the case with community 
partners, the city of Flint and 
Skypoint Ventures — a venture 
capital and real estate company 
with strong social impact ties,” 
Bugala said. “Furthermore, our 
finals will be presented March 
15 at the Flint Institute of Arts 
as part of the Arts 

and Social Entrepreneurship 
Symposium, at which School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance 
Dean Aaron Dworkin will be a 
keynote speaker.”

Bugala noted the connection 

between the Center for Social 
Impact and UM Flint is special 
because, for the first time, 
students 
can 
form 
teams 

consisting 
of 
participants 

from more than one campus, 
bringing diversity of thought to 

the program.

“Being in Flint puts us on 

the front line of a city that has 
captured the attention of the 
country,” Bugala said. “For the 
first time, we will be partnering 
with another University of 
Michigan 
campus 
to 
offer 

this opportunity. UM-Flint’s 
Outreach Office is uniquely 
poised to provide background, 
contacts and insights for future 

After serving the University 

of Michigan for seven years, 
Holly 
Rider-Milkovich, 
the 

director of the Sexual Assault 
Prevention 
and 
Awareness 

Center, announced on Jan. 13 
she is stepping down from her 
position.

SAPAC, a University entity, 

trains students to act as a peer 
network for survivors of sexual 
assault on campus and further 
aims to advocate for social 
change by offering professional 
services, such as counseling and 
crisis hotlines, for the campus 
community. During her tenure 
as 
director, 
the 
University 

was placed under Title IX 
investigation, and the sexual 
assault policy was updated.

In an email interview with 

the Daily, University spokesman 
Rick Fitzgerald wrote Rider-
Milkovich contributed greatly 
in bringing sexual misconduct 
to the forefront of University 
discussion.

Through 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
is 
currently 

embarking upon a series of 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 
initiatives, 
the 
University 

still ranks low nationally in 
socioeconomic diversity among 
students.

According to a recent report 

from The Upshot in the New 
York Times, the median family 
income of a student is $154,000 
— the highest of 27 public 
colleges classified as “highly 
selective.”

The Upshot also reported 

that 66 percent of students 
come from the top 20 percent of 
the income distribution, and 9.3 
percent of students come from 
the top 1 percent of the income 
distribution — also the highest 
of the 27 institutions. 

Additionally, the University 

ranked last out of 25 highly 
selective 
public 
colleges 
in 

terms 
of 
economic 
social 

mobility. The report states that 

only 10 percent of University 
alumni moved up two or more 
income quintiles. Stony Brook 
University in New York came 
in first with 34 percent and 
University of California-Irvine 
came in second with 27 percent.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald said it will take time 
for the DEI initiatives to make 
significant gains, but there are 
many promising programs in 
the works, and the University 
has 
already 
begun 
to 
see 

progress. 

Regarding the University’s 

2016 
enrollment, 
Fitzgerald 

noted first generation students 
made up 14 percent of the 
freshman class, up from 8.5 
percent in 2015. The percent 
of Pell Grant-eligible students 
was 17 percent in 2016, up from 
15 percent, and it has been on 
the rise in recent years. He 
added that the transfer student 
enrollees — a group which, he 
said, consists of relatively more 
first generation students, lower 
income students and students of 
underrepresented minorities —

The state’s unique health care plan relies on funding from the national program

With both the United States’ 

House of Representatives and 
Senate voting to approve budget 
resolutions last week in the first 
step toward repealing President 
Barack 
Obama’s 
health 
care 

law, the future of health care — 
particularly Michigan’s unique 
Healthy Michigan Medicaid Plan 
— is uncertain.

The Healthy Michigan Plan 

made available in 2014 uses 

funding 
through 
the 
health 

care law or “Obamacare,” as it is 
commonly referred to, to expand 
Medicaid coverage to adults with 
incomes at 133 percent of the 
federal poverty level, or about 
$16,000 per year.

A 
recent 
study 
conducted 

by University of Michigan lead 
researchers John Ayanian and 
health economist Helen Levy 
concluded Michigan’s Medicaid 
expansion will leave the state 
with more money than it actually 
spends on the program until 2021.

Ayanian, director of the UM 

Institute for Healthcare Policy 
and Innovation, said the goal 
of the study was to evaluate the 
broader economic effect of the 
Healthy Michigan Plan, such 
as additional employment and 
economic activity.

“As of January 2017, the state 

is responsible for covering five 
percent of the health care costs, 
and that will go up to 10 percent 
in 2020,” Ayanian said. “For 2017, 
Michigan is getting about $3.4 
billion in federal funding for the 
Healthy Michigan Plan, so we 
wanted to estimate what effect 

that has on employment, personal 
income and state tax revenues as 
those dollars come in.”

The study concluded that in 

addition to over 600,000 low-
income adult enrollees, 30,000 
new jobs and an additional $2.3 
billion of economic activity will 
be generated in Michigan as a 
result of the plan.

“We found that from 2015 

through 2021 we estimate this 
funding is adding over 30,000 
jobs to the state economy each 
year — about a third of them are in

The University of Michigan 

offers one of the best all-around 

sports experiences in the country, 

with Michigan Stadium, Yost Ice 

Arena and Crisler Center each 

listed in the “Top 100 Stadium 

Experiences of 2016,” according 

to website and magazine 

“Stadium Journey.”

The list, which evaluated the 

fan experience at 761 different 

college and professional sports 

stadiums in the United States, 

listed Michigan Stadium at 

number 16, Yost Ice Arena at 

number 68 and Crisler Arena at 

number 73.

As the largest stadium in 

North America with a capacity 

of 107,601, the experience on a 

Saturday in Ann Arbor at the Big 

House earned high praise from 

the author of the article, Paul 

Swaney.

“With the recent ascendancy 

of the program, this may just be 

the perfect time to see a game 

at Michigan Stadium,” Swaney 

wrote in the description. “The 

Big House and a Michigan 

football game should sit squarely 

on even the shortest list of must 

see venues for any sports fan. The 

grandiosity, history, and pure 

joy of a Saturday in Ann Arbor 

is a must for all avid stadium 

travelers.”

The Wolverines’ chief rivals, 

Ohio State and Michigan State, 

did not fare well on the list and 

only had one entry: Ohio State’s 

Ohio Stadium ranking at number 

35.

The only other stadium in the 

state of Michigan to make the list 

was Comerica Park, home of the 

Detroit Tigers, at number 92. The 

three other major Detroit sports 

stadiums — Joe Louis Arena, Ford 

Field and The Palace of Auburn 

Hills — did not make the list.

According to an email sent by 

Charlie Houlik Wednesday night 

to members of the Sigma Kappa 

sorority living in the chapter 

house, “up to 30 Fraternity guys 

have been hospitalized with the 

Norovirus.” The email stated the 

sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma 

had closed its doors to any 

nonresidents, and encouraged 

members of Sigma Kappa to do 

the same.

There 
were 
reports 
last 

week of a vomit-inducing illness 

originating from an unspecified 

fraternity when several members 

of Mary Markley Residence Hall 

suddenly became sick.

“It started off with one girl, 

because I guess one of the frats 

on campus had it, and then her 

sorority mixed with them on 

Saturday so she got it,” said 

LSA freshman Haya Akbik last 

week. “Then she gave it to her 

roommate, and some girls in 

our hall got it, and last night a 

girl in our hall slept in my room 

because her roommate had it and 

was puking all night, and then 

my friend on the other side of 

Markley has it.”

University 
of 
Michigan 

representatives say they have not 

seen any evidence to substantiate 

the 
email. 
According 
to 

University spokesperson Kim 

Broekhuizen, there have been 

no new cases of gastrointestinal 

illness in the past week.

“I can tell you with 100 

percent certainty that no one 

has been hospitalized,” she said. 

“Typically, it’s my understanding 

that they don’t test to confirm 

norovirus 
unless 
there’s 
a 

significant concentration of an 

outbreak in one single area, and 

we haven’t had that.”

Mary Masson, director of 

institutional 
positioning 
for 

Michigan Medicine (formerly 

known as the University of 

Michigan 
Health 
System), 

confirmed 
Broekhuizen’s 

statement.

Though, a member of Phi 

Kappa Psi fraternity who asked 

to remain anonymous said he 

was diagnosed with norovirus at 

Michigan Medicine.

“It was UMHS, and yeah, 

they said it was the norovirus,” 

he said.

According to the website for 

the Center for Disease Control, 

the most common symptoms of 

norovirus are diarrhea, throwing 

up, nausea and stomach pain, 

while less common symptoms 

are fever, headaches and body 

aches.”

The anonymous member of 

Phi Kappa Psi described similar 

symptoms.

“I was really at the peak of it 

on Friday and Saturday,” he said. 

“It was mostly just throwing up 

and constant nausea along with 

a pretty intense fever. Overall it 

didn’t last more than 30 hours.”

When 
asked 
about 
the 

content of the email sent to 

Sigma Kappa, the anonymous 

fraternity brother could not 

verify its accuracy.

“I know there’s a couple of 

kids within Greek life that have 

it,” he said. “I haven’t heard of 

that many people being affected 

by it but I’d have no way of 

knowing.”

productive start. She also added 
everyone involved is excited to

health care and 85 percent in the 
private sector, so that generates 
additional income and sales tax 
revenue,” Ayanian said.

Ayanian said the Healthy 

Michigan Plan included features 
not part of typical Medicaid 
programs, including the caveat 
that people over the poverty 
level were required to contribute 
two percent of their income 
toward their coverage, as well 
as 
financial 
incentives 
for 

patients to make healthy lifestyle 
changes, such as eliminating 
smoking and changing eating 
habits.

“When 
the 
Michigan 

legislature approved the Healthy 
Michigan plan in the fall of 2013, 
they created certain features 
that are not typically part of 
Medicaid coverage,” Ayanian 
said.

Gov. Rick Snyder dedicated a 

portion of his State of the State 
address on Tuesday to speaking 
about the benefits of Healthy 
Michigan and said he believes 
the plan has been successful in 
providing access to health care 
for many of the Michigan’s most 
impoverished citizens.

“We 
have 
640,000 

Michiganders in this program,” 
Snyder said. “It has provided 
over 2.8 million primary care 
visits, over 400,000 preventative 

care visits and it’s saving us 
money.”

Snyder also said he anticipates 

forthcoming changes to health 
care and would like to see 
Healthy Michigan serve as a 
model policy for the rest of the 
country.

“There’s going to be changes 

in health care,” he said. “The 
important thing is we need to 
let them know that Healthy 
Michigan is a model that can 
work for the rest of the country. 
We look forward to reimagining 
health care for all Michiganders 
and our entire country with 
Michigan being a leader in that 
dialogue.”

President-elect Donald Trump 

ran on a platform of repealing 
and replacing “Obamacare” amid 
problems of nationally rising 
costs in insurance premiums and 
prescription drugs.

Congressional 
Republicans 

have 
yet 
to 
introduce 
a 

comprehensive replacement plan, 
but it is speculated that Rep. Tom 
Price (R–Ga.), Trump’s pick to 
head the Department of Health 
and Human Services, could be 
influential in future health care 
policy decisions.

Price is a notable opponent of 

the Affordable Care Act and as 
a representative, he introduced 
the Empowering Patients First 
Act in 2015 as an alternative 
to “Obamacare.” Under Price’s 
plan, individuals would receive 
age-adjusted tax credits when 
purchasing insurance and the 

plan would allow insurers to 
sell policies across state lines 
in an effort to drive down costs 
by 
making 
insurance 
more 

competitive.

LSA junior Collin Kelly, chair 

of the University’s chapter of 
College Democrats, is a proponent 
of Obama’s health care law and 
said there are benefits for college 
students such as himself being 
able to stay on his parents’ health 
care plan.

“It has so many provisions 

that are so helpful, especially 
for people like me,” Kelly said. 
“Staying on my parent’s insurance 
until I’m 26 is huge; I wouldn’t be 
able to afford it if that wasn’t the 
case.”

In an ideal world, Kelly said he 

would like to see “Obamacare” 
amended and the country move 
toward a single-payer health care 
system, in which the state covers 
health care costs.

“It just gets down to certain 

values you feel, that like people’s 
health should almost be a right 
and shouldn’t be some privilege 
where if you’re born into poverty 
or born in certain communities 
just by chance you can’t take care 
of your health,” Kelly said.

Kelly said he believes the 

Affordable Care Act has been a 
success and he hopes Congress 
will reconsider keeping it in place, 
or at the very least replace it with a 
plan similar to “Obamacare.”

“Hopefully 
there’s 
enough 

pressure on that they keep 
it, because seven years in, it’s 

working and it’s now a part of not 
just our health care system, but 
our economy and government and 
it’s a part of people’s lives,” Kelly 
said. “We can’t just get rid of that 
with no solid replacement.”

Engineering freshman Lincoln 

Merill, publicity chair of College 
Republicans, said in an email 
interview with the Daily he 
believes the Affordable Care Act 
should be repealed and replaced 
with a better system.

“It needs to be repealed, but 

at the same time it also needs to 
be replaced with an improved 
healthcare system that allows 
greater competition and therefore 
drives down prices for everyone,” 
Merrill wrote.

According to Merrill, the faults 

of the health care act as it stands 
is the lack of competition within 
the health insurance industry. 

“Some companies didn’t want 

to have to cover some people 
and so they dropped out of the 
program altogether. Because there 
are so few companies left, prices 
are rising at alarming rates due 
to the low competition - as high 
as over 100 percent in Arizona,” 
Merrill wrote. “These high costs 
and high deductibles, coupled 
with the lie of ‘if you like your 
doctor, you can keep your doctor,’ 
which is false because so many 
companies won’t insure people, 
created a healthcare system 
with a good intention, that is 
providing health insurance for 
everyone, but critically flawed 
in execution.”

“The hope there is that friends 

of these students or other members 
of the organizations that these 
students are in will nominate them 
and be able to speak to the way that 
their leadership has impacted this 
climate in a positive way,” Shea said.

Chosen students are highlighted 

in a Facebook post on the CSG page 
featuring a photo along with a bio of 
their accomplishments. 

Shea also noted the survey was 

publicized through social media 
when the idea for “200 for 200” first 
came out, and nominations are still 
being accepted.

According 
to 
Cahen, 
the 

Bicentennial Planning Commission 
reviews the survey entries and 
nominees will be selected every 
Monday and Friday. He said the 
commission tries to choose student 
leaders who do not always get 
recognized for their actions.

“We’re 
looking 
for 
people 

who are involved in essentially 
a variety of communities on 
campus and show dedication to 
both the University and affiliate 
communities but may not always 
have the recognition that they 
deserve,” Cahen said.

LSA senior Alexjandria Edwards 

was one of the first five students 
featured in the “200 for 200” photo 
series and has been involved in a 
wide variety of organizations on 
campus.

“During 

her 
time 
on 
campus, 
U-M 

has emerged as a vanguard 
institution, leading the country 
with a visible and significant 
commitment to comprehensive 
approach to sexual misconduct 
prevention and response. We 
are deeply grateful for her many 
contributions and we wish her 
well with this new opportunity.”

In 
an 
email 
to 
SAPAC 

employees, 
Rider-Milkovich 

wrote she will begin her new 
role 
as 
the 
Senior 
Director 

of 
Prevention 
for 
EverFi, 

an 
educational 
technology 

innovator that works to empower 
students and adult learners with 
experience that will aid them in 
attaining success, on Feb. 5.

At EverFi, she plans to launch 

the Campus Prevention Network, 
a nationwide initiative to join 
institutions that have expressed 
their 
high-level 
commitments 

to preventing health and safety 
issues on their campuses.

Rider-Milkovich 
wrote 
in 

the email she plans to take the 
skills she developed at SAPAC 
and use them to communicate 
the importance of sexual assault 
prevention to a wider audience.

“My job now will be to take 

the lessons we have learned 
together and scale them up to 
the widest possible platform so 
that students at schools that don’t 
have the capacity or resources 
of a SAPAC (or U-M) might still 

benefit from the most effective 
prevention work in the field,” 
Rider-Milkovich 
wrote. 
“This 

decision has been one of the most 
difficult of my career; it is tough 
to leave a job you know and love 
for one with great promise and a 
lot of unknowns.”

LSA senior Elizabeth Nesbitt, 

who serves as a SAPAC event 
coordinator, said she is confident 
Rider-Milkovich will continue to 
succeed in her new position. She 
also added SAPAC will continue 
to serve the student body as they 
transition to new leadership.

“I am so grateful to Holly for 

her work for SAPAC during her 
time as Director,” Nesbitt said. 
“Although it is sad to see her go, 
I know she’ll be doing wonderful 
work 
in 
her 
next 
position. 

SAPAC will continue to serve 
the University as it has and I’m 
excited to see where it heads with 
a new director.”

Rider-Milkovich 
noted 

SAPAC’s services will continue 
uninterrupted, even through the 
careful process of hiring a new 
Director.

“Vice President Harper is 

carefully considering how to 
implement the best leadership 
support 
for 
SAPAC, 
in 

consultation with me and the 
rest of the professional staff, 
while a new Director is being 
hired,” Rider-Milkovich wrote. 
“Rest 
assured 
that 
student 

voices will play an important 
role in the hiring processes. 
Also, please know that your 
groups, 
our 
programs, 
and 

SAPAC’s services to survivors 
will continue forward without 
disruption.”

has increased.

“Even though the freshman 

class is just one snapshot, one 
class, all of those (efforts) are 
moving in the right direction,” 
he said. “It’s an indication that 
we’re working on this; we’re 
making some progress, and this 
will take some time.”

In October, the University 

announced 
a 
five-year 
DEI 

plan. The plan, spearheaded 
by University President Mark 
Schlissel, offers a series of 
initiatives 
to 
improve 
the 

campus’ 
overall 
climate 
by 

encouraging the recognition and 
inclusion of students from all 
backgrounds.

Fitzgerald 
also 
mentioned 

the HAIL Scholarship Program 
— a DEI program that aims 
to reach students from low-
income families in Michigan — 
welcomed 262 recipients as of 
October.

The 
effort 
is 
still 
being 

evaluated 
for 
future 

improvements, but according to 
Fitzgerald, has been successful 
so far.

“HAIL 
is 
not 
only 
a 

scholarship program aimed at 
low-income, 
high-achieving 

students, but also a test of a new 
way of communicating with 
those students and trying to 
reduce some of those barriers 
that we know exist for lower-
income students to apply to 
a place like the University of 
Michigan,” he said.

In an interview with the 

Daily 
in 
November, 
Kedra 

Ishop, the vice provost for 
enrollment management, said 
the program is a direct effort to 
expand economic diversity at the 
University.

“The HAIL scholarship is a 

terrific example of our deliberate 
efforts to bring in people from 
different backgrounds and of 
our efforts to inform prospective 
applicants 
that 
a 
Michigan 

education can be affordable,” 
Ishop said. “And this wasn’t 
necessarily 
a 
policy-driven 

change, but more of a shift 
in messaging. We want high-
achieving students to know that 
you should still apply even if 
you are unsure of how to pay for 
college because cost should not 
be a factor. The University can 
help (your needs).”

LSA senior Sean Javares-

Dajour Smith, who identifies 
with a lower SES, said he does 
not think the University is 
integrated in regard to different 
SES. He said he thinks the 
University “compensate(s)” for 
admitting students from a lower 
SES by admitting students from 

out-of-state who will pay full 
tuition.

“There 
are 
still 
students 

coming from out-of-state, from 
that higher SES,” he said. “(The 
University is) doing that to make 
up the difference with the state 
giving less funding. There’s been 
budget cuts.”

The University faced a 21.6 

percent funding cut from the 
state in 2011. In 2015, University 
officials cited an increase in 
tuition dollars to make up for 
the decrease in funding. Though 

they did not cite an increase in 
out-of-state enrollment, these 
numbers also continue to rise. 
Meanwhile, state funding has 
recently begun to approach pre-
2011 levels.

Smith 
understands 
why 

more 
out-of-state 
students 

are being accepted given the 
circumstances, but said students 
from a lower SES are being 
neglected. 

“They might have a focus on 

us, but at the same time, I think 
that they’re targeting out-of-
state students,” he said. “They’re 
giving them priority. As a result 
of that, you’ve got students from 
inner cities, urbanized suburbs 
and rural areas who kind of get 
left out of the picture.”

Another program aimed at 

improving economic diversity on 
campus, Wolverine Pathways, 
seeks to be a more long-term 
initiative, in which middle-
school 
and 
high-school 

students from nearby areas like 
Ypsilanti and Southfield will 
have the chance to earn a full 
scholarship to the University. 
Through the program, students 
will work with tutors and other 
mentors who will help prepare 
them to apply to the University.

The University is also a 

founder of the American Talent 
Initiative, which launched in 
the fall and aims to increase the 
number of low-income students 
attending 
top 
American 

universities.

Fitzgerald also noted the net 

price of attending the University 
— the cost of attendance minus 
financial aid — is lower than 
the 
national 
average, 
and 

significantly lower than some of 
the University’s competitors such 
as Michigan State University, 
in-state, 
and 
Northwestern 

University, out-of-state.

Additionally, Fitzgerald also 

said, referencing The Upshot 
report, a University of Michigan 

education often leads to a higher-
paying job.

According 
to 
the 
report, 

Michigan came in third out of 25 
highly selective public colleges, 
with a median student income of 
$68,700 at age 34.

“That 
underscores 
what 

some other reports, including 
the Department of Education’s 
college scorecard, said about 
being a good value, a good 
investment, because it pays off,” 
Fitzgerald said. “The median 
salary for our graduates following 
graduation, some reports show as 
much as $25,000 higher than the 
national average.”

In general, Fitzgerald said, 

the University is moving toward 
improvement.

“Even with all of those things 

that we know are not where we 
want to be with socioeconomic 
diversity … that is a component 
of the DEI strategic plan, and 
all kinds of diversity,” he said, 
“including 
socioeconomic 

diversity, is something that we’ll 
continue to work on.”

From a student perspective, 

Smith thinks the best tactic 
may be to increase enrollment 
of students from lower-income 
families 
and 
having 
these 

students be ambassadors.

“If 
they 
gave 
us 
more 

opportunity, we’ll spark their 
imagination and the perception 
of U of M being inacceptable to 
low income students — maybe 
we’ll be able to dispel that myth, 
maybe we’ll be able to break that 
down,” he said. “I think their 
greatest asset and 
outreach 

program is to let more of us in. 
We’re the greatest ambassadors 
they could have.”

Smith explained he was 

surprised to have received 
the amount of financial aid 
that he did, and that students 
from a lower SES may not be 
aware of the opportunities the 
University offers.

I 

am pretty good at keeping 
my personal information 
private, so I tend not to 

think of my banking 
app as part of my 
online 
presence. 

Still, 
it 
somehow 

found a way to fit into 
how I present myself 
online. Namely, when 
I log in to my banking 
app, it prompts me 
with a phrase and 
image that I can 
confirm are indeed 
associated 
with 

my account — an 
account I made at age 16 and 
have not altered since. 

The image and phrase I 

chose, while holding my first 
paycheck and full of youthful 
ignorance, 
have 
shown 

themselves over time to be 
essentially gross lies. In the 
interest of protecting my bank 
account, I’ll give only a rough 
explanation: the image is like 
a gold medal and the phrase is 
along the lines of “I am a huge 
success.”

Every time I log in now, I 

laugh a little for a few reasons: 
A) I have a warped sense 
of humor that allows me to 
laugh at literally anything, 
B) laughing before I see my 
account balance is a good 
primer for being more positive 
than I should in the face of 
my meager sums and C) my 
16-year-old 
self 
had 
huge 

aspirations for what this new 
bank account meant for me 
and my future. The reality is 
perhaps less envious than what 
I might’ve hoped.

I wish I could go back in 

time to hug my high-school 
self and apologize, but also 
to thank her for believing in 
us so strongly (and perhaps 
irrationally). That kid may 
have been an idiot, but she did 
have chutzpah. 

In a larger sense, the weird 

mismatch between the login 
phrase and my account balance 
demonstrates to me that who 
we are online is often not 
reflective of our reality. Online 
we are given the opportunity 
to reinvent ourselves. We are 
much more prone to sharing 
our successes and good days 
online than posting pictures of 
ourselves splattered with soup 
after we’ve tripped down some 

stairs. (In general. Just as an 
example. That hasn’t happened 
to me.)

In a way, I can 

guarantee that we’ve 
all been dishonest 
online (some of us 
more than others). 
I don’t necessarily 
mean claiming on 
Facebook 
that 
“I 

have 
a 
girlfriend 

in Canada who you 
won’t 
meet 
but 

absolutely 
exists” 

so much as giving 
off a vibe of “I 

drink champagne daily” on 
Instagram.

The lying we do through 

self-branding 
and 
omission 

online isn’t a negative thing 
necessarily, or even completely 
avoidable. 
It’s 
simply 
not 

possible to accurately represent 
who we are in all our wonderful 
complexities on social media.

Furthermore, 
we 
are 

prone to censoring ourselves 
when faced with a platform’s 
shortcomings and unspoken 
rules, such as limiting our 
cursing if family is going to 
see a post or censoring our 
conspiracy theories in case a 
future employer goes snooping 
(despite the powerful impulse 
to 
convince 
everyone 
that 

Jupiter isn’t real; we’ve all 
been there).

In fact, these positive lies 

can be seen as aspirational; 
these posts may not represent 
our true selves, but it’s how we 
might like to be seen or how 
we wish we lived and felt all 
the time. I may post concert 
videos and flattering selfies 
on Instagram, but that’s not 
my day-to-day life. My online 
presence is more of a highlight 
reel, leaving out the less than 
stellar 
moments, 
like 
last 

week when I accidentally fell 
asleep on top of a fun size Mr. 
Goodbar and woke up with 
melted chocolate everywhere.

There are legitimate reasons 

I don’t share everything, from 
a desire for privacy to not 
feeling the need to document 
the mundanity of my everyday 
life. More often, though, it 
comes down to wanting a 
positive response from others. 
I can rephrase my thoughts 
to come across as particularly 
eloquent or impactful, and I 

can cherry pick the moments 
that I share, making public 
only as much as I want others 
to see. Our online revisions can 
be powerful things that let us 
display a filtered version of the 
best parts of ourselves.

That being said, dishonesty 

is dishonesty, and it can have 
side effects on our happiness 
and self-worth. Studies show 
that while seeing positive posts 
online can influence us to 
think positively as well, seeing 
nothing but positive posts from 
others can lead us to negatively 
compare ourselves and our 
lives to the stories that others 
are sharing about themselves 
and their own lives.

Knowing this, I’d like to 

challenge all of us, myself 
included, to live more honestly 
by documenting our failures. 
While I might happily post 
on Facebook about a new 
job, I can also push myself to 
acknowledge the handfuls of 
interviews that didn’t pan out 
before it. Or while I might post 
a picture on Instagram with 
my crew on a night out, I can 
also share a video of myself 
pawing through my clothes 
pile (closets are for quitters) to 
find something clean to wear 
and then crying over how bad 
I am at makeup. Now That’s 
What I Call Honesty! 

Maybe 
by 
not 
only 

documenting my aspirational, 
ideal 
self, 
but 
also 
my 

awkward, 
not-yet-successful 

self, I can create a digital 
archive of honest self-growth 
over the years, as well as a 
more realistic representation 
of myself online. If others are 
going to compare themselves 
to me, they might as well be 
doing it with something closer 
to the real thing.

I might even make others 

feel better about their lives in 
comparison when they see a 
photo of me with soup spilled 
all over my jeans! (Again, just 
an example. Not a thing I’ve 
done recently.) Perhaps in 
trying this small extra layer 
of online honesty, I’ll one day 
merit that gold medal that my 
16-year-old self felt I deserved. 
Maybe I’ll even earn the 
phrase, “I am a huge success.”

Deer overpopulation poses 

unique threats to Ann Arbor’s 
residents 
and 
environment. 

Many 
city 
residents 
have 

incurred substantial property 
damage, experienced aggression 
from deer and reported vehicle 
near-misses and collisions from 
rapid deer overpopulation. By 
removing the deer’s natural 
predators, 
like 
wolves 
and 

bears, 
deer 
populations 
go 

unchecked, wreaking havoc on 
the city’s natural biodiversity. 
Overpopulation 
of 
deer 

poses threats to Ann Arbor’s 
ecosystem, because they prey 
on native plants, eliminating 
habitats and food sources for 
other animals.

New efforts for this year 

are more conscious of citizens’ 
ethical concerns about last year’s 
deer removal tactics. What’s 
more, the city has instituted 
safer, more humane methods 
of curbing Ann Arbor’s deer 
population. This year’s cull will 
include non-lethal sterilization, 
a 
noteworthy 
attempt 
to 

compromise with constituents’ 
concerns. 
Research 
has 

shown ovarectomies — surgical 
procedures that remove the 
ovaries completely — to be the 
most effective, least invasive and 
quickest method for destroying 
a deer population’s reproductive 
capabilities. Furthermore, the 
city will track migration patterns 
and survival rates of the deer 

sterilized in this cull so more 
ethical culling methods may be 
implemented in the future.

Furthermore, 
Ann 
Arbor 

City Council addressed issues of 
public safety in considering the 
parameters of this year’s cull. 
The upcoming cull will take 
place in fewer, more distinct 
places and away from areas of 
traffic like children’s routes to 
school, which was a concern for 
some constituents last year.

Additionally, parts of this 

year’s cull will be conducted on 
University property, a necessity 
given 
the 
way 
University 

property is integrated into the 
framework of the city. Without 
access to certain campus areas, 
the cull would not be as effective. 
The University is also being 
cautious in opening its land in 
order to protect the student 
body; the cull on North Campus, 

for example, will take place over 
Spring Break when there is less 
student traffic.

The University will contribute 

15 percent of the total cost of 
the cull, proportional to the 
area of property the University 
owns in Wards 1 and 2. The 
total expenses will not exceed 
$25,000. While it may be argued 
these funds should be used 
for services that help students 
more directly, the University’s 
involvement 
in 
the 
culling 

measures can help prevent deer 
overpopulation from becoming a 
problem in neighborhoods where 
students live, such as South 
Campus. In 2015, students made 
up about 37 percent of the city’s 
population. 
Considering 
the 

University’s contribution to the 
city’s population, this 15 percent 
“service 
fee” 
is 
negligible, 

especially as the University is 
exempt from paying property 
taxes.

The deer cull will greatly 

benefit the entire Ann Arbor 
community, 
including 
the 

University 
community, 
by 

reducing 
additional 
damage 

to local ecology and personal 
property. 
While 
killing 
and 

sterilizing deer is certainly not 
ideal, it is a necessary measure 
of population control that has 
been carefully planned out to 
ensure the safety of our residents 
and the efficacy and ethics of 
maintaining our environment.

RNA can revolutionize medicine

CENTER FOR RNA BIOMEDICINE | OP-ED

A 

half-century 
ago, 

James 
Watson 
and 

Francis Crick became 

renowned 
for 
revealing 

the double helix structure 
of 
DNA, 
the 
molecule 
in 

each 
cell 
that 
provides 

the “blueprint” for human 
beings. 
This 
breakthrough 

laid 
the 
foundation 
for 

our understanding of how 
information is transferred in 
biology.

Arguably one of the most 

profound scientific discoveries 
of the 20th century — solving 
the DNA structure — required 
the collaboration of scientists 
from 
the 
physical 
and 

biological sciences.

Now, 
a 
collaboration 
at 

the University of Michigan 
has set out to bring insights 
from the molecular realm of 
RNA to bedside medicine. 
Rapidly 
emerging 
insights 

into how RNA, DNA’s close 
chemical cousin, helps modify, 
safeguard 
and 
translate 

genetic information in each 
of us is offering the promise 
of a personalized “precision 
medicine.”

Most 
current 
medical 

treatments 
are 
one-size-

fits-all, an approach that is 
successful for some patients 
but 
not 
others. 
Precision 

medicine is a modern approach 
to 
disease 
prevention 
and 

treatment 
that 
takes 
into 

account individuality, which is 
shaped by genetic inheritance, 
environment 
and 
lifestyle. 

While 
DNA 
provides 
the 

genetic code for a human life, it 
is RNA that determines which 
parts of the code are used and 
when. Over the lifespan of a 
human being, the parts of the 
DNA blueprint that are read 

out by RNA constantly change, 
leading to aging and disease.

Current discoveries in RNA 

biomedicine are paving the 
way for diagnostics that can 
detect problems early and 
therapies that fix problems 
at their roots, rather than 
simply 
treating 
symptoms. 

The premise of RNA-focused 
precision medicine is that 
human 
diseases, 
such 
as 

cancer and Alzheimer’s, could 
be cured with less invasive, 
more 
targeted 
treatments 

with minimized side effects, 
tailored to each of us based on 
our RNA makeup.

In 
genetic 
diseases, 

segments 
of 
the 
human 

genome are reorganized in 
ways that can derail normal 
function. A notable example 
of RNA in precision medicine 
is the recently FDA-approved 
treatment for spinal muscular 
atrophy, 
a 
neuromuscular 

disease that is the leading 
genetic cause of death in 
infants. 
A 
research 
group 

led by Prof. Adrian Krainer 
at the Cold Spring Harbor 
Laboratory in New York — 
incidentally, 
where 
Watson 

went on to serve as director 
and president — collaborated 
to study RNA splicing defects, 
or 
errors 
in 
editing 
the 

RNA sequences. The team 
was 
able 
to 
successfully 

correct a splicing defect that 
caused SMA by using the 
revolutionary 
therapeutic 

approach of injection of a 
stretch of modified RNA that 
corrected the defect, allowing 
the cells to make a protein 
necessary to keeping muscle 
nerve cells functioning. This 
groundbreaking therapy can 
save lives.

In the spirit of collaboration 

across 
the 
physical 
and 

biological sciences, University 
President Mark Schlissel has

Deer cull is a necessary cost 
L

ast November, the University of Michigan announced it would 
participate in Ann Arbor’s deer cull efforts, a program first 
approved by Ann Arbor City Council by an 8-1 vote in August 

2015. From Jan. 30 to Feb. 13, the city of Ann Arbor will begin the 
second iteration of the program, which will include a non-lethal method 
of sterilization in addition to the lethal methods used in last year’s cull 
to help control the city’s growing deer population. The University has 
authorized the cull to take place at certain campus locations, such as 
Nichols Arboretum and possibly on North Campus, and will contribute 
15 percent of the total cost of the cull. Though controversial, the newest 
plan for the deer cull is a necessary and efficient response to deer 
overpopulation. The Michigan Daily’s Editorial Board supports both 
the deer cull and the University’s land and fiscal contributions to it.

The deer cull will 

greatly benefit 
the entire Ann 

Arbor community, 

including the 

University 
community.

The Flaming Lips’ new
album inventive, dreamy 
 

While the band’s latest offering is uneven relative to past releases, 
the psychedelic project shows a group still grounded in innovation

If 
nothing 
else, 
The 

Flaming Lips are known for 
their experimental ventures 
into the world of psychedelic 
rock. Some of these leaps have 
turned out extremely well in 
the past, while 
others 
have 

misfired 
and 

rocketed 
into 

more confusing 
territory. Given 
the 
range 

of 
quality 
— 

especially their more recent 
output — I wasn’t entirely 
sure what to expect from 
Oczy Mlody, which details 
a 
primarily 
drug-oriented 

journey through the mind. My 
doubt did resurface a couple of 
times throughout the album, 
but overall I was pleasantly 
surprised by The Flaming 
Lips’ sonic explorations and 
their ability to keep diving 
into new musical territory, 
even after over 30 years of 
experimentation.

The 
album 
opens 
with 

the titular “Oczy Mlody,” a 
rhythmic instrumental track 
that lets the listener know 
what tone to expect from the 
album: dreamy with a bit of 
an edge, a musical feeling 
that seeks — and finds — a 
balance between repetition 
and freshness. The Flaming 
Lips use this song to launch 
themselves into a 12-track 
evaluation 
of 
the 
many 

emotional and mental subtexts 
of love, drugs and violence. The 
first few songs are lyrically 
intriguing 
because 
they 

introduce some of the most 
central preoccupations of the 
album — the violent confusion 
of 
“How??,” 
the 
troubled 

idealism of “There Should 
Be Unicorns,” the despairing 
frustrations of “Sunrise (Eyes 
of the Young).” These songs 
are pensive and colorful, and 
they are tied together by their 
strange 
representations 
of 

balance between the clear and 
the cloudy, the real and the 
imagined.

It is not until a few songs 

into the album, 
however, 
that 

things 
begin 

to 
get 
more 

interesting. The 
catchy 
near-

instrumental 
“Nigdy 
Nie 

(Never No)” maintains the 
rhythmic feeling of the songs 
before it, while introducing 
a 
little 
more 
edge 
and 

inventiveness in terms of the 
relationships 
between 
its 

instruments 
— 
sometimes 

harsh and fuzzy, sometimes 
fresh and clear, always quick 
and insistent — and its sparse, 
almost choral vocals. “Galaxy 
I Sink” and “Listening to 
the Frogs with Demon Eyes” 
both embody the interesting 
dichotomy 
between 
vivid 

clarity and lost abstraction and 
fear that is presented by drug 
use and love alike. “Galaxy 
I Sink” effectively employs 
many different instruments 
and sounds — from the hard 
plucking of a guitar to the 
anxious surge of violins to 
an undertone of what sound 
like crickets, and “Listening 
to the Frogs with Demon 
Eyes” brings the cricket-like 
noises back, along with the 
croaking of frogs. “One Night 
While Hunting for Faeries and 
Witches and Wizards to Kill,” 
a psychedelic journey through 
some fairyland, is to me the 
most lyrically impressive song 
of the whole album, detailing 
a strange story of violence 

met with healing, of confusion 
met with clarity and leading 
toward love.

Almost all of these songs 

explore 
the 
relationship 

between — and at times union 
of — clarity and confusion, 
trust and distrust. “Almost 
Home (Blisko Domu)” recedes 
from the album’s earlier strains 
of fantasy with philosophical 
questioning, expressions of 
uncertainty, and disillusioned 
recollections of “my fragile 
dream / of how the world is 
full of love.” Then comes the 
closing track, the single “We a 
Famly.” Miley Cyrus emerges 
as the voice of the beloved 
figure often addressed and 
alluded to throughout the 
album, and finally responds to 
all of the album’s troubled-yet-
hopeful uncertainties about 
love and life, affirming, “It’s 
you and me, we a family.” This 
song represents a definitive 
decision on the part of The 
Flaming Lips to end this 
album, for all its doubts and 
anxieties, on a note of hope, 
faith, and togetherness. Brief 
laughter comes after the final 
proclamation of “We a family,” 
closing out the song, and with 
it, the album.

Oczy Mlody does see a 

few low points – some of its 
earlier songs blend together 
musically, and the lyrics of, 
for 
instance, 
“Do 
Glowy,” 

are nothing to drop one’s 
jaw at. However, it comes 
together for a well-conveyed 
message about the merits of 
existential inquiry, about love 
in the face of confusion and 
darkness. Dreamy, fantastical 
and musically inventive, it is 
a drug trip, a love story and, 
above all else, a verification 
that The Flaming Lips still 
have something to offer the 
world of psychedelic rock.

BELLA UNION

NY rap makes a comeback

It’s been a minute since a New 

Yorker reigned as the hottest 
rapper. Without counting Jay-Z’s 
post-retirement victory laps, it’s 
probably been more than a decade. 
The Big Apple, the birthplace of 
hip-hop, was long-considered rap’s 
pinnacle city. But in the early 2000s, 
once 50 Cent’s debut album, Get 
Rich Or Die Tryin’, cooled off, so did 
the mainstream attraction to New 
York’s gritty, street-core lyricism. 
By then, other major metropoles — 
namely, Atlanta, Los Angeles and 
Chicago — had already established 
their own musical movements, ones 
that were inspired by alternative, 
perhaps 
more 
progressive, 

creative energies and have largely 
dominated the rap charts since.

Today, 
among 
post-lyrical 

mumblers like Young Thug and 
Future, or even the soulful smooth-
talkers such as Chance the Rapper 
and Anderson .Paak, a lot of the 
always-on-beat rhymers that have 
historically been deemed top-notch 
can seem strikingly out of place. 
It’s hard to imagine Fabolous, or 
Jadakiss, or Cam’ron, or even Nas 
earning a number one rap song in 
2017 — not because they’ve lost their 
technical abilities (note: they have 
NOT!), but because of ideological 
static that exists between them and 
the culture’s youngsters.

Today’s kids have spent their 

entire lives having a hip-hop 
hierarchy passed down to them 
by threatened adults who often 
conclude by saying that kids will 
just never understand. So those 
same kids went out and built 
something new, something that’s 
entirely their own, something that 
they can definitely understand. 
They launched a sort of rainbow 
revolution that aims not just to 
adjust, but to entirely rebuild hip-
hop’s foundation by establishing a 
new culture of acceptance within 
the genre. Less fazed by the gun 
talk and bullyish aggression of 
earlier eras, modern fans are most 
effectively drawn to artists that 
oppose 
convention. 
Successful 

boasts no longer broadcast body 
counts 
and 
bank 
receipts; 

instead, they brag about social 
media followers. Like Quavo 
from Migos said: “They bustin’ 
for Instagram / Get your clout 
up.”

Alas, there is now a new 

movement at-large, one led 
by traditionalist gatekeepers 
(such as the once-influential 
radio DJ Funkmaster Flex) in 
vocal opposition to the mere 
existence of young, cartoonish, 
somewhat controversial hip-hop 
stars (think Lil Yachty and Lil Uzi 
Vert). While the ethical feud has 
already produced tangible results 
(lest we ever forget that mash-
up .gif of Funk Flex screaming 
“Motherf*cking baaaars!!” after Lil 
Uzi Vert moans, “Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! 
Yeah!” on “Bad and Boujee”), it has 
also catalyzed larger conversations 
within hip-hop and revitalized an 
ongoing search for New York’s next 
prophetic rap star.

Perhaps hip-hop’s changing of 

the guards was inevitable, a natural 
result of the genre’s spreading 
across the country, the world and, 
most recently, multiple generations. 
But try breaking that logic down 
to a purebred New Yorker donning 
Timberland boots and rapping 
every word of Nas’s Illmatic. Let 
me know how that goes for you 
(warning: it won’t go well). So, in 
2017, I am betting on the Big Apple 
to strike back and properly reassert 
its vitality. There is a whole wave of 
fresh, young talent coming out of 
the five boroughs. You better expect 
these artists to come out shooting.

Dave East
Dave East is the oldest, most 

traditional and, well, least new of 
these newcomers. But he’s been 
inching towards the spotlight for 
a few years and, having recently 
been named a member of XXL 
Magazine’s 
current 
freshman 

class, is sure to continue garnering 
attention 
in 
2017. 
Stemming 

from Harlem, East blew up after 
self-releasing his “Black Rose” 
mixtape in 2014, a project that 
proved his technical skills to be 
absolutely superior to his peers’, 
and eventually earned the attention 
of hip-hop legend Nas, who went on 
to sign the emcee to his label, Mass 
Appeal Records.

East 
released 
his 
first 

commercial project, Hate Me Now, 
in 2015, and though it demonstrated 
both his willingness to evolve into a 
wholistic songwriter and his ability 
to hold his own bar for bar with 
established veterans like Jadakiss, 
Pusha T and Styles P, it still left 
some emotional layers untapped; 
there was room for the rapper to go 
deeper. Thankfully so, because in 
September of 2016, East released his 
second project with Mass Appeal, 
Kairi Chanel, and while its songs 
maintain the gritty, or graphic, or 
even intimidating tone of his earlier 
work, they’re equally defined by the 
artist’s heart and self-awareness.

Kairi Chanel is an almost perfect 

rap album: The skits are cinematic, 
vividly 
capturing 
disconnected 

conversations 
in 
a 
way 
that 

transplants listeners straight to 
the sidewalks of Harlem, and its 
songs are finer tuned than any of 
Dave East’s earlier work. “Keisha” 
is a wildly impressive street 
parable reminiscent of Biggie’s “I 
Got A Story To Tell”; “From the 
Heart” offers a fresh take on a 
classic format: rapping to a friend 
who’s incarcerated; “Don Pablo” is 
evidence of how organically East 
can find infinite rhymes in a single 
syllable; “Don’t Shoot” might be 
the most chilling commentary on 
police brutality to date. Dave East 
raps with the street knowledge 
of an industry legend in an era 
that probably won’t pay him the 
attention he deserves. If that 
sounds dope to you, it’s time to start 
listening.

A. Boogie Wit Da Hoodie
I swear, gun to my head, I still 

can’t pick my favorite A. Boogie 
harmony. So, to speed things up, 
I’ve settled on two: First is the 
deep-cutting, 
“I’m 
done 
with 

these Balenciagas, they keep on 
fucking my socks up / Nothing but 
foreigns behind us, we used to pull 
up in that Honda,” which appears 
on his prophetic single, “Not A 
Regular Person,” chronicling his 
evolution from aspirational Bronx 
kid to rookie rap star. But then, how 
could I not also mention the perfect 
bridge on “Jungle,” which made 
me comfortable with his singsongy 
rap style in the first place? “I was 
walking in the rain with my Timbs 
on, stepping over puddles full of 
pain / It’s a big storm, 13 on my 
Balmains / It’s a big storm, in the 
club, love to make it rain.” Those are 
some of the most quintessentially 
New York lyrics ever written, even 
with A. Boogie’s unwillingness to 
disguise his major “feels.”

Born Artist Dubose and raised 

in the Highbridge neighborhood 
of the Bronx, New York, A. Boogie 
released 
his 
debut 
mixtape, 

Artist, on Valentine’s Day last 
year, and after “My Shit,” one of 
its featured tracks, turned into an 
essential summer hit, he found 
himself opening for Drake and 
Future’s Summer Sixteen Tour 
at Madison Square Garden. 
Since then, he has self-released 
a commercial EP, “TBA (The 
Bigger 
Artist),” 
to 
prolong 

his residency on New York 
radio. The five-song project 
is filled with hits: “Timeless 
(feat. DJ SPINGKING)” is a club-
ready anthem that inherits its vibe 
from Island dancehall music; “99 
Problems & Messages” is a boastful 
romance rap that pays discrete 
homage to tracks by Jay-Z and 50 
Cent; “Baecation” is a singsong one 
for the lady fans.

Boogie harmonizes like most 

other post-Drake aspirers, but 
writes lyrics that feel more directly 
informed by those of the great 
horror-rap era wordsmiths. Even 
as a rookie, he’s proven himself 
capable of establishing a unique, 
recognizable sound that caters 
to a wide audience. He can be a 
braggadocious gangster or even 
threatening, but more often he is 
emotional, musical and publicly 
romantic. That’s the kind of balance 
needed to succeed in 2017, so 
I’m betting on A. Boogie. A lot of 
listeners already have.

Don Q
Don Q first emerged rapping 

aside A. Boogie on their crew 
mixtape, Highbridge the Label: the 
Takeover Vol. 1, counteracting his 
cohort’s more melodic moments 
with slick, piercing verses that add 
extra street credibility to proven 
hits “Bag on Me” and “Bando.” He 
already has the nasal twang of a 
seasoned emcee (think Jim Jones 
yelling out, “Haaarh-luhm”) and 
on his debut solo project, “Don 

Season,” which released in July 
and is hosted by Don Cannon, he 
explores a diverse set of musical 
spaces, effortlessly proving himself 
capable of creating within each one. 
Don Q told REVOLT that he’s a fan 
of Jay-Z, particularly “the way he 
puts words together and flows,” 
but he also “fell in love with the 
punchlines” by listening to Cassidy, 
Loyd Banks and Fabolous.

“Don 
Season” 
is 
packed 

beginning to end with straight 
bars — there’s no other way to say 
it. “By Accident” is a fully-equipped 
street banger reminiscent of old 
Dipset tracks and some Meek Mill 
heaters; “Look At Me Now” plays 
something like an unforgiving 
memoir; “In Love With The Music” 
and 
“Everyday” 
demonstrate 

Don’s range and musical ambition; 
“Everything Lit” is a firm reminder 
that his lyrical acrobatics alone are 
enough to carry a song. Be sure to 
watch out for Don Q in the new year 
and expect him to keep bullying 
his generation with hard-hitting 
verses. The entire Highbridge Label 
just might turn into the next big 
movement.

Young M.A
You know Young M.A. You may 

not know that you know Young 
M.A, but you know Young M.A. 
You’ve heard her breakout hit — 
“Oou” — at least a dozen times this 
year, maybe a hundred if you’re in 
a committed hip-hop circle, and 
you’ve seen her perfectly meme-
able lyric — “Like I ain’t got a hitter 
to the left of me” — on countless 
internet timelines, unprecedentedly 
accompanying your friends’ non-
gangster Instagram posts. You’ve 
also seen Young M.A, whether 
you’ve realized it or not, in the 
Beats By Dre commercial (“I’ve Got 
No Strings”) that has, like, every 
celebrity ever (Pharrell, Travis 
Scott, DJ Khaled, Amber Rose, 
Nicki Minaj and more) parading 
around 
in 
pastel 
headphones. 

During her spot, the Brooklyn-
raised 
spitter 
is 
appropriately 

shown 
strolling 
through 
an 

alleyway, staring back at a woman 
that’s just passed and broadcasting 
her approval with a staple moan — 
“Oooou!” — that is among the elite 
few audio tracks allowed into the 
grandiose commercial.

Young M.A first blew up in 2014 

after her barrel-emptying verse 
on posse cut “Brooklyn (Chiraq 
Freestyle)” 
proved 
vicious 

enough to tick off of Dr. Boyce 
Watkins, a social commentator 
who struck back against the 
rap 
song 
and 
accidentally 

earned it more attention. Since 
then, 
she’s 
been 
acquiring 

credibility 
mostly 
through 

underground 
mixtapes 
and 

Soundcloud 
freestyles 
that 

reimagine famous rap songs 
into 
more 
street-appropriate 

forms, but in late 2015, the emcee 
commercially released six songs 
from her SleepWalkin mixtape 
as an EP, and ever since “Oou” 
turned her into superstar, those 
tracks have been earning a lot of 
attention. “Hood Love” is proof 
that even gritty gangster rap can 
come in approachable packages; 
“Through the Day” is a chilling 
reflection on the death of her older 
brother and the ways in which 
that motivates her to grind 
harder; “Get This Money” is 
well-equipped to be a radio hit, 
which is probably why it just 
recently got a music video.

Young M.A might be one of 

the coldest female spitters — 
spitter, not artist, not musician, 
rapper, remember those? — 
to ever hold a microphone, 
yet 
she’s 
openly 
expressed 

weariness with working with 
others who might want to box 
her in by emphasizing her 
gender for marketing purposes. 
She turned down an acting spot 
on Fox’s hit television show 
Empire; she’s still weighing 
contracts 
from 
multiple 

records labels and isn’t in any 
rush to sign. “Nobody really 
said anything that we weren’t 
already doing, so I definitely 
gotta big-up my team,” she 
told Elle. In 2016, Young M.A 
received public endorsements 
— either through collaboration 
or vocal praise — from Beyonce, 
Serena Williams, Nicki Minaj, 
50 Cent, The Game, French 
Montana, Meek Mill and more. 
The spotlight is already on her; 
the ball is in her court. You 
better expect Young M.A to 
steal the show this year!

Neil Patrick Harris as Count Olaf.

If you’re seeking a lighthearted 

series to add to your Netflix queue, 
now is the time to turn away. The 
series itself warns viewers to “look 
away, look away, look away” as the 
opening titles for Lemony Snicket’s 
“A Series of Unfor-
tunate Events” play 
across the screen. 
And 
they’re 
not 

wrong in advertising 
the revival as such 
— the series is, after 
all, modeled after 
the very unfortunate 
events of the Baude-
laire children follow-
ing the tragic demise 
of their parents in a 
horrible fire.

“A 
Series 
of 

Unfortunate Events” lives entirely 
in its own little world, free from the 
constraints that a period piece can 
often put on a work of fiction. At any 
given moment, a trolley car could 
pass by on the street or a character 
could abruptly make the switch 
between cell phone and typewriter. 
This decision to keep the series out 
of a set time period is a deliberate 
and risky move, but in keeping with 
the gothic, absurdist fiction of the 
novels on which the series is based 
— it works. Without worrying too 
much about the setting and relative 
era, it makes it easy to focus more 
heavily on the characters as they 
progress from one tragic event to 

the next.

One of the many themes that is 

drawn from “A Series of Unfortu-
nate Events” is its comparison to 
the novels in regards to the close-
mindedness of the adults, who con-
tinuously ignore the children’s keen 
observations. As they are handed 
off from one guardian to the next, 
each of whom is very noticeably 
Count Olaf (Neil Patrick Harris, 

“How I Met Your 
Mother”) in dis-
guise, the adults are 
completely 
oblivi-

ous to the devious 
plot of their sinister 
guardian. Because 
the children are 
looked at as wealthy 
and 
somewhat 

spoiled to the pub-
lic eye, their com-
plaints 
regarding 

the 
labors 
and 

hardships 
they’ve 

endured at the hands of the Count 
and his band of goons often fall on 
deaf ears. This ongoing theme is 
what makes “A Series of Unfortu-
nate Events” unique, as it brings to 
attention the oversight that children 
often face at the hands of the “all-
knowing” adults. It’s a role reversal 
that is revisited time and time again 
throughout the canon and Netflix 
adaptation. The fact that “A Series 
of Unfortunate Events” dismisses 
this long held-belief and places an 
importance on the knowledge of 
children in a way that is often dis-
missed in mainstream media is not 
only unique, but keeps the series 
interesting as well.

On that same note, Neil Patrick 

Harris is spectacularly spooky as 
the sinister Count Olaf, a distant 
relative-turned-actor 
intent 
on 

stealing the Baudelaire’s inherited 
fortune through trickery and devi-
ous plots. At first, it’s difficult to 
dismiss Jim Carrey’s (“The Mask”) 
performance in the 2004 film adap-
tation of the same name in place of 
Harris’ Count Olaf, whose perfor-
mance is slightly softer than Car-
rey’s. However, one soon falls into 
a rhythm with the devious Count, 
who balances out his personality 
with a eccentricity that completes 
the dark humor of the series.

As the episodes progress, Pat-

rick Warburton (“Rules of Engage-
ment”) appears on screen as the 
omnipresent 
narrator 
Lemony 

Snicket, whose sole purpose, it 
would seem, is to remind viewers 
of the dark and dreary situation in 
which the children find themselves. 
Anecdotes are often provided by 
the dreary narrator as he recounts 
the case of the Baudelaire children’s 
misfortunes and points out just how 
unfortunate their situation has truly 
become. The jokes are purposefully 
missing the punchline, as Lemony 
Snicket exists solely to remind us 
of the bad — there isn’t much good 
to begin with in this never-ending 
cloud of terrible, awful events. 
Then again, if you’re looking 
for a happier tale, you’ll prob-
ably be better off watching 
“Fuller House.”

All eight episodes of “A Series 

of Unfortunate Events” are cur-
rently streaming on Netflix.

TV REVIEW
Love for ‘L’amour de loin’

New 
York 
City’s 

Metropolitan 
Opera 
is 
the 

oldest and one of the most 
respected organizationsw of 
music drama in the nation, as 
well as the country’s largest 
classical 
music 
institution. 

Founded in the 1880’s, it can 
trace its history back to the 
Gilded Age of America, when 
its host city was dominated 
by 
men 
with 
names 
like 

Morgan, 
Carnegie 

and 
Rockefeller, 

whose legacies live 
on 
in 
the 
City’s 

famous 
landmarks. 

In 
its 
modern-day 

location 
positioned 

as part of Lincoln 
Center, the Met sits 
just across the street 
from Juilliard, and 
its impressive arched 
façade 
takes 
one’s 

breath away. Inside 
the 
building 
the 

gold 
and 
glittering 

surfaces 
dazzle 
the 
eyes, 

while the opulent red carpets 
muffle your footsteps. The 
chandeliers, which rise to the 
plane of eye-level as you ascend 
to the upper balconies, look 
like mechanical sunbursts. To 
attend a performance in that 
building is an experience like 
no other, and so when I stepped 
off the plane at Laguardia at the 
beginning of Winter Break, the 
Met wasn’t simply something 
I looked forward to seeing — 
it was my entire reason for 
coming.

Earlier this academic year 

I glanced through the Met’s 
season when it was announced, 
expecting to find the usual, 
standard-fare Verdi, Puccini 
and Wagner — the classics, the 
tried-and-true and what have 
you. And I certainly did find 
them, as anticipated, and all of 
those composers are excellent 
at what they do and masters of 
the form, but honestly, they just 
don’t particularly interest me. 
Mostly this has to do with the 
fact that my tastes tend to be 
more modern, or else be even 
older than those three. But 
something else in the season 
was entirely unexpected and 
electrifying. During the month 
of December, the Met would 
be performing “L’amour de 
loin,” an opera composed about 
16 years ago by the Finnish 
composer Kaija Saariaho, who 
— to me at least — is one of the 

most interesting compositional 
voices active today.

Immediately after learning 

that “L’amour” was going to be 
performed, I set about trying 
to find a way to see it. I asked 
a few of my New York friends if 
I could stay with them around 
the holidays. I spoke with 
my parents about arranging 
transportation 
to 
the 
City. 

Over the course of the next 

few 
months, 
the 

trip began to take 
shape — the germ 
of my suggestion to 
my parents ended 
up blooming into a 
full-fledged family 
vacation to the City.

Saariaho 

herself 
is 
what 

might 
be 
termed 

a 
post-spectralist 

composer. 
Spectralism, 
a 
movement 

originating the the 

second half of the last century, 
focuses on the study of the 
physical properties of sound 
itself — its overtones, timbre, 
etc. — and the subsequent 
construction of music based 
on 
these 
properties. 
Some 

composers who are associated 
with this vein include the 
Frenchman Géard Grisey and 
the 
Brit 
Julian 
Anderson. 

Saariaho, on the other hand, 
takes heavy influence from 
spectralism — in terms of her 
sound-world — but composes 
music that is perhaps more 
Romantic in spirit, and more 
liberated. 
She 
takes 
the 

sonorities of spectralism and 
forms 
them 
into 
colorful, 

lower-case 
impressionistic 

images. Her great strength lies 
in her deft control over all of 
the timbral elements within 
her narrative, and the rich, 
large-scale palette of “L’amour 
de loin” allowed her to display 
this to the full.

“L’amour” has a simple plot, 

and, like an extremely high 
number of other operas, it’s a 
love story. The events of the 
drama follow Jaufré, a French 
nobleman and troubadore in 
the 12th-century who, through 
words and the image woven by 
a travelling pilgrim, falls in love 
with the countess of Tripoli, 
Clémence, from across the 
Mediterranean Sea. With the 
pilgrim as an interloper, and 
two begin a sort of extremely 

long-distance 
relationship, 

culminating in Jaufré crossing 
the Sea to meet the countess, 
only to die in her arms.

In the Met’s production — 

the first time they’ve produced 
an opera by a female composer 
in over a century, and only the 
second time ever at that — the 
stage is intersected by dozens 
of strings of vibrant, luminous 
color, 
which 
throughout 

the 
production 
move 
and 

imitate 
the 
Mediterranean 

Sea. Visually, in this way the 
production was magnificent. 
Through the beautiful French-
language libretto, themes of 
idealized love, piety, devotion 
and obsession are all explored. 
Arias and duets are interwoven 
in a captivating manner. The 
music throughout remains as 
a sort of haunted dream-scape, 
moving by slight adjustment 
through the range of nebulous 
moods that populate the opera.

After the curtain Fall, one 

thing in particular lingered 
in 
my 
mind: 
Namely, 
I 

contemplated the fact that a 
plot of such pure simplicity 
can 
nonetheless 
produce 

an 
engaging 
work 
of 
art. 

Much of this interest was 
surely generated through the 
arresting image on the stage, 
and the music propelled and 
commented upon the story in 
intriguing ways, but neither of 
these seem to fully explain the 
reason why the whole thing 
works.

In 
the 
end, 
the 
only 

explanation I can propose is 
simply that we, as a species, are 
endlessly fascinated with the 
concept of the unattainable — 
a figure which is at the core of 
this opera. Each of us engages 
in idealistic fantasizing about 
that which we realistically 
acknowledge we can never 
attain, whether it’s a faraway 
love, a meaningful contribution 
to the world or anything else. 
Perhaps, because of our own 
obsessions, watching a tale of 
idealistic devotion play out 
onstage is a form of cathartic 
giving-over, 
a 
vicarious 

consummation of our desires. 
Or 
perhaps 
its 
presence 

onstage is a type of validation, 
a sort of acknowledgement 
that unattainable desire is a 
universal. Whatever it is, its 
place at the center of our art is 
key to an understanding of who 
we are.

Wolverines drop first 
dual meet since 2010

The last time the Michigan 

men’s swimming and diving team 
lost a dual meet, Rich Rodriguez 
was still the coach of the Michigan 
football team, Tik Tok by Ke$ha 
was the No. 1 song in America, 
Snapchat had not been created yet 
and the unemployment rate was at 
9.8 percent.

But with their 167-133 loss at 

No. 4 Indiana on Friday, so too 
vanished the Wolverines’ streak 
of 55 straight dual meet victories, 
dating back to November of 2010.

“Obviously 
it’s 
very 

disappointing 
to lose a meet,” 
said 
junior 

PJ 
Ransford. 

“We’ve had a 
streak of wins 
going back to 
before 
I 
got 

to 
Michigan, 

and 
it’s 

disappointing to 
be the team that 
lets that streak 
end.”

No. 13 Michigan — now 

80-5-1 in dual meets since 2007 
— was nearly able to squeak 
out the victory on the road in 
Bloomington, 
with 
narrow 

margins at the top of the 
scoreboard determining many of 
the races. Ransford even called 
the meet the Wolverines’ “best 
performance of the year.” Eight 
of the 16 races were decided by 
less than half a second, three of 
which were determined by less 
than a tenth of a second. 

The Wolverines also placed 

2-3-4 in three events and 2-3-
4-5 in two events. It was that 
first-place finish, though, that 
proved elusive in too many races 
to overcome.

Despite 
victories 
from 

Ransford 
in 
the 
1,000-yard 

freestyle, junior Tristan Sanders 
in the 200-yard backstroke 

and freshman Felix Auböck 
in 
the 
500-yard 
freestyle, 

the Hoosiers won 13 of the 16 
races, enough to hold off the 
Wolverines’ depth.

But 
with 
the 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament 
looming, 
the 

team thinks this loss could be 
a blessing in disguise. For the 
first time in years, Michigan 
will not head into the conference 
tournament as the prohibitive 
favorite, and Ransford does not 
seem to mind. 

“While we always go into (the 

Big Ten Championship) wanting 
to win, I think losing to these 
guys once this year just adds a 

little 
bit 
more 

motivation,” 
he 

said. “We have 
never really been 
in an underdog 
role 
in 
recent 

years, 
and 
I 

think we have to 
embrace that as 
a team over the 
next two months. 
Big Tens is going 
to be a battle, and 

every extra bit of motivation we 
can get will help”

Added 
Bottom: 
“I 
think 

(motivation) depends on how 
much pain they feel and how 
much they don’t want to feel 
that pain again. They know what 
it’s like now to have a streak 
as glorious as the one we had 
broken. They feel the pain, and I 
hope they feel the loss. The word 
is ‘Hey, if you don’t want to have 
this happen again then we need 
to get better.’ ”

The Big Ten Tournament 

starts in just over a month, with 
dual meets against Ohio State 
and Michigan State in between. 
And if the Wolverines are able 
to take down Indiana — along 
with plenty of other formidable 
Big Ten opposition — to win the 
title, they might just look back 
on this meet as the wake-up call 
they needed.

WOMEN’S TENNIS
Wolverines open with 
Michigan Invitational

As junior Mira Ruder-Hook 

watched her opponent’s ball land 
out, it was almost anticlimactic. 
She had battled through the match 
composed of highs and lows, 
which forced her to continuously 
make comebacks, and the final 
point seemed too easy.

As the ball landed out, Ruder-

Hook’s teammates cheered not 
only for her, but also in celebration 
of their successful weekend. 
The Michigan women’s tennis 
team competed in the Michigan 
Invitational 
against 
Arizona 

State, DePaul and Tennessee, and 
though there was no team scoring, 
it was a perfect warm-up for the 
impending spring 
season.

Ruder-Hook 

got off to a rough 
start, falling into 
a 0-4 hole. But 
once she switched 
to more offensive 
play, she won five 
straight 
games 

to gain the lead. 
Tennessee’s 
Gabby 
Schuck 

made her fight 
for it, though, and tied it at five 
games apiece. But it was Ruder-
Hook who took the first set after 
she drove a forehand deep into the 
corner of the court.

Schuck’s aggressive style of 

play appeared to be too much for 
Ruder-Hook, who was down 4-1 
in the second set. But after the line 
judge overturned one of Schuck’s 
calls, Ruder-Hook argued that 
it was Schuck’s third time being 
overturned. If it had been, Ruder-
Hook would be awarded a game. 
But after a dispute between 
Ruder-Hook, the umpire and the 
Volunteers’ coach, Ruder-Hook 
wasn’t awarded the game.

That game might have made 

a big difference in the match’s 
outcome, because while Ruder-
Hook battled back to tie the game 
at five, Schuck ended up taking the 
set, 7-5.

Both 
players 
were 
evenly 

matched in the third set, but it was 
Ruder-Hook’s mental toughness 
that secured her the match, a 
point of emphasis for the junior.

“I think mental toughness is 

something you always have to 
work on,” Ruder-Hook said. “For 
me, I just try to present myself 
like I’m really confident and so in 
the moment at least it looks that 
way. And then it transitions to me 
and I start to feel more confident. 
I just told myself, ‘One point at a 
time.’ ”

Sophomore Kate Fahey and 

junior Alex Najarian continued 
their momentum from the fall 
season. The pair won the doubles 
title, winning every match of the 
weekend. 
The 
fourth-ranked 

duo’s most notable win came 

on 
Monday 

against the team 
of 
Savannah 

Slaysman 
and 

Kelley Anderson 
– the top pair for 
the Sun Devils. 
Fahey closed out 
the match, 6-3, 
with an ace up 
the middle.

Former 

partners, 
sophomore 

Brienne Minor and Ruder-Hook 
both played with a freshman 
this weekend, and though there 
are signs of a bright future 
ahead, there is surely room for 
improvement.

“I think there are a lot of things 

we need to work on, especially the 
doubles,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein. “The goal is to 
go match by match and peak in 
May.”

While this invitational was a 

good opportunity to get the team 
together again and to play real 
matches, it only makes the women 
even more excited for their real 
season to start.

“What’s 
so 
unique 
about 

college tennis and what makes it 
so much more fun is that you get to 
play with your team, so when the 
season starts we’re all so eager,” 
Ruder-Hook said. “I definitely 
prefer the (spring) season.”

‘M’ to face Spartans in home-and-home series

It’s his final year on the 

Michigan hockey team, and 
senior 
forward 
Evan 
Allen 

relishes 
his 

few remaining 
opportunities 
to play against 
rival Michigan 
State — with 
good 
reason.

Throughout 
Allen’s 
first 

three 
years, 

the Michigan 
hockey 
team 

has 
earned 

10 
wins 
in 

15 
games 

and 
notched 

another 
late 

victory 
last 

month.

“It’s 
the 

biggest weekend of the year for 
Michigan hockey,” Allen said 
on Wednesday. “We just gotta 
come together and take pride 
in our defense, because goals 
are precious. We just gotta bear 
down and get going against 
Michigan State.”

Defense will be crucial to the 

Wolverines’ success against the 
Spartans this weekend because 
goals are a luxury for them this 
season — Michigan averages just 
2.6 per game. The Wolverines 
also struggle to find shots, 
which Michigan coach Red 
Berenson attributes to a lack of 
opportunities with the puck in 
the opposition’s zone.

Last weekend in Minneapolis, 

the Wolverines showed some 
signs of offensive potential. They 
jumped out to an early lead Friday 
night and scored two late goals in 
the third period Saturday.

In practice this week, while 

showing his team game film 
from the weekend, Berenson 
pointed out certain defensive 
mistakes to his players.

“Our defense wasn’t gapping 

up on their forwards,” Berenson 
said. “They were giving their 
forwards too much room. We 

showed them a couple of clips 
where we did gap up on Saturday 
and then we had a good shift, we 
took over the play in their zone. 
When we didn’t gap up, we gave 
them our zone, and then we’re 
chasing them in our zone.”

It wasn’t solely defensive 

mistakes, however. Berenson 
explained that the Wolverines 
must improve their performance 
on special teams, an aspect 
of their game notably absent 
against No. 5 Minnesota. During 
that weekend’s series, Michigan 
earned just six power play 
chances — two on Friday and 
four on Saturday — and failed 
to score once. Defensively, the 
Wolverines’ penalty kill allowed 
two 
goals 
on 
11 
attempts, 

including a penalty shot.

Michigan 
State, 
though, 

contains significantly less star 
talent on its roster than the 
Gophers do. The Spartans sit 
last in the Big Ten standings, 
the only team behind Michigan. 
Michigan 
State 
nearly 
beat 

the Wolverines in the Great 
Lakes Invitational, overcoming 
a 
4-1 
third-period 
deficit, 

before ultimately losing 5-4 in 
overtime.

The 
Spartans 
have 
some 

impressive victories on their 
resume, 
defeating 
then-No. 

5 
North 
Dakota 
at 
Ralph 

Engelstad Arena on November 
25th. That series alone gives 
Berenson cause for concern, 
even if Michigan State has yet to 
defeat a conference opponent.

“(Michigan State) is capable 

of beating anyone on a given 
night,” Berenson said. “They get 
it going, and we saw it against 
us. We had them down and they 
came back in the third period, 
and they easily could’ve won the 
game.

“It’s 
not 
about 
Michigan 

State. I know it’s a rivalry and 
both teams are going to play 
hard, but records don’t mean 
anything. I think their team’s 
better than their record and I 
think our team can be better 
than our record, but we gotta 
prove it.”

Sophomore forward Mason 

Appleton leads the Spartans 
offensively with nine goals and 
19 points. His seven power play 
goals rank sixth nationally and 
second in the Big Ten. Appleton’s 
linemate, forward Joe Cox, will 
face off against the Wolverines 
for the fourth straight year. He 
is one of five players Allen has 
grown accustomed to seeing 
each time the two sides play.

“It’s our fourth year playing 

against 
them,” 
Allen 
said. 

“Right now, I’m on a line with 
(senior forward Alex) Kile and 
(senior forward Max) Shuart. 
Hopefully, we can take that 
into consideration against their 
young team. We can use us 
veterans, take it to them, because 
we know how Michigan State 
plays. We don’t like Michigan 
State and obviously, they don’t 
like us.”

Michigan has yet to win a 

conference game on the road 

this season, losing to then-No. 6 
Penn State and Minnesota twice. 
Saturday night provides another 
road test for the Wolverines as 
they will travel to Munn Arena 
for the series finale.

For now, though, Berenson is 

focused on the first game Friday 
night 
because 
those 
nights 

have proven to be a challenge 
for Michigan this season. The 
Wolverines’ last series-opening 
victory 
occurred 
back 
in 

November when the Wolverines 
shut out then-No. 4 Boston 
University.

“Let’s worry about Friday’s 

game,” Berenson said. “It’s on 
the schedule, and we’re playing 
it here. Let’s get excited about 
it. … We’ve gotta be better on 
Fridays.”

If Michigan can keep the 

puck out of its zone, gap up on 
defense and take advantage of 
its shooting chances, it certainly 
will.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Michigan coach Red Berenson will lead his team into a tense rivalry matchup.

Michigan falters in fourth quarter, 
falls on the road to No. 3 Maryland

Before 
Thursday’s 
contest 

against No. 3 Maryland, Michigan 
women’s basketball coach Kim 
Barnes Arico told her team, “We 
need to win five minutes at a time.”

With 

38 
seconds 
left 
in 

the third quarter, it appeared 
that the strategy was paying off, 
as the Wolverines held a 61-60 
advantage.

But then junior guard Katelynn 

Flaherty was called for a foul, 
sending Terrapins guard Iesha 
Small to the free-throw line, 
where she made one of two 
shots to tie the game. Forward 
Kiah Gillespie then made a 
buzzer-beating 3-pointer to give 
Maryland the lead.

The 
Wolverines 
unraveled 

from there, as they were outscored 
19-9 in the fourth quarter en route 
to an 83-70 defeat. The Terrapins 
dominated on the glass as well as 

in the paint, winning the second-
chance points battle, 23-5, and the 
points-in-the-paint battle, 54-26.

“I thought it was a great 

basketball game,” Barnes Arico 
said. “The final score didn’t really 
indicate how close of a game it was. 
Maryland is an outstanding team, 
and we knew that we were going 
to have a tough contest tonight. I 
was really proud of how our team 
responded for three quarters. 
I think Maryland’s depth and 
ability to force turnovers really 
helped them down the stretch.”

Michigan (4-2 Big Ten, 15-5 

overall) came out hot in the first 
quarter, racing out to a 17-10 
lead with 1:57 left. Flaherty and 
sophomore center Hallie Thome 
combined for 12 points and two 
rebounds in the frame. At the 
same time, Michigan capitalized 
on 
five 
Maryland 
turnovers, 

turning them into six points.

But then Thome picked up two 

fouls in the next three minutes, 
forcing her to the bench. Her 
absence was felt, as the Terrapins 
(6-0, 18-1) were able to string 

together a 16-2 run into the early 
minutes of the second quarter. 

Although Thome still played 

for just over two minutes in the 
second frame, her mobility was 
limited due to her hesitance 
to pick up a third foul. But her 
cautious approach didn’t stop 
her from picking up an offensive 
foul with 3:08 remaining before 
halftime, and Maryland took 
advantage, acquiring a 39-26 edge 
with 2:08 left in the frame.

“I think for big kids, their 

biggest 
strength 
in 
their 

development is to figure out the 
referees,” Barnes Arico said.

But then Terrapins center 

Brionna Jones was called for her 
second personal foul, sending her 
to the sideline. Michigan seized 
the opportunity and went on a 9-0 
run to end the half.

“She’s tough,” Barnes Arico 

said about Jones. “She’s tough 
to double, she finishes, she’s got 
quick moves. But she’s really, 
really, really consistent.”

The Wolverines’ good fortune 

was spearheaded by Flaherty, who 

scored the five final points of the 
half. Junior guard Maria Backman 
contributed off the bench during 
the run with two free throws and 
six rebounds in the final stretch of 
the second quarter.

Flaherty continued to put her 

team on her back in the third 
quarter. She scored ten points 
and nabbed a steal in the first 
three minutes of the frame, 
which allowed Michigan to attain 
a 
47-46 
advantage. 
Flaherty 

finished Thursday’s contest with 
30 points.

“My teammates put me in great 

positions,” Flaherty said. “(Senior 
guard Siera Thompson) is a great 
point guard. The rest of the team, 
they played to our strengths. They 
kept hitting me, and I think that 
helps. A lot of my points were in 
transition, and I like playing open 
court.”

Michigan 
proceeded 
to 

commit three turnovers, setting 
up four Maryland points. Even 
though freshman guard Kysre 
Gondrezick made two 3-pointers 
and Flaherty sank three free 
throws, propelling the Wolverines 
to a 61-60 lead, it would be their 
last of the game.

“We feel like we have great 

pieces that can score, that can 
score in transition,” Barnes Arico 
said. “We just got to be able to 
go for longer stretches like a 
team like Maryland does. And 
hopefully as the season goes on, 
we will continue to improve on 
that, and our younger kids will 
continue to get better and be able 
to provide some more minutes.”

With the loss, Michigan has 

now lost all four games it has 
played against teams currently 
ranked in the Associated Press 
Top 25, though none were ranked 
below 16th. 

Luckily for the Wolverines, 

there are no contests against 
ranked opponents left on their 
regular-season 
schedule. 

Michigan’s toughest remaining 
adversary on paper is Michigan 
State, who is currently 47th in 
the Ratings Percentage Index, 
fourteen 
spots 
below 
the 

Wolverines.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Behind Enemy Lines: 
Illinois’s John Groce

After 
a 
narrow 
loss 
at 

Wisconsin 
on 
Tuesday, 
the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
will come home to Ann Arbor to 
face Illinois once again Saturday.

The last time the two teams 

faced off was back on Jan. 
11, when the Wolverines fell 
to the Fighting Illini, 85-69, 
in Champaign. Senior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. was called for 
a technical foul in the first half, 
which changed the course of the 
game, as Illinois went on a 17-2 
run to end the stanza and never 
looked back.

After 
the 
game, 
Fighting 

Illini forward Maverick Morgan 
called Michigan a “white-collar” 
team, which didn’t sit well with 
the Wolverines, so there will be 
no shortage of motivation for the 
home team.

The Daily sat down with 

Illinois coach John Groce at Big 
Ten Media Day in October to talk 
about dealing with injuries, the 
growth of his team and the next 
steps the Fighting Illini need to 
take to be a Big Ten contender.

The 
Michigan 
Daily: 

Last season, you had a couple 
“almost” wins when you almost 
beat Maryland and you almost 
beat Penn State. In your mind, 
what does your team need to do 
to get over that hump?

John Groce: We need to 

get healthy, and we have. I’m 
glad it happened now, but it 
wasn’t fun going through it 
(last season). But if you took any 
team (in the Big Ten) and took 
away their starting ‘1’, ‘4’ and ‘5’ 
and play the Big Ten schedule, 
that’s a lot. Everybody has an 
injury. Michigan’s had their 
fare share of injuries too, and it 
certainly hampers growth and 
development, and they’ve done 
a great job of thrusting through 
that. I thought our guys had that 
same mindset last year.

TMD: You mentioned that 

you’re glad it happened today. 
Why is that?

JG: I thought we played well 

in the Big Ten Tournament, and 
it showed their character that 
they did want to keep playing. 
I loved how well we played 
overall, and I thought that was 
great heading into this year. 
Some guys got experience when 
they might not have otherwise. 
So now it’s become a blessing 
(to) have all those guys that are 
experienced and seasoned. It 
bodes well for us.

TMD: 
Now 
that 
you’re 

healthy, what’s the next step 
your team needs to take?

JG: The next thing for us is to 

get back to defending the way we 
did the first three years (of my 
tenure). Of course, a lot of things 
like injuries are tied to that last 
year, but our defense was not 
good enough. It was poor, and it 
has to be a lot better.

TMD: What do you think 

about the defense is lacking? Is 
it the general hustle of the team 
or may (it be) tied to X’s and O’s?

JG: I think it’s strength, and 

we’re a lot stronger this season. 
I think it’s experience. I think 
it’s health, execution of the little 
things and valuing the little 
things. It’s a lot of different 
things and we’re at a different 
place in those areas than we 
were a year ago with everything 
we’ve been through.

TMD: When you talk about 

the “little things”, do you mean 
your team lacked grit? What do 
you mean by that?

JG: We weren’t tough for me 

overall. We played a lot of young 
guys. They got knocked around 
a lot and were baptized by fire. 
Now the first three years (of my 
tenure), we were tough dudes. 
But we’ve got to get back to that 
toughness and that grittiness, 
and it’s exemplified certainly 
on the defensive end and on the 
backboard.

‘M’ shows defensive improvement
but happy medium yet to be found

Wisconsin coach Greg Gard 

had five days to prepare his side 
for a Michigan team lucky to be 
stumbling into the Kohl Center 
with a 2-4 Big 
Ten record. In 
the middle of 
a 
conference 

basketball 
season, 
that 

length of time 
is almost an 
eternity. 
But 

five 
days 
is 

especially 
excessive 
considering 
the discipline 
of the Badgers’ 
roster and the 
porousness 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ 
defense coming into the game.

But at the end of the first half 

Tuesday, Wisconsin had just 26 
points on the 
scoreboard.

The Badgers 

didn’t 
have 

any 
offensive 

plays 
worthy 

of making the 
SportsCenter 
highlight 
reel 

for later that 
night.

And 
the 

students, who 
returned to the Kohl Center for 
the first time after their winter 
break, were planted in their 
seats at halftime, too bored to 
jump around after a forgettable 
20 minutes of basketball.

In that half, and for the first 

time in Big Ten play, Michigan’s 
defense showed sustained signs 
of life.

Sophomore 
forward 

Moritz Wagner and redshirt 
sophomore forward DJ Wilson, 
who were both exposed as 
the soft underbelly of the 
Wolverine defense against the 
likes of Maryland and Illinois, 
had firmed up.

Wilson 
established 
his 

physical presence on the first 
play, 
blocking 
Wisconsin 

forward Ethan Happ at the 
hoop, and contained forward 
Nigel Hayes to 2-for-8 shooting. 
Wagner had just as much 
success 
with 
his 
defensive 

assignment 
and 
prevented 

Happ from finding any rhythm 
down low.

If 
the 
physicality 
and 

aggression the pair had shown 
could have been matched for 
another 20 minutes, Michigan 
likely would have left Madison 
reborn with a signature win 
and realistic hopes of finishing 
in the top half of the Big Ten.

But 
in 
the 
second 
half, 

the 
Wolverines 
turned 
the 

aggression dial all the way to 11. 

That proved to be 
a costly mistake.

Within a span 

of three minutes, 
Wilson 
picked 

up three fouls. 
Forty-three 
seconds 
after 

that, 
Wagner 

picked 
up 
his 

third foul. And 
with 8:16 to go, 
Wagner 
was 

called for his fourth.

The team that came into 

Tuesday’s contest committing 
the fewest fouls in the country 
had two of its starters a whistle 
away from disqualification at 
the game’s most crucial stretch.

While the Wolverines left 

the Kohl Center feeling more 
confident in their defense than 
they have been in recent weeks, 

questions still remain on where 
Michigan will move forward 
defensively.

“Having us in foul trouble 

obviously 
doesn’t 
help 
us,” 

Wagner said. “So, we’ve got 
to find a way to be physical 
without fouling, especially in 
the second half. I think that 
four-minute battle where we 
just gave up too many easy foul 
calls to the post and rebounds.”

Tuesday 
night 
was 
an 

overcorrection from the issues 
the Wolverines suffered on 
defense in their past few Big 
Ten games. In their defensive 
calamity 
against 
Illinois, 

Wilson 
and 
Wagner 
barely 

moved 
while 
defending 
at 

times. They let guards heading 
for the basket blow right past 
them, and set themselves too 
early for charges or too far from 
the hoop to grab rebounds.

The 
two 
forwards 
now 

know where the two ends of 
the aggression spectrum are, 
and where they need to be 
defensively 
should 
be 

clearer 
now.

“Our 

maturity 
level has to 
grow 
(so) 

that 
we 

know what 
is 
a 
foul 

and 
what 

(is) 
not,” 

Wagner said. “(We need to) 
practice harder to be able to 
play defense without fouling. 
It’s on us to change that.”

But other defensive issues 

still persist, especially with 
the Wolverines’ options off the 
bench.

Freshman center Jon Teske 

played 
his 
first 
important 

Big Ten minutes, much to the 

delight of many Michigan fans 
yearning for an appearance 
from him. But in the three 
minutes he spent on the court 
in the first half, Teske showed 
exactly why he doesn’t have a 
larger role at the moment.

Though his seven-foot frame 

is unique and not offered by 
Wagner 
or 
senior 
forward 

Mark Donnal, Teske doesn’t 
have the fundamentals to be 
an imposing option down low 
yet. The freshman gave up an 
offensive rebound and an easy 
layup while on the court, and 
was 
quickly 
replaced 
after 

those lapses.

But even more important 

at the moment, Teske doesn’t 
have what makes Wagner and 
Donnal more valuable for the 
Wolverines offensively — a 
3-point shot.

Redshirt 
junior 
guard 

Duncan Robinson, who was 
as 
important 
for 
Michigan 

as he’s ever been offensively 
on Tuesday, still isn’t coming 

off the bench with 
the same level of 
physicality 
as 
his 

teammates. 
At 
a 

point in the second 
half 
against 
the 

Badgers, 
Michigan 

coach John Beilein 
grabbed 
his 
arm 

muscle as Robinson 
passed by the bench 
after 
allowing 
a 

basket, signaling to 

the redshirt junior that using 
his own could have prevented 
the score.

The Wolverines will feel 

some relief knowing the ranges 
in which they have to defend 
physically. Now, Michigan has 
to find the defensive balance 
for a full 40 minutes to reach 
the potential it showed against 
the Badgers.
