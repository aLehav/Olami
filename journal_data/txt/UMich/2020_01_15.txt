This is the first installment of 
a three-part series investigating 
student mental health at the 
University of Michigan. The Daily 
interviewed students on campus 
and across the country as well 
as prominent leaders in mental 

health. In parts two and three, The 
Daily will examine alternative 
mental health resources on campus 
and how mental health systems 
work at other universities, such as 
Michigan State University.
Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 
sophomore Dana Rath’s winter 
semester of her freshman year 
did not go smoothly. 
She got sick three times in 

one month and ended a tough 
relationship at the beginning 
of 2019. Combined with the 
culture of stress in the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance, she 
was unable to apply for summer 
music programs because all 
the deadlines passed while she 
was ill. The toll on her physical 
health impacted her mental 
health as well and she turned to 

The University’s Counseling and 
Psychological Services.
“That’s when I saw CAPS,” 
Rath said. “When you’re going 
through stuff like this, it feels 
really isolating. I felt really alone 
… I was feeling overwhelmed and 
sad about being overwhelmed 
with everything that’s going on.”

The University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Republicans 
hosted their weekly meeting 
Tuesday in the Michigan League 
to discuss Iran-United States 
relations.. About 25 students 
and members of the University 
community attended the event, 
as well as board members of the 
organization. 
The meeting opened with 
general announcements about 
upcoming 
events 
by 
Maria 
Muzarieta, College Republicans 
chair and LSA senior. It was 

followed by a presentation on 
events in Iran by LSA sophomore 
Max 
Resnick, 
treasurer 
of 
College Republicans and Kathy 
Zhu, vice chair of College 
Republicans and LSA senior.
Resnick gave a brief outline 
of Iran’s modern history, from 
its constitutional monarchy in 
1906 to the rise of Ayatollah 
Khomeini, commenting on the 
current state of oppression. 
Resnick 
and 
Zhu 
then 
explained 
the 
Iran-U.S. 
relationship, 
touching 
on 
Iranian 
attempts 
to 
enrich 
uranium. 
“At first, we had evidence that 
they were enriching uranium, 

and you can enrich uranium for 
two reasons,” Resnick said. “You 
can either use it for fuel, or you 
can use it for weapons.”
The 
presenters 
also 
mentioned the Iran nuclear 
deal, under which Iran agreed 
to limit its nuclear activities and 
allow access to international 
inspectors in exchange for the 
lifting of crippling economic 
sanctions.
“Iran says that its activities 
were peaceful,” Resnick said. 
“So, we had sanctions. Obama 
signs the Iran Deal. President 
Trump pulls out.”
Resnick further discussed the 
 
Iran-U.S. relations in terms of the 

Iran-Iraq War, commenting on 
the criticism about the U.S. supply 
of weapons to the Middle East.
“I think what’s important 
to remember is, like, we say, 
‘Oh, we gave weapons to Saudi 
Arabia, and then there is a 
regime change in Saudi Arabia, 
and they do something that we 
don’t like,’ ” Resnick said. “And 
then people complain that we 
gave weapons to them. So, I 
don’t know if it’s a fair criticism 
to say, ‘Well, we were giving 
weapons to Iran and, like, they 
have a religious coup, took over 
the government and started 
sponsoring terrorism abroad.’ ” 

Lisa 
Gordon-Hagerty, 
Under Secretary for Nuclear 
Security and Administrator of 
the National Nuclear Security 
Administration, 
visited 
the 
Duderstadt Center Tuesday as 
part of a recruiting event for the 
National Security Enterprises. 
Approximately 30 students and 
researchers attended.
Gordon-Hagerty 
attended 
the University of Michigan for 
undergraduate and graduate 
school, 
graduating 
with 
a 
bachelor’s degree in 1983 and a 
master’s in health physics from 
the School of Public Health in 
1986. She has previously served 
as a staff member for the House 
of Representatives Committee 
on Energy and Commerce and 
as acting director in the Office 
of Emergency Response and the 
Office of Weapons Surety. 
In 
1998, 
President 
Bill 
Clinton appointed her to be 
director of the White House 
Office of Combating Terrorism, 
which is under the National 
Security Council. After serving 
a few years in the private sector, 
Gordon-Hagerty returned to 
the public sector, accepting 
her current position with the 
NNSA.

At 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Central 
Student 
Government meeting Tuesday 
night, 
Assembly 
members 
approved a new vice president, 
announced the creation of a 
Campus 
Climate 
Advisory 
Council and discussed new 
initiatives 
by 
the 
Transfer 
Student Resources Committee 
and the Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion 
Commission. 
The 
meeting was the first of the 
Winter 2019 semester. 
LSA 
junior 
Evie 
Winter 
was 
unanimously 
approved 
as the new Central Student 
Government 
vice 
president. 
Winter previously served as 
Chief of Staff under Daniel 
Greene’s 
administration 
and 
most recently as CSG’s director 
of outreach. 
In his nominating speech, 
CSG President Ben Gerstein, 
Public Policy senior, detailed 
Winter’s accomplishments in 
her director of outreach role, 
including 
the 
bolstering 
of 
CSG’s internship program and 
improvement of CSG’s outreach 
to student organization through 
her “coffee chat initiative.”

First-year applicants to the 
University of Michigan now 
have the option to submit an 
additional essay separate from 
the three required as part of the 
application.
The 
Daily 
obtained 
a 
screenshot of the webpage 
informing applicants of the 
essay from a high school senior 
who was deferred and requested 
anonymity due to concern for 
her application status.
The page notes the essay 
form is the only expression 
of 
continued 
interest 
the 
University will consider. Any 
other 
communications 
from 
students outside of the form 
— with the exception of recent 
grades — will not be added to 
their application.
The form asks students, in 
250 words or less, to “describe 
how your personal educational 

goals connect to the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
mission 
and 
values.”
In an email to The Daily, 
Erica 
Sanders, 
Office 
of 
Undergraduate 
Admissions 
director, wrote that this form 
replaces all other forms of 
continued 
interest. 
Some 
students 
have 
previously 
submitted a “letter of continued 
interest,” a mechanism often 
recommended 
by 
school 
counselors 
or 
in 
online 
discussion 
boards 
such 
as 
College Confidential to show 
ongoing interest after being 
deferred in early admission 
rounds.
For postponed early action 
applicants, 
the 
preferred 
deadline for this form is Feb. 
1 and for regular decision 
applicants, 
the 
deadline 
is 
March 
1. 
Sanders 
said 
applicants can complete at their 
discretion.

Students struggle to find adequate 
mental health resources on campus

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 DESIGN BY LIZZY RUEPPEL


But Rath was not alone. 
CAPS received more than 5,000 
requests for services in the 
2018-2019 school year and 57 
percent of University students 
reported feeling overwhelming 
anxiety. However, as students 
seek support for mental health, 
concerns about the inadequacies 
of the University’s mental health 
system are persistent. Grievances 
range from long wait times 
for CAPS initial consultations 
to inefficient distribution of 
resources between North and 
Central campuses and a lack of 
support for students of color.
Waiting for CAPS
Students 
have 
expressed 
their 
frustration 
with 
the 
wait time at CAPS through 
memes in Facebook groups and 
various petitions to increase 
CAPS resources and counselor 
availability. The wait time for 

an initial consultation at CAPS 
was the most common grievance 
among the University students 
interviewed for this story. 
Last semester’s wait times 
continue to drive the negative 
perception of the University’s 
mental 
health 
resources 
on 
campus. Todd Sevig, chair of 
UM 
Student 
Mental 
Health 
Work Group, told The Daily 
that the longest wait time for a 
CAPS appointment was two and 
a half weeks and they had the 
shortest wait time in Ann Arbor. 
However, many students said 
they waited much longer than 
two weeks.
According 
to 
the 
CAPS 
website, the initial consultation 
wait time is currently down 
to two business days. CAPS 
acknowledged the long wait 
times during the fall semester 
and attributed it to increased 
demand. 
Students 
vent 
frustration 
about the wait times through 
social 
media. 
CAPS-related 

memes were voted the second-
best meme of 2019 by over 1,300 
users in the “UMich Memes for 
Wolverteens” Facebook group. 
Meme 
tournament 
organizer 
Lucas Renno described CAPS 
as 
“representing 
pessimism, 
something broken within the 
University that may well be 
unfixable.”
In an interview with The 
Daily, Sevig emphasized the 
efforts at CAPS to address 
student concerns.
“I will meet with any student 
who wants to meet with me 
about CAPS or mental health,” 
Sevig said. “We changed our 
intake model five years ago. That 
only came from a student who 
was upset at the wait time for 
getting into CAPS. The dialogue, 
back and forth, I love it. So, email 
me with suggestions.”
LSA senior Sulayman Qazi told 
The Daily he was struggling with 
generalized 
anxiety 
disorder 
and was feeling out of place as a 
transfer student when he tried 

to make a CAPS appointment in 
Fall 2018.
“The 
wait 
time 
when 
I 
checked was 20-something days, 
and a friend of mine waited even 
longer,” Qazi said. “He said by 
the time he saw them, he was 
already over the situation he 
was having, and so he just had to 
compartmentalize it himself. I 
thought that was scary.”
LSA sophomore Eva Schwartz 
said students who would like 
to talk to someone sooner but 
do not feel like their situation 
warrants a crisis counselor are 
left in the dark.
“If 
you’ve 
made 
an 
appointment, the CAPS website 
could do a better job displaying 
other resources on campus in 
the meantime,” Schwartz said. 
“It’d be helpful to have a page 
that says, ‘If this doesn’t work 
for you, maybe consider going 
to Wolverine Wellness,’ or ‘Here 
are some of the other resources,’ 
outlined.”

Local coffee shop Elixir Vitae, 
known for its chai lattes, diverse 
clientele and creative wall art 
shut its doors on Dec. 20 after 
almost two decades. Located 
across the street from Nickels 
Arcade and thought of by many 
loyal customers as a hidden gem 
of Ann Arbor, the store’s regulars 
lamented its closing. 
LSA senior Ola Amokomowo, 
Elixir regular, said she will 
miss many things about the 
cafe, including its teas and the 
welcoming community. 
“It’s honestly so upsetting,” 
Amokomowo said. “I just recently 
became a regular, actually. I heard 
about it at the beginning of my 
senior year, and it got to the point 
where I was going almost every 
day basically because they have 

the best London Fog I’ve ever had 
in my life. You just knew that your 
business mattered. I felt like a part 
of something bigger than myself.”
According to loyal customers, 
Elixir stood out from Ann Arbor’s 
many local coffee shops because 
of its staff and warm environment. 
Amokomowo elaborated on her 
own Elixir experience, calling 
Elixir a “standout.”
“It really was a local standout 
place. It felt homey. I knew 
that they cared about my day, I 
cared about the baristas’ day,” 
Amokomowo said. “I really loved 
it. I enjoyed being there so much, 
and I’m pretty sad that it’s gone.”
Jimmy Curtiss worked at Elixir 
Vitae as a barista for 15 years. He 
said he valued Elixir’s community-
oriented values.
“It really was a townie coffee 
shop that I feel like didn’t actually 
cater to any specific demographic. 
It was just kind of for everyone 

which was really, really cool,” 
Curtiss said. “It was its own 
little insular universe, and it was 
just bizarre, because it was this 
isolated, self-contained space, and 
yet it was so close to campus.”
The owner of Elixir Vitae did 
not respond to The Daily’s request 
for comment on why the coffee 
shop closed in time for publication. 
LSA 
junior 
Basil 
Alsubee, 
another Elixir regular said he was 
impressed by the cafe’s hospitality, 
especially 
with 
customers 
experiencing homelessness.
“It’s 
just 
a 
very 
homey, 
unpretentious, welcoming place 
for me,” Alsubee said. “I don’t 
know a coffee shop in Ann Arbor 
that’s been as kind to the homeless 
population in Ann Arbor as Elixir.”
Alsubee said he appreciated 
how accepting the atmosphere at 
Elixir is .
“As a Muslim, I have five prayers 
every day … and Elixir was actually 

one of the very few places where 
I did that quite regularly and at 
some point the baristas noticed, 
and they actually were so kind 
to bring me a small little prayer 
rug that was in the corner of the 
coffee shop that I regularly used,” 
Alsubee.
LSA senior Leena Ghannam 
said Ann Arbor is losing several 
small 
local 
businesses 
like 
Elixir and, with them, a sense of 
familiarity and belonging. 
“It had accumulated a really 
strong base of people who would 
go there frequently, and so it’s 
kind of sad because once the place 
leaves, the community leaves with 
it. It’s no longer essentialized,” 
Ghannam said. “I think it’s a real 
shame, especially because a lot 
of other, older businesses in Ann 
Arbor have been shutting down 
in the past five years, and I think 
they’re being replaced by a lot of 
larger corporations.”

Students mourn loss of local coffee shop’s ‘welcoming’ and ‘inclusive’ environment

Elixir Vitae closes doors after nearly 20 
years to disappointment of customers

Jan. 7, 1972: Free classes offered by education, social
change program to continue despite Smith’s statement

The Program for Educational 
and 
Social 
Change 
(PESC) 
has accelerated its plans to 
open University courses to the 
public 
free-of-charge 
despite 
Vice President Allan Smith’s 
statement Thursday that such 
a program violates University 
policy. 
At a meeting of PESC members 
and 
supporters 
yesterday, 
psychology Prof. Richard Mann 
dismissed Smith’s statement as 
“ranting and raving,” and said it 
held little weight. 
A PESC publication says that 

all PESC courses are “open to 
all, and free to non-University 
people.” 
Smith 
Thursday 
described” such a policy as being 
“not within the province of 
the program personnel nor the 
individual professor.” 
PESC members, both students 
and faculty members, agreed 
yesterday to step-up the publicity 
of their program – as originally 
constituted. 
Hoping to squelch opposition 
to the idea of free auditing of 
courses by those not enrolled in 
the University, PESC will begin 

referring 
to 
the 
community 
auditors as “resource people” 
or 
“colleagues,” 
rather 
than 
“students.” 
In addition, PESC is urging its 
supporters to appear en masse at 
Monday’s meeting of the literary 
college faculty. 
Mann also revealed that he 
and six other PESC members 
had met with the LSA Executive 
Committee 
and 
Dean 
Frank 
Rhodes Thursday to discuss 
PESC’s structure and funding. 
While PESC presented its request 
of $4,600 from the $50,000 fund 

earmarked for “innovation” in 
LSA, the committee offered no 
definitive responses, according 
to Mann. 
However, 
English 
Prof. 
Robert Super, a member of the 
LSA committee, said that the 
funding question had assumed 
no importance in the meeting, 
whose primary purpose was the 
edification of the committee 
members with respect to PESC. 
The 
LSA 
committee 
had 
presented PESC with a number 
of 
administrative 
questions, 
many of which were answered 

‘at yesterday’s PESO meeting. For 
example, the question of whether 
community 
participation 
in 
the courses would affect their 
quality and/or close them to 
regular students was countered 
by PESC’s assertion that students 
registering for PESC courses are 
fully aware of their access to 
community members. 
PESC 
pointed 
to 
the 
University’s 
“terrible 
relationship” 
with 
the 
community and the expansion of 
University curriculum, brought 
about by the new PESC courses, 

as further justifications for its 
acceptance. 
Charles 
Thomas, 
who 
is 
president of the Black Economic 
Development League and plans 
to 
instruct 
a 
PESC 
course 
entitled “’The Socio-Economic 
and Political Foundations of 
County Politics,” said that the 
qualifications of nonprofessors 
in PESC should not be challenged 
by the University.
His 
statement 
apparently 
anticipated a debate over whether 
courses such as his could grant 
credit hours to University students.

“She is well-versed in the 
functions of our organization 
and 
possesses 
a 
deep 
understanding 
of 
campus 
partnerships,” 
Gerstein 
said. 
“Stepping into the role as CSG 
vice president in the closing 
months of any administration’s 
term is no easy task. But given 
Evie’s experience, my personal 
friendship 
with 
her, 
my 
understanding and knowledge 
that she has the passion, drive 
and will to do this work, I am 
fully confident she is going to be 
able to execute this position to 
the best of her ability.”
Rackham 
student 
Hayden 
Jackson, chair of the Executives 
Nomination Committee, read 
excerpts from the Executives 
Nomination Committee’s report 
on Winter’s eligibility for the 
position 
as 
vice 
president. 
Jackson said the committee 
felt she would be a good fit 
for the role. However, they 

had concerns about Winter’s 
comments in the report about 
the administration’s lack of 
accomplishments 
during 
the 
first semester and her lack of 
attendance at the University 
Council, a core function of the 
vice presidency.

“It remains a concern for 
us that there was more room 
for events and initiatives for 
completion in the first semester, 
but that Ms. Winter was largely 
unable to articulate a long list 
of accomplishments,” Jackson 
said. “That said, overall, we 
believe Ms. Winter would do a 
good job serving in the role for 
the remainder of the year, as 
she would carry out former Vice 
President Blanchard’s projects 
to completion, and she already 
understands 
the 
Gerstein 
administration 
and 
how 
it 
works.” 
According 
to 
the 
report, 
Winter had previously attended 
one Assembly meeting in the 
Fall 2019 semester and no UC 
meetings.

Responding 
to 
concerns 
about attendance at University 
Council and Assembly, Winter 
acknowledged she has never 
been to a UC meeting, but also 
argued the UC has had issues 
determining what “that space 
and time should be used for.” She 
said she will be attending the 
first meeting to understand the 
body’s priorities and work from 
there to support UC in passing 
legislation or planning events. 
“To clarify, this part of the 
report is mostly referring to 
my specific accomplishments. I 
spent most of the first semester 
working 
and 
developing 
a 
coffee chat program,” Winter 
responded. “I didn’t do a lot of 
the large-scale events, but that’s 
not to say that our administration 
hasn’t 
been 
productive 
and 
that we haven’t been working 
on things and planning events 
throughout the year.”
Gerstein also announced plans 
to launch a Campus Climate 
Advisory Council ahead of the 
2020 presidential debate that 
will be hosted on campus. The 

council aims to build a united 
campus community and foster a 
welcoming space for all students 
in a divisive environment. To 
ensure 
this 
work 
continues 
beyond the presidential election 
year, it is slated to be a standing 
body composed of students, staff 
and faculty from a variety of 
student organizations. 
Additionally, 
Gerstein 
reported 
that 
the 
Student 
Fee 
Advisory 
Committee, 
a 
body 
which 
contributes 
to 
the Office of Student Life’s 
budget request to the provost, 
advocated primarily to increase 
the allocation of funds for 
resources to support student 
mental health. The Student Fee 
Advisory Committee proposal 
integrated insights from CSG’s 
mental 
health 
survey 
and 
requested that additional funds 
go to limit wait times at CAPS. 
LSA 
sophomore 
and 
representative 
Sam 
Braden 
addressed the progress of the 
plans for an LSAT prep course 
and highlighted its popularity 
amongst students.

“We have over 130 students 
who want to take it and 140 
who want to teach it,” Braden 
said. “I will be interviewing 
all the students next week and 
choosing six of them to teach the 
students.”
LSA junior Hershy Jalluri, 
chair of the Diversity, Equity, 
and 
Inclusion 
Commission, 
spoke about the force’s plans 
to create a platform to increase 
accessibility 
to 
DEI-focused 
resources. Jalluri also shared 
plans to create DEI focus groups 
at student organization mass 
meetings.
LSA senior Eva Kluting, chair 
of Transfer Student Resource 
Commission, spoke on future 
plans to strengthen ties among 
transfer students and increase 
their access to resources.
“The transfer community is 
a little bit smaller, but we are 
trying to get people in, and our 
biggest project right now is the 
transfer students’ symposium,” 
Kluting said. “We are going to 
be a space for students to speak 
with administrators, talk about 

transfer issues like housing 
transportation and orientation. 
It’ll be a better place to facilitate 
discussion 
between 
students 
and the administration.”
Engineering 
senior 
Zeke 
Majeske 
was 
approved 
as 
the 
Bystander 
Intervention 
Training 
Liaison. 
Majeske, 
who nominated himself, shared 
plans to increase transparency 
and efficiency in the role by 
eliminating it.
Members also participated in 
a hand-ballot election to settle 
the tiebreaker between the two 
Rackham 
Graduate 
Student 
Representative 
candidates, 
Gerson Ramirez, Public Policy 
graduate student, and Rackham 
student Siddharth Singh. Singh 
was elected. 
The Assembly also elected 
the 
vice-chair 
of 
Executive 
Nominations, choosing between 
two 
nominees, 
Rackham 
student Matthew Lesko and 
LSA senior Annabel Weinbach. 
Lesko was selected through a 
secret ballot.

Sevig acknowledges the system 
can backlog with long wait times 
in the fall as it processes a huge 
influx of students who are new to 
campus and struggling to adjust 
to college. CAPS saw 875 new 
clients in September 2018, more 
than double the number of an 
average month. While the wait 
time is back down to four days 
as of publication, Sevig said the 
recent surges have overwhelmed 
CAPS.
“The first five weeks last fall, 
we had about 300 students per 
week asking for help,” Sevig 
said. “So those 300 students who 
come in the first week need to 
be seen the second week, and 
you have another 300 who are 
new that second week, and then 
it just goes on every week. So, 
we’re doing a lot of work this 
year to think about how we can 
navigate next fall.”
Sevig did not specify his 
plans for reducing wait times 
but said he is looking at adding 
more counselors and is open to 
student input on how they’d like 
the process to change.
CAPS currently houses 39 
licensed 
permanent 
clinical 
staff and 16 professionals-in-
training. Sevig acknowledged 
there are trade-offs in the 
current staffing model, which 
consists of initial, crisis and 
ongoing consultation. 
“We could have the wait time 
for a scheduled appointment be 
two days,” Sevig said. “But if we 
were to do that, we would be 
sacrificing either the crisis work 
or the ongoing work. In any 
clinical agency, you’re balancing 
initial, ongoing and crisis work, 
so I want to increase initial and 
ongoing and maybe all three.”
In the 2019-20 fiscal year, 
Counseling Services was allotted 
almost $3 million. When asked 
what an increase in funding 
would mean for CAPS, Sevig 
said he would defer to students.
“We ask our Student Advisory 
Board, ‘If we were to grow, 
how could we best use new 
staff? Do we want to do online 
interventions? How long should 
that initial appointment be?’” 
Sevig said. “If we get new 
staffing and new funding, what 
we will do with it will be driven 
by students.”
A need for diversity
Students 
of 
color 
voiced 
concern about being able to find 
a counselor who can relate to 
their experiences on campus. 
LSA freshman Alia Cummings 
said it’s difficult to connect with 
counselors who do not innately 
understand the perspectives of 
students of color.
“One thing that I’ve noticed 
is that there aren’t that many 
people of color who are therapists 

on campus,” Cummings said. 
“Hearing from my peers, one 
of the things that we notice is 
when we go into these areas 
and we have different struggles 
and things like that … although 
it’s good to talk to a therapist, 
if the person does not look like 
us, then it’s very difficult for the 
person to be able to relate to us 
about what we’re talking about 
or to be able to even express 
those feelings because we know 
that the ability to relate will be 
very limited.”
Sevig said that CAPS is 
dedicated to diversity in their 
office and they put the photos of 
all their staff on the website to 
show their efforts. 
“We 
acknowledge 
the 
diversity, and we work with it,” 
Sevig said. “Our staffing reflects 
the diversity. About half of us are 
people of color.”
Connecting 
to 
North 
Campus
One of the biggest challenges 
campus mental health resources 
face is connecting with students 
on North Campus, which is up to 
a thirty-minute commute from 
the main CAPS and UHS offices. 
In the CSG Mental Health 
Taskforce report, 50 percent 
of students who take classes or 
live on North Campus said the 
physical distance from Central 
Campus CAPS has deterred 
them from using CAPS.
In response, CAPS is reaching 
out 
to 
students 
on 
North 
Campus through the embedded 
model, which places a dedicated 
staff counselor in 13 schools and 
colleges across both North and 
Central Campuses. Sevig said he 
envisions a further expansion 
of 
embedded 
counselors 
to 
include 
currently 
uncovered 
colleges, including the Schools 
of Education, Environment and 
Sustainability, 
Information, 
Kinesiology and Public Policy.
Since the CAPS office is 
located on Central Campus, it 
can be difficult for students in 
other colleges to seek out their 
services. Embedded counselors 
learn about the culture of the 
college they are assigned and 
meet with students from those 
schools. They also give referrals 
for students when they need 
additional assistance.
Rath reached out to Emily 
Hyssong, 
the 
embedded 
counselor at the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance, when she was 
going through a hard time, and 
through Hyssong, was able to 
make 
an 
appointment 
with 
CAPS.
“I only found out about it 
through a counselor in the 
music school, she told me about 
it,” Rath said. “She didn’t have 
enough room to see me herself. 
She had enough patients, so she 
recommended me to CAPS.”
Even 
though 
embedded 
counselors 
in 
the 
Schools 
of Music, Theatre & Dance, 

Engineering, 
Art 
and 
Architecture 
and 
Urban 
Planning are accessible to the 
majority 
of 
North 
Campus 
students, students at schools 
on Central Campus who end 
up living on North still face the 
barrier of a commute to seek 
professional help. 
“It is very far. I had one 
appointment that I waited a 
long time for, but due to the 
bus system, I was late and had 
to wait another four weeks for 
the next appointment,” said 
a student quoted in the CSG 
Mental Health Taskforce report. 
“I was discouraged and did not 
return to CAPS until I moved to 
Central Campus the next year. 
That was when I received the 
help I needed.”
When asked about outreach 
efforts to North Campus, Sevig 
said CAPS experimented briefly 
with counselors in Pierpont 
Commons in the early 2000s, but 
he said he sees that abandoned 
project as a failure.
“Students would come in 
and interrupt the counselors, 
they would open the door, they 
weren’t available. It just didn’t 
work.” Sevig said. “But there 
are a lot of students on North 
Campus who aren’t in embedded 
schools, so it’s on my list to think 
about accessibility for them.”
Defining a ‘Crisis’
CAPS offers crisis services 
but several students interviewed 
for this story said they were 
unaware of what is considered 
a crisis in order for them to see 
CAPS. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Noelle 
Seward suffered a concussion 
in October of 2019 and had to 
ask for accommodations in her 
classes. When she was struggling 
with keeping up with her classes 
and getting accommodations, 
she sought out CAPS to help her 
with the anxiety, but she did not 
think her situation was a crisis.
“There was such a long 
waiting period, and I don’t feel 
like this is something I can wait 
for,” Seward said. “They say, ‘If 
you’re in an absolute emergency, 
then you can come in.’ I don’t 
want to take that spot away from 
someone who is having suicidal 
thoughts or something, because 
they may need it more than I do, 
but that doesn’t mean I can wait 
two months to have my issue 
addressed.”
According to the 2018-2019 
CAPS Annual Report, only about 
4 percent of appointments were 
classified as urgent or crises. Due 
to the ambiguity, many students 
feel hesitant to prioritize their 
own situation and underutilize 
the crisis services. 
At CAPS, Sevig told The Daily 
that “crisis” is based on what 
students think and does not have 
one solid meaning. 
“Some centers define (crisis) 
by the professional staff. We 
intentionally do not do that,”

It is available to students who 
applied early action and received 
a postponed decision or who 
applied regular decision, Sanders 
said. 
“For some, the Early Action 
application deadline approaches 
much sooner than anticipated 
and an opportunity to submit 
additional information now that 
the rush of the fall season has 
quieted would be welcomed,” 
Sanders 
wrote. 
“This 
short 
answer 
response 
offers 
the 
opportunity 
to 
provide 
an 
update to the initial application 
submission.”
According to the webpage, the 
decision to not consider other 
information 
from 
applicants 
is due to the high volume of 
applications. 
Nationally, 
the 
University ranked 10th for the 
number of freshman applicants, 
with 64,917 applications for 
this 
year’s 
freshman 
class. 
Approximately 23 percent of 
applicants were admitted.
A second deferred student, 
also speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said the practice of 
sending a letter of continued 
interest, which was largely an 
unspoken method for showing 
commitment, was a way to 
distinguish 
themselves 
from 
the rest of the applicant pool. 
Because it is now a form available 
to all applicants, the student feels 
they may have lost an edge they 
previously would have had with 
sending the letter.

“I know some people are 
annoyed because this is another 
essay and it’s extra work when 
they’ve already put so much into 
the application, but to me, for 
someone who sees this as their 
top school, it’s more of another 
opportunity for me to show them 
I’m committed,” the applicant 
said. “It’s an opportunity that 
I’m grateful for, but I do think 
it’s interesting that it’s not this 
under-the-radar thing that it was 
in the past.”
The student said the change 
from a letter to an essay removed 
some of the individuality. She also 
noted the possibility for overlap 
with the 500-word application 
essay, which asks students to 
“describe the unique qualities 
that attract you to the specific 
undergraduate College or School 
(including preferred admission 
and dual degree programs) to 
which you are applying at the 
University of Michigan” and 
how the curriculum supports the 
applicant’s interests.
The 
student 
was 
also 
frustrated with the language 
of 
the 
form, 
which 
says 
additional communication will 
not be considered. However, 
after 
talking 
with 
teachers, 
the student said she is still 
considering sending in additional 
information, such as an extra 
letter of recommendation.
Sanders wrote that the change 
levels the playing field for 
applicants because it provides 
guidance for what the University 
would like to see. Previously, 
there would be a large variation 
in what the admissions staff 

received from applicants, so 
this 
change 
provides 
more 
information about what they will 
and will not consider.
“Historically, our Early Action 
applicants who are not admitted 
in Early Action, as well as some 
Regular 
Decision 
applicants, 
have 
attempted 
to 
provide 
further 
information 
about 
themselves after their application 
is submitted, and we did not 
provide 
standard 
guidance 
regarding how to do so,” Sanders 
wrote. “The quantity and quality 
of the information submitted 
varied greatly and follow-up 
with students was inefficient and 
cumbersome. 
This 
additional 
short answer response allows 
for an equitable experience for 
all applicants who desire to send 
additional 
information 
after 
their application is completed, 
and provides guidance for the 
submission of that information.”
Christopher Kasper, a school 
counselor at Ann Arbor Pioneer 
High School, is grateful for 
this clarity. He said students 
in previous years were unsure 
of what to do after receiving 
a 
postponed 
decision 
from 
the University. He said this 
form 
gives 
applicants 
more 
information on the next steps 
they can take.
“What it does is it helps guide 
and direct students to know what 
their next step is and to know 
that they have this opportunity,” 
Kasper said. “I think students 
appreciate the opportunity and 
the clarity and are more than 
willing and enthusiastic about 
the additional short essay.”

The talk proceeded to cover 
recent events in Iran, such as the 
assassination of Iranian Major 
General Qasem Soleimani by the 
United States. The presenters 
mentioned that the “liberal media” 
was not commenting on Iran’s 
initial attack against the U.S. 
“A lot of liberal media, they 

don’t tell you that they attacked us 
first before we attacked them and 
assassinated their top general,” 
Zhu said “But basically what 
happened is that they attacked a 
military base, killing a lot of U.S. 
citizens and Iraqis, and then we 
retaliated and assassinated a top 
general, and then so, that was when 
tensions began.”
Zhu also assessed the reaction of 
Republicans to the assassination. 
“Republicans largely agree with 

what’s happening, because they 
attacked us first and we need to 
retaliate,” Zhu said.
Student activists on campus 
have advocated against military 
involvement in Iran. At a rally on 
Monday, hundreds gathered to 
voice their opposition to starting 
another war in the Middle East.
Public 
Policy 
senior 
Arwa 
Gayar, president of the Arab 
Student Association, spoke at 
the demonstration. She said she 

was concerned for the safety of 
members of her community.
“I already see members of my 
community questioning if they 
can return back to their home and 
see their families in the coming 
months,” Gayar said. “Many of us … 
are already forced to leave our own 
home countries, due to the U.S. 
history of imperialism, American 
wars in the Middle East and 
legacies of colonialism. We now 
find the security of our families 

unknown once more.”
Resnick ended the talk with a 
comment on U.S. intervention in 
Iran. 
“I’ll talk about why people 
think Iraq failed. Here’s why: 
democratization,” Resnick said. 
“Democratization is not the best 
way to go about regime change… 
Unlike Iraq, Iran still had lineage, 
descendants of Mohammed Shah 
where we can actually put in place 
of the Ayatollah.”

LSA freshman Vince Tedrick 
attended the meeting. He said 
he thinks that these College 
Republicans meetings help him 
stay 
informed 
about 
current 
events. 
“We want to look at both sides 
of the issue, we try to look at 
where everybody’s coming from,” 
Tedrick said. “And I think it helps 
us be more knowledgeable about 
the world around us and what’s 
happening.”

In an interview with The 
Daily 
last 
week, 
Gordon-
Hagerty said her time at the 
University is the source of her 
expertise, more so than any of 
her professional roles.
“Obviously, the foundation 
of my career in math and 
science 
and 
in 
national 
security and in the technical 
expertise that I hold is a 
function directly of my time 
at the University of Michigan 
and my college education,” 
Gordon-Hagerty said. “There’s 
no doubt in my mind the 
expertise ... that I’ve obtained 
over the last 30 years or so in 
my career is a direct result of 
my schooling and education at 
Michigan.”
Gordon-Hagerty 
spoke 
during the event about the 
recruiting push for the NNSA, 
as 40 percent of the NNSA’s 
workforce is on a path for 
retirement. 
She 
said 
the 
administration is looking to 
develop a diverse and robust 
future workforce.
“I want to do whatever I can 

do to continue to engage with, 
and call from, the wonderful, 
brilliant brainpower that is 
obtained by attending the 
University of Michigan and 
these 
other 
colleges 
and 
universities across the United 
States,” Gordon-Hagerty said.
After 
Gordon-Hagerty 
spoke, 
a 
six-person 
panel 
shared their roles in various 
laboratories and companies 
under the NNSA, including Los 
Alamos National Laboratory, 
Sandia National Laboratories 
and 
Lawrence 
Livermore 
National Laboratory.
Erik Timpson, an engineer 
at 
Kansas 
City 
National 
Security Campus, emphasized 
working for the public sector 
means serving the country 
while having the resources 
to turn “some of the things in 
your imagination into reality.”
“It sounds super fancy to 
be working with doctors on 
cutting-edge national research 
that’s changing the way that 
we look at security and how 
secure we are,” Timpson said. 
“You guys are like, ‘Man, I’m 
just fresh out of calculus and 
physics. I don’t know if I’m 
ready for that yet.’ The simple 

answer is: You are. You’re 
totally ready. You can do this.”
Gordon-Hagerty 
advised 
current 
undergraduates 
to 
recognize 
the 
importance 
of national security, to be 
flexible with career plans as 
opportunities arise and to not 
rule out any possibilities early 
on.
“The advice I would give to 
current and future applicants 
to 
our 
nuclear 
security 
enterprises is keeping an open 
mind and to know their career 
will grow in the future,” 
Gordon-Hagerty said. 
Rackham 
student 
Jeff 
Woolstrum, who is currently 
pursuing a Ph.D. in nuclear 
engineering, 
said 
he 
was 
fascinated by the University’s 
relevance in national security.
“It was great that (U-M) 
has the kind of pull to bring 
in these high-level people,” 
Woolstrum 
said. 
“There 
were a lot of good questions 
and a lot of good answers 
that were asked and a lot of 
good resources that are just 
so conveniently available to 
everybody here at Michigan.”

Detroit needs better public transit

D

etroit 
has 
long 
been 
known 
for 
its 
production 
of 
automobiles, 
but 
the 
city’s reliance on cars for 
transportation has become 
its Achilles’ heel. That was 
not always the case. At the 
end of World War II, Detroit 
had a public transit system 
of streetcars, buses and a 
commuter rail that had an 
annual 
ridership 
of 
490 
million. Today that number 
is 36 million. The city needs 
reinvestment 
in 
public 
transportation to make travel 
easier for those currently 
living in the city and to 
attract talent to the region. 
From 1950 to 2010, the 
city 
population 
dwindled 
from 1.85 million to 710,000. 
The 
surrounding 
suburbs 
exploded as a result and 
today the population of the 
entire metropolitan area is 
around 4 million. This has 
led to massive urban sprawl. 
As Angie Schmitt wrote for 
Streetsblog, “Homes in the 
central city were abandoned 
— and the tax revenues that 
came from those households 
evaporated. Detroit, unlike 
some of its wealthy suburbs 
in Oakland County, only saw 
one side of this migration — 
the losing side. And it was 
poorly equipped to deal with 
the fallout.”
The typical commute for 
Detroit workers is 10.4 miles, 
one of the longest in the 
nation. And despite Detroit’s 
label as “The Motor City”, a 
quarter of its residents don’t 
own cars. Aggravating this 
issue is the fact that 77 percent 
of jobs in Metro Detroit 
lie outside the city center. 
These issues overwhelmingly 
impact people of color and 
women; 40 percent of Black 

residents and 43 percent of 
women do not own cars.
Workers who don’t have 
cars are forced to use two bus 
systems, one for the city and 
one for the suburbs. The city 
bus system has been plagued 
by unreliability and was given 
an F rating in 2011. Most 
of the suburban bus routes 
don’t go into the city, and 
the ones that do can’t pick up 
riders inside city limits due 
to an old city ordinance. This 
complicated and unconnected 
system is a headache for 
workers who live in the city 
but work in the suburbs.

Some have argued in the 
past that Detroit wouldn’t 
be able to handle a larger 
transportation 
system 
because they were failing 
to 
maintain 
the 
current 
one, but there are signs of 
hope. Detroit’s bus ridership 
increased over the past two 
years, which goes against 
the trend of falling ridership 
nationwide. 
And 
in 
2019, 
76 percent of buses were on 
time as compared to just 50 
percent in 2011.
A unified bus system for 
southeast 
Michigan 
would 
help solve some of these 
issues. 
Ideally, 
it 
would 
be a rail system, but the 
Southeastern 
Michigan 
Regional Transit Authority’s 

rules make it difficult to have 
a rail system approved. After 
a 2016 proposal for public 
transportation 
failed, 
the 
issue has once again been 
revived as a possible 2020 
ballot proposal.
Economically, 
it 
makes 
sense. Every $1 we invest 
in 
public 
transportation 
generates $4 in economic 
return. A $1 billion investment 
in 
public 
transportation 
generates an estimated 21,000 
jobs. When Detroit failed to 
make the cut for Amazon’s 
final HQ2 list, one of the 
reasons cited was lack of mass 
transit. So-called business-
friendly Republicans in the 
Detroit suburbs have loved 
to wage war against public 
transportation and it has only 
hurt southeast Michigan. 
Metro 
Detroit 
desperately 
needs better public transit. In 
2015 a Detroit man went viral 
for his 21-mile daily commute 
on foot to work, which was 
put to an end when a local car 
dealership gifted him a Ford 
Taurus. There are 66,000 other 
households in Detroit without 
a car and they cannot rely on 
becoming an internet sensation 
to solve their transportation 
problems. A proposed rail link 
between Ann Arbor and Detroit 
would make the talent pool 
from the University of Michigan 
more accessible to companies in 
Detroit. The Regional Transit 
Authority plan should be on the 
ballot for 2020. Everyone who 
can vote for it should. Even if you 
do not use public transportation, 
there are plenty of people who 
will, and economically it benefits 
everyone.

Trump’s challenge to the environment, economy and states’ rights
U

nder 
the 
Trump 
administration’s 
destruction 
of 
environmental regulations, 
we have seen the deregulation 
of water, air pollution and 
emission 
standards. 
We 
have seen deregulation of 
natural resource extraction 
all 
under 
the 
guise 
of 
proposed economic benefit. 
In this vein, the Trump 
administration 
recently 
proposed a cut to Obama-
era fuel efficiency standards 
combined with a challenge 
of states’ rights to combat 
these 
deregulations. 
This 
ill-advised decision would 
create a division in the 
American 
auto 
industry, 
driving up car prices, hurting 
the average consumer and 
continuing to disregard the 
environment. 
This 
policy 
should not be enacted. 
In 2012, Former President 
Barack 
Obama 
met 
with 
leaders of the American auto 
industry and worked with 
them to set ambitious fuel 
efficiency standards of 54.5 
miles per gallon by 2025. 
However, President Donald 
Trump is now proposing a 
slash of these standards, 
setting them at 37 miles per 
gallon. The EPA proposal 
also revoked a legal waiver 
granted to California under 
the 1970 Clean Air Act, 
which is now followed by 
13 other states, permitting 
individual states to set their 
own pollution standards that 
are more strict than those 
of the federal government. 
Important figures in the 
EPA and the Department 
of 
Transportation 
claim 
increased 
fuel 
efficiency 
standards 
conflict 
with 
driver safety due to the 
promotion of lighter cars.
However, 
the 
Trump 
administration is completely 
missing 
the 
point. 
Yes, 
cars 
are 
getting 
lighter, 
but material science and 
engineering 
have 
also 
improved and vehicles have 
been able to maintain safety 
standards. 
John 
DeCicco, 
PhD., 
Associate 
Director 
and Research Professor at 
the University of Michigan 
Energy Institute, explains 
“the 
administration’s 
efforts to roll back these 
standards is a denial of 
basic science and a denial 
of 
American 
automakers’ 
engineering 
capabilities 

and ingenuity.” Meanwhile, 
a consumer report on the 
topic 
clearly 
refutes 
the 
claim of consumer benefit, 
affirming consumers would 
have to spend an estimated 
$55 billion more total on gas 
in 2040.
Clearly, 
any 
proposed 
benefits of the plan have been 
refuted by basic data and 
science. The administration 
simply picked facts out of 
context 
to 
bolster 
their 
claims. 
But 
maybe 
the 
American auto industry will 
benefit? Wrong. 
Despite these cuts to fuel 
efficiency standards, states 
like California are looking 
to maintain their own fuel 
standards and ignore the 
federal cuts. If this occurred, 
the 
American 
automobile 
market would be effectively 
split into two: one market 
for less efficient cars and 
one for more efficient cars. 
Automakers have called this 
the worst-case scenario as 
their production would be 
less cost-effective. To avoid 
two separate markets, either 
the 
federal 
government 
needs 
to 
adhere 
to 
the 
standards set in 2012, or 
California needs to submit 

to the federal government.
American 
markets 
are 
shifting 
toward 
sustainability 
because 
they’re following demand. 
Especially 
in 
the 
auto 
industry, 
the 
issues 
of 
sustainability and economic 
benefit 
are 
no 
longer 
conflicting. It’s simple. Yet 
Trump is still pursuing the 
deregulation, including the 
revocation of states’ rights 
to fit his ill-advised agenda.
The 
Republican 
party 
is well known for their 
staunch advocacy of states’ 
rights. Recent nationwide 
legislative 
and 
judicial 
proposals on issues such as 
same-sex marriage, abortion 

and gun control have been 
rejected by the Republican 
party because of their belief 
in states’ rights. This isn’t 
to say that the Republican 
party 
doesn’t 
believe 
in 
the 
right 
to 
abortion, 
stricter gun laws or same-
sex marriage. Rather, the 
Republican stance has been 
to let states decide what laws 
they want to enact or omit as 
a representation of what the 
electorate believes or wants. 
But suddenly, when it comes 
to the agenda of the Trump 
administration, 
states’ 
rights are out the window. 
The hypocrisy reeks. At the 
very least, each state should 
be able to set their own 
standards at more ambitious 
levels in spite of our utterly 
inept federal government’s 
response 
to 
the 
climate 
crisis. But even this right is 
not afforded.
If 
the 
Trump 
administration were to go 
ahead with this proposal, 
states’ 
rights 
would 
be 
infringed upon, consumers 
would be forced to spend 
more, the American auto 
industry would suffer at 
the hands of a split market 
and 
the 
environment 
would 
suffer. 
Less 
fuel 
efficiency 
means 
more 
gas 
consumption, 
leaving 
oil companies as the only 
significant 
beneficiary. 
Trump’s 
inauguration 
festivities received millions 
from the fossil fuel industry, 
no doubt in exchange for 
favors from the president 
such as this repeal of fuel 
efficiency standards.
While 
politicians 
are 
lounging comfortably in the 
deep pockets of the fossil 
fuel 
industry, 
consumers, 
American automakers and 
the 
environment 
are 
all 
suffering. This proposal is 
one of many deregulations 
in the Trump administration 
that 
set 
a 
dangerous 
precedent 
for 
the 
future 
of American politics and 
our environment. Plain and 
simple, this proposal says 
that the economic success 
of big companies is more 
important than states’ rights 
and more important than the 
economic well-being of the 
majority of the people in this 
country.

DAVID LISBONNE | OP-ED

Did the University forget about the first amendment?
L

egislators 
at 
every 
level 
have 
adopted 
an operational ethos 
of “ignore all relevant laws 
and sign it.” This is a deeply 
concerning trend, and one 
that will result in dystopian 
realizations 
as 
politics 
continue 
moving 
toward 
the extremes. However, my 
fragile hope for the future 
remains intact thanks to the 
courts’ consistent rejection 
of this ethos. The University 
of Michigan is only the latest 
subject of both this trend 
and justices ruling in a case 
concerning our most potent 
liberty: speech.
On 
May 
2, 
2018, 
the 
University 
was 
sued 
by 
Speech First, an organization 
dedicated to upholding the 
First Amendment on college 
campuses. 
The 
subject 
of 
the legal dispute was the 
University’s Bias Response 
Team (BRT), which, according 
to 
Speech 
First, 
stifled 
freedom of speech and was 
therefore 
unconstitutional. 
In September 2019, the Sixth 
Circuit 
Court 
of 
Appeals 
ruled that the BRT “acts 
by way of implicit threat of 
punishment and intimidation 
to quell speech,” and the 
University agreed to disband 
the BRT. This case is hugely 
symbolic, more so than it may 
appear.
The most basic freedom 
belonging to each person is 
life, defined by their freedom 
of conscience. Both life and 
free conscience are impossible 
to 
breach 
without 
direct 
action perpetrated by one unto 
another. Freedom of speech, 
therefore, is the concretization 
of our freedom of conscience. 
And fundamentally, this is why 
Speech First v. Schlissel is so 
symbolic: The courts defended 
our most basic right. 
No student at the University 

should ever feel discriminated 
against. Yet, while the BRT 
held this same belief as its 
cornerstone, 
the 
metric 
used 
to 
determine 
if 
an 
offense had occurred - the 
University’s anti-harassment 
policy - did not offer any 
objective 
definitions 
as 
to 
what 
constituted 
a 
violation. 
And 
here 
lies 
the 
unconstitutionality, 
as 
described 
by 
the 
Department of Justice: “The 
University imposes a system 
of 
arbitrary 
censorship 
of, 
and 
punishment 
for, 
constitutionally 
protected 
speech.”

This broader conflict is 
not unique to the University. 
Colleges across the country 
face similar challenges in 
trying to secure welcoming 
campus environments without 
infringing 
upon 
students’ 
First 
Amendment 
rights. 
In 
this, 
I’m 
sympathetic 
with the universities. We’re 
riding a 50-year wave of 
legal victories for equality 
in a number of areas; so, in 
keeping with the trend, let’s 
try to fix campus speech, 
right? Sure, but not like this.
Today’s political climate is 
one of friction and frustration 
on both sides. Any comment 
not perfectly impartial sets 
off a firestorm, regardless 
of 
the 
reasoning 
behind 
the statement, the context 

or the speaker. We are on 
a hair trigger. So, how, in 
this era so characterized by 
scrutinizing the most minute 
actions and verbiage, did the 
University fly right by the 
First Amendment?
Sadly, today, the legitimacy 
of actions taken in pursuit of 
something noble are largely 
ignored. 
Those 
in 
charge 
act 
impulsively 
without 
considering their actions. The 
University wanted to create 
a safer campus climate, so it 
created an agency capable of 
implicitly punishing students 
who voiced opinions that 
offended others. To me, this 
sounds like a paragon of this 
trend, a laudable end to be 
achieved by censorship. And 
the courts said no. 
At last, herein lies my 
optimism for the fate of 
America: 
the 
judiciary. 
Currently, 
it 
seems 
the 
shared methodology to enact 
change, among both parties, 
is to act now and consider 
legality later. And yet, the 
courts have stood tall. The 
Department of Justice filed 
a lawsuit against the state 
of California for violating 
Article 1, Section 10; a federal 
judge 
blocked 
Alabama’s 
abortion ban; and the Sixth 
Circuit 
Court 
of 
Appeals 
ruled against the University’s 
Bias 
Response 
Team. 
This 
case 
was 
altogether 
important and worrying, but I 
find its conclusion reassuring 
for the future. The courts 
remain the protectors of our 
fundamental rights amidst 
brazen violations, and it looks 
like they might just continue 
holding the torch even if 
legislators at every level keep 
trying to blow it out.

I think the phrase “lightning 
in a bottle” is overused. So, know 
that when I call Greta Gerwig’s 
“Little Women” lightning in a 
bottle, understand that I mean 
it in the most life-altering, soul-
affirming way. “Little Women” 
is a rush of wonder and youth, 
containing a kind of emotional 
depth that I search for in every 
movie. To boil its infectious and 
unforgettable zeal down to a 
single moment would do injustice 
do its living, breathing charm. So 
instead, we wrote about several 
moments. Ones that made us 
cry, or laugh or simply stare 
in wonder at the screen. Our 
favorite moments. Caution: this 
list includes important spoilers 
from “Little Women.”

Jo and Laurie dance
 
Greta 
Gerwig 
is 
a 
time 
traveler.
Gerwig’s 
“Little 
Women” 
is 
disarmingly, 
refreshingly 
modern. The potent themes of 

Alcott’s novel aren’t diluted by 
the period dresses and period 
slang, instead they become 
timeless.
As for the moment: Two 
wallflowers find themselves 
together in a side room at a 
local party. Not dancing doesn’t 
seem right. Dancing in there 
seems even worse. They waltz, 
spin and shake their hearts 
out on the wrap-around porch 
of the colonial New England 
home. It’s Gerwig’s first nod 
to the little worlds we find 
with the people we love. Jo and 
Laurie move like they’re at a 
punk show in the 1970s — like 
they’re two kids who’ve found 
who they want to dance with 
for the first time.

Amy burns Jo’s book

Eleven 
months 
before 
I 
started college, I began writing 
a novel, and by the beginning 
of my freshman year, I had 
generated some 50,000 words. 
It’s no wonder that I find the 
most affecting scene in “Little 
Women” to be Amy’s burning 
of Jo’s book. The pointed ease 
with which Amy decides to 
burn the pages is as upsetting 

as Jo’s reaction to the absence 
of her work when she arrives 
after the party. Her realization 
that those pages are gone made 
me feel a rageful, incapacitating 
grief. It was the first of many 
times I shed tears during “Little 
Women,” because sometimes, 
losing your work can feel 
like losing a person, a part of 
yourself that you will never see 
again.

Mr. Lawrence listens to Beth 
play the piano

Every Sunday, I trek to my 
friend’s apartment, and we 
drive to the grocery store. 
He and his roommates have 
a piano, and often, when I 
approach the door, I can hear 
him playing. Usually, instead of 
entering, I just lean against the 
door, close my eyes and listen 
until he stops. It’s beautiful and 
I can’t bring myself to interrupt 
it.
In “Little Women,” the March 
sisters’ next-door neighbor, Mr. 
Lawrence, decides to show the 
same restraint. Having given 
Beth March an open invitation 
to use the piano that his late 
daughter used to play, she 

performs in solitude with a 
dexterity and certainty that 
her shyness often obscures. In 
one scene, Mr. Lawrence hears 
her, descends the stairs, then, 
instead of sauntering in and 
disrupting her serenity, he — an 
elderly man — crouches down 
on the steps, content just to 
listen. Some beauty asks us to 
participate. Some we can only 
witness.

Arts Editor

The 
March 
sisters 
admit 
Laurie 
into 
their 
theatre 
troupe

Greta 
Gerwig 
intimately 
understands the love language 
of youth — it’s active, usally 
made complete with screaming 
and laughing. The sisters and 
Laurie 
consistently 
overlap 
each 
other, 
physically 
and 
audibly. When Laurie leaps out 
of the costume rack, screaming 
out in a rugged British accent, 
the frenzy of the March sisters 
erupts in immaculate goofiness. 
The hysteria of this scene 
lingers in my mind not only 
for its encapsulation of the 
overlapping nature of youth, 
but also for the scene’s ability to 
act as the residue of Marmee’s 
teachings: 
“Do it for someone else, just 
like Marmee taught us.” 
The March sisters and Laurie 
perform for each other before 
they perform for anyone else, 
inventing roles and providing 
their 
watchful, 
attentive 
gaze to each other’s art. The 
audience is organic — it comes 
from the love of art and the love 
of each other. At the end of the 
scene, Laurie provides each 
sister with a key; In the same 
way the key allows Jo to open a 
portal back to the selfless art of 
her youth, Greta uses this scene 
to open a portal into a world 
where you first came to art for 
the love of it, acting without 
thought 
of 
consequences, 
sidegigs, or career ambitions. 
The dainty flowers hanging 
delicately overhead remind us 
that one can be just Jo, not Ms. 
March. One can be just Laurie, 
not Mr. Laurence.

Jo and Beth at the beach 

“It’s like the tide going out. It 

goes out slowly, but it can’t be 
stopped.”
“I’ll stop it.”
This scene, to me, embodies 
the very best of Jo March: her 
determination, her devotion, 
her naive, romantic belief in the 
notion that love conquers all, 
even death. Of course, anyone 
who has read the book or seen 
the film knows that Beth’s 
death could not be stopped, not 
even by Jo’s fierce, undying love 
for her. When Jo tells her sister 
she will stop her death, her 
voice quivers, yet there is still 
an undeniable, unexplainable 
strength 
in 
her 
speech, 
a 
strength that seems to comfort 
Beth, regardless of whether or 
not she actually believes in Jo’s 
words. And though they both 
secretly understand that Beth’s 
time on earth is limited, in this 
one brief and precious moment 
on the beach, braced against 
the Atlantic ocean’s harsh and 
unforgiving wind, Beth is safe, 
held in her sister’s arms.

Amy and Laurie in the art 
studio

I read “Little Women” for the 
first time when I was eight, and 
I hated Amy. I read it again a few 
weeks ago, and I still didn’t love 
her. It wasn’t until I watched 
Florence Pugh onscreen as Amy 
March that I truly appreciated 
her. The one scene in particular 
that changed my mind about 
her was when she stands up 
to Laurie in her art studio, 
refusing to be looked down 
upon for her decision to marry 
rich. She tells him point blank 
that marriage is “an economic 
proposition” for women and 
makes him understand just 
how difficult life is for women 
of the time. In this moment, she 
proves that she has no regrets 
in doing what she has to do to 
minimize that difficulty in her 
own life. That moment, that 
scene, is where we finally see 
bratty Amy March, who wears 
fairy wings and burns books, 
morph into a confident, grown 
woman.

Mr. Lawrence can’t bring 
himself to enter the March 
house without Beth in it

“Little Women” has always 
been a story about vitality and 
youth, not just as an abstraction 
or an era in people’s lives, but 
as a physically occupied space. 
In the girls’ teenage years, 
the 
March 
house 
crackles 
with signs of life and youth 
everywhere: The soft yellow 
light, the little cut-out stars 
dangling from the ceiling, the 
strewn-about 
blankets 
and 
jackets. When Beth has her 
whole life ahead of her, her 
music and her potential and 
the kind things she says fill the 
March house. When she dies, 
it’s like a vortex takes over, 
sucking all the light in the world 
with it. The movie goes from 
being lit in pinks and yellows 
to greys and blues. When we 
talk about death we talk about 
it as a “loss,” and it’s true that 
something fundamental about 
the space these characters live 
in is lost when Beth dies. Her 
life and her presence didn’t just 
belong to her. It filled her world, 
and the world of everyone who 
knew her. Mr. Lawrence is 
right — a March house without 
Beth is impossible to fathom. 
Their home is a foreign country 
now.

Becher,

The 
costumes. 
That’s 
it. 
That’s the blurb. 

Period films always have 
good costumes. Some are better 
than others, obviously, but the 
starting point is the same. After 
listening to Greta Gerwig talk 
about the thought and detail 
that went into the costumes, it’s 
unsurprising that the wardrobe 
in “Little Women” is one of the 
best to hit theaters. 
Each 
character’s 
style 
is 
distinctly theirs — Jo runs 
around 
in 
pants 
and 
an 
inspiring green writing jacket 
that make you yearn to write 
alongside her. Amy, Meg and 
Beth are seen in a variety of 
dresses, scarves and overcoats 
that reflect each girl’s desire to 
fit in with her classmates, keep 
up with her richer counterparts 
or endlessly play piano. Not 
only that, their styles evolve 
as Gerwig takes her audience 
between the rosy memories of 
childhood to the sophisticated 
air that is the present.

The best moments from 
‘Little Women’: A tribute

SONY PICTURES RELEASING

FILM NOTEBOOK
FILM NOTEBOOK

DAILY ARTS WRITERS
Daily Arts Writers

“Music Talks” is a series where 
Daily Music Writers give their 
takes on the biggest releases in 
new music. From picking best 
and worst tracks to asking what 
makes a record tick, the Music 
beat is here to give praise and 
give shit to music worth talking 
about.
On Oct. 11, when Harry Styles 
dropped “Lights Up,” his first 
single in almost two years, the 
pop music sphere exploded in 
anticipation of Fine Line. Styles 
told Rolling Stone the album 
was about “having sex and 
feeling sad.” Well, all the 12–14 
year-old One Direction fans 
that were stanning Harry Styles 
in 2012 are all grown up. That 
demographic is all about having 
sex and feeling sad now — or at 
least joking about those things 
on Twitter — so the subject 
matter couldn’t be more perfect. 
Tack that on to all Styles’ 
talk 
of 
taking 
psychedelics 
during the recording process, 
and this record is a recipe for 
late-Millennial/early-Gen-Z 
euphoria. But does it live up to 
the hype? The Music beat broke 
it down.
This transcript has been edited 
and condensed for clarity.
Dylan Yono, Daily Arts 
Writer: OK, let’s start with 
the basics. What did you think 
of the album? Is it better than 
his debut?
Clara 
Scott, 
Daily 
Arts 
Writer: I was a big fan of the 
album. A lot of people have very 
lackluster sophomore albums 
— you spend your entire life 
working on your first album and 
you come up with the second 

in three years — but this one is 
really amazing. I would argue 
that it’s better than his debut, 
the variety in this album is 
impressive. He did so much 
more than the sad-boy rock 
thing he did on his first album.
Sam Cantie, Daily Music 
Editor: I’m gonna have to 
disagree with Clara Scott over 
here. I thought that this was 
not even close to as good as his 
first. His lyrics got cheesy and 
simplified, it felt a little bit like 
I was reading some Hallmark 
cards. And he can do that 
because he’s Harry Styles and 
he’s creating more of a persona 
on this album than focusing on 
the music itself. 
Jim 
Wilson, 
Daily 
Arts 
Writer: Yeah, I think it was 
kinda like a 46-minute car 
commercial 
soundtrack. 
I 
thought I was gonna like it but it 
didn’t quite come through.
Katie Beekman, Daily Arts 
Writer: Wow, I’m more on 
Clara’s side here. I liked the first 
half a lot, but the second half fell 
kinda flat for me. In his Zane 
Lowe interview, he talked about 
taking more risks on this album 
and that really came through 
in terms of genre blending and 
having big moments, so I was 
impressed.
Jonah Mendelson, Senior 
Arts Editor: I agree with Katie 
that the first half was better 
than the second half. I thought 
it was really enjoyable, and I 
liked the singles, and “Golden” 
was really successful. But I 
think the whole thing was kinda 
inconsequential. A lot of the 
risks he took — I’m borrowing 
a phrase from John Lennon 
here — it’s like fancy wrapping 
around an empty box.
Best and worst track?
Scott: My favorite is hands 

down “Lights Up.” It’s so good. 
It was the best first single he 
could’ve released. I agree with 
Katie and Jonah that the singles 
on the first half of the album are 
the best here. Especially “Lights 
Up” because it’s so atmospheric 
and beautiful and it doesn’t have 
a traditional song structure 
which I really appreciate.
Cantie: I’m gonna say worst 
track is “Treat People With 
Kindness,” and I know it’s kind 
of villainy of me to say —
(all laughing)
Wilson: I didn’t even get that 
far, I got to track 10 and was like, 
skip.
Cantie: — what I was saying 
earlier about the Hallmark-card 
writing was most apparent on 
“Treat People With Kindness.” 
I’d say my favorite track is 
“Adore You,” because to bounce 
off what Jonah was saying, it 
feels like the fanciest wrapping 
paper. The singles are the best, 
but Harry put out this kind of 
sugary, 
pink-and-blue 
candy 
vibe with them and then kinda 
left those colors there with 
the singles and didn’t follow 
through on the aesthetic for the 
whole album.
Wilson: Least favorite track 
is 
definitely 
“Watermelon 
Sugar.” That song was dumb. My 
favorite was “To Be So Lonely,” 
the only song I listened to twice.
Beekman: I get what Sam 
was saying about the colorful 
singles and then it kind of 
fading in the second half. In 
terms of tracks, I feel like others 
might disagree with me but I 
really liked “Cherry,” and least 
favorite is definitely “Canyon 
Moon.” There was just nothing 
there for me.
Mendelson: My favorite is 
probably “Golden.” He’s most 
successful with what he’s aiming 

for on that track. And “She” is 
his most successful foray into 
a different style. I didn’t really 
like that stretch from “Cherry” 
to “To Be So Lonely.”
In 
terms 
of 
themes, 
inspirations and styles (no 
pun intended), this album is 
all over the place. Other than 
Harry Styles, what strings 
this album together?
(silence)
Nothing is an acceptable 
answer.
Wilson: That’s what I was 
gonna say. There’s no cohesion.
Scott: I agree with Sam that 
he’s trying to put together an 
image that doesn’t necessarily 
translate into solid music. I like 
the music, but the more I think 
about it, it doesn’t connect with 
Harry Styles’s image in the way 
that he wants to build it. Where 
it’s very cinematic, but there 
might not be anything behind 
the curtain.
As a follow-up to the last 
question: Styles dabbles in 
folk, soul, funk, psychedelic 
rock and of course, pop. 
Which of those genres does he 
do worst?
Mendelson: 
I 
think 
his 
soul attempts are the worst. 
Especially when he’s just like, 
gospel choir. It’s just not good.
Scott: It’s just kinda like, 

“play that funky music white 
boy.”
Cantie: Yeah, and there are 
lyrics that express how bad that 
is too, I wrote this down: When 
he says in “Cherry,” “I miss your 
accent / I miss your friends,” 
that was just like — 
Wilson: Might be the wackest 
thing ever.
Cantie: — yeah, that was 
wack to me.
Scott: I kind of disagree, I 
think his folk attempts are the 
worst — 
Mendelson: Yeah, his folk 
attempts are bad.
Scott: — I feel like in his 
attempts at soul he’s clearly 
putting in effort to pull it off, 
but he seems to think folk is just 
like, a guy and a guitar. That’s 
part of it, but you also have to 
have a certain amount of grit 
and understanding of the genre. 
Especially on “Canyon Moon” 
where it’s just like, dude, you’re 
not Neil Young, can you chill 
out?
Beekman: 
Whatever 
he’s 
doing on “Canyon Moon” and 
“Treat People With Kindness,” 
that’s where I say “no, please 
stop doing that, we’re good.”
Mendelson: Bad lyrics really 
shine through on folk songs too.
Scott: I agree, you don’t have 
anything to hide it like you do on 

heavily produced songs. 
Which genre does he do 
best? Which would you want 
to see him lean into on the 
next record?
Scott: It’s no secret that his 
pop songs are his best songs.
Cantie: That’s why I like 
“Adore You” so much, that’s 
what he’s best at.
Mendelson: 
In 
terms 
of 
exploring his influences, he’s 
best when he’s building off that 
’70s-soft-rock-Fleetwood-Mac 
sound. There’s a lot of potential 
for future growth there.
Cantie: On Twitter when you 
see pictures of him with Stevie 
Nicks, that grabs people a lot, it 
plays into his persona. I think 
he wants that image to come 
through most.
Wilson: He’s no Stevie Nicks.
Scott: It’s in the blending of pop 
and rock that a lot of ’70s outfits did 
that he’s best at. You can call it soft 
rock, pop rock, whatever, I think 
he brings a greater sensibility to 
pop music and that makes him so 
alluring. But when he strays too far 
into bubblegum pop or too gritty 
hard rock, it gets kind of weird. He 
has a happy medium with a sound 
that bands like Fleetwood Mac did 
successfully.

WHISPER

Introducing the

WHISPER

“Birth 
control? 

I’m above 
it.”

“College 
made me 
sweaty.”

“What? I 
can’t be 
unhinged?”

The beginning of the end 
has arrived for the loving, 
joyful and witty show that is 
“Schitt’s Creek.” It may feel 
like it’s leaving our lives just 
as fast as it was introduced, 
as many of us didn’t know it 
existed until we uncovered it 
on Netflix within the last year. 
Regardless 
of 
how 
long 
we’ve 
individually 
adored 
“Schitt’s Creek,” we’re all here 
now for a final season. For 
more than five years, we have 
watched the development of 
Johnny Rose (Eugene Levy, 
“Finding 
Dory”), 
his 
wife 
Moira 
(Catherine 
O’Hara, 
“The 
Addams 
Family”), 
their adult children David 
(Dan Levy, “Admission”) and 
Alexis (Annie Murphy, “The 
Plateaus”), as they transitioned 
from their lavish lifestyles to 
one without money, where all 
they have is each other in the 
town of nothingness that is 
Schitt’s Creek. Now that the 
Roses have found their place 
in the town, this final season 
might be the last time they’re 
all together, as the premiere 
made it clear that the family’s 

lives are headed in different 
directions.
Picking up about a week 
after the events of the season 
five finale, the soap-opera 
star Moira is still in despair 

from losing the leading role in 
“The Crows Have Eyes 3: The 
Crowening.” Alexis is packing 
to leave for the Galapagos 
with Ted, while David and 
Patrick (Noah Reid, “House 
of Lies”) are looking for a 

wedding venue, and Stevie 
(Emily Hampshire, “Save Me”) 
is still trying to figure out her 
purpose in life. At face value, 
these stories will inevitably 
push the characters away from 
each other over the course 
of the season. The season 
premiere reassures us that 
despite the divergent arcs, the 
heart of the show has always 
been the family dynamic of the 
Roses.
Remember back in the day 
when Alexis and David were 
arguing 
over 
who 
should 
get 
murdered 
first? 
This 
season, with Alexis’ imminent 
departure for the Galapagos 
and 
David’s 
engagement, 
neither 
of 
them 
want 
to 
share how much they’ll miss 
each other, so they engage in 
immature bickering in a way 
that may feel a bit too familiar 
for those of us with siblings. 
It’s the kind of bickering 
where everyone but the people 
who are a part of it can sense 
the subtext. After a flight 
mishap — which results in 
Alexis not leaving for another 
month — accompanied by the 
sounds of animal slaughter 
off in the distance from a 
potential wedding venue, we 
are treated to one of the most 
hilarious 
sibling 
apologies 

ever. When pressured to say 
“I’m sorry,” David resorts to a 
roundabout way of saying so, 
eventually telling Alexis that 
he “might have overreacted, 
and for that (he is) apologetic 
and remorseful over an action 
(he) participated in.”
What is astonishing about 
“Schitt’s Creek” is how true it 
has remained to the original 
story it set out to tell. The 
decision 
by 
the 
creators 
(father-son duo Eugene and 
Dan Levy) to end the show 
after six seasons was met with 
surprise by many fans due to 
the perfection of the show. But 
the Levys are aware that what 
makes the show so special is 
its commitment to telling the 
same story it set out to tell in 
season one. Keeping it running 
for 
longer 
than 
originally 
intended 
risks 
sacrificing 
the quality storytelling that 
separates 
“Schitt’s 
Creek” 
from the rest of the family-
centric television landscape. 
It would have been impossible 
to keep the Roses all together 
in Schitt’s Creek due to the 
individual 
journeys 
each 
character must face, as their 
career paths would naturally 
take them away from the town 
that brought them all together 
in the first place. 
The season six premiere 
was not anything flashy or 
noteworthy, but a show as 
genuine as “Schitt’s Creek” 
doesn’t need to be anything 
other than itself in order to 
guarantee success. There are 
only 13 episodes left, and this 
first one reminds us how much 
we missed it in the offseason 
and how much we will miss it 
when it’s gone.

TV REVIEW
TV REVIEW

POP TV

“We wanted to create a 
good mix of performances. 
Because the subject matter in 
‘No Safety Net’ is so heavy, 
we didn’t want to have such a 
dark event to start this series 
off. We wanted it to be fun, 
you know?” SMTD senior 
Jamie Sharp said about the 
University Musical Society 
(UMS) Student Committee’s 
“No Safety Net Student Kick-
Off Party.” “No 
Safety Net” is 
UMS’ 
three-
week festival 
featuring four 
provocative 
theater 
productions 
that 
“foster 
timely 
conversations 
around 
topical social 
themes.”
“These 
performances 
are so cool and 
so relevant to 
what’s 
going 
on 
today. 
This 
year, 
the 
focuses 
are white feminism, toxic 
masculinity, 
the 
refugee 
crisis, patriotism and whistle 
blowing,” LSA senior Jacob 
Gibson, a coordinator of the 
event, said. 
Sharp, 
Gibson 
and 
the 
rest of the UMS Student 
Committee, 
have 
worked 
over the last semester to 
organize the “No Safety Net 
Kick-Off Party.” The event on 
Thursday, Jan. 16 at 7:30 p.m., 
will 
feature 
performances 
from 
U-M 
students 
and 
alumni 
across 
disciplines: 
Midnight Book Club (improv 
comedy), a.n.g.e.l.i. (hip-hop/

rap), Aldo Leopoldo Pando 
Girard (spoken word/poetry) 
and Virago (free improv/new 
music).
Taking place in the intimate 
Canterbury House, the event 
is designed to bring people 
together 
through 
multiple 
forms of art. Midnight Book 
Club is sure to ignite laughter 
throughout the room. Virago 
and a.n.g.e.l.i will perform 
unique musical acts, and Aldo 
Leopoldo 
Pando 
Girard’s 
poetry will melt hearts and 
minds. 
“When we first thought 
about who to 
ask to perform 
in 
the 
Kick-
Off series we 
tried to pick 
performances 
that 
mirrored 
the 
event,” 
Gibson 
said. 
“But then we 
realized 
that 
if people are 
actually going 
to 
attend 
(No 
Safety 
Net) we want 
them to fully 
experience 
what the shows 
have to offer, 
while they are 
watching them, 
not at the Kick-Off Event. We 
wanted Thursday evening to 
moreso create a celebration 
and fun kick-off party.”
The subject matter of the 
shows in the “No Safety 
Net” series deal with heavy 
political and social themes. 
However, the event planners 
aim to craft a bit of a lighter 
tone amongst attendees.
“People should come into 
this kick-off event with an 
excitement to see students and 
their friends perform,” Gibson 
said. “There’s no pressure! It 
will be a fun night to celebrate 
all the great theatre to come.”

‘M’ held back by bench struggles

Entering 
the 
season, 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team felt confident. 
Confident 
that 
seniors 
Akienreh Johnson and Kayla 
Robbins could step into the 
starting lineup for the first time 
and play at a high level. Confident 
that sophomores Naz Hillmon 
and Amy Dilk would continue 
to grow into program building 
blocks. Confident that a bench 
lacking in-game experience could 
supplement its starters enough to 
take down top opponents.
In non-conference play, the 
Wolverines’ bench looked up 
to the task, scoring 21.5 points 
per game. While many of those 
games were against unranked, 
mid-major opponents, the bench 
contributed 
when 
the 
team 
needed it most. 
Freshman 
center 
Izabel 
Varejão scored 5.3 points per 
game against Syracuse, Notre 
Dame and Florida State and led 
the team with 11 points against 
Eastern Michigan, a game when 
no starters finished in double 
figures. Freshman guard Michelle 
Sidor scored eight points against 
Notre Dame and seven against 
Syracuse, and was Michigan’s 
biggest threat from 3-point range 
in non-conference play, shooting 
34.2 percent. Sophomore forward 
Emily Kiser scored 10 against 
Appalachian State with junior 
forward Hailey Brown injured.
In these first 11 games, the 
Wolverines’ bench by no means 
took over games. But with five 
starters that could control a game 
on any given night, Michigan’s 
performances from the bench 
seemed 
to 
be 
enough. 
The 
Wolverines looked like a true Big 
Ten contender.
But just five games later, 
Michigan’s bench looks like the 
inexperienced group that was its 
biggest question mark entering 
the season. Outside of a blowout 
win against Penn State in which 
reserves played the majority of 

the fourth quarter, the bench has 
scored just seven points per game 
in four Big Ten games.
“Now the people that we’re 
playing 
are 
bigger, 
faster, 
stronger, and that’s a little bit 
of an adjustment, especially for 
our younger kids,” Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico said. 
“The physicality is definitely 
something that’s different, and 
the teams that we’ve played 
against, such as Maryland and 
Ohio State, are big and strong.” 
The 
Varejão 
from 
the 
beginning of the season who 
looked like a valuable scorer 
has had difficulty finding the 
basket in Big Ten play — she has 
been held to two points or less 
in four of five games. Sidor has 
struggled from deep — making 
just 4-of-15 and 1-of-12 outside 
of the Penn State game — and 
has seen her minutes decrease 
as a result. Kiser leads all bench 
players, averaging just 3.4 points 
per game.
“Our freshmen are getting 
accustomed to that change of 
strength and speed and size,” 
Barnes Arico said. “So I think that 
adjustment is gonna take a little 
bit of time. They’re working on it. 
(It’s) definitely a place where we 
need to see more production.”
While 
Barnes 
Arico 
may 
feel 
confident 
that 
all 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
reserves 
can contribute if given the 
opportunity, it can take time 
for players to adjust to new 

roles. Consistently changing the 
rotation shows the difficulty 
Barnes Arico has had finding 
contributors 
off 
the 
bench. 
Freshman guard Maddie Nolan, 
who has played sparingly all 
season and mostly in blowouts, 
was the first guard off the bench 
on Sunday.
Sunday 
against 
Maryland 
— Michigan’s worst loss of the 
season — showed the Wolverines 
just how important having a 
good bench is. None of their 
starters could get going early, 
and as the Terrapins jumped out 
to a big lead, Michigan looked for 
someone to come off the bench 
and stop the bleeding, to no avail.
Maryland, on the other hand, 
also struggled to get points from 
their stars, but its bench was 
more than capable of carrying 
the load — scoring 15 of the 
Terrapins’ 21 first-quarter points, 
and 35 total. Maryland’s ability 
to get points from its bench, and 
the Wolverines’ inability to do so, 
made the difference.
Michigan is 2-3 in Big Ten 
play — far from the top of 
the standings. But with both 
Maryland games in the rearview 
mirror and 13 games remaining, 
its goals are still well within 
reach. As good as the Wolverines’ 
starters can be, this five-game 
stretch has shown that they can 
only reach their goals if they can 
rely on the bench to score. 
In conference play, that hasn’t 
happened yet.

Michigan field athletes impress

Most 
track 
and 
field 
spectators look forward to the 
fast-paced 200-meter dash or 
the competitive 4x400-meter 
relay. However, on Saturday, 
the athletes on the inside of the 
track were the ones to watch. 
For 
Michigan, 
several 
athletes 
broke 
personal 
records in the men’s shot put, 
weight throw and pole vault, 
in addition to women’s shot 
put and high jump. At women’s 
weight throw, two throwers 
achieved their career bests and 
broke the school record.
As the only field event not 
inside the ring of the track, 
the weight throw event often 
feels isolated from the rest 
of the meet. That didn’t stop 
fifth-year Briana Nelson and 
senior Courtney Jacobsen from 
breaking the school record four 
separate times. However, when 
the event ended, Jacobsen 
emerged as the record-holder 
with a throw of 20.15 meters. 
“It’s been a year and a half 
since I’ve competed,” Jacobsen 
said. “I think it was just 
getting back into the swing 
of things and mentally being 
able to come back from injury 
and contain my excitement, 
because I was so excited to get 
back out there.” 
The other throwing event, 
the shot put, featured two first-
place finishes and two career 
bests by both the men’s and 
women’s 
teams. 
Sophomore 
Amanda Schaare threw 15.22 
meters, beating her previous 
best by over one and a half 
meters. 
Sophomore 
John 
Meyer threw 18.79 meters, 
edging out his previous best by 
just 0.04 meters. 
The 
Wolverines 
earned 
another 
first 
place 
finish 
from sophomore Eric Harris 
in the pole vault. Harris beat 
his career indoor best by 0.6 
meters with a height of 4.75 
meters. 

At 
women’s 
high 
jump, 
two senior jumpers — Jada 
Wimberly 
and 
Katt 
Miner 
— beat their career bests. 
Wimberly jumped a height of 
1.75 meters and Miner jumped 
a height of 1.8 meters, which 
also beat the meet record by 
0.02 meters. 
“(Miner) 
certainly 
has 
shown signs of being ready 
to jump well and this was a 
great opener for her, for sure,” 
jumping coach Jenny Ashcroft 
said. “Jada has 
had 
a 
couple 
years 
off 
of 
competition so 
for her to come 
out in her first 
competitive 
meet in a while 
was 
really 
spectacular. 
We’re 
really 
excited for her 
to be able to do 
that.”
Added Miner: “Me and Jada 
wanted to be really relaxed 
today and not stressed about 
anything. Our goal was just 
to make bar and just try to be 
consistent. And it just went 
way better than we both 
expected, but I think that’s just 
because we weren’t stressed 
about height or anything at all 

today.”
Wimberly 
and 
Miner 
finished 
third 
and 
first, 
respectively. In between jumps 
they continued to look to 
each other and their coaching 
staff 
for 
reassurance 
and 
encouragement.
“I think a lot of it was that 
we were doing well so just kind 
of like ‘keep doing that, keep 
the bar up, keep your shoulder 
away from the bar,’ ” Miner 
said of her coach’s support. 
“Normally, 
when 
we’re 
doing well she 
doesn’t try to 
tweak 
a 
lot, 
but 
just 
gave 
us 
positive 
reinforcement 
and 
tried 
to 
keep our heads 
level.”
Saturday’s 
meet 
was 
a 
non-scored 
event, but the results of the 
field events are good signs for 
the future meets of the indoor 
season. Although what’s going 
on in the middle of the track is 
not always the most glamorous 
to 
watch, 
Michigan’s 
field 
event athletes on Saturday 
showed just how exciting they 
can be.

Hoosiers sunk

With Michigan reeling from 
back-to-back wins by Indiana 
swimmers, it needed a boost. 
Senior 
Tommy 
Cope 
gave 
the Wolverines a win and a 
momentum shift in the 200-
yard breaststroke. Cope nudged 
the Hoosiers’ Mohamed Samy 
Hassan by 0.93 seconds and 
helped narrow the deficit to only 
one point, 104-103. 
The win helped spur the No. 3 
Michigan men’s swimming team 
(4-1 overall, 2-1 Big Ten) to a 160-
140 victory over No. 5 Indiana 
(6-3, 2-1) on Saturday morning.
“I knew that I couldn’t slip 
up or make any mistakes,” 
Cope said. “Because it’s a pretty 
crucial turning point in the meet. 
I knew that the other Michigan 
guys would be right there with 
me so you have to relax going 
into it. We just relaxed going into 
it and didn’t freak out too much. 
We knew how to do it and kind 
of started the ball rolling again 
for us.”
Michigan 
jumped 
out 
to 
an early lead with wins in the 
200-yard medley relay and the 
1000-yard freestyle, but Indiana 
started to chip away beginning 
with the 200-yard freestyle, 
which Hassan won by a matter 
of millimeters — touching the 
wall just 0.03 seconds before 
sophomore Patrick Callan did. 
The Wolverines responded 
in the chaotic 50-yard freestyle. 
Junior Luiz Gustavo Borges 
edged two Hoosiers’ swimmers 
to 
momentarily 
stop 
the 
bleeding. 
But 
Indiana 
kept 
fighting back, winning the 100-
yard freestyle and 200-yard 
backstroke to take its first lead, 
before Cope’s performance in the 
200-yard breaststroke changed 
the momentum. 
Cope got some help from 
his teammates in the 500-yard 
freestyle, where Michigan swept 
the top three spots in the race 
and retook the lead, 119-107, in 
a sequence that electrified the 

crowd.
Senior 
Miles 
Smachlo 
continued the hot streak with 
a win in the 100-yard butterfly 
over 
the 
Hoosiers’ 
Brendan 
Burns, avenging an earlier loss to 
Burns in the 200-yard butterfly.
“Seeing 
everyone else on 
the team step up I 
really bought into 
that 
mentality.” 
Smachlo 
said, 
“You see people 
like 
Tommy 
(Cope) overcome 
Mohamed 
Samy 
in the (200) IM 
after losing to him 
earlier in the year. 
You see Patrick (Callan) stepping 
up. You see Eric Storms stepping 
up. I wanted to also kinda step up 
so I had a lot more energy to fight 
for that one and get my hand on 
the wall for the team.”
Indiana was able to come in 

first in the last event, a 400-
yard relay. However, the gap still 
widened because the Wolverines 
placed in three out of the top five 
positions. The comeback victory 
was even more noteworthy after 
a loss earlier in the season in 
Bloomington.
“We 
wanted to win 
absolutely,” 
Michigan 
coach 
Mike 
Bottom 
said. 
“But even going 
into the meet 
my take was, 
‘Look these two 
teams are really 
good 
right, 
they’re really good and if we 
don’t win it’s OK, but we need to 
get better, we need improvement, 
we need to fight all the way 
through.’ So we fought all the 
way through and we won, which 
is a bonus.”

Teams can be made up in 
many different ways. Some 
are led by stars; others are 
driven by their depth, getting 
contributions from many.
The 
Michigan 
women’s 
swimming and diving team 
(4-0 overall, 2-0 Big Ten) 
demonstrated it has elements 
of both, as it defeated the 
15th-ranked 
Hoosiers 
(3-4, 
0-1), 186-114, in a dual meet on 
Saturday.
Sophomore Olivia Carter led 
the way for the Wolverines, 
making her second competitive 
appearance for Michigan after 
recently 
becoming 
eligible. 
Carter won all three individual 
events she took part in, and was 
a member of the medley relay 
team that took first.
The stands were packed, 

and the energy in Canham 
Natatorium was overwhelming. 
The environment and support 
helped 
several 
Wolverines 
compete at maximum intensity, 
something that is sometimes 
missing 
from 
a 
midseason 
meet.
“The energy was amazing,” 
Carter said. “It was loud, and I 
was so happy to be there. … The 
stands were packed, which I’ve 
never really experienced that 
before, and it was awesome. I 
felt really supported, everyone 
was so happy and encouraging, 
and it helped me be the best 
swimmer I could be for the 
team.”
Michigan coach Mike Bottom 
noticed the impact Carter had 
made after the meet as well, 
emphasizing what a boost the 
All-American and former SEC 
Freshman of the Year will add 
for the Wolverines throughout 
the rest of the season.

“Olivia was awesome today,” 
Bottom said. “We’re lucky to 
have her, and you can see she’s 
embraced the Michigan way.”
Sophomore 
backstroker 
Maggie MacNeil had a strong 
performance, 
winning 
the 
100-yard backstroke by over 
three seconds and the 100-
yard freestyle by over a second. 
MacNeil was a member of the 
medley relay with Carter, along 
with senior Miranda Tucker 
and junior Daria Pyshnenko.
Michigan 
also 
got 
contributions from freshman 
Kaitlynn Sims, who won the 
two distance events, and junior 
Sierra Schmidt, who finished 
second behind her in both 
events, and several seconds 
ahead of the chasing Indiana 
swimmers. 
The Wolverines swept both 
the 100-yard and 200-yard 
butterfly, 
with 
sophomore 
Victoria 
Kwan 
and 
senior 
Vanessa Krause finishing a few 
seconds behind Carter in the 
200-yard race. Carter also was 
joined by Krause and freshman 
Megan Glass in sweeping the 
100-yard butterfly.
“We had some people that 
were down,” Bottom said, “and 
they fought. Whether they 
swim really great, or not so 
much, they still step into the 
team and help it keep moving 
forward.”
The 
diving 
team 
helped 
Michigan 
as 
well, 
with 
freshman 
Lucy 
Hogan, 

sophomore 
Camryn 

McPherson, 
junior 
Nikki 
Canale and freshman Lauren 
Cheetham 
claiming 
first, 
second, 
third 
and 
fourth, 
respectively, 
in 
3-meter 
springboard. 
Hogan 
scored 
311.93 points in the win. Canale 
won the 1-meter as well, scoring 
279.97 points.
“I’m really confident now,” 
MacNeil 
said. 
“I’m 
really 
excited 
to 
have 
(Carter) 
because she’s such a great asset 
to the team, and just the extra 
confidence there will help the 
team.”

Davis making strides as backup ‘5’

There were a lot of things 
I expected when I signed on 
to cover the Michigan men’s 
basketball team this season.
But Austin Davis, I did not 
expect. And how could I? After 
three years of limited minutes 
off the bench and a promising 
backup at the big man spot 
in sophomore forward Colin 
Castleton, how could I — or 
anyone else, for that matter 
— have expected Davis to 
establish himself in his senior 
season?
And yet here we are, two 
months into the year, and 
Davis is — well, he’s doing 
some things. 
Some 
of 
those 
things 
are: eight points against an 
Iowa team that ranks 16th 
in KenPom, eight rebounds 
and 
three 
blocks 
against 
Presbyterian, a solid defensive 
performance 
against 
a 
formidable 
Purdue 
offense 
and a composed appearance 
against 
Michigan 
State 
in 
an 
anything-but-composed 
Breslin Center.
Amid frequent foul trouble 
for 
Teske 
and 
a 
largely 
disappointing 
sophomore 
season for Castleton, Davis’ 
success couldn’t have come at a 
better time for Michigan.
“Austin Davis was huge for 
us tonight,” Michigan coach 
Juwan Howard said after the 
Iowa game. “Austin was the 
next man up. We have this 
model, on our team: ‘Stay 
ready, so you don’t have to get 
ready.’ And that’s how our guy 
responded. I’m so proud of that 
effort.”
Davis isn’t doing anything 
differently, 
he 
says. 
But 
practicing against the likes of 
Moe Wagner and Jordan Poole 
and playing on scout teams 
of some of the country’s best 
college basketball programs 
is 
finally 
paying 
off, 
and 
Davis is proving himself as a 

reliable and more than capable 
extended-minutes backup big 
man. 
Not many of us saw this 
coming. I certainly didn’t. 
But after years of having the 
next-man-up mentality drilled 
into him, Davis was more than 
ready when the 
time 
finally 
did come. His 
poise on and 
off the court 
has 
been 
a 
testament 
to 
that. 
“It 
felt 
good to go in 
and do that,” 
Davis 
said, 
laughing, after 
the Wolverines’ win over the 
Hawkeyes. “It’s just about 
filling whatever role that my 
brothers need that day.”
Now Davis isn’t going to 
start getting equal playing time 
with Teske, or even close to it, 
at least assuming Teske doesn’t 
get himself in foul trouble as 
soon as he steps out onto the 
hardwood. But it wouldn’t 
be surprising if Davis starts 
seeing more minutes on the 

court this season, especially as 
Michigan heads into the heart 
of a challenging conference 
schedule rife with imposing big 
men like Penn State’s Lamar 
Stevens and Mike Watkins, 
and prolific offenses like the 
one head coach Mark Turgeon 
is running down 
at Maryland.
Whatever 
Michigan needs 
him for, though, 
it’s 
becoming 
increasingly 
clear that Davis 
will be a pretty 
reliable source.
“It’s 
being 
ready 
for 
whatever 
the 
team needs that day,” Davis 
said. “Today, it was going 
in and playing some, and 
contributing that way. Other 
days it might be getting the 
starters and the high-minute 
guys a good-looking practice.
“It’s been frustrating at 
times, but just really staying 
positive, 
being 
happy 
for 
my brothers when they do 
something great, that’s really 
helped a lot, too.”

‘M’ preparing for repeat matchups

The Michigan hockey team is 
now in the second half of its season, 
and that second half implies quite a 
bit of preparation. 
It’s now crunch time for the 
Wolverines. Sitting second-to-last 
in the conference and 32nd in the 
PairWise Rankings, they must 
prepare to fight each weekend to 
have any hope at an at-large NCAA 
Tournament bid or to get a better 
seed in the conference tournament.
The latter half also signifies 
that Michigan (9-11-2 overall, 4-7-1 
Big Ten) must now prepare to play 
series against each conference 
opponent for the second time. 
How the Wolverines prepare for 
these meetings will be somewhat 
different than the first time.
“You know a little bit more 
about them,” Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson said. “Some of the newer 
players and maybe nuances. Most 
teams have the same structure 
they’ve had over the years, and 
some teams have gotten better. 
Some teams have grown and the 
freshman, they’re not freshman 
anymore.”
The extent to which preparation 
changes 
varies 
depending 
on 
the 
opponent. 
For 
instance, 

Pearson notes opponents with 
younger rosters often adapt more 
throughout the season and one 
must game plan accordingly. This 
is evident in comparing Penn State 
and Wisconsin.
“(The Nittany Lions have) got 
a couple young players but they 
don’t rely on them as much as all 
their vets,” Pearson said. “So you 
have a pretty good idea how they’re 
going to play what they’re going to 
do. Where a team like Wisconsin 
has got all those high-end young 
players. And the next time we see 
them they’re gonna be a lot more 
mature, play a little bit different and 
probably be a lot more dangerous.”
Playing a rival for a second 
series can impact what goes on in 
the film room. This past weekend, 
the Wolverines swept then-No. 14 
Notre Dame on the road in the first 
meeting between the two sides this 
season. 
Prior to the series, Michigan had 
to balance relevancy with recency. 
On one hand, it’s helpful for a 
team to see how it fared against a 
particular opponent in the past. 
But at the same time, it’s critical 
to understand the intricacies of an 
opponent in the current season. So 
before the series, the Wolverines 
studied clips from last season’s 
contests against the Fighting Irish, 

but also made sure to analyze tape 
from Notre Dame’s most recent 
series against Western Michigan.
From here on out, though, 
striking that balance is easier. Now 
that Michigan has faced all its 
conference opponents, it has tape 
that is both recent and relevant.
“You learn some things when 
you played them once and so this 
time around we can show film 
against when we played them 
this year versus maybe another 
team,” Pearson said. “I think that 
sometimes players watch it a little 
more intent because it’s us against 
them. It’s not Niagara against Penn 
State. We don’t know their players. 
We know our team, so that’s good.”
Pearson 
doesn’t 
have 
a 
preference in terms of playing a 
team for the first or second time, 
while freshman defenseman Cam 
York does. York has experience 
in playing the same opponents 
multiple 
times 
throughout 
a 
season, as the U.S. National Team 
Development Program — which 
he played for prior to joining 
Wolverines — follows such a 
schedule.
“I’d probably say I like it better 
the second time,” York said. “Just 
because you kind of have an idea 
of how they play and areas that you 
can try to expose them.”

Andrew Fenty adjusting to increased expectations in sophomore season

At the end of Andrew Fenty’s 
freshman season, the accolades 
were coming in droves. 
Intercollegiate 
Tennis 
Association Freshman of the 
Year. Big Ten Freshman of the 
Year. First-Team All-Big Ten. 
So 
when 
Fenty 
was 
nominated for Male Freshman 
of the Year in the MGoBlue 
Awards, 
he 
thought 
things 
would go his way. 
“I had just gotten NCAA 
Rookie of the Year,” Fenty said, 
a grin beginning to envelope his 
boyish face. “So I was like, ‘Oh, 
I’m gonna get it for sure.’ ”
Nearly seven months after 
the awards, Fenty now grins 
because he didn’t win. The 
honor was instead bestowed 
on men’s basketball standout 
Ignas Brazdeikis. 
It proved to be a humbling 
moment of introspection and 
appreciation for Fenty. 
“Drew started to realize, 
‘Hey, I’m surrounded by world-
class athletes not only on my 
team, but on all teams here,’ 
” said Michigan coach Adam 
Steinberg. “He just started to 
take pride in that.”
“Michigan — playing for 
Michigan 
— 
it’s 
honestly 
different,” Fenty said. “You only 
get it if you’re an athlete here. 
Being an athlete at Michigan is 
not a normal experience. Iggy, 
you know, he’s in the league 
now, which is crazy. There’s 
just world champions, NBA 
players. It’s normal here.”
Living up to such lofty 
standards, for some, can be 
burdensome. Many collegiate 
athletes struggle to cope with 
the pressure that comes with 
representing a school rich in 
athletic tradition. 
But not Fenty.
“I like it,” Fenty said. “I 
really like it. It motivates me 
a lot, makes me feel like I’ve 
got to work. Playing on those 
courts, seeing all the All-
Americans and the banners on 
the walls, there’s just a lot to 
play for here.”
Fenty is no novice when it 

comes to being surrounded by 
gifted athletes, and has long-
drawn motivation from a will 
to keep up with his peers. 
The athletic feats of his 
family members, 
in 
Fenty’s 
opinion, 
dwarf 
his own, which 
he places into 
his 
family’s 
“lowest 
tier.” 
That’s 
because 
his grandfather, 
Phil, 
runs 
grueling 
100-
mile 
contests 
dubbed 
ultramarathons; 
his father, Adrian, competes 
in marathons and triathlons; 
and so on from aunt to uncle to 
mother to cousin. Seeing such 
achievements pushes Fenty to 
work harder on his own craft. 
And 
Fenty 
grew 
up 
surrounded by tennis greatness 

at the prized Junior Tennis 
Champions Center in College 
Park, Maryland. The JTCC, 
noted 
for 
talented 
alumni 
like Frances Tiafoe and Denis 
Kudla, 
enabled 
Fenty to see the 
potential fruits 
of his labor. 
“He’s 
seen 
the 
guys 
he 
grew 
up 
with 
have successful 
professional 
careers, 
and 
he wants that,” 
Steinberg 
said. 
“He 
wants 
people to know 
that, hey, Andrew Fenty is 
gonna be one of those guys. And 
so long as he stays humble and 
keeps maturing, he will make a 
name for himself in this game 
one day. He has the ability, 
that’s for sure.”
The talent has been evident 

since 
Fenty 
enrolled 
at 
Michigan as a highly-touted 
blue-chip 
recruit. 
Now 
a 
sophomore, with an impressive 
year of collegiate tennis under 
his belt, Fenty’s 
bar 
is 
raised. 
As 
the 
center 
of 
attention, 
he’ll 
have 
to 
deal with added 
popularity 
and 
expectations 
— 
a stage that all 
budding athletes 
endure at one 
point 
in 
their 
careers. 
At 
the 
Ann 
Arbor Challenger last Tuesday, 
that much was apparent. 
A recipient of a Wild Card 
invitation into the main singles 
draw, Fenty bested teammate 
Ondrej Styler, 7-6, 7-6, and 
moved on to play eighth-seeded 
JC Aragone. 

The 
Challenger 
is 
an 
individual 
tournament, 
differentiating 
it 
from 
the 
team competitions that make 
up the bulk of Michigan’s 
schedule. After 
he 
eliminated 
Styler, 
Fenty 
was 
the 
lone 
Wolverine 
remaining in the 
event — all eyes 
were 
on 
him, 
quite 
literally. 
The 
seating 
overlooking 
the court of the 
Fenty-Aragone 
match 
was 
packed to the brim. 
Amongst 
the 
crowd, 
in 
addition 
to 
all 
of 
Fenty’s 
teammates and coaches, was 
Evan King, a three-time ITA 
All-American at Michigan, who 
was a Wolverine from 2010-
2013. Not too long ago, King 

was showing Fenty around Ann 
Arbor as a volunteer assistant 
on Fenty’s recruiting visit. Now, 
King, who also participated 
in 
the 
Challenger, 
stands 
behind the seats, watching the 
program’s future play on the 
courts he once dominated. 
Fenty lost the match, 6-1, 
6-4, a case of a younger player 
simply running into a more 
seasoned opponent. For Fenty, 
there were more important 
takeaways 
from 
the 
match 
than his play. After the match, 
he noted how he’ll have to 
adjust to and learn to ignore 
outside noise from big crowds 
and attention from successful 
alumni, like King. 
“Once he gets tennis specific 
in his mind, the rankings and 
expectations and this and that, 
that will go away,” Steinberg 
said. “It’s not easy to do when 
you’re young and you had the 
year he had last year.”
Thus far, Steinberg maintains 
that Fenty is dealing with the 
changes admirably. 
“I’ve been coaching for thirty 
years and to see the change in 
Drew from his first fall until 
now, it’s pretty remarkable,” 
Steinberg said. “He’s really 
grown 
a 
lot, 
improved 
in 
every area, not just on the 
court but everywhere — in 
the classroom, as a teammate, 
in understanding what our 
program is about. I use him as 
an example all the time.”
Inside the Varsity Tennis 
Center, a half hour removed 
from 
his 
Challenger 
loss 
and having just finished up 
routine post-match work on 
the stationary bike, Fenty leans 
his slender 6-foot-4 frame up 
against an off-white railing. 
The crowd that flooded his 
match is long gone, the building 
largely quiet except for the 
mellow sounds accompanying a 
few ongoing tennis rallies. His 
eyes gaze beyond the courts, 
settling on the walls draped by 
the banners and placards that 
memorialize Michigan tennis 
lore. 
“I’m just trying to make my 
own name,” Fenty said. “Trying 
to do something in tennis. 
That’s what I’m here for.”

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | JANUARY 15, 2020

I thought I’d aged out of this years ago. I’m sitting criss-cross-applesauce in my apartment while my roommate 
straightens my hair. The brush catches my hair knots and pulls my head back like the boys in my elementary 
school used to do, though it wasn’t because they liked me. 
The hair situation isn’t going as planned. My curls are beginning to spring back from stress sweat, either caused 
by the fact that I’m going to a dance with a stranger or the fear that I won’t fit in with the crowd. I have less than 
20 minutes to figure out how I can turn my curly hair, acne and glasses into something remotely resembling a 

D

ue to security reasons, the doors 
to this train will not open.”
The loudspeaker on Delhi’s 
metro blared the warning message during 
the ride I was taking to meet a friend one 
night in the south of the city after protests 
had settled for the day. I was afraid to step 
off the train in the district after dark, not 
knowing what I might see from that day’s 
unrest. To my dismay, the metro did not 
stop where I intended to depart.
As a researcher of international politics, 
I spend most of my time in the summer 
abroad: consulting archives, conduct-
ing interviews and collecting data. My 
research agenda, centered on conflict and 
peace, is driven broadly by activist goals 
of societal change toward the eradica-
tion of violence. My investment in social 
movements has thus multiplied over the 
years as my exposure has increased. My 
experience witnessing a social movement 
closely and intensely is limited, but on my 
most recent trip to India, massive mobili-
zations broke out opposing the passage of 
the Citizen Amendment Act, catalyzing 
what has become a spreading cycle of pro-
tests across the country.
I have only ever read about the way 
protests unfold, I haven’t witnessed their 
outbreak or navigated their consequences. 
While there, friends, researchers and I 
gauged how police might respond to vari-
ous districts and to different demograph-
ics on each day of the movement. Risks 
of violence were pervasive and caused us 
anxiety stomach-deep. We stayed in con-
tact with one another to check in on the 
safety of friends scattered across the area 
and sprung to action when it was compro-
mised. Police barricades blocked roads 
and armed members stood conspicuously, 
yelling when passersby strayed from the 
path. During the peak of masses taking to 
the streets, we lost contact as mobile cell 
service was cut off and restrictions were 
placed on travel. 
After two weeks, I returned to the 
United States. The brevity of my visit was 
a mere glimpse of a movement’s frontline. 
I cannot suggest that I know everything 
about the prolonged fear or empowerment 
that comes from an individual’s long-term 
participation in activism, only that a short 
period of time in the midst of its threats 

and dangers revealed to 
me how much bravery 
it requires to stay in the 
thick of it. 
In 
this 
increasingly 
small, globalized world 
we are implicated in car-
ing for those issues which 
are not on our frontlines 
through 
connections 
forged by corporations, 
bodies 
of 
governance, 
internet communication 
and migration. How can 
we possibly hope to con-
tribute, when gulfs still 
exist between us?
Having returned, I am 
becoming aware of how 
different my role is for 
causes unfolding beyond 
my borders. Being away 
has granted me freedom 
in conducting work for a 
cause that is not possible 
from the proximate posi-
tion — without worries of 
physical survival or safety from the state, I 
can speak my opinions more freely, access 
unrestricted sources of information and 
generate dialogues to grow a network of 
the sympathetic. Contributing to collec-
tive memory, applying external pressure, 
information spreading and fundraising 
are all roles for those who are non-proxi-
mate to this issue. Research, record keep-
ing and contact cannot be conducted amid 
internet shutdowns, but can from afar.
Still, those technologies that apparently 
bridge the distances between us through 
communication and travel can also be 
used to entrench distance, as they often do 
when used in contemporary conflict. 
I have a recurring nightmare where 
two young boys are gifted a video game 
by an elder member of their family who 
is an army general. The game is like any 
other in their repertoire, where bloodied 
cities are the end goal for players who tote 
guns, grenades and girls to accomplish the 
mission. The boys play this gifted game 
day in and out, sending pixelated bombs 
to places they cannot pronounce. In the 
dream, however, the simulation is not a 
game — it’s reality. The bombs they drop 

are not points scored but predetermined 
military plans. 
The dream mirrors contemporary con-
flict and modern technology, wherein 
trained officials use screens in distant 
countries to send conflict wherever they 
are instructed. I fear the reality of recruit-
ment for children into these conflicts looks 
a lot like virtual gaming with promises of 
valor and victory, too. My nightmare and 
its subsequent reality remind me how the 
distance between warring parties — cre-
ated by technology — in interstate wars 
have allowed Western nations to out-
source death and violence anywhere they 
choose, without ever confronting its dam-
ages. We’ve built technology to plug into, 
and become invested in, any global issue 
but we retreat from it when the reality it 
creates is too painful to face.
I’d like to imagine that it is harder to 
commit the violence of war with proxim-
ity between those in conflict. The famous 
Christmas Truce of 1914 tells the tale of 
a field between World War I’s trenches 
where soldiers from across enemy lines 
agreed to a temporary ceasefire. In the 
field, they shared holiday songs, played 

a game of ball and exchanged chocolates 
and photos of family members back at 
home. Afterward, they found it impossible 
to return to war — eventually, the battal-
ions were moved to another frontline in 
hopes that they could be convinced again 
to fight. They could not. 
The moment has been memorialized 
in opera and commercials and its depic-
tion illuminates how hard it becomes to 
commit violence against those we under-
stand through a shared tradition. The 
more we enact violence through computer 
screens the more it will seem to us a simu-
lation and not a lived experience. But for 
those proximate to the real-life carnage, 
there is no shutdown button.
A handful of issues look different up 
close than they do from far away, and the 
way we approach our contributions might, 
too. Climate change will take away coast-
lines some of us have never seen before it 
reaches middle America, and economic 
inequality can hide from those in too tall 
of towers to see it. Still, to tackle these 
causes equitably, we’ll need to plug in and 
act out — no matter the place we sit. The 
doors to the train must open.

The power of proximity

etween the first floor and the eighth, my 
mother lived out her dreams with another 
man. Those twenty seconds of elevator time 
stretched into an entire lifespan as I watched her 
look into the eyes of her silver-haired, white-linen-
wearing would-be lover and imagine what would be 
different if he was hers, or if the two of them strode 
off the elevator and down the endless shoreline just 
outside the hotel. 
It was odd to see her disarmed in such a way, odd to 
see her unfurl under the warm gaze and witty remarks 
of a good-looking stranger. When the doors opened 
to our floor, she and I got off silently and back into 
our life outside the elevator shaft. We walked into our 
hotel room and sat on the balcony overlooking that 
same endless shoreline. With her chin resting on her 
hand and a playful look in her eyes, she turned to me 
and said “He was a nice man.” I nodded. “He was.”
We said nothing more about it and didn’t see him 
on the few other elevator rides we took. But at that 
moment when my mom turned her head to me after 
our encounter with him, I saw an entirely different 
world flash in her eyes. In it were a past and a future 
where she and the elevator man lived happily: her 
perpetually making good jokes, him perpetually 
laughing at them in his white linen, the two of them 
perpetually loving one another as happy, funny, well-
dressed people should be loved. 
There were no woes or flaws, and any difficulties 
were solved by the both of them, bound together in 
passionate, affectionate devotion. Elevator Man could 
fix my mom’s car, darn a sock and cook a tasty meal. 
He could hike just as long and just as far as she could, 
and he loved going to see live music. He dressed well 
— even when he didn’t wear white linen — and he kept 
himself well-groomed. 
Elevator Man kissed my mother on the cheek when 
she got home from work and never had crumbs stuck 
in the corners of his mouth. He did her laundry and 
told her how beautiful she looked in that one dress 
as he folded it — and he really meant it. Elevator Man 
told my mom how he liked her crow’s feet, liked how 
her eyes switched from green to blue to hazel, liked 
her high Irish cheekbones and her loud Irish laugh.
Elevator Man could still get it on, even though he 
was nearing sixty. He could hold my mom close and 
they would reminisce about when they were twenty-
one, thirty-seven, forty-two. They’d giggle about him 
visiting her as she worked at the burger joint in their 
college town. They’d thank God they made it through 
her mother’s death fifteen years before. They’d poke 
fun at how his dad always politely refused my mother’s 
cooking. And they’d look forward to growing older 
still: to retiring, to walking slowly down the sidewalk 
together and to the small cabin they hoped to buy 
with their savings.
That life existed only inside the elevator — inside 
my mother’s eyes for a moment after she’d chatted 
with a friendly stranger. The longer she and I sat there 
on the balcony, the more we sunk back into ourselves, 
and bit by bit, Elevator Man just became another 
passerby going about his own little life somewhere. 
My mother took her hand out from under her chin, 
squeezed my arm and smiled. I watched the side of 
her face as she stared off the balcony, her cheekbones 
proud and her crow’s feet delicate.
It is strange how quickly we can imagine other 
lifetimes, strange how quickly we can serve up 

alternatives to whatever day-to-day realities we 
live. It’s possible my mother never envisioned this 
elevator world — possible it’s just a figment of my 
own imagination. But even if she didn’t, or even if 
the world she created for herself and her lover looked 
different than the one I created, it wouldn’t matter. 
We create entire worlds for strangers in the blink of 
an eye, briefly fall in love with the man in the elevator 
with us, construct different versions of ourselves in a 
split second.
It seems natural enough, writing a little fiction 
here and there to take the edge off some of the 
harsher realities of our lives. For my mother, it is the 
harshness of being an aging woman in this world — 
the world without Elevator Man. It is the sunspots 
on the backs of hands, the thinning strands of hair, 
the almighty maxims that beauty is for youth, that 
love is for youth, that sexuality is for youth. For those 
twenty seconds in the elevator there exists a place for 
my mother to be all those things at fifty-seven. For 
those twenty seconds in the elevator, there exists a 
man who loves the lines of her smile and the curves of 
her softened arms as much as I do.
Quickly, the seconds stretch into a long, magical 
lifetime: one where a 
woman can be loved in 
her age the same way 
she was loved in her 
youth — one where a 
woman can love herself 
in her age the same 
way she did in youth. 
There, the witches, old 
maids 
and 
spinsters 
become 
goddesses; 
Lady 
Godiva 
rides 
through England with 
her white hair cropped 
close to her head and 
her open breasts worn 
by 
the 
wariness 
of 
womanhood; old wives’ 
tales hold the same 
weight as Bible verses. 
This is the world of 
Elevator Man — in full 
color and just at the 
end 
of 
my 
mother’s 
fingertips.
One 
day 
my 
own 
Elevator 
Man 
may 
come and sweep me off 
my feet too. Maybe he 
will replace someone 
I’ve lost, or make up 
for someone I’ve yet to 
find — it’s hard to say. 
Perhaps he will run 
his fingers through my 
graying hair or chop 
the onions for me when 
my knuckles curl up too 
tight. Maybe he will just 
be a handsome stranger 
to imagine a name for 
as I wait for the ding to 
sound and the doors to 
open.

Whatever it is, it will last no more than a few 
minutes and never leave the confines of the elevator 
shaft. Then I will walk out and back into reality. Real 
sunlight will flood back in, real sounds will replace 
the elevator music and real people — for whom there 
is not enough time to imagine a name, a life or a love 
— will walk past me. I will re-enter life as I know it, 
and Elevator Man will re-enter his, too. But there 
will always exist that impossible world which I or 
whoever else briefly imagined inside the elevator; 
there will always exist that small space where fantasy 
supersedes the reality we face when the doors slide 
open.
Just as it is a comfort to imagine these worlds for 
a moment, it is a comfort, too, to save them only for 
rides from the first floor to the eighth. Outside of 
those bounds — on flights of stairs, on balconies — 
there may be a daughter who loves the way your big 
teeth shine as your head tilts back in laughter. There 
may be a man — a real one — who, despite a crumb or 
two stuck in the corner of his mouth, will help you 
carry your boundless, aging beauty through the rest 
of your days as the two of you remember the palpable, 
messy, full life you’ve shared.

I thought I’d aged out of this years ago. I’m sitting criss-cross-applesauce in my apartment while my roommate 
straightens my hair. The brush catches my hair knots and pulls my head back like the boys in my elementary 
school used to do, though it wasn’t because they liked me. 
The hair situation isn’t going as planned. My curls are beginning to spring back from stress sweat, either caused 
by the fact that I’m going to a dance with a stranger or the fear that I won’t fit in with the crowd. I have less than 
20 minutes to figure out how I can turn my curly hair, acne and glasses into something remotely resembling a

0,704 votes. 28 years. In 2016, 
presidential 
candidate 
Donald 
Trump became the first Republican 
in 28 years to win Michigan — changing 
electoral history with 10,704 votes, a 
0.3 percent margin of victory. From a 
battleground state to a near “gimme” for 
Democrats, Michigan has come to the 
front and center of the 2020 presidential 
election, with the University of Michigan 
in tow. But before the fanfare of a debate 
at the University in October and Election 
Day in November, each party needs a 
nominee. 
The Republican nominee is a foregone 
conclusion: It will be President Donald 
Trump, presuming he is not convicted in 
the Senate after being impeached by the 
U.S. House of Representatives. Trump 

will be the first president to stand in a 
general election after being impeached, 
as President Andrew Johnson failed 
to win his party’s nomination after 
his impeachment and President Bill 
Clinton 
was 
term-limited. 
Johnson’s 
Republicans and Clinton’s Democrats 
subsequently lost the presidency. As 
of early December, Trump enjoys an 
89 
percent 
approval 
rating 
among 
Republicans, and his reelection bid 
is widely supported, with some state 
Republican 
parties 
canceling 
their 
primary. The University’s chapter of 
College Republicans declined to comment 
about their organization’s plans for the 
primary election.
The real political battle in Michigan 
will play out on the Democratic side. On 

March 10, Michigan voters will head to 
the polls and ask their polling station staff 
for either a Republican or Democratic 
ballot. Michigan is an open primary state, 
so voters do not need to be a registered 
Democrat or Republican to vote in the 
primary. With 147 delegates up for grabs 
and general election hopes hinging on it, 
Michigan is a key target for candidates. 
March 10 marks a week after “Super 
Tuesday,” where 15 states and territories 
hold their primary or caucus. Michigan 
votes in a “mini-Super Tuesday” along 
with Idaho, Mississippi, North Dakota, 
Missouri and Washington. 
Democratic candidates have to acquire 
1,991 delegates, a simple majority, to 
secure the party’s nomination. But states 
are not winner-take-all. The Democratic 

National Committee awards delegates 
proportionally based on votes, so second, 
third and even fourth place candidates 
can pick up delegates. This means silver 
and bronze medals matter, but candidates 
need to pick up at least 15 percent of 
the vote to win delegates, which ideally 
entails going all over the state to try 
to pick up votes. In the 2016 Michigan 
primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., won 
with 49.8 percent of the vote and received 
67 delegates, compared to candidate 
and former Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton’s 63 delegates for winning 48.3 
percent of the vote. 
Candidates aren’t solely focusing on 
Detroit and its suburbs, the most populous 
blue area of Michigan, so Democratic 
candidates are expected to make their 
way to Ann Arbor, another Democratic 
stronghold. In 2016, Ann Arbor saw the 
likes of Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., then-
candidate 
Hillary 
Clinton’s 
running 
mate, on the Diag. Sanders held a rally 
at the UMMA. Even President Barack 
Obama came to speak at the Ray Fisher 
Stadium the day before the election, 
urging students and locals to vote for 
Clinton. 
The University of Michigan I knew in 
my first year, 2016, had famous politicians 
stopping in weekly and canvassers on 
every corner asking if you’re registered to 
vote. Then, two months into my freshman 
year, Donald Trump was elected president 
of the United States. Emotions ran high 
on campus — a vigil was held on the Diag 
the following day and even University 
President Mark Schlissel sent an email 
regarding the results. 
About 
45 
percent 
of 
University 
students voted in 2016, while 50.4 percent 
voted at all other reported institutions. 
In 2018, the University touted the 
midterm election voter turnout with the 
headline “U-M student voter turnout 
triples in 2018.” In reality, turnout tripled 
compared to the 2014 midterms, when 
an embarrassing 14 percent of students 
voted. The 2018 turnout — 41 percent — 
was still less than the 2016 turnout, but 
did outpace the national average. Shortly 
after Trump’s election, the Big Ten 
Conference created the “Big Ten Voting 
Challenge” between the 14 member 
schools to register more students to 
vote and encourage students to exercise 
their voting rights. Two winners will 
be crowned after the 2020 presidential 
election, both the school with the highest 
turnout and the school with the largest 
voter growth. 
The timing of the challenge begs the 
question: Why did this challenge come 
after 2016? The abysmal voter turnout for 
the 2014 midterms elections across the 
Big Ten didn’t spark a voting initiative. 
Voter turnout has always been an issue 
in the U.S., but only after the election of 
such an anti-establishment figure did our 

institutions of higher learning try to do 
something about it.
With weeks still to go before the 
Michigan primary, the latest poll from 
January has former Vice President Joe 
Biden winning the state with 29.9 percent 
of the vote and Sanders finishing in 
second with 19.9 percent. Both would 
pick up delegates in this scenario, and 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Ma., polling at 
16.2 percent, would meet the 15 percent 
threshold 
and 
therefore 
qualify 
for 
delegates. In 2016, Sanders pulled off a 
narrow victory over Clinton, winning 49.8 
percent of the vote, including winning 
Washtenaw County by about 8,000 votes. 
If Biden does win Michigan come March, 
one can expect Washtenaw County’s 
winner to differ from the statewide 
winner.
T

he 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 
chapter of College Democrats is 
currently laying the groundwork 
for the eventual nominee and will not 
endorse a candidate in the primary.
“College Democrats does not endorse 
any candidate during a Democratic 
primary race. However, we are still heavily 
involved in this upcoming election cycle,” 
Camille Mancuso, communications chair 
of College Democrats, wrote in an email 
interview. “So far this year, we have 
engaged in issue advocacy, co-hosted 
debate watch parties with some of the 
Presidential campaigns on campus and 
registered hundreds of student voters.”
While the chapter is focused on the 
general election, some of its members are 
involved in specific campaigns, like many 
other students on campus.
L

SA junior Arden Shapiro serves 
as a campus corps leader for 
Students 
for 
Bernie. 
With 
a leadership group of 10 people, the 
organization 
works 
with 
Sanders’ 
national campaign to coordinate efforts 
on campus. Shapiro and other group 
leaders participated in “Students for 
Bernie Summer School,” an online-based 
program that teaches organizing and 
campaigning for Sanders. Utilizing an 
email list of more than 200, the group 
canvasses and engages in “friend to friend 
organizing.” Shapiro found herself drawn 
to Sanders’ “unwavering” advocacy for 
social justice and his plans to address 
climate change.
“I have always been drawn to Senator 
Sanders because I feel he is a fearless 
and unwavering advocate for justice and 
equality,” Shapiro said. “...The issue of 
climate is particularly important to me, 
and I feel that Senator Sanders is the only 
candidate who understands the urgency 
of revolutionizing our economy to combat 
climate change and protecting those most 
vulnerable to environmental injustice.”
Sanders 
recently 
topped 
an 
Iowa 
poll 
that 
notably 
has 
South 
Bend 
Mayor Pete Buttigieg slipping to third. 

Warren, who finished second in the 
poll and is ideologically closest to 
Sanders, accused Sanders of “sending his 
volunteers out to trash me,” in reference 
to a released Politico report. Sanders’ 
campaign 
has 
not 
commented, 
but 
Sanders himself praised Warren and said 
the document did not reflect his opinion.
LSA junior Jordyn Houle is one of four 
campus organizers for Warren at the 
University. In an email interview, Houle 
explained that her support of Warren is 
rooted in Warren’s focus on the need for 
fundamental change. 
“I support Elizabeth Warren because 
she has a bold, progressive vision for 
our country as well as the detailed 
plans necessary to make that vision a 
reality…” Houle wrote. “Senator Warren 
understands that systemic changes, such 
as a Green New Deal and universal free 
public college, are necessary in order to 
create an America where everybody can 
live a fulfilling life.” 
Students for Warren at the University 
is directly affiliated with the national 
campaign. With about 40 students at 
weekly meetings, the group canvasses 
for Warren, registers voters and helps 
students with absentee ballots. The 
group also runs a listserv with nearly 300 
members.
Warren 
entered 
the 
presidential 
race the earliest of the frontrunners, 
announcing an exploratory committee on 
New Year’s Eve 2018. In early February 
2019, she formalized her run, and that 
November, Warren topped a New York 
Times/Siena College poll of Iowa. Since 
then, however, her support has waned in 
the first caucus state.
LSA 
freshman 
Andrew 
Schaeffler 
helped co-found Students for Biden at the 
University. The group recently took over 
Biden’s campaign Instagram account, 
receiving hundreds of thousands of views 
on their efforts to elect Biden. Schaeffler 
is drawn to Biden’s education plan as well 
as his political track record and pragmatic 
approach. 
“What really draws me to Vice President 
Biden is a history of action and reasonable 
progressive policies that can be enacted,” 
Schaeffler said. “I believe that his 
policies, while they might not be the most 
far-reaching, the most expansive, they’re 
the ones that can actually happen. When 
you look at what candidate can not only 
produce results but has produced results, 
by far and away I believe that Joe Biden is 
definitely that candidate.”
Electability is also on Schaeffler’s mind, 
with Biden beating Trump by at least 5 
percentage points nationally in CNN, 
Fox News and Quinnipiac polls from 
December. 
However, 
Biden 
suffers 
from a “young person problem,” with 
an October poll in Iowa finding that 2 
percent of 18-29-year-olds support the 
former vice president. 

“As much as some people, in general, 
stray away from the electability argument 
when you look at polls in swing states … 
Joe Biden is the candidate that can reach 
across the aisle to voters who are both 
Republican and Independent, and I value 
that a lot in really anyone…” Schaeffler 
said.
While 
Biden 
has 
a 
track 
record 
of 
bipartisanship, 
Congressional 
Republicans have shown no indication of 
working with a Democratic president.
Students for Biden plans to do “dorm 
storms” in residence halls, where students 
knock on doors to canvass for Biden. With 
about two dozen students involved in 
Students for Biden, the group also plans to 
table in Mason Hall and drum up support. 
LSA senior Jessica Kosticak founded 
the student group supporting Buttigieg 
for president. Armed with a Twitter 
account “Umich for Pete Buttigieg” with 
a few hundred followers and a listserv 
with about 30 students, Kosticak is just 
getting started in politics, having studied 
biomolecular science during her four 
years at the University. 
“There’s been a huge learning curve for 
me getting involved with founding this 
organization and being more politically 
active, which is great, I hadn’t expected 
that coming into college,” Kosticak said. 
“… It definitely has been interesting 
for me to kind of learn a lot more about 
the political process and supporting a 
candidate, how that looks online and then 
how that looks in person.”
Buttigieg began gaining traction in 
the spring following a CNN town hall in 
March at South by Southwest. With his 
rise over the following months, Kosticak 
found herself drawn to his calm demeanor 
and his actionable policy proposals, such 
as “Medicare for all who want it.”
“I was blown away with how articulate 
he was — he reminded me kind of 
(President) Obama in that way,” Kosticak 
said. “He was able to express himself and 
his ideas in a way that was just calm and 
collected and I was drawn to that because 
I think with the turmoil going on in 
politics currently, that voice of reason is 
what we need.”
Since his rise, Buttigieg has positioned 
himself more moderately than some 
expected, failing to pass some progressive 
purity tests such as supporting Medicare-
for-all, swearing off big-money campaign 
fundraisers and committing to the Green 
New Deal (Buttigieg has proposed a less 
aggressive version of the Green New Deal). 
These divisions were front and center at 
the December Democratic debate, where 
Warren and Sanders drew a stark contrast 
between their progressive policies and 
Buttigieg’s moderate stance, but Kosticak 
plans to support the nominee no matter 
what. 
“My hope is that after the Michigan 
primary and all the primaries, we settle 

on a nominee that all of the student 
groups and everyone, Democrats across 
the country, will be able to unite behind 
the nominee because we have bigger fish 
to fry…” Kosticak said.
Engineering senior Justin Zhao is 
actively involved in tech entrepreneur 
Andrew Yang’s campaign for president. 
Zhao is a member of “Yang Gang Ann 
Arbor,” serving as the group’s event 
coordinator. 
Referring 
to 
Yang 
as 
“Andrew,” Zhao is drawn to Yang’s 
expertise in dealing with technology. 
Zhao referenced the race in artificial 
intelligence with China, data privacy 
issues and the government’s old fashioned 
approach to technology and its future.
“Right now our government is super 
behind on technology, I mean you saw 
the Facebook hearing with (CEO) Mark 
Zuckerberg,” Zhao said. “He is the best 
equipped to deal with technology and 
technology regulations.”
Zhao 
also 
likes 
Yang’s 
seemingly 
bipartisan, evidence-based approach to 
politics. One of Yang’s slogans is “Not 
left. Not right. Forward.” Zhao pointed to 
Yang’s use of data and math in his policy 
platform as a draw.
“He is very unifying because he is not 
ideological and you know he’s all about the 
math and then he’s all about solutions,” 
Zhao said. “It’s an ideas-based campaign 
so he’s all about solutions, data, math and 
those things are bipartisan. It’s not like 
a Democrat (sic) thing or a Republican 
thing.”
With about 30 active members, the 
group’s campaign efforts have thus far 
included tabling and chalking sidewalks, 
and the group’s continued campaigning is 
dependent on Yang’s results and prospects 
in the early primaries.
I

t 
bears 
repeating: 
Anyone 
registered to vote in the state of 
Michigan can vote in the primary. 
Show up to your polling place, ask for 
a Republican or Democratic ballot and 
cast your vote for the nominee you want. 
If the departure of Sen. Cory Booker, 
D-N.J., is any indication, this race is going 
to change leading up to March 10. In the 
meantime, there are debates (including 
one this past Tuesday), Iowa caucuses, 
the New Hampshire primary, Super 
Tuesday and more. There’s a good chance 
that some of the candidates will have 
dropped out by then, taking their student 
groups with them. But for now, it’s all up 
for grabs here in Ann Arbor and at the 
University. Winners and losers abound, 
these presidential primaries will take no 
prisoners. 
Editor’s note: Sanders, Warren, Biden, 
Buttigieg and Yang were featured due to 
the presence of a student group on campus. 
Other 
2020 
presidential 
candidates 
did not have significant University of 
Michigan student efforts behind their 
campaigns.

Selling New Year’s Eve

2:00 p.m.
Math question: If there are 1.5 million people waiting 
to watch the ball drop in person, what percentage of those 
actually know where to enter Times Square? 
When I decided to go to New York City for New Year’s 
Eve, I imagined there would be at least one sign directing 
people which way to go. My research beforehand led me 
to resources about packing snacks, when to get there and 
how many bathrooms were available (answer: 0). Though 
plenty of people on the Internet advised me to wear a 
diaper, none revealed where to actually enter the event.
I was with my partner, Ty, who overheard some police 
officers directing people to 49th Street. We joined people 
in line and asked if we were in the right place. They all 
said they hoped so. I had a feeling we were in the wrong 
spot — Americans are prone to getting into lines that they 
don’t know where they lead to, and I feared we’d fallen 
into the same trap.
Vendors set up carts full of overpriced “2020” glasses 
and hats to sell while we were stuck in line. With nowhere 
to go, we were the perfect consumer targets. “You need 
this!” they would say and blow a noisemaker in someone’s 
face. 
Suddenly, the NYPD closed the entrance and everyone 
began jumping over the barricade. Ty and I followed them, 
sprinting alongside the thousand-or-so people also trying 
to get a better view of the ball than the person next to them. 
This was America, after all — the land of stepping on 
others to get ahead.

3:00 p.m.
Despite the chaos and disorganization, this was 
the 114th New Year’s celebration in Times Square. It 
began as an inauguration for The New York Times 
headquarters in 1904, effectively replacing the previous 
tradition of ringing in the new year with church bells at 

Trinity Church. 
It’s ironic that a celebration that once began at a church 
could turn into something with such disregard for other 
humans.
As we edged closer to the front of the crowd, I felt more 
like an animal. We were packed like fish in the net at the 
end of “Finding Nemo” — but instead of working together 
to get out, everyone pushed forward in hopes of getting 
an inch closer.
The man next to me was pinned up against the brick 
wall and begged for space to breathe. A shorter person 
next to Ty was nearly levitating off the ground. People 
began screaming from the front of the line but we couldn’t 
see what was happening, nor run if there was any danger. 
We could only wait.

6:00 p.m.
We finally passed the checkpoint and reached the 
barricade at 50th Street, which is at the far back of Times 
Square next to Applebee’s. People would knock on the 
glass and wave at the crowd from inside the restaurant, 
holding up their drinks either in solidarity or to make us 
envious. Perhaps both.
As Ty and I ate our snacks, we listened as people next 
to us blasted music on a speaker and people in front of us 
complained loudly. I resented the fact that we didn’t get 
up earlier to get a closer spot — the people on the block 
in front of us were sitting down, dancing and laughing. I 
imagined partying with them under the light of the Times 
Square screens or in the warmth of Applebee’s, or even 
with my friends in Detroit. 
It began to rain and I sat on the ground facing hundreds 
of legs behind us. In a sort of torturous meditation, I 
stared at them and wondered why I had wanted to come. 

8:00 p.m.

Someone came over and passed out giant hats 
sponsored by Planet Fitness. The hats were “free,” 
but only in the way a phone app is free — there’s 
always a cost, collateral waiting in the shadows. You 
don’t pay with your credit card, but rather with your 
attention.
I suppose that’s why I was at the ball drop in 
the first place; if enough people pay attention to 
something, we’re convinced it has value. That is 
marketing. I’ve watched the event on TV for years 
and always loved seeing the confetti, hearing the 
music, imagining the New Year’s kiss. I wanted it not 
because of an inherent desire, but because the entire 
world thought it was valuable. I figured waiting 10 
hours for it would be worth it. 
That’s just the myth of meritocracy. Working for 
something doesn’t mean it’ll pay off, especially if a 
million others want the same thing. This also goes 
for fame; society still thinks the models lining Times 
Square or the New Year’s Rockin’ Eve performers are 
the ones who deserve the attention. Maybe they’re 
just the ones willing to shove harder on their way to 
the front of the line.
Consumerism naturally leads to competition, 
which extends past buying things. We get into lines 
even if we don’t know where they lead, fight for a 
better spot even if it means suffocating and compare 
our view to those in front of us, even if they’re the 
ones wearing adult diapers. We’re supposed to 
constantly be optimizing, competing and ultimately 
winning. 
In a time of resolutions, the new year is a perfect 
time to be reminded of that.

11:00 p.m.
The Times Square screens seemed to flash brighter the 
longer I stared, wearing out my eyes. I almost preferred 
the vendors blowing noisemakers earlier — at least they 
weren’t faceless brands. I positioned myself behind one 
woman’s Planet Fitness hat to block the lights. 
I wondered how much money Planet Fitness makes 
from New Year’s resolutions alone. Maybe the people 
around me will purchase a gym membership and train for 
next year’s ball drop, trying to outrun the people on the 
treadmill next to them.
As I listened to the faint echoes of performances by 
Post Malone and BTS, whose concert tickets would have 
otherwise cost hundreds of dollars, I realized why I didn’t 
have to pay for this event. Advertisers got what they 
wanted the moment I bought my plane ticket. They made 
me think I wanted to spend New Year’s Eve in Times 
Square, a consumer’s fever dream, surrounded by ads, 
because it was better than what everyone else was doing. 
And I believed them.

Midnight
I figured after waiting for 10 hours, there would be some 
climactic payoff to the night. But instead of a fireworks 
show, underwhelming sparks shot from the tower as the 
ball slowly dropped down the flagpole. We were too far 
back to even see the confetti or hear Auld Lang Syne. The 
whole event felt like an “As Seen on TV” ad.
Still, I got my New Year’s kiss. I crossed it off my bucket 
list so I never have to do it again. And on the subway ride 
back, I made my New Year’s resolution: Don’t look at 
people in front of you, in a crowd or on TV, and wish you 
were them. 
Chances are, it’s better on your side of the screen 
anyways.

I

n 2010, while sitting at a table in a 
no-longer-existing diner, I used the 
iPhone application Lose it! for the 
first time. I was eleven years old.
At the beginning of the last decade, 
“wellness” took off as a modern trend and 
began its descent into a capitalist, money-
making business that thrives on pyramid 
schemes and overpriced vitamins. Ben 
Zimmer, former columnist for The New 
York Times, dated modern wellness back to 
1950 in a 2010 article, beginning with the 
World Health Organization’s 1948 consti-
tution. It read, “Health is a state of com-
plete physical, mental and social well-being 
and not merely the absence of disease or 
infirmity.” Seventy years later, we’ve spi-
raled from a foundation for healthy prac-
tices to an exploitative world of obsessive, 
expensive tendencies. The wellness trend 
has blown up into an industry that boasts 
shiny gyms with expensive membership 
rates, diet powders to add to low-calorie 
smoothies and Instagram accounts of 
white women doing squats and advertising 
flat-tummy teas and homeopathic turmeric 
pills. 
Growing up, I never thought about my 
diet. My siblings and I were lucky to be 
raised on healthy ingredients, fresh pro-
duce and lean proteins. Counting calories 
and being hyper-aware of the things I ate 
was never on my radar. In sixth grade, after 
receiving an iPhone for my birthday, I was 
introduced to the trend of wellness via 
social media. 
I was new to Instagram and was infatu-
ated by the cohort of slim, tanned women 
in well-fitting athleisure who preached 
wellness under the guise of kale juices and 

grass-colored matcha lattes containing an 
array of impossible-to-pronounce boost-
ers and vitamins. At five foot with a body 
developing softer curves, I couldn’t help but 
wonder why I didn’t look like the women 
doing squats on my iPhone screen. 
As my spiral into social media deepened, 
I downloaded Lose it! — an iPhone app with 
a scale emoji as the logo. The first thing you 
see when you log in is their tagline: “Weight 
loss that fits.” The app requires you enter 
your starting weight and goal weight, then 
an algorithm comes up with the number of 
calories you should consume each day in 
order to reach your intended goals. The app 
fails to take into account any other health 
information — I grew up with a disease 
called hypothyroidism, one that requires 
specific dietary restrictions and regiment-
ed food plans in order to maximize my 
health. The app didn’t know this and never 
would. 
You track calories by entering every-
thing you eat in a day. The setup is easy: 
Lose it! acknowledges all major brand 
food and chain restaurant meals as well. 
Once you start, it’s hard to stop. Counting 
calories became an obsession — the first 
thought of my morning and the last thought 
of my day. The idea of not entering a meal’s 
calorie total becomes far off, unimaginable. 
As you add meals and snacks, your calories 
decrease until you reach zero, meaning you 
shouldn’t eat anymore. If you go beyond 
zero, you have a negative sign, indicating 
you’ve eaten more than your allotted calo-
ries. The concept of breaking below zero is 
terrifying, even if you have your calories set 
to 1,100 per day as I did in 2010. 
I remember downloading the app, 

shielding my phone from 
my friends as baskets of 
chicken fingers were set 
down in front of our ado-
lescent faces. I googled 
things like, “how many 
ounces in four chicken 
fingers” and “how many 
tablespoons is a serving 
of honey mustard,” which 
would be the beginning 
of hundreds of similar 
searches. To avoid ques-
tions from my friends, I 
ordered the brownie when 
they did, shakily entering 
it into my app, swallowing 
the sugary consequences. 
Lose it! quickly turned 
into 
MyFitnessPal, 
a 
more specific application 
in the calorie counting 
and weekly notifications 
reminding me to “step on 
the scale.” I lowered my 
calories to 800. I used it 
for weeks and deleted it 
for days, hoping to end the 
vicious cycle and eat without restriction 
and anxiety. 
The 
app 
has 
been 
proven 
popu-
lar, Forbes recorded over 150 million 
accounts in 2018. That being said, for me, 
it became a dark tunnel in which I could 
never find my bearings. Adding up calories, 
tracking workouts and recording my weight 
became a daily occurrence — a thoughtless 
routine. It didn’t lead me to the results I 
craved, instead, I had headaches from lack 
of nutrition and struggled to get a grip on 
the thing I never thought would be a prob-
lem: food. 
Physically, I appeared as though I didn’t 
have eating problems, but I suffered men-
tally, fearing to put anything in my mouth 
I couldn’t record with ease. Restaurant 
meals and undisclosed calories terrified 
me. By college, eating out or drinking cock-
tails made a heat creep up my neck. I opted 
instead for foods I could measure with my 
measuring tools at home and labels that told 
me exactly what I was eating. I was lauded 
by MyFitnessPal for a streak of recording 
my full day of eating, and I didn’t want my 
streak to end. This obsession began because 
an iPhone app built off internalized patri-
archal messages, dedicated to “wellness,” 
dictated my every move. Nobody knew. It 
was between me and the screen.
As I continued down the path of “health-
based” destruction, wellness culture con-
tinued to gain speed. I thought I was the 
epitome of health as my life passed me by 
while I spent hours a day adding calories 
and stalking the Instagram accounts of the 
women whose bodies I envied. I was idoliz-
ing wellness Instagram bloggers like Rachel 
Mansfield and Kayla Itsines who made 

their living convincing young women like 
me to buy into their diets and “wellness 
fads” — plant-based meals, celery juices and 
intermittent fasting. I bought their skin-
care products, their paleo pancake mixes 
and their natural laxative tea. I spent half 
of my free time scrolling through accounts 
that appeared light and happy —full of col-
orful juices and shirtless mirror selfies. The 
other half of my day was spent on spin bikes 
and treadmills, measuring out plain Greek 
yogurt and almond butter. 
The wellness bloggers I idolized and 
envied for their Instagram pages were the 
fast lane, the gateway drug, the tip of the 
iceberg for my own wellness demise. So 
many young women suffer from destruc-
tive eating tactics and orthorexia as col-
lateral of the boom of the wellness trend. 
The National Eating Disorders Associa-
tion recognizes orthorexia, a condition 
with symptoms of obsessive behavior in 
the pursuit of “health” or “wellness.” The 
societal push toward thinness and the age 
of social media make Instagram the perfect 
place to put the eating disorders and disor-
dered eating of wellness bloggers on display 
— making them normal, beautiful and even 
envy-worthy. 
Lee Tilghman (@leeforamerica) was one 
of these idols for me. I spent hours of my life 
staring at her thin legs and yoga-toned abs, 
her charcoal lattes and plates full of avo-
cado and spinach. After a six-month hiatus 
from her Instagram account over a year ago, 
Tilghman reentered the social media world 
with a deeply personal blog post apologiz-
ing for the way the wellness practices she 
preached were obsessive and destructive to 
her followers. 
Wellness blogging and eating disorders 
are not mutually exclusive. MyFitnessPal and 
Lose It! work the same way. Wellness culture 
can lead to hours of body scrutiny and an 
11-year-old to spend the last ten years of her 
life obsessed with a word that truly means 
nothing: calories. But the wellness industry 
can also inspire and influence positively. I 
would be lying to you if I said I unfollowed 
wellness Instagram accounts, deleted MyFit-
nessPal or if I stopped counting calories. The 
truth is I’m aware of the effects of these plat-
forms on my life. I know what they’ve afford-
ed me and the darkness we walked toward 
together, hand in hand, toward a world of 
thigh gaps. I had to learn how to prohibit an 
Instagram persona and a weight-loss applica-
tion from being the pinnacle of how I lived my 
life. I was born with a disease (hypothyroid-
ism) which causes my metabolism to work 
slowly and has burdened my eating habits my 
entire life. Stalking skinny people on Insta-
gram has no real agency over my own health 
or weight loss. I had to learn that a number on 
a scale or specifically curated amount of calo-
ries is no basis for my self worth and it never 
will be. I simply needed to listen to my body. 
I’ve needed to all along.
