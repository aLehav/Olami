Fashion start-up
encourages youth to
go to college
By HILLARY CRAWFORD
Daily StaffReporter
In America, one student drops
out of high school every 26 seconds,
according to the America's Promise
Alliance.
David Merritt, a University alum
and former captain of the Universi-
ty's basketball team, took these cold
statistics to heart when he founded
Merit Goodness, Inc., a cause-
based clothing line that donates 20
percent of its revenue to help create
scholarships for high-school stu-
dents at the Jalen Rose Leadership
Academy.
In the past, Merit has operated as
an exclusively online retailer. This
will soon change, as the company
has plans to move to a storefront
location on South University Ave-
nue in the next month.
The corporation itself has two

facets: Merit, the actual clothing
line, and FATE, which deals with
donations as well as a mentorship
and outreach program for students
at Jalen Rose.
Merritt, who has always been
passionate about education, espe-
cially in urban areas, said he wants
to serve as a catalyst to the improve-
ment of the city's education system.
"My dad has been a pastor in the
city of Detroit for the last 35 years,
and I've always grown up with a big
heart for young people," Merritt
said.
The high-school students who
are interested in the mentorship
program are assigned to a Univer-
sity student mentor and promised
a $5,000 scholarship when they
graduate.
Merritt said the "big idea" is to
bring awareness to education. By
incorporating fashion to accom-
plish this, Merit is able to commer-
cialize its mission and promote a
greater understanding of the stu-
dents who will benefit from the
program.

complimentary cookies, fruit
and apple cider and left their
mark at the President's House
by signing a guest book.
In April, Coleman
announced her intention to
retire at the end of her term in
July 2014 - making this her
last open house. In an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily
after the event, Coleman said
although she would have pre-
ferred to have a longer time
to talk with each student she
met, she always looks forward

to the event.
"We'll have other oppor-
tunities to (meet students)
throughout the year as well
because it's really important
for me to be able to interact
with the students - and I love
that," Coleman said. "That's
the most fun part of this job."
As in past years, Coleman
and E. Royster Harper, vice
president for student affairs,
will continue to host fireside
chats during the fall semester

ENTREPRENEURSHIP
White House praises
'U' for start-up spirit

Lengthy blog
* post addresses
entrepreneurship
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
Since Beyonc4 lit up the Big
House last weekend with a
hearty "Go Blue," the Univer-
sity has received another round
of big-name accolades.

Last Friday, the White House
Office of Science and Technol-
ogy dedicated a lengthy blog
post to the University's recent
emphasis on entrepreneurship,
jumpstarted last year by former
Central Student Government
President Manish Parikh.
The post - written by a
White House intern - pointed
out multiple University groups,
such as the Center for Entre-
preneurship, that were inspired
by President Barack Obama's

proclamation of a "National
Entrepreneurship Month" last
year. The White House specifi-
cally mentioned the University's
first-ever Month of Entrepre-
neurship, which included 30
innovation-themed events last
April.
"The original goal of the
Month was to bring interesting
entrepreneurs together, but it
grew into more than that - it
started a dialogue about entre-

To a crowd of about 60 stu-

Alan Bersin, assistant secre-

tary of international affairs and
chief diplomatic officer for the
U.S. Department of Homeland
Security, added his voice to the

After being introduced by

his talk, "Managing Global Bor-

is relevant considering recent
controversial disclosures of

classified information byformer
U.S. security contractor Edward

Spacecraft makes
history after traveling
11.5-billion miles
LOS ANGELES (AP) -
NASA's Voyager 1 probe has left
the solar system, boldly going
where no machine has gone
before.
Thirty-six years after it
rocketed away from Earth, the
plutonium-powered spacecraft
has escaped the sun's influence
and is now cruising 11 1/2 bil-
lion miles away in interstellar
space, or the vast, cold empti-
ness between the stars, NASA
said Thursday.
And just in case it encoun-
ters intelligent life out there,
it is carrying a gold-plated,
1970s-era phonograph record
with multicultural greet-
ings from Earth, photos and
songs, including Chuck Berry's
"Johnny B. Goode," along with
Beethoven, Bach, Mozart and
Louis Armstrong.
Neverbefore hasaman-made
object left the solar system as it
is commonly understood.
"We made it," said an ecstat-
ic Ed Stone, the mission's chief
scientist, who waited decades

for this moment.
NASA celebrated by playing
the "Star Trek" theme at a news
conference in Washington.
Voyager 1 actually made its
exit more than a year ago, sci-
entists said. But since there's
no "Welcome to Interstellar
Space" sign out there, NASA
waited for more evidence before
concluding that the probe had
in fact broken out of the hot
plasma bubble surrounding the
planets.
Voyager 1, which is about the
size of a small car, is drifting in
a part of the universe littered
with the remnants of ancient
star explosions.
It will study exotic particles
and other phenomena and will
radio the data back to Earth,
where the Voyager team awaits
the starship's discoveries. It
takes about 17 hours for its sig-
nal to reach Earth.
While Voyager 1 may have
left the solar system as most
people understand it, it still has
hundreds, perhaps thousands,
of years to go before bidding
adieu to the last icy bodies that
make up our neighborhood.
At the rate it is going, it would
take 40,000 years to reach the
nearest star, Alpha Centauri.

Voyager i's odyssey began in
1977whenthe spacecraft andits
twin, Voyager 2, were launched
on a tour of the gas giant plan-
ets of the solar system.
After beaming back daz-
zling postcard views of Jupi-
ter's giant red spot and Saturn's
shimmering rings, Voyager 2
hopscotched to Uranus and
Neptune. Meanwhile, Voyager
1 used Saturn as a gravitational
slingshot to power itself past
Pluto.
Last year, scientists monitor-
ing Voyager 1 noticed strange
happenings that suggested the
spacecraft had broken through:
Charged particles streaming
from the sun suddenly van-
ished. Also, there was a spike in
galactic cosmic rays bursting in
from the outside.
Since there was no detect-
able change in the direction
of the magnetic field lines, the
team assumed the far-flung
craft was still in the helio-
sphere, or the vast bubble of
charged particles around the

0I

sun.
The Voyager team patiently
waited for a change in magnetic
field direction - thought to be
the telltale sign of a cosmic bor-
der crossing.

An American who became one

rebels and was on the FBI's Most
WantedTerroristlistwitha$5 mil-
lion bounty on his head was killed
Thursday by rivals in the al-Qaida-
linked extremist group al-Shabab,
militants said.
The killing of Omar Hammami,
an Alabama native known for his
rap-filled propaganda videos, may
discourage other would-be jihadis
from the U.S. and elsewhere from
traveling to Somalia, terrorism
experts said.
Hammami, whose nom de
guerre was Abu Mansoor Al-Amri-
ki, or "the American," was killed
in an ambush in southern Somalia
following months on the run after
falling out with al-Shabab's top
leader, the militants said.
Reports of Hammami's death
have cropped up every few months
in Somalia, only for him to resur-

face. But J.M. Berger, a U.S. terror-
ism expert who closely follows the
inner workings of al-Shabab, said
he thinks the current reports are
accurate.

to engage with individual stu-
dents. The University randomly
selects a diverse group of under-
graduates and graduates each
month for an informal question-
and-answer period with the two
administrators.
Although students did not line
up to meet her specifically, Harp-
er made her way down the queue
for Coleman, tray in hand, offer-
ing cookies to those waiting. The
30-minute wait to greet Cole-
man gave her ample time to talk
with students about their experi-
ences at the University. Harper is
responsible for overseeing a host
of units, ranging from Housing to
coordinating with the University
Health Service and managing the
Unions and recreational centers.
Harper said Coleman will

strive to spend as much time
with students as possible before
the end of her tenure. With a
target of $1 billion for financial
aid initiatives in the upcom-
ing capital campaign, and more
than $1 billion spent on student
life facilities during her presi-
dency, Harper said Coleman has
demonstrated an immense com-
mitment to the quality of stu-
dent life at the University.
"She's really been a president
that has a heart for students, and
I think that's what we're seeing,"
Harper said. "She loves them, and
they love her."
Business senior Lindsey
Levinson and LSA senior Pamela
Safirstein waited in the unchar-
acteristic September heat to meet
Coleman for the first and prob-
ably last time, since, as Levinson
put it, she "will be graduating
with us."
"She's done great things for

this school and has been very
supportive of all different types
of activities, from Ross and the
Athletics Department, to making
the school more environmentally
friendly," Safirstein said.
While Levinson and Safirst-
ein spent their college careers
under Coleman's leadership,
Rackham student Jenny Shay
said she hoped to introduce her-
self to Coleman as a first-year
graduate student. Although
Shay is new to campus, she
researched Coleman's work
and was impressed - especially
with how Coleman handled the
2003 affirmative action cases
before the Supreme Court.
"I think opening her home to
everybody is great," Shay said.
"She seems to be really con-
cerned about the students and
ensuring that Michigan is a pro-
gressive leader in how it treats
its students."

Merritt said he is looking for-

Egyptian official
warns of further
terror attacks
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's
interim president on Thursday
extended a nationwide state
of emergency for two more
months, citing continued secu-
rity concerns, as a senior Egyp-
tian official warned of more
terrorist attacks in the wake of
a failed assassination attempt
against the interior minister
and suicide bombings in the
Sinai Peninsula.
The nearly month-old state
of emergency, which is due to
expire within days, preserves
greater powers for security
forces amid a crackdown on
supporters of ousted President
Mohammed Morsi and increas-
ing violence by Islamic mili-
tants. It was first declared in
mid-August after authorities
cleared two protest encamp-
ments held by Morsi support-

claimed the lives of nearly
1,000 in subsequent days.
Ever since, a nighttime cur-
few has also been in effect
in much of the country. The
interim government will
decide separately on whether
to continue the curfew. Interim
Prime Minister Hazem el-Beb-
lawi has said the curfew, now
lasting for 7 hours most nights,
would likely be eased.
The government Thurs-
day announced new measures
aimed at easing an economic
crunch, in a sign it aims to show
that it is tackling the nation's
problems even amid the excep-
tional security conditions.
The measures included

tion costs. They also included
an injection of $ 3.1 billion
budget support to be spent on
infrastructure projects and
employment generation, which
the government says it hopes
will increase economic growth
from the current 2 percent to
3.5 percent.
The spending will largely be
financed from money pledged
by Gulf countries to Egypt after
Morsi's July 3 ouster, the gov-
ernment said.
Egypt's continued politi-
cal instability has badly hit
the country's economy, deci-
mating tourism and direct
foreign investment. In recent
rallies, Morsi supporters have
increasingly sought to find
public backing by evoking the
hard economic conditions and
authorities' failure to improve
people's daily lives.
The extension of the state
of emergency, which allows
police wider powers of arrest,
had been expected. The decree
cited continued security con-
cerns. Under the interim
constitution, the state of emer-
gency can only be imposed for
three months, then must be put
to a public referendum.
For most of the 30-year rule
of Morsi's predecessor, Hosni
Mubarak, Egypt was under
emergency law, lifted only after
Mubarak's ouster.
The extension came days
after the Egyptian military
launched a major offensive in
northern region of Sinai, with
troops backed by helicopter
gunships raiding suspected
hideouts al-Qaida inspired mil-
itants in a dozen villages. The
three-day offensive left 29 mil-
itants dead, demolished houses
and led to the seizure of weap-
ons and explosives, includ-
ing 10 anti-aircraft missiles,
according to military officials.

The second annual event is the

more than 1,200 computer pro-

In an e-mail interview with
The Michigan Daily, Parikh said
he and his colleagues working on
the Month of Entrepreneurship
reached out to the White House
Office of Science and Technol-
ogy Policy about five months
ago to share the initiatives they
had been piloting. Two weeks
ago, the White House contacted
Parikh for an interview and said
they would be interested in fea-
turing the University's campus-
wide entrepreneurial efforts.
The Office of Science and
Technology Policy was created
in 1976 to advise the Executive
Office of the President on the
impacts of science and technolo-

gy on domestic and international
affairs.
Parikh noted that the Uni-
versity's Month of Entrepre-
neurship directly aligns with
Obama's core missions related to
innovation.
"Michigan has among the
most diverse, robust and inter-
disciplinary entrepreneurial
programs in the nation," Parikh
said. "Over the past year, stu-
dent-driven entrepreneurship
has grown to unprecedented
levels. The Obama administra-
tion has really inspired today's
youth to be the torchbearers of a
more entrepreneurial and inno-
vative America."

Michigan Prisoner Reentry Initiative shouldn't be cut
ver the last several decades, the United States has seen its
prison population increase to more than two-million people.
One of the biggest causes of growing incarceration rates in the
United States is repeat offenders. The state of Michigan created a pro-
gram called the Michigan Prisoner Reentry Initiative, aimed at using
community organizations to prevent recidivism among returning citi-
zens. The program helps ex-convicts find stable housing and steady
employment while counseling them on staying out of the penitentiary
system. Despite a great deal of both anecdotal and empirical evidence
displaying the MPRI's success, the Snyder administration has chosen
to cut the initiative's budget almost in half. These types of programs
give attention to the nuanced issues of such marginalized populations
and should be, at the very least, maintained, not weakened.

Michigan prison population has dropped
by more than 16 percent between 2006 and
2011, saving the state hundreds of millions in
its corrections budget. The state has allocated
nearly $2 billion for the Department of Cor-
rections for fiscal year 2014. The MPRI was
given $20 million in 2013 but will see only
$12 million for 2014. Despite the fact that this
relatively inexpensive and effective program
has saved money and helped a vulnerable
population, the state legislature has decided
it isn't worth the cost. Instead of making
investments that save money, help people
and reduce crime, the budget slashed another
important government program.
Over the last three years, the Snyder
administration and the Republican-con-
trolled Michigan state legislature have torn
into some of the state's key programs in the
name of balancing the budget. Secondary
and higher education have seenfunding evis-
cerated, while the .governor has called for
an increased gas tax to pay for road repairs.
The state's budget in recent years has taken

a sharp turn against lower- and middle-class
people, cutting programs that help those
in the toughest situations while proposing
regressive taxes.
Building better schools and taking steps
to reduce crime will exponentially improve
the state. A balanced budget should certainly
be a major priority for a state, especially one
with Michigan's recent economic history.
However, a balanced budget can only do so
much. The state must invest in its people if it
wishes to thrive in the future. There are cur-
rently more than 40,000 people incarcerated
in Michigan, the vast majority of whom will
one day rejoin society. Their chance of finding
a home and a place to work, all while avoiding
falling back into old habits, can be increased
through effective organization and policy.
Giving the MPRI a few million dollars will
stop future crimes, thus improving public
safety and saving the state billions in prison
costs. The state must stop its obsession with
short term budgets and focus on investing in
its people's future.

MICHAEL PUSKARI VIE WPOINT
Eliminate in-state tuition

0

For years,cost hasbeenone ofthe main prob-
lemslimitingstudentsfrom acollege education.
In particular, students settle for a school other
than the best one into which they are accepted
due to high price tags. Much of this problem
has to do with out-of-state tuition being higher
than in-state tuition. This pressures students
to remain in-state, even if out-of-state schools
offer better education.
According to U.S. News and World Report,
28 states do not have a top-50 university and
18 states do not have a top-100 university. For
residents of these states, finding a high-qual-
ity college education may not be an option, as
the differences between in- and out-of-state
tuition can be substantial. Take, for example,
the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill. U.S. News and World Report ranks it
as the 30th-best university in the U.S. and
the fifth-best public university in the United
States. Its in-state tuition is $7,694 per year,
but its out-of-state tuition is $28,446 - that's
nearly four times as high.
These high differences in tuition costs
discourage students from attending the best
school. Not only is this price discrimination
unfair, it hurts these individuals in the long
run. This can lead to lower-quality education,
and, therefore, lower-paying, less successful
careers for these individuals. Lower-quality
educations also hurt the economy, as a lesser
educated workforce is usually a less produc-
tive workforce.
Instead, the practice of discriminating
against students by charging more for out-
of-state tuition should be stopped. This will
level the playing field, improve fairness and
lead to a better education system. Under such
a plan, all students in the country will have
access to the best schools. This will also pro-
duce more competition among schools, driv-
ing costs down and quality up. Under the
current system, the best public university in
each state has an advantage in attracting in-

state students. Thus, there is little incentive
for these schools to drive down the cost of
attendance or to improve its quality of educa-
tion further due to a lack of competition from
comparable schools. Removing these schools'
cost advantages against out-of-state schools
for students will give these schools a greater
incentive to lower their costs and to improve.
Currently, states are afraid to practice such
measures as they worry about their students
having costs unfairly slated against them. If
just one state charged the same price for in-
state and out-of-state students but the others
did not, then the students of that state will
have to compete with students from out of
state to go to that state's public schools, but
will still have to pay out of state tuition if they
themselves go out of state. This could lead to
these students failing to get into their state's
best public school and not having the money
to go to other states' best schools, leadingto a
decline in the average education that state's
students receive. The way to get around this
problem is to have all states stop their price
discrimination with a federal law.
States may worry that this would lead to
students, and therefore money, leaving their
states as students go to other states for col-
lege. This would largely be counteracted by
students from other states coming to that
state's own schools. If states want to attract
more students and money into their own
states, then they should improve their aca-
demics at their universities to attract stu-
dents from other states. This could also solve
other problems, such as the controversy of
whether to charge undocumented immi-
grants in-state or out-of-state tuition. Instead
of wasting time having this debate, just get-
ting rid of out of state tuition should solve
this problem. It's long overdue that we pass
tuition equality, but late is better than never.

As I write, I imagine my friend
Joshua Sider in full combat gear,
running time trials up and down
Israeli sand dunes. If this last year
had gone differently - had Sider
not postponed his admission to the
University of Michigan; had he not
instead gone to Jerusalem for an
experiential education in the Arab-
Israeli conflict; had Sider not spoken
with Jewish Israelis, Arab Israelis,
Arab Zionists, Jewish anti-Zionists,
etc.; had he not visited the death
camps and concentrations camps
in Eastern Europe - perhaps Sider
would be moving into Alice Lloyd or
East Quad Residence Hall this week.
Instead, on Aug. 9, Sider's airplane
kicked its wheels up from Detroit
Metropolitan Airport, and he began
his three-or-more year bid in the
Israeli Defense Force.
The University accepted Sider
days before Christmas 2011, like they
accepted me and most of our other
friends from suburban Detroit -
Huntington Woods and West Bloom-
field, Michigan, to be specific. But
Sider decided not to enroll in class-
es for the Fall 2012 semester, and,
in July of this year, Sider officially
declined his offer to Michigan.
The University, as well as friends,
family and foes, were asking: Why?
Why do this? Why go to war in far
off land, for a country that you aren't
a citizen of, ina bloody, volatile con-
flict that has little chance of being
(peacefully) resolved soon (or ever)?
His grandparents asked him if it was
because he worried about nothaving
friends in college. "Don't you like it
in Ann Arbor?" they wondered.
Unlike a few other Americans
I know that have joined the IDF,

Sider doesn't seem motivated by
prejudice against Arabs or hunger
for bloody vengeance. Sider said his
decision rested on logic, thoughtful
deliberation and his principles. As
I alluded to earlier, Sider's Arab-.
Israeli conflict program introduced
him to a diverse range of perspec-
tives. Sider witnessed firsthand
the state of things in Israel, and
the condition of Jewish people in
Israel, Europe and parts of Africa.
He learned more about the history
of his people and the Jewish state
than could be learned in a book.
So when Sider returned for the
holidays last winter, he returned
resolute. He had carefully prepared
his reasons, anticipating his parents'
critical response and tears. When
I spoke with him, Sider told me his
reasons for joining the IDF. In my
friendly contrarian way, I challenged
his arguments, but in the end, we
agreed that his decision made sense
for him. Where I come from, Sider
is a rebel, an independent thinker
and an anomaly. Summer-camp-
attending, backyard-basketball-
playing, college-education-funded
upper-middle-class-Jewish kids
like us don't fight in wars. My mom
wouldn't even let me play full-con-
tact football growing up. Kids like us
are supposed to watch Woody Allen
films and joke about being our high
school's freestyle fleeing champions.
If the draft returned, we're supposed
to run away to Canada or exempt
ourselves with our college-student
status. But, alas, Sider independently
sought out military service.
I believe Sider's story can be use-
ful and helpful for anyone, but espe-
cially college-age people. At a time

when so many of us are lost in one
way or another, Sider has already
confidently chosen his life's direc-
tion. He seems sure of who he is
and what he's doing. On the other
hand, what the fuck am I doing?
The direction of my life's next four
years are anybody's guess. Writer?
Surgeon? College-educated hermit?
Who the fuck knows? Sider is pret-
ty much set. He'll be an Israel sol-
ider with sturdy principles. Unlike
skeptical and contrarian me, who
spends more time challenging his
principles than acting upon them,
Sider will be championing a cause
in which he believes. I applaud him
for that. Say what you will about the
Arab-Israeli conflict; our opinions
of it are irrelevant to the beauty and
greatness of Sider's tale.
So what's the moral? Maybe Sid-
er's story is a reminder of how much
one person is willing to do, and can
do, for his cause. Maybe it's to dis-
suade our fear of risks, threats and
obstacles in pursuing our goals.
Maybe. I don't know. But it definite-
ly gives me a sense of urgency about
establishing my life objectives, pas-
sions, etc. If I am indeed "lost," in an
adolescent, whole-life-ahead-of-me,
emotional teenager kind of way,then
maybe remembering Sider's ongoing
adventure pushes me toward being
"found;" that is, toward finding pur-
pose and direction.
This has been a friendly salute
to Joshua Sider, born and raised
in Huntington Woods, Mich., now
training and fighting in Undis-
closed Location, Israel.
Good luck, brother.

ence. And we can take that any-

In response to this shortage
of venues, Charles has encour-
aged his students at Michigan
State to create their own spaces.
While the students of the Michi-
gan State Jazz Studies Program
have university spaces like con-
cert halls to perform, the greater
East Lansing community, for a
while, lacked its own jazz ven-
ues.
"When I started teaching,
students came to me saying,
'We don't have any places to
play,' " Charles said. "And I said,
'Well, go find some.' We put on
our suits and went to the nicest
restaurant in town and said we
want to play some jazz for you.
We'll play for X amount of dol-
lars and dinner. And they were
like, 'OK, fine.' And we'd do it for
a little while, and some of them
caught on and some of them
didn't. There was one place we
played every Saturday night for
four years. It became the jazz
club in town."
Despite this shortage, Charles
is optimistic about the Michi-
gan jazz scene, a scene that,
with Baker's Keyboard Lounge
in Detroit, boasts of the world's
oldest operating jazz club.
"There's definitely a great
culture of jazz in Michigan, and
it's heavily rooted in tradition,
but there's a lot of innovation,"
Charles said.
Much of the continuation of
this legacy will likely come from
the schools.
"There is a high level of musi-
cianship among young musi-
cians in the state of Michigan,"
Charles said.
"The level is extremely high at
(Michigan State)," Charles said.
"I'm not just saying that because
I teach there. It's just based on
the community aspect of it. It's
like a family. Every year it sees
students grow, and when they
leave, we miss them."

Overall, it's a fantastic film.
Delving nto Lake Bell's
ambitious 'World'


By KAYLA UPADHYAYA
ManagingArts Editor
Lake Bell is trying to tell us
something. I was first introduced
to the pervasive actor during
her season-one arc on "Boston
Legal," butI first fell in love with
her as Cat Black, the occasional
nudist, occasional dead doctor on
Rob Corddry's wickedly hilari-
ous medical satire, "Childrens
Hospital." Bell's certainly recog-
nizable, having appeared in vari-
ous romcoms in recent years, and
she's beloved in the comedy com-
munity. But if her feature film
"In a World . "is any indication,
she's also an emerging director
we should all be tuning into.
In her directorial debut -
which she also wrote and stars
in - Bell introduces us to the
faces behind trailer and com-
mercial voiceovers. This prem-
ise tricks us into believing the
film is confined to a niche world.
The voiceover realm is relatively
unexplored by cinema, and Bell
gets points for singularity. But
the film expertly navigates a
balance between specificity and
breadth, making it both the most
charming and piercing movie I
saw all summer.
Let's start with the details. Bell
populates "World" with infec-
tiously quirky characters, first
and foremost with her own char-
acter, Carol, who hopes to be the
next big thing in voice acting.
Her father Sam (Fred Melamed),
a voiceover superpower himself,
insists voiceover work has no
roomfor women,and her competi-
tion, the eccentric and crude Gus-
tav (Ken Marino, who has become
a maestro at playing douchebags),
agrees. Demetri Martin plays
bumbling sound guy Louis, whose
crush on Carol never dips too far
into incessant nice-guy territory.
He's joined in the sound booth by
deadpan Heners (King of Dead-
pan himself, Nick Offerman), the
super-eager, sloppy-drunk Nancy
(UCB vet Stephanie Allynne) and
Cher (a rare onscreen appearance
by comedian Tig Notaro).
Now, zoom out. The arena in
which these characters operate
mightinitiallyseem confining,but
Bell maneuvers them in ways that
probe and comment on a much
larger world. The gender politics
at play in vocal performance are

The snozzberries taste like snozzberries.
Mik e iLL makes

"I'm an adult.'
Is she just

Cyrus, Juicy J and
Khalifa unite
to disappoint
By GIBSON JOHNS
OnlineArtsEditor
Earlier this week, Mike WiLL
Made It - the in-demand produc-
er behind hits like Kanye West's
"Mercy" and Miley Cyrus's "We
Can't Stop" - premiered "23," the
lead single off of his debut album.
The club-ready hip-hop track
sees the producer team back up
with Cyrus, and also features Wiz
Khalifa and Juicy J.
A tribute to Michael Jordan,
his iconic jrsey humber and sig-
nature Nikes, "'23" kicks off with
quite the hook from Cyrus, who
sings, "I'm
in the club First seen on
high off
purp with --the filter

some shades on / Tatted up, mini-
skirt with my J's on." Some would
call it singing, some would call it
her version of rapping, but either
way it remains in line with the
image she has been projecting as
of late: naughty, shameless and,
well, baffling.
Cyrus goes on to sing (actually
singing this time and much more
pleasantly to the ear), "Put on
my J's and dance the whole night
away / I'm naughty by nature
like I'm hip-hop hooray." She's
more than proven her point and,
although it's a catchy one, it feels
slightly out of place on "23."
Khalifa's verse proves just as
unimaginative, though: "Pro ath-
lete I'm not no wannabe / Wait-
ress asked how many bottles? I
said 23." I realize it's supposed to
be a poppin' bottles-worthy trib-
ute to the legend that is Michael
Jordan, but could Khalifa really
not think of something more cre-
ative than this? These lyrics don't

do Number 23 justice.
Juicy J keeps the momentum
going with lines like "I'm so
fly, I'm gettin' head like a blow
dryer" in the third verse which
is followed by more of the Miley
madness. The track feels like a
disappointment because, really,
shouldn't such a huge collabo-
ration yield something stronger
than this?
Mike WILL Made It has
been killin' the game recently
and Wiz, Juicy J and Miley are
all hot right now in their own
rights. Don't get me wrong -
"23" is clever at times and could
undoubtedly get a party going
with its bouncy beat. But is it
memorable? Not in the slightest.
It looks like that other little song
they did, "We Can't Stop," will
still have to do - for now.

What to watch for: Akron

ByZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
While you munch on glazed
donuts at Saturday's game, or fast
for Yom Kippur while trying to
ignore those munching on glazed
donuts at Saturday's game, here's
what to focus on:
Will the pass rush finally show
up?
The depth of this year's defen-
sive linemen has allowed defen-
sive coordinator Greg Mattison
to use an unusually large rota-
tion this season. That makes
Michigan's lack of a pass rush a
bit more unsettling.
Mattison wants his front four
to win one-on-ones, so that he
can pressure quarterbacks with-
out sending extra men. They
haven't so far.
The Wolverines have five
sacks in the first two games.
That's a perfectly respectable
number. The defensive line itself,
though, has just one sack.
Against Notre Dame, Michi-
gan only recorded one sack. Ear-
lier this week, Michigan coach
Brady Hoke explained that Notre
Dame goes to great lengths to
protect quarterback Tommy
Rees, so the Wolverines were
content to sit back in coverage.
That's a sound strategy, and it
accounts for the lack of pressure
on Rees in the game. But it also
shows thatthe defensive linewas
largely ineffective without extra
help.
Most concerningofallisjunior
defensive end Frank Clark. Clark
has had a solid, if unremarkable,
first two games. He faced one
of the better tackles he will see
against Notre Dame. Michigan
expects more than solid out of
Clark, though.
In the spring and into the fall,
coaches and players raved about
their dynamic rush end. Clark

Junior defensive end Frank Clark set a personal goal for double-digit sacks before the season. So far, he has zero.

himself said he seta goal of dou-
ble-digit sacks for the season.
So far: zero sacks, two tackles
and two hurries. He has erred lit-
tle, but he hasn't been the spark
most expected.
If he can't beat a porous Akron
line, who can he beat?
Is the secondary for real?
It was against Notre Dame,
but the statistics were hurt by a
soft defensive scheme: the Irish
had 314 yards passing.
Still, the secondary did near-
ly everything right within the
game plan. It limited yards after
the catch. It prevented the big
play. It tackled very well - think
Raymon Taylor on a key third-
down screen.
The secondary appears to have
no holes. It's hard not to picture
how effective this group will be
with another year of experience
and an infusion of talent from
recruit Jabrill Peppers. But for
now, the unit has still been very
good.
Akron runs an up-tem-
po spread attack. Michigan


shouldn't have to play as soft as
it did against Notre Dame. We
should get a glimpse of how good
the secondary can be.
Will the interior line show
improvement?
Michigan's three interior line-
men struggled against Notre
Dame's talented front seven. Suc-
cessful runs up the middle were
rare. Fifth-year senior running
back Fitzgerald Toussaint, by
most accounts, ran well. Still, he
had just 71 yards on 22 attempts.
At times, redshirt freshman
guard Kyle Kalis looked like a
turnstile.
Redshirt sophomore center
Jack Miller was a bright spot,
but he acknowledged Tuesday
that the line still is searching for
chemistry.
Expect a steady dose of runs
for Michigan on Saturday. James
Madison - yes, FCS James
Madison - rushed for 188 yards
against Akron last week. The
Wolverines should have no trou-
ble. If they do, there is cause for
concern.

What will Gardner and Gallon
do for an encore?
It speaks volumes about red-
shirt junior Devin Gardner's per-
formance that he made one of the
worst mistakes you'll ever see on
a football field, and Sports Illus-
trated still moved him up to No.
16 on its mock NFL Draft board.
That's because Gardner had
one of the better performances
by a Michigan quarterback in
recent memory. He threw for 294
yards and four touchdowns and
rushed for another 82 yards and
a score. He looked like an NFL-
caliber quarterback.
And fifth-year senior wide
receiver Jeremy Gallon might
have had an even better night. He
had eight catches for 184 yards
and three touchdowns - one of
Michigan's best receiving per-
formances.
Gallon is nursing a hamstring
injury he sustained on Saturday.
And even healthy, it would be
difficult to surpass the night he
and Gardner had against Notre
Dame. Can they top it against the
Zips' less-than-stellar defense?

. Michigan overcomes slow start

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan started slowly again
Thursday, going into halftime
tied at zero with Detroit. But the
Wolverines keep winning, mak-
ing the fin-
ish all that DETROIT 0
matters. MICHIGAN 2
Senior
defender Shelina Zadorsky
scored her first goal of the sea-
son to lead No. 11 Michigan to a
2-0 home win.
The Wolverines are now 6-0
on the season, the best start
in program history. They also
capped a perfect season-opening
homestand heading into their
first road game Sunday at Butler.
Before Zadorsky's go-ahead
goal, Michigan struggled to
generate scoring opportuni-
ties early, as coach Greg Ryan
noted earlier this season. It took
until the 34th minute for fresh-
man forward Nicky Waldeck to
record the Wolverines' first shot
on goal.
Michigan lacked precision in
the first half but kent the game

scoreless with its defense.
"You'd see passes into (senior
forward) Nkem (Ezurike) in the
box, but they were just a foot
away from her and she couldn't
get a foot on them," Ryan said.
"Normally, we're making those
passes to her feet, and she's able
to turn and get shots off. I felt
like we were just a little bit off in
terms of our accuracy."
The Wolverines won the pos-
session battle and kept the ball in
the attacking half, but although
Michigan moved the ball up and
down the flanks, it couldn't get
opportunities in the box due to
tight defense from Detroit (2-4-
1).
"First half, we just didn't
seem to have that determination
to really take it to the goal and
put it away," Ryan said. "We got
in the box several times, but it
just wasn't the real commitment
to put the ball in the net. Second
half, I really felt like there was
commitment throughout the
half."
In the 56th minute, Zadorsky
moved over to the right half of
the field from left back and ham-

mered a shot inside the left post.
"It just bounced back to the
right side," Zadorsky said, "and
I took a touch inside and hit it
with my left."
Ezurike added an insurance
tally in the 89th minute by turn-
ing past a defender and hitting a
shot off the cross bar and down.
"I think Nkem was really frus-
trated - things were just a little
off," Ryan said. "Boy, did she
catch that last one. She almost
ripped the net off."
A lights-out defensive effort
limited the Titans to only two
shots - Michigan's new season
low - with none on goal and
none in the first half. Senior
Kayla Mannino started on
defense for the second straight
game, but Michigan's biggest
lineup change came at halftime,
when Ryan moved Mannino to
left midfield and put sophomore
Sydney Raguse at center back.
Mannino fired a point-blank
redirect at Detroit goalie Mar-
tha Dunbar in the 49th minute,
and the Wolverines' goal came
minutes later.
Trving to reach the right com-

bination, Ryan made seven sub-
stitutions in the first half. Still,
senior defender Holly Hein,
junior defender Chloe Sosen-
ko, senior midfielder Meghan
Toohey and Zadorsky each
played 90 minutes as Michigan
continued to move towarda per-
manent startinglineup.
The Wolverines finished with
a season-high 27 shots, only eight
of which were on goal. Ryan said
he continues to emphasize more
precise finishing.
"It's just focus," Ezurike said.
"They weren't off by much, so it's
just that little extra focus to get
it on target."
Now, Michigan travels on
the road for the first time for a
matchup with Butler (4-1-2).
After that, the Wolverines
open their much-anticipated Big
Ten schedule, when Zadorsky
said the team will have to come
out with more intensity.
"We can't afford to lose a
game like this tonight," Zador-
sky said. "We've got to focus for
those 90 minutes, that specific
game. We're really looking for-
ward to starting the Big Ten."

Senior forward Rachael Mack leads the Wolverines with four goals this season.

In the first weekend of the
season, the Michigan women's

the first time
- according
to Michigan
coach Mark Rosen, the schedule
couldn't be set up any better.
Friday, the Wolverines travel
to College Station, Texas for the
* Texas A&M Invitational, where
Michigan will face the host
Aggies, Siena and No. 16 Florida
State in a span of just 24 hours.
"(The schedule) really sets
up well," Rosen said. "Now we
have to deal with a football game
atmosphere at Texas A&M, just
like we had last week."
Before last Saturday after-
noon's game against the Ducks,
the Wolverines unveiled their
2012 national semifinalist ban-
ner in front of a raucous crowd
of 1,345. The atmosphere and
large crowd were largely aided
by the excitement and influx
of Michigan fans in Ann Arbor
for the football team's Saturday
night game against Notre Dame,
an advantage that Rosen readily
admitted.
"What a great atmosphere,"
Rosen said. "The crowd, just the
spiritofMichigangoingso strong
... It makes you feel great about
playing in a place like Michigan
when you have that opportunity
to play in an environment like
that."
The Wolverineswill get ataste
of their own medicine on Friday,
when they face off against Texas
A&M. College Station is expect-
ing an influx of fans from around
the state and country through-
out the weekend for the Aggies'
high-profile gridiron clash with
No. 1 Alabama, meaning the
crowd at Reed Arena should be
particularly large and boisterous.
"We got a taste of that (envi-
ronment) at Xavier," Cole said.
"It's definitely a big factor."
The seventh-ranked Wolver-
ines (5-0) were dominant in their

first three games of the year' at
the Xavier Invitational in Cin-
cinnati, beating Clemson, Xavier
and Northern Kentucky all in
straight sets.
They then returned to Ann
Arbor for their home-opening
weekend, which featured a
tougher pair of matchups with
two Pac-12 schools: Oregon State
and then-No. 12 Oregon. The
Beavers gave Michigan trouble
on Friday night, earning a win in
the fourth set before succumb-
ing to defensive pressure from
freshman middle blocker Abby
Cole, who tallied 16 kills and nine
blocks on the night.
The Wolverines swept Oregon
on Saturday afternoon, but the
three-set victory belied the fact
that the match was likely their
closest of the year - Michigan
didn't win a set by more than four
points.
Michigan will have to contend
with more than just a hostile
environment against the Aggies
and Seminoles. Texas A&M is 6-1
so far, with its loss coming to No.
15 Iowa State. Meanwhile, Flor-
ida State is likely the ACC's best
team, and the Seminoles will be
lookingto avoid a second straight
loss to a Big Ten school - they
fell to No. 13 Ohio State last Fri-
day.
The Wolverines struggled
away from the friendly confines
of Cliff Keen Arena last season,
posting a record of 6-7 in road
games and going 2-3 in away
matchups against ranked teams.

Cole looks to play a big role in
ensuring Michigan's road record
doesn't suffer the same fate
in 2013. She'll face off against
another young, highly touted
middle blocker in Texas A&M's
Shelby Sullivan, who posted a
career-high six blocks to go along
with nine kills in the Aggies'
sweep of Siena on Thursday.
The Wolverines will have
to watch out for Florida State's
dynamic duo of Nicole and Elise
Walch. The sisters from Stuart,
Fla., have paced the Seminoles
offensively and have already
posted 71 and 52 kills, respec-
tively, on the young season.
What's even more impressive is
that Nicole leads the team in kills
despite her relatively low hitting
percentage of .214, meaning that
if her accuracy improves against
Michigan, she'll be a force to be
reckoned with.
Freshman middle blocker
Gabbie Bulic, who's flown under
the radar largely due to Cole's
impressive start, can also expect
to see more game action at some
point in the near future.
"Gabble's good," Rosen said.
"She hasn't gotten as much
action just because of our depth,
but everybody's going to need to
contribute."
The weekend is key for the
Wolverines in the defense of
their Final Four run last season
- Michigan can expect to climb
into the top five with three wins,
or fall out of the top 10 with a
loss.

MEN'S LACROSSE
Gaughan looking to
make big comeback

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
Brendan Gaughan entered
Michigan as one of the men's
lacrosse team's highest-rated
recruits. But before the season,
Gaughan learned he wouldn't
see the field for at least a year.
While tryingto make time in the
preseason conditioning test, he
planted his leg funny and imme-
diately knew something was
wrong.
After consulting the Michigan
medical staff, Gaughan learned
he tore his meniscus and would
be forced to take a medical red-
shirt.
Gaughan, a redshirt freshman
from Carlsbad, Calif., went from
being ESPN Rise's No. 7 attack-
man to watching the 2013 season
from the bench - a reality check
for a highly regarded player.
His high-school records of
223 points and 137 goals earned
him an invitation to the Under
Armour All-American game
and then to Michigan. But none
of that mattered. Nothing was
guaranteed anymore.
"High school is high school,
and that rank happened,"
Gaughan said. "I'm fortunate for
the publicity I was given, but this
is a new level. This is Michigan,
and it no longer matters how
I

good you were in high school. It's
how good you are in (Division I)."
Spending time on the sidelines
for a whole year could be enough
to ruin a player's morale. How-
ever, Gaughan saw the positives.
He witnessed firsthand the up-
and-down season the lacrosse
team endured.
Even though he couldn't play,
Gaughan knew his sideline ener-
gy would translate to his team-
mates on the field - and that's
just what he did.
And now, finally healthy,
Gaughan looks forward to show-
ing everyone the type of player
he knows he can be.
Only one roadblock, the depth
chart, lies in his way. He is not
currently listed as a starter. But
Gaughan knows his playing time
will come.
"All summer, I was training,
lifting and getting stronger,"
Gaughan said. "I worked on my
lacrosse IQ - no matter how
smart you are, you can be smart-
er. I am always looking to add to
my arsenal and will always try to
improve my shooting.
"But I will back coach John
Paul 100 percent on who plays.
No matter where I am, ISwill give
100 percent. I could not be hap-
pier here."
Could Gaughan's return com-
bined with another star-studded

recruiting class finally bring the
Wolverines more than one win?
Only time will tell.
"We expect to win the ECAC,
beat Ohio State and come out
on top of every game," Gaughan
said. "Winning is our No.1 prior-
ity. Last year, we only won one
game, and I can speak for the
team - we were pretty pissed
off about that. It's growing pains
and frustrating, but the wins will
come."
However, talent alone isn't
enough to guide this team to
success. Gaughan claims that
Paul has created a culture and
standard in which every player
is accountable for one another.
Gaughan believes it's that very
dynamic that will create wins.
Team aside, Gaughan still has
a personal battle to overcome.
The redshirt freshman is fight-
ing to erase his injury from his
mind because it will be harder to
reach his potential if the creep-
ing thought of getting re-injured
remains.
Yet Gaughan claims he's ready.
"I'm going to put the injury
behind me," he said. "Our train-
ing staff is second to none and
has one of the greatest health
facilities out there. I'm doing
everything I can to stay healthy.
"I'm really looking forward to
finally contributing."

Akron Breakdown:
-Backups to see field

Zipping right along

By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
The No. 11 Michigan football
team is a 37-point favorite over
Akron (1-1) after remaining unbeat-
en with a win over Notre Dame
under the lights last weekend. The
coaching staff has said that a let-
down is unlikely because of the
senior leadership that should allow
the team to keep its focus despite
facing a weaker opponent.
This will be the first-ever meet-
ing between the two schools,
though the Wolverines are 32-1
Sall-time against teams currently in.
the Mid-American Conference. It
will also be Michigan's second and
final meeting of the season against
a team from a non-BCS conference.

Through twogames, the Zips are
just outside of the bottom-10 FBS
teams in passing yards allowed.
Against FCS school James Madi-
'AA on, Akron allowed 310 pass-
ing yards and three touchdowns
through the air; defense is clearly
not the Zips' strength.
Meanwhile, the Wolverines'
aerial attack picked apart a Notre
Dame secondary that forced turn-
over after turnover in the two
teams' meeting last year. Redshirt
junior quarterback Devin Gardner
looked far more comfortable than
he did in Week 1 against Central
Michigan, perhaps an indication
that time is what it will take to
limit his mistakes when outside the
pocket.
Gardner and fifth-year senior
wide receiver Jeremy Gallon pose a
formidable duo that should be able
to connect at will against a Zips sec-
ondary that has shown little ability
to stop weaker teams.

The game that followed one of
the biggest spectacles in Michi-
gan football history was going to
be a letdown no matter the oppo-
nent, but it doesn't help that the
Wolverines' opponent Saturday
is a team that barely beat an FCS
opponent last weekend.
Saturday, Akron (1-1) travels
to Ann Arbor for the first time in
program history in a game that
has potential for a letdown but
will almost certainly not be close.
Linesmakers have Michigan (2-0)
as a 37-point favorite, and the ath-
letic department is giving the first
5,000 students that show up free
doughnuts. Something to keep
everyone entertained, at least for
a few minutes.
Last weekend, while Michigan
was battling on national televi-
sion for Under the Lights II, the
Zips were going down to the wire
against James Madison, which
doesn't play at the FBS level.
Akron held on for the win but was
outgained by 150 yards and would
have lost if not for a muffed two-

point conversion.
For Michigan, Saturday will
be another good tune-up and a
chance to get some of the fresh-
men who played against Central
Michigan, but not against Notre
Dame, back on the field. Specifi-
cally, the running back situation
will be interesting to watch.
Against Central Michigan, all
six running backs saw the field,
including freshman Derrick
Green, who ran well enough to
earn himself the lead backup spot
behind fifth-year senior Fitzger-
ald Toussaint. Against Notre
Dame, though, Toussaint got
every carry except for two. Those
went to Green, who lost a yard
and didn't carry the ball again,
and Jeremy Gallon on a reverse.
That won't be the case against
Akron.
"We can get some experience to
some other guys if we're fortunate
enough to do that," said Michigan
coach Brady Hoke. "That would
be a real positive."
Besides just earning field
experience, Hoke says the Zips'
schemes will be a good change of
pace for his younger backup run-
ning backs.
"From a defensive perspective
for them, they're very aggressive,"
Hoke said. "You know, they like to
blitz, they like to play zero cover-
age, they like to play man free. So
they'll stack the line of scrimmage
a little bit and you have to take
advantage of the shots you get."
All jokes aside, every football
team needs games like this. Not
everybody is going to play against
Notre Dame, but everyone will
play against Akron.
That part - the challenge of
depth against a different team -
will be the real test on Saturday.
The final score, however lopsided
it may be, is almost irrelevant.

Freshman running back De'Veon Smith is a backup who might see time Saturday.

developing interior offensive line,
Toussaint didn't have the holes
to run through that he would've
liked, though he still accumulated
71 yards. Freshmen Derrick Green
and De'Veon Smith should see their
workloads increase against a Zips
team that allowed 3.7 yards per
carry against James Madison last
week.
This feels like the type of game
where the offensive line can con-
tinue to learn from game experi-
ence with alot of rushes with ample
success.

former head football coach
knows how to describe the
