SEXUAL ASSAULT POLICY

Online educational 
materials updated 

following Daily 

editorial 

By ALYSSA BRANDON 
and LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporters

Holly 
Ryder-Milkovich, 

director of the University’s Sexual 
Assault Prevention and Awareness 
Center, announced Sunday that 
SAPAC updated its website to 
reflect changes to language used to 
define consent.

The change occurred following 

a Michigan Daily report that 
revealed discrepancies between 
language in the University’s Sexual 
Misconduct Policy and language 
SAPAC promotes and encourages 
students to follow.

The 
Student 
Sexual 

Misconduct Policy says consent 
is a “Clear and unambiguous 
agreement, expressed in mutually 
understandable words or actions, 
to engage in a particular activity. 
Consent can be withdrawn by 
either party at any point.”

SAPAC’s definition is more 

stringent, identifying consent as 
an explicitly verbal agreement, 
not satisfied by silence or body 
language.

In 
an 
editorial 
published 

Wednesday, the Daily’s Editorial 
Board 
voiced 
concerns 
about 

the 
discrepancy 
between 

SAPAC’s and the Student Sexual 
Misconduct Policy’s definitions of 
consent: “While we understand 
that 
SAPAC’s 
definition 
of 

consent is educational and not a 
standard used to hold individuals 
accountable to University policy, 
the large discrepancy between 
the two is troubling; ‘mutually 
understandable words or actions’ 
is too ambiguous,” the Board 
wrote. “The current policy sets 
a dangerously low threshold for 
consent that can be misconstrued 
and misunderstood.”

In an op-ed published in the Daily, 

Rider-Milkovich said SAPAC staff 
have reviewed the organization’s 
educational materials on its website 
to clarify the distinction between 
the University’s policy and the 
standard SAPAC strives to promote.

Students parade a giant, handmade float (LEFT) and the Detroit Party Marching Band performs (RIGHT) at FestiFools on Main Street Sunday.

Eighth annual 

FestiFools focuses 

on nostalgia for 
‘Dejà Fool’ theme 

By ALAINA WYGANT

Daily Staff Reporter

For the eighth year, Ann 

Arborites experienced a case of 
Déjà Fool. Sunday afternoon, 
University students and locals 
alike gathered along Main Street 
to watch a parade of puppets as 
part of FestiFools, a free public 
art spectacle.

This year’s theme was “Déjà 

Fool,” a play on the French phrase 
Déjà vu, or the feeling of having 
already experienced a present 
situation. Retro toys, such as Rock 
’em Sock ’em Robots, were given 
life in the form of giant puppets 
held by participants.

Numerous 
musical 
groups 

were 
part 
of 
the 
puppet 

procession. These included the 
Detroit Marching Band, local 
funk band The Macpodz and 
University ensembles including 
Brazilian 
percussion 
band 

Vencedores and GROOVE.

FestiFools 
is 
organized 

annually 
by 
WonderFool 

Productions 
— 
a 
nonprofit 

organization which, in addition 
to hosting the art parade, hosts 
workshops 
for 
the 
general 

public and works to teach art in 
K-12 schools.

According to the WonderFool 

Productions website, FestiFools 
was inspired by cartapesta, paper-
mâché art of the Italian Carnevale 
di Viareggio.

Prior to the FestiFools parade, a 

similar procession of illuminated 
puppets and sculptures inhabited 
the same space on Main Street 
for FoolMoon, which took place 
Saturday night.

Among 
the 
numerous 

community 
members 
who 

contribute to FestiFools are 

University 
students 
in 
the 

Lloyd Hall Scholars Program, 
who create puppets through an 
LHSP-centric course called Art 
in Public Spaces.

Mark 
Tucker, 
FestiFools 

founder and creative director, 
is also LHSP’s art director and 
teaches the Art in Public Spaces 
course. Subsequently, students 
in the course helped create this 
year’s theme.

LSA 
freshman 
Michelle 

Belgrod, an LHSP student taking 
Art in Public Spaces, said she and 
her classmates took the somewhat 
“nostalgic” 
FestiFools 
theme 

to create pieces that reminded

CAMPUS LIFE

No protests 

organized after 

controversial choice 

to show film

By EMILY MIILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

After the University called off 

and then reinstated a showing of 
the film “American Sniper,” the 
screening drew about 100 people, 
but no organized protest.

During the last week, the 

University has received national 
attention for canceling a showing 
of the film “American Sniper” at 
UMix, the University’s weekly 
Friday evening event in the 
Michigan Union.

After students circulated a letter 

expressing concern about the film, 
saying the screening created an 
unsafe environment for Muslim 
and Middle Eastern and North 
African students on campus, the 

University temporarily canceled 
the showing, with the intention 
of showing the film at a later date 
followed by a panel discussion.

However, 
the 
University 

reversed course after a counter 
petition criticized the University’s 
decision, 
citing 
free 
speech 

concerns. The University provided 
a 
simultaneous 
screening 
of 

“Paddington” as an alternative 
movie option.

Moviegoers filled most of the 

Michigan Union’s Anderson Room 
for “American Sniper.” Shortly 
before the start of “Paddington,” 
the screening room was mostly 
empty.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said UMix may not 
have been the ideal place to screen 
“American Sniper,” but said the 
University 
needed 
to 
follow 

through with its original decision 
to screen the film.

“I think ‘American Sniper’ 

didn’t quite fit this venue and this 
event,” he said. “But, having said

Games, live performances 

and education booths covered 
Palmer Field on Saturday for 
the University’s annual Relay 

for Life event.

MRelay, 
the 
University’s 

chapter for Relay for Life that 
annually organizes the event to 
raise money for cancer research, 
hosted the 24-hour fundraising 
event for the 13th year.

LSA senior Dave Mullen-

Muhr, 
MRelay 
executive 

director, said approximately 
3,000 
people 
attended 

Saturday’s 
event, 
including 

representatives from dozens of 
student organizations, clubs, 
fraternities and sororities.

In 
total, 
Mullen-Muhr 

said teams raised more than 
$368,000 through fundraising 
campaigns and benefit concerts 
held 
throughout 
the 
year. 

Mullen-Muhr said this total 
makes MRelay the “highest

Fashion for Freedom 
holds mock fashion 
show to call attention 

to rape culture

By SARAH KHAN

Daily Staff Reporter

Fashion for Freedom — a 

student group that seeks to end a 
perceived rape culture on college 
campuses and reverse potentially 
degrading media portrayals of 
women, among other goals — 
staged a mock fashion show on 
the Diag on Friday to protest 
advertisements 
that 
arguably 

promote sexual violence and 
human trafficking.

LSA junior Savannah Dupin, a 

Fashion for Freedom co-founder,

human trafficking as a part of 
Sexual Assault Awareness Month.

Weinberg Symposium focuses on
relation between science, morality

CONNOR BADE/Daily

Molly J. Crockett, an associate professor at the University of Oxford, and John Mikhail, a professor at Georgetown University, speak at the Weinberg Symposium Friday at the Michigan League.

Speakers discuss 
cognitive psych 

and ethics 

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

The Marshall M. Weinberg 

Symposium — hosted Thurs-
day and Friday in the Michi-
gan League — focused on a key 
question: What does it mean 

to be moral?

This 
year’s 
symposium, 

titled “The Cognitive Science 
of Moral Minds,” was orga-
nized for the first year by the 
Weinberg Institute of Cogni-
tive Science. The University’s 
departments of Philosophy, 
Psychology, Linguistics and 
Molecular and Cellular Biolo-
gy previously hosted the sixth 
annual symposium.

The institute opened last 

April after the University 

received a $7.7 million dona-
tion 
by 
University 
alum 

Marshall M. Weinberg. The 
Weinberg Institute aims to 
promote an interdisciplinary 
approach to cognitive science 
research. It also houses the 
undergraduate cognitive sci-
ence major, which launched 
January 2014.

Thursday’s speaker, Joshua 

Greene, psychology profes-
sor at Harvard University, 
presented a lecture Thursday 

titled “Human Morali-
ty: Features and Bugs.”

Molly 
Crockett, 

associate 
professor 

of experimental psy-
chology at the Uni-
versity of Oxford, and 
John Mikhail, profes-
sor of law and philoso-
phy at Georgetown 
University, also deliv-
ered lectures during 
the symposium.

During 
his 
talk, 

Greene gave an over-
view of human moral-
ity based on findings 
from psychology, neu-
roscience and philoso-
phy. Greene defined 
morality as putting 
“us” before “me.”

“Morality is a suite 

of psychological fea-
tures that allow oth-

erwise selfish individuals to 
reap the benefits of coopera-
tion,” he said.

Greene also discussed the 

importance of cognitive sci-
ence research for studying 
morality. Cognitive science, 
he said, can change the way 
people ask questions about 
morality and help identify the 
underlying cognitive factors 
shaping moral standards.

Greene, who is also the 

director of the moral cog-
nition lab at Harvard, also 
applied his morality research 
to real life situations. Greene’s 
team of researchers found 
that not all people in the med-
ical field who deal with life-
and-death situations employ 
the same moral standards.

The team analyzed moral-

ity in two groups: medical 
doctors and people who work 
in public health. Greene said 
they found people in public 
health were, in comparison to 
medical doctors, more “utili-
tarian,” meaning that they 
value what produces the best 
outcome for the society.

“The idea is that if you are 

in public health, you are more 
concerned about the society,” 
he said. “Whereas if you are 
a doctor, you are concerned 
about the individual in front 
of you. It’s about your duty for 

that patient and as a doctor.”

Greene also commented on 

the “bugs,” or discrepancies, 
in morality identified by his 
team. For example, they found 
that people are more likely to 
help someone if the person 
who needed help was in close 
proximity — like a bleeding 
man on the side of the road as 
opposed to a child starving in 
another country. Greene said 
this moral discrepancy stems 
from evolution.

“From a biological perspec-

tive, it makes a lot of sense,” 
he said. “You didn’t evolve to 
be 
universally 
cooperative 

to everybody on Earth. You 
evolved for your tribe.”

Because a number of fac-

tors are involved in shaping 
one’s moral standards, he 
said it is difficult to come up 
with a general principle of 
how people should act. This 
idea suggests no theory can 
account for the complexity 
of the human mind. In spite 
of the difficulty, Greene said 
humans still need a general 
moral standard for how soci-
ety “ought to be.”

Rackham student Kevin 

Blackwell, who said he attend-
ed the symposium due to his 
interest in the topic, echoed 
Greene on the importance of 
human morality research.

United 2 Heal dinner fundraises 
to give Ghana medical supplies

Student group 
raises $2,700 

during fundraiser

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

A University student organiza-

tion raised $2,700 over the week-
end to help fund their partnership 

with physicians in Ghana.

United 2 Heal, which fundrais-

es to buy medical supplies for com-
munities in developing countries, 
hosted its eighth annual benefit 
dinner Saturday evening in Rack-
ham Auditorium. The event fea-
tured keynote speaker Dr. Thomas 
Crawford, an assistant professor 
of internal medicine.

Proceeds will go toward fos-

tering what Kinesiology senior 

Nathan Palaparthi, United 2 Heal 
president, calls the group’s biggest 
project: a partnership with physi-
cians in Ghana. The organization 
has sent shipments of supplies 
to underdeveloped areas in this 
region, and also works to sponsor 
students doing volunteer work.

Palaparthi said United 2 Heal’s 

overarching goal is to fight global 
health disparities by collecting 
excess medical supplies from hos-
pitals around Michigan and send-
ing them to places lacking these 
resources.

“Our mission is really twofold, 

in that first we’re trying to help 
individuals in other countries 
to obtain basic medical supplies 
and really equip resource-poor 
hospitals,” Palaparthi said. “But 
at the same time we’re doing so 
using medical supplies that are 
obtained from U.S. hospitals that 
would otherwise be disposed of.”

He added that United 2 Heal 

recently partnered with World 
Medical Relief — a Detroit-based 
organization that provides a 
variety of medical supplies for 
individuals lacking insurance, 
according to its website. United 2 
Heal members and other students 
on campus visit WMR’s Detroit 
warehouse weekly to help sort its 
stock of medical supplies.

University alum Joey Perosky, 

one of United 2 Heal’s founders 
and a research lab specialist in 
the Medical School, discussed 
the organization’s transition to a 
partnership in Ghana from their 
original recipients in Tanzania.

Perosky said the Tanzanian 

hospital did not give clear feed-
back on how they were actually 
using the medical supplies they 
received, and added that he was 
motivated to help after traveling 
to Ghana, where he observed a 
striking lack of medical supplies.

“While 
conducting 
clinical 

observations in the labor deliv-
ery ward at one of the hospitals, 
the lack of resources was read-
ily apparent, including adequately 
trained 
healthcare 
personnel, 

medical equipment and supplies,” 
he said.

Crawford, the keynote speaker 

at the event, related his work to 
United 2 Heal’s mission. He works 
on a project in collaboration with 
World Medical Relief called “My 
Heart Your Heart.” The project’s 
goal is to send pacemakers previ-
ously used by deceased patients 
to places where people could oth-
erwise not afford them.

“I think what has united us 

is the recognition that there are 
health disparities in the world, 
that it’s our moral responsibility 
to try to attend to them and that 
we cannot remain silent,” he said.

However, Crawford noted that 

Ghana’s Komfo Anokye Teaching 
Hospital does not have a perma-
nent cardiac catheterization lab 
or pacemaker implantation cen-
ter, making it difficult for patients 
to receive the heart treatment 
they need.

sexual activity to be verbal or oral, 
sober, and enthusiastic.”

However, 
language 
the 

University’s alternative definition 
of consent — as articulated in 
the Sexual Misconduct Policy 
— remains largely unchanged 
compared to a version updated on 
Jan. 17, 2015.

The top of the page begins 

by describing consent as “when 
someone agrees, gives permission, 
or says ‘yes’ to sexual activity with 
other persons.”

The page then proceeds to note 

that, “The University of Michigan 
Policy on Sexual Misconduct 
by Students defines consent 
as a clear and unambiguous 
agreement, 
expressed 
in 

mutually 
understandable 

words or actions, to engage in a 

particular activity.”

During his fireside chat on 

Wednesday, University President 
Mark Schlissel told students that 
the University is planning to role 
out changes to the University’s 
Student 
Sexual 
Misconduct 

Policy by the Fall 2015 semester. 
He said changes could potentially 
include the guidance students 
are given in regard to seeking 
counsel, among other issues.

The University most recently 

made changes to its Student 
Sexual Misconduct Policy in 2013 
in response to guidance from the 
U.S. Department of Education’s 
Office for Civil Rights in 2011. 
These alterations did not address 
the University’s definition of 
consent, but focused on amending 
the University’s responsibilities 
in 
the 
investigation 
process 

and the burden of proof applied 
in 
University 
disciplinary 

proceedings.

that, we made the commitment, 
we made that decision, and in 
the final analysis we needed to 
honor that decision that was 
made to show, and so tonight we 
have two movies.”

“American 
Sniper” 
is 
a 

2014 
film 
adaption 
of 
the 

autobiography of Chris Kyle, a 
sniper who served four tours 
in Iraq and is credited with the 
most kills in U.S. military history. 
While the movie has been 
critically acclaimed, it has also 
been critiqued for its depiction of 
Muslims and the war in Iraq.

“The reason why the film was 

disturbing to be played at UMix is 
because UMix is supposed to be 
fun and inclusive, and the movie 

‘American Sniper’ raised a lot of 
controversy from all sides of the 
spectrum,” wrote LSA sophomore 
Lamees Mekkaoui in the initial 
letter calling for the screening’s 
cancellation. “It’s clearly not 
something that could be fun and 
inclusive. It just doesn’t go with 
Build-A-Bear and inflatable laser 
tag, those things just don’t go 
with ‘American Sniper.’ ”

Before starting the film, a 

representative from the Center 
for Campus Involvement read a 
statement saying the University 
supported the right of the media 
to express viewpoints and would 
remove anyone who disrupted 
that right.

Though 
the 
University’s 

decisions related to the movie 
screenings 
has 
generated 

controversy on campus and in 
the national media, Friday’s 

UMix 
proceeded 
without 

protest or disruption. Late last 
week, several Muslim and Arab 
students reported. experiencing 
threats 
and 
racist 
remarks 

after many students in those 
communities advocated for the 
film screening’s cancellation.

Ann Arbor resident Mozhgan 

Savabieasfahani, a University 
alum, attempted to hold a 
discussion 
after 
the 
film, 

unaffiliated with the University. 
However, students showed a lack 
of interest and the discussion 
fell through.

When the University decided 

to show “American Sniper” at 
another location and time — 
before returning the film to the 
UMix schedule — the Center 
for Campus Involvement had 
promised a discussion forum 
following the screening.

Savabieasfahani said she came 

to the screening after hearing of 
the possibility of a student-led 
protest. However, a protest did 
not occur.

Business 
senior 
Lance 

Feigeles said he agreed with the 
University’s decision to follow 
through with the showing.

“I liked that they added the 

alternative movie for people who 
didn’t want to see it,” Feigeles said. 
“But I think the initial trying to get 
rid of it, I had a problem with that.”

Engineering sophomore Nick 

VerSchure also said he agreed 
with the University’s decision.

“The 
University 
is 
not 

condoning anything in this film 
as good or bad, they just want to 
show a feature film,” VerSchure 
said. “Personally, I’m here because 
I support the movie itself, and I 
support our troops.”

see the devastation that this brings 
all the time,” she said. “It is difficult 
to do this kind of work because you 
realize how many cultural norms 
are working against you.”

As part of the event, student 

models carried signs with sexually 
suggestive 
advertisements 
on 

them, and dressed up to mirror 
the women in these ads to bring 
attention to the level of media 
objectification. Others held signs 
that read: “Sexual objectification 
portrays 
women 
as 
sexual 

objects rather than individuals 
with 
their 
own 
experiences 

and personalities,” and “Sexual 
objectification 
often 
portrays 

women as submissive to men.”

The group asked local stores 

to take a pledge not to objectify 
women in their advertisements. 
Several Ann Arbor retailers signed 
the document, including The 
Getup Vintage, Pitaya, Bivouac, 
The M Den and Ragstock.

Lisa 
Weiss, 
the 
women’s 

fashion manager for Bivouac, said 
the march was constructive for 
dialogue, but could have caught 
the store’s patrons off guard.

“I believe in what they are 

doing and it is an interesting 
concept in order to shock and 
get attention (for the cause),” 
she said. “I didn’t have anything 
against them coming into the 
store, but I have no idea how my 
customers feel about it and the 
way it’s done could scare people.”

Attendees marched through a 

number of the participating stores 
along State Street, applauding 
them 
for 
their 
respectful 

advertising 
and 
protesting 

stores like American Apparel for 
sexualizing women’s bodies in 
their advertisements.

LSA freshman Rachel Beglin, 

Fashion for Freedom co-founder, 
said she is passionate about this 
issue and wants to continue raising 
awareness by keeping people 
informed through events like the 
Fashion for Freedom show on the 
Diag and the subsequent march 
down State Street.

“The models were dressed as 

the people in the ads to show that 
they are not 2-D and cannot be 
objectified,” Beglin said. “We were 
bringing them to life to show that 

they are real people.”

The group engaged in a moment 

of silence at American Apparel 
to show its disapproval of their 
ad campaigns, which members 
believe 
contribute 
to 
bigger 

societal issues, including rape and 
sexual violence toward women.

LSA freshman Natalie Drobny, 

who modeled as part of the show, 
stressed that the objectification of 
women in the media has been an 
ongoing issue for decades.

“I think that it is really important 

to raise awareness of stores that are 
still using ads that are derogatory 
toward women,” Drobny said. “We 
had ads from every single decade 
and it’s not getting any better — big 
chain stores are still involved. It 
sounded like a really cool thing to 
be involved in.”

them of childhood. As a result, she 
decided to create “a giant baby.”

“I had friend volunteers help 

animate the puppet,” Belgrod 
said. “What Mark (Tucker) says 
is that if you’re on a parade it’s a 
stage. Each puppet has a message, 
and so you’re supposed to animate 
it, make it come to life with the 
help of people. I was the base, so 
I kind of hid in the diaper of my 
baby. It was just a giant, 20-foot 
baby with his eyes closed.”

Belgrod added that her favorite 

part of both the class and the 
parade was interacting with 
fellow students as part of the 
artistic process.

“Usually when I create art, it’s 

very independent and unsocial,” 
she 
said. 
“Traveling 
to 
the 

studio, helping each other out 
and goofing off — the people and 
the energy that they brought to 
the class made everything just 
so fun. It was also really great to 
see how people would react to my 
own piece and those of my fellow 
classmates.”

Ross Huff, an Ann Arbor 

resident, said he enjoys FestiFools 

because it’s an opportunity for all 
members of the community to 
convene.

“Like, this is what we should 

be doing in our streets,” Huff 
said. “It’s the community getting 
together and bringing it out just 
for the sake of having a great time. 
It gets people out of the house and 
together. It gets you to remember 
who your neighbors are.”

“It’s one of our favorite annual 

traditions with the kids,” said 
Shannon Johnson, who brought 
her kids from Brighton, Mich. 
to the festival. “It’s just a great 
chance for them to see some fun, 
creative things.”

Lori 
Beth, 
another 
Ann 

Arbor resident, recently moved 
into town from Lansing. She 
attended the event with a small 
group of people, all of whom 
were also relatively new to Ann 
Arbor, as a way to familiarize 
herself with her new hometown. 
Her favorite puppet was a huge, 
paper-mâché puppet of arcade 
game character Pac-Man.

“I’ve never been to a parade 

of puppets before,” Beth said. “I 
really like the Pac-Man one. I’ve 
never been to an event where 
they’ve had art on display in this 
way. It’s just so much fun.”

patients and survivors to share 
their experiences fighting cancer.

LSA sophomore Mitchell Becker, 

a cancer survivor, discussed losing 
loved ones to cancer.

“I choose to relay to remember 

the family members that I have 
lost and because there’s hope,” he 
said. “I hope that someday nobody 
should ever have to lose another 
friend or family to cancer.”

In an interview, LSA sophomore 

Meredith Joseph, an MRelay 
recruitment specialist, said the 
event aims to be a cathartic outlet 
for survivors and those currently 
fighting the disease.

“My 
mother, 
who 
passed 

away due to cancer, deserves 
to be remembered each and 
every day,” Joseph said. “When 
I chose to relay, I found a group 

who is passionate about curing 
cancer. Relay for Life gave me the 
courage and strength to open up 
and relate to a giant community.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Lauren 

Gallagher added that the event 
was important even for those 
not directly affected by cancer. 
Gallagher attended the event 
with members of her pre-law 
fraternity, Kappa Alpha Pi.

“We 
fundraise 
mostly 
for 

Relay because it’s a fun event and 
it’s for a great cause,” Gallagher 
said. “It’s really cool to see so 
many different sororities and 
fraternities come together. Plus, 
it’s a great way to escape and also 
have fun.”

T

he University’s flip-flop deci-
sion last week to screen the 
Clint Eastwood film “Ameri-

can 
Sniper,” 
a 

biopic about Chris 
Kyle, 
the 
most 

lethal sniper in U.S. 
military 
history, 

at a UMix event as 
originally planned 
received scores of 
backlash from the 
University’s Mus-
lim and/or Middle 
Eastern and North 
African 
popula-

tions. These communities believed the 
film was ill-suited for an event meant 
to entertain, claiming that their safety 
on campus has become jeopardized by 
the University’s return to the decision 
to screen the film as entertainment 
instead of using said screening as an 
opportunity to discuss the film’s over-
arching themes and depictions.

Since the release of this film, myri-

ad writers have taken myriad stances 
both for and against Eastwood’s edi-
torial decisions in the telling of Kyle’s 
story. Some have come to view Kyle 
via his depictions as the typos of patri-
otic American bravery, a crusader of 
freedom and liberty, a defender of the 
defenseless from cruel, ill-intentioned 
purveyors of violence. Others view 
Kyle as a glorified murderer, a rac-
ist who dehumanized Iraqis and set 
them on equal footing with extrem-
ists. These two considerations of Kyle 
as both an individual and as a soldier 
underlie opinions about the film from 
two respective camps: the film is 
either a compelling dramatization of 
Kyle’s life or pro-war propaganda that 
misrepresents facts.

As a gay man, I fully understand the 

frustrations of Muslim and/or MENA 
communities in feeling misrepresent-
ed and stereotyped by media portray-
als of their communities; as a student 
of communications and media, howev-
er, I consider myself able to recognize 
the editorial decisions of a text as pro-
pagandistic and misleading. As such, I 
decided to do a close reading of the text 
in hope of understanding the heated 
controversy surrounding the film.

“American Sniper” undoubtedly 

provides a narrative of the Iraq War 
with only nominal stance in fact. 
Never are the political considerations 
of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 given 

due weight in the film, and the plot’s 
overly simplistic “Good vs. Evil” con-
flicts leave much to be desired if the 
text were to be read as historical. The 
ostensible weapons of mass destruc-
tion hoarded by the Iraqi regime are 
never discussed. Indeed, it could even 
be argued that editorial decisions 
attribute the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks 
as an overture to the American inva-
sion of Iraq. And the film’s aggressors 
— “The Butcher,” a sociopathic child 
torturer, and “Mustafa,” an enemy 
sniper and foil of sorts to Kyle — are 
depicted in stark, monochromatic 
contrast to the Kyle’s values, falsely 
depicting a war that was in actuality 
much more hued. These hyper-dra-
matized caricatures of insurgent vio-
lence are really the only Iraqis shown 
in the film. As such, it could be argued 
that this editorial decision leads to the 
categorization of Iraqis either as war-
mongering, inhuman perpetrators of 
very gruesome violence (e.g. drilling 
in a child’s head, or keeping a collec-
tion of dismembered Americans in the 
walk-in cooler of a restaurant), or as 
sympathizers to such people.

Were these aforementioned traits 

to stand alone in the film, I would 
wholeheartedly categorize it as pro-
pagandistic. The extremely narrow 
scope of the film’s narrative perspec-
tive, however, leads me to believe that 
these misrepresentations are used 
with artistic license for the purpose of 
conveying a message about the short-
comings of both a war-centered cul-
ture and Kyle as its product.

From childhood throughout his 

military training, Kyle is indoctrinat-
ed to the mantra of human classifica-
tion into three categories: the sheep, 
those who need protecting; the wolf, 
those perpetrators whose goal is to 
harm the sheep; and the sheep dog, 
those who serve to protect the flock. 
Kyle is told by his father from a young 
age that every man should strive for 
the latter classification. As told from 
Kyle’s narrow view, every depiction in 
the film is seen through the lens of this 
simplistic metaphor: the American 
people equal sheep; Kyle and the mili-
tary equal sheep dog; Iraqi insurgents 
equal wolves. The Iraqi people don’t 
fit into Kyle’s metaphor, so they’re left 
unconsidered, explaining the mechan-
ical nature with which Kyle can kill 
 

and dehumanize.

The film, by use of outside perspec-

tives which stand in contrast to Kyle’s, 
display the flaws of such a narrow way 
of thinking, however. Kyle becomes 
obsessed with defending the princi-
ples to which he’s been indoctrinated, 
serving four tours in Iraq, effectively 
abandoning his family in the process, 
so that he can hunt his direct adver-
saries. He becomes drunk off glory, 
especially after he’s been given the 
nickname “Legend.” When a comrade 
dies, a letter surfaces which poses the 
question “When does glory fade away, 
consume one completely?” Kyle views 
this as anti-war rhetoric, although in 
all actuality he is becoming consumed 
by glory himself, even to the point 
where he jeopardizes the lives of those 
in his unit by taking an unbelievable 
shot at one of his white rabbits with-
out acknowledging the dissent of the 
group. Many die in the process, and 
Kyle is almost left behind.

Once Kyle returns from war, he 

struggles with severe PTSD, but effec-
tively finds refuge in helping veter-
ans and being with his family. This 
could be considered a happy ending 
sans Kyle’s death, yet the film’s con-
clusion mirrors depictions of Kyle’s 
own upbringing with that of his son’s, 
showing the cyclical process of indoc-
trination. Eastwood’s choices in doing 
so show that Kyle’s narrow perspec-
tive is not necessarily an exception of 
American culture, but rather a norm; 
he is a product of a culture that glo-
rifies the idea of protectionism and 
interventionism without understand-
ing the culture’s naiveté. Kyle accepts 
this almost subconsciously, perpetrat-
ing these ideals and being affirmed by 
those around him along the way.

Thus, the familiarity of Kyle’s views 

is probably why so many from the 
ultra-patriotic camp absolutely love 
Kyle and the film. Furthermore, the 
narrow, one-sided depiction of the 
war via Kyle’s perspective is why so 
many hate the film, condemn it even 
as pro-war propaganda. But these con-
clusions are made without deeply ana-
lyzing the film’s depictions for what 
they are: a critique of the system from 
which Kyle came, and a use of his story 
and patriotic perspective as a vehicle 
of sorts through which to display the 
absurdity of an American system 
defined by protectionism.

Examining “American Sniper”

AUSTIN
DAVIS

A slew of recent news events 

— along with allegations of rape, 
destruction, racism and more across 
campuses nationwide — have cast a 
negative spotlight on Greek life. The 
light is so bright it outshines all of the 
positive contributions fraternities and 
sororities have made and the positive 
impact they have had on the commu-
nities around them. It’s time to shut 
down that spotlight. It’s time to lift the 
shadow and remind us the true reason 
people join the Greek system: to make 
a difference and to be part of a commu-
nity. There are many of us who joined 
a sorority or fraternity to be a part of 
something, to give back and to experi-
ence college life together. What once 
began as groups aspiring for unity, 
philanthropy and a familial-like bond, 
has grown to have a negative conno-
tation due to isolated issues that get 
out of hand. It is time take a stand and 
start speaking up about bad behavior 
before it gets worse. Let’s take a stand. 
Let’s speak up.

In light of recent events involving 

our sorority and many other houses in 
the Greek community here at the Uni-
versity, as well as on campuses nation-
wide, the sisters of Sigma Delta Tau 
are launching a campus-wide initiative 
called “Speak Up! Michigan.” This ini-
tiative is intended to inspire students 
to have the courage to speak out in 
the face of a potentially dangerous 
situation and mitigate the many issues 
caused by a lack of bystander aware-
ness. Through this campaign, SDT is 
hoping to forge partnerships with stu-
dent groups and the University to raise 
awareness of bystander intervention 

and to properly educate students on 
how to react to threatening situations.

While the campaign is only in its 

startup phase, the feedback has been 
astoundingly positive. Campus and 
student leaders alike have come togeth-
er to back the campaign and speak out 
about this important issue. While we 
all would like to say we would know 
how to react when our peers are act-
ing inappropriately and putting us at 
risk, we have never taken the opportu-
nity to equip ourselves with the proper 
tools to take action during an actual 
situation. Through a series of initia-
tives, Speak Up! hopes to foster open 
conversation between groups and indi-
viduals alike about the negative conse-
quences of being a bystander. Change 
never occurs unless you step up and 
make it — it starts with a simple stride 
in the right direction.

To launch this effort, we invited 

producer-turned-campus 
activist 

Mike Dilbeck to campus. Dilbeck will 
work to empower us with “Coura-
geous Leadership,” and show us how 
to make a difference and intervene in 
inappropriate situations. He believes 
that seizing an opportunity to act can 
dramatically change the campus com-
munity and allow students to make a 
difference. We look forward to work-
ing with Dilbeck to gain the tools, 
resources and confidence to make this 
happen and to help others Speak Up!

While the semester is coming to a 

close, the sisters of Sigma Delta Tau 
and the sorority’s executive board plan 
to work tirelessly over the summer to 
plan events to run in the fall before 
formal recruitment begins. The goal 

is to educate members of Greek life, 
as well as other student-run organi-
zations, such as Central Student Gov-
ernment, club sports and others, on 
how they can appropriately respond 
to issues that may arise during group 
functions. Being prepared is your best 
line of defense, and that is the message 
that Speak Up! seeks to get across.

With all the crises occurring in the 

world right now, it has been incredible 
to be able to see an issue bring so many 
differing minds together. It’s very rare 
to find a cause we, as a community at 
large, can get behind — which is where 
the importance of the Speak Up! cam-
paign truly stems from. Bystander 
intervention is a prominent issue 
across college campuses, rarely getting 
the amount of attention it deserves. It’s 
a uniquely gender and politically neu-
tral problem which together we have 
the ability to solve, and that’s what 
makes Speak Up! so special.

No matter who you are, what you 

believe or what issues you stand for, 
you’ll undoubtedly find yourself a 
bystander in a situation. Taking the 
initiative and becoming proactive 
is the first step of many to mitigat-
ing the situation before it gets out of 
hand. So stand with us and we will 
stand with you to Speak Up! and 
make a difference. For more infor-
mation, visit www.SpeakUpMichi-
gan.com. Mike Dilbeck will discuss 
“The Revolution of Courageous 
Leadership” at 8 p.m. on Monday, 
April 13 at the Michigan Union.

One of the core values that guides the Sexual 

Assault and Prevention Awareness Center’s 
work is respect. And for SAPAC, consent is 
respect. As we work toward a world free of sex-
ual assault, intimate partner violence, stalking 
and sexual harassment, we promote equality 
and respect for all members of our community 
through our commitment to primary preven-
tion. Our primary prevention approach is cen-
tered on our vision and hope for a future where, 
as a community, we expect consent for sexual 
activity to be verbal, sober and enthusiastic. 
This vision is our aspiration, and it exceeds 
the definition of consent in the Student Sexual 
 

Misconduct Policy.

In the Relationship Remix first-year work-

shop, in the online training, Community 
Matters, and in the presentations delivered 
by SAPAC volunteers, we teach the institu-
tional definition of consent and we also share 
our aspirational goal for all consent to be ver-
bal, sober and enthusiastic. We believe this is 
the very best way to ensure that you are treat-

ing another person with respect and that you 
have their consent to engage in the desired 
 

sexual activity.

It is an encouraging sign of a shift in our 

campus cultural values that many students 
desire for affirmative, verbal consent to be 
included in the institution’s consent defini-
tion, and even more importantly, be fully 
integrated into our behaviors and beliefs as 
the expected, common practice of students 
when they have sex. As a culture, though, we 
are not there yet and SAPAC makes this dis-
tinction in our educational efforts. In order 
to address the issue raised by the Daily’s 
Editorial Board, SAPAC staff have carefully 
reviewed our website materials and revised 
the information provided on consent to make 
this distinction clearer. You can read the 
updated website language at http://sapac.

How SAPAC defines consent

FROM THE DAILY

Improve laptop equity

The University should increase access to laptops for students
W

ith education now firmly planted in the information 
age, laptops are becoming an increasingly crucial tool 
for students on campus. For those who cannot afford a 

laptop, there are short-term laptop loan programs available, which 
can be extended long-term if the LSA student or faculty member 
has the required paperwork. According to a recent article in The 
Michigan Daily, the University is working to improve the current 
program through a pilot laptop loan program that will launch in 
Fall 2015, allowing students who need the most financial assistance 
to borrow a laptop for the duration of their time at the University. 
However, for this program to be successful, this program needs to 
expand its eligibility and be more transparent to students.

There are significant disadvantages to not 

owning a laptop on campus. First, the number of 
available desktops for students to use is limited 
largely to libraries and residence halls — which 
for some students may not be conducive work 
environments. This limits the flexibility in work 
hours. For example, a student that must go to the 
library for computer use may not feel comfortable 
going there late at night. Furthermore, not being 
able to keep up with taking notes during a fast-
paced lecture is more difficult, if not impossible, 
for a student without access to a laptop. Trying to 
work on group projects could prove challenging 
without access to a laptop, mandating the group 
to convene in places with desktops or for an 
individual to be forced to constantly look at a 
laptop over someone else’s shoulder.

There are ways the University is attempting 

to help students who need them but for a short 
period of time. According to the Instructional 
Support Services Media Center Loan at the 
University, a student can borrow a laptop for 
24 hours. If no one else is waiting for it, the 
student can renew it for another 24 hours. It 
is possible to repeatedly check out computers 
to extend the loan or override the 24-hour 
rule with correct paperwork showing that 
a student needs it for a project or a class, but 
there is no direct way to acquire a laptop for a 
long period of time. At the Media Center Loan 
in the Modern Languages Building, there are 
six PCs and six MacBooks available in total for 
loan. As of April 11, there were two MacBooks 
and four PCs available. There is also a loan 
center in Mason Hall, where there are seven 
PCs available and 10 MacBooks available. 

On April 11, all PCs and six Macbooks 
 

were available.

While effective for short-term solutions, 

this program is lacking for students who 
can’t afford a laptop and need one. The 
new pilot program the University wants to 
implement in Fall 2015 would be an effective 
way to solve this problem. Currently, Stanford 
University has a program which students on 
financial aid can receive compensation for 
certain purchases in relation to technology 
and computers. The University should follow 
this model; it provides students the help they 
need while also allowing for flexibility in the 
computers they decide to purchase. In addition 
to a program for students on financial aid, as 
a second component, the University should 
work toward a rental program that is cheap 
and accessible to all students — regardless of 
socioeconomic status.

The University should work toward more 

transparency in these old and new programs, 
by sending e-mails at the beginning of each 
semester, for example, that remind students 
about these programs and what they offer. And 
when the University begins the new Fall 2015 
laptop loan program, the University should 
include information about it in financial 
 

aid packages.

Laptops may not have been a necessity in 

the past, but today, they are essential to being a 
successful college student. In order to level the 
playing field for all students, it is crucial that 
computers are accessible to all and that there 
are measures to ensure that students who need 
financial assistance to purchase them receive it.

SIGMA DELTA TAU | VIEWPOINT

Michigan, it’s our time to Speak Up!

WILL ROYSTER | VIEWPOINT

Running for CSG president has certainly 

been one of the most rewarding experiences 
of my time at the University. This campaign 
challenged me to go beyond my realm of lead-
ership and community. The process intro-
duced me to so many different individuals 
and organizations, each with a unique voice 
and cause. The dialogues we held helped me 
understand what campus truly needs, and I 
sincerely thank all of those who believed in 
the vision that The Team, Matt Fidel and I 
created together.

Alas, the margin of victory was five votes. 

Cooper and Steven worked tirelessly during 
their campaign and I truly congratulate them. 
It was a privilege to converse on so many differ-
ent topics, which often challenged me to think 
critically about our campus. I am confident that 
their work ethic and vision will be a driving 
force for the University. I am looking forward 
to watching you gentlemen move big rocks.

In spite of losing the CSG election, in reflec-

tion, I couldn’t be happier with the journey 
overall. The Team was built on values, integ-
rity and a vision. 4,036 people shared that 
vision. We were able to mobilize communities 
and inspire others. We had the opportunity 
to learn from each other and building lasting 
and meaningful relationships. I cherish each 
moment of this campaign because the expe-
rience shared with each and every person 
 

is invaluable.

Given the amount of support in our vision, 

I still hold a desire and responsibility to help 
create change on this campus. Looking onward 
and upward, I plan to continue to promote 
cross-campus collaboration by working close-
ly with many student organizations through 
#StandByBlue. #StandByBlue has been a pow-
erful agent for highlighting student organiza-
tions and diversity on campus. In addition, I 
plan to expand the Michigan Institute for the 
Improvement of African American Represen-
tation program, which brought 46 underrep-

Onward and upward

resented communities in Kalamazoo 
to the University for a three-day resi-
dential 
experience. 
Giving 
that 

opportunity to students has certainly 
been my greatest accomplishment 
and with the help of the other found-
ers, I look forward to extending that 
opportunity to more students. 

Losing by five votes has taught me 

that every single voice on this cam-
pus matters. It has shown me that 
each and every narrative and story 
contributes to this great institu-
tion. As a result, I plan to continue 
to share my voice through poetry 
to relate and connect with students 
across campus. Together, each of 
our voices creates one unified voice, 

which represents the greatest uni-
versity in the world. As the leaders 
and the best, it is on us to listen to 
each voice, speak out, take action 
and together, create the campus that 
we want to see.

Harriet is made for 
your summer playlist

By DANIEL SAFFRON

For The Daily

As the weather here in Ann 

Arbor changes from rosy-nosed 
cold and gonadally harsh to sweat-
er shedding, sunglass prompting 
and frisbee conducive, we all begin 
to get frantic over what tunes 
are going to usher in that oh-so 
cherished oh-so missed summer 
lovin’. There’s nowhere better to 
look than perpetually summer-
suspended Los Angeles, where 
up-and-coming 
band 
Harriet 

promises us some of those syrupy 
sweet summer feels with a recent 
EP that makes us crave beaches, 
sun and aloe vera.

Harriet’s members are young 

– Alex Casnoff, the singer and for-
mer member of bands Dawes and 
PAPA, is 27 and Henry Kwapis, the 
drummer, is only 21. However their 
sound is on the verge of maturity. 
The band has rock band set up, but 
is leaps and bounds from your tra-
ditional rock sound. Distant from 
your typical anything, Harriet EP 
is a cattle prod to the backside of 
palatable pop and radio-approved 
anthems. The band’s aura isn’t 
immediately placeable; Kwapis 
told me that the band was never a 
“genre project,” and Casnoff told 
me that he “(doesn’t) like when you 
can immediately place your finger 
on what (a song) is.” What is spe-
cial about Harriet is that they’ve 
managed to earnestly represent 
their unique tastes, sounds and 
self-concept in an industry that 
emphasizes variations on hack-
neyed cookie-cutter archetypes.

Harriet EP, only four tracks in 

length, goes many different plac-
es and capitalizes on an eclectic 
soundscape. “Irish Margaritas,” 
the first track, is fun and dance-
able, but under the ebullient 
synths, excited drums, chirpy 
guitar licks and pinball bass lines 
hides the tale of the narrator’s 
Gaelic-Mexican-beverage-influ-
enced struggle with lost romance; 
“One more drink and I might show 
up at your doorstep knowing fully 
well the probability that he’s inside 
/ One more drink and I might tap 
you on the shoulder tell you ‘baby 
though it’s over and I know that 

that’s a lie,” Casnoff sings. It’s the 
kind of song that starts in-car aux 
cord arguments with me and my 
mother – not for everyone – but 
its concurrent sarcastic and heart 
wrenching qualities are something 
that everyone can appreciate.

“Up Against It” and “Burbank,” 

the second and third tracks, are 
different from “Irish Margaritas,” 
but are similar to each other. Both 
are reverberant, ruminative and 
emotionally viscous. These two 
songs cast the band’s songwriting 
prowess in a felicitous spotlight. 
At once sad and romantic, the 
album’s middle tracks hypnotize 
with a rose-pedals-and-red-wine 
seduction – tracks suited both for 
make outs and introspection on an 
open highway. The last track “Ten 
Steps” is somewhere between 
“Irish Margaritas” and “Burbank.” 
It’s exciting and diligently senti-
mental, with some of the EP’s most 
powerful lyrics.

As a whole, the lyrics on the 

EP are artful and resplendent, but 
evocatively casual, pupil-dilating 
and shocking at times. In “Ten 
Steps,” Casnoff sings, “If you’ve 
been killed again / My body is still 
physical when I’m asleep / I hear 
you breathe it in / I am detective 
you are my crime scene,” which 
has the conflicting sentimental-
ity of a teddy bear wearing latex 
gloves. In “Burbank,” he sings “We 
were in love / The cigarette / That 
held her lips / The pussy wet,” in 
a way that isn’t the slightest bit 
naïve or derogatory – your grand-
ma would ask for a Kleenex if she 

heard it. Casnoff described his 
songs as “first person monologues 
from characters that aren’t always 
(him) … all who deal with similar 
kinds of things, maybe in different 
ways … (like) anxiety and not being 
able to figure shit out.” While being 
a monologue, each track feels like 
an 
intimate 
beer-and-barstool 

conversation with Alex.

The last vital component to 

the Harriet admixture is the 
eyebrow skewing music videos. 
“Irish Margaritas” ’s video cen-
ters around a weird plastic lime 
literally placed on a pedestal and 
surrounded by TIKI torches and 
sparklers. In “Burbank,” a porn-
star-moustached, Kenny-G-haired 
man assumes Casnoff’s role as the 
band’s singer, while Casnoff mar-
ries a stripper in front of a vending 
machine. The videos, which Cas-
noff likens to short movies, provide 
further insight into each track’s 
elusive soliloquist.

I’ve followed Harriet since its 

inception three years ago. Now 
signed with Harvest Records, 
owned by Capitol, the band has 
seen some radical changes over 
the years with a generally positive 
trend. Harriet EP is a precursor to 
the band’s full album, which the 
members and I both hope to see out 
this summer. If you’re a fan of well-
written, inventive music or you sim-
ply like to be that person who knows 
a chill band that your friends don’t, 
Harriet deserves a listen. I look for-
ward to their full album release and 
will be keeping Harriet on my radar; 
I suggest you do this same.

Obioma to read 
debut at Literati 

Nigerian novelist 
will present first 

novel Tuesday 

By COSMO PAPPAS

Daily Arts Writers

Sitting at the corner of Division 

St. and Washington St., Literati 
Bookstore has taken great effort 
to provide the 
infrastructure 
for a thriving 
literary culture 
in Ann Arbor. 
This 
Tuesday, 

they will wel-
come debut nov-
elist 
Chigozie 

Obioma through 
their “Fiction at 
Literati” series, 
the 
comple-

ment to their 
“Poetry at Literati” series. A Helen 
Zell Fellow of Creative Writing, 
Obioma was born in Nigeria, stud-
ied in Cyprus and lived in Tur-
key. Obioma will give a reading 
to commemorate his first novel, 
“The Fishermen,” to be released 
through Little, Brown and Com-
pany the same day.

“I wanted to write this story, 

I was inspired to write this story 
about a close-knit family,” Obio-
ma said in an interview with 
The Michigan Daily. “What is 
it that can come between them 
and 
bring 
destruction 
and 

destroy the unity of the family? 
And not just a family, but any 
entity at all.”

Obioma’s novel is, as Helon 

Habila of The Guardian describes 
in his review of the book, “a Bil-
dungsroman,” a coming-of-age 
story. The four brothers in the 
novel must navigate their lives 
after their father departs for a job 
transfer. They pick up fishing as 
they lose their sense of routine in 
the absence of their father’s dis-
ciplinary guidance. But shortly 
after being “discovered by their 
neighbor who tells their moth-
er,” “they meet the local oddball, 
Abulu, who has the power of 
prophecy, and who predicts that 
Ikenna, the oldest, will be killed 
by one of his brothers: a fisher-
man,” Habila says. “It is from this 
simple, almost mythological con-
ceit that Chigozie Obioma’s debut 
novel grows, gaining complexity 
and power as it rises to its heart-
breaking climax.”

“The Fishermen” has been 

received positively for the ways 
that it balances many different 
projects. Describing the book as 
one that works with elements of 
“the traditional English novel form 
with the oral storytelling tradi-
tion” against an Aristotelian tragic 
arc, Habila celebrates the parallel 
dramas of Obioma’s book.

Obioma described his inter-

est in “parallel universes” and the 
way that “human beings (exist) at 
the same time as spirits and these 
ethereal creatures.”

Habila reads Obioma’s novel 

both as a Bildungsroman and 
as a sort of allegory of the post-
independence history of Nigeria. 
Obioma seeks out this “both-and” 
play of narrative in both form 
and content, citing influences as 
diverse as Greek myth and epic, 
Arundhati Roy, Thomas Hardy, 
William 
Shakespeare, 
Gabriel 

Garcia Marquez, Günter Grass 
and Chinua Achebe. Obioma looks 
to Achebe (1930-2013), the late 
preeminent Nigerian writer and 
one of the most significant and 
widely read writers from Africa, 
as a writer from whom he learns 
about Igbo (a major ethnic group 
of Nigeria) traditions, philoso-
phies and history.

“What I have always been 

afraid of is people reading this 
book because they feel it is exotic 
to them, and content trumping 
form, you know, the beauty of 
writing,” Obioma said. “Largely, 
even in the translated form, in 
German, one thing everyone has 
unanimously agreed on is the 
beauty of the prose, and that is 
the aesthetics, the art of the book, 
which gives me joy because now 
somebody cannot say, ‘Oh, I am 
reading this one to understand 
Africa because I want to.’ You 
know, this is not why we read, that 
is not why I read.”

Join Obioma this Tuesday in the 

Espresso Bar on the second floor of 
Literati to hear selections from his 
novel and his thoughts on his well-
received, successful debut.

‘Daredevil’ dark, edgy

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Wrtier

The success Marvel has had 

in recent years is almost unprec-
edented. With several blockbuster 
franchises, 
a 

flourishing cin-
ematic universe 
and a couple TV 
shows under its 
belt, the com-
pany has proven 
itself to be a 
dominant force. 
Now it enters 
the streaming game with Netflix’s 
newest series, “Daredevil.”

The show stars Charlie Cox 

(“Boardwalk Empire”) as Matt 
Murdock, a blind lawyer turned 
titular vigilante. “Daredevil” is 
probably the darkest product 
Marvel has produced to date. In 
its first four episodes, “Daredevil” 
questions the limits Murdock can 
go to as a vigilante and where the 
line is drawn between justice and 
vengeance.

Set in Hell’s Kitchen, New York 

City, “Daredevil” casts its city 
with little light. Shadows cover 
even the open areas in darkness as 
neon, harsh yellow and sterile blue 
lights evoke a neo-noir stylistic feel 
while capturing a comic book aes-
thetic. Trying to bring light to the 
city are Murdock and his law part-
ner Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson, 
“Mockingjay: Part 1”), who have 
just started their own practice, 
with their first client being the 
framed Karen Page (Deborah Ann 
Woll, “True Blood”). The three 
form a central trio of do-gooders. 
Foggy is comic relief but is com-
petent in his own right next to 
the quiet Murdock. While Karen 
serves as little more than a damsel-
in-distress in the first episode, the 
show quickly allows her to develop 
beyond her initial trauma as she 
starts investigating United Allied 
Construction – the company that 
tried to frame her after she found 
something she shouldn’t have.

Murdock is also given a confi-

dante, Claire (Rosario Dawson, 
“Sin City”), a nurse who patches 
him up after finding him laying 
wounded in a dumpster during the 
second episode. The relationship is 
the most challenging for Murdock. 
Claire has seen the good Murdock 
has performed in the form of the 
broken criminal victims of Dare-
devil, yet she openly questions the 
measures he takes. Simultaneously 
a foil and confidante, Claire pro-
vides needed interaction for Mur-
dock in costume, humanizing his 

vigilante side, but challenging his 
extreme measures.

Murdock is a tortured char-

acter beneath his quiet visage. 
Blinded at a young age, Murdock 
learns from his boxer dad, Jack 
(John Patrick Hayden, “Blue 
Bloods”) that, “It ain’t how you 
hit the mat, it’s how you get up.” 
There’s a pride passed down from 
father to son in fighting for who 
you are, a strength and fatal flaw 
that claims the elder Murdock’s 
life when he refuses to take a dive 
during a boxing match.

The same goes for Matt Mur-

dock years later. As Daredevil, 
Murdock serves as an unstoppa-
ble presence against the criminals 
that plague his city. This trans-
lates into bone crushing, kinetic 
fight scenes that can be placed 
among the best on any TV show. 
Punches land hard, knives cut 
deep and no one goes down easy 
in “Daredevil.” This is no more 
apparent than in episode two’s 
climactic battle that harkens back 
to Park Chan-wook’s “Oldboy.” 
Shot in nearly one take, a wound-
ed Murdock enters a hallway 
occupied by two roomfuls of Rus-
sian mobsters. At the end of the 
hallway is a door, and behind that 
door is a kidnapped boy. The fight 
is an exhausting brawl that tests 
the young superhero’s endurance. 
He leans against a wall, capturing 
a quick breather, before reenter-
ing the fray of stumbling combat-
ants. It’s the standout moment 
early in the series that combines 
a fantastic physical performance 
by Cox, expert direction by Phil 
Abraham (“Mad Men”), phenom-
enal stunt work by coordinator 
Philip J. Silvera (“A Walk Among 
the Tombstones”) and Cox’s dou-
ble Chris Brewster (“Thor: the 
Dark World”).

Murdock, though, faces his 

greatest foe, Wilson Fisk, a.k.a 
Kingpin 
(Vincent 
D’Onofrio, 

“Full Metal Jacket”). The first 
three episodes are spent hyp-
ing the character up, with one 
character impaling himself on a 
spike instead of facing the conse-
quences of just saying his name. 
It’s ironic then that the first time 
the character is fully explored in 
episode four, “In the Blood,” he 
is seen at his most uncomfort-
able, on a date with an art dealer 
(Ayelet Zurer, “Man of Steel”). In 
this setting, he is quiet and awk-
ward, increasing the suspense 
about when his true colors will 
show. There’s a dread about when 
this character will erupt from his 
initially quiet disposition, and 

when he does D’Onofrio doesn’t 
disappoint.

“Daredevil” is a dark medita-

tion on the lengths a superhero 
can go before they cross the line 
physically and mentally. With 
strong performance and direction 
in its early episodes, this is defi-
nitely a worthy tonal shift in the 
Marvel universe.

Louie C.K.’s FX 
series is unlike 

anything else on TV

By ALEX INTNER 

Daily Arts Writer

There’s 
something 
amazing 

about “Louie.” From the moment it 
debuted in 2010, it separated itself 
from 
every-

thing else on 
television. The 
series 
oper-

ates on a dis-
mal budget as a 
way to make it 
financially via-
ble for FX and 
give its creator, 
writer, director, 
star and edi-
tor Louis C.K. 
(“Lucky Louie”) the ability to work 
without 
network 
interference. 

This leads to a show that is about 
whatever the comedian desires. 
Sometimes, the stories are hys-
terically funny (like the Season 2 
episode “Pregnant”). Other times, 
the series tells thought-provoking 
stories (like last season’s “Into 
the Woods” and “So Did the Fat 
Lady”). Four episodes into the fifth 
season, nothing’s changed for the 
show. It continues to mix up its 
tone in a way that creates a fasci-
nating series.

As usual, “Louie” follows the life 

of a fictional version of Louis C.K. 
(referred to as Louie). He performs 
stand-up, dates Pamela (Pamela 
Adlon, who played his wife on 
“Lucky Louie”) and raises his two 
daughters. Louie’s various roles 
are built into the first four episodes 
of the new season, which include 
Louie attending a potluck, going 
to a cooking store, running into his 

sister’s ex-boyfriend and spending 
some time with his brother.

Within those stories, “Louie” 

shows exactly how funny it can be, 
and how it can tackle some more 
serious topics as well. The first 
episode, “Potluck,” falls under one 
of the funnier ones in the group. 
Louie’s scene where he has sex 
with a surrogate (played by Uni-
versity alum Celia Keenan-Bolger, 
a Broadway veteran) is incredibly 
uncomfortable, but C.K., per usual, 
finds humor in that discomfort. 
However, the season’s third episode 
features two of the show’s most 
intriguing stories. In the cold open, 
Louie talks to a millennial, and the 
result is a scene that is both hysteri-
cal and makes Louie look sad in a 
new way. The second half of the 
episode has Louie running into his 
sister’s ex, played by Michael Rap-
paport (“Justified”), an unlikeable 
man. Rappaport and C.K. are bril-
liant in creating their relationship, 
in a turn that could easily earn Rap-
paport an Emmy nomination for 
Guest Actor in a Comedy.

However, “Louie” ’s storytelling 

doesn’t just shine in the stories-of-
the-week. It also does a wonder-
ful job of telling the ongoing story 
of Louie and Pamela’s relation-

ship. Though the show did multi-
part episodes in the past, it didn’t 
really approach serialized stories 
until last season, which ended 
with a three-parter about Louie’s 
unfolding relationship with his ex-
girlfriend Pamela, and two of the 
four episodes continue that story-
line. Adlon and C.K. have fantas-
tic chemistry, and C.K. uses that 
to construct some brilliant jokes 
(look out for a scene in a movie 
theater). However, it’s the dramat-
ic aspect of this arc that is more 
notable. In a way, these stories are 
sad in the manner in which they 
play out, but on the other hand, 
they show two people who genu-
inely have feelings for each other, 
which makes the end of the fourth 
episode that much more powerful.

There’s 
nothing 
else 
that 

matches “Louie” ’s perfect bal-
ance of tones on television. While 
a few other shows have tried to 
copy the model (most notably 
“Maron” at IFC), none have come 
close to matching the pitch-perfect 
mix that makes the series special. 
Hopefully the low premiere rat-
ings are still high enough for FX 
to continue to support C.K.’s vision 
because what he’s turning out is 
truly great.

Coachella: The best 
and worst of times

By RACHEL KERR

Daily Arts Wrtier

This weekend, my Instagram 

filled with photos of friends – 
you know those friends you used 
to get drunk with in high school 
but, like, not actually hang out 
with? – as they ran through the 
California desert wearing flow-
er head bands and flash-tats. 
Because they’re at Coachella. 
And I’m not. For the first time 
in three years. If I sound bitter, 
it’s because I am. Still, those 
days in the Indio heat hold some 
of my fondest memories: my 
best times and my worst times, 
filled with some wise decisions 
and some foolish ones.

It was the best of times, it was 

the worst of times. Best when 
you’re approaching the scorch-
ing desert, your car equally 
packed with sticky limbs and 
stuffed luggage and some Drake 
song blaring through the speak-
ers, worst when you reach the 
sprawling polo field a little 
after midnight and have to wait 
hours in a line of cars rang-
ing from Mercedes to Mazdas, 
Camaros to Camrys, before 
you can unload; best when 

those hours lead to the forma-
tion of unconventional friend-
ships, worst when some of those 
new friends wear “GYM, TAN, 
LAX” T-shirts and eat all your 
flavor-blasted 
goldfish; 
best 

when your feet first touch the 
field’s floor, worst when your 
feet get run over moments after 
they first touch that dead grass 
(though you miraculously don’t 
break any toes); best when you 
cry watching Jeff Mangum, 
worst when your friends make 
you stand through a Skrillex 
set; best when you’re laugh-
ing as you hold a heavy-duty 
garbage bag for your friend to 
vomit in, worst when that same 
friend has to hold your hair 
back as you throw up publicly 
in an aluminum trash can; best 
when you watch A$AP Rocky 
perform before you even know 
who he is, worst when a naked 
woman starts dancing on you in 
the crowd; best when you watch 
the sun kiss the desert moun-
tains around 7:00 p.m, tinting 
the sky with a pale pink and 
purple, worst when you feel the 
sun rise at 6:00 a.m and with 
it, the temperature approaches 
100 degrees.

It was the age of wisdom, it 

was the age of foolishness. Wise 
to finally begin setting up your 
campsite at 3:00 a.m, fool-
ish when your lack of camping 
experience causes you to break 
the tent; wise to bring an air 
mattress for the tent, foolish to 
accidentally poke a hole in said 
mattress; wise to befriend your 
car-camping next-door neigh-
bors who offer you absinthe, 
foolish to willingly drink it; 
wise to buy a few disposable 
cameras, foolish to think you’ll 
want to carry them around all 
day; wise to bring a reusable 
water bottle, foolish to forget 
to apply sunscreen to your fair, 
freckled skin; wise to fill your 
friend’s whole camelback with 
vodka, foolish to drink it all 
before Shlomo’s afternoon set; 
wise to eat a piece of Spicy Pie 
pizza, foolish to eat four pieces 
of Spicy Pie pizza; wise to take 
some time off in the shade, 
foolish to fall asleep and miss 
most of Kurt Vile’s show. Wise 
to try and forget the festival is 
only three days, foolish to think 
you’ll be able to go again after 
you become a college student 
and move to Michigan.

A little after 3 p.m. Friday, Sandy Johnson saw 

her daughter take a punch to the face for the first 
time ever. A few minutes later, she watched her 
hoist a national championship belt.

Kate Johnson earned her second national boxing 

title when she won the 119-pound division of the 
USIBA College Boxing Championships. Before 
losing Saturday in the Golden Gloves tournament, 

she was undefeated at 9-0. Just a few years ago, her 
parents would have never seen this coming.

“She was usually pretty quiet until she got mad 

or riled up,” Ed Johnson said. “But she’ll hit her 
head on a brick wall just to get something done or 
prove a point.”

Now a senior, Johnson grew up in Farmington 

Hills, Michigan and was a swimmer at Divine Child 
High School in Dearborn. She liked to exercise, 
and joined the Michigan boxing club at FestiFall 
because she thought it might be an interesting way 
to stay in shape.

At first, she just wanted to punch the bag.
But as she dove deeper into the sport and spent 

more time honing her skills, the competitive itch 
took over. It can be difficult to schedule actual 
opponents

Women win national 

championship, men finish 
second inside IM Building

The biggest athletic event in Ann Arbor this 

weekend didn’t take place at any of the sparkling, 
million-dollar Division I athletics facilities known 
nationwide.

While the new and polished fields, tracks and 

arenas baked in the early-spring sun, thousands 
of fans flocked to the sweaty, echoing gymnasium 
of the century-old Intramural Sports Building for 

the USIBA National Championships. It was, by all 
accounts, a knockout event.

“We got a lot of compliments about how the 

tournament was run, from the officials, coaches, to 
the teams and fighters that came from all over the 
country,” said Michigan coach Tony Sensoli. “They 
felt we were very organized and things ran really 
smoothly.”

With the backing of a home crowd, Michigan 

earned five individual national championships to 
claim its first-ever women’s team title. Though it 
came up short in repeating as national champion in 
the men’s group, taking second instead, the biggest 
story of the weekend was the event itself.

Drawing 150 boxers from over 30 teams and 

attended by thousands of screaming fans, the event 
showed

‘M’ misses three-peat

Wolverines finish 

fourth behind 

Oklahoma, Penn 
State, Stanford

By CAROLYN KODIS

Daily Sports Writer

The third time wasn’t the 

charm for the Michigan men’s 
gymnastics team.

Friday 
night, 
the second-

ranked 
Wolverines 
aimed 

for a three-peat as national 
champions, but came up short, 
landing in fourth place out of 
six teams. Michigan’s final tally 
was 437.650, behind eventual 
champion Oklahoma, Penn State 
and Stanford.

“Obviously I’m disappointed 

because we didn’t perform up to 
our capabilities,” said Michigan 
coach Kurt Golder. “I don’t think 
we were a good enough team to 
get past Oklahoma. We would 
have had to be perfect and they 
would have had to falter in order 
to get by them.”

Keeping in stride with their 

last two titles, the Wolverines 
went with the same event order 
that had worked so well in 
the past two years. Their first 
rotation of the night was the 
pommel horse, where senior 
Adrian de los Angeles led the 
way with a 15.00, followed 
closely behind by junior Nolan 
Novak, 
who 
scored 
14.85. 

Despite these strong efforts, 
Michigan couldn’t keep up with 
its competition and found itself 
sixth after its first event. That 
deficit proved to be too much, as 
Michigan never rose higher than 
fourth on the night.

The Wolverines made up for 

lost points on the still rings. 
With big scores from seniors Hub 
Humphrey and Colin Mahar, 
Michigan tallied its highest rings 
score of the season with a total of 
73.90. However, the Wolverines 
were still in a disappointing 

fifth place, and would stay there 
during their best event of the 
season — the vault. Despite 
high scores from senior Paul 
Rizkalla and sophomore Anthony 
Stefanelli, their points were 
not able to make up for a pair of 
missed landings.

Michigan moved up to fourth 

place after a strong parallel 
bars 
performance. 
Freshman 

Dmitri Belanovski made a major 
contribution to the Wolverines’ 
fourth rotation with a 14.85.

“It’s no surprise,” Golder said. 

“Dmitri is always a steady guy in 
practice. I’m so impressed with 
his consistency, and he’s only a 
freshman.”

Michigan 
ended 
its 
night 

with an exclamation point on 
floor. Senior Stacey Ervin and 
Rizkalla led the way with 15.50 
and 15.30, respectively. Both 
exercises played a key role in 
earning a season-high total of 
75.60 in the event. Unfortunately 
for Michigan, the scores weren’t 
enough to push the Wolverines 

out of fourth place.

Four gymnasts represented 

Michigan the following day in 
the individual event finals. Novak 
and de los Angeles competed on 
pommel horse, and Novak, with 
a stunning 14.77, finished second 
in the event.

Belanovski wowed again on 

the high bar, where he tied for 
third with 15.025, just 0.1 points 
away from first. Also tying for 
third, Ervin earned 15.575 on 
floor. He, Belanovski and Novak 
all earned All-American honors.

“I find it interesting,” Golder 

said. “(Ervin and Belanovski) 
have been roommates on the road 
all season and they both end up 
tying for third in their events. It’s 
funny how that worked out.”

A pure coincidence between 

a freshman and senior ended 
the disappointing weekend on a 
more positive note. And as Ervin 
steps down as a team leader, 
Belanovski steps in as a new star 
of the team and, possibly, a sign of 
things to come.

Jim Hackett’s 
indefinite tenure

N

early half a year into 
his indefinite tenure 
as Michigan’s interim 

athletic 
director, 
Jim Hackett 
hasn’t been 
very vocal 
about his 
stay.

One of his 

only clues 
as to how 
long his term 
will last 
is that it’s 
contingent on a discussion with 
his wife, Kathy. He noted it 
at a press conference on Nov. 
22 and now, most recently, on 
April 1 after a fireside chat.

Maybe he hasn’t had time to 

finish that talk. After all, he has 
been busy hiring a new football 
coach and working to revitalize 
the fan and player experience 
at football games. But there’s 
something disconcerting about 
one discussion impacting the 
athletic department’s future.

It’s considerate that Jim 

Hackett is taking on such a 
big responsibility with his 
partner. He hasn’t been more 
transparent about his stay since 
expressing that sentiment, 
though, as the athletic year 
comes to an end with work still 
to be done.

Because as well as Hackett 

has handled everything, 
you, the fan of Michigan 
athletics, should be aware of 
the impact of his tenure on the 
greater vision of the Athletic 
Department — the things that 
don’t relate to Jim Harbaugh.

Jim Hackett says he won’t 

think of his term as a matter 
of time; he says it’s about 
accomplishing his priorities 
before he figures out his 
future. That’s a nice policy for 
building a house or cooking 
for your housemates, but 
not so much for the athletic 
director of a program that saw 
fans protest at the University 
President’s house just half a 
year ago.

He has received praise from 

fans for his work with the team, 
but before you get too excited, 
consider that his interim tag 
could create problems on the 

execution of that vision.

During Dave Brandon’s 

tenure, the University’s Board 
of Regents announced an 
initiative to expand and revamp 
its athletic campus for smaller 
sports. Part of it, including 
offices and facilities for field 
hockey, softball and both 
basketball teams, was already 
completed before Hackett 
started on Oct. 31.

The proposed renovations 

would impact two-thirds of 
Michigan’s 27 athletic teams, 
including the construction 
of a new track and new 
rowing facility as well as 
the expansion of Canham 
Natatorium and Cliff Keen 
Arena. You can still see the 
effort to bring in donations, 
which is a hefty, long-term 
project that features teams of 
associates spread out across 
the country. Those teams 
need someone to commit to 
seeing them through, which 
can be made easier by setting a 
timetable.

The funding for the project 

is a task in itself, and it requires 
the help from donors, people 
like Stephen M. Ross. Last 
year, Ross donated $100 
million to the athletic campus, 
in part because of his close 
relationship with Brandon — 
he told The Detroit News in 
a report published Thursday 
that he was in favor of Brandon 
staying.

Ross told the paper, 

“Michigan now needs to hire 
the next athletic director 
because Jim is the interim 
one. That’s what everybody 
is expecting, and you can see 
what happens when people 
don’t agree with something at 
Michigan.” If the biggest donor 
to the athletic department, the 
one who the athletic campus 
is named after, is expecting 
a new athletic director, then 
it’s important to clarify his 
intentions for others.

Many people are already on 

board with what’s done, but 
it isn’t made easier when he 
hasn’t set a timetable for how 
long he’ll be around. It might 
be tough to convince a donor to 
give money when they have no 
idea how long he’ll be around to 

utilize it.

And how does he build 

the relationship between the 
administration, including a 
president that still has little 
experience in athletics, to 
trust bigger decisions about 
the expansion of facilities or 
fundraising efforts? It might 
be tough to approve something 
knowing the athletic director 
might be out to see the project 
through.

Hackett has already worked 

to bring back the tradition in 
the football program, letting 
Jim Harbaugh make the calls 
on music played at the Big 
House or even the color of the 
cleats. These things please 
donors, because they’re a 
return to some of the program’s 
core values, but how much 
more can Hackett finish before 
time is up?

Music and cleats are quick 

fixes. Athletic facilities and 
stability are long-term projects 
that become more important in 
the grand scheme of things.

If he were to leave now, then 

the department would already 
be set back to rebuilding 
relationships with coaches 
and players again. But being 
transparent about his stay is 
helpful in picking the next 
leader. Then the replacement 
process doesn’t have to be 
rushed.

Maybe that person is 

Hackett, who has filled in 
admirably. But the athletic year 
is coming to an end, and you 
don’t know what’s coming next 
because you don’t know how 
long the leader will be there. 
And if he does know more, you 
don’t know what it is because 
he hasn’t shared.

There’s no harm in setting 

a timetable for everyone. But 
what’s the benefit to keeping 
his tenure a mystery?

As head of one of the biggest 

branches of the University, 
Hackett has managed things 
as well as he could have been 
asked. Imagine how much 
more he could do with one 
discussion.

women’s boxing, though, and 
without connections in the sport, 
Johnson was unable to find a foe. 
She finally booked her first fight 
during her junior year — without 
telling her parents until after, 
when she told them she won.

“We said, ‘If you’re gonna do 

something, put everything you 
have into it,’ and she has,” Sandy 
Johnson said. “After, when we 
see the film, we know that she’s 
won. That makes it a lot easier.”

Friday, Sandy and Ed Johnson 

watched their daughter box in 
person for the first time at the 
Intramural 
Sports 
Building, 

which hosted the USIBA College 
National Championships.

And Johnson got all she could 

handle early from her opponent, 
Army’s Gaby Barrera-Gutierrez.

Barrera-Gutierrez came out 

with a series of frantic punches, 
looking to wear down Johnson. 
But Johnson, who, according to 
her father, runs eight to 10 miles 
per day, withstood the flurry. She 
stood her ground and went into 
the first break looking confident, 
while Gutierrez looked already 
fatigued.

Normally, Johnson said, she 

respects her opponents so much 
that she doesn’t hold grudges 
during or after a match. This one 
was different, though.

Johnson 
was 
actually 

supposed 
to 
fight 
Barrera-

Gutierrez on Thursday, leaving 
her open for a different match 
Friday and an appearance at 
the Golden Gloves tournament 
in Detroit on Saturday. But 
Gutierrez didn’t arrive at the 
tournament, 
delaying 
their 

match to Friday and forcing her 
to choose between Golden Gloves 
and another USIBA fight.

“I was mad at her,” Johnson 

said.

In 
the 
second 
round, 

Johnson used that anger as fuel 
and 
capitalized 
on 
Barrera-

Gutierrez’s exhaustion. Taking 
control of the pace, she landed 
combo blows and jabs to the 
side of Barrera-Gutierrez’s head, 
leading to a standing eight count 
just before the second bell.

With her winning formula 

already established, she backed 
Gutierrez into the ropes at the 
start of the third round. Pushing 
her along the edge of the ring, 
Johnson landed a series of 
combos to the body and head, 
relentlessly exploiting openings 
until the referee called the match.

“I realized she had a pause 

when she was swinging when 
she was tired,” Johnson said. “I 
figured she probably couldn’t 
take hard punches. So that’s what 
I tried to do — just clean, hard 
shots.”

Outwardly unassuming and 

modest, Johnson is a tactician 
in the ring, strategizing while 
dodging open fists and ducking 
closed ones.

And if she seems surprisingly 

proficient for a boxer with 
just two years of live fighting 
experience, her other role might 
be even more shocking.

Since women’s boxing doesn’t 

technically 
have 
club 
sport 

status at the University, Johnson 
also serves as one of the team’s 
volunteer coaches. When she 
wasn’t fighting, she was ringside, 
cheering the other Michigan 
women to the team title.

Five Wolverine women won 

individual titles over the weekend, 
knocking 
two-time 
defending 

champion Army from its pedestal 
in resounding fashion.

And it’s no wonder why they 

were able to rise to such heights 
so 
fast. 
Johnson’s 
workout 

routine is so intense that a SWAT 
team once trained with her and, 
as first reported by WCBN, it 
was so intense that some of the 
members threw up from it.

The small, redheaded senior 

helped build the program to a 
national title contender, even 
without school funding or a 
full coaching staff, which the 
Michigan men have. Next year, 
even 
though 
she 
will 
have 

graduated, she hopes it will 
finally get some of the same 
advantages the men do.

Johnson will hit her head on a 

brick wall if that’s what it takes. 
Maybe five individual titles and 
a team national championship 
will do the trick instead. It 
might save the brick wall some 
embarrassment.

Michigan sweeps Rutgers

By TYLER SCOTT

Daily Sports Writer

After a year and a half on 

the Michigan softball team, 
Abby Ramirez hit her first 
career 
home 
run 
Saturday. 

For an encore, the sophomore 
shortstop jacked a three-run 
shot to give the Wolverines the 
lead in the Sunday game. In nine 
at-bats, Ramirez hit .889 for 
the weekend. Ramirez was on 
fire all weekend, but she wasn‘t 
alone. The seventh through 
ninth hitters combined for 11 
hits as the Wolverines swept the 
Rutgers.

“We’re a team, and we need 

everybody on the team doing 
their part, because the same 
people aren’t always going to get 
it done,” said Michigan coach 
Carol 
Hutchins. 
“(Ramirez) 

was in a great groove over the 
weekend. … But we need the 
bottom of the order to contribute, 
and they were fantastic this 
weekend.”

Before the weekend series, 

Rutgers (7-5 Big Ten, 20-12 
Overall) and Michigan (10-2 
Big Ten, 37-6 Overall) were tied 
for second place in the Big Ten 
softball standings.

But you couldn’t tell that was 

the case on the field.

No. 4 Michigan trounced 

Rutgers in games one and two 
by scores of 18-0 and 16-3, 
respectively. In Sunday’s finale, 
the Wolverines batted in fewer 
runs, but still won 5-0 to earn 
the series sweep. With the wins, 
Michigan is now alone on top of 
the Big Ten standings, edging 
out Northwestern for the lead by 
way of win percentage.

In the leadoff at-bat of the 

series, junior centerfielder Sierra 
Lawrence lifted a homer over the 
left-field wall. It was a precursor 
to the onslaught that buried the 
Scarlet Knights through the first 
two games.

Michigan scored 17 runs in 

three innings as it mowed its way 
through Rutgers’ bullpen. Three 
pitchers besides the starter, left-
hander Alyssa Landrith, saw 
action in Friday’s opener, but 
none could stymie the Wolverine 
offense. Junior second baseman 
Sierra 
Romero, 
sophomore 

outfielder Kelly Christner and 
junior right fielder Kelsey Susalla 
all homered as part of a seven-
run fourth inning. Christner 
homered again her next time up 
as Michigan added seven more 
runs in the fifth.

“When 
we 
have 
good 

weekends, it’s usually because 
we’re relaxed and not getting in 
our own heads,” Ramirez said. 
“When everyone’s playing really 
well, we’re all playing really 
loose and we’re not pressing to 
get hits or anything, we go up 
there kind of relaxed.”

With the bats as hot as they 

were, 
Michigan’s 
pitching 

staff had a massive margin for 
error, but it didn’t need one. 
Sophomore right-hander Megan 
Betsa pitched Friday, giving up 
just three hits and recording 
nine strikeouts through five 
innings in the run-rule victory.

Senior 
left-hander 
Haylie 

Wagner was in the circle for 
game two when the Scarlet 
Knights scored their only runs 
of the weekend. Wagner allowed 
just four hits and one earned run 
with three strikeouts, but an ill-

timed error by Sierra Romero at 
second base allowed a runner to 
advance and eventually score.

Rutgers 
capitalized 
on 

Michigan’s defensive missteps 
to score two runs in the second, 
and 
Scarlet 
Knights 
first 

baseman Rebecca Hall jacked a 
solo home run in the fourth to 
provide Rutgers its only offense.

“There were a few slip ups, but 

we were able to bounce back,” 
said 
senior 
catcher 
Lauren 

Sweet. “That’s a huge thing. 
Defense is the most important 
part of the game, and our 
pitchers really came out to play.”

Michigan sidestepped every 

challenge that Rutgers cooked 
up for it. In the series finale, 
Landrith returned to the circle 
seemingly well equipped for 
the potency of the Wolverines’ 
lineup. Instead of a slugfest 
like in game one, the Michigan 
offense was contained to just 
two productive innings.

The three-run homer from 

Ramirez in the second inning 
was the only difference until 
Lawrence knocked in a two-
run single in the sixth frame. 
Betsa chalked another superb 
start, allowing just two hits and 
striking out 14 Rutgers batters.

Happy with the results of the 

weekend and her team’s place 
atop the conference, Hutchins is 
still looking for ways to improve 
her team with the postseason 
looming.

“I want to focus on Michigan 

and what Michigan does well,” 
Hutchins said. “That’s our brand 
... we swing, and we swing well. 
We just have to stay with that 
and just continue to get a little 
bit better around the edges.”

Wolverines rebound 
to win series on road

By DANNY VARGOVICK

Daily Sports Writer

It won’t be the start that sticks 

out from the Michigan baseball 
team’s series this weekend. It 
will be the finish.

This weekend, the Wolverines 

started horribly with an 11-1 
beatdown at the hands of Penn 
State (10-20 overall, 2-6 Big Ten).

After the game, Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich told his 
team that it just needed to put 
the game in the past and forget 
about it.

And that’s exactly what it did, 

rallying on Saturday and Sunday 
to take the series with 5-3 and 
8-3 wins in State College.

For the Wolverines, the heroes 

of the turnaround on Saturday 
and Sunday were the starting 
pitchers. Freshman right-hander 
Ryan Nutof and sophomore left-
hander Brett Adcock both went 
six innings, allowing only one 
earned run combined.

Nutof wasn’t at his absolute 

best, but he was good enough. 
In his six innings, he allowed 
five hits and four walks while 
striking out two.

Sunday, Adcock allowed just 

two hits and struck out six, but 
two unearned runs scored on 
errors by junior second baseman 
Jacob Cronenworth in the third 
inning and freshman shortstop 
Jake Bivens in the fourth.

Bakich has been tinkering 

with his infield defense since 
the return of junior infielder 
Travis Maezes. At the start of 
the season, Cronenworth was 
at first, Maezes at shortstop, 
senior Eric Jacobson at second 
and freshman Drew Lugbauer 
at third. In Maezes’ absence, 
Bivens emerged into an everyday 
player, registering a .422 on-base 
percentage.

Sunday, 
though, 
Maezes 

showed why it’s worth the 

effort to juggle the lineup to 
accommodate him. He went 
3-for-4 with two clutch doubles 
to bring home four Wolverine 
base runners.

The 
other 
offensive 
star 

for 
Michigan 
was 
senior 

centerfielder 
Jackson 
Glines. 

After leading the Big Ten in 
hitting for the majority of the 
season, Glines was held to 
just two hits in last weekend’s 
series win against Indiana. This 
weekend, he collected four hits 
— two doubles, a triple and a 
single.

After starting the year coming 

off the bench, sophomore right 
fielder Johnny Slater received 
three starts this weekend. He 
has dynamic speed, but so far 
in his career, his high strikeout 
and low walk rates have limited 
his ability to use his speed on the 
bases.

Friday, 
Slater 
recorded 
a 

single and a stolen base. He 
wasn’t able to score, but he didn’t 
strike out. Saturday, he had two 
singles, one on a bunt, but struck 

out twice, got picked off once 
and didn’t score. Sunday, though, 
he recorded one single, didn’t 
strike out and, in his final plate 
appearance of the weekend, 
walked and scored.

Bakich said he has been 

impressed with Slater, and that 
players like him are what make it 
so difficult for opposing pitchers 
to get through the Wolverine 
lineup.

This 
series 
was 
another 

testament to the Wolverines 
being real contenders this year.

Baseball is a game that has 

a large and vitally important 
mental component, and this 
team had the mental fortitude to 
move past a debilitating 11-1 loss 
Friday and turn things around 
and win the series.

After statement wins against 

Big Ten favorite Maryland and 
Big Ten defending champion 
Indiana in the previous two 
weekends, 
this 
weekend 

could’ve been a trap for a lesser 
team.

But for this team, it wasn’t.

WOMEN’S TENNIS
‘M’ adds two home wins

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

As the No. 14 Michigan 

women’s tennis team ended its 
match Saturday, the focus was 
on senior Kristen Dodge.

Dodge was trying to join 

fellow seniors Emina Bektas and 
Sarah Lee with wins on Senior 
Day.

After a tough first set in 

which she won in a seven-point 
tiebreak, Dodge cruised to a 
6-1 second-set victory to win 
the final home 
match of her 
career.

“I have had 

such a passion 
for 
Michigan 

my 
whole 

life,” 
Dodge 

said. “It’s been 
truly a blessing being able to be 
here for four years, and now I’m 
just glad I could make everyone 
proud and my family proud, to 
win one last match and to have 
(my family) see me play one last 
time.”

The success for the seniors 

was part of another impressive 
weekend for the Wolverines, 
who defeated in-state rival 
Michigan State, 7-0, on Friday 
and took down Memphis, 6-1, on 
Saturday.

Against 
the 
Spartans, 

Michigan took the doubles point 
with an 8-3 win from the No. 13 

team of Bektas and freshman 
Alex Najarian and an 8-6 win 
from freshman Mira Ruder-
Hook 
and 
sophomore 
Sara 

Remynse.

Bektas took the momentum 

to singles, winning the No. 1 
singles match, 6-2, 6-0.

Ruder-Hook 
finished 
her 

match next with an equally 
impressive 
performance, 

winning in straight sets without 
dropping a single game.

Lee eventually clinched the 

match for Michigan, winning 

6-0, 6-3.

“It 
means 

so much to 
be 
part 
of 

this,” 
Lee 

said. “Mostly 
because 
of 

how 
much 

it has given 

me and sort of taught me about 
leadership and what it’s like 
to be on a team with amazing 
girls.”

Najarian, Remynse and junior 

Ronit Yurovsky each added wins 
to the Wolverines’ total to give 
Michigan the clean sweep.

Saturday, the weather was 

nice enough for the team to play 
its first home outdoor match 
of the season, when it took on 
Memphis.

In doubles play, Lee and 

Yurovsky won 8-2, while the 
team of Ruder-Hook and Dodge 
won 8-3 to give Michigan the 

doubles point.

Following 
the 
doubles 

matches, the seniors were joined 
on the courts by their families 
and were honored by the team.

“It’s crazy that four years 

have gone by this fast,” Bektas 
said. “I think the biggest thing 
I’m going to take away is the 
people I’ve been around. My 
teammates and my coaches 
have helped me grow as a tennis 
player and as a person so much.”

Lee built on her success from 

Friday, using her drop shot 
to secure a win at the third 
position, 6-3, 6-1.

“The drop shot is kind of my 

go-to,” Lee said. “I love hitting 
the drop shot but she especially 
stood really far back so it worked 
very well today and whenever I 
had a chance I would go for the 
drop shots.”

Bektas clinched the win with 

a 6-3, 7-5 victory at the No. 1 
spot.

The 
weekend’s 
only 
loss 

for the Wolverines came on 
Saturday when Najarian lost 
a three-set match, ending her 
team-best 12 match win streak.

“It’s good. You want to get 

pushed,” said Michigan coach 
Ronni Bernstein. “When you 
win easy and then you get put in 
those tough situations you might 
doubt if you can get through. 
I think this was very good for 
us heading into next Friday 
(against No. 18 Ohio State).”

Wolverines fail to finish 
big possessions vs. OSU

Struggles in 
faceoffs doom 

Michigan in close 

loss to rival

By BRANDON CARNEY

Daily Sports Writer

The combination of one of 

the nation’s tightest defenses 
and country’s top faceoff men 
proved fatal for the Michigan 
men’s lacrosse team.

Coming into Sunday, the 

Wolverines 
understood 
all 

scoring 
opportunities 
were 

going to be at a premium 
against No. 11 Ohio State (3-0 
Big Ten, 10-3 overall). Knowing 
how valuable every offensive 
possession would be against 
the Buckeyes’ No. 9 scoring 
defense, the Wolverines had to 
change their mental mindset 
while attacking. Michigan (1-2, 
5-6) ended up taking 35 shots, 
just four fewer than Ohio State, 
but converted a mere 22 percent 
into goals in a 13-8 loss.

Last week against Rutgers, 

Michigan 
was 
drastically 

beaten in the faceoff circle, yet 
found ways to finish and score 
with high-percentage shots in 
its 10-8 victory. Facing a similar 
setup against the Buckeyes, 
the Wolverines lost the faceoff 
battle Sunday, 16-9, and couldn’t 
repeat what had worked with 
limited possession against the 
Scarlet Knights.

“Every team in the Big Ten 

is so loaded at faceoff that we 
know how big the possession 
battle is,” said senior attacker 
Will Meter. “We prepared for 
that and it was a part of our 
offense but once we were late in 
the game and fell back a couple 
goals, that’s when we started 

pushing the tempo.”

The 
most 
noticeable 

difference 
for 
Michigan 

between 
the 
Rutgers 
and 

Ohio 
State 

matchups 
was 
its 

speed on the 
offensive 
end. 
Slow, 

methodical 
attacks 
helped 
the 

Wolverines 
score 
when 

they needed 
to last week.

But against the Buckeyes, 

Michigan found itself often 
rushing 
to 
get 
shots 
off, 

especially when trying to come 
from behind in the second half. 
The Wolverines broke away 
from their offensive identity, 
costing them a chance at an 
upset.

“Usually, we’d need to slow 

it down, and make sure our 
defense is resting,” Meter said. 
“That’s 
hard. 
When 
you’re 

behind in a game, you can’t fall 
into that (tempo) so many times. 
It kind of creates a spiral where 
we’re trying to go too fast, and 
if we lose the possession then it 
goes back to the other end, and 
that’s where we got stuck.”

In addition to poor shooting 

as a result of the faster tempo, 
the Wolverines made several 
small mental errors that ended 
up having a large effect on the 
game’s 
outcome. 
Michigan 

committed 14 turnovers and 
four 
penalties 
that 
mostly 

occurred in transition, leading 
to easy goals for Ohio State.

“We thought we’d be able 

to clear the ball better,” said 
Michigan coach John Paul. 
“We were making some pretty 
fundamental errors there. If 
we clear the ball better and 

get a few more possessions, 
then maybe some of the other 
numbers mean something a 
little bit more.”

As much as 

the Wolverines 
hurt 
themselves 
during crucial 
attacks, 
the 

Buckeye 
defense 
stepped 
up 

and 
stopped 

Michigan from 
finding 
any 

offensive momentum.

Ohio 
State 
managed 
to 

force 
the 
Wolverines’ 
top 

scorers into harder shots and 
fewer opportunities to pass. 
Sophomore attacker Ian King 
and 
sophomore 
midfielder 

Mikie Schlossler combined for 
17 shots, but scored just twice 
due to defensive pressure.

Despite what happens on the 

attacking end, the key to solving 
Michigan’s possession problem 
will have to take place at where 
it starts. The Wolverines were 
crushed on faceoffs all day, and 
rotated between three players 
to take draws. Michigan finally 
settled on sophomore midfielder 
Chase Brown, who also was the 
Wolverines’ only healthy option 
in defensive midfield.

Whether 
it’s 
Brown 
or 

Michigan’s starting faceoff man 
— junior specialist Brad Lott 
— taking draws in the future, 
Paul just hopes someone will 
step up and fix the Wolverines’ 
possession 
troubles 
at 
the 

source.

“We’ve got to be better at 

facing off,” Paul said. “When 
we’re playing very good teams 
and we’re also at a faceoff 
disadvantage everything else 
has to go perfect. If it doesn’t, 
then this is what happens.”

‘M’ falls to Ohio State

By RILEY NELSON

Daily Sports Writer

The conditions Sunday could 

not have been better for the 
Michigan’s men’s lacrosse team 
as it squared off against Ohio 
State.

But 

on 
such 

a perfect day, the Wolverines 
(1-2 Big Ten, 5-6 overall) were 
far from perfect, losing to the 
11th-ranked Buckeyes, 13-8.

The afternoon showed a hard-

fought battle on both sides, with 
a little extra fire underneath 
every player. The effort was there 
for Michigan, but the deciding 
factor in Sunday’s matchup was 
ultimately possessions.

The Buckeyes won 64 percent 

of the faceoffs, something the 
Wolverines expected, but it still 
ended up costing them.

“Initially, they got a lot of 

possessions, 
which 
affected 

us 
early,” 
said 
sophomore 

defenseman Andrew Hatton. 
“I think we can do a lot better 
of a job clearing, picking up 
the ground balls, getting those 
possessions and settling it once 
we have it.”

The Wolverines were strong 

in the first half, leading Ohio 
State by one or two goals for 
most of the second quarter. 
Michigan redshirt sophomore 
goaltender Gerald Logan and the 
rest of the defense did not allow 
the Buckeyes to score for over 20 
minutes at one 
point.

But 
when 

Ohio State did 
score, 
things 

fell apart for 
Michigan.

The 

Wolverines 
only 
had 
14 

successful 
clears on 21 attempts, giving the 
Buckeyes more opportunities 
than they deserved.

“We knew it was going to 

be a possession battle coming 
into it,” said senior attacker 
and 
co-captain 
Will 
Meter. 

“Obviously, they’re very good 
offensively, so when you give 
them opportunities, it’s going to 
be pretty tough for you.”

Meter, along with five of his 

teammates, each tallied one 
goal, while junior midfielder 
Kyle Jackson notched two goals.

While 
both 
the 
statistics 

and team say that the lack of 
possession was the deciding 
factor of this game, Michigan 
instead chose to focus on the 
positives.

“Our effort was outstanding,” 

said Michigan coach John Paul. 

“The 
energy 

to 
start 
the 

game 
was 

outstanding. 
If 
we 
could 

bottle that first 
quarter 
and 

bring that out 
every 
single 

time we play 
a quarter of 

lacrosse, we’re going to be in 
pretty good shape no matter who 
we’re playing.”

Added 
Meter: 
“Everyone’s 

really excited with the direction 
of the team and where it’s going. 
We don’t look at it as there’s 
two weeks left in the regular 
season and we’re fighting for our 
lives to get a position. There’s 
an opportunity in front of us, 
and let’s see where we can get a 
seeding position. I think if we 
continue the confidence … good 
things are going to happen.”

“We knew it was 

going to be a 

possession battle.”

“Every team 
in the Big Ten 
is so loaded at 

faceoff.”

college boxing is entering a new 
age of growth, and Michigan is 
right in the middle of it.

“It’s fantastic,” Sensoli said. 

“The line I keep saying is that 
‘These are the good ol’ days. These 
are the peak times we’ve ever had 
for Michigan boxing.’ It’s going to 
be hard to top the last two years.”

In 
most 
people’s 
minds, 

the golden age of boxing was 
generations ago. A varsity sport 
until an athlete death ended 
such competition in 1960, the 
combative and gory nature of 
boxing that once made it one of 
America’s most popular sports 
was also its downfall. This 
sentiment returned just a few 
years ago, when Michigan club 
boxing was kicked off campus, 
unable to compete.

Practicing 
in 
coaches’ 

backyards and becoming self-
sufficient, the Wolverines not only 
came back swinging, but with a 
fresh new look. Joining the newly 
formed USIBA and emphasizing 
a female team, Michigan found 

previously unheard of success, 
winning more individual national 
titles (12) in the past two years 
than in decades of club boxing.

But as this year showed, the 

rest of the nation is following 
suit. Newcomer Virginia Military 
Institute took the men’s title, 
while numerous other teams 
made their debuts in Ann Arbor. 
The increase of teams makes the 
event a special one in the boxing 
world.

“I’ve never seen support the 

teammates have for each other 
as we have in college boxing, no 
matter where we go,” said USA 
Boxing Chief of Officials Mac 
McCadden. “A lot of it is because 
these young folks, they’re not 
going to be professional boxers. 
They’re going to be doctors, 
lawyers, take care of my cars. They 
have all these other aspirations. 
They do this because they love to 
do it and it’s fun.

“I can’t tell you how much 

improvement we’ve seen. The 
resurgence of college boxing is 
tremendous for us. You can tell 
with the increased number of 
athletes and quality of fights 
in just a few years. As long as it 

continues to grow, the sky’s the 
limit.”

For three days the IMSB gym 

was constantly filled with bouts of 
all weight classes and skill levels. 
But in contrast to college boxing 
competitions of the past, it was 
clear that boxing was no longer a 
boys’ club.

“I remember my Dad coming 

home a few years ago saying like 
‘There’s a girl trying out,’ and we 
all thought it was kind of weird,” 
said junior Alec Sensoli, whose 
father coaches both teams. “Then 
that one girl blossomed into more, 
and now it’s just this big thing, 
and it’s amazing. They went from 
nothing to team champions.”

Behind 
the 

training 
and 

leadership 
of 
defending 

champion 
Kate Johnson, 
the 
women’s 

team not only 
bested 
the 

competition, but obliterated it en 
route to the team title.

Looking to match, the men sent 

seven competitors to the finals, 
including an open bout between 
senior and team president Kevin 
Bosma and VMI’s Nick O’Leary 
that proved to be the apex of the 
event. But the two-time defending 
national champion Bosma fell by 
TKO, leaving the younger Sensoli 
as the lone male champion.

“Kevin’s OK, (but) that was a 

rough one,” Tony Sensoli said. 
“He’s our leader and the backbone 
of our team, he’s carried us 
through these last couple years 
and is a big part of where this 
team is. He’s the best kid that I’ve 

ever coached, or as a person. So 
I hate to see him go out this way, 
but I know he’ll bounce back, he’s 
a terrific kid.”

More 
importantly, 
both 

Michigan and college boxing 
found success on its biggest stage 
yet, ensuring that it can be a main 
event for the good ol’ days to come.

“I used to go to practices and 

fights when I was younger, and 
it kind of died off,” Alec Sensoli 
said. “But now it’s getting big 
again, and it’s just awesome to see. 
Boxing’s kind of making a little bit 
of a comeback, but it’s great seeing 
college boxing where it is today.”

Added McCadden: “The quality 

of the boxers has improved 

tremendously 
in three years. 
I think a lot 
of it has to 
do 
with 
the 

enthusiasm, 
the 
camaraderie 
these 

teammates have for each other, 
and the ability to not be envious 
of each other and share each other 
and to support each other.”

“That’s something you don’t 

see in any other level of boxing.”

Following 
the 
final 
bell, 

fans, 
athletes 
and 
officials 

were mingling around the area, 
taking in the final moments of 
the experience. When a group 
of elementary-school girls were 
shadow boxing outside of the 
building, it was clear that the 
resurgence of college boxing 
also marked a clear change 
in culture around the sport, 
making it a comeback that just 
might last.

MEN’S TENNIS
Michigan rebounds 
for Senior Day win

By ALEX KHALIFEH

Daily Sports Writer

It’s not easy to compete in back-

to-back matches on consecutive 
days. Struggling in the first one 
doesn’t make it any easier.

But that’s what the Michigan 

men’s tennis team went through 
this weekend when it faced 
Minnesota on Saturday and 
Wisconsin on Sunday.

With the the Little Brown 

Jug on the line, Michigan (2-7 
Big Ten, 5-15 overall) faced 
early deficits in each of its 
three doubles matches against 
Minnesota (8-1, 17-6).

There 
were 
opportunities 

for the Wolverines to shift 
momentum in their favor. The 
No. 2 doubles duo of redshirt 
freshman 
Alex 
Knight 
and 

freshman Leo Hua attempted to 
come back against the Golden 
Gophers’ 
Felix 
Corwin 
and 

Leandro Toledo, cutting their 
lead to 7-5. But Knight and 
Hua were unable to ride their 
momentum, ultimately losing, 
8-5.

In that case, and overall, 

the Wolverines were unable to 
capitalize.

“(Corwin 
and 
Toledo’s) 

returns were really good,” Hua 
said. “They were on top of us 
after their returns … we weren’t 
dictating the points … they had a 
good edge over us.”

Though Hua and Knight lost 

in doubles, Hua’s performance 
at No. 3 singles was worthy of 
recognition, as it was the only 
point Michigan won in a 6-1 
defeat.

After 
taking 
a 
loss 
to 

Minnesota, 
Michigan 
found 

much 
more 
success 
against 

Wisconsin (3-6, 7-15).

The Wolverines came out 

strong, as the No. 3 doubles duo 
of sophomores Kevin Wong and 
Tyler Gardiner won six straight 
games to come back and beat 
the Badgers’ Jakhongir Jalalov 
and Michael Sinha, 8-6. The 
comeback secured the doubles 
point for the Wolverines.

“I think, mentally, (Gardiner 

and Wong) felt like (Jalalov and 
Sinha) weren’t better than them,” 
Michigan coach Adam Steinberg 
said. “They got a game and saw 
what happened. … (That match) 
was huge. We needed that.”

The doubles point, followed by 

three straight singles victories by 
Hua, Wong and Knight, helped 
Michigan earn a 4-0 lead against 
Wisconsin.

Though the match was already 

decided, eyes focused on seniors 
Michael Zhu and Alex Petrone, 
who looked to grab victories in 
their final matches at the Varsity 
Tennis Center.

While he was frustrated by 

his play against Wisconsin’s 
Jalalov, Petrone made efforts to 
work on his court movement and 
got to balls quickly. Despite the 
adjustments, Petrone lost in a 
third-set tiebreaker, 10-5.

Zhu faced similar difficulty 

against 
the 
Badgers’ 
Josef 

Dodridge. After losing his first 
set, 7-5, Zhu struck back in the 
second, to the tune of winning 
four straight games. He went on 
to win, 6-1.

In the tiebreaker, with his 

chance to serve and leading 9-8, 
Zhu committed a double fault.

“(After that error), I was pissed 

off at myself,” Zhu said. “The 
only positive aspect about getting 
pissed off is you use it to drive 
yourself to win the next point. It’s 
bad to let it consume you.”

Zhu showcased his ability to 

let go of the mistake, securing the 
tie breaking set with two straight 
points and winning, 11-9.

For Zhu and Petrone, they say 

goodbye to a place they called 
home court for four years. But 
Zhu found time to put his final 
game into perspective and not let 
the emotions get ahead of him.

“Just thinking: It’s the last 

time I’m warming up before a 
dual match,” Zhu said. “It’s the 
last time hearing the national 
anthem, 
last 
time 
huddling 

together over the block ‘M.’ But 
once you start playing, it’s like 
any other day.”
