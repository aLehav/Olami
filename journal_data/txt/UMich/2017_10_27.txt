ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The University of Michigan 

— which, in January of this year, 
was ranked last in overall social 
mobility in a report from the 
Equality of Opportunity Project 
website — has been aggressively 
ramping up its efforts to recruit 
a greater socioeconomic range of 
students. In June, the University 
presented its Go Blue Guarantee, 
which allows any in-state student 
coming from a family with 
annual income below the state 
median of $65,000 to have their 
tuition completely covered by the 
University. 

Kedra Ishop, vice provost 

for 
enrollment 
management, 

said even though the Go Blue 
Guarantee isn’t vastly different 
from what the University already 
offers in terms of total aid, one of 
its major intents was making the 
message clearer for students.

“One of the premises of the 

Go Blue Guarantee was to recast 
our message, in the sense that we 
have aid available for students at 
the University of Michigan and 
we wanted to make sure that the 
public understands we have that 
aid available for students at the 
University of Michigan,” she said.

And, 
at 
least 
in 
certain 

underserved communities, the 
guarantee has had that effect. 
Rackham student Richard Nunn 
advises the student organization 
PILOT, which runs a project 
aiming to create meaningful 

relationships with new students 
from 
underrepresented 
and 

marginalized 
communities. 

Earlier this month, Nunn hosted 
an orientation of high school 
students from the Little Traverse 
Bay Bands of Odawa Indians and 
he said the students seemed very 
responsive to the news of the 
guarantee.

“For a lot of these students 

and 
for 
(their 
mentors) 
as 

professionals, it really kind of 
made U of M seem more attractive 
in some ways, in terms of, ‘Now 

we know we can afford to go 
there,’ “ he said.

Kerstine Bennington, a higher 

education specialist for and citizen 
of the tribe, agreed that for many 
of the students she works with, 
attending college — especially the 
University of Michigan — seems 
unattainable.

“Last semester, I had a lot of 

high school students who aren’t 
going to pursue college because 
they just think that they can’t 
afford it and they’ll have family 
members that couldn’t do that in 

the past and then go off of their 
experience and it’s just really hard 
trying to get through to them,” 
she said. “You hear ‘university’ 
and you already think that you 
can’t afford it. This is coming 
from students that may not have 
even done the research, they just 
assumed — so being able to hear 
about the opportunity definitely 
changed their minds.”

In addition to incorporating 

messaging about the Go Blue 
Guarantee into the visits to the 
With the January deadline 

for the implementation of the Go 
Blue Guarantee free tuition pledge 
on the horizon, the University of 
Michigan posted a record number 
of applicants in figures released 
Thursday morning. The University 
also saw increased enrollment 
of 
underrepresented 
minority 

students and students receiving 
federal Pell Grants. Overall, campus 
enrollment increased 2.9 percent 
from last year to 46,002 students, 
with 29,821 undergraduates and 
16,181 graduate and professional 
school students.

The University also increased 

the 
amount 
of 
financial 
aid 

provided 
to 
undergraduate 

students by 10.6 percent, totaling 
$176.7 million. This aid is available 
to students with family incomes of 
up to $180,000.

Announced in June, the new 

Go 
Blue 
Guarantee 
program 

functions as the administration’s 
commitment to free tuition for 
in-state students from families 
with incomes less than $65,000. 
Approximately half of in-state 
families are expected to qualify.

Pulitzer-Prize-winning 

Washington Post reporter David 
Fahrenthold used social media 
throughout the 2016 presidential 
election to expose inconsistencies 
in the claims of now-President 
Donald Trump.

Trump 
insisted 
throughout 

the campaign he donated money 
to veterans groups, but upon 
contacting dozens of organizations 
— and documenting his finds on 
Twitter — Fahrenthold revealed 
there was no evidence to suggest 
Trump did so.

Fahrenthold was also the first 

reporter to reveal the “Access 
Hollywood” 
video 
in 
which 

Trump 
was 
heard 
bragging 

about 
inappropriately 
grabbing 

women. For these reports and 
more, Fahrenthold received the 
2017 Pulitzer Prize for national 
reporting in April.

As a part of the Bicentennial 

celebration, the University of 
Michigan held the Campus of 
the Future competition finale at 
the Power Center on Thursday 
to celebrate the finalists in 
the Student Project Showcase 
competition, held earlier that 
day at the Duderstadt Center. 

The third and final President’s 

Colloquium looked to the future 
of campus, turning to students 
to see what their imaginations 
saw for the University going 
into its third century. More 
than 100 students participated 
in the competition.

Thirty-four 
student

competition, with three judges 
choosing the winner. Kwame

Social Work masters students 
view unpaid field work as unfair

Required field education programs lack paid positions, contribute to financial instability

Despite being ranked first in its 

field for best graduate programs 
by 
the 
U.S. 
News 
& 
World 

Report earlier this year, a survey 
conducted last March by Fair Labor 
Organizing, a subcommittee of 

the School of Social Work Student 
Union, reported 73 percent of 110 
Social Work School respondents — 
more than 25 percent of Social Work 
students — said they work at least 
one more job on top of classes and 
field hours. 

Masters of Social Work students 

say the discrepancy between being 
ranked as the best social work 

program in the country and the 
large number of students who have 
to work outside their class schedule 
is a result of the program’s 912 field 
placement hours requirement — 
most of which are often completed 
through unpaid positions, such 
as 
mentorship 
programs 
with 

social workers and public outreach 
positions.

According to Lisa Raycraft, Social 

Work 
School 
communications 

and public relations manager, field 
education positions are a required 
part of the MSW program. Students 
complete on average 228 hours of 
field placement work per term and

of Field Instruction reports over 550

Every Friday, The Michigan 
Daily will be republishing an 
article from the Daily’s archives 
from a moment in University 
history. 

October 31, 1990 
— Ghastly 

ghouls and spooky sights are 
sure to attract scary souls 
tonight. 

That is if you’re not too old 

for Halloween. 

Unfortunately for horrific-

minded but responsible 
students, Halloween falls on 
a midweek evening amidst 
midterm anxiety. As a result, 
some of the fun has to wait 
until the weekend. 

“Halloween comes at a 

bad time this year,” said LSA 
sophomore Jonathon Marx. 
“I haven’t even thought of 
going out, especially since I 
have a midterm. Besides, most 
people either celebrated it last 
weekend or will this weekend.” 

Last weekend did not 

lack activities. East Quad 
did the “Halloween Thang” 
and R.O.T.C. sponsored its 
annual Haunted House before 
hundreds of scary souls. 

In spite of midterms, a 

multitude of parties have 
worked their way into students’ 
calendars this week. Among 
the Halloween personalities 
appearing this week are 
Phantom of the Opera, 
Medussa and the New Kids on 
the Block. 

Fantasy Attic, a popular 

costumer in Ann Arbor, is not 
surprised by their excellent 
sales this season. Lindsay 
James, a sales assistant, 
said “Dick Tracy, Breathless 
Mahoney and the Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles are the 
hot in demand this year. Pirates 
are always a favorite, too.”

Big kids aren’t holding a 

monopoly on fun in Ann Arbor 
this week. Residence halls, such 
as Mary Markley, East Quad 
and Stockwell, are taking part 
in Trick-or-Treating activities 
for local children. Student 
residents who signed up are 
visited by area kids making the 
candy rounds. 

First-year LSA student 

and East Quad resident Jun 
Pangilinan is taking part in the 
festivities. He said “I thought 
it’d be nice to watch the kids 
Trick-or-Treating since I’m 
no longer doing it myself.” His 
intentions are less than noble, 
however, as he added, “Besides, 
I get to keep the candy left-
overs.”

Music enthusiasts eagerly 

await the School of Music’s 
annual Halloween Concert 
tonight. The fun is slated to 
begin at 9 p.m. as the University 
Philharmonic Orchestra 

performs skits and ensembles 
before a sold-out audience at 
Hill Auditorium. Free tickets 
were distributed within two 
hours of availability weeks ago. 

“It should be really fun,” said 

School of Music sophomore 
Jennifer Fari Ansel. “Everyone, 
including some of the audience, 
comes dressed in costumes. 
Some of the sections are 
coming as a group. I’m excited 
to see the flutes in their ZZ Top 
skit.”

Yet, amidst the fun, the 

environmental concerns of 
the 1990’s are not forgotten. 
LSA senior Elizabeth Steel 
said “the weirdest costume at 
East Quad’s Halloween Thang 
would have to be the guy who 
came dressed in non-recyclable 
plastic.” 

It must have been a scary 

sight to behold.

FRIDAY’S BICENTENNIAL FEATURE: SPOOKY FESTIVITIES BREW TONIGHT
HALLOWEEN SERVES TO FRIGHTEN AND EXCITE

field sites primarily in Southeast 

Michigan help MSW students 
apply their knowledge learned in 
the classroom to a real position in 
their field of interest.

The U.S. Department of Labor’s 

Fair Labor Standards Act outlines 
six requirements an internship “in 
the ‘for-profit’ private sector” must 
meet for a position to be unpaid. 
According to these standards, the 
requirements include: internship 
positions reflect an educational 
environment, 
no 
immediate 

employer advantages from said 
internship work and the internship 
does not displace employees in 
favor of unpaid internship labor. 
Raycraft said the School of Social 
Work’s field education requirement 
meets these six points through the 
field education’s association with 
the University, structure around 
classroom 
learning, 
University 

oversight and credit allocation.

The program also requires 

agreements between the school, 
the company and the student to 
make sure the field education 

program stays in line with the U.S. 
standards for unpaid internships.

Raycraft said this field education 

requirement is different from an 
internship in that the programs 
MSW students are placed in reflect 
their educational interests, not the 
workforce needs of the employer 
sponsoring the position.

“An 
MSW 
student 
has 

an 
academic 
agreement 
and 

they’re created for each student 
individually,” Raycraft said. “It’s 
giving them the opportunity to 
apply their knowledge that they’re 
learning in classes and to gain 
practical skills, so it’s an extension 
of the classroom. It’s associated 
with academic programs, not with 
the employer … that’s the biggest 
distinction.”

Both the Fair Labor Standards 

Act and the Social Work School’s 
requirements for field placement 
positions 
reflect 
Raycraft’s 

statement that no field education 
position should take the place 
of regular, salaried employees. 
However, this is what Social Work 
student Erica Watson, School 
of Social Work Student Union 
vice president and Fair Labor 
Organizing 
is 
claiming 
often 

happens. Watson said though the 

learning contracts between the 
MSW student and the employer are 
sound from the beginning, often 
these field education positions 
morph into unpaid labor.

“We know that technically we 

are not supposed to be replacing 
regular employees and I think 
that when the School of Social 
Work goes to these placements to 
place us, that’s sort of the agreed 
upon thing but we hear again and 
again and again, from students, 
we’ve heard, ‘After I left my field 
placement, they hired somebody 
full-time with a health care 
package to do the exact same job 
as me’ or, ‘My supervisor was on 
maternal leave and I actually had 
to pick up all of her responsibilities 
while she was gone,’ ” Watson said.

To discuss methods of how the 

Social Work School can provide 
MSW students with more stipends 
and paid positions that satisfy 
the field education requirement, 
Watson and other MSW students 
created FLO. It became an official 
organization this past June and was 
recently made into a subcommittee 
of the School of Social Work 
Student Union. FLO’s survey was 
sent out over the summer on the 
School of Social Work listserv and 
from their responses to the survey, 
FLO has been working on the 
promotion of paid labor for MSW 
students.

Working a part-time job and 

being a student at the University 
of Michigan is not uncommon, 
with 52.5 percent of in-state 
students and 6.3 percent of out-of-
state students reporting they pay 
for everyday expenses like food 
with a student job, found a survey 
conducted 
by 
The 
Michigan 

Daily earlier this year. However, 
Watson said the program’s 912 
field placement hours requirement 
often results in students working 
unpaid positions, going to class 
and having to find outside jobs to 
pay for rent and food.

Watson cited the University’s 

Higher 
Education 
graduate 

program, whose required two-
term internship program most 
often includes a paid hourly 
stipend, as a branch of the 
University she believes from which 
the School of Social Work should 
draw inspiration. She said as the 
number-one-ranked social work

schools 
the 
Office 
of 

Undergraduate 
Admissions 

conducts, the University has spent 
“a significant amount” on digital 
advertising, Ishop said. This has 
come in the form of targeting 
underrepresented 
communities 

in the state via Twitter, Facebook 
and email — and she says it’s been 
effective so far. 

“We know that for emails 

we’ve sent to prospective in-state 
students, we’ve had a 43 percent 
open rate, 20 percent click rate 
on GBG content — those are good 
numbers,” she said. “43 and 20 
percent, those are good numbers 
considering how often students 
open their email.”

And despite ranking last in 

social mobility earlier this year, the 
University appears to have made 
progress in terms of increasing 
socioeconomic and racial diversity. 
The recently released summary of 
enrollment at the University shows 
an increase in the percentages of 
underrepresented minorities, first-
generation college students and 

students eligible for Pell Grants 
from the incoming freshman class 
of 2013 to the incoming class of 
2017. Since last year, however, the 
percentage of underrepresented 
minorities in the freshman class 
only increased 0.1 percent and the 
percentage of students eligible for 
Pell Grants decreased 1.4 percent.

Still, though, there are other 

factors 
hindering 
racial 
and 

socioeconomic diversity at the 
University left unaddressed by 
the guarantee. Even with tuition 
covered, the cost of living in Ann 
Arbor — which is high and getting 
higher — can be enough to deter 
students from coming.

Public Policy junior Drea Somers 

said she doesn’t fully understand 
the decision to not include housing 
costs in the guarantee.

“I think it would be wonderful 

if the Go Blue Guarantee at least 
included some kind of dorming 
or housing situation,” she said. 
“Especially if you don’t even live 
in the metro Detroit area, if you 
can’t afford tuition, why would 
you be able to afford housing in 
Ann Arbor? I always look at them 
like, ‘Well, why exclude it?’ And I 
understand that there are financial 
barriers, but it’s also still a barrier 
to those students’ education.”

Ishop pointed out that while 

the Go Blue Guarantee only 
concerns tuition, there’s still more 
financial aid potentially available 
to students struggling with living 
costs.

“We also put a great deal of 

resources, as you think about that 
zero to $65,000, that packaging, 
for many of those students is 
not only just for tuition, but a 
lot of those students would be 
receiving aid up to full cost of 
attendance or close to full cost of 
attendance,” she said. “Certainly 
we all understand that there are 
difficult choices that have to be 
made — they have to find housing 
and they’re living that life of 
having to adjust to somewhat of a 
wealthy community in Ann Arbor, 
but we’re certainly providing 
financial aid to be able to meet the 
demonstrated need at the cost of 
living for the University.”

But 
in 
addition 
to 
those 

additional 
financial 
barriers, 

being a new student and part of an 
underrepresented class at a large 
university can be intimidating. 
Graduating from a high school 
class of 30, Bennington said she 
experienced 
that 
disruption 

coming to college too, which was 
why she wanted to arrange the 

orientation for her students at the 
University.

“Going 
downstate 
to 
a 

university was culture shock, it 
was really scary,” she said. “And 
when we scheduled these kids 
for this tour, that’s what we were 
trying to get them acclimated to — 
the city life, and letting them get 
that exposure before just jumping 
into a semester as a freshman, 
where they’re more likely to drop 
out because they were just too 
overwhelmed.”

And it’s more than just culture 

shock, Nunn said — the University 
can often make underrepresented 
students 
feel 
invisible 
and 

unrecognized.

“The University of Michigan 

was founded on land given to 
it, in some ways, by the tribes 
of Michigan,” he said. “There’s 
no buildings named for native 
folks on campus — the C.C. Little 
debate about, ‘What do we rename 
C.C. Little?’ Well, we should 
probably recognize how we were 
founded in some ways. What 
does that say to native students, 
prospective native students about 
the University of Michigan? And I 
don’t think it says that we’re being 
inclusive — even if we’re trying 
to.”

“A U-M education is all about

First-generation 
students 
also 

make up 12.4 percent of the 
freshman class. A First Generation 
Student Gateway, replete with a 
study lounge, meeting area and 
information hub, opened earlier 
this month to serve the needs 
of this student population.

The 
guarantee 
and 

demographic increases come 
after a report by the Equality 
of Opportunity Project, which 
ranked 
the 
University 
last 

behind 
other 
prestigious 

public colleges in the category 
of social mobility. One in 100 

students 
at 
the 
University 

are from the top 1 percent of 
income distribution.

The out-of-state portion of 

the student body increased 
by 
1 
percent. 
Out-of-state 

students make up 49.3 percent 
of the student body, while 
in-state students comprise 50.6 
percent.

The University has shown 

increased enrollment over five 
years among underrepresented 
minorities, 
first-generation 

students 
and 
low-income 

students — but the total share 
of the student body only increased 
by 0.1 percent since last fall. 
Underrepresented 
minorities 

constitute 12.8 percent of the 
undergraduate student body, in 

comparison to 22.3 percent of the 
undergraduate student body at 
Michigan State University.

In a statement to the University 

Record, Kedra Ishop, vice provost 
for enrollment management, noted 
the gradual increase in minority 
student enrollment over the past 
five years. Out of 6,847 freshmen 
students 
arriving 
on 
campus 

this fall, 906 underrepresented 
minorities make up 13.9 percent 
of the class, an increase from 10.6 
percent in 2013.

Broken down by demographics, 

Black student enrollment in the 
class of 2022 decreased marginally; 
Hispanic enrollment increased 
by close to 1 percent; the Native 
population doubled to 0.17 percent 
of the class; and Asian enrollment 

dipped by 2.5 percent. 

However, 
Ishop 
further 

emphasized the importance of 
continuing to work toward greater 
diversity on campus.

“We continue to be committed 

to, while challenged by, achieving 
greater 
racial 
and 
ethnic 

diversity in our student body 
in 
our 
restrictive 
admissions 

environment,” she said.

Furthermore, the fall 2017 

freshmen class consists of 1,017 
students receiving federal Pell 
Grants — about 15.6 percent of 
the freshmen class, up from 14.5 
percent in the fall 2013 class.

Enrollment grew this fall with 

a 7.9 percent increase in applicants 
from the previous year and topping 
out at 59,886 received applications.

journalism fellows — along with 
the Communication Studies and 
English Language and Literature 
departments and the Ford School of 
Public Policy.

In 
a 
one-on-one 
interview 

with The Daily prior to the 
event, 
Fahrenthold 
highlighted 

the importance of speaking on 
the 
University’s 
campus 
— 
a 

traditionally 
liberal-leaning 

campus that voted primarily for 
democratic presidential candidate 
Hillary Clinton — about journalistic 
integrity 
and 
distinguishing 

between fake news and legitimate 
reporting.

TMD: I want to talk about this 

relevance to Ann Arbor and the 
idea of fake news and getting to the 
student base. We’re a traditionally 
liberal area and a majority of 
our students ended up voting for 
Hillary Clinton, so why is this issue 
so significant to this campus in 
particular?

Fahrenthold: 
I 
think 
it’s 

important for people to understand 
how do you cover news in the age of 
Trump. Just because people don’t 
like Trump doesn’t necessarily 
mean that they’re that informed 
about him. I’d rather have people 
— even people who like him and 
don’t like him — have them be 
informed about what he’s doing, 
what his administration is doing. 
Both because it’s better if we’re all 
informed but also because if you 

care about politics, you care about 
policy, just hating Donald Trump 
doesn’t really change anything and 
so you have to understand what’s 
going on within his administration 
to know where you might have an 
impact.

TMD: 
Coming 
from 
The 

Michigan Daily, we have a huge 
student journalist base here despite 
not having a journalism school, 
which is really interesting. What 
would some advice that you have 
for student journalists be regarding 
covering these types of things, 
especially in this pretty tumultuous 
climate?

Fahrenthold: I think that it’s 

important to get beyond … takes, this 
idea of analysis as journalism. There 
are some points when analysis is 
helpful, but I think in a lot of cases 
it’s easier than reporting and a lot 
of people fall back on it, especially 
when covering politics of any kind 
— campus politics, national politics 
— it’s easier to fall back on what you 
think is happening or when you’ve 
analyzed the situation rather than 
reporting what’s actually going on. 
I think especially in the modern 
news environment, with so many 
news sources, what readers want 
— not only what readers need but 
what readers want — is news, facts, 
a better understanding of what’s 
actually happening.

TMD: Do you have any tips on 

how to cover events — such as the 
ones we’ve seen on campus in terms 
of racist flyering or other incidents 
like that — in a way that ensures 
accuracy, speed in terms of breaking 
news, but also fair representation?

Fahrenthold: The really valuable 

service that newspapers provide 
in that situation is to explain more 
about — I think it’s hard for student 
journalists who live among other 
students, 
and 
because 
student 

journalists are so informed it’s hard 
to put yourself in the mindset of, 
what would my reader not know 
about this? What are the questions 
my reader would have?

For 
more 
of 
the 
exclusive 

interview with David Fahrenthold, 
watch our video interview. 

Lynette 
Clemetson, 
director 

of 
the 
Knight-Wallace 
House, 

introduced Fahrenthold to a full 
Mendelssohn Theatre, noting the 
significance of informing the public 
of news.

“Even though we work with 

journalists directly, we also take 
— as central to our mission — 
engaging in the public in journalism, 
demystifying the work of journalism 
and making sure people understand 
the vital role that journalism plays 
in our democracy and the absolute 
necessity 
of 
press 
freedom,” 

Clemetson 
said. 
“It’s 
a 
very 

important time to get young people 
engaged in journalism.”

During his talk, Fahrenthold — 

who has been at the Post for 17 years 
— discussed the challenges he faced 
throughout his career in political 
journalism.

“One of the true handicaps I have 

as a journalist is I’m an optimist. 
This is a huge handicap because it 
means things always sneak up on 
me,” Fahrenthold said. “In (the case 
of Trump), I was prepared for the 
answer.”

Fahrenthold 
discussed 
the 

lessons he learned while covering 

inconsistencies in Trump’s claims 
of philanthropy, including allowing 
the public to engage with open 
reporting, as he did via Twitter.

“Once 
you’ve 
taken 
your 

reporting as far as it can go under 
traditional methods as I had, the 
next step is open your reporting 
up,” Fahrenthold said. “Stretch 
your reporting as far as traditional 
reporting will let you.”

Throughout 
his 
experiences 

investigating the Donald J. Trump 
Foundation, Fahrenthold said he 
was able to learn how to create a 
thread for readers to follow — rather 
than making them responsible for 
knowing the context — particularly 
in changing expectations of news on 
social media. In a tumultuous time of 
reporting, Fahrenthold highlighted 
maintaining perspective.

“The one thing in all of this that 

I try to keep in mind is I try to adapt 
my reporting to the era of Trump,” 
Fahrenthold said. “The thing that 
I’ve tried to keep of all the time is 
the idea that we have to reject as 
journalists this image you get from 
Trump and Steve Bannon and other 
people, that we and the media and 
Donald Trump are at war with one 
another.”

He also described the significance 

of news media as speakers of truth 
and fact.

“The thing that gives us meaning 

and 
value 
is 
our 
credibility,” 

Fahrenthold said.

Following the talk, Fahrenthold 

took questions from the audience, 
which was comprised of students 
from the University and local high 
schools, faculty and community 
members. One question, submitted 

from Skyline High School students, 
asked about journalism as a career 
and journalism education.

“(Being a journalist) is a license 

to follow your curiosity and follow 
your outrage,” Fahrenthold said. 
“The most important education in 
journalism is to go out and do it.”

Others asked about Fahrenthold’s 

experience playing a role in the 
reveal of the Access Hollywood 
video. 
One 
of 
the 
challenges 

Fahrenthold faced was publishing 
the crude content heard in the video 
in a print publication. However, he 
said he didn’t write the story with 
malicious intent. The story has since 
become the Washington Post’s most 
read ever.

“I knew the story was going to 

be well-read and people were going 
to be interested in it,” Fahrenthold 
admitted. “I didn’t write it thinking, 
‘I’m going to take out Donald 
Trump.’ ”

Others questioned his methods 

regarding using Twitter to find 
sources.

“I have to verify it the way 

I would verify anything else,” 
Fahrenthold said. “You can’t give up 
the gatekeeper role.”

In terms of those who disregard 

news they don’t agree with as “fake,” 
Fahrenthold 
emphasized 
that 

evidence, finding underlying tactics 
to engage different types of viewers 
in the story and taking advantage of 
the skills a university can provide 
will prove valuable in ones career.

“It’s enormously damaging that 

we have a president and a party 
who is using the platform of the 
presidency to say that news he 
doesn’t like is fake,” Fahrenthold 

said. “Our role as journalists is to 
recognize that people that think 
that news is fake — we may have one 
chance to impress them. … We have 
to think of them as consumers and 
you have to do things in your stories 
and your broadcasts to show people 
why what you do is better and more 
trustworthy.”

After the event, LSA junior 

Megan Graham said she felt 
inspired after hearing about the 
work Fahrenthold did during the 
campaign.

“It was really encouraging to 

hear him talk about his work and all 
the important events that he’s been 
able — things about Trump and his 
campaign — that he’s able to talk 
about and bring to light,” Graham 
said. “I would have liked to hear 
more specific stories about how — 
specific things that he’s covered — 
because I thought that was really 
interesting and it brings everything 
back to the ground and how this 
affects our lives and our country as 
a whole.”

LSA senior Jason Rumsey said 

hearing Fahrenthold speak was 
an 
interesting 
opportunity 
to 

apply what he had learned in his 
communications classes at the 
University.

“I’m 
in 
the 
investigative 

journalism 
class, 
the 
written 

reporting class, and so coming to an 
event like this where you actually 
had to try to use some of the things 
that we’ve talked about not only in 
that class but also in other comm 
classes at the University (and) how 
he used those to get to a story was 
a quite interesting thing for me to 
hear,” Rumsey said.

graduate program in the country, 
paid stipends should be a higher 
priority.

“We 
know 
that, 
legally, 

(employers) do not have to pay 
us,” Watson said. “We think 
that that is a really low bar and 
that as the number one school of 
social work, we should be not just 
skirting the lowest bar by a hair 
but rather setting a standard for 
the field that we should be paying 
our interns because the work that 
they do produces value and is 
worth something other than our 
experiential learning.”

In July, FLO received over 550 

signatures from current MSW 
students, Social Work alumni 
and social workers currently in 
the field for a petition calling for 
fair compensation for their field 
experience requirement.

FLO is claiming the lack of paid 

positions for their field education 
work 
violates 
the 
National 

Association of Social Worker’s 
Code of Ethics, specifically the 
Code’s advocacy for basic living 
conditions and economic values 
found in Article 6 of the document.

The 
language 
differences 

between “internships” and “field 
education”, according to Raycraft, 
are 
crucial 
in 
understanding 

this division between students 
and administration. Since the 
field education positions count 
for credits in an MSW student’s 

semester, 
these 
positions 
are 

supposed to be completed in 
the time that students would 
be in another class without the 
required field work. In this case, 
Raycraft said MSW students are 
not completing internships and 
therefore are under different 
requirements 
that 
take 
into 

account academic credits when 
designing schedules for the benefit 
of the student.

“There is a very clear distinction 

between an internship and field 
education and the Council on 
Social Work Education regularly 
works with the Department of 
Labor Regulation to make sure 
social work field education is legal 
and aligned,” Raycraft said. “It’s 
very different than an internship 
… (field education) is about an 

academic experience for a student. 
It’s not about an employer’s actual 
operations.”

Raycraft also provided data 

obtained from the School of Social 
Work, which found that more 
than 85 percent of current MSW 
students receive some form of 
financial aid. The Social Work 
School also reports more than 
300 scholarships are available for 
MSW students.

Social 
Work 
student 
Kari 

Nilsen sees field education and 
internships in the same light and 
said even with financial aid, non-
paying positions that are required 
to graduate will leave students 
in very large debt crises after 
graduation.

“We are graduating with a lot 

of debt and then the available

positions that we have are ranging 
from $30,000 a year maybe up to 
$45,000 if you find a good paying job, 
so that discrepancy in debt and salary 
coming out of a master’s program is 
really, really difficult,” Nilsen said.

In the district court case O’Connor 

v. Davis, Bridget O’Connor, a social 
work major at Marymount College in 
New York, was required to complete 
200 hours of field work in her senior 
year. She was placed at Rockland, a 
mental hospital, for her field work 
position in 1994 and worked with Dr. 
James Davis under the supervision 
of Lisa Punzone, a supervisor at the 
hospital. O’Connor was continually 
sexually harassed by Davis, who 
called her “Miss Sexual Harassment” 
and constantly discussed sexual 
topics and made sexual jokes at 
O’Connor. O’Connor reported these 
actions to Punzone but Punzone 
did not tell her supervisor, James 
Wagner, about the sexual harassment 
allegations until January 1995, and 
Wagner also took no action.

O’Connor took her case to district 

court and accused Rockland and 
New York state of sexual harassment 
in violation of Title VII Employment 
Practices. 
The 
district 
court 

eventually sided with Rockland and 
New York state, claiming O’Connor 
was not within the boundaries of 
Title VII because she was not an 
employee, but rather completing a 
field work internship.

In 1997, the U.S. Court of Appeals 

affirmed the decision of the district 
court and set precedent for interns 
not being considered employees of 
the firm they are working with.

Social 
Work 
student 
Shelby 

Andersen-Holt said this court case 
takes rights from interns, who 

she says are often completing the 
same tasks as an employee, without 
having to pay them. She sees the 
Social Work School requirement as 
an internship program and said the 
number of available positions is being 
prioritized over asking existing field 
education positions to pay students 
for their work, despite the surface 
description of these positions as a 
purely educational experience.

“The Field Office is under this 

huge amount of pressure to find 
placements for students and a lot of 
times, what we’ve found and what 
we’ve heard from other students 
… the Field Office will prioritize 
maintaining 
relationships 
with 

placements over the well-being of 
the individual student because if they 
lose any of these placements, they 
are at risk of not being able to make 
it possible to meet the requirement,” 
Andersen-Holt said.

Raycraft 
said 
the 
positions 

aren’t inherently paid because 
they directly benefit the student’s 
education and not the employer’s 
workforce goals. She said these 
positions take credits out of a 
student’s course load so they 
act as a class and an educational 
experience, something one would 
never be paid for normally.

“There are internships where 

you go do it at an accounting 
firm and you’re there to support 
that accounting firm’s goals and 
objectives and to meet some of 
their objectives where ours (are) 
academically based,” Raycraft said. 
“It’s based on the student’s needs, 
not on the employer’s needs.”

I 
 

have very fond memories 
of sitting in the living 
room with my family, 

watching 
Bill 

O’Reilly 
on 
the 

television. 
It 

was 
part 
of 
my 

conservative, 
libertarian 
and 

Republican family’s 
routine. I quickly 
became 
interested 

in 
the 
political 

issues Bill O’Reilly 
talked about on his 
program and wanted 
to 
learn 
more, 

believing 
the 
information 

I’d find would affirm the 
conservative viewpoints that 
surrounded me.

The 
exact 
opposite 

occurred. After researching 
various 
issues 
by 
reading 

countless sources, I realized 
that my viewpoints aligned 
with those of mainstream 
liberals 
rather 
than 
the 

conservatives I had previously 
thought were correct.

I soon became a liberal 

in 
a 
conservative 
family. 

In 
the 
inevitable 
political 

conversations I had with my 
family, I had to defend the 
liberal 
views 
I 
eventually 

developed. This was difficult. 
At first, it was hard for me to 
deal with some of the views 
my family held. I felt that some 
conservative viewpoints, like 
the Republican Party’s pro-life 
stance, were offensive to me as 
a woman. At the same time, my 
family found some of my liberal 
viewpoints, 
like 
increasing 

social welfare programs, to be 
fiscally irresponsible.

However, my family and I 

were quickly able to reconcile 
our political views with our 
love for each other. This was 
possible through conversation, 
which required me to evaluate 
my viewpoints thoroughly. In 
fact, I’m grateful that I grew 
up the way I did, because it 
forced me to constantly defend 
my values. Now, as a college 
student in a divisive political 
climate, I can defend my views 
more effectively.

Here at the University of 

Michigan, I have been doing 
my best to have this same 
understanding with those I 
disagree with. While there 

are some views that I just 
cannot tolerate — including 
white 
supremacist 
views, 

homophobic 
or 

sexist 
rhetoric 
or 

any other type of 
hate speech — I try 
to 
keep 
an 
open 

mind when it comes 
to 
Republican 

or 
conservative 

viewpoints. 
My 

experience 
as 
a 

political 
minority 

in my family has 
helped me become 
more perceptive to 

opposing viewpoints.

Political 
ideologies 
are 

often developed as a result 
of a combination of research 
and personal experience. My 
identities 
and 
experiences 

have largely influenced my 
political views. This is also 
true for those whose identities 
and experiences shaped their 
conservative ideology. Their 
experiences are their own, 
and as a result, I cannot tell 
them 
what 
political 
views 

they should hold. This is why 
acceptance of a variety of 
viewpoints is necessary. Each 
person has their own identities 
and experiences that influence 
their ideology, and it is important 
to validate those factors.

Mutual 
respect 
was 

a 
big 
factor 
in 
creating 

understanding 
between 
my 

family and myself. I knew that 
my family members did not 
hold their more conservative 
viewpoints for any sort of 
malicious reason; they did not 
want to destroy the country 
or offend people. They simply 
believed that their ideology 
was the best route for the 
United States. I had to explain 
why I thought that liberal 
policies were better for the 
nation. These conversations 
created the mutual respect that 
was key in generating healthy 
relationships.

My 
family 
and 
I 
have 

realized 
that 
both 
of 
our 

divergent ideologies have valid 
points, which has increased 
mutual respect. My family 
respected the effort I had put 
into 
researching 
different 

issues. This type of validation 
helped me respect the beliefs 
my family held. After years 

of not entirely understanding 
the views my family holds, I 
realize that their views are just 
as thought-out as mine. As a 
liberal who prides herself on 
being open-minded, I refuse 
to 
invalidate 
the 
thought 

my loved ones put into their 
political views, and I find it 
necessary to keep that lesson in 
mind when dealing with others 
who hold viewpoints that I may 
find problematic.

This is not to say I never 

make assumptions about a 
person based on their political 
views. I do. However, I try 
my best to get past these 
assumptions. I strongly believe 
that 
we 
should 
welcome 

a 
multitude 
of 
opinions. 

Debating different aspects of 
an issue is the best way to solve 
a political problem.

I am blessed with a really 

loving family. I could not 
ask for anything better as 
my family supports me in 
my pursuits every day. I also 
know that my family loves 
me because of, not in spite 
of, my passion for my views. 
Though I realize it is much 
easier to respect the views 
your own family holds, it is 
possible to embrace ideological 
differences and conversation is 
necessary. I truly believe that 
diversity of opinion is what 
makes the U.S. a great country. 
The University should be a 
safe place for everyone who 
goes here. Doing our best to 
understand those we do not 
agree with is an important step 
in this pursuit.

I 

remember 
being 
very 

young and so incredibly 
proud of the fact that I was 

a girl. I refused to watch movies 
with a male lead as I insisted 
that they were always boring, 
and I’m sure I had an army of 
T-shirts and stickers that said 
“girls rule and boys drool.” 
Whenever any boy in my class 
teased anyone for being a girl, 
I was sure to stand up for them 
and state what my father had 
always insisted I remember: A 
girl can do anything a boy can do. 
Though my conception of gender 
has changed since my preschool 
days, 
my 
femininity, 
my 

sensitivity and my inclination for 
cooperation and understanding 
are still the traits I value the 
most about myself.

Unfortunately, another part 

of me that hasn’t changed since 
preschool is a general fear and 
wariness of cisgender men. 
When I was younger, this meant 
I would feel more comfortable 
with a female teacher, a female 
doctor and female friends. 
Nowadays, this means I’m more 
likely to sit next to someone 
in class who I perceive to be 
female-presenting, and more 
likely to avoid someone I 
perceive to be male.

This 
doesn’t 
mean 
that 

I don’t have any male or 
masculine friends whom I 
trust 
and 
appreciate, 
but 

this does mean that my gut 
instinct is to stick to female-
presenting folks. Many could 
perceive a general distrust 
of maleness as a form of 
misandry, a hatred of cis men 
for simply being cis men. But 
I truly don’t believe that this 
distrust was formed out of an 
attachment to feminist ideals, 
but 
instead 
as 
ingrained 

lessons I learned throughout 
my childhood.

The lessons to which I am 

referring are the times my dad 
would tell my sister and me 

that “men are idiots” and “boys 
are only after one thing.” It 
became a joke in our family; my 
dad would turn to my sister or 
me and say, “What are boys?” 
We would respond, “idiots,” 
and he would nod his head in 
satisfaction. The fact that the 
man who was most important 
to me during my childhood 
insisted I remember not to 
trust boys inherently affected 
my worldview.

I also am referring to the 

times my mom would tell me 
not to walk home late at night 
because, “You’re a pretty girl, 
we don’t want boys getting any 
ideas.” Lastly, I am referring 
to the many times my sister 
and I were told to lock the 
bathroom door and not walk 
around in our bathing suits if 
there were other men in the 
house. Women, on the other 
hand, were always completely 
trusted and a strange woman 
visiting my house heeded no 
warning to my sister and me. I 
began to understand that those 
who were female-presenting 
could be trusted, but that men 
and maleness, though to be 
respected, was also something 
I needed to remain wary of. 

As I became older, I began 

to fall back on this feeling of 
distrust more and more often. 
I became numb to catcalls, and 
at night, I would instinctively 
lower my head and avoid eye 
contact 
when 
walking 
by 

someone who appeared male. 
Over and over I would hear 
my female-presenting friends 
talk about how they had been 
mistreated by random dudes at 
the bar or the club. I would feel 
the need to be more assertive 
and aggressive when taking 
classes that were majority 
male, or else my voice would be 
stomped out.

I 
received 
inappropriate 

messages from strange men 
on 
Facebook, 
Tinder 
and, 

most surprisingly, LinkedIn. 
I 
still 
get 
nervous 
when 

opening 
messages 
online. 

When 
I 
reported 
a 
male 

educator for behavior I deemed 
inappropriate, it was because 
I didn’t trust him and felt my 
privacy violated. Thus was life, 
and distrust and cynicism was 
how I managed to get through 
it all.

Though I feel bad that I have 

an internalized distrust or 
wariness towards strange men, 
I am not yet willing to apologize 

for it. This past month men 
and women, inspired by the 
women who came forward to 
denounce Harvey Weinstein, 
shared the hashtag #MeToo 
in order to display the breadth 
and 
magnitude 
of 
sexual 

misconduct in our society. As 
many articles have pointed 
out, Weinstein would not have 
gotten away with his crimes 
for as long as he had without 
the help of many others, as well 
as a workplace culture that 
minimized sexual harassment 
and shamed survivors.

So, 
though 
I 
do 
feel 

somewhat 
guilty 
for 
my 

inherent biases, I refuse to 
feel the need to apologize or 
feel guilty for them when so 
many cisgender men will rarely 
recognize or call out sexism 
or 
inappropriate 
behavior 

in everyday situations (for 
example, Quentin Tarantino). 
If cisgender men truly want 
to see the system change, 
they need to begin to stand up 
against sexism in obvious and 
uncomfortable ways.

As 
a 
white 
woman, 
I 

understand how awkward it 
can be to call out friends and 
family for their inappropriate 
behavior, but I understand that 
if I don’t call out racism, then 
I am complicit in a system of 
white supremacy. Cisgender 
men need to realize that if they 
don’t start working to change 
this dialogue around sexual 
assault, then they are actively 
promoting their supremacy in 
a patriarchal system. If they 
want to see a world where they 
are not inherently distrusted 
by female-presenting people, 
then they need to realize that 
they play an integral role in 
creating it.

 Editor’s note: The writer’s last

identity.
T

he drinking and the 
costume 
definitely 

made 
IT 
easier 
for 

them. But IT shouldn’t have 
even happened. I was not a 
target, I was the bullseye. 
Unknowingly in the center of 
a malicious plan. My vision 
was clouded and my dexterity 
was 
diminished. 
As 
my 

strength deteriorated, so did 
my judgment. I like to dance, 
but why did I venture so far 
that night? I trusted a stranger 
to bring me home safely on an 
unfamiliar campus. 

Mistake. Mistake.
Like an idiot, there was no 

alarm going off in my head. The 
liquor had transformed me. No 
alarm, until I was pulled in a room 
by the arms of multiple men.

For days after the assault I 

laid in bed unmoving, other 
than the tears rolling down my 
cheeks.

Do you know what emotions 

canter through your body? How 
self-blame is inevitable, and how 
self-worth shatters in your face? 
Your former character is exiled 
from fear. Your previous being 
is dethroned. In the following 
months, there were two monsters 
that controlled my thoughts.

The first was an ebony cave, 

with an absence of light. It 
induced hibernation and no 
appetite. My ambition became 
limited, yet my idleness ran 
rampant. It acted as an empty 
cavern for my anxiety to reside. 
The walls were reverberators 
for the echo of its breath. Slow 
and unsteady, like the beating 
of my chest. Ready to cease, yet 

relentlessly unfailing. Agony: 
He would gawk at me.

The second was a sharp high, 

with that full-body absentee. 
It forged enhanced sensations 
and hyperreality. My awareness 
was active, but my response 
was impaired. It operated as an 
induced insanity. Emotions free 
of gravity. Active when they 
wanted, and not when I needed. 
Attendance in rhythmic motion 
with my most inconvenient 
moments. Panic: She would 
take over me.

They entered me without 

my 
permission. 
All 
the 

perpetrators 
and 
prevailing 

emotions. 
Physically 
and 

mentally. It dismantled me 
inside, then out.

BLEECKER STREET

King Krule sinks further 
into ‘The OOZ’ with style

London 
is 
a 
melting 

pot, sure, but Peckham is 
something else. There are 
Nigerian 
fashion 
retailers 

mixed with Jamaican chicken 
shacks; down the road there 
are cult-like gatherings where 
British 
youth 
reminisce 

about the days 
before 
CCTV 

monitored 
the 

top 
deck 
of 

buses. 
It’s 
a 

bizarre 
place, 

and 
a 
fitting 

home for Archy 
Marshall — a scraggly white 
kid with red hair, who cites J 
Dilla and Fela Kuti with equal 
reverence. 

Archy’s 
broad 
range 

of 
influences 
lends 
itself 

naturally 
to 
his 
scattered 

musical identity. His most 
acclaimed work is as King 
Krule, the enigmatic guitarist 
we haven’t seen since 2013, but 
he’s also Edgar The Beatmaker 
(Soundcloud producer), DJ JD 
Sports (Macbook rapper), Zoo 
Kid (depressed high schooler) 
and of course Archy Marshall 
(so far, a lo-fi cloud rapper).

His latest effort as King 

Krule, The OOZ, is largely 
characterized by the radio 
silence 
that 
preceded 
it. 

Since we’ve last seen him, 
he’s aged, fallen in and out of 
love, rapped with rappers and 
smoked in his ever-changing 
native Peckham. On “A Slide 
(In New Drugs)” he quips 
“The cityscape, bourgeoisie 
change to replicate / How can 
I be feeling the same as you?”

It’s been four years, but 

he’s by and large the same 
as he once was. Where on 6 
Feet Beneath The Moon Archy 
would yell at the sky, The OOZ 
sees him kick rocks through 
a cloud of smoke. While the 
years have certainly eroded 
the more explosive musical 
tendencies 
of 
his 
youth, 

the album features some of 
his 
clearest 
and 
sharpest 

songwriting to date.

At 17 he already had the 

perspective 
of 
a 
twice-

divorced man, but now at 
23, the pool of experience 
he draws from has grown 
even more burdensome. The 
album is his best attempt 
at letting it out, or perhaps 
letting us in, and while it’s not 
exactly a “happy place,” the 
incessant “ooz” of day-to-day 
life presents a challenge you 
simply learn to get on with.

On album-opener “Biscuit 

Town,” 
he 

rhymes 
“Gianfranco 
Zola” 
with 
“I 

think she thinks 
I’m 
bipolar”; 

his 
thoughts 

dart 
through 

his South London upbringing 
on 
inhale 
and 
move 
to 

relationships on exhale.

At times it’s hard to tell if his 

intense ruminations are really 
just melodramatic grouses. On 
“Vidual” he grumbles “I put 
my trust in many things but 
now I know that’s dumb / So 
I don’t trust anyone, only get 
along with some / Saw that 
girl again one time and now I 
know it’s done”. It’s all just a 
bit passé for a 23 year old.

There are a lot of these soft 

murmurs on this album, but 
for the first time, there’s some 
absolute belting too, as we’d 
seen earlier this year on Mount 
Kimbie’s “Blue Train Lines.” At 
first pass it’s difficult to make 
sense of him screaming “I wish 
I was people!” on “Locomotive,” 
but honestly, when shit goes 
pear-shaped, wouldn’t you love 
to be “people,” too? Other brash 
instances, like his “Half man 
with a body of a shark” chant 
(16 times over), are slightly more 
bewildering.

Archy front-loads most of the 

album’s flashpoints, like a guitar 
solo on “Dum Surfer” that 
sounds like you’re hearing it for 
the first time, every time. Later 
in the song he conjures imagery 
of him puking on the sidewalk 
before getting in a cab with a 
Slovakian girl.

Though “Dum Surfer” is his 

only “night out” on the album, 
most of the songs take place on 
nights where the darkness just 
swallows him whole. It’s less 
lad culture debauchery and 

more anxious rambling about 
relationships, family and self-
doubt.

“Logos” for example, would 

not have been so out of place 
on 
Frank 
Ocean’s 
Endless 

(it’s similar in that way to his 
fantastic EP, A New Place 2 
Drown). “I call my mum / She 
stumbles home / Through open 
ground / Back to broken homes” 
sounds like it’s being recited 
while sinking into his couch. 
Sonically, the song deviates 
from his traditional synth and 
guitar 
composition, 
adding 

elements of jazz he’s cited but 
never quite recreated until now.

That sinking feeling never 

leaves The OOZ, and the only 
thing that oscillates over the 
course of the album is his 
willingness to reach for others. 
Much of the album is about 
finding out if what you need is 
time alone or more time with 
someone else.

The drunk keys of “Czech 

One” bring with them the 
centerpiece of the album — a 
woozy song of lust, isolation and 
directionless passing of time. 
“She asked me why I’m here / 
But I come here every night / Do 
you need to tell her something? 
/ No, I need a place to write”. 
In one verse, he “drown[s] too 
quick,” “fade[s] out of sight” 
and yet, “he still search[es] for 
warmth.”

In 
the 
music 
video, 
for 

a 
moment, 
he 
actually 

levitates over the pavement of 
Bermondsey; in a way, that’s 
what he’s been doing for the 
past five years. He’s always 
been floating in the middle, 
somewhere in-between. He’s 
five aliases at once. He’s “half 
man half shark,” half where he 
wants to be and half crumbling, 
physically present but mentally 
disintegrating.

The OOZ makes you question 

if it’s even worth getting up. 
It obscures what you think 
you know, because sometimes 
those downward spirals are 
just harsh realities you’d rather 
not believe. Sometimes it isn’t 
too bad to be true though — 
it’s just plain true. The OOZ is 
what lures you further into the 
couch. Sometimes that’s just 
where you need to be.

Bleak stories about rich White 

people with too much time on 
their hands can only do so much. 
Personally, 
my 
tolerance 
for 

watching wealthy has-beens and 
artists lament about life — mind 
you, while sitting in a multi million-
dollar brownstone — is shrinking 
every day. There’s a plethora of other 
stories waiting to be told, those that 
show a more realistic depiction of 
the everyday lives of Americans. 

And yet, Noah Baumbach (“The 

Meyerowitz 
Stories”) 
chooses 

to rewrite the same movie about 
wealthy, dysfunctional, New York 
families led by an insufferable, 
arrogant patriarch who gets joy 
from dismissing “A Tale of Two 
Cities” as a “minor work” and 
brainwashing his kids into being 
clones. “The Squid and the Whale,” 
released 12 years ago, fulfills his 
prerequisites: 
A 
once-famous 

author struggles through a divorce 
as his teenage children suffer the 
consequences of family turmoil 
and his selfish behavior. The movie, 
with sharp dialogue and developed 
younger characters, is the director’s 
crowning achievement.

This year, Baumbach wrote and 

directed “The Meyerowitz Stories,” 
a replication of “The Squid and 
the Whale” except starring adults 
instead of teenagers as the damaged 
children of a has-been egotist. 
Like its predecessor, it’s a terrific 
depiction of a shattered family 
and doesn’t veer into melodrama 
territory. But he has essentially told 
this story before, except better. And 
at this point, we really don’t need 

more of the same.

I 
don’t 
blame 
Baumbach, 

a director I admire, for my 
intolerance for these movies –– it’s 
systemic. Hollywood constantly 
looks beyond stories about regular 
folk, especially in flyover country, 
in favor of ritzier, more glamorous 
stories with attractive people. How 
can two versions of “Squid and 
the Whale” be made and yet there 
are few movies about ordinary, 
unglamorous Midwesterners living 
in a blue-collar suburb?

“Logan Lucky,” a favorite from 

this year, was a feat for representing 
working-class 
Americans. 

With 
knockout 
performances 

from Channing Tatum (“Magic 
Mike XXL”) and Adam Driver 
(“Paterson”), we grew to love the 
characters, and not in an ironic, 
mocking way. The movie showed 
a completely different world than 
California or New York City. Some 
criticized the movie for depicting 
the characters like some sort of 
freak show, or a circus for elites to 
gather around to point and laugh at 
the oh-so unsophisticated “hillbilly” 
class. But the Logan family isn’t so 
different: They have dreams and 
feel pain like everyone else, it’s just 
that their goals consist of robbing a 
NASCAR track.

Horror movies tend to represent 

regular people, but more as a 
tactic to cause lingering fright. If a 
typical suburban family is haunted 
by a ghost, the prospect of other 
families getting haunted grows, 
making the movie even scarier. If 
elites in Beverly Hills are haunted, 
it seems a lot less believable and 
more forgettable in the long run. 
Horror movies are only relatable if 
the people in them are too. Thanks 

to this scheme, the walk from my 
car to my front door at night in my 
quaint Detroit suburb is usually 
a dead sprint filled with fears of 
ghouls and goblins ready to pounce 
from the trees. Probably unlikely, 
but definitely spooky nonetheless.

In a divided political climate, 

Hollywood 
is 
deepening 
the 

separation between classes. It 
sometimes feels more like an “us 
vs them” scenario than something 
all Americans can share together. 
Television has a better track record, 
with ABC sitcoms leading the way at 
depicting a diverse array of families, 
but there are still shows like HBO’s 
recently concluded “Girls” that 
show trust fund babies in Brooklyn 
with ample free time and little 
relatability for most Americans. 
And even my favorite, “Master 
of None,” one of today’s sincerest 
and funniest shows, falls into this 
trap: Dev, the main character (Aziz 
Ansari, “Parks and Recreation”), 
spends a lot of his time eating and 
drinking at the finest New York 
establishments, something a Texan 
or Iowan probably can’t relate to.

But once again, Lena Dunham 

(“Girls”) and Aziz Ansari aren’t to 
blame; their shows are well-written 
and portray contemporary New 
Yorkers with honesty. It’s that for 
every 10 movies or television shows 
like this, there’s only one “Logan 
Lucky.” Baumbach deserves to be 
able to retell the “Squid and the 
Whale” ’s story to his liking, but we 
need to see more movies about lower-
income families on the marquee, as 
well. Hollywood isn’t doing its part 
to counter the destructive, growing 
divide in America today; it’s time to 
show regular Americans and their 
struggles.

The great unifier — or 
divider: Facebook in ‘17

I was 13 when I first made 

my Facebook account. I was so 
young I had to say that I was 19 
just so I could make an account. 
But my little white lie quickly 
paid off. Scrolling through 
my 
sister’s 
and 
brother’s 

Facebooks, I was mesmerized 
by the social network’s vivid, 
true-blue aesthetic and the 
concept of a “wall” for my 
friends to use. I felt like I’d just 
discovered fire.

At the time, Facebook was 

largely 
reserved 
for 
high-

schoolers and college students, 
so you can understand my 
excitement 
in 
joining 
this 

exclusive club. Simply having 
a Facebook made me believe 
I was ten times cooler than 
I’d ever been. I immediately 
devoted 
the 
rest 
of 
that 

cloudless August afternoon to 
designing my profile. Surely, I 
thought, everyone would want 
to know about my love of the 
Boston Red Sox, or how skilled 
of a Halo 3 player I was. After 
all, wasn’t that what Facebook 
was for — to share your 
personal life online?

While Facebook continues 

to satisfy this overarching goal 
today, the social network has 
shifted its focus to become 
much more than a platform 
to present oneself. Facebook 
has become a marketplace. 
Facebook has become a rolodex. 
Facebook has become a news 
source. And it’s done it all right 
before our eyes.

One of Facebook’s latest and 

most interesting features is its 
marketplace. 
Introduced 
in 

October of 2016, the Facebook 
Marketplace allows the social 
network’s users to buy and 
sell items with other users in 
their immediate area, similar 
to popular apps like OfferUp and 
letgo. The introduction of this 
secondary market provides an 
outlet for users to sell or acquire 
items for which they otherwise 
wouldn’t receive any sort of 
compensation, and it’s one of 
the social network’s strongest 
new additions.

Beyond 
its 
official 

marketplace, 
Facebook 

has a number of unofficial 
marketplaces 
among 
its 

user 
groups. 
Every 
week, 

my Facebook feed is flooded 
with 
friends, 
or 
friends 

of friends, posting in the 
“University of Michigan Class 
of 2019” Facebook group to sell 
anything from concert tickets 
to coffee tables. At least among 
my friends, this is where the 
real business of buying and 
selling is done, since users on 
these informal marketplaces 
often 
have 
mutual 
friends 

with other members of the 
group. Not only does this make 
buying and selling safer, but 
it also makes it more personal 
because both users understand 
that they’re transacting with a 
real person that their friends 
likely know.

Personally, I’ve found these 

unofficial marketplaces to be 
excellent — only last week I 
sold one of my football tickets 
to a friend’s sorority sister 
in just a few hours and our 
conversation ended up as a 
debate over how much we 

liked the Yeezy clothing line. 
However, it’s also important 
to recognize that Facebook 
isn’t the most ideal site for 
users (see: 2016 presidential 
election), so the social network 
may ultimately have to modify 
its market features to avoid the 
fate of Craigslist, which has 
developed a seedy reputation 
due 
to 
“Craigslist 
Killer” 

Philip Markoff.

Along 
with 
assuming 

the role of a local market, 
Facebook 
has 
become 
an 

online rolodex. With more 
than 2 billion active users each 
month, it seems like everyone 
has a Facebook account. It’s 
rare today to search a person’s 
name on Facebook and come 
up empty — from children 
to 
great 
grandparents, 

every demographic is using 
Facebook. While other social 
networking sites like Twitter 
and Instagram boast similarly 
massive user bases, they don’t 
come close to matching the 
ubiquity of Facebook accounts.

To me, the fact that I can 

find nearly everyone I know 
on Facebook is incredible. It 
means that I can meet a person 
and immediately connect with 
them on the social network. 
I can even message them, 
or anyone for that matter — 
a feature which, critically, 
Twitter and Instagram lack 
— on these sites only already-
connected users can directly 
communicate 
with 
each 

other. This is one of the least-
discussed, yet most beneficial, 
aspects of Facebook. When 
my friend’s phone died and 
we became separated at a 
concert this past month, I 
relied on Facebook to message 
my friend’s friend to find 
them. Without Facebook, I 
would have had no means of 
communicating with either of 
them.

The other piece of Facebook’s 

rolodex involves all of the 
pictures, ideas and personal 
information it maintains for 
each user. While users may 
post some of their pictures, 
for example, on Instagram, 
they typically post all of them 
on Facebook, which has made 
the site into a repository 
for personal data. Although 
having to go to just one site to 
find all of a person’s digital life 
is convenient, I have serious 
misgivings about the misuse 
of this personal information. 
As we saw during the now-
infamous 
2016 
presidential 

election, 
Facebook’s 
troves 

of data can be exploited by 
shady 
entities 
to 
further 

their nefarious goals. Using 
Facebook’s data, these firms 
develop marketing strategies 
that play up to users’ fears or 
desires and manipulate those 
sentiments.

Along 
with 
transforming 

into 
a 
digital 
rolodex, 

Facebook has become a news 
source for its users. Through 
its 
“Trending” 
section 

on each user’s news feed, 
Facebook 
presents 
relevant 

news 
headlines, 
complete 

with links to full stories on 
news platforms. Due to its 
prominent placement at the top 
right of each user’s news feed, 
it’s difficult for users to avoid 
reading 
Facebook-generated 

taglines for news stories. This 

location is a clear attempt by 
Facebook to promote its brand 
of news among its users and 
convince them to drop more 
traditional news sites in favor 
of 
Facebook’s 
aggregated 

stories.

Frankly, 
this 
section 
of 

the social network is highly 
concerning to me. Having such 
a mysterious and omnipotent 
corporation such as Facebook 
controlling 
news 
headlines 

that are seen by billions of users 
is downright terrifying to me. 
I hate returning to the same 
example, but, as we saw during 
the 2016 presidential election, 
the language and placement 
of news headlines can have a 
substantial impact on users’ 
interpretation of the news 
and their level of trust of the 
media. Considering Facebook 
has such low barriers to entry 
for its advertisers, who’s to 
say that that lack of a strong 
verification process doesn’t 
carry over to its news sources? 
My fears appear especially 
apt given that Facebook has 
been 
“slow 
to 
cooperate” 

with ongoing Congressional 
investigations 
into 
Russian 

efforts to influence the 2016 
election.

Similar to its marketplace, 

Facebook has a more unofficial 
version of its news section, 
which comes in the form 
of users’ news stories and 
articles. Using a “share” tool, 
users can post news stories to 
each of their friends’ individual 
news feeds. While the intent 
of this feature is obvious — 
to promote users’ stories to 
their friends — it is seldom 
used purely for this purpose. 
Rather than simply inform, 
these “shared” stories, in my 
experience, 
usually 
create 

heated debates among users. As 
I’ve observed, users, especially 
recently, often promote biased 
or partisan news sources with 
headlines 
corresponding 
to 

their 
ideology. 
The 
result 

is news feeds clogged with 
controversial 
(even 
fake) 

news stories containing tense 
comment sections that can 
quickly 
become 
incredibly 

aggressive.

While not as troubling as 

Facebook’s aggregated news, 
these “shared” news stories 
remain somewhat distressing. 
Users only “share” the stories 
that 
truly 
resonate 
with 

them, and this endorsement 
frequently 
divides 
users 
on 

critical issues. Personally, my news 
feed is often inundated with news 
stories “shared” by my friends 
about President Trump, which 
regularly 
leads 
to 
aggressive 

debates and, sometimes, even 
derogatory comments and hateful 
allegations. While this is partially 
a result of the hyperpolarized 
political climate prevailing lately, 
Facebook is enabling many of 
these tense arguments by allowing 
users to parade the news stories 
they support on other users’ 
digital spaces.

As concerning as Facebook’s 

news platform is, I don’t see the 
$500 billion corporation scaling 
back any of these new features 
anytime soon. That’s why it’s 
on us, now, to overcome these 
challenges, to preach civility 
over conflict and to not allow a 
social network to divide us as a 
nation, and as humans.

NEW MEDIA NOTEBOOK

The 
important 
form 
of 

documentary 
today 
never 

airs in theaters. We view it 
in grainy windows on social 
media, on shady video sites 
that 
don’t 
regulate 
their 

content. Sometimes, we see 
edited versions on the evening 
news, or sandwiched between 
paragraphs on our favorite 
news site.

The 
footage 
that 
has 

exposed the deadly use of 
police violence against Black 
men in the United States is a 
phenomenon of immeasurable 
sociopolitical import, and our 
culture has yet to correct itself 
even an inch in combatting the 
evils that this documentary 
has brought to forefront of 
discourse.

I 
have 
been 
drastically 

disappointed 
by 
recent 

attempts by mainstream art 
to capture the horror of these 
videos. 
Kathryn 
Bigelow’s 

controversial 
“Detroit” 
is 

the latest in this string of 
disappointments, a work of 
historical fiction that attempts 
to 
retroactively 
document 

a 
past 
injustice, 
one 
that 

happened before smartphones 
could have shone their light on 
it. It failed because it played the 
events as a traditional thriller. 
“Detroit” ’s inoffensive but banal 
formal structure betrayed the 
gravity of the horrific racial 
murders that made up its 
subject. Real violence became 
pop movie violence.

I 
became 
even 
more 

disappointed 
by 
“Detroit” 

when I realized that decades 
earlier, Bigelow had already 
tackled this subject with a 
narrative film, and not only 
was this film astoundingly 
more successful in capturing 

the 
horror 
of 
documented 

police violence, but it also made 
key predictions about the role 
of technology in uncovering 
injustice that were terrifyingly 
prescient. 
“Strange 
Days,” 

Kathryn 
Bigelow’s 
1995 

secret 
neo-noir 
cyberpunk 

masterpiece, not only does 
this, but offers a message of 
hope and change in the face 
of the crushing hegemony of 
neoliberal white supremacy.

Initially, 
“Strange 
Days” 

seems like a forgettable but 
good pastiche of noir genre 
elements in a cyberpunk future. 
You’ve got your noir antihero: 
A 
disgraced, 
slimy 
former 

detective who hangs onto his 
principles by a thread (Ralph 
Fiennes, “The Grand Budapest 
Hotel”), 
his 
trusty, 
badass 

partner who grounds the film 
in morality (Angela Bassett, 
“American Horror Story”) a 
mysterious macguffin, a sex 
worker caught in a deadly bit 
of trouble, a femme fatale and 
of course, thugs who protect 
the interests of their evil 
employers 
with 
violence. 

Where 
“Strange 
Days” 

becomes 
something 
more 

than “Chinatown but in the 
future, man” is when the secret 
our antihero stumbles on is 
a recording of an execution-
style murder of a Black activist 
by the LAPD. Bigelow made 
the film in the aftermath of 
Rodney King, the white-hot 
rage of racial injustice becomes 
imbued as the driving force of 
the plot.

Bigelow’s first stroke of 

genius was in recognizing and 
portraying the fundamental 
flaws in our society that lead 
to racial violence and injustice. 
The world of “Strange Days” is 
a very near future that’s only 
slightly more grimy, alienated 
and violent than reality. Her 
extraordinary 
set 
designers 

and artists painted the perfect 
geohell, a Verhoevian late-
capitalist Los Angeles where 
desperate masses clash with a 
fascist police force as capital-
owning aristocrats cavort in 
skyscrapers. 
The 
key 
here 

is that the inequality is only 
slightly exaggerated, unlike 
in films like “Elysium” when 
the 
class 
metaphor 
is 
so 

cartoonish and over-the-top 
that the connection to reality 
is lost. I suppose “Strange 
Days” shares some formal DNA 
with “Blade Runner,” another 
sci-fi neo-noir where themes 
of exploitation and slavery 
are 
central, 
but 
“Strange 

Days” fearlessly confronts the 
issue of racial social justice 
where the “Blade Runner” 
films pull punches. Where 
“Blade Runner” attempts to 
ground the audience’s pathos 
for injustice in applying the 
consequences 
of 
slavery 

and violence to exclusively 
White 
characters, 
“Strange 

Days” directly confronts the 
repressive violence against the 
Black working class.

Bigelow’s 
second 
stroke 

of genius was her casting 
of the two main characters. 
Casting the brilliant Ralph 
Fiennes, whose star-making 
roles the previous two years 
in “Schindler’s List” (as a 
Nazi) and “Quiz Show” (as 
a 
charismatic, 
handsome 

Protestant groomed to replace 
an 
unphotogenic 
Jew 
on 

television) established him as 
a symbol of clean-cut WASPs 
in positions of immense power. 
It is deliciously subversive 
for Bigelow to cast him as a 
self-serving white guy who 
changes when he discovers the 
horrific injustices perpetuated 
against minorities in America. 
Angela Bassett’s casting, hot 
off of Spike Lee’s “Malcolm 
X,” was equally brilliant, as 
her character is not merely a 
strong and fierce badass, but a 
powerful, sympathetic moral 
voice that goes beyond acting 
as Fiennes’s sidekick and acts 
as the catalyst for enacting 
racial justice.

And finally, like all great 

sci-fi filmmakers, Bigelow uses 
ideas about future technology 
to make moral statements 
about society. The “wire,” a 
Google Glass-like device that 
allows a user to record their 
experiences or to experience 
the 
lives 
of 
others, 
is 

worryingly predictive of body 
cam footage and the ubiquity 
of smartphone cameras. Just 
as Spielberg made an argument 
for due process and against 
prior restraint with the crime-
predicting 
technology 
in 

“Minority Report,” Bigelow 
treatises on the role of social 
technology in the future of 
both crime and justice. 

While 
“Strange 
Days” 

remains an extremely dark 
dystopian film throughout its 
runtime, one of the things I 
liked best about the film is that 
it offers a glimmer of hope and 
justice at the end. The central 
fantasy of this movie is that the 
people at the height of power 
in our society saw the tapes of 
police brutality and acted to 
change it. If that fantasy is ever 
to become a reality, we need 
more fearless, experimental art 
like this.

Behind Enemy Lines: Ryan Dunleavy

The Michigan football team 

(2-2 Big Ten, 5-2 overall) once had 
its eyes on the College Football 
Playoff.

Then it played Penn State.
Now, with their goals realigned 

and their focus on what’s ahead, 
the Wolverines meet the polar 
opposite of the Nittany Lions. 
Rutgers (2-2, 3-4) comes to Ann 
Arbor for the fourth ever meeting 
between the two programs, in a 
meeting of two wailing offenses.

Thursday, the Michigan Daily 

spoke with Ryan Dunleavy, a 
Rutgers beat reporter for NJ.com, 
to talk about the Scarlet Knights’ 
season and what Michigan fans 
can expect to see this weekend.

The Michigan Daily: Now 

that Rutgers has back-to-back 
wins, what are your thoughts on 
the team, and what are you going 
to be watching for from Rutgers 
this weekend?

Ryan 
Dunleavy: 
I 
think 

they’re getting much better. They 
were a team last year that so much 

of what they had to do was clean 
up off-field messes, and get the 
program image back in the right 
direction, get the recruiting back 
in the right direction. It was such 
a long-term rebuild that I think 
the onfield product almost had to 
take a back seat during year one 
(under coach Chris Ash).

In the last two weeks, you’re 

finally starting to see a little bit 
of progress on the field from the 
team getting some wins. It also 
shows you how bad the West 
division of the Big Ten is. It’s 
Wisconsin and a bunch of below 
average teams, which I’ve said 
all along. Rutgers, Maryland, 
Indiana all those teams would 
probably be bowl-teams in the 
West 
division, 
and 
Rutgers 

beating Purdue and Illinois only 
strengthens my case.

TMD: 
Rutgers 
switched 

quarterbacks two weeks ago and 
now plays Giovanni Rescigno. 
How has he played?

RD: The best way to describe 

how he’s played is ‘tough’ and 
‘smart.’ If you look at the stats, 
he’s certainly not going to win 

you over. He’s completed 50 
percent of his passes for about 
170 yards and one touchdown 
but no interceptions. That’s in 
two games. He’s certainly not the 
reason they’re winning games, 
but he isn’t the reason they’re 
losing games, which might be the 
reason they’re winning games.

He’s 
played 
smart. 
His 

teammates rally behind him. He’s 
a ‘gamer.’ He raises his game in 
practice, he improvises plays 
on the run. He bounces back up 
from tackles. He’ll take a big hit. 
He’s one of those guys teammates 
love to get behind. He’s got those 
intangibles that can really lift a 
team’s spirit. He’s helped Rutgers 
in that way.

He’s helped Rutgers not so 

much as a passer, not so much as 
a runner, but just as a good leader.

TMD: Rutgers runs the ball 

on almost two-thirds of its plays. 
If Michigan lines up with six or 
seven guys crashing the line, will 
that change Rutgers’ game plan 
at all?

RD: (Rutgers) will try to 

run it. It will change if they’re 

not having success, but their 
preference would be to find a way 
to have success even if Michigan 
is crashing the box. Rutgers is 
going to want to run the ball. 
They’re going to want to shorten 
the game. They’re going to want 
to have time of possession. That’s 
what they want to do.

They have no interest in getting 

into a high-scoring battle with a 
team that has superior talent.

TMD: Has there been any talk 

of revenge at Rutgers in regards 
to last year’s game?

RD: They’ve done a pretty good 

job of putting that out of their 
heads publicly. I think it’s on the 
back of everybody’s mind. That 
game was impossible to forget. 
Rutgers-Michigan is interesting 
because they’ve played three 
times and two of them are very 
memorable. One, Rutgers beat 
Michigan, and it was like, ‘Oh my 
god, how did that happen?’ It was 
Rutgers’ first Big Ten win in 2014. 
Last year, 78-nothing. You just 
don’t see that. You see 56-nothing 
all the time, but you don’t see 78 
nothing. I think for Rutgers it’s in 

the back of their mind, but no one 
has admitted that it’s an extra 
motivator.

TMD: 
Hypothetically, 
if 

Rutgers pulled off an upset, who 
would be the X-factor for the 
Scarlet Knights?

RD: It’d take more than one 

X-factor for Rutgers to beat 
Michigan. I know the teams 
have the same conference record 
but there is still a pretty big 
gap. I would start with Raheem 
Blackshear. He’s a true freshman 
running back who has scored 
touchdowns in each of the last 
two games. He’s just lightning-in-
a-bottle quick. He decommitted 
from Michigan State and ended 
up at Rutgers. A real difference 
maker, gets eight or 10 touches 
a game and makes the most of 
them.

Janarion Grant is a guy who 

had a big game on special teams 
the last time Rutgers was at the 
Big House. He was supposed to 
be their best receiver this season, 
but with his inconsistency he 
hasn’t really been much of a factor 
at all. If you told me Rutgers was 
going to win back-to-back games 
without Janarion Grant having 
much of an impact, I would not 
have believed that. He’s either 
due for a big game or destined for 
a bad year.

On defense, if Michigan is 

going to run the ball as much as I 
expect, Trevor Morris is Rutgers’ 
leading tackler — a linebacker 
who is just always around the 
ball. It seems like he has 10 
tackles every Saturday. What he 
doesn’t have is forced fumbles 
and interceptions. If he can turn 
all those tackles into tackles for 
loss or turnovers, that would be 
something that could swing the 
game.

TMD: Finally, your prediction?
RD: I pick Michigan, 42-7. I 

think both teams are going to 
run the ball, run the ball and 
run the ball all day long. I expect 
Michigan’s offensive line will 
be able to do a little bit better 
job than Rutgers’. Michigan’s 
defense will be able to do a better 
job stopping Rutgers. Michigan 
has too much depth.

I know Michigan is off to what 

they would consider a tough 
start, but bottom line is they just 
have too much talent right now.

The Daily spoke with a Rutgers beat writer for NJ.com ahead of Saturday’s matchup

The Rutgers football team is coming off consecutive conference wins against Purdue and Illinois, and running back Raheem Blackshear is a big reason why.


It all started with Jabrill 

Peppers.

On May 26, 2013, the 

New Jersey native made an 
appearance on ESPN, where 
he performed a freestyle rap, 
pulled out a winged helmet 
and officially committed to 
play football at Michigan.

Just like that, the No. 

1 recruit in the state was 
headed to Ann Arbor. The 
exodus had begun.

New Jersey wasn’t always 

a hotbed for college football 
recruits. 
Freshman 
safety 

and 
Jersey 
native 
Brad 

Hawkins remembers when 
his home was known only as 
“the basketball state.”

But eventually — perhaps 

while scouting stars like 
Peppers — teams saw what 

they were missing. Michigan, 
along with a collection of 
the nation’s elite programs, 
began mining for talent and 
enticed recruits to play their 
college football outside of 
their home state.

Chris 
Ash 
aimed 
to 

halt that process when he 
accepted the head coaching 
job in Piscataway just under 
two years ago.

He helped coin the phrase 

“Fence the Garden” — a 
mantra meant to symbolize 
Rutgers’ focus on keeping 
the best high school football 
players in New Jersey to 
continue 
their 
college 

careers.

And with the phrase came 

an odd rivalry.

At the beginning of June 

in 
2016, 
Jim 
Harbaugh 

organized one of his then-
infamous satellite camps at 

Paramus Catholic — Peppers’ 
old stomping grounds. On 
the same day, Ash brought 
in 
Urban 

Meyer 
to 

host a camp 
of his own 
just over six 
miles 
away 

at 
Fairleigh 

Dickinson 
University.

Rutgers 

students had 
their 
own 

response, 
too. 
The 

Order of the 
Bull’s Blood 
— a secret 
society at the 
university 
— claimed responsibility for 
acts of vandalism at Paramus 
Catholic that occurred in the 
days leading up to Michigan’s 

camp.

All 
past 
drama 
aside, 

though, Ash’s “Fence the 

Garden” 
mantra, to this 
point, appears 
to be all it was.

Roughly 
a 

month 
after 

the 
inception 

of the phrase, 
Rashan 
Gary 

— then the top-
ranked recruit 
in the nation 
— 
committed 

to 
Michigan. 

Kareem 
Walker, 
the 

top-ranked 
running 
back 

in 
the 
state, 

joined him.

A year later, the trend 

continued. Drew Singleton, 
a Union City, N.J. native 

ranked 
as 
the 
fifth-best 

recruit in the state according 
to the ESPN 300, signed a 
letter of intent to play at 
Michigan.

They aren’t the only ones 

either. 
The 
list 
includes 

Gary, 
Walker, 
Singleton, 

Hawkins, Hunter Reynolds, 
Joe 
Beneducci, 
Michael 

Dwumfour, 
Jon 
Runyan, 

Juwann 
Bushell-Beatty, 

Cheyenn Robinson and Ron 
Johnson. All on Michigan’s 
roster. All hail from New 
Jersey.

Some came before Peppers. 

Some came with him. But the 
majority came after him.

All 
it 
took 
was 
an 

appearance 
on 
national 

television.

“I think it definitely (opens 

the door), because growing 
up in Jersey, we looked up 
to guys like Jabrill when I 

was a kid,” Dwumfour said. 
“... When he made the move 
here, it definitely opened 
the eyes of guys like me in 
Jersey.”

***

The logic is simple.
“Jersey 
guys, 
we 
like 

to 
win,” 
Dwumfour 
said 

of 
Michigan’s 
increased 

presence in his home state. 
“So wherever fits us right 
and feels like home, that’s 
where we want to be.”

Unfortunately for Rutgers, 

it has failed to fit that criteria 
for a long time now.

Ray Rice was a sophomore 

the last time the Scarlet 
Knights 
had 
a 
10-win 

season. That came in 2006, 
when Greg Schiano’s team 
punctuated an 11-2 season in 
the Big East with a victory 
over Kansas State in the 
Texas Bowl. Before that, you 
would need to go back to 1976 
to find double digits in the 
win column.

The 
Scarlet 
Knights 

haven’t had a winning season 
in the Big Ten since their 
inaugural year when they 
finished 8-5 and beat North 
Carolina in the Quick Lane 
Bowl. And in the past two 
seasons, Rutgers has finished 
a combined 6-18.

It’s for those reasons that 

Hawkins and Bushell-Beatty 
remember growing up with 
little exposure to Rutgers 
football.

As a kid in New Jersey, 

Hawkins recalls watching 
“whoever gets the TV time 
pretty much.” The Scarlet 
Knights rarely received that 
big of a stage.

Someday they might, but 

to 
Nunzio 
Campanile 
— 

the head coach at Bergen 
Catholic 
in 
Oradell, 
N.J. 

— it’s a process that will 
inevitably take time.

“I think that success is 

relative,” 
Campanile 
said. 

“I think that if they start 
getting to the point where 
they’re winning five, six, 
seven games, I think some 
of those higher-level players 
might be willing to take that

‘M’ impedes Rutgers’ fight for Jersey

KEVIN SANTO

Managing Sports Editor

FILE PHOTO/Daily

Special teams coordinator Chris Partridge had experience in the New Jersey college football recruiting landscape, as he served as the head coach of Paramus Catholic for five years.

New Jersey has plenty of talent. The problem is that the Scarlet Knights can’t seem to hold on to it. 

Growing up 
in Jersey, we 

looked up 
to guys like 

Jabrill when I 

was kid 


leap.

“I think that kids would 

love 
to 
play 
football 
at 

Rutgers, and I think there’s a 
lot of real genuine interest by 
the kids in our state. … I don’t 
think you’ve got to go 12-0, I 
think you’ve got to show that 
you can be competitive, and 
I think they’ve shown that 
already this year.”

To some extent, Rutgers 

has. It owns two conference 
wins 
over 
Illinois 
and 

Purdue, and another over 
Morgan State.

But losses to Washington, 

Eastern Michigan, Nebraska 
and Ohio State hurt. It won’t 
get any easier, either. The 
Scarlet Knights close out the 
year at Michigan, Penn State 
and Indiana, with two home 
games 
against 
Michigan 

State and Maryland.

And 
it’s 
against 
those 

powerhouses that Rutgers 
must 
compete 
against, 

not only on Saturdays, but 
also throughout the entire 
recruiting cycle.

“Yeah I guess you get that 

little type of pressure,” Gary 
said. “I remember because 
Rutgers was one of my first 
offers and for a minute I’m 
like, ‘Wow they’re the first 
team that showed me that 
they really cared about me.’

“So I was gonna go, but 

then as more offers start 
rolling in and rolling in, I 
started looking more and 
really trying to find the best 
school for me, so Rutgers 
just ended up slipping off 
the board. But there’s always 
that pressure to go home.”

***

The statistics of the last 

three years show progress.

According to 247Sports’ 

rankings 
of 
New 
Jersey 

recruits, Rutgers had six 
recruits committed to play in 
Piscataway in 2015, three of 
whom were in the top 30.

From there, the Scarlet 

Knights made strides. They 
secured nine recruits, with 
four in the top 30, in 2016 
and 15 recruits — including 
the second- and third-best 

prospects — in 2017.

This 
incoming 
class, 

however, appears to be a 
regression.

Though it’s still early, 

Rutgers 
has 
just 
five 

players 
committed, 
but 

only one is among the 
state’s top 30 players.

Where 
Rutgers 
goes 

from here remains to be 
seen.

One man that may have 

an idea is special teams 
coordinator Chris Partridge, 
who joined Michigan’s staff 
in January of 2015 after 
serving as the head coach 
at Paramus Catholic in New 
Jersey for five years.

With 
that 
experience, 

Partridge 
witnessed 

firsthand 
what 
yielded 

success.

“Forming 
relationships, 

speaking to the kids, knowing 
all the kids no matter what 
— even if it’s a guy who’s 
not maybe a Big Ten player, 
or Big East in those days, 
or whatever it might be,” 
Partridge said. “The Division 
I guys, understanding who 
they are and what they can 
do and just having a really 
good grasp of the whole 
state. They did a good job 
there, and (they’re) making 
the inroads. I know that Greg 
Schiano did a good job with 
the high school coaches and 
with knowing even down to 
the Pop Warner coaches and 
stuff.

“You’ve got to cultivate the 

whole state there, and I’m 
sure the staff is doing that. 
Like I said, I wasn’t there 
at all with the new staff — 
they’re 
getting 
talented 

kids on the team, they have 
talented kids, so I’m sure 
they’re doing a good job with 
that now.”

Campanile 
sees 
that 

Ash is making those same 
inroads, whether it be by 
trying to develop personal 
relationships 
with 
the 

coaches, 
making trips 
to 
in-state 

high schools 
when NCAA 
regulations 
permit 
or 

creating 
events 
that 

get 
coaches 

involved 
with 
the 

Rutgers staff 
and program.

Of course, 

Campanile 
says 
he’d 

love 
the 

opportunity 
to 
see 
his 

players 
close 
to 
home. 

He 
would 
like 
to 
give 

their 
families 
the 
same 

opportunity.

Right now, though, that’s 

easier said than done.

“Let me preface this by 

saying I think Coach Ash 
is doing a great job trying 
to 
recruit 
New 
Jersey,” 

Campanile 
said. 
“But 

everyone that’s ever been 
the head coach at (Rutgers) 
has tried desperately to keep 
the best players in state. 

And it’s not an 
easy task. He’s 
worked 
really 

hard at it.”

Perhaps 

that’s the most 
frustrating part 
for the Scarlet 
Knights. 
No 

matter 
how 

hard 
their 

coach 
works, 

they 
need 

results in order 
to harvest the 
elite talent in 
New 
Jersey. 

And in order 
to 
get 
those 

results, 
they 

need 
more 

talent. So flows 

the cycle.

That’s not to say the cycle 

can’t be broken. But with 
other coaches like Harbaugh 
consistently besting Rutgers 
both 
in 
games 
and 
in 

recruiting, it won’t be easy.

Breakdown: Advantage, ‘M’

When No. 2 Penn State 

thrashed 
Michigan 
last 

week, 
the 
Wolverines 
(2-2 

Big Ten, 5-2 overall) were hit 
with a hard dose of reality. 
They may not be the College 
Football 
Playoff 
contender 

that they wanted to be at the 
beginning of the season, but 
that shouldn’t stop them from 
beating one of the worst teams 
in the Big Ten. 

Rutgers (2-2, 3-4) comes off 

back-to-back wins, but what 
it might boast in confidence it 
simply lacks in talent.

Both the Scarlet Knights 

and the Wolverines have their 
weaknesses right now, but a 
quick breakdown reveals that 
Rutgers’ weaknesses may be 
too large to overcome.

Here’s the Daily’s breakdown 

of what you can expect this 
homecoming weekend:

Michigan run offense vs. 

Rutgers run defense

The 
Wolverines’ 
most 

reliable 
offensive 
position 

group, the tailbacks, continues 
to be the source of scoring 
regardless of who they play.

Against Penn State, junior 

running back Karan Higdon 
led 
the 
team 
in 
rushing 

attempts for the third straight 
week, followed by fifth-year 
senior Ty Isaac and sophomore 
Chris Evans. Higdon and Isaac 
produced 
the 
team’s 
only 

touchdowns.

While 
that 
trio 
rotated 

starts in the first half of 
the 
season, 
Higdon 
began 

to separate himself against 
Michigan State. In that game, 
the team wasn’t passing well, 
but Higdon consistently ran 
for medium gains, and he broke 
out in his next appearance 
against Indiana for 200 yards 
and three scores.

The fourth addition to the 

group, 
redshirt 
freshman 

Kareem Walker, always has 
fans wondering when he’ll 
receive 
more 
consistent 

playing time. He bulldozed 
his way to an eight-yard rush 
against Indiana — his only 
attempt of the game — but 
Walker’s role on the team is 
still supplementary.

Rutgers has given up an 

average of 159 rushing yards 
per game, which presents a 
favorable 
matchup 
for 
the 

Wolverines.

Edge: Michigan
Rutgers run offense vs. 

Michigan run defense

The Scarlet Knights, much 

like the Wolverines, also prefer 
the run game. Rutgers has run 
the ball on 60 percent of its 
plays this season, and running 
back Gus Edwards leads the 
team so far with five rushing 
touchdowns.

Two other running backs 

— Robert Martin and Raheem 
Blackshear 
— 
also 
have 

multiple rushing touchdowns, 
but each of Rutgers’ backs are 
in for one of their toughest 
tests yet against Michigan’s 
run defense.

The Wolverines allow just 

105 rushing yards per game on 
average. Despite giving up 224 
yards on the ground against 
the Nittany Lions, Michigan 
should have a much easier 
time this weekend. After all, 
Rutgers’ running backs don’t 
pose the same threat as Penn 
State’s Saquon Barkley.

Edge: Michigan
Michigan pass offense vs. 

Rutgers pass defense

Fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback 
John 
O’Korn 

threw for 166 yards against 
the Nittany Lions, a significant 
increase 
from 
his 
58-yard 

outing 
versus 
Indiana. 

Nonetheless, the Wolverines 
pass offense just hasn’t looked 
the same since it lost both its 
starting quarterback, redshirt 
junior Wilton Speight, and its 
previously 
leading 
receiver, 

freshman Tarik Black.

The Scarlet Knights’ pass 

defense, though, has given up 
224 yards per game. If there 
is any game to let O’Korn air it 
out, it would be this one.

Saturday will actually be 

O’Korn’s third time playing 
Rutgers. Before transferring 
from Houston, O’Korn faced 
the Scarlet Knights back in 
2013. He led the Cougars to a 
49-14 win in one of the best 
games of his career, throwing 
for 364 yards, five touchdowns

What to Watch 
For vs. Rutgers

With two losses on the 

season, it might seem as if the 
Michigan football team (2-2 Big 
Ten, 5-2 overall) doesn’t have 
much left to play for. 

But 
according 
to 
the 

Wolverines, that isn’t at all 
the case. Even with a lowly 
opponent like Rutgers — which 
suffered a notorious 78-0 loss 
to Michigan in its own stadium 
a season ago — coach Jim 
Harbaugh and his team spent 
the week stating that there 
would be no drop-off in their 
effort level.

While the Wolverines might 

be tempted to overlook them, 
this isn’t the same Scarlet 

Knights team as in 2016. The 
new-and-improved 
Rutgers 

(2-2, 3-4) will likely pose a 
larger challenge than expected, 
and Michigan can’t afford any 
more slip ups this season.

Here’s what to watch for 

when the Wolverines face the 
Scarlet Knights on Saturday:

1. Will Brandon Peters see 

the field?

With each incomplete pass 

fifth-year senior quarterback 
John O’Korn threw against No. 
2 Penn State, anticipation built 
for an appearance from the 
redshirt freshman signal caller.

Though Peters never ended 

up taking the field in State 
College, the Michigan faithful 
have made it clear that a change 
will be desired under center 

and no interceptions.
Edge: Michigan
Rutgers 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan pass defense

The Scarlet Knights reopened 

their 
quarterback 
competition 

after their original starter, Kyle 
Bolin, had a horrific game in 
Rutgers’ 56-0 loss against Ohio 
State, when he threw for under 60 
yards. Giovanni Rescigno has held 
the starting job ever since.

Rescigno, a Michigan native, 

led his team to two straight wins, 
but he completed just 50 percent 
of his passes for a combined total 
of 176 yards.

He 
shouldn’t 
pose 
a 
big 

threat to the Wolverines’ fifth-
ranked pass defense. Sophomore 
cornerback Lavert Hill is drawing 
comparisons to former Wolverine 
and All-American Jourdan Lewis, 
and 
he 
leads 
the 
secondary 

with seven pass break ups, two 
interceptions and one pick-six.

Penn State’s receivers got the 

better of the Wolverines last week, 
but expect Hill and the others to 
come into this weekend hungry 
for a win.

Edge: Michigan
Special teams
With only one special teams 

touchdown, the Wolverines’ punt 
and kick returners haven’t made 
as much of an impact as last year. 
Two freshman handle Michigan’s 
returner duties: wide receiver 
Donovan Peoples-Jones takes the 
punts and defensive back Ambry 
Thomas returns kickoffs. Both 
have shown potential — Peoples-
Jones returned one punt for a 
touchdown against Air Force — 
but neither have made a significant 
impact.

Defensively 
though, 
the 

Wolverines haven’t allowed a 
single special teams touchdown. 
Rutgers returns each punt an 
average of 10 yards and each kick 
an average of just 14, which should 
not threaten Michigan’s special 
teams defense unit much.

In 
the 
kicking 
game, 
the 

Wolverines have the advantage as 
well. In close games at the start 
of the year, redshirt freshman 
kicker Quinn Nordin proved to be 
a difference maker.

With light wind and just a two 

percent chance of rain in the 
forecast, Nordin will be expected 
to hit every field goal he takes 
within 50 yards this weekend.

Edge: Michigan
Intangibles
Both teams have plenty of pride 

on the line. The Wolverines want 
to return to the AP Top 25, and 
Rutgers wants to wash out the foul 
taste of last year’s 78-0 whooping. 
Having slipped out of national 
attention, 
Michigan 
hopes 
to 

improve after the team’s worst 
loss since Harbaugh arrived.

Junior receiver Grant Perry 

said that the Wolverines want 
to take out all their frustration 
on Rutgers. If they do that, the 
Scarlet Knights don’t have much 
of a shot.

BREAKDOWN
From Page 6

Fifth-year senior quarterback John O’Korn may not remain the starting signal caller for the Wolverines for much longer if his offensive struggles persist Saturday against the Scarlet Knights in Ann Arbor.

if O’Korn’s struggles persist. 

While the blame doesn’t fall 
solely on O’Korn’s shoulders, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
passing 

game 
has 
been 
practically 

nonexistent of late. And though 
the running game has stepped 
up to help close the gap, a one-
dimensional 
offense 
doesn’t 

equate to a winning formula.

Even if this season isn’t 

pronounced over yet, Michigan 
should start looking to its future, 
especially with the amount of 
talent it will be returning next 
season. Peters is a major part of 
that youth movement.

With Michigan still favored 

to win, it wouldn’t hurt to see 
what 
the 
Wolverines 
might 

have to look forward to at the 
quarterback position.

2. Will the defense be able 

to reclaim the top spot in the 
nation?

In a battle of heavyweights, 

the 
Nittany 
Lions’ 
offense 

knocked 
Michigan’s 
then-

top-ranked defense out cold. 

After giving up 42 points and 
506 yards last Saturday, the 
Wolverines’ defense dropped to 
the fifth spot in the country.

Against Rutgers, Michigan 

will be eager to return to its 
prior form. Not only did the 
Wolverines post a shutout in 
Piscataway last season, but they 
have some experience with the 
type of offensive threat the 
Scarlet Knights pose. And it has 
nothing to do with Penn State 
running back Saquon Barkley.

Through the use of a run-

heavy 
approach 
on 
offense, 

Michigan 
has 
indirectly 

prepared its defense to take 
on Rutgers’ ground game. The 
Scarlet 
Knights 
are 
ranked 

62nd 
nationally 
in 
rushing 

offense with an average of 167.7 
yards per game and a total of 15 
touchdowns. For perspective, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
three-back 

rotation ranks 55th with 173.3 
yards per game and 11 scores.

If 
Michigan 
can 
take 

advantage of that edge, it may 

be able to return to its desired 
position as the best unit in the 
nation.

3. Can the special teams 

unit break out big plays?

So 
far 
this 
year, 
the 

Wolverines’ 
special 
teams 

unit has teased big-play ability 
without 
many 
dividends 
— 

aside 
from 
a 
79-yard 
punt 

return touchdown by freshman 
receiver 
Donovan 
Peoples-

Jones in the third game of the 
season.

With 
freshman 
defensive 

back Ambry Thomas now set 
as Michigan’s kickoff returner, 
the two Detroit natives have 
a chance to show off their 
speed and cutting ability on a 
consistent basis. While both 
have 
provided 
solid 
yards 

after the catch, special teams 
coordinator 
Chris 
Partridge 

emphasized that the Wolverines 
are pushing them to be more 
explosive.

As 
Partridge 
explained 

this 
week, 
that 
will 
also 

take a concerted effort from 
the 
blockers. 
He 
has 
been 

encouraging the unit to step it 
up a level and make more plays, 
especially 
given 
how 
close 

many of the team’s games have 
been this season.

Chances are, Rutgers will 

be sending a lot of punts in the 
direction of Peoples-Jones, but 
even if things go awry and the 
Scarlet Knights kick off more 
than expected, Thomas will be 
there as well.

4. 
How 
will 
Michigan 

respond to being back in the 
Big House?

It has been awhile since the 

Wolverines played at Michigan 
Stadium, and it didn’t go very 
well the last time.

After 
two 
consecutive 

games on the road, the contest 
against Rutgers will mark three 
weeks since the Wolverines’ 
devastating loss to Michigan 
State. 
With 
a 
homecoming 

crowd 
awaiting 
its 
return, 

Michigan will look to rid itself 

of those nightmares.

And after the reception they 

received in front of an all-time-
record crowd at Beaver Stadium, 
playing in front of their home 
fans again will be a welcome 
sight for the Wolverines.

Junior receiver Grant Perry and the passing game have underperformed recently, and the offense has suffered as a result. The running game has done its part to cover for it, but the passing game needs to step up.
