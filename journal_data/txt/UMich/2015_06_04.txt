Wolverines Lose to Florida in 
National Championship

Former 
AD named 
CEO of 
Toys ‘R’ Us 

DELANEY RYAN/Daily

Michigan coach Carol Hutchins and the No. 3 Michigan softball team meet after losing Game 3 of the WCWS Championship to 
top-ranked Florida. The Wolverines lost, 4-1, after surrendering three runs in the first inning in the winner-take-all game. 

Michigan came shy 
of the NCAA title, 
falling to defending 

champions

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

After falling to No. 1 Florida, 

4-1, in Game 3 of the Women’s Col-
lege World Series final, the Michi-
gan softball team came just shy of 
a national championship.

A complete performance from 

NFCA Player of the Year and 
right-handed pitcher Lauren Hae-
ger carried the Gators to an early 
lead, and they never looked back. 
Haeger dominated on both sides 
of the ball, shutting down the 
third-ranked Wolverines’ offense 
which didn’t register a single hit 
until the fifth inning. 

The Gators wasted no time on 

offense. In the bottom of the first 
inning, Haeger flared a 1-1 pitch 
to shallow center with runners on 

first and second. One run scored, 
and Florida was off to the races 
with no outs. A pair of batters 
later, Florida’s Taylor Schwarz 
dropped a double into left field, 
making headway for outfielder 
Nicole Dewitt and Haeger, who 
reached home safely, increasing 
their lead to three before the first 
inning came to an end.

“They were the best team 

tonight,” said Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins. “They’ve been 
No. 1 all through the season. They 
showed up to come after us, and 
that first inning broke our back. 
We gave them a lot of free bases, 
too many, and you can’t do that to 
a team like Florida.”

Florida’s leadoff hitter Kelsey 

Stewart came up to bat for the sec-
ond time in just the second inning 
and blasted a double to left that 
scored outfielder Justine McLean 
from second base. The Gators’ 
fourth run of the day prompted 
Michigan coach Carol Hutchins 
to take senior left-handed pitcher 
Haylie Wagner out of the circle for 
sophomore right-hander Megan 

Betsa.

Betsa solved the immediate 

puzzle and struck out two straight 
batters to strand three Gators on 
base.

Freshman first baseman Tera 

Blanco recorded the Wolverines’ 
first hit of the night, ripping a full-
count pitch to left field in the top 
of the fifth inning. Sophomore 
shot stop Abby Ramirez followed 
up with a single of her own, and 
the top half of the order would 
come up.

With two outs and two on for 

junior second baseman Sierra 
Romero, if there was a time for the 
team’s superstar to step up, this 
was it. Romero sent the first pitch 
to left field and Blanco, from sec-
ond base, was able to score. The 
Gators got out of the fifth inning, 
but Michigan had finally gotten on 
board.

Freshman pinch-hitter Amanda 

Vargas stepped to the plate in the 
sixth inning and produced, lining 
to center for a base hit. Next, Wag-
ner, now the designated player,

 Position is Dave 
Brandon’s first 

post after resigning 
as ‘U’ athletic director 

By LAURA SCHINAGLE and

ZACH SHAW

Summer Editor in Chief and 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Former Michigan Athletic 

Director Dave Brandon has 
been named the new CEO of 
Toys “R” Us, according to a 
Tuesday press release from 
the company.

“I consider it a tremen-

dous privilege to assume this 
important leadership role at 
Toys ‘R’ Us, one of the most 
well-known retail brands in 
the world,” Brandon said in a 
statement. “I believe our best 
days are ahead of us and I’m 
eager to get started.”

This is Brandon’s first post 

after his resignation from the 
University in October 2014.

In the months leading up 

to his resignation, Brandon’s 
management was criticized 
for being irresponsible and 
financially misdirected. He 
grew the Athletic Depart-
ment’s revenue to one of the 
highest in the country and 
used a growing surplus to 
enhance facilities and sala-
ries, but students and fans 
saw his policies to emphasize 
donation totals rather than 
fan longevity. 

The Athletic Department 

also came under scrutiny after 
The Michigan Daily reported 
in January 2014 that former 
Michigan kicker Brendan Gib-
bons was “permanently sepa-

Taste of Ann Arbor 
exhibits dishes 
from local eateries

Due to weather, 

vendors make last- 
minute changes to 

menus

By JACKIE CHARNIGA

Daily Staff Reporter

The annual Taste of Ann 

Arbor event took over Main 
Street on Sunday, despite rainy 
conditions.

A ticketed event, Taste of 

Ann Arbor featured delica-
cies from more than 40 of Ann 
Arbor’s well-known eateries 
such as the Arbor Brewing 
Company, The Blue Tractor 
and Silvio’s Organic Ristoran-
te with food types ranging 
from 
greasy-spoon 
to 
the 

high-end culinary creations. 
Several restaurants entered 
dishes that were considered by 
six judges for the annual “Best 
of Show” prize.

Ticket sales for the event 

were coordinated by volun-
teers from the Michigan The-
ater, to whom a portion of the 
proceeds will be donated.

Mary Kerr, president and 

CEO of the Ann Arbor Con-
vention and Visitors Bureau, 
was one of the six judges 
at this year’s competition. 
Responsible for the selection 
of this year’s entrees and Best 
of Show, Kerr described what 
goes into a winning dish at the 
festival.

“The restaurants do a really 

good job of showcasing their 
overall business, so from food 
to presentation, hearing the 
knowledge about the food, 
their enthusiasm working at 
the booth,” Kerr said. “I think 
it really depends on what 
really stands out that day, it’s 
important to talk to the chefs 
about their ingredients and to 
have the opportunity to say, ‘I 

can really taste that.’ ”

Server Kayla Samolewski 

and pastry assistant Danielle 
Valentine of La Dolce Vida 
added hot chocolate to their 
lineup to combat the cold.

“The hot chocolate was def-

initely a last-minute adaption. 
So we had ice cream sand-
wiches originally and then oh 
my gosh, it was raining, so we 
decided to add hot chocolate 
shooters instead,” Samolewski 
said.

La Dolce Vida’s pastry chef 

of two years, Jordan Conn, 
said the shooters were made 
of unsweetened cocoa powder, 
sugar and whole milk. Conn 
added salt to the mix, giving 
the drink a bolder taste.

Main 
Street 
Association 

executive director and full-
time event organizer Maura 
Thomson has participated in 
Taste of Ann Arbor since 2005 
and said she has noticed an 
increasing spike in popularity.

“We have, assuming good 

weather, doubled in atten-
dance since 2008, and last 
year’s Taste of Ann Arbor had 
over 15,000 people,” Thomson 
said.

Thomson attributes the dra-

matic growth of the event to 
that of social media.

“Social media has changed 

everything,” said Thomson. 
“So now the exponential value 
of having 40 restaurants pro-
mote their section is what has 
increased awareness overall of 
the event.”

Thomson also spoke to the 

importance of sustainability 
in the food community of Ann 
Arbor, and said Taste of Ann 
Arbor is sensitive to cutting 
down on waste. “We need to 
take steps to be a ‘zero-waste 
Taste,’ ” said Thomson.

“It’s 
about 
keeping 
the 

downtown area vibrant and 
healthy. At the end of the day,

UM-Flint expands program to online format 

School will offer 
Master of Arts in 
Liberal Studies 

online in Fall 2015

By ALEX JUNTTI

Daily Staff Reporter

For the first time, the oldest 

graduate program at the Univer-
sity of Michigan- Flint — Master 
of Arts in Liberal Studies — will 
be available for students in an 
entirely online format. The pro-
gram will be implemented this 
fall.

The new structure of the pro-

gram was conceptualized in an 
effort to provide the flexibility 
and tools necessary for working 
adults to pursue an interdisci-
plinary graduate degree either 
full time or part time.

Established in 1977 as a Rack-

ham Graduate School initiative, 
the Master of Arts in Liberal 
Studies program consists of 33 
semester hours of graduate work 
focused on a broad variety of 
topics in American history and 
culture, encouraging students 
to explore and analyze issues 
associated with national iden-
tity, such as race, gender, poli-
tics and religion. In addition, 
each student must complete a 

thesis and present it to a panel 
of faculty and peers during the 
student’s final semester.

Currently, all core courses 

are available online as well as 25 
approved elective courses. An 
increasing amount of elective 
courses will be available online 
in coming semesters.

Jan Furman, director of the 

Liberal Studies program, spoke 
about how transitioning to an 
online curriculum is helping to 
broaden educational opportuni-
ties.

“It’s a part of making graduate 

education available, accessible 
and more democratic,” Fur-
man said. “The wonderful thing 

about the program is the curric-
ular flexibility because we can 
work with students to fine-tune 
a curriculum that meets their 
goals, but we’re now at a place 
where we need to modernize 
our delivery. If we still want to 
reach working adults, then the 
most effective way of doing that 
is through online instruction.”

Frederic Svoboda, a professor 

in American literature, film and 
culture, added that the inter-
active online format is a great 
way to draw in active learners 
and expand the program’s reach 
beyond the immediacy of cam-
pus.

“Really good students do just 

as well online because they’re 
very active, but the people in 
the middle are actually pulled 
in by the format and become 
more active, and what we’re 
hoping will happen, and what I 
think will happen with the Lib-
eral Studies program online, is 
that we will get a group of very 
involved students or people who 
really want to become involved,” 
Svoboda said. “As soon as you 
put the program online, the 
students can be anywhere. It 
really broadens the market for 
the program, but it also allows 
people who otherwise can’t get 
to campus to still participate in

this event is about our com-

munity,” Thomson said. “Our 
goal is to connect people to this 
downtown.”

Despite the large portion of 

the student population hav-
ing left for the summer, many 
remaining 
students 
attended 

the event. Rising LSA senior Ben 
Brenner is a frequent patron to 
the Main Street restaurants. He 
said he enjoys the more social 
atmosphere of the event.

“It was definitely advertised 

as more of a townie event,” 
Brenner said. “A lot of the people 
in my house hadn’t even heard 
of it.”

Kerr 
said 
the 
community 

should take advantage of the 
various eateries available in the 
Ann Arbor area.

“Ann Arbor is known as a 

foodie destination — over 200 
restaurants are located in the 
area,” Kerr said. “You may not 
agree with me, but we’re prob-
ably one of the best food destina-
tions outside Chicago.”

Thompson said Taste of Ann 

Arbor highlighted the growth of 
the local food scene.

“The Ann Arbor food scene 

has grown, and continues to 
grow, over the last 10 years,” 
Thomson said. “I feel like this 
is another example of how the 
Ann Arbor food scene has grown 
and is shining and that is what’s 
showcased here today.”

Brady Hoke was criticized for

terback Shane Morris’ helmet-to-

Brandon’s resignation came days 

after MGoBlog.com <a href=http://

Brandon had responded to fans’ 
e-mails in ways many considered 
unprofessional. The e-mails con-
tained messages such as, “I suggest 
you find a new team to support. I 
really don’t care about your opin-
ions,” and “Quit drinking and go to 
bed.”

Per the terms of agreement 

for his resignation, Brandon was 
scheduled to receive a $3-million 
settlement over four years from the 
University. However, according to 
the agreement, the University can 
lower the settlement amount based 
on income he would receive from a 
new job. 

Before his tenure as athletic 

director, Brandon built a business 
career in Southeast Michigan. 
He served as the CEO of Valas-
sis Communications from 1989 to 
1999, then held the same position at 
Domino’s Pizza from 1999 to 2010.

investment firm that hired Bran-

OPINION

W

e still had 30 minutes left 
before making the trek 
to Charley’s on the eve 

of my friend’s 21st 
birthday. To pass 
time, we watched 
that night’s epi-
sode of “Last Week 
Tonight with John 
Oliver,” 
guaran-

teeing a laugh and 
a lesson.

Two weeks later, 

I can only think 
about the lesson.

In May 17’s epi-

sode, Oliver dissected the contract 
farming of chickens. While the show 
snarkily mentioned the horrible 
reality chickens face before becom-
ing our food, it mainly focused on 
the treatment and conditions of 
chicken farmers by Big Agriculture. 
In one specific instance, Oliver com-
pared the lives of chicken farmers to 
that of indentured servants.

Currently, chicken is the most 

consumed meat in the United States. 
Consumption has nearly doubled 
in the last 25 years, from 80 million 
to 160 million chickens per week. 
However, merely four companies — 
Tyson, Perdue, Pilgrim’s and Sander-
son Farms — control the majority of 
the poultry market. This monopoli-
zation of the meat market has effec-
tively created a system where most 

chicken farmers live near or below 
the federal poverty line.

Contract farming is disturbing-

ly popular in our nation’s poultry 
industry, with 97 percent of chickens 
raised by contract in 2011. In theory, 
contract farming sounds like a good 
practice, but in reality, it’s a manipu-
lative, greedy system. Poultry com-
panies own the birds, the grain fed 
to the birds and the meat processing 
companies. They dictate the arbi-
trary requirements farmers must 
comply with, such as the number of 
fans or the brightness of the light 
bulbs in a chicken coop. They rate 
the chicken farmers produce against 
others in their area, creating a gladi-
ator-like system, as Oliver dubbed it.

Meanwhile, poultry farmers put 

all of their resources, money and 
lives into their farms, believing they 
will make the sums of money that 
companies imply is normal. How-
ever, after a decent first year, the 
income of most chicken farmers 
declines as they are pushed further 
into debt after being forced to make 
inexplicable upgrades. Many chicken 
farmers refuse to publicly speak out 
against the deplorable conditions 
they endure in fear of retribution. 
While poultry companies claim arbi-
trary penalties don’t exist, the fact 
that most farmers are completely 
unwilling to speak against their con-
ditions suggests otherwise.

T

aking the venue into 
full 
consideration, 

attending 
the 
2015 

Mackinac 
Policy Con-
ference last 
Wednesday 
undoubt-
edly 
posi-

tioned 
me 

in the midst 
of 
some 

unexpected 
grandeur. 
Dressed in 
an ill-fitting 
pencil skirt 
and an over-sized black car-
digan — two articles of cloth-
ing from my sparse selection 
of professional business attire 
— it didn’t take long for me to 
begin feeling slightly out of 
place within the historic and 
elaborate rooms of the Grand 
Hotel on Mackinac Island. 
The surrounding atmosphere 
was 
extraordinarily 
lavish 

as politicians, entrepreneurs 
and committee members con-
gregated to discuss strategies 
and solutions for some of the 
state’s most pressing issues.

The issues addressed were 

serious and important, and 
those expressing their view-
points did so poignantly and 
passionately. 
However, 
as 

much as I tried to, I couldn’t 
bypass the elitist tone perme-
ating the conference. In fact, I 
only felt the air of exclusivity 
lift during discussions of revi-
talizing skilled trades in Mich-
igan, and it wasn’t even until I 
was in a different environment 
completely that I realized the 
full impact of these speeches.

While policymakers con-

tinued to navigate between 
various avenues of action, 
I found myself navigating 
across the Straits back to my 
hometown in the Upper Pen-
insula. I, in a matter of days, 
had gone from the role of a 
well-dressed member of the 
media covering a conference 
with an expensive admission 
fee to wearing tattered, holey 
jeans and assisting my father 
with custodial work at his 
workplace. Some may easily 
view this transition as a social 
and professional downgrade. 
Numerous times in the past, 
I’ve seen and heard belittling 
statements about the work-
ing class levied at my family, 
friends and neighbors. Even 
in an area like my hometown 
— where a large portion of the 
available employment options 
are found within the service 
industry or in the skilled 
trades — arrogant, demeaning 
views about the working class 
are far too prevalent.

During the policy confer-

ence, Mike Rowe, founder of 
the mikeroweWORKS Foun-
dation and former television 
host, addressed this stigma 
and advocated for the recon-
ceptualization 
of 
society’s 

definition of “a good job.” 
Rowe, in particular, humbly 
and knowledgeably empha-
sized the idea that a four-year 
degree from a university isn’t 
necessarily crucial to a suc-
cessful, sustainable career. To 
further stress this to the pop-
ulation of the state at large, 
the conference served as the 
venue to show one of a set of 
videos, created as collabora-
tive effort between the state 

and Rowe’s foundation, which 
will be shown to students to 
pique their interest in the 
skilled trades.

Rowe, as he called atten-

tion to high unemployment 
and a widening skills gap 
throughout 
the 
country, 

stressed that society needs 
to “stop demonizing a whole 
category 
of 
good 
jobs.” 

Across the country, the indi-
viduals that comprise the 
skilled labor force are aging, 
leaving available employment 
positions for the next gen-
eration. Michigan Governor 
Rick Snyder, as he discussed 
the pillars upon which the 
conference intended to focus 
on, described how cultivat-
ing 
talent 
and 
garnering 

more interest in the skilled 
trades and STEM programs 
was a priority. According to a 
statement from Snyder, 8,300 
jobs in fields such as welding, 
electrical work and computer 
drafting are currently open 
right now.

These spots, however, are 

left vacant due to the degrad-
ed status with which society 
views this type of work. Uti-
lizing a poster as a visual aid, 
Rowe described how its slo-
gan “Work Smart, Not Hard” 
was “the single worst piece of 
advice the country has ever 
taken.” The poster, displaying 
a college graduate juxtaposed 
against a depressing image of a 
blue-collar worker, presented 
a dichotomy between success 
and failure and between a ful-
filling career and drudgery. 
Rowe analyzed the image and 
discussed his inability to asso-
ciate the miserable tradesman 

A poultry dilemma

The policy paradox

figure portrayed with the real-life 
conception of a tradesman he saw in 
his grandfather.

This point resonated with me the 

most. Skilled trades — though the 
actual definition and examples of 
work may have admittedly changed 
over time — provided the backbone 
for not only generations of my family, 
but for the area in which I grew up. 
Whether it was construction, mining 
or work as a self-employed barber, 
members of my family worked hard 
and performed honest, dignified, 
necessary blue-collar work to sup-
port their families and themselves. 
As career options, technology and 
society are continually evolving, the 
nature of skilled trades changes. Our 
perceptions of these fields need to be 
modified then as well.

For me, my siblings and many oth-

ers, college may be the most suitable 
avenue to foster our own unique sets 
of talents and abilities to achieve our 
particular aspirations. Yet, it’s the 
diversity of skill sets in our society 
that necessitates the reforms sug-
gested at the policy conference to 

strenghten the skilled trades indus-
tries. Without generations of fam-
ily 
working 
these 
“undesirable” 

blue-collar jobs, I wouldn’t have been 
provided with the opportunity or the 
means to choose to attend a univer-
sity or to choose one path over anoth-
er. Giving individuals the ability to 
choose and the awareness of oppor-
tunities is crucial. While the videos 
are certainly a good start, more atten-
tion needs to be directed at dispelling 
the stigma that skilled trades jobs 
are lacking in worth by emphasizing 
the importance of funding vocational 
and STEM training in our education 
 

system.

Although the initiatives to bolster 

the skilled trades were proposed in 
a particularly expensive and exclu-
sive setting, the actions taken and 
the goals set at the conference were 
admirable and need to be followed 
through with in order to make signif-
icant changes in both the economic 
and societal landscapes.

little over a week ago, 
during Game Four of the 
NBA Western Confer-

ence 
Finals, 

Stephen Curry 
of the Golden 
State Warriors 
fell hard, hit-
ting his back, 
neck and head. 
 

He remained on the ground for a 
few minutes and was taken out of 
the game, head in hands. Accord-
ing to NBA policy, a player who 
has hit their head and is suspected 
of having a concussion is removed 
from the game for a neurological 
examination. Curry was removed 
from the game, but he was cleared 
to return to play only one hour 
later — missing the equivalent of a 
quarter of the game.

Only a day later, Klay Thomp-

Curry’s 
teammate,

kneed in the head. He was taken 
out, but returned to the bench a 
few minutes later. He was only 
ruled out a second time after he 
began bleeding and required 
stitches. Despite being cleared 
of a concussion by the Warriors 
medical staff, after the game he 
was not feeling well and began to 
exhibit signs of a concussion. A 
few days later, he was diagnosed 
with a concussion. The incident 
was so confusing, even his agent, 
just a day before his diagnosis, 
was adamant that Thompson 
didn’t have a concussion.

Watching both Curry and 

Thompson fall hard on the court 
and then reappear shortly after, 
cleared of concussions, horri-
fied me. How could they pos-
sibly know the extent of their 
head injuries in such a short 
period of time? However, as 
much as we would like to have a 
quick and easy diagnosis — and 
an even quicker recovery for any 
and every injury — both take 
time, and there’s no safe way to 
cut corners.

The weekend before Thanks-

giving vacation this past year, 
I slipped and fell on black ice. 
My head hurt, but the pain went 

away after a half hour or so. I 
chalked it up to a bad fall and 
went along with the rest of my 
day. That afternoon and into the 
early evening I didn’t experi-
ence any of the normal signs of a 
concussion. It took me an entire 
day to realize I may have a con-
cussion, and another three days 
to start experiencing a massive 
and constant headache Advil 
couldn’t alleviate that ultimately 
lasted for weeks. Additionally, 
according to my doctor, a brain 
scan wouldn’t have indicated 
anything, because the concus-
sion was not severe enough to 
cause any visible brain damage.

Head injuries cannot be taken 

lightly. It could be hours or days 
before people begin to experience 
concussion-like symptoms, which 
further sheds light on the prob-
lems with the 
methods 
used 

to 
deal 
with 

sport-related 
head 
injuries. 

Hallway 
jog-

ging tests and 
preliminary 
concussion 
tests that last 
less than one 
hour shouldn’t 
be the manner used to assess head 
injuries that could, later on, turn 
out to be worse than first expected. 

Instead of clearing a player 

to go back into the game after a 
quick round of tests, there needs 
to be a change in the way injuries 
during the game are handled. 
Taking a player out for the rest 
of the game, whereupon a doc-
tor not so closely affiliated to the 
team assesses the player over a 
few days, is an imperative step to 
change the system. What’s more, 
these organizations need to take 
the pressure off of the players to 
make the decision to go back into 
the game. After all, who wants to 
pull themselves out of a game? As 
it is now, the way we deal with 
these injuries not only hurts the 
athletes, but also the sport. No 
matter if the player ends up being 

fine, there’s always a chance that 
they are not, as was the case with 
Thompson. 
Thompson 
should 

never have been cleared to play 
(even though he never played).

Approximately 300,000 sport-

related brain injuries — most of 
them concussions — occur every 
year in the United States. Among 
people ages 15 to 24, sports inju-
ries are the second most common 
cause of traumatic brain injuries 
behind motor vehicle crashes. 
The problems we face when deal-
ing 
with 
sports-related 
head 

injuries are also problems at the 
high school and collegiate levels 
— as we saw most recently when 
Michigan football quarterback, 
Shane Morris, was brought back 
into the game, despite having a 
concussion. Rules at the collegiate 
level that permanently take play-

ers out of the 
game after a 
head 
injury 

would 
have 

prevented 
his re-entry, 
as there are 
no such rules 
right now. 

There’s no 

doubt 
that 

we’re already 

raising awareness about the seri-
ousness of concussions, but inci-
dents such as these indicate that 
we need to take swifter action. 
Whether it’s at the collegiate or 
professional level, it seems that 
the player’s health is not empha-
sized enough. Instead of focusing 
on when these injured athletes can 
return to play, the focus should be 
on their health. Continually ques-
tioning when they can get back in 
the game will only increase the 
pressure on everyone to get them 
back onto the court. It’s the job of 
the officials, the people in charge 
of the game and the coaches to put 
their foot down and send the mes-
sage that the health of the athletes 
unequivocally comes first.

In last year’s Appropriations 

Committee in the U.S. House 
of Representatives, Rep. Marcy 
Kaptur (D–Ohio) advocated for 
a bill rider that would allow for 
farmers to speak about their 
conditions without fear of retali-
ation. Unfortunately, the amend-
ment failed in a 20-29 vote.

There’s still hope, though. The 

committee is set to meet again 
to discuss the 2016 Fiscal Year 
Commerce. At the end of “Last 
Week,” 
Oli-

ver called for 
viewers to con-
tact the 51 U.S. 
House Repre-
sentatives that 
make up the 
Appropriations 
Committee to 
urge them to 
support 
more 

protective 
legislation for chicken farmers. 
Notifying your representatives 
and threatening them with the 
term “chicken fuckers,” as Oliver 
suggested, is an easy and some-
times effective option to help 
enact change.

However, no matter how effec-

tive I believe our government is, 
the representative system isn’t 
enough. Citizens must combat 
the root of the problem: preda-
tory corporations.

As the biggest meat industry 

in the United States, it seems 
unlikely that chicken consump-

tion will decrease anytime soon. 
Switching to local poultry prod-
ucts to push the industry toward 
change is a more viable solution.

This capitalistic system exists 

in many of society’s food indus-
tries. Choosing companies in the 
market that create an ethical 
product will help decrease the 
percentage of living things being 
taken advantage of and under-
mine predatory practices.

I thought about all of this 

awful infor-
mation Oliver 
highlighted 
in his late-
night 
talk 

show 
while 

at Charley’s, 
trying 
to 

convince my 
friend to take 
his shot.

Maybe eat-

ing locally and ethically created 
products is a better reality than 
trying to completely eradicate 
poultry from American diets. 
Personally, I feel a little bit bet-
ter knowing the chicken I just 
ate wasn’t tortured throughout 
its entire life and the farmer who 
helped produce it in order to cre-
ate a livelihood for himself and 
his family wasn’t taken advan-
tage of by evil organizations.

It seems like a small step in the 

right direction.

ALBUM REVIEW

‘Whispers’: too 
much, too soon

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Imaginary friends of children have 

always been an object of fascination 
for us. We can give any number of 
psychological rea-
sons for why and 
when 
children 

are most likely to 
have them, but 
there’s 
always 

that tiny doubt at 
the back of our 
minds: What if 
they’re something more than just fig-
ments of imagination?

The idea that children in their 

wide-eyed innocence could see or 
know something more than the jaded 
teenagers and the cynical adults they 
turn into is frightening ... but also 
intriguing.

ABC’s “The Whispers,” which pre-

miered June 1, presents this famil-
iar plot line to us with a new twist. 
It leans more toward complicated 
tech-y science fiction than, say, the 
paranormal, saccharine campiness 
of “Ghost Whisperer.” Set against a 
suburban backdrop of baseball games 
and bubble blowing in backyards, 
“The Whispers” follows the children 
in the outskirts of D.C. talking to peo-
ple — or things, as we’re gradually led 
to believe — that aren’t there. Their 
parents are ready to dismiss this as 
normal age-appropriate behavior, 
until the “friend” convinces these 
children to play a game, which always 
turns out to be dangerous — especial-
ly for adults. It involves activities like 
creating and detonating a bomb and 
rigging a treehouse so a mother falls 
to her death, while her daughter looks 
down through the jagged wooden 
planks at her, calling, “You can stop 
playing the game now.”

Lily Rabe (“American Horror 

Story”) gives a believable, if at times 
muted, performance as Claire Ben-

nigan, an FBI agent returning to the 
workplace and a mother to a young 
deaf son. Rabe’s own skill in creat-
ing a nuanced but realistic rapport 
with the children she’s questioning 
is complemented by the young actors 
of the show, notably Abby Fortson 
as Harper — the young girl who 
watched her mother fall through the 
treehouse floor. The most captivating 
part of “X Marks the Spot” is, by far, 
watching the children, who all seem 
to know the same imaginary friend 
named Drill. He speaks sometimes 
through the lights and other electri-
cal appliances.

The other adult actors are less 

lucky than Rabe. The dialogue they’re 
given to work with usually falls flat 
due to the half-hearted expository 
writing and predictably mundane 
complaints about home, work and 
marital problems. 

The writers tried to do too much in 

the single episode, but it held together 
anyway. Though the children and 
their imaginary, insidious friend 
could have been intriguing enough 
to carry the show, the writers threw 
in some more sci-fi stuff that doesn’t 
really mesh easily and naturally with 
the imaginary friend plot. There’s a 
creepy guy who always manages to 
show up whenever a child is play-
ing the “game” — until he passes 
out unexpectedly and wakes up in a 
hospital bed, staring dazedly at his 
own tattoos — and there’s something 
weird going on in the Sahara Desert 
with rocks and electricity. Oh, and of 
course there’s some government con-
spiracy afoot somewhere.

“The Whispers” has its entire sea-

son ahead of it to develop the story-
lines and blend them together — but 
the pilot was too much, too fast. If that 
was supposed to keep us watching, it 
may have done so for some viewers. 
But most will approach the follow-
ing episodes with considerably more 
skepticism and higher standards.

‘Surf’ ’s multiple genres

Eclectic album 

hints toward future 

of hip hop

By WILL GREENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Last Thursday was the worst 

possible time to be running on 
inadequate sleep. When Chance 
the 
Rapper 

and The Social 
Experiment 
dropped 
Surf 

that 
night, 

I 
grappled 

with the same 
question 
all 

modern-day 
hip-hop 
fans 

have to endure 
in this era of 
random-album-
dropping mania: Stay up to hear it 
or listen in the morning? I made 
the game-time decision to wait 
until the morning, but would try 
to get up early and go through the 
tracks as soon as I could. All this 
is to say, I woke up Friday with a 
bad combination of emotions — 
groggy, grumpy and with high 
expectations.

Surf is one of the highly antici-

pated albums of the year, with 
many fans waiting to see what 
new magic comes true when phe-
nom Chance gets his hands on 
a project. However, this album 
was advertised as a collabora-
tive effort to involve more of The 
Social Experiment band, led by 
Nico Segal — trumpet player with 
Chance and previously with Save 
Money companion Vic Mensa. 

Time and time again, Chance 

and The Social Experiment crew 
offer their emotions through 
music so honestly it can be off-
putting if you’re not ready for it. 
They create music that straddles 
the line between euphorically 
delightful and cheesy. Try see-
ing the group live; they push their 
listeners to the brink of their 
emotional capacity and ask them 
to trust that no one will fall off a 
cliff. Much of the time, it works 
to great effect, creating a satis-
fying vibration that puts a smile 
on your face. But, if you’re in the 
wrong frame of mind, as I was for 
my first listen through of Surf, the 
music will fall flat in your unwel-
coming ears. 

So, before evaluating Surf we 

need to understand what it is. 
First, it’s not a rap album. We’ve 
known that from the begin-
ning. Chance has said repeatedly 
in interviews leading up to the 
release that this has been Don-
nie Trumpet’s project. Segal 
controlled the project from day 
one, according to Chance, and he 
orchestrated a variety of sounds 
and genres, combining his own 
playing ability with the musical 
abilities of a swath of other great 
talents. For those looking for a 
follow-up to Chance’s fame-mak-
ing Acid Rap, you will not find it 
here.

That’s not to say there isn’t 

rap, or even good rap. Chance 
delivers several delightful vers-
es throughout, most notably on 
“Wanna Be Cool,” that are craft-
ed more delicately than those 
from Acid Rap.And then there 
are the features. Big Sean, J. Cole, 
Busta Ryhmes, B.O.B, Janelle 
Monae, BJ the Chicago Kid, Non-
ame Gypsy, Jeremih, Quavo (of 
Migos), D.R.A.M., Jesse Boykins 
III, Erykah Badu, Raury, King 
Louie and Jamila Woods all make 
appearances on Surf (So much for 
not a rap album, huh?). The inter-
net is still trying to compile the 
full list of contributors; the track 
list includes no feature credits. 
Each guest provides their own 
flavor to their respective songs, 
with superpowers like J.Cole and 
Busta Ryhmes delivering reli-
ably solid verses and others, most 
notably Quavo, blend surprisingly 
well with Segal’s instrumental 
creations. 

More than anything we’ve 

seen so far from this branch of 
Save Money, Surf pushes the 
boundaries of experimental hip 
hop, being simultaneously too 
musical and too carefully crafted 
to fit nicely into any specific sub-
set of the genre. Segal exhausted 
his creative abilities to great and 
compelling effect here, wield-
ing a variety of genres across the 
tracks. “Slip Slide” resembles a 
New Orleans marching band, 
centering on drums and horns; 
“Nothing Came to Me” and coun-
terpart “Something Came to 
Me” display Segal’s remarkable 
trumpet playing chops, creating 
a theatrical, explosive sound that 
knocks your socks off. There’s 
also the ethereal, dream-like 
tracks such as “Warm Enough” 

and “Questions,” which employ 
more computer crafting. 

The album is a magic trick. 

Segal and The Social Experiment 
take musical concepts we’ve seen 
before and blend them before our 
eyes in a way that’s hard to get 
our head around — here I have 
an ordinary rap verse, now watch 
what happens when I do THIS! If 
I had to take a stab at defining the 
genre, I’d call it endorphin-induc-
ing. Still, the music challenges lis-
teners to internalize the sound as 
is, without trying to understand 
intent or complete definition.

Surf requires several listens, 

even if you woke up in a good 
mood. There is so much going on 
within each track that you can’t 
fully evaluate it until you under-
stand just how much work went 
into it. Upon revisiting “Some-
thing Came to Me,” I realized 
the intricacies of the base under-
neath the trumpet, all together 
creating a stirring, infectious 
instrumental. Each track is rich 
in musical flavor this way, conjur-
ing unavoidable sentiment and 
calming joy. Aside from the many 
tracks with singular genre influ-
ences, the culmination of effects 
can be found in the irresistible 
tracks such as “Wanna Be Cool,” 
“Slip Slide” and the previously 
released “Sunday Candy.” These 
are the ones that conjure a smile 
almost without fail.

As Andrew Barber — writer 

for local Chicago blog Fake Shore 
Drive who got an exclusive first 
listen of Surf — wrote, the album 
“was meant to be played in the 
whip. It’s a summer album.” 
He’s right — it’s an ear-pleasing 
delight, but it’s also going to grab 
the attention of hip hop as anoth-
er large step toward a new age of 
rap music. 

For all the “it’s not a rap album” 

talk, there are too many big names 
laying verses here for this to go 
overlooked. 
The 
collaboration 

of this eclectic group offers an 
unwritten consent that this is the 
direction hip hop is heading. Plus, 
the passion of artists like Donnie 
Trumpet, Chance, and the rest of 
The Social Experiment is unlike-
ly to lessen anytime soon. While 
it might not be a rap album right 
now, it is likely a sign of things 
to come in the genre. Surf will be 
remembered as a key landmark 
when mapping the transition into 
the next generation of rap.

Florence + the Machine’s 
3rd LP is in need of quirk

ALBUM REVIEW

‘How Big, How Blue, 

How Beautiful:’ a 
break-up album

By MELINA GLUSAC

Daily Arts Writer

I first heard “Ship to Wreck” 

driving home from work on one of 
those out-of-the-blue sizzling May 
afternoons. (Mich-
igan weather, you 
keep any sense of 
normalcy in check. 
For that, I thank 
you, I hate you, I 
love you.) My caf-
feine buzz was long 
gone as I collapsed 
into the car around 
4 p.m., unleashing 
my pony tail and 
rolling the win-
dows down all the 
way so as to pump 
my stomach free of the day’s air-
conditioning overdose. Hey, we do 
what we have to.

To hear Florence at this point 

in time was nothing less than fit-
ting — a gift, actually, bestowed 
upon me by the almighty radio out 
of pity, necessity and graciousness. 
You see, Ms. Florence Welch doesn’t 
just come on the radio. She yawps, 
belches, even wails through your 
speakers with that great throaty 
voice that somehow reflects every 
bit of longing, heartbreak and 
ecstasy you’ve ever felt. Even at the 
lowest volume, “Ship to Wreck” is 
a characteristically epic, blossom-
ing tune. And it was perfect to hear 
it after a long day, cruising down 8 
Mile, wind in my hair. There was 
something very Perks-of-Being-a-
Wallflower-y about it all. 

So when How Big, How Blue, 

How Beautiful came out, I expected 
that aura of sad-happy infinity to 
percolate. A beautiful record, to be 
sure, Florence + the Machine’s third 
installment in its already impressive 
legacy is a bit pop-y, a lot devastat-
ing and often monotonous. We can’t 
forget how Florence burst onto the 
scene in 2009 with Lungs, a grace-
ful, harp-laced debut, and then fol-
lowed it up with 2011’s hauntingly 
essential Ceremonials But How^3 
ditches the one-word title pattern 

(and, unfortunately, much inven-
tive energy) and amps up the mel-
ancholy — sometimes in the band’s 
favor, sometimes not. 

This is, first and foremost, a 

break-up album. Every good one 
has a standout song. For Flo and 
the gang it’s “What Kind of Man,” 
an ethereal-meets-angry build-up 
melody that brings on the soul. It 
starts out easy until Welch stomps 
to the top of her royal soapbox 
(reserved for ginger goddesses only) 
to preach to her man about all his 
emotional wrongdoing. What kind 
of listener could resist this delicious 
British disdain?

Welch tries happiness on for size 

with “Delilah” and “Third Eye.” 
The latter is a refreshingly stripped 
number that has her handsomely 
chanting, “Hey look up! You don’t 
have to be a ghost here amongst the 
living!” (Thanks, Flo!) “Delilah” 
works just as well, with a catchy, 
interesting intro and one raw drum 
in the background. Joy suits Brits, 
too.

The album’s title track, though, 

sets the tone to snooze, and it’s hard 
for even the most seasoned artists 
to puncture that miasma of tired-
ness. “How Big, How Blue, How 
Beautiful” and “Queen of Peace” 
find Welch reveling in typical “Flor-
ence” territory — melodies that 
rest on her lovely voice, a comfort-
able, often-visited key and tiringly 
depressed lyrics. This is the band’s 
main issue. All of that is pretty, but 
after two and a half albums of it, 
it’s nothing special anymore. Bring 
back the harps or the weird lyrics 
about sacrifice (see: “Rabbit Heart 

(Raise It Up)”) or anything fresh, 
for that matter. How Big, How Blue, 
How Beautiful is in desperate need 
of quirk.

Nevertheless, the album’s acous-

tic ballads shine. “Various Storms 
& Saints” is a stunning journey to 
simplistic instrumental land; Welch 
weaves her softened-up way around 
a sole electric guitar played as deli-
cately as an acoustic one, and the 
result is ghostly, sexy and calm. 
“Long & Lost” elicits similar inti-
macy with eerily ascending backup 
whispers. And the sheer restraint 
of “St. Jude” adds to serious refine-
ment — Welch controls her cry here 
and shows she can still be mysteri-
ous while doing it. Clever girl.

“Caught,” perhaps the most pop 

of the bunch, is charmingly sad. It’s 
exactly the kind of song they play in 
a rom-com after Girl and Boy break 
up, during a montage of Girl doing 
various mundane activities with 
a little less “joie de vivre” because 
something just doesn’t feel right. 
Usually Girl or Boy then does some-
thing about that unsettled feeling, 
and the movie ends with a great kiss 
or reunion or splitting of a strand of 
spaghetti.

Does this album do that in the 

end? Does Florence make amends 
with her elusive male muse, with all 
things big and blue and (I’m assum-
ing, tragically) beautiful? Not quite. 
But one listen to the otherworldly, 
extro-spective symphony of hums, 
drums and fuzzy guitars on the 
closing “Mother” and you can’t help 
but feel infinite again. She got there. 
We got there. And at least the win-
dows were down along the way.

“Imma wreck that ship”

‘Aquarius’ isn’t 
binge-worthy TV

By MATT BARNAUSKAS

Daily Arts Writer

“Goddamn Hippies!” – Eric 

Cartman, “South Park”

Set in 1967’s Summer of Love, 

NBC’s “Aquar-
ius” 
finds 

itself 
filled 

with a bevy 
of the weed-
smoking 
counter 
cul-

turists, ready 
to say “man” 
a million times and be annoyingly 
uncooperative toward series pro-
tagonist, detective Sam Hodiak 
(David Duchovny, “The X-Files”).

Filled with neo-noir overtones, 

the show paints Hodiak as the typ-
ical grizzled veteran clashing with 
the younger generation, embodied 
by young undercover cop, Brian 
Shafe (Grey Damon, “Twisted”). 
True to type, Hodiak lives a lone-
ly life, with a soon-to-be ex-wife 
(Jodi Harris, “Grey’s Anatomy”) 
and a struggle to not slip back into 
alcoholism, which he undoubtedly 
succumbs to.

Hodiak’s life becomes a lot more 

interesting, though, when a former 
lover, Grace (Michaela McMa-
nus, “Awake”), asks him to help 
locate her daughter Emma (Emma 
Dumont, “Inherent Vice”), who 
has run away from home and taken 
up with what happens to be the 
eventual Manson Family, led by the 
Charlie Manson (Gethin Anthony, 
“Game of Thrones”) himself.

NBC has staked an inter-

est in the series, putting all epi-
sodes online, available to stream 
instantly. It’s a bold move by the 
network in an industry that has 
been upheaved by the presence of 
Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime. 
However, “Aquarius” lacks the 
inherent binge-ability present in 
series such as “House of Cards” 
and “Orange is the New Black.” 

The biggest issue present in its 

early episodes is that “Aquarius” 
struggles to establish a forward 
momentum necessary to convince 
a viewer to plunge themselves 
down the rabbit hole and watch 
multiple episodes in one sitting. 
Hodiak’s storyline unfortunately 
gets bogged down in a case-of-
the-week structure that looks to 

serve as a Sparknotes guide to all 
the issues that were brewing dur-
ing the late 1960s. A notable exam-
ple is African-American activist, 
Bunchy (Gaius Charles, “Friday 
Night Lights”), who starts as a 
member of the Nation of Islam in 
the second episode and then con-
verts to the Black Panther Party 
by the fifth. Bunchy’s change is 
never fully seen during the initial 
episodes, just the result. Instead 
of feeling organic, his evolution is 
reduced to a plot point by the writ-
ers so they can continue crafting 
their ’60s historical primer.

The proto-Manson family also 

struggles. While Anthony pres-
ents Manson with solid contrast 
of menacing and delusional, his 
storyline about wanting to enter 
the music business and the life 
within his commune, while based 
on Manson’s life, doesn’t make for 
very exciting content. Manson is at 
his best when he’s trying to force 
people to bend to his will, prey-
ing on their fears and insecurities 
while presenting himself as either 
a savior or executioner. But the end 
goals, like getting a demo recorded, 
are incredibly low stakes.

Emma’s presence doesn’t aid 

the Manson storyline either. The 
character is just dull, serving as 
the conventionally misunderstood 
teen, whose parents are too busy 
arguing to pay attention to how 
hard she has it as an attractive 
upper-class white girl. The only 
entertainment the character gives 
is an unintentionally hilarious 
acid trip near the end of Episode 
4, filled with bad acting and worse 
effects.

Seeped in sepia tones, “Aquar-

ius” does present an intriguing 
setting for a noir-influenced show. 
The social conflicts are present; 
one case involving a cop and a 
Black teenager being choked to 
death eerily echoes with current 
events. Duchovny is more than 
serviceable as a troubled detec-
tive trying to do right within an 
increasingly apathetic precinct. 
However, the tendency of the 
show to fall back to familiar pro-
cedural formulas while never fully 
creating an engrossing overarch-
ing narrative prevents “Aquarius” 
from being the binge-worthy show 
it hopes to be.

Drawn in by the diversity of

the flexibility of the curriculum

meet those needs.

“With Liberal Studies, I was

strict agenda is in place,” she

was hit in the shoulder. Anoth-

er two-on, two-outs situation for 
Michigan’s offense, and this time it 
was Blanco’s turn.

But yet again, the Gators got out 

alive when Blanco grounded out to 
the short stop. Overall, the Wolver-
ines could not handle Haeger in the 
circle Wednesday night. She was 
named the tournament’s Most Out-
standing Player.

“(Lauren Haeger) was great 

tonight,” Hutchins said. “A very 
deserving champion. She definitely 
took care of business.”

Against 
Betsa, 
the 
Gators 

couldn’t get a single run, as the Big 
Ten Pitcher of the Year handed 
Florida eight strikeouts. However, 
she hit a multitude of batters to load 
the bags and was taken out in the 
bottom of the sixth when Wagner 
returned to the circle.

In the final inning, Ramirez got 

onto first base as Florida’s short 
stop couldn’t handle her slapper in 
time. Michigan’s next batter, junior 
centerfielder 
Sierra 
Lawrence, 

struck out looking, and Romero 
returned to the plate. Romero 
grounded to the shortstop, who 
tossed to second for the next out, 
and sophomore outfielder Kelly 

Christner stepped into the box, 
Michigan’s last chance.

But after three pitches, Christ-

ner grounded out to first, and the 
season was over. The Florida Gators 
were the 2015 National Champions.

“I told my team today, and I 

told my team (Tuesday), ‘Tonight 
doesn’t 
define 
our 
season,’ 
” 

Hutchins said. “We would’ve liked 
to walk out of here with the other 
trophy, but this has been a great 
team. I’m really proud of them.”

Michigan’s lone NCAA Title season after 

team lost to Florida Wednesday

Compher named ‘M’ captain, 
Nieves and Selman alternates

By ZACH SHAW

Summer Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan hockey team 

announced 
Wednesday 
after-

noon that junior forward JT 
Compher will serve as the team’s 
captain for the 2015-16 season.

Senior forwards Justin Sel-

man and Boo Nieves were named 
alternate captains.

“It’s an honor 

to be considered 
by the coaching 
staff and your 
teammates for a 
leadership posi-
tion,” Compher 
said. “To wear a 
letter on a team 
with such tra-
dition, I think 
all three of us 
are excited about the role. We 
work well together, and I think 
we have a really good opportu-
nity to make a difference on this 
team.”

The 
announcement 
comes 

after Compher tallied 24 points 
in his sophomore campaign. 
Though it failed to match the 31 
points he tallied in his freshman 
season — which earned him Big 
Ten Freshman of the Year hon-
ors — the forward developed 
as a leader and motivator, find-
ing success away from the puck 

while alternating between wing 
and center on the team’s top two 
lines.

“He competes more than 

anybody I’ve ever seen,” Sel-
man said. “When he competes 
in practice, it kind of fires you up 
and creates this contagious atti-
tude amongst the team.”

Added Nieves: “He’s fierce, 

he’s relentless, especially at prac-

tice. He gets 
guys 
going, 

he’ll hit you 
in 
practice, 

he 
doesn’t 

care who you 
are, he’ll find 
a way to get 
you going and 
it carries into 
the 
games, 

so it’s really 

good.”

Compher 
succeeds 
former 

linemate Andrew Copp, who 
gave up his senior season of eli-
gibility to join the Winnipeg Jets 
in March.

Selman and Nieves received 

the honor as two of the remain-
ing three seniors on the team. 
Nieves was fifth on the team 
in scoring last season with 28 
points, while Selman notched 
the team’s second-highest +/- 
with 18 and 23 points in 26 games 
after tallying just 13 points his 

first two seasons combined.

Still seeking their first post-

season berth after three seasons, 
the duo know they will need to 
elevate their game even further.

“As guys have left through-

out the years, our class has been 
pretty 
strong,” 
Nieves 
said. 

“Now it’s down to us, and I think 
we have what it takes to lead this 
group and get us back on track.”

Compher, Nieves and Sel-

man headline a core of 19 Wol-
verines set to return next fall. 
Despite the losses of forwards 
Zach Hyman, Dylan Larkin and 
Copp, the team’s top-three scor-
ers, high summer participation 
has the captain confident for his 
team’s upcoming voyage.

“Obviously the goal is to get 

back to the postseason, and it 
starts with the little things,” 
Compher said. “We have all 
the guys in town working out 
right now, and everyone’s really 
focused on making sure that 
each day is good, and the main 
thing for us is the attention to 
detail in the little things that we 
do.

“For 
us, 
the 
difference 

between making the (NCAA) 
Tournament and not is very small, 
so anything that you can do to 
improve yourself and improve the 
team has to be done if we want to 
make it back.”

“He’s fierce, 
he’s relentless, 
especially at 

practice.”

Rowing takes 10th at NCAA’s

By CHLOE AUBUCHON

Daily Sports Writer

On the final day of the NCAA 

Championships Sunday, the Michi-
gan women’s rowing team failed 
to capitalize on momentum from 
its second-place finish behind top-
ranked Ohio State at the Big Ten 
Tournament, placing 10th overall 
on the weekend.

The scene at the event was simi-

lar to the Big Ten Tournament, 
with the Buck-
eyes 
making 

history as the 
first-ever 
team 

to 
win 
three 

straight 
NCAA 

titles.

A strong per-

formance in Fri-
day’s heat races 
advanced Michi-
gan 
to 
Satur-

day’s semifinals, 
where all three of the Wolverines’ 
crews — first varsity eight, second 
varsity eight and first varsity four 
— placed in the top five in their 
respective heats.

These performances were good 

for entry for all three crews in Sun-
day’s petite finals to determine sev-
enth through 12th place overall, but 
failed to put any in the grand final.

The first varsity eight posted the 

strongest showing for Michigan on 
Sunday, finishing second (6:27.251) 
behind Brown in its heat and eighth 
overall.

The 
second-place 
finishers 

fought hard to maintain their 
standing throughout the race, 
especially after a late challenge 
from Washington State.

“I thought our varsity eight had 

a good race this morning,” said 
Michigan coach Mark Rothstein. 
“We were disappointed not to get 

into the grand 
final, but finish-
ing second in 
the second-level 
final, I thought 
it was a good 
race.”

Despite 
the 

weekend’s dis-
appointments, 
Rothstein 
has 

high 
hopes 

for the future 

of his young team. With only 
four seniors, this year’s squad 
improved steadily throughout the 
year.

The young rowers not only 

helped give the Wolverines their 
15th top-10 finish, but also gained 
valuable experience that will pro-
vide a solid foundation for next 
season.

“The vast majority of this team 

will be back next year, and I think 
this is something we can build 
on,” Rothstein said. “For a lot of 
our rowers, this was their first 
time racing at NCAA’s. So having 
been through it now, I think that’s 
going to help us a lot next year.”

The second varsity eight, made 

up of mostly underclassmen, fought 
a hard back-and-forth race with a 
late surge. The crew boasted two 
of the fastest 500-meter splits in 
the heat in the second half of the 
race as it propelled to a fight for sec-
ond place before ultimately falling 
back for a fourth-place finish in its 
heat and a 10th-place overall finish 
(6:36.280).

Michigan’s first varsity four 

also recorded a fourth-place fin-
ish in its race and a 10th-place 
overall finish (7:30.335) after 
coming off the starting line in 
fourth place and challenging Cal-
ifornia and Stanford for second 
place throughout.

Though the Wolverines raced 

hard and pulled together some 
close races, they simply weren’t 
at their best during the weekend’s 
regatta and didn’t show the same 
success that they did at the Big 
Ten Tournament.

“We didn’t peak well here,” 

Rothstein said. “We seemed to 
peak at Big Tens, and that was a 
little disappointing.”

Rugby finishes 
fifth at Nationals

By LELAND MITCHINSON 

Daily Sports Writer

Going into the Collegiate 

Rugby Championship this week-
end, the Michigan rugby team 
had the goal of a top-eight finish 
for the second year in a row.

The Wolverines put on an 

impressive performance on their 
way to achieving that goal and 
taking fifth.

Beginning the tournament in a 

pool with Arkansas State, UCLA 
and Texas, Michigan opened 
play against Arkansas State with 
the rugby community watching 
to see if its success from the year 
before was anything more than a 
one-hit wonder.

“Last year was considered a 

fluke that we made it there,” said 
Michigan coach Brandon Sparks. 
“This year we were largely dis-
credited 
by 

almost every-
one 
in 
the 

rugby media.”

Concerns 

that the team 
would 
not 

be 
able 
to 

reproduce 
its 
success 

due to a weak 
conference 
schedule and 
injuries going into the tourna-
ment seemed to be legitimate 
after Michigan lost to the Red 
Wolves, 17-5.

However, 
the 
Wolverines 

bounced back and showed that 
they can play at the highest level, 
leaning on their defense in their 
17-12 victory over UCLA and 
their 29-10 defeat of Texas.

Michigan added some good 

offensive play throughout the 
tournament to go with their stout 
defense, with senior Sequoyah 
Burke-Combs finishing pool play 
as the second-leading tri scorer 
in the tournament.

The Wolverines had the mis-

fortune of having to face the 
two-time 
defending 
national 

champions, California, in the 
quarterfinals and the Michigan 
team was simply outmatched, 
falling 31-0. Despite the big 
loss, the Wolverines were able 
to bounce back from a poor first 
half to limit the Golden Bears to 

a single tri in the second.

Cal would go on to win their 

third championship in a row 
with a 17-12 overtime win over 
Kutztown.

“Cal has the best collection of 

rugby talent in America,” Sparks 
said. “Where we recruit largely 
from the general student body, 
they are a varsity program, so 
they can bring players in that are 
rugby-specific.”

Michigan’s rugby club has a 

long history, though the college-
specific team did not begin until 
2000, and the team has only been 
playing the seven-on-seven ver-
sion of the sport competitively 
for two years.

“Most of these teams have 

had legitimate sevens programs 
for 10-plus years,” Sparks said. 
“There is a big learning curve 
with sevens because it is a lot 

different than 
the traditional 
game 
of 
fif-

teens.”

Though the 

team is rela-
tively 
young, 

there is a strong 
culture around 
the program.

“It 
starts 

with the sport,” 
Sparks 
said. 

“There are no true superstars in 
the sport. There are good ath-
letes that are made to excel in 
their environment because of 
their teammates. The sport is the 
foundation of it all.

“From there it is the players 

themselves, the level of account-
ability that they hold themselves 
to both on and off the field sets 
that standard, on time, be posi-
tive, don’t do anything to embar-
rass the shirt or your last name … 
it’s the players themselves con-
stantly trying to be better on and 
off the field.”

Sophomore infielder Carmen benedetti hit two home runs in the Wolverines’ two losses to No. 3 Louisville. 

By ZACH SHAW 

Summer Managing Sports Editor

LOUISVILLE — By the time 

Carmen Benedetti finished round-
ing the bases, Michigan looked 
like it had found one more dose of 
postseason magic.

The sophomore first baseman 

had just belted a two-run home 
run in the top of the first inning, 
and the Wolverines (39-25) were 
on top of No. 3 
Louisville (46-16) 
just four minutes 
into the game.

But by the time 

Benedetti 
came 

up to the plate for 
the second time in 
the fourth inning, 
the magic had run 
out.

Without a true 

starting 
pitcher 

available, Michigan instead got a 
healthy dose of reality, as its Cin-
derella run came to an abrupt end. 
The Cardinals scored early and 
often, thumping the Wolverines in 
a 13-4 defeat.

“We wanted to get out of the 

gate quick, and that was a two-out, 
two-run home run that was a huge 
lift that pumped us up,” said Mich-
igan coach Erik Bakich. “Unfortu-
nately, we just couldn’t keep up.”

The loss ends Michigan’s sea-

son, which was miraculously con-
tinued with a 4-0 run in the Big 
Ten Tournament and featured 

the most wins by a Michigan team 
since 2008.

After defeating Bradley, 4-3, 

earlier in the day, Michigan had its 
second chance against Louisville 
with some momentum after sur-
viving the first elimination game.

It disappeared quickly, howev-

er, as Louisville tallied 14 hits and 
scored in all but two innings. Five 
Cardinals had multi-hit games in 
the dominant affair.

“We 
didn’t 

lose 
today 

because 
we 

were 
scared, 

we 
just 

couldn’t 
keep 

up with them,” 
Bakich 
said. 

“But that’s the 
type of envi-
ronment we’ve 
been in over 
the past two 

week, and want to be in in the 
future.”

On offense, left-hander Josh 

Rogers retired 10 straight Wol-
verine batters after the home run. 
Michigan would piece together 
two more runs and 10 hits overall, 
but it paled in comparison to Lou-
isville’s outpour.

Even when the Wolverines did 

rally, Louisville was able to force 
three double plays with runners 
in scoring position to end the 
threat.

“The double play is a momen-

tum play, especially when it’s 

an inning-ending double play,” 
Bakich said. “You’re sprinting off 
the field and that gets some ener-
gy in the dugout. They certainly 
did a good job of getting ground 
balls and ending the rallies for 
us.”

“They have dominant pitch-

ing, that’s why they’re the No. 3 
national seed.”

In addition to Louisville’s top 

seed, two consecutive College 
World Series appearances and 
home-field advantage of rough-
ly 5,000 fans, Michigan’s odds 
of winning were even further 
diminished Sunday.

Freshman right-hander Ryan 

Nutof — normally the team’s No. 2 
starter — has been in the hospital 

with the flu since Thursday. Using 
its fourth starter, Evan Hill, in the 
earlier game, Michigan relied on 
spare bullpen parts in its biggest 
game of the season.

“We 
knew 

we were going 
to try to piece it 
together a little 
bit,” Bakich said. 
“We were down 
an arm, but we 
were just hop-
ing to try to keep 
them off balance and try some dif-
ferent looks at them. Unfortunate-
ly, it just didn’t work out that way.”

In the team’s worst loss since 

April 10, the shorthanded pitch-
ing staff was coupled with a sud-
den drop-off in defense (the team 
made three errors) and timely 
hitting to ensure that, after the 
first inning, the Wolverines were 
nowhere near contending with 

the Cardinals.

“All of those base hits and extra 

90’s add up, and we just had too 
many mistakes today that they 
took advantage of and they were 

able to score a 
lot of runs.”

Though most 

season-ending 
games 
result 

in 
glassy-eyed 

press 
confer-

ences 
full 
of 

short statements 

about the sting of defeat, Bakich 
leaned back and smiled when talk-
ing about his overachieving team.

“They’ll forever be champions, 

and that’s what they’ll be remem-
bered for.” Bakich said. “We’ve 
been that way for a couple weeks 
now where our backs are against 
the wall and we’re fighting for our 
lives and we’ve thrived in that sit-
uation. It’s been a lot of fun.”

AMANDA ALLEN/Daily

Junior right-hander and utility player Jacob Cronenworth is one of several team 
leaders likely to leave for the MLB Draft. He led the team in saves and base hits.

“We knew we 
were going to 
try to piece it 

together.”

“It’s been a lot 

of fun.”

softball falls in 

Championship, aims 

to rise once again

By CHRIS CROWDER 

Daily Sports Writer

Tera Blanco took a mid-60s fast-

ball to the upper arm. Her elbow 
guard was too low to protect her 
from the seven-ounce, neon yellow 
sphere spinning toward her. The 
freshman first baseman kneeled to 
the dirt in pain. She stayed there 
for the length of a breath and got 
back up to trot to first base.

The 
Michi-

gan

trials, but she didn’t offer a helping 
hand. They figured it out all by 
themselves.

“The biggest thing you have 

to do with these young kids is to 
throw them on the ground and 

say ‘Figure it out,’ ” Hutchins 
said before the WCWS began. 
“Eventually they figure out how 
to get up … I’m not afraid to 
throw them on the ground and 
say, ‘you want up? Get up.’ ”

The Wolverines came back 

from being down 3-0 in the first 
inning 
twice 
before 
against 

Georgia in the Super Regionals 
and against UCLA in the Wom-
en’s College World Series. Michi-
gan came back to win both times, 
but had never overcome a defi-
cit over three to win, which is 
what it faced in it’s sudden-death 
Game 3 WCWS Final against 
Florida on Wednesday. Four runs 
proved to be too many against 
the defending national champi-

ons.

Florida wasn’t 

alone 
in 
try-

ing 
to 
knock 

the Wolverines 
off their game, 
Michigan did it 
to 
itself 
inad-

vertently to dig 
its own hole. In 
the first inning, 
Haylie 
Wagner 

hit the first bat-

ter she faced. The next batter 
bunted, and Lauren Sweet threw 
down to second to get the lead 
runner out, but the attempt was 
a step too late.

In the second inning, sopho-

more third baseman Lindsay 
Montemarano overthrew first 
base. 
Sophomore 
right-hand-

er Megan Betsa entered and 
plunked the first two batters she 
saw.

Yet, 
the 
Wolverines 
only 

found themselves down four 
runs in the third 
inning when the 
freshman 
first 

baseman Blanco 
got hit. Four bat-
ters later, sopho-
more left fielder 
Kelly Christner 
stepped 
up 
to 

the 
dish 
with 

the bases load-
ed. She was the 
tying run, but 
she couldn’t connect on a 1-2 rise 
ball to put a dent in the Gator 
lead.

The Michigan offense struggled 

to string hits together, as Florida 
right-hander Lauren Haeger took 
a no-hitter into the fourth inning.

Blanco struck back in her next 

at-bat after getting hit, smack-
ing a single past the shortstop for 
the Wolverines’ first base knock. 
Junior second baseman Sierra 
Romero stepped up to the plate 
with two on and delivered, hitting 
a RBI-single to cut the deficit to 
three. Christner entered the box 
again as the tying run, but flew out 
to end the Michigan rally.

One run might’ve seemed like 

a disappointment with so much 
opportunity to score for the Wol-
verines, but it was a sign that they 
were picking themselves back 
up. Michigan displayed under-
standable, 
subtle 
frustration 

after hitting out even when they 

hit 
the 
ball 

square. 
The 

ball was hit 
well, but fell 
into the web 
of the glove 
instead of on 
the checkered 
green grass.

Meanwhile, 

Betsa 
kept 

racking 
up 

strikeouts like 

she’s known best to do. Even 
with two runners in scoring 
position in the Gator half of the 
fifth inning, she struck out the 
side to keep her team in it.

When the Wolverines could’ve 

easily laid down and given up, 
they kept themselves in the 
game. That’s the silver lining.

“They worked through adver-

sity,” Hutchins said. “They avoid-
ed a lot of adversity because they 
always believed. They believed 
that they were great.”

After Wagner got hit on the 

elbow pad in the sixth inning, 
she threw her bat down, either in 
pain or anger. Either way, Michi-

gan was losing the fight, getting 
hurt emotionally and physically 
by Florida. But the Wolverines 
kept standing, forgetting about 
their cuts and bruises.

Despite playing their hearts 

out, Michigan couldn’t overcome 
its early mistakes and the oppor-
tunities it couldn’t capitalize on. 
They didn’t win the National 
Championship, but have the 
right to count Wednesday’s loss 
as a moral victory.

“Sometimes all you have to do 

is make a decision on how you’re 
going to respond during adver-
sity,” Hutchins said before the 
team left for Oklahoma City.

Hutchins didn’t know where 

her team was going to end the 
WCWS, whether it be with a win 
or a loss. But she did know that 
her team would respond, win 
or lose, in a fashion that would 
made her proud.

Losing in the last game of the 

WCWS with the title so close is 
tough to live with. It’ll take some 
time to move on, but Michigan 
softball has done it before.

“We’ve stuck together through 

some hard times,” Romero said. 
“We’ve pushed through it. No 
matter what, we’re a family.”

There’s no evidence against 

them to say that they won’t pick 
themselves up again.
