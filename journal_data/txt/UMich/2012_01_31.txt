Arrest comes six
months after explicit
photos discovered
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily Staff Reporter
According to court records,
University officials waited six
months before reporting a Uni-
versity of Michigan Health Sys-
tem resident who possessed child
pornography in the hospital to
police.
Stephen Jenson, a medical
resident in the UMHS medicine-
pediatrics specialty program, was
arrested in December on charges
of possessing child pornography.
However, according to AnnArbor.
com, the arrest came six months
after he was originally accused of
possessing the explicit material.
According to an article on
AnnArbor.com, a female UMHS
resident found a flash drive left in
a computer in a locked lounge in
the Pediatric Emergency Depart-
ment on May 23, 2011. On the
flash drive was a sexually explicit
image of an adult and a child,
along with a medical document
with Jenson's name.

After seeing the image, the res-
ident went home and left the flash
drive where she found it. The next
morning, she reported her find-
ings to her superiors, but the flash
drive was no longer in the com-
puter, according to the article.
After his arrest, Jenson told
police that he had viewed child
pornography, "more than three
times but less than ten," accord-
ing to the article.
University Spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the University
found no evidence that Jenson
was, involved in inappropriate
activity with patients.
"We have investigated it thor-
oughly, and there has never been
any indication that these photos
involve patients, or that there has
been any patient misconduct,"
Fitzgerald said in an interview. .
After learning that UMHS offi-
cials waited to report the incident
to police, University President
Mary Sue Coleman launched an
internal investigation to exam-
ine the reasons for the delay in
reporting the issue, Fitzgerald
said.
Fitzgerald added that the pre-
liminary findings of the inquiry
showed that the incident was

Zingerman's,
People's Food

By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily Staff Reporter
As the University continues
to launch an increasing num-
ber of sustainable initiatives,
two long-standing businesses
have maintained long-term
commitments toward envi-
ronmental sustainability since
their foundations.

Zingerman's and the Peo-
ple's Food Co-op, prominent
businesses serving students
and community members
in Ann Arbor, have engaged
in environmentally-friendly
operations in an effort to cre-
ate a more sustainable city
through programs that encour-
age purchases of local products
and reduction of waste.
ENVIRONMENTALLY

After local businesswoman
Jean Henry closed Ann Arbor

restaurant Jefferson Market
and Cakery, she found a new
place in the Zingerman's orga-
nization, heading up the busi-
ness's transition to sustainable
environmental practices.
Henry - Zingerman's
"Green Queen" - said partners
in the businesses seek not just
to protect the interests of each
of Zingerman's several busi-
nesses, but also to safeguard
the health and well-being of
the company.
Henry said this attitude

LSA sophomore
chosen to introduce,
Obama last Friday
By HALEY4GOLDBFSRG
Daily News Editor
On Thursday morning, sev
eral students posted pictures to
Facebook of the coveted tickets
they secured after waiting in
line for hours to attend Presi-
dent Barack Obama's speech
the following day. One student,
however, was not able to share
her excitement to see the presi-
dent with anyone.
On Wednesday morning, LSA
sophomore Christina Beckman
received a phone call from thee
University's Office of Public
Affairs, where she holds a work-,
study position. After picking up'
the phone, she was informed
that she was appointed by Kelly
Cunningham, the University
Director of Public Affairs, to
introduce Obama at Al Glick
Field House later that week.
Beckman said she was not
allowed to reveal the news to
anyone beside her parents.
"It was such a hard thing to
keep in," Beckman said. "When
I'm so nervous and excited, I

almost needed someone there to
calm me down ... It was definite-
ly the hardest secret I've ever
had to keep in my life."
Beckman was able to provide
input in her introduction, which
had to be approved by White
House officials before the event.
Before she took the stage in
front of the crowd of 4,000 and
a national television audience,
Beckman said her nerves from
the days leading up to the event
subsided.
"On the day of Friday I was
calm, and I knew I wanted to
do really well representing my
school and my community,"
Beckman said. "... It's definitely
not an experience you can pre-
pare for."
In her speech before Obama's
address on increasing college
affordability, Beckman dis-
cussed her own struggles to
pay for college through taking
out loans and participating in a
work-study program.
"A lot of students go the dis-
tance to be able to pay for col-
lege, especially to go to school
at U of M, and it's something
that I'm willing to do to make
the investment in my future,"
Beckman said. "I think (Obama)

Daily Staff Reporter
Patients undergoing diagnostic
work at the University of Michigan
Health System may now feel safer
with the implementation of new
state-of-the-art imaging technol-
ogythatdecreasesthe damagingside
effects of radiation exposure.
UMHS is the first teaching hospi-
tal in North America to instituteVeo,
a new clinical technology developed
by General Electric that allows CT
scans tobe performed usinga signifi-
cantly lower dose of radiation than a
conventional scan.
Jeff Fessler, a professor of electri-
cal engineering, computer science,
radiology and biomedical engineer-
ing, contributed to the development
of Veo. As CT scans continue to be
used on patients more often, Fes-
sler said it's important to reduce the
amount of radiation used in order
to prevent harmful side effects on
patients.
Fessler said Veo acts as a mini
supercomputer that attaches to a CT

The underground parking
garage under construction at
.South Fifth Avenue between
East Liberty and East William
Streets was expected to be
complete bytoday.

But, it again missed its
deadline as the project
extends into February, and
orange construction barrels
and cement trucks will con-
tinue to line the street, leading
to prolonged dissatisfaction of
local business owners.
Ali Ramlawi, owner of
JerusalemGarden, claimsthat
business at his Mediterranean
restaurant has significantly
slowed since the beginning of
the projectin September2009.
The delays in opening the road

for traffic have only added to
Ramlawi's frustration.
"These folks (planning the
construction) are completely
out of touch with the project
they've initiated," he said.
Ramlawi added that offi-
cials working on the project
have told him several differ-
ent dates for the road to be
reopened - last August, Dec.
31, 2011 and Jan. 31 - and
none have been met.

Union alters guest policy

20 years ago this week (Febru-
ary 3,1992): At a party sponsored
by Omega Psi Phi fraternity in
the Michigan Union Ballroom, a
small fight escalated into a brawl
involving about 30 people, the
Daily reported. Most of the stu-
dents involved attended Eastern
Michigan University.
Once the fight broke out, it
took University Department of
Public Safety officers 25 minutes
to break up the melee and restore
order.
"There were three security
guys at each door, but when the
fight started, they stood around
and didn't do shit," one party
attendee told the Daily.
In response to the incident,

a policy was established that
banned guests from other univer-
sities.
35 years ago this week (Janu-
ary 30, 1987): With plans in mind
to expand the University's medi-
cal campus, officials approved
plans to demolish three buildings
of The Terrace, then University
Housing for single and married
graduate students. The complex
was cited as an expansion zone
for the hospital in the Board of
Regents' 1980 Medical Campus
Master Plan.
Officials told the Daily that the
residential buildings were being
torn down because of a lack of
sufficient parking on the Medical
Campus. Terrace resident Betsy

Smith criticized the move, not-
ing that, "If (the hospital) wants
something, theyget it."
40 years ago this week (Febru-
ary 2, 1972): The Big Ten athletic
directors approved a recommen-
dation by college football coach-
es for "redshirting," the Daily
reported. This would allow Big
Ten football and basketball play-
ers to sit for one year in order to
compete a fifth year of school.
In ,addition, a mandatory
retirement age of 55 for football
officials was approved, as well as
a six-man football officiating crew
to be effective during the 1972
season, according to the Daily.

EU nations pleadgeto stop
overspending in new treaty

6

Britain and Czech
Republic refuse to
sign fiscal compact
BRUSSELS - All European
Union countries except Britain
and the Czech Republic agreed
yesterday to sign a new treaty
designed to stop overspend-
ing in the eurozone and put an
end to the bloc's crippling debt
crisis, while EU leaders also
pledged to stimulate growth
and employment.
The new treaty, known as the
fiscal compact, was agreed at a
summit of European leaders in
Brussels yesterday. It includes
strict debt brakes and makes
it more difficult for deficit sin-
ners to escape sanctions. The 17
countries in the eurozone hope
the tighter rules will restore
confidence in their joint cur-
rency and convince investors

that all of them will get their
debts under control.
"We have a majority of 25
that will now sign up to the fis-
cal compact," Swedish Prime
Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said
last night after the summit of
European heads of government
in Brussels.
Although the new rules only
apply to the 17 euro states, the
currency union wants to get
broad support from the other
EU states, in hopes the accord
will eventually be integrated
into the main EU treaty.
Britain had said in Decem-
ber it wouldn't sign the new
treaty. Reinfeldt said the Czech
Republic didn't sign because
of parliamentary procedural
problems.
"I don't want to stand in the
way of what they think they
should do," British Prime Min-
ister David Cameron said of the
other countries. "But this is not
an EU treaty because I vetoed

that."
Leaders at the summit also
promised to stimulate growth
and create jobs across the
region, an acknowledgment
that their exclusive focus on
austerity has had painful side
effects.
"Yes we need discipline, but
we also need growth," said Jose
Manuel Barroso, the president
of the European Commission,
the EU's executive arm.
The leaders pledged to offer
more training for young people
to ease their transition into the
work force, to deploy unused
development funds to cre-
ate jobs, to reduce barriers to
doing business across the EU's
27 countries and ensure that
small businesses have access to
credit.
However there was no offer
of any new financial stimulus.
"We must do more to get
Europe out of the crisis," the
leaders said in a statement.

confident about Florida win

Gingrich promises
not to back down,
calls former Mass.
Gov. an imposter
MIAMI - Cheered by new
polls, Mitt Romney is all but pre-
dicting victory in tomorrow's
Republican presidential primary.
Newt Gingrich is looking past
Florida to regroup, vowing he
won't stay buried long.
"With a turnout like this, I'm
beginning to feel we might win
tomorrow," an upbeat Romney
told'a crowd-of several hundred
at a stop in Dunedin on yester-
day as he and Gingrich zipped
across the state making their
final appeals.
Gingrich, in turn, acknowl-
edged that his momentum had
been checked but promised not
to back down. He characterized
Romney as an imposter, and his
team started to plot a strategy for
upcoming contests.
"He can bury me for a very
short amount of time with four or

five or six times as much money,"
Gingrich said in a television
interview. "In the long run, the
Republican Party is not going to
nominate ... a liberal Republican."
GOP officials in Florida were
anticipating a big turnout, more
than 2 million voters, up from
1.9 million in the Republican pri-
mary in 2008. Election officials
had already received more than
338,000 absentee ballots, 37,000
more than the total early ballots
cast in the GOP primary four
years ago.
In the span of a volatile week,
the tables have turned in this
potentially pivotal primary state.
Gingrich rode a triumphant
wave into Florida after a South
Carolina victory nine days ago.
But since then, Romney and his
allies have pummeled the former
House speaker on TV and on the
campaign trail. Romney turned
in two strong debate perfor-
mance's, while Gingrich faltered.
Now opinion polls show the for-
mer Massachusetts governor
with a comfortable lead here.
Romney and Gingrich have
been te only two candidates to

compete in Florida in earnest.
Neither former Pennsylvania
Sen. Rick Santorum nor Texas
Rep. Ron. Paul campaigned much
in the state, and they were else-
where yesterday.
Clearly in command, Romney
flew to stops in media markets in
northern Florida and the popu-
lous swing regions of central
Florida, determined to keep Gin-
grich from surging late.
Romney renewed attacks on
his rival as an untrustworthy,
Washington influence ped-
dler at the outset of two sepa-
rate appearances yesterday. He
claimed that Gingrich's ties to
federally backed mortgage giant
Freddie Mac have hurt the for-
mer speaker in astate wracked by
the foreclosure crisis.
"He made $1.6 million in
his company, the very institu-
tion that helped stand behind
the huge housing crisis here in
Florida," Romney said in Dune-
din. Gingrich's consulting firm
received more than $1.5 million
from the federally backed mort-
gage giant over a period after he
left Congress in 1999.

Report proposes dividing Great Lakes,
Mississippi River to fight Asian carp

$9.5 billion project
aims to protect
both watersheds
TRAVERSE CITY, 'Mich.
(AP) - Groups representing
states and cities in the Great
Lakes region yesterday pro-
posed spending up to $9.5 bil-
lion on a massive engineering
project to separate the lakes
from the Mississippi River
watershed in the Chicago area,
describing it as the only sure
way to protect both aquatic
systems from invasions by
destructive species such as
Asian carp.
The organizations issued a
report suggesting three alter-
natives for severing an artificial

link between the two drainage
basins that was constructed
more than a century ago. Sci-
entists say it has already pro-
vided a pathway for exotic
species and is the likeliest route
through which menacing carp
could reach the lakes, where
they could destabilize food
webs and threaten a valuable
fishing industry.
"We simply can't afford to
risk that," said Tim Eder, execu-
tive director of the Great Lakes
Commission, which sponsored
the study with the Great Lakes
and St. Lawrence Cities Initia-
tive. "The Great Lakes have
suffered immensely because of
invasive species. We have to put
a stop to this."
The report's release is sure
to ramp up pressure on the

U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
which is conducting its own
study of how to close off 18
potential pathways between
the two systems, including
the Chicago waterways. The
corps plans to release its find-
ings in late 2015, a timetable it
says is necessary because.of the
job's complexity and regula-
tory requirements. A pending
federal lawsuit by five states 0
- Michigan, Wisconsin, Min-
nesota, Ohio and Pennsylvania
- demands quicker action.
"This study shows that
hydrological separation is both
technically and economically
feasible," said Rep. Dave Camp,
a Michigan Republican.
A spokeswoman said the
corps would not comment until
it could review the report.

Alaska rep. urges
federal takeover of
Central Park
When Alaska state Rep. Kyle
Johansen penned a resolution
to urge the federal government
to take over New York's Central
Park, he may not have expected*
a hearing on the issue let alone a
mention in The New York Times.
But he's got both.
The resolution from Johan-
sen, a Ketchikan Republican, first
reported by The Associated Press,
was highlighted in the Times'
City Room blog last week. And
the House Resources Committee
planned yesterday afternoon to
discuss HJR 31, which argues the
federal government's hold on the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
is akin to labeling Central Park
a wilderness area and halting
future improvements or develop-
ment there.
Public attention is all the reso-
lution will generate for now. One
of the bill's co-sponsors, Rep. Eric
Feige af Chickaloon, co-chair of
the Resources Committee, decid-
ed to hold the bill yesterday in
committee pending further dis-
cussion.

Zingerman's first environ-
mental effort was composting.
According to Henry, each of
Zingerman's businesses has its
own composting operations and
the goal of the program at Zing-
erman's is to start composting
meat scraps instead of throwing
them out.
The company also started
using more green cleaning
products, and now buys con-
centrated products with less
packaging - saving upward of
$30,000, Henry said.
Henry added that ensur-
ing cost effectiveness while
embarking on a "green" path is
crucial to maintaining the suc-
cess of the business.
"You can't do a sustainable
business plan that doesn't allow

the business to keep going," she
said. "You have to have a return
on investment that is positive.
It is not because we are profit
mongers at all. The business
runs on a 3 to 5-percent profit
margin ... it is just about having
enough profit to keep going."
Once the company saw mon-
ey-saving changes from making
the switch to environmentally
friendly cleaning products,
management started looking
for additional ways to reduce
waste.
Zingerman's is working on
improving heat insulation at
Zingerman's Bakehouse, the
company's bakery business,
which is undergoing a full-scale
energy audit. Henry said the
saved energy could be used to
provide air conditioning in the
summer, but this is still in the
works because of engineering
and funding complexities.
She noted that the heat
recapture project is emblematic
of Zingerman's environmental
goals as they are in the process
of fulfilling their vision they set
in October.
ORGANIC FOOD A
MAINSTAY AT CO-OP
Since 1971, the People's Food
Co-op - a small grocery store
located in Kerrytown -has
placed a major emphasis on
environmental sustainability
The co-op used to consist
of two stores, one on Packard
Street and one in Kerrytown,
before eventually merging into a
single store in the 1990s. Kevin
Sharp, interim general manager,
said the loss was tough but nec-
essary, as it enabled the owners
to better provide environmen-
tally sustainable products for
the community.
"It is just an inherent part of
what we do," Sharp said. "Forus,
to not do it is not an option."
Over the years, the co-op has

faced competition from other
grocery stores, but it never par-
ticularly worries Sharp.
"We are never going to com-
pete with the other stores,"
Sharp said. "We keep trying to
do what we do the best we can
... the real difference between us
and another store is that we are
a co-op, and people get to have
some say and ownership in their
food source."
Sharp said this sense of own-
ership and the products provid-
ed at the store gives the co-op a
unique market niche.
TheAnnArborFarmer's Mar-
ket also plays into building the
co-op's place in the community.
Sharp said many people view it
as a Saturday morning ritual to
first visit the Farmer's Market
and then pick up the rest of their
groceries at the co-op.
The co-op strives to be as,
sustainable as possible in its
product choice, as it stocks
about 3,000 certified organic
productions. Additionally, it
works with a network of about
18 to 20 local farmers - some of
whom the company has worked
with since its formation - sup-
porting the farming community
with over half a million dollars
in purchases.
With its mission to provide
environmentally sustainable and
natural foods, the People's Food
Co-op often incurs slightly high-
er costs. However, Sharp con-
tended that the co-op's prices are
competitive with other markets.
"We fully acknowledge that
natural foods are expensive," he
said. "But our prices are com-
petitive."
Sharp hopes that the co-op
educates people allout sustain-
ability and encourages them to
do live a mor environmentally-
friendly lifestyle.
"The idea is to do more," he
said. "(Because) we are not all
going to be experts in sustain-
ability."

REPORT
From Page 1
reported to the University in
May, but was dismissed by the
UMHS Office of the General
Counsel due to lack of evidence.
Fitzgerald said the case was
then reopened and fully investi-
gated in November.
"Once these allegations were
reported properly in Novem-
ber to the Department of Public
Safety, they were immediately
investigated, and the prosecu-
tor authorized criminal charges
against the resident who was
involved," Fitzgerald said.
The internal report, obtained
by The Michigan Daily, revealed
that the investigation was
stalled due to a number of issues
involving the line of responsibil-
ity and communication between
authorities.
"DPS and hospital security
have strong policies and pro-
cedures for their individual
departments, but weak commu-
nication protocols between the
two departments," the report
stated.
In a blog post yesterday, Ora
Pescovitz, the University's exec-
utive vice president for medical
affairs, called the incident "a
painful moment in our history,"
and she wrote that an investiga-
tion is being conducted to deter-
mine faults in the University's
reporting systems to ensure a
similar incident doesn't occur
again.

tuition could be lowered, and I
think a lot of students can relate
to that."
According to plan, Beckman
was to leave the stage after
introducing Obama, but the
president surprised her with
a handshake and a kiss on the
cheek before her exit.
"(The kiss on the cheek) was
incredible," Beckman said. "I
wasn't expecting that, but it was
great, obviously ... I think for-
ever, that will be my good side."
Before taking the stage, Beck-
man also had the opportunity
to meet the president. She said
Obama joked about not wear-
ing maize and blue and gave her
words of encouragement.
"He pulled me aside to ask me
about what I was studying... and
how I liked school and how it's
going," Beckman said. "He was
very down to earth ... and he told
me that he could tell I was going
to do agood job, and then he told
me, 'I'll see you up there."'
Central Student Government
President DeAndree Watson
spoke before Beckman on Friday
and described the experience as
an "honor." In his speech, Wat-
son discussed the importance of

"The creation, use and dis-
tribution of child pornography
is appalling on every level, and
in situations like this when
there are mistakes in how such
a situation was handled, human
nature makes us want to quickly
identify and resolve the prob-
lem," Pescovitz wrote. "Howev-
er, jumping to quick conclusions
and making assumptions with
partial information isn't the
answer. That's why the Uni-
versity is engaged in a compre-
hensive review into what went
wrong in this particular case."
Pescovitz wrote that the
review was a priority for her
and the University and it would
allow UMHS to reform its pro-
tocols. Pescovitz specifically
noted that UMHS remains
dedicated to protecting its
"most vulnerable" patients. She
encouraged UMHS employees
to promptly report "inappropri-
ate" incidents.
"It is our collective respon-
sibility to be diligent in report-
ing behaviors and actions that
are inappropriate, and that
we applaud and support those
who have the courage to do so,"
Pescovitz wrote. "It isn't always
easy to speak up, but it is always
the right thing to do. And it is
my and all leadership's respon-
sibility to thoroughly and timely
investigate reported concerns."

higher education, sharing his
experience as a student in the
Detroit Public School system
dreaming of attending the Uni-
versity.
"I really appreciated the
opportunity, and I was glad I
could do it," Watson said.
Watson said the central mes-
sage of Obama's speech was his
commitment to encouraging the
state to make higher education
a greater priority, something he
said CSG will help students aim
to do as well. He added that Uni-
versity Provost Philip Hanlon
plans to meet with CSG in the
future to discuss the construc-
tion of the University's budget
and the effect state and federal
funding have on tuition costs.
"I'm really excited to see that
(Obama's) committed to ... push-
ing the state to make higher
education a priority," Watson
said. "We really need to push the
state legislature to provide more
funding for education, so what
(CSG is) going to do is provide
the information that students
need ... to start contacting their
state legislatures."
Watson added: "All of those
things are going to happen soon
because we think it's really
important for students to have
their voices heard as well."

uncertain, but may be tied to dif-
ficulties of working outdoors.
According to a Jan. 24 annar-.
bor.com article, Susan Pollay,
executive director of the DDA,
said the remaining work at the
site is dependent on the weather
and moisture in the area, which
may hinder development.
Pollay did not respond to
multiple interview requests
from the Daily.
Regardless of the circum-
stances, Ramlawi said he is
disappointed in how the city is
handling the prolonged delay
and how the construction has
continued to negatively impact

businesses in the area.
City Council member Ste-
phen Kunselman (D-Ward 3)
said he understands the frus-
tration from business owners
who have seen a decrease in
sales because of the project.
"The fact that it is delayed is
unfortunate because we know
it's been very difficult for some
of the local businesses ... as
a council member, I am very
concerned about our local busi-
nesses," Kunselman said.
He added he hopes the proj-
ect will be completed before the
Ann Arbor Art Fairs, which are
scheduled for mid-July. If the
construction is not finished by
that time, Kunselman said it
could be "very concerning" to
both business owners and the

community at large.
"All I can hope is that every-
one involved is working expe-
diently to get the road open as
timely as they can," he added.
LSA freshman Caroline
Rourke said the construction
hasn't personally affected her
as a consumer, but is concerned
about its negative impact on
local businesses.
"Personally, it hasn't really
bothered me ... (but) it's not
okay that this is their third
deadline missed," Rourke said.
"They definitely need to take
action."
At this point, it is unclear
when Fifth Avenue will reopen
to traffic. For now, Ramlawi
said businesses like his are just
"weathering the storm."


TECHNOLOGY
From Page 1
plex mathematical algorithms,
it can process the same amount
of data as a conventional scan-
ner using less X-ray intensity,
therefore allowing the machine
to emit lower doses of radiation.
"We're doing an incred-
ible amount of processing of
the data to make an excellent
quality image out of data with
a lower X-ray dose," Fessler
stated.
Radiology Prof. Ella Kazer-
ooni has used Veo on patients at
the University hospital since it
was first installed in November,
and said it has been greatly suc-
cessful thus far.
"We're seeing similar image
quality at considerably lower
radiation doses," Kazerooni
said. "We really believe what is
behind this technology."
Patients experience no dif-
ference between Veo and the
conventional scanner when
undergoing the scan itself, but

Kazerooni said it takes Veo 50
to 60 minutes to process the
information and construct an
image. The conventional scan-
ner, however, can generate the
image almost immediately.
Because it takes longer to
produce an image using Veo,
Kazerooni said it is only being
used in routine outpatient
procedures when the patient
can afford to wait. For ICU
and emergency room patients,
Kazerooni said a conventional
scanner must be used in order
to generate an image quickly.
Kazerooni stressed .that
the dose of radiation a patient
receives depends on many fac-
tors, including the body part
being examined, the patient's
weight and the clinical question
being investigated. For exam-
ple, body parts like the skull
and pelvis are thick bones that
require more X-rays, and there-
fore higher doses of radiation,
to penetrate the bone..
She added that children and
young adults are at the highest
risk from radiation, while the

risk is less in adults and mini-
mal in older adults aged 30 to
40.
"Those with the highest risk
for any potential downstream
cancer tend to be very young,"
Kazerooni said. "Our efforts here
in our children's and women's
hospital have been very rigorous
in the last seven years to mini-
mize the radiation from the CTs
to children in particular."
Kazerooni said UMHS plans
to add Veo computers to all of its
CT scanners and has requested
these units from General Elec-
tric.
Looking forward, Fes-
sler said he plans to continue
working on Veo technology to
improve its speed in generating
images so that it can be used on
all patients in the future.
"We're continuingtowork on
faster algorithms, and we hope
the next generation of this tech-
nology will be fast enough that
it will only take as long as the
scan itself - maybe a minute or
two - and then it could be used
on every patient for every scan."

Action over optimism
Business leaders' plan should reflect reality
Michigan needs more than an idealistic plan to revitalize
the state's economy if the current trend of positive change
is to be expected to continue. The Business Leaders for
Michigan, a group of the state's business elites including University
President Mary Sue Coleman, formed a list of goals that set to create
jobs and bolster the economy. Included in its plan is a prediction that
500,000 jobs could be created with an $18,000 per capita increase in
average income within 10 years. While this goal is admirable and the
group's enthusiasm is refreshing, it's unreasonable to expect that this
many jobs could be created in such a short amount of time without

government and business cooperati
Last Tuesday, the Business Leaders for
Michigan announced its 2012 Michigan Turn-
around Plan, which lists recommendations
for ways to improve Michigan's economy. The
plan focusesonsixideas: utilizingengineering
talent, capitalizing on Michigan's geographic
location, investing in higher education, tak-
ing advantage of natural resources, revital-
izing the automotive industry and developing
health and medical expertise.
Adding 500,000 new jobs to the state of
Michigan would be greatly beneficial to the
economy and would replace 60 percent of the
jobs lost in the past decade. It's unclear, how-
ever, who will pay for the investments needed
to make this goal a reality. Without a clear plan
of who will invest and take action to make this
happen, it can't be assumed that 500,000 jobs
will magically return to Michigan's economy.
Michigan ranks 39th in higher educa-
tion state support per student in the country.
Michigan must invest greatly in higher edu-
cation, as a degree is a necessity in order to
find a job its today's economy. Doug Rothwell,
CEO of the Business Leaders for Michigan,
predicts that by 2018, as much as 62 percent
of Michigan jobs will require post-secondary
education. The cost of college has been steadi-
ly increasing as a result of decreased state
funding. The government should put a stop to

tuition increases by undoing their 15 percent
divestment from public unversities to allow
more people the option of higher education.
While the hopeful creation of more jobs for
college graduates is beneficial for many peo-
ple, much of Michigan's economy is composed
of people who have not received a college
degree. Getting these workers employment
or training them for new work should also
be a priority. President Barack Obama has
proposed serious incentives for companies
to build manufacturing facilities to hard-hit
areas. Investing in the factories of Flint and
Investing in the factories of Flint and Detroit
is vital in order for Michigan's economic
revival.
The Business Leaders for Michigan's plan is
a worthy plan for businesses, the government
and citizens to follow. However, some of the
goals in this plan, while idealistic, are imprac-
tical without definite funding. The govern-
ment needs to invest in higher education,
businesses and jobs for non-college graduates
to bring Michigan to its full potential. It boils
down to less talk and more action from every-
one involved.
Michigan's government should explore
the business leaders' recommendations while
remembering that all residents must work
together toput the state on the right path.

Ct de dnde ees?"
Desperate to retain an
air of experience, I felt my
face crimson and
my hands damp-
en as I sputtered
out incoherent .
Spanish babble.
It was like my
first time all
over again.
"Soy ... soy ...
estadounidense." MELANIE
And there it KRUVELIS
was, the admis-
sion, where I'm
from. Iam an American.
You would think after three
semesters of drooling through Span-
ish class, I would at least possess the
capabilityto identifymyself. Afterall,
with a haircut a la Ellen DeGeneres
and a demeanor a la Larry the Cable
Guy, my nationality practically leaps
out of me and into a bi-curious Texas
Roadhouse. And yet, two weeks into
my semester abroad, I found myself
struggling to spit out the most basic
phrases to the poor madrileno who
dared to ask.
But it wasn't as if I didn't know
the vocabulary. Hell, telling some-
one I was from the States was just
about the only phrase I bothered to
memorize on the flight, aside from
"where exactly does it itch?"
I knew the question. I knew the
answer. For once, I was prepared.
What I wasn't prepared for was
the apparent shame in admitting
my citizenship. Behind the lexical
blunders, the linguistic faux pas
and the really sweaty palms, behind
all that was a red-faced American
who couldn't bear to reveal her
nationality. And apparently needed
stronger antiperspirant.
Being an American had never
really been a point of pride for me
prior to leaving the country, but it

certainly wasn't a point of shame
either. To be honest, I hadn't really
given it much thought. I knew how
to point out my hometown on a
palm. I could croak out the national
anthem, and I think I saw a com-
mercial for NASCAR once. In other
words, I was just about as Ameri-
can as a bleeding heart who prefers
Ricky Gervais over Steve Carell
could get.
And I thought nothing of it.
But then I stepped off of my
international flight. I hailed a
hybrid taxi. I confused a bidet for
a verne Troyer-sized drinking
fountain. And as I sat back in that
cab, I started to wonder, why was I
from the U.S.? I mean, yes, I know.
Because of some unfortunate inci-
dent in the handicap bathroom of
a K-mart in Flint some 19 odd years
ago. But after nearly two decades
of taking up space in the States, I
had never considered what my life
would be like outside of America.
Or if some other country might be
better for me. But now I was start-
ing to wonder why.
It's not just me getting the red,
white and blues. Whether or not
they realize it, other American
students I've encountered while
studying abroad seem to echo the
same shame when speaking of their
American-ocity.
"I don't really want to travel
with some big American group, you
know?" "Last night I totally con-
vinced some guys that I was Ger-
man." "Hey, DeGeneres, would you
please stop eavesdropping?"
At first I thought maybe they just
didn't want to come across as tour-
ists, but as the days go by it becomes
more apparent that feigning a dif-
ferent nationality is preferable to
pulling out a U.S. passport. It's got-
ten to the point where American has
become a pseudo-insult, as in, "Is

this too American?" "She's so obvi-
ously American." "Does this Ameri-
can make my America look big?"
I guess it's hard not to get sucked
into the European way of life. In
Spain, the kids can drink, the gays
can marry and the prostitutes can
take business when they please.
Oh, and everyone's as high as a
drunk, gay-friendly whore of a kite.
And I know, for the average Ann
Arborite there's hardly any differ-
ence between Europe and a visit
to the People's Food Co-op. But
what about for the rest of the coun-
try outside our 27 square miles of
socialism and hairy legs? Well, it's
like Disney World without the price
of admission.
Forgive and
forget. But mostly
just forget.
Sowhat's anAmerican, bespecta-
cled curmudgeon to do? Renounce
all American connections? Start
humping The Communist Mani-
festo? Take up space with a mess of
rhetorical questions? The best I've
got so far is to adapt and find ways
to fit my American habits within
the Euro-lifestyle.
Or better yet, just come clean.
Yes, I'm American. Yes, my coun-
try still forbids marriage rights to
about four million citizens. And
yes, we still have a death penalty.
There may be shame, but I prom-
ise, there's always more alcohol.
So drink and be merry. Forgive and
forget. But mostly just forget.

Students across Ann Arbor were collecting
around their televisions or inside Al Glick Field
House, watching President Barack Obama
inject hopes and dreams into the minds of
Americans everywhere (only because of Uni-
versity President Mary Sue Coleman's letter
to him, and the fact that Michigan is a swing
state, but that's a different .story). While the
president spoke, many were ignoring a very
important development concerning the past,
one that may shape the future of the world.
On Dec. 22, the lower house of the French
Parliament passed a bill that would make it
an offense to deny that the Armenian geno-
cide by the Turks took place in 1915. On Jan.
23, the bill passed the French Senate, effec-
tively making it law. This development comes
on the heels of a tense relationship between
Turkey and France, and resulted in the two
countries severing diplomatic relations. The
denial of the Armenian genocide is one of the
sticking points.
When Turkey was still the Islamic Otto-
man Empire, fighting alongside the Central
Powers in World War I, they marched over
more than 1 million Christian Armenians into
the desert, a crime on par with the Holocaust:
Resolutely, however, the present-day secular
Turkish nation refuses to acknowledge the
heinous act. Where the Germans have made it
illegal to deny the Holocaust, the Turks have
locked up their skeletons.
France has quite a bit of influence, espe-
cially when it comes to the European Union.
The -EU's position has weakened recently -
financial crises in Greece, Spain, Ireland and
most all countries not named Germany have

cut at the core of its economic strength. But
by making it illegal to deny the Armenian
genocide, France has effectively blocked one
of the most economically dynamic nations
from the EU.
Despite its best efforts to hide it, the EU is
a dying organization. It can no longer hold on
to its members, and internationally, countries
such as Brazil, China and India are shaping
the future. Turkey is a new and emerging
power in the Middle East. More importantly,
it is a new secular power in the Middle East.
The West needs to make friends with Turkey.
Let's face it. Iran doesn't like us very much.
Neither does Saudi Arabia - they only are
nice to us because we pay them a lot. Once we
(hopefully) need less foreign oil, the Middle
East will have no reason to play ball with us.
That's a lot of people against the U.S. But if the
EU would be so kind as to let Turkey in and
establish a power base in the Middle East, the
West might have a say in the events that hap-
pen there.
France is coming from a place of high
morals and is conveniently ignoring what
happened during the Algerian War of Inde-
pendence. France has a worthy sentiment,
but, especially in light of its recent credit
downgrade, it can't afford to pick and choose
its allies. None of Europe can.
Obama, in an election year, projected a mes-
sage of hope without any real feasible plan for
the future. Sarkozy, in an election year, gave
a clear plan, but does not project any hope for
the future. Which is worse?
Nirbhayilain is an LSA freshman.

They say you'll never get the
right answers if you're ask-
ing the wrong question. It's
exactly the case
with education
today. I've seen
many adults
stand in front of
me -teachers,
administrators,
public service
employees and HARSHA
even College NAHATA
Board officials -
all with the same
concern: the decline of education
in the United States and the subse-
quent inability of American students
to stand out in a competitive global
marketplace.
The reason we aren't able to work
toward a viable solution is because
we aren't asking the right questions.
The debate currently focuses o why
kids don't get good grades and test
scores. People ask: Why aren't stu-
dents paying attention in school, why
aren't they making learning a prior-
ity or why aren't they absorbing the
information presented to them?
We never ask, however, why
aren't students interested in school?
We never ask, what else is going on
to detract from focus on their edu-.
cation?
We never ask why staring at
a computer screen reading 540
of your Facebook friends' status
updates is more interesting than
learning how the world around you
functions. Why watching YouTube
clips of people embarrassing them-
selves is more appealingthan learn-
ing skills to help sustain yourself
for the rest of your life.
With the amount of things vying

for a student's attention these days
- Facebook, YouTube, Iwasteso-
muchtime.com and the list goes on
- education must be not only inter-
esting, but captivating enough to
hold a person's attention.
When you start asking these
questions, the answer becomes
clearer. All these distractions are
designed to be entertaining. Mil-
lions of dollars are poured into
creating a product people want to
consume, a product that fascinates
people, a product that keeps them
coming back again and again.
These are products that are
designed to solicit and earn people's
attention, and they keep adapting
accordingly. If a game or movie is
boring, it fails. Simple - people just
don't buy it and move on to the next
thing. This, in turn, forces com-
panies to keep innovating, to keep
investing in the new.
Yet, in education - something so
important to an individual's future
- why aren't classes held to the
same expectations? At a university
where students are paying hundreds
of dollars for each hour they sit in
class, why aren't lecturers expected
to make the content interesting at
the least, if not engaging. Professors
must now compete with technology
for their students' attention.
Unless the professor is present-
ing information in a way that makes
students want to listen instead of
text their friends, play Temple Run
on their smartphone or Facebook
stalk the girl they met last night,
people aren't going to pay attention.
It isn't enough for teachers to
walk into a room, read off of a Pow-
erPoint and expect to have the full
attention of their audience. Yes, it's

admirable to be an expert in a par-
ticular subject or to have a Ph.D.
from a top-ranking university, but
until a professor or teacher is able
to take their information and pres-
ent it in a way that holds people's
attention and conveys why it's is
useful to them, they won't be effec-
tive teachers.
And students will continue to
struggle.
Education has

to become more
engaging.

There was a time when even if

Polished 'Mirrors

Gotye reinvents
pop on most
recent effort
By EDITH FREYER
Daily Arts Writer
Chances are that by now,
you've seen the music video for
Gotye's "Somebody That I Used
to Know." With
upwards of 54
million views
on YouTube, Gotye
the video fea-
tures the Aus- Making Mirrors

the New Zea- Eleven
land native
Kimbra morphing into human
paintings who spar with a strik-
ing sense of self-control and.
detachment. Watch for yourself
- it's not hard to see why. it's so
popular.
As it turns out, Gotye's newly
released third studio album,
Making Mirrors, completely
lives up to the hype created by
the online sensation. Absorbed
at once, the 12-song collection
is a gorgebuslyt unsettling mas-
terpiece, yet each of the songs-
is strong enough to stand alone.
With Making Mirrors, Gotye
(pronounced "gaut-yay") is rap-

idly distinguishing himself as
messenger for a new hind of pop
music, one less exclusively "club-
ish."
Also known as Wally De Back-
er, the 31-year-old produced all
of the album's songs himself -
no small feat, considering the
expanse of subgenres the album
covers. His awesome expertise as
a mixer brings each of the tracks
from solid to phenomenal.
Making Mirrors opens with
the title track, a minute-long
venture filled with mellow brass
and digital-sounding vocals. It's
markedly subdued - simplicity
is key here, and that pattern con-
tinues until the final song. It's an
enigmatic start to the album.
"Easy Way Out" is enjoy-
ably reminiscent of The Beatles'
"Day Tripper," and it transitions
effortlessly into the aforemen-
tioned "Somebody That I Used
to Know," an explosive song that,
amid teetering xylophone plunks
and soaring harmonies, cen-
ters around the story of a pain-
ful break-up - a seemingly trite
topic, which Gotye presents as
something ultimately unusual,
and it works.
Next-up is 'EyesWide Open,'
a high-powered groove that reaf-
firms Gotye's vocal strength. It
churns with an energy that feels
soaked in desperation and ten-

sion. "I Feel Better" steers the
album in a much lighter direc-
tion - Motown influenced with
a percussive twist, it's the point
in Making Mirrors when the
breadth of Gotye's versatility
starts to become obvious.
Aside from "Somebody That
I Used to Know," the album's
greatest highlight is "State of
the Art," a song filled with a pro-
found sense of humor. It includes
Gotye processed through a voice
changer, and a resounding, reg-
gae bassline. It's straightforward
but riveting.
Making Mirrors ends on a
sentimental note with "Bronte,"
a soothing ballad with soulful
undertones. Contrasting well
against Gotye's easy falsetto, it's
a beautiful finish.
This album has some major
staying power, and not just
because it touches on so many
moods. This stuff could be good
to study to, to dance to, to wind
down to - you get the picture.
Not to mention, Gotye has
figured out how to make atten-
tion-grabbing, dynamic pop
music without all the bells and
whistles. It's sincere but substan-
tial, and he's the only person out
there right now doing it this well.
If pop music really is headed in
Gotye's direction, the future is
bright.

A couple times a month, I
find myself returning to
a book that never man-
ages to leave my bedside. Bill
Brewster and Frank Boughton's
"Last Nighta

Life" is one of
many paper-
backs I've

over the last,
four years.
It's an engag- JOE

introduction
to the history
of DJs and dance music that's
cleanly written and compre-
hensive. I haven't "finished" it
because I find myself constantly
re-reading specific sections and
whole chapters of it - picking
out storied tracks to listen to and
DJs to research. Itake it on bus
rides and trips to the bathroom
and I leave it jostling around my
backpack for whole semesters.
Asa fan of disco music, it's a
handy general reference for the
genre's genesis and demise. I've
supplemented that history with
more specific books, such as
Peter Shapiro's immensely read-
able "Turn the Beat Around"
(which I finished in a day), Alice
Echol's "Hot Stuff" and the
biblical "Disco Files" by Vince
Aletti. ButI constantly return to
one particular segment of "Last
Night" that is more relevant
today than ever. The particular
segment details the history of
the 12-inch single.
"To date the 12-inch is the only
format of recorded music intro-
duced asa result of consumer
demand rather than record com-
pany marketing guile," Brewster
and Boughton write, concluding
their account of the format's con-
ception. It's a progressive innova-
tion that, as-they note, "happened
quite by accident."

'Le Havre' paints rosy
picture of humanity

Devilish'Dustforce' delights

By SEAN CZARNECKI
DailyArts Writer
"Le Havre" is not a story about
a man's triumph over adversity
- this is the chapter after he has
already failed.
Yet through
it all, he still
strives to be Le Havre
as good a man
as he has ever At the
been. Michigan
Marcel
Marx (Andr6 Future
Wilms, "Amer-
icano") leads a quaint, albeit fru-
gal, life as an elderly shoeshiner
in the port city of Le Havre.
Whatever little bits and pieces
of money he manages to earn
are stored in a sorry-looking tin
box by his wife Arletty, (Kati
Outinen, "The House of Branch-
ing Love") who is later diagnosed
with cancer. Marcel has nothing
to give, yet when he comes across
an illegal refugee named Idrissa
(played by newcomer Blondin
Miguel) in Le Havre's harbor, he
extends a helping hand.
If only the world was as good
as the one portrayed in "Le
Havre." Wherever director Aki
Kaurismiki chooses to take the
film's audience, whatever accor-
dion-filled corner his characters
inhabit, it's often a warm and
charming place. Such unrealism
and naive optimism is generally
unwelcome in a pragmatic world.

While the calendar for major
game releases at the beginning
of the year is rather barren, small
independent
games are still
coming out at a
regular clip to Dustforce
make up for it.
"Dustforce," a PC
downloadable
2-D platformer HitbtuTeam
that came out
this month, is one such game.
"Dustforce" has an odd prem-
ise. Players control a cleaner
tasked with gathering leaves
scattered about a level. This is
accomplished by simply going to
where the leaves are and running
over them. Instead of merely
moving from point A to point B as
in most platformers, "Dustforce"
has the player move all over the
level while trying to clean as
many leaves as quickly as pos-
sible. The leaves in the level are
laid out in such a way that players
with enough skill can clear them
in one, smooth run. It's essen-
tially a game of finding the most
efficient path to run over all the
leaves.
Each level tends to be on the
shorter side, encouraging play-
ers to make repeat attempts to
get the perfect run. At the end of
each level players are graded on
how many leaves they cleaned up
and how quickly they did it with-
out dying or messing up. Earning
a high grade in both categories
yields keys to unlock more dif-
ficult levels. There is also a lead-
erboard for each level to compare
how well (or terribly) you did
against others who have played
the same level.
This premise sounds like it
could get pretty boring if the
platforming was cut and dry, in
the "Mario" vein of only running
and jumping. However, the plat-
forming controls are complex,

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
Forgive Michigan hockey
coach Red Berengofi if he reacts
more intensely than normal
when senior forward David
Wohlberg gets injured.
The alternate captain has a
history of upper-body injuries,
such as the one he suffered to
his collarbone in March of last
year that sidelined him for the
remainder of the postseason.
"You just hope that he has
better luck this year than he had
last year," Berenson said. "But
this has been his best, healthiest
year."
The team held its collective
breath when Wohlberg went
down after colliding with a
teammate on Thursday. And
with his right arm in a sling,
potentially an indication of- a
collarbone injury, there was
absolutely a cause for concern.
But Berenson never disclosed
exactly how Wohlberg was
injured.
Berenson did offer up a posi-
tive prognosis for his quiet lead-
er on Monday. Though Wohlberg
continues to be day-to-day, he is
expected to skate in practice on
Tuesday.
"We'll see how he feels tomor-
row, but the direction is good
right now," Berenson said.
The Wolverines can thank
their lucky stars that the bye
week came when it did.
The stretch run begins now,
and playing without one of its
most experienced skaters isn't
something Michigan wants to
do.
The three days of practice
Wohlberg has missed weren't
any quieter without him on the
ice. He isn't going to be the one
barking but instructions or giv-
ing a teammate in earful for a
missed assignment.
But he's the one that under-
classmen see still going full
speed during drills the team's
done thousands of times.
Captain Luke Glendening
might be the most vocal among

the seniors, but having too many
of those leaders could be detri-
mental - they'll inevitably butt
heads. And that's why having a
player like Wohlberg is so valu-
able. He's the quintessential
leader by example and it's no
coincidence that he's playing on
the Wolverines' most prolific
line.
"That line (of Wohlberg,
freshmanAlexGuptill and junior
Chris Brown) has been huge for
our team," Berenson said. "And
(Wohlberg's) a key player on all
of the special tears."
But Glendening and senior
defenseman Greg Pateryn are
hesitant to say that practice has
a different feel without Wohl-
berg. Sure, a presence between
the circles is missing,. butt theF
team hasn't missed a beat. You
might not be able to replace a
player like Wohlberg, but the
other leaders can pick up the

slack.
"It's a little different, but we
need to keep moving forward,"
Glendening said. "I think it's just
everyone has to step up a little
bit. If everyone does a little bit,
it makes up for alot."
Pateryn shares a similar sen-
timent. He knows it's key to have
Wohlberg playing his best down
the stretch.
And having him healthy is a
luxury the Wolverines missed
out on last season.
"He's making something hap-
pen every shift, and I think alot
of guys look up to him for that,"
Pateryn said.
Different types of leaders
present different challenges for
opponents. And having Wohl-
berg - who's been playing some
of the best hockey of his career
- on the ice this weekend would
be a tremendous boost for Mich-
igan.

Student-athletes put on 14th-annual Mock Rock

In 2010, event
raised $86,000 for
several charities
By MICHELLE McMAHON
For the Daily
"I got to flaunt a hot pink
bikini in front of thousands of
people," said Michigan hockey
sophomore Mac Bennett, captur-
ing the essence of Mock Rock in
so many words.
The University of Michigan
Student-Athlete Advisory Com-
mittee will host the 14th-annu-
al Mock Rock fundraiser next
Tuesday at Hill Auditorium.
Mock Rock is a high-energy
variety show featuring various
entertaining skits and dance
routines that display the student-
athletes' creative skills off the
court, arena or field.
"It's all in good fun and for a
great cause," Bennett said.

The event was created to com-
memorate the tragic passing of
Michigan wrestler Jeff Reese in
1997 by.Reese's fellow student-
athletes. The event's proceeds
went to the scholarship fund
which bears his name.
Mock Rock 2012 will continue
the tradition of raising money
for those in need. The student-
athletes are striving to raise
$100,000 to give back to three
different causes this year: Mott
Children's Hospital, Big Brothers
Big Sisters of Washtenaw County
and Student-Athletes Leading
Social Change (SALSC)., Last
year's event grossed a record
high of $86,000, which went to a
selection of causes, including the
Mott Children's Hospital.
"As a student-athlete, it is an
honor to continue a tradition
that was started well before we
got here and to make it into a
legacy," said Erik Braun, Senior
President of SAAC and a member
of the men's track and field team.

"I'm grateful to have supported
and been a part of such a special
event."
Michigan welcomes back
alum and ESPN anchorwoman
Dana Jacobson as Master of Cer-
emonies to accompany a panel of
judges.
Junior football defensive end
Craig Roh is excited for his skit.
"I'm mostly looking forward
to doing our performance," Roh
said.
"We're combining with the
volleyball team this year and
we've spent a lot of time and
effort putting this together to
make it a unique routine for such
a great cause. It's a mixture of
talent, poise, and extreme ath-
leticism that will comprise our
skit."
Bennett gave a sneak peek into
the hockey team's performance
this year.

Horford's season in question

By BEN ESTES
Daily Sports Editor
To say the last month-and-a-
half has been a frustrating time
for Michigan forward Jon Hor-
ford would be an understate-
ment.
The sophomore has not
played a game since Dec. 10 due
to a stress frac-
ture in the fifth NOTEBOOK
metatarsal
bone in his right foot.
For a while, Horford's injury
didn't seem to be that serious,
and most didn't expect that he'd
still be sitting so long after the
injury first came to light. Hor-
ford actually played through
pain in the win over Oakland
at the Palace of Auburn Hills -
Michigan coach John Beilein
revealed that he sustained a
"stress area" in his foot after the
game against Iowa State a week
before.
At the time, Beilein said he
would rest Horford to prevent
the relatively minor injury
from becoming something more
serious. Considering the then-
20th-ranked Wolverines were
facing a pretty breezy three-
game stretch of mid-major
opponents before opening the
Big Ten season, Beilein's deci-
sion seemed natural.
But then Horford didn't play
against Penn State in the con-
ference opener, and Beilein
announced that Horford was
"week-to-week." A medical
redshirt became a legitimate
option, pending an MRI.
That MRI didn't reveal fur-
ther damage, but an X-ray a
couple weeks later showed that
Horford indeed had a stress
fracture in the metatarsal, put-
ting a potential return this sea-
son even further in doubt. While
he hasn't traveled to several of
Michigan's road games, Horford
did make the trip to Columbus
on Sunday in street clothes. He
said he's been frustrated having
to sit out.
"But that's life, and my team-
mates have been real supportive
of me," Horford said. "It's been
hard, it's always hard when you
can't play. Everyone's been help-
ing me stay up, and hopefully
in the near future I can be 100
percent."
In recent weeks, Beilein has
given periodic updates on Hor-
ford's status. First, he was doing

rehab work on his own. Then, he
came back to practice doing only
some of the activities. He finally
resumed practicing full-go last
week, but Beilein said he was
rusty and wouldn't play until
he got back to full health. It's
unclear if that will happen soon.
Considering Horford still
hasn't played, and since Michi-
gan (6-3 Big Ten, 16-6 overall)
has just nine regular-season
games remaining, it appears
more and more likely that Hor-
ford will sit the rest of the year
and take a redshirt.
The move would have several
advantages. For one, it would
break up the sophomore class,
which has four other players.
The departure of five players
two years from now would hurt
roster continuity. It would also
help space out the big men on
the roster, as one of his class-
mates is redshirt sophomore
Jordan Morgan.
And Horford would have an
extra year of eligibility, mean-
ing this wouldn't be a wasted
season.
But on the flip side, the Wol-
verines are hurting for depth,
especially in the frontcourt.
Sophomore forward Evan
Smotrycz is much more natural
as a "4" man but has been forced
to take the backup center role.
And while Morgan has done a

better job of avoiding foul trou-
ble this season, he's still liable to
slip up. When he and Smotrycz
both pick up too many fouls - as
was the case against then-No.
4 Ohio State and its burly front
line on Sunday - the team's
frontcourt depth issues become
obvious. Junior forward Blake
McLimans is the next option,
but he doesn't have the physical-
ity to battle down low like Mor-
gan or Horford.
Beilein has an important
decision to make: try to get by
without Horford this season, or
bring him back and essentially
sacrifice his sophomore year for
a better chance at a strong finish
in the stretch.
"You always want to be out
there," Horford said. "You want
to be able to help your team. I
feel like the only way I can con-
tribute now is try to pick these
guys up when they come out of
the game in timeouts."
HOKE-INFLUENCED?: It
wasn't easy to notice, but in the
run-up to the tilt with the Buck-
eyes, Beilein began to refer to
the university simply as "Ohio,"
adopting the jargon popular-
ized by Michigan football coach
Brady Hoke.
Beilein continued to omit the
"State" in his press conference
after the game and in the Big
Ten Coaches' teleconference on

Monday. But he clams the lin-
guistic decision is all his own.
"I can't tell you how it's hap-
pened, it's just sort of happened
with (the football saying) 'Beat
Ohio,' " Beilein said. "I have
received no direction from
anybody. I've just adopted that
myself. But there's some unifor-
mity with what Brady's doing."
IZZO PRAISES BURKE: After
the Wolverines' 60-59 win over
then-No. 9 Michigan State on
Jan. 17, Spartans head man
Tom Izzo was reticent to praise
Michigan freshman point guard
Trey Burke.
Perhaps you can chalk it up
to Izzo being disappointed with
the loss, because he was much
more open about Burke on Mon-
day.
"I think he has (surprised),"
Izzo said. "He wasn't a top
recruit coming out (of high
school). He just kind of fits what
they do. He's done a good job
and is a very, very, very good
offensive player. He can do a lot
with the ball, uses balls screens
pretty well and shoots it very
well."
Izzo also praised Indiana
freshman forward Cody Zeller
for his contributions as a first-
year player. Michigan welcomes
Zeller and the 20th-ranked
Hoosiers to the Crisler Center
on Wednesday night.

The season has been over for
nearly a month, but" the hard-
ware keeps rolling in for Team
132. The Maxwell Football Club
named Michigan coach Brady
Hoke as its Collegiate Coach of
the Year on Monday.
The award is Hoke's third
this season. The first-year coach
earned Big Ten Coach of the Year
honors from both the coaches
and the media. He was also a
finalist for three other national
Coach of the Year honors.
"Coach Hoke has engineered
a tremendous turnaround in the
Michigan football program in
just one year, and it was obvi-
ous that his team improved
each week," said Mark Wolpert,
executive director of Maxwell
Football Club. "It is quite an
accomplishment to compile an
11-2 record playing a rigorous Big
Ten schedule in his first year at
the helm. Coach Hoke has set the
tone for a high degree of future
success for the Michigan pro-
gram."
Established in 1935, the Max-
well Football Club is the oldest
football club in the nation and
has named a collegiate coach of
the year since 1989. The award

was named the Joseph V. Pater-
nlo Collegiate Coach of the Year
Award for one year until the
Maxwell Club removed the name
in November of 2011.
Along with the award, Hoke
received an invite to the 75th
Maxwell Club National Awards
Gala, which will be held at the
Harrah's Atlantic City Resort
on Friday, March 2. Green Bay
Packers quarterback Aaron Rod-
gers, coach Mike McCarthy, LSU
cornerback Tyrann Mathieu and
Stanford quarterback Andrew
Luck, among others, will also
receive awards.
"(Hoke)
engineered a
tremendous
turnaround."
Hoke compiled an 11-2 record
(6-2 Big Ten) in his first year at
the helm, and with a victory
in the Allstate Sugar Bowl, he
became the third coach to win a
BCS bowl in his first season in a
new program.
