Ann Arbor police
continue to follow
up on 600 tips
By ANT MITCHELL
Daily StaffReporter
After the 'string of sexual
assaults in Ann Arbor this sum-
mer, police are still on the hunt
for one or more perpetrators.
Six assaults - four of which
were sexual assaults, including

two rapes - occurred in park-
ing garages and on streets near
campus throughout July. The
incidents drew national media
attention, and the Ann Arbor
Police Department called upon
the FBI for assistance in the
investigation. However, since
July there have not been any
assaults with suspects that
match the descriptions of the
suspect(s) in July.
Ann Arbor Police Chief Bar-
nett Jones said in a talk with

In Labor Day visit,

By BETHANY BIRON
Daily News Editor
DETROIT - On an unusual-
ly chilly September afternoon
yesterday, President Barack
Obama delivered a Labor Day

address at the Renaissance
Center here, emphasizing the
importance of bipartisanship
in determining policy to aug-
ment national employment and
strengthen the economy.
Obama's address precedes
his scheduled speech to Con-
gress on Thursday regard-
ing upcoming initiatives for
job improvement. His visit to
Detroit also follows a Sept.
2 report from the U.S. Labor

Department declaring a
national net job change of zero
for the first time since 1945.
The event began with a per-
formance by Aretha Frank-
lin, the "Queen of Soul," who
energized the shi-vering audi-
ence with soulful renditions
of her classic hits. Franklin
was followed by speeches from
Michigan AFL-CIO President
Mark Gaffney, U.S. Secretary
of Labor Hilda Solis and United

Auto Workers member Gha-
man Goodwin-Die.
Obama began his address by
thanking those in attendance
for striving to improve the
prosperity of the city of Detroit
and the nation amid a difficult
economic period. The open-
ing was immediately followed
by exuberant chants from the
crowd cheering "Four more
years!" and waving posters that

SMOKE-FREE INITIATIVE
Administrators expect a smooth
transition to smoke-free campus

OSCR to handle
complaints for
ban violations
By KAITLIN WILLIAMS
Daily StaffReporter
Students and faculty returning
to campus this week may find the
air abit fresher.
More than two months after
the implementation of a campus-

wide smoking ban, which went
into effect July 1, thousands of
students have returned to a clean-
er campus atmosphere. Despite
the change, University officials
say they think students will easily
adapt to the new policy, and vio-
lations of the ban will be handled
smoothly.
Robert Winfield, co-chair of
the Smoke-Free University Steer-
ing Committee, the University's
chief health officer and direc-
tor of University Health Service,

said that while the smoking ban
took effect this summer, the full
impact of the initiative won't be
felt until students and faculty set-
tle in for the fall semester.
In May 2010, Michigan also
instated a smoking ban in public
places such as restaurants and
bars. Since the push to reduce
public smoking has been made at
the state and locallevels, Winfield
said he thinks the University's
ban will be effective in helping

'U' to now pay city
of Ann Arbor for
traffic services
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
Daily StaffReporter
Football Saturday traffic this
fall might be worse than in pre-
vious seasons.

A new agreement between the
city of Ann Arbor and the Uni-
versity will reduce the amount
of traffic services the city pro-
vides on game days, increasing
the potential of congestion on
the roads. The decreased ser-
vices come into effect as the
University is now required, as
per an Ann Arbor City Council
resolution, to reimburse the city

for traffic management services
provided on game days and at
other special events, according
to an Aug. 26 City of Ann Arbor
press release.
The "Signs and Signals"
agreement came after the City
Council unanimously passedthe
resolution requiringhe Uniy
sity to compensat the city O

10 years ago this week:
(Sept. 5, 2001) - For the
first time in the Michigan
Marching Band's history, a
woman led the hand onto the
field as Drum Major.
Before Michigan heat
Miami (Ohio) 31-13 in their
season opener on Sept. 3,
LSA senior Karen England
performed the traditional
backbend as the hand played
"the Victors" behind her.
"I looked up and saw my
face on the big screen and
I was thinking, 'I'm finally
here, leading the best band in
the country,"' England told
The Michigan Daily at the
time. "I heard the crowd go

wild and up until that point,
I didn't know the crowd was
there."
25 years ago this week:
(Sept. 5, 1986) - "Looks of
Class," the first women of
Michigan calendar, hit the
stands in Ann Arbor stores.
The calendar was created
by three female students
who rallied their friends
to pose in front of campus
landmarks like Michigan
Stadium. Despite the group's
enthusiasm, some students
like LSA junior Nancy Peter-
man didn't think the calen-
dar was worth purchasing.
"I wouldn't buy it," Peter-
man said at the time. "I'll get

the men's calendar."
40 years ago this week:
(Sept. 10, 1971) - Much
to the dismay of the Ann .
Arbor Public School's 2,000 y.
students, the Ann Arbor
teacher's union ended
its week-long strike and
returned to work.
The teachers ended their
strike pending further nego-
tiations with the district
administration.
The main disagreements
between the administration
and the teachers centered
around class size and salary.

OBAMA
From Page 1A
read "Let America Work: Good
Jobs Now!"
"I am honored, we are hon-
ored, to spend the day with you
and your families, the working
men and women of America,"
Obama told the crowd. "You
deserve a little R&R, a little bar-
beque, (a) little grilling, because
you've been working hard."
He continued by highlighting
the initiatives of his administra-
tion to improve the quality of life
for "the greatest middle class the
world has ever known," including
tax breaks for the working class,
affordable health care and educa-
tion reform.
"Everything we've done, it's
been thinking about you," Obama
said. "We said working folks
deserved a break - so within
one month of me taking office,
we signed into law the biggest
middle-class tax cut in history,
putting more money into your
pockets."
Obama acknowledged the
strain unemployment has inflict-
ed upon countless citizens and
reaffirmed his quest to help the

nation rise above the recession as
thousands of American citizens
continue to seek employment.
"These are tough times for
working Americans," Obama
said. "They're even tougher for
Americans who are looking for
work - and a lot of them have
been looking for work for a long
time. A lot of folks have been
looking for work for a long time
here in Detroit, and all across
Michigan, and all across the Mid-
west, and all across the country.
So we've got alot more work to do
to recover fully from this reces-
sion."
While Obama didn't delve into
the contents of his Congressional
speech on Thursday, he did note
plans to launch major infrastruc-
ture projects that would improve
the quality of the nation's roads
and employ up to a million
workers. He noted that the proj-
ects require compromises from
both parties and bipartisanship
efforts.
"We've got roads and bridges
across this country that need
rebuilding," Obama said. "We've
got private companies with the
equipment and the manpower to
do the building. We've got more
than 1 million unemployed con-

struction workers ready to get turning a profit and hiring new
dirty right now. There is work to workers and building the best
be done and there are workers cars in the world right here in
ready to do it. Labor is on board. Detroit, right here in the Mid-
Business is on board. We just west, right here in the United
need Congress to get on board. States of America."
Let's put America back to work." Obama concluded by discuss-
ing the city's quest to reinvigo-
rate and develop a new identity
despite its hardships. He pointed
'There is work to initiatives made by the "Strong
to be done Cities, Strong Communities"
program in which the Obama

and that if Obama acts on his pro-
posed initiatives, they will dem-

re-election.
"This is Detroit, and he gave
a speech that Detroit wanted to
hear," Burcar said. "Now let's
hope he takes that same senti-
ment back to Washington, and
actually works for us and get's
behind us so that we stay behind
him."
Nicholson said he was glad to
hear Obama discuss the impor-
tance of ensuring equality among
people in high-paying business
positions and employees in more
blue collar workforces. He added
that it should be an initiative of
schools like the University's Ross
School of Business to educate
students on the importance of
tolerance and respect for those in
working class positions.
"Business schools, including
(the University), where my sis-
ter went and got her MBA, need
to address morals and the social
conscious of their students when
they turn them out," Nicholson
said. "You can't just have $32 mil-
lion because you say you're 700
times better than the man work-
ing on the floor."

Public Policy junior Andrea
Schafer was among the masses at
yesterday's speech and said she
was inspired by Obama mention-
ing the role of young people to
help revive Detroit. It reminded
her of programs like the Universi-
ty's Semester in Detroit in which
students work toward the "beau-
tification and revamping of the
city," she said.
"I'm happy as a young person
that we were recognized because
a lot of the speakers talked about
how powerful the youth's vote
and youth's momentum can be,"
Schafer said. "It was nice to be
recognized, and I think D.C.
needs to realize that we're a force
to be reckoned with, so people
should be fighting for what we
want too."
She added that she found the
speech to be more a form of "reas-
surance" rather than a call to
action.
"It was very empowering,"
Schafer said. "He addressed a lot
of concerns of the middle class
and workers in the public sector,
and I think he assured them that
there are good people in D.C. who
are still fighting for them, who
are fighting for us and who are
fighting for the middle class."


ASSAULTS
From Page 1A
The Michigan Daily on Friday
that despite the time lapse, the
department is continuing to do
all it can - including working
with other police forces - to find
theassailant(s).
"The general assumption for
some people is, 'He's no longer
(in Ann Arbor),"' Jones said. "We
can't assume that.. I want him to
still be here because then we can
catch him."
The first sexual assault on July
15, in which the survivor escaped,
occurred near Community High
School on Division Street. A sec-
ond assault occurred a few hours
later on July 16 at about 2 a.m. on

Greenwood Avenue.
Another assault, in which a
woman was fondled, occurred on
July 26 on the 700 block of State
Street. There was an additional
assault on Aug. 18, though the
suspect's description is different
from that of the suspect(s) of the
sexual assaults in July. Police are
looking for a black male in his
50s in connection to the August
assault.
As students return to cam-
pus for the start of fall semester,
the AAPD and the University's
Department of Public Safety
have increased patrols on and
around campus.
DPS Executive Director Greg
O'Dell said at a press confer-
ence last month that DPS officers
would be making their presence

more known on campus.
"I'm a very big believer in
actively patrolling on foot, get-
ting the officers out of the cars
... That's something I want to
integrate throughout the depart-
ment," O'Dell said at the press
conference.
O'Dell, who was named DPS
executive director last month is
a former chief of police at East-
ern Michigan University, said he
implemented a program at EMU
that required officers to spend at
least one hour of their eight-hour
shift out of their cars. He added
that DPS and AAPD are working
closely to ensure student safety.
"I actually have officers who
are assigned now from the Uni-
versity of Michigan to the Ann
Arbor Police Department," he

said.
The AAPD has also rear-
ranged officers' schedules to
ensure that there are more uni-
formed officers on the street,
Jones said. Additionally, the
AAPD has received more than
600 tips from across the coun-
try regarding the identity of the
attacker.
Jones attributed the large
number of tips to the distribu-
tion of two composite images
of the assailant(s). Two images
were released because the survi-
vors gave varying descriptions of
their attacker(s).
"We're following up on every
tip because if I can impress one
thing on your mind today, we
want him," Jones said. "We all
want this person because he's

taken away the personal security
of the people in our community."
University and police officials
have encouraged students to
remain vigilant and to take cau-
tion, especially at night since all
of the assaults have occurred
between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m.
Last Friday, Jones and O'Dell
joined Holly Rider-Milkovich,
the director of the University's
Sexual Assault Prevention and
Awareness Center, Dean of Stu-
dents Laura Blake Jones and
student campus leaders as they
went door-to-door in off-campus
student neighborhoods to raise
awareness about safety.

Students return to smoke-free campus'

From Page 1A
people quit smoking.
"The social pressures and state
ordinances will influence people
to stop smoking," Winfield said.
With the implementation of the
Smoke-Free University Initiative,
the University became one of 530
universities with smoking bans,
according to a recent report from
the American Nonsmokers' Rights
Foundation.
The campus-wide ban has
already caused observable chang-
es - enrollment in Tobacco
Counseling Services at UHS has
increased since July, Winfield
said. In addition to counseling ser-
vices, TCS provides students, fac-
ulty and staff with free nicotine
patches and gum.
Winfield also noted that he
hasn't seen smokers outside his
office at UHS or near the side
entrance of the Michigan Union
like he did prior to the ban.
But even if people smoke on
campus, Jay Wilgus, director of
the Office of Student Conflict
Resolution, said the University's
Department of Public Safetywon't
hand out citations to students for
smoking. Instead, OSCR is respon-
sible for enforcing the ban by fol-
lowing up on complaints filed
against students smoking on Uni-
versity property.
Repercussions for not comply-
ing with the ban will follow the
same procedure as the other viola-
tions enumerated in the Statement
of Student Rights and Respon-
sibilities, Wilgus said. Once a

TRAFFIC
From Page lA
Police Department and the
city's Project Management unit
provide for game day traffic
control.
Under the terms of the
agreement, AAPD officers will
direct traffic at the intersec-
tion of Main Street and Sta-
dium Boulevard two hours
before football games begin.
After the game, Ann Arbor-
Saline Road will be converted
to a one-way road heading
south toward I-94 - a traffic
system that was instated in
previous years, according to a
Sept. 1 City of Ann Arbor press
release.
While the University has
agreed to pay the city for the
above services, it has forgone
several services the city previ-
ously provided. According to
the press release, the city will
no longer provide pre-game
traffic control or manual opera-
tion of traffic signals at busy
intersections such as the State
Street and Eisenhower Boule-
vard crossroads and the State
Street and Briarwood Drive
intersection.
However, these new condi-
tions will not be in place for
next Saturday's night game
against Notre Dame, when traf-
fic control will be heightened.
The University will pay the city
$12,000 for the traffic control

services, according to Univer-
sity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald.
Fitzgerald said though the
agreement has certain terms, it
doesn't completely exclude added
traffic control, if requested.
"The agreement provides
that the University can choose
to have additional services at
other home games as long as
we get the city notice of that,"
Fitzgerald said. "This is some-
thing we'll evaluate - the cost
versus the benefit of that - as
we move forward."
City officials saythat because
some services will no longer be
provided, traffic may become
congested at major intersec-
tions and freeway ramps on
game days. Despite this pos-
sible effect, City Council mem-
ber Sabra Briere (D-Ward 1)
said the services had become
a financial burden for the city
without the University's reim-
bursement.
"The ongoing argument has
been that the city benefits from
these events," Briere said. "It's
true to an extent, but what
doesn't benefit is the city's bud-
get."
Briere noted that the city,
like many other municipalities,
is striving to find ways to cut
spending.
"It's clear all around the
state (that) communities don't
have flexibility in their budgets
anymore," Briere said. "Now
we have reached the end of our
flexibility."

quarter, the attendance at Mich-
igan Stadium was zero. Knock
the play clock back one second
and the stands were packed with
a capacity crowd of 110,506.
The Big House had its founda-
tion shaken - literally - with
every clap of thunder. Bursts of
lightning lit up the turf better
than any of Dave Brandon's sta-
dium lighting, twice suspending
the game.
Everything was eerie, from
the sweltering heat at kickoff to
the first rain-shortened victory
in Michigan Stadium history.
Reports were that the field-
level temperature had skyrock-
eted near 130 degrees by kickoff.
The pregame show saw the
250-member Western Michigan
Marching Band performing in
white T-shirts and black shorts
- rather unfitting attire - after
a piccolo passed out in the tun-
nel due to the heat and humidity.
Strap on some shoulder pads
and the heat surely played a fac-
tor. But three hours later the
pads weren't drenched in sweat
but rain.
Hoke's opener with Michi-
gan's 132nd team was never
traditional.
If it had been, then Robinson

would have stepped under cen-
ter to take the first snap, turned
and handed the ball to halfback
Fitzgerald Toussaint busting
up the middle on a power run.
Instead, Robinson, in the shot-
gun, veered left and scampered
for an 11-yard gain.
Offensive coordinator Al
Borges dialing up a spread
offense-like quarterback run on
the first play was supposed to be
the biggest surprise of the day.
But two drives later, line-
backer Brandon Herron inter-
cepted a tipped pass from
Western Michigan quarterback
Alex Carder and rumbled all
the way downfield for a 94-yard
score. It was the longest inter-
ception return in Michigan
football's modern era and the
Wolverines' first interception
return for a touchdown since
Donovan Warren picked a
Ricky Stanzi pass against Iowa
in 2009.
In the Broncos' first drive of
the second half, Herron plucked
a loose ball off the turf and ran
for a 29-yard score. He hadn't
scored a touchdown since he
was a running back in eighth
grade - now he had two. In a
sense, he covered over twice as
much ground as Denard Robin-
son, 123 yards to 46.
In the opening minutes of the
third quarter, lightning forced

the officials at Michigan Sta-
dium to suspend play for just the
second time in program history
(The other being a game against
Central Michigan in 2006).
While the teams shuffled back
up toward the locker rooms, the
rain slowed and the sunshine
broke the clouds again. A rain-
bow stretched brilliantly over
the luxury suites on the sta-
dium's east side.
Lupe Fiasco's "The Show
Goes On" pounded through the
stadium speakers.
And the show went on - for
a while.
The seniors led Michigan out
of the tunnel 30 minutes later.
There was no "Go Blue" banner
and no marching band fanfare.
It was quiet. The loudest sound
was Jordan Kovacs popping
Carder just moments later for a
sack.
Football tackles setting the
cadence at the Big House, Hoke
can buy into that one.
The game was designed to
be a spectacle. The massive
new scoreboards were built to
impress. The high-definition
screens were meant to make
you question whether turning
your head back to the field was
worth it.
But, instead of showing
replays, the scoreboards spent
the better part of two hours

streaming the live weather
radar.
Meanwhile, Hoke brought
in his new version of Michigan
football. The offense was a
throwback with a bit of spread
offense flair and Robinson in
the shotgun. A 43-yard run from
Toussaint was good, but it was
wide receiver Junior Heming-
way's downfield block that Hoke
remembered.
The defense wasn't great,
but it was manageable. Mother
Nature took care of the rest.
A plus-3 day in the turn-
over margin still made Hoke
say he wasn't too pleased with
the defense. And he felt a bit
slighted when he walked into
the locker room and told 'Team
132' that their first mission was
over - victorious but in the
third quarter.
When Michigan was
announced as the winner, the
crowd of zero sat on its hands.
There wasn't even a band there
to play "The Victors." It was the
least celebrated debut victory in
the history of debut victories.
Granted, a win's a win. Michi-
gan really won, Western Michi-
gan really lost. But this one still
felt incompl-

School of Education unveils center
named in honor of Brandon family :

New center houses
digital library of
teaching resources
HALEY GLATTHORN
Daily StaffReporter
A crowd gathered around a
large flat screen television in
a newly constructed School of
Education wing to watch an ele-
mentary school teacher lead her
students through a math lesson.
While viewing footage of a
teacher's class is not uncom-
mon in the School of Education,
this scene would not have hap-
pened one month ago. Univer-
sity leaders, including School of
Education Dean Deborah Ball,
Athletic Director Dave Brandon,
Provost Philip Hanlon and Dean
of Libraries Paul Courant, gath-
ered Friday for the grand open-
ing of the Brandon Center for
the Study of Education Practice
- a digital library and commu-
nal area for students to access a
collection of teacher video foot-
age and materials, collaborate on
projects and spend time between
classes.
The facility - located on the
second floor of the School of
Education - is named in honor
of Brandon and his wife, Jan,

who donated $500,000 to the
University for a digital library in
2006. The University also funded
a "significant but lesser sum"
to build the new space, accord-
ing to the University's School of
Education spokeswoman Jenny
DeMonte.
Brandon, aSchool of Education
alum, said in an interview with
The Michigan Daily at Friday's
event that he wanted to contrib-
ute to the University in a mean-
ingful way, and Ball's enthusiasm
for the project convinced him
that the college would benefit
from the center.
"I want it to be used," Bran-
don said. "I'm going to sneak over
here every once in a while, and I
want it to be a hub of activity. I
want this to be a place that people
get joy (from) and benefit from."
The $500,000 the Brandons
donated to build the center
was part of a $4 million gift the
couple gave to the University in
2006. Two million dollars were
allocated to help construct the
new C.S. Mott Children's Hospi-
tal and Von Voigtlander Women's
Hospital, $750,000 was set aside
for the Athletic Department
and another $250,000 was ear-
marked for athletic scholarships.
The center's seven private
rooms, four alcoves and two
large common rooms all feature

flat screen televisions and other
cutting-edge technology. The
common rooms also collectively
feature a kitchen that will pro-
vide free drinks, a miniature bas-
ketball court and seating areas.
Ball called the center "central
to the mission" of the School of
Education.
"It will provide a set of
resources (such as) records of
class practice (and) records of
student work that students and
researchers can study," Ball
said. "It all happens really fast
(in teaching). If you're trying to
watch what a good teacher does,
it's gone. Being able to start and
stop (atape) is really important."
First-year Rackham student
Drew Webb said he will use the
Brandon Center for various aca-
demic needs.
"It's great for group projects,
and you can practice presenta-
tions," Webb said. "Everything is
first class (and) the newest tech-
nology. It's really conducive to
the type of (work) we're doing."
Nathan Mueting, also a first-
year Rackham student, said he
plans to come to the Brandon
Center often and thinks other
students will frequently use the
space.
"I think it will be really busy,"
Mueting said. "My only concern
is alot of people will be here."

Fraternity brothers
raise $3,200
for community
outreach programs
GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
When most people talk about
walking a mile in someone else's
shoes, they speak metaphori-
cally, but not the members of the
University's chapter of the Pi
Kappa Phi fraternity.
About 40 fraternity members
traveled 3.1 miles in wheelchairs
throughout Ann Arbor yester-
day as part of their third annual
Wheel in their Shoes 5k fund-
raiser, which began and ended at
the University Cardiovascular
Center. The fraternity has raised
a total of $3,200 to donate to the
national philanthropy arm of the
Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity called
Push America and will con-'
tinue to raise money during the
remainder of the year.
The fraternity raised more

than $1,000 last week, accord-
ing to LSA sophomore Paul Wil-
lar, the fraternity's philanthropy
chair. The money raised goes to
fund community outreach pro-
grams and local projects. Last
year, Pi Kappa Alpha donated
$580 to the Ann Arbor Center
for Independent Living at its
disability awareness dinner. In
October, the fraternity plans to
build a wheelchair ramp with
funds from Push America for a
disabled woman in Ypsilanti.
Last year, the fraternity's fun-
draising goal was $3,500, but
this year, the goal was doubled
to $7,000. Willar said he's opti-
mistic about meeting the tar-
get because the fraternity has
already raised $3,200, and the
brothers set their own goal of
$9,000 for the year.
LSA sophomore Demere
Asmar said his parents were
apprehensive about him join-
ing a fraternity last year, but he
stressed ithat Pi Kappa Phi is
"not a stereotypical fraternity."
"(Pi Kappa Phi) is not just a
group of guys willing to drink
... We want to help the commu-

nity," Asmar said.
LSA freshman Matthew Val-
lade, who observed the frater-
nity brothers wheeling through
town, said the event is "a great
way to raise awareness about a
good cause."
The event wasn't like most
fundraisers at the University,
said LSA freshman Liz Rubin,
who also observed the Wheel in
their Shoes 5k.
"It's creative, and it made a
big statement," she said. "You
could see it happening all over
campus."
LSA senior Steven Turner, Pi
Kappa Phi secretary, said the
event not only raises disability
awareness, but also allows the
participants to experience what
it's actually like to have a dis-
ability.
"You really realize how diffi-
cult it must be to have a disabil-
ity," Turner said.
Willar added that he's certain
he'll be sore in the morning after
wheeling for five kilometers.
"It is a big physical struggle to
do this 5k with just your arms,"
he said.

Mubarak trial witness:

a

No order to shoot

Protesters throw
bottles at Mubarak
during trial
CAIRO (AP) - The prosecu-
tion's first witness in the trial
of ousted Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak startled the
court in a stormy session yester-
day, testifying that police were
not ordered to fire on protest-
ers in Cairo's Tahrir Square in
a contradiction of the prosecu-
tors' central claim.
The police general's state-
ment could damage the prosecu-
tion's case that Mubarak and his
security chief gave the green
light to police to use lethal force
to crush the uprising, during
which at least 850 people were

killed.
Prosecution lawyers were vis-
ibly stunned by the testimony
of the witness, Gen. Hussein
Moussa, and angrily accused
him of changing his story from
the affadavit he initially gave
prosecutors.
Many Egyptians have been
crying out for the conviction
- and even execution - of the
83-year-old Mubarak to avenge
not only the deaths but also the
corruption, police abuse and
other oppression during his
nearly 30-year rule. If prosecu-
tors fail to win a guilty verdict
or end up with a conviction but
a light sentence, there could be a
heavy public backlash.
The 10-hour session was rau-
cous, with both supporters and
opponents of the ex-president in

protests
the audience.
Relatives of slain protest-
ers threw water bottles at the
defendants cage where the ail-
ing Mubarak lay in a hospital
gurney, as he has in previous
sessions since the trial bega4
Aug. 3. They shouted, "Mubarak,
you traitor" and "The people
want to execute the ousted one"
before court guards quieted the
situation.
At one point, a Mubarak loy-
alist held up a poster of the for-
mer leader, prompting furious
arguments between the two
sides' lawyers that devolved into
shouted insults then into out
right fist-fights.
One lawyer beat another with
his shoes until the judge called
a brief adjournment to calm
things down.

25-year-old man from Westmont,
Ill., was overdue at his destination.
A four-hour search by the depart-

discovery of the man's body floating
face down.
The site is in the West Branch of
the Whitefish River in Limestone

NASSER NASSER/AP
In this Sunday, March 30, 2008 file photo, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi attends the closing session of the annual
summit of the Arab League in Damascus, Syria.
""Secret Libyan files dsrb
final days of Gadhafi regime

Secret reports
uncover Gadhafi's
draft letter to
President Obama
TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) -
As the uprising grew against
Moammar Gadhafi, secret
reports from his vaunted intel-
ligence service flowed back to
Tripoli. Some were mundane -
how agents erased anti-regime
graffiti. Others were more dead-
ly - a spy volunteered to poison
rebel leaders' food and drink.
The reports grew more des-
perate as the Libyan rebellion
veered into civil war: Military
leaders in the western moun-
tains were disregarding orders;
troops in the city of Misrata ran
out of ammunition, turning the
situation into "every man for
himself."
These reports and hundreds
of other intelligence docu-
ments seen by The Associated
Press in Tripoli trace how the
tide shifted in the six-month
uprising that ended Gadhafi's
42-year reign. They show how
an authoritarian regime using
all its means failed to quash an
armed rebellion largely fueled
by hatred of its tools of control.
The Arab-language docu-
ments read and photographed
by an AP reporter during a visit
to Tripoli's intelligence head-
quarters contain a mixture
of military data and regime
propaganda. Amid reports on

rebels' movements, phone tap
records and dispatches from
Gadhafi's domestic agents are
memos claiming that al-Qaida
was behind the rebellion and
that 4,000 U.S. troops were
about to invade from Egypt.
The uprising began in mid-
February when security forces
used deadly fire to suppress
anti-government protests in
the eastern city of Benghazi.
The opposition responded to
the fierce crackdown by tak-
ing up arms, quickly seizing a
large swath of eastern Libya
and establishing a temporary
administration.
The conflict changed to civil
war as rebel forces grew, expel-
ling government forces from of
the western city of Misrata and
seizing much of the western
Nafusa mountain range. It was
from there that they pushed to
the coast, then stormed into the
capital on Aug. 21, effectively
ending Gadhafi's rule.
Throughout the war, Gad-
hafi's security offices in Tripoli
directed efforts to quash the
rebellion. Among those lead-,
ing the charge was intelligence-
chief Abdullah al-Senoussi,
whose well-fortified compound
received reports from around
the country.
Early on, his office struggled
to understand the situation in
Benghazi, birthplace of the reb-
els' National Transitional Coun-
cil.
One of the handwritten
intelligence reports, writ-
ten by a man who said he had

"infiltrated" the rebel council,
gave the names of five mem-
bers, their background and the
hotels they frequented. None of
the material would be unfamil-
iar to a Benghazi resident.
The note concluded with an
offer to kill the council mem-
bers.
"I can carry out any suicide
operation I'm given to assassi-
nate members of the council or
poison their food and water," it
read.
The author is not identified.
No council members have been
killed by Gadhafi's regime.
Another report parroted
stories spread by Libyan state
media that the rebels were
linked to Osama bin Laden's al-
Qaida terrorist group, that they
lacked local support, and that
they carried Viagra and con-
doms into battle so they could
rape women.
The regimetook these claims
to the international commu-
nity, especially after NATO
began bombing Libyan military
targets under a U.N. mandate to
protect civilians.
One document discovered
was a draft letter from Gadhafi
to President Barack Obama.
"It is necessary to support
Libya to get rid ofthe armed men
of al-Qaida before all of north
Africa falls into the hands of bin
Laden," it said. It is unclear if the
letter was ever sent.
The documents refer to the
rebels as "insurgents," "sabo-
teurs" "armed gangs" and
"rats."

TEHACHAPI, Calif. (AP)
- Calmer weather yesterday
was aiding firefighters battling
a wildfire that was ignited by
a deadly plane crash and has
forced residents in about 650
homes in this mountain com-
munity to flee.
Forecasters had predicted
10- to 15 mph winds - simi-
lar to conditions that fanned
the blaze after the single-
engine Cessna went down near
Tehachapi on Sunday. However,
winds were fairly calm and
favorable for crews at the fire,
which has burned more than
7 square miles or 4,700 acres,
Kern County fire depart-
ment spokesman Cary
Wright said.
"It's nothing comparable
to yesterday," he said Mon-
day. "If the weather stays
the way it is today, it would
really help our effort."
Wright said that 650
homes in three rugged
communities were ordered
to evacuate.At least one
structure was destroyed,
but that number was
expected to go up.
About 600 firefighters,
backed by a DC-10 jumbo
jet tanker and more than
a dozen other aircraft,
were battling the fire, said
Nick Schuler, a California
Department of Fire and

ForestryProtection spokesman.
About5 percent of the blaze has
been contained.
Ground crews were focused
on creating a break betweenthe
fire and the trailer, ranch and
vacation homes in communi-
ties south of Tehachapi, a city
of 8,000 south of Bakersfield,
Wright said. Firefighters were
also working to protect the
nearby wind farms threatened
by the blaze.
Authorities did not know
how many people were on the
plane that crashed, but two peo-
ple have been confirmed dead.
Their names were not immedi-
ately released.
National Transportation
Safety Board investigators
reached the site of the wreck-
age yesterday to investigate the
cause of the crash, Wright said.

To the south, a barn fire
grew to more than 400 acres
of desert brush in northern
Los Angeles County yesterday
afternoon, county fire depart-
ment inspector Matt Levesque
told KNX-AM.
Video captured by a KCAL-
TV news helicopter showed
the fireburningclose to several
homes near the Vasquez Rocks
Natural Area and Nature Cen-
ter in Agua Dulce. The park's
rock formations have served
as the backdrop for many films
and television series, including
"Star Trek," "The Lone Rang-
er" and "Blazing Saddles."
Meanwhile, a nearly 2
square-mile - or 1,100-acre
- wildfire along the main
interstate between Southern
California and Las Vegas was
fully contained Monday.

Be safe and smart
'U' should respond reasonably to near-campus attacks
As students returned to campus this past week, in the back of many
of their minds was the string of sexual assaults that occurred near
campus in July and August. With the perpetrator of these attacks
still at large and students settling into their routines, there are concerns
about personal safety and the nature of the threat. It's important for mem-
bers of the University community and greater Ann Arbor area to be cogni-
zant of these concerns and employ reasonable safety measures as the fall

semester begins.
The six attacks this summer have justifiably
piqued students' attention to issues of personal
safety; prevention has become a prominent term.
To ensure they aren't led into dangerous situations,
students should follow the appropriate actions
outlined on the Information Regarding Recent
Assaults Near Campus website put together by
University officials in response to the increase in
attacks. But students need to also help protect their
peers. Students should watch out for others in the
event of suspicious activity. Awareness and com-
munity support are essential to make sure Univer-
sity students remain safe, according to Ann Arbor
Police Chief Barnett Jones.
The creation of the website was a significant step
by the University to not only provide the commu-
nity with valuable information, but also show that
administrators are responding seriously to these
attacks. Students should take advantage of this
resource and use the tools at their disposal, like
late-night transportation options offered by the
University. It's necessary that students adhere to
the preventative measures outlined on the site by
walking in groups when possible, being aware of
their surroundings and locking their doors.
Ann Arbor police and DPS have demonstrated
that they are working hard to catch the one or mul-
tiple attackers by increasing their patrol hours.

However, the city of Ann Arbor needs to demon-
strate that they take these attacks seriously by
responding to student concerns about off-campus
lighting. Studies of how effective street lighting
is in deterring crime are inconclusive. However,
lighting improves students' sense of personal safe-
ty and their ability to monitor their surroundings.
City Council members need to respond to students'
calls for increased street lighting and make off-
campus areas more secure for students.
While the recent off-campus attacks are
extremely concerning, it's important to acknowl-
edge that these types of attacks don't represent
the norm in college campus sexual assaults.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, 80
percent to 90 percent of sexual attacks on col-
lege campuses occur among people who know
each other. The same study found that 5 percent
of completed and attempted rapes of college stu-
dents go unreported to police or other campus law
enforcement.
Returning to campus for the fall semester is an
exciting time and should be enjoyed by students.
While the recent attacks near campus have many
students concerned about their safety, taking
reasonable measures on and around campus will
help students to feel more secure at the University
while the perpetrator(s) remains at large.

Welcome!Whetheryou're afreshmanterrifiedof
stepping on the 'M' in fear of failing your first blue
book exam or a senior dreading graduation day and
takingthe first step into the real world, The Michi-
gan Daily is here to guide you through the year and
keep you up-to-date on the latest campus news.
Who we are
Our staff of about 150 student reporters, pho-
tographers and designers work together to put out
a daily newspaper that reflects the traditions and
standards upheld by generations of Daily staffers
from the past 121 years. Some days, we produce
a paper with front page stories that take hours of
reporting, research and investigating. Other days,
we're running around the second floor of the Stan-
ford Lipsey Student Publications Building scram-
bling to meet 2 a.m. deadline.
The Daily is run entirely by students. We receive
no funding from the University, which ensures we
have complete editorial control and can freely report
any University wrongdoings. The student journal-
ists at the Daily take their jobs seriously and often
work untilthe early hours of the morning to produce
stories that inform students, faculty, staff and Ann
Arbor residents aboutissues that affect their lives.
Connecting withyou
Over the past few months, the Daily has expand-
ed the way we deliver news in an effort to get you
the stories you want - when and where you want
them. In keeping up with the ever-evolving digital
landscape, we have increased our Facebook and
Twitter use.
After a Facebook competition with the school
down South last semester, the Daily became one of
the most 'liked' college newspapers in the nation.
(And thanks to you, we beat the Buckeyes.) We've
also increased the number of Twitter profiles and
have accounts for almost every section of the paper.
You can follow us: @michigandaily, @michdai-
lysports, @michdailyarts, @michdailyphoto and
@michdailyfball. In October, we will compete
against The State News to see which school news-
paper can dominate the Twittersphere - stay tuned
to learn how you can help us crush the Spartans.
What's new
This year, the Daily has appointed its second-ever
public editor (also known as an ombudsman) who
will write columns about good and bad Daily cover-
age, decisions made by Daily staff and respond to
readers who have concerns about anything they see
in the paper. We've created this position in order to
keep us accountable for our coverage and to better
address your concerns. To contact the public editor
Imran Syed, please e-mail publiceditor@michigan-
daily.com.
In the coming months, you'll notice more online
videos and new blogs, including ones devoted to
fashion and crime notes. We've added new e-news-
letters. Visit www.michigandaily.com/subscribel-
ist to sign up for breaking news, football, arts, Ann
Arbor news and more. The Daily also created a
website, www.maizeandbluereview.com, where

students can view results of teacher evaluations
and grade distributions by instructors. In another
endeavor to connect the University community, the
Daily recently launched www.themichdiff.com'

Share your thoughts
We recognize that the Daily wouldn't exist in
print or online without you. At the end of the day,
your support, opinions and ideas make this paper
one of the best in the country. (And I'm not just
being biased. In April, the Society of Professional
Journalists named the Daily among the top 10 col}
lege newspapers in the United States.)
We want to keep open communication with
readers going. If you're part of an organization
that wants to publicize an event or saw something
on campus that would make a great story, e-mail
news@michigandaily.com to let us know. We can't
promise to include everything in the paper, but
we'll do our best.

ASHLEY HARRISON I
Crime reports are too generic

4

Dear University of Michigan Department of
Public Safety:
In light of the recent sexual assaults that have
occurred in Ann Arbor, I would first like your
department to know that I appreciate your efforts
to make our community safer. I am comforted
in knowing that you have increased the number
of patrol cars and are educating our community
about what precautions we can take to avoid sub-
sequent incidents.
I would, however, like to bring to your attention
a growing and prevalent problem regarding DPS
crime alerts. According to your website, the mis-
sion statement of your department is "to contrib-
ute and to promote a safe and secure community,
while respecting the rights and dignity of all per-
sons utilizing the facilities and programs of the
University of Michigan." I feel that the vague and/
or conflicting descriptions of black male suspects
in these crime reports do not respect the rights or
dignity of the black community of this campus.
These descriptions do not prevent crime or help
us find suspects, but instead promote racial pro-
filing.
On Aug. 27, 2011, the University community
received a crime report in which the suspect of
an assault incident was described as a "black

male, possibly bald or with dread locks, wearing
an orange, black, or red t-shirt, with gray sweat
pants." Unless both the suspect and victim of this
assault were Stevie Wonder, this description is
highly unlikely.
Dave Chappelle, a black male who, unlike Ste-
vie Wonder, is indisputably bald, jokes that the
police alert people to "be on the look out for a
black male between 47" and 6'8," between 120
and 280 pounds." While this may sound ridicu-
lous, direct quotes from DPS crime reports like
"group of black males" and "five black males"
offer the same amount of information as Dave
Chappelle's humorously absurd description.
With vague descriptions such as these, what is
the University community to do? Should we stop
every group of black males we pass (carefully
counting to make sure that there are, in fact, five
of them), or are we condemned to forever "change
the world" via Facebook statuses? I urge DPS to
stop sending out these ambiguous crime reports
if only for the sake of the generic black male. Six-
foot black males are people too.
Sincerely,
Generic Angry Black Woman

Pakistani agents arrest top al-Qaida
leader said to work with bin-Laden

One of Jacques Chirac's lawyers Georges Kiejman gestures yesterday as he answers reporters at the Paris courthouse for
Chirac's trial. Former French president Jacques Chirac's corruption trial resumed yesterday.
Judge: Chirac is not required
to attend corruption trial

Capture shows
further weakening
of terrorist
organization
ISLAMABAD (AP) - A bat-
tered al-Qaida suffered another
significant blow when Pakistani
agents working with the CIA
arrested a senior leader believed
to have been tasked by Osama bin
Laden with targeting American
economic interests around the
globe, Pakistan announced yes-
terday.
Younis al-Mauritani's arrest -
made public six days before the
tO-year anniversary of the 9/11
attacks - also points to improved
cooperation between two uneasy
anti-terror allies after the rancor
surrounding bin Laden's killing.
Al-Qaida has seen its senior
ranks thinned since bin Laden
was killed May 2 in a raid by U.S.
Navy SEALs in Pakistan without
the knowledge of local authori-
ties. Atiyah Abd al-Rahman,
the terror network's No. 2, was
killed in a CIA missile strike last
month.
Pakistan's unusual public
announcement of close coop-
eration with the U.S. spy agency
appeared aimed at reversing
the widespread perception that
ties between the CIA and Paki-
stan's Inter-Services Intelligence
agency had been badly damaged
by bin Laden's death. The Paki-
stanis accused the Americans of
violating their sovereignty with

the raid, while Washington was
angry the terror leader had been
found in a house in a military
garrison town.
The Pakistani military said
the arrest of al-Mauritani and
two other Qaida operatives took
place near the Afghan border in
the southwestern city of Quetta,
long known as a base for mili-
tants. It did not say when. The
arrests were carried out in the
past two weeks, according to a
U.S. official speaking on con-
dition of anonymity to discuss
intelligence matters.
The capture of an al-Qaida
operative inside Pakistan has
become rare in recent years:
most targets of CIA operations
in the country have been killed
by drone aircraft in a relentless
series of operations that started
to increase in 2008. His capture
is likely to create chaos within
al-Qaida: even if he does not
reveal compromising informa-
tion, that possibility is almost
certain to force the network to
alter plans, move operatives and
make a variety of other sudden
changes, damaging its ability to
carry out attacks.
"This operation was planned
and conducted with technical
assistance of United State Intel-
ligence Agencies with whom
Inter-Services Intelligence has
a strong, historic intelligence
relationship. Both Pakistan and
United States Intelligence agen-
cies continue to work closely
together to enhance security of
their respective nations," the
military said in a written state-

ment.
Al-Qaida's center of operations
is believed to be in the lawless
tribal areas of northwest Paki-
stan, many hours from Quetta,
a large city that is home to both
the Taliban's ruling council and
a significant Pakistani military
presence.
The statement said al-Mauri-
tani was mainly responsible for
al-Qaida's international opera-
tions and was tasked by bin
Laden with hitting targets of eco-
nomiq importance in America,
Europe and Australia. It said he
was planning attacks on gas and
oil pipelines, power generating
dams and oil tankers that would
be hit by explosive-laden speed
boats in international waters.
It named the other two detain-
ees as Abdul-Ghaffar al-Shami
and Messara al-Shami. In its
statement, the Pakistani army
also described them as senior
operatives.
"This action has dealt yet
another blow to al-Qaida and is
an example of the longstanding
partnership between the United
States and Pakistan in fighting
terrorism," White House spokes-
man Tommy Vietor said. "We
applaud the actions of Pakistan's
intelligence and 'security ser-
vices that led to the capture of a
senior al-Qaida operative who
was involved in planning attacks
against the interests of the United
States and many other countries."
The U.S. has said it doesn't
know of any specific al-Qaida
plot to attack the U.S. ahead of
Sept. 11.

Former French
president suffering
memory lapses
PARIS (AP) - Former French
President Jacques Chirac won't
have to attend his long-awaited
corruption trial, ajudge ruled yes-
terday, after Chirac's lawyers said
the 78-year-old is suffering from
severe memory lapses.
Judge Dominique Pauthe said
he took into account a written
appeal and four-page medical
report sent Friday by Chirac's
defense team, and decided that
the trial will be allowed to go
ahead without the ex-president in
court.
"In light of the items received in
support of this letter, the personal
appearance will not be ordered,"
Pauthe said after deliberating
for less than an hour. "Jacques
Chirac will thus be judged in his
absence."
France's first trial involving a
former head of state since World
War II involves the alleged cre-

ation of more than two-dozen
fake City Hall jobs used to fund
Chirac's conservative party while
he was mayor of Paris from 1977
to 1995.
Chirac, who has repeatedly
denied any wrongdoing, enjoyed
immunity from prosecution dur-
ing his subsequent 12 years as
head of state.
The trial was suspended in
March shortly after it began to
allow consideration of an appeal
by one of his co-defendants. On
trial yesterday with Chirac were
two of his former chiefs of staff at
City Hall and seven others said to
have benefited improperly from
the graft.
Ahead of France's presiden-
tial election next year, the trial
is shaping up as a glimpse of the
unseemly underworld of kick-
backs, corruption and embezzle-
ment that has long roiled the
French political system.
Judge Pauthe yesterday read
from the defense letter, which
said Chirac wanted to be heard
because his testimony would be
"useful for our democracy" and

show that "all French people are
equal under the law."
Chirac's legal team issued a
statement Saturday arguing that
he no longer has the full capac-
ity to participate in court pro-
ceedings, and asking that he be
allowed to skip them.
The letter, Pauthe said, came
accompanied by four pages of
medical records, including a Chi-
rac brain scan in April and a medi-
cal report drawn up in July.
"It's my beliefthathe isn'tinany
condition to remember events that
date back 20 years," Chirac defense
lawyer Jean Veil told the court.
Veil said Chirac suffers from
"severe memory lapses" linked
to an "irreversible condition." He
said Chirac's condition was not a
sickness but a "symptom" possibly
linked to his 2005 stroke or "other
origins."
Jerome Karsenti, a lawyer for
the anti-corruption group Anti-
cor, urged an independent medi-
cal exam to make sure Chirac's
alleged medical trouble is not
just an "umpteenth delay" and an
attempt at "running away."

Witness: More than
12 trucks full of
 troops entered city
NIAMEY, Niger (AP) - A
large convoy of Libyan soldiers
loyal to ousted leader Moam-
mar Gadhafi crossed the desert
border into Niger and rolled
into the frontier town of Aga-
dez late yesterday, a resident
who is the owner of a local
newspaper said.
The convoy consisted of more
than a dozen pickup trucks bris-
tling with well-armed Libyan
troops, said Abdoulaye Harou-
na, the owner of the Agadez
Info newspaper, who saw them
arrive.
At the head of the convoy, he
said, was Tuareg rebel leader
Rissa ag Boula, a native of Niger
who led a failed war of inde-
pendence on behalf of ethnic
Tuareg nomads a decade ago.
He then sought refuge in Libya
and was believed to be fighting
on behalf of Gadhafi.
W It was not immediately clear

if the convoy included any mem-
bers of the Gadhafi family or
other high-level members of his
regime.
The toppled Libyan leader is
known to have used battalions
of Tuareg fighters who have
long-standing ties to Gadhafi.
His regime is believed to have
financed the Tuareg rebellion
in the north of Niger. African
nations where Tuaregs repre-
sent a significant slice of the
populationlike Niger, have been
among the last to recognize the
rebels that ousted Gadhafi.
Gadhafi remains especially
popular in towns like Agadez,
where a majority of the popu-
lation is Tuareg and where the
ex-ruler is remembered for his
largesse and for his assistance
to the Tuareg minority during
their fight for autonomy. The
Sahara Desert market town
is the largest city in northern
Niger.
Harouna says the pro-Gadhafi
soldiers accompanying Boula
were coming from the direction
of Arlit. The desert that stretch-
es north of Arlit borders both

Libya and Algeria. Some mem-
bers of Gadhafi's family, includ-
ing his wife, his daughter and
two of his sons, recently sought
refuge in Algeria.
Moammar Gadhafi, who
ruled Libya for more than 40
years, has been on the run since
losing control of his capital,
Tripoli, last month, though the
rebels say at least two of his sons
had been in the town of Bani
Walid, one of the last remain-
ing pro-Gadhafi strongholds, in
recent days. Moussa Ibrahim,
Gadhafi's spokesman and one of
his key aides, was still believed
to be in the town, rebel officials
said.
Thousands of rebel fighters
have surrounded Bani Walid,
but have held back on a final
assault in hopes of avoiding a
bloody battle for the desert town
some 90 miles (140 kilometers)
southeast of Tripoli. The rebels
say a small but heavily armed
force of pro-Gadhafi fighters
- at least some of them high-
ranking members of his ousted
regime - have taken up defen-
sive positions in the town.

Where the big shows go
Exploring the University's on-campus
* performing arts scene
By Jacob Axelrad I Daily Community Culture Editor

Badass
ballerinas

Wynton Marsalis, Enrico
Caruso, Leonard Bernstein and
Yo-Yo Ma are only a few of the
many world-class artists who
have visited Ann Arbor over the
years, courtesy of the Univer-
sity Musical Society, one of the
nation's oldest and most pres-
tigious university presenting
organizations..
Each year audiences attend
shows of the highest caliber at
top Ann Arbor venues, including
Hill Auditorium, the Mendels-
sohn Theatre, Rackham Audito-
rium and the Power Center for
the Performing Arts. Accord-
ing to UMS president Kenneth
Fischer, these performances are
intertwined with the Universi-
ty's fundamental mission: teach-
ing, research and service.
"Research in my field means
playwrights, choreographers
and composers creating new
art," Fischer said. "Every time
those new works are performed
throughout the world they bear
the university logo on them."
As opposed to Michigan State
University's Wharton Center,
which is widely considered to
be the "Broadway house" of cen-
tral Michigan, the University
of Michigan does not generally
sponsor pop artists, rock shows
or comedians. But this was not

always the case.
"There have traditionally
been four presenters at the uni-
versity: UMS, the Major Events
Office, University Productions,
and the School of Music, Theatre
& Dance," Fischer said.
Founded in 1879 when four
local church choirs came togeth-
er to perform Handel's "Mes-
siah," UMS is an autonomous yet
University-affiliated non-profit
that rents campus facilities and
considers the University to be
its "best partner." UMS prides
itself on bringing the "town and
gown" together - exemplified
by norms such as the Berlin and
Vienna Symphony Orchestras,
the two great symphonies of the
world, making their way to Ann
Arbor on a regular basis.
Additionally, an unusually
large amount of artistic freedom
coupled with the collaboration
of over 70 academic departments
make for a premiere perfor-
mance destination with a twist:
The University's stages are not
just stop-off points for a touring
show. They're an extension of
the classroom.
"We always let the artists play
what they want to play, and they
love seeing young people and
students in the crowd," Fischer
said. "Scholars and students

come together to make what's on
stage understandable."
From its partnership with the
Royal Shakespeare Company - a
series of residencies that includ-
ed classes and symposiums
geared at deepening audiences'
understanding of the plays - to
performances of contemporary
music of the Arab world, UMS
inhabits a large niche of the per-
forming arts. It is not, however,
one that caters to what Fischer
terms "bus and truck shows."
With UMS specializing in its
own brand of the performing
arts and University Productions
and the School of MT&D focus-
ing on student shows, it used to
fall to the Major Events Office

to produce large-scale commer-
cial concerts. For a long time,
this is just what it did. Accord-
ing to Fischer, the Major Events
Office brought Elton John, The
Grateful Dead and Bill Cosby to
Crisler Arena.
A combination of differing
objectives between the Universi-
ty and its East Lansing neighbor,
a lack of the necessary facilities
at the University and advance-
ments in Detroit created a situa-
tion in which the University was
unable to remain a feasible des-
tination for touring pop artists.
MSU emerged to fill thisvacuum.

'Rip Tide' floats dreamily on
By Julia Smith-Eppsteiner C Daily Arts WriterA

n a recent midnight
excursion to Wal-Mart,
my friend and I found
ourselves wandering aimlessly
down the Home Goods aisle when
we were sud-
denly blinded
by an over-
whelming
explosion of
pink ribbons,
pink sequins
and pink
glitter. The LAUREN
preschool-age CASERTA
bedding set -
that was the
source of the ocular assault had
been plastered with seam-to-seam
images of cartoon ballerinas, each
accompanied by the phrase, "I'm a
Pretty Pretty Princess!"
"Either Wal-Mart just doesn't
care, or they honestly don't know
the difference between a princess
and a ballerina," I mused out loud.
"Probably a little of both," my
friend admitted as she examined
a tulle-covered lampshade. "But
aren't they essentially the same
thing at heart? I mean, a ballerina
is just a damsel in distress that
has to walk on her toes."
Her opinion is understandable.
Not many people have seen a bal-
let in person, and I've received
more than one sarcastic excuse
when I've asked people to tag
along to a show with me ("Sorry,
I left my top hat and monocle
at home.") Popular media and
advertising outlets tend to portray
ballet performances as snobby,
shallow and lighthearted romps
whose female characters have
been cobbled together from a
mixture of sunshine, glitter and
marshmallow fluff- not exactly
feminist role-model material.
Thankfully, the idea that
female dancers are trapped in bal-
let roles that frame them as naive
and submissive dolls is way off
target. In fact, even a quick glance
at some of history's most popular
shows proves that many female
characters not only defy common-
ly held gender stereotypes, but
also blatantly challenge society
and the supernatural while deal-
ing their enemies a (metaphori-
cal) kick in the tutu.
Just look at the heroine's cour-
age in "Giselle," one of the roman-
tic era's most popular ballets. It's
a typical story of boy meets girl,
except the boy eventually sur-
prises her with his aristocratic
lineage and she has heart failure.
She is then summoned from her
grave as a ghost by vengeful Slavic
spirits called Wilis. (Ever wonder
where the phrase "gives me the
willies" comes from? Now you
know.) Despite beinga zombie-
ghost, Giselle puts her foot down
and refuses to let the Wilis's
queen dance her ex-boyfriend to
death. She ends up holding off the
hoard of angry spirits alone for an
entire night, sending him safely
on his way at sunrise.
"Coppilia" features a protago-
nist whose cleverness ends up
saving her boyfriend's immortal
soul. Swanhilde is horrified when
she discovers the local life-sized
dollmaker has kidnapped and
drugged her fiancee so that his
life force can be used to power his
most beloved creation. Knowing

that ahead-on assault would be
useless against an evil wizard-
toymaker, she breaks into his shop
and secretlytakes the doll's place.
After completing an impres-
sively improvised dance routine
to convince the sorcerer that his
spell has succeeded, she winds
up every doll in the room and sets
them loose, allowing her to drag
her woozy beau to safety during
the ensuingchaos.
And that's just the start. Kitri
of "Don Quixote" follows her
heart and refuses the arranged
marriage her father desires.
The eponymous protagonist of
"Scheherazade" uses her wisdom
and creativity to weave the 1,001
stories thatkeep a murderous
king from killing her. A refreshing
departure from Disney's version,
Ashton's "Cinderella" takes place
in one chorus dancer's fairytale
daydream about becoming a
prima ballerina, which she later
makes a reality after exploring
her identity and proving to herself
that she was capable of the part
all along.
Of course, a few exceptions
do exist. The title of "Sleeping
Beauty" is self-explanatory and
the ballet makes no secretcof the
prince's desire to save the prin-
cess based solely on her attrac-
tively snoozing face. Modern
versions have even changed the
gift given by the fairy to the infant
princess from "an ear for music"
to "wisdom" in a halfhearted
attempt to give her character
some substance. I suppose it's the
thought that counts.
Sugar and spice
and not so nice.
But for every sleeping beauty,
there's a fiery Carmen - the
toughest character to ever wear
a tutu. Based off of her operatic
counterpart, Carmen is a gypsy
who (depending on which varia-
tion is performed) smokes cigars,
escapes from police custody and
even stabs another woman in the
face with a knife. Capricious and
free-spirited, this feminist will
allow no man to tie her down. Her
scandalous promiscuity through-
out the ballet highlights the
double standards associated with
female sexuality, and it comes as
no surprise that the independent
Carmen can only be subdued by
death when she is killed by one of
her jealous lovers.
Whether through the raw
power of a firebird or the well-
timed wit of a schoolgirl, ballet
has quietly fostered a stunning
cast of competent and courageous
women. Although obscurity and
popular culture often dilute them
down into bright and bubbly air-
heads, it would nevertheless be
unwise to underestimate abal-
lerina in character. Far from mere
damsels, these heroines have
bested fate, death and everything
in between - all while standing
on the tips of their toes.
Caserta is a damsel in distress.

The nine-track listening
experience of Beirut's late sum-
mer, moderately anticipated
album is bet-
ter than the *
title The Rip
Tide suggests.
It's the ideal
album for a The Rip Tipe
train ride, or Pompeii Records
any ride, for
that matter.
Drive, allow thoughts to trail
off with the scenery or nod into
dreamland.
The simultaneously baby-faced
and sexy New Mexico native
Zachary Francis Condon has led
the six-person, rotating lineup to
worldwide alternative success for
the past six years. As The Rip Tide
keeps its leisurely distance from
the Eastern European, gypsy-
rooted sound of the band's debut
record, Gulag Orkestar, our ears
are left vaguely missing the spice
of past worldliness.
The Rip Tide is not the most
exciting album to peek its indie
crown out of the studio, as some
of the tracks can blend together
in a whirlwind of horns - but it's
still a complex and goosebump-
inducing product. Although
drawing less from his Balkan
influences and now nestling
somewhere into American pop,
Condon manages to generate a
sound that is undeniably his cre-
ation, and it's a simple beauty.
For his third LP, Condon has

complete recording rights of The
Rip Tide under Pompeii Records,
which he founded this year.
Lead single "East Harlem"
strikes at the album's reverent
cord. Aside from this expected
leader of the pack, "Goshen" and
title track "The Rip Tide" reach
a level of intimate, calming ear
candy like the best-flavored
Chamomile tea around.
"Santa Fe" lifts the album out
of its solemn persona. On this
refreshing track, with a beat
pleasantly easy to pick up on,
Beirut will set
listeners adrift,
but won't rock
the boat.
Condon's voice is deeply brewed
as he delivers, "Your days in one
/ This day undone / The kind
that breaks under / All day at
once / For me, for you / I'm just
too young." The tender lyrics of
"Santa Fe" abstractly relate to
the young man's experience in
his hometown.
In an interview with Time
Entertainment, the 25-year-old
Condon said, "As a teenager I felt
like everything I experienced
wasn't very relatable or exciting.

"Wait I thought you said ladies love the accordion?"

So I developed this sort of wan-
derlust as I tried to find my own
identity."
It seems he has always had
an aching to try on music from
other cultures, but on his junior
effort the sound is more self-
pronounced and impactful as
he breaks away from his world-
music-guy stereotype.
If there's one complaint about
The Rip Tide, it's that it's too

accessible. On tracks like "The
Peacock" and "A Candle's Fire,"
it is easy to passively accept the
instruments' sway. Risk has
been left untouched here.
Take The Rip Tide in with
welcoming arms as a staple food
to save for the storm, for when
you need that calming sanctu-
ary. But have no worries, Con-
don is still the same charming,
ukulele man-boy.

we present and the performanc-
es that take place at the Uni-
versity of Michigan," said Bob
Hoffman, public relations man-
ager at Wharton Center. "One
major reason is the difference in
each respective organization's
mission and leadership. Whar-
ton Center has made the effort
of establishing itself as a major
market for touring Broadway
throughout its history."
Mike Brand, executive direc-
tor of the Wharton Center at
MSU, has used theatrical con-
nections from a stint as vice
president of Clear Channel
Entertainment's theatrical divi-

sion and the Wharton Center's
facilities to establish a home for
touring Broadway shows.
There's also the issue of space.
Unlike the Wharton Center, the
University's facilities are not
organized under one roof and, as
Brand said, they are simply not
big enough "in terms of backstage
space and seating capacity" to put
on these kinds of productions.
And yet, the University did
attract commercial artists for
many years regardless of spatial
difficulties. What happened?
According to Fischer, the 1980s
saw a massive renovation of per-
formance venues in the Detroit
metropolitan area.
"Places like The Palace, the
renovated Fox and the Fisher
Theater had become the better

venues from the artists' stand-
point," Fischer said.
He added, "They can also put
an exclusivity contract on the
artists for within 100 miles of
Detroit."
When touring shows have
visited southeastern Michigan
in recent years, they've tended
toward Detroit, where there's
the money and the will to attain
arena shows. This also means
the Major Events Office has been
denied the opportunity to do
what it does for some time now:
put on big acts.
"Even if we wanted to do them
there would be the question of
these exclusive arrangements,"
Fischer said. "So right now,
they're not happening in Ann
Arbor."

Comic duo's sparkle
can't guard against
film's misfires
By DAVID TAO
DailyFilm Editor
There's no reason why "The
Guard" shouldn't be an excep-
tional movie. It features the
wry humor of
writer/director
and newcomer
John Michael The Guard
McDonagh
(brother of Atthe
Martin, who Michigan
directed "In SonyPictures
Bruges"), who Classics
executes a
script full of
razor-sharp wit, straight-faced
racism and tongue-in-cheek ref-
erences to Ruby Ridge and Waco.
Two exceptional actors, Bren-
dan Gleeson ("In Bruges") and
Don Cheadle ("Hotel Rwanda"),
deliver these lines with maxi-
mum effect, playing off of each
other hilariously and giving some
of the best comic performances
of their respective careers. Yet
despite its exceptional pedigree,
the film comes off more than a
little underwhelming.
The film's script follows the cop
drama blueprint that has worked
since "Lethal Weapon" - by-the-
book FBI agent Wendell Everett
(Cheadle), partners with loose
cannon Irish policeman Gerry
Boyle (Gleeson) to arrest three
international drug traffickers and
stop a drug shipment worth a half
a billion dollars from enteringIre-
land. Along the way, they slowly
bond and come to respect one
another as they sort of investigate
the crime, drifting nihilistically
toward an eventual resolution.
From a plot standpoint, there's
not much to see here. Though
the film features cops and crimi-
nals, there's not much casework

Two girls, one cop.
involved, since, as Everett says,
Boyle is "an unconventional
policeman." Instead of the unpre-
dictability of "shoot first, file
paperwork later," Boyle's a giant
idiot who displays mild corrup-
tion, wild irresponsibility and a
pervasive sense of carelessness.
He has a predilection for hookers
and a tendency to drink and do
LSD on duty. It's all a little much
for Everett, a Rhodes Scholar
from a privileged background,
functioning as both a foreigner
out of his element and Boyle's
strait-laced foil.
The give-and-take between
Gleeson and Cheadle is the mov-
ie's greatest strength, helped
along by Gleeson's deadpan,
utterly naive, devoid-of-malice
comedic timing. Though heavy
Irish accents permeate the entire
film, occasionally getting in the
way of the film's humor, questions
about whether Everett grew up
in the projects and preconceived
notions about how "only black
lads" can be drug dealers come
through loud and clear.
These statements (and much,
much more) are all shockingly
racist, yet in Gleeson's hands, they
sound entirely innocent - not
unlike a schoolboy's curious ques-

tions about a controversial topic.
At one point, Everett poignantly
observes that he can't tell wheth-
er Boyle is "really motherfucking
dumb or really motherfucking
smart." In addition to drinking on
the job, the man plays kid's arcade
games regularly and suffers from
milkshake headaches, yet makes
intriguing observations about
their case, piecing together facts
that Everett's Quantico-trained
mind doesn't see. It's impossible
to tell whether Boyle is being
snarky or genuinely airheaded.
Regardless, Gleeson's delivery
and Cheadle's straight-faced reac-
tions are a pleasure to watch.
Unfortunately, the rest of the
film proceeds at a glacial pace.
Boyle's mother is slowly dying in
a nursing home and his regular
visits are perhaps meant to make
Boyle a slightly more sympathet-
ic character, since it's always eas-
ier to like a guy - even a drunk,
racist ditz - when he loves his
mother. These moments, like the
off skits in an episode of "Sat-
urday Night Live," aren't quite
enough to ruin the film but are
enough to severely undermine
the experience, turning "The
Guard" into something much less
than the sum of its parts.

Toussaint
emerges
as Hoke's
lead back
By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Editor
What kind of running back is Fitzgerald Tous-
saint?
The question seemed simple enough. Denard
Robinson smiled, leaning back in his chair.,.
"Oh man," Robinson said, with a guffaw.
"All right, I don't want to juice his head up too
much."
Sittingto his left was Toussaint, the redshirt
sophomore who missed eight games in his first
season due to knee and shoulder injuries, the
back who took his first career handoff from
and saw nothing but green grass in front of
him only to be caught from behind by a Bowl-
ing Green defender 61-yards downfield. He's
the same back running backs coach Fred Jack-
son said had "Mike Hart ability with speed," a
year ago.
"Fitz is probably one of the best running
backs I've played with," Robinson said. "When
he gets the ball, he runs hard and he makes
guys miss and he's fast - he's a good back."
Toussaint shot all 5-foot-10, 195 pounds of
himself out of a rocket into the heart of West-
ern Michigan's defense every time he got the
ball on Saturday, shooting gaps between the
tackles, side-stepping defenders in a phone
booths.
Relentlessly, Toussaint kept answering the
bell, launching himself into the opponents'gut.
"We just chip away until we get the long
one," he said. "Credit to the offensive line, keep
doing their job, then eventually it will come."
The hiring of Brady Hoke could be the best
thing that ever happened to Toussaint.
Last year's backfield was just as crowded as it
is now, and Toussaint was fourth on the depth
chart entering his redshirt freshman season.
Jackson said he could become the inside run-
ner Hart was, but it would take time.

Robinson's debut
in new offense
cut short due to
thunderstorms,
Woolfolk OK
By MICHAEL FLOREK
Daily SportsEditor
No one knew what kind of things junior
quarterback Denard Robinson would be asked
to do in his debut in offensive coordinator Al
Borges's pro-style offense. That included the
quarterback.
"I didn't know what to expect, to be hon-
est with you," Robinson said. "We were just
out there ready to play and we've been work-
ing all the plays, so whatever
he threw at us we had to be NOTEBOOK
ready."
It turns out 144 is the new 335.
Though Saturday's game against Western
Michigan went just under three quarters after
being ended due to lightning, it was the worst
statistical game of Robinson's career. He threw

for just 98 yards and ran for 46 more, giving
him 144 all-purpose yards. A year ago he aver-
aged 335 all-purpose yards in his first season
as a starter.
Since Borges's new offense is designed to
take the load off Robinson and distribute it
among others, Robinson's previous perfor-
mances in the spread offense aren't compa-
rable. The only way to evaluate his game is to
take his word for it.
"I've still got some learning to do," Robinson
said. "I got to do better. I think I did alright."
Seeing just six offensive drives couldn't
answer the question about whether the new
scheme bottles up Robinson's speed too much.
But there were glimpses of the past. Borges

Brady Hoke said he wants to hear

another sense he uWses in evaluat-

"I think we played OK," Hoke said

"I never felt our front like we need

Hoke and defensive coordinator

After one game, the defensive line
could be described as the weak link.

Mattison started blitzing more to

ing play in the worst way, with
Western Michigan preparing
to take a 14-7 lead - linebacker
Jake Ryan would launch him-
self through the air, toppling
Western Michigan quarterback
Alex Carder. And Carder's pass
would float, aimlessly, until it
found Brandon Herron's hands.
"I was just looking up and my
legs just carried me," Herron
said.
All the minister's son saw
was the left tackle, and once he
evaded him there was nothing
but green ahead. Aubrey Pleas-
ant, a graduate assistant, always
told him, "Whenever you get an
interception, run it back to your
sideline."
Herron tiptoed that sideline,
refusing to end his magic there.
He was listed as the second-
string weakside linebacker.
Starter Cam Gordon had a back
injury he couldn't play through,
so Brady Hoke wanted to play
an experienced player, a guy
who knew Greg Mattison's
defense, a guy he could trust. So
the fifth-year senior made his
first career start
Had Mattison called a differ-
ent formation, he wouldn't have
been on the field. Herron was

lined up at his new position -
weakside linebacker - the one
he had played all fall camp.
He had a mindset entering
his final season in an otherwise
uneventful career: He was
going to pull out all of the stops,
but he was also going to have
faith.
It made sense - the minister
took him to church a lot grow-
ing up. It was all he knew, he
says now. As sons do, he fol-
lowed his father's footsteps,
picked up his tendencies.
"I didn't have any doubt
because of my faith," he said
of his role on the team. "I just
knew I had to work and work
hard.... But I knew, in my heart,
this was my last year and God
was going to work some things
out for me."
So Herron ran. And pretty
soon he ran out of gas, he said,
but he didn't slow down. His
legs carried him for a 94-yard
interception return for a touch-
down - the longest in Michigan
football history.
This wouldn't be just any
other day.
Later, in front of a throng of
media, the first words he said
were: "Well, for one I want to
thank God."
This isn't the point in Her-
ron's story where you take
the easy way out, follow his
lead, and admit by some act of
a higher power he was in the
right place at the right time. No,
Herron's once-in-a-lifetime Sat-
urday afternoon was due to one
man - Greg Mattison - and
how everything he does is for a
greater purpose.
There's a reason Herron was
where he was. And there's a
reason why Ryan's blitz worked
perfectly. Of course, Herron
had to take care of the rest.

Maybe then faith intervened.
In the third quarter, it was no
accident Jordan Kovacs broke
free around the right side of the
Broncos' offensive line and had
two clean, free, oIly-oily-oxen-
free hits on Carder.
Herron and Kovacs saw
something in the offense pre-
snap. They made an adjustment,
and Herron came off the edge,
freeing up Kovacs for the hit.
Carder fumbled, and guess
who was there to scoop it up in
stride, only to see that beautiful
green grass again.
"I don't want to thank only
Kovacs," Herron said. "I want
to thank all11 guys who are on
the field. Because we all work
as one.
"If I'm doing my job right,
somebody else is going to come
free to make that play. I just
thanked all my teammates
because we did it together."
That's the beauty of a well-
oiled Greg Mattison defense.
That could've been anyone who
made that play. If you're in the
spot you're supposed to be, and
the other team makes a mistake,
then it's all up to you. And your
faith, if that's your cup of tea.
That's what Mattison means
when he says he wants to give
his guys enough "bullets." He
wants to put them in the best
position to succeed. But it's a
pre-determined position, one
that is determined by every-
one else on the field. Herron
and Craig Roh had to distract
the tackles and the Broncos
had to double-team defensive
tackle Nathan Brink, not see-
ing Kovacs, for him to break
through. The secondary had
to cover their men just long
enough.
The right tackle had to
block either Kovacs or Herron.

MARISSA MCCLAIN/Daily
Fifth-year senior Brandon Herron has received a lot of attention since he scored two touchdowns on Saturday.

Kovacs went inside, Herron
went outside and each would
have had Carder dead-to-rights.
It just so happened it was
Herron who became the first
defensive player in Michigan
football history to have two
touchdown returns in the same
game. Awards followed. He was
named the Big Ten Defensive
Player of the Week -Michigan's
first since Brandon Graham
won it in 2008. At one point, he
was the No. 1 trending topic in
the world on Twitter.

"I've been getting a lot of
friend requests," he said. "It's
just been ecstatic. I've just been
happy that something like this
has happened. I felt like when I
was out there after the game, I
felt like this wasn't supposed to
happen to me.
"I just didn't - I never knew.
You know, like, coming into a
game - you just - I prayed:
God show me favor. Show me
the way. And to come out with
the performance I had, I was
really shocked."

His teammates told him it
was his bald head that brought
the two touchdowns - the
result of a botched haircut in an
attempt to grow a mohawk.
"It's not my bald head. It's
just God, showing me favor," he
told them.
God, and Greg Mattison too.
-Rohan wants to know who
you think will be the defensive
hero next week. You can follow

TOUSSAINT
From Page 1B
Injuries complicated matters.
LToussaint played in four games
at running back and carried the
ball just eight times all season.
Senior running back Mike
$haw and junior running back
Vincent Smith saw most of the
snaps at running back, but they
were jet Robinson's sidekicks,
meant to just divert defense's
'ttention away from Michigan's
dynamic quarterback. In 10 of
3 games last season, Shaw and
$mith, together, failed to carry
the ball more than Robinson.
Hoke's power running game
may have been invented for
i back like Toussaint. Michi-
gan offensive coordinator Al
Borges wanted to lead with one
cunning back and ride him all
game long. The good ones usu-
ally improve the more you feed
them, he said.
But Shaw wasn't just going
to fade into the background. All
fall camp, the position battle
shifted between Shaw and Tous-
saint. Then, in the last week of
damp, Toussaint started getting
pore reps with the first team.
"I kind of had a clue," he said.
Fridaynight, Hoke announced
Toussaint would be his starter.
Hoke later said the reason was
because he liked the way Tous-
saint finished fall camp.
So Toussaint started to chip.
Four yards here. Five yards
there. When Michigan reached
the goal line on its first pos-
session, it was Toussaint who
punched it in.
"I thought there were some
hard runs," Hoke said after the
game. "I thought Fitz ran the
Mall up in there pretty hard, took
tome guys on, which is what you
ant to see out of your backs."
Shaw started the second
drive, and Smith jumped in as
the third-down back, but again

On Toussaint's next carry,

run.
"Alex Carder is as good as any
guy we may play all year," Mich-
igan coach Brady Hoke said.
"He's got some great weapons
out there."
Sophomore running back
Antoin Scriven capped the drive
with a one-yard scamper on
fourth-and-1 to give the Broncos
the early lead.
Fortunately for Michigan,
the high-powered offense made
up for the defense's miscues on
the Wolverines' first drive of
the game. Junior quarterback
Denard Robinson looked just
as impressive as Carder, going
5-for-5 in the air for 33 yards,
along with four carries for 26
yards.
Robinson finished the game
9-for-13 for 98 passing yards,
and eight carries for 46 yards -
very effective but without the
stand-out numbers he displayed
last season.
Early in the game, Robinson
featured some of his signature
plays many thought would not
be seen in this year's pro-style
offense. He played out of the
shotgun for the entire first pos-
session, dancing in and out of
the Bronco defense at every
opportunity.
"There's a comfort level prob-
ably that you want (Robinson) to
feel good about, and I think we
blocked it well," Hoke said. "I
think we were in and out of (the
shotgun) enough."
Starting running back
Fitzgerald Toussaint finished
the drive with a one-yard run.
On Michigan's next posses-
sion, Robinson threw his first
incompletion of the game on
a deep ball to senior tight end
Kevin Koger, as the ball sailed
just out of reach of Koger's out-
stretched hands. This lead to a
three-and-out for the Wolver-
ines.
Then came Herron's inter-
ception - the difference in the
game, according to Western
Michigan coach Bill Cubit.
"The game changed when we
went down there and missed a
protection, and the ball squirted
up in the air and got run back,"
Cubit said. "At that point, it was
a 14-point swing."
The Broncos didn't gain a
yard on the ensuing possession,
and the Wolverines took advan-
tage again, putting together a
nine-play, 74-yard scoring drive.
Touissant once again punched it
in, this time from two yards out
to give Michigan the 21-7 lead.
"I thought (Toussaint) ran
the ball up in there pretty hard,"

early in the week, felt better but

"There was no sense for us to

VERY SPECIAL TEAMS:
After the game, a reporter asked
redshirt senior linebacker Bran-
don Herron whether he was on
special teams. Herron sheep-
ishly raised his hand. He knew
what was coming.
Western Michigan averaged
over 30 yards per kick return on
their six attempts. Part of that
had to do with the defensive
touchdowns that were scored.
A lot of defensive starters play
on special teams. The long runs
on Herron's touchdowns were
immediately followed by a kick-
off, leaving tired players to cover
the kick.
Hoke didn't sugarcoat the
performance after the game.
"Kickoff returns were awful,"
Hoke said.
The other side was a lot quiet-
er. Freshman Matt Wile punted
just two times. Redshirt sopho-
more kicker Brendan Gibbons
didn't have much work to do.
The Wolverines went for it and
converted on the only fourth
down opportunity within field-
goal range. Gibbons still found
a way to cause Michigan fans to
worry though, as he missed an
extra point.
NOTES: Fifth-year senior
linebacker Marrell Evans, soph-
omore running back Stephen
Hopkins and redshirt junior
offensive linemen Ricky Barnum
were suspended from the game.
Hoke said he expects them back
for Notre Dame.

Michigan remains winless at 0-4 Offense optimistic

Wolverines have
nearly matched
2010's loss total
By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Editor
The man the Michigan men's
soccer team needed, the man
who could solve its scoring
woes, was inside the stadium
Sunday. But Justin Meram sat in
the stands in a T-shirt and could
do nothing but watch as his for-
mer

North-
ern Illinois.
Sunday's 1-0 defeat at the
hands of the Huskies marks the
fourth straight loss to begin the
season for Michigan. In each of
the first three games, the Wol-
verines - who averaged 2.12
goals a game last year - found
the back of the net just once.
Even penalty kicks gave
Michigan trouble. Down 2-1 to
Butler on Friday with 11 seconds
left, midfielder Fabio Villas Boas
Pereira drew a penalty in the
box. But Butler's keeper blocked
his penalty kick, and Pereira
collapsed to the turf in disap-
pointment.
Attrition and inexperience
lie at the heart of the offensive
woes. Several big names, includ-
ing Meram and the nation's sec-
ond-leading scorer Soony Saad,
departed after last year's Col-
lege Cup berth. Fifty of 2010's
53 goals left with them, leaving
behind a talented but inexperi-
enced squad.
"We've only had five games
together, and there's 12 new
players, so it's quite a lot that
we need to work on together,"
freshman forward Matthew
Rickard said after the game.

Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan men's soccer
team had its chances this weekend
to do some damage against Butler
and Northern Illinois.
The Wolverines (0-4 overall)
outshot their two opponents,
40-16, and registered 11 shots on
goal in the pair of games. But early
in the season, it's quite clear that
the team's problem isn't a lack
of scoring opportunities, but an
inability to convert those chances.
Despite Michigan's myriad of
chances, the team mustered just
one goal against Butler and was
shutout by Northern Illinois. The
Wolverines lost the games 2-1 and
1-0.
"I think the way we're playing
shows that we're able to create
chances," fifth-year senior mid-
fielder Adam Shaw said. "It's just
a matter of putting the ball in the
back of the net and just finish-
ing the opportunities when they
come."
Against the Bulldogs on Friday,
none of the Wolverines' oppor-
tunities was greater than when
sophomore midfielder Fabio Vil-
las Boas Pereira had a chance to
equalize the score with less than
20 seconds remaining in the con-
test. Already with the lone Wol-
verine goal earlier in the game,
Pereira was given a penalty kick
after he was tripped in the box.
But, Pereira was unable to con-
vert on the opportunity as Butler's
goalkeeper Andy Holte made an
impressive diving save to deny
Michigan a chance at overtime.
It was no different against
the Huskies, as the Wolverines
applied pressure on the defense.
Eight different players recorded
shots, including a game high of
five from Pereira.
Freshman forward Matthew
Rickard hit the post around the
29th minute and later missed a
header from inside the box with

less than 10 minutes remaining.
Junior midfielder Latif Alashe hit
the upper-left corner of the cross-
bar on Michigan's first offensive
possession in the second half.
"We've just got to keep working
hard and training," Rickard said.
"The goal for this week is to try
and improve and hopefully (the
goals) will come."
While the Wolverines have
appeared unlucky at times,
Michigan coach Steve Burns
understands that there is more to
scoring than good fortune.
"Scoring goals is three things,"
Burns said following the loss to
Northern Illinois. "One, you've
got to get a couple of bounces fall
for you, and we didn't today. Then,
you've got to be able to unlock
teams and pack defenses with
quick combination play. That's
something that is rehearsed and
prepared but everyone has to play
predictably.
"And then you've got to have
courage to strike the ball, be it
weak side on your left foot. If
you've got those half chances or
those little 25-percent seams,
you've got to strikethrough them."
Burns recognizes that he has a
young and inexperienced squad,
and that his players will only con-
tinue to learn and grow as the sea-
son continues. He expressed that
a lot of his players, especially the
underclassmen, are still learning
how to play both with each other
and against their competition,
so he's not worried by the lack of
goals.
He did admit that there is a
little bit of frustration brewing
from Michigan's winless start
and lack of scoring -Burns's team
has scored just two goals in four
games despite having outshot
every opponent.
"We'll do our job behind the
scenes, and the players will be
doing their job behind scenes and
we hope it appears on game day,"
Burns said.

'M' starts season off
with intrasquad meet

Intense heat and

performances
By EMILY O'DONNELL
Daily Sports Writer
While most stayed indoors
to avoid the high temperatures,
the No. 13 Michigan women's
cross country team showcased
its talent at the Michigan Open
on Saturday.
The intrasquad meet, which
was held at Hudson Mills
Metropark outside of Ann
Arbor, featured a winding
5,000-meter course.
Fifth-year senior Danielle
Tauro finished first, with a final
time of 18:02.40. Trailing sec-
onds behind was junior Rebecca
Addison, at 18:11.85.
"Danielle and Rebecca real-
ly stood out today," Michigan
coach Mike McGuire said.
"Danielle did a great job leading
us."
Redshirt sophomore Megan
Weschler held her own by plac-
ing third, proving herself as a
formidable runner for the rest of
the season.

ment today fromthe same course

Like a juggler, Michigan vol-
leyball coach Mark Rosen con-
tinues to add more pieces to the
Wolverines' attack as the young
season progresses.
But this weekend in the Utah
Valley Invitational in Orem,
Utah, Rosen must have been jug-
gling torches because his offense
was on fire.
No. 24 Michigan (6-0) bran-
dished a balanced attack and
made easy work of the four-team
tournament field.
The Wolverines recorded dou-
ble-digit kills from at least three
players in each of the matches
and dropped only one set on the
weekend.
Redshirt junior right side
Claire McElheny led the charge,
posting 38 kills on the weekend
to earn MVP honors. But she
wasn't the only one taking home
hardware at the end of the week-
end. Senior libero Sloane Don-
hoff won Defensive Player of the
Tournament, putting up 46 digs
in the three matches.
Senior outside hitter Alex
Hunt and senior middle blocker
Courtney Fletcher were also
named to the all-tournament
team. Hunt put down 37 kills
on the weekend to pad her team
high of 66 on the season.
"The past two weeks, we've
been working on the setter-hit-
ter connection," McElheny said.
"Last weekend, it was more try-
ing to build trust and over the

past week we got a lot of confi-
dence in our setters. All around,
our offense really stepped it up
this weekend. It just felt good.
Everyone looked confident and
felt confident, and we're begin-
ning to trust everyone a lot bet-
ter."
Freshman setter Lexi
Dannemiller set the tone for the
weekend, putting up a double-
double on Friday evening against
Utah Valley (4-2).
Michigan proved to be the
superior Wolverines and cruised
to a victory in straight sets. In the
last frame, Michigan overcame a
"A lot of

24-22 set point to win 27-25 and
grab its first win of the weekend.
Dannemiller had at least
40 assists in each of the three
matches in Utah and took home
Big Ten Freshman of the Week
honors.
On Saturday, Michigan lost its
first set of the weekend to Santa
Clara (3-3) to even the match at
1-1.
But the Wolverines quickly
turned up the heat and sailed
through the last two sets, win-

ning by 10 and 12 points, respec-
tively. Cal Poly (3-4) was no
match for Michigan on Saturday
evening, losing in straight sets.

huge contributions," Rosen said.
"Lexi Dannemiller as a fresh-
man, coming in and taking the
reins early, she's done a great
job. This weekend, we got great
offense out of Claire McElheny.
"We were getting more work
out of our middles and our
offense became a lot more bal-
anced."
With two weekends complet-
ed, Rosen is starting to get away
from what he called the "vanilla
offense" and add more complica-
tions and different looks.
"We changed a lot of things
in our system in the last six-to-
nine months and we need to
keep developing our offensive
options," Rosen said. "We were
pretty developed the first week-
end and this weekend we started
stepping it up a bit.
"Butwestillhave alotofthings
we need to add to our offense to
be able to beat the high-level Big
Ten teams."
Next weekend will mark
Michigan's first game against a
big-conference team when the
Wolverines head to Dayton, Ohio
to take on Florida State, Pepper-
dine and Dayton.
"It's early in the year so there's
still a ton of things for us to work
on," Rosen said. "I'm pleased
with the progress but very
understanding that there's a lot
of things for us to get better at."

Michigan drops
tilt with No. 24
Pepperdine, 3-0
By CARLY BODDY
For the Daily
Expectations were high as the
Wolverines walked onto the turf
this past Sunday.
Playing No. 24 Pepperdine
would-
test what MICHIGAN 1
Michi- UC RIVERSIDE 0
gan coach_
Greg Ryan MICHIGAN 0
referred PEPPERDINE 3
to as the
most attack oriented team (he's)
seen since coming to Michigan.
After defeating Riverside 1-0
on Friday, the Wolverines took the
field against the Waves. Despite
riding a four-game winning
streak, the attack-oriented Wol-
verines came up scoreless, falling
3-0 80 Pepperdine.
Michigan recorded seven shots
on goal in Sunday's match, but
it wasn't enough to score on an
undefeated Pepperdine squad.
The Waves took the lead just
16 minutes. in, sending the ball
over the head of junior goalkeeper
Haley Kopmeyer. Despite the fol-
lowing three shots on goal by red-

shirt junior forward Clare Stachel
and a shot that bounced off the
crossbar from freshman forward
Kate Magugian, the Wolverines
were scoreless.
Nearing the end of the second
half, Michigan was still only down
by one.
But the Waves held on to finish
the game with another two goals,
defeatingthe Wolverines 3-0.
"The loss was disappointing,
but Pepperdine is the best oppo-
nent we've played so far," Ryan
said. "They were organized, and
their goalie and defense played
well.
"We were unfortunate not to
get a goal in the second half; we
really dominated the play. Megan
Tooley in particular was every-
where, she created our best chanc-
es to score off of the dribble."
On Friday, Michigan (4-2) faced
Riverside for the first time in his-
tory.
The teams looked relatively
even in the first half, with Michi-
gan punchingnine shots on goal to
match Riverside's seven.
Coming out of half time, the
scoreboard still read an unnerv-
ing 0-0.
With just over 20 minutes left
in the game, sophomore power
forward Nkem Ezurike was taken
down in the box, darning a pen-
alty kick. Stachel nailed the kick,

leading the Wolverines to a nar-

Kopmeyer recorded her second
shutout of the season.
"The team did a great job of
managing after that first goal,"
Ryan said. "We played a more con-

servative system, dropping a for-
ward back and running a five-man
midfield, making sure they didn't
score and givingus the win."
Next weekend, the Wolver-
ines will return home to Ann
Arbor to face Western Michigan

and Central Michigan.
"Western and Central are
both solid in-state rivalries,"
Ryan said. "They're talented
and well-coached. We expect
two tough games next weekend,
but we'll be ready."

COME TO OUR
SUNDAY
MEETINGS ON
420 MAYNARD
STREET

By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Writer
The situation was all too
familiar.
The Michigan women's field
hockey team's match on Sunday
against No. 1 Maryland started
off looking remarkably like the
one it played the previous day
against Temple.
Both times, the ninth-ranked
Wolverines were trailing, 2-0, in
the second half. And both times,
a goal late in the period nar-
rowed the gap and rejuvenated
the hope of a comeback.
But that's when the second
game strayed from the first, one
that the Wolverines would have
preferred.
Because unlike Saturday,
when Michigan (2-2) managed
to defeat Temple, 3-2, in an
overtime win, the Wolverines
couldn't pull off a repeat per-
formance against the Terrapins,
falling, 2-1.
Michigan's younger players
were the heroes in Philadelphia
against the Owls. Sophomore
forward Rachael Mack tallied
Michigan's first goal midway
through the second half off an
assist from freshman backfielder
Aline Fobe. That was followed
by freshman forward Emy Gutt-
man's equalizer, the first goal of
her Michigan career.
With the game thrust into
DEFENSIVE LINE
From Page 1B
didn't make a single stop.
Carder started the game by
completing 14 of his first 15
passes on his first three drives,
albeit with short, quick passes.
Hoke also pointed out Carder
usually went into three-step
drops - so there wasn't a lot of
time for the defensive line to get
pressure.
And even though Mattison
had guys running on and off the
field - regularly playing seven
or eight defensive lineman -
their freshness couldn't com-
pensate.
The Broncos also didn't face
a lot of long third-down situa-
tions, as Hoke said, so they also
didn't get a real chance to pin
their ears back and just rush.
Those may be valid excuses
or the early signs of a problem.
"One thing we've got to do
better, we have to improve our
four-man rushes," Van Bergen
said. "Coach Mattison can't call
a blitz to get after quarterbacks.
We have to be able to get after
them ourselves, help out our

overtime, Mack - once again
assisted by Fobe - capitalized
on a penalty corner, scoring the
game-winning shot less then two
minutes in extra time.
"(Winning in overtime) is not
easy," Michigan coach Marcia
Pankratz said. "We didn't really
have our 'A' game, but to be able
to win when you haven't got your
best game is a sign of character."
The prospect of going into
overtime does not daunt the
Wolverines, and they have the
track record to prove it. Michi-
gan won all its overtime games
last season, including in last
year's Big Ten Tournament semi-
final against Penn State.
"We get really excited because
we're an overtime team," fifth-
year senior captain and back-
fielder Eileen Brandes said. "(We
know) we're more fit than them,
and that if we can just hit the
ball, it's most likely going to go
into the net."
Brandes said the Wolverines'
match against the owls start-
ed off as a 'C-' game, but their
start against defending national
champion Maryland was clearly
at the 'A+' level that Pankratz
was looking for.
Michigan was initially able
to hold its own, both offensively
and defensively. But when both
teams came out from halftime
scoreless, the Terps pressured
the Wolverines, putting Mary-
(defensive backs).
"Up front we need to get off
our blocks quicker. Execute our
moves and stuff like that. It'll
come. That was the first game."
Having allowed 151 yards on
the game's first 28 plays, Mat-
tison started dialing up more
linebacker and safety blitzes
midway through the second
quarter. Two of Michigan's
three forced turnovers came
on blitzes. By the third quarter,
Mattison was getting a little
blitz-happy, as Kovacs made two
devastating sacks in the span of
four plays - the Wolverines'
only two sacks for the game.
"Obviously at times when
they're in ... four wide (receiver
sets), you can outnumber them,"
Hoke said. "The key to it is, the
guy who is unblocked having a
great path to the quarterback.
And that helped."
Hoke acknowledged Monday
that once Mattison made adjust-
ments, the pressure on Carder
improved. Blitzing seemed like
a component of the defense that
would undoubtedly be included,
but no one wants to have to rely
on it.
"When you get the blitz call,

land in the lead with two consec-
utive goals. With seven minutes
left, Guttman tipped the ball into
the back corner of the net. But
none of Michigan's other three
shots could make up the deficit.
"We came out strong and
intense," Brandes said. "We
pressed them hard and thought
we could beat them because this
is our year. We came so close but
they had a lot more passion in
that game, and a lot more resil-
ient effort."
The lone defensive save made
by Maryland in the last five
minutes sealed the game's fate.
With the ball sitting directly on
the goal line, a Maryland back-
fielder slapped it away from the
net, halting any prospects of a
Michigan revival. Despite the
loss, this weekend marked the
Wolverines' first road games of
the season, an experience that
showed the underclassmen just
how valuable they are to this
young team.
"They just need to keep on
working and going out and play-
ing as hard as they can," Brandes
said. "Just knowing that it
doesn't matter if they're going
out and playing against an All-
American, whatever they do is
going to help us.
"They're getting so much bet-
ter and we're counting on them
because that's how we're going
to grow."

THE QUICK
BREAKDOWN
MAIZE GAUGE
The Michigan Daily football writers break down the weekend's stats that don't show up in the box score.
The Denard-o-Meter measures the success of quarterback Denard Robinson, the Beef-o-Meterjudges
how well Michigan played Brady Hoke's prototypical style of play was following the game, and the
Hype-o-Meter measures the fans' performance.

DENARD-C-METER
2 If you're look-
ing stictly
at the yards
Denards gained in the
air and on the
ground, Denard Robinson had
by far his worst day. Post-
ing just 144 total yards in the
shortened game, Robinson
was a steady 9-of-13 passing
and showed glimpses of his
old self - with no turnovers.

debut was
anything but
Brady Hokes ordinary.
But Michi-
gan certainly displayed the
style of offense expected of
it. The Wolverines ran the
ball twice as many times as
they threw it (26-13), and the
the backs took charge of the
running game once again.

110,506 earned
its grade with

game perfor-
mance. After surviving soaring

WA BRANDON HERRON
4 When it was announced that redshirt
sophomore linebacker Cam Gordon wouldn't
start Saturday due to a minor back injury,
the strong-side linebacker spot was left up to
redshirt senior Brandon Herron, who made
a position swith just weeks earlier. Herron
was thrust into the spotlight and didn't just
have a career day, he set a Michigan record for
defensive touchdowns. Herron caught a tipped
pass in the early third quarter and returned it
i I94 yards for the score and followed that record
performance by picking up a loose ball and
! running it in 29 yards for his second touchdown
2 a - and his first since the eighth grade.
FEELING BLUE
MICHIGAN STADIUM'S CAPACITY
CROWD OF 110,506
Not only did the throngs of fans filling the Big
House stands not see a complete game - they
didn't even geta full three quarters in - but they
endured intense heat and a deluge in the span of
a few hours. For the first time in program history,
the crowd was forced to vacate Michigan Stadium
in the midst of a game. Plus, in the meantime the
crowd was subjected to Pop Evil's "In the Big
House" pumping through the stadium speakers
on three different occasions. And Michigan's
new style of offense is anything but exciting.
When Denard Robinson is only running the
ball six times, it's a downer day for the crowd.
NOTABLE QUOTABLE
(Somebody) said, 'Well maybe we should
terminate the game and it really never
happened.' We'd be here 'til 3 o'clock in
the morning ... to settle that outcome."
- Michigan Athletic Director Dave Brandon on the decision to end the game.

Commencement
Controversy
As Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder can tell
you, President Barack
Obama is one tough
act to follow (at least
as commencement
speaker at an
overwhelmingly
liberal campus).
Snyder's selection as
speaker had many 'U'
students in an uproar,
and had many other
students protecting the
governor's flank. Turn

Founded in 1817, the University of Michigan is one of the finest
institutions of higher education, in the world. Located in the
city of Ann Arbor since 1837, the University has developed a
world-renowned reputation as a leading research institution
under the guidance of 14 different University presidents
over its almost 200-year history. Currently led by University
President Mary Sue Coleman, the University has a large
endowment, huge amount of research funding and seems to be
expanding constantly. These pages offer a brief glance at the
monolith that we here at The Michigan Daily like to call the 'U.'

SNYDER CONTROVERSY


NICOLE MILLER AND BRIAN KOZIARA I
Remain respectful of Rick

March 16, 2011 - Who would
have thought that a governor
elected with such a mandate
to revitalize our state and keep
young people in Michigan would
become a focal point for student
anger when he was named the
University's Spring 2011 Com-
mencement speaker earlier this
week? Why would students be so
upset at the idea of such a promi-
nent and successful University
alum coming to address our grad-
uating seniors? We believe that
such anger at the simple decision
to invite the governor of Michi-
gan to commencement is uncalled
for and unbecoming of an open-
minded University where dif-
fering thoughts and viewpoints
can be expressed and exchanged
freely.
Many of those who are unhap-
py with the pick oppose Republi-
can Gov. Rick Snyder's selection
on the basis that Snyder has
proposed cutting state funding
to our own University. But this
is truly nothing new. The Uni-
versity's website explains that
higher education funding has
been cut by every administration
since the 1960s. Over the last nine
years - Democratic Gov. Jennifer
Granholm's two terms as gov-
ernor - state funding declined
by 13 percent. Snyder's proposed
cut of 15 percent is comparable
and fair given the current fiscal
realities that our state is facing.
Some hold the additional mis-
conception that the state money
the University receives susfains it
and constitutes a source of fund-
ing we couldn't survive without.
But in reality, Snyder's proposed
cut of 15 percent in current state
funding to the University is much

smaller than it sounds. Because
state support makes up only 20
percent of the University's gen-
eral fund - and the general fund
makes up just 27.8 percent of the
University's total budget - in
reality, the proposed cut is less
than 1 percent (0.834 percent to
be exact) of the University's over-
all budget. Our University has
done well and can continue to
flourish without relying on this
state funding. This cut can be
managed. And it will have to be.
Anyone who is willing to take
an honest look at our state's bud-
get will see that Michigan simply
cannot continue spending at the
current levels. The politically
expedient path taken by Snyder's
predecessor was to back' down
from tough spending cuts for fear
of losing political support. Snyder
inherited a real structural deficit
that cannot be repaired without
far-reaching structural changes.
Luckily for us, he has risen to
the challenge of proposing long-
term solutions and has the cour-
age to move forward, even with
the knowledge that his ideas will
make him no friends. People can
complain all they want, but we
have already seen that the alter-
native - taxing the same, shrink-
ing tax base and driving real jobs
away from our state - hasn't
worked.
What's more, inviting newly
elected governors - both Repub-
licans and Democrats alike - to
address graduates at commence-
ment is a longstanding Univer-
sity tradition, going all the way
back to Republican Gov. William
Milliken in the 1980s. Those
who wish to protest the decision
would be well served to place per-

sonal politics aside, as many con-
servatives on campus did last year
with President Barack Obama
as the commencement speaker.
Where was all the hype and hys-
teria then?
In spite of some students' irre-
sponsible and immature protest
over petty political differences
with Snyder, it's highly unlikely
that the University's Board of
Regents will make any decision
other than to approve Snyder as
speaker at their meeting today.
He is our governor, whether the
students at the University like it
or not, and has taken on the task
of making hard choices to protect
our state's financial and economic
future. He should be applauded
for having the guts to make such
unpopular but necessary deci-
sions. Snyder doesn't deserve to
be maligned or ridiculed on Face-
book with crudely photoshopped
red X's through his face. Such
petty and degrading behavior
from University students shows a
lack of class and a lack of respect
for an alum holding three degrees
from the University - a loyal
alumwho is seen courtside at bas-
ketball games, who is a resident
of Ann Arbor and who has sacri-
ficed opportunities in the private
sector to serve us as governor.
Whether you agree with his poli-
cies or not, Snyder has shown true
leadership and achieved success
both in politics and in the private
sector. Let's not harangue him for
that success, but instead recog-
nize it, respect it and celebrate it
this spring at commencement.
Nicole Miller and Brian Koziara,
of the College Republicans,
are both LSAsjuniors.

MARCH 13, 2011
The Rick choice
t was going to be hard to find a commencement speaker to follow the presi-
dent of the United States. Regardless of personal political views, having Presi-
dent Barack Obama address the University's graduating class last spring was
a special honor. But since University President Mary Sue Coleman couldn't bring
the leader of the nation back to the Big House, it's no surprise that she would ask
the leader of the state: newly inaugurated Republican Gov. Rick Snyder.

0

In her eight years at the University, Coleman has
often invited major political figures to speak at com-
mencement, including Obama, former Democratic
Gov. Jennifer Granholm and former President Bill
Clinton in 2007. As the chief executive of the state,
Snyder is an obvious choice to help usher the class
of 2011 into life after college. He will speak from a
unique perspective as both a businessman and a pol-
itician. But he will also speak as someone who once
sat where the class of 2011 will be sitting, since he's
an alum who received his Bachelor in General Stud-
ies, Masters of Business Administration and Juris
Doctorate from the University.
But what makes Snyder unique is that he is a
different kind of politician. Unlike most elected
officials, he went straight from his CEO position
at venture capital firm Ardesta, LLC to Lansing.
Instead of spending years on the campaign trail
delivering persuasive speeches, Snyder promptly
made the decision to run and was elected in one year.
So it wouldn't be surprising if instead of delivering
a typical political speech, Snyder spoke in a more
business-oriented tone.
It will probably be a good speech. Snyder co-
founded and ran a venture capital firm and became
the state's governor with virtually no political expe-
rience. Clearly, Snyder knows how to command all

types of environments, and will be able to utilize
those skills when he enters the Big House on April 30.
However, the irony of this commencement speak-
er decision cannot be overlooked. Snyder has fre-
quently discussed the importance of education for
the state's future. But when it came time to allocate
funding in the budget he announced on Feb. 17, that
message got lost in the translation, as his proposal
included a 15 percent cut to higher education fund-
ing. It's difficult to appreciate a commencement
speaker who wants to reduce funding for the state's
public universities by such a large amount. While
Snyder most likely won't focus on that unfortunate
reality for University students, it will undoubtedly
be on the minds of non-graduates at the ceremony.
How can Snyder motivate the class of 2011 when the
class of 2015 will enter the University with likely
raised tuition costs and potentially fewer resources
because of his budget?
Thus far, a lot of responses to the commencement
speaker announcement have been less than enthu-
siastic. Many students are upset about Snyder being
invited. There are four Facebook groups protesting
the decision. There is also a UPetition asking the
University to reconsider Snyder for commencement
speaker that had more than 2800 signatures as of
midnight last night. And it's difficult to blame them.
MARCH 16, 2011
make deductions for supporting their alma mater.
Inviting Snyder to deliver the commencement
address tacitly endorses his gutting of the Universi-
ty's budget and his threats to University donations,
all while bestowing upon him an honorary degree.
Irrespective of students' wishes, the University will
convey to our governor that we supporthis plan, one
that threatens the very fabric of our University and
discourages successful alumni from donating.
Hope isn't lost, though. Students opposed to
Snyder's budget "fix" should pressure the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents to reject Snyder's invitation
to speak at Spring Commencement. We shouldn't
honor someone whose proposal decreases access to
education while privileging incarceration. Rather,
we should send a message of concern to the gover-
nor, noting that we're discouraged by his plans that
threaten Michigan's future.

It saddens me to see University President Mary

Rick Snyder will deliver an address at Spring Com-

initiatives that jeopardize the University's future.
The cut of $100 million to the University's budget
might seem acceptable in a time of fiscal crisis, but
consider that the budget for the Michigan Depart-
ment of Corrections will now dwarf the higher edu-
cation budget - spending $0.79 on education for
every $1 spent on corrections.
Further, Snyder wishes to eliminate personal
tax deductions for those wishing to donate to pub-

Mackinac Center for Public Policy
requests Labor Studies e-mails

FOIA request
includes e-mails
between Labor
Studies employees
By BETHANY BIRON
Editor in Chief
March 30, 2011 - A request
for public records has raised
eyebrows and caused debate for
some about the role and scope
of a sunshine law in Michigan
meant to make public entities
more transparent.
The Mackinac Center for Pub-
lic Policy recently filed requests
under Michigan's Freedom of
Information Act to obtain copies
of e-mails about the union dis-
pute in Wisconsin sent between
professors, faculty and staff
at three public universities in
Michigan.
The University of Michigan,
Michigan State University and
Wayne State University have
not yet responded to the FOIA
request from the Mackinac Cen-
ter, the nonpartisan, non-profit
organization in Midland, Mich.
that studies state policies that
has created discontent because of
the nature of its request, which is
focused on labor relations.
An article from Talking
Points Memo originally pub-
licized the requests on Tues-
day. According to the article,
the requests ask for all e-mails
from employees working at the
universities' centers on labor
research. Also requested were
e-mails that contain the words
"Madison," "Wisconsin," "Scott

Walker" -Wisconsin's governor
- or "Maddow" - in reference
to MSNBC talk show host Rachel
Maddow, who has reported on
the recent controversy affecting
Wisconsin labor unions.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the FOIA request
submitted to the University of
Michigan on Monday asked for
e-mails from the University's
Labor Studies Center.
According to the Talking
Points Memo article, a second
request was submitted to the
Douglas A. Fraser Center for
Workplace Issues at Wayne State
University last Friday. A third
FOIA request was sent to Michi-
gan State University's School of
Human Resources and Labor
Relations, the article states.
The records request was filed
by Ken Braun, managing editor
of Michigan Capitol Confidential
- the daily news wire service of
the Mackinac Center.
The FOIA requests to follow
the Wisconsin state Republican
Party's request for the e-mails
of University of Wisconsin Prof.
William Cronon, who publicly
criticized the state's Republican
governor.
The request was intended to
find evidence that Cronon had
violated a Wisconsin law bar-
ring state employees from using
state-funded resources, like
their work e-mail, for partisan
political purposes, according to
a March 25 article in The Chron-
icle of Higher Education.
Through several public state-
ments, the American Associa-
tion of University Professors and
American Historical Associa-
tion opposed the effort to obtain

Cronon's e-mails.
Roland Zullo, a researcher
at the University of Michigan's
Institute for Research on Labor,
Employment, and the Economy,
said the effort in Wisconsin
appears to be an attempt to go
after a professor who spoke neg-
atively about Walker.
"It seems as if what is hap-
pening here in Michigan is bor-
rowed from what is happening
in Wisconsin," Zullo said. "It
seems to be the case, but we
don't know yet for sure."
According to Mackinac Center
spokesman Michael Jahr, Michi-
gan Capitol Confidential has used
the FOIA apolitically, with sever-
al recent stories generated from
or assisted by FOIA requests.
"The center has used Free-
dom of Information requests
extremely effectively for a num-
ber of years both for research
and analysis and investigative
reporting," Jahr said in an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily.
Based on this history, he said
he was surprised people reacted
to the requests without inquir-
ing about the reasons behind it.
Jahr said he didn't anticipate
any public reaction before a
story had been written and was
unsure why other media sources
reported solely on the request
for information.
"I've worked at a number of
media outlets over the years," he
said.
"And it does seem to be unprec-
edented - the reactions and the
response."
Jahr refused to comment on
the content or reasoning behind
the FOIA request.
"I won't be able to speak to the

specifics of it until we have the
information and hopefully a story
to go with it," he said.
Fitzgerald said he also thinks
the media coverage is strange.
"I'm as perplexed as anyone
as to why there's so much media
attention being made to a request
for information," he said. "That's
unusual. Most of these things
don't happen in the media spot-
light. We don't know what the
record search will show, if any-
thing, at this point."
Zullo said the tactic of asking
for information from faculty at
a higher education institution is
somewhat baffling to him.
"It is an interesting sort of
political phenomenon for a think
tank to ask for this sort of infor-
mation from faculty at a univer-
sity," he said.
Zullo said there isa level of dis-
comfort with information being
requested in this manner for a
faculty members.
"The real risk here is that
e-mail is given out and basically
cherry picked for statements that
will attempt to embarrass or dis-
credit a faculty member," he said.
Zullo added that the work Uni-
versity faculty members partake
in is in support of workers, work-
er's rights and collective bargain-
ing.
"It's certainly possible to take
some of the messages, pluck
things out of context and have
them used against us in some
way," he said. "And that, I guess,
would be the biggest concern."
Fitzgerald said the recent
request will undergo the same
process as the hundreds of other
requests received by the Univer-
sity each year.

University releases admission statistics

Officials note
'surprising' increase
in applicants for
class of 15
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
ManagingNews Editor
July 16, 2011 - For the fifth
consecutive year, the Univer-
sity received a record number
of applications from students
hoping to attend the University
in the fall - 39,570 applicants
compared to last year's 31,613,
according to University Provost
Philip Hanlon.
"Because the University of
Michigan went to the Common
App this year, we anticipated
some increase in application
numbers, but I was surprised by
the growth in application num-
bers that we have actually expe-
rienced," Hanlon wrote.
He added that the prestige of
the University and the value of
receiving a degree from the Uni-

versity draw students to apply.
"This surge in applications,
particularly from non-residents,
is one more sign that students
and parents across the country
recognize the value of a Univer-
sity of Michigan degree," Han-
lon wrote.
Ted Spencer, associate vice
provost and executive director
of Undergraduate Admissions,
said the University expected an
increase in applicants when they
joined the Common App since
other schools that made the
switch over the years have seen
between a 6-percent and 30-per-
cent increase.
Spencer added that while the
website makes it easy for stu-
dents to apply to many schools
at once, it's not the only reason
for the increase. In fact, Spencer
said the University has seen a
surge in applicants for 10 years
prior to when they switched to
the new application.
The University's academic
reputation makes people want to
apply, Spencer said, and over the
past several years the greatest

increase in applicants has been
among out-of-state students.
"Michigan has an outstand-
ing academic reputation. We
have outstanding faculty, we
have outstanding facilities and
we have outstanding students,"
he said.
Furthermore, the Univer-
sity's more than 300 majors and
approximately 3,000 courses
are a "big draw" to high school
seniors looking to apply to col-
lege, Spender said.
He added the increase in
financial aid - namely the $137
million increase the Universi-
ty's Board of Regents approved
this year in light of state budget
cuts to higher education - also
serves as an incentive for stu-
dents to apply to the University.
"Anything we can do to
reduce the cost of an education
is an incentive," Spencer said. "It
can't do anything but help."
Due to these incentives, the
University is expecting the
entering class to be about 5,970
students - approximately 500
students less than last year,

Spencer said.
As of June, 16,046 appli-
cants were offered admission
and 6,540 paid the enrollment
deposit, but even those who paid
the deposit may not choose to
attend the University in the fall,
according to a July 13 University
press release.
The press release also said
admissions are based on a holis-
tic review of the individualized
information received about each
applicant, including the high
schools students attend and if
those schools are not already
significantly represented at the
University.
The University received 4,265
applications from underrepre-
sented minority students.- a
14.8-percent increase from last
year - and 1,576 were offered
admission, which is a decrease
of 3.7 percent, according to the
release.
The University will announce
the final statistics as well as an
analysis of applicants by race,
gender and other specifies in
October, the release said.

'North Campus
Rant' addresses
transportation,
social events
By ADAM RUBENFIRE
DailyStaffReporter
April 6, 2011 - Location, loca-,
tion, location was the catch-
phrase for a small group of
students who came to "rant" on
North Campus last night.
About 15 students attended
"The North Campus Rant: The
Good, The Bad, and The Dude!"
- a University event where stu-
dents were encouraged to express
their likes, dislikes and ideas for
improving North Campus. The
most common desires students
expressed to see in the campus's
future are more social activi-
ties, efficient transportation and
accessibility to resources.
Student and staff volunteers
who facilitated the event at Pier-
pont Commons sat down with
the students to discuss the area
that some students refer to as a
'satellite campus." The volun-
teers were gathering data for the
North Campus Initiative, a proj-
ect started by Royster Harper,
the University's vice president
for student affairs, which intends
to find ways to make North Cam-
pus more attractive for students.
Loren Rullman, the Univer-
sity's associate vice president for
student affairs, said in an inter-
view at the event that he admires
the vast amount of academic and
artistic activities that take place
on North Campus.
"There's lots of incredible
research going on here. Students
are engaged," Rullman said. "I
think of this campus as an expres-
sive campus ... It's acampus where
things are beingmade."
However, Rullman said North
Campus has some problems,
which students have complained
about, including transportation
to and from the area and accessi-
bility to buildings. He added that
some facilities on-North Campus
need updates.
"We know that our recreation-

al sports facilities need improve-
ment," Rulman said. "We hear
that from students."
Public Policy senior Stephanie
Parrish, a facilitator at the event,
said getting to North Campus
can be a hassle.
"There's not a convenient way
to get to the things that are hap-
pening," Parrish said. "If you
have a busy schedule, and you
have an hour, it's not worth it to
ride the 20-minute bus ride."
It's important North Campus
is "rebranded," Parrish said.
"It's a culture change," Parrish
said. "... There's already that cul-
ture that North Campus is weird
and far."
Kinesiology senior Andrew
Benintende said he goes to North
Campus because it has quiet
study spaces. However, many of
the buildings he likes to frequent
aren't accessible to non-engi-
neering students.
"Open up those buildings,"
Benintende said. "You can't get
in here on the weekends."
LSA senior Cameron McK-
night said she regularly enjoys
the fine arts shows on North
Campus, but is concerned the
events aren't widely promoted.
"I've never seen an advertise-
ment for one that I remember,"
McKnight said.
She added that more parking
on North Campus would encour-
age upperclassmen to make the
trip.
Public Policy junior Chris
Sorenson said he thinksthe cam-
pus should have more activities
for students.
"I think one way to increase
the liveliness of North Campus
is to add social events," Sorenson
said.
Elizabeth Zollweg, project
manager of the North Campus
Initiative, said she thinks the
event drew only a small crowd
since it was planned recently,
leaving the group little time to
fully market the event. Despite
the low turnout, Zollweg said it
was important to hold the event
before students began to study
for finals and became too busy.

the revenue generated during
Greek Week, Metzger said.
"I would say (this year's Greek
Week) was more successful
than other years," Metzger said.
"We definitely aren't the high-
est grossing in terms of money
raised, but we've definitely done
more in the area of community
service."
Greek Week teams amassed
more than 825 hours of commu-
nity service during the course
of the semester, according to
Metzger. In a blood drive dur-
ing the week, he said 264 units of
blood were collected, with Greek
community members donating
about 80 percent of those units.

In addition to raising money
for charity, the teams also vol-
unteered their time by cooking
dinner for families at the Ronald
McDonald House, goingice skat-
ing with underprivileged youth
and organizing a canned food
drive.
"Every year we have success
raising money, but when we can
measure success in other ways,
it feels like Greek Week is more
meaningful," Metzger said.
He added that Greek Week
isn't just about winning points
or raising money, but also about
bringing the University's Greek
community together.
Kinesiology sophomore Amy
Marks, a member of Chi Omega
sorority, echoed Metzger's sen-
timents, saying she finds Greek
Week to be a great way to unite
University community members
for a good cause.
"It's just a nice way to bring
every member of the Greek
community together to give to
charities that are really in need,"
Marks said.

Feb. 3, 2010 - With sorori-
ties come stereotypes; it is the
unfortunate reality of the com-
munity. This being my third
year in the Greek Community, I
have encountered my fair share
of Greek stereotypes and have
adopted the "take the good with
thebad" mentality. Not all soror-
ity women are the gum-popping,
hair-twirling, bra-stuffing, slop-
py partiers as seen on the big
screen. But I am willing to live
with the stereotype as a vapid,
shallow and hard-partying col-
lege girl if it means participating
in what I believe to be a wonder-
ful organization.
Many people are unaware
that the first sororities were not
founded as 19th-century organi-
zations, in envy of fraternities,
but as part of a social movement
to engage women intellectually
as well as socially. At the time,
sororities allowed women to
talk openly about topics such as
philosophy and politics, which
were taboo for women to discuss
and merited a secret society.
That being noted, I would never
"Go Greek" if it was merely a
willing submission to objectifi-
cation, as some outsiders tend to
Admittedly, recruitment
tends to involve matching out-
fits and loud chants, but it is
the farthest thing from glori-
fied pageantry. Each sorority
is founded on its long-standing
values and recruitment is a time
to find friends to share these
values and traditions with. Not
having any Greek-affiliated
family members, I was clue-
less as to what to expect during
formal recruitment, but knew it
would be an easy way to meet a
lot of people. To any friendless,
out-of-state freshman, it sound-
ed appealing (for the record, my
leggings and Northface were
owned prior to joining a soror-
ity.) It wasn't until I lived in a
chapter house that I fully real-
ized the true benefits of joining
the Greek Community.
Eager to escape the watch-
ful eyes of their parents, most
high school seniors are anxious
to live on their own in college.
But then why do so many fresh-
man women commit to living
in sorority houses witha house
mom under a roof of rules and
regulations? What is so appeal-
ing about living in a house full of
young women? Well, the impec-
cable cleanliness, homemade
meals and bus boys are benefits
to name a few - but these are
not the main selling points. Hav-
ing lived in a sorority chapter
house for a year and a half here

at Michigan, I can testify that
"living in" is an unparalleled
experience that has undoubted-
ly taught me more than just how
to share a bathroom with dozens
of other girls.
As an executive board mem-
ber, I lived with 60-plus women
who were not only my friends
but also women with whom I
worked to make decisions for
the betterment of the entire
chapter. I had to learn to seam-
lessly transition from my leader-
ship role at formal chapter to my
peer role during playful nights
in the kitchen. This unique envi-
ronment allowed me to flour-
ish interpersonally as a leader
and also as a member of a larger
community. The atmosphere
of a chapter house is rich with
opportunities, often influenc-
ing members to join more clubs
or attend campus events to sup-
port their sisters. However, the
best part about "living in" is
not the leadership or extracur-
ricular opportunities but having
hallways filled with your best
friends.
Of course, living among such
a large, diverse group of women 0
requires considerable amounts
of cooperation, patience and
understanding, but this diver-
sity gives the house a culture of
its own. Arguably, the residence
halls provide the same diversity.
But unlike other forms of hous-
ing, the women who occupy a
chapter house share the values
instilled in the tradition of their
sorority. Despite the stereotype
of being a locale for partying
sorority girls and midnight pil-
low fights, chapter houses are
ideal environments to strength-
en character, with a support sys-
tem for the women who occupy
them. While I'm happy to finally
have a kitchen and my much-
desired own bedroom in an
off-campus apartment, a part of
me will always miss living in a
sorority.
Sororities aren't perfect insti-
tutions. Like any other organi-
zation, they have their flaws.
Among other things, our inher-
ent competition and self-perpet-
uated stereotypes are areas in
need of improvement. But then
again, like other organizations,
sororities allow their members
to develop leadership skills, fos-
ter campus involvement and,
most importantly, make friends
who make college the best four
years of our lives.

'U' offers students an array
of mental health resources

By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
March 29, 2011 - With a
single click on the University's
gateway website, a list of 25
mental health treatment cen-
ters, student support groups,
student organizations and web
resources appear.
Though the lint may look
complete, the University is still
trying to find the right bal-
ance of services to effectively
accommodate students' mental
health needs. Daniel Eisen-
berg, an associate professor in
the School of Public Health, is
leading a team on the Healthy
Minds Study that is working to
find that balance.
The HMS is an annual
national survey that explores
the prevalence of depression,
anxiety and eating disorders
among college students and
examines how many students
seek treatment for these condi-
tions. The survey is a collabora-
tion between researchers from
the School of Public Health, the
University's Depression Center
 and the Department of Psychi-
atry within the University of
Michigan Health System.
Eisenberg and other
researchers working on the
study concluded that even when
students have access to free
I psychotherapy and health ser-
vices, they usually do not take
advantage of these resources.
Proposed explanations for the
findings include the lack of
knowledge among students of
the services provided, skepti-
cism about the effectiveness of
treatment and cultural barri-
ers.
Eisenberg said while these
issues are not unique to college
students, the nature of a college
campus makes it an ideal place
to study political causes.
"That's exactly what got
me so interested in this area
of study," he said. "Not so
much the idea that college stu-
dents have a disproportionate
amount of mental health prob-
lems, but it's more the oppor-
tunity that seems to be there
to have a positive influence on
mental health and the fact that
there are so many channels to
reach students and have posi-

tive effects."
Eisenberg distinguished
two major strategies to reach
students struggling with these
mental health issues - indi-
vidual interventions and public
health interventions.
More is known about the
effectiveness of individual
interventions like medica-
tion and psychotherapy,both
of which have proved to he
effective treatment options for
depression and anxiety, Eisen-
berg said. He added that public
health interventions, which are
aimed at a larger student popu-
lation and focus on preventa-
tive treatment and screenings,
haven't been extensively exam-
ined within college settings.
For University students, both
options are readily accessible.
The University's Counsel-
ing and Psychological Services
office offers therapeutic sup-
port, and the Department of
Psychiatry and the Depression
Center have clinical treatment
available. Other support pro-
grams on campus exist through
the Career Center, the Dean of
Students Office, the Spectrum
Center and University Housing
Residence Hall Programs and
Services. And if none of these
help students, there are more
than 15 other resources for stu-
dents to choose from.
Students will also have one
more option starting next week
when CAPS opens its new Well-
ness Zone. Located on the third
floor of the Michigan Union, the
new facility will feature tools
for relaxation like massage
chairs, a Seasonal Affective
Disorder lamp, stress reduction
programs and yoga and medita-
tion instruction.
Todd Sevig, the director of
CAPS, said having so many
resources is inevitable at a large
University like this, but it's
important to make sure each
one plays a unique role on cam-
pus.
While some may find it ineffi-
cient and overwhelming to have
so many options available for
mental health treatment, Vicky
Hayes, an associate director of
CAPS, said she thinks having
a diverse range of options is
important.

"I think the plus side of the
decentralization is maybe get-
ting to an option that feels like
a good fit," Hayes said.
Though students may pursue
any avenue of help they feel best
suits their needs, Sevig said he
hopes CAPS, which is free for
students, is the most accessible
student-friendly mental health
organization on campun."
Unlike other on-campus
mental health sites like the
Depression Center or the
Department of Psychiatry,
CAPS is strictly devoted to
addressingthe needs of Univer-
sity students.
In order to make it easier
for students to relate to their
counselors, Sevig said CAPS
has a staff that is diverse in age,
race and gender, which he said
is especially important for stu-
dents who come from cultures
that don't traditionally deal
with mental health issues.
Hayes, who directs a coun-
selor training program for
graduate students, said there
are currently 15 students from
different parts of the country
on this year's staff. Many of
them are in their early 20s and
can better relate to students
than the other staff members,
she said.
Additionally, CAPS current-
ly has five staff members who
were born and raised in dif-
ferent countries, according to
Sevig.
"Out of these 40 or so people
doing counseling, we can offer a
wide diversity that doesn't exist
... anywhere in Ann Arbor."
Accordingto the CAPS 2009-
2010 annual report, the demo-
graphic of students who use the
office's services matches that of
the greater student population.
Last school year, 3,362 students
sought services from CAPS, and
the year before, 3,127 students
received treatment from CAPS,
according to the report.
Eisenberg said his goal is to
make sure students who seek
that support get the best help
possible for their specific needs.
"That's kind of my overall
agenda," Eisenberg said. "My
research is to try to get more
information to sort of help us
say what is the optimal mix of
interventions."

Law Quadrangle
The Law Quad is both an imposing and peaceful part of the University of Michigan
campus. When you walk through its Gothic archways, the first thing you notice are
the giant and wizened elm trees. Many students sit in the shade here during the
warmer months of the school year while studying and relaxing with their friends.
If the magnificent trees don't catch your gaze, you've probably been mesmerised
by a building that appears to be plucked straight from Hogwarts: the William W.
Cook Legal Research Building. Within this medieval looking building you will find
the most intense group of students on campus - Law students. Due to the intensity
of the law curriculum, nothing less than utter silence is accepted in this building
Though the Law Quad was initially constructed in the 1920s, this classic monument
to legal education continues to expand today, with its latest building located bey
tween Weill Hall and Hutchins Hall set to be completed in winter 2012.

Regents extend President Coleman's contract to 2014

By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
Nov. 18. 2011 - FLINT, Mich.
- The University's Board of
Regents voted unanimously yes-
terday here to approve a motion
extending University President
Mary Sue Coleman's contract
for an additional two years.
Coleman's current contract
with the University was sched-
uled to end in July 2012, but the
two-year extension approved
yesterday means Coleman will
serve through July 2014. Cole-
man joined the University in
2002 after serving as the presi-
dent of the University of Iowa.
The motion to extend Cole-
man's contract was made by
Board of Regents Chair Julia
Darlow (D-Ann Arbor), who
read a statement in support of
the action.
"Throughoutherservicetothe
University, President Coleman
has performedtoextraordinarily
high standards and has gained
extraordinarily wide recognition
for her excellence," Darlow said.
"President Coleman has kept
our focus firmly on our mission,
and we have achieved outstand-
ing accomplishments on global,
national and local levels. For the
entire University community,
she has preserved and strength-
ened our balance, our direction
and our self-confidence."
Coleman's compensation
package will remain the same
in her new contract, though the
Board of Regents will continue
to evaluate her pay each year for
possible merit increases, Darlow
said.
"(Coleman's salary) will con-
tinue to be reviewed annually
by the Board and any increases
will be set at the discretion of the
Board, taking into consideration
performance and other relevant
factors aswe did at our last Board
meetingin October," Darlow said
during the meeting.
However, the contract does

add an additional $100,000 to
Coleman's deferred compen-
sation package for the current
contract year and the remain-
ing years on her new contract.
However, because it is deferred
compensation, Coleman will
not receive the money until she
retires.
"The amendment is designed
to build a substantial contribu-
tion to her retirement over the
remainder of her term," Darlow
said of Coleman. "Certainly, she
has earned it."
As part of the contract, the
Board of Regents laid out seven
primary goals for Coleman to
address over the remaining years
of her contract.
Among them, the regents
have asked Coleman to continue
strengthening the University's
academic mission and develop-
ing financial policies that will
preserve the fiscal health of the
University.
During her tenure at the Uni-
versity, Coleman worked with
other University officials to elim-
inate $135 million in recurring
costs from the general fund bud-
get in order to reallocate money
to higher priority projects. Addi-
tionally, Coleman has called for
an additional $100 million to be
eliminated from the budget by
2012 and another $120 million
by2017.
At the same time, Coleman
led a faculty hiring initiative
aimed at increasing the number
of interdisciplinary faculty and
programs atthe University. Cole-
man allocated enough money in
the University's budget for the
current year to hire an additional
50 junior faculty members.
The regents also requested
that Coleman work to improve
campus facilities like stu-
dent housing and to grow and
strengthen the University of
Michigan Health System. In
addition, they asked that Cole-
man create a leadership plan
that includes developing strong

MEDMA DJs bring grooves to the dance floor

6

By CASSIE BALFOUR
Daily Arts Writer
Jan. 12, 2011 - The events of
the Michigan Electronic Dance
Music Association (MEDMA)
aren't for the faint of heart. The
beat gets inyour head - so rhyth-
mic that it almost seems to match
your own pulse. With a twist of a
knob, the DJ controls your every
move, as the crowd sways in sync
with the cadence. But this song is
probably something you've never
even heard before.
"We want to raise awareness
of electronic music on campus,
just to get people interested in

this different genre that's not
really publicized too much on the
radio," said MEDMA president
Sean Masters, an LSA senior.
MEDMA was founded back in
2005 when a few friends decided
to spread their love of electronic
music across campus. Today,
the club has grown to over 70
members who actively work to
expose students to a wider range
of dance music. And after pro-
curing some equipment of their
own, MEDMA DJs began spin-
ning at countless house parties
and frats, introducing hundreds
of students to subgenres of elec-
tronic music - an introduction

that is usually met with gleeful
surprise.
"Fraternity parties are fun
because you have a bunch of peo-
ple who maybe didn't come to lis-
ten to electronic music. You have
people who just came to have a
good time," Masters said. "We
had a ton of people come up to
us to say, 'Aww man, I love this.
How come I didn't know about
you guys before?"'
Granted, obscure electronic
dance music isn't without its dis-
senters.
"Of course, you always have
the people coming up to us ask-
ingfor 'Like a G6,'"Masters said,


"but they're still a blast."
MEDMA DJs put a lot of
thought into mixing music and
crafting beats that will stay with
partiers long after the lights have
gone up.
"People listen to artists like
Ke$ha and they don't really
think about who's making the
actual beats," Masters said. "In
the electronic music world, the
person that is actually making
the music is the centerpiece."
Techno, and subsequently
modern electronic music, was
locally grown in Detroit. Accord-
ing to Masters, Detroit techno
was originally meant to be very
thought-provoking. The scene
was inspired by the repetitive
beat created by the industrial
machines found in automobile
factories, and soon found its way
from the Midwest into clubs
worldwide.
Impulse, MEDMA's main
DJing event, takes place on the
second Thursday of every month
at Necto nightclub. Though
Necto is generally the place to
go when a person wants to dance
to the dulcet tones of Katy Perry,
during Impulse, MEDMA takes
over Necto's Red Room so its
DJs can showcase their talents
and range of tastes in electronic
music.
In addition to putting on
events, MEDMA cultivates
fledgling DJs and gives lessons
to due-paying members. While
some join MEDMA with DJing
experience, many learn from
veteran MEDMA DJs. And after
they practice spinning at various
house and frat parties, they too
are able to DJ at MEDMA's pre-
miere events.
"Its kind of a steep learning
curve, but once you get the hang
of it, it's not that bad," Masters
said.
The first (and the most pivot-
al) step when it comes to mixing
electronic dance music is called
"beat matching." This is what
keeps electronic dance mixes
transitioning smoothly so danc-
ers reveling in the music won't
break their rhythm.
"If you imagine two cars on
a highway side-by-side, it's like
getting those cars lined up and
going the same speed," Masters
said. "So you're trying to line
up the beats, so when you move
from one song to another, you
can't really tell that you're tran-
sitioning."
LSA senior Alex DePorre
was one member who mas-
tered DJing during her time at
MEDMA. While a sophomore,
she joined the group despite
being an electronic dance music
rookie and now DJs events on a
regular basis - including MED-
MA's monthly soirees.
"The first time I DJed Impulse,
I was so nervous," DePorre said.
"I practiced so much and

memorized everything I was
supposed to do and I was terri-
fied, but it actually went really
well."
MEDMA DJs and other pur-
veyors of electronic music dance
mixes take affront to the idea
that they're just glorified iPods,
as Masters explained, for good
reason..
"The DJ is seen as someone
who has taken the time to go out
and find this music and blend it in
a way that kind of keeps a certain
vibe or a flow going, so it's not
very common to take requests,"
Masters said.
But don't accuse MEDMA
members of music elitism, either
- they'll mix anything with a
good beat.
"If I think the song is appro-
priate and I have it, by all means
I'll throw it in," Masters said.
"We do some top-40 remixes,
even just a remix of Ke$ha. I
actually love Ke$ha personally."
And MEDMA appreciates
how important star-studded
electronic music makers like
deadmau5 and DJ Tiesto are to
drawing new members in and
making electronic music more
accessible to the masses.
"We consider artists like
deadmau5 (to be) gateway elec-
tronic music - like this is gonna
be some of the electronic music
they'll first listen too, and then
they might come to a MEDMA
show," Masters said.
The electronic dance music
genre isn't just for superstar
DJs or high profile producers,
though. Electronic music is a
democratic art form - anyone
with talent and the right soft-
ware can produce the sort of
music MEDMA thrives on and
encourages other students to lis-
ten to.
"Its up to these DJs to pick
out the best electronic music
from tons of music worldwide,
as opposed to hearing it on the
radio and top 40," Masters said.
Masters went on to explain
the DJ's role as an ambassador
and tastemaker in the electronic
dance music world, exposing
his or her listeners to electronic
music from across the globe. The
large array of electronic music
made and posted on the Internet
by amateurs and professionals
alike has created an unregulated
market of electronic music shar-
ing that acts as a veritable buffet
for hungry DJs eager to share
their findings.
DePorre agrees with this sen-
timent, adding that the variety
allows each DJ to find his or
her own niche in the electronic
music scene.
"There's so much out there
that it's really personal - most
things that you find, most people
will have never heard of," she
said. "Right now, I'm really into
minimal, which is kind of dark

and scary."
"Minimal" is one of many
subgenres in the vast electronic
music world. It has a sometimes
eerie and sparse sound that uti-
lizes a lot of repetition. But like
a surprising amount of electronic
music, it still sounds immensely
soulful, using only what is essen-
tial in order to make people
dance.
When MEDMA isn't busy on
campus advocating for electron-
ic dance music, its members are
taking limos to electronic shows
in Canada and Detroit or observ-
ing their favorite holiday - the
Detroit Electronic Music Fes-
tival. DEMF is the latest incar-
nation of an electronic music
festival that Detroit has hosted
for years. Every Memorial Day
weekend, scores of the world's
preeminent DJs and musicians
descend on Motor City, and each
year MEDMA members go to
bathe in the glow of these elec-
tronic demi-gods.
"My birthday is right next to
Christmas, but I like DEMF bet-
ter than birthday-Christmas,"
Masters said. "DuringDEMF, we
all get a few hotel rooms and it's
a blast."
Although MEDMA members
have spun at DEMF afterpar-
ties in the past, they've recently
turned their focus back to Ann
Arbor. MEDMA has big plans
on campus, including bringing
Detroit DJ Kris Wadsworth to
Necto in February and continu-
ing its monthly Necto parties,
like the "Class is Back in Session"
Impulse at 9 p.m. tonight.
But this doesn't mean
MEDMA members are bound
to the University. Through their
tireless campaign to inject Ann
Arbor and southeast Michigan
with danceable beats, they've
introduced townies and students
alike to scores of music that goes
untapped by the average citizen.
And their only objective is to
find the mix, beat and sound that
you can move to.
When Masters ventured out
of the world of low-lit basements
and jam-packed clubs and played
for Ann Arbor citizens of all ages
at the outdoor summer festival
Top of the Park, he had one of his
best DJing experiences to date.
"There was this one guy -
he kept saying, 'Hey man, play
something I can groove to,' "
Masters said. "I thought I was
playing something perfectly
grooveable, but then I played
this song at the very end. I didn't
think anyone would recognize it
... but this guy knew every single
word to it, and he was so pumped
up.'
Ultimately, that's what
MEDMA is all about - expos-
ing as many people as possible
to electronic music and find-
ing something "grooveable" for
everyone.

TEDx events
inspire students
to get creative


By LUCY PERKINS
Daily Arts Writer
April 9, 2011 - TEDxUofM
"Encouraging Crazy Ideas" was
one of the most inspiring events
I've ever been to. The confer-
ence was basically an entire day
of talks given by smart, fresh
and inventive students, profes-
sors and professional minds of
the University.
When I walked into the
Michigan Theater, the excite-
ment and passion that the coor-
dinators exuded was palpable.
It hit me like a wall. Here are
these students, just as busy as
everyone else, who have put
all their energy into organiz-
ing something that all culmi-
nated in one day. They thought
of everything: How to make the
event waste-free, what music
will be played at lunch and so
many more things it's over-
whelming just to think about.
Anyway, after I was handed
a cute TEDx lanyard and pro-
gram, I found a seat in the the-
ater. The stage was adorned
simply yet thoughtfully with
red and black decor (the TEDx
colors) soon to be filled with
"crazy ideas."
The first speaker was actu-
ally brilliant. Parag Patil, a
neurosurgeon, talked about the
innovations of brain-machine
interface, something I had
never heard of before, and hon-
estly still can't- quite compre-
hend exactly how it works. But

I understood parts of it, and his
talk really set the tone for the
rest of the day. He talked about
something so innovative and
complex that it's no wonder a
lot of people may have original-
ly thought it was a crazy idea.
But he spoke so clearly and with
such certainty, I'm pretty sure
the entire room would trust him
with their brain if needed.
I didn't stay for all 20 speak-
ers, but I saw quite a few of
them, and everyone had some-
thing different and equally
bright to say. There were
authors, scientists, musi-
cians, filmmakers, lawyers and
explorers. And each one of them
brought an idea just crazy and
dazzling enough to stimulate
the world. But even though each
talk was different, there was a
common theme. These people
are living testaments - who are
right here in Ann Arbor - who
have shown us that achieving
the impossible isn't as hard as
it seems, and that the results of
a crazy or impossible idea are
sometimes unimaginable.
Usually when I go to events
that are so jam-packed with tal-
ented people, I feel pretty insig-
nificant and dull. But that didn't
happen at TEDxUofM. Because
these people - the students
who organized it and the people
who talked - all committed to
doing this for one reason: They
knew that a crazy idea can come
from anybody.

fow Rebecca Blacks label sells fleeting fame

By ARIELLE SPECINER
Daily Arts Writer
March 24, 2011 - They say
those who can't do, teach (and
those who can't teach, teach
gym). So what about those who
don't make it on the Disney
Channel? They sign with Ark
Music Factory.
Ark Music Factory has been
the buzz around cyberspace
since 13-year-old Rebecca Black
became a trending topic on
Twitter and serenaded us via
YouTube with our favorite days-
of-the-week song, "Friday" (you
know, today is Friday, tomor-
row is Saturday and Sunday
comes afterwards - that song).
But what really constitutes this
house of fake Mouseketeers that
we keep hearing about?
Ark Music Factory is a record
label to which young teens and
pre-teens sign in order to make
ridiculous songs with equally
ridiculous music videos only so
they can become "viral stars."
At the moment, eight artists

- - -- - . -- ___ - ---- -- YiaiC) -V -. i.'Re

are exclusively signed to the
label, ranging from the Auto-
Tuned pipsqueak Madison Bray
(who sounds like she's 21 when
in reality she's 11) to the much
more mature Ishraq, whose pro-
file photos on Ark's website are
more sex than sing.
Arkcallsitselfan"indierecord
label," but the "stars" it produces
are not what most would call
indie. I mean sure, technically
they are "independent" - being
new and undiscovered - but
what this factory really pumps
out are pure Bieber-esque pop
wannabes with over-indulgent
stage mothers and a sad life
ahead of them. I'm not saying
that these kids aren't talented
- they probably are - but they
just seem like the Mickey Mouse
rejects who weren't wholesome
or perky enough to be the next
Hannah Montana.
The main difference about
this record label is that the
company doesn't pay the artists
- the artists pay the company.
Rebecca Black's mother paid

$2,000 for a package that con-
sisted of pre-written songs for
her daughter to sing. Talk about
selling out. This is an absurd
and unrighteous way to show-
case talent. Sure, there's no such
thing as a free lunch (or in this
case, a music career), but seri-
ously - who would ever think
we'd live in a society where
people pay for their stardom?
I know some celebrities are
low enough to stage their own
paparazzi shots, but to pay for
a terrible song just so they can
become a YouTube star - that's
crazy. Maybe, I'm just naive, but
is the 15 minutes of fame really
worth it?
Take for instance our new
viral friend Rebecca Black. She
claims she wants to be as popu-
lar as the beloved Justin Bieber.
To start, she does not have the
hair. Secondly, the company is
doing it backwards. Usually,
as in Bieb's case, he put him-
self out there and then signed
a record label contract. He was
an unknown who generated a

lot of views and popularity from
the videos he put up, which then
got the record exec's attentions
(yeah, I saw "Never Say Never"
- judge me, it was awesome).
What this company is doing is
signing these hopefuls with the
promise of making them stars.
You can't push popularity like
that - that's what makes people
push back. That is why Rebecca
Black has generated so much
hatred. It's not that her song
sucks - alot of songs suck - it's
that this company is trying to
force YouTube stardom.
Ark Music Factory is a revolu-
tionary type of record label. It's
not looking for the next Grammy
winner or chart-topper, it's look-
ing for the next artist who can
gain a million views on YouTube
in 24 hours. The rise of this type
of record company truly shows
that times are changing. People
don't even want to be pop stars
anymore, they want to be You-
Tube stars. Oh, and we already
knew that Sunday comes after
Saturday - thanks.

IS IT FRIDAY, FRIDAY?

Aida' unites contemporary music and
classical themes in timeless love triangle

By BRAD SANDERS
Daily Arts Writer
Nov. 16, 2010 - "Aida,"
MUSKET's first musical of the
season, a powerhouse of con-
temporary music and ancient
themes, bridges its extremes
with a universal plotline: a love
triangle.
"Aida" has origins in an opera
by the same name. The story
focuses on the struggle of Aida,
a Nubian princess and recently
captured slave, and an Egyptian
captain, Radames, to pursue
their romance while remaining
loyal to their combating coun-
tries.
"Aida" fulfilled the producers'
criteria of a show that was com-
mercial and attention-grabbing,
as well as artistically pleasing
and comedic. Casting for the
show began during the first few
weeks of classes with rehearsals
immediately following.
MUSKET is a student-run
theater group sponsored by the
University Activities Center.
"I feel like Aida was a good
compromise, because it's a big
show ... but at the same time
not many people have seen it
because it hasn't gone on tours,"
said Patrick Fromuth, a senior
in the school of Music, Theatre
& Dance and one of the show's

producers.
With music written by Elton
John and Tim Rice, "Aida" cov-
ers a broad spectrum of genres,
ranging from rock to gospel to
disco. The powerful soundtrack
will reverberate through the
Power Center via a 14-member
student orchestra.
"The music can be removed
from the musical and out of con-
text it isnstill really relevant, and
I think that's just Elton John's
genius," said Jake McClory an
MT&D senior and music direc-
tor for "Aida." "There's three
songs that (Aida and Radames)
sing twice. I thought it was real-
ly repetitive, but when you put it
with the story, it made sense that
they were going through these
changes but feeling the same."
The choreography mirrors
the music's variety of styles, but
many of the dancers had mini-
mal previous experience.
"It's a blessing and a curse
to work with a cast that doesn't
have a lot of dance training, but
it's been a beautiful challenge,"
said Edith Freyer, a junior in
LSA and MT&D and the show's
choreographer. "It came down
to looking sharp and keeping
things simple and trying to tell a
greater story."
"Aida" willstill show offbeau-
tiful choreography with a fea-

tured dancer, Sadie Yarrington
an LSA and MT&D senior.
"I'm not somebody who really
understands dance, but when
(Sadie) dances, I'm just in com-
plete awe," Fromuth added.
"Seeing Sadie and Edith work
truly makes me see the value
and the talent it takes to do all
of that."
In addition to the music and
dance spectacles of "Aida," the
set design is augmented with
video projections, which will
be operated by two alumni who
came back to the University in
order to use this eqqipment.
"It's going to be like a movie
mixed with theater, but it's more
or less highlighting what's hap-
pening in the scene," said Kath-
ryn Pamula, a Business and
MT&D junior and one of the
producers. "This is where the-
ater is going, and we have the
opportunity to take more risks
than otherwise."
"It's not one of those plays
where we black out and there's
a scene change - its constantly
flowing,kindoflikeourdreams,"
added director Richard Grasso,
an MT&D junior. "We're not
remembering everything, but
the big impact moments of the
dream."
Evoking this dreamlike nar-
rative state, the show begins

and ends with a set resembling
a modern-day, museum. With
the aid of video projectors, the
audience is transported into
the hazy storytelling space that
exists for the majority of the
musical. The artifacts and piec-
es in the museum will unravel
an ancient Egyptian set in a
surreal fashion.
"It's book-ended with this
museum scene so we can be
reminded of the modern day
audience and how this musical
is still relevant to us regardless
of the time period," Grasso said.
"It's a timeless story ... and
we can relate to that today -
whether it be through racial
segregation, orientation segre-
gation, we can still see that in
modern times."
Bringing "Aida" to a college
stage brings increased rele-
vance, as many of the themes in
the show are applicable to stu-
dents, particularly on this cam-
pus with our theme semester,
"What makes life worth living?"
"Not only is it striking and
stirringand sexy, it kind of plays
into Mary Sue Coleman's widen-
ing your worldview and cultural
diversity at Michigan, which we
take a lot of pride in," Fromuth
said. "The show is kind of a cel-
ebration of crossing those cul-
tural divides."

lor's "Le Sacre du Printemps"
(The Rehearsal). The Univer-
sity Dance Company displayed
a remarkable range of talent as
it tackled works both old and
new. "Le Sacre du Printemps"
was restaged in honor of Tay-
lor's 80th birthday and displayed
a fresh outlook on Taylor's
renowned choreography while
remaining true to the original
work. In addition to commemo-
rating a classic composition, the
company reminded the audience
of its strong voice and original-
ity in the refreshingly innovative
faculty pieces. The concert set
the tone for what turned out to
be an impressive season for the
department.

The San Francisco Symphony
- March 8, Hill Auditorium
The audience at Hill Auditorium
went wild after the last heav-
enly chord of Gustav Mahler's
massive Second Symphony rang
out. In honor of the composer's
150th birthday, the combined
San Francisco Symphony and
University Musical Society
Choral Union - both Grammy
Award-winning ensembles
- crowded the stage of Hill
Auditorium under the baton
of world-renowned Maestro
Michael Tilson Thomas. Spec-
tacle was the theme: Before the
performance, President Mary
Sue Coleman awarded Tilson
Thomas and the SFS the honor
of UMS Distinguished Artist
Award. Thomas then went on to
lead an army of choir members,
orchestra players and two female
soloists in a masterfully handled
interpretation of Mahler's epic
"Resurrection" symphony. The
conductor brought out all of the
emotional complexities of the

1. Antoine Dodson
Every once in a while, a sound
bite comes along that just exists
to be Auto-Tuned. The summer
news clip of Huntsville, Ala.
native Antoine Dodson warning
against bed intruders is a per-
fect example. Dodson's public
service announcement advis-
ing viewers to hide their kids
and wives (and husbands, too)
is almost painfully catchy. His
distinct phrases, like "climbin'
in yo' windows, snatchin' yo'
people up" are funny enough, but
add the enraged body language
and intense eye contact with the
camera and you have a recipe
for Internet stardom. The origi-
nal clip is equally funny, if only
because we've heard the addic-
tive musical version.
Essentially, there isn't anyone
who disliked this video. But if
you did, we gon' find you.
- PROMA KHOSLA
2. Single Ladies Devastation
What's not to love about this
video? It has all the right compo-
nents for a successful and funny
home video, including a catchy
pop song, little kids singing and
dancing and a cute young Asian
boy throwing a fit. As the little
kid instantly goes from jubilant
to wailing when told that he is
not a single lady and shouldn't
sing the song, it's hard not
love every second of the video.
Whether this was really just a
precious family moment caught
on tape or a common occur-
rence for the little boy is hard to
tell. But really, it doesn't matter.
Fake or real - that boy is just too
dang cute. After watching this,
it's clear that everyone should be
allowed to jam out to Beyonct -
single, female or neither.

3. This Too Shall Pass
Most viral videos are one-hit
wonders; in time, we forget the
people behind them and move
on. The exact opposite is true
of pop-rock sensation OK Go's
consistently amazing music
videos. "This Too Shall Pass"
not only upholds the brilliance
we've come to expect since "End
Love" and "Here It Goes Again"
but tops it in terms of originality
and execution. The video is one
mesmerizing shot of the band
in a warehouse, surrounded
by a continuous machine that

eventually splatters the four
musicians with brightly colored
paint. It's nothingshort of trans-
fixing, a feat of physics and cin-
ematography that you can't help
watching through to the end
every time you click on the link.
Other bands could learn from
OK Go's creativity - one thing
we sincerely hope does not pass.
- PROMA KHOSLA
4. Double Rainbow
Two rainbows, one man. And
then, that one man's uncondi-
tional joy at witnessing such a
beautiful thing of nature. The
"Double Rainbow" video was
first uploaded in January and
gained exponential popularity
in the year that followed. Some
loved it, some thought it was
stupid, some overheard it and
thought it was porn. Regard-
less, the "double rainbow guy"
- less commonly known as Paul
Vasquez - became an internet
celebrity and embraced his new-
found fame so much so that he
was interviewed everywhere
from CBS News to "Jimmy Kim-
mel Live" to sex and relation-
ships website nerve.com ("Sex

minutes, the detailed account of
Vasquez's overzealous reaction
to a double rainbow never gets
old. It's beautiful, all the way.

5. Old Spice Advertising
Campaign
It began with a simple instruc-
tion: "Look at your man, now
back to me." Well, it didn't take
long for all of America to do just
that, and when they looked back,
they liked what they saw. Old
Spice's "Man Your Man Could
Smell Like" campaign - featur-
ingthe beautiful, divine, elegant,
dragon-taming, feral, gentle,
loving, hilarious and muscular
creature that is Isaiah Mustafa
-achieved astonishing hype
from the masses, inspiring one
of the greatest advertising ploys
ever devised. Old Spice was the
first to use new media (what-
ever that is) to interact with its
fans in a genuinely meaningful
way. From the original ads to the
deluge of videos responding to
viewers, Mustafa and Old Spice
conquered the Internet in manly
fashion.

1. Cee-Lo Green, "Fuck
You"
An unlikely trend in recent
years has birthed songs like
OutKast's "Hey Ya!" and Amy
Winehouse's "Rehab." These
Grammy-winning, chart-topping
tracks have roots in Motown-
influenced rhythm and blues, but
transcend that listening audience
with sing-along choruses that
create ultimate appeal. With a
tambourine flick, Cee-Lo adds
a bit of vulgarity to this canon,

quite-apologies we never thought
we'd hear - plus that excellent
line about the emailed penis pic
- all over that same four-note
motif. Piano is all about push-
ing the right keys at the right
time, and Kanye West is so used
to pushing buttons that hitting
the same one three times is all it
takes for him to make heads turn.

is. The wife of frontman Win
Butler and occasional vocalist
delivered her most memorable
performance to date on a song
about being silenced in the face
of an unbreakable yet non-tyran-
nical repression. The protago-
nist describes her mall-ridden,
clock-in-clock-out surroundings
as a source of creative stagnation,
similar to the artistic restraints
that have been unintentionally
imposed on Chassagne over time.
How's that for art imitating real
life? Thematic and lyrical content
aside, the track is musically sig-
nificant because it marks Arcade
Fire's first foray into disco. A
thumping beat lays the ground-
work for the seven-piece group
to crescendo in its signature
anthemic style, and a darkly col-
ored breakdown makes way for a
hopeful coda, encapsulating the
grim and uplifting ping-ponging
of the album.
- DAVID RIVA
5. Vampire Weekend,
"Giving Up The Gun"
The Upper East Side band of
prepsters - Vampire Weekend
- is known for producing some
lyrically challenging, but unbe-
lievably catchy tunes. Though
listeners may get tongue-tied
trying to spit out the words, "Giv-
ing Up The Gun," from the band's
second album, Contra, includes
mesmerizing piano plinks, a call-
and-response hook and a music
video cameo by Jake Gyllenhaal
in tennis shorts - come on, isn't
that just what every great indie
single needs? Ezra Koenig's
charming vocals with a Greek
Bouzouki sound creates a light,
airy atmosphere with a hint of
sophistication. Clearly, Vampire
Weekend keeps it classy - yet
again.

4. Arcade Fire, "Sprawl
II (Mountains Beyond
Mountains)"
Despite all of its successes,
The Suburbs has one obvious,
glaring flaw. "Sprawl II" in par-
ticular brought to light just how
underused and underappreci-

Suburban discontent - it's not
exactly glossed over in contem-
porary art. So how to give a new
take on such a worn-out subject?
On The Suburbs, Arcade Fire
doesn't try to create some over-
cooked raison d'etre for the hum-
drumchildhoodwastedjustshort
of urbanity. Each track provides
a window into the ubiquitous
2.5-kids-and-a-golden-retriever
suburban home, but with mini-
mal judgment and irony.
Frontman Win Butler is
always either one of "the kids,"
or a guy looking at a faded pho-
tograph vaguely remembering
when he was. It's because Arcade
Fire doesn't hold up any pretense
of "getting" suburbia any better
than its fans do that The Suburbs
has sprawled its way to the top.
Who hasn't seen ghostly malls
tower above infinite stretches
of flat pavement like "Moun-
tains Beyond Mountains?" And
what college kid can't relate to
old friends rebelling and drift-
ing as time passes in "Suburban
War?" Itching guitars and rising
multi-voice choruses frame But-
ler and co.'s confused nostalgia
for a childhood ill-spent - one
that much of America shares,
but that's rarely laid out so flat.
It's not a new concept. But, like
the suburbs themselves, we keep
wanting to go back.
- SHARON JACOBS
3. Beach House, Teen
Dream
When it comes to towering
heartachey melodies, Beach
House had everyone else beat
this year. Vocalist Victoria
Legrand's spectral balancing
act between Herculean mother
and smoky seductress honestly
makes 99 percent of indie rock
starlets sound like acid-washed
teeny hoppers. And Alex Scs-
ly's clean-picked, merry-go-
round guitar parts take the
word "catchy," slow it down
to half its tempo and project
it onto the folds of your heart
tissue (along with mountains
of nostalgia-oozing reverb).
Beach House may have settled
into its sound, but the net effect
feels more like a remedial bowl
of time-tested chicken noodle
soup than a lazy attempt to
cash in on a comfortable for-
mula. On Teen Dream, the
arrangements are lusher and
swoopier, feeling less conjured
by humans than anything off
Devotion. And having leaked
over a year ago, the album has
already heftily transcended
flash-in-the-pan status - this
is a record we're going to be lis-
tening to for years to come.
- JOSH BAYER

connoisseurs of tasteful expres-
sion. Aided by Matt Berninger's
arresting baritone, The National
has produced some of the most
finely layered instrumentation
of the last few years. From the
apprehensive guitars on "Afraid
of Everyone" to the closest thing
The National has ever come to
a pop song with "Lemonworld"
to the rousing reprise of pen-
ultimate track "England," The
National has outcrafted itself
(a feat many feared would be
impossible after 2007's superb
Boxer). Once again, The National
has proved not only its impecca-
ble skill in the studio, but also for
writing 11 songs that crawl into
your brain and stay there.'
- EMMA GASE
5. The Black Keys,
Brothers
The bluesy duo has done it
again. The Black Keys' sixth
studio album, Brothers, has
breached the charts and our Best
of 2010 list. This album is a com-
pilation of American blues rock
at its finest. With a soul sound
and rich guitar riffs, The Black
Keys create a sound unique to
the times. Vocalist Dan Auer-
bach brings the sultry and soul-
ful vocals with a rusty, raspy
tone that goes well with the rest
of the album. Tracks like "Tight-
en Up" and "Everlasting Light"
showcase the exacting unique-
ness and bluesy-ness with tam-
bourine-sprinkled backgrounds
and a captivating drumbeat.
Each track has an exceptional
sound that makes it stand out
from the others, but still con-
nects the album as a whole.
The Black Keys take 'listeners
on a modern Motown ride with
Brothers - and frankly, we don't
exactly want to get off.
- ARIELLE SPECINER
6. Titus Andronicus, The
Monitor
Like Conor Oberst fronting
the E Street Band, Patrick Stick-
les' lovelorn tales of drunken
revelry and wasted youth were
as epic as they were affecting.
Shot through with a loose sto-
ryline surrounding the Civil
War, each of The Monitor's ten
tracks - many containing mul-
tiple movements of their own
- sounds on the verge of total
collapse. When a track does col-
lapse, aswell placed spoken-word
excerpt from Abraham Lincoln
or Walt Whitman (voiced by The
Hold Steady's Craig Finn) was
there to pick up the pieces. As
dramatic as the band is on tape,
festivalgoers were treated to a
new mess altogether - live Titus
provided a noisier alternative to
the chillwavers and solidified
a war-torn rallying cry: Titus
Andronicus Forever!
- MIKE KUNTZ

still sound fresh. Taking the
best aspects of OutKast's influ-
ences and crystallizing them to a
funky, charming and nasty set of
jams, Big Boi's solo debut proves
that Chico Dusty's son can do
just fine all on his lonesome.
- JOE DIMUZIO
8. LCD Soundsystem, This
is Happening
LCD Soundsystem helped
define 2010's sound with the
atmospheric, deliciously synthy
This is Happening. Aging hip-
ster frontman James Murphy
crafted an expansive, often pain-
fully self-conscious album that
sounds simultaneously vintage
and modern. The albumhas afre-
netic pace and features Murphy's
neurotic, often melancholy lyr-
ics over dancy electro. The ram-
bly opener "Dance Yrself Clean"
starts out slow, but as Murphy
wistfully looks back on old
friendships, the synth explodes
into a full-blown dance track that
sets the pace for the rest of the
record. Nostalgic and dynamic,
the album is a finely tuned piece
of art with plenty of soul.
- CASSIE BALFOUR
9. Gorillaz, Plastic Beach
Plastic Beach is superficially
a critique of the artificial. How-
ever, as it progresses, it smoothly
transcends into a celebration of
synthesis through the creation of
its own genre. It begins with an
orchestral intro, and never fails
to surprise as it rises into bouts
of rap and then ebbs into bal-
lads. Where else can Snoop Dogg
be found tracks away from Lou
Reed? How else would Mos Def
share a song with R&B singer
Bobby Womack? Plastic Beach
effectually describes itself by
deftly blending various styles of
music together into a single har-
monic polymer.
- ELLIOT ALPERN
10. The Roots, HowI Got
Over
The Roots made one of the
most surprising albums of the
year. How I Got Over features
characteristically clever lyr-
ics grappling with heavy issues
like politics and religion but also
dabbles in funk on tracks like
"Right On" and reinvents indie
rock group Monsters of Folk's
song "Dear God 2.0" with shock-
ing success. The title track is one
of the highlights and may very
well contain this album's thesis
statement. Black Thought raps
over a tight beat, "First thing
they teach us / Not to give a fuck
/ That type of thinking can't get
you nowhere / Someone has to
care." The Roots engage the lis-
tener and resonate long after the
beats have faded.

2. "The Social Network"
There's a mesmerizing quality,
on current University students
and recently graduated alums, to
watching a movie about the gen-
esis of Facebook. Our generation
is as inexorably tied to its success
as is Mark Zuckerberg - if he was
the nurturing parent, we were the
Hollywood agent that realized its
potential and made it a society-
changing phenomenon.
The release of "The Social Net-
work" in the midst of Facebook's
golden years made for delicious
irony, as thousands updated their
statuses to profess their love for
the film - an expected reaction,
since the "The Social Network"
was such a supreme amalgama-
tion of expert writing, direct-
ing and acting that not declaring
adoration for the film to the world
could result in a minor stroke.
Aaron Sorkin's diabolically
good script was consistently
laugh-out-loud funny, nullifying
theinherent drabness of lawsuits,
venture capitalism and (shudder)
computer programming. Direc-
tor David Fincher created each
frame with a mama grizzly's care
and deserves an Oscar simply
for pulling a tremendous perfor-

5. "Black Swan"
Acclaimed director Darren
Aronofsky's tale of Nina (Natalie
Portman), a young ballerina given
the lead in Tchaikovsky's "Swan
Lake," turns the delicate art of
ballet into something riveting.
The best aspect of Aronofsky's
work is its enthralling predictabil-
ity. Strange as thatmay sound, the
imminent demise he constructs
for his protagonist demands a
nontraditional interpretation
that draws our eyes to the light-
ing, staging and cinematography
rather than the plot. It's another
tragic time bomb in the vein of
"The Wrestler" and "Requiem
for a Dream," and we're helpless
to do anything but count the sec-
onds until the glorious explosion.
No longer will the impression-
able masses indulge in heroin,
professional wrestling or suicidal
ballet routines. However, they
may very well continue to indulge
in Aronofsky. His vision - paired
with Portman's flawless execu-
tion - will transform his career,
and may winthe pair a few Oscars
to boot. - TIMOTHYRABB
6. "The Ghost Writer"

- DAVID TAO
7. "Winter's Bone"
The best suspense film of the
year is a family movie at its core,
though its chilly, remorseless tale
of children suffering for their
parents' actions isn't likely to
make your heart feel all warm
and fuzzy. "Winter's Bone" sends
its protagonist, Ree Dolly (Jen-
nifer Lawrence, in an unflinching
performance), outcon the hunt
for her meth-cooking, authority-
ditching father in the heart of the
Ozarks, confronting her vicious
extended family along the way.
There's an uncomfortable truth
buried here: The illusion of kin-
ship, the love we all count on to
get through life, protects no one
in a lawless world.
- ANDREW LAPIN

9. "The King's Speech"
"The King's Speech" is a power-
ful, funny and historically accu-
rate masterpiece. Colin Firth
and Geoffrey Rush play King
George VI and his quirky speech
coach, respectively, who at first,
couldn't be less compatible. Firth
wants a quick, impersonal fix to
his impediment, but Rush knows
his issues have less to do with
his tongue than they do with the
King's mind and heart. It's rare
that a film so artfully enhances
a true story into something this
moving, but the performances
and writing in "The King's
Speech" make it an instant clas-
sic.

10. "Harry Potter and the
Deathly Hallows, Part I"

By DAILY STAFF Jan. 5, 2011
1. "Community," Season 2
With classes on space flight,
dorms with elaborate blanket
forts and stop-motion class-
mates, Greendale Community
College is, without a doubt, the
coolest place to get your degree.
On the surface, "Community"
details the misadventures of
a diverse study group at com-
munity college. In actuality,
the show is a love letter to our
favorite movies and TV shows,
with episodes recreating "Mean
Girls," "The Secret Garden"
and zombie flicks. Augmenting
the pop culture references is a
meta self-referential humor that
hasn't been seen since "Arrested
Development."
As is often typical with televi-
sion, the show's ratings haven't
reflected its awesomeness.
"Community" fights against
CBS's powerhouse "The Big
Bang Theory" in Thursday's
8 p.m. timeslot. Despite being
snubbed at the Emmys, fac-
ing regular threats of cancella-
tion and struggling through its
financial woes (KFC even spon-
sored an episode, during which
Senor Chang exclaims, "I'm
trying to buy us some time with
these Doublicious sandwiches"),
"Community" has still garnered
a cult following of media junkies
and pop culture-obsessed col-
lege kids. Just like its characters,
"Community" is quirky and lov-
able. And it's the Daily's pick for
the best TV show of 2010.
- CAROLYN KLARECKI
2. "Boardwalk Empire,"
Season 1
Once upon a time, there was a
show on HBO that combined
gangland violence with symbol-
ism, intelligent stylization and
incredibly powerful acting. That
little fairy tale was "The Sopra-
nos," which came to the most
ambiguous ending in television
history in 2007.
This year, "Sopranos" veteran
Terence Winter and director
Martin Scorsese united to bring
this winning formulabackto TV.
They shifted "The Sopranos" to
the Prohibition era, moved it to
Atlantic City and voila, we have
"Boardwalk Empire" - a bloody,
symbolic peried-correct crime
drama. It's "The Sopranos"
with a loud pinstripe suit and a
tommy gun.
Really though, it's a bit "The
Sopranos," but almost as much
"The West Wing," as central
character Nucky Thompson,
the treasurer of Atlantic City,
toes the line between running
the local political machine and
supplying the underground
speakeasies with booze. His
interactions with some of the
period's most notorious crimi-
nals make for an incredible
viewing experience and contrib-
ute to some of the most complex
stories currently being told on
television.
- DAVID TAO
3. "HowI Met Your
Mother," Season 6
Ted gets the opportunity of his
career when asked to design the
new headquarters for Goliath
National Bank, Barney comes a
bit closer to discovering the real
identity of his father and Mar-
shall and Lily make their first
attempts to start a family. The
gang gains a member in the form

of Zoey (Jennifer Morrison,
"House") and a new Robin Spar-
kles video is revealed. Sound
like alot? Throw in the fact that
each episode moves effortlessly
from dramatic to slapstick, and
it's understandable why these
carefully crafted storylines have
landed season six of "HowI Met
Your Mother" onthe Daily'saBest
of 2010 list.
The series progressed this
past year, but while maintaining
the light, playful humor we've
come to know and love. Where
this beloved series will head
remains a mystery, but one thing
is certain: Co-creators Carter
Bays and Craig Thomas have
succeeded in making a tradition-
al sitcom fresh and original - a
plot-driven show that strives to
serve the story.
-JACOB AXELRAD
4. "Mad Men," Season 4
For better and worse, Don Drap-
er has gone wild - better for the
faithful and verdant "Mad Men"
audience; likely worse for its
dapper hero. Season four of the
hit AMC drama took our favorite
angry gents in a new direction,
as a new look and new charac-
ters gave the series a fresh, if
sometimes jarring, start. But of
course the alcohol and fornica-
tion are along for the ride.
With its new beginnings,
everything in the series was
taken up a notch - the emo-
tional highs have soared higher,
and the lows have become more
depressing and pitiable. In the
undeniable triumph that was
"The Suitcase," Don Draper's
late-night meltdown gave audi-
ences a raw look at the troubled
boy we always knew was hid-
ing behind the aloof faade. But
what made "Mad Men" truly
great in 2010 is just what made
it great in its three past years.
The writing is masterful, slowly
luring in viewers instead of hit-
ting them over the head. The
performances are true-to-life,
differentiating the series from
a caricatured period piece. The
stories are complex and volatile
while still contained in a small
space, both physically and tem-
porally. It's one of the smartest
shows on television.
- JAMIE BLOCK
5. "30 Rock," Season 5
There's a reason why this show
continuously wins comedy
awards - it just doesn't getmuch
better than Liz, Jack, Tracy,
Jenna, Kenneth and the rest of
the "30 Rock" crew. Over the
years, the show has become the
gold standard in comedy. Season
highlights included Liz Lemon
finding her favorite pair of jeans,
Matt Damon's kooky airplane
pilot character and Tracy Jor-
dan's career as a "serious" actor
in "Hard to Watch." True, the
jokes and situations are often
unrealistic, but because of the
amazing cast, they work almost
every time. When the show
chooses to go the route of real-
ism, it attacks both conservative
and liberal ideas, sparing noth-
ing from the line of fire.
With Alec Baldwin's retire-
mentcfrom playing Jack Donaghy
imminent, let's hope that season
six is just as good, if not bet-
ter, than the rest. One thing is
for sure, though - the show is
bound to go out with a bang. It's
just so hard to pass up the work-
place of 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

Of those 130 hours that the

have already been accounted for
and Rodriguez said that all of

end of next summer - about nine
months ahead of the deadline.
The most pressing results
might be the added pressure on
Michigan's head coach. It's not
just about wins and losses when
Brandon sits down to evaluate
his coaches.
"Wins and losses matter,"
Brandon said. "So does the man-

your student athletes. So does
the academic performance of
your prospective student ath-

Michigan is still one win
away from becoming bowl eli-
gible for the first time since
Rodriguez took over the pro-
gram in 2008. The Wolverines
had made a record-34 straight
bowl appearances prior to that
year. And there is still time to
impress with matchups against
highly-ranked Ohio State and
Wisconsin remaining.
"We still have a season to
play," Brandon said. "We still
have several important games
to play, that will be great tests
for our football program. Let's
just go play the games. And
let's let our coach and our play-
ers be focused on the task at
hand. And then at the end of
the season, we'll do what we do
at the end of every season: we'll
review and see where we've
gotten better and where we
need to improve."

that he would wait until after with Rodriguez, that Hoke was
his first choice.
Rodriguez was criticized
throughout his 15-22 tenure for
not understanding the tradition
of college football's most win-
ningest program. So when Bran-
don announced that Michigan
would undergo its second coach-
ing search in three years, an
understanding of the program's
history was naturally one of his
criteria. And with eight years
in Ann Arbor under his belt,
Hoke definitively fit Brandon's
requirement.
"Brady Hoke understands

Aside from struggling to

So when Brandon was asked
*q Saabout improving the Wolver-
ines' defense with a new coach,
Brandon made his intentions
clear.
Weekdays 7am-3pm "Is there a thought of getting
a defensive-minded head coach?
Sundays 8am-3pm - There's a thought of getting a
defensive-minded everything,"
M

Brandon said at last week's press
conference. "I want the ball boys
to be defensive-minded."
And with Hoke, the Wolver-
ines will get just that, as the
coach turned San Diego State's
114th-ranked defense into the
nation's 44th-ranked unit in just
two years as the Aztecs' coach.
Much of that may have been
due to his defensive coordinator,
Rocky Long, who runs a 3-3-5
defense similar to what former
Michigan defensive coordinator
Greg Robinson ran last season.
But with Long primed to replace
Hoke as San Diego State's head
coach, the Wolverines' coordi-
nator positions are wide open.
That includes the offensive
coordinator spot, as Calvin
Magee took the same job at Pitt
this afternoon.
Hoke's coaching pedigree,
however, has been a cause for
concern for some - especially
at the advent of Michigan's
coaching search when Hoke was
named as a possible candidate.
In eightcyears as head coach of
Ball State and San Diego State,
Hoke finished a modest 47-50,
with a 1-1 record in bowl games.
He also managed just one win
against a ranked team in both of
his previous jobs combined.
The Big Ten will offer Hoke
a serious competition upgrade
from the Mid-American Confer-
ence and the Mountain West, and
an offensive overhaul could be in
store - the Aztecs ran a pro-style
offense, with quarterback Ryan
Lindley accounting for -33 yards
on the ground in 2010.
And with Denard Robin-
son - one of the most danger-
ous running quarterbacks in
NCAA history - at his disposal,
Hoke's approach to Michigan's
offense could be the talk of the
next few weeks, especially since
Robinson has yet to comment on
whether he'd stay in Ann Arbor
without Rodriguez as coach.
Question marks aside, Hoke
has made it clear all along that
- unlike Harbaugh and Miles
- his career goal was to become
head coach at Michigan. And
with Brandon's hiring of a Mich-
igan Man, many alumni and
current players have reacted
positively to their new coach.
"This is a new start of what
Michigan always has been," red-
shirt junior defensive end Will
Heininger said last night after
a players' meeting. "And this
is the kind of coach you want.
Dave Brandon really did have a
process as he explained in there
and he stuck by it no matter
what everybody said. He wanted
the best person for us and that's
who we got."

that he didn't think Robinson
would play quarterback in the

into an offense that requires
him to drop back and spray

Mattison looks to
revitalize defensive
tenacity ,traditions

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily Sports Editor
March 10, 2011 - Just the
sight of Bo SchembechIer would
make Greg Mattison giddy.
When Mattison was the
defensive coordinator at Michi-
gan from 1995-96, Schembechler
was the Athletic Director and
his office was right down the
hall from Mattison's. Some-
times, when Mattison would go
into the copy room to print off
items for the defense, Schem-
bechler would see him and fol-
low him into the room.
"I would be scared to death,
and he'd go, 'Hey Mattison,
you're doin a helluva job. Keep
stopping that run,' " Mattison
said in his best Bo imperson-
ation on Wednesday afternoon.
And that's when Mattison
would melt.
"And I was like, 'Oh God, Bo
just talked to me. And he gave
me a compliment,"' he said.
Now in his second go-around
as Michigan's defensive coor-
dinator, the trademarks of his
defenses have remained the
same - stop the run by being
aggressive.
That's the reputation he has
built at stops at Notre Dame
and Florida and in the past two
seasons as the defensive coordi-
nator of the Baltimore Ravens.
Leaving one of the best defen-
sive teams in the NFL for Michi-
gan was a product of a perfect
combination for Mattison -
coaching with Brady Hoke and
becoming a Wolverine again.
Mattison explained Wednes-
day that he and his wife were
very close to Hoke and his fam-
ily - as close as they could be
without actually being family.
"When Brady got the job and
it was Michigan - I honestly
can say if Brady would've got
another job somewhere else, and
it wasn't Michigan, I probably
wouldn't have done it," Mattison
said. "But the chance to come
back here, and to be with him,
made it special."
At the college level, Mattison
has the opportunity not only to
recruit again, but also develop
recruits into great players. As
Mattison put it, in the NFL, if a
player wasn't any good, he was
cut. In college, Mattison has the
time to mold players.
There will be plenty of mold-
ing expected when Michigan
starts its spring practices on
March 19. While the offense
wrestles with learning a pro-
style attack, Mattison will be
prepping his players to take on
a tough approach in their new
four-man front defense.
So far, all Mattison has been
allowed to do is see what the
defensive players can do in
t-shirts and shorts, though he
was reluctant to pass judgment
on any player until he saw them
hit. In fact, he didn't even watch
film of last season to avoid unfair
misconceptions.
Instead, Mattison pops in
tape of his Baltimore Ravens
teams to break down. The termi-
nology is the same that he will
use in coaching the Wolverines
now.
And, as teaching tools for his
Michigan guys, Mattison can

use Ray Lewis and Ed Reed as
examples. He used to let the
35-year old Lewis sit out from
plays in practice to try and save
the All-Pro's legs - Lewis would
sit out one play and then go back
in. And Reed matched Lewis's
work ethic with his preparation
off of the field.
"I was fortunate enough to
be with players that played as
hard as they could," Mattison
said. "The reason Ed Reed is the
best safety in the NFL, is not
just because he's a great athlete,
he watches as much film as the
coaches do. Then the players
understand, 'Maybe, I'm get-
ting really good because I watch
tape.' A lot of players don't do
that.
"To be able to say I was just
at a place that that's why they
were good, then pretty soon
it's, 'Okay, that's good, maybe I
should do that.' "
The Michigan players have
been receptive to Mattison and
all the defensive coaching staff
so far. Maybe it's not exactly
how the coach acted around
Schembechler, but the coaches
did describe the players as eager
to learn and play well.
"What we have right now, I'm
excited about," Mattison said.
"What I've seen so far, I'm excit-
ed with the way they work and
their attitude - that's all we can
judge it on right now."
But can a unit that broke
Michigan records for the
wrong reasons make dramatic
improvements right off the bat?
"It has to - you know, it has
to," Mattision said. "Michigan
forever has taken great pride
in defense. And we'll take great
pride in defense again. That's
our coaching objective in every-
thing we're doing. That starts
with technique, starts with fun-
damentals, starts with stopping
the run.
It starts with not giving up big
plays and it starts with playing
great red zone defense - that's
what we'll be working on every
day."
POSITION CHANGE NOTES:
Mattison said that sophomore
defensive tackle Will Campbell
will be playing on the defensive
side of the ball next season.
When Mattison first saw a
player Campbell's size run the
way he does, the coach's response
was, "Watch him run, this is my
kinda guy."
Redshirt freshman hybrid
Cam Gordon also may be mov-
ing to outside linebacker if Mat-
tison's hunch turns into reality.
"I think (Gordon's) going to be
an outstanding outside lineback-
er because he has so much abil-
ity to grow," Mattison said. "He
plays so hard, he has such inten-
sity. It's just a matter of how big
he gets and when he gets there.
As compared to being a safety, I
think he can do that too, but we
might have other guys who can
do that. So we want to get the best
11 on the field any way we can."
Senior cornerback Troy Wool-
folk will start spring practice at
cornerback when he is cleared
to play, according to Michigan
secondary coach Curt Mal-
lory. Woolfolk has played safety
and cornerback throughout his
career.

Brandon
Dave Brandon is in
his second year as Ath-
letic Director at Michi-
gan. After a career
with Ann Arbor-based
Domino's Pizza as
chairman of the board
and chief executive
officer, the 59-year old FLtPHOTO/DAILY
returned to his alma mater with a football team in
crisis. Brandon can be tabbed as a true "Michigan
man.' A 1974 alum, Brandon played backup quar-
terback and defensive end for legendary coach Bo1
Schembechler. Brandon is also a former member of
the Univeristy Board of Regents.1
Under his leadership, Michigan promoted men's
and women's lacrosse to varsity status and orga-
nized The Big Chill at the Big House - the Wolver-
ines' first-ever outdoor home hockey game. Bran-g
don also scheduled the football program's first-ever
night game at Michigan Stadium and hired Brady
Hoke as head football coach.
Brandon represents a new type of Michigan Ath-
letic Director: energetic, highly visible and creative.
Today and in the future Brandon will work to bal-
ance tradition against innovation while leading the
charge to promote Michigan's brand worldwide.

No. 112 - the na-
tional ranking of
Michigan's defense
following the 2010
season. It's a number
that left a bitter taste
in the mouth of many
football fans. But fans
can relax knowing that MAISSAMCj N
former Michigan defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison has returned to the Michigan footb1all
program.
Mattison is no stranger to Michigan's traditions.
Before his most recent stint as defensive coordi-
nator for the Baltimore Ravens, Mattison held the
same position for the Wolverines in the mid-90s.
Since he started coaching over three decades ago,
Mattison has held posts at nine colleges -- among
them, the 2006 national champions, Florida.
After the collapse of the 3-3-5 defense lastyear,
Mattison's biggest priority is switching to the
more aggressive 4-3 style. This scheme represets
the rebirth of an era for the Wolverines' defense
- one that ideally will mirror the success of Mat-
tison's storied 35-year coaching resume.

But from the moment he stepped on campus,
Hoke has brought remarkable enthusiasmtohis job,

Earlyreturnshavebeen positive. Hokehad already

top player in Ohio who was previously committed to
Ohio State. However, Hoke's real test will come this
fall when the season finally begins. Countless Michi-

man to return the Wolverines to their

Capping perfect season, Russell becomes the
first national champion at Michigan this year

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
March 21, 2011-
PHILADELPHIA - He did it.
All year long, redshirt junior
Kellen Russell has taken one
match at a time - notching a
perfect regular season record -
but it was clear his sights were
set higher: winning a national
championship.
And on Saturday night at
the Wells-Fargo Center, Rus-
sell won his first career title
- after his 39th consecutive vic-
tory - defeating Cal Poly's Boris
Novachkov, 3-2, in the 141-pound
title.
The national title was Michi-
gan's first in any sport during the
2010-11 school year.
Led by Russell, the 11th-
ranked Wolverines (5-3 Big Ten,

11-5 overall) placed 15th in front
of a record attendance of 104,260
across the three-day tournament
in the Wells Fargo Center.
With no score midway
through the second period of the
title bout, Russell encountered a
scary moment when he heard his
ankle pop as it was rolled under
his body.
"He was very hobbled - he
could hardly put any weight
on it, but he was trying to get
through the match and he made
some adjustments out there,"
Michigan coach Joe McFarland
said. "He knew he couldn't pen-
etrate, he couldn't drive off that
ankle, so he controlled the tide
and waited for that kid to take a
shot and he looked for an oppor-
tunity."
Russell would find that oppor-
tunity, scoring on an escape to go

ahead 1-0. He took that lead into
the third period, but Novachkov
responded with an escape of his
own.
With just 32 seconds remain-
inginthe match, Russell didwhat
he does best: score a takedown
off a scramble. When Novach-
kov lunged at Russell's weakened
ankle, Russell was able to turn
him and score a takedown to go
ahead, 3-1. Novachkov respond-
ed with an escape moments later,
but it was too little, too late.
"It feels amazing," Russell
said after the win. "It's a great
honor to even compete for the
University of Michigan. All
the people in my life that have
helped me throughout school,
wrestling and everything else,
it really pushed me to be a better
student and a better athlete and
that led me to Michigan.

"And just to be able to wrestle
for them is great. And to win a
national title, I feel like I'm able
to give back a little to them and
show the wrestling community
how great of a university the
University of Michigan is."
Russell's success in Philadel-
phia was a far cry from his disap-
pointment in 2009, where he was
also the top seed, but was upset
in the second round and man-
aged only a seventh-place finish.
"I felt really comfortable
here all weekend," Russell said.
"I didn't feel nervous, just felt
excited the whole time. So that
was a huge difference between
me two years ago and me now,
just kind of growingup and feel-
ing more confident in my wres-
tling."
Redshirt freshman Eric Gra-
jales was the only other Wolver-

ine to win two matches in the
championship bracket.
Grajales, trailing in his first
match by six points entering the
final period, beat West Virginia's
Brandon Rader ina shocking pin
with just over a minute to go.
The chaos continued into Gra-
jales' next match, where he faced
the top-seeded, former national
champion Darrion Caldwell of
North Carolina State. In the clos-
ing seconds of a scoreless first
period, Caldwell dislocated his
shoulder, propelling Grajales
into the next round.
"Nobody wants to win like
that, and nobody likes to see
anybody else get hurt like that
in this sport," Grajales said after
the match. "I feel bad for him, I
feel for him."
Grajales wasn't able to sustain
the momentum, losing his next

two matches to fall a win short of
All-American status.
Sophomore Sean Boyle also
fell a win short of becoming an
All-American. Boyle won three
of his first four matches, but a
takedown by Oklahoma's No. 8
seed Jarrod Patterson with 30
seconds left ended Boyle's bid.
Redshirt senior Anthony Bion-
do ended his storied Michigan
career with a 2-2 weekend, as
did junior Zac Stevens. Redshirt
sophomore Ben Apland went
1-2, while redshirt junior Justin
Zeerip and redshirt freshman
Dan Yates were both winless.
The Big Ten was well repre-
sented, with six teams finish-
ing in the top 15, highlighted by
Penn State, which won its first
national title. The Nittany Lions'
championship is the conference's
fifth straight.

ST. PAUL, Minn. - It was one
shot members of the Minnesota-
Duluth hockey team will remem-
ber for the rest of their lives.
And one the Wolverines would
give anything to have back.
Just over three minutes into
overtime of the NCAA Champi-
onship game, the Michigan hock-
ey team was on the losing end of
the battle. The Bulldogs defeated
the Wolverines, 3-2, securing
their program's first NCAA title
and sending Michigan's seven
seniors and the rest of the team
back to Ann Arbor empty hand-
ed, all in a matter of seconds.
"It's the opportunity of a
lifetime gone in the blink of an
eye," sophomore forward Jeff
Rohrkemper said.
While the outcome of game
came down to one shot by the
Bulldogs, the Wolverines had
more than 60 minutes in which
they could have controlled the
outcome. Minnesota-Duluth out-
shot Michigan all night, but the
resilient and defensive-minded
Wolverines continually found
ways to battle back.
Even when Michigan took
its ninth penalty of the game -
a boarding call to sophomore
forward Kevin Lynch with just
under 10 minutes remaining
in regulation - the Wolverine
penalty killers preserved the tie.
The Bulldogs boast the 10th best
power play in the nation, but
Michigan was able to hold the
Minnesota-Duluth man advan-
tage to 11 shots on nine opportu-
nities and allowed them to score
on it once.
"You never want to kill nine
or 10 penalties in a game," senior
forward Carl Hagelin said. "But
today we had to do it. And obvi-
ously some guys get more tired
than others. It's tough ... I think
we did a good job, only allowed
one goal and they had a really
good power play. So obviously
some of us got a bit tired by play-
ing too much PK."
The Wolverines got out to an
early lead when senior forward
Ben Winnett scored his fifth
goal of the season - and second
goal of the Frozen Four - five
minutes into the first period, but
Minnesota-Duluth sustained
pressure on Michigan defend-

ers and senior netminder Shawn
Hunwick all night.
The Bulldogs tied the game at
one just under two minutes into
the second period and then took
the 2-1 lead eight minutes later
on the power play. But led by a
strong class of seniors, Michi-
gan kept confidence high on
the bench. It had been down in
plenty of games this season, even
in the NCAA regional semifinal
against Nebraska-Omaha.
Near the end of the second
period, junior defenseman Greg
Pateryn slapped a shot from the
blue line in front of Minnesota-
Duluth netminder Kenny Reiter.
In front of the net, sophomore
forward Jeff Rohrkemper got a
hold of the puck and back-hand-
ed it to beat Reiter on the right
side to tie the game at two.
"I think the top players just
about neutralize each other
throughout the game, and it's
an unexpected or unsung hero
that ends up scoring a goal ...
Rohorkemper's goal was a fluky
goal, but it was a huge goal."
Hunwick, who made 40 saves
against North Dakota on Thurs-
day to lead the Wolverines to the
NCAA Championship, kept the
Wolverines in the game again
on Saturday. Dubbed "Tiny
Jesus" by Michigan fans for his,
at times, indescribable saves in
St. Paul, Hunwick lived up to the
nickname and got the Wolverines
to overtime against the Bulldogs.
While Hunwick kept the
Minnesota-Duluth offense and
power play at bay long enough for
the Wolverines to have a chance
on Saturday, sudden-death over-
time was a different story.
At 3:22 into the extra frame,
Minnesota-Duluth senior Kyle
Schmidt's scored the eventual
game winner. When Bulldog for-
ward Travis Oleksukgot the puck
behind the net on the right side
of Hunwick, he slid it to Schmidt
who one-timed it to Schmidt for
the winninggoal.
"It's a tough loss," Michi-
gan coach Red Berenson said.
"Shawn Hunwick was terrific.
He gave us a chance and it wasn't
to be."
Pateryn added: "We knew it
was going to be a really ugly goal.
We knew it was going to be quick.
This is what overtime is some-
times. We knew it was going to
take one shot and it did, but it
wasn't for us."

when Soony's shot found metal,
not nylon. A discouraged Wol-
verine squad hunkered down
against the bombardment of
shots from Akron, who ultimate-
ly won the NCAA Championship
on Sunday.
The lead was finally surren-
dered in the 74th minute when
Kofi Sarkodie sank one off of a
free kick from just outside of the
Michigan box. Wolverine fans
who made the trip to the College
Cup - college soccer's final four
- had visions of Sarkodie mak-

matchup.
"Those are dangerous free
kicks," Burns said. "They had a
good look at the back post."
It would prove to be the game-
winner after desperate attempts
by Michigan were thwarted.
On its way to the College Cup,
the Wolverines trekked into
unchartered territory by advanc-
ing further than any other team
in the program's 11-year history.
But the clank off of the post
that echoed through Harder Sta-
dium long after the facility had
emptied may have very easily
cost Michigan a continued run
and a chance to hoist the cup.

Shocked Wolverines drop 2-1 thriller
to Kentucky in NCAARegional finale

By EMILY BONCHI
Daily Sports Writer
May 23, 2011 - It was the end-
ing that no one saw coming for the
No. 2 Michigan softball team. With
the bases loaded and only one out
in the bottom of the seventh inning
for Kentucky, it seemed simultane-
ously inevitable and impossible.
As soon as the Wildcats' Annie
Rowland's soft blooper started its
arc downward, everyone knew
the game was over. Kentucky won
2-1, upsetting the Wolverines on
their home field for the second day
in a row to knock them out of the
NCAA postseason.
Entering the seventh inning,
Michigan held a l-Olead, but by the
time Kentucky put its bats away,
the damage was done.
Michigan (18-2 Big Ten, 53-6
overall) grabbed the early lead
after freshman catcher Caitlin
Blanchard scored sophomore Jac-
lyn Crummey on a two-out error in
the fourth.
Kentucky pitcher Rachel Riley
tossed a one-hitter, closing out the
top of the seventh by putting away
three straight Michigan batters.
But it never seemed like enough,
even with senior pitcher Jordan
Taylor on the mound for the Wol-
verines.
Despite playing the NCAA
Regional finale at home in Ann
Arbor, the Wolverines were the
away team Sunday afternoon, giv-
ing the Wildcats (14-9 SEC, 39-14)
one last chance to score.
And they took it.
Taylor struck out 10 heading
into the final inning. She needed
three outs in order for Michigan
to force a tiebreaker game for the
NCAA Super Regionals bid.
"I was preparing my mid-game
speech," Kentucky coach Rachel
Lawson said about heading into the
bottom half of the seventh inning.
But Wildcat Megan Aull, the
first batter to face Taylor, sparked
something for Kentucky. She hit a
home run over the right-field wall,

squeezing it just inside the foul
pole to tie the score, 1-1.
Taylor tried to pitch low against
her next few batters to prevent
another long ball, but she missed
the strike zone eight pitches in
a row to put two runners on. A
hit-by-pitch followed, loading the
bases for Kentucky with no outs on
the board.
"I'm very impressed with Ken-
tucky," Hutchins said. "We were
going to make them swing if they
were goingto beat us."
Rowland must have received
that message.
Taylor rallied back with a strike-
out against pinch hitter Lauren
Cumbess, putting new life back
into Alumni Field. But Rowland
- who was 0-2 on the day - con-
nected for a blooper over senior
first baseman Dorian Shaw's head
to bring the game-winning run -
and NCAA Super Regional bid - in
for Kentucky.
This will be the Wildcats' first
NCAA Super Regional bid in pro-
gram history.
The game began as a pitcher's
duel, with Riley and Taylor each
not allowing much movement
around the bases. The Wildcats
were able to put two runners on

to threaten the Wolverines, but
Blanchard came up big for Michi-
gan to throw out runners in both
the first and fifth innings.
After the Wolverines' unearned
run put them up 1-0 in the top of
the fourth, sophomore second
baseman Ashley Lane was the
only batter to earn a hit, breaking
Riley's no-hitter inthe sixth.
"What we've been working on
this entire game ... is just putting
the ball in play, putting it on the
ground," Lane said. "Atthat specif-
ic at bat, I knewI had been popping
up a lot so I just thought to myself
to put it on the ground. Getting
base runners, as Hutch has said,
was the most important thing we
could have done in thatgame."
But a lack of base runners, fol-
lowed by a seventh-inning threat
by Kentucky caused the Wolver-
ines' season to come to an unex-
pected halt.
The Wolverines will now say
goodbye to six seniors, including
Shaw and Taylor, whose careers
have made history in the Michigan
softball program.
"We just have to fight every day,"
Chidester said afterthe game. "You
can't take anything for granted -
just got to keep going."

Hockey
The No. 2-seeded Michigan men's hockey team began the 2011 NCAA tournament by beating
Nebraska-Omaha in dramatic fashion, after sophomore forward Kevin Lynch's overtime shot found its
way across the goal-line. In the Regional final against Colorado College, senior forward Scooter Vaughan
and sophomore Lee Moffie each scored to send the Wolverines to their 24th Frozen Four.
'wo weeks later, after traveling to St. Paul, Minn., the Wolverines drew first blood earyin the Frozen
Four hattle against top-seeded North Dakota when senior Ben Winnett roofed a shot over theFighting
Sioux's goalie. Senior goalie Shaun Hunwick shined, stopping all140 shots, before Vaughanscored on an
empty net to ice the game.
In the NCAA title game, Michigan played No. 3-eeded Minnesota-Duluth to a 2-2 tie afte e
periods. But just three minutesinto overtime, Minnesota-Duluth scored the championship- inng goal,
ending the Wolverines' title dreams. This upcoming season, Michigan coach Red Berenson rat s for
his 28th season at the helm.

Men~'s Soccer
Consideringthe amount of talent the Michigan men's soccer team lost when its magimal run to the
NCAA College Cup finally ended just short of the national title match, one might regard the upcom-
ing campaign as a rebuilding season. Fortunately for the program, which has garnered considerable
national respect since the postseason, Michigan coach Steve Burns doesn't have the word "rebuilding"
in his vocabulary
But without the Wolverines' two biggest scoring threatsin Justin Meram, now of the Columbus
Crew, and Soony Saad, now with Sporting Kansas City, many are left to wonder if Michigan can
hold its own in the Big Ten after winningthe 2010 conference tournament. After all, it was the duo's
goals late in the season that powered the team's trip to Santa Barbera, Calif., including a potentially
program-defining victory over perennial powerhouse Maryland on the Terrapins' home turf. But with
Burns at the reins, it would be unwise to count out the 2011 Michigan squad. This team is looking to
prove that isn't rebuilding, but rather reloading.

Men'sBasketball
Heading into the 2010-11 season, things looked bleak for the Michigan men's basketball team. The
Wolverines returned little talent and even less experience. The team was pegged to finish near the bot-
tom of the BigTen - even Michigan coach John Beilein would be lying if he said he expected to make
the postseason.
But if last year proved anything, it's that you can't ever count out a Beilein-coached team. Michigan
won eight of its last 11 regular-season games - including a sweep of Michigan State for the first time
since 1996-97 - and rode this wave of success to the NCAA Tournament. Afte obliter s-
see in their first game, the Wolverines were one last-second shot away from taking No. e to
overtime in the third round.
The teamwill have to deal with the'loss of star point guard Darius Morris, wholeft school for
the NBA Draft, but after years of scuffling, it appears that Michigan basketball is finally back. "

Softball
The Michigan softball team made history in 2011, kicking off its season with 24 straight wins. Senior
pitcher Jordan Taylor led the Wolverines to their fourth straight Big Ten title, cappingoff her senior
season with a conference-best1.51 ERA.
At the pinacle of its season, Michigan topped the national polls to become the No. 1 team in the
country for the first time since 2006. But despite finishingwith a strong record of 5-6,the Wlveines
faltered under pressure in the postseason, and what was anticipated to be a championship run ended
in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, as the Wolverines fell to a young Kentucky squad. Michi-
gan still had a notable season, as coach Carol Hutchins took home her 12th-straight Big Ten Coach of
the Year title. Look for rising senior and Big Ten Player of the Year Amanda Chidester to lead the team
to another successful season in 2012.

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
On softball: Hutch's approach
tried and true for M' softball

By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
March 7, 2011 - When Michi-
gansoftballcoachCarol Hutchins
earned her 1,200th career victory
Saturday - an 8-3 decision over
Ball State that improved on the
Wolverines' unblemished record
- it seemed that the milestone
may be just one of many reached
this season.
After all, it's no secret that No.
8 Michigan (22-0 overall) is very
capable of a special spring, show-
ing no signs of slowing down
while traveling across Florida en
route to a perfect trip over break.
The team completed its tour of
the Sunshine State with a 7-2 tri-
umph over host South Florida on
Sunday.
Hutch, as she's affectionately
known, doesn't like talking about
her accomplishments and gives
the credit for her success to vir-
tually anyone who will take the
spotlight from her.

"I don't really keep track of
that stuff," Hutch said of the
milestone. "It just means I've had
a lot of good kids in my program
and a lot of good assistants."
Of the 1,200 wins - many of
them coming in convincing fash-
ion like Saturday's 8-0 trouncing
of Arkansas - 1,177 have come
during her tenure in Ann Arbor,
so it's clear that success in Maize
and Blue is nothingnew to Hutch.
But this year has a different
feel to it.
Different from last year's run
to the NCAA Super Regional.
Different from the 2009 trip to
the College World Series in Okla-
homa City - where the Wolver-
ines hope to return this year.
Even different from 2005 when
Michigan completed its magical
run, coming back to beat UCLA
for the national championship,
giving Hutch her ring.
But anyone who knows her
knows one title isn't enough to
appease her will to succeed - a

deeply rooted desire that she,
in turn, lends to each one of her
student-athletes.
That's why nobody should
be surprised when, after lead-
ing Michigan to its best start in
school history, after being named
to the Michigan Sports Hall of
Fame, after claiming 13 of the
last 18 Big Ten regular-season
championships, Hutch refuses to
relent. I
The words "day off" aren't a
part of her vocabulary. She won't
accept from her players anything
less than their best. Settling for
less isn't what brought the Lan-
sing native from a two-sport
athlete at Michigan State down
I-96 to become one of the great-
est coaches in college softball his-
tory.
And the Wolverines have been
creeping up the national polls.
While the schedule thus far
hasn't been filled with national
powers, some difficult challenges
await Michigan. If it can over-

come them, the ascend up the
rankings will continue. But don't
tell Hutch - she doesn't read
them.
"We don't care about the
polls," Hutch said. "You play (the
games) on the field. We'll get our
opportunity."
This weekend, the Wolverines
will attempt to remain unbeaten
when they travel to Louisville
to play a pair against both the
Cardinals and Western Ken-
tucky. In order to remain one of
the nation's few unbeatens, they
certainly won't need to deviate
from the sound fundamentals
that Hutch preaches from the
moment her players put on that
uniform.
"We're just tryingto get better
because everyone in the country
is doing the same thing," Hutch
said.
And she hasn't given us any
reason to think otherwise. In
fact, she has given us 1,200 rea-
sons to believe.

King winsAll-American honors,
falls in Sweet 16 in singles, doubles

By ALEX STEINHOFF
Daily Sports Writer
May 13, 2011 - Sophomore
Evan King and senior Jason
Jung of the Michigan men's
tennis team made plans to stay
in Palo Alto, Calif. for Memo-
rial Day Weekend. They also
had their sights set on traveling
to New York in early September
- the location of the U.S. Open -
where the winner of the NCAA
Individual Championships earns
a wild-card spot.
But those plans were cut short.
King reached the Sweet 16 in
singles - something not done by
a Wolverine in 19 years - before
falling to the No. 5 seed, but not
without earning All-American
status. In doubles, King and Jung
also reached the Sweet 16, before
bowing out to the No. 5 seed as
well.
In the first round, King upset
No. 12 Tim Puetz of Auburn,
but Jung failed to do the same
against defending champion and
No. 9 Bradley Klahn of Stanford,
the school playing host for the
tournament.
After several hours of a rain
delay, King jumped out to an
early 4-1 lead, breaking Puetz's
serve early. But the Auburn Tiger
fought back to trim King's lead
to just one game. At 4-3, King
suddenly turned on the jets.
He cruised to win the next two
games, before winning all six
games of the second set.
The sophomore's victory gave
Michigan its first win in the
NCAA Individual Champion-
ships since Matko Maravic won
his first-round match four years
earlier. King, the No. 21 seed
in the tournament, would next
face Gonzalo Escobar, a player
ranked five spots below him.
Michigan's captain Jung was
unable to reach day two of the
tournament in singles wit}- King.
Against the NCAA iglee

defending champion, Jung ral-
lied off three straight games in
the first set to take a 5-3 lead. But
Jung was unable to close out the
set twice and Klahn pushed the
set to five games apiece, before
closing out the set in a competi-
tive tiebreaker which featured
spectacular shots from both
sides.
But once the second set start-
ed, Klahn kept the advantage.
Klahn broke Jung to go up 3-2
before cruising through the next
three games to eliminate Jung
from the singles draw.
"The second setgot away from
(Jung) a little bit, but what I saw
looked pretty good," Michigan
coach Bruce Berque said. "It was
a tough draw, but most draws are
tough draws in this tournament."
King kicked off day two of
the tournament with his singles
match in the morning. King
dropped the first set 6-3 and was
broken to open the second set.
But King responded with a
second-set victory, pushing the
match to a decisive third set, in
which Michigan's sophomore
sensation never looked back,
completing a six-game rally to
win the match.
The win propelled King to the
Sweet 16 and officially earned
him ITA All-American status -
an honor a Wolverine hasn't had
in four years.
Just over two hours after King
won to reach the Sweet 16 in sin-
gles, he stepped on the court to
do the same in doubles.
Originally slated to play the
No.1 doubles team from national
champion USC, King and Jung
caught a lucky break, as the Tro-
jan pair pulled their names from
the doubles draw. Instead the
Wolverine duo played the No. 32
pair in the country from UCLA,
Adrian Puget and Alex Brigham.
Despite dropping a tough first
set, King and Jung found their
stride winning the second set

before cruising to a three-set
victory 4-6, 6-3, 6-1. The win
over the UCLA duo sent King
and Jung to the Sweet 16 for the
second time as a doubles team,
despite not playing together
since April.
Day three of the tournament
started off with King's third-
round singles match against rival
No. 5 Blaz Rola. The freshman
No. 1 singles player from Ohio
State met King twice earlier in
the year, taking each match in
three sets.
Rola claimed the lead early
and eventually took the first
set. Rola broke King again two
games later to take a 3-0 lead and
a strangle-hold on the set and the
match.
"Rola was getting to him and
Evan was making errors," Ber-
que said. "If you make a few
errors and allow yourself to get
frustrated, it quickly translates
to more errors, and today, he
didn't manage his frustration
too well, and I think that was the
biggest difference between yes-
terday and today."
With the match seemingly in
control, Rola pushed his lead to
5-0 with stellar serving and solid
returns of serve before closing
out the set without dropping a
game and closing out the match
in straight sets.
"In this tournament, Evan
kind of made three steps forward
and one step back," Berque said.
"He lostcto a very good player, but
unfortunately it wasn't his best
tennis today."
The loss ended King's singles
season, but King's final 30-9
record was the best by a Wolver-
ine since 1998.
King later took the court with
Jung for their second-round dou-
bles match against No. S Roberto
Maytin and John Peers from
Baylor.
Maytin and Peers played the

majority of the first set from
behind, but broke King's serve to
knot the set at five, before hold-
ing serve to take a 6-5 lead.
But the Wolverines responded
to send the set into a tiebreaker.
Despite fighting off one set
point, the Wolverines dropped a
back-and-forth tiebreaker to lose
the first set for the second time in
the tournament.
"We had a chance to serve out
the first set but were unable to
do so, and that was a big turning
point in the match," Berque said.
"We had execution problems
with first serves and finishing
out some points, and then we got
into a tiebreaker and one or two
points changed the match."
But unlike the first round,
King and Jung's opponent
jumped out to an early lead, as
they broke the Wolverine pair in
the first game of the second set.
Later in the set, as King and
Jung were trying to claw back,
they were broken for the second
time in the set, surrendering a
4-1 lead to the Bears.
At 5-2, No. 5 Baylor was serv-
ing for the match. Jung missed
a forehand into the net at break
point, missing a golden oppor-
tunity to get back into the set.
At deuce, the Bears quickly won
the next two points to clinch the
game, set, and the match, 7-6,
6-2.
As disappointing as the loss
was for King and Jung, Jung
ended his Michigan tennis
career with 89 doubles wins -
just one win shy of the all-time
record - while King ended his
season with experience and All-
American honors in singles.
"(King will) be coming back
as one of the better players in the
country and I'm sure he's going
to improve over the summer,"
Berque said. "I'm looking for him
to be a great player for us next
year at the top of the lineup in
singles and doubles."

TOREHAN SHARMAN/Daily
Michigan's Master"

By KEVIN RAFTERY
Daily Sports Writer
April 13, 2011 - For most
University students, spring
marks a difficult time for jug-
gling homework, preparing for
exams and solidifying summer
employment plans.
But for Michigan men's golf
captain Lion Kim, this spring
has meant balancing the addi-
tional workload of participat-
ing in last weekend's most
esteemed PGA Tour stop -
The Masters championships at
Augusta National Golf Club in
Georgia.
Kim, a senior majoring in
general studies, qualified for
the Masters by winning the U.S.
Amateur Public Links Champi-
onship last July. He finished his
Masters debut at four over par
and missed the cut by just three
strokes.
Though he didn't make it
past the second round, Kimbeat
nine former Masters champi-
ons, includinghis playing mates
Davis Love III and Jose Maria
Olazibal.
What spectators didn't see,
however, is that his talent and
work ethic translates to the
classroom.
"I think his work ethic is

what really sets him apart from
so many players that I've ever
coached," coach Andrew Sapp
said. "He probably works as
hard or harder than anybody
I've ever been around, and
that's really what drives him."
Preparing for the Masters -
and missing a week and a half
of school in the process - put
Kim's time management skills
to the test.
But if there's anyone who can
handle the challenge, it's Kim.
"It's been a busy time of
the year with papers and mid-
terms and everything," he said
in March, two weeks before
the Masters. "It's been tough,
there's no question. But I'm
going to make sure that I divide
up my practice and really use
my time wisely."
Kim, who will graduate in
June with a bachelor's in gener-
al studies, hopes to eventually
turn pro. Right now, however,
he remains focused on school
and receiving his degree.
Despite his achievements,
Kim remains humble.
"It's a great honor," he said

Women's basketball looking to
have abanneryear in 2011-2012

Swimmers win 35th Big Ten title

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
March 23, 2011 - As I watched
the Michigan women's basket-
ball team throw its season away
last Thursday, the irony of the
situation began to creep up on me.
The Wolverines were losing to an
undersized team from Ypsilanti
who were wearing green jerseys
and playing some of its best bas-
ketball of the season - on Saint
Patrick's Day. In my mind, Michi-
gan was not losing to Eastern
Michigan, but to the Luck of the
Irish.
How else could someone
explain what was happening?
As one of the last teams to miss
the NCAA Tournament, the Wol-
verines were expected to contend
for the WNIT title. The players
seemed to be focused and ready to
go that week in practice, talking
about hanging the first women's
basketball banner in program his-
tory up in Crisler Arena.
But somehow, some way, I
found myself listening to senior
guard Veronica. Hicks after the
game as she described her last
game wearing the maize and blue.
In a season full of surprises, this
had to be the biggest one.
Michigan started off the sea-
son predicted by no one to finish
in the top three of the Big Ten,
yet it finished third for the first
time since 2001. At one point, the
Wolverines beat three-straight
ranked opponents, which includ-
ed their 2-0 start in conference
play. Perhaps most importantly,
they swept that team down south
for the first time in program his-
tory.
But with the highs came the
lows. Michigan lost to Detroit
Mercy early in the season, and
to Big Ten bottom feeder Minne-
sota twice. The Wolverines' slide
toward the end of the season,
though, is what ended up costing
them a spot in the NCAA Tourna-
ment. In the Big Ten Tournament,
Michigan received a first-round
bye for the first time since 2001,
yet lost to last place Illinois in its
first game of the tournament.
That loss pretty much sealed
the Wolverines' fate, putting
them on the outside looking in
on the NCAA Tournament. The
WNIT would have to be enough,
as Michigan would extend its
10-year absence from the Big
Dance.
Thanks to the Eagles, though,
Michigan's season is officially
caput. The season ended before it
should have, but I, the usual pes-
simist, am not worried. At all.
Michigan graduates only one
senior - Hicks. Granted, that
one senior is a huge one to lose,
considering Hicks is one of just
five Wolverines in program his-
tory with 1,000 points, 200 assists

and 150 steals. Perhaps more
importantly, Hicks was the team's
unquestioned leader and the emo-
tional backbone - every single
player leaned on her for support,
on and off the court.
After Hicks' last game in
Crisler, her post game speech
moved many people to tears,
includingherteammates. "Ronni"
leaves the program having never
made an NCAA Tournament, but
the team she left behind has a
great chance to do so.
Consider how much the Wol-
verines improved this year, even
with their incredible youth. Then
consider how much better all of
those players will be after another
six months of offseason basket-
ball.
Michiganwill returnatalented
nucleus of young players who can
only go up from here. Juniors
Courtney Boylan and Carmen
Reynolds will step intothe leader-
ship role that Hicks left behind, as
at one point or another this season
they each carried the team. Reyn-
olds was inconsistent throughout
the season, but she is still atop
Michigan's all-time 3-point per-
centage chart at 43-percent in her
career. Boylan lit a fire under the
Wolverines midway through the
season in her first career start,
showing flashes of brilliance as
starting pointguard.
Sophomore guard Jenny Ryan
has the potential to be the Wol-
verines' best all-around player
and even earn All-Big Ten honors
- her only weakness is a sporadic
jump shot. Sophomore guard Nya
Jordan will finally be healthy, and
she will step into to the slasher
role the Wolverines so desperate-
ly needed late in the season when
Jordan missed due to injury. And
6-foot-4 sophomore guard Kate
Thompson used her height and
wicked jump shot to create seri-
ous mismatches from the perim-
eter.
Sophomore center Rachel Shef-
fer developed into a legitimate
offensive threat late in the sea-
son, as she ended up as the Wol-

JAMES WEAVER/Daily
verines' second-leading scorer.
Sophomore forward Sam Arnold
will most likely remain the Wol-
verines' post player off the bench,
as she can score in bunches from
both the center and forward posi-
tions.
Redshirt freshman Kendra
Seto will also geta chance to play,
as she sat out this year due to
NCAA transfer rules.
Seto averaged 10 points per
game in her freshman year at
Vermont and was named one of
the Top-20 high school basketball
players in Canada her senior year
of high school.
All of the inexperience, dearth
of height, and poor pre-season
expectations were tied together
by the mad man at the helm -
coach Kevin Borseth. He took a
supremely young team and led
Michigan to its first winning
record in the Big Ten in 10 years.
He might be angry on the side-
lines and seem crazy to the out-
siders, but his players love him
and he knows how to get the best
out of them.
Obviously, most of this is spec-
ulation, but something tells me
this team is headed in the right
direction.
Nothing confirmed this more
than the courts of the CCRB on
Monday night. Among the regu-
lars were six Wolverines, prac-
ticing for next years' campaign
less than a week after their sea-
son ended. It was 9:00 p.m. on a
weeknight and the young Michi-
gan players wanted nothing more
than to dominate a game of pick-
up basketball.
Michigan will miss Hicks, but
the team she left behind has the
potential to go far. Remember,
this is a program that has made it
out of the first round of the NCAA
Tournament just twice. Ever.
There have not been a lot of great
teams in this program, but the
future is bright in Crisler.
As long as the Wolverines
don't run into any Saint Patrick's
Day leprechauns, the outlook, for
once, is optimistic.

Daily Sports Writer
Feb. 27,2011 - Before the Big
Ten Championships began on
Wednesday, Michigan coach
Mike Bottom said that his team
would be "going crazy" if they
were to win the team's 35th Big
Ten Championship.
Don't be too quick to check
the team into an asylum, but,
on Saturday, the Wolverines did
complete the feat.
The ninth-ranked Wolver-
ines led every day of the four-
day event in Minneapolis and,
following the blueprint that led
them to success throughout the
Big Ten regular season, the team
received huge contributions
from both veteran and rookie
swimmers.
"I think that before the meet,
we're always entertaining all
these exciting thoughts about
what can happen," Bottom said
after the win. "I know I'm beat,
and I'm sure our guys are beat,
too. This was a four-day battle
and our guys were able to step
up and make things happen."
Michigan swam to a fast start
on Wednesday with its bread
and butter - the relay teams.
The Wolverines placed first in
the 200- and 800-yard relays to
set the tone for the rest of the
relay events, which are vital
opportunities to grab points.
Both teams were able to repeat
as champions of the respective
events and Michigan extended
its conference championship
win streak in the 800-yard free-
style to eleven victories, dating
back to2000.
With the lead after day one,
the Wolverines continued their
strong performances with two
huge performances from two
freshman swimmers in their
first Big Ten Championship
performances. Kyle Whitaker
swam to a first-place finish in
the 200-yard individual medley,
with junior Dan Madwed not
far behind in second. Whitaker
swam the third-fastest time in
Michigan history and also guar-
anteed himself a NCAA appear-
ance.
"Kyle Whitaker is one of those
guys who, when he steps up to
the blocks, he believes," Bottom
said. "He believes in himself, in
his team, and it was clearly evi-
dent in his performances this
weekend."
Not to be outdone, fellow
freshman Sean Ryan provided

the Wolverines with soother
individualevictorywin the500-
yard freestyle. But this particu-
lar event was much more than
just another individual win for
the squad.
Junior Dane Vanderkaay had
built a near body-length lead
over the competition going into
the final 200 yards of the race
and Ryan came right up behind
him and provided Michigan
with a thrilling fight for first
between the two Wolverine
swimmers in the homestretch.
"Vanderkaay, on the outside,
was the rabbit that didn't die,"
said Bottom, who was named
Big Ten Coach of the Year after
the meet. "He got caught by our
own guy (Ryan); it was more
about pulling (Ryan) as opposed
to beating him."
Thursday night finished the
same as the night before for the
Wolverines with a 400-yard
medley relay win. This was the
fourth consecutive relay title
and second consecutive for
senior captain Neal Kennedy
and provided Michigan with a
guaranteed top spot going into
the Day Three, leading No. 14
Indiana by just eight and a half
points.
Then, familiar faces like Mad-
wed and Whitaker brought the
Wolverines success in day three
- but two performances from
another first-time Big Ten com-
petitor may have proved to be
the highlight of the day. Sopho-
more Sean Fletcher won his first
Big Ten title in the 100-yard but-
terfly and gave Michigan a boost
in the 100-yard backstroke as
well.
"I was ecstatic," Fletcher said
of his performance. "I wasn't
expecting anything special in
the backstroke, maybe top 16,
going into it. But I was really
happy with a third-place finish."
Whitaker continued his stel-
lar rookie campaign with a win
in the 400-yard individual med-
ley, becoming the third different
Michigan swimmer to win both
individual medley events in the
past three years. He joins for
mer Wolverine swimmers Tyler
Clary, who won both events
in 2009 and 2010, and James
Vanderkaay, who won in 2008,
to accomplish that feat.
In the 200-yard freestyle,
Madwed was looking for a
three-peat and got it, providing
the Wolverines with another
individual victory and a sense of
relief for himself.

"I was really nervous going
into the race," Madwed said on
Friday. "But like we always say,
it's good to be nervous because
that means you're expecting
something good."
Michigan had a 57-point lead
over Indiana going into the final
day of events at the University
Aquatic Center and needed just
a few more clutch performances
to bring the trophy back to Ann
Arbor. Needless to say, the Wol-
verines got those performances.
Ryan brought the Michigan
faithful a huge performance in
the 1650-yard freestyle, giving
the Wolverine long-distance
team two wins at Big Tens. And
sophomore Ryan Feeley and
Vanderkaay also gave the Wol-
verines valuable points with sec-
ond- and fourth-place finishes in
the event.
For Madwed, he may look
back on the final day of this Big
Ten Championship for years to
come. Madwed obliterated both
his own Big Ten Championship
record and the Michigan school
record in the 200-yard butterfly.
Madwed was swimming with
the rest of the pack, including
Freshman Swimmer of the Year
Whitaker, for the first150 yards
before turning on the gas and
rolling to a record-breaking win,
putting an exclamation point on
the event for the Wolverines.
"I was planning on doing
that," Madwed said of starting
out with the pack. "Usually I
take it out a little too quick and
I don't have enough to come
home. I thought I would mix it
up and see how it goes."
It may have been the school's
35th Big Ten Championship but
it was arguably one of the more
meaningful ones for the Wolver-
ines.
"I think this year, with this
team, this was our focus meet,"
Bottom said. "This team needed
this victory to take it to the next
level. I think we still have some
left in the tank (for NCAAs) but
this is what we came to do."
In a fitting end to Big Ten
competition, the Wolverines
beat the only team that pre-
vailed over them in conference
dual-meets, beating Indiana by
a final margin of 74 points. As
the team prepares for NCAA's in
a month, the feeling of this win
will stay with these swimmers
for a while.
"It is just like a dream," Ryan
said after the meet. "You can't
dream anything better."

Athletes display talent, skin at Mock Rock

" On Field Hockey: 'M' will be back with
a vengeance next year after early exit

By MATT RUDNITSKY
Daily Sports Writer
Nov. 14,2010 - Don't get used
to seeing the Michigan field
hockey team bow out in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament.
The Wolverines only have five
seniors on their roster and are
led in scoring by a freshman -
Rachel Mack, this season's most
valuable player in the Big Ten
Tournament.
Mack's 16 goals put her one
shy of Michigan's freshman
record, and she can only expect
to improve on her already stellar
numbers. She was also selected
to the the All-Big Ten second
team - an impressive feat for
such a young player.
"She had a really lovely year,"
Michigan coach Marcia Pankratz
said. "She's a talented, skilled,
polished player, and we knew
that. That's why we recruited
her. We were hoping she'd give
us some firepower up front and
she certainly did come through
for us, as we expected. She's a
hardworking player with a great
attitude, and we just expect her
to get better and better."
Michigan's seniors - Vanessa
Sekhon, Meredith Way, Zara

Saydjari, Alicia Mayer and Paige
Laytos - were essential to the
team's success and will certainly
be missed, but the team's sev-
enteen non-seniors will have no
trouble filling the void.
"The junior class doesn't get
the recognition it deserves." Way
said. "I don't have any fear that
they won't be able to step up and
fill into (the senior class's) shoes
and lead this team next year
because they were already lead-
ers this year, despite the fact that
they were just juniors."
Michigan's junior class, which
Pankratz also praised, consists
of key defenders Bryn Bain and
Hannah Dawson, as well as mid-
fielder/forward Jess Allen.
The squad's two goalies - red-
shirt freshman Haley Jones and
redshirt junior Christi Barwick
- will also be back. The Wol-
verines' two-headed monster
in net allowed just 39 goals in
22 games, good for a 1.71 goals
against average.
And despite the heartbreaking
end to their season, the Wolver-
ines' campaign was nothing to
scoff at.
The team outshot its oppo-
nents by 95 on the year en route
to Big Ten regular season and


tournament titles, a 15-7 record
and the No. 8 seed in the NCAA
Tournament.
For a team who has exactly
half of its roster filled by under-
classmen, that has to be consid-
ered a success.
When asked about the team's
prospects for next year, Way
didn't hesitate to agree that the
team is more than capable of
improving on this year's success.
"Oh, we absolutely can," Way
said. "Jess (Allen), Bryn (Bain)
and Hannah (Dawson) are the
most competitive people I know,
and the whole team has come to
a point now where there is no
more losing. Our mentality used
to be: I hope we don't lose, as
opposed to this year, which was:
We will not lose this game. All
of the girls have gotten a taste of
what winning is like again, and
I don't think they want it to go
away."
Michigan will be back next
year, and it should be even bet-
ter than it was this year. And it's
already pretty good.
So if you don't think that the
Wolverines have a reason to
smile after having their hearts
broken, you aren't paying atten-
tion.

Feb. 17, 2011 - Avatar aliens,
"Thriller" dancers carrying
glow-sticks and Harry Potter-
wannabes rapping about Quid-
ditch took the stage at last night's
annual "Mock Rock."
Hosted by the Student Athlete
Advisory Council at Hill Audito-
rium, Mock Rock showcased 20
varsity and club varsity sports
teams that performed original
skits to raise money for charity.
This year's funds - so far esti-
mated at more than $100,000 -
will go to the Child and Family
Life program at C. S. Mott Chil-
dren's Hospital, the Michigan
Autism Partnership and Student
Athletes Leading Social Change.
LSA senior Taylor Day, one of
four event chairs for the SAAC,
said in an interview before the
event that the "biggest underly-
ing goal is to raise money for our
three charities."
The SAAC has been fundrais-
ing since December, and student-
athletes raised their own money
prior to the event. Donations are
also still being accepted.
Current Cincinnati Bengals
linebacker Dhani Jones, a Uni-
versity alum, was the event
emcee. SAAC asked Jones to host
Mock Rock in order to spark fun-
draising for the event.
Each Mock Rock judge -
including new Michigan football
head coach Brady Hoke - had a
connection to the University.
"Wethoughtit would be agreat
way to get him involved and make
him feel welcome," Day said.
Other judges included Jan
Brandon, wife of University Ath-
letic Director Dave Brandon, Dan
Sygar, Letterwinners M Club
president and a University alum,
and Elise Ray, an Olympic bronze

medalist and University alum.
Before the event began, the
auditorium filled with student-
athletes waiting for their turn
to perform. LSA freshman and
Michigan wrestler Jordan Smith
said he was enthusiastic about
going on stage.
"We're going to be really
funny. Probably the best one out
there," Smith said, of the wres-
tling team's act.
Smithsaidthe teammembers put
togethertheir skitinabout an hour.
"Itwasrigorousthough,"hesaid.
But other teams,like the Mich-
igan Marching Band, spent mul-
tiple days practicing each week
for the past month to prepare.
The work paid off as the band
took first place for their "Barbie
and Ken" Michigan-themed skit.
Engineering senior Kristen
Angonese, a member of the Mich-
igan Marching Band, expressed
her excitement after the show.
"The last couple years we've
been doing really well, but it's
nice to finally win," she said.
other performances were the
men's rowing team's Pokamon
skit, which included elaborate
costumes and girls dressed as
elements carried across the stage
during the Pokemon battles.
Many skits included partial
nudity. The men's swimming
and diving team ended with each

member in a skimpy Speedo dur-
ing their "Somewhere Overthe
Rainbow" skit.
"I hope our (football) players
don't come out in what they had
on," Hoke said while judging the
men'sdwimmingand divingskit.
LSA senior and Michigan
football player Ryan Van Bergen
said the football team had three
practices a week to prepare for
the event. The team finished in
second place with its "Hidden
Talents" song and dance act.
"We found a place for every-
one who wanted an opportunity
... kind of a hodge-podge of every-
body," Van Bergen said, adding
that many of the players have hid-
den musical talents.
University alum and former
Michigan football player Zoltan
Mesko, who is a player with the
New England Patriots, was also a
judge at the event.After the show,
Mesko said he enjoyed the expe-
rience and would definitely par-
ticipate as ajudge in the future.
"I thought there (were) some
surprises," Mesko said. "There
were a lot of non-dancing acts."
ESPN analyst Adam Schefter,
a University and Michigan Daily
alum, also judged the teams at
Mock Rock. It was "a great night
for a great cause," he said.
"You can see a lot of work went
into this," Schefter added.

Botterman closes
out spectacular
senior season

By MATT SPELICH
Daily Sports Writer
April 17, 2011 - At the begin-
ning of the season, one name was
associated with Michigan wom-
en's gymnastics. By the end of
the season, that same name has
become synonymous with NCAA
women's gymnastics. That name
is Kylee Botterman.
Botterman, Michigan's cap-
tain and All-Around sensation,
completed her senior season
with the highest accolades that
can be awarded to an NCAA ath-
lete.
Amongher individual achieve-
ments, Botterman has been
named the Big Ten Gymnast
of the Year, NCAA All-Around
Champion and the 2011 AAI
Award winner for the top gym-
nast in the NCAA. She is also the
front-runner for the prestigious
Honda Award, decided on April
22nd.
With all the individual atten-
tion, Botterman attributes her
success to one thing - confi-
dence.
"I don't think I'm the most tal-
ented gymnast in the country,"
she said. "But I am confident. I
believe in what I'm going to do
before I get on the apparatus,
and that's something most peo-
ple struggle with. I really value
self-confidence and the men-
tal aspects of gymnastics and I
think my mental strength has led
to a successful career."
In the moments leading up
to her final team competition,
while she was dancing through
her floor routine, Botterman was
almost moved to tears.
"In the middle of my routine

I almost started to cry," Botter-
man said. "I was like, 'This is my
last competition.' And while all
the girls were lined up along the
side I started to say, 'I love gym-
nastics guys, I just love it,' and
they all just started making fun
of me. It was kind of a cheese ball
thing to do, but I'm really going
to miss these moments."
After the Wolverines finished
last at the NCAA Super Six this
past weekend, Michigan coach
Bev Plocki could do nothing but
smile when commenting on Bot-
terman and her career in Ann
Arbor.
"(Botterman) has been the
heart and soul of our program,"
Plocki said. "This season was an
unbelievable season for her. She
missed one routine the entire
year, which is unheard of ... To
say that we're going to miss her
next year is really an understate-
ment. She's a very special ath-
lete, and more importantly a very
special person."
While many would assume an
athlete with Botterman's abil-
ity and love for her sport would
have aspirations to compete at
the next level, this will actually
be her final year of competition.
Instead she is focused on
graduation and on her wedding
to former Michigan hockey star
Chad Kolarik. The Wolverine
power couple has finally set the
date - August5.
Botterman has become a name
synonymous with many words,
but she has always been a woman
of very few. She summed up the
end of her career in one sentence.
"The ride has been fun, but
bittersweet now that it's done,"
Botterman said.

The Ohio State University
In the spring of 1835, angry men from
Michigan and Ohio lined up on opposite
sides of the Maumee River. Taunts were
made, and feelings got hurt. This conflict,
known as the "Toledo War," was a prelude
to a bitter battle beginning in 1897, when
blue- and scarlet-blooded college men
started to anually face off on the gridiron to
take out their ancestral indignation.
Bo Schembechler. Woody Hayes. Charles
Woodson. Archie Griffin. These are names
in a long line of war heroes on both sides
who have made the contest into what ESPN
has called "The Great Rivalry in All of
Sports." Around here, it's known simply as
"The Game:' While the past decade was
dominated by a juggernaut Ohio State pro-
gram, change is in the air.
New Michigan coach Brady Hoke (not
to mention a competent defensive coor-
dinator) has come. Michigan quarterback
and reigning Big Ten Offensive Player
of the Year Denard Robinson is staying.
Former Ohio State coach Jim Tressel (and
his Wolverine kryptonite) is gone. Better
yet, the scandal caused by former Buckeye
quarterback Terelle Pryor has left Ohio
State interim head coach Luke Fickell in
quite a pickle. Could this year finally be the
year Michigan snaps the seven-game losing
streak against Ohio State?
Nobody knows, but on November 26,
everyone will be watching when the two
teams lay out 114 years' worth of good old-
fashioned hate at Michigan Stadium.

May 21, 2011 - In what has
become a theme of the season,
Michigan fell just short.
The Wolverines broke a
scoreless tie in the fourth
to take a 2-0 lead over Penn
State, but the Nittany Lions
broke it open with a six-run
fifth and hung on to win, 11-8.
Fifth-year senior Matt
Gerbe started Senior Day,
going 4.1 innings and striking
out a career-high five in the
loss.
Michigan (7-16 Big Ten,
17-37 overall) managed 11 hits
and benefited from five Penn
State errors, but left 13 run-
ners on base - a problem that

has plagued the Wolverines
all year.
Penn State (12-12, 32-20)
scored in four of the last five
innings, scrapping out 13 hits
off six Michigan pitchers. 4
The Wolverines made
things interesting in the
eighth, scoring five runs to
make it a two-run ballgame,
but couldn't find the equal-
izer with the go-ahead run at
the plate.
The Nittany Lions learned
in the third inning that they
had clinched the final spot
in the Big Ten Tournament
thanks to an Indiana loss.
Having already been elimi-
nated from postseason play,
Michigan's season comes to a
disappointing end.

In its early years, Ann Arbor was advertised
as "The Most Desirable Residence in
the Great West." And while the frontier
beginnings of Ann Arbor have passed, its
desirability remains intact, thanks to the
incredible range of sights, eats and things
to do here. While the city may be best
known for the University and its fondness
for plant-based delinquency, residents and
students know that it has much more to
offer than just school and smoke. Here is
an introduction to the wonderful world of
Ann Arbor, which is now advertised as "Six
Square Miles Surrounded by Reality."

Stars such as Michael Cera, Clive

Ann Arbor to film since the law

"Answer This!" a comedy
filmed this year in Ann Arbor and
which will be premiering at the
Michigan Theatre on Friday, has
even deeper roots in this city. It
was directed by University alum
Chris Farah. Farah said that it
was his dream to film here inAnn
Arbor and the tax incentive made
it possible.
"Without the incentives, we
really wouldn't have been able
to make it here," Farah said. "It's
pure economics."
Farah added that though
Michigan is now a competitor
with Tinseltown, it still lacks
the cinema infrastructure of Los
Angeles. His team had issues
finding a certain crane for his
cameras, which he said could
have been found within minutes
in Hollywood.
Though Michigan isn't quite
Hollywood, these incentives have
certainly aided many film produc-
ers. Begnoche said that films can
receive up to a 40-percent credit"
if they meet certain qualifications
and hire enough Michigan resi-
dents to work for their films.
"You need to have that kind of
incentive to come shoot in Michi-
gan," said Farah.

Arbor squirrels get too much food from all their human interaction.

Expert: Squirrels'
odd behavior result of
human interaction
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
Nov. 23, 2010 - Though most
students were probably reaching
for umbrellas and raincoats dur-
ing yesterday's torrential down-
pour, according to Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology Prof. Philip
Myers, they should have been
looking atcthe squirrels.
"Next time you're out in a rain
storm, watch the squirrels," said
Myers, whose research focus is
in small mammals. "Watch how
they use their tails; they use it as
an umbrella. They are able to be
active almost irrespective of the
weather."
The strange behavior of squir-
rels in Ann Arbor has become a
source of fascination for both stu-
dents and visitors to the city. And
according to Myers and squir-
rel enthusiasts at the University,
their chubby looks and friendly
demeanor are largely due to the
increased human interaction they
experience around campus.
The city's squirrels have grown
accustomed to the rich source
of food humans provide them,
which to an extent increases their
chances of winter survival, Myers
said.
He added that humans' behav-
ior toward the squirrels affects
their reproductive patterns as
well. Squirrels have two breeding
periods; one in the fall and one in
the spring. When resources are
scarce, they will only breed dur-
ing one period. But given their
abundant source of food, Myers
said Ann Arborsquirrels probably
breed during both periods.
However, Myers said the
townie squirrels consequently
act a little differently than com-
mon squirrels due to their con-
stant feeding and interaction with
humans.
"It makes them act in aless nat-
ural way," Myers said. "However,
it doesn't have any detrimental
effects on their well-being."
He said squirrels have also
been known to make their disap-
proval of certain human activities
clear.
"They've learned to expect
people to feed them," he said.
"They'll let you know that they're
annoyed if you don't feed them."
Myers added that since urban
squirrels already live in unnatural
conditions, it's reasonable for peo-
ple to feed them. He said squir-
rels, more than any kind of wild
mammal, seem more comfortable
around humans.
However, Myers said, there are
some dowsides to the constant
attention given tothe squirrels.
"From our perspective, squir-
rels can be pests sometimes and
we encourage them too much," he
said. "You also don't want to get
too close to them, they could bite
you."
The food given to them also
leads to "unusually high density"
squirrels, Myers said. Larger
squirrels have a higher chance of
losing most of their fur as well as a
higher probability of transmission
of parasites.
Though these fatter squirrels
are pretty easy to spot on campus,

they've become a more visible
part of campus culture partly due
to the University's Squirrel Club
that was founded a few years ago.

Club founder and Univer-
sity alum Jason Colman said the
group started asa late night dorm
conversation and grew into a
group full of squirrel enthusiasts.
"First of all, it's fun." Col-
man said. "Secondly, a lot of peo-
ple enjoy feeding the squirrels
because they miss their pets at
home. The squirrels are the cam-
pus pets and they are cute and
fuzzy. It's also a stress reliever."
He said the best way to feed
and interact with the squirrels
is to master the "squirrel noise"
which he demonstrated by mak-
ing continuous clicking sounds.
"It's absolutely key that you
have a good squirrel noise," he
said. "Practice. Practice infrontof
the mirror when no one's around."
He said that making the squir-
rel noise, crouching down and
holding out a peanut will capture
the creature's attention, making
it get on its hind legs and observe
you curiously as it approaches
you.
Current Squirrel Club presi-
dent and LSA junior Peter Feng
said the group is still around
because it's a curious novelty of
the school and a source of pride
for tour guides in explaining the
wide range of campus groups.
"This legend keeps it alive,"
Feng said.
He said there are over 900
members on the mailing list and
speculates these students were
attracted to the group because
of how "small and chubby" the
squirrels are. He added, "A lot of
people think they're pretty cute
too."
The 900 or so Squirrel Club
members aren't the University's
only fans of these furry critters.
LSA senior Evan Begun said
he is "obviously a big fan" of the
squirrels.
"I only like the ones in the
Diag and the Law Quad though
because they are receptive to
human advances," Begun said.
He also said he feels bad for the
"scrawnier ones" in Ann Arbor.
LSA senior Scott Schwartz said
the Ann Arbor squirrels are "fan-
tastic."
"They're docile and they're
smart," Schwartz said. "They
know a lot and they're not easily
scared. I like that."
However, LSA senior Honesty
Lee said he likes the squirrels but
doesn't like the idea that they are
constantly being fed.
"They become really fat and
that's why they become docile,"
Lee said. "That's why they've
become, I'd say, unnatural. You
know, squirrels aren't supposed to
be enormous."
"I'd say they're abnormal," he
added.
Medical student Tom Michni-
acki said he enjoys the squirrels
despite their size.
"They're entertaining," Mich-
niacki said. "I think there could be
repercussions to feeding them but
they seem pretty hygienic. I doubt
they have that many diseases so
it's probably not that bad to feed
them."
Myers said the category these
squirrels fall under is "tree squir-
rel" but there are two other types
of squirrels on campus that one
wouldn't expect to fall under the
squirrel category: chipmunks and
woodchucks. The chipmunks zip
around campus at their leisure
during the summer months and

the woodchucks are usually found
on North Campus. Both of these
animals hibernate, whereas the
fox squirrels don't.

Local feel of Main and State injeopardy

Some say city still
friendly to locally
owned businesses
By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Dec. 7, 2010 - Though the
face of Ann Arbor is chang-
ing with independently owned
stores like Shaman Drum clos-
ing up shop and chains like Five
Guys Burgers and Fries moving
in to replace them, local busi-
ness owners and leaders in the
State Street and Main Street
areas say they believe the city
will continue to be a thriving
hub full of locally-owned res-
taurants and shops.
Maura Thomson, executive
director of the Main Street Area
Association, said Main Street
caters to those looking for high-
end fashion, home decor and
food. She added that the area's
success can be attributed to its
solid businesses and low turn-
over rate.
"We have quite a bit of lon-
gevity," she said.
Thomson said that despite
the turbulent economy in the
recent past, the Ann Arbor com-
munity has been consistently
supportive of local businesses.

"The past couple years have
been really tough, but we are
really lucky," Thomson said,
mentioning that this past year
saw an increase in sales for busi-
nesses in the the Main Street
Area Association.
While Main Street establish-
ments continue to attract con-
sumers interested in supporting
local businesses, turnover on
State Street may lead to a great-
er presence of national and glob-
al chains on campus.
Ed Davidson, owner of Biv-
ouac - an outdoors supplies
store that has been located on
State Street for 37 years - said he
remembers the campus McDon-
ald's that opened on Maynard
Street in 1976 and hopes that the
fast food restaurant wouldn't
survive today if it re-opened on
campus. Davidson also said he's
concerned about the 7-Eleven
location that will open its doors
at the end of the year on South
State Street in the space formerly
occupied by Ritz Camera.
"In the last few years, it's
been more national chains or
regional chains versus locally
owned," said Davidson. "I wish
it weren't so."
Davidson said this trend may
be due in part to the inability
of local businesses to compete
with national chains, which

generally have more money at
their disposal. Throughout his
time on State Street, Davidson
said he has had to change his
products to meet the evolving
demands of his customers to
remain competitive.
Despite the fact that national
chains like 7-Eleven and CVS/
Pharmacy will be moving to
State Street soon, Davidson said
he's confident Ann Arbor will
remain a vibrant city that is wel-
coming to independently owned
businesses.
"It has a great future because
there's so many people ...
between students and professors
and tourists," said Davidson.
Tom Heywood, executive
director of the State Street
Association, agreed saying he
still has faith that Ann Arbor
will stay healthy, regardless of
the apparent influx of national
chains to State Street.
"While it seems there is a lot
of national chains ... society has
more national chains than it
does independent businesses,"
Heywood said.
Heywood added that land-
lords always need tenants and
national chains are always look-
ing for good opportunities, while
independent businesses are also
looking for affordable spaces.
Heywood said he thinks Ann

Arbor businesses are able to sur-
vive in the financial downturn
due to the 60,000 University-
affiliated people who frequent
local businesses.
"(Ann Arbor) is one of the
healthiest downtowns in Michi-
gan, primarily because of the
residents and the University,"
Heywood said.
Heywood said the shops
along State Street have been
able to adapt to the ever-chang-
ing environment either by keep-
ing up with shifting product
demand or by constructing
new stores. He added that it is
impossible to predict the future
of State Street, but he is confi-
dent the area will keep its spirit.
"I think the neighborhood is
going to get even more vibrant
in the next five or six years,"
said Heywood. "I'm optimistic."
David Jones, owner of White
Market, said that in his 27 years
as owner of the store, he has
seen many businesses come
and go in the State Street and
greater downtown areas. The
turnover, he said, is just part of
business.
"Things change all the time,"
Jones said, adding that he has
seen five or six different busi-
nesses occupy the space next to
White Market during his tenure
as manager.

NEW STUDENT EDITION

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com


Even though it was founded early
in the 19th century, Ann Arbor
remains a dynamic town. Home
rn to over 100,000 people, A2 is a
college kid's dream locale, with
plenty of businesses, bars, and of
course the ever-friendly townies.
While this map is a great start
for any new student, don't for-
get that Ann Arbor is more than
State Street and South U, so be
sure to explore all of this Mid-
western mecca after you've mas-
tered these few basic locations.

State Street
State Street is probably the most oft-visited area for students, and that is
for good reason. With enough food, clothing and general shops to meet
the needs of most University consumers, State Street is an ideal strip for a
college town. Featuring national chain businesses - 7 Eleven, Starbucks,
Jimmy John's - and some local specialties - BTB, State Theater, and Ash-
ley's - State Street is not only a consumer's dream, but also a University
student's crutch, and a place that you can always fall back on if you're in
need of a quick place to head for a date, a cup of coffee or some good old-
fashioned Michigan apparel.
South Universit Avenue
To describe South University Avenue in a 100-word blurb is nearly impos-
sible, and in some ways, that should tell you all you need to know about it.
In the daytime, South U is home to many thriving and useful businesses,
including Village Apothecary and Underground Printing. At night, however,
South U is known to University students as the home of - among many
other excellent establishments - Blue Lep, Good Time Charley's/BTB Can-
tina, and the infamous Rick's American Cafe, making it the most popular
bar scene on campus. But South U is a place that exists to be experienced,
not simply known about, so be sure to hit the South U scene early and often
in your college career. You won't regret it.
Main Street
Main Street has a reputation for being a townie-dominated area, which is a
testament to the good taste of lifetime Ann Arbor residents. Home to many
of the finest restaurants and shops in Southeast Michigan, Main Street is a
unique area which students are (unfortunately) reputed to neglect.
Main Street's malleability is its most attractive feature: it
is an ideal spot for a date night with that hottie
you met at orientation, yet it's also a great
place to take your parents if you want
to show off one of Ann Arbor's best
areas. Andas long as you don't
make it too obvious that
you're a University fresh-
MICEHIGAN man, you don't need
to be afraid of the ,
N. UNIVERSITY AVE. locals.

4 Coach&FourBarber
For those longhaired individuals looking for a
more traditional, testosterone-fueled barbershop
experience, Coach & Four Barber Shop might be
the place for you. Located on State Street between
Quickie Burger and Mister Spots, Coach & Four is
best known for its impressive collection of Uni-
versity sports memorabilia. Patrons of the typical
barbershop will feel comfortable in this small es-
tablishment, which comes complete with televised
sports, raw commentary about the topics of the day
and a cheap, sharp haircut.
- JOSH HEALY

8 CenterforYoga
Center for Yoga will eliminate all preconceived
notions you may have about yoga. With upbeat
music, hot temperatures and challenging poses,
these classes provide an intense workout and a
much-needed break from your busy day. Center
for Yoga offers hour-long hot Vinyasa classes, so
bring a yoga mat, water bottle and towel for all the
sweating you will be doing. It also offers Slowburn
classes if you are looking for a slower-paced yoga
practice that won't make you look like you just
stepped out of a swimming pool. University stu-
dents receive a discount and the first class is free,
so you can try it out and see if it's right for you.

1 BTBBurrito
If it's after midnight, you're hungry, and you're
anywhere near State Street, go to BTB. Best
known as Ann Arbor's most popular spot for late-
night eats, the counter service restaurant formal-
ly known as Big Ten Burrito is a campus hotspot
that shouldn't be passed up. The restaurant offers .
a substantial list of Mexican favorites, including
burritos, quesadillas, chimichangas, chips and
guacamole, plenty of salsa and their recently-
debuted queso dip. Priced for a student budget
- regular-sized burritos for about $5.50 and que-
sadillas for about $3.50 - and happy to serve cus-
tomers in any state of sobriety, BTB is delicious
enough to satisfy the most dire cravings. Vegetar-
ians needn't worry - BTB offers veggie alterna-
tives of the otherwise meaty selections, and the
healthfully-inclined will find many (relatively)
nutritious options on the menu. Open every day
until 4 am - try it out, and try it out soon. Lastly:
get the churros. You won't be sorry.

Although she might not have known it, J.K. Row-
ling based much of her Harry Potter series on
things and events in Ann Arbor. In addition to
Hogwarts' Great Hall (Law Library reading room)
and Quidditch matches at the Arb, Ann Arbor has
its very own Diagon Alley: Nickels Arcade. This
collection of small, locally owned shops is located
between State Street and Maynard Street, and its
services range from a tobacconist to a wand shop...
er... a computer repair shop. Head here if you need
a haircut, flowers or a trinket - just beware of any
unsavory magical creatures.

Lemon Lust, Banana Split, Chocolate Cheese Cake
- with up to 25 flavors it is hard to resist the tempt-
ing selection offered by the Cupcake Station. And
at $2.50 a cupcake, it makes an affordable dessert.
This shop makes their cupcakes from scratch ev-
ery day and closes when they sell out, so you know
that your treats will be fresh and delicious. They
even offer vegan-friendly cupcakes so everyone can
splurge. Forget watching Cupcake Wars and make
the trip to Ann Arbor's own cupcake connoisseurs.

2 Bubblelsland
Amid a lively atmosphere filled with teenagers
hanging out and playing board games, Bubble
Island specializes inservingbubbletea- anAsian
beverage consisting of tea or juice with round
tapioca "bubbles" or colorful star-shaped jellies
at the bottom. The drink is served with a wide
straw so that, in addition to a sweetly refreshing
gulp of tea, you can indulge in a few gummy treats
as well. Bubble tea is oddly addicting, but if this
delicious drink still doesn't quench your thirst for
imported sweets, be sure to sample some Mochi
ice cream (the ice cream you can eat with your
hands) or any of the brightly-packaged snacks by
the register, too.
- SARA BOBOLTZ

WhiteMarket
On-campus grocery stores are scarce, making
White Market an invaluable one-stop shop for a
variety of products. The store is as close to campus
as it gets, located on William Street between May-
nard and State - a short walk from Angell Hall.
Though not quite a supermarket, the small shop
packs a large inventory of products, including fresh
meats and cheeses, produce, and household goods.
It boasts a salad bar as well as a grill, making it a
great lunch destination. However, many of White
Market's items do not come cheap, so most don't go
here to buy bulk. But if you're in need of a few basic
items, White Market is a great place to shop.
- ADAM RUBENFIRE

@o) Sava'sCafe
At Sava's Cafe, students can dine in a trendy at-
mosphere while enjoying dishes comparable to
the quality of Main Street restaurants. With lim-
ited dorm food options and the typical student's
diminishing bank account, this place seems too
good to be true. The menu is where the real ex-
citement comes in, as it contains many unique and
flavorful foods - two unanimous favorites are the
sweet potato fries and dessert crepes. Sava's serves
breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and its central loca-
tion on State Street makes the delicious Sava's a
convenient option. With its exquisite menu, un-
beatable, prices, and hip accommodations, Sava's
is a place that can be frequented daily without

3 SafeSexStore
Luring in giggling sexual amateurs as well as
kinky connoisseurs, the Safe Sex Store isn't all
candy underwear and Kama Sutra picture books
- although both products can easily be found
here. Surrounded by dildos, handcuffs and fore-
play card games, the owner confesses that most
of her customers want to seriously discuss their
sex lives, not just pick up gaggifts. And she's ready
with recommendations on the healthiest condom
(Durex Extra Sensitive) and the most effective sex
toys for customers of all orientations and experi-
ence levels. But for those who want it, there's also
penis-shaped pasta and lollipops ... just don't let
Mom and Dad see.

7 Amer'sDelicatessen
While the sub-title of Amer's may be "Mediterra-
nean Deli," its three locations - State St., Church
St. and the Michigan Union - offer a wide selection
of food. You can also order nearly any drink a Star-
bucks barista could muster, but unfortunately the
prices are similar because Amer's maintains high
quality and variety. Some menu items are worth the
splurge, like their many sandwiches with lox and
salads piled high with fresh veggies. However, oth-
er options, like their self-serve frozen yogurt station
that charges by the ounce (as if one could possess
such self control to only fill the cup halfway), can
leave your tummy happy and your wallet sad.

11 Avedainstitute
The Aveda institute on Maynard Street is a trendy
and friendly place to get everything from a pedi-
cure to a full-blown spa treatment. The pricing
for hair treatments - cuts, styling and dyeing - is
ranked by the experience of the stylist: the pricey
cuts come from the experienced professionals,
while the cheaper cuts are done by cosmetology
students. While the idea of getting your hair cut
by a student may make some cringe, Aveda em-
ploys many talented upcoming stylists. They are
all extremely attentive to their clients' needs, and
are monitored by seasoned supervisors to ensure
satisfaction. For someone with a tight budget who
still wants a stylish and well executed cut, Aveda
Institute is ideal.

- Nichols Arboretum -
If you've put any thought into Ann Arbor's name,
you'd expect the city to have some trees. Yet obser-
vant freshmen might notice that the majority of
the University's campus is stony edifice. So, when
the sparse shrubbery in the Diagcan't cure your
sidewalk blues, get a dose of chlorophyll at Nichols
Arboretum, aka"the Arb." Featuring123 acres of
unadulterated nature, the Arb holds as many pos-
sibilities as it does plants. Located on the eastern
end of Central Campus with entrances near Mary
Markley Residence Hall and Oxford Housing,
the Arb is open from dawn to dusk every day, and
admission is free to all who wish to navigate its
beaten paths or make new ones. Runners, ultimate
Frisbee enthusiasts, smokers and countless town-
ies frequent the Arb. Every freshman should visit
the Arb to trulyunderstand the Ann Arbor condi-
tion, if only to sit on a bench and breathe in some
nature ... just beware of secondhand smoke.

HashBash
on the first Saturday of every April, Ann Arbor
plays host to the one and only Hash Bash, occur-
ring from high noon onthe Diag to late afternoon
at the Monroe Street Fair. It's a holiday unlike
any other, where political agendas and the oc-
casional bout of civil disobedience converge.
It's truly something to see - barefoot hippies
from all around the nation swarming in by the
hundreds, the smell of patchouli and canna-
bis saturating the air, drum circles beating all
aroundyou. Is marijuana legal in AnnArbor?
Not yet, buta first offense for smoking off
campus grounds results in a mere $25 fine, so
toke up with the best of the nation's hippies
and celebrate Ann Arbor's most eclectic, most
historical holiday.

Kerrytown
Justbecause it's frequented by townies doesn't
mean Kerrytown can't also be a great place for
University students. Situated in the heart of
downtown Ann Arbor, the historic district is
home to a number of great places for locally
grown food, including Zingerman's and Spar-
row Meat Market. But perhaps Kerrytown's
single greatest asset - and the one University
students should look out for - is the Farmers
Market, an outdoor assemblage of local and
regional vendors selling everything from
fresh vegetables to jewelry to edible flowers.
Every Wednesday and Saturday morning
from May through December, University
students can join locals in the hunt for fresh
bread, ripe tomatoes, smoked fish, and an
array of other items.

a thing. He was so nervous.
Braylon just wanted to do so
well.
Deep down, Stan knew his boy
wasn't as prepared as he should
be. Sometimes his routes weren't
as sharp or he wouldn't look a
pass all the way in. Little things
like that tend to pop up when you
don't prepare...
After a forgettable fresh-
man year, spent biding his time,
Braylon exploded his sophomore
season - posting a 1,000-yard
season, something Anthony and
Derrick never did. Carr knew
there was no denying the boy's
talent.
Braylon figured Carr was in
an especially good mood after
Michigan's 38-30 win over Flor-
ida in the Outback Bowl - Bray-
ion had grabbed four passes for
110 yards. So he asked again for
the No.1 jersey.
Carr knew Braylon really
wanted the jersey: Maybe finally
wearing it could be the boy's
motivation to become great.
"I don't want to have to take-
this jersey away," Carr said to him,
"so these are the things I expect of
you..."
Braylon didn't live up to the
new expectations. At least, not
at first, and Braylon and Carr's
relationship took a turn for the
worse. Already, rumors had been

swirling that Braylon wasn't the
easiest to coach. Today, Carr
claims that the two never had
any "major problems," other than
when Braylon was late for a few
meetings at the very next train-
ing camp after being given the
No. Ijersey.
"The difficult year was his
junior year, because that's when
he came late," Carr says. That's
when - you know, by that time, I
had expected him to be a leader."
"I had to guide him a lot of
times, show him the way," says
Braylon's position coach, Soup
Campbell. "Let him kibw what
the expectations were. ... When
he was late for a meeting, he
wasn't going to start that game.
"We weren't going to give him
anything. He had to earn it."
In that "rough" junior year,
Braylon amassed 85 catch- ., for
1138 yards and 15 touchdowns.
He could've left for the NFL, but
ultimately decided to stay.
He was getting it ... slowly.
When Stan watched Braylon
practice that spring before his
senior season, he knew this year
would be different for his boy.
"(Braylon) worked his butt
off," Soup says. "He knew then
what it was all about. We saw a
different Braylon Edwards."
The boy dominated a triple-
overtime thrilling comeback win

over Michigan State, and showed
up Ohio State two weeks later on
his way out.
That season put the son among
the greats - his 15 touchdowns
were second only to Desmond's
19; his 97 catches for 1,330 yards
broke both of Marquise Walker's
single-season records; his career-
total 3,541 yards and 39 touch-
downs broke both of Anthony
Carter's records.
The father was finally again at
ease watching the boy play.
"Man, I was laying back, my
feet were up, because I knew that
one time in that game he was
going to take somebody," Stan
says. "I was comfortable, because
he had prepared that way."
What Stan is most proud of is
not the yards gained, not the No.
1 jersey or how some of Braylon's
exploits became stories of legend.
Stan's most proud that Braylon
loves Michigan enough to go
back. Stan did it, and he brought
Braylon vith him.
But the mood shifts when the
father talks about how the Mich-
igan community has treated his
son. Many were up in arms when
Braylon made a big deal about
how Rich Rodriguez handed the
No. 1 jersey to a freshman defen-
sive backn 2008.

EARNEDS
John Navarre found himself in this
particular situation plenty of times.
Whenever he was in a jam all he had
to do was call an audible - he always
had a wayout. "I'm just going to throw
it up to this dude..."
This time, Michigan was playing
Purdue. He looked out wide to his guy.
There was only one receiver in this
set and they had press coverage on
him. Navarre remembers, the audibles
were run, run-check, pass-check. He
cancelled all the runs and signaled a
15-yard route to the receiver. But wait
a second, he thought, "We're on the
35-yard line, (screw) this, let's go for
the endzone "
Navarre lofted a bomb that only his
guy could reach. "He went up and got
it because the (cornerback) was this
big," Navarre says, motioning with his
hand that the defender was half his
size.
Watching from afar, the father had
seen the son make this catch a mil-
lion times in the yard. The son always
wanted to practice the spectacular
catch. The father would loft the ball
high and away, just to make it difficult,
and the boy would time it just right
and come down with the ball, landing
on a strategically placed mattress.
"He had a very freakish sense of
timing," the father says. "He never
jumped too soon. He never jumped
too late. The ball always arrived when
he was at the peak of ajump. Always."
The boy savored those few
moments of joy he had, floating in the
air, because the rest of his day would
be spentdoing what other kids weren't
doing to be great, what they wouldn't
do.
The father wouldn't let the boy
play football until he knew he was
old enough to work at it, to train hard
enough, to put in the time to run track.
But the boy loved it. He chose this
route. From the Michigan practices
the father took him to as a toddler, to
the old game filmhe found on his own,
the game was mesmerizing. Images
flickered across the screen of his dad's
old teammate, Anthony Carter, and

that smooth No. 1 jersey. Ever since
he'd always wanted to be a receiver.
Now, the father would send him
deep, always running "the bomb," the
Hail Mary, so the boy would gethis fit-
ness right.
There was always something on
the line, too, his team trailing in the
fourth quarter. Catch this ball or the
game's over, you lose.
The father knew the boy too well.
He was too competitive to let that ball
drop, and if he did, the workouts that
followed stung that much more.
One-hundred yard dashes, six
in a row, with 10 seconds to rest in
between. And that was just the first
set. The boy had two more, with five
minutes of rest in between.
What would hurthmore? Those or
the 40-yard dashes he'd have to run
every 15 seconds for 15 minutes, with
the summer sun wrapping him in
blanket.
No son of Stan Edwards wouldn't
know how to practice, how to prepare.
This, when no one's watching - not
the coach, not even the father - is
when you get better.
Bo Schembechler himself had
taught the father how to be tough. The
father learned to practice out of fear
of being yelled at. He hated to hear
Bo yell. He tried his hardest on every
drill, made sure everything he did was
perfect, so Bo wouldn't yell.
He can still remember thattday...
'Stan Edwards, please report to rhe
gym office. Stan Edwards, please report
to the gym office"...when he walked in
and first laid eyes on Bo's block 'M.'
The coach smiled, shook his hand,
kind of took him by the shoulders and
spun him around.
"Can you play with us? Can you play
at our level? Well we're interested and
we're going to keep our eye on you," Bo
said.
From then, the father would do
anything to not let that man down.
Practices damn near killed him. In the
first week, his freshman year, a walk-
on fullback missed an assignment and
an All-Big Ten safety took the father's

head clean off. That was practice
under Bo.
They'd be the most, organized,
most prepared, and toughest team in
the country because of Bo, the father
thought. And it was because of the
way they practiced.
So the father worked the son four or
five days a week, so the boy could be
the best, because he wanted to be.
As he grew, the son's body didn't
always cooperate. Nature was fight-
ing the progress the father had made
with the boy, as he went through his
awkward stages at the least opportune
time in high school.
"Sometimes tthoughtshe'd be pret-
ty good and other times I'd wonder,
and scratch my head - maybe not,"
the father says.
That's why relatively few schools
were chasing the Rivals.com No. 49
wide receiver recruit in the country. It
hadn't helped that he played a bunch
of other positions besides wide receiv-
er, and his team didn't throw the ball
that much.
The son had grown up an Ohio State
fan, but they weren't in the mix, and
Michigan State was interested in him
early - they saw the raw skills he had.
But entering his senior season, the
father's school hadn't yet offered his
son a scholarship.
It had felt right all these years that
his son would end up there. It was
unintentional, but having attended a
Michigan football practice every year
since he left the school, the father left
a mark on his son.
"When he was four and five years
old, he would stop, and pay attention
and look," Stan says. "He could hear
the sound. You know, that sound.
When people finally get close enough
to hear a Michigan practice. To hear
those shoulder pads and that flesh
pounding against each other. He knew
that early on. He knew."
By the fourth game of his setior
year, Michigan felt comfortable
enough after having seen him at a
summer camp and seeing some new
tape that Brayton Edwardt4.ssn..

The son asked the coaching staff
if he could wear the No. 1 jersey dur-
ing his recruitment, knowing full well
what his father had told him about the
school.
"You've got to earn this jersey; we
don't just give it to anybody," they told
him.
This pleased the father.
All of the father's grit and determi-
nation wasn't without reason.
He knew Lloyd Carr was a Rn dis-
ciple. Carr had coached the father.dHe
knew what it would take to succeed,
if the boy truly wanted to among the

work to get there," Stan says. "You
don't play that way by a gift from God.
"That doesn't happen by osmosis.
Those guys decided put the work in
to earn the right to wear that jersey
and also play at a different level than
everybody else. Everybody is not
going to make that sacrifice. They say
they are, but they're not."
Here sat Stan Edwards' son, wear-
ing the No. 80. The coaches said the
boy had to grow up. He had to mature
and begin to really work. He didn't

shouldn't line up - no disrespect to Mar-
cus Knight andKevin Bryant and all those
guys - you and Tai Streets should be out
there," Marcus said. "All you have to do
is learn the plays, keep your mouth shut
and be a freshman. Just don't play like a
freshman."
"Marcus, I'm from Richmond, Virgin-
ia," Dave said flatly. "I don't know what it
is to be scared of anything.
"I want to do what y'all did last year."
Win the national championship.
Whenever Dave would ask Marcus a
question, he'd contort his face the same
way every time - he'd raise his eyebrows
and twitch his lips at the same time, and
smile while he did it.
Marcus saw that face a lot that summer,
and when training camp started, he made
sure to get a glimpse of it every time they
sat down to eat.
Dave's look had a frustrated twistto it
lately - he was dealing with going fromthe
No.1 receiving recruit in the country to No.
4 on Michigan's depth chart, and the rea-
son was simple: he didn't know the plays.
Marcus told him: Meet up with Tai
Streets, Marcus Knight, some of the older
receivers, and Tom Brady, and learn the
offense, learn the plays. Once you under-
stand what you're doing, you'll play. You'll
be great.
"I don't think he understood how to
compete and go from a second-team or
third-team guy," Marcus says. "As a fresh-
man, I don't think he understood what that
meant as far as climbing up the ladder.
There were other guys that waited their
turn as well."
During his freshman year, Marcus
didn't know the plays - the other safeties
hadn't had much interest in him taking
their playing time and his position coach

Hoke needs to prove he-s

knew he wasn't going to play, so there was
no sense in bothering.
"At Michigan, they don't throw you into
the fire unless they have to, so they don't
have to deal with (you) - they don't want
to fight the monster they helped create,"
Marcus says. "That's why a lot of talented
freshmen won't play, so they won't become
a star."
So Dave did as he. was told. He needed
to learn the plays, so he approached the
older wide receivers. But Dave wasn't just

any old guy, holding a number, waiting his
turn. He was holding THE number.
'I don't know if the guys he (sought)
help from really wanted to give him help,
because he was a better wide receiver,"
Marcus says now. "And it's kinda like, they
didn't want him to take their job. I don't
think he truly got the guidance from the
receiving corps, the older receivers.
"That's why he was a little frustrated
or he didn't know who to trust. He didn't
know who to go to, who to look up to.
"I think he probably got it more from
Brady because he knew Dave was going to
be one of those targets that makes a quar-
terback look pretty good. And that's where
I think he and Tom Brady really developed.
a close bond, when Dave finally went to
him and said, 'Teach me the plays. Where do
I need to be?"'
Two years later, Marcus had graduated,
but he still called Dave on a monthly basis,
just to check in. This time, he wanted to
crawl inside Dave's head before the biggest
game of his life: the 2000 Orange Bowl,
Brady's senior year. This was it.
"These are the types of games that you
showcase yourself in," Marcus said, as if he
were sitting across from Dave in Dub-Nik.
"And do whatever you have to do to make
sure your team wins. If you want to get to
this level, they rise, they perform well on
these types of stages.
"Catch every pass if you can. Go to work.
This is the type of the game that would put
you, in your junior year, at the top of the

list."
Dave didn't disappoint - he caught 10
passes for 150 yards and scored Michigan's
first three touchdowns of the game.
Each drive, Dave found a new way to get
open.
"Terrell's got another one!" the TV

announcer exclaimed, as Dave moved
Michigan down to the 20-yard line late in
the third quarter. He had already caught
two touchdowns by that point.
Brady went back to him on the very next
play, on a curl route, and Dave muscled his
way through the cornerback and ran for
daylight. Touchdown, Michigan.
Brady set a Michigan bowl record that
day with his 369 yards passing, as he led his
team to a thrilling 35-34 win. But Dave was
the Orange Bowl MVP.
Marcus watched from California. He
was playing for the Raiders at the time, and
he told anyone who'd listen: See Dave Ter-
rell, right there, that's the best wide receiver
in the country.

Brady Hoke used six words to
shift the feelingof Michigan
football.
It was in response to a question
about Michigan still being an elite
job. After being nationally embar-
rassed on a consistent basis, those
words were just
what Michigan
fans wanted to
hear.
"This is
Michigan, for
God's sake."
Hoke then
proceeded to
wrap every MICHAEL
Wolverine fan FLOREK
in a verbal hug
the past seven
months with sound bites including
"physicality" and "fundamentals,"
bringingback Michigan football and
the ever popular: "This is Michi-
gan."
The alumni believed. They told
us to believe. We did.
It wasn't a hard sell. A fanbase
so battered from staring at 52-14,
37-7 and 48-28 in a three-game span
needed some glimmer of hope. Fans
needed a leader to rally around,
someone to blindly follow back to
the prosperity they signed up for. So
why not Hoke?
He understands the traditions.
Clocks are around Schembechler
Hall counting down the Ohio State
and Michigan State games.
He's extremely passionate about
Michigan. Just listen to him talk.
He's a genuinely good dude. He
responds to people by name and has
self-deprecating humor.
Asked to describe Hoke in one
word, freshman linebacker Frank
Clark told MGoBlue.com, "Epic."
"Sometimes coaches are standoff-
ish or kind of hard to approach, but
Coach Hoke's not like that at all,"
fifth-year senior center David Molk
said on Monday. "He's just a great
guy that you put your arm around
and say, 'Hey, how ya doin?"'
Fans decided that somehow these
traits were going to help him win
football games. Without a single vic-
tory to his name, he's nice-guyed his
way into Michigan fans' hearts.
Now on the eve of Brady Hoke's
first game, he doesn't feel much
like a new coach, unproven at a
big-time college football program.
He's the son who never left, the one
*who reminds fans of the days when

Michigan coach Brady Hoke has sky-high expectations in his first season at the helm.,

Michigan won Big Ten Champion-
ships and were guaranteed a good
bowl game.
But as you watch this season
wearing your "This is Michigan"
student t-shirt, realize that those old
days are gone - at least temporarily.
Michigan lacks depth, has a few
weak spots and is undergoing a
change of system both on offense
and defense. And no matter how
many recruits Hoke pulls from Ohio
or how technically sound Kyle Kalis
is at run blocking, it's not going to
have an effect this fall.
Despite talking all camp about
findinga featured running back,
Michigan still doesn't have one.
Hoke can talk about the good com-
petition between senior Mike Shaw
and redshirt sophomore Fitzgerald
Toussaint, but if they were both
game-breakers wouldn't he say they
were both too good to keep off the
field?
The Wolverines are starting a
former walk-on in Will Heininger
at strong-side defensive end. Brady
Hoke cited experience as the biggest
reason he's starting. Heininger's ,
backup, redshirt sophomore Nathan
Brink, is a walk-on that's 32 pounds
lighter than Heininger is.
The kicking game that was so
atrocious last year returns redshirt

sophomore Brendan Gibbons as the
starter in all his 1-for-5 glory.
The punting situation isn't
any rosier with sophomore Will
Hagerup suspended for the first
four games. While freshman Matt
Wile and redshirt sophomore Seth
Broekhuizen having taken over
the duties, the shankopotamus has
crashed Michigan practice on more
than one occasion.
And just how much cana defense
that was 110th last year improve?
Michigan will win some games
because of experience, far superior
talent and Denard Robinson. Hoke
could even motivate a few wins out
of the Wolverines in games they
maybe shouldn't have won.
But we have no idea how much
of an effect Hoke and his coaching
staff will have. A 9-3 record is a pos-
sibility. So is 4-8.
Hoke's press conference quotes
don't win games. Don't carry over
what you felt into the season. You're
only setting yourself up for disap-
pointment when Michigan doesn't
reach the Big Ten title game. Be pre-
pared for anything.
This is the new Michigan.

"And I remember across those
years Two banners that crowned the
crest, When Yale was king ofthe con-
quered East, and Michigan ruled the
West."
When Grantland Rice penned
that first stanza in the early 20th
century, college football rested on
the dominance of two pillars -
Yale and Michigan. Walter Camp,
the father of football, aligned with
Fielding Yost's virtually unbeat-
able Michigan teams.
The programs were the cor-
nerstones, wrapped in tradition,
boosting college football into
national prominence.
But Rice's poem sits on display
in Al Renfrew's basement for a
more specific reason - not to pro-
mote Yale and Michigan, per se,
but two very different banners
that once crowned the crest at
Michigan Stadium.
Today, 110,000-plus watch
every game begin with the Michi-
gan football team rushing from
the tunnel to touch an iconic blue
banner at midfield. The maize

recited by almost any casual fan:
GO BLUE: M CLUB SUPPORTS
YOU.
It's now a tradition, more of a
formality, but nearly 50 years ago
it was born in a time of great need.
Bump, 'M' Club supports you
In the fall of 1962, Michigan
football coach Chalmers "Bump"
Elliott was in the doghouse. In his
third year at the helm, the Wolver-
ines were far from a banner pro-
gram -- they were hovering near
.500 and seats weren't quite as full
as athletic director Fritz Crisler
wanted.
Renfrew, then the head hockey
coach at Michigan, saw something
needed to change.
Asa faculty leader of the under-
graduate 'M' Club - the letter-
winner athletes on campus that
met once a month - Renfrew
devised a simple plan to cheer on
Michigan's men of the gridiron,
something to get their mind off a
1-5 record in November.
"We were just trying to help
Bump out - he was having a tough
time - so that's how it started,"
Renfrew said earlier this month.
Renfrew took the idea home

neighbor Joan Helmers brought
the blueprints to life. The plan was
simple enough: make a pair of blue
flags, five by six feet, mount them on
10-foot wooden poles with a maize
and blue bulb at the top and stitch a
block 'M' onto each side.
"There weren't many big flags in
those days," Renfrew said. "There
was nothinglike this - big at all. So
we had to make our own and (the
'M') had to go on both sides of the
flag."
The idea had actually been brain-
stormed before the season. Marge
and Joan concocted the idea to cre-
ate a pair of flags during a Iabor
Day camping trip, planning to dis-
play them in front of their homes on
football weekends.
With the help of Bob Hoisington,
the assistant dean of Engineering,
to ensure that the 'M's were per-
fectly aligned on both sides, the two
women plunged their needles into
the fabric one final time to finish
the flags.
"It was a labor of love," Renfrew
said. "Those galsworked on it along
time."
Later that week - with a game
against Illinois looming on Satur-
day - Renfrew gathered the 'M'
Club and the flags outside Yost Field

House.
The football team used the
locker rooms inside the old brick
barn before emerging for practice
on Ferry Field, where the baseball
batting cages are today, Renfrew
explained.
The 'M' Club formed two lines
and placed the flags at the head as
practice drew to a close. Minutes
later, the football team ambled
underneath the "flag tunnel" and
past their fellow letter winners.
"It got them fired up a little bit,"
Renfrew said.
And then he had a better idea. He
didn't see how the energy they cre-
ated on Friday wouldn't happen on
Saturday.
"We thought, 'If it works great
before practice, why not do it before
a game?"'
So with Elliott's permission,
the 'M' Club gathered inside the'
tunnel at Michigan Stadium,
joined by coaches Newt Loken,
Gus Stager, Wally Weber, Bennie
Oosterbaan, Moby Benedict and
Dick Kimball, and walked onto
the field. They formed another set
of lines and held the flags at the
end, draped over the locker room
entrance.
The team passed through,

Bump gave Renfrew a smile, and
Michigan promptly disposed of
the Fighting Illini; 14-10, ending
the Wolverines' four-game losing
streak.
The flags spent the entirety of
the game in the stands with the
athletes, flying high and proud.
After the game they were taken to
Renfrew's home on White Street,
just past Yost Field House, and
flown from the flagpole.
The routine carried on for at
least two years, and the flags
gained more attention and noto-
riety. Judy Renfrew Hart, Al's
daughter, remembers the band
parading the flags in front of them
as they circled the field.
But having large wooden poles
being swung around the stands
eventually became a hazard.
"It became a distraction in the
stands," Renfrew said, ' almost
sheepishly.
By this time, the stands didn't
have room for the flags anymore.
Bump had turned things around
and Michigan was coming off a
Rose Bowl victory in 1964 - the
glags made the trip to Pasadena.
The stands were filling up.
Once again, as Rice put it, "Mich-
igan ruled the West."

ines hadn't had an impact receiver with as much
talent as either of them since Derrick Alexander
graduated.
But Marcus had truly never seen a freshman
like Dave. His routes were so crisp already. Nat-
urally, Dave looked like a machine, and ran like
the wind. Throw in a dash of growing up in the
projects of Richmond, Virginia, and you had one
talented, tough son-of-a-gun.
"He was fearless," Marcus says. "So him going
across the middle was probably like him walking
out his front door, seeing a gang fight and partic-
ipating in it in the eighth grade. It was nothing.
"That was the last thing on his mind when the
ball was in the air, that someone was going to
take his head off. It was his ball."
The coaches promised Dave during recruiting
that he could wear the No. 1 jersey. They handed
him the jersey-of-all-receiver-jerseys:. "What
number you think I'm gonna wear?" his swagger
said when big brother Marcus asked.

needed someone to steer him. When Marcus got

RESURRECTED

DERRICK
ALEXANDER
CLASS OF
1993

Lyingthere onthe field, Derrick Alexander did all
he could to fight a truth he'd never had to face.
Desmond and Derrick. Derrick and Desmond. Oh
man, this was supposed to be our year. No, no, no, this
couldn't be happening. The pain shooting through my
knee - pain I've never felt before - it didn't hurt that
bad. Right? I'll just sit out the Notre Dame game and
be back to play against Florida State. Yeah, I'll be back.
"It was the first game of the year (in 1991)," Alex-
ander says. "We're juniors now and Desmond and
I are supposed to be the best receivers in the coun-
try. We're on the road, at Boston College, and we're
doing good. We start off the game great. I think I
had a few catches already. Desmond
had a few. They're kicking the ball off
to us, and I'm running the kick back. f
This is another opportunity to make
a play..."
Another chancetoshowoffhisgift;
everything had always come so easyf
to him.
"It'shard for me tounderstandhow
some people can't do certain things,"
he says now. "I always thought that
I could do anything, and I usually
could."
When he ran, his teammates said
it looked like the 6-foot-3 receiver
was gliding. He wore his skin like a
fine leather jacket, always comfort-
able and confident. They'd call him
aloof, his personality was so laid
back. This is why he never got rattled
- his great self-confidence wouldn't
allow it.
Like the time in high school when Derrick took
flight and slammed home a thunderous dunk on
an opponent's 7-footer, with Bo Schembechler and
soon-to-be-coach Gary Moeller in the stands.
Heck, you know what? Ifelt good enough to play
right now. Jogging up and down the sidelines, every-
thingfeltfine.Right?Coach,putme back in the game,
I'm ready. What had even happened?
"I don't know I made a cut, and nobody even
touches me and my knee is gone," he recalls. "I'm
like, 'Ah man, I'm in pain."'
The truth began to poison his mind, ruin his fan-
tasy. This wasn't how they planned it.
He had decided to come to Michigan, the school
he grew up watching on TV, to be a part of a new
passing revolution. That's what Moeller promised
him.
He met his antithesis freshman year - the short
and loud Desmond Howard - and they took a lik-
ing to one another. He'll never forget the time he
starred in Desmond's commercial for a class. Des-
mond filmed while Derrick flew across the screen,
dunking in the CCRB, doing his best to be Des-
mond's Michael Jordan. They both thought of each
other as stars.

On the field, Derrick was starting to make noise
The coaches had drilled routes into him until th
routes felt as comfortable as he was. By his sopho
more year, he wore the No.1 jersey, the one he gre
up watching Anthony Carter don, the one Moelle
made him earn after he wore the No. 40 his fresh
man year. This was his chance to define himse
and resurrect, re-invigorate, the jersey Antnon
made famous.
Well, he earned it, and to top it all off, his posi
tion coach, Cam Cameron, made the game eve
easier for him, if that were at all possible.
"Cam was a great coach to where when w
would watch film and go over things during th
week, it would be exactly - like if he would say:
this guy is standing in a certain place, they're goin
to run this defense," Derrick said. "It would be tha
way and all we had to do was look at the guy an
we'd know exactly what they were doing.
"It just became so easy for me to go out thee
and just play, where I didn't have to worry abou
what I think the defense was going to do becaus
we already basically knew. Then it was really easy
Two years in, there were no more excuses. Th
plan was set: Desmond and Derrick were going t
dominate the offensive game plan because the

W "A diving catchfor a touchdown! HOLY COW!" the

- Derrick's thoughts raced. His career may have
if ended right there on the field in Boston.
y Desmond was just following the script. All of the
passes that would've gone to Derrick were sent to
i- Desmond, and he took off like a rocket.
n "He had a lot more opportunity," Derrick says
now. "Moeller kind of changed the game plan a little
e bit so Desmond, he was all over the field. He played
e every position. I'm not taking anything away from
if Desmond. He did everything he had to do and he
g made every play he had to make. ... I just think the

e touchdowns, with Derrick watching from the press
." box. Derrick spent two months on crutches and
e when he could walk under his own power, his work-
o out regimen began - slowly climbing stairs, work-
y ing out in a pool, stretching.
He started jogging and running -
slowly, his deceptively fast longstrides
quickened.
By 1992, his redshirt junior year,
Derrick felt like himself again. A large
brace and a big scar were the only
reminders of the first time in his life he
had really been injured. Desmond was
gone now. He left for the NFL, Heis-
man Trophy in tow.
"I was like, 'Okay, now it's myturn,'
" Derrick says. "We ran some plays for
me and I was just feeling great. That
(1992) season was probably the best
season I had my whole career, when
I came back. We were doing a lot of
things that Desmond was doing-they
basically did with me the next year.
"I kinda had that same opportu-
FIE PHOTO/Daily nity, but the other guys were a year
older. They got more chances. Amani
g. (Toomer) ended up being a great receiver, Mercury
d Hayes (too). We had a great trio of receivers."
r Despite the crowd, Derrick still lived up to the
No. 1. Now he was the one making the spectacular
catches, and the No. 1 jersey was running up and
e down the field like it was racing in its own personal
e track meet.
That year, as the team's top receiver and punt
al returner, he was an All American, catching 50
e passes for 740 yards and 11 touchdowns. He also
is returned two punts for scores, in Desmond-like
fashion. His encore included another first-team
All Big Ten selection, as he racked up 621 yards and
- averaged nearly18 yards per catch in 1993.
The 6-foot-3-prototype receiver left Michigan as
al the first in a long-line of modern-day receivers who
made it look so easy. And eventually, for his own
k sake, he came to peace over the 1991 season.
r- "I don't think I was jealous," Alexander said.

What if the kickoff had gone to Desmond?

Hazel "Doc" Losh looked com-
pletely out of place - a misfit
standing among world-class ath-
letes: wrestlers, football and hock-
ey players alike.
But don't be mistaken. Doc
Losh fit right in.
Losh was an astronomy pro-
fessor at Michigan for 41 years,
teaching over 50,000 students,
including Heisman Trophy win-
ner Tom Harmon, Bob Ufer and
Ron Kramer. There was no stron-
ger supporter of Michigan athlet-
ics than Doc.
Losh picked up her first job at
the University in 1927 teaching
astronomy after earning her PhD
in 1924. She was later selected as
Michigan's first Honorary Home-
coming Queen. For years she
attended every football, hockey
and basketball game.
And over the years she had a
reputation for rather cheeky grade
distribution.
"She was the professor who
graded her kids A, B, C - A for
athlete, B for boy, and C for co-
eds," Renfrew laughed, remem-
bering an old friend. "She wasn't
like that, but we always said that."
"I've got this awful football

problem," Losh told the Michi-
ganensian Yearbook in 1978.
She smiled and added, "And D
for dummies that believed it."
Because of her popular-
ity among the athletes, Losh was
asked to speak to the undergradu-
ate 'M' Club on multiple occasions
- an honor reserved for the most
influential folk around campus,
like band leader William Revelli.
Given that opportunity, Losh
and former Michigan letter win-
ner Ernie Vick joined the 'M'
Club's efforts with the flags and
joined the ever-growing tunnel
emerging onto the Michigan Sta-
dium turf.
According to Renfrew, Doc was
the first woman ever allowed onto
the field at the Big House.
"Well, there were no women
who were letter winners, either,"
Renfrew continued.
"She was quite a gal."
On Nov. 20, 1964, Losh gave an
impassioned speech at the base of
the library steps, looking out at
4,000 faces at a pep rally - mem-
bers of the band, the football team
and more.
She voiced her frustration over
the failures of the football team,
having not gone to the Rose Bowl
for 14 years.
"Remember this," Losh coun-
seled. "Scholarship is not the only
important thing at Michigan. Go
Blue!"
The next day, the Wolverines
blitzed the Buckeyes, 10-0, to
punch their ticket to Pasadena.

ormer Michigan linebacker Jarret Irons said it best: "When
great players play with certain numbers they want to give it to
someone who has that type ofpotential."
No one scoffs at Vincent Smith for wearing Charles
Woodson's sacred No. 2. Desmond Howard's No. 21 is worn
by another receiver, Junior Hemingway, but hell isn't raised
over it. And Desmond was kind enough to share his number
with Tim Biakabutuka. History will stumble over itself like
that at a place like Michigan.
Jon Falk, the Michigan equipment manager, has been
around long enough to see his share of that history.
He's just the man I'm looking for this morning. I step into
his office, which is cluttered with memories. You'd figure
that'd happen if you've been around the Michigan football
team since Bo Schembechler coached.
My eyes wander, I'm looking for clues, trying to dig deeper
into the mystery of one of the loneliest traditions at a school
that prides itself on its past.
Why is this jersey so special? How could a singular maize
digit ruin a life and complete it at the same time? Rich Rodri-
guez had been nearly tarred and feathered over it.
Earlier this spring, Braylon Edwards, the last receiver
to wear the No. 1, met with the new Michigan coach Brady
Hoke and gave his blessing to the coach, saying it was up
to Hoke to choose who was worthy of the jersey. After he
was hired, the No. 1jersey was the first thing Hoke and Falk
spoke about. It meant too much to not take precautions.
A jersey doesn't make the player, but where would some
players be without it? Anthony Carter, Derrick Alexander,
Tyrone Butterfield, David Terrell and Braylon Edwards may
have built the legend, but it wasn't without sacrifice. A little
piece of each lives on with it. A price each one paid to wear it.
Anthony Carter was the origin. Without him, there's no
story to tell. Nearly a decade later, Derrick Alexander res-
urrected the jersey, just like he did his own career. Tyrone
Butterfield realized how heavythe weightof the jersey could
be. Nearly everyone thought he had disgraced it. Dave Ter-
rell was handed the jersey, but Michigan wasn't about to
hand him the throne. And then there's Braylon Edwards -
the boy who needed time to understand what it truly meant
to earn his dream.
Falklooks down at a white sheet of paper he had prepared.
It lists every player who's ever worn the jersey at Michigan.
"Well, as you know, the No. 1 jersey has a little bit of his-
torical value here at Michigan," Falks begins. "You can go
through some of the names."
Falk rattled off a few of them - a left tackle, a defensive
back, a kicker, and a few others. None of whom I was looking
for. And I knew Greg McMurtry had also worn the number,
but he isn't a main character.
"Now, and those were all great people," Falk says, "but the
No. 1 gotto be a great deal when Anthony Carter got the No.
1..."

ANTHONY
CARTER
CLASS OF
1982

Every day ofhis life, JohnWangler wakes
up with a sore knee. He can't run on it any-
more or play basketball. It's bone on bone
now, and he knows eventually it'll need to
be replaced. He's lucky to have gotten as
much out of it as he did.
During his last year at Michigan, more
than 30 years ago, his knee was in no shape
to run Bo's option offense, but his arm was
fine.
He had history to make, stories to tell his
kids how hethrewthe ballcto Anthony Cart-
er, the painfully shy, 170-pound, chicken-
legged, magical wide receiver that changed
the way Bo Schembechler played football.
Bo always had a soft spot for Anthony.
Maybe it was because the coach knew
Anthony needed a special touch, so far
away from hishometown in Florida. Maybe
Bo was protective. Anthony left the team
for three days, homesick, before his fresh-
man year even started. His mother prompt-
ly made him go back. So Bo took care of him
on the field, made him comfortable, eyen
called him "Little Schemmy." Like a father
would.
The guys saw how Bo smiled when he
yelled at Anthony. How he teased him. How
he gave the No. 1jersey to Anthony because
he said he wanted the little guy to look big-
ger. And yet, deep down he knew Anthony
was special.
In his first week of practice, Anthony ran
a post route over the middle, and the pass
was thrown well behind him and high in
the air. Mid-stride, he jumped and spun
his body back towards the ball, timing it all
perfectly. It looked like he was flying. After
a split second he came down, still in stride,
and kept running. Everybody else on the
field just stopped.
It was easy for Wangler to trust Anthony.
"He really did some stuff that not a lot of
people walkingthis earth could have done,"
Wangler says.
But Anthony wouldn't open up to just
anyone. He had a few buddies he'd talk to,
and that was it. Luckily, Wangler worked
his way into his circle early on. Anthony
trusted him because the receiver knew deep
down his quarterback cared about him.
"On the field we just had a connection,"

Wangler says now. "He knew
where I wanted to throw the
ball. He'd make the reception
and it'd just work. He was just
one of those guys in your life
that you really sync with him
from day one."
If they were really going
to change the way Michigan
played football, it'd take the
two of them - Bo's favorite
player and one gutsy quarterback.
The year was 1979. Anthony was a fresh-
man and Wangler was the pocket-passing
veteran locked in a quarterback battle with
the option-quarterback wizard B.J. Dickey.
It was a battle of styles - passing the ball
and the power running game versus the
option offense sweeping the college foot-
ball landscape- and Anthony clearly stood
on one side. Through the first eight games
of the season, if Wangler was in the game,
most of the passing plays were designed for
Anthony, who was the team's No. 3 receiver
as a freshman. And at first, Bo just rotated
quarterbacks, going with the hot hand.
Anthony would go only as far as Wangler
did.
But Anthony was too talented for that
to last - talent took matters into its own
hands on acold and rainy afternoon against

Indianaon Oct. 27,1979. Michigan was sup-
posed to dominate the Hoosiers and Dickey
had started the game, but he was injured
in the second quarter. So Wangler had his
shot.
Unexpectedly, the score was tied, 21-21,
with 1:31 left. The stage was set - Wangler
had the ball at the 45-yard line, with Michi-
gan's 7-1 record on the line.
Anthony brought the play into the hud-
dle. It had him running his favorite route,
a post, right over the middle. For some rea-
son linebackers and safeties could never
get a good angle on him - Wangler always
thought it was because Anthony ran just
as fast sideways as he did forward. Now he
would have to score or the game would end
in a tie.
"Throw me the ball," Anthony said confi-
dently as they broke the huddle.
"You better get open," Wangler snapped
back.
Bo took off his blue cap and ran his fin-
gers through his hair before the snap.
Wangler dropped back, faked the hand-
off, stepped up and threw a spiral to Antho-
ny, who caught the ball at the 20-yard line.
Two Hoosiers collided behind him as he
kept his balance like he always did, and
he scooted up field. His chicken legs - the
ones everyone said were too skinny for the
Big Ten - carried him past a diving defend-
er and into the endzone.-
27-21. Anthony was mobbed by his team-

mates. The crowd was delirious.
On the sidelines, Bo jumped up and
down, pumping his fists like a little kid.
The score read: Michigan 7, Washington,
6, but Bo was furious at halftime of the 1981
Rose Bowl. This was Bo's fourth Rose Bowl
in five years, but he had never won the big
game. That monkey on his back was getting
bigger. This was his chance to beat a West
Coast team, win the damn thing. And Wan-
gler wasn't gettingAnthony the ball.
"You've got to get the ball in the air to
Anthony," Bo pleaded with his quarterback.
"He's been covered, you don't want me to

another option quarterback, Rich Hewlett,
ran the offense just the way Bo liked.
Bo thought Wangler's career was fin-
ished anyway. He offered Wangler a spot
as a graduate assistant and the quarterback
shrugged him off. That type of knee injury
like that usually took a year-and-a-half to
recover from in those days, but Wangler was
going to play.
Then that summer, Wangler and Little
Schemmy worked for Jon Falk. In their free
time, they'd play catch.
Bo ultimately gave Wangler a chance in
the second game that season against Notre
Dame, and he made a game of it before
Michigan lost. The next week Wangler
quarterbacked another close loss against

"IF THERE WAS A PASS THROWN
IN (ANTHONY'S) DIRECTION,
EVERYONE IN THE STANDS
STOOD UP BECAUSE THEY KNEW
THERE WAS A GOOD CHANCE
SOMETHING EXCITING WAS
ABOUT TO HAPPEN."

South Carolina loss. Wangler sensed it: "We
haveAnthony. We have receivers. We're com-
mitted to going this direction."
And Wangler was the key to unleashing
Anthony - with him in the game, the coach
grew comfortable with the veteran check-
ing the defense at the line of scrimmage and
airing it out when opponents stacked the
box. Heck, Bo was still coaching the team,
so they'd still pound the ball with Butch
Woolfolk and Stan Edwards. But, this, this
was just a smart move.
"If you've got eight men defending the
run and three defending the pass, that's not
very good odds against Anthony," Carr says.
Bo stuck with Wangler the rest of the sea-
son and Michigan won out, riding the Wan-
gler-to-Anthony connection all the way to
the Rose Bowl.
Now, Bo was in Wangler's face, with the
Rose Bowl on the line. How dare he not get
the ball to Anthony. For the first time all sea-
son he had to make a point of it. Wangler
obliged.
"Look at the legs," a TV announcer mar-
veled. "His thighs are about as big as his
calves. What a move!"
The guy whose jersey draped off his
frame like a curtain was torturing the sec-
ondary. Then, with the ball placed on the
seven-yard line, it appeared there was some
confusion on Michigan's sidelines as to
what play to run.
Anthony stood next to Bo until Bo finally
uttered a few words to him, grabbed his
pads and pushed him onto the field as if to
say, Justgo take care of this for me, okay?
The No. 1 jersey streaked across the end-
zone, through Washington's zoneunguard-
ed, running that post route it loved so much.
Wangler hit Anthony for an easy score.
Butch Woolfolk ran for 182 yards that
day, but it was Little Schemmy that opened
the game for everyone. His stats read: five
catches, 68 yards, one touchdown and four
rushes for another 33 yards, and one defense
scared silly. He proved the perfect weapon,
capping his first of an unimaginable three-
straight All-America seasons.
As the sun set on the picturesque scene
at the Rose Bowl, sitting on the sidelines
with his team ahead 23-6, Wangler finally
allowed himself to reminisce. Wangler-to-
Carter accounted for 12 touchdowns that
season and half of all of Wangler's 1,500-
plus passing yards.
Wangler's last shot, Bo's Rose Bowl ring,
it all wouldn't have been possible without
Anthony, Wangler thought.
"I'm really glad you came back when you
were a freshman," Wangler saidto Anthony,
"because I don't know if anyone would've
known my name if you didn't."
TheMichiganDaily, www.michigandaily.com 7

force it in?" Wangler argued. He had a point
- Anthony had been double teamed for the
majority of the first half. But Bo wasn't hav-
ing any of it. No excuse was good enough for
why Anthony had zero catches at halftime.
"Force the ball to Anthony, will you
please?" Bo said. "He'll do the rest."
Had Bo really just begged Wangler to air
it out? -
So much had changed that season. But
how did he end up here, at the Rose Bowl?
At first it looked like anotherquarterback
was destined to share the spotlight with
Anthony. After the miracle against Indiana,
Wangler was in and out of Bo's good graces
due to the quarterback's inconsistent play.
Then Lawrence Taylor tore nearly every
ligament in Wangler's knee in the Gator
Bowl, right at the end of Anthony's fresh-
man season.
Wangler knew that Bo, in his heart of
hearts, still wanted to run the option. With
Wangler out of the picture that spring,

South Carolina, 17-14. That was a new low -
Michigan had lost five of its last six games.
"Everybody thought Rome was crum-
bling, the dynasty, the whole deal," Wangler
says. "Everyone was questioning Michigan
football, Bo, everybody. It was a mess."
What Bo did next fixed everything: he
rested his offense squarely on the shoulders
of a young, spry Anthony Carter.
One up-and-coming defensive backs'
coach saw the transition unfold from his
seat high above the action in the press box.
"If there was a pass thrown in (Antho-
ny's) direction, everyone in the stands stood
up," says Lloyd Carr, "because they knew
there was a good chance something excit-
ing was really about to happen."
Before Anthony, when a quarterback
would enter the huddle Bo would essential-
ly have him call two plays: a run to the left
and an audible to run to the right, if the QB
didn't like what he saw at the line.
Something shifted inside Bo after that
