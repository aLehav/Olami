ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily

Jerome M. Adams, M.D., M.P.H. Surgeon General of the United States speaks on the topic of “Better Health Through Better Partnerships” at the IHPI Director’s Lec-
ture in Robertson Auditorium Thursday.

CAMPUS LIFE

Jerome Adams sits down with University leaders to discuss health care, opioid crisis

U.S. Surgeon General Jerome 

Adams came to the University 
of Michigan campus Thursday 
to meet with University and 
community leaders and deliver 
the Institute for Healthcare 
Policy 
and 
Innovation’s 

Director’s Lecture.

About 400 people attended 

the 
talk 
at 
the 
Roberston 

Auditorium in the Ross School 

of 
Business, 
titled 
“Better 

Health 
Through 
Better 

Partnerships” — a nod to what 
Adams 
has 
called 
his 
top 

priority as surgeon general.

Before the talk, Adams met 

with University students for a 
roundtable discussion. Medical 
student Raymond Strobel told 
The Daily in an email interview 
he enjoyed the opportunity to 
talk with Adams. The surgeon 
general’s thoughts resonated 
with him. 

“The 
roundtable 
was 
a 

terrific opportunity to meet 

and hear from the Surgeon 
General,” 
Strobel 
wrote. 

“His points on health policy 
advocacy were great: in today’s 
society, we need to work hard 
to “widen our tent” – choosing 
to be inclusive and diplomatic 
when seeking common ground 
on health priorities with others 
– and remember our role as 
servant leaders in healthcare. 
His thoughts on students’ roles 
in advocacy were also timely; he 
urged not to think of ourselves 
(students) as the future, but the 
now.”

Following 
a 
morning 
of 

meetings and discussions with 
campus leaders, Adams began 
his lecture in conversation with 
IHPI director John Ayanian. 
Adams highlighted the need to 
create partnerships in health 
care, something he learned 
while serving as state health 
commissioner of Indiana under 
then-Governor 
Mike 
Pence. 

He said he could have picked a 
disease or condition to focus on, 
but instead, is hoping to look 
at the bigger picture of health

US Surgeon General emphasizes 
parternship to boost public health

Nearly two months after the 

Latinx Alliance for Community 
Action, Support and Advocacy 
released a list of demands for 
the University of Michigan 
to take to ensure a more 
supportive environment for the 
Latinx community, students 
see gradual progress on certain 
demands but encounter an 
overall lack of urgency in 
support of institutional change.

The 
Latinx 
community 

is 
the 
University’s 
fastest-

growing 
student 
minority 

group, 
growing 
from 
4.75 

percent to 6 percent between 
2012 and 2016. The majority 
of La Casa’s demands called 
for more Latinx representation 
in University staff, faculty and 
administration as well as more 
services for Latinx students and 
an overall acknowledgment of 
the community on campus.

After the list was released, E. 

Royster Harper, vice president 
for Student Life, Chief Diversity 
Officer Robert Sellers and Julio 
Cardona, 
interim 
assistant 

dean of students, met with La 
Casa in order to discuss what 
steps needed to be taken to 
move forward. Since then, the 
administration has continued 
meeting with La Casa to work 
toward solutions.

In an interview with The 

Daily on Wednesday, Harper 
explained 
the 
University 

administration 
has 
been 

helping La Casa make contact 
with 
various 
department 

members to assist with the 
University’s efforts to respond 
to the demands.

“We have been meeting with 

La Casa members and faculty 
members of the community, I 
would say for maybe at least a 
month, and sometimes twice 
a day,” Harper said. “Going 
through what the concerns are 
and, in some cases bringing 
people in to help us understand 
what we’re currently doing.”

LSA 
junior 
Yezeñia 

Sandoval, 
external 
director 

for 
La 
Casa, 
highlighted 

the 
administration’s 
timely 

response to the list of demands 
and lauded the administration’s 
plan 
to 
get 
La 
Casa 

representatives communicating 
with directors from different 
departments.

“After 
we 
released 
the 

demands, the University was 
quick to set up meetings, 
especially Royster and Sellers,” 
Sandoval said. “The meeting 
was just kind of to get a better 
understanding of what the 
demands actually meant, what 
details were in them, and set up 

a series of demands that would 
follow them up. We also would 
get people from those actual 
offices and departments to sit in 
a room with us.”

Harper explained another 

aspect of these meetings was 
to look at the Campus Climate 
survey by Office of Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion in order 
to 
better 
understand 
what 

challenges Latinx students face 
on campus.

Sandoval touched on some 

of 
the 
positive 
outcomes 

from 
conversations 
with 

The Bias Response Team, 

Center for Campus Involvement 
and 
the 
Expect 
Respect 

community gathered Thursday 
afternoon 
in 
the 
Michigan 

League to discuss the impact of 
bias incidents on the University of 
Michigan campus, and effective 
responses 
that 
students 
and 

administration can take after bias 
incidents occur. 

According to BRT, the term 

“bias incident” refers to any 
conduct 
that 
discriminates, 

excludes or harasses anyone 
based on an identity. Currently, 
students can report bias incidents 
anonymously 
online 
and 
by 

phone.

Many students who attended 

the event specifically mentioned 
the recent incident in which 
University 
student, 
Lauren 

Fokken, 
an 
LSA 
sophomore, 

posted a Snapchat in a black 
face mask, and captioned it 
“#blacklivesmatter.”

LSA senior Jordan Jackson, 

Fokken’s co-worker at Victors 
cafe in Mosher-Jordan Residence 
Hall,

In November 2016, during 

the 2016 presidential election 
campaign, Muslim Americans 
and the mosques in which they 
worshipped were victims to 
dozens of attacks, followed by 
Islamophobic 
rhetoric 
from 

then-Republican 
presidential 

candidates 
Ben 
Carson 
and 

Donald Trump. These events 
helped 
ignite 
a 
firestorm 

of 
Islamophobic 
rhetoric 

nationwide, 
leading 
to 
the 

formation of the Islamophobia 
Working Group on the University 
of Michigan campus.

On 
Thursday, 
the 
Islamophobia 

Working Group celebrated their 
second anniversary with the 
event, “Restructuring Academia 
and Student Life” at the Harlan 
Hatcher 
Graduate 
Library 

Gallery. Prof. Evelyn Alsultany, 
director of the Arab and Muslim 
American 
Studies 
Program, 

mediated the event.

The same harmful rhetoric 

affected the University’s campus, 
Alsultany noted. She recounted 
the experience of LSA senior Jad 
Elharake, a panelist at the event,

ROSEANNE CHAO/Daily

Kumi 
Naidoo, 
newly-

appointed secretary general of 
Amnesty International, gave a 
talk at the Ford School of Public 
Policy Thursday afternoon on 
economic inequality, climate 
change and the role the U.S. 
plays in global justice. Naidoo, 
a South African human rights 
activist, 
will 
succeed 
Salil 

Shetty in August 2018, who has 
been secretary general since 
2010.

Naidoo began his talk by 

addressing 
the 
concept 
of 

creative 
maladjustment, 
an 

idea that was also emphasized 
by civil rights activist Martin 
Luther King Jr. After showing 
a clip of King’s 1963 speech on 
the concept, Naidoo suggested 
humans 
have 
become 
too 

well-adjusted 
to 
economic 

inequality across the world, 
and 
maladjustment 
would 

be necessary to push global 
change.

“One of the challenges for 

public leadership and public 
policy is whether we have the 
courage to analyze the problems 
without sanitizing what the 
problems actually are,” Naidoo 
said. “And speaking true to 
power, whether it makes some 
in power lose that power.”

Naidoo returned to the issue 

of income inequality, giving a 
personal example of how easy it 
can be to become well-adjusted 
to 
inequality. 
Naidoo 
had 

been heavily involved in anti-
apartheid activities in South 
Africa, and after apartheid 
ended, 
many 
organizations 

offered positions and equity 
to well-educated Black South 
Africans out of pressure to 
be 
inclusive 
and 
provide 

equal opportunity. Several of 
Naidoo’s friends accepted these 
positions, rocketing into higher 
socioeconomic 
class 
levels, 

while Naidoo turned down 
offers, trying instead to direct 
equity given to nonprofits.

“We looked at them and said, 

‘Hang on, if you give us that 
10 percent equity, that’s not

care.

“I could have picked a 

disease … And we could have 
moved the needle on that issue 
in a meaningful way,” he said. 
“But we really want to move 
upstream, and that’s why my 
motto is better health through 
better partnerships, and why 
I’m focused on forging those 
partnerships.”

The economic side of health 

care is also a primary focus of 
Adams’s; he sees health care 
issues as deeply connected to 
economic issues, which most 
voters focus on.

“It’s more a discussion about 

jobs and the economy,” Adams 
said. “People can’t pay their 
bills if they’re going bankrupt 
trying to pay their medical 
bills … And we know that 
communities that are healthier 

are more prosperous.”

Adams, 
who 
previously 

served 
as 
chair 
of 
the 

Professional 
Diversity 

Committee for the American 
Society of Anesthesiologists, 
also discussed the need to 
promote diversity in health 
care professions. To Adams, 
diversity and equality need to 
be framed in a way that shows 
how both are beneficial.

“When 
you 
have 

those 
conversations, 
you 

automatically group yourself 
into one of two groups,” Adams 
said. “Are you oppressed, or are 
you the oppressor? We need to 
be able to have a conversation 
with individuals that shows 
them how they all fit under 
the tent. I believe there’s a 
case to be made in almost 
every situation that diversity 
helps everybody, that lowering 
disparities helps everybody. 
But we need to be better about 
making that case.”

Three panelists also joined 

Adams and Ayanian to further 
discuss partnerships in public 
health and how they can help 
address the nation’s growing 
opioid 
epidemic. 
Panelist 

Chad 
Brummett, 
director 

of clinical research in the 
University’s 
Department 
of 

Anesthesiology, mentioned his 
unit’s preventative approach 
to the issue.

“We’re 
really 
focused 

initially on keeping people 
healthy and instead of talking 
about what to do with the 
chronic opioid user before 
surgery, which is an inherently 
challenging problem, want to 
take people that are not using 
opioids and make sure they’re 
not going down that path,” 
Brummett said.

Adams 
emphasized 
his 

support for this plan, saying it 
needs to be accompanied with 
open dialogues and changes in 
perspective.

“There’s 
a 
role 
on 
the 

provider 
side 
of 
meeting 

a demand for a pill to 
fix 
everything, 
meeting 

a demand for opioids as 
opposed 
to 
alternatives,” 

he 
said. 
“And 
we 
need 

to 
have 
a 
change 
in 

perspective. We need you 
all to have discussions in 
your communities, at your 
boardroom tables, at your 
break room tables, at your 
dinner tables, about how 
dangerous these medications 
can be.”

The conversation made its 

way back to the central idea of 
partnerships when Rebecca 
Cunningham, professor and 
director of the University 
Injury Center, discussed how 
the center partnered with 
law enforcement officials to 
come up with collaborative 
solutions to drug trafficking. 
She’s 
hopeful 
this 

partnership could help in 
future crises.

“I think the lessons we 

learn 
now 
about 
opioids 

will 
help 
us 
down 
the 

road,” 
Cunningham 
said. 

“There’s lessons that were 
learned during the cocaine 
epidemic 
and 
the 
HIV 

epidemic and I think that 
the things we’re learning 
now 
with 
the 
opioid 

epidemic that may help us 
with the firearm epidemic.”

The 
panelists 
then 

segued into their views 
on gun control, in light 
of last month’s Parkland, 
Fla., shooting at Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas High 
School. All agreed that, as 
the second-highest cause 
of death for children in the 
U.S. and the leading cause 
of death for Black children, 
gun violence is a major 
public health issue.

According 
to 

Cunningham, 
collecting 

information is a crucial 
step to coming up with 
solutions — second only to 
finding common ground in 
the increasingly polarized 
gun control debate.

“We have to find some 

common 
ground 
around 

it,” Cunningham said. “I 
think the kids in Parkland 
have helped some with the 
debate around that … If we 
can start with that ground-
level 
piece, 
and 
then 

the science and injury-
prevention person in me 
says what do we know? And 
we realize pretty quickly 
that we don’t have a lot of 
data about what we know 
and what we don’t know.”

Adams 
chimed 
in, 

explaining he doesn’t like 
to use the phrase “gun 
control,” opting instead for 
“gun safety.”

“Our 
country 
was 

founded by people who did 
not want to be controlled,” 
he said.

Before the talk, audience 

member Lukonde Mulenga, 
a Public Health graduate 
student, pointed out the 
fine line Adams has to walk 
as a public health servant

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA freshman Sayali 
Amin wrote about the problems students in the school of LSA have 
been experiencing with their academic advisers.

“(The story) just occurred to me because advising is important when 
you pick classes or when you have questions on campus. I just wanted 
to know how people felt about it and what kind of issues they had, 
what things they found positive. After reporting, I feel like it’s very hit 
or miss and mixed. It can be a good experience, a bad experience, or it 
could be a little bit of shopping around, finding an adviser that works 
for you.”

LSA freshman Sayali Amin, “Students have mixed feedback for LSA 
advisers”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
When students have a chance to pause and to think 

about it and to think about their interests and to test out 
some possibilities, they discover they have a passion for 
something else and that they want ot make their 
contribution in a different way. This is really designed to 
have us pause.“

and government official.

“I know he has a special 

relationship where he is — 
he’s the public health officer 
for the entire nation, but he 
also has to work with the 
government,” she said.

Following this discussion, 

the 
panel 
took 
questions 

from attendees. In response 
to a question about universal 
access to health care and 
addiction treatment, panelist 
Joneigh 
Khaldun, 
director 

and health officer of Detroit 
Health Services, said doctors 
and communities need to 
focus 
on 
meeting 
people 

where they are.

“I 
think, 
wherever 
the 

system, and I say system very 
broadly, is reaching hands and 
reaching people … How can 

we support people wherever 
they are so they can get access 
to the treatment that they 
need?” she said.

The lecture ended with a 

performance of two original 
songs from School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance students, 
which were written after 
talking to families that had 
been 
directly 
affected 
by 

the opioid crisis. After the 
performance, Adams closed 
the event with a message of 
optimism.

“I’m 
convinced 
there 

is hope,” Adams said. “In 
Massachusetts, they turned 
around their overdose rates, 
and in Rhode Island, they 
turned around their overdose 
rates … How’d they do it? They 
did it through collaboration 
and partnerships.”

The event began with two 

representatives from Counseling 
and Psychological Services, who 
provided 
information 
about 

CAPS availability to all students, 
and the importance of utilizing 
these mental health resources in 
any situation in which a student 
feels necessary.

Brooke 
Harris, 
a 

BRT 
coordinator, 
first 

distinguished bias incidents 
from 
hate 
crimes. 
Harris 

outlined how the Division of 
Public Safety and Security 
and the Ann Arbor Police 
Department act as proper 
authorities in handling hate 
crimes, which pose a direct 
physical threat. In contrast, 
bias incidents more loosely 
include 
any 
conduct 
that 

discriminates against anyone 
based on identity without 
immediate 
danger. 
These 

occurrences are handled by 
BRT.

Harris used the incident 

in which racial slurs were 
written on the West Quad 
Residence Hall rooms of LSA 
sophomore 
Travon 
Stearns 

and other students last fall as 
an example of an occurrence 
handled by the BRT.

Evelyn 
Galvan, 
a 
BRT 

coordinator, 
explained 
the 

logistical case management of 
bias incidents and the hands-
on role of the team to help 
students feel that they are part 
of a supportive community on 
campus. Galvan highlighted 
the team’s goal to talk to the 
offender in order to facilitate 
an educational conversation, 
while 
also 
striving 
to 

restore 
harm 
holistically 

in the campus community, 
rather than solely with the 
individuals involved in that 
incident.

Response 
plans 
to 
bias 

incidents 
are 
implemented 

based on a meeting between a 

team member, the reporter of 
the incident and the impacted 
persons. 
Additionally, 
to 

ensure 
transparency, 
the 

bias response team updates 
a weekly log of incidents and 
response actions.

“We want U-M to be a place 

for students to grow and thrive 
where they are,” Galvan said.

Later, 
Thomas 
Dickens, 

manager for the Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion plan 
program, highlighted CAPS 
and bias incident data, citing 
the fact that 39.5 percent 
of the 4,446 student CAPS 
requests were submitted by 
students of color in relation to 
bias incidents. He explained 
how 
students 
have 
an 

expressed need to have a safe 
space to learn without being 
targeted for having visible 
characteristics.

Dickens 
and 
the 
other 

facilitators emphasized the 
importance 
of 
detailing 

explicit information regarding 
these incidents, when students 
are comfortable, in order to 
effectively 
handle 
specific 

incidents and campus-wide 
overarching problems.

“Any and all reports are 

very important, if we start to 
notice that there is a trend, a 
significant amount of reports 
from a certain class, dorm or 
student 
organization, 
that 

gives us indication that we 
need to reach out there,” 
Dickens said.

LSA junior Kayla McKinney, 

secretary of the Black Student 
Union, said she came to the 
event to spread the information 
about reporting bias incidents 
to students in her community. 
McKinney cited the recent 
incident as an opportunity to 
encourage more reporting of 
bias incidents.

“We felt like it was important 

to 
send 
representatives 

here, so that way we can 
take 
this 
information, 

and provide it back to the 
community, especially after 
the Snapchat incident,” she 
said. “People want to know 
how bias reporting works, 
what happens after. I’m the 
secretary, so it’s my job to 
form things like newsletters, 
so I can send an email about 
all the information I learned 
here today.”

who in 2015 sent an email to 
the University’s administration 
bringing attention to attacks 
against Arab students on campus.

“Jad Elharake … mentioned 

in the email that someone had 
posted comments on the Yemeni 
Students’ Association account 
that associated them with ISIS,” 
she said.

The Islamophobia Working 

Group was soon founded in 
response to Islamophobic attacks 
like these, and was constructed 
by students, faculty and staff 
hoping to improve the climate on 
campus.

The 
IWG 
advocates 
for 

all 
students 
affected 
by 

Islamophobia — most of the 
panelists focused on issues faced 
by Arab students.

Alsultany then shifted the 

event to a panel of four current 
and former members of the 
Islamophobia Working Group. 
Elharake began by discussing 

recent efforts by the #WeExist 
campaign to implement a box 
for Middle Eastern and North 
African students on University 
demographic surveys.

University 
census 
surveys 

currently lack a box to indicate 
that a student, faculty or staff 
member is of Middle Eastern 
or North African descent, and 
current 
U.S. 
census 
surveys 

lack the same box. Without 
the box, Elharake pointed out, 
appropriate data pertaining to the 
Arab community is impossible to 
obtain.

“The idea of #WeExist is that 

we did not exist before,” he said.

On Feb. 21, Elharake noted, 

CSG passed a resolution in 
support of the creation of an 
ME/NA checkbox on University 
surveys for students. Now efforts 
have turned to implementation, 
as the state of Michigan still lacks 
a checkbox for people of Middle 
Eastern 
and 
North 
African 

descent, and extending the same 
recognition to faculty and staff.

administrators. 
For 
instance, 

La Casa had a chance to speak 
with the director of dining at the 
University establishing a more 
inclusive dining experience for 
Latinx students through a new 
bus tour program.

“From the meetings I have 

attended — one was about dining 
— and we had the director of 
dining sit with us and talk about 
how we can make dining more 
inclusive and authentic and one 
thing proposed was bus tours to 
local restaurants in Detroit and 
to local areas so students can try 
the food and give feedback on 
dining,” Sandoval said.

Additionally, 
the 

administration and La Casa 
have started discussing outreach 
programs directed at the needs 
of the Latinx community.

Harper praised the efforts 

of the students from La Casa, 
and 
appreciated 
their 
work 

to establish a more inclusive 
campus. She also pointed out 
the administration’s willingness 
to create new solutions for the 
issues raised by La Casa’s list of 
demands.

“It would be premature for 

me to say this is where we are 
because we are in the process 
of figuring out together where 
we are,” Harper said. “I think 
that the Latinx Community has 
raised some important issues. 
That is one of the things really 
I admire about our students 
here that they will see a concern 
and raise the issue, and what I 
love about the administration 
is that we are responsive. So we 
are engaged in that discussion 
dialogue process right now to 
better understand and then to 
figure out given what the needs 
are what it is that we are able to 
do.”

While progress is beginning 

in areas of dining and outreach, 
LSA 
sophomore 
Alexander 

Mullen, 
internal 
director 

of 
La 
Casa, 
expressed 
his 

concern about meetings with 
administration 
being 
rooted 

more in conversation than in 
creating actionable change.

“They definitely want to do 

something, 
but 
when 
we’re 

actually meeting with these 
offices and people who we are 
meeting with, we don’t see a lot of 
actual action items on the table,” 
Mullen said. “It seems like they 
want to just talk about the way 
we feel and why this came about, 
so it doesn’t seem like it’s a really 
productive 
meeting 
entirely, 

but it seems more like framing 
future conversations.”

Mullen also touched on the 

lack of urgency he felt coming 
from 
the 
administration’s 

alleged efforts to meet La Casa’s 
demands.

“From 
the 
meetings 
and 

the tone of the meetings we 
don’t really get that there’s a 
big sense of urgency to meet 
these demands and have them 
worked on at all, especially with 
the end of the year coming to a 
close,” Mullen said. “I think one 
strategy a lot of people seem to 
be using is just kind of waiting 
it out until the year is over and 
then moving on to the next thing 
for the next year.”

Another challenge La Casa 

faced while dealing with the 
administration is updating new 
staff from different departments 
on reasons behind creating a list 
of demands. In this past year 
alone, members of the Latinx 
community have faced racial 
bias through the defacement 
of the Rock with anti-Latinx 
statements and led a boycott 
against Multi-Ethnic Student 
Affairs for a lack of Latinx 
representation.

Mullen said the frustrations 

of having to explain the events of 
the past year slows the process 
of 
establishing 
measurable 

change.

“One thing we’ve had happen 

is that new staff have been 
hired in a few offices so they’re 
meeting with us coming in with 

only a few months of experience 
working with that department 
or office,” Mullen said. “So it’s 
just kind of like framing the 
whole story, trying to get them to 
understand the events that have 
happened earlier in the year that 
set the tone for the demands and 
set the need for them.”

Representation is one of the 

main areas Sandoval and Mullen 
cite as not being acknowledged 
by the administration. La Casa 
feels that the staff, faculty 
and 
administrators 
do 
not 

adequately reflect the student 
body.

Mullen 
explained 
some 

of 
the 
pushbacks 
against 

adequate representation comes 
from 
Proposal 
2, 
a 
ballot 

initiative aimed at stopping 
discrimination based on race, 
color, sex or religion in admission 
to colleges, jobs and other 
publicly-funded institutions — 
outlawing 
affirmative 
action 

at public institutions. He said 
meetings with Sellers and other 
diversity-focused faculty have 
been more effective in starting 
a push for more representation 
but still drag compared to other 
initiatives like the bus tours 
program.

“A lot of obstacles come up 

with Proposal 2, but we’ve been 
meeting with people like Robert 
Sellers who can help to affect 
change in those kinds of hiring 
practices 
through 
strategic 

hiring practices,” Mullen said. 
“We’ve been meeting with him 
and other people who are in 
charge of those kinds of issues.”

Sandoval 
shared 
Mullen’s 

sentiment about the trickiness 
of 
gaining 
more 
Latinx 

representation in administrative 
positions. She also discussed 
how the advisory board, which 
was proposed in the list of 
demands as a method to connect 
Latinx students to University 
President Mark Schlissel, could 
help the University with this 
issue.

“That’s always been a touchy, 

tricky 
topic, 
but 
we 
have 

been talking about that and 
one specific proposal was the 
advisory board and I feel like 
that’s just one mechanism for 
how students, staff, graduate 
students who are Latinx can 
give feedback directly to the 
president in order to create 
concrete change,” Sandoval said. 
“Right now, that’s the one that 
has been the trickiest, and the 
one that has been lacking the 
most.”

Moving 
forward, 
Mullen 

hopes to see more urgency from 
the University in implementing 
La Casa’s demands. He also 
expressed the importance of not 
allowing the desire for change 
to disappear moving into the 
upcoming school year.

“I’d definitely like to see more 

of a sense of urgency,” Mullen 
said. “I feel like especially, as I 
mentioned before, with the end 
of the year coming up, I think 
everyone is kind of winding 
down … That burnout is kind of 
dangerous to a movement like 
this because it lets you think it’s 
not important right now and we 
can just leave it for next year. 
If we just leave it for next year 
that same energy and that same 
momentum isn’t going to be 
there.”

Sandoval echoed Mullen’s call 

for establishing concrete change 
and emphasized the need to 
build a campus environment that 
allows future Latinx students to 
feel more included.

“Our point is to really make 

sure that there is sustainable 
change,” Sandoval said. “It’s 
great that we are having these 
meetings, but once I graduate 
and once the other directors 
graduate, how do we make sure 
incoming freshman are able to 
benefit from these discussions? 
How can we ensure these 
offices cater to their needs? 
That they have a good dining 
hall experience, that they have 
a good housing experience, that 
they really feel they belong. 
These are the goals we are 
striving towards.”

Black economic empowerment,’” 
Naidoo said. “‘That’s actually 
Black South enrichment that 
only I am going to benefit from.’” 

Naidoo 
also 
suggested 

global security needed creative 
maladjustment, in reference to 
nuclear weapons and ongoing 
commentary 
from 
President 

Donald Trump on the state 
of 
nuclear 
security. 
Naidoo 

pointed out several countries 
view Trump and North Korean 
leader Kim Jong-un similarly, 
and believe the U.S. does not 
necessarily have the right to 
dictate which countries can 
handle nuclear weapons.

“Why is it that the one country 

in the world that has nuclear 
weapons, 
that 
has 
dropped 

nuclear weapons, that has not 
tried to say anything about 
reducing nuclear weapons, what 
moral basis do they have to say to 
any other country in the world, 
‘Thou shall not have nuclear 
weapons?’” Naidoo said.

He continued to discuss the 

convergence of climate change, 
inequality 
and 
“affluenza.” 

Naidoo defined “affluenza” as a 
condition of believing happiness 
can only be achieved through 
material 
goods 
and 
Naidoo 

believes it is the biggest disease 
plaguing people today. Naidoo 
stressed the need for the U.S. to 
address how it uses its power to 
push for global justice, especially 
as other countries’ perceptions of 
the U.S. have dropped since the 
election of Trump.

“I have to say that it’s quite 

shocking, especially to people 
who come from struggles against 
racism and bigotry and so on, to 
see a political leadership that 
tolerates 
white 
supremacists 

and 
Nazism,” 
Naidoo 
said. 

“And simply sees it as differing 
opinions from others. Today, 
many people in the world are 
saying, ‘We can’t wait for the U.S. 
anymore.’”

Naidoo then discussed climate 

change and the disastrous effects 
it is already having in Africa 
through 
damaged 
resources 

and the ability to make food. He 
acknowledged 
the 
reluctance 

of 
many 
people, 
including 

environmental 
activists, 
to 

address the catastrophic effects 
on humans.

“It’s 
very 
important 
to 

recognize that the climate crisis 
is much deeper than many of 
us are willing to acknowledge,” 
Naidoo 
said. 
“Including, 

surprisingly, 
people 
in 
the 

environmental movement.”

Stressing the importance of 

recognizing the climate change 
crisis, and the necessity for 
policy change before effects 
would become too disastrous for 
humans, Naidoo said the human 
race must recognize the grave 
consequences of damaging the 
planet beyond repair.

“We don’t have a plan B 

because we don’t have a planet 
B,” Naidoo said. “We have one 
planet and we have to learn to 
live on it as a human family.”

Naidoo ended his talk by 

asking the audience to assess 
their role in global justice and 
change. He stressed the need for 
students to use their education to 
push for change.

“It’s an amazing thing to have 

the power to understand and 
analyze the world that education 
has given you the opportunity 
for,” Naidoo said. “And I think 
you all have a moral obligation to 
use that education for a general 
public purpose.”

The talk was followed by a 

question and answer session, 
where Public Policy graduate 
student and sophomore Larry 
Sanders 
and 
Nadine 
Jawad 

respectively 
read 
anonymous 

questions from the audience.

After the event, Rackham 

student Eitan Paul emphasized 
Naidoo’s discussion on coalitions 
and how to push for change 
today.

“I thought it was a very 

inspiring address highlighting 
a lot of really important global 
issues,” Paul said. “And offering 
ways to think about how we 
can work together and form 
coalitions to address the huge 
challenges of today.”

Business 
senior 
Chelsea 

Racelis spoke on how Naidoo’s 
discussion may influence the way 
she changes her own methods of 
activism.

“Naidoo definitely changed 

the 
way 
I 
frame 
climate 

change 
and 
human 
rights,” 

Racelis said. “The fact that 
he has been appointed as the 
secretary general of Amnesty 
International 
as 
a 
climate 

activist, 
largely, 
is 
super 

compelling. I think it’s going 
to change how I do my human 
rights advocacy, for sure.”

What does it mean to support free speech?

ANNA HORTON | OP-ED

T

he slang use of the word 
“basic” emerged during my 
high 
school 

years and was marked 
by the appreciation of 
Starbucks, UGG boots 
and yoga pants. These 
three 
preferences 

were enough to make 
someone 
“basic.” 

According 
to 
an 

article by Buzzfeed, 
basic came into usage 
around 2011. However, 
according to the piece 
“that original usage had nothing to 
do with middle-class white girls. 
Instead, ‘basic bitch,’ like so many 
things that become commonplace 
within mainstream (white) culture, 
was 
appropriated 
from 
black 

culture.”

By 2014, the term basic as it 

is now understood was widely 
recognizable. 
CollegeHumor 

shared a video titled, “How To 
Tell If You’re a Basic Bitch.” This 
is where the slang version of basic 
derived from: the designation 
of a woman as a basic bitch. 
However, as the Buzzfeed article 
points out, “basic bitch” was the 
slang primarily used by the Black 
community. “Basic bitch” also had 
different connotations before it was 
co-opted by white culture when it 
was also shortened to basic.

Basic, in its mainstream slang 

form, is used to indicate a woman 
(almost always white in this 
iteration of the word) who likes 
things that are popular. The sin of 
a basic is consuming what other 
white women consume. The basic 
woman’s habits are boring. Of 
course, she likes the popular thing. 
She likes it because it’s popular.

The wrongdoing of someone 

who is basic goes beyond that. The 
basic woman is wrong because her 
personality is hinged on her taste. 
Her taste is unoriginal. Therefore 
her whole being is unoriginal. 
Therefore she is basic. Because 
the regular thing to do is decide 
that someone’s whole essence is 
encapsulated by their pumpkin 
spice 
latte 
order 
and 
thusly 

condemn them. Basic is, or was at 
one point, strictly negative.

Since then, basic has grown 

and changed. Now, partaking in 
any number of activities can make 
a person basic. Basic activities 

include (but are not limited to) 
buying scented candles, wearing 

Timberland shoes and 
ordering white wine. 
My most distinct basic 
characteristics are as 
follows: I like brunch, 
Warby Parker glasses 
and 
the 
musical, 

“Hamilton.” 
I 
can’t 

even track what’s basic 
anymore. As far as I 
can tell, you’re basic 
for liking anything that 
people like.

I do think that basic has lost 

some of the power it once had. I 
think we’ve collectively leaned 
into it. While it may still tend to be 
negative at times, women use basic 
familiarly now, with affection. And 
while it was never a particularly 
impressive or barbed insult, it has 
found an even more casual place in 
the vernacular and serves just to call 
white girls out for doing anything 
that at least one other white girl 
might like doing. It has even turned 
to a term that can be used for 
men, though basic dudes are more 
commonly known as “bros,” as can 
be seen in a CollegeHumor video 
published the year after the basic 
bitch video came out.

Even though basic isn’t the 

insult it used to be, I think it’s 
interesting that it existed at all. 
If we deconstruct the motivation 
behind calling someone basic, it 
might shed interesting light on the 
expectations we have for women.

When women call other women 

basic in a judgmental way, we play 
into a patriarchal assumption that 
women have to prove their power 
by belittling other women. In 
media, we frequently see women 
in competition. Female characters 
are “frenemies” or straight up 
challengers after the same man. 
The purpose of female friendships 
as they are often represented 
is to exhibit rivalry — to 
demonstrate that women are too 
dramatic/petty/emotional (take 
your pick of adjectives) to simply 
be friends with another woman 
or a group of women.

Think 
about 
how 
it’s 

supposedly a compliment to tell a 
girl that she’s “not like other girls.” 
That she’s better because she has 
differentiated herself from other 
women; other women typically 

possess some shared, negative trait 
but this one woman does not have 
it. Using the designation of basic 
convinced women to do this for 
themselves, to boost their position 
in the hierarchy by demeaning 
the tastes of a different group. 
Noreen Malone, in an article for 
The Cut, writes that basic, as an 
insult “derives its power from 
the knowledge that if you can 
recognize someone or something 
as basic, you probably, yourself, 
aren’t it.”

Basic also depends on the 

oft-internalized idea that women 
exist to be seen. It relies on the 
assumption that women’s tastes 
are 
performative. 
Basic 
only 

works because we expect that the 
whole motivation behind women’s 
preferences is to tell others (like 
men) something about her, that 
everything she does has the express 
purpose of making people think 
she fits into some specific group. 
But when she picks the wrong 
things, or wants people to feel a 
specific, 
arbitrarily-determined 

wrong way about her, we deem her 
basic. Women are not allowed to 
just like things. Every single thing 
they choose to consume is picked 
with the purpose of crafting 
a persona. Essentially, calling 
someone basic assumes that what 
a woman prefers — from clothing 
to coffee order — was chosen for 
the purpose of telling you who 
she is, and that your judgment is 
something that matters to her. It 
probably doesn’t.

As writer Dana Schwartz 

once tweeted, “Let’s stop calling 
girls basic for liking things that 
are objectively likable...” Insults, 
especially gendered ones, lose their 
power when women refuse to bow 
to the pressure of undermining 
other women to secure their own 
status. 

With all of that being said, basic 

has already started its descent into 
so-last-year insults. It was weak at 
best, and as the sheer inanity of it 
becomes apparent, it just grows 
weaker. It loses its power if you 
lean into it, if you reclaim it, if you 
decide that being basic just means 
that you like things that are likable. 
Good for you.

A 

recently-published Vox 
article claims a radical 
counter-narrative 
to 

one of the most contentious 
subjects on college campuses 
across the U.S. According to 
the news outlet’s co-founder, 
Matthew Yglesias, “support 
for free speech” is actually 
on the rise among liberal 
college students.

In 
his 
article, 
Yglesias 

calls out reporters at The New 
York Times and Reason for 
“bombastically” 
exaggerating 

university 
“politically 

correct” culture. The recent 
protest 
of 
Christina 
Hoff 

Sommers’s lecture at Lewis 
& Clark College, along with 
the controversy over NYT’s 
Bari 
Weiss’s 
op-ed 
“We’re 

All Fascists Now,” aren’t only 
unrepresentative of free speech 
decline — they’re distracting 
from larger trends. In fact, 
according to nearly five decades 
of questionnaires by the U.S. 
General 
Social 
Survey, 
the 

US is increasingly supportive 
of 
communist, 
militarist, 

anti-theist 
and 
homosexual 

speakers. This acceptance of 
“controversial” 
viewpoints, 

Yglesias argues, suggests free 
speech is less of a contentious 
issue than conservatives would 
have us believe.

Yet several problems prevail 

with 
Yglesias’s 
argument, 

the most obvious being the 
categories themselves. After 
all, when was the last time you 
went to hear a “communist” or 
“militarist” speak, whether on 
campus or otherwise? What 
about an “anti-theist?” Not 
only are these labels outdated, 
but 
equating 
the 
social 

environment of 1972 (when 
the study began) with today 
ignores the dramatic historical 
changes that have normalized 
such views (the fall of the Soviet 
Union, for one). What’s more, 
the Foundation for Individual 
Rights in Education has logged 
371 speakers as “disinvited” 
from 
public, 
private, 
and 

religious universities between 
2000 and 2018, the majority 
of whom were identified as 
“conservative.” 

Yet another inconsistency 

in Yglesias’s argument lies in 
the assumption that supporting 
the 
expression 
of 
certain 

ideological paradigms is the 
same as supporting free speech. 
Imagine 
you 
were 
asked 

whether you’d be willing to 
listen to a well-known feminist 
speaker. Then imagine that 
someone asked you whether 
you’d be willing to listen to 
someone dispute the gender pay 
gap. Do you see the problem? 
The reason self-dubbed “factual 
feminist” 
Christina 
Hoff 

Sommers is controversial isn’t 
her label, but her unwillingness 
to toe an ideological line. 
As she argues in a video for 
Prager University, “(feminist) 
activists make claims … to 
support their views” that don’t 
stand up to scrutiny. Yet rather 
than subjecting her and other 
“controversial” 
speakers 
to 

similar 
treatment, 
students 

reject their ideas as acceptable 
or 
unacceptable, 
good 
or 

bad. 
Rather 
than 
objective 

information, facts have become 
political territories waiting to 
be staked by whichever party 
they are interpreted to support.

It’s easy to let the partisan 

brain take over at this point. 
After all, aren’t certain groups 
just twisting facts to support 
their 
political 
agendas? 

Christina 
Hoff 
Sommers, 

as one Salon article puts it, 
is nothing but a “bigot who 
makes a living propping up 
misogynist myths.” What’s the 
point of having such a speaker 
on campus anyway?

In yet another Vox article, 

ironically titled “Science is 
already political. So scientists 
might as well march.” David 
Roberts argues that science 
is made up of two aspects: 
scientific theory (“science-t”) 
and 
scientific 
practice 

(“science-p”). Science-t is pre-

interpretive fact — the raw 
data produced by replicable 
research. Roberts notes that 
since science informs rather 
than proves, it must rely on 
consistency before it can be 
considered a fact. Science-p, 
however, is science taken to 
its logical end in supporting, 
not supporting or complicating 
a hypothesis. Thus, while we 
need science-t to determine 
trends, we need science-p to 
decide what that those trends 
mean — a process Roberts 
labels as inherently political.

Humans 
need 

interpretation — it’s how we 
make sense of being bombarded 
daily with data. But we also 
need to constantly check our 
interpretations for bias. As 
Peter Boghossian, a philosophy 
professor at Portland State 
University, notes, “obfuscation 
is a litmus test of an ideologue.” 
If we, as college students, 
truly want to support free 
speech, our allegiance must 
lie with facts, not ideologies, 
and reasoned belief rather 
than 
acceptable 
dogma. 

Likewise, if we truly hold to 
certain 
political 
opinions, 

welcoming alternative views 
should be part of maintaining 
our credibility.

Regardless of whether you 

find someone like Christina 
Hoff Sommers convincing, at 
least consider this: Her message 
begs a counter-narrative, not a 
walkout. Judging people on a 
categorical basis ignores the 
nuance of individual belief, and 
listening to speakers who’ve 
refused to align with neat 
politically-correct paradigms 
may be about challenging our 
views, not bashing theirs. If 
we can agree that the only 
message poisoned by facts is a 
poisonous message, we should 
also agree on this: Current 
trends in campus free speech 
are hardly antidotal.

O

n Sunday night, a woman 
riding a bicycle in Tempe, 
Ariz., was killed by a 

self-driving Uber SUV in what has 
been reported as the 
first 
death 
caused 

by 
autonomous 

technology 
in 
the 

United States.

It is fair to say 

that we are entering an 
era of unprecedented 
technological progress 
and 
productivity 
— 

over the past 40 years, 
we have witnessed 
exponential growth 
in areas like computing efficiency, 
computer 
memory 
and 
non-

commercial flight distance.

But this technological boom 

has not come without its fair share 
of problems, and the recent Uber-
related death may just represent the 
tip of the iceberg as it relates to the 
dangers of autonomous technologies 
becoming increasingly public. If 
anything, this should serve as a 
warning to our computer-crazed 
society that we should take a step 
back and see if the upward trend of 
technological progress is really the 
safest direction to be traveling in.

Earlier this month, I attended 

a talk in Chicago by Thomas 
Friedman, a columnist for The New 
York Times. Friedman, who writes 
as the newspaper’s foreign affairs 
columnist, was speaking about 
his newest book, “Thank You For 
Being Late: An Optimist’s Guide to 
Thriving in the Age of Acceleration.”

Friedman’s book describes the 

ways in which the current era of 
technological revolution is reshaping 
various elements of our society, 
ranging from the climate to politics 
to the workplace. The name of the 
book came from a personal anecdote: 
One time, when a colleague ran 

15 minutes late to a meeting and 
frantically apologized upon arrival, 
Friedman responded by thanking 
him for being late. The extra 15 

minutes 
had 
allowed 

Friedman to collect his 
thoughts on a topic that 
was escaping him.

His book boiled down 

to the idea that technology 
is increasing at a rate 
humans cannot keep up 
with, and in the process 
of trying to keep up, 
we often forget to slow 
down — even when it 
might be beneficial.

The events that transpired Sunday 

in Tempe present an additional piece 
of evidence that both supports and 
complicates Friedman’s narrative.

Insofar 
as 
Friedman 
talks 

about the dangers of technology 
— the exponential increase in 
global warming and the straining 
of geopolitical tensions due to 
globalization — the death of the 
Tempe woman fits in this narrative.

And while this was the first death 

caused by autonomous technology, it 
is not the first time a similar incident 
has occurred. In 2016, the National 
Transportation 
Safety 
Board 

partially faulted Tesla for a deadly 
crash involving its autopilot system 
in Florida, and earlier this year a self-
driving Uber car ran a red light in 
California, prompting the removal 
of all such cars by the California 
Department of Motor Vehicles.

Similarly, in the wake of this 

recent tragedy, Uber announced 
that they would halt the testing of all 
autonomous vehicles in the United 
States and Canada.

In his book, Friedman attests 

to the exponential development 
of 
technologies 
over 
time, 

demonstrated by Moore’s Law, a 1965 
theory created by Intel Co-Founder 

George Moore that argues for 
the doubling of computer power 
every two years at the same cost. 
However, the shutdown of Uber’s 
self-driving car program represents a 
technology giant slowing down their 
own trajectory for fear of negative 
consequences — a clear departure 
from Friedman’s narrative.

This is all to say that while 

Friedman gives us guidance on how 
to keep up with technology, we may 
be better off staying in place.

Friedman’s end goal is to prove 

that there are ways for humans to 
catch up to the rate of technological 
progress, such as inventing new 
algorithms that make educating and 
governing more widely applicable 
and efficient. He claims that when 
humans do catch up, it will make 
technology all the more powerful and 
helpful for countries across the world.

While the benefits of this type of 

growth are high, the risks are even 
higher. As firms continue to compete 
for the fastest computing power, 
replacing humans day by day, it 
comes at a cost that may even equate 
to a human life.

So what does this mean for the 

average college student?

It 
means 
confronting 
the 

technology obsessions that resonate 
through each of our daily lives, 
from food delivery applications to 
cash transfer services. It means 
taking a moment, or two, to slow 
down and realize that the dangers 
of technology may not be present 
immediately, but have wide-ranging, 
tangible consequences.

It might even mean taking 

your foot off the gas when you’re 
running late to a meeting or lecture 
— trust me, your classmates won’t 
go anywhere.

Demystifying peer review

PEGGY RANDON | OP-ED

T

he idea of peer tutoring 
has always seemed to be 
a misnomer. In order for 

someone to tutor, certainly his or her 
abilities in the subject surpass the 
abilities of the person being taught. 
For writing — even in the humanities 
and social sciences — I generally 
understood knowledge to be black 
or white. Therefore, the cultivation 
of these skills could only come from 
a very controlled source.

Looking back, it makes sense 

that my transition to college was 
more difficult with this mindset. The 
standards of writing that I had grown 
up with were now completely turned 
around. In high school, though the 
abstract tool of peer review was highly 
marketed to students, the idea only 
might have extended to a quick check-
in of page length and grammar and 
perhaps the remodeling of a sentence 
or two. In college, help is primarily 
given by tutoring programs staffed 
with undergraduate and graduate 
students. The expectation is that 
knowledge is generated between 
knowledgeable 
students 
and 

that truth is as actively created 
as it is shared.

Nevertheless, 
whenever 
I 

extended my learning beyond the 
classroom, it was always away from 
student critique and toward office 
hours and professors. Admittedly, 
I rarely learned much more than 
I did in the classroom. As much 
as the professors would try to 
relate to and inspire me, nothing 
clicked. Of course, this is not the 
same for everyone. Many students 
are enriched by individual time 
with teachers. Still, a vast majority 
can sympathize with a student 
that experiences a devastatingly 

unhelpful session of office hours. 
Personally, the belief was always that 
people are only as good off paper as 
they are on paper. Maybe, instead, I 
should have switched the order.

Collaborative work — specifically, 

verbalizing ideas with like-minded 
individuals in a form of peer 
review — can be very beneficial to 
improve one’s writing. Recently, 
more research has been conducted 
assessing trends in open dialogue 
between peers with an increase in 
students’ overall problem-solving 
skills at the post-secondary level. 
In fact, 2017 research by Chad Loes 
and Ernest Pascarella asserts that 
the act of engaging with others on 
academic work improves “openness 
to diversity … a greater ability to 
transfer 
information 
from 
one 

setting to another … and the ability to 
generate new ideas and solutions,” all 
of which can be applied to and used 
to benefit writing.

Essentially, where traditional 

learning 
practices 
(relying 
on 

office hours and professors) may 
be unsuccessful, students should 
consider 
complimenting 
those 

efforts with peer review. In both 
roles, tutor and student, the learning 
is as plentiful as the conversation 
is constant. Instead of thinking of 
it as encouraging confusion, “peer 
tutoring” can be more accurately 
understood as the pooling of 
information, ideas and experiences to 
enable deeper, reorganized thought 
and increased understanding.

Not to mention, the environment 

of peer review often breeds friendly, 
non-hostile 
conversation, 
which 

could be helpful to those who might 
feel anxious talking with their 
professors. In fact, the process of 

sharing ideas is most successful 
when it is between students, because 
the insecurities and drawbacks of 
divulging your thoughts to an adult, 
much less the one allocating grades 
for your writing, are eliminated.

In short, many will form their 

own habits to study and get support, 
but few will turn to peer review as a 
sustainable option, not recognizing 
its core benefits to college learning. 
The wonderful thing about writing 
is that it is not necessarily about 
assigning a right and wrong; it is the 
provocation of thought that might 
critique what is right or wrong, and 
the continuous improvement of 
one’s abilities.

Evidently, great writing forms 

by a never-ending conversation with 
oneself, and foremost, with others 
in social settings. In fact, I might go 
as far as to agree with K.A. Bruffee 
that writing is “a social artifact,” if 
by that he means it demands to be 
reshaped and impacted by continued 
conversation and human interaction.

It might also relate to the 

idea that fully grasping a concept 
requires the ability to concisely 
explain it to others. As understood 
by Peter Smagorinsky, “the process 
of speaking itself often serves as a 
vehicle through which new thoughts 
emerge,” it allows people to organize 
ideas and build off of them. With 
that said, while I will continue to 
go to my teachers for guidance and 
use other resources for reference in 
writing, I will no longer devalue the 
insight potential share of knowledge 
achieved by simply talking with my 
peers.

Few operas have the name 
recognition that Mozart’s “The 
Marriage of Figaro” holds. This 
weekend, the School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance will present a 
modern interpretation of the great 
classic at the Lydia Mendelssohn 
Theatre. 
Directed 
by 
Grant 
Preisser, the opera will be sung 
in Italian with projected English 
supertitles. 
The 
University 
Philharmonic 
Orchestra, 
conducted by Martin Katz, will be 
performing alongside the singers.
“The Marriage of Figaro” is a 
romantic comedy — a rarity in a 
genre that is normally overflowing 
with tragedy. The story, based on 
the play by Pierre Beaumarchais, 
is set in Seville, Spain and follows 
the story of Figaro, a servant to 
the Count and Countess, and 
his fiancé Susanna. The Count, 
unhappy with his marriage to 
the Countess, is infatuated with 
Susanna. The Countess hears 
wind of this love affair and 
furiously vows to take revenge. 
Thus springs a complex plotline of 
trickery, cross-dressing and tests 
of loyalty. Think Shakespeare’s 
“Othello,” but with less ominous 
undertones.
Under Preisser’s direction, this 
centuries-old opera is much more 
adapted to modern times.
“He decided to put a big clash 
between women as sex objects 

and 
women 
as 
empowered 
figures,” said Zachary Crowle, 
a SMTD graduate student, of 
Preisser. Crowle plays the Count, 
a character that regularly sexually 
and 
verbally 
abuses 
women 
throughout the opera. Mozart 
creates a foil to this sexism in 
the character of Susanna, who 
is a refreshingly strong female 

character.
“She’s very smart, very funny 
and not afraid to speak her mind,” 
said Mahari Conston, another 
SMTD 
graduate 
student, 
of 
Susanna.
“The women are not only 
constantly standing up to those 
with power, but are working 
together to improve upon it,” 
said Kristine Overman, SMTD 
undergraduate. The beauty of 
“The Marriage of Figaro” is in 
these timeless parallels to modern 
times; the behaviour of Susanna 
and the Countess are reminiscent 
of the ongoing global #MeToo 

movement.
Preisser has also taken care to 
enhance Mozart’s emphasis on 
class struggle in the opera. Written 
just before the time of the French 
Revolution, “The Marriage of 
Figaro” was considered very 
controversial when it first came 
to theaters, so much so that a 
majority of theaters refused to 
air the opera. The socioeconomic 
clash between Figaro, a servant, 
and the Count, a member of the 
extravagant aristocrat class, is 
apparent to any viewer.
“It was really one of the first 
times in history that any kind 
of literature stood up to people 
in power,” Crowle said. We see 
this kind of opposition to power 
every day in the news, through 
marches and protests both in the 
University and around the world.
SMTD undergraduate Justin 
Burgess, 
who 
plays 
Figaro, 
commented 
that 
the 
visuals 
have been updated as well to fit 
with modern times; they aren’t 
the typical archaic style that is 
expected of operas.
“There’s a juxtaposition of 
old imagery mixed with bright, 
modern day technicolor,” Burgess 
said. “It really makes a cool visual 
for the audience.”
From relatable characters and 
relevant social issues, to modern 
sets and color schemes, SMTD’s 
rendition of “The Marriage of 
Figaro” aims to think outside the 
box and adapt to the changing 
interests of our current society.

What’s my relationship with 
Shonda Rhimes’s shows? Let’s 
just say it’s complicated.
My love affair started many 
years ago when my mom and 
I became hooked on the soap-
opera antics of “Grey’s Anatomy” 
— that is, before it digressed 
into a monotonous, millennial 
obsession. From there, I stopped 
visiting Shondaland for a while, 
because “Scandal” was deemed 
a little too, well, scandalous for 
my 12-year-old self. Yet, when I 
eventually got around to watching 
the suspense-filled series, I was 
left in awe of the bravado of Kerry 
Washington. Now even more 
recently, I have started binging 
“How to Get Away with Murder” 
and 
have 
become 
instantly 

infatuated with the mystery of it 
all, streaming it every chance I 
get.
Throughout the many good and 
not-so-good phases of Rhimes’s 
creations, her sign of involvement 
is undeniably recognizable. In a 
seemingly tired and repetitive 
fashion — or perhaps as a mark of 
sheer genius — her shows share 

the same tropes and themes 
across the board: a bold female 
lead, a group of attractive young 
professionals trying to prove their 
worth, dizzying love triangles, 
a lot of dead bodies and an epic 
soundtrack.

Let me be clear, though — 
Shonda Rhimes’s brand as one of 
the most powerful Black female 
producers is iconic, full stop. 
She’s gone on to build an empire 
by herself, with five shows airing 
or in development on ABC, a 
production deal with Netflix and 
fame emerging from four years 
of #TGIT watch parties. After 
all this time, it’s no secret that 
Rhimes has generated a television 
phenomenon, making nuanced 
characters and absurd subplots 
her showrunner staple.
But how much longer will the 
same old storyline be able to pack 
a punch? With “For the People,” 
Rhimes’s newest addition to the 
Shondaland family, it appears that 
her winning formula is beginning 
to lose its magic touch.
This time around, the latest 
ABC legal drama follows a crew 
of budding lawyers — three for 

Repetitiveness of Rhimes

the defense and three for the 
prosecution. As their personal 
and professional lives clash, they 
take on some of the most high-
profile cases in the U.S., while 
also probably sleeping around and 
forming a list of enemies.
Judging its merit by a mere 
60 minutes, “For the People” 
has nothing on the pilots of 
“Scandal” and “How to Get Away 
with Murder.” For starters, its 
core group of actors are largely 
unconvincing, save for Regé-Jean 
Page (“Roots”) as the resident 
trouble maker and prosecutor 
Leonard Knox. Even then, most 
of the leads are undiscovered 
talents with a bright-eyed, fresh-
faced quality to them that feels 
out of place on what should be a 
more gritty series. As defender 
Sandra Bell, the assumed female 
lead, Britt Robertson (“Girlboss”) 
does a satisfactory job of carrying 
the plot along, but lacks the 
gravitas 
necessary 
to 
even 

attempt to match Olivia Pope 
(Kerry Washington, “Scandal”) 
or Annalise Keating (Viola Davis, 
“How to Get Away with Murder”).
That’s not saying, though, 
that “For the People” should 
even be compared to prior 
Shondaland royalty. In fact, an 
area that the show differs from 
its predecessors is in its portrayal 
of the judicial system as a whole. 
The presentation of what court is 
like — the behind-the-scenes look 
at being a lawyer and the overall 
stresses of the job — are not only 
authenticized, but emphasized.
Instead of some mysterious 
murder 
or 
dramatic 
affair 
stealing the spotlight of the 
show, experiences that could 
conceivably happen in the real 
world float to the forefront. In 
the first episode, Sandra is tasked 
with defending a teenage Muslim-
American accused of planning to 
bomb the Statue of Liberty. OK, so 
maybe this example is a little far-

fetched, but Sandra’s emotionally-
backed defense of the innocent 
boy snaps us back to reality. On 
the flipside, an insider trading 
case pits lawyer couple Seth (Ben 
Rappaport, “Outsourced”) and 
Allison (Jasmin Savoy Brown, 
“The Leftovers”) against one 
another, 
literally. 
As 
Allison 
defends and Seth prosecutes, the 
pair constantly have to remind 
each other that their relationship 
can survive this — which is, of 
course, a tell-tale sign that it can’t.
It’s almost as if I can predict 
exactly what path “For the 
People” is likely to follow because 
its plot so far is extremely 
average. Maybe I was missing 
some of the Shonda Rhimes’s 
signature chaos and tragedy, or 
maybe the tropes are just getting 
out of touch. Either way, “For the 
People” and its fight for justice 
sparks an unimpressive sense of 
déjà vu and doesn’t add much to 
the Shondaland dynasty.

TV NOTEBOOK

TV has come a long way. 
Long gone are the days of the 
sickeningly 
uniform 
ubiquity 
of “fast-food TV,” those easily 
digestible 20 or 30-minute serials 
and soaps whose laugh tracks 
and cheap drama relegated TV 
into being the immature little 
brother of film. Fast forward 
20 odd years and, as hundreds 
of think pieces espouse, on a 
regular basis, we are in the 
“golden age” of TV. While film 
sometimes gives the impression 
of falling into an endless cycle 
of reboots and sequels, TV is 
filled with innovative, clever, 
dramatic, Shakespearean works 
of art. Even Meryl fucking 
Streep is on HBO. Helping kick-
start this revolution was a show, 
on a floundering network with 
unknown actors, called “Mad 
Men.”
Or so I’d been told. Despite 
being familiar with all the 
“modern classics” of “The Wire,” 
“The 
Sopranos,” 
“Breaking 
Bad,” etc., I’d hastily dismissed 
“Mad Men” as being style over 
substance. I was unable to look 
beyond the glamorous hair, suits 
and fancy cocktail orders to see 
what “Mad Men” truly is: one 
of the greatest set of character 
studies in modern TV.
“Mad Men” spans roughly a 
decade in the 1960s and 1970s, 
focusing on the offices of Sterling 
Cooper, a Madison Avenue firm 
at the height of the advertising 
craze. It centers on the life of 
Don Draper (Jon Hamm, “Baby 
Driver”), a talented creative 
director at Sterling Cooper with 
a ridiculous amount of self-
assured swagger and an equally 
mysterious past. The show uses 
the 
interactions 
of 
Sterling 
Cooper employees to explore 
and reflect upon the changing 
social norms of the turbulent 
’60s, drawing on topics from the 
counterculture movement to the 
Civil Rights Movement.
Period dramas had been done 
before and since, but few have 
the ability of “Mad Men” to 
fully engross in the world they 
portray. The attention to detail 
in every aspect of the show is 
stunning, but more importantly, 
the environments the character 
live in do not feel explicitly like 
sets. Rather, they are as dynamic 
and alive as the characters 
themselves.
While Don Draper’s story is 
the centerpiece of the show, it 

is the interactions of the large 
cast of characters that make 
the show a masterpiece. The 
arcs of Pete Campbell (Vincent 
Kartheiser, “The Most Hated 
Woman 
in 
America”) 
and 
Sterling Cooper senior partner 
Roger Sterling (John Slattery, 
“Captain America: Civil War”) 
are some of the show’s most 
impactful, and, if anything, carry 
more tenable lessons to draw 
from. Sal Romano’s (Bryan Batt, 
“Mississippi Murder”) arc is a 
poignant exploration of society’s 
view on homosexuality. Even the 
minor characters, of which there 
are hundreds, feel fleshed out 
and realistic.
In another sense, the true 
heroes of the show are the 
women. Peggy Olsen (Elizabeth 
Moss, “The Handmaid’s Tale”) 
and 
Joan 
Harris 
(Christina 
Hendricks, “Zoolander 2”), the 
show’s two prominent female 
characters manage to rise above 
the traditional social structures 
imposed in a workplace such as 
the Sterling Cooper agency to 
gain greater standing. Peggy’s 
arc in particular is stunning 
to witness, especially after her 
introduction as a seemingly 
naïve, typical secretary school 
graduate in the pilot.
Another remarkable aspect 
of the show is that looking back, 
it never relied on traditional 
crowd-pleasers 
such 
as 
shoehorned romantic plots or 
violence. The relationships are 
(frustratingly) real and complex. 
All the drama and intrigue is due 
to social interactions between 
relatively uninteresting subjects: 
Corporate 
executives. 
In 
retrospect, my initial assumption 
of the show prioritizing style 
over substance was not just 
incorrect, it was the exact 
opposite of the true situation. 
While 
the 
flamboyant 
hair 
and glamorous, three-martini 
lunches 
were 
irresistible 
to 
watch, they weren’t for show, but 
rather for realism. The skilled 
writing and production elevate 
the show from simply being 
another “Pan Am.”
Each arc of each character 
in “Mad Men” is dynamic and 
compelling. 
The 
show 
does 
not fall prey to flanderization 
and creates a cast of three-
dimensional 
characters, 
each 
with his or her own set of 
strengths 
and 
insecurities. 
Ultimately, these attributes, in 
addition to the authenticity of 
the time period it portrays, make 
“Mad Men” one of the greatest 
TV shows of all time.

“Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” 
season 1, episode 1
The one that started it all. 
Pilots are hard, and rightfully so. 
More often than not, I’ve usually 
had to give a show the benefit of 
the doubt and keep on watching 
despite a lackluster pilot. “Mad 
Men,” 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
offers a perfect distillation and 
introduction to its rich, complex 
world. The first time we are 
introduced to Don Draper, he’s 
trying to figure out how to market 
cigarettes 
despite 
growing 
awareness of their health risks. 
Peggy is only the bumbling, 
shy secretary who hasn’t quite 
learned how to navigate the 
workplace. Pete Campbell is 
the most dislikable, nakedly 
ambitious prick one could be. 
Looking back after finishing 
the series, it’s a testament to 
the quality of the writing that 
while some of the characters 
feel like completely different 
people at the conclusion, their 
transformations 
are 
entirely 
believable if you look closer at 
the pilot.
“The Other Woman,” season 
5, episode 11
The Sterling Cooper team 
is working around the clock to 
secure the Jaguar account. At 
the same time, Joan wrestles 
with an extremely humiliating 
proposal. Hendricks is stunning 
in this episode, portraying a 
subtle, complex reaction that 
isn’t something we’d quite expect 
from her. The episode conjures 
a variety of ethical questions 
regarding business in general, 
and the juxtaposition of Joan’s 
decision and the handling of the 
Jaguar deal as a whole is one of 
the series’ most compelling.
“Lost Horizon,” season 7, 
episode 12
This episode features one of 
my favorite television scenes 
ever, as Peggy struts down the 
halls of McCann Erickson with 
sunglasses, a cigarette hanging 
out of her mouth and a copy of 
“The Dream of the Fisherman’s 
Wife,” all with the most satisfying 
smirk ever seen on television. 
Prior to this triumphant arrival, 
her interactions with Roger are 
heartwarming. Joan’s mixture 
of hope and disappointment 
are 
especially 
poignant. 
While Don’s journey is not 
quite as interesting, it offers 
a decent amount of character 
development. It also tiptoes the 
line of absurd humor and serious 
social commentary extremely 
well, as “Mad Men” often does so 
successfully.

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t 
nervous. I called my friend from 
home on my way to The Ark for 
encouragement and to pass the 
time. I told him of the current 
situation: I was walking to meet 
up with a stranger to attend a 
benefit indie-folk concert. He 
laughed at the fact that I was 
nervous in the first place, and he 
told me all would be fine as long as 
I was myself. I neared Main Street 
and had to say goodbye to my 
friend’s supportive words in order 
to begin my unexpected evening.
The headliner for the night 
was Ben Balmer, a indie folk-rock 
singer who’s traveled the world, 
and his band, who returned to 
Balmer’s Ann Arbor roots for the 
benefit concert “A Time to Plant.” 
Proceeds were donated to the 
scholarship fund for Dawn Farm, 
a unique local farm that offers 
different services of “long-term 
treatment to men and women who 
suffer from addictions,” as stated 
in the show’s program. Along with 
Balmer and his band, the show 
featured a plethora of other artists 
from across the country, like Peter 
Madcat Ruth, Jaimee Harris and 
Heidi Burson. Highlights from 
the night included Chris Buhalis, 
a singer/songwriter from Detroit, 
and Abigail Stauffer, a folk singer 
and a “special Dawn Farm pal.”
Although I was given little 
information about the stranger 
for the night, I was at least given 
his name. I decided not to look 
Robby up prior to the visit, adding 
to the mystery and leaving out the 

expectations. I was worried what 
he would think of coming all the 
way downtown to see a concert 
with a random person who would 
be writing an article about it. 
What if we didn’t like the music? 
What if he didn’t like me? Or 
worse, what if we just didn’t like 
each other?
But Robby, a sophomore in the 
School of Engineering, a person 
with a welcoming, warm smile 
that wiped away my unnecessary 
worries, arrived at The Ark with 
an open mind and a positive 
attitude. Phew. The awkward part 
was over.
Robby and I took our seats 
in the back while the rest of the 
audience filled up the tight space 
of the venue. I looked at him and 
then observed the scene: Among 
the grey-haired crowd, we were 
most likely the youngest people 
there. Arriving 10 minutes before 
the show began, we were lucky to 
have a friendly conversation about 
our (surprisingly many) common 
interests of music, hiking and 
similar travel destinations.
Ben Balmer and his band took 
to the stage and opened with 
“a song that everybody knows” 
— a lovely rendition of “Happy 
Birthday” for the development 
director, Olivia Vigiletti. The 
band consisted of eccentric and 
individualistic characters: Ben 
Balmer on guitar and vocals, Josh 
Flowers on bass, Eddie Dickerson 
on violin and Aaron Parks on 
drums. Their differing talents 
but collective vibe absorbed the 
audience’s attention.
The Texas band’s hair-raising 
harmonies matched their intimate 
lyrics about life on the road, lovely 

details of a lady and the emotional 
challenges of addiction. The other 
artists 
throughout 
the 
night 
made their way on and off the 
stage, performing solo songs and 
accompaniments with Balmer’s 
band. While music filled my ears, 
thoughts continued to travel 
through my mind. Thoughts of 
worry and curiosity lingered 
from the initial nervousness, 
distracting me at times from the 
performance. I was hoping I didn’t 
smell bad and that he was having 
fun and that our connection 
wasn’t artificial. But, as if I was 
at any other performance, I tried 
to let the evening take me by the 
hand, unannounced and leaving 
me on the edge of my seat.
Plucking, playing, bouncing 
and smiling, Dickerson’s intense 
liveliness enthused Robby and 
me. Giggling back and forth 
throughout the night, joking 
about the violinist’s wild and 
unfathomable 
energy 
and 
commenting on the impressive 
talent of all the artists, Robby 
became less of a stranger as the 
night progressed.
I went home that night and 
played Ben Balmer from my back 
pocket as I brushed my teeth. I 
questioned what the night would 
have been like if I had gone to 
The Ark alone or if my guest was 
someone other than Robby. I 
wondered if I’d ever see a concert 
with Robby again, or if I’d ever 
see him again, period. Regardless, 
it’s nights like this one where 
I was thankful to have a sweet 
guest with me — one who saw the 
importance of two people being 
entertained for the sake of art, for 
the sake of a human connection.

BACKSTAGE PASS

Reading ‘A Tree Grows in 
Brooklyn’ by Betty Smith

I can’t tell you how many 
times I’ve frantically searched 
my house for my paperback copy 
of “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.” I 
had emphatically recommended 
it to a friend. My mother said she 
would loan it to her colleague. I 
needed it for a high school book 
report. Every time I found it in 
the same place: under a stack of 
books on my kitchen island, right 
in the center of the house.
Somewhere between the time 
when I first read the book five 
years ago and now, that spot on 
the kitchen island became the 
permanent spot for the novel. It’s 
as if I can’t bear to let it out of my 
sight every time I reread it, or as 
if the book can’t tear itself away 
from the countertop. It’s always 
in the center of everything, out of 
sight and out of mind, co-existing 
until someone from the periphery 
has the sudden urge to pick it back 
up again.
I first read “A Tree Grows in 
Brooklyn” when I was in middle 
school, a time that I still identify 
as one of the nastiest stages in 
adolescence. I, like most other 
middle-schoolers, was struggling 
to keep up with the norms of 
the rest of my class and spent 
most of the day gossiping with 
my friends. Being cool was the 
only important thing, and if you 
weren’t cool, what were you, 
really? It was a time of transition, 
vulnerability and confusion.
A worn copy of “A Tree Grows 
in Brooklyn” ended up in my 
hands one muggy summer day. 
The cover shows a young girl 
wearing a blue dress and blue 
headband, sitting precariously 
on a window ledge and reading 

a book balanced on her lap. Her 
short brown hair is pushed away 
from her face and the bold paint 
strokes of a tree trunk are visible 
behind her. Looking at the cover, I 
could identify with her. She didn’t 

seem to fit in, but she seemed 
happy being by herself with a 
book in her hands. A bookworm 
myself, I was curious enough to 
open the novel.
What struck me first, and 
angered 
me 
later, 
was 
the 
spontaneity of the characters. 
Francie, 
daughter 
of 
Irish 
immigrants living in the slums 
of Brooklyn in the early 1900s, 
possessed the broken nature 
of a child who’s been taught 
everything 
the 
wrong 
way. 
Francie learned patience from 
her father Johnny, an alcoholic 
who 
wouldn’t 
return 
home 
most nights, but would shower 
his children with love and gifts 
whenever he did. She learned 
responsibility 
from 
years 
of 
taking care of her younger brother 
Neely when her mother Katie was 
trying to scrape together a living, 
and years later when taking care 
of an unexpected addition to the 

family. Selling metal collected on 
the streets as a young girl made 
her cautious and wary.
It’s hard to relate to this cast 
of unlikely characters as a girl 
from a middle class suburb of 
Detroit. In my mind, Johnny 
was a terrible father, putting 
up a façade of loving his family 
while stealing their hard-earned 
pennies for drinks at the pub. 
When he said things like, “I am 
not a happy man ... I never wanted 
a family,” to Francie, my heart 
hurt. Francie was a heroine, but 
she was so advanced for her age 
that I couldn’t see myself in her 
shoes.
Rereading the book years later, 
I realized that this anger at the 
characters is exactly what makes 
the book so appealing. Betty 
Smith makes you uncomfortable 
and gets you riled up until 
eventually you start feeling for 
the most unlikely people. “A Tree 
Grows in Brooklyn” is about the 
harsh realities of immigrant 
struggle in the 20th century, 
but Smith writes about these 
obstacles in a way that everyone 
can relate to. The characters are 
raw and vulnerable, but so is the 
text itself.
Looking back, I think this 
vulnerability was the reason 
why “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” 
became 
my 
drug. 
There’s 
something about the story of 
the Nolan family that seems far-
fetched, yet entirely possible to 
sympathize with. It’s as necessary 
a read for a middle school girl as 
it is a middle-aged adult. You’ll 
laugh, cry and be humbled all at 
the same time. “A Tree Grows in 
Brooklyn” has earned its spot on 
my kitchen island for two reasons: 
So much of my life revolved 
around it when I was young and 
so much still does.

BOOKS THAT BUILT US

When “Love, Simon” starts, 
it’s a little jarring. Visually, the 
film uses a vocabulary of sticky-
sweet teen romcom, a beautiful, 
heterosexual nuclear family, a 
young protagonist who just isn’t 
understood and a curated, too-
keenly teenager wardrobe and 
bedroom out of “The O.C” or 
“Teen Wolf.” But with director 
Greg Berlanti at the helm, perhaps 
that should come as no surprise. 
However, when the film decides 
to reveal the gag (which doesn’t 
take long) that high schooler and 
protagonist Simon Spier (Nick 
Robinson, “Melissa & Joey”) is 
in the closet, it takes a second to 
adjust. 
So often, queer cinema finds its 
leads on the fringes, or at least out 
of the spotlight of the mainstream. 
Elio and Oliver of “Call Me By 
Your Name” are sequestered in 
a small Italian village; Jack and 
Ennis of “Brokeback Mountain” 
hide in the eponymous range; 
Carol and Therese of “Carol” can 
only consummate their love on 
the road, in motels. One of the 
best elements of “Love, Simon” 
is Simon’s presence in a world 
that is accessible. The film firmly 
roots him in his locale — a pretty, 
spacious Georgia suburb. In some 
ways, it feels like tacet acceptance 

before the plot even gets in motion.
In other ways, however, the 
clean world of the teen romcom and 
depictions of Simon’s queerness 
come in tension. Robinson checks 
all the boxes of what one could 
expect of a straight male lead, 
the only “clear” signal of his 
queerness being his participation 
in theatre: Does that mean the film 
falls prey to heteronormativity or 

does that mean that gay people 
are able to be represented in 
new ways on screen? Certainly, 
the world Berlanti crafts has 
space 
for 
characters 
that 
embody 
“traditional” 
ideas 
of 
homosexuality 
on 
screen, 
like one of Simon’s classmates, 
Ethan (Clark Moore, “TURN: 
Washington’s Spies”). Robinson’s 
less than macho but still assuredly 
masculine performance, then, is 
puzzling. 
While 
there 
is 
room 
for 
criticism 
about 
the 
power 
structures 
that 
underpin 
“Love, Simon,” they actually 
allow Robinson to express his 
indignation to those that oppress 
him. Queer leads usually have to 
operate in the shadows, or placate, 

or acquiesce to those that discover 
their sexuality. They are forced to 
resign themselves to their lot — 
but not Simon. His first emotion, 
both when he is outed (online, no 
less) and viciously mocked in the 
cafeteria afterward, is rage. He 
writhes in his sheets in the first 
case and confronts the jocks in the 
second, with no trace of world-
crushing shame or anguish in his 
face in either scene. Rarely is gay 
anger shown as confidently and 
justifiably as it is in “Love, Simon.” 
The film is at its best as it tracks 
Simon’s coming-out, despite its 
billing as a teen romcom. Since 
the romance in “Love, Simon” 
develops over email, it takes a 
backseat to the real-life drama of 
the second and third acts. Berlanti 
gives Simon three possible love 
interests over the course of the 
film, which keeps some interest, 
but when Simon and his crush, 
Blue, finally meet in real life, 
there’s something missing. The 
excitement, and quite honestly, 
the erotic passion of what is a 
long-anticipated first kiss elude 
them. The boys kiss with no 
intensity or handsiness that the 
moment warrants. Despite these 
flaws, “Love, Simon” enters the 
much-needed, near non-existent 
category of feel-good queer films. 
I can imagine thousands of queer 
kids getting so much from this 
film, from seeing a new possibility 
of being gay in our time.

‘Love, Simon’ joins the few 
feel-good queer movies

Michigan’s offense explodes in 99-72 win over Texas A&M; Wolverines heading to Elite Eight 

LOS ANGELES, Calif. — All 

of John Beilein’s Sweet Sixteen 
appearances had been more 
drama-filled than a Hollywood 
soap opera. In 2013, Trey 
Burke’s 
game-tying 
three 

against Kansas — possibly the 
most glorified shot in program 
history — gave the Michigan 
men’s basketball coach his 
first 
second-weekend 
win 

in unbelievable, come-from-
behind fashion. Last year, the 
Wolverines came within inches 
of the Elite Eight, as Derrick 
Walton’s 
buzzer-beating 

triple attempt fell just short in 
Kansas City.

But on Thursday, such nail-

biting, angst-filled moments 
weren’t necessary. The third-
seeded 
Wolverines 
(31-7 

overall) 
dominated 
from 

start to finish, cruising to a 
99-72 drubbing of No. 7 seed 
Texas A&M (22-12) at the 
Staples Center in Los Angeles. 
Michigan has now earned its 
14th Elite Eight appearance in 
program history — or 12th, if 
you’re on board with the NCAA 
pretending that 1992 and 1993 
never happened.

Oddly, the game was perhaps 

best summarized by its first 
basket. 
Aggie 
point 
guard 

T.J. 
Starks 
found 
forward 

Tyler Davis, a member of 
Texas A&M’s mammoth front 
court that figured to carry 
a sizable advantage. But the 
pass was errant, forcing Davis 
to wildly save it into the arms 
of 
sophomore 
point 
guard 

Zavier Simpson. From there, 
senior guard Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman and Moritz 
Wagner played a two-man in 
transition, eventually leading 
to one of many easy bucks for 
the German center.

It 
was 
the 
first 
of 
14 

turnovers for Texas A&M, one 
of seven team-leading assists 
for Abdur-Rahkman and two 
of 21 points for 
Wagner. Abdur-
Rahkman 
also 
led 
the 

Wolverines with 
24 points — one 
of four Michigan 
players to reach 
double-figures. 

That 

Wolverine 
offense 
that 

dripped 
with 

frustration, 
missed 
shots 

and disharmony? It stayed 
in 
Wichita. 
Michigan 
shot 

62 percent from the floor, 
drained 
14 
three-pointers 

from eight different players 
— a Tournament record — to 

score its second-
highest total of 
the season.

“When we got 

back 
Monday 

watching 
the 

film, we knew 
we were so much 
better than what 
we 
played,” 

said 
fifth-year 

senior 
Duncan 

Robinson. “And 

that’s encouraging when you 
go 2-0 and beat two really good 
teams in a weekend and don’t 

play your best. Today might 
have been close to our best, 
quite honestly.”

The Wolverines came out 

of the gates raining shots on 
Thursday, 
making 
four 
of 

their first five to grab an early 
lead. After the first media 
timeout, the Aggies shifted 
to a 2-3 zone defense — a look 
that Michigan has struggled 
against all season. It didn’t 
make a difference.

At the 12:14 mark, sophomore 

guard Ibi Watson — who had 
hit just nine 3-pointers all year 
— flicked his wrist from the 
left corner. It hit pure nylon. 
A 
minute 
later, 
Robinson 

launched a triple that hit 

the rim twice before finding 
a home through the hoop. 
Then Simpson nailed one. So 
did Wagner. As did redshirt 
sophomore 
Charles 
Matthews. 
It 
seemed 
so 

easy 
that 
the 

Wolverines felt 
like they were 
being slighted.

“We’re 

so 
used 
to 

being 
heavily 

contested 
and 

not being able 
to get into our offense,” said 
freshman guard Jordan Poole. 
“Being able to get the open 

looks that we had today was 
kind of like a shocker to us.

“We 
felt 
a 
little 

disrespected.”

All 
told, 
the 
Wolverines 

drained seven 3-pointers — 
from seven different players 
— to gain a lopsided, 21-point 
lead before the eight-minute 
mark. 
They 
looked 
like 
a 

juggernaut. Texas A&M looked 
like anything but.

Failing to find any semblance 

of rhythm, the Aggies turned 
it over 10 times in the first 
half. 
A 
bad 
pass 
here, 
a 

missed shot there. Offensive 
ineptitude 
everywhere. 
The 

team that exploded for 86 
points against North Carolina 
last weekend — the defending 
national champion Tar Heels 
that torched the Wolverines 
in November — was a shell of 
itself.

There 
was 
a 
regression 

toward the mean in the second 
frame. The Aggies pounded 
the ball inside to re-establish a 
functioning offense. Michigan, 
naturally, didn’t spit fire like it 
did in the first.

But it didn’t matter. Like a 

flawed movie script, there was 
little conflict involved; the 
game was over long before the 
final buzzer sounded. And for 
the Wolverines, the victory is 

further 
proof 

that they belong, 
now sitting only 
one win away 
from the Final 
Four.

“It shows for 

us and for the 
people watching 
that we didn’t 
get 
lucky,” 

said 
freshman 

forward 
Isaiah 

Livers. “We didn’t just hit a 
lucky shot. I believe in destiny, 
so we’re destined to be here.”

Welcome to Michigan’s circus

L

OS 
ANGE-
LES, 

Calif. — Wel-
come one, 
welcome all.

I’d like to 

introduce 
you 
to 
the 

circus 
show 

put on by the 
Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 
team 
during 

Thursday’s 
Sweet 
Sixteen 

matchup against Texas A&M. 
It’s possible that you saw the 
traveling ensemble in Wichita, 
Kan. for the first two games 
of the NCAA Tournament, but 
I want to assure you that this 
99-72 victory is a much, much 
more scintillating experience.

Jordan Poole’s buzzer-beater 

to top Houston was surely an 
exciting ending though, right?

“We can’t do that again,” 

said freshman forward Isaiah 
Livers. “You don’t get miracles 
like that everyday. We gotta 
hit them first in the mouth and 
keep going from there.”

If you buy a ticket, you will 

find that this show actually 
hits the ground running this 
time. It has the unusual and the 
unexpected with a flare of the 
familiar, say, as if John Beilein 
and elite offense are friends 
again.

The price of admission for 

Michigan’s 
performance at 
Staples 
Center 

is $6 for Section 
311, 
according 

to StubHub. If 
you want 100-
level seats, I’m 
not your guy. But 
when 
none 
of 

your hometown 
teams 
are 

playing 
I 

understand why you would 
want to watch at home with 
some popcorn anyway. They 
have that here too, you know, if 
you have another $6.

This show isn’t what everyone 

was reading about in the papers 
all 
week. 
The 
Wolverines 

were 
well 
aware 
that 
the 

Aggies’ Robert Williams and 

Tyler 
Davis 

were 
gigantic 

showmen 
themselves, but 
they 
are 
only 

given 
minor 

roles 
in 
this 

performance 
(Yes, 
spoiler, 

Williams 
flies 

to swat an Ibi 
Watson 
layup. 

And a Charles 

Matthew layup. Maybe a few 
dunks, here and there. It’s not 
kid-friendly stuff).

As you walk in prior to the 

show, you’ll hear fans wearing 

maroon and white chant the 
Aggie War Hymn. After that, 
you will never hear it again.

The circus begins.
It starts with a classic circus 

staple — fire. You’ll see it 
throughout the performance — 
Michigan shoots 61.9 percent 
from the field — but not as much 
as at the commencement. In 
fact, the performers might have 
more fun than you. Seven of 
the Wolverines’ will be riding 
the 3-pointer carousel, hitting 
from beyond the arc one-by-
one before repeating — a truly 
remarkable feat.

“This 
is 
definitely 
who 

we are,” said senior guard 
Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-

Rahkman. “We knew that we 
didn’t play that well in Wichita, 
that left a bad taste in our 

mouth. We just got a second 
chance and we came to LA to 
prove the team that we actually 
are.”

While the carousel spins, 

the fans will see 
some sleight of 
hand tricks from 
Zavier Simpson. 
The sophomore 
point guard can 
give pause to any 
ball-handler, 
and Thursday’s 
victim, 
T.J. 

Starks, displays 
Simpson swiping 
it from his hands 
in each of his five turnovers. 
You can try wiping your glasses, 
but he’s just that quick.

Treys 
and 
turnovers 
are 

specialties for Michigan, but in 

this show, even the previously 
unseen 
happens. 
Abdur-

Rahkman will drain a three as 
part of his 24 points, and he 
cracks a smile and pirouettes 

back 
into 

defense.

Fifth-year 

senior 
Duncan 

Robinson 
will 

prove 
that 
he 

can, 
indeed, 

jump 
as 
he 

slams it home 
after a Simpson 
steal to get the 
Wolverines’ 
biggest lead of 

29.

After 
intermission, 
the 

show does not stop. Redshirt 
sophomore 
guard 
Charles 

Matthews will dance around 

the paint freely, hitting elbow 
jumpers and driving to the 
hoop from both sides. A few 
pump fakes sends the Aggies’ 
Davis soaring high in the air.

When Texas A&M puts on a 

full-court press at the end of 
the lopsided tilt, it’s hard to 
blame the Wolverines for some 
sloppy turnovers. After putting 
on a near-perfect exhibit, who 
wouldn’t get nervous about 
ending with a bang?

And a wacky bang they will 

find.

“From a mental side of 

things, it’s hard to be in the 
moment when you’re up 24,” 
said 
assistant 
coach 
Luke 

Yaklich. “… It is a little bit of 
disbelief. But you’re so happy 
for those kids.”

A gliding Jaaron Simmons 

lobs a rainbow to a reaching 
Austin Davis for the alley-oop. 
Moritz Wagner, tongue out, 
nearly runs into the tunnel.

And for the final possession, 

even walk-on freshman C.J. 
Baird gets his opportunity in 
the limelight for the first time 
since Dec. 21. With the shot 
clock dwindling and space in 
front of him, Baird will sink his 
first career 3-pointer. Everyone 
gets in on the fun.

“It’s the best feeling of my 

life,” Baird said. “I told Ibi 
Watson when I got in there 
I’m gonna shoot it and he said 
‘Okay, do it then.’ I was kinda 
nervous when (Simmons) called 
me because I’m like ‘Oh, they 
actually want me to do this.’ I 
didn’t think they’d actually let 
me do it. ”

It’s a picture-perfect ending 

to an already picture-perfect 
game, even if the tricks weren’t 
expected. And if by chance you 
don’t get to see the circus live, 
please don’t worry.

It’ll be back on Saturday for 

the Elite Eight. The tricks are 
to be determined.

Twenty years later, Pearson and Michigan find themselves in similar position

It was supposed to be a rebuilding 

year.

Entering the 1997-98 season, 

the Michigan hockey team was left 
without arguably the greatest class 
in program history. The offseason 
saw nine seniors — known as the 
“Michigan Nine” — graduate. The 
Wolverines were without six of 
their top eight scorers from the 
previous year.

Gone 
was 
three-time 
All-

American, two-time CCHA Player 
of the Year and 1997 Hobey Baker 
winner Brendan Morrison. Gone 
were future NHL players John 
Madden, Jason Botterill, Warren 
Luhning and Blake Sloan, who 
combined for 187 points in their 
final seasons in Ann Arbor.

Gone was the core of the 1996 

national championship team that 
ended a 32-year title drought and 
gone was the heart of the 1997 
group that infamously fell to 
Boston University in the national 
semifinals.

Sure, star goaltender Marty 

Turco, forward Bill Muckalt and 
captain Matt Herr returned for their 
senior campaigns. But 11 incoming 
freshmen, including highly-touted 
forwards Josh Langfeld and Mark 
Kosick, needing to replace nine 
upperclassmen 
with 
offensive 

prowess was a thankless task.

“I think there was a lot of 

pressure,” said Michigan head 
coach Mel Pearson, who was then 
an assistant coach. “Everybody said, 
‘Ah, we lost the best class ever in the 
history of Michigan hockey.’ The 
freshmen were good, though. They 
contributed, but it wasn’t the same.”

And to start the season, it wasn’t.
For the first time in 36 games, the 

Wolverines lost at Yost Ice Arena, 
2-1, against Colgate. Then, they lost 
the Great Lakes Invitational for the 
first time in a decade. In their last 
six regular season games, they went 
a meager 3-3, including a sweep by 
Michigan State, winner of all four 
games between the two that year.

But through the toils came a 

veteran presence from the likes of 
Muckalt and Turco that helped the 

newcomers adjust to college hockey.

“It was the senior class, the class 

of Billy Muckalt, Matt Herr, Marty 
Turco and Chris Fox,” said then-
Michigan coach Red Berenson. 
“Those four in particular were big-
time college players and brought 
those freshmen along as the year 
went on to make them feel like they 
had a chance. And they did, they got 
better as the year went on.”

Added then-sophomore forward 

Andrew Merrick: “I think a big part 
was that there was not a lot of panic 
in that senior leadership. If you look 
at a guy like Marty Turco, not only 
was he an outstanding goaltender, 
he was calm all the time, even when 
we struggled as a team.”

In the first game of the season 

against 
Minnesota, 
Herr 
was 

injured and hope for a victory all 
but lost. But Muckalt and Turco 
took over, leading by example and 
showing the young players how to 
work hard and win. 

“I think the older guys, my class 

included, who played with the guys 
before like Morrison, just taught 
us that losing was unacceptable,” 
Merrick said. “You were expected 
to win every time you went into the 
rink playing for Michigan.”

Michigan finished the regular 

season 27-9-1 with a 22-7-1 record 
in the CCHA, good for second in the 
conference, only one point behind 
the Spartans. The Wolverines were 
then upset by an up-and-coming 
Ohio State team in the CCHA 
semifinals.

“We didn’t win the regular 

season, 
we 
didn’t 
win 
the 

postseason, we didn’t win the GLI,” 
Pearson said. “We had an okay year 
and a pretty good team, but we 
didn’t win anything until we put it 
together.”

Added 
Merrick: 
“We 
were 

struggling heading into the NCAA 
Tournament, struggling to find an 
identity. I think the national people 
didn’t expect much. But I think as a 
group, we felt like we had a pretty 
good team and though we stumbled 
at times, we had a lot of talent. We 
had good players there, so it was a 
matter of coming together at the 
right time.”

After late regular season losses 

to Michigan State and a postseason 
blunder against the Buckeyes, 
Michigan settled for a No. 3 seed in 
the NCAA West Regional.

The NCAA West Regional that 

happened to be at Yost.

***
It was supposed to be a rebuilding 

year.

After 33 years with Berenson at 

the helm, Pearson was named head 
coach to begin the 2017-18 season. 
Under an unfamiliar coaching staff 
came new systems and the daunting 
undertaking to merge a strong — 
yet inexperienced — six-player 
freshmen class with 21 returning 
skaters.

Highly uncharacteristic for the 

storied program, Michigan was 
coming off its first losing season 
since 2012-13, a dismal 13-19-3 
campaign. On top of that, captains 
Alex Kile and Nolan De Jong’s 
four years elapsed, leaving the 
Wolverines without their previous 
leading goal-scorer and defensive 
mainstay.

Michigan 
was 
projected 
to 

finish second-to-last in the Big Ten 
Preseason Coaches’ Poll. No one 
gave the Wolverines a chance to 
survive the gauntlet of conference 
heavyweights, especially with the 
new addition of Notre Dame.

At first, it looked like the 

prediction would be true.

More than halfway through 

the year, Michigan was unranked 
at 8-10-2, with a GLI loss and an 
NCAA 
Tournament 
berth 
far 

from the realm of possibility. A 
season-ending injury to sophomore 
forward Will Lockwood in January 
left the Wolverines without one of 
their offensive focal points.

The third-youngest team in the 

country looked its age and was on 
a downward spiral into college 
hockey oblivion. Maybe second-
to-last in the Big Ten was a fair 
assessment for a program enduring 
major transitions.

There were obvious growing 

pains for a team lacking an identity. 
There were countless metaphors 
from Pearson about all players 
having to take a shovel and help 
dig, not being the weak link in the 
chain. Not to mention the repetitive 

mantra about skaters needing to buy 
into the system.

At first, it was senior forward 

Tony Calderone and junior forward 
Cooper Marody leading the way. 
Along with senior forward Dexter 
Dancs, their line accounted for 
almost 40 percent of the Wolverines’ 
total points on the season. And 
when “DMC” went silent, Michigan 
didn’t have anyone else to lead.

“We’ve 
had 
some 
adversity 

this year,” Muckalt, now one of 
Pearson’s assistant coaches, said. 
“And sometimes where — I don’t 
want to say we failed — we realized 
that it’s not working.”

Then something clicked.
First came the sweep against 

then-No. 9 Minnesota — the 
Wolverines’ first in Minneapolis in 
41 years. Then another against then-
No. 12 Penn State.

Then came help from secondary 

scorers. 
With 
Calderone 
and 

Marody contributing only one 
point between the two of them over 
a three-week span, it was rookie 
forwards Dakota Raabe, Michael 
Pastujov and Jack Becker and 
defenseman Quinn Hughes who 
rose to the occasion with timely 
goals and assists throughout. As 
Pearson put it, “We need everybody, 
they aren’t freshmen anymore.”

Goaltender 
Hayden 
Lavigne 

solidified the starting job with 
continued consistency in net. The 
sophomore won 10 of the last 16 
regular season games with a 2.31 
goals against average and .915 save 
percentage over the span.

Michigan went 10-3-1 in its last 

14 regular season games, including 
another sweep against then-No. 
1 Notre Dame and a nation’s-best 
eight-game unbeaten streak. After 
sweeping Wisconsin in the Big Ten 
Tournament quarterfinals’ best-of-
three series, the Wolverines then 
fell in overtime to Ohio State in the 
semifinals.

From being out of contention 

early in the season to one of the 
hottest teams in the country, 
Michigan is now primed to make 
a run in the Tournament, perhaps 
even destined for its 10th national 
championship and first since 1998.

A No. 2 seed in the Northeastern 

Region, the road to postseason glory 
starts in Worcester, Mass., only one 
hour from where the Wolverines 
last won the title.

As 
Michigan 
prepares 
for 

Saturday’s 
NCAA 
Tournament 

regional 
matchup 
against 

Northeastern, the eerie similarities 
between this year and 1998 are 
aplenty.

The 
teams 
were 
both 

underestimated 
 
entering 
this 

season yet strived to dismiss 
skeptics. And coming down the 
stretch, both iterations of Michigan 
hockey started to fire on all 
cylinders when it mattered most.

It’s also noted by those who 

have been around the team the 
past 20 years that current players 
inexplicably mimic the play of those 
who led the Tournament run in 
1998.

Calderone has been compared 

to Herr and Muckalt by Merrick 
and Berenson, the fearless leader 
posting career numbers and a team-
leading 23 goals.

Marody shows shades of Hayes 

and his wicked right-handed shot. 
He mirrors the Michigan great 
who was “very good with the 
puck, smart, stealthy,” according to 
Merrick. Now a color commentator 
for 
Michigan 
Hockey 
Radio, 

Merrick added, “(Hayes was) not 
the quickest guy, but deliberate 
and makes smart decisions with 
the puck, so there are similarities 
there.”

Senior defenseman Sam Piazza 

is like Fox in Pearson’s eyes, both 
prize students of hockey and 
in the classroom. Fox is now a 
neurosurgeon, 
Pizza 
a 
finalist 

for the Senior CLASS award, 
recognizing student athletes who 
thrive on and beyond the ice.

Junior 
defensemen 
Joseph 

Cecconi and Nicholas Boka reflect 
blueliners Mike Van Ryn and David 
Huntzicker, skaters who Merrick 
called “a little unheralded, but could 
play.”

Then there’s Lavigne. Pearson, 

Berenson and Merrick agree he’s 
no Marty Turco — arguably the 
greatest goaltender in Michigan 
history and a player who entered 

1998 with a national championship 
under his belt. But albeit status or 
previous postseason experience, all 
mentioned Lavigne’s resurgence in 
the back-half of the season and how 
he quickly turned into the backbone 
of the Wolverines.

“You’ve got Hayden Lavigne 

coming 
into 
his 
own 
since 

Christmas,” Berenson said. “You 
don’t have a Marty Turco who’s 
coming off an unbelievable career. 
But you definitely have a chance 
… and I think this team has got a 
chance.”

Pearson and his coaching staff — 

all “Michigan Men” with postseason 
success — have continuously drawn 
on the comparisons of the 1998 team 
and 2018 version to remind their 
team they can win it all, too.

Maybe this team won’t have the 

same success as the 1998 national 
champions. But the parallels can’t 
be ignored.

And it’s the 1998 team’s mindset 

that Pearson hopes his current 
players will emulate heading into 
the Tournament.

In many 1998 interviews with 

The Michigan Daily, Herr was 
quick to point out that Michigan 
may not have been the nation’s most 
talented team, but it would always 
be the hardest-working.

Pearson 
concurs 
with 
the 

confidence exhibited that season 
and says the same holds true this 
year.

“Yeah, maybe we weren’t the 

best team, just like this year,” he 
said. “We didn’t finish first in 
our conference, but can we beat 
Notre Dame in one game? Yeah. 
Can we beat Northeastern in one 
game? Yeah. Can we beat — yeah, 
absolutely we can. And I think 
that’s the beauty of the NCAA, 
whether it’s basketball or hockey. 
It’s one game. You don’t have to beat 
someone in a series, you don’t have 
to play a 24-game league schedule. 
It’s just one game.

“I don’t think personnel-wise we 

have the best team. … (But) you have 
some special teams and I think this 
is one of them.”
