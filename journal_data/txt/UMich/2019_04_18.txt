An 
interactive 
audio-visual 
installation 
aiming to bring attention to opera singer 
Samuel Schultz’s healing after an alleged 
assault by School of Music, Theatre & Dance 
professor David Daniels was unveiled in the 
SMTD Soderquist Atrium this morning. The 
installation is comprised of three speakers 
playing recordings of Schultz sharing his side 
of the story and a rolling counter projection 
estimating Daniels’s pay by the University of 
Michigan since he was placed on administrative 
leave in August 2018.
Schultz’s allegations of rape against Daniels 
and his husband Scott Waltersin 2010 broke 
in a New York Daily News article published in 
August 2018. Daniels was placed on leave from 
the University later that month, shortly after the 
allegations became public. 
Further reporting by The Daily uncovered 
multiple attempts by Daniels to solicit sex from 
University students on Grindr, a dating app for 
gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people. The 
Daily also found evidence the University was 
made aware of sexual misconduct allegations 
by University students against Daniels in March 
2018, though they awarded him tenure in May.
In an email to The Daily, University 
spokeswoman Kim Broekhuizen wrote that 
Daniels is on paid leave.

When the baristas at Mighty Good 
Coffee formed a union last fall, they 
intended to stop their employers from 
discriminating against workers. Now 
the members of the Washtenaw Area 
Coffee Workers’ Association are nego-
tiating severance pay as the owners of 
the local specialty coffee chain prepare 
to shutter all of Mighty Good’s stores 
across the city by the end of August. 
The first location to close its doors will 
be the Main Street location in Kerry-
town, which is slated to close Friday.
An April 15 letter from Timothy 
Ryan, an attorney representing the 
chain’s owners, Nic Sims and David 
Myers, informed employees they were 
being terminated.
“Nic and David have concluded 
that they are not well suited to oper-
ate a retail operation,” the letter states. 
“They have found the experience to 
be overly stressful. It has created an 
unworkable burden on their relation-
ship and their family.”
On Tuesday, baristas at Mighty 
Good Coffee protested the termination 
notice, which informed some workers 
they would be losing their jobs in less 
than a week. The employees demon-
strated outside of Mighty Good’s loca-
tion on South University Avenue, which 
will close on May 5.
Mandy Gallegos, a barista at Mighty 

Good’s Arbor Hills store, which is set to 
close Aug. 31, said the workers wanted 
to draw attention to what was happen-
ing at the company.
“We’re trying to let people know that 
union-busting is a real thing,” Gallegos 
said. “The unfortunate part in all of this 
is that the Arbor Hills location will still 
be open, and so the unionized baristas 
will be working there, which will be 
very awkward for a lot of us.”
Sims and Ryan did not respond to 
multiple requests for comment. Mul-
tiple Mighty Good employees told The 
Daily the owners were not responding 
to any press inquiries.
The letter informing employees of 
Mighty Good’s intention to shut down 
all of its stores came exactly one week 
after the employees’ union filed an 
unfair labor practices complaint against 
the company with the National Labor 
Relations Board. 
Gallegos said the cause of the com-
plaint was due to the fact that Mighty 
Good Coffee was “short staffing their 
workers.”
“Recently, we filed a ULP — which 
is an unfair labor practice — against 
them due to short staffing us chroni-
cally for the past few months,” Gallegas 
said. “And after they got that ULP they 
sent us an email via the lawyer saying 
that they were closing up all four of the 

shops and laying off all of the employ-
ees.”
An initial letter informing Mighty 
Good of the complaint against the com-
pany was sent on April 9, according to 
the NLRB case docket.
One source close to WACWA, who 
asked to remain anonymous due to 
ongoing negotiations with Mighty 
Good, said the owners’ decision to close 
seemed to be related to the filing of the 
NLRB case.
“It could seem that way definitely,” 
they said. “That’s one of those things 
that you can never be certain about but 
you’ll pretty much always suspect.”
Gallegos said the union formed in the 
fall to bargain for better conditions and 
equal treatment after a fellow barista 
quit over accusations of racial discrimi-
nation, adding that Myers and Sims, 
the company’s owners, were not happy 
with the workers’ decision to form a 
union.
“We 
union-
ized 
because 
of a racial allegation against our work 
where one of our coworkers — a Black 
co-worker — was being underpaid com-
pared to all of our white co-workers, 
so we unionized so we could just have 
opportunity and equal treatment in our 
workplace — better working conditions 
— and unfortunately, they did not like 
that,” Gallegos said. “They thought it 

was retaliation, and we’ve been work-
ing toward our union contract for the 
past few months with them, with the 
Mighty Good owners and their lawyer.”
Nya Njee was the barista who quit. 
She worked at Mighty Good for two 
years, but said she left after she discov-
ered she was being paid less than her 
white coworkers. 
In an interview with The Daily in 
August, Njee said her wages did not 
increase while she worked at Mighty 
Good despite receiving complementary 
performance reviews. Njee said she 
realized something was “kind of weird” 
when she mentioned not getting a pay 
raise to her owner and manager and 
they looked like “deer caught in head-
lights.”
“It just kept staying with me and it 
was bothering me the whole time and 
so when I found that my coworkers, 
like junior coworkers, some of whom 
didn’t have any coffee experience, had 
gotten raises before me, I was immedi-
ately like, well, that’s interesting since 
I’m literally the only Black woman 
in the whole company, and it was 
just unfortunately pretty obvious 
as soon as I heard that my junior 
coworkers — non-Black coworkers 
— were receiving raises before me,” 
Njee said.

On 
April 
9, 
legislators 
introduced 
two 
bills 
into 
the 
Michigan 
House 
of 
Representatives 
that 
could 
impact free speech on college 
campuses. 
The first of the two bills, 
called the “Campus Free Speech 
Act,” could affect the number 
of public areas for free speech. 
If a demonstration or exercise 
goes against the four justifiable 
reasons to limit free speech, 
which are demonstrators who 
are deemed a public threat, 
other platforms for expression, 
assembly and distribution of 
literature can still occur and 
the campus has no free speech 
zones. If all of these criteria 
are met, public universities will 
have the right to intervene.
Currently, the University of 
Michigan is not legally allowed 
to ban speakers who use “hate 
speech” from their facilities 
unless they pose a threat to 
the community. In February, 
the University concluded that 
housing staff are not allowed 
to remove hate speech from 
student doors.

Wednesday night, more than 
100 people attended a panel dis-
cussion titled “Understanding 
the Social Implications of AI.” 
The panel, part of the Disso-
nance Event Series, was held in 
the Michigan League.
Organizing 
Committee 
Member Sol Bermann, chief 
privacy officer and interim 
chief information security offi-
cer for the University of Michi-
gan, explained Dissonance lies 
at the intersection of many dif-
ferent areas of study.
“Dissonance is what I like 
to call a grassroots faculty and 
student effort to take a multi-

disciplinary approach to issues 
at the confluence of technology, 
policy, privacy, security and 
law,” Bermann said.
Bermann said Dissonance 
makes an effort to incorporate 
perspectives from many dif-
ferent schools and organiza-
tions housed at the University. 
He listed LSA, the College of 
Engineering, the School of Pub-
lic Health, the School of Public 
Policy, the Medical School and 
the Law School as a few of the 
many past participants.
“As we were putting the 
series together, we wanted to 
get a range of perspectives,” 
Bermann said. “We didn’t just 
want it to be coming from a pro 
perspective or a con perspec-

tive. When you put the pro and 
con together you get a sort of 
clash: dissonance.”
Bermann said he believes 
the University provides the 
unique capacity as a world-
class research institution to 
pull in-house speakers together 
and provide informative panels 
such as the panel on Artificial 
Intelligence. He explained Dis-
sonance focuses on issues that 
relate to current events, a cat-
egory in which he believes AI 
falls.
 “AI is increasingly a known 
commodity in your daily life, 
but do you even think about it 
anymore?” Bermann said. “Do 
you think about the way you’re 
seeing the things you see on 

Amazon, or on Facebook, or on 
the news? Do you think about 
who’s presenting those things 
to you? Do you think about 
what it means to have autono-
mous vehicles versus having the 
responsibility of driving a car? 
Do you think about the algo-
rithms and how transparent 
they are or aren’t because those 
algorithms, again, are influenc-
ing our daily life.”
Bermann said because col-
lege-age students are on the 
cusp of the “digital age,” never 
having known a time before cell 
phones or the Internet, they are 
less likely to question the merits 
of AI.

doing there? What do you 
hope to gain from that 
experience?

A: “I am going to Nepal to 
help create ceramic water 
filters and to implement clean 
water educational initiatives 
and community engagement. 
Right now, kids are getting 
really sick from diseases 
that are totally preventable 
if they had access to clean 
water. Clear water should be 
a basic human right but sadly 
that isn’t the case. I am really 
excited to learn about the 
culture there and meet the 
Nepali people. Also I am going 
with a really great team so I 
hope we can learn a lot and 
use our skill set to help them.”

Members 
of 
Students 
for 
Holocaust 
Awareness, 
Remembrance and Education 
gathered 
on 
the 
Diag 
Wednesday for an annual 
vigil, a 24-hour reading of the 
names of those who died in the 
Holocaust.
SHARE 
president 
Alexa 
Porter, Business junior, said 

the reading of the names builds 
understanding of the lasting 
impact of the Holocaust.
“We’re trying to remember 
those 
who 
perished 
in 
the 
Holocaust 
and 
really 
understand the impact that 
it has on (people), not only 
families and memories, but 
also daily lives,” Porter said. 
“We’re 
trying 
to 
remind 
people that even though the 
Holocaust happened, at this 
point very long ago, it still 

affects people and beyond that 
there are still a lot of cases 
of 
genocide, 
unfortunately, 
happening.”
Porter said the event is 
intended 
to 
showcase 
the 
extent 
and 
magnitude 
of 
the deaths and destruction 
brought by the Holocaust. 
“The rate they usually say is 
something like 600-650 names 
per hour,” Porter said. “That 
means we usually get through 
all of our books and have to 
start over, but that still is 
nowhere near the number of 
people who actually died in 
the Holocaust.”
LSA senior Melissa Berlin, 
a SHARE member, said the 
large number of names they 
have to read creates the 
necessity for the length of 
the event.
“The fact that it takes 24 
hours to read names and 
we’re still not done is very 
impactful,” Berlin said. “It 
pulls together a lot of people 
coming together to do these 
small, half-hour shifts and 
yet its still not everything.”
Berlin said the event is 
important 
for 
the 
many 
students that may not think 
about the implications of the 
Holocaust day to day.
“I think that it’s something 
that 
people 
don’t 
think 
about very much in their 
daily 
lives,” 
Berlin 
said. 
“Especially for members in 
our community, it feels very 
salient but for the rest of the 
community it’s just a piece 
of history. Sort of having it 
here and having this very big 

statement kind of, it puts it on 
people’s radar once a year and 
gives pause to think.”
LSA 
senior 
Jocelyn 
Brickman also brought up 
how many people on campus 
may not often think about 
the historical significance of 
the Holocaust, which is why 
having the event is important 
each year.
“I think it’s really important 
because it’s something we 
don’t think about in our daily 
life or everyday,” Brickman 
said. “To have one full day 
dedicated to remembering the 
people, especially in a public 
place like this, is important 
because I definitely wouldn’t 
have known or don’t think 
about it unless I walk by and 
see it.”
Many student volunteers, 
both 
those 
involved 
with 
SHARE 
and 
otherwise, 
participated in the reading of 
the names. Porter said she is 
happy to see the involvement 
of the student community.
“We have a lot of people 
who literally will come by 
and say ‘Wow, I’m so happy 
you’re doing this,’” Porter 
said. “People will sometimes 
share 
stories 
that 
they’ve 
known survivors or travelled 
to any of the camps or been 
to any memorials. We even 
have people that will say ‘Oh, 
I didn’t even know you were 
doing this, can I sit and read 
for a couple of minutes.’”

ATTICUS RAASCH 
Daily Staff Reporter


Ken Kollman, a professor of 
political science, is familiar with 
constitutional law and believes 
it’s best for free speech to be 
uninhibited until it becomes 
threatening. 
“I think like most faculty I’m 
generally in favor of free speech 
unless it’s dangerous and incites 
violence,” Kollman said. “When 
possible, when there’s no threat 
to the people or the public order, 
then it’s better to allow people to 
speak on campuses.”
The second bill, the “College 
Campus 
Intellectual 
and 
Expressive 
Freedom 
Act,” 
provides standards to ensure 
protections 
for 
free 
speech, 
with nine different statements 
with which universities would 
have to update their policies. For 
instance, anyone who is brought 
in by an organization or faculty 
member would be allowed to 
speak. 
This would allow controversial 
figures — such as conservative 
commentator Ben Shapiro, who 
spoke at the University in March 
— to visit campus with fewer 
obstacles.
Vidhya Aravind, School of 
Information graduate student, 
worked on the #StopSpencer 
campaign when white nationalist 
Richard Spencer attempted to 
visit the University last year. 
Aravind said she finds the bills 
ridiculous and believes they 
would only allow for more hate 
speech on campus.
Aravind had invited Alice 
Walker, an American novelist 
and activist, to speak on campus 
back in 2013, but her visit was 
canceled due to her involvement 
with the Boycott, Divestment 
and 
Sanctions 
movement, 
a 
Palestinian-led 
campaign 
seeking “justice in Israel.” 
“The University does not give 
platforms to marginalized view 
points,” Aravind said. “It doesn’t 
give platforms in particular to 
Palestinian students and the 
University does give an ear to 
conservative white students far 
more regularly.”

Aravind 
said 
she 
finds 
the second bill in particular 
extremely 
ineffective 
and 
ignorant of the real reason 
behind student protests.
“Part of the point of student 
protests is to be disruptive,” 
Aravind said. “When we protest 
we’re 
drawing 
attention 
to 
things that people are otherwise 
ignoring and typically that’s 
after trying to fight for change in 
other avenues.”
Ultimately, 
Aravind 
said 
she doesn’t think the bills will 
be effective and would not be 
surprised if the bills did not 
make it past the governor’s desk. 
State Rep. Yousef Rabhi, 
D-Mich., told The Daily in a 
previous interview on April 
3 that members of the House 
are concerned with outside 
organizations 
using 
public 
universities to share their 
hate. 
“I 
think 
at 
least 
(for) 
Democratic 
politicians, 
it’s 
definitely 
been 
something 
that’s high on the radar and 
that people are aware of,” Rabhi 
said. “Especially for folks who 
represent 
campuses, 
because 
a lot of these hate groups are 
coming to university campuses to 
spread their hateful messages.” 
Rabhi told The Daily that he 
personally is involved in crafting 
civil rights legislation that would 
fight hate speech, as well as the 
hate organizations themselves. 
Rabhi is worried, however, 
that some representatives are 
protecting hate speech by filing 
it under free speech. 
“Some 
of 
the 
negative 
legislation 
coming 
up, 
it 
generally is under the guise of 
free speech,” Rabhi said. “So 
often times people who are 
wanting to support and defend 
these organizations like the 
American Freedom Law Center 
and others are doing it with 
the guise of free speech and 
saying 
that 
universities 
and 
other 
organizations 
denying 
the opportunity for hate speech 
to occur is a violation of free 
speech.”

Njee demanded the com-
pany provide her with back 
pay to compensate her for 
the hours she worked with 
lower 
wages 
than 
those 
given to her coworkers. She 
said she filed complaints 
with the Michigan Depart-
ment of Civil Rights and the 
Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity 
Commission 
and 
planned to reach out to “as 
many employment discrimi-
nation and wage and hour 
departments and agencies 
as I can.”
“At that point, I was like, 
‘I’m sorry but I don’t work 
here because I like you, I 
work here for money, to be 
able to pay my bills,’ so I 
decided to walk out, to leave 
my job,” Njee said. “... I was 
just not comfortable what-
soever at that point. It was 
making me physically ill to 
be in that space and to be 
around them.”
According to VICE, Njee 
hired a lawyer and Mighty 
Good agreed to a settle-
ment at the end of 2018. In 
an interview with The Daily 
on Thursday, Njee said she 
had signed a nondisclosure 
agreement 
with 
Mighty 
Good and declined to com-
ment further.
In a statement posted to 
Mighty Good’s Twitter on 
Aug. 4, the day after Njee 
quit the job, the company 
said if changes were needed 
to improve the business for 
employees and customers, 
they would make them.
“We are deeply concerned 
about serious and disturb-
ing allegations of race dis-
criminations that have been 
made about our family busi-
ness,” the statement read. 
“Our value system drives 
our decisions and how we 
operate at every level. We 
have always strived to be 
inclusive, 
supportive 
and 
invested in our staff’s suc-
cess and professional devel-
opment.”
The company said they 
did not plan to make any 

further public postings, and 
have not posted on their 
Twitter account since then.
The letter sent to Mighty 
Good’s employees on Mon-
day offered them the oppor-
tunity to discuss a closing 
agreement 
with 
Mighty 
Good’s owners and their 
attorney on Tuesday. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Elias 
Khoury, 
a 
member 
of 
Democratic 
Socialists 
of 
America and a former staff 
member for The Daily, said 
he attended the meeting out 
of solidarity. He said about 
10 
union 
members 
were 
present, in addition to Sims 
and Ryan. He called the 
atmosphere “tense,” noting 
the two parties agreed that 
if Mighty Good were ever 
to reopen, there would be 
preferential hiring for cur-
rent employees. However, 
according to Khoury, the 
consensus ended there.
“That was something that 
the lawyer was totally on 
board with, but the main ask 
was the severance and they 
were not agreeing on that 
at all, and the workers were 
getting pretty upset and I 
could tell that the lawyer 
was getting kind of squea-
mish because it was him 
versus these 10 disgruntled 
workers,” Khoury said. “He 
wasn’t 
comfortable 
with 
that at all. Like I said earli-
er, the meeting was tense. It 
was not as if as though there 
was a lot of agreement, no 
one was saying kumbaya.”
Gallegos said severance 
pay was one of WACWA’s 
primary demands.
“All we can do is spread 
the word about unions, let 
people 
know 
that 
union 
busting is a real thing and 
work for equal treatment,” 
Gallegos said. “We’re just 
trying to get severance for 
the employees that are being 
laid off immediately.”

Alice Tracey contributed 
to reporting on this story.

“If you’re not thinking that 
there’s 
not 
some 
inherent 
risk in the ‘Big Brother’ in a 
machine doing things to you, 
then we’re doing you a misser-
vice,” Bermann said.
Business 
freshman 
Ian 
Cooper attended the Disso-
nance panel to take part in the 
exploration Bermann fears 
students are missing. Cooper 
is enrolled in an engineer-
ing course where he has been 
forced to think critically about 
AI. He told The Daily after the 
event that he came across an 
announcement on the Hap-
pening at Michigan webpage 
for the Dissonance event and 
thought it would be a proper 
supplement to his classwork.
“AI 
is 
basically 
chang-
ing the world as we know 
it,” Cooper said. “All of these 
distinguished 
professionals 
in different fields can really 
inform the way we think about 
it.”
Cooper appreciated Disso-
nance’s attention to interdis-
ciplinary exploration of the 
issue.
“It seems like a lot of people 
are just saying AI is going to 
ruin the economy and automa-
tion is going to make everyone 
jobless,” Cooper said. “I’m 
wondering if maybe some of 
these people will have more 
optimistic viewpoints.”
Panelist Ella Atkins, an 

aerospace engineering pro-
fessor, 
addressed 
Cooper’s 
concern about job loss during 
her presentation. From the 
perspective of her work with 
autonomous 
aircrafts, 
she 
has seen a reorganization of 
labor rather than a loss of jobs. 
She said there are the same 
amount of people being hired, 
but the jobs they are doing 
require a more advanced edu-
cation and elite technology.
“A lot of people are work-
ing together to solve prob-
lems that will make money for 
the company and hopefully 
benefit society,” Atkins said. 
“They’re just doing different 
jobs.”
Atkins presented on the 
neutrality 
of 
technology, 
explaining it is not inherently 
good or bad. Atkins said tech-
nology serves the purpose of 
those humans who employ it, 
no matter whether it is con-
structive or regressive to soci-
ety.
“It’s more complicated than 
not liking the AI, because peo-
ple have a long history of also 
doing some pretty good and 
some scary things,” Atkins 
said. “We expect the same 
thing from the AI agents … If 
we begin imagining all of the 
scary things that AI can do, 
maybe we forget two things. 
One, the scary things people 
can do, and the second thing is 
how the AI on the things like 
drones can help stop the scary 
things.” 
Panelist 
Kentaro 
Toya-

ma, 
professor 
of 
informa-
tion, began his presentation 
by 
emphasizing 
the 
other 
perspective 
of 
technology 
being neutral and malleable 
by human beings. Toyama 
presented a graph detailing 
how although technology has 
expanded rapidly over the 
course of the past decade, 
the poverty rate in America 
has remained stagnant. He 
said technology exacerbates 
inequality due to the human 
promotion of inequality.
“Technology, for the most 
part, amplifies other human 
forces,” Toyama said.
Toyama 
said 
he 
thinks 
technology has also deepened 
the country’s political divide 
because it provides a platform 
on which the conflict can 
brew.
“It’s entirely up to the 
human beings in terms of how 
the technology gets used,” 
Toyama said. “It could be 
positive, it could be negative. 
If we’re really confident it’s 
always going to be positive, I 
don’t see any reason why we 
shouldn’t develop more tech-
nology. On the other hand, if 
you have some doubts about 
that, we should be very care-
ful.”
Toyama equated the power 
of AI to the danger a nuclear 
bomb 
presents 
to 
society. 
Toyama said AI could be even 
more dangerous — there are 
only nine countries across the 
world with nuclear weapons, 
but AI is ever-present and 

growing more ubiquitous as 
technology continues to prog-
ress.
“There’s always going to be 
a cat and mouse game in terms 
of security versus people doing 
bad things online.” Toyama 
said. “...The law always tends 
to be behind the technology, 
and so for that reason, I think 
we need to have regulation in 
place that is actually a little 
conservative.”
Bermann said the purpose 
of Dissonance is to spark 
thought and conversation.
“When I was a child and 
watched cartoons like The 
Jetsons, they were science fic-
tions shows,” Bermann said. 
“If you had told me that the 
world today would be full of 
AI and autonomous this and 
that, I would have thought 
that was the most wonderful 
thing ever, but it’s not been as 
bright and rosy a scene as the 
cartoons and movies depict-
ed it to be. Instead, there are 
many dystopian things that 
are related to artificial intel-
ligence.”
Bermann said he hopes 
the panel event encouraged 
attendees 
to 
question 
AI, 
believing it is both a problem 
and a solution.
“I don’t think any of us, 
particularly in the AI space, 
presume to know the out-
comes yet, but we want to get 
people thinking about are we 
comfortable having machines 
making 
decisions 
on 
our 
behalf?” Bermann said.

“David 
Daniels 
remains 
on paid leave,” Broekhuizen 
wrote. 
“How 
long 
a 
U-M 
employee stays on paid leave is 
determined by the individual 
situation in each case and when 
facts may develop that have 
an impact on an employment 
decision.” 
The installation has been 
approved to remain up until 
April 
25. 
Titled 
“Pulling 
Strings,” 
it 
features 
three 
speaker boxes with strings 
dangling 
from 
them. 
The 
speakers play many overlapping 
recordings of Samuel Schultz 
reading his statement on the 
alleged rape, which is published 
on Schultz’s website. When one 
pulls on the strings, the other 
recordings fade away until only 
a single voice is left.
In an interview with The 
Daily, Music, Theatre & Dance 
senior Fisher Diede, the creator 
of the installation, explained 
how 
the 
interactive 
aspect 
highlights the abuse of power 
by large institutions through 
the metaphor “pulling strings.”
“The 
title 
of 
the 
piece, 
‘Pulling Strings,’ plays off the 
metaphor of pulling strings in 
positions of power and that is 
represented in the piece through 
hanging strings that the user is 
invited to pull on,” Diede said. 
“The way pulling strings affects 
the audio is directly playing on 
a metaphor that when certain 
strings are pulled certain voices 
are quieted or eliminated.”
In front of the speakers and 
above the entrance to McIntosh 
Theatre, a projection updates 
Daniels’ 
salary 
since 
being 
placed on paid leave. The figure 

has reached over $114,000 as of 
the date of publication. Diede 
said the figure was calculated 
based on how much Daniels 
made in 2018. 
Although Diede expressed 
understanding 
of 
the 
classification of his piece as 
a protest, he stated the main 
purpose of the installation was 
to emphasize Schultz’s strength 
and healing, as well as create a 
space for discussion. 
“It’s 
less 
so 
focused 
on 
(Schultz’s) allegations and more 
so focused on his healing,” 
Deide said. “I think the whole 
intent of this piece is to share a 
story from a voice that has been 
hushed quite a bit already and 
I think while I don’t disagree 
with the idea of this being a 
protest piece I don’t want that 
to undermine the story because 
that’s why this installation was 
created: to share that story.”
In an interview with The 
Daily, Schultz explained he 
did not know Diede before he 
reached out to Schultz about the 
project. According to Schultz, 
the installation was entirely 
Diede’s idea — Schultz’s only 
involvement in the project was 
recording an already released 
statement.
Schultz said he hopes his 
recovery process shows that 
survivors can find hope after 
assault, as assault does not have 
to become one’s identity. 
“One of the things that I’ve 
had to find in my life is how to 
think of myself as more than 
someone 
who 
was 
gravely 
abused,” Schultz said. “And in 
finding meaning, in finding 
hope, in seeking kindness and 
empathy as guiding forces in 
my life, I have been on a journey 
of recovery that has allowed me 
to find beauty in life. What I 

hope from my statement, what 
I hope people takeaway is that 
there is an alternative to anger 
and bitterness as the lifelong 
choice in reacting to difficult 
circumstances.”
Reflecting 
on 
the 
installation’s theme of the abuse 
of power, Schultz expressed 
the importance of institutions 
recognizing individual dignity. 
“Leaders of institutions have 
an obligation to understand 
reputation and making money 
pale 
in 
comparison 
to 
an 
individual’s worth in terms 
of the dignity of the human 
soul,” 
Schultz 
said. 
“When 
institutions fail to recognize 
the dignity of those who are not 
in positions of power, they do a 
great disservice to the world at 
large.”
Music, Theatre & Dance Dean 
David Gier declined to comment 
on the installation, explaining 
he does not know the specifics 
of 
this 
class 
project. 
Gier 
redirected The Daily to Michael 
Gurevich, associate professor 
and chair of performing arts 
technology, for comment. 
Gurevich 
confirmed 
the 
installation is Diede’s final 
project for his interactive media 
design course. In an email to 
The Daily, Gurevich said he 
is proud of Fisher for tackling 
relevant student issues. 
“Interactive art installations 
act as mirrors, so I suppose these 
pieces are inevitable reflections 
of the climate these students 
are living in,” Gurevich wrote. 
“With ‘Pulling Strings,’ not only 
has Fisher brilliantly addressed 
the themes we address in the 
class and designed an elegant 
interactive system, he has also 
done an incredible amount of 
careful and diligent background 
work on the ethical and social 

considerations 
involved 
in 
creating a piece in a public 
space that addresses such a 
thorny topic. I’m proud of him 
for doing so.”
According 
to 
Diede, 
the 
installation was conceived in 
February as a project for class, 
though it ultimately expanded 
beyond the scope of the class. 
Diede 
explained 
he 
went 
through standard bureaucratic 
channels to clear his installation 
with Music, Theatre & Dance 
administration. In his design, 
Deide said he intentionally tried 
to make sure there would be no 
reason for the installation to 
be taken down or denied other 
than its subject matter. 
According 
to 
Deide, 
he 
pitched his project as a piece 
highlighting the power of large 
institutions and the sometimes 
unjust iterations of that power 
without mentioning it would 
be about Schultz and Daniels 
explicitly. Deide explained that 
while the piece was initially 
approved, 
it 
was 
suddenly 
placed on hold Monday evening 
when administrators learned it 
involved Schultz’s allegations 
against Daniels. However, it 
was reapproved within three or 
four hours of it being placed on 
hold, Deide said. 
Deide said he has received 
support for the project from 
several 
faculty 
members 
and 
students. 
However, 
he 
emphasized 
the 
pressure 
— from the music industry, 
the administration or legal 
proceedings 
— 
that 
many 
stakeholders feel not to speak 
publicly 
about 
allegations 
against Daniels.

E

very 
morning, 
after 
numerous unsuccessful 
attempts to throw off 
my covers and get up, I make 
myself a bowl of oatmeal, discard 
the trash and then start my day. 
What happens to the fate of my 
waste never even crosses my 
mind — it is the whole concept of 
out of sight, out of mind. In fact, 
I never really consider the final 
destination of any of the trash I 
produce. Except that trash does 
have to go somewhere. Early 
into my science, technology, 
engineering and math education 
I learned the law of conservation 
of mass, which posits mass 
cannot be created nor destroyed.
From food to toys, necessities 
to nonessentials, almost every 
product comes with its share of 
trash content. For this reason, 
on a typical day the average 
American citizen will produce 
4.40 pounds of trash. Of the 
trash produced, 2.91 pounds 
is waste as the other trash 
contents can either be recycled 
or composted. Multiply that by 
the 327,200,000 people you have 
living in the United States, and 
you are left with 476,076 tons of 
trash produced daily. With my 
elementary knowledge of science, 
I can ascertain that, though my 
trash is out of my hands, it is not 
off the planet. Additionally, with 
my rudimentary understanding 
of American infrastructure, I can 
assume my trash ends up lining 
a landfill somewhere on the 
outskirts of my community.
If you have ever been to one 
of these landfills, chances are 
you have seen the hundreds of 
birds that frequent the area and 
feast on the waste created from 
human consumption. Honestly, 
I never even thought about 
the implications of these birds 
until I read a study published by 
researchers at Duke University. 
The study shines a light on 
just how detrimental the birds 
may be to the environment. 
The reason why this is the 
case relates to a pretty juvenile 
concept 
that 
I 
learned 
in 
preschool: 
Everybody 
poops. 
Duke researchers estimated that 
over 1.4 million seagulls feed at 
landfills across North America, 
but Scott Winston, one of the lead 
researchers, believes “the actual 
population is probably greater 
than 5 million.” These birds 

consume our trash and evidently 
have to poop it out somewhere. 
This somewhere is not just the 
back of our brand-new shirt, 
but often bodies of water like 
lakes and rivers near our homes. 
Estimates from Duke say this 
trash ridden fecal matter deposits 
an additional 240 tons of nitrogen 
and 39 tons of phosphorus into 
our local waterways every year 
and as mentioned, the effects are 
drastic.
The 
added 
nutrients 
defecated 
into 
the 
lakes 
and 
rivers 
supplement 
eutrophication, which causes 
a dense growth of plant life, 
such as algae, limiting the 
oxygen 
contents 
needed 
to 
sustain 
healthy 
ecosystems 
and maintain aquatic life under 
the surface. This suppression 
of oxygen content to the life 
below the growth suffocates the 
animals and kills them as they 
do not have access to enough 
dissolved oxygen. The effects are 
ecologically and economically 
tragic as they degrade water 
supply and destroy aquaculture. 
This then means government 
money will be allocated to 
the problem, which results in 
financial losses. As the U.S. and 
global population continues to 
grow, these problems will likely 
only become exacerbated.
Therefore, 
change 
is 
pertinent, and solutions must 
be 
found 
to 
mitigate 
the 
transportation of these excess 
nutrients in our water. According 
to the study, researchers believe 
the best solution is to reduce 
the size of landfills, cover trash 
more quickly or reduce the gull 
population. 
However, 
these 
solutions feel temporary and I 
believe for long lasting impact 
we have to mimic nature. What 
I mean is that in the real world 
there is no landfill. Instead, 
materials 
are 
consistently 
reused. Additionally, as species 
die, their nutrients are given 
back to the Earth and create 
more life. Animals live in a 
closed-loop: 
Nothing 
seems 
to enter or leave the system, 
everything just cycles back. This 
cyclical model has sustained 
life for billions of years, yet 
the modern era of humans has 
instituted a linear lifestyle as we 
take, make and dispose.
Which poses the question: 

How do we disrupt this cycle 
and fight the problem at its core? 
From an early age I was told 
taught the three R’s as a way to 
solve this problem. My teachers 
encouraged me to reduce, reuse 
and recycle, but this solution 
just doesn’t cut it. As a capitalist 
society fueled by materialistic 
gain, reducing looks great on 
paper, but it is not a feasible 
solution. Since 1950 the average 
home size has almost tripled, 
making more room for material 
goods and in turn moving in the 
opposite direction of reductions 
and making for an “irresponsible 
American dream.” In terms of 
reusing, for that I prompt the 
question, when is the last time 
you actually recommissioned a 
product instead of donating it 
to the dump? Additionally, we 
are getting better at recycling, 
but 
with 
China’s 
ban 
on 
foreign waste recyclables, used 
products are forming stockpiles 
and going to waste before they 
are even repurposed. Moreover, 
when they are repurposed, it is 
typically only once before they 
eventually end up in a landfill.
This 
all 
prompts 
the 
question: What can we do to 
mitigate trash intake and in 
turn save the world? There is 
no simple answer or perfect 
solution. Humans are needy 
creatures who constantly take 
while leaving. The trash issue 
permeating America and beyond 
reminds me of a 1971 Pogo Earth 
Day comic strip from Walt Kelly. 
Porkypine says, “Ah, Pogo, the 
beauty of the forest primeval 
gets me in the heart.” Pogo 
responds, “It gets me in the 
feet, Porkypine.” Then, looking 
over a forest of trash Porkypine 
despairingly says, “It is hard 
walkin’ on this stuff” to which 
Pogo responds “Yep, son, we 
have met the enemy and he is 
us.” With no radical changes to 
our consumption or material 
habits, we will soon live in a 
world of trash and deal with 
the effects on humanity, the 
environment and every other 
facet of society imaginable. 
Trash does not leave the Earth 
— I know this from elementary 
school. But what if trash could 
never enter?

The parent trap: Asian edition
2

018 and 2019 have thus far 
been milestone years for 
Asian Americans in the 
entertainment industry. The 2018 
smash-hit “Crazy Rich Asians” 
was the first Hollywood movie 
since “The Joy Luck Club,” released 
over two decades ago, to feature all 
Asian American leads. The movie 
brought in more money than any 
rom-com released in the last nine 
years. Actress Sandra Oh won a 
Golden Globe for Best Actress in a 
Drama TV Series, making her the 
first actress of Asian descent to win 
for a leading role, or win multiple 
Globes, in nearly 40 years. Oh also 
hosted the event, using her platform 
to jokingly call out actress Emma 
Stone for her largely unquestioned 
white-washed role as an Asian 
American character in “Aloha.” 
When Awkwafina hosted Saturday 
Night Live in 2018, she was the first 
Asian American woman to do so 
since Lucy Liu in 2000; Sandra Oh 
hosted in March of this year.
Even outside of Hollywood, 
stars of Asian descent have risen 
to celebrity status in the United 
States. K-pop group BTS has made 
appearances on noteworthy shows 
such as Saturday Night Live, The 
Tonight Show, Jimmy Kimmel 
Live!, Ellen and more. They have 
also performed at the 2018 Billboard 
Music Awards, Dick Clark’s New 
Year’s Rockin’ Eve, as well as 
various other programs. They are 
scheduled to perform their new 
single “Boy with Luv” with Halsey 
at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards.
Another prominent K-pop group, 
BLACKPINK, appeared on Strahan 
and Sara, The Late Show with 
Stephen Colbert, Good Morning 
America and recently performed at 
Coachella.
While these trends suggest 
that American popular culture is 
becoming more welcoming toward 
people of color, there remains 
a trend among the treatment of 
Asian American celebrities on TV 
appearances that point towards 
an inability to see them as Asian 
Americans, rather than as Asians. 
Unlike white people or other 
people of color, Asian Americans, 
as well as people of Asian descent 
and of other nationalities such as 
Asian Canadians, are often asked 
about their parents. While Indian 
Canadians are of course subjected 
to a different set of social norms 
specific to Canada, all people of 
Asian descent tend to always be seen 
strictly as being only Asian, whether 
they’re Canadian, American, or of 
another nationality. Thus, while 
Americans and Canadians are the 
most prominent celebrities of Asian 
descent in American media, any 
person of Asian descent and of a 
non-Asian nationality would likely 
receive the same treatment were 
they to be thrust into the spotlight 
in American culture. While this 
may be unintentional on the 
parts of TV hosts, such questions 
are 
problematic 
because 
they 
demonstrate how public figures 
of Asian descent, even at the most 
successful they have ever been, are 
othered by American media.
Indian-American 
comedian 
Hasan Minhaj recently appeared 
on Ellen. At one point during his 
interview, Ellen mentioned that his 
parents, Seema and Najme, were in 
the audience before asking Hasan, 
“So, when did you start in stand-up 
and how supportive were they?” 
while briefly pointing to his parents. 
This question was most likely pre-
planned between Minhaj and Ellen, 
especially given that his parents 
were in the audience and Minhaj 
launched into a story following the 
question that he’s told before on the 

Deep Cuts segment of his Netflix 
show, Patriot Act.
However, Ellen also asked actor 
Steven Yeun, who is also Asian 
American, about his parents when 
he appeared on the show in 2014, 
commenting, “So your parents — 
then your parents were not happy 
that you chose this profession.” She 
asked him this after clarifying that 
he was born in Seoul, South Korea 
before moving to Saskatchewan and 
later to Michigan. Furthermore, 
when Sandra Oh first appeared on 
the Ellen Show in in 2007, Ellen 
started the interview by bringing 
up a photo of Oh and her parents at 
the Emmys, telling her, “They must 
be so proud.” Ellen then asked more 
questions about when Oh’s parents 
immigrated to Canada, before 
asking, “Were they proud like right 
away? They were like, ‘Go and be an 
actress.’”

Such 
interviews 
contrast 
harshly with when Ellen has spoken 
with celebrities not of Asian descent 
on her show, such as her interview 
with Zendaya, a Black actress. 
Rather than asking whether her 
parents supported her career, Ellen 
conversed with Zendaya about 
her relationship with her parents 
instead. At one point, Ellen asked, 
“how have you managed to stay out 
of the young-child-actor-going-bad 
thing?” Even though this would 
have made a natural segue to asking 
about Zendaya about her parents’ 
support (there were no such natural 
transitions when Ellen abruptly 
asked Minhaj, Yeun and Oh about 
their parents), she didn’t do so. In 
another interview with Allison 
Janney, a white actress, Ellen didn’t 
ask any questions about her parents 
support either, even though Janney 
brought them up in the interview 
while talking about the holidays.
Ellen’s need to ask only her 
guests of Asian descent about their 
parents’ support, even when doing 
so doesn’t fit in with the rest of 
the interview, shows that there 
still exists a clear divide between 
how celebrities of Asian descent 
and other celebrities are perceived 
in American media. Unlike other 
stars, celebrities of Asian descent 
are not acknowledged as having 
diverse 
backgrounds 
and 
are 
instead characterized by their 
Asian immigrant parents. This 
perpetuates 
the 
misconception 
that all people of Asian descent 
are homogeneous and reminds 
audiences that they have immigrant 
roots, which in turn implies 
that they belong in Asia, not the 
United States. Thus, when Ellen 
asks guests like Yeun and Oh 
about their parents’ support, she 
simultaneously reduces them to 
props to confirm American society’s 
stereotypes about people of Asian 
descent and puts their identities 
into question.
Even when they aren’t asked 
about their parents’ support or lack 
thereof, talk show hosts always 
seem to find a way to ask celebrities 
of Asian descent about their parents: 
Conan asked Yeun’s parents how 
they reacted to his love scenes on 
The Walking Dead, Jimmy Kimmel 
asked Asian Canadian comedian 

Lilly Singh about her parents after 
she appeared on his show and 
Jimmy Fallon asked Singh about 
her skits where she imitates her 
parents, rather than her numerous 
other segments.
Celebrities such as Yeun’s and 
Singh’s success in the United States 
is mostly unprecedented, since 
there have historically only been 
a few celebrities of Asian descent 
in American culture and even 
fewer who reach this same level of 
prominence. As a result, TV hosts 
struggle to reconcile the Asian 
parts of these celebrities’ identities 
with the American part. Because 
the only “Asian American story” 
they are familiar with is that of the 
immigrant, or child with immigrant 
parents, interviewers such as Ellen 
ask celebrities of Asian descent 
about 
their 
parents’ 
support, 
expecting them to explain that 
their immigrant parents were not 
supportive and then delve into their 
parents’ “immigrant story.” 
However, 
such 
questions 
also establish celebrities of Asian 
decent as “others,” whose roles 
in American society is to bolster 
the 
United 
States’ 
reputation 
as a country where anyone can 
succeed. Ellen wasn’t interested in 
Oh or Minhaj’s parents as actual 
people when she asked about them. 
She was interested in how they 
fulfill their stereotypical roles as 
immigrant tiger parents whose 
exterior eventually cracks when 
they see how the United States has 
allowed their children to succeed. 
Questions about parents ultimately 
undermine 
the 
American 
or 
Canadian part of these celebrities’ 
identities, and depict them as being 
only Asian.
This 
explains 
why 
such 
questions are limited to only 
celebrities 
of 
Asian 
descent 
who grew up in predominantly 
English 
speaking 
countries. 
Neither members of BTS nor 
BLACKPINK have been asked 
questions about their parents 
in any of their interviews in the 
United States. This is because their 
otherness is already established. 
They are Korean, not American, 
and they perform K-pop, which is 
decidedly not an American music 
genre. Thus, there’s no need for 
TV hosts to remind themselves or 
their guests of the artists’ roots in 
Asia, or attempt to reconcile any 
complex parts of their identities. 
They also may have no idea that 
BLACKPINK members Rosé and 
Lisa are Korean-Australian and 
Thai respectively, since it is likely 
that they assume all K-pop artists 
are Korean.
TV hosts need to stop asking 
celebrities of Asian descent about 
their parents. They need to stop 
expecting them to talk about 
their ethnicities and their own or 
parents’ stories as immigrants. 
Such stories are deeply personal, 
and while all of the celebrities 
mentioned in this article have 
seemed open to speaking about 
these topics, such questions often 
feel invasive and act in the same 
way that a huge, blaring, “You don’t 
belong here” sign would. There 
are more to these celebrities than 
their parents or their ethnicities, 
and while such parts of their story 
are important, they should not 
feel obligated to speak about their 
“immigrant backstories” because 
they are of Asian descent. There’s 
so much more to people of Asian 
descent than their ancestry, and 
it’s high time America recognizes 
that.

I 

rediscovered 
composer 
Johann Sebastian Bach’s 
cello suites this past fall 
during a period with lots of 
work and little motivation. I 
needed something to focus my 
mind on the tasks at hand. So, I 
turned to Bach to aid my quest 
for concentration. It ultimately 
worked, and soon his cello 
suites became a powerful study 
tool, allowing me to spend 
hours on work that seemed 
insurmountable before.
Viewing Bach as a study tool, 
not as sublime art, is a product 
of a culture that encourages 
us to spend much of our time 
in what I call Haze. Haze is 
marked by semi-consciousness 
usually for the purpose of work. 
It is the cousin of Flow (or 
being in “the zone”), a mental 
state characterized by clear, 
prolonged attention to a task. 
Flow arises naturally, usually 
when you are doing something 
challenging 
and 
rewarding. 
Haze is artificial and forced. 
And it’s the default mental state 
of our generation.
Our days are spent with 
earbuds in, never fully listening, 
but always with a companion 
muffling any thoughts we may 
have. Our social media addiction 
serves 
the 
same 
purpose. 
Scrolling, 
liking, 
refreshing, 
never just sitting and thinking. 
Work is mind-numbingly long, 
fueled by tools ranging from 
Bach to Adderall and adheres to 
the glorification of the “rise and 
grind” mentality.
We 
know 
we’re 
missing 
out 
on 
something. 
That’s 
why we practice 20 minutes 
of mindfulness every day — a 
window of clarity. But even 
that is labeled as “self-care,” an 
opportunity to “recharge” for 
the work ahead.
How did we get here?
As Anne Petersen explains 
in “How Millennials Became 

The 
Burnout 
Generation”, 
millennials (defined here as 
mostly white, largely middle 
class) were raised to expect that 
overachievement would lead to 
the good life. But that promise 
has not been kept. No longer is 
a college education the ticket 
to a stable job, and no longer is 
a stable job enough. That stable 
job also needs to be “cool” and 
something 
you’re 
passionate 
about. 
So, 
we 
optimize, 
constantly angling for The Job, 
racking up resumé stuffers as 
we go.
This 
culture 
is 
self-
reinforcing — as more people 
adopt it, others are forced to 
adopt in order to compete, 
and soon we’re stuck in place, 
but working harder than ever 
before. Companies are the main 
beneficiaries of this race to 
nowhere, reaping profits from a 
talent pool that does more and 
demands less.
To cope, we tell ourselves 
we love work, and that our 
work is meaningful. Companies 
have caught on, rebranding 
themselves with slogans that 
are versions of “making the 
world a better place.” Dropbox, 
a company that lets you upload 
files, says its purpose is to 
“unleash the world’s creative 
energy by designing a more 
enlightened way of working.” 
WeWork 
locations 
are 
monuments to hustle culture. 
Water coolers are branded with 
statements like “Don’t stop 
when you’re tired. Stop when 
you are done,” and neon signs 
urge you to “Do what you love” 
and “Hustle harder.”
It’s no coincidence that Haze 
is a contemporary affliction. 
In the age of Silicon Valley, 
there are no clear lines between 
work and play. Email and Slack 
ensure employees are always 
accessible, while technologies 
once 
reserved 
for 
social 

interactions are increasingly 
being used to create a personal 
brand. We show off our fun 
side on Snapchat, document 
our travels and interests on 
Instagram, 
get 
political 
on 
Twitter and perfect the humble 
brag on LinkedIn. Maintaining 
this brand takes time and 
energy, 
ensuring 
we 
are 
constantly performing, never 
simply doing.
This is a culture where 
as 
Anne 
Petersen 
puts 
it, 
“Everything that’s good is bad, 
everything that’s bad is good.” 
Everything that should feel 
good, like not working, feels 
bad, 
while 
everything 
that 
should feel bad, like working all 
the time, feels good.
So 
hobbies 
have 
become 
hustles. Pursuing something 
you merely enjoy has become 
pointless, 
even 
selfish. 
We 
should 
rather 
pursue 
what 
we’re good at, monetizing it or 
using it to help someone else. 
What leisure time we do have 
is dedicated to screens, because 
they are low commitment and 
Haze inducing.
Becoming 
aware 
of 
all 
this is comforting. It helps to 
explain some of my habits, 
making them not inevitable or 
intrinsic, but simply products of 
a common, but not inescapable 
environment. We can choose 
a different path. A path where 
Bach is art to be cherished, not 
a tool to be wielded. A path 
where self-reflection and Flow 
are the rule – not the exception. 
This reminds me of a quote 
from Mitch Albom’s memoir 
“Tuesdays 
with 
Morrie.” 
Albom’s 
beloved 
Professor 
Morrie advises that “you have 
to be strong enough to say if the 
culture doesn’t work, don’t buy 
it. Create your own.”

Thrusday, April 18, 2019 — 5

In the short span of three 
years, Sally Rooney has evolved 
from essayist to fiction writer 
to “the first great millennial 
novelist.” 
Sally 
Rooney 
got 
a New Yorker interview in 
January, told The Guardian 
that she “do(esn’t) respond to 
authority very well” and has a 
10-minute YouTube video on 
writing and Marxism. She’s 
a 
veritable 
cultural 
event, 
heralded 
for 
her 
bare prose, biting 
irony and slow burn 
of love in the time 
of late capitalism. 
Just 
check 
out 
what 
happens 
when you search 
#normalpeople on 
Instagram.
“Normal People” 
drops in the States 
on Tuesday, Apr. 16, 
and The Michigan 
Daily Book Review 
is 
celebrating 
by 
reviewing Rooney’s 
fiction 
career, 
last to first. Catch 
“Normal 
People” 
on 
the 
16th, 
“Conversations 
with Friends” on 
the 17th and “Mr 
Salary” on the 18th.
At 
a 
slim 
48 
pages, 
Rooney’s 
“Mr 
Salary” 
delivers 
a 
deliciously illicit and poignant 
love story. This is done in 
a fraction of the pages of 
her 
full-length 
novels 
like 
“Conversation with Friends” 
and “Normal People.”
In the story, Sukie returns 
home to Dublin from Boston to 
visit her dying father, Frank. 
She’s greeted at the airport 
by Nathan, her closest friend. 
Their interaction is heady with 
unfulfilled 
sexual 
tension. 
Sukie moved in with Nathan 
years ago after her mother 
died and her father lost all 
their savings to prescription 
drugs. Sukie was 19 at the time, 
finishing up her exams. Nathan 
was 34.

Due to the precarious nature 
of their relationship and the 
15-year age gap, there was 
nothing sordid about their 
time spent living together. 
Nathan 
even 
jokes 
about 
their living arrangement. He 
says, “I’m not really getting 
my money’s worth, am I?” 
Despite this, Sukie falls deeply 
and irrevocably in love with 
Nathan.
“My love for him felt so total 
and annihilating that it was 
often impossible for me to see 
him clearly at all,” Sukie said.

He was there for her when 
no one else was. Now, they’re 
on the edge of the inevitable.
As 
a 
Marxist, 
Rooney 
explores class tension through 
character 
relationships 
in 
“Conversation with Friends” 
and “Normal People.” The 
socio-economic stratification 
serves to magnify the power 
imbalance 
between 
her 
characters, 
adding 
another 
conflict to her already tension-
packed stories. Rooney doesn’t 
deviate 
from 
this 
theme 
in “Mr Salary,” weaving a 
deeply layered and complex 
relationship in under 50 pages.
“Mr Salary” has a simple 
plot, but it’s Rooney’s realistic 

writing and profound themes 
that elevate the book into 
a work of art. It’s not often 
that I find myself laughing 
and crying in the span of a 
single paragraph. It would’ve 
been easy for Nathan and 
Sukie’s relationship to fall into 
perversity, but it’s balanced 
by 
a 
fated 
tragedy. 
Their 
uncertain romance — will they 
or won’t they? — is framed with 
the pervasive atmosphere of 
death.
“Nothing inside my body 
was trying to kill me. Death 
was, 
of 
course, 
the most ordinary 
thing that could 
happen, at some 
level I knew that. 
Still, I had stood 
there waiting to 
see the body in the 
river, ignoring the 
real living bodies 
all around me, as if 
death was more of 
a miracle than life 
was,” Sukie said.
 Rooney’s “Mr 
Salary” is dense 
with 
metaphors, 
picturesque scenes 
and 
passages 
worthy 
of 
being 
mounted against a 
living-room 
wall. 
“Mr Salary” does 
more than touch 
on the intricacies 
of 
a 
forbidden 
relationship: 
It 
adds 
substance 
to 
innermost 
thoughts of new adult living 
in the 21st century. It’s easy 
to relate to “Mr Salary” as a 
junior in college, worrying 
about my future but still tightly 
holding on the optimism of my 
childhood.
Like “Conversations with 
Friends” and “Normal People,” 
Rooney leaves “Mr Salary” 
open-ended. There are elements 
of melancholy juxtaposed with 
sentimentality. 
Rooney, 
at 
just 27 years old, manages to 
masterfully convey these two 
sentiments. Weeks later, my 
thoughts still circulate back 
to this story as if Nathan and 
Sukie are my own friends. It’s 
the best short story I’ve read.

Rooney’s ‘Mr Salary’ is 
more than ordinary love

BOOK REVIEW: SALLY ROONEY WEEK

Mr Salary

Sally Rooney

Faber & Faber

Jan. 3, 2019

Patty Griffin is an unsung hero 
for blues, folk and soul music in the 
modern age. She’s run the gamut 
of every possible genre, picking 
up influences from jazz to classic 
folk and even, as she laughed at 
The Ark on Friday, characters like 
Screamin’ Jay Hawkins. Griffin is 
a tiny woman, her size countered 
by a cloud of strawberry blonde 
curls and a loud guffaw 
between songs. But the 
biggest thing about her, is, 
of course, her voice.
Last 
Friday 
night, 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
beloved 
folk 
venue 
sold 
out 
completely, 
audiences 
rushing to see Griffin 
in the intimate space of 
Main Street’s listening 
room. The songwriter has 
played at the Michigan 
Theater 
several 
times, 
but her appearance at 
The Ark marked a special 
opportunity for fans to join 
her in closer quarters, no 
more than 50 feet from the 
stage at the farthest seats. 
Opening for Griffin was 
Lucy Wainwright Roche, 
a fantastic songwriter in 
her own right and part of 
the famous Wainwright and Roche 
lineages of music. Wainwright 
Roche’s smooth voice and hilarious 
banter with the audience prepared 
them for a night of laughter and 
good music, and that they got.
As 
Wainwright 
Roche 
left 
the stage, all seated within the 
wooden walls of the venue buzzed 
in anticipation. It was a full house, 
saturated with excited new fans 
and longtime patrons of Griffin 
alike. Though the venue was filled 

with silver-haired listeners, there 
was also a surprising number of 
young members of the audience, a 
fact that proves Griffin’s universal 
appeal. She can do no wrong when 
it comes to live performance, 
given that her songs are often 
centered on the things we all have 
in common; grief, struggle, love. 
Through her raspy, soulful voice, 
Griffin has established a solid niche 
in the songwriting community, one 
that extends from her own projects 
into those of the Dixie Chicks and 

several other artists.
Griffin took the stage in a 
long black dress, her wild hair 
illuminated by the yellow stage 
lights in a sort of halo. She was 
joined by only a guitarist and 
drummer (who also played bass), 
incredible 
musicians 
in 
their 
own right. They both played 
piano during the performance at 
different times, handing guitars 
and tambourines across the stage 
in order to build Griffin’s clear voice 

into a woven landscape of sound. 
Just the three of them created an 
ambience that was equal parts 
intimate and perfectly produced. 
It seemed as if every wavering note 
in Griffin’s singing was put there 
on purpose, adding to the air of 
raw intensity that each of her songs 
evokes. She didn’t hit every high 
pitch, didn’t flip her voice around 
in acrobatics as most modern pop 
artists do, but in that restraint was 
Griffin’s power. By holding back 
at the right moments, the singer 
laid down a foundation of 
suspense that always broke 
at the right times, letting the 
floodgates open with sound at 
the right point during a bridge 
or chorus.
You could say that Griffin’s 
performance was careful in 
these ways, but it would be 
a lie. In her eyes throughout 
the night, the audience was 
well aware of a fire beneath 
the surface of Griffin’s petite 
frame, boiling out in her 
inimitable soul. No matter 
which song she sang, some 
from her new self-titled tenth 
album and some old favorites, 
this intensity laid comfortable 
underneath her voice. It’s the 
thing that strings all of her 
music together, despite the 
variety of genres and styles 
she chooses to adopt. In The 
Ark that night, this fire warmed 
the room easily, making each 
person sitting there feel a part of 
something bigger. If you have never 
listened to Griffin, it is a spiritual 
experience in the most simple of 
ways: She sings for the world, for 
all of us and none of us at the same 
time. Hearing someone’s soul come 
out of their mouth in beautiful 
harmony is an incredible thing 
to witness. And that is the thing 
Griffin is best at.

Patty Griffin brings her 
inimitable soul to The Ark

SHOW REVIEW

WIKIMEDIA COMMONS

I wish I would have taken 
a look at the poster for “The 
Public” before I decided to see 
it. If you haven’t seen the poster, 
try to recall “Love Actually’”s, 
swap in “The Public”’s cast, 
substitute a book stack for 
ribbon and you’ve got it. Can 
you see it? I hope so. This poster 
telegraphs all due warnings 
about the shortcomings of this 
film: It has more characters 
than it knows what to do with, it 
thinks passing references to the 

power of literature suffice and 
Emilio Estevez (“The Breakfast 
Club”) is in the middle of the 
confusion.
“The Public” has Estevez 
written all over it. He wrote, 
directed and starred in this 
confused tale of a librarian at 
the Cincinnati Public Library 
who, in an out-of-character 
move, 
takes 
a 
stand 
and 
occupies the library with its 
homeless patrons who have 
no other place to stay for the 
excruciating 
winter 
night. 
Unfortunately, Estevez strikes 
out on all three counts, and 
the movie that could have 

been a timely statement about 
the continued importance of 
activism and civil disobedience, 
of refusing to remain silent 
in the face of governmental 
neglect, is a dud. 
First, 
Estevez’s 
direction 
leads us nowhere compelling. 
At best, it’s as disorienting as 
his overwhelming number of 
characters and subplots. At 
worst, it’s laughable. Take, 
for example, his montages: 
He randomly inserts two in 
which people make various 
idiosyncratic requests at the 
library help desk, set to a 
nondescript, upbeat score that 

sounds like it might have been 
borrowed from iMovie.
His 
direction 
is 
nothing 
compared to his script, however. 
The dialogue is awkwardly 
expository, 
painfully 
stilted 
and often guilty of sapping even 
important, culturally relevant 
conversations 
of 
all 
their 
poignance.
Then comes his acting. Simply 
put, Estevez cannot 
bear the weight of this 
story. He delivers the 
stilted lines he wrote 
without any notable 
charisma. Librarians, 
notoriously 
underappreciated and 
mistaken 
for 
being 
uncool, 
are 
owed 
an apology, because 
Estevez 
convinces 
us 
of 
nothing 
but 
his 
uncoolness. 
Worse than that, his 
lack of charisma is 
contagious. It grieves 
me to say that even 
commanding “Wire” 
alumnus 
Michael 
K. 
Williams’s 
star 
dulls in scenes with 
Estevez. Same goes 
for 
Jenna 
Malone. 
The only one who 
seems 
immune 
to 
Estevez’s 
dullness 
is 
Taylor 
Schilling 
(“Orange Is the New 
Black”); her character, 
however, is written 
inexplicably into a relationship 
with Estevez’s character, so I 
suppose she falls victim to him 
in another way.

To 
top 
it 
all 
off, 
the 
film, 
overextended 
by 
its 
multiplicity of characters and 
incongruous 
subplots, 
ends 
up creating more ambiguities 
than anything else, many of 
which are just as troubling as 
they are puzzling. The most 
troubling of these ambiguities 
was 
Estevez’s 
treatment 
of 
mental illness. In a film like 

“The Public,” too confusing to 
be dark or pessimistic, comic 
relief was not a necessity, yet 
Estevez wove it in, often at the 

expense of homeless library 
patrons with mental illnesses. 
In 
fact, 
Che 
“Rhymefest” 
Smith’s character, Big George, 
operated exclusively as the 
butt of insensitive jokes about 
his delusion that his eyes 
having laser beams that kill 
people upon eye contact. The 
ambiguity 
surfaces 
when 
Estevez’s 
character 
gives 
George his glasses, 
claiming 
it 
will 
impede 
the 
laser 
beams. Does Estevez 
want to check off 
another 
box 
on 
his 
Christ 
figure 
checklist (feeding the 
hungry, 
sheltering 
the 
homeless 
and 
returning 
sight 
to 
the 
blind)? 
Does 
that make him an 
ally, 
after 
having 
manipulated George 
throughout the film, 
for humor’s sake or 
otherwise? 
Does 
Estevez even know 
what he wants?

I’m 
still 

wondering. 
For 
a 
challenging, complex 
debate about forms 
of activism, tune in 
to “On the Basis of 
Sex.” For a rallying 
cry in favor of civil 
disobedience 
and 
a blunt exposé of 
false allyship, watch 
(or read) “The Hate U Give.” 
Watch any number of films I’m 
missing, but don’t bother with 
“The Public.”

Estevez does not hit the 
mark with ‘The Public’

Last 
Thursday 
evening 
I went out to the Michigan 
Theater with some friends 
to 
see 
the 
19th 
annual 
M-agination 
film 
festival. 
After some quick hellos, we 
all took our seats and waited 
on the films to start. Having 
been aware of the production 
of several of these projects 
throughout the year, I was 
excited to see the results.
The first short film that 
came on was a James Bond 
parody entitled “Icebreaker,” 
written and directed by LSA 
junior and Daily Arts Writer 
Ian Harris and Engineering 
senior Charles Rivkin. The plot 
comprised of an evil genius 
business-frat dude trying to 
rid the world of icebreakers 
because he never knew what 
to say for his fun fact. The film 
relied heavily on poking fun at 
Greek life and privilege, among 
other University of Michigan 
memes. It would have marked 
a nice, light-hearted note to 
begin the festival on if many 
of the films to follow didn’t 
fall victim to the same trite 
nature.
Another short entitled “Cut 
Throat,” written and directed 
by LSA freshman Macy Goller, 
detailed the life of a chef who 
had never used a knife, only 
to discover that her finger, 
which she chopped off, was 
the secret ingredient to the 
ziti recipe her father had 
been looking for his whole 
life. Although it was clear 
from the start it wasn’t meant 
to be taken seriously, it was 
an attempt at exaggeratedly 
corny humor that could have 
been done by middle schoolers. 

Its nonsensical plot wasn’t 
compensated for by likability 
or humor.
Before I continue, I’ll make 
this clear: I’m in full support of 
M-agination’s mission. Giving 
students 
the 
equipment, 
advice and platform to realize 
an idea they never would have 
gotten to convey otherwise is 
an important aim. Plenty of us 
have ideas for films, scenes, 
lyrics or drawings in our 
iPhone’s notes that will never 
pan out. M-agination provides 
the 
opportunity 
for 
these 
seeds to blossom.
On Thursday night, though, 
I saw few flowers. The films 
mostly all shouted, “We were 
just having fun making this!” 
While they were intended 
for a wider audience, they 
only seemed to land for those 
in the audience who had 
participated in their making. 
I’m not putting down groups of 
friends who were just having 
fun doing something creative, 
but that shouldn’t have been 
the only objective here.
I know these were all shorts, 
but you should be able to say a 
lot more in a five minute short 
than you ever could in a five 
minute speech. A picture is 
worth a thousand words, so 
what’s a film worth with the 
added temporal dimensions 
of speech, music and an ever-
changing picture? A select 
few films followed the English 
class’s golden rule: “Show, 
don’t tell.”
One film that attempted to 
do so was “Detour,” written 
by Stamps sophomore Shira 
Baron and LSA sophomore 
Elizabeth Wilson. In it, two 
friends go on a road trip in 
which they run out of gas and 
are forced to take a detour to a 
gas station. This inconclusive 

plot serves as a metaphor for 
the lead character’s search for 
her sexuality, as all she knows 
for certain is that she’s not 
straight.
Another film that marked 
a slight improvement in the 
festival’s second half over the 
first was “What If?” written 
and directed by LSA sophomore 
Sophie Underwood. In it, a 
girl’s inner monologue plays a 
third character on a first date, 
constantly posing pessimistic 
“what if…?” questions until the 
girl finally asks herself, “so 
what if...?” and gains some self 
belief. Although the date itself 
isn’t convincing, the film’s 
message was more important 
than most.
Maybe the only film that 
kept me immersed throughout 
was 
“What 
is 
and 
What 
Should Never Be,” written 
and directed by LSA juniors 
Andrew Hullman and Colin 
Farmer. A band performs in 
a house of secret Carly Rae 
Jepsen admirers in an effort 
for one of the housemates 
to impress an indie girl. The 
clash that ensues between 
artsy boys and basic boys 
and “high” and “low” art is 
well-shot and paced, avoiding 
dwelling on moments of bad 
acting, scripting or set design 
that kept me constantly aware 
of the production of the other 
films.
Given 
that 
M-agination 
cuts most scripts it receives, 
these films probably lost their 
effectiveness at other points 
in the process. While having 
fun usually brings out the best 
in us, this kind of creativity 
was regrettably nowhere to 
be found on Thursday night. 
Ironically enough, the films at 
the M-agination Film Festival 
largely lacked imagination.

M-agination Film Festival 
is not that imaginative

Scott)’

SINGLE REVIEW: ‘CHOPSTIX (FT. TRAVIS 
SCOTT)’

First came a couple of 
ear-grating 
early 
demos 
featuring 
Kendrick 
Lamar 
that leaked last September. 
Then a delay from the slated 
April 4th release in light of 
Nipsey Hussle’s unfortunate 
passing. Finally, ScHoolboy 
Q’s 
“CHopstix,” 
featuring 
Travis Scott, dropped last 
Monday. The final version 
is easier on the ears than 
the leaks, but it’s already a 
candidate for 2019’s most 
disappointing singe.
With a producer as 
talented 
as 
DJ 
Dahi 
chopping up the beats 
(pun 
intended), 
a 
good 
track 
is 
almost 
guaranteed. But this beat 
is shockingly stale — a 
catchy sample is all it has 
going for it. It lacks the 
wacky 
creative 
drumwork 
staple to a Dahi beat (see 
Drake’s “Worst Behavior” or 
Logic’s “Never Enough”). In 
the current hip-hop landscape 
where just about every artist 
has 
top-notch 
production 
behind them, a lackluster beat 
murders all replayability.

Then there’s the case of 
the Travis Scott effect. When 
Scott sings a hook or verse 
for a song, it suddenly turns 
into a Travis Scott song, and 
the original artist becomes a 
guest on their own track. The 
rapper has taken many high-
profile victims: 2 Chainz on 

“4 AM,” Drake on “Portland” 
and Lil Wayne on “Let It Fly,” 
to name a few. It doesn’t have 
to do with the quality of a song 
— all of the aforementioned 
tracks are certified slappers. 
But the Travis Scott effect 
isn’t just in full swing on 
“CHopstix” — the hook is 

boring and sounds like a filler 
track that didn’t make the cut 
for Astroworld.
Lyrically there is nothing 
to say. ScHoolboy Q compares 
a girl’s legs to chopsticks. 
That’s it. No classic Q fire, no 
classic Q grit. Chopsticks are 
cool to use for a metaphor, but 
in the historical context 
of 
the 
West’s 
weird 
fetishization 
of 
Asian 
women 
as 
exotic, 
the 
comparison to a girl’s legs 
is vaguely off-putting. It’d 
probably slide as one line, 
but as the basis for the 
song, it’s a bit off-kilter.
After 
the 
absolute 
banger 
that 
was 
last 
month’s 
“Numb 
Numb 
Juice,” 
ScHoolboy 
Q 
set 
the 
bar 
high 
for 
his next single. All the 
momentum was in his hands. 
But “CHopstix” is Q dropping 
the baton. There’s no telling 
now if his upcoming album 
CrasH Talk will be golden or 
garbage.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

On Apr. 16, 2018, Kendrick Lamar’s 
DAMN. was named the winner of the 
2018 Pulitzer Prize for Music. This 
seemingly momentous choice sent 
shockwaves throughout the music 
world.
Up until 2018, the Pulitzer Prize for 
Music had been restricted to classical 
music. Though the prize is intended for 
a “distinguished musical composition 
by an American that has had its first 
performance or recording in the 
United States during the (previous) 
year,” it had previously been awarded 
exclusively to contemporary classical 
music composers and the occasional 
jazz composer. To many, it was the 
height of American “art music” — a 
guaranteed teaching position at a high-
paying university and a publishing deal 
with a major sheet music publisher.
Some would even argue that it 
has traditionally been restricted to 
the more well-established areas of 
contemporary classical music, all but 
avoiding Minimalism until the late 
1990s. It had only been awarded to 
three jazz composers prior to 2018, 
and never any composers of other 
“popular” forms of music.
But many assumed that the 2018 
prize spoke to a new era of the Pulitzer 
Prize for Music. Reactions around the 
music world varied, from the pride of 
the larger public for the newfound 
diversity of the prize to the fears of 
the contemporary classical music 
community at the loss of an important 
prize.
The reactions to the 2018 prize were 
divided, some in the contemporary 
classical music world mourning the 
(presumed) loss of this important 
prize while the larger American public 
applauded the diversification of this 
notoriously insular award.
And even within the contemporary 
classical music world, reactions to this 
decision were largely divided along 
generational lines, with many young 
composers (such as the year’s other 
finalists) celebrating Lamar’s win even 
as older generations feared the loss of 
this important award.
Personally, while I feared the 
effects that the loss of this award might 
have on contemporary classical music 
as a whole, I was also excited to see a 
prominent award confidently embrace 
other genres besides classical music. It 
spoke to the rapid integration of rap 
and hip-hop into the larger American 
cultural lexicon and the dissolving 
barriers between genres.
For the first time since the rise of 
the professional orchestra, it seemed 

as though the hierarchical boundary 
between “art music” and “popular 
music” had no effect on the jury 
as they considered the recipient of 
the award. This was not the first 
instance that the Pulitzer Prize had 
gone to a significant work of hip hop 
— that distinction belonged to Lin-
Manuel Miranda’s “Hamilton,” the 
winner of the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for 
Drama. But in this instance, Lamar’s 
DAMN. was considered alongside 
Michael Gilbertson’s string quartet 
“Quartet,” and Ted Hearne’s five-
movement cantata “Sound from the 
Bench.” His work of hip hop was 
considered against these two works 
of traditionally notated contemporary 
classical music and found to be the 
most musically compelling work of the 
year.
Nearly everyone seemed to assume 
that this marked a new era of the 
Pulitzer Prize for Music. Few seemed 
to think that the award could possibly 
return to the realm of contemporary 
classical music after this bold decision 
by the jury.
But on Monday, the 2019 prize 
was was awarded to Ellen Reid for 
“p r i s m,” a “bold new operatic work 
that uses sophisticated vocal writing 
and striking instrumental timbres to 
confront difficult subject matter: the 
effects of sexual and emotional abuse.” 
The other two finalists were also 
works of art music: James Romig’s 
solo piano work “Still” and Andrew 
Norman’s orchestral work “Sustain.”
Given the response that last year’s 
prize warranted, I assumed that this 
choice would be met with significant 
media attention. The award, after all, 
had been criticized last year for never 
having previously ventured outside 
of contemporary classical music. And 
yet few outside the contemporary 
classical music world seem to care 
about this year’s prize.
The coverage of this award in The 
New York Times is most telling in 
this regard. They ran an article on 
Apr. 11th about the 2018 award and 
the contemporary classical music 
community that was “upended” by 
this decision. But on Monday, when the 
award was announced, it warranted 
little more than a short feature in the 
classical music section of the paper.
The more that I have thought about 
this decision by the prize to return 
to contemporary classical music, the 
less that I have understood it. I had 
taken the previous year’s award to be 
indicative of where the award would 
move in the future. I assumed that 
the prize would continue to judge 
between all different types of music, 
not merely works of contemporary 
classical music.

The 2018 award, however, now 
seems a strange anomaly — a brief 
interruption, if you will — from the 
award’s consistent commitment to 
contemporary classical music. And in 
both the classical music world and the 
larger music-consuming public, this 
seems incredibly unsatisfactory.
In the classical music community, 
the decision to award Lamar the 
award sapped some of its career-
making power. It seems to no longer 
connote 
instantaneous 
academic 
success, and many have shifted their 
focus in this regard towards other 
American classical music awards.
And among the larger public, 
the reversion back to contemporary 
classical music undercuts much of 
the musical diversity that many took 
from Lamar’s win. Statements about 
the unexpected diversification of the 
“art music” and the collapse of musical 
hierarchy from 2018 seem cheap and 
disingenuous after the jury reinforced 
this hierarchy in 2019.
Last night, I texted a friend of mine 
for her thoughts. She’s a music major 
but she doesn’t study composition — 
while she was aware of Lamar’s win 
in 2018 she was unaware of this year’s 
winner.
When I texted her that Ellen Reid 
had won for “p r i s m,” she responded 
with something that caught me totally 
off guard. “A WOMAN,” she wrote.
While my friend was happy to 
see that the prize was awarded to a 
woman, the potential significance 
of this had not yet occurred to me. 
This award, after all, has already 
been awarded to seven other women. 
Though it was groundbreaking when 
Ellen Taaffe Zwilich won the prize 
in 1983, the past ten years have seen 
unexpected gender parity: five female 
recipients and five male recipients.
And though I may struggle to 
understand the jury’s decision to once 
again consider purely contemporary 
classical music for this award, I remain 
encouraged by gender parity that my 
friend identified. Classical music, after 
all, has proven notoriously resistant to 
widespread diversification efforts.
And in my personal struggle to 
come to grips with Lamar’s win, I had 
lost touch with the bigger picture. I 
had become so focused on the cultural 
implications of Lamar’s win that I 
failed to see the Pulitzer for what it is: 
a $15,000 prize awarded annually by 
a few randomly selected composers 
and performers. And in the greater 
music world, it matters little. It is 
the inclusion of new works to this 
homogeneous classical music canon, 
I now realize, that must be celebrated, 
whether they be works of hip-hop or 
works by female composers.

avier Simpson started 
with a cliché.
“It was tremendous,” 
the junior 
guard said. 
“I’m blessed 
to be a part of 
the season. A 
winning sea-
son. Definite-
ly extremely 
glad I was 
able to be in 
the position 
to help my 
team. Next 
year, hopefully we can make 
more noise. Get more success 
for the University, get more suc-
cess for next year, winning some 
championships.”
A little more than two weeks 
removed from a season-ending 
63-44 loss to Texas Tech in 
the Sweet Sixteen, that’s the 
answer Simpson is supposed to 
give. The season, of course, was 
great. The Wolverines won over 
30 games, set a program record 
with a 17-0 start and made it to 
the NCAA Tournament’s second 
weekend. Simpson, though, isn’t 
one to settle.
Do you feel like you guys hit 
your expectation for what you 
should’ve done?
He nearly cut off the question.
“No.”
What is that 
expectation?
“To win 
championships.”
There are few 
things that paint 
the picture of the 
program John 
Beilein has con-
structed better 
than the scene 
on Wednesday 
afternoon. Ignas 
Brazdeikis and 
Jordan Poole sat at round tables, 
dodging questions about their 
NBA fates to which, if internet 
rumors (and in the case of Braz-
deikis, his own words to ESPN) 
are to be believed, they already 

know the answers. Across 
the room, Charles Matthews 
laughed with his teammates, 
having avoided this ritual by 
announcing earlier in the day 
that he would keep his name in 
the draft.
Michigan didn’t meet expec-
tations this year, and it will like-
ly see a good amount of attrition 
during the offseason. But when 
30 wins and the Sweet Sixteen 
is considered a disappointment, 
when attrition comes with play-
ers leaving for the NBA, when 
the NCAA Tournament is still 
an expectation in a rebuilding 
year — that means the program 
is exactly where it wants to be.
Beilein remembers the first 
time he made a Sweet Sixteen 
here, back in 2013. One of the 
Detroit papers, he’s not sure 
which, ran a big, celebratory 
headline. It had been 19 years 
since the Wolverines made it 
that far.
In the six years since, they’ve 
done so four times. And made 
the national title game twice. 
During his tenure, Beilein has 
gotten nine guys drafted. It’s 
now a reason people come to 
Michigan.
“Growing up, you want to play 
in the NBA. That’s your entire 
goal,” Poole said. “Being able to 
see guys coming through Michi-
gan, make it into 
the NBA and the 
record that they 
have, it’s just 
— it’s a record 
that’s just like, 
it’s crazy. I don’t 
know how you 
wouldn’t be able 
to look at it.”
Poole, age 19, 
does not remem-
ber watching 
Michigan bas-
ketball before it was anything 
but this. He remembers Trey 
Burke’s shot, when he was in 
eighth grade. He doesn’t remem-
ber Tommy Amaker. He doesn’t 
remember NCAA sanctions or 

tournament droughts.
When Beilein got here, the 
kindest thing you could say 
about Michigan’s basketball 
reputation was that it didn’t 
have one, and really, you could 
say a lot worse 
than that.
“Growing 
up in Indiana, 
I knew the Fab 
Five and, obvi-
ously, knew like 
(Robert) Trac-
tor Traylor and 
those guys,” 
Zack Novak, a 
Michigan guard 
from 2008-12, 
said in a phone 
interview last week. “And then 
there was kind of a big gap for a 
while.”
Novak was part of Beilein’s 
second recruiting class in Ann 
Arbor. He came in after a 10-22 

season in which the Wolverines 
finished ninth in the Big Ten, 
and Beilein recruited him to 
play in a two-guard offense and 
a 1-3-1 defense.
“You bring in me, Stu (Dou-
glass) and Ben 
Cronin,” Novak 
said. “So expec-
tations — I do not 
believe that any-
body realistically 
expected us to 
get to the NCAA 
Tournament that 
year.”
Michigan did 
break its tourna-
ment drought 
that year, and 
a decade later, outside a locker 
room in Anaheim with disap-
pointment cascading, Novak was 
standing there in maize and blue 
gear, talking of just how much 
things have changed, a walking 

beacon of perspective.
Back then, nobody on the 
Wolverines’ roster had been to 
the Tournament. Now, freshmen 
come in with the expectation of 
not just playing in March, but 
getting far. And in more than a 
few cases, getting to the NBA 
after that.
Beilein got Michigan back 
there with a two-guard offense 
and a zone defense. Now, under 
a coach caricatured as stub-
born and unyielding, Michi-
gan competes for titles with a 
ball-screen offense and a man-
to-man defense that KenPom 
ranked second in the country 
last season.
“There’s a whole bunch 
of stuff that we’re not gonna 
change, and that’s probably the 
hardest thing,” Beilein said. “But 
it’s the things that are basic to 
winning basketball games. Hav-
ing high character kids. Having 

kids that fit Michigan. Trying to 
get skilled players who all can 
shoot as much as you can. And 
kids that just would fit right in 
and want to be here. Right?
“That’s never gonna change. 
But style of play and things like 
that is always changing.”
When Beilein recruited a 
decade ago, he talked of getting 
back to the Tournament. But 
there was another layer on top.
“He was very firm that 
Michigan should be a premier 
program,” Novak said, “and we 
needed to build the foundation 
to get back to where it should 
be.”
When a season like this one 
can be considered disappoint-
ing, that’s exactly where Michi-
gan is.

A disappointing season, and a plan fulfilled

MAX KUANG/Daily
Michigan coach John Beilein has created a culture of consistent winning, leading to high expectations every year regardless of player experience and talent.

But style of play 
and things like 
that is always 
changing.

There’s a whole 
bunch of stuff 
that we’re not 
gonna change.

It’s time for Jeter to make the leap

With 
Donovan 
Jeter, 
it’s 
never been a question of talent.
Jeter came to Michigan a 
lauded 
four-star 
defensive 
lineman recruit from Beaver 
Falls, Pa. He had offers aplenty 
— Notre Dame, Alabama, Ohio 
State, Penn State, you name 
it. Like any other high-end 
Division-I talent, he’d never sat 
on the bench or had to wait his 
turn, and maybe that was all 
part of the problem.
“We’re going to be crazy when 
we get there,” Jeter, smirking, 
told a reporter from 247Sports 
during his senior year of high 
school. “We’re going to need 
that first year to get settled in, 
but that sophomore year, we’re 
going to be crazy out there.”
Since then, hardly anything 
has gone as planned. Jeter 
promptly tore his meniscus in 
the latter part of his freshman 
fall camp. He missed the entire 
season, and that sophomore 
season 
he 
intended 
to 
be 
“crazy” became, ostensibly, his 
freshman season. The learning 
curve was steep. Playing time 
was minimal.
Now Jeter, with three career 
tackles to his name, will enter 
fall camp as one of the most 
important 
players 
on 
the 
Wolverines’ defense — fairly or 
otherwise — facing a season that 
will make or break his trajectory, 
on a team that desperately needs 
the former.
“After not playing for a year 
— coming out of high school, I 
get injured and not playing for a 
year — then I come and basically 
just sat the bench,” Jeter said 
after Saturday’s Spring Game. 
“I’m not used to that, so I 
couldn’t just sit there and be 
OK with ‘Ah, I can be a backup.’ 
Nah, I got to try to be the best 
player I can be.”
Jeter has spent this spring 
doing his best to follow through 
on 
that 
commitment. 
He’s 
focused on honing his technique, 
trying to incrementally improve 
each 
day, 
slowly 
ascending 
toward the player he wants 
to be. Michigan coach Jim 

Harbaugh said he “appears 
hellbent on being the starting 
defensive tackle.”
“Donovan 
Jeter 
is 
really 
special,” added senior defensive 
end Josh Uche. “I’ve known it. 
Me and him, we’ve gone through 
stuff. We’ll talk to each other, 
pick each other up and he’s just 
special, man. He’s picked it up 
so much this spring and I’m so 
proud of him. I can’t wait til you 
guys see what he’s 
done this spring.”
For a team that 
lost 
Lawrence 
Marshall, 
Bryan 
Mone and Aubrey 
Solomon along the 
interior, 
there’s 
little 
alternative 
at the moment. 
Senior 
Michael 
Dwumfour 
remains sidelined 
for an undisclosed amount of 
time with an injury. On the 
razor-thin depth chart, Jeter 
and senior Carlo Kemp pack 
the bulk of experience, with 
true freshman Mazi Smith and 
converted fullback Ben Mason 
being relied upon behind them.
Jeter will get his opportunity, 
whether he’s ready or not.
When Jeter speaks, he does so 
with firm conviction. It’s clear 
he carries the bumps and bruises 
of the last two years with him, 
and that they’ve calloused into 
determination. There’s a clear 
understanding that he knows 
this is the year for him.
“I think it’s a mindset. I just 
changed my mindset,” he said. 
“I told myself, ‘I’m going to be 
dominant and I’m going to be 

physical.’
“I’ve always had power, I’ve 
always been strong. I’m still 
working on a lot of things, every 
day I’d tell myself, ‘I’ve got to get 
better at something.’ Whether 
it’s my hands, or my feet, or how 
I play a certain block, or how I 
read the back, there’s certain 
things I had to do.”
Spring hype tends to generate 
as a result of surprise, necessity 
or 
some 
combination of 
the two. Real 
competition is 
the only thing 
that will unveil 
where 
Jeter 
falls 
along 
that spectrum; 
whether 
his 
hype 
was 
simply 
borne 
of a necessity 
for interior defensive linemen 
or whether this is truly his 
breakthrough moment.
“Yeah, I’m ready to be a big-
time player,” Jeter said. “I’ve 
been working like it. I have to 
fine-tune some things still. Like 
I said earlier, there are still so 
many things I want to work in 
my game. I think I have what I 
need to. Now it’s about putting 
the work in and really just 
executing and really tweaking 
those little things.”
Four 
months 
out, 
he 
is 
controlling what he can — 
mentally, 
technically 
and 
intellectually. 
The 
rest, 
he 
believes, will take care of itself.
Because with Donovan Jeter, 
it’s never been a question of 
talent.

‘M’ defeats Bowling Green, 10-5

As the rain began to fall and the 
weather grew colder, Michigan’s 
bats got hotter.
Despite 
some 
fielding 
difficulties which created an early 
deficit, the Michigan baseball 
team pulled itself together in 
the second half of the game 
Wednesday 
evening 
to 
best 
Bowling Green State, 10-5.
After a disappointing weekend 
in Columbus which saw the 
Wolverines lose two of their 
three games against Ohio State, 
Wednesday’s win kicked off a 
seven-game 
homestand 
that 
offers a chance to regroup while 
there is still time left in the season.
In the early innings, Bowling 
Green 
leveraged 
repeated 
misses 
from 
the 
Wolverines 
in the outfield to get on base. 
Base hit after base hit from the 
Falcons sent Michigan’s outfield 
scrambling and notched Bowling 
Green an early lead.
A two-run homer from senior 
infielder Jimmy Kerr in the second 
inning put Michigan in front, 2-1. 
A number of clutch plays ensured 
Bowling Green couldn’t gain too 
much of a foothold.
“They kept it a tight game 
early,” said Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich. “But I thought we at 
least had some huge defensive 
plays early in the game to prevent 
additional runs from being scored 
and falling further behind.”
The sixth inning finally brought 
success and saw the Wolverines 
start to pull away after they 
suffered three scoreless innings, 
during which Bowling Green took 
a 3-2 lead. With the bases loaded 
and still no outs, sophomore 
shortstop Jack Blomgren started 
the scoring with a double to left-
center field that sent seniors Blake 
Nelson and Miles Lewis home 
to regain the lead. A sacrifice fly 
from senior infielder Matthew 
Schmidt, who started Wednesday 
for the first time, subsequently 
sent Kerr home to bring the score 
to 5-3.
The Falcons were stumped in 
drawing many outs. Michigan 
fully rotated through its lineup 
and got only one out in the process. 

Two more runs from Blomgren 
and sophomore catcher Harrison 
Salter came before the end of the 
inning, making it 7-3.
“The sixth inning was the 
difference tonight,” Bakich said 
“With five of those at-bats going 
to two strikes, the guys were 
battling.”
Bowling 
Green’s 
difficulty 
in stopping Michigan’s batters 
became a theme as it eventually 
cycled through 
a total of nine 
pitchers 
by 
the end of the 
game.
But 
its 
offense 
had 
an 
answer. 
Redshirt junior 
left-hander 
Benjamin 
Keizer 
tried 
to 
pitch 
the 
Wolverines out of a jam after 
Bowling Green loaded its bases in 
the top of the seventh. Michigan 
managed to preserve its lead but 
conceded another two runs to 
the Falcons. Another foreboding 
inning was brought to an end by a 
fielder’s choice to second.

Michigan seemed poised to 
deliver another set of runs as 
it stepped up to the plate, but 
lightning was soon spotted over 
the Big House and the game was 
delayed for over an hour until the 
storm passed.
An hour of sitting in the locker 
room seemed to put no damper 
on the Wolverines’ offensive 
momentum, as they put up a three-
run seventh inning highlighted by 
a soaring double 
through the gap 
from 
sophomore 
designated 
hitter 
Jordan Nwogu.
“To come out 
after the delay and 
put up a three-spot 
was huge,” Bakich 
said. “It was big 
time 
insurance 
because 
Bowling 
Green 
doesn’t 
quit.”
The 
pitching 
and 
defense 
seemed reinvigorated after its 
break as well and kept Bowling 
Green scoreless through the end 
of the game. Over five hours later, 
the Wolverines walked away with 
a 10-5 win.

From Fleet Feet to Michigan: The Fenty family and a culture of exercise

Phil 
Fenty 
runs. 
He 
bikes. He swims. Fenty runs 
ultramarathons 
— 
100-mile 
races that can take nearly 24 
hours to compete.
“What’s even more crazy is 
that he did them twice,” said 
Andrew Fenty, his grandson. 
“And to qualify for that event 
you have to run numerous 50 
mile events.”
Phil Fenty runs Ironman 
races, 
even 
the 
Ironman 
World Championship — the 
most 
grueling 
of 
triathlon 
competitions. 
He 
races 
in 
all these competitions as a 
septuagenarian.
“He 
does 
everything,” 
Andrew said.
Adrian Fenty, Phil’s son and 
Andrew’s father, runs every 
morning often at 5 a.m.
Shawn 
Fenty, 
Adrian’s 
brother and Phil’s son owns 
Fleet Feet in Washington D.C., 
arguably the nation’s premier 
running 
store. 
He 
outfits 
hundreds of runners who travel 
to his store in search of the ideal 
fit for a long run, much like the 
ultramarathons Phil competes 
in.
And Andrew?
Andrew plays tennis. The 
freshman anchors the Michigan 
men’s tennis team, finishing 
with 22 singles and 18 doubles 
wins — both the highest totals 
on the Wolverines this season.
Fenty and his twin brother 
Matthew had a lot of energy 
as young children. Adrian, the 
boys’ father and the mayor of 
Washington D.C., decided to 
introduce sports as a way to 
channel this enthusiasm into 
something constructive. Then, 
from a friend who went to high 
school with Adrian and lived 
nearby, Adrian found tennis 
and signed the boys up. When 
they were three or four years 
old, he took his children to a 
tennis academy owned by his 
friend.
“He would let them hit even 
when they weren’t ready for 
it,” Adrian said via a phone 
interview. “So by the time they 
were four, they actually could 
hit pretty well and do practices.
“They played a lot of other 
sports for a while, but tennis 
was always the sport and by the 
time they were 12, it was the 
only sport.”
And 
as 
Andrew 
would 
eventually learn, tennis became 
his sport. Just like track for 
his father, marathoning for his 
grandfather and cycling for his 
uncle.
The passion for athletics and 
fitness began with Phil, when he 
was in his thirties and wanted 
to keep up with his sons and lose 
weight, according to Adrian. So, 

Phil decided to take up running. 
It was inexpensive and required 
minimal equipment, just a pair 
of running shoes. But as he 
continued to pursue it, running 
became more than just a means 
to lose weight. Running slowly 
became Phil’s passion, a method 
of solace.
“I just enjoyed running,” 
Phil said. “It was something 
that appealed to me and came 
naturally to me. I had an affinity 
to it. It quieted my mind. When 
you’re running you’re just with 
yourself, a meditative type of 
adventure.”
Though it certainly provided 
benefits for his health, Phil also 
greatly appreciated the familial 
attitude 
that 
came 
from 
running. It was a sport that Phil, 
his wife and two sons could do 
together and separately. And, 
Phil believes that it led Shawn 
to pursue cycling and Adrian to 
pursue soccer.
But rather than just maintain 
this affinity as a casual hobby, 
or a way to keep his family 
connected, 
Phil 
turned 
his 
passion into a business.
Phil had experience working 
in retail and had received 
significant experience as an 
employee for Sears Roebuck. 
Opening his own store was 
something he envisioned doing, 
and 
combining 
his 
passion 
for exercise with his retail 
experience made it an easy 
decision.
Then, he met the founder of 
Fleet Feet.
“She lived in California, and 
had 18 stores in California,” Phil 
remembers. 
“Coincidentally, 
at the same time she was 
interested in opening stores 
outside 
of 
California, 
and 
Washington D.C. was a good 
spot because we had a great base 
of runners and things going 
on in D.C. And so she granted 
my wife (Jeannette) and I a 
franchise, and we opened it and 
so my dream came true and it 
worked out very well.”
Phil is being modest.
35 years later, Fleet Feet is 
the premier running shop in 
the Washington D.C. area and 
remains a family business. What 
began as a store owned by Phil 
and his wife is now currently 
managed by Phil’s son, Shawn 
with many members of the 
family working there.
It began as a store focused on 
triathletes but now, it focuses 
on a specific niche — intense 
runners.
When Andrew was asked 
about his experiences with 
Fleet 
Feet, 
he 
smiled 
and 
remembers working at a store 
with his cousins and uncles. As 
a young child, he would be with 
the employees at a nearby park, 
spending time with them on 
their breaks.

“I remember as a young kid, 
my father would just leave me 
(at the store),” Andrew said. 
“Recently, I worked there as 
a salesman, which was weird, 
because I grew up there my 
whole life.
“It’s 
a 
rite 
of 
passage, 
everyone goes through there.”
Added Phil: “Andrew and his 
brother Matthew, they’re twins, 
they spent days in the store 
when they were still in baby 
carriers. They’ve been at the 
store since they were born, as 
have all the children. It’s been a 
great family environment.”
Working at Fleet Feet is 
seemingly only one of many 
“rites of passage” for the Fenty 
family. Another is finding your 
sport.
But, it was up to each member 
of the family to find their own 
athletic 
niche. 
Phil 
never 
sought to steer his children 
or his grandchildren to any 
specific sport.
“Shawn and (Adrian) are 
both athletes in their own 
disciplines,” Phil Fenty said. 
“It was never pressure to be a 
runner, (it was) to find the sport 
that works for you and put in a 
good effort.
“Tennis was their thing. I 
didn’t try to influence anybody 
in the family to do what I did. 
They found the sports that 
worked for them.”
Phil, though, still recognizes 
the 
benefits 
that 
running 
provided for Andrew at a young 
age. He believes that endurance 
is crucial to success in tennis 
and that those with running 
backgrounds have a significant 
advantage. 
Andrew certainly recognizes 
the effect that such training 
provided. About five years ago 
on Christmas, Andrew began 
doing a track workout with 
his father. Even in that first 
workout, Andrew kept pace 
with a father who avidly runs 
triathlons 
and 
marathons, 
Adrian noticed his son’s speed 
and potential.
By the next year, Adrian 
acknowledges that his son had 
bested him. And for Andrew, 
these workouts and lessons from 
his father and grandfather have 
paid dividends on the court. 
It has given him perspective 
on his up-and-coming tennis 
career.
“(My grandfather) still works 
out four hours a day,” Andrew 
said. “He goes to the gym as 
much as me. He doesn’t stop. It’s 
motivation, but it’s just amazing 
to see that, he’s kinda like my 
father in a way, never stopping. 
I don’t think he knows what it 
feels like to not work out.
“It means the world, to 
have the grandfather like that, 
pushing me in a way.”
Andrew’s father too, provided 

a path for his son to succeed.
Adrian Fenty had a similar 
journey to intense distance 
running 
as 
Phil. 
After 
graduating from Oberlin and 
competing on the track team for 
two years, Adrian took a break 
from the sport for most of his 
twenties.
It wasn’t until his thirties 
— as happened with his father 
— that Adrian returned to the 
sport. Running, in the words of 
Adrian appears “in his blood” 
and he couldn’t stay away.
But for Adrian, it’s not just a 
way to stay in shape or keep his 
heart rate up. He genuinely — 
which, as Adrian acknowledges, 
is perhaps a bit peculiar for 
many to understand — loves 
running.
“Even if there was a way 
to 
magically 
make 
myself 
permanently in good shape 
without running, I still would 
want to run,” Adrian said. “I 
enjoy it that much. I would 
definitely miss it if I didn’t do it 
regularly.”
Adrian remained true to 
his word. As the mayor of 
Washington D.C. for four years 
from 
2007-2011, 
he 
would 
wake up in the early mornings 
before work and run. He credits 
endurance as a valuable tool not 
only for running, but for various 
facets of life.
“If you are good at endurance 
sports, you can wear down 
the competition,” Adrian said. 
“That’s the theory and the hope. 
Whatever 
the 
competition 
happens to be. Whether it’s in 
business, politics, academics or 
sport. Hopefully you’ll outlast 
everybody.”
Adrian never wanted his twin 
sons to participate in track and 
field, believing it to be a “burn-
out sport.” He did though, hope 
the two would find the same 
sport and stick with it.
Tennis 
happened 
to 
be 
that sport. They could play 

— 
and 
enjoyed 
— 
football 
and 
basketball 
but 
by 
the 
time Andrew and his brother 
Matthew were eight years old, 
they could succeed at tennis 
together.
And as with Phil Fenty 
and his sons, tennis became a 
family affair for Adrian and his 
twin sons and daughter Aerin, 
born in 2008. It became a sport 
that the five of them enjoyed 
and relished both playing and 
watching.
For Andrew, that led him to 
compete for Michigan.
***
No one ever pushed Andrew 
to play tennis. “Tennis was 
always my thing,” he said. While 
his 
father 
and 
grandfather 
would passionately run miles 
on end, Andrew was drawn to 
the tennis court, specifically 
the hard court.
He loves the speed of the 
game of the tennis and, on hard 
courts, the speed of the ball.
But Andrew recognizes the 
power that running so often 
as a child provided him. He 
understands the benefits it gave 
him to succeed in tennis. It also 
put the sport in perspective for 
him, something tangible that he 
reflects on during matches.
“It shows me that whatever 
I do, playing tennis for three 
or four hours going side to 
side, is nothing,” Andrew said. 
“It’s nothing at all. What these 
guys do is just run. The only 
way to get better at running, is 
running. It’s more mental than 
anything.
“When I’m out there, I think I 
can do this, I do it all the time. I 
can run longer, I can run faster. 
That’s what I tell myself.”
He has succeeded. He leads 
the Michigan tennis team in 
victories this season and is 
expected to lead the Wolverines 
this weekend when they begin 
the Big Ten Tournament.
Fleet 
Feet 
too, 
provided 

invaluable lessons for Andrew. 
According to Phil, the right 
tennis shoe is crucial to success 
and it is vital to take care of 
one’s feet in tennis when the 
player moves from side-to-side 
for multiple hours.
His grandfather also taught 
him the importance of the 
mental aspect in tennis. The role 
of working with his teammates 
and coaches to achieve their 
best goal.
Most significantly though, 
the Fenty family fostered a 
goal of exercise and sport. They 
honed it with the establishment 
of the Washington D.C. Fleet 
Feet in 1984. Each member has 
spent time as a sales associate 
or in other capacities working 
at the store.
Phil Fenty honed it through 
running miles and miles and 
fitting the customers of his 
store with the proper footwear. 
And, serving as counsel to his 
sons and grandchildren in their 
sporting exploits.
Adrian 
Fenty 
honed 
it 
through his morning runs, his 
desire to run no matter where 
he is or what he’s doing. All that 
matters is that he has his shorts, 
shirt and watch.
And finally, Andrew Fenty 
took the lessons of all those 
in his family. He took the 
lessons 
from 
Fleet 
Feet, 
morning runs with his father 
and conversations with his 
grandfather to succeed as a 
freshman for Michigan tennis.
Being an athlete is simply in 
his blood.
“In our family generally, 
everybody’s an athlete,” Phil 
said. “Male and female. Young 
and old. All of us. Everybody 
runs, bikes and swims. It’s 
our family’s activity. When we 
travel, when we go anywhere, 
we make sure we have facilities 
where we can exercise.
“It’s always been in our DNA 
to exercise.”
