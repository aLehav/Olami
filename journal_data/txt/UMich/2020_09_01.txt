Nicholas 
Prada, 
a 
former 

employee at Tomukun Noodle 
Bar on East Liberty Street, filed a 
suit in a U.S. district court Friday 
claiming he was wrongfully 
terminated 
after 
contracting 

COVID-19 in late June. According 
to the lawsuit, Prada and his 
attorney, Noah Hurwitz, allege 
that Tomukun’s actions violate 
numerous federal acts, including 
the Families First Coronavirus 
Response Act and Family Medical 
Leave Act.

In an email to The Daily, 

Hurwitz said employers should 
not retaliate against employees 
in order to protect their public 
image. 
Instead, 
they 
should 

act 
with 
compassion 
and 

understanding 
for 
employees 

who may get sick, Hurwitz said.

“It appears that Tomukun 

lost sight of its legal obligations 
to employees and punished my 
client for contracting COVID-19 
when it wouldn’t put him back on 
the schedule after he recovered,” 
Hurwitz wrote. “While we are 
all tasked with being responsible 
and doing our best to avoid spread 
of the virus, businesses should 
not attempt to pass judgment on 
employees who fall ill.” 

University 
of 
Michigan 

faculty members are considering 
a vote of no confidence in the 
administration 
due 
to 
the 

University’s 
response 
to 
the 

COVID-19 pandemic and fall 
reopening plan, faculty members 
said at an emergency Faculty 
Senate meeting Friday.

The meeting came a few days 

after a July 31 memo to University 
President Mark Schlissel from 
the President’s Advisory COVID-
19 Committee on Ethics and 
Privacy was inadvertently made 
public and began circulating 
online, sparking criticism toward 
University administration. The 
memo explicitly warned against 
the University’s reopening plan, 
and noted that the current plan 
would hit vulnerable populations 
the hardest.

A 
successful 
vote 
of 
no 

confidence 
would 
mean 
the 

Faculty Senate no longer believes 
in University leadership’s ability 
to execute its role, which in this 
case applies to the University’s 
fall reopening plan, according to 
a copy of the motion obtained by 
The Daily.

The virtual emergency meeting 

was held in response to an Aug. 
23 petition signed by more than 
200 University faculty members. 
All faculty hold membership in 
the senate. Faculty expressed 
frustration at the meeting over 
the University’s plans for the fall 
semester, which begins Monday. 

According to Faculty Senate 

Rule 4(1), a meeting can be 
organized by means of a petition 
signed by 50 or more Senate 
members. The Faculty Senate 
Office told The Daily that they 
believe this is the first time such a 
meeting has been called since the 
rule was established in 2011.

Sworn or armed police officers 

will not walk and ride around 
campus 
to 
regulate 
student 

behavior 
in 
an 
“adjusted” 

Michigan 
Ambassadors 

program, 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan confirmed on Twitter 

Sunday afternoon. The change 
came in response to “community 
concerns,” 
according 
to 
the 

announcement.

The 
University’s 
initiative 

to 
enforce 
COVID-19-related 

regulations still includes some 
law enforcement involvement. 
The ambassadors are still not 
expected to “directly engage 

with large parties or situations 
where their personal safety may 
be at risk.” Addresses reported 
for repeat violations will be also 
dealt with by police, according 
to updated information on the 
University’s COVID-19 website. 

“As was the case prior to the 

Ambassador 
program, 
sworn 

officers from UMPD and AAPD 

will still respond to emergency 
calls or other situations not 
appropriate 
for 
Ambassador 

involvement,” the website reads.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

After almost six months of no 

physical paper, The Michigan 
Daily will be printing once a week 
this fall on Wednesdays as long as 
students are living on campus.

In March, The Daily pivoted 

with the rest of the world to battle 
a global pandemic. We halted 
our print edition after March 
13 as students fled campus, but 
we doubled down on our online 
presence and saw a growing 
digital audience. We worked hard 
to bring the University and Ann 
Arbor communities the news over 
the summer, too. 

The University has brought 

students back to campus for 

an in-residence fall semester. 
However, COVID-19 is still very 
much a threat. Most classes 
are being offered remotely and 
University buildings will be at 
reduced capacity to allow for 
social distancing. 

Due to less campus and city 

circulation, as well the need for 
financial responsibility, The Daily 
is printing once a week rather 
than five days. We will also print 
special editions this semester — be 
sure to pick up a print copy of our 
Welcome Back issue on Monday, 
Aug. 31. We will not, however, 
continue creating digital PDF 
papers without a print counterpart 
on our issuu as we did in March 
and throughout the summer.

None of this will impact our 

core mission and responsibility: 
to inform our readers and to hold 
the people with power at this 
University and in Washtenaw 
County 
accountable. 
These 

past few weeks, we’ve reported 
tirelessly on various issues with 
the University’s reopening, from 
unenforced housing precautions 
to concerns about testing plans. 
Not to mention our summer 
staff’s reporting on racial justice 
protests, WilmerHale’s report on 
former Provost Martin Philbert’s 
sexual misconduct and The Big 
Ten’s football postponement. This 
coverage will continue.

With classes for the fall term 

starting Monday, research labs 
are set to welcome students 
back as well. However, in 
adherence to social distancing 
guidelines, the University of 
Michigan Office of Research 
has limited research capacity 
to only 45 percent density 
during 
shifts, 
causing 
all 

undergraduate 
students 

except seniors to miss out on 
in-person research experience 
this semester. 

Though 
the 
University 

opened 
limited 
research 

over the summer, in-person 
undergraduate research was 
deemed “non-essential” and 
did not resume.

Based on the latest weekly 

research 
reengagement 

update from the Office of 
Research, published Thursday, 
undergraduate students can 
only rejoin labs in which they 
“already 
have 
experience 

working 
with 
the 
same 

research 
team” 
and 
“may 

not be left alone in research 
spaces.”

From the A&I Committee: A look 
at TMD’s Demographic Report

An internal survey of The Michigan Daily’s staff members offers data on 
the publication as well as a view of the barriers to access in the newsroom 

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
News
2 — Wednesday, September 2, 2020 

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily

The Michigan Daily shares data collected from a demographic survey conducted over the summer of 2020.

The Michigan Daily conducted 

a demographics survey during the 
summer of 2020 to gain a better 
understanding of the barriers to 
access in our newsroom. After 
keeping the anonymous survey 
open for one month, 282 staffers 
responded to the survey out of 488 
staffers total in both the Editorial 
and Business halves of The Daily, a 
57.8 percent response rate. 

The recently formed Access and 

Inclusion Committee created a 
report summarizing the findings. 
We created another survey asking 
anyone in the newsroom to share 
their thoughts on the results, 
anonymously if preferred, and have 
included all responses.

The 
2020 
Demographics 

Survey largely confirmed that our 
newsroom is a majority rich, white, 
hetero and cis organization much 
like the rest of the University of 
Michigan. Latinx, first-gen and 
low-income students in particular 
are 
underrepresented 
at 
The 

Michigan Daily compared to the 
general campus population. 

While we acknowledge that 

this data is not entirely reflective 
of our newsroom because of non-
response, the numbers still hold 
great value. The Daily has clear 
socioeconomic, 
racial, 
ethnic, 

gender and sexuality disparities. 
Acknowledging this, The Access 
and Inclusion committee and the 
newsroom as a whole can move 
forward prioritizing diversity and 
inclusion. 

The Daily created two Access 

and Inclusion co-chair positions 
in 2018 for students outside of the 
newsroom to help with conflict 
resolution and diversity, equity 
and inclusion work. This summer, 
Access and Inclusion has expanded 
to a committee of four students, 
and we’re looking to hire one more.

We are committed to ensuring 

that 
The 
Daily 
grows 
more 

representative of all identities 
on our campus. Without this, 
we know our newsroom and our 
coverage suffer because we do not 
accurately reflect the communities 
that we serve. 

Our purpose is not to fill some 

diversity quota or to uphold an 
appearance of diversity. Rather, 
we are committed to making sure 
that people from all backgrounds 
and experiences, especially those 
with marginalized backgrounds, 
feel welcomed at The Daily and feel 
encouraged to make their voices 
heard. 

Income Level and Student 

Status 

The Daily does not pay its 

staffers much for their work, and 
the survey reveals that we are 
not accessible to lower-income 
students as a result.

Here are some of the most telling 

statistics:

• 
There are three times 
more staffers from families 
making $200,000 per year 
than staffers from families 
making less than $75,000 
per year. 

• 
Though 14.8 percent of 
undergraduates 
at 
the 

University 
come 
from 

families making less than 
$50,000, only 6.8 percent 
of The Daily’s staffers do. 

• 
Only 
16 
staffers 
who 

responded to the survey 
said they were work-study 
students.

One staffer said he wants to 

know if the socioeconomic divide is 
even more apparent among editors 
at The Daily. He noted that editors 
have to commit large amounts of 
time to the newspaper before and 
during their tenure, which is less 
possible for lower-income students. 

Though the survey didn’t ask 

for the positions of those who 
responded, we believe an even 
greater stratification of income is 
very likely among editors based on 
the nature of editor roles. 

LSA senior Aria Gerson, a 

sportswriter on the football beat, 
said she “grew up solidly middle 
class, so I was pretty shocked to see 
that 70 percent of The Daily staff is 
richer than I am.”

Similarly, LSA sophomore Haley 

Johnson, an assistant social media 
editor, said, “As a low income 
student, I was really shocked by 
the income distribution of Daily 
staffers. I hope we can work to get 
better class representation on our 
staff.”

One thing The Daily should do 

is create an easily accessible list 
of Daily scholarships, third-party 
journalism scholarships and paid 
internship opportunities, Gerson 
said. Though The Daily sends these 
resources sporadically, Gerson said 
she’s largely had to find them on 
her own.

16.3 percent chose not to answer 

any income-level related questions. 

Race and Ethnicity 
The majority of staffers in 

the newsroom are white. Asian 
staffers, while still a minority in the 
newsroom, make up a much greater 
percentage of the newsroom than 
all other POC staffers combined. 

Gerson suggested that The Daily 

could work with other campus 
outlets to establish student chapters 
of certain national journalism 

associations, such as Association 
for Women in Sports Media, 
National Association of Black 
Journalists, National Association 
of Hispanic Journalists and the 
Asian 
American 
Journalists 

Association. 

“This would likely help recruit 

more 
diverse 
talent 
because 

students could see more people 
in this industry who looked like 
them and those orgs also provide 
tons of internship and scholarship 
opportunities,” Gerson said. 

Gender and Sexuality

LSA 
junior 
Alex 
Harring, 
a 

senior news editor, said The Daily 

should consider creating employee 

resources groups, which exist at many 

professional outlets. 

He pointed to NBC, which has a 

Black Employee Network, OUT at NBC, 

Women at NBC.

“(It’s a) great way to build community 

and have a space to share ideas and 

concerns,” Harring said. “Could be as 

simple as a pizza dinner once a month 

or something like that!”

The Daily: Post-COVID-19 and the 

Death of George Floyd

About 9 percent of those who 

responded to the survey or their 

immediate families have contracted 
the coronavirus. Out of these 9 
percent, about 16 percent said they 
or their family member could not 
access adequate medical care.

Only 27 percent of staffers said 

they thought about their race on a 
daily basis prior to George Floyd’s 
death. That number shot up to 
81.9 percent after George Floyd’s 
death.

Other
All 50 states and four countries 

outside of the United States (Chile, 
Hong Kong, India and Taiwan) 
are represented at The Daily. The 
Daily has a similar in-state vs. out-
of-state proportion as the general 
undergraduate population. 

The large majority of students 

(70.5 percent) are in the School of 
Literature, Science and the Arts. 

Notably, 
a 
significant 

proportion of staffers are new. 
Close to 60 percent have been at 

The Daily for less than one year, 
while a bit more than a quarter of 
the staffers have been at The Daily 
for 4 semesters or more. 

Next Steps
With this information, the 

Access and Inclusion committee 
has been taking the following 
actions to ensure our goals are 
upheld. First, we have been 
communicating with several other 
newsrooms who have succeeded in 
their inclusion efforts in attempts 
to emulate their achievements and 
learn from their mistakes. 

In the future, we will continue 

conducting more demographic 
surveys, publishing the results and 
remaining transparent with our 
progress. In these surveys, Art and 
Design senior Emily Considine, 
editorial page editor, said she 
hopes to see more section-specific 
data, “if only to help recruitment 
committees and section heads 
understand the ways in which our 
specific sections need to improve 
in attracting and representing the 
rest of the University.”

This 
year’s 
Access 
and 

Inclusion committee chose not 
to ask staffers for their section. 
We thought some students might 
worry this information could be 
identifying, especially if there 
is only one person of a certain 
identity in a given section — 
which points to our newsroom’s 
lack 
of 
diversity. 
However, 

we will make this an optional 
question in the future, allowing 
for a deeper understanding of 
our demographics so that we 
can implement more effective 
recruiting strategies. 

In addition, we are in the process 

of planning a racial bias and 
reporting sensitivity workshop, 
and our hope is to make similar 
workshops routine every semester. 
This workshop will be mandatory 
for all students on staff. We will 
also 
compile 
past 
resources 

together to create streamlined 
guides on inclusive style and how 
to cover communities that one may 
not be a part of.

Lastly, we want to build stronger 

and 
more 
trusting 
relations 

with 
communities 
who 
have 

historically not had such relations 
with journalists. The News section 
has reached out and met with 
several prominent student groups 
about their thoughts on our past 
coverage and how we can work 
together in the future. 

We encourage members of our 

community to hold us accountable 
to make all the changes listed 
above become reality. We want to 
ensure marginalized voices on our 
campus are heard and that we end 
the historical trend of The Daily 
being a predominantly white, cis, 
hetero and rich institution.

Police 
officers 
followed 

Jermaine Johnston down the 
Hatcher Graduate Library steps 
on a finals week night more than 
20 years ago for no reason. He said 
he was used to it — being treated 
as less intelligent during office 
hours, asked what sport he played 
on the first day of classes and met 
with silence when he walked into 
an all-white room. 

“I had a bookbag on my back, 

a University of Michigan shirt, 
University of Michigan hat, proud 
to be in the place that didn’t 
always accept me,” Johnston. 

Johnston 
stood 
on 
those 

same steps on the Diag Saturday 
morning, addressing a crowd of 
several hundred protesting for 
racial justice after police officers 
in Wisconsin shot Jacob Blake, a 
29-year-old Black man, leaving 
him paralyzed from the waist 
down. 

Johnston, now a minister and 

father to a University student, 
said he was getting into “good 
trouble.”

“I refuse for my children 

to grow up the way I grew 
up, to continue to have these 
same arguments, these same 
discussions, 50 years from now,” 
Johnston told The Daily. “I want 
to close my eyes one day and know 

we really had progress in this 
country.”

University 
students, 

community members and elected 
officials of all ages and races 
took part in speeches on racial 
inequality on the Diag before 
marching 
through 
downtown 

Ann Arbor in an event organized 
by the non-profit Survivors Speak.

Trische Duckworth, executive 

director of Survivors Speak, wore 
a shirt with seven bullet holes 
painted on the back to signify the 
seven times white police officers 
shot Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. 

“We never pose a threat,” 

Duckworth said. “You know what 
the threat is? It’s the color of our 
skin.”

Duckworth and Tracy Van den 

Bergh, a candidate for Washtenaw 
Circuit Court judge, read aloud a 
list of dozens of people killed by 
police in recent years, including 
Tamir Rice and Eric Gardner.

“Don’t forget their names,” Van 

den Bergh said.

She implored the mostly white 

audience 
to 
challenge 
their 

friends and family who respond 
“all lives matter” to the Black 
Lives Matter movement.

“If all lives really matter, there 

would not be the disproportionate 
murder of Black brothers and 
sisters in our streets, and so many 
people would be alive today,” Van 
den Bergh said.

U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell, 

D-Mich, 
said 
there 
is 
an 

“uncomfortable” 
reality 
in 

America.

“If you are a Black man, you are 

treated differently than a white 
man,” Dingell said. 

Eli 
Savit, 
Democratic 

candidate for Washtenaw County 
prosecutor, held up a pocket knife 
he found on the floor of his car 
a few days ago and compared 
it to the knife police have said 
they found under the floorboard 
of Blake’s car at the time of the 
shooting. Savit said his pocket 
knife had probably been on 
the floor for months before he 
realized it. 

“I never once thought that 

because of the presence of that 
knife in my car that I would be 
dehumanized, that I would be 
presumed to be dangerous,” Savit 
said. “That is the systemic racism 
that we’re talking about.”

After 
remarks 
from 
Nick 

Roumel, candidate for Washtenaw 
County Circuit Judge, and Krystal 
Dupree, candidate for Ann Arbor 
School Board of Education, as well 
as other local activists, protesters 
left the Diag to march. They 
walked down South State Street 
chanting “Black lives matter.” 

masks and maintain appropriate 
distance from one another — are 
supposed to help students adhere 
to public health guidelines and 
manage 
off-campus 
student 

gatherings. 

Since its implementation on 

Aug. 20, the program has faced 
pushback both for its perceived 
lack of enforcement measures 
and for working with police 
officers. 

Now, unarmed DPSS security 

and administrative staff will 
be “provided to support” the 
ambassadors, according to the 
website. 

Prior to this reversal, police 

officers from the Ann Arbor 
Police 
Department 
and 
the 

University’s Division of Public 
Safety & Security patrolled with 
the ambassadors. It is unclear 
if the officers who previously 
accompanied them were armed.

University’s 
Office 
of 

Public Affairs did not respond

the 
program 

seemed 
tone-deaf 
after 
a 

summer 
of 
protests 
against 

police brutality.

Music, 
Theatre 
& 
Dance 

senior 
Jack 
Williams, 
the 

chaplain of Alpha Phi Alpha, 
a Black fraternity on campus, 
previously told The Daily he 
was worried about the program 
because AAPD has a history of 
over-policing Black fraternities.

“Let’s say we’re not having 

a party, and it’s just a small 
kickback, not a lot of people, but 
that the police will be called on 
us still,” Williams said. “That’s 

my concern, and I think a lot 
of Black students at Michigan 
share that same concern.”

The 
ambassadors 
are 

currently 
walking 
around 

campus 
and 
in 
off-campus 

residential neighborhoods every 
day from noon to midnight. After 
Sunday night, the ambassadors 
will work only Thursday through 
Saturday every week for the rest 
of the semester.

Students are required to wear 

face masks while on campus 
and to stay six feet apart from 
those outside their household. 
Gatherings indoors are limited 
to 10 people, while outdoor 
events are limited to 25. The 
University’s 
Twitter 
account 

garnered criticism for using 
a Drake meme to signal that 
gatherings of 25 people are 
allowed 
while 
discouraging 

larger groups.

All students were given the 

choice to opt into a voluntary 
address registry at the beginning 
of the year. When a concern is 
reported through the COVID-
19 hotline, the ambassadors will 
answer the hotline and text or 
call those responsible. 

“Students can receive updates 

from the ambassador program 
if a concern about their address 
surfaces before midnight during 
operating days of the program, 
giving them the opportunity to 
address the situation without 
police involvement as the first 
response,” the website reads.

If a phone number is not 

available 
for 
that 
address, 

ambassadors will respond to the 
location of the reported concern.

Prior to the update, the 

University has said the hotline 
will directly forward to DPSS 

after midnight and on days 
when the ambassadors are off-
duty. Now, “callers will have the 
option of leaving a message (for 
non-urgent concerns) or being 
transferred to dispatch services 
to request a law enforcement 
response,” the website reads.

Some community members 

have 
also 
disparaged 
the 

Michigan Ambassadors program 
for being too lenient in its initial 
outreach. 

In 
a 
previous 
interview, 

Public Health junior Bushra 
Hassan said she does not think 
the 
Michigan 
Ambassadors 

initiative 
will 
be 
effective 

without strong consequences for 
people who break the rules. 

“I 
don’t 
think 
they 
can 

effectively make people go home, 
because students can’t force 
students to do anything,” Hassan 
said.

According to the updated 

website, “repeat reports will 
be 
addressed 
with 
warning 

letters, referrals and citations 
from law enforcement for noise 
and public health violations, as 
appropriate.” Other University 
offices such as Fraternity and 
Sorority Life and the Dean of 
Students may also reach out. 

Depending on the severity 

of the situation, students could 
also face “removal from housing, 
removal from specific courses 
or activities, suspension from 
the University or expulsion,” the 
website reads.

Anyone who sees a violation 

of these policies can call the 
COVID-19 Concerns hotline at 
734-647-3000.

The Faculty Senate Office 

confirmed the meeting was the 
highest attended on record with 
more than 550 attendees.

A faculty member confirmed 

to The Daily that a motion 
of 
no 
confidence 
in 
the 

administration’s reopening plan 
was submitted to be considered. 
Other 
faculty 
members 
told 

The Daily there appeared to be 
support for holding a vote of no 
confidence during a portion of 
the meeting the press was not 
invited to attend.

Information 
Professor 

Kentaro 
Toyama, 
a 
SACUA 

Representative and organizer of 
recent demonstrations against 
reopening campus, asked SACUA 
to consider a vote on a motion 
of no confidence in either the 
University administration or its 
reopening plans.

“In my four years in faculty 

governance, I haven’t yet seen 
the administration give an 
inch on key issues, though they 
are very good at providing 
the impression that they care 
about our opinions. I don’t 
think this is governance, this 
is dictatorship,” Toyama said. 
“And, if that seems a little bit 
alarmist, it’s because I really 
believe we are in a moment in 
which we have to do something 
a little bit more than make polite 
requests.”

Faculty express concerns 

over fall semester

Physics 
professor 
Dante 

Amidei 
echoed 
Toyama’s 

sentiment 
that 
the 

administration 
hasn’t 
done 

a 
sufficient 
job 
of 
taking 

into 
account 
faculty 
input. 

Amidei 
recently 
sent 
two 

petitions 
to 
the 
University 

administration that called for 
a more robust universal testing 
program and to which he said 
received no response from the 
administration.

“What 
we 
have 
heard 

(from the University) is an 
ad-hoc argument to discredit 
the importance of universal 
testing,” 
Amidei 
said. 
“We 

have never seen a model or an 
analysis that predicts the risk 
levels for this U-M plan. Maybe 
there isn’t one and we are flying 
blind. Or maybe there is one and 
we wouldn’t like the answer.”

Amidei said he wished the 

University would follow the 
lead of other peer institutions 
in using the pandemic as 
an 
opportunity 
to 
pioneer 

containment of illness. He said 
the University has no strategy, 
only 
“downstream 
crisis 

control.” 

University 
spokesperson 

Kim Broekhuizen emphasized 
that the University plans on 
increasing testing efforts in an 
email to The Daily. 

“Surveillance 
testing 

asymptomatic students, faculty 
and staff will occur each week. 
We will launch registration 
for our program next week 
and 
anticipate 
ramping 
up 

testing to approximately 3,000 
individuals weekly by the end 

of 
September,” 
Broekhuizen 

wrote. 
“Additional 
testing 

efforts include 1500 tests for 
students moving into affiliated 
fraternity and sorority houses.”

Broekhuizen also said that 

prior to arrival on campus, 91 
percent of undergraduates in 
on-campus housing have been 
tested, while the remainder are 
currently being tested. This 
means that of approximately 
8,300 students living in dorms, 
around 750 are waiting for their 
COVID-19 test results.

Engineering 
professor 

Michael 
Atzmon 
voiced 

his concern for compliance 
with 
University 
guidelines, 

after complaints of housing 
precautions going unenforced 
during dormitory move-in and 
reports of off-campus parties 
that potentially violate public 
health 
mandates. 
Atzmon 

criticized 
the 
University’s 

tweet to dismiss gatherings of 
26, but approve those of 25, in 
accordance with Washtenaw 
County guidelines. 

“On 
Aug. 
16, 
President 

Schlissel said he was a little 
insulted 
by 
the 
suggestion 

that our students will not act 
responsibly,” 
Atzmon 
said, 

referring to comments Schlissel 
made in an interview with The 
Daily. “So I guess President 
Schlissel finds reality offensive. 
Many of us have seen images of 
our students having a great time 
in recent days in large groups 
and without masks. Now there’s 
even a U of M tweet telling them 
to have parties with 25 people.”

Atzmon said even if students 

and faculty follow University 
guidelines, he still believes 
there is a high level of risk 
related to in-person classes.

Lisa Disch, the U-M political 

science professor who was 
recently elected to Ann Arbor 
City Council for Ward 1, said the 
risk of bringing students back 
to campus could impact the 
local community. Disch said the 
University’s plans impose a high 
level of risk on the community, 
so moving to an entirely remote 
format would be a better avenue 
to ensure public safety.

“We 
live 
in 
the 
most 

segregated county in Michigan, 
and the pandemic makes us one 
community in the worst way. It 
does cross neighborhood lines 
and it does cross economic 
strata,” Disch said. “It will have 
the most devastating impact 
on county residents who are 
the 
most 
vulnerable. 
They 

are essential workers whose 
paychecks do not reflect the 
magnitude of the risks they take 
for this community.”

Meeting comes on heels of 

leaked memo

At the meeting, comparative 

literature professor Silke-Maria 
Weineck brought up concerns 
about the COVID-19 Ethics 
and Privacy Committee’s July 
31 memo to President Schlissel. 
She said the memo highlights 
how unconfident community 
members feel about the current 
plan for reopening campus.

“Our main point here is 

not to advocate for a specific 
solution, 
but 
rather 
to 

underscore, with urgency, our 

concern that current plans for 
Fall 2020 will not meet the 
reasonable standard for safety 
recommended by our report, 
that good alternatives exist, and 
that it is not too late to pursue 
them,” Weineck quoted from 
the memo during the meeting.

Gilbert Omenn, chair of the 

COVID-19 Ethics and Privacy 
Committee and public health 
professor, confirmed that the 
committee still stands by its 
statements in the memo in an 
email to The Daily. Omenn also 
mentioned that the committee 
did not receive a response from 
President Schlissel, though no 
response was expected.

Toyama said he is worried 

about the memo not having been 
made public by the University 
and that he hopes all of the 
final reports from COVID-19 
committees in the provost’s and 
president’s offices should be 
made public. He highlighted that 
the memo states a coronavirus 
outbreak will be likely and 
will disproportionately impact 
people of color and low-income 
communities.

In an email to The Daily, 

Amanda Kaplan and Saveri 
Nandigama, 
CSG 
president 

and 
vice 
president, 
said 

they 
believe 
constructive 

criticism can help improve the 
University’s 
decision-making 

processes. They also noted 
that the reopening plan was a 
University-wide effort and that 
criticism should not be solely 
directed at President Schlissel.

“We believe that, no matter 

what 
the 
decision 
is, 
the 

University needs to ensure 
that the needs of students, 
faculty, and staff are heard 
and 
addressed 
accordingly,” 

Kaplan, a Public Policy senior, 
and Nandigama, an LSA senior, 
wrote. “This report doesn’t 
change our opinion, but it does 
highlight and recognize the 
need to create an atmosphere 
that is conducive to the success 
of all students, especially those 
from communities of color and 
other vulnerable communities.”

Peter Railton, a member 

of the COVID-19 Ethics and 
Privacy 
Committee 
and 

philosophy professor, suggested 
that faculty should work within 
the hybrid teaching framework 
to declare that they will teach 
their courses online without 
waiting for permission or policy 
changes. Railton noted that he 
was not speaking on behalf of 
the committee, but as a faculty 
member.

“Some of the most dangerous 

steps in reopening universities 
such as bringing students back 
to the dorms have already been 
taken, and at this point it may 
be too late to stop the spread of 
the kind that we’ve seen at other 
large universities,” Railton said. 
“But we’re not powerless as a 
faculty to take steps that we 
think can materially increase 
safety 
for 
our 
students, 

faculty, staff and the wider 
communities.”

The lawsuit claims that 

Trifecta Productions, LLC, 
the 
company 
that 
owns 

Tomukun, did not respect 
Prada’s rights as an essential 
employee 
during 
the 

pandemic and fired him only 
after learning that he may 
have contracted COVID-19 
at a party he attended earlier 
that month. It also claims that 
Prada was refused payment 
in the weeks he was out of 
work because of his illness. 

“As a frontline essential 

worker, Mr. Prada risked 
his health for the benefit 
of the restaurant and its 
customers,” the lawsuit reads. 
“After refusing to pay him 
legally required sick leave 
compensation, 
Tomukun 

Noodle Bar unceremoniously 
fired 
Mr. 
Prada 
after 

interrogating him regarding 
the origin of his illness and 
telling 
him 
that 
‘for 
PR 

reasons it would be best for 
you not to come back.’”

Prada began working at 

Tomukun in January 2018 
and served as a waiter and 
assistant manager. According 
to the lawsuit, he reported 
feeling sick to his manager on 
June 24 and stayed home from 
work, later testing positive 
for COVID-19 on June 27. 
Prada was ordered by the 
Washtenaw County Health 
Department 
to 
quarantine 

for two weeks in his home 
following his positive test 
result. 

The lawsuit said that once 

Prada completed his two-
week 
quarantine, 
he 
had 

a 
22-minute 
conversation 

about returning to work with 
Yong Hum Yon, Tomukun’s 
owner. During this call, Yon 
allegedly 
said 
there 
was 

social 
media 
evidence 
of 

Prada at parties and asked 
him not to return to work. 
Prada was fired on July 11. 

Yon did not respond to 

request for comment. 

The lawsuit also invokes 

an 
executive 
order 
from 

Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 

as evidence that Tomukun 
retaliated against Prada for 
contracting COVID-19. The 
order, as signed on April 
3, says that employers are 
prohibited from discharging 
an employee because they 
stayed home from work due 
to illness.

“Individuals permitted to 

go to work under Executive 
Order 
2020-21 
must 
stay 

home when they or their 
close contacts are sick—and 
they must not be punished 
for doing so,” the order reads. 
“Accordingly, it is reasonable 
and necessary to provide 
certain protections against 
workplace discrimination to 
such individuals, to ensure 
they can do what is now most 
needed from them to protect 
the health and safety of this 
state and its residents.”

The 
Daily 
sat 
down 
with 

University of Michigan President 
Mark Schlissel to discuss the 
University’s plans for the fall 
semester 
during 
the 
COVID-

19 pandemic and the release of 
WilmerHale’s report on allegations 
of 
sexual 
misconduct 
against 

former Provost Martin Philbert.

This interview has been edited 

and condensed for clarity.

Mark Schlissel: I wanted to 

start out if it’s OK with you by 
reiterating an apology that I’ve 
offered to a number of individuals, 
and then to a group as a whole 
that wrote me a letter — I want 
to get their name correct — the 
Queer Advocacy Coalition … I was 
making comments in one of the 
town halls around the logic behind 
our surveillance testing and the 
pluses and minuses of testing 
asymptomatic students in an 
effort to diminish transmission of 
the disease. And one of the things 
I said is a fear that if a student 
learns they’re negative, that might 
diminish their incentive to follow 
masking and distancing and the 
like. And I made what turned out 
to be a very bad and insensitive 
analogy with HIV disease — AIDS, 
and it was really hurtful to a lot of 
people. It was incorrect with the 
history. I feel very badly about it. So 
I just wanted another opportunity 
to say sorry, to promise to be more 
careful and to express my empathy 
with that group for any pain or 
discomfort that I caused with 
some remarks that just shouldn’t 
have been offered.

The 
Michigan 
Daily: 

Universities 
that 
originally 

planned 
for 
some 
forms 
of 

in-person classes, like University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
reversed their decisions and went 
entirely online after only about 
a week of classes. Meanwhile, 
Michigan State announced an 
all online semester and Eastern 
Michigan delayed move-in. So 
why is the University of Michigan 
any different?

MS: Well, we may prove not 

to be, but I think that we are 
different. We’ve planned and 
worked very hard on getting 
things as optimal as we can. I have 
confidence in our students. But 
in reality, if you think about what 
the difference is between a remote 
semester and what we’re talking 
about now, as of now 77 percent of 
our student credit hours are being 
offered remotely. 

… Every young person I talked 

to, well, they’re always being 
honest. They say that they’d rather 
be with their friends. They’d 
rather not live at home some more. 
So, going fully remote is a pretty 
incremental 
difference 
from 

where we are right now. And it 
wouldn’t have left people at home. 
We’d still have lots of students in 
Ann Arbor, and we’d still have the 
challenge of working with students 
to help everybody understand 
what it takes to be safe from being 
infected and from transmitting 
the disease … I’ve been in 
pretty close contact with other 
campuses around the country, 
including UNC and including 
Notre Dame and including many 
of my colleagues in the Big Ten, 
asking them what’s worked for 
them, what hasn’t worked, what’s 
the most surprising. And so far, 
the campuses that have run into 
difficulty trace it to off-campus 
student life … So it could turn out 
that we prove to be like everybody 
else. I always try to be better.

TMD: On that note, Chief 

Health Officer Preeti Malani told 
The Daily that one big party could 
shut the whole semester down. So 
then, if that’s the case and we’re 
seeing students at other schools 
and the University of Michigan 
already starting to party, why 
bring everyone back to then 
potentially send them home?

MS: I don’t bring everyone back 

and I don’t send everybody home. 
Many of the students who are 
living here in Ann Arbor are gonna 
continue living in Ann Arbor in 
their private residences under 
their leases — not everybody of 
course, but many. I also think 
Dr. Malani was exercising a bit 

of hyperbole by saying one big 
party is all it’s gonna take. I hope 
we don’t have one big party with 
a super-spreader event, but there 
will be spreading events. There 
were spreading events when you 
all were living at home … so there 
will be spread of the disease. It’s 
not the students’ fault. It’s not 
the University’s fault. It’s the 
pandemic’s fault. So it’s up to us 
to protect ourselves as best we 
can and to protect one another. 
Although there is a chance that 
there’ll be too many episodes 
where folks let their guard down, 
and too many people become 
infected and there’s too much 
spread for us to keep up with 
with testing, contact tracing and 
quarantine, then we would have 
to go fully remote. But recognize 
that doesn’t mean people are 
going home … The students in 
the dormitories, we can certainly 
encourage them to leave. There 
are a fraction of students in our 
dorms that don’t have other safe 
places to live, so I wouldn’t want 
to throw them (out) … it’s not as 
simple as saying “let’s go remote,” 
and then there’s no more risk. 

TMD: In a similar vein, schools 

like Tulane, for example, have 
banned gatherings of more than 15 
people and threatened expulsion 
for students who did not follow 
the mandate. Will the University 
of Michigan consider similar 
academic 
repercussions 
for 

violating social distancing rules?

MS: Well, I think as a very last 

resort, the Student Statement 
of Rights and Responsibilities 
does give the University the 
opportunity to do things of the 
type that you’re mentioning. Those 
aren’t first resorts. They’re last 
resorts. But I think people do have 
to recognize — particularly on 
our campus in our classrooms, in 
our dormitories, but also with one 
another in town — that they have 
to live up to the Student Statement 
of Rights and Responsibilities and 
then be subject to the downstream 
consequences of behavior that 
doesn’t live up to our aspirations.

TMD: 
Some 
community 

members have called for more 
transparency 
with 
opening 

plans, models used and analysis 
done, 
and 
just 
more 
details 

about containment plans as we 
approach the beginning of the 
semester. Why has the University 
not provided such details to the 
members of the community who 
have to make important decisions 
about their safety and the safety of 
those around them, based on these 
plans?

MS: With respect to those 

raising 
the 
question 
or 
the 

criticism, it’s always possible to 
provide more information. But if 
you look back on the number of 
communications that have come 
from me and other campus leaders 
in the last several months, it’s 
actually been an overwhelming 
number in very long and great 
detail — multiple town halls 
with different groups, dedicated 
and regularly updated Maize 
and Blueprint website, data on 
COVID-19 
on 
campus 
that’s 

now up there and live. So there’s 
been a lot of communication. In 
particular, when we talk about 
what we would have to see in order 
to change our plans, everyone’s 
looking for a magic formula that 
if you have a certain number 
— like Dr. Malani said “one big 
party,” — we’d all go home. That’s 
not a complete statement. We’re 
tracking things like the rate of 
infection on campus, how many 
new cases per day. We’re looking 
at the distribution of where those 
cases are. Are they in clusters of 
events? Can we contact trace and 
quarantine downstream of those 
or does it exceed our capacity? 
… The difficulty for most folks is 
understanding that there’s not 
a magic formula. What there 
is is judgment in looking at the 
numbers and trends of a bunch of 
markers and taking advantage of 
our public health experts that are 
doing the same thing on behalf of 
the governor of the state.

TMD: 
Students 
and 

administrators across the country 
have publicly battled over who’s 
responsible 
for 
COVID-19 

outbreaks on campus. For example, 
a Syracuse official called students 
attending large gatherings “selfish 
and reckless.” On the other hand, 

an editorial from UNC’s student 
newspaper argued “it was the 
University’s 
responsibility 
to 

disincentivize such gatherings by 
reconsidering its plans to operate 
in-person earlier on.” So who 
takes responsibility if there are 
large outbreaks on campus at the 
University of Michigan this fall?

MS: 
I 
put 
responsibility 

squarely on the virus. So this 
is a pandemic. The virus isn’t 
prejudiced. It infects people when 
they’re susceptible and available 
for infection. I don’t think any 
of us wants to get sick. I don’t 
think anybody, no matter what 
their behavior is, wants to get 
sick. My job as a campus leader, 
working with our Student Life 
people and our academic leaders 
and our safety people, is to try to 
create an environment that allows 
students to be educated about the 
virus, to take responsibility for 
themselves, to make their own 
decisions as adults — as young 
adults, but adults — in how to 
keep themselves, their friends and 
their families safe. And my job is 
to provide the education and the 
environment, and then the backup 
and support for you to be able to do 
this, all the while making sure that 
this pandemic doesn’t trash your 
ability to have college … I don’t 
hold students responsible, I don’t 
hold Student Life responsible, I 
don’t hold myself — in that sense 
— responsible. It’s the virus. We’re 
all humans. We’re all capable 
of outstanding behavior. We’re 
all very obviously capable of 
momentary lapses in behavior… 

TMD: So then you feel like 

the University is as prepared as it 
possibly could be?

MS: I think every day we 

become better at what we do. 
So I would of course not say 
that we’re optimally prepared, 
because none of us have ever been 
through this before … We’re all 
trying to make our way through 
a complicated and completely 
novel set of circumstances. For 
example, there’s been a lot of 
attention focused on this issue of 
testing. And there’s a notion that 
if we could simply test everybody 
all the time, nobody would get 
sick. And that’s an exaggerated 
statement, so I don’t want to get in 
trouble making more exaggerated 
statements, but testing detects 
if you’re already sick. It doesn’t 
prevent you from being sick. The 
whole state of Michigan right now 
is averaging around 25,000 tests a 
day — the whole state … If we were 
to test everybody twice a week, 
we would dramatically exceed 
the testing done in our 10 million 
person state. What we are doing is 
we’re recognizing that surveillance 
testing is an important part of 
keeping the community safe. … The 
way you work on these problems is 
you do as much sort of theoretical 
thinking in advance as you can, 
and then you have the flexibility to 
modify and change as you actually 
implement and try to make things 
better every day. So I don’t feel 
optimally prepared. I argue that 
nobody in the country probably 
feels globally prepared. Our nation 
was not optimally prepared and it’s 
struggling to get to that level, but 
we’ll get better at this every day.

TMD: Tuition from students is a 

substantial part of the University’s 
revenue, and according to a survey 
conducted by Central Student 
Government over the summer, 
a majority of students surveyed 
said they would consider changing 
their plans and not enrolling full 
time if courses were fully online. 
If more funding were available 
from the state of Michigan and the 
federal government, would you 
have been more comfortable with a 
fully remote semester?

MS: More funding is always 

welcome … But I think what we 
would have endeavored to do, 
regardless of resources, is provide 
the courses in person that students 
can only take in person, that they 
need for their programs, they 
need for licensure, they need to 
progress to graduation, which is, 
you know, pretty much, pretty 
similar to what we’re doing now. 
But the additional funding would 
have allowed us to do this, passing 
less of the burden onto students 
and their families.

With less than one week 

until the first day of classes, 
some students, faculty and staff 
have raised concerns about 
how the University of Michigan 
will contain possible COVID-
19 
outbreaks. 
Among 
these 

concerns is how students will 
quarantine or isolate themselves 
to prevent spreading the virus, 
particularly those living in off-
campus housing. 

The University says there are 

600 rooms available for students 
who need to quarantine, but 
it remains unclear how and 
to whom these rooms will 
be 
provided. 
According 
to 

the 
University’s 
Maize 
and 

Blueprint website, the hub of 
information related to various 
COVID-19 policies, there will be 
spaces identified for “any U-M 
student who needs quarantine/
isolation.” 

The page also specifies that 

the Washtenaw County Health 
Department, 
in 
coordination 

with 
the 
University, 
will 

determine whether a student’s 
off-campus living situation is 
adequate to quarantine or isolate 
them effectively. 

In an email to The Daily, 

University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen 
confirmed 
off-

campus students could use the 
quarantine housing, assuming 
their situation meets certain 
qualifications. 

“The 
university 
isolation 

and 
quarantine 
plan 
does 

allow for off-campus students 
to be placed in the designated 
isolation or quarantine space,” 
Broekhuizen wrote. “(This is) if 
the current living arrangement 
is determined to be unsuitable 
and the student is unable to go to 
a permanent home.” 

The Health Department will 

evaluate each off-campus living 
arrangement on a case-by-case 
basis as people living there test 
positive for COVID-19. If too 
many off-campus students need 
space to quarantine, however, 
the Health Department may not 
be able to quickly manage all of 
those evaluations. 

Susan 
Ringler-Cerniglia, 

public 
information 
officer 

for 
the 
Washtenaw 
County 

Health Department, said the 
department’s resources could 
quickly 
be 
overwhelmed 
if 

cases spread due to students 
congregating.

“All 
these 
factors 
could 

combine to mean that cases 
spread 
very, 
very 
quickly,” 

Ringler-Cerniglia 
said. 
“So 

we as a health department, of 
course, have a limited capacity 
and limited number of folks 
that are able to follow up and 
do that case investigation and 
contact tracing. So if there’s all 
of a sudden a very large number 
of cases related to the reopening, 
then yes, our resources could be 
quickly overwhelmed.” 

LSA junior Samuel Burnstein 

said he believes the University’s 
communication has been unclear 
about how students living off-
campus should proceed if they 
or someone they live with tests 
positive for COVID-19 and needs 
to quarantine. 

“There’s been a barrage of 

emails in the last two to three 
months 
about 
changes 
to 

policies and updates to policies 
and 
revisions 
to 
policies,” 

Burnstein said. “And it’s so hard 
to discern what the current 
(policy is), where to even find 
that policy. It’s not something 
that is easily Google-able. So if 
I were to get sick on the third 
day of school being open, I don’t 
know immediately how to go 
about finding testing and I’m 
sure I’m not alone in that. And 
that’s what is kind of very utterly 
frustrating.” 

Testing 
for 
symptomatic 

students is offered through 
University Health Services. In 
addition to the standard advice 
of limiting in-person contact, 
cleaning surfaces often and 
monitoring for symptoms of 
COVID-19, there are certain 
steps to take if someone in a 
communal living arrangement 
contracts the virus. 

Students who test positive 

after visiting a non-University 
affiliated testing site are asked 
to report their case here. For 
non-symptomatic students who 
want a test, the University has a 
list of outside vendors.

According 
to 
guidance 

from Michigan Medicine, it 
is important to pick a “sick” 
bedroom and bathroom the 
infected person alone can use. 
Their laundry should also be 
kept 
separate. 
Roommates 

can help them track changes 
and ease their symptoms by 
helping them to eat and hydrate 
regularly. Visitors should be 
limited and those who live there 
should stay home.

After 
the 
person 
has 

recovered, they should remain 
quarantined 
until 
they 
are 

fever-free without medication 
for three days, their respiratory 
symptoms have improved and 
10 days have passed since their 
symptoms first appeared. Those 
exposed should also stay home 
for 14 days after they were 
exposed. More information from 
the University on quarnatining 
can be found here.

LSA sophomore Saad Shami 

said he expects the virus to 
spread on campus, in part due to 
the lack of testing for students 
living in off-campus housing. 

“With all the people living 

off campus, none of them were 
tested before they arrived on 
campus,” Shami said. “So I think 
it’s pretty likely that someone 
off campus, maybe even in my 
apartment complex, has COVID 
at the moment. So yeah, I’m 
definitely concerned about that 
for sure.”

Ringler-Cerniglia 
also 

stressed 
concerns 
about 

large, 
off-campus 
housing 

arrangements, such as Fraternity 
and Sorority Life housing, and 
said those living there need to 
take extra precautions. 

“Certainly those situations 

where there’s a large number 
of people in direct contact 
do present that possibility of 
quickly 
spreading,” 
Ringler-

Cerniglia said. “It’s all the 
more important for them to be 
very conscious of additional 
socializing. 
Certainly, 
that 

would fall under the concerns we 
have about congregate housing 
and partying or socializing and 
spreading cases even further.” 

Parties at off-campus houses 

were 
seen 
around 
campus 

Sunday through Tuesday by 
multiple Daily reporters.

Even 
if 
the 
Health 

Department can sustain case-
by-case 
investigations, 
many 

community 
members 
are 

worried 600 rooms will not be 
enough for everyone who tests 
positive for COVID-19 or who 
has ‘sustained personal contact’ 
with someone who tests positive 
for the virus. As of fall 2019, 
the University’s Ann Arbor 
campus had a total enrollment of 
approximately 48,000 students, 
with approximately two-thirds 
of undergraduates living off-
campus. 

When asked about concerns 

that 600 beds would not be 
enough, Broekhuizen explained 
how that number was generated. 

“The 
600 
bed 
capacity 

was determined based upon 
benchmark comparison with 
similar-sized peer institutions,” 
Broekhuizen said. 

After one week of in-person 

classes at the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 
there were only four rooms left 
available in the dorm used to 
quarantine students who were 
close contacts of people who 
tested positive for COVID-19. 

Burnstein, who will be living 

in a co-op this year, expressed 
concern over how the virus will 
spread through co-ops, similar 
to how many have been worried 
about the safety of FSL housing. 

He said students in co-ops 

have to do chores, and one of the 
additional chores at his co-op is 
sanitizing doorknobs. But “that’s 
the extent of the changes that 
are being made to the lifestyle of 
those who are in the co-ops.”

“I really think that a lot 

of attention will be paid to 
Greek 
life 
but 
not 
nearly 

enough attention will be paid 
to co-ops,” Burnstein said. “In 
my experience, at least in the 
last couple of weeks, they’ve 
signaled that they’ve done very, 
very little to prepare the houses 
and the students for you know, 
COVID in the fall.” 

Rackham student Paul Rizik 

disagreed. He moved into a 
co-op last week and lived in 
Inter-Cooperative 
Council 

housing prior to the COVID-19 
pandemic. He said there have 
been 
numerous 
changes 
to 

procedures to protect students 
from contracting the virus. 

“We no longer have communal 

meals (and) we have assigned 
bathrooms to minimize people’s 
exposure,” Rizik wrote in an 
email to The Daily. “We have 
a house policy dictating that 
everyone has to wear masks 
in public spaces until 2 weeks 
into the semester, and every 
cleaning chore I’ve done has 
taken nearly twice the amount 
of time it did before I left, since 
people’s standards are so much 
higher.” 

According to Sarah Kathleen 

Garcia, ICC’s vice president for 
finance, the ICC has assembled 
a COVID-19 task force to 
meet weekly and discuss how 
members can best be kept 
safe. She added that houses 
have taken various actions to 
limit the spread of the virus, 
including 
quarantining 
new 

members and requiring masks 
in common areas. Currently, 
Garcia said, the ICC dictates 
each house must discuss their 
guest policy at a general meeting 
as soon as possible and no guests 
are allowed during the move-in 
period.

Pizza Bob’s moves to new location on S. State Street

After more than 50 years of 

operation at its original location, 
Pizza Bob’s will find a new home 
this Tuesday just 110 feet north 
at 800 S. State Street. The new 
location, previously home to Red 
Light Cafe, will offer both indoor 
and outdoor seating.

According 
to 
owner 
Pam 

Pietryga, the move was largely 
motivated 
by 
a 
desire 
for 

more space. The seating in the 
original location was limited 
to a front counter and a single 
round table, whereas the new 
location offers space for both 
indoor and outdoor dining while 
maintaining appropriate social 
distancing. Pietryga plans to use 
the basement of the restaurant to 
host larger parties when COVID-
19 restrictions no longer apply.

The 
space 
also 
makes 

it 
possible 
for 
one 
of 
the 

restaurant’s most well-known 
items, the Chipati sauce, to be 
prepared in-house. The owners 

had previously rented a kitchen 
in Ypsilanti to make the sauce. 

Pietryga said another perk 

of the new building is its public 
bathroom, which the previous 
space lacked. She also hopes the 
placement at the stoplight on the 
corner will increase visibility 
and foot traffic.

Kailana 
Dejoie, 
LSA 

sophomore 
and 
Pizza 
Bob’s 

employee, is hopeful that the new 
location will improve business.

“I think it’s going to be a great 

development for Pizza Bob’s and I 
think it’s a good location in terms 
of the community too,” Dejoie 
said. “I know a lot of people were 
sad that we switched locations 
because that’s been there for 50 
plus years, but I think for the 
business it’s a good move.”

Pietryga said she plans to 

retain as many aspects of the 
original restaurant as possible 
in the new space, including 
its posters, frames, handmade 
signs and the plexiglass wall 
filled with postcards sent to Bob 
Marsh, the original cook and 
the restaurant’s namesake. The 

restaurant will also be painted in 
the original maize and blue color 
scheme, with plans to recreate 
the past location’s Pizza Bob’s 
mural.

“All 
the 
different 
things 

people come to notice and point 
out about Pizza Bob’s … we’re not 
forgetting any of that,” Pietryga 
said. “We’re taking as much with 
us, and trying to find a good 
way of displaying it, so that we 
always have that memory and 
history and stuff that people like 
to see.”

Pietryga said while it’s hard to 

say goodbye, the benefits of the 
larger space outweigh the losses.

“I think the customers are 

gonna like it much better because 
… with all the renovations done, 
we’re going to be able to seat 
more than we ever could, and 
then when all this passes and 
we’re all back into our normal 
life, we’ll definitely be able to 
enjoy the customer interaction,” 
Pietryga said. “We’ve missed 
that now, the past four months. 
One of the things we love about 
Pizza Bob’s is the camaraderie 

with the customers.”

Pietryga said Pizza Bob’s has 

been able to stay open during 
the pandemic due to the support 
of loyal Ann Arbor customers. 
According to Andy Lansing, a 
University of Michigan alum and 
Pizza Bob’s customer, it is this 
companionship that sets Pizza 

Bob’s apart.

“What makes it special is just 

that it is today what it’s always 
been,” Lansing said. “In a world 
of chain restaurants and a world 
of sort of similar concepts, 
similar styles of restaurants, I 
think Pizza Bob’s is a mountain 
of its own… I think that the 

environment and just their style 
of service is really special and 
there’s something about it that’s 
really magical — and of course, 
the sauce.”

Challengers swept incumbents 

in the Aug. 4 primary election for 
open seats in each of the five wards 
on the Ann Arbor City Council. 
Each 
candidate 
is 
currently 

running unopposed in the Nov. 3 
general election and will take office 
later that month. 

The Daily spoke with Lisa Disch 

of Ward 1, Linh Song of Ward 2, 
Travis Radina of Ward 3, Jen Eyer 
of Ward 4 and Erica Briggs of Ward 
5 to discuss their reflections on 
their campaigns during a summer 
of an unabating pandemic and civil 
unrest, as well as their priorities 
when inaugurated in November.

Lisa Disch, D-Ward 1
As a University of Michigan 

professor 
in 
political 
science 

and women and gender studies, 
Disch said she will bring a unique 
perspective to city council after 
her inauguration. In an email to 
The Daily, Disch wrote she feels 
very lucky to have the opportunity 
to regularly interact with students 
who 
bring 
different 
political 

viewpoints into the classroom.

“I have developed skills of 

communication 
and 
habits 
of 

listening and working in the 
classroom that I hope will make me 
a more effective representative,” 
Disch wrote. “I’ve also always 
thought that my job is more about 
learning things than it is about 
knowing and ‘professing’ them. 
This is a political moment when 
openness to learning in the face of 
unprecedented challenges might be 
a very good thing to have.”

Disch wrote she was excited 

about her win considering it was 
her first time as a candidate. 

“Nobody does systematic polling 

in an election like this one, and 
my excellent campaign manager 
and advisors had warned me 
throughout the campaign that 
Council elections are often very 
close,” Disch wrote. “I can honestly 
say that the results surprised me 
and my team — and thrilled us.”

On 
her 
platform, 
Disch 

cites urban and environmental 
stewardship, civic engagement and 
safety as some of her top priorities. 

Disch wrote she wants to 

improve the tone of council 
meetings and work collaboratively 
with other council members to put 
problem-solving ahead of personal 
and political differences. She plans 
to push for more affordable housing 
and the redevelopment of North 
Main Street.

“There 
are 
many 
pressing 

issues in Ward 1 that I want to be 
prepared to take up right away 
with staff,” Disch wrote. “Such as 
traffic management on residential 
roads like Pontiac Trail and 
Barton Drive that have become 
major commuter through-ways, 
and implementing the parts of the 
City’s sustainability plan that help 
reduce the disproportionately high 
costs of energy for lower-income 
households.”

Disch said the unavailability of 

affordable housing intersects with 
so many other challenges that Ann 
Arbor faces.

“It means that too many people 

in Washtenaw County are paying 
too much of their incomes for 
rent and that too many people are 
commuting too far to their jobs,” 
Disch wrote. “It is a top priority 
for me because it is a contributing 
factor to economic stratification, to 
structural racism and to the climate 
crisis.”

Linh Song, D-Ward 2
Throughout Song’s campaign 

for a seat on council in Ward 2, 
which her former opponent Jane 
Lumm first held in 1993-1998 and 
again from 2011 to the present, 
Song emphasized Ann Arbor’s 
national ranking as the eighth 
most 
economically 
segregated 

community in the U.S. As the Black 
Lives Matter movement swept 
the nation with renewed energy 
following the killing of several 
Black men and women at the hands 
of police, Song said her campaign 
shifted gears from an emphasis on 
affordable housing to focusing on 
issues of racial justice.

“So if I keep saying, ‘We are 

the eighth most economically 
segregated community in the U.S.,’ 
that’s what we’re talking about: 
that history of racial economic 
segregation,” Song said. “And we 
need to own up to it.”

Song said knowledge of Ann 

Arbor’s racial history — from 
restrictive housing covenants to 
the political pushback following 
the election of Ann Arbor’s first and 
only Black mayor Albert Wheeler — 
must guide any conversations about 
the future of the city, including 
conversations around affordable 
housing and policing. In 2014, police 
officer David Ried fatally shot Aura 
Rosser, a Black woman living in Ann 
Arbor, and faced no charges. This 
prompted protests and the creation 
of a police oversight commission. 

Mark Bernstein and Shauna 

Ryder Diggs, both Democratic 
incumbents and University of 
Michigan alum, were nominated 
to defend their seats on the 
University’s Board of Regents 
at 
the 
Michigan 
Democratic 

Convention this weekend. Both 
have served as regents since 2012. 

U.S. 
Rep. 
Rashida 
Tlaib, 

D-Mich., 
spoke 
to 
nominate 

Bernstein, 
while 
University 

Regent Denise Ilitch spoke to 
nominate Ryder Diggs.

In a video posted online earlier 

this month, Bernstein detailed 
his previous work as a University 
regent, including advocating for 
making college more affordable.

“It is an honor to have run and 

won eight years ago with my friend 
Shauna Ryder Diggs,” Bernstein 
said. “We’re eager to continue 
serving as Democratic regents 
at the University of Michigan … 
 

As a regent, I have aggressively 
advanced our Democratic vision 
for affordable, accessible and 
excellent public higher education, 
while 
embracing 
diversity, 

honoring labor and protecting the 
environment.”

In another prerecorded video, 

Ryder Diggs also discussed the 
importance of college affordability, 
noting her own experience with 
student loans.

“As a daughter of two university 

professors, I believe in the power 
of higher education to improve the 

lives of us all,” Ryder Diggs said. 
“I’m a physician in solo private 
practice, and I attended Michigan 
for college, medical school and 
residency. 
Those 
years 
were 

wonderful and I built long lasting 
friendships and was trained by 
the best doctors in the nation, but 
they were costly. Even when my 
family supported me, I still had to 
take out large loans to pay for this 
extraordinary education.”

Ryder 
Diggs 
emphasized 

several policy issues she has 
focused on over the past eight 
years, 
including 
support 
for 

more equitable funding across all 
three University campuses and 
organized labor. 

“I believe in the power of 

collective 
bargaining,” 
Ryder 

Diggs said. “That is why I’ll 
continue to support the faculty 
and staff doing the work on a daily 
basis … but there is still much more 
work to be done.”

The two will appear on the 

ballot for the general election in 
November.

According to campaign finance 

documents filed prior to the 
convention, Bernstein’s campaign 
has raised a total of $25,964.25 in 
contributions and other receipts. 
Of that, $20,000 came from a 
direct 
contribution 
Bernstein 

made to his own campaign on Aug. 
3.

Meanwhile, Diggs’ campaign 

had a total of $4,799.65 in 
contributions and other receipts. 
On Aug. 19, Diggs reported a late 
contribution of $2,500 to her 
campaign.

While both are Democrats, they 

have not been in lockstep with one 
another in their time as Regents.

Over the summer, as the Board 

debated a tuition increase to help 
the University deal with a budget 
crunch brought on by the COVID-
19 pandemic, Diggs voted against 
the initial budget proposal while 
Bernstein 
supported 
it. 
That 

proposal, which failed with a split 
vote, would have increased tuition 
across all three campuses while 
providing additional funding for 
the Flint and Dearborn campuses.

The move drew swift criticism 

from students, who argued that 
classes will not be as valuable 
as they would be under normal, 
pre-pandemic circumstances and 
that the heightened monetary 
burden was a blow to people facing 
financial straits of their own.

At another meeting several days 

later to consider a new budget 
proposal, Diggs and Bernstein 
maintained their initial positions: 
Diggs voting no and Bernstein 
voting yes. That budget passed 
in a 5-2 vote and included a 1.9 
percent increase in tuition for 
the Ann Arbor campus; a 3.9 
percent increase for UM-Flint 
and UM-Dearborn; a 1.9 percent 
increase in room and board fees 
and a $50 COVID-19 student fee.

In 
February, 
Bernstein 

announced the Board of Regents 
would reevaluate the University’s 
policy on investing in fossil fuel, 
freezing any new investments 
during that time. The decision 
followed 
months 
of 
public 

commenters 
highlighting 
the 

threat of climate change and the 
University’s 
responsibility 
to 

combat it.

At that same meeting, Bernstein 

also advocated for ensuring that 
major capital projects undertaken 
by the University align with 
its goal of achieving carbon 
neutrality by 2030.

In 
December 
2019, 
when 

the Climate Action Movement 
and One University members 
expressed frustration at a lack of 
direct response from the Board 
regarding climate change, Diggs 
was the only Regent to respond 
to their questions. She noted that 
the Regents do take into account 
public commenters’ arguments 
and sympathize with their views. 

Bernstein’s efforts to support 

the University have not always 
been well received. In July 
2016, he withdrew a $3 million 
donation he had made to the new 
Trotter Multicultural Center due 
to concerns about naming the 
building after Bernstein.

The 
Trotter 
Multicultural 

Center, which honors activist 
and newspaper editor William 
Monroe Trotter, is the only 
building on campus named after 
an African American. Bernstein 
said his intention was not to 
minimize Trotter’s legacy, adding 
that the decision came after 
feedback from the University 
community.

Local eatery expands seating with increased space; owner says move will allow restaurant to accommodate more patrons 

PENNY LAM/Daily

Pizza Bob’s, a popular spot for U-M students, will move to a different location on S. State St this coming Tuesday.


When we conceptualize 

our nation as an ecosystem, 
our national and societal 
wounds — and their urgent 
need for repair — become 
deeply 
apparent. 
Despite 

this dire need for healing, 
it is also society’s responsi-
bility to strive toward that 
reparation — to strive to 
nourish, to thrive effective-
ly and efficiently. Michigan 
in Color’s was established 
in pursuit of healing and 
education. And while we 
attempt to distinguish our-
selves as a section, we must 
continue with dignity and 
unwavering 
reclamation: 

The kind of resonance we 
can use to amplify your sen-
timents, stories, ideas and 
truth — inspiring a com-
munity understanding and 
safety. A creation of a new 
form of justice. 

Despite society’s superfi-

cial attempts to placate peo-
ple of color, this space was 
created to actualize empow-
erment and flourishing in a 
nurturing community until 
these safe spaces are not an 
abnormality, but an expec-
tation.

The people have shown 

us the amount of revolu-
tion that can happen in just 
a few short months. They 
have further elucidated— 
there exists a dire need for a 
nuanced approach to politi-
cal and social movements, 
with knowledge of our his-
torical 
past 
championed 

by the minority. We have 
learned 
that 
revolutions 

begin with education. We 
intend to start off the year 
on that note and ensure that 
the movement lives unapol-
ogetically in our work. To 
our amazing summer man-
aging 
editors, 
Gabrijela 

Skoko and Cheryn Hong, we 
thank you for bringing the 
fire and diligence to MiC 
that allowed this section to 
be a platform for that educa-
tion, and we thank all of our 
amazing writers for provid-
ing us with content that 
could enlighten week after 
week. Let’s keep it rolling. 

Michigan 
in 
Color 
is 

an entity whose work is 
grounded in ancestral and 
world knowledge, pursuing 
and springboarding valu-
able change with empathy 
and unity. In everything we 
do, we hope to inspire oth-
ers to center intersectional 
voices, injustices and sys-
tems of oppression in order 
to properly establish a route 
toward restorative justice. 
In doing this, one will inevi-
tably learn about the sur-
prisingly universal ways in 
which we have all experi-
enced life; we are not as dif-
ferent as we may proclaim 
to be. The colonial violence 
that oppresses Black peo-
ple in America is the same 
that oppresses Palestinians 
across the ocean, is the same 
that separates immigrant 
families at the border, is 
the same that draws district 
lines and upholds systemic 

poverty and mass incar-
ceration. It is intolerable, if 
not deplorable, that a small 
fraction of the population, 
the billionaire elite, are 
given the power to destroy 
and exploit the environment 
to the exponential degree 
that they have. The voices 
we give a platform to in our 
space are voices of change, 
ones that have experienced 
some degree of oppression 
and who work to actively 
deconstruct 
the 
systems 

perpetuating that oppres-
sion. These voices and our 
editors strive to empower 
individuals and bridge com-
munities, but most impor-
tantly and overwhelmingly 
to incite transformation, to 
incite revolution. 

This is a call to action. 

A call to join the ceaseless 
fight until all of our commu-
nities have the same access 
to opportunity that we have 
as students at this Univer-
sity. A call to requiring and 
demanding 
dignity 
and 

respect as a human right. To 
expose and dispose of sys-
tems and mechanisms that 
use “—the consistent appli-
cation of violent solutions 
to nonviolent, and often 
nonexistent, 
problems.” 

Michigan in Color needs 
your energy and your art, 
your peace and your pres-
ence, not only as tangible 
documentation of our dis-
satisfactions, but also of our 
jubilations. 

To the university and to 

communities across cam-
pus, it is not enough to be 
aware. “Don’t you see the 
plants, the birds, the spi-
ders and bees going about 
their individual tasks, put-
ting the world in order, as 
best as they can? And you’re 
not willing to do your job as 
a human being? Why aren’t 
you running to do what your 
nature demands;” why is it 
radical to demand what our 
nature inclines?

We urge all readers to con-

tinue to learn and unlearn. 
Continue to question the 
systems that we are volun-
tarily and involuntarily a 
part of. Continue to read-
just your lens when a new 
angle is presented — having 
the difficult conversations 
along with the joyful ones. 

We urge all artists, all 

creators to continue shar-

7-Opinion

Opinion

I 

rubbed the sleep out of 
my eyes and reached 
through the darkness for 

my phone. It was 4 a.m. on a 
March 2020 morning and the 
screams coming from outside 
my apartment were making 
it impossible to sleep. I sat 
up and looked down from my 
second-story window to the 
thin road below. Bathed in 
the orange light of a street 
lamp a group of people were 
dancing in a circle, their 
maniacal laughs and screams 
echoing up and down the 
otherwise silent street. While 
this 
alone 
wouldn’t 
have 

made it a notable event on the 
famously raucous Greenwood 
Avenue, the fact that this 
group of dancers was wearing 
nothing but their smiles was 
a little too crazy even for this 
party-street. But I was hardly 
surprised.

Ann Arbor had been abuzz 

with massive parties for days 
on end. After a student tested 
positive for COVID-19 and 
classes were canceled, many 
rushed to party with their 
friends and enjoy one final 
week of college life before 
returning home. Despite the 
University and public health 
experts telling us to remain 
in our dorms and apartments, 
on every block, from sunup 
to sundown, a party seemed 
to rage. Adding to the danger 
of the situation, University 
students had just returned 
from spring break a week 
earlier, likely bringing more 
than 
just 
souvenirs 
and 

wicked hangovers back to 
Michigan. 

A 
few 
weeks 
after 

witnessing this naked dance 
party in the middle of my 
street, Michigan, particularly 
Detroit, had already gained 
the unwanted designation as a 
dreaded COVID-19 “hotspot.” 
Unlike most other American 
metropolises, 
citizens 
of 

the Motor City and other 
communities 
throughout 

southeast 
Michigan 
were 

uniquely vulnerable to this 
new 
respiratory 
disease. 

Like it had done in New 
Orleans a few weeks prior, the 
coronavirus took advantage 
of the states’ glaring legacies 
of racial and environmental 
injustice. 
While 
many 

nursing 
and 
senior living 

facilities were devastated by 
the disease, communities of 
color 
throughout 
southern 

Michigan 
were 
hit 
even 

harder. 
Of 
the 
1,000,000 

Black Michiganders tested for 
COVID-19, an average of over 
16,000 test positive. For white 
people, the positivity rate 
per million is only a fraction 
of this, at less than 6,000. 

Michiganders of color, as a 
consequence of generations 
of environmental racism, also 
find themselves significantly 
more likely to succumb to the 
disease. 

Heavily 
polluting 

industries, like the Marathon 
Oil refinery and trash burning 
facilities, have been allowed 
to nestle their ways into 
minority 
communities 
and 

dirty the air with government 
approval for decades. Filling 
the 
workplaces, 
hospitals 

and homes of Detroiters with 
stinking, chemical-filled air 
— unfit to breathe by anyone’s 
standards 
— 
has 
resulted 

in higher rates of chronic 
asthma. This, paired with 
less access to green areas, 
healthy foods and exercise 
facilities, is linked to other 
health problems later in life, 
like obesity and diabetes, 
which 
Black 
Michiganders 

also 
have 
higher 
rates 

of. 
The 
prevalence 
of 

preexisting 
conditions 
in 

these communities has had 
devastating effects.

Black 
Michiganders, 

despite making up less than 
14.5 percent of the state’s 
population, 
constitute 

nearly half of the total death 
count from COVID-19 and 
are four times more likely 
than 
individuals 
of 
other 

demographics to succumb to 
the virus. While the pandemic 
has shined an intense and 
tragic light on the effects 
of environmental injustice, 
public health officials have 
long been aware of them. Dr. 
Anthony Fauci, director of the 
National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases, said 
that he hopes the pandemic 
will be the wake-up call for 
America 
to 
narrow 
these 

inequalities. “We will get 
over Coronavirus, but there 
will still be health disparities, 
which we really do need 
to address in the African 
American community,” Fauci 
said. 

The University of Michigan’s 

Michigan Medicine, one of 
the most prestigious health 
institutions 
in 
the 
world, 

could 
play 
an 
essential 

role in this mission. With 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel himself a renowned 
immunologist, 
I 
at 
least 

expected our University to 
acknowledge the fact that 
our nation is not ready for 
in-person classes to resume. 
My street alone is littered 
with broken bottles, destroyed 
furniture, beer cans and red 
solo cups from the countless 
parties I saw there in just a 
two-day visit. The University 
could have chosen to be the 
role model on how to safely 
and 
innovatively 
adapt 
to 

yet 
another 
surmountable 

challenge 
in 
its 
203-year 

history. Instead, the school 
has chosen to endanger the 
very Michiganders it was 
founded to serve. 

With the pandemic still 

increasing in intensity in 
many parts of the country, the 
responsible move would be to 
make classes fully remote, 
encourage students to stay 
at home and avoid a highly 
predictable 
public 
health 

disaster. With students at 
many universities calling for 
tuition cuts for online classes, 
and some opportunistic ones 
even 
suing 
their 
schools, 

the University has instead 
bucked common sense and 
morality and has let greed 
become its guide. In the 
attitude of the multi-billion 
dollar corporation it often 
resembles, the University has 
chosen to ignore the health 
of Michiganders for money. 
Even worse, the effects of this 
dangerous choice will be felt 
disproportionately by Black 
communities. In wake of the 
Black Lives Matter movement, 
and 
with 
Michigan 
State 

University canceling classes 
two weeks ago, the fact the 
University is trying to feign 
ignorance that this choice 
will put thousands of Black 
lives at risk is inexcusable. 

By 
beckoning 
students 

back to Ann Arbor with this 
“hybrid semester,” the most 
brilliant minds in Michigan 
are tempting an explosion 
of coronavirus cases. With 
a 
massive 
student 
body, 

the Black communities of 
not only Ann Arbor and 
neighboring cities are at risk 
but all of southern Michigan. 
While it is impossible to 
say 
if 
Michigan 
students 

will 
resist 
the 
partying 

and irresponsible behavior 
that they fell prey to at the 
beginning of the pandemic, 
it’s difficult for me to get 
those glistening buttcheeks 
from March out of my head.

Why in-person classes are a racist mistake

RILEY DEHR | COLUMNIST

E

ditor’s Note: The author 
of this op-ed is a staff 
member at the University 

of Michigan. They have been kept 
anonymous due to their fear of 
retaliation.

Listening to the University 

of Michigan’s President Mark 
Schlissel for the last five months, I 
am shocked by the degree to which 
a Trump-like disregard for truth 
has overpowered our institution. In 
Donald Trump’s America, obvious 
lies are told without consequence, 
and unwelcome truths are silenced 
to avoid confronting inconvenient 
or 
unprofitable 
inevitabilities. 

Watching Schlissel mislead and 
lie to reopen the campus, I’ve 
asked myself: has truth become 
meaningless here, too? 

The answer is yes. For the 

past four years, I’ve held out 
hope that our institution could 
serve as a respite from the 
madness of Trumpian rule. I 
believe that despite its flaws, 
the university remains the most 
important institution in society 
for its contributions to freedom, 
democracy and reason. But I was 
wrong to believe we could avoid the 
deterioration and rot that has run 
through our country. Now Schlissel 
runs our college like Trump runs 
America: with dishonest impunity, 
at grave risk to us all.

President 
Schlissel 
often 

reminds us that he is a scientific 
authority. He told us we could 
reopen 
in-person 
“while 

maintaining the same level of 
safety we’d be experiencing if we 
were fully remote” and bragged 
that he has “the best research.” 
But he ignored requests from 
thousands of faculty, staff and 
students to see this “best research.” 
He refused to share the science 
behind his decision to call 30,000 
students from all corners of the 
world back to campus in the middle 
of an uncontrolled pandemic, even 
after admitting we lack sufficient 
testing capacity. 

President Schlissel said testing 

played a harmful role in the AIDS 
crisis, so we shouldn’t pursue 
more testing now. But a legendary 
AIDS activist called this the most 
egregious lie he’s heard this year.

President Schlissel demeaned 

worker demands for widespread 
testing as “science fiction” that 
was “not essential.” But a study 
out of Harvard and MIT said there 
was no way to prevent a near-
total outbreak without testing 
everyone on campus every two 
days. Another Harvard expert said 
Schlissel showed “a fundamental 
misunderstanding of the purpose 
of testing.”

President Schlissel proclaimed 

the 
University’s 
efforts 
were 

informed by our top public health 
experts. But a U-M respiratory 
infectious disease expert told 
The Michigan Daily that none of 
the colleagues she’s spoken with 
believe the University’s reopening 
plan is safe, and top experts 
nationwide 
harshly 
criticized 

Schlissel’s “lack of commitment to 
keep[ing] everybody safe.”

President 
Schlissel 
blamed 

students for forgetting their ethical 
responsibility to our community. 
His office placed culpability for 
controlling the virus’s spread 
squarely on their shoulders — if 
they didn’t avoid hooking up 
altogether, the outbreak would be 
their fault. But in July, his office 
failed to release a report from its 
own COVID-19 Ethics Committee 
that expressed “with urgency” 
that the U-M administration’s 
plans to reopen were unsafe and 
the negative consequences were 
predictable. 
The 
suppressed 

report leaked on social media in 
late August, after most students 
returned to campus.

President 
Schlissel 
lists 

diversity, equity and inclusion 
among his top priorities. But 
U-M’s Chief Diversity Officer sat 
on that ethics committee, and the 
suppressed 
report 
emphasized 

that “communities of color and 
other vulnerable people will be 
the hardest hit” by the University’s 
actions.

President Schlissel spoke of 

reducing law enforcement. But 
he supported a new policing 
program that formalized a city-
wide anonymous snitch system 
and expanded the mandate of the 
AAPD, which has still not been 
properly investigated for killing 
Aura Rosser. Similar programs 
elsewhere 
have 
been 
applied 

disproportionately on communities 
of color.

President Schlissel claimed he 

“didn’t know how to interpret” 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s call to 
all state universities to close their 
campuses and tell students to stay 
home. But her words were clear.

President Schlissel called U-M 

a “family.” But he admitted that 
the University may fire its most 
vulnerable staff members and 
dismissed the idea of using the 
$10 billion endowment to protect 
workers, 
asserting 
that 
new 

construction projects will take 
precedence over existing staff.

All of this provides plenty of 

reason to worry, but we now come 
to perhaps the most troubling 
development 
of 
all. 
President 

Schlissel 
said 
he 
is 
guided 

by U-M’s values as a public 
institution. But when the decision 
was made to reopen, U-M’s Board 
of Regents was chaired by one of 
Ann Arbor’s largest landlords, 
Ron Weiser — a billionaire Trump 
megadonor who has given more 
than $100M to U-M in the last 
six years. He closed a new $30M 
gift within days of U-M’s decision 
to reopen. In one of the biggest 
conflicts of interest imaginable 
between 
public 
health 
and 

private wealth, Weiser’s company 
McKinley, which he founded and 
of which he is majority owner, 
stands to take a financial hit if 
students didn’t come back and 
pay rent.

To sum things up, President 

Schlissel said this would be 
a 
“public 
health 
informed 

in-residence 
semester,” 
but 

the public health experts are 

upset and afraid. Thousands of 
community members are upset 
and afraid. And our megadonor 
landlord regent is satisfied that 
he’ll profit from the students told 
to return to campus by President 
Schlissel.

People will soon begin dying 

avoidable deaths from COVID-
19 and the University will be 
culpable. Why did it come to this? 
Thousands of us were shouting 
warnings 
and 
demanding 

answers all summer, but we were 
ignored, silenced, made to feel 
powerless in our isolation. 

Authoritarianism 
happens 

wherever an institution lacks 
the 
safeguards 
to 
hold 
its 

leadership accountable to facts. 
I would tell you we stand at the 
edge of authoritarianism, but 
the truth is we have crossed 
that line. In front of our noses, 
a tiny group that is supposed to 
serve us has consolidated power 
over the largest public research 
university in the world, rendered 
truth meaningless and led us 
into an avoidable public health 
disaster. To point out the obvious 
invites 
harsh 
punishment, 

so this editorial is published 
anonymously. Many of you will 
be too afraid to even share it 
publicly; such is the culture of 
fear these rulers have created. 
If we learn anything from this, 
I hope it’s that the current 
leadership model has and will 
continue to fail us when we need 
it most. 

Perhaps in hindsight, this 

public health failure is not so 
different 
from 
the 
repeated 

failures 
to 
diversify 
the 

university. Or the failures to 
contribute positively in Detroit. 
Or the failures of allowing 
top offices to be occupied by 
sexual predators. If we ousted 
President 
Schlissel 
tomorrow 

but did nothing to change the 
increasingly privatized model 
of public education, we should 
not be surprised when history 
repeats itself with even more 
devastating consequences.

We are out of time to save 

our community from the most 
immediate 
consequences 
of 

President 
Schlissel’s 
public 

health lies, but I still hold out 
hope for a better future. This 
university is composed not only 
of a few powerful people at the 
top, but of tens of thousands of 
committed students, faculty, staff 
and 
surrounding 
community 

members who care passionately 
about 
education, 
intellectual 

freedom, 
truth 
and 
justice. 

We can run the University 
collectively 
and 
sustainably 

by 
forming 
representative 

stakeholders’ associations that 
prevent anyone from making 
major 
decisions 
without 

justification or accountability. 
Together, we can better serve 
the interests of our students, our 
workers and our society.

Another university is possible. 

The necessity of building it has 
never been clearer.

I 

have 
real 
problems 

with my city and my 
university. It’s legal in 

Ann Arbor to gather outside 
in groups of 25 and inside in 
groups of 10. But it isn’t safe. 
The city also requires that we 
wear masks when in groups, 
but even that’s not safe unless 
we are six feet apart. And how 
easy is it to wear a mask when 
you’re having a drink and a 
conversation? 

My city — the city I came 

home to 10 years after I 
graduated from the University 
of Michigan — is not doing all 
it should to protect students. 

And our university? Well, I 

hate to admit it, but Michigan 
State University is behaving 
more 
responsibly 
on 
this 

one. They’ve opted to have 
all 
classes 
online, 
while 

our 
university 
is 
offering 

some in-person classes and 
students 
are 
flooding 
the 

campus. 

Full disclosure: I’m a senior 

citizen, which means this 
virus is more likely to kill 
me than it is to kill students. 
I live near campus with my 
husband and one of my sons. 
I have always loved living 
among students — it energizes 
me. Now, not so much. 

I grew up in New York and 

came to Michigan to go to the 
University. After graduating, 

I returned to the big city to 
do a doctorate at New York 
University. By the time I was 
finished, I was married to a 
Michigan guy, and we both 
missed Ann Arbor. We packed 
up and came home to our 
college town, and we’ve never 

regretted it. 

I love this city and this 

university, but I worry about 
the path we’re all on. Very 
few people get through this 
disease 
without 
suffering. 

If you’ve ever had the flu, 
imagine 
something 
much 

worse. And then there’s the 
possibility of dying, even for 
young people. 

Even 
though 
the 
virus 

may be more dangerous for 
old folks like me, it can do 
irreparable damage to you, 
sometimes in ways that can’t 
hurt me any more — the loss 
of fertility may be one of the 
long-term effects of suffering 
from this virus. Too little is 
known to be sure of that, but 
some of the consequences are 
so unknown they aren’t even 
being investigated yet.

So I’m asking you to consider 

being more responsible than 
the people making the rules 
around 
here. 
Wear 
masks 

whenever you’re out. Stand 
six feet away from others. Skip 
parties until there’s a vaccine. 
If you can opt to take your 
classes online, do that. 

This is a bummer. For all 

of us, but especially for you. I 
have wonderful memories of 
my college years, and social life 
was a major part of the college 
experience. I didn’t have to 
choose between connecting 
with friends and staying alive 
and healthy, and you shouldn’t 
have to either. But you do. 
And the choice should be easy 
enough, however painful. 

Stay safe. Stay well. And 

we’ll all meet again on the 
other side of this. 

B

eginning college is an 
exciting and stressful 
time for most students. 

The anticipation of a new 
town, new campus and new 
friends brings all kinds of 
feelings, a majority of which 
are happy ones. All too often 
this excitement is tainted by 
warnings of weight gain in 
the form of the “Freshman 
15.” 
Well-meaning 
older 

peers and family members 
warn you to “watch what 
you eat in the dining halls,” 
or outright suggest that you 
“don’t eat ‘x’ because you’ll 
gain weight,” as if such a 
biologically 
natural 
and 

necessary 
lifelong 
process 

is the worst thing that can 
happen to you. Well, I have 
news for you. Weight gain as 
a college student is natural, 
most 
times 
harmless 
and 

honestly, it should be the 
least of your concerns. The 
notion that weight gain stops 
at the age of 18 and that your 
teenaged high-school body 
is to be maintained for life 
needs to go.

Let’s breakdown the fear 

and anxiety that comes along 
with the dreaded “Freshman 
15” for what it really is — 
negative and anxious feelings 
toward weight gain as a result 
of a fatphobic society that has 
ingrained a mantra of “thin 
equals healthy and attractive” 
while 
being 
in 
a 
larger 

body is seen as unhealthy, 
undesirable 
and 
carries 

underlying 
assumptions 

about the person, namely that 
they are lazy. Yet, the fears 
surrounding this old myth 
are uncalled for.

Not only is the saying 

an exaggeration, with the 
average weight gain being 
2.5-3.5 pounds during the 
first year of college, it is also 
inaccurate to assume weight 
gain 
automatically 
equals 

unhealthy, 
overweight 
or 

“fat.” Even if one wanted to go 
by the BMI standard — which 
is misleading for its own 
reasons — a 2.5-pound weight 
gain, 
in 
the 
approximate 

average range, barely nudges 
one’s BMI. So, if you’re in the 
“healthy” category, odds are 
you’re going to remain right 
there. Even if one were to 
gain the “15 pounds” as the 
saying goes, it’s also entirely 
possible 
and 
common 
to 

remain within the “healthy” 
category. 
For 
example, 
a 

19-year-old female with a 
BMI of 21 can gain 15 pounds 
and end up at a BMI of 23.5 
which is still a “healthy” 
BMI, 
dependent 
on 
the 

height. However, I’d like to 
go beyond BMI since, as I 
said before, there are many 
reasons as to why it’s not an 
accurate measure of health. 

For one, the categories of 

“overweight” 
and 
“obese” 

are so ambiguous and lacking 
in evidence. In fact, in 1998, 
the categories changed, and 
as a result, millions became 
“overweight” 
or 
“obese” 

overnight 
— 
something 

the diet industry has made 
billions off of. Some may be 
shocked to learn that more 
studies 
are 
showing 
that 

being “overweight” can be 
perfectly healthy. A meta-
analysis of a bunch of studies 

found that individuals who 
are 
underweight 
have 
a 

greater risk of death than 
individuals falling under the 
“obese” category. 

Yet, 
no 
one 
criticizes 

very thin-bodied people the 
same way they do larger-
bodied folks. It’s actually 
the opposite — an immense 
glorification of very thin-
bodied people that more often 
than not is praise toward an 
eating disorder or disordered 
eating behaviors. So, this 
supposedly 
“well-intended” 

advice given to young adults 
under the guise of “health” 
does 
nothing 
to 
support 

health since health is not a 
number. 

The Health at Every Size 

(HAES) 
movement, 
which 

encompasses the principles of 
Intuitive Eating, is growing 
and so is the research backing 
it. 
If 
anything, 
warnings 

against 
the 
“Freshman 

15” are way more hurtful 
than helpful and send diet 
culture messages that weight 
gain is inherently bad and 
unattractive — that we should 
actively be trying to suppress 
our body weight or pursue 
weight loss. No wonder eating 
disorders 
and 
disordered 

eating behaviors are rampant 
on campuses. 

What’s 
most 
frustrating 

about 
the 
“Freshman 
15” 

message is the assumption 
that the weight you are at on 
the day of your high school 
graduation is somehow the 
weight you must be at during 
college, 
and 
pretty 
much 

the rest of your life. This is 
absolutely 
absurd. 
Young 

adults are actively growing 
and 
developing 
well 
into 

their mid-20s, so ill-advised 
measures projected on them 
to suppress their body weight 
do much more harm and zero 
good.

Furthermore, 
more 

research in support of set 
point 
theory 
has 
come 

forward, 
supporting 
the 

theory’s belief that every 
individual 
has 
a 
pre-

disposed set weight range in 
which their body functions 
optimally, and the body will 
actively fight to maintain 
this range. This is not to say 
that everyone’s setpoints will 
abide by the BMI standards. 
It would be foolish to think 
that every unique individual 
should 
be 
in 
a 
certain 

BMI range because that’s 
what’s healthiest for them. 
Who are we, as a society, 

to 
determine 
that? 
Some 

people’s 
setpoint 
ranges 

are 
within 
the 
“healthy” 

category, and plenty of others 
are within the “underweight” 
or “overweight” categories. 
In terms of those in the 
“underweight” 
group 

specifically, the difference 
here 
is 
that 
one 
whose 

natural set weight range is 
in this category maintains 
their weight without effort, 
meaning 
without 
dietary 

restriction and/or the abuse of 
exercise to keep that weight. 
Even if they purposefully 
pushed themselves to overeat 
for a period of time, it would 
be just as unsustainable as is 
undereating for a period of 
time (cough, cough, diet).

So, what to do? Surely, 

there must be some nutrition 
advice people must abide by, 
and surely, we must exercise. 
Well, yes and no. The forceful 
mindset of this statement is all 
wrong. What almost everyone 
gets wrong about the HAES 
movement is that it promotes 
obesity, and not only permits 
but encourages people to eat 
“junk” foods 24/7 and never 
exercise again. That couldn’t 
be farther from the truth. 
The 
movement 
champions 

the idea that one can pursue 
health 
at 
any 
weight 
by 

listening to their body and 
eating intuitively. Our bodies 
crave balance by nature, so 
while some may find they 
crave the calorically dense 
foods deemed “unhealthy” 
by society on some days, 
accepting that craving and 
meeting it is the best thing 
to 
do, 
and 
often 
results 

in the body craving more 
traditionally nutritious foods 
at other times. Full body trust 
is crucial. 

HAES 
also 
encourages 

people to partake in physical 
movement that they enjoy 
and that feels good. By taking 
a step away from mainstream 
fitness (and diet) culture, 
which 
pushes 
“working 

out” on people as something 
they have to do on the daily, 
movement 
becomes 
more 

appealing 
and 
enjoyable. 

It’s no longer confined to 
a 
gym 
or 
high-pressure 

environment. 
Instead, 
it 

includes walks or hikes with 
friends or playing tennis with 
a partner. All in all, if health 
is one’s true concern, then 
focusing on a number on a 
scale is a micro piece of the 
puzzle and largely irrelevant. 
Most 
times, 
it 
leads 
to 

poorer health as a result 
of 
unsustainable 
dieting 

measures. The best thing to 
target is behaviors, and that’s 
exactly what HAES supports 
by encouraging people to tune 
into their individual body’s 
needs and explore movement, 
with the goal to adopt healthy 
movement as an enjoyable, 
recurring practice. 

The healthiest thing for 

us college students, then, 
is to skip over the years of 
pointless 
and 
unhealthy 

dieting entirely and start 
practicing the principles of 
HAES and Intuitive Eating 
now.

W

ith 
the 
end 
of 

summer 
drawing 

near, 
many 

students, faculty and staff 
fearfully 
anticipate 
the 

repercussions 
of 
University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel’s 

vague and impractical plan 
for a public health-informed 
fall semester. Beside basic 
measures such as increasing 
social distancing in classrooms, 
requiring face masks on all 
campus grounds and offering 
a great number of online 
courses, few concrete steps 
have been taken to repress a 
COVID-19 outbreak on any 
of the three University of 
Michigan campuses. Schlissel 
himself stated that much of the 
reopening plan is dependent 
on students following public 
health guidelines, which — as 
we’ve seen as students begin to 
move back to Ann Arbor — is 
unlikely to happen. Despite the 
University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill moving classes 
online after one week and 
Central Michigan University 
increasing their case numbers 
tenfold within the first week 
of classes, both due to student 
behavior, Schlissel somehow 
still believes that our campuses 
will have a different result. 

It 
could 
be 
considered 

flattering 
that 
Schlissel 
is 

outwardly shows such strong 
faith in the student body. 
However, this outlook assumes 
that the immunologist running 
one of the world’s best public 
universities 
is 
naive 
and 

ignorant enough to believe 
his students, who have been 
partying 
throughout 
the 

summer, are suddenly going 
to stop. In his most recent 
announcement to the University 
of Michigan community, he 
implied that students who don’t 
follow public health guidelines 
will 
be 
to 
blame 
if 
the 

University is forced to revert to 
online-only classes. Placing the 
responsibility on the students to 
follow public health guidelines 
upon 
returning 
to 
campus 

is an attempt to scapegoat 
the student body so that the 
administration cannot be held 
accountable 
for 
triggering 

the inevitable viral outbreak. 
While any student who hosts 
or attends a party with more 
than 25 people is culpable for 
whatever consequences that 
gathering has on their campus 
or surrounding communities, 
the University administration 

is still at fault for enabling 
them.

If the University had any true 

intent to keep our campuses 
open throughout the upcoming 
school year, there would be 
explicitly stated and properly 
severe consequences for any 
student found to be violating 
public health guidelines. There 
would be a plan for rigorous 
asymptomatic testing of the 
entire campus throughout the 
semester. Every single course 
would have the option to be 
taken online. All students living 
in dorms would live in single 
rooms and be provided with 
adequate personal protective 
equipment. Bathrooms would 
have 
plexiglass 
between 

sinks. Any and all testing and 
COVID-19 related treatment 
for students, staff and faculty 
living on any of the three U-M 
campuses would be paid for by 
the University. These demands 
are included in a petition 
created 
by 
#NotMICampus, 

a coalition of students from 
various 
universities 
in 
the 

state of Michigan demanding 
changes 
in 
problematic 

reopening plans arising from 
their schools. The petition can 
be found here, and I strongly 
urge 
anybody 
concerned 

about the University’s current 
reopening plan to sign it. 

Still, if the administration 

truly cared about the well-

being of its students, staff 
and faculty as well as the 
communities that host our 
campuses, classes would have 
already been moved online for 
the upcoming semesters. In 
fact, there would not have been 
a plan for in-person classes in 
the first place. The university 
with a leading School of Public 
Health would have lived up to its 

“Leaders and the Best” slogan 
by leading the transition into 
an entirely online education 
throughout the rest of this 
pandemic. There would not 
have been a 1.9 percent tuition 
increase but rather a reduction 
in tuition for all three campuses 
to compensate for the lack of 
university facilities being used 
throughout the school year. 
The 
administration 
would 

have dipped into its massive 
endowment fund in order to 
provide financial support to 
its students, staff and faculty 
throughout 
the 
recession 

triggered by the COVID-19 
pandemic. Each of the demands 
arising from the University’s 
ResStaff, 
the 
residential 

advisors 
and 
employees 
of 

University Housing, would be 
met and respected. Students, 
who were forced to pay a $50 
COVID-19 fee for a safety kit 
whether they were returning 
to campus or not, would not 
be required to pick up said kit 
in person during limited time 
windows. 
The 
University’s 

COVID-19 Emergency Fund, 
funded by the Coronavirus Aid 
Relief and Economic Security 
Act, would be more widely 
advertised and accessible. 

At this point, it’s nearly 

impossible to argue that the 
University 
is 
still 
moving 

forward 
with 
its 
current 

reopening plan with the health 
and safety of its students, staff 
and faculty in mind. Schlissel 
and 
his 
administration 

are 
likely 
aware 
of 
how 

problematic their current plan 
is but are still moving forward 
with it — even their own 
COVID-19 Ethics and Privacy 
Committee explicitly stated 
its disapproval in a statement 
released on July 31. In order 
to take action, we must sign 
the #NotMICampus petition, 
sign and share this petition 
that demands the cancellation 
of 
in-person 
classes 
and 

email the President’s Office 
(presoff@umich.edu) 
explaining our disdain for the 
current plans. Additionally, 
those who are willing and 
able to continue protesting 
must do so. If enough people 
put 
this 
pressure 
on 
the 

administration, the University 
may just do something about it.

Until then, stay safe Ann 

Arbor.

O

ver the next couple 
of weeks, universities 
across 
the 
United 

States 
will 
welcome 
back 

faculty, staff and students 
in the midst of the recent 
and 
sustained 
national 

surge in COVID-19 cases. 
The 
University 
of 
North 

Carolina, University of Notre 
Dame, North Carolina State 
University 
and 
University 

of Alabama showed us the 
dangers of bringing students 
back in this environment. 
Over 100 students have tested 
positive for COVID-19 within 
the first week of classes at all 
four universities. Like Notre 
Dame and NC State, UNC 
responded to the growing 
public-health crisis by going 
fully remote for this semester. 
Faculty, staff and students 
had 
made 
this 
demand 

for 
months, 
vociferously 

opposing UNC’s reopening 
plan and condemning the 
administration’s 
initial 

responses to early COVID-19 
outbreaks on campus.

Here in Ann Arbor, the 

University 
of 
Michigan 

continues 
to 
plan 
for 

in-person, hybrid and remote 
courses. University Housing 
aims to fill residences at about 
75 percent capacity while 
requiring only one COVID-
19 test before move-in, as 
well as an opt-in surveillance 
testing scheme for residents. 
In a town hall, University 
President Mark Schlissel told 
the community, “I wish you 
could see the scientific basis 
of our decisions” about the 
reopening plans. His Ethics 
and 
Privacy 
Committee 

Report said the University 
“has a substantial obligation 

to help students, students’ 
families, faculty, and staff 
be aware of (i) the actual, 
evolving health risks … and 
(iii) our actual and projected 
levels of success, as best we 
can gauge them.” 

The Graduate Employees’ 

Organization, 
Lecturers’ 

Employee 
Organization, 

tenure track faculty and staff 
have all requested access to 
the 
modeling 
and 
reports 

that informed the Fall plans. 
Yet, 
U-M 
administrators 

still refuse to release them. 
The University has chosen 
not to enter any meaningful 
dialogue with its workers 
and students by excluding 
them 
from 
the 
decision-

making process and hiding 
information from them about 
the risks we are walking into 
in a few weeks. 

Since May, GEO has been 

asking 
to 
be 
included 
in 

decisions, starting with an 
open letter signed by over 
1,800 members of the U-M 
community. For over four 
months, U-M failed to address 
any 
of 
the 
demands 
and 

actually withheld information 
on reopening from the entire 
community until late June. 
In response, faculty members 
petitioned for the ability to 
opt-out of in-person teaching 
without penalties. At the time 
of publication, they gained 612 
signatures. Shortly thereafter, 
staff circulated a petition, 
gaining 
261 
signatures, 

requesting that “all staff … be 
given equal opportunity and 
full autonomy to determine 
whether 
they 
return 
to 

campus or continue to work 
remotely.” 
The 
University 

has not publicly responded. 

Despite 
the 
calls 
for 

transparency, inclusion and 
choice in the reopening plans, 
the University continues to 
ignore its entire community. 

This blatant disregard for 

public health and people’s 
lives has led all spheres of 
the U-M community to come 
together in opposition to the 
University’s reopening plan. 
Our calls for remote teaching, 
increased 
testing 
capacity 

and 
overall 

transparency 
are designed to 
ensure the safety 
of 
the 
entire 

U-M community, 
including 
the 

year-round 
residents of Ann 
Arbor, 
Flint 

and 
Dearborn. 

Instead, 
the 

University’s 
poor 
leadership 

has resulted in 
departments 
— 

like the Stamps 
School of Art & 
Design — forcing 
new 
students 
to 
commit 

to 
being 
in-person, 
and 

assigning mostly lecturers, 
several of them new to the 
school, to teach those classes 
regardless of the instructors’ 
preferences. 
Lecturers 
are 

both being put at high risk 
for contracting COVID-19 and 
are being laid off in alarming 
frequency — 41 percent of 
lecturers on the University 
of 
Michigan-Flint 
campus 

were laid off this summer. 
The University has made the 
conscious decision to force 
in-person classes down the 
throats of the communities 

it serves in a haphazard and 
secretive manner.

In 
addition, 
University 

Housing forced all residents 
to sign an amendment that 
gives 
the 
University 
the 

authority to evict positive 
COVID-19 
residents 
and 

protects the University from 
any liability at the same time. 
If that weren’t enough, the 
University’s Board of Regents 

approved a 1.9 
percent tuition 
increase 
at 

Ann 
Arbor 

and 
Dearborn 

campuses 
and 
a 
3.9 

percent tuition 
increase 
for 

Flint 
campus, 

as well as a $50 
COVID-19 
fee 

for all enrolled 
students. 

The 
reality 

remains 
that 

universities 
knew 
about 

COVID-
19 
for 
over 

five 
months 

before they released their 
reopening 
plans. 
There 

was time to engage with 
GEO, 
LEO, 
faculty, 
staff, 

students 
and 
parents 
in 

a 
transparent 
manner. 

In 
particular, 
President 

Schlissel 
called 
testing 

the entire U-M community 
“science fiction,” which he 
justified by reiterating an old, 

homophobic and inaccurate 

claim about HIV testing — 
we 
shouldn’t 
test 
people 

because “testing can give you 
a false sense of security. That 
happened in the HIV epidemic 
when people got a negative 

test 
and 
presented 
it 
to 

their sex partner and spread 
(the) 
disease 
nonetheless.” 

Contrary to this statement, 
regular 
and 
asymptomatic 

testing is an essential part of 
HIV public health.

COVID-19 remains fairly 

controlled 
in 
Michigan 

compared 
to 
other 
parts 

of 
the 
country. 
But 
the 

University’s reopening plan 
could quickly undo that, as 
the Ann Arbor Public School 
Board 
noted 
when 
they 

decided to go fully online 
because of the University’s 
reckless reopening plan. Not 
only is the reopening plan 
unsafe and unjust, but it is 
dangerous, potentially deadly 
and puts all residents of Ann 
Arbor, Dearborn and Flint 
at risk. This is yet another 
strain on the not always rosy 
relationship between the U-M 
community and the permanent 
residents of Ann Arbor: City 
Councilmember Julie Grand 
noted the increased tension 
the 
University’s 
decisions 

have 
created 
within 
this 

relationship, stating, “I don’t 
like that this (reopening plan) 
pits students against people 
living in the community.”

At 
this 
point 
in 
the 

pandemic, 
the 
University 

knows that COVID-19 will 
kill faculty, staff, students 
and 
their 
families 
and 

neighbors. 
If 
someone 

survives the disease, there 
remains about a 33 percent 
chance of “prolonged illness 
even 
among 
persons 
with 

milder 
outpatient 
illness, 

including young adults.” All 
of this led to Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer calling for all public 
universities 
to 
not 
bring 

their students back in the 
fall due to the pandemic and 
likelihood 
of 
in-residence 

semesters 
spreading 
the 

virus throughout the state. 
The University of Michigan’s 
plans 
for 
the 
fall 
term 

contradict 
the 
governor’s 

advice, as well as that of 
federal 
and 
state 
public 

health experts.

The University’s reopening 

plan 
is 
eerily 
similar 
to 

UNC’s plan — which has been 
referred to as a “clusterfuck” 
due 
to 
the 
explosion 
of 

positive 
COVID-19 
cases 

across the university. How 
much 
longer 
before 
the 

University, 
in 
particular 

President Schlissel, admits 
that we cannot safely house 
or 
teach 
in-person 
this 

semester? 
Will 
we 
have 

to 
wait 
for 
hundreds 
of 

positive 
COVID-19 
cases 

on campus within the first 
week 
of 
classes, 
as 
the 

UNC, Notre Dame, NC State 
and UA communities have 
experienced? Or will the plan 
be to push forward to “make it 
through the semester,” until 
someone in our community 
dies? And if that were to 
happen, where the loss of life 
acts as the tipping point for 
the University — is the price 
of an in-residence experience 
worth the lives of service and 
custodial workers and other 
campus staff?

F

or my family, United 
States road trips were 
always 
a 
summer 

staple. Each year brought new 
adventures and experiences 
as we traversed the country. 
We visited small towns and 
big cities. We drove through 
Trump 
country 
and 
saw 

places where Democratic lawn 
signs dot the landscape. From 
Alaska to Florida, Hawaii to 
Maine, I have visited all 50 
states and seen not only the 
differences in our nation but 
also the similarities, such as 
our use of the post office. 

Anywhere you go in this 

country, you will notice the 
post office. From the blue 
mailboxes 
along 
the 
road 

to the distinct white, cubed 
postal trucks to the hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
dedicated 

postal carriers working rain or 
shine to deliver for us, the post 
office is universal. 

Over the past few months, 

we have seen a coordinated 
attack on the post office by 
the 
Trump 
administration. 

The head of the post office, 
Postmaster 
General 
Louis 

DeJoy, who was appointed by 
President Donald Trump, has 
been trying to gut the post 
office. He has directed a major 
overhaul of the post office, 
including slashing overtime, 
reducing business hours at 
certain locations and removing 
mail sorting machines. 

These changes have resulted 

in a major slowdown in the 
delivery 
of 
mail, 
a 
major 

concern given that millions 
of voters are expected to 
vote by mail in the November 
election. This slowdown of 
the post office is part of a 

concerted effort by Trump 
to disenfranchise voters and 
prevent Democrats from voting. 
Democrats 
are 
statistically 

more likely to vote by mail, 
so it makes sense that Trump 
does not want these people 
to vote. Recently, the postal 
service confirmed these fears 
by informing 46 states that 
they won’t have the capacity to 
deliver ballots on time.

Since these letters were 

sent, there has been a major 
outcry about the impact that 
these changes will have on 
the election. Twenty-one state 
attorney generals, including 
the Michigan Attorney General 
Dana Nessel, threatened to 
sue over the changes. Due to 
this backlash, the postmaster 
general reversed the plan until 
after the election. 

While 
this 
is 
a 
great 

development, we cannot let 
it distract us from the overall 
attack on the post office by 
Republicans. 
For 
decades, 

Republicans have attempted 
to dismantle and privatize 
the post office — a downright 
terrible idea. The post office 
employs more than 600,000 
Americans 
who 
serve 
the 

entire 
country. 
For 
many 

rural 
communities, 
private 

companies 
such 
as 
FedEx 

and UPS do not serve them. 
The U.S. Postal Service is 
so important for delivering 
medication and keeping people 
connected, especially during 
the pandemic. 

There are many things we 

can do to help protect the post 
office. Buying stamps and 
other items from the post office 
can help to fund them. You can 
also call your legislators to ask 

them to support the post office 
and continue to properly fund 
this critical organization. 

There is also a lot that 

Michiganders can do to help 
guarantee that we can safely 
vote and ensure that our votes 
are counted. Michigan is one 
of the states that will likely see 
record-breaking numbers of 
voters casting absentee ballots. 
Since the passage of Proposal 
3 in 2018, any Michigan voters 
can vote absentee without an 

excuse. In the August primary 
this year, 1.6 million voters cast 
an absentee ballot — more than 
any other in Michigan history. 
The 2020 election is expected 
to far surpass this, leading 
to major concerns about the 
capacity of the post office. In 
the August primary, over 6,000 
ballots were rejected because 
they 
were 
received 
after 

Election Day. If you want to 
avoid any issues with the post 
office, there are a few options 

that you can take to ensure 
that your vote is counted if you 
want to vote absentee. 

You should request your 

absentee ballot sooner rather 
than later. Instead of mailing 
back your ballot, you can 
deliver directly to your clerk’s 
office or leave it in an absentee 
ballot dropbox. There is a 
plan to have a dropbox put on 
the University of Michigan’s 
Central and North Campuses, 
making it easier for students 

to 
deliver 
their 
absentee 

ballots. 

As we look to November 

and beyond, we must remain 
committed to protecting our 
postal service in order to 
protect not only our elections 
but one of the most important 
governmental organizations 
that always delivers for all 
of us.

Seven days without electricity 

last 
August 
delivered 
me 

shaking 
and 
stimulus-starved 

on the steps of Viet Thanh 
Nguyen’s 
“The 
Sympathizer.” 

Hurricane Isaias had taken out 
most of Connecticut’s electrical 
infrastructure, along with all 
contact with the outside world. 
Only when removed from 21st 
century comforts could I approach 
Nguyen’s award-encrusted novel.

Nguyen combines historical 

fiction 
with 
spy 
thriller, 

following a nameless man with 
divided 
allegiances. 
Initially, 

his dense pages repelled me. 
However, Nguyen’s cutting social 
commentary drew me deeper. 

After 
being 
educated 
in 

the United States, the book’s 
protagonist returns to Vietnam 
to fight in the Vietnam War. He 
works as a communist sleeper 
agent in the office of the American-
backed South Vietnamese. As 
his moniker suggests, the man’s 
identity and allegiances are not 
clear cut. He muddles through life 
and war, sympathetic to all sides 
yet indecisive when it counts. 
His uncertainty makes him a 

questioning yet pliant cog in a 
larger, destructive war machine. 
While 
traveling 
between 

California 
college 
campuses, 

warscapes and movie sets, the man 
makes cutting observations about 
war, military, America, academia 
and, perhaps most significantly, 
his own confused identity. The 
man is both Vietnamese and 
American. He is innocent yet a 
killer, unwilling yet complicit. He 
is born of a poor Asian mother 
and a proselytizing European 
father. He fights for the South and 
North simultaneously, for both 
Capitalism and Communism.

In 
many 
ways, 
his 

circumstances 
dramatize 
the 

hyphenated experiences of A/
PIA 
(Asian-Pacific 
Islander 

American) individuals. A/PIA 
individuals are routinely asked by 
society or conscience to assert an 
allegiance, to define themselves 
and their ethnic identity within 
pre-scripted denominations of 
social 
acceptability. 
However, 

as the protagonist finds, the 
narrow range of Asian-American 
expressions is stifling. In “The 
Sympathizer,” 
pre-scripted 

roles of spy, communist and 
killer hamstring the unnamed 
protagonist. His mind ultimately 
fractures under his two-minded 
multinational duality. 

Yet, what I gleaned from 

“The 
Sympathizer” 
is 
that 

self-destruction is not the only 
resolution to the hyphenated A/
PIA question.

Within the novel, another 

character faces the allegiance 
question. 
It 
is 
through 
the 

protagonist’s co-worker and brief 
lover, Ms. Sofia Mori, that we are 
pampered with a fully realized 
thesis of the Asian-American 
experience. Reclining at the bar, 
smoking a cig, Mori takes the 
position that A/PIA individuals

On my belated encounter 
with ‘Pride and Prejudice’

I’ve been having a hard 

time keeping track of time, but 
Goodreads indicates that it 
took me just under two weeks 
to read “Pride and Prejudice.” 
For some reason it feels like 
longer. Or maybe not? Time is 
passing in strange ways now. 
Maybe it’s that everything I do 
now has a greater tendency to 
completely fill my field of vision. 
When I decided to read Austen’s 
classic, it was all I really wanted 
to do. Her long, intricate 
sentences seemed to take 
up my entire brain. 

My housemate, who is 

the kind of person who 
read these novels in her 
adolescence, lent me her 
copy. It’s one of those 
ugly-but-useful 
Dover 

Critical Editions that has 
a bunch of essays and an 
eye-wateringly extensive 
bibliography in the back. 
She told me she’s read it 
six or seven times and you 
can tell. Her marginalia 
is that of someone with 
a real affinity for the 
material, 
as 
well 
as 

someone 
who 
knows 

what’s going to happen 
almost by heart. When 
Wickham tells Elizabeth 
his 
(misrepresented) 

life story, my housemate filled 
the margins with skepticism. 
“Consider how unusual at the 
time it would be to just say all 
of this directly to someone you 
just met,” she wrote. Elizabeth 
says something similar later 
on: 
“She 
was 
now 
struck 

with the impropriety of such 
communication to a stranger, 
and wondered it had escaped 
her before.” My housemate’s 
experience of this book reminds 
me of Zadie Smith’s analogy for 
rereading: like walking into a 
house whose rooms you know 
very well, and you can see clearly 
the placement of the objects and 
their relationships to each other. 

Elsewhere, my housemate’s 

annotations are enthusiastic. 
“OMG he is so bad at this,” she 
writes next to Darcy’s awkward 
attempts to converse with Lizzy 
Bennet. “Awful,” she writes 
next to one of Mr. Collins’s 
ponderously 
misogynistic 

speeches. Austen is a writer who 
inspires this kind of immediate 
affinity, fandom even, in a 
way that a lot of other literary 
writers don’t. I wanted to share 
this affinity, but I couldn’t. Even 
though I felt a sort of affinity 
for her style and methods, I 
never felt fully absorbed by it. 
This is, of course, my fault and 

I immediately felt bad about 
it. I don’t really care about the 
canon, not exactly, but it does 
bother me a little bit that when 
someone asks me what my 
favorite novel is, I will answer 
with something published in 
the last 5-10 years. Uh, “My 
Year of Rest and Relaxation”? 
Maybe 
“Conversations 
With 

Friends”? I could lie and say 
“The Last Samurai.” That’s a 
book that people who want to 
be writers are allowed to have 
as their favorite, I think. It’s 
not that these are not good 
books, but it’s that I feel a little 
bit of shame at their topicality. 
They feel like news items and 
therefore whatever the opposite 

of edifying is. Of course, it’s not 
that I haven’t read “Jane Eyre” 
or anything, it’s just that I am 
not the kind of person who loves 
that kind of thing. 

What is “that kind of thing,” 

anyway? Maybe it’s the ethos 
Austen depicts. Her characters—
mostly the lower end of the 
gentry who are, in their own 
way, 
precariously 
situated—

spend a lot of their time visiting 
each other. They are constantly 
coming in and out of each other’s 
houses, being entertained in 
rooms 
specifically 
designed 

for 
the 
purpose, 
having 

conversations 
and 

judging 
each 
other’s 

conversational abilities. 
Conversation is like a 
game for these people: 
they are always trying 
to impress other people 
and (sometimes) trying 
to be fair and judicious in 
their own assessments. 
Darcy, who pretty early 
on 
refuses 
to 
dance 

with anyone at a ball 
and barely speaks to 
anyone, 
is 
met 
with 

such universal disdain 
by 
the 
Hertfordshire 

set because he basically 
confronts the concerns 
that 
animate 
these 

people’s lives and says 
“no, thank you.” No one 
seemingly dislikes him 
more 
than 
Elizabeth 

Bennet, who, as we know, ends 
up with Darcy in the end. 

Elizabeth’s 
opinion 

changes over the course of 
an 
uncountable 
number 
of 

social gatherings and chance 
encounters. 
Elizabeth 
visits 

Netherfield to see her beloved 
sister, who has fallen ill, and in 
the process is in the same room 
as Darcy in the evening. Later, 
she visits her friend Charlotte 
Lucas and her husband and 
Darcy happens to be in their 
social circle. It proceeds like 
that — largely by accident, and 
modestly. Austen’s characters 
are constantly making guesses 
and suppositions about their 
friends and relations that have 

to be confirmed by another visit, 
another noticed gesture. Even 
after it’s clear that Darcy and 
Elizabeth finally have chemistry, 
there are an intervening three 
or four visits and encounters 
before he proposes. It’s civilized 
in the extreme.

Austen is not even-handed 

or particularly realistic in her 
depiction of human beings, and 
veers into caricature more often 
than I would like. Austen has 
a particular disdain, it seems, 
for people whose education 
in manners has resulted in 
incomplete, stunted or overly 
self-possessed personalities. Mr. 
Collins, the ridiculous parson 
who proposes to Elizabeth in 
the first section of the novel, 
is an example of the kind of 
character who receives the 
most 
scorn 
from 
Austen’s 

narrator. Ditto for Mary Bennet, 
Elizabeth’s younger sister, who, 
by virtue of being “the only 
plain one in the family” is the 
most “accomplished,” meaning 
that she spends all her time with 
books and pretends not to care 
about balls or social functions 
where she would have little 
success. Her manners are rigid 
and solemn, and she sometimes 
repeats the lazy, misogynistic 
moralisms 
that 
Mr. 
Collins 

spouts. These two characters 
lack the natural, unstudied 
grace of Elizabeth and Jane.

Maybe this is an ethos of sorts 

for the novel as a form — drawn, 
as it is, as much from life as it is 
from other books, all the while 

disguising its source material. 
Even so, I didn’t like that Austen 
needed a character like Mary 
to make this point. More than 
once, I wrote in the margins 
‘THIS IS A REALLY CYNICAL 
BOOK’ and meant it. Of course, 
a more fair assessment should 
take into account the very real 
social 
pressures 
placed 
on 

women in Austen’s world. She 
insists on women’s subjectivity 
in a world determined to deny it, 
and even if the result is a narrow, 
bourgeois kind of freedom, it’s 
something. Elizabeth Bennet is 
certainly an appealing character 
— judicious, kind, capable of 
changing her mind. Maybe my 
favorite part of this book is 
the close, intimate bond that 
Lizzy has with her sister Jane. 
The former almost seems to be 
capable of predicting the latter’s 
thoughts and has an intense 
feeling for her happiness and 
unhappiness. There’s a lot to 
admire here, even if parts of it I 
found off-putting. 

One would think that a lush 

Regency novel where the stakes 
are ultimately rather low seems 
like the perfect distraction right 
now, but it was like my eyes 
kept slipping past the text. As 
much as I want to just shut out 
everything 
that’s 
happening 

and become an art monster, I 
really can’t bring myself to. Like 
a lot of people with too much 
time on their hands, I’ve been 
checking Twitter and news sites 
compulsively. In the absence 
of other stimuli, my inner life 

starts to resemble a constantly 
refreshing 
timeline: 
jittery, 

fragmented, important-feeling, 
ambiguous in composite. I’m 
already pretty ADHD but this 
has been making it worse. 

To pull my brain back from 

that flickering state to Austen’s 
long, 
intricate 
sentences 

frequently didn’t work. I found 
myself rereading paragraphs 
and losing the thread in the 
process. She writes like the 
second movement of Bach’s 
Italian Concerto, just constantly 
unspooling dripping elegance 
that resides mostly in details. 
Austen is resolutely against the 
grand gesture. I’ve been feeling 
the need, maybe, for something 
dramatic now that there is very 
little opportunity to make a 
grand gesture without being 
grossly irresponsible. Still, it 
hurts a little bit that nothing in 
my life really gets to the pitch 
I want anymore. Maybe this 
book is trying to convince me 
to seek validation in repetition 
and confirmation rather than 
this persistent desire for drastic 
change. 

It’s not the fault of the work 

that I happened to run into it 
at a uniquely bad time. Like any 
great work of art, “Pride And 
Prejudice” makes the reader 
adapt to it, and it could be that 
I was just resisting what the 
work is asking of me as a reader. 
Ideally, you have to meet a work 
on its own terms and not be 
always imposing yourself on it, 
as difficult as it might be.

PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT, 

FROM JOHNSON TO TRUMP: 
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?

COURTESY OF ELIZABETH YOON

This novel attests to the 
hyphenated A/PIA life

do not need to defend themselves 
or hold their identity accountable 
to anyone but themselves. Her 
theory of A/PIA identity requires 
steadfast 
stubbornness 
and 

self-reliance, 
existing 
beyond 

governmental policy or national 
status. Despite others’ opinions, 
only oneself can arbitrate self-
worth and identity. As Mori’s 
American 
experience 
implies, 

neither state nor society can 
resolve the allegiance question.

Relatedly, Mori’s boss, the 

Department Chair of Oriental 
Studies, 
often 
laments 
her 

inability to speak Japanese. He 
wishes she would “honor her 
culture” 
and 
Mori 
responds 

by venting after work hours, 
questioning the double standard 
applied to non-white Americans. 
Why should Mori safeguard her 
Japanese-ness if President John 
F. Kennedy does not need to 
hone his Gaelic? While lacking 
the modern terminology, Mori 
is alluding to the Perpetual 
Foreigner stereotype. 

During 
World 
War 
II, 

Japanese-Americans were forced 
out of their homes and into 
temporary concentration camps. 
As a survivor of Executive Order 

9066, Mori is intimately familiar 
with the Perpetual Foreigner 
Stereotype. The U.S. 1942 policy 
was underpinned by the idea 
that Asian-American individuals 
are 
incapable 
of 
successful 

assimilation 
into 
mainstream 

American society; the styeroptye 
posits 
that 
regardless 
of 

circumstance, 
any 
non-white 

individual will be regarded as a 
dangerous, subversive “other.”

Some may take issue with 

Mori’s “disregard for heritage” 
in the novel, but her frustration 
with her homeland resonates. 
Despite America’s sins against 
her family, she cannot relinquish 
or erase her American birth 
and upbringing. She has known 
nothing other than her American 
culture. And five years after 
publication, the animosity and 
identity-policing Mori describes 
in “The Sympathizer” still rings 
true. In 2020, Mori’s identity war 
of attrition is still ongoing. 

More than anything, “The 

Sympathizer” provides a very 
smart, very human treatise on the 
Asian-American experience and 
the ramifications of America’s 
militarism. Chapter by chapter, 
Nguyen juxtaposes the horrors 

of war with American promises 
and homely realities. Privy to 
capitalist boons, propaganda and 
the American Industrial Complex, 
the characters make unrelenting, 
uncomfortable and contradictory 
social commentaries.

Through absurd circumstances 

and vivid supporting characters, 
Nguyen does the hard work of 
articulating the strangled song 
of 
displacement 
and 
Asian-

American 
identity, 
scattered 

in 
the 
meandering 
cavities 

interconnecting our brains, lungs 
and tongues. And somehow, even 
when the world feels careless and 
chaotic, Nguyen provides a timely 
insight into the American past 
and present.

***
A 
recommended 
dish 
to 

devour alongside Nguyen’s novel 
is a classic bowl of pho, tripe 
optional. 

And if you’re still hungering 

for more, you can also view

at U-M in 2018 and his 2018 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily’s Michigan in Color.

Animated classic ‘Mare’ 
now streaming in the U.S.

In 
a 
parallel 
world, 

moviegoers, 
blissfully 

unaware of the COVIDs and 
the Faucis and the curves — 
flattened or otherwise — are 
settling down in front of the 
silver screen at their favorite 
theater for a rare Hungarian 
treat.

Their throats and noses 

gloriously 
exposed, 
these 

parallel-people 
are 
being 

dazzled by a tale of mythic 
proportions: 
haloed 
heroes 

travel across realms to save 
fairy royalty from the clutches 
of dragons with a strange 

fixation on securing mates 
of a decidedly non-draconic 
nature (isn’t there any love 
amongst the dragons?). But 
these 
inter-species 
affairs 

shouldn’t come as a surprise 
— this is the 1981 animated 
odyssey “Son of the White 
Mare,” from the Hungarian 
filmmaker Marcell Jankovics 
(“Johnny Corncob”), and the 
title is not exactly figurative.

The rest of us have to settle 

for being dazzled on our 
laptops. 
“Mare” 
premiered 

almost 40 years ago, but 
August 
marked 
its 
first-

ever premiere in the United 
States. 
Originally 
intended 

for theaters, the switch was 
made to local theaters’ virtual 

platforms 
(hosted 
through 

Vimeo) once the pandemic 
hit. “Mare” is something of 
a classic among animation 
aficionados, the psychedelia 
it 
provides 
showcasing 

the 
unique 
and 
limitless 

possibilities of the animated 
medium. Its U.S. premiere, 
Vimeo or not, is long overdue.

Based on a 19th century 

Hungarian epic poem and the 
folktales of the nomadic Avar, 
Scythian and Hunnic peoples, 
“Mare” presents a simple story 
with simple fairy-tale logic. 
Once upon a time there was a

‘You’re basic!’ and its 
gendered implications

The viral ballet video 

we misunderstood

There are few eras more difficult 

in a woman’s life than adolescence. 
Within these years, every action 
she takes is analyzed and critiqued, 
not just by friends, parents and 
teachers, but by society as a whole. 
In the past few years, one common 
critique has been directed at 
young women: You’re basic. From 
Snapchat filters to song lyrics, 
“basic” has become a foundational 
slang term for young people of 
the 2010s. So what 
does 
the 
term 

mean? 
For 
many, 

calling 
someone 

basic 
recalls 
the 

Ugg boots-wearing, 
pumpkin 
spice 

latte-drinking 
girls 

of 2015. Over time, 
these “basic bitches” 
have evolved beyond 
their original form, 
becoming the image 
of anyone deemed a 
follower. Or, for the 
most part, any young 
woman that dares to 
have interests. 

I want to take a 

look back at history 
— the year 1964, 
to be exact. In the 
music 
industry, 

this year would be 
the catalyst to the 
British Invasion, as The Beatles 
performed on The Ed Sullivan 
Show and threw America into a 
frenzy. When you look at images 
from this iconic moment, they do 
not show the cliché Beatles fan 
we might picture today. There 
are no 54-year-old white men 
in faded ringer tees lamenting 
over the death of “real music.” 
In fact, it’s quite the opposite. 
“Beatlemania” was characterized 
by screaming, crying, obsessing 
teenage girls. Yet this did nothing 
to discredit the band, and they 
are still remembered today as 
one of the greatest groups of all 
time. Ironically, today a teen 
girl wearing a Beatles shirt is 
usually scoffed at by exactly 
that cliché fan. And if they can’t 
name the title of the first demo 
off of a scrapped album that John 
Lennon wrote in 1963 well, then, 
they can’t even call themself a 
fan.

This 
disdain 
for 
alleged 

imposters 
stretches 
beyond 

popular 
music. 
Teen 
girls 

listening to Led Zeppelin are try-
hards. Electronic fans are festival 
hoes. Rap fans are bandwagoners. 
Name any genre and it conjures 
the 
face 
of 
someone 
who 

represents 
something 
wrong 

with the fans of that style, and 
all too often, that face is young 
and feminine. And all too often, 
it is the men of a particular 
fanbase who scoff at their female 
counterparts as if they are of less 
worth and credibility than them.

You may be thinking, “Hey, 

it’s really not that deep.” And 
in some ways, you would be 
correct. Calling someone basic 
has become so common the word 
barely has meaning anymore, and 
there are much more harmful 
words and actions thrust at 
women — so many, that talking 
about them could become an 
entire anthology. But ridiculing 
any interests of a young growing 
girl can be impactful in ways 
beyond just forcing them to spend 
summers listening to sad indie 
white boys instead of Megan 
Thee Stallion. Everybody has an 
individuality complex: the desire 
to be special, to be one-of-a-kind. 
To be able to say “I liked that 
show years ago” or “I wore that 
shirt first” and somehow derive 
superiority 
from 
their taste. 

This superiority often manifests 
itself as internalized misogyny, 
actively rejecting femininity or 
what are traditionally considered 
feminine interests because they 

inherently see womanhood and 
everything associated with it as 
less than. 

At least in my life, dealing 

with internal misogyny can be 
an everyday battle, especially 
when many older generations 
of women base their worldview 
in it. I buried my nose in books 
and barely brushed my hair as a 
child because I thought caring 
about looks would mean I was 
superficial and stupid. And these 
mantras 
never 
end. 
Women 

should cover up to make a man’s 
life easier. Women shouldn’t have 

ambition 
because 

that 
hurts 
their 

family. Women need 
to wear dresses and 
makeup and keep 
their hair long to 
be pretty. Women 
are 
forced 
into 

little 
boxes 
that 

others 
construct 

for them in order to 
be accepted, and in 
order to preserve 
such a system, they 
must 
constantly 

have their worth 
attacked. 

I 
have 
a 

radical 
request: 

Just 
let 
women 

live. 
Someone’s 

intelligence 
and 

worth as a person 
is not determined 
by the culture they 

consume 
or 
produce. 
Being 

“basic” does not exist. Whether 
one views themself as alternative 
or mainstream or somewhere 
in between, there are a million 
other people in the same position 
as them. There are enough forces 
acting against the interests of 
women, we don’t need to drag 
each other down as well. Watch 
“Love Island” with your friend 
in the Slipknot shirt or throw 
on your Air Force 1’s to go see 
that new foreign film with the 
girl from class. Individuality is 
a waste of time when there is a 
world of interests to be tried out 
and different people with whom 
to engage. If all else fails, get a 
group together and stand in your 
local record store comparing 
One Direction to The Beatles; 
sometimes it’s nice to just have a 
laugh.

because they can shake trees, 
crumble stones and temper 
iron with their bare hands, 
et cetera, et cetera. At one 
point an adolescent 
Treeshaker says to 
his 
equine 
mom, 

“An old man told me 
to ask you to nurse 
me for seven more 
years and then I 
will be strong!” and 
she just goes with 
it. And in classic 
mythological 
fashion, 
every 

narrative 
obstacle 

occurs three times 
(the 
third 
time 

usually being the 
charm).

But 
these 

unsophisticated 
story beats are easy 
to forgive — myths 
are usually fluid, 
often 
simple 
and 

almost always silly 
at their core (even 
when 
plumbing 

grimdark 
depths). 

“Mare” is a story 
of 
mythic 
logic 

but 
psilocybin 

proportions. 
From 

beginning 
to 
end, 
color, 

sound and shape crash in 
a 
phantasmagoric 
display, 

sampling the very best of 
French 
classic 
“Fantastic 

Planet,” 
the 
Beatles-driven 

“Yellow 
Submarine” 
and 

that 
weird 
alcohol-induced 

trip in “Dumbo.” The art 
style 
is 
simple 
— 
largely 

solid colors and flat shapes 
— but in motion the setting 
and 
characters 
twist 
and 

shimmer and transmogrify. In 
one particularly remarkable 
segment, colors pulsate as a 
horse’s womb enlarges into 
a great cosmic tree only to 
morph back into that same 

horse’s vulva as a little baby 
boy pops out and shifts into 
a panorama of the night sky 
whose stars transform into 

the sweat and tears of the 
proud mare as she licks her 
newborn colt.

The miracle of childbirth!
Jankovics 
matches 
the 

psychedelic 
display 
with 

expert choices in art direction 
that marry myth to modernity 
— the sinister dragons that 
Treeshaker and his brothers 
must vanquish are not the 
scaly reptiles of yore but are 
fashioned 
after 
machines 

of war and cyclopean cities. 
These flourishes make the 
age-old 
story 
fresh 
and 

interesting, but unfortunately 
these modern touches don’t 
extend too deep, as “Mare” 

peddles 
in 
the 
geriatric 

gender politics required of 
almost any mythos story, with 
damsels simultaneously being 

in 
distress 
and 

screwing 
over 

the whole world 
in 
Eve-fashion. 

Treeshaker 
fashioning 
a 

sword 
from 

another 
man’s 

beard 
and 

swooshing 
it 

around 
between 

his legs isn’t too 
subtle 
either, 

but 
can 
one 

really 
expect 

an 
adaptation 

of myth to not 
feature 
heavy 

phallic imagery?

Animation 

is 
often 
at 
its 

best 
when 
it 

accomplishes 
something 
live 

action 
cannot. 

“Mare” is a firm 
example of such 
a film, a visual 
journey 
that 

should 
satisfy 

mythology 
nuts, 

cartoon geeks and anyone 
looking for a brief sojourn in a 
parallel world.

The rest of us have 
to settle for being 

dazzled on our 
laptops. “Mare” 
premiered almost 
40 years ago, but 
August marked its 
first-ever premiere 

in the United 

States.

The world first saw Anthony 

Mmesoma Madu dance back in 
June — his teacher and studio-
founder Daniel Owoseni Ajala 
posted a video of the 11-year-old 
student turning and leaping in 
the rainy outdoors of his native 
Nigeria. The boy’s bare feet 
propelled him off the muddy 
ground through an impressive 
combination of classical ballet, 
and the clip soon went viral. In 
the United States and Europe, 
professional dancers with large 
followings 
on 
social 
media 

reposted the video and offered 
words of admiration for Madu’s 
tenacity. New York City Ballet 
superstar Tiler Peck invited him 
to join her as a guest on her daily 
IGTV ballet classes. Viola Davis 
posted the video to her Instagram, 
and Nigerian journalist Fade 
Ogunuro announced over Twitter 
that she planned to pay for the 
rest of Madu’s academic expenses 
through the end of college. Earlier 
this month, the American Ballet 
Theatre 
Jacqueline 
Kennedy 

Onassis School offered him a 
full scholarship to their virtual 
summer 
program, 
including 

additional funding for his internet. 

The news coverage started 

quickly. BBC, NPR, Washington 
Post, Good Morning America, 
Reuters, People Magazine and 
TIME make up only a partial list 
of publications that covered the 
story. This attention makes sense; 
Madu’s is a tale of opportunity in 
a world currently stricken by loss. 
The dance industry in particular 
has 
already 
hemorrhaged 

millions, if not billions, of dollars 
in the wake of waves of COVID-
19 and there continues to be no 

clear date for the safe reopening of 
theaters and performance spaces. 

When the ABT JKO School’s 

director 
Cynthia 
Harvey 

announced Madu’s scholarship, 
she touched on this context. 

“Here, 
we’re 
complaining 

about not being able to open 
our buildings,” she told the The 
Cincinnati Enquirer. “But in that 
video, I saw a boy who was a 
perfect example of the tenacity 
someone can have when they 
have love and a dream. It was 
immediately obvious how much 
determination he had.” 

Madu’s work ethic can indeed 

feel humbling in an environment 
stricken 
with 
complaints 

surrounding 
the 
discomfort 

of dancing in one’s own air-
conditioned living room. The 
imagery of his dancing in the 
rain seems to have rekindled 
the 
dwindling 
motivation 

of 
many 
dancers 
currently 

training at home while living 
on tiny unemployment checks. 
Nevertheless, all of this attention 
feels narrow: If this student 
is truly the world’s paragon of 
tenacity, why did he have to 
become a viral sensation to even 
be noticed? 

Socioeconomic 
accessibility 

in ballet became a revitalized 
conversation topic this summer. 
In the wake of a global reckoning 
with systemic racism, activists 
continue 
to 
push 
ballet’s 

leadership to acknowledge and 
rectify the deep roots of elitism 
and white supremacy upon which 
this art form was built. Even 
today, FiveThirtyEight predicts 
that a ballerina in training may 
spend up to $100,000 before 
landing a professional contract 
(minus the female-only pointe 
shoe category, the number is 
still close to $70,000). As the 

pressure mounts for rich, white 
dance institutions to increase 
their support for communities 
cut off by such insurmountable 
price tags, Madu’s story offers 
a dangerously easy narrative of 
change — a young prodigy finally 
given the opportunity his talent 
deserves. But this narrative only 
includes the story of one student; 
the story would be exponentially 
more powerful if we sought to 
include the empowerment of 
Madu’s classmates as well as other 
underserved communities across 
the globe. 

Madu’s studio, the Leap of 

Dance Academy, is a prime 
example 
of 
organizations 

deserving 
of 
such 
financial 

support 
and 
community 

validation. The founder, Daniel 
Owoseni Ajala, is a self-taught 
dancer with a dream of expanding 
dance education for his own 
community. 
He 
teaches 
his 

students from his own apartment 
and doesn’t charge for lessons. 
In addition to dance, he provides 
academic tutoring and a weekly 
meal. As Madu’s video made the 
rounds on social media, Ajala 
received an influx of donations 
and an invitation to ABT’s two-
week teacher training program, 
but these parts of the story were 
left out of the vast majority of 
coverage. Instead, the articles and 
video featurettes focused solely on 
Madu’s talented turns and jumps 
— almost all of them mentioned 
the boy’s talent as a motivational 
symbol for a world crushed by an 
ongoing pandemic. Apparently, 
students and communities like 
Madu’s only become relevant 
with a global health crisis as the 
backdrop. 

I have a radical 
request: Just 
let women live. 

Someone’s 

intelligence and 

worth as a person is 
not determined by the 
culture they consume 

or produce.

GOOD MORNING AMERICA


O

n Tuesday of Wel-

come Week this 

year, I had dinner 

alone on my porch. The house I 

had moved into just a few days 

earlier was still uncomfortably 

hot, so I fled to the cool breeze 

and quiet murmur of the street. 

Settling into a chair, I watched 

the world go by in front of me 

as dusk faded into night.

Usually, when I sit still in 

such a bustling environment, 

I like to imagine where people 

are coming from, where they 

are going, who they are talk-

ing to on the phone and other 

mildly 
entertaining 
things. 

This time, though, I was fo-

cused on whether or not peo-

ple were wearing masks. 

Since Gov. Gretchen Whit-

mer signed Executive Order 

2020-153, Michiganders have 

been required to wear face cov-

erings in public spaces — both 

indoors and outdoors — to 

stop the spread of COVID-19. 

Adherence to these and other 

guidelines 
represents 
cru-

cial public health measures for the state of 

Michigan, which has suffered more than 

6,700 of the approximately 180,000 corona-

virus deaths in the United States thus far. By 

my count, it seemed that less than half of the 

people who walked past my house that eve-

ning were wearing masks.

In addition to inadequate mask compli-

ance, the return of students this fall has also 

increased the probability of super-spreader 

events. Large universities like ours, such as 

the University of North Carolina at Chapel 

Hill, Notre Dame University and the Uni-

versity of Alabama, have already succumbed 

to spikes in cases that have been traced back 

to bars and off-campus parties. With each 

new day, another university learns the same 

lesson about trusting its entire student body 

to restrain itself during one of the biggest 

party seasons of the year.

Over the course of the past week, I con-

ducted interviews collecting people’s per-

ceptions about our campus community’s 

response to the pandemic, as well as our 

chances of maintaining in-person instruc-

tion. How likely was it that our campus 

would experience similar outbreaks to those 

at other colleges? While there were differ-

ences in opinion on many issues, one par-

ticular prediction proved unanimous: the 

University of Michigan is next.

To me, this was cause for alarm. Practi-

cally everyone I asked predicted the Univer-

sity would be completely online within one 

or two weeks, and that the freshmen would 

likely be sent home before they even got a 

taste of the much-advertised “First Year Ex-

perience.” It was quite confusing to watch 

other people, especially my peers, go about 

their daily lives as if nothing especially odd 

was happening.

At the outset of my investigation, I want-

ed to explore the fatalism that had taken 

hold of our campus community. Operating 

under the assumption that a move to all-

online instruction was a litmus test for our 

ability to contain the virus, I struggled with 

the question: Is the closure of campus inevi-

table? Or, in metaphorical terms: Are we liv-

ing through the calm before the storm?
T

he belief in the likely failure of 

the University’s reopening plan 

was certainly widespread, but I 

still questioned the prevailing wisdom that 

there was nothing I could do to stop it. As 

a senior, the social connections and experi-

ences I have built here over the years give 

me a relatively small, but relevant sphere of 

influence. I could still choose not to attend 

social gatherings that might endanger my 

health or the health of others, and encour-

age my friends to do the same.

But what if I had just arrived on cam-

pus, desperate to make friends and wriggle 

my way into the fabric of college social life? 

This is the plight of the current freshmen, 

who since March have had major coming-

of-age events such as prom, graduation and 

now Welcome Week canceled or severely 

limited to virtual equivalents. I remember 

when I was a freshman; the first few weeks 

were a mad dash to attain the sense of feel-

ing established and comfortable in my own 

skin. 

My intuition is that most upperclassmen 

like me have probably not thought much 

about this year’s freshman class, let alone 

interacted with them in any meaningful 

way. To better understand their perspective, 

I talked with a few freshmen who decided to 

study on campus for the fall term this year.

The first freshman I spoke with was David 

Welch, a student in the School of Engineer-

ing and an Ann Arbor townie. In our phone 

conversation, I asked David why, even with 

the pandemic still raging, he would still opt 

for the perennial college experience of liv-

ing in the dorms rather than at home just a 

few miles away.

“What I want to do is meet new people,” 

Welch said. “I feel like that’s the most im-

portant thing that I could potentially miss 

out on if I didn’t, you know, live in a dorm.”

For the majority of undergraduates, re-

turning to campus offers the opportunity of 

connecting with their peers. There is noth-

ing wrong with that, though I did find it 

unfortunate that the parties thrown by the 

elder undergraduates would likely lead the 

first-year experience to be more of a first-

few-weeks experience.

Bea Brockey is another freshman who 

will be starting her first semester in the 

LSA Residential College, a living-learning 

program especially geared toward under-

classmen. RC students have the privilege of 

living and taking classes in East Quad Resi-

dence Hall for their first two years, though 

the uncertainty of the pandemic has made 

students like Bea wary of getting too com-

fortable.

“I really hope we get to stay as long as 

possible but I think we’re gonna get sent 

home in, like, two weeks or a month,” Bea 

said during our phone conversation. 

I then asked Bea whether she thought 

campus closure was inevitable. “College stu-

dents aren’t necessarily notorious for their 

ability to follow the rules, and I think people 

are going to party. They have been partying 

at other colleges that have reopened. And if 

they do that, I think it’s likely that we will be 

sent home.”

I felt empathy for the freshmen I inter-

viewed about the upcoming semester, if only 

in the sense that I also felt I had very little 

control over how things would play out. I 

wondered: Is there any evidence out there 

that Michigan will be able to stop the spread 

of the virus and deliver a quality in-person 

education at the same time?
T

he first data source I probed was 

my own lived experience. On two 

consecutive nights, I went out 

late in the evening to scope out the streets, 

and this time not just from my porch.

Donning a face mask, I set off on the first 

night for a walk around campus. I walked 

by a group of guys playing a game of beer 

die, blasting music and shouting as the dice 

plummeted toward a carefully painted ta-

ble. I passed by several restaurants where 

bare-faced diners were wolfing down their 

meals in the outside seating area. Wher-

ever I looked, it seemed like more people 

were wearing their masks around their neck 

than on their actual faces. I even had a few 

minutes completely to myself as I walked 

down an empty State Street, but the rela-

tive solitude was interrupted when a group 

of roughly twenty girls dressed up to go out 

ran past me on the sidewalk.

The next night, I interviewed some of 

the late-night revelers. The prevailing senti-

ment among the people I talked to was that 

they were just having a good time (all spoke 

on the condition of anonymity). They did 

not believe what they were doing was harm-

ful, and many said they felt poorly informed 

about the consequences of getting in trouble 

anyway.

This lack of awareness was not surpris-

ing. In fact, the University has largely avoid-

ed addressing disciplinary action in its COV-

ID-19 messaging but instead has appealed to 

students’ sense of responsibility. In an inter-

view with The Daily, University President 

Mark Schlissel complained that “I get a lit-

tle insulted when everybody says there’s no 

way that students are going to wear masks, 

and there’s no way that they’re not going to 

party in dangerous fashions, and there’s no 

way they’re mature enough to recognize the 

importance of the moment and behave like 

the adults that you all are.”

But students disagree, and for good rea-

son.

In an episode characteristic of mature 

adults, a Twitter user captured a photo of a 

social gathering that featured a banner with 

the words, “You can’t eat ASS with a mask 

on.” The photo also featured another banner 

that seemed to have “Rush Phi Psi” written 

across it in red letters, referring to the fra-

ternity Phi Kappa Psi.

The University’s public response was one 

of mild displeasure toward the students in 

the photo. In an email to The Daily, Univer-

sity spokeswoman Kim Broekhuizen wrote 

that even though the banner was “embar-

rassing,” it constituted protected speech 

under the first amendment. She also main-

tained that Phi Kappa Psi was not affiliated 

with the gathering and that the people in the 

photo were not breaking any public health 

guidelines. On the other hand, she wrote 

that she “thoroughly condemns” those who 

were harassing or threatening the residents 

on social media.

Jeff Lockhart, a sixth-year Ph.D. student 

in sociology and complex systems who is 

also involved in the Graduate 

Employees’ 
Organization’s 

COVID Caucus, pointed out 

the irony in Broekhuizen’s 

statement during our phone 

conversation.

“It seems to me like what 

the University is already do-

ing is letting people off the 

hook and assigning no sort of 

criticism at all for that kind of 

behavior, while actively criti-

cizing the people who call it a 

potential problem.”

When I asked Lockhart for 

his opinion on the Universi-

ty’s reopening plan more gen-

erally, his response caught 

my attention.

“We know that this Uni-

versity administration is liv-

ing in fantasy land, right?” 

He then referred to an argu-

ment Schlissel made during a 

“Virtual Faculty Town Hall” 

in mid-August about testing; 

namely, that students who 

tested negative for COVID-19 

would be emboldened to take 

greater risks, just as gay men 

supposedly did during the HIV/AIDs epi-

demic. As Greg Gonsalves wrote in his ar-

ticle for The Nation, Schlissel’s statement 

was “a fabricated tale, stigmatizing gay men 

all over again as vectors of disease and infec-

tion.”

Lockhart further criticized Schlissel’s 

statement as a justification for not carrying 

out regular asymptomatic testing on-cam-

pus: “Anyone who knows anything about 

HIV public health knows that regular as-

ymptomatic testing is crucial … so for him to 

say that HIV testing is an example of why we 

shouldn’t have asymptomatic widespread 

testing; it is the most backward, nonsensical 

thing.”

In fairness to Schlissel, he has since made 

several apologies for this statement in the 

wake of criticism from U-M’s Queer Advo-

cacy Coalition. Nevertheless, his slip of the 

tongue was not merely a mistake; it was a 

window, an invitation to discover a wealth 

of unsettling evidence regarding potential 

corruption in the University’s reopening 

scheme.

Lockhart shared with me two key docu-

ments that reveal a suspicious misalignment 

between expert knowledge and University 

policy: The Report of the Ethics and Privacy 

Committee that Schlissel himself charged 

with investigating the University’s options 

for reopening, and a more recent document 

titled “Update on the current situation and 

planning for the Fall Term” by the same com-

mittee. The Report assesses the ethical im-

plications of a return to in-person instruction 

“from a diverse array of standpoints,” taking 

into account the moral obligations the Uni-

versity has to its students, faculty, staff and 

surrounding communities. Its publication on 

June 8 preceded the announcement of the 

University’s Maize & Blueprint plan for what 

Schlissel called, “a public health-informed 

in-residence semester this fall.”

However, the Update memo, originally 

sent on July 31 according to the memo’s 

header, was not made public until Dr. Silke-

Maria Weineck — a professor at the Universi-

ty — shared it on her Twitter account on Aug. 

24. The main assertion of its authors is that 

we, as a University, would likely turn Ann Ar-

bor into a COVID-19 “hot spot” that placed 

members of the campus community as well 

as all members of adjacent communities in 

serious danger. 

The publication of the document was just 

one of a series of actions by University em-

ployees demanding greater accountability 

and transparency from the University. On the 

Friday before classes began, the Faculty Sen-

ate considered a vote of no confidence in the 

administration, one day after an anonymous 

staff member published a scathing Op-Ed in 

The Daily.

I

n November of 2009, a special elec-

tion in New York state meant that 

school was cancelled, so my mom 

decided to take my sister and I into New 

York City for a girl’s day. We planned to shop 

for hours at our favorite stores, stuff our-

selves with classic New York pizza for lunch 

and venture to Midtown Manhattan. Before 

we left for the city, my mom explained that 

I would need to give a urine sample to the 

doctor. Since I had never really had to go to 
the doctor for anything major, aside from 

the pneumonia I had gotten in August two 

months prior, I was skeptical, but I quickly 

forgot about it as we drove into the city.

Under any other circumstances, I would 

have been having a blast, but this girls day 

trip was different. I was too tired to walk 

around, too busy thinking about when I 

could get my next bottle of water and too 

focused on how badly I needed to use the 

bathroom to really enjoy myself. I tried to 

ignore how I was feeling and relish the day 

to the best of my ability, but I passed out 

from exhaustion the second we got into the 

car for the ride home. 

My first stop when I walked into the 

house was the bathroom, which had be-

come a part of my normal routine for the 

past three months, and then I asked my 

mom for ice cream as a snack. After get-

ting me ice cream, she checked the answer-

ing machine on the landline. She noticed 

she had nine missed calls from the doctor, 

so she called my doctor’s office back im-

mediately. The next thing I knew, my mom 

grabbed the ice cream out of my hands as 

she frantically called my dad, and we were 

getting back into the car. 

After driving for what felt like hours, we 

arrived at a hospital 30 minutes from my 

house, where the doctors were expecting 

me. Yet, unlike the doctors, I was not ex-

pecting anything that would happen that 

day. 

As I sat in the hospital bed, feeling con-

fused, hungry and scared, I was told to get 

comfortable. I was told I’d be there for a 

while, and I tried my best to tune out the 

grumbling inside my stomach as the doctors 

emphasized the importance of conducting 

tests on an empty stomach and pricked me 

with needles.

Words were thrown around the room. 

Words with meanings I didn’t know. Words 

that scared me: “Juvenile Diabetes,” “type 

1,” “manageable,” “treatable, not curable,” 
“injections” and “pancreas,” just to name a 

few.

The word pancreas was particularly new 

to me. I had never used, heard or seen this 

word before, but the doctors kept mention-

ing it to me and my parents. While my par-

ents tried to understand what the doctors 

were saying, their faces scrunched up with 

concern and focus, I sat in my hospital bed 

feeling like I was watching somebody else’s 

life, in disbelief that this was actually hap-

pening to me. It didn’t take long for the doc-

tors to realize how lost I was in this sea of 

new information. After a few minutes, the 

head doctor sat at the end of my hospital bed 

and asked me if I was familiar with the game 

Pac-Man.

Pac-Man is an arcade game in which the 

player navigates the Pac-Man icon through 

a maze containing various dots, known as 

Pac-Dots, and four multi-colored ghosts. The 

goal of the game is to accumulate points by 

eating all the Pac-Dots in the maze, complet-

ing each level of the game. My doctor told me 

to think of my pancreas as the Pac-Man icon 

and the process of how my body functions as 

a type 1 diabetic as the whole game. 

The function of the pancreas is defined 

as a gland that produces enzymes that are 

released into the small intestine to help 

with digestion. It also contains clusters of 

cells called islets. The cells in these islets 

produce hormones such as insulin and glu-

cagon, which help to control the level of 

glucose (a type of sugar) in the blood. Simi-

lar to Pac-Man eating the dots, my pancreas 

needs to eat the carbohydrates that enter my 

body. Without eating the carbohydrates, my 

body cannot function properly and move on 

normally, just like Pac-Man cannot move on 

to the next level of the game without eating 

all the dots. Ultimately, Pac-Man will reach 

game over if it fails to eat the dots, and my 

body will begin to crash if my pancreas does 

not fulfill its responsibility of producing 

enough insulin. 

Unfortunately, the doctor explained, my 

pancreas had already experienced a game 

over, which means the insulin hormone had 

stopped being produced and there was a 

build-up of dots in my body. This build-up 

was affecting my everyday life. I always felt 

weak, I could never quench my thirst, I was 

constantly urinating and headaches were 

too frequent to keep count. 

The doctor explained to me that I would 

have to manually give myself injections of 

insulin, which would act as the Pac-Man for 

my body. The doctor used this analogy to em-

phasize the importance of taking care of my-

self — if I wanted to stay in the game of Pac-

Man, I had to be constantly focused and win.

The days following my diagnosis, I en-

tered a new world and my life became a 

large scale Pac-Man game. Every nutrition 

label became the layout of the game screen. 

Every time I had food, it became a new level 

to conquer and overcome. Every time I was 

able to correctly follow my mom’s lead to fill 

a syringe — with enough insulin to capture 

the number of carbohydrates in the food 

while keeping my blood glucose intact — 

was a step in the right direction and allowed 

me to progress. 

My house became diabetic-proof. We 

designated cabinets for all my new medica-

tions, a shelf in the refrigerator for my in-

sulin and containers around the kitchen to 

put used syringes in. My mom hid the Hal-

loween candy I had eagerly collected only 

a few days before. She would have to come 

into school three times a day to give me in-

jections and pack me a different snack when 

people celebrated birthdays. 

The challenges didn’t end as I grew old-

er; rather, I learned how to respond to them 

positively and with perspective. When I 

was on a trip to Australia a few summers 

ago, I wasn’t able to go scuba diving with 

my friends because of my diabetes. Instead 

of harping on the fact that I had to sit on the 

boat and watch them swim below the sur-
face, I spent the day snorkeling and learning 

about the reef. 

You cannot technically beat Pac-Man, 

just like there is no cure for diabetes. But I 

have learned just how manageable this dis-

ease is and that it is possible to live a normal 

life. It has taught me to deal with adver-

sity the same way Pac-Man deals with the 

ghosts: finding new routes, taking it level by 

level, remaining focused and diligent. 

Almost 11 years after my diagnosis, I am, 

like the rest of the world, living during a 

pandemic. I find myself feeling the same 

way I felt in that hospital bed 11 years ago: 

confused, scared, overwhelmed, anxious 

and unprepared. The fear of having to ac-

cept, comprehend and adapt to a new di-

agnosis mirrors the way we all now have to 

navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and the 

start of the school year. 

This idea of being forced to adjust to a 

new normal forces us to question how we, 

as young people, should approach this new 

year and this virus in a way that is productive 

and smart. It is not easy trying to adjust to a 

new normal, especially when it is a new nor-

mal we did not choose. And while analogies 

like Pac-Man can help one comprehend and 

adjust to a situation, the work, much like my 

journey with diabetes, should not stop there. 

In the coming months, we cannot deny our 

diagnosis — we must stay focused on the re-

ality that we are still in the heart of a pan-

demic — because with that negligence comes 

the obvious truth: game over.

A new normal

W

aiting for a financial aid offer is a lot like 

waiting for a medical diagnosis. The un-

known creates a fear so piercing, so all-

consuming, that when the anticipated phone call or email 

finally comes through, holding your fate in a short string 

of sentences, your life halts for a second. And then, the 

shock: Maybe it’s a temporary loss of hearing. Maybe 

your heart begins to race so much you forget to breathe. 
Maybe you grow limp, wilting under the weight of life-

altering information. And you can’t quite decide what’s 

worse: The anticipatory dread that precedes the news or 

the physiological, traumatic reaction that the news elicits.

I’ve experienced this kind of reaction only a few times 

in my life before one night at the end of July, when a hand-

ful of large numbers on a financial aid document told me I 

might not be able to return to the University of Michigan 

in the fall. The earliest time I can remember was when I 

first got my period. I had just returned home from going 

sledding with a couple of friends, and I pulled down my 

snow pants to find my baby-blue underwear stained with 

a small streak of beet-red blood. I clumsily redressed my-

self and hysterically reported my cherry-colored discov-

ery to my mom. I remember feeling like I was speaking 

inside a fishbowl, the words muffled and distant. 

Then there was the time I came home from sixth grade 

to find my house had been robbed. Neither the driveway 

littered with my mom’s jewelry nor the front door that 

had been left swung open and battered on the perimeter 

registered in my brain as red flags. It was the gaping space 

left next to our fireplace, where a TV had been the day 

prior, that finally triggered my primal fight-or-flight re-

sponse. Panicked, I incorrectly dialed 911 a couple times 

before finally collecting myself and dialing the correct 

digits.

And then there was the night I got rejected from 

Northwestern University’s prestigious Medill School of 

Journalism. The purple text on my application portal 

seemed to distort in front of me until I finally found the 

words: “We regret to inform you ...” The place I had spent 

months researching and fantasizing about and pining for 

had closed its doors to me; I felt like I had lost a future I 

hadn’t been able to live yet. 

Shifting my sights from the fiercely capable version 

of myself I dreamed I would be at Northwestern to some 

other, unknown person that would excel at a different 

school felt impossible. This, compounded by a brutal 

flare-up of my generalized anxiety disorder, meant that I 

would need to navigate a life-changing college decision 

process inside the headspace of someone I didn’t recog-

nize. 

Like most of my peers, I was tackling countless ad-

missions essays and scholarship applications, but found 

myself trying to navigate anti-anxiety medications and 

intensive therapy, too. In a moment of panic, I told my 

mom I didn’t want to live like this anymore, constantly 

adjusting my dosages and undergoing therapy to counter-

act my worsened symptoms only to be back at the same 

place: Anxious and uncertain and unsure about where in 

the world I wanted to go to college. A couple weeks be-

fore college decisions were due, my mom sat me down on 

our brown leather couch and told me college might not be 

the right choice for me. Her eyes, big and blue and brim-

ming with tears, looked into mine with intense worry. She 

knew that the version of me sitting in front of her was not 

ready for any sort of undergraduate education come Au-

gust. 

Then I was accepted into the University of Michigan. A 

younger version of myself in a better frame of mind might 

have seen my acceptance letter that spring and cried with 

joy. She might have then seen my official financial aid of-

fer a few weeks later and be overcome with pride looking 

at the considerable amount of aid I had received in grants 

and awards. That single offer, that single document told 

me where I needed to be. But my anxiety told me other-

wise — that I was incapable, damaged, too mentally un-

stable to go to college. 

And when I was at my senior prom, dateless and se-

verely bummed out, I looked around at my classmates, all 

of whom I’d known since first grade, and knew in my gut 
that I owed it to myself to start over, outside of Indiana 

and at the University. 

So, after a few more months of therapy, leaning into 

friends and family and allowing myself to regain the kind 

of confidence I carried before my Northwestern rejec-

tion, I found myself in Ann Arbor in the fall of 2019. I was 

anxiety-free and confident in my ability to excel in my 

classes, constantly riding a high of meeting new people 

and going to new places. Even when I would experience 

a wave of anxiety, a quick trip to a buzzing and happening 

Shapiro Undergraduate Library would remind me that 

this place and all the people in it are so much bigger than 

my anxieties will ever be. 

Come Halloween, I found a group of people I loved 

to be around, I had two work-study jobs and I was writ-

ing for an online magazine. Even throughout quarantine 

and the transition to online classes, I was talking with my 

U-M friends every day, naively hopeful for a fall semester 

back in Ann Arbor, where I would be a sophomore once 

again living off of over-priced lattes and the thrill of short-

lived eye contact with a pretty stranger.

When the isolation grew to be disheartening, I would 

picture myself in the places I thought would be waiting 

for me in the fall: An East Quad Dining Hall bustling with 

professors and students speaking different languages; 

a crisp, leaf-covered lane leading me to Tappan Hall; a 

bright window seat in the Literati Coffee shop. One year 

as a Wolverine meant that I had this bountiful stash of 

memories and experiences to store away and return to, 

pockets of joy and contentment to relive when life grew 

dull.

This made it all the more devastating when my parents 

delivered the crushing diagnosis this past July, a month 

before my sophomore year was supposed to begin: You 

cannot afford the University this year. My heart sank in 

disbelief and that odd, fishbowl-type of sensation came 

over me as my parents’ voices warped into muffled noises.

After a few moments, the news found its place in the 

logical part of my brain and I started panicking. Was I 

supposed to bail on my roommate? What would happen 

to my credits? What would I tell my friends with whom I 

was supposed to live junior year? Where would I transfer? 

The morning after I received Michigan’s diagnosis, I 

sent in my transfer application to an in-state institution 

with tears streaming down my face. I was overcome with 

panic — how could one document usher so much change 

into my life? I couldn’t eat or sleep for two days. Every 

waking moment was spent attempting to grieve the loss 

of the life I created for myself at U-M, while frantically 

trying to secure admission and housing somewhere in In-

diana.

My family and I called the financial aid office to in-

quire about the reasoning behind the significant reduc-

tion in my aid package. The officers spoke of formulas 

and the FAFSA, essentially attributing the entire reduc-

tion in my aid to a shift in our household as shown on the 

FAFSA. “Michigan” or “no Michigan” was determined by 

one highly-intricate financial aid formula calculated in 

just the right way. During this award cycle, the office ex-

plained, a faulty number was plugged into my application. 

So, it seemed, the answer was “no Michigan.”

But nevertheless, I am here, writing this article as a 

U-M student, as a sophomore gearing up for the begin-

ning of a year marked by social distance guidelines and 

other COVID-19 precautions. While my original diagno-

sis seemed to be completely inalterable, extensive com-

munication with the financial aid office helped me undo 

the faulty digit that led me to the blunt, cold end of a “no 

Michigan” equation. 

And so, I along with all of my peers are met with the 

sour taste of a different diagnosis: One that marks this en-

tire academic year with “cautious optimism” toward de-

livering a “health-informed semester.” One that involves 

a Michigan Union meticulously reconfigured so students 

study from a safe social distance, dining hall lines stretch-

ing for blocks and a campus-wide animosity that allows 

us to berate freshmen for partying. And we’re paying full, 

even increased, tuition for all of this.

Campus does not look like the University I remem-

bered while straining for first-year memories during an 

isolating quarantine or sitting across from my parents, 

crying at the thought of not being able to afford returning 

this fall. We’re struggling, endlessly irritated with our ad-

ministration and with each other as we clumsily navigate 
a “culture of care.” Nevertheless, all we can do with the re-

ality of this school year is conduct ourselves in a way that 

ensures no one else has to grapple with a similar fate. The 

diagnosis is seemingly crushing, but we’ve got to make do 

with it somehow.

A faulty diagnosis 
and a dream deferred

Matthew Beniers adds more elite 

playmaking ability

An old school center, Hunter Dickinson 

built for Big Ten competition

Here’s 
the 
thing 
— 
the 

Michigan hockey team didn’t 
need another forward in its 
incoming 
recruiting 
class. 

It already had two commits 
likely to go top 10 in the 2021 
NHL Draft, and another two 
borderline first-rounders eligible 
for the 2020 Draft. 

Without Matthew Beniers, the 

Wolverines would have an elite 
class of scorers and playmakers 
coming in this season. 

With 
him 
it’s 
downright 

ludicrous. 

Beniers also projects as a top-

10 pick in 2021, and it’s easy to 
see why. His quick feet and puck 
skills helped him notch a team-
leading 18 goals in 44 games for 
the U.S. National Under-18 Team 
last season, but he’s more than 
just a pure goal scorer. 

“His competitiveness on the 

puck, his willingness to win 
puck battles, to block shots, to 
do the dirty things that help 
you win hockey games really is 
what makes him special,” Seth 
Appert, a former U.S. National 
Team 
Development 
Program 

coach, said. “And then his talent 
combined with that makes him 
very unique.”

Beniers’ quick hands give 

him an inherent advantage in 
one-on-one situations, and his 

positioning at the turnover was 
enough to create that scenario. 
But 
what 
makes 
this 
play 

impressive is that he wasn’t even 
the first to the puck — the replay 
clearly shows that the defender 
hacked at it first. 

From there, Beniers manages 

to collect the bouncing puck, 
push it through the defender’s 
legs and still control it enough 
to deliver a perfect pass to his 
teammate. In a span of seconds, 
he showcases impressive speed, 
puck control, vision and balance. 
It would have been the assist 
of the tournament if not for a 
ridiculous save from Sweden’s 
goalie. 

This is an example of two 

teammates perfectly in sync. 
From the moment he picks up 
the loose puck in front of his 
own goal, Beniers knows where 
he’s going with it. He waits just 
long enough for his teammate to 
get past the defense while still 
avoiding an offside, and then 
delivers a perfect puck for a 
golden scoring opportunity. 

The ability to see the play 

developing, identify a passing 
lane and send a flawless pass 
that quickly is invaluable at 
the collegiate level. That level 
of instinct and understanding 
can create odd-man rushes and, 
ultimately, goals. 

“(At the NTDP, we) try to 

get our players to play this 
aggressive, attacking, instinctual 

game,” Appert said. “He has a lot 
of those things innately as well, 
and I think those things were 
just enhanced here.”

Again, Beniers knows exactly 

where he’s going with that puck, 
but this time, he’s deceptive 
about it. He uses his eyes to draw 
the defender toward teammate 
Dylan Peterson — No. 25 in the 
video — opening up space to 
hit fellow Michigan commit 
Thomas Bordeleau just outside 
the slot. Bordeleau casually 
undresses the defender, and the 
rest is history. 

When 
the 
season 
starts, 

college hockey will likely be an 
adjustment for Beniers. He’ll be 
playing against opponents that 
are older and more experienced, 
and he could be in for a rude 
awakening.

But 
he’s 
been 
through 

that before. In 2019, at just 17 
years-old, he was called up for 
the Under-18 World Juniors 
Championship, where he played 
alongside a certain Jack Hughes. 

“The beauty of him getting 

called up that first year is that 
he can slide in any role,” Appert 
said. “He’s skilled enough to play 
with Jack Hughes if there’s a 
spot on Jack’s line, but he’s also 
gritty enough to fulfill roles that 
the bottom six forwards have to 
fill.” 

Hunter 
Dickinson 
is 

comfortable in his own skin — all 
7-foot-1, 255 pounds of him. 

In an era of basketball where 

the traditional post-up center 
is 
an 
endangered 
species, 

Dickinson’s bruising style of 
play makes for a refreshing 
throwback. 

“Hunter, 
he 
understands 

he’s a post player,” Mike Jones, 
Dickinson’s high school coach at 
DeMatha Catholic in Hyattsville, 
Md., said. “He’s unique. He can 
shoot threes and pass the ball 
as well as anybody, but he also 
knows he can be extremely 
effective on the block close to the 
basket. A lot of bigs don’t want to 
do that. He’s very good at it.”

The 
Wolverines 
need 

Dickinson, a four-star center and 
the 42nd-ranked recruit in the 
247Sports composite rankings, 
to contribute right away. Two-
year starter Jon Teske graduated 
in the spring, leaving Dickinson 
and fifth-year senior Austin 
Davis — who has yet to start in 

his collegiate career — as the only 
centers on the roster. 

To contend in the Big Ten, 

having a viable center is essential. 
The conference ran through the 
position a year ago, and figures 
to do the same in the upcoming 
season.

No Power Five conference 

features a more potent collection 
of big men than the Big Ten. It’s 
a group headlined by first-team 
All-American 
and 
Naismith 

Award finalist Luka Garza, who 
comes back to anchor Iowa in his 
senior season. 

Kofi 
Cockburn, 
a 
7-foot-

1, 290 pound wall of muscle, 
turned down the NBA to return 
to Illinois for his sophomore 
campaign. Micah Potter and 
Nate 
Reuvers 
make 
for 
a 

dynamic duo of stretch-fives at 
Wisconsin. 
Purdue’s 
Trevion 

Williams torched Michigan for 
36 points and 20 rebounds last 
season. Trayce Jackson-Davis is 
a budding star for Indiana. 

The list goes on. 
It’s no easy task for an 

experienced center to tackle, 
let alone a freshman embarking 
on his first foray into college 

basketball. But if anyone is up for 
the challenge, Jones is confident 
that it’s Dickinson. 

“He’s 
always 
performed 

well against guys his size, guys 
with reputations,” Jones said. 
“When the bright lights come on, 
Hunter’s there. He’s a big-game 
player. He’s used to playing in 
big games with the spotlight on 
him, getting a ton of attention. 
I think he really thrives in that 
environment.”

Playing 
at 
a 
perennial 

basketball 
powerhouse 
in 

DeMatha afforded Dickinson 
multiple 
rendezvous 
with 

premiere talent. In January, the 
Stags squared off against Rancho 
Cristian in a nationally-televised 
showdown on ESPN. 

The meeting pitted Dickinson 

against 
Evan 
Mobley, 
the 

nation’s third-ranked recruit and 
consensus No. 1 center. While 
Mobley poured in 22 points and 
11 rebounds, it was Dickinson 
who stole the show, anchoring 
DeMatha with 28 points and 
three blocks in a 69-61 victory.

Freshman center Hunter Dickinson will bring post presence to Michigan, according to his high school head coach.

Three positives for Akienreh 

Johnson’s fifth-year

Meet Howard’s Herd: How eight 
guys made Section 130 fun again

In a moment of pressure, 

Akienreh Johnson knows how to 
deliver.

Johnson receives a pass out 

of the paint from Amy Dilk. She 
fires it around the three-point 
line to Haily Brown. Brown sinks 
the three.

It’s the biggest assist of senior 

guard Akienreh Johnson’s career. 
With under 20 seconds left in the 
fourth quarter of the semifinals 
of the 2020 Big Ten Tournament 
against Northwestern, Michigan 
has just secured the win. 

Johnson 
delivered, 
and 

Michigan will need her to 
continue to deliver this season as 
a fifth-year senior.

Johnson was granted a fifth-

year by the NCAA in early April. 
She suffered from a season-
ending ACL injury during her 
freshman year and petitioned 
the NCAA shortly for a fifth-
year after last year’s season was 
canceled due to COVID-19. 

Last 
season, 
the 
guard 

dominated the floor, securing her 
spot as a starter for Michigan. As 
one of two seniors last year, the 
Wolverines counted on her to 
lead the team both on and off the 
court as the captain.

This year, the Wolverines will 

continue to rely on Johnson’s 
leadership and versatility on 

the court. To better understand 
Johnson’s best assets, The Daily 
breaks down some film:

Post-entry passes
This clip, from Michigan’s Big 

Ten Tournament semifinal game 
against Northwestern, highlights 
Johnson’s 
crucial 
post-entry 

passes. She assesses her options, 
pivoting multiple times before 
committing to the pass in the 
paint. She finds then-freshman 
forward Naz Hillmon under the 
basket for an easy layup. 

Hillmon and Johnson have 

proven to be a formidable duo 
on the court. Their ability to 
read each other leads to multiple 
assists and points.

Most of the time, Johnson’s 

post-entry passes lead to buckets. 
But it’s not just the passes that 
make Johnson useful in the 
frontcourt. Equally important 
is Johnson’s willingness to be 
selfless. Later in this game, she 
dribbles around the arc waiting 
for the opportunity to give it 
to Hillmon. She understands 
her role on the team, and had 
the third-highest assists last 
year with 76 — only one behind 
Hillmon.

3-point shooting
Even with her high assist stats 

last season, Johnson dominated 
the three-point line all season. 
Here, she looks calm under 
pressure, with a Rutgers defender 
flying in her face. 

Last season she made 22 

threes, with a .364 shooting 
percentage, the second-most on 
the team.

Johnson’s ability to shoot 

makes 
her 
an 
even 
bigger 

threat offensively. It makes her 
challenging to guard. With her 
snappy post-entry passes as 
well as her impressive shooting, 
defenders have a hard time 
covering both aspects of her 
game on the offensive end.

Height
Johnson is tall for a guard, 

standing 
6-foot. 
In 
NCAA 

Division 1, the average height of 
a women’s basketball player is 
5-foot-6. 

Here, 
she 
bodies 
one 
of 

Rutgers’ guards, forcing her to 
make a bad pass. Johnson easily 
blocks the pass and takes the 
ball down the floor for an assist 
to then-sophomore guard Amy 
Dilk.

Her height also factors into her 

high rebounding and steals stats. 
Last season, Johnson averaged 
6.5 rebounds per game, with 208 
on the season. In steals, she led 
the team with 49.

Overall, 
it’s 
Johnson’s 

variability 
that 
makes 
her 

irreplaceable in the Wolverines’ 
lineup. Her shooting and passing 
ability, coupled with her height, 
make her virtually unstoppable 
on the court.

Whether you’ve been to a 

Michigan 
men’s 
basketball 

game in person or watched one 
on TV, you’ve seen them.

Perched in Section 130, eight 

individuals decked out in cow 
costumes jump up and down 
over the course of two hours, 
pumping up the Wolverine 
faithful and jeering opposing 
players. 
These 
costumed 

students, known as Howard’s 
Herd and previously known 
as the Bee-Line, have become 
one of the most visible and 
recognizable parts of attending 
or watching a Michigan game.

Three years ago, Section 

130 
was 
a 
more 
relaxed 

alternative 
to 
the 
student 

section. Featuring cushioned 
seats instead of benches found 
in Section 129, where the Maize 
Rage student section resides, 
most fans seated in Section 130 
spent much of their time sitting 
down and casually watching 
the game.

But in 2017, the Maize Rage 

decided it was time to change 
the culture of Section 130. 
One meeting, the Maize Rage 
announced they were looking 
for eight members to attend 
every game in Section 130 to 
try and increase its spirit and 
engagement. For senior Drew 
Hirselj, the decision was a 
no-brainer.

“I mean, getting free food 

vouchers 
and 
guaranteed 

seating?” Hirselj said, “It was 
one of the biggest no brainers of 
all time for me. I was sold right 
away.”

Then 
freshmen, 
Hirselj 

and seven friends attended 
Michigan’s first game of the 
season against North Florida, 
where they led Section 130 in 
chants, distracted opponents 
taking free throws and wrote 
quips on a whiteboard to poke 
fun at Osprey players. The group 
had succeeded in energizing 
the section, but they still felt 
like they needed an identity to 
separate themselves from other 
Maize Rage members.

“We were actually called 

the 130 Boys for those first few 
games,” senior Josh Goldstein 

said. “Then someone had the 
idea to have us dress up in 
bumblebee costumes to honor 
John Beilein and things really 
took off from there.”

As Big Ten-play kicked off 

in 2018, so did the “Bee-Line.” 
Decked in bee onesies, the 
eight freshmen presided in the 
front row of Section 130 and 
served as one of the most visible 
figures of the Crisler Center 
crowd that saw Michigan start 
15-1 at home.

“In the first half, we’re 

doing what we can to help on 
offense,” Goldstein said. “In the 
second half we’re helping out 
on defense.”

When the season came to 

a close, Beilein took the time 
to meet the group that paid 
homage to him at each game, 
giving them fist bumps and 
handshakes before posing for 
a photo. The moment served 
as validation for the Bee-Line, 
who were starstruck by their 
namesake’s support.

Michigan athlete creates group to 

battle racism

Last week, NBA players 

boycotted games after police 
shot Jacob Blake seven times 
in the back in Kenosha, Wis. 
This summer, the Big Ten 
created a coalition against 
hate and racism with members 
from every school in response 
to the police killing of George 
Floyd. 

But this June, amid the 

Black Lives Matter protests, 
Briana Nelson felt she needed 
to do more than protest.

The senior track athlete 

created Wolverines Against 
Racism (WAR), a student-
led group within Michigan 
athletics focused on student-
athletes coming together to 
use their unique platforms 
to help fight against social 
injustice.

“My ultimate goal would 

be for members of WAR to 
essentially go out and be the 
change,” Nelson said. “There’s 
a great variety of people we 
have. We have coaches, we 
have 
student-athletes, 
we 

have support staff members 
and there’s a lot of different 
members and each person 
has a unique opportunity to 
use their platform because 
everybody 
has 
different 

followers.”

As a track and field athlete at 

Michigan, Nelson recognized 
she has a platform that most 
don’t — and she planned on 
using it to make lasting change 

at the University.

After a conversation with 

a couple members of the 
administration 
she, 
along 

with fellow track athletes 
Jeryne 
Fish 
and 
Roland 

Amarteifio, hosted a “unity 
call” over Zoom with other 
Wolverines. Coaches, student-
athletes and support staff 
listened and shared their own 
experiences as Black student-
athletes expressed the many 
emotions they were feeling at 
the time. From there, the idea 
in Nelson’s head grew into a 
full-on plan.

“After that I felt really good 

about the community that 
we had and that space that 
we had created,” Nelson told 
The Daily in early August. 
“I felt that it should be an 
ongoing effort — not only 
just have a space to talk, but 
also a space to act, a space to 
create movement amongst my 
peers and staff that want to 
be involved and just create a 
continuous ongoing act that I 
felt was long overdue.”

On 
Juneteenth, 
Nelson 

hosted a second unity call, 
this time to help educate those 
on the call who might not 
know about the holiday and to 
discuss further ideas for what 
WAR could be. The positive 
responses and dialogue that 
came from that call affirmed 
both Nelson’s desire to start 
the 
organization 
and 
the 

importance 
of 
opening 
a 

communication among those 
interested in the cause.

“I think that we’re a lot 

stronger when we’re united,” 
Nelson said. “Everyone who’s 
interested has great ideas and 
wants to see change and that’s 
why they’re a part of it, but as 
we come together the effort 
will be a lot stronger.”

Nearly every varsity sport 

at Michigan had an athlete 
attend one of the unity calls, 
from water polo to women’s 
basketball. 
Going 
forward, 

that breadth of involvement 
will be important for WAR 
to both continue and have 
its biggest impact. Because 
those 
athletes 
will 
have 

conversations 
with 
their 

teammates, 
their 
families, 

their coaches. 

And 
right 
now, 
most 

Michigan athletes are white. 
A lot grew up in communities 
lacking in diversity. Many 
play in sports with very little 
diversity at the college level. 

So, as the country begins to 

reckon with racial injustice, 
white Wolverines will, too. 
WAR helps bring the issue 
to a level relatable for those 
student-athletes by sharing 
the 
experiences 
of 
Black 

people in a way they didn’t get 
growing up. 

“Seeing 
that 
there’s 

representatives 
and 
there’s 

people interested from all 
these 
different 
teams,” 

Nelson said, “and knowing 
they’re going to go back and 
be a leader on their team and 
then educate and lead their 
teammates and then their 
teammates are going to go out 
— it’s a domino effect.”

Briana Nelson felt inspired by the Black Lives Movement and began her own group at Michigan to fight racism.

Jacob Blake shooting spurs ‘M’ and 

EMU student athletes to protest

As droves of spirit wear-

clad Michigan and Eastern 
Michigan 
student-athletes 

marched through downtown 
Ann Arbor, senior defensive 
back Hunter Reynolds and 
Eastern 
Michigan 
junior 

linebacker 
Tariq 
Speights 

belted 
“Say 
His 
Name” 

through their megaphones. 

A second passed, and then 

the names George Floyd and 
Jacob Blake rose from the 
crowd with equal emotion 
and equal volume.

Until 
Aug. 
23, 
when 

Blake was shot by police in 
Kenosha, Wis., the response 
to Reynold’s and Speight’s 
call 
would 
have 
been 
a 

resounding “George Floyd.” 
Instead, there was confusion 
over which name to chant. 

There have been so many 

names. 
That’s 
emblematic 

of why Speights organized 
Sunday’s protest.

“Just seeing all the stuff on 

social media, it’s to the point 
where I’m past being tired 
of seeing the videos, seeing 
the hate that’s in our country 
against people of my skin 
color,” Speights said.

Speights 
organized 
the 

protest, and though he had 
attended numerous protests 
near his home in California, 
the 
Jacob 
Blake 
shooting 

galvanized him into leading 
one of his own. He knows he 
has a powerful voice, and he 

felt that the time had come to 
use it to a fuller extent.

“Everyone can use their 

platform 
today,” 
Speights 

said. “There’s a lot of student-
athletes in the crowd right 
now, and we have the unique 
ability 
to 
reach 
people 

because of what we do. In this 
age of social media, we have 
thousands of people, as soon 
as we post something, eyes on 
that post.”

Athletes, like many of those 

who marched Sunday, have 
thousands of eyes on what 
they do and what they post. 
Speights wants to make sure 
they use their voices for good.

“Organizing 
it 
took 

a 
conversation 
with 

(Reynolds),” Speights said. 
“We 
just 
put 
together 

something, put it on social 
media, and reached out to our 
teams.”

Nearing 
the 
end 
of 
a 

summer 
that 
saw 
almost 

constant 
protests 
across 

the country, Reynolds and 
Speights were delighted to see 
how ready their teammates 
and fellow student-athletes 
were to join the cause.

Each 
athlete 
has 
their 

individual following — up to 
thousands on social media — 
but those are amplified when 
combined with the followings 
of other athletes, especially 
as many as marched on Aug. 
30. 

The 
number 
of 
people 

currently protesting social 
issues 
could 
be 
mind-

numbing, 
but 
Sunday’s 

protest is better thought of 
as an extension of Speights’s 
philosophy for using his own 
voice.

“If you’re able to influence 

one person, that one person 
could go influence someone 
else,” Speights said. “So you 
can really end up influencing 
a lot of people for change just 
by influencing one person.”

Almost 
anyone 
with 

social media accounts has 
seen the hashtags promoted 
by 
those 
whom 
Speights 

echoes. They’ve seen other 
names, 
names 
he 
doesn’t 

want to get lost. They’ve 
seen 
#AhmaudArbery, 

#BreonnaTaylor 
and 

#ElijahMcClain. 
They’ve 

seen 
#GeorgeFloyd, 
and, 

most recently, they’ve seen 
#JacobBlake.

The promulgators of those 

hashtags have been affecting 
change for months now with 
the goal of dismantling all 
forms of systemic oppression, 
and the change Speights is 
trying to inspire resembles 
that which people have heard 
about on repeat since George 
Floyd’s death in May. 

Speights’ 
various 

motivations for organizing 
Sunday’s 
protest 
— 

increasing voter turnout and 
education, 
ending 
housing 

segregation 
and 
police 

brutality, promoting equality 
in education — may seem 
separate, but the purpose 
boils down to the words of 
another chant he led:

“No more hashtags.”

JACOB COHEN
Daily Sports Writer

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily

Eastern Michigan linebacker Tariq Speights helped organize a Black Lives Matter protest in Ann Arbor Sunday.

T 

ariq Speights has 
been a Black man 
in America for 20 
years. That’s 20 

years of living the pain inflicted by 
prejudice — the pain of living in a 
country where 
he never feels 
fully welcome, 
where he’s 
constantly 
judged by the 
color of his 
skin.

The pain, he 

says, has been 
a constant in 
his life. But on 
Sunday after-
noon in Ann Arbor, Speights did 
something he never thought he’d 
have the chance to do.

He stood in the shadow of the 

Hatcher Graduate Library with a 
white megaphone in his left hand 
and began speaking.

“It doesn’t matter what we look 

like, what we do, where we come 
from,” Speights said. “Everyone 
can use their platform today.”

It’s a message aimed at everyone 

who, someday, may be in his shoes. 
On Sunday, hundreds gathered 
in the Diag in solidarity, hoisting 
signs and donning t-shirts with 
messages of support. Speights had 
been in groups like that before, 
protesting in his hometown of 
Santa Clarita, Calif. But he’d never 
been the one to take the mega-
phone and demand change.

Now, Speights, a linebacker at 

Eastern Michigan, sees his role 
changing in real time. And he sees 
that change because he’s a college 
athlete in a time when college ath-
letes have an unprecedented voice, 
whether that’s fighting racial 
inequality or fighting for their 

rights as athletes.

“Any protest, any people stand-

ing up and speaking on what they 
care about is important, but for 
me, it hit a little different, it being 
student-athlete led and I’m a 
student-athlete,” Speights said of 
Sunday’s protest. “So yeah, that 
was huge and to see how many of 
my teammates, how many Michi-
gan student-athletes came out, 
it’s big. Us student-athletes have a 
unique ability to be able to touch 
people. So being able to get people 
to come out for who we are and not 
as much of what we do is big.” 

Over the summer, college ath-

letes’ voices dominated the land-
scape of American social media 
in a way they never had been 
before. When George Floyd was 
murdered by a Minneapolis police 

officer, college athletes spoke out, 
demanding change. When the Big 
Ten canceled fall sports, college 
athletes spoke out, demanding 
transparency from the conference. 
When other conferences threat-
ened to follow suit, college athletes 
spoke out, demanding comprehen-
sive safety protocol.

Six miles away from Speights’s 

Eastern Michigan, Hunter Reyn-
olds was one of those athletes dis-
covering his voice.

Reynolds, a senior cornerback at 

Michigan, understands the voice 
playing for the Wolverines gives 
him. Even as someone with lim-
ited playing time in his three years 
in Ann Arbor, he has the ingrained 
influence that comes with wearing 
the winged helmet.

“Due to social media, you’re 

just seeing it more because there’s 
been numerous incidents over 
the course of the summer where 
something’s happened and a 
player’s just tweeted something 
out and the tweet ends up with 
50,000 likes and 10,000 retweets,” 
Reynolds told The Daily on Sat-
urday night. “In 2005, if a college 
athlete spoke about something, 
they were really just limited to the 
local press.”

For Reynolds, that’s meant 

sharing the struggles he faces as 
a Black man in America in a way 
he never has before. This sum-
mer, he founded College Athlete 
Unity, a group of Michigan play-
ers demanding an end to racial 
injustice.

So when Speights reached out 

to him earlier this month with the 

idea of an athlete-led protest fol-
lowing the police shooting of Jacob 
Blake, an unarmed Black man in 
Kenosha, Wis., Reynolds knew 
there was a unique opportunity at 
hand.

“(Speights) felt it was important 

to host something where we keep 
the conversation going and let peo-
ple know that Black men and Black 
women being killed by police isn’t 
normal,” Reynolds said. “Things 
shouldn’t just go on as normal. And 
he reached out to me and once he 
described what he wanted to do, I 
was all in for it.”

For other student-athletes at 

both Michigan and Eastern Michi-
gan, the message resonated. Alexis 
Alston, a freshman on the Eagles’ 
soccer team, was one of them.

All summer, she had protested 

in her hometown of Amherst, 
Ohio. But as soon as she heard 
rumblings of Sunday’s protest, 
she knew it had the potential to be 
special.

“A lot of people are inspired and 

look up to college athletes and it’s 
important for them to also know 
they have a voice,” Alston said, 
walking down Liberty Street amid 
chants of “No justice, No peace.” 
“And people will listen to it. Com-
ing from a college athlete, more 
people are bound to listen and take 
note of what they say.”

On Sunday, that was the mes-

sage of the day. Really, for these 
athletes, it’s been the message of 
the summer. And watch out, Reyn-
olds says, because the next time 
Michigan Stadium is packed with 
110,000 people, it’s still going to 
be the message — even if he hasn’t 
decided what form that’s going to 
take.

“Anything that’s done, it’s seen 

by millions of people,” Reynolds 
said. “So due to that, any messag-
ing that we have has an opportu-
nity to fall upon many eyes.”

Four years ago, when Colin 

Kaepernick was blackballed by 
the NFL for kneeling during the 
national anthem, doing the same 
would have been unthinkable for 
most college athletes.

But on Sunday, Reynolds wore 

an image of Kaepernick kneeling, 
his afro replaced by the outline of a 
Black Lives Matter fist. And as he 
and so many other athletes made 
their voices heard, the unthinkable 
felt within reach.

Michigan defensive back Hunter Reynolds leads a student athlete Black Lives Matter protest throughout Ann Arbor Sunday afternoon.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

On Sunday afternoon, 

student-athletes 
gathered together. Not 
for practice, not for a 
game or team meeting, 
but for a protest.

The march in support 

of Black Lives Matter 
was a joint effort from 
Michigan and Eastern 
Michigan 
athletes. 

Eagles linebacker Tariq 
Speights and Wolverines 
senior 
defensive 
back 

Hunter Reynolds were 
the official organizers of 
the event. The football 
players are members of 
the group College Athlete 
Unity — an organization 
that aims to “collectively 
address 
injustice 
and 

affect positive change 
using our privilege and 
considerable platforms.” 

“Today, we are going 

to 
unite 
as 
student-

athletes, we’re going to 
unite as a community, 
we’re 
going 
to 
unite 

as fellow brothers and 
sisters,” Speights said 

to 
the 
crowd 
from 

the steps of Hatcher 
Graduate Library. “And 
we will take the first 
steps 
to 
rebuild 
the 

relationship 
between 

African Americans and 
law enforcement in this 
community.”

After 
speeches 

from 
Speights 
and 

Reynolds, 
athletes 

standing on the steps 
next to the organizers 
put on shirts that read 
“RACISM” with a red 
line through the word. 
With megaphones, the 
organizers led a sizable 
crowd out of the Diag 
and onto State St.

“I think the issue is 

important,” Washtenaw 
County 
Sheriff 
Jerry 

Clayton told The Daily. 
“I admire the young 
folks. They have a voice; 
they’re using their voice 
and I want to support 
everything that they’re 
talking about.”

“Before I was sheriff, 

I was a Black man — 55 
years on this planet,” 
Clayton 
said 
to 
the 

crowd 
later 
in 
the 

protest. “As sheriff, I’m 
a Black man. When I’m 
not sheriff anymore, I’ll 
be a Black man. I have 
three sons from 20 to 32 
and my wife and I are 
traumatized every time 
we see another situation 
of a Black person being 
shot, hurt, brutalized, 
not just by the police but 
by society in 
and of itself. 
And 
If 
it 

doesn’t stop 
now, when is 
it ever going 
to stop.”

Amid 

chants 
of 

“No justice! 
No peace!,” 
“Black Lives 
Matter” and 
“Hands up! Don’t shoot!,” 
Ann 
Arbor 
residents 

watched on. The front of 
the protest, spearheaded 
by the athletes, caught 
the eye of those in stores, 
driving by and eating 
lunch. Staring back at 
them were signs held by 
the marchers:

“SKIN 
COLOR 
IS 

NOT 
A 
CRIME,” 
“I 

can’t breathe,” “Black 
Lives 
Matter” 
and 

“White Silence = White 
Compliance.”

After 
rounding 

the final corner onto 
William 
Street 
the 

march made its way back 
to the Diag and people 
took the opportunity to 
speak after Speights and 

Reynolds 
opened 
up 
the 

megaphone 
to everyone.

Morgan 

Iverson, 
an 
Eastern 

Michigan 
track 
athlete, was 
one of the 
first to take 

the stage. Her message 
was clear: vote. Iverson 
urged those attending 
to make a difference in 
their local elections, not 
just presidential.

Following 
her 

announcement, Eastern 
Michigan football coach 
Chris Creighton stepped 
up to take his turn to 
speak.

“Look around and I’d 

imagine 
every 
single 

one of us has somebody 
here in this courtyard 
that we love,” Creighton 
said. “It’s really easy 
when you think about 
it that way to say that 
Black Lives Matter when 
you love someone who’s 
sitting in this courtyard 
right now. It’s a big thing 
in the world right now, 
but it becomes really 
personal and individual 
when you take the time 
to think about the people 
that you’re with, the 
people that you know 
and the people that you 
love.”

LSA 
sophomore 

student Maya Ferguson 
came 
to 
pledge 
her 

support. She expressed 
that she’s tried to do all 
she could this summer 
to support Black Lives 
Matter 
and 
incite 

change and found it most 
important to simply talk 
to people. 

“Social media is such 

a big thing right now,” 
Ferguson said. “So it 
reaches so many people. 

So I really feel like when 
you have conversations 
with people and you 
talk about what’s going 
on sometimes you can 
really change people’s 
perspective or minds.

So many people say 

don’t mix politics with 
sports, 
but 
human 

rights is not politics. It’s 
something that needs to 
be discussed.”

In that, Ferguson and 

the protest’s organizers 
are in harmony. The 
event was advertised and 
spread via social media, 
and the protest was a 
way to create and engage 
people in conversations 
about race and society. 
To the student-athletes 
and people in attendance, 
that is the way forward.

“Trust me, I don’t 

want to hold (this) in all 
to myself,” Speights said. 
“I’ve been doing that my 
entire life. Ask me the 
questions. I’m here, we’re 
all here, we want to have 
those 
conversations. 

We want to break down 
those barriers. We want 
change.”
