After pushback, 
‘U’ continues to 
mull process for 
releasing data

By CAMY METWALLY

Daily Staff Reporter

Over the past few months, the 

University’s course evaluations 
— and whether their results will 
be released to students — have 
become increasingly contentious.

In 
September, 
the 

administration announced plans 
to release the evaluations after 
years 
of 
campus 
discussion 

surrounding 
the 
initiative. 

But the announcement drew 
significant 
pushback 
from 

faculty, leading to an October 
vote 
by 
the 
faculty 
senate 

assembly to support the delay of 
the release, citing concerns with 
the evaluation’s format, among 
other factors. University Provost 
Martha Pollack had said she 
would be willing to adjust the 
timeline for their release based 

on the assembly’s vote.

Two committees have since 

been created to examine both 
the release of the evaluations 
and the instrument employed for 
evaluating courses — re-opening 
conversations about issues like 
question design and response rate 
that faculty have for years.

The current system

Many of the concerns raised by 

faculty and students on both sides 
of the issue aren’t new; they stem 
from how evaluations have been 
used long-term at the University.

For many parties involved, 

course 
evaluations 
have 

important ramifications. For GSIs 
and lecturers, student evaluations 
are a factored into decisions about 
their reappointment. For tenure-
track faculty, they are used in 
conjunction with other evaluation 
mechanisms to determine tenure 
and promotion. Across the board, 
course evaluations are reviewed 
when considering nominees for 
teaching awards.

Cost of attendance, 

discrimination 

continue to present 

challenges at ‘U’

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

The Native American Student 

Association, 
in 
conjunction 

with 
the 
Office 
of 
Multi-

Ethnic Student Affairs, hosted 

a public forum Wednesday on 
contemporary 
issues 
in 
the 

Native American community, 
both within the context of the 
University and at large.

About 30 people attended 

the 
discussion 
held 
in 
the 

Munger Graduate Residences, 
asking questions of the four-
person panel. The night’s panel 
discussion was just one event in a 
lineup organized for November’s 
celebration of Native American 
Heritage Month.

NASA’s co-chair, Isa Gaillard, 

a Public Policy senior, said 
the panel aimed to bolster 
recognition of native students 
both at the University and at 
large.

“We’re looking to increase 

awareness,” 
he 
said. 
“The 

(University’s) relationship with 
(Native Americans) has been 
historically challenged, and a lot 
of that is linked to enrollment 
issues as well.”

Much of the conversation 

focused on obstacles related the 
Native American community’s 

access 
to 
higher 
education. 

Panelist Sandra Momper, an 
associate professor in the School 
of Social Work, said a certain 
stigma still exists surrounding 
Native 
American 
students’ 

ability to succeed in college.

“I was told, ‘You are not 

college material,’ ” she said.

Momper also criticized the 

financial aid afforded native 
students. Even after making 
it to a university, many are 
often dismayed by additional

Classic rock 

musical comes to 
the Power Center 

this weekend

By NATALIE ZAK

Daily Arts Writer

Cue the lights, the curtains and 

the teenage angst: As the actors 
take their positions and the music 
begins, the 
audience 
returns 
to 
their 

adolescence 
where 
confusion 
and tireless 
emotion 
dominated 
every 
thought. 
Addressing 
themes 
of 

sexuality 
and 
abuse 

in 
1890s 

Germany, MUSKET’s “Spring 

Awakening” offers an impressive 
insight into teenagers struggling 
to fend off their inner and real-
world demons.

A 
modern 
rock 
musical 

adapted 
from 
a 
late 
19th 

century German play, “Spring 
Awakening” follows its leads 
through 
sexuality, 
physical 

abuse, diabolical authoritative 
figures, sexual coercion and even 
suicide. There’s little material 
excluded from this profanity-
ridden musical — and that’s one 
of its most appealing qualities. 
Accurately 
and 
explosively 

conveying the bundled emotion 
contained in adolescent minds, 
MUSKET’s production manages 
to be relevant to college students.

“There’s 
suicide, 
there’s 

sexuality, there’s coercion and 
a lot of adolescence,” debut 
director Wonza Johnson said. 
“It’s weird for us to go back to that 
because we’re so old now. As 18, 
19, 20-year-olds, to go back to that 
age of being 15 and experiencing 
this for the first time has been 
challenging.”

 Campaign created to 
oppose temporary 
ban on immigrants 

fleeing Syria 

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

In wake of terrorist attacks 

in Paris that left 129 dead, 
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder 

joined 31 governors in vowing 
to pause the entry of Syrian 
refugees into their states.

Early reports indicated that 

one the attackers may have 
been a refugee from Syria, 
though officials now say that 
theory was likely incorrect. 
Even so, that notion stoked 
fears that ISIS fighters would 
enter the country along with 
the 
refugees 
fleeing 
their 

violent campaigns.

In response, LSA senior 

Sarah Raoof and Public Health 
students Tala Dahbour and 
Reem Kashlan launched a 
letter-writing 
campaign 
on 

Facebook. 
The 
campaign 

encourages students to visit the 
“Share your Opinion” page on 
the governor’s website to send 
either a pre-written or personal 
letter expressing opposition 
to his plan to block Syrian 
refugees.

So far, 190 people have

Two years after the Black 

Student 
Union 
launched 
its 

#BBUM Twitter campaign, the 
challenges brought to light by 
those who used the hashtag to 
share their experiences as Black 
students at the University are 
still fresh in the minds of both 
BSU members and the University 
community.

More 
than 
10,000 
tweets 

racked up within the first two 
days of the hashtag’s launch, and 
soon BSU members were at the 
helm of a movement that quickly 
captivated 
the 
University’s 

attention and garnered media 
coverage nationwide.

Shortly after the launch of the 

hashtag, several BSU members 
held a Martin Luther King Jr.

University Affairs, said faculty 
members’ portfolios also include 
their teaching evaluation scores. 
These portfolios are reviewed by 
executive committees that make 
recommendations to the dean 
for 
performance-based 
salary 

increases.

What the surveys themselves 

look like can differ, sometimes 
significantly, but each starts with 
four University-wide questions, 
commonly known as Q1 through 
Q4. These questions have been the 
focus of current debate because 
they are constant in surveys across 
campus.

Q1 asks students to rate “Overall, 

this was an excellent course.” Q2 
is “Overall, the instructor was 
an excellent teacher.” Q3 asks 
students to evaluate the statement, 
“I learned a great deal from this 
course.” Q4 asks, “I had a strong 
desire to take this course.”

Typically, 
departments 

form the rest of the evaluation 
questionnaire, but professors have 
the ability to add questions as well. 
After including Q1-Q4, faculty 
have the option to choose from 
a catalogue of about 1,300 other 

questions — some are broad while 
others are dedicated to specific 
courses.

Student 
governments 
and 

various departments and schools 
have sent in requests to include 
questions in the catalogue over the 
years. The questions date back to 
1996, and are sorted into different 
categories, 
such 
as 
“student 

development” 
or 
“instructor 

effectiveness,” according to the 
Office of the Registrar.

Political Science Prof. Mika 

LaVaque-Manty, 
who 
has 

conducted research on course 
evaluations for a University task 
force on learning analytics, said 
he’s found that many professors 
don’t deviate from the standard 
survey their department creates.

Szymanksi 
said 
many 

professors pay most attention to 
the first four questions because 
they’re administered across the 
University, making it easy to draw 
comparisons.

“Using the other questions may 

help you design your course better, 
but it’s not going to tell you very 
much about student satisfaction 
overall with your course, relative 
to the other courses that they’re 
taking,” Szymanksi said.

In a November interview with 

The Michigan Daily, University 

Provost 
Martha 
Pollack 
said 

she 
believers 
the 
current 

course evaluation questions are 
satisfactory, 
but 
acknowledged 

that they haven’t been revised for 
some time.

“It’s a good instrument,” she 

said. “We’ve used it for many years, 
but it hasn’t been changed in a 
lot of years. It’s really important 
that we get that right, and so I 
appointed people with expertise in 
educational assessment and so on 
to look at the questions.”

Seeking a purpose

For some involved in the current 

redesign process, the focus isn’t only 
on the questions themselves, but on 
the climate the evaluations foster.

Central Student Government 

president Cooper Charlton, an LSA 
senior, said he thought issues with 
the evaluation system stem from 
flaws in University culture.

“It’s the climate we have on 

campus,” he said. “Students need 
to come to the table willing to 
give constructive criticism … and 
faculty should look at the course 
evaluations as a way for them to 
grow. I think systemically we 
need to work together to build 
a culture where not only course 
evaluations, but higher education 
in general, has a more high-impact 
and collaborative atmosphere.”

SACUA 
Chair 
Silke-Maria 

Weineck, a professor of comparative 
literature, said it could be beneficial 
to include more questions that 
emphasize the two-way dynamic 
between teacher and student.

“I would like the questions to 

also have collaborative aspects 
to bring out the fact that students 
are such an important part of each 
class … (and) make sure that it’s a 
shared enterprise to teach a class,” 
Weineck said.

In 
particular, 
she 
cited 

questions 
about 
a 
student’s 

responsibility in the classroom. 
Other universities, such as the 
University of Washington, use 
student-centric questions in their 
evaluations to assess how much 
effort a student put into the class 
and his or her interest in the 
course material, for example.

Out of the 1,300 total questions 

in 
the 
University’s 
question 

catalog, there are six — added 
in 1996 — that ask students to 
reflect 
on 
their 
participation 

and effort. From these “student 
responsibility” questions, none 
are administered across the entire 

University.

English Prof. David Porter, 

chair of the English Department, 
wrote in an e-mail interview 
that he questions whether the 
release of course evaluations 
would succeed in fulfilling what 
he described as their intended 
purpose — improving course and 
teaching quality.

“Speaking 
from 
personal 

experience, growing into one’s full 
potential as a classroom teacher is 
an ongoing process spanning years 
and even decades, and requiring 
patience, perseverance, and a great 
deal of trial and error,” Porter wrote. 
“To release course evaluation data 
to a broader audience than that for 
which it is intended would not, in 
my view, be helpful in our long-term 
efforts to provide the highest level 
of instruction for students in our 
English courses that we possibly 
can.”

LaVaque-Manty, who supports 

the release of the evaluations, 
said he thought it would be best 
if it didn’t happen in a bubble — if 
faculty provided resources beyond 
evaluations to help students make 
informed decisions about which 
classes they take.

“I wish faculty were more 

diligent 
in 
filling 
out 
better 

descriptions of their courses for the 
course guide,” he said. “I wish in 
LSA they participated in the syllabi 
project, which is making their 
syllabi available for courses … there 
are other data tools in development 
that tell us who’s taking this class, 
what have they taken before, what 
do they go onto take, this would be 
really valuable information. I think 
all of this stuff should be available 
to students.”

Finding a structure

Even if evaluations are released 

or redesigned, faculty and students 
over the past months have identified 
several structural barriers to using 
the data — namely, low response 
rates and bias — that may need to be 
addressed.

In Winter 2015, LSA’s course 

evaluation response rate was at 
approximately 48 percent — the 
lowest in the period from 2008-
2015 according to the Office of the 
Registrar.

Response rates have been on the 

decline for several years, especially 
following the University’s switch 
to electronic evaluations in 2008, 
when response rates have remained 
on average by 15 to 20 percentage 

points lower than with paper 
evaluations.

Acknowledging the importance 

of considering response rates, 
Pollack 
said 
she 
thought 
a 

committee of faculty and students 
should look at the issue after an 
evaluation instrument is finalized. 
The committee’s work is expected 
to conclude in April.

“I think it’s absolutely right to be 

concerned about response rates,” 
she said. “When we use it internally, 
we’re always very cautious to look 
at response rates and what the 
response rates are and what they 
signify.”

Charlton said he thought the 

low response rates might stem 
from the lack of accessibility of 
the evaluations, and the problem 
might self-correct if they are 
released.

“Students don’t think course 

evaluations will help them because 
faculty don’t feel comfortable 
releasing them, so students don’t 
fill them out,” he said. “And when 
students do fill them out, they feel 
obligated to treat them as a joke. 
So we acknowledge that they’re 
low, but the reason they’re low 
is because in reality, they don’t 
provide any value to students.”

Several 
universities 
offer 

incentives for students to submit 
evaluations, many of which are 
tied to access to evaluation data. 
Northwestern University, which 
does 
release 
evaluation 
data, 

has a policy where students who 
don’t fill out evaluations cannot 
gain access to evaluations for the 
upcoming quarter.

In an e-mail interview, Alison 

Phillips, Northwestern’s senior 
assistant registrar, said the policy 
was implemented as an incentive 
to keep response rates at high.

Northwestern’s 
course 

evaluation response rates average 
between 65 and 70 percent, 
noticeably higher than LSA’s 48 
percent.

CSG Communications Director 

Alexandra 
George, 
a 
Public 

Policy junior, said there is a need 
not just for course evaluations 
to be released, but also for a 
better understanding of how and 
where the results will appear, 
which is where an approach like 
Northwestern’s might be helpful.

“I feel that if we were to actually 

release this course evaluation 
data, people would see that it can 
be used,” she said. “If you used it 

to help you pick your classes, why 
would you not pay it forward?”

Other schools, like Michigan 

State 
University, 
withhold 

students’ grades for one week 
if they fail to fill out evaluation 
surveys at the end of the grading 
period.

MSU’s course evaluations are 

not openly published, but MSU 
sophomore Meghan Shelton said 
she believes the policy has had 
a negative impact on quality of 
responses, though it may help 
with quantity.

“I feel like students fill them out 

as fast as they can just to get it over 
with so they can get their grades,” 
Shelton said.

LaVaque-Manty said if the 

University were to adopt such a 
policy, it would be important to 
think of the negative impacts.

“It changes the nature of the 

instrument,” 
LaVaque-Manty 

said. “You would fill it out possibly 
angrily as another task that might 
color your judgment.”

Along with a low pool of data, 

at an Oct. 12 SACUA meeting that 
preceded the Faculty Senate vote 
to delay the release of evaluations, 
faculty also questioned whether 
sexism or racism leads to bias in 
student responses.

LaVaque-Manty said based on 

his research, individual bias due 
to gender and race is evident in 
classrooms, both in open-ended 
comments 
and 
quantitative 

measurements.

However, he also stressed that 

those biases tend to disappear 
from the overall quantitative 
data, except for some instances of 
gender bias appearing when data 
is analyzed at the departmental 
level.

George thinks that overall, 

there is no way to anticipate what 
the impact of releasing course 
evaluation data might be — 
whether that means good or bad 
outcomes. However, she said she 
thinks the outcomes will disprove 
faculty expectations of student 
behavior.

“Right 
now 
when 
I 
fill 

(evaluations) out, I think, ‘Where 
is this going? If I never see it, then 
who’s really looking at this?’ ” 
George said. “I know it’s easy to 
think cynically and to think that 
students would just take advantage 
of it, but I truly believe that if this 
were to be utilized, then everyone 
on campus would use this as a tool.”

Dance senior, is trying his hand 
at direction for the first time. 
Since April, he’s been tirelessly 
planning how to tie this show 
together.

A 
completely 
student-run 

organization, 
MUSKET 
is 

celebrating its 60th anniversary 
this year, and though there were 
a few reservations before settling 
on this risque musical, the pay 
off 
has 
proven 
worthwhile. 

Provided with funding and no 
censorship, MUSKET is free to 
experiment in their productions 
and doesn’t necessarily have to 
exercise caution when deciding 
which show to perform.

However, producer Hillary 

Ginsberg, a fifth-year senior 
double majoring in Business 
and Screen Arts and Cultures, 
and Marketing Director Brett 
Graham, an LSA sophomore 
studying 
political 
science, 

reached out through MUSKET 
to organizations such as Students 
for Choice and the Sexual Assault 
Awareness 
and 
Prevention 

Center to set up in the lobby after 
the show.

“We are trying to make it 

so that we can convey all the 
sexuality and the intensity of 
the show, but at the same time 

people can come see the show 
and leave feeling like they’ve 
learned something — that they’ve 
progressed with the subject 
matter and not that they’ve been 
somehow upset or affronted by 
the show,” Graham said.

With the aggressive nature of 

each pop-punk musical number 
overpowering the eyes, ears and 
mind, “Spring Awakening” is 
an emotionally taxing musical 
for both the audience and cast 
members. Breaking out of the 
narrative and bursting into song, 
the actors use solos to release 
pent up emotion. Songs are used 
less to drive the plot and more as 
a reaction and coping mechanism 
for what the character has just 
experienced.

“It’s the perfect example of 

how musical theater is written 
to escalate a powerful feeling 
to the point where the only way 
to convey it is by bursting into 
song,” said Sarah Eskandari, a 
School of Art & Design freshman.

Will Ropp, a senior in the 

School of Music, Theater & Dance, 
elaborated: “It’s exhausting, but 
in a very artistically fulfilling 
way.”

Playing Melchior, Ropp, along 

with the other male leads, is in 
nine of the 11 musical numbers of 
the first act. Exhausting, indeed.

The multitude of themes, 

characters and storylines that 

transverse over the course of 
the musical creates a unique 
mood relatively unseen before in 
MUSKET productions. Though 
they have produced shows like 
“Sweeney Todd,” “Rent” and 
“Into the Woods” that exist on 
the darker end of the musical 
spectrum, they’re all dwarfed 
in comparison by the shadow of 
angst and pure power exerted 
in “Spring Awakening.” With 
songs 
alternating 
between 

“Totally Fucked” and “The Bitch 
of Living,” no emotion is spared 
and no experience is too delicate 
to be proclaimed in a pop rock 
manner that channels bouts of 
rage, ecstasy and longing into 
every word.

The time and commitment 

of the crew and 17-member 
cast doesn’t go unnoticed by 
witnesses to this musical, even 
before they have stepped foot on 
the Power Center stage.

“Every moment that they have 

experienced in this room is a 
major moment and, even as an 
outsider getting to watch, that 
is so rewarding,” Ginsberg said. 
“I think every single person who 
comes to see this show is going 
to see every single moment of 
hard work they have put into this 
show and how well they have 
developed these characters and 
their incredible story lines.”

signed up to participate, and 
the group plans to set up a table 
in Mason Hall to gather more 
support. Raoof said their efforts 
may include a petition to the 
governor.

“We have received positive 

feedback 
from 
students 
on 

campus and willingness to join 
us in spreading the word,” she 
said.

Dahbour 
said 
feelings 
of 

frustration 
with 
the 
state’s 

unfair treatment of refugees 
inspired the campaign. She also 
said she was disappointed that 
people quickly blamed refugees 
for the Paris terror attacks.

“As refugees are accused of 

the very terror they are trying to 
flee from, we dehumanize them 
and silence their narratives,” she 
said. “They are now being denied 
safety, a basic human right, based 
on their background and/or 
religious affiliation.”

She said refugees already 

have to go through a multi-step 
program to enter the United 
States 
— 
a 
process 
which 

typically takes one to two years 
— and said moves to prevent their 
entry is rooted in prejudice, not 
security.

Business sophomore Sunny 

Demirjian fled Syria as a refugee 
in 2012 with her siblings to 
come to Michigan and live with 
their grandmother. She said the 
transition was difficult and it 
took them about a year to adjust 
to life in the United States. On 
top of that, they were rarely able 
to speak to their parents due 
to difficulties communicating 
with people in the country. 
Demirjian’s parents were able to 
come a few years later.

“It’s very underestimated how 

much immigrants go through 
when they leave their country,” 
Demirjian said. “It’s just such 
a struggle, especially for the 
parents because they are literally 
giving up everything they have 
and even their future to provide 
for their kids, and also for the 
kids.”

Since 
his 
initial 
announcement, 

Snyder has clarified that Syrian 
refugees already in the process 
of coming to Michigan before 
the attacks will not be prevented 
from entering. However, some 
legal scholars say governors 
actually have little authority 
to 
prevent 
refugees 
from 

entering their states, and say 

the decisions are largely made 
by the federal government. In 
September, Snyder said he was 
working with the Department of 
Homeland Security to help with 
the resettlement of refugees in 
Michigan.

On Sunday, his office released 

a statement saying Michigan 
would not accept any refugees 
until the state investigated the 
screening process further. He 
later penned an op-ed in Time 
Magazine 
titled, 
“We 
Must 

Welcome 
Refugees 
— 
After 

Screening Them.”

“I let it be known that 

Michigan can be a place where 
thousands can experience safety 
and freedom—and a growing 
community where they will be 
embraced and comforted by a 
support network,” he wrote. 
“It’s the right thing for us to do 
as Michiganders, and the right 
thing for us to do as Americans. 
But the events of recent weeks, 
including the violence in Paris, 
Beirut and the skies over Egypt, 
remind us of the dangers our 
world faces from extremists 
who are becoming increasingly 
sophisticated in their methods of 
doing us harm.”

History 
Prof. 
Pamela 

Ballinger, whose work focuses on 
the history of human rights, said 
the response is alarming.

“The 
growing 
chorus 
of 

governors who wish to block 
resettlement of Syrian refugees 
in their states is a worrisome, yet 
sadly predictable, response to the 
terror attacks in Paris,” she said. 
“These governors displace blame 
onto 
the 
literally 
displaced, 

victims forced to flee their homes 
as a result of the same extremist 
violence that shook Paris last 
week. Such a view ignores that 
the U.S. commitment to take 
Syrian refugees is already low, as 
well as the fact that the process 
of refugee vetting in the U.S. is a 
slow and careful one.”

Unlike 
proposed 
measures 

in other states, Snyder said 
Michigan’s ban is only temporary, 
and would be revoked after 
the state reviews the federal 
government’s screening process 
for refugees.

“It’s 
disappointing 
that 

Michigan 
Governor 
Rick 

Snyder, whose previous pro-
immigration and pro-refugee 
stances had distinguished him 
from the majority of his fellow 
Republicans, has joined those 
calling for a halt to Syrian 
resettlement,” 
Ballinger 
said. 

“To be fair, Snyder has not 

closed the door on accepting 
refugees, instead urging caution 
and a ‘pause.’ This contrasts 
with those politicians — notably 
New Jersey’s Chris Christie — 
who apparently find even tiny 
orphans a threat. Nor has Snyder 
indulged in the ‘Christians only’ 
rhetoric of Ted Cruz or Jeb 
Bush.”

Law Prof. James Hathaway, 

who directs the Law School’s 
Program 
in 
Refugee 
and 

Asylum Law, expressed similar 
sentiments.

“Governor Snyder’s reluctance 

to welcome Syrian refugees 
to Michigan is very, very sad,” 
Hathaway said. “The United 
States is accepting only an 
incredibly tiny share — less than 
one-fourth of 1 percent — of the 
Syrians who have been forced 
to flee their homes, and who 
are entitled to international 
protection. For so many U.S. 
governors to refuse to do their 
fair share to reach out to these 
victims of brutal violence is just 
shameful.”

Not only does Hathaway find 

it embarrassing for the state, he 
sees the move as a recantation of 
the freedoms the United States 
promises.

“It makes a mockery of their 

commitment to freedom and 
justice for all, as those coming 
are the victims of the brutality 
we say we condemn,” Hathaway 
said. “It is also ridiculous for 
governors to rationalize their 
isolationist posture on security 
grounds, as refugees resettled 
to the U.S. must undergo an 
incredibly 
thorough 
vetting 

process before they are allowed 
to travel here. So let’s condemn 
this action for what it is: knee-
jerk, uninformed and not worthy 
of America.”

However, 
while 
Demirjian 

said she believes refugees should 
be let in, she understands why 
states can’t take in everyone.

“From 
a 
humanitarian 

perspective, I’d say they should 
definitely let the people in,” 
Demirjian said. “However, when 
you look at it from Michigan as 
a state, from their perspective, 
they just want to maintain their 
bounds in terms of how many 
people are there and in terms of 
job availability. They just don’t 
want to gather further burden on 
them because these people are 
coming in looking for resources 
to survive. So makes sense 
logically, but I know it’s not the 
best in terms of a humanitarian 
perspective.”

demonstration on the steps 
of 
Hill 
Auditorium. 
During 

the demonstration, members 
protested 
stagnant 
minority 

enrollment and demanded the 
University meet seven goals for 
improving campus climate and 
diversity of the student body. 
A new location for the Trotter 
Multicultural Center and an 
improved Race and Ethnicity 
requirement were among the 
demands made by the BSU.

The University has since 

addressed 
several 
of 
the 

demands outlined by the BSU, 
however, in a one-year follow-
up with The Michigan Daily in 
January 2015, both University 
administrators and the BSU 
agreed 
increasing 
Black 

enrollment to an amount equal 
to 10 percent was, and still is, 
the most difficult demand to 
address.

University 
alum 
Robert 

Greenfield, 
who 
served 
as 

treasurer of the BSU when 
#BBUM was launched, was 
fundamental in both drafting 
the demands and subsequent 
negotiations 
with 
University 

administrators. In an e-mail 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily, Greenfield looked back on 
the creation of both #BBUM and 
the BSU’s seven demands. 

 
How did #BBUM start? 

What 
was 
the 
catalyzing 

factor 
that 
led 
to 
the 

movement? What sparked it?

Our BSU Executive board 

wanted to start a campaign 
to help mend the fractured 
black community on campus 

— 
particularly 
the 
black 

organizations on campus that 
were at odds with each other. 
Tyrell [Collier], the Speaker 
at the time, came up with the 
“#Being Black at the University 
of Michigan” and Cap [Kendall] 
came up with the abridged 
version “#BBUM.” It was not 
sparked by racist activity on 
campus, though that helped 
it gain momentum — and it 
changed it from a dialogue 
within the black community, 
from 
the 
black 
community 

to a dialogue from the black 
community about the campus 
environment as a whole. A 
catalyzing 
factor 
was 
the 

“Hood 
Ratchet 
Thursday” 

party hosted by the IFC Greek 
fraternity and the worsening 
racial climate nationally. People 
must understand that [the racial 
climate] has always been like 

this (or worse), it’s just that the 
majority ignores it most of the 
time.

How did that movement 

turn into the seven demands?

Once we gained national 

attention, we (had) leverage 
to go back to the U of M black 
community and ask what they 
wanted to have done/fixed. 
Many of the demands are lasting 
agreements that the University 
never came through on (but 
agreed to) — this included the 
10 percent critical mass of black 
students on campus.

Why 
were 
these 
specific 

demands 
chosen 
and 
why 

only 
seven? 
Explain 
the 

reason behind the demands 
and the process leading up to 
the Martin Luther King Day 
demonstrations.

We 
chose 
seven 
because 

they were the most important 
— there is no significance to 
the number itself. The reason 
behind the demands was to 
(for the most part) have the 
University follow through on 
blank promises it made [in the 
past]. The MLK demonstrations 
served as an official unveiling 
of the demands on a day that is 
supposed to be about change 
(not just about remembering the 
past in this “supposed” post-
racial world).

What did negotiations with 
administrators look like? 

What aspects of it stick out in 
your mind? Any difficulties?

It was slow and political. 

Administration 
is 
slow 
(at 

least in my eyes). At times it 
was aggressive. Many of the 
executive board felt like we 
were getting stringed on long 

enough to eventually graduate 
(and so end the movement 
given that activism like this 
unfortunately 
dies 
with 

the 
founding 
activists 
that 

graduate and leave campus). 
The main difficulties were 
convincing 
admissions 
that 

they are doing a poor job with 
black recruitment.

****

Meetings 
between 
the 

University, 
the 
BSU 
and 

community 
members 
are 

still ongoing. Last week, the 
University held a weeklong 
diversity 
summit 
intended 

to 
garner 
input 
from 
the 

community 
on 
improving 

equality 
and 
inclusion 

on 
campus. 
As 
for 
future 

demonstrations from the BSU, 
Greenfield had a short message 
for the University community.

“Stay tuned,” he wrote.

uncovered costs.

“When I first got here, I 

couldn’t 
believe 
the 
living 

conditions of some of the NASA 
students,” she said. “I think 
the University is awesome, but 
they say free tuition and it’s not 
really free. Living expenses are 
so high.”

This semester, the University 

enrolled 
92 
students 
who 

identify as Native Americans. 
Though it’s an increase over 
previous 
years, 
panelists 

agreed the number was still 
too low. University President 
Mark Schlissel’s recent push 
to improve diversity, equity 
and inclusion on campus could 
be doing more to assist Native 
American 
students, 
Gaillard 

said.

“They say they’re open to 

hearing ideas from us, but I 
think they need to realize and 
accept that we’re also students 
… they need to create avenues 
for our voices to be heard,” he 

said.

Aside 
from 
the 

administration’s 
relationship 

to Native American students, 
panelists spoke at length about 
proper engagement with the 
community at large. Because 
the University is located on 
land ceded from a number of 
tribes — the Ojibwe, Odawa, 
and 
Potawatomi, 
Shawnee 

and Wendat all signed treaties 
with territorial governors — 
speakers urged consideration of 
surrounding native populations.

“It starts with getting to 

know (them), asking who they 
are,” said Lynn LaPointe, a 
Lakota tribe member who works 
for the Michigan Department of 
Education. “Whose land is the 
U of M campus on? Being aware 
sounds daunting but it’s really 
not.”

Joseph Gonne, an associate 

professor 
of 
psychology, 

agreed that cultural sensitivity, 
especially 
in 
light 
of 
the 

historical 
tension 
between 

Native Americans and white 
America, is key for allies.

“Come ready to contribute, 

but don’t assume that you know 
what to contribute,” Gonne said. 
“Action and understanding are 
paired together.”

NASA 
looks 
forward 
to 

broadening the organization’s 
scope on and off campus. The 
group played a major role in 
advising the Ann Arbor City 
Council on their decision this 
week to rename Columbus Day 
to Indigenous People’s Day, and 
is hosting more cultural events 
and conversations this month.

MESA 
Associate 
Director 

Linh 
Nguyen 
attended 
the 

panel, and noted the importance 
of the University’s facilitation of 
dialogue on Native American 
students’ needs.

“As we talk about racial issues 

on campus, their perspective 
is nuanced and needs to be 
incorporated,” 
Nguyen 
said. 

“As someone who’s on staff and 
working towards diversity and 
inclusion, experiences like this 
are reminders to me around the 
complexity of how we actually 
address issues like this in terms 
of the diverse students and staff 
that we have.”

#BBUM and Sankofa: Looking Back to Move Forward

ELIZABETH JAMES | MICHIGAN IN COLOR

Today 
marks 
the 
second 

anniversary of the launch of the 
#BBUM 
Twitter 
campaign. 
The 

hashtag and its acronym, which stands 
for Being Black at the University of 
Michigan, was used during one of the 
early precursors to the recent protests 
that are occurring across the nation. As 
a University alum, I fully understood 
what led the students in 2013 to speak 
up and express themselves through 
the use of a Twitter campaign.

This 
university 
has 
long 

experienced various forms of racial 
tension, which isn’t surprising given 
the nation’s ongoing struggles in 
dealing with W.E.B. Du Bois’ brilliant 
assessment of “the problem of the 
color-line.” Michigan is a public 
university that attracts people from all 
over the world, and for many it’s the 
first time they are exposed to new and 
different cultures, which results in 
awkward situations and interactions. 
Being African American in such a 
setting can be particularly frustrating 
because although many of our families 
have been citizens of this country for 
hundreds of years, we still experience 
discrimination, both subtle and overt.

In 2013, members of the Black 

community were deeply affected by 
racist incidents that had occurred on 
campus, and held a Freeze Out on the 
Diag to address these issues. When 
the leadership of the Black Student 
Union came to me as their faculty 
adviser to strategize ways to express 
how they were feeling, I felt a strange 
sense of deja vu.

I remembered the bittersweet 

sound of my mother’s voice speaking 
about how she roomed with other 
young Black women on Catherine 
Street because she wasn’t permitted 
to live in the dormitories. Despite 
her own treatment, my mother took 
great pride in being a Wolverine, and 
encouraged my sister and me to attend 
her alma mater.

My own memories as an alum 

mirrored 
my 
mother’s 
mixed 

emotions during my undergraduate 
and graduate career in the late ‘70s and 
early ‘80s. Back then, I encountered 
confrontations 
in 
the 
classroom 

originating from both faculty and 
other students who would assume 
my presence was due to affirmative 
action. I had actually won a prestigious 
scholarship from the Detroit Institute 
of Arts to study the history of art. 
Constant remarks about being “well-
spoken for someone from Detroit” 
led me to seek solace within the Black 
Student Union and to find safe spaces 
on campus which would affirm and 
empower me, such as the Center (now 
Department) for Afroamerican and 
African Studies.

Discovering racist scrawls on the 

door of my dorm room and seeing 
gorillas hanging in effigy in the Diag 
was devastating, but my mother 
comforted me by explaining that these 
were signs of ignorance and that I was 
at school to awaken and illuminate 
my mind. She, along with empathetic 
faculty 
and 
friends, 
offered 

consolation and noted the benefits 

of attending this University, not the 
least of which that it was a powerful 
introduction to everyday racism. I 
grew stronger and less shocked by 
the behavior I witnessed. Eventually, 
I gained the confidence to find my 
voice, and in speaking up, discovered 
others who shared my perspectives 
regardless of their class, creed or color.

Returning from my memories, I 

listened as the students described 
utilizing the traditional methods of 
mobilization, including wearing black 
as a sign of solidarity, attending the 
Freeze Out: Follow Up Forum to speak 
out for social justice and papering the 
posting wall with statements about 
their experiences.

Then it happened. One of the 

students contacted me and alerted 
me to sign on to Twitter and follow 
#BBUM. What I saw there defied 
description. All of my experiences 
attending the University — both 
positive 
and 
negative 
— 
were 

scrolling past me in a burst of tweets 
that left me breathless.

The use of social media as the 

method of communication within this 
brilliant campaign expanded the range 
of the participants. The tweets began 
with current students, then faculty, 
staff and even administration joined 
the online discussion. Eventually 
alumni chimed in, some like myself 
saddened that many of the same 
situations that we had undergone 
were still happening at the campus 
we had once considered our home. 
The academic in me started analyzing 
the tweets: some were angry, some 
staunch in their support of the 
students, while others stood firmly 
decrying any difference between 
treatment between and among races.

Others sent messages of support 

and solidarity. The numbers grew 
until even the students who began 
the campaign were astonished at 
the ongoing wave of responses. One 
thing was certain: the responding 
Wolverines were honest in their 
appraisal of the time spent in the 
land of maize and blue. There was 
no shortage of opinions from those 
within and outside the campus walls. 
Anyone with access to Twitter could 
participate — and they did!

The media took note and began 

reporting on the hashtag, its meaning 
and the Twitter campaign. People 
from all over the country and beyond 
were sending messages and #BBUM 
went viral. The students involved 
were interviewed by newspapers, 
radio stations and television. It was a 
chaotic time, stressful and relentless, 
but the tweets kept on coming.

The 
West 
African 
Ghanaian 

Adinkra term Sankofa means “return 
and get it,”

or looking back to move forward. 

Prior to and throughout the campaign, 
students researched the previous 
demands presented by the previous 
Black Action Movements on campus. 
In addition, they compiled the coded 
responses from the Twitter campaign 
and created a list of demands. These 
were presented in front of Hill 

Auditorium at the conclusion of the 
MLK keynote speech in January 
2014. The gauntlet had been dropped, 
and the real talk and hard work of 
negotiating for a better, more inclusive 
campus community would begin.

Today, the students continue to 

work with administration on those 
same demands, which ultimately 
is the true sign of a movement, not 
just a moment frozen in time. My 
pride in their tenacity is unwavering, 
and I’m constantly inspired by their 
resilience. On the surface level, some 
progress has occurred in terms of a 
shift in campus climate since #BBUM 
with the powerful conversations 
and mobilization efforts that have 
continued and grown. Part of the 
problem 
stems 
from 
the 
rapid 

response rate and accessible nature 
of the Internet that fueled #BBUM 
also leaves social media open to racists 
who can hide behind pseudonyms. 
Still, I remain staunchly committed to 
a more inclusive University, for as my 
mother wisely advised me, although 
the struggle is daunting, an equitable 
society is the right of every human. 
The promise of a more diverse pool of 
future Wolverines leaves me hopeful 
that the dreams of the first students of 
color who attended Michigan as well 
as those who protested after Martin 
Luther King, Jr. was assassinated will 
one day become reality.

Sidebar: Dr. Ibram Kendi author of 

“The Black Campus Movement,” has 
pointed out the dearth of research 
on the subject of what is deemed 
the Black Campus Movement. He 
notes, “The historical literature on 
the BCM has burst onto the scene 
over the last thirteen years since 
Wayne Glasker’s “Black Students 
in the Ivory Tower” (2002) at the 
University of Pennsylvania and Joy 
Williamson-Lott’s “Black Power on 
Campus” (2003) on the University 
of Illinois. In 2009, Stefan Bradley 
released “Harlem vs. Columbia.” 
In 2010, Fabio Rojas’s “From Black 
Power to Black Studies” appeared

Snyder’s unacceptable response 

Halting the acceptance of Syrian refugees is based in fear, not fact
F

ollowing recent terror attacks in Paris, Beirut and Baghdad, 
31 governors, including Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, 
announced their opposition to accepting Syrian refugees 

into their states. Though the process of admitting refugees isn’t 
within their jurisdiction, the governors’ statements reflect the fear 
of the general populace in light of the harrowing attacks. However, 
these responses are unacceptable, as they’re based in reactionary 
fear, not fact or reason, and vilify refugees who are more directly 
affected by the violence than most Americans. 

Snyder’s response, which he later clarified 

to rather hault accepting refugees until U.S. 
security procedures are reviewed, is especially 
concerning considering that Michigan has the 
largest population of Arab Americans in the 
country. Last week’s attacks directly affected 
his constituents: Among the casualties of the 
Beirut bombing were three Dearborn residents. 
Additionally, Michigan’s immigration rates rank 
among the highest in the country, of all refugees 
in the United States, 4 percent come to Michigan. 
Snyder has previously expressed his support of 
taking in Syrian refugees in the past, noting their 
positive contributions to the economy.

Therefore, Snyder’s remarks seem aimed 

to cater to party opinion — all but one of the 
31 governors who denounced the absorption 
of Syrian refugees were Republicans. As an 
elected official, it’s Snyder’s responsibility to 
advocate for his constituency, not for what his 
party wants to hear at the national level. 

Since 2001, the United States has absorbed 

745,000 refugees. Of that 745,000, only two 
refugees have been arrested under charges of 
terrorism. The people seeking refuge in the 
United States aren’t the ones trying to destroy 
Western culture — they’re trying to flee 
persecution and find a safe environment where 
they can uphold their values and beliefs.

While President Barack Obama’s call for 

the United States to take in 10,000 Syrian 
refugees in the next fiscal year is a step in the 
right direction, it fails to take into account the 
United States’ burdensome asylum process. 
In the past four years, the United States has 
taken in barely 2,000 refugees from Syria, 
with just 200 refugees admitted between 2011 
and 2014. Such slow rates of entrance may 
be attributed to the laborious and incredibly 
strict asylum process for Syrian refugees. It 
can take up to two years for a Syrian seeking 
asylum seeker to finally be granted permission 
to move to the United States. 

A Syrian refugee must apply for asylum 

through the UN or a U.S. embassy, conduct 
face-to-face 
interviews 
and 
participate 

in extensive background checks to prove 
that neither they nor any member of their 
extended family gave so much as a cigarette 
to a member of a “terrorist group” recognized 
by the U.S. government. Such a system 
undermines the principle of “innocent until 
proven guilty” that’s meant to pervade our 
justice system. Such a system perpetuates 
Americans’ fear of foreigners. 

Our politicians’ xenophobia is cause for 

alarm, as the nature of the Syrian refugee hasn’t 
changed in light of these attacks. If anything, 
the attacks make refugees’ escape from the 
Islamic State more urgent.

What’s so abhorrent about the responses 

of our country’s leaders is that they capitalize 
on their constituents’ fear, claiming a stake in 
tragedy to bolster their own political agenda. 
Many 
Republican 
politicians, 
including 

presidential candidate Donald Trump, pegged 
France’s strict gun control laws as a leading 
contributor to the magnitude of the devastation 
in Paris. Republican presidential candidate 
Ted Cruz and other GOP candidates said they 
would allow Christian refugees to settle in their 
states, as if Muslim refugees aren’t disposed to 
the same risks as their Christian counterparts. 

But, since people are afraid, they listen. 

They listen closely. They internalize these 
assertions made under false pretenses and 
create a discriminatory and potentially 
dangerous environment for new immigrants. 
As if it isn’t already hard enough for refugees 
to seek asylum in the United States, those who 
make the cut quickly find that they have come 
to a country where they will be marginalized 
by merit of where they come from, not their 
own personal beliefs. 

This baseless discrimination clashes with 

the values of acceptance of others and of 
religious and cultural freedom that America 
stands for. Snyder should take note of these 
facts in order to foster a state in which all 
residents, whether they were born here or 
not, can exercise their rights without fear of 
unfounded prejudice. 

Containing terrorism

W

e have all heard about the gruesome 
ISIS terrorist attacks in Paris on the 
evening of Nov. 13. These attacks 

took the lives of at least 
129 victims and injured 
hundreds more. They were 
the first attacks that ISIS 
carried out in Europe.

ISIS, also known as the 

Islamic State, has long 
communicated its intent 
to expand terror from the 
Middle East to Europe 
and the United States. 
ISIS has had the ability to 
attack in Europe and the 
United States for far too 
long because of its large number of foreign 
recruits (estimated to be around 30,000 by a 
United States intelligence report) who have 
the agency to re-enter their home countries 
and launch attacks.

However, U.S. President Barack Obama has 

consistently chosen to be reactionary toward 
ISIS as opposed to combating the threat itself. 
Since Aug. 8, 2014, the United States has been 
launching airstrikes against the Islamic 
State in Iraq. The airstrikes are a reaction to 
its startling territorial gains, including the 
acquisition of Mosul, the second-largest city 
in Iraq, in June 2014.

The beheadings of American journalists 

James Foley and Steven Sotloff helped to 
prompt the expansion of airstrikes into Syria 
in September 2014. These airstrikes haven’t 
sufficiently stabilized the region, considering 
that ISIS thrives in conquered areas with a large 
number of Arab Sunni populations and that the 

organization has attracted recruits from nearly 
80 countries. ISIS has been very active in the 
last few weeks. Besides the terrorist attacks in 
Paris, ISIS claimed responsibility for a suicide 
bombing in Baghdad that killed 19 people on 
Nov. 13, suicide bombings in Beirut that killed 
43 on Nov. 12, and for the deaths of 224 on a 
Russian aircraft that crashed on Oct. 31.

Despite these extensive attacks by ISIS, 

Obama maintained his view that current 
efforts against ISIS are sufficient at the recent 
G-20 summit in Turkey. He was asked about 
underestimating the Islamic State, if the United 
States should send more troops to Syria and 
about elusive success combatting ISIS. When 
asked if American policy should increase 
forces in Syria, he stated, “We would see a 
repetition of what we’ve seen before, which 
is if you do not have local populations that are 
committed to inclusive governance and who 
are pushing against ideological extremes, that 
they resurface, unless we’re prepared to have a 
permanent occupation of these countries.”

It seems to me that Obama provides an excuse 

for not sending ground troops by suggesting 
that he doesn’t want to repeat former President 
George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq. Obama 
believes that the invasion of Iraq in 2003 failed 
to create stability in the region because the 
locals weren’t prepared to combat extremism. 
It’s true that the locals were unprepared to 
combat extremism, but they were unprepared 
to do so in the wake of a hasty United States exit 
from the region in 2011.

David Ignatius summarizes the situation in 

an article for The Atlantic, “How ISIS Spread 
in the Middle East.” Ignatius describes how 
attempts by the United States or Islamist rebels 

ASHLEY 

AUSTIN

to topple authoritarian regimes in the 
Middle East create power vacuums. 
Extremists will fill the political 
vacuums if the United States and its 
allies don’t build strong local forces 
that can suppress terrorist groups.

The 
United 
States 
must 
be 

persistent in its efforts to aid the local 
forces — if it withdraws too soon as it 
did from Iraq in 2011 under Obama’s 
orders, terrorists will seize power. 
Iraqi forces weren’t ready for the 
withdrawal of American troops, and 
Obama’s policymakers chose to look 
the other way for too long as ISIS 
spread between 2011 to 2014. From 
2014 onward, the United States has 
sought to only contain the threat of 
ISIS through airstrikes — not the full 
military engagement necessary to 
topple the Islamic State.

ISIS is only becoming stronger, 

and it’s time to eliminate the threat 
of terrorism once and for all in the 
Middle East. For the last 14 years, 
the United States has been involved 
in proxy wars in the Middle East 
that haven’t sufficiently eliminated 
violent extremism its perpetrators 
seek to spread everywhere. We 
have lived in a world constantly 
threatened by terrorism for most 
of our lives, provoking fear in many 
of us. Whenever I attend sporting 

events, fly on an airplane or board 
a train, there’s always that fleeting 
second in which I think back to 9/11 
and other terrorist attacks. I never let 
this fear dictate my actions, but it’s a 
fear that I cannot escape.

There are few places in the world 

that extremists don’t seek to attack, 
and I know that my fear isn’t unique to 
being an American. I sometimes think 
back to my harrowing experience 
on an overnight cruise between 
Italy and Greece in 2008. When on 
the cruise, we were informed that 
there had been a terrorist threat and 
potential bomb placed on board of 
the ship. It was difficult to surmise 
the details of the threat announced 
on the loudspeakers because the 
announcements came first in four 
other languages before English. 
Passengers spoke in panicked voices 
over the announcements.

I remember my mother holding 

my hand and leading me back to the 
room that I shared with my sister. 
Italian police officers and bomb 
squads raided every room on the ship, 
including the room that I shared with 
my sister. I became hyperaware of 
how trapped and vulnerable I was on 
this ship in the middle of the Adriatic 
Sea, so far from home. My last 
memories of this experience include 

looking out a porthole at the topaz 
sea and wondering how such hatred 
could exist. Evidently, there was no 
bomb on board, but this experience 
taught me that terrorism has a broad 
affect that can touch you anywhere 
in this world.

Terrorism cannot be contained 

to the Middle East; it will extend 
itself to strike us when we least 
expect it. The time has come for 
more 
extensive 
attacks 
against 

ISIS in Iraq and Syria that may 
have to include ground troops. 
The Islamic State is far from being 
contained as Obama stated it to 
be on the morning of Nov. 13 in a 
“Good Morning America” interview 
and maintains presently. Al-Qaeda 
and its outgrowth, ISIS, have been 
terrorizing their own societies and 
the world for the last 14 years, and 
they have the capability to continue 
to do so.

The reality is that we must demand 

policies that recognize that this 
group is a top threat to our ability 
to live in a democracy and a world 
where civilians don’t have to fear 
assassination just because they don’t 
adopt Islamic extremist ideology.

Deep lineup forces 
‘M’ to limit errors

Wolverines label 
2015-16 ‘year of 
accountability’

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

Midway through the second 

half of the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s season opener, 
Duncan Robinson entered the 
game for the Wolverines. 

One minute and 18 seconds 

later, the redshirt sophomore 
guard was back on the bench. 

The 3-point specialist wasn’t 

injured, he wasn’t tired, and he 
didn’t do anything wrong that 
showed up in the post-game box 
score. What Robinson had done, 
though, was completely miss his 
defensive assignment, and that 
was enough for Michigan coach 
John Beilein to yank him from 
the game in favor of redshirt 
freshman D.J. Wilson. 

Beilein’s quick hook made 

several appearances throughout 
the 
Wolverines’ 
first 
two 

contests of the season against 
Northern Michigan and Elon, 
with inexperienced players like 
Robinson and Wilson often on 
the receiving end. 

Through the first two games, 

Michigan’s rotation has been 12 
players deep. And though Beilein 
has said it won’t stay that way, 
there is no room for individual 
error on a team with that much 
depth. With so many players 
available, Beilein has had the 
luxury of trying every lineup 
imaginable against the team’s 
lackluster 
early 
opponents, 

and he has no reason to leave 
struggling players on the floor. 

“We’re just trying to feel out 

what’s best for us,” said junior 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. “This 
year is a year of accountability, 
so at any moment, you make a 
mistake, a guy can come in and 
replace you. (You have to) do 
what you need to be doing.”

 Walton — who posted 24 

points, seven assists and six 
rebounds in the victory over 
Elon — and preseason All-Big 
Ten 
senior 

guard 
Caris 

LeVert 
likely 

won’t 
be 
in 

danger 
of 

losing playing 
time, 
but 

just 
about 

everyone 
else 
on 
the 

roster is being 
constantly 
evaluated, 
both in games and in practice. 

“Every 
day, 
we’ve 
been 

keeping charts,” Beilein said. 
“We know who’s won every 
single game (in practice). ... 
We’ve been on that. There’s been 
times though, still, that I thought 
our progress has been really 
slow — way too slow. We’ve been 
holding everybody accountable. 
We’ve had subs ready to come 
(in), but our learning curve’s got 
to increase.”

 
Last 
season, 
this 
kind 

of 
lesson 
in 
accountability 

wasn’t possible. With Walton 
and LeVert out with injuries, 
freshman 
guards 
Aubrey 

Dawkins and Muhammad-Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman were forced 
into starting roles knowing 
full well there were few others 
behind them on the depth chart. 
Freshman 
mistakes 
on 
the 

court — from blown defensive 
coverage to poor shot selection 

— were unavoidable and often 
excused. 

But now, Beilein has the 

ability to reward, punish and 
experiment at will, and that 
fact is readily apparent in the 
number of lineup combinations 
he has thrown on the court. 

The ‘5’ position has been a 

revolving door. Though junior 
Mark Donnal has started both 

games, Wilson, 
sophomore 
Ricky 
Doyle 

and freshman 
Moritz 
Wagner 
have 

seen plenty of 
action. 
And 

at one point 
against 
Elon, 

the Wolverines 
fielded 
an 

atypical lineup 

of 
Walton, 
Abdur-Rahkman, 

junior 
forward 
Zak 
Irvin, 

Robinson and Wilson.

 “The different types of 

rotations, I don’t think it’s really 
throwing any guys off, it’s just — 
we’re so versatile,” Walton said. 
“We’ve got guys that can play 
left side, backcourt and the ‘5,’ 
so I think it’s a luxury to have so 
many guys that can play so many 
positions.” 

Though players like Dawkins 

and Abdur-Rahkman have played 
meaningful minutes early in their 
careers, Beilein now faces the 
challenge of getting them ready 
to play when expectations are 
higher. With LeVert and Walton 
fully healthy, the Wolverines have 
lofty goals to accomplish. 

“We can’t just keep bumping 

our head on the ceiling,” Beilein 
said. “We’ve got to push through 
that, and several of our guys 
haven’t been able to do that.”

Tough Xavier team 
will test Michigan

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

Though 
last 
weekend’s 

opponents, 
Binghamton 
and 

Detroit, didn’t pose much of a 
threat to the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team, a much 
deeper 
Xavier 

squad certainly 
could.

After 
an 

exhausting 
two games in 
two days, the 
Wolverines 
(2-0) had the 
chance to regroup, watch film 
and prepare ahead of their most 
difficult test yet.

“They’re pretty deep, and that 

is something we haven’t faced 
in the first two games,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
in a WTKA interview on Tuesday. 
“I think we wore the opponents 
out in the first couple games, 
because we kept rotating in and 
changing defenses. (Xavier) goes 
10, 11 deep.” 

The box score from Xavier’s 

65-57 win against Evansville 
reveals that wide distribution 
of playing time. Eight different 
Musketeers played more than 
15 
minutes 
in 
their 
season 

opener, compared to just seven 
for Michigan against Detroit. 
But while 10 of Xavier’s players 
contributed to the scoring, only 
one put up double digits.

Xavier 
guard 
Raeshaun 

Gaffney scored 18 points in her 
first game after transferring from 
Virginia. She is the team’s best 
weapon, but Xavier will need 
more than a single source for 
scoring, or else the Musketeers 
will have a high mountain to 
climb to get past a Michigan team 
that had four players reach double 
digits in each game.

Led 
by 
freshman 
center 

Hallie Thome and sophomore 
guard Katelynn Flaherty, the 

Wolverines 
have 
cruised 
in 

their previous outings, winning 
by scores of 90-62 and 88-61. 
Feeding the 6-foot-5 Thome 
in the post continues to be a 
successful tactic, and her 21 
points and three blocks in 
Detroit prove she is shaping up 
to be a valuable addition.

Both games’ second halves 

featured Michigan continuing 
to expand on early leads, which 
allowed Barnes Arico to bring in 
players who typically won’t see 
game time down the stretch. As 
a result, it’s difficult to perceive 
how deep Michigan actually is. 
Regardless, it has played like a 
talented, 
well-rounded 
group, 

despite the guard-heavy lineup.

Nine of the roster’s 14 players 

are guards, but so far there hasn’t 
been any special emphasis on a 
four-guard system, or really any 
system for that matter.

“When we sub, we really don’t 

lose anything,” Barnes Arico 
said. “Sometimes we change our 
defenses at that point as well. 
We’re kind of like a football 

team right now, where we have 
different packages depending 
on who’s going into the game. 
We’ve had a press package, a 
three-quarter court package, 
full-court press, a half-court 
man defense.”

Changing the defense on the fly 

appears to be Michigan’s greatest 
strength. After initiating the full-
court press during the second 
quarter 
against 
Detroit 
last 

weekend, the Wolverines forced 
four turnovers in three minutes to 
build an 11-point lead.

After that game, Barnes Arico 

mentioned that picking starters is 
often a game-time decision, calling 
it a “battle” for the five spots.

Nonetheless, Xavier can likely 

match Michigan well in this 
department.

The Wolverines’ early success 

may 
be 
boosted 
by 
weaker 

competition. It’s far too early 
to make any claims about this 
Michigan team, but if it pulls off 
another landslide victory against 
Xavier, a clearer picture for the 
season might start to take shape.

Schlissel talks Yale, 
Mizzou aftermath

‘U’ officials discuss 
campus dialogues 

regarding race

By LARA MOEHLMAN

Daily Staff Reporter

After 
college 
campuses 

confronted issues of diversity 
and racial tensions last week, 
particularly on the campuses of the 
University of Missouri and Yale 
University, The Michigan Daily 
sat down with University officials 
to discuss how the University 
campus talks about race.

The 
conversation 
followed 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s campuswide diversity 
summit, which was held the 
week before Thursday’s two-
year anniversary of the #BBUM 
Twitter campaign.

During the interview, Schlissel 

emphasized what he characterized 
as 
the 
University’s 
proactive 

strategy for handling issues of 
race, in comparison with how 
similar issues were handled on the 
campuses of Missouri and Yale.

“We didn’t launch the diversity, 

equity and inclusion strategic 
planning process in the setting of 
a crisis,” he said. “We launched 
it in the setting of an ongoing 
commitment to the public and the 
students that we serve and to build 
an inclusive community.”

University administrators have 

been in the process of creating a 
plan to address issues related to 
diversity throughout the year.

Robert Sellers, vice provost for 

equity, inclusion and academic 
affairs, 
said 
this 
mindset 

distinguishes the University from 
other institutions grappling with 
conversations on race and inclusion.

“We hope that the level of 

conversation is perhaps different 
from what happened at Missouri, 
that students feel that they have 
a partnership in trying to make 
this change with respect to the 
administration, that we’re in this 
together, that they don’t see it 
simply as it’s our job to change the 
University, but it’s all our jobs,” 
Sellers said.

The 
day 
after 
Schlissel’s 

diversity 
assembly, 
students 

also gathered on the Diag in 
solidarity with Black students at 
the University and Missouri. The 
timing of these events, Schlissel 
said, was impactful.

“The coincidence in timing 

was dramatic, and it allowed us to 
have even deeper, more important 
discussions, perhaps, that we 
might have absent at all these other 
events,” he said. “The commitment 
to this is ongoing. It started before 
and it will continue on because the 
challenges are ongoing.”

“I hope that we don’t end up in 

a situation where it’s us against 
‘them,’ because we see ‘them’ as 
us, and there is no ‘them,’ ” Sellers 
added.

Schlissel said the diversity 

summit, which was attended by 
1,100 students, staff and faculty, 
presented an opportunity for 
increased inclusiveness.

“Many people in our community 

don’t feel like they’re full, active 
participants, 
and 
they’re 
not 

accorded the same sense of 
inclusion in our community as 
others, and a sense of hurt and a 
little bit of anger came through,” 
Schlissel said. “And I think that 
was very important for all of us to 
hear, and to try to understand and 
to contextualize with our ongoing 
work on diversity and inclusion.”

In 
Tuesday’s 
interview, 
E. 

Royster Harper, vice president 
for student life, discussed the 
University’s established history of 
activism.

“This is the school that went 

to the Supreme Court,” Harper 
said. “It’s also an institution where 
students’ voices around change 
and imagining a different kind 
of world have always been part 
of our DNA, and we’ve always 
had a responsive administration, 
sometimes 
imperfectly, 

but 
always 
a 
responsive 

administration … Does that 
mean we’re there? Absolutely 
not. But I also keep trying to 
remind myself that we’re also 
not at the starting gate either.”

Two 
years 
after 
the 

University’s 
Black 
Student 

Union launched the #BBUM 
Twitter 
campaign 
to 
call 

attention to the experiences of 
Black students on campus, both 
administrators 
and 
students 

say their is more work to do to 
address the challenges faced 
by these students. #BBUM was 
launched on this day in 2013.

Baxter adjusts to drama

Michigan’s special 
teams still strong 
after three miscues 

in four games

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

While the Michigan special 

teams unit has been one of the 
team’s strengths this season, 
it has weathered some drama 
lately.

There 
was, 
of 
course, 

the dropped punt snap that 
Michigan State picked up and 
returned for a touchdown and a 
27-23 win at Michigan Stadium 
— “the fluke of all flukes,” as 
special teams coordinator John 
Baxter described it Wednesday. 
But besides that, there have been 
numerous disruptions to the unit 
throughout the year.

Baxter’s job is to respond to 

them, and though he has had an 
answer to almost every one, they 
pose challenges nonetheless.

“This is my 30th college 

football season, and when you 
think you’ve seen it all, don’t 
worry, something else is coming,” 
Baxter said. “It’s a game with 
really neat young people and a 
ball that’s not round, and that’s 
what creates the drama.”

The 
special 
teams’ 

improvement 
under 
Baxter 

has been exceptional. The unit 
has made several big plays to 
change the dynamic of games, 
and the coaching staff has 
rewarded them. Tuesday night, 
redshirt 
junior 
cornerback 

Jeremy Clark walked into a 
media session wearing a special 
teams shirt with the phrases “Be 
The Hammer” and “Leverage. 
Acceleration. Intimidation.”

“Whenever a player does a 

great job on special teams, we 
find one of these in our locker,” 
said Clark, who is on the kick 
return and punt return teams.

The Wolverines were ranked 

No. 1 in the country in special 
teams 
efficiency 
during 
the 

middle of the season, but they 
have dropped to 16th after 10 
weeks. While the unit has tied 
up most loose ends, the fall in 
the rankings comes as a result of 
three big plays, each surrendered 
in the past four games.

On Nov. 7, Michigan allowed 

a 98-yard kickoff return for a 
touchdown by Rutgers’ Janarion 
Grant. Senior kicker Kenny Allen 
has booted almost half (29 of 61) 
of his kicks for touchbacks, but 
a low line drive in that instance 
created the opportunity for an 
explosive play.

Two 
other 
factors 
also 

contributed, though: the natural 
skill of Grant, who already has 
four return touchdowns this 
season, and the wind that kept 
Allen’s kick low. Baxter has to 
adjust to both — Grant is among 
the Big Ten’s best return men, 
and the Midwestern weather 
often makes wind an influence, 
too.

The 
following 
week, 
the 

Wolverines traveled to Indiana 
and suffered another setback 
when the Hoosiers’ Mitchell 
Paige returned a punt 51 yards 
for a touchdown on the first 
possession of the second half. 
Baxter attributed that mistake 
to fatigue — Michigan appeared 
to have Paige wrapped up but let 
him escape.

“In 
the 

game, 
you’ve 

got to tackle, 
and 
when 

you 
get 
the 

opportunity to 
tackle, you’ve 
got to tackle,” 
Baxter 
said. 

“It’s 
really 

difficult 
to 

ever 
embrace 

an attitude of tired, beat up 
or 
whatever 
else, 
because 

in November, in this game, 
everybody is.”

In addition to week-to-week 

preparations, Baxter’s personnel 
has been adjusted, as with any 
unit. Before the Rutgers game, 
redshirt freshman safety Jabrill 
Peppers moved away from the 
kick-return unit to focus more 

on 
offense, 

and 
junior 

cornerback 
Jourdan Lewis 
replaced him.

Last 
week, 

redshirt 
sophomore 
long 
snapper 

Scott 
Sypniewski 
traveled 
separately 

from the team to avoid spreading 
an illness. He made one bad 
snap that cost Michigan a field 
goal but played the entire game 

as usual.

“It’s a general policy not to 

talk about players’ (health), but 
I can say this: That kid gutted 
it out for this football team as 
much as I’ve ever seen a guy 
do it,” Baxter said. “He had 
a 
103-(degree) 
temperature, 

couldn’t keep anything down all 
the way through pregame and 
literally kept reducing that game 
down to five-minute segments.”

Those 
kinds 
of 
surprises 

invariably crop up throughout 
the season, but on special teams, 
even small ones can create 
breakdowns.

“We’ve had three negative 

plays go against us, which is 
unfortunate because it only takes 
one negative play to really put a 
damper on a really nice body of 
work,” Baxter said. “But that’s 
the nature of sports, I guess.”

Jourdan Lewis has taken on some kick return duties to relieve Jabrill Peppers.

“It’s a game with 
really neat young 
people and a ball 
that’s not round.”

VOLLEYBALL
Michigan upsets 
No. 4 Penn State

By PAIGE VOEFFRAY

For the Daily

Last weekend, the Michigan 

volleyball team got a taste of 
what it felt like to beat a ranked 
opponent. 
This 
week, 
the 

Wolverines wanted more, and 
they got it while also making 
history.

Wednesday night, Michigan 

took on No. 4 Penn State (13-4 
Big Ten, 24-4 overall). After 
struggling in the first set, the 
Wolverines (8-9, 18-10) came 
back stronger and managed to 
pull off the upset with a 3-1 win, 
marking their first-ever win in 
State College.

“In my four years, we haven’t 

beaten them at all, so it was 
definitely a great win,” said 
senior 
setter 
Carly 
Warner. 

“It’s hard to believe it actually 
happened, especially at their 
gym, which is really hard to do.”

Warner 
led 
the 
defense 

with 19 digs and helped lead a 
Michigan offense to victory in an 
old-fashioned shootout with the 
Nittany Lions. Penn State scored 
22 points or more in all four sets, 
but junior middle blocker Abby 
Cole’s team-high 17 kills helped 
the Wolverines hold on for their 
first victory over the Nittany 
Lions since 2002.

Michigan 
started 
slowly 

while Penn State opened the 
match with momentum. The 
Wolverines found themselves 
down 7-3, forcing coach Mark 
Rosen to take the team’s first 
timeout. Michigan couldn’t find 
a rhythm to take the lead, so the 
Wolverines took a second timeout 
as the Nittany Lions led 15-6. In 
the end, though, they couldn’t 
regroup against a relentless 
offensive and defensive effort by 
Penn State, which took the first 
set 25-14.

In 
the 
second 
set, 
the 

Wolverines finally took their first 
lead, 23-22, and kept firing to win 
the next two points and take the 
set, 25-22.

“We were all of a sudden kind 

of down, and that put us on our 
heels a little bit,” Rosen said. “We 
did a great job in the second set 
of just being steady and really 
raising our level as the set went 
on. I give a lot of credit to our 
players for being strong enough 
to do that.”

The Wolverines tried to carry 

their momentum from the second 
set into the third as they began 
the frame with a 5-1 lead. They 
maintained that lead, but the 
Nittany Lions stayed close and 
eventually tied the game at 20.

Penn State appeared to take 

the lead on the next play, but 
Michigan protested that a fan 
interfered, forcing the officials 
to meet before ultimately calling 
back the point. Luckily for 
the Wolverines, it gave them a 
second chance to dominate the 
rest of the set and win by three.

The Nittany Lions were the 

first team to find a rhythm in the 
fourth set, gaining an early lead 
of 11-7. Michigan began to fall 
further behind but eventually 
came out of a timeout fired up 
and tied the game at 15 before 
winning five straight points.

Trying to battle back, Penn 

State coach Russ Rose took 
another timeout while trailing 
21-18 in an attempt to try and 
derail the Wolverine offense. But 
Michigan refused to be stopped 
and took the fourth set, 25-21, for 
the victory.

The Wolverines’ win streak 

over ranked teams comes at 
a crucial point of the season, 
after four straight losses. With 
its latest spurt of momentum, 
Michigan has set itself up nicely 
for a match against Nebraska on 
Saturday at Crisler Center.

From Boston to Michigan, 
Powers reflects on career

By JUSTIN MEYER 

Daily Sports Writer

Billy 
Powers 
wasn’t 
ever 

supposed to put on a Michigan 
hockey uniform.

The 
Wolverines’ 
assistant 

coach grew up in Somerville, 
Mass., a brick-lined, working class 
suburb of Boston. During the early 
’80s, as plants were shuttered 
and 
Somerville’s 
economy 

collapsed, Powers played for one 
of the nation’s premier teams at 
Matignon High School.

Half 
of 
his 
high 
school 

teammates joined elite college 
programs after graduation, but 
the top recruiters never came 
calling for Powers. Disappointed 
by the slight and with a chip on his 
shoulder, he headed to St. Anselm 
to play Division II hockey.

There, Powers turned heads 

with a spectacular season. As 
schools dangled offers following 
his freshman campaign, Powers 
faced 
an 
unusual 
decision. 

Michigan had called, offering him 
the opportunity to head west to 
play hockey.

Powers had never particularly 

wanted to leave Boston. None of 
his high school teammates had left 
the Northeast — Powers thinks the 
furthest any player traveled was 
to Colgate, in upstate New York 
— and practically no one he knew 
lived outside the Boston area.

Boston has a particular loyalty 

about it. The idea of being a 
Bostonian is glorified through pop 
culture, tough-guy stares and the 
city’s sports franchises. For many, it 
is hard to imagine living anywhere 
else. Fewer than 14 percent of 
people move from Powers’ county, 
Middlesex, in any given five-year 
period — among the nation’s lowest 
rates for large populations.

Kids from Boston just don’t 

want to leave Boston.

But in 1985, Powers got on 

a plane to the Midwest for 
a 
recruiting 
visit 
with 
Red 

Berenson. He hasn’t left since.

Thirty years later, you could 

almost say he is a Midwesterner.

“Was it planned? Absolutely 

not,” Powers said. “Just coming 
out here as a student-athlete was a 
pretty shocking experience for my 
family.

“My 
recruiting 
trip 
to 

Michigan, if it wasn’t my parents’ 
first time on a plane, it was like 
their second. East Coast people 
are pretty territorial. Most people 
don’t leave.”

The 
forward 
made 
an 

immediate 
impact 
for 
the 

Wolverines, netting 43 points in 
his first season. In the fall of 1985, 
shortly after his arrival in Ann 
Arbor, Powers told The Michigan 
Daily that his decision to play for 
Berenson was easy.

“Back East, I figured they 

had their shot (right out of high 
school), and they messed up if they 
wanted me.”

Today, Powers can laugh at the 

prideful 20-year-old kid. Because 
of that decision, though, he is still 
competing against the storied 
programs from back home. This 
week, Michigan will play the 
highest-profile series of its young 
season at No. 10 Boston University. 
Powers will have 20-odd friends 
and family in attendance.

The battle he relishes most, 

though, is the fight in the 
recruiting trenches each season — 
one in which he’s a veteran.

When 
Powers 
joined 
the 

Wolverines in the ’80s, big-name 
recruits on the East Coast never 
thought about heading west to 
play hockey. Helping to bridge the 
recruiting gap is one of Powers’ 
most cherished accomplishments.

His story of moving away from 

home and taking a chance at 
Michigan lends him credibility 
with players and their families.

“You have to pick your battles,” 

Powers said. “I wouldn’t want to get 
in too many fights with (Eastern) 
schools over Eastern kids. But the 
prep-school kid, the Connecticut 
kid, the New York kid, somebody 
that hasn’t grown up in the greater 
Boston area — I think Michigan 
will always have a great chance no 
matter who we go against.”

The Wolverines have their 

first opportunity for a statement 
win this weekend. For Powers, it 
is only another page in his long 
relationship 
with 
East 
Coast 

hockey. Boston is still home and 
always will be. But Powers did 
make a final promise.

“(My family is) converted — 

there’s no doubt there,” he said. 
“My entire section will be maize 
and blue.”

From Boston kid to Michigan 

recruiter, Powers certainly found 
his calling.

All traditions need updates, 
though it’s usually the strongholds 
of American culture that resist 
change. I’m talking about 
Thanksgiving, a holiday that has 
not aged well in the eyes of a 
modern post-colonial, secular and 
multicultural citizen. Iffy roots 
aside, turkey is a real drag. It’s 
usually too dry, mostly pumped 
with hormones and always the time 
suck of preparation — and that’s 
not even touching on ethical issues. 
That’s why we here at The Daily 
skipped the turkey and tweaked the 
side dishes, crafting a set of small 
plates that draw their inspiration 
from flavors of fall. We kept the 
flavors of traditional dishes and 
changed the form — putting roasted 
squash onto crostini, updating 
classic green bean casserole with 
fried shallots and cashews instead 
of dairy, and giving potatoes a new, 
crispy medium.

Farmer’s market is 
worth the lost sleep

By CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

On any given Saturday, there’s 

a high chance I won’t be able to 
drag myself out of bed before 
noon. Last Friday night, despite 
my 
body’s 
anticipated 
extra 

resting hours, I set my alarm 
for 10 a.m. and changed the 
beat of my circadian rhythm 
in preparation for Kerrytown’s 
well-attended weekend affair: 
the Ann Arbor Farmers Market. 
Yet, 
by 
seasoned 
shopper 

standards, I was late to the party.

According to market manager 

Sarah DeWitt, a recognizable 
crop of local epicureans and 
Main Street chefs tend to arrive 
at 7 a.m. sharp. 

Along 
with 
beating 
the 

laggard crowd, the regulars 
alternate between chatting with 
farmers, inspecting produce and 
carting away wholesome treats 
in massive boxes and chef pans.

“There are fewer Ann Arbor 

restaurants not stopping down 
here,” DeWitt said. 

Maggie Long, Jolly Pumpkin 

chef and managing partner, is 
always among the early birds 
toting her handcart.

“She refuses to give up 

market 
mornings 
because 

she wants to keep that face 
time, connection and sense of 
community with the different 
farmers,” said Chirs North, 
Jolly Pumpkin floor manager.

For 
nearly 
a 
century, 

sustaining 
a 
sense 
of 

community among shoppers, 
local businesses and farmers 
has been the essence of the 
market. A majority of the 

veteran 
vendors 
are 
either 

second- 
or 
third-generation 

farmers whose relatives began 
selling at the original location 
near Main Street in 1919. The 
current market was erected 
in the 1930s by the Works 
Progress Administration and 
is situated on Detroit St. in the 
heart of Kerrytown.

Today, 
the 
market 
is 

“producers 
only,” 
meaning 

all items for sale are made 
or grown by vendors with no 
resale. It’s stipulated within 
the market rules that those 
who sell products must grow 
their items in Michigan or an 
abutting state.

Accordingly, 
nearly 
all 

vendors are within an hour 
radius, 
with 
the 
exception 

of Donna Puehler, owner of 
Grandma’s Kitchen in Ohio. 
For three decades, Puehler 
has been a beloved provider 
of baked goods and eggs, and 
simply known as “grandma” to 
frequent market-goers.

At present, the market offers 

the products of more than 
60 produce and diversified 
produce farmers — those who 
sell 
additional 
items 
such 

as 
greenhouse 
flowering 

plants along with fruits and 
vegetables — 30 artisan vendors 
and 
a 
few 
specialty 
food 

vendors. Essentially, it’s the 
one-stop shop for everything 
from leather handbags to maple 
syrup to the recent addition 
of Fluffy Bottom Creamery’s 
yogurts and cheeses.

“We aim to maintain a 

variety,” DeWitt said. “We try 
to cater to all product niches of 

fresh, local foods.”

To 
ensure 
the 
market’s 

longstanding 
mission 
of 

providing shoppers with locally 
grown foods directly from the 
source, each seller’s farmland 
is routinely inspected.

“That’s a pretty particular 

thing for our market that’s not 
true of a lot of other farmers 
markets,” DeWitt said. “It’s 
something we’re particularly 
proud of.”

As a Davis, Calif. native, 

DeWitt frequented the city’s 
local farmers market, and 
has since remained a farmers 
market enthusiast. She still 
looks 
to 
her 
hometown 

marketplace for inspiration. 
For instance, a few years ago 
in the summertime, DeWitt 
introduced the predominantly 
Californian trend of food truck 
rallies on Wednesday evenings. 
The rallies offer an alternative 
to 
Ann 
Arbor’s 
brick-and-

mortar restaurant fare.

“We draw upon multiple 

sources for inspiration, but for 
me I think it always goes back 
to Davis because I think those 
things that stick with you as a 
kid are what you remember as 
adults,” DeWitt said.

As I sat on a bench just outside 

the market with DeWitt, her 
passion for the community was 
palpable as she stopped to greet 
each visitor whom she seemed 
to know on a personal level.

After our chat I strolled 

through the market, finding 
myself unexpectedly taken by 
rows of violet cabbage rosettes 
and the last of growers peak-
season apples. I was instantly 
convinced 
that 
the 
Ann 

Arbor Farmers Market is the 
only 
weekend 
event 
worth 

sacrificing a few hours of sleep.

“We try to cater 

to all product 
niches of fresh, 

local foods.”

TRAILER REVIEW

 Unlike the terrible trailer for 
“Insurgent,” the trailer for the 
latest installment in “The Diver-
gent Series” 
is, at least, 
colorful. As it 
begins, Tris 
(Shailene 
Woodley, 
“The Fault in 
Our Stars”), 
Four (Theo 
James, 
“Golden 
Boy”) and the 
rest of their 
team skirt 
a desolate, computer-animated 
countryside that resembles Mars. 
It contrasts strikingly with the 
antiseptic green of the ship where 
they are rescued. It’s possible to 
get wrapped up in the drive of the 
trailer, to fall for its quickly build-
ing intensity and even some hints 
of the story. One character men-
tions that the children of this new 
colony have grown up surveilling 
the main characters, a potentially 
intriguing idea. 

 
Then you tune in to the dialogue, 
including such gems as “People 
think walls separate us. But they 
also protect us,” “They’re trying 
to destroy us” and Jeff Daniels’s 
predictable assurance that Tris 
is “the only one” who can help 
rebuild society. To understand-
ably cynical viewers, the mon-
tage of images featuring flying 
spaceships, people running in 
panic and scenes of Tris and 
Four’s obligatory romance will 
feel completely by-the-numbers.
 “The Divergent Series: 
Allegiant” is a terrible idea for 
a movie to begin with — it’s 
based only on the first half of 
Veronica Roth’s YA book “Alle-
giant,” by far the most boring 
half-book in the series — but if 
it balances its shameless info-
dumps with thrilling action, it 
could manage to at least be a 
mindless, entertaining action 
movie. At worst, it’s another 
uninventive Y.A. adaptation 
that will be forgotten quickly.

Media careers 
explored at forum

Opportunites 

abound for 

entertainment 
business paths

By MARIAM SHEIKH

Daily Style Editor

Some people enter college 

knowing the exact path they 
want to follow. Some of these 
students — the cream of the crop 
— make it into the University’s 
School of Theatre, Music & 
Dance — it’s simply a stepping 
stone before they make it to the 
big leagues on Broadway. Others 
are those pacing the business-
oriented halls of Ross, destined 
for Wall Street.

But what about those of us who 

choose a less traditional path 
— those of us whose passions 
lie in somewhat of a gray area 
— hidden away in the overlap 
of arts and business? What 
about those of us interested in 
entertainment? This is where 
things start to get complicated.

It 
would 
seem 
that 
the 

University 
offers 
many 

opportunities for networking 
and career-oriented exploration 
to the likes of engineers and 
students in the Ross School 
of Business, but the case can 
even be made for LSA students 
looking 
to 
go 
down 
more 

common career paths.

But what about us artsy 

folk? The ones who geek out 
over 1970s jazz, or have an 
obsession with the character 
Ari Gold from “Entourage”? For 
students who want to enter the 
fields of entertainment, media 
or even the careers in their 
overlap, there are not many 
resources 
or 
opportunities 

on 
campus 
to 
network 
or 

explore. We acknowledge that 
the path is long, competitive 
and unconventional, but the 
opportunity to have a chance to 
explore should still be there for 
all students who want to avail it.

Each year, the Communication 

Studies Department hosts an 
Entertainment 
and 
Media 

Career forum, which I had 
the opportunity to attend on 
Nov. 13. Featuring six alumni 
from various sectors in the 
entertainment 
and 
media 

industries, all at different points 
in their careers, students had the 
opportunity to hear from each 
one of them in presentations and 
round-table discussions. 

While the event is primarily 

targeted toward upperclassman 
looking 
to 
network 
for 

internships and potential job 
opportunities, it was refreshing 
to speak with students from all 
ages and from various schools 
within the University, who were 
there to learn more about this 
specialized field.

When I told my parents I 

wanted to pursue a career in the 
business side of the arts world, 
specifically in entertainment, 
they simply laughed and wished 
me luck. This forum provided 
ample opportunity to listen, 
learn and question some of 
the best in the field, extremely 
helpful for those of us dealing 
with a particularly exclusive and 
seemingly mysterious industry.

This 
stigma 
surrounding 

this crucial sector of the arts 
almost deterred me from even 
considering it as a viable life 
choice at all — and that shouldn’t 
be the case for anyone. But, if I 
took away anything from the 
stories the panelists at the EMC 
forum shared, it’s that while this 
career choice is unconventional 
at best, with hard work the 

choice will be worth it.

As I see my friends and 

peers 
around 
me 
accepting 

high-paying offers to amazing 
companies left and right, it’s 
important to keep a level head 
and remember to not be afraid 
to start at the bottom, because 
everyone needs to pay their 
dues and start somewhere — 
especially in entertainment.

Particularly, University alum 

Ben Davis, who graduated in 2011 
majoring in Communications 
studies and is now a digital agent 
at William Morris Endeavor—
IMG, discussed his time at 
the prestigious talent agency 
from his humble start in the 
WME mailroom. In the digital 
world where mail may not be 
all that important, for WME 
employees having experience 
from the ground up is not only 
crucial, but also necessary, for 
employment. The mail room, 
while not as glamorous as 
people envision entertainment 
to be, gave Davis a clear path 
in, and the best way to learn 
about how everything works at 
WME, and in the entertainment 
industry in general.

The 
second 
story 
that 

resonated with me from the 
forum had a crucial moral, 
while easy in theory it proves 
difficult in practice. University 
alum Amy Fleischman, a 2012

graduate and a casting assistant 
at 
DreamWorks 
Animation, 

shared her journey to where 
she is now and stressed the 
importance of making the most 
of every and any opportunity 
that comes your way.

Starting as a page in NBC’s 

highly 
competitive 
page 

program, Fleischman stepped 
in when USA network’s then-
President of Production Jeff 
Kirschenbaum 
needed 
an 

assistant. While she may not 
have been ready for this jump 
from a page at that exact 
moment, she took the challenge. 
Because of her hard work and 
dedication, she networked and 
made the necessary connections 
to get her to where she is today 
at DreamWorks.

I think about all the times I 

have shied away from challenge 
because of this inherent fear of 

failure. Choosing a career post-
college is hard enough as it is, 
but it doesn’t get any easier when 
you choose a field that doesn’t 
have any guarantees. The arts 
is a grueling and unpredictable 
world, and the business side of it 
is no better.

University alum Peter Jaysen, 

class of 1989 and a film and 
television producer at Veritas 
Entertainment, feels like he 
is just now hitting his stride. 
After 20-plus years in the 
industry, his past experiences 
and hard work have begun to 
catch up with him and he now 
feels established and settled in 
the industry. At one point he 
described the entertainment 
world as a country club of 
sorts, and how he feels like he 
is finally a full-time member as 
opposed to just having a guest 
pass.

While the road is long and 

the path tricky, I couldn’t have 
been more excited and affirmed 
in my career choice just through 
seeing the passion each one of 
these accomplished graduates 
had about the work they were 
doing and all the work they had 
done to get there.

We have the privilege of 

attending a university with 
one of the largest communities 
of alumni in the world, who 
have gone on into diverse fields 
from 
journalism, 
politics, 

engineering, to entertainment. 
A forum such as this shouldn’t 
be the only thing available for 
students choosing to follow 
their artistic passions. However, 
it is one crucial step forward in 
giving all of us entertainment 
junkies a chance to learn — and 
to learn from the best alumni 
around.

It’s important 
to keep a level 
head and not to 

be afraid.

My parents 
laughed and 

wished me luck.

The arts is a 

grueling world.

Daily Film Editor

“You know, sometimes, I’d 

bring, like, four strippers to the 
radio show after work to party 
with us. So they were there for, 
like, five minutes, and I went 
outside to have a cigarette. When 
I came back in, the four girls were 
beelining out of there. ‘Oh my god, 
we’ve got to get out of there,’ they 
were saying, and, I’m like, ‘What, 
what?’ and there’s Bob, pants 
down, pubic hair on fire.”

 I can’t stop laughing. I’m 

Skyping with University alum 
Dee Simon, author and co-host 
of the “Sick and Wrong” podcast, 
and he’s telling me a story about 
his brief experience working as 
the host of a metal radio show in 
San Francisco.

 “Wait, his pubes were still on 

him?” I return. “He didn’t cut 
them off first?”

 “No, he was, like, lighting 

his dick on fire. Bob was a vile 
creature.” 

 Dee Simon is every Michigan 

parent’s worst nightmare. 

 Rather than file into line with 

the rest of the doctors, lawyers 
and engineers the University 
churns out every year, Simon 
(real name David Scott) decided 
that he wanted to do something 
different with his University of 
Michigan degree. He wanted to 
have his own radio show. 

 And, for a while, he did. After 

graduating from the University in 
1997 with a dual degree in English 
and Broadcast Communications 
(and a few Michigan Daily Arts 
articles under his belt), Dee 
moved out to the San Francisco 
Bay Area and hosted a late-
night program, Rampage Radio. 
Inspired by the lifestyle of shock-
jock radio DJs like Howard 
Stern, the heavy metal-focused 
show incorporated elements of 
dirty talk radio, complete with 
strippers and bizarre rocker 
guests doing drugs in the back of 
the studio. 

 However, Dee’s radio career 

didn’t pan out. There just wasn’t 
enough money in it to sustain a 
real career. For a while he spent 
time working first at a cushy tech 
job, then as a strip club DJ after 
the economy crashed in the early 
Bush era (he documented this 
journey in his autobiographical 
book, “Play Something Dancy”) 
but in more recent years he’s 
settled 
down 
into 
a 
more 

mundane, well-paying career in 

L.A. as a project manager for a 
kids’ software company. 

 “It’s weird. The place is owned 

by scientologists,” he said. 

 But Simon’s radio dream 

hasn’t died quite yet. 

 “I’ve always wanted to do 

radio. But it’s hard to get a 
broadcast radio gig, so podcasts 
are the next best thing,” he said. 

 For almost a decade, Simon 

has been the co-host of the “Sick 
and Wrong” podcast, the self-
described “world’s source for 
anti-social commentary.” “Sick 
and Wrong” features discussion 
of 
“the 
most 
disturbing 

news items of the week” and 
interviews with a huge variety of 
counterculture personalities. 

 Recent interviewees include 

Jinx Dawson, the lead singer of 
controversial ’60s-’70s satanic-
psychedelic band Coven, Mia 
Matsumiya, creator of the “perv_
magnet” Instagram page recently 
featured by Buzzfeed and Hung 
Yung Terrarist, a former sex 
cultist/current female MC. It’s 
easy to see how Dee’s origins as 
a shock-jock have influenced his 
work on “Sick and Wrong.”

 The podcast hit it big, but not 

huge. In the U.S., the show hovers 
around the bottom of the top 100 
comedy charts, while in the U.K., 
the show regularly has been seen 
in the top 10. The show’s fanbase is 
sizable, but insular.

 “It’s kinda cool to put out a 

product that has, you know, a niche 
audience,” he said. “It’s true, we’re 
not like Marc Maron or something. 
But you know, it’s fun!” 

 I’ve been listening to “Sick 

and Wrong” since I was, well, 
way too young to be listening to 
“Sick and Wrong.” I guess it was 
the subject matter that brought 
me to the show. Getting to learn 
about, drugs, counterculture and 
loose women at the age of 14 was 
something mundane small-town 
me couldn’t pass up. 

 Something I’ve always admired 

about the podcast is its ability to find 
humor in the darkest and strangest 
of places. It’s not disturbing for 
disturbing’s sake. Even when the 
stories the show covered got grisly 
or depressing, Dee and his former 
co-host (University alum Lance 
Wackerle, an electrical engineer) 
could always find ways to make me 
laugh about it. At its core, “Sick and 
Wrong” is a show about not taking 
life too seriously. 

 “Sick and Wrong” has over 500 

episodes available on the iTunes 
store. Producing one episode a 

week, that’s almost 10 years of 
podcasting 
experience 
under 

Simon’s belt. 

 
When 
Episode 
500 
was 

released a couple of months ago, 
it marked a huge change for the 
show: Wackerle, Dee’s co-host 
from day one, left the show. His 
new co-host, independent comic 
writer Andrew Harrison, has been 
picking up where Wackerle left off. 

 “It’s a weird situation when 

you have a long-running podcast 
and all of a sudden you need to 
switch hosts. So I was faced with a 
difficult decision,” he said. “What 
do I do? Do I start a new show? Do 
I finish my podcasting career? Or 
maybe like, try to find a different 
host? But then finding a different 
host poses its own problems, 
because they have to win the 
crowd over.”

 Dee met his new co-host 

Harrison through a mutual friend 
who met him on Tinder. 

 “They went on one date and she 

was like, wow, this guy is whacked. 
He started talking about doing 
heroin in Prague, and this whole 
thing about a dominatrix that 
pegged him, this weird shit. He’s a 
weird guy,” he said. 

 To top it off, the deep-voiced 

Harrison had years of New York 
radio experience under his belt. It 
was a match made in heaven. 

 “The cadence and the timing 

was there with him because he’d 
done radio. He wasn’t nervous, so 
that was kinda cool. His voice is 
great, and he has a great sense of 
humor, he’s a twisted individual.”

 Dee and Harrison are moving 

ahead with what they call “Sick 
and Wrong 2.0.,” a slight change 
in format to the show that still 
uses the same iTunes feed. A few 
drunken rants to Dee’s voicemail 
notwithstanding, 
the 
fanbase 

seems to have accepted Harrison 
with open arms. I can’t wait to see 
where the show goes from here.

 It was clear from just talking to 

him over Skype how much hosting 
talent Simon has. He told story 
after story and had me in tears. 
Maybe it’s a shame that Dee Simon 
didn’t make it big on the radio. Or 
maybe it isn’t, because in that case, 
my favorite podcast wouldn’t exist.

 If you’re looking for a comedy 

podcast out of the ordinary, you 
should listen to “Sick and Wrong” 
on iTunes. Dee’s autobiographical 
book about his experience as a strip 
club DJ, “Play Something Dancy,” 
is available on Amazon. Follow

SINGLE REVIEW

 Hip-hop fans have been 
downright spoiled this calendar 
year. Artists like Future and 
Young 
Thug have 
complete-
ly done 
away with 
traditional 
music dis-
tribution 
models, 
throwing 
out a staggering eight projects 
between them. While it could 
be argued that the shitstorm of 
free Atlanta mixtapes has in a 
way devalued contemporary rap 
music, Pusha T returned last 
week with a song that demands 
your attention for its entire 
duration.
 By this, I mean that upon 
its initial release you literally 
couldn’t play the song without 
holding and sustaining a “click” 
on the animated artwork on the 
label website; relax your trigger 
finger and the song starts over. 
It’s the details that make this 
single feel special, like the birds 
that fly around while the song 
plays (“flying a bird” translates 
to moving a brick of cocaine in 
Rapper Talk™). For those of you 
unfamiliar with Push and his 
long history with cocaine, it’s 
his raison d’etre. What weed is 

for Wiz Khalifa, money is for Jay 
Z, sex is for Lil Wayne, cocaine 
is for Push-A-Ton.
 While Push has been “the 
coke dealer in Balmain jeans” 
of rap for the last six years, he 
somehow never has to repeat 
himself. Every song in his rep-
ertoire is about freebase, but he 
consistently outdoes himself 
with the poetry he conjures; 
“Untouchable” is no exception. 
He uses “Cross-Fit” as a verb for 
lifting bricks of nose candy into 
his convertible.
 Given that he’s been dead 
silent since the fall of 2013 
(No, I haven’t forgotten that 
“Move That Dope” feature), it 
should surprise no one that he 

has a lot to say. What makes 
“Untouchable” one of the best 
hip-hop singles this year is 
the grandiosity with which 
he’s approached his return. 
There’s the obligatory flex of 
his new position at the helm 
of G.O.O.D. Music, and like 
any street hustler, he of course 
had to disclose his exact sal-
ary. In less than four minutes 
he manages to throw serious 
shade at Donald Trump, com-
pare himself to Pablo Escobar 
and evoke the mental image 
of a Rolls Royce with a trunk 
full of blow. Ah, he’s well and 
truly back.

T

his year, I decided to 
switch up the focus 
of my food column, 

from opinion pieces and the 
occasional restaurant review, 
to report-
age on local 
restaurants. 
Ann Arbor is 
home to an 
increasing 
number of 
restaurants, 
many of 
them off-
campus and 
overlooked, 
run by peo-
ple preparing versions of their 
home country’s food. I’d like, if 
possible, to expose my readers 
to as many of them as possible, 
and document the extraordi-
nary journeys and work that 
have gone into building these 
restaurants.

When a professor of mine, 

who had lived in Israel, told 
me to check out Haifa Falafel, 
I headed over immediately. 
Twenty 
bus 
stops 
down 

Washtenaw Avenue, I found 
the tiny shop. Painted on the 
storefront windows were the 
phrases “MEDITERRANEAN 
FOOD” and “HAIFA STYLE 
FALAFEL.” I had called the 
owner, Ali Usman, beforehand 
to schedule the interview, but 
when I arrived he was still 
hustling in the kitchen. I took 
a seat and took my standard 
atmosphere notes: jangly music 
playing, 
colorful 
lanterns 

hanging, 
smell 
of 
sumac 

wafting. Pasted on the walls 
were photos of Haifa, Israel, 

including its famous Bahá’í 
temple (Baha’i is a religion, of 
Persian origin, that emphasizes 
the 
spiritual 
unity 
of 

humankind). Usman prepared 
us two chicken shawarmas and 
a plate of crisp, mahogany-
colored falafel, and we sat down 
to eat. I ignored the food at first 
— I wanted to know everything 
about this restaurant, and him.

“Where are you from?”
“How did this place start?
“Are you Baha’i?”
Tall, lean and intense, Usman 

seemed a bit puzzled. He gave 
me the basics: He’s an Israeli-
Arab from outside Haifa, who, 
as an 18-year-old, followed his 
two brothers to Ann Arbor to 
open this shop, even though 
none of them had any formal 
training. His two brothers have 
since married and left, leaving 
him in charge. He’s not Baha’i. 
But that’s as much as he’d say 
about himself.

“Talk about the food,” he 

urged me. “Don’t talk about 
me, or all of … this,” gesturing 
towards the lanterns and the 
photos and the speakers. 

At this point, a customer 

sitting nearby pulled up a chair 
to offer his input.

“This is the best food in 

Ann Arbor,” he said. “The best 
falafel I’ve ever had. I come 
here two or three times a week. 
Make sure you take that down.” 
 

After eating there myself, 

I can see why. The terms 
“Mediterranean” and “Middle 
Eastern” are too vague. Take 
the falafel. Each city in Israel 
has its own variety: Jerusalem 
falafel are big, dense and 
green from copious amounts of 
chopped parsley. In Tel Aviv, 
they’re rolled smaller, but are 
still green. Haifa-style falafel 
are gumball-sized, golden and 
have a looser texture.

The ones Usman prepares are 

some of the best I’ve ever had — 
crispy-creamy, garlicky, great 
even outside of a sandwich. He 
takes great pride in preparing 
them, which also means that 
he can’t always get them to that 

perfect color.

“I make them myself, it’s a 

whole process,” he said. “I can’t 
get it right every time.”

Another 
non-downtown 

specialty of his is majadara: 
lentils cooked with toothsome, 
nutty bulgur wheat. But there 
are some things that Usman 
can’t translate from Haifa to 
Ann Arbor. In Haifa, falafel are 
typically stuffed into a half-circle 
of pita that’s squeezed open.

“We still can’t find a good 

enough pita to do that,” he said, 
in between mouthfuls. “One 
time, we had a grocery store 
try to bake it, and they sent us 
triangular pitas. Now, we just 
use flat ones and wrap it.”

Any attempt to bring hyper-

regional food to Michigan is 
bound to run into problems 
like that. More surprising is 
Usman’s customer base. Israeli-
Arabs and Palestinians make up 
just one part of the local Arab 
community, many of whom are 
from Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. 
But Usman told me that Arabs 
actually are a minority of his 
business — Jews and vegetarians 
flock there in huge numbers. 

Either 
way, 
Usman 
has 

a fierce pride in what he’s 
doing — feeding people, and 
exposing them to food that he 
doesn’t think they’ll be getting 
downtown. As I walked out the 
door, his farewell line said it all.

“One more thing: Jerusalem 

Garden has got nothing on us.”

EPISODE REVIEW

 The more we find out, the 
less we know. ABC’s new hit 
drama “Quantico” has pulled 
out all the 
stops in its 
first season 
— and the 
latest epi-
sode, “Over,” 
was no 
exception. 
The secrets 
keep piling 
on, and the 
godly FBI agents keep up their 
badassery.
 In real time, FBI agent Alex 
Parrish (Bollywood actress 
Priyanka Chopra) continues to 
hunt for the terrorist who set 
her up for the Grand Central 
Station bombing. Lucky for 
her, the FBI got hacked, leak-
ing classified documents with 
all the information she needs 
to clear her name. Then comes 
a big twist: There’s another 
bomb somewhere in the city, 
and nobody knows where to 

look. Flashback to the Quan-
tico training facility, and the 
NATs are given yet another 
test. Nimah and Raina finally 
reveal their separate entities, 
but Simon seems to have acci-
dentally fallen for the “wrong” 
twin. Shelby and Caleb con-
tinue to develop their romance, 
building suspense for the 
reason that will explain their 
doomed relationship.

 The double-time structure of 
the show allows for a fast-paced 
drama, keeping the audience 
on its toes and eager to connect 
the dots. The agents have a con-
tagious chemistry and complex 
background stories, which pro-
vides the dramatic backbone for 
this supposed “guilty pleasure” 
series.
