On campus emergency
calls decrease while
off campus sees
higher enforcement
By MAX RADWIN
Daily StaffReporter
Like many freshmen during
the 2014 Welcome Week, the
,first home game against Appa-

lachian State University was
not only University President
Mark Schlissel's first exposure
to Michigan football, but also to
the University's culture of alco-
hol consumption on campus. And
after seeingstudents drinking on
rooftops and struggling to stand
up, Schlissel said he was terrified.
Though Schlissel called
increasing alcohol safety a long-
term project, the University has
already taken steps to limit the
kind of unsafe alcohol activity he

witnessed first-hand that takes
place during Welcome Week,
which is known for promoting an
excessively unsafe drinking envi-
ronment.
However, the University's
efforts to quell drinking this year
had mixed results.
According to data compiled by
the University's Division of Pub-
lic Safety and Security, this year's
Welcome Week saw a general
decline in on-campus alcohol-
related activity, but an uptick

in off-campus neighborhoods.
The discrepancy may not reflect
a shift in drinking culture, but
rather increased enforcement of
underage drinking violations by
the University police compound-
ed with a shorter move-in period
for on-campus residents.

meeting, SACUA Chair Scott
Masten, a professor of business

DailyStaffReporter
Students from the Ross
School of Business, StartUM
Entrepreneurship and TAMID
Israel Investment Group at Mich-
igan continued their missions to
encourage innovation on a global
scale, all while learning about
tech startups Tuesday.
Aaron Fuchs, founder and CEO
of the South African technology
startup iXperience, discussed his
experiences starting a technology
firmwith about40 students atthe
Business school.
"The whole concept around
iXperience is to help people get
the skills that they need to suc-
ceed in the digital world," Fuchs
said.
The event was also intended to
promote the company's summer
internship program. iXperinece
hosts an eight-week summer
internship program in Cape
Town, South Africa. During the

first four weeks, students focus
on coding hefore working on
technology projects with existing
South African companies.
Fuchs said the program was
created to meet the increasing
demand for technological infor-
mation in emerging markets,
where there are fewer opportuni-
ties for a technical education.
Fuchs, who grew up in south-
ern South Africa and said he
didn't come in contact with tech-
nology until he was 10 years old,
asked students to think about
their goals, assess their inspira-
tions and determine their life's
purpose.
"What do you love doing?" he
said. "What does the world need
to be abetter place? What can you
be paid for and what are you good
at? And where all these things
intersect, is where your find your
purpose exists and you can actu-
ally add so much more value to
whatever it is that you are doing."
He also encouraged students to
interact with people who inspire
and motivate them, aswell as find
mentorswho can share their own
experiences.

Native American Outreach

A report released Monday by
Northwestern's Native Ameri-
can Outreach and Inclusion Task
Force outlined a series of recom-
mendations for Northwestern
University, the Daily Northwest-
ern reported.
The report offers more than
50 ways that the University can
improve their relationship with
Native American communities
on campus, including creating an
Indigenous Research Center and
renaming programs and build-
ings after University founder John
Evans. It also calls for hiring a
staff member within Multicul-
tural Student Affairs to support
Native American students.
Northwestern Psychology Prof.
Doug Medin, who served on the

task force, was confident in the
ways that the report will help
increase Native American inclu-
sion on campus.
"The recommendations are
both concrete and quite exten-
sive," he said. "I think that indi-
cates the seriousness with which
Northwestern is beginning to
address its relationship with
Native nations and Native Ameri-
can people."

Following violence
and five deaths,
tensions run high
amid conflict
JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel
vowed harsh retaliation Tues-
day for a Palestinian attack
that killed five people and left
blood-smeared prayer books
and shawls on the floor of a
synagogue in Jerusalem - an
assault that sharply escalated
already-high tensions after
weeks of religious violence.
The attack during morning
prayers in the west Jerusalem
neighborhood of Har Nof was
carried out by two Palestin-
ian cousins wielding meat
cleavers, knives and a hand-
gun. They were shot to death
by police after the deadliest
assault in the holy city since
2008.
Four of the dead were rab-
bis and one was a police offi-
cer who died of his wounds
hours after the attack. Three
of the rabbis were born in
the United States and the
fourth was born in England,
although all held dual Israeli
citizenship. Five others were
wounded.
Palestinian President Mah-
moud Abbas condemned the
attack, the first time he has
done so in the wave of deadly
violence against Israelis. But
he also called for an end to
Israeli "provocations" sur-

rounding Jerusalem's shrines
that are sacred to both Mus-
lims and Jews.
President Barack Obama
called the attack "horrific"
and without justification,
urging cooperation from both
sides to ease tensions and
adding that too many Israelis
and Palestinians have died in
recent months,
Tuesday's attack, however,
appeared to mark a turn-
ing point, with the gruesome
scene in a house of worship
shocking a nation long accus-
tomed to violence.
The government released a
photo of a meat cleaver it said
came from the crime scene.
Government video showed
blood-soaked prayer books
and prayer shawls in the
synagogue. A pair of glasses
lay under a table, and thick
streaks of blood smeared the
floor.
"I saw people lying on the
floor, blood everywhere,"
said Yosef Posternak, who
was at the synagogue in the
quiet neighborhood that has a
large community of English-
speaking immigrants.
"People were trying to
fight with (the attackers) but
they didn't have much of a
chance," Posternak told Isra-
el Radio.
In one of Israel's first acts
of retaliation, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu ordered
the demolitions of the homes
of the attackers. But halting
further violence could prove

to be a tough challenge as
police confront a new threat:
Lightly armed assailants
from annexed east Jerusalem
who hold residency rights
that allow them to move free-
ly throughout the country.
Netanyahu condemned the
deaths of the "innocent and
pure Jews." In a nationally
televised address, he accused
Abbas of inciting the recent
violence and said the Pales-
tinian leader's condemnation
of the attack was insufficient.
Hamas, the militant Pal-
estinian group that runs the
Gaza Strip, praised the attack.
In Gaza, dozens celebrated in
the streets, with some offer-
ing trays full of candy.
The U.S.-born victims were
identified as Moshe Twer-
sky, 59, Aryeh Kupinsky, 43,
and Kalman Levine, 55. The
Israeli Foreign Ministry said
the British man was Avraham
Goldberg, 68, who immigrat-
ed to Israel in 1993.
It described the four as
"rabbis," an honorific title
in the ultra-Orthodox world
given to men who are consid-
ered pious and learned. Twer-
sky, a native of Boston, was
the head of the Toras Moshe
Yeshiva, a seminary for Eng-
lish-speaking students. He
was the son of Rabbi Isador
Twersky, founder of Harvard
University's Center for Jew-
ish Studies, and a grandson
Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik,
a luminary in the world of
modern Orthodox Jewry.

Debra Tate, whose pregnant
sister Sharon was slain in 1969

Her job got tougher with the

fessors who win the award are
also asked to give a "last lecture"
usually held at Rackham Audi-
torium. Past recipients of the
award include History Prof. Vic-
tor Lieberman and Psychology
Lecturer Shelly Schreier.
The proposal asked for $300
from the CSG sponsored activi-
ties account to be used to fund
the Golden Apple Award and
the lecture, which will be held
March 31.
"It seems to be something that
is pretty fitting with what we
(CSG) do," Dishell said.
The resolution was referred to
the finance committee and will
be voted on during the next CSG
meeting.
Dishell also spoke about the
progress of the Wolverine Sup-

port Network, a University-wide
peer mental health program,
which launched its awareness
campaign in September.
Last weekend, there was a
retreat for WSN leaders where
they were trained in differ-
ent facilitation techniques and
received training from Sexual
Assault Prevention and Aware-
ness Center, Diversity Peer
Educators and Counseling and
Psychological Services.
Lastly, Dishell also discussed
his meeting with interim Ath-
letic Director Jim Hackett.
Dishell said initiatives passed
in collaboration with former
Athletic Director Dave Brandon
will carry over during Hackett's
term, including lowering student
season ticket package prices to
$175.
"He seems to be very recep-
tive," Dishell said.
As the Athletic Department
experiences a shift in leadership,
so will CSG.
LSA, the Ross School of Busi-
ness, School of Information,
School of Public Health, the Law

Additionally, the students will

WELCOMEWEEK
From Page 1A
echoed Schlissel's sentiments
regarding the experience many
students have during Welcome
Week.
"We want to make sure (new
students') first impressions are
not football and alcohol," he said.
"It's something more academic -
a more positive side of the Univer-
sity."
Masten's sentiment is reflected
in a variety of alcohol-related sta-
tistics compiled in a DPSS report
regarding Welcome Week: the
number of ambulance requests
to University Housing facili-
ties dropped from 46 in 2013
to 31. Calls to the DPSS Com-
munications Center related to
drinking, noise complaints, uri-
nating in public and incapaci-
tation declined from 106 to 85.
Visits to University Emergency
Departments, which the report
deemed "the leading indicator"
of alcohol activity, dropped from
100 to 76.
The report, dated Sept. 4 and
titled "Student Move-in Alcohol
Activities," presents "prelimi-
nary" and "advisory" figures only.
It was written for informational
purposes for University officials
and was not originally intended
for public release. A spokesper-
son for the Ann Arbor Police said
they were unaware of how the
information regarding Ann Arbor
Police activity was compiled.
The data encompasses all alco-
hol-related incidents between
Aug. 25 and Sept. 2 of this year
in comparison to Aug. 26 and
Sept. 3 of 2013 - each spanning
nine days. However, the move-
in period for University housing
residents was shortened this year
from four days to two, and so the

decline in alcohol activity is may
partly be a result of students not
being on campus to drink.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald confirmed the short-
ened Welcome Week was partly
intended to cut down on the
amount of unstructured time stu-
dents had in dorms that was often
filled by alcohol consumption.
While he said this year's Wel-
come Week went well, Fitzgerald
added that the University hasn't
yet decided on the Welcome Week
timeline for next year.
E. Royster Harper, vice presi-
dent of student life, said the
University is also going to be
rethinking its law enforcement
strategies.
"There are just going to be
more consequences for walking
around with open containers,
with loud music and everybody
on the lawn obviously drinking,"
she said.
The number of citations for a
minor in possession by Univer-
sity Police during welcome week
increased from 27 to 40 between
this year and last, despite the
shortened move-in period.
According to the DPSS report,
this was the result of a "grant-
funded patrol (unit) targeting the
enforcement of underage drink-
ingviolations," performed by Uni-
versity Police and the Washtenaw
County Sheriff's Office.
Throughout the year, Washt-
enaw County receives fund-
ing from the state for targeted
enforcement, which has previ-
ously included directed patrols
toward the Click It or Ticket cam-
paign and drunk-driving enforce-
ment efforts.
A DPSS spokesperson said
grants are often deployed dur-
ing times of higher risk behavior,
such as holidays or in this case,
Welcome Week. The report's
numbers include one night of

a two-night grant coordinated
through the Washtenaw County
Sheriff's Department that pro-
vided additional officers to patrol
nearby campus streets. Extra offi-
cers were not deployed in 2013.
The DPSS spokesperson said
University police officers do not
have quotas for giving out MIPs.
"Their primary focus is to
ensure our community members
are safe and then enforce laws as
deemed appropriate."
In light of the decline of on-
campus alcohol activity, emer-
gency calls to the Ann Arbor
police from neighborhoods with
student rental housing or proper-
ties adjacent to campus increased
by 48 percent - from 241 calls to
358 - according to the Univer-
sity's report. In addition, calls
for assistance for an incapaci-
tated person to Ann Arbor Police
approximately doubled.
The spokesperson said the Ann
Arbor Police have not received a
grant for increased enforcement
in the last two years at least, but
they did have extra patrol during
this Welcome Week.
"We work with Ann Arbor
Police and the Washtenaw Coun-
ty Police and we are all equally
concerned with the alcohol issues
on campus," an Ann Arbor Police
spokesperson said. "We want stu-
dents to be safe. We are aware
that people drink, but we want
them to do it responsibly."
Similarly, Schlissel said the
University will continue to
emphasize safety as it develops
strategies for combatting alco-
hol.
"I think it's impractical to
have as a goal that students won't
drink on campus," Schlissel said.
"Even though most of students
are drinking illegally, I don't
think that's an enforceable law,
but looking at it from the safety
perspective is what I want to do."


GHANA
From Page 1A
According to University
alum Carolyn Yarina, chief
executive officer of Sisu Glob-
al Health, 80 percent of the
world's medical technology is
designed for 10 percent of the
world's population, leaving 90
percent without access to ade-
quate medical equipment.
"Over the past couple of
years, the amount of times
we've heard doctors say, essen-
tially, if they just had simple
technology - a microscope
here, or access to blood, or an
ultrasound, or a lot of simple
things- they could save lives,"
Yarina said. "But they don't
have access to a lot of these
technologies."
Sisu Global Health is work-
ing to prepare the Ghanaian
market for its new product,
the Hemafuse - a device that
retransfuses a patient's blood.
While in Ghana, the Sisu
Global Health team members
observed that blood transfu-
sions in the area were hindered
by high costs and inadequate
infrastructure. Transfusions
are most needed in cases
involving complicated preg-
nancies or traffic accidents
resulting in severe blood loss.
The cost for testing and then
processing one pint of blood
is about $50 in Ghana, Yarina
said.
The price for patients usual-
ly falls between $50 and $150
for one to three pints of donor
blood. If patients are unable
to pay for donor blood, doc-
tors can attempt to collect the
lost blood and return it to that
same person's body. According
to Yarina, some do so using a
soup ladle and gauze.
However, the Hemafuse
technology provides a safer,
more efficient and sanitary
blood collection method.
The device then returns the
blood directly to the patient.
According to Sisu Global
Health's~ website, Hemafuse
requires one-third of the time
it takes a soup ladle to do the
same job, and one-ninth the
staff.
Hospitals would purchase
a device while patients would
only need to purchase a $101fil-
ter piece.
Sisu Global Health began
last spring when two Uni-
versity-based companies,
CentriCycle and Design Inno-
vations for Infants and Moth-
ers Everywhere,. Inc., joined
forces.
Yarina was the founder
of CentriCycle, while Uni-
versity alum Gillian Henker,
chief technology officer of
Sisu Global Health, founded
DIIME.
"We were in the same social
venture practicum," Yarina
said. "We had the same over-
arching vision, but initially we
had different paths we want-
ed to take to get to that same
point."
Different as they may have
been at first, both paths lead to
the health care facet of social
entrepreneurship.

The field of social entre-
preneurship recognizes criti-
cal gaps in social issues and
systems, said University
alum Grace Hsia, CEO and
co-founder of Warmilu, a for-
profit company that provides
heating technologies for ther-
apy and at-risk infants.
"The solution that the social
entrepreneur is trying to pres-
ent helps to change systems,
not just address symptoms of a
problem," Hsia said.
Hsia met Yarina and Genker
in TechArb, a program encour-
aging University students to
explore their ideas through
applied entrepreneurial edu-
cation and experience.
For Yarina, her path began
before TechArb in her fresh-
man year Engineering 100
class, taught by Dr. Susan
Montgomery, the Chemical
Engineering Undergraduate
Program adviser.
In this class, Yarina and her
group members worked on an
earlier version of Sisu Global
Health's (r)Evolve, a blood-
separating centrifuge that
allows for easier diagnosis
with a rapid diagnostic test.
Though not currently on the
market, (r)Evolve technology
could more effectively diag-
nose cases of HIV, malaria,
hepatitis, syphilis and typhoid
fever.

Montgomery recalled Yari-
na and her Engineering 100
group using a bicycle tire to
make a centrifuge. They used
the spoke of the bicycle as a
test tube holder and were able
to move the pedal and turn
the wheel to get "centrifugal
action," Montgomery said.
"I've seen many people
start projects and think about
taking it to the next level,
but none of the groups have
done it to the extent that this
team has," Montgomery said.
"They could have been done
and moved to other things but
that they would hold onto it
and grow it to this extent, and
with the leadership that Car-
olyn has had in making this
possible, it's energizing."
Four years down the road,
in 2013, Albion College alum
Katie Kirsch, chief marketing
officer of Sisu Global Health,
joined Yarina's CentriCycle
team. She joined shortly after
returning home from Rwanda
where she had a Fulbright
English Teaching Assistant-
ship at the National Univer-
sity of Rwanda.
It was her experience
in Rwanda that influenced
Kirsch to join the cause of her
current partners Yarina and
Genker.
"I had a lot of students
who were unable to come to
class because either they had
health .complications them-
selves or their family mem-
bers did," Kirsch said. "I felt
like I couldn't influence my
student's lives in the way that
I wanted to."
Kirsch said the inefficiency
and inaccessibility of the hos-
pitals prevented many Rwan-
dans from receiving proper
care, which hospitals should
be able to administer with
ease.
Determined to solve that
problem, Kirsch, Yarina, and
Genker joined forces a year
later through Sisu Global
Health.
The group decided to build
their company around what
they call "human-centered
design."
Their first step was to
observe, Yarina said. Instead
of searching for an adequate
market for an existing product,
the trio studied the medical
system in Ghana, pinpointed
the issues and designed their
product accordingly.
Throughout the project,
they have spoken to doctors,
administrators, maintenance
staff and patients to gauge the
needs of the area.
"We're partnering direct-
ly with these doctors who
wouldn't usually have their
opinion asked of them, which
is silly," Kirsch said.
Yarina noted that the com-
pany has a "double bottom
line" - success to them means
not only financial gain, but
also the impact they cause.
Financially, the group
decided that the best way to
make an impact was through
DIIME's for-profit route rath-
er than CentriCycle's non-
profit one.

"If you give something
away, you can probably only
access maybe a village, or a
couple hundred people," Yari-
na said. "But if you actually
sell something in scale, there's
the potential to impact the
whole world."
Currently, Sisu is in the
testing phase of their Hema-
fuse product and hopes to
run clinical trials on patients
within the next year.
They've built relationships
with Ghanaian hospitals, cre-
ated a subsidiary legal busi-
ness entity in Ghana and
hope to hire someone on the
ground in Ghana soon.
While Sisu Global Health
aims to implement the Hema-
fuse product in Ghana, they
also hope to commercially
manufacture (r)Evolve in the
future and extend their prod-
ucts to India, which was Cen-
triCycle's original market.
Hsia said Sisu Global
Health is in a unique situation
due to the "diverse skillsets"
brought together in the union
of the CentriCycle and DIIME
teams.
"By putting these two
g sups together and all of
their collective knowledge
and customer base, I think
they're goi'g to do great
things," Hs' said. "I'm really
excited and proud of them."

Stefanie Wuschitz (left), founder of a feminist hackerspace in Vienna, and Lisa Nakamura (right), coordinator of Digital
Studies, discuss their work at the Women in Technology panel hosted by the School of Information at North Quad Monday.

WOMEN
From Page 1A
"Usually such hackerspaces are
wonderful environments, but
they are really male dominated
so at some point we felt just very
uncozy there."
While Wuschitz said she
appreciates the growing inclu-
sion of women in technology, she
said pink or purple hardware pro-
duced over the past year perpetu-
ates gendered stereotypes. She
noted that when she would teach
workshops on microcontroller
programming with pink and blue
controllers, people would often
assume that the pink controller
was easier, though it was actually
the harder of the two.
The first feminist hackerspace
Wuschitz was involved in was
created out of these experiences.
All the women involved split the
rent, tempering the level of hier-
archy that bothered women in the
original hackerspace.
Though most of the males have

welcomed the all-female hacker-
space, Wuschitz said she received
the most criticism for the space's
use of the feminized versions of
technical terms.
In the German language, words
are associated with a gender and
all of the words dealing with tech-
nology are in the masculine form.
In protest, the technological fem-
inists created female versions of
these words. Despite some criti-
cism, many men, specifically in
Wuschitz's classes, have adopted
the terms.
Nakamura, on the other hand,
became involved in the rela-
tionship between feminism and
technology during the Internet's
earlier days. She said since people
online were not aware of her gen-
der, they often assumed she was
male. Later, she helped to create
FemTechNet, which offers free
online classes on feminism and
technology.
"There's really robust evi-
dence that women in technol-
ogy succeed because they have a
mentor who is also one," she said.
"It's hard to find female mentors

in technology."
Both panelists stressed the
necessity of having feminist
technology resources available
for free and the importance of
promoting a culture that values
sharing knowledge and skills,
as well as increasing diversity in
the field.
"The more diverse it is, the
easier it is for others to identify
with them," Wuschitz said.
Wuschitz said many women
canceled their workshops
because they did not have the
confidence to teach them. She
said increased inclusion of
women in technology fields will
help to resolve this issue.
"As a woman in technol-
ogy, I was interested in hear-
ing perspectives from people
who are working in the fields,"
said Denise Foley, a second-
year graduate student School
of Information, who attended
the panel. "I am newly working
in the field of technology in the
library so I wanted to learn more
about what's going on in the field
of female technologists."


STARTUP
From Page 1A
in a startup are coding skills and
the ability to market a product,
create user-friendly designs and
develop the business.
"I accomplished X, measured
by Y, by doing Z. You should go
through every single line on your
resume and apply this formula
and see if you can actually see the
results," he said.
Fuchs also warned students
about the challenges of launching
a technology startup, saying they
should prepare to work harder
than ever before, face difficulties
executing their idea, make deci-
sions of great importance to the

future of the company and multi-
task jobs that aren't necessarily in
their job description.
Fuchs also talked about his
own experience at a Wall Street
firm after graduating from Yale
University. While he said he
gained a lot of valuable experi-
ence, after two years he decided
he needed to do something new,
which lead him to joining Prodi-
gy Finance, a company that gives
loans to international postgradu-
ate business school students in
Cape Town. There, Fuchs learn-
ing computer coding, a skill he
said is valuable to everyone.
"Once I had done that, it was
one of the most empowering
things I actually had done in my
life, because now I had the power
to build things that could be dis-

tributed around the world in a
matter of seconds," he said.
LSA freshman Rebecca Lee-
man said she attended the event
because she is interested in going
to South Africa and noted friends
who study computer science have
showed her coding is a valuable
skill.
"I learned about the summer
program but I also learned life
skills that I wasn't expecting to
learn," she said.
Fuchs said he hopes iXperience
will expand tol10 cities around the
world, with 150 students in each
summer program within three
years. They company is also con-
sidering adding new courses, such
as consulting, and building a ven-
ture capital fund finance the ideas
of student interns.

Institutional trauma

nstead this article is about the voices
that have been silenced, because
football has taken the forefront of
concerns. Even though
this institution will first
listen to #firedavebrandon
before #expelrapists, I
will not. Even though{
the Board of Regents and
University President sit in
their cushioned lives so far
removed from reality, I will
not. Even though football
wins are the dearest things TOSIC
to privileged white boys',TOSI
hearts, I will not write to
please them more. I will not
create yet another space through which they
can dominate.
Now thatI have turned away the very white
men that will not be the subject of my article.
Now that they have turned the page and
closed the Internet tab. Now that they have
stopped listening because this article doesn't
glorify them, let's talk for real.
The reality is that so many of us are in pain.
The silencing of our pain adds even more pain.
It is assumed that we have an entered a col-
lege utopia where race, class, gender, sexual
orientation and other identities don't matter
because everyone is simply human. But we are
not all just human. We live in a realm where
our identities shape our existence. They may
warrant oppression, but they so also give
color to our lives. They teach how us to love
and bring us closer to one another. So don't
wash away our nuances by labeling us all as
just human - a classless homogeneity. Doing
so denies the many different ways people have
connection to humanity.
The reality is that the pain that class causes
is not discussed. We swim in the notion that
the American Dream is real. We enter our uni-
versity community believing it is an isolated
bubble, and within it we lbc me classless.
There's a belief stirring amongst us that as
University students, we all have joined a melt-
ing pot where class differences do not exist -
that being a University student is its own class
category.

The reality is that there is a belief that class
is invisible. A belief that class cannot be iden-
tified because it doesn't mark us. But who is
it actually invisible to? Working-class identity
scars working hands. It creates wrinkles of
worry. It causes rumbling stomachs. On the
other end, class privilege creates smoothness,
ease, comfort and fullness. Class is invisible
only to those who have never had to look into
their own reflection and see working-class
bruises.
The reality is that some are consumed with
worries while others will never have to expe-
rience them. A worry of how to pay tuition
each semester. A worry of which to pick -
paying rent or buying food. A worry of how
to stay warm as winter worsens. A worry of
how to stay on top of homework after working
each day. A worry that being cash-poor will
translate into laziness. A worry that "work-
ing class" will be soon be connected to lack-
ing wealth of knowledge. A worry of having
worry show in one's eyes.
The reality is that this is not my reality. I
do not have to worry about how to pay rent or
tuition. I can pay each in full the day it is due.
I do not work jobs alongside school to ensure
that I can survive. As my mother says, I work
part-time to save money for something nice.
I do not worry what others will think when
they correctly read my class identity. I do
not worry.
The reality is that one can become aware of
reality. Even though I do not have to worry,
I bear the responsibility to discontinue the
silencing of working-class individuals. The
first step is for privileged folks to examine
their own lives and the comfort they can
afford. One does not have to seek painful
narratives from others in order to understand
class divisions. Each class category shapes
individuals, so start by learning how you are
shaped by your own identity. Let your heart
expand with understanding and compassion.
Then move through this world with a
awareness and a ploy to listen instead of
perpetuating silence.

Trigger warning: sexual
assault, mental health turmoil and
institutional betrayal.
Names have been changed to respect
the privacy and bravery of those who
spoke with me.
It takes an incredible amount of
strength to ask for help. It takes even
more strength to do so if you have
been defiled, disrespected or violated.
Survivors on this campus are pushed
to come out of the woodwork, only
to find themselves naked in front of a
spotlight, facing an indifferent audi-
ence and achorus of"I'm so sorry."
Amid the It's On Us policy advis-
ing roundtables, a potent display of
students demands on the Diag and
the Sexual Assault Prevention and
Awareness Center Survivor Speak
Out, I have to ask: what do we talk
about when we talk about reform
surrounding sexual assault? We talk
about accountability. We talk about
prevention and bystander awareness.
We talk about survivor support ser-
vices, in which survivors can find a
healing community, such as SAPAC.
We talk about statistics and studies.
We talk about the narratives of those
who spoke up, such as Emma Sulko-
wicz of Columbia University, heroine
of the Carry That Weight campaign.
And all of this is vital, pulsing and
critical to the daily life of the one
in four.
Yet I want to say, no, shout, that
we are missing something. We are
missing the conversations that take
place in quiet. Let's talk about the
individual mental struggle. Let's talk
about trauma.
When I expressed my anxiety
toward the end of last year, the most
common response I heard was: "Why
don't you try CAPS?" Counseling and
Psychological Services is free (once
you've paid the University's crippling
annual tuition) and accessible in the
Michigan Union.As manyofmy peers
know,the first thing one does at CAPS
is sit in front of a screen and take an

intake survey. I supplied information
about my relationship with my moth-
er and my father, my sisters, my sexual
history, my sleeping habits, my aca-
demic stress level. I provided an hon-
est account of being raped. I clicked a
small box, to indicate that I needed to
be seen, that I needed to be heard.
When I approached the desk to
make an appointment, a woman
looked up at me and said that the
next opening was in more than three
weeks. Three weeks. I spilled my guts
to a boxy computer screen. I asked for
help. Threeweeks.
I am not at all alone in this expe-
rience. The rehashing of trauma
only to be neglected in the lobby of
CAPS is, unfortunately, a seemingly
common experience.
Alexa, an LSA sophomore, told me
her story.
"When I was first seen, my initial
visit lasted about two minutes ... I
walked into awoman'soffice and after
askingme myname,the firstthingthe
woman said was something along the
lines oft'I read your form butI would
like for you to tell me in your own
words and in detail why you are here.'
This struck me because if she read my
form and knew I was there because I
had been raped, I didn't understand
why she needed me to tell her that
again." Alexa then had to describe her
trauma, which was clearly notated: "It
was very triggeringto write and then
even worse to weepily explain what
happened tome to astranger whowas
not even going to be the person work-
ing with me."
The counselor concluded after
two minutes that Alexa needed to see
a trauma counselor, to make a new
appointment and to wait another
three weeks.
To make matters worse, the coun-
selor shifted the fear and blame far-
ther ontoAlexa:"She also said,'People
like you tend to develop some para-
noia after their trauma such as con-
stantly looking behind you when you

walk and being afraid of being alone,
especially at night.' ... she made me
aware that maybe I should be scared
and now I find myself uncomfortable
when people are walking close behind
me and whenI am alone at night."
Jane, a senior, had to wait two
weeks, only to be given a list of private
therapists. Sarah, asophomoresuffer-
ing from anxiety, had to wait three.
I would like to be clear: I am glad
CAPS exists - but it is not enough.
Sexual assault doesn't end with a
rape kit, a court date or an assailant's
one-yearsuspension fromtheUniver-
sity. It doesn't end when you're in a
loving relationship, when you're safe
and looked after. It lives in people,
travels with them and becomes a part
of their human experience. By list-
ing CAPS as an institution prepared
to deal with the psychological pain
that comes from such experience, the
University is disrespecting the very
women it claims to foster. By refusing
to allocate adequate resources to the
mental health of its students, while
the furnishings of East Quad alone
cost $3.3 million dollars, the Uni-
versity states its priorities through
its actions.
CAPS announced a changeinpolicy
at the beginning of the semester, stat-
ing that wait times for an initial visit
will be one to three days. Yet Alexa's
and Sarah's waits both occurred with-
in this semester. If this policy does
indeed get enacted properly, when we
arrive, will we be treated like Alexa
was, with a cold, efficient demeanor,
or like damaged goods, which the
University must sulkingly deal with?
or rather, surprisingly, like humans
grappling with being dehumanized?
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
is real. Chronic pain is real. Anxiety
is real. Depression is real. Take our
minds seriously. Take us seriously.
Stop telling us you care and show us
youdo.

Taking action on a two state solution

I

Unhealthy election habits

Idon't think I'm cut out to be a politician.
Not that anyone was asking, but I should
probably expound.
Over the past several
weeks, I had been working on
running for co-editorial page
editor of this newspaper. The
preparation for the election
included meeting with nearly
all the top-level editors of the
paper, potential editors for
next year and other members
involved at the paper in order
to formulate future ideas DEREK
and receive feedback. All of WOLFE
this culminated in a two-
hour question-and-answer
session, which occurred last
Friday evening.
During this process, I met more fellow
colleagues - trying to sound professional, here
- than I had in the past two years. And by all
means, it was highly productive and fun. I also
got to know some of the younger members of
the opinion section who are working to join the
editorial board and possibly become editors.
That is particularly exciting. My counterpart,
Aarica Marsh, and I were able to develop our
vision for the opinion section by incorporating
aspects of what makes the other sections
successful and work on talking points for the
election. And for those wondering at home, we
won - yes, the election was uncontested, but
still, a victory is a victory. I couldn't be more
enthused to lead this section.
There is nothing inherently wrong with
what I described. We took all the right and
necessary steps to prepare for a successfulyear.
However, while it's hard to precisely define it,
there is something slightly disingenuous about
the election process.
What I mean by this is that whenever I would
introduce myself to someone new on staff I
worried about it coming off to the person like,
"I'mintroducing myselfto you only because I'm
running and want your support." The reality
is I enjoy meeting new people, but there was
always the concern that the looming election
blurred my intentions - that I was being fake.
There is no denying that this process
accelerated, even encouraged, a social
process, which in the long term is beneficial
for when we hire an edit staff and familiarity
with one another has been established.
But, I guess what I'm saying is that I'm
uncomfortable engaging in a relationship
where only I have something to gain in the

short term - in this case, winning an election.
I can't even imagine how it would be if Aarica
and I ran against someone else.
While elections are necessary for our great
democracy, the dynamics that accompany
them are incredibly complicated and overall
unhealthy. Through my anecdotal evidence
alone, it's clear that it's difficult to gauge
one's true motivations. And this isn't just a
Daily problem. It's a societal problem. And it
affects everything and everyone from high
school youth groups - something I also have
experience with - to the presidential election.
Who can you trust? Which candidate cared
more about me? Both questions, in a society
where 99.9 percent of people aren't trained in
psychoanalysis, are tough to answer.
Take the 2014 midterm elections as another
example where the answers of those questions
are risked. We gambled on who "meant
it" more. Across the country, hundreds of
candidates, most notably for the U.S. House
of Representatives and gubernatorial races,
were enthusiastically making bold claims and
promises on how they could improve my life
as an American citizen.
Nov. 1, I attended a Democratic rally at
Wayne State University where President
Barack Obama spoke to endorse then-
candidates Gary Peters and Mark Schauer.
During his speech, Obama said, "You have
the chance to choose leaders that don't put
political ideology first, that don't put just
winning an election first - they put you first."
That is classic election rhetoric. Of course,
I want to believe that Gary Peters does put
me first. But, especially with national and
statewide elections, he was also fighting for
his career. He's trying to get paid. That's his
number one goal.
The Daily is a bit different. If you saw how
much a writer gets paid per article you'd
know money isn't a motivator. I'm sure this
is also the case for other student groups
across campus.
But for me, especiallywhen I don't know the
candidate very well, elections automatically
generate a sense of skepticism because it's all
talk and no walk - sorry for the cliche.
I'm excited that election season is over.
It's time to get to work. I want to prove I'm
a man of my word.
Hopefully our representatives will do
the same.

for a Palestinian Solidarity Shab-
bat. The stated reason, according
to the students who tried to orga-
nize it, was that Hillel felt that the
term "Palestinian solidarity" was
exclusive. The suggested event,
organized by individuals associated
with Jewish Voice for Peace, but not
sponsored by JVP explicitly, was
suggested as a moment in which to
bring a conversation about Pales-
tinian lives into Hillel as part of the
ShabUM program.
However, Hillel International,
the umbrella organization for all
Hillelsglobally,hasguidelinesabout
what kinds of Israel programming
they will host or sponsor. According
to the guidelines, Hillel-affiliated
institutions will not partner with
or host anyone that, among other
things, supports the movement to
boycott, divest from or sanction
Israel, companies that operate in
Israel or companies that operate
in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories. JVP supports the
Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions
movement, and so the organization
falls outside those guidelines. Yet,
regardlessofhowwe feelaboutBDS,
JVP or Hillel and its guidelines,
the conversation here has been
about the title of the program,
Palestinian Solidarity Shabbat.
But our Hillel says they support
a two-state solution, and that
must mean standing in solidarity
with Palestinians.
We at J Street UMich want to
see our institutions better grapple
with what it means to care for and
about Palestinians. Supporting
Palestinian sovereignty is not anti-
Israel. Because the University
of Michigan Hillel has publicly
declared support for a two-state
solution, supporting Palestinian
sovereignty is well within our
Hillel's values. We have seen Hillel
demonstrate its commitment to two
states in the past - including when
they hosted Americans for Peace
Now last year. We value our Hillel
for this, and for its willingness to
take a stand on one of the most vital

issues facing the Jewish people and
the State of Israel. Yet, if we believe
in a two-state solution, we cannot
care only for the Jewish state and
disregard our future Palestinian
neighbor. A two-state solution
means what it says: a Jewish and
democratic Israel alongside a viable
Palestine. We cannot support one'
without supporting the other. To
do so only pays lip service to our
common cause.
As pro-Israel students, we are
deeply concerned about the security
of Israel and the risks the occupation
poses to it. We too think deeply
about our values of Zionism and
the safety of the Jewish homeland,
and we applaud Michigan Hillel for
its public support for a two-state
solution. But we have also grown up
in communities that claim support
for a two-state solution and then
devalue or disregard the people who
will live in that second state. This is
a challenge facing the entire Jewish
community - and one that inhibits
public support for two states into
action. To ensure that this public
support leads to a sustainable
future for Israelis and Palestinians,
we must have more conversations
about what it means to support
Palestinian futures.
We understand that having a
deep conversation about Palestin-
ians and Palestinian sovereignty
will be a challenge for the Jewish
community, and for this campus at
large, because many of us have been
taught that to be active in this con-
versation, you must pick one side or
the other. But we at J Street UMich
think there is a better path. As a
dedicated pro-Israel student group,
J Street UMich is a proud member
of Hillel's Israel Cohort - a body of
self-identifying pro-Israel student
organizations on campus. Our sup-
port for Palestinian statehood does
not preclude our membership. On
the contrary, it makes us the best
pro-Israel advocates we can be -
ones who are willing to wrestle
with what it means to support two
states, and what it means to care
for the long-term sustainability
of both peoples. Michigan Hillel
will fully act on its values when it
opens spaces that include deep dis-

cussion about Palestinian sover-
eignty - and they can, and should,
create space for this conversation.
In fact, they must, because being
pro-Israel and pro-Palestine are
mutually interdependent.
Michigan Hillel can lead the
charge for a two-state solution - in
many ways, it has already taken deci-
sive steps by supporting the two-
state solution publicly. This is why
we are excited that today, J Street
UMich is hosting Rabbi Arik Ascher-
man, an outspoken Jewish advocate
for human rights in the occupied
Palestinian territories, and the presi-
dent and senior rabbi of Rabbis for
Human Rights, at Hillel. By welcom-
ing Rabbi Ascherman into its build-
ing, Hillel has taken this moment
to demonstrate its values. But he
is not Palestinian, and we must
have Palestinian voices within Hil-
lel. Given the events of the last few
weeks and months, it is even more
important for us to understand each
other's narratives.
We at J Street UMich are proud to
be part of a Hillel that has afforded
us the ability to have such program-
ming in the face of a Jewish com-
munity that often does not, and even
more proud to be part of a Hillel
that understands the necessity of a
two-state solution to ensure Israel's
future. And, we want our visible sup-
port for Palestinian sovereignty to be
as unequivocal as we say it is. "Pales-
tinian self-determination" is not an
exclusive term that shuts out Israeli
self-determination, and breaking
down such stereotypes is necessary
for promoting two states. We know
our Hillel is dedicated to the two-
state solution, so we would like to see
our Hillel invite Palestinian speak-
ers in the future. If we support the
autonomy of both Israelis and Pal-
estinians, advocating for Palestinian
self-determination is essential. It can
start here at the University. We are
eager for Hillel to join us.
J Street UMich will be hosting
Rabbi Arik Ascherman of Rabbis for
Human Rights today Nov.19 at 8 p.m.
at Hillel.
Micah Nelson is an Public Policy
junior and an executive board
member at J Street UMich.

Frangoise
Mouly, Art Editor of The New
Yorker. Along with her husband,
comic book luminary Art
Spiegelman, author of best-selling
"Maus," Mouly brought comics
from the fringe underground of
basement bookstores to the haute-
couture of The New Yorker covers
and museum retrospectives.
Thursday, Mouly will give a
Penny Stamps lecture in which
her love of print publishing and
the comics medium will serve as
focal points to encourage future
generationsto push boundaries and
recognize opportunities to keep
print publishing thriving.
Like many French kids, Mouly
grew up with children's comics, so
when she moved to New York at
age 19, she thought there would be
no better way to learn English than
through captioned illustrations.
Yet there were no con is 4p the
mainstream bookstores or on the
newsstands. A friend introduced
her to the underground cartoonist
Art Speigelman, and she fell in love
with the artist's advocacy for his
medium - and later with the artist
himself. Through the 1980s, the
two co-edited RAW magazine, an
annual anthology of the year's best
and most progressive work in the
comicsgenre.
"I wanted to make an object that
showed all of the possibilities of
how comics could function to tell
stories, to illustrate articles,toshow
verydifferentstyles," Moulysaid in
an interview with The Michigan
Daily. "That this wasn't just science
fiction or superheroes, but it could
beliterature; itcouldbe art.
The desire there was again to
demonstrate a museum quality
gathering of comics and a bit in
reactiontotheundergroundcomics
that Art came from which thought
of comics like this is lowbrow
culture to be read on the toilet. But
I'd seen work, including that of my
 husband,thatIthoughtwas worthy
of not being trash and being kept
andbeing read again and again and
had a lot of qualities that made it on
par with art and literature. So that
was the impulse at the time .. to
presentthingsthewayIsawthat."
RAWwasquiteaDIYoperation:
Mouly was its publisher, designer,
production manager and printer,

using her own printing press
located in their Soho loft. Mouly
and Spiegelman chose the comic
strips together, resulting in
editorial diversity.
"We had a common vision and
we wanted to bring very different
artists," Mouly said. "I was

probably more the advocate for the
conceptual work - I did most of
theillustratedtextpieces. Iwrote a
couple andI did layouts for those; I
wanted graphics that weren't pure
comics in the magazine. We both
were of a common accord that we
wanted a range of artists ... we put
our tastes together and that's a
good way to do it."
"Half the people or more were
our friends," Mouly said. "You
know we had met them, we had
spent time with them, we shared
many evenings talking about how
great comics could be, so it was a
gathering of a lot of different ideas
and different people that were in
different countries, and it was very
exciting because everybody we
published we loved'
The same is true of Mouly's
work as the Art Editor of the New
Yorker.
"All of the artists that I publish,
I pretty much broughtto (The New
Yorker) - such as Robert (Crumb)
and Chris Ware and Charles Burns
and Adrian Tomine and Peter
de Seve. There's pretty much no
artist that's being published that
isn't somebody I brought either
from my old connections or (from)'
discovering their work as I went
along, because I've been doing this
for a while now."
Mouly sees The New Yorker as
a publication that values not only
the aesthetic merit of comics and
cartoons, but also the medium's
power to make a statement,
political or otherwise.
"The New Yorker has of course
a long tradition of cartoons and
of artists being integrated as part
of the contributors," Mouly said.
"One thing that isterrific with The
New Yorker, besides all of the other
wonderful things that we do, is
that we publish the work of artists
as full-fledged contributors, not
just to illustrate somebody else's
workbut the cover is asigned work
by a cartaonist An that seldom
happens in this day and age: that
cartoonists have their voice and
their ideas'
Mouly's process of choosing a
New Yorker cover takes the form
of an ongoing conversation with
the artist to come up with the right
image at the righttime.As aweekly
general interest magazine, The
New Yorker has a quick response
time to current events, but isn't
expected to cover everything that
happens. Mouly's New Yorker
cover caneitherstand onit'sownas
a stylized illustration of seasonal/
cultural themes or can serve as a
timely commentary on a breaking
issue of the day.
"I'm in a dialogue with the
artists so what I try to do is to
encourage them to use this cover
of a magazine as a forum to address
the concerns that they might have
... I actually believe that those
cartoonists and those graphic
storytellers should be telling the
story of our times," Mouly said.
She famously edited the
controversial cover in 2008
depicting Barack and Michelle
Obama as closet militant
revolutionaries in Arab garb fist-
bumping their election to the
White House - a caricature of
those who really believe it. The
controversy was that the targets
of the caricature - and there was
no shortage of them in our nation

- didn't get it, seeing instead a
magazine cover that perfectly
capturedtheirviews.
"The thing that's great with
New Yorker readers is that they're
all very sophisticated," Mouly
said. "We can publish images that
are ironic, that are funny, that are

provocative, and they don't have
captions and they don't tell you
what to think, but they presume
that the reader is able to formulate
his or her own opinion, and that's
a great privilege. It's totally the
best thing we have from being The
New Yorker is that we don't have
to caption and explain ourselves
or take it back and we can trust our
readers trust their intelligence."
In 2012, Mouly published a
collection of the covers that didn't
make the magazine entitled
"BlownCovers:NewYorker Covers
You Were Never Meant to See."
The selectivity is the product of a
highvolume ofsketchsubmissions,
yet sometimes the message is not
quite right for the magazine. The
collection stands as a testament to
Mouly by showcasing the breadth
and depth of the art that her
editorship generates, revealing
Mouly's taste for the provocative
and her discerning eye among it.
Mouly also publishes TOON
Books, a series of comics for kids.
As a mother, Mouly recognized
the special place hard copy comics
can occupy for kids the way they
did for her. Mouly views comics as
a transformative keyhole for kids
to see through to power of art and
literature in their lives.
"It's great medium for kids and it
is how youmap out afuture for kids
to love books and to love reading
and to get into holding a story.
It has some magical component
because whenyou read abookby a
cartoonist whether it be Dr. Seuss
or Maurice Sendak or William
Steig, you see the hand of the artist
who actually made those marks
andtoldthatstory,"Moulysaid.
Mouly doesn't ignore digital
technology at The NewYorker. She
edited a cover drawn on an iPad,
by David Hockney, for the first
iPad edition of the magazine and
has edited animated covers for the
online edition.
"(Thefirstanimated'yewYorker
Cover was a) poetic image by
ChristopherNeimanofrainfalling,
just rain drops seen through the
window of a cab. So that was our
first moving cover, it was moving
everywhere except of course on
the print issue ... It was such a
perfect New Yorker cover because
it was very abstract, it was like a
dozen raindrops basically. Nobody
else could get away with being so
conceptual and minimalist and so
tongue-and cheek,butwhenyou're
The New Yorker you can do that.
Everybody else would have to be
doing some kind of production
number with some kind of like big
deal moving parts, and we can do
the simplething."
Comics, more so than typeset
books, convey the physical act of
creation. Maybe that's the reason
their fans tend to demand them
in print rather than digital form.
Mouly includes the genre among
her pantheonofsaviorsofthe print
publishing industry.
"I want to share my own
enthusiasm for where we're at in
publishing. Because I am in the
midst of New York City publishing
where a lot of people are in despair
because book publishers are
experiencing alot ofhardship.And
(with) magazines it's difficult -
this is true of various magazines
(and) newspapers - we are in the
midst of a tectonic plate shift in

terms ofpublishingandthingsthat
I like such as books, but because
I am at The New Yorker per se,
and involved with publishing
children's books, and involved with
publishingcomics,Ifeelthat we are
at a very optimistic point, that the
future is bright."

Groove to bring
performance groups
to State Theater
By CAROLINE FILIPS
For The Daily
The all-too-familiar thud of

and it somehow ended up in the.
back ofthe
fridge" Thanksgroovin'
takeout
container Nov. 21 at 7:30 p.m.
after its State Theater
descent
to the Students $5,
bottom Adults $8
of the
trashcan is something we
don't think twice about. Yet
to those as musically minded
as the University's percussion
performance group, Groove,
that nuance becomes a source of
inspiration for one's work.
"It's mostly just the creative
spark, whenyouhearsomething,"
said LSA senior and Groove
president Vincent Sheu. "For
us it's just everyday life, we're
constantly hearing sounds and
interpreting that as 'oh, that could
be something we do in Groove."'
Throughout its 11-year
presence on campus, Groove has
been the University's premier
high-energy percussion and
performance group, known for
transforming ordinary objects
into musical devices. Writing all
their own music, and building
their own instruments, the group
incorporates an unmatched
creativityinto each performance.
"What we do is we play a lot of
music and we drum onthingsthat
you normally wouldn't consider
instruments," Sheu said. "Most

people see us on the Diag playing
trashcans, and we do that in the
week leadingup to our big show."
Groove has certainly grown
since its founding in 2003 and
has continued to maintain an
extensive following.
"Itusedto be a small group that
was performing in Angell Hall
auditoriums which only seat a
few hundred people," Sheu noted.
"Two years ago we actually sold
out the Michigan Theatre which
was like 1500 people ... a really
big turnout and we were all really
happy with that."
Consisting of approximately
30 members and selectively
adding only about eight out
of 60 auditioning each year,
Groove stands as a selective
and competitive student
organization. In order to make
the cut, one must be well versed
in the various aspects of the
musical creative process -
playing, writing and performing
original music is key. Though
the group is focused primarily
on percussion instruments,
many members are guitar and
keyboard musicians as well.
"We really try to branch out
in terms of all the differenttypes
of music that we play, but we
always try to keep it with that
unique sound and that unique
instrument feel," Sheu said. "We
compare very heavily to Stomp
and Blue Man Group. In our show
we actually write a lot of really
diverse music ranging from
heavy drum line sort of songs to
unique songs you would see at a
Stomp show or Blue Man Group
and also covers of popular music
like indie songs or something
that's on the radio."
This impressive range is
sure to be showcased both 'in
the Diag this week and at their

upcoming annual winter show,
Thanksgroovin'.
"It's going to be a lot of fun,
we're getting in a lot of new
sounds that we haven't been
able to in the past just with new
technology and new keyboards
and synthesizers, things like
that," Sheu said. "Our newbie
class this semester has blown
all of our expectations out of
the water and some of the songs
they're writing are just amazing."
This year's show will also
feature a few University a
cappella groups, opening
with Compulsive Liars and
collaborating with The Dicks &
Jane's for the cover of Animal
Collective's "My Girls." Groove
will also be covering "High For
This" by Ellie Goulding with
Michigan's Pop Orchestra.
"It's a really crazy blend of
songs this semester, and there's
going to be a lot of really cool
covers," Sheu said.
Also featured is the group's
new exclusive mason jar
instrumental, filled with water
to 1create differing pitches. A
song stylized after a traditional
Filipino dance of coconut shell
body percussion is also included
in the lineup, along with a song
of kitchen cutlery instruments.
"We're doing a song with all
those sort of things, just hitting
tumblers and glasses and forks
and knives and things like that
and that's also made into a skit
...in another piece, we play on
ladders, we play on trash cans
and bass cans and like Home
Depot buckets as well," Sheu
said.
Though a four-year Groove
performer, Sheu admits his
favorite moment of each show
is the audience's own rhythm of
applause.

Mbrings opera to students

SMT&D puts on a
powerful, emotional
performance
By REBECCA GODWIN
Daily Arts Writer
For many college students,
opera isn't the most appealing
art form. Images of Viking
helmets, sad Italian clowns
and women in red dresses
are what come to mind most
often. However, "Dead Man
Walking," created by Jake
Heggie and Tony-Award-
winning playwright Terrence
McNally, is not your typical
opera. Put on by the School of
Music, Theatre & Dance, the
show was powerful, moving
and far beyond a skeptical
college student's expectations.
The opera, which is based
on a true story, revolves
around Sister Helen Prejean
as she works as the spiritual
advisor to Joseph De Rocher,
a death row convict who
was convicted, along with
his brother, of murdering a
teenage couple. The two form
a relationship through the
duration of the opera, which
starts just before the pair's
first face-to-face meeting and
concludes shortly after De
Rocher's execution.
Sarah Coit, a graduate
student studying vocal
performance, played Sister.
Helen. Her voice was rich and
beautiful, and it rarely seemed
as though she was struggling
to reach any of the notes. Her
acting sometimes felt a little
disconnected from what she
was singing, as though she
was focusing on remembering
the words or notes and wasn't
actingthem. In some scenes her
reactions felt a little weak and
she would often look out into
the audience or over a fellow
actor's shoulder instead of in
their eyes. This was especially
noticeable in the more intense
scenes when there needed to be

a strong connection between
characters. But Coit navigated
the intense emotional content
with a poise that made the
majority of her scenes touching
and poignant - delivering a
stunning performance overall.
James Schmid, a senior
studying vocal performance,
played Joseph De Rocher and
stole the show. His singing
and acting were both spot
on, playing the emotional
turmoil his character was
going through beautifully.
The character of De Rocher
is a subtle balance of bravado
and genuine emotion, and
Schmid excelled in portraying
the emotional journey De
Rocher goes on as he realizes
he is going to be executed.
There were a few scenes that
really stuck out to me with
Schmid's performance, such as
the childlike qualities Schmid
gave De Rocher as he tried to
apologize to his mother in a
truly heartbreaking scene. The
second scene was De Rocher's
execution; Schmid played the
scene so realistically that it
was actually upsetting and
painful to watch as he was
killed.
There were a few other
performances that really stuck
out as well. Graduate student
Angela Nieman, senior Nora
Burgard, graduate student
LonnieReedandjuniorMichael
Miller played the parents of
the two teenagers De Rocher
killed with heart wrenching
accuracy. Miller, in particular,
played the devastated father of
the young girl so well that it
was impossible not to tear up
at his grief. Graduate student
Natasha Drake, who portrayed
De Rocher's mother, also gave
a powerful peformance as the
loyal mother who refused,
even at the very end, to believe
her son was capable of such a
horrendous crime.
The staging was well done
and realistic, but at times
could be a little disturbing and
hard to watch. For instance,

the opening scene shows
De Rocher and his brother
attacking the young teenage
couple. The audience not only
saw the pair beat the couple,
but you also saw De Rocher
rape the girl and then stab her
repeatedly while his brother
shot the boy. Later, during
De Rocher's execution, they
actually strapped Schmid to
an execution table and then
hooked him up to an incredibly
realistic looking lethal
injection machine, which lit up
and made noises. The attention
to detail for these scenes was
impressive, but at the same
time seeing such realistic and
accurate depictions left the
audience reaching for tissues
to wipe away tears, which
meant people missed some of
the things that happened after
as they were trying to calm
themselves down.
The set was simple and
directed the audience's focus
onto the actors. There were
supertitles above the stage
that displayed exactly what
the actors were singing, which
proved quite helpful during
some parts. The only thing that
proved to be a little annoying
was the imbalance between
speaking and singing. The
majority of the show was sung,
but there were moments where
it felt like the actors were just
singing to sing, and they could
have just as easily spoken their
lines. But this has less to do
with the production itself and
more to do with the creators of
the opera, as well the genre, in
general.
"Dead Man Walking" was
not simply a sad story with
no message. Every character,
including De Rocher, was so
incredibly human down to
each and every fault, that it
made choosing a side difficult;
regardless of your own
beliefs, there was a legitimate
argument for both sides. It left
you questioning and thinking,
and any show that can do that
is a show worth seeing.

BLACK STUDENT UNION I
#BBUM one year anniversary

Today marks the one year anniversary
of #BBUM, Being Black at the University of
Michigan. The Black Student Union created this
Twitter campaign in hopes of giving a voice to the
Black experience at the University. This campaign
quickly garnered national attention, and inspired
similar movements on other college campuses
across the nation.
Although a year has passed, the Black Student
Union's work continues. After releasing the
hashtag last year, it, along with members of
the Black community issued seven demands to
University officials on Martin Luther King Day.
Students demanded full restoration of the BSU's

budget, affordable housing on Central Campus, a
new centrally located multicultural center, revision
to the Race and Ethnicity requirement, emergency
scholarships for Black students, increased
disclosure of documents within the Bentley
Library and an increase in Black representation on
campus equal to 10 percent.
Though the hashtag campaign remains a revered
instance of student activism on campus, the BSU
and members of the Black community will continue
striving to make more than a symbolic impact.

'Who'a depressing end

Fashion propels
Jessica Lange's
femme fatale
By CATHERINE SULPIZIO
Daily Arts Writer
There is a reason Jessica
Lange is one of the most popular
characters on "American Horror
Story" every season. She plays
the femme fatale in a sea of
forgettable female TV personas,
the unapologetic villainess who
makes being bad look damngood.
Of course, Lange's brand of
fashion has always had a tenuous
history with female politics. In the.
June 9, 1909 edition of the New
York Times, a headline blared
"NEW WOMAN A FREAK, SAYS
BISHOP DOANE." In the byline,
it continued "One Who Strives for
Man's Work a Horrible, Misshapen
Monster." The titillating headline
referred to a Bishop's ill-advised
graduation speech at an all girls
school in New York, where
he railed against the growing
suffragette movement.
The New Woman of his speech
was an entirely new cut of female;
in an 1895 edition of Home Chat,
a women's magazine, a satirical
poem wrote: "Who rides a cycle
round the town, in costume
making all men frown, and
otherwise acts like a clown? New
Woman."
The Bishop didn't subscribe
to Home Chat (he probably
inherited his institutional sexism
from his employer), but what both
narratives have in common is their
alignment of the New Woman as
a "freak," or "a clown." In their
complete forms, both yoke the
New Woman's fashion to their
indictment; after all, she cut her
hair short, wore bloomers to bike
ride and abandoned the fussy
volume ofVictoriansilhouettes.
Fashion continues to carry this
gendered baggage. Damned if you
have an interest in it and damned if
you don't - just look at how critics
treat Hillary Clinton's unfussy
style. The label of deformity
applied to genderless fashion
signals that to be a strong female is
to be estranged from society.
Which is exactly why the
mutable femme fatale embraces

She's going to break your heart in two ... it's true.

this label. After all, it is harder
to police the outsider than the
member of society who has
swallowed the status quo. The
femme fatale wears strangeness
on her sleeve: she is sexual then
asexual, wearing prickly tweed or
silk that glistens like liquid on her
skin.
If Lange's past characters paid
whispered tributes to the femme
fatale, Elsa uproots the lady of
noir' from her restrained Hays
Code heyday and thoroughly
modernizes her. Elsa is a former
dominatrix, sexual assault victim
turned abuser, aspiring singer,
circus ringleader - Elsa accepts
with relish the "complicated" label
TV critics love.
And all of it is reflected in her
style, which uses strange fabrics
and colors, and doubles back on
earlier eras. Take the powder blue
suit Elsa wears when she performs
David Bowie's "Life on Mars."
As costume designer Lou Eyrich
noted, "We fashioned it after a'40s
suit, but atake off of the blue suit
that David Bowie wore. So, it's a
'40s version of a '70s suit." But the
suit isn't just anachronistic, it's
distinctly androgynous with its
large lapels and boxy shape.
In fact, much of Elsa's
costuming tugs back and forth
between two opposites, which
comes to characterize Elsa who is
both cruel and compassionate. In
her first appearance, Elsa strides
in the hospital with a voluminous

black and white fur coat. The fur
makes a statement, but so does the
coat's ultra-accentuated shoulder
pads. Elsa takes up physical space
in these shots. The black toque
cap she wears has spiky feathers,
sensuous yet intrusive. Even in
a pink suit she wears later that's

Drake's Take Care debuted in
2011, during my junior year of
high school. At that time, I knew
Drake only as the artist who
sang that one song that kept say-
ing "you the fuckin' best" over
and over again, and I was like I
get it, your girl is thefuckinghbest.
And while both So Far Gone and
Thank Me Later, his previous
efforts released in 2009 and
2010 respectively, had been suc-
cessful, it wasn't until Take Care
that I realized Drake actually
had some soul.
This month, three years later
after its release on Nov. 15, Take
Care celebrated its third birth-
day, which got me wondering:
what made the album so spe-
cial? After its release, it was a
go-to for all my high school's
awkward party bus escapades,
which included trying to grind
on each other and take swigs
from water bottles full of alco-
hol all the while in a moving
vehicle. And today, it still con-
tinues to pop up on party playl-
ists wherever I go.
Maybe it's because we saw a
more experienced Drake bare
his heart for his fans with songs
like "Marvin's Room," where he
pleaded over a drunk phone call
with his ex, "Talk to me now /
don't have much to believe in /
I need you right now / are you
down to listen to me?" But,
of course he has to remind us
he's not that sensitive and still
smokes weed, gets pussy, and
makes money. So, he attempts
to cover up his vulnerability in
tracks like "Headlines," where
he claims he's "too strung out
on compliments / over-dosed on
confidence."


Maybe it's because this album
introduced Drake's "I'm actu-
ally a really sensitive guy who
sometimes acts like an asshole
because I'll always be apprehen-
sive about fame" persona that
has been present in his work
since. He highlighted this char-
acter in songs like "Underground
Kings," explaining, "Sometimes I
need that romance / sometimes I
need that pole dance."
Maybe it's because the album
birthed the monumental and gen-
eration-defining term "YOLO"
- You Only Live Once - as well
as the less significant but, in my
opinion, equally as important,
"HYFR" - Hell Yeah Fuckin'
Right.
Maybe it's because Drake
broke genre barriers, explor-
ing both R&B and hip hop. Take
Care featured grand piano solos,
sample tracks from R&B legends
like Gil Scott-Heron and free-
styles from heavy hitters like
Rick Ross. Drake recruited other
big names like Lil Wayne, Andre
3000, the Weeknd, Nicki Minaj
and Rihanna. The final product
was an album soaked in emo-
tion and a multitude of different
sounds.
"I change rap forever" Drake
sings on "Lord Knows." And in
truth, with this album, he did.
He helped usher in a new era of
hip hop, one that prided itself
on laying all feelings and fuck
ups out on the table for fans to
examine. He presented listeners
with a funky and sensuous com-
pilation of tracks that undoubt-
edly featured some of the best
rapping and singing we'd seen
from him up to that point.
And, just last weekend, I
heard "Crew Love" at a party.
So, obviously people aren't done
with Take Care just yet.

Help defense difference in Game 2

Early start to
Monday's game
gave Michigan
needed edge
By JAKE LOURIM
Daily SportsEditor
Just before tip-off Monday
night, Big Ten Network aired
Michigan men's basketball
coach John Beilein's last-minute
pregame notes to his team. He
had written four keys to success
on offense and defense, but the
fourth on defense stood out.
"KNOW AND BELIEVE
THAT DEFENSE WINS
CHAMPIONSHIPS!" it said.
To an outsider, there were no
championships to be won when
the Wolverines hosted Bucknell.
But the game was in the regional
round of the Legends Classic,
and Michigan treated it as such.
"We're in a championship
right now - we're trying to win
the Legends Classic," Beilein
said. "Champions don't come out
slow. Champions come out from
the get-go, and we did."
On the very first possession,
Bucknell guard Chris Hass
dribbled past Michigan junior
guard Caris LeVert toward
the baseline. There, he was
surroundedby freshman forward
Kam Chatman and sophomore
guard Derrick Walton Jr., and he
had to kick it out.
So it was for most of the night.
Things didn't get much easier for
the Bison.
Though Michigan's shooting
heated up quickly and the
Wolverineshadplentyofoffense
to survive a mediocre defensive
effort, Monday's 77-53 rout
began on the defensive end.
After Michigan gave up three
early 3-pointers Saturday against
Hillsdale and trailed 10-2 after

Sophomore guard Derrick Walton Jr's standout defense was overshadowed by his team-high eight rebounds.

just 3:22, the Wolverines started
Monday's game with more
energy, consistently rushing to
help on defense.
"Getting to the mid-line when
the ball is on is a thing thatseems
so simple, and it's hard to do,"
Beilein said. "You've got action
on the weak side, and you've got
to get a guy to the mid-line. A
couple weeks ago, that wouldn't
have happened, but we've really
been emphasizing getting a
guy in that circle. (Hass) was
threatening to use a ball screen,
but he went the other way, and
Caris had some help."
On the second possession,
Hass - a native of Pellston,
Michigan - dished to forward
Dom Hoffman on a pick-and-roll.
But Michigan redshirt freshman
forward Mark Donnal stepped
out in the paint and forced a
traveling violation. Then, Donnal
and sophomore forward Zak

Irvin stepped out on a 3-pointer,
forcing a bad miss.
And before Bucknell could
catch its breath, the Wolverines
led 10-0. They were ahead by
at least seven for the rest of the
night, expanding the gap to 29by
halftime.
"Just knowing our last game,
we kind of lost the first four-
minute war, and after that was
kind of fighting back," Walton
said. "We wanted to be the guys
to make the first initial punch, so
tonight was all about setting the
tone from the jump."
Michigan has ranked higher in
points per possession than points
allowed per possession for each of
the past four seasons. Its offense,
with quick passing and a high
volume of 3-point shots, is better
known than its defense.
Yet on Monday, the defense
set the tone for the Wolverines'
win. Michigan held Bucknell

to 39.6-percent shooting from
the floor, including 31.8 percent
in the first half. Perhaps
more importantly, it forced 17
turnovers.
Help defense was at the heart
of that statistic. The guards
were able to jump into passing
lanes and create steals, and the
forwards rotated over to fill in
the gaps.
In each, game, Beilein has
subbed in at least 12 players,
creating several different lineup
combinations. Despite all of
the changes, the Wolverines
held firm on Monday, trapping
Bucknell all over the court.
It started on the first
possession, and it didn't let up
much from there.

Wolverines overcoming
early runs to begin season

The Michigan women's soccer team exceeded expectations this season, but still finished short of the NCAA Tournament.
Youth dooms 'M' in 2

By ISAIAH ZEAVIN-MOSS
Daily Sports Writer
On Nov. 5, the Michigan
women's soccer team played its
final game of the season, falling to
Minnesota, 1-0,indoubleovertime
in the first round of the Big Ten
Tournament.
How the Wolverines got to
that point, though, is much more
complicated than a simple statistic
can tell.
Michigan had plenty of work to
do before the season started. Last
season's squad made it to the Elite
Eight of the NCAA Tournament,
but graduating eight seniors made
the offseason transition difficult.
And Michigan coach Greg Ryan
wasn't optimistic about his young
team's potential for success this
fall.
"We knew that this was going
to be a very challenging year,"
Ryan said. "I didn't know what
to expect. I thought, 'We'll do
the best we can, we'll grow a lot
- hopefully we'll build for the
future."'
Thebeginningoftheseasonwas
unkind to the young Wolverines.
A trip to California - where
Michigan was handily defeated
by San Diego and San Diego
State 5-0 and 3-0, respectively
- left the team searching for
answers. Would those hapless
performances be signs of what was
to come?
Those two results alone forced
the Wolverines to prepare for a
rocky season.

"When we were in California,
the captains had a meeting with
the coaches, and we were all kind
of bummed out by the way we had
started the season," said senior
midfielder Jen Pace. "We thought
it was going to be a rebuilding
year."
But the Wolverines went on to
win nine of their next 10 games
and shot up to the top of the Big
Ten standings.
"We justgotbetter every week,"
Ryan said. "These kids kept finding
ways to win."
Sophomore forward Nicky
Waldeck and redshirt freshman
Ani Sarkisiancombined for13goals
in that 10-game span. The young
players were having substantial
impacts on games, and there was
hope that Michigan could perhaps
accomplish somethingspecial.
"We fought for all 90 minutes,
doing what we could in each
moment and each opportunity,"
Pace said. "We still took it one
game at a time, but we had more
confidence in ourselves. We were
able to play against these good
Big Ten teams and gain some
momentum from those games."
However, the Wolverines'
successprovedtobeunsustainable.
A disappointing home loss to
Penn State - Michigan's first
of the season - proved to be
the beginning of the end. The
Wolverines notched only one win
the rest of the season.
Michigan's fate was sealed with
the final loss to Minnesota. The
NCAA selection committee didn't'

give the inconsistent Wolverines
a chance to play in the NCAA
Tournament.
A season ofexcitement and hope
that included several close games
and a few last-minute victories
endedwiththeWolverineswaiting
for their name tobe announced for
the postseason tournament.
"At the end of the season, we
didn't get the breaks we were
getting earlier in the season. If we
had been, we would've won four
or five of our last six games," Ryan
said. "We were on the road for the
last three weeks of our season. We
were at home for the stretch that
we did so well. If you look at most
teams, they have a better home
record than away record. It's not
easy on the road."
But Ryan was thrilled about
his team's season, despite the lack
of invitation from the selection
committee.
"What we achieved this year
is so far beyond anything we
could've asked for," he said. "I told
the team, 'Be proud of yourselves.
You represented Michigan
incredibly well.'"
And while Pace won't be a part
of the 2015 squad, she promised
there are exciting things coming
to the U-M Soccer Stadium in
comingyears.
"Going from having eight
starters leave and basically
forming a new team, it was really
cool to see how much the young
players developed," she said. "It's
going to be really fun to watch
them next season."

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.cam

Faith, fortitude and Abby Col

Just a sophomore,
Abby Cole makes
a difference for
Michigan
By JACOB GASE
Daily Sports Writer
The 6-foot-5 middle blocker
floats toward the net as if she
were on a string, her powerful
right arm striking the ball at the
perfect height.
The ball comes crashing down
from a seemingly impossible
angle, landing with a thunderous
smack between six Illinois
players, just a few feet from the
net. It's not clear whether any of
them actually saw it come down.
In fact, as the ball bounces into
the stands, the Fighting Illini
might be thankful the floor
absorbed the impact and not
them.
Abby Cole doesn't thump her
chest, throw her hands up in
triumph or taunt her opponents
on the other side of the net. She
turns straight to her teammates,
offering each one of them a
high-five before indulging in a
celebratorycheer together.
The sophomore middle
blocker is currently playing the
best volleyball of her life. But she
won't revel in her success.
She ranks amongthe Big Ten's
best in hitting percentage and
kills and won back-to-back Big
Ten Player of the Week honors in
October. But Cole simply wasn't
raised to be proud.
She has the potential to be
one of the greatest Wolverines
to ever step on the court. But
she doesn't care about that, nor
is she likely aware. She turns
to her teammates first because
she doesn't want her story to be
defined by personal success.
Her story isn't one of pure
athletic dominance - it's defined
by hard work, strong principles
and unrelenting faith.
Cole grew up in the small
beach town of Grand Haven,
Michigan, right on the shores
of Lake Michigan. She was born
into a Christian home, where her
parents molded her core beliefs
from a young age. From her
childhood to her present life at
Michigan, Cole's faith has been
the driving force of her journey.
"If I could have someone
describe me, I'd want them to
say, 'She's someone who lives by
what she believes,"' Cole said.
When she left home for college
on the other side of the state,
Cole initially struggled with
the transition. In addition to
the typical college pressures of
academics and living away from
home for the first time, Cole
began her collegiate volleyball
career playing out of position
on the right side after playing
middle blocker her entire life.
And to cope with the demands
of life as a student-athlete, Cole
turned to the same place she
always has: her faith.

Cole remembers going out
to restaurants with her family
when she was seven years old.
Occasionally, hosts or hostesses
would refuse to give Cole a kids'
menu. "Sorry, it's for 12 and
under only,"-they would say.
It wasn't long before Cole
turned to sports to exploit her
height advantage. Basketball
was her first love - from playing
with her dad in her driveway to.
playing on her middle and high
school teams. Her height didn't
just make the game easy - it
affected others' opinions of her
before they even saw her play.
And if it weren't for her height;
Cole may never have gotten the
chancetoevolveintothevolleyball
player she is today. When she
started playing volleyball in the
sixth grade, she struggled with
a lack of coordination - an issue
she wouldn't work out until well
into high school.
Cole wasn't necessarily
talented yet, but in a Midwest
beach town and volleyball
hotspot, it was her height
that literally put her head and
shoulders above the rest. To this
day, she remains convinced that
she only made her high school
varsity team as a freshman
because she was 6-foot-3 and
lanky - "I was literally a
creature," she joked.

VISUAL STATEMENT:
MICHIGAN AVIATORS,

F R O M

T H E

Soaring high above Ann Arbor, members
of the Michigan Aviators look down and
view the Big House from the best vantage
point in town. This is why they fly - the simple
t. calm that exists in a plane, rising above all of
the problems that lie at ground level.
Engineering senior Sandro Salgueiro
formed Michigan Aviators this year to provide
a new club for aviation enthusiasts. The club
regularly takes flight trips across the region.
On Nov. 15, they ventured to Kalamazoo
to enjoy lunch at the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek
International Airport's Air Zoo, a museum
dedicated to showcasing the history of aviation
through full planes that reside in its massive
hangars.
I was given the privilege of riding along
with the clubs assistant flight ops director,

alumni advisor and recent engineering
graduate, Mike Stengel. Stengel, who has
logged over 375 flight hours in his flying career
since the age of 12, took us to new heights in a
Piper PA-28R Arrow.
The plane itself was cozy on the inside,
with elbows frequently bumping. However, the
experience of being able to sit in front of the
controls of a plane and look out and see Ann
Arbor in such a unique way was well worth
waking up early on a Saturday morning.
There is a certain peace that exists when
flying 5,000 feet above the ground at a quick
160 knots, crossing Michigan and looking
out over the clouds and landscape below. The
Michigan Aviators are open to anyone, with
flight trips multiple times per semester as well
as events back on the ground.

Personal Statement: Knowing my nose
by Erika Harwood

my first time: my leg-up on pheidippides
BY IAN DILLINGHAM

It's like running a marathon.
This fall, I found out what
that phrase really means
when I signed up to compete in
my first real marathon. on a brisk
morning, just before 7 a.m., with
Eminem's "Lose Yourself" blasted
over the loudspeakers, I crossed
the starting line and headed out
onto the streets of Detroit in my
26.2-mile quest.
The story of the marathon's ori-
gins is widely circulated among
the running community. As leg-
end has it, the Greek messenger
Pheidippides ran the 26.2-mile
road to Athens after the Greeks
defeated the invading Persians
at the Battle of Marathon in 490
B.C.E.
After proclaiming the good
news to the city's assembly, Phei-
dippides collapsed and died.
Today, more than half a million
people per year complete mara-
thons in the U.S., competing in
well over 1,000 events nationwide.
Everyone knows that mara-
thons are long, but it's hard to
understand just .how long until
you complete one. Median finish-
ing times are about 4:16 for men
and 4:41 for women. That's over
four hours of moderate to severe-
ly strenuous physical activity -
enough to inflict serious damage
on the bodies of even the most
seasoned athletes.
In no uncertain terms, let me
say that I am not a seasoned ath-

9w,


lete. I am, however, a neurosci-
ence major currently enrolled in
courses covering animal physiol-
ogy and cell biology, and this is my
leg-up on Pheidippides.
Modern marathoners begin
training programs months in
advance of race-day, slowly build-
ing up miles and allowing their
bodies to adjust to the strain of
high-mileage running. For my
October race, my first training
run - a two-mile jog around my
neighborhood - took place in
May.
It takes approximately four to
six weeks for bone and muscle
to adjust to the load of running

impacts. While this makes for
an unpleasant start to marathon
training - indeed, the reason
many individuals fail before they
start - the gains made in early
months pay massive dividends
later on.
But the body is just a vehicle for
runners. In order to successfully
run a marathon, you need energy
- namely glycogen derived from
carbohydrates consumed before
the race. The problem for runners
is that the average human only
stores enough glycogen to run
half the distance of a marathon.
This results in the lengthy
process of "carb-loading" during
training and in the days leading
up to the race, essentially tricking
your body into taking on more fuel
than it would need for any normal
activity.
Such understanding of human
physiology is the result of decades
of research by doctors, ath-
letic trainers, nutritionists and
athletes. In my preparations, I
benefited from their work and
successfully completed my first
marathonowhile avoiding the Phel-
dippides' ultimate fate.
Clocking a time of about 4:30,
I was nowhere near the top of
the standings, but having never
run a competitive race in my life,
knowing that I had the ability to
even finish was reward enough.
All it required was planning and
determination (and a little bit of
science).

Mob-

My nose has always been
a very literal standout
physical feature on me.
It really isn't that spectacular
or much of an anomaly - yet it's
been the cause of conversation
for as long as I can remember.
To be fair, it's sizable. And
I can thank genetics for that.
There's that little bump beneath
the bridge - thanks to my mom -
and it balloons outa tad above my
nostrils (credit: Dave Harwood).
Growing up, I never thought of it
as anything but an average nose
- everyone has one and they all
look a little different.
I was a fairly awkward and
weird child, with lots of potential
for ridicule. I was tall - very tall
- as a kid, prompting my curi-
ous seven-year-old peers to fre-
quently ask me if I was held back
(I wasn't, I was just a 5'5" grade
school kid who also happened to
be smart). I was lanky, too, with
a particularly boney backside. In
addition, I wore glasses and was
debilitatingly shy. Oh, and my last
name is Harwood, which if you
haven't noticed is one letter away
from sounding like a not-so-sub-
tle euphemism for a boner.
I rarely got made fun of
though, and never for any of the
aforementioned reasons (OK,
people still make fun of my last
name). When I did get made fun
of though, it was for my nose. I've
been called Pinocchio more times
than I could ever imagine count-

ing, and my obtrusive schnoz
became my calling card when I
moved to Michigan in the sec-
ond grade. One of my best friends
since then still tells the story of
talking to one of the other kids
during recess about "the new girl
with the big nose." She's also the
friend who advised me, 13 years
later, not to get a nose ring (I got
one anyway).
I was never really insecure
about anything in elementary
school aside from constantly
wondering if my patchwork jeans
looked good with my bubble shirt
(note to past-self: be wary of any-
thing that is "one size fits all").
And I certainly never thought
of any part of my body as being
out-of-the-ordinary. But as that
certain facial appendage gar-
nered attention, I started to see
its flaws; the bump, that balloon-
ing. Plus the fact that it was on my
face, impossible to conceal, didn't
help.
Confused, I started to inquire.
"Is my nose really that big?" I
would go on to ask friends and
family more than once. My mom
would always reassure me with
"everyone in this family has a big
nose" and friends would attempt
to do the same by telling me I
would grow into it, as if they were
talking to a pubescent boy about
church slacks.
Growing up as a very single
but very eager teenager, I won-
dered if my nose would ever cause

problems with potential suitors.
Not necessarily that the size of
my nose would drive boys away,
but rather, that it would physical-
ly get in the way of any romantic
prospects. I concluded that guys
with noses equal to or greater in
size to my own were probably off
limits, as I imagined that making
out takes on a new level of diffi-
culty if your lips can never meet.
Fortunately, my assumption
has been proven incorrect (and
a little melodramatic) - but that
doesn't mean the relationship
between me, boys and my nose
has been smooth sailing.
Recently, to the sheer delight
of a teenage me, I was making
out with my boyfriend, nose as
out of the way as it could be. I'd
been getting over a sinus infec-
tion and noticed that things were
... damper than usual. But being
the noble and dignified woman I
am, I marched on.
I could feel the snot increase
at a concerning pace. My boy-
friend started to pull away, and I
went on the defensive.
"I'm snotty, OK! Sorry!" I
admitted.
"No, Erika, you're bleeding!"
This actually made more
sense. Another joy my nose has
brought to me over the course
of my life has been frequent and
occasionally violent nosebleeds.
With a big nose comes big respon-
sibility - and big amounts of tis-
sues and blood loss. Credit for

this one goes, once again, to Dave
Harwood.
I can essentially track my
life's milestones through the
times my nose has encountered
bloodshed: middle school play
practice, my first day of high
school, one of my first college lec-
tures and most recently, macking
on my boyfriend.
I shot up, grabbed a tissue
and bolted toward the mirror. In
short, blood was everywhere; my
cheek, my forehead, my chest, my
hands (literally and figuratively)
were all covered. My boyfriend
suffered a similar fate as my gross
nose-blood was all over his face
as well.
"You bled in my mouth!" he
told me.
A modern-day blood oath,
united in romance.
I checked the pillowcases and
sheets to make sure they were
stain-free and as luck would have
it, they were. I sat on a chair and
"tweaked the beak" as my mom
always urged me to do in these
situations, pinching the bridge of
my nose to slow down the flow of
blood. And sure enough, my nose
was back to normal in a short
while - as normal as my nose can
be anyway.
I've heard people talk about
their noses a lot during my 21
years on this planet - maybe
because they're the cause of a
universal insecurity or maybe
mine is just a good conversation

starter. During these discussion
I've listened to an unsettling
amount of people talk about how
much they wish they could just
get a nose job - a simple solu-
tion to fix a little bump, or shave
it down a bit. I've never been able
to join in on the conversation.
Because for as much trouble as
one very small (but slightly larg-
er than normal) part of my body
has caused me, it's been pretty
crucial to my development as a
human being.
Thanks to my nose, I've
learned to have a sense of humor
about things, and to admire some
of my physical quirks (aside from
that weird bump on my head that
I'm pretty sure is harboring some
shit). I now have a million stories
to fall back on at parties when I'm
feeling too shy to just hop in on
the conversation; from the time
I gushed blood on my boyfriend,
to that time when my old col-
lege friends made a video for me
before I transferred to Michigan,
titled "Behind The Nose," featur-
ing more than enough embar-
rassing pictures and videos of my
time at Illinois.
Everyone has the right to
change what they want about
themselves, and I'm definitely
not here to tell people otherwise.
But I'll take an extra large pro-
trusion on my face (and probably
an iron deficiency) if it means I
can have a little bit of character
and some outrageous memories.

6B Wednesday November19, 2014 // The Statement
On North Campus, a city of driverless vehicles
by Paula Friedrich

v

w

J ust under
the cloud-
flecked Ann
Arbor water tower,
.,_a tiny city is being
built. Curving
asphalt streets
are the only hint
of the project, but
once the asphalt
hardens, build-
ings will be raised,
stoplights strung
up and simulated
pedestrians will
be programmed.
These 32 acres at
the edge of North
Campus will be
home to the Mobil-
ity Transforma-
tion Center's Test
Facility, a complex
built to develop
automated, driver-
less vehicles.
Scheduled to
officially open in
Spring 2015, the
center's test facili-
ty is one of the first
of its kind.
"In actuality, there's probably nothing
else quite like it in the world," said Jim Sayer,
the MTC's deployment director in an inter-
view with The Michigan Daily.
The University has quietly been moving
itself to the forefront of the study and devel-
opment of automated and connected vehicle
technologies. The two terms are similar, but
distinct: Connected vehicles will warn the
driver if traffic is slowing down up ahead,
while automated vehicles take that informa-
tion one step further and actually decrease
the car's speed.
Cars are "connected" to other cars and
to infrastructure through wireless signals.
Traffic lights, for example, might constantly
be broadcasting whether they're at green,
yellow or red. The connected car would
then let the driver know that it's not worth
slowing down because the light is about to
change. The automated car would hit the
brakes.
A fleet of nearly 3,000 connected cars,
trucks and buses were deployed for use on
Ann Arbor streets in 2012 but testing the
full potential of this technology has proved
tricky.
Sayer said that first deployment made
it clear that there was "a lot of movement
working toward automated vehicles," but
that there was no good way to test them
without raising safety concerns.
Automated cars not only react to other
connected vehicles and infrastructure, but
also sense their surroundings with the help

of cameras, lasers, radars and other image
sensing technologies. These are constantly
surveying and calculating so that a vehicle
can react in unexpected situations, like
someone suddenly crossing the street. But
testing to see if the car will do that reliably
isn't something that can be done at the inter-
section of State Street and South University
Avenue.
Two years ago, when Sayer and col-
leagues were sketching bare-bone plans for
the facility, researchers in the field were
closing down parking lots on campus to test
their technologies.
Engineering Associate Prof. Ryan Eustice
said his work on autonomous vehicles for
the Ford Motor Company allowed him to
use their test track. He said the industry test
track looks like an "asphalt lake"- flat, with-
out anything for an automated car to recog-
nize and react to. Eustice said cars need to
be tested to their limit, so the testing space
should be one where a car can safely spin
out when they reach it. Researchers lacked a
way to test automated vehicles in real world
situations, without actually putting them in
the real world.
So Sayer and his team started planning,
trying to figure out how to pack as many
variations of traffic landscapes, signals and
scenarios into 32 acres as possible.
"When folks come out and see it, they're
really surprised by how much we really did
think about," Sayer said. "How much we
were able to cram in and the level of flex-

ibility that's really going to be able to be
afforded."
Sayer said the Mobility Transformation
Center worked closely with a committee
that included researchers from the College
of Engineering, like Eustice, as well as rep-
resentatives from the Michigan Department
of Transportation, like Matt Smith, program
manager for the DOT's Intelligent Trans-
portation Systems program. The group
came together to create a "wish list" of
roundabouts and traffic signals, which was
then handed off to a design firm that worked
through the details.
"It was a very iterative processbecause
we started off with just kind of a white board
so to speak," said Smith. "An open slate with
whatever you want and heck, by the third
or fourth iteration of the process - lo and
behold you had a pretty detailed design of
what the facility is going to look like."
Sayer said that design combines common
driving scenarios with anything that would
be "particularly challenging" for connected
and automated vehicles to deal with: round-
abouts, unpredictable, pedestrian crossings
and railroad grate crossings. Traffic signage
is one of the most difficult things for the
technology to contend with simply because
of the amount and variety of postings.
"Is it mounted on a pole that's on the
opposite side of the road that you're trying to
cross? Is it strung across the roadway diag-
onally? Is it mounted on a pole right at the
stop-bar where you're told to stop?" Sayer

explained.
The challenges are compounded
by the fact that traffic signals are
sometimes written right onto the
road or whipping around on a par-
ticularly windy day. Sayer said that
putting this facility in Michigan
meant that vehicles would also have
to deal with all kinds of inclement
weather.
The MTC worked closely with
the Michigan Department of Trans-
portation to ensure the model city
would be representative of common
traffic situations and ensure all ele-
ments of the facility would be built
to roadway standards. This meant
following MDOT's construction
codes, though not necessarily the
most up to date ones.
"We had to kind of convince the
architects that we did not want to
do that," Eustice said. "We actually
wanted to build things that were
not actually code anymore in some
cases."
Real roads have infrastructure
built to all kinds of different codes.
f This historical layering is what
gives a city its character. The MTC's
ACILITY city, however, will be able to switch
characters. Researchers will have
their choice of multiple sets of signs - Ameri-
can or international, pristine or weathered.
"I got to spend time digging through a
recycle bin at a local municipality salvag-
ing signs that were no longer good enough
for them to have on the street," said Sayer.
"Either because they had faded or they had
graffiti all over them or they had been hit and
were bent."
Like a giant lego set, the only thing that
won't move are the streets - even the build-
ings can be adjusted. They aren't up yet, but
Sayer explained that they will essentially
be giant theater facades. They might be
crammed right up next to the street to simu-
late an old European city or placed 15 feet
away from the curb like homes in suburbia.
"These are all things that automated vehi-
cles are going to have to be able to detect in
the future," said Sayer. "Currently there is a
lot of variation in the way this information is
conveyed to the driver. The driver can differ-
entiate it, the question is how well the auto-
mated vehicles are going to be able to detect
and make sense of the variety of traffic con-
trol signal configurations and signs that are
out there."
That's the question the facility hopes
to help answer come 2015. For individual
researchers, however, they're just itching to
get in.
"I'm one of the guys that's been in these
coned-off parking lots for the last couple
years testing their stuff," said Eustice. "I'm
ready to be user number one."

n light of the news that HRH
Kate Middleton and Prince
William will be visiting New
York City next month, it is only
fitting to discuss the enigma that
is the royal family. It's so puzzling
to me that I, as a proud citizen of
this glorious democracy, am just
one of the millions of Americans
who are oh so very emotionally
invested in everything regard-
ing the royals. Come on, don't act
like you didn't wake up at 4 a.m.
to see the former commoner Kate
Middleton walk into Westminster
Abbey (followed closely by Pippa's
infamous derriere) only to exit as
the future queen of England. We all
know it happened, so don't deny it.
There is no question that the
royal family became the trend-
ing topic after Kate Middleton
quite literally lived out every girl's
dream and became a princess -
from (upper middle class) rags to
riches, they say. But can you blame
us? She is perfection. Her hair is
always on point and she is basically

Sarah Burton's personal Barbie to
dress. And last year, she added the
most in-demand accessory to her
person: Prince George (take that
North).
It's not like the royal family
does much. Kate has some chari-
ties she's involved in, William is
very "militaristic," Harry likes to
play a game of pool while naked
in Las Vegas and the Queen is a
sweet, old grandma who likes to
shower her family with money
and presents - how is this dif-
ferent from any typical American
family, really?
I don't have a problem with my
royal obsession, in fact, I embrace
it. So should you; don't be ashamed
to be emotionally invested in the
lives of the (filthy) rich and fabu-
lous. And yes, while American
"royalty" does also exist, it is just
not the same, which is why I am
currently plotting on how to join
Kate across the pond in Bucking-
ham Palace since Prince Harry has
a full head of hair and is single.

famous by association:
we'll (never) be royals?

THE THOUGHT BUBBLE

"Well, (education) is a powerful tool ... People have been fighting for education since
forever and, you know, I think it's the one tool that sort of can propagate you from an
underdeveloped person - or, if you look wider - a country itself, to a developed nation,
It's the only tool that I think is the most powerful in helping you expand your horizons,
and expand yourself."

THEORY, PRACTICEAND THE NATURE OF A LIBE
1 ILN JAKAB, COMMUNITY CULTURE

As experiential learning becomes more
popular, the University continues to
dapt. When educators plug theory
and praxis based learning, they are refer-
ring to a traditional pedagogy of concepts,
facts, laws or equations - "theory" - paired
with real-world applications and application
of theoretical practices - loosely defined as
"praxis." It may seem easy to think about
theory and praxis-based learning in the sci-
ences - you learn about Newton's laws in lec-
ture and then apply them in lab (OK, maybe
science majors here are a bit more advanced
than that...).
Another intuitive example where theory
meets praxis in curriculum is in pre-profes-
sional programs - Economics majors, for
example, run investment portfolio strategies
against the market, School of Social Work
students intern in the surrounding commu-
nities. Less obvious, however, are the pockets
throughout the University where this bi-level
coursework resides, not to test a hypothesis
or learn skills for a career, but to engage stu-
dents more deeply with liberal arts material.
In LSA, opportunities for theory and
praxis-based learning exist within the soci-
ology department's Project Community, the
psychology department's Project Outreach,
various courses in Women's Studies, History
of Art (in one course, HISTART 393, "Words
about Images: Western Ekphrasis as Criti-
cal Model," taught by Prof. Jennifer Nelson,
students interpret visual images in their
own words), among others. The Center for
Academic Engaged Learning offers support,
resources and grants throughout LSA for this
type of pedagogy.
In The Residential College, this type of
learning is everywhere. The RC was founded
in 1967 with the pairing of theory and praxis
central to its curriculum. The RC's Creative
Writing and Literature major requires stu-
dents to study literature and literary theory,
and then to generate their own literature
within - or without - it.
The Drama major has students study the-
ater as through literature, and then practice
it as a performing art - the minor is "drama:

text to performance."
In the Arts and Ideas in the Humanities
major, students study art forms and humani-
ties disciplines through their social, histori-
cal and theoretical contexts, and are required
to pair their study with studio-type practice
of an art form. The RC foreign language
courses supplement classroom and book
learning with conversational lunches where
students are forbidden to speak any English
to one another. Furthermore, students can
opt for service learning in communities, near
and far, where their studied language is dom-
inant. The Social Theory and Practice major
couples coursework in social scientific meth-
ods and theory with internships and practi-
cal work out in various communities.
"(Theory and praxis is) across the curric-
ulum I think in the RC - that's been a kind
of benchmark or leitmotif that runs through
the curriculum," said Charles Bright, a his-
tory and social theory and practice professor.
"It reflects the fact that the RC does not have
a thematic whole - what it has is moving
between academic learning and practice of
some kind and combining those in ways that
(inform) the education, but also ... are of use
to people in the world."
Just as the students have diverse interests
within the RC, and even within the same
major, so do the professors. Yet the thread of
theory and praxis runs throughout.
Sociology Prof. Ian Robinson is a lecturer
in the RC's Social Theory & Practice major,
and some of his most transformative expe-
riences have been working with students in
his course, "Mexican Labor in North Amer-
ica: Nogales Field Study and Seminar." The
course looks at migrant workers - many of
whom are undocumented - and their chal-
lenges in the U.S. As a pairing with the
-academic seminar, Robinson developed an
in-field component where the class trav-
els to Nogales, Mexico during spring break.
Students live with families, enter factories,
meet with workers and engineers there, and
interview migrants before they crossed the
desert.
"One of the things I really learned from

(the Nogales trips) was just how much more
powerful that was for the students in the
class," Robinson said. "What they would tell
me (were) things like: 'Well I understood the
readings,' ... but they said, 'I didn't really see
how the different pieces fit together until I
was able to see them through the lens of lives
that are actually lived there where it's all a
continuous."'
Robinson described how students become
more passionate about the injustices they
studied during the Nogales trip, and, as a
result, become more motivated in their aca-
demic work. One year, students returned
from the trip and decided to extend their
term project to create a permanent student
organization: Migrant and Immigrant Rights
Advocacy, otherwise known as MIRA. The
group, which still exists, organized two con-
ferences inviting migrants in the community
to speak on campus.
RC Prof. Jeffrey Evans, who has a back-
ground in clinical psychology and just
recently retired from the University Hospital
where he had been director of training for
the adult post-doctoral fellowship program.
He teaches a service learning course at the
hospital as well as courses such as "Art, Mind
and Medicine and Topics in the Science of
Creativity," where students examine creative
expression through a person's sense of well-
being, especially in a clinical setting. In the
RC's hospital service-learning course, "Hos-
pital Volunteers' Service Learning," Evans
assigns an academic paper to his students,
asking them to reflect on their experiences
through the lens of their own respective
interests, whether it be a certain disease, the
healthcare system as they've observed it or
interpersonal relations in the hospital.
"People bring their interests - they might
be more macro or they might be more micro,
and then the resulting papers at the end
are just fascinating," Evans said. "I empha-
size that to students that they should keep
a journal of what strikes them day to day as
they're in there volunteering, and then cre-
ate a paper that shows us how they are filter-
ing this through their own interests. It's not

just a good thing - but it's something that
helps students develop where they're going
- where they want to go."

teaches in the RC, became interested in

aren't just sitting in a class reading, they're

senior Aleah Douglas, a member of the RC,
will complete a degree in English through
LSA and a degree in Drama within the RC,
which she describes as the ultimate theory/
praxis experience:
"The major is so
unusual because typi-
cally you either study
literary theory or you
study performance,
(but here, you) study
the two intertwined,"
she said.

director of the PCAP.
D PCAP "Honestly, having
the workshop was so
important for what we
were learning," Douglas
said. "When you read a
book, a textbook or even
a memoir ... it's still a
removed concept. It doesn't feel up close and
personal. But then going to the workshop and
getting to see in action the different concepts
we were learning about - it was mind blow-
ing."
LSA sophomore Alex Kime, a member of
the RC, learns through a theory and praxis
model in the humanities with his Literature
and Creative Writing major in the RC, and
in the social sciences with his Community
Action and Social Change (CASC) minor in
the School of Social Work. There is a lot of
flexibility within the CASC minor: Students

take the introductory course, Theories and
Practices for Community Action and Social
Change and complete a capstone project. In
between, there are not many requirements
that enforce practice components, but stu-
dents who are self-motivated can seek them
out.
However, Kime said he is wary of Uni-
versity programs that facilitate experiential
learning within outside communities, and
prefers when courses partner with pre-exist-
ing organizations.
"I like it when things are kind of close to
the ground ... A less academic vibe and more
down to earth and (where we are) doing the
work that needs to be done," he said.
Like any bold initiative, theory and praxis-
learning at the University is not all moon-
light and roses. One issue arises when some
students select courses based on praxis, rath-
er than theory.
LSA Prof. Nesha Haniff teaches courses
in the Women's Studies and African and
Afroamerican Studies departments, such
as Pedagogy of Empowerment: Activism in
Race, Gender and Health, where students
teach an HIV education program to people
with low literacy skills that she developed to
various communities. "My courses are very
difficult," she said. "The practice component
does not happen without the academic com-
ponent."
Another issue is keeping the theory teth-
ered to the praxis. Out in the field or the com-
munity, the professor has limited control and
there can be a tendency for events to drift
from the curriculum's intent.
"The problem is when the material being
taught, or the reflection being conducted,
doesn't relate to the action being carried
out," Douglas said. "Then sometimes it just
becomes too much effort to make wide con-
nections, and that's where it's the profes-
sor's responsibility - you know, to make sure
that the action really ties in with what we're
learning and that the reflection really helps
solidify it to move forward.
Haniff noted that while service learning
opportunities provide outlets for experimen-

tal education, but when the necessary sup-
port and preparation isn't there, the work
becomes symbolic rather than meaningful.
"Praxis is becoming less and less relevant
and it's becoming more and more sort of sym-
bolic," Haniff said. "So students are delegat-
ed out to be in communities and places we're
supposed to do work, but the work is not nec-
essarily transformative. It's work that the
communities have to take responsibility for."
Haniff emphasized that students should
pay attention to the motivation behind taking
their theory/praxis courses, focusing on the
implications their studies will have on the
real-world communities they are entering:
"We have to find out for whom is our edu-
cation? Is it for yourself, or is it for the com-
munity? And how prepared are you to serve
the community?" Haniff said.
After all, experiential learning - within
the specific context of community work -
can still be quantifying rather than quantita-
tive and nuanced, as Haniff described.
"Even if you do work out in the field, the
purpose of it is to study and test and count
and measure. Not necessarily to intervene.
And so those issues become kind of mar-
ginal," Haniff said. "A lot of students are
yearning for application and yearning for
experiential education, but experiential edu-
cation is very tough and very rigorous. And
we don't have a curriculum that's very tough
and rigorous that's experiential."
The theory and praxis model is used large-
ly within The Residential College, which,
having developed the model of a small, qual-
ity liberal arts college against the backdrop
of the larger research University of which it
is a part of, pioneered this type of learning at
the University in the 1970s and remains at its
vanguard today.
"If you're an RC student you have a larger
possibility of getting involved in some mean-
ingful practice. But I don't think that's true
as a general rule for the rest of the Univer-
sity," Haniff said.
Douglas' favorite courses with practice
components have been within the RC or
at least cross-listed with it, such as On the

Margins of the Art World: Self Taught Art-
ists in the U.S., in the RC's Humanities, Art
History and American Culture departments.
The PCAP program and courses have recent-
ly moved under the RC from the English x
department.
"Honestly, it should have been moved
a long time ago," Douglas said. "It's just
because PCAP fits with the mission of the
Residential College - part of it is the learn-
ing in action and the other part is I think the
emphasis on social justice."
"I think in the RC, the professors genu-
inely want to see us take what we're learn-
ing and put it into action," Douglas added.
"They're not content to let us just sit and
write and essay; they want to see us engaging
creatively and intellectually with the mate-
rial and they want to see tangible results of
that."
Douglas noted that the RC provides a dif-
ferent kind of community space, where prac-
tice and theory are integrated.
Other departments have replicated the
RC's theory and praxis model and the focus
on engaged learning has been spreading over
the past decade, but in no way is pervasive
throughout the University.
"There's now a lot of research that show
that direct engagement (and) community
engagement increase the outcomes both of
academic performance and sense of satisfac-
tion with the University experience," Bright
said. "(But) it's not universal in the Univer-
sity, there's still plenty of faculty who don't
give a happy damn about anything that's out-
side of their office."
Though theory and praxis based learning
in the University is becoming more common,
the RC continues to be a leader in this type
of learning through its model of execution. -
Evans jokes that the RC likes to keep its alter-
native persona and have a leg up.
"There is definitely spreading this kind of
teaching and this kind of engagement across
a number of departments," Professor Evans
said. "We still aspire to be cutting edge
though. We'll probably come up with some-
thing new next year."
