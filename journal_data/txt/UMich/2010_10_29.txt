Daily StaffReporter
While students will be busy
today shopping for their last min-
ute costume items and planning
their Halloween weekend itiner-
ary, city officials and Greek life
representatives are also preparing

to make this festive weekend safer
than in previous years.
The Interfraternity Council on
campus is taking extra precau-
tions to ensure safety not only for
the Greek community but for all
of Ann Arbor, according to Kine-
siology senior Ryan Knapp, vice
president of public relations for
IFC.
Knapp said the organization is
working with the South Univer-
sity Neighborhood Association for
the first time to ensure safety in
the area. This collaboration will
serve as a way for IFC to branch
out into the greater Ann Arbor

community, he said. In the past,
communication between the IFC
and resident groups only occurred
after an incident took place.
"In that sense our interaction
has been very reactive," Knapp
said. "It's phenomenal for two
large organizations that have tra-
ditionally not communicated as
effectively as possible to sit down
and hash out problems and create
innovative solutions."
Robert Synder, president of the
South University Neighborhood
Association, said the collabora-
tion between the organization
and IFC will be beneficial and

shows the Greek community's
efforts to increase awareness of
neighborhood safety.
Snyder said the crowd at last
year's "Nightmare on Elm Street"
block party was "uncontrollable,"
and is something he wants to pre-
vent this year with the right safety
precautions. At the block party
last year, a 19-year-old man was
beaten by a group of 10 to 15 other
men after he tried driving down
the crowded street.

STANDING OUT AMONG THE COMPETITION

University's rating
* dropped to B, down
from B+ in 2010
By JOSEPH LICHTERMAN
Daily StaffReporter
The University received a B let-
ter grade in the 2011 College Sus-
tainability Report Card released
earlier this week, dropping down
from its B+ rating last year. But,
according to one University offi-

cial, the University's rating should
really be higher.
The Campus Sustainabil-
ity Report Card grades 332 col-
leges across the United States
and Canada in nine different but
equally weighted measures of sus-
tainability. Data for the report card
is collected via surveys that ask
questions about each institution's
campus operations, dining servic-
es, endowment investment prac-
tices and student activities. Each
question relates to sustainability.
Terry Alexander, executive

director of the Office of Campus
Sustainability, said the Univer-
sity's B grade was "disappointing,"
adding that he believes the report-
ing system is flawed and that the
University deserved an A.
Alexander said there are a num-
ber of reasons why the University's
grade was lower this year. He said
the main reason was because the
College Sustainability Report Card
never received a completed stu-
dent survey from the University,
which caused the grade for student

Eatery aims to jazz up vegetarian scene Wash. Post columnist highlights

New vegan
restaurant, Jazzy
Veggie, slated to hit
Main St. next month
ByANTHEA MITCHELL
For the Daily
Ananth Pullela says he's on a
mission to "change the perception
of vegetarian food."
Pullela's restaurant Jazzy Veg-

gie, located at 108 South Main St.,
is slated to join the ranks of other
vegetarian restaurants, like Seva
and Earthen Jar, when it opens
early next month. Pullela, said he
was motivated to open the vegan
eatery partially in part to remove
the stigma that vegetarian food is
boring and not flavorful or nutri-
tious.
"I wanted to change that ... by
offering some exciting flavors that
are traditionally limited to the
meat-based foods," Pullela said.
"Why can't we adapt those kinds

of flavors and make the food more
exciting and create some new ones
in the process?"
Pullela said he's been work-
ing with his chef to put together a
number of innovative dishes like
seasoned plantain chips with sig-
nature sauces and dips as well as
a selection of veggie burgers that
he insists will not taste like card-
board. The restaurant plans to
offer various types of condiments
that can add another layer of flavor
to the food like honey barbecue or

said.
This year's Nightmare on Elm
Street party is scheduled to take
place tomorrow night. According
to the Facebook event, more than
3,000 people are planning to attend
as of last night.
This year there will also be
increased police presence in areas
around town that typically have
large parties.
"There is nothing wrong with
being good neighbors and keep-
ing the commotion down," Synder
said. "It's common courtesy and
decency."
Many IFC fraternities are regis-
tered to hold parties this weekend,
according to Knapp. Therefore an
increase in safety awareness is
encouraged among all IFC mem-
bers, especially sober monitors who
are responsible for party safety, he
said.
"Because it is Halloween there
is more potential for things to get
out of hand," Knapp said. "It's very
important to make sure everything
is followed correctly to ensure
party safety."
One of IFC's main precautionary
focuses this weekend is helping out
with the safety at Saturday's Elm
Street block party since it affects
both Greek life members and the

Jazzy Veggie's food will be rich
in protein, Pullela said, to cater
to health conscious patrons. He
also described one additional item
he's particularly excited about - a
vegan cheese pizza that he calls
"guilt-free" because of its low cho-
lesterol and calorie content.
Ann Arbor resident Steve Brad-
ley, who's a waiter at a different
restaurant, said that while he's
not vegan or vegetarian, he thinks
Jazzy Veggie will be a welcome

scene.

Ann Arbor community as a whole.
Theta Chi, an IFC fraternity
located on the corner of South Uni-
versity and Washtenaw Avenue
near Elm Street, will be working
directly with AAPD.
LSA junior Michael Vaccarino,
president of Theta Chi, said a squad
car will be patrolling the fraterni-
ty's property every hour each night
this weekend, from 7 p.m. until 2
a.m. This new effort comes after
several incidents last year, includ-
ing broken windows, fights and the
hospitalization of a few Theta Chi
brothers due to various injuries,
Vaccaaino said.
Last year police took a long
time to show up at the scene and
the fraternity members had to call
five or six times before receiving a
response, Vaccarino said.
Once the police arrived, things
were returned to order but the
delay between the initial 9-1-1
call and the arrival of a squad car
is something IFC and Theta Chi
wanted to change this Halloween.
"If we can get the Ann Arbor
policeworkingwithus things won't
get out of hand and we won't be in
as much trouble," he said. "The
house parties are still going to go
on (on Elm Street). it will just be in
a much safer environment."
In addition to the police, Theta
Chi's executive council members
will also be staying around the
premises of the fraternity to ensure
no issues occur, Vaccarino said.

very ... few options," Bradley said.
Pullela said he knows what it's
like to have to hunt for vegetarian
food. When he moved to the United
States from India 17 years ago, Pul-
lela said vegetarian options were
hard to come by.
"At that time ... if I go to a typi-
cal fast food (place) I'd have to ask,
'OK, hold the meat, please hold the
meat, please hold this and that,' so
they put (on) a tomato and lettuce
and that's about it," Pullela said.
Though he admits that things
were different then, he said that
even now there are often only one
or two vegetarian options to choose
from on a menu, and these often
lack the creativity he plans to offer
at his restaurant.
Pullela said he first got the idea to
bring more vegetarian food to Ann

everything is under control and to

"The main concern when large
amounts of students congregate in
one area is that there is always a
risk for problems not only for the
students there, but for the people
living in the area as well, like exces-
sive noise, trash, destroying of
property and fights," Knapp said.
But Snyder said students who are
underage should still be cautious.
"If you're going to drink and
you're underage, stay out of sight
and don't be a part of the mob,"
Snyder said. "Don't stand around
outside where you can get tapped
by the police."
If someone is "visibly obnoxious"
and isn't standing on private prop-
erty, they should expect to be tick-
eted, Snyder added.
Yesterday afternoon Synder
showed Barnett Jones, the AAPD
chief of police, the "hot spots" of
the neighborhood. He said this
would allow the police depart-
ment to be present in these areas to
take necessary precautions before
incidents get out of control rather
than waiting for calls later in the
evening.
The increased police presence is
an opportunity for all the partygo-
ers to "act a little more adult and
still have a hell of a lot of fun," Sny-
der said.
Arbor while he was pursuing his
MBA at the Ross School of Business,
but he got serious aboutcopening the
restaurant in the last five years.
"The formal training in busi-
ness really helped me in putting
together my business plan," Pul-

Pullela is currently working
with contractors to change the
restaurant's faqade and interior
and has added tomato red and
lime green walls, which he said
he chose to make the restaurant
"vibrant and not dull."
Puella added thathe doesn't con-
sider other vegetarian restaurants
in the area competition because
he thinks patrons want a variety of
vegetarian foods.
"One day they'll go to Seva, and

E-mails were sent to all Greek
life members reminding them to
be safe this weekend, to be aware
of their surroundings and to not be
too out of control since there will be
increased police presence, Knapp
said. Additionally, the Michigan
Student Assembly, the Ann Arbor
Police Department and University
Health Service created information
packets that will be distributed to
all Greek life members reminding
them of the importance of main-
taining a safe atmosphere during
Halloween weekend. The packet
contains safety tips with the Uni-
versity's "stay in the blue" slogan
along with other safety recommen-
dations.
Laura Blake Jones, the Universi-
ty's dean of students, and a member
of the AAPD were also handing out
information sheets on Halloween
safety, along with candy and con-
doms, to students living off campus
yesterday.
"We're not trying to stop peo-
ple from going anywhere or hav-
ing a good time, we just want
more safety in large group set-
tings because once people gather
in large groups, group mentalities
set in," Knapp said. "We're trying
to avoid that."

between the two organizations
goes well this weekend, Knapp said
the IFC plans on working with the
neighborhood association more
often, rather than simply turning to
them when a problem arises.

Jeff Jackson, owner of Seva Res-

vegetarian restaurants in the area,
the better.
"I mean competition is competi-

I think the more people come down
and see you," Jackson said.
Rackham studentLeigh Gallagh-
er said she might visit Jazzy Veggie
simply for its interesting name, but
she did voice some concerns about
the food options the restaurant may
offer.
"Isn't veganism dated and
unhealthy?" Gallagher said.
Rackham student Michael Gor-
witz said that while he is notvegan,
he would be interested in visiting
an all-vegan restaurant like Jazzy
Veggie on occasion..

"Nobody from the student
side ever returned the survey,"
Alexander said. "So, what hap-
pens is the survey company then
goes to the websites and other
areas to gather information
because they can't get what they
want from the survey that was
never completed."
Alexander said the survey was
sent to the University last July,
but he doesn't know which stu-
dent group or individual failed
to return the survey.
"What we're trying to do is
try and figure out who they sent
the survey to because they sent
the survey out in July and most
students aren't around in July,"
Alexander said. "So the odds are
that nobody ever got the survey
to respond to."
According to lastyear's report,

sion filled out the 2010 survey.
of all institutions surveyed,
the average grade for student
involvement was a B. However,
44 percent of colleges and uni-
versities earned A's, according
to the report.
Alexander said many of the
efforts the University is imple-
menting to make its buildings
more environmentally friendly
- like green construction and
using campus buildings more
frequently - were not included
in the report card data. The Uni-
versity's grade in that category
remains a B.
The University's grade also
fell in the transportation, stu-
dent involvement and food and
recycling categories.
According to the survay data,

the University's fleet of auto-
mobiles decreased in size by
about 20 vehicles from 2010 to
2011, but the number of envi-
ronmentally-friendly vehicles
- including biodiesel, ethanol,
gas-electric hybrid and electric
vehicles - increased from 594
to 661.
When asked whether there
was a bicycle-sharing program
on campus in last year's survey,
the University mentioned the
East Quad Bike Cooperative, a
program that allows students
to borrow bikes. While the pro-
gram still exists, the University
responded that it doesn't have a
bicycle-sharing program when
asked the same question in the
2011 survey.
Also, when asked in the 2011
survey whether policies are in
place "that support a pedestrian-
friendly or bike-friendly cam-
pus," the University answered
no.
The University's average
grade for the transportation cat-
egory was a B, but 37 percent of
respondents earned an A.
Additionally, 55 percent of
all schools surveyed earned a
B-level grade for overall sustain-
ability, putting the University
on par with other institutions
across the nation.
Compared to other Big Ten
universities, the University of
Michigan tied with the Univer-
sity of Illinois at Urbana-Cham-
paign and Indiana University in
their sustainability grades.
However, the University of
Wisconsin-Madison and the
University of Minnesota earned
top marks in the Big Ten, fol-
lowed by Michigan State Uni-
versity, Ohio State University
and Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity.

Police: Abducted
Mich. girl's death

Authorities believe a man
accused of sexually assaulting a
15-year-old girl abducted the girl
from her home on the morning
she was to testify against him and
killed her later that day before kill-
ing himself.
Raymond R. Bush, 38, of New-

Instead, they say he abducted

investigating but have not found
any armed suspect so far.
A campus bus driver was on
his route around 4 p.m. when he
reported seeing an individual car-
rying a weapon, possibly a rifle,
near a building next to the student
union.
The university's emergency
notification system, called "Code
Maroon," sent texts and e-mail
telling students, faculty and staff
to remain indoors while police
searched for the suspected gun-
man.
JEMEZ PUEBLO, New Mexico
Trick-or-treating
* banned in tribal
community
The leaders of a Pueblo Indian
community in New Mexico have
banned trick-or-treating on tribal
* land, saying costumed children
on the streets this Halloween will
be sent home because the practice
runs counter to tribal culture.
Jemez Pueblo Gov. Joshua
Madalena also said a gruesome
killing last month involving two
young men has led the community
to realize it needs to stay in touch
with its youth.
He told The Associated Press
the Sept. 29 stabbing death of
tribal member Matthew Panana
affected the whole community,
although he also said he had been

discussing the trick-or-treat ban
with the Jemez Tribal Council,
public safety officials and pueblo
elders for months.
Federal investigators have said
* Panana was killed after knock-
ing continuously on the window
of Lucas Toledo's Jemez Pueblo
home.
MEXICO CITY
* Cartel violence
moves to capit01
Armed men rumbled into a gritty
neighborhood of the Mexican capi-
tal yesterday and gunned down six
men hanging around a convenience
store, fueling fears that one of the
world's largest cities is falling prey
to the cartel-style violence that has
long terrorized other parts of the
country.
More than 50 people have been
killed in the past week in five
apparently unrelated massacres,
including four shot yesterday near
the border city of Ciudad Juarez.
But the Mexico City shooting has
raised alarm among residents about
a drug war that has long seemed
distant.
"Massacres have arrived" in
Mexico City, El Universal news-
paper declared. But Mexico City
Attorney General Miguel Angel
Mancera said he did not know if
drug gangs were involved in the
middle-of-the night shooting in
Tepito, a working-class neighbor-
hood just north of the colonial
center.

automated phone survey of a ran-
dom sample of 300 voters across
Michigan's 15th congressional
district.
Betsy Barrett, communications
director for Dingell's campaign,
wrote in an e-mail interview
that the polling group has defini-
tive ties to the Republican Party.
She added that the Dingell cam-
paign's own polling has Dingell
up by double digits.
"This is a GOP poll conducted
by a firm with GOP ties masquer-
ading as an independent poll,"
Barrett wrote.
Steele, however, said he thinks
The Rossman Group poll's results
are accurate, and he doesn't think
the polling organizations have
any ties to the GOP. He said he
feels very good about his position
going into the last leg of the race.
"(Dingell's) approval rating is
not going up," Steele said. "My
approval rating over the four
polls has gone up significantly,
and my name recognition has
gone up significantly."
Josh Hovey, senior account
executive for The Rossman
Group, said the company's poll
produced accurate results and is
consistent with other polls.
"It's fairly reliable," Hovey
said. "Our polls on a statewide
level, at 16ast, have shown that
we've been within the margin of
error of every other major poll."
Adrienne Hansel, chief operat-
ingofficerofTeamTelCom,wrote
in an e-mail interview that the
results of the poll are accurate.
"Numbers from our statewide
automated polls that we have
conducted in the past eight weeks
are statistically in the margin of
error as all other publicly pub-
lished polls that use live callers
to gather the data," Hansel wrote.
Both Hovey and Hansel said
their firms don't have ties to any
political party.
"Ownership of our firm is bi-
partisan ... (and our) goal is to do
the best job of providing accu-
rate data to our clients," Han-
sel wrote. "We do work for both
Republicans and Democrats. Our
business gains nothing by favor-
ing one party over other."
But Mike Traugott, a commu-
nications studies professor at the
University, said the reliability of
the polling technique is question-
able.
"I have commented for some
time publicly about these com-
puterized polls, automatic dialer
polls," Traugott said. "I don't
think that they're very good
work."
Traugott said contributing
factors like low-response rates, a
non-representative sample or the
types of questions asked could all
introduce bias into the poll.
Vincent Hutchings, a politi-
cal science professor at the Uri-
versity, also said that automated
polls like these produce uncer-
tain results.
"I know there's a lot of con-
troversy about them," Hutchings
said. "People were somewhat
skeptical, at least experts are."
Hutchings added that even if
the poll was conducted correctly,
relying on only one poll could
result in an inaccurate prediction
for next Tuesday's election.
"Let's assume they're utiliz-
ing the gold standard in every

respect, it's still just one poll," he
said.
Despite the Dingell cam-
paign's own polling that shows
the incumbent congressmap is

ahead in the race, Dingell has
announced other federal fund-
ing for multiple projects in the
city and surrounding areas in the
lead-up to election days.
Dingell, together with local,
state and federal transportation
officials, announced $161 million
in federal dollars to fund a new
high-speed rail line in southeast
Michigan yesterday.
The U.S. Department of Trans-
portation funds will go toward
projects including the repair
of the AMTRAK line between
Detroit and Dearborn, the con-
struction of a West Detroit bridge
and tracks, and a planning analy-
sis of a track going from Detroit
to Chicago, according to a press
release issued by Dingell yes-
terday. These new transporta-
tion projects will spur economic
growth in the surrounding com-
munities and make the region
more competitive, according to
an e-mail statement from Adam
Benson, Dingell's press secretary.
And though this announce-
ment comes five days before the
Nov. 2 midterm election, Benson
wrote that the timing of yester-
day's announcement was not pur-
posefully scheduled for less than
a week before the congressional
race comes toa close.
"There is no relation," Benson
wrote. "Both the HSR announce-
ment and last week's $600 mil-
lion (Transportation Investment
Generating Economic Recovery)
grant announcements were ini-
tiated by fiscal year 2010 appro-
priations."
In recent press releases, Ding-
ell has highlighted various other
city projects that will employ
federal funds secured by Dingell.
These projects include $249 mil-
lion for A123 Systems - an Ann
Arbor-based battery technology
company - to expand operations
in Michigan's 15th district. Ding-
ell has also been a constant advo-
cate for the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act, making
sure these funds make their way
to Michigan and the 15th district.
Ann Arbor Mayor John Hieftje
said Dingell has consistently sup-
ported Ann Arbor throughout his
55 years in office and the deluge
of federally-funded projects isn't
specific to campaign season. City
projects like renovating bridges
and replacing Ann Arbor's old
buses with new hybrid models
have all been funded by federal
appropriations that were fought
for by Dingell, Hieftje said.
"He's helped us throughout the
years in myriad projects that has
involved federal funding," Hieftje
said.
Dingell recently lobbied for
a $1 million federal grant for
the Ann Arbor Transportation
Authority to rebuild the Blake
Transit Center.
Mary Stasiak, managerof com-
munity relations for AATA, said
the authority is grateful to have
Dingell's support for the city's
various undertakings.
"Congressman Dingell has
been a strong supporter of pub-
lic transportation," Stasiak said.
"This is reflected in his support
of appropriations to annual tran-
sit funding and most recently the
American Recovery and Rein-
vestment Act."
Conversely, a main focus of
Steele's campaign has been advo-
cating for curbing government
expenditures.

"The spending going on right
nowwill absolutely rob (students)
of any opportunity and (their)
job will basically be to supply
the government debt payments,"
Steele said.

The Pentagon City Metro station is seen in Arlington, Va., on Wednesday. Farooque Ahmed, 34, a naturalized citizen born in
Pakistan was arrested Wednesday and charged with planning to bomb subway stations around the nation's capital, the FBI said.
Oiicials: Muslim source
turned in terror suspect

Pakistani man
arrested for plotting
to bomb D.C. subway
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
tip that led to the FBI's subway
bombingstingcame from a source
in the Muslim community: A Pak-
istani-born man from a middle-
class suburb was trying to join a
terrorist group, law enforcement
officials said yesterday.
Farooque Ahmed, a natural-
ized cititen arrested Wednesday,
was a married father who had a
good job with a telecommunica-
tions company. Authorities say he
also was eager to kill Americans
in Afghanistan and committed to
becoming a martyr.
Ahmed thought he had found
what he wanted, a pair of al-Qaida
operatives who would help him
carry out an attack on the nation's
second-busiest subway, accord-
ing to court documents unsealed
yesterday. But the operatives were

really undercover investigators
whose meetings at a local hotel
room were all staged with the
FBI's cameras rolling, law enforce-
ment officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity because
the investigation continues.
What followed was an elaborate
ruse in which Ahmed was given
intelligence-gathering duties and
coded information in a Quran by
two individuals posing as al-Qaida
operatives as part of the supposed
plot to kill commuters.
Ahmed, 34, was taped discuss-
ing his firearm, martial arts and
knife skills and offering to teach
those deadly tactics to others,
according to an FBI affidavit.
Officials said they took guns and
ammunition out of Ahmed's sub-
urban Ashburn, Va., town house
during a search Wednesday.
Ahmed was arrested just
weeks before, the FBI says, he
planned to make the annual reli-
gious pilgrimage to the Islamic
holy city of Mecca in Saudi Ara-
bia. The case represents the lat-

est in a recent string of would-be
terrorist attacks that officials say
were aided, hatched or carried
out by U.S. citizens.
Like the accused gunman in
the deadly Fort Hood, Texas,
shooting and the convicted ter-
rorist who tried to detonate a car
bomb in New York City's Times
Square, officials said they believe
Ahmed was radicalized inside
the U.S. But they do not yet know
what sent him down that path.
Like many would-be terrorists
and sympathizers, Ahmed was
potentially influenced by Anwar
al-Awlaki, the radical Muslim
cleric who preached in north-
ern Virginia until 2002 and now
lives in hiding in Yemen, officials
said. But while Ahmed listened
to al-Awlaki's Internet sermons,
officials said the two were not in
contact and they're not sure how
influential those sermons were.
Ahmed's lawyer, federal pub-
lic defender Kenneth Troccoli,
declined to comment on the case
yesterday.

Cndtoipshnew sanctions on N. Korea

Sanctions a response
to sinking of South
Korean warship
TORONTO (AP) - Cana-
da's Conservative government
announced yesterday it was
drafting tough new sanctions
against North Korea in retalia--
tion for sinking a South Korean
warship earlier this year.
Foreign Affairs Minister Law-
rence Cannon said Canada is also
downgrading its already limited
diplomatic relations with the
nuclear state. He said the sanc-
tions will prohibit imports and
exports to North Korea, with
some humanitarian exceptions.
Earlier this year, Canada
announced stiffer restrictions
on trade, investment and other
bilateral relations with the com-
munist dictatorship and sus-
pended high-level visits by its

officials.
Those measures followed the
sinking of the Cheonan, a South
Korean navy ship, which killed
46 sailors.
Three experts from the Cana-
dian navy joined the multina-
tional team that investigated the
incident, and concluded the war-
ship was sunk by a North Korean
torpedo.
"They went out deliberately
and sank a South Korean ship
with a torpedo," Cannon said.
"We had three Canadian investi-
gators (who) determined beyond
any reasonable doubt that this
was an act of aggression and
therefore Canada is taking retal-
iatory measures."
Cannon said Canada's actions
are important because they are
based on a position of principle
- a common refrain from the
Harper government following its
historic failure to win a tempo-
rary seat on the United Nations

Security Council earlier this
month.
Cannon said Canada does not
want its action in any way to
be seen as targeting the North
Korean people, some of the poor-
est and most downtrodden in the
world.
North Korea has recently
reached out to its southern
neighbor, calling for talks on
the resumption of stalled tours
to a resort inside North Korea.
The two sides have also agreed
to hold the first reunions in a
year later this month for families
divided by the Korean War.
Canada joins a host of coun-
tries that have levied sanc-
tions against North Korea in an
attempt to persuade the commu-
nist country to curb its nuclear
ambitions.
Last year, North Korea quit
nuclear disarmament talks and
later tested an atomic device that
drew tightened U.N. sanctions.

identity, and how the two shape
the conversation surrounding
gender in politics.
Givhan, a University alum
originally from Detroit, has
become known for her weekly
column, in which she exam-
ines international fashion news,
trends and business. She won the
2006 Pulitzer Prize for criticism
and also recently published the
book "Michelle: Her First Year
as First Lady."
Though many view fashion
as an industry reserved for the
elite, Givhan noted that it's a
sector everyone participates in
every day.
"Itproduces clothes, and what
it sells are tools for self-defi-
nition and public expression,"
Givhan said. "Each of us, every
time we reach into our closet
and make a decision about what
we're going to wear on any given
day, we're participating in the
fashion industry."
Givhan spoke about her per-
sonal experiences and how
they've contributed to shaping
her writing. When she got to
Washington in 1995, she said she
realized that the capital city is
very concerned with fashion.
e"Washington is a city that

is consumed with how people
define themselves in the public
sphere," Givhan said.
Expressing her views on the
First Lady's choice of attire,
Givhan said Michelle Obama
achieves a balance of looking
both usual and extraordinary.
"I think at a certain point,
trying to relate to the American
public, trying to be average, goes
too far, and instead you start
looking common, banal, as if
you're no longer the First Lady
but instead somebody's neigh-
bor," Givhan said. "But she does
blend, I think, the pretty with
the powerful."
In addition to talking about
fashion, Givhan also discussed
the experience of returning to
Ann Arbor after years away.
"I was amazed at how differ-
ent it is, reminds me a lot of those
days when everything was really
new and I was still trying to fig-
ure out if I still wanted to be a
journalist," Givhan said. "It was
nice to come back and realize
that I made the right decision."
Givhan also gave some advice
for aspiring journalists. Despite
the industry's reportedly grim
outlook, Givhan remained posi-
tive on journalism's relevance in
society.
"There is always going to
be a market for good writers,"
Givhan said. 4

Hieftje for mayor
Incumbent has experience, progressive initiatives
t's easy for citizens to forget about city elections. But in the
shadow of the race for the governor's office, two Ann Arbor
residents are squaring off to be the city's mayor for the next
two years. Incumbent Mayor John Hieftje faces opposition from
challenger Steve Bean, an independent. The outcome of the race will
influence how the city approaches environmentally-friendly initia-
tives and improving public transit - things that students should care
about and will affect their everyday lives. Students must head to the
polls on Tuesday to cast their vote for Ann Arbor's next mayor.

Listen to be heard

Hieftje has been mayor for 10years. In that
time, he has served Ann Arbor well. Under
his supervision, Ann'Arbor has installed
LEDlights throughout the city; increased the
number of bike lanes and is in the process of
adding more; the city government now oper-
ates on20 percent renewable energy and the
city has won several awards for its environ-
mental programs. In 2007, he was appointed
to the Michigan Climate Action Council by
Gov. Jennifer Granholm. Hieftje plans to
continue to work with the University on con-
struction of the Fuller Road Transportation
Center, which he believes will one day serve
as a central hub for commuters moving both
within the city and across the state.
Steven Bean is the independent chal-
lenging Hieftje. He has served on a variety
of city commissions - he spent nine years
on the city's Energy Commission. He's also
served as the sustainability community
chair and is a member of the solid waste
committee and the transportation com-
mittee. He currently serves at the chair of
the Environmental Commission, of which
he's been a member since 2000. He aims to
increase the city's use of renewable ener-
gy. He argues that the city can be more
aggressive in its use of renewable energy.
He would like to educate the city on the
nuances of peak oil. Bean is also interested
in working with the Ann Arbor Transporta-
tion Authority to increase the frequency of
buses and how late the buses run.
In many ways, Hieftje and Bean are
much alike. Both candidates seem open
to increasing student involvement in city
government. They encourage students to
get involved with committees and commis-
sions. Hieftje, who also teaches at the Ford
School of Public Policy, has even appointed
some students to city committees.

Both candidates also place special empha-
sis on moving forward with the city's green
initiatives, and both haveyears of experience
in pushing for green initiatives. They'd both
like to continue to push DTE, the energy
company that owns many of the city's street-
lights, to install LED lights.
But Bean says that the city must make a
strong commitment to environmental ini-
tiatives. He argues that the approval of the
5-storey underground parking lot on South
Fifth Avenue wasn't compatible with the
city's supposed desire to decrease the num-
ber of cars in the city. And perhaps he's right.
But Hieftje's dedication to going green is not
in question: His years of pushing for green
initiatives and his success on so many of
them from bike lanes to lights to recycling
are evidence of his passion for environmen-
tally-friendly initiatives.
Aside from his work with green initiatives,
Bean seems to lack knowledge of what the
city can do to make Ann Arbor more appeal-
ing to young professionals. Hieftje, on the
other hand, wants to encourage more art
programs that will draw young profession-
als into the city. And he supports increasing
housing downtown that young people would
be interested in moving into.
Though Bean clearly has a passion for the
environment and there is a place for him in
city government, he lacks Hieftje's breadth
and depth of knowledge about city issues.
Hieftje seems more willing to work to create
a city culture that will draw in young pro-
fessionals. Hieftje is also more well-versed
in urban planning and supports housing
developments downtown that would offer
students more (and hopefully cheaper) hous-
ing options. Because of his experience and
proven progress on green initiatives, the
Daily endorses JOHN HIEFTJE for mayor.

nOct. 20, two members of the
Israeli Defense Force spoke
on campus about Israel's role
in the Middle East. This event was
sponsored by StandWithUs, an edu-
cational group that
works to "ensure
Israel's side of the
story is told..."
according to the
group's website. A
few minutes into
the presentation,
members of the
audience stood up
and removed their TYLER
jackets, revealing JONES
red t-shirts with
signs taped onto
their chests. On
these signs were names of dead Gazan
children, the date of their death and
the word "Silenced" underneath.
It is safe to say that at this point
the two IDF presenters recognized
the hostility in the audience. But
their presentation continued. After a
few minutes, the t-shirt-clad protes-
tors stood again and walked from the
room. As they moved to the door, one
of the soldiers requested the group
stay and ask questions. With the
exception of a few confused audience
members and the two IDF soldiers,
the room was left practically empty.
I suppose if the goal of the pro-
test was to draw shock and awe, the
demonstration was a success. But the
issues plaguing Arab-Israeli relations
today demand more serious action
than shock and awe. Dramatics will
not solve problems..If real progress is
to be made between Arabs and Israe-
lis, understanding must be a priority
- an ideal apparently lost on the Oct.
20 protestors.
These demonstrators marched out
of the IDF presentation to protest
Israel's actions during Operation Cast
Lead, a military offensive carried
out on December 27, 2008 to combat
rocket attacks from Hamas in Gaza.
According to Amnesty International,

about 1,400 Palestinians were killed
in the assault, as well as 14 Israelis.
Regardless of the side you support, it
is safe to say neither is truly innocent
in this conflict.
To bring light to the protest, a video
was taken of the event and uploaded
to the Internet. In the video, we see
a speaker facing a round of applause
at the end of the demonstration as he
commends the participants because
they "left the room empty," and sent
"a really big message." But both Arabs
and Israelis have lost children in this
conflict. Both sides have fallen asleep
to the sounds of exploding mortar
rounds. Homes are destroyed and
children die when opposing sides fail
to discuss and listen. This is no time
to send big messages with dramatic
walkouts - both Arabs and Israelis
have tried for too long to communicate
with high explosives and ammunition.
If there is one thing this conflict has
enough of it is big messages.
Ahmad Hasan, one of the student
protest coordinators, explained to
me in an e-mail interview that the
protestors "did not agree that mem-
bers of a military whose actions have
been so overwhelmingly condemned
by respected and reputable organi-
zations should even be welcomed on
our campus."
But if any substantial progress is to
be made regarding this deep-seated
conflict, dialogue is necessary. We
can't close the doors of campus to
those who hold a controversial view.
Until the two sides can acknowledge
differences, accept past errors and
work to achieve a common good,
there will be no peace. If we turn
away an individual or an organiza-
tion simply because they are in the
opposition, the conflict will remain
the same.
In the e-mail interview, Hasan
went on to explain, "For me to stay
and simply pose questions would
be dishonoring and unjust to the
silenced innocent who were, in the
end, never given the chance to ask a

single question."
I certainly empathize with the
protestors who only sought to do
what they thought was right. But this
issue is not about honoring the dead
or holding firm to past injustices. If
tomorrow one Palestinian child still
has to fear bombings or one Israeli
family must second-guess their trip
to the town market, the protest was a
failure. Society must stand to support
a cause in hope that tomorrow will
be better than today. Had the dem-
onstrators stayed, asked legitimate
questions and created a dialogue, per-
haps progress toward understanding
and resolution could have begun.
Understanding
is about Staying
in the room.

This is not about supporting Israel
or condemning the IDF - in the 62
years of Israel's existence, both sides
have accumulated blood on their
hands. More than sending a mes-
sage through dramatics or illustrat-
ing to the other side just how little
you value their views, enemies must
talk. Understanding is about staying
in the room, even if your opponent's
words make your blood boil and your
fists clench. It's about staying in your
seat and listening to what the other
side has to say.-Movements of activ-
ism are simply not enough to enact
change - protest accompanied by
plans of action, dialogue and discus-
sion is how we will save lives. What
the protestors need to understand is
that discussion - no matter how dif-
ficult - is the only way to give your
movement a voice.

Vote Hohnke, Derezinski

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS:
Aida Ali, Jordan Birnholtz, Adrianna Bojrab, Will Butler, Eaghan Davis, Michelle DeWitt,

long with a contested mayoral elec-
tion, voters in Ann Arbor will vote to
fill City Council seats on Nov. 2. The
City Council is made up of two representa-
tives from each of its five wards. The candi-
dates for Wards 1, 3 and 4 run unopposed.
The seats in Wards 2 and 5 are contested.
here are three candidates vying for
the Ward 5 seat: Independent New-
combe Clark, incumbent Democrat
Carsten Hohnke and Republican John Floyd.
Floyd is the only Republican in Ann
Arbor to throw his hat in the ring for this
year's city council election - and this isn't
his first campaign. The city is overwhelm-
ingly Democratic and City Council is
entirely comprised of Democrats. A Repub-
lican candidate offers a nice challenge to
the city's status quo.
But Floyd's views of students concerns
and Ann Arbor appear convoluted and out
of touch. It seems that Floyd would like to
freeze the city as it was half a century ago -
an Ann Arbor that doesn't serve today's stu-
dents' needs. He doesn't support downtown
housing developments. It seems he would
rather leave dealing with students exclu-
sively to the University. But students are a
huge economic contributor to this city, and
the city must consider their needs.
Clark, a 29-year-old real estate developer
who is currently pursuing an MBA from
the Ross School of Business, has solid and
specific proposals on increasing student
involvement in Ann Arbor policy-making
and student safety. A member of the city's
Downtown Development Authority, Clark
believes in making downtown an inexpen-
sive place for students and graduates to live.
In an effort to model the kind of commit-
ment the city and state should show to the
arts, Clark intends to donate his salary to
charities supporting the arts if he is elected.
Clark has promised to not seek re-election.
And while many of his ideas are promising,
it's uncertain if two years is enough to see
them to fruition.
Incumbent candidate Carsten Hohnke
is seeking re-election because of his desire
to serve his community. As the owner of a
local spa and fitness center, he has man-
agement and budgetary experience. In his
last term, he sat on the Greenbelt Advisory
Commission and worked to expand Ann
Arbor's recycling program and institute
single-stream recycling that has already
led to an increase in recycling. He also

favors downtown development to increase
the supply of student housing. He doesn't
have Clark's youth and idealism, but he
has shown that he can get things done,
and has goals to continue reducing how
much the city puts in landfills.
During his tenure as a councilmember,
Hohnke has produced results. And though
Clark is an idealist, it seems unlikely that
he could live up to Hohnke's reputation
of getting things done in only two years.
In Ward 5, the Daily endorses CARSTEN
HOHNKE.
his year's candidates for Ward 2 are
Democratic incumbent Tony Der-
ezinski and challenger Emily Sal-
vette, a Libertarian.
Salvette, the chair of the Libertarian
Party of Michigan, intends to focus on fiscal
responsibility. She doesn't favor increasing
taxes, and she has proposed paycuts for city
council members in the hopes of helping to
maintain the budget. She also recognizes
that the only way to decrease the cost of
rent around campus is to increase the sup-
ply of housing, and doesn't support height
caps that often place a stumbling block in
the way of development. Despite this, she
doesn't seem tuned in to what students need
and want - including a safe, well-lit city.
Derezinksi is probably the city's most
experienced council member. He's spent
years serving at various levels of govern-
ment, from a stint in the Michigan legisla-
ture to several years on the city council. In
order to find a way to balance the city bud-
get, he is interested in considering a city
income tax so that individuals who com-
mute to the city to work contribute to fund-
ing the services they use. He's specifically
interested in continuing the city's push for
more bike lanes. He'd also be open to re-
evaluating the current layout of the ward
system, which separates the student vote
and makes it difficult for students to make
their voices heard. Derezinski understands
that making the city accommodating to
developers is crucial to decrease the cost
of rent - though he supports what he calls
"reasonable" height caps.
After serving in the legislature and spe-
cializing in law practice for many years,
Derezinski has the experience necessary to
be successful. Derezinski's understandingof
Ann Arbor and students' needs is encourag-
ing, and Salvette just can't compete. In Ward

STUDENTS ALLIED FOR FREEDOM AND EQUALITY I
Silence speaks loudly

In an effort to contain growing outrage over Israel's overt
disregard of international law and human rights, the Israeli
military has launched a PR campaign that sends its former
soldiers to the U.S. to speak about their personal experienc-
es. Last Wednesday, Ann Arbor bore the dubious honor of
providing the platform for a military with a history of war
crimes to rationalize its actions.
At 4 p.m., students, faculty and community members
seated themselves in the room of the Michigan Union in
which the two Israeli soldiers would speak. At 4:05, when
the first soldier began his narrative, the room was full to
capacity. As the first soldier, Omer, started speaking, nearly
all of the event's attendees stood up, taped their mouths shut
and revealed red shirts bearing the names and ages of chil-
dren killed during the Gaza invasion. Omer continued giv-
ing his presentation to a sea of red-garbed, silent protestors
and went on to claim that Israel goes out of its way to avoid
targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure when engag-
ing in counter-terrorism. He spoke of how proud he was to
have served in an army with a moral code that preserves
human life. About 15 minutes into Omer's speech, the pro-
testors stood up in unison and filed out in silence. As they
walked out, two students held up signs that read: "We stand
today for those who have been silenced" and "Stand with us
against injustice and walk out on oppression." Several of the
remaining attendees also rose and left. By 4:20 the roomwas
nearly empty, with only about eight people still seated.
The events' attendees were protesting the presence of
representatives from Israel's military, called the Israel
Defense Forces, who are accused of war crimes by the Unit-
ed Nations and condemned by major human rights orga-
nizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights
Watch and Israel's own B'Tselem. Last year, Israel caused
outrage with its aerial bombardment and armed invasion of
the impoverished Gaza Strip in 22 days during December
2008 and January 2009, killing over 1,000 civilians includ-
ing more than 300 children. In the three-week war, Israel
destroyed nearly the entire civilian infrastructure in Gaza -
even attacking hospitals and ambulances - despite the fact
that medicalvehicles, personnel and buildings are protected
under international law. in addition, Israel's military shelled
the U.N. Relief Agency's compound in Gaza City, which
stored and distributed aid and medicine.
According to a U.N. fact-finding inquiry, the Gaza cam-
paign intended to destroy the civilian economic output of

the Strip and exacerbate the suffering of a populace that
has already endured by Israel. This siege continues to block
basic supplies from entering Gaza, and has brought the local
economy to a near standstill. The siege is condemned by
both the U.N. and leading international human rights orga-
nizations as illegal because it engages in collective punish-
ment and uses starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.
In May 2010, Israeli Special Forces stormed a humani-
tarian flotilla heading for Gaza while it was still in inter-
national waters. The flotilla was carrying aid including
medical and school supplies, aiming to break the siege of
Gaza and to bring the world's attention to the dispropor-
tionate suffering of Palestinian civilians. The flotilla was
crewed by over 600 activists from 37 nations, including a
Nobel Laureate and a Holocaust survivor. The Israeli mili-
tary went on to kill nine activists aboard the flotilla and
injure dozens more.
In an effort to contain the international fallout from
Israel's actions, the Israeli government has launched what
is essentially an international propaganda campaign. This
campaign attempts to shift attention away from recent
events by focusing on Israel's technological and biomedical
achievements, its humanitarian aid to other countries and
a framing of the attack on the flotilla and Gaza invasion in
terms of'self-defense.'
Ann Arbor was the latest stop in this rebranding cam-
paign. Moreover, the soldiers present on Wednesday
weren't merely representatives of a military that has
committed war crimes, they themselves could be traced
back to the violence. The organizing group StandWithUs
described the second soldier present on Wednesday, Shai,
as a member of the "elite Givati infantry brigade." This bri-
gade was investigated by the Israeli Military Police for an
airstrike during the Gaza invasion that targeted a civilian
home, killing 21 civilians - including some women and
children - and wounding 19 more.
On Wednesday, the silence spoke clearly: the justifica-
tion of atrocities will not be welcomed at Michigan. Simi-
larly, the international community's continued outrage
with Israel's government signifies the approach of a day
when the audience willing to listen to its self-exonerations
will also disappear.

Sayre on behalf of Students Allied for Freedom and Equality.

Michigan students make
it big in the background

A scream-inducing sequel

With state tax
incentives, it's easy
to be an extra
By EMILY BOUDREAU
Daily Arts Writer
Thanks largely to state film pro-
duction incentives passed in 2008,
the fabled 15 minutes of fame are
well within reach in Michigan. it's
now quite possible to experience
some watered-down Hollywood
glamour in the state as an extra in a
big-name movie.
The industry has been increas-
ingly active on the University of
Michigan campus and around
Ann Arbor. Many students have
seen the likes of Clive Owen or
Pierce Brosnan striding across the
Diag from a distance, and actually
working with them (well, standing
behind them) on film isn't nearly as
difficult as one might expect.
"Really, it's not that hard to
become an extra at all," said
Michelle Begnoche, communica-
tions adviser for the Michigan
Film Office. "It's really just a mat-
ter of showing up. Productions
post casting calls everywhere - on
Craigslist, industry websites. The
Michigan Film Office's website
puts them up as well. There's no
real science to it."
Some in the area have been sur-
prised at the ease with which they
made it onto the screen.
"I heard about being an extra
from some friends in Grosse Point,"
said LSA junior Chrissie Costakis.
"It was during the time they were
filming (Drew Barrymore's roller
derby movie) 'Whip It.' So I just
signed up with a registry online,
with my picture and my informa-
tion. That was -like two years ago.
Then finally, this summer, they
contacted me about being an extra
in (the latest Miley Cyrus movie)
'LOL: (Laughing out Loud).'"

Alex Fishman, a Michigan resi-
dent and student at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, stumbled into
being an extra in "Scream 4" in a
similar fashion.
"I'm a huge fan of Wes Craven
movies and I found a link on a web-
site I'd heard about and just regis-
tered. The movie people e-mailed
me and I showed up at six in the
morning. Mostly, I wanted to meet
celebrities, though. It wasn't about
a big acting break," Fishman said.
Others take their roles more seri-
ously. LSA senior Jesse Belanger,
who's been an extra twice now, has
been agent shopping and got head-
shots in the hopes of pursing act-
ing beyond extras parts, while LSA
sophomore Cynthia - Zhang has
been modeling since she was 16.
Zhang has been an extra in three
films. She gets notifications about
casting calls through her modeling
agency.
"I'm not expecting to get expo-
sure or anything by being an extra.
I just like to see how movies are
made, and that's kind of why I do
it. There are a lot of things that
you would just never really think
about," Zhang said.
Zhang was an extra in "This
Must Be the Place" with Sean Penn.
But apart from a brief exchange
with Penn, Zhang recalls, bizarrely
enough, a glass of orange soda most
vividly. She played a waitress.
"I watched a woman pour
orange soda into a glass over and
over and over, trying to get the
right volume and the right color,"
Zhang said.
A huge fuss was made over the
orange soda, but nobody seemed
to notice that Zhang, who had been
outfitted in a traditional Chinese
dress, was supposed to be Japa-
nese, she said.
"It's always the really small stuff
that you wouldn't think would
matter that actually does. I mean,
I really don't think I would notice
if a glass of orange soda wasn't the

right shade," Zhang said.
Fishman, Belanger, Costakis
and Zhang all had preconceived
notions of what it would be like to
be an extra. They felt they could
probably look at a movie scene
and tell you how it was made and
whether it would have been pain-
ful to film as an extra. Basically, it's
not glamorous work.
Costakis's role was in a club
scene in "LOL." She faked cheering
all day.
"We had to pantomime because
they didn't want any noise so I was
just kind of jumping around with
my mouth open and a silly expres-
sion on my face," Costakis said. "It
was exhausting."
Although she stood ten feet
away from Miley Cyrus, Costakis
didn't consider the proximity to be
one of the perks of the job.
Technically, extras aren't sup-
posed to talk to the stars. You speak
only when spoken to. Sometimes,
though, there is a bit of gray area in
which it's possible to have that shot
to talk the celebrities.
"As long as you're respect-
ful, I don't think it's a problem,"
Belanger said. "I was in this one
scene (in 'Scream 4') and between
takes, Neve Campbell was just sit-
ting.on a couch reading this philo-
sophical book about living and
dying. So you know, I asked her
about it. It seemed pretty interest-
ing."
According to Belanger, the expe-
rience is really what you make it.
"I never really spent time in the
little holding room. I went out and
watched them film," he said. "Once
I snuck up to the murder room,
which was pretty cool. It was all
bloody because somebody was sup-
posed to have been hacked on the
bed."
Sometimes, he said, it's best just
to sit back and listen.
"Eavesdrop. That's key. I mean,
you shouldn't do it in real life, but

Unfortunately for the Reys -
the protagonists of "Paranormal
Activity 2" - this is not the case. A
family as postmodern as the house
they live in, mom Kristi (television
stalwart Sprague Grayden, "24")
and company find themselves play-
ing unwilling hosts to a disruptive
supernatural guest. Their haunt-
ing is shared with the audience,
thanks to a security camera system
installed in the wake of a burglary
during which nothing was stolen.
Convenient for us. The first film
made it clear that demons hate it
when you videotape them; perhaps
the demon staged the break-in to
give itself a head start.
Like every dumb family since
"Poltergeist," the Reys refuse
to leave. They don't express any
unease at leaving each other alone
in the house for extended periods
of time, and they don't take the pro-
active step of contacting Southern
California's foremost demonologist,
as the first film's protagonists did.
But these aren't quarrels to be dis-
sected frame by frame in SAC 236;
they are tobe shouted at the screen,
in a rousing chorus with the rest of

A film with' Conviction'

EXTRAS
From Page 5
you can learn a lot, like where to go
to find a good agent, places to avoid,
what to wear. A lot of your ques-
tions can be answered that way."
Eventhough wandering through
a murder house sounds fun, an
extra's job is still quite difficult.
The hours are long and the pay isn't
always great, depending on the role.
As an extra in a large scene, Fish-
man and Costakis made minimum
wage. Zheng and Belanger, who had
more specific roles, got paid slightly
more. According to Belanger, the
stand-ins for the actors make the
most, but no one does it solely for
the money.
"One gentleman I spoke to
recently (is an extra) as a hobby.
Others think of it differently. All
kinds of people are extras. People
are making careers out of this - it's
a way to generate income," Beg-
noche said.
But sometimes the income is all
extras get for their time, as their
15 minutes of fame are expendable
as far as the filmmakers are con-
cerned.
"As an extra, you're in the back-
ground so there's a chance that you
won't make the cut and see your
scene in the final production," Beg-
noche said.
All the money, time, effort and
the cans of orange soda can seem a
little over-the-top and perhaps a bit
wasteful. Yet Begnoche maintains
that a lot of the money is going back
into the Michigan communities the
movies are made in. In 2008, there
were 35 productions that gener-
ated $125 million, according to the
Michigan Film Office. This year,
the Michigan Film Office expects
more than $300 million to come
from the budding film industry.
"Overall, the reactions have been
very positive. It's exciting. Commu-

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

nities are really very eager to have
(these films made) in the area,"
Begnoche said.
Zhang's family owns a Chinese
restaurant called Kim's in Tiny,
Michigan. Incidentally, Kim's was
chosen as a filming location for part
of the new "Harold and Kumar"
movie.
"It was a huge deal," Zhang said.
There was a sprawl of 20 to 30trail-
ers in the parking lot and a massive
crowd of people for two full days.
Zhang's father even got to be an
extra in the film. The movie only
spent two days filming in Troy, but
it definitely left an impression.
"I think people (are looking for-
ward) to being able to point and
say 'I was there, that's my home,'"
Zhang said.
The extras have built up their
own community as well.
"Oh, there are definitely extras
cliques," Belanger said. "There's a
lot of people who have been doing
this for a long time, then there are
the people who are new to it. And
there's a lot of jealousy of people
having done more than you. 'How
many movies have you been in?'
was something everybody was
always asking."
While acting's a competitive
business, there is something about
being an extra that draws people in.
For some, the experience of being
an extra is a wake-up call that act-
ing might not be their preferred
profession.
"I'd never want to be an actress
(after being an extra). It's too repet-
itive. If you do an awkward scene
like a make-out scene you'd have to
keep doing it like 20 times," Costa-
kis said.
But others absolutely love it.
Belanger would drive through the
middle of the night in the pitch
black, only to arrive on a set that
was lit up to look like the after-
noon. "It's so real, but so fake," said
Belanger, and that's what makes it
interesting.

'Marmalade' mixes cocaine and cacti

0l

Basement Arts uses
its imagination to
find a violent friend
By BRAD SANDERS
Daily Arts Writer
Normally, four-year-olds
don't have cocaine-using, vio-
lent friends.
Then there's Mr. Marmalade
Lucy.
In "Mr. Tonight at 7 p.m.
Marma- and 11p.m.,
lade," the tomorrow at 7 p.m.
first Base- Waigreer Drama Center,
ment Arts Studio One
show of the Free
season, the
wild ele-
ments of a child's imagination are
revealed. Lucy, played by Shannon
Eagen, a junior in the School of
Music, Theatre & Dance, fabricates
a friend named Mr. Marmalade, a
troubled businessman played by
MT&D senior Joey Richter.
The play, by Noah Haidle, is set
in a New Jersey living room that
incorporates fantastical elements
like sunflowers and cacti por-
trayed by actors. Instead of play-
ing with her toys lying on the floor,
Lucy uses her mind as a dangerous
playground.
"This show is really about the
imagination and that means the
audience needs to have one as
well," said MT&D sophomore Oliv-
ia Lloyd, the show's director. "It's
a dark comedy, but really what it's
about is growing up and how little
kids are sponges and can pick up
anything that the world throws at
them."
Lloyd weighed in on one scene

"Mr. Marmalade" explores the exploited imagination of a four-year-old

in particular, in which a drunk and
drugged Mr. Marmalade comes
home and assaults Lucy.
"It's one of those things where
it becomes our decision of whether
this is something that Lucy actu-
ally witnessed because she has a
crappy mom," Lloyd said, "or the
TV is always on and you put SVU
("Law & Order") on for too long
and a kid regurgitates it back to
you."
Lloyd saw an early production
of "Mr. Marmalade" with her dad
in her hometown, Shepherdstown,
West Virginia, at age 13. She said
the play inspired her to work
toward becoming a director.
"Seeing it with my dad was an
interesting experience because
it gets kind of raunchy at points
- not raunchy, but it gets kind of
edgy, and it was hard to watch with
a parent at age 13," Lloyd said. "It
was one of the first shows I was

looking at and saying,'Man I would
like to be a director. This would be
a really fun thing to direct."'
For Lloyd, an LSA transfer,
Basement Arts presented the per-
fect opportunity to showcase her
directing abilities for the first time
with aplay she loves.
"I know Basement Arts likes
to do edgy shows. They are very
well known for doing shows that
are an unconventional sort of the-
ater," Lloyd said. "I proposed a
show because I knew the best way
to learn how to do something is to
just do it ... it has ended up working
out so far."
For the nostalgic, the music
of "Mr. Marmalade" comes from
memorable television programs
from the early'90s, as well as more
contemporary children shows.
"I'm using a lot of music from
kids shows, both from our genera-
tion of childhood shows and the

current," Lloyd explained. " 'Yo
Gabba Gabba!' is actually some
kind of freaky psychedelic stuff
and I love it. ... It's being used a lot
in this show."
"Mr. Marmalade" has some
heavy themes and analyzes com-
plex human relationships. But its
director hopes people can find
ways to take it lightly.
"We sometimes forget about
how childhood can be so innocent
and playful," Lloyd said. "It's not
a terribly serious show - it really
isn't. This show is all about hav-
ing a lot of fun and laughing about
things that maybe you shouldn't
laugh at."
For the late Friday showing of
"Mr. Marmalade" especially, the
cast and crew want the audience
involved in that sense of humor
and playfulness: Everyone is
encouraged to dress in Halloween
costumes.

Big Ten coaches praise Beilein

By ZAK PYZIK
Daily Sports Writer
CHICAGO - It was no secret
at Big Ten basketball media day
that Michigan is expected to be at
the bottom of the pack. Coaches
and players from
opposing teams NOTEBOOK
said time and
time again that the Wolverines are
rebuilding. Even Michigan coach
John Beilein acknowledged that
the Wolverines have easily the
youngest roster in the conference.
Everybody gets it - the team has
an uphill battle from here on out.
But when Indiana coach Tom
Crean finished his opening state-
ment at the coaches press confer-
ence, something caught the ear of
the Michigan media in the room.
"There might be some prepara-
tions that are as hard," Crean said.
"But there are none harder than
getting ready for a John Beilein-
coached team."
While many coaches made
references to the game's unpre-
dictability - that any team could
beat any other on any given night
- it is also clear that Michigan's
unknown weapons in conjunction
with Beilein's complex scheme may
challenge better Big Ten teams.
Beilein primarily ran a 1-3-1
defense last year. But after offens-
es picked it apart, the Wolverines
instituted man coverage. Beilein
finished the season by switching
between the two.
"I don't know why they think
its difficult to coach against me; I
don't know anything else," Beilein
said. "Certainlylastyear therewere
many games it wasn't difficult to
coach against us. I think if we can
get open shots and knock them
down it's going to change our whole
look. And our defense, unlike last
year, will have to be consistent."
This year, Beilein mentioned
that he is going to attempt the 1-3-1
again. With that, Michigan intends
to use the fast break much more
effectively. Essentially, Beilein's
aggressive defense will have to
convert more turnovers into points
to compete with other Big Ten
schools - something it couldn't do
last year.
INJURY PLAGUED: Arguably
the biggest preseason headline
has been Purdue forward Robbie

Several Big Ten coaches noted the difficulty of preparing for teams coached by Michigan coach John Bellein (pic
2009) during the Big Ten conference at Big Ten basketball media day on Thursday.

Hummel's season-endingACL tear.
The senior participated in about
three team practices and 10 indi-
vidual workouts before Boilermak-
er coach Matt Painter knew that
Hummel had to call it quits.
Purdue was ranked first in the
conference by multiple media
outlets prior to Hummel's injury.
But as soon as news came out that
Hummel was done, Michigan State
became the definitive leader, and
Ohio State was the popular number
two.
The Boilermakers lost Hummel
for the season with the same injury
last February.
"For us, we have some experi-
ence of going through this," Painter
said. "It stinks ... it's like Ground-
hog's Day for us. But we have been
through this with not having him
or not having him 100 percent.
And we've been able to make some
adjustments. We've had some
bumps in the road, and I think
we've learned from that."
Michigan State's Kalin Lucas is
facing similar issues as star point
guard missed the entire offseason.
The senior ruptured his Achilles
tendon in March and was sidelined
for five months.

"Players are made inthesummer
and teams are made in the win-
ter," Spartan coach Tom Izzo said.
"But we had about five players that
didn't make themselves any better
in the summer. But in Kalin's case I
think (he) became a little better by
injury. Now he doesn't rely just on
speed, he relies on his knowledge of
the game ... If he gets that all back
we're going to have a better player.
"I'm very nervous," Izzo said
about the high expectations for his
team after Lucas's injury. "We're
not going to be as good of a team
until the middle of December ...
Because we are going to have some
(setbacks). How do you handle
that?"
Indiana guard Maurice Creek
showed up to Chicago with a knee
brace on. He fractured his left knee
in late Dec. 2009. Before the injury,
Creek averaged 16.5 points a game
and completed about 45-percent of
his 3-pointers.
Iowa guard Matt Gatens tore a
tendon in his left hand.
"Matt's having surgery today,"
Hawkeye coach Fran McCaffery
said yesterday. "You're probably
looking at three weeks before he
can play."

PRESEASON PRESENTS: Lucas
received Preseason Big Ten Play-
er of the Year honors, which was
actually a surprise to him.
"It is really a shock, to be hon-
est," Lucas said. "I had no clue I
was going to get it because of my
injury. At the same time, I know
I will work hard every day and I
will live up to it. At the same time,
it could have been my teammates."
Illinois's Demetri McCamey,
Purdue's JaJuan Johnson and
OE'Twaun Moore and Wisconsin's
Jon Leuer joined Lucas as the Pre-
season All-Conference team.
Michigan State, Ohio State and
Purdue gathered the Nos. 1, 2 and
3 in preseason rankings, respec-
tively. Although those three teams
seem like the dominant forces, any
team could pull away with the Big
Ten title at the end of the season,"
Izzo said.
"When you've got a Wiscon-
sin or a Minnesota that are put in
the middle of our pack right now
- that's scary," he said. "Because
they're good. They're well coached
and good. Those guys have done it
all the time ... we're up to six, seven
or eight (teams) that are really
good."

Blue has reason to be optimistic
for key matchup in Happy Valley

Historic goal a
'trademark' of
freshman star
Soony Saad
By MICHAEL WELCH
Daily Sports Writer
In the 14th minute of the Michigan
men's soccer tam's 5-1 victory over Bowl-
ing Green Wednesday night, freshman
forward Soony Saad scored a rare and
incredible goal, launching a ball 67 yards
from midfield into the net.
But for Saad, it was typical enough.
"People say that's my trademark, to
score it from my own half, because I did it
in high school a lot and I also did it in club
ball," Saad said.
Saad's 67-yard goal from behind mid-
field was the longest goal in Mjchigan
men's soccer (9-4-3) history.
"I always keep tabs on the goalie at the
start of the game," Saad said. "I usuallylike
to see if he's out to chip it."
For miost forwards, it's normal to
attempt to chip a goalie from outside of
the box when the goalie is creeping too far
away frtm hts goal. Saad's awareness of the
Falcon goaltender Migael Rosales's poor
positioningextended past midfield though,
as Saad got the ball around midfield on a
loose ball and quickly decided to shoot.
"It wasn't really a shot, it was more of a
long ball," Saad said. "But it is pretty diffi-
cult with the wind and especially from that
distance, whether to hit it straight or to put
curve to3 it."
After making all the necessary judg-
ments, Saad's strike was perfectly placed.
Rosales attempted to tip the ball, but
instead watched as the ball landed in the
back of his net. Burns explained that Bowl-
ing Green's mistake came in not preparing
for a player who can typically make that
long of a goal.
"It's probably more of a scouting report
rsistake than anything," Burns said. "They
should've known that when Soony gets the
ball, he might shoot from anywhere, even
in his own half."
Since Bowling Green (5-7-2) had been
attacking, the defenders were pushed up the
field atad the goalie naturally had to move
tp with them to maintain communication.
When Saad got the ball in that position, the
goalie was in no-man's land and there was
nothing he could do to stop the shot.
"Goalies tend to stay connected to their
backs," Burns explained of the goalie's
positioning. "When play's up in the 18-yard
box, your goalie is automatically going to
be out."
In the end, making a goal like that comes
down to Saad's skill and awareness and the
other team's inability to plan for that situ-
ation.
It really is a goal that nobody saw or will
see coming.

Jokes aside, Rodriguez
spent much of this past week praising Pater-
no and his longevity. Paterno has coached
the Nittany Lions since 1966, and he holds
the PBS record for wins as a head coach.
"What he and (former Florida State
coach) Bobby Bowden have done, I don't
think that'll ever be matched," Rodriguez
said. "Not because somebody's not smart
enough or good enough to do that ... but to
do it for that long at the same school with
that much success, it's extremely rare."
But Rodriguez's respect will take a
backseat on Saturday in State College.
Rodriguez knows this matchup is critical,
particularly since Michigan (1-2 Big Ten,
5-2 overall) is coming off a bye week after
two Big Ten losses that knocked the Wol-
verines out of the Top 25.
Rodriguez said his players haven't treat-
ed Saturday's game any differently from
the first seven of the season.
"We're going to try as hard as we can
every time we play a game - every time,"
he said. "It's not like, 'OK, boy this is an
important game, you're really going to
coach harder or play harder this week.' Are

you kidding me? They're keeping score."
A few things will be working in Michi-
gan's favor heading into Saturday's game.
The first is Penn State's quarterback
situation. True freshman Rob Bolden, who
had started every game this season for the
Nittany Lions (1-2 Big Ten, 4-3 overall), left
last week's game with a concussion.
Paterno said he would "go with Mac" on
his radio show last night, meaning after a
week of uncertainty, he would start former
walk-on Matt McGloin on Saturday.
"I don't think they'll change much what
they do in regards to who the quarterback
is," Rodriguez said. "I think their offense
will stay pretty much the same."
Still, a new quarterback in his first career
start might be just what the Michigan
defense needs. The Wolverines rank 104th
out of 120 FBS teams in yards allowed per
game (441.0 average).

Meanwhile, on the other side of the ball,
Michigan sophomore quarterback Denard
Robinson has struggled in the past two
games, battling both shoulder and knee
injuries. But two weeks off could help a
rejuvenated Robinson have a big game
against the Nittany Lions.
Penn State has had an interesting
approach to the question plaguing Michi-
gan's opponents this season - How do you
prepare for Robinson?
"They let him wear a wig with some
dreads on it," Penn State linebacker
Michael Mauti said Wednesday during the
weekly Big Ten a teleconference.
It remains to be seen whether the visual
will help the Nittany Lions against Robin-
son, who leads the nation in rushing, with
1,096 yards on the season, and is second in
total offense (345 yards) yards per game.
Along with Robinson, Michigan expects a

few other banged-up players,like center David
Molk and defensive lineman Mike Martin, to
return healthier Saturday after the bye.
There's one more waiting period left,
though. Saturday's game is an 8 p.m. kick-
off, the latest start Michigan has had all
season. Rodriguez isn't concerned since he
and his coaching staff have experience pre-
paring players for a night game.
"We'll keep 'em pretty busy," he said.
"You don't want to just lay around all day in
your room. We'll have a walk through and
usually the position coaches will take their
guys and go for a walk."
He insisted they wouldn't be going "any-
where in public."
"It's not like we're going down there and
tailgating. We're not going to do that. I've
been there before a few times. They'll tail-
gate with the best of'em."gate with the best

Breakdown: M' takes on depleted Lions

By RYAN KARTJE
Daily Sports Editor
This Halloween weekend, both Michi-
gan and Penn State may have a lot to be
scared of when they meet in Happy Val-
ley on Saturday.
After all, the Wolverines are coming
off two straight conference losses and are
going into one of the most hostile envi-
ronments in the Big Ten. Oh, and it's an
8 p.m. kickoff.
The Nittany Lions, on the other hand,
are giving backup quarterback Matt
McGloin his first start ever with usual
starter Rob Bolden dinged up. Not to
mention, their defense is one of the most
injury-depleted in the country.
So anythingcan happen on Saturday in
a game sure to have a whole lot of tricks
and treats.
MICHIGAN PASS OFFENSE VS. PENN
STATE PASS DEFENSE
Sophomore quarterback Denard Rob-
inson said he's 100 percent for this week-
end's matchup, and after accounting for
more than his fair share of turnovers in
the last two games, the Wolverines are
hoping that Robinson will bounce back in
what should be his most important start to
date.
Sophomore Tate Forcier stepped up in
Robinson's absence last week, lighting up
the Hawkeye defense for 239 yards and a
touchdown, and Robinson was doing a sat-
isfactory job before he hurt his shoulder.
The Nittany Lion front seven is hurting,

and the pass rush shouldn't be too much
for the Michigan offensive line. That
means Robinson should have plenty of
time in the pocket.
He's been pressing lately though, and
Penn State is still capable of making turn-
overs. So if he forces anything, the Wol-
verines could be looking at a few more
picks. But after the bye, Robinson should
become Robinson again, and that means
big things for Michigan's pass offense.
EDGE: Michigan
MICHIGAN RUSH OFFENSE VS. PENN
STATE RUSH DEFENSE
For the first time in more than a month,
the Michigan rushing attack should be
back to normal. Iowa and Michigan State
both have very capable run defenses, so
in Penn State, the Wolverines may finally
have an opponent they can run all over
again. That's mostly due to the Nittany
Lions' wealth of injuries.
Sophomore Vincent Smith started to
look pretty good last week, and junior
Mike Shaw should finally be 100 percent.
But the running back position, as a whole,
should remain a question mark as usual.
The quarterback position though,
should be as strong as ever running the
ball, as Robinson has a great chance of
running past the entire 11-man defense.
If the run game doesn't work in Happy
Valley, it may not work again this season.
EDGE: Michigan
PENN STATE PASS OFFENSE VS.
MICHIGAN PASS DEFENSE

Yikes - talk about scary. The Nittany
Lions are starting a brand-new quarter-
back ina primetime game. The Wolverines
have one of the most frighteningly anemic
pass defenses in the NCAA.
This matchup should be interesting to
say the least. McGloin is a former walk-on
who has impressed some of the Penn State
coaches, but not enoughtobeatout Bolden,
who's been moderate at best. The Michi-
gan secondary, meanwhile, hasn't shown
many signs of improvement; although, the
Wolverines should start showing some
promise soon, right?
Then again, freshman corners Cullen
Christian, Courtney Avery and Terrence
Talbott are bound to show something
soon. But with a fairly talented corps
of skill players around McGloin, today
doesn't seem like the day.
EDGE: Penn State
PENN STATE RUSH OFFENSE VS.
MICHIGAN RUSH DEFENSE
Michigan's rush defense has been
mediocre all season long, and Penn State,
despite underachieving all year, has a
very talented group in the backfield. Evan
Royster and Stephfon Green make for an
incredibly dynamic 1-2 punch, one that the
Wolverines may not be able to stop.
Michigan has had all kinds of trouble
with Royster in the past. But this season,
Royster hasn't really looked like the same
running back as he had in past seasons,
the one with the coolest following in the
NCAA (The Blue Royster Cult).
The Nittany Lions also lost a running

threat with Bolden out, and McGloin
isn't much on the ground. Then again, we
haven't really seen him run. So much of
this category will depend on Royster liv-
ing up to potential.

SPECIAL TEAMS
Again, not many more developments
on this part of the Wolverines'game. Seth
Broekhuizen showed that he's still not
very polished when it comes to kicking
field goals - getting one blocked against
the Hawkeyes.
This one, like it may be all season, goes
to whoever is opposite Michigan.
EDGE: Penn State
INTANGIBLES
Man, this game screams intangibles.
With the late kickoff State College should
be primed and ready to show why it's one
of the hardest places to play inthe country.
Also, not to be underplayed, the Hal-
loween effect should make Happy Valley
a spectacle, with zombies filling Zombie
Nation. Who knows what will happen
with the young Wolverines with a whole
band of zombie college students scream-
ing their heads off at them.
The bye week will help, but all the
intangible factors seem to be pointing in
the direction of a frightening home crowd
on All Hallow's Eve.
