At last night's Michigan Stu-

new resolutions and addressed

six resolutions that were pro-

One of the proposals was an
ongoing resolution to change the
MSA's Compiled Code to require
the MSA treasurer to prepare and
submit a semester-end financial
status report to the assembly. The
new resolutions included sup-
porting the creation of a student
organization panel during New

ria for MSA's budget.
During the discussion of the
resolution to amend MSA's Com-

Anti-abortion group
video targets Va. clinic

Planned Parenthood
criticized for giving
advice to pimp and
prostitute couple
RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - An
anti-abortion group that has
targeted Planned Parenthood
released a secretly recorded video
yesterday that purports to show
a couple posing as a pimp and a
prostitute receiving abortion and
contraceptive counseling at a Vir-
ginia clinic for their underage sex
workers.
The group, Live Action, said
the video illustrates Planned Par-
enthood's "willingness to aid and
abet in the sexual exploitation of
minors and young women."
The shaky video and its
soundtrack has been given to
law enforcement officials, Live
Action said, and it has asked
anti-abortion state Attorney
General Ken Cuccinelli to inves-

tigate "these heinous practices."
Cuccinelli's office did not
immediately respond to a request
for comment from The Associ-
ated Press.
Gov. Bob McDonnell was
"deeply troubled" by the video
and urged an investigation by
local police, a spokesman said.
"The apparent actions of the
clinic employee, if accurate, are
alarming," Tucker Martin wrote
in an e-mail to The Associated
Press.
Planned Parenthood Fed-
eration of America defended the
Richmond clinic staff member
for her professionalism in deal-
ing with "a highly unusual person
posing as a patient."
After the visit the staff member
notified her supervisor, who alert-
ed Planned Parenthood's national
security team, the federation said
in a statement. The organization
said it is working with the FBI on
the clinic visits. The Richmond
visit was one of four reported in
Virginia, Planned Parenthood

said.
The Richmond film record-
ed Jan. 12 is similar to a video
taken by Live Action on Jan. 13
at a Planned Parenthood clinic in
Perth Amboy, N.J.
Following release of the New
Jersey videotape, Planned Par-
enthood said it also had promptly
notified law enforcement authori-
ties after the visit, but fired the
clinic employee for violating some
of the organization's policies.
In the Richmond video, a clinic
worker talks primarily with the
man while the woman apparently
secretly videotapes the counsel-
ing. They talk about access to
abortions, birth control and test-
ing of sexually transmitted dis-
eases for prostitutes described as
14 and 15 and either from out of
state or another country.
At one point, the clinic work-
er discusses an abortion for an
underage girl using what she
calls a "judicial bypass" so the
procedure can be done confi-
dentially and without a legal
guardian.
The worker advises the pair
an abortion can be cloaked
from a parent and adds, "We're
pretty good at handling if
someone doesn't want someone
else to know."
Live Action's president, Lila
Rose, said the videos illustrate
Planned Parenthood's willing-
ness to "circumvent parental
consent laws for secret abor-
tions."
National anti-abortion
groups have used the earlier
released video to intensify
their calls for federal legisla-
tion to cut off the more than
$350 million in annual fed-
eral family planning fund that
Planned Parenthood receives.
Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., has
introduced the legislation.
In Virginia, anti-abortion
activists and social conserva-
tives said the videos illustrate
what they said is Planned Par-
enthood's disregard of laws
intended to regulate abortion.

Prosecutors allege
prime minister
paid for sex with
a minor
ROME (AP) - Italy's parlia-
ment backed Premier Silvio Ber-
lusconi yesterday, rebuffing a
request by prosecutors to search
some of his properties as part of
a prostitution investigation tar-
geting him.
In a much-needed victory for
the embattled leader, parlia-
ment rejected the prosecution
requests in a 315-298 vote that
came after a four-hour debate
in the lower house. They sent
the case back to the prosecutors,
challenging their jurisdiction.
The premier has denied wrong-
doing.
Milan prosecutors allege that
Berlusconi paid for sex with a
minor and then used his office
to cover it up. They wanted to
search the offices of a Berlusconi
accountant, Giuseppe Spinelli,
who allegedly handled payments
on behalf of the premier to the
A

minor as well as other payments
to a number of young women
who attended parties at his vil-
las.
The vote will likely have lim-
ited impact on the investigation.
Magistrates are planning to go
ahead with their probe and are
expected to issue a request to
indict Berlusconi as early as next
week.
But yesterday's vote was a
significant victory in a test of
Berlusconi's grip on parliament.
The premier's once comfortable
parliamentary majority became
shaky after he fell out with an
ally last year, and he barely sur-
vived a pair of confidence votes
in December.
"The vote assures the majority
that it still has the numbers to go
ahead, however narrowly," said
Francesco Verderami, a political
analyst for Corriere della Sera.
"As far as the judicial battle
is concerned, nothing changes,"
he said. "Politically it is step for-
ward for Berlusconi."
Making the vote even more
sensitive, Berlusconi had already
suffered a setback earlier yes-
terday when a parliamentary

commission deadlocked a gov-
ernment plan to grant Italy's
towns and cities a greater role in
taxation.
Enacting sweeping reforms to
grant more powers to local gov-
ernments and more autonomy
from Rome is the top priority of
the Northern League, a crucial
Berlusconi ally, and any delay or
failure to pass the measure might
affect the government's stability.
In a move aimed at sidestepping
the parliamentary setback and
appeasing the League, Berlus-
coni held an emergency Cabinet
meeting late yesterday to push
ahead with some of the same
measures by way of government
decree.
Berlusconi, 74, has rejected
calls for his resignation in the
wake of the sex scandal, which
has come to be known in Italy
as "Ruby-gate," in reference to
the nickname of the Moroccan
teenager at the center of the
probe. The scandal has proven
an embarrassment for Italy, with
newspapers describing parties
at Berlusconi's villas as baccha-
nalia with topless girls dancing
around.

DETROIT
DSO officials to
offer proposal to

Detroit Symphony Orchestra
management officials say they are
submitting a contract proposal to
striking musicians as their walk-
out reaches the four-month mark.
Orchestra President Anne Par-
sons said yesterday a proposal
will be provided this week but
declined to say when or what it
includes. She says it comes amid
mounting pressure from revenue
losses stemming from the strike
as well as a $54 million bank loan
that symphony leaders are trying
to renegotiate.
Musicians' spokesman Haden

CHICAGO
Lake Shore Drive
reopens after snow
piles on Windy City
Chicago emergency officials
say they've reopened the city's
Lake Shore Drive after a massive
blizzard left the vital thorough-
fare filled with hundreds of aban-
doned vehicles.
Chicago police say crews
worked overnight to clear snow
and vehicles and emergency offi-
cials reopened the drive before
dawn yesterday. Hundreds of
motorists were stranded, some for
as long as 12 hours, when a bliz-
zard that began late Tuesday left
more than 20 inches of snow. It
was the third most severe storm in
the city's history.
City officials said 900 vehicles
were stranded on the roadway.
An Associated Press tally counted
up to 1,500 cars, buses and other
vehicles.
City officials said closing the
drive earlier would have resulted
in disastrous traffic and possible
accidents on other city streets.

The jury is out on a Lithuanian

blondes in the Maldives.
Olialia (pronounced Oh-la-LA)
has created a business empire
in Lithuania, using its troupe of
glitzy models with platinum hair
to market just about anything
from potato chips to pop music.
There's Olialia pizza and Olialia
cola, even Olialia computers.
With the Maldives resort - and

its blond ambition to a new level.
"Blond is light. It attracts peo-
ple like sunshine," brand manager
Lauryna Anuseviciute, a 24-year-
old former model, explained at
the Olialia office in downtown

E-TEXTBOOKS
From Page 1
at the University Library.
Hollar, who chairs the work-
ing group, said textbooks on
CourseSmart are 50 to 60 per-
cent cheaper than their print
counterparts. However, students
enrolled in the five test classes
this semester didn't have to
worry about paying for course
materials since the University
covered the cost of their e-books.
Scott Campbell, an associ-
ate professor of Urban Planning
and the coordinator of doctoral
planning studies at the Univer-
sity's College of Architecture and
Urban Planning, teaches a course
in the trial program. He said he

appreciates the effort to get text-
books online.
"The more they are available
online the better," Campbell said,
emphasizing the reduced cost as
a key incentive to use electronic
materials.
But Campbell said that not all
the textbooks he needed for his
course were available online.
"I submitted a list of maybe
nine or 10 texts, and a few weeks
later, the library came back to me
and said ... two were available,"
he said.
Rackham student Sylvia Har-
ris, who is taking Campbell's
course, said she liked the expe-
diency of getting her textbooks
online.
"At the beginning of the
semester, when everybody is get-

ting organized and trying to fig-
ure out which books they need to
buy, we can jump right into the
reading material," Harris said.
School of Information gradu-
ate student Debbie Blumenthal,
who is also taking a course in
the pilot program, said one of the
perks of using online textbooks
is not having to carry around so
many books.
"You can go on any computer
that has web access or even any
wireless device and do your read-
ing," Blumenthal said.
But Harris pointed out it's a
problem when instructors don't
allow laptops in classes that
require electronic textbooks.
"It's just hypocritical to say
we're in a paperless world, but we
are not going to use the vehicle

that you use to look at the reading
material in class," she said.
Additionally, the University
program allows students to high-
light passages of the text or take
notes directly in the software..
But the online technology isn't
without some concerns.
Jyoti Mazumder, a professor
of mechanical engineering at the
University who teaches a course
participating in the program,
said his students "have lots of
complaints" about the platform.
"It's very user-unfriendly,"
Mazumder said. "It takes several
clicks to get to the information
you need, (and students) can only
download one page at a time. So
far students are not very happy
with it."
Blumenthal expressed similar

frustrations with the online text-
books.
"There (are) certain features
that don't work," she said. "It's
convenient, but it definitely
needs work. It could be better."
According to Hollar, the
working group surveyed the stu-
dents and instructors last month
to get their general perceptions
on the project. More in-depth
surveys and focus groups will be
conducted next month to hear
about their experiences, she
said.
"I'm sure that there are
going to be ways this tool can
be improved, and we're hoping
that when we will get the stu-
dent feedbacks, that will give us
guidance on how this tool can be
improved," Haller said.


MSA
From Page 1
two proposals of MSA's win-
ter 2011 budget that showed a
$40,000 difference between two
proposed winter budgets. But
Sayed wrote in an e-mail inter-
view after the meeting that such
a discrepancy isn't out of the
ordinary, as funds tend to fluctu-
ate.
"MSA finances are a fluid pro-
cess," Sayed wrote. "On a weekly
and sometimes dailybasis, trans-
actions are continuing to occur
as a result of previously approved
allocations. Thus, changes in the
budget from previous versions
that you have seen are inevitable
and not a result of mistakes or
inaccuracies. Such changes are
fully explicable and not surpris-
ing."
Sayed added that MSA trans-
actions are "fully transparent"
and available to the public.
After Sayed addressed the
assembly, MSA passed its winter
2011 budget, totaling$341,406.
The resolution to amend MSA's

Compiled Code was tabled dur-
ing last night's meeting and will
be open to further consideration
during nextweek's meeting.
MSA also discussed the reso-
lution to support the creation of
a University-sponsored study
abroad program in Israel. The
resolution was originally intro-
duced to MSA at its meeting last
week by Public Policy represen-
tative Steven Zuckerman, a Pub-
lic Policy representative for MSA,
who co-wrote the resolution.
LSA sophomore Caroline
Canning, who was involved in
starting the original campus-
wide petition for an Israel study
abroad program, addressed the
assembly during community
concerns to speak about the reso-
lution. The petition was created
by WolvPAC - a student organi-
zation that works to foster great-
er ties between the United States
and Israel.
LSA senior Mohamad Issa,
an LSA representative for MSA,
proposed to make an amendment
to the resolution to include the
West Bank asa potential location
for students to enroll in a Uni-

versity-sponsored study abroad
program.
This proposed amendment
spurred considerable dialogue
among members of the assembly,
who discussed whether support
of Issa's amendment was politi-
cally motivated and whether it
would detract from the work
already done by students who
drafted the original resolution.
Members of MSA voted
against Issas amendment in a
roll-call vote, with nine members
voting in favor of the amendment
and 16 members voting against
it. The assembly did not vote on
the proposal to support a study
abroad program in Israel.
Issa said he is hopeful for
future MSA resolutions on the
establishment of University-
sponsored study abroad pro-
grams in the West Bank and
other worldwide locations cur-
rently not offered. He said in an
interview after the meeting that
he participated in a Michigan
State University-sponsored study
abroad program in Damascus,
Syria - a place the University
doesn't have a program in.

program. The initiative was
created in response to the city's
worries about the water treat-
ment plant, Artley wrote in an
e-mail interview.
"The impetus for it was con-
cern that (the University) was
contributing too many nutrients
to the city's waste water treat-
ment plant, causing problems
there," Artley wrote. "Offer-
ing the pre-consumer program
was a great way to alleviate this
issue while creating a nutrient-
rich soil amendment."
Instead of throwing away
unused food, Artley said the.
program hopes to reuse it in a
productive way.
"The goal of our pre-con-
sumer food waste composting
program is to divert vegetative
prep waste from the landfill and
waste water treatment plant,
by way of the garbage disposal,
and have it turned into a useful
product," Artley wrote.
Betsy Barbour, East Quad,
Mary Markley, South Quad and
West Quad residence halls have
dining halls that currently use
pre-consumer waste compost-
ing. Food waste in the dining
halls is mixed with wood chips
and is arranged so that air can
circulate and the produce can
decompose more efficiently,.
according to Artley.
Dining hall employees test
the food waste after it has
decomposed to see if it can be
used as fertilizer or soil, accord-
ing to - the University's Plant
Operations website.
The program has been "very
successful to date," Artley
wrote, and the University deliv-

ered more than 60 tons of food
waste to Ann Arbor's compost
site in 2010.
"I think the program has
been very effective," she wrote.
"We continue to collect veg-
etative prep waste from our
campus participants and have
ongoing interest from potential
new customers as well."
Looking toward the future,
Artley said her department
hopes to delve into post-con-
sumer composting, which would
focus on composting remaining
food on consumers' plates like
apple cores and banana peels.
"There is great interest both
in our department and beyond
for a post-consumer food waste
composting program as well,"
she wrote.
LSA junior Angeles Men-
eses, who lived in the residence
halls her freshman and sopho-
more years, said she believes
post-consumer waste recycling
would be "a good step to going
green," especially in the resi-
dence halls.
"People end up getting stuff
on their trays that they end up
not wanting, and it becomes
a big deal, especially with as
many students who live in the
dorms," Menses said.
She added that she thinks
such a program would enhance
existing residence hall practices
like recycling.
LSA senior Jaclyn Silverman,
who is an Environmental Stud-
;es major and frequented the
"diniing halls her fashman year,
said she believes post-consumer
waste composting is something
that should be instituted imme-
diately for residence halls. She
added that she was surprised
the University didn't already
have a post-consumer waste
system in place.

"We set an ambitious goal for
ourselves," Coleman said, "that
by 2015 we would double the
number of minority students
earning bachelor's degrees in the
fields where we mosteneed gradu-
ates - math, science, technology
and engineering."
In an interview with The
Michigan Daily following the
event, Coleman said the Univer-
sity and partner schools need to
work even harder to meet the
ambitious goal.
"What we've seen already is
a 28-percent increase year after
year in the graduation of these
four institutions," Coleman said.
"That's terrific, but we're going to
have to step it up to get to what
our goal is."
However, Coleman said the
28-percent increase is still better
than what many other schools
have seen in the same time
period.
"I think if you compare us
nationally with what we've
done, we've done well," she
said. "But we have aspirations,
and I think this new collabo-
ration will really help us reach
that goal."

spoke at the event and highlight-
ed the impact of MI-LSAMP.
"Nine community college
partners represent a direct link
between the four major public
research universities and the
academic talent within these
community colleges," Monts
said. "What this new partner-
ship can provide are valuable
relationships for community col-
lege students and professors with
engineering faculty, students and
staff at the universities."
Students involved in the pro-
gram also attended the event
yesterday to showcase projects
they're working on.
Rodney Singleton, a graduate
student at Michigan State Uni-
versity, spoke at the event and
said MI-LSAMP was having a
profound impact on his life.

"I can stand here and truly say
LSAMP has changed my life,"
Singleton said.
Singleton began his involve-
ment with the MI-LSAMP pro-
gram after his freshman year. He
joked that he initially joined the
program not only because he was
interested in math, but because
he wanted togain extra brownie
points with his mother.
Jokes aside, Singleton said he
is now working on research in
vehicle infrastructure integra-
tion, which focuses on vehicle
communication with roads and
other vehicles.
"I know this might seem a
little science fiction or some-
thing you might see in a movie,
but these are things that we are
working on right now," he said.
Singleton's research is one of
many projects occurring as part
of MI-LSAMP, with other efforts
focusing on the development of
autonomous robots and solar
energy in automobiles.

Support initiative for foreign-born entrepreneurs
While it may at times appear that the University is virtu-
ally overflowing with students with advanced degrees,
it's not a fair representation of the state as a whole. As
part of his plan to rebuild Michigan's economy, Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder has called for a statewide initiative that would encour-
age foreign-born citizens with advanced college degrees to bring
their ideas and businesses to Michigan. This proposal is an impor-
tant step toward reinventing the state's economy and bringing new,
innovative minds to Michigan. In an effort to combat the so-called
"brain drain" of Michigan, state legislators should support this ini-
tiative and help make it a success.

Spare me the smoke

According to the 2010 U.s. Census, Michi-
gan had the largest number of residents leave
compared to other states. In his recent State of
the State address, Snyder urged state officials
to support this foreign-born entrepreneur-
ial incentive program. The program will.help
solve the problems of both the decreasing pop-
ulation and the extremely high unemployment
rate that plagues Michigan. Snyder claims that
this initiative will boost high-tech industrial
jobs in Michigan - an economic sector that the
state is currently lacking.
The problem of losing highly educated, for-
eign-born people isn't exclusive to the state of
Michigan, but rather a nation wide issue. As
stated in his State of the Union address, Presi-
dent Barack Obama plans on encouraging for-
eign-born students to stay in America and start
businesses. As a nation and a state, we need
to work to retain students with an advanced
degree, so when they complete their educa-
tion we don't lose these bright and innovative
minds. One of the biggest problems facing
Michigan's economy is the lack of entrepre-
neurs and new businesses, and this initiative
can combat that issue by retaining the people
that can help create jobs throughout the state.
It's a common misconception that foreign-
born workers take away jobs from deserving
Michiganders. This ideology is incorrect. The

concept behind Snyder's proposal is to create
new businesses whose growth and develop-
ment will help strengthen the state's economy.
Snyder's initiative would encourage startup
high-tech industries, thus creating countless
jobs that could potentially one day replace the
jobs lost from the decline of the auto indus-
try. This program would create new sectors
and begin diversifying the state economy in a
way that it desperately needs in order to foster
growth.
According to a Jan. 20 Detroit Free Press
article, the state of Michigan has more than
23,000 foreign-born students that are current-
ly earning their advanced degrees, and many
of them are studying here at the University.
It's important that these people stay in Michi-
gan after they graduate, and Snyder's initiative
could help make that happen. Both Detroit and
Ann Arbor have experimented with similar
programs called Global Detroit and the Cul-
tural Ambassadors in Ann Arbor, and in both
cases, the systems have generated economic
growth. This program has shown success in
Ann Arbor and would undeniably show similar
results if implemented statewide.
State officials should adopt Snyder's ini-
tiative to encourage foreign-born graduates
with advanced degrees to start businesses in
Michigan.

Fascist regimes killed millions
of people throughout Europe
in the 20th century. The Uni-
versity will ban
smoking on cam-
pus. One of these
things is not like
the other.
In his view-
point (A bur-
densome ban,
01/26/11),
Timothy Hall ERIC
compares the SZKARLAT
University's
Smoke-Free
Initiative to dictatorial regimes.
He invokes the name of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr. to demonstrate
that the rule will be unjust. In one
fell swoop, Hall has suggested that
the University is as oppressive as
murderous, genocidal governments
or systems that lack any dignity in
humanism. Hyperbole is fine for
comedy, but Hall isn't joking.
Hall also points out that the nature
of government is injustice. It's a nat-
ural byproduct of government, he
claims. What he fails to recognize is
that injustice is a natural byproduct
of almost every similar institution. A
ban on smoking that is remedied by
peer pressure is no more or less just
than a student having to breathe in
second hand smoke while walking to
class. One might even argue that it is
far less just because there are more
non-smokers than there are smok-
ers. And one would be right.
It's 2011. It's not the 1940s or
1950s any longer, and only about 20
percent of Americans smoke. Eighty
percent of Americans make the self-
beneficial decision not tosmoke.
If we continue to allow smokers to

smoke wherever they want, we are
denying those 80 percent the right
not to be around smoke wherever
they want. Protecting the right of
about 80 percent of Americans not to
inhale smoke - first or second hand
- is vital. Why is it even a question?
For what reason are smokers
allowed to smoke in any place they
want? People can't be naked wher-
ever they like. Why? Because the
majority doesn't want to see it. Peo-
ple can't start blasting their music as
loudly as they want wherever they
like. Why? Because the majority
doesn't want to hear it. People can't
even necessarily protest whenever
or wherever they like.Why? Because
most people don't want to be both-
ered by it. How is smoking any dif-
ferent? The majority doesn't want to
smell it or inhale it.
Isn't that what this boils down
to? Common courtesy - two words
mean so much. If you don't want
me to walk up to you and spit in
your face - which is fairly common
courtesy - then don't sit there and
smoke in mine. Have the dignity
and respect for yourself and for me
that you would afford a random
stranger in any other dynamic. I
certainly doubt you would spit on a
stranger, right?
If people practiced common cour-
tesy about smoking, and smoked
only in designated areas, then there
would be virtually no problem with
the ban. It wouldn't be implemented
because it wouldn't be necessary. The
"authoritarian, oppressive" govern-
ment reacts to substantial societal
problems. Remember that govern-
ment isn't the only thing that can be
oppressive.Society can be too.
Hall says the policy to permit

peer pressure to govern the ban
degrades humanity. But peer pres-
sure shouldn't be necessary.
When I'm walking down the
street, and I have to hold my breath
so as not to inhale that god-awful
smell coming from the person's
cigarette in front of me, I know that
my comfort is being compromised.
When I walk out of Mason Hall in
the morning to be greeted by a puff
of smoke, Iknow others aren't giving
me any courtesy.
The ban respects
the lifestyle of
the majority.

I've made my choice concerning
my health. I don't want to be a smok-
er. Several members of my family
have passed away from cancer and
smoking-related illnesses. I under-
stand that other people can make
educated decisions regarding their
health. And although I still believe
that smoking is never a good choice
for your health, I still recognize that
others have a right to do it. Under
the ban, you may still smoke. It's just
a matter of where.
And in any case, maybe the ban
will help smokers. Smoking is a poor
health choice no matter how you
dice it. If it's discouraged, it may just
save your life. obviously, this was
the plan of the evil fascist heads of
the University all along. Damn them.

ANDREW WEINER VIEWPOINT
Addictive birds

The recent events in Egypt have elicited
responses from all around the world. From
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to Pres-
ident Barack Obama, big names have spoken
out about the civil rights unrest in Egypt. This
isn't to say the events have gone ignored here
in Ann Arbor. University students gathered in
the Diag last Friday to protest the Egyptian
government's oppression of human rights. See-
ing students unite for a cause occurring half-
way around the world is a refreshing reminder
of the depth of diversity atthis school.
According to a Michigan Daily article last
week, (Students show support for Egyptian
uprising in Diag protest, 01/28/2011) students
gathered on the Diag in response to the unrest
in Egypt, where protesters have risen up in
opposition to President Hosni Mubarak. The
students gathered with signs and various
chants to convey their opposition to Mubarak's
handling of the situation.
In a day and age when the youth are
increasingly criticized for being ignorant and
apathetic, it's nice to see individuals mobi-
lize behind a cause. The University is widely
known for its activism. As LSA senior Noha
Moustafa told the Daily, it's "a testament to
the student activism that is on this campus."
Students of different backgrounds, faiths and
ethnicities gather together in order to make
their voices heard.
What was most surprising - ina good way,
of course - was the sheer number of students
present at the protest. Such a large turnout
reveals that students not only are aware of
their surroundings, but are passionate enough
to want to act on that awareness. The crisis in
Egypt is one of many examples of violations
of individual rights. It's refreshing to see the
myriad of organizations and student groups
devoted to a variety of issues and causes at the

University. In addition to academia and athlet-
ics, the University boasts a student population
that genuinely strives to positively impact the
world in whichthey live.
If the situation in Egypt illustrates any-
thing, it's this: In the end, it's individuals who
have the power to change things. Individuals
in Egypt rose up against the policies ofthe gov-
ernment, individuals here demonstrated their
support and many others formulated protests
around the United States. The problems of the
world can't be solved by governments or other
social institutions alone - a great amount of
power lies in individual will. For, in the words
of cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead,
"Never doubt that a small group of committed
people can change the world. Indeed, it is the
only thing that ever has."
In that spirit, I request those of you who
haven't yet found one, to pick upa cause. With
classes and clubs and friends and other obli-
gations, I know time is scarce. But, still take
some time to think about your passions, your
purpose, about the things that you want to
improve in the world, the problems you want
to solve and the mark you want to leave.
Whether it's volunteering at elementary
schools or raising money for flood victims in
Pakistan, find what makes you come alive and
actually act upon it. There are countless issues
that need to be addressed in the world, often
in areas far beyond our daily life routines. Step
beyond those daily routines momentarily to
find something in the world that impacts you
and use that to impact the world. The events
in Egypt are an inspiration to us all, showing
us all that a group of motivated and passionate
individuals can initiate a major change.

Sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing it. It might'
be in the middle of watching a show on Hulu, during a
particularly boring film lecture or while enthralled in
the incredibly rare not-boring film lecture.
Suddenly I regain consciousness and realize that I've
been sling-shotting multi-talented birds at green pigs for
the past 10 minutes. Just like my new-found apprecia-
tion for the less-than-delicious cafeteria chocolate chip
cookies and Kanye West, my addiction to playing Angry
Birds certainly can't be attributed to quality, and it defi-
nitely isn't healthy.
For those who are blissfully unaware, Angry Birds
is an iPhone/iPad app that you shouldn't download. I
had heard murmurs of the game when it was gaining
momentum, but hadn't investigated it - Blackberry Tet-
ris fulfilled all my mindless gaming needs. Then over
Winter break I was vacationing with my family, and
needless to say was, in desperate need of entertainment.
My mother's suggestion: A game she had downloaded
("Downloaded? Is that the right word for what I did? Did
I pay for this?") on her iPad.
Talk about irresponsible parenting - it was almost
like she suggested I take up an addiction to cocaine.
Sure, an iPad app is cheaper and causes fewer nose-
bleeds, but I haven't heard of rehab for people who like
flinging farm animals at other farm animals.
Angry Birds didn't consume me right away. Our rela-
tionship started healthy. If I saw the iPad sitting out I'd
pick it up and give it a go, but was less than enthused.
One day my sister passed me the iPad to get a differ-
ent approach to a level she'd been stuck on for a while.
I randomly tossed the birds with no particular strategy
in mind. The yellow, triangular bird made contact with
the jungle-gym of wood and glass, which came crash-
ing down. One by one, the chain reaction crushed all the
pigs and completed the level.
Whoathere.
My heart raced. I couldn't help but wonder if I had
discovered another skill to add to my List of Talents -
which up to that point consisted of "badly rapping along
to Kanye West songs," "laying on flat surfaces" and "eat-
ing Wheat Thins."
Right there I should have foreseen the problem.
Unlike Tetris, I had beaten a level in seconds. Little
investment for a huge reward. It was instant gratifica-

tion, and I was hooked.
My early success - in the most modest sense of the
word - didn't last long. I began to play more and more.
Like in real life, I made decisions with no thought of
consequences. No strategy, just non-stop action. I would
play a level, lose and hit "restart." Then lose again and
click "restart." Eventually, I didn't even wait for the first
bird to make contact. More time was spent resetting the
game than actually playing it.
In a game like Angry Birds, however, my lack of strat-
egy worked well. There are no limits to the amount of
attempts at each level, allowing for continuous play.
After playinga level for half an hour, the odds of winning
are in the player's favor. Every 50th time I attempted a
level, I was bound to win.
New Years passed, and second semester began. With-
out an iPad, my obsession subsided. But Steve Jobs
couldn't let me go minutes without having my hands on
an Apple product. The Mac App Store launched on Jan.
6. The top selling app? Angry Birds. For about $5, all the
obsessive-compulsive, big-screen fun was mine.
Since the purchase, I can't remember an occasion I've
taken out my laptop without giving into the call of the
Angry Birds icon at the bottom of the screen. If I cal-
culated all the time I spent playing, the cost per hour of
play is probably about 15 cents.
It isn't fun anymore, but I can't stop. Flinging birds is
like playinga slot machine. It's mindless and repetitive,
and only offers an occasional payout that's enough to
keep me going.
It's not just me who's become addicted. Angry Birds
recently overtook The Legend of Zelda as the No.1
selling video game ever - 75 million downloads and
counting. Rovio, the company responsible for the game,
recently announced an expansion of Angry Birds to
myriad new platforms.
The appeal of the game is that you're allowed to
hit "reset." In real life, consequences exist. We can't
restart the day whenever a mistake is made. We have
to learn from them and hope that a chance to redeem
ourselves and apply the lesson presents itself. But
that's easier said than done. In the meantime, I'll be
sling-shotting birds.

Ross MBA students
get wild for the

By CASSIE BALFOUR
DailyArts Writer
"On a frosty, blustery day on

pus ... a murder occurs," intoned
Business graduate student Matt
Harms,
describing
the ideal S AWO7

about his

Business
School Follies. And if his antics
are any indication, the show is
going to be a hoot. However,
the comedy show is currently
on Quadruple Secret Lockdown
- Follies shorthand for, if you
want to find out what the show is
all about, you're going to have to
see it yourself. .
"Follies" refers to a once-a-
year comedy show written, pro-
duced and performed by the very
Ross MBA candidates who in a
few short years will be dictating
our economy. Until then, they're
happy just to make audiences
laugh. This year's comedy show,
titled "It's Always Funny in Fol-
lydelphia," will be performed
tonight and tomorrow at the
Michigan Theater and will fea-
ture live skits, singing and danc-
ing, mixed in with some video
clips. Since the humor is Ross-
oriented, it could be said that the
show is one big inside joke.
"The skits make fun of profes-
sors who have certain quirks,
and just the MBA style of life,
how we all still act like under-
graduates," said assistant direc-
tor and Business graduate
studen "Kiistin Girouard.-"We
make fun of how the guys love
Sundergrads, we just make fun of
the daily things in life that we
talk about when we're hanging
out in the Winter Garden."
Although the jokes may be
geared toward Ross students,
the writers don't want to dis-
courage undergraduates or other
members of the campus commu-
nity from coming to the show. In
fact, the writing staff has a per-
sonal request: that undergradu-

of the 7th Annual Midwest Hip
Hop Congress Summit, which
will take place this weekend at
the Michigan Union and League,
seek to counteract the negative
and contradictory associations
so common to hip-hop music and
culture.
"The Hip Hop Summit is
designed to promote a diverse,
inclusive space on campus," said
Amer Ahmed, associate director
of the Office of Multi-Ethnic Stu-
dent Affairs (MESA) in an inter-
view with the Daily. "We know
that there's all sorts of problemat-
ic representations and distortions
of hip-hop culture in our media.
So how do we use people's inter-
ests in hip hop as a way to channel
them into spaces ... more instruc-
tive and more educational?"
The solution found by the
summit organizers is to provide
seminars and concerts by artists
who focus on the positive aspects
of hip hop, using the medium as
a vehicle for social justice and

activism. Headlining this year's
summit is Freeway, a Philadel-
phia-based rapper who left the
drug-dealing world for a career
with Jay-Z's Roc-a-Fella label in
the early'00s.
"(Freeway is) a well known
artist, and we feel like he's a
name that attracts a lot of people
without any significant negative
stereotypes associated," Ahmed
said. "At the same time, we real-
ly do try to focus on a lot of the
other artists, beyond just the
headliner."
Other artists who will per-
form this weekend include the
ReMINDers - a husband-and-
wife hip-hop and soul duo -
Detroit rapper Invincible and
Magestik Legend - a local artist
who has played alongside rap leg-
ends from De La Soul to Ludacris.
The seminars held during the
summit are attended by the art-
ists in addition to community
activists and any member of the
public who's interested. Ahmed
said it's not just students who
participate.
"It's mixed ... I would say more
than half the attendees are stu-
dents from the University, but we
also have young people," Ahmed
said.
One of Ahmed's goals in orga-
nizing this year's summit - a
goal that's shared by collaborat-
ing youth groups like the Neutral
Zone and the GEAR UP program
- is to involve high school stu-
dents, giving them a constructive
outlet for their musical interests
and the simple opportunity to
engage with their college peers.
"It's good for them to be
around college students, and it's
good for college students to be
around high school students,
because a lot of times college stu-

dents ... get disconnected from
that reality," Ahmed said. "They
don't necessarily realize how
great of mentors they can be just
by being college students on a col-
lege campus."
The summit's seminars, which
include workshops on each of the
four pillars of hip hop - DJ-ing,
MC-ing, graffiti and breakdance
- delve into a culture whose pop-
ular perception is often reduced
to drug references and violent
undertones. Ahmed emphasized
that hip-hop expression is more
vibrant than most realize - par-
ticularly in Ann Arbor.
Changing
perceptions
about hip hop.
"(Our perception of hip hop
is) probably more diverse than it
is in other places because of the
diversity of our community and
the different kinds of experienc-
es and backgrounds people come
from," Ahmed said. "There's a
student organization called Hip
Hop Academy that teaches the
different elements of hip hop; a
lot of those students are Korean-
American ... (so) they brought
Korean breakdancers out in
October."
Though the University's out-
lets for the hip hop-inclined
are both various and varied, it
remains a misunderstood move-
ment by a large part of the popu-
lation. By showing an alternate,
more constructive side to the cul-
ture, the Hip Hop Summit hopes
to change minds.

ERIN KIRKLAND/Daily
In this economy, even Ross MBA students need a diverse skill set.

fit the Daily and campus at large.
It's easy to see where the Fol-
lies cull their material from.
Although undergraduates
aren't part of the show, more
than half of both MBA classes
are involved in some aspect of
the Follies. This bonds the rela-
tively small MBA community
together even more, drawing
in more Follie wannabes every
year.
"We're a relatively small com-
munity on a really big college
campus ... everyone is support-
ive and they cheer each other
on," said director and Business
school graduate student Paul
Bockwoldt. "A lot of the faculty
members get involved with the
show; this year we have about
twelve staff members. Anyone
who wants to be part of the show
can be part of the show."
Although some may be
surprised that. these but-
toned-up "Yodng Urban rofes-
sionals" would have the time or
the pizazz to put on a comedy
show, many MBA students use it
as a creative outlet and as a way
to poke fun at what Bockwoldt
called "the daily monotony of
Business school."
"It's a lot different from doing
spreadsheets and reading the
Wall Street Journal," he added.
Although producer and Busi-
ness School graduate student
Laura Stancik says that "no one
should quit their day jobs" in the
show's cast because very few
members actually come from
a theatrical background, it's
apparent that all it takes to make
the comedy show enjoyable is a

lot of dedication.
"You just have to be able to
make a fool out of yourself," Gir-
ouad said.
"A lot of singers have a back-
ground, but a lot of Business
School kids don't come from a
theatrical background ... weird,.
right?" Girouard said. "Some
people come in during auditions,
and you'll ask them if they can
sing and they'll say, 'Yeah, badly.'
So if you see the skits, people just
go crazy with it, and it's hilari-
ous because the lack of talent is
part of why it makes it so funny.
People use the show as a way to
break out of their shells."
Some of the participants
agree that the arts and business
aren't all that mutually exclusive
after all.
"You think that business is
straight-laced, and this is more
arts- and creative-based, but I
think increasingly in business,
there is that level ofs creativity
that people know they need to
have," Girouard said. "And this
is a way to sort of get at that cre-
ativity and bring it out."
Although they only have a
month and a half to rehearse and
pull the show together, everyone
is in jovial spirits. And the pro-
cess has had it's fair share of -
ahem - follies.
"The end of the third night
... we were exhausted after all
of the auditions," Stancik said.
"We didn't realize the camera
was still rolling and we started
dancing and singing ourselves,
but then we saw the red light
was still on. It was a great Follies
moment."

get there.
Jed's mother, Betsy Erwin,
said in an interview last year
that her son's difficulties navi-
gating after a snowstorm are
due to the lack of coordination
in snow removal between the
city and the University, caus-
ing snow mounds to accumulate
to levels too high for her son to
pass.
"The city came through after
the University plowed, and when
the city came through, they left
mounds of snow at the curb's
cuts, and that was Jed's biggest
issue," she said.
LSA senior Claire Abraham,
who has been in a wheelchair
since she was four years old, said
in an interview last year that she
has also faced challenges in the

winter.
Commuting from Novi, Mich.
during her first two years at the
University, Abraham found it
difficult to park her van with
snow on the ground.
"I have a wheelchair lift on
my van, and the lift obvious-
ly wouldn't go down over the
snow," Abraham said.
Abraham lived in Betsy Bar-
bour Residence Hall last year
and said the snow on the side-
walks near the residence hall
posed a problem for her.
"There is a big pile of snow
right (outside), and I can plow
through it with my wheelchair
pretty easily, but when it's sit-
ting there for a while it gets
kind of hard to plow through it,"
Abraham said last year.
Carole Dubritsky, Americans
with Disabilities Act coordinator
for the University, wrote in an
e-mail interview that after talk-

ing with students on campus,
she found that while sidewalks
and streets are traversable, large
amounts of snowfall around
curbs can cause difficulties for
disabled students.
"In talking with students, fac-
ulty, staff and visitors with dis-
abilities about this issue, they
have reported that although
UM sidewalks are passable,
curb cuts - which are essential
for crossing streets for those
with disabilities - may become
impassable when there has been
significant snowfall," Dubritsky
wrote.
The University strives to
make snow removal "a prior-
ity," she wrote, and officials go
to sites multiples times a day to
ensure students have optimal
access to sidewalks.
"The University makes every
effort to revisit locations receiv-
ing the most pedestrian traffic in

an effort to keep these intersec-
tions and the curb cuts free from
snow," Dubritsky wrote.
She added that disabled stu-
dents have the option to utilize
Paratransit Services, a Universi-
ty company that provides door-
to-door transportation ,during
the winter months.
Kirk Pennington, street main-
tenance field operations super-
visor for the city of Ann Arbor,
said that the city and the Uni-
versity snow services have "very
minimal coordination."
Pennington said the city's
main responsibilities are to clear
city streets including North Uni-
versity Avenue, South Univer-
sity Avenue and State Street. He
added that it is the responsibil-
ity of property owners, not city
plows, to remove snow piles out-
side the owners' properties.
John Lawter, associate direc-
tor of Building Services and

Grounds for the University, said
the University's plowing opera-
tion functions as a separate enti-
ty from the city's plows.
"It's two independent opera-
tions," Lawter said. "We don't
call them every time there is a
snow."
However, Lawter said the two
operations occasionally share
resources. He highlighted the
instance a few years ago when
the University had a salt short-
age and borrowed from the city.
The University is mainly
responsible for plowing side-
walks, handicapped ramps, bus
stops and other University areas,
Lawter said. He added that the
University is forced to outsource
some of the snow removal to out-
side contractors.
"We can't size ourselves to do
everything that needs to be done
so we do have some contracts out
there," Lawter said.

During a radio interview on
WTKA on Wednesday morning,
Hayes said that he and Rawls
have already talked about play-
ing with each other. And as
Hayes put it, he could be the out-
side man while Rawls works the
middle.
Hoke said Wednesday that he
recruits a few high school run-
ning backs because they're usu-
ally the best athletes on the field.
It doesn't necessarily matter if he
already has a full stable of backs,
because they can be moved to
other positions, he said. That may
be the case with Hayes, who, at
5-foot-10, 175 pounds, could be an
athlete that Michigan will need
to find a way to get on the field.
"(Hayes) can play any posi-
tion," Jackson said. "Very ath-
letic, can catch the ball out of the
backfield. Tough kid. Very com-
petitive ... He can play anywhere
- corner, safety, running back,
slot. He's just athletic."
Jackson added that Hayes's
preference is to play running
back and that he will be given
a chance to play the position,
but Jackson didn't know where
Hayes would end up.
Even though he is on the small-
er side now, Hoke estimated that
Hayes could be up to around 190
pounds in the next year. When
Hoke arrived at Hayes's name on
Wednesday, as he announced the
recruiting class, Hoke knew the

offense.
And the wild cards may be
Toussaint - who was interrupt-
ed by injuries in 2010 - and Cox,
who never saw much playing
time under Rodriguez.
The resurgence of the pro-

style offense also has brought
back the use of a true fullback in
the sets that the Wolverines will
run. But there's a problem: Rodri-
guez didn't recruit fullbacks and
there isn't one in Hoke's 2011
recruiting class.
Could Hopkins play some full-
back too?
"He may have to," Jackson
said. "But I don't think I have
another guy other than John

McColgan appeared in just
two games in 2010. Another pos-
sibility is that a player currently
on the team could make a posi-
tion change. For now, Jackson's

just under two
minutes into the second over-
time of the NCAA regional final,

Four and sending the Wolverines
home empty-handed.
This weekend, No. 9 Michigan
will have its first matchup with
the RedHawks since that double-
overtime thriller. And the Wol-
verines couldn't be up against
stiffer odds.
Though the Wolverines (14-
5-1-0 CCHA, 17-7-4 overall)
are four points ahead of No. 13
Miami in the conference stand-
ings, the weekend series will be
held at Cady Arena - a venue in
which the RedHawks haven't lost
in over two months and boast an
overall 8-3-1 record.
Last season, Miami (11-7-4-2,
14-9-5) sat atop the conference
for much of the year, but now the
RedHawks - unbeaten in their
past three games - are trying
to play catch-up in the CCHA.
Michigan is sure to face a formi-
dable attack on Friday and Satur-
day.
"The skill level that we'll play
against and the sense of urgency
that their team is under - and
our team, too - will bring out a
real challenge for us," Michigan
coach Red Berenson said. "Their
home record is pretty emphatic.
"Last year maybe they were
taking some things for granted
and they were cruising late in the
year, but they won't be cruising
now. I think we'll see their abso-
lute best hockey."

By ZACH HELFAND
Daily Sports Writer
Lion Kim puts in a lot of time
during the offseason.
On a typical day, he spends
about three hours in individual
practice, after returning from
class. Immediately afterward,
he meets his teammates for
strength and conditioning work
- doing bench presses, squats,
lunges, all the typical major
lifts. His coach says this work is
necessary for succeeding in golf.
Wait ... golf?
When casual sports fans
think of a golfer, they may -pic-
ture a John Daly or a weekend
warrior crushing a six-pack
on the back of his cart. But for
every John Daly, there are hun-
dreds of Tiger Woods or Ricky
Barnes - workout machines
whose strength and fitness give
them an edge on the course and
cut down on strokes.
For the Michigan golf team,
whose lack of access to a play-
able course during the winter
months can put it at a disad-
vantage to southern schools,
effective offseason work can be
critically important.
From October until the
beginning of the spring season
in mid-February, the team is
in the gym five days a week, in
addition to work on the range,
chipping, putting and swing-
diagnostic work at the team's
indoor facility in the basement
of the University's golf course.
The work is designed to limit
the advantages southern schools
may gain during the winter
and also to give Michigan an
edge unique to colder-climate
schools.
"I think the nice thing for our
players really is they can work a
lot on their fundamentals with-
out worrying about having to
post a score," Michigan coach
Andrew Sapp said. "It can be
beneficial if someone's really
working on some swing chang-
es. Sometimes swing changes
can cause you to play poorly, ask
Tiger Woods. This way they're
not necessarily having to lose
confidence if they play poorly."
And while not being able to
play on a course may lead to
some higher scores at the begin-
ning of the season, sophomore
Miguel Echavarria says that
after the first two or three tour-
naments, scores begin to level
out.
By the time the bigger tour-
naments arrive toward the end

of the season, the team has
shaken off the rust and is still
able to capitalize on its training
regimen.
A successful college golfer is
cveated from hours spent on the
driving range and-the putting
green.
But the Wolverines are prov-
ing that work in the weight room
and on the track can be equally
as important.
During the winter, strength
and conditioning coach Jon
Sanderson puts the team
through weight training work
alternated with conditioning
sessions.
The program is designed to
limit injuries, build strength for
longer drives and increase stam-
ina. The latter might be surpris-
ing to those not familiar with
college golf.
"Swing changes
can cause (poor
play), just ask
Tiger Woods."
"I want to say 85 to 90 per-
cent is endurance in college
golf," Kim said. "You've got to be
really physically fit and ... men-
tally stay in it so that you don't
lose focus."
Including the practice round,
a typical tournament involves
72 holes in three days, half of
which are played on the first
day. That amounts to about nine
hours and 10 miles worth of
walking when you account for
the distance from the tee to the
green to the next tee box. Add a
bag that is comparable in weight
to a young child, and you've got a
pretty grueling day.
"Without conditioning, I
remember at the beginning
when I started, you do finish
really tired and sometimes your
more focused on ... your legs ...
hurting or (you're) just thirsty
and (you) don't want to keep
going," Echavarria said. "Now,
with conditioning, it's like, 'OK,
I've done this before. I've been
in worse situations in the weight
room where I've been more tired
and I've still ... accomplished
what I wanted to.'
"You just get it done, focus
more on the golf side of the
game."

SALAM RiDA/Daily
Senior forward Louie Caporusso and the Wolverines head to Oxford, Ohio for a weekend series with the RedHawks.

the RedHawks will be its biggest
test of the season. Miami has five
players with more than 10 goals
this season - Michigan has only
two.
The RedHawks are led by
the nation's two top scorers -
fowards Andy Miele and Carter
Camper, who have 49 and 46
points, respectively.
According to Berenson, if the
Wolverines display anything
less than an all-around defensive
shutdown, "they'll embarrass
you."
"We're obviously aware of how
dominant they've been all year,"
senior forward Louie Caporusso
said of Miele and Camper. "Their
points don't lie. I watched their
game against Notre Dame, and
they both looked like the most
standout players on the ice. Obvi-
ously we've got to keep an eye on
them ... Guys like that can change

the game, and we'll be looking
out for them."
Added Berenson: "We're not
going to change the way Miele
plays, or anyone else, but we've
seen it with our best players in
the past, if they're checked really
closely and not given the chance
to do whatthey're really good at."
Regardless, Michigan's
CCHA-leading defense is going
to be tested and tried by Miami's
league-leading offense.
Though Michigan is the
stronger team in the standings,
Berenson still considers the Wol-
verines the team left with some-
thing to prove in Oxford, Ohio
this weekend.
"We might not appear to be so
much of an underdog, but I see us
as an underdog going into their
building under the current situ-
ation," Berenson said. "So we've
got to play like the underdog."

As far as motivation goes,
Michigan doesn't need to look
past the 3-2 overtime heart-
breaker against the RedHawks
last March.
"It's always something we
remember, but things change,"
Caporusso said. "But it's a new
team this year, we're a new team,
so we'll see what this weekend
has in store. Obviously there's a
rivalry that's built up between
us."
NOTES: After being sidelined
for nearly two months with a
groin injury sustained before
The Big Chill at the Big House,
senior goaltender Bryan Hogan
will travel with the team this
weekend.
"(Bryan) is goingto travel, he'll
be our backup goalie," Berenson
said on Wednesday. "So we'll
take two goalies, but Hunwick
will play both games."

"They had a great gameplan to take it to another level."

Michigan quickly got into
foul trouble, with Morris, junior
guard Zack Novak and freshman
forward Evan Smotrycz picking
up their third fouls with 14:20
still left in the game.
The Wolverines had to reign
in their aggression defending the
post, allowing Sullinger to easily
score over the guards who came
down from the perimeter to help
hinder him.
After the game, Michigan
coach John Beilein compared the
freshman superstar to former
Oklahoma forward Blake Griffin,
who dominated the Wolverines in
the NCAA Tournament two sea-
sons ago.
"When you're guarding the
length and the quicknessthat they
have, and when you're guarding
Jared Sullinger, it is very hard to
guard him and stop him without
fouling," Beilein said. "You're
looking at the No. 1 team in the
country. You're looking at a team
that really has a great plan, (and)
they're trying to get the ball to the
right people."
Though Michigan managed to
hold Sullinger to just 12 points in
Ohio State's win at Crisler Arena
on Jan. 12, this time around the
forward exploded for 19 points
and 15 rebounds.
And Ohio State quickly reached
the bonus in the second frame.

The Buckeyes went just 15-for-25
from the foul line for the game,
while the Wolverines had just
four attempts.
Guard William Buford's
3-pointer with 11:34 left in the
game capped another 7-0 Ohio
State run and allowed the Buck-
eyes to firmly establish momen-
tum after an up-and-down start
to the second half.
"We knew they were going
to come out with a momentum
shift," freshman guard Tim
Hardaway Jr. said. "It was just
how we could (respond to) it.
(Against) Michigan State, we did
a great job capitalizing on it and
weren't getting discouraged. But
things go that way."
Michigan - hampered by its
inability to execute its gameplan
on defense - found itself stum-
bling yet again on thesother end.
Redshirt freshman forward Jor-
dan Morgan had 10 second-half
points, but more often than not,
the Buckeyes stymied the pick-
and-roll attack that they forced
the Wolverines into.
"We tried to make more
adjustments about how they
were playing us," Beilein said.
"They did a great job. They took
us out of some things that more
experienced players would be
able to adapt to. We did not do it
well."

COLUMBUS -
f only John Beilein had a
fast forward button.
Thursday LUKE
night's PASCH
matchup
between the On Men's
Wolverines Basketball
and the
top-ranked Buckeyes was yet
another sign that it just isn't
Michigan's year to shine onthe
hardwood.
Beilein's squad didn't play a
polished game of basketball - not
even close. In Michigan's 62-53
loss to Ohio State, the Wolverines
were just 6-for-19 from beyond
the arc. They lost the rebounding
battle yet again. They finished
with more turnovers than assists.
And they picked up a whopping
23 team fouls - the team's Achil-
les heel all'nightlong.
Butcould you have really
expected anything different?
The man-to-man matchups in
this game were justosilly - it was
hard not to laugh outloud during
the team introductions. Redshirt
freshman forward Jordan Mor-
gan on senior Dallas Lauderdale.
Freshman Tim Hardaway Jr. on
senior David Lighty. Freshman
forward Evan Smotrycz on fresh-
man center Jared Sullinger.
I'm not kidding - that last
one actually happened. The
slow-footed, relatively unathletic
Smotrycz was expectedto lock
down 6-foot-9, 280-pound player-
of-the-year candidate Jared Sull-
inger. Yeah, likethatwas goingcto
happen.
It didn't matter much when
Smotrycz had help either. Late in
the first half, Sullingerstreaked
to the hoop, and senior William
Buford lofted an alley-oop pass
from the perimeter. Michigan
junior guard Zack Novak eased
off his man to step in front of the
play, onlyto getposterized and
have Sullinger's feet dangling in
his face as the Columbus native
hung on the rim for what seemed
like ten seconds.
I know you'rectired of hearing
this. In fact, I'm tired of saying
it. And I'm tired ofgBeilein saying
it. But itsjust the fact: Michigan
is young - too young to beat the
Buckeyes this year, along with a
number of other experienced Big
Ten teams.
But here's something different,
something constructive.
In Beilein's eyes, and in mine,

the Wolverines are built to win
this battle inthe long run. I'm
telling you this because it's hard
to see it without going into the
locker room after games. It's
not something you notice from
a baseline seat in the Maize
Rage, or from your couch as you
watch Sullinger rack up 19 points
against Michigan on ESPN.
One year from now, the Wol-
verines will winthis game.
After this season, Ohio State
will bode farewell to an incred-
ibly talented senior class. Bye-bye
Lauderdale. Bye-bye Lighty.
Bye-bye Jon Diebler. And at that
point, why would Sullinger stay?
Bye-bye Jared Sullinger, have fun
in the NBA.
That'snot to saythe Buck-
eyes are going to be pushovers,
as freshmen forward Deshaun
Thomas and point guard Aaron
Craft are well on their way to
becoming premiere Big Ten tal-
ents. But all of a sudden,cthey'll
only have one senior in Buford
(There are two, actuallybuthave
you ever heard of Lenzelle Smith
Jr.? Yeah, me neither).
Then, you look at the Wolver-
ines, who will do nothing but
welcome new faces to next year's
squad. Everybody will be a year
older. Nobody is leaving.
Here's what will happen next
winter: Michigan's young front-
court defense will learnto be in
the right position more often, so
Smotrycz and Hardaway won't
combine for nine fouls. Morgan
will learn that he's too under-
sized to go straight up to the
hoop, so he'll show offsome more

Sophomore pointguard Darius
Morris will learn that he can't
always score by dribbling into
traffic, so he won't turn the ball
over six times.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Penn State overwhelms Michigan lacks aggression,
'M'to stay in first place offense struggles in loss

Late in the firsthalf, the Mich-
igan women's basketball team
trailed Penn State by just three
points
despite PENN STATE 81
being rid- MICHIGAN 63
died for
15 minutes with lethargic play.
Sophomore guard Jenny Ryan
had just hit a 3-pointer, and the
Wolverines seemed to be right
back in the game, their early
struggles notwithstanding.
110 seconds later, they were
down by 10.
It was that kind of night for
Michigan.
The Wolverines took a beat-
ing from Penn State on Thurs-
day night, losing 81-63 in a game
where they looked stagnant from
the opening tip. Michigan (6-4
Big Ten, 13-9 overall) had an
outside chance to pull into first
place in the Big Ten with a vic-
tory, but instead fell into atie for
fourth with Purdue.
Apart from their 3-point
shooting, the Wolverines played
a solid game on offense. They
shot a dismal 27 percent from
downtown in the first half, but
were able to find easy shotsunder
the basket. Michigan's back-
court of junior Courtney Boylan

and senior Veronica Hicks each
scored 10 points on the game,
even with intense defensive
pressure from the Nittany Lions.
Sophomore forward Rachel
Sheffer led the team in scoring
for the third straight game with
13 points-most of those coming
off close shots on dishes from
Ryan. She finished with seven
assists and eight points, freeing
up an abundance of open perim-
eter shots. The issue, however,
was that Michigan wasn't mak-
ing them.
"I honestly just think we
couldn't hit shots," Boylan said
after the game. "It just seems
like we hit those shots on a regu-
lar basis, and in the games we're
winning, we seem to hit them
and tonight, it just didn't hap-
pen."
Offense wasn't the most glar-
ing issue for Michigan, though.
Penn State (8-2, 19-5) and its
vaunted offense came into the
contest averaging 80 points per
game, and it was clear why from
the get go.
When Michigan scored or
gained momentum, Penn State
often responded with a bucket of
its own.
"It seemed to me like we were
stuck in the mud," Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth said. "They
just did whatever they wanted to

on the offensive end of the floor."
Penn State shot 57 percent
from the floor, including an
astounding 68 percent in the sec-
ond half to put the game away.
Even in the rare occasion that
the Nittany Lions missed, their
post players still did a good job of
cleaning up the boards, scoring
14 points off offensive rebounds.
Five Penn State players scored
in the double digits, but none was
more impressive than freshman
guard Maggie Lucas. She scored
agame-high 23 points, punishing
the Michigan defense any time it
made even the tiniest mistake.
"We flew at (Lucas) probably
more times than we wanted to,"
Borseth said. "Every time we
flew at her, she did one dribble,
pulled up and boom. They can
really pull up and shoot, that's
what they're good at."
The Nittany Lions proved they
are in first place for a reason.
"They hit a lot of shots obvi-
ously; we gave them a lot of
shots," Borseth said. "But they're
really good."
Michigan has a quick turn-
around, playing Illinois at home
on Sunday, in a game that will be
very important for the Wolver-
ines' Big Ten standing.
"We just need to go back in the
gym, get our confidence back and
work at it," Hicks said.

Michigan shot just
44 percent against
Nittany Lions

Sophomoreguard Kate Thomp-
son went to the line to shoot two
free throws with 0.1 seconds left
on the game clock. She hit both,
but the two points were a mere
dent in the Wolverines' then-20
point deficit.
Her last second freebies
were two of just four free throw
attempts in Michigan's 81-63 loss
to Big Ten leader Penn State.
The negligible amount of the
Wolverines' trips to the charity
stripe could easily be explained
by a lack of aggression. Michigan
could've used those extra points
at the line; it just didn't have the
opportunity.
"It can be taken a bunch of dif-
ferentways," seniorguardVeroni-
ca Hicks said after the game.
"Maybe it's lack of aggression,
maybe it's notgettingtwofeetand
making the refs call the foul. It's
somethingwe'llhave tolook at the
film more and see what we could
do better in that area."
