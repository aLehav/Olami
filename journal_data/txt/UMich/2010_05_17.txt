TENT CITY
Homeless
opt for tent
community
Camp Take Notice
continues to offer
shelter after eviction
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
Despite recent trouble with the
Michigan State Police, Camp Take
Notice - a self-governing group of
homeless individuals living in tents -
still hopes to remain a viable shelter
option for the homeless in Washtenaw
County.
With the county's homeless popu-
lation growing too quickly for local
homeless shelters to accommodate,
the residents of CTN and the members
of Michigan Itinerant Shelter System:
Independent out of Necessity-the
non-profit organization that supports
CTN - want to bring to Washtenaw
County a tent city model that has
proved successful in Seattle, Wash-
ington.
Caleb Poirier, one of the founding
residents of CTN, brought the concept
of an organized, self-governing tent
city to Ann Arbor after spending two
years in a tent city in Seattle. Poirer
said the tent cities in Seattle organized
by the Seattle Housing and Resource
Effort, or SHARE - an organization
that aims to eradicate homelessness -
have proved to be successful alterna-
tives to shelters.
The first major tent city in Seattle
began in 1990 when a group of home-
less individuals pitched an army tent
without permission on public land.
The group managed itself with demo-
cratically elected officers and no staff,

Fundraiser for
children's hospital
excels in fourth year
By RYANKARTJE
ManagingEditor
University of Michigan Athletic
Director David Brandon remembers
four years ago when the Champi-
ons for Children's Hearts Weekend
fundraiser was comprised of just a
tent, a golf outing and free food, led
by former football players Brian Gri-

ese and Steve Hutchinson.
Now in its fourth year and with
a third leader in former Heisman
Trophy winner Charles Woodson
joining the team, the event reached
new heights in its donations to Mott
Children's Hospital, eclipsing the $1
million mark. That far exceeds the
previous three events, which had
combined for a total of $1.2 million.
The greater amount of money
donated is due in part to the pro-
gram, which featured a silent and
live auction on Saturday night that
was hosted by ESPN personality
Mike Tirico.
"I never would've dreamed that

this would've raised over a million
dollars," Brandon said. "It's mind-
boggling that in just four years of
work that everyone could put some-
thing like this together."
Despite 2010 being Brandon's
first year at the helm of the Athletic
Department, he's no stranger to the
Champions for Children's Heart
Weekend. And since Brandon's twin
sons, Chris and Nick, were saved
shortly after birth by doctors at Mott
Hospital, the event functions as a
yearly reminder for him of what's
important in life.

University could see
limits on construction
financing options
By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
One federal legislator could be
gearing up to take aim at an impor-
tant financing mechanism that many
schools use to finance construction
projects on their campuses.
Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said
recently that he was concerned with
the findings of a government study
that examined, among other things,
the use of tax-exempt bonds by insti-
tutions of higher education.
"This report raises questions
for parents, students and taxpay-
ers about universities issuing bonds
and going into debt when they have
money in the bank," Grassley said in
a statement.
"Issuing bonds costs money on
interest and management fees," he
continued. "Does the expense of debt
service take money away from student
aid or academic service? Do bond issu-
ances occur even as universities raise
tuition and build investment assets?
These are fur-
ther questions to '
explore."
In arequestcfor
comment from >-'"
The Michigan-
Daily two weeks
ago, University KYLE SWANSON
spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said vng
he believed itA f
was too early to
comment on the senator's comments
because he hasn'tyetlaid out a propos-
al for revising the current tax-exempt
bond program.
"It's too soon to really speculate,"
Fitzgerald said of the implications a
change could have on the University.
Fitzgerald acknowledged that a
change to the current system could
affect the University, which uses
tax-exempt bonds for construction
projects on campus. However, he
emphasized that the University only
does so for construction projects. -
But University officials are no strang-
ers to Grassley's calls for reform in
higher education. The ranking minority
memberrofthe Senate Finance Commit-
tee has a reputation for examining the
financial management practices of non-
profits, like the University.

In 2008, Grassley criticized the
investment and spending practices of
universities across the country, call-
ing on them to spend a greater share of
their endowments.
At the time, Grassley told The New
York Times, "Tuition has gone up, col-
lege presidents' salaries have gone up,
and endowments continue to go up
and up. We need to start seeing tuition
relief for families go up just as fast."
However, his efforts created contro-
versy at the University, where University
President Mary Sue Coleman told The
Michigan Daily last year that she strong-
ly disagreed with Grassley's assessment.
Coleman told the Daily at the time
that she felt the University needed
to balance current demands against
planning for the future - a reason
why a limited payout from the endow-
ment would be in place.
That same message was echoed in
Coleman's response to Grassley and
his colleagues on the Senate Finance
Committee - which requested infor-
mation about the endowment invest-
ment and payout policies at 136
universities in the U.S.
"The University of Michigan has
a responsibility to diversify and
strengthen its financial base through
its endowment in order to maintain its
quality and accessibility in the face of
inflation, inevitable fluctuations in the
financial markets, and tightening state
and federal budgets," Coleman wrote
in a response letter to the committee
at the time.
After several months of review,
Grassley eventually backed down
from his calls for higher mandatory
endowment payouts.
But questions still remain as to
whether Grassley will pursue a simi-
lar campaign with reform of tax-
exempt bonds. He has not yet called
for any such reform publicly, saying
instead that the issue needs to be
explored further.
At least one leading industry expert
has told The Chronicle of Higher Edu-
cation that any campaign to restrict
access to funding for higher education
could be devastating in the current
economic climate.
"Now would be a very bad time to
make it more difficult for nonprofit
organizations in this country to bor-
row money," Charles Samuels, an
attorney for the National Association
of Health and Educational Facilities
Finance Authorities, told the Chron-
icle last week. "It isn't going to really
help the cost of higher education to
restrict financing."

Theoretical physicists
convene to discuss
Higgs boson
By ESHWAR
THIRUNAVUKKARASU
ManagingNewsEditor
With about 210,000 gallons of oil
spilling into the Gulf of MexicLess
than two months ago, the Large Had-
ron Collider - a particle accelerator
located in a 17-mile tunnel beneath
Switzerland and France - set the
world record for the highest-energy
particle collision. Many physicists
believe the feat marks a significant
step forward in discoveringthe origin
of all mass in the universe.
A three-day conference hosted by
The Michigan Center for Theoreti-
cal Physics recently brought together
theorists from around the world to
discuss the next step in finding the

elusive particle known as the Higgs
boson.
Aaron Pierce, University profes-
sor of physics and co-organizer of
the spring symposium, described the
Higgs boson as the particle which,
among other things, is theorized to
give mass to all other subatomic par-
ticles, such as electrons and protons.
"The Standard Model is a spectac-
ularly successful theory that explains
most of what we know about particle
physics so far," Pierce said. "There is
one piece missing, and that one piece
is a particle called the Higgs boson."
Pierce added that physicists have
long been unable to explain that pho-
tons - particles responsible for elec-
tricity and magnetism - are massless
while other particles with a defin-
able mass are capable of facilitating
processes like radioactive decay. The
Higgs boson, he said, could resolve
the mystery.

U' program-to
reduce hospital
re 1 ami ns
-a""""ion

New collaborative
targets patient health,
hospital resources
By DEVON THORSBY
Daily News Editor
Signed into law by President Barack
Obama earlier this year, the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act
is the centerpiece of the administra-
tion's agenda for health care reform.
However, concerns over the potential
financial burden imposed by the act's
provisions have led the legislation's
critics to question its feasibility.
But a new mentoring program for
physicians and hospitals could silence
critics by lowering the cost of health
care reform without compromising
universal coverage to all American
citizens.
Michigan Transitions of Care Col-
laborative - known as MTC2 - is a
system spearheaded by the University,
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan
and the Society of Hospital Medicine
that aims to improve the transition
from in-patient to out-patient care,
reducing patient re-admission to hos-
pitals.
Comprised of 15 physicians' organi-
zations and 14 partnering hospitals,
MTC2 is based on a system created
by the Society of Hospital Medicine,
called Project Better Outcomes for
Older Adults through Safer Transi-
tions, which focuses on the education
and development of medicine, spe-

cifically in a hospital setting.
Project BOOST, which aims to
improve the care of elderly patients
who move between hospitals and
their homes, began its pilot mentor-
ing program in fall 2008. Now imple-
mented in hospitals nationwide, the
program was initially designed to
reduce hospital re-admission rates
in the 30-day period after the ini-
tial release, improve communication
between in-patient and out-patient
facilities and increase patient satis-
faction.
David Share, the executive medi-
cal director of Blue Cross Blue Shield
of Michigan, said the collaboration
between the three institutions is
essential to the creation of a truly
interconnected health care system for
the state of Michigan.
"The reason we got involved was to
bring people together, to convene them
and set the stage," Share said. "(We
wanted) to help them work together
and to find the best approach."
Share said the Society of Hospi-
tal Medicine's work through Project
BOOST has worked to improve health
care systems by prioritizing both
patient health and reduced health care
costs.
"The hope is that people will take
the expertise that already exists and

the BOOST project in particular to
work together across hospitals to find
the best way to discharge people from
hospitals," Share said.
Accordingto Share, Blue Cross Blue
Shield has partnered with the Society
of Hospital Medicine fairly regularly
since 1997 on various multi-collabor-
ative projects, which were typically
focused on physician practices. In a
similar vein, MTC2 is designed to cre-
ate a better link between physicians'
practices and hospitals.
"There is a wide recognition that
there are problems with hand-offs,
with the hospital in-patient environ-
ment and the out-patient environ-
ment," he said.
Unplanned re-admission to hos-
pitals throughout the United States
costs Medicare $17.4 billion each year,
according to a May 13 Blue Cross Blue
Shield press release. The cost esti-
mates increase after consideration of
patient re-admission not covered by
Medicare.
Christopher Kim, program direc-
tor for MTC2 and clinical assistant
professor of internal medicine at the
University, said in a phone interview
on Friday that the goal of the col-
laboration is to streamline the use
of resources within the hospital to
improve the health of patients before
their release.
"When patients leave the hospital,
it's oftentimes considered a phase in
which patients still may have ongo-
ing needs," he said. "They need to get
back to their primary care provider in
a safe and easy way."
Kim said the work to organize the
collaborative began in the fall last
year, with calls to physicians' organi-
zations interested in participating in
the program.
In March of this year, the collab-

orative selected specific physicians'
organizations and partnering hospi-
tals from the applicant pool, focus-
ing on their abilities to implement
the program and represent different
regions of Michigan, according to
Kim.
Kim said the first training confer-
ence for the participating physicians'
organizations began this past Mon-
day, consisting of two days of educa-
tion seminars led by experts from the
Society of Hospital Medicine.
"The goal of this collaborative is to
learn together, to provide better, safer
and more quality care throughout
Michigan," said Kim.
Kim added that the next phase of
MTC2 will likely begin this winter or
early next year.
"We certainly do hope that other
organizations throughout the state
will want to be part of this collabora-
tive," Kim said.
Share said if the program is proper-
ly implemented, it could not only make
the health care system more efficient
but also sufficient.
"People won't fall through the
cracks," Share said. "They won't get
sick afterwards, they won't miss
follow-up appointments and they'll
overall be healthier after receiving the
treatment they need."
While other mentoring programs
have been developed in the past to
improve medical systems, Kim said
MTC2 is the first to apply to both phy-
sicians' care and hospitals on a large
scale.
"This is a very unique thing about
the state of Michigan," he said. "As far
as we know, there are no other states
that are doing this. We feel we can
pave the way and show how this can
be done in a successful way...through-
out the country."

Coming up short on safety
City shouldn't cut police and fire departments more
The last thing someone wants to worry about when their home
catches fire or a burglar breaks in at night is whether the city
has enough firefighters and police officers to help. But depend-
ing on the outcome of today's City Council annual budget meeting, that
this fear may be warranted. With these vital services already suffer-
ing from massive cuts - the Ann Arbor police force has shrunk by 35
percent since 2001, according to AnnArbor.com - the city simply can't
afford more. City Council must stave off further downsizing of its police
and fire departments and plug its budget gaps by other means.

By the time you read this, the City
Council's budget vote may be over.
On Monday, the Council will finalize
its $78 million general fund budget
for fiscal 2011, which runs from July
1st of this year until June 30th, 2011.
During budget time each year,
the city administrator presents the
Council with a budget proposal that
includes a variety of increases and
reductions - recently, more reduc-
tions than many of us would want.
Over the last decade, the city gov-
ernment has reorganized its staff
and reduced the number of people
it employs. But this hasn't always
resulted in a more efficient, less
expensive city government, even
though that was the original goal.
Today, the Council will vote on
amendments to the administrator's
budget, and the end result will be
one that is balanced. This year, that
balance will be achieved by dipping
into the city's reserves for $1.5 mil-
lion. Getting to that balanced budget
should have been the result of a lot
of hard, dedicated work by members
of the Council and the staff, working
together on behalf of the people of
Ann Arbor. But in reality, whatever
work was done on the budget didn't
happen in the City Council's budget
committee, on which I serve, and it
didn't happen in the six extra working
sessions the Council has held since
January. I'm not certain where this
work actually happened,sexcept the
woirk I did myself This is my fourth
budget season on City Council, and
this year I received a lot of prelimi-
nary information. Unfortunately, the
process still leaves me perplexed.
A big part of this year's budget
discussions have dealt with the pos-
sibility of cuts to safety personnel.
For a while, the city government has
played chicken with its safety service
union negotiations. I'm no involved
in contract negotiations - no mem-
ber of Council is - so I have no idea
what's needed to get to a final agree-
ment. I only know that we on City
Council and in the public hear that
layoffs may be necessary; they may
be imminent; they will (or will not)
damage the city's ability to provide
a reasonable level of security to our
citizens. And then, at the last minute,

someone blinks. Someone agrees to
something. Last year, it was retire-
ments. This year the city found addi-
tional funding. And today, the City
Council will likely approve a budget
that does not lay off any police staff
and reduces the firefighting staff by
only five firefighters (and since one
of those positions is already vacant,
maybe only by four).
To get the budget to this point, the
city received funding from the Down-
town Development Association's park-
ing fund ($2 million); readjusted its
estimate of State Shared Revenue on
the advice of its paid lobbyist in Lan-
sing; made some assumptions about
the collection of parking fines and
locked the Council into a new parking
fine structure; and postponed the pur-
chase of firefighting equipment.
But not everyone is happy. Every-
where in Michigan, people have been
talking about money for well. over
a year. As both the country and the
state of Michigan have gone through
a massive economic downturn, Ann
Arbor's economy has weathered the
storm comparatively well. Despite
this relative success, people are still
frustrated.
Perhaps it's because people are
questioning the priorities used to
make decisions for the budget. From
labor to parks to human services to
parades, everyone in Ann Arbor and
on the Council wants to fund every-
thing. While one problem is obvi-
ously the lack of money, there also
isn't a good set of guidelines that the
Council and the public understand
and agree on to help make these
decisions. Tempers flare during the
debate over priorities, and it's eas-
ier to fix things temporarily than to
solve the underlying problems.
Next year's budget won't be any
better. We haven't changed the fun-
damental way we look at the city
or the way we do business. Playing
chicken with unions and rescuing
popular programs at the last minute
with sudden budget changes haven't
helped. Instead, they have failed to
define the essential structure needed
to make hard decisions in the future.

representative for the First Ward.

For months, City Council
has been discussing budget
plans for the next fiscal year
and how to best cope with the
revenue shortfalls. According
to AnnArbor.com, if a budget
agreement can't be reached by
today, the city will follow a bud-
get recommendation plan that
was initially proposed by City
Administrator Roger Fraser.
His recommendations, which
include cutting 20 positions
from both the fire department
and police department, are set
to take effect in July of this year.

Positive incentives

ELAINE MORTON

E-MAIL ELAINEAT EMORT@UMICH.EDU.

L et's play a word associa-
tion game: I'll say a word
and you shout out whatever
comes to your
mind. Ready:
"Economics."
If you are like
many of my non-
economics major
friends, you prob-
ably responded
with words like ERIC
"money," "sup- STULBERG
ply and demand," STULBERG
"Wall Street," etc.
I can almost guarantee that you did
not respond with "spring term and
summer term."
Spring term and summer term
are surprisingly good examples of
how economics works. Economics
isn't only the study of money and
graphs. It is the study - actually
the complex science - of cause and
effect. In economics, we replace
the word "cause" with the fancy-
sounding terms like "incentive"
and "disincentive." So let's analyze
the "incentives" for and effects of
spring and summer term.
In order for spring and summer
term to exist, students must want to
take classes. In economics, that is
demand. There aremanyincentives
for students to take spring and sum-
mer classes. Ann Arbor has a great
vibe in spring and summer and
students want to stay here to enjoy
a more kicked-back atmosphere. A
student with a double-major may
need to fulfill requirements. Per-
haps a student wants to take one
hard class by itself.
Courses also need professors.
Professors and GSIs supply the
service demanded by students,
teaching us during the spring and
summer in order to boost their
income. The University pays pro-
fessors and GSIs to teach so it can
make money from students' tuition.
And students are willing to pay
tuition for all of the incentives men-
tioned earlier. It's one giant win-
win cycle of overlapping incentives.
Each of these incentives have
specific effects on the Ann Arbor
area. The academic community -
students, faculty and administra-
tors - remaining in Ann Arbor is
an added boon to the local hous-
ing market and business establish-
ments. Many spring and summer
students sublet housing from other
students. If year-round students
couldn't find subletters for the
spring and summer, they may not
have leased housing for the year.
If it weren't for students subletting
in the spring and summer, the off-
campus housing market would be

negatively affected.
Local restaurants and supermar-
kets continue to ring up sales and
benefit from traffic generated by
those staying in Ann Arbor. This
traffic is an important buffer to
business establishments that would
otherwise suffer from an exodus of
students and faculty.

businesses.
These students and faculty
pump up other local businesses
with their disposable money. For
example, in the past week I've
bought a used textbook from
Ulrich's and an extension cord
from Target and saw a movie at
the Michigan Theater. My contri-
butions to those businesses alone
don't have much of an effect. But
even if a quarter of all students
taking spring term and summer
term courses buy their textbooks
from Ulrich's, spend money at local
stores and occasionally indulge by
going to the movie theater, it is
easy to see how these students are
vital to the local economy.
And as much as I like spending
money, I like to earn it even more.
This is probably true for many stu-
dents. As a result, students support
the University and local businesses
by providingthe ideal type of labor:
educated, eager and cheap. One of
my friends is assisting a professor
with cancer research for a mere
eight dollars an hour. Only in a col-
lege town could a cancer researcher
find an educated, productive assis-
tant who is willingto work for bare-
ly above minimum wage.
However you slice or dice it,
spring and summer terms are a
win-win for local businesses, stu-
dents and the University. Students
gain knowledge, course credits and
jobs. The University gains tuition
money and its researchers gain a
labor pool of the best workers in the
state. Businesses, too, have access
to that same labor pool and ben-
efit from the money students infuse
into the local economy.
Let's play the word associa-
tion game one last time. Ready:
"Spring and summer term." I bet
that you either said "last week's
miserable, rainy weather" or,
hopefully, "economics."

you see the usual marks of

But then you
see something
else: an explo- NICHOLAS
sion in the ocean. CLIFT
You notice a huge
slick of oil fed by a
leak that is spilling 210,000 gallons
every day, according to the Associ-
ated Press. Like ants trying to stop a
flood, you see the natives in fishing
boats making futile attempts to keep
the spill from spreading. You notice
others trying to plug a leak almost a
mile under the water's surface, and
failing. And then, on shore, you see
billions of people consuming oil like
addicted teenagers consume alco-
hol, oblivious to the harm it's caus-
ing, yet unable to stop. You'd think
humans were idiots.
And you'd be right - we're clearly
being foolish. The whole oil spill
fiasco has been a catastrophic com-
bination of failures. There was the
mechanical failure that started the
whole thing and caused the deaths
of 11 workers. There's the continuing
failure of BP and the federal govern-
ment to shut the gushing well down.
But these technological failures are
really just symptoms of a more dire
problem: our addiction to oil.
We need to take a moment, as
a nation, to look at ourselves in
the mirror. We have a problem. In
so many ways, our oil habit looks
extraordinarily like a drug addic-
tion, and it's slowly robbing us of the

great person we used to be. We've
gained some weight. Our behavior's
been sporadic. Some of our friends
are avoiding us, and our eyes look
bloodshot. We go to parties, but
nobody wants to dance with us.
Well, maybe that lastbit's just me.
Carbon dioxide, a byproduct of
burning fossil fuels is slowly poison-
ing our climate beyond recognition.
Even with no major spills, hundreds
of millions of gallons of oil each
year, much of it runoff from roads
and spills from routine mainte-
nance, find their way to the oceans,
causing environmental damage. We
get much of our oil from countries
that are openly hostile toward us.
We're willing to drill tens of thou-
sands of feet into the rock beneath
an ocean to have our precious oil.
The lesson, for us and our gov-
ernment, is simple: the oil addiction
must end.
On Wednesday, Senators John
Kerry (D-Mass.) and Joe Lieberman
(I-Conn.) unveiled the energy and
climate bill they'd been negotiat-
ing and amending for the last eight
months. In it are plans to reduce
the national reliance on foreign oil
and cut greenhouse gas emissions
83 percent by 2050. For our country,
this is rehab. Still, many are say-
ing that the bill has little chance of
passing within the year.
While America is resisting rehab,
China, the kid America picked on in
middle school, is showing us up. A
photo essay in the May/June issue of
MIT Technology Review reported
that last year China's investment in
clean(ish) energy surpassed that of
America's for the first time ever, as
the country spent $34.6 billion to
clean up its air. China is also build-
ing 22 new nuclear reactors with a
combined power output of 23 giga-

watts, or the equivalent of the power
supplied by about 7,600 of the largest
wind turbines on a very windy day.
The country has just completed the
first offshore wind farm to be built
outside of Europe, and it's adding
considerably to its use of hydropow-
er. China boasts the world's largest
manufacturer of crystalline silicon
photovoltaic solar cells and it's kick-
ing our butt in developing a clean
energy economy. America is being
left inebriated in the corner as the
world advances around us.
Our nation needs
to put an end to its
oil addiction.
-But I don't want America to be
that kid who everyone thought
was gifted in middle school but
hung out with the wrong crowd
and blew everything on drugs. We
have great minds and resources, as
evidenced by our own University.
With a strong but wisely set cap
and trade policy, the government
can make the price of carbon more
accurately reflect the toll fossil fuels
exact from society. We can end our
addiction and take back our techno-
logical superiority. America can be
the funny, attractive, successful kid
it once was, but only if it's willing
to check itself into rehab and give
up its addiction. Otherwise, China
will very soon be stealing America's
class presidency, its lunch money
and probably its girlfriend.

what you don't forget," Brandon said.
"That's what keeps me motivated to
do what I can to help out."
The new Mott Children's Hospital,
which will include the new Von Voigt-
landerWomen's Hospital, is scheduled
to open in 2012, and with the contin-
ued fundraisers launched by Michigan
athletic alumni - eight others have
taken place across the country since
January - events such as the Cham-
pions for Children's Heart Weekend
should play a significant role in com-
pleting the hospital project.
For Brandon, that significant
effect comes as no surprise.
"Over the last three or four years,
we've formalized this connection
between Michigan athletics and
Mott in a way that we can really raise
a lot of money," Brandon said. "Not
only are we helping the kids, sign-
ing autographs and giving them that
time and attention, now we're giving
them time and resources and we're
helping build the new hospital."

versity professor of physics and co-
organizer of the symposium, said the
conference provides a timely response
to the recent developments at the
LHC.
"It's the first time in history that
we're able to get direct experimental
access to what gives mass to elemen-
tary particles," he said.
Wells said that as an institution
that has "traditionally been extremely
strong in particle physics," the Uni-
versity of Michigan is a key player in
the discussion of the Higgs boson.
He added that the University's strong
global reputation makes it an ideal
forum for researchers to collaborate
and share ideas.
Joey Huston, a physics professor at
Michigan State University, was one of
more than 60 conference attendees.
Huston, who said he communicates
with his team in Geneva at the LHC,
added that he also collaborates with
theorists from the University of Mich-
igan to interpret data from the LHC in
Switzerland and the Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory based near
Chicago.
"We're exploring a new energy
range (at the LHC), and whenever
that happens you almost always find
something unexpected," he said.
"It's not the case that if we produce
one of these Higgs bosons that a

athletics is something that's been
consistent in Ann Arbor for most of
the program's history - even in a
time when the program has felt the
heat of the national spotlight.
"Michigan football has been
around for 130 years," Hutchinson
said. "Because they've had a couple
years they're not particularly proud
of has no reflection on this tourna-
ment or this family. To get guys that
have played spanning four decades,
that just speaks volumes to how
strong that bond is."
With the team in the midst of
NCAA allegations and back-to-back
losing seasons under coach Rich
Rodriguez, many former players
spoke about that bond. And Wood-
son, who played at the University
from 1995-97, said that Rodriguez
has continued the tradition of giving
back in his two seasons in Ann Arbor.
"It's a family," Woodson said.
"In my opinion, (Rodriguez) has
(embraced that tradition). This is
what Michigan is all about. It's about
supporting each other, supporting
this university. And we're letting him
know that we support him. When
it comes to this event, he's a part of
it, and he's understanding what this
culture is about. Now, we just want
him to win."
siren goes off or a bell starts ring-
ing. It's very tricky to do the kind
of analysis to be able to say that we
definitely have it."
Huston,who was given a bottle of
champagne as a gift for delivering
lectures at Fermilab, said the LHC
particle collision in March was an
important milestone - one worth
celebrating. Though the data collect-
ed in the next few years will be criti-
cal to the search for the Higgs boson,
the total amount of information will
dwarf the initial findings, he said.
"Right now, (researchers at the
LHC) are taking things slowly and
cautiously, increasing the intensity of
the collisions as they start to under-
stand the machine better and better,"
he said.
Huston said he believes the data
collected over the next decade may
not only uncover the truth underly-
ing the Higgs boson but also provide
insight into other physical dimensions
not normally perceived in everyday
life.
Pierce echoed Huston's sentiments,
adding that the work being done at
Fermilab and at the LHC could answer
some of the fundamental questions
long asked by physicists.
"People are explorers, and we
have a long history of exploring,"
Pierce said. "This is part of that his-
tory. We're trying to understand more
about the Universe around us, asking
some basic questions (about) how it all
works."

eventually growing to between 150

SHARE to educate communities
about homelessness and empowering
the homeless.
A second Seattle tent city started
in 1998, again on public land without
permission. But while members of
the camp were at City Hall negotiat-
ing their right to stay on the land, the
camp was bulldozed off of a cliff.
Lantz Rowland, a resident of the
third tent city to be created, said one
of the major advantages of a tent city
over a shelter is its flexible hours,
especially for residents who work a
graveyard shift.
"People can come and go as they
please. We can take people day or
night," he said. "Contrary to popu-
lar opinion...we have people who do
work."
Rowland also emphasized the
importance of having a place to keep
one's personal belongings, especially
when going for job interviews.
"I don't have to carry everything
I own on my back," he said. "And the
I Online at Mihionetailvscom

stuff that's in my tent is protected by
my neighbors."
Just as the tent cities in Seattle
offer homeless individuals an alter-
native to the overtaxed shelters, CTN
wants to offer a similar option for
Ann Arbor's growing homeless popu-
lation.
According to the Washtenaw
County Office of Community Devel-
opment, the number of homeless
people in the county has grown from
3,940 in 2006 to 4,618in2009.
Ellen Schulmeister, executive
director of The Shelter Association of
Washtenaw County, said people who
make less than 15 dollars an hour will
struggle to house themselves in Ann
Arbor.
These days, Schulmeister said, it
is especially difficult for homeless
individuals to land even the lowest-
paying jobs.
"They say there's something like
six applications for every job. Our
person is number six - they used
to be maybe number three, but now
they're number six," she said. "You've
got students and people with degrees
and better work histories ahead of
them now competing for lower-pay-
ing jobs and lower-skilled jobs just
because they are desperate to find a
job."
Food Gatherers, a food bank and
resource program in Washtenaw
County, and Feed America, a national
hunger relief organization, reported
in a study released in February that
43,900 people in the county use Food
Gatherers' emergency food services
- a 138-percent increase since 2006.

The report also found that 39 per-
cent of households in Washtenaw
County that use the Food Gather-
ers' emergency food services have to
choose between paying their rent or
mortgage and buying food, and 26
percent of client households have one
working adult, down from 41 percent
in 2006.
Schulmeister said the statistics
from the Food Gatherers and Feed
America study indicate that the
number of homeless individuals in
Washtenaw County will continue to
rise, which is no surprise, she said,
considering the current state of the
economy.
"There isn't a community that
I know of that has enough shelter
beds," Schulmeister said. "It's very
hard to have a shelter bed for every-
body who needs one."
The Delonis Center in downtown
Ann Arbor has 75 beds for individual
adults. In the winter, the shelter pro-
vides an additional 25 beds through
a rotating church shelter and sets up
35 to 40 yoga mats in its dining room.
According to Schulmeister, there are
still between 200 and 300 additional
people who need shelter on any given
night.
Schulmeister said she understands

An Argentine art form in Ann Arbor

'U'club turns students,
townies into tango-ers
By EMMA JESZKE
ManagingArts Editor
For many, summertime in Ann
Arbor means front porch-frequenting
with cold beverages, little-to-no class
and trying not to suffocate under
the humid blanket that is Michigan
summer. But amidst the chilled-out
leftover students and re-emerging
townies is agroup of people who, twice
a week, flock to the basement of Angell
Hall to turn up the heat even further.
The Michigan Argentine Tango
Club (MATC) is a sexy slice of nation-
ally recognized talent that is open
to all, regardless of 'U' affiliation.
Through the combination of chem-
istry between group members and
pheromones zipping through the air,
MATC creates a magnetic energy that
pulsates through the hallway where its
shockingly affordable dance lessons
take place.
As the women glide in strappy
high-heeled shoes, hand-in-hand with
wide-smiling male partners, stopping
to exchange affections with nearly
every couple they pass, it's pretty clear
that these people are here together to

share in their passion: They all abso-
lutely love to tango.
"What's cool about (MATC) is,
because it's an all-volunteer club and
there's no competition, we all help
each other - it's a very friendly envi-
ronment," said Patrick Lademan, an
MATC member since 2002 and cur-
rent beginner series instructor.
None of the instructors working
with the group are in it for a paycheck.
Instead, after working their way up,
they feel it is enough of a reward to
pass on their tango skills to newbies.
Because literally everything in the club
is done on a volunteer basis, MATC is
successful in its aim to provide low-
cost tango lessons to students and
townies (it's $20 for an 8-week pass for
students, $30 for non-students). Drop-
ins can pay a special rate for just one
class.
"Because we are volunteer-run, all
we are trying to do is pay our expens-
es, which are just the room costs,
things like equipment and bringing
well-known instructors to big festi-
vals," said Elizabeth Garcia, a 2004
LSA graduate and former MATC vice
president.
Solveig Heinz, a fourth year Ph.D.
candidate in LSA who has been
involved with MATC in various capac-
ities for four years, feels that keeping

MATC members get fancy for milongoas, tango parties held every other Saturday.

the club in the hands of those willing
to work and teach for free creates a
sense of community that would not
exist otherwise.
"We learn it together and we give to
each other and we teach each other,"
Heinz said.

an advanced beginner class. "You are

want."
Along with keeping the tango
environment friendly and affordable,
MATC strives to make the dance
accessible, to make even the most
clumsy-footed klutzes feelcapable.
"Our club in particular really tries
to stay true to the roots of Argentin-
eantangojust keepingitas this street
dance that's for anybody," Garcia
said. "There are other forms of tango
that are more polished, that are more
flashy, which are fine and totally valid
but our club generallysticks to how
it originated."
"'Dancingwiththe Stars' makes all
of us nauseous, actually," Pal added.
Tango-ers get an intimate twist on
experiencing cultural diversity here
at the University.
"The club is, I would guess, about

70 percent international," Heinz said.
"If you look at the board, you have
everything from Lebanon to Germany
... I just taught with someone who is
Chinese. And it's the idea that you are
so close - literally, physically so close
- to a complete stranger, and that's
often not part of our cultures at all.
And you have this moment you share,
with the music, ten minutes, and then:
'Thank you.'
"When you say 'thank you' in tango,
it mteans 'I'm done,' " she added. "You
say it, and then you smile and walk off
- oh, it's divine."
Lademan emphasized MATC's
focus on a "homogeneous community
of people who all dance together,"
whether dating, single or married.
"Dinesh is married and has a child
and I'm engaged and pregnant, but
when we dance tango, we'reglike this,"
Heinz said - before grabbing Pal to
strike a fabricated pose of passion-rid-
den tango.
"And that's the beauty of it," she
added.

Drawing out the secret

We got these hipster bitches wrapped around our finger.
Semisweet 'Treats'

By ARTHUR VELEZ
Daily Arts Writer
Rising from beneath the ever-
saturated waters of today's
indie-band
blogosphere is
no easy task.
Whether due to .
the sheer volume
of music being Treats
written or the NSEE.T
Internet's murky
conglomeration
of media outlets, it seems that
most bands are destined for the
shadows before ever making that
first MySpace page.
That being said, in the quest to
be heard, it is certainly helpful to
have an established artist on your
side. So, having recently signed
to M.I.A.'s own label, N.E.E.T.
Recordings, noise-pop band Sleigh
Bells has nowhere to go but up.
On the surface, the latest act
to be vaulted from Brooklyn's
ever-teeming music scene seems
destined only for its 15 minutes
of fame. Comprised of guitarist/
producer Derek Miller (formerly
of Poison the Well) and pop vocal-
ist Alexis Krauss, Sleigh Bells is an
unlikely duo, but one that uses its
potential shortcomings as creative
fuel.
After the first listen, Treats,
the band-of-the-moment's debut
album, is, in a word, volatile.
Clocking in at just under 35 min-
utes, this 11-track LP sets its blis-
teringpace from theveryfirst drop
of the bass. Album opener and lead
single "Tell 'Em" is bathed in dis-
torted guitar. Its heavy bass drum
hits pound so strongly that by the
time Krauss's cooing vocals enter,
it feels as though she is a child in
a thunderstorm, still too naive to

see the danger.
The band continues at this
aggressive rate until doing a sty-
listic 180 with the summery "Rill
Rill." This both acts as a necessary
interlude from the frenzied punk
feel of the album and - for once
- gives Krauss's feathery vocals
center stage. As she repeats the
line "Have a heart" behind a lush
soundscape of affected guitars, it
becomes obvious that Sleigh Bells
doesn't simply hide behind distor-
tion, but can occasionally use it to
create truly beautiful pop music.
This duo exemplifies how, musi-
cally, opposites sometimes do
synthesize and go on to produce
decent work. In terms of genre,
these two hail from directional
extremes, but Miller's experimen-
tal songwriting brings their sound
into cohesion. From ubiquitous
handclaps, to the use of actual
sleigh bells, Treats is an interest-
ing juxtaposition of angular, hard-
core guitar work, club-ready beats
in the vein of M.I.A. and bubble-
gum vocals with a tinge of angst.
Sleigh Bells ring
with bo-fi spirit.
Though repetitious and at some
points a bit too abrasive, Treats
is for the most part a success-
ful effort from a unique tandem.
With all of the hype surrounding
this album, it's easy to get swept
into the hipster bandwagon. But in
reality, this is a solid effort from a
fledgling band that might actually
have staying power - not merely
those 15 minutes of Internet star-
dom.

Daily Arts Writer
The biggest surprise of the past year's
Academy Awards wasn't the triumph of
Kathryn Bigelow or the ominous inclu-
sion of "The Blind Side"*
to the Best Picture line-
up. Rather, it was the The $ecret
nomination of a little
Irish film known as of Kells
"The Secret of Kells,"A
which had barely any
screenings to its name, Michigan
in the Animated Fea- GKIDS
ture Film category.
The question at the tip of everybody's
tongues became: What was the Acad-
emy thinking?
Yet once "Kells" emerged quietly
onto the moviehouse scene, audiences
understood. In a year where 3-D glasses
and grand IMAX screenings dominated
the box office, one can't help but feel
that the Academy members who voted
for "Kells" were on to something - a
form of silent rebellion against all things
big and explosive.
"The Secret of Kells" finds young
Brendan (newcomer Evan McGuire)
living behind the walls of the Abbey of
Kells, guarded aggressively by his uncle
Abbot Cellach (Brendan Gleeson, "In
Bruges"). As Brendan befriends master
illuminator Brother Aidan (Mick Lally,
"Alexander"), he stumbles upon The
Book of Kells, a religious manuscript
with the most intricate hand-drawn
paintings ever seen. In what becomes
a classic brawn-versus-art showdown,
Brendan ventures deep into the Gaelic
underbelly of the forest searching for
ink, feathers and a glass eye, encounter-
ing a few mysteries on the way.
TANGO
From Page 8
MATC keeps busy with much
more than the bi-weekly dance les-
sons. Each year, the group organizes
three national (and sometimes inter-
national) festivals that are basically a
72-hour "tango bubble," according to
Heinz, as well as three smaller-scale
workshops with guest instructors.
Earlier this month, a festival enti-
tled "May Madness" brought Buenos
Aires tango professional couple Ari-
adna Naveira and Fernando Sanchez
and fellow professional Eriqueta
Kleinman to campus. MATC's festi-
vals attract tango-ers from all over the
country - and sometimes even attract
dancers from abroad.
"It sounds really snobby, but I would
say Ann Arbor is very well known (in
the larger tango world)," Heinz said.

It's rare that the visual components of
a film can completely saturate its entire
being. Indeed, the Irish fairytale story-
line seems to exist wholly for the sump-
tuous drawings depicting it. A flighty
little nymph sprite, with her white hair
blowing spiritedly in the wind, guides
ribbons of smoke along the geometric
curlicues of the screen. Armed with
nothing but a pencil, Brendan battles
fearsome villains as he catapults him-
self within a milky plasmatic nebula.
And then there are the montages: some
whimsical, like filigreed clockwork,
some impressionistic, like a smudgy
Renoir painting, and some brilliantly
naturalistic - think jeweled leaves with
verdure smeared all over the surface.
Yet although "Kells" features scenes
heavily laden with Irish mysticism and
subversively Pagan rituals, the film
could essentially double as a social
allegory for the modern film industry.
Brother Aidan says dishearteningly to
Cellach: "You've forgotten how impor-
tant it is. All you want forus is this wall!"

Just replace "it" with "hand-drawing"
and "wall" with "hyper-explosive 3-D
graphics," and you've got yourself the
perfect antidote to James Cameron and
his devoted followers.
Quick, put on your
2-D glasses.
With a runtime of little more than an
hour, "Kells" is a refreshingly different
take on classic animation, lovingly and
defiantly flattened into two dimensions.
It's inspiringly simple and more than
a little trippy. By paying homage to an
ancient time where beauty and patience
inevitably won out over brute force, the
film blends a straightforward moral-
ity with sophisticated hand-draw-
ings to stunning visual effect. Truly,
"The Secret of Kells" practices what it
preaches.

"You look magically delicious, and I just happen to be a cereal lovemaker."

"Which is why it's so cool to organize
a festival. People are just drawn to us,
because they know the quality of dance
is really high, but our tickets for these
festivals are literally a sixth sometimes
of what tickets are elsewhere."
"We advertise (for our festivals) all
over, and we have dancers from all
over the country, outside of the coun-
try, come and dance with us," Garcia
said. "It's a total mixing pot of all these
different, amazing people. And we try
to host as many of the out-of-towners
as possible in our own homes, to try
and reduce their costs."
Aside from the larger festivals and
workshops, the group also organizes
milongas - or dance parties - every
other Saturday. Sometimes the milon-
gas have special themes for outreach
efforts - last summer, the group part-
nered with the LGBT community and
held a "Rainbow Tango." It has also
been raising money for earthquake

relief in Haiti since Valentine's Day,
when it threw a milonga with proceeds
all allotted to Haiti.
The group is still accepting dona-
tions for Haiti. Proceeds from pro-
spective events will continually be
sent to Haiti medical support group
"Partners in Health." Their goal is to
raise at least $2,010 throughout the
course of the year.
Garcia commented that even
though the act of tango doesn't direct-
ly relate to MATC's philanthropic
efforts, group members enjoy using
their time spent together to benefit a
larger cause.
"Often I feel like (tango) is the
central answer to a very rational life
that we lead, you know, with Ph.D.
and master's and bachelor's degrees,"
Heinz added.
"And the only way that this is possi-
ble is that everybody does everything
for free."

Blue secures Sweet 16 berth

By MATT KRASNOFF
Daily Sports Writer
Second chances are something that
everyone wants but so few people
actually get.
But this weekend, senior Tania
Mahtani got a second chance to play
her final home match.
Three weeks ago, the third-ranked
Wolverines held Senior Day when
they hosted their final regular sea-
son match. Mahtani - the team's lone
senior - was honored, and found suc-
cess on what was a very emotional day
for her.
Little did she know that Michigan
would get to host two rounds of the
NCAA regional for the first time in the
program's history, and that she would
get to play at home once again as the
Wolverines swept through the region-
als to advance to the Sweet 16.
"It was a huge honor (to get another
home match)," Mahtani said. "It was
one of our goals throughout the year
to host a regional, so it was just really
exciting to get to play on our home
courts."
The Wolverines dominated their
firstround match against Illinois-Chi-
cago, winning 4-0.
Michigan then faced rival Ohio
State on Saturday in the second round,
but the familiar foe proved to be no
match for the Wolverines.
Michigan won by another 4-0 mar-
gin, although the second round match
proved much tougher than the sweep
on Friday.
"We know Ohio State pretty well,
and they're a great group of competi-
tors so we knew we had our work cut

out for us," Michigan coach Ronni
Bernstein said. "We're just happy we
could come through."
With each team winning one of
the first two doubles matches, it came
down to the number-one doubles
match. Juniors Whitney Taney and
Rika Tatsuno went up 6-0 in the eight-
game pro set, but Ohio State's Kelsey
Haviland and Cami Hubbs battled
back to make it 7-5.
With Ohio State to serve, Taney and
Tatsuno took a step back to prepare
for what they knew would be the final
game.
The duo of juniors won four straight
points to win the match.
"After losing those few games we
just needed to loosen up and have a
laugh," Taney said. "Then after that
we just played a great game and we're

lucky to get the win."
Mahtani secured the second singles
victory and third overall point for
the Wolverines. After a tough loss in
doubles and a rough start to singles
- she lost the first set 6-4 - Mahtani
won the final two sets and lost just two
games in the process.
"It's a team sport, and we still got
the doubles point so she just needed to
forget about it," Bernstein said. "She's
the lone senior and to pull out a win
during her last time at the Varsity
Tennis Center is great."
Junior Denise Muresan - the No.
19 singles player in the country and
Mahtani's doubles partner - clinched
the match with her win in the No. 1
spot.

The Wolverines beat
No. 3 Arizona State in
Denver, Colorado on
Saturday night
By BOBBY REEDY
Daily Sports Writer
For the third straight year, the
MCLA National Tournament ended
with Michigan hoisting the trophy.
On Saturday night in Denver,
Colorado under the bright lights of
Dick's Sporting Goods Park, the No.1
Wolverines celebrated after winning
the National Championship 12-11
over No. 3 Arizona State.
When thinking of the program
Michigan coach John Paul and
his coaching staff have assembled
in Ann Arbor, the word dynasty
comes to mind these days With four
straight conference titles and, more
importantly, three straight national
championships (and just one loss in
those three seasons), the Wolverines
have put together one of the greatest
runs in MCLA history.
"A lot of people were throwing that
term (dynasty) out last night," junior
attackman Trevor Yealy said. "I
would be reluctant to call ita dynas-
ty because myself and a lot of oth-
ers still have another year to go, and
we wouldn't want to jinx ourselves.

(Coach) Paul and (his staff) have put
together an amazing program and I
don't think it would be bad to call it
a dynasty. It's a pretty fitting title for
three in a row, and hopefully we can
keep running with it."
The junior class would like to
cement its place as the greatest to
ever to come through the program,
but that title currently belongs to the
outgoing seniors. They have com-
piled a sterling 71-6 record during
their tenure.
"(The senior class) started with 13
of them and 12 are graduating and
that's a great number (because) that
many of them stuck around," Paul
said. "It's a testament to these guys
that they embraced the changes we
made in the program, and they have
been such a big part of our success
over the last three years."
Peaking on May 15 was something
the team spoke of all year, and the
Wolverines definitely focused on fly-
ing out of the gates to start the game.
But the first quarter certainly
didn't seem that way. The Sun Dev-
ils struck first blood within the first
minute of play. A back-and-forth
period saw Michigan down 5-4 at its
end.
"A lot of (the sloppy play) was first-
quarter jitters," Yealy said. "A couple
(of Arizona State's) goals were just
unfortunate... on one of them we had
a defender fall down and slip on the
wet grass."

Blue finishes in sixth place at NCAAs

By JAMES BLUM
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's water polo
team had high hopes of sending off
senior captain Leah Robertson and
fifth-year senior goalkeeper Brittany
May with a deep tournament run.
But the players saw those hopes
dashed halfway through their quar-
terfinal against No. 4 seed California
(26-9) on Friday.
After staying with the high-pow-
ered Golden Bear offense in the first
period, the Wolverines (33-8) fell
apart in the second stanza, as they
were outscored 4-0.
The usually smothering Michi-
gan defense showed its youthfulness,
allowing California to open up a 7-2
lead at the half. Freshman goalie Alex
Adamson, who won the job from an
injury-plagued May, didn't look like
her regular-season self.
Adamson's struggles on the big
stage forced coach Matt Anderson to
platoon the net with all three goalies.
Adamson, freshman Morgan Turner
and a fatigued May all saw significant

ment.
Adamson and May combined for 14

The second quarter was vital for
the Wolverines in turning the game
around. ASU had its goalie, Dylan
*Westfall, to thank for keeping the
team in the game - Westfall made
eight saves in a period which saw
Michigan outshoot the Sun Devils 19
to three.
After dominating the Sun Devils in
the second, the Wolverines took a 6-5
lead into the half.
"Our attack this year was the deep-
est I think we have ever been," Yealy
said. "We had at least five guys who
all contributed a lot of points. And we
just kind of meshed well. You could
put any combination of us on the field

offensively, putting up a hat trick. She
tallied four against California and fin-
ished with eight over the three-game
tournament. The blowout win placed
the Wolverines in the familiar fifth-
place game against top-ranked UCLA
(22-8).
Once again, the Michigan defense
struggled early against the Bruins
on Sunday afternoon, allowing six
first-period goals. This lack of con-
centration dug the Wolverines an
insurmountable hole, and despite
outscoring UCLA over the final three
stanzas, Michigan lost 9-6 to end its
impressive season with a disappoint-
ing sixth-place finish.
"We wanted more," Anderson said.
"But we had two bad quarters - a bad
quarter against Cal and a bad quarter
against UCLA.
"And when you're playing the No. 1
team in the nation and the No. 4 team
in the nation, you can't afford to have
a bad quarter. We're happy with our
season, but not happy with how we
played this weekend. But to finish
sixth is a lot better than to not make
it this far."
Left with the bitter aftertaste of
disappointment, the Wolverines were
forced to say goodbye to four seniors
- May, Robertson, Terri Bukofzer and
Casie Kelly.
"It's very emotional," Anderson

nothing is gong to surprise us. We're

'M' rallies to clinch series Blue grabs Big Ten title

Wolverines win rubber
match with Wildcats
after falling down
14-0, win in extras
By CAITLIN SMITH
Daily Sports Writer
In the top of the tenth inning Sun-
day senior first baseman Mike Dufek
launched his sixth home run of the
season out of Ray Fisher Stadium.
And it couldn't have come at a better
time.

swered runs
for the Wolverines.
The game started off like a breeze
for the Wildcats, as the Wolverines'
pitchers walked in the first four runs
of the game in the top of the second
inning.
Northwestern's third baseman
Chris Lashmet eventually took
advantage of the bases-loaded situ-
ation, knocking a grand slam out of
the park.
The Wolverines were quickly
down by eight runs, and things
looked grim.
Despite cycling through two pitch-
ers by the third inning, Northwest-
ern still managed to extend its lead
to 14 with a six-run rally in the top of
the third inning.
The initial trio of Michigan pitch-
ers - sophomore right-hander
Brandon Sinnery, senior lefty Eric
Katzman and redshirt freshman
lefty Matt Broder - only lasted a
combined four innings and allowed
14 runs on 15 hits.
But the Wolverines clawed back
into the game, scoring often from the
third inning on.
Down 14-12 in the bottom of the
ninth, Michigan was down to its last
out. Junior leftfielder Ryan LaMarre
had just sent a long ball to center
field, falling just short of a home run.
But senior catcher Chris Berset came
up big, keeping the Wolverines alive
by launching a home run over the
centerfield fence and sending the
game to extra innings.
Then came Dufek's game-winner.
"He threw me a changeup first
pitch," Dufek said. "I took a great big

I was thinking he might come back
with it again, so I moved up in the
box so I could get it before it really
broke down.
"He did it again and I guessed
right. I got a pretty good piece of it. I
knew it was gone right after the bat.
It was great."
Going into this weekend's series,
the Wolverines were in a four-way tie
for first in the Big Ten with North-
western, Purdue and Minnesota.
"This is one
you'll never
forget for the
rest of your life."
And at the start of the weekend,
Michigan showed it was worthy of its
lofty spot.
On Friday, LaMarre led the
Wolverines offensively to a 4-3
win with two hits, two runs and
two RBI - one of which brought
in freshman centerfielder Patrick
Biondi in the bottom of the seventh
inning to put Michigan up by the
deciding run.
On Saturday, 10 runs on 18 Wild-
cat hits marred Michigan's 10-8 loss
- and its chance for another huge

comeback win.
Going into the sixth inning, the
Wolverines were down 7-2.
After Toth began the inning by
popping out to first base, LaMarre
launched his fourth home run of the
season.
Berset and sophomore designated
hitter Coley Crank followed suit to
mark the season's first back-to-back-
to-back home runs.
The Wolverines' hot hitting con-
tinued, as seven straight hitters
reached base.
The six-run rally brought Michi-
gan out of the hole and into the
lead.
But the eighth inning proved to be
trouble for the Wolverines. North-
western had a comeback of its own,
scoring three runs on four consecu-
tive hits off junior right-hander Tyler
Burgoon. Michigan had a chance
to answer with the bases loaded for
Crank, but he struck out to end the
threat.
Although the Wolverines were
able to take just one of their two
comeback attempts on the weekend,
they showed they have the necessary
heart to win a conference crown.
"This is one you'll never forget for
the rest of your life," Maloney said.
"Even though it didn't win a cham-
pionship, it's (amazing) just to win a
game when you are down 14 to noth-
ing.
"We will go back to the drawing
board and keep working, but what a
victory it was for today."

Michigan sweeps
Iowa in final series to
clinch third straight
regular season crown
By ALEX HERMANN
Daily Sports Writer
This weekend's series at Iowa
marked several important firsts for
the No. 2 Michigan softball team.
It was the first time in history a

mark in MICHIGAN 6

ent seasons
as well as the first time a Big Ten pro-
gram has won back-to-back-to-back
conference championships as Michi-
gan defeated the Hawkeyes 8-2 on
Friday and 6-0 on Saturday.
The Wolverines' Big Ten title,
secured after their first win on Fri-
day, is the program's 13th, leading all
conference teams.
"Just winning this third one,
especially the third one, because it's
never been done before(has been the
most significant for me)," sophomore
second baseman Amanda Chidester
said.
The second milestone - senior
pitcher Nikki Nemitz's fourth twen-
ty-win season - couldn't have come
at a more opportune time: Saturday
was the lefty's birthday.
"It's a great honor to be able to
leave my mark on such a prestigious
university and be among the greats
that Michigan's had ," Nemitz said.
"To be honest, you can't really do
anything without your team because
I can't score and can't play defense
all by myself."
But just as she has all season,
Nemitz did help her pitching effort
by providing some run support at
the plate. She backed up her one-
hit, complete-game shutout by going
2-for-4 at the plate with two RBI.
The offense also got a boost from
Chidester, with three RBI on the
weekend while extending her hit
streak to seven games after having
mild struggles earlier in the year at
the plate.
"It's coming down to the end of
the season, and I've been working
at it and my team has been support-
ive throughout my whole slump,"
Chidester said. "The coaches and
everyone never gave up on me and it
was just time for me to ... just do it,
I guess.

"And now it's just about having
fun and I'm not stressing anymore
about it."
Friday's game was a little bit of an
oddball for the Wolverines.
Though Michigan only had four
hits on the day, Iowa pitchers gave
Michigan batters 17 free bases on 11
walks and six hit-by-pitches which
the Wolverines capitalized on with
eight runs.
"The key stat in softball on offense
is on-base percentage - you don't
score runs if you're not on base,
you can't, " Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins said. "We found ways to
win. Sometimes we hit home runs,
sometimes we throw perfect games.
In this case we used on-base per-
centage."
But one normality on Saturday
was junior pitcher Jordan Taylor's
performance on the mound against
the Hawkeyes (10-9 Big Ten, 25-23
overall).
Taylor struck out 14 batters in 25
at-bats and gave up just two runs and

stay relentless..
to just attack the
other team."
four hits en route to her 24th victory
of the year. The Valencia, California
native leads the Big Ten with 278
strikeouts on the year, 60 more than
her closest rival.
Now the Wolverines (18-1, 46-6)
will look ahead to obtaining their
ultimate goal, a Women's College
World Series appearance and a
national championship, beginning
with the NCAA regionals next week-
end.
Hutchins said that she wished to
see her team play similar to the Con-
necticut women's basketball team,
which won its second consecutive
national championship this past sea-
son as part of its 78-game winning
streak, an NCAA record.
"You just have to stay relentless,"
Hutchins said. "You have to just
attack the other team. You can't get
on your heels when things don't go
your way. And things have been a
little tougher for us - we've had to
grind out victories as of late.
"And I think that's been good for
us because we have to trust that we
can win even if we're not hitting well
because we pitch well, and if we're
not pitching well we can hit well."
