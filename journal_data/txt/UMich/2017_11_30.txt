A 
new 
nine-story 

development, 
currently 

engaged in the City Council 
approval process, may be built 
on a currently vacant site next 
to the University of Michigan’s 
Medical Campus.

At its Nov. 20 meeting, 

the 
council 
unanimously 

approved the zoning necessary 
for 
the 
development, 
and 

Catherine Ann Development, 
the Bloomfield Hills company 
responsible for the project, will 
bring its designs to the council 
on Dec. 18 for a public hearing 
and final approval.

The development, which is 

estimated to cost $40 million, 
will sit atop a half-acre of land 
that used to be home to a gas 
station and then a laundromat 
before a development project 
was approved in 2005. The 
project 
was 
dropped 
for 

financial reasons, and the site 
has been vacant since then. For 
the past few years, Catherine 
Ann Development has been 
working on a design for the 
space, and it’s now proposed 
a mixed-use building with 
retail and restaurant space. 
However, its focus will be the 
building’s hotel — according to 
Catherine Ann spokesman Tom 
Shields, the company believe 
this development will fill a 
hole in the current Ann Arbor 
infrastructure.

“Ann Arbor is probably one 

of the few major university 
towns that doesn’t really have 
a signature hotel,” Shields said. 
“Even though most people 
in Ann Arbor are developing 
apartments and condos, they 
saw that as a real opportunity. 
… They thought the location 
was perfect, and the timing was 
perfect.”

The site is located at Glen 

Avenue and Ann Street, adjacent 
to the Medical Campus and 

University Hospital. Shields 
said the company hopes to 
service people who are coming 
to town specifically for the 
hospital, but also to the broader 
University and city community.

“(It’s) a combination — for 

those people who are coming 
to Ann Arbor for University 
events or for business looking 
for an upscale, boutique type 
of hotel to stay in, and then 
combined with people who 

are in town to visit patients 
who are at the University 
Hospital, combined with also 
the ability to have conferences 
and a convention space which 
could be used by people who 
are involved in the hospital or 
medical community,” Shields 
said.

As part of the #StopSpencer 

week of action, the Campus 
Antifacist Network hosted a 
teach-in 
Wednesday 
at 
the 

Michigan League. The teach-in 
featured history lecturer Anne 
Berg and LaKisha Simmons, an 
assistant professor of history 
and women’s studies.

Both speakers discussed their 

areas of study in the context 
of the possibility for Richard 
Spencer 
coming 
to 
speak. 

Simmons 
spoke 
about 
how 

certain speech gets censored 
through violence, and Berg 
discussed 
the 
genealogy 
of 

white supremacist thought.

Berg related the issue to Nazi 

Germany and talked about the 
history of national socialism 
and how Nazi racism has a 
longer 
genealogy. 
She 
also 

discussed how violence and 
use of visuals communicates 
on a subconscious level, where 
people learn at an early age to 
read racial messages.

The 
prospect 
of 
white 

nationalist 
Richard 
Spencer 

visiting 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan has raised alarm not 
only on campus, but also among 
city residents and community 
leaders.

Just 
last 
week, 
Mayor 

Christopher Taylor (D) criticized 
Spencer in a Facebook post, 
noting Spencer’s white nationalist 
ideology runs counter to Ann 

Arbor’s commitment to diversity 
and inclusion for people of all 
backgrounds.

“Richard 
Spencer’s 
fearful 

vision of America is an affront 
to Ann Arbor’s values and we 
condemn him. He is not welcome 
here,” Taylor wrote.

Nevertheless, Taylor supported 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel’s decision to consider 
allowing Spencer to speak.

Hundreds walk out of class against 
‘U’ negotiation of Spencer event

free speech, hate

Students gather as part of the #StopSpencer events to protest the University’s consideration to host Richard Spencer on the Diag Wednesday.

Students protest in march around Central Campus as a part of Week of Action
After Taylor support, residents resist

Last 
week, 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
administration 

responded to Richard Spencer’s 
request to speak on campus, and 
moved forward to negotiate the 
event. Today, in protest of the 
administration refusing to deny 
the request, students hundreds 
of walked out of their classes and 
rallied in the Diag, then marched 
into other classrooms on campus.

A few hundred students and 

community members gathered in 
the University of Michigan Diag 
at about noon on Wednesday, and 
after a short rally, marched to 
the Chemistry Building, Mason 
Hall and the Fish Bowl in Angell 
Hall. The rally is part of the 
#StopSpencer week of action, 
which includes teach-ins and 
other forms of protest.

“On 
Wednesday, 
November 

29 2017, Stop Spencer at the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
is 

organizing a student walk out 
at 11:45 AM in response to the 
failure of University of Michigan 

President Mark Schlissel and 
the 
Regents 
to 
deny 
white 

supremacist Richard Spencer’s 
request to speak on campus,” 
the Facebook event reads. “We 
cannot learn in an environment 
that is constantly disrupting our 
learning by threatening our safety 
and dehumanizing us.”

On Nov. 21, the University 

said it was going to proceed with 
Spencer’s request to speak on 
campus, given the administration 
can ensure the safety of students. 
In 
an 
emergency 
meeting 

of the University’s Board of 

Regents, 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel laid out “three 
components” to the decision: the 
safety of students, protecting free 
speech in a democratic society, 
and that denying the request 
would give more attention to 
Spencer and his cause. Schlissel 
repeatedly said safety must be 
guaranteed in order for the event 
to take plcae.

senior 
and 
organizer 

Hoai An Pham said, however,

the Diag the walk out wasn’t just

Reggie the Campus Corgi 

is a beloved sight on campus 
— a beacon of light and hope 
during the dark days of 
incoming winter and finals. 
But he cannot stay the entire 
time, for he must go home and 
rest. But what if Reggie had a 
place on campus to stay, thus 
increasing his time for friendly 
head pats and picturesque 
photoshoots to be posted on 
Facebook?

LSA sophomores Zane 

Harding and Kurt Schwartz 
created an event to build 
a doghouse for Reggie on 
campus. As of Wednesday 
night, 46 are going and nearly 
251 are interested. 

The corgi has seen support 

from the student body 
before — at the beginning 
of this semester, his owner, 
Michael, said Reggie needed 
eye surgery that would cost 
over $1,000. He received 

$810 for the procedure on his 
GoFundMe page.

LSA junior Gaby Fabré 

voiced her support for Reggie 
in a message to The Daily back 
in the summer.

“I just wanna see Reggie 

walking around campus again, 
the little fluff is a free spirit 
and makes my day a little 
brighter seeing him bounce 
around the diag from student 
to student,” she wrote.

Reggie’s presence on social 

media started earlier this year; 
he currently has 4,274 friends 
on Facebook.

“(R)eggie is a good boy and 

deserves a good place to stay 
on campus,” the new event 
page reads. “he is a dog who 
runs his own social media 
account. he cannot make his 
own house because he does 
not have thumbs.”

ON THE DAILY: REGGIE THE CAMPUS 
CORGI GETS A NEW HOME

CHUN SO/Daily

Presenters and participants of the Michigan Forward Symposium exchange 
ideas about their research and diversity at Weiser Hall Wednesday.

MICHIGAN FORWARD

in protest to the University’s 
response last week.

“This week is not just about 

protesting 
Spencer 
coming 

here, 
it’s 
about 
protesting 

white supremacy and it’s about 
protesting the administration’s 
lackluster response, inactive, 
bystander response to a literal 
white supremacist coming on 
this campus,” Pham said. “The 
thing is here too, on this campus 
every single day, on a regular 
basis we have hate crimes that 
are coming.”

Spencer’s 
representative 

first requested he speak on the 
University’s campus at the end 
of October. This request came 
after Spencer had requested 
to 
speak 
at 
several 
other 

universities, including Michigan 
State University and University 
of Florida. The University of 
Florida initially denied a request 
from Spencer, but after being 
threatened 
with 
a 
lawsuit, 

relented and allowed Spencer to 
speak in October.

On Aug. 17, a statement 

released from the Office of the 
President at Michigan State 
University 
declared 
MSU 

would deny the National Policy 
Institute’s 
request 
to 
rent 

space on campus. The NPI is 
a conservative think tank led 
by Spencer. MSU now faces a 
lawsuit for not allowing Spencer 
to speak.

The 
lawyer 
representing 

Spencer threatened to sue the 
University earlier in November 
if it did not accommodate 
Spencer’s request, giving the 
administration a week deadline 
to make a decision. This deadline 
has since been extended until 
Dec. 8.

Previously, University Regent 

Ron Weiser (R) said in an email 
Spencer was “a dangerous and 
disgusting man.”

University 
Regent 
Denise 

Illitch (D), however, was the only 
regent opposing the decision last 
week, stating while free speech 
is a concern of hers, the violence 
that accompanies Spencer must 

be considered.

“Unfortunately, 
I 
do 
not 

agree with the University of 
Michigan 
administration,” 

she 
said. 
“While 
I 
am 
a 

staunch proponent of the First 
Amendment, and stand firmly 
in support of our constitution, 
I remain very concerned that it 
is unsafe to allow him to speak 
at the University of Michigan. 
Violence follows him wherever 
he goes.”

LSA senior Kim Truong, 

free speech should not justify 
the administration potentially 
allowing space on campus for 
Spencer to speak.

“So a lot of people cling on to 

the idea that we need to have 
people speak because we should 
welcome all ideas, but sometimes 
their ideas have proven to be 
really harmful over and over 
again,” Truong said. “Why do we 
need to keep listening to Nazis? 
If we give them a space, it’s 
saying that those ideas are valid 
and should be listened to.”

For LSA freshman Payton 

White, not walking out of class 
would be remaining complicit in 

Spencer coming to campus.

“I 
feel 
like 
if 
you’re 

not against someone like 
him, then you’re basically 
advocating for him so I 
couldn’t just sit in class,” 
White said. “Personally, if 
he comes to campus, my life 
isn’t going to change because 
if I give him attention that 
he wants and that’s exactly 
what he wants and this is 
exactly why he did all of this 
but I feel like if we as a group 
ignore him and don’t give 
him any attention, it would be 
more effective than actually 
coming and being violent 
or being negative about the 
whole situation.”

During 
the 
protest, 
a 

situation occurred in the 
Fishbowl where LSA junior 
Princess 
Felix 
challenged 

protesters, arguing it would 
not be fair to bar Spencer from 
speaking. If students didn’t 
like what he was saying, Felix 
said, they shouldn’t listen.

“I

njustice 
anywhere 

is a threat to justice 
everywhere.” 

These 
words 
by 
Martin 

Luther King Jr. have resonated 
deeply with me since reading 
them last semester. The problem 
now is that, coming from 
someone not firmly on either 
side of the political spectrum, I 
see injustice everywhere.

When I went to hear Charles 

Murray speak, I wanted to be 
a fly on the wall during the 
protest, but I was moved to 
speak when the protesters shut 
down his speech. Murray wrote 
a best-selling book, predicted 
in 
2012 
a 
candidate 
like 

Donald Trump would win the 

2016 election and was invited 
to speak at the school by a 
student organization. As the 
protesters left, they screamed, 
“No fascist USA!” I yelled back 
at them, “This protest is the 
most fascist thing I have seen 
at this school!”

I read the op-ed titled “The 

only fascist, sexist bigot in the 
classroom” and the op-ed titled 
“To the fascist, sexist bigot in 
the classroom” and felt torn 
because they were both right 
and both wrong at the same 
time. I’ve been studying the 
rise of original fascists in my 
fascist cinema class, and it’s 
hard not to see the parallels to 
Germany in the ’20s. But the 

constant polarization in our 
country only contributes more 
to that. By calling everyone who 
voted for Trump a fascist, you 
alienate them from your ideas, 
driving them to someone even 
worse like Richard Spencer. 
This kind of infighting that I 
have seen in our community is 
so dangerous because it makes 
us more vulnerable to true 
evils and true fascists. That is 
why when people say that you 
must pick a side, I respond that 
I am very happy to be in the 
middle, trying to bridge the gap 
between the right and the left.

Including the ME/NA identity 

category on University documents 
would be a very easy, yet important, 
way for the University to show that 
it is truly committed to inclusivity 
of all ethnicities on all three of 
its campuses. According to the 
Student Campus Climate Survey 
on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, 
ME/NA students currently make 
up about 2 percent of the student 
body at University of Michigan’s 
Ann Arbor campus, while email 
correspondence with Sally Howell, 
director of the Center for Arab 
American Studies at U-M Dearborn, 
revealed these students make up 
a significantly greater proportion 
at 
the 
University’s 
Dearborn 

campus. Michigan also has the 
second highest Arab-American 
population in the country. Central 
Student Government and LSA 
Student Government unanimously 
passed resolutions in support of 
this addition. Moreover, the U.S. 
Census Bureau is proposing the 
ME/NA category be added for 
the 2020 census. The University 
administration should therefore 
mirror 
student 
and 
national 

commitment to inclusivity and 
follow suit.

Collecting this data will also 

allow students who identify as 
ME/NA to be better represented on 
campus. Currently, the students 
who would identify as part of the 
ME/NA category have to grapple 
with being lumped into a “white” 
or 
“other” 
box, 
effectively 

skewing 
the 
demographic 

statistics of the University. A more 
accurate depiction of the number of 
ME/NA students at the University 
could bring more lobbying power 
for ME/NA student organizations.

We 
understand 
there 
are 

concerns 
among 
some 
that 

adding 
the 
ME/NA 
category 

could increase targeting from 
the government, especially given 
the nation’s current climate of 
increasing Islamophobia. However, 
targeting could potentially occur 
for a number of ethnicity or racial 
groups. Moreover, checking a 
particular box is a reflection of 
an individual’s self-identification 
as a member of a particular 
ethnic group, so if someone is not 
comfortable identifying as part 
of the ME/NA group, they do not 
have to report this information.

These concerns also should 

not pose an issue to students’ 

safety on campus. Historically, 
the 
University 
has 
vowed 

to 
protect 
the 
personal 

information of its students that 
could potentially harm them. 
After the Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals repeal, for 
example, University President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
was 
quick 

to state that the University 
would not release information 
pertaining 
to 
student’s 

citizenship status. Finally, and 
arguably most importantly, we 
must consider that those who 
are calling for the addition 
of this category are those on 
our campus who would be 
most affected by this change. 
Therefore, we should listen to 
the will of this community.

When 
this 
campaign 
is 

presented 
at 
the 
Board 
of 

Regents meeting on Dec. 7, we 
urge the regents to vote in favor 
of adding the ME/NA category 
to 
University 
documents. 
If 

the University is serious about 
increasing diversity, equity and 
inclusion, and it is truly willing 
to listen to the community, the 
University must add the ME/NA 
identity to its documents.

Nazi 

sympathizer ran a car 
over protester Heather 

Heyer in Charlottesville, Va., 
crushing 
her 
to 

death. 
She 
died 

amid a melee during 
the Unite the Right 
rally, a collection of 
white 
supremacists, 

Klansmen and neo-
Nazis led in part by 
Richard 
Spencer. 

Spencer called the 
rally a “huge moral 
victory” and vowed 
he and his white 
nationalist friends would soon 
return to Charlottesville. 

Now, Richard Spencer has 

vowed to spew his brand of 
violent white supremacist hatred 
on our campus. University of 
Michigan administrators stated 
they will allow Spencer to 
speak, given they can “assure a 
reasonably safe setting.” Given 
Spencer’s obvious desire for 
conflict 
and 
connections 
to 

hyper-violent white extremists, 
the University cannot assure any 
sort of reasonably safe setting for 
this event. For the safety of this 
campus’s students and faculty, as 
well as city residents, I implore 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel and the University to 
deny Spencer’s request.

Spencer’s entire raison d’être 

is to disguise the violent, bloody 
Nazism of the American white 
nationalist movement under a 
cloak of clean-cut charm and 
academic acceptability. He has 
founded an academic policy 
institute 
devoted 
to 
racial 

supremacy and claims he wishes 
to engage in academic debate on 
campus. He denies promoting 
violence and calls for a “peaceful” 
ethnic cleansing. Yet, anything 
more than a cursory glance at his 
past reveals Spencer is anything 
but peaceful.

First, Spencer has consistently 

demonstrated 
a 
pervasive 

connection 
to 
violent 
white 

extremists. Alongside neo-Nazis 
and the Ku Klux Klan, Spencer 
was instrumental in planning 
the Unite the Right rally near 
the 
University 
of 
Virginia’s 

campus, 
which 
resulted 
in 

three deaths and 34 injuries. 
Outside of Spencer’s speech in 
October at the University of 
Florida, police arrested three 
of Spencer’s supporters who 
threatened to kill and fired a gun 
at campus protesters. At Auburn 
University, police arrested a 
Spencer supporter for beating up 
an antifa protester.

For every Spencer supporter 

that commits acts of violence, 
many more threaten to. For 
example, 
commenters 
on 

a video he posted after the 
Charlottesville rally advocated to 
“gas the Jews,” start a “racial holy 
war,” “physically attack liberals” 
and start “killing n------ left and 
right.” Wherever Spencer goes, 
violent white nationalists follow.

A police presence cannot 

guarantee safety from committed 
racial extremists. A heavy police 
presence at Charlottesville did 
not stop deaths or severe injury. 
In fact, two Virginia State Police 
troopers lost their lives in a 
helicopter crash while patrolling 
the chaos in Charlottesville. 
This policing is also expensive: 

The University of Florida spent 
$500,000 on security when 
Spencer spoke on its campus. 

Far from condemning his 

violent 
followers, 

Spencer consistently 
shows them support. 
He 
called 
the 

man 
who 
killed 

Heather 
Heyers 
a 

“scapegoat” in a “very 
ambiguous situation.” 
Additionally, Spencer 
has 
joked 
about 

the “alt-right” troll 
who 
purposefully 

elicited 
epileptic 

seizures in Jewish journalist 
Kurt Eichenwald, an “alt-right” 
critic. He has endorsed a legal 
defense fund for the person 
who triggered the seizures and 
retweeted 
anti-Semitic 
slurs 

targeting Eichenwald. Spencer 
obviously has little problem with 
violence that contributes to the 
white nationalist cause.

Furthermore, 
Ann 
Arbor 

has the distinct displeasure of 
being less than an hour-long car 
ride away from at least 11 racial 
hate groups, according to the 
Southern Poverty Law Center. 
One of these groups, the National 
Socialist Movement, is one of the 
largest neo-Nazi organizations 
in the country. It has a history 
of political violence, including 
soliciting the murder of a federal 
judge 
and 
harassing 
Latino 

immigrants. The Ku Klux Klan, 
anti-Muslim groups and more 
neo-Nazis round out the other 
hate groups.

Spencer’s visit to campus 

presents 
these 
violent 

organizations with the perfect 
opportunity to unite in a display 
of racism. Their proximity to 
campus significantly endangers 
marginalized 
students 
and 

faculty. If the Charlottesville 
rally taught us one thing, it’s that 
large groups of white nationalists 
engender violence.

Moreover, 
Spencer 
fully 

understands the controversy his 
views breed and no doubt intends 
to stoke conflict by appearing 
on campus. He views college 
campuses as centers of “cultural 
Marxism” — which he describes 
in coded anti-Semitism as blindly 
promoting 
diversity 
for 
the 

sake of multicultural globalism. 
Spencer also maintains close ties 
to Identity Evropa, the group 
responsible 
for 
distributing 

racist flyers at Eastern Michigan 
University this year and that 
exists to stoke racial tensions on 
college campuses.

Organizers 
for 
Spencer’s 

college campus tour described 
the events as explicitly “anti-
liberal,” and Spencer consistently 
mentions his anticipation of 
violence between antifa and 
his supporters at his speeches. 
Additionally, 
Spencer 
doesn’t 

care about free speech — he 
has repeatedly demonstrated 
disdain 
for 
government-

protected freedoms and the 
principles 
of 
the 
founding 

fathers in his writings. Rather 
than 
sparking 
meaningful 

debate, his appearances aim for 
the national media attention a 
violent clash between students 
and 
his 
supporters 
would 

bring. No fewer than five other 
prominent public universities 
understood this when denying 
him from their campuses.

The 
University 

administration 
understands 

Spencer’s quest for attention, 
yet wrongly concluded that 
“denying the request would 
provide even more attention 
to the speaker and his cause.” 
The “alt-right” already views 
college campuses as intolerant 
suppressors of free speech. 
Allowing Spencer on campus 
will neither enlighten his neo-
Nazi followers to the liberalism 
of higher education just as 
denying 
his 
request 
would 

not convince more reasonable 
Americans to join his cause.

Furthermore, 
the 
media 

firestorm 
over 
potential 

violence 
dramatically 

outweighs 
any 
attention 

denying 
his 
request 
would 

bring. Take the case of the riots 
that erupted at University of 
California at Berkeley earlier 
this year in response to the 
campus hosting controversial 
speaker 
Milo 
Yiannopoulos. 

A group of extreme antifa 
protesters 
threw 
Molotov 

cocktails and even beat far-
right 
supporters, 
despite 
a 

heavy police presence. The 
violence has served as endless 
ammunition for conservative 
critics 
building 
a 
view 
of 

colleges as enemies of free 
speech. And given Spencer’s 
connections 
to 
violent 

extremists and inflammatory 
style, 
the 
University 
can’t 

reasonably guarantee violence 
won’t 
occur. 
An 
analogous 

violent outburst at our similarly 
liberal campus would likely 
do irreparable harm to the 
reputation 
of 
the 
United 

States’s public universities. 

I respect the legal bind 

the University finds itself in 
and realize the courts have 
compelled universities to host 
Richard Spencer before. I 
also revere universities’ role 
in 
protecting 
controversial 

speech and promoting heated 
yet productive dialogue. 

However, Richard Spencer 

speaking on campus presents a 
threat of violence far too high 
for the University to ignore. 
Schools 
such 
as 
Michigan 

State University, Penn State 
University and Louisiana State 
University have all denied 
Spencer out of concern for 
campus safety. I implore the 
administration 
to 
similarly 

throw all its legal weight 
behind 
barring 
Spencer’s 

presence 
on 
campus. 
You 

might not win the court battle, 
but the marginalized members 
of this campus community at 
least deserve a try.

F

or a substantial portion of the student body, approaching 
the race and ethnicity section on University of Michigan 
documents poses an issue: Their ethnic identity isn’t there. 

Such is the reality of many students who identify as Middle 
Eastern or North African. The #WeExist campaign, launched this 
past week, calls for the creation of a Middle Eastern/North African 
category on University documents to give more representation for 
people who identify with those ethnic categories. The petition, 
penned by organizers of the campaign, has 704 signatures 
and counting. With overwhelming support from student 
organizations and all three University campuses, The Michigan 
Daily’s Editorial Board calls on the University’s Board of Regents 
to include a ME/NA category on University documents. 

Fixing Black Friday

A

h, 
Black 
Friday. 
It’s 

difficult to understate the 
intensity and pure insanity 

of the day after Thanksgiving, 
when millions of turkey-stuffed 
Americans rush out of their homes 
in the early morning to stand in line 
at local retailers, awaiting all the 
season’s finest accessories.

Except this description isn’t 

quite right. Many of these eager 
consumers actually leave their 
homes before the turkey comes out 
of the oven. Now, many stores open 
their doors on Thanksgiving Day 
to increase revenue. This comes at 
the expense of tired workers who 
are forced to spend more time away 
from their families on a day that is 
meant for gratitude. This doesn’t 
seem right.

Another problem with Black 

Friday? People die — they get 
trampled like Mufasa in “The Lion 
King.” Fights break out. Is this 
really what the holidays are all 
about? Does Black Friday have to 
be so dark?

No — it’s time we make some 

changes. With a few adjustments 
by the government and retail 
stores, we can fix all of these issues.

Reform #1: Force stores to 

close on Thanksgiving

First, 
federal 
law 
should 

require that stores close on 
Thanksgiving to allow workers 
to spend time with family and 
friends. While some may make 
the argument that many workers 
need the extra pay that comes 
from working on Thanksgiving, 
I 
think 
the 
majority 
of 

employees would prefer to have 

Thanksgiving off — and they 
would benefit from time with 
loved ones as well.

Of course, this is a debate 

that 
revolves 
around 
money. 

Earlier this month, USA Today 
published an article arguing for 
the economic benefits of staying 
open on Thanksgiving. As one 
would expect, there are many 
pluses, including increased foot 
traffic and (obviously) higher sales. 
The primary reason that a store 
should stay open on Thanksgiving, 
however, is the steep opportunity 
cost of closing; the company would 
miss out on tons of revenue, which 
would go directly to its competitors.

But what if we eliminated at 

least part of this cost by passing 
laws that require stores to 
remain closed on Thanksgiving? 
This might seem far-fetched, 
but a few states (Massachusetts, 
Rhode Island and Maine, for 
example) already have these 
laws. 
Federal 
legislation 

requiring that retailers give 
workers Thanksgiving off would 
allow employees a chance to be 
with their families, and it would 
lessen the economic impact 
on companies because every 
business would be held to the 
same standard.

Reform 
#2: 
Make 
Black 

Friday safe again

It is time we make companies 

liable for injuries or deaths as a 
result of the Black Friday store-
opening frenzies. This is simple: 
No one should have to die over 
a $59 Xbox or a half-price flat-
screen TV.

Overaggressive 
shopping 

behavior has produced many 
click-bait news stories that 
are as incredible as they are 
horrifying. 
In 
2008, 
200 

people stormed into a Long 
Island 
Walmart, 
trampling 

and killing an employee. Three 
years later in a Target in West 
Virginia, 
a 
man 
collapsed 

while 
crowds 
rushed 
into 

the store. No one helped him 
— some stepped over him in 
search of bargains. The man 
died later at the hospital. As 
if these tragic tales weren’t 
enough, here’s a sign that 
we’ve gone too far with Black 
Friday: There is a website, 
blackfridaydeathcount.com, 
solely dedicated to keeping 
track of Black Friday deaths 
and injuries.

Of course, one solution is 

for shoppers to step up and be 
civil. But influencing behavior 
among a massive population of 
eager — sometimes desperate — 
customers is difficult; the more 
likely solution is for stores to 
be more vigilant in preventing 
Black 
Friday 
violence. 

Companies have myriad options: 
hire 
more 
security 
guards, 

install more cameras, work with 
local police so officers will be 
on-hand or only allow a small 
number of shoppers in when the 
store opens.

‘Cuba’ is a stark look at 
life under a dictatorship

Cuba has historically been 

a 
site 
of 
popular 
glamour 

and mystery to Americans, 
but most have never had the 
opportunity to see the country 
for 
themselves. 

Aside 
from 

their cigars, the 
nation’s 
cultural 

allure has been 
inaccessible 
to 

foreign travelers 
due to a complicated political 
history brought about by Fidel 
Castro’s 
socialist 
revolution. 

Thanks 
to 
Jon 
Alpert 

(“Redemption”), Cuba’s obscure 
charm is exposed in the form of 
raw footage in his new Netflix 
documentary, “Cuba and the 
Cameraman.”

The documentary features 

footage than spans over 45 
years and Alpert, who began 
his roots in New York City 
activism, borrows from the 
French, cinéma verité style 
of filmmaking that is highly 
direct in its formal approach 
and that it aims to reveal a 
truth about a harsh reality: in 
the case of this film, the toll 

of socialism in a struggling 
nation. What becomes clear in 
Alpert’s work is that over the 
45 years he returned to Cuba, a 
lot changed — his subjects aged, 
the consequences of socialism 
in food and medicine scarcity 
began to truly sink in — but a 
lot of the country’s progress 
became static. The toughest 

moments 
to 

watch 
on-screen 

are 
those 
that 

grimly 
reveal 

that 
the 
nation 

and 
its 
people 

have 
remained 

stagnant, stuck in a place 
beyond political repair, a place 
with barren streets and roofs 
caved in. A place without water 
to drink.

Alpert 
follows 
the 
lives 

of three different groups of 
people, and as the years pass, 
there is an amount of audience 
investment and empathy that 
naturally comes along with 
seeing these repeated subjects 
on screen. They color the piece 
with humanity. He tracks a 
man named Luis as he goes 
in and out of jail, a woman 
named Caridad who begins as 
a bright schoolgirl who dreamt 
of being a nurse but instead 
wed at the age of 14. And then 

there’s Gregorio, Cristobal and 
Angel, three campesinos (farm 
workers) who are reminiscent 
of the playful fraternal bond 
of Super Mario Brothers. They 
eventually have their livestock 
stolen and lose their means to 
work, but somehow they sustain 
happiness and remind us that 
you don’t need teeth to have a 
beaming smile and that rum 
should be carried on a person at 
all times.

It is never explained how 

Alpert and his crew were able 
to travel in and out of Cuba so 
freely, especially during a period 
of heightened political tensions, 
nor is it explained why Alpert 
was allowed in such intimate 
settings with Castro, like his 
private plane. Alpert’s American 
speech subconsciously seems to 
distract and detract from the 
authenticity of these ordinary 
Spanish speakers that cannot 
speak English, so using only 
subtitles may have created more 
of a narrative flow.

Though what really dazzles 

most about the piece is not 
Alpert’s 
impressive 
45-year 

commitment, but rather the 
simple lives and stories of 
Cubans who find joy in the 
smallest things. We could all 
learn a lot from them.

‘The Star’ wildly fails to 
bring the Nativity to life

It borders on trite to say that a 

great animated film can speak to 
anyone, but that’s the nature of 
the medium. It begs to explore its 
topic in new and interesting ways, 
so the idea of using 
it to retell the story 
of the Nativity told 
from the point of 
view of the donkey 
that carried Mary 
to Bethlehem isn’t 
that far off base. In 
the hands of a team 
more well-versed in animation’s 
unique 
storytelling 
capabilities 

– Disney, Laika, WAG or even 
Dreamworks or Illumination – 
there’s a potentially memorable 
film in the works. Unfortunately, 
in the hands of Sony Pictures 
Animation, 
the 
group 
which 

birthed this year’s brain-numbing 
anti-comedy “The Emoji Movie,” 
“The Star” becomes the latest in 
a long line of poorly animated, 
sloppily written cash grabs whose 
only purpose is to take advantage 
of families looking for an accessible 
Christmas movie.

The 
problems 
with 
the 

animation rear their ugly heads 
early on; this quality would be 
standard and unremarkable if 
this were the mid-2000s. The fact 
of the matter is that the art form 
has progressed remarkably in the 
years since, allowing for films 
like “Coco” which would have 
been impossible even a few short 
years ago. But where Pixar’s latest 

delivered painstakingly rendered 
frames with millions of details, 
“The Star” features multiple scenes 
of characters looking at each other 
but seemingly not seeing each 
other. The expressivity allowed by 
animation is negated by the lifeless 
masks which comprise most of the 
characters.

The writing does the characters 

no favors, either, 
making the leads 
easily 
identifiable 

only by the tropes 
they 
fall 
into. 

Bo 
the 
Donkey 

(Steven Yeun, “The 
Walking Dead”) is 
the dreamer who 

wants something more than his 
simple life. Dave the Dove (Keegan-
Michael Key, “Keanu”) is the wacky 
sidekick. He shakes his butt in one 
scene and it’s called back to so often 
that it was apparently the scene 
that was supposed to clinch the 
film its Oscar. Ruth the Sheep (Aidy 
Bryant, “The Big Sick”) talks about 
being a “flock” a lot and would have 
been the emotional heart of the 
film had she not been written with 
a crippling lack of personality.

But the weak links in a cast 

made up of weak links are the three 
camels carrying the wise men of 
“We Three Kings” fame. These 
are apparently meant to be comic 
relief, but somewhere along the 
line, someone forgot to write any 
actual jokes. At one point, one of 
these camels (Oprah Winfrey, “The 
Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks”) 
gets the absolutely incredible 
line, “That King Herod is up to 
something,” which is perhaps 
the most casual way the topic of 

infanticide has been broached in 
film history.

For the most part, the vocal 

performances are serviceable, and 
given the quality of the writing, 
it’s understandable that no one in 
the surprisingly packed cast brings 
their A-game. Gina Rodriguez 
(“Jane the Virgin”) and Zachary 
Levi (“Alias Grace”) are the stand-
outs here as Mary and Joseph, if 
only because their characters are 
the only ones who can pass for 
interesting and the actors therefore 
have something to work with.

Once more, the camels represent 

the worst “The Star” has to offer in 
this area. In addition to Winfrey, 
Tracy Morgan (“Fist Fight”) and 
Tyler Perry (“Boo 2! A Madea 
Halloween”) 
lend 
their 
vocal 

talents to the film, and they bring 
with them their respective shticks. 
Morgan shouts nearly every single 
line. On the other end of the 
spectrum is Perry, who reads every 
line without a hint of inflection. 
Winfrey, the most talented of the 
trio, hardly bears mentioning, as 
she never gets an opportunity to 
ingratiate herself to the audience 
beyond 
the 
aforementioned 

genocide line.

The only memorable thing about 

“The Star” is when the Baby Jesus 
finally makes an appearance, he 
bears an uncanny resemblance to 
the Boss Baby, which is either an 
unfortunate mistake or the most 
brilliant, underplayed joke of the 
year. And when the best part of an 
animated movie very likely comes 
down to animator ignorance, it’s 
probably better to see what new 
brilliance the grown-ups — Pixar 
perhaps — are up to.

TV REVIEW
‘Runaways’ is lackluster

Parents are supposed to be the 

good guys, right? Well, that’s not 
the case in Marvel’s “Runaways.” 
Last week marked the series 
premiere of Hulu’s original show. 
Six teenagers, all 
vastly 
different 

with a past, messy 
friendship reunite 
just in time to 
discover 
their 

parents’ secret.

“Runaways” 

is based on the superhero comic 
book series written by Brian K. 
Vaughan and Adrian Alphona, 
first published by Marvel Comics 
in 2003. Originally, the comic 
book series cast the parents as 
robbers and mad scientists, but 
Hulu creators Josh Schwartz 
(“The O.C.”) and Stephanie Savage 
(“Gossip Girl”) opted for full on 
super villains. ’Cause let’s be 
honest, parents being villains isn’t 
the farthest cinematic stretch.

Marvel has always been a 

favorite of mine. Superheros? 
Love ’em. Action? Count me in. 
However, the pace of “Runaways” 
is too jumbled compared to 
past Marvel products. It hops 
around from scene to scene in a 
mismanaged function, ruining 
the flow. There are a lot of 
unanswered 
questions 
while 

watching: What happened to 

the right eyebrow star tattooed 
girl in the very beginning? What 
happened to Nico’s (Lyrica Okano, 
“Pimp”) sister, Amy? What is the 
weird human-like creature in 
Mrs. Dean’s (Annie Wersching, 
“Bosch”) office? Why do the 
Yorks have a dinosaur in their 
basement? Cliffhangers are an 
effective way to keep an audience 

engaged, but too 
many just frustrate 
and confuse. 

The 
symmetry 

among 
the 

six 
teenagers 

appeared to have 
been broken a long 

time ago. As the plotline reveals, 
these six used to be best friends, 
but high school and some tragic 
enigma (I think it had to do 
with Amy) happened that split 
these friends, but apparently 
not for good. All of the friends 
have morphed into different 
stereotypes in high school. Never 
seen that before. We have the 
goth chick, the dumb jock, the 
pretentious pretty girl, the nerdy 
and self righteous feminist, the 
quiet misfit and lastly, the socially 
excommunicated, 
emotionally 

broken kid that just wants his 
friends back. He attempts to 
reunite this old gang — which 
leads to their discovery of their 
parents in red robes performing 
some cult sacrifice. Creepy. 

I’m hoping this plotline is just 

the catalyst to jumpstart a more 
original series. The first episode 

attemps to get the ball rolling. 
Although the premiere itself was 
nothing to rave about, I have a 
feeling the show will morph into a 
story with heart, action and some 
ass-kicking.

There doesn’t seem to be 

enough variability between the 
characters. Each is filled with 
teenage angst that gets tiresome 
after watching it take shape in 
a few different shells. All of the 
actors have the same babyface 
pout, none bringing anything 
valuable to the table. The casting 
is subpar, neither brilliant nor 
terrible. Both the actors cast as 
parents and teenagers walk the 
line of average, none of them 
striking enough to report on.

The special effects appear to be 

limited thus far, but there are hints 
that they will be more plentiful 
and complex in the future. Besides 
the one scene when Karolina’s 
(Virginia Gardner, “Zoo”) arms 
turn 
transparent 
with 
lights 

shooting out of them, there should 
be more to come. Marvel is known 
for 
their 
topnotch 
cinematic 

illusions, which I expect when I 
watch one of their products.

The premise of “Runaways” 

has potential, but the series 
premiere was essentially a dud. 
The 
messy 
shooting, 
boring 

actors and mundane feel of the 
show in general take away from 
a seemingly great storyline. With 
time, the plot with hopefully 
develop to be stronger, better and 
more entertaining.

Call to Action 4 Instructors 
to say ‘no’ to Spencer’s visit

Marginalized identity in 
‘The Shape of Water’

A home away from home

University 
of 
Michigan 

faculty, 
graduate 
student 

instructors, 
research 

assistants and staff:

We are writing this to 

request that you to cancel 
classes Nov. 30 to pressure 
the administration to refuse 
to allow Richard Spencer to 
speak on campus, as well as 
show leniency to marginalized 
students 
who 
have 
been 

affected by our oppressive 
campus 
environment 

throughout the rest of the 
semester.

The recent decision to “begin 

discussions 
with 
Richard 

Spencer’s group to determine 
whether he will be allowed to 
rent space” on the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
campus 

demonstrates, 
as 
we 
have 

learned time and time again, 
the administration’s refusal to 
truly prioritize the needs and 
safety of its students. Though 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

stated “if we cannot assure a 
reasonably safe setting for the 
event, we will not allow it to 
go forward,” Spencer’s history 
shows us there is no “safe” 
setting possible when white 
supremacists and neo-Nazis 
are given permission to come 
to college campuses.

On 
this 
campus 
alone, 

marginalized students are in 
danger of hate crimes every 
day, from white supremacist 
flyers, 
spray 
paint 
asking 

to “Free Dylann Roof” and 
the n-word written on door 
signs. 
The 
University 
has 

not been able to catch any 
of these perpetrators, nor to 
prevent 
such 
attacks 
from 

happening. There is no history 
or precedent of Schlissel being 
able to “assure a reasonable 
safe setting” within his own 
campus, let alone if Spencer 
chooses to come here. Howell, 
only 
33 
minutes 
away, 
is 

known as a base of the Ku 

Klux Klan. Michigan has one 
of the largest armed civilian 
militias in the country, whose 
members engage in violent 
white 
supremacist 
rhetoric. 

These groups, and numerous 
others, will show up and harm 
marginalized 
students 
on 

campus. They have not failed 
to do so in the past.

Students 
come 
to 
the 

University to attend classes 
and learn. When individuals 
like 
Richard 
Spencer 
and 

his followers are allowed to 
convene on campus, there is 
inherently a barrier created 
for marginalized students just 
trying to exist and receive 
an education. The academic 
integrity of this institution 
will always be in question 
when portions of students are 
denied the right to safety on 
campus –– this denial only 
exacerbates the inequities that 
already exist at the University 
of Michigan.

At 
the 
very 
root, 
this 

university should exist to serve 
every one of its students, and 
it is not doing so if students 
are forced to skip class and 
schoolwork in order to advocate 
for their fundamental human 
rights. In allowing Spencer to 
come, students are forced to do 
work (for free) that Schlissel 
and administrators are paid to 
do and continually fail to do. 
This is not even including the 
mental and physical toll that it 
takes to have to face oppression 
here every day. 

These 
are 
simple 

requests. We ask that you 
stand in solidarity with us, 
marginalized 
folx 
across 

campus 
and 
the 
broader 

community, 
by 
canceling 

class, discussions, labs and 
any other academic obligations 
on Thursday, Nov. 30, 2017. 
Alongside this we ask that 
students 
get 
the 
leniency 

needed to successfully finish 
the term, given the reality that 
our campus, classes, homes, 
residence halls and community 
have 
continually 
remained 

unsafe. Students are unable 

to academically succeed when 
they are forced to fight to exist 
on this campus.

Students4Justice and other 

organizers

We 
understand 
that 

leniency 
for 
marginalized 

students can be interpreted 
in many different ways. Our 
overall goal in this ask is for 
these students to be given a 
fair chance to succeed in their 
classes, because the current 
campus climate places them 
at a disadvantage. Below are 
some potential ideas that we 
have used our labor and time 
to come up with: 

• Waived class attendance 

requirements or more 
excused absences

• Extensions on assignments

• Create spaces in classes to 

talk about events

• Make assignments more 

relevant to campus/world 
climate

• Provide alternate 

assignments and 
opportunities for students 
to receive credit

• Ask students what they 

need to be successful in the 
course given everything 
that has happened (do not 
target students who you 
feel like are “more” likely 
to be affected. E.g., Black 
students, brown students, 
etc. Those assumptions 
can cause more harm than 
good)

• Make yourself available 

and approachable for 
students to ask for 
assistance

• Read the news in order to 

keep yourself updated, so 
you can come into class 
with prior knowledge 
and not force students to 
explain everything

When most people think 

of home, they often think of 
a warm and cozy place filled 
with loved ones, light and 
home cooked meals.

But 
what 
always 
comes 

to my mind are small rocks 
and slabs of concrete painted 
bright green and a dark, rusty 
red. This is all that remains of 
my father’s house in Jaffna, 
Sri Lanka — the house that I 
would have grown up in and 
the house that I would have 
called mine. What is left of 
my father’s house has melded 

with the soil, indistinguishable 
from the earth it once stood 
upon, as if it never existed in 
the first place.

Most people would not find 

solace in a pile of ruins. But I 
did. And I still do.

A seemingly trivial mass 

of rocks, rubble and concrete 
grounds me, reminding me 
of my heritage. Each shard 
represents my roots, my family, 
my identity, my ethnicity. And 
so, I refuse to look at them as 
broken and meaningless.

Tupac once wrote about a 

“rose that grew from a crack 
in the concrete.” While I’m not 

sure that I can ever be that rose, 
I hope to be the roots growing 
underneath the concrete that 
supports 
my 
family 
while 

bringing awareness to some 
of the experiences within the 
Tamil diaspora.

I won’t ever know what it 

would have been like to grow 
up in Northern Sri Lanka and 
I recognize that I have had the 
immense privilege of not being 
raised in a war-torn country. 
But at the end of the day, a 
mound of rocks and concrete 
will always be my home away 
from home.

Guillermo 
del 
Toro, 
a 

Mexican-American 
film 

director 
and 
writer, 
is 

renowned 
for 
his 
hybrid 

genres, weaving fairy tales 
with dark, haunting imagery 
of the sexual, religious and 
taboo. 
From 
his 
award-

winning Spanish gothic films 
like “Pan’s Labyrinth” to his 
supernatural-robot-monster 
stories like “Pacific Rim” and 
“Hellboy,” del Toro has made 
himself a household name 
in an industry traditionally 
dominated by The Whites. His 
upcoming film, “The Shape of 
Water,” is set to be released in 
December. But unlike most of 
his past works, he has made its 
underlying messages clear. In 
a Q&A session with Michigan 
in Color, del Toro explained 
his messages and intentions to 
promote the upcoming film.

 “The Shape of Water” 

is set in the Cold War era 
and 
follows 
government 

laboratory cleaner Elisa (Sally 
Hawkins, 
“Paddington 
2”) 

as she encounters a captured 
Amazonian, 
an 
amphibious 

creature called “the Asset.” The 
story details the two falling in 
love. Her attempt to break the 
Asset out of its imprisonment, 
with co-worker Zelda (Octavia 
Spencer, 
“The 
Help”) 
and 

next-door 
neighbor 
Giles 

(Richard Jenkins, “Comrade 
Detective”), 
is 
obstructed 

by 
the 
violence 
of 
secret 

Soviet spy Robert Hoffstetler 
(Michael 
Stuhlbarg, 
“The 

Looming 
Tower”) 
and 

abusive 
American 
Colonel 

Richard Strickland (Michael 
Shannnon, “Pottersville”). Del 
Toro expands on his choice for 
the Cold War as a backdrop and 
what details the setting offers.

“I think that movies that 

happen 
anywhere, 
matter 

nowhere; movies that happen 
anytime, matter at no time. 
Storytellers choose the place 
they take place in, and the 
time they take place in, very 
carefully and very specifically, 
del Toro said. “I think for me 
is of course, the Cold War, and 
the Space Race, of course, but 
it is the last fairy tale time in 
America — a time in which 
America kind of dreams itself 
into what we conceive as the 
modern America. The media 
is shaping the consciousness 
and the identity of the country 
and you have a candidate in 
the White House be a damage 
yet to escalate, and you have 

suburban wealth everywhere: 
cars in every garage, TV, 
kitchens, 
petticoats 
and 

hairspray. It’s really a time of 
great hope for the future. In 
fact, we become so obsessed 
with the idea of the future, 
and I thought that and the 
Cold War were the perfect 
settings to bring a creature 
from the ancient past and a 
love story in a time of difficult 
communication.”

Del Toro’s plain political 

commentary comes from the 
treatment of the Asset, who 
is tortured and abused by 
high-status white men simply 
because they are different. 
He calls it a representation of 
“The Other.”

“Also the movie is a movie 

about our problems today and 
about demonizing The Other 
and about fearing or hating 
The Other, and how that is 
a 
much 
more 
destructive 

position than learning to love 
and understand,” del Toro said. 

“I thought, well, if I thought 

about today, there are two 
topics all over the news, we get 
it in the news, in social media, 
but if I say, ‘Once upon a time, 
this language, we used it too’ — 
this is a fairy tale for troubled 
times, and people can lower 
their guard a little bit more, 
and listen to the story and 
listen to the characters and 
talk about the issues, and the 
circumstance of the issues.”

Something less prominent, 

but equally important, are the 
identities of the characters. 
Protagonist Elisa is mute, but 
her disability does not render 
her character flat. She is still 
presented as a whole human 
being, with adult sexual desires 
and 
emotional 
capabilities. 

The film manages to capture 
her romance with the Asset in 
its fullest sense without verbal 
communication — a feat which 
del Toro detailed in the Q&A.

“The first thing is that I 

think that words can lie but 
looks cannot. I wanted to have 
characters that were able to 
communicate to the audience 
their emotions and their love 
through 
looks, 
touch, 
and 

body language and essence, 
because it’s impossible to talk 
about love,” del Toro said. “You 
can sing about love but you 
cannot talk. And the idea is 
that Sally, the main character 
Elisa, and the creature have 
this in common: They are not 
looked at as complete beings, 
and yet they are. They are 
reduced to ideologies or ideas 
that are more reductive in 
complexity, to the point that 
the creature is actually read 

by different people as different 
things throughout the film. 
For the antagonist Strickland, 
he is read as a filthy thing that 
came from South America; 
for the Russian scientist, he 
is seen as the magic of nature 
and science; to Elisa, he is 
part of her essence, that she 
recognizes. 
And 
for 
Elisa, 

she is read as different things 
for 
different 
characters. 

For Octavia Spencer, she is 
basically a listener to her in 
her monologue; for Giles, she 
is almost like a daughter; and 
for Strickland, she is a woman 
that he wants to dominate, or 
he thinks he controls because 
she is under his employment. 
And she is much more than 
that. The only one that sees 
Elisa exactly as she is, without 
seeing her incomplete, is the 
creature, is this elemental god 
from the Amazon that is as 
much a singularity as she is.

“There is also a monologue 

in the movie, that Elisa has; 
it is a gesture monologue, a 
sign-language 
monologue, 

that 
plays 
much 
stronger 

with her emotions than being 
channeled 
by 
words. 
Her 

eyes are more hungry, there’s 
more emotion, her body — her 
sentiment vibrates through her 
body — and it is really quite a 
powerful scene because she 
cannot talk.”

Between 
amphibian 
sex, 

shoot-outs in the rain and 
deep spiritual poetry, del Toro 
does 
what 
many 
big-name 

Hollywood 
directors 
have 

not: He manages to represent 
marginalized 
identities 

without making it the crutch 
of the whole plot. Elisa might 
be mute, but her disability 
does not affect the voice she 
has in the film; Zelda is a 
Black woman, without being 
the Black woman the film 
depends on to make a political 
statement; Giles is closeted as 
gay, but his sexuality does not 
define his entire presence on 
screen. The characters own 
their identities rather than 
the other way around, and 
the subtle change stands out. 
And when that is all stated 
and acknowledged, there is 
still so much more to take 
apart and analyze — from the 
color choices of the sets and 
costumes to the production 
techniques and inclusion of 
monologues and spoken word. 
When the misrepresentation 
of marginalized communities 
in film are widespread, “The 
Shape of Water” proves one 
very important thing: You can 
still be inclusive and make a 
good movie. Period.

Piazza, Cecconi provide leadership for struggling unit

The Michigan hockey team 

departed Yost Ice Arena on 
Saturday with far more thorns 
than roses.

The 
Wolverines’ 
marred 

defensive 
performance 

was composed of too many 
giveaways, 
too 
many 
goals 

given up and too few meticulous 
passes — problems that were 
only exacerbated by an absent 
offensive spark.

What can get lost in translation 

of this season’s repetitive plot 
is the noteworthy talent of 
individuals in the defensive 
core — in particular, its veteran 
leadership.

Senior 
defenseman 
Sam 

Piazza and junior defenseman 
Joseph Cecconi have emerged 
as 
the 
Wolverines’ 
premier 

defensive pairing on the ice, 
and — as two of four selected 
alternate captains this season 
— have seen their influence 
expanded off of it as well.

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

noted that the defensive unit 
has already had considerable 
success.

“You have confidence putting 

them 
out 
against 
anybody,” 

Pearson said. “Sam is good with 
the puck and handles the puck 
very well. He is not as physical, 
you know, Joe is ‘big and strong 
Joseph’ and can be physical. 
They 
seem 
to 
have 
some 

chemistry together, they play off 
of each other, so they are in sync, 
and that’s important.”

While the Wolverines have 

seen many changes in player 
combinations this year, Piazza 
and Cecconi have remained a 
constant duo. And their talents 
happened to be on display 
this past weekend, which was 
otherwise 
ignominious 
for 

Michigan’s squad.

Friday night, off a cross-

ice pass from Cecconi, Piazza 
knocked in the opening goal of 
the game — good for his first 

of the season. The following 
evening, Cecconi was the lone 
Wolverine to score, equalizing 
the game in the second period 
before Ohio State’s offensive 
onslaught began.

Their 
ability 
to 
step 
up 

on offense while Michigan’s 
forwards struggled to do so 
against the Buckeyes highlighted 
the pair’s versatile strengths.

“Obviously, 
we’ve 
stayed 

together this whole time so far, 
so we’ve been doing something 
right,” Cecconi said. “We talk a 
lot on the ice, off the ice, and we 
have good chemistry. We know 
where the other person is going 
to be, and we both have pretty 
good hockey IQ, so that goes a 
long way.”

Pearson added: “You’ve got to 

play sound defensively first and 
foremost, and then pick your 
spots offensively when you’re 

jumping up in a play. I think for 
the most part, they’ve done a 
good job at that.”

Part of what has made the 

duo cohesive this season is the 
variability in their contributions 
and 
improvements.

For Cecconi, it 

has been his well-
roundedness as a 
player.

Netting 
10 

points 
over 

the 
first 
14 

games, 
Cecconi 

has 
been 
the 

largest offensive 
contributor from 
Michigan’s blue line. He has 
already surpassed his sophomore 
season total of eight points and 
that, paired with his physicality 
and work ethic in the defensive 
zone, has made for a dynamic 

combination. 

Part of Cecconi’s development 

has stemmed from the formative 
experience he had last year, 
playing 
on 
the 
2017 
U.S. 

National Junior Team. During 

his 
sophomore 

season, 
Cecconi 

was 
the 
sole 

Wolverine — and 
just one of 23 
players nationally 
— 
selected 
for 

the team’s final 
roster. 
His 

team went on to 
claim 
the 
gold 

medal 
at 
the 

International Ice 

Hockey Federation World Junior 
Championship in January.

“I think he has grown as a 

player and a leader, and is really 
starting to blossom,” Pearson 
said.

Piazza 
has 
demonstrated 

his talents in another way this 
season — through his ability to 
stand his ground in the defensive 
zone.

The 
senior 
ranks 
eighth 

nationally in blocked shots with 
an average of 2.42 per game, a 
huge reason as to why Michigan 
has found recent success overall 
in shot blocking. Rather than 
laying out to block shots, Piazza 
prefers to stand in a lane and 
disrupt 
the 
opposition 
with 

a good gap and decisive stick 
placement.

“I 
think 
we 
have 

complementing styles,” Piazza 
said. “Chico is really an all-
around good defenseman. And 
I think in the past you would 
have classified him as more of a 
defensive guy, but he has a ton of 
points this year, too. For me, he 
is really easy to play with. You 

always know where he is, which 
is a good thing. I think we play 
well off each other, and it’s been 
a pleasure playing with him.”

In addition to a diverse set of 

skills, the two have seemingly 
polar personalities. Piazza tends 
to be more soft-spoken, while 
Cecconi makes his presence 
known.

But according to Pearson, this 

divergence is a large component 
of what makes the two work, 
particularly when it comes to 
their roles as captains.

“Sam is more of a quiet leader,” 

Pearson said. “He just goes about 
his business, he’s good in the 
classroom, he comes to the rink 
and he plays. He’s a good player. 
He lets his playing do his talking.

“Joseph 
is 
a 
little 
more 

outgoing, with a little more 
energy, and I guess he’s a guy 
that people gravitate to because 
that’s how he is. And that’s why 
they complement each other I 
think, too.”

Both of them know that despite 

their experience and leadership, 
there is still significant room for 
improvement — for themselves 
and the rest of the defensive core. 
And going back hard for pucks, 
crisper clearances and stronger 
communication are all at the top 
of that list.

Yet while players of all ages 

have the capacity for growth, the 
efforts of these older defensemen 
are key in helping younger 
Wolverines develop their own 
game, as they are exposed to 
exemplary defensive styles of 
play.

“They are both older and have 

been around,” Pearson said. 
“I think it’s good (for younger 
players) to take in some things 
— I don’t want to say steal from 
another person — but just to say 
‘Hey, you know what, I want to 
be able to do that, and be like him 
in some ways’, and I think that’s 
a positive.”

Perhaps 
their 
veteran 

leadership will bring Michigan’s 
defense back on the rails.

Michigan can’t recover from early 
deficit in loss to No. 3 Notre Dame

Though 
the 
Michigan 

women’s basketball team won 
the tip, Notre Dame scored first. 
Within the first five minutes, the 
Fighting Irish went up by four, 
and they remained in the driver’s 
seat for the remainder of the 
game.

While the Wolverines once 

held a four-point lead themselves 
in the first quarter, Notre Dame 
peaked in the fourth, taking a 
with a 25-point lead, to finish 
with an 83-63 victory.

Going 
into 
the 
game 

Wednesday night, Michigan had 
two points of emphasis after its 
loss to Louisville: rebounds and 
turnovers.

“Great teams gotta be able 

to rebound and gotta be able to 
take care of the basketball,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “We put both of those 
things together, and I think we 
can compete against the top 
teams.”

The Wolverines turned the 

ball over only once in the first half 
while pulling down 11 rebounds. 
Though Michigan took care of 
the ball, it had a difficult time 
shutting down the Irish.

Junior center Hallie Thome 

accredited the defensive woes 
to the offensive challenge put 
up by Notre Dame’s Arike 
Ogunbowale, who scored 20 
points including four timely 
three-pointers.

“I think it wasn’t like fatigue 

physically, 
I 
think 
it 
was 

mentally— just always having to 
locate Arike and just be aware of 
where everyone is,” Thome said. 
“I think that we all realized that 
we needed to shut down Arike 
and not let her get the ball, so I 
think more of a mental fatigue 
of always having your eye on 
someone.”

Even with a 25-point deficit 

late in the game, Thome insisted 
Michigan never threw in the 
towel.

“No matter what the situation 

is, we’re giving it our all,” Thome 

said. “Even if we’re trying 
everything we can do and it’s 
not working then you have to put 
someone else in that position.”

Even senior guard Katelynn 

Flaherty 
— 
the 
Wolverines’ 

top scorer — was quiet in the 
offensive half as she was being 
double 
teamed 

for a majority of 
the game.

“I just think 

she didn’t have 
an 
open 
look 

the entire night. 
She was double-
teamed 
every 

single time she 
came off a ball 
screen,” Barnes 
said. “They knew 
where she was in transition. 
She had contested shot after 
contested 
shot. 
So 
that’s 

difficult.”

Though 
the 
pressure 
on 

Flaherty was immense, Thome 
was confident in the ability of her 
team to rise to the occasion and 

fill in. Flaherty is a leader for the 
team, but there are other players 
who are capable of stepping up.

“We have other players, I 

know Katelynn will always go 
down in history as one of the 
best players at Michigan but 
basketball is a five person sport 

so other people 
have to step up, 
other 
people 

have 
to 
take 

different roles,” 
Thome said.

Despite 
the 

loss, 
Michigan 

saw 
how 
its 

strong 
play 

in 
the 
first 

half 
allowed 

optimism 
for 

future growth.

“I think we realized we can 

really hang with anyone if we do 
the little things and proceed to 
do the little things as the game 
goes on and don’t get mentally 
fatigued as the game goes on,” 
Thome said.

Flaherty shut down in blowout

In 
blowing 
out 
No. 
22 

Michigan 83-63 at the Crisler 
Center on Wednesday night, 
No. 
3 
Notre 
Dame 
found 

the blueprint to beating the 
Wolverines: 
shut 
Katelynn 

Flaherty down and Michigan’s 
offense grinds to a halt.

The 
senior 

point 
guard 

shot just 5-for-
18 from the field 
and 1-of-7 from 
beyond the arc, 
spending 
the 

night 
trying 

and failing to 
heat 
up 
from 

anywhere 
on 

the court. Not 
coincidentally, 
so did Michigan’s offense. The 
Wolverines scored less than a 
point per possession – 0.926 to 
be exact – as the Irish pulled 
away.

“I just think she didn’t have 

an open look the entire night,” 
said coach Kim Barnes Arico. 

“She was double-teamed every 
single time she came off a ball 
screen. They knew where she 
was in transition. She had 
contested shot after contested 
shot.”

It makes sense that a team 

of Notre Dame’s caliber would 
key in on Flaherty. She’s the 
program’s 
all-time 
leading 

scorer and she averages 23.7 

points 
per 

game. Michigan, 
however, wasn’t 
ready 
for 
the 

Fighting Irish’s 
airtight defense 
and 
Barnes 

Arico knew it.

“I think the 

growth of our 
team is going to 
be – we talked 
a little bit about 

this at halftime, but we didn’t 
get to it in the second half – 
‘Okay, if Katelynn is double-
teamed, can we get the ball out 
of that double-team and make 
extra pass, extra pass enough to 
get an open, uncontested layup 
by someone?’

“And we’re not at the point 

yet of moving the basketball 
at that rate and getting Hallie 
(Thome) – cause a lot of times, 
Hallie was setting the screen, 
Hallie’s girl was doubling – get 
Hallie down to the block, move 
it, move it, move it, get Hallie an 
open layup. But the pressure of 
being double-teamed to make a 
good pass before people rotate – 
it’s gotta be boom, boom, boom, 
boom, boom, boom, boom.”

In all fairness, it is early 

in the year, the Wolverines 
did lose point guard Siera 
Thompson and Flaherty herself 
is still transitioning into the 
position. To the senior’s credit, 
she had eight assists and just 
one turnover on Wednesday.

But this is supposed to be a 

different Michigan team – one 
that can compete against teams 
like Notre Dame – and teams 
like that can’t get taken out of 
rhythm when the first option 
is struggling. The Wolverines 
were in it for most of the game, 
but it never felt like the offense 
was good enough to overcome 
the 10-point deficit that was 
present from the first quarter 
on.

It wasn’t and at the start of 

the fourth, 10 turned into 20 
and Michigan lost the chance 
to come back.

Outside of postups from 

Thome, the Wolverines simply 
didn’t have other means of 
scoring. They shot an abysmal 
36.5 percent from the field 
and 35.7 percent from three. 
Freshman 
forward 
Hailey 

Brown was the only player other 
than Thome and Flaherty to hit 
double-digit scoring and she 
did so on 4-of-11 shooting. The 
offense was stagnant at times 
and Notre Dame constantly 
closed off driving lanes.

“I think what happens – and 

it’s not Katelynn’s fault – I think 
everyone else stops and looks 
at Katelynn to make a play,” 
Barnes Arico said. “And when 
you have a really great player 
on your team, sometimes the 
rest of the team defers to her.”

On 
Wednesday, 
that 

happened most of the time. In 
the future, it can’t.

Poor rebounding, 
defense sinks ‘M’

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — It 

was a play that the Michigan 
basketball team has practiced 
defending hundreds of times. 

Early in the second half 

of the Wolverines’ 86-71 loss 
Wednesday, 
North 
Carolina’s 

Joel Berry II called for a screen at 
the top of the key. Forward Luke 
Maye obliged, setting the screen 
and rolling to the basket.

The two Michigan defenders 

involved — freshman point guard 
Eli Brooks and fifth-year senior 
forward Duncan Robinson — 
both switched to the ball handler. 

Berry then dribbled his way 

into space and found Maye for an 
open dunk, inciting roars in the 
Dean Dome. 

On a night when the Tar Heels 

shot 55 percent from the floor, 
those types of mistakes were 
common in what amounted to 
the Wolverines’ worst defensive 
performance of the year. 

“Just 
(not 
enough) 
grit,” 

Brooks said. “(We weren’t) able 
to get down and dirty.”

After scoring just 45 points 

against then-No. 4 Michigan 
State on Sunday, the Tar Heels 
connected for 51 points on 
65-percent shooting in the first 
half — a disastrous frame for 
Michigan defensively.

“I don’t think we were ready 

for the quickness with the speed 
and precision that they run with,” 
Beilein said. “We just weren’t 
locked in. … We laid an egg for 
most of the first half defensively.”

Part of the issue was the 

Wolverines’ inability to match up 
with Maye, who led the floor with 
27 points on 11-for-16 shooting. 

And when that mismatch was 

combined with ball movement 
and the sharp-shooting of guard 
Kenny Williams, North Carolina 
had a formula too potent for the 
Wolverines. 

“Yeah, they were really moving 

the ball well,” said Michigan 
coach John Beilein. “Luke Maye 

is a really tough matchup for us. 
We’re playing really small with 
Duncan Robinson as a skinny-
four man. This was really a bad 
matchup, and it really hurt us.”

But 
even 
when 
Michigan 

executed defensively, the Tar 
Heels’ skill persisted. 

Midway through the first half, 

Berry drove from the key and got 
a step on sophomore point guard 
Zavier Simpson. Simpson, in an 
impressive showing of quick feet, 
caught up to cut off Berry — only 
for the former Final Four MVP to 
jump, lean back and kiss an eight-
footer off the glass. 

“They 
didn’t 
miss 
shots,” 

Beilein said. “They’re not as well-
oiled as they were last year yet, 
but they’ve got really good talent.” 

But when the Tar Heels did 

miss, their talent was further 
magnified by their persistent 
second chances. 

Michigan allowed 20 points 

off 10 offensive boards and lost 
the overall rebounding margin, 
37-31. 

“They just did a great job of 

getting second shots off offensive 
boards,” Beilein said. “We just 
weren’t good.”

Added 
Brooks: 
“I 
think 

just the physicality (was most 
disappointing). Being able to 
command the glass, and just 
not playing physical inside. It 
comes with the guards, even 
those inside. We’ve got to get a 
rebound, we didn’t do a good job 
of rebounding, and that hurt us. 
We just didn’t have enough dogs 
out there to fight and compete on 
the glass.”

Despite Michigan’s offensive 

struggles Wednesday, it still 
could 
have 
competed 
with 

the Tar Heels. Poor defense 
and rebounding lapses simply 
delivered the punches that left 
the Wolverines bruised by the 
game’s end.

“It’s one that we’ve got to 

grow from,” Beilein said. “But 
I’m disappointed that some of 
the veterans right now weren’t as 
gritty as they’ve been in the past.” 

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Michigan can’t answer Tar Heels’ punches 

CHAPEL 
HILL, 
N.C. 
— 

Duncan Robinson ran ahead of 
the pack. 

He had the ball in his hands, 

and with it, an opportunity to 
provide an answer to another 
punch 
that North 
Carolina 
(5-1) 
had 

thrown at the Michigan men’s 
basketball team (6-2).

The 13th-ranked Tar Heels’ 

two stars, guard Joel Berry and 
forward Luke Maye, had just hit 
a three and a two, respectively, 
to give North Carolina a 34-29 
lead with about seven minutes 
left.

Robinson 
fought 
off 
a 

defender with his off-hand, 
gathered the ball with his right 
hand and missed the layup off 
the right side of the rim.

The Tar Heels ran the other 

way, and forward Theo Pinson 
finished the sequence with an 
acrobatic reverse layup.

From there, the Wolverines 

never found an answer and 
were dominated in an 86-71 loss 
Wednesday night.

“Exactly what I thought 

this team’s weakness would be 
this year is when we needed 
somebody to settle down and 
make a play,” said Michigan 
coach 
John 
Beilein. 
“We 

weren’t ready to make a smart 
play at that time. It would turn 
into hero basketball, and it 
would end up (creating) offense 
for them. That’s exactly what 
happened.”

Added 
junior 
forward 

Moritz Wagner: “It was very 
disappointing, the way we put 
our heads down once we got 
down 10. Instead of making it 
a tough game, all of a sudden, it 
looked like a blowout.”

After amassing a 14-point 

lead heading into the halftime 
break, North Carolina flexed 
its muscles at the outset of 
the second half. It went on a 
16-2 run that included and-
one dunks, open layups and 
bruising post moves that blew 
the game wide open.

Beilein 

shuffled lineups 
often, but none 
of the rotations 
yielded 
strong 

results, 
and 

his team shot 
a meager 35.1 
percent from the 
floor in the final 
20 minutes. 

“I don’t know 

who those next 
guys are,” Beilein said. “We’re 
trying to figure it out, and that’s 
why we said, ‘To heck with the 

second half. Heck, you’re down 
30. Let’s let the young guys 
play.’ ”

Though the game ended in a 

blowout, it didn’t seem like that 
would be the case early. At that 
point, everything was falling 
for both teams.

The Wolverines made their 

first eight shots. 
The eighth came 
on a fadeaway, 
bank-in 
three-

pointer 
from 

redshirt 
junior 

forward Charles 
Matthews. 
Michigan 
took 

the Tar Heels’ 
repeated blows 
until there were 
eight 
minutes 

left in the first half.

Then, as North Carolina 

stomped its foot on the pedal, 

the Wolverines couldn’t keep 
up. Robinson missed his layup, 
and the rest of the team missed 
nearly everything else.

Michigan will return home 

Saturday for its Big Ten opener 
against Indiana. It will be an 
opportunity for the Wolverines 
to forget a game that could have 
been a launching pad for the 
rest of their season.

But it wasn’t, and like they 

were 
on 
Wednesday 
when 

everything was going wrong, 
Michigan is still looking for 
somebody who can step up and 
right the ship.

“I think the most important 

thing … is that we can’t sit in 
the locker room and have our 
heads down, because that’s 
weakness,” 
Wagner 
said. 

“That’s my big point, and I 
think our coaching staff’s going 
to take care of the rest.”

2017 Season in Review: Tight ends, fullbacks

With the Michigan football 

team’s 2017 regular season in the 
books, the Daily looks back at the 
performance of each unit this year 
and looks ahead to the future in 
2018. In this edition: tight ends 
and fullbacks.

Ever since Jake Butt became an 

integral part to Jim Harbaugh’s 
offense, everyone knew tight 
ends would be a featured position 
in Michigan’s system for seasons 
to come. 

Butt, a former All-American, 

would obviously be hard to 
replace, but two frontrunners 
emerged 
as 
the 
Wolverines’ 

leading tight ends. They did a fair 
job making up for Butt’s absence.

Sophomore tight end Sean 

McKeon led the team with three 
receiving 
touchdowns, 
and 

finished the regular season as the 
team’s second-leading receiver 
with 285 yards. McKeon was a 
frequent target for both redshirt 
freshman quarterback Brandon 
Peters 
and 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback John O’Korn.

The 
team’s 
third-leading 

receiver — behind wideout Grant 
Perry and McKeon — was another 
tight end. Redshirt sophomore 
Zach Gentry collected 276 yards 
and two touchdowns.

It 
was 
the 
first 
season 

that 
Gentry 
and 
McKeon 

saw significant playing time, 
and the pair both served as 
reliable targets for Michigan’s 
quarterbacks.

The Wolverines had little luck 

in the air this year — O’Korn and 
Peters couldn’t hit receivers on 
the deep ball very often — but 
they continuously hit McKeon 
or Gentry rolling off of the line. 
Those passes were much easier 
to make, and the quarterbacks 
utilized them regularly.

At 
the 
fullback 
position, 

Michigan 
saw 
the 
same 

contributions for the most part 
that it had the year before.

When Michigan needed a 

short gain, either for a first-down 
conversion or a touchdown push, 
fifth-year senior Khalid Hill was 
there to punch it home.

The ‘Hammering Panda,’ as 

his nickname goes, had three 
touchdowns this season on just 
17 rushing attempts. In contrast, 
the team’s two main running 
backs each ran the ball over 120 
times.

Hill’s efficiency proved to be 

important again this season for 
Michigan.

HIGH POINT: One of the best 

fullback moments of the year 
actually came on a play where 
Michigan chose not to hand the 
ball to Khalid Hill.

In College Park, from second-

and-goal on the three-yard line, 
Peters handed the ball to fifth-
year senior fullback Henry Poggi. 
Poggi, a Maryland native, dove 
across the goal line and scored 
his first career touchdown. His 
fellow fifth-year senior center 
Patrick Kugler and senior left 
tackle 
Mason 
Cole 
quickly 

surrounded him in celebration.

The score was not only Poggi’s 

first Michigan touchdown, but 
also his first rush attempt of the 
entire season. He wasn’t used 
as often as Hill or freshman 

fullback Ben Mason, but Poggi’s 
touchdown against the Terrapins 
gave him a highlight moment to 
look back on.

The Maryland game also saw 

positives from the tight ends, as 
both McKeon and Gentry scored 
touchdowns. 
McKeon’s 
came 

on a short three-yard rollout, 
his only catch of the game, but 
Gentry racked up 63 receiving 
yards on three catches to boost 
the Wolverines to a road win.

LOW POINT: One tight end 

in particular never fully showed 
his worth.

Sophomore 
Nick 
Eubanks 

opened the season with two 
catches for 61 yards against 
Florida, but didn’t catch another 
pass all season after falling 
victim to injury.

Harbaugh 
never 
disclosed 

what that injury was specifically, 
but the Wolverines certainly lost 
a weapon without him on the 
field.

THE FUTURE: At fullback, 

the future is in the hands of Ben 
Mason. Recruited as a linebacker 
out 
of 
high 
school, 
Mason 

converted to fullback. Harbaugh 
even said he was “born to play” 
the fullback position.

Mason 
brings 
a 
lot 
to 

Michigan’s run game. He’ll be 
crucial in blocking, which he 
displayed an ability for midway 
through the season when he 
barreled a Rutgers player 10 
yards into the end zone to pave 
the way for the Wolverines’ 
running back.

Mason 
was 
the 
only 

underclassman fullback to see 
playing time this year, and his role 
will likely expand going forward 
as Hill and Poggi move on.

For the tight ends, not much 

is going to change in 2018. 
Gentry and McKeon will both 
be back, and in addition, redshirt 
sophomore Tyrone Wheatley Jr. 
and Eubanks, who both made 
contributions this year, could see 
additional playing time.

Ultimately, 
the 
tight 
end 

carousel revolves quickly. Gentry 
and McKeon rode it all this year, 
but with Eubanks back and 
healthy, wherever the carousel 
stops turning, the Wolverines 
will be just fine.
