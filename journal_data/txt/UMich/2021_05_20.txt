This article is the first part of a two-

part investigation by The Michigan 
Daily’s Focal Point team into allegations 
of sexual misconduct against computer 
science professor Walter Lasecki and 
the University of Michigan’s handling of 
these allegations. It is based on emails, 
documents, notes and interviews with 
12 individuals knowledgeable of these 
events.

Content Warning: Sexual harassment 

and misconduct
T

wo investigations into four 
allegations of sexual misconduct 
against University of Michigan 

computer science professor Walter 
Lasecki began in November 2019. One 
was conducted by the University’s 
Office of Institutional Equity (OIE). 
The other was conducted by the 
Association for Computing Machinery 
(ACM), a prominent computer science 
research association. 

Despite 
receiving 
the 
same 

allegations, the two investigations 
reached vastly different conclusions.

OIE’s investigation ended on July 13 

2020, with the finding that Lasecki’s 
behavior in all four cases did not violate 
the University’s sexual harassment 
policy, Standard Practice Guide 201.89 
and with no sanctions against Lasecki. 
ACM, however, concluded in February 

2021 that Lasecki had violated its Policy 
Against Harassment, and Lasecki was 
banned from ACM events for at least 
five years.

Hired to the University in 2015, 

Lasecki is an assistant professor in the 
Computer Science and Engineering 
(CSE) department of the College of 
Engineering. He also held a position in 
the School of Information until March 
2020.

Three of the allegations against 

Lasecki came from non-University 
affiliated 
graduate 
students 
and 

involved 
his 
conduct 
at 
social 

gatherings and industry conferences 
from 2016 to 2019. The fourth allegation 
came from a student at the University, 
who alleges she had been harassed on 
campus, off campus and at industry 
events.

The 
four 
students 
requested 

anonymity in interviews with The 
Michigan 
Daily, 
citing 
Lasecki’s 

prominence in the industry and their 
fears of professional retribution.

All the allegations shared common 

characteristics: while joining the 
students for drinks, Lasecki allegedly 
made statements that made the 
students feel uncomfortable. In at least 
six instances, he allegedly touched 
them sexually.

Lasecki did not respond to multiple 

email requests for comment from 
The Daily. He denied all allegations of 
sexual harassment and misconduct in 
statements to OIE. 

In a statement to The Daily on May 

14, University spokesperson Rick 
Fitzgerald declined to discuss the 
specifics of this case, citing issues of 
confidentiality. 

“It is university policy not to publicly 

discuss personnel matters out of 
respect for employee privacy. That also 
means we are unable to discuss details 
of any matters that may be reported to 
the Office for Institutional Equity for 
review,” Fitzgerald wrote.

When asked if Lasecki would be 

returning to the University to teach in 
Fall 2021, Fitzgerald wrote that “there 
has been no final determination at this 
time.” 

The allegations against Lasecki are 

not the first to rock the University’s 
Computer Science and Engineering 
department. In Feb. 2020, an article 
in The Verge uncovered numerous 
previously 
undisclosed 
allegations 

of sexual harassment against CSE 
faculty member and former Clinc CEO 
Jason Mars, who continues to teach 
courses in the CSE department despite 
pushback from students and faculty. 
In January 2021, CSE faculty member 
Peter Chen — and interim chair of the 
department from January to July 2020 
— was placed on leave after criminal 
sexual misconduct charges of the first 
degree with a victim under 13 years old 
were filed against him. 

University spokesperson Fitzgerald 

offered a brief summary of the College 
of 
Engineering’s 
commitment

addressing matters of culture and 
inclusivity in a statement to The Daily.

“CSE is committed to fostering 

an inclusive environment, where all 
community members feel safe and 
welcome,” Fitzgerald wrote. “Efforts 
to broaden participation and improve 
climate in CSE have been underway 
for years, including mechanisms to 
improve climate, educate employees 
and students on inclusivity, increase 
representation and remove roadblocks. 
These can be seen in detail in the 
annual DEI Climate Report.”

Fitzgerald also highlighted a specific 

initiative by Alec Gallimore, dean of the 
College of Engineering, to improve the 
CSE department’s climate. This group, 
known as the CSE Climate Assessment 
Committee, investigates and manages 
the department’s culture, according to 
Fitzgerald. 

The formation of this committee 

came after faculty members called for 
its creation in a Feb. 1, 2021 open letter. 
According to Fitzgerald, this climate 
assessment will be led by a third-party 
and a final report will be released this 
summer.

“CSE has not demonstrated that it 

can fully resolve culture and climate 
issues internally, and CSE would 
benefit from outside perspectives,” the 
open letter reads. “Michigan conducts 
program reviews for internal academic 
improvement. We propose a regular 
climate-related program review for 
CSE, similar to such academic or 
graduate program reviews.”

Sexual harassment and misconduct 

allegations 
at 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan are not unique to the College 
of Engineering. The School of Music, 
Theater and Dance has seen allegations 
against two former professors Stephen 
Shipps and David Daniels, while the 
School of Literature, Science and 
the Arts has seen allegations against 
English professor Douglas Trevor and 
former American Culture professor 
Bruce Conforth.

In January 2020, Provost Martin 

Philbert — who previously oversaw 
OIE — was placed on leave and later 
resigned after multiple allegations 
of sexual harassment against him 
were reported to the University. The 
allegations were later investigated and 
corroborated by law firm WilmerHale. 
Another WilmerHale investigation 
released earlier this month found 
hundreds of credible allegations of 
sexual abuse against former University 
doctor Robert Anderson over a 37-year 
period. The Anderson report concluded 
that the allegations represent a 
“devastating pattern” of abuse that was 
known to University officials.

The Ann Arbor City Council will 

vote on the proposed city budget 
for fiscal year 2022 at the council 
meeting on Monday night. A meeting 
was held on May 3 for residents to 
express thoughts and concerns about 
the roughly $470 million proposed 
budget. Covering issues ranging from 
policing to deer population control, 
the proposed budget contains many 
hotly contested items. 

Police 
The budget includes $155,000 

for the Ann Arbor Independent 
Community 
Police 
Oversight 

Commission (ICPOC), which serves 
as a bridge between residents and the 
Police Department.

The ICPOC was established in 2019, 

partly in response to the fatal shooting 
of Aura Rosser, a Black woman with 
mental illness, by Ann Arbor police.

At the May 3 meeting, Ward 5 

resident Ralph McKee urged the 
council to follow recommendations 
from the ICPOC as well as Dr. Lisa 
Jackson, chair of the ICPOC, who also 
spoke at the beginning of the council 
meeting. 

“I would really urge you to really 

engage (Dr. Jackson) in depth on 
(police funding),” McKee said. “She 
has really studied that. Many of the 
rest of us are what I would call part-
timers on that issue. We’re interested 
in it, but we really haven’t studied it to 
the level she and other activists have.”

Many Ann Arbor residents want 

to see mental health professionals, 
not police, respond to emergency 
calls when appropriate. City Council 
passed a resolution in April asking the 
City Administrator to create plans for 

an unarmed first responder program 
for mental health crises in Ann Arbor.

At the meeting, Ward 2 resident 

Jeremiah Simon said he wants to see 
police funding redirected to mental 
health professionals.

“The current budget proposal 

increases the police budget from 
$30.7 million to $31.4 million from 
2021 to 2022,” Simon said. “The city 
should shift responsibility for mental 
health and substance use crisis 
response away from the police, and 
therefore should shift money to a new, 
autonomous, unarmed crisis response 
program.”

City 
Councilmember 
Kathy 

Griswold, D-Ward 2, told The 
Michigan Daily she supports having 
unarmed mental health professionals 
with proper oversight and training 
respond to appropriate emergency 
calls.

“The county is responsible for the 

911 Dispatch… (if we) say we want 
to be treated differently you have to 
have the dispatcher know when to 
send out a police officer and when to 
send out an unarmed mental health 
professional,” Griswold said. “That’s 
going to be difficult, but it’s going to 
be possible. We have to have a lot of 
training and a very clearly defined 
implementation plan.”

Ann Arbor resident Michelle 

Hughes called in to the Council 
meeting to show her support of 
increasing the amount of money 
for unarmed responders which is 
currently at $234,000.

“We should have more money spent 

on unarmed responders this year, 
shifting the enforcement of traffic 
things away from the police,” Hughes 
said. “The amount that we have on our 
budget for the new unarmed response 
program is not zero, and I very much

Leaders 
of 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
Central 
Student 

Government (CSG), including its 
president and vice president, issued a 
statement via the CSG Instagram page 
on Monday condemning Israel’s recent 
actions in the ongoing Palestine-Israel 
conflict.

The statement was released after 

reports of the deaths of over 30 
Palestinians, including ten children, 
due to Israeli airstrikes in Gaza 
City. The attack came after rockets 
launched from the Gaza Strip reached 
the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. 

The statement was signed by 

CSG President Nithya Arun, CSG 
Vice President Carla Voigt, CSG DEI 
Coordinator Zaynab Elkolaly, CSG 
Cabinet Member Eman Naga, LSA 
Student Government Vice President 
Zackariah Farah, SAFE, the Arab 
Student Association (ASA) and the 
Muslim Student Association (MSA). It 
was not approved as a resolution by the 
CSG Assembly.

In the statement, the CSG leaders 

said Israel is responsible for the death 
and destruction of the Palestinian 
people and property since the state of 
Israel was established by the United 
Nations in 1948. 

“For the past 73 years, this 

violence 
has 
displaced, 
harmed, 

and killed indigenous Palestinians,” 
the statement reads. “This is not a 
‘conflict,’ but emblematic of Israeli 
settler colonialism, ethnic cleansing, 
and apartheid.” 

The CSG leaders went on to 

claim that anti-Palestinian and pro-
Israel sentiments were rampant 
in our campus community. The 
statement acknowledges that CSG has 

participated in pro-Israel events, such 
as funding yearly trips to Israel for 
Jewish students. 

“We also must recognize CSG’s 

prior complicity with Israel’s violence 
through participation in events such 
as yearly trips to Israel that supported 
the settler-state in its apartheid and 
occupation,” the statement reads.

The CSG leaders ended their 

statement by calling on the University 
to divest from Israeli companies and 
by vowing to use their platform to 
uplift and represent Palestinian voices 
and work with Palestinian student 
groups, such as Students Allied For 
Freedom and Equality (SAFE). 

“The 
University 
of 
Michigan 

remains complicit by choosing not 
to divest from Israeli companies 
profiting 
off 
the 
settler 
state’s 

occupation,” the statement reads. “As 
such, CSG is determined to correct 
these wrongs by working with SAFE 
and other organizations advocating 
for Palestinian liberation to curate 
actionable steps that will be released at 
a later date.” 

The statement comes less than 

five years after CSG voted against 
calling on the University to divest their 
investments from Israeli companies 
in 2016. CSG passed a resolution in 
2017 calling on the University to form 
a committee to look into divesting 
from said Israeli companies, but that 
resolution was ultimately rejected by 
the Board of Regents. 

Student reactions
The 
statement 
drew 
mixed 

reactions 
from 
the 
campus 

community, with some believing that 
the statement was biased and one-
sided, and others believing that CSG 
did what was necessary to support

The Ann Arbor City Council is set to vote on a proposed $470 million budget Monday 
night.

zero than I would like it to be.” 

Pedestrian Safety
Ann 
Arbor’s 
Healthy 
Streets 

program which aims to provide safe 
options for pedestrians and bikers in 
the city was of particular concern to 
residents.

The program, which was designed 

to allow for proper social distancing 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
was first passed by City Council 
in July of 2020. The city employed 
several methods to increase outdoor 
recreational space for pedestrians, 
including street closures, sidewalk 
space expansion, new bike lanes and 

reducing vehicle lanes. 

At the Council meeting, Ann 

Arbor resident Shannon Hautamaki 
said paying for the Healthy Streets 
initiative is vital for the wellbeing of 
children in Ann Arbor.

“For 
families 
with 
young 

children, I don’t see a return to 
normalcy happening that quickly. 
Vaccines for young children are still 
several months, if not a year away,” 
Houtamaki said. “Children will have 
to do most of their socializing outside

The 
Food 
and 
Drug 

Administration and Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
issued a joint statement on April 13, 
recommending an immediate pause 
on administering the Johnson and 
Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine 
“out of an abundance of caution.” The 
ensuing 11-day pause was a result of 
six reported cases in which women 
ranging from 18 to 48 years of age 
experienced severe blood clots — a 
new condition known as thrombosis 
with thrombocytopenia syndrome 
(TTS) — less than two weeks after 
receiving the Johnson and Johnson 
vaccine. By the time the vaccine had 
been brought to a halt, 6.8 million 
doses of the vaccine had already been 
administered in the U.S. 

The J&J vaccine is one of three 

CDC-authorized and recommended 
COVID-19 vaccinations, along with 
the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. 
The J&J vaccine is currently only 
approved for those 18 and over and 
was reported as 66.3% effective in 
clinical trials at preventing COVID-
19 two weeks after vaccination, 
compared to Pfizer and Moderna, 
which were 95% and 94.1% effective 
respectively.

Despite the lower efficacy, the J&J 

vaccine was 100% effective in trials 
against hospitalizations and death 
from COVID-19. Unlike the Pfizer 
and Moderna vaccinations, the J&J 
vaccination does not need to be stored 
at sub-zero temperatures and is 
administered in one shot rather than 
two. The single required shot makes 
administration 
and 
distribution 

easier for communities with limited 
access to health resources and may 
be more attractive to individuals with 
needle anxiety or busy schedules.

Less than a week before the 

recommended pause of the J&J 
vaccine, University President Mark 
Schlissel sent out an email to the 
campus community announcing that 
7,500 doses of the J&J vaccine would 
be available for students to receive at 
locations across the three University 
of Michigan campuses at no cost.

After the recall was announced, 

student appointments for the J&J 
vaccine were either switched to Pfizer 

vaccine or cancelled altogether.

On April 23, Martino Harmon, vice 

president of student life, announced 
that being fully vaccinated against 
COVID-19 would be required for 
all students living in on-campus 
housing for the Fall 2021 semester. 
The University said students are 
considered fully vaccinated two 
weeks after receiving a single dose 
vaccine — like J&J — or two weeks 
after receiving the second shot in a 
two-dose vaccine series.

On that same day, the FDA and 

CDC put out an additional statement 
lifting the pause on the J&J vaccine, 
publicly reaffirming that it is both safe 
and effective. 

As of May 14, including the six 

reported cases before the pause, there 
have been 28 total confirmed cases of 
TTS — six of them males. All of them 
were individuals who had recently 
received the J&J vaccine, and three 
patients died as a result.

Campus 
community 
remains 

confident in Johnson and Johnson 
vaccine safety

Although there were concerns 

regarding the J&J vaccine’s safety 
after the recall, a national poll 
conducted by the de Beaumont 
Foundation reported that 76% of 
those surveyed were just as likely 
to get a COVID-19 vaccine as they 
were before the pause. Additionally, a 
Kaiser Family Foundation poll found 
that only 18% of Hispanic women, 
11% of Black men and 7% of white 
women said the news regarding the 
TTS cases made them less likely to get 
vaccinated.

U-M students have also expressed 

minimal concern about the recall 
of J&J or campus vaccination 
requirements. As of May 13, Michigan 
Medicine had administered over 
126,000 COVID-19 vaccines with no 
signs of slowing down. 

LSA sophomore Sophie Rogoff 

received the J&J vaccine prior to the 
recall and said she has no concerns 
about the safety of the vaccine. She 
mentioned her experience with 
using birth control, which the FDA 
states has between a 0.09% and 0.3% 
chance of causing blood clots. The 
risk of developing TTS after receiving 
the J&J vaccine is significantly lower 
than the blood clots occasionally 
caused by birth control.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com NEWS

University of Michigan President 

Mark Schlissel announced on Apr. 23 
that any students who decide to live in 
on-campus housing for the 2021-2022 
school year must be fully vaccinated 
to be eligible for housing. Students 
planning to live in the residence halls 
must provide proof of vaccination by 
July 15, barring limited exemptions 
that have not yet been laid out.

A large contingent of higher 

education institutions have set forth 
vaccination requirements for their 
students, while other universities 
and colleges are reluctant to mandate 
vaccines due to legal and ethical 
reasons. 

In an email to The Michigan 

Daily, Dr. Robert Ernst, Associate 
Vice President for Student Life and 
Executive Director of the University 
Health Service, wrote that the 
University will accept COVID-19 
vaccinations 
that 
are 
approved 

by the United States Food and 
Drug Administration or the World 
Health Organization. The accepted 
vaccines currently include the Pfizer 
BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & 
Johnson/Janssen, and AstraZeneca 
(Covishield) vaccines.

The 
University 
recommends 

that all students, regardless of living 
location, upload proof of their COVID-
19 vaccination to Wolverine Access 
before the beginning of the fall 
semester. Ernst said this information 
will be used to inform plans for the 
fall. 

Ernst said that Michigan Housing 

is working on a specific plan for how 
exemptions will be managed and 
will share this information soon. 
Students who are vaccinated will not 
be required to adhere to on-campus 
testing requirements in the fall 
semester.

“This (vaccine) information will 

be used to protect our community in 
many ways, including waived testing 
and quarantine requirements, social 
distancing needs, public health-
informed housing decisions and 
administrative planning,” Ernst said.

Professor Emeritus Peter Jacobson, 

professor of health law and policy, said 
that although the vaccines did not 
go through the normal three-phase 
process of approval, they are still safe 
and effective. 

“Nothing is perfect, but just think of 

it this way: a little over a year ago, the 

hope was that in two years, we would 
have a vaccine that might be effective 
at the 50% level,” Jacobson said. “We 
now have, in one year, a vaccine that’s 
effective in the 95% level.” 

Regardless of the public concern, 

Jacobson said the vaccine mandate at 
the University will protect the overall 
community as long as the University 
gives students and staff of different 
socioeconomic backgrounds equal 
access to the vaccine. Jacobson said 
he is a firm believer in vaccinating 
everyone, with the exception of 
certain students and staff due to 
medical reasons. 

“You’re in a small community,” 

Jacobson said. “You’re in dorms, 
you’re in classes, you’re exposing 
professors. You’re exposing U-M 
staff. It seems to me that the 
University has every right to protect 
itself.”

Some critics argue that vaccine 

mandates are a violation of the 
Nuremberg 
code, 
which 
was 

created after World War II to 

protect people from non-consensual 
experimentation. 
Jacobson 
said 

the vaccines are not experimental 
because there is concrete evidence the 
vaccines are not harmful to human 
beings. 

“How do you then have so few side 

effects after millions of doses — after 
a hundred million doses — in the U.S., 
two hundred million shots in the 
U.S.?” Jacobson said.

J. Scott Roberts, professor of health 

behavior and health education, said 
each university should set policies 
according to the needs of their specific 
community. One example of this, 
according to Roberts, is the execution 
of soft mandates, where colleges set 
consequences for students and staff 
who do not get vaccinated, such as 

increased testing and mask wearing. 

“Given the politicized environment 

we’re in, there is this threat of backlash 
and I think before we go there, we 
should consider there’s a lot of options 
on a continuum here,” Roberts said. 

Additionally, Roberts said, clear 

and early communication to all 
campus community members is 
vital to the peaceful enforcement of 
vaccine requirements on the U-M 
campus.

“Historically, there was great 

trust in government public health, 
and even reasonable trust in the 
pharmaceutical industry not so long 
ago, but you think both of those 
actors have suffered from a loss of 
public trust,” Roberts said. 

International Students
Even if international students 

arriving on campus in the fall are 
unable to get vaccinated in their home 
country, Ernst said the University will 
provide easy access to vaccination. 
The University has partnered with 
Michigan Medicine, the Washtenaw 

County Health Department and 
several local pharmacies to help the 
campus community get vaccinated. 
Ernst said students who arrive on 
campus 
unvaccinated, 
including 

international students who were 
not able to get vaccinated before the 
fall, will be expected to undergo 
surveillance testing until they are 
fully vaccinated.

At the time of publication, 12.2% 

of people living in China have been

OPINION

I 

once had an interaction with 
my high school physics teacher 
that has stuck with me ever 

since. During one of the weekly 
chats we’d have in her classroom 
after school, I wondered out loud 
why neither evolution nor the Big 
Bang theory were covered in the 
biology or physics curricula. My 
teacher explained to me that being 
in a town drenched in parochial 
ideology, there was a don’t ask, don’t 
tell policy covering the teaching 
of evolution. Science instructors 
were encouraged to not teach the 
subject and to only field questions 
when asked. While not surprising 
to me in light of the culture of my 
hometown — Ortonville, Mich. — it 
was infuriating to know that social 
pressure was pushing my science 
teachers to avoid evolution in their 
general science courses. No law was 
restricting them. Only the fear of 
becoming a social pariah was in the 
way of them providing students with 
a scientifically complete education. 

What 
is 
happening 
in 
my 

hometown is not an anomaly in the 
contemporary United States. A 2019 
survey reported that only 67% of 
public high school biology teachers 
present Charles Darwin’s theory 
of evolution by natural selection 
as the scientific consensus. This 
is an increase from past surveys, 
but still quite low given that the 
theory of evolution is one of the 
most championed theories in all 
of biology. One out of every three 
teachers is not portraying evolution 
by natural selection as the robust 
scientific theory that it is — a theory 
that has been fortified with new 
evidence every year since it was first 
proposed. This presents obstacles to 
students who wish to further their 
science education at postsecondary 
institutions. More worrisome is 
that evolution denial propagates 
ignorance and scientific illiteracy — 
issues all the more pertinent in light 
of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Legal prohibitions on the public 

instruction of evolutionary theory 
do not hold anymore, but teachers’ 
apprehension 
about 
teaching 

evolution as agreed-upon science 
indicates that traditionalist mores 
still weigh down the American public 
education system. Bans on teaching 
evolution in public schools is as old 
as the theory itself. One of the first 
major conflicts between scientific 

educators and conservative policy 
makers in U.S. history was the 
Scopes Trial of 1925. This legal case 
concerned a Tennessee public school 
teacher who taught evolutionary 
theory despite a Tennessee law 
prohibiting instruction of human 
evolution in any school that received 
state funding. This trial catalyzed 
the debate between creationism and 
evolutionary theory. From then on, 
legal challenges to the instruction 
of evolution and natural selection in 
public schools have been mounted 
by many Christian groups — usually 
those from evangelical traditions — 
with varying degrees of success. 

Now, I cannot criticize those 

1920s Tennessee creationist policy 
makers too virulently, as at that time 
evolution was not a majority-held 
belief among Christians nor society 
at large. But criticism is warranted 
for contemporary teachers and 
education boards who are still 
reluctant to teach evolutionary 
theory and natural selection in light 
of the now 160 years of evidence — 
including the crucial discovery of 
DNA and genes — that provide robust 
support for evolution. And while I 
understand that some regions of the 
country have intense negative social 
sanctions against anti-creationist 
rhetoric that can be hard for teachers 
to overcome, it is more important that 
teachers plan science curriculum 
around empirical observations than 
socially-pressured traditional beliefs. 

This is not to say that learning 

about religious practice has no room 
in education — just that it does not 
belong in scientific curriculum at 
the expense of silencing scientific 
fact. A more apt place would be in 
the domain of social studies, with an 
emphasis on the diversity of religious 
practice. But having evolutionary 
theory not presented to students 
within 
their 
science 
courses 

promotes widespread ignorance 
and scientific illiteracy, two issues 
detrimental if a society wishes to 
better itself. Denying students the 
knowledge that many biologists view 
as foundational to their discipline 
serves ideology much more than 
it serves education. 

O

n 
Thursday, 
April 
22, 

representatives 
from 

the Graduate Employees’ 

Organization met with University of 
Michigan administrators to discuss 
an important campus free speech 
issue — the right to exercise freedom 
of conscience through the refusal 
of letters of recommendation. The 
discussion revealed the University’s 
policy for what it is: an attack on 
academic freedom designed not 
to protect students or faculty, but 
only to shield the University from 
controversy and liability.

This right has been under attack 

at the University of Michigan since 
2018, when two instructors, in 
separate incidents, declined requests 
for recommendations from students 
wishing to study in Israel. Writing 
these letters would have gone against 
the academic boycott of Israel in 
support of Palestinian human rights, 
 

and both instructors declined them 
for that reason. Even though Professor 
John Cheney-Lippold was exercising 
his constitutional right to free speech, 
University leaders nevertheless issued 
severe sanctions, including the loss of 
his upcoming sabbatical and a denial 
of a merit-based raise for one year. The 
graduate student instructor received a 
formal letter of admonishment from 
her department chair with implied 
threats of dismissal from the graduate 
program if such behavior were to 
happen again. What’s more, President 
Schlissel and then-Provost Martin 
Philbert issued a public statement that 
denounced both instructors. 

The punishment meted out to 

Professor Cheney-Lippold and the 
public statement from the most 
powerful University leaders was 
meant to warn campus faculty of 
the price for academic freedom, and 
potentially had a chilling effect on 
those who might otherwise speak 
out if they did not feel threatened. But 
the University wanted to make sure 
this wouldn’t happen again, so they 
convened a so-called Blue Ribbon 
Panel to devise a policy that would 
govern letters of recommendation.

The resulting policy is a strident 

attack on free speech. It doesn’t 
prohibit instructors from denying 
letters 
of 
recommendation 
for 

political or ethical reasons, but only 
from vocalizing those reasons. This 
did not sit well with GEO members, 
who 
voted 
overwhelmingly 
to 

oppose the policy in our 2020 
contract negotiations. Much has 
been written about “The Palestine 
Exception to Free Speech,” which 
describes the way norms of freedom 
of expression are so often bent to 
exclude those who would speak 
out for justice in Palestine. Despite 
the ongoing assault on Palestinian 
lives and human rights, however, 
our problem with the University’s 
policy on letters of recommendation 
is not just about Palestine. More and 
more, instructors are starting to see 
letters of recommendation as an 
important site of political opposition 
and learning. There is a growing 
movement among mathematicians 
to refuse to write letters for privacy-

violating surveillance organizations, 
like the National Security Agency. 
There is also the longstanding 
trend of declining recommendation 
requests for Teach for America 
applicants. We can think of a whole 
host of objectionable organizations 
— 
ExxonMobil, 
Raytheon, 
U.S. 

Immigration 
and 
Customs 

Enforcement or U.S. Rep. Marjorie 
Taylor Greene’s, R-Ga., congressional 
office — to which an instructor 
may want to vocally refuse to write 
letters of recommendation. Being 
able to voice the reason for denying a 
letter of recommendation is a critical 
component of any boycott, and 
GEO is proud to stand against this 
indefensible policy.

GEO ultimately won a meeting 

with U-M administrators to discuss 
the policy and how it will be 
implemented. The discussion left 
us only with a clearer sense of how 
poorly thought-out and difficult 
to implement the policy is. While 
U-M administrators made repeated 
reference to fears of discrimination 
as justification for the policy, they 
were never able to explain how Teach 
for America applicants could be 
understood as a group that could be 
discriminated against.

Beyond empty promises: The pursuit of systemic change to the University’s 

toxic environment of gender-based violence

Beyond empty promises: Why I signed onto the class 

action lawsuit against U-M for students affected

OPINION

CECIEL ZHONG | SOPHOMORE DUAL-DEGREE 

JOSIE GRAHAM | JUNIOR

Content Warning: This article dis-

cusses gender-based violence, which 
includes but is not limited to sexual vio-
lence.
E 

ngaging in student activism 
was not part of my plan in 2019, 
but like many others, to stay 

calm was to ignore the horror and 
anger caused by the new interim sexu-
al assault and misconduct policy. This 
policy, among other things, allowed 
direct cross-examination for survi-
vors who came forward. Despite the 
outcry, the University of Michigan did 
not change its procedure, insisting to 
wait for former Secretary of Education 
Betsy Devos’s new regulations to come 
out. The University’s position drifted 
with the unstable political climate and 
in turn, allowed survivors of sexual 
violence to be re-traumatized through 
this interim policy.

Administrators claim that they 

“take allegations of sexual miscon-
duct very seriously.” The words seem 

clear: “Sexual misconduct will not be 
tolerated in the University of Michi-
gan community.” However, in the past 
two years, it is hard to count the times 
when high-profile cases on campus 
arose with one hand. The University 
administration has made its stance 
well known through words and state-
ments, but how has institutional 
change truly been implemented so far? 

To look at that we need to under-

stand that sexual assault is about power 
and control. The University, as an insti-
tution, exerts institutional power that 
ostracises survivors through inad-
equate report addressments, resulting 
in institutional betrayal. This pattern 
has been exemplified through high-
profile cases at the University such 
as Robert Anderson, Martin Philbert, 
and David Daniels, to name a few. 
Institutional betrayal created a mass of 
known perpetrators spreading across 
schools and departments, including 
SMTD, EECS, Michigan Athletics, 

Michigan Medicine, and OIE itself, a 
place that everyone was told to go to if 
an incident occurs. Meanwhile, cam-
pus organizers witnessed an apparent 
disconnect between the administra-
tors and the people whom the policy 
directly impacted. What was consis-
tent among the headlines is that the 
University knows of perpetrators at 
the institution, but continues failing 
to act promptly and comprehensively, 
both in retrospect and in foresight.

To “act” would be a series of 

steps toward justice, which includes 
both individually and systemically 
addressing where the failure occurred, 
rethinking and transforming the 
institutional structures and power 
relations that enabled harm. In the 
class-action lawsuit against former 
University of Michigan athletic doctor 
Robert Anderson, that abuse occurred 
years ago is not an excuse for fractional 
justice and no change. 

Appropriate actions extend beyond 

providing verbal support to adopting 
institutional courage, which means 
cherishing the whistleblower, creating 
a culture of transparency, and using 
institutional power to protect commu-
nity members, not assaulters. Despite 
the long-standing myths of false 
reports ruining one’s life, “the alleged” 
seldom face expulsion from the Uni-
versity, as reflected by OIE’s Annual 
Report in 2016, 2017, and 2018. In the 
workplace, three out of four sexual 
misconduct cases go unreported, and 
over 60% of people who committed 
sexual assault are repeated offenders. 
This reality is played out in Philbert’s 
rise in ranks despite years of rumors 
and Anderson’s decades of abuse, 
which harmed hundreds of students.

Statistics and numbers numb me, 

as do all of the released “official state-
ments.” Actions, not words, are the 
true criterion of our community values. 
When protecting survivors is solely 
treated as a checkbox to maintain fed-

eral funding and reputation, the cam-
pus climate will not improve. When 
the Sixth Circuit Court discouraged 
personal confrontation — recom-
mending agents, not students them-
selves to conduct cross-examination 
— but the University’s interim policy 
still maintained to not provide rep-
resentatives for students who need 
them, we ask, how could we count on 
the procedure to be trauma-informed? 
When a professor with pending sexual 
misconduct lawsuits was appointed 
to teach a large course in the upcom-
ing semester without considering the 
community, we ask what the Univer-
sity has learned from the WilmerHale 
report that was released not long ago?

Content Warning: This article dis-

cusses gender-based violence. Gender-
based violence “ … refers to harmful 
acts directed at an individual based 
on their gender. It is rooted in gender 
inequality, the abuse of power and 
harmful norms.”
I

write this article in honor of the 
survivors of gender-based violence 
filing the class-action lawsuit 

against the University of Michigan for 
allowing Robert E. Anderson former U 
of M athletic doctor’s decades of abuse 
to continue unabated and for all other 
survivors of gender-based violence. 
This story belongs to them and to all 
of the survivors who go unheard and 
continue to be failed by oppressive 
systems, which perpetuate violence 
and inequity against marginalized 
groups, on this campus, in this country 
and across the globe.

I am no expert; I do not hold all 

the answers to solve this complex, 
nuanced issue. I write this, first and 
foremost, to call for justice for survi-
vors, a form of justice defined solely 
by them and what they need to heal, 
varying on a case-to-case basis. They 
deserve better. 

To all survivors, thank you for pro-

tecting all of us in filing this suit. The 
University knew of its abuse and failed 

all of you and the rest of our commu-
nity by enabling it. If the University 
cares about its students, it would take 
responsibility for this unimaginable 
injury and validate these survivors. 

Second, I write this as a call to 

myself and all of us to continue to reck-
on with the reality of gender-based 
violence, a reality we construct and 
maintain and to start to think of and 
pursue solutions to deconstruct it. I 
hope this op-ed encourages further 
debate, reflection and action when it 
comes to addressing and dismantling 
the oppressive systems that create 
gender-based violence.

Zoom In. 
Case I: Former U-M provost Martin 

Philbert sexually harassed multiple 
people over two decades throughout 
his entire career at the University, ris-
ing in ranks from professor to Dean 
to Provost, the head of the office that 
oversees cases of gender-based vio-
lence. University officials, including 
President Mark Schlissel, knew of the 
rumors, now proven true, circulating 
about Philbert’s misconduct and failed 
to launch investigations until the 2018-
2019 school year. 

Case II: More than 150 survivors 

have come forward in filing indi-

vidual lawsuits and a class-action 
lawsuit against the University in 
response to the University’s handling 
of sexual abuse of students by former 
athletic doctor Robert E. Anderson 
dating back to the 1960s. The Uni-
versity received over 460 complaints 
against Anderson, starting this Feb-
ruary. Worst of all, former football 
coach Bo Schembechler and former 
athletic director Don Canham knew 
about Anderson’s actions and failed 
to do anything in response at the time. 
Anderson worked until his retirement 
in 2003, despite being demoted for his 
behavior in 1979. 

Case III: The Michigan Daily 

uncovered 40 years of harassment and 
sexual misconduct allegations against 
SMTD faculty Stephen Shipps. 

Case IV: Employees at Clinc, an AI 

start-up, made allegations of sexual 
misconduct against Clinc’s CEO and 
EECS professor Jason Mars; some fac-
ulty wrote a statement calling for Mars 
to take a leave of absence. He taught an 
undergraduate course during the Win-
ter 2021 semester. 

Case V: In 2019, the University 

conducted a survey on sexual miscon-
duct. Critical results include: 12.4% of 
women and 1.7% of men experience 
rape on campus; 20.4% of women and

The month of May brings warmer 

weather and millions of posts under 
the Asian American Pacific Islander 
hashtag across all social media 
platforms. It is AAPI Heritage 
Month, a time for every Asian 
American and Pacific Islander to 
celebrate their respective cultures. 
AAPI commemoration was first 
officially recognized in 1978 as just 
one week in May, and the celebration 
didn’t expand into a month and 
didn’t become annual until 1990. 
At the same time, the U.S. Census 
Bureau was using the Asian Pacific 
Islander label they had used starting 
in the 1980s. However, while the 
Census Bureau separated the two 
groups in the year 2000, the label 
has continued to persist in colloquial 
use and in names such as AAPI 
Heritage Month. From celebrities to 
“woke” corporations and Instagram 
activist accounts, everyone has 
started using the AAPI label, yet the 
term never felt right to me. 

As the word AAPI has risen in 

popularity in recent months, I began 
to wonder if people really had Pacific 
Islanders’ interests in mind when 
they used the AAPI label. I grew up 
in Hawaii, and as I met more people 
from mainland America, I realized 
just how little people know about the 
Pacific Islands. Most of my mainland 
American friends didn’t even know 
the three regions composing the 
Pacific Islands, yet all of a sudden, 
it 
seemed 
like 
everyone 
was 

discussing violence against Asian 
Americans AND Pacific Islanders. 
As I read article after article with 
AAPI in the headline, I noticed that I 
found nearly no quotes from Pacific 
Islanders. I waded through a flood 
of Asian-focused writing until I 
found articles specifically centering 
Pacific Islanders’ opinions on the 
AAPI label.

The AAPI label continues to 

spread 
online 
without 
people 

understanding its flaws. Despite 
comprising half the acronym, Pacific 
Islanders, composed of Polynesian, 
Melanesian and Micronesian ethnic 
groups, are often left out of the 

discussion surrounding AAPI issues. 
In reality, AAPI in most contexts 
just means Asian, more specifically 
East Asian, yet tacks on Pacific 
Islanders like an afterthought. While 
AAPI and Asian American seem 
like innocuous and interchangeable 
terms to us non-Pacific Islanders, our 
carelessness with the label harms the 
Pacific Islander community we claim 
to want to uplift.

In an attempt to be inclusive, the 

use of the AAPI can end up causing 
more harm than good. Pacific 
Islanders are often drowned out 
by the comparatively large influx 
of Asian American voices. As a 
result, the issues and needs of Asian 
Americans are projected onto Pacific 
Islander Americans, misrepresenting 
the actual struggles Pacific Islanders 
face. For example, according to 
research compiled by APM Research 
Lab, Pacific Islander Americans are 
facing COVID-19 infection rates 
nearly two times higher than Asian 
Americans.

When I arrived in Ann Arbor 

in January, I embarked on a quest 
to survive my second semester of 
college. Along my epic journey, I 
faced powerful foes such as Calculus 
2 and second year-level Japanese. 
Night after night, I crossed swords 
with Taylor polynomials and kanji 
characters. Despite several defeats 
over the course of the semester, I 
vanquished my last final exams and 
claimed the ultimate treasure, an 
ancient relic I had long since forgotten: 
free time. Immediately after my Calc 
2 final, I swiftly exited Gradescope 
and navigated over to Steam; it was 
time I enjoyed myself with a good 
video game after months of non-
stop work. Combing through my 
backlog of games, I stumbled across 
“Omori,” a psychological horror 
game set in a deceptively bright and 
colorful, nostalgic, 8-bit fantasy world 
brimming with amusing characters 
and heartfelt moments.

I bought Omori just a few days after 

its release after seeing a video showing 
the game’s cute art style on Tiktok. 
I had anticipated the game’s horror 

elements from its description on 
Steam; nevertheless I was still a little 
shocked when my player character 
began in a sparse, eerie white room 
called Whitespace. After poking 
around the area and obtaining a knife 
as a weapon, a door became accessible 
and let me venture through the 
world with other friendly characters 
I met. The pastel world design and 
charming characters were so adorable 
that I pretty much forgot that this was 
a horror game. And because I was 
familiar with the fairly simple combat 
system found in other turn-based 
role-playing games like “Pokémon,” 
I was immediately comfortable with 
Omori. As a result, I never wondered 
why there was an inaccessible menu 
option labelled “???” on the top-left 
corner of my screen (Since I was still 
in the tutorial, I figured this would 
be a normal tool that would open up 
to me later). And when my character 
learned a combat skill bluntly labelled 
“stab,” I never viewed it as anything 
more than a basic element typical to 
the genre. 

This 
comforting 
familiarity 

combined with Omori’s exaggeratedly 
adorable world design lulled me into a 
false sense of security and quietly set 
me up for calamity.

After I spent about 30 minutes 

learning 
the 
in-game 
combat 

mechanics, becoming acquainted 
with the main cast and marveling at 
the charming world and character 
design, 
one 
of 
the 
supporting 

characters 
suddenly 
became 

enveloped by a mysterious darkness. 
Completely unexplained, the player 
character is teleported back to 
Whitespace, except now the door 
I once passed through is gone. The 
sudden ejection from my pastoral 
fantasyland back into the sinister 
Whitespace left me trembling as I 
yearned for the sense of comfort I 
felt just minutes prior. With no clear 
way out in an infinite and empty 
room, I wandered around aimlessly, 
desperately searching for the exit but 
to no avail. Out of options, I opened up 
the in-game menu in order to search 
for an item or something to use. 

“STAB,” written in a bold red 

font, replaced the “???” option I 
had previously ignored. Once I 
apprehensively selected the “STAB” 
option, the game prompted me to 
confirm that I wanted to stab my 
player character. 

Disclaimer: 
This 
collective 

statement 
is 
written 
under 
the 

crucial understanding that Israel is 
an occupation and apartheid. It is an 
occupation in that it controls who goes 
in and out of Palestine and continuously 
and illegally occupies Palestinian land 
through Israeli police aggression and 
Israeli “Defense” Forces, which we 
will more accurately refer to as the 
Israeli Occupation Forces throughout 
this statement since “defense” falsely 
implies an equivalent power to defend 
against. Israel is an apartheid in that the 
Palestinian citizens of Israel are treated 
as less than by the Israeli government 
on issues from a lack of civil rights 
compared to Jewish citizens of Israel, to 
medical discrimination, to a lack of clean 
water, and property expulsions. Israel 
exists at the expense of Palestinians, 
and for that, this piece is centered on the 
importance of a liberated Palestine. 

Introduction
Saturday, May 15 marked the 

annual 
commemoration 
of 
the 

Nakba (Nakba is the Arabic word 
for “catastrophe”). Since 1948, the 
ongoing Nakba has resulted in the 
displacement of over 7.2 million 
Palestinians, the brutal genocide of 
over 1,240,000 Palestinians and the 
destruction of over 927 Palestinian 
villages. This day signifies yet 
another year of oppression and forced 
immobility for the Palestinian people 
as they continuously suffer from the 
structurally violent state of Israel 
that works to oppress, dispossess and 
displace Palestinians. The oppression 
of Palestinian people is commonly 
mislabeled as a “conflict” between 
two sides. This false characterization 
serves as an erasure of Palestinian 
oppression and suggests Palestine’s 
defense is equally oppressive. Israel 

has one of the most extensive armies 
in the world, while Palestine does 
not have a unified military and has 
restricted access to weaponry; it’s 
clear that “bothsidesism” and the 
notion of an equal conflict are not 
only inapplicable, but dangerous. 
The magnitude of Israeli settler-
colonialism, the development of the 
apartheid-state and the ongoing 
ethnic cleansing committed against 
Palestinians 
indicates 
that 
this 

oppression should more accurately 
be termed a humanitarian crisis. The 
oppression of Palestinians is rooted in 
Zionism: a racist, ultra-nationalistic 
ideology that, while based on the 
desire for Jewish self-determination, 
strips Palestinians of their rights 
on their own ancestral land and 
justifies the continuous perpetration 
of inhumane war crimes towards 
Palestinians. The bigotry and violence 
birthed from Zionism is the direct 
reason that Israel violently targeted 
Palestinians in the Al-Aqsa Mosque on 
May 7, killed over 197 Palestinians in 
Gaza with airstrikes in the last week, 
murdered at least seven people in the 
occupied West Bank and violently 
attempted to dispossess Palestinian 
families in Sheikh Jarrah. 

May 15 of 2021, Nakba Day, 

commemorates 73 years of pain for 
Palestinians, characterized by years 
of air strikes, innumerable violations 
of humanitarian laws — including the 
denial of basic rights for Palestinians 
such as the right to own property or 
vote — and relentless weaponization 
of international aid in support of 
Israel. Much of academia, from 
students to scholars, dismisses the 
oppression endured by Palestinians 
as complex, but in reality it is quite 
simple to understand — Israel is the 
oppressor and Palestinians are the 
oppressed.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com MICHIGAN IN COLOR

Every so often I hear about Hazaras 

in Afghanistan. I just did last week — 
it was mostly children who died. I 
remember how Khaled Hosseini so 
beautifully and eloquently painted a 
heartbreaking picture of the recent 
history of Afghanistan. and how 
To this, students in classes at my 
predominantly white high school 
analyzed questions such as “why 
did Hassan and Ammar get treated 
so differently?” “What was the basis 
of discrimination and subjection 
for Hassan and his family?” Every 
so often I hear about a blast in 
Pakistan, and every so often I meet 
a family friend whose uncle, cousin, 
or sibling was killed in these blasts. 
Just yesterday, I found out about the 
Gilgit massacre of Shias, initiated 
over a difference in Eid dates. I 
stared blankly at my laptop screen 
wide-eyed, shocked at the abhorrent 
events, and shocked that I just heard 
of it. I think about what makes me 
different to freely practice my Shiism 
here, until I wonder — what is free 

when yes, I openly use a sajdiga for 
my daily prayer, but still have to hear 
the the classic ‘why do you pray on a 
rock’ joke, still have to feign toleration 
at events with the overall community 
when I hear “we’re allowed to marry 
Jews and Muslims, just not Shias.” 
Every so often when I hear the 
news, I turn to the only method of 
denoting solidarity in this day and 
age — Instagram social activism. 
This metric is by no means indicative 
of genuity, but is telling enough in 
the sense that many Muslims will 
post about all social justice issues, 
until it comes to Shias. Ironically, 
these are the same Muslims who 
retweet “when it’s Muslims, the 
world is silent”, as though oppression 
is a competition in the first place. 
For me as a Shia and my best friend 
as an Ahmedi, there’s another layer 
to that silence- when it is us, even 
Muslims will be silent. The sense of 
solidarity that ever so often arises 
among Muslims is always amazing to 
see, but a part of me knows that this 
same unity will never be granted to 
Muslim minorities. 

It’s 6 a.m.: My mom has just woken 

up. I am sitting at the kitchen counter 
with a blanket around my shoulders, 
coffee cup in hand while lectures play 
on double-speed on my laptop. Finally 
convinced to go to sleep, I set my 
alarm in time for my 11 a.m. meeting 
with 
my 
internship 
supervisor, 

exasperated at the reality that this 
is what my life has become: zoom 
calls, sleepless nights, days in sweats, 
family arguments and isolation. 
Sighing, I scroll through my social 
media feeds, a nightly regimen, only 
to find photos of people on vacation, 
hanging out with friends, taking road 
trips… having fun. These photos fill 
me with anxiety — aren’t we still 
battling a global pandemic? Shouldn’t 
we be proceeding with caution? 
However, I also felt tinges of sadness 
and frustration because I am jealous 
— I wish I could have as much fun, but 
the pandemic wasn’t all to blame.

I am nearing my last semester at the 

University of Michigan and I cannot 
confidently say I have made many 
good friends here. I have two to three 
friends whom I speak to regularly, 

meaning at most once a month since 
the pandemic. Nevertheless, my 
struggle to foster friendships and 
have a “normal” college life did not 
only start in March 2020 but has 
been ongoing since the beginning 
of my freshman year. My time at the 
University so far can be best described 
as a tug-of-war: on one end were my 
parents, and I positioned myself at 
the opposite end and extended a rope 
between us. As I was the first member 
of my family to attend college in the 
United States, my parents and I found 
ourselves in territories we’ve never 
been in before: Who gets to make the 
decisions about my outings? When is 
my curfew? Who decides who comes 
into my room and who doesn’t? When 
my parents held and tightly pulled 
on the rope, it meant constraining 
the freedoms I found essential: 
studying in friends’ rooms, staying 
up late and attending events without 
permission. To them, I was neither 
an independent adult nor a needy 
child. I had the responsibilities of a 
college student but not the freedom 
of one, an in-between space that’s 
not one or the other. They tugged the 
rope according to those expectations 
and when I felt that pull, I yanked 
even harder the other way. I often 

lashed out in defiance of my parents, 
tightening my grasp on the rope 
and causing tension to build. But no 
matter how much we pushed and 
pulled, no matter how sore our hands 
became and exhausted we grew, we 
stayed in place and made no progress 
in either direction.

I 
started 
questioning 
ideas 

supposedly 
fundamental 
to 
my 

identity: Why should I adhere to 
these rules? What does it mean if I 
didn’t? How did these rules come 
to be? Is this something all Syrians 
followed? What about all Muslims? 
What does our faith say about this? As 
I came into my own, I felt the weight 
of these choices growing like rocks on 
my shoulder. Often, I shared thoughts 
or opinions that made my parents 
worry, especially when I didn’t share 
their views on some of the issues 
most important to them. Instead, my 
actions and ideas were sometimes 
labeled as wrong and harmful from 
approaches to social justice to even my 
ideal career path. Additionally, due to 
the intersectionality of my identities 
— Syrian, Ismaili Muslim, immigrant 
woman — there was no community on 
campus that I closely identified with. 
I became a foreigner in both Syrian 
and American spaces, not enough 

of either to completely fit in. Most of 
my peers had a very different outlook 
at things: College was a monumental 
moment in our lives where we learn 
to be independent and find ourselves 
and dream about our futures. While I 
did identify with their sentiments and 
the idea of a transition, it was difficult 
for me to adopt that perspective. I 
could not be American enough for my 
peers’ advice and I could not be Syrian 
enough for my parents’ expectations. 
Even other Syrian Americans I 
knew had college experiences on 
the complete opposite side of the 
spectrum.

During the winter semester of 

my junior year, I decided to take a 
semester off because it all became too 
much to deal with while also being 
a student. It was unthinkable to my 
parents that I spend this semester 
anywhere but home, especially Ann 
Arbor — a place that to them, was 
full of bad influences. Staying home 
presented its own challenges. Two 
months into that semester, COVID-
19 hit and arguments erupted almost 
every day regarding questions of 
where I would be living for the hybrid 
academic year. Even as I grew and my 
empathy for my parents grew, it also 
had limits: I still could not fathom 

why they would not let me be on 
campus. Now, instead of being home 
for four months, I have been home for 
a year and five months. This period 
has only advanced my isolation 
and further distanced me and my 
friends. My social life was replaced by 
occasional facetime calls and once-a-
month day trips I would take to Ann 
Arbor for visits.

As I reflect on these past months, I 

realize I may have acted out of a lack 
of empathy — fixating on my own 
negativity rather than considering 
how my family was feeling too. I 
dismissed large compromises and 
efforts that my family had made for 
assimilating into “the American life,” 
like allowing me to go to my first 
sleepover or inviting my friends over 
for a surprise birthday party. I focused 
too much on our disagreement and 
overlooked the tremendous amount 
of love we shared that allowed my 
parents to sacrifice so much for us 
with big smiles on their faces always. 
While I positioned myself and my 
parents on opposite sides of the rope 
in this game of tug-of-war, I realized 
tugging was not a way to freedom, but 
letting go was.

After a dormant three years, English 

singer-songwriter FKA Twigs has 
given me the first song of my playlist 
titled, “Banshee Vibes: I wanna rip my 
heart out and scream, but in a good 
way.” Her hit single “Cellophane,” an 
extremely vulnerable piano ballad 
centers around leading a relationship 
in the public eye and the toll it takes 
on one’s self-esteem and image. With 
a Grammy Award nomination for Best 
Music Video and named the best song 
of 2019 by Pitchfork, “Cellophane” 
unravels the raw human emotions 
that envelop love, loss, and everything 
in between. Twigs’ delicate and 
soothing voice offers a stark contrast 
to the song’s heart wrenching lyrics; 
uncomplicated words dripping with 
complicated feelings, pushing and 
pulling at all of our hearts.

FKA Twigs opens “Cellophane” 

with a series of emotional questions 
seemingly directed at her former 
lover, Twilight star, Robert Pattinson. 
It seizes our heartbroken souls from 
the start, ensuring Twigs is getting 

her point across without drawing it 
out while also engaging the slightly 
psychotic—like me—who listen to sad 
songs, especially at the height of their 
joy. Littered with rhetorical questions, 
accompanied only by the majestic keys 
of a piano playing in D Major paints 
Twigs in an anguished state, begging 
the question “Why was I not enough 
to be worthy of your love?” She goes on 
to repeat the chorus twice more in the 
middle of the song, pinpointing this 
message of worthiness in the face of 
adversity without explicitly stating it. 
Talk about self-esteem issues, sheesh.

Throughout the remainder of the 

song, Twigs uses very powerful, yet 
simple diction. Using repetitive verses 
like, 

“They wanna see us, wanna see us 

alone

They wanna see us, wanna see us 

apart,”

She’s able to highlight the pain and 

vulnerability that accompanies the 
meddling and scrutiny of the world’s 
selfish eyes. During her three year 
relationship with Robert Pattinson, 
she received constant criticism and 
hate from Twilight fans who were 
upset that Pattison was no longer 

dating his white co-star, Kristen 
Stewart. I don’t know about y’all, but 
anything is still a better love story 
than Twilight, especially the beautiful 
Twattinson couple…actually, Pigs is 
probably our best bet.The criticism 
turned into racism, and fans all over 
the globe began targeting Twigs’ 
biracial 
background, 
comparing 

her to a monkey regardless of what 
she did. She also spoke on how this 
constant racist barrage made her 
feel dysmorphic for close to a year 
especially when she saw photos of 
herself.

Her seemingly effortless word 

choice and repetition gives the illusion 
of simplicity whilst her groaning, 
cracking voice bears the weight of 
the world and all its problems. The 
contrast between the delicate piano 
playing, while her vulnerable vocals 
shine through allows us to relate to 
her relationship problems, even if 
not at the same level as that of A-list 
celebrities. Twigs’ word choice, while 
reveling in the phrase “short, but 
sweet,” is extremely impactful and 
never overstays its welcome.

It feels like the name Squid 

has been circulating around the 
music blogosphere for half a 
decade at this point. The band has 
maintained an almost elusive aura, 
only sparking further intrigue 
with every subsequent single and 
EP released. What’s more, the 
music they were trickling out to 
the public evaded any surefire 
categorization, to a point where 
critics and enthusiasts alike have 
piled them with other oddball 
U.K. groups as something they 
call “New Weird Britain” — 
which is just a fancy way of saying 
“unclassifiable guitar music from 
across the pond.” Although, if 
we’re to take this niche seriously, 
the associated bands are certainly 
making a statement this year with 
shame and Black Country, New 
Road already releasing critically 
hailed projects. However, if there 
is any record that people were 
expecting from this supposed 
subgenre, it is Squid’s debut. 

Bright Green Field follows 

the pattern of the music Squid 
has been teasing up until now, 

which is that it doesn’t really 
follow any pattern at all. Without 
a doubt, there will be people 
who simply call it art rock and 
move on, but that would be a 
strong generalization of what 
the band manages to construct. 
Bright Green Field is an album 
so dedicated to the concept of 
“no idea is a bad idea” that it 

fully commits itself to throw 
everything at the wall. Naturally, 
this is quite a risky endeavor, and 
for the less prepared, this surely 
would have been an unmitigated 

mess. Fortunately, it would seem 
the last five years have properly 
conditioned Squid. Bright Green 
Field 
successfully 
avoids 
the 

pitfalls of such a process and 
amounts to one of the most 
unique rock albums this year, and 
on their first go no less.

Of course, Squid’s inspirations 

come through clearly — Talking 

Heads and Pere Ubu are two 
that come to mind — but it’s the 
instability of how these influences 
are combined and transfigured 
that demonstrates the group’s 

originality. 
For 
example, 
the 

track “Boy Racers” starts with a 
groove and adds layers of guitar 
riffs into something both upbeat 
and off-kilter. Much like some of 
the other lengthy tracks on the 
album, it builds pace and alters 
itself several times, but then gives 
out abruptly halfway through 
into something that can only be 
described as if Throbbing Gristle 
decided to take up vaporwave. 
It’s unbelievably bold, totally 
irrational and expertly executed. 
Another track that follows this 
mold is “2010,” with its complex 
guitar 
patterns 
— 
sounding 

straight out of In Rainbows-era 
Radiohead — that switch to all-
out thrash metal on a dime. It’s 
one of the best songs on the album, 
acting as a perfect centerpiece to 
the chaos.

Lyrically 
speaking, 
Squid 

likes to keep things compact and 
esoteric. It’s a bit of a nebulous 
effort to try and decipher some 
larger 
connected 
meaning. 

However, an overarching theme 
of 
corporate 
mundanity 
and 

its stale purposelessness does 
pop up across the album. The 
track “Narrator” describes the 
desire to dictate one’s direction 

in society, with vocalist Oliver 
Judge chanting out to the world 
“I’ll play my part” as if expecting 
some universal reply. The song 
“G.S.K.” is a direct reference to 
the 
pharmaceutical 
company 

GlaxoSmithKline and goes on to 
create devastating imagery about 
a “Concrete Island.” This strange 
duality between the bombastic 
fun of the music and the crushing 
core of the lyrics contributes a 
certain mood to the album as 
if someone took a happy face 
and stapled the smile in place. 
Perhaps the Bright Green Field 
they are referring to is actually 
astroturf.

When 
it 
was 
announced 

that 
Squid 
was 
signing 
to 

legendary electronic label Warp, 
it only added to the immense 
anticipation that the band had 
already accrued. Warp has built 
a reputation for signing non-
electronic groups just as they 
make their big breakout into the 
musical landscape; they did it 
for Grizzly Bear, Danny Brown, 
Battles, 
Stereolab, 
Broadcast, 

Yves Tumor and countless others. 
With Bright Green Field, Squid is 
staking their claim as a member 
of this list.

The anomaly of “17776: What football will look like in the future” 

Our time will come to an end. But 

what if it doesn’t? What would you do? 
Would you quit your job and travel the 
world? Take a nap? “17776,” a hypertext 
speculative fiction narrative by Jon 
Bois, proposes a different answer on 
behalf of humanity: play football. As 
a deeply conditional football “fan,” 
this piece has to be my favorite thing 
I’ve ever read (and truly, I believe that 
“17776” should be experienced with 
little prior knowledge).

Published online in 2017 at SB 

Nation, a sports-focused media outlet 
owned by Vox, “17776” is a deeply odd 
and oddly deep fictional narrative 
that questions how the scarcity of 
time affects existence. Set 15,755 
years in the future, Bois creates a 
world where birth, death and the 
suffering in between ended on April 7, 
2026. People live free of financial and 
health concerns; instead, in the United 
States, many focus their energy on an 
ongoing nationwide football game, 

where participants play or engage 
in fanfare. The story is narrated by 
three sentient space probes, who 
jokingly converse about the state of the 
universe while observing the game.

It’s unlike anything I’ve ever 

read. First, the format: a mixture 
of monthly calendars, group chat 
records, 
historical 
documents, 

podcast transcripts and Google Maps 
of a landscape different from our own. 
“17776” is a narrative that pushes 
the boundaries of fiction, especially 
on the internet: it’s one of the most 
well-known additions to the internet 
genre of hyperliterature, in which 
online fiction uses unconventional, 
expressive forms to convey its 
“function.”

While 
newly-awakened 
space 

probe Nine’s (Pioneer 9) group chat 
messages are formal, insistent and 
laden with question marks (most 
commonly “What?” followed by 
questions like “We don’t do anything, 
right?” and “This is the end, right? The 
end of this story?”), Ten’s (Pioneer 
10) and Juice’s (Jupiter Icy Moons 
Explorer) texts are much more casual, 

with less grammar and more jokes, 
like this one about Lunchables: “neatly 
partitioned meats and cheeses appeal 
to me on an aesthetic level ok mfer.” 
Ten and Juice are deeply familiar with 
the state of the universe and have no 
sense of time or urgency — they don’t 
ask questions or bother with most 
things, really. Compared with Nine’s 
insistent questioning and existential 
dread, they seem uninterested in 
“serious” questions of the world 
around them. Juice would much 
rather discuss football, like many of 
the humans on earth.

The lack of “productivity” infuriates 

Nine, from the late 20th century, who 
begins angrily texting messages such 
as “I’m appalled… disgusted, I guess,” 
overcome with the lack of “purpose.” 
Ten and Juice then slowly and calmly 
text back, explaining to Nine that 
“wasting” time is simply impossible — 
time has ceased to be a finite resource, 
and life goes on forever. In “17776,” 
human beings are no longer under the 
jurisdiction of the natural world. But 
for creatures who’ve learned to define 
their existence with constraints such 

as time, money and physical ability, 
immortality 
is 
terrifying. 
Since, 

instead of uncertainty or stress, 
“boredom is their only enemy,” so 
humanity turns to sports to deal with 
being alive.

The sheer amount of thought put 

into “17776” is impressive. With plenty 
of newspaper clippings, historical facts 
and believable vignettes, the intricate 
worldbuilding makes the piece feel 
like an irreverent, entertaining study 
of history. Looking at historical 
documents such as certificates and 
newspaper clippings makes me feel 
like I’m trying to answer a Data-Based 
Question for my high school American 
history class again (in a good way, this 
time). The montages of documents 
over a course of 15,000 years have 
a way of making you feel incredibly 
inconsequential in their magnitude. 
Most of the “historical” vignettes 
narrated by the space probes’ group 
chat gave me genuine goosebumps, 
as I absorbed the stories in which 
people grapple with the pain of an 
endless existence. The tales weave in 
and out of the football game, making 

the 
unnatural 
seem 
profoundly 

mundane, and the every day seem 
truly otherworldly — an always-
burning light bulb is sacred, and New 
York City has all but disappeared into 
an underwater ghost town.

Additionally, “17776” remains the 

only true “utopian” piece of literature 
I’ve ever read; absent of suffering, 
it’s impressive that the piece so 
thoroughly captures attention without 
the traditional ideas of “conflict.” 
Instead, it draws readers in through 
thorough worldbuilding, crafting a 
reality wholly different but strangely 
similar to our own. Ultimately, within 
the story, many Americans turn to 
football to pass the time, like we 
always have. Many, including Nine, 
could easily call playing football a 
waste of time. But, in our world and 
theirs, humans’ need for sports goes 
beyond expectations of productivity 
and profit; Bois shows us that to unite 
in this fashion and bring uncertainty 
and excitement to a life filled with 
mundanity is anything but useless.

Hundreds march in Dearborn in support of Palestinians

A few thousand Detroit and 

Dearborn residents gathered to 
rally against Israeli airstrikes 
and evictions of Palestinians 
Saturday afternoon. Organized 
by 
the 
Palestinian 
Youth 

Movement 
and 
endorsed 
by 

the Party for Socialism and 
Liberation – Detroit, protesters 
of all ages marched through the 
streets of Dearborn with chants 
of “Free Palestine!” and “From 
the river to the sea, Palestine will 
be free!”

Demonstrators 
waved 

Palestinian flags of all sizes, 
along with many signs with the 
hashtag “#SaveSheikJarrah.” The 
group expressed vocal outrage at 
what they perceived as support 
for Israel and inaction on behalf 
of the Biden administration.

Beginning 
at 
the 
Arab 

American National Museum, the 
crowd listened to speeches from 
various organizers and activists 
calling for the end to American 
military investment in Israel, 
through 
a 
movement 
known 

as 
Boycott, 
Divestment 
and 

Sanctions (BDS).

The group marched, biked, and 

drove down Michigan Avenue, 
with many bystanders showing 
their support as they passed by, 
sometimes waving flags of their 
own. When the protest entered 
the 
neighborhood 
streets 
of 

Dearborn, some residents stood 
on 
their 
porches 
expressing 

support, and others even joined 
the march. 

The 
protesters 
blocked 

westbound 
traffic, 
marching 

down the M-153 highway, and 
the group halted under a bridge, 
where organizers hung flags 

from the overpass.

Ultimately, the group gathered 

outside 
the 
Dearborn 
Police 

Department, where organizers 
voiced their support for the Black 
Lives Matter movement, drawing 
connections 
between 
Black 

Americans’ 
struggle 
against 

systemic racism and the push for 
Palestinian liberation.

As the protesters left the 

Dearborn 
Police 
Department, 

some planted small Palestinian 
flags in the grass with the names 
of Black people killed by police 
written on them, including those 
of George Floyd and Breonna 
Taylor.

Once the group returned to 

the Arab American National 
Museum, organizers gave a few 
final speeches and ended with 
a call to action to come out to 
protest Joe Biden’s upcoming 
visit to the Ford Rouge Electric 
Vehicle Center on Tuesday, May 
18.

The Show Must Go On

The Michigan Theater and State 

Theatre, located in downtown Ann 
Arbor, have been home to countless 
movie screenings and performing arts 
events for the Ann Arbor and U-M 
communities in their respective 93 and 
79 years of operation. The pair of historic 
theaters, operated by the Michigan 
Theater Foundation, have faced a year 
rife with challenges brought on by the 
COVID-19 pandemic.

In early March 2020, as COVID-

19 began to take hold in the state, the 
Michigan and State theaters closed their 

doors as per an executive order signed by 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The closure was 
intended to last for two weeks, but as the 
pandemic worsened, the theaters stayed 
closed indefinitely, with the marquees 
displaying reassuring messages such as 
“Flatten the Curve, See You Soon,” “Good 
Health to All,” and “Thank You Frontline 
Heros.”

Through the pause, the theaters 

offered virtual screenings, custom 
marquee messages, and concessions 
to-go. 
Nevertheless, 
the 
theaters 

averaged a weekly loss of $10,000, and as 
of September, the theaters had suffered a 
total loss of more than $1.3 million. 

One of the theaters’ primary sources of 

support during the pandemic came from 
local community members, who rallied 
together to contribute via memberships, 
donations and sponsorships. Although 
the theaters were able to reopen in 
October 2020, they quickly had to close 
back down due to a statewide order in 
November.

In late January 2021, the theaters 

were able to reopen for limited in-person 
screenings. The Michigan Theater 
symbolically reopened with the film “A 
Hero for a Night,” which played at the 
original opening of the theater in 1928. 

I visited the theaters in April during a 

sparsely attended matinee screening. As 
masked patrons entered, they were faced 

with temperature checks, hand sanitizer, 
distancing markers, and plexiglass 
barriers. 

Inside the theaters, there was room 

for distancing, as the ticketing system 
guarantees at least six feet of space for 
each patron and attendance is capped at 
50 percent. The concession stands were 
notably empty and the water and soda 
fountains closed, in part because masks 
are required in the theaters. 

When the film started, employees 

wiped down surfaces in the lobby, and 
tended to tasks, such as changing poster 
displays and the text on the marquee.

Although the movie-going experience 

was significantly different, patrons said 

they were excited to get back out into 
the community and begin a return to 
normalcy.

In a January interview with MLive, 

Russ Collins, CEO and executive director 
of the Michigan Theater Foundation, 
remained optimistic about the theaters’ 
futures, while acknowledging it may 
take time for some to be comfortable 
attending in-person screenings.

“The reason that television and 

subsequently streaming and DVDs and 
all of those kind of things didn’t put an 
end to going out (to) the movies is not 
because you can watch something at 
home,” Collins said. “It’s about going out. 
There definitely is a future.”

What Macomb County can teach us about American politics

B

ack when blue and red were 
just Crayola colors to me, I 
remember sitting around the 

reading carpet at my elementary 
school in Macomb County, Michigan, 
as everyone went around and talked 
about what their parents did for a 
living. Almost everyone seemed to 
have at least one parent who worked 
for a car company. With my dad 
working at Chrysler for nearly three 
decades, I was proud to be a part of 
something.

Although I moved away from 

Macomb County years ago, I lived 
at the Oakland-Macomb border and 
had strong ties with friends and 
family in my former area that gave 
me reasons to be there frequently. 
Up until high school, Macomb was 
not much more than a place I called 
home — full of memories in places 
that I knew almost innately, like 
recognizing my own reflection 
in the mirror. But as I grew past 
elementary and middle school, I 
started to follow political trends. 

Around the same time, I started 
talking to my dad more about his 
time working at Chrysler.

I stayed up late last year following 

the 2020 elections, hearing national 
news networks talk about Macomb 
as a representation of the country’s 
blue-collar workers in the 2016 
election — typical blue voters who 
turned red for the last election. 
I heard phrases like “growing 
disgruntled” and “feeling neglected” 
by both parties. 

Having grown up in Macomb, I 

was surprised to hear this. I felt 
that I had grown up in a relatively 
diverse area, at least from all 
perspectives that I was aware of as 
a second-grader. Although I knew 
my dad had his stresses about work, 
it didn’t seem to be any more than 
any other work stresses I had seen 
in TV shows and movies. Nor did 
my neighbors seem as if they were 
disgruntled; but then again, 8-year-
old me wasn’t talking about politics 
with my playmates’ parents. I was 

curious how far the generalized 
disillusionment spread.

But this sentiment dates back to 

before 2020, even before 2016. Stanley 
Greenberg’s 1995 book “Middle Class 
Dreams” called Macomb “the site 
of real drama in our political life” 
because of its battleground status. 
Between what the media was telling 
me and what I knew from my family’s 
personal experiences, I wanted to 
dig deeper and see what was really 
happening in Macomb.

Has the media exaggerated the 

claims of political shifts in Macomb 
County, or has the dominant ideology 
really shifted significantly over 
the years? Has the area become a 
political microcosm of working-class 
America?

* * *

My 
mom 
recently 
sent 
me 

an article: “White angst keeps 
Trumpism alive in Macomb County”. 
This echoed the sentiments of the 
national media headlines I had seen 
before, but I wondered how recently 

this “angst” started. The way I had 
perceived Macomb County from 
general media, I was expecting a 
large shift for the Republicans in 2016 
and 2020 compared to a history of 
Democratic voting before that.

When I looked at election results, 

I was surprised to find smaller 
margins than I expected.

Trump had won with 53.6% of 

the Macomb vote in 2016, whereas 
Clinton had 42.1% of the vote. 
However, there were still more 
Democratic straight-party voters 
— voters who chose all candidates 
of one party on their ballot — than 
Republican that year. The gap 
slightly closed in 2020, with 53.4% 
of the vote going to Trump and 
45.3% going to Biden, but more 
Republicans than Democrats voted 
straight party this time.

I also looked back at voting data 

and was surprised to see Republican 
nominee Bush holding the majority 
as recent as 2004, with his father 
holding it in 1992. From media 

portrayal, I had expected Macomb to 
elect the Democrat candidate every 
time except Reagan and Trump. 
With this in the back of my mind, and 
knowing the importance of the auto 
industry to Macomb’s economy, I set 
out to talk to Macomb auto workers 
about what politics look like on the 
plant floor. 

* * *

Kevin McWilliams is a team leader 

at the Chrysler plant in Macomb, 
where he has worked since 2010. 
Prior to that, he had worked at 
Chrysler plants outside of Michigan 
since 1995.

As a member of the United 

Auto Workers (UAW) — one of the 
largest unions in North America, 
representing workers in a variety of 
economic sectors — McWilliams felt 
his and his coworkers’ voting was 
occasionally influenced by who the 
UAW endorses.

The j word: journalism at Michigan

T

he debate of the college 
major is an endless uphill 
battle; you can ponder and 

argue and make all the decisions you 
want without ever truly knowing if 
you’re making the right choice. It is 
impossible for a major to guarantee 
personal success, yet choosing one can 
feel like closing yourself off to only a 
select few career paths. The majors 
that are most valued by academic 
institutions constantly change as 
society shifts its priorities and goals.

If I had known what I wanted to 

do before entering college, there is a 
good chance I would not have ended 
up at the University of Michigan. I 
have always been a writer and wanted 
to pursue that in some form, but my 
work with The Daily opened up my 
love for journalism. Since realizing 
what I wanted to pursue, I have 
buried myself in deciding what major 
and classes are the “next best thing.” 
History, communications, sociology 
and psychology are only a few of the 
phases I’ve gone through just in this 
past semester. The University’s lack 
of a journalism major has made me 
wonder whether or not I necessarily 
need to major in it at all. 

For 
students 
interested 
in 

journalism like myself, the debate of 
practicality versus academic value 
for undergraduate majors becomes 

even more concentrated. A major 
in journalism can offer plenty of 
benefits: direct writing and reporting 
training, a specialized curriculum 
and access to professors who have had 
work experience in the news sphere. 
However, a journalism degree could 
be too specific and prevent students 
from experiencing a more theoretical, 
well-rounded education. 

In a report from the Knight 

Foundation, a non-profit committed 
to keeping journalism alive through 
investment and grants, Carnegie 
Corporation 
President 
Vartan 

Gregorian puts it bluntly: 

“Journalism schools are teaching 

journalistic techniques rather than 
subject matter. Journalists should 
be cultured people who know about 
history, economics, science. Instead 
they are learning what is called nuts 
and bolts. Like schools of education, 
journalism schools should either be 
reintegrated intellectually into the 
university or they should be abolished.”

Here at the University, they have 

chosen the latter. After a complicated, 
century-long revamping of what is now 
the Department of Communication 
and Media, the original journalism 
program at the University was 
eradicated. Although it’s unclear why 
this choice was made, many opponents 
of the decision saw it as an elitist way 

of weeding out students interested in a 
vocational education. 

Professor Derek Vaillant, who is 

also associate chair of undergraduate 
studies within the Communications 
and Media department, explained 
the combination of numerous extinct 
programs 
(Journalism, 
Speech, 

Theater, Cultural Studies, etc.) into the 
department we know today. 

The committee that chose to 

shut down the journalism program, 
Vaillant says, was charged by many 
faculty and students for being elitist 
and condescending. Many argued that 
the University’s journalism program 
“lacked national impact.” 

“(Saying ‘lacked national impact’) is 

a sort of a way of saying: it’s not very 
prestigious, it’s not very good,” Vaillant 
said. “Was it not very good for training 
professional journalists? I’m not sure. 
Was it not very good in the way that 
it seemed kind of vocational and like 
something that state schools do to pay 
the bills? Maybe that’s closer to the 
truth.”

In an attempt to stay true to 

being the “leaders and best,” the 
University 
removed 
a 
program 

with consistent student and faculty 
interest. Prioritizing the liberal arts 
and academic thought over vocational 
training is a staple in America’s most 
selective universities, such as those in 

the Ivy League. Other highly ranked 
public schools such as the University of 
California, Los Angeles, University of 
California, Berkeley and the University 
of Virginia also utilize this liberal 
arts approach. By abolishing our 
journalism program, the University 
is seemingly leaning into the identity 
of an elite institution rather than the 
large public university that it is.

Beyond the fact that few journalism 

courses exist here to begin with, many 
of them reside under aliases such 
as “immersion writing,” “creative 
nonfiction” and “public writing.” 
The word “journalism” has become 
somewhat of a four-letter word to 
academics who prioritize abstract 
ideas over practical skill training. We 
hear very little of what Peabody award 
winner and visiting professor in the 
Department of Communication and 
Media, Robert Yoon, refers to as the “J 
word” within U-M academics. 

Undergraduate journalism degrees, 

with a few possible exceptions 
from top-tier universities such as 
Northwestern University and the 
University of Southern California, 
seem to be associated with lucrative job 
training rather than academic thought. 
By diluting these journalism courses 
into the English and Communication 
and 
Media 
departments, 
the 

University strives to associate itself 
with top-tier academia rather than 
career preparation. 

“Especially if you look at the English 

department, there are all these kinds 
of creative writing programs and (the 
euphemism “long form reporting”) 
is one of the genres,” Vaillant said. “I 
think (the English department) has 
incorporated some of this form of 
education, but it’s done very carefully 
because they don’t want a perception 
of overemphasizing vocation at the 
expense of this more idealized life 
of the mind, humanities sort of ideal, 
which is the ideal of the modern 
university.”

Although 
I 
understand 
the 

University’s desire to remain a place 
of higher learning rather than of 
vocational training, this sentiment 
represents faculties’ disregard for 
students’ interests. The decision to 
eradicate the journalism program 
was made by faculty even though 
hundreds of students continue to 
be involved in student publications. 
Instead of focusing on teaching what 
students are most passionate about, 
this decision seems to have been made 
in order to ensure that every U-M 
program was deemed better than the 
rest.

Michigan to travel to 

Seattle for NCAA regional

Beaubien’s perfect game highlights 

doubleheader sweep

The D-1 Softball Committee 

revealed on Sunday that the 
Michigan softball team will travel 
to Seattle in the NCAA regional. 

The 
Seattle 
regional 
is 
a 

double-elimination 
bracket 

consisting of the home team in 
No. 16 Washington, Michigan, 
Western 
Athletic 
Conference 

champion Seattle, and Big Sky 

Conference champion Portland 
State. Michigan will face Seattle 
to open its regional battle on 
Friday night. 

Although 
Washington 
was 

ranked 16th by the committee, 
securing 
the 
final 
regional 

host site of the tournament, its 
resume suggests that they are a 
far-stronger team than that. The 
Huskies were ranked No. 5 in the 
nation entering the final weekend 
of the season. They went 41-11, 
and will pose a serious challenge 
for the Wolverines. 

Due to Seattle being the 16th 

and final regional host in the 
tournament, 
Michigan 
will 

most likely be forced to travel to 
Norman, Okla. to face the No.1 
Oklahoma softball team, should 
it survive the difficult Seattle 
regional. 

The selection comes after a 

strong season for the Wolverines. 
They partook in a conference-only 
schedule in the Big Ten, posting a 
36-6 record, and winning its 22nd 
conference title. The Wolverines’ 
resume is highlighted by key 
series wins against Northwestern 
and No. 23 Minnesota, the two 
other teams representing the Big 
Ten in the NCAA tournament. 

Michigan enters the NCAA 

tournament hot, winning 15 of its 
last 16 games. Matching up with 
Washington on its home field, 
however, will most likely be the 
team’s most difficult test of the 
season. 

In a meeting with reporters 

following the selection, Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins voiced her 
displeasure in the committee’s 
decision to send the Wolverines 
to Seattle, in a regional housing 
a top five team in the nation, as 

opposed to hosting the regional 
at Alumni field after her team 
produced a successful season in 
the Big Ten.

“(The committee) absolutely 

did not do a very good job,” 
Hutchins said. “They disrespected 
our entire conference … I’m not 
very pleased with (them) at all.” 

Last season’s NCAA softball 

tournament was canceled due 
to 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic. 

In the last installment of the 
tournament in 2019, Michigan 
hosted a regional in Ann Arbor, 
where they fell to James Madison 
University. 

Michigan has reached the 

NCAA 
tournament 
in 
every 

season since 1995. In that span, 
it has advanced to the super 
regionals 18 times, and continued 
to the College World Series 
12 times. It won the national 
championship in 2005. 

The Wolverines have failed 

to advance to a super regional in 
their past three attempts, marking 
the longest such stretch since 
their NCAA tournament streak 
began in 1995. They will look to 
end their dry spell this weekend, 
with 
regionals 
beginning 
on 

Friday. 

Rutgers pinch hitter Megan Herka 

walked to the plate ready to play 
spoiler. 

No. 18 Michigan had denied the 

Scarlet Knights a spot on base all 
game. Now, marking the potential 
last batter of the day, it was Herka’s 
job to ruin senior left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien’s perfect slate.

It looked like Herka was going to 

do just that, as she took three straight 
balls to start her plate appearance. 
The game wasn’t on the line, but a 
career milestone was. Facing a tough 
count, Beaubien kept her composure.

“If I threw another ball, I was 

gonna walk her anyway,” Beaubien 
said. “So I’m just staying loose and 
telling myself that if I stay loose and I 
throw this pitch, then it’s going to be a 
good one and trusting that they’re not 
going to hit it.”

Feeding Herka a strike and forcing 

a foul tip, Beaubien worked Herka 
back into the corner the Scarlet 
Knights had been stuck in all game. 
The final pitch careened toward 
junior catcher Hannah Carson and 
nestled itself in the well-worn leather 
of her glove.

Ball game.
Perfect game.
As Beaubien leapt into the air to 

celebrate an achievement that most 
pitchers can only dream of, Michigan 

celebrated an 11-0 win that could only 
be described as dominant in every 
measurable way.

A key part of that was the 

Wolverines’ defense. Out of 15 
batters, 13 were put out by the field. 
As much as the perfect game is an 
accomplishment for Beaubien, it also 
speaks to Michigan’s ability to back 
up its pitchers.

“I give a lot of credit to the defense 

today,” Beaubien said. “I didn’t have 
a lot of strikeouts, but the defense is 
making some great plays so I think 
that was a really big team effort and 
proud of my outfielders and I think 
everyone did a great job.”

Part of that team effort came from 

freshman catcher Keke Tholl, who 
made a spectacular catch on a foul ball 
in the fourth inning. First baseman 
Gabrielle Callaway tipped the ball in 
the air toward the first base line. Tholl 
popped out of her stance and chased 
it, diving forward to make the play.

The outcome suggests Rutgers’ 

at-bats were lackluster all game, but 
hitters were able to put the ball in 
play, sometimes deep. Every time that 
happened, though, they couldn’t find 
the gap and the Wolverines made an 
out.

No matter what the fielders could 

do to help her, the perfect game 
came down to superb pitching from 
Beaubien. 
The 
Scarlet 
Knights 

couldn’t get comfortable at the plate, 
and the edge that she had gained in 
Friday’s win meant she was attacking 

everyone that stepped in the batter’s 
box. Rutgers was forced to deal with 
poor pitches that left them empty 
handed.

Often, those led to quick, easy outs. 

Beaubien’s two strikeouts over the 
five innings is an uncharacteristically 
low count considering she averages 
around 9.88 strikeouts per seven 
innings. She didn’t need to get many, 
though, because the Scarlet Knights 
did the work for her.

In fact, the biggest challenge for 

Beaubien to overcome may have 
been keeping focused on the game 
itself rather than the upcoming 
milestone. That meant returning to 
the methodology that has guided the 
Wolverines all season.

“I was just trying to focus on one 

pitch at a time,” Beaubien said. “I 
didn’t want to get too excited about 
that possibility. The second you get 
too excited and start thinking about 
that, that’s when you’re most likely 
gonna give it up.”

Beaubien’s perfect outing was 

a fitting way to end what could be 
the last home start of her career. As 
the NCAA Tournament looms and 
Michigan focuses on winning its 
upcoming regional, this game proved 
that Beaubien’s not done yet. 

“I tell you, there’s some things I 

want from Megan Beaubien that are 
bigger than that,” Michigan coach 
Carol Hutchins said. “I want her to 
play on the biggest stage. And I want 
her to help take us there.”

Redshirt sophomore left-hander 

Steven Hajjar and sophomore right-
hander 
Cameron 
Weston 
have 

provided Michigan with a formidable 
1-2 punch at the top of its rotation. 
Hajjar sports a 4-0 record with an 
impressive 3.02 ERA while Weston, 
the number two starter, has posted a 
5-3 record and has an excellent 2.85 
ERA. After those two, however, the 
Wolverines continue to search for 
consistency. 

On Sunday, sophomore left-hander 

Jacob Denner showcased himself as a 
pitching option.

Denner has had a good 2021 

campaign as the team’s third starting 
pitcher. He has shown flashes of 
brilliance, but there is still room 
for improvement. As the schedule 
winds down, each game increases in 
importance and in perhaps the biggest 
game of the year, Denner was lights 
out.

On Sunday afternoon, Michigan met 

No. 21 Indiana in the rubber match of its 
three-game series. Considering their 
proximity atop the Big Ten standings, 
it had the feeling of a postseason tilt. In 
one of the most important games of the 

season, Michigan coach Erik Bakich 
needed a big outing from his third 
starting pitcher.

“Coach Bakich does a great job of 

shrinking the moment,” Denner said. 
“Just taking it one game at a time, one 
inning at a time, one pitch at a time. 
That’s really the mindset he’s put into 
us, win every pitch and good things 
will happen.”

The New Jersey product had 

arguably his best, and most clutch, 
game of the season versus the 
Hoosiers. He went six and one-third 
innings, gave up four hits, one walk, 
and six strikeouts. From the get-go, he 
was in control of the strike zone. He 
overpowered Indiana with his fastball 
and his changeup had good movement. 
He dictated the pace of the afternoon 
and allowed the offense to operate on 
their own terms.

Denner’s lone mistake came in the 

top of the fifth. Hoosiers’ outfielder 
Morgan Colopy lined a ball into right 
field that carried over the wall. Despite 
the slip up, Denner remained poised. 
He went through the rest of the inning 
with ease and propelled the Wolverines 
into the seventh with a two-run lead. 
With the win, Denner improves to 4-3 
on the year and his ERA is nearing the 
4.00 mark. 

“He attacked with three pitches,” 

Bakich said. “That’s a tough lineup to 
navigate, they’re very good players. To 
only give up a solo home run and get us 
into the seventh inning was huge.”

During game two on Saturday, the 

Wolverines’ bullpen was decimated 
by Indiana. They allowed nine runs 
during the seventh and eighth innings. 
More importantly, however, was that 
Michigan had an opportunity to pull 

off the comeback before the bullpen 
collapsed. Sunday afternoon, they 
redeemed themselves.

Big hits power Michigan over Indiana, 6-1

Sophomore infielder Ted Burton 

stepped into the batters’ box at the 
bottom of the second with the full 
intention of hitting the ball. After an 
embarrassing loss to Indiana the day 
before, Burton knew giving his team 
a chance to score could make the 
difference in the game.

After a 0-1 count, Burton lined the 

ball through left field for a single, 
giving life to the Wolverines’ offense 
and setting the tone for the entire 
game. Burton went on to hit three-of-
four on the day, boosting Michigan 
for a win over the Hoosiers 6-1. 

The Michigan baseball team (25-

13 Big Ten) played No. 21 Indiana (24-
12 Big Ten) on Sunday for the final 
game of the series. The Wolverines 
opened the game with a swift relief 
of Indiana’s offense. Left-hander 
Jacob Denner and the Michigan 
defense allowed a single through 
to left field but quickly grounded 
out the remaining Hoosier batters 
to give the Wolverines a scoring 

opportunity.

“Talking to (redshirt sophomore 

left-handerSteven 
Hajjar) 
and 

(sophomore right-hander Cameron 
Weston) really helped me,” Denner 
said. “Really thinking about a game 
plan to attack those hitters, who are 
all extremely talented.”

In the second inning, Michigan 

capitalized. 
Fifth-year 
shortstop 

Benjamin Sems and Burton had back-
to-back singles to put the Wolverines 
on first and third. After a sacrificial 
flyout by fifth-year catcher Griffin 
Mazur, Michigan put the first score 
on the board. 

Sophomore infielder Tito Flores 

continued the hitting barrage by 
crushing an RBI double into left field 
to push the Wolverines up 2-0.

Michigan added another score in 

the fourth after Burton hit a double 
to center field and finished with a 
run on a wild pitch. Burton was able 
to initiate the Wolverines’ offense 
when it mattered most — which 
would allow the defense to continue 
to flourish.

“We say our best defense is our 

offense,” Proctor said. “To show 

that we can put up those types of 
numbers gives our pitching staff 
and defense all the confidence in the 
world.”

Despite allowing a lone home run 

in the fifth, Michigan continued to 
negate Indiana’s offense and give 
itself opportunities in the batters’ 
box.

Senior right-hander Blake Beers 

pitched in relief for Denner in the 

seventh, immediately striking out 
the first Hoosier batter he faced. 
After giving up a single, Beers and the 
Michigan defense cleaned up with a 
critical ground out to maintain the 

Wolverines’ lead at 3-1. 

“For (Beers) to jump into a role 

as a high-leverage reliever is a huge 
boost for us,” Michigan coach Erik 
Bakich said. “He throws 95, 97 with 
a nasty breaking ball as well. When 

he’s filling up the strike zone with 
those two pitches like he was today, 
he’s really good.”

Junior right-hander Willie Weiss 

replaced Beers in the eighth, striking 
out Indiana utility player Drew 
Ashley, who had given the Hoosiers 
quality offensive production the 
day before. The Wolverines made 
another pitching change after Weiss 
gave up two walks, putting junior 
right-hander Will Proctor on the 
mound.

“Something that’s been instilled 

in us since the fall is a ‘next man up’ 
attitude,” Proctor said. “If one guy 
can’t get it done, it’ll be the next guy. 
That attitude is the bread and butter 
on this team.”

Proctor and the Michigan defense 

quickly got themselves out of trouble, 
grounding out Indiana to maintain 
the Wolverines’ lead and looked to 
close out the game. Almost mirroring 
the second inning, Sems and Burton 
again hit singles to put runners on 
base, and Flores had another RBI 
double to put Michigan up 4-1.

Beniers, Power selected to play in World Championships

Michigan falls to Pepperdine 4-0 in round of 16

Michigan will have the chance to 

see a couple of its young stars compete 
for their national teams later this 
month. 

On Thursday, it was announced 

that 
freshman 
forward 
Matty 

Beniers would be suiting up for Team 
USA at the 2021 International Ice 
Hockey Federation (IIHF) World 
Championships — taking place in 
Riga, Latvia. Beniers will be joined 
at the tournament by freshman 
defenseman Owen Power, who was 
named to Team Canada’s roster. 

The collegiate teammates will now 

face-off as international rivals. 

Beniers 
has 
prior 
experience 

playing for Team USA, as he was 
part of the World Juniors team that 
won gold in January. Beniers had a 
quiet tournament, with just one goal 
and two assists, but the experience 
is something that will stick with him 
forever. 

“I think that’s one of the best 

moments of my life so far, definitely 
the 
best 
hockey 
moment 
I’ve 

experienced,” Beniers said in January. 

“It was just an awesome experience 
to play with such great players on 
my team and definitely an awesome 
experience to play with such great 
players against us.”

After helping Team USA win gold 

at World Juniors for the first time 
since 2017, Beniers is hoping to help 
the team end a much longer medal 
drought at the World Championships. 
Team USA has not won gold since 
1960, and most recently won Bronze 
in 2018. 

At just 18 years old, Beniers will be 

the youngest member of Team USA. 
Youth was no issue for Beniers during 
his freshman campaign with the 
Wolverines, as he racked up 10 goals 
and 14 assists on the year and earned 
a spot on the Big Ten all-freshman 
team. He’ll hope to build on his 
Juniors performance and collect the 
second gold medal of his young career. 

Power, meanwhile, will make his 

long-awaited debut for Team Canada. 
The defenseman was expecting to 
compete with Beniers while playing 
for his country at World Juniors but, 
facing the prospects of missing the 
first half of the collegiate season due 
to COVID-19 protocols with the 
Canadian team, Michigan coach 

Mel Pearson made a controversial 
decision to hold Power out of the 
tournament. 

“I think the decision to have me 

stay here and play was fine. I think 
either way it was a good decision,” 
Power said after not going to Juniors. 
“I think just being able to stay here and 

just develop with the team was a good 
decision.”

Chiara Lommer felt the weight of 

the world on her shoulders. 

After dropping her first set 6-1, the 

fifth-year senior was down 5-3, 40-0 
— one point away from Michigan’s 
season and her illustrious career as a 
Wolverine coming to a close. 

Lommer would not go away, 

playing relentless defense to eek out 

two straight points to chip away at a 
nearly insurmountable lead. 

In 
the 
following 
point, 
her 

outstretched backhand sailed just 
wide, giving No. 5 Pepperdine (22-3) a 
4-0 victory over the Wolverines(19-3) 
in the round of 16 at the NCAA Team 
Championship.

Up against a deep, talented singles 

lineup from Pepperdine, the doubles 
point offered the Wolverines the 
opportunity to take an early lead. 

When the No. 3 doubles tandem 

of sophomore Andrea Cerdan and 
senior Bella Lorenzini jumped out 
to a 4-1 advantage, it looked like 
Michigan could do just that.

Yet 
the 
Wolverines’ 
lead 

evaporated, as the Wave’s Jessica 
Failla and Anastasia Lamachkine 
rattled off six straight games to 
steal the doubles point from the 
Wolverines and take a 1-0 lead.

“I thought Pepperdine played 

really well,” Michigan coach Ronni 
Bernstein said. “That’s a team I 
think that could possibly win (the 
Championship). We needed to play 
a perfect match and we did not do 
that.”

At No.1 singles, freshman Kari 

Miller was stacked up against three-
time All-American Ashley Lahey. 
While Miller took advantage of errors 
from Lahey to take an early lead, 
Miller was unable to close, as Lahey 
staved off multiple breakpoints to 
scrap her way to a 6-4 victory in the 
first set.

Despite a deflating loss in the first 

set, Miller came out with vengeance 
in the second set and took control.

“Kari is in every match she plays,” 

Bernstein said. “It’s a little bit that 

she’s young because she was up 40-0 
a couple games in the first set and had 
a lot of opportunities. But Kari at the 
top of the lineup has been incredible 
for us. She’s up in the second set and 
still fighting and the kid she’s playing 
is a fifth-year and was number one in 
the country last year. That just shows 
you what Kari Miller is going to be for 
Michigan.”

Fellow freshman Jaedan Brown 

found herself in an early 3-0 deficit at 
No. 4 singles against Shiori Fukuda. 
After strong play from the baseline 
got her back in the match, Brown’s 
struggles serving lead to a 6-4, 6-1 
defeat. 

The Waves’ Taisiya Pachkaleva 

moved Cerdan all around the court 
to take a dominant 6-0 victory in the 
first at No. 3 singles. 

Cerdan 
kept 
her 
composure, 

jumping out to a 2-0 lead in the 
second set, but Pachkaleva quickly 
retook the lead en route to a 6-3 win. 

At No. 5 singles, Senior Alyvia 

Jones found herself in a back-and-
forth affair against Lisa Zaar. With 
her team falling behind, Jones 
delivered 
a 
dominant 
serving 

performance complemented by 5 aces 
to earn a 6-4 first-set victory, hoping 

to be a catalyst for the rest of the team. 

Jones’ success continued as she 

was leading 5-1 in the second before 
Pepperdine clinched the victory.

“She was so close to getting us a 

point there,” Bernstein said. “She’s a 
great kid and she cares so much about 
our program and fought hard today. 
She’s one that’s asking the score and 
wants to know what’s going on (with 
her teammates).”

As 
Michigan’s 
three 
seniors 

continued to fight to close the Waves’ 
3-0 lead, the weight of the moment 
set in. 

“These guys play tennis for I don’t 

know how long,” Bernstein said. “I 
think they realize it’s the end at some 
point. They’ve done so much for our 
program. They’ve brought so much 
leadership. Bella, Chiara, and Alyvia 
were great Michigan players and are 
going to be part of our program for a 
long time.”

While the seniors will move on, the 

exceptional play from the Wolverines’ 
freshman players throughout the 
season put the rest of women’s tennis 
on notice. This team is young and 
getting better.
