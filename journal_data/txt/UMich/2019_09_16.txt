ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

An audience of 150 gathered 
Friday 
afternoon 
in 
the 
Annenberg Auditorium of the 
Ford School of Public Policy for 
a talk titled “Diplomacy in a New 
Transatlantic Era.” The event 
featured a conversation between 
former National Security Advisor 
Stephen Hadley; former Assistant 
Secretary of State for European 
and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried; 
and President and CEO of the U.S. 
Global Leadership Coalition Liz 
Schrayer.
The speakers examined key 
diplomatic challenges facing the 
United States and the crucial 
role international affairs has in 
fostering the well-being of citizens 
within its borders. 
The discussion was held in 
conjunction with the launch of 
the Weiser Diplomacy Center and 
the Ford School’s Conversations 
Across Difference Initiative, a 
series aimed at fostering fruitful 
conversation across the political 
divide. 
The 
event 
began 
with 
a 
reflection by University Regent 
Ron Weiser (R) on the significance 

of the opening of the Weiser 
Diplomacy center — specifically in 
the Midwest. 
“Diplomacy can help change 
directions, especially for countries 
that are going in the wrong 

direction — sometimes you can 
bring them back around,” Weiser 
said. “Most of the diplomatic 
institutions of higher learning are 
in the east coast and the west coast, 
and there wasn’t anything in the 

central part of the country … and I 
feel the central part of the country 
has a great deal of importance.”

Six 
demonstrators 
who 
were 
charged 
with 
trespassing during a sit-in at 
the Fleming Administration 
Building following the March 
Climate 
Strike 
appeared 
in court for their pretrial 
hearing 
Friday 
morning. 
The hearing was meant to 
simplify the facts of the case 
and discuss the evidence 
presented before Oct. 10, 
when the official motion is 
scheduled to take place. 
According to Ann Arbor 
attorney 
Angie 
Martell, 
who 
is 
representing 
all 
demonstrators, two of those 
charged were out of state at 
the time of the hearing. 
On 
June 
17, 
six 
demonstrators 
appeared 
in court for the first time. 
They were arraigned and 
pleaded not guilty to the 
trespassing charges, which 
bear a maximum charge of a 
$250 fine with or without 30 
days in jail. During the June 
hearing, the demonstrators 
were released on a personal 
recognizance bond, meaning 
they did not have to pay bail. 
They were told they cannot 
enter the Fleming building; 
use alcohol, marijuana or 
other illegal drugs; or leave 

the state without permission 
of the court.
In light of the upcoming 
Jewish 
holidays, 
Circuit 
Court Judge Karen Quinlan 
Valvo, who presided over 
Friday’s 
hearing, 
lifted 
the ban on alcohol for the 
demonstrators who are over 
21. 
After the Climate Strike 
on March 15, during which 
an 
estimated 
2,500-3,000 
students, 
faculty 
and 
community members rallied 
on 
the 
Diag 
in 
protest 
against inaction relating to 
matters of climate change, 
demonstrators 
flooded 
University President Mark 
Schlissel’s 
office 
in 
the 
Fleming building for a seven-
and-a-half-hour sit-in. The 
demonstrators’ chief demand 
was a one-hour meeting with 
Schlissel and other members 
of 
the 
administration 
to 
discuss the University’s plan 
to achieve carbon neutrality. 
A group of demonstrators 
refused to leave until the 
University addressed their 
demands, 
leading 
to 
the 
arrests of 10 individuals on 
charges of trespassing — two 
of whom were minors.

Students and activists of the 
Sunrise Movement held a sit-in 
at the Ypsilanti office of U.S. 
Rep Debbie Dingell, D-Mich, 
where they shared stories, 
sang, chanted and expressed 
their 
concerns 
about 
the 
impact of climate change to 
her staffers present in the 
office, occupying the space 
past business hours.
Sunrise, 
a 
movement 
of 
predominantly young people 
whose goal is to stop climate 
change and create green jobs, 
has chapters across the nation 
and is a champion of the Green 
New Deal, introduced by Rep. 
Alexandria 
Ocasio-Cortez, 
D-N.Y. The Ann Arbor hub 
of Sunrise has been trying to 

convince Dingell to co-sponsor 
the Green New Deal since 
February, but has not yet been 
successful. 
LSA 
junior 
Preston 
VanAlstine, one of the Ann 
Arbor Hub coordinators, said 
Dingell has been opposed to 
the idea of co-sponsoring the 
bill, and Sunrise has responded 
accordingly. 
“She’s been really resistant, 
so we’ve been slowly escalating 
in terms of our actions over the 
past few months,” VanAlstine 
said. “This election season 
alone she’s taken over $10,000 
from DTE, which gets two-
thirds of its energy from coal. 
So we want her to stop taking 
money from them as well.”
The group of about 30 
protesters, 
which 
included 
University of Michigan and 

high 
school 
students 
and 
community 
members 
from 
across 
Washtenaw 
County, 
marched to her office holding 
signs 
saying 
“We 
Demand 
a Future” and “Green Jobs 
for All” where they filled up 
the lobby of the office while 
three of her staffers watched 
and listened to the different 
stories, demands, songs and 
chants. 
Many of those who spoke 
during the sit-in cited the 
economic 
benefits 
of 
the 
Green New Deal as something 
important to them, connecting 
it to their own experiences 
and 
how 
they 
have 
been 
impacted by climate change. 
LSA sophomore Arya Kale, an 
active member of the Sunrise 
Movement, spoke about his 
time volunteering in a soup 

kitchen where he met a young 
girl whose father had lost his 
job at General Motors Corp. 
Kale felt an instant connection 
because 
GM 
employed 
his 
father as well. 
“I don’t believe that people 
of Black or Brown communities 
should have to suffer without 
having a job,” Kale said. “I 
don’t believe that children 
should not know where their 
next meal is coming from 
because their parents don’t 
have work. And with the Green 
New Deal, with the federal job 
guarantee that’s written in it 
— Representative Dingell, have 
you read that part? — that’s 
important, that’s why we need 
a Green New Deal.”

ALEC COHEN/Daily
Students from the School of Information work on creating new ideas for water safety improvement at a Multidisciplinary Design Jam in the 
UMSI Engagement Center Friday afternoon.

DESIGN BY ALEC COHEN

Throughout 
the 
process, 
the 
students 
incorporated 
feedback from stakeholders, 
including two representatives 
from the Great Lakes Water 
Safety 
Consortium, 
Jamie 
Racklyeft and Dan Metcalf.
Design Jams were launched in 
2017 by a group of organizers from 
the School of Information, the 
Law School, the School of Public 
Health and the Center for Academic 
Innovation as a way to encourage 
interdisciplinary 
dialogue 
and 
generate 
possible 
solutions 
to 
large-scale problems based on the 
Innovation in Action challenges. 
According to Scott TenBrink, 
manager 
of 
UMSI’s 
Citizen 
Experience Design program and 
one of the event organizers, Design 
Jams provide the stakeholders 
with new ideas and also benefit 
the participating students who 
are exposed to interdisciplinary 
problem-solving. 
“We’ve worked with the Law 
School, Engineering, Public Health, 
and continue to try to reach out and 

get more people involved to provide 
this 
kind 
of 
multidisciplinary 
experience,” TenBrink said. 
The Water Safety Design Jam 
topic was suggested by Jamie 
Racklyeft, executive director and 
founder of the Great Lakes Water 
Safety Consortium, who reached 
out after hearing about Design Jams 
through a colleague.
Racklyeft 
founded 
the 
Consortium in 2016 after nearly 
drowning in 2012 due to a riptide 
in Lake Michigan, at Van’s Beach 
in Leland. According to Racklyeft, 
the consortium aims to eventually 
end drowning in the Great Lakes 
and focuses on helping people more 
safely enjoy the water. Currently, 
there are over 3,500 drownings 
in the United States annually and 
there have been more than 800 
in the Great Lakes since tracking 
started in 2010. The Great Lakes 
Water Consortium also states that 
drowning is the number one cause 
of death in children between ages 1 
and 4. 
Racklyeft said he was grateful for 
the opportunity to hear students’ 
creative ideas on how to tackle the 
drowning epidemic. 
“To have some of the best and 

brightest students coming at this 
from a fresh perspective with the 
cutting-edge problem-solving skills 
they have, like design thinking and 
so on, is really, really exciting,” 
Racklyeft said.
Racklyeft said there are a few 
basic steps that need to be taken to 
prevent drownings. People need to 
be able to swim; they need to have 
information on water safety, lake 
conditions and riptides; they need 
to have access to a lifeguard and 
safety equipment; and they should 
be familiar with the mantra “Flip, 
Float, Follow,” a drowning survival 
technique. One major challenge, 
Racklyeft said, is disseminating 
water 
safety 
information 
and 
getting swimmers to actually take 
measures toward improved water 
safety, so the Consortium is looking 
for new, innovative strategies. 
“There’s a lot of fundamentals 
that we know, but then we know 
that we need more innovative 
approaches, especially in how to 
persuade people,” Racklyeft said. 
“It’s one thing to inform them 
about the danger, but it’s another 
to get them to actually change their 
behavior towards something a little 
safer, like putting on a life jacket, 
like swimming near a lifeguard, 
like making sure there’s rescue 
equipment if necessary, or just in 
general, if it looks like it might be 
dangerous, trust that little voice.”
Racklyeft kicked off the Design 
Jam by discussing the importance 
of water safety and sharing his 
story. According to TenBrink, after 
Racklyeft shared a video about 
his experience and the emotional 
impact of drownings, the room 
fell silent. TenBrink said Friday’s 
Design Jam was unique in that it 
centered around a heavy topic. 
Even if students don’t have 
direct experience with drownings, 
TenBrink said he feels it’s a topic 
many people can connect to 
emotionally. 
“When you think about Great 
Lakes drowning, maybe you’re not 
directly connected to that, but it 
feels like something that would be 
really great to be part of a solution 
for,” TenBrink said. 
Most of the groups focused 
on ways to better spread water 
safety 
information 
and 
make 
safety equipment more accessible. 
Ideas included a kids’ water safety 
mascot similar to Smokey the Bear, 

who represents fire safety; a safety 
sign connected to a push message 
and Amber Alert; a kids cereal box 
with information; a “Flip, Float, 
Follow” social media campaign 
and different methods of supplying 
safety kits and materials on beaches. 
The groups built or drew small-
scale prototypes of their ideas and 
pitched them to the stakeholders, 
then had ten minutes to refine their 
products. The groups then gave 
two-minute presentations to the 
room. 
The winning idea picked by the 
stakeholders was a multifaceted 
approach to encouraging the usage 
of safety equipment, especially 
life jackets. Information junior 
Sai Surbehera, a member of the 
winning team, pointed out that 
almost 90 percent of drowning 
victims in the U.S were not wearing 
life jackets. His team aimed to 
make life vests more accessible by 
providing safety equipment stations 
on beaches. 
Surbehera said there are many 
psychological 
reasons 
for 
not 
wearing a life vest, including 
tanning or wanting to look cool. 
Surbehera’s team tried to confront 
the problem by conceptualizing a 
Snapchat filter that would turn a life 
vest into six-pack abs. According to 
Surbehera, this also played upon 
the fact that the vast majority of 
drowning victims are male. 
One interesting aspect of the 
Design Jam, Surbehera said, was 
working with a group representing a 
wide range of backgrounds. Most of 
his group members came from areas 
with many beachfronts, including 
New Jersey, Washington state and 
Michigan, but each member had a 
different understanding of beach 
culture. As a result, Surbehera said, 
the team could better address some 
of the cultural factors affecting life 
jacket usage. 
In announcing the winning 
team, 
Racklyeft 
said 
the 
stakeholders found the focus on 
life jackets compelling, since so 
few drowning victims are wearing 
safety equipment. Still, he said 
he was impressed by all the ideas 
and plans to incorporate them 
into the Great Lakes Water Safety 
Consortium’s future work.

Monday, September 16, 2019— 3A

 
This 
summer, 
I 
studied 
abroad for 3 months in Prague, 
Czech Republic. I knew I 
wanted to do this program 
before 
I 
even 
started 
my 
freshman year at the University 
of 
Michigan, 
so 
this 
was 
really exciting for me. Aside 
from Prague, I also had the 
opportunity to visit other small 
cities in the Czech Republic, 
Italy, Switzerland, Germany, 
Hungary, and Austria. It was a 
great experience to be able to go 
to local events, immerse myself 
in different cultures and meet 
people abroad who I wouldn’t 
normally have run into in my 
hometown in New Jersey or at 
school in Ann Arbor. 
 
That being said, I 
soon began to realize that as 
an 
Asian-American 
girl 
in 
Europe, I was a “rare breed.” 
That meant that I was getting 
a lot of stares while just going 
about my day, minding my own 
business. This is something I’ve 
experienced heavily in China as 
well, but the context in Europe 
was totally different. In China, 
people stared at me because I 
looked Westernized, American 
(or at least I presume) –– they 
knew I wasn’t “one of them”. 
In Prague, people stared at me 
in a fetishizing, she’s-so-exotic 

way. 
This was very surprising to 
me given what people told me 
about the sizeable Vietnamese 
population in Prague, and the 
fact that most of Prague’s mini 
marts, Asian restaurants and 
nail salons were run by Asian 
people. So my first thought was, 
Of course they’ve seen Asians. 
But I guess it’s different when 
it’s an Asian who is firstly, 
American (or doesn’t speak 
Czech) 
and 
secondly, 
who 
does not work in their service 
industry. Often times I would 
be 
heard 
speaking 
perfect 
English in a perfect American 
accent, and still get asked if 
I was from Asi –– and not be 
believed when I said I was from 
the states. Men would fetishize 
me 
because 
they’d 
“gotten 
sick of seeing white European 
girls all the time” and I was 
“different.” 
 
If there was one thing 
I learned from my time in 
Europe, it was that Europeans 
don’t view race in the same 
way Americans do –– and this 
makes sense, given how racially 
homogenous countries like the 
Czech Republic are. In Europe, 
the distinction is based more 
heavily instead on nationality. 
I noticed that Czech people had 
clear distinctions on who was 
Czech and who was Slovakian 
or Slovenian –– even within 
the country itself, there seemed 

to be a split between Bohemia 
and Moravia, the two main 
regions of the Czech Republic. 
So in a sense, Europeans 
were seemingly “color-blind” 
and didn’t realize it could 
be harmful to ignore race, 
especially in my experience. 
The distinction was much more 
heavily based on ethnicity and 
nationality, so it was confusing 
for many Europeans when I 
told them I was American when 
I am a person of East Asian 
descent. 
While I had some awkward 
run-ins with this, it gave me a 
broader sense of how people 
from other countries view race 
and identity –– and not all of it 
was ignorant. Some Vietnamese 
shop 
owners 
would 
speak 
to me in Czech and ask me 
where I was from because they 
were excited to see another 
familiar face in the city, and 
others would ask me about 
my experiences in America. 
Overall, studying abroad didn’t 
“change my life” in the cliché 
way, but it definitely enriched 
my life. Though the experience 
wasn’t perfect, I do have that 
special place for Central Europe 
in my heart and have gotten 
better with leaning into slight 
discomfort by attempting to 
learn Czech and pushing myself 
to take more of an initiative 
with things I wouldn’t normally 
think of doing back home.

Race and identity 
abroad

There were two women in the 
fitting room who were targeted 
by a manager as potential thieves 
in the store (Anthropologie 
likes to refer to them as “Nick” 
and “Nicky”). I interacted with 
them, and another employee, 

who didn’t interact with them, 
asked me what race they were. 
When I asked, “Why does that 
matter?” she replied that Black 
and Hispanic women were more 
likely to steal.

One woman complained that 
the new plus-size section was 
taking up too much space in the 
store and lowered the clothing 

options of the “regular” or 
“standard” (as Anthropologie 
likes to call them) clothes.

This summer, I worked part-
time 
at 
Anthropologie 
and 
was reminded of all the ways 
in which the retail industry 

can be problematic. Here’s a 
shortlist of some of the things I 
encountered:

While I was working at the 
cash register, I overheard a 
fellow employee next to me get 
yelled at by a white customer. 
My fellow employee and the 
manager were trying to explain 

the change in the return policy, 
but the customer kept saying 
they were wrong and she wasn’t 
being understood; she yelled at 
them, “You’re talking to me like 
I’m speaking Chinese!”

Yikes. Big, big yikes. I could 
write separately about each of 
these encounters, but piecing 
them all together reveals just 
how racist the industry can be 
(I’m looking at you, H&M and 
Gucci and Sephora) and how 
it’s far from inclusive of all 
body types (Brandy Melville, 
anyone?). These are all deeply 
intertwined and compounded 
by other factors, too — gender 
identity 
and 
socioeconomic 
status, for example — and just 

because things look like they’re 
starting to improve (like how 
more stores are including plus-
size options), doesn’t mean 
the retail world has suddenly 
become un-problematic.
In fact, far from it. Stores still 
racially profile and target people 
of color for stealing (I witnessed 
that a lot this summer); they 
still often only carry what we 
think of as “normal” sizes; and 
still so many brands are fast-
fashion, unsustainable for the 

environment 
and 
dangerous 
for their workers (on the flip 
side, more sustainable clothing 
isn’t accessible to people of low 
socioeconomic status).
Working retail was a way 
for me to make money this 
summer, especially since my 
internship was unpaid. But, it’s 
not something I would want to 
go back to — unless there was 
actual, concrete change in the 
industry.

A white woman once asked 
me, “Does this store have a 
petite-size section?” When I 
told her we didn’t, she put her 
hands on her hips and said, 
exasperatedly, “I just don’t 

understand why you don’t have 
a petite-size section when you 
have a plus-size section. Isn’t 
that discrimination? I’m a petite 
woman, I feel discriminated 
against.”

The pitfalls of 
retail

Sometimes I think about 
what we actually hold in 
our heads. What are we 
thinking 
about 
that 
is 

substantial? How are we 
processing the lives we 
lead? What do we open up 
to others for everyone to 

peer into? We wear the 
stains of life on our whole 
body. There’s nothing to 
hide.

So many times I’ve looked at 
the blue of these skies and been 
reminded of the blue of the 
ocean. But of course one owes 
itself to the other. Perhaps it 

is the perfect harmony that 
one expanse sits with us and 
sustains us on land, while the 
other remains watchful above. 
My Ma boli taught me that 

if you spit at the sky it will 
fall back on you. Perhaps this 
is because the sky rejects the 
hate we give it, and leaves it to 
the water to carry it away.

N

o 
one 
likes 
it 
— 
disagreement.
It’s 
uncomfortable. 
It manages to creep its way 
into 
many 
a 
conversation, 
ranging from a new show on 
television your friend thinks is 
great (but you find genuinely 
terrible) to a political issue. 
It can be the elephant in the 
room at Thanksgiving dinner 
or in a group project. There is 
something inherent in human 
nature to avoid tension at almost 
all costs, to smooth over the 
potential discomfort and just 
agree or refuse to acknowledge 
something. 
This past summer, I found 
myself 
in 
a 
conversation 
about 
disagreement. 
I 
had 
just attended a political event, 
and my friend had struck up 
a conversation while we were 
there with a person who had 
entirely different ideas on the 
issue addressed at the event. She 
said, while they disagreed, they 
were able to openly talk about 
their perspectives on the given 
issue and find common ground. 
This is not the norm, as I am 
keenly aware. 
Disagreement seems to be 
entirely present in society today: 
from pundits on Sunday morning 
talk shows undercutting one 
another regarding the state of 
our nation to the most recent 
spat between Democrats and 
Republicans on the Hill. There 
are endless channels through 
which division flows, and while 
not all forms of disagreement 
are intrinsically bad, I cannot 
argue all are healthy either. I 
believe, sometimes, individuals 
get so wrapped up in their 
own views they refuse to 
acknowledge that not everyone 
feels the same way. 
Coming 
to 
college 
gave 
me exposure to perspectives 
and viewpoints outside of my 
personal realm of familiarity. 
I had never been confronted 
with the possibility that so 
many people felt the same, 
particularly 
with 
regard 
to 

political or social issues, but 
that so many also felt differently 
and that there were platforms 
to discuss these differences so 
openly. In the past, I had ducked 
these contentious conversations 
about 
politics 
with 
family 
members and others, knowing 
we may disagree. I never had 
so many venues to voice how I 
felt about different issues, and I 
know I am not alone in this. 

How 
can 
we 
as 
college 
students and beyond move past 
the fear of creating division 
and work towards productive 
conversation? How can we turn 
disagreement and the constant 
back-and-forth 
so 
prevalent 
in 
the 
media, 
politics 
and 
popular culture into something 
constructive? 
I 
know 
I 
am 
strongly 
opinionated and often tense 
up when I hear arguments I 
don’t agree with or when I 
know a disagreement could 
arise between friends, family 
members, classmates or even 
strangers. I struggle knowing 
there is continuous disagreement 
over the little, and, often times, 
larger issues. However, I know 
as I grow into my own beliefs 
as a college student and adult, I 
need to be comfortable knowing 
disagreement is a fact of life, 
avoidable or not, and invite 
conversation instead of shying 
away from it.
As my friend reflected on her 
discussion with the individual 

at the political event, something 
stuck with me. She said, up until 
recently, if she had been faced 
with the same conversation, 
she would have failed to even 
try to see their perspective and, 
instead, would have stuck to 
her own ideological agenda. I, 
in all honesty, probably would 
have done something similar. I 
challenge myself and others, in 
an age when we quiver at the 
thought of contention or fight 
to prove each other wrong, to 
find common ground. I am not 
saying all contrary opinions 
are a good thing or a similarity 
can always be found, as there is 
no place for bigotry, hatred or 
discrimination in any place or 
conversation. What I am saying 
is we need to recognize that with 
the prevalence of disagreement 
comes the responsibility of 
making it constructive and 
finding a middle ground instead 
of remaining in a place of socio-
political stagnation.
We owe it to ourselves, our 
communities, 
our 
campus 
and our country to take a 
step back and recognize the 
power of listening first and 
talking second. Disagreement 
is 
everywhere, 
but 
the 
humanizing 
moments 
are 
those 
in 
which 
individuals 
of differing perspectives can 
recognize, while they may not 
see eye to eye, there is space 
for 
conversation 
and 
some 
form of agreement. As we 
begin the new school year, let 
us work toward collaborating, 
understanding 
and 
creating 
spaces in which disagreement 
can be constructive. Let us 
welcome conversation instead 
of pointing fingers. Let us find 
common ground, which is the 
only way disagreement can turn 
from potentially being spiteful 
to being productive. It is time to 
move past contention and work 
toward 
making 
substantive 
socio-political change.

Finding common ground

Facing ethics in a CS career

SAMANTHA SZUHAJ | COLUMN

I 

t’s recruiting season, and that 
means North Campus at the 
University of Michigan is being 
flooded with companies desperate 
for computer science talent. This 
past week, Microsoft, Palantir and 
Uber had events on North Campus, 
and this week’s engineering career 
fair will host more than 300 
companies, most of them recruiting 
computer science students. It’s a 
good time to be studying CS, which 
is part of why it’s now the second 
largest undergraduate major at the 
University, only behind a Bachelor’s 
degree from the Ross School of 
Business. With all the resources and 
diplomas going to these students, 
what does a University of Michigan 
CS education prepare them for?
Increasingly, it seems, life at a big 
tech company.
Facebook, 
Amazon, 
Google, 
Microsoft and Apple were five of the 
top eight employers of engineering 
graduates from the University in 
2018. The University is promoting this 
fact, highlighting these companies 
in an annual report on engineering 
grad employment — but is it really 
something we should be proud of?
Tech companies are increasingly 
doing work that should raise ethical 
concerns. Palantir builds tools that 
help ICE detain and deport migrants; 
Amazon sells facial recognition 
software to police departments and 
creates neighborhood dragnets with 
Ring; Facebook continually violates 
user privacy and stokes extremism; 
and Google (until recently) provided 
AI for the Pentagon’s drone program. 
As the digital revolution continues, 
issues like these will only grow more 
common and more serious. Yet, ethics 
are rarely found in the University’s 
CS curriculum, and concern for these 
issues seems to be rare among the 
student body. 
It’s time computer science students 
consider the morality and ethics of 
where they work and what they work 
on. A CS degree from the University 
provides a wealth of opportunities. 
Too often, though, it seems students’ 
career decisions are based solely on 
factors such as prestige, salary and 
benefits — with little thought or 
preparation for the moral quandaries 
presented by their work.
CS students often view a job in 
big tech as an indication that they’ve 

“made it.” It proves to people that 
they’re smart. When comparing 
companies, students trade stories 
about free lunches, comped-parties 
and massive bonuses while neglecting 
discussions of what they worked on, 
it’s impact or the workplace culture. 
This environment is part of what 
leads to three-hour lines at Facebook 
and Google’s career fair tables and 
the prioritization of perks over 
impact when it comes to work. The 
technology we create is what should 
matter, not paternalistic “benefits” 
and false “prestige.” CS students 
should respect and appreciate all 
types of work — the current situation 
only helps big tech and hurts the rest 
of us. 

The University bears responsibility 
as well. It promotes big tech 
companies and gives little attention 
to other options for employment 
such as non-profits and startups. 
This puts the onus on students to 
find other opportunities, making it 
even harder to avoid the pull of big 
tech. As a CS student myself, I often 
struggled with the feeling that my 
only options were jobs in big tech or 
the financial industry. Additionally, 
because the CS curriculum largely 
avoids any discussion of ethics or the 
societal impact of CS work, issues 
such as data privacy and algorithmic 
bias are rarely, or never, addressed 
in the classroom. Neither are case 
studies about major ethical failures 
and dilemmas in the field. Students 
should have to confront and discuss 
the societal impact of the systems 
they create, not just build projects in 
a vacuum.
For 
students 
aware 
of 
the 
responsibilities 
that 
come 
with 
their power as computer scientists, 
working in big tech may even be the 
right choice. With the potential to 

affect millions or billions of people 
with their code and the shortage of 
CS talent, there is little precedent 
for the power that computer 
scientists have today. Because of 
this, collective action by computer 
scientists can have a substantial 
impact on the places they work, 
and by extension, the world. In 
the past year we’ve seen Google 
employees instigate changes to 
sexual harassment policies, end 
the company’s Pentagon contract 
and halt the development of a 
censored search engine for China. 
Enlightened students could work 
from the inside on many of the hard 
problems facing these companies, 
encouraging reform and helping 
navigate tech to a more sustainable 
place. Sending engineers to big 
tech with little awareness of the 
implications of their work ignores 
the realities of today’s world 
and misses an opportunity for 
meaningful change.
The culture of apathy among 
CS students must come to an end. 
The technology we create and 
companies we work for have too 
much of an impact for us to ignore our 
moral and ethical responsibilities. 
These responsibilities should be 
an integral part of a CS education. 
Individual classes should discuss 
ethical considerations and case 
studies related to their topic, and 
instead of a humanities requirement 
often serving as a blow-off class, 
the University should institute a 
dedicated technology and society 
requirement. These changes would 
be a valuable and overdue update 
to the CS curriculum and follow in 
the footsteps of other universities. 
Additionally, the University should 
do more to promote opportunities 
outside of big tech. The startup 
career fair is a good start, but we 
need more emphasis and options. As 
a University and as individuals, we 
have a responsibility to consider our 
impact on the world. It’s time to live 
up to the stated objectives of our CS 
program and prepare graduates to 
“recognize the implications of their 
work” and “contribute substantively, 
as leaders, to science, technology, 
and society.”

Whitmer, expand the ban

E

arlier this month, Michigan passed a ban on flavored e-cigarettes 
after a string of illnesses and deaths were linked to vaporizers. The 
response was announced under emergency rules created by Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer in part because many of those affected were minors. The 
ban outlaws the sale of fruity e-cigarette flavors, like mango and cherry, but 
does not limit the sale of flavors like mint, menthol and tobacco.

The response to this bill 
has been mixed, with many 
praising Whitmer for pushing 
Michigan to be the first state 
to take action against the 
epidemic of recreational vape 
use by minors. Others, like 
business owners and legal 
e-cigarette 
users, 
believe 
this is a poor decision that 
could cause businesses to lose 
money or lead people to seek 
out illegal sources of flavored 
vaping products, which can 
be dangerous. The Editorial 
Board believes this legislation 
is a small step in the right 
direction, but it is rushed and 
insufficient.
There is no denying the 
problem 
between 
minors 
and 
nicotine. 
E-cigarette 
usage has skyrocketed since 
products like Juul hit the 
market, 
and 
a 
significant 
number of those new users 
have been minors. Even here 
at the University of Michigan, 
it probably isn’t hard to find 
someone who has illegally 
vaped before. The rhetoric 
expressed in the media tends 
to blame these young people 
for their addiction, citing the 
vaping craze as a Generation Z 
phenomenon and diminishing 
its seriousness. But young 
people are a vulnerable group, 
susceptible 
to 
the 
precise 
marketing 
of 
e-cigarette 
companies, peer pressure and 
curiosity. Young vape addicts 
need to be viewed as people 
with just that — an addiction.
A 
major 
cause 
of 
this 
epidemic comes from the way 
these products are marketed 
and 
presented 
to 
youth. 
Companies like Juul make 
their products seem attractive 
and cool. Juul is already under 
investigation 
by 
the 
Food 
and Drug Administration for 
illegal marketing practices, 
claiming their products are 
“safer than cigarettes,” even 
“totally safe,” and for targeting 
minors. Juul has even been 
accused of tailoring their ads 
to schools and summer camps 
and admitted to sponsoring 
a camp in Baltimore when 

interrogated 
by 
a 
U.S. 
House 
of 
Representatives 
subcommittee.
Whitmer’s plan addresses 
this, prohibiting the use of 
words like “clean,” “safe” and 
“healthy” in the marketing 
of 
vaping 
products. 
An 
existing law forbidding vaping 
billboard ads will be more 
strongly enforced with the ban 
as well. As witnessed in the 
opioid crisis, corporations are 
skilled at finding loopholes in 
order to still sell their product. 
Perhaps 
Whitmer 
could 
employ an extended-liability 
model, 
wherein 
companies 
like Juul are legally bound to 
provide reparations to those 
harmed by their products. 
Outweighing their monetary 
benefit with high costs in 
this way could be enough to 
discourage them from selling 
dangerous products.
Additionally, 
adopting 
European models of marketing 
traditional cigarettes could 
help, such as printing images 
on the packaging that show 
how nicotine damages the 
body. Whitmer could look 
to programs, such as Truth, 
that are able to reach a wide 
array of teenagers because 
they know how to tailor their 
programming 
to 
younger 
audiences effectively. There 
also need to be new programs 
and government Public Service 
Announcements dedicated to 
advising against e-cigarette 
use in minors and helping 
those already affected.
Whitmer’s ban also fails to 
acknowledge that the flavor 
of e-cigarettes will not be 
enough to discourage teens 
from 
vaping. 
Thousands 
of young people now have 
nicotine 
addictions 
that 
will be satisfied one way or 
another, whether it’s from a 
mango-flavored Juul pod or a 
cigarette. For the 354 possible 
recent cases of vaping-related 
lung 
illness 
in 
the 
U.S., 
many involve oils purchased 
from 
unlicensed 
vendors. 
Yesterday, a Wisconsin drug 
bust showed the true extent 

of this hidden market. Police 
found close to 100,000 vaping 
cartridges in a small-town 
condo. Investigators from the 
Center for Disease Control 
believe that “home brews” 
and contaminants such as 
THC found in black market 
vape substances are the most 
likely culprit for the reported 
health issues, rather than the 
standard vaping products that 
have been widely used for 
years. Whitmer’s ban could 
do more harm than good by 
pushing users to look more to 
illegal marketplaces and do-it-
yourself solutions that are 
more likely to cause immediate 
and lasting health problems.
The 
solution 
to 
this 
epidemic does not stop simply 
with bans on vaping products. 
Michigan’s 
youth 
need 
comprehensive rehabilitation 
plans to quell their addictions, 
and this policy should be 
influenced by the young people 
who are being targeted by 
e-cigarette manufacturers, or 
by representatives who truly 
understand 
them. 
Whitmer 
cannot simply ban a product 
and 
then 
leave 
teenagers 
to fend off their addiction 
themselves.
It’s also important to ponder 
Whitmer’s quick action on this 
issue, when other crises – 
like that in Flint – have been 
on-going for years. Whitmer 
hasn’t reinstated free water 
bottles for the citizens after 
former Gov. Rick Snyder cut 
the program, and she did not 
meet her lead pipe replacement 
goal of late July. 
Whitmer’s 
attempt 
at 
solving the vaping epidemic 
is good in principle, but only 
goes so far in combating the 
issue. In order to truly stop 
minors from seeking nicotine 
and THC in harmful ways, 
Whitmer needs to expand her 
plan to include rehabilitation, 
restrictions 
on 
marketing 
and comprehensive, inclusive 
education programs for youth 
on the dangers of e-cigarettes. 
The lives of Michiganders and 
our youth are at stake.

Salman Rushdie has had, in no particular 
order, more than a life’s share of excitement, 
success and peril. His fourth novel, “The Satanic 
Verses,” enraptured both pop culture and world 
politics with its controversial 1989 release 
(leading to, among other things, assassination 
attempts 
against 
Rushdie 
himself). 
He’s 
published nineteen books — fourteen since the 
controversy — for which he’s been awarded a 
Booker and PEN Pinter Prize. This excludes, of 
course, his most recent “Quichotte,” which is 
currently shortlisted for the 2019 Booker, and 
still a potential prize winner.
But 
nothing 
about 
his 
well-completed 
biography is inhibiting Rushdie. “The road 
ahead is shorter than the road behind,” Rushdie 
said to an audience in Rackham Auditorium 
Thursday night. Yet this means little — he’s 
more concentrated on his writing than ever 
before, hoping to put his work to use more 
by diagnosing and accepting its purpose and 
potential.
The event, put on by Literati Bookstore, 
facilitated a talk covering subjects from 
writing methodology to age to immigration. 
In conversation with “PBS Books” host Rich 
Fahle in front of an audience laden with 
new copies of the 400-page “Quichotte,” 
Rushdie made clear that degree of thought 
and intention injected into both his novels 
and philosophy. He spoke easily and quickly 
in response to even controversial political 
topics, though his responses never felt half-
hearted 
or 
incomplete. 
Rushdie’s 
humor 
landed happily — each bit of drollery said with 
script-placed perfection — over the audience. 
Rushdie spoke of the intrigue of a spy novelist 
in his new book, the details pulled from his 
first-hand experience with spies after “The 
Satanic Verses” controversy. And he spoke 
to the ups and downs of the writing process, 
which included hours of binge-watching reality 
television. Done as research for his reality-
television-induced main character, Rushdie 
made it no question that he finds such cultural 

norms absurd. In moments like these Rushdie 
excelled on stage.
Recurring in the conversation was the 
theme of a road in Rushdie’s work, particularly 
“Quichotte.” Compared to his prior novel, 
which was placed entirely in New York City, 
the Booker Shortlister falls over a much larger 
space, with characters traveling during much of 
the story. In writing his earlier novels, Rushdie 
remembered telling himself, “Next time, you 
need to leave town.” It was too restricting, 
being contained to one space. And so he did. 
Hoping to capture the greatness of many novels 
that mechanize movement — “The Hobbit,” say, 
or “Lolita” — Rushdie incorporated the road 
throughout “Quichotte” as his main character 
traversed the country with his (imaginary) son 
in search of love. The road is “an ancient form 
of pilgrimage,” Rushdie explained, a physical 
change that can mirror the internal twists a 
character experiences.
Nearing the end of the discussion, the 
talk turned distinctly political. “Quichotte” 
has been described as a “gutting satire of 
America right now,” and Rushdie owned up 
to such clamor without hesitation. We are in a 
transitional moment, he explained. One where 
things — technologically, politically — are 
changing at a more rapid pace than ever before. 
Much of today’s politics are unrecognizable 
from 
a 
past 
perspective. 
In 
crafting 
“Quichotte,” Rushdie said he hoped to mold a 
comedy with something of a darker side that 
can simultaneously critique and make sense of 
the chaos of present-day America. With these 
hopes he aimed to incorporate subtle themes 
of race and immigration into his reworking of 
“Don Quixote.”
“In times of tyranny, literature becomes 
particularly important,” Rushdie said, looking 
thoughtfully to the crowd at Rackham. Even 
when the state pushes information that may 
not be true, the significance of art remains, 
he explained — it is the artist who gets to set 
the narrative straight. “We get to tell the story 
to the future.” It seemed, throughout his talk, 
that if there is an author of competence this 
responsibility should be delegated to, Rushdie 
may be it.

EVENT REVIEW

JOHN DECKER
Daily Book Review Editor

Walking into the Van Andel Arena, I felt exactly 
as I did when I saw the Jonas Brothers open for 
Miley Cyrus 12 years ago. While the crowd was 
transformed from grade-school girls to college 
students, the rest felt oddly familiar: 2009 tour 
T-shirts, eair-piercing screams, even some tears. 
The Jonas Brothers have become a symbol for the 
golden years of my youth, and the band has played 
into the nostalgia by revisiting the music that now 
serves as an artifact of our childhoods. 
As the lights dimmed in the small arena, the 
screens on stage displayed a video of three young 
boys representing the young Kevin, Joe and Nick. 
The short imagined the boys wandering around a 
carnival scene, and after it ended the brother-band 
floated onto the stage while performing the song 
“Rollercoaster” off their new album, Happiness 
Begins. 
The story of the three boys played a large role 
in the show, with short clips inserted in between 
songs. They included motifs from previous albums 
and resolved with a meeting between the boys and 
their older selves — the current Jonas Brothers. 
The band primarily dedicated the first half of 
the show to their newer music, including popular 
songs like “Cool” and “Only Human.” Sprinkled 
throughout their repertoire of new music were 
some throwbacks as well, including their 2007 hit 
“S.O.S..” 

While the majority of the show was played from 
the main stage, the band migrated to the back of the 
arena where they performed more of their older 
work, including a seven-song medley of some of 
their most popular songs. The show was made a 
unique experience with two song requests taken 
from fans and performances of two tunes from the 
Disney Channel movie “Camp Rock.” Among the 
other iconic songs were their love anthem “When 
You Look Me In The Eyes” and the classic sing-
along “Burnin’ Up.” 
The show itself was very fast-paced, with the 
Brothers jumping into one song after the next 
without much pause, keeping the energy high from 
start to finish. During a brief break, Kevin thanked 
the crowd for “giving us the time to figure it out” 
before the brothers performed the most sentimental 
song of the night: “Comeback.” The trio also gave a 
toast to the crowd, thanking their dedicated fans for 
supporting them back when they were just starting 
their careers and even thanked their fans’ parents 
for taking their kids to their earlier shows. 
Unlike most reunions where bands try to 
rebrand themselves in a totally new way, the Jonas 
Brothers have embraced their past and transformed 
it into something relevant for both themselves and 
their fans today. While the band has gone from 
a group of teenage heartthrobs to a group of men 
with wives and kids, they still hold a special place 
in their fans’ hearts. The brothers are learning and 
growing alongside their fan base, and it’s this kind 
of relationship that makes the Jonas Brothers so 
successful in the music world today. 

The Jonas Brothers bring
back the pure glory of ’07

CONCERT REVIEW

KAITLYN FOX

HOLLYWOOD RECORDS / FLICKR

In the 70-year history of the NBA, in a league 
with personalities and mystiques that tend 
to outshine the sport itself, Dennis Rodman 
manages, to this day, to be the player whose 
legend remains a tier above the rest. So much has 
been written, conjectured and analyzed about 
the Hall of Famer. The new “30 for 30 Rodman: 
For Better or Worse,” narrated by Jamie Foxx, 
provides a valuable and sympathetic look at how 
he became the man behind the myth.
Rodman’s tumultuous childhood is presented 
as the main contributing factor to all the endless 
controversies that followed in later decades. In a 
way, his childhood was a prolonged one. Shy and 
introverted to the extreme, with few interests 
and friends even in high school, his consistent 
conflicts with his family led to extended periods 
of homelessness. Like many “30 for 30”’s focusing 
on a single personality, Rodman is there to narrate 
it all in the image that is more recognizable today. 
Despite all the flash and outlandishness people 
know him for his inherent shyness is on display 
in these interviews. Deion Sanders, as portrayed 
in his own “30 for 30” earlier in the year, is as 
cocky and self-assured as ever in his interviews 
for the film, but when watching “For Better or 
Worse,” it is very easy to see how Rodman is still 
the soft-spoken teenager who got his late start at 
Southeastern Oklahoma State.
The film also features interviews with various 
figures from throughout Rodman’s life, each 
profoundly impacted by the man in extremely 
different ways. Foxx mentions at the beginning 

that reducing Rodman’s life story to a tragedy is 
a massive oversimplification, but hearing from 
his mother, former coaches, friends, teammates 
and others makes it hard to overlook the very 
tragic aspects of his life. Sure, words like ‘lunatic’ 
and ‘crazy’ are thrown around, but one gets the 
impression that these people felt a mixture of 
pity, respect and admiration all at once. Isaiah 
Thomas, the legendary point guard of the “Bad 
Boy” Pistons with whom Rodman felt the closest, 
tears up at a point when describing the sensitive 
nature of Rodman, and how he could not accept 
the fact that the NBA is a business where teams 
don’t always stay together, retire together, as 
families.
Even Michael Jordan himself, one of the 
most sociopathically competitive athletes to 
ever live, speaks about Rodman in a measured, 
understanding manner, recognizing the troubled 
soul lashed out due to a deep-seated anger 
and abandonment issues. However, none of 
these platitudes condone the other realities of 
Rodman’s life the film presents, those in which 
he abandoned his own children from multiple 
mothers. Alexis Rodman, his first child, makes 
the point that she could never understand 
how her own father could treat her the way 
he did, considering her relationship with her 
own children. The documentary suggests it all 
plays into the tragic cycle of abandonment that 
Rodman himself both experienced as a kid and 
contributed to as a father.
Despite the legendary career he had and the 
impact he has had on the league ever since, it is 
clear that there is a sadness that underpins it all, 
and one can hope that he and the people around 
him find peace.

One
Edith Wharton’s second novel, “The House Of Mirth,” depicts a 
world that I knew almost nothing about before picking it up — the 
New York “fashionable” society of the late 19th century, a world that 
mirrors the European aristocracy in its social aesthetic but is made up 
of industrialists, real-estate magnates (like Wharton’s parents), Wall 
Street speculators. That every rich person in America is nouveau riche 
when compared to the European aristocracy means that participation 
in high society has more to do with taste, refinement, manners and 
other immaterial, vague qualities. It’s interesting that this is the social 
formation that accompanied a period of intense income inequality — in 
the Gilded Age, the very rich are mostly concerned with being better at 
being rich than their friends and acquaintances. 
Awaiting women in this world is a system of rigid control structured 
around marriage, and Wharton’s novel is a depiction of the viciousness of 
this system. Her protagonist, Lily Bart, was born into “fashion” but, being 
an orphan, doesn’t have the means to stay there without marrying a rich 
man. She is nearly thirty and is reaching the point where her youthful 
beauty is just beginning to fade — she starts to notice circles around 
her mouth and wrinkles on her forehead — but her problem is really 
more psychological. Having been raised in an environment saturated 
with opulence, she is hesitant to leave it, even as she finds its trappings 
intolerable. The beginning of the novel has her faced with the prospect 
of marrying Percy Gryce, a man so dull she nearly can’t stand spending 
several afternoons with him at a country house. She vacillates between 
feeling incapable of marrying Gryce and feeling like she needs to charm 
him, win him over, so she can at least avoid falling into the “dinginess” 
that surrounds her charmed circle. She is of two minds, on the one hand 
needing to stay in the presence of money at any cost to her mental life, 
and on the other hand fully aware of how ill-suited she is mentally for life 
among the leisure class. 
This aspect of the plot rests on what amount to vague judgements 
about social aesthetics — it’s possible that Wharton’s intended audience 
would have a good awareness of what Lily means in her subtle judgements 
of the habits of the wealthy. For a reader in the 21st century, what comes 
across most readily is the mutability of Lily’s judgements, her propensity 
to change her mind not just about her own role in this “social tapestry,” 
but about the entire nature of the thing itself. Lily’s simultaneous 
attraction and repulsion, not just from single men or situations, but to the 
entire situation of her life, expands the novel of manners into something 
resembling a psychodrama. 
Wharton is also very deliberate in creating a character who is entirely 
dependent on the money of these people to maintain her lifestyle, which 
is the only one she has ever known. Over and over again, Lily comes 
close to repudiating her cruel, petty friends before remembering that 
she also lives in terror of having to make a life for herself outside of this 
context. Usually she repudiates for just long enough to miss important 
chances — she spends an afternoon in the country with Lawrence 
Selden, a charming lawyer just outside the circle of “fashion,” and when 
she returns to the house finds that Percy Gryce has gotten upset and left. 
Money saturates the social system Wharton depicts — there’s a gift 
economy for “tips” on Wall Street, newly rich families try to display their 
wealth to each other in banquets and parties. Every act of consumption 
is conspicuous. This doesn’t mean that restrictive social codes no longer 
exist, though, it just means that they are overlaid with an intensely 
marketized logic. Money mixes with everything else. Lily falls into a 
debt in the first half of the book to an investor, Gus Trenor, which quickly 
turns into an implied sexual debt that Lily flees from in horror. Later, 
she receives a marriage offer from Simon Rosedale, a man she finds 
repellant, who says “I’m just giving you a plain business account of the 
consequences. You’re not very fond of me — yet — but you’re fond of 
luxury, and style, and amusement, and not having to worry about cash.” 
As time goes on Lily becomes more and more desperate, she finds this 
proposal more and more appealing, even as she shrinks from it. 
The cruelty of “The House Of Mirth” lies in its reduction of everything 
to value — every bit of social behavior, every signifying piece of clothing 
or jewelry has a vector that ties it to money. Wharton’s novel reveals, as 
Lily says, “the cords at the back of the social tapestry,” the identical image 
of society with all the material workings visible. 
Two
There’s something about the structure of indecision that makes 
caricatures of the objects under consideration. Writing indecision, then, 
often requires stating the patently ridiculous. The titular character 
of Adelle Waldman’s 2013 novel “The Love Affairs Of Nathaniel P” is 
performing a kind of lower-stakes version of Lily Bart’s social weighing; 
instead of two distinct, relatively fixed systems, Nate is evaluating 
a string of women for compatibility, never quite being able to settle 
on what he actually wants from them. He is instead afloat in a sea of 
atomized social and sexual characteristics that never quite settle into 
preferences or opinions. Essentially, he is of two minds as well — one 
desiring company and one seeing himself as akin to Mailer and Roth, 
the mid-century writers who were able to view their sexual gratification 
as akin to the fulfilment of their intellectual wills, independent of 
romantic involvement. He has inherited a lot of misogyny from his 
ambient encounters with masculinity, represented by his friend Jason 
who frequently regales Nate about his softer side. Nate frequently finds 
himself judging women on Jason’s metric of one to 10 before stopping 
himself. But he does have a genuine tender streak that occasionally and 
unpredictably finds its way to the surface. 
This pendulousness makes his behavior in relationships strange and 
erratic. He is not a jerk; he is in fact sensitive when he wants to be, but is 
still capable of being unfeeling and even cruel. He entertains moments 
of “embarrassing tenderness” and refers to the feeling of having a 
girlfriend as having an “an alien presence” in his bed with him. He is 
unable to face these contradictions, because it seems like his mind is 
only capable of entertaining one set of feelings at a time. Nate’s emotions 
are always described with fluid words — affection comes over him in “a 
wave,” resentment “flows” through him. Nothing can be pinned down 
or reversed in a wave, it has to be followed. Nate is at the mercy of his 
emotions, wherever they may lead him. 
The novel occasionally feels like it simplifies everything in life to 
writing and sex, but in that I feel like it represents how a sizable contingent 
of people in the contemporary era of overwork and individualism think. 
As much as his social life is tied up in his work, he sees work as completely 
distinct from the rest of his life, and is prone to seeing anything else as 
a distraction. Nate has a hard time having a dignified relationship 
with anyone because he sees, essentially, a dignified relationship as 
compromising his working ideal. This does not stop him from pursuing 
relationships, though. He is unable to fully settle on this ideal, unable to 
fully commit to it. 
Maybe this tug-of-war settles on a synthesis in the way that Nate tends 
to value women. No one in this book seems particularly intellectually 
rigorous, instead drawing from a hodgepodge of reference points to make 
ad-hoc arguments over drinks for the fun of it. Similarly, Nate judges 
women based on a bewildering array of overlapping social cues and 
codes, some of which have to do with writing and some of which have 
to do with simple attractiveness. He judges women the way a bad book 
reviewer judges a book, succinctly and based on surface characteristics 
— he’s giving a recommendation, more or less.

Pitch shifting has been around for decades. 
It’s the process of raising or lowering a vocal 
pitch signal by a set interval. Essentially, 
it makes the original signal sound higher 
or lower in pitch, depending on how the 
artist implements it. Chuck Berry adopted 
vocal pitch shifting during his late career to 
make his voice sound younger. Kanye West 
has used it prominently when sampling to 
create his trademark “chipmunk soul” beats. 
Grindcore and death metal bands use it to 
drop their vocals deeper below the human 
register and raise them to be higher than 
a screaming banshee. A$AP Rocky uses it 
extensively on the introductions to many of 
his tracks. It’s a wildly dynamic effect that 
has uses across genres, but for some reason, 
few musicians within the singer-songwriter 
sphere have implemented it. That is, until 
(Sandy) Alex G started making waves.
Alex G, who started as a bedroom 
musician recording tracks on his laptop 
with a shabby, decades old microphone, 
has become a veritable indie star, and he 
did it using vocal pitch shifting. He doesn’t 
overdo it, though. He only uses it when 
he thinks he needs it. Sometimes it’s for 
an entire song, sometimes it’s only on the 
verses and sometimes it’s just sprinkled in 
randomly. Alex G has gotten some pretty 
prominent placements because of it, too. He 
was the one playing guitar all over Frank 
Ocean’s Blonde and Endless. He’s worked 
with Oneohtrix Point Never, reimagining 
“Babylon” in a dazzling, yet somber, way. In 
fact, Alex G’s cover of “Babylon” has even 
more plays than the original. He has the 
ability to create haunting, magical moments 
using only his voice, and that’s a special 

thing to have.
His newest release House of Sugar is most 
similar to a cute but slightly creepy old 
fairy tale. It’s both captivating and a little 
repelling at the same time. Beginning with 
“Walk Away,” each song takes listeners to 
another realm, one where time stands still 
as Alex G’s vocals and guitar wash over 
everything. “Walk Away” is like the gentlest 
vice grip, with plush pillows taking the 
place of clamps. The song is stifling, but in a 
comforting way. The use of downward pitch 
shifting on the lines, “(S)omeday I’m gonna 
walk away from you / Not today, not today / 
Not today, not today / Not today, not today,” 
is unsettling and claustrophobic, but in a 
way, it feels nostalgic, like a memory that 
can suddenly speak to you, subtly reminding 
you of an old misstep. 
“Walk Away” is the introductory track 
to an album dealing with addiction and 
dependence, and it’s a damn good one at 
that. It beautifully sets listeners up for songs 
like “Hope,” a tear-inducing remembrance 
of a friend who died from an overdose 
on fentanyl, and “Taking,” a choric aside 
about a woman discovering and caressing 
her potentially strung-out lover. Despite 
thematic similarities, Alex G continues to 
surprise sonically. “Bad Man” is similar 
to a country ballad, and on “Sugar,” he 
unleashes a droning, robtronic wall of 
sound, making it clear that Oneohtrix Point 
Never’s influence has rubbed off on him.
The most striking thing about House 
of Sugar is its ability to strike a balance 
between the strange and the familiar. Alex G 
seamlessly incorporates altered and multi-
tracked vocals with electronic keys and 
acoustic guitar. He’s so good at arranging 
his songs that the electronic flare doesn’t 
seem that odd next to the more standard 
acoustic guitar. It just makes sense. That 
weirdness is what makes Alex G who he is, 

and he’s never ashamed to let his goofiness 
shine. Luckily, this doesn’t detract from 
his music and its message. Instead, it adds 
accessibility, cutting the weight off some of 
the heavier tracks.
House of Sugar is like a childhood fairy 
tale that slowly begins to reveal itself as 
you get older. At first, it seems sweet and 
innocent, but as you give it more time 
and thought, it begins to reveal its more 
sinister colors. In this case, it unveils the 
ravages of dependence and addiction in a 
truly sad way. But using pitch shifting and 
glittering instrumentals, the album appears 
saccharine and a bit silly. It is truly the 
culmination of Alex G’s career up to this 
point, perfectly capturing his essence as a 
musician and human being. House of Sugar 
is an album that deserves repeat listens, if 
not for its lyrical content, then for the sonic 
acrobatics it so often pulls.
(Sandy) Alex G has already proven that he 
can do the whole singer-songwriter thing. 
But it’s the moments on House of Sugar when 
he lets his freak fly that make the album 
special. Moments like when he busts out the 
Springsteen impression on “SugarHouse - 
Live” or his mock-country accent on “Bad 
Man” are what make it hard not to fall in 
love with the man and the music.

From 
an 
early 
age, 
we’ve 
been 
conditioned to see height not just as a 
genetic marker, but as a quality of identity. 
Growing up, we tracked our maturation 
with pencil marks on closet walls, in 
middle school we lined up in height order 
and beamed with pride upon reaching 
five feet and now as adults we still gossip 
over physical stature. Impossible to miss, 
height is naturally a feature considered 
in our first impressions of one another. 
While the intention behind Netflix’s latest 
release, “Tall Girl,” is more to offer a light-
hearted romantic comedy than to make 
a commentary on society’s fixation with 
height, the film is deeper than it appears, 
provoking audiences to recall the value in 
embracing their own skin and standing 
tall.
Jodi (Ava Michelle, “The Bold and the 
Beautiful”) is six foot one inch, a trait no 
one ever lets her forget. Despite support 
from her family and quirky best friend 
Dunkleman (Griffin Gluck, “Why Him?”), 
who is openly head over heels for Jodi, her 
insecurities weigh heavy. For Jodi, height 
is a curse, a bewitchment that singles her 
out and, even worse, makes the prospect of 
finding a dateable guy nearly impossible. 
Her luck seems to change however, when 
an uber tall, dreamboat foreign exchange 
student named Stig materializes out of the 
blue. Stig appears to be everything that 

Jodi has been longing for and more, but 
whether he is actually what she needs is 
another question entirely.
As the title suggests, the film’s plot is 
relatively simplistic, illustrating the trials 
and tribulations of a girl struggling to fit 
in. However, through a balance of B-grade 
jokes and silly supporting characters, the 
film holds audience attention. Given that 
there aren’t many exciting twists and 
turns, both Dunkleman and Jodi’s sister 
Harper (Sabrina Carpenter, “Horns”), 
a slightly air-headed pageant girl, help 
pump the life blood to the movie. The 
two characters function as Jodi’s support 
network in different ways, and each has an 
eccentricity that skirts the line between 
entertaining and annoying. 
Despite its lack of mystery, “Tall Girl” 
does pull viewers in through the shared 
experience of being an “other.” Jodi’s tall 
stature is an obvious characteristic that 
sets her apart from the bunch. But other 
characters in the film are “weird” in less 
evident ways. Dunkleman for instance, 
carries around a crate of books instead of 
using a backpack. And Harper is the latest 
of late bloomer, still struggling to close the 
yearbook and move on from her pageant 
days. The point that director Nzingha 
Stewart aims to make is that we all have 
elements, on a varying spectrum of 
visibility, that make us outliers. As cheesy 
and overemphasized as this message is, for 
some odd reason, we don’t mind hearing it 
just one more time.
“Tall Girl” embodies the phrase “‘what 

you see is what you get.’” There are no 
major shockers, and no defining moments, 
but there is development. Though not 
necessarily innovative or fresh, Jodi’s 
story is representative of the journey of 
self-acceptance that each and every person 
goes through. We might not all have been 
the “tall girl” in high school, but that 
doesn’t mean we don’t all have our own 
awkward oddities that we’ve had to learn 
to grow into. The ultimate goal of “Tall 
Girl” is not to leave viewers wide-eyed 
and mindblown, but rather to crack a few 
smiles and warm a few hearts.

‘Tall Girl’ is simple, but very sweet

Nick Eubanks felt chills when 
he heard the play-call. He 
knew it was one designed to 
free him over the middle, a 
play Michigan had practiced 
repeatedly in the lead-up to 
its Nov. 17, 2018 bout with 
Indiana. He lined up on the 
right side of the line, put his 
hand on the ground, heard the 
cadence and started flying as 
if carried by the wings of an 
angel.
He released up the field, 
darting up the seam through 
the Hoosiers’ defense. As 
Zach Gentry broke to the 
corner and the safety chased, 
Eubanks knew the rest was 
inevitable. It was a moment 
born of unspeakable tragedy 
and unthinkable resilience, 
and finally it was all his. His, 
and nobody else’s. Gone, if 
only for an instant, was the 
burdensome past. The end 
zone beckoned.
Eubanks caught a dart from 
Shea Patterson at the oppos-
ing 20. There was nothing but 
green grass in front, but his 
head jolted right, left and right 
again to be sure. It was the 
first touchdown of his career. 
Then he crossed the goal line, 

as the band played “The Vic-
tors” and the roar of 110,000-
plus washed over. 
He didn’t hear much, but he 
felt plenty.
He felt his head drop, the 
wave of emotion crashing 
down. He felt those chills 
crawl back up his spine. He 
felt his nine siblings, sprawled 
out across the country, with 
him. At his brother in-law’s 
house over 1,000 miles away, 
Nick’s father, Clayton, leapt 
from the couch and screamed. 
Nick felt that, too.
Mostly, though, he felt his 
mom.
“I just had my head down,” 
Eubanks recalled last Tues-
day afternoon, “and was just 
thinking, like, ‘After all I went 
through, especially battling 
injuries, battling doubts, 
battling myself.’ I had rough 
days in practice, messing up in 
practice, not being counted on. 
I just thought about all them 
times. It just hit me.” 
Then he looked up, pointed 
two fingers at the sky and 
addressed his mom with two 
words.
“Thank you.”

Cassandra Eubanks’ dream car 
was a Chevy Suburban. Nick 
hoped from a young age that 
she’d live to see him buy it for 

her.
As she was losing strength in 
the late 2000s, Nick slowly 
entering adolescence, he be-
gan to understand that dream 
wouldn’t come to fruition. 
Cassandra had been battling 
cervical cancer for nearly a 
decade, though Nick and his 
nine siblings didn’t know the 

extent until the bitter end. She 
fought it hard and meticulous-
ly, doing chemotherapy and 
radiation unbeknownst to her 
children. At first, the effort 
was to great effect. The can-
cer regressed; the Eubanks’ 
thought she was in the clear.
“And then it came back,” Clay-
ton said over the phone last 

week. “And, what? They say it 
comes back with a vengeance? 
It did.”
With the cancer spreading and 
Cassandra’s health declining, 
the doctors recommended am-
putating her leg. The doctors 
felt it was the most effective 
way to rid her of the tumor. 
Amid tribulations and con-
sternation, the family agreed it 
was the best course of action.
Clayton was headed to work 
when a doctor called to ex-
plain the recommendation. 
Harried by the news, he got a 
ticket for speeding through a 
school district on his way to 
the hospital.
“I always kept faith knowing 
that she would pull through, 
because she fought it all her 
life and ‘I’ll beat it,’ ” Nick re-
called. “It got to a point where 
she was losing her strength 
and stuff like that, and basical-
ly that was it for her.”
Cassandra, 51, died of 
post-surgical complications 
on Sept. 11, 2011. To this day, 
Clayton regrets the decision to 
attempt the surgery.
“I wish I’d never have did that, 
but she left it on me,” Clayton 
said. “... Because it was all for 
nothing, and I was kind of just 
mad, really. Like I said, it was 
all for nothing.”
Nick, 14 at the time, internal-

ized the emotions from that 
trauma. He was a reticent kid 
already, and the tragedy stayed 
clouded in an adolescent haze 
of confusion.
“He’s a shy person, man. He’s 
not talkative,” Clayton said. 
“He was sorta like me with 
that; he kept a lot of that 
inside. I know (my kids) cried 
and stuff, but he didn’t express 
a lot. And I tried to do my best 
talking with him and stuff, 
make him understand what 
their mother would want from 
them.”
Cassandra left her sec-
ond-youngest son with a part-
ing message, one Nick holds 
dear to his heart. 
“Before she passed away, I 
think two days before, I was 
in the room with her, and 
she was just like, ‘It’s going 
to be alright.’ ” Eubanks said. 
“That’s the only thing she 
kept telling me. ‘It’s going to 
be alright.’ And then, from 
that point on, through every 
adversity I’ve faced — being 
here, being hurt freshman and 
sophomore year — I just had 
that message in the back of my 
head. 
“It’s going to be alright. It’s 
going to be alright.”

That’s when Nick turned to 
football, which doubled as both a 
coping mechanism and a tribute. It 
was always Cassandra’s dream for 
Nick to make it big in football, even 
while, at the time, his focus largely 
centered around basketball. Nick 
dove into football head-on.
There 
were 
no 
guarantees, 
but his large frame and athletic 
gift made the transition a smooth 
one. He was a late-bloomer in 
recruiting, but as is often the case, 
word spread quickly once schools 
took notice. Alabama, Auburn 
and Florida all took interest. All 
Eubanks really wanted, though, 
was a sense of belonging and trust. 
At Michigan, he found both, and he 
knew it right away. To the public, 
the commitment mere days before 
National Signing Day came as a 
shock.
As he was leaving Ann Arbor, 
Nick called Clayton to break the 
news that he was committing.
“That was kinda quick,” Clayton 
said. 
“Yeah, man,” Nick replied. “It felt 
right at home.”
Morsels of Cassandra’s ethos 
constantly linger with Nick, both 
physical and metaphysical. Often 
they emerge in times of distress — a 
need to summon strength when his 
own is put to the test. Sometimes 
he’ll talk to her when he’s all alone, 
repeating things she used to say to 
him or do for him. Anything to push 
forward.
After he broke his forearm 
against Purdue early in the 2017 
season, ending a potential breakout 
season in September, Eubanks’ 
frustration quickly morphed into 
dread. He’d caught two passes, 
including a 41-yard catch down the 
seam, in the season-opener against 
Florida. That existent dread soon 
turned to self-reflection, then angst.
He started asking himself if 
he still wanted to play. Recalling 
that time, perhaps the most trying 
in his career, Eubanks conveys 
sincerity in his desire to quit. He 
spoke to friends and family about 
the possibility. He spoke with Tarik 
Black and Jake Butt, both of whom 
are close confidants and understand 
his background, about his concerns. 
“I 
kinda 
thought, 
‘This 
is 

something I don’t want to do 
anymore,’ ” Eubanks recalled. “I 
kind of had a thought of myself, like, 
‘This is not you talking. This is not 
the Nick you were before she left.’ I 
kinda got myself back with that.
“ ‘You don’t quit,’ that’s something 
she told me. You don’t just sit down. 
There’s obstacles in life that’s gonna 
beat you down to the point you 
don’t want to do it anymore or you 
think you can’t do it anymore. I just 
always had that message saying, 
‘You got this, man.’ ”
As Eubanks speaks, his voice 
remains 
steadfast, 
cracking 
occasionally to collect his emotions. 
This is not a tale he tells liberally. 
He makes clear that he does not 
intend to engender sympathy or 
pity. He has never told his coaches, 
Jim Harbaugh included, about his 
mother and he doesn’t know what 
they do or don’t know.
He and Harbaugh often sit 
together upstairs in Schembechler 
Hall, exchanging small talk over 
dinner. Harbaugh will ask about 
school or life. Sometimes he’ll 
tell Eubanks stories of previous 
tight ends he’s coached. Eubanks 
says it’s helped him grow as a 
player. Though Nick has never told 
Harbaugh directly, Clayton tipped 
him off to the family’s background 
early on — those conversations, in 
that context, doubling as a check-in.
Harbaugh often swaps texts 
with Clayton, spanning from check-
ins on his son to well-wishes for 
the team. The two have struck up 
an unusual kinship, “to the point 
where 
they’re 
becoming 
best 
friends,” Nick said.
The loss of Cassandra struck 
Clayton in a uniquely crushing way, 
and it’s evident in the way he speaks. 
He often refers to his children as 
“good kids” and that he did “the 
best that I could.” Cassandra, by all 
accounts, was the family’s unifier. 
When she passed, the book lost its 
spine.
“Nick, he’s a strong kid, man,” 
Clayton said. “They loved their 
mom. And she loved them. She 
loved them to death; they knew it. 
And they wanted to finish what 
they started, and I admire that. That 
kid came a long way. And I did the 
best that I could with him. I had to 
be Mom and Dad. We came through 
it together, really.”

But then, just as you seem to 
understand Clayton Eubanks, a 
flashbulb memory comes firing 
from the recesses of his past. He 
recounts, in excruciating detail, 
getting called into the office in 10th 
grade; being told his mother had 
passed away; running home, not 
waiting for a ride; walking up to the 
house, and being told cancer had 
taken her. 
Suddenly, the scale of his grief 
takes on new meaning. Suddenly, 
the ripple effects shower down — 
and the tragedies hold new weight.
It was all for nothing… like I said, 
it was all for nothing.
The totality of those losses, and 
the succession of the two, cannot 
possibly be quantified in Clayton’s 
or Nick’s lives. How does a father 
possibly handle raising his kids 
under the exact same pain he 
experienced? How can he look Nick 
in the eyes, and sincerely tell him it 
was going to be alright? 
That is, of course, not something 
Nick — at age 14 or 22 — can 
properly contextualize. Neither he, 
nor Clayton, can properly put into 
words the impact those experiences 
had on his upbringing, nor the rest 
of his siblings.
“It kinda sent me spiraling, 
really,” Clayton said. “I got out of 
control for a minute. Once I got past 
that, I met his mom. And eventually, 
we started having kids. Kids are 
nice.”
Eubanks chooses not to dwell on 
those complexities. He’s focused, 
for the time being, on making the 
most of his last season at Michigan, 
continually improving. To start the 
year, he’s shown hints of being an 
integral part of the new offense. 
Flashing a smile, he says he’s even 
hoping to get his dad up for a game 
from Florida, circling the Ohio State 
game as a distinct possibility.
“I carry her spirit with me,” he 
said, “just having a good spirit. Just 
having her in my ear, in my corner, 
being that person that’s here with 
me, even though she’s not.”
Then he flashes the inside of his 
left forearm, pointing to a tattoo 
bearing her name. He often looks 
down when he’s going through 
something. Maybe it’s after a rough 
practice. Perhaps another injury 
arises. The understanding is clear.
“She’s here with me.”

Wolverines add depth with grad transfers Jacob Hayhurst, Shane Switzer

When Josh Norris decided 
to leave for the NHL, Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson knew he was 
facing an uphill battle to find a 
replacement.
The 
recruiting 
cycle 
in 
hockey runs far in advance of 
when players actually show up 
on campus. Typically, players 
commit while still in high school, 
then go play at least two years of 
junior hockey before enrolling. 
When a player like Norris, who 
was drafted in the first round of 
the 2017 NHL Draft, makes his 
decision to leave in May, finding 
a replacement is challenging.
“A lot of time your recruiting 
is so far ahead in college hockey 
now, that there’s not going to 
be a player out there if Norris 
finally tells you he’s leaving, 
bang, you can just find a guy,” 
Pearson said Wednesday. “It’s 
usually very picked over by that 
point. Then you start looking 
like, ‘Well, OK, maybe there’s 
a (graduate) transfer who has 
decided later on (to leave).’ ”
As soon as Pearson knew 
Norris 
was 
leaning 
toward 
leaving Michigan, he and his 
coaching staff started checking 
the 
transfer 
portal on a daily 
basis. 
Graduate 
transfers 
have 
only 
recently 
become 
prominent 
in 
college 
hockey, 
and 
Pearson 
credits the portal 
with 
making 
transferring more 
accessible on both 
sides.
“This 
year, 
(the 
transfer 
portal) 
really 
ramped 
up,” 
Pearson said. “This past winter 
and spring it really took off. ... 
That really became a big deal. 
Obviously, we see a lot of grad 
transfers 
in 
college 
hockey 
now, more than we did the year 
before. There were a few the 
first year, and then this year it 
just seems like it’s taken off.”
In April, when Pearson knew 
Norris might be leaving, the 

transfer portal was the first 
place he checked to find a new 
addition. And 600 miles away, 
a prominent player had just 
entered his name in the portal 
— Jacob Hayhurst, Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute’s leading 
scorer from the 2018-19 season.
After three years at RPI, 
Hayhurst 
decided 
his 
best 
chance at playing for a national 
title laid elsewhere. Michigan 
was one of the first teams to 
reach out to Hayhurst, and his 
decision to join the Wolverines 
came shortly after.
“At RPI things weren’t going 
as planned, and we continuously 
didn’t put a team on the ice that 
had the best opportunity to 
win,” Hayhurst said. “I think 
here at Michigan, each and 
every year, they create a team 
that has an opportunity to win 
a national championship, and I 
want to be a part of one, so that’s 
why I’m here.
“When 
they 
called, 
I 
answered right away and could 
not have been happier.”
Pearson often says that they 
can’t replace Norris with just 
one player. But when looking for 
a player to fill the gap, Hayhurst 
was at the top of Pearson’s list 
because 
of 
his 
combination 
of 
offensive 
output, 
speed 
and 
game 
experience.
“When you’re 
unsure if you’re 
gonna 
lose 
a 
kid 
like 
Josh 
Norris, 
right 
away you’re just 
trying to see if 
there’s someone 
there that can 
come in,” Pearson said. “It’s less 
of a hit than maybe bringing in a 
young freshman who’s got a lot 
to learn still. You bring in a guy 
like Hayhurst, a senior, or a guy 
who’s played three years and 
has one year left and can come 
into your program, it’s more 
seamless. He can just come in 
and sort of hit it running.”
In addition to losing Norris 
up front, Michigan lost three 
experienced blueliners in Quinn 
Hughes, Joseph Cecconi and 

Nick Boka. Pearson once again 
turned to the transfer portal 
in hopes of filling the void. 
There he found former Boston 
University defenseman Shane 
Switzer. After four years at BU, 
Switzer was looking for a school 
with more ice time available 
than he had with the Terriers.
“His name came up to us 
through the former coach there, 
David Quinn,” Pearson said. 
“We know David really well and 
he’s with the New York Rangers 
now. He had Switzer (at BU) so 
we had some conversations. He 
really liked Shane and it just — 
new coaches went into BU and it 
just wasn’t a good fit for Shane 
at that point. Brought in some 
really high-profile players, and 
he just sort of got squeezed out 
there. He’s a Michigan kid, was 
going to graduate early, a year 
early, so it’s just a good fit.”
Both Switzer and Hayhurst 
have 
seemingly 
settled 
in 
seamlessly with the Wolverines. 
After the team’s first practice, 
Pearson praised both for their 
on-ice abilities. And off the ice, 

the two new additions were 
quick to voice appreciation for 
their new teammates’ efforts in 
helping them get settled.
“It’s really easy, honestly,” 
Switzer said. “It’s a tight-
knit group in there, but they 
welcomed me with open arms 
and 
my 
roommates 
have 
been really helpful with the 
transition.”
Added 
Hayhurst: 
“It’s 
been great. The guys have 
been 
really 
helpful, 
caring, 
respectful and kind of showing 
me the ropes and everything, 
because it’s obviously different 
here than RPI, being at such 
a 
bigger 
school. 
Especially 
my roommates, they’ve really 
helped 
me 
out 
in 
getting 
prepared for classes and set up 
in that aspect.”
Replacing 
Norris 
and 
a 
veteran core on the blueline 
isn’t easy, but with Hayhurst’s 
offensive 
track 
record 
and 
Switzer’s 
ability 
as 
a 
defenseman, the two graduate 
transfers have the potential to 
fill in just fine.

Wolverines draw Nebraska-Omaha

Eight minutes in, disaster 
struck 
for 
the 
Wolverines. 
They’d fight. They’d keep their 
composure. But they’d never 
recover. 
In that pivotal eighth minute 
of the Michigan men’s soccer 
team’s match at University 
of 
Nebraska-Omaha 
Friday, 
Maverick 
forward 
Aaron 
Uribe hit a header over senior 
goalkeeper 
Andrew 
Verdi. 
The shot set the Wolverines 
back a goal early, gave Omaha 
momentum 
and 
furthered 
a 
tense 
environment 
for 
Michigan in their first road 
game of the season. 
The Wolverines dominated 
the 
Maverick 
throughout 
the rest of the match — in 
possession, in shots on goal, 
in corner kicks and in general 
flow of play. But that control 
didn’t translate to goals, and 
the Wolverines (2-2-1) drew 
Omaha (0-3-2), 1-1, in a gritty 
battle that ended with two 
overtime periods. 
“We need to do a little bit on 
game management and giving 

our team a chance to win and 
not have to chase the game so 
early,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “It’s not good to 
be down.”
From the first whistle, the 
Wolverines led Omaha in shots 
on goal — ultimately taking 25 
to the Maverick’s nine. The gap 
between shots on goal and the 
score indicates issues closing 
out opportunities in the final 
third 
of 
the 
field. 
“I don’t think 
we were at our 
best,” 
Daley 
said. “We had 
some good stuff 
from 
time 
to 
time throughout 
the game, but 
we 
carried 
possession 
to 
a 
ridiculous 
amount and carried chances, so 
I was a little disappointed one 
wouldn’t sneak in for us.” 
But only one did. In the 74th 
minute, senior forward Jack 
Hallahan beat a defender on the 
right wing and served a cross in 
the penalty box to sophomore 
forward Derick Broche, who 

headed the ball into the net. 
The game-tying goal came 
in the midst of a chippy game, 
with yellow cards plauging 
each roster — including four for 
the Wolverines. 
In the 72nd minute, an 
Maverick 
player 
fouled 
a 
Wolverine, and multiple other 
players stepped to his defense. 
To ease tensions, the referee 
issued yellow cards to players 
on both teams. 
But 
Daley 
insists 
the 
physicality 
of 
the 
game 
was 
typical. 
In 
fact, 
he 
says, it showed 
Michigan’s 
frustration with 
their plethora of 
missed chances. 
 
“It 
was 
just both teams competing,” 
Daley said. “The guys were 
just looking after each other. 
With the amount of possession 
we 
had, 
it 
was 
definitely 
unfortunate, but we’ll get back 
to the drawing board, get some 
recovery and get ready for 
Tuesday.”

Beall solid as Michigan fells WSU

Being a goalkeeper is one of the 
most high-pressure jobs in sports. 
Nothing between the player 
and the net –just a pair of gloves 
between the player and a soccer 
ball hurtling forward, often at 
upwards of 50 miles an hour. An 
intimidating task, to say the least.
Not so for Hillary Beall on 
Friday.
The junior goaltender was 
steady as a rock between the posts 
Friday, anchoring the Michigan 
women’s soccer team on its way to 
a 2-1 defeat of No. 13 Washington 
State. The win over the Cougars 
marks 
the 
Wolverines’ 
first 
against a ranked opponent this 
season, an encouraging sign as 
the team heads into Big Ten play 
Thursday.
“Hillary really just came up big 
for us,” Michigan coach Jennifer 
Klein said. “She’s been solid all 
throughout the season, and she’s 
been coming up with some big 
saves.
“I think it all comes down to 
her training and her experience 
as a goalkeeper, and she’s done 
a great job for us more than 
anything.”

The Wolverines got off to 
a quick start, scoring twice in 
the first four minutes. The first 
goal came off the foot of junior 
midfielder Sarah Stratigakis, who 
lifted the ball over the head of 
Washington State goalkeeper Ella 
Dederick in the second minute to 
put Michigan on the board.
The Wolverines were quick 
to strike again. In the 4th 
minute, sophomore midfielder 
Meredith Haakenson found the 
goal on a cross 
from 
junior 
midfielder Nicki 
Hernandez, 
faking left to 
beat 
Dederick 
before 
putting 
the ball in the 
net, 
extending 
Michigan’s lead 
to 2-0. 
“We just had 
great 
energy 
to start the game,” Klein said. 
“Really, it was just being prepared 
for their directness and how they 
move the ball.”
The match was fairly evenly-
paced throughout. Though the 
Wolverines finished the game 
on top, the Cougars had more 
shots, notching 12 on the match 

to Michigan’s eight. Washington 
State continued to threaten late 
into the game, finally beating 
Beall in the 71st minute on a 
header just past her outstretched 
fingertips to get on the board. 
The Wolverines held steady, 
though, with Beall lights out in 
the net for the rest of the night. 
She recorded 12 saves on the 
match, a career best for the junior, 
a native of Laguna Beach, Calif. 
The 
hours-long 
trip 
to 
Pullman, 
Wash. 
for the game – and 
the 
three-hour 
time 
difference 
from Ann Arbor 
– proved to be 
no 
problem 
for 
Michigan, which 
benefited 
greatly 
from its training 
leading up to the 
game.
“I thought we 
did a great job of finishing the 
game strong and finding a way 
to get a result on the road against 
a very dangerous and difficult 
opponent,” Klein said. “I thought 
the team did a great job handling 
the travel. I don’t think it really 
affected us.”
It certainly didn’t affect Beall.

Anna Spieker has mastered 
staying 
collected 
under 
pressure. 
As the clock began to count 
down in regulation on Friday, 
the sophomore goalkeeper saved 
a shot from No. 3 Connecticut’s 
senior forward Seva Boker. 
During the block a Michigan 
defender fouled resulting in 
a corner penalty — putting 
Spieker and the Wolverines’ 
defense to the test. 
A series of consecutive corner 
penalties ensued as the No. 11 
Michigan women’s field hockey 
team attempted to fend off the 
Huskies at the start of the fourth 
quarter (2-1).
“We talk about it a lot before 
the game,” Spieker said. “We 
have a specific kind of defensive 
structure going into the corner, 
so we study them. We know 
exactly who’s going to shoot. We 
anticipate what they’re going to 
do.” 
Connecticut took its shot, 
and the Wolverines blocked 
it. Yet, this block came strings 
attached, tying it to another 
corner penalty for the Huskies. 

“It’s 
always 
a 
stressful 
situation,” said Spieker. “But, 
I have full confidence in our 
corner defense.”
Connecticut again aimed for 
the goal and again fell short. 
Spieker, calm and collected, 
saved the shot. Though, in 
mirroring 
the 
first 
corner 
penalty’s play, the Wolverines 
allowed the Huskies another 
consecutive 
corner penalty. 
“Anna’s 
an 
experienced 
player, 
and 
she’s 
smart 
and 
poised,” 
said Michigan 
coach 
Marcia 
Pankratz. “We 
have enormous 
confidence 
in 
her being back 
there. We trust her.” 
Despite this faith in Spieker, 
tensions in the stadium built 
with each corner penalty, as the 
probability of an impending goal 
increased. 
For 
the 
third 
time, 
Connecticut readied itself to 
score, as the Wolverines again 
prepared their defense. The 
Huskies’ senior back Antonia 

Tiedtke 
carefully 
took 
her 
third shot. Spieker, living up to 
the trust placed in her, saved 
it. Connecticut collected the 
rebound quickly and impulsively 
took another shot at Spieker — 
missing wide. 
“I am confident, but I do get 
nervous and jittery,” Spieker 
said. “I just try to flush it out and 
be confident in what I can do.” 
This 
calm 
and 
collected 
attitude 
under 
pressure coupled 
with 
careful 
preparation 
gives 
Spieker 
her mastery over 
corner penalties, 
a 
game-winning 
skill for Michigan 
on Friday night. 
The 
Wolverines 
prevented the Huskies from 
scoring 
a 
goal 
that 
would 
have ultimately tied the game. 
Michigan won 3-2. 
“I thought Anna played quite 
well today,” Pankratz said. “Our 
team’s defense was solid and 
organized.
“I just couldn’t be more proud 
of our team and how hard we’ve 
played defensively.”

Anna Spieker and the No. 
11 Michigan defense were in a 
tough spot.
With 13 minutes remaining 
and a one-goal lead on Friday, 
the 
sophomore 
goalkeeper 
faced three consecutive penalty 
corner attempts from No. 3 
Connecticut 
(4-1). 
Spieker 
stayed focused, making two 
more saves to preserve the 
Wolverines’ lead, en route to a 
3-2 victory over the Huskies.
“Anna’s 
an 
experienced 
player,” said Michigan coach 
Marcia Pankratz. “We have 
enormous confidence in her 
being back there.”
Added Spieker: “It’s always a 
stressful situation going into it 
but I have full confidence in our 
corner defense that we’re going 
to do well.”
The Wolverines (3-2) opened 
the scoring five minutes into 
the second quarter. After a shot 
by sophomore midfielder Sofia 
Southam was saved, Michigan 
was awarded a penalty corner. 
Southam received the pass off 
of the corner and took a shot, 
which was deflected in by 
senior midfielder/forward Fay 
Keijer for her first goal of the 

season. The Wolverines tacked 
on another goal with 1:30 left 
in the half on junior midfielder 
Kayla Reed’s second goal of the 
season.
Halfway through the third 
quarter, Connecticut cut the 
lead to 2-1 with a top-shelf goal 
out of Spieker’s reach, giving 
the Huskies some momentum. 
They got another prime scoring 
chance with time expiring in the 
third. A high shot forced Spieker 
to make an impressive save, 
deflecting the shot and kicking 
it out from in front of the net.
After keeping Connecticut 
scoreless 
on 
the 
three 
consecutive 
corners, 
the 
Wolverines 
regained 
momentum and played well 
defensively, leading to more 
scoring opportunities. With just 
under five minutes left in the 
game, freshman forward Sarah 
Pyrtek took a one-timer off of 
a rebound and potted a much 
needed insurance goal, giving 
Michigan a 3-1 lead.
With a two-goal lead, the 
Wolverines 
played 
a 
more 
defensive-minded game. The 
Huskies had difficulty breaking 
through for a while, but in the 
last minute a cross got past 
Spieker, allowing an unmarked 
Connecticut player to score an 

easy goal.
“Unfortunate goal,” Spieker 
said. “We should’ve been there 
defensively probably a little 
better. That goal needs to be 
marked.”
Despite the goal, Michigan 
continued its strong defensive 
play 
when 
the 
Huskies 
threatened as time expired, 
giving them no space to get 
a shot off. The win gave the 
Wolverines their best win of 
the young 2019 season and 
a 
confidence 
booster 
going 
forward.
“I’m very excited about the 
win,” Pankratz said. “UConn 
is an excellent team and I just 
couldn’t be more proud of our 
team and how hard we’ve played 
defensively. 
“Even though we’ve had a 
couple of losses early we just 
keep instilling that it’s a process 
and we’re trying to get better 
every day. We’re just trying to 
instill confidence in all of the 
players. I thought they played 
with that today beautifully.”
With Spieker and the rest of 
the Michigan’s defense playing 
at this caliber, the team looks 
poised to take the confidence 
that it gained from this game 
into the fast-approaching Big 
Ten season.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

After 
losing 
two 
of 
its 
last three games, the No. 24 
Michigan volleyball team (6-2) 
looked to right the ship on Friday 
against Navy (4-4), a feat it 
would accomplish after battling 
through three close sets.
From the outset, things didn’t 
look good for the Wolverines.
Michigan was down 11-8 early 
against the Midshipmen in the 
first set. Looking to get his team 
back on track, Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen called a timeout. 
Coming out of the huddle, the 
Wolverines 
outscored 
Navy, 
17-11, en route to a 25-22 victory 
in the first set. They would go on 
to win the next two sets 25-22 
and 25-21 to earn a 3-0 sweep.
Despite earning a sweep, 
Rosen believes that the win left 
much room for improvement. 
“I don’t think we played to the 
level of our ability, so for me, it’s 
hard to look and say we pulled 
these out,” Rosen said. I think it 
never should’ve been that close. 
For me, I think we can execute 
better and represent better.”
While the team looked far 
more disciplined and effective 
after Rosen’s timeout, he insists 
that he had little to say in the 
huddle. Instead, he used the 
break simply as a chance to let 
his squad regroup. Clearly, the 
strategy worked.
“(I was) just giving them a 
chance to regroup and take 
a step back and juts take that 
time to re-gather themselves,” 
Rosen said. “I thought that they 
responded well.”
In 
the 
second 
set, 
the 
Wolverines came out swinging, 
quickly jumping out to an 8-3 
lead — highlighted by an ace 
from freshman middle blocker 
May Pertofsky — and forcing a 
Midshipmen timeout.
Errors, though, proved to be 
a problem, with the Wolverines 
committing three in the set to 

allow Navy to tie the score at 11.
Overcoming these mistakes, 
the Wolverines netted three 
straight kills to push the lead to 
14-11. They then held off a late 
push from the Midshipmen after 
a block from senior outside hitter 
Sydney Wetterstrom and a Navy 
service error, taking the second 
set, 25-22.
Despite the team’s errors, 
Michigan found a steady anchor 
on offense in senior setter 
Mackenzi Welsh, who totaled 
10 assists in the set and 35 total 
on the night. Rosen credited her 
for helping the team’s offense 
stabilize itself late in the set.
“She’s somebody who’s really 
experienced,” he said. “There’s 
a reason she’s our floor captain.”
With a chance to sweep, 
Michigan eventually clinched a 
25-21 victory thanks to six kills 

from sophomore outside hitter 
Paige Jones. The final blow came 
on a spike from freshman middle 
blocker Jess Robinson, who had 
11 kills on the night, including 
four in the final set.
“She doesn’t really bounce 
balls straight down very often,” 
Rosen said, “but she hits so hard 
and so high and with really good 
range that she just gets a lot of 
kills.”
One thing is certain: Friday’s 
win 
didn’t 
come 
without 
problems, as Rosen will be the 
first to tell you.
“I thought today we were 
very up and down,” he said. “We 
certainly are striving to be a 
more steady team than that, but 
right now that’s all I can go of is 
what I see and that’s where we 
were and we’ve gotta work on 
that.” 

Deep into the third set, 
freshman defensive specialist 
Amber Beals lofted the ball in 
the air and smacked it to the 
opposing side of the court. 
The ball ricocheted off the 
defender’s arm, notching the 
fourth service ace of the day 
for the Wolverines.
But it wasn’t just more 
aggressive serving that allowed 
the No. 24 Michigan volleyball 
team (6-2) to overtake Eastern 
Michigan 
(3-5) 
in 
three 
straight sets on Sunday — 
adjustments in all aspects of 
the game, particularly weak 
serves, revealed a constantly 
adapting Wolverine team. It 
showed a group who knows its 
strengths and weaknesses and 
knows how to adjust.
The first set of the day was 
a tit-for-tat slugfest that put 
Michigan on its heels. With 
several 
lead 
changes 
and 
errors, the Wolverines found 
their way out of the first frame 
with a three-point win. A few 
serves found the net instead 
of the floor and certain passes 
ran errant while Michigan 
attempted to establish itself.

In part, the Eagles’ unique 
system — characterized by 
running high balls to the 
outside, 
tricking 
blockers 
into 
earlier, slower 
attempts 
at 
the 
ball 
— 
attributed 
to 
the 
Wolverines’ 
early 
struggles.
But 
after 
that first set, 
having 
seen 
the 
opposing 
system, 
the 
more 
talented 
Michigan team took the lead 
and never looked back.
Serving became an asset 
rather than a liability. The 
blocking became crisp and 
dominant. Other players saw 
the floor and made immediate 
contributions.
While not all serves landed 
as aces, many were superbly 
placed, often forcing the setter 
to run all over the floor and 
play out of system.
“Aces are good, but we look 
at aces as a nice thing, but more, 
it’s what’s happening on all the 
balls,” said Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen. “Is the setter 

standing at the net where she 
wants to stand, running her 
offense where she wants to 
run it from? Or is she on the 
run and moving off the net? 
If our serving is tough enough 
where we’ve got their setter on 
the run, then hey, that’s not as 
good as an ace, but it’s awfully 
close.”
Making proper adjustments 
is a running theme for the 
Wolverines this year, with 
Sunday’s win cementing that 
idea. 
Earlier 
in 
the 
match, 
senior outside hitter Sydney 
Wetterstrom struggled. The 
offensive workhorse’s typical 
ferocity was missing, often 
whiffing 
on 
routine 
spike 
plays. So Rosen pulled his 
starter out of the rotation to 
let Wetterstrom see the game 
from a different perspective. 
After 
the 
needed 
mental 
break, she went back in and 
dominated — finishing the day 
with 11 kills. 
A testament to the team’s 
depth 
and 
mindset, the case 
of 
Wetterstrom 
is 
a 
frequent 
occurrence 
for 
Michigan 
this 
year. 
“Sometimes 
you just need a 
break,” 
Rosen 
said. 
“And 
we 
have the depth 
to be able to do 
that, so I thought across the 
board today, people who went 
in, they were ready to go in, 
and the level stayed high.”
Now, the team is looking 
to reconcile this idea with its 
record. After dropping two 
games to unranked opponents 
Missouri and Dayton at the 
Dayton 
Invitational, 
the 
Wolverines will look to shake 
early errors and focus on their 
advantages. 
While anyone can look at 
a straight-set win and see 
a 
dominant 
performance, 
Michigan’s 
strength 
comes 
in acknowledging the early 
challenges — then adjusting to 
roll over the competition.

Michigan sweeps Navy on Friday, Eastern Michigan on Sunday in show of dominance as Big Ten play gets closer

Jones breakout lifts Wolverines

After an underwhelming start 
to a season in which she figured 
to be the Michigan volleyball 
team’s top offensive weapon, 
Paige Jones put a dent in any 
notion of a sophomore slump on 
Friday night.
In her best performance of the 
young season, the sophomore 
outside hitter posted 12 kills on 29 
swings to propel the 24th-ranked 
Wolverines to a sweep of Navy 
(4-4).
Despite 
a 
lackluster 
.152 
hitting percentage — a 43-point 
dropoff from last season’s clip 
— Michigan (6-2) continued to 
rely on Jones to carry a large 
portion of the offense through its 
first seven matches. She entered 
Friday with more attack attempts 
than any other Wolverine except 
senior outside hitter Sydney 
Wetterstrom.
Coming off an appearance 
on the Big Ten All-Freshman 
Team in 2018, little stood in 
Jones’ way of 
becoming one of 
the conference’s 
best pin hitters. 
That 
is, 
aside 
from herself.
Through 
Michigan’s first 
six matches of 
the season, Jones 
committed 
a 
team-high 
29 errors and 
recorded a hitting percentage 
above .250 only once. Talent 
has never been a question with 
Jones — the Ohio high school 
state record holder for kills in a 
single match and season — but 
errors have cost her a chance at 
dominance.
While it’s already tough for 
an outside hitter to produce 
when they’re at the top of every 
opposing scouting report, self-
inflicted 
errors 
are 
costly. 
Freshmen in particular often find 
themselves prone to mistakes, 
and Jones was no different a 
season ago when she averaged 
over 1.5 attack errors per set. 
This season’s figure was hovering 
around a similar mark before she 

made just two errors on Friday 
while posting a season-best .345 
hitting percentage.
Wolverines’ 
coach 
Mark 
Rosen subbed her out in favor of 
sophomore Abbey Malinowski 
after just six points, citing Jones’ 
diversion from the game plan. 
Jones didn’t sit on the bench for 
long, and she made her presence 
felt upon returning. She tallied 
a team-best four kills on seven 
errorless 
swings 
even 
after 
stumbling out of the gate.
“When (Jones) went back in, 
she really dialed it in,” Rosen 
said. “That’s a great skill. We’re 
not always going to have our best 
night on any given night but the 
ability to in-match alter where 
you’re at and get it under control, 
Paige has done that numerous 
times. Give her a breather, (then) 
she comes back in and does a 
really nice job.”
Two of her four kills came at 
key moments late in the frame, 
breaking a tie at 18 and giving 
Michigan a three-point lead 
at 22-19. Her timely front row 
execution wasn’t 
the 
only 
place 
she left her mark, 
though, as her 
serve kept Navy 
out 
of 
system 
for most of the 
match. Jones is 
the team’s only 
starter 
with 
a 
jump serve — a 
technique 
used 
to 
add 
power 
and height to the move by using 
a leaping approach to strike the 
ball.
Her 12-to-14 ace-to-error ratio 
is a big step forward from her 
39-to-70 mark as a freshman and, 
so far, has made the difference in 
some tight sets.
“I’m trying right now to just 
tell myself to go out and have fun 
and play,” Jones said on Sunday 
after recording 15 kills in a sweep 
of Eastern Michigan. “When I 
think about stuff too much is 
when I struggle a little bit, but my 
teammates definitely help me and 
help me feel more comfortable on 
the court to be able to go out and 
play volleyball and have fun.”
Emerging when her team 

needs her most is something 
Jones is working to embrace now 
that she has a year of experience 
under her belt. She was the 
team’s lone freshman in the 
starting lineup last season — an 
opportunity that allowed her 
to learn on the fly as the season 
progressed. 
But for Jones, such experience 
brings 
the 
added 
pressure 
of knowing nothing is new 
anymore.
“She 
has 
really 
high 
expectations for herself,” Rosen 
said. “She’s a perfectionist, as 
most of our players are. She puts a 
lot of pressure on herself, has a lot 
of expectations and sometimes 
needs to be able to take a step 
back. My advice I have for her is 
to just play the game. … As she 
gets more comfortable doing 
that, we’re going to see some 
really great things from her.”
Jones put forth her season-
best performance in kills-per-set, 
attack efficiency and blocking in 
Friday’s sweep. Now, it becomes 
a matter of making such a 
performance the status quo.
“She can be really, really 
good,” Rosen said. “… I think she 
can do that on a regular basis and 
certainly that’s our expectation, 
but we’ve got to get her there.”

The Wolverines were on the 
ropes. 
Midway through the second 
set, Michigan volleyball coach 
Mark Rosen called a timeout. 
His team trailed by a point after 
scoring only one of the previous 
seven. Eastern Michigan was 
rolling.
But Rosen rallied his team, 
and the Wolverines (6-2) took 
the next three points. They 
never looked back en route to 
a 25-22, 25-18, 25-19 victory. 
Despite 
dominating 
just 
moments before, the Eagles 
(3-5) completely fell apart after 
Rosen’s timeout and never led 
again. 
“(Before the timeout,) we 
were just making a lot of errors,” 

Rosen said. “… We just want to 
make sure we can play our game 
and don’t give them free points, 
and I thought they did a really 
good job after that, and then the 
game flipped.” 
The first set was a largely 
back-and-forth 
affair 
early 
on, with neither team leading 
by more than one through 
the first 13 points. The Eagles 
managed to grind out a 12-8 
lead, their largest of the match, 
but 
Michigan 
battled 
back 
to even the score at 17. From 
there, crucial kills — especially 
from sophomore outside hitter 
Paige Jones — propelled the 
Wolverines to their first set win. 
“They’re a very different 
tempo than we are,” Rosen said. 
“… it just took them awhile to 
get used to the rhythm, and 
once they did, our block got a lot 

better and then our defense got 
a lot better after that.”
Using 
these 
defensive 
adjustments, 
the 
Wolverines 
maintained their rhythm early 
in the second set, opening 
with 
two 
consecutive 
kills 
from 
freshman 
opposite 
hitter May Pertofsky. Jones 
and 
senior 
outside 
hitter 
Sydney Wetterstrom anchored 
Michigan’s 
offensive 
attack, 
notching four kills each in the 
second set. Wetterstrom would 
finish the match with 11 kills, 
including a textbook spike to 
clinch the second set for the 
Wolverines. 
Jones 
finished 
with a team-leading 15 kills, a 
sensational number in a match 
that finished in just three sets. 
“I’m trying right now to tell 
myself to just go out there and 
have fun and play,” Jones said. 
“When I think about stuff too 
much is when I struggle a little 
bit, but my teammates definitely 
help me feel more comfortable 
on the court to be able to go out 
and play volleyball and have 
fun.”
Michigan 
dominated 
the 
third set, jumping to an early 8-3 
lead and riding that momentum 
through the end of the match. 
The offense largely ran through 
senior setter Mackenzi Welsh, 
who tallied 15 assists in the 
third set and a whopping 42 for 
the whole match. 
“Mack is doing a great job 
being 
floor 
captain,” 
Jones 
said. “She’s the one that really 
makes sure that when we go 
into the huddle, we all make eye 
contact.” 
The production didn’t stop 
there. Junior libero Natalie 
Smith added a team-leading 12 
digs, and Jones and Welsh added 
11 and 10 digs, respectively. 
“Our passing, our first contact 
was really good tonight, and 
that’s something we’ve been 
spending a lot of time working 
on,” Rosen said. “Overall, I 
think we did a really good job.”
