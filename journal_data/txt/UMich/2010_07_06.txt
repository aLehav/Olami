Postgraduate classes to
no longer be paid for by
commercial groups
By SUZANNE JACOBS
DailyStaffReporter
Beginning next January, the Uni-
versity's medical school will no lon-
ger accept commercial funding for its
postgraduate education classes.
The decision - recommended
by the Medical School's Conflict of
Interest Group - is part of a broader
nationwide debate over whether phar-
maceutical and device companies
ought to have a hand in paying for
medical education classes.
Continuing medicaleducation,
or CME, activities provide medi-
cal professionals an opportunity to
learn about advances in medicine
and health care. In many states, CME
participation is required for doctors
to maintain their licenses to practice
medicine.
The Accreditation Council for
Continuing Medi Education regu-
lates CME across the United States
and has strict policies in place to
ensure that classes are free from
commercial influence, including fill
disclosure and management of .y
conflicts of interest of an individual
"who is in the position to control t'
content of an education activity."
According to a 2008 report frorr

Texting while
drlivling banned

Statewide law makes
texting on the road a
primary offense
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily StaffReporter
Billboards have begun to line the
highways across the state informing
drivers and passengers of a new state_
law - which went into effect on Jun.
30 - prohibiting reading, writing or
sending text messages on a cell phone
while driving.
Democratic Gov. Jennifer Gran-
holm signed the legislation on The
Oprah Winfrey Show on Apr. 30,
making Michigan one of 28 states to
ban text messaging while driving in
an attempt to make the roads safer for
fellow drivers and pedestrians alike.
The legislation states that if the
vehicle is not moving, like at a stop
sign, drivers can still text on their
cell phones. The law also excuses text
messages sent by drivers to report an
emergency or a crime.

Under the new Michigan law,
texting while driving is a primary
offense. While violators will not
receive any points on their driver's
license, first-time offenders will be
issued a $100 fine and repeat offend-
ers will face a $200 fine.
State Sen. Liz Brater (D-Ann
Arbor) said she supports the texting
ban based on the significant amount
of evidence suggesting that it's dan-
gerous to send text messages while
driving.
Paul Green, a research professor at
the University of Michigan's Trans-
portation Research Institute, wrote
in an e-mail interview with The
Michigan Daily that scientific data
reveals an increased chance for acci-
dents to occur when a driver is text
messaging while on the road.
"The risk ratio for a crash (is)
about 14 times normal in one study,
with other studies showing similar
values," Green wrote.
Green wrote that the risk ratio is
increased while texting because it
forces drivers to look away from the
road for significant periods of time,

and it's difficult to steer when typing
a message.
Green added that while it doesn't
necessarily mean that everyone will
have an accident while texting and
driving, but the risk is increased.
Ann Arbor City Council Member
Christopher Taylor (D-Ward 3) said
the ban will make the roads safer for
everyone, adding that he believes the
texting ban will be most effective
after it receives sufficient publicity,
especially since the legislation is gen-
erally accepted as a safety precaution.
Green, on the other hand, said he
believes the texting ban's success
depends on the level at which police
officers enforce it.
"Its effectiveness depends on
enforcement and the extent to which
not texting becomes the accepted
social norm, just as wearing a seat
belt is now accepted," he said.
Lt. Renee Bush of the Ann Arbor
Police Department said time will
tell if the law is going to be hard to
enforce, but said she believes people
are generally concerned about safety
and will recognize that the law is
there to protect them.
Bush said police will be looking
for drivers who are visibly typing on
a cell phone or looking down while
driving, and added that there will not
be any discrimination based on age,
and the police anticipate encounter-
ing violators of all ages and genera-
tions.
Bush added that the AAPD's main
concern is not writing tickets, but
all these other teams," he said.
Kumar, who led the team during the
race, added that the University of Min-
nesota - the runner-up team in the
ASC this year - ran a very aggressive
race but appeared to run out of energy
in trying to keep up with the Univer-
sity of Michigan's solar car.
"We were able to work as a team
much better than anybody else and
that is what ultimately gained us the
victory," he said.
Kumar said many of the senior
members who raced in the 2009 World
Solar Challenge graduated, posing
another challenge for the team to over-
come.
"The biggest challenge was getting
them trained in the art of racing a solar
car," he said. "Given these conditions,
what I think gave us the win was the
rigorous amount of testing we did as
soon as school ended."
The 2010 ASC also underwent sev-
eral changes from previous years, the
most significant being the race route.
LSA junior Rachel Kramer, the Solar
Car Team's project manager, said the
route was cut in half compared to pre-
vious years.
Despite changes in regulation and
the team's route, Kumar said they ran
into only one issue during the race.

instead keeping the roads safe by
discouraging drivers from being
distracted as they are when texting
while driving.
LSA sophomore Natalie Christian
said she supports the ban given the
possibility for text messaging to dis-
tract drivers from the road.
"Even though you may think it's
not affecting your driving skills, any-
thing can happen in a matter of sec-
onds," Christian said. "That's all it
takes. I definitely see the ban having
a positive impact."
LSA sophomore Nicole Allen
echoed Christian's sentiment, saying
she believes drivers should put down
their phones and pay attention to the
task at hand.
"People are way too plugged in
nowadays, and we need to relearn
how to focus on things like driving,
which seems mundane to us even
though one second of distraction on
the road can change our lives forev-
er," Allen said.
LSA senior Kortni Malone said she
agrees that texting is a distraction
while driving and can have devastat-
ing effects.
"There are so many things that
can happen in the blink of an eye,"
Malone said. "It takes a text message
longer than that to travel across car-
riers, but one wrong move can end a
life. I'm sure that text can wait."
According to Bush, no fines had
been issued by the Ann Arbor Police
Department as of Friday Jul. 2 at
noon.
"It was drizzling a bit and the water
shorted one of our circuits so we spent
about fifteen minutes on the side of the
road trying to figure out the problem
and debug the problem," Kumar said,
"But even then we were going so fast
(that) we still managed to finish that
stage in first place."
With another American Solar Chal-
lenge win under their belts, members
of the Solar Car Team have begun
planning on their next goal: winning
the World Solar Challenge. The team
came in third place in the internation-
al competition last year and in seventh
place the previous year.

ous solar car models, has been retired

Solar Car Team
wins American
Solar Challenge

University student
team takes trophy for
the sixth time
By TOREHAN SHARMAN
For the Daily
With their third consecutive win at
the 2010 American Solar Challenge on
Jun. 26, members of the University's
Solar Car Team have already begun to
set their sights ona similar result at the
2011 World Solar Challenge in Austra-
lia.
The Infinium - the team's current
car - crossed the finish line more than
two hours ahead of its competition,
marking the sixth time the Solar Car

Team has had a first place finish at the
ASC.
Spanning 1,100 miles from Broken
Arrow, Oklahoma to Naperville, Illi-
nois, the 2010 American Solar Chal-
lenge hosted 13 teams from a variety
of institutions, ranging from the Uni-
versity of Minnesota to the Bochum
University of Applied Sciences in Ger-
many.
Engineering senior Santosh Kumar,
the Solar Car Team's engineering
director, said that despite the team's
winning streak, he and the other mem-
bers were still concerned about wheth-
er they could beat the competition.
"Even though we had a much more
superior car, because of the slow
nature of the race, we knew that it
would be difficult to break away from

the press release that 6,900 students
out of those who have been accepted
have paid their enrollment deposits
thus far - a 43.2 percent yield rate of
those accepted to the University.
With the possibility that some stu-
dents who have already submitted
enrollment deposits will eventually
decide not to attend the University, the
projected size reaches its current num-
ber of 6,350 students.
As a result of the increased size in
the freshman class, Sanders noted that
the University is in the process of mak-
ing sure all students will be properly
accommodated in the fall.
"The University has created a work-
ing group to make sure incoming stu-
dents have a good year next year," she
said. "From making sure the dining
halls will be able to serve everyone ... to
the availability of classes."
Sanders said the management of the
admissions process "is more of an art
than a science" in working to eliminate
any possible problems in the applica-
tion and enrollment process for pro-
spective students and their families.
But Sanders said some factors, like
the economy, are out of the hands of
admissions officers. For that aspect,
Sanders said the University works to
ease the financial burden of paying for
college.
"The University responded to con-
cerns families had," she said. "The
Office of Financial Aid worked to pro-
vide individual assistance with plan-
ning to ease any financial concerns."
In their meeting last month, the
University's Board of Regents voted to
approve a 1.5-percent tuition increase
for in-state students and a 3-percent
tuition increase for out-of-state stu-
dents. The in-state tuition increase is
the smallest approved by the Board of
Regents in 26 years.
Sanders said she believes the Uni-
versity's choice to present a more mod-

est increase in tuition has helped to
ease the concerns of those preparing to
pay for new students' educations.
The University is not the only
school to have a growing applicant
pool, according to Sanders, who said
she believes students are beginning to
apply to a greater number of colleges
and that the overall college application
volume is up.
The University also announced its
official switch to the Common Appli-
cation for students considering apply-
ing to the University in future years.
Sanders said that while the ultimate
decision to switch to the Common
Application happened in the office of
Admissions, the decision was also sup-
ported by the University's executives.
Ted Spencer, executive director of
the office of Undergraduate Admis-
sions and associate vice provost for the
University, said the desire to improve
the overall application process led the
Office of Admissions to join the Com-
mon Application network.
"U-M decided to join the Common
Application because we are always
looking for ways to do better," Spencer
said in the press release. "Especially in
these challenging economic times, we
are looking for ways to do better with
less. We believe the Common App will
streamline the application process for
students, teachers, and counselors."
Sanders added that while the use of
the Common Application could initial-
ly save the office of Admissions money,
it is too early to determine if the appli-
cation network will ultimately be a
source of financial savings.
"It's too early to tell," Sanders said.
"Reports from peerschools indicate an
increase in applications, and the sav-
ings in application vendor may mean
additional money spent for process-
ing."
The University's use of the Com-
mon Application network will begin
Aug. 1, marking the first day applica-
tions for the 2011-2012 school year
may be submitted, according to the
press release.

Leave no worker behind
Career retraining programs are vital to recovery
Just when Michigan workers were starting to stand on their own two
feet, their knees are being knocked out from underneath them once
again. This time, it's by the federal government, which recently cut
its funding to the No Worker Left Behind program. Amid all the talk of
wasteful or unnecessary spending by governments on all levels, it's both
surprising and abhorrent to see the scalpel fall on a program with such a
remarkable record of success. Not only should federal funding be restored,
the project - and others like it - should be expanded across the country.

The United States Supreme Court is
once again deciding how much free-
dom to permit to all Americans. Old
rules do not apply, it seems, in the age
of the "war on terror." Our government
needs a whole new set of restrictions
on speech and advocacy: See the deci-
sion in Holder v. Humanitarian Law
Project, handed down June 21. For
some of us, this is nostalgia.
When we left-wing intellectuals
were being fired in the 1950s, I remem-
ber a snooty characterization by a
senior administrator at the University.
Let us call him Dean Abbott (I prefer
not to disclose his identity, but anyway
I don't recall his name). He assured a
meeting of the faculty that they didn't
need to waste their sympathy for those
who might be attacked in the Red
Hunt, for "these people are not impor-
taut."
As a 27-year-old neophyte scientist,
I didn't stand up and argue that I was
so important. I did right not to. The
firings, and the Congressional panels
and prison sentences that accompa-
nied them, were important all right
- but, for the most part, not because
they punished our dissent. The main
impact of these actions was that they
put a chill on dissent by everyone, not
just activists or radicals. The censors
believed that the quenching of criti-
cism was far more important than the
loss of our services to American aca-
demia. It wasn't even the loss of our
criticism that was so consequential
- far more important was the loss of
criticism from our colleagues who
remained in academia, but muted.
Later, when I refused to testify
before one of the Red-hunting com-
mittees of Congress, the press had the
idea that I was defending my right to
free speech. This was so oversimpli-
fied of an assumption that they had
nearly missed my entire point: For-
mer Congressman Rit Francis Clardy
(R-Mich.)'s committee was intimidat-
ing my fellow citizens, who were more
important because there were more
of them. I thought the courts ought to
outlaw the intimidation, so I chose to
defy it. The only way the courts could
have kept me out of prison, I figured,
was to rule that the committees were
overstepping their authority. The
courts didn't rule as I had hoped - not
until a decade later.

When I began my prison term, I
cockily put it this way to a reporter:
"Six months of my life is not too much
to give in the service of my country."
Another reporter asked me at the last
minute, "If you're willing to serve six
months in prison, why did you appeal
your conviction?" He really didn't get
it! I explained, as the federal marshals
whisked me away, "If I had won at the
Supreme Court, the hearings would
have been outlawed. That would have
been a bigger contribution." It would
have protected not my freedom of
speech, which is no more important
than any other individual's, but the
freedom of everyone's speech and
exchange of views, by which demo-
cratic decision can occur - without
which it can not.
And here we are again. Fifty-one
yearsaftercthe McCarran Internal
Security Act (1950), which estab-
lished the Subversive Activities Con-
trol Board, we now have the so-called
"Fatriot Act." Fifty-one years after
the Supreme Court ruled against
Lloyd Barenblatt and me in 1959,
the Supreme Court rules against
Ralph Fertig and upholds a ban on
the knowing provision of material
support or resources to a terrorist
organization, even if the support is
to further peaceful, nonviolent advo-
cacy or humanitarian aid.
We are supposed to shrug: after all,
some of the thousands whose right to
due process is annulled are probably
guilty of something. If Ralph Fertig is
prevented from helping some Kurds,
even though he offers them no weap-
ons but only teaching of non-violence,
why worry? Some of them are suppos-
edly guilty of something. But Dean
Abbott, however unfair his scorn was,
had it right in spite of himself. The
targets of political repression may not
be important. The repression is much
more important than any individual
target,becauseitis an attackonthelife
of society itself.
As my fellow defendant Pete Seeger
puts it, "When will they ever learn?"
Will it take the Supreme Court another
ten years and another score of cases to
re-learn what it finally came to see in
the 1970s?
Chandler Davis is a former
University mathematics professor.

No Worker Left Behind is a
government-funded initiative
to retrain Michigan workers for
in-demand jobs in high-growth
industries. To date, the program
has trained and/or retrained
131,833 people for new careers.
But on July 1, the program will be
forced to restrict its enrollment
due to lack of funding from the
federal government. The major-
ity of the program's remaining
money will go toward ensuring
all workers already enrolled are
able to finish their training.
Diversifying Michigan's econ-
omy is absolutely essential to the
state's recovery. Ensuring that
the entire state isn't dependent
on one sector, as it has been on
the auto industry, is a prerequi-
site to long-term economic sus-
tainability. By funding training
for a vast array of workers, the
program made sure there was a
skilled, diverse Michigan labor
force ready to be hired by in-state
companies in all fields. With-
out NWLB, many workers will

remain trained solely for jobs that
simply aren't coming back.
Of the 57,855 workers who
have completed training, over 75
percent have retained old jobs or
found new ones, according to the
Department of Energy, Labor and
Economic Growth. This program,
by all accounts, has had a signifi-
cant positive impact on Michigan
workers and employers at a time
when the unemployment rate sits
at 13.7 percent as of April 2010,
according to the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics. Several news
outlets, including The New York
Times, have highlighted an even
more troubling problem: Compa-
nies are looking for workers to
hire, but they can't find enough
with the skills and training they
are looking for. Such findings
demonstrate the clear and irre-
futable need for continued fund-
ing and support of NWLB.
This success indicates that
the federal government - which
has no balanced budget require-
ment - should be expanding the

program, not undermining it. By
funding training for struggling
workers, NWLB sets up a pipeline
for companies in high-growth
' industries to hire in-state work-
ers, making it easier for employ-
ers and employees to match up
quickly. This is a program that
any economy could use in both
good times and bad, as it cuts
down on the frictional unemploy-
ment that results from the inher-
ently time-consuming nature of
a job search. The federal govern-
ment should spearhead a national
initiative to set up similar pro-
grams across the country.
No Worker Left Behind has
been one of the rare gems in
Michigan's economic policy
over the past several years. But
with the deterioration of state
tax revenues over the course of
the prolonged downturn, federal
funding is increasingly needed to
keep the program going. Unfor-
tunately for Michigan's suffering
workers, the message from Wash-
ington has been, "Tough luck."

Sometimes words are actions. Not many
countries in the world are willing to call the
Russians occupiers. Just the Georgians,
and now the Americans."
- Alexander Rondeli, President of the Georgian Foundation for Strategic
and International Studies, as reported by The New York Times yesterday.

and reliabil- LEXI
ity. to sports, it's 2~f RA
easy to measure
success in wins
and losses - you can live and die
by numbers and relish in the lack
of subjectivity. On the volleyball
team, we crunch numbers all the
time to obtain black-and-white
explanations for problems with
our play. Our "side out" percentage
was either above 60% or it wasn't.
Our execution, or lack thereof,
translates directly into a win or
loss, and the numbers clearly tell
us how well we played.
But there are some games where
numbers can't tell the whole story.
What has always sparked my curi-
osity are the improbable games
that, statistically, just don't make
sense. Stats can tell you who's win-
ning or which hitter is hot, but they
don't explain how team "chemis-
try" affects a game. Chemistry is
difficult to explain, incredibly easy
to feel and often hard to come by.
But there's little consensus on what
this abstract concept is and how it
helps so many teams, especially
the underdogs, win. There's even
less agreement on how it affects
the way non-athlete groups work
together. I'm no expert, but I have
my theories.
A necessary precursor to chem-
istry is trust, which is earned
throughtherepetitionof consistent
behavior. In volleyball, this might
be digging a tip. In class, it could
be doing your assigned problems.
Either way, you're performing to
a consistent standard, and your
teammates (or classmates) associ-
ate you with that task. You earn
expectations and fulfill them, and
this creates a dynamic and interac-
tive atmosphere. If I had to worry
about someone else performing
your job, it would distract me from
my own, causing the whole team's
performance to suffer. Instead,
I know where they're going to be
because they've demonstrated that
they'll always be there.
The goal of any group working
together is to produce. Constant
management is needed to con-
sistently cut down on error and
continue to pursue perfection.

This particular aspect of chemis-
try allows your team to maintain
focus, which is one of the crucial
tools needed to achieve your goals
- be it winning a game or complet-
ing homework.
Chemistry is the
foundation of a
group's success.
Effective leadership is another
fundamental component of chem-
istry. It guides those raw tools your
team worked so hard to cultivate
toward one collective vision. Being
a leader demands constant re-eval-
uation of goals and direction based
on the current situation. Where
management is focused on the
process, leadership is concerned
with making sure you're aiming
toward the right end result. War-
ren Bennis, known as the pioneer of
"leadership studies," identified this
difference between leadership and
management in saying, "Manage-
ment is doing things right. Leader-
ship is doing the right things."
In every successful team I have
been a part of, every member has
had one of these clearly defined
roles: managers, leaders and pro-
ducers. These are all essential to a
group's success, but each role has
different requirements. Be it the
volleyball team or a student orga-
nization, personnel may change
but there are always people spe-
cializing in each of these duties.
The leader makes sure the team is
focused and inspires them to stay
that way. The manager looks for
ways the group can better itself.
And producers get through the
legwork by concentrating on their
own individual responsibilities.
Being a good teammate means
looking at your team and figuring
out which of these roles it needs,
not which one you want to fill. If
you are newly joining the Olympic
team, your main focus should be
on your own efficiency and pro-
duction, since it's expected that
everyone else will already be per-
forming at a high level. If you join
the ranks of a student organiza-
tion that isn't performing, maybe
you lead and delegate manage-
ment. Success as a team relies on
each role functioning and balanc-
ing out the other two.

We're not living in the Matrix

Besides the occasional col-
lege student too obsessed
with Facebook to spend
time on anything
else, the human
race isn't yet the j
slave of comput-
ers. Machines
aren't mining
people for elec-
tricity and feeding
them a cocktail NICHOLAS
of dead bodies as CLIFT
imagined by the
"Matrix" trilogy.
But they are revolutionizing the way
we perceive the universe.
On a fundamental level, progress
in modern science requires comput-
ers. You may remember (or not) that
in introductory science courses,
things are "ideal": balls are thrown
in rooms without air, gases are made
of particles with no mass, magnetic
fields are perfectly uniform and
football teams never lose. But when
things stop being ideal, when wind
and mass and randomness are taken
into account, things get hairy quite
quickly. Researchers in every dis-
cipline rely on computers to study
these hairier realms of reality.
But it's interesting to consider
whether the rise of computers in
science might herald the beginning
of the end of human intuition as
the driving force in science, as did
a recent episode of the WNYC-pro-
duced radio show Radiolab, titled
"Limits." Ph.D. students working
on Eureka, a computer at Cornell
University, set their computer to
watch a pendulum swing back and
forth. And then, after doing this for
24 hours ... boom! Their computer
program produced a simple, beauti-
ful equation: F = ma, Sir Isaac New-
ton's second law of motion and one
of the most important equations in
all of science. In one day, Eureka
found something that had eluded
the human race for millennia.
Something similar happened to
a biologist when he fed Eureka data
he had collected from cell behavior.

Unlike in the case of the pendulum,
though, the equation was like noth-
ing biologists had seen before. And
while the equation clearly worked,
the biologist was at a loss to under-
stand one crucial thing: why.
Computers are giving us extraor-
dinary power. But does that mean
that, in general, scientists like the
aforementioned biologist have a less
intuitive understanding of their sci-
ence? The answer I've come up with
is a resounding "no."
In fact, Sharon Glotzer told me
they do just the opposite. "(Com-
puters) can help give intuition," she
said. She's the Stuart W. Churchill
Professor of Chemical Engineering
with faculty appointments in four
other departments and Director of
Research Computing in the College
of Engineering. She felt computers
can help scientists see trends in data
(think of making a graph).
Now, I know what you might be
thinking: Eureka isn't like other
computers most scientists are using.
But Eureka is more normal than you
might think. Like other computers,
-it's just providing analysis based on
a computer algorithm written by
humans. All computers perform a
series of calculations that, Glotzer
confirmed, could be performed by
a billion well-coordinated eighth-
grade mathletes.
And that's really what computing
is all about. August Evrard, Arthur
F. Thurnau Professor of Physics,
uses computers extensively in his
work studying cosmology. He told
me that the crazy-cool thing about
Eureka, and all computation used
in modern scientific research, is
its ability to make sense of huge,
unfathomably large quantities
of data. That power is being har-
nessed by "almost any field you can
think of," Evrard informed me. The
ATLAS detector at the Large Had-
ron Collider in Switzerland, the
largest particle accelerator in the
world, generates 3,200 terabytes
of data every day. It doesn't matter
how decked out your abacus is -

you can't make sense of that with-
out powerful computers.
Computers simply
aren't replacing
human scientists.
If Mark Newman, Paul Dirac Col-
legiate Professor of Physics, could
do billions of mathematical calcula-
tions in his head every second, he
might not need to use computers.
But when you want to know how
fast a disease spreads, it doesn't mat-
ter how well you intuitively under-
stand that sneezing on other people
spreads infection. The only way to
know how soon everyone else will be
infected, he told me, is to ask a com-
putertocrunchthenumbers.There's
a reason most people don't just run
quick, computational simulations
in their head. "If the real world is
too complicated to understand," he
said, your computer model probably
would be as well.
But such models could always be
reduced to the underlying scientific
or mathematical principles govern-
ing them. Computers like Eureka
have an important, intriguing role to
play in science - a role I don't think
includes replacing human intuition.
Computers are still far from being
able to "think" for themselves.
Eureka's biologist didn't under-
stand why his equation worked,
but he'll have to figure that out in
order to build on the computer's
discovery - something unthinking
computers can't do for him. Science
just doesn't work without scientists
who understand their fields. And
for as long as the universe remains
fathomable to humans and comput-
ers remain unable to "think," I don't
see that changing.

Supreme missteps

ELAINE MORTON

E-MAIL ELAINE AT EMORT@UMICH.EDU.

t seems as though everyone has
been so wrapped up in Solicitor
General Elena Kagan's judicial
confirmation hear-
ings that they've
unintentionally
turned a blind
eye to the rather
explosive decisions
recently handed
down by the nine
justices already sit- NOEL
ting on the bench. GORDON
Over the course
of a single month,
the Supreme Court incorporated the
right to keep and bear arms into the
14th Amendment, reworked the very
fabric of the Miranda warning and
affirmed a ban on soft money con-
tributions to political campaigns.
Given the rather ideologically par-
tisan nature of the Supreme Court
nowadays, two out of three correct-
ly decided cases isn't that bad of an
outcome. And even though I person-
ally would've left Miranda alone, the
decision in that case didn't trouble
me nearly as much as the one in
Christian Legal Society v. Martinez.
I have a great amount of respect for
the Supreme Court, and that hasn't
changed - even when Justice Scalia
writes dissents that make my blood
boil. I readily admit that I have little
understanding of the complex inner
workings of our legal system or the

various approaches to interpreting
the Constitution. But I don't think
that a lack of experience or rigorous
study necessarily invalidates conclu-
sions that I reach that are different
from the High Court's.
No viewpoint
should be denied
recognition.
That said, the Christian Legal
Society at the University of Califor-
nia Hastings Law School allowed all
students to attend its meetings, but
they required that those interested
in voting or running for office sign a
statement of faith affirmingtheir com-
mitment to Judeo-Christian values.
Incidentally, gay and lesbian students
that had been attending CLS meet-
ings were not allowed to take part in
these activities since Holy Scripture
designates homosexuality a sin. This
eligibility requirement caused some
students to argue that the CLS was
in violation of the public university's
antidiscrimination policy.
In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme
Court narrowly held that a law
school can legally deny recognition
and funding to a Christian student

' / a

group that won't permit homosex-
ual students from being a part of
the organization. Justice John Paul
Stevens wrote, "Other groups may
exclude or mistreat Jews, blacks and
women - or those who do not share
their contempt for Jews, blacks and
women. A free society must tolerate
such groups. It need not subsidize
them, give them its official imprima-
tur, or grant them equal access to law
school facilities."
However, I disagree with the
Supreme Court decision for two main
reasons.
First, the Christian Legal Society
should not have been denied recogni-
tion by the University of California
simply because it required an affir-
mation of faith from those interested
in taking a more active role in the
group. I don't find such a request to
be that unreasonable, especially con-
sidering that the requirement was
not a condition for general member-
ship. I think members of the CLS

had the same rationale the Supreme
Court did when it held in Boy Scouts
of America v. Dale that a private orga-
nization can exclude a person from
membership when "the presence of
that person affects in a significant
way the group's ability to advocate
public or private viewpoints." I think
senior members probably thought
that having an officer whose lifestyle
did not align with Holy Scriptures
would have significantly impacted
their ability to effectively advocate
their viewpoints and beliefs.
Second, and more importantly,
the Christian Legal Society should
not have been denied funding. Hast-
ings claimed that it withheld money
from the CLS because it believed the
group was in violation of its anti-dis-
crimination policy and was therefore
ineligible to receive said funding. But
I reject Hastings' liberal definition
of discrimination and feel as though
the Christian Legal Society's actions
should not have fallen under this

rather broadly construed category.
In Christian Legal Society v. Walker,
the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals
held that "traditional non-discrim-
ination policy may not be applied to
religious groups who require astate-
ment of faith from members."
For some reason, the Supreme
Court chose to ignore previous deci-
sion and allowed the Hastings policy
to stand. But the fact of the matter
remains that students from all back-
grounds benefited from the Chris-
tian Legal Society and its services.
CLS served as an invaluable resource
for students that identified as part
of a Judeo-Christian faith, and any
student organization that provides
a service that benefits a significant
portion of the student populace
should be funded, lest the state have
a compelling reason not to do so. And
in this case, the state did not.

Never been kissed

I'm kind of like Drew Barry-
more's character in that movie,
"Never Been Kissed," except I
doubt that my
story will end
with me mak-
ing out with my
Prince Charming
on a baseball field.
Okay, I've
never actually
seen that movie. RACHEL
But I know its VANGILDER
basic plot. And
I'll be honest: One
of my biggest fears is ending up like
the spinster aunt from any namber
of films and TV shows. I'm nearly 21
years old and I've never had a boy-
friend or been kissed. So Courtney
Fletcher's most recent column struck
a chord with me.
Fletcher, a fellow Daily staffer
and a member of the University's
volleyball team, discussed her his-
tory with the opposite sex (Boys and
arrested development, 06/25/2010).

She described a heart-wrenching
experience of rejection at age nine
(I've been there, Courtney), and her
lackluster high school dating record
(I've been there, too). She also said
that college hasn't been much better
(Join the club - I'm the president).
I wasn't encouraged by this tale of
woe. Courtney is a lot better looking
than me, plus she's athletic and intel-
ligent. If Fletcher hasn't been par-
ticularly lucky in love, what hope is
there for me? I asn so S.O.L.
But that's enough of that pity
party. Fletcher meant her column
as encouragement to other young
women and expressed a gung-ho
spirit that I admire, but she reached
a conclusion that I don't agree with.
She determined that "boys are mere-
ly a distraction." Being in the same
boat as Fletcher, I think the situation
is more complex than that. Young
women certainly shouldn't base their
self-worth on their relationship (or
lack thereof) to guys. But they also
shouldn't let a rocky start to relation-

ships define their perspective of love
- or the opposite sex.
Fletcher's reaction is one that
a lot of people have. It's certainly
very prominent thinking in a lot of
feminist circles. I often hear strong,
intelligent women announcing that
women don't need men.
I don't buy that. Women need men.
And men need women. People need
each other.
I think that the "women don't need
men" battle cry is often repeated as
an act of self-preservation. It's cer-
tainly easier to become defensive
than feel lonely. Or, worse, to feel
like there's something wrong with
you. I've felt that way. But a quick
Google search revealed thread after
thread started by young women who
feel the same way, and a handful of
blogs discuss the topic as well. The
search made me feel a bit better. It's
encouraging to know I"m not a one-
of-a-kind romantic anomaly.
According to 2005 statistics - the
most recent I could find - accumu-
lated by The Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender, and Repro-
duction, about 75 percent of men and
women have sex between the ages of

18 and 19. And 19 percent of women
between the ages of 20 and 21 are vir-
gins. The percentage drops to about
8 percent between ages 22 and 24.
Granted, having sex and having a boy-
friend aren't the same thing by any
stretch of the imagination. But being
part of the minority here is still an
uncomfortable place to be, because it's
easy to see yourself as the freak.
I'm lonely.
And that's
just fine.
That's why I'll admit that saying
that women don't need men isn't the
unhealthiest perspective a woman
can develop. It certainly encourages
self-reliance and inner strength. Of
course I support these qualities in
the modern woman and like to think
that I have both. And I certainly don't
think that women - especially young
women like me who are in the process
of growing and developing their indi-

viduality - should feel like they need a
boyfriend tobe complete.
My outlook on relationships -
which has been determined mostly
by love songs, literature and bad tele-
vision shows - is that people need
to feel confident about themselves
in order to be capable of having a
healthy romantic relationship. I've
known a few people who have vest-
ed too much of their self-worth and
identity in having a relationship. And
that can't be healthy.
Women should be able to stand
on their own two feet before they
attempt to lean on someone else or let
someone else lean on them. And rela-
tionships - romantic and platonic
- are about reciprocity. But you can
be complete and lonely at the same
time. For example, I like to think I
am generally a complete person. But
sometimes I also feel like the focus of
a crooning country song about lonely
hearts and neon moons. I don't think
that makes me weak. I think it makes
me human.

CME FUNDING
From Page 1
Woolliscroft said leaders in the med-
ical school community looked at lit-
erature detailing the psychological
effects of commercially supported
education and relationship-building
in marketing, ultimately concluding
that accepting CME funding from
commercial industries simply "was
not the right thing to do."
"We were concerned that we don't
want there to be even a perception of
bias in what is being communicated
to physicians," he said.
In an interview with The New York
Times last month, Rafael Fonseca,
who teaches 20 to 30 CME courses a
year and is the deputy director of the
Mayo Clinic Cancer Center in Scotts-
dale, Arizona, said CME classes keep
doctors up to date in their fields and
that bias is not an issue.
"We present what we think is the
state-of-the-art of the management
of the disease," he said in the inter-
view. "The accusation that there is

bias is not substantiated."
The January edition of the Jour-
nal of Academic Medicine pub-
lished a study from the Cleveland
Clinic Foundation, which reported
that "prospective analysis found no
evidence that commercial support
results in perceived bias in CME
activities."
The study looked at evaluations
from 95,429 participants in 346 CME
activities at the Cleveland Clinic. The
evaluations asked participants to
rate how well the activities met the
ACCME standards for commercial
support and whether the activities
were free from commercial bias.
Depending on the activity, only 1.0
to 6.8 percent of respondents gave a
"fair" or "poor" rating on how well
their activities met the ACCME stan-
dards, and 97.3 to 99.2 percent of par-
ticipants said they felt the activities
were free from commercial bias.
Of the activities under investiga-
tion, 56.9 percent were not commer-
cially funded, but the study showed
no statistically significant difference
in perceived bias between the com-

mercially funded activities and the
others.
A similar study from the Univer-
sity of California, San Francisco,
published in the same issue of the
Journal of Academic Medicine, found
that "rates of perceived bias were low
for the vast majority of CME activi-
ties in the sample and did not differ
by the degree of industry support or
other event characteristics."
The UCSF study reported that
95 to 99 percent of participants in
213 CME activities said they did
not perceive commercial bias in the
activities, and as in the Cleveland
Clinic study, there was no correlation
between level of commercial support
and perceived commercial bias.
Both studies concluded that under
the ACCME regulations, commer-
cially funded CME activities can
be free from bias. They both added,
however, that the institutions under
investigation, the Cleveland Clinic
and UCSF, might have more rigor-
ous screening processes for indus-
try supporters than other accredited
CME institutions and recommended
further investigation at other institu-
tions.
Both studies also suggested that
a more subtle, undetectable form of
bias could be present.
The UCSF study, for example,
mentioned that speakers might sub-
consciously tailor their presenta-
tions for commercial benefit. Dean
Woolliscroft said he agreed that
such studies may not uncover certain
biases because participants can't per-
ceive them.
"None of us feel that we can be
influenced," Woolliscroft said, "but
yet all of us, if we step back, realize
that the whole marketing industry
clearly is successful."
Woollistroft added that whether
the bias is real or not, doctors have a
"social covenant" with their patients
and owe it to them to not even allow
the question of bias.
Tom Sullivan, president of Rock-
pointe Corporation, a medical edu-
cation company based in Columbia,
Maryland, criticized the University
for making this decision without evi-
dentiary support that commercially
funded CMA classes are biased,
especially when the Cleveland Clinic
and UCSF have published extensive
reports that suggest the contrary.
Sullivan said it's not necessary to
take commercial funding away from
CME, and in fact, the University's
decision will ultimately hurt the
CME courses offered at the medical
school.
Funding from pharmaceutical and
device companies, he said, allows
CME providers to organize smaller
class sizes that create a more person-
al environment where doctors can
get direct instruction on new treat-
ments and technologies.

"There's a need for people to be
able to discuss in forums practical
applications," Sullivan said. "You
want your doctor educated on how
something works ... you don't want
him reading the book while he's
doing the operation."
Sullivan warned that without
commercial funding, such intimate
atmospheres would "not be as readily
available," adding that he wouldn't be
surprised if the University changed
its mind after two or three years.
Woolliscroft said, come January,
class participants can expect a sud-
den disappearance of company rep-
resentatives and advertisements, but
the classes themselves will remain
the same.
Woolliscroft also said in the long
run, Sullivan's concern about lecture
quality will become obsolete because
he and others in the medical school
hope to entirely revolutionize the
CME program by moving away from
lecture-style classes and instead
toward technology-aided education.
"It's been recognized that lectures
are not a very effective way to change
care for patients, that physicians
oftentimes do not incorporate into
their practice patterns what they've
learned," he said.
The loss of personal interaction is
a potential downside to technologi-
cally-driven education, Woolliscroft
admitted, but by the same token, doc-
tors will be able to have virtual con-
versations with colleagues not only
throughout the U.S., but throughout
the world.
"We're in a time of change, so we
haven't migrated fully away from a
lecture format to some new way of
enhancing learning, soit's going to be
a time of transition when other reve-
nue sources are also constrained," he
said. "It's really actually a very excit-
ing time, and we're just in the begin-
ning of a big change in education, not
just in medicine."
Recognizing the immediate need
to compensate for lost funding,
Woolliscroft said the medical school
will have to increase class registra-
tion fees and host classes in less
expensive venues. Departments and
divisions in the medical school have
also offered to help compensate for
the loss, he said.

announces new
merchandiser
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter

The University Athletic Depart-
ment announced last week that The
M-Den will once again be the offi-
cial merchandiser for University
athletics.
When M-Den's 10-year contract
expired in June 2009, the Texas-
based apparel company eSports
Partner Inc. outcompeted M-Den
and other companies to become the
University's new merchandiser for
the next decade.
Jason Winters, the chief finan-
cial officer for the athletic depart-
ment, told The Michigan Daily at
the time that eSports Partners Inc.
promised to make $1.5 million dol-
lars in its first year as merchandis-
er. According to Winters, M-Den
typically generated $500,000 to
$600,000 per year.
"There were a number of enti-
ties interested," Winters said at the
time. "We were looking for better
royalty rates, economic perfor-
mance (and the) ability to grow and
respond to consumers."
The athletic department has ter-
minated its contract with eSports
Partners Inc. after one year, Win-
ters said, because the company
failed to meet performance stan-
dards set in the contract.
"There were several issues that
allowed us to terminate the agree-
ment and get out of it. There was a
general service element that was
missing as well as a financial ele-
ment," he said. "In general terms,
they failed to reach their guaran-
teed sales and royalty levels."
He added that the athletic
department was pleased with the
company's performance during
football game days last fall, but as
the year went on, product availabil-
ity became an issue and the e-com-
merce side of business was not up to
par.

Latest film version of
Twilight' saga doesn't
even tryto be good
By ANKUR SOHONI
DailyArts Writer
Television, books and cinema
have all been swayed by the sexy
danger of the fang in vampire tales
like "Twilight."
However, like its **
mythical crea-
tures of choice, the The Twilight
saga's latest film, Sag: Ecips
"Eclipse," is rather
cold and dead. At Quality 16
The core story and Rave
of Stephenie Mey- Summit
er's "Twilight"
saga isn't original, nor does it really
claim to be. Meyer's work is unique,
though, in that she simplified her idea
enough to be lapped up by millennial
teenage girls and those with equiva-
lent intellectual maturities. That
said, even the most puerile fan should
have a hard time accepting this new
installment as entertainment.
"Eclipse" continues the story of
Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), the
lovely young (aspiring) fang-banger
with a giant, six-packed werewolf
problem. While she tries to choose
between charming vamp Edward
(Robert Pattinson) and dreamy were-
wolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner), the plot
thickens as the two species - ancient
enemies - unite against an approach-
ing vampire army.
The film improves immenselyupon
the structure of "Twilight" and "New
Moon" - after two hours, at least
something has happened. Three films
in, it's as good a time as any to nail
down basic plot conventions.
A few moments, such as Edward's
furious battle to protect Bella in the

last act, provide a human spark to the
fake ashes of the film. But the rest is
lifeless, and it really didn't have to be.
This isn't "Harry Potter." While
not exactly a lesson in adaptation or a
clinic in screenwriting, the boy wiz-
ard's movie series has established an
air of dedication in each installment,
distinguishing itself from the half-
assed "Twilight."
"Eclipse" is like a cake without
sugar, and never baked with love. No
one seems to have put in even a mea-
gerly consistent effort to improve
upon the flat acting and overdramatic,
comatose mise-en-scene of the first
two films.
The drama is characterized by
limp acting from the three leads, save
for the occasional thrust of vaguely
human energy. Their performances
are not so much a reflection of a lack
of talent; rather, they seem to suf-
fer from the wholly unprepared and
inconsistent direction of David Slade
("30 Days of Night"). Don't expect an
ensemble performance - it's rare that
more than one actor really shows up
in any given scene.
The dialogue is insanely dull and
slows the entire project to muck.
While it is a failure shared equally by
the screenplay, direction and acting,
it's unfortunate that the same screen-
writer, Melissa Rosenberg, was given
the opportunity to once again spill ink
in the general shape of a movie script.
The film also dulls one of the few
shining aspects of its predecessors:
the music. The "Eclipse" compila-
tion soundtrack is superb and worth
an independent listen, but its tracks
are used ineptly in the film. "Lord of
the Rings" composer Howard Shore
tried his best to score the film but
was allowed only scattered cues. And
as the third composer to work on the
series, his efforts are in many ways
futile: The "Twilight" films have been

denied a single central musical theme,
an almost essential tool in sustaining
other film franchises.
Thebiggest problem with"Eclipse"
is its creators' blind acceptance of the
film adaptation as a naturally inferior
form; they don't even attempt to tran-
scend mass expectations.
Who didn't expect this movie to
suck? Even the film's creators seem to
expect mediocrity, and they did little
beyond the bare minimum. Loyal
fans, even those with low expecta-
tions, deserve better.
If you see "Eclipse," expect a
challenge. There are sparse tender
moments to be had, but they require a
constant resistance to the atmosphere
of mockery in the theater. The aver-
age audience member needs to work
hard to seriously enjoy this film.

Directing with Duplasses

'Cyrus' makers talk
about their grassroots
filmmaking philosophy
By ANKUR SOHONI
DailyArts Writer
On Jan.28, the Sundance Film Fes-
tival sent eight filmmakers, movies in
tow, to eight different theaters across
the country. The film festival publi-
cized "Sundance USA" as an event to
bring the country together for a cel-
ebration of cinema and discourse.
One of the eight theaters selected
for the event was Ann Arbor's very
own Michigan Theater, which wel-
comed filmmakers Jay and Mark
Duplass, co-writer-directors of the
film "Cyrus," for a screening and
Q&A session. Ann Arbor residents
flocked to the Michigan for the event,

and with a strange self-awareness sat
in the huge, sold-out theater to watch
a small independent film.
Five months later, "Cyrus" is now
in nationwide limited release. The
new film attracted stars like Jonah
Hill, John C. Reilly and Marisa
Tomei, giving the directing team
its best chance yet to reach a bigger
audience. With a somewhat rebel-
lious approach to filmmaking, the
Duplass brothers represent a new
wave of filmmakers creating a new,
rawer dramatic form. "Cyrus" is
their biggest film yet, and with a new
Paramount Pictures film, "Jeff Who
Lives at Home," due out next year,
the brothers have a chance to take
their style to new heights.
That's not to say they don't have a
taste for the classic film experience.
With the film industry slowly shift-
ing from the theater to home video,
the brothers expressed affection for
tradition and how it affects their
filmmaking process in an interview
with the Daily.
"In an ideal world, I will say that
in a packed movie theater is the ideal
screening of our movies," said older
brother Jay Duplass at the Birming-
ham 8 theater in Birmingham. "You
get the full laughter, but you also get
the punch of the emotion towards
the end. It just takes longer to get
there."
Mark Duplass noted that home
video gave their previous films "The
Puffy Chair" (2005) and "Baghead"
(2008) an entirely different iden-

tity than did their respective theater
releases.
"When there are people around
you laughing, it gives you permis-
sion to laugh," he said. "It turns
it much more into a comedy. 'The
Puffy Chair,' at home, feels like a
hard-hitting relationship drama. In a
movie theater it feels like 'Dumb and
Dumber.' It's like night and day."
"Cyrus" is being marketed nation-
wide as "a brutally honest comedy."
With their film in the hands of Fox
Searchlight, the brothers hope to win
over new viewers and fans to their
singular'style.
"Fox Searchlight has been really
good at marketing these kinds of
movies," Mark said. "We've trust-
ed them in a lot of ways ... We don't
know how to get this movie to a big
group of people, and they kind of do."
"Cyrus" continues the brothers'
trademark improvisational directing
style, which has gained them critical
acclaim in years past.
"There will be a writing process,
and then we start shooting, and we
really start seeing what (the actors).
are like," Mark said. "Then we start
- even if we don't put it in the script
- tailoring the scenes and how we
direct the scenes, going to their
strengths and avoiding their weak-
nesses."
Jay spoke about the transition
from pre-production to production,
characterizing it as unpredictable
but ultimately liberating.
"You have these ideas and then,

you know, people come on set and
start doing shit, and it's totally dif-
ferent," he said. "It's very important
to be really honest about what you're
getting. Sometimes it's better, some-
times it's worse, sometimes it's weird
and different and you need to learn
how to adjust."
Their style contrasts with stan-
dard Hollywood protocol, in which
the directors tend to force everyone
around them to adjust. The director
is often seen as the creative dicta-
tor of the cinematic form, but the
Duplass brothers seem entirely com-
fortable turning the system on its
end, turning the director into a reac-
tionary filmmaking force.
Placing the actor in the role of
pseudo-screenwriter, the Duplass
brothers' style empowers their cast
with the opportunity for a more
creative presence in the film. Nev-
ertheless, Mark, who is an actor as
well, noted a fundamental differ-
ence between an improv actor and a
writer.
"(Actors are) not trying to gener-
ate comedy, so they're not thinking
as writers so much ... They're just try-
ing to inhabit a character, and re-say
the existing lines in new, interesting,
surprising, natural ways," he said.
Jay described the mindset differ-
ently, noting that the brothers direct
actors to focus on a single goal.
" 'I gotta get out of this goddamn
room before this guy shuts me down,
and I gotta do whatever it takes,'" he
said, putting himself in the mind of

an actor. "When you instill that moti-
vation in somebody, and you know
your character, it becomes really
exciting and creative and vibrant."
Their shooting methods also playa
role in allowing their style to sustain
itself.
Filming documentary-style with a
fully lit set, the directors allow each
actor to fully inhabit another person-
ality - one with independent moti-
vations and movements. While their
style presents a unique challenge to
actors, it also gives them more free-
dom.
"We bring the camera to them.
That's what so great and so terrify-
ing about it at the same time," Jay
said. "Once they embrace it, we run a
whole take. We don't do line per line
like a lot of films do."
But the brothers are quick to admit
how difficult their process is. Every
day of production requires a special
self-confidence, and the entire cast
and crew must keep up scene by
scene.
"Having the spirit and strength to
believe that, even though the scene
sucks right now, we're going to find
something" is key, Mark Duplass
said.
"It keeps it alive," Jay added. "But
it makes it very important to be..."
"Vigilant," Mark interjected.
"Cyrus" returns to the Michi-
gan Theater July 9. However, if the
Duplass brothers' dedication is any
sign, it certainly won't be the last
time we hear from them.

Lucas-Perry dismissed from basketball team

Flint native was
expected to take on
larger role with
inexperienced team
By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Writer
After the recent . departures of
Manny Harris and DeShawn Sims -
the Wolverines two leading scorers
last season - the Michigan basketball
team was already in question for next
season.
But as Michigan coach John Beilein
announced on June 30, the Wolver-
ines are going to be missing another
regular starter next year as well.
Redshirt-junior guard Laval Lucas-
Perry was dismissed from the basket-
ball program for a violation of team
rules.
"The University of Michigan and
our men's basketball program has
established expectations essential to
the success of all students and ath-
letes," Beilein said in a press release.
"These university and team standards
have been clearly communicated
to the team and Laval on numerous
occasions through meetings, confer-
ences and mentorship.
"Unfortunately, Laval has violated
our team standards. Therefore, I have
decided that he will no longer be a
part of our basketball program. Given
the fact that Laval is near the comple-

tion of his degree, he has been extend-
ed the offer to remain on scholarship
for the 2010-11 academic year and
graduate in May with our 2011 class."
Lucas-Perry started all but 10
games last season, but struggled to
shoot well from behind the arc. He
shot 29 percent from 3-point range,
despite his reputation as a sharp-
shooter.
In his first full season playing for
Beilein after transferring from Ari-
zona, he averaged 4.8 points and 2.3
rebounds in 21 minutes per game.

New assistants hope to foster winning environment

Bacari Alexander and
LaVall Jordan bring
extensive basketball
knowledge to 'M'
By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Writer
After the Michigan men's basket-
ball team's mediocre 15-17 record
this past season, coach John Beilein
recently added two new assistant
coaches to assist second-year assistant
coach, Jeff Meyer.
With the recent appointment of
Bacari Alexander and LaVall Jordan,
the team hopes to have a fresh, new
direction as it looks to bounce back
from a lackluster season, a year fol-
lowing the Wolverines' first NCAA
Tournament appearance since 1998.

In Jordan's first year as assistant
coach with Butler in 2004, the Bull-
dogs were 13-15 overall and 7-9 in the
Horizon League. But by the time Jor-
dan left the Bulldogs in 2007, Butler
finished the season 29-7 and made it to
the second round of the NCAA Tour-
nament.
Originally from Albion, Jordan
played basketball at Butler where he
was a standout guard, helping the
Bulldogs to four post-season appear-
ances, three NCAA Tournaments and
one NIT Tournament.
After college, Jordan played over-
seas and in the National Basketball
Developmental League but saw signif-
icant differences between the college
game and the professional playing
field.
"Something I loved as a player
was just the details of the game and I
wanted to go on and play as long as I

Jordan returned to Butler to work
as Coordinator of Basketball Opera-
tions in 2003. After just one season,
he was promoted to assistant coach
where he stayed for three seasons
before moving to Iowa with Butler
head coach Todd Licklite. For three
seasons he worked as an assistant
coach with the Hawkeyes before trad-
ing in his old gold for maize.
"This thing isn't about us," Jordan
said. "We have our part and our job
is to put our signature on our little
chapter of the entire Michigan story,
so that's how I look at it. Because of
the tradition, because of the history,
because of the standard that's been
set before us, for us to recapture it and
carry on what others have done."
Along with Jordan, Alexander will
also hope to bring his past playing and
coaching experience to Ann Arbor,

at the University of Detroit Mercy.
From there, he briefly worked as Play-

Detroit Pistons before returning to

ters. But after 498 shows, Alexander

his ability to forge relationships with
-- the young Michigan squad and look-
ingforward to doing so.
"What basketball has really done
-1 for me is that it's opened up doors to
build long lasting and meaningful
relationships with people from all
walks of life," Alexander said. "And
r that also is the essence of sports in
general. It brings people from dif-
ferent socioeconomic backgrounds,
belief systems and mesh(es) them all
together."
In 1999, Alexander received UDM's
Si 'imost outstanding senior student-ath-
lete award, an award demonstrating
how he holds in high regard the value
of a quality education. He sees him-
S- self as an educator of the young men
he coaches and sees a deep connec-
tion between the relationships a coach
has and the influence a coach has on
its players, which is what has drawn
him to every school and coach he has
coached with.
"They're all educators first," Alex-
ander said of the coaches he has
-,worked under. "I always have taken
great interest in being associated
with people that are educators first.
The common denominator academi-
cally for all of those coaches is that
they've graduated in the 98th per-
centile of their players, which is very,
very important to me. Obviously we're
hired to win games and put competi-
T H E tive teams on the floor, but at the same
time, the academic piece is something
" C U TYRED S * that'sreallyattractive."
Additionally, Alexander has been

coms 'Runway to the Fashionable
Four,' a title that declares him the
' 734.994 .6 7 most fashionable coach in college bas-

fully CollegeInsider will find maize
and blue just as fashionable on Alex-
ander.
