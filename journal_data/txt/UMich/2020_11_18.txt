Since learning earlier this 

month most housing contracts 
for 
residence 
halls 
will 
be 

canceled for the winter semester 
to keep as many people as 
possible off campus, freshmen 
have been struggling to make 
accommodations. 

In an email sent on Nov. 6, 

University of Michigan President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
outlined 
the 

expected 
changes 
for 
the 

semester.

“To reduce density in our 

residence halls, undergraduates 
who don’t need to be on campus 
should remain at their permanent 
residences 
for 
the 
semester 

and study remotely,” Schlissel 
wrote. 
“U-M 
Housing 
will 

move exclusively to single-room 
occupancy.”

Since then, students currently 

in dorms have been scrambling 
to find off-campus housing for 
next semester, mostly through 
subleases starting in January. 

LSA 
freshman 
Sophie 

Steinberg said the sudden news 
sparked intense competition in 
the local housing market.

“I 
ended 
up 
getting 
an 

apartment with my friends, but 
that was a really hectic process 
because places were constantly 
being signed off on,” Steinberg 
said. “You would call a realtor 
and ask to look somewhere 
because it was available online 
but then they’d call you back and 
say, ‘Oh, that just signed,’ and that 
happened to us multiple times.”

States across the country, 

including 
Michigan, 
are 

experiencing record numbers 
of COVID-19 infections. As 
the cases continue to rise, the 
University of Michigan hospital 
system, 
Michigan 
Medicine, 

is preparing for the increased 
hospitalizations 
which 
are 

likely to follow. 

As of Thursday, Michigan has 

a total of 236,235 COVID cases 
and 7,811 COVID deaths. This 
comes as cases in the U.S. hit 
more than 10.8 million cases and 
deaths reach close to 250,000. 
The 
number 
of 
COVID-19-

related 
hospitalizations 
has 

hit record numbers, with over 
65,000 nationwide for the first 
time since the beginning of the 
pandemic. 

Gov. 
Gretchen 
Whitmer 

warned this could be the worst 
part of the pandemic yet for 
the state at a press conference 
Thursday.

“This is the moment that 

medical 
experts 
have 
been 

warning us about and dreading 
since the beginning of this 
pandemic,” Whitmer said. “Our 

case numbers are skyrocketing 
here in Michigan.”

Robert Hyzy, an internal 

medicine 
and 
Michigan 

Medicine 
medical 
director 

of the critical care unit, said 
Michigan Medicine has been 
experiencing a recent surge in 
COVID-19 cases. 

“The last two weeks have 

really been a noticeable uptick 
in activity,” Hyzy said. “Things 
have really started to take off 
again, unfortunately.”

The 
hospital 
system 
is 

preparing to transition certain 
units back to primarily serving 
COVID-19 
patients. 
The 

hospital command center has 
also been reactivated, Hyzy 
said, which allows a wide 
variety of people, including 
doctors, nurses, maintenance 
workers and infectious control 
experts, to give daily updates. 

Robert 
Dickson, 
associate 

professor of medicine in the 
Division of Pulmonary and 
Critical Care Medicine, said 
Michigan Medicine is working 
to re-expand its capacity to care 
for COVID-19 patients, in terms 
of both space and staff.

Chief medical officer: ‘We never stopped

Days before the University 

of Michigan was set to move 
to 
fully 
remote 
instruction, 

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and 
Robert Gordon, director of the 
Michigan Department of Health 

and Human Services, put the 
final nail in the coffin of what 
was left of the school’s plan for a 
hybrid semester.

Gordon joined Whitmer at a 

press conference Sunday night 
to announce new restrictions 
to curb the spread of COVID-19 
as statewide cases skyrocket, 
breaking records. 

“We are in the worst moment of 

this pandemic to date,” Whitmer 
said at the rare weekend briefing, 
which occurred on short notice 
in response to alarming trends 
across the state. “The situation 
has never been more dire. We are 
at the precipice and we need to 
take some action. As the weather 
gets colder and people spend 
more time indoors, this virus 
will spread. More people will 

get sick and there will be more 
fatalities.”

The new rules from MDHHS 

— which mandate colleges end 
in-person classes — change very 
little for the University, which is 
already almost entirely remote. 
However, it marks the final blow 
to the school’s effort to partially 
reopen for the fall semester. 

After 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan released plans for the 
winter 
semester 
incorporating 

more significant measures to 
mitigate COVID-19 spread on 
campus, the Graduate Employees’ 
Organization 
told 
leaders, 

including 
University 
President 

Mark Schlissel, to give credit 
where it is due and acknowledge 
that they asked for these measures 
when they went on strike in 
September. 

“Cite your sources President 

Schlissel,” the union wrote in a 
tweet responding to Schlissel’s 
announcement for the winter 
semester. 

The 
Graduate 
Employees’ 

Organization went on strike for 
two weeks at the beginning of the 
semester, advocating for improved 
protocol 
to 
manage 
COVID-

19 such as widespread testing 
and 
accommodating 
Graduate 

Student 
Instructors 
who 
are 

not comfortable with teaching 
in-person. 

After Schlissel threatened to 

sue the organization, the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization accepted 
an offer that members felt failed 

to meet many of their demands 
regarding 
a 
safer 
pandemic 

response, cutting ties with law 
enforcement 
and 
improving 

employee childcare services. 

However, GEO Vice President 

Erin Markiewitz said she sees 
some of their previous demands 
reflected in the University’s winter 
plan 
despite 
the 
University’s 

failure to give recognition. In 
particular, 
improved 
testing 

capacity and more remote class 
options are two aspects of the 
University’s winter plan that the 
GEO also had on their agenda. 

“In 
an 
early 
town 
hall, 

President Schlissel said something 
along the lines of: our plan can’t 
be 
substandard 
because 
no 

standard for a COVID plan exists,” 
Markiewitz said. 

“When GEO pointed to other 

peer institutions as examples 
of what an adequate pandemic 
response plan would look like, 
for instance Cornell, they said, 
‘Well, they’re not the standard.’ 
If there was never a standard, 
then why does the new plan seem 
to be closer to the standard that 
activists pointed towards earlier 
this semester?”

A high school senior’s fall is 

typically marked by road trips 
to college campuses, waking up 
early on the weekends to take 
standardized tests and rushing 
to finish an endless stream of 
essays by Halloween. Throw in a 
global pandemic and everything 
changes.

The University of Michigan has 

made a number of key changes to 
the college application process this 
year. Most notably, the University 
has adopted a “test-flexible” policy 
and extended the early action 
deadline two weeks. Early action 
applications are now due Nov. 15 
as opposed to the traditional Nov. 
1 cutoff.

Because of the pandemic, this 

year’s application cycle will look 
different 
for 
both 
applicants 

and the admissions department. 
The Michigan Daily talked to 

high 
school 
seniors, 
college 

admissions counselors and U-M 
administrators 
to 
understand 

what it’s like to be a high school 
senior applying to the University 
of Michigan this year.

Test-flexible policy leaves 

some relieved, but others with 
questions

In 
July, 
the 
University 

announced it would transition 
to a “test-flexible” policy for 
the upcoming application cycle, 
which allows students to submit 
standardized test scores other 
than the ACT or SAT, such as 
the PSAT, PLAN or AP exams. 
The University will also accept 
self-reported scores given that 
students submit official scores by 
the end of the enrollment process.

The 
policy 
still 
strongly 

encourages applicants to submit a 
test score, but increases flexibility 
in the method of reporting and the 
type of exam. If a student is unable 
to take a test altogether, they can 
still be considered for admittance. 

Several high school seniors 

expressed relief in response to 
the more accommodating testing 
policy. Roy Huang, a senior at 
St. Andrews College in Ontario, 
Canada, will be applying early-
action without a test score. 
He said he felt relieved by the 
flexible policy after all Canadian 
Scholastic Aptitude Test dates 
were canceled.

“(The new policy) reduces a 

lot of the anxiety around getting 
a test date and needing to keep 
on studying for the SAT,” Huang 
said. “Now, I can focus more on 
supplements and writing the 
common app essay.” 

Not all seniors reacted as 

positively to the flexible policy. 
Catherine Hwang, a senior at 
Forest Hills Northern High School 
in Grand Rapids, Mich., said 
the University should consider 
adopting 
a 
“test-optional” 

policy 
instead. 
Test-optional 

policies, which do not require 
or encourage submitting test 

scores, are endorsed by other peer 
institutions, such as New York 
University.

“There’s definitely potential 

for (the University) to be test-
optional,” Hwang said. “I think 
that NYU and (the University) fall 
under the same competitiveness 
when you look at their acceptance 
rates, so (the University) could 
provide some other options for 
students.” 

Students 
and 
high 
school 

counselors expressed confusion 
about what exactly a “test-flexible” 
policy entails.

Laura 
Hollyer-Madis 
and 

Norman 
Hurns, 
high 
school 

counselors from the Bloomfield 
Hills, Mich., and Birmingham, 
Mich., school districts respectively, 
shared similar frustrations over 
the ambiguity of whether or not 
admissions officers will expect 
test scores. Hollyer-Madis equated 
the policy to a “moving target.”

This was more difficult for 

students who had already left 
due to the two-week stay at home 
order issued in late October. 

LSA freshman Dora Usdan, 

who moved back home earlier in 
November, plans to live in an off-
campus apartment next semester 
with her roommate.

“But we just had to sign the 

lease on an apartment that we’d 
never seen before because we’re 
not in Ann Arbor,” Usdan said. “It 
was really stressful because even 
as I was on the phone with real 
estate agents, I’d be looking at a 
property and the agent would say, 
‘Someone just signed that lease 
30 seconds ago in my office, it’s 
gone.’”

Many students left during the 

stay-in-place order because they 
were offered partial housing 
refunds if they moved out by Nov. 
3. 

LSA freshman Sara Stawarz 

was one of them. She said she 
didn’t expect the situation in Ann 

Arbor to change so rapidly while 
she was gone.

“It’s been kind of stressful 

because I left with the knowledge 
that I would be coming back next 
semester and that this wouldn’t 
be the last that I’d see of my 
friends until August, which is the 
situation now,” Stawarz said. 

For some out-of-state students, 

leaving early during the two-
week stay-in-place period has left 
them in a difficult situation now 
that they cannot return to their 
dorms next semester. 

The 
University 
has 

recommended 
two 
options: 

returning to campus to empty 
out their rooms themselves, or 
hiring John’s Pack & Ship moving 
company at a minimum cost of 
$500 to do it for them and mail or 
store the belongings. 

In an email to The Michigan 

Daily, 
University 
Housing 

spokesperson Amir Baghdadchi 
wrote students are allowed to 
sign up for a time slot to return 
to campus and pack up their 
belongings. The dates for move 
out range between Nov. 30 and 
Dec. 6. If necessary, students 
may also move out after Dec. 6 

and before the start of winter 
semester if arranged ahead of 
time with University Housing. 

“We understand moving out 

can be a challenge, and we’re 
ready to be flexible and offer 
students options,” Baghdadchi 
said.

LSA freshman Nadir Gerber 

is at his permanent residence 
in 
California 
and 
reached 

out to Housing to explain his 
predicament. 

“I did mention that I was in 

California so it wasn’t feasible for 
me to come out and pick things 
up from my dorm and their first 
recommendation was that I come 
out and pick things up from the 
dorm myself,” Gerber said. “I am 
potentially looking at flying back 
out to Michigan and just getting 
everything myself, but doing that 
while I’m still trying to attend 
class is not only a huge financial 
commitment but also really gets 
in the way of my schooling.”

Usdan, who had moved back 

home to New York, said this was 
an 
unreasonable 
expectation 

for students and their families, 
saying students essentially have 
two choices: “Com(ing) back with 

their parents who are more at risk 
to pick up their stuff or paying a 
really high fee.” 

“That’s super inconvenient and 

they didn’t tell me to move out 
all my stuff when I left Oct. 24,” 
Usdan said.

Baghdadchi also wrote that 

students are able to authorize 
someone 
to 
pick 
up 
their 

belongings on their behalf if they 
are unable to do so themselves. 
He wrote that the best option for 
some students may be to use a 
third party to pack, store or ship 
items, and they are able to use 
John’s Pack & Ship to do so.

Students who want to remain in 

the residence halls next semester 
can apply for an exception. 
Stawarz said she felt the space 
allotted to tell the University why 
she should stay was insufficient 
to get the message across. 

“I had to write them in 500 

characters or less, why for my 
mental health I should go back,” 
Stawarz said. “It was so hard to 
get the full scope of the issue in 
500 characters, and I genuinely 
am afraid that they won’t take me 
back.”

Several 
students 
have 

expressed 
disappointment 

with the University’s response 
to 
COVID-19 
this 
semester, 

attributing the closing of the 
residence halls to a lack of 
preparedness and a shortage of 
testing availability. 

Stawarz said she wishes the 

University 
had 
tested 
more 

students earlier in the semester 
before the stay-in-place order 
was implemented.

“It’s 
pretty 
disappointing, 

especially knowing that all of this 
could’ve been prevented if they 
had just done weekly testing. 
They let it go way too far and only 
implemented these things when 
it was unimaginable for them to 
not do so,” Stawarz said. 

As part of the University’s 

plan for the winter semester, 
testing capacity will be increased 
to about 12,000 to 15,000 tests 
per week. According to the plan, 
students living in University 
Housing 
or 
participating 
in 

on-campus activities in winter 
2021 will also be tested on a 
regular basis. 

Over 
the 
summer, 
the 

University’s Board of Regents 
voted to increase tuition and 

increase room and board fees by 
1.9% in the 2020-2021 budget, 
despite receiving backlash from 
the 
campus 
community 
for 

raising tuition during a global 
pandemic. This was in response 
to a projected University budget 
deficit due to COVID-19.

Other 
students 
said 
they 

were more concerned about the 
prospect of paying full tuition for 
the winter semester while going 
to school online and living at 
home. LSA freshman Yitzi Zolty 
said he wonders what students 
are paying for when the capacity 
for campus learning is so limited.

“I doubt this was a decision 

that was made overnight — 
there’s nothing wrong with full 
transparency,” Zolty said. “I 
think the main thing, at least 
on my mind, is that we’re still 
paying full tuition as out-of-
state students, and part of their 
spending plan is to upkeep 
facilities. But if none of those are 
going to be in use, why are we 
paying so much?”

Hurns agreed, saying different 
U-M representatives and sources 
have stressed the importance of 
including test scores differently. 

“Originally, they were saying, 

‘Well, we want to see something, 
even an AP score, a PSAT score, 
something,’” Madis said. “And 
then the last presentation I saw, 
it seemed to be leaning more 
towards test-optional. So, I’m not 
exactly sure (what the University 
wants).”

In response to concerns over 

how the University would fairly 
evaluate applicants without test 
scores, Erica Sanders, director of 
undergraduate admissions at the 
University, said in an email to The 
Daily that no individual student 
would be at a disadvantage in the 
admissions process. 

“As is the case every cycle, each 

student is evaluated individually 
and holistically,” Sanders wrote. 

“We do not compare individual 
students to each other.”

New deadline allows more 

time to perfect application

Though 
students 
expressed 

mixed feelings about the changes 
to the testing policy, seniors and 
administrators were generally in 
favor of the extended Nov. 15 early 
action deadline. With the new 
deadline, early action applicants 
are guaranteed an admissions 
decision of accept, reject or 
deferral to the regular decision 
pool by late January, about a 
month later than previous years.

Despite admissions decisions 

being delayed to January, Riley 
Hodder, a senior at Oxford High 
School in Oxford, Mich., said the 
extended application deadline has 
allowed her to devote her efforts 
after Nov. 1 entirely to her U-M 
application. 

“It was a major benefit to be 

able to put off U-M for a few days 
and focus on (other applications) 
that needed to get done,” Hodder 

said. 

According to The Wall Street 

Journal, the Common Application, 
which is used by the University 
and more than 900 other schools, 
saw 8% less first-year applications 
and 10% fewer applicants through 
Nov. 2 compared to the same 
period last year.

Some 
high 
school 

administrators, including Ann 
Arbor Public Schools counselor 
Christopher Kasper, said they 
felt 
concerned 
the 
extended 

deadline 
would 
encourage 

students to procrastinate on their 
applications.

However, Groves High School 

Counselor Lilianne Kowalchuk 
did 
not 
anticipate 
students 

would delay working on their 
applications more than usual. 
Kowalchuk has recommended her 
students treat the additional two 
weeks like a “safety net.” 

She said she wants them to have 

their applications completely done 
by Nov. 1 and to use the extra time 

to double-check that everything 
has been properly submitted and 
received by the University.

“The kids who procrastinate 

are going to procrastinate no 
matter what,” Kowalchuk said.

Pandemic causes students to 

consider college options closer to 
home

The lack of physical college 

visits, admissions tours and other 
traditional recruiting events have 
further affected the information 
students have access to as they 
determine which college is right 
for them. 

Anna Partalis, a senior at 

Bloomfield Hills High School in 
Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said even 
though she is applying to several 
out-of-state 
universities, 
the 

University remains her top choice 
due to the pandemic’s cancellation 
of campus visits.

“I feel like if I were able to 

do in-person tours, I would be 
more attached to other out-of-
state schools,” Partalis said. “The 

experience for students in person 
is really important to me, so I feel 
like I’m definitely more attached 
to my in-state schools.” 

Nosheen 
Ahmed, 
a 
senior 

at Niles North High School in 
Skokie, Ill., said while she had 
previously wanted to go out-of-
state for college, both financial 
issues and the possibility of the 
University still being virtual for 
the Fall 2021 semester have made 
her strongly consider in-state 
options. Ahmed said though she is 
still applying to the University, the 
ongoing pandemic has brought 
new factors into the equation of 
deciding where to attend.

“(The University is) switching 

to online school and restricting 
the dorm options, but they’re not 
lowering tuition, and that doesn’t 
make sense to me,” Ahmed said. 
“My mom was at risk of losing her 
job, and we’re going to have three 
kids in college (next year), so I just 
don’t want that financial burden.” 

University promotes holistic 

evaluation of applications, with 
concessions 
for 
COVID-19-

related setbacks

With 
diverse 
grading 

systems, inconsistent access to 
standardized tests and mental 
health 
challenges 
posed 
by 

COVID-19, the U-M admissions 
office, known for its selective 
acceptance 
process, 
faces 

unprecedented 
challenges 
as 

they decide who they will grant 
admission to for the Class of 2025. 
The University accepted 26.1% — 
approximately 17,000 out of more 
than 65,000 for a 6,900-student 
class — for the Class of 2024.

Sanders said she is optimistic 

about the admissions department’s 
ability to contextually review a 
student’s application and consider 
any external factors that may 
affect how that student appears 
on paper.

“We 
have 
expanded 
our 

capacity in a number of ways,” 
Dickson said. “We converted 
what was recently a moderate 
care unit into a fully functional 
ICU, we have put additional ICU 
physicians on the service and 
we have provided additional 
training 
for 
moderate 
care 

nurses to provide critical care to 
patients.”

As cases continue to rise and 

hospitals continue to prepare, 
some 
specialty 
hospitals 
in 

Southeast Michigan have begun 
to offer their extra space to major 
health systems. On top of this, 
some non-health care businesses 
have also begun to offer space for 
low-acuity patients. 

‘We 
never 
stopped 
our 

preparation and planning’

Compared 
to 
the 
spring, 

Dickson said Michigan Medicine 

is more prepared now for a rise 
in cases. 

“We’re more prepared because 

we’ve seen this movie before,” 
Dickson said. “We didn’t know 
what to expect in March really, 
at that point all we had were 
anecdotes from our colleagues 
in Asia and Europe. By now 
we have a luxury of lots and 
lots of experience, randomized 
controlled trials and rigorously 
done observational studies.” 

Michigan 
Medicine 
has 

also gained specific medical 
knowledge in the past months 
of the pandemic that will help 
the hospital provide better care 
to COVID-19 patients, Dickson 
said. 

“I think we’re smarter about 

what not to do as much as we 
are smarter about what to do,” 
Dickson said. “I do think one 
thing we learned over and over, 
is that more important than 
any given drug for COVID, is 
outstanding meticulous evidence 

based critical care practices.” 

Jeffery 
Desmond, 
chief 

medical officer of Michigan 
Medicine, 
said 
Michigan 

Medicine 
never 
stopped 

preparing for a rise in cases. 

“We 
never 
stopped 
our 

preparation 
and 
planning,” 

Desmond said. “Even when we 
were on that plateau during the 
summer and early fall.” 

Desmond also said Michigan 

Medicine 
has 
been 
at 
the 

forefront of preparations and 
use of new knowledge since the 
beginning of the pandemic. 

“We were one of the early 

hospitals in the country to 
require masks for everyone in 
the hospital,” Desmond said. 
“We did that because we felt the 
data was suggestive that it would 
be protective for our employees 
and for our patients … and it 
turns out universal use of masks 
really provides protection for 
employees and for patients.” 

This moment in the pandemic 

is also different, Desmond said, 
because 
Michigan 
Medicine 

is continuing to treat regular 
patients 
and 
COVID-19 

patients, which they didn’t do 
in the spring because of Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer’s executive 
orders restricting nonessential 
treatment.

“We have reverted back to 

more normal care,” Desmond 
said. “Now, we’re in the midst of 
managing COVID patients and 
non-COVID care simultaneously 
in the hospital.” 

However, Desmond said he 

believes Michigan Medicine is 
more than capable of rising to 
this challenge. 

Desmond also said Michigan 

Medicine has recently been able 
to somewhat recover from the 
poor financial performance of 
the summer and early fall. He 
said the hospital system has 
been able to reinstate retirement 
match 
and 
professional 

development funding.

Nursing sophomore Britney 

Nguyen agreed with Desmond 
and Dickson, noting that there is a 
more widespread understanding 
of how the pandemic should be 
handled now than there was last 
spring. 

“I think we’re more prepared,” 

Nguyen said. “I think everyone 
just being on the same page with 
the pandemic has really helped 
and just getting a University-
wide consensus on what steps we 
need to be taking.” 

Health care workers ask 

students 
to 
follow 
public 

health guidelines

Both students and medical 

professionals in Ann Arbor said 
they see the role students can 
play in slowing the spread of 
COVID-19 — and are asking them 
to remain vigilant as cases rise.

Nursing senior Joyce Lee 

wrote in an email to The 
Michigan Daily that nursing 
students have had to be open 
to changes while completing 

clinical hours in the hospital. 

“As a nursing student we 

have to be flexible in general 
and 
especially 
during 
a 

pandemic,” Lee wrote. “As with 
most students, most formats 
are virtual, and clinical are 
in-person. For one of my clinicals 
I am a contact tracer and there 
have been moments of more 
contacts at certain points.” 

Hyzy also said it is important 

for students to be safe and make 
good decisions to mitigate the 
spread of the virus. 

“I would implore your readers 

to be good citizens,” Hyzy said. 
“You might get by with a milder 
case of COVID but … people 
are dying and more people will 
die, though admittedly fewer 
than the spring. But this is very 
serious stuff. And I’m telling 
you, it’s starting to really take off 
again.”

University President Mark 

Schlissel and Provost Susan 
Collins wrote in a Monday 
email to the campus community 
that the University would shift 
all 
coursework, 
except 
any 

associated with training medical 
professionals, to be conducted 
remotely to follow the state’s 
guidelines. This only affects the 
three days before Thanksgiving 
break. 

Previously, 
under 
the 

University’s initial plan, all 
undergraduate 
classes 
were 

scheduled to go fully remote 
after the holiday through the 
end of the semester on Dec. 18, 
but the state order shortened 
that timeline. 

“Over 
the 
past 
several 

months, we have been asked to 
continually adjust our activities 
to help protect the health and 
safety of the larger community,” 
Schlissel and Collins wrote. 
“We know this will cause some 
disruptions in a few courses 
and labs that were meeting in 
person through Friday – and we 
appreciate everyone’s continued 
diligence 
and 
resilience 
as 

we work to slow the spread of 
COVID-19.”

The 
state’s 
three-week 

epidemic order is not the first 
time the school’s operations have 
faced significant disruptions in 
an effort to curb the spread of 
the virus. Administrators have 
had to switch gears several 
times over the semester to deal 
with unforeseen circumstances 
stemming from the pandemic, 
ranging from lockdowns to labor 
disputes.

Schlissel started off the year 

on an optimistic note, saying in 
August, “I think it’s more likely 
than not that we will make it 
through the semester,” even as 
other colleges reversed course 
on their reopening plans. 

The choice to move forward 

with 
reopening 
sparked 

criticism from students, staff 
and faculty, who complained 
about the lack of testing and 
called 
for 
more 
stringent 

restrictions regarding campus 
operations. 

“It’s 
not 
realistic 
that 

students are going to come back 
on campus and not bring COVID 
with them and spread it amongst 
themselves,” Rackham student 
Gabby Sarpy said at a protest in 
August. 

The semester began with 

about 78% of classes taught 
remotely, 
but 
outbreaks 
on 

campus 
in 
September 
and 

October prompted Washtenaw 
County to issue a stay-in-
place order for undergraduate 
students on Oct. 20. The order 
carved out several exceptions 
for students, including attending 
class. 

Courses 
that 
were 

significantly 
enhanced 
by 

in-person 
learning 
did 
not 

have 
to 
move 
to 
remote 

instruction under the county’s 
October order. According to 
the University Record, 90% of 
undergraduate courses are now 
being taught remotely. 

Students raised doubts about 

the stay-in-place order, even 
calling it a targeted “anti-party 
ordinance.” The order, however, 
seemed to work. When it was 
first issued, COVID-19 cases 
associated with the University 
represented more than 60% of 
local cases. Two weeks later, 
University students accounted 
for about a third of cases in the 
county. 

According to Schlissel, the 

University saw an “unacceptable 
level 
of 
COVID-19 
cases” 

among undergraduates, both 

on campus and off. He said 
the 
experience 
pushed 
the 

University to shift away from 
the model used for fall. 

Now, the plan for winter will 

offer increased testing, and no 
instructor will be required to 
teach in person. Residence halls 
will be closed to students who 
do not present a compelling 
need to stay on campus. 

Many of the components 

of the winter plan align with 
demands voiced by the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization earlier 
in the semester when Graduate 
Student Instructors went on 
strike.

“In some ways, it feels like 

the admin has come to their 
senses, but really I think this 
was 
a 
calculated 
business 

decision — ‘We were willing 
to risk community safety to 
maintain tuition and housing 
revenue, but doing that hurt us 
so we’re shifting course,’” GEO 
member Dom Bouavichith said 
in a previous interview with 
The Daily.

In 
addition 
to 
graduate 

students, residential advisers 
went on strike due to the 
working conditions in residence 
halls. Some dining hall staff 
also spoke out in protest of the 

University’s handling of the 
reopening. 

The pandemic also threw 

a wrench in the University’s 
research 
apparatus. 
The 

University placed nonessential 
research largely on hold in 
March. 
Activities 
slowly 

ramped up throughout the 
year, with adjustments made 
for large spikes in cases in the 
community. 

At the start of the school year, 

only senior students already 
trained 
in 
their 
respective 

research could resume work in 
person, but by mid-October, all 
undergraduates were allowed 
to 
participate 
again. 
The 

county’s 
stay-in-place 
order 

limited research activities for 
undergraduates shortly after 
they were allowed to return, 
leaving many students feeling as 
though they were back at square 
one. 

While the state’s new rules 

do not limit the University’s 
research, Schlissel and Collins 
noted 
they 
would 
adjust 

operation policies out of an 
excess of caution. Research 
laboratories will continue to 
operate at 60% density, and 
undergraduate 
students 
can 

still help out with in-person 

research. 

However, 
according 
to 
a 

Monday 
update 
from 
Vice 

President of Research Rebecca 
Cunningham, certain human 
research studies “should prepare 
to pause in-person activity” 
with research participants by 
Friday at the latest.

Cunningham also noted that 

12 researchers who had been 
working in person have tested 
positive for COVID-19 in the 
past seven days. 

As cases continue to rise 

across 
the 
state, 
Michigan 

Medicine 
is 
preparing 
for 

another rise in hospitalizations. 

“We’re 
more 
prepared 

because we’ve seen this movie 
before,” said Robert Dickson, 
associate professor of medicine 
in the Division of Pulmonary 
and Critical Care Medicine. “We 
didn’t know what to expect in 
March really, at that point all 
we had were anecdotes from our 
colleagues in Asia and Europe. By 
now we have a luxury of lots and 
lots of experience, randomized 
controlled trials and rigorously 
done observational studies.”

Graduate 
student 
Jeffrey 

Grim’s last moments with his 
grandparents 
consisted 
of 

Zoom calls and waiting outside 
their room in the hospital. 
Despite following public health 
guidelines, 
both 
of 
Grim’s 

grandparents, Jacob and Doris 
Bender, contracted COVID-19 
this summer. 

“The hardest part was not 

being able to do anything,” Grim 
said.

Doris and Jacob, who worked 

in the Army, married in 1958 
after meeting in Hawaii . They 
moved to Jacob’s hometown, 
Sharpsburg, Md., where Doris 
worked in a hair salon and 
Jacob 
worked 
for 
Jamison 

Door 
Company. 
Doris 
also 

became a small-time celebrity 
for crocheting more than 2,000 
hats for newborns. The residents 
from Sharpsburg remembered 
the couple as always willing to 
lend a hand.

This summer, both of Grim’s 

grandparents died two days 
apart from each other, separated 
by two rooms. 

Grim 
is 
one 
of 
many 

Americans 
experiencing 
loss 

from the coronavirus pandemic. 
More 
than 
230,000 
people 

have died from COVID-19, with 
researchers projecting another 
180,000 deaths by Jan. 1. 

While 
both 
of 
Grim’s 

grandparents were in their 80s, 
they had differing preexisting 
conditions: 
asthma 
and 

prior heart damage for his 
grandmother 
and 
recovery 

from prostate cancer for his 
grandfather. Grim said both 
of his grandparents had to be 
hospitalized as their conditions 
worsened. 

Patients 
who 
contract 

COVID-19 
have 
extremely 

limited physical contact with 
close family, where the only 

form of contact allowed is calling 
through a mobile device. Grim 
recounts using Zoom to have 
15-minute interactions with his 
grandparents, even if they were 
sedated. 

This form of contact included 

a 
sobering 
interaction 
in 

which Grim had to say his 
final goodbyes to both of his 
grandparents.

On college campuses, images 

of college students partying 
without wearing a mask or social 
distancing have been prevalent. 
LSA 
sophomore 
Junhyoung 

Kwon said he thinks people aren’t 
taking the pandemic seriously 
due to lack of understanding of 
COVID-19 and the consequences 
of contracting the virus. 

“If you hear about other 

people getting affected, that 
doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll 
be able to … sympathize with 
it unless it actually happens to 
you,” Kwon said.

Centers for Disease Control 

and Prevention guidelines to 
combat the virus include wearing 
a mask and social distancing at 
least six feet apart, but these 
recommendations 
have 
been 

ignored by some individuals.

Grim said he feels outraged 

when he sees people without 
masks or not adhering to the 
CDC 
guidelines 
to 
combat 

COVID-19.

“If 
there’s 
someone 
not 

wearing a mask, I think it’s just 
so selfish, because it’s people like 
that that probably spread it to my 
grandparents,” Grim said. “And 
so, for people to think, ‘I’m not 
going to be hurt by it,’ that’s not 
necessarily true … you could pass 
it on to other people, especially 
people 
who 
are 
working, 

especially older people, and it’s 
just really selfish.”

People 
who 
show 
no 

symptoms may not feel the 
detrimental effects of COVID-19 
but can still spread it to others. 
People who are asymptomatic 
may not know if they have been 

infected, and wearing a mask 
regardless of showing symptoms 
can prevent others from getting 
infected. 

LSA sophomore Sally Hwang 

said she knows several people 
who have tested positive for the 
virus.

“It is so heartbreaking and 

sad that there’s nothing you can 
really do besides wait it out,” 
Hwang said.

Despite 
the 
increasing 

number of students on campus 
testing positive for COVID-19, 
Hwang expresses her frustration 
when some students continue to 
downplay the threat of the virus. 

“I hear people outside of 

this apartment partying every 
single night next door and in 
the building next to us,” Hwang 
said. “It’s really disappointing, 
because it honestly seems like 
there’s not a lot of people taking 
it seriously on campus, and I 
really just feel like that brings 
the reputation of the school 
down.”

Grim, who is in his sixth year 

as a doctoral candidate, notes 
how his school life has been 
impacted after the deaths of his 
grandparents.

“Besides 
impacting 
my 

family’s 
life 
and 
my 
life 

significantly, it’s made it really 
hard to do school work. It makes 
it really hard to work on my 
dissertation,” Grim said.

Grim said he hopes his story 

will motivate others to take the 
consequences of the pandemic 
seriously.

“I really hope that from me 

and my family sharing our story 
about losing two really important 
people, that maybe it might 
personalize things for others so 
that they take better care, if not 
for themselves but for others,” 
Grim said. “I would do anything 
(to have) my grandmother back.”

As protesters took to the 

streets across the nation to fight 
police brutality and systemic 
racism in the name of Black 
Lives Matter this year, calls for 
the abolishment of not only the 
police but the larger criminal 
justice 
system 
have 
gained 

momentum. 
The 
Michigan 

Daily spoke with currently and 
formerly 
incarcerated 
people 

about their experiences in prison 
and what the future of criminal 
justice should look like.

Parallels between slavery 

and the modern prison system

Dion “Bantu” Dawson, who 

is 
currently 
incarcerated 
in 

Macomb Correctional Facility 
in Michigan, has been in prison 
for 18 years with a sentence 
of natural life without the 
possibility of parole. He is the 
president of the Macomb Prison 
branch of the NAACP. Dawson 
said prisons are “designed to 
contain and control the Black 
body.”

Further, 
Dawson 
drew 

parallels between slavery and 
the prison system today, calling it 
a “modern-day slave plantation.”

“There is almost an identical 

system in place as it relates to 
property relations between the 
prisoner and the prisoner state 
just as it was the slave and the 
slave master,” Dawson said.

Dawson said there is an 

inherent 
violence 
in 
both 

systems, 
with 
violence 
so 

common that it has become 
normalized. In his time at 
Macomb and previously at Ionia 
Correctional Facility, Dawson 
said he’s seen fellow inmates 
beaten, suffocated and chained 
to their beds.

“Both systems naturalize the 

violence that they impose on 
their subjects,” Dawson said. 
“Prison staff, for example, find it 
almost impossible not to subject 
us to violence in the form of 
threats. They have to always 
instill this fear in us.”

Dawson also found similarities 

between the aggression he’s 
experienced in prison and police 
brutality today. 

“Just like Black men and 

women today are being subjected 
to police brutality, we are very 
much subjected to brutality 
as well by the correctional 
officers,” Dawson said. 

He also noted prison staff 

feel a strong allegiance to their 
fellow staff, which can lead 
to increased intimidation and 
violence against prisoners –– a 
phenomenon also seen during 
recent BLM protests and the 
trials of police officers.

The illusion of autonomy in 

prison

Lacino 
Hamilton, 
who 

was released from prison in 
September after being wrongly 
convicted 
of 
murdering 
his 

foster mother, said he had very 
little autonomy to make his own 
choices. He was incarcerated for 
26 years. 

“It 
was 
dehumanizing 

in the sense that it (prison) 
micromanages down to a point 
where 
there’s 
no 
necessity 

for thought,” Hamilton said. 
“Everything is pre-programmed, 
all decisions are stripped away.” 

Another inmate at Macomb, 

Gregory 
Tyrone 
Alexander, 

who has been incarcerated for 
23 years with a life sentence 
without 
parole, 
echoed 

Hamilton’s thoughts and said 
autonomy in prison is an illusion. 

“There’s 
a 
way 
to 
make 

those who are being controlled 
believe that we are somewhat in 
control, and so we go about our 
daily existence thinking that 
the choices we make are solely 
ours, but all along there is an 
invisible hand who dictates our 
movement, even our thought 
process,” Alexander said. 

Alexander said even his family 

on the outside has experienced 
small doses of the control the 
criminal justice system exerts 
— for example, when they call 
for information or when they try 
to send him material items for 
support. 

“There always seemed to be 

a block, an obstacle, that had 
to be traversed,” Alexander 
said. “What they think to be 
a simple gesture of support or 
love was always blocked or put 
some type of resistance on, so 
as I said before, there’s a sense 
of control which is somewhat 
subtly applied to those who are 
constantly within the system. 
But for them (family on the 
outside), since they don’t witness 
it on a daily basis, when they 
do experience it, it’s almost 
shocking.”

The current movement for 

abolition

While 
there 
may 
be 

similarities between the carceral 
state and slavery, Hamilton said 
it is not a productive comparison 
and does not help modern day 
social justice movements gain 
momentum. 

The prison system is violent 

not because of the physical 
violence 
people 
experience 

inside, but because it violently 
isolates 
inmates 
from 
their 

communities, 
according 
to 

Hamilton. 

“Prison is inherently violent 

because it is a separation of a 

person from their family, their 
community,” 
Hamilton 
said. 

“That’s 
violent. 
Everything 

about it in that sense, so 
everybody in prison experiences 
violence.”

Alexander 
addressed 
the 

racism he experienced growing 
up in Battle Creek. At first, he 
said he didn’t recognize the 
systemic racism he faced, but 
his perspective changed once he 
was incarcerated. 

“When 
(racism) 
is 
subtly 

applied, I think psychologically 
we have a tendency to dismiss 
it and almost are able to argue 
that it is non-existent, and that 
was my stance for a long time,” 
Alexander said. “However, when 
I started to be involved in the 
criminal justice system, which 
started before being imprisoned, 
I was able to then understand 
how race played a major role in 
the trajectory of not only myself 
but those who look like me and 
so, experience life differently 
than what others experience.”

Calls to abolish the police 

and the prison system gained 
traction over the summer, as 
opposed to previous notions of 
reforming the carceral state. 

Dawson referred to reform as 

“window-dressing” and said it 
would not solve the problems. 
Abolition is the only solution, he 
said.

“(Abolition) isn’t just about 

tearing structures down, but 
also talking about building new 
structures up,” Dawson said. “So 
in that way, I think abolition is 
about imagining a new world, a 
more equitable world that isn’t 
just about caging people.”

Hamilton 
also 
expressed 

support 
of 
the 
abolition 

movement –– he said prisons 
were designed to be “inherently 
racist” and to make a profit, and 
they are achieving that goal.

“I think a lot of times when we 

say a system is broke, it means 
it’s not benefiting someone,” 
Hamilton said. “It’s broke, it’s not 
working. I think that (the prison 
system) only exists because 
it benefits someone … I think 

it is doing exactly what it was 
designed to do, regardless of the 
harm it does to communities.”

Alexander said, because of the 

stigma around being currently 
or formerly incarcerated, most 
people do not take the time to 
really listen to what inmates 
have to say, but he encouraged 
people to take it upon themselves 
to do their own research and 
find the “answers that are often 
not given freely.”

“Incarcerated 
women 
and 

men should not be identified 
by probably one of the worst 
mistakes they’ve ever made, 
which is sometimes just a bad 
decision, which we are often 
identified by,” Alexander said. 
“We 
are 
labeled 
generally, 

instead of individually, because 
we are grouped as convicted 
felons, and we are the group 
of society that no one wants to 
understand.”

student visas, Michigan Attorney 
General Dana Nessel co-signed a 
letter with 21 other state attorneys 
general opposing the policy. 

In a Friday press release, Nessel 

condemned the proposed rule and 
said the suggested timeline was 
unrealistic. 

“For decades we have allowed 

international students to remain 
in the U.S. until their studies are 
completed, and this proposed rule 
shows a blatant disregard for the 
positive impacts these students 
have on our economy and our 
cultural diversity,” Nessel said in 
a statement. “The reality for many 
students is that obtaining a college 
degree may not happen within four 
years, so to propose a rule which 
could limit that achievement and 
stifle the value of a culturally 
enriched experience within our 
universities is damaging to the 
U.S.’s reputation as a world leader.” 

This follows multiple other 

possible policy changes for these 
visas from earlier this year. In 
July, the Trump administration 
tried to limit visas by requiring 
new international students to 
take in-person classes to stay 
in the country, despite the fact 
that most universities, including 
the University of Michigan, had 
moved classes online because of 
the COVID-19 pandemic. After 
multiple lawsuits, the policy was 
rescinded. 

If 
enacted, 
the 
proposed 

rule would significantly limit 
international student visas, most 
dramatically for students from 59 
countries. Four of these countries 
— Iran, North Korea, Sudan and 
Syria — are included based on 
claims from the Department of 
Homeland Security that their 
governments are state sponsors of 
terrorism. The others are included 

largely due to visa overstay rates 
of more than 10% from last year’s 
DHS report, with 36 of these 
countries being in Sub-Saharan 
Africa. 

It would also limit the time for 

which student visas are active, 
making them apply for only two- 
or four-year fixed terms, both for 
under and post-grad programs. 
As with U.S.-born students, many 
international students take longer 
than 2-to-4 years to complete their 
education. 

According to the letter from the 

Attorney General’s Office, 53.2% of 
all international students, of which 
there are more than 700,000 in 
total, were enrolled in bachelor’s 
or Ph.D. programs in 2018 with a 
minimum duration of four years. 

Under the current policy, known 

as “duration of status,” students 
can generally stay in the U.S. for 
as long as necessary to complete 
their 
educational 
program, 

assuming they remain enrolled 
at an accredited institution and 
are meeting general progress 
requirements toward a degree.

If the new policy is enacted, 

students will only be allowed 
exceptions 
to 
the 
rule 
for 

compelling 
academic 
reasons, 

documented medical illnesses or 
circumstances beyond students’ 
control. 

Engineering junior Tony Pan, 

an international student from 
mainland China, said the four-
year time limit was too short, as 
international students may face 
additional challenges in finishing 
their degree as quickly as U.S.-
based students, especially if they 
are not fluent in English. 

He said he has thought about 

pursuing a Ph.D. in robotics in 
the U.S. but does not know if 
that would be possible under 
this timeline, saying it would be 
impossible to complete meaningful 
research in that time frame. He 
added that international students 
also come from different cultural 
backgrounds.

“Many (international students) 

may not even have the exposure 
like a lot of American students had 
when they were in high school,” 
Pan said. “Maybe they wanted 
to explore (different subjects) for 
the first year … Also, I really want 
to mention: it takes a long time to 
adapt to any environment with 
culture shock.”

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, in a letter submitted to 
DHS and co-signed by Provost 
Susan 
Collins, 
opposed 
the 

proposed rule and asked for its 
withdrawal. 

Schlissel echoed claims that 

the 
timeline 
was 
unrealistic 

and said it should be up to the 
University to examine student 
progress. He wrote the proposed 
regulation represents a severe 
misunderstanding of how higher 
education in the U.S. works.

“All 
of 
our 
students, 

regardless of their country of 
citizenship, should have the same 
opportunities,” Schlissel wrote.

The University’s International 

Center submitted a similar letter 
on behalf of the University. 

The 
22 
attorneys 
general 

provided numerous reasons to 
abandon the proposed rule in 
their letter, arguing it could cause 
a sharp decline in international 
student 
enrollment, 
as 
only 

41% of students at U.S. colleges 
and universities complete their 
bachelor’s degree within four 
years. 

In his letter, Schlissel explained 

the importance of international 
students’ contributions to the U.S. 

“Although the United States 

long has been the top destination 
for 
international 
students, 

scholars and faculty, there has 
been a nationwide decline in their 
numbers over the past few years, 
and this proposed regulation 
would undoubtedly result in a 
further decline,” Schlissel wrote.

Three U-M professors to aid Biden-Harris transition 

Three 
University 
of 

Michigan 
professors 
and 

Obama administration alums 
will help President-elect Joe 
Biden transition to power in 
Washington, D.C. 

The 
group 
selected 
to 

evaluate 
various 
federal 

agencies and get them in line 
with the goals of the Biden 
administration is a who’s-
who of academics and former 
government 
officials. 
The 

Biden-Harris transition team 
announced the list on Tuesday.

Michael 
Barr, 
dean 
of 

the Ford School of Public 
Policy, previously served in 
the Department of Treasury 
as 
assistant 
secretary 
for 

financial 
institutions 
when 

President Barack Obama was 
in office. Barr will serve as a 
volunteer on the Department 
of the Treasury committee of 
the transition team. 

In 
a 
Sunday 
email 
to 

students, Barr congratulated 
Biden and Vice President-
elect Kamala Harris on their 
victory, calling it a historic 
moment for the country.

“I also think it is fair to say, 

that those who have worked 
with 
President-elect 
Biden, 

from 
across 
the 
political 

spectrum, whether or not they 
agree with him on policy or 
politics, view him as a person 
of great personal integrity, 

decency, 
and 
compassion,” 

Barr wrote.

Barr helped craft the Dodd-

Frank Wall Street Reform 
and 
Consumer 
Protection 

Act of 2010, a massive piece 
of 
financial 
reform 
and 

oversight legislation passed 
in the aftermath of the 2008 
financial crisis.

Before 
his 
Senate 

confirmation, Barr was also 
a member of the National 
Economic 
Council 
in 
the 

White House. Before that, Barr 
worked in former President 
Bill Clinton’s administration.

Barr researches and writes 

about 
issues 
in 
domestic 

and 
international 
financial 

regulation. 
He 
is 
also 
a 

professor at the Law School, 
where 
he 
taught 
financial 

regulation and international 
finance.

Betsey 
Stevenson, 
a 

professor 
of 
public 
policy 

and 
economics, 
will 
also 

help review operations at the 
Department of Treasury in a 
volunteer capacity.

In a press release Tuesday, 

the 
Biden-Harris 
campaign 

emphasized the diversity of 
the transition team, calling it 
one of the most diverse agency 
review teams in presidential 
transition history. 

“Of the hundreds of (agency 

review team) members to be 
announced, more than half 
are women, and approximately 
40 
percent 
represent 

communities 
historically 

underrepresented 
in 
the 

federal government, including 
people of color, people who 
identify 
as 
LGBTQ+, 
and 

people with disabilities,” the 
release reads. “The President-
elect and Vice President-elect 
are committed to building an 
administration that looks like 
America.”

In a 2018 panel at the Ford 

School, Stevenson discussed 
the need to diversify the field 
of economics, stressing the 
importance 
of 
increasing 

the number of women in the 
profession.

“We have a cultural shift 

that needs to take place,” 
Stevenson said. “And one of 
the few ways to get cultures 
to shift is to change the people 
in the culture, so I do think 
that improving the pipeline 
and getting more women into 
economics is an important 
part of this.”

Stevenson previously served 

as a member of the Council of 
Economic Advisers from 2013 
to 2015. She advised then-
President Obama on the labor 
market, social policy and trade 
issues. 

From 2010 to 2011, she was 

the chief economist of the U.S. 
Department of Labor, where 
she advised the Secretary of 
Labor on labor policy.

Law 
professor 
Barb 

McQuade will be a volunteer 
on the Department of Justice 
committee of the transition 
team. From 2010 to 2017, she 
was the U.S attorney for the 
Eastern District of Michigan, 

the first woman to serve in the 
role. 

McQuade 
was 
appointed 

by 
Obama 
and 
oversaw 

cases involving fraud, public 
corruption, terrorism and civil 
rights, among other issues. She 
resigned in March 2017 at the 
request of President Donald 
Trump.

McQuade 
has 
been 
a 

frequent critic of the Trump 
administration, accusing the 
current president of working 
to undermine the rule of law.

In a statement to The Daily, 

McQuade said she was excited 
to aid in the transition process.

“I am honored to be part of 

the Biden-Harris transition 
team and eager to help ensure 
a smooth transition at the 
Department of Justice,” she 
wrote.

The 
Associated 
Press 

declared Biden the winner 
of the presidential election 
on Saturday morning, and 
students took to State Street 
to celebrate. President Trump 
has refused to concede and his 
campaign has filed lawsuits 
challenging the validity of the 
election in numerous states, 
without citing evidence of 
fraud or wrongdoing.

On 
Monday, 
the 
Trump 

administration 
told 
agency 

officials 
not 
to 
cooperate 

with 
the 
Biden 
transition 

team, as the president has 
yet to concede the election. 
Various agency officials had 
previously prepared briefings 
and 
reserved 
office 
space 

for members of the Biden 
transition team. Instead, they 
are now being instructed to 
wait until the General Services 
Administration 
officially 

begins the transition to a 
Biden administration.

A controversial oil and gas 

pipeline in the Straits of Mackinac 
is losing its ability to operate on the 
bottom of the lake, Michigan Gov. 
Gretchen Whitmer announced 
Friday. 

Michigan’s 
Department 

of 
Natural 
Resources 
will 

terminate 
a 
1953 
easement 

agreement with Enbridge, the 
company traditionally supplying 
petroleum and natural gas to 
Mackinac Island. Whitmer said 
the company’s 67-year-old dual 
pipelines presented “unreasonable 
risk” to the state’s residents. 

Enbridge has repeatedly been 

criticized 
by 
environmental 

activists, who call for an end to 
the pipelines’ operation. These 
activists fear the pipeline could 
rupture, leading to a massive oil 
spill in a waterway that connects 
Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. 

The 
pipelines 
are 
subject 

to 
several 
other 
concerns, 

including allegations Enbridge 
has not complied with Michigan 
regulations 
and 
a 
lack 
of 

transparency during inspections. 
Supporters of Line 5 see it as an 
essential source of natural gas and 
propane for people in the Upper 
Peninsula and other parts of the 
state.

According to a Friday press 

release, 
Whitmer 
and 
DNR 

Director Dan Eichinger say the 
action is a result of a violation of 
the public trust doctrine, which 
requires Michigan to protect and 
preserve the shores of the Great 
Lakes. The termination is based 
on the company’s “persistent and 
incurable violations” of the terms 
and conditions of the agreement. 

Whitmer said in a statement the 

company was putting Michigan 
residents and the Great Lakes at 
risk.

“Here in Michigan, the Great 

Lakes define our borders, but 
they also define who we are as 
people,” Whitmer said. “Enbridge 
has routinely refused to take 
action to protect our Great Lakes 

and the millions of Americans 
who depend on them for clean 
drinking water and good jobs. 
... Most importantly, Enbridge 
has imposed on the people of 
Michigan an unacceptable risk of 
a catastrophic oil spill in the Great 
Lakes that could devastate our 
economy and way of life.” 

Enbridge argues Line 5 is a 

vital piece of infrastructure. In 
a statement Friday, Enbridge 
executive Vern Yu said there was 
no credible basis for terminating 
the easement.

“This notice and the report from 

Michigan Department of Natural 
Resources 
are 
a 
distraction 

from the fundamental facts,” 
Yu said. “Line 5 remains safe, as 
envisioned by the 1953 Easement, 
and as recently validated by our 
federal safety regulator.”

Yu added that the company is 

confident that Line 5 is operating 
safely. 

“We will continue to focus 

on the safe operation of the dual 
Line 5 pipelines at the Straits of 
Mackinac, ensuring the Great 
Lakes are protected while also 
reliably delivering the energy that 
helps to fuel Michigan’s and the 
region’s economy,” Yu said.

Michigan 
Attorney 
General 

Dana Nessel filed a complaint in 
the Ingham County Circuit Court 
to validate the governor’s action. 
Nessel also specified the pipeline 
must be shut down within 180 
days. 

“I commend Gov. Whitmer 

and 
Director 
Eichinger 
for 

their forceful actions today to 
address the grave threat posed 
by Enbridge’s unlawful operation 
of its pipelines in the Straits of 
Mackinac,” Nessel said in a Friday 
statement. “With the steps they 
took today, Gov. Whitmer and 
Director Eichinger are making 
another clear statement that Line 
5 poses a great risk to our state, 
and it must be removed from our 
public waterways.” 

The ongoing pandemic and 

the switch from in-person to 
online events have affected 
religious 
organizations 
on 

campus that previously relied 
on face-to-face interaction to 
build a sense of community. 

Before 
the 
pandemic, 

organizations like the Sikh 
Students Association fostered 
friendship 
through 
social 

events like cider mill trips or 
Kirtan nights, when members 
would play traditional drums 
and sing together, but COVID-
19 put a stop to these activities. 

SSA’s 
leadership 
had 
to 

find ways to work around the 
restrictions 
that 
prevented 

large indoor gatherings. 

LSA 
junior 
Ramneet 

Chauhan, 
co-president 
of 

SSA, said the organization is 

conducting meetings over Zoom 
and had a socially-distanced 
field day at Palmer Field. 

“We’ve seen a lot of first 

years coming to our events, 
even to the Palmer Field event,” 
Chauhan said. “Everyone had a 
lot of fun so I think the sense of 
community is still there.”

Organizations 
have 
also 

adapted 
religious 
holidays 

and 
festivals. 
LSA 
senior 

Deepali Desai, Hindu Students 
Council co-president, said her 
organization had to cancel their 
Holi event because of the initial 
shut down in March.

The first day of Diwali, a 

major Hindu festival, occurred 
this past Saturday. In a COVID-
19-free year, Desai and her 
fellow members would organize 
a large Diwali party, including 
a buffet with food from a local 
Indian restaurant. This year, 
they are focusing on a smaller 
Zoom call for members only to 

celebrate. 

“On the day of Diwali we’re 

just going to dress up and get 
together on Zoom, and we’re 
going to watch a movie or a 
TV show or play some games,” 
Desai said. “We just want to 
celebrate 
with 
each 
other, 

which is something we really 
haven’t been able to do over the 
past few years, because we’d 
usually be so busy with planning 
the banquet and making sure 
everything’s running smoothly 
during that.”

Other holidays, like Rosh 

Hashanah, also had to change. 
But LSA junior Sarah Pomerantz, 
the chair for the undergraduate 
student governing board of 
Hillel, said the organization 
continues to try to create “a 
holistic experience” for Jewish 
students.

Hillel 
organized 
Shofar 

blowing, a Jewish tradition of 
blowing a horn to announce 

the new year, in the Nichols 
Arboretum. Every half hour, 
a group of at most 25 people 
would listen to the service 
while social distancing, leaving 
before the other group came. 

Hillel is also hosting online 

events like trivia nights and 
learning 
programs. 
LSA 

sophomore Nomi Rosen, an 
executive board member of 
I-LEAD, encouraged students 
to take part in the virtual 
events. I-LEAD is a student 
organization 
that 
facilitates 

conversations 
about 
issues 

related to the State of Israel. 

“I think it actually makes 

it a lot easier for students to 
participate because it’s easier 
to do through the platform of 
Zoom and technology,” Rosen 
said. 

Campus religious groups adapt 
activities due to ongoing pandemic

COVID-19 health guidelines limit practices for many faith-based student 
organizations as they seek to build community through virtual interactions

Noor Al-Fikhri was buried 

in a shallow grave under a fig 
tree ten minutes before noon, 
after her left ankle gave out in 
an attempt to hang her blue silk 
dress to dry while climbing the 
rusty, half-removed ladder that 
led to the roof. My 12 year old 
grandmother found her sister 
half-splayed, cats and flies lap-
ping at what little remained of 
the dried blood, her knees dis-
jointed and contorted in the 
special sort of way that could 
only be found on a dead woman. 
The women in their build-
ing wailed and cried for three 
nights and three days, her body 
on their kitchen floor as they 
partook in the Islamic ritual of 
ghusul every Muslim body must 
go through after death. My 
grandmother said their grief 
was so heavy and viscous that 
it crept across every hallway 
and corridor, trapping, toes and 
the balls of feet, so that even 
climbing one flight of stairs 
became the most arduous task. 
Noor was buried in an expert 
fashion, a ritual the three men 
of the graveyard had perfected 
over the years and years they 
had held the job, plowing into 
the thick and hardened dirt, 
angling the shovel up, and down, 
and everywhere in between. 
My grandmother tells me that 
the earth would not accept 
her that day, that the men got 
down on their hands and knees 
and scraped and clawed at the 
ground with their own hands, 
dousing it with water, and forc-
ing the land to open its bowels 
with pieces of rusted metal, in a 
furious and haphazard fashion, 
for there were five more women 

and men and children expected 
to be buried that day and they 
were expected at the mosque 
soon afterwards for late after-
noon prayers. 

Noor’s death became the sort 

of story only told as a caution-

ary tale to misbehaving boys, 
a sad anecdote so frequently 
told over a meal, that the mere 
mention of her name caused 
the tea to sour and the fruit to 
bloat. My grandmother tells me 
the landlord ordered the most 

expensive and sophisticated of 
cleaning supplies from France, 
squatting down on all fours in 
a pressed suit and the finest of 
leather shoes from Istanbul, to 
scrape and scour the splatter of 
blood that remained as the final 

indicator of Noor’s existence. 
The inhabitants of the building 
gathered around him in a big, 
unmoving mass, the men yelling 
that he must scrape the ground 
harder and the women remind-
ing him that he had missed a 

spot. Over the years my grand-
mother among many tried her 
hand at lifting the stain from 
the tile. Scrubbing and scrap-
ing, dabbing and praying and 
smoothing, and yet the stain 
never ceased to exist.

Hamlet

Dil Chahta Hai (“What the 

Heart Wants”) is my favorite 
movie of all time. Ask any of 
my closest family members, 
and they will tell you of my 
persistent (annoying) love for 
this timeless movie. When-
ever there was a movie to 
be watched, everyone knew 
instinctively what my first 
choice would be, even before 
the words left my mouth. For-
tunately for my family, I out-
grew this fervent infatuation 
once I entered college, having 
less time to devote to Bolly-
wood movies.

However, to this day, Dil 

Chahta Hai is a film that stays 
close to my heart. The movie 
has not only stood the test of 
time for many South Asian 
audiences but was a trendset-
ter for the entirety of the Bol-
lywood industry at the time of 
its release in 2001. Back then, 
movies were largely focused on 
a single protagonist and their 
journey towards a cathartic 
resolution, whether it be find-
ing the perfect girl or finally 
robbing the bank. Instead, Dil 
Chahta Hai focused on the 
interconnectedness of three 
friends 
through 
raw 
emo-

tion and layered storytelling. 
With a debut director, Farhan 
Akhtar, and equally young cast 
members, the movie was often 
regarded as “fresh” and “origi-
nal.”

The narrative is told both 

as flashback and in real time 
in Bombay, India, when two of 
the main characters, Sid and 
Sameer, recall their first couple 
years out of college with their 
third friend, Akash. While Bol-
lywood movies often insist on 
portraying cheesy, over-the-
top scenes of friendship and 
romance, Dil Chahta Hai stood 
as a non-conformist, instead 
focusing on internal conflicts 
each character suffered from in 
response to societal standards. 
Every character has their own 
difficulties with what exactly 
their heart wants: love.

While Sameer believes there 

is only true love, Akash doesn’t 
believe in love at all, and Sid is 
convinced no one will under-
stand his definition of love. 
In the arc of the story, each 

character slowly draws away 
from their initial understand-
ings, finding that love is not 
so black-and-white. The char-
acter growth seen in the film 
is gradual and subtle, in stark 
contrast to the many Bolly-
wood movies that leave char-
acter growth solely in the last 
20 minutes. 

Additionally, film shots are 

often much longer than in 
regular Hindi movies, allow-
ing the actors to truly set 
their characters into their 
surrounding 
environments. 

While Sameer sleeps in a small, 
intimate bedroom meant to 
showcase his desires for emo-
tional connection, Sid stays in a 
reserved, upstairs loft with no 
windows, revealing his social 
timidity. Simply put, while 
many Bollywood movies are 
plot-driven, leaving the audi-
ence to guess what will hap-
pen next, Dil Chahta Hai is 
character-driven, inviting the 
audience to live alongside the 
characters themselves without 
the need for extravagant disas-
ters like car crashes or sudden 
deaths.

Equally important is the 

stark diversity in personalities 
that really allows the movie 
to be relatable so many years 
after its initial release. Each 
of the three main characters 
embody different levels of 
human nature. Akash epito-
mizes our desires for pleasure, 
often displayed via conduits of 
impulsivity, humor and action 
while Sid is the complete oppo-
site, someone who is cautious, 
rational 
and 
introspective. 

This leaves Sameer to con-
stantly mediate between his 
two best friends while trying to 
understand his own self in the 
process. Like them, many audi-
ences have been influenced to 
act based on certain emotions, 
making Dil Chahta Hai very 
engaging to various audiences.

Human nature is exempli-

fied by these rather normal 
characters in ways that tran-
scend what South Asian movies 
usually did at the time. While 
I can’t say you will love this 
movie, I think whoever is read-
ing this should take a shot and 
see what the best of Bollywood 
brings to them. Regardless, I 
know that Dil Chahta Hai will 
be one of the best movies I’ll 
ever watch.

My 
friend 
Grace 
and 
I 

arrange ourselves around her 
kitchen table after deciding 
to play a board game to pass 
time during another murky 
day in quarantine. I sit idly 
by as she distributes colorful 
paper money while her broth-
ers argue over who gets to play 
as the top hat. Before I know it, 
the board is set up, cards neatly 
stacked and all. Grace looks 
up and nonverbally ushers me 
to begin when a pretty impor-
tant fact dawns on me: I have 
no idea how to play Monopoly. 
I confess this to Grace, and as I 
anticipate, I am met with com-
plete shock. “How could you 
not know how to play Monopo-
ly? Literally everybody knows, 
it’s like American common 
knowledge.” Despite both of 
us sharing our Middle Eastern 
heritage — and even a name — 
our “common American knowl-
edge” couldn’t have been more 
different for one reason: My 
parents are immigrants, and 
hers aren’t. Her dad taught her 
how to play Monopoly while 
mine was learning English.

Things like this happen quite 

often in my daily life. Whether 
it’s not being able to recognize 
a Beatles song from the first 
few chords, missing a reference 
from a classic movie like “The 
Sound of Music” or showing up 
to a friend’s graduation party 
and not being able to recognize 
a game of cornhole, my experi-
ence as an American is atypical 
from a traditional one. Being 
raised by two immigrants has 
enhanced my life in indescrib-
able ways, and I’ve been lucky 
enough to grow up in an envi-
ronment with a unique cultural 
duality that most of my friends 
didn’t get. However, this has 
caused a disconnect between 
myself and my peers whose 
parents were also raised in the 
United States. Even though, 
in one way or another, many 
immigrants have been “Ameri-
canized” 
throughout 
their 

time in this country, they often 
relay the experiences of their 
upbringings onto their chil-

dren, resulting in an altered 
American experience. Logical-
ly, I know that my friends aren’t 
more American than I am — we 
were all born in the United 
States and have lived here for 
nearly the same amount of 
time; yet, I often find myself 
suffering from imposter syn-
drome, shrouded in feelings of 
shame for not being more con-
nected with American culture. 

The normalization of the sec-

ond-generation and beyond’s 
American experience has made 
it increasingly difficult for 
first-generation Americans to 
feel the same level of comfort in 
the United States. In fact, much 
of the normalized American 
experience belongs to white 
Americans. 
Stereotypical 

American culture encompass-
es baseball games, hot dogs, 
Disney World, denim jackets 
and country music. However, 
much of what we associate 
with being “American” is really 
just being a white American, or 
at least being raised by other 
“Americans.” Since moving to 
Ann Arbor, I’ve found that I’m 
not as independent as my older 
friends’ experiences made me 
think I would be. For them, 
moving out of the house and 
onto campus meant that they 
could let go of past inhibitions 
and fulfill their wildest col-
lege desires. In fact, their par-
ents encouraged this behavior. 
After talking with many of my 
white friends, I’ve found that 
their parents’ expectations of 
college behavior were vastly 
different from those of my 
parents. During their good-
byes before officially moving 
into their dorms, their parents 
sent them off with fake IDs 
and birth control, while mine 
eerily left me with the mantra 
“remember your values” before 
returning home. Even though 
I technically could engage in 
whichever behaviors I want 
behind my parents’ back, I’ll 
never be independent from my 
culture and the expectations 
that come with being part of 
it. Despite the fact that I don’t 
necessarily believe that certain 
actions are morally corrupt, 
I’m constrained by feelings of 
guilt and the fear of deteriorat-

ing my family name. Though I 
am the youngest of my siblings, 
I’m the first to go to a four-year 
university directly after high 
school and live outside of our 
home as a teenager. Part of me 
wants to be the cool, carefree 
and reckless Big Ten college 
student that the movies roman-
ticize. Yet, I face constant 
trepidation and am internally 
bound by the moral and cul-
tural obligations that dictate 
nearly every decision I make. 
Transitioning from high school 
to college life is tumultuous in 
itself, and for second-genera-
tion immigrants, this anxiety 
can be tremendously bolstered.

We need to expand the 

meaning of what it means to 
be American in order to keep 
up with the inclusivity that 
modernity 
requires. 
If 
we 

really want to call ourselves a 
“melting pot,” we need to rec-
ognize the nuanced environ-
ments and circumstances in 
which each of us were raised. 

Nobody should feel less Ameri-
can than someone else because 
their 
background 
doesn’t 

fit 
America’s 
cookie-cutter 

expectations. The notion of 
white picket fences and a cute 
little golden retriever on the 
front lawn doesn’t accurately 
encompass 
Americanness. 

To be American means that 
despite ethnic background, we 
share a national ethos separate 
from politicized ideologies — 
we believe in new beginnings, 
compassion 
and 
dedication. 

Not surprisingly, this is exactly 
what immigration represents 
too. The United States is more 
racially and ethnically diverse 
than it has ever been previ-
ously, and our interpretation 
of what it means to be Ameri-
can must follow suit. My par-
ents may not have ever taught 
me how to play Monopoly, but 
they’ve given me the oppor-
tunity to be their American 
Dream. For that, I will forever 
be grateful.

No, homosexuality 
is not ruining the 
‘Black family unit’

YOUR WEEKLY

ARIES

Slow things down in your love life and 
focus on old fashioned dating, 
sensuality, courtesy and romance, 
Aries. This is a week for exploring 
passion and desire but keep an eye 

out for jealousy and 
obsession too. Check 
your motives in love.

AQUARIUS

GEMINI

Expect to feel slightly lazy and 
physically run down this week, 
Gemini. You’re probably not getting 
enough sleep and you might be 
enjoying a bit too much in the way of 
food or drink. Lethargy can be 

countered with plenty of 
fresh air.

SAGITTARIUS

CAPRICORN

SCORPIO

CANCER

You’ll be feeling fun and flirty this 
week, Cancer, which is good news for 
your love life but not necessarily such 
great news if you have a lot of work 
on. Don’t dodge your career 

responsibilities – delegating to 

someone else is not an 
ideal solution.

TAURUS

Venus sweeps into your romance zone 
this week, Taurus, so whatever else 
happens you’re likely to at least find 
peace and comfort in the arms of your 
lover. Your calm and measured 

approach to life works 
well in all kinds of 
interpersonal communica-
tion.

VIRGO

PISCES

LIBRA
LEO

Hold on to those good vibes for as 
long as you can because your luck 
could turn sour when Venus in Libra 
squares Saturn in Capricorn on 
Thursday. Your sunny streak is 

suddenly covered by dark 
clouds. Expect some 
disappointments or 
losses.

Read your weekly horoscopes from astrology.tv

Your persuasive skills are off the chart 
this week, Virgo, which is excellent 
news if you work in sales, marketing, 
politics or any other field where you 
need to get people on board. In your 

personal life, however, 

sincerity matters more 
than sweet words.

There’s a strong urge to spend this 
week as you’re drawn to luxury and to 
items you can’t really afford, Libra. Try 
to reign in the spending. Venus brings 
you good financial news, but the 

sensible thing to do is to wait 

and see before squander-
ing your cash.

With Venus arriving in your sign, your 
personal magnetism is soaring – if 
you’re looking for love, Scorpio, you 
may have to fend off admirers! 
However, at work, not everyone is 

impressed with your charms. 

It’s important to put in some 

hard work.

Your imagination is one of your 
strong points this week, so this is a 
very good time for writers, artists, 
poets and dreamers of all kinds. Your 
manifestation skills are growing, 

Sagittarius, so look into 

what more you can do to 

create the kind of life 
you want.

Look for new friendships this week, 
Capricorn, as Venus moves into your 
social zone and helps you find your 
tribe. If you’re looking for love, don’t 
be too hasty to dismiss someone as 

being not your ‘type’ – keep 

an open mind!

You’re feeling unusually ambitious but 
ask yourself what your true goals are. 
Much more materialistically motivated 
than normal, Aquarius, you may make 
decisions you normally wouldn’t have, 
based purely on money. Is that where 

you want to head?

Surround yourself with new people or 
visit new places in an effort to curb a 
somewhat restless vibe this week, 
Pisces. If you’re forced to stick with 
the same old, same old, at least try to 
vary your daily routine and enjoy 

some spontaneity.

WHISPER

“Distance makes the heart 
grow fonder? Right??”

“There are too many bagels in 
my kitchen.”

“I am allergic to cats. I want 
one more than anything.”

This Halloween, the rapper 

Lil Nas X paid tribute to his 
idol, Nicki Minaj, by donning 
her iconic look from her 2010 
music video for ‘Super Bass.’

Among the Twitter replies 

and 
Instagram 
comments 

filled with compliments from 
fans and people in the enter-
tainment industry Doja Cat, 
Tierra Whack and Lauren Jau-
regui, Lil Nas X has received a 
lot of homophobic pushback.

While many of the homo-

phobic tweets have now been 
reported and deleted, I noticed 
a specific trend among them. 
Some claimed they weren’t 
being homophobic but were 
worried about how Lil Nas X’s 
actions could affect the young 
Black children who look up to 
him. This is because his song, 
‘Old Town Road’, was very 
popular among kids across the 
country and he even visited 
some elementary schools to 
perform. But why should any 
of this matter?

The fears that queer repre-

sentation in the entertainment 
industry will ‘make kids want 
to be gay’ is unfounded and, 
yes, homophobic because there 
is absolutely nothing wrong or 
abnormal with homosexuality 
or any sexuality. Heterosex-
ism is so ingrained in our cul-
ture that it is not questioned 
or seen as an avenue to sexu-
alize children. Telling a male 
child that he’ll grow up to be a 
‘womanizer’ is seen as a funny 
joke but anything outside of 
the norm, such as wearing 
makeup or dresses, is sudden-
ly sexualized and bad for chil-
dren to experience. Children 
should be allowed to try out 
new things and be themselves 
without 
adults 
connecting 

them to sexuality.

The backlash that Lil Nas 

X and other queer Black folks 
face is hypocritical as well. 
In an entertainment industry 
where many people believe 
that Black men can only gain 
success by wearing a dress, we 
have to think critically about 
why drag or cross-dressing is 
humorous for heterosexual 
Black men but not appropriate 
for queer Black men.

Why are Tyler Perry, Eddie 

Murphy and Martin Lawrence 
able to gain success for their 
cross-dressing performances 
that degrade and make fun of 
fat Black women, but when 
Lil Nas X pays tribute to a 
successful Black woman it’s a 
problem? It further ties into 
deeply rooted sexism towards 
Black women. They can be 
seen as objects to mock by 
straight Black men but not 
icons to praise by gay Black 
men. 

This entire argument is a 

cover to oppress LGBTQ+ peo-
ple and it stems from patriar-
chal and white supremacist 
ideologies. To have a mean-
ingful 
conversation 
about 

why homophobia is present in 

Black communities, we need to 
understand where the domi-
nant idea of masculinity stems 
from. Some people link homo-
sexuality to the emasculation 
of Black men in America as a 
larger goal of white America 
to ruin the Black family and 
therefore the Black race.

There are multiple reasons 

why this argument doesn’t 
hold up. Being gay does not 
mean you cannot be a sup-
portive and loving parent and 
being straight does not mean 
that you will automatically be 
a good parent either. Sexuality 
does not matter, how you treat 
your children matters. On top 
of that, we cannot downplay 
the role of government poli-
cies that have harmed Black 
families such as a criminal 
justice system where Black 
men are disproportionately 
represented and violent eco-
nomic 
disparities. 
I 
don’t 

believe any amount of individ-
ual or behavioral change can 
dismantle 
these 
oppressive 

policies that break up Black 
families.

While I can’t pretend to 

know what it is like to be a 
Black man in America, I do 
know that the social norms 
we’ve been taught throughout 
our lives are not inherent, yet 
social constructions of race 
and gender result in very real-
life experiences. The oppres-
sion of Black queer folks from 
Black heterosexual men on the 
basis of ‘morals’ only furthers 
white supremacy.

Patricia Hill Collins’ “Black 

Feminist Thought” urges us to 
reexamine how we think about 
masculinity and femininity in 
a white supremacist society 
that has done everything it 
can to create a false dichot-
omy between Blackness and 
whiteness. If white heterosex-
ual men have made themselves 
the standard to uphold, then 
anyone outside of those iden-
tities must be ‘othered.’ Under 
this way of thinking, white is 
good, Black is bad. Men are 
strong, women are weak. Het-
erosexuality is natural, homo-
sexuality is deviant. The push 
from some Black people in the 
community to emulate what 
is seen as the ‘standard’ in 
the United States ultimately 
upholds 
patriarchal, 
white 

supremacist and homophobic 
ideologies that just aren’t true.

Lil Nas X should not be 

responsible 
for 
teaching 

children 
‘morals,’ 
and 
his 

queerness and their possible 
queerness should not be seen 
as negative or harmful. We 
cannot blame Black queer 
people for the disrespect that 
white people have always 
directed towards Black folks. 
We cannot blame them for the 
lack of accurate Black media 
representation or compare the 
stability of Black families to 
the existence of queer Black 
men. Homophobia is distract-
ing us from the real reason 
why Black men aren’t treated 
the same as white men: sys-
temic racism.

Opinion

It’s no secret that both the 

administration and the students 
made mistakes this semester. 
We’ve recorded thousands of 
cases of COVID-19, which resulted 
in a countywide shutdown of 
undergraduate activity. Now is 
the time to prove we can do better. 
The University needs to expand 
housing to accommodate students 
with special cases and make their 
criteria to stay on campus more 
widely known and accessible for 
those not able to move home. The 
University also needs to release 
a clear and comprehensive plan 
to actually implement effective 
COVID-19 testing, which did 
not happen this fall. Students 
need to take this opportunity to 
make responsible decisions going 
forward.

The looming uncertainty of 

housing security haunts freshmen, 
causing them to seek off-campus 
alternatives instead of re-applying 
for residence halls where they 
will also avoid mandatory testing 
by the University. While the new 
plan was implemented in hopes 
of reducing off-campus social 
gatherings — citing that there is 
“little evidence” that on-campus 
activities largely contribute to 
the spread of the virus — it seems 
that the new plan is doing just the 
opposite. 

Furthermore, the University’s 

plan could encourage those who 
have neglected social distancing 
guidelines to push parties further 
underground, while those who 
have honored the University’s 
policies are left in the dust. 
And while the University is 
allowing 
select 
students 
to 

return to campus housing if their 
circumstances qualify them for 
need-based on-campus housing 
and they applied by Nov. 11, the 
requirements appear muddy. The 
qualifications 
for 
need-based 

housing include students who are 
taking a necessary in-person class, 
who have financial needs, who 
have wellness or safety concerns, 
international 
students 
and 

ResStaff. However, the University 
neglects 
to 
precisely 
define 

“wellness or safety concerns,” 
which could potentially exclude 
students 
with 
mental 
health 

concerns if they aren’t prioritized. 
In 
addition, 
the 
closing 
of 

residence halls disproportionately 
affects marginalized students who 
don’t have the privilege of signing 
a lease with five days of notice, 
as well as students who cannot 
afford to take a gap year or gap 
semester due to financial aid that 
requires them to enroll as a full-
time student.

The University is scapegoating 

freshmen 
as 
the 
culprits 
of 

the 
“unacceptable” 
levels 
of 

COVID-19 cases this fall rather 
than admitting to their own 
wrongdoings. As predicted by the 
graduate student employees in the 
beginning of this semester, the 
University’s plan for the fall was 
insufficient to prevent the spread 
of COVID-19 and strict changes 

are necessary. While students 
do have agency of their own, by 
relying on students to socially 
distance on a campus designed 
to 
promote 
socialization, 
the 

University is at fault for the rise 
in cases we have experienced this 
semester. Earlier, the Graduate 
Employees’ Organization strike 
campaigned for the Division of 
Public Safety and Security funds to 
be relocated to the implementation 
of COVID-19 protections and for 
mandatory testing. Instead of 
blaming freshmen, the University 
should have listened more to the 
demands of the GEO strike, or at 
least have credited them in the 
plan for the winter semester.

The University’s announcement 

for 
the 
upcoming 
semester 

contains plans for more robust 
testing, 
including 
testing 
all 

on-campus 
residents 
and 

attendees of in-person classes or 
research. However, the breakage 
of all residence hall leases that 
has pushed on-campus students 
to scramble for sublets and winter 
leases decreases the number of 
students the University would 
be 
responsible 
for 
testing. 

While the increased availability 
of 
asymptomatic 
testing 
will 

increase overall testing, students 
off-campus are unlikely to make 
the effort to get tested often 
without enforcement, especially as 
the weather becomes colder. Many 
other universities across the nation 
have managed to increase testing 
numbers 
through 
penalizing 

students for not getting tested or 
even offering prizes and rewards 
for getting tested. The University 
should 
consider 
implementing 

similar systems to encourage more 
widespread testing.

The 
University 
witnessed 

a spike in third-party testing 
this semester. Many students 
have voiced concerns over being 
forced into the infamous isolation 
housing and difficulties in getting 
tested through the University 
Health Service. The winter 2021 
testing 
plan 
does 
guarantee 

“weekly 
asymptomatic 
testing 

available for all students … who 
are not otherwise covered by a 
mandatory program.” For this 
policy to be effective, however, 
the University must make it easy 
for students to sign up for testing, 
offer different testing locations 
for accessibility to off-campus 
students 
and 
encourage 
all 

students to get tested routinely. 

The success of the University’s 

plan 
to 
control 
COVID-19 

during the winter 2021 semester 
cannot rely upon administrative 
efforts alone. We, as students, 
must be willing to follow public 
health 
guidelines, 
including 

the 
sacrifices 
that 
entails. 

While many students have been 
staying 
socially 
distanced, 
a 

large portion of undergraduates 
have continued to engage in 
unsafe activities. Fraternity & 
Sorority Life members continue 
to host and attend large indoor 
gatherings and hold in-person 

recruitment events. As a result, 
FSL has experienced COVID-19 
outbreaks. Students also continue 
to gather in large numbers in and 
around bars and restaurants near 
campus, including the Brown 
Jug, which became a COVID-19 
hotspot earlier this semester. And 
as Michigan football began its 
delayed season, the “Overheard 
at umich” Facebook page featured 
several images documenting large 
and unmasked tailgate events. 
While the University has failed us 
with an insufficient plan for fall 
semester, we have also failed each 
other.

Many students have expressed 

frustration that administration 
is 
shifting 
blame 
onto 

uncooperative 
undergraduates, 

but we need to stop giving them 
this option in the first place. 
Though 
administration 
bears 

the ultimate responsibility, we 
should engage on an individual 
level — the same way many 
environmental 
activists 
view 

individual climate action. Just as 
no one person can stop climate 
change, no one student can 
control the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But the combination of individual 
efforts sends a collective message 
to the University that we are 
willing to make sacrifices and 
concessions for our community, 
and we expect nothing less from 
them. Finally, we need to hold 
one another accountable with 
student-led initiatives, similar 
to the “F*ck It Won’t Cut It” 
campaign spearheaded by Boston 
University 
undergraduates. 

Wolverines should collectively 
encourage one another to stay 
COVID-conscious this winter — 
and should productively call one 
another out when we don’t.

The winter 2021 plan presents 

significant changes to life at the 
University next semester. In 
many ways, this plan has been the 
one the community demanded 
for fall — limited on-campus 
housing, widespread testing and 
courses held remotely whenever 
possible. But transitioning to this 
plan in the middle of the school 
year will cause disruption for 
many students. Moreover, the 
fumbling of the fall semester 
by administration has created 
skepticism toward the University’s 
ability to pull off the revamped 
winter plan. Ultimately, next 
semester will be an exercise in 
trust-building for students, both 
with administration and with 
each other. Will the University 
prioritize students over profits to 
keep us safe? Will they take full 
responsibility for their missteps 
rather than shifting blame onto 
students? 
And 
will 
students 

be willing to make personal 
sacrifices to demonstrate that 
they take this crisis seriously? 
The failures of this fall have sown 
animosity and distrust within 
our community. The winter plan 
may be the first step toward 
improvement — but it could also 
make things even worse.

I 

imagine that for the political 
aspirant, there’s a great deal 
to learn from this election 

regarding 
campaign 
strategy, 

polling accuracy, voting patterns 
and a myriad of other facets of 
electoral politics. As ever with 
an eye for history, I ignored 
this and went back to watch 
Sen. John McCain’s, R-Ariz., 
concession speech from 2008. 
It demonstrated with startling 
clarity and eloquence the aspect 
of today’s politics I find most 
despairing: The bygone virtues 
of mutual respect and agreement. 
While a concession speech may 
seem entirely antithetical to 
compromise, insofar as only 
one candidate wins the race, 
McCain’s 
speech 
conveys 

the 
fundamental 
essence 
of 

compromise. 

The very notion of compromise 

necessitates 
concession, 
as 

coincidental as that wording may 
be. But to reach an agreement 
in which both parties believe 
they’ve gained or lost does not 
demand a weak will or loosely 
held convictions. In fact, it’s 
the opposite. Compromise is 
never easy, and surely not for 
those so stubborn to the point 
of absolute immobility. Change 
is incremental and cooperative; 
such is the nature of our county, 
of our government and of people. 

Thankfully, we live in a system 

that doesn’t enforce a universal 
belief set. We are free to pursue, 
maintain and change our own 
convictions however we see fit. 
This invites discord and the idea 
of opposition, but disagreement 
should not premise a refusal to 
compromise. In his concession, 
Sen. McCain said just that: 
“Sen. Obama and I have had and 
argued our differences, and he 
has prevailed.” 

He also said, “I urge all 

Americans 
who 
supported 

me to join me in not just 
congratulating him, but offering 
our next president our goodwill 
and earnest effort to find ways 
to come together, to find the 
necessary 
compromises, 
to 

bridge 
our 
differences 
and 

help restore our prosperity.” 
As foreign as his words may 
sound today, they serve only as 
conclusions, not solutions, to the 
question of compromise. So, what 
then is this fundamental essence 
of compromise? 

It’s mutual respect for the 

person on the other end of the 
table, and it’s an appreciation 
for 
a 
collective 
association 

greater than any political party. 
Critically, such respect does 
not exist without integrity and 
decency. 

Reading and listening to Sen. 

McCain’s speech, it is remarkable 
the degree to which his character 
shines. In commenting on his life 
as a public servant, McCain said, 
“I would not be an American 
worthy of the name, should I 
regret a fate that has allowed 
me the extraordinary privilege 
of serving this country for a half 
a century.” Suchis reverence for 
his work makes clear that his 
words on compromise were said 
wholeheartedly.

In 
congratulating 
his 

opponent, he said, “A little while 
ago, I had the honor of calling Sen. 
Barack Obama — to congratulate 
him on being elected the next 
president of the country that 
we both love.” When the crowd 
in Arizona began to boo after 
hearing Obama’s name, McCain 
held out his hands, imploring his 
supporters to refrain. Later, he 
said, “I hold in my heart nothing 
but love for this country and for 
all its citizens, whether they 
supported me or Sen. Obama, I 
wish Godspeed to the man who 
was my former opponent and will 
be my president.” 

All of this brings me to 

where we stand today. In the 12 
years since McCain’s speech, 
we seem to have forgotten 
how to compromise. Divided 
government 
has 
become 
a 

byword for stagnation when, 
instead, 
it 
should 
foster 

compromise. 
Speaker 
of 
the 

House Nancy Pelosi refused to 
move on stimulus negotiations 
this 
past 
October, 
leaving 

talks at a complete impasse. 

In 
2016, 
regarding 
Judge 

Merrick 
Garland’s 
Supreme 

Court nomination, Sen. Mitch 
McConnell, R-Ky., said, “One 
of my proudest moments was 
when I looked Barack Obama in 
the eye and said, ‘Mr. President, 
you will not fill the Supreme 
Court vacancy.’” McConnell’s 
statement 
is 
far 
beyond 
a 

refusal 
to 
compromise, 
and 

calling it indecent is a dramatic 
understatement. 

President Trump has yet to 

formally concede and give a 
concession speech. He instead 
took to Twitter, commenting, 
“this election is far from over.” 
When — or if — he gives a 
concession speech, I can only 
imagine how it might differ from 
any such congratulatory speech 
we’ve seen before. Joe Biden 
has run a campaign centered 
on unity and spoke further 
about those ideals in his victory 
speech 
this 
past 
Saturday 

evening. I hope his drive to unify 
and heal American divisiveness 
is genuine, such that we may 
rekindle the respect, integrity 
and decency for one another I 
fear we’ve lost. 

Compromise, as it exists in 

the legislative process and in the 
structure of our government, 
serves as a check on the 
majority and ensures the beliefs 
of the minority are heard. At the 
Constitutional Convention in 
1787, Benjamin Franklin spoke 
truths equally of woodworking 
as of compromise: “When a 
broad table is to be made, and 
the edges of planks do not fit, 
the artist takes a little from 
both, and makes a good joint.” 

As 
a 
nation 
and 
as 

individuals, we are the sum 
of innumerable influences. In 
the same way, two halves of an 
arch cannot stand without its 
keystone. A citizenry of split 
ideas cannot stand without 
embracing compromise and the 
respect, civility and decency it so 
commands.

Joe Biden won, but America lost

David Lisbonne can be reached at 

lisbonne@umich.edu.

T

he 
last 
American 

president 
to 
lose 
a 

reelection 
campaign 

was President George H.W. 
Bush in 1992. On election 
night, Bush conceded to then-
Governor Bill Clinton and 
gave a speech thanking his 
supporters and wishing the 
future president well in the 
White House. Bush spoke of 
ensuring a smooth transition 
of power and asked Americans 
to “stand behind our new 
president regardless of our 
differences.” 

The American people have 

not yet heard such a speech 
from President Donald Trump, 
and it is unlikely that we ever 
will. Instead, the president of 
the United States has recklessly 
tweeted, 
retweeted 
and 

spoken of baseless accusations 
of voter fraud and claims to 
have won the election. While 
many individuals may likely 
understand that there is no 
evidence to back up these 
false accusations, it remains 
true that a large portion of 
the country believes Trump 
when he says that he won the 
election. 

Though Joe Biden has won 

the requisite 270 electoral 

votes to declare victory and 

will become the president 
on Jan. 20, 2021, it is unclear 
how many Trump supporters 
will view Biden as a legitimate 
president. 
Some 
of 
these 

supporters 
are 
high-profile 

elected officials, who have not 
only refused to congratulate 
President-elect 
Biden, 
but 

also repeat Trump’s rhetoric 
about the illegitimacy of this 
election. Sen. Lindsey Graham, 
R-S.C., and Sen. Ted Cruz, 
R-Texas, have both appeared 
on Fox News since Biden was 
announced the winner to call 
into question the legitimacy 
of the election and to argue 
that Trump still has a path to 
reelection. 

It is bad enough that so 

many 
people 
believe 
that 

Biden stole this election from 
Trump, but even worse is 
that people such as Graham 
and Cruz, two well-known 

senators, are allowing people 
to continue believing it. Belief 
in the electoral system is key 
to American democracy, and 
two senators are participating 
in accusations that reject that 
belief with no evidence. 

Regardless 
of 
what 
you 

might think of Biden or Trump 
and who you think should be 
the president, it has become 
clear that America lost this 
election. 
Regardless 
of 

partisanship and who would 
perform better as president, 
when a candidate announces 
he won when he didn’t and 
accuses states of voter fraud 
with no evidence, and people 
believe him, that country’s 
democracy 
is 
in 
trouble. 

American democracy is in 
trouble. 

We 
shouldn’t 
really 
be 

surprised 
that 
Trump 
has 

refused to concede. He’s said 
repeatedly that he wouldn’t 
necessarily accept the results 
of the election if he lost, and 
he’s said in the past that he 
might try to run for a third 
term in 2024. On the other 
hand, it’s almost surprising 
that prominent Republicans, 
including 
former 
president 

George W. Bush and Sen. 
Mitt 
Romney, 
R-Utah, 

have come out against this 
rhetoric 
and 
congratulated 

Biden, considering that many 
Republicans have spent much 
of the last four years only 
condemning 
the 
president 

when absolutely necessary. 

But elections only work if 

everyone involved respects the 
outcome. If everyone who lost 

an election claimed they won, 
people would have no faith 
in the electoral system and 
would not trust any election. 
As Americans, we should be 
appalled and concerned that 
our 
president, 
along 
with 

the many who support him, 
refuse to participate in a 
peaceful transition of power 
and instead deny this pillar of 
American democracy. 

I am worried about the 

future of America. As the 
country 
becomes 
more 

entrenched in our political 
dichotomy and aggressively 
stereotypes 
people 
on 

either side of the political 
spectrum, it becomes more 
likely that our democracy 
will be in trouble. As long as 
there continue to be political 
figures who encourage this 
type of thinking and cast 
doubt about the integrity of 
our elections, we will remain 
on a dangerous path both in 
terms of our democracy and 
in terms of what it means to 
be an American.

A 
Biden 
presidency 

could help to heal some of 
the damage that has been 
done to the U.S. due to rifts 
between identities like race, 
gender, 
geography 
and 

political affiliation. But if the 
Republicans who refuse to 
condemn Trump’s efforts to 
remain in power continue to 
do so, the healing of our nation 
will be an extremely difficult 
job, if not an impossible one. 
If 
the 
Democratic 
Party 

continues 
to 
ignore 
the 

thoughts of the white working 
class, especially those in rural 
America, people will continue 
to want what Trump brought 
to the White House in our 
government. 

You can either celebrate 

or mourn the end of the 
Trump presidency. But you 
must accept the results of 
this election and all other 
elections if you want the U.S. 
to continue to be a functioning 
democracy.

FROM THE DAILY

Skepticism for winter 2021

O

n Nov. 6, the University of Michigan announced a plan for the winter 
semester that included major changes to on-campus housing, class 
formats and testing protocols and accessibility. Most notably, the 

University will be converting on-campus housing into single-occupancy 
units, with undergraduates required to provide a reason to stay in one. 
Additionally, COVID-19 testing will be made mandatory for all students 
living in on-campus housing or participating in on-campus activities, and 
an even larger proportion of classes will be moved online than were during 
the fall semester. Upon releasing the plan, University President Mark 
Schlissel stated, “The changes we’ve made for winter semester reflect 
what we’ve learned and what we must do to keep our community safe.”

Elections only 

work if everyone 

involved 

respects the 

outcome.


T

he 
Equal 
Rights 

Amendment was first 
introduced to Congress 

in 1923 by suffragists Alice 
Paul and Crystal Eastman. In 
1972, it passed in Congress, 
but the necessary number of 
states failed to ratify it by 
the 1982 deadline. Since then, 
it has incited a great deal of 
debate on both sides of the 
aisle. In the revolutionary and 
arguably electric atmosphere 
we’re living in, the Equal 
Rights 
Amendment 
should 

finally be ratified and added to 
the Constitution. 

The 
Equal 
Rights 

Amendment is a proposed 
amendment broken down into 
three sections. The sections 
read 
as 
follows: 
“Section 

1: Equality of rights under 
the law shall not be denied 
or abridged by the United 
States or by any State on 
account of sex. Section 2: The 
Congress shall have the power 
to enforce, by appropriate 
legislation, 
the 
provisions 

of this article. Section 3: 
This amendment shall take 
effect 2 years after the date 
of ratification.” Supporters of 
the ERA argue its necessity 
is borne out of a lack of 
Constitutional interpretation 
of the rights of women as 
an 
identity 
deserving 
of 

equality even within the 14th 
Amendment. 

Further, the ERA is meant 

to 
clearly 
codify 
women 

and men as of equal class — 
guaranteeing “equal justice 
under law” on the basis of sex. 
Section 1 of the ERA would be 
the first explicit mention of 
“women” in the Constitution. 
Many who disagree with the 
ERA use the 14th Amendment 
and the Equal Pay Act to argue 
that it would be a superfluous, 
even redundant, amendment. 

This is not the case. The 

14th Amendment was ratified 
after the Civil War and was 
meant to specifically address 
the immense racial injustice 
in 1868. If it had effectively 
acknowledged women as an 
equal sex, women (at least 
white women, considering that 
most women of color were not 
granted suffrage until decades 
later) would have been granted 
suffrage then as opposed to 
52 years later with the 19th 
Amendment in 1920. Without 
the Equal Rights Amendment, 
current legal protections, like 
that of the Equal Pay Act, can 
theoretically be removed by a 
single vote. Delving even deeper, 
ratification of the ERA would 
emphasize the consideration and 
protection 
against 
sex-based 

discrimination legally. We must 
secure a better foundation of 
constitutional equality through 
explicitly stating the necessity 
of legal equity; without the ERA, 
this cannot happen.

Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s 

confirmation 
as 
a 
Supreme 

Court Justice was met with 
unease and apprehension from 
many pro-choice women (and 
men). In the already turbulent, 
near-apocalyptic 
atmosphere, 

the possibility that the progress 
made by determined feminists — 
such as the late Associate Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg — could 
potentially be undone is enough 
to pass an amendment that will 
protect the major advances in 
women’s rights. 

Despite 
having 
received 

ratification by the required 38 
states, the ERA has been met 
with many legal challenges that 
have prevented its certification 
as an official part of the United 
States Constitution. While it 
gets a bit complicated the more 
that you attempt to untangle this 
political and legal conundrum, 

it gets boiled down to this: 
there are two strategies for the 
ratification of the ERA. The first 
is through the Constitutional 
Ratification Process in Article V 
of the Constitution; a two-thirds 
majority vote in the Senate and 
the House of Representatives 
is required before it is sent 
for 
three-fourths 
of 
state 

legislatures 
to 
ratify. 
The 

second mode is known as the 
“Three-State Strategy” which 
emphasizes that only three more 
states were needed in addition 
to the 35 existing ratifications 
that supporters argue should be 
deemed legally viable. 

It is imperative that we ratify 

this amendment. By declaring 
a “zero tolerance” message, the 
Equal Rights Amendment gives 
a megaphone to the millions of 
activists who have fought for 
and passed the legislation that 
has continued to work toward 
equality for all people. 

Since its inception in 1923, 

the ERA has remained an active 
component 
in 
the 
political 

conversations 
of 
equality 

and 
feminism. 
President-

elect Joe Biden — an avid 
supporter of the ERA — has 
personally 
co-sponsored 
the 

ERA ratification nine times. 
Directly 
on 
his 
campaign’s 

website, 
Biden 
includes 

extensive 
information 
about 

his agenda for women; within 
this agenda, it explicitly states: 
“as President he will work with 
advocates across the country to 
enshrine gender equality in our 
Constitution” in reference to 
passage of the ERA. With our 
first female Vice President-elect 
Kamala Harris alongside Biden, 
it is time to learn more about 
the ERA and finally see it in our 
Constitution.

The terrifying world of ants puts 

humans in perspective

MARGARET RUDNICK | COLUMN

Affirmative action is here to stay

JESSIE MITCHELL | COLUMN

It’s time to pass the ERA

D

onald Trump may be 
on his way out, but 
the war on affirmative 

action 
remains 
ongoing. 

Despite the fact that lawsuits 
against universities for their 
admissions policies have been 
largely unsuccessful, both the 
Department of Justice and 
private conservative activist 
groups continue to file them. In 
early October, the Department 
of 
Justice 
filed 
a 
lawsuit 

against Yale for race-based 
discrimination, adding another 
high profile affirmative action 
case to the mix. Though the 
Supreme Court has ruled four 
times in the last forty years 
that 
affirmative 
action 
is 

constitutional, Harvard, the 
University of Texas at Austin 
and the University of North 
Carolina at Chapel Hill are all 
fighting similar suits. 

The fight for schools to 

remain race-conscious in an 
effort to maintain diversity 
and reach their educational 
goals has been fought and won 
many times in the nation’s 
highest courts. While every 
new 
lawsuit 
alleges 
that 

taking race into account is 
discriminatory and ruinous 
to the meritocratic principles 
of this nation, time and time 
again, the data does not bear 
this out. It makes me wonder if 
Students for Fair Admissions, 
one of the primary groups 
bringing these lawsuits, has 
heard of legacy preference.

A 
lawsuit, 
brought 
by 

Students for Fair Admissions 
against 
UNC’s 
admission 

criteria, is continuing to a 
federal trial this week. The 
suit alleges that race is used 
“at every stage” of determining 
the admission decisions of 
Black and Hispanic students. 
However, statistical analyses 
of the admissions decisions 
differ substantially, showing 
that race accounts for under 
1% of decisions to up to 42% of 
in-state Black applicants. UNC 
denies that race is more than 
one of a multitude of factors 
used in admissions. 

Though the Supreme Court 

has held that racial quotas are 
unconstitutional, affirmative 
action 
and 
admissions 
or 

hiring practices that consider 
race as one of many factors 
were deemed permissible. 

Students
for
Fair 

Admissions 
argue 
that 

diversity could be achieved 
by concentrating admissions 
decisions around geography 
or 
socioeconomics 
instead 

of race — a “race-neutral” 
approach. UNC and Harvard, 
who has also dealt with 
recent 
challenges 
to 
its 

consideration 
of 
race 
in 

admissions, both claim this 
proposed change would only 
serve to reduce diversity. 

There is plenty of evidence 

to suggest that UNC and 
Harvard are correct. Chicago 
Public Schools used race-
based admissions as a way 
to diversify its test-in high 
schools until 2009, when it 
turned 
to 
socioeconomic-

based 
admissions 
after 
a 

court mandate to integrate 
students 
based 
on 
race, 

defining 
them 
as 
either 

“‘white’ or ‘minority,’” was 
lifted. Socioeconomic status 
as a factor for admissions 
to 
these 
selective 
high 

schools was intended to help 
maintain the racial diversity 
of the schools. 

Socioeconomic factors are 

applied to census tracts in the 
city, designating each census 
tract tier 1-4. Schools then 
take a certain percentage of 
their 
student 
populations 

from each tier, with 30% of the 
seats going to the top scorers, 
regardless of their tier. From 
2009 to 2019, the percentage 
of white students at Walter 
Payton College Preparatory 
High School, one of the city’s 
top public high schools, has 
increased from 36% to 44%, 
while the percentage of Black 
students has decreased from 
26% to 11%. For context, the 
district was about 11% white 
in 2019, compared to almost 
36% Black. 

Not only are “race-neutral” 

approaches 
to 
achieving 

racial 
diversity 
in 
schools 

ineffective, 
they 
are 
also 

nonsensical. As argued in the 
“Journal of Law Reform” at 
the University of Michigan, 
“a ‘race neutral alternative’ 
only makes sense when the 
goal itself is race neutral.” For 
as long as schools hold racial 
diversity as important to their 
educational mission, it makes 
sense to be race conscious 
during the admissions process. 

But what about the poor 

victims of affirmative action? 
Depending 
on 
where 
you 

are and who you ask, these 
are usually either white or 
Asian 
American 
students. 

At 
Harvard, 
where 
the 

affirmative action suit hinges 
around 
admissions 
policies 

that are allegedly unfair to 
Asian 
American 
students, 

even if all Black and Latinx 
applicants were eliminated, 
the 
percentage 
of 
Asian 

American students admitted 
would rise by only about 1%. In 
California — where affirmative 
action has been banned in 
the University of California 
university system since 1998 
— the share of Asian students 
has declined, suggesting that 
they were beneficiaries of 
affirmative action. 

In the case of UT-Austin, 

the white plaintiff in Fisher v. 
The University of Texas was 
denied admission, but so were 
168 Black or Latinx students 
with grades as good or better 
than hers. Affirmative action 
has been a huge boost to 
white women specifically, and 
it is also worth noting that 
at elite colleges, preference 
for legacy admits plays a far 
larger role than race and 
disproportionately 
favors

white 
students. 
In 
other 

words, if you didn’t get into 
your dream school, it’s far 
more likely that a white kid 
took “your” spot.

A

nts are small, numerous 
and have taken over the 
surface of the world. 

These seemingly innocuous, tiny 
creatures are deadly in their 
world of thievery, conquest 
and warfare. In a way that 
corresponds to human nature, 
some species of ants beg, borrow 
and steal from neighboring 
colonies to survive. Argentine 
ants, in particular, have spread 
throughout the world to every 
continent except Antarctica in 
a global imperialistic invasion. 
Many parallels can be drawn 
between the behaviors of ants 
and humans that can allow us 
to examine our own behavior in 
a new light. We can and should 
learn from the inner workings 
of ant society.

Animals 
in 
nature 
often 

commit what we today would 
view as war acts without 
remorse, tearing other animals 
limb from limb and eradicating 
neighboring tribes or nations; 
ants are no exception. They 
pillage rival anthills, killing 
millions of their kind almost 
every day. Some ant species 
resort to downright exploding 
themselves to take down foes. 
This kills not only the larger 
attacking ant but the attacker 
themselves. This ant’s only 
purpose at this moment is to 
die for its tribe, despite its 
lifelong work of collecting food, 
sustaining itself and being 
useful to its colony. The ant’s 
sacrifice will benefit the colony 
but at the extreme expense of 

taking its own life. 
Ants commit the ultimate 

individual sacrifice for the 
sake of the colony without 
hesitating 
or 
knowing 
the 

enormity of their actions to 
their community. We like to 
think that humans are strong 
and brave for rising above 
our built-in selfish natures 
by committing small acts of 
altruism, but this perception 
needs 
reconsideration. 
The 

average human isn’t selfless 
when compared to almost any 
ant in existence. 

Another 
perception 
that 

needs changing: Humans are 
the ultimate social creature on 
Earth, collaborating to erect 
massive works of architecture 
and 
complex 
intellectual 

theories. You guessed it. Ants 
are one of the most social 
creatures on Earth — more so 
than humans. In fact, they’re 
hive creatures (the scientific 
term for this is eusociality). They 
do things for their colonies that 
most humans wouldn’t dream 
of doing for their own countries 
without major consideration.

There are more than 16,000 

different ant species on the 
planet today. In fact, scientists 
estimate 
a 
total 
of 
20,000 

species of ants in existence 
on Earth, which means about 
4,000 species have yet to be 
discovered. 
Behavior 
varies 

between the different species 
(e.g. some ant species focus on 
foraging for plants while others 
almost exclusively raid other 
nests and insects). Despite great 
physiological diversity among 
species, almost all individual 
ants exhibit a willingness to 
sacrifice for the entire nest more 
than an individual human would 
for a town or country, bringing 
us back to the point that human 
selflessness as a construct lags 
behind that of ants.

As well as being more selfless 

and more social than humans, 
ants do war better than we do. 
Among the 16,000 total ant 
species discovered, there is an 
“army ant” sect that consists of 
200 ant species. These aggressive 
species raid other animals to 
obtain food, attacking prey with 
enormous 
numbers. 
Warrior 

ants such as the Argentine ant 
and the red imported fire ant 
are waging wars daily, killing 
and consuming hundreds of 
thousands of prey animals per 
day. Humans have taken over the 
world in the sense that we have 
conquered most of the available 
land on Earth, and it’s interesting 
to think that ants have already 
done this; after all, they’ve had 
160 million years of existence to 

spread themselves around the 
world. This is the consequence of 
perfectly synchronized sociality 
and sacrifice.

We praise the qualities of 

social achievement and altruistic 
behavior, but from ants we have 
learned that these qualities are 
not good for an animal in the 
extreme. If groups of humans 
were fully social or completely 
altruistic, we could have mass 
war on our hands — and everyone 
can agree that that is not a good 
thing.

Army ants have very few 

means of communication relative 
to humans. Visually, they can tell 
night from day and distinguish 
almost nothing more than that. 
They can’t even form an image of 
the world around them, relying 
on their senses of smell and touch 
for detecting vibrations. Their 
only tool for communication is 
the use of pheromones. However, 
warrior ants are still capable of 
amassing huge groups for raids, 
sometimes 
even 
more 
than 

100,000 individuals — amazing 
given how difficult it is for 
humans to organize ourselves 
with all five of our senses. Their 
behavior can even inform how 
computers should be organized, 
because it’s miraculous that they 
can successfully function socially 
given their limited forms of 
communication. 

The world of army ants and 

their ant neighbors is vicious. We 
should care about ants because 
their behavior so closely mirrors 
our 
own. 
War, 
cooperation, 

sacrifice: Ants do each of these 
things better than humans ever 
have. Ants are the meta-social 
epitome of what we don’t want 
human society to become. Every 
day, thousands of ants die as 
their colonies bring chaos and 
violence upon other unassuming 
prey. Their environmental niche 
drives them to kill millions of 
other animals weekly. This is the 
terrifying world that exists under 
the feet of our civilization.

A

fter the tide turned against 
his conquest of continental 
Europe, 
Napoleon 
was 

decisively defeated by a coalition of 
European powers in the spring of 
1814. The French emperor was then 
exiled by the victors to the small 
island of Elba, off the western coast 
of Italy. As the coalition powers met 
to determine the postwar balance 
of power in Europe, Napoleon, 
conscious of his popularity in 
France, 
slipped 
out 
of 
exile, 

returned to Paris and, until his final 
defeat at Waterloo, resumed the 
imperial throne.

When the royalist government 

that replaced Napoleon caught 
wind of the former emperor’s 
landing in southern France, it 
deployed the military to stop his 
march towards Paris. Near the city 
of Grenoble, some of the royalist 
soldiers encountered Napoleon’s 
forces. Napoleon walked up to 
them and ripped open his coat. “If 
there is one among you who wishes 
to kill his emperor,” Napoleon 
supposedly said, “here I am.” None 
of the soldiers fired upon him. In 
fact, they defected, and joined with 
their emperor’s forces on his march 
towards Paris.

206 years later and one Atlantic 

Ocean away, Americans contended 
with their own emperor. The people 

have spoken, and King Donald I has 
been dethroned. Now that President 
Donald Trump will not occupy the 
Oval Office come Jan. 20, 2021, a 
civil war is coming. Not that kind 
of civil war, thank God — a civil war 
within the Republican Party.

Where does the GOP leadership 

go from here? Do they try to smother 
the Trumpian populist movement, 
drop the lame duck president like a 
hot orange potato, slowly distancing 
themselves 
from 
a 
disgraced 

Trump, in favor of a return to 
establishment normalcy? Or do they 
still champion Trumpism, allowing 
the outgoing president’s movement 
to continue to define the party?

“You 
know 
how 
to 
make 

America great again?” asked Sen. 
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., in 2015. 
“Tell Donald Trump to go to hell.” 
Sounding like a Democrat, Graham 
continued by calling then-candidate 
Trump “a race-baiting, xenophobic, 
religious 
bigot,” 
and 
defiantly 

pronounced that Trump “doesn’t 
represent my party.”

Graham, being the spineless 

shill that he is, later became one of 
Trump’s most vocal supporters in 
the Senate. But will he, and others in 
his position, now turn their backs on 
the president again? With Trump 
now trumped, what’s the expedient 
move?

It’s hard to predict the behavior 

of hypocrites like Graham, because 
hypocrites, 
being 
hypocrites, 

are unpredictable by nature. In 
the coming weeks, however, the 
rhetoric of these folks will be telling 
as to the direction of the Republican 
Party. But what will the two sides 
of the Republicans’ civil war be? 
And more importantly, who will 
ultimately win the soul of the GOP?

My best guess is the Old Guard 

— the Mitch McConnell, Lindsey 
Graham and Kevin McCarthy types 
— will slowly and surely distance 
themselves from Trump. Not an 
outright rejection, but a cautious, 
wakeless troll in the direction 
of normalcy. The problem — the 
futility, really — with this approach 
is that the party’s base, its soul and 
core, is so hopelessly anchored 
to Trump that to shed the naked 
emperor would be to shed its 
identity. Once Trump became the 
Republican Party nominee in 2016 
and the likes of Graham decided to 
become his loyal minions, the GOP 
became married to Trump. Trump’s 
loss in 2020 will not mean a clean 
divorce. In fact, it won’t even mean 
a separation.

The New York Times’s David 

Brooks said it well in August 
2020. Even in the event of a failed 
re-election, Trump will “still be the 

center of everything Republican. 
Ambitious Republicans will have 
to lash themselves to the husk of 
the dying czar if they want to have 

any future in the party. The whole 

party will go Trump-crazed and 
brain dead for another four years.”

With the exception of a few (and far 

between) principled stands against 

Trump’s lunacy (courtesy of John 

McCain, Mitt Romney and Jeff Flake), 
the GOP sold out to a bombastic 
charlatan who peddled lie upon lie 
upon lie for 48 straight months, and 
made “the greatest country on Earth” 
the dumpster-fire laughing stock of 
the world. Miraculously, Trump still 
remains highly popular amongst 
Republicans. Republican leadership 
— like everyone in their profession — 
are nothing if not self-preservational. 
So long as Trump remains popular 
with the Republican base, he’ll 
remain popular with the Old Guard 
that ultimately embraced him.

The toothpaste is out of the tube; 

Trumpism will triumph.

Biden restored the professionalism 

and dignity befitting of a presidential 
administration.

Opinion

M

issaukee 
County, 
a 

secluded 
community 

in the northern Lower 

Peninsula with a population just 
edging 15,000, is a long way from 
Detroit. According to Google Maps, 
Missaukee County sits over 200 
miles from Motor City, a distance 
that can be covered in about 3 hours 
by car. 

At first glance, there’s nothing 

extraordinary 
about 
Missaukee 

County. It’s just another rural 
community barely noticeable on 
a map. But dig a little deeper, and 
there’s something about Missaukee 
that stands out: It is one of the most 
conservative counties in the state 
of Michigan. According to 2020 
election results, Missaukee voted 
75.9% for President Donald Trump; 
75.8% for Republican U.S. Senate 
candidate John James; and 78.6% 
for U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, 
R-Mich. By contrast, Detroit — 
the largest city in Michigan and 
a solid blue community — voted 
93.5% for former Vice President Joe 
Biden; 90.9% for Sen. Gary Peters, 
D-Mich.; and 92.3% for Rep. Brenda 
Lawrence, D-Mich.

This 
vast 
political 
divide 

between communities like Detroit 
and Missaukee is a phenomenon 
becoming more common across the 
country. As urbanization continues 
and 
cities 
and 
suburbs 
grow 

rapidly, rural areas continue to lose 
both population and power. It is 
becoming increasingly normal for 
one or two concentrated urban areas 
— which usually are predominantly 
Democratic — to wield control 
over an entire state. While urban 
areas continue to expand, taking 
representation away from sparsely 
populated areas, our country is 
forgetting and neglecting rural 
America.

In Michigan, this trend has 

been 
prominent 
for 
decades. 

Metro Detroit, according to the 
land 
boundaries 
delineated 
by 

the 
Detroit-Warren-Dearborn 

Statistical Area, has a population 
of 4.32 million people. This means 
that the greater Detroit region, 
which covers less than 7% of 
Michigan’s land area, accounts for 
over 43% of its population. In the 
November general election, the two 
largest counties in Metro Detroit 
(as well as Michigan), Wayne and 
Oakland, voted 68.0% and 56.2% 
for Biden respectively. Votes for the 
Democratic presidential candidate 
from vastly urban areas are arguably 
what put Biden over the top in our 
state, securing him Michigan’s 16 
electoral votes; the same is true for 
Peters, who also secured Michigan 
by narrow margins.

There is significant evidence 

for this phenomenon in other 
Midwestern 
states, 
too. 
Take 

Illinois, for instance. Illinois has a 
population of roughly 12.7 million, 
but the Chicago metropolitan area 
accounts for a staggering 75% of 
that tally, even though it takes up a 
miniscule 13% of Illinois’ land area. 
In the presidential election, Illinois 
voted 55.1% for Biden, even though 
Trump neared 80% of the vote in 
many of the state’s rural counties. In 
Wisconsin, which borders Illinois to 
the north, the state’s urban areas like 

Milwaukee and Madison carried 
Democrats to victory too, with Biden 
edging Trump by a margin of 20,000 
votes. Minnesota, which voted 
52.5% for Biden, tells a similar story.

Outside of the Midwest, the 

same trend is even more apparent. 
Biden easily won New York’s 29 
electoral votes with nearly 60% of 
the vote, even though the map of the 
Empire State has vast swaths of red. 
Pennsylvania, which was seen as a 
battleground for this presidential 
election, narrowly handed its 20 
electoral votes over to Biden. The 
former vice president unsurprisingly 
ran the table in Philadelphia and 
Pittsburgh, while nearly all of the 
rural areas in Pennsylvania turned 
out in massive numbers for Trump.

Finally, as this trend continues 

in the Midwest and Northeast, it 
has picked up steam in recent years 
in Southern and Western states, 
making it increasingly difficult 
for Republican politicians to gain 
traction. One of the most obvious 
examples of this is the state of 
Virginia. According to UVAToday, 
“Virginia in 2000 was a solid red 
state,” and this year, “its metro 
areas turned it blue for the fourth 
consecutive 
election.” 
While 

President George W. Bush picked up 
a comfortable 52.5% of the vote in 
2000 against Democratic candidate 
Al Gore, Biden had a commanding 
lead in the same state, winning it by 
54%.

Now, political scientists theorize 

that Georgia is the next Virginia. 
Like Virginia, Georgia used to be a 
solidly red state. But the growth of 
the Atlanta metropolitan area has 
moved the state from a Republican 
stronghold to a tossup. While 
Trump won Georgia by comfortable 
margins in 2016, Biden just barely 
prevailed over Trump in 2020, 
garnering 49.5% of the vote. In the 
future, it is quite plausible that like 
Virginia, Georgia will be a solidly 
Democratic state as the population 
continues to shift to urban and 
suburban areas.

Georgia isn’t the only state that 

is demonstrating these population 
shifts. For example, as Arizona’s sole 
urban center of Phoenix continues 
to enlarge, the state has moved 
from the Republican column in 
most elections to an apparent toss 
up. Trump also took Arizona easily 
in 2016 but lost to Biden by slim 
margins in 2020. Nevada, with the 
growing Las Vegas metro area, and 
North Carolina, with the Raleigh 
and Charlotte metropolitan areas, 
are additional clear examples of this 
accelerating trend. While Trump 
won North Carolina in 2016 with 
little trouble, the state was so close in 
2020 that it took days to call. 

As the 2020 presidential election 

becomes a distant memory and 
time goes by, this trend will not 
only continue where it has already 
started, but it will also likely become 
more common in areas where it has 
not. While increased urbanization 
and suburbanization may be seen 
as very favorable to the Democratic 
Party, since America’s cities vote 
reliably Democratic, the deepening 
urban-rural divide creates problems 
on the national scale. For one, rural 
America continues to deal with 

staggering poverty rates, which 
advocacy group Save the Children 
has called an “emergency.” In 2016, 
according to NPR, almost a quarter 
of American children growing up in 
rural areas were poor; meanwhile, 
rural areas have been plagued by a 
lack of quality health care options 
for years, a crisis exacerbated by 
the pandemic. Rural areas continue 
to be increasingly forgotten, and 
these regions aren’t getting the 
representation they deserve.

More and more, conservative 

areas of our country are voicing 
their opposition to liberal power 
centers far away; rural Americans 
are tired of being left behind. In 
left-leaning Oregon, which voted 
overwhelmingly for Biden, a group 
of red counties successfully passed 
a ballot initiative to set in motion 
a process by which they may leave 
Oregon and join Idaho. In Illinois, 
a proposal has been discussed by 
conservative areas to break off 
from liberal Chicago. While these 
conversations are nothing new, 
they have gotten renewed attention 
over the course of the COVID-19 
crisis, as Democratic governors set 
regulations for entire states, which 
includes red areas, to curb the 
spread of the coronavirus.

There is no easy solution to 

solve this problem. It clearly sets 
a bad precedent to allow several 
counties in one state like Illinois or 
Oregon to secede. If that were the 
case, it would only be a matter of 
time before state boundaries in the 
continental U.S. looked radically 
different. Meanwhile, such a trend 
would have drastic logistical and 
political consequences. 

As 
the 
urban-rural 
divide 

continues to exert its influence 
more and more, some people are 
expressing interest in Nebraska 
and Maine’s congressional district 
method to allocate electoral votes 
in presidential elections. While 
most states, including Michigan, 
are 
winner-take-all, 
different 

presidential candidates can win 
different congressional districts 
in Nebraska and Maine. If the 
Electoral College were reformed to 
operate on the basis of congressional 
districts instead of entire states, 
it would take away much of the 
influence of predominantly urban 
areas, since rural districts in blue 
states would typically be won by 
Republican candidates. Such a 
change could hurt the Democratic 
Party in some regions, but it 
would help both Republicans and 
Democrats in obvious ways. For 
example, Texas, Florida and Ohio 
all awarded their electoral votes 
to Trump in the 2020 presidential 
election, but all three of these states 
have significant blue territory 
in urban areas. In a reformed 
Electoral College, while Democrats 
would be harmed in blue states like 
New York and Illinois, they would 
be able to acquire more electoral 
votes from urban centers that aren’t 
represented in red states.

The forgotten segment of society: rural America

EVAN STERN | COLUMN

L

iving in a hyper-divided 
post-election nation, it’s 
easy to forget the feeling of 

unity that existed at the beginning 
of the pandemic. Whether it was 
rallying 
around 
our 
essential 

workers or sharing our desperate 
search for toilet paper, a common 
enemy seemed to unite us, if only 
for a moment. Perhaps my favorite 
example of this is the strangest. 
Throughout the spring and early 
summer, in Denver, where I am 
spending my semester, people let 
out their inner wolf for a minute 
each evening. 

At 8 p.m., as the sun would 

begin to set, a series of scattered 
howls would slowly rise into a 
cacophony that echoed through 
the entire city. Originally intended 
as a sign of support for essential 
workers, it slowly grew to become 
a community-bonding event. As 
we all felt the grueling effects 
of social isolation, calling out to 
each other, especially in such an 
unconventional way, felt like the 
perfect way to express frustration 
and solidarity during a pandemic. 
While this habit has since ended, 
the howling effect may have had a 
lasting effect on some Coloradans 
as they were casting their ballots 
this election. 

On Nov. 3, Colorado citizens 

voted for the reintroduction of gray 
wolves into their state. Proposition 
114, which requires the Colorado 
government to reintroduce wolves 
into the Western Rockies by 2024, 
was the first successful voter-based 
initiative to reintroduce wolves into 
any U.S. state. Colorado will join the 
rest of the Northern Rockies states, 
as well as Wisconsin, Minnesota, 
Washington, Oregon, New Mexico, 
the Carolinas and Michigan to be 
one of the few remaining states 
with wolf populations. 

Before European colonization, 

wolves lived in every U.S. state 
except 
Hawaii. 
Centuries 
of 

deforestation and the carrying 
out of programs aimed at their 
total elimination pushed wolves 
out of every region but two 
slivers of northern Minnesota 
and Michigan by the 1930s. After 
being declared an endangered 
species in 1978, gray wolves 
slowly began to repopulate the 
Northern Great Lakes. Wolves 
immigrating from Canada or 
introduced through conservation 
projects expanded the gray wolf 
population to include the Upper 
Peninsula 
of 
Michigan 
and 

northern Wisconsin.

With an estimated population 

of 4,400, about two-thirds of the 
U.S’s wolves now live in these three 
states. Nearly 700 wolves in 143
packs currently roam the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan. They have 
so far remained in this sparsely
populated section of the state, yet
to resettle the Lower Peninsula.
Even so, wolves have been found
in the Lower Peninsula in two
incidences in the past few decades 
— the most recent in 2015. With
studies indicating that the Upper
Peninsula has nearly reached the
maximum number of wolves that
it can sustain, the likelihood that
these rare examples may one day
result in the recolonization of the
Lower Peninsula is increasing. 

If wolves were to reestablish 

themselves 
on 
the 
Lower 

Peninsula, researchers guess that 
they might end up in one of the 
various state parks that line the 
tip of the mitten. Already home 
to red foxes, whitetail deer and 
black bears, the area contains 
vast forested territories that the 
wolves would need to survive. In 
their absence, much of the nation 

has experienced an overexpansion 
of deer populations and the 
dominance of the invasive coyote 
as a primary predator. Here, they 
would once again fulfill their role 
as the ecosystem’s top predators, 
keeping both populations in check. 
Despite these benefits, spending 
centuries teaching people to hate 
wolves 
has 
made 
convincing 

them to welcome wolves into 
their communities an expectedly 
daunting task. 

Even 
in 
Colorado, 
where 

Republicans were heavily outvoted 
by Democrats, Proposition 114 
passed by 1.2 percentage points. 
Proponents 
of 
the 
initiative 

were 
surprised 
by 
the 
slim 

margins, expecting Denver and 
its liberal suburbs to push it to an 
overwhelming victory. It reflects 
people’s widespread suspicions 
toward an animal many of us are 
first introduced to as “big” and 
“bad.” 
Republican 
politicians 

have long played into these 
misconceived notions in order 
to persecute the canines. When 
they were briefly stripped of their 
endangered species classification, 
and the federal protection that 
comes with it, in 2012, Wisconsin 
Gov. Scott Walker seized the 
opportunity to drastically reduce 
his state’s wolf population and there 
was even an anti-wolf committee 
in the Dep. of Natural Resources. 
During the three hunting seasons 
the state carried out before a 
federal judge redesignated their 
endangered status in 2014, more 
than half of the state’s wolves 
were killed.

BOOK REVIEW
‘The Mirror and the Light’ fits the political climate

Lana Del Rey and 
the mesh mask

Her head makes a dull thud 

as it hits the platform, rolling 
a couple feet away as her body 
teeters 
and 
lurches 
forward, 

swimming “in a pool of crimson, 
the blood seeping between the 
planks.” Queen Anne Boleyn, the 
second of King Henry VIII’s six 
wives, has just been executed on 
charges of high treason, incest 
and adultery. This is the note 
from 
which 
Hilary 
Mantel’s 

novel, “The Mirror & the Light,” 
kicks off. Mantel’s beautiful prose 
and attention to detail builds an 
immersive atmosphere, and her 
rich characterizations resurrect 
long-dead historical figures, their 
tics and quirks shining through 
to 
paint 
distinct 
portraits. 

Eight years in the making, “The 
Mirror and the Light” is the final 
installment of Mantel’s “Wolf 
Hall” trilogy, which documents 
the rise and fall of Thomas 
Cromwell, a blacksmith’s son from 
Putney who became King Henry 
VIII’s most trusted advisor, before 
being executed on charges of 
treason in 1540.

Thomas Cromwell is often 

snubbed by recorded history, 
which typically remembers him 
as a conniving, villainous and 
traitorous lackey of Henry VIII, 
and, indeed, in Mantel’s historical 
fiction trilogy, Cromwell has few 
friends and many enemies. But 
Mantel casts Thomas Cromwell in 

a less one-dimensional and more 
positive light, as an ambitious 
underdog 
trying 
to 
survive 

the whims of a murderously 
mercurial monarch. Eleven years 
after 
beginning 
this 
trilogy, 

Mantel’s grasp on Cromwell has 
ascended beyond that of a mere 
biographer. 
Mantel 
inhabits 

Cromwell’s 
psyche, 
wrestling 

with his doubts, fears, regrets 
and wishes, portraying them so 
convincingly that the reader takes 
on those same fears and wishes. 
The psychological portrait Mantel 
paints of Cromwell is absolutely 
mesmerizing, 
and 
it 
is 
the 

foundation of this tour de force of 
a novel. The reader chases after 
Cromwell as he tries to navigate a 
highly volatile political landscape, 
bodies dropping left and right. 

In spite of the details and 

outcome 
of 
Cromwell’s 
story 

being well known, Hilary Mantel 
manages to keep the reader on 
edge, constantly looking over 
their shoulder, waiting for the 
dagger 
to 
plunge 
into 
their 

back, as it inevitably will into 
Cromwell’s. She does this so well 
by constantly circling back to 
past grudges and mistakes, and 
keeping all those whom Cromwell 
has crossed within his immediate 
vicinity. As Cromwell continues 
to dance around the incompetent 
aristocracy around him, Mantel 
draws out the tension in every 
communication, setback and even 
victory over Cromwell’s enemies. 
She makes the reader well aware 
of the disgust Cromwell’s peers 

have for him and his lowly birth, 
hostility shining through word 
choice and descriptions. 

This 
sense 
of 
foreboding 

pervades every chapter, and what 
soon becomes clear is that time, 
whether it’s the past, present or 
future, is vindictive, and no one 
escapes its grasp. Mistakes of 
Thomas Cromwell’s past echo 
throughout the novel, and there’s 
a sense that he can never quite 
escape those he’s lost along his 
path to survival. Cromwell is a 
man of many talents, and tries 
to not focus on the past, but, 
unfortunately, “the past is always 
trickling under the soil, a slow 
leak you can’t trace.” Shadows of 
his deceased mentor, Cardinal 
Thomas Wolsey, flit across his 
memories at night; the oppressive 
presence of his abusive father 
looms over him in his darkest 
moments; 
memories 
of 
the 

warmth of his dead wife and 
daughter taunt him at his most 
emotionally 
vulnerable. 
“The 

dead,” Cromwell reflects, “are 
crowding us out.” The years weigh 
heavily upon Cromwell, and you, 
the reader, feel it.

But a few of Thomas Cromwell’s 

spectres are the same ones he 
sent to the grave himself. After 
Henry VIII grew tired of Queen 
Anne Boleyn and set his eyes 
on another woman (a pretty 
common 
occurrence 
for 
the 

king), Cromwell was the man 
tasked with trying to dissolve the 
marriage. Though the king was 
the one who wanted Anne dead, 

Cromwell was the one who helped 
build the case that resulted in the 
execution of her and several of 
her alleged lovers. Not only does 
Boleyn’s ghost haunt Cromwell’s 
conscience, but her former allies 
do as well.

Cromwell is keenly aware of 

this, and, even as he rises through 
the ranks of the English court, 
he’s never certain of when his sins 
will catch up to him. Even as he 
tries to temper Henry VIII’s worst 
impulses, there’s an uneasy sense 
that the ground could crumble 
beneath him at any moment. One 
slip up, one miscommunication, 
one failed alliance, and Cromwell 
might be on the chopping block 
himself. Mantel summons this 
fog of uncertainty by wielding the 
ambiguous motives of Cromwell’s 
peers to her advantage. With favor 
of the elite constantly shifting, it’s 
difficult for the reader not to feel 
as unsteady as Cromwell does.

It’s oddly reminiscent of our 

current political landscape, in 
which lives are subject to the 
whims of an unpredictable leader, 
and established officials are ousted 
day-by-day. As one of Cromwell’s 
allies puts it: “We both know what 
it is to serve this king. We know it 
is impossible. The question is, who 
can best endure impossibility?” 
It’s almost comforting, knowing 
that 
the 
turbulent 
times 

we’re 
currently 
experiencing 

aren’t 
unprecedented, 
but 

Mantel ruthlessly exploits the 
undercurrent of fear, engrossing 
the reader further in the story and 

driving home the consequences of 
such a turbulent atmosphere.

The 
fear 
isn’t 
unfounded, 

either. History tells us that the 
life of Thomas Cromwell does not 
end happily: After orchestrating 
Henry VIII’s third marriage, 
and then failing to dissolve that 
marriage when Henry found his 
bride 
unattractive, 
Cromwell 

is charged with treason, and 
sentenced to die. The reader knows 
this from the outset, and it’s just a 
matter of time until that actually 
happens and Cromwell falls from 
grace. The reader’s foreknowledge 
of his fate makes the last section 
of the book all the more poignant: 
After Thomas Cromwell, a nobody 
from nowhere, is made the Earl 
of Essex by the king, it seems that 
he has finally made it out of the 
woods. “He had thought the sands 
of time were running out: running 
through the cracks in the shining 
bowl of possibility he holds in his 

hands. ‘Now all is mended,’ he 
says.” Cromwell, after a lifetime 
of anxiety, would finally be able to 
focus solely on effecting change, 
rather than on merely surviving.

But history ripped the rug 

out from under him, and Mantel 
ensures her readers feel the force 
of that fall. Henry VIII orders 
Cromwell imprisoned, and the 
vultures who have been circling 
Cromwell the entirety of the 
novel are finally able to descend. 
It’s 
difficult 
not 
to 
admire 

Cromwell, so it’s devastating, even 
infuriating, when the futility of 
all his efforts becomes apparent. 
All of these elements — the 
atmospheric, the emotional, the 
political — coalesce into a gripping 
historical drama. Hilary Mantel 
had me enamored with this 
beautiful conclusion to her trilogy.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW
New York Times architecture critic 
talks social change at Taubman

Why does architecture need 

a critic? Intention is never 
outcome, 
and 
a 
building’s 

meaning is never fixed. As 
the stage for all of our lives, 
its subtle impacts can’t be 
overlooked. 
The 
Michigan 

Daily 
sat 
down 
virtually 

with 
Michael 
Kimmelman, 

architecture 
critic 
at 
the 

New 
York 
Times, 
to 
talk 

preservation and affordable 
housing ahead of his virtual 
visit 
to 
Taubman 
College 

Monday night as this year’s 
Raoul Wallenberg Lecturer. 

Starting off with the question 

of preservation — What is its 
value? What does it safeguard? 
In discussing a piece he wrote 
about the Strand Bookstore 
last year, Kimmelman said, 
“It’s not just the building itself 
— the container — but what it 
contains that is actually the 
repository of the community’s 
identity and memory.”

Now, 
Kimmelman 
isn’t 

discounting the look of a 
building — that’s obviously 
important. 
He 
brings 
up 

the 
issue, 
rather, 
because 

current preservation practice 
is 
centered 
around 
just 

that — cosmetics. The NYC 
Landmarks 
Preservation 

Commission, 
founded 
in 

1963, is, in his words, an 
“architectural 
bulwark” 

against alterations to its city’s 
historic facades. It lays no 
claim, however, to interiors nor 
the institutions that occupy 
them. 

On second thought, this 

makes sense. A government 
agency shouldn’t be playing 
favorites in the private sector. 
But Kimmelman points out 
that it’s not unprecedented nor 
nontraditional to the way our 
government functions on the 
level of the individual: 

“It’s 
really 
dangerous 

territory when the city begins 
to favor some kinds of private 
businesses over another, but 
we have to do it anyway, with 
tax incentives and other kinds 
of benefits,” he said.

“Places like San Francisco, 

where 
businesses 
are 
also 

threatened by runaway rental 
costs, have created funds and 
other mechanisms to provide 
a handful of businesses the 
opportunity of getting some 
assistance,” said Kimmelman. 
“It’s essentially intended to say 

to businesses on the cusp of 
closure, ‘we’ll give you enough 
to tide you over, but you’re 
not going to become a public 
institution.’”

Kimmelman 
is 
referring 

here 
to 
San 
Francisco’s 

Legacy Businesses Program 
started in 2015. Through it, 

businesses open 30 years or 
longer can apply for grants if 
they can also prove they’ve 
made “a significant impact 
on the history or culture of 
their neighborhood.” It’s by no 
means collusion, but it is a bit 
of favoritism.

Moving on to affordable 

housing, I told Kimmelman 
about Ann Arbor’s Proposal C 
on the ballot on election day. 
Prop. C was a one-mill property 
tax for the construction of 
approximately 1,500 units of 

affordable housing over the 
course of 20 years, and it passed 
with a 73% vote. In lieu of these 
promising results, I asked him 
if he thought New York City 
had sufficient rent-controlled 
and subsidized housing. 

“Well, that’s a short answer: 

no,” he said. Subsidized housing 
had been largely in the hands 
of private developers since the 
Nixon 
administration. 
This 

has 
undeniable 
advantages, 

but also makes public good 
dependent on private profit. 

In 
short, 
he 
eventually 

said, “we can’t continue to 
be in a situation where we 
don’t 
invest 
in 
affordable 

housing for people because the 
ramifications are enormous on 
the rest of the economy. Health 
problems, 
homelessness 

problems, problems of policing 
and 
crime, 
mental 
health 

problems…” the list goes on. 

Kimmelman 
has 
been 

waving the red flag on issues 
like these since his first piece 
under his current role in 2011 
called, “In a Bronx Complex, 
Doing 
Good 
Mixes 
With 

Looking Good.” In that piece, 
he wrote about Villa Verde, an 
unusual public housing project 
for 
its 
distinguished 
look, 

amenities like an on-site health 
clinic, and, correspondingly, a 
high cost per square foot.

Noble as its aims may have 

been, such expenditure didn’t 
come without criticism for 
the 252-unit complex in a 
neighborhood 
with 
66,450 

people per square mile — 
almost 40% living below the 
National Poverty Line.

“If 
you’re 
a 
housing 

advocate, and there’s such a 

shortage of housing, that extra 
money could have gone to 
more units instead of to better 
design. So there was some 
debate as to whether it was an 
efficient use of funds, I think 
there’s an argument that it 
was,” Kimmelman said.

The 
architects 
and 

developers wanted a project 
that 
signaled 
what 
public 

housing could be. Kimmelman 
suggests that it achieved that — 
it doesn’t blend into its context, 
it sits loudly at the foreground. 
It shows what happens when 
architects and developers meet 
community members where 
they are. As he says in the 
article, “What is that worth?”

Kimmelman acknowledges 

in his writing that architecture 
itself doesn’t solve poverty 
and unemployment. But it has 
immeasurable value in uplifting 
the spirit and instilling a sense 
of pride in place. This extends 
far beyond housing: “public 
space, streets, parks, schools, 
transportation… they all work 
together to provide a decent, 
healthy life for people,” he 
said.

Kimmelman will be speaking 

in greater depth on these issues 
Monday night at 6:00 p.m. 
with Taubman College Dean 
Jonathan Massey as well as 
the college’s Dimensions and 
Agora student publications. As 
the Wallenberg lecturer, the 
conversation will be centered 
on “architecture as a humane 
social art.” Registration is free 
and open to the public via this 
link.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

MADELEINE GANNON

Daily Arts Writer

Editor’s 
note: 
Del 
Rey 

responded on Nov. 17 to clarify 
that the mask worn during the 
book signing included a plastic 
lining. Her response can be found 
on Twitter.

It all started at a book signing 

in Los Angeles, Calif., where 
pop icon Lana Del Rey read 
passages of her new poetry 
book, “Violets Bent Backwards 
Over the Grass.” 

Pictured on Twitter: Lana 

Del Rey in a mesh face mask. 
Then all hell broke loose. 

In a move surprising to none, 

criticism from fans came down 
hard and fast. Most (if not all) 
of the comments emphasized 
the irresponsibility of Del Rey’s 
choice of mask during a global 
pandemic. The nature of the 
event made the incident more 
incriminating –– a book signing 
by nature involves intimate 
one-on-one social interaction, 
and multiple photos of Del Rey 
posing with fans only added fuel 
to the fire. Swift as a California 
forest fire, Del Rey’s Twitter 
fans tore her down. 

Here, 
a 
familiar 
pattern 

breaks 
out: 
cancel 
culture. 

Social media has allowed a 
system of extremes to develop, 
an 
environment 
where 

declarations of allegiance are a 
necessity to claim “citizenship” 
of “woke culture.” If you don’t 
love somebody, you have to 
hate somebody –– the middle 
ground is no longer acceptable. 
Judgement calls can be made 
by anyone, anywhere, anytime. 
Online platforms act as personal 
megaphones. Often, the loudest 
voices are not the most accurate 
voices. And when it comes time 
to bring the gavel down and 
mete out justice, it becomes the 
shot heard around the world. 

Can 
we 
still 
love 
our 

icons 
when 
they 
become 

“problematic?” This is often 
asked in a global culture which 
is increasingly black-and-white 
when it comes to identifying 
what behavior is right and what 
behavior is wrong. Questions 
whispered 
in 
layered 
guilt 

by fans who have found their 
favorite icons suddenly struck 
from favor. In a way, online 
justice 
feels 
as 
fickle 
and 

unyielding as that of an emperor 
or king.

Now, Del Rey stands before 

the chopping block, and her 
legions of fans watch in fear and 

anticipation to see if her “head 
will roll” next. Does a mesh mask 
disqualify her from our love? 
It seems such an insignificant 
misstep for an idol who the 
world has cherished for so long. 
But the pandemic has killed 
hundreds of thousands of people 
–– a number so large, it seems 
unfathomable. Mask etiquette 
has become synonymous with 
compassion, intelligence and 
human 
decency. 
Del 
Rey’s 

fashion choice feels like a slap 
in the face for those who have 
been intimately hurt by COVID-
19 and for those who wear their 
masks without issue. Celebrity 
status does not exclude Del Rey 
from responsibility. 

Other 
whispers 
online 

have suggested that Del Rey 
glamorizes abusive and toxic 
relationships; 
some 
have 

accused the artist of being a 
secret 
“Trump 
supporter,” 

going so far as to say that Del 
Rey’s American vintage style 
is indicative of her personal 
politics (“Harken, ye old glory 
days”). However, all of these 
accusations and musings on 
the internet are just that –– 
whispers. One can’t help but 
wonder if fans and critics alike 
are simply fishing for some fresh 
meat to bite. With tensions high 
and safety protocols demanding 
frequent isolation, the spotlight 
turned towards the internet. 
Everyone loves a good Twitter 
fight, too. 

Should Del Rey be deemed 

“problematic” by the “high 
courts” of the internet? Do we 
abandon her completely? Do we 
shun her music and her poetry? 
Does 
this 
become 
a 
hard 

break-up, with deleted phone 
numbers and zero contact? Or 
is it a cowardly retreat, where 
Del Rey is publicly shamed and 
ostracized in daylight while the 
world continues to indulge in 
her music as a guilty pleasure.

This article poses a lot of 

questions, I know. Cancel culture 
paints itself as progressive and 
self-reflective: On the positive 
side, society has learned to hold 
the powerful accountable, to 
critique the heroes and reflect 
on how their larger-than-life 
reputations 
actively 
shape 

reality; on the other hand, 
cancel culture can be trigger-
happy, overeager to place blame 
while 
enabling 
(sometimes 

anonymous) 
individuals 
to 

boost their own egos by tearing

Contrary to popular belief, the 

multi-cam sitcom isn’t dead. 

Several cameras centered around 

one set to simultaneously record a 
scene. It’s an easy, painless setup 
that was popularized in 1951, when 
“I Love Lucy” won the hearts of 
the American public and left a 
permanent imprint on our 
digital culture. Since then, 
the multi-camera setup has 
given birth to some of the 
most iconic moments of 
our country’s history. From 
“Seinfeld” to “Friends” to 
“The Big Bang Theory,” it 
is impossible to discuss the 
story of television without 
it. 

Yet, 
throughout 
the 

last decade, the cultural 
relevance of this production 
style 
has 
undeniably 

dwindled. 
Single-camera 

comedies like “Community” 
and “The Office” have 
ushered in a new norm for 
television humor, without 
laugh tracks or flat visual 
styles. It’s a medium that 
has fared far better among younger 
audiences. I hadn’t introduced 
myself to a new multi-cam sitcom 
in years.

Nevertheless, pressing play on 

the pilot for CBS’s latest “B Positive” 
felt strangely comforting. There’s 
a sentimentality in the style. It can 
be argued that it exists purely on 
nostalgia, but the palatable format 
just makes starting a new show so … 
effortless.

It’s ironic, then, that a series 

so 
seemingly 
lighthearted 

is built around such a dark, 
dramatic premise. Drew (Thomas 

Middleditch, “Solar Opposites”) 
is a divorced father in need of a 
new kidney. Facing his potential 
death, he struggles to find someone 
supportive enough to give him their 
own. That is, until he runs into Gina 
(Annaleigh 
Ashford, 
“American 

Crime 
Story”), 
an 
airheaded 

substance abuser with a heart of 
gold. At a mutual friend’s wedding, 
Gina drunkenly re-connects with 
Drew over a vague high school 

friendship and spontaneously offers 
him her own kidney. 

Thus, an odd couple is formed. 

If Drew wants to live, he must help 
Gina stay sober. If Gina wants to do 
good, she must defeat her addiction 
to drugs and alcohol.

Along with a heavy setup, the 

pilot teases at jokes that stray far 
from where its peers are often 
comfortable going. When the doctor 
recommends a family member 
for the kidney transplant, Drew 
remarks, “Oh great, a Republican 
kidney.” There are references to 
Xanax use, visible bongs and even 

cocaine dust. The show’s opening 
credit sequence, most notably of all, 
is fantastically disturbing and gory. 
(Seriously, check it out).

Politics, gore and drug abuse are 

all things that you don’t often find 
directly in multi-cam sitcoms. In no 
way would I call the first episode a 
failure (I am certainly intrigued to 
see where they take it), but I’d have 
to imagine it’s not going to be easy 
to strike a working groove with the 

medium chosen. Even so, 
I’m glad to see risks taken 
and 
envelopes 
pushed 

in a format that so many 
consider outdated. 

“B Positive” exists in a 

weird space of time where 
the future of multi-cam 
comedies 
is 
uncertain. 

Though “The Big Bang 
Theory” put up numbers as 
high as “Game of Thrones” 
last year, there is most 
definitely a feeling in the 
air that the style has lost its 
vigor.

While I’m not overly 

optimistic that “B Positive” 
will 
be 
the 
show 
to 

change that stigma, some 
genuinely 
interesting 

seeds were planted. I hope 

they continue to take risks and 
find their foothold in the Golden 
Age of Television. To say that 
this past week was stressful is an 
understatement. I found it difficult 
to focus on anything, whether it was 
homework or watching a lecture for 
more than 30 minutes. But recently 
I’ve rediscovered something very 
special: the Charlie Brown holiday 
specials. I know these are important 
parts of the holidays, but for 
whatever reason I had completely 
forgotten about them — until now.

Netflix’s ‘Jingle Jangle’ 
makes Xmas exhausting

Christmas 
comes 
earlier 

every year. The day after 
Halloween, nowadays, 
plastic 
trees 
and 

twinkle lights fill store 
shelves, 
DJs 
across 

the world queue up 
Mariah Carey’s classic 
Yuletide 
anthem 

and 
Starbucks 
puts 

gingerbread in their 
coffee. In 2020, this 
seemed like a welcome 
distraction. 
The 

Holiday Season began 
as a warm, colorful 
respite 
from 
the 

pandemic and election 
uncertainty.

Then 
came 
the 

Netflix 
film 
“Jingle 

Jangle.”

Watching 
“Jingle 

Jangle” is like being 
dragged 
behind 
the 

Polar Express, curb-
stomped by Ebenezer 
Scrooge and, finally, 
run down by Santa’s 
sleigh, all while the 
shrill laughter of elves 
fills your ears. 

Forest 
Whitaker 

(“Rogue One: A Star Wars 
Story”) 
plays 
an 
inventor 

named 
Jeronicus 
Jangle, 

who has lost the Christmas 
spirit and turned his once 
wonderful 
toyshop 
into 
a 

dilapidated 
pawn 
shop. 
It 

is up to his granddaughter, 
Journey, played by Madalen 

Mills 
(“Reality 
Cupcakes”), 

to breathe festive life into his 
dusty heart and even dustier 

store. 

They live in a place called 

“Cobbleton,” 
which 
is 

appropriate, as the story is 
completely cobbled together 
from other Christmas films. 

The power of belief 
from 
“The 
Polar 

Express,” 
Santa’s 

toyshop and a barely 
remixed version of “A 
Christmas Carol” are 
thrown into a faux-
iron pot with a large 
helping of steampunk 
flavor 
and 
musical 

numbers a step below 
even the worst made-
for-TV movies. 

Whenever the music 

swells, one braces for 
it. Every song goes on 
at least a minute too 
long, and the lyrics 
and 
instrumentation 

are 
the 
kind 
one 

hears waiting in line 
at a crowded, sweaty 
department 
store, 

last-minute 
gifts 
in 

hand, 
wondering 
if 

this whole Christmas 
thing is really just an 
expensive 
waste 
of 

time. 

It could’ve worked. 

Whitakter 
is 
great 

in the film, as are Madalen, 
Keegan Michael Key (“Key and 
Peele”) and the rest of the cast. 

The set design, costumes and 
visual effects are immaculate. 
The movie’s snowy, clockwork 
Victorian aesthetic is unique, 
and quite beautiful. There’s a 
robot named Buddy 3000 who, 
even if he skews a little too 
close to WALL-E, is absolutely 
adorable.

Still, 
“Jingle 
Jangle” 
is 

almost sickening, like a pile of 
over-iced Christmas cookies 
shoved right in your face. 

The film is devoid of any 

sort of bite. There is not one 
scene in “Jingle Jangle” where 
one wonders, even just for a 
moment, if things will turn out 
alright. There’s just smiling, 
and singing, and smiling and 
singing, and more smiling and 
more singing. It’s exhausting. 

“Jingle 
Jangle” 
may 
be 

marketed 
for 
a 
younger 

audience, but that doesn’t mean 
there shouldn’t be conflict. 
Christmas classics like “Frosty 
The Snowman” and “Rudolph 
the Red Nosed Reindeer” still 
have active antagonists, and 
moments of threat or peril, to 
give a hint of winter chill that 
makes the Yuletide warmth of 
Christmas so comforting. In 
November 2020, sugary sweet 
won’t cut it. 

Additionally, 
the 
sci-fi 

element of the movie ranges 
from silly to disturbing. The 
magic 
system 
of 
Jangle’s 

word is a mixture of math 
and 
mysticism: 
Characters 

draw glowing equations in 
the air (a la “Doctor Strange”) 
and perform equations like 
the “Square root of possible.” 

That’s the silly bit. 

More upsetting is a sentient 

toy named Don Juan, bizarrely 
played 
by 
Ricky 
Martin 

(“American 
Crime 
Story”), 

who is created, and (spoiler 
alert) 
shut 
off, 
essentially 

“killed,” by Jangle at the end 
of the film. Jangle says Don 
Juan will be reprogrammed to 
be more obedient. A life with 
agency, emotion and sentience 
is extinguished, and everyone 
smiles away. Whenever I watch 
“A Christmas Story,” the last 
thing I say is “This needs just a 
bit more existentialist horror.”

If one is looking for a Holiday 

escape, stay far, far away from 
Cobbleton.

Highlights from this year’s 
virtual Polish film festival

In its 27th year, the Ann 

Arbor Polish Film Festival has 
been virtualized as a result of 
COVID-19. The slate of shorts, 
feature films and documentaries 
are streaming on the Michigan 
Theatre website in lieu of live 
screenings. One of this year’s 
feature films is “Jak Najdalej Std,” 
or “I Never Cry” in English. 
Written and directed by 
Piotr Domalewski (“Silent 
Night”), the film explores 
the cruelly ubiquitous loss 
of a parent through the eyes 
of a young woman. “I Never 
Cry” prompts the viewer to 
reconsider their role in the 
lives of others. 

Ola (Zofia Stafiej, “25 

Years of Innocence”) is 
seventeen years old, and 
desperately wants a car. She 
has failed her driving test 
three times (though the last 
failure was definitely not 
her fault), and can’t afford 
to take the test a fourth 
time. She wouldn’t be able 
to afford a car, either, but 
her father promised to send 
her the money as soon as she gets 
her license. Ola’s dad is in Dublin, 
working for a shipping company 
and sending money home to 
Poland where Ola lives with her 
mother (Kinga Preis, “53 Wars”) 
and brother (Dawid Tulej) who 
has a disability. Coincidentally, 
Ola misses a call from her father 
during driving test number three, 
and finds out later that same 
day that there was an accident 
involving a shipping container. 
Her father had been crushed.

Thus begins Ola’s journey. 

Since her mother does not speak 
English, Ola must be the one to 
fly to Ireland and retrieve her 
father’s body. At 17, Ola must 
rescue a man she hardly knew 
from the purgatorial bureaucracy 
of death. Confronted by long lines, 
expensive cigarettes and unfeeling 
doctors, the Polish teenager must 
grapple with the life lived by her 
father, independent of his role as 
absent patriarch. Through such a 
struggle, Ola gains perspective on 

herself in relation to others.

“I Never Cry” is a poignant 

meditation 
on 
loss 
and 
the 

sometimes 
strange 
distance 

between kin. As she meets the 
people who knew him, Ola seeks 
to reconcile the father she knew 
with the man she did not, but 
comes away with little more 
than limp placation: “He did his 
best.” Despite the mundanity of 
this remark, uttered first by the 
foreman of the shipping company 
where her father worked, it 
becomes something of an anchor 

for Ola as she faces her father’s 
flaws, flaws which help Ola 
come to terms with her father’s 
interiority and selfhood. A life 
only appreciated in death is the 
film’s sad irony. 

As a coming of age tale, the 

film 
has 
an 
unconventional 

rawness. The challenges faced 
by 
the 
protagonist 
are 
not 

contrived, rather all too real. Ola’s 
growth culminates in a moving 
catharsis at the film’s end, as her 

relationship with her 
father is grounded in 
personal 
significance. 

As a criticism of a very-
contrived 
bureaucracy, 

the film lands precise 
blows. 
Investigating 

all of the gratuitous 
processes 
surrounding 

death, civid, sacred and 
social, 
Domalewski 

recenters the emotional.

Watching 
Ola 

endure the death of her 
father in international 
isolation, those of us in 
some degree of COVID 
isolation may be able 
to 
empathize. 
Those 

who have lost a parent 
can 
empathize 
with 

Ola on another level. 

No matter one’s situation, the 
viewer is encouraged to pause 
and appreciate the lives of others, 
especially the lives of our parents. 
As we tumble through even the 
most quotidian bureaucracies of 
modern life, seeing the interiority 
and humanity in one another 
demands a concerted effort, one 
we all ought to eagerly make. 
Contrary to popular belief, the 
multi-cam sitcom isn’t dead.

some form of me reciting my own 
version of Bane’s quote from “The 
Dark Knight Rises”: “You merely 
adopted the internet; I was born in

To say that this past week was

I found it difficult to focus

It is wonderful that

perfectly 
spaced 
out. 

In October I watched 
“It’s the Great Pumpkin, 
Charlie 
Brown,” 
and 

this weekend I watched 
“A 
Charlie 
Brown 

Thanksgiving.” 
I 

thoroughly enjoyed both 
and was smiling the 
whole time through. 

I’m 
used 
to 
watching 

Disney-Pixar 
movies 
where 

the animation is crazy detailed 
and creepily realistic. Charlie 
Brown is the opposite of this, 
but to me, it’s still incredibly 
immersive. 
Movies 
like 

“Monsters Inc.” and “Toy Story” 
are gorgeous and comforting 
in their own right, but Charlie 
Brown 
feels 
particularly 

nostalgic. 
Its 
simplistic 

animation is whimsical and 

endearing, and I think part of 
Charlie 
Brown’s 
everlasting 

charm. There’s a reason Charlie 
Brown has remained a favorite 
for so many after all this time. 
It’s rather obvious what makes 
these specials so delightful, but 
since I hadn’t watched either of 
them in so long, I was surprised 
at how much I still liked them. 
The animation and color palette 
are beautiful and feel like 

they’re right out of the comics. 
That silly spirit is captured so 
well through the icons that 
are Charlie Brown, Lucy, Sally, 
Snoopy and more. They exist 
in a world where their parents’ 
voices are replaced by a muted 
trombone. These specials are 
solely from the perspective of 
children. This adds to their 
dreamlike 
quality, 
making 

them truly feel like an escape. 

One thing that absolutely 

defines these specials is Vince 

Guaraldi’s 
music. 
Guaraldi 

initially composed for Charles 
M. Schulz for a documentary 
about 
the 
Peanuts 
comics 

called “A Boy Named Charlie 
Brown,” and since then he has 
become integral to the Charlie 
Brown legacy. After watching 
the specials, I found myself 
putting the soundtracks on 
while I studied because they’re 
so peaceful. 

I also appreciate how 

short 
these 
specials 

are. At 30 minutes each, 
watching one of them is 
not a big commitment. 
Finding time to watch 
anything 
is 
difficult, 

and especially at times 
when focus is hard to 
come by. During election 
week 
in 
particular, 

anytime I tried to sit 
down and relax I was 
instantly 
distracted 

by my phone to check 
the polls. “A Charlie 
Brown 
Thanksgiving” 

is only 30 minutes, and 
it goes by so quickly! 
As soon as December 
comes, 
I’m 
going 
to 

watch “A Charlie Brown 
Christmas,” and I highly 
suggest that you do too. 

We’re all unsure what these 

coming months will look like. 
This semester has been so 
different from what it should 
have been, and I know I’ve been 
trying to find ways to make 
things feel normal. Full of 
nostalgia and joy, these Charlie 
Brown specials are a sure-fire 
way to lift anyone’s spirits, and 
who doesn’t want that?

The K-pop queens of vocals 
stage a forgettable return 

The goddesses of vocals, 

Mamamoo, return for their 
crown with their new mini-
album, Travel. Their recent 
track of success with “HIP” 
and Hwasa’s “Maria” 
created 
incredibly 

high 
expectations 

for this album. Aptly 
titled, 
the 
project 

takes inspiration from 
a plethora of music 
from 
around 
the 

world, ranging from 
the ’70s aesthetic in 
the U.S. to traditional 
Middle Eastern music. 
They 
were 
quite 

adventurous 
with 

their 
internationally 

inspired 
stylistic 

choices; some of them 
were used to a great 
synergistic 
effect, 

although other times 
the 
results 
sounded 

tacky. 
While 
their 

vocals are perfect, as 
always, there is an 
overall sense of complacency 
and 
mediocrity 
across 
the 

album — two things that do 
not represent Mamamoo well 
at all.

The mini-album begins with 

“Travel,” a laid-back, chill 

summer-bop with the cliché 
high-pass filter. It’s nothing 
revolutionary. 
Moonbyul’s 

melodic rap perfectly weaves 
in and out of the otherwise 
very ordinary and basic song. 
The 
song 
has 
the 
classic 

Mamamoo slowed-down beat 
rap verse in the middle of the 

song, then ramps back up to the 
chorus. Even the bridge is very 
formulaic, the instrumentation 
is 
more 
sparse 
and 
the 

vocalists trade lines. Overall, 
“Travel” is as forgettable as it 
is unoriginal.

The next song makes up for it, 

though. “Dingga” is everything 
“Dynamite” by BTS wished 
it was. The bouncy bassline 
is infectious and invites the 
listener to groove with the 
song. Strings join in for the 
chorus which has a really full 
and rich sound, and it’s really 

groovy. It combines bass 
drum hits on every beat 
with syncopated disco 
elements that create a 
compelling 
rhythmic 

drive. 
Hwasa’s 
and 

Wheein’s voices lend well 
to this song, as Hwasa 
brings her sexy sultry 
style, and Wheein really 
comes into her own as 
a distinct voice in the 
group.

The title track, “Aya,” 

seems to rely more on the 
word “Aya” than an actual 
melody 
to 
be 
catchy. 

The flute motif of “Aya” 
pervades 
throughout 

the song and carries it 
melodically (I definitely 
can 
see 
it 
becoming 

the 
subject 
of 
many 

TikToks 
and 
memes). 

The build-up of the pre-chorus 
to the chorus generates great 
expectations, but the anti-drop 
of the chorus is anticlimactic 
and disappointing. The third 
and fourth verses are the 
silver lining of the song. The 

introduction of the low brass in 
the beat gives it a sort of Latin 
pop flavor — it’s definitely a 
killer combination. The faster 
tempo 
dance 
break 
seems 

tacked on, like a last-ditch 
effort to generate some sort 
of variety within the song, 
and the ending is sudden and 
dissatisfying. 

“Chuck,” 
“Diamond” 
and 

“Goodnight” carry the album. 
“Chuck” is a unique sound for 
K-pop: It starts with a breathy, 
raspy, quieter singing style 
complemented by a stripped 
back synth beat. The chorus 
features heavier instrumentals, 
but 
it’s 
incredibly 
catchy. 

It is such a dramatic and 
effective 
sound 
when 
the 

group harmonizes and slides 
up to a chord, and it really 

showcases 
how 
wonderful 

they are as vocalists. “Chuck” 
also highlights a sexier side 
of Solar’s voice that we really 
only got a glimpse of in her 
single “Spit it Out.” 

“Diamond” is badass. The 

beat is slow but confident. 
The lyrics are slurred and 
seem to form one long string 
of beautiful melody. There are 
some really funky harmonies 
in there too — the pre-chorus 
to the chorus shifting from the 
G major to A major 7 gives a 
dreamy, ethereal quality to the 
music.

The queens of the emotional 

ballad strike again with “Good 
Night,” and do not disappoint. 
In 
an 
oversaturated 
field, 

filled with incredibly talented 
K-R&B 
artists, 
Mamamoo 

still manages to stick out. 
Mamamoo fills the song with 
their 
angelic 
voices, 
and 

heaven may actually sound like 
this.

Travel fails where it needs 

to succeed; its most important 
songs, the first and the title 
track, 
are 
lackluster 
and 

leave a lot to be desired. The 
other songs on the album 
are fantastic but don’t quite 
make up for it. Mamamoo has 
consistently been putting out 
music throughout quarantine, 
and frankly some of the songs 
on this album sound like they 
are burnt out. Maybe they 
should take a well-deserved 
break.

‘The Shadow King’ on our 
memory of war, violence

The 
author 
of 
one 
of 

the 
Guardian’s 
“10 
Best 

Contemporary African books” 
has 
made 
a 
triumphant 

contribution to the literary world 
with her pre-WWII epic “The 
Shadow King.”

Shortlisted for the Booker 

Prize for Fiction, Maaza Mengiste 
remakes and rebirths Homeric 
mythology in 1930s Ethiopia, 
embarking on an evaluation 
of war, trauma and memory. 
Covering a lightly fictionalized 
Second 
Italo-Ethiopian 
War, 

Mengiste documents Mussolini’s 
invasion of Ethiopia and the 
people’s resistance.

Usually war novels attempt 

to hold your heart and emotions 
hostage, harming you with an 
onslaught of devastating events. 
However, 
Mengiste’s 

novel 
is 
a 
beautiful 

and 
relatively 
non-

traumatic read. Pulling 
from both history and 
Greek tragedy, Mengiste 
transforms her forgotten 
conflict into a new Iliad, 
complete with capricious 
higher 
powers, 

irresponsible 
kings 

and 
fighting 
women. 

By 
including 
mythic 

elements 
(repeated 

Greek chorus chapters, 
allusions, etc.), Mengiste 
helps muffle the dark 
topics native to wartime: 
war, 
rape, 
assault, 

extreme violence.

On one side, fascist 

Italy is ramping up their late 
imperialism. 
With 
better 

weaponry and technology, the 
Italians hope for an easy victory. 
However, Ethiopia is not an 
easy prize to be won, plundered 
and stolen. Out of necessity 
and national pride, Ethiopian 
generals and households rally 
for war, echoing the Greek 
Basileus (kings) who kept their 
oath to retrieve Helen of Troy in 
Homer’s “The Iliad.”

The epic begins with the 

main character Hirut fingering 
through a box of photos taken 
by an Italian war photographer. 
Through the pictures, Hirut 
and Mengiste recall trauma and 
violence. And it is through Hirut 
that Mengiste interrogates how 
one can physically survive battle 
and emotionally cope with its 
trauma. Hirut begins untouched 
and 
unmarred 
before 
the 

beginning of the war. She lives 
a small existence on the edge of 
an Ethiopian estate. Having lost 

her parents, she has seen little 
of the world beyond the estate 
she works on. Over the course 
of the novel, her naivete hardens 
and she evolves into a soldier. 
However, Hirut is an abnormal 
protagonist. Mengiste is not 
pracious with Hirut. Often, her 
narrative leaves Hirut behind to 
explore other, more interesting 
characters. In one scene, Hirut 
is pointedly ignored by two 
embracing 
characters. 
While 

another author might delve into 
Hirut’s 
feelings 
of 
rejection 

and confusion, Mengiste does 
not indulge Hirut. Hirut is not 
clever or particularly pretty. She 
is not the center of the story. By 
excluding Hirut’s feelings from 
the narrative, Mengiste signals 
that Hirut herself is tertiary 
to the larger tapestry of war, 
plunder 
and 
Ethiopia 
being 

woven. 

Menguste’s 
disregard 
for 

Hirut is brilliant. It’s one of the 
most daring literary choices 
made by an author in a long time.

Goodreads reviews reacted to 

Mengiste’s tactical disregard by 
taking umbrage, misinterpreting 
Mengiste’s distance from Hirut 
as negligence. Usually, main 
characters are celebrated or 
special in some way. Mengiste 
does not coddle Hirut or indulge 
her thoughts and hopes. Instead, 
Mengiste deposits the same 
opaque, archetypal figures from 
myth into her story. Just as you 
do not know Achilles or the 
Euripides’ constant thoughts, 
you are similarly shut out from 
Hirut’s perspective. Like Homer 
and Aeschylus, Mengiste makes 
you privy to Hirut’s primal rage 
and confusion but keeps her 
psychology a secret. She does 
this to cleave Hirut and the 
Ethipidans closer to legend. She 
forces the audience to observe 
and question the impact of 
violence and wartime.

If enduring is only one way 

through violence, how can we 
ensure that the violence doesn’t 
pillage our bodies and person? 
Is there a way to escape war 
physically and mentally intact? 
Are there metaphysical human 
conditions that get torn out of 
ourselves during wartime?

As 
a 
contrast 
to 
Hirut, 

Mengiste also follows Ettore, a 
Jewish Italian war photographer 
whose psyche and psychology 
is very clearly laid out. He is 
an invader on the other side 
of the war, commissioned to 
photograph 
the 
triumphant 

Italians. But within the war and 
the Italian front, he is unsafe. 
Anti-Jewish 
sentiment 
seeps 

from Italy into Ethiopia and 
Ettore is anxious and morally 
conflicted about the atrocities 
commited against the Ethopians. 
However, paralyzed by fear that 
Italy’s violence will be turned 

against him, Ettore tries 
to keep his head down 
as he documents the 
war. At his best, Ettore 
is uncomfortable. At his 
worst he is complicit. 

Whereas Hirut and 

her 
cohort 
become 

immortalized, 
Ettore 

remains 
desperately 

small 
and 
human, 

a 
witness 
to 
others’ 

greatness. If Hirut and 
the Ethiopians represent 
the 
subjects 
of 
the 

mythology, Ettore is the 
scribe. 
Continuously 

taking 
photos 
and 

documenting the war, 
Ettore keeps the themes 
of legacy and legend 

alive.

His photography facilitates 

the Second Italo-Ethiopian War’s 
transformation into a legend, 
using his camera and viewfinder 
to create main characters and 
sell a narrative to Europe and 
Ethiopia, producing propaganda 
and stories to sate curiosities.

Mengiste, through a variety 

of angles, transmutes her novel 
and national history into a myth. 
Whereas most myth retellings 
try to turn the myths into a 
novel, Mengiste does the reverse. 
She immortalizes the fighting 
females of Ethiopia in the form of 
lyrical prose. She constantly and 
cleverly embeds allusions and 
includes a Greek chorus in her 
novel, planting a consciousness 
of legacy and legend. Startling, 
mythic and vivid, Mengiste’s 
novel wakes up your senses 
without harming you.

Finding warmth in Charlie 
Brown holiday specials

JUDITH LAWRENCE

For The Daily

While their vocals 

are perfect, as always, 

there is an overall 

sense of complacency 
and mediocrity across 

the album — two 
things that do not 

represent Mamamoo 

well at all.

Is there a way to 

escape war physically 

and mentally 

intact? Are there 

metaphysical human 
conditions that get 
torn out of ourselves 

during wartime?
 

Full of nostalgia and 

joy, these Charlie

sure-fire way to lift 
anyone’s spirits, and 
who doesn’t want 

that?


The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
14 — Wednesday, November 18, 2020 
statement

Last Saturday I stood in Chicago, across 

the river from Trump International Hotel 
& Tower, surrounded by a crowd of strang-
ers. I’d found out the election results half an 
hour earlier, by way of a CNN push notifica-
tion, on the 23rd floor of my dad’s apartment 
building. Within minutes, the honking and 
cheering pouring through the 12-inch glass 
window was too loud to ignore. I saw the ca-
maraderie as an undeniable invitation to the 
celebration, ditched the homework I’d begun 
only minutes before, grabbed my camera and 
jumped in the elevator. 

I arrived onto the scene at Wacker Drive, 

a little out of breath after sprinting down 
Michigan Avenue. Small clusters of people 
milled around, eyeing each other excitedly. A 
woman walked past in front of me; noticing 
we had the same mask and smile hidden be-
hind it, I raised my camera to take her photo. 
She paused mid-stride and looked directly 
at me, framed almost perfectly by the raised 
Wabash bridge beyond her. The irony was 
too good. 

(The Wabash Bridge, the only way to the 

base of Trump Tower, has been raised on 
and off for weeks “as part of a precautionary 
measure to ensure the safety of residents.” 
The street remains closed down a block be-
yond the tower, enforced by a multitude of 
maskless Chicago police officers.) 

The woman passed through the frame, 

then, seeing the excitement in my eyes and 
body language, turned around to chat. 

“I didn’t know where to go or what to do!” 

she said, breathlessly. “I just found out the 
results and I wanted to be with people, so I 
came here.” 

She wasn’t alone in that sentiment. I 

stayed, watched and photographed for two 
hours on Wacker as more people streamed 
in, taking note of the growing festivities: Cars 
pulled over to take videos, three different 
people popped bottles of champagne, some-
one played “The Wicked Witch is Dead” over 
their speaker, the crowd sang “We Are the 
Champions” not once but twice, a drummer 
set up shop, a city worker dedicated his shift 
to driving his street cleaner back and forth, 
honking relentlessly. 

Oh, the joy. It radiated from everyone in 

the crowd, almost none of whom knew each 
other. Eventually, the police blocked both 
sides of the street to traffic, triggering an im-
promptu block party. It seemed as if in that 
moment, like the woman I briefly spoke to, 
everyone wanted to be with people. But why?

***
In times of high emotion, whether posi-

tive — like joy, excitement or relief — or nega-
tive — like loss, pain or grief — humans have 
always come together. We hold protests, 
vigils, riots, rallies, and celebrations, among 
many other gatherings. 

LSA senior Amytess Girgis, a student or-

ganizer who works with the Lecturers’ Em-
ployee Organization and a variety of student 
organizations fighting for equity and justice, 
has helped organize many different func-
tions for these purposes.

“Our primary focus, when organizing 

gatherings is to create pockets of liberation, 
where people can envision the world as it 
should be,” she said. “And so what that looks 
like is creating accessible spaces. Spaces 
where folks with any kind of need can have a 
presence and not feel like some kind of bur-
den or unwelcome. We create spaces of joy … 
and then, of course, it’s bringing speakers in 
that can inspire folks and tell stories. But ul-
timately, the types of community gatherings 
I want to be a part of are the ones that tell the 
story of who we want to be and help people 
believe that that’s possible.”

The emotions I felt on Wacker Drive were 

exactly that: I was seeing, and participating 
in, a future that I hadn’t thought was possi-
ble four years ago. First and foremost, it was 
a collective sigh of relief that our democracy 
wouldn’t be toppled. Then, at least for me, it 
was a reinforcement that love, acceptance, 
inclusion, diversity, morality and empathy 
were still alive and persevering in our coun-
try. 

This wasn’t an organized protest, or even 

an organized gathering. It was a completely 
spontaneous gathering of people of every 
ethnicity, sexuality, gender identity and age. 
We’d previously only felt that joy in micro-
cosmic spaces we’d deliberately constructed. 
Suddenly, those spaces bled together in the 
Chicago streets as a celebration of shared 
freedoms. 

“To me, fundamentally, humans reach 

their most joyous selves with other humans,” 
Girgis told me. “And when we gather in spac-
es to celebrate our ties, even if those ties are 
from common struggle, we are creating the 
hope that, at least at the end of the world, we 
can still love each other.” 

Yet as endearing of a sentiment that is, our 

nation is as divided as we’ve ever been. There 
was an entire demographic of the country 
not celebrating in America’s streets last Sat-
urday — one that instead had their moment 
in November 2016. The concept of celebrat-
ing shared principles and values isn’t limited 
to one side, but right now, it seems to be one 
side at a time. 

The Black Lives Matter movement, found-

ed by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal 
Tometi in July 2013, has long used protesting 
in the streets to form coherence around the 
treatment of Black people in America. This 
past year, America exploded into anger after 
the killings of George Floyd in May and Bre-
onna Taylor in March, with 74% of Ameri-
cans saying they support the protests and 15 
to 26 million people participating in them. 

But the movement quickly fell prey to the 

“Black is thug” narrative, which evolved into 
“Black protest is riot.” By definition, rioting 
is a form of gathering. Sometimes it’s a crowd 
out of control. Sometimes it’s a deliberate 
tactic of deterrence, like at the University of 
Mississippi in 1962, when a white crowd ri-
oted to block James Meredith, the first Black 
student at Ole Miss, from attending classes. 
Rioting’s historical significance and current 
narrative have been marred by those who 
deem it an illegitimate form of expression. 

“The reason why the Black Lives Matter 

protests were immediately billed as riots is 
because of how we define violence in a coun-
try like America, and in many other places 
that lean heavily on capitalist ideologies and 
racist ideologies,” Girgis explained. “And by 
that I mean that violence on property is the 
equivalent to violence on real bodies. Vio-

lence on the stock market is the equivalence 
of violence on real bodies.” 

It’s true that small riots have spurned from 

protests this past year. But it’s also true that 
historically, rioting has been perpetrated by 
people of all races, not just Black communi-
ties, and as a movement, Black Lives Matter 
has largely decided to fight inequity and in-
justice with love and community. 

“By combating and countering acts of vio-

lence, creating space for Black imagination 
and innovation, and centering Black joy, we 
are winning immediate improvements in our 
lives,” their mission statement reads. 

Its principles are clear, and its materials 

readily available for people to utilize in or-
ganizing a community event, rendering the 
movement impossible to pin down. It can’t 
be eradicated — it’s not just an organization, 
but a community of people who believe in 
a better future, organizing tangible spaces 
where that belief rings true. 

Joy has been part of Black resistance for 

a long time. “We can actively trace the spa-
tial and temporal control of Black expression 
from slavery and colonialism through to to-
day,” wrote Chanté Joseph in Vogue this past 
summer. “This is why the act of joy is resis-
tance and as we use our physical bodies to pro-
test, march and demand change, we must also 
use them to experience the pleasure of joy.” 

For BIPOC in America, and around the 

world, just existing is an act of resistance. 
Girgis pointed out how central oral traditions 
are to these communities — music, dance and 
art are embedded in their protest. “‘We Shall 
Overcome’ is one of the most famous move-
ment songs of all time that sort of carries the 
waves of the civil rights movement,” she said. 

On Saturday, the music leaned a little more 

toward “FDT” by YG and Nipsey Hussle — 
cars drove past with the song blaring, drench-
ing the crowd in an energy and freedom they’d 
been missing. That energy couldn’t be con-
tained. And perhaps “FDT” is less traditional 
than “We Shall Overcome,” but the sentiment 
still remains the same: A community’s art and 
culture is woven into the way it decides to 
gather together. 

In the Candlelight Revolution of 2016 and 

2017, millions of South Koreans took to the 
streets every Saturday for 20 straight weeks, 
demanding President Park Geun-hye’s res-
ignation and the upholding of democracy. 

The protests were entirely peaceful, focusing 
around art and entertainment. Youngju Ryu, 
associate professor of Asian Languages and 
Cultures at the University of Michigan, teach-
es a class titled “The Candlelight Revolution: 
Democracy and Protest in South Korea,” and 
spoke to me about the impact of the incredibly 
successful demonstrations.

“Throughout the day, this space became 

the destination for anyone who wanted to 
express themselves,” she said. “You had a lot 
of homespun posters, a lot of performances, 
like puppet shows, you had incredibly satiri-
cal examples of what we would call ‘laughtiv-
ism.’ So people could go and just walk around 
and enjoy all these examples of creative and 
politically engaged voices, and then collec-
tively come together in the evening, listen to 
speeches by prominent figures and sing to-
gether.”

She continued to speak about a sort of col-

lective effervescence found in these scenes. 

“The spectacularity of a million people, 

holding up those candles together ... is some-
thing that became an essential part of show-
ing, first of all, how many people there are, 
and how beautiful it is … I think what helped 
the protests is, again, kind of understanding 
the nature of a large crowd like that, and mak-
ing sure that they remain entertained.” 

Almost a third of South Korea’s population 

turned out in the cold winter, week after week 
— so much so that Ryu noted a sense of loss 
after the impeachment was victorious. After 
20 weeks of turning out together in pursuit of 
a common goal, they suddenly found them-
selves with free Saturdays. 

“What’s bringing people together?” Ryu 

asked. “A strong sense of mission for pro-
tecting democracy that was hard fought and 
hard won ... faith in the power of the masses 
to bring about such a change, because they’ve 
done it before.” She continued, “They have 
this kind of relationship to democracy that I 
think is more visceral because they experi-
enced authoritarianism in their own lifetime. 
Many of them fought against earlier, authori-
tarian regimes in their youth. And so the de-
mocracy that they have is something that they 
have to protect — that they won with their 
own hands.”

n 
January 
15, 

2020 — a day 
that history will 

remember for the grim pro-
cession delivering two arti-
cles of impeachment to the 
Senate of the United States 
— I first read an article 
written in 1937 by my great-
grandfather, Otto Schirn, 
titled “Chancellor Schus-
chnigg’s Work.”

Four months earlier, I 

had come across a strange 
document in my grand-
mother’s 
photo 
album 

about her father’s European 
life. Though I had always 
thought of my great-grand-
father 
as 
an 
Austrian-

Jewish refugee — a simple 
academic who was incred-
ibly lucky to escape in 1941 
with his life — the yellow, 
faded document claimed 
that he was so much more 
than that. “As a journalist,” 
it said. “Dr. Schirn had spo-
ken against the Nazi gov-
ernment.”

I never met Otto; he died 

six years before I was born. 
His life had affected me only 
through the loving memories he left with 
my grandmother and mother. But as soon 
as I read those words, I knew I would have 
to dedicate months of my life to rediscov-
ering Otto’s history. It hinted at a story too 
powerful to be left untold.

From my grandmother’s files, I learned 

that Otto turned to journalism after four 
years searching for an academic post. A 
member of the Vienna University’s in-
augural economics doctoral class, Otto 
would later write to my grandmother of 
the “casual anti-Semitism” that made a 
teaching career impossible.

Otto spent a year studying journalism in 

Brussels before he was hired as the Vien-
nese correspondent for “L’Indépendance 
Belge,” a left-wing Belgian newspaper. He 
was given the pen name Marcel Legrand 
to disguise his Jewish identity. From May 
1937 to February 1938, he chronicled the 
fall of Austria’s right-wing fascist party as 
Austria became part of the Third Reich.

In his reporting before “Chancellor 

Schuschnigg’s Work,” Marcel began to es-
tablish two dominating themes that would 
carry through the rest of his reporting. 
The first was the hidden motive behind 
all Austrian political developments: Aus-
tria’s fight for independence from an in-
creasingly aggressive German state. Mar-
cel wrote of this struggle as the tragedy it 
would soon become.

The second theme was the increasingly 

violent strain of anti-Semitism that was 
taking root both inside and outside Aus-
tria’s borders. It was an aggressive institu-
tionalization of the casual anti-Semitism 
Otto first witnessed in his days at the Vi-
enna University. As he wrote in his second 
article, Europe would soon face a “Jew-
ish problem” as Britain closed Palestine’s 
borders to European Jews and Germany 
sought to instigate the next diaspora.

This reporting took place against a 

backdrop of domestic unrest. Austria’s 
chancellor, Kurt Schuschnigg, was a not-
ed authoritarian. History would later de-
scribe Schuschnigg’s brand of far-right 
Austrian nationalism as Austrofascism. 
His predecessor, Engelbert Dollfuss, had 

seized power by forcing the police to sus-
pend Austria’s legislature. After Dollfuss’s 
assassination by 10 Austrian Nazis, Schus-
chnigg’s chancellorship became focused 
on maintaining Austrian independence, 
quashing Austrian Nazism and suppress-
ing political dissent.

Though in the beginning Marcel sup-

ported Kurt Schuschnigg, he did so with-
out acknowledging his anti-democratic 
tendencies. He wrote of Schuschnigg as 
the defender of Austrian independence, 
the defender of Austrian Jews in the face 
of the violence that lurked on the other 
side of Austria’s border.

But in the article I read on January 15, 

I watched my great-grandfather’s opinion 
evolve. For the first time, he admitted his 
support for an illiberal political figure. 
“Authoritarianism without dictatorship!” 
read the article’s subtitle. I wondered if it 
was written with any sliver of sarcasm.

“After the tragic death of Dollfuss,” 

Marcel began. “Austria found itself at a 
very dangerous turning point in its post-
war history. The whole country was still 
under the impression of the National So-
cialist coup d’état.”

In two sentences, Marcel summarized 

Schuschnigg’s powerful response. “Al-
though naturally hostile to the ideas of 
dictatorship and violence, [Schuschnigg] 
understood that Austria’s exceptional 
circumstances warranted an authoritar-
ian government. This is what he achieved 
without resorting to measures of violence 
that would be repugnant to the Austrian 
people.”

I was horrified by the contradiction I 

found in this paragraph, a contradiction 
that carried through Marcel’s full body 
of reporting. It was the same contradic-
tion that I see taking place today, the slick 
realpolitik that sacrifices precedent and 
principle for the perception of raw politi-
cal power, the failure to defend the under-
lying principles of our electoral system in 
hopes of avoiding the wrath of an outgo-
ing party leader.

For my great-grandfather, of course, 

the stakes could not have been higher. In 
1945, he learned that his sister had died of 

pneumonia. A few months later, he learned 
his parents had during their transport to 
Auschwitz. Though he remembered them, 
Josef and Tauba, they died at 61 and 62, 
two names among the thousands trans-
ported from Malines that day. 

While writing as Marcel, I believe my 

great-grandfather thought Schuschnigg 
was the only person that could prevent 
the Nazis from destroying his homeland. 
Marcel was willing to give up his belief 
in checks and balances, legal rights — the 
very principles of democracy — in hopes 
that Schuschnigg might preserve Austria’s 
independence. He was willing to sacrifice 
all moral principles in hopes of prevent-
ing history’s inevitable outcome: the An-
schluss, the fall of Austrofascism and the 
rise of an Austria Nazi government.

As I questioned this moral equivoca-

tion, I thought about the life Otto went 
on to lead in the United States. Why did 
Otto Schirn, the Austrian-Jewish refugee 
behind the Los Angeles Holocaust Me-
morial, once supported an authoritarian 
chancellor? Why had this academic, who 
lectured on behalf of civil rights in the 
early 1950s, support one of the main per-
petrators of Austrofascism? 

Marcel’s position required a cynicism 

and realism I found chilling. Didn’t he be-
lieve that Austria could choose between 
democracy and Nazism? Couldn’t he see 
that Nazism would only grow stronger, 
that it would become more normalized 
in the sinking democratic power vacuum 
Schuschnigg’s party had helped create?

The comparisons to the politics of con-

temporary America, Otto’s adopted home, 
seemed obvious. There was the normal-
ization of racism that accompanied the 
confirmation of judges, the degradation 
of ethical norms that accompanied mi-
nor tax cuts. Decades of moral principles 
sacrificed for modest policy advances, a 
deeply-entrenched political party putting 
forward a platform of blind fealty. 

As I look at the choice Otto once made 

to forfeit morality in pursuit of an end 
goal, I see a reflection of the choice Amer-
ica’s leaders make every day. I can only 
hope they do so while knowing how hard 

it will be to rebuild.

But the more I compare 

these two devil’s bargains, 
the more I am forced to 
acknowledge their differ-
ences. In Otto’s case, he 
was a fake Belgian journal-
ist, an Austrian Jew writ-
ing under a pen name. It 
was Hitler’s Nazism, not 
Schuschnigg’s 
national-

ism, that forced Otto to be-
come Marcel.

Unlike our contempo-

rary leaders, Marcel’s re-
porting did not normal-
ize “very fine people” on 
both sides of Austria’s 
existential fight for in-
dependence. Marcel ac-
knowledged Schuschnigg’s 
authoritarianism for what 
it was. He did this while 
drawing a distinction be-
tween nationalist illiberal-
ism and hate-based racism 
that would soon turn into 
genocide.

Nevertheless, I imag-

ine Otto spent the rest of 
his life questioning his 
support for fascism in the 
buildup to the Anschluss. 
After nearly a year spent 
researching Otto’s life, I’ve 
come to accept that I will 
question my great-grand-
father’s decision for the 

rest of my life.

And after watching America’s vot-

ers defeat the strongest, most blatant as-
sault on American democracy in recent 
memory, I realized that many politicians 
and civil servants must be asking them-
selves the same question. How did they 
allow their desire for power or their fear 
of speaking out to eclipse their allegiance 
to our Constitution-based democratic sys-
tem?

Over the past week, various political 

leaders have attempted to cast doubt on 
the factual underpinnings of this elec-
tion. Lawyers have worked tirelessly to 
peel away votes from a specific candidate. 
Though my great-grandfather’s report-
ing makes me fearful for the health of our 
democracy, I take solace in the 5 million-
vote margin that separates our govern-
ment from the fragile ego and destruction 
of one man.

In Marcel’s world, after all, there was 

no election to save morality. Schuschnigg 
and his opponents could operate without 
any fear of a referendum on their poli-
cies. Once lost, Austria’s political morality 
could not be easily rebuilt.

As if to prove this point, I noticed a 

phrase in an article Marcel wrote a month 
before the Anschluss. The goal of this ar-
ticle was to summarize Schuschnigg’s 
political legacy; toward the end, Marcel 
mentioned Schuschnigg’s most recent do-
mestic policies. 

In all the documents that I’ve read 

about Marcel’s time, I can think of no bet-
ter example of the everlasting damage of 
compromised morality. I fear that Ameri-
ca’s current political climate has similarly 
paved the way for dictatorial destruction 
in the years to come.

Marcel still supported Schuschnigg’s 

fascism at the time of his penultimate ar-
ticle. He viewed it as a bulwark against 
the Nazis. But it was of Schuschnigg’s leg-
islation before the Anschluss, not Hitler’s 
genocide after the Anschluss, that Marcel 
wrote of a chilling new political develop-
ment: “the threat to confine all disturbers 
of social peace to concentration camps.”

Gazing into my 
great-grandfather’s 
shadow

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
statement

I don’t consider myself a religious per-

son, but I had the closest thing to a spiritual 
awakening when I first climbed up the olive 
steps leading to South Fourth Avenue’s most 
charming hideaway — a place with tingling 
espresso aromas, walls adorned with matcha-
colored greenery and a heavenly soundtrack 
of scholarly chatter and prickly indie tunes: 
Literati Coffee. It was my first semester of 
college, and per a self-made tradition, I had 
set aside every Wednesday afternoon before 
my Women’s Studies lecture to explore the 
abundance of coffee shops Ann Arbor had to 
offer. 

Every Wednesday, one shop at a time. 

This week’s pick was a fancy-sounding place 
called Literati Coffee, tucked just above its 
sister storefront, Literati Bookstore.

I reached the top of the bookstore’s worn 

steps, only to turn the corner and discover a 
strikingly peaceful corner of campus I never 
even knew existed. The experience felt tran-
scendent: I had crossed the threshold from a 
university town buzzing in the excitement of 
changing fall colors and an anticipated foot-
ball season to the serene nirvana found just 
above Literati Bookstore. And so, I entered, 
perhaps floating a foot off the ground all the 
while.

True Literati enthusiasts will tell you that 

securing a window seat is a challenging yet 
noble task. The general makeup of the cof-
feehouse’s customer base consists of astute-
looking millennials and pensive bibliophiles. 
So, inching your way to one of the store’s 
treasured window-hugging tables means 
shuffling through a sea of wool coats, plaid-
patterned winter wear and finicky ceramic 
espresso cups. Yet, I suppose my spiritual 
awakening had ushered in a kind of seren-
dipity, and so, upon crossing the divide from 
University-haze to Literati-nirvana, I had a 
glistening window seat waiting just for me.

With an iced, almond-milk latte — my go-

to order, sitting contently next to my Spanish 
coursebook — I was convinced I had found 
my own little slice of happiness on campus. 
I spent the afternoon catching up on class-
work and humming along to my favorite 
playlist, blissfully content with the lingering 
taste of espresso that rested on my tongue.

Later in the afternoon, as if planted by a 

divine spirit or maybe even a romantic movie 
producer, a young man walking on the street 
below caught my eye contact and waved. I 
couldn’t help but feel elated by that small ex-
change — it was the purest little demonstra-
tion of love I had experienced since moving 
to Ann Arbor earlier that fall. 

During my freshman year, leading up to 

and after my Literati discovery, I approached 
my coffeehouse crawl with a particular zeal. 
With weeks of scouting out Ann Arbor’s 
best coffee joints, starting with the ever-
convenient Espresso Royale then venturing 
to other shops sprinkled across downtown, I 
quickly discovered that my quest was about 
something more than coffee. It was in these 

varied spaces that I had some of my best 
hustled study sessions, feverishly outlining 
my next Spanish paper or studying for an 
upcoming statistics exam. More important-
ly, these spaces also allowed me to engage 
in mindful experiences: a lovely interaction 
with a friendly barista, spending a few min-
utes gazing at the colorful patrons passing in 
and out, or even sneaking pictures of the art 
that kissed the walls. 

In this way, I think coffeehouses occupy 

a truly unique purpose somewhere between 
the frigid atmosphere of University academ-
ic buildings and the commercial craze of Ann 
Arbor’s retail and dining scene. These shops 
serve as a safe haven away from the busied 
streets of campus, offering a sacred kind of 
anonymity I began to really cherish. As a Res-
idential College student part of intertwined 
living and academic communities, it became 
difficult to draw the boundary between work 
and play within East Quad Residence Hall, 
where the RC is housed. So, when I started to 
venture beyond East University Avenue and 
explore coffeehouses all across town, this 
ritual became my time to decompress and 
observe the culture of the city beyond my RC 
bubble.

Ultimately, one of the coffeehouse’s most 

impressive assets is its versatility. While I 
might frequent these shops to indulge my 
reclusive romantics, they also serve as a hub 
for social gathering and even political discus-
sion. This beloved “coffeehouse culture,” ac-
tually dates back to the 16th century, when 
Oxford academics would gather in coffee-
houses — hotly referred to as “Penny Univer-
sities” — and partake in the elitist, scholarly 
conversations. 

London’s coffeehouse culture continued 

to grow in popularity into the 18th century 
as Londoners sought leisurely conversation, 
political debate and networking amid their 
stuffy work lives. With the distribution of 
newspapers becoming more widespread in 
the city, coffeehouses were soon positioned 
as hubs of printed news and up-in-coming 
intelligence. In 1675, King Charles II went as 
far as proclaiming the shutdown of all coffee-
houses, stating they “produced very evil and 
dangerous effects,” and were a “disturbance 
of the peace and quiet realm.” However, his 
outcry proved ineffective: The people con-
tinued to gather, drink coffee and indulge in 
an café-bred sense of authenticity. 

And they continue to gather today, just 

with more laptops and less top hats involved.

U-M students have utilized the city’s of-

fering of coffeehouses in a myriad of ways, 
christening the coffeehouse space as a kind 
of library turned living room turned campus 
hub. LSA sophomore Nicole (Nori) Pham 
frequented the late Espresso Royale on 
South University Avenue for all sorts of rea-
sons, from studying to drinks with friends to 
networking. I sat down with the fellow cof-
fee lover (via virtual call) to discuss all things 
Ann Arbor coffee, wanting to hear how she 

chose to utilize these spaces. 

“I always went to the South U (Espres-

so Royale) because I love the atmosphere 
there,” Pham said. “There was a basement, 
(and) I would just sort of sit there in between 
my Bio class and my Physics class. … I would 
spend almost every day there.” 

Pham even became a regular with the 

baristas, which eventually earned her “large 
(drinks) even when I ordered a small. They 
were just super friendly.” 

As a pre-Med student, Pham also valued 

the way Espresso Royale offered a space for 
professional pursuits. 

“I would always set up interviews and 

stuff at Espresso Royale,” she said. “It was 
just a very convenient location to have, 
(where you could) have fun with friends, or 
study, but also have that professional side 
where you could connect and network with 
other members of the Michigan community.” 

Other coffeehouses, like Literati, can serve 

a different niche for students who, like me, 
are a sucker for the romantic nature of the 
space. Public Policy senior Miriam Chung, 
another member of the unofficial official Li-
terati fan club, told me about her passion for 
the shop. 

“I love the smell and touch of books,” 

Chung said. “Even though I wouldn’t buy 
them because I’m broke constantly, I would 
linger around the store and pick up books, 
read the first few pages, move on, repeat.”

She reminisced on the same, divine Lite-

rati bookstore-to-coffeehouse threshold that 
I once crossed as a freshman. 

“What (I) mainly miss about it, it’s that 

the most interesting people used to come 
into Literati — people watching provided a 
fantastic break from studying,” Chung said. 
“I loved how people from all ends of the 
spectrum of interests and book tastes would 
congregate together in that packed, teeny 
upstairs space.”

From the sleek, scholarly tables of Lite-

rati Coffee to the endearingly worn booths 
of Espresso Royale, University students are 
finding their own corners of solitude or hap-
piness or community. And with this great 
variety of espresso-centered environments 
comes a need to differentiate between all 
that Ann Arbor “coffeehouse culture” has 
to offer: Are you team Literati? Espresso 
Royale? Vertex Coffee Roasters? RoosRoast? 
Lab? Sweetwaters? 

As a freshman, I made the bold attempt 

to differentiate between all these spaces 
through a ranking built on the following cri-
teria: the quality of their iced, almond-milk 
latte (my signature drink), the strength of 
their Wi-Fi and the amount and type of seat-
ing offered.

After extensive on-site study and cof-

feehouse scouting, I collected the following 
data: The Espresso Royale on South Uni-
versity had pretty average Wi-Fi but great 
seating if you could snag a booth upstairs. 
Comparatively, the Espresso Royale on State 

Street had an extremely finicky Wi-Fi signal 
but a plentiful offering of cushy booths, ta-
bles, and couches. Lab had minimal seating 
but is often championed as the best coffee on 
campus (personally, their roast is too strong 
for me).

Alas, with its insanely tasty lattes, reliable 

Wi-Fi signal, and overall serene atmosphere, 
I ultimately decided on Literati Coffee as the 
supreme coffeehouse on campus, and have 
been a proud member of team Literati ever 
since. 

Perhaps via less formalized ranking sys-

tems, other students have secured their “go-
to” spots as well. Engineering sophomore 
Paul Balko has been frequenting Lab since he 
first visited on his tour of campus. Now, he 
says, “Lab is my favorite just because of the 
atmosphere and their big selection of fun, 
different lattes and house-made syrups.”

He, too, said he has has been able to dif-

ferentiate between campus coffeehouses in 
ways that are, perhaps, more practical than 
mine. “To blatantly compare (Lab) to Espres-
so Royale, I think the coffee is higher quality. 
I never really liked Espresso Royale. My first 
impression of it was that the name was really 
bad.” 

Whether the name was bad or not, the 

signature, yellow “Espresso Royale” slogans 
still remain emblazoned on their storefronts, 
like sad fossils from a pre-pandemic campus. 
And other coffee joints including Literati 
have joined Espresso Royale in a similarly 
tragic fate, closing their doors to adhere to 
Washtenaw County COVID-19 regulations. 
To coffeehouse enthusiasts or many U-M 
students, this news means a lot more than 
just grappling with a world where one can’t 
purchase an over-priced latte every day.

For students like Balko, closed coffee-

houses means, “the loss of a convenient and 
multi-functional space.” And for Nori Pham, 
a boarded-up Espresso Royale means termi-
nating an opportunity she once always had to 
decompress between classes and exchange 
niceties with friendly baristas. Ultimately, 
during a semester where students are already 
feeling the edge of virtual learning and strug-
gling to stay motivated, the loss of the coffee-
house feels like another harsh blow against 
a version of college some of us already had 
a taste of.

As cheesy as it may sound, just searching 

for pictures of Literati Coffee’s interior to 
inform this article elicited a dull pang in my 
heart. I see these images and can almost feel 
like I’m there again climbing a flight of stairs 
toward a tucked-away nirvana as if Literati 
was placed there just for me — a wandering 
freshman from Indiana struggling to become 
acclimated in a new city on a new campus. 

I know — or rather, I hope — that one day 

these spaces will be available once again, for 
other unknowing freshmen to discover and 
cherish and maybe even learn more about 
themselves in. Because, if done right, the cof-
feehouse crawl can be a truly magical thing.

Mira Shane aims to foster Michigan’s 

next generation in coaching role

For four years, Mira Shane 

was the best goaltender in 
Michigan women’s lacrosse 
history. And now, just 18 
months later, she’s making the 
return to Ann Arbor. 

Shane finished her career 

as Michigan’s all-time leader 
in 
career 
victories, 
saves 

and save percentage. Now, 
Shane is returning to her 
college town as a volunteer 
assistant coach to help out the 
Wolverines’ goalkeepers. 

After spending last season 

coaching at Harvard, Shane 
hopes to bring her “energy” 
and “good vibes” to Michigan. 
Aside from simply helping 
build enthusiasm on the field, 
Shane is looking forward to 
creating strong bonds with 
the goalkeepers, helping them 
improve both on and off the 
field. She also understands 
that her athletes have lives 
outside of their sport. 

“Every other coach told 

me that I wasn’t able to do 

my music,” Shane said. “I 
wouldn’t be the player that 
I had been without music. 
I (knew that I) would have 
support staff and a coaching 
staff that would see that 
(music) was important to me. 
I had other facets to who I was 
as an athlete.”

Now, as a coach, Shane 

recognizes that relating to 
the goalies and asking them 
how they’re doing is just 
as important as improving 
technical 
aspects 
of 

goalkeeping.

 “Going from Harvard to 

here, I’ve kinda taken the page 
of listening to my goalies,” 
Shane said. “I think it goes 
back to that point about really 
trying to relate with whatever 
the athlete is going through.”

At the end of the day, 

athletes walk away from the 
game 
with 
memories 
and 

feelings, not just the physical 
skills. 
It’s 
something 
she 

experienced first-hand during 
her collegiate playing career. 
In the last three minutes 
of her final game, a NCAA 
Tournament matchup on her 

home turf, Shane dove in 
an attempt to make a save, 
dislocating 
her 
shoulder 

on the play. By this time, 
the Wolverines were losing 
by an insurmountable goal 
differential.

With tears in her eyes — 

maybe due to her physical 
pain, 
maybe 
due 
to 
the 

sadness of her college career 
ending — Shane was flooded 
with 
the 
many 
memories 

of her time at Michigan: 
memories of making amazing 
saves on the field, of hanging 
out with the members of her 
a capella group, of advocating 
for mental health awareness 
across 
campus 
and 
of 

speaking up for social justice 
and opportunity for all. 

Mira Shane returns to Ann 

Arbor with years of playing 
experience and a season of 
coaching under her belt, and 
she’s ready to support her 
athletes both on and off the 
field. It was the support that 
made the difference for her 
as a player. Now, it’s the same 
support that will help shape 
Michigan women’s lacrosse.

For The Daily

Harbaugh’s message after blowout 
loss: ‘We’re not very good right now.’

Michigan handles Arizona State, 3-0, to 

sweep series
Kent Johnson already looks the part

When Jim Harbaugh spoke 

with 
the 
media 
following 

Michigan’s 49-11 evisceration 
at the hands of Wisconsin on 
Saturday night, his message 
was accountability.

“We were thoroughly beaten 

in every phase,” Harbaugh 
opened, still settling into his 
place at a lectern beneath 
Michigan 
Stadium. 
“Didn’t 

really do anything well. And 
did not play good, did not 
coach good.

“… Not a good place as a 

football team right now and 
that falls on me.”

For Harbaugh, it was a 

unique tone to match a unique 
low point of his tenure. In 
past defeats, his lesson has 
been myopic. Michigan has 
had 
bad 
games, 
showings 

where Harbaugh felt his own 
performance wasn’t up to 
snuff.

But rarely has he taken a 

macro view of his team and 
admitted that the Wolverines 
simply aren’t very good.

On Monday morning, that’s 

the message he carried into 
meetings with his players.

“We’re not very good this 

year, as our record shows,” 
Harbaugh 
said, 
according 

to junior cornerback Gemon 
Green.

Harbaugh 
wasn’t 
telling 

his 
players 
anything 
they 

didn’t 
already 
know. 
On 

Monday, 
both 
Green 
and 

sophomore safety Daxton Hill 
acknowledged that Michigan 
isn’t where it needs to be.

“This is really my first 

(time), having a losing record 
and all that,” Green said. 
“Even growing up in PeeWee I 
never had a losing record.”

But the point of Harbaugh’s 

message wasn’t to kick his 
team 
while 
they’re 
down. 

It was to tell them to take 
advantage of this adversity. 
It’s 
a 
situation 
Michigan 

didn’t expect to be in — its Big 
Ten title hopes, New Years’ 
Six Bowl hopes and more out 
the window by week four — 
but the Wolverines “still have 
the opportunity to be the best 
players we can be,” according 
to Green.

“It’s 
a 
faith 
in 
each 

individual player and each 
individual coach,” Harbaugh 
said. “And collectively as a 
team … keep pushing. You’re 
gonna find a way. You’re 
gonna find out what works, 
you’re gonna break through. I 
think there’s so many athletes 
that have realized greatness in 
athletic performance and in 
sports, a lot of areas of life isn’t 
perfection, 
it’s 
overcoming 

adversity and obstacles. That’s 
what we’re striving for.”

And for a team filled with 

underclassmen 
starters, 

proving yourself for the future 
— as a team and as individuals 
— means something.

“I wanna lead (the players),” 

Harbaugh said. “I want them to 
hear my voice and understand 
what the objectives are gonna 
be each and every day.”

Right 
now, 
the 
first 

objective 
is 
changing 
the 

energy 
surrounding 
this 

team. It’s painfully clear — 
to Harbaugh, to his players, 
to anyone watching on TV 
— that the Wolverines’ body 
language 
Saturday 
night 

embodied a losing team. From 
Joe Milton’s first interception 
on Michigan’s first offensive 
snap, Harbaugh stood with 
his hands on his hips, staring 
forward. His team reflected 
that energy, reacting to their 
rare 
positive 
plays 
with 

muted claps and to the far 

more common negative ones 
with drooped shoulders and 
silence.

“We came out flat, so just 

gotta 
continue 
changing 

the energy,” Hill said. “Not 
keeping the same energy but 
changing the energy on the 
sideline in the game, come 
out strong. That’s the biggest 
key of this game, whoever has 
the momentum first is gonna 
determine the outcome of this 
game.”

It’s 
jarring 
to 
hear 
a 

Michigan player say energy 
is key to the outcome of a 
looming game against Rutgers. 
In Harbaugh’s five years, the 
Wolverines 
have 
outscored 

the Scarlet Knights, 256-37.

This year is different. On 

the season, Rutgers has been 
outscored by five fewer points 
than Michigan has. Unlike 
the Wolverines, the Scarlet 
Knights beat Michigan State. 
Both schools have lost to 
Indiana, but Rutgers did so by 
one fewer point.

Still, Michigan is 81 spots 

higher in ESPN’s SP+ rankings. 
It opened as a 10-point favorite 
and a loss, even in Piscataway, 
would be somewhat shocking.

But it’s imminently possible 

in a way it never previously 
has been.

“Who knows what next 

Saturday (holds),” fifth-year 
senior defensive tackle Carlo 
Kemp 
said 
Saturday. 
“We 

might be in a dogfight, we 
might be winning by a lot, 
might be losing by a lot.”

To avoid the third option, 

Harbaugh knows his message 
needs to click.

“Eventually (the objective) 

is 
going 
to 
be 
Saturday, 

winning that football game,” 
Harbaugh said. “Everything 
that we can do by all means 
necessary to put ourselves in a 
position to win.”

Following an 8-1 win on 

Saturday in which the Michigan 
hockey team controlled play for 
nearly the entire game, it was fair 
to wonder if the Wolverines could 
do it again. 

The Wolverines put those 

questions to bed almost as soon as 
the puck dropped Sunday night.

It only took two and a half 

minutes for the Wolverines to get 
on the board. After they opened 
play controlling the puck in the 
offensive zone, freshman forward 
Thomas Bordeleau threw a soft 
backhand on net from the right 
circle. Sun Devils goaltender Cole 
Brady gave up a long rebound that 
freshman forward Kent Johnson 
quickly deposited in the back of 
the net. 

No. 
12 
Michigan 
(2-0) 

continued to dominate play in 
the offensive zone, resulting in a 
3-0 win over No. 15 Arizona State 
(0-2).

“Everything’s 
executed 

really well. Lots of skill,” junior 
goaltender Strauss Mann said. 
“Every team gets a certain 
amount of opportunities a game 
but when you have as much skill 
as we have offensively and also on 
the D end, it’s pretty likely to go in 
the net.”

The story for the Wolverines 

was once again their freshmen.

After Johnson tallied their 

first goal, he was crucial to 
their second. Over the final two 
minutes of the first period, the line 
of Johnson, freshman forward 
Matty Beniers and senior forward 
Jack Becker was dominant on 
the forecheck and spent over a 
minute controlling the puck in 
the offensive zone to wear down 
the Sun Devil defense. Eventually, 
with five seconds left in the 
period, Beniers found sophomore 
forward Eric Ciccolini in the slot 
from behind the net. Ciccolini 
made the most of the opportunity 
and wristed a shot past Brady.

“Matt and Kent really have 

some chemistry, and Jack does 
with the line too, but those two 
guys seem to have some special 
chemistry 
with 
each 
other,” 

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
said. “But I like how they play. 
They’re good with the puck, but 
I really like how hard and what 
they’re doing and how smart 
they’re playing without the puck.”

The Wolverines spent little 

time in their defensive zone. The 
only time Arizona State sustained 
possession in its offensive zone 

was following Johnson’s goal. The 
Sun Devils challenged Mann with 
two shots while the Wolverines’ 
defensemen could not get the 
puck out of the zone, until junior 
defenseman Nick Blankenburg 
took a hooking penalty.

But on the ensuing power play, 

Arizona State failed to attempt a 
shot. The Sun Devils constantly 
turned the puck over, spending 
nearly no time in the offensive 
zone until too many men on the 
ice penalty negated the final 
minute of their power play.

“My team in front of me played 

really well, blocked shots,” Mann 
said. “Especially today, you could 
see that at the end.”

With Blankenburg’s penalty 

about to expire, Arizona State 
defenseman Jacob Wilson laid a 
big hit into sophomore forward 
Johnny Beecher, sending Beecher 

to the locker room. Beecher did 
not return, and while Pearson said 
he seemed fine after the game, his 
injury status is unknown. 

Wilson 
was 
called 
for 

a 
charging 
penalty, 
giving 

Michigan a five-on-three and a 
golden opportunity to extend its 
lead to two, but Brady came up 
with big save after big save for the 
Sun Devils. He robbed Beniers 
with a diving stop off a rebound 
and saved multiple one-timers 
from freshman forward Brendan 
Brisson from point-blank range. 

But despite not scoring on the 
power-play, the Wolverines had 
regained momentum and were in 
control the rest of the way. They 
outshot the Sun Devils 47-17 on 
the night.

Even though Michigan could 

not find the back of the net in the 
second period, it spent much of 
the frame on offense and outshot 
Arizona State 16-3 in the period. 
Johnson and Beniers led the 
way, regularly on the ice for long 
offensive zone shifts. It wasn’t 
until the third period that the 
Wolverines scored again, when 
junior forward Jimmy Lambert 
converted on a power-play to seal 
the game.

While the score didn’t reflect 

it, Michigan played nearly as 
dominant of a game on Sunday as 
it did on Saturday, with its highly-
touted freshmen leading the way.

An emphatic scream echoed 

throughout the mostly-empty 
Yost Ice Arena. 

Kent Johnson had glided into 

the offensive zone, picked up a 
rebound that floated into the 
slot and fired a puck into the 
back of the net. 

Before the goalie could even 

react, the freshman forward 
was already heading to the 
corner, cheering in jubilation 
with his hands in the air.

“It 
was 
just 
pure 
joy,” 

Johnson said. “It was just so 
much fun to play with the guys.”

Johnson’s first career goal 

capped off a memorable debut 
weekend for the winger. After 
totaling four assists in the 
season opener on Saturday 
— where Michigan blew out 
Arizona State 8-1 — Johnson’s 
goal set the tone early as the 
Wolverines 
captured 
their 

second win of the season, 3-0. 

Michigan looked like the 

stronger, 
faster 
team 
all 

weekend, and Johnson was 
emblematic of that on Sunday. 
He was flying around the ice 
displaying flashy dangles, and 
was a constant scoring threat. 

“Kent’s a hockey player, he’s 

a rink rat,” Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson said. “He enjoys being 
at the rink and works on his 
game a lot. He’s got very good 
hands and a high hockey IQ.”

The 
instant 
offensive 

explosion should come as no 
surprise. Johnson tallied 41 
goals and 60 assists last year in 
the British Columbia Hockey 
League — the most in the league 
by a wide margin. 

For 
most 
freshmen, 
the 

transition from juniors to the 
college level can be difficult. 
Even the most talented players 
can face some growing pains as 
they adjust to the physicality 
and speed of the college game. 
But Johnson already looks a 
step ahead of his competition. 
As a projected top ten pick in 
next year’s NHL draft, he’s 
starting to prove that the hype 
is real. 

“Obviously 
everything 

happens faster, and I won’t 
have as many scoring chances 
as I did last year,” Johnson said. 
“But I feel like I can just play my 
game, and it’s really fun.”

Johnson was also expected 

to be a boost to the Wolverines’ 
power play unit, which was 
middle-of-the-pack last season. 
He didn’t record any power 
play points on the weekend, 
but 
featured 
prominently 

throughout 
Michigan’s 
six 

man-advantage opportunities. 

Playing at left wing, Johnson 

spent most of the game on a 
line with another well-touted 
freshman: Matthew Beniers. 
The duo worked in lockstep 
and generated several scoring 
opportunities 
throughout 

the game. At one moment in 
the second period, Johnson 
corralled the puck behind the 
net and threw a behind the 
back pass to Beniers, who was 
sitting in front. Beniers’ shot 
was eventually blocked, but the 
play showed the potential those 
two have to be a special pairing 
all season. 

“I think we’ve got some 

great chemistry,” Johnson said. 
“Definitely really nice to play 
with him.”

Added 
Pearson: 
“They 

complement each other well. 
You got some size, you got some 
skill, you have some speed. 
Everything you’re looking for 
on a line.”

The Wolverines now turn 

their attention to Thursday’s 
matchup 
with 
Wisconsin. 

Johnson will hope to be a big 
part of the offense and find his 
way into the stat sheet again. 

“He’s a fun player, fun to 

watch,” Pearson said. “Probably 
not fun to play against.”

In lopsided loss, Michigan falls flat on 

its face

Two weeks ago, the Michigan 

football team reached its lowest 
point at the Big House in Jim 
Harbaugh’s six-year tenure with a 
shocking loss to three-touchdown 
underdog Michigan State.

It stooped even lower on 

Saturday night, this time to the 
tune of a 94-year record. For 
that, it has only its own lack of 
execution to blame.

The Wolverines were chased off 

their own field from the opening 
kickoff. By the end of the second 
quarter, Michigan trailed No. 
13 Wisconsin, 28-0 — its largest 
halftime deficit in the history of 
Michigan Stadium, which opened 
in 1927. It only got worse as the 
night went on, resulting in a 49-11 
loss.

For much of the first half, 

Harbaugh stood on the sideline, 
bent over, hands on his hips. It 
was a far cry from the coach who 
triumphantly returned to Ann 
Arbor in 2015 and wore his heart 
on his sleeve.

On 
the 
field, 
his 
players 

appeared to do the same. The 
Wolverines gained a mere one 
yard of total offense in the first 
quarter, and junior quarterback 
Joe Milton didn’t even complete 
a pass to his own team until the 
Badgers led 28-0. Things weren’t 
much better on the defensive side 
of the ball, as Wisconsin strolled 
into the end zone with little 
resistance on multiple occasions.

Asked to put his finger on 

where things went sideways, fifth-
year senior captain Carlo Kemp 
shrugged.

“Things just happened,” Kemp 

said. “Things played out like that.”

Added Harbaugh: “We were 

thoroughly beaten in every phase. 
Didn’t really do anything well. 
And did not play good, did not 
coach good. Not in a good place 
with the execution, not in a good 
place adjusting and what we were 
doing schematically. So not a good 
place as a football team right now 
and that falls on me.”

The words echoed Harbaugh’s 

sentiment following last year’s trip 
to Madison. After getting blown 
out 35-14, he proclaimed Michigan 
was “outcoached and outplayed.” 
The same words applied on 
Saturday night.

The storyline leading up to 

this game was whether or not 
Badgers’ 
quarterback 
Graham 

Mertz would play after his 
recent bout with COVID-19. As it 
turns out, that barely mattered. 
Michigan seemingly folded in 
the first quarter, and by the end 
of the night, its body language 
spoke louder than the lopsided 
scoreboard.

Playing for pride in the second 

half, the Wolverines tarnished 
their only spark — a four-play 
touchdown drive led by backup 
quarterback Cade McNamara — 
with a running into the kicker 
penalty on fourth-and-five. The 
ensuing dejection was apparent.

With heads hanging low, the 

Wolverines finished the fourth 
quarter with zero yards of total 
offense. By contrast, their porous 

defense surrendered 163 in a 
lifeless garbage time showing. 
Understandably, the results left 
Harbaugh floored.

“All things, thoroughly, (are) 

not where they need to be in 
terms of execution,” Harbaugh 
said. “So that starts with, as I said, 
starts with me, starts with our 
coaches, and also every person 
here. Understand what we’re 
supposed to do and then going and 
executing it.

“If somebody’s not executing 

it, then why is that? Are we 
communicating, are we coaching 
it well enough? There’s nothing 
right now to say that an acceptable 
job is being done right now. Players 
or coaches.”

Following 
Saturday 
night’s 

embarrassment, Michigan is 1-3 
for the first time since 1967. More 
specifically, it is 1-3 in Big Ten 
play for the first time since 2014. 
Harbaugh’s predecessor, Brady 
Hoke, was fired after that season.

The 
next 
month 
could 

determine 
whether 
or 
not 

Harbaugh endures the same 
fate. He has the back half of a 
pandemic-shortened season to fix 
things, and at this point, it seems 
the best place to start is in his own 
players’ heads.

“Right now, my concern level’s 

nowhere near worried or nervous 
or anything,” Kemp said. “… Am 
I worried? No. We’ve shown in 
the last three weeks, even though 
what the outcome has not been 
what we wanted at all, we’re still 
here.”

Michigan is quickly learning 

that showing up isn’t enough.

A dejected Michigan team showed little fight in Saturday night’s 49-11 loss to No. 13 Wisconsin.

Michigan’s road to this point started in 2017

Injuries aren’t an excuse, they’re an 

indictment

Three weeks before the Big 

Ten’s season began, Wisconsin lost 
its starting quarterback.

With all that’s happened since, 

it’s easy to forget. But Jack Coan, a 
steady if unspectacular starter for 
the Badgers in 2019, injured his foot 
in practice and was declared out 
indefinitely. His replacement was 
sophomore Graham Mertz, a four-
star recruit. In Wisconsin’s first 
game, he lit up Illinois, completing 
all but one of his passes.

After that game, the Badgers 

took another hit — a COVID-19 
outbreak that infected 12 players 
and 10 staffers, including Mertz, 
his 
backup 
and 
coach 
Paul 

Chryst. While Mertz was back 
for Saturday’s game, several other 
starters had yet to be cleared, 
including 
cornerback 
Rachad 

Wildgoose, running back Garrett 
Groshek and defensive end Garrett 
Rand.

Watching 
Wisconsin 
play 

against Michigan, you couldn’t tell.

The final score was 49-11, a 

beatdown in every sense of the 
word. Wisconsin was better at 
every position (except punter).

Most notably, what both teams 

put on the field was a depleted 
version of their normal selves. The 
Badgers could make sure that didn’t 
derail the game. The same couldn’t 
be said of Michigan.

The Wolverines took the field 

without both their starting tackles 
(Ryan Hayes and Jalen Mayfield) 
and both their starting defensive 
ends (Kwity Paye and Aidan 
Hutchinson, the latter of whom is 
out for the season) due to injuries. 
Boy, was it obvious.

“There’s guys that, they came 

to Michigan cause they wanted 
to play,” Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh said Monday. “Some are 
playing earlier than they thought 
they would, and there’s been some 
good play. Those are some of the 
areas ... to build upon.”

In other words, the replacements 

need improvement.

Without 
its 
anchors, 
the 

offensive line struggled to open up 
holes for the running game. The 
Wolverines gained just 47 yards on 
the ground. 

On defense, the effect was 

equally catastrophic. Michigan as a 
whole has struggled to get pressure 

on the quarterback all season, but at 
least Paye was everywhere on the 
field.

Fifth-year senior Carlo Kemp 

(normally a defensive tackle) and 
junior Taylor Upshaw handled the 
primary duties at defensive end. 
They combined for seven tackles, 
one tackle for loss and one sack. 
As a comparison, Paye finished 
with five tackles, a tackle for loss 
and a quarterback hurry against 
Indiana — a game he left early with 
an injury.

“There’s a lot of room for 

improvement,” Upshaw said last 
Monday. “Obviously when you 
have Aidan and Kwity, two guys 
you really rely on, go down, it’s 
gonna affect the game, but I have 

confidence in the backups and 
even the guys behind me so it’s 
just gonna have to be one of those 
things where you have to step up.”

While Michigan’s issues go 

beyond the injuries, it’s clear that 
the loss of Hayes, Paye, Hutchinson 
and Mayfield is really hurting it. 
That’s not to say it’s an excuse. 
Losing three of the best players on 
your team all at the same time is bad 
luck, but the way the Wolverines 
have played without them is an 
indictment of their depth.

Back in 2018, Michigan had 

Rashan Gary and Chase Winovich 
at defensive end, both of whom are 
in the NFL now. Both struggled 
with injuries at times that season, 
but the Wolverines had Hutchinson 
and Paye behind them to step in. 
On the offensive line, players like 
fifth-year senior Andrew Vastardis, 
senior Chuck Filiaga and Hayes 
backed up stalwarts like Jon 
Runyan, Ben Bredeson and Cesar 
Ruiz as recently as last year. This 
year, they’ve had to give starts to 
true freshman Zak Zinter.

On Saturday, Wisconsin had four 

different players garner at least 50 

rushing yards, and that was without 
Groshek — its leading rusher 
against the Illini. The Badgers’ top 
rusher Saturday was Jalen Berger, 
a true freshman playing in his first 
college game ever. He had 87 yards. 
John Chenal, a fullback with three 
career starts, had 71 yards. Danny 
Davis, normally a backup wide 
receiver, had 65.

“If you’re not embarrassed 

with those numbers, then you 
shouldn’t be part of this fricking 
game,” defensive line coach Shaun 
Nua said on the Inside Michigan 
Football 
radio 
show 
Monday 

night. “I can’t sleep, can’t eat. It’s 
just unacceptable. ... That is not 
Michigan football.”

But right now, it is Michigan 

football. With the kind of depth 
the Badgers have, and the kind the 
Wolverines don’t, they barely had a 
chance.

If Paye, Hayes and Mayfield are 

able to return soon, the Wolverines 
will get a boost. But that boost will 
mean little for a team that’s already 
1-3. 

Wisconsin is a shining example 

of a team that has depth and knows 
how to use it, the exact sort of team 
equipped to do well in the COVID-
19 era. Michigan used to be that 
kind of team, too, but now, it’s the 
sort of team that throws things 
at the wall and prays something 
sticks.

That’s not an excuse, it’s reality. 

It’s an indictment of coaching, 
development, recruiting, retention, 
all things a top Big Ten football 
team has to have.

One 
thing 
is 
clear: 
The 

Wolverines are no longer a top Big 
Ten football team.

Defensive end Taylor Upshaw tried to make up for key absences on Saturday.

T

alk to people from 
Jim Harbaugh’s 
first Michigan 
team, and you’ll 

hear stories about a man that no 
longer seems 
to exist.

There’s 

the four-hour 
practices 
and the 
submarine. 
There’s that 
time he got 
stopped at 
the door of 
the Mormon 
Tabernacle 
Church in Utah for wearing 
cleats, and that time he gave a 
speech from Shakespeare before 
the Ohio State game. You’ll 
hear how he got so involved in 
drills that he pulled a hamstring 
at practice, and staffers who 
followed him from Stanford will 
tell you about how he ran them 
off the racquetball court.

It’s a picture of intensity, focus 

and competitiveness — and a 
man who enjoys it all. It’s also a 
picture that could sell to recruits.

Because back then, back when 

everyone assumed hype would 
crystallize into reality, Jim 
Harbaugh recruited like he was 
running a program that could 
compete with the Ohio States 
of the world. His 2016 class 
featured the No. 1 player in the 
country, Rashan Gary, a current 
NFL star in Devin Bush Jr., and 
contributors up and down the 
board. 

Ben Bredeson became a 

captain. Mike Onwenu, Khaleke 
Hudson, Sean McKeon and 
Josh Metellus were multi-year 
starters. Lavert Hill and David 

Long were stalwart corners. 
Carlo Kemp, Chris Evans and 
Nick Eubanks are three of the 
team’s best players now.

On signing day, Harbaugh 

held an event at Hill Auditorium 
that featured Derek Jeter, Tom 
Brady, Ric Flair, Todd McShay, 
Lou Holtz, Mike Shanahan 
and a veritable stable of other 
celebrities. Then a year later, he 
signed a class that ranked even 
higher, according to 247Sports.

Never has that felt further 

away than Saturday night, when 
Harbaugh got to his Zoom press 
conference after a blowout 49-11 
loss to Wisconsin and was out of 
positive things to say about his 
team.

“We were thoroughly beaten 

in every phase,” Harbaugh said. 
“Didn’t really do anything well. 
And did not play good, did not 
coach good. 

“Not in a good place with the 

execution, not in a good place 
adjusting and what we were 
doing schematically. So not a 
good place as a football team 
right now and that falls on me.”

The bricks on Michigan’s road 

to a 1-3 record — to a perpetual 
bottom that keeps falling out — 
were laid in that 2017 recruiting 
class. The stars from that group, 
for the most part, are either gone, 
or have failed to live up to their 
potential, or both. And, after a 
disappointing 8-5 2017 season, 
the hype that fueled Harbaugh’s 
recruiting fizzled out. 

Michigan went from fifth to 

22nd in the recruiting rankings, 
per 247Sports’ composite score. 
The Wolverines didn’t take a 
defensive tackle in 2018 and took 
just three defensive ends. Lo 
and behold, on Saturday, with 
both their starting ends out with 

injury, Wisconsin made a living 
off running jet sweeps and end-
arounds.

“We didn’t set an edge all 

night in that,” Harbaugh said. 
“And as I said, there’s things that 
we weren’t containing.”

That cornerback group that 

struggled in perpetuity against 
Michigan State and Indiana? The 
highest-rated recruit Harbaugh 
managed to get at the position in 
2018 was Myles Sims. He plays 
for Georgia Tech now. The two 
four-stars Harbaugh got in 2017 
— Ambry Thomas and Benjamin 
St-Juste — aren’t with the 
program anymore.

As much as the misery of 

Michigan football in 2020 comes 
down to failures in coaching, 
execution and togetherness right 
now, this wasn’t especially hard 
to see coming. If you don’t recruit 
at a high level — and if you don’t 

recruit depth — you’re going to 
struggle. Simple as that.

And if the high-level talent you 

do recruit either leaves or fails to 
pan out (Aubrey Solomon, Drew 
Singleton and Luiji Vilain were 
three top-100 recruits in 2017, to 
name a few), it’ll get even worse. 
Not every recruit will pan out. 
But this isn’t good enough.

The average upperclassman 

the Wolverines started on 
offense Saturday had a .8782 
composite score on 247Sports 
— firmly in three-star range. 
On defense, it was .8923 — just 
barely above the four-star 
threshold.

Want to find where this 

program’s struggles start? It’s 
right there. You can trace a line 
straight through to the late 
hours of Saturday night, when 
Harbaugh sat in front of a Zoom 
camera and said, “Every part is 

not close to where it should be.”

Some of that is out of 

Harbaugh’s control. The 
pandemic hastened departures 
for Thomas and receiver Nico 
Collins. Starting tackles Jalen 
Mayfield and Ryan Hayes, and 
starting defensive ends Kwity 
Paye and Aidan Hutchinson, 
missed Saturday’s game with 
injuries. But the lack of ability 
to withstand such losses falls on 
Harbaugh’s shoulders.

So, too, for that matter, does 

the bad body language — hung 
heads and sullen looks — and 
failure to react to adversity and 
the complete, utter mess we’ve 
seen for the last three weeks. 
All of that is on Jim Harbaugh, 
and $8 million a year should buy 
Michigan more than this.

Here’s a challenge: Name 

three good things about the 
Michigan football team right 
now.

There’s Ronnie Bell, who 

continues to defy any reasonable 
expectation. Then there’s … well, 
punter Brad Robbins seems to be 
doing a good job.

Five days earlier, Harbaugh 

bristled when a reporter asked 
about his lack of a contract 
extension, and whether he wants 
to be at Michigan over the long 
term. Those questions will keep 
coming now, in waves. But if 
Michigan keeps playing like this, 
the question can’t be whether he 
wants to be at Michigan over the 
long term. 

It needs to be whether 

Michigan wants him.
