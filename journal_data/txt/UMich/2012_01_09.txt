* UNIVERSITY HOUSING
Ciao Down
temporarily
closes due to
* cockroaches

'U' Housing
spokesman: "We
have it under
control."
By ANNA ROZENBERG
Daily Staff Reporters
Apparently students aren't the
only ones chowing down at South
Quad.
Ciao Down Pizzeria, the cafe
located in South Quadrangle
Residence Hall, was temporarily
closed starting on Dec.15 due to a
cockroach infestation, University
Housing spokesman Peter Logan
confirmed in an interview Friday.
Logan said University Housing
and the University's Department
of Occupational Safety and Envi-
ronmental Health agreed to close
the cafe upon making the discov-
ery, in order to begin aggressive
treatments while student were
gone for break to take advantage
of "low student activity."
"There was some roach activ-
ity we felt we needed to address
immediately," Logan said.
Since the roaches infested a
food preparation area, Logan said
exterminators took extra precau-

tions during extermination.
"The treatments we use are all
food safe in food areas," Logan
said.
Logan said that while Ciao
Down has reopened, the Uni-
versity will continue to take
necessary steps to alleviate the
situation if needed, adding that
ultimately the cafe could close
for good if it becomes a serious
issue.
"We're confident right now
we have it under control," Logan
said.
Shortly after the closure, a
YouTube videosurfaced showing
signs of the cockroach infestation
in the eatery. In the video, the
narrators claim they aren't going
out of their way to look for cock-
roaches, yet stumble upon more
than five of the pests in the first
few minutes of filming.
The description of the video,
posted on Dec. 17 by a student-
employee who wishes to remain
anonymous, alleges thatthe video
was taken the day after extermi-

present in the film.

U.S. Department of
Energy funds new
transporation
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
As part of University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman's
initiative to develop a more sus-
tainable future, the University
recently purchased four hybrid
buses and 30 hybrid sedans for

student transportation.
Keith Johnson, associate
director of transportation oper-
ations at the University, said the
hybrid vehicles are part of the
University's ongoing push for
more environmentally friendly
practices.
"it has been a plan to do more
sustainability operations-wise
and this (purchase) fits right
into it," Johnson said.
The University plans to pur-
chase an additional three hybrid
buses with a grant provided by

the U.S. Department of Energy
through the Michigan Green
Fleets program - a $40 million
project that works toward pro-
viding alternative fuel sources
and technology for transporta-
tion in the state. The grant cov-
ers the $168,000 difference
between the cost of a conven-
tional bus and a hybrid bus,
Johnson said.
The hybrid buses feature a
rooftop-mounted battery, which
is charged by energy converted
from when the bus brakes. The

battery supplements a diesel
engine, making the hybrid buses
30 percent more efficient than
conventional buses, according to
a Jan. S University press release.
Though only one bus is cur-
rently operational, more will
become active throughout the
year, Johnson said, adding there
are plans to replace all Univer-
sity buses in the future. The new
buses complement the 545 Uni-
versity owned vehicles currently
running on an environmentally

A SWEET NEW YEAR

Non-unionized salaries

Professors, 'U' staff
receive slight raise
from last year
By PAIGE PEARCY
Daily News Editor
Another year and another pay
raise for certain faculty members
at the University.
Non-unionized faculty mem-
bers received an average salary

increase of 2.8 percent in 2011,
a slight increase from the previ-
ous year's average increase of 2.6
percent.
When University President
Coleman assumed her position
in 2002, she made it a priority to
institute a modest salary increase
for faculty members each year,
Martha Pollack, the University's
vice provost for academic and
budgetary affairs, said.
In a testimony Coleman made
before the House and Senate

Higher Education Appropriation
subcommittees last March, she
said salary increases are impor-
tant to retain faculty.
"The last thing we want is to
lose talented people," Coleman
said in her testimony. "We have
already seen too many leave
our state. And so we are very
thoughtful about salaries and
rewarding people."

FROM THE EDITOR
An apology and explanation

ACTIVE CELEBRATION

Truthfulness is the central tenet of
everythingwe do at The Michigan Daily.
By producing content in the Daily that
is accurate and original, you, our read-
ers, can be assured that the information
you're reading is trustworthy.
A column in the Nov. 17, 2011 edition
of The Michigan Daily, written by a for-
mer Daily columnist, didn't meet this
standard.
The column was inspired by a piece
written by David Brooks of The New
York Times (The Life Reports, 10/27/11).
Though Brooks's columnwas mentioned
in the Daily article, the columnist used
many of the same words and phrases as
Brooks without proper attribution. The
first few paragraphs of the Daily's col-
umn were also structured nearly identi-
cally to Brooks's.
This was an institutional failing. We,
as editors, never should have let this
column go to print, and for that, we are
deeply sorry.
After a thorough investigation of the
CRIME NOTES

columnist's prior work for the Daily, this
was the only incident we identified. Still,
we take all cases of plagiarism seriously
as they violate the truthfulness that the
Daily stands for.
We will use this as an opportunity
to improve our internal safeguards to
certify the originality of all content we
publish. We've already added enhanced
plagiarism checks to our normal editing
process, and we're planning to revamp
our training program to better teach our
staff what is considered plagiarism.
We hope that these steps will help us
maintain your trust, because as the only
daily newspaper in Ann Arbor, there's
nothing we value more than that.

It will employ around 15 people,
including some recruited locally

Asian duck draws
bird enthusiasts to
California
A rare duck normally only seen
in Asia has somehow turned up in
California, drawing excited bird
watchers from all over the U.S.
and Canada to a wildlife refuge in
the state's Central Valley.
Wildlife officials say a male
falcated duck, a bird common in
China, was first spotted at the ref-
uge on Dec. 8.
Since then, thousands of bird-
ers have observed it paddling
among mallards, pintails and
geese, said Lora Haller, who
works at the Colusa Wildlife Ref-
uge's visitor center. More than
2,000 cars packed with visitors
have streamed into the refuge
over the last month - double the
usual visitor numbers.
"It's very exciting," she said.
"It's extremely rare to see this
kind of duck in California."

Giffords plans her

One year after

WASHINGTON (AP) - The
signals are strong. One year
after being shot in the head,
Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is on a
mission to return to the job she
so clearly loved.
Her husband and people
near the three-term congress-
woman say she is highly moti-
vated to recover from her
injuries and get back to work in
Washington, potentially using
her inspirational story as away
to mend political differences in
the nation's capital. She faces
a May deadline to get on the
November ballot, meaning she
has a few months to decide her
next step.
Her future will depend on a
recovery that has progressed

in remarkable fashion over the
past year as she is now able to
walk and talk. Her only inter-
view occurred with ABC's
Diane Sawyer nearly10 months
after the shooting and showed
how far she has come, but also
how far she has to go. At the
time, she did not speak in com-
plete sentences and repeated
her words to make her point.
"No, better. Um, better, bet-
ter," she said when asked about
returning to Washington.
The day after the interview
ran, her congressional office
released an audio recording
that showed she had made
progress in her communica-
tion skills in the two weeks
that had elapsed between
the interview and its airing.
She read from a script and an
aide said it took multiple tries
before she was comfortable
with the result.

One of Israel's most popular
television personalities quit the
news business yesterday to start
his own political party, a move
that could shake up the Israeli
political system by energizing
opposition to Prime Minister Ben-
jamin Netanyahu.
Yair Lapid is a best-selling
author and columnist who has
anchored Channel 2's top-rated
weekend news edition for the past
four years. Polls show the 48-year-
old Lapid would do well, particu-
larly with secular voters.
A poll conducted late last week
a by Israel Radio said a Lapid-led
party could win as many as 15
seats in the 120-seat parliament
if elections were held now. That
could make it the second-largest
party after Prime Minister Benja-
min Netanyahu's Likud.
Elections in Israel are set for
late 2013, but in Israel's parlia-
mentary system, governments
rarely serve their full terms, and
analysts believe elections could
take place as early as this year.

Raising worry
'U' spending must align with student interests
With tuition increasing every year, students are under-
standably concerned about how their contribution to the
University's revenue is spent. A portion of the funds go
to yearly salary raises received by University employees. Spending
should follow inflation rates and provide the best resources for stu-
dents. Salary increases were improved to attract and retain professors
and administrators. While sometimes necessary and earned, salary
increases and bidding wars over highly paid professors and executive
officers result in tuition increases. Salary increases that students pay
for should be used to provide direct benefits and a better education
for the students.

FROM THE PUBLIC EDITOR I
Free speech restricted

n October of last year, an
e-mail went out to the staff of
The Michigan Daily with the
subject line of: "Important message
about petitions and causes.' That
e-mail drew my attention. I saved it,
and an excerpt (including original
emphasis) follows: "If you are on
staff or are in the process of becom-
ing a staff member, you CANNOT
sign any petitions or post links to
petitions on your Facebook wall.
This also applies to expressing your
opinion about issues on campus.
For example, you cannot publicly
state your opinion about controver-
sial topics like the pro-life exhibit
on the Diag."
The e-mail reflected a policy that
I've seen slowly crystallizing at this
newspaper for everal years now
- one that Iv never really been
comfortable with. In previous (and
more benign) forms, the policy was
difficult to contest. But as it stands
in the final form expressed in that
e-mail, that policy is clearly wrong,
and can't be the actual rule.
The Daily simply can't ban staff-
ers from "publicly expressing [their]
opinions about controversial top-
ics." To do so would be a grave viola-
tion of this paper's own free speech
ideals, and may even violate actual
legal standards pertaining to free
speech.
Upon digging into the Daily's
bylaws, I am happy to report that
the strict policy expressed in that
email is actually not the Daily's
official rule. I write this column to
clarify the true rule that the Daily's
bylaws have established to negotiate
the line between journalistic ethics
and personal freedom of speech. It's
important that the Daily's current
leaders pay close attention to the
relevant parts of the Daily's bylaws

and stop enforcing the erroneous,
overbroad policy expressed in that
e-mail.
The entirety of this issue is actu-
ally governed by just one segment of
the Daily's bylaws - Section III.2.A
of the Code of Ethics. The relevant
excerpt of that section follows:
"The Daily's beat reporters
should not reveal their bias about
their beats ... Similarly, general
assignment reporters and photog-
raphers may not reveal their biases
about stories they are covering.
Editors may not reveal their bias
about any story or issue they may
assign or rewrite. News reporters
and editors may not reveal person-
al opinions in the Daily that dam-
age the news section's reputation
of objectivity. Daily staff members
who are not covering a specific
beat, issue, or event may reveal
their biases, but not as a represen-
tative of the Daily. Any Daily staff-
ers who have identified themselves
as representatives of other organi-
zations at public events should not
simultaneously or subsequently
identify themselves as Daily staff-
ers in that context."
So, that section prohibits beat
reporters from expressing their
personal opinions about their
beats, and it also prohibits "general
assignment reporters and photog-
raphers" from revealing their bias-
es about stories they are covering.
That's fair enough, and completely
necessary to maintain objectivity
of the news section. It also takes
further steps to limit Daily staffers
from expressing opinions on issues
that they may be involved with in
their official capacity at the Daily.
But you'll notice that at every
step, the Code of Ethics hedges
and qualifies the restrictions -

before ultimately stating that Daily
staffers are generally allowed to
express their opinions as long as
they don't do so as representatives
of the Daily. The nuance in that
rule is crucial to maintaining the
proper balance between journalis-
tic integrity and personal freedom
of speech of Daily staffers. That
nuance should not be lost.
Without digging too far into
the law pertaining to free speech
(because I don't think this issue
should even come to that), I brief-
ly summarize to underscore the
seriousness of the issue. The U.S.
Supreme Court has held that pub-
lic employees do not lose their free
speech rights as a result of their
employment. There are many fac-
tors to consider, but broad restric-
tions on expressing any opinions
publicly almost always fail the test.
And while Daily staffers may not
see themselves as public employ-
ees, their checks come from a pub-
lic University, and the body of law
applying to other public employees
will likely apply here.
Potential legal violations aside,
the Daily has a strong core belief in
a broad application of the concept
of free speech. It's important that
those in charge of the paper apply
those ideals to the free speech
rights of their staffers outside of
the Daily. The Daily's bylaws strike
an important balance on this front,
and it can't be ignored.

Compared to previous years, faculty and
staff received below-average salary increas-
es. Faculty received a 2.8 percent increase
while staff received a 2.2 percent increase.
This year's changes are less than the average
salary increases over the past five years - 3.7
percent for faculty and 2.5 percent for staff.
The executive officers received a 2.7 percent
salary increase, higher than the five-year
average of 2.5 percent.
Salary increases are necessary to retain
the best faculty and staff. Instructors of all
skill levels should get salary increases to
keep pace with inflation. Snyder's 2012 fis-
cal year budget brought about drastic cuts to
state funding for the University. Asa result, a
larger portion of salary increases must come
from tuition raises.
Students should not pay for large sal-
-y raises for teachers who don't necessarily
haoe a large impact on them. Top universities
engage in bidding wars to attract talented
faculty, but oftentimes professors' other
University endeavors, like research projects,
have little personal impact on students. The

professors who interact with the most stu-
dents and have a positive impact on the cam-
pus community deserve to be rewarded for
their work.
The highest salary increase was given to
executives who declined a salary increase
in 2009. While their positions are obviously
important, these officials rarely interact
with students. University President Mary
Sue Coleman recently sent a letter to Presi-
dent Barack Obama advocating for afford-
able higher education. The executives' raise
contradicts Coleman's public declaration
that the University is working toward more
affordable higher education. The executive
officers should once again skip their salary
increase if they are advocating for affordable
education, even if the denial of the raise is
simply a symbolic gesture.
Obviously, salary increases are part of a
normal, yearly procedure. But as tuition costs
and the decline of state funding make higher
education less accessible, the University must
ensure that all types of spending increases
are vital and in students' best interests.

Institutionalizing ignorance

NIRBHAY JAIN I
Why the world should end

We've all heard the news. The Mayan calen-
dar predicts the world will end on Dec. 21 - a
mere 11 months and 12 days from now. There's
no scientific proof. There's no mythological
proof. Hell, even Mayan scholars disclaim the
theory that the calendar ends. They claim that
just the current cycle ends. No matter. The year
2012has become such a phenomenon that there
was a movie with John Cusack in it (Note - not
at all worth watching). Most people are scared
about the world ending. They don't wantto die.
There are things they want to do, people they
want to see and places they want to visit. I, for
one, am excited at the prospect of the world
ending. I believe a lot of good will come of it.
Besides, there are legitimate reasons as to why
the world should end this December.
1. It's the only way to stop the SEC from win-
ning more Bowl Championship Series titles,
and it stops the BCS controversy.
2. Oil reserves are out? Who cares? Nobody
is driving anymore anyway.
3. Global warming? There willbe no globe to
warm. Pollution? No big deal. Whatever pollu-
tion goes into space will be of no consequence.
4. All the health issues in the world will be
gone. Especially obesity. Pizza as a vegetable
didn't help stop the world from ending. Noth-
ing will. So you might as well forgetaboutexer-
cise and eat whatever the hell you want. Who
cares aboutchaving a heart attack at 22? At least
you went out on your own terms.
5. Genocide and racism? We're all equal
when we're all dead.
6. The new Hobbit movie that's coming out
won't have a chance to disappoint. Though it
probably won't anyway.
7. The U.S. can finally pay off all its debt,
which would be $0.00.
8. All the species that are endangered and
need protection will be extinct anyway, as will
those species that aren't endangered.
9. Republicans and Democrats will finally
get along. Also, there will be no more politick-
ing. No more mudslinging. No more campaign-
ing. No more debates. No more TV ads. No
more anything when it comes to politics.
10. We will finally have found the cure for
cancer, HIV, HPV, herpes, gonorrhea, polio and
the common cold all at once. And it's the same
simple thing.
11. Gun control will be solved.
12. Abortion will no longer be an issue. All
those unborn babies will be dead anyway.
13. Nuclear reactors will all melt down. Just
like the anti-nuclear activists said.

14. We will finally have a storage place for all
those nuclear bombs.
15. The Cold War will finally be over. We'll
have put Russia in its place.
16. The conflict between Israel and the Pal-
estinians will be solved. Neither gets that land.
The aliens take it over and everybody loses.
That's fair, isn't it?
17. Justin. Bieber. Will. Be. Dead. And. There.
Will. Be. No. More. Twilight. How is that not a
good thing?
18. We'll all find out if there truly is a God.
Also, we'll see if thatwhole heaven thing is true
too.
19. Water will finally run out for all of us. Too
bad "all of us" might be a few people left.
20. Maybe zombies will finally come to life
and eat us all ... at least all those movies will be
true then.
21. A few lucky people might be able to visit
Mars, or Venus, or even Jupiter. That's assum-
ing Earth takes the moon with it.
22. No more tests. No more homework. No
more studying. Just an eternity of relaxation.
Think of it as an extra-long nap from which
you'll never wake up.
23. All those issues with capital punishment
will be moot. Those criminals that the liber-
als want to save will all be dead. Granted, the
innocent ones will be dead too, but that's just
a side effect.
24. Teams that won't be able to add one more
trophy: The Green Bay Packers, the Miami
Heat, the New York Yankees, the St. Louis
Cardinals, and the Detroit Red Wings. Play-
ers and coaches who won't be in our faces for
much longer: LeBron James, Roger Federer,
Michael Phelps, Tiger Woods, A-Rod, Derek
Jeter, Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, James Har-
rison, Michael Vick, Joe Paterno, Urban Meyer,
and Rich Rod.
25. Michigan Football will end its final regu-
lar season where it should. With an unblem-
ished record and a complete spanking of that
School Down South.
There you have it. Whythe world should end
this year. It's sad that there are more reasons
why it should end than why it shouldn't. We'll
always remember the good years, or the good
ol' years - which to most of us was when we
were told it was the good ol' years. So here's to
hoping that the world does end in 2012. I can't
stand the world as it is any longer. Something
needs to change.

ish, and Islamic

Maybe a bet- _
ter question is
this: Who here
enjoys the freedom to learn our his-
tory?
That, among other things, is a rea-
son to be proud of the University of
Michigan. Whether we identify with
specific cultural studies or simply
wish to deepen our appreciation for
them, all students here enjoy a safe
space in which to pursue our aca-
demic interests. That's something to
be thankful for, and why I'm so dis-
turbed by recent events in Arizona.
No, I'm not talking about the
state's dubious immigration law,
which by some interpretations pro-
motes racial profiling as a means to
identify illegal aliens.
I'm talking about Arizona's efforts
to institutionalize ignorance - to
curb access to key pieces of Ameri-
can history by outlawing the study
of minority oppression. That's right.
Arizona wants to gloss over anything
remotely shameful in our past.
Here's what's happening in the
strange land of Arizona.
In 2010, the Arizona state Leg-
islature passed a law prohibiting
school districts from having any
classes that encourage "the over-
throw of the United States govern-
ment," incite "resentment toward
a race or class of people," are
"designed primarily for pupils of
a particular ethnic group" and/or
"advocate ethnic solidarity."
Shortly after going into effect,
John Huppenthal, Arizona superin-
tendent of public instruction, ruled
that the Tucson Unified School Dis-
trict was in violation of the new law.
Why? Because TUSD, which is 61
percent Latino, offers its students
a program in Mexican American
studies. Huppenthal said he fears

that the curriculums "characterize
historical events in racial terms."
"Absolutely," he said in an inter-
view with National Public Radio.
"We have to study historical injus-
tice, but we need to do that within
the context of creating a better
society, not creating racial resent-
ment that leads students into an
attitude of getting even as opposed
to getting ahead."
Maybe that argument would
hold some weight if there were any
semblance of truth in it. Instead,
according to an independent audit
conducted by Cambium Learning
Group, Inc. in Jun. 2011, there was
no evidence that the Mexican Amer-
ican studies program is in violation
of the law. In fact, the courses may
be doing more good than they're
given credit for - reading and writ-
ing scores were up, the classes were
popular and effective and high
school seniors enrolled ina Mexican
American studies course, the report
stated, "are more likely to graduate
than their peers."
It's clear from looking at hard
facts - the Mexican American stud-
ies course is helping to close the
achievement gap that has plagued
the district for longer than most
would like to acknowledge.
But that's the funny thing about
Arizona - facts don't seem to mat-
ter. Less than two weeks ago, an
Arizona state judge, responding to
a TUSD appeal, sided with Huppen-
thal. In spite of Cambium's report,
the judge reaffirmed that the cours-
es in Mexican American studies vio-
late state law.
Now TUSD faces a choice. Unless
Tucson reforms or abolishes Mexi-
can American studies, it is within
the state's rights to withhold 10 per-
cent of the district's funding-about
$15 million per year.
So let me be frank, Arizona - this
is disgusting.
But perhaps equally disgusting
is the lack of attention this story
has received. All of this made some
waves, albeit small, in the national
media back in June 2010 when
Huppenthal first made the allega-
tions against TUSD.. Vet I've heard
next to nothing about it over the
last few weeks. Now, as Arizona
readies itself to deny a significant

portion of its students the right to
learn and the right to succeed, our
media and national leaders are con-
tent to stand idly by, watching care-
lessly as a blatant affront to justice
unfolds before them.
The events playing out in Tucson
are indicative of a broader worri-
some national trend - our inability
to question, criticize or condemn our
own nation's history. Why have we,
Americans, succumbed to a glori-
fied mythology wherein the United
States can do no wrong? Why have
we grown complacent in our concep-
tualization of the past?
Let me be frank,
Arizona - this is
disgusting.
I have no doubt that we live in
a great country, but let's also not
deceive ourselves.
Our deified Founding Fathers
were slave-owners. Our forebears
exterminated Native Americans.
The United States has ignored fla-
grant human rights abuses, and our
government has supported dictator-
ships. For all its progress, the United
States is not yet a society of perfect
equal opportunity. And yes, Mexican
Americans have indeed been victims
of discrimination and exploitation.
Like every individual, and like
every nation, we have skeletons in
our closet. Don't try to hide them
or pretend we're perfect. Sure, you
and I aren't responsible for what
happened hundreds of years ago
- slavery didn't occur under our
watch. But we do ourselves a dis-
service, and we become complicit
in those travesties, when we fail to
acknowledge the events that make
up our history and shape the world
in which we live today.
Don't put a stopper on historical
consciousness - in the classroom,
most of all.

road types, citing a revision made
to the original ordinance that
requires a vehicle to stop when
the pedestrian is on the half of
the roadway on which the vehicle
is traveling.
"On a typical neighborhood

and two lanes of traffic, it's abso-

he is pleased the University is
making a step toward increased
sustainability. However, he
doesn't believe funding for the
buses should come from the fed-
eral government.
"I think the University should
be putting up its own money,"
Gizicki said. "Every student pays
$20,000 in-state (tuition) and
$40,000 out-of-state (tuition).
Where does that money go?"
Gizicki also said he believes the
University should explore other
mass transportation options, like

a monorail.
Engineering graduate student
Parkin Furia said he was skep-
tical of how environmentally
friendly the buses really are.
"I don't know how much dif-
ference they will make," he said.

City Council member Tony
Derezinski (D-Ward 2) said
council must continue to protect
pedestrians in Ann Arbor and
seek new ways to ensure safety.
"We are there for a reason,"
Derezinski said. "We have an atti-
tude and a value of really promot-
ing pedestrian traffic and making
it safe."
LSA freshman Claire Erba
said she believes that the newly
passed ordinance is more realis-
tic and will benefit both pedestri-
ans and drivers.
"Pedestrians will now need to
clearly indicate their intention to

use the crosswalk by standing on
the curb," Erba said. "This will
definitely prevent drivers from
guessing whether or not someone
is about to cross the street and
will prevent rear-end collisions."
Kinesiology freshman Chel-
sea Morgan said though she was
unaware of the revisions, she
was confused when cars have
stopped long before she arrived at
a crosswalk. Regardless, Morgan
said she is not concerned for her
safety.
"I haven't noticed the effect of
the new law after I arrived back
on campus from home," Morgan
said. "But even without the revi-
sions, I felt safe as both a driver
and pedestrian in Ann Arbor."

Berkowitz said.
According to the city ordi-

is an ongoing issue.
"The employees that have
been here for years say there's
always been a huge cockroach
problem," the student said.
However, in an interview last
night, Logan said he is unaware
of cockroaches being a prob-
lem prior to last month, adding
that University Housing always
responds quickly to pest issues
when they're brought to its
attention.
"t don't know how much of
an issue they were before the
middle of December," Logan
said. "We routinely do preven-
tive treatment for pest in the
facilities and whenthere's some
indication there's increased
activity we'll do more aggres-
sive treatment.
The student who posted
the video said he doesn't think
University Housing will com-
pletely rid South Quad of the
cockroaches completely because
they haven't done so thus far.
"I don't eat the food there
anymore so it's up to whoever
sees the video to make their
own decisions," he said.

said he purchases food at Ciao

While it's still uncertain if
the Insomnia Cookies truck will
be able to sell cookies in the city
again, Berkowitz said the com-
pany is eager to rejoin the Ann
Arbor community if the opportu-
nity arises. He said he estimates
the company may even return as
early as August or September.
"It was great for us, we were
very happy being (in Ann Arbor)
and we look forward to being
back," he said.
Berkowitz added that the busi-
ness was extremely profitable
on State Street and leaving Ann
Arbor "was a very unfortunate
split."
In past years, the truck had
also parked in front of South
Quad Residence Hall on East
Madison Street, but Berkowitz
said the number of customers at
,the location was not comparable
to the business at'the company's w
regular State Street spot.
Though the truck did draw
business in front of South Quad, it
was only 25 percent of the profit
the company would have made on
State Street, Berkowitz said.

doesn't completely surprise me."
Brajer said he thinks the Uni-

dents in South Quad about the
cockroach problem.
"We have the right to know,
ultimately we're the ones paying
to keep them running," Brajer
said.
"They should let us know
what measures they took to fix
it, too," he added.
LSA senior Dia Bright-John-
son, an employee at Ciao Down,

Jim Seta, owner of Stucchi's
on State Street - a former ven-
dor of Insomnia Cookies prod-
ucts - said though his store is
not currently selling the cookies,
he believes they were popular
among students and would like to
sell them again.
"Right now, it's still up in the
air," Seta said.
Berkowitz said Insomnia
Cookies continues to thrive on
other major college campuses,
including Michigan State Uni-
versity. The shop in East Lansing
is located on East Grand River
Avenue, an area that Berkowitz
described as being very similar
to the State Street and South Uni-
versity areas.
LSA sophomore Patricia
Bynum said that Insomnia Cook-
ies's late hours deterred her from
shopping regularly at the truck,
but added she is understanding of
the frustration held by other stu-
dents who were frequent custom-
ers of the truck.
"I don't really see how it was

"Around that time (of night),

said she was not told the reason
why it had closed.
"I'm not surprised they didn't
tell anybody because they obvi-
ously would decrease business

said.
Bright-Johnson said know-
ing that cockroaches caused
the closing is unsettling. How-
ever, she added the University
wouldn't have reopened Ciao
Down if it were unsafe to eat
there.
"I would still eat here, things
happen," Bright-Johnson said.

SALARIES
From Page 1A
tially lower than the previous
five-year average salary increase
of 3.4 percent. For staff members,
the increase this year was an
average of 2.2 percent, also lower
than the five-year average of 2.5
percent.
Last year, the University's
executive officers received a sal-
ary increase of 2.7 percent, higher
than the average increase of 2.5
percent from 2005-2009. Pollack
noted that in 2009 the execu-
tive officers received no salary
increase, potentially skewing the
average.
Pollack added that though
salaries have increased, faculty
pay for more of their health care
benefits - a policy that was made
effective in 2003 and has saved*
the University $90 million a year
in reoccurring costs, and $400
million in cumulative costs.
The funds for salary hikes
come from each school and col-
lege's budget, Pollack said. She
added that the University allo-
cates money for pay raises from
its general fund budget for units
that don't generate their own rev-
enue.

As former dean of the School of
Information, Pollack said she was
once involved with deciding the
salary increases for the school,
and considered a wide array of
factors, including inflation and
retention rates.
"It's very different for faculty,
of course it's a national market
and for staff it's a regional mar-
ket, (so) we'd look at what cost of
living is, inflation, and we'd look
at what kind of funds we have
available," she added.
There are three ranks of
appointments for professors at
the University - assistant, asso-
ciate and full professor. When a
faculty member reaches a new
level, they receive a raise. With
only three raises possible over
the career of an average pro-
fessor, annual salary increases
serve as a modest reward for the
work faculty do, Pollack said.
In her testimony last year,
Coleman outlined the impor-
tance of merit-based salary
increases to keep the University
competitive.
"I am proud that we are able
to offer competitive salaries
throughout the University," she
said in her testimony. "I am not
going to punish people for doing
a good job. We want the best, and
work hard to keep them."

Pollack said that when sal-
ary increases are calculated, an
inflation rate of about 2 percent
is typically used, so if the total
increase is less than 2 percent it
serves as an effective decrease in
pay for faculty.
Pollack added that salary
increases are also calculated into
what students pay for tuition. In
June, the University Board of
Regents voted to increase tuition
by 6.7 percent, or, $797, for in-
state students and 4.9 percent, or
$1,781, for out-of-state students
for the current school year.
"If we had no salary increases,
tuition would be lower," Pollack
said.
Pollack said faculty salaries
at the University of Michigan
are lower than those at schools
such as Northwestern Univer-
sity, Harvard College and Yale
University. An annual increase
is implemented to keep faculty
salaries competitive, she said.
Specifically, University facul-
ty members saw a larger increase
than other Big Ten schools,
including Ohio State Univer-
sity, which increased its sal-
ary by 2 percent and Michigan
State University at 2.5 percent.
Harvard College also received
a maximum salary increase of 2
percent.

Foreign laughs in 'Boys'

"Great snakes! Beyonce named her baby what?"
A tl gnime

'Tintin' brings a
childhood classic
to 3-D life
By KAVI SHEKHAR PANDEY
Daily Arts Writer
One of the most egregious
lapses in our nation's culture (the
other being our disregard for the
metric system) is the obscurity of
Herg6's indel-
ible creations,*
Tintin and
Snowy. Every- The
where else in
the world, the AdvntureS
comic books of Tintin
chronicling the
escapades of At Quality16
the baby-faced and Rave
reporter are
a prescribed Paramount
dose for child-
hood, but in America, only a few
can distinguish Tintin from the
German shepherd with the simi-
lar moniker. Good thing one of
the few is Steven Spielberg, who
recognizedthe sensational thrills
and ingenious whims of Tintin's
tales and joined forces with Peter
Jackson ("District 9") to make a
motion-capture masterpiece in
"The Adventures of Tintin."
The film is a mash-up of some
of Hergd's finest stories, patching
together elements of "The Secret
of the Unicorn" and "The Crab
with the Golden Claws" to create
a new narrative. Like the comics,
it's an adventure in the purest
sense - sleek, swift and trimmed
of all flourishes that don't get the

pulse racing (no character devel-
opment, no problem). A jazzy,
giddy, "Catch Me If You Can"-
esque opening credit sequence
starts the festivities, and soon
Tintin (Jamie Bell, "Billy Elliot")
gets hot on the trail of a sunken
treasure.
As always, Tintin is joined by
his intrepid, exceptionally intelli-
gent canine Snowy, who saves his
arse on more than one occasion,
and is capable of taking on even
the fiercest of fellow mutts. The
bungling detective duo Thomp-
son (Simon Pegg, "Mission
Impossible: Ghost Protocol") and
Thomson (Nick Frost, "Attack the
Block") also get their moments
of hilarity - to be precise, they
are only hilarious momentari-
ly - leading a silly subplot that
eventually ties into the main nar-
rative.
But "Tintin" doesn't hit its
stride until the rambunctious,
persistently inebriated Captain
Haddock (Andy Serkis, "Rise of
the Planet of the Apes") stumbles
into the picture. Armed with a
bottle of Loch Lomond whiskey,
Serkis gives. a stupendous por-
trayal of Haddock, a pro-alcohol-
ism PSA that excels in pratfalls
and insults - billions of blue blis-
teringbarnacleshe's funny - but
when duty calls, he becomes the
bravest of them all.
From start to finish, "The
Adventures of Tintin" bursts
with Spielbergian zeal - the zeal
of incredible spectacle, of taking
cinema to daring newheights and
making audiences quiver with
amazement. It has been 50 years,
but Spielberg hasn't lost an ounce

of the vigor he had as akid mak-
ing movies with a Super 8 cam-
era - now, he just has new toys
to tinker with in motion capture
and 3-D technology.
"Tintin" first flashes its
razzle-dazzle during a flash-
back of pirate action with more
swashbuckling swagger than
the entire "Pirates" franchise,
redeeming the director against
all who claimed "Hook" fal-
tered. But it's a mere herald for
the galvanizing, mesmerizing
chase through Bagghar - a
nearly five-minute continuous
shot, with motorcycles, tanks
and Snowy fighting a falcon, that
stands among the hallowed halls
of cinema's greatest achieve-
ments. Computer-generated or
not, Spielberg has laid down
the gauntlet, slapping the entire
Directors Guild across the face
with a white glove and challeng-
ing them to top that. You just got
served, James Cameron.
Spielberg's drive to make
superlative cinema is as
unquenchable as Tintin's thirst
for adventure (and Haddock's
thirst for whiskey, for that mat-
ter). And this film isn't just about
the stunning set pieces - Spiel-
berg's love for the material pours
through in the most minute of
details, from newspaper head-
lines to Snowy's ancillary inter-
actions with his surroundings.
Critics have complained that the
Almighty Bearded One has lost
his wizard status in recent years,
but clearly he has reclaimed his
position as Headmaster of Hog-
warts because "The Adventures
of Tintin" is a sight to behold.

displays an
altogether different kind of bite.
The series is the latest effort of
Australian comedian Chris Lilley
- who specializes in mockumen-
tary style episodes - in which he
introduces the audience to sev-
eral of his, characters, each more
charmingly offensive than the
last.
"Angry Boys" is no different,
starting off right out of the gun
with Daniel and Nathan Sims,
delinquent twin boys living in
rural Australia, and then moving
on to their prison guard grand-
mother, who runs the show at a
boy's juvenile facility.
The twins and their grand-
mother, all played by Lilley, are
awkwardly similar. Though
some sameness is expected,
there just isn't enough variation
- especiallyfor a character-driv-
en episodic series like this to
manufacture an easy shift from
each scene to the next. The view-
er may get tangled in the same-
ness of Lilley's accent, which is
largely unvaried between the
different characters, or be con-
fused by the seemingly random
assortment of scenes.
While Lilley struggles a bit to
bring range to his different dis-
guises, it's still fun to watch him
parade around as Gran, the ham-
ster-loving prison guard with a
penchant for making Superman
costumes and "gotcha!" jokes.

The 'U' isn't alive with the sound of SATB music

When I arrived at
Michigan nearly
three years ago, I,
like many other students, knew

my first semester of college.
But like my mom always says
(and kids, always listen to your
mother), the best wayto meet
new friends is to join a group of
people doing something - any-
thing - you truly love. And as
horribly cliche as it sounds, I love
to sing.
I was only four months out
of high school, and I could still
vividly remember the underclass-

men members of our Honors Con-
cert Choir singing the "Old Irish
Blessing" asa farewell to me and
my fellow seniors as I bawled into
my friend's shoulder. The memo-
ries I made as a member of HCC,
which was the top-auditioned
mixed choir at my high school,
were irreplaceable - and I was
eager to make more at Michigan.
But as I stumbled through Fes-
tifall's maze of flyers and sign-up
sheets, I soon realized with dis-
may that the group I was search-
ing for, the group I had looked
forward to joining ever since I
had accepted my spot in the class
of 2013, didn't seem to exist.
True, there is the University-
sponsored Arts Chorale. But that
is a class that participants must
register to be in. There are more
a cappella groups than I can
shakea stick at. But there is no
student-run, auditioned SATB
(Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass) choir
that focuses on competition-level
music aimed at non-music majors.
This is both extraordinary and

student-led performance teams
can flourish. Basement Arts is a
completely student-run theater
group with a long history of cre-
ative excellence - "A Very Potter
Musical" was born on their stage.
A cappella groups such as the
Dicks & Janes and the Compul-
sive Lyres also rely on student
talent to keep up their polished
performances.
But if ever there existed a
perfect template for what a large-
scale choir with the freedom of a
student group could look like at
Michigan, one would have to look
no further than the Michigan
Pops Orchestra.
This student-led group was
founded in 1995 by Warren Hsu, a
then-student and eventual physi-
cian who wanted a way to practice
music outside of the traditional
University framework while still
providing an exciting learning
experience for its members.
Having grown from a simple
idea shared among a few like-
minded musicians to a beloved
University staple run by a

13-member student executive
board, the Pops are a perfect
example of how a large student
extracurricular group with com-
plete control over their inner
workings can successfully flour-
ish while exposing themselves*
and their audiences to everything
from the challenges of Tchai-
kovsky to the magic of Disney.
The Pops are an invaluable
potential blueprint for what an
auditioned, student-led choir
for non-music majors could look
like. The interest is certainly
there, and though a capella isn't
for everyone, many students put
their collegiate vocal plans on
hold when they can't find a stu-
dent group that fits the bill.
Or is it? Does anyone else out
there who hasn't yet found what
they're looking for want to put
down their pencils, shut their
computers and warm up their
voices again?

BADGER BEATDOWN

MARISSA MCCLAIN/Daily
Wolverines maul Badgers from start to finish

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
On Sunday, alumni of the
Michigan men's basketball team
congregated at the Crisler Cen-
ter for the dedication of the new
practice building, the Player
Development Center. Wolverine
great Cazzie Russell challenged
the team, claiming that now that
Michigan has first-class facili-
ties, the production on the court
has to follow.
Message heard.
With a No. 18 Wisconsin team

in desperate need of a win com-
ing to town, Michigan held firm
in "the House that Cazzie Built"
and routed the Badgers, 59-41,
to give Michigan coach John
Beilein his first win against Wis-
consin.
"Ofthe jerseys that were hang-
ing, three of them (Russell, Rudy
Tomjanovich and Phil Hubbard)
were here and it was really nice,"
Beilein said. "They only spoke for
about 30 seconds each, Cazzie
maybe for a minute. And it was
probably better than any locker
room speech that any coach can

ever give. Because (the current
players are) looking at tradition,
they're looking at history, pride."
The Wolverines out-Wiscon-
sined Wisconsin by playing stin-
gy defense, hustling to earn extra
possessions and hitting free
throws to give the Badgers their
third-straight loss.
In a game played at a slow
pace - characteristic of Wiscon-
sin coach Bo Ryan - Michigan
(3-1 Big Ten, 13-3 overall) held
the Badgers to just 31-percent
shooting and forced their lowest
output of the season - 13 points

fewer than the previous low.
At the half, the Wolverines led
25-19 behind a balanced scor-
ing attack. And five minutes into
the second half, Wisconsin was
still stuck at 19. Michigan was
able to gain some distance on the
Badgers, starting off the second
frame on a 7-0 run.
Freshman point guard Trey
Burke befuddled Wisconsin's
star point guard, Jordan Taylor.
The All-American - who had
been averaging 20 points per
game in Big Ten play - couldn't
find an open shot against the

Columbus native. He scored just
12 points and managed only one
assist to three turnovers - the
inverse of his assist-to-turnover
ratio for the season.
"Trey did a phenomenal job
on Jordan Taylor," said sopho-
more forward Tim Hardaway Jr.
"And that's what we expect for
him throughout the whole entire
season. Just him being himself,
taking the challenge and being
a freshman who he is, he's not
going to back down from no one.
So great job on his part."
Burke also took it to the Bad-

He finished with 14 points.

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN
Contemplating the Winter Classic at the Big House

S ince 2008, the NHL has
been moving outdoors for
an afternoon every January
to play the Winter Classic. There's
been plenty
of winter and
plenty of clas-
sic.
The five
games have
been decided
by just seven
goals, hitting STEPHEN J.
some major NESBITT
venues: Ralph
Wilson Sta-
dium, Wrigley
Field, Fenway Park, Heinz Field
and Citizens Bank Park.
But the magnitude of those
events was upstaged by the Mich-
igan and Michigan State hockey
teams going at it in their backyard
last December. That backyard
held 110,000-plus fans who filled
Michigan Stadium to the brim.
The Wolverines trounced the
Spartans, 5-0, in the Big Chill at
the Big House. Carl Hagelin, the
Sodertalje, Sweden product, was
one of the heroes that day, scor-
ing a pair of goals. He said it was
a game and an environment that
he'll never forget.
"I think we all get goose-

bumps," Hagelin said after the
Big Chill. "The whole crowd was
going crazy. Everyone on the team
- everyone just feltcgreatbeing
a part of history, so that's some-
thing we can take with us. We just
loved being out there today."
A year later, he got to relive
the experience. But it wasn't the
same.
When Hagelin stepped onto
the ice for the Big Chill, he was
in a bowl surrounded by 113,411
rabid fans. When Hagelin, now a
member of the New York Rang-
ers, entered Citizens Bank Park in
Philadelphia for the 2012 Winter
Classic, he was greeted by 46,967
fans. In five years, the Winter
Classic has averaged 53,045 peo-
ple in attendance.
The numbers don't match up.
But now the NHL is putting
together a proposal that makes
sense. It's unorthodox, but it's
proven. It's professional, but it's
college. It's the Winter Classic,
but it's the Big Chill.
It's the Winter Classic at the
Big House.
The event is anything but offi-
cial, but Michigan Athletic Direc-
tor Dave Brandon announced that
the NHL had approached him
about using Michigan Stadium for

the next Winter Classic on Jan.
1, 2013.
(If you're concerned, trust in
TiVo, because it seems that the
Rose Bowl would be played the
same day.)
"We have been approached
by the NHL about utilizing our
facility for the 2013 Winter Clas-
sic," Brandon said ina statement
released this week. "There are
a lot of complex circumstances
that need to be ironed out before
anything moves forward. We will
have more to say if/when some-
thing materializes."
The match-up would likely be
the Detroit Red Wings and Toron-
to Maple Leafs - two Original Six
rivals. The Red Wings have been
in one previous Winter Classic,
drawing 4.4 million television
viewers in 2009.
But that edition of the Winter
Classic, hosted at Wrigley Field
against the Chicago Blackhawks,
held a capacity crowd of just
40,818. This would up the ante.
The hitch - because there
always must be one - is rather
mighty. The Red Wings are
ownedby mighty Mike Ilitch,
who also owns Little Caesar's
Pizza, Detroit Tigers and Com-
erica Park. If the Winter Classic

Then-senior forward Carl Hagelin scored twice in the Big Chill and participated in the Winter Classic last week.

were to be housed at an outside
venue, the profits from ticket
sales, merchandise, television
rights, vending and the like would
be split three ways instead of two.
If Illitch and the NHL struck
a deal to play the 2013 Winter
Classic at Comerica Park - one
of the venues being considered
- it would be easy money, but
the official capacity is 41,255.
The Big House would more than

double the attendance, providing
a stadium that could seat both
the Detroiters and the Canadians
coming across the bridge.
Most importantly, it's been
proven that hockey can pack
Michigan Stadium. And that was
college hockey.
This would be the Big Chill, but
it would be bigger. It would be dif-
ferent. It would be classic.
This Sunday, Michigan and

Ohio State will battle at the
Frozen Diamond Faceoff at Pro-
gressive Field in Cleveland. The
capacity is 43,441.
The Big House looks over and
smiles.
You musn't be afraid to dream a
little bigger, darling.

Shootout dooms 'M' again

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Michigan upsets Buckeyes
in bounce-back performance

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
If the Michigan hockey team
could score a shootout goal, it
would be in sole possession of
fourth place in the CCHA, instead
of seventh.
You know what the difference
between fourth and seventh is? A
bye in the first round of the CCHA
tournament, and an almost-guar-
anteed berth in the NCAA Tour-
nament.
And Michigan might miss out
- all because nobody can score a
one-on-one goal.
The Wolverines failed to con-
vert on their last five shootout
opportunities on Saturday, losing
to Lake Superior State, 2-2.
Michigan has lost its last three
shootount games, after earning the
program's first shootout win in
October at Northern Michigan,
but it's the way those losses are
coming that's concerning.
Michigan has converted just
two out of 15 shootout attempts
this season, not taking advantage
of a rule that would seemiligly
help the Wolverines. .
In 2008, the CCHA becamehthe
first conference in college hockey
to institute a post-overtime shoot-
out, granting the winner two
points in the standings, and the
loser one.
Michigan coach Red Berenson
and the rest of the league thought
Michigan was going to benefit
from this rule change, but after
three years, the Wolverines have
been the opposite of good.
"When they put the rule in,
they thought Michigan would
have the advantage," Berenson
said. "We've been the worst team
in the league on shootouts."
On Saturday, Michigan started
the overtime period looking to
score. With sophomore goalten-
der Adam Janecyk making his
first start of his career, Michigan
didn't want the game to be decid-
ed by ashootout.
The puck spent most of the five

ALDEN REISS/Daily
Sophomore forward Derek DeBlois missed his shootout attempt on Saturday.

overtime minutes in the Lakers'
end of the ice, but the Wolverines'
sense of urgency wasn't reward-
ed.
Sophomore forward Luke
Moffatt made the first shootout
attempt look easy, faking right,
then left before flipping the puck
into the top right corner to give
Michigan the early advantage.
Janecyk made the first two
saves, but then ceded the tying
shot on the third and final
attempt, sending the shootout
into sudden death. After Moffatt,
the next five Wolverines couldn't
convert.
Janecyk finally let in the win-
ning goal on Lake Superior State's
sixth attempt, but he shouldn't
shoulder any of the blame for the
shootout loss.
The Wolverine skaters looked
legitimately lost in the shootout.
Junior forward Chris Brown
missed the top post by about
four feet, and junior forward A.J.
Treais didn't even get a shot off,
losing the puck while he was skat-

ingup the ice.
"It's frustrating when we don't
hit the net on a shootout," Beren-
son said. "You put your top guys
out there and they can'thit the net
or find the puck. That's a big point
on the line."
The weekend wasn't a total
loss because of the shootout, but
getting four out of six points the
rest of the season won't cut it for a
seventh-place team.
For a team with as much tal-
ent as Michigan, the shootout
shouldn't be this perplexing. It
could be a lack of mental confi-
dence, or it could be because of a
lack of experience.
Whatever the reason, it's a part
of the game holding Michigan
back, and a part of the game that
is a concern for the Wolverines.
"I can't say that tonight is a
step forward for us," said senior
forward Luke Glendening. "We
threw that one away.
"We have to have those games
- to give that one away hurts. To
be so close, it's really frustrating."

With nine minutes left in the
Michigan women's basketball
game against Ohio State, the
Buckeyes began chipping away
at a 19-point deficit. Fueled by
the perfor-
mance of OHIO STATE 62
their only MICHIGAN 73
senior,
guard Samantha Prahalis, the
Buckeyes went on a 9-0 run.
It seemed like the momentum
was shifting in favor of the 11th-
ranked team in the nation.
The run hushed the crowd, and
fans weren't sure that the Wol-
verines could hold off Ohio State.
But for the Buckeyes, their
late-game push wasn't enough to
knock off their rival.
Michigan regained its com-
posure and finished the game
in stride, knocking off the then-
undefeated Buckeyes (2-1 Big
Ten, 15-1 overall) 73-62 Saturday
night at the Crisler Center.
The Wolverines (2-1, 13-3), who
boast the second-best scoring
defense in the Big Ten, kept Ohio
State's two leading scorers silent
for most of the game, stalling the
conference's best offense.
Prahalis missed 10 straight
shots and finished with 17 points.
Junior guard Tayler Hill, who
averages 22 points per game,
scored just 15. The duo shot a
combined 10-for-34.
Shutting down the two Buck-
eye guards was Michigan's main
priority, and the Wolverine
defense stepped up to the task.
"We were trying to do every-
thing we could to contain Praha-
lis and Hill," said Michigan coach
Kevin Borseth. "They're a hand-
ful. At the end of the game, they
just rammed it to the rim and we
couldn't stop them. They're just

very talented kids and very deter-
mined.
"We did everything we could
to try to keep them at bay."
Not only were Prahalis and
Hill contained, but Michigan was
able to keep up with the Ohio
State post players as well. The
Buckeyes' three physical centers
usually dominate the boards,
but the Wolverines limited Ohio
State's second-chance points and
narrowed the rebounding mar-
gin.
Michigangrabbed more defen-
sive boards than the Buckeyes
while only being outrebounded
by four. Though the Buckeyes
pulled down an unusually high
number of offensive rebounds -
17- the Wolverines' defense held
Ohio State to 13 second-chance
points.
The Wolverines knew defense
would be integral in the game,
so they focused on intensity for a
full 40 minutes.
"They're a great offensive
team," said senior guard Court-
ney Boylan, who was all smiles
after the upset. "I believe they are
averaginglike 80 points per game,
but I think we just really focused
on their main scoringthreats and
we tried to work to stop them. In
any game you play, you want to
come out with a lot of energy and
hustle because oftentimes that's
what wins you the game."
The Wolverines' defense did
more than just shut down Ohio
State's offensive production.
Michigan forced 15 turnovers and
scored 21 points off of them, and
used that momentum to produce
on offense.
Boylan led the team in scor-
ing with 19 points while junior
forwards Sam Arnold and Rachel
Sheffer broke into double digits,
scoring 13 and 11 points, respec-
tively. Seven of the nine Wolver-

ines who saw action scored.
Then there was Arnold off the
bench.
Arnold provided an integral
spark for the offense. She scored
7-straight points midwaythrough
the first half to retake the lead,
and as she hit a layup off of an
Ohio State turnover, the crowd
went wild.
Though the Wolverines con-
sistently look to their starters
for offense, they know the bench
has to be able to produce in order
to pull out a win. And Arnold's
season-high 13 points certainly
helped.
"Coming off the bench, I know
my role is to get in there and give
a spark and make the most out
of every minute I'm in there,"
Arnold said. "If my shots are fall-
ing, that's awesome. But I always
just try to do my best and go in
there with energy, and it means
a lot to be able to (get a season-
high) against such a big school
like Ohio State."
Borseth noted that both Arnold
and junior forward Kate Thomp-
son are consistent contributors to
the offense from the bench.
"That's the difference for us -
(the bench) has got to be able to
come in and contribute," Borseth
said. "That's part of who we are."
Together, the Wolverines were
firing on all cylinders and pulled
off their biggestwin of the season
to date.
With its first ranked opponent
defeated, Michigan looks to take
down No. 19 Penn State on the
road on Thursday.
But the Wolverines will savor
this win for a short while.
The team was joined in cel-
ebration with Michigan women's
basketball alumni, who were hon-
ored at the post-game gala, mak-
ing the third-straightvictory over
the Buckeyes a little bit sweeter.

Brandon talks Crisler renovationS Frm Page lB

By DANIEL WASSERMAN
Daily Sports Writer
On Dec. 2, 1967, the Univer-
sity Events Building opened its
doors for the first time, and the
Michigan basketball team, led
* by Rudy Tomjanovich, fell to
Adolph Rupp's Kentucky, 96-79.
The facility, dubbed "the
Great Dome," replaced Yost
Field House as the Wolverines'
home court to satisfy increased
ticket demand. Interest in the
men's basketball team had been
revitalized by Hall of Famer
and three-time All-American
Cazzie Russell, who led Michi-
gan to the Final Four in the 1964
and 1965 seasons, and another
NCAA tournament berth in the
1966 season.
Commonly referred to
as "The House that Cazzie
Built," the Events Building
was renamed Crisler Arena in
1970. And then, for 40 years, it
remained relatively unchanged.
Crisler Arena started to feel
dingy and dark, and the program
lacked a practice facility to lure
recruits to Ann Arbor. Players on
both the men's and women's team
had to share Crisler Arena's floor
and rarely had the opportunity to
put in extra work.
But over the past few years,
renovations began to brighten
up the inside of the recently
renamed Crisler Center. And
over the weekend, the men's and
women's programs celebrated
the dedication of the brand new
Player Development Center.
"We were not competitive
(and) we knew it," said Michigan
Athletic Director Dave Brandon.
"Frankly, we were not competi-
tive for too long, and it hurt us.
When you're spending hundreds
of millions of dollars on the foot-
ball stadium next door, and a
young student-athlete who's try-
ing to decide where to go play
basketball gets driven past the
Big House and sees that we only
have one gymnasium floor, we
don't have the infrastructure of
support that many of the other
premium basketball programs
have. It'svery difficult to recruit."
With the $23.2 million PDC
now complete, Brandon is shift-
ing his focus to the second phase
of the renovations - namely,
the addition of a new atrium
entrance and redesigned con-
course areas. Initially, the entire
project - currently under con-
struction - was to be completed

TODD NEEDLE/D
Michigan Athletic Director Dave Brandon said the Crisler Center renovations give Michigan a needed recruiting boost.

in 2014, but Brandon announced
on Sunday that it should be done
by next year.
"The Player Development Cen-
ter is now done, the arena is done,
but the biggest piece of this is now
underway and will be completed
about a year from now," Brandon
said. "You're taking a very old,
established structure and you're
expanding it, you're renovating
it, you're refreshing it and doing it
in a way that really makes it com-
petitive in today's world."
Brandon also released his lat-
est plans for what the new glass-
enclosed atrium will include. The
Crisler Center's atrium and con-
course will serve as an unofficial
museum of all things Michigan
athletics and will "feature and
celebrate" all 29 varsity programs.
"My vision for the concourse
area is: during pregame and dur-
ing halftime, I want that to be a
destination venue for the people
who come here," Brandon said.
"You will walk from area to area
and there will be flat-screen tele-
visions with videos and high-
lights and pictures and huge
graphics, and there will be one
basically devoted to every one of
our sports and every one of our
teams. It'll really be a celebration
of Michigan athletics in the con-
course and then you go into the
arena and you watch basketball."
One corner will also be the first
home of Michigan's Hall of Honor
- the Athletic Department's ver-
sion of a hall of fame. Inductees
to the Hall of Honor, which was

founded in 1978, were publicly
praised upon their induction but
otherwise went unrecognized.
"We've put some incredible
people in that and most people
don't know who they are," Bran-
don said. "They don't know what
happened. You're going to see one
section that will be devoted to the
Hall of Honor, where each year,
there will be the new recipients
who will really be celebrated and
recognized, and then every recipi-
ent will be memorialized in this
area."
With the opening of the PDC
came an opportunity for Brandon
and Michigan men's basketball
coach John Beilein to reach out to
former players. The program has
been criticized for not maintain-
ing close ties with alumni and its
history, especially after scandals
soured much of the 1990s.
That's what made this weekend
- which brought notable alumni
including Russell, Tomjanovich,
Campy Russell, Phil Hubbard and
Daniel Horton - so important.
"One of the things I stated the
first day I got this job was that
we really wanted to do every-
thing we could do to reach out
and bring the Michigan family
together, and that's not just one
sport - that's all of our sports,"
Brandon said. "Our men's basket-
ball program, with the coaching
changes we've had over the years
and some of the other things that
have happened, it's really caused
a lot of these former student ath-
letes to scatter and not have rea-

sons to come back to Ann Arbor.
"These things have not been
organized and coordinated -
well now they are."
Brandon said he "couldn't be
more thrilled" with the week-
end's turnout, but even though
the current celebration is focused
on the present, he is already look-
ing ahead to the future.
"This is just the first of what we
plan to do many times, and that
is: come up with reasons, celebra-
tions, opportunities to bring back
former players, bringback former
coaches and celebrate Michigan
basketball," Brandon said. "We
have a natural opportunity to
come next season because we're
going to hold a massive celebra-
tion when we complete the entire
Crisler project."
To do so, Brandon is planning
to host a big-name opponent to
create a buzz-worthy event that
will draw fans and former players
to the grand opening in January
or February of 2013.
"We absolutely want there
to be a big-brand opponent that
comes in that just rounds off the
whole weekend," said Brandon,
who isn't sure who the opponent
will be. "We want to have a big
game, we want to have a big turn-'
out of former players - men and
women - hopefully some former
coaches and really celebrate the
investment that we've made in
this program, as well as the tradi-
tion and history of Michigan bas-
ketball. We're already planning
that. It's going to be a big deal."

the penalty kill. He made the
easy saves and the Lakers didn't
score on their power play,
though Janecyk was caught
out of position more than once.
Michigan also found itself on
the receiving end of "puck
luck" - Lake Superior State
either missed a wide-open tar-
get or just barely had their shot
deflected in another direction.
The game remained relatively
quiet until the end of the second
period.
.Senior forward David Wohl-
berg's shot was saved by Laker
netminder Kevin Kalpalka, but
deflected off a defenseman and
into the net with five minutes
left in the stanza.
Lake Superior State (6-6-2,
12-9-3) briefly tied it up, but
freshman forward Alex Guptill
gave the Wolverines the all-
important lead going into the
third frame.
An unfortunate bounce off of
Janecyk's pads slid the puck to
the stick of Lake Superior State's
Buddy Robinson, and Robinson
had no problem poking the puck
past Janecyk to knot the game
at the beginning of the third
period.
If you ask the players, they
will tell you that was the game's
turning point.
"To be up one goal in the
third period, you've got to win
the little battles," said senior
forward Luke Glendening. "We
did some of that tonight, but we
weren't burying our chances. To
be so close, it's frustrating."
The frustration was a
180-degree turn for Michigan,
which was riding high on Friday
night after pulling out a victory
over the Lakers.
Friday saw the season debut
of sophomore defenseman Jon
Merrill, who was suspended
from the team since the begin-
ning of the season for a violation
of team rules.
He tallied his first point of
the year with an assist on Wohl-
berg's goal.
Hunwick also made big saves,
and kept Lake Suerior State
off the boards until the second
period. But then he was hit by
an injury.
The team wouldn't disclose
the nature of Hunwick's ail-
ment. Midway through the first
period, a Laker slapshot hit the
netminder in the mask, send-
ing Hunwick and his helmet to

the ice. Hunwick was visibly
rattled, but he slowly got up and
went back tothe net, where he
remained until the third stanza
when Janecyk got the call.
Michigan was clinging to a
one-goal lead with nine minutes
left in Friday's game.
But a frantic, back-and-forth
last couple of minutes combined
with an empty-net goal from
junior forward Chris Brown
sealed the game for Janecyk and
the Wolverines.
If Janecyk looked scared Fri-
day when he took to the ice, he
didn't show it on Saturday.
Sometime prior to the game
on Saturday, the trainers decid-
ed Hunwick wasn't ready to
play, so Janecyk had all day to
mentally prepare himself for the
game.
"We weren't
burying our
chances ... it's
frustrating."
"Ask a goalie, they'll tell
you 90 percent of playing goal
is mental," Berenson said. "If
(Janecyk) talked himself into a
good frame of mind, then he'd
be ready.
"I'm sure the other team is
pressing too. Without Hunwick
in the net, they think they can
take advantage of a new goalie.
It wasn't so."
Janecyk stopped 34 shots
during Saturday's game and
denied four of six shots during
the shootout.
"(Janecyk) doesn't have a
lot of game experience, but we
expect him to come in and do a
job," Glendening said. "Every-
one is his biggest fan on this
team. That confidence in him
gave us confidence."
The shootout loss was diffi-
cult for the Wolverines to swal-
low, especially when the tide
seemingly began to turn after
a long winless streak span-
ning the month of November.
Though one could argue that
walking away with four points
this weekend is better than just
three, the team doesn't see it
that way.
"It was a step forward with
the win," Glendening said. "I
can't say (Saturday) is a step for-
ward for us. We threw that one
away."

help build the Wolverine lead. The
sophomore forward also made
seven of his eight free throws to
help him to a game-high 17 points.
"He just was very selective,"
Beilein said. "You play Wisconsin,
it's not a time to get thirsty. It's a
time you've got to be very selec-
tive, and he was. I love the quality
of the 3-pointers that we took."
The Wolverines bounced back
emphatically from Thursday's

73-71 loss at Indiana, showing
that they can keep pace with the
12th-ranked Hoosiers and No.
6 Ohio State, the other one-loss
teams that sit behind conference
leader Michigan State (3-0, 14-2).
"We took more of the approach
that we could use that loss to help
us win today," Novak said. "Sulk-
ing over it's not goingto help us. If
we use it to get a win today, then
it's worth it."
Wisconsin (1-3, 12-5) never
threatened Michigan in the sec-
ond half. The closest it came to
a single-digit deficit came when
Traevon Jackson nailed a 3-point-

er to make it 36-26.
But it was just one of very few
open looks the Badgers could
muster in the game.
"(That was) probably the best
I've seen us play defensively,"
Novak said. "Everyone was just
on the same page all night with
our rotations, switches. There
was never a play that I remem-
ber where someone just blatantly
missed an assignment. When
everyone's there mentally and
playing hard, those are the two
biggest things with defense."
That's one way to beat the Bad-
gers for the first time in five years.
