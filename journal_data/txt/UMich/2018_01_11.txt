To mark the beginning of the 

University of Michigan’s Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day Symposium, 
the Institute for Social Research 
held 
a 
panel 
Wednesday 

afternoon discussing the various 
effects of gentrification in Detroit 
and across the United States.

The University’s theme for this 

year’s MLK symposium is “The 
Fierce Urgency of Now,” which 
Dory Knight-Ingram, a senior 
editor for the Institute of Social 
Research, explained relates deeply 
to the topic of gentrification.

“Gentrification is now and 

it is urgent,” she said. “It is a 
multifaceted situation, and there 
is no simple answer, but we are 
trying to raise awareness.”

Piper Simmons, a coordinator 

for 
the 
Inter-University 

Consortium for Political and 
Social Research which organized 
the day’s events, explained the 
consortium chose the topic of the 
panel with care. Gentrification, 
she noted, engages with both the 
MLK symposium theme and the 
University’s ongoing diversity, 
equity and inclusion initiative.

The panelists examined the 

effects of gentrification through 
diverse lenses of sociology, social 
work, 
architecture, 
personal 

experience 
and 
population 

studies. Their overarching goal, 
explained Margaret Levenstein, 
director of ICPSR, was to provide 
the audience with the tools to 
think about this multifaceted and 

fast-growing issue.

“I think this is a great panel, 

and one of the things I really 
like about having a discussion 
like this is that people often feel 
like gentrification is something 
which happens to them,” she said. 
“I’m hoping that having these 
various perspectives will help us 
to understand better how we can 
all have agency in determining 
the future of the communities in 
which we live.”

Panelist Shayna Brown, a 2017 

Music, Theatre & Dance graduate, 
revealed she has been thinking 
about the effect of gentrification 
since her freshman year at the 
University when she came home 
from school and asked her mother 
about new construction in Detroit. 
Many have hailed the city’s 
comeback in recent years, with 
millions of dollars in investments 
pouring 
into 
development 

downtown, but residents like 
Brown’s family found themselves 
left behind. 

“She was like, ‘That’s not for us, 

that’s for tourists,’” Brown said. “I 
thought, ‘That’s an odd thing to 
say,’ and I didn’t understand, so I 
decided to do research.”

Brown 
conducted 
an 

independent 
study 
on 

gentrification and, like all four 
panelists, remains invested in the 
complex issue.

Other 
panelists 
included 

Tam 
Perry, 
assistant 
social 

work professor at Wayne State 

LSA 
Student 
Government 

convened for the first meeting of 
the winter semester Wednesday 
evening 
to 
discuss 
three 

upcoming resolutions regarding 
the academic calendar and 
building 
conditions 
at 
the 

University of Michigan. 

Public Policy junior Lauren 

Schandevel and LSA junior 
Meaghan 
Wheat 
attended 

the meeting to discuss their 
resolution that would create 
a new minor: Collaborative 
Learning Across Socioeconomic 
Statuses. Schandevel and Wheat 
said they hope to bring related 
courses together and encourage 
students to take courses across 
departments, including African 
and 
Afro-American 
Studies, 

American Culture, Economics, 
History, 
Psychology, 
Public 

Policy, Sociology and Women’s 
Studies. 

The pair said they have 

gathered support from various 
department chairs, and have 
received 
expressed 
interest 

from 
the 
Sociology 
and 

Women’s Studies Departments

Activists 
demonstrating 

against Ann Arbor’s deer cull 
discovered a homeless man 
living in a designated shooting 
zone for the cull Tuesday.

The deer cull began in 2015 

after City Council approved 
sharpshooters to reduce the 
population of deer.

The demonstrators said their 

discovery 
demonstrates 
the 

city’s negligence in organizing 
the cull, which is currently in 
its third day of operation. City 
administrators were unaware 
the man was sleeping near one 
of the bait piles used in the cull.

The homeless man, who 

was visited and interviewed 
Tuesday by The Ann Arbor 
News, said he is aware of the 
culling operations and has not 
been in any immediate danger. 
He said he is confident in the 
contractor’s safety protocols 
and isn’t concerned about his 
safety.

University alum Sean Smith 

graduated last winter, and now 
works as a fellow in LSA Dean 
Andrew Martin’s office. When 
he goes home to visit his family, 
Smith says his family relies on 
him for more information on 
current events. Recently, his 
family has been pressing him 
about the passing of the tax bill, 
but narratives like his family’s 
are often left out of resources, 
leaving Smith, and many others, 
confused.

“When I went home, the first 

thing my family asked me was 
how I feel about the tax bill,” 
Smith said. “They expect me 
to have the knowledge being 
first-gen, but I just haven’t been 
able to find it. The biggest thing 
that I can say is that there is no 
perspective from my tax bracket 
in the conversation. That should 
be telling.”

In late December, Congress 

passed the most sweeping rewrite 
of the U.S. tax code in decades. The 

bill slashed the corporate tax rate, 
doubled the size of inheritances 
shielded from taxes and allowed 
pass-through businesses greater 
deduction. But most startling to 
many students at the University 
of Michigan are the changes for 
individual taxpayers.

According 
to 
PBS 
News, 

Americans 
making 
over 

$500,000 a year would see a 
net benefit worth 3 percent of 
their income – approximately 
$21,000 in 2019. However, all 
Americans making $30,000 will 
be giving up more in taxes, and 
middle-class Americans making 
between $40,000 and $75,000 
will have tax cuts that dwarf in 
comparison to those of upper-
class Americans.

In 
Washington, 
D.C., 

Democrats 
voiced 
strong 

opposition to the bill. Senate 
Minority Leader Sen. Chuck 
Schumer, D-N.Y., went so far as 
to say the bill is ruining America 
because of the financial burden 
it will place on low-income 
Americans.

But at the University, which

Councilmembers echo calls from 70 residents for civilian police review board 

Seventy Ann Arbor residents 

called for increased accountability 
and transparency from the Ann 
Arbor 
Police 
Department 
at 

the Ann Arbor Human Rights 
Commission 
Wednesday. 

This comes after several local 
incidents of police brutality, and 
institutional 
responses 
many 

residents view as insufficient.

Because of the unprecedented 

number of residents in attendance, 

a member of the fire department 
stopped by on an anonymous 
tip to move the HRC to the City 
Council Workroom. Participants 
carried signs with slogans such 
as “Civilian Police Review Now!” 
and “No false solutions.”

Difficulties 
with 
relations 

between the AAPD and the Ann 
Arbor community erupted in 2014 
when an AAPD officer shot and 
killed 40-year-old Aura Rosser, 
a Black woman, after the officer 
claimed Rosser had charged at 
him with a knife. 

Rosser’s death was not the 

only example of the AAPD’s 
questionable use of force. Since 
Rosser’s 
death, 
numerous 

incidents such as the violent 
arrest 
of 
Ciaeem 
Slaton 
at 

the Blake Transit Center, the 
rough handling of University 
of 
Michigan 
student 
Dyshon 

Toxey and alleged mistreatment 
of several Black students during 
tailgates have led residents to 
question whether these are issues 
of race and how the AAPD can be 
held accountable for their actions.

Residents have reacted to the 

tenuous 
relationship 
between 

the police and citizens through 
various protests and initiatives 
calling for a new way of policing 
the AAPD. While the Ann Arbor 
City Council initially responded 
to the uproar in early 2017 by 
approving a $200,000 contract 
with a consulting firm, Hillard 
Heintze LLC, many residents 
considered the unsatisfying, and 
even counteractive. 

Long-time Ann Arbor resident 

Shirley 
Beckley 
expressed 

frustration with the long-standing 
impasse in relations with AAPD.

WOLVE RINE OF THE WE E K

Every Thursday, The Michigan 
Daily will feature a member of 
the campus community. This 
week we asked: what is the 
strangest thing you believe? 

“My family, we always 
wash our faces with 
the first snow because 
you’re not supposed to 
get sick if you do that. 
The first time it snows 
a year if you go outside 
and wash your face 
with it, no matter what 
time it is, you’re not 
going to to get sick for 
the whole year… and 
I’m always healthy.” 

LSA sophomore Kysia Jones

“This is not a problem we 

should still be struggling with,” 
she said. “We should not still be 
struggling with issues from the 
1970s.”

She 
addressed 
City 

Administrator Howard Lazarus 
later in the meeting.

“I don’t trust you,” she stated. 

“I don’t trust the police. No one 
has apologized for killing Aura 
Rosser. Not yet. But you ask us to 
trust you. Trust is earned.”

Transforming 
Justice 

Washtenaw, 
a 
group 
that 

advocates 
for 
restorative 

alternatives to policing and 
incarceration, 
opened 
the 

HRC meeting with members 
Lori Saginaw and Julie Quiroz 
reading a statement they sent 

to the mayor, City Council, city 
administrator and HRC prior 
to the meeting. The statement 
requested the formation of a 
Civilian Police Review Board 
instead of the “Co-Produced 
Policing Committee” the city is 
pursuing. 

“We call on the Ann Arbor 

City Council to take immediate 
steps 
directing 
the 
city 

administrator to put in place a 
Civilian Police Review Board 
that is independent, transparent, 
representative and adequately 
funded, based on the specific 
features outlined below. This 
CPRB should be in place no later 
than January 2019,” Saginaw 
said.

Several 
HRC 
members, 

including 
Dwight 
Wilson, 

shared a sense of urgency.

“We need to stop dancing 

around and just do this. We have 

all kinds of people telling us to do 
it, and even if we didn’t, common 
sense should tell us that we need 
to protect the citizens,” Wilson 
said.

The HRC formally proposed 

a CPRB a year after Rosser’s 
death in 2015, and again with 
a unanimous statement in July 
2016. AAPD chief Jim Baird, on 
the other hand, blasted the idea 
in the summer of 2016, arguing 
implementing oversight before a 
third-party review would be too 
hasty. 

“Because the commission’s 

report 
blends 
the 
national 

discussion 
with 
the 
Rosser 

incident, I have concern that 
there may be an appetite to 
address national issues and 
concerns with local policy,” 
Baird wrote in a memo. “To 
presume that the Ann Arbor 
Police Department’s practices 

are not ‘positive’ and that a 
review board is the best way 
to ‘ensure future adherence’ 
absent 
any 
supporting 

reference is ill advised...
(civilian oversight) becomes 
a mechanism for people who 
are sometimes disenchanted 
with police departments to 
become more disenchanted, 
because all they see is the 
problem.”

Throughout the meeting 

residents emphasized the 
importance of a review 
board 
comprised 
of 

residents rather than the 
Hillard Heinze proposed 
Co-Produced 
Policing, 

which 
would 
include 

commissioners, 
policemen 

and council members.

Similarly, 
residents 

expressed doubt regarding 
the effectivity of a CPPC. 
The CPPC cannot conduct 
investigations 
and 
can 

only review from outside 
investigations 
via 
the 

AAPD’s Office of Internal 
Affairs, working as a third-
party liaison between the 
public and the police. The 

residents 
argued 
a 
Civilian 

Police Review Board would take 
a more direct approach.

Saginaw emphasized amid 

applause they were prepared to 
take action and get involved.

“We are ready,” Saginaw said. 

“Give us a date. We want to help.”

Transforming 
Justice 

Washtenaw stated the CPRB 
would 
exclude 
current 
and 

former 
employees 
of 
the 

AAPD, 
unlike 
the 
CPPC. 

Furthermore, the CPRB would 
be a place of transparency, 
where citizens, City Council and 
the AAPD would be regularly 
informed on complaints and 
corresponding action taken to 
alleviate community relations. 
Finally, Transforming Justice 
Washtenaw 
proposes 
that 

the CPRB would be made up 
of nine members of various 
marginalized people groups.

Lazarus 
explained 
his 

vision for the CPRB composed 
primarily 
of 
City 
Council 

members and commissioners, 
bringing new Deputy Police 
Chief Jason Forsberg on to 
help assemble the team. Many 
residents 
and 
even 
some 

councilmembers disagreed with 
his proposal.

Councilmember 
and 
HRC 

member 
Sumi 
Kailasapathy, 

D-Ward 
1, 
argued 
it 
does 

not make sense to have law 
enforcement policing the AAPD.

“I feel that a deputy of police 

leading this board, I don’t know 
if conflict of interest is the right 
word,” Kailasapathy questioned.

While 
the 
residents 
and 

HRC continued to discuss the 
implementation of a review 
board, the council seemed to 
reach a compromise when they 
decided to allow residents to 
submit their names in order to 
be selected for a task force to 
provide input in the formation of 
a commission. 

Residents were advised to 

offer nominations and submit 
their requests to join the task 
force to hrc@a2gov.org.

Second year psychology graduate student Rachel Fine presents her research on the perceived loyalty of dual nationals as part of the Social 
Brown Bag speaker series at East Hall Wednesday.

SOCIAL BROWN BAG

to house the new minor, if 
approved.

LSA SG President Nicholas 

Fadanelli, 
an 
LSA 
senior, 

reviewed A.R. 7-026, a resolution 
calling upon the University 
to compensate CSG members 
for their time and their work. 
This proposal was previously 
approved, then vetoed by CSG. 

On Jan. 9, CSG President 

Anushka Sarkar, LSA senior, 
reiterated her reasoning for 
vetoing the proposal, stating 
she had worries about how the 
resolution would affect students 
without the organization. 

“I 
support 
the 
spirit 
of 

the resolution and I believe 

in 
financial 
support 
in 

compensation for just labor 
as 
we 
and 
other 
student 

governments do, but I take issue 
with some of the specifics of how 
the resolution would actually 
impact students in CSG and the 
organization’s integrity,” she 
said.

Sarkar stated she would be 

open to discussing other forms 
of compensation that would 
not 
risk 
exposing 
personal 

information or affecting internal 
decisions. However, at the LSA 
SG meeting, Fadanelli said he 
put out an LSA executive board 
statement against the proposal 
as many members in LSA SG 
have expressed concerns. 

LSA SG also discussed a 

resolution 
in 
support 
of 
a 

revision 
to 
the 
2020-2021 

academic 
calendar 
proposed 

by the Office of the Registrar, 
which 
would 
begin 
classes 

before Labor Day. 

Fadanelli advocated for the 

proposal, stating starting the 
school year one week earlier 
would 
prevent 
final 
exams 

continuing through Dec. 23, as 
they have in previous years. 

The University of Michigan 

is one of the five universities 
in the Big Ten that begins after 
Labor Day. The list includes 
Northwestern University, which 
uses the quarter system instead 
of the semester system.

According to a survey of 

about 800 students, Fadanelli 
stated about 70 percent were in 
favor of starting the academic 
year a week before Labor Day, 
 

with 20 percent opposed and 12 

percent indifferent. The main 
concerns with the proposal 
were how it would affect spring/
summer programs and move-in 
for University housing.

“The one thing we have to do 

as a government is weigh the 
pros and cons of a solution,” he 
said.

If the resolution is passed, 

students and University staff 
would have two-years notice to 
accommodate for summer and 
move-in plans.

LSA SG also discussed a 

resolution that would recognize 
United States Election Day as 
an academic holiday and would 
discourage course exams on all 
local, state and federal election 
days. Wyatt Puscas, LSA SG 
student advisory council for 
departmental affairs vice chair, 

argued 
this 
would 
improve 

student turnout at elections, 
and cited studies that showed 
involvement in elections at a 
young age encourages continued 
involvement throughout one’s 
lifetime. Main concerns of the 
proposal included the financial 
cost of missing an entire day of 
classes and whether students 
would actually use the day to 
exercise their civic duties.

Fadanelli 
reiterated 
the 

University is required to have 
a minimum number of days in 
class and if the University were 
to not hold class on Election Day, 
there would simply be another 
day of class added another time 
in the year, perhaps in the week 
before Labor Day. Other schools, 
he said, may not provide accurate 
parallels for the University to 

model policy off of.

“Sometimes we have to be the 

leaders and the best,” Fadanelli 
said.

LSA SG also discussed a 

resolution 
advocating 
for 

the 
improved 
conditions 
of 

staircases within the Mason, 
Angell, Tisch and Haven Hall 
complex, sponsored by LSA SG 
representatives Patrick Miller 
and Brian Wang. Miller and 
Wang expressed this complex 
is one of the most visited and 
decrepit locations on campus, 
and that LSA SG has received 
various complaints that the 
stairwell, especially in the math 
wing, is bordering hazardous. 

The facilities director has 

reportedly been responsive and 
expressed interest to renovate 
soon.

brought to light the difficulty 
in standardizing a definition of 
gentrification. 
They 
generally 

agreed, though, the trend involves 
strategic, 
accelerated 
change 

in a neighborhood, and often 
comprises 
increasing 
wealth 

disaprities. 

They continued to discuss 

how neighborhoods shape our 
lives, and examined the costs and 
benefits of neighborhood change.

Detroit 
and 
other 
large 

metropolitan 
areas 
are 
not 

the only places impacted by 
gentrification. To that effect, 
students 
themselves 
can 
be 

involved in the gentrification 
process. Gentrification in Ann 
Arbor is particularly prominent, 
with costs of housing surrounding 

campus on the rise. A report 
by The Daily last fall found the 
median rent in the city increased 
by 14 percent from 2010 to 2015 
— the survey showed the average 
monthly rent of respondents to 
be approximately $772. Luxury 
high rise apartments sprouting 
up close to campus have some 
students worried about being 
priced out. 

The event’s audience consisted 

largely of community members 
and University students interested 
in gentrification and sociology.

LSA 
sophomore 
Grace 

Lees said she attended the 
symposium because it related 
to her Undergraduate Research 
Opportunity Program project on 
neighborhood segregation and 
community health.

“I think it’s really cool that U 

of M hosts these events during 
the 
month 
of 
January. 
It’s 

evident, especially where I grew 
up in Boston, that there is racial 
segregation in certain areas,” she 
said. “It’s such a dynamic issue 
— economically, politically and 
socially. I’m at this event to hear a 
couple different sides.”

has 
been 
criticized 
for 
its 

high concentration of upper-
class students —t he median 
family income of a student at 
the University is $154,000 — 
multitudes 
of 
high-income 

students say they find themselves 
reconciling their tax cuts with 
the burdens low-income students 
could face. The average University 
student, then, would stand to gain 
approximately $2,094 in the next 
fiscal year under the new tax plan. 
The 3,000 students on campus 
recieving free tuition via the new 
Go Blue Guarantee, on the other 
hand, hail from families with 
household incomes of $65,000 or 
less. At most, these lower income 
brackets will recieve 150 percent 
less than the average University 
student. The lowest brackets 
could lose as much as $384 over 
the next two years. 

Public Policy junior Lauren 

Schandevel said the tax increases 
on low-income households could 
generate issues for them while 
upper-class 
students 
remain 

untouched.

“The eventual tax increase 

and healthcare premium hike 
on lower- and middle-income 
households will make paying for 
college –– and necessities like 
rent, food and textbooks –– even 
less likely, while the sustained 
cut for higher-income households 
will allow wealthier students to 
purchase all of these things with 
plenty to spare,” Schandevel said.

However, 
Engineering 

sophomore 
Lincoln 
Merrill, 

publicity chair of the University’s 
chapter of College Republicans, 
said people will face different 
financial impacts from the tax bill 
because of factors like size of the 
household. He said blaming the 
differences on high or low income 
is for purely political reasons.

“Overall, most people will 

benefit with only a few people 
not benefitting from the new 
bill,” Merrill said. “However, 
this has nothing to do with 
high-income versus low-income 
households but rather depends 
on other factors such as size and 
location of the household among 
other factors. The claims that the 
new bill will help high-income 
students while hurting lower 
income students are completely 
false and likely have been made 
on political grounds alone as even 

low-income students will benefit, 
in some cases more than high-
income students.”

Nursing 
sophomore 
Lori 

Fong said her parents now make 
a relatively high income, but 
originally came from a lower 
socioeconomic status. She said the 
tax bill will only reinforce cycles 
of poverty, something her family 
was lucky to escape.

“If you have parents who make 

a generally high income, then 
you are going to be more likely to 
succeed. You have that advantage 
already. People who complain 
about money going to lower-
income people, but then complain 
about there being lower-income 
people… it’s just hypocritical,” 
Fong said.

Smith said articles written 

usually quote people who make 
around six figures, leaving little 
context for those who are already 
marginalized. Still, he said he 
doesn’t 
feel 
any 
resentment 

toward people who will benefit 
from the bill.

“I don’t feel any resentment,” 

he said. I just try to inform people 
of the privilege they do have, but 
at the same time, not shame them. 
“I just need people to think about 
it.”

members of Friends of Ann 
Arbor Wildlife in Nature, a 
local 
animal 
rights 
group, 

claimed to have seen people 
entering Ann Arbor parks while 
sharpshooters were working, 
uninformed 
the 
contractors 

were shooting at the time.

Lisa 
Abrams, 
a 
FAAWN 

organizer, 
suggested 
other 

homeless people may be living 
near the cull areas. FAAWN 
is urging the city to postpone 
further cull operations until 
more thorough safety protocols 
are established.

City 
officials 
emphasize 

that 
the 
hired 
contractor, 

White Buffalo, Inc., continues 
to follow the safety measures 
outlined 
by 
City 
Council. 

According 
to 
MLive, 
Lisa 

Wondrash, 
communications 

director at White Buffalo, said 
the contractor is continually 
observing the area to look 
for any other people or safety 
hazards. White Buffalo also 
utilizes night-vision technology, 

allowing 
sharpshooters 

distinguish between deer and 
people or other animals. They 
also 
have 
enacted 
security 

protocols, like the use of night 
vision technology, to make sure 
people don’t enter the cull areas 
while operations are taking 
place.

This is the city’s third annual 

deer cull, and the contractor 
aims to eliminate 250 deer by 
Jan. 31. The cull will likely 
continue as planned in the 
coming days. 

Although 
the 
cull 
began 

from 
complaints 
regarding 

deer harming their properties 
— it has always been a subject 
of controversy in Ann Arbor. 
Supporters, such as University 
bioligists, claim it is the most 
effective 
way 
to 
prevent 

car 
accidents, 
the 
spread 

of 
disease, 
and 
ecological 

damage. However, oppononents 
criticize the city for not being 
transparent 
enough 
in 
its 

dealings regarding the cull.

The University of 

Michigan is not playing 
around — on Jan. 13 and 14, 
the University of Michigan 
School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance will host for the first 
time the North American 
Conference on Video Game 
Music for its fifth annual 
gathering. The conference 
will feature discussions 
on the different aspects of 
video game music, such as 
composition and music theory, 
and seeks to bring together 
scholars who specialize in 
these topics.

The first annual 

conference was hosted at 
Youngstown State University 
in 2014 and the conference 
is now levelling up to the 
University of Michigan. The 
2014 conference was the 
first conference to address 
video game music relative to 
academia. William Gibbons, 

a conference organizer at the 
event, spoke of the influence 
such a topic can have within 

the scholarly world, especially 
considering the rising 
popularity of video game 

music studies.

“I think it’s an extremely 

important event that’s 
happening at a great time for 
game studies. Video games 
as an academic pursuit have 
been increasingly popular 
and increasingly relevant to 
scholars, and game music 
studies are starting to catch 
up to that. I think it has 
the potential to be a really 
important event for the field,” 
Gibbons said.

Music, Theatre & Dance 

assistant professor Matthew 
Thompson, who teaches a 
minicourse at the University 
on video game music and 
doubles as a classical pianist, 
is the lead organizer of this 
year’s event. He stated the 
impact of video game music 
extends beyond technology 
and gaming as it also utilizes 
the work of traditional 
orchestras across the world. 

“The number one reason 

that video game music exists 
is to increase immersion,” 
Thompson said. “Early on, the 
programmers were the same 
people who composed. Game 
audio has progressed so much 
since then, that now there are 
huge music budgets for these 
AAA games that are recorded 
by the top orchestras in the 
world and highly interactive, 
complex musical scores.”

The program committee 

also includes professors from 
the University of Hartford, 
University of Texas at Austin, 
Davidson College, Ithaca 
College, Ohio State University 
and Youngstown State 
University. The conference 
will offer eight sessions, 
each highlighting a different 
theme and bringing forward a 
variety of presenters.

I

n mid-November, news 
broke that Senator Al 
Franken, D-Minn., had 

forcibly kissed and groped 
radio 
newscaster 
Leann 

Tweeden on a USO tour 
in December 2006. On the 
morning after the story came 
out, I woke up and listened 
to NPR’s “Up First” while 
scrambling eggs, like every 
other morning. I had heard 
about the story via Twitter 
the 
evening 
before, 
but 

wasn’t aware of the details. I 
listened to the podcast hosts 
report on what had happened, 
and I began to deliberate 
about whether I thought he 
should resign. After a while, 
I decided I was ambivalent. 
It felt to me as if forcing him 
to resign suggested he was 
the only sitting U.S. senator 
who had sexually harassed 
someone. I thought certainly 
no one believed that.
 I discovered later that day 
that I was entirely wrong. 
My peers, most of whom 
are staunch liberals, were 
shocked by this news. They 
loved Al Franken — how 
could he betray them like 
this? 
How 
could 
such 
a 

liberal “feminist” sexually 
assault women? It was not 
only my circle of friends who 
reacted in this manner; even 
the hosts of the podcast “Pod 
Save America” discussed how 
distraught they were that an 
idol of theirs had turned out 
to be a predator. As I heard all 
of this, I was flabbergasted. 
Did my friends and favorite 
podcasters really believe that 
every time they saw #MeToo 
on their timelines, it was in 
reference to a Republican? 
That voting to fund Planned 
Parenthood 
and 
speaking 

against Donald Trump meant 
someone was exempt from 
being an abuser?
 It became clear to me that 
many 
people 
did 
believe 

these things. While revealing 
powerful liberal men also 
abuse women felt to me like 
“revealing” a lot of the people 
drinking at Garage Bar are 
well under 21, it turns out 
that many very smart people 

were caught by total surprise. 
It sometimes feels as though 
I’m 
trapped 
in 
an 
echo 

chamber with the people and 
media with which I surround 
myself, so it felt odd to have 
such a different perspective.
 The best explanation I have 
for my viewpoint is my past 
experiences. I was groped 

at 15 by a former friend, I 
was raped at 16 by a former 
boyfriend 
and 
sexually 

assaulted at 18 by a former 
friend and current friendly 
acquaintance. I’ve spent a lot 
of time (read: a very painful 
five years) thinking about 
those moments. I’ve assessed 
those men and their actions 
for so long, and yet it never 
occurred to me that their 
political affiliation would be 
relevant to their behavior. 
That is because it is not; 
those three men hold wildly 
different views on politics 
in general and on women’s 
issues specifically. Somehow, 
their views on abortion never 
made me feel more forgiving 
toward or more surprised by 
one over another. Being a public 
advocate for women’s rights and 
a private abuser of women only 
makes someone a hypocrite, not 
a “better” abuser.
 Sexual assault is a violent 
crime, not a partisan issue. 
We 
were 
all 
brought 
up 

surrounded 
by 
a 
culture 

of sexual assault that has 
historically 
allowed 
men 

to abuse their power and 

privilege 
without 
much 

punishment. 
We 
must 
all 

recognize that no matter how 
progressive or egalitarian our 
values are, we are affected and 
influenced by that predatory 
culture. For example, I was 
ambivalent toward Franken’s 
resignation for quite a while. 
I was convinced otherwise 
by Ana Marie Cox’s article in 
Esquire, which is summarized 
in 
this 
quote: 
“I 
think 

Franken should voluntarily 
relinquish 
a 
privilege 
in 

recognition 
that 
women’s 

voices and experiences are 
more 
important 
than 
his 

short-term political career.” 
I don’t know why that simple 
point was so difficult for me 
to understand from the start. 
I know I would feel personally 
insulted, disheartened and 
enraged each day if one of my 
abusers held public office. 
While I also know that there 
are hundreds of victims who 
must live with that horrible 
reality, it is one that we 
should actively try to reduce.
 So, if I was right, and there 
is at least one other U.S. 
senator who is guilty of 
sexual misconduct, and even 
if there are 30 of them, and 
even if they’re all Democrats, 
I sincerely hope they will be 
outed and removed. If it ruins 
Democratic chances of ever 
winning back Congress, so 
be it. We cannot be a party 
that puts abusers in power 
and justifies it by claiming 
that things would be worse 
for women if we lost their 
votes. I certainly understand 
that argument; I understand 
that 
reproductive 
freedom 

is at risk, we desperately 
need maternity leave and 
that the Republican Party 
has no intention of helping 
women on these issues. I also 
understand that as long as we 
are complicit in propping up 
abusers, women’s safety and 
autonomy is not a priority of 
the Democratic Party either.

I 
 

am 
both 
an 
early-

morning 
person 
and 

a 
runner. 
These 
two 

characteristics 
aren’t 

mutually 
exclusive, 
but 

both 
have 
one 

similarity: “This 
American 
Life.” 

“This 
American 

Life” is a podcast 
produced by NPR 
and 
narrated 

predominantly by 
Ira Glass. It has 
different weekly 
themes, 
with 

stories 
ranging 

from things people regret 
to how Greece is helping 
Syrian refugees. For the last 
six years, I have religiously 
listened to “This American 
Life” on my runs. Hundreds 
of miles logged have been 
matched with hundreds of 
stories from people all around 
the world.

My alarm clock blares before 

the crack of dawn, I climb out 
of bed, slip on my running 
shoes and walk out the front 
door. The air has the distinct 
smell of morning dew: clean 
and fresh. I press “play” on 
my podcast, and I’m off, legs 
running and feet pounding. 
Ira Glass’s friendly voice rings 
through my ears: “Every week 
on our podcast we choose a 
weekly theme…” This opening 
statement is one I can recite 
from 
memory, 
that 
makes 

me feel comfortable; it is like 
listening to an old friend.

One rainy morning, I turned 

on my daily podcast. I heard 
Ira’s weekly opening statement, 
his 
tone 
noticeably 
more 

somber than previous weeks. 
This, he said, was Harper High 
School. The “This American 
Life” staff would be spending 
two weeks in an inner-city 
Chicago high school exploring 
how the school deals with lack 
of funding, gang violence and 
the school-to-prison pipeline.

Jumping over puddles and 

getting more drenched by 
the minute, I remember tears 
streaming from my face and 
mixing with the dreary rain 
as I listened to the stories of 
the three students who were 
shot, the teachers who didn’t 
come to class and the weekly 
flooding of the hallways from 
dilapidated infrastructure.

Harper High School is a 

stark contrast to my high 
school, an upper-middle class 
suburban school where almost 
everyone graduates and goes to 
college. And this educational 
disparity made me angry. So 
I decided to act. I gathered 
the support of my peers and 
faculty and broke through a 
long-held silence surrounding 

systemic issues. Students for 
Social Justice emerged, and 
with the help of the school 
administration we launched a 

school-wide campaign 
against sexual assault. 
For the first time, and 
for the next two years 
of high school, I was 
able to be a leader and 
make a difference.

Arriving 
at 
the 

University of Michigan 
in early fall brought a 
mix of fear, excitement 
and anticipation. High 
school had supposedly 
“prepared” me for the 

next four years, and everyone 
said the best years of my life 
lay ahead. The first few weeks 
of college included thousands 
of new faces, taking the longest 
route to class because Google 

Maps did not know how to 
navigate through the Diag and 
working up the courage to do 
homework in the Law Library. 
All of these changes were new, 
and I felt like I was failing to 
find my place.

Festifall 
was 
the 
most 

overwhelming event to occur 
on 
campus: 
thousands 
of 

booths, flyers and, of course, 
free candy. I grabbed handfuls 
of flyers and laid them out 
on my still-organized desk. 
All the clubs seemed new, 
exciting 
and 
promising. 
I 

could help refugees, join a 
pre-law fraternity, cook in 
the South Quad basement or 
work for a handful of different 
publications.

I was a typical overly-

ambitious freshman, and all of 
those flyers sat in my desk for 
weeks. I would occasionally 
glance at them while getting 
my next stack of notecards, and 
a pang of anxiety would pass 
through my body. I had yet to 
attend any mass meetings or 
fill out any applications. Was 
I failing at getting involved? 
I felt like the only freshman 
on campus who was this 
overwhelmed, but I began to 
realize I was not alone.

As 
the 
semester 

progressed, 
my 
friends 

changed, 
my 
classes 
got 

more difficult and the leaves 
began to change colors. As I 
continued to doubt my college 
involvement, “This American 
Life” remained a constant. My 
running routes shifted from 
flat, tree-lined streets to the 
hills near Oxford Road. Ira 
Glass’s voice rang in my ears, 
sharing stories of failures, 
hope and the possibilities of 
change. Donald Trump had 
been in office for a year, but 
Roy Moore lost in Alabama. 
There was still hope, and 
I could make a difference. 
Hundreds 
of 
students 
on 

our 
own 
campus 
kneeled 

for hours in protest. Change 
could be made in any way. 
Making a difference did not 
have to mean joining clubs or 
starting political movements. 
Rather, it meant continuing 
to seek out experiences that 
made me feel empowered and 
showed me a purpose. Though 
not becoming involved in 
typical college organizations 
felt 
much 
like 
failure, 

recognizing my purpose from 
the environment in which 
I was immersed each day 
continued to be empowering.

My 
surroundings 
have 

shifted, 
but 
my 
curiosity 

and 
desire 
for 
progress 

has never waned. I see this 
possibility 
in 
the 
smallest 

of 
places: 
contributing 
to 

class discussion, reading the 
newspaper during a 30-minute 
break or discussing politics 
with 
a 
newfound 
friend. 

Recognizing my peers come 
from diverse places and have 
different experiences sparked 
my interest in asking questions. 
The transition from high school 
leadership 
to 
discovering 

interests in unknown places is a 
new experience. But sometimes 
experiencing the “new” is just 
opening your eyes to the world 
around you. All of this reminds 
me that I am no longer in my 
bubble: there is possibility all 
around me.

Now, I sit through lectures 

about the history of social 
justice 
and 
civil 
rights 

on 
college 
campuses. 
My 

professors are teaching my 
peers and me how to lead, 
pioneering 
generations 
of 

change. This is the kind of 
change that “This American 
Life” motivated me to think 
about. This is the change 
that I experience unknowing 
opportunities each day. So, “on 
this week of ‘This American 
Life,’” I will keep listening, 
keep asking questions and 
keep working for change.

Thursday, January 11, 2018 — 5

Across our many backgrounds, 
identities, opinions and values, 
there is one thing that every 
single college student can agree 
on: Freshman year is an absolute 
shitshow. You’ve never had 
this much freedom in your life, 
and at the tender age of 18, you 
really aren’t quite sure what to 
do with it. Sometimes the urge 
to do something undeniably 
stupid is so strong that it takes 
a few minutes to stop and think, 
“Hey, maybe I shouldn’t have a 
drunken, six-hour long Cards 
Against Humanity marathon on 
a Wednesday afternoon.” (Side 
note: If you do, please invite me). 
But alongside all of the stupid 
mistakes and lifelong memories 
of freshman year, there is a 
level of personal growth that is 
unmatched by any other time in 
your life. This is the time to make 
decisions and relationships that 
will define the rest of your time 
in college, and it’s as incredibly 
exciting as it is excruciatingly 
nerve-wracking.
Nothing else on television 
right now truly captures this 
moral mess that is the first year 
of college better than “Grown-
ish.” A spin-off of the popular 
ABC show “Black-ish,” “Grown-
ish” follows Zoey Johnson (Yara 
Shahidi, “The First Family”) as 
she gets started at university. 
Her stories are told from the 
future looking back, and the 
series 
premiere 
takes 
place 

mostly in a single classroom, 
with each main character telling 
their new classmates how they 
ended up there in a “Breakfast 
Club” style confessionary.
For badass Jewish feminist 
Nomi 
(Emily 
Arlook, 
“The 
Good Place”), it was because 
she missed registration while 
hooking up with a girl in the 
bathroom. Drug-dealing Vevek 
(Jordan Buhat) was too busy 
closing a sale with frat boys to 
register for classes. And Zoey? 
Well, Zoey ran away from 
registration after seeing her first 
college friend, who she had left 
in a pool of her own vomit at a 
“day party,” standing in line. 
Despite the questionable morals 

of the rest of the characters, 
Zoey’s response is the only 
one that draws any backlash, 
immediately signaling to both 
Zoey and the audience that 
this transition into college isn’t 
necessarily going to be a smooth 
one.
Despite the glaring plot hole 
that for some reason, in the 
21st century, these kids are 
registering for classes at some 
kind of office rather than at home 
on their computers, “Grown-
ish” is almost uncomfortably 

close to reality. As a freshman 
myself, watching the show felt 
like watching a professionally 
filmed recap of my first semester 
set to hip hop and synthesizers. 
The water-themed frat parties, 
the late-night pizza runs and, 
most importantly, the nagging 
realization that every decision 
you’re faced with is now yours 
and yours alone to make are 
pivotal aspects of the freshman 
experience. And Zoey, like the 
rest of us, is far from perfect 
when she deals with them.
It is this that makes “Grown-
ish” such an important show, 
especially 
for 
the 
younger 
audience that it targets. So many 
teenagers have an idealized 
version of college that they 
comb through over and over 
again in their minds before 
finally saying that last good bye 
to their parents and stepping 
foot on campus. More often than 
not, that picture-perfect fantasy 
world is shattered within the 
first week, and all that’s left is a 
scared kid who isn’t sure of who 
they really are, and certainly 
doesn’t know who they want to 
be.
“Grown-ish” shows us that 
it’s okay to not have everything 
figured out, and it’s okay to 
be 
lost, 
because 
even 
life 
on a television screen isn’t 
perfect. For the next four 
years, life is going to be a series 
of wrong choices and huge 
embarrassments, but through 
it all there will be someone 
coming out of every disappoint 
just a little bit more grown.

I recently participated in the 
University Jazz Lab Ensemble 
winter 
concert. 
While 
we 
mostly performed traditional 
big band charts on this concert, 
we also performed the vocal 
piece “Too Close For Comfort” 
from the 1956 musical “Mr. 
Wonderful.”
For about a month leading 
up to the concert, we rehearsed 
the piece without the vocalist. 
Though the name of the song 
seemed a little strange to me, 
I will admit that I gave it little 
thought.
The day before the concert, 
we had a dress rehearsal with 
the vocalist (and with proper 
amplification) 
at 
Rackham 
Auditorium. 
As 
the 
words 
to the piece began to be 
distinguishable, I was shocked 
at what I was hearing. With 
lyrics such as, “Be soft, be 
sweet, but be discreet / Don’t go 
off your beat,” and, “Be firm, be 
fair, be sure, beware / On your 
guard, take care, while there’s 
such temptation,” I began to 
question what exactly we were 
condoning in our performance 
of this piece. Was it about a 
non-consensual 
relationship? 
Was this song something that 
I was comfortable with? What 
did this song mean?
We had begun rehearsing this 
piece in mid-Oct., only weeks 
after The New York Times 
published their investigation of 
Harvey Weinstein. Al Franken 
announced 
his 
planned 
resignation from the Senate 
just hours before we rehearsed. 
It 
seemed 
impossible 
to 
understand this piece without 
thinking about the #MeToo 
movement. I could not help 
but 
consider 
the 
cultural 
implications of this piece; the 
deeper meaning behind the 
song.
To other members of the 
ensemble, however, this song 
was neither uncomfortable nor 
upsetting. At the ending of the 
song, the narrator continues 
to narrate thoughts about the 
woman without ever acting on 
them. “She’s much too close for 
comfort now / Too close, much 
too close / She’s much too close 
for comfort now,” and it ends. 
The fact that we had a female 
vocalist also seemed to make 
the song more appropriate 
to 
some 
members 
of 
the 
ensemble. To some, it was a 
relic of a bygone era — it had 
been premiered in 1956, and 
it thus represented the beliefs 
of that time period. While by 
our standards it may be wrong, 
they argued, it was permissible 
in that time period.
In Nov., I wrote a piece on 
William 
Bolcom’s 
“Dinner 
at Eight” and experienced a 
similar phenomenon — while 
trying to discuss the opera 
and the director’s thoughts 
about approaching the opera, 
our 
conversation 
almost 
inevitably turned to politics. 
This opera depicted upper 
class 
Manhattan 
socialites 
during the Great Depression. 
It emphasized the disconnect 
between this upper class and 
the lower and middle classes 
during this tumultuous time 

in American history. The opera 
was composed in 2008 in the 
midst of the Great Recession; 
it could not have been more 
relevant to modern events.
As I interviewed various 
members of this production, 
one thing was clear: Everyone 
had an idea of what this 
production 
meant. 
While 
they all agreed that the piece 
was about this upper class 
disconnect, every member of 
the 
production 
interpreted 

and 
applied 
this 
meaning 
differently. To some, it was 
a 
veiled 
criticism 
at 
the 
elitism of the upper classes, 
particularly 
the 
modern 
upper class opera audiences. 
To 
others, 
it 
emphasized 
the failures inherent to the 
human condition that occur 
irrespective of class. To still 
others, it exposed the attempts 
by the upper classes to hide 
their failings from the lower 
classes.
In 
our 
modern 
cultural 
environment, it seems as if 
all performance art is riddled 
with 
cultural, 
social 
and 
political implications. We are 
a country defined by red and 
blue, and it seems impossible 
for performance art to have 
no overt connections to one 
side of this divisive cultural 
landscape.
For performers, this can 
lead 
to 
over-analysis. 
If 
performance 
art 
cannot 
lack a worldly relevance, if 
performance 
art 
must 
be 
immediately relevant to one’s 
beliefs, then relevance must 
be found even where relevance 
doesn’t exist. The controversy 
over this summer’s “Julius 
Caesar” at New York City’s 
Shakespeare In The Park, for 
example, generated unexpected 
interest in the production. 
While the production itself 
was 
incredibly 
thought-
provoking, the references to 
the current political climate 
were 
successful, 
although 
slightly predictable, means of 
generating modern political 
controversy around an old 
classic as a means of garnering 
interest and attention.
For creators, this cultural 
divide has contributed to a 
modern art culture almost 
oppressively 
saturated 
in 
political subtexts. Art with 
political 
meaning 
is 
being 
created at an alarming rate, 
easily overshadowing almost 
all 
non-political 
art. 
The 
Golden 
Globes 
this 
past 
weekend, for example, were 
equally as focused on politics 
as they were on art. Almost all 
non-political statements at the 
award ceremony were ignored 
in favor of the many political 

statements made throughout. 
And 
while 
these 
political 
statements may be warranted, 
and they change that they 
are provoking may be viewed 
(by most people) as good, 
this glorification of political 
resistance slowly eats away at 
the core values shared by those 
on both sides of this cultural 
divide.
Performance art can and 
should be used to challenge 
beliefs and provoke thought 
— not merely to confirm one’s 
beliefs. 
Performance 
art 
can and should be used as a 
means of protest, not a means 
of glorifying the concept of 
protest 
and 
the 
rejection 
of commonality with one’s 
ideological enemies. Art is 
the vehicle that moves culture 
forward, 
that 
challenges 
unconscious 
biases 
within 
culture. Art is the means by 
which culture is forced to 
improve. Art is always a step 
ahead 
of 
culture, 
pulling 
culture towards this next step, 
towards a shared vision of a 
utopic future that both possess.
If anything, I fear that the 
current political climate is 
overwhelming 
art’s 
ability 
to provoke positive change. 
With so many disagreements 
between the political left and 
the political right, with so 
many fundamental differences 
between blue and red, with 
fundamental 
differences 
developing between liberals 
and conservatives over the very 
meaning of truth — art is being 
overwhelmed by the desire 
for political protest. With so 
many differing beliefs for both 
sides to challenge, art is being 
used to glorify the idea of 
challenging the other side, not 
the positive changes brought 
about by these challenges.
Performance art must avoid 
becoming obsessed with the 
elephant in the concert hall. 
This elephant can become all-
consuming 
and 
repressive. 
Just like members of the Jazz 
Lab Ensemble, I struggled to 
either condemn or condone 
“Too 
Close 
for 
Comfort.” 
Many concert-goers must now 
analyze the performance art 
they are viewing against this 
elephant in the concert hall, 
determining whether or not 
they support or denounce the 
art they are viewing.
Art should make one think. 
Whether it conforms to or 
challenges one’s understanding 
of the world, art should force 
a 
reevaluation 
of 
position; 
one’s inherent biases and one’s 
hidden beliefs. Art should be 
provocative, not reactionary. 
Art should challenge one’s 
own beliefs not the beliefs 
of the elephant in the room. 
Art should be used to bring 
people together, not divide 
them. The response to this 
elephant in the room should 
not be glorification of the 
criticism of others. As Leonard 
Bernstein said, the response 
to this elephant in the concert 
hall 
should 
be, 
“to 
make 
music more intensely, more 
beautifully, 
more 
devotedly 
than ever before.”

The elephant in the 
concert hall

Netflix’s ‘Bright’ is an 
off-balanced fantasy

“Bright” is a film directed by 
David Ayer (“Suicide Squad”) 
and written by Max Landis 
(“American 
Ultra”). 
Anyone 
who has seen the work of either 
of the two will surely have an 
idea of what they will get with 
“Bright.” “Suicide Squad” was 
one of the ugliest and worst 
shot movies of 2015. “Bright” 
easily takes the cake for 2017. 
Subtlety is neither the writer 
nor the director’s strong suit. 
A Netflix release, “Bright” hits 
the audience over the head so 
hard with its message that some 
might actually feel concussed 
after the watching the film. 
Thank heavens no one will 
ever have to see this on the big 
screen.
Will Smith (“Suicide Squad”) 
and Joel Edgerton (“Loving”) 
are two cops butting heads, but 
with a twist. Edgerton is an 
Orc. In the world of “Bright,” 
humans and elves fought side by 
side millennia ago against The 
Dark Lord and his army of Orcs. 
Ever since the humans won 
the final battle, Orcs have been 
seen as second-class citizens. 
“Bright” makes sure that the 
parallel between human/Orc 
tensions and racial tensions in 
the real world are as clear as 
possible, even if the analogy 
doesn’t hold up upon much 

thought. It’s a strange thing 
to compare racism in America 
to divisions between a fantasy 
society wherein the different 
citizenry groups are literally 
different species, leaving the 

movie filled with ambiguous 
metaphor that is at times clever 
and at other times horribly 
tone deaf (one example is an 
off handed mention that Orcs 
have terrible verticals, and thus 
are terrible at basketball). The 
social commentary is misguided 
and mishandled. 
The world set up in “Bright” 
is 
one 
that 
actually 
has 
potential, albeit for a different 
movie. A world where fantasy 
elements such as Orcs, elves and 
magic wands are treated with 
complete seriousness, and “The 
Lord of the Rings” is basically 
ancient history, is an interesting 
concept that is totally wasted 
on a generic buddy cop story. 
The way magic wands are 
treated like nuclear weapons, 
and the idea of a United States 
Magic Bureau are fun ideas, but 
nothing interesting is done with 
them.
To that end, “Bright” feels 
more like an extended TV pilot 
than it does a feature film. 
There are a multitude of side 
characters, 
shadowy 
figures 

and 
organizations 
that 
are 
given only lip service here, with 
the clear implication being that 
they will get more development 
in a sequel or sequels down the 
line. One wonders if it would’ve 
been more interesting to take 
this idea and turn it into a 
Netflix miniseries à la “Stranger 
Things” rather than a Netflix 
movie. “Bright” has gotten a 
lot of flack on the internet and 
has been labeled by some critics 
as the worst movie of the year. 
That’s hyperbole for what, at 
the end of the day, is really just a 
generic action movie with some 
fantasy elements thrown in, but 
it speaks to the growing critical 
internet subculture that either 
aggressively praises or skewers 
films completely, giving almost 
no room for middle ground.
“Bright” is bad. It is not 
abhorrently bad. It is not an 
affront to viewer’s intelligence 
or an insult to cinema. It is just 
a bad movie. The kind of bad 
movie that, given time, could 
find a future as some kind of cult 
classic. It’s weird, and it has got 
some interesting ideas floating 
around in it. The execution is 
pretty much a disaster across 
the board, but it is hard not to 
feel like there was something 
cool in there somewhere. If 
you look at “Bright” and squint 
really hard, you can almost 
see the blockbuster fantasy 
franchise Netflix is hoping to 
create. Almost.

What makes country 
music so uncool today? 

I’ve spent the better part 
of my adolescence trying to 
be cool. I’m not going to hide 
it; all I ever wanted to do was 
be a frontwoman and pull off 
Doc Martens without my legs 
looking like toothpicks about 
to break under my weight. 
There was a solid year where I 
carried around “Catcher in the 
Rye” without even reading it. 
I’ve watched “Almost Famous” 
close to 15 times. I have a dorm 
drawer overflowing with band 
t-shirts to not only prove how 
annoying I was as a middle 
schooler, but also my passion 
for the grit and glitter of rock. 
I don’t know if I ever actually 
became cool in the end, because 
I definitely am not now, but the 
constant avoidance of what I 
believed to be “uncool” helped 
me recognize a set of guilty 
pleasures I just couldn’t give 
up. Even though I’ve been a 
proud proponent of almost 
every genre from London grime 
to experimental jazz, there was 
a large hole in the public aspect 
of that pride.
Now, I have a confession to 
make: I like country music. 
This isn’t exactly a crazy 
revelation, but for people who 
know me (and my undying 

worship of Stevie Nicks), it may 
be. But it’s true — I not only 
like country, it honestly raised 
me. I can remember watching 
Shania Twain’s Up! tour DVD 
with my sister twice a day for 
years of my early childhood. 
Even though I barely remember 
it, my first concert at age six 
was the Dixie Chicks. I went 
home 
this 
Christmas 
and 
found a hilarious photo of my 
younger self, wearing my mom’s 
cowboy boots and a tied-up 
shirt, twirling around with my 
toy guitar. It made me think 
about how much I used to love 
country, singing with my family 
in the car to songs like “Cowboy 
Take Me Away” and feeling 
unbearably happy. 
This year, I’ve come back to 
country in some ways, letting 
it calm me down when I’m 
missing my mom or dancing 
like a crazy person when I need 
a little relief from the world. 
But it got me thinking: What 
really makes something cool 
or uncool? What’s wrong with 
badass women like Faith Hill 
singing about their experiences 
in love and life, pulling your 
heart 
out 
with 
songs 
like 
“Breathe”? Why can’t I scream 
Hunter Hayes’s “Crazy” at the 
top of my lungs on the freeway 
without weird glances from my 
hipster friends? Even beyond 
pure, commercialized country, 

people are still weird about 
music that even sounds similar, 
immediately 
disregarding 
genres like roots rock, bluegrass 
and folk because of country’s 
reputation.
Look, I can understand where 
people are coming from when 
they say they hate the genre 
in its entirety. There are an 
increasing amount of bad apples 
in country music — people who 
stick to the same routine of beer, 
red dirt and tan legs over and 
over again and love to throw 
in a gratuitous banjo once in 
a while to spice it up. They’ve 
lost the soul that makes music 
good, and essentially pander 
to their blue-collar audiences 
while wearing designer clothes 
and living in mansions. They’re 
why I stopped listening in the 
first place. However, if you take 
a second to think about it, every 
genre has people like this. The 
rise of almost machine-made 
popular music has made a lot 
of people angry in every sector 
of the business. All I’m saying 
is, don’t knock it ’til you try it. 
It’s easy to avoid entire genres 
without taking a closer look, 
but there’s often something 
awesome hidden within the 
ugly. For now, I’m going to stick 
with this pursuit of exploring 
the uncool, and who knows — 
maybe I’ll come out of it with 
some twang.

‘The Good Place’ is 
Schur’s best work yet 

Can Michael Schur do any 
wrong? 
From 
“The 
Office” 
to “Parks and Recreation” to 
“Brooklyn 
Nine-Nine,” 
his 
particular style of comedy sitcom 
manages to outclass nearly every 
other show of its genre, excelling 
at being optimistic but not 
sappy and featuring memorable 
ensemble casts. Yet somehow, 
even when compared to the 
legendary aforementioned shows, 
“The Good Place” may just be his 
best work of all.
“The Good Place” returned 
from its winter break with the 
episode “Leap of Faith,” in which 
Michael (Ted Danson, “Fargo”) 
faces an unexpected visit from 
the all-powerful judge of the 
afterlife, Shawn (Marc Evan 
Jackson, 
“22 
Jump 
Street”). 
However, he somehow manages 
to leave the meeting unscathed, 
actually in a better position than 
when he came in. Nonetheless, 
Shawn’s verdict renders Eleanor 
(Kristen Bell, “How to Be a Latin 
Lover”), Tahani (Jameela Jamil), 
Chidi (William Jackson Harper, 
“Paterson”) and Jason (Manny 
Jacinto, “The Romeo Section”) in 
a spot of bother.
And I’ll leave it at that. 
Seriously, there is no better way 
to go into any episode of this show 
than completely blind. Unlike 
most major network sitcoms, 
“The Good Place” is highly 
serialized, speeding through its 
plot at a breakneck pace. Lesser 
shows may stretch moments, 

such as a montage of Michael’s 
failures earlier in the season or 
the initial plot with Shawn into 
who-knows-how-many episodes, 
but as Schur proves repeatedly, 

this show does not play by any of 
our rules. The infamous twist at 
the end of season one lent itself to 
thousands of fan theories which 
Schur ripped apart and tore 
down in the space of one episode. 
Amazingly, even the simplest 
gags are present in the show’s 
premiere, such as “The Good 
Place” automatically replacing 
profanity with words like “fork” 
and “shirt.”
Like always, the characters of 
“The Good Place” are captivating 
and marvelously portrayed. It’s 
hard to see anyone but Danson 
convincingly play Michael, a 
character that can make anyone 
fall for his charm while being a 
literal personification for evil. 
Bell’s Eleanor is much more 
clever this season and the most 
perceptive of the bunch. Jason, 
the show’s “Andy Dwyer,” makes 
a character who on paper is 
rather annoying into (like Andy) 
one of the show’s most loveable 
characters — shame he couldn’t 
be alive to witness his beloved 
Jaguars have a winning season. 
Meanwhile 
Janet 
(D’Arcy 
Carden, “Crazy Ex Girlfriend”), 

the 
personified 
“foundational 
mainframe” of the afterlife is 
more advanced than ever and 
provides some of the show’s best 
gags. We see her vomit coins, play 
the role of a trophy wife and even 
feel jealousy, all while cheerfully 
reminding characters at every 
turn that she is not a human and 
doesn’t actually eat or feel or die.
Perhaps 
the 
biggest 
accomplishment of the show is the 
fact that it tackles and introduces 
important philosophical theories 
and works them into the show in 
such a light-hearted, accessible 
way. After all, though modern 
philosophy is still viewed as a 
detached, academic discipline, 
“The Good Place” reminds us 
that studying philosophy may 
actually be a worthwhile venture. 
In one of the best episodes of the 
season, Chidi (the resident moral 
philosophy 
professor) 
teaches 
Michael and the others about 
the infamous “Trolley Problem,” 
which 
Michael 
proceeds 
to 
simulate in graphic reality. In an 
effort to make Michael actually 
care about learning ethics, Chidi 
makes him come to grips with 
the fact that he too can actually 
die (although in a more gruesome 
manner 
ironically 
called 
“retirement”), causing Michael 
to spiral into an existential and, 
subsequently midlife, crisis.
The fact that Michael Schur 
has wrapped all of these strengths 
into a major network sitcom is a 
testament to his immense skill 
as a writer. Few shows on TV 
are as original, funny, thought-
provoking and deserving of more 
viewers as “The Good Place.”

Kelly’s ‘Matisse Drawings’ 
make midwestern stop 
at the UMMA’s exhibit

Today, 
American 
artist 
Ellsworth Kelly and Frenchman 
Henri Matisse are recognized as 
two of the most significant artists 
of the 20th century. Yet, their 
lifetimes overlapped for a mere 
21 years; Matisse was nearing 
the end of his life as Kelly was 
starting out as an artist. For the 
amateur Kelly, Matisse’s works 
served as artistic inspiration 
as he developed his presence 
and 
style. 
During 
Kelly’s 
international travels following 
World War II, as he discovered 
artists that inspired him, it 
was Matisse’s emboldened use 
of line that informed his own 
unique style of draftsmanship.
“Matisse 
Drawings,” 
an 
exhibition 
Kelly 
curated 
in 
2014 at Mount Holyoke College 
Art Museum, is an opportunity 
to “see Matisse through the 
eyes 
of 
Kelly,” 
said 
Lehti 
Keelmann, Assistant Curator of 
Western Art at the University of 
Michigan Museum of Art. Kelly 
chose 45 seldom-shown Matisse 
drawings, to each of which he 
felt personally connected, that 
represent the scope of Matisse’s 
career.
Kelly 
supplemented 
these 
works with nine of his own 
lithographic 
drawings 
that 
date from a trip to France in 
the 1960s when he studied 
Matisse’s expression of figure 
and nature through line. Kelly 
shared Matisse’s intention to 
translate — rather than copy — 
nature in his work. While Kelly 
crafted a crisp and controlled 
drawing 
style 
compared 
to 
Matisse’s expressive use of line, 
Kelly’s drawings reflect his 
aspiration to draw in the spirit 
of Matisse whom he believed 
“every mark on the page that he 
made had that sort of distinctive 
quality that spoke to the artist,” 

Keelmann said.
Keelmann 
took 
on 
the 
challenge of translating Kelly’s 
curatorial vision as managing 
curator of the UMMA’s showing 
of 
“Matisse 
Drawings,” 
on 
display until Feb. 18. The public 
is invited to view the exhibition 
during the UMMA’s business 
hours (11 a.m. to 5 p.m.), as well 

as the opportunity to engage in 
deeper learning of Matisse and 
Kelly at “happenings” hosted in 
the spirit of the exhibition. The 
museum has exciting offerings 
this MLK weekend.
On Friday, Jan. 12 at 5:30 
p.m., John Stomberg — who 
collaborated 
with 
Kelly 
to 
curate the original exhibition 
at Mount Holyoke — will speak 
on the process of working with 
Kelly and situate the creative 
evolution of each artist within 
their 
respective 
contextual 
circumstances. 
Additionally, 
on Sunday, Jan. 14, at 2:00 p.m., 
UMMA will offer a gallery talk 
and tour where attendees can 
look forward to an exercise 
in close looking. A docent’s 
guidance will provide a roadmap 
to navigating the exhibition 
that will facilitate intimate 
engagement with the works on 
display.
“Matisse 
Drawings” 
is 
a 
traveling 
exhibition, 
the 
UMMA hosting its midwestern 
destination. 
Detailed 
instructions 
specifying 
the 
construction and installation 
of the exhibition guided the 
UMMA’s curation of Kelly’s 
vision. The two artists’ works 
are shown in separate spaces 

conjoined by a vibrant blue 
alcove. In this way, the showing 
of 
Matisse’s 
and 
Kelly’s 
drawings 
can 
function 
as 
separate exhibitions.
This architecture, however, 
creates a passage between the 
two spaces that evinces the 
rapport between the two artists, 
and it offers a way to physically 
navigate the ways in which 
Matisse’s use of line informed 
Kelly’s development of his own 
drawing style. Furthermore, the 
vibrant blue passage encourages 
a 
consideration 
of 
line 
in 
correspondence to these artists’ 
use of color in their oeuvres.
Kelly specified the height at 
which works were hung and 
evenly spaced them throughout 
the exhibition. He also forwent 
the use of tombstones that 
would provide context of the 
Matisse 
works 
— 
although 
tombstones 
do 
accompany 
Kelly’s lithographic drawings. 
In this way, Kelly curated the 
space in order to encourage an 
immersive visual experience. 
This exhibition is about deep 
looking 
and 
engagement 
with the medium of drawing. 
Both Kelly and Matisse were 
recognized for their use of 
color in their art, but they were 
equally creative in their use of 
line, and line informed their use 
of color.
“(Kelly) 
was 
trying 
to 
showcase that, really, drawing 
was integral, if not foundational, 
for 
their 
artistic 
practice,” 
Keelmann said.
Everyone has a relationship 
to line. “We can all take a 
piece of paper out and doodle,” 
Keelmann pointed out. “Matisse 
Drawings” 
puts 
two 
great 
artists’ drawings on display, but 
it is also an ode to the artistic 
practice of drawing itself. This 
exhibition serves to consider the 
creative expression of drawing, 
to which anyone who has picked 
up a pencil can relate.

Increased freshmen roles raise Michigan’s ceiling
T

o Michigan coach 
John Beilein, it wasn’t 

so much a 
dismissive 
comment as 
it was the 
norm of life 
in college 
basketball.

In a close 

win over 
Central 
Michigan in 
November, 
Beilein’s three freshmen 
combined to play four scoreless 
minutes in the second half. 
Beilein uttered a platitude 
that seemed more apt to fit 
your father’s era of college 
basketball.

“I thought in the second half, 

we go down, it wasn’t a time for 
freshmen to be on the floor.”

That came against a Mid-

American Conference team 
that has since lost to Eastern 
Michigan and Kent State in 
back-to-back games. Trust is 
fickle, but rarely final.

Which underscores the 

importance of Beilein’s choice 
to go with three freshmen 
together — Eli Brooks, Jordan 
Poole and Isaiah Livers — 
Tuesday night, in the most 
consequential half of the 
Wolverines’ season to date. 
Checking in with 12:29 left in 
the game, Brooks and Poole 
joined Livers on the court, 
down four points to No. 5 
Purdue, with an upset win in 
the balance.

Now that’s trust. And it’s 

trust each has earned in the 
two months since the Chippwas 
came to town.

Poole was the highest 

recruit. Brooks earned a 
starting opportunity early in 
the season. Livers was perhaps 
the least likely of the three 
to make a major contribution 
this season. And yet, not only 
has Livers done just that, but 
coupling his emergence with an 

increased role might raise the 
team’s ceiling moreso than any 
other player.

With his play lately, it seems 

only a matter of time before 
Livers overtakes Robinson for 
the starting spot. And for good 
reason.

Livers has made 12 of his 

last 15 3-pointers, and while 
that 80-percent clip is clearly 
unsustainable, he doesn’t have 
to be an elite shooter to be a 
clear upgrade over Robinson 
— who’s still hovering around 
a career-low 36 percent from 
deep on the season. 

Tuesday, Livers’ defense 

on Purdue forward Vincent 
Edwards changed the game. 
Against Iowa, his physicality 
on forward Tyler Cook did 
the same. His offensive boon 
has merely been a bonus, but a 
bonus that does not appear to 
be a mirage.

“Duncan and Livers both 

could really play,” said Purdue 
guard Carsen Edwards. “But 
(Livers) is really athletic. I 
mean, he can move well. He 
matches up well with Vincent 
(Edwards).”

Added Beilein: “I think 

Isaiah is playing way above 
what I expected from two 
months ago. He couldn’t figure 
out what was going on on 
defense. I thought between him 
and Edwards, that was a great 
duel between a senior and a 
freshman.”

With Michigan clinging to 

a 67-66 lead with just under 
three minutes left, Livers 
caught the ball on the wing. 
Purdue forward Matt Haarms, 
adjusting to Livers’ newfound 
shooting stroke, closed out 
quickly on the freshman, who 
calmly gave a head fake and 
dribbled past Haarms, used his 
athleticism to finesse past the 
help defender, and laid the ball 
in over the 7-foot-3 Haarms’ 
outstretched arms.

It’s a play Livers wouldn’t 

have made a week ago, much 

less a month ago.

Elsewhere on the wing, 

there aren’t many minutes to 
pry from redshirt sophomore 
Charles Matthews and senior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman, but 
Jordan Poole is 
making Beilein 
try to find some 
anyway.

Poole has 

flashed the 
substance 
to match his 
trademark 
flair, adding 
an energetic 
dynamic to the 
team each time he steps on the 
court. Poole has garnered a 
reputation for his inclination 
to shoot any time, from 
anywhere, but he has actually 
been an efficient scorer in his 
fluctuating minutes.

After Tuesday’s eight-point 

performance on just four shots, 
Poole is now shooting close 
to 50 percent from the field, 
including a 42-percent clip from 
deep. More impressively, Poole 

scores a team-
high 0.64 points 
per minute on 
the floor.

He entered 

the game in 
the first half 
Tuesday with 
Michigan 
trailing by 10 
and immediately 
banked in a 
three-pointer. 

The new fan favorite jogged 
down the court with a smirk 
and shrug. But spurred by 
their defense, he and Livers 
ignited a quick 14-2 run to 
pull the Wolverines out of the 
deficit. When Poole exited the 

game five minutes later, the 
Boilermakers’ lead was down to 
just three.

With time winding down in 

the second half, Beilein even 
considered playing Abdur-
Rahkman at point guard — a 
move he has not made all 
season — just to fit Poole on the 
court in crunch time.

“(The moment) certainly 

isn’t (too big) for Jordan Poole,” 
Beilein said. “He wants it. 
We’ve got to continue to find 
ways to get him on the floor. I 
was actually thinking of — until 
(sophomore point guard Zavier 
Simpson) hit those two threes 
— to let Muhammad (Ali Abdur-
Rahkman) run the point. But all 
of a sudden (Simpson) hits the 
two threes.”

That’s certainly a long 

way from the “DNPs” he was 
collecting mere months ago.

Brooks’ role has diminished 

recently, which may have 
more to do with the growth 
of Simpson than any fault to 
Brooks. The freshman still 
holds down the backup point 
guard minutes ahead of fifth-
year senior Jaaron Simmons, 
which says plenty about the 
young guard’s maturity and 
ability.

A far cry from precluding 

freshmen from playing in 
the second half, Beilein is 
now finding as many ways as 
possible to utilize his first-year 
players.

It’s proof that, as Beilein said, 

the moment is no longer too big 
for the freshmen. 

As a result, their best 

moments might just be in front 
of them.

Freshman forward Isaiah Livers (#4) and freshman guard Jordan Poole (#2) have proven that late-game moments aren’t too big for them any longer.

“(The moment) 
certainly isn’t 
(too big) for 

Jordan Poole.”

AMELIA CACCHIONE/Daily

Freshman defenseman Quinn Hughes believes that Michigan has improved defensively thanks to growing familiarity with the system of coach Mel Pearson. 

Wolverines improving defense with Hughes back and Lavigne emerging

After two straight defeats 

against Notre Dame, things seem 
to be looking up for the Michigan 
hockey team.

It’s a strange statement to 

make, for obvious reasons. But 
in 2-1 defeats to the Fighting 
Irish Friday and Sunday, the 
Wolverines didn’t just hold their 
own. For substantial stretches, 
they 
actually 
outplayed 
the 

second-best team in the nation.

That, in itself, might constitute 

a moral victory, no matter how 
nebulous that concept is. But 
that’s not the most encouraging 
takeaway from last weekend — 
it’s how Michigan was able to 
obtain such a “victory.”

The 
Wolverines 
did 
it 

primarily with defense, a major 
change from the season’s first few 
months. For the first time since 
November, they held an opponent 

to two goals or less in consecutive 
games.

To 
Michigan 
coach 
Mel 

Pearson and his players, it’s the 
product of steady improvement 
and growing familiarity with the 
defensive system.

“We did a good job managing 

the puck for the 
most part, playing 
in 
the 
other 

team’s zone more 
and not giving up 
as many grade-A 
scoring chances,” 
Pearson 
said 

Tuesday 
about 

Sunday’s 
game. 

“It’s 
a 
team 

effort there, not 
just the goalies 
or defensemen, but I see a lot of 
improvement in a lot of areas.”

Added freshman defenseman 

Quinn Hughes: “It was a weird 
start to the year because no one 
really knew Mel or the coaching 

staff that well. I think sometimes 
with defensive stuff like that it 
just takes time.”

Hughes, in fact, is one of the 

best examples of that. The highly-
touted 
freshman 
joined 
the 

Wolverines more known for his 
dynamic skating and playmaking. 

Unproven, 
however, was his 
ability to be an 
elite 
defensive 

presence as well, 
especially 
given 

his small stature 
— 
Hughes 
is 

officially listed at 
just 5-foot-10 and 
175 pounds.

“At 
the 
end 

of the day I’m a 

defenseman too so I got to play 
good defense, especially at the 
next level,” Hughes said. “If you 
can’t do both, coaches can’t trust 
you out there.”

Added Pearson: “That’s his 

biggest question mark, what 
people are going to question. ... 
Can he play defense at the highest 
level? We talk about that all the 
time.”

But over the course of the 

season, Hughes, like the rest of 
his unit, has improved on the 
defensive 
end, 

succeeding with 
solid positioning 
and 
instincts, 

while 
learning 

when to attack 
and when to stay 
back.

These 

improvements 
were 
clear 

Sunday. 
Just 

two days after 
returning from playing for the 
United States at the World Junior 
Championships, Hughes — who 
ranks third on the Wolverines 
with 
nine 
assists 
— 
found 

fellow freshman Josh Norris for 

Michigan’s lone goal.

This, 
combined 
with 
his 

defensive performance, formed 
what Pearson called “one of the 
best skating games I’ve seen 
(Hughes) have at Michigan.” 
This speaks volumes to the 
progress that Hughes has made, 

considering 
Pearson’s 
uttered a similar 
statement at least 
twice previously.

“He’s 
maybe 

not the biggest 
guy, but he’s very 
smart, very rarely 
puts himself in 
a 
bad 
position 

defensively,” 
Pearson 
said. 

“He’s going to take some chances, 
but the risk/reward — you have 
to have a player like that do what 
he’s capable of doing. We just 
tell him to pick his spots. That’s 
the biggest thing. Just pick your 
spots, understand the game, 
manage the game, when to try to 
make something happen.”

But Hughes hasn’t been the 

sole savior for Michigan’s defense 
— it’s been a team production. For 
one, the Wolverines, after over 
three months, appear to have 
finally found a go-to goaltender.

Sophomore Hayden Lavigne 

has started Michigan’s last three 
games, 
allowing 
an 
average 

of 2.67 goals and posting a 
.937 save percentage — both 
major improvements over the 
Wolverines’ season totals.

Not only has Lavigne given 

Michigan 
its 
most 
reliable 

goaltending of the season, but 
the five players in front of him 
are also finding their stride at 
the same time. Working ahead 
with one goaltender, in contrast 
to a nightly rotation between 
Lavigne and sophomore Jack 
LaFontaine, has the potential to 
boost the confidence of the other 
Wolverines on the ice, and allow 
their offense to open up and take 
more chances.

“If you’ve got a goalie back 

there that you trust and know 
is going to make a majority of 

the saves, that can really help,” 
Pearson said. “You play a little bit 
looser, you’re not as uptight. That 
can give your team confidence 
and that’s what we’re looking for 
from Hayden.”

Added 
senior 
defenseman 

Sam Piazza: “It’s nice to have a 
confident goalie and I think it’s 
really important for success. You 
need a good goalie if we’re going 
to make any type of run, so it’s 
nice to see Hayden heating up 
and hopefully we can score some 
goals for him.”

Meanwhile, senior defenseman 

Cutler Martin’s return from an 
upper-body injury has continued 
to pay huge dividends. While 
having Martin’s leadership and 
physicality, 
accompanied 
by 

the threat he poses offensively 
from the point, is a boon in and 
of itself, Pearson pointed to the 
competition 
Martin’s 
return 

has necessitated. Sunday, with 
Hughes back in the lineup after 
international play, sophomore 
Griffin Luce found himself the 
odd man out of a now seven-deep 
defensive rotation, but that could 
easily change this weekend.

“Getting Cutler Martin back 

really helped,” Pearson said. 
“It’s given us another option and 
forced some competition back 
there and competition is good. 
That’s one way to get players’ 
attention. All of a sudden you’re 
out the lineup and they pay a 
lot more attention to what they 
should be doing.”

For all of these reasons and 

more, the Wolverines were able 
to hang with the Fighting Irish 
— and most promisingly, it wasn’t 
simply thanks to the second-
highest scoring offense in the Big 
Ten.

As encouraging as this may be, 

however, Michigan will need to 
start consistently winning games 
against high-caliber opponents 
if it is to make a run that would 
vault it into NCAA Tournament 
contention.

But the ingredients to do so, 

especially on defense, are there. 
Just a week ago, that wasn’t as 
clear.

Despite being swept, Michigan seems to have the ingredients to eventually be able to beat elite teams

“We did a good 
job managing 
the puck for the 

most part.”

“It’s nice 
to have a 
confident 
goalie.”


At some point for Zavier 

Simpson, something clicked.

It could have been before 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team took on UCLA, when 
Simpson’s 
defense 
against 

Bruins guard Aaron Holiday 
earned 
him 
extra 
minutes. 

He took advantage by adding 
a career-high 15 points in the 
comeback win.

Simpson matched that total 

against Iowa last week, and it 
got him the starting spot that 
he’d lost after a lackluster start 
to the season.

On Tuesday, against No. 5 

Purdue, Simpson dropped 15 
points again in a last-minute, 
one-point loss. And it was the 
manner 
in 
which 
Simpson 

scored those points that was 
most impressive.

With 
5:34 
left 
and 
the 

Wolverines down by three, 
junior forward Moritz Wagner 
corralled an offensive rebound 
off a missed free throw. He 
kicked it out to Simpson, who 
calmly waved Wagner over to 
set a screen. When Wagner did 

set the screen, Simpson dribbled 
to his right, drawing 7-foot-
2 Boilermaker center Isaac 
Haas 
— 
who 

was 
guarding 

Wagner 
— 
to 

pick him up.

A few passes 

later, 
Simpson 

had 
the 
ball 

again with the 
towering 
Haas 

guarding 
him. 

Simpson 
eyed 

him, 
rose 
up 

and 
drilled 
a 

3-pointer.

Tie game.
A little under a minute later, 

with the score still tied, senior 
guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman drove into the lane 
and kicked it out to Simpson, 
who was deep behind the 
3-point line. The sophomore 
calmly rose up again and hit 
another.

They were clutch shots that 

you might expect to come from 
Wagner or redshirt sophomore 
guard Charles Matthews, but 
maybe not Simpson. Yet, with 
the improvements Simpson has 
made in his offensive game, and 

the control he’s beginning to 
take over his position, the shots 
shouldn’t come as a surprise.

“Every 
day 

he’s learning he 
needs to evolve 
as a player, and 
he’s doing that,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach 
John 

Beilein. “I like 
how 
receptive 

he is to it, but 
he’s never gonna 
give 
in. 
He’s 

gonna be more 

hardworking than anyone we 
have. And it paid off a little bit 
tonight.”

At the beginning of the 

season, 
Simpson 
struggled. 

After a game against Southern 
Mississippi where he was held 
scoreless with only one assist 
in 22 minutes, his minutes were 
severely 
chopped. 
Simpson 

started the next game against 
LSU, but he played just 10 
minutes and again had 0 points.

Meanwhile, 
freshman 
Eli 

Brooks began to look more and 
more comfortable. He took 
Simpson’s starting spot just 
five games into the season, and 

it wasn’t until recently that 
Simpson took it back.

But now Simpson’s beginning 

to 
command 

respect. 
His 
3-point 

percentage 
of 43.3 is the 
second-highest 
mark 
for 
the 

Wolverines, and 
his 
5.7 
points 

per 
game 
are 

a 
respectable 

sixth-best 
on 

a 
team 
that 

has plenty of other offensive 
options.

“He’s just learning right 

now how you play at this 

level as far as a big-time high 
school player (who) really had 
success and all those things,” 

Beilein 
said. 

“But 
just 
like 

when 
you 
go 

to 
the 
pros, 

there’s a whole 
other 
level 
of 

understanding 
of the game.”

With all that 

being 
said, 

Simpson 
will 

likely never be a 
go-to 
offensive 

player. But nobody’s asking him 
to be. Michigan just needs some 
sort of offensive threat from its 
point guard position in order to 

have a well-rounded offense.

That could mean hitting 

a 
tough 
layup 
in 
traffic, 

like he did in the first half 
against Purdue. It could mean 
distributing and protecting the 
ball — Simpson’s 2.77 assist-to-
turnover ratio ranks him 39th 
among all NCAA Division 1 
players.

Or, it could mean a clutch 

3-pointer when his team needs 
it most.

Tuesday’s game may not be 

enough to prove that Simpson 
can be that kind of point 
guard all season, but if his 
recent performances are any 
indication, he may be as sure a 
bet as the Wolverines have.

HAILEY’S COMET

It was just another inbounds 

pass after just another shot during 
just another game.

Senior forward Jillian Dunston 

to senior guard Katelynn Flaherty, 
like always, towards the end of the 
third quarter as Michigan held 
onto a one-point lead.

Except for one twist: on this 

inbounds 
pass, 
Flaherty 
was 

knocked down by the player 
defending her, falling to the ground 
as Dunston tossed the easiest pass 
in basketball out of bounds. It 
was a crescendo of frustration in 
a game that seemingly featured 
nothing but.

Still, the No. 23 Michigan 

women’s basketball team (3-2 Big 
Ten, 14-4 overall) escaped Crisler 
Center with an 84-79 win over 
Indiana (1-4, 8-10) on Wednesday 
night — a victory the Wolverines 
didn’t especially deserve and 
shouldn’t be especially happy 
about.

Michigan came into the fourth 

quarter down by one and came all 
too close to finishing behind an 
inferior Hoosier squad.

The two teams went back and 

forth to start the final quarter, 
trading baskets until the 7:07 
mark. That was when — after 
grabbing 
her 
own 
offensive 

rebound — junior forward Nicole 
Munger drew a foul on a putback 
attempt, the fifth on Indiana’s 
Amanda Cahill. Cahill hadn’t just 
been providing an offensive spark 
— 16 points on 7-of-9 shooting 
— she was also one of the few 
Hoosiers able to compete with the 
Wolverines on the glass. Without 
her, a major advantage turned 
into a area of utter dominance 
for Michigan, which finished the 
contest with a 38-18 rebounding 
advantage, including six in a row 
to end it.

Munger hit both free throws 

to tie the game at 61 and, without 
Cahill, the game’s complexion 
changed. Though Indiana took 

the lead its next time down, the 
Wolverines grabbed it right back 
off a Munger 3-pointer that fell 
through the basket after two 
offensive 
rebounds 
extended 

the possession. Next time down, 
junior center Hallie Thome found 
Dunston out of a double-team in 
the post, who promptly swung 
it to freshman forward Hailey 
Brown in the corner for another 
triple.

Michigan wasn’t out of the 

mud, yet though. The Hoosiers led 
the Wolverines with as few as four 
minutes to go in the game after a 
Buss layup gave Indiana a 71-69 
lead.

With Indiana face-guarding 

Flaherty 
— 
a 
now-common 

deterrent to the program’s all-
time leading scorer — and double-
teaming Thome in the post, the 
Wolverines turned to Brown.

She delivered, nailing an elbow 

jumper off the catch to tie it at 71 
for her 22nd and 23rd points of the 
night, a career-high.

At that point, it was Flaherty’s 

turn to get in on the action, 
drawing a foul in transition and 
hitting both free throws. The 
Hoosiers didn’t hold another lead 
the rest of the way.

Make no mistake, however, 

Michigan got away with one. The 
Wolverines turned the ball over 
22 times, their highest mark since 
November, while coughing up 
over 75 points for the third time in 
four games. 

“I just think we weren’t locked 

in and focused,” Munger said. “...
Ohio State, we came out extremely 
locked in and extremely focused, 
and I think we just need to do a 
better job of taking that next step 
and being mature — like a mature 
team — and taking every scout 
and knowing every scout like 
completely.”

Barnes Arico touched on the 

seeming lack of preparedness 
as well, attributing it to a tightly 
packed schedule.

“We played (last) Thursday — so 

we traveled Thursday — we played 

Sunday, we played Wednesday, we 
play Saturday, we play Tuesday,” 
she said. “Count those days and 
count how many games and travel 
— three of those on the road — that 
(isn’t) that much time.

“Not a lot of time to practice, not 

a ton of time to prepare. Trying to 
figure out the fine line between 
rest and preparation. And using 
our experience to make sure we’re 
prepared and following the scout 
instead of reps. And tonight, I 
didn’t think we did a great job of 
that and I even called our older 
kids out on that. ‘Hey, we gave you 
a day to rest your legs, but then 
you gotta follow the scout. Or else 
we’re gonna practice.’ ”

One thing is clear: Michigan 

can’t deliver a similar performance 
again and expect to get away with 
it consistently. The Wolverines are 
about to embark on a two-game 
road trip, facing a solid Nebraska 
team and Ohio State, a top-10 
program that beat Michigan in 
Ann Arbor on Sunday.

Simply, if the Wolverines play 

like they did Wednesday, they’ll 
return home under .500 in Big Ten 
play.

Freshman Hailey Brown gets career-high 23 points

Following 
an 
exhilarating 

overtime loss to then-No.10 
Ohio State, the No. 23 Michigan 
women’s basketball team looked 
to clinch a routine win against 
Indiana Wednesday night.

But there was nothing routine 

about it.

With under four minutes 

remaining in a tied game, senior 
guard Katelynn Flaherty passed 
the ball to freshman forward 
Hailey Brown, who nailed an 
elbow jumper to give her team 
the lead.

The Wolverines went on to 

win, 84-79, at Crisler Center, 
but it didn’t come the way they 
expected. The team’s stars — 
Flaherty and junior center Hallie 
Thome — were closely guarded 
from the start and struggled 
to score early on. Meanwhile, 
Michigan’s 
defense 
couldn’t 

seem to limit the Hoosiers, 
causing a close game.

But two of the Wolverines’ 

three freshmen — Brown and 
guard Deja Church — stepped up, 

leading the team to victory on a 
night that reeked of upset.

Brown started hot, accounting 

for eight of Michigan’s first 10 
points. She went on to finish with 
a career-high 23 points, while 
grabbing eight rebounds. It was 
a special night for the Canada-
native.

“It felt good,” Brown said. “It 

was different cause a lot of people 
were asking if I was in my zone, 
but every shot just felt good. I 
guess once you start hitting them 
you become more confident.”

Added Michigan coach Kim 

Barnes Arico: “I thought Hailey 
was terrific. … It’s incredible 
when you have different people 
step up.”

Church’s contributions were 

also impressive. Though she 
finished with just nine points, a 
few of her baskets helped prevent 
the Wolverines from falling 
behind early.

The 
contributions 
from 

these two freshmen couldn’t 
have come at a better time, as 
Michigan looked out of sync 
from the beginning of a contest it 
couldn’t afford to lose.

But 
Brown’s 
stellar 

performance 
along 
with 

Church’s 
contributions 
gave 

Michigan the spark it needed, 
creating breathing room for 
others in the process.

The 
duo’s 
success 
shows 

how much they have grown 
throughout the season. Though 
Church is a reserve, she has 
already established herself as the 
first player to come off the bench 
and receives significant playing 
time. Whenever the Wolverines 
find themselves in a slump, they 
look to her to energize the team 
with her quick, confident style of 
play.

“Deja Church is key for us,” 

Barnes Arico said. “She runs our 
team. She is a good defender, 
she’s the fastest kid we have on 
our team, so she provides a lot 
of things for us and tonight we 
saw her again getting better 
and better. I think as the season 
progresses, she’s gonna be a 
kid that just improves the more 
experience she gets and the more 
the basketball is in her hand. But 
she’s a sponge — she’s willing to 
learn and she really contributed 
great minutes to us tonight.”

Brown, on the other hand, has 

started every game this season, 
and her improvements have been 
crucial to her team’s success. 
In her first game for Michigan 
— against George Mason back 
in early November — she went 
2-for-11 from the field to finish 
with just four points. But she 
improved week by week, and 
Wednesday she thrived, going 
10-for-12. Her confident shooting 
made the difference.

“(Brown) missed like two 

shots all night,” said junior guard 
Nicole Munger. “You can’t guard 
that. You can’t guard that at all.”

Though the Wolverines faced 

problems against Indiana, the 
quality play from the freshmen 
saved them from a potentially 
devastating defeat, while also 
providing a promising glimpse 
into the future.
