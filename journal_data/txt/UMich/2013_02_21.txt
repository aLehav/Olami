RESEARCH
Researchers
'find water in
, 1960s moon
samples


BARKING MAD


Finding at odds
with previous
moon theories
By DANIELLE
RAYKHINSHTEYN
Daily Staff Reporter
Your impression of the moon
might just be a mirage.
Geology Prof. Youxue Zhang
is part of a research team that
recently discovered plagioclase
mineral moon rocks that con-
tain up to six parts per million
of water - a finding that could
have much larger implications.
"By the nature of the min-
eral, it should not even have the
very low water concentration,"
Zhangsaid.
Zhang and his team have
been studying plagioclase from
the moon's crust obtained
during the Apollo missions
between 1961 and 1972. These
rocks would have been part of
the Genesis region of the moon.
The finding is important
because, according to the cur-
rent theory of moon formation
- giant impact theory - the
moon formed when hot mete-
ors collided with Earth, form-

ing an ocean of molten lava that
cooled to form the moon. Zhang
said all water should have been
lost in this process.
"Now, when we've found so
much water in the great early
moon, it's difficult to reconcile
with the giant impact hypoth-
esis," he said.
The first detection of water
on the moon occurred in 2008,
but that water was contained in
more recent moon rocks, and
could have been contaminated
by other factors like meteorites
and comets.
"Just in the last couple years
we have been working on this,"
Zhang said. "It's one surprise
after another. It's just very
exciting,"
Hejiu Hui, postdoctoral
research associate at the Uni-
versity of Notre Dame, was the
member of the research team
who pushed for the project. Hui
received his Ph.D. under Zhang
at Michigan.
Hui said it has taken a long
time to make this discovery
because there was no obvious
evidence of any water during
the Apollo missions.
"Through the Apollo mis-
sions, people didn't see any liq-

NIPR host takes on race

Norris heads
project to spark
conversation
By STEPHANIE SHENOUDA
Daily StaffReporter
Inspired by author Ernest
Hemingway, who felt any story
could be told in six words,

National Public Radio host
Michele Norris created the Race
Card Project to get people talk-
ing about the subject of race and
expressing their thoughts in a
single, six-word sentence.
After Norris mentioned the
project in her Martin Luther
King Jr. convocation speech
last year, the University asked
Norris to bring the project to
campus. As part of the theme

semester, "Understanding
Race," University members con-
tinue to submit cards online to
the University's contribution to
the project.
Norris said in an interview
with the Daily that she was
inspired to create a race-orient-
ed project after examining the
theme in her family history.
"I wrote a book in 2011, and it
was about my family history and

the secrets that the people who
raised me kept," Norris said. "I
knew from then on I would be
engaged in a conversation about
race, but I thought combining
my personal experiences with
other people's would be differ-
ent."
The race cards were initially
intended to be a "vehicle" for
getting people to talk, but they

FriendsLearn sees
value merging games
and education
By STEVEN YENG
Daily StaffReporter
A group of University stu-
dents and an alum have devel-
oped a unique way to combat
social problems. FriendsLearn,
a startup company based in Sili-
con Valley aims to use a game to
educate people on global issues.
Friendslearn was founded by
Bhargav Sri Prakash, an engi-
neer who earned his master's
degree in automotive engineer-
ing from the University in 2000.
Engineering juniors Andy Lee
and Josh Kim joined the compa-
ny after encountering Prakash
at the University's 2011 Startup
Weekend. Lee and Kim now
serve as the director of tech-
nology and creative director of
FriendsLearn, respectively.
"We went there with our own
idea, but our pitch was declined
... and Bhargav pitched his idea

and said he was going to merge
games with education, and we
thought 'Wow, what a great
idea."' Lee said.
After hearing Prakash's pitch,
Lee and Kim came up with the
concept of Fooya that weekend.
Fooya, a third-person shooter
game in which the players use
food as weapons, aims to edu-
cate players on obesity and the
global-health crisis.
"At (MPowered) startup
weekend, we had two topics in
our head: education and gam-
ing. So we thought, 'Why don't
we combine something that we
all like?' For example, food and.
gaming, how can we possibly
put them together and make it
fun, and people can play it and
get something out of it?" Kim
said.
The pair found a way to con-
nect the areas of interest, and
their pitch for Fooya earned
third place at Startup Weekend
2011.
"After the competition, Bhar-
gav called us again a couple of
months later and asked us if we

A woman charged with killing
her lover testified Wednesday that
she has no recollection of stabbing
him, slitting his throat or even
whether she shot him during a
fight at his Arizona home nearly
five years ago.
Jodi Arias, 32, has spent eight
daysonthewitness stand recount-
ing in precise detail one life event
after another - from an abusive
childhood to dead-end jobs and
ex-boyfriends - but when pressed
Wednesday about how she killed
Travis Alexander, she drew a
blank, noting there was a "huge
gap" in her memory from that day
in June 2008.
Arias spent the rest of the day
explaining to jurors why she
repeatedly lied about her involve-
ment in the killing, first telling
authorities she knew nothing
about Alexander's death, then
later blamingit on masked intrud-
ers. She eventually settled on self-

defense.

Diplomats troubled over
Iranian installation

Nations question
Iran's motive to
increase supply of
enriched uranium
(AP) - In a dishearten-
ing signal to world powers at
upcoming Iran talks, Tehran
has started installing high-tech
machines at its main uranium
enrichment site that are capa-
ble of accelerating production
of reactor fuel and - with fur-
ther upgrading - the core of
nuclear warheads, diplomats
said Wednesday.
Iran already announced last
week that it had begun mount-
ing the new enriching centri-
fuges, but one diplomat said at
the time that the announce-
ment was premature with only
a "small number" on site and
not yet installed.
Diplomats told The Associ-
ated Press on Wednesday, how-
ever, that installation was now
well on its way, with inspec-
tors from the International
Atomic Energy Agency seeing
close to 100 or more machines
mounted when they toured the
site a few days ago. Depending
on experts' estimates, the new-
generation centrifuges can
enrich uranium three to five
times faster than Iran's present
working model.
The Islamic Republic insists
it is not working on a nuclear
weapons program, but rather
is enriching uranium only to
make reactor fuel and for scien-
tific and medical purposes - as
allowed by international law.
But many nations are sus-
picious because Iran went
underground after failing to

get international help for its
uranium enrichment pro-
gram in the 1980s, working
secretly until its activities were
revealed a decade ago. More
recent proposals for interna-
tional shipments of reactor fuel
in exchange for Iranian enrich-
ment concessions have foun-
dered, with each side blaming
the other.
Shrugging off demands to
mothball enrichment - and
growing international sanc-
tions - Iran has instead vast-
ly expanded the program to
where experts say it already has
enough enriched uranium for
several weapons if the material
is further enriched.
The start of the centrifuge
upgrade at Natanz, Iran's main
enrichment site southeast of
Tehran, flies in the face of
world-power efforts to induce
Iran to scale back on enrich-
ment. As such, it is likely to hurt
chances of progress at Feb. 26
talks in Kazakhstan between
the two sides - adding to a
string of negotiating failures.
When Iran announced its
intentions last month, West-
ern diplomats downplayed the
proclamation's significance,
noting Tehran did not say
when it would start populating
Natanz with the new machines.
But any start of an upgrade is
sure to increase international
concerns, particularly if veri-
fied as expected in an IAEA
report later this week.
The three diplomats speaking
to the AP on Wednesday all are
involved in the Vienna-based
IAEA's attempts to monitor
Iran's nuclear program. They
demanded anonymity because
they were not allowed to discuss
confidential information.

Meeting Iran in Kazakhstan
are the United States, Russia,
China, Britain, France and Ger-
many.
Russia and China often are
at odds with the West on how
harshly Iran's nuclear activi-
ties should be censured, and
Russian Foreign Minister Ser-
gei Lavrov said recently that
Iran was within its legal rights
to install new generation cen-
trifuges. At the same time, he
called for a suspension of ura-
nium enrichment during nego-
tiations to improve the political
atmosphere.
While moving to increase
the potency of its enrichment
program with the new centri-
fuges, however, Tehran also
has recently resumed convert-
ing some of its higher-level
enriched uranium at its Fordo
enrichment site into reactor
fuel plates after suspending the
activity last year. That is likely
to provide some reassurance to
nations concerned about Iran's
nuclear aims because the plates
are difficult to reconvert back
into weapons usable material.
About 700 of the old machines
at Fordo are churning out high-
er-enriched material that is still
below - but just a technical step
away - from weapons-grade
uranium. Iran says it needs that
higher-enriched level to fuel a
research reactor.
With higher-enriched ura-
nium their immediate concern,
the six powers over the past
months have inched toward
meeting Iranian demands of
sanctions relief but say Teh-
ran must first suspend its
output at Fordo. Iran, in turn,
wants sanctions eased before it
commits to even a discussion of
an enrichment cutback.

Racism in disguise
Abolish offensive American Indian mascots locally
n Feb. 14, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights filed a
complaint with the U.S. Department of Education calling
for an end of the continued use of American Indian mas-
cots, slogans and imagery in 35 public schools across the state of
Michigan. The MDCR cites new evidence revealing the negative
effects on the learning environments of students as the reason for
requesting federal intervention against these schools. Although
intentions of the MDCR are correct, bringing in the federal govern-
ment is an overreach. This issue should be dealt with at the commu-
nal level to ensure that the education of students, who had no role
in choosing which mascot their school uses, is not held in jeopardy.

From team names like the Redskins to the
Indians, the continued use of American Indi-
an imagery in athletics is racist. Elementary
and secondary public schools shouldn't be
purveyors of racism. Evidence suggests that
mascots like these can ostracize American
Indian students, making them feel uncom-
fortable in their own school. Furthermore,
these symbols perpetuate stereotypes, which
can to impact academic performance. Com-
pared to the larger and more egregious mani-
festations of racism throughout the world,
these problems may seem small, but this is no
reason for inaction.
However, at the heart of this issue are indi-
vidual communities, and therefore, a solution
should come from the local level. The MDCR
included Chippewa valley High School as
one of the schools who use Native American
symbols, requesting they lose federal funding
if they don't change their mascot. However,
in 2008, the school's mascot, Big Red, was
changed from an American Indian's profile to
a red bird. This is just one example of Michi-

gan schools and communities taking actions
to remove these symbols on their own. A rush
to make this a federal case without first work-
ing with local schools to help ease a transi-
tion from traditional mascots to less offensive
ones will blunt the focused attention this
issue demands.
The call to bring in the federal government
on this issue has the potential to negatively
impact students. Taking federal funds does
little to create a positive educational environ-
ment for students who have no say in the cre-
ation of their mascots.
It's up to the communities, who have the
option to petition schools, to take a second
look at the implications of their local mascots
and revise them for the benefit of the com-
munity.
Should these communities fail to properly
remove these base mascots, federal involve-
ment could be considered. For now, this
should be seen as a local problem that will
take time, patience and the collaboration of
the community.

It's the arson and murder capital of
the country.
This is all less than an hour away
- in Flint, Mich.
When General Motors was at its
peak, they employed 80,000 people
in Flint. Today, about 7,000. It's the
story of the quintessential dying
manufacturing city. The entire
town functioned around Buick City.
seeing the shut doors of the manu-
facturing plant today, it's hard not
to feel helpless.
There are many misconceptions
that are perpetuated about poverty.
There are those who say a large part
of the country is "dependent;" those
who claim that "poor people" just
need to work harder, that "poor peo-
ple deserve tobe poor."
No one deserves to live in poverty.
It's easy to pass judgment on a
dire situation that you're removed
from. It's easy to say people in these
cities should just work harder, that
they should take ownership over
their lives. They should go to col-
lege or diversify their skill set. That
somehow it's their fault.
But more often than not, the real-
ity is quite different. And it's a real-
ity that doesn't sink in until you've
seen it with your own eyes.
Not everyone has the luxury to
pursue his or her own interests. Not
everyone has the resources or the
opportunity. Sometimes working as
hard as you possibly can still isn't
good enough. And when day-to-day

survival is a battle, there's no time
to prepare for the future. There's
a different dominant narrative at
play in Flint - one that most of us
can't even begin to understand.
Back in the day, the majority of
the blue-collar population in Flint
made a living from the GM plant.
Generations of people grew up
being told that GM would take care
of them. That if they were good on
their feet, clocked in on time and
did what they were told, they'd be
able to enjoy a comfortable life.
They were told to keep their heads
down, work hard and not ask ques-
tions. They were discouraged from
thinking critically or pursuing a life
beyond the plant.
To this day that mentality per-
sists. People in Flint are hanging on
because they've been told to hang
on. They believe this is just another
rough patch. That one day, manu-
facturing will come back and it'll
be okay.
In the rush to industrialize, we
completely disregarded human
capital. There was a time when
it didn't matter what education
level people had. We simply need-
ed those who had the skills to put
things together and the willingness
to work in the assembly lines. In
fact, we didn't want these people to
get a higher education - we wanted
an unskilled workforce. We cre-
ated the false belief that those jobs
would be around forever.
Then, the jobs got up and left for
another country.
Now, we blame these same people
for not "working hard enough," for
not "adjusting to the times." We cre-
ated the situation. And now we're
leaving them to fix it on their own.
And when I say, "we," yes, I mean
all of us.
We all acknowledge how bad the
circumstances are. We all mourn
over the state of the automotive
industry and espouse political
opinions about outsourcing and
American global competitiveness.
of course, we do this from the
safety of our suburban homes and
secure jobs. We talk about these
cities and how bad they are, but at
the end of the day we continue on
with our lives. Or worse, we dis-
tance ourselves - we joke about

We can't pick and
choose the parts of
Michigan we care for.
So, yes, things are bad. But, at
some level, is it really the fault of the
people? Or is the fault our own as we
stand by and allow this to happen?
Not all of you are going to get
up and drive to Flint to help out as
soon as you finish reading. It's okay
- I don't expect you to. The intent
isn't to guilt you into doing some-
thing, but to show you the reality
of the issue in the hopes that it just
might inspire a little bit of empathy
and compassion.
We might not all be able to go
make a difference, but the least we
can do is support those who are try-
ing. We can stop insulting these cit-
ies. We can stop making jokes about
the crime rate in Flint or the gangs
of Detroit. We can stop distancing
ourselves from these problems.
No, this isn't a "Detroit" thing or a
"Flint" thing. They aren't outcast
cities that must be avoided at all
costs. Statements like these make it
that much harder for those who are
working day and night toturn the
cities around. We can stop disown-
ing the cities and the people - for
better or for worse, they're ours.
Maybe it's time to re-evaluate
how we think about these strug-
gling cities. There are a lot of prob-
lems, and, quite honestly, it's hard
to know where to start. But the
spirit of the people is still amazing.
It's heartwarming to see people
who haven't given up - people who
continue to take on the problems
in the hopes that they'll be able to
make it a little better. Flint is still
a city of fighters. And the strength
and spirit of the people remains
unmatched.

This past Saturday night, a large,
black swastika was painted on The
Rock on the corner of Hill Street
and Washtenaw Avenue, along
with a series of offensive images
and words targeted toward other
minority groups. What we saw on
Sunday morning was vulgarity.
What we felt was disappointment,
surprise and confusion. Who did
this or what motivated them is
beyond us. But, as the Hillel execu-
tive board, it seemed natural for
us to immediately respond. Spray
paint and paintbrushes in hand,
we chose to not just mask the hate
we saw, but convey a message that
was more emblematic of what our
campus stands for - a message that
deserved to be conveyed to all those
that were exposed to The Rock:
"Expect Respect."
Immediately, we received sup-
port from university students,
organizations and administration.
Both the president of the LSA Stu-
dent Government and the president
of Central Student Government
reached out to us. Dean of Students
Laura Blake Jones showed her
encouragement and many others
demonstrated their commitment
to expecting respect on campus.
We were pleased, comforted and

inspired that campus leaders came
together so quickly after this action
- an action that impacted more
than just our community.
The Rock is a source of pride for
the University. It's a symbol that
unites us, a landmark we guard
when Michigan State comes to
town, a canvas layered with the dif-
ferent beliefs, identities and back-
grounds that comprise the student
body. It's a symbol that depicts how
we live together, how we cooper-
ate together and how we express
ourselves during the four years we
spend on campus. To denigrate The
Rock with a swastika isn't simply an
act against minority groups associ-
ated with the symbol - it's an act
against our campus and the beliefs
that lie at the core of this institution.
Can we attribute the immediacy
of our response to the swastika's
relevance to us? Sure. But what
we felt was a drive to protect not
just ourselves, but also other non-
Jewish students, 'our campus and
Ann Arbor from this message. We
weren't solely acting as Jewish stu-
dent leaders of Hillel; we were acting
as students and individuals desiring
to live in a community where we
can, quite frankly, expect respect.
This is the campus culture we are

trying to build and enhance - one
where students can feel comfortable
to express themselves and build an 4
identity that won't be threatened by
a shameful act of misconduct.
As we discussed the events
together, an essential question
emerged: Would we have acted as
immediately had the painted sym-
bol not been a swastika? In our
daily lives, would we say anythingif
we walked by other offensive imag-
es that didn't directly target us? If
we don't speak up, who will?
It's concerning that acts like
this still happen today. But when
they do, it's more important than
ever that we take a stance against
them. When we painted The Rock
with the words "Expect Respect,"
we made a commitment to honor
that phrase, that mentality and to
promote it throughout campus.
Together, let's begin thinking and
talking about how we choose to
speak up, how we choose to con-
tribute to a community where peo-
ple respect each other and how we
choose to expect respect.

uid water on the moon," Hui said.
While better technology
also allowed for the water to
be found, even he was skepti-
cal of the finding at first and
thought it could be contamina-
tion. Zhang said Hui persisted in
the research and the finding has
proved important.
Zhang and Hui both said this
finding might lead to a revision of

the giant impact theory, adding
that there are no current theo-
ries that provide a better expla-
nation.
"Impact formation scenario is
still the best theory for the moon
formation, but the problem is we
need to reconcile the hydrogen -
the water - with other volatile
elements," Hui said.'
Hui asked Clive Neal, a pro-
fessor of geology at Notre Dame,
to join the team in order to help
interpret the data findings.
It's still too soon to say if the
results are correct.

"It's early days yet to say
everything we knew about the
moon was wrong," Neal said. "It
may be that we need to adjust
those models of giant impact and
magna ocean a little bit rather
than say, 'oh, no, they cannot
have occurred."'
Neal said he is excited to
see what will come of this new
research.
"The moon itself is still reveal-
ing new secrets to useven though
Apollo ended in 1972 ... we're still
understanding a lot more about
our nearest neighbor."

GAME

wanted to finish what we had
started," Lee said. "From there,
we decided to join Friends-
Learn."
Lee believes that gaming as
education is a part of the grow-
ing trend of technology in the
classroom and can be an effec-
tive solution to many global
issues today.
"A lot of companies are mov-
ing towards 'gamification'...
and with this technology today,
learning really becomes acces-
sible and tangible at hand, even
from remote places." Lee said.
As of now, Fooya is in its
prototype, single-player ver-
sion. However, FriendsLearn
has started a Kickstarter cam-
paign in the hopes of expand-
ing Fooya to a multiplayer
platform, called "Fooya with
Friends." If they can garner
$50,000 by March 21, the proj-

ect can move forward.
Though they have had suc-
cess, Kim and Lee voiced
concerns about the spirit of
entrepreneurship at the Uni-
versity.
"We are indeed from Michi-
gan, and we do appreciate the
fact that entrepreneurship is
becoming a big boom here," Lee
said.
"At the same time, I feel like
there aren't enough resources
available at hand for students
to really get involved in. There
is a really high entry bar to this
entrepreneurship spirit here at
Michigan."
Kim noted that when he
and Lee approached the Cen-
ter for Entrepreneurship to
spread their startup's name,
CFE didn't promote the group
because FriendsLearn was not
rooted in the state.
"They would only be strictly
involved in student entrepre-
neurship or businesses sprang
from Michigan, only if there

was any stake for the Universi-
ty, because of the fact that it's a
public institution and it's fund-
ed by tax dollars." Kim said.
In the future, Lee and Kim
hope to create more educa-
tional games that will make an
impact.
"There's a big gap between
different backgrounds on
understanding finance across
the world," Lee said. "We can
leverage our financial knowl-
edge and educate people about
that."
Lee said he believes that
in order to effect meaningful
change in the world, one has to
take risks and harbor an endur-
ing vision.
"At the end of the day, what
really changes the world (are)
your radical ideas -contro-
versial ideas that people some-
times don't have belief (in), but
you just have to keep at it. I
think persistence and tenacity
is what really makes that."

Engelbert said she sees the

are more open to trying vegan
food.
"We will be able to experi-

expand what people think about
vegan food," she said. "And not
just locally, but we are putting
ourselves out there nationally as
a vegan destination."
An extensive new menu has
been created for the restaurant,
featuring items such as vegan
pizza, sushi and roasted root
vegetable pasties, like those
found in Michigan's Upper Pen-
insula. The restaurant will also
be serving up a wide array of

Wicha explained that recent

"The problem is, just shrinking

people from around the world

that the insight she has gained
from reading individuals'

greatest learning opportunities
- "better than any classroom or

"Michigan definitely has
a place in history for all the
things it's pioneered, so there's
a very natural partnership
between the University and
the Race Card Project," Norris
said. "Since we began this year,

surprised by the level of honesty
displayed by the submissions.
"Some of the posts will make

many limitations with the food
cart: Business was dependent on
the weather, there was limited
space to cook and certain cook-
ing equipment was impractical
to use.
"We couldn't do pizza in a cart
because we couldn't bake food

Engelbert said while she won't
miss being in the cart, she will
miss the atmosphere of Mark's

Lisa Sauv6 and Adam Smith,
designers at the Synecdoche
design studio, are looking to cre-
ate a modern, yet earthy ambi-
ance for The Lunch Room to mark
the move from cart to restaurant.
The space will feature decor such
as metal origami chairs, wood
paneling and green plants.
"We want to create a more
permanent, warm atmosphere
for people who are dining in,"
Sauve said.
They hope to find a way to
build an open kitchen within the
confines of the small restaurant
space.
"The space is small and the
ambitions are big," she said.
"The biggest challenge is layout
so far."

prone to become malignant.
Much of these findings were
discovered in recent research
that involved growing human
breast cells in Petri dishes and
in mice in research labs. Though
the research is promising, Wicha
said much more needs to be
done, especially for patients with
advanced stages of cancer.
"The goal is to cure cancer,"
Wicha said. "In the common
cancers, we've made really good
progress in treating early stages
of it, but in advanced cancers we
haven't made nearly enough prog-
ress."
Marty Fischhoff, the man-
aging director of the Taubman
Medical Research Institute,
said he is impressed by Wicha's
research.
"(Wicha) is one of the leading
figures in cancer research," Fis-
chhoff said. "When he first came
out with the hypothesis about

cancer stem cells it was revolu-
tionary and a lot of people didn't
believe it. Now the rest of the
world has come over. It's not uni-
versally accepted but most people
believe it's true."
Several student groups helped
organize the series. LSA sopho-
more Shivani Deshmukh said
she found Wicha's talk intel-
lectually stimulating. Desmukh
is a member of the Society of
Biology, the Student Society of
Stem Cell Research and the Uni-
versity's chapter of Alpha Chi
Sigma, a professional chemical
fraternity.
"Our entire goal of this lecture
series is to have medicine and
health-related TED-like talks,"
Deshmukh said. "I think this is
really good because stem cells are
a huge part of our society. Finally
the technology is coming to it. We
are literally on the brink of cancer
research."

Gov. Rick Scott
to propose bill to
state legislature
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -
Gov. Rick Scott announced plans
Wednesday to expand Medicaid
coverage to roughly 900,000
more people under the federal
health overhaul, a surprise deci-
sion from the vocal critic of Pres-
ident Barack Obama's plan.
Scott said he will ask the Leg-
islature to expand the program
under a bill that would expire in
three years, after which it would
require renewed legislative sup-
port. He's the seventh Republi-
can governor so far to propose
expanding the taxpayer-funded
health insurance program.
Scott said he would support
the expansion as long as the
federal government pays 100
percent of the increased costs,
which is the deal offered to
states by the Obama adminis-
tration for the first three years.
After that, the federal gov-
ernment said it would pay 90
percent of the cost for the addi-
tional enrollees.
The governor said he gained
new perspective after his moth-
er's death last year, calling his
decision to support a key pro-
vision of the Affordable Care
Act a "compassionate, common
sense step forward," and not a
"white flag of surrender to gov-
ernment-run healthcare."
"Before I ever dreamed of
standing here today as gover-
nor of this great state, I was a
strong advocate for better ways
to improve healthcare than the
government-run approach taken
in the President's healthcare law.
I believe in a different approach.
But, regardless of what I -
or anyone else - believes, a
Supreme Court decision and a
presidential election made the
President's healthcare mandates
the law of the land," Scott said at

a news conference.
The governor said he still
worries that the president's
plan could "lead to less patient
choice, worse care, and higher
costs" but he can't "in good
conscience deny the uninsured
access to care." Scott stressed
he won't simply deny new Med-
icaid recipients health insur-
ance after the three years are
up, but said he will spend that
time measuring how the expan-
sion impacts healthcare costs,
quality and access.
Scott, a former CEO of the
HCA hospital chain, entered
politics in 2009 running
national cable TV commercials
criticizing the president's plan.
Florida led the way in challeng-
ing the ACA in a lawsuit that
went all the way to the Supreme
Court. Scott also made the
rounds on conservative talk
shows repeatedly expressing
concern that expanding Med-
icaid would put too much of a
strain on Florida taxpayers.
At one point, he said the
expansion would cost $26 bil-
lion over the next decade, but
the state's health care agency
slashed its estimate to $3 billion
after backlash from lawmakers
over how the initial figure was
calculated. After Obama was
re-elected, Scott toned down
his rhetoric, signaling he want-
ed to work with federal health
officials. He even flew to Wash-
ington to meet with Health
and Human Services Secretary
Kathleen Sebelius last month to
discuss the expansion.
Florida lawmakers must still
sign off on Scott's decision, and
the Legislature doesn't meet
until next month.
"I am personally skeptical
that this inflexible law will
improve the quality of health-
care in our state and ensure our
long-term financial stability,"
Florida House Speaker Will
Weatherford said.
Angry conservatives said

Scott owes his support base an
explanation.
"I am flabbergasted. This
is a guy who, before he was a
candidate for governor, started
an organization to fight 'Obam-
acare' in the expansion of medi-
cal entitlements. This is a guy
who said it will never happen on
his watch. Well, here it is," said
Slade O'Brien, Florida director
of the conservative group Amer-
icans for Prosperity.
Scott's announcement came
hours after federal health offi-
cials said they plan to approve
the state's longstanding request
to privatize its Medicaid pro-
gram statewide if they agree
to beef up transparency and
accountability measures. He
said that decision signaled that
feds were willing to work with
the state to give them the flex-
ibility they need.
The other six GOP gover-
nors who plan to expand the
program are the leaders of
Michigan, Ohio, Arizona, New
Mexico, Nevada and North
Dakota. So far 21 states plus
Washington, D.C., plan to
expand their Medicaid pro-
grams under the health care
law. Fourteen states have said
they'll turn it down, although
the debate is still going in sev-
eral of them. Another 15 are
weighing options.
Under the federal law, states
were given the choice of whether
to expand Medicaid to people
whose incomes equal 138 percent
of the federal poverty level -
about $15,000 for an individual
and $32,000 for a family of four.
Florida has one of the high-
est rates of uninsured resi-
dents in the country and some
of the most stringent eligibility
requirements. A family of three
with income of $11,000 a year
makes too much and single resi-
dents are not covered. The bulk
of residents getting coverage
under the Medicaid expansion
will be childless adults.


Norris has worked with sev-
eral other universities across
the country with smaller events
but said this partnership is by
far the most formal. She believes
that the concept of the theme
semester is an important one, so
long as it gets people in an open
conversation about race.
"That's what this project is all
about - to get people to talk and
understand one another," Norris
said. "It's a portal to things you
wouldn't normally say aloud, a
window and a mirror in a sense,
allowing you to better under-
stand others and yourself."
Norris will be visiting Ann
Arbor in March to meet with
University President Mary Sue
Coleman, and again in April
for a series of lectures and dia-
loguestwith students ahoutrthe
concept of race and the race
cards submitted.
Theme semester co-chair
Martha Jones said the Race
Card Project is a major aspect
of the theme semester, which
includes more than 100 events,
16 exhibitions and courses
revolving around the concept of
race on a global scale.
Jones was "pleasantly sur-
prised" by the enthusiastic
response of the community.
"I think it's an opportunity
for reflection and only having
six words really helps narrow
down what it is you want to say,"
Jones said. "There was a post
written entirely in French, and,
reading it, I thought that was
so indicative of Michigan, that
someone would feel comfort-
able enough to write in their
native tongue to express how
they feel."

Jones felt that because the
University itself is such a glob-
al campus, the community
was ready to take this big step
toward having more open dis-
cussions about race.
Anthropology Prof. Bruce
Mannheim, who used his six
words to say, "Still a long way to
go," said he believes that while
racism in our country has a lot
to do with slavery, it's not all
historical at this point.
"A lot of people believe that
because the institution of slav-
ery is over, racism is an issue of
the past," Mannheim said. "A
lot of everyday practices seem
unaware of the implications of
racism on an institutional level."
Mannheim added that he'd
like to see the University
become even more of a "global
campus," especially in regard to
increasing intellectual diversity.
"Race can be complex and
messy, but that doesn't mean
that we can choose to ignore it,"
Mannheim said.
Art & Design freshman Jil-
lian Manning said her desire to
experience diversity was one of
the things that drew her toward
the University in the first
place, though she initially had
concerns about inadvertently
offending people she wasn't
accustomed to inter'acting with.
"The community here is very
open about race, but there are
still people here like me who
are from small towns and might
want to sweep it under the rug
like it doesn't matter," Manning
said. "As in almost everything
in life, conversation is key, and
we just have to keep working for
that."

Police admit mistakes in
Pistorius investigation

Authorities now
have no evidence
challenging
Olympians claims
PRETORIA, South Africa
(AP) - The prosecution case
against Oscar Pistorius began
to unravel Wednesday with
revelations of a series of police
blunders and the lead investiga-
tor's admission that authorities
have no evidence challenging
the double-amputee Olympian's
claim he killed his girlfriend
accidentally.
Detective Hilton Botha's
often confused testimony left
prosecutors rubbing their heads
in frustration as he misjudged
distances and said testosterone
- banned for professional ath-
letes in some cases - was found
at the scene, onlyto be later con-
tradicted by the prosecutor's
office.
The second day of what was
supposed to be a mere bail hear-
ing almost resembled a full-
blown trial for the 26-year-old
runner, with his lawyer, Barry
Roux, tearing into Botha's testi-
mony step by step during cross
examination.
Police, Botha acknowledged,
left a 9 mm slug from the bar-
rage that killed Reeva Steen-
kamp inside a toilet and lost
track of illegal ammunition
found inside the house. And
the detective himself walked
through the crime scene with-
out wearing protective shoe
covers, potentially contaminat-
ing the area.
Authorities, Roux asserted,
were selectively taking "every
piece of evidence to try to
extract the most possibly nega-
tive connotation and present it
to the court."
The case has riveted South
Africa, with journalists and the
curious crowding into the brick-
walled courtroom where Pisto-
rius, dubbed the Blade Runner'
for his prosthetic legs, faces a
charge of premeditated murder
in the Valentine's Day slaying.
Pistorius says he mistook

Steenkamp for an intruder and
shot her out of fear, while prose-
cutors say he planned the killing
and attacked her as she cowered
behind a locked bathroom door.
The day seemed to start out
well for the prosecution, with
Botha offering new details of
the shooting that appeared to
call into question Pistorius'
account of the moments leading
up to the 29-year-old model's
death.
Ballistic evidence, he said,
showed the bullets that killed
her had been fired from aheight,
supporting the prosecution's
assertion that Pistorius was
wearing prosthetic legs when
he took aim at the bathroom
door. The athlete has main-
tained he was standing only on
his stumps, and felt vulnerable
and frightened as he opened fire
from a low position.
Projecting a diagram of the
bedroom and the bathroom,
prosecutor Gerrie Nel said it
showed Pistorius had to walk
past his bed to get to the bath-
room and could not have done
so without seeing that Steen-
kamp was not asleep there.
"There's no other way of get-
ting there," Nel said in disputing
Pistorius' claim that he had no
idea Steenkamp was no longer
in bed when he pumped four
bullets into the bathroom door,
striking her with three.
Botha backed the prosecutor
up, saying the holster for Pis-
torius' 9 mm pistol was found
under the left side of the bed,
where Steenkamp slept, and it
would have been impossible for
Pistorius to get the gun without
checking to see if she was there.
"I believe that he knew that
Reeva was in the bathroom and
he shot four shots through the
door," the detective said.
Botha described how bullets
struck Steenkamp in the head
and shattered her right arm and
hip, eliciting sobs from Pisto-
rius, who held his head in hands.
However, when asked if
Steenkamp's body showed "any
pattern of defensive wounds" or
bruising from an assault, Botha
said "no." He again responded
"no"when asked if investigators

found anything inconsistent
with Pistorius'version of events,
though he later said nothing
contradicted the police version
either.
Testimony began with the
prosecutor tellingthe court that
before the shooting, a neigh-
bor heard "nonstop" shouting
between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. at Pis-
torius' upscale home in a gated
community in the capital, Pre-
toria.
However, Botha later said
under cross examination that
the witness was in a house 600
yards (550 meters) away, pos-
sibly out of earshot. He cut that
estimate in half when ques-
tioned again by the prosecutor,
as confusion reigned for much
of his testimony.
At one point, Botha told the
court that police found syringes
and two boxes of testosterone in
Pistorius' bedroom - testimony
the prosecution later withdrew,
saying it was too early to identi-
fy the substance, which was still
being tested.
"It is not certain (what it is)
until the forensics" are complet-
ed, Medupe Simasiku, a spokes-
man for South Africa's National
Prosecution Agency, told The
Associated Press. It's not clear if
it was "alegal or an illegal medi-
cation for now."
The defense also disputed the
claim. "It is an herbal remedy,"
Roux said. "It is not ... a banned
substance."
Still, Botha offered poten-
tially damaging details about
Pistorius' past, saying the ath-
lete was once involved in an
accidental shooting at a restau-
rant in Johannesburg and asked
someone else "to take the rap."
The runner also threatened
men on two separate occasions,
Botha said, allegedly telling one
he'd "break his legs."
The detective said police
found two iPhones in Pistorius'
bathroom and two BlackBerrys
in his bedroom, and none had
been used to phone for help.
Guards at the gated commu-
nity did call the athlete, Botha
said, and all he said was: "I'm
all right," as he wept uncontrol-
lably.

Military intervention
a growing possibility
as critiques pour in
CAIRO (AP) - Egypt's pow-
erful military is showing signs
of growing impatience with the
country's Islamist leaders, indi-
rectly criticizing their policies
and issuing thinly veiled threats
that it might seize power again.
The tension is raising the spec-
ter of another military interven-
tion much like the one in 2011,
when generals replaced long-
time authoritarian leader Hosni
Mubarak after they sided with
anti-regime protesters in their
18-day popular uprising.
The strains come at a time
when many Egyptians are
despairing of an imminent end
to the crippling political impasse
between President Mohammed
Morsi and his Muslim Brother-
hood group on one side, and the
mostly secular and liberal oppo-
sition on the other.
The tug of war between the
two camps is being waged against
a grim backdrop of spreading
unrest, rising crime and a wors-
ening economy.
"In essence, the military will

Early on, Hill is a
force on the mound

Redshirt sophomore Justin Rossi has had to deal with multiple injuries over his Michigan career, but seems to be back on the trajectory for success this season.

By JASON RUBINSTEIN
For the Daily
To classify redshirt sopho-
more Justin Rossi's tennis career
as frustrating would be a great
understatement. Rossi has been
through just about everything,
from facing tough opponents to
having multiple injuries in his
college career.
Rossi, a native of Novi, Mich.,
was a blue-chip recruit out of
high school and was a top-20
player in the country according to
tennisrecruiting.net and helped
headline a top-five recruiting
class for the Wolverines in 2010.
Growing up near Ann Arbor,
Rossi was familiar with the pro-
gram and the staff.
"(Rossi) was definitely regard-
ed very high because of his junior
results," said junior Shaun Bern-
stein. "He was thought as one of
the top guys from our class and
was expected to work extremely
hard. He had a very good reputa-
tion as ahard worker and practice
player. He definitely had some
high expectations coming in."
Rossi stepped in and proved to

be type of player the Wolverines
had recruited. He competed well
in the fall, and rightfully secured
a top spot for Michigan's dual
season.
"We thought he was one of the
toughest guys on the team," said
Michigan coach Bruce Berque.
"We had a group of guys at a simi-
lar level, but we thought Justin
was the toughest and most resil-
ient and could handle the pres-
sure of playing a top spot."
But the dual season provided
challenges that Rossi hadn't seen
before. Rossi was not exposed to
top-tier competition week after
week in high school. His col-
lege inexperience showed as he
finished the season with a 15-18
record.
The results might not have
been what he expected, but the
future remained very bright.
"Going into my sophomore
year I was playingthe best tennis
I have ever played," Rossi said. "I
was looking forward to the sea-
son and becoming a dominant
force on the court."
Just as Rossi had become
accustomed to the college game,

things took a drastic turn. While
playing at the Harvard Invita-
tional, Rossi chased a ball and
planted his right foot funny. And
a loud snap later, Rossi's career
looked bleak.
Lucky enough for Rossi, an
orthopedic surgeon had been sit-
ting in the stands and rushed out
onto the court to put his foot back
in place.
Rossi had broken both his tibia
and fibula. Three weeks after the
injury, Rossi had surgery on both
parts and started rehabbing so he
could play in the spring season.
Two plates and 12 screws later,
Rossi's fibula still hadn't fully
healed. For precautionary rea-
sons, Rossi had to get a second
surgery.
After the second surgery, the
future remained bright for Rossi,
who had hoped to make it back
for the Big Ten season. But just
as things were looking favorable,
Rossi broke his fifth metatarsal
on his left foot during a rehab
session. This led Rossi to take a
medical redshirt.
But Rossi would not let this
bump in the road stop him. He's

almost back to full strength and
is now becoming a steady con-
tributor for the Wolverines. His
on-the-court energy is electric
and his joking attitude is all back
- something Berque said the team
greatly missed.
"The injury has made me
stronger," Rossi said. "When you
face adversity and overcome it, it
makes you stronger as a person
and I used that to fuel me on the
court."
Rossi is beginning to regain
form, as he faces one last obstacle
- trust. Once Rossi believes he
won't reinjure himself, he can be
the star that Michigan coaches
once believed he could be. There
is no doubt teammates think
highly of Rossi.
"He has a huge upside," Bern-
stein said. "He is one of the best
athletes on the team. He has a
ton of power and an unbelievable
work ethic, and I think by next
year he will be able to compete for
a top spot in the lineup and earn
a national ranking. He has a real
shot at making an impact on col-
legiate tennis."

Michigan baseball's pitching
performance during its season-
opening series against Califor-
nia was lackluster, and that's
putting it nicely.
A multitude of starters and
relievers gave up 28 hits and it
runs in the first two games of the
weekend.
To some extent, this show-
ing was expected. With a new
coaching staff, an incredibly
young team and an unsolidified
bullpen, nobody was expecting
perfection.
But after losing the first two
games, 5-4 and then 6-5, a sur-
prising performance came on
Sunday morning when Michigan
coach Erik Bakich chose to start
freshman pitcher Evan Hill.
"I was a little nervous, this
was my first time," Hill said.
"I'm a freshman and I needed
to make a good performance so
that the coaches know they can
trust me and my abilityto pitch."
In his first collegiate start,
Hill struck out three and
allowed just five hits and one
earned run in seven innings.
While Michigan couldn't pull
out the win, the performance
by Hill definitely sent a positive
wave through the dugout.
"He pitched terrific - he did
notlooklike afreshman," Bakich
said. "Evan did everything we
needed him to do to put us in a
position to win that game."
While only a freshman, Hill
has been pegged as a player to
keep an eye on since his high-
school days.
He earned three consecutive
varsity letters and went 8-3 on
the mound in his senior season
at Mount Pleasant (Mich.) High
School.
Hill will tell you himself that

his biggest strength right now
is being able to spot his fastball,
but he also catches batters off
guard with his curveball and
changeup, which he's constantly
working to improve.
"I'm doing the same things
over and over to create consis-
tency in my pitching area and
pitching mechanics," Hill said.
Hill stands at 6-foot-5, and
with his large athletic frame, he
holds a strong presence on the
mound.
He was an important recruit
for Michigan, and has adjusted
well to the new setting.
"(College baseball) is a huge
transition in the fact that it's so
much more time consuming and
it takes a lot more work and ded-
ication," Hill said. "But I think
it's a huge factor in maturity and
becoming more of a man on the
field - taking more responsibili-
ty for the things going on around
you."
Hill's pitching on Sunday
came as a warranted relief dur-
ing a weekend clouded with dis-
content. But Bakich is confident
that in the next few weeks, per-
formances like the one Hill had
will become much more com-
mon.
"We're still ironing out all
the roles of the bullpen and the
pitching staff, and making sure
we put our players in the right
spot to have success," Bakich
said.
The weekend might not have
ended exactly the way the team
was hoping, but for Hill, it was a
positive learning experience for
growth on the mound.
"Even though we got the
loss ... I think it helps me in my
confidence knowing that I can
give the team a really good per-
formance like that," Hill said.
"Hopefully we can score some
runs and get some victories."

- Nebraska, 'M' both
htin for 20th win

The Michigan women's bas-
ketball team has resurged itself
in the Big Ten with two straight
upset wins. On Thursday, the
Wolverines have an opportunity
to topple another ranked oppo-
nent and regain a foothold in the
conference standings with a win
over No. 24 Nebraska.
In one of the Big Ten's premier
matchups, Michigan will fight
to maintain its recent winning-
streak against
the red-hot Nebraska at
Cornhuskers.

The Wolver-
ines have had a
bumpy road through the Big Ten,
but they now find themselves
with the chance to compete for a
top-three conference ranking.
After four straight wins to
start conference play, Michi-
gan dropped four of its next five
games. A recent momentum
swing has earned the Wolverines
big wins over Illinois, Purdue and
Michigan State.
Sunday's 70-69 upset of the in-
state rival Spartans marked a new
pinnacle for Michigan's season.
Senior guard Jenny Ryan led the
Wolverines, who broke a 12-game
losing streak against Michigan
State, by scoring a career-high
24 points without tallying a turn-
over. Ryan's effort earned her the
Big Ten Player of the Week award
on Tuesday - the first time she
has received the honor.

Thursday, Nebraska improved

seven games. During the stretch,
the Huskers have won four con-
secutive games on the road.
While Nebraska currently holds
the second-best record in the Big
Ten, a loss to Michigan would
give both teams identical 9-4 con-
ference records.
While Ryan's leadership has
focused the Wolverines as of late,
it's senior guard Kate Thomp-
son who leads the team on
offense. Thompson's team-high
15.5 points per game has car-
ried Michigan as of late and has
also given her confidence in her
3-point shooting. Senior forward
Rachel Sheffer holds down the
interior for Michigan, scoring
12.6 points and pulling down six
rebounds per game.
The Huskers have been fueled
by the play of junior forward
Jordan Hooper, who's averaged
21.9 points and 7.7 rebounds dur-
ing Nebraska's current winning
streak. Hooper's impressive play
this season is worthy of consid-
eration for Big Ten Player of the

Year honors.
Assisting Hooper is senior
guard Lindsey Moore, whose
averaging 14.9 points and 5.44
assists per game this season.
Moore is expected to make her
124th-consecutive start against
the Wolverines, as she has started
in every game of her career as a
Husker.
The showdown at Crisler Cen-
ter is a must-win situation for
both teams as they head into the
postseason. If Michigan wins
its remaining four games, which
includes a difficult road game
at Penn State, it places itself in
a favorable position for second
place in the conference. Nebraska
is in a similar situation, with a
good opportunity to continue its
winning streak until the regular-
season finale against Penn State at
home. Nonetheless, the winner of
Thursday's game determines its
fate in the conference, while the
loser risks falling into the three-
team log jam for a first-round bye
at the Big Ten Tournament.

'Super Fan' Nicholls
rewarded by CCHA

By MATT SLOVIN
ManagingEditor
Mike Nicholls' passion-
ate following of the Michigan
hockey team has brought him
everywhere from Alaska to New
Hampshire.
Now, it's taking the Allen
Park, Mich. native into down-
town Detroit.
Nicholls was named the
CCHA's Super Fan representing
Michigan last week, and he'll be
rewarded with an all-expenses
paid trip to the league playoffs'
finals at Joe Louis Arena on
March 22-24.
Typically, the free trip would
have made him giddy.
But this hasn't been a typical
season for the Michigan hockey
team ("22 years worth of bad
bounces," Nicholls said), which
will enter the CCHA playoffs
on March 8 as one of the confer-
ence's longest shots to make it
to Joe Louis Arena, where the
final four teams compete for the
league's automatic bid to the
NCAA Tournament.
So when he was named Michi-
gan's CCHA Super Fan represen-
tative, Nicholls accepted with a
hint of reluctance.
"I'll go, but it definitely won't
be as interesting without (Michi-
gan) in there," he said.
While the Wolverines' NCAA-

come to an end in the coming

The men's swimming team will go for its third straight Big Ten championship in Bloomington next week.
'M' looking for next Big Ten crown

By RAJAT KHARE
Daily Sports Writer
Winning isn't easy - especial-
ly in the Big Ten. But nobody has
told the No. 2 Michigan men's
swimming and divingteam that.
The Wolverines will travel
to Bloomington from Feb. 27
to March 2 in search of their
third-straight Big Ten Champi-
onship. And if this season's per-
formance is any indication, the
trophy should be headed back to
Ann Arbor for another year.
"I think we're going in with
some great momentum," said
Michigan coach Mike Bottom.
"We've had some fast meets as
we've moved forward to this
one, and we look at it like we're
just gaining more momentum."
The Wolverines boast a per-
fect 6-0 record against Big Ten
teams, with a 8-0 record overall.
Though the unblemished record
itself is impressive, it's even
more so when the quality of
their opponents and the margin
of victory are factored in.
Against the three Big Ten
teams currently ranked in the
nation's top 15 - No. 8 Indiana,
No. 13 Ohio State and No. 14
Minnesota - Michigan has post-
ed scores of 223-77, 251-75 and

170-124, respectively.
"Our team has gotten stron-
ger every competition," Bottom
said. "Whether the competition
was stronger or not, our team
got stronger."
But needless to say, when
it comes to a Big Ten Champi-
onship meet, regular-season
records become meaningless.
And for a team fostering new-
comers in freshmen Dylan Bosh
and Anders Lie Nielson, adjust-
ing to the meet atmosphere
could be a challenge.
"There is no conference meet
like (Big Ten) in the country,"
Bottom said. "We have the fast-
est conference meet in the coun-
try, depth-wise, and as we've
moved forward throughout the
year, we've told them 'this is
nothing, the next one is going to
be harder, the next one is going
be harder' and so we've pre-
pared them."
But this meet - and the sea-
son really - isn't about the new-
comers. It's about those who are
leaving,
This year's senior class is Bot-
tom's first recruiting class, and
effectively the leaders of this
team.
"Every year you lose a class
and you gain a class, so you

really have a big turnover rate
in the four-year time," Bottom
said. "Every year means a lotto
each team that wins a champi-
onship."
It's a motto he has reiter-
ated throughout the season -
these athletes aren't swimming
for themselves, rather, they're
swimming for each other. And
it's fair to say that this emphasis
has paid off, as the team looks
ahead to its seasongoal: NCAAs.
"In swimming it's easier (to
stay motivated) because you can
look at the times that are being
posted," Bottom said. "They
see that Stanford, Cal, USC and
Texas and Arizona and Auburn
and all of those teams are put-
ting up very fast times and we
know that we are going to face
those teams at NCAAs."
Though on its journey tocom-
peting at the NCAAs Champi-
onships, Michigan cannot take
anything for granted. As far
too many teams have found out,
winning in the Big Ten confer-
ence doesn't come easy.
If the Wolverines are to com-
plete their three-peat in Bloom-
ington, they'll have to do what
they've done all season - com-
pete for each other, one race at
a time.

Post players struggling to find consistency

By FEERETT COOK
aily Sports Editor
It's hard to quantify the loss
of a player like Jordan Morgan,
Michigan basketball's best and
most experienced post player.
The redshirt junior isn't someone
that racks up impressive offensive
statistics, but his presence was
missed immediately after he suf-
fered a right-ankle sprain against
Illinois on Jan. 27.
Michigan coach John Beilein
thought that Morgan would only
be out for a week or so, but the
injury still hasn't fully improved
almost a month later. The cen-
ter's absence has forced two other
Wolverines- redshirtsophomore
Jon Horford and freshman Mitch
McGary - to claim bigger roles,
with varying levels of success.
Without Morgan, Michigan's
lack of consistency in the post
has been more noticeable in

some games than in others, with
the best examples coming over a
recent eight-day stretch.
Beilein has been forced to tin-
ker with his starting lineup with-
out a healthy Morgan, resulting
in three different starting big
men over the last three contests.
Beilein doesn't seem any closer
to finding the right combination,
though, because none of the three
options worked out particularly
well. Until Morgan's ankle is fully
recovered, Beilein will have to
keep tinkering.
Against Wisconsin, Horford
started his fourth straight game,
despite previously struggling to
be dependable in that role. He had
another off performance, tallying
just two points and two rebounds
in seven minutes.
Off the bench, McGary had
one of his most complete perfor-
mances of the season. He scored
12 points and grabbed eight

rebounds while showing off an
improved jump shot in a career-
high 32 minutes on the court.
So the next game, a huge tilt
on the road against then-No. 8
Michigan State, Beilein replaced
the struggling Horford with his
true freshman - McGary's first
career start.
In a hostile Breslin Center,
the results weren't much better.
McGary looked flustered from the
start, committing as many turn-
overs as points scored - four - in
26 minutes while getting beat up
defensively by the Spartans' vet-
eran frontcourt. Off the bench,
Horford and Morgan weren't
much help, combining for one
point and three rebounds.
Their Michigan State counter-
part, senior Derrick Nix, finished
with almost three times as many
points as three Wolverines com-
bined (14), and didn't miss a shot
until there were less than two

minutes remaining in the first
half
This all culminated in a near-
disaster against the worst team in
the Big Ten, Penn State, last Sun-
day. Morgan started his firstgame
since being injured, and while he
didn't seem fully recovered, the
results were still expected to be
better than the previous games.
But in a lazy Sunday of a game,
Michigan got a grand total of zero
points from its post players.
Morgan looked slower and
more tentative than he did before
the injury, especially when trying
to get around screens on defense,
and isn't close to the level he was
at before the Illinois game.
"We are still challenged right
now with Jordan Morgan,"
Beilein said after the game on
Sunday. "(Penn State) is a great
ball-screen team, and they will
run your five men off ball screens
all day lone and Jordan Morgan

cannot do that justyet.
"He's very slow at it, and until
he gets better, that really affects
us."
After the Michigan State game,
Morgan said that he was feeling
"fine," and healthy enough to play,
even though the ankle was clearly
slowing him down.
Before the injury, Morgan
had started 19 games, averaging
almost seven points and a little
over five rebounds in almost 20
minutes per game.
Since the injury? Four games
played (with one game started),
with one point in 22 total minutes.
"We had no idea that Jordan
Morgan would take this long,"
Beilein said. "He wants to play,
he's insisting on playing, he's
insisting on comingto practice, so
you've got to trust him. But when
you watch himmove out there, it's
not happening. He's delayed."
This wouldn't be as big of a deal

if Horford or McGary had taken
advantage of the starting oppor-
tunity, but neither big man has
stepped up.
Plus, the difference between
Morgan and the other two Wol-
verine post players is significantly
different on defense. Without the
defensive-minded Morgan in the
middle of the defense, Michigan
has given up more back cuts and
easy baskets near the hoop then
ever before.
Coincidentally, or maybe not
coincidentally, Michigan has had
its first real slump of the season
since Morgan's injury, losing
three of its last five games. One of
those wins came awfully close to
a loss against Penn State, which
still doesn't have a conference
win.
If Morgan's ankle doesn't
cooperate, then there's a good
chance Michigan's season won't,
either.

S"EP INTO THE SALON ' FORREST GUMP' (1994), PARAMOUNT
RedeeminG 'ump'

Learning to love Mozart

Daily Arts Writers Tyler
Bailey and Noah Cohen step
into the salon for a friendly
debate on the
1995 Academy Awards.
Tyler: The choice of "Forrest
Gump" over "Shawshank Redemp-
tion" in 1995 is, in my mind, one
of the greatest atrocities in Oscar
history. "Shawshank" is as close as
you cangetto aperfectmovie - an
elegantly crafted story of deliver-
ance and friendship set in the harsh
backdrop of an oppressive prison.
Although some might argue that
there was never a doubt that jus-
tice would finally run its course in
the plot, the movie crafts situations
that seem so convincingly hopeless
they transcendthe plane ofthe film
screen and shake you to your core.
And in that way, it's easy to forget
that it's all part of a constructed
narrative. "Gump," while emotion-
ally movingat points, falls too heav-
ily on thinly worntropes - the love
story being the most obvious of all.
Noah:Ifyouhaveaproblemwith
obvious plot direction and worn
tropes, I don't understand how you
can defend "Shawshank." All the
evidence points to your protagonist
being guilty, so of course he's inno-
cent. Allthe evidence points to your
protagonist dying in prison, so of
course he escapes. Despite all the
talk about unexpected plot twists,
"Shawshank" follows the obvious
direction of a jail movie to the let-
ter. "ForrestGump" doesnotderive
its magic from the borrowed emo-
tional taps of guilt, punishment and
the desire for freedom. It makes
its own emotional universe from
scratch. "Shawshank" understands
a prison. "Gump" understands a
world.
Tyler: I can hardly agree that
"Gump"understands aworld when
the character's interactions with
that world boil down to constant
pandering to endless pop-culture

PARAMOUNT

The Oscars is like a box of chocolates.
references and a watered down
romp through various bastardized
historical events in search of his
"onetruelove." Hemayunderstand
the bizzaro world where the good
guy always gets the girl and mama
always knows best, but I'll take
"Shawshank"'s depiction of a pris-
on any day. Although it does seem
to end up that ultimate justice is
finally realized for Andy Dufresne
- the journey is much more har-
rowing than it may appear. His wife
is still dead, and her killer still not
brought to justice. I feel that no film
that year was able to portray the
deterioration and redemption of a
man with such painstaking emo-
tion.
Noah: As I took it, the simplicity
of "Gump" 's world was an hom-
age to the idea that we complicate
our own lives with needless worry
about purpose and destiny. "Gump"
welcomes us into a mind that has
faith in simple virtues and juxta-
position. Jenny's plot arc wildly
diverges from Forrest's to provide
context for the sweet simplicity
that Forrest constructs for himself
and, in narration, superimposes
upon his life story. What you deem
a fault of "Gump" is, to me, its most
lovable quirk: an appreciation for
what you have and what you are
that acknowledges you aren't the
smartest cookie in the batch, but
gives you permission to love your-
self anyway.
Tyler:Alright, I can understand
the reasons why someone might

appreciate "Forrest Gump," and I
can say that I've enjoyed watch-
ing it - butI just cannot justify the
decision that was made to award
"Gump" the most prestigious honor
in film above both "The Shawshank
Redemption" and "Pulp Fiction."
"Shawshank" is almost universally
recognized as one of, if not the best
movie ever made. It'sextremelysad
that the superior movie was denied
the award just because it wasn't as
successful at the box office as "For-
rest Gump."
Noah: I don't know how the
Academy decides what movie
should win Best Motion Picture,
but they have to give some cre-
dence to popularity. This having
been said, I don't think it's fair
to sweep "Forrest Gump" off the
table as though it can't compete
with the legends of "Shawshank"
and "Pulp." It's not right tolet the
legend of something predetermine
your opinion of it. "Forrest Gump"
does not roar to its conclusion in
the emotional chariot of some vic-
torious singularity like redemp-

age doesn't always roar. Some-

First, I began to find all of this

practicing scales, completing
theory workbook assignments,
waiting to play more difficult
pieces until I was "ready" -
positively insufferable. Second,,
I was an advanced player for

I was good at it, and I loved to

The script, penned by Pesquei-

remaining two virgins to "shoot-

loosely based on the writer's real-
life experiences.
"I guess I had a lot of virgin
friends one year, and then in like
six months, they all were not vir-

as someone lost their virginity,
it was like a snowball effect and
they all lost it, so I thought it
made for a funny story."
"The V Card" is an ode to Ann
Arbor and to college life at the
University, and was filmed at
many notable locations on cam-
pus, including - as co-director
Verdi recounted - the Big House.
"We had one hour to get
that entire sequence (at the
Big House) filmed before they
kicked us out," Verdi said. "And
it was one of the weirdest, most
intense, most amazing experi-
ences of my college career, and
I imagine everybody else's too."
Verdi and Burnstein conduct-

number of resources by the Uni-
versity for the filming process,
including the use of the Red One

according to Verdi, that "The
Social Network" was shot on.
As Burnstein recalled, the
potential trials of co-directing
a film were greatly alleviated
by the fact that he and Verdi are
close friends.
"We were completely and
utterly on the same page the
entire time," Burnstein said.
"It was almost like osmosis. We
always knew what each other
was thinking, and we did every-
thing together and didn't divide
any jobs up."
Upon graduating, Burnstein
plans to join Verdi, who is now
working as a production coor-
dinator in Los Angeles, and the
two aspire to work together
and develop film projects in the
future. Brown, who has a back-
ground in theater, hopes to move
to New York after graduating to
pursue an entertainment career.
Pesqueira is currently working
with Jim Burnstein, her former
professor, to refine and expand
"The V Card" script into a mar-

As the Oscar race draws to
a close, speculation continues
about the year's most coveted
and contested awards. But just
because "Best Picture" and
"Best Directing" are the only
things entertainment reporters
want to debate, this shouldn't
diminish the significance of the
other awards. One category that
has always remained inextrica-
bly linked to the final stretch of
the awards season is "Best Musi-
cal Score." Often overlooked,
a musical score can make or
break a film by providing it
with the right soul. Recently,
the Daily discussed the process
and experience of film scoring
with renowned composer James
Newton Howard.
Like most composers, How-
ard should be well known to film
enthusiasts. If you haven't heard
of him, you've heardfrom him by
way of his work in scoring more
than 130 movies since he got into
the business in the 1980s.
"I never meant to choose this
career path," Howard explained.
"I started classical piano lessons
and I was something of a prodi-
gious pianist. And it was shortly
after that that I realized I was
pretty good, but I wasn't any-
where near good enough to have
a career as a concert pianist, nor
did I want one.
"I was sort of tired of prac-
ticing the piano, and I was very
much drawn to popular music;
so I dropped out of (the Univer-
sity of Southern California) sort
of embarrassingly, six or seven
weeks into my freshman year,
and turned down a full scholar-
ship, which was kind of traumat-
ic - but I just had to do it."
In 1975, Howard was hired
by Elton John to play keyboards
and do orchestration. After a
few years, he went on to work
as a session musician, arranger
and orchestrator for record pro-
duction. He was offered his first
movie score in 1985.
"I didn't know how to write
music to picture - how to syn-
chronize the music - and I
didn't know what I could write
in six weeks or eight weeks,"
Howard said. "Then I was talked
into it ... and I don't mean to be
simplistic, but I was just head
over heels in love from day one."
His creative process is simple:
Write music.
"I think what happens is if
one starts to try and look at an
image of a movie and try and
immediately write music that

As the music industry and
process of score production
evolve, Howard tries to keep up
to date on the latest techniques
and musical synthesis.
"I was a synthesis and a key-
board player when I was with
bands back in the '70s and '80s,
so I learned the idea of working
with electronics and working
in recording environment," he
said. "I seek out younger people
to do programming for me. Like
on 'The Bourne Legacy,' for
instance, there was a real need
for that to be a more electroni-
cally oriented score, and I listed
other people to come in and
help me with the programming,
which I think was successful."
According to Howard, all he
hopes for at the end of the day is
a well made movie.
"When you get a movie like
a 'Michael Clayton' or a '(The)
Hunger Games,' that's really an
exceptionally well made movie,
it always makes everybody work
better. I can write my best score
for a bad movie and nobody
notices, and I can write a medio-
cre score for a great movie and
everybody thinks it's a great
score. It's all context."
Moving forward, much of
Howard's repertoire will depend
on established relationships
with directors like "Catching
Fire" director Francis Law-
rence, and he aspires to keep his
music relevant and emotionally
charged.
"I think everything inspires
me. What is inspiration other
than the totality of your life
experience? It's not as though I
have a moment and it inspires me
to go write. I think inspiration
just consists of some reservoir of
life experiences that you're con-
nected to and you start the cre-
ative process."

MARLENE LACASSE/Daily
Nicole Gellman and Yaqi Ge head a female-dominant creative team for 'Fender,'
Cinema's glass ceilig remains solid

Students prepare
to enter a male-
dominated industry
ByKAYLAUPADHYAYA
ManagingArts Editor
What's your favorite movie from
the past year?
When you talk about film and
television as much as I do, you
become accustomed to the ques-
tion. And choosing favorites isn't
something I like to do, so I usually
rattle off a list.
But I noticed something about
almost all of the movies I men-
tioned: They were directed by men.
As someone who invests a lot of
time in studying pop culture from a
feminist perspective, I knew there
were gender barriers in the film
industry. I knew why Kathryn Big-
elow and Nora Ephron matter. But
I'd never really looked at the num-
bers behind the story.
So, I pulled out my laptop to do
some investigating. With a list of
the top 250 grossing films of 2012
in hand I highlighted the ones
helmedby female filmmakers.
Only 9 percent of the 250 were
directed by women. In the top 100,
there were only three: "Brave,"
"Zero Dark Thirty" and "The Guilt
Trip."
If you can't think of the last
movie you saw that was made by
a woman, you're not alone. Even
most of the Screen Arts and Cul-
tures students I sat down with had
to take several seconds to think
about it, and some of them are
aspiring directors themselves.
Beforethementookover
Have you heard of Dorothy
Arzner?
Neither had Nicole Gellman.
Last semester, Gellman, an
LSA junior studying SAC and also
enrolled in the School of Music,
Theatre & Dance, was given a list of
famous directors and had to choose
one to write a research paper
about. She stumbled upon Arzner,
the only woman on the list. Even
though Gellman had never heard
of her, she soon discovered that
Arzner was critical to early cinema.
"She was an open - to her col-
leagues, not to the public - lesbian
lady," Gellman said. "And that was
unheard of at the time."
Though current trends suggest
that cinema has been an old boys'
club, the industry wasn't always so
male-dominated.
Professor Caryl Flinn teaches
film theory and music at the Uni-
versity, and she's particularly
drawn to media's mix with femi-
nist theory. Feminist film theory,
which emerged in the 1970s, has
helped unearth female pioneers
integral to film's roots.
"Because cinema was a rela-
tively fledgling business and indus-
try at that point, I think they were
more open to experimentation,"
Flinn said. "And I think when the
studios became bigbusiness, there
was a little less proclivity to invest
so heavily in female talent."
Flinn noted that while this does
partially explain why there aren't
as many women seen in cinema
today as there were in the past, it's
not the whole story.

Ralko said.

The connection between
sexism onscreen and on set
Enforcing gender roles on set
goes hand-in-hand with enforc-
ing gender roles onscreen. The
Sundance report draws attention
not only to the increase in women
crews led by females, but also to
the fact that in top-grossing films
and Best Picture nominees, female
directors are more likely to put
girls and women in their films.
Lyon said she frequently thinks
about the way women are por-
trayed onscreen.
"Right now, film tells young
girls you can be a love interest
- you can be a love interest that
basically does some ass-kicking
first - but you're still a love
interest, like in 'The Matrix,' "

make gory action flicks.
Try looking up the most recent
romeom you saw. Chances are that
it was made by a man.
So, while women and men can
tell the same stories, the ways
in which they tell them differ.
While "Zero Dark Thirty" is a spy
thriller, it doesn't come with the
sexualization and reinforcements
of masculinity and femininity so
common to the genre.
Layne Simescu, an LSA junior,
agreed that the stories we see
onscreen are often dominated by
male points of view.
Just look at the slate of Best
Picture nominees this year. With
the exceptions of "Zero Dark
Thirty" and "Beasts of the South-
ern Wild," male characters con-
trol the narratives.
"Historically, movies have
always been made by males, so
we've always got that kind of
viewpoint," Simescusaid. "If more
females started making films, it
would turn the filmmaking indus-
try on its head."
"What we see projected
onscreen in the media is really
powerful in shaping the ideas
about ourselves and shaping the
world we live in," Libresco said
when asked about the importance
of increasing access to filmmak-
ing. "So, the stories we tell actu-
ally shape our experiences and
vice versa. If we don't have a full
range of voices reflected in what
we see on screen and in the media,
we don't have a full reflection of
human experience and therefore
don't have a fully equitable soci-
ety."

used in cinema to describe when

man. Think Megan Fox lifting the

In a directors' roundtable at
the Sundance Film Festival in
January, five female filmmakers
with movies in this year's festi-
val discussed the different ways
in which they capture female
sexuality onscreen. Director Liz
Garcia talked about the sex in her
Sundance submission, "The Life-
guard."
"My film really deals with
explicit female sexuality," she said
during the roundtable. "I mean,
there's cunnilingus in the movie.
I think that tells you right there
that this is a woman making the
movie."
More cracks in the ceiling
So, according to Flinn, the
glass ceiling isn't even being *
approached.
And according to Petro, women
have actually lost ground. She
said there are ebbs and flows, but
women aren't on a truly forward
trajectory in film or beyond.
"I think, today, there's a back-
lash against feminism and a back-
lash to women's rights, and you
can see it at every level," Petro
said. "I think that a new gen-
eration has to be engaged to be
attentive to reproductive rights,
let alone to access and opportuni-
ties in various workplaces. I think
that there still is incredible insti-
tutionalized sexism that needs to
be addressed. And I think there's
been a kind of complacency that
these issues are no longer issues
when, in fact, they are. And they
need continual vigilance."
The issue of complacency is
drawn out in the Sundance study.
As part of the qualitative analysis,
the researchers interviewed both
males and females in the industry.
"When we did these in-depth
interviews, we understood one
of the major barriers to chang-
ing the data is that people don't
believe there is a problem,"
Libresco said. "Now we have
data. We have numbers. There's
no more refuting that there's a
problem. So, we can point to the
data to raise awareness."
While the Sundance U.S. nar-
rative film competition boasted
50 percent female directors this
year, the Annenberg researchers
say these results have to be seen
three years consecutively before
anyone can claim real change.
While not everyone is tuned
in, the students I spoke with are
acutely aware that they are enter-
ing an industry dominated by
men. They're "nervous"; they're
"scared"; they're "intimidated."
But they still maintain an incred-
ibly positive outlook, determined
to do what they love and share it
with others.
Throughout our conversations,
it was clearthatprogresswilltake
a long, long time and it requires
sweeping changes throughout
the industry - from the way films
are financed to who we recognize
at the Academy Awards.
