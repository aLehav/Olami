NAVY YARD SHOOTING
Students safe
after deadly
. shooting in
Washington

TIRE-D?


Three 'U' students
who work in Navy
Yard not harmed in
armed attack
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily News Editor
After at 13 people were shot
and killed Monday morning
in Washington D.C.'s Navy
Yard area, three students in
the Michigan in Washington
Program who work in the area
as interns were reported to
0 be safe, according to a post on
the program's public Facebook
group.
The mass shooting began at
8:20 a.m. at Building 197, part of
the main headquarters for the
Naval Sea Systems Command,
which buys, builds and main-
tains ships, submarines and
combat systems. About 3,000
people, many civilians, work
at the headquarters, which is
located in the heart of D.C., less
than four miles from the White
House and two miles from the

Capitol.
In a Facebook post this
morning, MIW noted that
the students, who work in the
National Defense University's
Eisenhower Center in Navy
Yard, were safe and no longer at
the compound.
In an e-mail sent to MIW
alumni, a program staffer con-
firmed the students were safe,
and said each student will con-
tinue to update program lead-
ers on their whereabouts.
"Two of the three students
are at the Navy Yard but are
safe, and another, who was on
her way to work at Navy Yard,
has been detoured on her shut-
tle bus to Fort McNair, and the
bus has extra security en route
now," the e-mail said.
The gunman, killed by police,
was identified as Aaron Alexis,
a 34-year-old former Navy
reservist from Fort Worth,
Texas. Alexis, an employee at
a defense contractor, used his
pass to get into the Washington
Navy Yard and began shooting
bullets in hallways and firing
from a balcony on workers in an

CRIME
UMPD: Solici ors are
impersonating students

Police cite several
incidents of fraud
in SE Michigan
By ARIANA ASSAF
Daily StaffReporter
University Police are
warning the campus com-
munity of fraudulent solici-
tation attempts in some
southeast Michigan neigh-
borhoods.
Solicitors pretended to be
University students who need-
ed money for class trips, Uni-
versity Police said. Some said
they were part of the Commu-
nications Department, while
others said that they were
fromthe School of Music, The-
atre & Dance.
University Police Chief

Joseph Piersante said it's very
unlikely that the people going
door-to-door are legitimate
University students. He said
the University rarely, if ever,
uses door-to-door fundraising
methods.
The most common meth-
ods for University fundraising
are alumni outreach or mail-
ings. If University affiliates
do go door-to-door, they are
required to provide legitimate
University identification and
information for a contact for
follow up.
The first report, which
came to University Police
on Aug. 28, said people who
claimed to be University stu-
dents were soliciting funds
for an overseas trip to Lon-
don.
A second instance of solic-
iting was reported on Sept. 8.

This time, the solicitors were
attempting to sell magazine
subscriptions in order to fund
a Communications Depart-
ment trip.
"I don't know if that's a
coincidence or what," Pier-
sante said. "But these scams
aren't unusual. In this partic-
ular case (scammers) are tar-
geting the University."
While these particular
solicitations were door-to-
door, Piersante said that both
door-to-door and phone solici-
tors often try to raise money
for charity groups they say
benefit veterans or police sur-
vivors.
Police are not currently
aware whether or not these
solicitors have been success-
ful in raising any money, and

Postponed vote
may alter pension
make-up
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily Staff Reporter
At the AnnArbor City
Council meeting Monday
night, council members
reconsidered the Ann Arbor
Energy Commission's resolu-
tion to divest the city's pen-
sion fund of certain fossil
fuel industries, but they post-
poned a vote on the matter.
The original resolution,
proposed at the Sept. 2 meet-
ing, was one vote short of
approval. Council decided to
carry over the topic to Mon-
day's meeting to reconsider
the issue after it failed to pass
earlier in September. Coun-
cil again opened discussion
to vote on the resolution but
eventually ended in postpon-
ing the item.
The presented resolution,
which was drafted by the
Energy Commission, asked
that council recommend end-
ing any further investment
of pension funds to fossil
fuel industries. The resolu-
tion explains the city's duty
to support and maintain the
public health of residents and
also cites Ann Arbor's Cli-
mate Action Plan to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions by
25 percent by 2025.
Council members generally
expressed interest in support-
ing the resolution but were
hesitant to vote for the mea-

sure because the move could
result in a potential financial
loss for the employee pension
fund. Early on in the discus-
sion, Councilmember Mike
Anglin (D-Ward 5) reminded
the council that the resolution
was not a mandate to the pen-
sion board but still "urged"
the council to divest.
Council members dis-
cussed the viability of divest-
ing from fossil fuel industries
if the city adopted the policy.
Generally, council members
expressed concerns for the
future of pension funding.
Councilmember Stephen
Kunselman (D-Ward 3) said
he was wary of "meddling" in
the pensions, noting the eco-
nomic woes of Detroit over
the summer in part due to that
city's pension obligations.
Nancy Walker, executive
director of the employees'
retirement system, told coun-
cil members that the pension
board hasn't taken an official
position on the issue. How-
ever, a preliminary analysis of
index funds found that none
that are completely free of
fossil-fuel investment.
"Organizations, such as
pension funds, that do have
fiduciary duty really struggle
with how to balance that fidu-
ciary duty with what look like
an increase in cost," Walker
said.
Six members of the pub-
lic asked council to consider
divestment, including two
students and a University
professor. Individuals cited

Group recognized by

By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
After demand for official stu-
dent input in the search for the
next University president, a student
committee. recognized by the Uni-
versity's Board of Regents met yes-
terday for the first time.
The committee was instituted
to add a student voice to the next
president with the presidential
search that is lead by the presiden-
tial-search advisory committee,
according to Engineering graduate
student Michael Hand, a Rackham
Student Government representa-
tive and committee member. It is
comprised of 12 student leaders
from a variety of campus organiza-

Campus leaders have previously
called for student representation on
the 16-person advisory committee
that gathered to selected UMPSC's
successor. In 2002, the 16-mem-
ber committee that hired Coleman
included two students: Matt Nolan,
the student government president,
and Lisa Jackson, a then-doctoral
student.
Though the committee will gath-
er student input, the students are
not directly involved in the search.

garner student opinions on desired
qualities of the new president via

the entire student body and through

CDC sends message

ATLANTA (AP) - For the first

how many people die from drug-

than 23,000, or about as many as
those killed annually by flu.

Flash floods in
New Mexico cause
damage, takes at
least one life
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -
New Mexicans remained on high
alert Monday to possible flash
flooding as rain was expected to
continue during the next few days,
adding more runoff to already
swollen rivers and streams.
The tiny community of Mogol-
Ion in southwestern New Mexico
was isolated after weekend rains
destroyed the paved road leading
to it. About 16 residents live per-
manently in the former mining
town nestled in the mountains.
"The water washed away the
road and pretty much made it a
creek bed," said Joe Tafoya, a state
Department of Transportation
supervisor in nearby Cliff.,
Authorities were trying to get
a bulldozer "to get a road at least
scraped off to see if people want to
come out," he said.
Food, water and sanitary sup-
plies will be airlifted to the com-
munity on Tuesday, according to
Enrique Knell, a spokesman for
Gov. Susana Martinez. Details of
the mission were being worked
out, he said.
The governor traveled to sever-
al communities Monday to inspect
damage from the flooding since
last week when heavy rains inun-

dated what had been a drought-
parched state.
In eastern New Mexico, Mar-
tinez was to stop in Santa Rosa,
a community withea population
of 2,800. Local officials are seek-
ing a disaster declaration because
flooding washed out roads and
buckled pavement last week.
"It felt like the storm of the
century for the second time this
year," interim City Administra-
tor Raymond Mondragon said in
a telephone interview before the
governor's visit.
Heavy hail pounded the city
earlier in the summer, damaging
roofs that are now leaking, he said.
Officials warned of the poten-
tial of flooding because even mod-
erate rainfall can push swollen
rivers out of their banks and nor-
mally dry washes quickly fill with
fast-movingwater.
But parts of the state should get
a breather as rains Tuesday were
expected mostly in the north-cen-
tral mountains and eastern por-
tions of the state, said Christopher
Luckett, a meteorologist with the
National Weather Service in Albu-
querque.
"Comparing this week with last
week, we're definitely going to be
quieting down," Luckett said.
In the west-central community
of Grants, two schools were closed
early as a precaution in case roads
in low-lying areas become water-
covered, Grants Police Lt. John
Castaneda said. Many students
travel to and from school by bus.
Runoff is high from rains that

have pounded the area since Fri-
day.
"The water is getting into the
sewers now. We're having a lot
of backup from that," Castaneda
said.
In southwestern New Mexico,
the Gila Cliff Dwellings National
Monument remained closed.
Heavy rains raised the Gila River
by 15 feet Sunday, prompting the
closure of a road to the monument.
The monument's acting super-
intendent, Rodney Sauter, said
the river near the monument had
dropped but power to the visitor
center was knocked out after atree
fell across an electrical distribu-
tion line. He said trees and other
debris littered the river bank.
"We're still dealing with a flash
flood watch. It's better now but
we've had multiple surges since
last week," Sauter said.
However, he said the 700-year-
old cliff dwellings aren't threat-
ened because they're about 180
feet above the flood plain.
Some areas have received close
to 10 inches of rain since last
Tuesday. More than 4 inches fell
in parts of Albuquerque, marking
the wettest September on record
for the state's most populous city.
So far, one person has died
in the flooding. The body of a
53-year-old man was found over
the weekend in southern New
Mexico's Sierra County. Authori-
ties say Steven Elsley of Phoenix
died after his car was washed into
a ravine and carried away.

VERACRUZ, Mexico
34 dead in
tropical depression
The remnants of Hurricane
Ingrid and Tropical Storm Man-
uel drenched northeastern and
southwestern Mexico with tor-
rential rains Monday, flooding
towns and cities, cutting high-
ways and setting off landslides in
a national emergency that federal
authorities said had caused at least
34 deaths.
The Mexican government said
the country had not seen a similar
weather crisis since 1958, when
the country was simultaneously
hit by two tropical storms, also on
separate coasts.
The governor of the Gulf Coast
state of Veracruz announced that
12 people died when a landslide
smashed into a bus traveling
through the town of Altotonga,
about 40 miles northwest of the
state capital.
More than 23,000 people fled
their homes in the state due to
heavy rains spawned by Ingrid,
and 9,000 went to emergency
shelters. At least 20 highways
and 12 bridges had been dam-
aged, the state's civil protection
authority said.

U.N. confirms
poison gas
was used in
Syrian city

The Costa Concordia ship lies on its side on the Tuscan Island of Giglio, Italy,Monday. An international team of engi-
neers is trying a never-before attempted strategy to set upright the luxury liner.
C onc ordiafi nally upright

Ill-fated cruise
ship upright after
19-hour operation
GIGLIO ISLAND, Italy (AP)
- Engineers have declared the
crippled Costa Concordia cruise
ship completely upright after
a 19-hour operation to pull it
from its side where it capsized
last year off Tuscany.
Shortly after 4 a.m. Tuesday,
a foghorn rang out on Giglio
Island and the head of Italy's
Civil Protection agency, Franco
Gabrielli, announced that the
ship had reached vertical and
that the operation to rotate it
was complete.
Applause rang out among
firefigters in the tent where
Gabrielli and other project engi-
neers made the announcement.
Officials said there was no
apparent pollution in the waters
around the ship as a result of the
operation.
Using a vast system of steel
cables and pulleys, maritime
engineers on Monday gingerly
winched the massive hull of the
Costa Concordia off the reef
where the cruise ship capsized
near an Italian island in Janu-
ary 2012 and were poised to set
it upright in the middle of the
night.
After 15 hours of slower-
than-expected progress in
pulling the heavily listing lux-
ury liner to an upright position,
engineers said they finally hit

the tipping point they eagerly
were awaiting.
Shortly before midnight, the
Concordia was raised by 25
degrees -- after that, engineers
said, the effect of gravity start-
ed giving the rotation a boost.
Then engineers quit operat-
ing the pulleys, and by using
remote controls, carefully
began opening valves to let
seawater start filling huge bal-
last tanks that had been welded
onto the already exposed side.
The weight of the water in the
tanks helped pull the cruise
liner up much faster.
"We're in the final phase of
rotation," said Franco Gabrielli,
the Italian government official
who is overseeing the opera-
tion. "We have passed the 24
degree mark and now are filling
the tanks with water," he told
journalists early Tuesday.
Originally, engineers had
been confident complete rota-
tion might take as little as 10
hours, and be reached by early
evening Monday.
But the timetable quickly
went off plan.
First, an unpredicted early
morning thunderstorm pushed
back the start time. Then the
wreck resisted for three hours
before it allowed itself to be
wrested off the jagged rocks
that were embedded into one
side of the hull after the Con-
cordia had hit another reef
close to Giglio Island's coast-
line, took on water through a
70-meter-long (76-yard-long)

gash, and eventually capsized
a few hundred meters (yards)
away onto another reef.
There it lay on its side until
Monday's daring engineering
operation pulled it free.
"Things are going like they
should, but on a timetable
that is dragging out," Gabrielli
chief of Italy's Civil Protection
Agency, said earlier on Mon-
day.
Never before has such an
enormous cruise ship been
righted. Salvage workers strug-
gled to overcome obstacle after
obstacle as they slowly inched
toward their goal of raising the
crippled ship 65 degrees to the
upright position.
At one point, some of the
cables dragging the ship's hull
upright went slack, forcing
engineers to climb the hull to
fix them.
The Concordia itself didn't
budge for the first three hours
after the operation began,
engineer Sergio Girotto told
reporters.
The initial operation to
lift the ship moved it just 3
degrees toward vertical. After
10 hours, the crippled ship had
edged upward by just under 13
degrees, a fraction of what had
been expected.
After some 6,000 tons of
force were applied - using a
complex system of pulleys and
counterweights - Girotto said
"we saw the detachment" of the
ship's hull from the reef thanks
to undersea cameras.

Rockets with
chemical agent
found at military
base
UNITED NATIONS (AP) -
Careful not to blame either side
for a deadly chemical weapon
attack, U.N. inspectors reported
Mondaythatrocketsloaded with
the nerve agent sarin had been
fired from an area where Syr-
ia's military has bases, but said
the evidence could have been
manipulated in the rebel-con-
trolled stricken neighborhoods.
The U.S., Britain and France
jumped on evidence in the
report - especially the type of
rockets, the composition of the
sarin agent, and trajectory of the
missiles - to declare that Presi-
dent Bashar Assad's government
was responsible.
Russia, Syria's closest ally,
called the investigators' findings
"deeply disturbing," but said it
was too early to draw conclu-
sions. The Syrian government's
claims that opposition forces
were responsible for the attack
"cannot be simply shrugged
off," Russian Ambassador Vitaly
Churkin insisted.
The conclusions represented
the first official confirmation by
impartial scientific experts that
chemical weapons were used in
Syria's civil war, but the inspec-
tors' limited mandate barred
them from identifying who
was responsible for the Aug. 21
attack.
"This is a war crime," U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
told the Security Council when
he presented the report. "The
results are overwhelming and
indisputable. The facts speak for
themselves."
Ban called it "the most signifi-
cant confirmed use of chemical
weapons against civilians since
Saddam Hussein used them" in
Halabja, Iran, in 1988, and "the
worst use of weapons of mass
destruction in the 21st century."
The deep division between
Western backers of rebels seek-
ing to overthrow Assad and Rus-
sian and Chinese supporters of
the regime has paralyzed the
U.N. Security Council since the
Syrian conflict began 21/2 years
ago.
Eventhoughthe UnitedStates
and Russia agreed Saturday on
the framework to put Syria's
chemical weapons stockpile and
precursors under international
control for future destruction,
their top diplomats were at odds
Monday over a new Security
Council resolution that would
make the deal legally binding
- and whether there should be
a reference to possible military
enforcement if Syria doesn't
comply.
After months of negotia-
tions, the U.N. inspectors went
to Syria to visit the sites of three
alleged chemical attacks earlier
this year and were in the capital
of Damascus on Aug. 21 when
reports and videos began surfac-
ing of a shelling attack in which
victims experienced shortness
of breath, disorientation, blurred
vision, nausea, vomiting, weak-

ness and a loss of consciousness.
They finally gained access
to three towns where the Aug.
21 attack occurred, and on one
occasion their convoy was hit
by sniper fire, but the inspectors
were nonetheless able to collect
a large amount of material and
talk to survivors and witnesses.
"The environmental, chemi-
cal and medical samples we have
collected provide clear and con-
vincing evidence that surface-
to-surface rockets containing
the nerve agent sarin were used
... in the Ghouta area of Damas-
cus," their report said.
"The conclusion is that chem-
ical weapons have been used in
the ongoing conflict between
the parties in the Syrian Arab
Republic, also against civilians,
including children, on a relative-

ly large scale," they said. "This
result leaves us with the deepest
concern."
The rebels and their West-
ern and Arab supporters have
blamed Assad's regime for the
attack in the rebel-controlled
area of Ghouta. The Syrian gov-
ernment insists the attack was
carried out by rebels. The U.N.
report mentions the Ghouta
areas of Ein Tarma, Moadami-
yeh and Zamalka, all of which
were featured in videos of vic-
tims that emerged after the
attack.
The U.N. report did not men-
tion how many people were
killed in the Aug. 21 attack. The
U.S. says more than 1,400, but
other death toll estimates have
been far lower.
The report cited the following
evidence to support its conclu-
sions:
- Rockets and fragments
were found to contain sarin.
"Several surface-to-surface
rockets capable of delivering sig-
nificant chemical payloads were
identified and recorded at the
investigated sites,"the investiga-
tors said.
- Close to the impact sites,
in the area where people were
affected, inspectors collected
30 soil and environmental sam-
ples - far more than any previ-
ous U.N. investigation - and in
a majority of the samples, "the
environment was found to be
contaminated by sarin," its by-
products, and "other relevant
chemicals, such as stabilizers."
- Blood, urine and hair sam-
ples from 34 patients who had
signs of poisoning by a chemical
compound provided "definitive
evidence of exposure to satin
by almost all of the survivors
assessed."
- More than 50 interviews
with survivors and health care
workers "provided ample cor-
roboration of the medical and
scientific results."
"The large-scale use of sarin,
the direction of the rocket
attacks, and kind of rockets used
in the attacks all point to use by
Assad's forces beyond reason-
able doubt," said Daryl Kimball,
executive director of the Wash-
ington-based Arms Control
Association.
"The conclusions reached by
the United States and European
governments would now appear
to have received corroboration
by a source the Russians and
Syrians will have trouble dis-
crediting," Kimball said.
The inspectors described
the rockets used to disperse the
sarin as a variant of an M14 artil-
lery rocket, with either an origi-
nal or an improvised warhead.
The report said the rockets that
hit two of the suburbs - Zamal-
ka and Ein Tarma - were fired
from the northwest, but it didn't
say who launched them.
The inspectors did not pro-
vide a location for the rockets'
launch site, but Qassioun Moun-
tain, where the Syrian military is
known to have bases, is roughly
northwest of both suburbs.
"This was no cottage indus-
try use of chemical weapons,"
Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark
Lyall Grant said.
"To put it in perspective,

just on those rocket samples
that they were able to examine,
they had a payload of a total of
350 liters, which is 35 times the
amount that was used in the
Tokyo subway" in 1995, he said,
adding that the inspectors also
confirmed "that the quality of
the sarin was superior" both to
that used in Tokyo and also to
what was used by Iraq against
Iran.
U.S. Ambassador Samantha
Power noted that chief inspector
Ake Sellstrom said the weapons
"were professionally made."
"It defies logic that the oppo-
sition would have infiltrated the
regime-controlled area to fire on
opposition-controlled areas,"
she said. "Only the regime could
have carried out this large-scale
attack."

Egyptian army officers petition
military chief to run for president

el-Sissi responsible
for ousting Morsi
amid unrest
in nation
CAIRO (AP) - A group of
professionals and former army
officers launched Monday a
petitionurging Egypt's military
chief, who ousted the country's
first freely elected leader, to
run for president, highlighting
the yearning for a strongman to
take charge after nearly three
years of turmoil.
The campaign for Gen.
Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi is
propped up by a pervasive per-
sonality cult, based on his suc-
cess in uprooting an Islamist
ruling elite. Still, there has
been a faint pushback from new
political groups calling for a
civilian leader for the nascent
democracy -despite little pub-
lic tolerance for criticism of the
military and a deepening sense
of nationalism.
In his one major political
speech after removing Islamist
President Mohammed Morsi on
July 3, el-Sissi said he had no
political aspirations. Soon after,
a military spokesman denied
reports the general would run
for office. But the spokesman
added that nothing would stop
el-Sissi from doing so if he
retired.
The clamor for him to run in
presidential elections expected
in early 2014 has only grown,
demonstrating the dramatic
seesawing Egypt has undergone
since the 2011 revolution top-
pled autocrat Hosni Mubarak,

a former military man. In part
the calls are fueled by a pow-
erful anti-Islamist fervor after
Morsi's one year in office, when
bitterness grew over what many
saw as attempts by his Muslim
Brotherhood to monopolize
power and take the country in a
more extremist direction.
State media and sympathetic
television stations have helped
fan the el-Sissi sentiment. Pop
songs praising him and the mil-
itary flood the airwaves. Post-
ers of el-Sissi in his dark glasses
and military cap are plastered
around the streets. Videos of
him addressing troops or train-
ing with them have become a
staple on TV.
In the upscale Cairo district
of Garden City, sweets shop
owner Bahira Galal says she
has been doing a brisk business
with her new chocolates bear-
ing el-Sissi's picture.
"I support el-Sissi in my own
way, especially after millions
went out in the streets, every-
one in their own way, support-
ing him," she said.
Millions turned out for
protests that began June 30
demanding Morsi's removal,
prompting el-Sissi to oust the
Islamist leader. Morsi's sup-
porters have continued protests
demanding his reinstatement,
even as a security crack-
down has jailed thousands of
Islamists. Detained since his
ouster, Morsi faces trial on
charges of inciting the killing
of protesters, and prosecutors
are preparing other charges,
including insulting the judi-
ciary.
El-Sissi has said he was
only acting in response to the

people's demands, dismissing
charges of orchestrating a coup.
El-Sissi installed an interim,
civilian government that is pav-
ing the way for elections.
El-Sissi has cultivated a pop-
ular image for himself - that
of a strongman who acted to
save the nation and, at the same
time, a soft-spoken figure with
the interests of the people at
heart. That has helped restore
the prestige of the military
after the much criticized peri-
od when generals held direct
power for more than a year
and a half after Mubarak's fall.
Those generals came from an
older generation than el-Sissi
and have since been shunted
aside.
The new petition campaign
announced Monday brands
itself "complete your good
deed" - urging el-Sissi to take
the next step and run. Orga-
nizer Rifai Nasrallah, a judge,
said the goal was to collect 30
million signatures to convince
the general to give in to "popu-
lar will."
"Don't forget that you told
the Egyptian people to ask and
you will respond. Here we are
asking you to be president of
Egypt," Nasrallah said at the
launch gathering at a Cairo
hotel, addressing el-Sissi.
The campaign is modeled
after Tamarod, or Rebel, which
spearheaded anti-Morsi pro-
tests after claiming to have
gathered 22 million signatures
demanding his ouster.
Younan Gerges, who is run-
ning the campaign in Cairo,
denied it is funded by security
agencies or the military, or even
major businessmen.

lans to develop a new graduate student residence hall were
met with potential resistance from some graduate students at
a town hall meeting on Sept. 11. University officials spoke with
graduate students at a forum Wednesday dedicated to discussing what
will likely be called the Munger Residence Hall, a new dormitory fund-
ed by a $110-million donation from University alum Charles Munger,
who also bankrolled a similar residence hall at Stanford University.
Despite enthusiasm from the administration, the building's seven-res-
ident unit layout and potential prices disenchanted graduate students
in attendance. However, when these criticisms were voiced, E. Royster
Harper, vice president of student affairs, emphasized Munger's own
intention with the dormitory, and the administration's need to respect
those wishes. Moving forward, the University needs to do a better job
balancing the wishes of donors with student needs.

still funny. Last
Thursday night,
as I was partak-
ing in this particular indulgence, I
stumbled upon a somewhat more
serious - though still humorously
written - article about sorority
rush at the University of Alabama.
According to this story,which
links to a report published in The
Crimson white, Alabama's stu-
dent newspaper, two black women
failed to receive a bid at any soror-
ity this fall, reportedly because of
their race.
Upon seeing the title to this par-
ticular story, I quickly concluded
exactly what I was about to read.
Because of some sort of de facto
racism, all of the sororities at Ala-
bama refused to bid any black girls
and the conservative-leaning TFM
writer was going to conjure some
typical response dismissing all
claims of racism more complex than
a Klan member burning a cross.
Instead, I was very pleasantly
surprised.
What actually happened was
many of the top sororities at Ala-
bama saw these two girls as highly
qualified candidates for membership
- noting their high levels of involve-
ment, great performance in school
and prestigious families. As they
began the bid process though, their

When the University broke the news of
Munger's donation in April - the largest gift
to the University prior to Stephen Ross's early
September donation - administrators outlined
a vision for a complex that would bringtogether
students from different academic backgrounds
in an attempt to "make graduate study less iso-
lated," as University President Mary Sue Cole-
man put it. Munger's well-intentioned mission,
however, has begun to outwweigh the interests
of students themselves.
OneofthewaystheMungerplannedoncre-
ating this interdisciplinary community was
by building seven-resident apartments with
shared living space. At the town-hall session,
however, graduate students - the targeted
tenants of the complex - reacted negatively
to the "experimental" concept, arguing that
this attempt at creating community-style liv-
ing isn't the right fit for upper-level students.
Graduate studies often require intense focus,
and students in graduate programs are closer
to starting families than their undergraduate
counterparts. Despite the attempt at build-
ing community, seven-person housing units
might not be the most productive way to fos-
ter the dialogue that Munger wants to build.
The price oflivinginthe residencehallis also
concerning - especially considering students
would be sharing space with so many people.

Current price approximations for the resi-
dence hall are about $1,000 per month. While
this price might keep the University competi-
tive with the recent rise of luxury apartments
in Ann Arbor, it's far from an affordable option
for graduate students, especially those already
managingstudent-loan debt.
"When you're still working from, in a lot
of cases, a research stipend or something like
that, you have to be pretty frugal with what
you're spending on housing," Rackham stu-
dent Michael Hand, Rackham Student Gov-
ernment representative, said at the meeting.
In light of rising housing prices in the city, the
University's role in housing should be provid-
ing an affordable option. The vision of the
donor shouldn't impede the ability to finance
students' education.
The University has received many signifi-
cant donations in the past year, from Ross's
recentedonationto gifts fromthe Zell family. Of
course, the University community is grateful
for the continued support from alumni; how-
ever, these donations are offered and planned
long before they're announced to the entire
University. Instead of focusing on unveiling
these donations with pomp and circumstance,
the University should be working toward
bridging the gap between donors and students
long before building plans are released.

Hungry for more-

A s I walked down South University
Avenue yesterday, I counted one liquor
store, two pizza parlors, four bars and
countless restaurants.
State Street didn't look
much different either.
Despite what seems
like an abundance of food
options, stories of hunger
are an all-too-real, but
rarely discussed, realityx
on campus. Student Food ZOE
Co., a pop-up produce
stand seeking to provide STAHL
fresh, affordable fruits
and vegetables to the
student body, conducted a survey in 2012 of
grocery shopping and eating habits among
students. According to their research, 15,000
Michigan students are considered "food
insecure," meaning students were "unable
to acquire adequate food ... because they
had insufficient money and other resources
for food." Whether that's because the gro-
cery stores within walking distance are too
expensive or the more
affordable supermar-
kets are difficult to Stories of

remains unclear. are an all-i
Either way, asa result
nearly 12.6 percent of reality ont
those considered food
insecure frequently
experience hunger and
many others rely on empty-calorie meals like
ramen and Easy Mac.
The University isn't alone, though: Food
insecurity plagues other campuses across the
country. Michigan State University, San Diego
City College, University of Central Florida and
a host of others have all identified hunger as
an issue. However, unlike the University, these
schools, along with University of California,
Los Angeles, Grand Rapids Community Col-
lege and University of Michigan, Dearborn,
have been proactive, starting either food
banks or free bag-lunch programs in response

to high hunger rates among their students.
Given the University's concern for students'
health and well-being, we should do the same.
The University has already committed to
providing healthier food options by start-
ing the Marmers' Market in the Michigan
Union and sourcing more nutritional options
in University-run stores, like U-go's and Pier-
pont Commons. Unfortunately, these options
are not always at student-friendly prices.
Considering the magnitude of the problem,
the University should embark on a study to
identify the reasons for the University's high
food-insecurity rates. Figuring out the barri-
ers to food access is a first step. In an e-mail
interview, Margot Finn, a lecturer of food
studies at the University, asks critical ques-
tions: "Is it too hard to get on the city bus
routes that go to grocery stores? Are bikes
and zip cars too expensive? ... (Are) stores like
(Revive) and the People's Food Co-op either
too expensive or also too inconvenient? ... Is it
because real estate near campus is too expen-
sive, so they'd have to charge Babo prices?
Is there simply not enough student demand
- between dorm cafeterias
and the ubiquity of relatively
hunger cheap prepared food?"
Once the University has
too-real defined the scope of the
problem, it will be better
campus. equipped to assess options
and possible solutions,
such as a food bank, a free
bag lunch program or ride-
shares to the grocery store. I trust that such a
research-oriented and innovative university
will come up with a creative and multi-facet-
ed solution.
I do realize the problem is systemic of
something larger - rising income inequality
and tuition rates that leave students strapped
for cash and forced to push basic needs to the
back burner. Let's hope the University can
start to make a difference.

more likely to opt out of a high-
paying job in order to spend more
time with their families and we
have alarmingly low voter turn-
out. The high point of our political
involvement was the 2008 presi-
dential election, only to swing the
complete opposite direction in
2012: utter apathy.
This isn't to say social activism
has completely disappeared in
college students. The recent pas-
sage of tuition equality for undoc-
umented Michigan residents and
veterans demonstrates the stu-
dent body's ability to endure and
affect change.
But the pressure to be involved
with local issues feels like a step-
ping stone to bigger - possibly
paying - things. A resume booster,
where affecting real change is sim-
ply a bonus.
Prof. Scott Campbell and Asso-
ciate Prof. Stephen Ward recently
commented on the professionalism
that activism has taken on at the
University in an interview with
The Michigan Daily. The wild, out-
of-control protests of the 60s were
sacrificed, but not necessarily the
social justice.
However, it's possible that the
lack of disorder and disruption of
these protests has lengthened the

time it takes for governments to
take notice and finally change poli-
cy. Simply put, it's easy to ignore an
online petition or Facebook group,
even if it's signed by 20,000 people.
A march or sit-in of that magni-
tude, however, would require gov-
ernment or police action and make
national front pages.
Many theories have circulated
about the Millennial generation's
lack of motivation to take part
in national issues. Is it the hours
we spent with the television and
Internet? Is it our supposedly nar-
cissistic obsession with Facebook,
Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram?
No. I would argue something
else entirely.
Our generation grew up in the
era of 'zero tolerance.' Every school
guidebook, classroom syllabus and
summer camp information e-mail
used some form of the phrase.
There was zero tolerance for bul-
lying, swearing, drugs and alcohol,
cheating, name calling, separating
from the group or pretty much any
rebellious behavior. Zero tolerance
is a vague statement. It allows an
individual to imagine the worst
possible outcome from violating
the rules. But it's understood that
zero tolerance doesn't meana chat
with the school principal and a call
to your parents.
It means losing everything.
This culture of zero tolerance
created a space that was unforgiv-
ing. One mistake and you were
screwed for life. Today's youth are
afraid to make mistakes and to be
rebellious because of this culture.
We just aren't willing to risk every-
thing we've worked for to attend a
political protest that'll most likely
end up with someone in jail and
make little progress anyway. If
we're going to break the rules, it's
going to be a fun way to blow off
some steam. We were taught one

strike and you're out, and that's
how we're living ourlives.
Another factor is the economic
downturn. Blemishes on a record
can only hurt you in the uphill
battle of getting a job during a time
of depressingly low job opportu-
nities. Accordingto an article in
The Wall Street Journal the rate
of unemployment for adults under
25 was 15.6 percent in August -
two and half times more than the
unemployment rate for 25 and
older. According to a CNBC article,
2012 and 2013 college graduates
will earn less over the next decade
than before the recession hit.
Even bleaker is the rate of
underemployed college graduates.
According to the Economic Policy
Institute, 19.1 percent of college
graduates were underemployed in
2012.
We've been conditioned to think
that any demerit on our record will
haunt us for the rest of our lives.
There's no patience for mistakes
of youth and there are too many
well-educated people for too few
jobs. With so many other quali-
fied, if not perfect, candidates, why
would any business risk taking the
applicant with a record or who had
a meeting with the dean?
While the parental genera-
tion may want youth population
to stand up, many are more con-
cerned with their individual child's
well-being and success than global
well-being. Few parents would
condone their child's choice to
drop out of school to join Occupy
Wall Street, but many praised the
youth for finally standing up for
something. It's a catch-22 that we,
as Millennials, are unable to avoid
- disappointing our parents and
throwing away our future or be
labeled dispirited and unpatriotic.

SHOOTING

atrium below.
The reason for the deadly
shooting is still unknown,
investigators said. It is not yet
clear if this was an act of ter-
rorism.
For much of the day, author-
ities said they were looking
for a possible second attacker
who may have been dressed
in an olive-drab military-style
uniform. But by late Monday
night, officials said they were
convinced the attack was the

work of a lone gunman, and
the security lockdown around
the area was eased.
The attack came four years
after Army psychiatrist Maj.
Nidal Hasan killed 13 people
at Fort Hood in what he said
was an effort to save the lives
of Muslims overseas. He was
convicted last month and sen-
tenced to death.
In addition to those killed,
eight people were hurt - three
of them shot and wounded,
according to the mayor. Those
three were a police officer and
two female civilians, authori-
ties said. They are all expected

to survive.
The decesased ranged in
age from 46 to 73, according
to the mayor. A number of the
victims were civilian employ-
ees and contractors, rather
than active-duty military
personnel, the police chief
said.
Monday's incident was the
deadliest mass shooting on
a military installation in the
United States since the trag-
edy at Fort Hood, Texas, in
2009.

"perfect" environment for more
research, he said.
The program will use the
laboratories in the building
to advance research to benefit
the public, including research in
medicine, nuclear measurements
related to homeland security,
developing safer nuclear reactors
and nuclear non-proliferation,
among other projects.
Funded by the College of Engi-
neering, the project will produce
an average of 18 on-site construc-
tion jobs, and will be designed
by architectural firm Smith-
GroupJJR. The design process is
scheduled to begin soon, and will
be approved by the board at a later
date.
Regents to approve schematic
design of Munger Graduate
Residence project
Last April, the board announced
the construction of a new resi-
dence hall for graduate students
funded in part by a $110-million
donation from University alum
Charles Munger, vice president of
Berkshire Hathaway.
In a communication to the
regents, Slottow and E. Royster
Harper, vice president of student
affairs, wrote that the building will
be eight-stories tall to accommo-
date approximately 630 students
"in an apartment-style layout."
The building - located on the site
of the current Thompson Street
Parking Structure and former
Blimpy Burger restaurant - will
cost approximately $185 million,
funded largely by Munger and the
rest by Housing resources. With
an average of 264 on-site construc-
tion jobs, the building will be com-
plete in the summer of 2015.
At a forum hosted by Rackham
Student Government on Sept. 11,
some graduate students expressed
their concerns about the new resi-
dence hall's schematic design and
living costs. Although the forum

produced mixed reviews of the
hall, Harper said the University
hopes to stay true to Munger's
vision for his flagship project.
"If this were 'just us' and the
funding were 'just us,' we would
have some different kinds of
options," Harper said. "ButI think
when you are in a partnership ...
you make some agreements about
what you're goingto offer, then we
have to honor those agreements."
School of Education
renovations to be approved
In a communication to the
regents, Slottow recommended
approval of the renovation of the
School of Education, which was
built in 1923.
The project will improve infra-
structure and functionality of
approximately 8,300 square feet
of space, including new heating,
ventilation and air conditioning
systems, bathroom facilities and
fire alarm systems.
Funded from investment pro-
ceeds, the project will cost $13.6
million andwillbe designedbythe
architectural firm SHW Group.
In an effort to minimize disrup-
tion of the academic schedule, the
construction is set for completion
in fall 2015.
Division ofStudent Affairs
to be renamed
In a communication to the
regents, Harper requested to
change her division's name from
the Division of Student Affairs to
the Division of Student Life.
Harper wrote that the change
would represent the department's
participation and work toward
every aspect of a student's life,
including learning experiences,
development, health, social jus-
tice, support and education, among
other services.
Compared to the current name,
the new title "resonates and
excites" University students, staff
and parents, Harper said in the
communicaiton.
"The clarity of the new name

will maximize success in the cur-
rent capital campaign and launch
future efforts to connect, inspire
and build community both within
and beyond the University," Harp-
er said in the communication.
If approved, the new name will
be effective on Oct. 1.
Jerry May, vice president of
development, to detail year's
philanthropic success
In early September, Judy Mal-
colm, the Office of Development's
senior director of executive com-
munications, said in an interview
May will deliver a speech about
the fiscal figures for 2013.
Malcolm said the University
has seen a record-breaking num-
ber of donations under $25,000
over the past year. With the Uni-
versity's fifth capital campaign
coming up, Malcolm said any
donation, whether it be compa-
rable to University alum Stephen
Ross's recent historic $200-mil-
lion gift or $10, invests in the Uni-
versity's future.
University to sell land to NSF
International
The University is set to sell 51
acres of land east of US-23 and
south of Plymouth Road in the Ann
Arbor Technology area.
According to a communication
issued by Slottow, the regents will
consider selling 51 acres of vacant
land for $3.52 million to NSF
International, a non-profit body
verifies if products meet public
health and safety standards. The
net proceeds from the sale will go
towards the general fund.
NSF hopes to expand their facil-
ity on Dixboro Road, which lies
underneath the vacant property.
The University and NSF have
worked together for nearly 70
years. The nonprofit has contribut-
ed scholarships, donations and an
endowed chair for the department
in the School of Pubic Health.
If the board approves the sale,
officials hope to close the sale by
Oct. 31.

Innovative
residence hall to
house 630 students
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
Daily StaffReporter
Inside the dusty window of
the old Blimpy Burger loca-
tion on South Division Avenue
hangs a sign thanking custom-
ers for their patronage during
the restaurant's 60-year run.
Now fenced off, the build-
ing and four other neighboring
properties recently purchased
by the University will be pre-
pared to be demolished to make
way for a $185-million graduate
residence hall funded in part by
a $110-million gift from Univer-
sity alum Charles Munger.
A leaflet distributed to resi-
dents living on Thompson and
Division streets near the site
informed students of approach-
ing construction days.
"Please be advised that
demolition and construction
activities are going to be com-
mencing this week in the block
north of Madison," the pam-
phlet stated. "Fencing will be
installed and demolition of
the existing structures along
Division and Madison will
take place shortly thereafter.
We will have further informa-

tion in early October regard-
ing construction details for the
new Munger Graduate Housing
building."
Munger, along with Ste-
phen Ross and Helen Zell,
have been part of a spate of
major donors in the past few
years who have donated large
sums to endow specific schol-
arships and programs, as well
as fund the construction of
campus buildings.
Housing resources will pro-
vide $75 million for the proj-
ect. If construction stays on
schedule, the building will be
completed in summer 2015.
Schematic designs will be
unveiledbefore the University's
Board of Regents at their meet-
ing on Thursday.
The new residence hall
will house 630 graduate stu-
dents - and potentially visit-
ing faculty - in an eight-story,
370,000-square-foot building.
The building will be split into
groups of seven individual bed-
rooms and bathrooms joined
to a shared kitchen and living
space meant to encourage col-
laboration between graduate
students.
Parking will not be provided
to future residents.
Graduate students have
expressed dismay about the
purported cost - about $1,000
per month - and the proposed

layout of the rooms.
In an interview after
Wednesday's forum, Hank
Baier, associate vice president
for faculties and operations,
and E. Royster Harper, vice
president of student affairs,
said while the residence hall
was not intended to meet the
needs of all graduate students,
they stressed that they would
work on meeting some con-
cerns, such as cost.
"We recognize that this is
not for everyone, but (we) think
it will be a wild success," Baier
said.
However, Harper added that
there were limitations to what
could be changed because the
project featured the heavy per-
sonal involvement of Munger,
who had previously funded
the construction of a graduate
residence hall at Stanford Uni-
versity.
"Certainly he has been
engaged, certainly he has influ-
enced our thinking ... I would
say he has been a good partner,"
Harper said.
With construction begin-
ning, the University can begin
looking forward to the comple-
tion of a long cycle of renova-
tions and building projects
on its residence halls that has
sought to make them competi-
tive with the offerings of other
top universities.

COUNCIL
From Page 1
regarding tobacco and apartheid,
and the symbolic effort to combat
climate change.
LSA sophomore Laura Hobbs
spoke to the council in support
of the resolution, noting similar
divestment efforts in college towns
on the West Coast.
"This commitment sends a
message not just to stakehold-
ers nationwide, but also to the
students in these communities,"
Hobbs said to the council. "By
agreeing to divest from fossil fuels,
the city is showing students that
Ann Arbor recognizes the harmful
effects of climate change."

Business Prof. Kai Petainen pre-
sented a paper to council inewhich
he cautioned the proposed divest-
ment.
"You're basically selling out
of an entire sector and the fifth-
largest sector in that market is
that sector" Petainen said. "If you
do that, it means that index funds,
which hold that sector, can't hold
that sector anymore."
Petainen said other risks includ-
ed increased risk for the fund over-
all and increased fees. While the
original resolution claimed the
divestment would pose "little or no
risk to return on investments," Pet-
ainen said the study was too small
in scale to accurately represent the
Ann Arbor employee pensions.
Councilmember Sally Petersen

(D-Ward 2) suggested that,vrather
than divesting, council invest in
clean energy and enhance green
initiatives in other areas other
than pensions.
"If they were to go with the
recommendation, I feel strongly
that it would be inconsistent with
this City Council's priority for fis-
cal discipline," Petersen said in an
interview during a break. "Given
that our pension fund is already
underfunded, that cost would cre-
ate further liabilities."
After much discussion, the
council moved to postpone until
the pension board had a chance to
evaluate the proposal. The move-
ment to postpone passed, and the
council will readdress the issue at
its second meeting in October.

Roots, Costello
team up on 'Ghost'

Don't let the machine tell
you what movies to watch

Unlikely pairing
crafts swelling
'Wise Up Ghost'
By HANNAH WEINER
For the Daily
If they both weren't so hip, the
collaboration between a 59-year-
old singer-songwriter and a hip-
hop band might
seem absurdly B
hilarious.
Luckily, Wise Wise Up
Up Ghost, the Ghost
collaborative
album by Elvis The Roots and
Costello and Elvis Costello
The Roots, fea-
tures two of the Blue Note
coolest musi-
cians from separate corners of the
music industry.
The music is smooth, funky,
mostly what you'd predict from
the combination of their sounds.
Suave guitars, Costello's charac-
teristic vocals, sexy saxophones
and driving beats are all reminis-
cent of a Curtis Mayfield-era soul
album. The novelty of the col-
laboration doesn't wear off for the
entire 56 minutes, so they had to
be doing something right.
Career-wise for Costello, the
album proves to be imaginative
and progressive; pairing up with
a black hip-hop band from Phila-
delphia directs his appeal toward
a younger audience. But Costello
isn't entirely new to the world of
black music genres: His music
has always been laced with reg-
gae and Motown. So for an artist
that has been around since the
1970s, this matchup revives his
discography after 2010's medio-
cre National Ransom. Regardless
of whether this choice was purely
business orjust plain fun, Costello
and The Roots made a wise deci-
sion. Besides - what else do you
do when you've been making
music as long as these guys have?

"Bet you never expected this."
The only thing missing that
would make Wise Up Ghost stel-
lar: Black Thought's rap. What the
album could be (an experimental
concept album like Undun) far
exceeds what it actually became.
For fans of these two artists,
the fantasy of Black Thought's
rhymes atop Costello's weird
lyricism sparked excitement. But
after perusing the songs, listeners
may feel cheapened, cheated -
The Roots's presence seems less
vocal than originally perceived.
Costello undeniably outshines the
band; in an interview, he claimed
outright that it's not his "hip-hop
album." Which, on some level,
pardons the album from its utter
lack of transparent hip hop.
However, at some points,
Costello enters a hip-hop-esque
form of singing; he exaggerates
the rhymes on lines like, "Just
because I don't speak the lan-
guage doesn't mean I'm blind to
the threat / But I thought there
was more to forgiveness than
we conveniently forget." Sure,
it's not rapping (that might be
a lot to ask of Costello), but it's

charged with a hip-hop atti-
tude, and songs like "Stick Out
Your Tongue" and "Refuse To
Be Saved" do feature stabbing
words and lyric-heavy rhythms.
Even the album art makes a nod
toward the poeticism of Wise Up
Ghost - mimicking the poetry
editions of old City Lights book
jackets, like Allen Ginsberg's
"Howl."
What's present on the album:
an uninhibited and animated
Elvis Costello. Layered atop
cinematic swelling strings and
sharp syncopated drumbeats,
Costello croons poetically about
politics, among other topics. The
songs are gritty, moody and full
of humidity - a thick, instru-
mental, vintage soul album
infused with subtle hip hop.
Though, the album as a whole is
unremarkable and a far cry from
the artists' genius works, such as
The Roots's Undun or Costello's
My Aim Is True. But for those
interested in hearing Costello
pontificate over Questlove's
beats, Wise Up Ghost presents a
quality product.

Blandness trumps
beat on'MGM '

Not enough thought
put into latest effort
from indie group
By ERIKA HARWOOD
Daily Arts Writer
It would be far reaching to clas-
sify MGMT as conventional. After
all, they did play what could poten-
tially he the
world's largest B
cowbell on "Let-
terman" a few MGMT
weeks ago. Yet
there is a fine MGMT
line between Columbia
cutting-edge
experimenta-
tion and an unsettling lack of
focus, and the latter seems to pre-
side over the group's latest self-
titled effort.
"Alien Days" starts the album
off with the intriguing distorted,
childlike voice (perhaps actually
the voice of a child), eventually
joined by singer Andrew VanWyn-
garden who leads the song into a
primarily acoustic sounding track
that resonates more as an enthusi-
asm-lacking filler. VanWyngarden
softlymutters the lyrics behind the
halfhearted instrumentation.
Many of the songs tend to mis-
lead with strong openings like
on "Cool Song No. 2" and "Astro-
Mancy," which start off with dis-
tinct, individualized beats, yet
once they get going falter into the
same trap that plagues the rest
of the album once they get going.
After VanWyngarden begins his
unenthusiastic lyricism, the tracks
become dull and uninspired.
Songs blending together can be
a useful trope for creating some-
thing more cohesive and even
coherent, yet it works in the exact

FELICITY?

opposite way for MGMT. The
second half of the album melts
together to the point where the
songs become completely indis-
cernible. Repetitive melodies and
the group's attempt at making
bizarre new-age sounds become
tiresome after about seven min-
utes, yet the album clocks out to a
solid 44 minutes and 24 seconds.
Though not entirely unlisten-
able, it grows stale and eventually
makes its way into background
noise.
The biggest problem with the
album doesn't necessarily fall
onto a specific track but more of
a broader sense of the direction
MGMT has decided to follow.
Their music now seems to be driv-
en on their own logic that people
expect them to be weird and psy-
chedelic when what people really
want is a genuinely good album
that gives off the feeling of actu-
al input. MGMT didn't become
MGMT because they made ter-
rible, avant-garde bullshit, they
became MGMT because they gave
indie kids something a little differ-
ent but still fell within the blurred

Who doesn't want her very
own Mr. Darcy to sweep her off
her feet, caress her in his arms
and tell her

lines of pop-rock.
No one expects another album
full of "Electric Feel" or "Kids"
or even "Congratulations." They
expect an album that exudes
thought and substance, which
can leave plenty of room for the
bands own personal experimenta-
tion, buta compromise needs to be
made between the two sides.
Fortunately, MGMT has songs
like "Mystery Disease" and "Your
Life Is A Lie" which provide a little
hope to listeners that the band still
has some fire in them. The heavy
percussion on "Mystery Disease"
leads into a contrasting sing-
along style melody that stands out
against the surrounding fizzling
tracks. "Your Life Is A Lie" has the
same repetition found throughout
the album, but whether it's the
quirky lyrics or the very present
cowbell, itholds its own as an iden-
tifiable track.
It could be possible that MGMT
is an album ahead of its time that
the mere masses just don't under-
stand, but as it stands now, it's a
feeble attempt at an innovative
record.

princess. A
woman is a whole person capable
of loving herself unconditionally
rather than seeking validation
from someone else.
In "Austenland," Jane (Keri
Russell, "Dark Skies") is a devot-
ed member of the contrary - the
more populace portion of women
who value men more than they
value themselves. She worships
Jane Austen's body of work. She
has memorized the first three
chapters of "Pride and Preju-
dice," kisses a cardboard cut-out
of Colin Firth daily and totes
around abagwith "I heart Darcy"
in big, bold letters. But these
aspects of her obsession pale in
comparison to the accumulation
of fairy-tale garb that consumes
every inch of her bedroom.

Shunning the wise advice of
her best friend, who is firmly
grounded in reality, Jane drops a
tonofdoughandimmersesherself
in the ultimate Jane Austen expe-
rience, an amusement park-like
setting straight out of her beloved
author's fiction. But, of course,'
the experience disillusions Jane
who grows overwhelmed by a
confusing dichotomy of veracity
and fantasy.
The film fulfills an audience's
insatiable need for guilty plea-
sures with a silly storyline so
far-fetched that the movie finds
a way to get the green light from
a producer (Stephenie Meyer
of "Twilight" fame); the film
scratches the itch for this niche
and, though it doesn't make
sense, it'll make some dollars. It's
an entirely implausible scenario
that drags on and on with pre-
dictable beats and trite tropes.
The humor falls flat, whether it's
cheesy dialogue by Jerusha Hess,
a somewhat seasoned writer but
first-time director, or awkward
timing by the actors.
The performances satisfy,
but only just. Jennifer Coolidge
("American Reunion") plays
Jane's Austenland buddy, her
stereotypical role as the flighty
floozy-slash-sidekick, and it's
overkill. To its credit, the film

presents a few memorable
moments, like when Jane plays a
version of rapper Nelly's "Hot in
Herre" on the piano to the strong
dismay of Mrs. Wattlesbrook
(Jane Seymour, "Freeloaders"),
the curt, uppity owner of the
wacky world.
Stephenie
Meyer's version
of true love.
"Austenland" is a starkly
hyperbolic display of the unavoid-
able and, at times, unbreakable
attachment to fantasy. It's a film
that supports my belief that,
speaking from experience, some
women desire the perfect part-
ner so desperately that they lose
themselves in the process. Some-
times, you gotta live to learn.
(Spoiler alert) But the saccha-
rine and fantastical nature of the
film dilutes the message when
Jane ends up with her own ver-
sion of "Mr. Darcy" anyway. I
spoil because, as pathetic as it
sounds, a self-help book would be
more helpful than this movie -
maybe cheaper, too.

FOOTBALL
Get used to seeing utt Wile still struggling

By EVERETT COOK
Daily Sports Editor
The man tied for third on the
No. 15 Michigan football team
in receptions didn't have the
preseason expectations that
redshirt freshman wide receiv-
er Jehu Chesson did. He also
doesn't have the experience that
fifth-year senior Joe Reynolds
or senior Jeremy Jackson do.
He's tied for third in catches
with fifth-year senior Drew
Dileo, an offensive mainstay,
and with sophomore Dennis
Norfleet, one of the fastest and
most exciting position players
on the roster.
The player, freshman tight
end Jake Butt, is perhaps the
biggest offensive surprise of the
season. He was so skinny going
into spring camp that fifth-year
senior offensive tackle Michael
Schofield thought he looked
more like a wide receiver than a
tight end.
Now, more than seven
months after spring camp, Butt
is growing both into his body
and a bigger role in the Wolver-
ine offense.
"I thought Jake Butt was
probably our nicest surprise
after spring football," said
offensive coordinator Al Borges
last week. "He came in kind of
light, so we assumed it would
probably take a year and we
would redshirt him. But he
came back bigger and stronger.
Jake's always had good football
awareness, even from the first
day he got here. So he's made a
contribution much faster than
we had anticipated after spring
football."
In high school, Butt caught
almost 100 passes and was a
considered a top-five tight end
recruit by every major scouting
service in the country. He was

expected to contribute, just not
right away.
After - choosing to enroll
early, Butt arrived on campus
in January, which likely made
all the difference for the type
of work he put in. Starting five
months before the rest of the
class allowed Butt to acceler-
ate his physical development, so
without that extra time in Ann
Arbor, there's a good chance he
would still be on the sidelines.
"When he first came in, he
was a little smaller and a little
skinnier and everything," Scho-
field said. "He kind of looked
like a receiver. Now, he's defi-
nitely built up. I've seen a lot
more improvement in his run-
blocking skills. That strength
he's added has definitely helped
him to become a better run-
blocking tight end."
Against Notre Dame, Butt
saw significant minutes and was

targeted in the red zone several
times. He finished with two
catches, but that game signified
his emergence in the lineup.
Last week against Akron,
with No. 2 tight end A.J. Wil-
liams sidelined because of an
ankle injury suffered against
the Fighting Irish, Butt stepped
into the starting role and caught
two passes for 27yards. His only
big mistake was a holding call
in the second quarter, but even
then, Hoke thought his young
tight end was doing solid work.
"Jake did a pretty good job,"
Hoke said Monday. "They called
him for a hold that I would
really like somebody to find.
The (referee) must have seen
it differently. I thought he just
dominated the block to be hon-
est with you. Maybe you aren't
allowed to do that, I don't know.
But overall, for a young kid, I
think he did a pretty good job."

The fact that Butt is ahead
of guys like Chesson, Reynolds
and Jackson in catches might
say more about their early per-
formances than it does about
his. After fifth-year senior Jer-
emy Gallon, Michigan needs
more production out of their
wide receiver corps, regardless
of how the tight ends are play-
ing.
But if the progression holds,
Michigan fans will see a lot of
Butt much sooner than expect-
ed, and beyond.
"When Jake got here in Janu-
ary, we recruited him obviously
so we thought he had ability,
but I think how he's progressed
through the program has been
really positive, from the weights
to the academics to all that
stuff," Hoke said last week. "I
know we're very comfortable
with Jake. I think he's got a
bright future."

In 15th season, Rosen looks for next step

0

By LEV FACHER
Daily Sports Writer
Mark Rosen has been the head
coach of the Michigan volleyball
team since 1999. He's amassed
an all-time record of 295-178 and
earned 12 NCAA Tournament
bids, five of which have led to
Sweet 16 appearances.
Despite his experience, Rosen
is in unfamiliar territory in 2013.
Fresh off the program's first-ever
Final Four berth in 2012, the
10th-ranked Wolverines are deal-
ing with sky-high expectations,
both from within the program
and the rankings.
"Our goal is a national champi-
onship," Rosen said. "No doubt."
Rosen has already coached one
team to a national championship,
but not at this level - he won it all
in his first year as the head coach
of Division II Northern Michigan
in 1994. Getting that far in the Big
Ten, though, is an entirely differ-
ent animal.
The American Volleyball
Coaches Association ranked
Michigan (7-1) seventh in its pre-
season poll, the highest preseason
ranking the program has ever
received in its 41-year history.
But Rosen is taking nothing for
granted.
"We never discuss rankings,"
Rosen said. "It doesn't come up.
Those rankings don't win us
any games, and aside from that,
there's always a debate about
their accuracy."
But not all the hype can be so
easily dismissed. The Wolverines
were also recognized on the field
at Michigan Stadium on Sept. 7
during the football team's night-
time tilt with Notre Dame, where
an NCAA-record crowd of 115,109
greeted them with a standing
ovation,
"They reserve that opportu-
nity for really special things,"
Rosen said, recalling that he had
to explain to the freshmen and
sophomores on the team that
being honored on the field at the
Big House is not, in fact, normal.
Being recognized on the field
during a football game has been.
a longtime goal of Rosen's, and
finally getting the chance after 14
years at Michigan was validation

difficult to beas present as he and
Leisa would like.
"We try a lot during the off-
season to make sure one of us is
here all the time," Rosen said.
"That allows us to be a little more
normal during the other eight
months of the year."
Normal or not, they are at the
helm of a team that, for the first
time in their careers at Michigan,
is a preseason national champion-
ship contender. The goal in 2013 is
to take the proverbial "next step"
- the leap from being a program
that finds itself in the Final Four
unexpectedly to being a program
., ? that expects to be there every
year.
Despite their consistent suc-
cess throughout Rosen's tenure,
the Wolverines have never won a
FILE PHOTO/Daily Big Ten championship. The big-
gest reason for the drought is the

Nittany Lions are ranked first
nationally, and have started off
their season 6-1 with their lone
loss coming to No. 6 Texas.
"I think it's great, because we
see (Penn State)," Rosen said. "If
we're going to put ourselves in a
position to win a national cham-
pionship, we're probably going to
have to go through them at some
point."
For the first time in his career,
Rosen seems ideally positioned
to win that conference title and
make noise on the national stage
for the second year in a row.
Michigan lost only one senior fol-
lowing last year's Final Four run
- right side hitter Claire McEl-
heny - giving it one of the most
experienced rosters in the confer-
ence.
The Wolverines have age, tal-
ent and the experience of making
it to the Final Four on their side,
meaning that 2013 could be the
year Michigan takes that "next
step" Rosentalks about so often.

Michigan coach Mark Rosen celebrated his 500th win as a head coach on Aug. 31 against Xavier.

for all the work that has gone into
building up the program to its
current level.
"A lot of people came here
before this team and didn't get
that opportunity, because they
didn't earn it," Rosen said.
If there's anybody who has
earned it, though, it's Rosen.
He earned his 500th win as a
head coach on Aug. 31 in a three-
set decision at Xavier. Rosen
acknowledged the achievement's
significance, but deflected credit
to his team and the rest of his
coachingstaff.
"It sounds cliche," Rosen said,
"but I don't really watch those
milestones very much."
Rosen's path to Michigan
would have been difficult to
predict early in his life. Grow-
ing up in Anchorage, Alaska,
Rosen took a circuitous route to
becoming Michigan's sixth head
coach. After earning his degree
in physical education from Cal
State Northridge, Rosen made
coaching appearances at North-
ern Michigan, Boise State and Cal
State Bakersfield before landing
in Ann Arbor.
As unlikely as Rosen's journey
from Anchorage to Ann Arbor
may have been, he hasn't had to
do it alone - Rosen's wife, Leisa,
is Michigan's associate head
coach. A fellow Alaskan and for-
mer volleyball standout at Ohio

State, Leisa had known Mark
casually since her high-school
years. The couple began dating
after a chance encounter in Los
Angeles at the Final Four, which
Mark attended as a coach and
Leisa asa player for Ohio State.
Her alma mater, though, is an
afterthought at this point - she's
also been coaching at Michigan
for 15 years, and her comparative-
ly brief career as a Buckeye is far
in the past.
"Leisa's a great coach," Rosen
said. "Had she not been married
to me and had we not been doing
this together, she would have very
much gone on somewhere else to
be a head coach."
The uncommon husband-wife
coaching combination doesn't
strike Rosen as odd - he grew
up in a similar family structure.
Rosen's father made a living as
an accountant, and Rosen's moth-
er ran the business' computer
department.
Rosen thoroughly believes that
the family atmosphere is a posi-
tive for the program in terms of
recruiting and the way it operates
in general.
"We care greatly about our
players, not just as athletes but as
student-athletes and as people,"
Rosen said. "That's a lot easier
since we have that husband-wife,
family atmosphere here."
Even though the two have been

coaching together since 1998, it
hasn't always been so easy. When
Mark was the head coach at Cal
State Bakersfield in the early
1990s, Leisa was denied a posi-
tion as an assistant coach because
the school's athletic department
wasn't comfortable with the duo
coaching together, according to
Mark.
Boise State thought otherwise,
though, and hired Mark and Leisa
as the head coach and recruiting
coordinator, respectively, in 1998.
After posting an 18-9 record, the
couple jumped at a pair of offers
from Michigan, where they've
been ever since.
The Rosens have loved their
time in Ann Arbor, but having
their family so thoroughly inter-
twined with the Michigan vol-
leyball program presents its fair
share of challenges in addition
to the perks that come with it -
especially for the Rosens' two
sons, Brady and Cameron.
"There are benefits, of course,
like when they get to be around
the football atmosphere (against
Notre Dame), the volleyball atmo-
sphere," Rosen said.
But the 15-year veteran also
acknowledged that the regular
season can be hectic from a par-
enting perspective. The constant
weekend road trips, weeknight
games and the grind of year-
round recruiting make it more
