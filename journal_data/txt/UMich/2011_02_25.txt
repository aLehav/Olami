CAMPUS COMMUNITY
Ann Arbor to
host largest
student-run
LGBTQ event

'U' Spectrum
Center also
celebrates 40 years
of advocacy
By BRIENNE PRUSAK
Daily StaffReporter
The University's LGBTQ
community and allies will take
center stage this weekend as
students from across the region
descend upon Ann Arbor to join
in the largest student-orches-
trated LGBTQ conference in the
country.
The Midwest Bisexual Les-
bian Gay Transgender Ally Col-
lege Conference, first held in
1993 at Iowa State University, is
convening at the University of
Michigan for the first time this
year. The conference is being
held in Ann Arbor to match the
timing of the 40th anniversary
of the University's Spectrum
Center.
The Spectrum Center, which
serves as a source of support for
LGBTQ University students and
allies, is the primary host of the
event, but other organizations
like Planned Parenthood and
the American Civil Liberties

Union are also contributing.
Jim Toy - who founded the
University's Spectrum Center,
known at the time as the Human
Sexuality Office, in 1971 - said
he's looking forward to the con-
ference's guest speakers. Mara
Keisling, executive director of
the National Center for Trans-
gender Equality, and Mandy
Carter, founding board member
of the National Black Justice
Coalition, will be delivering
addresses at the event.
"(The conference) recognizes
and highlights Spectrum's his-
tory and achievements since it
was founded 40 years ago as
the first office of its kind in the
United States and in the world,"
Toy said.
The conference will also offer
workshops and film screenings
centered on the event's theme,
"Justice or Just us? Achieving
liberty for all."
Toy, the first person in the
state to openly state his sexual
identity, said events like the
conference are "absolutely"
important in light of the LGBTQ
bullyingthathas occurred with-
in the past year.
"Those of us who diverge
or appear to diverge from the
norms imposed on us by soci-

M-HEAL develops

By SABIRA KHAN

Students in Michigan
Health Engineered for All
Lives (M-HEAL) will be head-
ing south to warmer weather
like many University students
embarking on spring break

trips next week. But rather than
relaxing on the beach, they will
be visiting natives in rural Gua-
temala.
The group of eight under-
graduate and graduate engi-
neering students will be goingto
the Central American country
to do research on their newest
invention, a remote stethoscope,
which has a recorder connected
to it. Once fully developed, the
stethoscope will allow clini-
cians to record patients' heart
sounds and send them via cel-

lular networks to hospitals in
larger cities, like Guatemala
City, where trained physicians
can analyze the sounds.
Rackham student Nathaniel
Skinner, the project manager,
said the remote stethoscope will
help doctors diagnose patients.
"The rural clinics will record
the heart sounds of the babies
that are in that area and then
send them over the network to
city centers," he said. "There,
trained physicians can listen to

By JEREMY ARMAND
Daily StaffiReporter
With students fleeing the
frigid weather of Ann Arbor for
postcard-like destinations next

week, local businesses hope to
limit their profit losses while
students are away on spring
break.
Local businesses in the South
University Avenue and South
State Street areas are expect-
ing to see a decrease in business,
but have prepared for the week-
long slow down. However, some
establishments like area bars,
are hoping students still in town
will cash in next week.
Hope Mleczko, manager of

Seva Restaurant on East Liberty
Street, said the coincidence of
the Ann Arbor school district
and the University being on
break at the same time is unfor-
tunate for business.
"With the Ann Arbor Pub-

University of Michigan spring
break at the same week, it's very
slow, " Mleczko said.

New housing policy expected

der students will also have the
option of sharing a suite with
consenting students of their
identified gender, Harper said.
While these students will still
have their own rooms, they'll be
able to share the suite - which
would have a communal bath-
room - with suitemates of their
preferred gender.
At the meeting, Harper said
the University decided to move
forward with the policy because
it wants to provide the best envi-
ronment possible for all students,
including those who identify
themselves as transgender.
"The intent is that if you are
(transgender), we want to make
sure you have a safe, healthy ...
experience," Harper said.
In an interview after the meet-
ing, Armstrong said though the
University's decision wasn't what
he hoped for, it was a step in the
right direction.
"It's definitely progress, but
obviously it's not necessarily
what the Open Housing Initia-
tive initially envisioned," he said.
"But I'm certainly happy ... with
the change that has happened."
Echoing Armstrong, MSA Rep.
Allison Horky, a co-leader of the
Spectrum Center Student Advi-
sory Board and co-founder of the
Open Housing Initiative, said she
was pleased with the opportuni-
ties the policy will open up for

transgender students.
"The change tonight is very
important because it directly
affects transgender students,"
Horky said.
Armstrong said he plans to
continue advocating for the Open
Housing Initiative throughout
the remainder of his term.
"We're still going to be work-
ing on this issue," Armstrong
said.
In response to Armstrong's
sentiments, Harper and Jackie
Simpson, director of the Spec-
trum Center, said the University
has a long way to go before it
can comfortably enact a gender-
neutral housing policy. Simpson
brought up worries about female
safety as one possible hindrance
to enacting a gender-neutral
housing policy.
"For some, it's the fear of safe-
ty for womenthat raises concerns
about people of the opposite gen-
der living in the same space,"
Simpson said.
Harper added that more dis-
cussion must take place between
different groups at the University
before it can move forward with a
gender-neutral housing plan.
"I think it is going to take a lot
of education," Harper said. "I just
think we have alot of work to do."
Simpson said in an interview
after the meeting that the office
is working to draft the new policy
within the next two weeks. She
said she's excited to play a part in

allowing transgender students to
live in suites with people of their
identified gender.
"We want to make sure we
have a campus climate that is
conducive to making those stu-
dents feel comfortable," Simpson
said.
According to Simpson, the
policy will likely take effect for
incoming freshmen starting in
the fall.
Interviewed after the meeting,
Housing spokesman Peter Logan
said he thinks that from a Uni-
versity housing standpoint, the
policywill be easy to implement.
"They'll work out something
that's very doable," Logan said.
"I think this is a step in the right
direction."
In a press release issued after
the meeting, members of the Uni-
versity's chapter of the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union wrote
that the organization is standing
behind the Open Housing Ini-
tiative and its commitment to a
more extensive gender-neutral
housing policy.
"We are enthusiastic about
the progressive policy change
announced at the meeting
tonight, but we believe there
must be a continued push for
an Open Housing option that
is available to all University of
Michigan students," LSA junior
Ellen Steele, a University ACLU
member, wrote in the press
release.

Agents arrested
more than 100
people in 150
locations
WASHINGTON (AP) - Fed-
eral, state and local authori-
ties conducted a massive sweep
yesterday of suspected Mexi-
can drug cartel members in the
United States in a widespread
domestic response to the kill-
ing of a U.S. agent in Mexico last
week.
"We are taking astand and we
are sending a message back to
the cartels that we will not tol-
erate the murder of a U.S. agent,
or any U.S. official," said Carl
Pike, assistant special agent in

charge of the Drug Enforcement
Administration's special opera-
tions division.
Pike said the nationwide
roundup, which began Wednes-
day and was expected to con-
tinue into today, is targeting
suspected criminals with ties
to any Mexican drug cartel to
try to disrupt drug trafficking
operations in the United States.
By yesterday morning, agents
in areas including Atlanta, St.
Louis, Denver, Detroit, San
Antonio, San Diego, Chicago
and New Jersey had seized more
than $4.5 million in cash and
nearly 20 guns, arrested more
than 100 people and confiscated
about 23 pounds of metham-
phetamine, 107 kilos of cocaine,
5 pounds of heroin and 300
pounds of marijuana at more

than 150 different locations.
Immigration and Customs
Enforcement agent Jaime Zapa-
ta was killed, and fellow ICE
agent Victor Avila was wound-
ed in Mexico on Feb. 15 when
the Chevy Suburban they were
in was run off the road by at
least two vehicles loaded with
armed men. Authorities have
said the agents, who were driv-
ing in a fortified sport utility
vehicle with diplomatic license
plates, identified themselves as
U.S. diplomats in the moments
before the shooting.
Mexican authorities have
arrested one person in connec-
tion with the brazen attack,
which is believed to be the work
of members of Mexico's Zetas
gang. Former Mexican special
forces soldiers are among its
members.
"We are basically going out
to disrupt narcotics distribu-
tion here in the United States
no matter what cartel their
allegiance is to," Pike said. "It
would be futile to send a mes-
sage back 1o one cartel when
they all are just as guilty."
Pike said that while the
sweeps are a direct response
to Zapata's killing, the major-
ity of suspects were already
targets of other investiga-
tions.

Pure Michigan ad
campaign in line
for $10M boost
The state's popular Pure Michi-
gan tourism campaign will be
able to do more spring, summer
and fall advertising because of an
additional$10 millionapproved by
state lawmakers yesterday.
The bill, passed 35-1 by the Sen-
ate, is headed to Republican Gov.
Rick Snyder for his signature. The
House already had approved the
bill.
The legislation allows an addi-
tional $10 million to be trans-
ferred into the campaign from the
state's 21st Century Jobs Fund.
That's double the previously allot-
ted amount and raises overall Pure
Michigan funding for this budget
year to $25 million, as requested
by Snyder.
The tourism funding bill could
become one of the first signed by
Snyder, who has been governor for
less than two months.

Cost of the WTC

Planners of the new World

An official at the Port Authority

the agency's commissioners yes-
terday that the price of the train
and subway station has climbed to
$3.44 billion.
Construction director Steven
Plate says soaring steel arches
designed for the building by archi-
tect Santiago Calatrava will cost

Plate says designers had to add

Japan hosts first

The world's first robot mara-

Japan, with five two-legged par-

track.
The race kicked off yesterday
with the 1-foot (30-centimeter)
-tall, battery-charged robots
competing around a 110-yard
(100-meter) racetrack. They will
have to cover 26 miles (42 kilo-
meters).
Japanese robot maker and
event organizer Vstone Co. says
the "Robo Mara Full" race in
Osaka will demonstrate the
machines' durability and maneu-
verability.
Vstone robots took an early
lead, while two entrants by Osaka
University of Engineering teams
got off to a shaky start. The race is
expected to last through Sunday.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.
Ivies reinstate
early admissions
Harvard and Princeton say
they are restoring their under-
graduate early admissions pro-
grams.
Harvard dropped its early
admissions program four years
ago, saying it wasn't easy for dis-
advantaged students to access
and contributed to high school
student anxiety. Princeton fol-
lowed suit, hoping other schools
would join in, but the idea didn't
catch on.
The two schools announced
yesterday that they will restore
their respective programs. Both
also say students accepted early
will have until the regular spring
deadline to decide whether to
attend.
Harvard also says it is boost-
ing financial aid to coincide with
a nearly 4 percent increase in
tuition. The total cost of attend-
ing Harvard next year is estimat-
ed at nearly $53,000.
It also pledged to improve
recruiting of students from more
modest academic backgrounds.

Carmen Fernando, general
manager of Ashley's Pub on
South State Street, said the
week of spring break is typi-
cally slower, but she said the
pub will hold special events
throughout the week to attract
customers.
"Hopefully, focusing on
doing beer events and all that
will definitely offset any impact
that we're having from the kids
that are not in town," Fernando
said.
Stacy Amwake, manager of
The Brown Jug on South Uni-

dents' week off has a negative
impact on business, she expects
more customers on Monday

them, and while they might not
be able to fully diagnose them,
they can probably screen them
and say if there's a problem or
not."
Skinner said that each year,
about 1,500 Guatemalan babies
are born with cardiac defects.
He said these deficiencies could
lead to major health complica-
tions later in life. According to
Skinner, about two-thirds of
Guatemala's population lives
in rural areas without access to
the developed health care sys-
tems of urban hospitals.
Because it is such a "labori-
ous trip" to go to the city, Skin-
ner said rural residents don't
get screened on a regular basis
and are unable to detect car-
diac defects. He said he hopes
the remote stethoscope will
encourage rural residents to
go to city hospitals for medical
help more often.
"Now, they might be able to
get some feedback from people
that listened to their electronic
vitals and say, 'Oh, I hear some-

ety-at-large are, as we know
too well, at risk of harassment,
discrimination and assault to
property and person," he said.
The event will bring national
attention to Ann Arbor's role
as a national leader in LGBTQ
rights, Toy said. The first-ever
Gay Pride Week was held in
Ann Arbor in 1972, and the city
amended its non-discrimina-
tion policy to protect gender
identity and expression in 1999.
"(The) conference's presence
and influence will necessarily
point up Ann Arbor's leader-
ship in supporting all of us in
our human worth and dignity,"
Toy said.
The Spectrum Center's 40th
anniversary feels "fabulous and
at the same time unreal," Toy
said.
"When we founded the office
through the generous risk-

taking of the (University), we

as much school work and will
be able to go out.
"It will hurt us a little, but
it kind of evens it out. It gives
us more businesses on our slow
days," Amwake said.,
With the economic recession
still affecting the region, busi-
nesses might not see as large a
decrease in customer traffic as
they would if people had more
money to spend on vacations or
other spring break escapades.
"I noticed actually starting
last year, that the impact (of
spring break) wasn't as severe
as it's been in the near past,"
Fernando said. "I can't exactly
say why that was. Maybe not as
many people were leaving for
spring break due to the econo-
my.
She added, "I'm not going to
under-staff too much this year
just considering that last year
was a pretty good spring break
for us."

You should probably come in,'"
Skinner said. "And they might
take the risks involved in tak-
ing that trip into the city."
After the excursion this
break, M-HEAL will create a
more developed version of the
device. All versions of the tool
will undergo such "rapid and
extensive" changes, Skinner
said, that the initial device will
probably not be recognizable in
a year.
"It's just kind of proof-of-
concept. We're not going to be
using it on people down there,"
he said. "It's sort of a working
prop so that we can see how the
people will interact with it."
According to Skinner,
M-HEAL aims to leverage the
engineering skills students
learn at the University to tackle
health problems. The Appropri-
ate Technology Collaborative,
an Ann Arbor-based non-prof-
it organization, approached
M-HEAL in November with
the request for a device to meet
this specific need in Guatemala.
ATC is associated with the
Aldo Castaneda Foundation in
Guatemala - named for Har-
couldn't have predicted this
event, which brings together
so many TBLGQ students and
allies from schools across the
Midwest," he said.
The Spectrum Center not
only serves as a resource to
LGBTQ students, Toy said, but
it is also vital to the University
community as a whole.
"The human sexual-
ity threads of our total identity
tapestry are bound together
with all the other elements of
our identity," Toy said. "There-
fore Spectrum responds to and
highlights the interconnection
of oppressions. As we know - it
can't be said too often - no one
is free until we all are free."
University alum Howard
Bragman, founder of public
relations firm Fifteen Minutes
in Los Angeles, expressed his
support for the Spectrum Cen-
ter's work on campus. Bragman
worked with the University
when Andrew Shirvell, a for-

mer Michigan assistant attor-
ney general, targeted Michigan

said he expects a significant
drop in activity next week.
"We figure it's about 30 to
35 percent less for the week,"
Jones said.
The specialty gift store
Middle Earth on South Uni-
versity Avenue also anticipates
a lull in business, according
to the store's owner Cynthia
Shevel, who expects business
to decrease about one-third in
sales.
"Much of our business is stu-
dents and other people associ-
ated with the University, so if
they are not here, it definitely
impacts." Shevel said.
According to a Noodles &
Company spokesman Michael
Endres, spring break isn't a
major concern for the chain
restaurant located on South
State Street.
"It's a little down, but it's
something ... that basically we
plan for each year," he said.
"It's nothing that causes a
major impact."

Castaneda, a native of Guate-
mala. With its donations, the
foundation provides pro bono

Guatemala City.
Skinner said the main goal of
the trip - which the students
will embark on tomorrow - is
for them to get a feel for the
situation and familiarize them-
selves with the people they're
trying to serve.
"It's very important for every-
one in the group to have a much
deeper, more visceral experience
of the conditions, what's avail-
able and the needs of the people
that we're going to be trying to
address with this technology
(in order) to give them the tech-
nology in a way that's perfectly
accessible to them," he said.
Skinner said his goal for the
trip is to solve all the "engineer-
ing and cultural determinants
that have to be flushed out" so
the most appropriate device can
be produced.
"I think there is a lot there,
even before we start churning
out engineering work, just get-
ting in touch with the people,"
he said.
Student Assembly President
Chris Armstrong last year
because of his sexual orienta-
tion. Armstrong is the only
assembly president who has
been open about being gay.
Armstrong is attending the
conference and is also set to
introduce Jim Toy before his
speech on Saturday. He added
that he thinks the conference
will demonstrate the Univer-
sity's commitment to LGBTQ
issues.
"It's a really exciting thing
for Michigan," Armstrong said
in an interview last night. "It's
an opportunity for Michigan to
host the LGTB community."
Bragman said it was "amaz-
ing" how the University sup-
ported Armstrong and fought
against hate speech.
"(The University) never
asked, 'What's the politically
correct thing to do?' They only
asked, 'What's the morally
right thing to do?"' Bragman

said. "It reminded me what a
great place the University is."

GEO
From Page 1
Literatures, held his 17-month-
old daughter as he participated in
the rally.
Marching from the Diag to the
Cube, GEO members passed out
copies of a letter addressed to
University President Mary Sue
Coleman for rally attendees to
sign, which they later presented
to her. The letter asked for Cole-
man's support of GEO's efforts to
improve parental accommoda-
tions at the University, including
the union's push for increased
child care and parental leave
options.
The letter states that union
members want the University to
better accommodate employees'
rights when it comes to child care
and continue to support initia-
tives like making breastfeeding
easier in appropriate places on
campus.
Pous - who, like Kroll, has
been involved in the parent cau-
cus of GEO - said the Univer-
sity's requirement that a spouse
must work or study more than
20 hours a week to have access
to child care benefits should be
eliminated.
GEO President Rob Gillezeau,
a graduate student instructor
in the Department of Econom-
ics and a graduate staff research
assistant for the Center for
Afroamerican and African Stud-
ies, said one of the most impor-
tant efforts of GEO is obtaining
access to child care subsidies for
international students. He said
a current work restriction keeps
international students from get-
ting child care subsidies because
they have a limit on work hours
as foreigners that prevents them
from qualifying for some benefits
under University rules..
In an interview at the rally,
Gillezeau said he and other
GEO members feel the contract
bargaining process is moving
too slowly. He added that the
current contract is supposed to
expire March 1, but GEO plans to
ask to extend the deadline until
March 18 at a meeting to be held
today.
"We will be coming back
strong after the break to ensure
that we don't let this momentum
fall," Gillezeau said to the crowd.
GEO has been bargaining with
the administration since Decem-
ber. Gillezeau said he anticipates
the union will be granted an
extension, which usually hap-
pens during years when the
contract is being negotiated.
The contract is negotiated every
three years.
Patrick O'Mahen, former com-
munications chair of GEO and a
former Michigan Daily colum-
nist, told the crowd that several
University administrators prom-
ised on Wednesday that they
would be getting back to GEO
today with package proposals.
O'Mahen urged those at the rally

to go to the meeting today to bar-
gain with the administration.
"Please come out and support
your local bargaining team, sup-
port yourselves, support your
union," O'Mahen said.
Sam Montgomery, chair of
GEO's organizing committee,
said in addition to GEO's effort
for increased parental rights, the
union is lobbying for disability
accommodations, increased sala-
ries and more rights for GSRAs.
In recent weeks, members of
GEO have been contacting the
University administration -
including through the delivery of
an oversized letter to Coleman's
office - hoping to gain approval
to allow GSRAs collective bar-
gaining rights in the union.
Lauren Reed and Alix Gould-
Werth, GSRAs in the School of
Social Work, said they attended
the rally to express support for
the campaign to have GSRAs
included in GEO's contract.
"The University has been slow
to return proposals, and I think
it's been frustrating for us that
they're unwilling to recognize
that we, as (GSRAs), are work-
ers and that we have the right to
organize," Gould-Werth said.
Jeff Frumkin, the University's
associate vice provost and senior
director of the Department of
Academic Human Resources,
said in an interview last week
that the University" is not inter-
ested in voluntarily recognizing
GSRAs as having the ability to
organize."
Reed said she thinks GSRAs
and GSIs should be included
under the same collective bar-
gaining contract because many
graduate students either hold
both positions at the same time
or switch between the two from
semester to semester.
Gould-Werth said she also
attended the rally to express her
solidarity with GSIs on issues
like child care. She and Reed said
they think many GSRAs in the
School of Social Work are sup-
portive of being included under
GEO's contract.
Members of the Lecturers'
Employee Organization attended
the rally as well. Ian Robinson,
LEO member and a lecturer in
the Department of Sociology and
the Residential College, said he
N~Fiaikll LEO members would
agree that GSRAs should have
the right to unionize.
"There shouldn't be any
impediments put in the way of
people signing up and joining a
union if that's what they want to
do," Robinson said.
At a meeting on Tuesday,
GSRAs from the Department
of Aerospace Engineering and
other attendees expressed
hesitation about joining GEO
to Gillezeau and other union
officers. Some of the meeting's
attendees said they felt there
wasn't a need for GSRAs to
unionize and wouldn't join in
the efforts until they saw statis-
tics expressing that need.

Wisconsin s woes
Governor's actions have set a scary precedent
Workers have the right to bargain with their employees
over wages, working conditions and benefits, but newly
elected Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is trying to take
that right away from state employees. Budget cuts are needed in Wis-
consin, which, like many states, is facing a major budget shortfall. But
instead of negotiating with public-sector unions, Walker is trying to
eliminate them altogether. His actions have paralyzed Wisconsin as
protesters have gathered at the Capitol, and he has set a dangerous
precedent for the rest of the country. Governors facing deficits should
work with unions to produce sensible budgets, not use shortfalls to
attack public employees.

A New Age' thought process

n my last column, (Encourage
crazy ideas, (2/11/2011) I dis-
cussed the importance of non-
linear thought,
thinking outside
of the box and I
highlighted an'
upcoming forum.
called TEDx-
UofM that will
showcase some
of the Univer-
sity's leaders in TULIAN
this regard. I TOLES
now realize that
I may have left
some readers with one deeply burn-
ing question: How do I develop my
own "crazy" idea?
An often essential component of
crazinessiscreativity.Whathappens
when you unite creativity, multiple
disciplines, enthusiasm and spiritu-
ality? If you guessed "magic," you're
completely correct. Congratulations.
Welcome to Creative Process.
Officially titled UARTS 250, the
class unites a diverse group of stu-
dents from various stages in their
academic careers and offers the
perfect medium for collaboration.
Students spend two weeks each in a
unit on art, dance, architecture and
engineering. This provides them
the chance to forge relations with
faculty who they would likely never
interact with outside the confines of
a focused course load.
One of the University's most
intriguing courses, Creative Process
seeks to overturn the commonly
held belief that creativity is a natu-

ral essence, an x-factor-like attribute
passed down genetically that bene-
fits only the winners of the "ovarian
lottery," as investor Warren Buffet
calls it. The course aims to demystify
our notion of creativity.
We're provided random and
quirky prompts such as "butter," or
"things fall apart", atypical materi-
alsandunexpectedtasks.Thecourse
forces participants to step outside of
their coveted comfort zone.
It's a pioneering course with a
noble goal: To serve as a beacon to
"inform or inspire similar courses at
other Michigan institutions," as the
course description states. But as stu-
dents, we also gain inspiration from
one another. I've been in awe at each
and every project display day we've
had thus far, and was especially
amazed by a classmate who inter-
preted her "weightlessness" prompt
as a command to set her final project
ablaze - which she did.
Whereas most courses seek to
instill convergent thought, Creative
Process embraces the divergent.
There is no "one right answer" and
no "one way to get there," other
than commitment, of course. This
stipulation is where the latter half of
the namesake, the process - which
invites ingenuity and persistence -
comes into play.
And with an optional meditation
component, the class encourages
life skills far beyond the confines of
classroom walls. A weekly colloqui-
um on spirituality is one of the most
attractive and unexpected aspects
of the course. It embraces a "New

Age" thought process, which has
gained credence in the mainstream
with the likes of gurus Deepak Cho-
pra and, to a lesser extent, hip-hop
mogul Russell Simmons. Inspired
by the likes of philosopher and
mystic Meister Eckhart, students
explore the four paths to creativity
in a hands-off manner by embracing
mindfulness.
UARTS 250 helps
students develop
'crazy' ideas.
A refreshing air of calmness and
tranquility fills the interspaces of
the seminar during this portion of
class - two emotions that we typi-
cally don't associate with any type
of lecture during our college years.
I, for one, never dreamed of a class
with an emphasized spirituality
component.
In the end, it may not be as much
about unearthing one's creative
capacities as it is about cultivating
and reigniting them. As Pablo Picas-
so said, "Every child is an artist. The
problem is to remain an artist once
they grow up." If you're a student
looking for anenthralling and inspir-
ing course next winter, remember to
seek out Creative Process.

Wisconsin faces a $3.6 billion budget defi-
cit over the next three years. Among Walker's
proposals to cover that gap is a bill that would
require state employees to vote each year on
whether their union should exist and limit
public-sector employees' right to yearly col-
lective bargaining meetings with state offi-
cials. Since Walker announced his plan last
week, protesters have crowded the state Capi-
tol in Madison, jamming galleries and sleeping
among statues on the rotunda floor. Fourteen
Democratic senators have taken refuge in Illi-
nois, leaving the state Senate without enough
members to vote on the plan.
Union leaders in Wisconsin say they're will-
ing to accept all the cuts the governor has pro-
posed. The fact that Walker continues to push
for an end to collective bargaining proves that
he isn't interested in balancing the budget -
he wants to dismantle the unions. Through
misleading language of fiscal responsibil-
ity, Republicans in Wisconiifare working to
break state-employee unions.
Wisconsin Republicans - including Walker
- share agreat deal of the blame for the state's
current fiscal woes. The new state Legislature
irrationally passed $117 million in tax cuts as
soon as members took office, knowing that
the cuts would only increase the state's multi
billion-dollar deficit. Wisconsin Democrats

deserve credit for their decision to leave the
state. By preventing the state Senate from con-
vening, they may force Walker to tone down
his misguided proposal.
There are times when it may be necessary
for the government to limit union rights, but
there's a big difference between limiting
rights and takingthem away all together. State
employees hadn't yet come to the bargain-
ing table when the governor announced his
plan to take away their right to bargain. They
went on strike only after he refused to meet
with union leaders. Walker's effort to defeat
public-sector unions is the latest assault in an
unprecedented Republican offensive against
working-class Americans.
Wisconsin's careless governor has set a
terrible precedent that other states under
Republican leadership are beginning to fol-
low. Republicans in Indiana and Ohio have
proposed similar bills to limit both public- and
private-sector labor unions. Michigan Repub-
lican Gov. Rick Snyder has, admirably, stated
his intention to work with state employees'
unions through the budget process. This is the
model that other states should follow as they
face fiscal crises of their own. Wisconsin's
governor - and other Republicans - should
foster a spirit of cooperation, rather than all-
or-nothing policies.

MATTHEW SHUTLER I
Harry Potter and 'U'

As a self-proclaimed member of the "Harry
Potter" Generation, I've spent the past 15
years fighting alongside Harry,' Hermione
and Ron as they grew from little children
to powerful adults. In a way, their journey
mirrored my own - only without a wand
or those annoying life-or-death encounters.
The "Harry Potter" series helped usher me -
and millions of others - into adulthood, giv-
ing us an intricate and extraordinary world
to lose ourselves in. Filled with supremely
real characters, there was never a lack of role
models or situations that I could relate to.
Whether it was dating, dealing with loss or
just being happy, Harry Potter has been there
and shown me that these feelings are univer-
sal. No one is alone.
HarryPotter has certainlyhad an impacton
my generation, and I don't think it's an over-
statement to call it one of the biggest cultural
phenomenons of all time. I still remember
practicing the "swish and flick" and "dueling"
with friends at recess with sticks we found
(yeah, we were just that cool). It's stemmed
numerous incarnations - literary and non -
to create a little bit of magic in our world. You
can even visit Hogsmeade and Hogwarts now
if you happen to be in Orlando. But the truer
test of its power and impact comes on a much
more personal scale. Rowling's masterpiece
has helped guide me to where I am now, and I
know I'm not the only one who feels that way.
As Harry made friends, enemies, fell in love,
out of love and back into love, I was, and still
am, doing the same. The true mark of Harry
Potter is that in a world filled with magic,
brooms, dragons and someone who'goes by the
name Lord Voldemort, it's the characters and
life events that truly color the pages.
As I walk through campus - especially the

Law Quad - I feel as though one could easily
transport themselves to this world. The Uni-
versity is our own personal Hogwarts. A place
to live, learn and love. This school is definitely
full of magic - anyone who's eaten in the caf-
eteria during one of the Thanksgiving dinners
knows that's pretty much as close as one can
get to a feast in the Great Hall. It's here, just
walking with friends, that I feel most con-
nected, or maybe it's just that college has been
the best comparison to the wizarding world
of Harry Potter (bonus points for those who
know what that was a reference to). While I've
never had a class as fun as flying or a teacher
quite like Hagrid, the realness of the books
and characters makes getting into the Uni-
versity feel like I received my own personal
Hogwart's letter. I treasure my time here,
and I think I appreciate its magic all the more
because of reading these books.
As Harry's journey reaches its conclusion
with his final cinematic romp taking place this
summer, I feel as though I'm finally graduat-
ing as well. I'll be starting my final year at the
University and preparing for life outside its
walls and comfort. While my career choices
sadly don't include being an Auror or dragon
trainer, the possibilities are still endless. I
plan to tackle the unknown of the next couple
years with the same determination and excite-
ment that I've used waiting for and reading
these books. The series has helped countless
people find a love for books and reading, but
what I think is even more important, is that
it's helped people find their voices. So go take a
break fromstudying, lose yourselfinthe magi-
cal world and catch up with some old friends.
You'll be doing yourself a favor.

C ongratulations! If you're
reading this, it means you've
survived the most challeng-
ing week of the
semester thus
far. You've stud-
ied for three
exams, knocked
out a 10-page
paper and tried
not to slap your
classmates while SARAH
preparing for yet .
another group SMITH
project. You had
to sacrifice pre-
cious hours of sleep and sell your
soul to Starbucks to find the energy
to keep going, but it's all over now -
and if you're lucky, you're packing
your bags to travel somewhere far,
far away from Ann Arbor for Spring
Break.
While it may seem obvious,
our collective pursuit of academic
achievement is what we all have in
common as students. But as a mem-
ber of a sorority, I'm often bothered
by the lack of attention given to
the scholastic achievements of our
Greek community. One of the most
prominent stereotypes about fra-
ternities and sororities is that their
members are stupid - caring more
about an upcoming party or going
shopping than their homework or
that exam next week. (See: John
"Bluto" Blutarsky and Elle Woods.)
I won't dispute that among the
University's 5,000 Greeks, there
are probably some who fit that ste-
reotype. But as a community, we
certainly don't. At the University of
Michigan, the All-Greek GPA is con-
sistently higher than the All-Univer-
sity GPA, suggesting that fraternity
and sorority members aren't only
matching their non-Greek counter-
parts in the classroom, but actually
outperforming them.
Certainly, every student at a uni-
versity as prestigious as ours is intel-
ligent,-and there are lots of men and

women here who are doing well in
their studies without being affiliated
with a Greek organization. But it's
clear that Greeks enjoy an academic
edge. So the question becomes, why?
In my experience as a leader both in
my sorority and in the greater Greek
community, I've identified several
factors that, in my opinion, make
fraternity and sorority members
more likely to succeed.
The first thing to consider is the
sheer foundation of our organiza-
tions. The earliest fraternities and
sororities began as scholastic groups
and literary societies - places for
men and women to meet outside the
classroom and discuss what they
were learning. Over the years, Greek
organizations have incorporated
social and philanthropic elements,
but the original emphasis on scholar-
ship hasn't been forgotten. Today's
Greek organizations have high
expectations for their members, and
most chapters have minimum GPA
requirements that are enforced for
current brothers and sisters and for
the men and women who are inter-
ested in joining their organization.
While GPA requirements may
seem trivial, I think they have a
major impact. In my two years of
recruiting women for my sorority,
I've seen that scholarship can make
a big difference - there have been
potential new members who we've
removed from our consideration
because they didn't meet our aca-
demic standards. On the contrary, if
I learn that a woman going through
recruitment had graduated at the
top of her class in high school, Iwill
want her to join my organization
because I know that she has high
personal standards and prioritizes
academic success. Additionally, a
GPA requirement forces current
fraternity and sorority members to
continue to prioritize their studies
throughout college because fall-
ing below it could result in expul-
sion from the organization. Thus,

if members prioritize their Greek
involvement, they must also priori-
tize their grades to remain a brother
or sister of their organization.
Fraternities and sororities also
develop scholarship programs to
help their members succeed academ-
ically. These programs vary widely
from chapter to chapter, but they
often include providing places to
study and recognizinghigh achieve-
ment. My chapter, for example, has
two rooms in the house reserved
for quiet study and holds a scholar-
ship dinner every semester to honor
the women who have succeeded the
most in their studies.
Greek members
are definitely
making the grade.
Other chapters do things like
reserving rooms at University librar-
ies for their members or raffling off
gift cards to sisters who have aced
a test recently. Furthermore, the
Panhellenic Association encour-
ages chapters to publicly announce
their members' accomplishments
at weekly Panhel meetings. Most
importantly, fraternities and sorori-
ties can assist members who are
struggling by finding a brother or
sister to tutor them or developing
individualized study plans for each
member who needs help.
Regardless of the reason, frater-
nity and sorority members at the
University are definitely making the
grade, perhaps even more so than
non-Greek students. So let's leave
Hollywood stereotypes behind and
recognize that Greeks aren't stupid
- they're actually pretty darn smart.

Blue faces Rutgers seeking first win

No-hitters routine for
Wolverine ace Taylor

By DANIEL WASSERMAN

While practicing in Port
St. Lucie, Fla., the Michigan
baseball team got a glimpse of
NASA's space

covery, taking Michigan

swept to open
the season,
Michigan now turns its atten-
tion to Rutgers (1-2) for a three-
game set.
"It's definitely important to
get in the win column," senior
pitcher Kolby Wood said Thurs-
day. "We need to get that first
one on the board to get some
confidence going because we
saw a lot of good things (last
weekend), but we just couldn't
put it all together at the right
times.
"So if we can get one (win) on
the board, just build some con-
fidence, it'll go from there. We
have a young team. So I think
it's important to get some con-
fidence going early."
While scoring runs wasn't an
issue for the Wolverines - they
averaged six runs a game - poor
pitching and defense proved to
be a killer. Michigan made two
errors a game on its way to giv-
ing up nearly 12 runs per game
in losses to No. 21 Louisville, St.

John's and No. 22 UConn last
weekend in Florida.
For northern teams like
Michigan, who are forced to
practice indoors and lack the
opportunity to take real fielding
practice prior to opening week-
end, rust can play a large part in
early season defensive woes.
"I think it had something to
do with not being out there on
dirt (before last weekend),"
junior first baseman Gerrett
Stephens said. "It's a lot differ-
ent than playing on turf, where
we're accustomed to the same
feel every ground ball. We've
got a team that's very, very
capable of being one of the best
defensive teams that we've had.
I think we're going to work the
kinks out defensively to where
that's not going to be a problem
for us."
The Wolverines may have
gotten a blessing in disguise
from the snowstorm that hit the
Midwest Sunday night, delay-
ing the team's connecting flight
home. While stranded in Nash-
ville, Tenn., the team traveled
to nearby Lipscomb University
and practiced on the Bison's
baseball field.
"It's always big being able
to get outside," Stephens said.
"Every chance we get to see live
pitching and to see where your
balls going and take ground
balls in a game situation - it was
really crucial. It was a better
time than being in Oosterbaan
(Field House). I know that."

named to Michigan
Sports Hall of Fame
By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Writer
For most, throwing a no-
hitter in a collegiate softball
game would be a career-defin-
ing moment. Two is the mark
of a rare talent. Three is largely
unheard of.
But when Wolverine senior
Jordan Taylor took to the mound'
last Friday against Long Island
and surrendered no hits, it
seemed like just a typical day of
work.
After all, Taylor's perfor-
mance in Michigan's 6-0 vic-
tory over the Blackbirds marked
her seventh-career no-hitter,
extending a Wolverine record
she broke last year.
During Taylor's dominant
performance - she evert took a
perfect game into the last frame
before issuing a leadoff walk -
she kept her composure, display-
ing the mental toughness that
has led to her fast start this sea-
son. Her 4-0 record and 27-con-
secutive scoreless innings have
been a key contributor to Michi-
gan's early-season success.
"We're very, very pleased with
(Taylor)," Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins said. "She's shown a lot

of great leadership."
Hutchins, currently in her
26th season at the helm of the
Michigan softball team, was
named this week to the Michi-
gan Sports Hall of Fame. She was
inducted with a class of other
former Wolverine football coach
Lloyd Carr and former NFL
great Jerome Bettis. Her tenure
as a Michigan coach is currently
surpassed only by hockey coach
Red Berenson.
This weekend, No. 9 Michi-
gan (10-0) will return to the
Sunshine State for another pre-
season tournament. Five more
games - and a chance to add
on to their undefeated record -
awaits the Wolverines in Orlan-
do at the University of Central
Florida Invitational.
To do so, Taylor, as well as the
other half of the team's starting
pitching tandem, sophomore
Stephanie Speierman, will need
to continue to send frustrated
batters back to the dugout.
The team has received a great
deal of run support in the sea-
son's early stages, including
scoring outputs of 19, 16, 11 and
10. And the team's pitching staff
could not be more pleased.
"It definitely takes off a lot of
pressure," Taylor said.
With no nerves - or hits
allowed - the wins may keep
coming in droves for the Wol-
verines. And with its ace Taylor
safely intow, atrip to the College
World Series in Oklahoma City is
not out of the question.

gan coach Red
Berenson said Tuesday. "We have
a chance to finish high, and we
want to do it."
This weekend, the Wolver-
ines square off against Northern
Michigan in Marquette, Mich. in
their final regular-season series
- Michigan's final opportunity
to catch conference frontrunner
Notre Dame. The eighth-ranked
Fighting Irish, who face Western
Michigan in a home-and-home
series this weekend, are a point
ahead of the Wolverines in the
standings.
For Michigan (18-7-1 CCHA,
21-9-4 overall), a team that has
already secured both a share
of second place in the confer-
ence and a first-round bye in the
CCHA Tournament, the chase
atop the league is incentive
enough to power through one
last pair of games.
"We want to finish first,"
sophomore forward Chris Brown
said. "It's motivation and it's
going to give us a little more edge
this weekend - knowing that we
do control our own destiny."
But the series also serves as
a last-ditch chance for the Wol-
verines to fine-tune their power-
playunit.
After failing to convert on
22-consecutive man-advantage
situations, Michigan broke
through with a pair of goals on
four attempts in the back half of
a series sweep against Ohio State
last weekend.
And though the power play
showed signs of life against the
Buckeyes, it has a golden oppor-

ern Michigan. The Wildcats are
the most-penalized team in the
conference and have the low-
est penalty-kill percentage at 79
percent - an ideal combination
to jump start the Wolverines'
power play.
"We need to not think about it
as much, again, just react on the
power play," Brown said. "We're
trying to do too many set plays
when we need to just play hock-
ey. I think if we do that, on an
Olympic-sized rink, get a couple
opportunities, I think we'll score
a couple more goals."
And goals may be easier to
come by against Northern Michi-
gan (12-11-3, 14-15-3), who boasts
the second-most goals allowed
(102) in the conference - only
one fewer than Bowling Green.
Last week, Berenson moved
senior forward Scooter Vaughan
- a former defenseman - back
to the point on the top power-
play unit, in large part due to
his offensive success this season
along with his defensive roots
and speed that could eliminate
counterattacks.
Replacing senior defense-
man Chad Langlais on the point,
Vaughan represents the only
right-handed shooter on the blue
line during the power play.
"Scooter's got a good shot and
he's got some puck luck going
right now," Berenson said. "He's
got a lot of momentum and I

think he's a good fit up there."
While Michigan counted
on a late power-play goal from
senior forward Carl Hagelin in
the waning seconds of overtime
last Saturday in the Wolverine's
5-4 victory against Ohio State,
senior forward Louie Caporusso
emphasized the importance of
emphatic - not dramatic - per-
formances against the Wildcats.
"That was a big win for us on
Saturday, but we don't want to
win like that every night," Capo-
russo said. "That's just not good
hockey. We didn't play good
hockey throughout the whole
game. It's not as much about win-
ning as how you win."
Added Berenson: "We have
something to prove, obviously.
We know we need to play better
than we played last weekend. So
it's week after week after week -
we're going to have to keep get-
ting better if we're going to be
any kind of playoff contender."
The Wildcats' arena doesn't
feature an out-of-town score-
board, so Berenson won't need to
worry about his players becom-
ing distracted with the Fighting
Irish's results.
"Notre Dame's a great team,
and there's nothing that we're
going to do that is going to
change whatthey're goingto do,"
Caporusso said. "We've got to
concentrate on ourselves - Fri-
day night, Northern Michigan."

Blue in desperate need of conference win at Minnesota

S&

By CHANTEL JENNINGS
Daily Sports Editor
With the Michigan men's bas-
ketball team's last-second loss to
No. 12 Wisconsin on Wednesday
night, the stakes have been raised
for the Wol-
verines as they Michigan at

has to deal with
Minnesota's
infamous raised floor.
The players on the bench will
be at eye level with their team-
mates' shins and Michigan coach
John Beilein will have to look up
to his squad as he calls out direc-
tions.
The Wolverines are looking to
rebound from devastation, but

as they've showed before - after
close losses to then-No. 3 Kan-
sas and then No. 2 Ohio State
- they've usually been able to
bounce back.
"I don't think we can play vic-
tim, I don't think that will help us,
at all," junior Stu Douglass said
after the Wolverines' loss to Wis-
consin. "We just got to look for-
ward to Minnesota and Michigan
State. That's all we can do right
now."
But Michigan is looking for-
ward to a Minnesota squad that
beat it 69-64 earlier this season.
The Gophers (6-9, 17-10) used
their immense length to suffocate
the Wolverines with a 2-3 zone
defense. Against that defensive
set, Michigan shot just 12-for-35
fromthe field.
Minnesota's frontcourt -
juniors Colton Iverson and Ralph
Sampson III - standing at 6-foot-
10 and 6-foot-11, respectively - is
complemented by two smaller
forwards, redshirt junior Trevor
Mbakwe and sophomore Rodney
Williams. Mbawke and Williams,
who both stand above 6-foot-7,
feature 7-foot-1 wingspans, mak-
ing them especially dangerous on

the wing in the 2-3 zone.
The Gophers also used thatsize
to dominate the Wolverines on the
glass. Minnesota outrebounded
Michigan, 38-13, and kept redshirt
freshman Jordan Morgan off the
glass. It was his only game this
seasonwherethe 6-foot-8 forward
failed to grab a single rebound.
"It's a whole team effort," Mor-
gan said of the team's rebounding
struggles after that performance.
"It's not just down low. That's a
large part of it, but we need every-
one trying their best to just clean
up on rebounds."
Sophomore point guard Darius
Morris was also less effective
than normal that game for the
Wolverines. He recorded just 11
points and four assists after get-
ting into early foul trouble. But
since then, Morris has averaged
14 points and six assists, as he
gains more experience in confer-
ence play.
"He's playing against Big Ten
talent," Beilein said of Morris
after the Wolverines' loss to the
Gophers. "It'svery difficult.You're
not goingto be the same. He's still
going to find ways to function and
he's goingto keep working on it."

Despite Hicks's halfcourt heroics, Blue honors Hicks
'M' falk in dohle-OT to Gonher, in senior ceremony

Senior guard Veronica Hicks
didn't want her last game at
Crisler Arena to end.
So with just second remaining
in the game,
Hicks hit a MINNESOTA 82
half-court MICHIGAN 78
buzzer shot
to send the game against Minne-
sota into overtime.
"There's always hope when
someone throws up a desperation
shot like that," sophomore guard
Jenny Ryan said. "I guess in my
eyes you're just not thinking,
you're holding your breath, hop-
ing for the best and expecting the
worst. As soon as it goes through
the net you just breathe and you
run."
Fueled by Hicks's long-range
basket, the Wolverines (9-6 Big
Ten, 16-11 overall) played two
periods of overtime against the
Golden Gophers. But a struggling
offense that had plagued Michi-
gan all night proved deadly in the
second overtime, giving Minne-
sota a chance to pull ahead and
win, 82-78.
Hicks claimed to have felt con-
fident taking the game-deciding
shot at the end of regulation off
a play that Michigan coach Kevin
Borseth said he's had in his pock-
et for four years.
"The funny part is that I was
(shooting half-court shots) dur-
ing the shoot around," Hicks
said. "So when they went up by
three with only four seconds left
and coach (Borseth) showed us
the play, I was like, 'I practiced
it today.' So, you know, God must
have been preparing me, and it
went in."
But that confidence may have
come as a surprise to the fans at
the game Thursday night, as the
Wolverines showed anything but
strength around the basket.

Michigan shot just 27 percent
in the first half, stemming from
a mere 16 percent from behind
the 3-point arc and a leading
scorer who tallied just four
points in the first stanza.
But the Wolverines were
also unable to answer Minne-
sota (4-11, 12-16) in the second
half- until the last second. The
Golden Gophers came out of the
locker room with a 25-19 advan-
tage and, despite a handful of
good looks from Michigan, were:
able to maintain a two or three-
possession lead for the majority
of regulation.
The Golden Gophers gave
the Wolverines trouble on the
interior, forcing them to shoot

range. Michigan also had 14.

Following the Michigan
women's basketball team's
heartbreaking 82-78 double-
overtime loss to Minnesota
on Thursday, players and fans
alike were in tears.
It was an odd sight following
a college basketball game. But
the tears weren't shed because
of the game's outcome - it was
Senior Night, and the Wol-
verines' lone senior, Veronica
Hicks, was being honored on
the Crisler Arena bigscreen.
"I think it was pretty well
said on that video board,"
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth
said after the game. "She's been
here for four years, and she has
sunk her heart and her soul into
everything we do here."
Friends, family, teammates,
classmates, Crisler employees
and hundreds of people that
Hicks had never met stayed
after the game for the presen-
tation - the tears alone are a
testament to what Hicks has
meant to this program. Even
though it was nearly 10 p.m. on
a school night, parents allowed
their children stay to watch the
presentation and listen to Hicks
speak after the game.
The fact that Hicks was even
willing to speak after the game
- 50 minutes filled with emo-
tional highs and lows, in which
she had arguably the worst first
half of her career (zero points,
two fouls), hit a half court shot
to send the game into overtime,
only to have her team lose by
four points in double overtime
- was incredible by itself.
Most players probably would
have respectfully declined
the opportunity, or just said a
couple of thank you's and went
home.
But not Hicks.
She'd rather take the oppor-

tunity to put smiles on the faces
of everyone in the arena.
After watching the 10-min-
ute presentation that showed
highlights of her career along
with interviews of her team-
mates and coaches, were shown,
Hicks grabbed the microphone.
She had a speech prepared,
and she wasn't going to let one
heartbreaking loss affect her so
much that she couldn't take the
time to say a few words.
The speech lasted nearly 10
minutes, but the words that she
spoke will stick with the people
in Crisler for much longer.
She personally thanked
everyone she knew in the
arena, including Crisler Arena
employees, assistant coaches,
classmates and even members
of the media.
She talked about her time at
Michigan and how it has made
her into the person that she is
today. She gave all the credit to
anyone and everyone - except
for herself.
And she did it all with a gen-
uine smile on her face.
It's easy to get caught up in
sports sometimes, especially
after a crushing double over-
time loss. It's easy to sit around
and feel bad for yourself and
think about how things could
have been different - how
making one play could have
been the difference.
But for 'Roni' Hicks, she'd
rather take time to thank other
people after her final home
game - take time to realize the
big picture. The loss hurt, but
she'll get over it. Her experi-
ence at Michigan is one that
she'll cherish for the rest of her
life, and she never loses sight of
that.
"It's rough," Hicks said of the
loss. "But I'm very happy, very
appreciativeto have played here
... I'm thankful, and I appreciate
everybody."

Harbaugh comments on coaching jump to NFL

Jim was sitting just to John's

how Jim Harbaugh didn't need
his older brother's advice about
Jim's unprecedented accom-
plishments at Stanford the past
four years, with the Cardinal's
meteoric rise to the top of college
football.
"He built a family and his fam-

Harbaugh, the head coach of the
Baltimore Ravens.
Jim decided to start a new
football family, as he left Stan-
ford for the San Francisco 49ers
last month. At the time, Har-
baugh was the hottest coach-
ing candidate in the country,
drawing interest from all over
- including speculation that he'd
return to his alma mater, Michi-
gan.
Michigan wasn't where Har-
baugh wanted to go, though.

decision, too. And Jim will have
the chance to compete against
his brother John - the 49ers
and Ravens are scheduled to play
each other next season.
According to Baalke, there's

a reason San Francisco had to
fight off competitors like Denver,
Miami, Stanford and Michigan,
who were chasing Harbaugh
hoping he'd coach their teams.
"I'm just a big believer in pedi-
gree," Baalke said. "Jim's been
a football guy his entire life. He
grew up, obviously his father was
a well-respected coach. He grew
up playing it, grew up wanting
to be a coach, started coaching
while he was still playing.
"He's a football man. He loves
the game, has a great respect for

the game. And I think that's the
passion that I saw in him dating
back to when I ran into him at the
All-Star games. I just had a really
good feel that he'd be successful."
Michigan eventually hired
Brady Hoke, formerly of San
Diego State, with hopes of turn-
ing around a program that fin-
ished 15-22 in three seasons
under Rodriguez.
As for what Harbaugh thinks
of Hoke:
"Great coach, class guy," he
said.

An obituary from
a die-hard 'Friday
Night Lights' fan
By JENNIFER XU
Senior ArtsEditor
In a typical game, the Dillon
Panthers enter the fourth quarter
21 points down and then score 14
back within the last 10 minutes]
six more in the last ten seconds.
And then theygo for the two-point
conversion, every time. I guess it's
to the credit of my substantial
non-knowledge of football that I
thought this sort of thing was the
norm in high school athletics. Not
that it really matters, since the
secret that all the fans of "Friday
Night Lights" have been hoarding
is that the show has never really
been about football.
When the star quarterback of a
Texas highschool football team is
paralyzed in the first game of the
season, shockwaves are sent deep
into the core of Dillon, a charac-
ter as much as it is a town bub-
bling with racism, homophobia,
alcoholism and regional narrow-
mindedness - traits that even the
show's most heroic characters
display to a certain extent. What's
most laudable about the show is
its candid portrayal of the South
as a place with real-life prob-
lems, which make it feeltruer and
more of a home than any rose-
tinted rendition of southern belle
decadence (a la "Gone With the
Wind").
Now that "Friday Night Lights"
has taken its final bow out of TV
circulation after five flawlessly
rendered seasons, I really don't
know what I'm going to do with
myself. For all its deficiencies,
there are so many things that I'm
going to miss about Dillon - the
dizzy crane swing up to the tall,
tall stadium lights right before a

ing up as if they were getting

ready for a Middle Earth war, the
pre-game prayer-slash-pep talk,
the raging party that follows avic-
tory, the silent bus ride home that
follows a loss. A football game is
never just a football game - it's
a space in time where battles are
fought and men are molded.
In reviewing movies, I think I
do an OK job at encapsulating a
film experience into a 600-word
block of text. But I can't even
begin to touch on the way I feel
about "Friday Night Lights" and
how much it's affected the way
I view high school, football and
most importantly, television.
I've realized the reason I
don't really like to watch TV is
because the writers consistently
create narrative arcs that don't
make any sense. One minute the
characters are all happy and put-
together, and then out of the blue
there's a murder or a pregnancy
or a dastardly flashback to the
past. In television, authenticity
is often sacrificed for a continu-
ous half-hour storyline that you
don't get as much in film's tautly

stretched screenplays. But what I
love about "Friday Night Lights"
is that it rarely ever lets the epi-
sodic nature of its medium take
precedence over its characters
and setting. Everything it does
just makes sense.
"Play it that way, like you're
never gonna lace up again. Play it
that way, and then let it go,"one of
the former players says to anoth-
er, and we believe him - because
truly, nothingevermeantas much
to us as it did when we were in
high school. I was reading a medi-
cal school memoir a few days ago,
and the author was saying that
so much effort was exerted on a
few innocuous decisions in their
cadaver dissections - which stu-
dent was going to be their cadaver
partner, who was going to make
which incisions, what they were
going to wear to the dissection.
Because many of their deci-
sions are made for them by fac-
ulty members and senior doctors,
every little choice they made was
just that much larger in scope.
High school is much of the same

way. Prom, football games, grad-
uation - nothing was ever "just
a game" or "just a dance." When
your world is smaller, everything
holds just that bit more of signifi-
cance, and I think "Friday Night
Lights" understands that in its
bones better than anything.
I don't care if most TV shows

a grapefruit - a
very twisted and captivating way
to present the 24-year-old's latest
album.
Bundick - better known by the
stage name Toro Y Moi - brought
himself to chillwave fame with
his first album, Causers of This in
2010, but Underneath the Pine goes
down a different avenue of wave.
It is a more intellectualized, ambi-
ent collection of live instrumenta-

experimental exploration in the
deep blue sea of sound, each layer
