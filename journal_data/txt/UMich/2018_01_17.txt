Lydia Polgreen, editor-in-chief of 

news blog HuffPost, discussed her 
relationship with journalism and 
the way in which her past affects 
her vision of present-day America 
in her lecture entitled “Who gets to 

define American Values,” given as 
part of the University of Michigan’s 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King 
Jr. Symposium.

The Wallace House program, 

as well as the Knight-Wallace 
Fellowship and Livingston Awards, 
sponsored 
Tuesday’s 
event. 

Polgreen won the Livingston Award 
for Journalistic Achievement in 

2009 for her international reporting 
in a piece called “The Spoils,” a story 
about natural resource exploitation 
in Africa.

Before coming to HuffPost, 

Polgreen was the editorial director 
for NYT Global at The New York 
Times, as well as the West Africa 
and Johannesburg Bureau Chief. 
Polgreen officially became editor-

in-chief of the Huffington Post, 
which serves 200 million viewers 
per month, in December 2016, 
succeeding 
founder 
Arianna 

Huffington. 

On the heels of Martin Luther 

King Jr. Day, Polgreen drew on the 
reminders of King’s message in 

On Tuesday, Steven Salaita, 

an American author, scholar 
and activist, spoke about his 
latest book, “Inter/Nationalism: 
Decolonizing 
Native 
America 

and Palestine,” and the lingering 
effects of colonization on modern 
countries. The event was hosted 
by the University of Michigan’s 
Center for Middle Eastern and 
North African Studies at the 
International Institute in Weiser 
Hall.

Salaita has been at the center of 

campus controversy in years past, 
after anti-Israeli tweets landed 
him in trouble as a professor 
at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign. The UIUC 
board of regents rescinded an 
offer of tenure to Salaita in 2014 
— his critics accused him of 
inappropriate online expressions, 
but others said he was being 
punished for political views. 
Salaita appeared on campus at 
the University shortly after his 
firing in 2014 to muted contention 
from pro-Israeli groups. This year, 
however, after the #UMDivest 
resolution passed in its fifth 
attempt before Central Student 
Government in November, some 
Jewish students decried Salaita’s 
speech. 

Before the event, about a dozen 

Jewish community on campus 
stood outside Weiser Hall and 
passed out flyers featuring a tweet 
from Salaita that the students saw 
as anti-Semitic. The flyer, which 
was signed “Concerned Jewish 
Students,” accused Salaita of 
purporting discrimination against 
Jewish students on campus. 

“Shame 
on 
the 
Michigan 

Center for Middle East and North 
African Studies for inviting this 
so-called 
academic 
to 
speak 

on our purportedly inclusive 
campus,” the letter read.

Salaita began his speech by 

explaining the parallels his book 
draws between the colonization 

of Native Americans in the United 
States and the Israel-Palestine 
conflict. He said he believes a 
true peace agreement cannot 
be 
reached 
while 
illegal 

settlementscontinue to be built on 
Palestinian land.

“We ought to look at Israel-

At 
Tuesday’s 
City 
Council 

meeting, council members decided 
to amend plans for ground-level 
solar 
energy 
installations 
in 

residential zones in order to comply 
with public concern regarding the 
safety of children and the aesthetic 
integrity of Ann Arbor.

In a public comment, Ann 

Arbor resident Irma Majer voiced 
her concern for the safety of local 
children and explained the dangers 
of ground-level solar structures in 
easily accessible areas.

“By allowing unsecured, low to 

the ground solar accessories, we 
create opportunities for serious 
injuries to the public, particularly 
curious and exploring children,” 
Majer said.

Majer, alongside several other 

residents, went on to explain that 
while they support solar energy, 
they are also highly concerned for 
the safety of the community. Majer 
explained solar panels can reach 
extreme temperatures, causing

While the program makes 
tuition more affordable for

According 
to 
a

by 
Research 
in 
Middle 

Education from 2011, groups 
of students who were tutored 
in Language Arts and Math 
outperformed students who 
did not receive such help 
from tutoring programs. With

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: BSU DAAP CLASH DURING MLK RALLY

January 16, 2001 

By Jacquelyn Nixon 
Daily Staff Reporter 

As students took to the streets 

yesterday to advocate affirmative 
action, there were clear divisions 
among the 200 participants in how 
the message supporting affirmative 
action shoul be presented.

Shortly after students marched 

from the corner of South University 
and South Forest avenues to the 
Diag, where the rally began, the 
crowd parted as members of the 
Black Student Union and the Black 
Greek The University’s 14th annual 
Martin Luther

Association entered. They held 

green King Jr. Symposium signs 
stating 
affirmative 
action 
was 

their issue and not an issue for the 

Coalition to Defend Affirmative 
Action and Integration and Fight for 
Equality By Any Means Necessary.

BSU members joined BAMN and 

the other organizations on the steps 
of the Harlan Hatcher

Graduate 
Library. 
BAMN 

member 
Ebonie 
Byndon 
said 

although BAMN has encountered 
problems with BSU members in 
the past, BSU members have never 
before charged into a BAMN event. 

BSU members said they feel 

BAMN is an outside force which 
does not truly reflect the concerns 
of the minority students of the 
University.

Monique 
Luse, 
an 
LSA 

sophomore on the BSU executive 
board, 
said 
BSUrespects 
that 

BAMN fights for affirmative action, 
but they don’t agree withtheir 
tactics. 

“The organization is not run by 

University students. BSU, on the 
other hand, is led by the students.
BAMN does not have that same 
element,” Luse said. 

Throughout the rally, sparks 

began to fly between BAMN and 
BSU members in the crowd. 

“We would work hand in hand 

with this organization, but they 
won’t let us,” said BSU

historian 
D’Yal 
Mcallister. 

Donna Stern, a paralegal for 
BAMN,said the BSU and BAMN 
have different ideas about the type 
of action to take for progress in the 
area of affirmative action. 

“They don’t want mass militant 

action. It takes people getting on the 
streets to win.”

LEO decries stalled bargaining process 
with University HR on new contract

Lecturers’ union of 1,700 members calls for increase in wages, benefits and an expedited response 

As 
bargaining 
between 

the University of Michigan’s 
Lecturers’ 
Employee 

Organization 
and 
University 

administration 
continues 

regarding wages, performance 
evaluations and other factors, 
LEO members are expressing 
frustration with what they say is 
a lack of administrative response 
to their proposals.

LEO 
is 
a 
member-run 

organization representing non-
tenure faculty among the three 
University campuses. Founded 
in 2003, the organization has 
approximately 1,700 members 
and aims to improve working 
conditions and protect the rights 
of lecturers at the University. 

Lecturers are hired by term 

or school year, as opposed to 
professors who have established 
contracts with the University. 
Full-time lecturers teach three 
or more courses a semester 
at the Ann Arbor campus, 
but lecturers at the Flint and 
Dearborn 
campuses 
must 

teach at least four courses to be 

considered full-time. According 
to LEO president Ian Robinson, 
a sociology Lecturer IV, the 
starting salary for a full-time 
Lecturer I is $34,500 in Ann 
Arbor, $28,300 in Dearborn 
and $27,300 in Flint. The Ann 
Arbor campus’ average cost of 
attendance for a lower division 
in-state student is $29,526 per 
year.

Robinson 
also 
said 
that 

turnover rate, or the percentage 
of employees that leave during a 
year, for Lecturer I positions is 
at 40 percent.

Bargaining has been ongoing 

since the beginning of last 
semester. Lecturers can also 
lose their health benefits over 
the summer when they are not 
teaching, and pay for Cobra, 
a government program that 
gives those who lost healthcare 
benefits the right to their group 
plan for a limited period of time 
to alleviate this.

Currently, LEO’s bargaining 

platform 
includes 
improved 

job security for Lecturer I 
and 
III 
positions, 
making 

performance evaluations more 
meaningful, streamlined and 
fair, extended affordable health 
care, significant increases to the 

minimum salaries, a dedicated 
fund to support lecturers who 
are advancing DEI objectives 
and all schools having a vote 
on enfranchising lecturers who 
are at least half-time and have 
taught at the University for at 
least one year.

Philip Christman, co-chair of 

the Ann Arbor campus branch 
of LEO and English Lecturer 
II, said he hopes to see lecturer 
salaries increase due to the 
revenue lecturers generate for 
the University. 

“A lot of people are taking 

our classes,” Christman said. 
“Non-tenured faculty tends to 
teach the classes that are more 
lower-level and introductory, so 
we meet more students ... we’re 
generating a lot of revenue for 
the University.”

Christman 
also 
explained 

standards 
for 
performance 

evaluation vary among campus 
location and academic unit.

“I know there is a real 

disproportion between academic 
units and on the different 
campuses in terms of how much 
effort some people have to go 
through to do their annual 
or major review versus some 
others,” Christman said. “For 

some people, the demand 
of review is reasonable, 
and other people are just 
outright being bullied by 
their supervisors.”

According to LEO’s blog, 

one example of this varied 
treatment within academic 
departments is a lecturer 
not receiving a raise because 
his school felt the salary 
he was paid was already 
high enough. The Daily 
was not able to confirm this 
anecdote, however.

“A 
lecturer 
in 
a 

professional school at the 
University of Michigan in 
Ann Arbor was due for his 
second major review,” the 
post reads. “The school 
wanted to skip his 7% raise, 
basically because they felt 
he was already being paid 
a lot.”

Robinson also feels there 

are issues with how the 
University responds to non-
financial 
proposals 
LEO 

makes.

“There (were) proposals 

where 
they 
didn’t 

necessarily involve money but 
they did involve a change in the 
way we were doing things and 
their response was just to simply 
hand it back and ex out all of the 
changes we proposed without 
any real explanation,” Robinson 
said. “We feel like ... come up 
with a counter-proposal that 
has some language that at least 
moves in the direction of the 
concern we’ve expressed or tell 
us why you cannot do anything 
in response to that concern.”

University spokespeople told 

The Daily they feel progress 
being made in the bargaining 
process.

University 
spokeswoman 

Kim Broekhuizen wrote in a 
statement the University will 
continue to negotiate until a 
resolution is determined.

“The University is in the midst 

of 
bargaining,” 
Broekhuizen 

wrote. “We are making progress, 
and will continue to actively 
negotiate until we reach a 
resolution. Bargaining has been 
ongoing every week since late 
October. And the contract does 
not expire until late April. This 
is all part of the normal process 
for bargaining.”

Robinson said the University 

told union members it would 
respond 
to 
LEO 
regarding 

benefits proposals this Friday. 

LSA 
graduate 
Neala 

Berkowski worked with LEO 
through Radfun, a group that 
aims to improve student culture 
through creating art, zines and 
radical spaces for students of 
marginalized groups. In an 
email interview, she wrote she 
also hopes to see lecturers’ 
contracts improve. 

“Ultimately, myself and I’m 

sure many other students are 
hoping lecturers will get a fair 
contract,” 
Berkowski 
wrote. 

“If this doesn’t happen, the 
administration will obviously 
be hurting a lot of lecturers by 
making their lives considerably 
harder. But I don’t think the 
administration 
has 
really 

thought 
enough 
about 
how 

their 
choice 
will 
impact 

students as well. Low starting 
salaries and low job security for 
lecturers means higher lecturer 
turnover, so students will have 
a harder time forming long-
term relationships with their 
instructors.”

RACHEL CUNNINGHAM

Daily Staff Reporter

If you were looking out your 

window Tuesday night, you 
may have seen a bright flash 
light up the night sky at about 
8 p.m. While many assumed 
it was just lightning, the 

National Weather Service and 
United States Geographical 
Survey confirmed the light 
was, in fact, a meteor.

Many 
videos 
posted 
on 

YouTube and Twitter from 
car dashboard cams and home 
security systems show the sky 
fade to light blue, followed by a 
short burst of orange light and 

then back to the normal black 
sky. Some videos show a trail 
forming from the meteor.

Reports to the American 

Meteor Society of the bright 
light 
were 
received 
from 

locations in six states and 
Canada. According to NWS, 
the 
meteor 
caused 
a 
2.0 

magnitude earthquake near 

New Haven, Michigan.

Former 
U.S. 
Rep. 
John 

Dingell 
tweeted 
Tuesday 

night his bewilderment at the 
possibility of a meteor flying 
over Michigan.

“What’s 
this 
meteor 

nonsense?” Dingell wrote.

ON THE DAILY: SHOOT FOR THE STARS

Wednesday, January 17, 2018 — 3A

today’s society. She emphasized 
her multicultural background and 
the influence of her time in Africa 
on her views regarding the current 
political climate of the United 
States. With an Ethiopian mother 
and white Minnesotan father, 
Polgreen said that she thinks a lot 
about American identity in the age 
of Trump.

“But let’s be real — this isn’t 

a normal president, this isn’t 
a normal admin, this isn’t a 
normal 
time,” 
Polgreen 
said. 

“We have what appears to be 
an 
ethnonationalist-influenced 

regime in the White House … we’re 
seeing the rollback of protections 
of queer people like me, we’re 
witnessing a newly permissive 
attitude toward hate-speech and 
hate-crimes that has led to increase 
in attacks on Jews, Muslims and 
all kinds of marginalized peoples. 
We’re also seeing an increase in 
intolerance in some corners of the 
country.” Polgreen stated that 
President Trump attempts to set 
the definition of American identity 
through 
language 
and 
policy. 

Whether it’s his Twitter language 
or his policies on immigration and 
health care, the current presidency 
concerns Polgreen as both a 
journalist and person.

“For me, as the daughter of an 

African immigrant, as a person 
of color, as a queer person, as 
an American, I am watching 
these conversations unfold with 
particular alarm,” Polgreen said.

Polgreen referenced her time 

as 
a 
foreign 
correspondent, 

discussing the lack of free press 
and the presence of government-
controlled press or self-censored 
journalism in other countries. She 
told the audience she spent time 
reading and analyzing the political 
coverage of the last year, and 
wondered if the press did enough 
to recognize the views of Trump 
supporters. She realized the press 
wrote about those people rather 
than for them.

“As a journalist I believe that 

reporting has the power to change 
the world,” Polgreen said. “If the 
media ecosystem like so many 
other institutions has seen this 
extraordinary drift between the 
haves and the have-nots journalism 
has become a highly elite profession 
that often feels extremely distant 
from the experiences of the people 
we write about.” 

Polgreen 
expressed 
concern 

regarding the inequality in the 
United States, referencing Trump’s 
new budget that cuts the Pell Grant 
fund, a grant that provides students 
money for college tuition and does 
not need to be repaid. Polgreen 
herself was the recipient of a Pell 
Grant, and credits this program 

with much of her success.

“Inequality feels baked into our 

society in a way that can’t easily be 
undone and climate change, her 
certain doing, has made it all feel 
super apocalyptic,” she said.

Polgreen 
hopes 
she, 
as 
a 

journalist 
and 
leader 
in 
the 

industry, can be there for those who 
feel that the political and economic 
power range is fundamentally 
unfair. She said she doesn’t feel like 
the press is currently representing 
those voices. In an effort to expand 
the extent of voices represented, 
HuffPost went on a seven-week-
long, 25-city bus tour, hitting 
smaller, central U.S. cities such as 
Fort Wayne, Ind. and Livingston, 
Mo.

Polgreen expected to interview 

about 500 people, but HuffPost 
ended up hearing the voices of close 
to 2,000, asking each person what it 
means to be an American. She said 
that almost no one talked about 
Trump and instead focused on the 
pressing local issues personally 
affecting 
them. 
Polgreen 

recognized the complexity of the 
struggles communities faced and 
how they come together to solve 
problems.

“The experience of traveling 

this country left me optimistic,” 
Polgreen said. “But not optimistic 
in the classic American sense, all 
of those conversations affirmed 
my implacable and old-fashioned 
beliefs that solidarity is possible.”

This discussion of solidarity 

encompasses the unity of people 
in defense of their beliefs. Polgreen 
categorizes solidarity as a great 
strength in times of hardship. 
LSA freshman Aniela Crayton 
discussed what she took away from 
Polgreen’s speech.

“Even if you meet someone who 

has a completely conflicting idea 
than you, it’s important to listen 
to what they have to say and that 
sharing of ideas and conflicting 
opinions allow progress to happen 
in American,” Crayton said.

If the United States had an 

official religion, Polgreen joked that 
it would be amnesia. She discussed 
how Americans like to forget 
the past and focus on the future, 
neglecting how past historical 
events affect current ones. LSA 
freshman Taylor Mitchell said she 
sees this phenomenon of amnesia 
in reference to U.S. history.

“I think from this speech my big 

takeaway was just to acknowledge 
that the United States of America 
is a country that thrives from its 
diversity, and it’s important to 
acknowledge the history of this 
country,” Mitchell said. “We don’t 
like to go back to the hateful history 
of this country but it’s important to 
acknowledge that in order to strive 
for a more progressive future.” 

afford a tutor from a company 
such as Campus Tutors may 
feel stranded by the University 
for not better publicizing the 
financially-accessible resources 
on campus.

One of these individuals is 

LSA sophomore Abbigayl Burtis. 
Burtis admitted while she felt a 
private tutor could have helped 
her overall performance in 
certain courses, cost played a 
role in her decision not to go 
through with it.

“I lacked the time to meet 

with a tutor, and it costs 
money,” Burtis said. “I feel like 
in both calculus and statistics, 
I could have benefited at least 
a bit from a tutor. Not as much 
in calculus, since I was better 
at that subject, but going over 
the material with someone 
who knew it well would have 
improved my performance in 
statistics.”

Burtis 
also 
acknowledged 

while the University does have 
tutoring 
resources, 
students 

might not always know that 
they are available.

“(The University) probably 

(is) good about offering it, 
but they are not so good at 
advertising 
it 
continuously,” 

she said. “I think I remember 
them talking about it at the 

beginning 
of 
the 
semester. 

However, that was not when I 
would have benefited so I did 
not pay attention. I think it 
would be useful if they talked 
about those opportunities more 
throughout the semester.”

Business sophomore Lucas 

Reynolds is both a University 
student and private tutor for 
Campus Tutors. Campus Tutors 
seeks to offer a comprehensive 
review 
of 
lecture 
material 

for courses such as calculus, 
statistics, 
chemistry 
and 

economics. During the reviews, 
students are able to go over 
concepts with a tutor and 
receive 
additional 
practice 

problems and exams. However, 
the company charges around 
about $60 per session.

Reynolds discussed his role 

as a tutor at Campus Tutors. 
Despite his work with Campus 
Tutors, 
Reynolds 
does 
not 

serve as a representative for the 
company.

“My job really is to lead the 

kind of lecture style review 
and answer any questions they 
have, and design the packets,” 
Reynolds said.

Reynolds also admitted even 

though he believes that private 
tutoring 
does 
offer 
added 

benefits for students’ academic 
performance, 
he 
finds 
the 

University to have sufficient 
resources, and has even made 
use of them himself.

“I think the obvious answer is 

yes, private tutoring does offer 
an advantage,” Reynolds said. 
“But I think the University’s 
resources like the Math Lab and 
the Science Learning Center for 
statistics are really great. There 
are free tutoring resources that 
I know I utilized a lot even 
when I took those classes.”

The SLC, which Reynolds 

referenced, is a free resource 
on campus that offers tutoring 
and study groups for students 
enrolled 
in 
natural 
science 

courses within LSA. Located 
in the Chemistry Building, the 
SLC has about 60 tutors on 
staff every semester, and serves 
around 3,000 students through 
its 
Peer-Led 
Study 
Group 

Program. The SLC is currently 
in its fourth year of its drop-in 
tutoring program, and recently 
developed 
a 
mentorship 

program 
to 
help 
students 

pursuing STEM degrees at the 
University.

SLC Director Joe Salvatore 

said he saw the tutoring offered 
through the SLC to be stronger 
than that of a private company. 
Salvatore also echoed Christine 
Modey, 
faculty 
director 
of 

the Peer Writing Consultant 
Program, 
and 
said 
tutors 

provided through University 
resources like the Sweetland 
Center for Writing or the SLC 
are very well trained.

“I would say that I believe 

that 
the 
tutoring 
provided 

by the SLC stands up to the 

quality tutoring that you’d find 
privately or in many of those 
companies,” Salvatore said. “In 
fact, I’d go as far as to say I think 
that quality of our tutoring is 
better than what you’d find in 
the private sector. Part of that 
is because we provide extensive 
training for our tutors.”

In addition to the quality 

of the tutors, the SLC ensures 
they are up to date with 
the 
most 
recent 
research 

regarding learning, and they 
are establishing a welcoming 
environment for all that come 
to receive academic aid through 
their dedication to the DEI 
plan. 

“We send our staff to national 

conferences to learn about what 
other universities and other 
outstanding tutoring programs 
are doing so that we can 
bring those ideas back here,” 
Salvatore said. “We are also 
very committed to DEI, so we 
do a really good job in training 
our tutors on those issues. 
We make sure that whoever 
comes in to get tutoring in our 
center is made to feel welcome 
and supported and that the 
knowledge that they have is 
valued and the belief that they 
can learn anything.”

Salvatore also commented 

on the accessibility of tutoring 
through the SLC. He said there 
were usually tutors ready to 
help students out.

“I would say that our services 

are very accessible,” he said. 
“Students can drop by and get 
tutoring. Often times I’ll go into 
the help room and there are just 
tutors waiting there ready for 
people to help.”

Another 
free 
tutoring 

resource 
offered 
at 
the 

University is the Sweetland 
Center 
for 
Writing, 
which 

seeks to help undergraduate 
and graduate students with 
improving their writing skills. 
The Center currently has 50 
tutors on staff and five locations 
across both Central and North 
Campus and an online presence. 
The 
Center’s 
Peer 
Writing 

Consultant 
Program, 
which 

pairs students with trained 
tutors, has held about 3,600 
appointments this past year.

Modey 
said 
the 
benefits 

of 
utilizing 
the 
service, 

instead of those of a private 
tutoring company, included a 
strong promotion of student 
empowerment and well-trained 
tutors. 

“The things that we offer 

are students who have been 
well trained pedagogically in 
a way that is effective and that 
embodies 
certain 
principles 

among which are: empowering 
students to be in charge of their 
own writing, helping them to 
develop skills that will serve 
them well in future academic 
writing 
and 
future 
writing 

work,” Modey said.

Modey also pointed out since 

the 
peer 
consultants 
were 

typically University students, 
they are more familiar with 
the way courses on campus 
are taught — something that 
may not be true of private 
companies. 

“I think that our consultants 

are really well prepared because 
they’re U-M writers, they’re not 
somebody standing outside the 
University saying, ‘This is what 
it should look like,’” Modey 
said. “They’re people who are 
in the trenches with students, 
and I think that peer-to-peer 
connection can be particularly 
powerful.”

However, 
Burtis 
further 

elaborated on the advantages 
of being able to afford private 
help. She said while being able 
to afford a tutor is beneficial, 
it can also create disparities 
between various income levels 
and academic achievement.

“I think that private tutoring 

is a great resource if you can 
afford it,” Burtis said. “While 
the advantage may just be slight 
for some, it can be large for 
others, so I do think that it does 
give an advantage to those who 
have the expendable money 
to afford it over those who do 
not. I think that differences 
in personal and family income 
make a lot of difference when 
it comes to education, and 
being able to afford additional 
tutoring is a prime example of 
how that happens.”

injuries such as electrical shocks, as 
well as thermal burns.

“On an 82-degree day, a solar 

panel can reach as high as 150 to 168 
degrees and cause serious burns in 
about one second,” Majer said.

While many residents argued 

for the safety of the public, others 
also expressed concern regarding 
the aesthetic nature of the solar 
structures themselves, saying these 
accessories would compromise the 
natural charm and beauty of Ann 
Arbor.

City Council responded to the 

public’s concern by amending 
the 
ordinance 
to 
prohibit 

solar structures in front yards. 
Councilmember 
Jane 
Lumm, 

I-Ward 2, said she agreed with the 
public in their concern regarding 
the solar structures.

“I have received a lot of input 

from residents overwhelmingly 
in opposition,” Lumm said. “It is 
important to indicate that in every 
instance residents have said that 
they are supporters of solar and 
alternate energy sources. Their 
objection is with allowing the solar 
panels in front yards.”

Councilmember 
Zachary 

Ackerman, D-Ward 3, agreed with 
public commenters, moving for an 
amendment to the ordinance.

“I would rather council move in 

a different direction,” Ackerman 
said. “I fundamentally have 
questions about solar structures in 
front yards.”

Amid 
discussions 
regarding 

solar energy solutions in Ann Arbor, 
council members also moved to add 
two new full-time employees to 
positions within the Sustainability 
and Innovation Office of the 
Systems Planning Unit of the Public 
Services Area. While the movement 
to add two new employees passed, 
several council members discussed 
the negative impact this decision 
could have on the budget. Lumm 
expressed her concern the impact 
adding more employees could have 
on the budget process.

“I do not believe we should be 

making budget decisions outside 
of the budget process,” Lumm said. 
“We are making two positions 
permanent that were temporary, 
which is a long-term financial 
commitment.”

Lumm went on to state that 

recent 
employment 
decisions 

have added a heavy burden to the 
general fund.

“Assuming this tonight passes 

we will have added over 20 new city 
staff in the last two years, which is 
adding over $1 million of recurring 
annual costs to the general fund,” 
Lumm said.

Palestine not as a conflict, not as 
an impasse, not as an argument, 
but we should look at it as settler 
colonization,” Salaita said. “Peace, 
actual peace, peace that allows both 
parties to live in dignity can never 
be accomplished under a regime of 
continued settler colonization.”

He also argued colonization in 

the United States has not ended, 
but instead has persisted in today’s 
interactions between the United 
States government and Native 
Americans.

“The idea is that what happened 

to those native nations was tragic, 
or horrendous, but it exists in the 
past and we must come to terms 
with the realities of those horrors 
last century or two centuries 
ago,” Salaita said. “Well, native 
communities, native nations, are 
still around, are still alive, and they 
are still practicing various forms of 
decolonization.”

In comparing the two regions, 

Salaita argued the issues in Israel 
and Palestine today are similar to 
the occupation of Native American 
land in the United States. He 
discussed 
Zionist 
leader 
and 

author Ze’ev Jabotinsky’s essay 
“Iron Wall,” in which Jabotinsky 
asserted the existence of Israel is 
only possible if Palestine does not 
exist.

“The 
Zionist 
movement 

purports to replace one population 
with another population and if you 
don’t have the chest for that sort of 

work then you don’t understand 
the ideology correctly,” Salaita 
said. “And what happened in the 
United States is justified simply by 
the fact that a superior civilization 
replaced an inferior one.”

In an email interview, LSA 

senior Kyla Klein, who attended 
the 
lecture, 
wrote 
Salaita’s 

definition of Zionism simplified 
the ideology and represented the 
entire belief system as one specific 
branch, which she did not see as 
fair to the pro-Israel argument.

“He used Ze’ev Jabotinsky 

to 
describe 
Zionism, 
which 

is actually only one strain of 
Zionism, Revisionist Zionism,” 
Klein 
wrote. 
“This 
Zionism 

is also the most hard-line and 
conservative. 
This 
was 
his 

perspective for his argument 
against Zionism. Regardless if 
one supports Zionism or not, 
Zionism is extremely complex and 
multifaceted.”

Salaita concluded his talk by 

defining his thoughts about what 
Zionism is and then explaining 
what it means to him to work 
against it in the United States 
today. To work against Zionism, 
Salaita offered, is to work against 
injustice everywhere.

“To me, Zionism is a belief, 

whether it’s through a liberal or 
a conservative paradigm, that 
a Jewish majority state ought 
to exist at the expense of those 
who can lay claim to that land 
historically,” Salaita said. “Anti-
Zionism is something that ought 
to 
transcend 
Palestine. 
Anti-

Zionism, when it’s done correctly 

is concerned with the equality and 
the well-being and the dignity of 
all human beings, including the 
Jewish people.”

LSA senior Andrea, who wishes 

to remain anonymous due to safety 
concerns, agreed with Salaita’s 
points and said she could identify 
with him.

“As a Palestinian student, I’ve 

heard about Steven Salaita and I 
can relate to some of the struggles 
he’s been through, also as a 
Palestinian activist,” Andrea said.

Klein wrote she found Salaita’s 

depiction of Jewish people in the 
book to be anti-Semitic, and his 
answer to her question about some 
of his wording disappointing. In 
his book, Salaita describes Jewish 
American students with the phrase 
‘McMansions and shopping malls.’

“I will stand by the line insofar 

as the fact that I am pointing to 
the distinct class dynamic that 
is in play vis-a-vis Palestinians,” 
Salaita said in response to Klein’s 
question.“This is a description of 
college students that gets proffered 
all the time.”

“This language implies that 

Jews are rich and spoiled, a clear 
connection to past descriptions,” 
Klein 
wrote. 
“Sadly, 
instead 

of answering my question, he 
focused on an easy target, which 
was criticizing Taglit-Birthright.”

Though 
back-and-forth 

remained contained to a few 
questions and answers during 
Salaita’s session, two students also 
spoke against Salaita’s appearance 
on campus later Tuesday evening 
at the CSG meeting. 

Daily and CSG reps to my 
knowledge were briefed on the 
incident, I awaited a response 
from you all,” Lawrence said. 
“All I heard, all the Jewish 
community 
heard, 
was 

silence.”

Salaita’s lecture was part of 

the 2018 Reverend Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. Symposium 
hosted by the Center for 
Middle Eastern and North 
African 
Studies. 
Lawrence 

and other Jewish students 
passed out flyers to audience 
members prior to the lecture 
detailing Salita’s 2014 tweets 
that caused the University 
of Illinois to deny his faculty 
appointmentbecause of their 
concerns of his anti-Semitic 
tendencies. The flyers also 
included a definition of anti-
Semitism 
and 
expressed 

their concern with Salaita’s 
endorsement 
of 
anti-

Semitism. 
At 
the 
lecture, 

Salaita acknowledged tweets 
he sent in the midst of the 
2014 Israeli-Gazan conflict at 
the lecture and explained the 
University of Illinois decision 
was based on a malicious 
interpretation of the tweet.

Lawrence urged the body 

to 
reflect 
and 
consider 

action with anti-Semitism on 
campus.

“Anti-Semitism 
takes 

many forms,” Lawrence said. 

“It sometimes looks like a 
swastika. Other times it looks 
like someone using politically 
correct language to discredit 
my legitimacy as part of the 
Jewish people. The inclusive 
community we are trying to 
build at this university will be 
a complete failure if Jews are 
left out.”

Following 
Lawrence’s 

speech, CSG Representative 
Benjamin 
Gerstein, 
an 

LSA freshman, echoed the 
concerns of Lawrence while 
speaking to CSG. Gerstein 
quoted statements made by 
Salaita at his lecture and 
shared his concerns about the 
content.

“Salaita 
was 
given 
a 

platform 
by 
faculty 
and 

repeated the age-old anti-
Semitic statement that world’s 
problems are to be blamed on 
the Jewish people,” Gerstein 
said. “Further, Salaita has 
described as Jewish lives as 
McMansions 
and 
shopping 

malls. Today, he refused to 
walk back these comments 
from his writing, a clear 
connection to the anti-Semitic 
rhetoric 
used 
during 
and 

before the Holocaust.” 

Towards the end of the 

meeting 
LSA 
sophomores 

Haya Akbik and Isabel Baer 
presented 
their 
resolution 

to have CSG sponsor a visit 
from Cherie Brown, a social 
justice dialogue facilitator and 
coalition builder. The purpose 
of Brown’s visit would be to 

help CSG learn how to better 
engage in dialogue regarding 
anti-Semitism 
on 
campus. 

Students 
involved 
in 
CSG 

would be given priority to 
the event, but Akbik and Baer 
did suggest the possibility of 
allowing 
students 
involved 

in outside organizations to 
attend. 

“There 
is 
a 
lot 
of 

misconception 
about 
what 

anti-Semitism looks like in 
the 21st century,” Baer said. 
“It worries me when I see 
swastikas 
drawn 
around 

campus at places such as the 
skate park, the rock, the MLB 
and no one talks about it. As a 
Jewish person on this campus, 
anti-Semitism directly affects 
me; however, it is confusing 
and complicated and I think 
this is an amazing opportunity 
for us as student leaders to 
learn about an issue that is 
not only relevant globally and 
nationally, but also right here 
at the University of Michigan.”

The resolution is still being 

reviewed by CSG and has not 
been voted on yet.

The 
meeting 
concluded 

with a vote on a resolution 
originally 
put 
forth 
last 

semester 
regarding 
CSG 

producing 
a 
statement 
in 

support 
of 
the 
Lecturer’s 

Employee Organization. The 
resolution passed.

F

eeling 
hatred 
is 
a 

given, rejecting it is a 
choice. It is not enough 

to disagree privately; we must 
vocally 
remind 
ourselves 

that every person has value, 
regardless of origin.

My friends from shithole 

countries 
were 
pretty 

incensed by the president’s 
comments last week. When 
I first heard his words, I 
stopped for a second and 
wondered 
if 
Egypt, 
my 

country of origin, would be 
considered a shithole country 
by his standards.

It’s safe to say that without 

the pyramids, Egypt certainly 
would be among the brown 
and 
black 
countries 
that 

Trump, and many people, 
find inferior. But, with this 
designation comes a certain 
sense 
of 
pride 
because 

I 
know 
that 
immigrants 

will persevere despite this 
perception of us.

Yet I can’t always shake 

the way the president’s words 
resonante with me when I look 
in the mirror. Sometimes, I do 
feel like I’m from a shithole 
country. I see violence, the 
restriction of freedoms and a 
lack of prosperity.

What 
I 
must 
remind 

myself is that every country 
struggles 
on 
some 
levels 

with these issues. There are 
historical 
and 
sociological 

reasons for the circumstances 
of each country. Although 
we can’t always mute self-
hatred, it’s our responsibility 
to respond to it with positive 
reinforcement—both for our 
own sake and for others.

I thank God every day that 

my parents immigrated to 
America. Because of that, I 
was born in what is, for me, 
the greatest country in the 
world. However, with that 
blessing comes a lot of strings.

America 
has 
a 
way 
of 

reminding you of all the ways 
you’re different. This isn’t 
always a bad thing, and the 
individuality and creativity 
it promotes is part of what 
makes it great. Still, I know 
from 
personal 
experience 

how easy it is to conflate 
being different with being 
less.

A sense of belonging is not 

the most natural impulse 
when nobody in your lecture 
hall looks like you. It’s hard to 
feel heard by representatives 
who don’t tune in to your 
narrative. 
Caring 
about 

headlines 12 time zones away, 
asking your parents questions 
about America they don’t know 
the answer to; it’s part of the 
territory of being an immigrant.

It builds character, and I’m 

at peace with the difficulty 
of it. I believe it makes me 
a 
stronger 
person, 
more 

ready to raise kids here and 
continue the experiment of 
being an American.

We learn every day just 

how 
heterogeneous 
our 

society can be, and how many 
different walks of life can be 
accommodated 
peacefully 

instead of rejected violently. 
What it means to be American 
is always in contention, and 
our responsibility is to affect 
that meaning positively.

I’m not personally upset 

at what the president said 
because 
that’s 
how 
many 

people 
feel. 
I’m 
upset 

because, for a moment, I felt 
the inferiority that somebody 
else 
determined 
for 
me. 

The young immigrants who 
hear these remarks may feel 
worse about themselves, and 
all of us – whether we were 
born here or not – might fail 
to reassure them that these 
voices of self-hatred are false.

How much worse would my 

mom feel, as a child-arrival 
bullied for the food she ate 
and the clothes she couldn’t 
afford, 
if 
her 
president 

reaffirmed 
the 
negative 

feedback she was getting at 
school? Would my dad find 
the same success if he saw 
other immigrants as rivals 
instead of allies?

I can imagine both of 

them being invigorated by 
the 
president’s 
comments, 

as my friends are today. It’s 
not impossible to succeed in 
this country as a minority, 
but self-hatred fuels those 
moments of ambiguity when 
I question whether or not 
I belong here. Even though 
it’s unhealthy, it’s natural to 
question whether I can fit 
in and stand out at the same 
time.

I wouldn’t run into these 

feelings if I never left Egypt. 
But America is the greatest 
country in the world for 
me because it has potential 
beyond any other. America’s 
core values are ambitious and 
future-oriented; the spirit of 
self-improvement is woven 
into our flag. No country is 
quite like us in our melting-
pot culture and our character 
of accommodation.

Yes, such grand visions are 

easy to fail, and quite often 
they’ve backfired horribly. 
It’s 
easy 
to 
contemplate 

giving up, settling for the 
kind of homogenous, closed-
off country we’re used to 
reading about in history — 
the same country some of 
my neighbors crave, where 
everyone is from the same 
shithole country instead of 
many.

Until 
the 
moment 
I’m 

dragged off this soil, I’ll 
continue demonstrating my 
value to this country. It’s a 
shame that the success of 
immigrants is political, but 
it’s on us to see in ourselves 
and in each other that we 
belong here.

targeting 
women, 

minorities 
and 
other 

vulnerable populations 

through his tweets and public 
comments, President 
Trump has begun to 
cement his legacy as 
a bully more than a 
role model, despite 
being in office for less 
than one year.

Last week, Trump 

added to his history 
of crude and overtly 
prejudiced comments 
at a White House 
meeting with select 
senators 
regarding 
various 

immigration policies, including 
the status of the Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals 
program, put in place by 
former 
President 
Barack 

Obama in 2012.

When asked by Senator Dick 

Durbin, D-Ill., whether certain 
countries 
like 
Haiti 
could 

receive Temporary Protected 
Status for their undocumented 
immigrants living in the United 
States, CNN confirmed Trump 
said, “Why do we need more 
Haitians? 
Take 
them 
out.” 

In an even more egregious 
act of racism, Trump went 
on to describe immigrants 
from Africa as coming from 
“shithole 
countries,” 
a 

statement that was not denied 
by White House spokesperson 
Raj Shah when asked about it 
the following evening.

At 
first 
glance 
these 

statements are shocking, but at 
this point, should be expected 
from a president whose power is 
predicated on the subjugation of 
outsiders who present a threat to 
his vision of a white, patriarchal 
society. And until this racism 
is wiped from the country’s 
core institutions, these types 
of comments from the nation’s 
leader will only perpetuate this 
system of inequality.

Above all, DACA is a measure 

of 
inclusivity 
and 
empathy 

overshadowed and mitigated by 
the generally tough immigration 
policy supported by the Trump 

administration.

By 
granting 

undocumented 
immigrants 
protection 
from 

immediate 
deportation 
and 

the right to work 
and 
study, 
DACA 

highlights 
the 

empathy with which 
Obama 
understood 

the 
desperate 

situation of many children from 
economically 
and 
politically 

decimated countries who have 
known nothing but America 
since immigrating here at a 
young age.

Many factors might explain 

the divergence between Obama 
and 
Trump’s 
philosophy 

on 
DACA, 
which 
Trump 

announced he would begin to 
phase out after the proposed 
bipartisan 
deal 
presented 

a “big step backwards” for 
immigration policy and the 
country’s spending deficit.

One 
powerful 
factor 

that cannot be ignored in 
explaining this dichotomy is 
race, though it is one that is 
frequently neglected because 
of its controversial nature. 
Trump’s “shithole” comments, 
undoubtedly 
fueled 
by 
an 

underlying prejudice against 
minorities, 
represent 
a 

pervasive problem in a country 
that prides itself on inclusion 
and democracy.

Recently in one of my classes, 

Islam in Africa, we watched a 
Ted Talk by Nigerian writer 
Chimamanda 
Adichie 
called 

“The Danger of a Single Story.” 
Adichie’s lecture has become a 
popular teaching tool for many 
historians 
and 
sociologists 

as a way to highlight the 
consequences 
of 
racial 

stereotypes and generalizations.

Adichie recalled that when 

she moved from Nigeria to the 
United States to attend college, 
she was shocked by the reaction 
of her American roommate. 
Not only did the roommate ask 
to listen to Adichie’s African 
“tribal music,” but also assumed 
that she did not know how to 
use a stove.

While 
these 
demeaning 

generalizations may be in part 
due to individual prejudice, it 
is equally if not more a result of 
institutional racism embedded 
in our schools, media and politics.

The very course in which 

I heard this story is not only 
an objective introduction to 
the history of Islam in Africa, 
but an attempt to tear down 
the 
misunderstandings 
and 

stereotypes attached to each 
of these topics, the type of 
sentiment held by President 
Trump 
and 
many 
others 

who see Africa and Haiti as 
“shithole” countries without 
the 
means 
necessary 
to 

function in the modern world.

Until America as a whole 

is educated in more than one 
“story” of Africa, Haiti and 
all 
other 
countries 
whose 

refugees are seeking a better 
life in the United States, the 
racism demonstrated by Trump 
will continue to appear in both 
everyday life and political policy.

It then becomes the task of 

us as students to not only learn, 
but to educate others in a way 
that emphasizes diversity and 
inclusion. Trump’s comments 
will surely perpetuate racist 
ideology in the United States, 
but a strong opposition to this 
rhetoric through education and 
wholesome 
media 
coverage 

may reverse the flow of this 
anti-immigrant philosophy.

Racism in practice

P

rior 
to 
last 
week’s 

college 
football 

national championship 

game, 
President 
Donald 

Trump 
took 

the 
field 
for 

the 
national 

anthem. 
White 

House 
officials 

likely 
hoped 

the 
appearance 

would help boost 
an 
embattled 

president, but the 
plan 
backfired 

when TV cameras 
caught 
Trump 

mumbling 
as 

he 
sang 
along, 

leading many observers to 
conclude that Trump did not 
know the words. The outcry 
was swift and harsh.

For the record, I am not 

convinced 
that 
Trump 

forgot the national anthem’s 
lyrics. The footage seems 
to show a man somewhat 
awkwardly trying to appear 
presidential 
on 
national 

television rather than a man 
struggling to remember the 
words. But either way, a more 
interesting, and far more 
consequential 
question 
is 

this: how important is it for 
presidents and other political 
leaders to know aspects of 
our civic culture, like the 
national anthem?

Suppose 
Trump 
did 

indeed 
forget 
the 
lyrics: 

Was the deluge of criticism 
that 
followed 
merely 
an 

instance of liberals trying 
to score political points, or 
was it a warranted critique? 
I contend it’s the latter. 
Admittedly, 
knowing 
the 

national anthem’s lyrics will 
not boost the economy. It 
won’t fix health care, nor will 
it thwart terrorism. But not 
knowing the words would 
be an affront to our nation’s 
civic culture, which can be 
loosely defined as respect, 
admiration and knowledge 
of our country’s democratic 
values, history and system 
of governance. The national 
anthem is a celebration of our 
civic culture, but this civic 
culture is arguably in decline

Last fall, researchers at the 

University of Pennsylvania’s 
Annenberg 
Public 
Policy 

Center conducted a survey 
on Americans’ knowledge of 
the government and the U.S. 
Constitution, and the results 
were less than impressive. 

A third of the country could 
not name any of the three 
branches of government and 
only a quarter could identify 

all three. They also 
found 
37 
percent 

could not name a 
single civil liberty 
protected under the 
First 
Amendment, 

and none of the First 
Amendment 
rights 

were identified by 
more than half of 
respondents.

For 
what 
it 
is 

worth, 
a 
separate 

ABC poll found 60 
percent of Americans 

don’t 
know 
the 
national 

anthem’s lyrics. Moreover, 
the country’s ignorance of 
basic civics seems to be on the 
upswing. The Annenberg poll 
has been conducted annually 
since 2011, and the results 
have shown a steady decline 
in the civic knowledge of 
Americans. The concept of 
civic knowledge is two-fold, 
involving 
both 
practical 

topics like the provisions of 
the Constitution and more 
symbolic matters like the 
national 
anthem, 
but 
the 

polling suggests Americans 
largely 
don’t 
know 
much 

about either.

Frankly, these figures are 

depressing 
and 
alarming. 

An educated electorate is 
essential to the health of 
a modern democracy. The 
Founding Fathers were well 
aware of this and feared 
the irrational decisions of 
an ignorant populace. Some 
forefathers 
believed 
the 

solution was to limit the 
role 
of 
everyday 
citizens 

in governance, leading the 
drafters of the Constitution 
to create institutions like 
the 
Electoral 
College, 

the 
indirect 
election 
of 

senators and voting rights 
restrictions. 
Others, 
like 

Thomas Jefferson, believed 
the 
political 
participation 

of average citizens to be 
imperative in an egalitarian 
society and saw the education 
of the masses as the cure to 
an 
ill-informed 
electorate. 

Jefferson’s 
commitment 
to 

this goal led him to found the 
University of Virginia with the 
purpose to educate Americans 
to better our democracy after 
his presidency.

Fortunately, in the centuries 

since the Constitution’s ratification, 

we 
have 
endorsed 
Jefferson’s 

view and gradually eliminated 
voting rights restrictions and 
other 
roadblocks 
to 
true 

representative 
democracy. 

But in order for Jefferson’s 
vision to be realized, we 
must commit ourselves to 
being informed, responsible 
citizens, which begins with 
knowing rudimentary civics. 
Though ignorance towards 
civics 
does 
not 
directly 

translate 
to 
ignorance 

towards policy, voters are 
unlikely to make reasoned 
decisions at the ballot box 
if they do not even know 
how the government works. 
Though 
this 
lens, 
civic 

ignorance constitutes a real 
threat to political efficacy, 
since 
research 
suggests 

the 
less 
people 
know 

about government, the less 
confidence they have in it.

Trump’s national anthem 

mumbling 
raises 
another 

concern: the possibility that 
civic ignorance, that is a lack 
of knowledge and even a lack 
of regard for basic civics, 
could spread to our leaders. 
Politicians are rational actors, 
and if voters don’t care about 
their civic knowledge, neither 
will candidates for public 
office, which will presumably 
lead to ignorant leaders. We 
should want our political 
leaders to be knowledgeable 
about the Constitution, our 
country’s history and other 
elementary civics. However, 
even assuming we want this 
in principle, we need to know 
civics ourselves if we are to 
determine if candidates do.

Who 
knows 
if 
Trump 

knows 
the 
words 
of 
the 

national anthem. What is 
clear is that most of us don’t, 
and our blissful ignorance 
extends far beyond that to 
serious matters of law and 
governance. This is not to 
suggest that learning about 
our 
government 
is 
some 

magical fix to our nation’s 
problems, but rather that 
our nation’s ignorance is a 
problem in itself and one 
worth fixing. The loss of 
civic 
knowledge 
reflects 

a 
corrosion 
of 
America’s 

civic culture, and it is our 
collective responsibility as a 
country to rectify it.

“Marie Antoinette” is Sofia 
Coppola’s 
masterpiece. 
“The 
Virgin Suicides” is the cult classic 
of the “Donnie Darko” crowd, 
“Lost in Translation” gets all the 
critical attention, but it’s “Marie 
Antoinette” that best showcases 
the ineffability of her visual wit. It’s 
a lush, pastel coming-of-age story 
that sees one of the most infamous 
figures in Western history as a 
person — not wholly good or bad, 
but young and unprepared. It’s 
about glut and greed, but it’s also 
about the loneliness of teenage 
years. All that and the soundtrack 
slaps.
Coppola crafts — by pairing 
the dying days of the French 
monarchy with the restless sounds 
of post-punk and new wave — a 
tension between sound and image 
that perfectly mirrors the inner 
turmoil of adolescence. Marie 
Antoinette the person stands 
in the face of everything these 
music movements are. “Marie 
Antoinette” the movie puts them 
in tandem, pairing the material 
excess of Versailles with the sonic 
exactitude of The Strokes and New 
Order.
We can draw a distinction 
between the character and her 
historical 
counterpart 
because 
Coppola isn’t making a factual 
biopic, she’s making an emotional 
one. 
In 
“Marie 
Antoinette,” 
she builds a Versailles that is 
at once suffocatingly full and 
excruciatingly lonely, and then 
sits in it. For two hours, she tracks 
her protagonist (a tour de force 
performance from Kirsten Dunst) 
as she roams the grounds, pushing 
the boundaries of what the Queen 
of France can do and be.
This unlikely union is most 
in sync at the heart of the film in 
which Marie suggests she and 
her entourage sneak away from 
Versailles to attend a masked ball 
in Paris. As she enters the ball — 
looking decadently goth in an all-
black ensemble — strings pluck 

softly. You think, “Wait I know 
this … is this …?” And it is. A string 
intro to “Hong Kong Garden” by 
Siouxsie and the Banshees that 
explodes into its original form as 
Marie enters the swirling mass of 
dancers. For a second, as bodies 
whirl around each other, it looks 
like a pit.
The restless joy of the night 
mirrors the song Coppola chooses 
to score it. “Hong Kong Garden” 
has been called the most important 
early post-punk hit. The song was 
born out Siouxsie Sioux and John 

McKay’s love of a restaurant — the 
Hong Kong Garden — and hatred 
for the “skinheads” who populated 
it. Marie finds herself at the 
crossroads of the same emotional 
extremes in this scene. She loves 
being at the ball, but hates being 
there with her husband and the 
boring company he keeps.
This is, perhaps, why Marie 
emerges as sympathetic despite 
her wasteful and careless lifestyle. 
She is lonely and her yearning is 
palpable. She wants what everyone 
wants: to understand and be 
understood. Late in the film, she 
drifts through a quiet boring 
party. Tired of feigning interest, 
she excuses herself and bursts into 
the cold, endless halls of Versailles. 
The opening chords of “What Ever 
Happened?” burst with her.
The opening track on The 
Strokes’s sophomore (and best) 
album Room on Fire, the song 
begins with the declaration: “I 
want to be forgotten.” Which 

she does, at this moment. Marie 
longs — like all good teens — to be 
outside her life. For the Queen of 
France, that means to disappear 
from the public consciousness, to 
be freed by anonymity. The tension 
between wanting to be forgotten 
and admired, to be free but also 
seen are exemplified by the song.
This party is presented in 
contrast to Marie’s birthday, a few 
scenes earlier. This party —scored 
by New Order’s “Ceremony” — is 
characteristically youthful and 
bursting at the seams with energy 
and joy.
The soundtrack is the perfect 
representation 
of 
Marie’s 
subjectivity. Her emotional core 
is made manifest in the music 
Coppola uses to score her. To 
pick songs that can be loosely 
tied by this nondescript label 
of post-punk is genius. Part of 
what made this thing I’m calling 
post-punk 
different 
from 
the 
punk that preceded it is a self-
aware recognition of the joy that 
can come out of anger. It’s the 
thrill of being young and mad 
and confused. The frustration of 
pushing against the boundaries of 
a world that can feel terribly small, 
and the rush of excitement that 
comes from pushing.
“Marie Antoinette” is Coppola’s 
masterpiece because she manages 
to operate in two eras at once, a feat 
that is more complex than pairing 
incongruent music and images. 
Coppola imagines Marie as a 
teenage girl in 2006 with an early 
generation iPod. She feels trapped 
by the suburban life her parents 
chose for her. She hates them, but 
she gravitates towards the music 
they grew up on (New Order, The 
Cure) and artists who take after 
them (The Strokes). She’s a roiling, 
volatile, confused teenage girl who 
can’t understand why she was born 
into the body she’s in. Teenage 
emotions, Coppola discovers, exist 
even within the hedge mazes and 
Baroque ballrooms of Versailles.

‘Marie Antoinette’ has 
the perfect soundtrack

‘Search Party’ & ‘The End’ convey despair via music

I spent a good half of this past 
weekend 
binge-watching 
the 
latest season of TBS’s “Search 
Party” 
and 
Netflix’s 
newest 
series “The End of the F***ing 
World.” The former is a witty 
murder 
mystery 
about 
four 
Manhattan 20-somethings, led 
by the anxiety-riddled Dory (Alia 
Shawkat, “Transparent”), who 
struggle to cope after having 
accidentally killed an innocent 
private investigator in search of 
their missing friend. The latter 
is a twisted British comedy that 
follows two teenagers — one a 
self-identified psychopath (Alex 
Lawther, “Black Mirror”) and 
the other a coarse misanthrope 
(Jessica Barden, “The Lobster”) 
— who decide to embark on a 
road trip to escape their boring 
hometown.
Having 
engrossed 
myself 
in both shows in such a short 
span of time, I couldn’t help but 
notice that “Search Party” and 
“The End of the F***ing World” 
share more than just a sick sense 
of humor and young, conflicted 
protagonists fed up with life’s 
mediocrity. Like any good TV 
soundtrack, the music curated 
on each show plays a hugely 
influential role in informing 

us about the inner turmoil of 
the 
characters, 
articulating 
the motivations behind their 
actions and the emotions buried 
underneath. More specifically, 
the particular type of music used 
in “Search Party” and “The End 
of the F***ing World” illuminates 
the humanity of the ostensibly 
irredeemable protagonists, each 
of whom are, coincidentally, 
guilty of committing murder.
For a program like “The End of 
the F***ing World,” you’d expect 
the soundtrack to be filled with 
venomous punk rock in the style 
of The White Stripes, The Clash 
or even Green Day to match the 
rebellious angst of its central 
couple, James (Lawther) and 
Alyssa 
(Barden). 
Surprisingly, 
however, the show takes a much 
more unconventional approach in 
regards to music genre. Over the 
course of the first season, each 
episode is peppered with a diverse 
musical palette — sweeping doo-
wop ballads, romantic acoustic 
rock and dreamy French pop. 
It’s a bit jarring, especially 
for a show where the two main 
characters are criminally insane, 
dangerous 
and 
frequently 
insufferable — think “Moonrise 
Kingdom” meets “Natural Born 
Killers.” But underneath the 
surface of the show’s cynicism, 
the 
light-hearted 
soundtrack 
benefits 
James 
and 
Alyssa’s 

cause for acting out. “The End of 
the F***ing World” establishes 
this right from the start: In the 
first episode, James explains 
his psychopathy as Bernadette 
Carroll’s 
“Laughing 
on 
the 
Outside” plays in the background, 
and later, Alyssa explains her 
misanthropy over the sorrowful 
tune “Where is the Love” by the 
Monzas. Both songs sonically and 
lyrically ache with such forlorn 
tenderness that it’s impossible not 
to feel sympathy for these two and 
how they grew to be so alienated 
from the world around them. 
The music offers a more tangible 
understanding of James and 
Alyssa’s shared suffering — absent 
parents, 
loneliness, 
childhood 
trauma — that would otherwise 
seem dull or trite if the music was 
edgier and more on-the-nose.
Other 
important 
scenes 
are made only more poignant, 
romantic and clever with the 
undercurrent 
of 
music 
cues. 
When James and Alyssa break and 
enter into a stranger’s mansion in 
episode three, they dance to Hank 
Williams’s “Settin’ the Woods on 
Fire,” having just blown up their 
car in the previous episode. Later 
on, James stabs the stranger, who 
attempts to strangle Alyssa after 
catching her in his bed, while 
singer Brenda Lee croons her 
1960 single “I’m Sorry.” The two 
frame the murder in the next

episode to the tune of Timi Yuro’s 
cover of Charlie Chaplin’s “Smile.”
Perhaps these jingles are only 
meant to soften the blow of the 
show’s disturbing, grisly violence. 
I’d argue it serves a greater 
emotional purpose: The music 
not only literalizes the shock 
and despair James and Alyssa 
experience in these situations, but 
it also excavates the innocence 
concealed beneath the darkness 
of their actions. Their love for one 
another intensifies, even as they 
stray further away from sanity. 
This idea continues onto episode 
four, 
where 
James’s 
woeful 
monologue about the loudness of 
silence feels all the more potent 
with the sound of Ricky Nelson’s 
“Lonesome Town.” The scene 
marks the first time James and 
Alyssa are separated, and we can 
actually start to feel heartbreak 
for both characters as Nelson 
sings, “There’s a place where 
lovers go / To cry their troubles 
away / And they call it lonesome 
town 
/ 
Where 
the 
broken 
hearts stay.” Being a confused, 
frustrated teenager often does 
feel like the end of the world, but 
the soundtrack for this off-kilter 
coming-of-age story offers hope 
and guidance for lost souls like 
James and Alyssa. 
As for “Search Party,” the music 
choices are a bit more subtle, 
but still just as effective. Like 

“The End of the F***ing World,” 
one would guess that “Search 
Party” would incorporate a more 
indie rock-based soundtrack to 
reflect the stylings of its hipster-
millennial characters. Instead, 
the show opts for a more ambient 
electronica sound, using songs 
by obscure chillwave musicians 
Boga, Tender, Little Ashes and 
Roosevelt. Sometimes, the music 
is used as a tool for comedic 
irony — Beat Club’s “Something 
Better” provokes an impromptu 
dance party in the season two 
opener, as Dory and her friends 
mask the guilt and shame of 
killing the private investigator 
Keith Powell (Ron Livingston, 
“Loudermilk”) just hours before. 
Other 
times, 
“Search 
Party” 
relies on the glum, melancholy 
synths of its soundtrack to evoke 
the fear stirring within the four 
friends as they suppress the truth. 
In the last shot of episode two, 
Dory and her friends contemplate 
the repercussions of lying about 
murdering Keith, sitting solemnly 
in the car as Fear of Men’s “Sane” 
lingers in the background. The 
title of the song pretty much says 
it all.
These music choices affect 
Dory in particular, who, since 
season one, has experienced a 
quarter-life crisis of listlessness 
and anhedonia, heightened even 
more by the trauma of killing 

Keith and subsequently burying 
him with her friends to cover 
up their tracks. The dirty regret 
bubbling inside Dory culminates 
into an all-time low in the seventh 
episode 
when 
she 
envisions 
jumping off a rooftop to Tender’s 
“Belong” — a song that mirrors 
her terror of being found out, 
especially with lyrics like, “No 
I don’t belong, to anyone / But I 
wish I did / Then maybe I won’t 
feel the shame.”
Strangely enough, the music 
in “Search Party” and “The 
End 
of 
the 
F***ing 
World” 
ruminates on very similar ideas 
about how scared people in this 
generation are to confront their 
own existence. Dory, James and 
Alyssa repress not only the truth 
about the mistakes they made, 
but also who they are as people. 
None of them feel like they can 
live up to societal expectations, 
and instead of reckoning with 
the issue upfront, they do their 
best to bottle everything up as 
much as possible, often leading to 
disastrous consequences. But the 
soundtracks in both shows do their 
best to validate the remorse these 
characters face. Music itself can 
often be a cushion for characters 
like these, just as it can be a source 
of solace for people who feel just 
as lost, angry, misunderstood 
and burdened with a need to do 
everything right.

TV NOTEBOOK

‘Post’ is a timely thrill

Steven Spielberg (“Bridge of 
Lies”) is the de facto storyteller 
for inspirational American tales, 
ranging from the life of Abraham 
Lincoln to the European invasion 
of World War II. “The Post,” his 
recent recount of the publishing 
of The Pentagon Papers, is no 
different. With a star-studded 
cast, larger-than-life characters 
and the typical Spielberg-esque 
flair, “The Post” recaptures the 
bravery necessary to confront a 
corrupt government and expose its 
shameful secrets.
Richard 
Nixon’s 
tenure 
as 
president is only increasingly 
relevant today as we trudge 
through the daily drudgery of a 
Donald Trump presidency loaded 
with bigotry, lies and distrust of 
the media. History repeats itself, 
and Spielberg’s efforts to retell past 
dilemmas to teach us about the 
present are not fruitless. Someone 
of such influence and talent — 
Spielberg, that is — is the perfect 
person to educate those born 
before the early ’70s about such 
paranoia and hatred toward a free 
press. 
Beyond the movie’s timeliness, it 
boasts a thrilling yet slow-burning 
story that, despite a rather dull 
beginning, displays the virtues 
of doing what is right rather than 

what is easy. After The New York 
Times publishes an article exposing 
government cover-ups and lies 
regarding the Vietnam War, The 
Washington Post rushes to match 
their competitor’s content. Ben 

Bradlee (Tom Hanks, “Bridge of 
Spies”), editor-in-chief for The 
Post, fights to publish government 
documents revealing a reluctance 
to withdraw from Vietnam despite 
clear signs of imminent failure. 
Alongside Bradlee is the paper’s 
new publisher Kay Graham (Meryl 
Streep, “Florence Foster Jenkins”) 
— the first woman to hold such a 
position — who refuses to appease 
her disobedient board filled with 
multiple men breathing down her 
neck. 
Liz Hannah and Josh Singer’s 
(“Spotlight”) screenplay is the 
ideal 
match 
for 
Spielberg’s 
grand directorial style. It avoids 
complexity in favor of a more 
straightforward 
storytelling 
approach. The script’s good versus 
evil trope is different from the 
more typical “America is good” 
and others are “bad” approach 
some of the director’s other films 

follow. Here, the government is the 
antagonist, while the reporters are 
the protagonists. Regardless, “The 
Post” is as pro-American as a movie 
could possibly be, highlighting the 
fundamental role the press plays in 
preserving democracy. 
“The Post” would not be as 
strong of a movie without standout 
performances from Streep and 
Sarah Paulson (“American Crime 
Story”), who, in limited screen 
time, takes over in some of the 
movie’s essential moments. Bob 
Odenkirk (“Better Call Saul”) 
comes alive as Ben Bagdikian, a 
reporter who played an integral 
role in receiving and publishing 
The 
Pentagon 
Papers. 
As 
a 
movie that heavily relies on the 
performances rather than large-
scale CGI and special effects, all 
actors do their part in ensuring 
success. Even Hanks, who I don’t 
always find to be that talented, does 
his job with passion and ease. He 
portrays Bradlee as the cowboy of 
the beltway — the journalist with a 
growling voice eager to go against 
the establishment. 
For a movie that everyone 
already knows the ending to, “The 
Post” manages to fully engulf 
us into the world of early ’70s 
journalism. Despite a somewhat 
unnecessary final moment, we feel 
comfort in knowing that corrupt 
administrations filled with secrets 
will finally be brought down. To 
me, that’s reassuring for our future.

‘Jane’ paints a sumptuous 
portrait of a living legend

“Jane,” 
the 
latest 
documentary 
from 
director 
Brett Morgen (“Kurt Cobain: 
Montage of Heck”), is nothing 
short of a small miracle. First, 
there’s the fact that the film is 
the product of a hundred hours 
of prime footage once thought to 
be lost before being discovered 
in 2014. Second, the subject of 
the footage, the conservation 
biologist and chimp researcher 
Jane Goodall, whom everyone 
knows 
but 
no 
one 
knows 
really anything about, is a 

mesmerizing figure with a story 
long-worthy of telling.
But let’s start with the 
logistics. 
In 
her 
mid-20s, 
Goodall, fascinated by nature 
but not tinged by academic 
orthodoxy, was directed by her 
employer to travel to Africa to 
conduct observational research 
on primates. She went to the 
Gombe in 1960, which sits at 
the western edge of Tanzania 
(it has since become a national 
park). Accompanied by her 
mother, Goodall began a study 
of the chimpanzees in the park, 
at first keeping her distance but 
then over time moving closer 
and closer. 
The 
footage, 
captured 
mostly by Hugo van Lawick, 
a 
Dutch 
photographer 
for 

National 
Geographic 
who 
himself becomes a character 
in Goodall’s life, is stunning. 
There’s a reason van Lawick 
got his coveted job, and the 
film is at its best when it lets 
the footage speak for itself. 
Extreme 
close-ups 
on 
the 
insects creeping and crawling 
among the grass, dusk shots 
of Goodall sitting against the 
darkening sky, chimps slipping 
somewhat 
lackadaisically 
through towering trees. Not 
to mention the color, which 
is rich as the finest works of 
Fauvism. When the color fades 
into gruesomely edited black-
and-white 
sequences, 
which 
are thankfully rare in the film’s 
brisk 90-minute running time, 
“Jane” loses most of its luster. 
That’s not to say that the 
film offers nothing by way of 
the 
traditional 
biographical 
documentary. The 83-year-old 
Goodall’s eloquent narration, 
constructed 
partly 
from 
interviews with Morgen and 
partly from her own writing, 
allows us to exist inside her 
wonder-filled 
young 
mind. 
Morgen’s interview questions 
verge on unimaginative, but 
Goodall’s responses are ever-
enlightening peeks into one 
of the 20th century’s most 
revered 
figures. 
Overlaying 
Goodall’s writings, read aloud 
by the woman herself, over 
actual footage of her young self 
is magical. A freak accident of 
discovery and timing, sure, but 
it’s a treasure nonetheless.
The score by famed composer 
Philip 
Glass 
(“Visitors”) 
is 
gorgeous, if overpowering at 
times. Often, it can tie in a 
sense of tragedy where it does 
not seem to exist, a complaint 
I’ve had about numerous Glass 
scores, but here, it’s a minor 

quibble. The score contains at 
its core a sense of wondrous 
fascination and discovery, or 
perhaps nearing it. It’s elegant 
and though I wonder what the 
film would be like with zero 
score, with scored only by the 
sounds of nature, my hunch is 
that van Lawick’s cameras were 
not designed to capture noise. 
Glass is a nice consolation.
Far 
from 
conventional, 
“Jane” transmutes a simple 

biographical tale into a fully 
immersive 
and 
sensory 
experience. In fact, the film’s 
allegiance 
to 
completing 
her biography can come at 
the expense of experiencing 
Jane’s life. Those moments 
of truth — not biography but 
documentary at its core — are 
so fundamentally moving that 
to turn away from the chimps 
crawling around each other, or 
Goodall raising her son Grub 
in Gombe, or Goodall laughing 
with van Lawick, just feels 
wrong. 
Fortunately, 
Morgen 
chooses to stick with the footage 
much of the time. Lucky us.

FILM REVIEW

“This is the first time I’ve 
written to you / and I know 
now why they call me little 
witch.”
In “Solve for Desire,” a slim 
collection of poems, Caitlin 
Bailey imagines and explores 
the lives of Georg Trakl and 
his younger sister Grete, to 
whom Bailey dedicates the 
work. Georg Trakl was a late 
19th-century 
Austrian 
poet 
who struggled with addiction, 
served in the army, attempted 
suicide and died of a drug 
overdose that may have been 
intentional. Grete committed 
suicide at a party a few years 
later. The extent of their 
relationship is unknown.
The poems in “Solve for 
Desire” are consumed with 
the wells of wanting that lie 
underneath our more innocent, 
more 
easily 
articulated 
wishes. She examines both 
savage desire and raw grief, 
wondering how memories of 
ourselves exist in words on 
both sides. “Pigeons” considers 
the jarring dissonance between 

literal anatomy, emotional pain 
and the instability of them 
both. “Poem About Desire,” 
a slight 22 words, captures 
the fiercely inconsequential 
beauty of small things, of 
runaway moments crystallized 
in amber. The final few lines 
of “The Heart is to a Pleasant 
Thing,” 
without 
directly 
referencing 
its 
subject 
matter, 
reproduces 
the 
moment 
that 
uncertainty 
hardens 
into 
determination in 
someone’s 
eyes. 
“Right 
Light” 
finds the hint of 
hope found in the 
circumlocution of 
a prophecy. More than a few 
poems feel eerily reminiscent 
of the language of incantations, 
echoing cadences that have 
slipped through our memories.
The poems do not wander; 
they stay intensely focused on 
their subjects. A few images are 
woven throughout the whole 
collection. Palms, wrists and 
necks are referenced several 
times; snake imagery lies coiled 
throughout. Occasionally, the 

unpredictability of a phrase 
verges on a lack of clarity, 
and 
the 
introduction 
of 
enjambment in later poems is 
startling. But eventually, they 
coalesce into a communication 
of the visceral ache of loving 
someone 
who 
wishes 
for 
deliverance; the misery of 
wanting to tell them about it 
when they aren’t 
there to listen; 
the 
struggle 
to 
translate 
wounds 
into 
words.
Desire 
can 
dwindle and it 
can die. That’s 
not 
Bailey’s 
concern. Rather, 
she focuses on 
how desire can consume like a 
flame held to a piece of paper 
dipped in oil, leaving nothing 
but a trace of smoke. She’s 
painting the oily gradient of 
darker desires, the eroticism 
of an inappropriate possession 
that verges on a question more 
weighted than being ready to 
die for someone: being ready 
to live for them. It’s a question 
that will never — and maybe 
shouldn’t — be solved.

Young Thug is the king

Yaaah-ahoooo! 
Inewanewanewanev 
like. 
Inewaevery single girl, betcha. 
Inewasmoke-daddywholeword 
nada. Yaaah-ahoooo!
The gibberish above is my 
interpretation of a melody in the 
song “Feel It” by Young Thug. 
On paper, the hodgepodge of 
vowels and consonants reads 
like absolute nonsense, but on 
the track, Thug is able to string 
these 
relatively 
nonsensical 
sounds together to develop a 
melody so interesting that his 
voice essentially becomes an 
instrument. Young Thug is the 
melody master of mumble rap, 
but also much more; he is the 
saving grace of the fledgling 
genre.
Today’s mainstream rap is 
dominated by warbling and 
mumbling. Stars like 21 Savage 
and Lil Yachty have made names 
for themselves by ditching 
lyricism for a more laid-back 
sound. The difference between 
these 
rappers 
and 
Young 
Thug, however, is that Thug 
supplements his lack of lyricism 
with 
artistic 
substance, 
whereas 21 and Yachty leave 
their listeners with a lackluster 
and chordless beat void of any 
creative inspiration. Listen to 
his track “Kanye West” and 
you can hear the difference: 
Thug incorporates a dynamic, 
syncopated beat into a song 
with real chord progressions 
and engaging instrumentation. 
The track is not your typical 
trap rap, and Young Thug is not 
your typical trap rapper.
Thug’s defining quality is 
his voice. No one can mistake 
the blend of pleasantly strained 
falsetto and eerily warbled 

baritone for any other rapper. 
Some love it, some hate it, but 
regardless, it’s unmistakable. 
The sounds he can produce are 
certainly unique, but Thug’s 
real talent lies in what he can 
do with those sounds. The 
Atlanta mumbler has the power 
to make his listeners feel, so 
much so that his 
words 
become 
irrelevant. 
Grantland 
contributor 
Shea 
Serrano 
describes 
this 
ability 
perfectly: “In a 
lot of instances, 
Young Thug isn’t 
making 
music 
that you have to 
unravel in terms 
of meaning. His 
whole 
thing 
is 
how 
do 
I 
feel? 
How 
am 
I connected to 
this verse? He’s just trying to 
generate this feeling, and the 
feeling is the meaning. It’s that 
simple.” Comprehensible lyrics 
or not, Young Thug elicits 
emotion in his music, a feat 
that 21 and Yachty simply can’t 
pull off with their unrefined 
deliveries.
Not only is Young Thug a cut 
above other mumble rappers 
with his high-quality beats and 
captivating melodies, but he is 
also transforming mumble rap 
into a creative and progressive 
genre. Similar to The Beatles’s 
introduction of art to rock ‘n’ 
roll with their inventive and 
all-encompassing 
production 
of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts 
Club Band brought listeners 
a 
creative 
experience 
that 
revealed the artistic potential 
of their genre. Young Thug is 

introducing a new art to the 
world of wordless rap. The 
JEFFERY album cover says it 
all: Posing in a blue and purple 
pastel 
colored, 
Victorian-
era dress, Thug signals to 
his listeners that his music is 
more than a shallow glimpse at 
urban life in Atlanta. Mumble 
rap has become 
an 
artistic 
experience 
that 
aims 
to 
challenge 
rap 
entirely. 
How 
many 
Atlanta 
rappers will you 
find 
sporting 
dresses?
Thug’s 
genre-bending 
is 
especially 
evident 
in 
his 
newest 
album, 
Beautiful 
Thugger 
Girls. 
With the LP’s 
first 
track, 
“Family Don’t Matter,” Thug 
surprises his listeners with 
acoustic guitar and ethereal 
vocals that one might find 
on a Lumineers track. Then, 
a 
classic 
and 
tight 
Thug 
beat 
drops, 
accompanied 
by a melody with country 
undertones 
and 
the 
rare 
decipherable 
line, 
“Country 
Bill made a couple milly.” The 
best part: The song retains 
the “feel good” quality Thug’s 
music is known for.
This eclectic mix of sounds 
and genres is exactly why 
Young Thug is the untouchable 
king of mumble rap. Would Lil 
Yachty be able to pull off such a 
foreign yet incredibly engaging 
sound? I seriously doubt it — 
the man doesn’t even know the 
difference between a clarinet 
and a cello.

Michigan Invitational 
defined by comebacks

Kate Fahey was down, but not 

out.

Despite dropping the first 

set, 4-6, to fifth-ranked Gabriela 
Talaba of Texas Tech on Monday, 
the junior — ranked No. 33 — came 
back to take the second set, 6-3, 
tie the third, 6-6, and eventually 
prevail in the tiebreaker, 7-2.

Fahey wasn’t the only member 

of the Michigan women’s tennis 
team who staged a comeback 
at the Michigan Invitational — 
which ran from Saturday through 
Monday — though. Sophomore 
Chiara Lommer also dropped 
her first set to a higher-ranked 
opponent Monday before taking 
the next two sets to win the match, 
1-6, 6-2, 6-2.

“Today, we lost a lot of first 

sets and they came back,” said 
Michigan coach Ronni Bernstein. 
“That’s gonna be the key to our 
year.”

Fahey’s victory capped off 

a 
weekend 
sweep, 
defeating 

two ranked opponents in three 
matches. After a fall season that 
didn’t live up to her expectations, 
she took the invitational as an 
opportunity to prove herself. 
There, she found success.

“I kinda surprised myself,” 

Fahey said. “I stepped up more 
and I think it paid off in the end.”

Two freshmen, Alyvia Jones 

and Bella Lorenzini, also went 
three-for-three in their singles 
matches. Lorenzini didn’t drop a 
single set during the tournament.

“It’s good to see the young kids 

being the ones stepping up early,” 
Bernstein said. “It definitely gives 
us some depth in the lineup.”

Where the Wolverines didn’t 

fare so well was in the doubles 
competition.

Jones and senior Alex Najarian 

were the most successful pairing, 
taking their set against an Arizona 
State team, 6-0. But against Texas 

Tech, Georgia Tech, Ohio State 
and Arizona State, Michigan won 
just three of 11 doubles matches.

Perhaps that’s the result of 

junior Brienne Minor — the 
reigning NCAA singles champion 
— being unable to play after 
undergoing 
knee 
surgery 
in 

the offseason. With that, the 
Wolverines were forced to try 
out several different pairings. But 
Michigan took it as an opportunity 
to discover whose styles meshed 
well together.

And while doubles will likely 

never be a strength for the 
Wolverines, its collection of talent 
is such that vast improvement 
could come from simply finding 
which pairings work best.

“It’s just a matter of finding who 

we work well with,” Fahey said. 
“There are just some things we 
need to work on a little bit more.”

The tournament served as 

a good litmus test for where 
Michigan stands going into the 
dual meets, which feature a team 
component not present at the 
invitationals.

“(This event) kinda looks like a 

dual match even though it isn’t,” 
Bernstein said. “It’s just gonna get 
us ready for Kansas coming next 
weekend.”

And more than just the wins, 

the comebacks are a positive sign 
for the Wolverines going forward.

“Putting ourselves in those 

situations,” 
Fahey 
said, 
“(I 

force) myself to go for the shots I 
wouldn’t usually go for.”

Facing 
higher-ranked 

opponents after dropping the first 
set, Michigan easily could have 
crumbled. But it didn’t, and that’s 
why Bernstein sees bigger things 
coming for a relatively young 
team.

“We gotta keep working and I 

think we can get better,” Bernstein 
said. “I think the girls leave this 
weekend confident that we can 
compete with anybody in the 
country.”

Without Haughey, ‘M’ 
still finds a way to win

Many things can change in 

the span of three months. Winter 
turns into spring. A school’s Greek 
life can come, go, and return 
again. A team that seems destined 
for success at the beginning of a 
season can spiral into failure.

The No. 4 Michigan women’s 

swim team has spent three 
months on the road, finding 
success during its 
travels. Saturday, 
the 
Wolverines 

brought 
home 

that 
winning 

spirit to Canham 
Natatorium, 
beating 
No. 
10 

Indiana.

Right 
from 

the start of the 
first race, it was 
easy to see why 
many 
players 

on the team felt energized to 
be swimming in Ann Arbor for 
the first time since September. 
Canham Natatorium was packed 
almost to capacity, and every 
Michigan win was accompanied 
by a chorus of Hail to the Victors.

“It’s great energy, and we feed 

off of it,” said Michigan coach 
Mike Bottom. “We had some 
great swimming today… Having 
our band and our supporters here 
made a huge difference.”

Although the Wolverines were 

missing junior Siobhán Haughey, 
a former Olympian, Michigan was 
able to win relatively easily, 180-
120.

“I was so impressed with the 

whole team,” Bottom said. “We 
had one of our best swimmers, 
Siobhán, injured and not able to 
swim. That came up at the last 
minute. We had to make some 
changes due to Siobhán not 
swimming today, but our captains 
led us and the whole team really 
responded to that. They filled in 
where we needed to. Our fight was 
outstanding.”

Without Haughey, Michigan 

faced the tough task of facing 
Indiana’s Lilly King, a two-

time Olympic gold medalist in 
her own right. While King won 
multiple events, performances 
from swimmers like senior Clara 
Smiddy helped offset that. Smiddy 
won two events, including a 
three-second win over King in the 
200-yard IM.

The Wolverines specifically 

dominated the freestyle events, 
taking the top three spots in 
the 50, 100, 500 and the 1000-

yard freestyle. 
Junior 
Rose 

Bi, 
who 
won 

the 
500-yard 

freestyle, 
was 

confident in the 
team’s chances 
to win.

“We’re 

definitely 
a 

really 
strong 

team, 
but 
I 

know that we’re 
one of the best 

teams in the nation,” Bi said. “So 
I was pretty confident that we 
could beat them, even though 
they gave us a lot of challenges. I 
also saw a lot of opportunities to 
improve myself. They have some 
people who are better than us, so 
in the future, I can do better in 
these rounds.”

Just like Bi, Bottom saw the 

match as a golden opportunity 
for improvement, looking ahead 
to the Big Ten Championships 
and NCAAs. Against good teams, 
better ones rise to the occasion.

“They swam very fast against 

us,” Bottom said. “That was their 
fastest dual meet by far, and that 
was on both sides. We rose, and 
that was one of our fastest dual 
meets by far… When you face good 
competition you rise to it, and we 
learned.”

Many lessons can be learned 

from spending so much time on 
the road. The Wolverines found 
that out for themselves over the 
last three months, and Saturday’s 
domination of the Hoosiers was a 
glimpse of that.

Now, only time will tell if those 

lessons will pay off for Michigan 
in the postseason.

No. 8 Michigan taken down by No. 4 Indiana

As soon as he dove in, the 

race was over.

For 
40 
laps, 
senior 
PJ 

Ransford glided up and down 
the pool, toying with the rest 
of the field before touching 
the wall first in the 1,000-yard 
freestyle.

“I 
felt 
really 
strong,” 

Ransford said. “I was hitting 
my stroke count really well and 
it worked out 
really nicely.”

However, 

success did not 
come as easily 
for 
the 
rest 

of 
Ransford’s 

team. 
The 

eighth-ranked 
Wolverines 
(3-1 Big Ten, 
5-1 
overall) 

would win just 
three more events on Saturday 
en route to a disappointing loss 
to No. 4 Indiana (1-0 Big Ten, 
7-0 overall) — the defending 
conference champions — 170.5 
to 129.5.

The 
loss 
marked 
the 

Michigan 
men’s 
swimming 

and diving team’s first defeat 
at 
home 
at 
the 
Canham 

Natatorium since 2008, as they 
won just four events on the day 
to Indiana’s twelve.

In 
the 
sprint 
freestyle 

events, the Wolverines had 
no answer for the Hoosiers’ 
Blake Pieroni, who helped the 
U.S. win gold in the 400-meter 
freestyle relay in Rio. Pieroni 
touched first in the 50, 100 
and 200, downing fellow Rio 
Olympian and sophomore Felix 
Aubock along the way.

Michigan was no match for 

Indiana on the boards as well, 
as the Hoosiers took the top 
four spots in the three-meter 
diving 
event. 
Sophomores 

Jacob Herremans and Stevie 
Anderson finished fifth and 
sixth respectively. In the one-
meter event, Indiana took the 
top two spots.

Still, there were several 

silver-linings 
for 
the 

Wolverines. 
Michigan 

dominated the long-distance 
events. 
After 
Ransford 

cruised to victory in the 
1,000, he added another first 
place finish in the 500-yard 
freestyle. 
Freshman 
Luiz 

Gustavo Borges and Aubock 
followed suit, sealing the 1-2-3 
sweep for the Wolverines, 
respectively.

“As a distance group, we 

knew we had to do really well 

and score a lot of 
points in those 
events,” Ransford 
said. “We scored 
a lot of points in 
both races which 
is all you can ask 
for.”

Additionally, 

senior 
Evan 

White 
was 

involved 
in 
a 

pair of extremely 

close races. In the opening 200-
meter medley relay, White’s 
strong butterfly leg catapulted 
the Wolverines to an apparent 
split-second victory. However 
the Michigan relay team was 
later disqualified.

In the 100-yard butterfly, 

White touched the wall first 

by a fingernail, igniting a roar 
in the crowd at Canham. He 
capped off the day with a pair 
of second-place finishes in the 
200-yard butterfly and 200-
yard individual medley.

“I was trying to race as fast 

as I could and score points for 
Michigan really,” White said.

Added Michigan coach Mike 

Bottom: “Evan’s a senior and 
every senior wants to fight for 
Michigan.”

The 
Wolverines’ 
seniors 

proved Bottom 
right. Several of 
them recorded 
their 
best 

times 
on 
the 

day, 
including 

James 
Peek, 

who split a 43.8 
in the 400-yard 
freestyle relay.

“We’re 

getting towards 
the end of our 
collegiate career,” Ransford 
said. “And you just want to 
fire it up and swim fast for the 
team.”

Though 
the 
outcome 

was 
disappointing, 
Bottom 

continued 
to 
emphasize 

the value of these regular 
season dual meets as learning 

experiences and opportunities 
for growth, especially against 
an elite team like the Hoosiers.

“When 
you 
face 
great 

competition you rise to it,” 
Bottom said. “We rose, they 
rose.”

With just over a month until 

the Big Ten Championships, 
the Wolverines have their work 
cut out for them.

“We just have to do what we 

do,” Bottom said. “We have to 
get better.”

And 
just 

like 
last 
year, 

this 
year’s 

championship 
meet will likely 
come down to 
Michigan 
and 

Indiana 
once 

again. But this 
time, according 
to 
White, 
the 

Wolverines will 
be 
looking 
to 

avenge losses from both last 
year’s 
championships 
and 

Saturday’s dual meet.

“It’s always tough to take 

a loss at home,” said White. 
“But our guys showed strong 
mentalities, and this is just 
going to be fuel for the fire for 
the championship season.”

MATT VAILLIENCOURT/Daily

Senior PJ Ransford was one of few Michigan swimers who performed well in its meet against No. 4 Indiana. 

The Wolverines found out where improvement is needed in loss to the Hoosiers

“As a distance 
group, we knew 

we had to do 
really well.”

“When you 
face great 

competition, 
you rise to it.”

Forwards nominated for Hobey Baker Award

In its entire history, the 

Michigan hockey team has seen 
just two players claim a Hobey 
Baker Award: Kevin Porter in 
2007-08 and Brendan Morrison 
in 1996-97.

And given the Wolverines’ 

(5-7-2 Big Ten, 10-10-2 overall) 
performance 
this 
past 

weekend against 
then-No. 
9 

Minnesota (4-9-
1, 13-12-1), it’s 
no 
surprise 

that 
senior 

forward 
Tony 

Calderone 
and 

junior 
forward 

Cooper Marody 
were nominated 
Monday for the same award that 
solidified Porter and Morrison as 
Michigan hockey legends.

“It’s a tremendous honor,” 

Marody said. “I remember when 
I came in right at my freshman 
year and I walked into this room 
that was a lounge at one time, and 
the Hobey Baker trophies were 
there and above was a picture 
with the two Hobey Baker 

winners – Brendan Morrison 
and Porter – and coach (Red) 
Berenson told me, he said, ‘You 
see those right there? Go get 
one.’ ”

That memory certainly seems 

like more of a reality now.

Marody and Calderone lead 

the team in points with 31 and 
27, respectively, and steered the 
Wolverines to an unexpected 

sweep 
of 
the 

Golden Gophers.

“Obviously, 

you know they’ve 
had good years,” 
said 
Michigan 

coach 
Mel 

Pearson. “ … I’m 
glad they were 
recognized 
for 

it. 
Obviously, 

they can’t do it 
without a lot of 

help from other people, but good 
for them, they both deserve to be 
nominated and recognized for 
the starts they’ve had so far.”

The pair – in conjunction with 

senior forward Dexter Dancs – 
are no strangers to the spotlight 
as almost 40% of Michigan’s 
total points run through them.

But are either of them worthy 

of the highest honor in collegiate 

hockey?

Let’s put it in context of the 

Wolverines’ biggest and most 
successful series of the season 
thus far.

Mariucci Arena – Minnesota’s 

home rink – is one of the most 
hostile environments in all of 
college 
hockey, 
but 
Marody 

managed to give Michigan a 3-1 
lead both Friday and Saturday. 
They 
were 

much-needed 
insurance goals 
to solidify its two 
victories.

Calderone, 

despite 
his 

uncommon goal-
less 
weekend, 

racked up three 
assists, 
one 
of 

which 
was 
to 

Dancs to get the 
Wolverines on the board first 
Friday.

To say that Marody and 

Calderone generated all of the 
Michigan offense this weekend 
would be a farce, as the sweep 
can be attributed to a complete 
revival – a rev of the Wolverines’ 
offensive engine.

“You see one guy working, 

shoveling, and then maybe three 

or four guys just leaning on their 
shovels watching, and I think 
we’ve been a little bit like that,” 
Pearson said. “Lately, all the guys 
are getting their hands dirty.”

Junior 
forward 
Brendan 

Warren 
certainly 
can 
be 

considered one of those guys, 
netting two goals Friday that 
ultimately helped award him the 
Big Ten First Star of the Week.

However, their 

combined 
plus-

minus of three 
is worth noting 
to consider the 
impact of their 
prowess.

At face value, 

Calderone’s 
team-leading 15 
goals 
– 
which 

ties for seventh 
in 
the 
nation 

– and Marody’s 31 points are 
considerable accolades. But, the 
recent success of the pair wasn’t 
always a given in the up-and-
down season the Wolverines are 
having.

They were scoreless against 

Ohio 
State 
in 
Columbus, 

Michigan State in East Lansing 
and Notre Dame in South Bend. 
While the Michigan offense – if 
one were to look at the season 
in its entirety – has been reliant 
on Marody and Calderone, their 
performance has ultimately been 
inconsistent.

“I 
think 
this 
weekend 

might’ve shown that we can do it 
against good teams,” Calderone 
said of the Selection Committee’s 
process. “But they’ve probably 
looked at our whole season and 
I think we’ve done pretty well 
… but last weekend definitely 
helped.”

If the weekend against the 

Golden Gophers tells fans one 
thing, it’s that the Wolverines’ 
play is much better when the pair 
is on its game.

And the question remains, can 

they keep it up?

The 
Hobey 
Baker 
Award 

Selection Committee will be 
watching.

A memorable weekend for the senior guards of Michigan basketball

It was quite the weekend for 

Michigan basketball’s seniors.

But if you’re Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman, you’re blasé 
about it all.

“I wasn’t thinking about 

much, just making the free 
throws,” the senior guard said 
after 
notching 
his 
1,000th 

career point — a game-winning 
free throw to top Maryland on 
Monday. “... Definitely didn’t 
think it was gonna happen like 
that, but I’m glad it did — we got 
the win.”

A minute before with the 

Wolverines up 61-59, Abdur-
Rahkman 
pump-faked 
and 

sent two Maryland defenders 
flying. One dribble to the left, 
a spot-up and a much-needed 
3-pointer ignited a frenzy at 
Crisler Center.

In Saturday’s 82-72 upset 

over then-No. 4 Michigan State, 
Abdur-Rahkman contributed 14 
points for his first win in East 
Lansing, including a tough, 
and-one layup that gave the 
Wolverines a two-possession 
lead 
halfway 
through 
the 

second half.

That same day and nearly 

700 miles away, the women’s 
team was creating magic of its 
own from the charity stripe. 
Freshman guard Deja Church 
hit three free throws to send 
the Wolverines into overtime, 
where they would eventually 
topple Nebraska, 69-64.

A 
stressful 
situation? 
Of 

course. 
But 
it 

was 
one 
they 

wouldn’t 
have 

even 
been 
in 

without shooting 
virtuoso 
Katelynn 
Flaherty. It was 
business as usual 
for 
the 
senior 

guard — 9-for-
17 from the field 
and a game-high 
26 points.

Saturday’s 
road 
contest 

was special beyond a thrilling 
victory, 
though. 
With 
8:03 

remaining 
in 
the 
second 

quarter, Flaherty spotted up 
from the top of the 3-point line 
and scored her 2,443rd career 
point. She had surpassed Glen 

Rice’s record to become the 
stand-alone scoring leader in 
Michigan basketball history, 
man or woman.

“It’s pretty incredible to 

think I could hold the record at 
such a prestigious university,” 
Flaherty told The Summitt. “... I 
think it was all set up perfectly 
for me to be successful.”

Added women’s coach Kim 

Barnes 
Arico: 

“Her 
story 
is 

really 
special. 

Hers is a story 
of hard work and 
of perseverance 
and 
of 
never 

giving up and 
overcoming 
obstacles.”

Flaherty 
is 

unequivocally 
the best player in 

Michigan women’s basketball 
history. The same cannot be 
said for Abdur-Rahkman on 
the men’s side. But the two 
East Coast natives have plenty 
in common. Most significantly, 
perhaps, is that their teams 
would not be where they are 
now — a 15-4 record for the 

women and a 16-4 record for 
the men — without them.

Neither 
particularly 

possesses 
stand-out 

athleticism, a trait that made 
them only a step above being 
a fly on the wall coming out of 
high school. Flaherty makes 
up 
for 
her 
5-foot-7 
frame 

with a work ethic marveled 
by 
her 
teammates 
— 
she 

takes 1,000 extra shots after 
practice. Abdur-Rahkman has 
compensated 
for his skinny 
frame 
with 

his 
trademark 

dribble-drive 
finesse 
at 

the 
hoop 
and 

his 
general 

basketball IQ.

“1,000 points, 

too,” 
said 

junior 
forward 

Moritz Wagner 
about 
Abdur-Rahkman’s 

accomplishments. 
“I’m 
very 

happy for him about that. He is, 
in my opinion, very underrated 
in this league. The way he is 
playing is awesome.”

From a leadership standpoint, 

neither is the most vocal — 

that role has been assumed by 
more animated players like 
Wagner and senior forward 
Jillian Dunston. Instead, they 
lead through composure, and 
let their play do the talking. 
Men’s 
coach 
John 
Beilein 

has even compared Abdur-
Rahkman’s calm to notable 
players in the past like Trey 
Burke and Stu Douglass. And 
the senior’s stone face during 
his fate-clinching free throws 

on 
Monday 

circulated 
the 
internet 

thanks to awe-
struck fans and 
followers.

Abdur-

Rahkman 
and 

Flaherty’s 
quieter 
style, 

in other words, 
could 
be 

described 
as 

humble. When asked about 
their individual performances, 
it is inevitable there will be 
a mention of their respective 
coaches and teammates.

“They have always believed 

in me and found me in great 
positions,” Flaherty said. “I 

don’t know if I could have done 
this anywhere else.”

Added 
Abdur-Rahkman 

about his team’s chemistry: 
“We always say that all we 
need is what we have in this 
room and we don’t listen to the 
outside sources and things like 
that. I think us being so close 
as a group, as a team, helps us 
go into tough environments 
like Michigan State and other 
places on the road.”

Regardless 
of 
the 
help 

from their teammates or the 
hurdles they have overcome to 
be focal points of their team, 
their respective impacts are 
unquestioned.

Both 
players 
are 
having 

their best seasons in terms of 
points, rebounds and assists. 
The women’s team appears 
poised to make its first NCAA 
Tournament since 2013. The 
men’s team looks like it will 
have a much easier path to get 
there than last year.

It was a whirlwind three-

day, three-win stretch that 
revealed a message: this year is 
much different for both teams. 
Flaherty and Abdur-Rahkman 
make that a good thing.

‘M’ opens new facility 
with Wolverine Invite

On 
Saturday, 
international 

collegiate 
athletes, 
Michigan 

alum and Olympians gathered in 
Ann Arbor’s new south campus 
athletic complex to break in the 
new indoor track.

The Wolverines hosted the 

Wolverine Invitational, a non-
scoring meet featuring top talent 
from across the country. The 
meet was a chance for Michigan’s 
track and field programs to test 
the waters on their pristine new 
track. The Wolverines learned 
what it’s like to compete on their 
new home turf.

Despite being a preseason 

event, there were still numerous 
highlights. Both the men’s and 
women’s teams fared impeccably 
well against stiff competition.

For the men’s team, events 

such as the 60-meter, 400-meter 
and 4 x 400m relay unfolded 
favorably as Michigan took the 
top spot in all of these events. 
The Wolverines also managed 
second-place finishes in the 
60-meter hurdles, 800-meter, 
one mile, weight throw and high 
jump.

These 
performances 
were 

driven behind senior Khoury 
Crenshaw 
in 
the 
60-meter 

with a time of 6.80 seconds and 
freshman Jandon Briscoe in the 
400-meter with a time of 47.82 
seconds.

The women’s team faired 

equally 
well, 
notching 
top 

finishes in the 400-meter, 4 x 400 
relay and high jump. Scoring top 
finishes were sophomore Jade 
Harrison in the 400-meter with 
a time of 55.48 seconds, senior 
Claire Kieffer-Wright in the high 
jump clearing 1.73 meters and the 
Michigan A team in the 4 x 400 
relay, clocking a 3:44.91 finish. 
Michigan also secured second-
place positions in the 60-meter, 
one mile and weight throw.

Some 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 

second-place 
accolades 
also 

garnered praise, such as junior 
Matt Plowman, who finished 

the 800-meter behind two-time 
Olympic medalist and Michigan 
alum Nick Willis.

“I think I did good for the first 

meet,” Harris said. “And I think 
the whole team did super well for 
the first meet as well. There were 
a lot of standouts like Jandon 
(Briscoe), he did really well in the 
400, and then (junior) Meghan 
(Marias) got second place in the 
60, then stepped up to be in the 
4 x 4.”

What 
makes 
these 

performances 
even 
more 

exemplary 
is 
that 
every 

individual’s winning mark will 
now serve as the new facility 
record. While some records 
may be broken in subsequent 
meets, others look to last a while. 
Unattached triple jumper Donald 
Scott 
landed 
a 
noteworthy 

17.06-meter jump, a mark that 
would have dethroned the old 
facility record, and professionals 
Nicole Sifuentes and Shannon 
Osika ran the fastest mile times 
ever recorded in the state of 
Michigan at 4:27.69 and 4:28.30, 
respectively.

All in all, one of the largest 

crowds to ever watch a home 
Michigan 
track 
meet 
was 

impressed with not only the 
quality of the competition, but of 
the new facility as well.

“At first it was pretty nerve-

wracking,” Briscoe said. “But 
after my first 60, I felt settled 
in, and honestly — this is one of 
the best tracks I’ve ran on. I’ve 
been all over the country running 
track, and this is probably the 
best track for sprints I’ve ever 
had.”

Added 
Michigan 
women’s 

coach James Henry: “You can 
never have a second chance to 
make a first impression. And 
these kids’ first impression, I 
thought, was very good. There’s 
a reason we put up a world class 
facility — because we wanted to 
bring in world class athletes, and 
we want to get to the point where 
these kids can aspire to be such a 
person.”

“It’s pretty 

incredible to 

think I could 

hold the record.”

“I don’t know if I 

could have done 

this anywhere 

else.”

Wolverines exact revenge against Ohio State

It didn’t make any sense — at 

least, not at first.

With 
under 
two 
minutes 

remaining in the third quarter, 
junior 
shooting 
guard 
Nicole 

Munger dribbled the ball up 
court, running point. Why was she 
suddenly playing the new position? 
It would soon be clear.

While Munger handled the 

ball, the team’s usual point guard 
— senior Katelynn Flaherty — 
managed to sneak around the 
Buckeyes’ defense, and a couple 
passes later she drained a 3-pointer 
from the left wing. This clever play 
created the diversion Flaherty 
needed to snag an open look, and 
the Wolverines grabbed hold of the 
lead, 56-54.

They never let go.
That play was a major tipping 

point, as the No. 19 Michigan 
women’s basketball team (5-2 Big 
Ten, 16-4 conference) upset No. 8 
Ohio State (5-1, 16-3) in Columbus 
on Tuesday night, 84-75.

The first half was a foul frenzy. 

Junior center Hallie Thome — 
Michigan’s go-to player in the 
post — got two fouls within the 
opening quarter. This restrained 
the Wolverines’ abilities down 
low, and the Buckeyes started to 
dominate the paint, led by forward 
Stephanie Mavunga.

Thome didn’t let her foul 

troubles stop her, though, and she 
stepped up big time.

With four fouls in the fourth 

quarter, Thome closely guarded 
Mavunga in the low post with two 
minutes remaining in the game. 
With the score at 78-72, a fifth 
foul would have been troublesome 
for Michigan. But Thome’s smart 
positioning helped her draw a 
charge while Mavunga attempted 
a spin move, further building 
momentum for the Wolverines. She 
also helped Michigan maintain its 
separation in the final period with 
some critical baskets, finishing the 
night with a team-high 27 points.

But Ohio State found foul 

troubles of their own. Its star 
guard, Kelsey Mitchell, picked up 
two fouls early on. That forced 
her to ease up on the defensive 

end, and with Mitchell playing 
conservatively, 
Munger 
took 

advantage — easily finding the lane 
and scoring on Mitchell. Munger 
shined for Michigan from the start 
and wasn’t far behind Thome with 
a career-high 20 points.

“Nicole played with an extreme 

amount of confidence,” Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico told 
WTKA. “She was definitely a 
difference maker.”

Though 
they 
excelled 
in 

transition, the Wolverines were 
initially unable to tame the 
Buckeyes’ multi-threat offense — 
made up of Mitchell and Mavunga, 
who finished with 20 and 21 points, 
respectively. 
Michigan 
trailed, 

25-21, at the end of the first stanza.

On the first play of the second 

frame the Wolverines turned the 
ball over. That became a theme, 
and Ohio State scored 25 points off 
turnovers by the end of the game. 
Five minutes before halftime, 
though, Mitchell got called for her 
third foul and headed to the bench. 
This break helped Michigan stay 
in the game, as it started to cut into 
the deficit. But Flaherty struggled 

to score. She had just three points 
at the break, and the Buckeyes led, 
41-36.

The Wolverines went to work 

in the third quarter, going on a 
7-0 run right off the bat. Flaherty 
started to look more like herself, 
draining a corner 3-pointer to 
ignite the run. A couple minutes 
later, she tied the game up at 41 
with a layup in transition. She 
finished the night with 21 points, 
and her success in the second half 
fueled Michigan.

“We were really scoring the 

basketball,” Barnes Arico said. 
“I think that just helped our 
confidence.”

It was the second contest 

between the two teams in a span 
of 10 days. The Wolverines lost a 
heartbreaking overtime contest in 
Ann Arbor and had their revenge 
planned for Tuesday. Despite a 
tough first half, they succeeded.

“Nine days ago was one of the 

toughest times,” Barnes Arico said. 
“We really felt like we let the game 
slip away, and we really focused on 
improving a lot of the mistakes we 
had made at that point.”

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | JANUARY 17, 2018


P

ast the deer and occasional 
wild turkey on North Campus, 
beyond the research complexes 

and Environmental Protection Agency 
field office, lies a stretch of strip malls 
with grocery stores and gyms with vacant 
parking lots. Along Plymouth Road, among 
stores with yellowing signs and mounds 
of snow taking up parking spaces, there’s a 
place that is always full — the Songbird Cafe.

The first time I came here was a little less 

than a year ago. I came with my roommates 
to escape the back-to-school campus craze 
on a Sunday morning. We sat among 
families on their way back from church, 
graduate students and other groups of 
friends like ourselves.

Today, I’m here to enjoy the atmosphere 

and let the coffee meddle with my thoughts. 
I start with a spicy ginger tea and order a 
dirty chai latte. The Songbird Cafe is one 
of the cafes that has realized good coffee 
needs good food with it. My green tea 
muffin with candied ginger and walnuts 
makes my latte taste even better.

The American eatery serves brunch, 

lunch and baked goods with a full coffee 
bar. The Songbird Cafe is creative, without 
trying too hard — it feels like home, and 
less like an Instagram showroom. Chestnut 

brown tables and chairs are lined along 
the window, comfy couches and stools 
filling the inside. The pale wallpaper 
balances the darkness of the wood. The 
lamps are splattered in a rusty silver that 
lights the artwork and dry flowers on the 
back wall. Natural light floods the other 
half. As it gets darker outside, the lamps 
feel brighter.

Artisan sandwiches and lattes are written 

on a chalkboard up front that makes you 
want to read the entire menu because the 
cursive handwriting is fun to follow with 
your eyes. They have omelets with Gouda, 
bacon, mushrooms and caramelized onions. 
The grilled cheese comes with apple butter 
on Italian bread. The tangerine-lavender 
hot chocolate always catches my eye. Fresh 
muffins, cookies and bundt cakes are lined 
by the cashier. I want to try everything on 
the menu.

The Songbird Cafe turns off Wi-Fi 

on weekends during brunch and lunch 
hours. I like that the cafe isn’t all clatter 
from keyboards and sound leaking from 
headphones, 
but 
conversation. 
When 

conversation stops, there’s music instead. 
They are the only cafe I know of that does 
this in Ann Arbor, and it works. People fill 
the space, the way the smell of coffee and 

baked goods do — they come to enjoy each 
other’s company.

There are families and couples, people 

that come alone with a good book. It feels 
like a cafe, the way it’s always buzzing, 
but mellow at the same time. The workers 
are friendly and I always ask what their 
favorite pastry is before I order. I don’t 
know if it’s a uniform, but I like that they 
dress in earth tone sweaters and lots of 
grays. They seem happy here, unlike the 
baristas I’ve encountered at some other 
coffee shops.

The cafe makes you warm from the 

inside, like it’s Christmas year-round. 
Coming here, sitting in the corner and 
watching families talk, couples play thumb 
games with Louis Armstrong’s “What a 
Wonderful World” playing in the back, 
takes me home with my family.

It’s nostalgic. Maybe it’s just me. Maybe 

it’s because my grandma’s mountain 
house is different shades of brown with 
dried lavender stems in white ceramic 
vases. Maybe it’s because my mom used 
to wash, cut and fry potatoes from scratch 
like Songbird does. Maybe it’s because I 
come from a family that never allowed 
electronics at the dinner table. Maybe it’s 
because my brother is in the hospital on 
the other side of the planet and I can’t do 
anything but sit here and write and drink 
my latte. Seeing siblings trade bites of 
their sandwich, old married couples share 
coffee, people on the phone laughing at 
jokes I can’t hear, makes me miss home. But 
maybe that’s OK too.

Songbird Cafe is a people place. It’s 

special in the way it values its customers 
and gives them space to breathe — it’s 
hard to find places like this. For students 
and faculty on campus, it’s a getaway. It’s 
further from the noise and competition, 
but sure worth the hike. It’s a nook in a 
strip mall I’m happy I found.

There are medical students talking 

about their first rotation, old friends 
reuniting, people talking about the future, 
others journaling. It makes me appreciate 
the company I’m with, the communities 
I’m a part of. It’s calming, the way cafes 
are in movies and books, the way I picture 
them in my head.

Soundtracking: The weather’s mood swings

I

f there’s one thing I’m reasonably 
good at — and the list of things I 
can do is pretty low these days — 

it’s small talk about the weather.

You wanna talk about a movie you 

saw last week? Sure. Wanna ask how my 
day was? Something awkward probably 
happened but I’ll tell you everything 
anyway. Wanna talk about the weather?

Fuck yes.
I love talking about the weather. 

Nothing gets me more jazzed, more 
stoked or more psyched than the weather 
because you can bring it up anytime and 
someone will always have something 
to say. You’ll never cut anyone out. It’s a 
universal issue … Well, it’s not actually 
universal because microbes on other 
planets have different weather patterns to 
talk about, but it’s a saying so hop off your 
soapbox and chill out. It’s just the weather.

Here’s an actual conversation I had 

the other day. Very pleasant, would rate 
it seven out of 10 in terms of personal 
fulfillment.

“Hey.”
“Hey! Man, this weather is wild! Like, 

make up your mind, planet!”

“Yeah for sure. Catch you later.”
Easy 
peasy, 
lemon 
squeezy. 
No 

bullshit, just talking about the weather. 
That’s all you need. Like the other day …

“One Fine Day” — The Chiffons
I had gotten used to piling on layers of 

clothes in the morning assuming it was 
just as freezing as the day before. That’s 
a pretty fair assumption in Ann Arbor. 
Once it starts snowing, you’re pretty 
much a Popsicle until spring. Don’t get 
me wrong, I love snow. But if it’s cold 
and it’s not snowing, there’s no point 
to it being so cold. Just give us some 
snow to awe at and put on Snapchat as 
if everyone else can’t just look out the 
window and see the exact same thing. 
But one day, I popped on jeans, tall 
socks, boots, an undershirt, a flannel, 
a crewneck and then a coat featuring a 
lovely accent of a beanie and gloves. I 
was ready for whatever Earth wanted to 
throw my way …

Except heat. Fifty degrees blindsided 

me like that Sandra Bullock movie 
about football.

The moment I stepped outside, I 

noticed the sun was actually shining 
and a lovely warmth was brushing my 
cheeks. I braced myself for nothing. I ran 
back upstairs and changed, definitely 
securing my tardiness to lecture but who 
cares? It’s summer again!

“Pool Boyz” — Diet Cig
“I just wanna get cool / Let’s go 

swimming in a swimming pool”

I don’t think there was anyone not 

talking about the weather that day. It 
warmed my heart. I walked down State 
Street, eavesdropping because I’m an 

invasive piece of shit, and all I heard 
was people marveling at the weather. No 
one was excluded from the conversation. 
The campus was united over the Earth’s 
mood swings.

We had just come out of what felt 

like an eternal winter. The gray skies 
felt ingrained in my vision but now, I 
looked up and saw nothing but beautiful, 
striking blue. Later that day, the sunset 
turned the sky a lovely shade of pink and 
purple. Pure bliss.

“Pineapple Skies” — Miguel
“There’s pineapple purple skies / 

Promise everything gon’ be alright”

The weather was perfect. I was 

perfectly comfortable with a light jacket 

and Hawaiian shirt with a huge hole on 
the front. Usually, if I want to suffer for 
fashion, that one bit where my bare 
skin hits the cold air freezes into an 
ice cube. Fashion is pain and I will 
never change my self-destructive and 
inconvenient ways.

That day, I was content.
I got home that night, lay down in bed 

and was thrilled to see what tomorrow 
would bring.

Pause on the narrative real quick. 

Weather 
apps 
are 
single-handedly 

dismantling our society’s small talk and 
they should be thrown out the window 
as a crime against our social system. 

Hot take, I know, but it’s the truth. If 
you know what the weather is going to 
be like tomorrow, there’s no mystery in a 
conversation. There’s no end result. You 
just know immediately. If I ask someone 
“What do you think the weather’s gonna 
be like?” and I see them reach into their 
pocket to check, I know my entire small 
talk conversation is ruined. Where has 
the joy gone in just guessing and waiting 
to see if your gamble on Earth’s weather 
patterns for the day is correct?

We could never have a casino of 

just predicting what the weather is. 
Technology has ruined that viable 
market and I will never forgive it.

Back to the weather, I woke up the 

next day ready to see if our warm streak 
was about to officially begin.

Think again.
“Cold Cold Heart” — Norah Jones
I was not prepared to jump back to 

where we were two days ago. The Earth 
had given me a taste of what could be and 
I got greedy. Icarus had flown too close 
to the Sun and was cast into the cold 
water below. Honestly, it was just a little 
rude on the Earth’s part. Who do you 
think you are?

I stuck my hand out the window, 

expecting a pleasant brush of heat but 
instead was smacked across the face 
with a cold breeze. I guess I should have 

expected it. In the wise words of that 
one Robert Frost poem that people only 
know from “The Outsiders”: “nothing 
gold can stay.”

I threw on my Target-brand navy-

blue peacoat that I’ve had since 
freshman year of high school. It has 
failed me many times but I was hopeful 
that I could conserve body heat on my 
way to class.

Fuck hope.
“Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad” 

— Prince

You betrayed me, peacoat and I will 

never forgive you … until I ultimately 
forget and don you another day.

I went about my day, freezing in my coat 

but it takes a lot to be a fashion icon like 
myself. I was taking the Commuter South 
bus route from North Campus, trying to 
concentrate on the music blaring from 
my earbuds. If I focused on the warming 
sounds of Prince’s silky smooth voice, I 
wouldn’t be as cold. It had worked in the 
past. Unfortunately, I focused a little too 
hard and missed my stop by a mile and a 
half. I immediately pulled the yellow cord 
and jumped off the bus at the nearest 
stop. There was no way I was about to 
walk home from where I ended up. So I 
waited … and waited … and then I thought 
about how cold I was … and then I waited 
some more.

“All Day” — Kanye West
I looked like Jack Nicholson in the 

end of “The Shining” by the time the 
Commuter North bus rolled around to 
take me back the way I came. The door 
popped open and I swear I had to break 
the ice that had formed around my 
joints before I could walk like a robot 
into that warm haven. I never thought 
I would have treated the sopping and 
muddy insides of a blue bus with the 
same appreciation and folksiness that 
I would a beautiful cabin in the woods 
with a roaring fireplace. I kicked my feet 
up, kept my earbuds OUT of my sight 
so I wouldn’t get distracted again and 
watched with the glaring intensity of a 
night owl for my stop.

I ran to my room, jumped in bed 

and lied there until I could feel my 
appendages again.

“Warm on a Cold Night” — Homme 

ft. Aminé

Despite 
this 
pain, 
despite 
the 

unfortunate 
scenarios 
Earth’s 

seemingly random weather patterns 
may bring, they keep you on your toes.

Also, I wouldn’t have this week’s 

column without small talk about the 
weather.

So thanks for helping me reach 

word count, Earth. You’re pretty rad 
sometimes. Keep on doin’ you.

“Thank You” — Francis and the 

Lights

In Search of a Home

by Abigail Muro, Daily Staff Reporter

I 
 

get homesick when I look at 
pictures of the Sonoran desert. 
The gray-green Saguaro cacti, 
reaching their limbs past the 

distant, jagged mountain peaks toward 
a radiant blue sky, feel like family. Home 
is a white and gray tent, small enough 
to look natural among the desert brush 
and stones.

I was born in Tucson, Arizona, but 

by the time I was old enough to know 
what a home was, I had already moved 
to Washington, D.C., where I grew up. 
So proud was I of the camping I’d done 
as a toddler that I used to tell my ele-
mentary school friends I was born in a 
tent so close to the Mexican border that 
my parents never knew for sure which 
country I was actually born in.

When I was five or six, my father 

taught me, while reading me a book 
about the desert, that the only place in 
the world Saguaro cacti grow is Arizo-
na, California and Mexico. I thought, for 
a long time, that meant the cacti grew in 
clusters, that they stopped at the border 
and restarted a few miles away. I fig-
ured that Arizona’s border was sealed 
off, like a hockey arena; that on one side 
of the plexiglass was Arizona and all its 
wonders and on the other was the rest of 

the world. Needless to say, I was wrong. 
The place where Saguaro cacti grow 
is really just one big area, similar in 
shape to Florida. The main concentra-
tion of cacti is divided up pretty evenly 
between Arizona and Mexico so that if 
one were to walk through the Sonoran 
desert and let their mind wander, they 
might accidentally walk from the Unit-
ed States to Mexico.

The first time my family went back 

to visit Arizona after the big move 
was when I was in second grade. We 
stayed a few days with friends in Tuc-
son and then headed to Organ Pipe Cac-
tus National Monument for a few days 
of hiking and camping under the huge 
desert sky. The monument is a compel-
ling spot: It’s nestled right up against 
the Mexican border, in some of the most 
rugged desert in the United States. It 
glows orange in the morning and a deep 
magenta in the evening as the sun rises 
and sets, reflecting off the grays and 
browns and greens of the landscape.

We went in the spring, the best time 

of year to camp in Arizona, and pitched 
a tent amid a blanket of orangey wild-
flowers that dotted the desert floor. 
After our first night under the stars, 
my dad woke up early to take one of his 

usual long, desert walks. This particu-
lar morning, my older sister Olivia and I 
decided to tag along too. I padded care-
lessly across the desert sand, my lime 
green sneakers crunching against the 
gravelly desert floor. It was a perfect 
Arizona morning, exactly like how I’d 
“remembered” based on the stories and 
pictures in my head from family lore and 
memories. The jagged mountains looked 
like they had been etched into the sky 
and the air felt so clean and clear, it was 
like a sip of water.

Much to my delight, my dad let us 

wander slightly off the path until we 
discovered a small ravine that had been 
eroded out of the rock and dust by water 
some hundreds of years before. Ever the 
explorers, Olivia and I were intrigued. 
Attracted to the terrain and intriguing 
depression we climbed carefully down 
it, examining the rough boulders and 
rock faces as we went. Olivia took the 
lead and I followed, my dad helping me 
find firm footing amid the grit.

“Hey! Someone littered here!” Oliv-

ia suddenly called out, once she had 
reached the bottom. My dad and I 
looked up to find her squatting close 
to the ground, prodding at what looked 
like a candy wrapper. My dad looked 

surprised. Most of the people that 
camped in a location this hard to find 
loved and respected the Earth enough 
to bring their trash with them when 
they left. So when Dad and I reached the 
bottom too, we went over to investigate. 
It seemed that whoever had been there 
had used the ravine as their personal 
trash can. There were several pieces of 
paper and some empty plastic bottles of 
orange juice thrown haphazardly onto 
the ground under a Palo Verde tree.

“It’s in another language,” Olivia 

reported, with a piece of paper with 
funny looking words on it in her hands.

My dad peered at it curiously, before 

deducing the language was Spanish. 
“It’s likely that this trash was left here 
by Mexican immigrants that were prob-
ably walking across the border from 
Mexico,” he said.

“Why don’t they take a plane, or 

drive?” my nine year-old sister asked, 
not missing a beat.

“Well, these people aren’t allowed 

to come into our country because they 
haven’t gotten permission,” my dad 
explained, not mincing his words. “But 
they probably can’t find a job in Mex-
ico. A lot of the people that come here 
illegally would rather stay at home with 
their families, but need some way to 
make money and they can’t do that in 
Mexico, so they come here.”

“So it’s not allowed?” Olivia probed.
“No, it’s not.”
“Is it against the law?”
“It is.”
“So the trash was left by bad guys?”
My dad paused a second. Olivia and 

I stared at him, and then at the pile of 
trash at our feet, in wonder. “Well, it’s 
complicated,” my dad said.

Many parents would have left the 

conversation here, leaving the dis-
cussion about illegal immigrants for 
another day, but my dad went on, “Yes, 
it is technically illegal for them to come 
into the U.S. this way, but they are not 
bad people. They want a better life in 
America, for themselves and for their 
families, just like so many people that 
are already here do. So you can under-
stand why they walk. They are not 
doing anything bad or hurting anyone.”

That was enough of an explanation 

for Olivia and she seemed to be out of 
questions, but she, like I, seemed to 
be having trouble wrapping her mind 

around how much it must take to leave 
one’s home and family. This is some-
thing that I now, years of experience 
and education later, realize I will never 
be able to understand. I had listened to 
the whole conversation, wide-eyed and 
now couldn’t stop myself from gawking 
at what the immigrants had left behind. 
Whose hands had touched those pieces 
of paper? Whose mouths had sipped the 
last bit of orange juice out of the plastic 
bottles?

For the first time, I was able to see 

the desert around me as a barrier or a 
challenge, rather than just as a vaca-
tion sanctuary. I thought about how hot 
the desert gets during the day, about 
the rattlesnakes and scorpions that 
scared me so much I had to have my 
mom shake out my shoes for me in the 
morning. I wondered if the immigrants 
had a tent, and pictured them sleeping 
out in the open, at the mercy of the dry 
lightning strikes and howling coyotes. I 
wondered what could possibly be so bad 
about their home to make them want to 
leave everything and everyone to come 
to the United States. Where were their 
families? How far had they walked? 
Didn’t their feet hurt?

We 
continued 
puttering 
around 

among the cacti and scrubby trees, but 
these new thoughts stuck in my head. 
When we got back to the campsite, my 
sister and I tripped over our sentences, 
each wanting to be the one to explain to 
our mom what we had seen and what we 
had learned. There was excitement in 
our voices and wonderment in our eyes, 
but in the back of my throat, there was 
a tightening of concern for these people 
and the loved ones they’d left behind. 
I never forgot that scene in the arroyo 
and those candy wrappers — evidence 
of other lives doing the best they could.

A couple mornings later it was time to 

head home. With the sun getting warm 
again, we packed up camp and my sister 
and I climbed back up into the rental 
car to head back to civilization.

I was half asleep against the window 

when my sister squawked, “LOOK!” My 
eyes flew open and I craned my neck out 
the window to see a big army-green tint-
ed bus along the side of the road. Sitting 
in the dirt next to it was a group of men, 
with brown, dark hair and dirty clothes. 
My parents exchanged a look.

“What are those people doing there?” 

Olivia asked.

“Remember that trash we saw in the 

desert?” my dad said gently. My sister 
and I nodded, wordlessly. “It’s possible 
that the men who left it there are the 
same ones sitting right there. If it’s not 
those same people, it is probably people 
like them, who have also crossed the bor-
der to try to make money to send back to 
their families. It seems like they are get-
ting picked up by Border Patrol and they 
will likely be sent back to Mexico.”

My sister and I sat in silence, twist-

ing ourselves around to stare out the 
back window until the men and the bus 
faded into the distance. I still remem-
ber some of their faces. They looked 
tired like they hadn’t slept in days and 
maybe hadn’t slept well in years. None 
of them seemed particularly surprised. 
Rather, they looked blank. It was like 
what they had been running from had 
finally, inevitably caught up to them. 
It was very apparent to me: They were 
simply waiting.

For the first time, I saw the faces 

attached to the statistics. I had seen 
the evidence of their journey, had even 
tried to imagine what it might be like to 
walk all day under the blistering sun. I 
had caught a glimpse of the end of the 
first leg of their journey. I imagined 
them being picked up like pawns on a 
chessboard and placed back in Mexico, 
right back at the starting line. I won-
dered if they’d try again and if they did, 
if they’d be caught once more and stuck 
in an endless cycle. And while I’d seen 

enough to think of the immigrants as 
human, I knew that I’d only seen snap-
shots, that I didn’t know the full extent 
of their suffering and didn’t know any 
other pieces of their lives. I wondered 
if I would do the same thing if I hadn’t 
been born in this country, if I’d walk the 
world for myself and the people I love, 
even if it was breaking the laws, to find 
a place I could call home.

My parents have always taught me that 

laws are to be followed. Even today as I 
near my twenties, I am still told to only 
cross at crosswalks, to stop at all stop 
signs and red lights and to read every 
legal document completely and follow it 
to a T. So it took me a long time to figure 
out how my parents could excuse these 
people for breaking the law.

The pursuit of comfort, happiness 

and safety for one’s family is a univer-
sal pursuit. Before there were countries 
and states, there were just territories, 
and before that, there was just land. 
And while of course, it’s not as simple 
anymore as letting people come and go 
between countries as they please, this 
idea, of one Earth, home to anyone and 
anything grown from it, is one that in 
some cases comes before politics and 
legislation. For me, this was a beginning 
to an understanding that not everything 
is black and white. There is a vast and 
complicated gray area involved with 
almost every issue.

My dad had told me, back at the 

ravine in Organ Pipe National Monu-
ment that the immigrants were not bad 
people, but he didn’t have to. I saw it 
on their faces as we drove by. I didn’t 
see, the way some people seem to see 
malice, greed or laziness. All I saw 
were humans, walking from one side of 
the Sonoran desert to the other, in the 
search of a home.

Copy That: Stylizing my hometown

M

y flight ticket didn’t show 
the boarding gate, and 
“St. Louis” didn’t appear 

anywhere on the blue departure 
screens. I was panicking, but I didn’t 
want anyone to know I was panicking. 
This was my first solo flight, and I was 
determined to solve this on my own. 
So I stood in front of the departure 
screens until I felt security shooting 
me weird looks, and then I picked 
up my bag and started confidently 
walking in a random direction.

I must have walked the entire 

length of the airport three times until 
it finally occurred to me St. Louis 
could also be spelled Saint Louis. 
Instead of looking for flights starting 
with “S-T,” I should’ve been looking 
for flights starting with “S-A.”

Standardization is everything at 

copy desk. It’s necessary in order 
to 
avoid 
confusion 
and 
promote 

uniformity. But to be consistent, you 
have to have great attention to detail 
and to know the correct way to stylize. 
The “Saint” in St. Louis, for example, 
should 
always 
be 
abbreviated, 

and seeing my hometown spelled 
out Saint Louis makes me weirdly 
uncomfortable. 

But I’ve learned not only at the 

airport, 
but 
almost 
everywhere 

I’ve traveled, that facts about my 
hometown aren’t as widely recognized 
as I’ve assumed. It’s always interesting 
to hear outside opinions of your city, 
or perhaps a lack of opinion because 
many people don’t know where St. 
Louis is. However, in the copy desk 
spirit of consistency, I’m here to clean 
up these misunderstandings.

First, St. Louis is pronounced 

“Lewis,” not “Louie.” Since it was 
named after King Louis IX of France, 
it may be more accurate to use 
the French articulation “Louie” — 
however, Dr. Seuss is also technically 
supposed to be pronounced “Soice,” 
but I don’t think any of us are going to 
change how we say that anytime soon.

Second, St. Louis is in the Midwest. 

It is not part of the South, to the 
surprise of many. It’s also not in the 
West, though it’s called the “Gateway 
to the West.” It’s Midwest in the 
extreme.

Much of St. Louis is actually in St. 

Louis County, but the county is more 
rural than urban. My neighborhood 
is surrounded by farmland. The bus 
ride to middle school involved passing 

horse pastures and misty cornfields, 
which 
my 
friend 
and 
I 
always 

speculated would be the best place 
for a horror movie scene: a murderer 
appearing from the fog, framed 
between the fence and dilapidated 
barn. You drive a little farther and 
you reach miles and miles of open 
space, huge fields of wheat stubble 
and hay bales.

Finally, St. Louis is fighting, but 

it has not capitulated. Often, when 
people hear I’m from St. Louis, they 

ask me about the Ferguson protests 
and Michael Brown, an unarmed 
Black man who was shot by a white 
police officer in 2014. The rage is still 
very palpable in my city as protests 
continue to turn violent and questions 
continue to remain unanswered. This 
is something that weighs heavily 
on my soul because these national 
discussions 
have 
happened 
right 

in my backyard. Yet, it appears 
these discussions may be having a 
positive effect. The city has elected 

a new mayor. A newly formed citizen 
advisory committee helped select the 
city’s current chief of police. This may 
be a turning point my city needs, and 
an example my country can look to for 
a more just future.

As copy chief this semester, I’ve 

done my fair share of correcting small 
mistakes. Accuracy is important, even 
for airport staff. The problems within 
my city are deep and evident, but I’d 
like to think under closer inspection, 
one can notice change is occurring.

M

y 
grandfather 
on 
my 

mom’s side of the family 
has a lexicon of cliches — 

a signature catchphrase, if you will, 
for almost any situation. “Put an egg 
in your shoe and beat it” happens to 
be my favorite, but there’s also one 
that I’ve only recently gained an 
appreciation for:

“Call me anything you want. Just 

don’t call me late for dinner.”

Over the past three and 

a half years, I’ve become 
immune 
to 
the 
improper 

pronunciation of my name. 
You heard that right.

Last year, a friend of mine 

sat waiting for me to finish an 
editing shift at The Daily. As 
a (former) editor, it was not 
uncommon to hear my name 
from across the newsroom 
multiple 
times 
per 
hour 

during production. As we 
were leaving The Daily that 
night, my friend said she heard 
multiple pronunciations of my 
name in just a few hours, and I 
responded to all of them.

*****

“It’s LAA-ruh, like with the 

‘A’ in ‘cat’ or ‘happy’ or the 
first one in ‘salad.’”

“Am I saying it right?” they 

respond, releasing a sound that 
matches the “A” in “Claire,” or 
“hair,” rather than the hard, 
pungent vowel of my name.

“No, but it’s okay.”
Then I brace myself for 

one of three inevitable looks: 
embarrassment, frustration or 
confusion. I tell them it’s okay, 
that I don’t care what they call 
me, as long as it sounds somewhat close 
to “Lara” and isn’t “Laura” we can still 
be friends. This — usually — is to no avail.

I’m then thrown into uncomfortable 

rounds of mispronunciation: slower, 
louder, higher, then back to slower 
again. They wait for a nod of approval 
that probably won’t come. I can’t tell 
you the number of times I’ve listened 
to: “Lair-uh? Laiir-uh? Laaaiir-uh?” 
as I contemplate becoming one of 
those people who just goes by their 
middle name. Kate Moehlman has a 
nice ring to it, anyway.

But I would never do that. It’s 

Jewish tradition to name a child after 
a deceased family member, and mine 
comes from combining the first two 
letters of the names of my great uncle 
Larry and great-grandmother Rachel 
— people who mean a lot to my parents 
and who, by extension, mean a lot to me. 

For some context, I’m from a 

northern New Jersey suburb of New 
York. The classic “New Jersey Accent” 
isn’t that strong in my hometown 
(people say “wah-ter,” not “woo-
der”), but I also grew up around many 
Brooklyn accents. My mother says 
“Flah-rida” instead of Florida, my 
grandfather regularly drops his “Rs,” 
and when my grandmother was alive, 
she would say President Obama’s last 

name as if the last four letters were 
pronounced the same as those in 
Alabama. Aunts, uncles, cousins and 
close friends in New York and New 
Jersey all said my name the way I 
do. That’s not to say teachers or new 
friends didn’t mess up on the first try. 
They did, but I usually remember it 
sticking with time. 

It wasn’t until my freshman year of 

college, the first significant amount 
of time I’d spent away from the East 
Coast bubble of north Jersey, that I 
felt as though I was defending my own 
pronunciation on a weekly, if not daily, 
basis. Freshman year I was constantly 
meeting new people and introducing 
myself, my intended major, my dorm 
and where I came from. And with that 
came a lot of phonetic explanation.

There 
were 
those 
awkward 

moments that still happen today — in 

which I go in for the handshake or 
the wave or whatever is appropriate 
at the time but, simultaneously, 
try to quell a small tug-of-war that 
wages in my mind. One side tells me 
to say my name the right way, even 
though it will cause confusion and 
an unwanted explanation. The other 
tells me to fake a Midwestern accent 
for the sake of convenience. Just say 
Lair-uh.

But it feels too strange. Sometimes 

I’ll introduce myself as “Lair-uh,” but 
the sound coming out of my mouth 
sounds 10 times weirder than, say, 
speaking in the third person. In fact, it 
feels like speaking in the third person, 
incorrectly. 
My 
self-consciousness 

gets to me.

I would be lying if I said I didn’t know 

this would be an issue before coming to 
Michigan. My dad is from metropolitan 
Detroit and his parents are native 
Detroiters. I remember from a young 
age thinking my dad’s family says my 
name with a strange pronunciation. 
They say, “pop” instead of “soda” (my 
dad has since self-corrected), and they 
say “in line” instead of “on line” when 
they’re waiting to check out at the 
grocery store. (I’m embarrassed to say 
I’m not sure what my dad says off the 
top of my head.)

But my dad’s slightly modified 

pronunciation of my name is a touchy 
subject.

“If your dad helped name you, 

doesn’t that mean the Midwestern 
pronunciation is also right?” is a 
common question I field.

And to that I respond: My dad’s 

Midwestern accent is strange. He says 
my name the way you would imagine 
a Midwesterner living in north Jersey 

for the past 30 years might say 
it — entirely unique. I know it 
sounds different than the way 
my mom or my brother or my 
grandfather say it, but it will 
never be “wrong” to me, no 
matter how much I tease him 
for it. And while it’s obviously 
not “incorrect,” it’s also not 
the pronunciation that I use, 
so I won’t. 

I realize I’m not the only 

person with a name that is 
difficult to pronounce. I’m 
not the only person who 
corrects the professor’s brutal 
pronunciation on the first 
day (re: Laura), even if it’s 
hopeless. But while it feels 
important to correct someone 
at first, I don’t make it a habit. 
I won’t make people feel bad 
after the first slip-up unless 
they ask me to. 

Different 
people 
have 

different, subtle variations, 
and I’m fine with that. If 
anything, it’s a subtle yet 
special reminder of where 
I am. When I’m home from 
school in New Jersey, the 
pronunciation I use and the 
one I grew up with sounds 

sweet 
and 
comforting 
coming 

from 
family 
members 
and 
high 

school friends. When I’m away, the 
Midwestern accent and its many 
different forms remind me that I’m 
in a different space with people from 
unique backgrounds.

To be quite honest, I love my 

name, it’s subtle uniqueness and 
the 
occasional 
“Doctor 
Zhivago” 

reference it brings my way.

And when people call attention to 

it, in those uncomfortable moments 
— when they expect me to become 
frustrated, 
or 
instead 
become 

frustrated with themselves for not 
landing my strong East Coast accent, 
I like to keep my grandfather’s iconic 
catchphrase in the back of my mind:

“Call me anything you want. Just 

don’t call me late for dinner.”

Or Laura.
