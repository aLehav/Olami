At the first official Board of Regents meeting of the semester, plans to renovate two residence halls were approved.
Regents OK renovations


Also confirm
Pollack as next
University provost
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
During its first public meet-
ing since December, the Univer-
sity's Board of Regents convened
Thursday to approve an array of
construction projects, includ-
ing large-scale renovation plans
for two University residence
halls, as well as to approve the
appointment of Martha Pollack,
the University's vice provost for
budgetary affairs, as the Univer-
sity's next provost.

Last month, the regents
assembled in California to meet
with higher-education leaders
and donors in lieu of an official
January meeting. As a result,
Thursday marked the first offi-
cial appearance of Regents Mark
Bernstein (D-Ann Arbor) and
Shauna Ryder Diggs (D-Grosse
Pointe) since assuming their
positions in January.
REGENTS APPROVE
SOUTH QUAD DESIGN
As the next step in plans to
renovate South Quad, the board
approved designs for the $60
million project that was passed
at its meeting last September.
The project will create a

Central Campus dining center,
similar to that of the Hill Dining
Center that services multiple
residence halls. Additionally,
the updates would add improve-
ments to bathrooms, lounges,
study rooms and music practice
spaces. The renovations will
mostly focus on the ground floor
and first floor, covering in total
106,700 square feet of space.
Individual dormitories will not
be altered.
"Thisisacrucialcontinuationof
the residential life initiative phase
two," Timothy Slottow,the Univer-
sity's executive vice president and
chieffinancialofficer said.
Chris Purdy, a project man-
ager for the SmithGroupJJR
architecture and engineering

firm, presented the schematic
design to the board, mention-
ing that students were involved
with its design.
"The planning process for
this project thus far starting
early last year involved exten-
sive involvement from the stu-
dents," Purdy said. "A number of
focus groups were held to really
gain the students' perspective
on the project and what they
would really like to see."
Slated for completion in
the summer of 2014, the bulk
of the plan's cost goes toward
structural improvements such
as plumbing, heating and a fire
detection system.

Campaign aims to
increase dialogue on
campus sexual assault
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
Daily News Editor
LSA senior Josh Buoy knows talking
about sexual assault isn't easy. In fact,
it wasn't until last week that he even
spoke about it publicly. But that isn't
stopping him from spurring a campus-
wide conversation about sexual assault
and what the University can do differ-
ently to address the issue.
Buoy and LSA senior Yonah Lieber-
man facilitated a conversation among
15 students on Thursday night at
Amer's Deli on Church Street, to
address issues they perceive with the
crime alert system used by the Uni-
versity of Michigan Police Department
and the broader implications of sexual
assault on campus.
Buoy and Lieberman (who was a
Daily columnist) are two of four co-
founders of the "I Will" Campaign,
which organized the event. The cam-
paign looks to increase awareness of
sexual assault on campus.
Part of the campaign involves hosting
coffeehouse conversations on a weekly
basis to discuss issues related to sexual
assault in an informal setting. The theme
of this week's conversation was sparked.
by an opinion piece Daily columnist Katie
Steen wrote in which she criticized the
University's crime alertsystem.
Recent criticisms of the crime alert
system have ranged from a perceived
"racialization" of the crime alert per-
petrator description, to the time delay

between when a crime occurs and
when an alert is sent out to students.
Buoy said issues with the language
and descriptions included in crime
alerts might stem from the way in
which UMPD releases them. He said
that if the police focused more on stu-
dents and less on legal procedure, the
alerts would be more effective.
"Obviously they care about our safety
but when they actually send it out, it's
a legal obligation they have to make stu-
dents aware of that incident," Buoy said. "I
think thatifthosetwogoalskindofmerged
together more,that could help alot"
LSA senior Alex Olkowski, co-
coordinator of the Sexual Assault and
Prevention Awareness Center's Men's
Activism committee, said UMPD and
SAPAC have been working together to
improve crime alerts, particularly con-
cerning usage of language that could
be perceived as victim blaming.
Though the purpose of Thursday's
meeting was to start a dialogue rather
than institute any structured change,
Buoy encouraged attendees to develop
a clear idea of exactly what they found
problematic with the crime alerts. The
next step would then be to contact
University Police Spokeswoman Diane
Brown and work with UMPD to rectify
the group's criticisms.
Brown said UMPD would like to
include more information in the crime
alerts, but that is often not feasible. She
said information is often "shaky" and
that the police department is careful
not to send out any false information.
"We'd love to have more detail
about an incident ... about a suspect's
description," Brown said. "If there's
the perception that the police are

LSA freshman
tech blogger takes

Daily StaffReporter
LSA freshman Mark Gurman
works a full-time job, is frequently
quoted in The Wall Street Jour-
nal, and regularly beats his major
competitors in releasing exclusive
coverage about Apple products and
announcements.
Nightslastinguntil3 or 4 a.m.have
become the norm during the three
years that Gurman has reported for
technology site 9to5Mac, which spe-
cializes in all things Apple.
"Apple is a major company, so they
have a huge following as far as what's
next in their product line," Gurman
said. "People are definitely really
interested as to what'sgoingon with-
in the company and the entire eco-

system, so it's our job to tell them."
The site gets 10 to 15 million page
views a month, a number he attri-
butes to people's desire to constant-
ly know what the technology giant
"has nextup its sleeve."
Gurman said the job was a natu-
ral progression for him because of
his love of Apple products and his
interest in journalism.
"I met the owner of the site,
Seth Weintraub, after I found a
domain name before the iPad was
announced that seemed to allude
to Apple buildinga tablet," Gurman
said. "That was big news andI wrote
the story after I discovered that, and
the rest was basically history."
Gurman also broke the news
about the new 128-gigabyte-capac-
ity, fourth-generation iPad last
month, three days before Apple
announced the update.
"I was able to break that news,

German hospitals allow
contraceptives in rape cases

a

Hospitals still can't
perscribe drugs
that lead to death of
embryo
BERLIN (AP) - Roman Cath-
olic-run hospitals can prescribe
limited emergency contracep-
tion to rape victims, German
bishops said Thursday as they
sought to contain fallout from
an embarrassing recent case in
which two hospitals refused to
treat a woman.
In a statement issued at the
end of a regular meeting in the
western city of Trier, the Ger-
man Bishops Conference said
Catholic hospitals still can't
provide drugs that would lead
to the death of an embryo.
The German church was
under pressure to clarify its
stance after two Catholic hos-
pitals in Cologne turned away a
rape victim because of concerns

over the pill. Cologne's arch-
bishop, Cardinal Joachim Meis-
ner, said last month that the
church was "deeply ashamed
by this incident because it goes
against our Christian mission."
At the end of January, Meis-
ner said it was "justifiable" in
such cases to provide drugs that
prevent conception. He later
said he had consulted with Pope
Benedict XVI's secretary, Georg
Gaenswein, and was told that
"everything is alright."
For decades, Catholic hos-
pitals have in cases of rape
allowed the use of spermicidal
wash to impede sperm from
reaching an egg and drugs to
prevent the victim from ovulat-
ing. The rationale is that rape
is an act of violence against a
woman; to prevent the attack
from continuing, a hospital can
use drugs to impede conception.
Church teaching, however,
holds that life begins at concep-
tion, and thus forbids the use
of drugs that would intercept,

H,-,,

dislodge or abort a fertilized
egg, according to the Rev. Rob-
ert Gahl, a moral theologian at
Rome's Pontifical Holy Cross
University.
"This new determination by
the German bishops is in full
continuity with church teach-
ing, and specifies how best to
implement new pharmaceutical
technology," Gahl said.
Thursday's statement by
the bishops stressed that rape
victims "can of course receive
human, medical, psychological
and pastoral help in Catholic
hospitals.
"That can include prescrip-
tion of the 'morning-after pill,'
insofar as it has a preventive and
not an abortive effect. Medical
and pharmaceutical methods
which result in the death of an
embryo still may not be used."
It said the bishops "trust that
practical treatment in Catholic-
run facilities will take place on
the basis of these moral and
theological guidelines."

Bombing ranks as
worst in the country
in more than a year,
hospitalizes 75
HYDERABAD, India (AP)
- A pair of bombs exploded in
a crowded shopping area in the
southern Indian city of Hyder-
abad, killing at least 13 people
and wounding scores of oth-
ers in the worst bombing in the
country in more than a year.
The blasts occurred about
two minutes apart at around 7
p.m. Thursday outside a movie
theater and a bus station, police
said. Storefronts were shat-
tered, motorcycles were covered
in debris, and food and plates
from a roadside restaurant were
scattered on the ground near a
tangle of dead bodies. Passersby
rushed the wounded out of the
area.
"This is a dastardly attack,
the guilty will not go unpun-
ished," Prime Minister Manmo-
han Singh said. He appealed to
the public to remain calm.
The bombs were attached to
two bicycles about 150 meters

(500 feet) apart in Dilsukh
Nagar district, Home Minis-
ter Sushilkumar Shinde told
reporters in New Delhi. The
district is a usually crowded
shopping area near a residential
neighborhood.
When asked if the govern-
ment had any suspects, Shinde
responded: "We have to inves-
tigate."
India has been in a state of
alert since Mohammed Afzal
Guru, a Kashmiri, was hanged
in a New Delhi jail nearly two
weeks ago. Guru had been con-
victed of involvement in a 2001
attack on India's Parliament
that killed 14 people, including
five gunmen.
Many in Indian-ruled Kash-
mir believe Guru dia not receive
a fair trial, and the secrecy with
which the execution was car-
ried out fueled anger in a region
where anti-India sentiment
runs deep.
Andhra Pradesh state Home
Minister P. Sabita Reddy said 11
people died on the spot in the
two blasts and another two suc-
cumbed to their injuries in hos-
pital on Thursday night.
She said another 78 people
were injured and hospitalized

in the city.
Top state police officer V.
Dinesh Reddy said improvised
explosive devices with nitro-
gen compound were used in the
blasts.
Mahesh Kumar, a 21-year-
old student, was heading home
from a tutoring class when a
bomb went off.
"I heard a huge sound and
something hit me, I fell down,
and somebody brought me to
the hospital," said Kumar, who
suffered shrapnel wounds.
Hyderabad, a city of 10 mil-
lion in the state of Andhra
Pradesh, is a hub of India's
information technology indus-
try and has a mixed population
of Muslims and Hindus.
"This (attack) is to disturb
the peaceful living of all com-
munities in Andhra Pradesh,"
said Kiran Kumar Reddy, the
state's chief minister.
The explosions were the first
major bomb attack to hit India
since a September 2011 blast
outside the High Court in New
Delhi killed 13 people. The gov-
ernment has been heavily criti-
cized for its failure to arrest the
masterminds behind previous
bombings.

FUNDING
From Page 1
do that."
In an October discussion con-
cerning sequestration and the
fiscal cliff, University President
Mary Sue Coleman said it would
be extremely difficult to make
up widespread losses in federal
research funding with private
donations or industry support.
"It's hard for me to imagine
that there won't be bipartisan
support to prevent (a sequester),"
Coleman said. "We'd be shoot-
ing ourselves in the foot at a time
when all these other countries
are pouring money into science."
Forrest said although the out-
look for federal research funding
does not look strong, the Univer-
sity will continue to plan and he
added that the University has
maintained "solid growth" into
2013.
Looking forward, Forrest said
he will focus on anticipating
funding trends, increasingglobal
engagement and seizing research
investment opportunities.
Despite the possibility of
future funding cuts, Forrest used
the opportunity to highlight sev-
eral upcoming research initia-
tives at the University.
The Michigan Mobility Trans-
formation Initiative, also known
as MiMo, funded by the largest
grant to come out of the Depart-
ment of Transportation, will
wire almost 3,000 cars on an
electronic track around the city
of Ann Arbor. The experiment
aims to reduce collisions and

accidents in an urban environ-
ment and could serve as a model
for transportation systems
around the country.
"Wehave atremendous oppor-
tunity to completely transform
how people get around," Forrest
said. "This is one of the biggest
things that we can see on the
horizon. If we invest now, this
(initiative) will become a major
(project) across, we believe, the
globe."
John DeCicco, a School of
Natural Resources and the Envi-
ronment professor, is one of the
collaborating faculty members
on MiMo. Since much of the
project is still in its early stages,
DeCicco said the initiative's
brainstorming efforts have not
been influenced by the threat of
a looming sequester.
Even though much of the
team's current discussions have
not revolved around funding,
DeCicco is confident that politi-
cal parties will recognize the
importance of the field.
"We're very confident that
we're going to be able to be able
to make a compelling case to not
only the federal government but
the state government, industrial
partners, and many other inter-
ested parties," DeCicco said.
"There's a big opportunity here
to bring multiple players togeth-
er in a very positive way."
DeCicco added that the proj-
ect continues to generate excite-
ment due to its implications for
transportation safety and energy
management, as well as for the
generation of economic opportu-
nities in the region.

"The context is not about
how to make up federal funding
shortfalls," DeCicco said. "We're
more trying to come up with the
great ideas. In my experience,
there are always ups and downs
on funding, and what carries the
bag are good ideas and good peo-
ple and that's what we've been
concentrating on."
In addition to MiMo, Forrest
said the University will fund
social science research analyzing
how American society adapts to
an aging population in the 21st
century. The collection of proj-
ects will involve a partnership
between the social science fac-
ulties and companies in the Ann
Arbor area.
In an interview after the
meeting, Forrest said the proj-
ect is an effort to integrate social
scientists and other scientists to
create a collaborative environ-
ment for producing research.
He added that the University
intends to remain on the fore-
front of international research by
collaborating with Universities
across the globe, including insti-
tutions in China and Israel.
Concluding the presentation,
Forrest said he hopes to use self-
investment and diverse methods
of funding to create long-term
success.
"Our principal objective will
always be and always remain
to attract, retain and produce
the talent and ideas that will
drive the U.S. economy into the
future," Forrest said.

REGENTS APPROVE WEST
QUAD RENOVATION
To complement the South Quad
projects,theboard approveda$114.5
million West Quad renovation,
which will include plumbing and
heating improvements and a new
roofforthe agingresidencehall.
The project will commence in
2014 on the heels of South Quad's
completion. With South Quad's
new Central Campus Dining Cen-
ter, the West Quad renovation
will eliminate the dorm's kitchen
and dining hall in favor of new
common spaces and study areas.
Built in 1937, West Quad is the
third residence hall scheduled for
construction as part of the Uni-
versity's Residential Life Initia-
tive, designed to update facilities
associated with living on campus.
"The goals of the program
were to ensure that we had state-
of-the-art life-safety programs,
to upgrade the infrastructure in
heritage facilities, to modernize
our dining facilities across cam-
pus, to introduce different styles
of living arrangements arid to
design facilities that allow for
better connection between living
and learning," University Hous-
ing Director Linda Newman said
in an interview.
E. Royster Harper, the Univer-
sity's vice president for student
affairs, said the renovation will
create community spaces similar
to the Hill residence halls.
"(West Quad) has been an
important community to gen-
erations of Michigan students,"
Harper said during the meeting.
"Our students spend a great deal
of time in their campus homes,
which are vitally important for
their social experiences, to their
academic studies and to their per-
sonal identity within the Univer-

sity community."
Harper listed improvements
common spaces, temperature con-
trol and privacy in community bath-
roomsas key aspects ofthe project.

The board also approved plans
to renovate the off-campus Var-
sity Drive building and prepare
it to hold dry museum research
collections from several Central
Campus buildings.
Additionally, the project will
relocate related lab spaces and
select offices of the anthropology,
paleontology and zoology depart-
ments currently at the Ruthven
Museums Building, the Campus
Safety Services Building and the
C.C. Little Science Building to the
renovated space on Varsity Drive.
"It's a very large project but it
will really simplify and improve
the research and accessibility to
the collections," Slottow said.
Funded by LSA, the $27.5-mil-
lion project is expected to improve
administrative efficiency by combin-
ing the collections with wet speci-
men collections currently located in
the Varsity Drive building.
Located off East Ellsworth-
Road between State Street and
Stone School Road, the building
is currently a warehouse. Reno-
vations will include temperature
and humidity controls, as well as
architectural, mechanical and
electrical improvements to facili-
tate the new additions.
Architectural firm Smith-
GroupJJR will design the 71,000
square feet Varsity Drive build-
ing renovation. These plans will
also be submitted for approval at
a future meeting.
Schematic Design for College of
Pharmacy renovations approved.
The board approved schematic
design plans to improve the main
entrance and 12,000 square feet

of the basement and first floor of
the College of Pharmacy Building.
The school's budget will fund
the $2.6-million project and com-
pletion is projected for next fall.
In a message to the board,
Slottow wrote the project will
"address accessibility issues and
provide a more welcoming entry."
UNIVERSITY
APPOINTMENTS
APPROVED
The regents approved the
appointment of Martha Pollack,
the University's vice provost of
budgetary affairs, to be the Uni-
versity's next provost.
The announcement was made
in January that Coleman would
present Pollack for the two year
appointment. Pollack will replace
University Provost Phil Hanlon,
whoisleavingthe UniversityinJuly
to become the next president of his
alma mater, Dartmouth College.
Pollack currently works in
Hanlon's office crafting the Uni-
versity budget, including the
general fund budget, as well as
helping with the space-saving
initiatives to better use classroom
space and other projects.
A University faculty member
since 2000, Pollack was previously
dean of the School of Information.
In her new role as provost, Pol-
lack will oversee the budget as
the University's' chief budgetary
officer. She will also advise aca-
demic affairs as the University's
chief academic officer. She will
continue to serve as a professor in
the School of Information and the
College of Engineering.
Additionally, the regents
approved LSA Dean Terrence
McDonald to become the director of
the BentleyHistoricalLibrary when
histerm as LSAdeanisoveronAug.

West, the Law School's associate
dean for academic affairs and Nip-
pon Life Professor of Law, as the
next Law School dean.

withholding part of a descrip-
tion, that would not be some-
thing that we do."
Brown said anything that can
help build awareness about sex-
ual assault - including working
with the "I Will" campaign to
improve crime alerts - will only
benefit the community.
"We love to dialogue with any
group on campus," Brown said.
"Certainly this group sounds like a
group thatistryingto ashine alight
on safety issues from a student-to-
student perspective, and that can
only be much more beneficial."
The coffeehouse conversa-
tion, also delved into students'
perception of sexual assault.

LSA junior Elise Coletta said
while issues such as the time
delay and minimal information
provided in crime alerts are
problematic, there are broader
matters on campus that need to
be addressed first.
"I think it will be more ben-
eficial to invest more time and
energy and money into fostering
a climate on campus that doesn't
allow that sort of thing to happen
in the first place," Coletta said.
The group also discussed
the problem of victim blaming
and its prevalence across cam-
pus. Lieberman said this type
of behavior comes with a lack of
education about the issue.
"One of the priorities for us is
to figure out how we can improve
that education in a proactive,
positive way," Lieberman said.

prise-oriented," Gurman said.
"That launch was the same week
as Microsoft's enterprise pro
tablet, so that was an interesting
turn of events as far as the busi-
ness, professional aspect of tech-
nology is concerned."
Business Insider recently
called Gurman the "World's Best
Apple Reporter," noting that he
beat out The New York Times,
The Wall Street Journal, Bloom-
berg and most other news outlets
on that story. CNN noted that
seven out of eight of his predic-
tions for Apple product launches
were correct. The eighth turned
out to be true in time.
Gurman said the site has
"industry sources" from within
Apple that regularly come to
them with news. After getting
information from any source, no
matter their reliability, Gurman
will validate the information
withevidence. Inthe mostrecent
case, an iOS code, Apple's land-
mark mobile operating system.

Gurman said he's reached
expert status for his job and in
his field. In addition to areported
six-figure salary, his knowledge
also comes in handy for assist-
ing his friends and family with
simple technological repairs.
Since coming to college, Gur-
man said his time-commitment
level has changed. He is now writ-
ing more on a case-by-case basis
since courses are his first priority.
"It's pretty unorthodox not to
have a specific posting quota asa
reporter, but Seth is very accom-
modating because he trusts
me and my work, and I'm very
thankful for him for that," Gur-
man said. "A lot of the stories that
I write are big, exclusive stories
specific to the industry and so if I
get two to three of those a month,
it's great, and that works with my
writing and school schedule."
In high school --outside of class-
es and social life - Gurman would
occasionally postup to 20 to 30 sto-
ries to 9toSMac per day, especially
around new product launches.
About a month ago, Gurman
wrote a story regarding the
release of the then-new iPhone 5

The University's interim Title
IX policy, which mandates how
the University will respond
to reports of sexual assault,
was also addressed. Under the
interim policy, any "responsible
University employee" - which
does not include staff at SAPAC,
Counseling and Psychological
Services or a religiously-affili-
ated employee - is required to
report any instance of sexual
assault they are made aware of to
their coordinator.
"There's still a lot of questions
as to what a 'responsible Uni-
versity employee' is," Buoy said.
"That's something we're trying
to push forward ... we have a lot
of questions on it still."
A finalized Title IX policy
will reportedly be implemented
sometime next year.
at the same time he was visiting
the Detroit International Auto
Show with friends. It should
come as no surprise that he
wrote the story via his iPhone,
which Gurman says is his most-
used Apple possession.
Though Gurman enjoys writ-
ing, he's currently in the process
of applying tothe Business School,
with his sights set on the busi-
ness side of technology. He said
he plans on staying with 9to5Mac
because of the site's reach, as well
as the network he's cultivated.
"Even though everyone I work
with is older and this is their pro-
fessional career, I feel like they
respect me because of the work
that I'm able to do," Gurman said.
"They couldn't do what they do
without me, I couldn't do what I
do without them, so it's a team."
Gurman said he feels that at
this point in his career writing for
9to5Mac, he's at "the top" of his
field and is happy with the stories
he's been able to accomplish.
"It's random sometimes," Gur-
man said of his work. "It's fun,
it's fierce, it's tiring, butI love that
anything can happen at any time."

ISRAEL
From Page 1
for Israeli policy stances - col-
laborated with StandWithUS, a
non-profit educational and advo-
cacy group that promotes Israeli
interests, to bring the two former
Israeli soldiers, Ari and Lital, to
campus in order to put a "human
face" on the IDF.
"We have meetings and we talk
about all this stuff and we hold
events ... but you're thousands of
miles away from the conflict,"
Kaufman said. "But to put a face
to them, to be able to interact
with actual Israelis that live and
breathe that kind of life and pro-
vide an open forum to see what
life is like."
Talking in mixed English and
Hebrew, both soldiers only used
their first names during the con-
ference for unspecified reasons.
During their presentation, they
emphasized that they want a two-
state solution but said that Hamas,
the group that governs Gaza and is
classified as a terrorist organiza-
tion by the United States, wouldn't
grant any concessions. For the
bulk of the talk, both soldiers field-
ed questions from the audience
about the Arab-Israeli conflict.
They also told personal sto-
ries about their time in combat.
Ari, now a software engineer,
recalled a time when a paramedic
in his unit, Jonathan, was killed
during a mission to arrest a sus-
pected terrorist in the West Bank.
He claimed his friend was killed
because Israeli rules of engage-


ment dictate that soldiers can-
not shoot until they are directly
threatened.
"on the one hand you want to
stop the terrorists, on the other
hand you want to avoid as much
as possible hurting innocent civil-
ians," Ari said.
Both served in combat positions
and frequently noted the difficulty
of living under constant threat
of rocket fire. They claimed that
nearly everyone in Israel knew at
least one person who had been a
touched by terrorism.
"I can't really describe to you
what it means to be an 18-year-old
girl who goes out to a nightclub
and cannot think what to wear,
just about 'is it safe'... her mother
is at home worried sick for when
she'll be back, if she'll be back,"
Lital said.
During the question-and-
answer portion, one student
brought up a scandal the IDF
faced earlier this week that
involved an IDF soldier purport-
edly posting an Instagram photo
of a Palestinian child in the cross-
hairs of his sniper rifle. Both Ari
and Lital condemned the picture
and assured the crowd that the
IDF doesn't view all Palestinians
as the enemy.
"Ifa soldier is doing something
inappropriate in the West Bank,
it's not something that is common
or acceptable and usually that sol-
ider will be punished by his com-
manders and be judged by his
peers," Lital said.
Nick Lieber, a StandWithUs
campus coordinator, said the talks
with soldiers were started in order

to humanize IDF soldiers because
the media presented a skewed
portrait of them. The group's host-
ing of IDF soldiers last year was
met with protests by groups that
advocate for Palestine.
"It was response to disinfor-
mation about Israel in the media
during the Second Intifada, so our
mission is to educate about Israel
and about the conflict," Lieber
said. "The whole point is to put
a human face to the IDF because
people hear stories about the
Israeli army, and you never meet
the people and hear their actual
stories."
LSA junior Samia Ayyash said
she was disappointed with the
event and claimed that the former
soldiers presented a biased view of
the complex conflict and that they
dehumanized the Palestinian side.
She added that, as someone of Pal-
estinian descent, she has seen Pal-
estinian civilians beaten by IDF
soldiers and took offense to the
former soldiers referring to the
Palestinians as "terrorists."
"The Palestinian side is trying
to rid what they see as terrorist
attacks, the attacks on humanity
the attacks ontheir identity,they're
striving for civil rights for water,
for the rights to move," Ayyash
said. "There are two sides to the
conflict and one side was clearly
not acknowledged here today."
Although Ayyash was pleased
that many students came up to
her after the event to thank her
for coming and for asking critical
questions, she felt that dialogue
alone won't solve the Arab-Israeli
conflict.

Prevent Pell Grant fraud
Colleges and universities must create policies to stop abuse
The Federal Pell Grant Program - which distributes need-
based grants to college students - is crucial to college afford-
ability. In the 2011-2012 academic year, the program helped
over nine million students attend college. Some students, however, are
registering for classes in order to obtain a Pell Grant and then imme-
diately dropping out - pocketing the leftover money. Last school year,
this kind of fraud cost taxpayers $1.2 billion. Colleges and universities
in Michigan and across the country must ensure that they have policies
in place that enable them to prevent Pell Grant fraud and to track down
students who have abused money that is vital to a strong workforce.

To start things off on a
rather bleak note, yester-
day, an independent review
team officially
declared the
city of Detroit
to be in a state
of financial
emergency. And,
unfortunately,,
it's not all that
surprising. SARAH
Our economy SKALUBA
remains stag-
nant, the job
market dreary
and unemployment continues to
plague millions of Americans.
It's clear there's no miracle solu-
tion to this never-ending dilemma.
If there were, President Barack
Obama would have our coun-
try back on its feet and leading
the global economy with a snap
of his fingers. However, Detroit
City Council hopeful Attie Pollard
believes he knows otherwise. The
magic fix to all our fiscal problems
is not economic reform or higher
taxes, but prostitution. Yup, Pollard
believes a practice banned in every
state besides Nevada - and Lord
knows what they're doing over
there - will be the cure to the city's
crumbling economy.
In a radio interview last week,
Pollard explained this novel solu-
tion: "For instance, starting off with
a strip club district ... Once the time
goes on, we can see if brothels or
other means of sexual entertainment
are needed." How lovely, right?
I can already picture the con-
versations this project would spark
on campus:
"Guys, let's go to Detroit this
weekend!"
"Why would we visit that dump?
The Tigers haven't won a game

all season."
"No, man, to visit the new red-
light district, duh."
And to be honest, the young men
and college students that would inev-
itably be attracted by the change of
venues would be the least of the city's
worries. HasDetroitreallybecomeso
desperate that City Council leaders
are throwing around ideas involving
brothels and a possible red-light dis-
trict toget the economy back on track
and increase tourism? Maybe it's just
me, but a project like this won't be
attracting your everyday, family-
friendly tourists looking to spend a
casual weekend in one of America's
favorite rust-belt cities. Nope, I'm
thinking it will instead attract a dan-
gerous mix of individuals involved in
serious crime including sex traffick-
ing, drugtrade and the like.
Maybe Pollard was just desper-
ate for a new idea to garner sup-
port for his campaign. Regardless
of his intentions, prostitution is an
extremely dangerous practice. It
has ruined thousands of lives across
the United States and is often con-
nected to illegal drug use, rape,
assault and sex trafficking. So why
would anyone in their right mind
want to use prostitution as a means
of tourism and economic incentive?
In the United States, prostitution
is the most dangerous job a person
can come by, with 204 murders per
every 100,000 individuals work-
ing in the field. Moreover the aver-
age American sex worker begins
at the extremely young age of 13
years. Not only would a proposal
like Pollard's prove detrimental
to poor women and children liv-
ing in Detroit and the surrounding
neighborhoods, but it would pro-
vide strong economic incentives to
adopt a destructive lifestyle that
otherwise wouldn't prove practical.

By making the naive assumption
that all women involved in sex work
"know what the risk is, and ... what
the hazards are," Pollard manages
to ignore the fact that many of these
women are brought to America via
transnational sex trafficking. Sex
trafficking, a major human rights
violation, uses coercion and threats
to force women into exploitative
situations like prostitution. Not
only do these women have no safe
way out, but they are often brought
thousands of miles away from their
homes and families as well. The
destructive costs of human rights
violations, intense violence and
widespread rape will never out-
weigh the profits of a select few.
204 prostitutes
are killed for
every 100,00
working.
Sure, prostitution brings in mas-
sive amounts of money for certain
individuals involved - a.k.a. the
pimps, sex traffickers and drug
dealers - but in no way is it a seri-
ous solution to the greater issue at
hand. Rather than encouraging sex
trafficking in an already violent,
economically wounded city, Detroit
leaders and state officials should be
looking for viable answers that will
create jobs and bring in much need-
ed funding. As for Pollock's propo-
sition, it's just not sexy.

Pell Grant funds, which range from $500
to $5,500, are distributed through a two-step
process. First, higher education institutions
distribute the grants by putting them towards
tuition. Then, they send recipients a check for
the rest of the grant. It's at this second stage
that fraud occurs, with some students taking
that check andnever attendingclass. Only some
colleges and universities have policies aimed at
curbing this behavior, such as requiring Pell
recipients to provide a bank account or credit-
card number in case of fraud, or having profes-
sors take attendance for the first few weeks of
class and delaying grant payments.
Schools making an effort to stop fraud, how-
ever, should keep in mind that Pell Grants are
designed to help students - not to embroil
them in bureaucracy or to make it harder to
earn a degree. Community college students
are especially at risk for this, since the fraud is
worst at that level. Since some Michigan com-
munity colleges have tuition as low as $700 for
a full-time course load, a Pell Grant can often
cover the cost of tuition with ample money to
spare. (Whatever form anti-fraud efforts take,
they must include some leeway for students
who can't make it to every class or who need
ALEX EDWARDS VIE ON
Come out f
The campus climate for LGBTQ individuals
is anything but great. This may be surprising
given that the University prides itself in offer-
ing a welcoming environment for everyone.
After all, Michigan houses the first-of-its-kind
LGBTQ community center, recently imple-
mented gender-inclusive housing options and
supported its student body president when
faced with nefarious bigotry. Yet LGBTQ indi-
viduals are far less welcomed on campus today
than our formal institutions, traditions and
anecdotes suggest.
I returned to AnnArbor onlyweeks ago after
spending three years in London and Wash-
ington, D.C. Since returning, I've encountered
more men who have sex with men but outward-
ly rejectcbeing labeled "gay" than in all my pre-
vious 36 months spent elsewhere. It is the same
for the number of times I've heard "fag" hurled
as a pejorative. On two occasions - admitted-
ly, both at bars after 1 a.m. - I've been on the
receiving end of hate speech.
Rather than a prevalence of prejudice and
negative stereotyping among just a few stu-
dents, these experiences taken together under-
score an active culture of discrimination. Often
masked, and varyingly resonate, it's a real and
perverse reality.
Not convinced? Look no further than a
recent Daily article in which an anonymous
male senior detailed the "secret" hook-up
culture among closeted men on campus. Con-
tinue to laugh when your friends use negative
epithets, the author suggests. Endure the anti-
quated, intolerant views of your politics, reli-
gion and parents. Coming out is hard, so don't
bother. Just look online for sex.
It's precisely these elements - overt preju-
dice, internalization of guilt and acceptance
of the status quo - that fashion LGBTQ infe-
riority on campus. Oppression, acquiescence
and more oppression. It's a dynamic culture
that we - gay and straight alike - continue
to reproduce. And, more importantly, one that
we can change.
The gay struggle is unique in its individual
effect - the intrinsic power of LGBTQ people to
change perceptions and thereby create change.
Among historical struggles for equality, this
powerful role of the individual is the exception,
rather than the rule. Just try to imagine the
Civil Rights Movement if African Americans
fought oppression by convincing whites of their
individual merit,nrather than through a collec-
tive struggle against racism.
Not so with gays. Poll after poll shows the
close link between increasing acceptance for
LGBTQ rights with the percent of individuals
who know someone who identifies as gay. It's

the extra money immediately in order to make
ends meet.)
Continued fraud in the Pell Grant pro-
gram would not just be a waste of money, it
would also make it even more difficult for
students to obtain the grants and a college
education. The program has already faced
cuts; the number of semesters that a student
can receive the grants was reduced last year
from 18 to 12, and the maximum income level
for receiving a full grant dropped signifi-
cantly as well. A college education translates
to between $250,000 and $350,000 more in
earnings over a person's lifetime, and the
knowledge obtained at college enables stu-
dents to engage more deeply with the world.
There are too many people dependent on
Pell Grants to cut the program because of a
few instances of fraud. Policy changes would
work just as well.
In a time of constantly rising tuition rates
and growing income inequality, the cost of
college is an ever more salient issue. Ensur-
ing that Pell Grants are used for their intend-
ed purpose is vital for the program's integrity
and effectiveness, as well as the promoting of
higher education.
or equality
surprisingly simple. Coming out diminishes
prejudice and advances equality. It breaks the
circle of intolerance.
Focusing on the incredible power of LGBTQ
individuals to effect change is just that. It nei-
ther places them at greater fault for continued
injustice, nor minimalizes the complexity sur-
rounding the coming out process.
Is it hard? Of course. You must be prepared
for some to think less of them, but you must
also have the strength to realize that these
people don't matter. I'm the first to admit that
fear of "being outed" pervaded many of my
formative years.
Is coming out personally liberating? Abso-
lutely. In fact, there are few things greater than
the euphoria of finally being free with yourself,
your family and your friends.
More importantly, is it transformational?
Incredibly so. When I came out to my closest
group of high school friends, whom can only be
described as bro-er than bro, not only did our
relationships strengthen, but they themselves
also changed. They invested in my experience
as a gay man, paying particular interest to
the struggles I faced. They consciously made
efforts to rid anti-gay slurs from their rhetoric.
They called out prejudice where it manifested
in their circles. Two even joined me in canvass-
ingfor equal marriage.
Not all transformations will be of this type.
Few may change their views on equal rights;
even fewer will hit the pavement for equality.
But, in the words of Harvey Milk, once people
realize "that (gay and lesbians) are indeed their
children, that we are indeed everywhere -
every lie, every myth, every innuendo will be
destroyed once and for all."
So, to every openly homophobic bigot, for
whom no amount of knowledge or familiarity
will lessen his or her prejudice: an unapologetic
fuck you.
To the frat star, who after hooking up last
weekend called me a goddamn queer, the face-
less Grindr torso, the guilt-ridden bisexual, the
closeted B-school student, biology major and
aspiring engineer, who in their silence legiti-
mize the notion that being gay is shame-wor-
thy: please, please come out.
Turn inward and accept yourself; you will
not outgrow it or evolve in any other direc-
tion. Talk to a friend; talk to anyone. Take
your time; do it on your own terms. But make
sure to do it. Our rights - and your happiness
- depend on it.
And for those that still refuse, well, then,
fuck you too.

0 h, you're from Michi-
gan? Which Great
Lake do you live
closest to: Erie,
Huron, Michi-
gan, Ontario or
Superior?" Alex
asked me.
Normally,
this question
wouldn't be
especially odd if PATRICK
it were asked by
a Midwesterner MAILLET
or perhaps a par-
ticularly inquisi-
tive American. Instead, I was asked
this question by an 8-year-old boy
who had never left the city of Hang-
zhou, China.
I spent a month of this past sum-
mer teaching English in Hang-
zhou, a city about an hour away
from Shanghai. Part of my job was
hosting "English hours" in local
libraries, where I would help locals
practice their English.
It was during one of these "Eng-
lish hours" that I met Alex - which
isn't actually his given name; it was
the English name he chose at the
beginning of his studies.
After Alex asked me the Great
Lakes question, I felt two equal-
ly powerful emotions. The first
one was sheer amazement at how
impressive it was that this boy
knew where Michigan was in the
United States, let alone the fact
that he could name all of the Great
Lakes. The second emotion was
embarrassment. I'm from New Jer-
sey and, unfortunately, I never paid
attention to the Great Lakes and I
certainly don't know which one
Ann Arbor is closest too. (Admit-
tedly, I had to double-check the
names of the Great Lakes when I
wrote this column).
I asked Alex if he was the smart-
est kid in his class. He informed me
- in perfect English, mind you - that
in his class of 100 children, he fell
somewhere in the middle - not much
more than an average student at his

local elementary school. Just an aver-
age 8-year-old Chinese boy - with a
better understanding of U.S. geogra-
phythan a21-year-old American.
China, like many other countries,
is currently investing huge amounts
of resources toward improving
their primary and secondary edu-
cation systems. Although China
certainly has some catching up to
do with developed Western coun-
tries, its test scores, literacy rates
and the number of students gaining
a secondary education are all rap-
idly growing at a rate that may soon
match the best.
While China realizes that invest-
ing in education is a great way to
ensure future economic and societal
growth, America continues to slash
funding for schools and fire teach-
ers. Not surprisingly, our test scores
have begun to show it. According to
a recent study by Harvard Univer-
sity, "... students in Shanghai who
recently took international exams
for the first time outscored every
other school system in the world.
In the same test, American students
ranked 25th in math, 17th in science
and 14th in reading."
America once dominated the
global student test score ratings.
Unfortunately, we now have things
that our government finds more
vital than education. For example,
an NPR study found that, up until
the end of 2011, the United States
was paying an annual $20.2 billion
for costs associated with providing
air conditioning to troops in Iraq
and Afghanistan. Let China worry
about tomorrow's problems, we
need to focus on keeping cool. For
the record, I'm not advocating that
U.S. soldiers should be forced to suf-
fer in 125-degree heat. Instead, I'm
just shedding light on what some of
the money spent on our multi-tril-
lion dollar wars may ha'e done if it
were used more effectively. Also, I
use the phrase "multi-trillion dol-
lar wars" because no one really
knows how much our conflicts in
the Middle East will end up cost-

ing this country, though estimates
range anywhere between $1.2 and
$3.6 trillion.
The earlier a child
attends school, the
better prepared he
or she is for college.
So what can America do to reig-
nite its education system other
than going back in time and invest-
ing money spent on war on schools
and teachers instead? Among
many things, we have to expand
our education system to include
pre-kindergarten schooling for all
American children. As President
Barack Obama pointed out in his

child begins school, the better pre-
pared he or she is for either gaining a
higher education or learning a tech-

As deficit reduction talks con-
tinue and the financial sequester
looms, funding for education is
likely to continue to stagnate, if not
decline. If America does not repair
its education system soon, we may
be in for a dark future. Yes, invest-
ing in our education system will be
expensive. Yes, we are at a point
when fiscal responsibility is cru-
cial. But remember, an investment
toward a child's education is one
that never stops paying dividends
not only to that child, but to society
as a whole.
We need to invest in our future
and revamp the American educa-
tion system. After all, our society
can't depend on a generation that

Marsalis also acknowledges the
influence of his hometown, New

"(New Orleans) has made me
appreciate the history of the
music," Marsalis said. "New
Orleans has music that was born
out of the city. It's still sustained
in a way, and it made me appreci-

I even use those elements when I
play more updated music."
This weekend, however, Mar-
salis is touring with his own band,
the Jason Marsalis Vibes Quartet.
It includes pianist Austin John-
son, bassist Will Goble and drum-
mer David Potter. Marsalis first
met his bandmates while on a
teaching residency at Florida State
University.
"What struck me about those
guys was that they were really
serious about the music and real-
ly committed to it, and I thought
I would give them a chance,"
Marsalis said. "They're very seri-
ous about the music that we are
playing, and they've really grown
throughout the process."
Jason Marsalis will be the
third Marsalis brother to appear
at the Kerrytown Concert House.
As the youngest brother, he cer-
tainly hasn't had a head start in
making his name known or per-
forming across the country. How-
ever, he isn't concerned with that
sense of following in anybody's
footsteps.
"What it means to follow them
is something I don't worry about
because I play music on my own
terms," Marsalis said. "I have my
goals that I'm thinking about, and
I have music that I need to work
on to become a better musician.
It's not about what they've done
in the past. I believe in that music,
but I'm not worried about follow-
ing that. I'm worried about look-
ing in terms of the present and the
future in terms of a musician."

PERFORMANCE PREVIEW
'Hothouse' to explore
human interactions

By PAIGE PFLEGER
Daily Arts Writer
Hunan interactions today seem
to have been reduced to texting
and Facebook messaging. How-
ever, School of
Music, Theatre
& Dance senior The Hot-
and directing house
major Emily
Lyon hopes to Fridayat7:0O
challenge these p.m. and11:00
ideals in her p.m.,Saturday
senior thesis at7:00 p.m.
with the pre-
sentation of the Walgreen
play, "The Hot- Drama Center
house," by Har- Free
old Pinter.
"The Hot-
house" takes place in what
appears to be a mental institution
or asylum, though this is not ever
explicitly stated - a quirk that is
common in Pinter's plays. Lyon
chose to set the play in the United
States in 1984, giving it a moder-
nity the 1950s-written play did not
formerly have.
"I think the show is very appro-
priate for our time," Lyon said. "I
always try to pick pieces that will
say something to who we are now
and the audience we'll be address-
ing. 'The Hothouse' is a mockery
and a condemnation of bureaucra-
cy, more or less, and it shows us in a
time of Facebook, military drones
and systemized health care that
institutionalizing human interac-

tion is not what we do best."
The show develops a Clue-
like game of whodunit. After an
alleged murder and rape takes
place in the sanatorium, the char-
acters scramble humorously to
find the culprit, causing the play
to take on a comedic sense while
dealing with more serious themes.
"The characters themselves are
given numbers instead of names,
which ties into the distancing of
humanity," Lyon said. "It's a chess
game from there of what has hap-
pened and who is going to chal-
lenge the system, if anyone."
The show, taking place in Wal-
green Drama Center's Studio One,
is unusual because it is not often
that the University puts on Pinter
plays. Pinter is known for a few
trademarks, one being the Pinter
pause, which places emphasis on
the words and gives actors time to
reflect on them. Because of Pint-
er's quirks, his plays can some-
times be a challenge.
"For the theater majors, this is
definitely a different experience
and a different type of theater
overall," Lyon said. "One chal-
lenge we've been having is that in
finding whatthis institution is like
and dealing with how intention-
ally vague Pinter can be, it has to
go against a lot of actors instincts
to create a very tense and funny
show."
The cast has had a great deal of
bonding time on and off stage by
researching the show through dif-

ferent kinds of games. They have
played a game of Assassin (which
is still on-going), Clue and even
an English tea time. Lyon believes
the small cast has really made her
senior thesis special.
"The cast is amazing, and I was
extremely fortunate to get one of
the strongest casts that I could
have possibly put together," Lyon
said. "They are certainly seven
heavy hitters. They challenge me
and they inspire me, and it's been
really wonderful."
Lyon's senior
thesis puts
modern twist on
Pinter's play.
Lyon focuses her energy in try-
ing to convey a certain aesthetic,
and with her last act as an under-
graduate, she hopes "The Hot-
house" will continue to display it.
"I focus in on trying to tell the
best story, and making sure that
every single moment is interesting
and alive," she said. "I love color-
ful characters and what draws
me to theater is thorough under-
standing and pinpointing of genu-
ine humanity. Often, what we find
funny about theater is seeing our-
selves in it."

"Runaway love."
Taylor too swift with romances

By LENA FINKEL songs p
Daily Arts Writer tragedi
And

Taylor Swift is officially dating
Conor Kennedy. No, she's dating
Harry Styles. No, she's dating
John Mayer, or maybe Bradley
Cooper - OK, that last one only
applies to Jennifer Lawrence. But
it's no secret that Taylor Swift has
had her fair share of romances;
she's jumped around from guy to
guy, only staying single for about
five minutes.
Swift prides herself on being
a good role model for young girls
and has even made a career out
of it, but what does this say about
the example she sets for her fans?
Swift only dated her last boy-
friend, Harry Styles of One Direc-
tion, for about two months, and
yet she had already planned to
buy a house in the United King-
dom, down the road from Styles.
Though she claimed the location
was merely a coincidence, when
the two split, she immediately
stopped looking. So, coincidence?
Probably not.
You'll notice, of course, that
Styles never looked to buy a house
near Swift in the United States.
Not to mention that Swift has
become infamous for writing

In Southern California, the
California Highway Patrol
alerted officers in at least three
counties to be on the lookout
for the SUV.
Las Vegas police Sgt. John
Sheahan said the Range Rover
was last seen near the Vene-
tian resort as it headed north
from the shooting scene on Las
Vegas Boulevard.
Witnesses also told police
the SUV and Maserati had
come from the nearby City-
Center area, the home of Aria,
just south of the site of the
attack.
"We have numerous wit-
nesses to this," Sheahan said.
"But what is the genesis of
this? We don't know yet."
Predawn jogger Eric Lackey
was on his way back to the New
York-New York hotel when he
snapped a cellphone photo of
the blazing scene moments after
the crash. Black smoke billowed
from the flaming taxi, amid pop-
pingsounds from the fire.
Lackey, of Forest Hill, Md.,
said a security officer in a yel-
low shirt performed CPR on a
person on the sidewalk while
police officers canvassed a
small crowd of perhaps 15

onlookers gathering at the
scene.
"Police were asking if any-
one was still in the vehicles and
if they heard gunfire," Lackey
told The Associated Press.
"That's when I realized it
wasn't just a regular accident."
Sheahan said police have
video from traffic cameras
at the intersection and were
checking hotel surveillance
systems. The video will not be
made public, he said.
Police did not release the
names of the people who were
killed, citing the ongoing
investigation.
The crumpled, gray Masera-
ti, which had no license plate,
came to rest several feet away
from the incinerated taxi.
"The people I feel sorry for
are the people in the taxi," said
Elvina Joyce, a tourist from
Regina, Saskatchewan. "Sec-
onds made all the difference
in the world for them. Wrong
place, wrong time."
The area near the scene has
been the site of high-profile
violence in the past.
Rapper Tupac Shakur was
killed in a drive-by shooting
in 1996 about a block away
under similar circumstances,
as assailants opened fire on his
luxury sedan from a vehicle on
Flamingo Road. The killing has
never been solved.

CEOs of non-profits
gather to talk
about challenges
By MICHAEL MAAS
Daily StaffReporter
At the Nonprofit and Public
Management Center's second
annual Education Leaders Forum
on Thursday, participants dis-
cussed ways to attract education
leaders to Detroit.
About 30 students attended the
event, which included a discussion
panel of four leaders with expertise
in education in Detroit. Panelists
included Scott Morgan, the found-
er and CEO of Education Pioneers,
an education recruitment firm;
Dan Varner, the CEO of Excellent
Schools Detroit, a non-profit group
working to improve education in
Detroit; Kendra Hearn, a Clinical
Assistant Professor at the School
of Education; and Lesley Redwine,
the CEO and Superintendent of
New Urban Learning, a non-profit
charter management organization.
The forum followed the NPM's
Social Impact Challenge, a contest
forgraduatestudents' educationideas
that took place earlier in the day.
"The point of the Social Impact
Challenge is to allow students at
Michigan the chance to work on a
real-life problem for an organiza-
tion that focuses on social impact.
So in this case, Education Pioneers
is tackling a real important issue
for our nation, which is how to cre-
ate a better pipeline of leaders into
the space," said Rishi Moudgil, the
managing director of NPM.
Morgan said he agreed to speak
in the panel and act as a judge for
the social impact challenge because
he wanted to hear the students'
insights, which he could possibly
implement in his organization.
"The caliber of thought and
analysis in the short time frame
with which they had to analyze all
the data and make recommenda-
tions was incredibly impressive,"
Morgan said. "We have a number
of ideas that we are going to be able
to run with in a high-quality way."
Hearn, an assistant professor at the
School of Education and University

coordinator forthe Teach for America-
Detroit Program,was also amember of
the panel. Born and raised in Detroit,
she said she believes city residents are
keytoeducationreforminthecity.
"My greatest aspiration was to go
back to Detroit and educate her chil-
dren so they can have the opportuni-
ties that I was afforded because I had
an excellent education,"Hearnsaid.
The discussion panel was followed
by an announcement ofthe winners of
the Social Impact Challenge Awards.
The winning team, Focus Education,
consisted of graduate students Vinita
Vishwanarayan, Stefana Vutova, Lau-
ren Sheram, Nellie Tsai. They were
awarded $2,500for their presentation.
"It feels really good because ina
short span we came together from
all these differentschools and came
up with ideas that not only had
implications in terms of a finan-
cial perspective, but also a social
impact," Vishwanarayan said.
Morgan gave the keynote speech
afterthe announcementofthewin-
ner. He highlighted the importance
of leadership in education.
"First, leadership matters and it
matters at all levels," Morgan said.
"Secondly, leaders can have tremen-
dous leverage. They get leverage by
developing other leaders and they
have leverage in the terms of the way
theyspenddollars.Andthenthethird
thingis thatleadershipis thekeylever
intransformingurbaneducation.'
Business senior Lilliane Webb
came to the discussion panel to learn
more about why students at the Uni-
versity should consider working in
education in Detroit.
"The hope that they had for the
city, as someone from the state of
Michigan, that they're not encourag-
ing leaders to go elsewhere to make
a difference was really inspiring,"
Webbsaid.
Education graduate student Raul
Cruz said he is considering a career
in education and came to learn more
about working in an urban environ-
ment.
"I'm from New York City so
I know about education in the
inner-city, but while I'm in the
Midwest,the place I need to focus
my attention is the place where
it's needed the most," Cruz said.
"I've taught before and I hope to
possibly lead in Detroit."

Illinois' Paul wants
to put a ring on it

A final chance
to capture some
momentum on the
road in Columbus
By LIZ VUKELICH
Daily Sports Editor
There's bad news and good
news for the Michigan hockey
team in its upcoming series
against Ohio State this weekend.
The bad news is that the Wol-
verines have to travel to Colum-
bus, a daunting task considering
that they've yet
to put together Michigan at
a good road Ohio $tate
series. Michi-
gan coach Red Matchup:
Berenson has Mich.10-18-2;
continually OSU 13-12-7
lamented the When: Friday
fact that he 6:35 P.M., Sat-
hasn't had a urday 7:05 P.M.
team with such Where: Value
a poor road City Arena
record in years TV/Radio:
- the Wolver- Big Ten Network
ines are cur-
rently 1-8-2 on
the road this season.
So what's the good news? At
least the hostile environment
will be a learning opportuni-
ty, effectively Michigan's last

chance to get some experience
on the road under its belt before
the inevitability of traveling for
the CCHA Tournament in two
weeks time.
The Wolverines (7-15-2 CCHA,
10-18-2 overall) see the upcom-
ing series as the perfect way to
gain some last-minute momen-
tum heading into the final four
games of its regular season.
"(The season's) been tough,"
said sophomore forward Alex
Guptill. "It's going to be nice to
turn a page ... kind of like a fresh
start for us. I think it'll give us a
little bit of energy."
Michigan spent its recent bye
week addressing a laundry list of
problems that have plagued it all
season. But its biggest concern as
it approaches its matchup with
the Buckeyes is its pitiful goals-
against average - around 4.19
per game - which is good for
last in the league. This is in stark
contract to Ohio State (12-7-5,
13-12-7), which boasts one of the
CCHA's best.
"Offensively, we've gotenough
confidence," Berenson said. "If
we get the right situation, we can
find a way to score a couple of
goals. It doesn't do you any good
if you're givingup four or five."
It's no secret that part of the
reason for the Wolverines' piti-
ful goals-against average is that
they have yet to find a consistent

presence in net. Since none of the
three usual starters - freshmen
Steve Racine and Jared Rutledge
and junior Adam Janecyk - have
done much good in the crease,
Berenson will be bringing along
never-used redshirt sophomore
Luke Dwyer for the trip this
weekend.
Berenson has held the name
of the starting goalie close to his
chest all week, and there's no
indication that Dwyer will even
see ice time in Columbus. But as
the Wolverines' only unknown
variable, Berenson felt Dwyer
warranted an opportunity to
travel this weekend.
"We're taking him for a rea-
son," Berenson said. "He's fine,
not out of place. We didn't pay
much attention to him early in
the year (but) he's not just prac-
ticing now, he's practicing to
have a chance to start or play."
Though every weekend the
players and coaches say the
upcoming series is a chance to
redeem their previous missteps,
the Wolverines looked truly
refreshed coming out of this bye
week, even taking time to laugh
and joke around during practice.
"There's a lot of good spirit
in that locker room," Berenson
said. "Our season's not over and
we can be a better team. I think
there's a little more confidence ...
that we haven't seen enough of."

Daily Sports Editor
Under first-year head coach
John Groce, Illinois got off to its
best start in over 100 years when
it went 12-0 in non-conference
play. The Fighting Illini rose to
No. 10 in the polls and were con-
sidered to be a legitimate con-
tender in the Big Ten.
Now that .
conference BEliN E
play is wrap-
ping up,
though, it's
a bit of a dif-
ferent story.
Illinois is
currently 6-7 in league play with
losses to Purdue and Northwest-
ern, but has had signature wins
over Indiana and Minnesota on
the road.
Senior guard Brandon Paul
leads the team as part of the Illi-
ni's duo of explosive guards. Paul
averages 16.4 points per game
- fourth best in the conference
- and scored 43 points against
Ohio State at home last season.
The Daily got a chance to chat
with Paul in October at Big Ten
Media Day.
The Michigan Daily: Do you
feel re-energized by this season?
Last season didn't end well, but
there's a new coach, a new sys-
tem - is there a new outlook
with that as well?
Brandon Paul: Yeah, I think
we have a sense of a clean slate,
everyone starting new. We have
a new coaching staff, they're
looking to do good things this
year. We aren't looking to rebuild
- we're looking to surprise peo-
ple in the Big Ten this year.
TMD: You and fellow senior
D.J. Richardson are experienced
guys, you have some guys left
over from former coach's tenure.
Do you think your experience
will help the players transition
under a newhead coach?
BP: Sam McLaurin is a five-
year guy, a transfer that came
in for us, he's going to help us
out. Me, D.J. and Tyler (Griffey)
are seniors and our sophomores
are all returning at a high level.
Aside from that, we lost Mey-
ers (Leonard) to the draft, but
we pretty much have everyone
returning.
TMD: And as you two are the

experienced players ofthe group,
you and D.J. will be looked at as
the leaders of the young team.
How have you started leading
the team?
BP: I think since our freshman
year, me and D.J. have took that
role upon ourselves (and) we just
stuck together. He's a great kid
- he looks to help everybody on
the team, and it's kind of rubbed
off on me. I usually like to lead by
example, but I've become more
vocal over the past year. I think a
lot of the guys look up to us.
TMD: What is one main
emphasis (John Groce has) given
you so far this season?
BP: Hestoppedusonepractice
and told us to think back when.
we were in high school - 'Oh
yeah, you thought you were play-
ing hard then, but think about
when you got here as a freshman,
you played so much harder.' He
lets us know that every day we
can play a little bit harder than
the day we did before, and I take
that into consideration every day
at practice.
TMD: You dropped 43 points
against Ohio State last year, but
do you think anybody in this
league could do that again this
year, considering the depth of
the Big Ten?
BP: I'm not even worried
about that, I'm more focused
about getting wins. I think obvi-
ously it can be done, since I did it
once before, but I'm not going to
into any games looking to score

43 or 44 points. I let the games
come to me, and if it does, I'll
come through in the end.
TMD: Though you and D.J.
have been the leading scorers on
the team, do you see more of a
team focus coming into Big Ten
season, like all five players on the
floor having to step up to beat
the better teams, like Indiana or
Michigan?
BP: All these teams are so
good,they'regettingbetter every
year. As ateam, if we're going to
lose to somebody, they have to
beat us, we can't beat ourselves.
That's one of Coach Groce's phi-
losophies as well, 'Don't beat
ourselves, make a team play
harder than us.' That's going to
be hard to do, sometimes.
TMD: Groce has some experi-
ence in beating good teams dur-
ing his tenure at Ohio, the most
recent being a win over Michi-
gan in the NCAA Tournament.
Do you think that experience
and the momentum will help
your team this season?
BP: Obviously he's had an
impressive career. He took his
team (to the NCAA Tournament)
the past couple years, so it can be
done. At the end of the season, I
don't want to be worrying about
if we're going to get in or not. I
want to be in the tournament
and competing for a title. First
thing's first, I want to get a Big
Ten ring - that's one thing I'm
focused on and is my attention
on this year.

'M' to meet the Mets again
after series with Fordham

For third time in three weeks,
Wolverines back to Florida

After three walk-off
losses, Wolverines
look to regroup
before exhibition
By ALEX TAYLOR
Daily Sports Writer
Playing outside for one of the
first times of the year, in a dif-
ferent time zone, with a new
coaching staff, the Michigan
baseball team didn't start the
season as they hoped. Despite all
these facts, Michigan coach Erik
Bakich refused to claim moral
victories.
Over the past weekend, Mich-
igan (0-3) lost all three games of
its weekend series against Cali-
fornia (3-0) in walk-off fashion.
Two of these losses occurred
in extra innings with the other
coming in the bottom of the
ninth.
Though there were no moral
victories, the Wolverines had
several positives to take away
from their opening series.
"For us to come out of the
chute with three one-run games
and two extra-inning games,
that's only going to help us
moving forward," Bakich said.
"Although we didn't come up
on top, we got to experience the
atmosphere when the game is on
the line, when every pitch, every
swing, every play counts."
Michigan committed lust

two errors in three games and
got quality starts out of its two
pitchers, sophomore James
Bourque and freshman Evan
Hill. Offensivelyjunior outfield-
er Michael O'Neill led the Wol-
verines and started the season
hitting at a torrid pace, going
6-of-13 with three doubles.
Another
force at the
plate was Michigan vs.

Though the MGoBlue.com
Wolverines can
point to several
bright spots in their opening
series, they didn't achieve their

ultimate goal of winning the
weekend.
Luckily for Michigan, though,
it will get another opportunity
to garner its first victory as it
travels to Florida this week-
end. The Wolverines will play
a three-game series against
Fordham on Friday and Satur-
day before playing an exhibition
against the New York Mets on
Sunday.
"It's always fun when we can
play the Mets," Biondi said. "We
appreciate the opportunity and
are looking forward to a good
weekend of baseball."
The slow start to their season
has not dampened expectations
for the Wolverines this upcom-
ing weekend.
"I expect we play better than
last weekend," Bakich said.
"I expect that our program
and team is going to be bet-
ter. We expect to win, just like
we expected to win on opening
weekend."
Michigan will continue to
field a very young roster with
six underclassmen in the start-
ing lineup, a fact not lost on the
coaching staff.
"We are going to continue to
get better," Bakich said. "We
have some inexperience out
there and the more our team
plays, the better we'll get."
For Bakich and the rest of the
Wolverines, though, the empha-
sis for this upcoming weekend
will be getting victories - the
real kind, not the moral ones.

consecutive

Wallace has thrown five com-
plete games of the six contests
that she's started, and the fresh-
man has allowed a total of just
three earned runs this season.
Michigan will likely counter
in the circle with sophomore
pitcher Sara Driesenga, who has
performed admirably while fill-
ing in for sophomore ace Haylie

Wagner. The right-handed pitch-
er has already won seven games
in the young season and is con-
tributing from the plate as well
with a .412 batting average.
After winning Big Ten Pitch-
er of the Year in 2012, Wagner
hasn't appeared in a game this
season for undisclosed rea-
sons, and Michigan coach Carol
Hutchins said that "we don't
really like to talk about injuries."
Hutchins doesn't expect Wagner
to play this weekend.
With doubleheaders on con-
secutive days in the Clearwater,
Fla. heat, the Wolverines' relief
pitchers will be called upon
more often this weekend. Both
freshman Alice Fitzpatrick and
senior Stephanie Speierman
have pitched sparingly this sea-
son, due in part to Driesenga's
success.
"We're going to worry about
the first game," Hutchins said.
"Obviously, if we can get our
other pitchers in, I think both
(Speierman) and Alice need to be
ready to help us win."
After the opening game Fri-
day against Louisiana-Lafayette,
Michigan will have just a few
minutes to regroup before it
faces Illinois State (5-5). Though
the Redbirds' pitchinghas strug-
gled this season, their offensive
firepower will test the Wolver-
ines. In its five victories this sea-
son, Illinois State has scored 37
runs, led by catcher Elizabeth
Kay's .387 batting average and
three home runs.
Saturday afternoon, the Wol-

verines will play UC Davis (5-5)
and Hofstra (2-3) before clos-
ing out the tournament Sunday
against DePaul (4-6). After start-
ing the season with four wins in
five contests, the Blue Demons
have dropped five consecutive
games.
Tournaments like the NFCA
Leadoff Classic put an extra
burden on coaches, as they are
tasked with preparing for five
different opponents instead of a
series against the same team. But
Hutchins said that she's gotten
used to the challenge.
"The five games is part of the
journey," she said. "We practice
good habit. We're just trying to
get better every day."
The short practice weeks have
made it difficult for Michigan to
find a suitable replacement for
recently graduated first baseman
and two-time Big Ten Player
of the Year Amanda Chidester.
Last weekend, the Wolverines
combined for six errors at the
position, contributing heavily to
the team's loss to then-winless
LIU Brooklyn. Junior Caitlin
Blanchard - a catcher - made
her first career start at first base
during the FAU Classic, and
performed well enough to earn
additional practice time at the
position this week.
"I put (Blanchard) over (at
first) the last couple of days to
give her some practice reps,"
Hutchins said. "The competition
is on. We're trying to find who is
going to play first base for us. The
spot is still open."

Two stretches total
36 unanswered
points for Nebraska
to topple Michigan
By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
In a clash of the Big Ten's hot-
test teams, the Michigan wom-
en's basketball team came out
fast against No. 24 Nebraska. In
the first half, at least.
The Wolverines - riding a
three-game win streak, includ-
ing a huge

State on
Saturday - forced three Corn-
husker turnovers in the opening
two minutes and relied on the
strong play of senior forward Nya
Jordan, who had six of the team's
first 10 points. But two extensive
stretches without a basket -
Nebraska had runs of 15 and 21
unanswered points - were too
much for Michigan to overcome
in a 57-39 loss to Nebraska on
Thursday night. Michigan scored
its lowest point total of the sea-
son in its second-to-last home
game.
"It was just one of those nights
where we couldn't get out of it,"
said Michigan coach Kim Barnes

Jordan ended the game with
12 points and a career-high 16

career best. Sheffer added nine
points and seven rebounds.
The downfall for the Wolver-
ines was their second-half per-
formance - they were outscored
39-17 in the period. Michigan
shot 27.7 percent on the game,

shot 39.6 percent on the game

second half In addition, the
Cornhuskers went 7-for-12 from
downtown in the second half.
"The second half we came out
dead," Sheffer said. "We didn't
have any energy. The biggest
thing was that we weren't hitting
shots, but we were going on the
defensive shots and letting them
hit shots. When we're not hit-
ting shots we have to step up our
defensive game especially."
Added Barnes Arico: "In the
second half I really thought that
we looked fatigued, (and) they
really beat us in transition. We
lost our fire a little bit, and I think
sometimes not being able to score
takes the wind out of your sails,
and (that's) what happened to
us."

The game of basketball boils
down to two fundamentals -
making baskets and playing
defense. On Thursday, the Mich-
igan women's basketball team
failed in both areas, leading to
a 57-39 rout by No. 24 Nebraska.
Both the Wolverines and
Cornhuskers struggled to find a
rhythm on offense, exchanging
leads throughout the first half.
Michigan started the game in a
man-to-man defense, containing
Nebraska's leading scorer, junior
guard Jordan Hooper, to two
points at the break. The Husk-
ers allowed a 10-2 run out of
the gates, but tightened up their
defense to let only senior guard
Nya Jordan score in double dig-
its with 10 points in the first half.
Nebraska shot a paltry 25.9
percent from the field in the first
half, but Michigan wasn't much
better at 32.4 percent. Still, the
Wolverines took advantage of a
struggling Husker team to take a
slim lead at the break, 22-18.
The second half was a differ-
ent story. As Michigan sank into
a 2-3 zone, Nebraska went on a
21-0 run while the Wolverines'
offense seemed to vanish. With-
in an instant, a game that Michi-
gan seemed to control became
too much to handle.
"The second half we came out
dead - we didn't have any ener-
gy," said senior forward Rachel
Sheffer. "The biggest thing was
that we weren'thittingshots,but
we were going on the defensive
end and letting them hit shots.
When we're not hitting shots,
we have to step up our defensive
game especially."
The Wolverines couldn't find
an answer for Huskers' senior
guard Lindsey Moore, who fin-
ished the game with 15 points
and eight assists. Moore not
only controlled her team's tempo
on offense, but she also locked
down Michigan senior guard
Jenny Ryan on defense. Ryan,
who earned this week's Big Ten
Player of the Week Honors, fol-
lowed up a career-high 24 points
against Michigan State with just
six points against Nebraska.
"I thought tonight Nebraska
did agreat job of wearing(Jenny)
out and they guarded her," said
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico. "She played 39 minutes,
so I mean they exhausted her
and did a tremendous job on her
defensively, and she seemed a
little bit tired."
The leading scorer for the
Wolverines this season, senior
guard Kate Thompson, shot an
abysmal 2-for-17 from the field
and finished with five points.
Thompson was guarded tightly
off of screens, and while she saw

a fair share of opportunities, she
was never able to find a rhythm,
shooting a mere 10 percent
from behind the arc. The Husk-
ers effectively double-teamed
Thompson to contain her dan-
gerous 3-point shot, forcing
Michigan's offense to find the
open player.
"They left the people coming
off the bench wide open, and I
think we were kind of shocked
by that," Sheffer said. "We
weren't really sure what to do.
We had wide-open looks but we
just didn't knock them down."
While the Wolverines con-
tinued to allow Nebraska to
shoot through their zone, no
one stepped up for Michigan on
offense. Several times in the sec-
ond half, the Huskers doubled
Thompson and Sheffer, leaving
sophomore guard Nicole Elm-
blad wide open. Elmblad, who
isn't known for her offensive
abilities, missed all three of her
attempts shooting.
"For a lot of us, we were never
wide open in the season," Jordan
said. "I think for the most part
we had to think what we wanted
to do and that took us out of our
routine and rhythm."
Senior guard Sam Arnold
came off the bench in an attempt-
ed relief role, but the Wolverines
couldn't handle the pressure.
Michigan found itself constantly
battling the shot clock as Ryan
continued to force the ball to
Thompson and Sheffer.
"Obviously they did a great
job of doubling our other kids
and getting kids open," Barnes
Arico said. "We need some other
kids to come in and make some
plays for us in order for us to be
successful."
This isn't the firstsighting of a
stagnant Wolverines offense. In
its first game against Michigan
State in East Lansing, Michigan
struggled to find a rhythm in the
second half and settled for last-
second shots. The Wolverines'
panic on Thursday resembled
the offensive production that
contributed to their four-game
conference skid.
But if there is anything Michi-
gan has learned fromits mid-sea-
son slide, it's how to bounce back
against tough teams. After losing
four out of five games in the Big
Ten, the Wolverines responded
by defeating three consecutive
top-tier Big Ten teams. Michi-
gan now has the opportunity to
make a monumental rebound on
Sunday at No. 8 Penn State and
prove that Thursday's game was
simply a hiccup.
"We've been in this position
before - ina little slump," Sheffer
said."Itwas just abadnighttoplay
basketball for us. We just need to
make sure tomorrow we come in
and get ready for Penn State."

After welcomed rest, 'M' faces streaking Illini

Struggling bigs
should receive
boost from a
recovering Morgan

The last time the Michigan
men's basketball team held an
opponent's

less than 10
points was Michigan

just six points
in a convinc-
ing 74-60 road win, but ever
since, the Wolverines haven't
been able to stop the opponents'
interior game, especially with
the absence of redshirt junior

forward Jordan Morgan due to
a persistent ankle injury - their
defensive rock.
Thankfully for Michigan (9-4
Big Ten, 22-4 overall), it hosts
the Fighting Illini (6-7, 19-8) on
Sunday with Morgan's health
improving. The redshirt junior
started in the seventh-ranked
Wolverines' latest contest
against Penn State, and with him
continuing to show improve-
ment combined with Illinois'
weak frontcourt coming to Ann
Arbor, Michigan will be able to
focus its defense on the perim-
eter.
But it won't be an easy task to
defend one ofthe best backcourts
in the Big Ten. Seniors Brandon
Paul and D.J. Richardson and
sophomore Tracy Abrams com-
bine for 40 points per game - 56
percent of the Fighting Illini's
offense - while Paul is fourth in
the conference in scoring, aver-
aging 16.4 points per game.
Though Paul didn't have as
explosive of a game against
Northwestern on Feb. 17 as
he's capable of - he scored just
eight points - Illinois coach
John Groce has seen immense

improvement in the captain's
all-around game and hopes he'll
continue the trend.
"I thought (Sunday's game)
was as good a performance as
he's had all year in all areas,"
said Groce in a teleconference on
Monday. "He rebounded the ball
well, I thought his shot selec-
tion was excellent, he shared
the ball, he made our team bet-
ter. He (also) defended well, he
made a couple of hustle, extra-
effort plays. I thought he played
as well-rounded a game as he has
all year, I think his mind is in the
right place."
And Paul's improvement has
contributed to the Fighting Illi-
ni's five-game win streak. After
struggling early in the confer-
ence slate - going 2-7 in the
first nine games of Big Ten play
- Illinois responded with upsets
over Indiana and Minnesota and
thrashings of Purdue and North-
western.
But while Illinois has been on
a late-season surge, Michigan
has been faltering. After drop-
ping three of their four games in
a 10-day stretch, the Wolverines
struggled to fend off Penn State

last Sunday, which is winless in
the Big Ten.
Michigan has recently shown
signs of the wear associated with
the brutal conference sched-
ule, and the tough stretch has
exposed several weaknesses in
the Wolverines' game, especial-
ly on defense. Michigan coach
John Beilein recognized his
team's exhaustion and adjusted
this week's practice schedule
accordingly, though he's still
adamant that the squad will con-
tinue to improve with the right
regiment.
"It takes a long process (to
adjust physically), and that's
just being in the weight room,"
Beilein said in a teleconference
on Monday. "We find that the
more you're in the weight room,
the more that you're work-
ing out, the stronger you get. It
doesn't hurt to be tough (and) it
doesn't hurt to be physical.
"(There's also) your whole
attitude in practice, about what
you're going to stand for. There's
just all kind of motivating ways
you'll do to make sure they
understand it is urgent that you
play at a higher level, you play

really hard, and you play smart
- that's the toughest thing to do.
There's a lot of ways (of motiva-
tion), whether it's extra running,
raise your voice, (or) make prac-
tice go longer."
And while sophomore guard
Trey Burke and junior guard
Tim Hardaway Jr. have had no
trouble handling the physicality
of conference play, the freshmen
- most notably guard Nik Staus-
kas and forward Glenn Robinson
III - have struggled greatly dur-
ing the Big Ten slate.
Though the offense was hot
for Michigan with Robinson and
Stauskas having breakout games
against the Nittany Lions offen-
sively, the whole team's defense
lacked motivation. Beilein is
hoping that the week off will
allow the team to focus indi-
vidually in auldition to the team's
larger needs.
"Instead of having 15 guys at
practice, we may have several
sessions with five guys for an
hour ... and then have an hour
practice," Beilein said. "There's
some different things we can do
to give individual attention to
the strengths and weaknesses

we have individually."
Even without a stellar defen-
sive performance, chances are
Michigan will be able to scrap
a win against Illinois behind
Burke and Hardaway's continu-
ing tear. But if the Wolverines
hope to compete against the
Big Ten's best - they still have
remaining games against Michi-
gan State and Indiana - they will
need a big difference on defense.
