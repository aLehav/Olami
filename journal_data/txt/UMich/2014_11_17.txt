WINTER COMMENCEMENT
- Head of
NASA to
address
graduates

Charles F. Bolden,
former astronaut,
worked with 'U' to
promote sciences
By CLAIRE BRYAN
DailyStaff Reporter
This year's Winter Com-
mencement speaker is a man
who names both fictional
astronaut Buck Rogers and
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as
inspirations.
NASA Administrator
Charles F. Bolden, Jr. will be
the commencement's honorary
guest speaker, the University
announced early Monday.
The commencement cer-
emony will take place at 2 p.m.
on Sun., Dec. 14 at the Crisler
Center.
Under Bolden's leadership,
NASA has launched a space-
craft to Jupiter, landed a Mars
rover and enhanced Earth-
observingsatellites. NASA aims
to create U.S. vehicles to travel

to the International Space Sta
tion by 2017 and launch the
James Webh Space Telescope,
which has been created to suc-
ceed the Hubble Space Tele-
scope, by 2018.
President Barack Obama's
tenure has seen a fundamental
reorientation of NASA. Bolden
increased public-private part-
nerships during a time of major
budget cuts to NASA.
Bolden is the first Black
administrator of NASA.
Bolden is a veteran of four
spaceflights, two of which he
commanded. In 1990, he com-
manded Space Shuttle Discov-
ery and its deployment of the
Hubble Space Telescope, and
in 1994 he commanded the first
joint U.S. and Russian Space
Shuttle mission.
Born in Columbia, S.C.,
Bolden was captivated by the
adventures of fiction hero Buck
Rogers as a child.'
He graduated from the Unit-
ed States Naval Academy in
1968 with abachelor's degree in
electrical science. After gradu-

By EMMA KINERY
Daily StaffReporter
Students and Ann Arbor resi-
dents banded together with local
nonprofit organizations this
weekend to discover ways to

better interpret and use institu-
tional data in A2 Data Dive, an
annual community event.
Four nonprofits - SafeHouse
Center, Summer in the City,

The data provided was anony-
mous on an individual level. Data
Dive featured 102 volunteer pro-
grammers, consisting mostly of
graduate students in the School

of Information.
Jackie Cohen, A2 Data Dive
coordinator, said the emphasis
for the event this year - the
third time it has been held in
Ann Arbor- was to encourage
skill-sharing between partici-
pants. The event was founded'

The University's Board of Regents
voted against creating a non-voting
studentseatontheboard and against
endorsing student involvement in
other parts of the University's poli-
cymakingprocess.
In a short statement, Regent
David Laro (R), characterized
the idea of a non-voting student
member as "inappropriate."
Regent Robert Nederlander
(D) also read a resolution from
the board that said they were
unwilling to order other Univer-
sity entities to include students.
The two proposals originat-
ed from recommendations of
the Commission to Study Stu-

dent Governance, set up by the
Regentstwo years prior.

The Committee on the Eco-

announced University faculty
salaries trailed behind those at
peer institutions.
The announcement came as
part of the committee's annu-
al report to the faculty Senate
Assembly. In previous reports,
the CESF had suggested contin-
ued salary increases as an effort
to establish parity. Economics,
Prof. John Cross said salaries had
increased, but not to the point of
parity with other schools.

The Board of Regents criti-

seven-year licensing deal with
Nike and ordered University Sec-
retary Harold Johnson to provide
them with a summary of all the
policiesinvolved inthe contract.
"It struck me that it has pro-
found implications on how we
project ourselves to the world,"
said Regent Laurence Deitch (D).
"I submit that there are some
things that are important such as
whether or not we let a shoe com-
pany piggyback on 170 years of
tradition to peddle some shoes."

Cirdle K hosts annual

'Service Day'
inspires student
outreach around
campus, Ann Arbor
By THERESE BREUCH
For the Daily
The football team had a bye
week this weekend, but students
found a pretty good substitute
for their time in the student sec-
tion.
In a span of 24 hours; stu-
dents completed 118 commu-
nity service projects in a span of
24 hours Saturday for the 10th
annual Circle K Service Day.
Circle K International is a
co-ed service organization spon-
sored by the nonprofit Kiwanis
International. Their mission is
to cultivate college students into
responsible citizens with a com-
mitment to service.

The University's chapter's
Circle K Service Day is its larg-
est event of the year. This year's
event was carnival-themed,
and the Ginsberg Center, which
served as a headquarters for the
event, was decorated with red
and white streamers, handmade
posters, colored flags and a pop-
corn machine.
Circle K President AshleyAus-
tin, a Business senior, said people
come for as many or as few proj-
ects as they want to participate
in throughout the day.
"The idea of it is just to expose
all of U of M students to commu-
nity service and show how much
of an impact can be made in one
day," Austin said.
LSA junior Taylor Sullivan,
Circle K charity awareness chair,
said the organization is hopingto
fundraise over $2,000 this year
for The Eliminate Project, which
aims to eliminate maternal and
neonatal tetanus, a potentially
fatal condition that results from

soil spores coming into contact
with exposed cuts or abrasions
during childbirth.
The main fundraiser of the
event consisted of throwing a
whipped cream pie at five mem-
bers of the leadership team at
midnight. Anyone who came
through the Ginsberg Center
during the event could donate
money designated to a member
of the leadership team. The five
members who received the most
donations were pied in the face.
In addition to Circle K Service
Day, the organization completes
three to four community service
projects each day throughout the
year and focuses on leadership
development and friendship.
"It's really amazing how you
can get together with a commu-
nity of people who are interested
in the same thing as you are,"
Sullivan said. "We have a little
token phrase, but it's really true.
People come for the service and
stay for the friendship."

CLARK
From Page 1A
in Sandusky, Ohio. Clark alleg-
edly punched his girlfriend in the
face, and she fell into and broke a
hotel lamp. The victim said Clark
pinned her to the bed, according
to the Register's report.
The victim's brother was alleg-
edly in the vicinity of the incident
and told police he saw Clark grab
her by the neck and slam her to
the ground.
A person staying in a neigh-
boring hotel room called hotel
employees to inform them of
the incident, describing it as
"sound(ing) like a head was being
bounced off the wall."
The police were called at about
10:30 p.m. to respond to an inci-
dent involving a woman passed
out inside a hotel room. According
to the report, Clark had left the
hotel room and was approached
by an officer when he arrived at
the scene.
CONFERENCE
From Page 1A
ference had been underway for
many months.
English Prof. Anne Curzan,
the University's faculty athlet-
ics representative to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
and Big Ten conference, played a
major part in bringing such a con-
ference to the University. Curzan
also works as one of the leaders of
LSA's Theme Semester "Sport and
the University."
Her role as facultyliaison to the
University Athletic Department
was a major topic of conversation
at last Monday's SACUA meeting,
in which Schlissel stated that the
department "often tries to keep
her at arm's length." In his inter-
view with the Daily, Schlissel said
his comments were an overstate-
ment and clarified that Curzan
has full access to student-athletes.
Curzan approached Compara-
tive Literature Prof. Yago Colas
last year to discuss the pos-
sible production of a conference
to assess the values of sport to
national universities.
Based on his experience study-
* ing and writing about the culture
of sports, Colas was a logical can-
didate to organize the conference.
He has traditionally taught a sem-
inar-style class at the University
each winter titled The Cultures
of Basketball, which is popular
among athletes and non-athletes
alike.
Colas said he supported Schlis-
sel's statements regarding Uni-
versity athletics, adding that he
feels the negative reactions to the
statement detracted from Schlis-
sel's larger goal of improving the
department's connection to the
University.
"I appreciate that he is thinking
critically about sports at Michi-
gan and seems to have a will to
try to make sure that we have our
sports programs serve the educa-
tional mission of the University -
I share that goal with him," Colas
said. "I think - probably out of
inexperience, perhaps, or a lack of
familiarity with the culture here
- he kind of painted too broad a
brush, and was overly general.
"Unfortunately I think that
has created a kind of backlash of

criticism which has caused the
impulse behind his remarks to be
overlooked," he added.
Colas said he envisioned the
conference as an interdisciplin-
ary discussion. For that reason,
he saw it as only logical to ask two
professors from two very differ-
ent disciplines to help co-host the
event with him.
"What is particularly of inter-
est to me was to bring together
humanists and social scientists,"
said Comparative Literature Prof.
Silke-Maria Weineck, a confer-
ence co-organizer. "So just the
fact that this is co-sponsored by

Clark allegedly told the offi-
cer, "I didn't do s--- to her. I
didn't touch that woman. She is a
woman."
He added, "I don't know what
they do, what they go through,
I don't know what she's going
through. I know she is going
through some crazy fits, and she
may be pregnant."
According tothe Register, Clark
had a bloody nose and remained
silent throughout followup ques-
tions. The victim did not want to
pursue charges against Clark.
Prior to the Register's report,
Michigan football coach Brady
Hoke released the following
statement: "We are aware of the
report involving Frank Clark. I
have not spoken with Frank but
will at the appropriate time. We
will respect the legal process and
make any decisions once we have
the facts."
The Athletic Department did
not immediately respond to a
request for further comment.
the College of Literature, Science
and the Arts and the School of
Kinesiology, I think is a huge suc-
cess right in itself."
Throughout the conference,
there were no direct suggestions
that intercollegiate sports should
be eliminated, but within each
panel, concerns were raised as to
whether sports are being incor-
porated in the most efficient way.
However, the conference was not
designed to think of solutions, but
rather to foster thoughtful dis-
cussions.
A Saturday panel focusing on
education featured Colas along
with former Michigan basketball
player Jimmy King, a member of
the "Fab Five," and Psychology
Prof. Robert Sellers. A question
and answer segment followed the
panel.
While Colas discussed his
experience teaching about the
topic of sports, King reflected on
his time at the University as a stu-
dent-athlete.
Colas noted that at the begin-
ning of his course it is impossible
to ignore the divide between ath-
letes and non-athletes.
"The students who are not
basketball players, including
many who are athletes in other
sports, appear starstruk to vary-
ing degrees," Colas said. "Unlike
those athletes from other sports,
the basketball players seem shy
and almost suspicious, or at least
cautious... Perhapsatheyare aware
of their status in the eyes of other
students; aware, I mean, that they
are, on our campus anyway, pub-
lic figures who must weigh their
words and actions carefully."
"Perhaps they have internal-
ized, or at least sensitized, to the
common public view that they
are somehow not 'real' students,"
Colas added. "All in all, that first
day feels tense to me, fraught with
division and a kind of defensive
mutual wariness, that strikes me
as emblematic, if not symptom-
atic of the strain that our model
of intercollegiate athletics, and
the social values it expresses, can
place on education."
As the course progressed,
Colas said he was thrilled with
the apparent decline in divisions
between students based on their
status at the University.

King is no stranger to this dis-
connect that Colas described.
Reflecting on his time on campus,
he believes that it is the Univer-
sity's responsibility to break away
from the barriers that have been
passed down for generations.
"There is no one person in the
classroom that is superior to the
other when it comes to recogni-
tion of being a basketball player
or football player or any kind of
athlete," King said. "When we
recognize that, and we acknowl-
edge that, and we truly operate
from that mindset, we will be
better off as a community as a
whole."

DATA
From Page 1A
inspired to create the event after
Roda attended an event in New
York hosted by DataKind, a New
York-based nonprofit that has
inspired similar events at col-
leges across the country.
"We've really shifted the focus
a lot towards education and stu-
dents teaching one another and
sharing data manipulation skills,
instead of focusing mostly on
what DataKind does, which is
bringing data analysis service
to organizations that need it,"
Cohen said. "We do that too, but
we're focused on education."
At the event, participantswere
separated into four rooms, each

of which corresponded to one
of the participating nonprofits.
Maintaining a focus on educa-
tion, one room was also specifi-
cally designated for participants
with little to no experience with
formatting data. They were guid-
ed by more experienced partici-
pants.
Information graduate student
Hannah Brookhart, who partici-
pated in the education session,
said she appreciated the career
experience the event provided.
"I'm really interested in
archiving data," she said. "I'm
at the School of Information to
become an archivist so I thought
that this would be agreat place to
learn how to manipulate data and
also analyze it. It was really great
actually; I did things that I didn't

think that I could do."
Students with previous pro-
gramming experience also said
they felt they gained experience
from the event. Information
graduate student Madeleine Fil-
loux, who worked with 826mich-
igan during the event, said she
saw A2 Data Dive as a good
opportunity to work with real
data from organizations.
"In class we do projects, but
it's a whole other thing to deal
with data that companies have
actually been collecting because
it might be less well formatted or
more messy," she said. "It's kind
of the real side of data that you
don't always see in class."
Meanwhile, representatives
from the nonprofits involved in
the event said they appreciated

that they were able to help stu-
dents gain experience while also
having their data analyzed.
This was Ozone House's sec-
ond year at A2 Data Dive, and
Allie Schachter, the organiza-
tion's grants and evaluation
director, said they will partici-
pate again.
"[Data Dive] helps us sort of be
able to better show our impact
by building these visualizations
for us that we don't have the
familiarity with, the software
in-house to do," Schachter said.
"It's great data, which we love
to share with the community to
show, you know, representing
issues of young people we see in
the community and who's calling
us, and the ongoing needs of the
youth."


MAYOR
From Page 1A
my time as mayor was length-
ened by the recession," Hieftje
said. "I wanted to make sure the
city got through the recession,
and I also wanted to be there to
make sure our new city admin-
istrator Steve Powers got off to a
good solid start."
Hieftje said though he ran for
mayor with significant environ-
mental goals, he was met with

unexpected realities during
his time serving as mayor. And
although his hopes for the city's
future are high, he cautions
councilmembers and Taylor to
make adequate preparations for
the worst.
"I learned that you've got to
follow through with the environ-
mental stuff, and I have and the
city has, but you also need to be
prepared for hard times econom-
ically, and I think that was the
lesson of the 2000s," Hieftje said.
"The city has to remain prepared

for hard times economically."
Early in his time as mayor,
Hieftje focused on reducing the
size of the city's bureaucracy -
a decision he said he has been
grateful for in recent years. Hief-
tje said following the recession,
Ann Arbor lost its largest single
taxpayer when the University
took over what was once the Pfiz-
er property near North Campus.
He added that with the rising
costs of health care, looking for
ways to save money and have a
balanced budget is key for the

success of the city
Hieftje said he will be seek-
ing environmental projects in
the coming year, doing consult-
ing work and teaching a course
on local governments at the Ford
School of Public Policy.
"Students who are interested
in getting into politics at any level
should recognize the fact that alot
of people who are in politics got
their start in local government,"
Hieftje said. "I believe people can
influence the government much
more atthe local level."

ating, he was commissioned as a
second lieutenant in the Marine
Corps, where he flew more than
100 combat missions in Southeast
Asia during the Vietnam War.
Bolden returned to the United
States and earned his master's
degree in systems management
from the University of Southern
California in 1977.
He joined NASA in 1980 where
his many roles have included
technical assistant to the direc-
tor of Flight Crew Operations,
lead astronaut for vehicle test
and checkout, chief of the Safety
Division at Johnson Space Center
and assistant deputy administra-
tor.
In 1994, Bolden returned t
active duty with the Marine
Corps. He served as deputy
commandant of midshipmen at
the Naval Academy and then as
deputy commander of the United
States Forces Japan, among other
leadership positions.
In their communication to the
regents recommending Bolden,
the Committee on Honorary
Degrees highlighted his passion
for ameliorating disparities in
education, heath, employment
and income.
In 2003, Bolden filed amicus
curiae briefs supporting the Uni-
versity's affirmative action policy
during the contentious lawsuits
Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v.
Bollinger.
Bolden worked with Univer-
sity President Emeritus James
Duderstadt and the late MIT
President Emeritus Chuck Vest
on diversity initiatives through-
out the 1980s and 1990s. Bolden
also helped in engaging Univer-
sity engineering and science ini-
tiatives to attract more minority
studentsto careersinthese fields.
"You have been an exemplar of

leadership and courage through-
out your illustrious career as a
public servant," the committee
wrote. "You also are admired and
respected for your unwavering
support of diversity, social justice
and programs that encourage
students to study science, tech-
nology, engineering and math-
ematics."
At the Winter Commence-
ment, Bolden and three others
will receive honorary degrees
from the University. Bolden will
earn a Doctor of Science honor-
ary degree, joined by atmospher-
ic scientist Ralph J. Cicerone and
geneticist Hamilton O. Smith.
Susanne Baer, a judge in Germa-
ny's highest court, will earn the
Doctor of Laws honorary degree.
Susanne Baer
The recipient of the Doctor of
Laws honorary degree is a judge
in the gderk Constitutional
Court of Germany and a pro-
fessor of public law and gender
studies at Humboldt University
of Berlin. Baer earned her Master
of Laws degree at the University.
At Humboldt, Baer directs the
Law and Society Institute Berlin
and co-founded its Center for
Transdisciplinary Gender Stud-
ies. She served as the law facul-
ty's dean of academic affairs and
vice president for academic and
international affairs. She also co-
directs the Law in Context proj-
ect at the Institute for Advanced
Study in Berlin.
Baer works to advance femi-
nist legal theory through her
teaching and writing. Publish-
ing in both English and German,
she proposed allowing women's
groups to file suit against por-
nography that depicts degrad-
ing subordination of women and
men.
The Federal Constitutional
Court hears all cases brought
to it by individuals who believe
their rights have been violated

under the German Constitution.
The German Parliament elected
Judge Baer to a 12-year term in
2011. She is one of five women on
the 16-member court and the first
openly gay member.
She has created opportunities
for University of Michigan Law
School graduates to clerk at the
Federal Constitutional Court of
Germany.
Ralph J. Cicerone
The Committee on Honorary
Degrees will award a Doctor of
Science to Cicerone, president
of the National Academy of Sci-
ences and one of the world's fore-
most atmospheric scientists.
Cicerone often testifies before
Congress and advises the White
House on issues such as green-
house gases and ozone depletion.
He served, as a researcher
in ck etc eyineering at the
University fron1970 to 1978. In
2007, the University established
the Ralph J. Cicerone Distin-
guished UniversityProfessorship
of Atmospheric Science in his
honor.
He spent much of his career
at the University of California,
Irvine. There, he founded the
Department of Earth System Sci-
ence and served as dean of UC
Irvine's School of Physical Sci-
ences from 1994 to 1998 and as
chancellor from 1998 to 2005.
In 2001, Cicerone led a climate
study at the National Academy of
Sciences confirming the role of
human activities in global warm-
ing. He was elected NAS presi-
dent and chair of the National
Research Council in 2005.
Cicerone is a trustee of the
Carnegie Corporation of New
York and was president of the
American Geophysical Union.

Hamilton O. Smith
Smith, a Nobel laureate, will be
the third recipient of the Univer-
sity's Doctor of Science award.
Smith and his colleagues
received the Nobel Prize in
1978 for discovering restriction
enzymes and their application to
problems of molecular genetics.
Currently, he researches genom-
ics at the J. Craig Venter Institute
and is an adjunct professor at
the University of California, San
Diego School of Medicine.
Smith was born in New York
City, received a bachelor's degree
in mathematics from the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley
and an M.D. from Johns Hop-
kins University. He served two
years in the Navy and completed
his medical residency at Henry
Ford Hospital in Detroit. In
1962, Smith began research as a
postdoctoral fellow at the Uni-
versity's Department ,f Human
Genetics.
Apart from his Nobel-winning
research, Smith has made many
important discoveries in the field
of genetics. He found one of the
first types of restriction enzymes,
worked on gene arrangement
and sequence and was part of
the team that sequenced the first
genome of a self-replicating, free-
living organism - the Haemoph-
ilus influenzae bacterium.
In 2002, Smith became the
Venter Institute's scientific
director of synthetic biology and
bioenergy. In 2010, the institute
created the first bacterial cell
running entirely from a chemi-
cally synthesized genome.
Smith was inducted into
University's Medical Center
Alumni Society Hall of Honor
in 2006.

STUDENT ATHLETE ADVISORY COMMITTEE'VIEWPOINT
Student-athletes want to be heard

The battle over blood

To Whom It May Concern:
We are Michigan student-athletes. Among
the recent controversy regarding Michigan
Athletics, our voices have been left out. It'stime
for us to be heard.
We believe that recent coverage of
Michigan Athletics has been largely one-sided.
Understand that media coverage and decisions
made about Michigan Athletics intimately
affect our lives. We have been insulted and
discredited not only as student-athletes, but as
people. Outofrespecttoouruniversity,wehave
stayed silent for weeks; now, we feel the need to
speak up.
We appreciate the discourse among
stakeholders in Michigan Athletics: alumni,
students, administrators and the community
we serve. We have no problem with people
expressing opinions of the administration
that, in large part, governs our experience as
student-athletes. What we do have a problem
with is those outside of our 900-plus-strong
communityattempting to speak for us.
The balance that student-athletes maintain
between academics and athletics is under
intense scrutiny. One example of many
appeared last week in University President
Mark Schlissel's comments regarding student-
athlete academic eligibility and performance.
"We admit students who aren't as qualified,
and it's probably the kids that we admit that
can't honestly, even with lots of help, do the
amount of work and the quality of work it takes
to make progression from year to year."
Let us be clear: this is just one example of a
misunderstanding that has left us feeling disap-
pointed and frustrated. We have acknowledged
President Schlissel's apology, but maintain that
his comments are not only hurtful, but indica-
tive of a larger problem on campus.
Public perception of student-athletes is too
easily swayed by the media and deafening
public opinion.Our objectiveintlhe nearfuture
is to takeback thegutonomy of our image. We

are here for an education; there is nothing
less that is expected of us simply because we
are student-athletes, and we hold ourselves
to the same standard as every other student
on campus.
The discourse of prior weeks, asshortsighted
as it is, comes from a history much deeper than
the events of this fall. A history where it is OK to
dismiss student-athletes as dumb, unmotivated
and one-dimensional simply because of the
time they spend outside of school. Stereotyping
diminishes not only its perpetrators and its
victims, but the entire campus community that
should value diversity and compassion over
judgment and spite.
We consider it the ultimate honor to wear
the block 'M' , and this is a unifying value
throughout campus. The block 'M' unites us
all - students and musicians and engineers
and actors and activists and researchers and
student-athletes. It's a privilege to share this
tradition, one that we believe is the best in the
world. We appreciate all contributions to make
Michigan the Leaders and Best and hope our
contributions are valued as well.
In President Schlissel's inaugural address,
he implored us to agree on three central tenets,
the third of which stated that "as members
of this community, we will always seek out,
encourage, and value all voices." In these times
of turbulence, we turn to you, no matter how
you wear the block 'M' . We are asking for
our unique voice to be received with curiosity
instead of judgment; and we promise that to
yours, we will do the same.

After reading a previous
column of mine in which I
questioned the legitimacy
of the FDA's
continued ban
on men who have
sex with men
(MSM) from
donating blood,
the University's
Blood Drives
United, a student-
run organization AUSTIN
sponsored by the DAVIS
Alpha Phi Omega
co-ed national
service fraternity, contacted me
about it. The group's members
urged me to meet with them so
that they could receive some
feedback from a queer student on
the different projects they've begun
in an attempt to bring student
awareness to the policy.
The FDA's 1983 implementation of
the ban barring MSM from donating
blood was, at the time, a step made in
response to a real and palpable fear:
due to technological constraints
that limited the extent to which
HIV antibodies could be detected
in donated blood, healthy patients
of blood transfusions stood a
chance of inadvertently contracting
HIV from infected blood without
physicians ever knowing. Banning
the population with the highest
occurrence of HIV seemed - and
admittedly was - an acceptable and
logical action in an attempt to halt
further dissemination of the virus.
Thirty years later, however, a ban
that was made to protect the public
could be one that potentially kills
it. The Red Cross reports that it
continues to be about 40,000 units
of blood behind daily quotas, a hefty
number that could be significantly
diminished if MSM were allowed
to donate along with the rest of the
population. Because of this, simply
not having access to blood seems
much more potentially harmful
than the one in 6.5 million chance
that a healthy donor could receive
infected blood; current medical
technology can detect the HIV
antibodies as early as nine days
after infection, and blood from
every donor is readily screened
before being deemed viable for use.
Before meeting with LSA
senior Samantha Rea and others

on BDU's executive board, I held
negative views on the initiatives
the organization had put in place
in order to educate others about
the ban. BDU had begun a series
of awareness meetings, had
conceptualized and implemented
the creation of a visual arts project
to display the number of potential
lives that could be saved from MSM
blood, and had even attempted to
pass a White House petition to
effectively ;nd the ban. This, in my
mind,wasn'tenough;althoughthese
projects were all well-intended
gestures made in support of the
gay and bisexual male community,
they failed to cause any sort of far-
reaching splash that would initiate
political action. If they're taking on
this issue, I'd thought, they should
be critically examining the ban by
attempting to forge some catalyst
for change, instead of merely
implementing peacekeeping efforts
meant to pacify the critical gay and
bisexual male student body.
My accusations of inaction,
however, were made unjustly; as
it turns out, they have been work-
ing tirelessly to try to find ways to
combat the ban

bureaucratic constraints as reasons
for remaining detached from any
political action in which BDU hopes
to become involved.
According to the University's
Edward Ginsberg Center for Com-
munity Service and Learning,
because of reforms to Michigan's
campaign finance laws, the Univer-
sity as a public entity is subject to
remain within certain boundaries
when becoming affiliated with politi-
cal causes; aside from conductingand
compiling research, providing fac-
tual material or holding educational
conferences about aparticular politi-
cal issue, the University is bound by
law to withhold funds in support or
dissent of a particular candidate or
political proposal.
This means that it would be ille-
gal for the University to affiliate
itself with any sort of action call-
ing for political change, including
a student petition. However, this
does not mean that the University
could not expand its role in the
issue by initiating more educational
programs and research opportuni-

heighten public contempt, then to

BENJAMIN KELLER I
A return to governing

Gridlock. That is probably the
first word that comes to many vot-
ers' minds when they think of the
current U.S. Congress. With a
Republican-controlled House, and
Democrats in control of both the
Senate and the White House, it has
been extremely difficult to pass any
type of legislation. In fact, accord-
ing to a Washington Post article,
this current Congress is on track
to pass the fewest laws ever. Why
is this? Some might say it is House
Republican obstruction of Presi-
dent Barack Obama's agenda. Oth-
ers may say it is Senate Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell's decep-
tive use of parliamentary procedure
to stymie legislation. However,
neither of these is very true at all.
Rather, it has been Harry Reid and
President Obama's fault for the
gridlock in Washington because of
their constant aversion to come to
the bargaining table and the refusal
by Mr. Reid to bring House bills
to the Senate floor. However, as a
result of the midterm election and
a massive GOP victory, Congres-
sional leadership in Washington is
about to change and the hope for
real governing will finally return to
our nation's capital.
Under Harry Reid's leadership
there has been a dwindling number
of bills brought to the Senate floor,
and virtually no chance at all for
debate or amendments. The Senate
is widely considered to be one of
the greatest deliberative bodies in
the entire world. As the bastion of
honorable debate, it is saddening
that Mr. Reid has been so reluctant
to allow bills to be deliberated.
He has done this for a variety of
reasons, which range from a refusal
to consider Republican policies to
protecting Democratic senators
from having to vote on tough

legislation that may anger their
voting populations. Unfortunately
for him, that strategy backfired.
Our country is now furious over
Congress's unwillingness to govern
and many see Mr. Reid as a symbol
of the gridlock. Furthermore those
Senators that the majority leader
was trying to protect weren't
able to make the tough votes they
needed to distance themselves from
an unpopular President. As a result,
manyofthosevulnerable Democrats
lost the midterm election because
their Republican opponents were
successfully able to tie them as
rubber stamps to the President's
failed policies.
While the GOP-led House has
passed a litany of legislation, includ-
ing many bills with bipartisan sup-
port, those bills have been hampered
in the Senate. The President and
Mr. Reid have also been extremely
reluctant to come to the table with
Republicans in an effort not to show
Democratic weakness. In response
to complaints over Washington's
inability to work together, the
President has resorted to attacking
Republicans for "extremism" and
not supporting his agenda.
With a Republican majority in
the Senate about to be sworn in,
coupled with the majority in the
House that is about to be at its
highest level in decades, the Presi-
dent will be all alone in our gov-
ernment's leadership. Obviously,
Republicans will not be able to nec-
essarily pass legislation without the
President's approval, but it will be
tough for Mr. Obama to veto bipar-
tisan legislation that has already
passed the House - a repeal of the
Medical Device Tax, lowering of
the Corporate Tax rate, reforms to
the Affordable Care Act, stronger
sanctions against Iran, approval of

the Keystone XL Pipeline and many
more acts that have been killed by
the current Senate.
With a functional Congress, we
will see numerous bills reaching
the President's desk for the
first time since the Democrats
controlled Congress in the first half
of Obama's first term. Moreover,
when Mr. McConnell takes control
of the Senate in January, there will
be actual deliberation taking part
in the chamber. Unlike Mr. Reid,
McConnell has pledged a longer
work day and week for senators,
open debate on all bills, chances
for amendments to be heard and an
overall shift in procedure from the
constant stalling that characterized
the Senate under Democratic
leadership to the free flowing of
bills through our government's
Upper House.
I want to state that I do not affili-
ate with a party. Rather, I affiliate
with a particular ideology that airs
more toward libertarianism. My
opinions in this article aren't based
on a belief in Republican Party
leadership, but a belief that our gov-
ernment should, first and foremost,
conduct its constitutionally dele-
gated powers - that means actually
enacting legislation. Just like most
people in this nation, I am fed up
with our elected representatives'
refusal to perform the jobs we sent
them to Washington for. So wheth-
er you are a Republican, Democrat,
Independent or don't affiliate with
a party like myself, all Americans
should be happy in an imminent
return to governmental normalcy,
and an end to that most hated word
that has so often characterized our
government: gridlock.

TV COLUMN
The return of
Katherine Heigi

By KATHLEEN DAVIS
Daily Arts Writer
You can break down human
nature any which way, and no
matter how you slice it, one thing
remains true:
everyone The Life
must eat, and Death
and food has
always been of Gourmet
an important Magazine
cultural
measure November 18,
through 4 to 6 p.m.
time. The
circulation Hatcher Graduate
of cookbooks Library Gallery
and culinary (Room 100)
publications
have helped to introduce new
culinary practices to many
corners of the world, with one
valuable example being Gourmet
Magazine, established in1941.
Tuesday Jan Longone, the
University's Curator of Culinary
History, will give a lecture "The
Life and Death of Gourmet,"
intended to be viewed alongside
her exhibit of the same name, in
Hatcher library. The lecture will
highlight the influence Gourmet
had on the culinary world during
its publication history, as well as
the factors leading to its downfall
in 2009.
The exhibit, which has been
open since Sept. 2 and will
continue until Dec. 1, highlights
every issue of Gourmet published
in its sexagenarian lifespan.
The exhibit also features
cookbooks written by writers and
contributors to the magazine -
many of which are rare editions
she's collected over the years.

being the latest. She made a living
as a rare book dealer until her
post at the University, focusing
substantially on cookbooks
and books centered around the
culinary arts. Over time, she's
accumulated a vast catalogue
that includes rare copies and a
few invaluable publications. One
of these showpieces is possibly
the only intact copy of a study on
French wine and olives written by
17th century English philosopher
John Locke, who's more well
known for his contributions to
Enlightenment thinking than
wine culture.
The issues and cookbooks
in the "Gourmet" exhibit are
all from Longone's personal
collection, collected over 60years
of marriage with her husband,
who is a fellow culinary fanatic.
In the exhibit, Longone wanted
to showcase the contrast between
the first issue of the magazine in
1941 and the last issue in 2009,
and thought the process of putting
the exhibit together would be
simple. However, she was once
again sucked into the magic of
the magazine and reevaluated her
approachto the exhibit.
"Every time I turned a page,
I realized, 'My God, Gourmet
taught me how to become a
culinary historian'," Longone
said. "I realized how much
influence the magazine played in
my life all along, I really couldn't
believe it."
Gourmet was a deviation
from other culinary publications
because, according to Longone,
the amount of intellectual content
alongside recipes, lifestyle advice,
puzzles and long-form reporting.
This mix of appealing content

with many famous chefs from all
over the World, highlighted how
Gourmet not only affected her
life as a young culinary historian,
but changed the lives of other
individuals in various sects of the
culinary world. She mentioned
Jeremiah Tower, Ruth Reichl
(the last Editor-in-Chief of the
publication) and Alice . Walker
as prolific names in the culinary
world who had purchased lifelong
subscriptions to the magazine, as
Longone had, many years ago.
While Longone believes there
were many factors that led to the
downfall of the magazine, which
is a central topic of her lecture,
she believes a substantial one
was the loss of its original charm
and change in structure after
being purchased by the massive
publishing house Conde Nast.
"When they started writing
articles about playing golf in
Scotland and staying in $7000
hotel rooms, I realized this
isn't written for me anymore,"
Longone said. "I think a lot of
people became discouraged at
that point."
The lasting impact of Gourmet
became the influence the
magazine has played in culinary
culture, and Longone credits the
publication with helping change
the waythe world looks at food.
"Gourmet changed the way we
think about food, and food is part
of culture," Longone said. "When
I was younger, people would pat
me on the head and say 'Oh look
how cute, she collects cookbooks,'
and it used to drive me crazy! I
would say, 'These are valuable
social documents.'You can't really
know anything about anyone
before knowing about their food."

wouldn't sayI'm a
Katherine Heigl fan. To be
honest, I don'treally care
either way about Katherine Heigl.
But tonight, the actress is making
her (welcomed?)
return to
television, and
whether you
love her or
hate her, it's
a fascinating
comeback.
Less than five ALEC
years after an STERN
unceremonious
departure from
"Grey's Anatomy" - amid rumors
of conflict between Heigl and
basically anybody and everybody.
behind-the-scenes - Heigl is
starring in and producing NBC's
"State of Affairs," a White House-
set political drama costarring
Alfre Woodard ("12 Years a
Slave") as the President of the
United States.
Heigl rose to prominence
playing Dr. Izzie Stevens on
ABC's hit medical drama. In
2007, she won a Primetime
Emmy Award for Outstanding
Supporting Actress - beating out
two "Sopranos" stars and two of
her own "Grey's" costars. That
same year,the actress starred in
"Knocked Up,"ushering in one
of the swiftest movie star rise-
and-falls in recent memory. (It
doesn't help that Heigl's ascension
corresponded with the exact time
of death of the entire romantic
comedy genre.) After peaking in
2009 with "The Ugly Truth"'s
$205 million haul, Heigl's next
five releases - from "Killers"
to "The Big Wedding" - were
both critically and commercially
savaged.
What's strange is just how
quickly Heigl has decided to
return to television. Afterclashing
with the writers on "Grey's
Anatomy," publicly withdrawing
her name from Emmy
considerationin 2008because
she didn't feel she was given
material worthy of any awards,
Heigl wisely chose to pursue her
burgeoning film career. But after
the bigscreen chewed herup and

spit her out so fast, Heigl was at a
crossroads; her decision to return
to the smallscreen is so soon that
the series she abandoned isstill
one of television's highest-rated
dramas.
In early2012, Taylor Kitsch,
like Heigl, was poised to become
one of Hollywood's fastest-rising
stars. Kitsch made a name for
himself playingffullback Tim
Riggins on NBC/DirecTV's
"Friday Night Lights."One
of the only members of the
original Panthers team who
remained a significant presence
throughout all five seasons,
Riggins was beleaguered, tortured
and often drunk.:But it was
Kitsch's portrayal that eased
the character's harsh exterior,
making Riggins one ofthe series'
most sympathetic mainstays.
In turn,for Kitsch to parlay his
breakout role onto the big screen
seemed to be the natural next
step. Unfortunately, Kitsch's
up-and-coming career suffered
back-to-back-to-back blows with
"John Carter,""Battleship" and
"Savages." And with each coming
just two months after the last,
his silverscreen aspirationswere
over before you could say "Texas
forever."
And just as Heigl retreated
back to the small screen, Kitsch
has also chosen to clingto the
medium that gave him his start.'
After nabbing a supporting role
in HBO's original movie "The
Normal Heart," the actor finally
confirmed his involvement in
the network's hotly anticipated
second season of "True Detective"
last month. Whereas the transition
from "Grey's Anatomy" to "State
of Affairs" is more of a lateral
move, Kitsch will benefit from the
added prestige a premium cable
network brings. But nonetheless,
the next phase of Kitsch's career
still mirrors that of Heigl's.
Yes, the line between film and
televisi k sleor ing increasingly
blurred with more and more stars
flocking to the small screen. But
while the transition from movies
to TV might be more fluid, moving
from television to movies is one
of the most difficultthings for an

actor to do. Even in this "golden
age," television is still a lifeboat
for "prolific" actors who can't
quite make the switch to the big
screen. Like Heigl and Kitsch, I
imagine Aaron Paul only has a few
more chances (strike one was last
spring's "Need For Speed") before
he's relegated to taking thelead in
a cable drama pilot.
NBC isdoing everything itcan
to ensure "State ofAffairs" takes
off, premiering in "The Blacklist"
's Monday night, post-"Voice"
timeslot. But even if"State of
Affairs" flops - a fate that falls
upon a very large majority ofnew
shows - Katherine Heigl would
largely come out unscathed.
Becauseultimately, television,
in all itsglory, is a much more
forgiving medium than the
big screen, if notsolely for the
constant churn of series we've
grown accustomed to. Does
anybody remember "big star" Greg
Kinnear's FOX series "Rake?"It
even premiered this year -its
mostrecentepisode airing in late
June - beforerthe network pulled
the plug.What about "Harry's
Law," Kathy Bates'NBC star
vehicle? Did you even knotvthat
Halle Berry was on TV every
Wednesday night this summer
on CBS' "Extant?" Probably not,
because when it comes down
to it, audiences will most often
hold stars accountable for their
big screen flopsthan their small
screen ones. Ittook years for Berry
to rid herself of "Catwoman" clout,
but "Extant"'s very mediocre
reception doesn't hold the same
weight or influence over the
actress.
I probably wouldn't call myself
as a Katherine Heigl fan. I don't
know if many people would. But
that shouldn't make her return to
television is any less interesting. So
tonight, you can find me watching
"State of Affairs" at 10 p.m.,
wondering what she could have

Maybe I am more of a fan than
I think?

BOOK R EV IEW
Bolafio' captures late
writer's significance

By COSMO PAPPAS
Daily Arts Writer
As the person to have last
interviewed Chilean writer
Roberto Bolano before his death
from liver
failure Bolano: A
in 2003, Biography in
it's fit-
ting that Conversations
M6nica
Maristain nica Maristain
should Melville House
write his Publishing
biogra-
phy. In "Bolano: A Biography in
Conversations," Maristain art-
fully assembles interviews with
the writer's family members,
friends, enemies and artistic
colleagues of the late novel-
ist, poet, essayist, short-story
writer and l'enfant terrible of
the Spanish-language literary
world.
The unique and sometimes
menacing power of the biog-
rapher is determining how
and what is presented from a
person's life. Particularly with
literary biography, this license
includes writing a narrative
of the interaction between the
person's life and the author's
work. They define, as T.S. Eliot
put it in his 1919 essay "Tradi-
tion and the Individual Tal-
ent," the distance between
"the man who suffers and the
mind which creates." Some-
times the former is sacrificed
to the latter, diminishing an
understanding of the work to
be so much enriched by the life
it was a part of and effacing
that life for a fiction of textual
purity.
Maristain's skill lies in pre-
cisely illustrating this rela-
tionship with measure and
meaning. To do otherwise, as
Maristain's portrait of Bola-
no the social animal demon-
strates, would be to lose the

episodes from Bolafin's life
that he adapted into situa-
tions and characters in works
such as "The Savage Detec-
tives" and "2666." From his
parents' friends to his literary
compatriots, Bolafio construct-
ed a fictional world out of the
relationships he made during
his life. Maristain's method of
oral collage, if perhaps present-
ing an overly literal and mosaic
picture of the life of this writer,
succeeds brilliantly in staying
faithful to Bolafio's tendency to
make art of his life and life of his'
art.
Maristain lavishes attention
on Bolaio's involvement with
a movement called Infrareal-
ism during his days in Mexico,
where he and others terrorized
the "Pazist" literary establish-
ment (called so for the hege-
monic devotion to Mexican
poet and 1990 Nobel laureate
Octavio Paz).
Interrupting
poetry readings,
often heckling
the readers and
generally prac-
ticing a sort of
wine-soaked
bohemianism,
they theorized
forms of lit-
erature such as
"anti-poetry"
that consciously
divorced itself
from estab-
lished traditions
in a way that
reflects (though
not to suggest a
causal relation-
ship) the oppo-
sitional lifestyle.
Bolafio's
personal
involvement
with the group
ended when he
moved to Spain

in1977, more or less precipitating
the end of the movement.
However, Bolaino would then
re-live and reanimate his time
as an Infrarealist through
his writing even as he moved
beyond it in his personal life.
Maristain's biography is a
welcome and enjoyable salve
to any inclination to write out
the life of an author, as if writ-
ers in writing forgot to live or
only did so by accident. Hers is a
story informed by personal cor-
respondence (she notes Bolano's
e-mail address, "robertoba")
with the writer. Her biography
delights in presenting Bolano's
life from the ground level, both
from the perspective of her per-
sonal connection and the con-
nections of those who played
a significant part of the life
of this massively significant
author of the twentieth and
twenty-first century.

TV/NEW MEDIA REVIEW
Peretti is really
'One of the Greats'

FILM REVIEW
'Dumb and Dumber'
sequel disappoints

Chelsea Peretti
presents nuanced
set in Netflix special
By AKSHAY SETH
ManagingArts Editor
Once upon a time, on a warm
summer afternoon, atesome point
after 12 p.m. but before 12:30, a
plate-glass
door collided A
with my
face. I could Chelsea
have cursed. Peretti:
could
have stink- One of the
eyed the Greats
door,, glared
through Availabe for
my now- streaming on Netflix
watery left
pupil, shaken my fist at it like a
disgruntled old man cheated out
of Bingo winnings. But I didn't. I
had to keep moving. After taking
off work early, I had to burn out
a seven-hour drive from Los
Angeles to San Francisco and
pick u my friend Brian ("GET
THE FUCK IN THE CAR,
BRIAN") in the distant hopes of
making a live taping of Chelsea
Peretti's first hour-long standup
special. The cool glass pressed
up against my cheek wasn't
gettinginthe way. It was awake-
up call, an adrenaline-pinching
throttle.
The first bit of verbal dialogue
in "Chelsea Peretti: One of the
Greats," which debuted on
Netflix last Friday, is the phrase
"so many trials and tribulations
brought me to this point." She
whispers them with faux-
gravitas,likesomeone convinced
the words are complete bullshit
but only partly so. Anthony
Jeselnik often uses the same
effect masterfully throughout
his act.
And it's the same puffed-
up shtick visible in eretti's
turn as Gina Linetti on Fox's
"Brooklyn Nine-Nine," where
the writing necessitates her
character perpetually tread
those lines between laughing at
her coworkers and becoming a
spectacle herself: the arrogant,
deadpanning weirdo with
an even weirder (beautiful)
penchant for hip-hop dance and
Oprah's tea parties. The final
result is in parts scene-stealing,
in parts erratic, but always,
always interesting to watch - a
magnetic presence in a show
ruled by idiosyncrasy.
Achieving a similar bearing
in 75 minutes of standup can be
difficult, only because the very
act of getting on a stage and just

demands some measure of
honesty ou a n't contrie

There she is, literally feet away from the great Akshay Seth.

reactions in live comedy. The
format is too formulaic: a comic
saysfunnythings,people laughat
said funny things. And without a
very specific environment - one
as weird as Peretti's responses to
it - it's hard to maintain the self-
reference that brands her humor.
That is, until this standup
special. This time, we're given
the typical slate of joke-telling
we'd expect at a comedy show.
There are hilarious stories
about texting your dog, richer
ones about getting relationship
advice from attractive women,
but what sets this special apart
is how openly Peretti seems
willing to play with form.
Instead of just following the
medium's natural trajectory, the
method we've seen greats like
Louis CK or George Carlin settle
for, she experiments. Carlin
and Louie have both started
specials with some variants of
a lead-up to the theater. Carlin
has a conversation with his cab
driver; Louie walks through
the streets of New York City
toward the venue. Either case
suggests the same centerpiece:
the actual standup, the spoken
word, and nothing dare break up
the careful pacing of that spoken
word, carefully rung togeher
after nights beating it into place
at comedy clubs. All building
toward this crowd of thousands.
Peretti tinkers. Rather
than Carlin or Louie, she
invokes Richard Pryor, her
jokes mercury-like in the way
they veer in temperature and
tone. Like Pryor, she interjects
running gags into her show,
one featuring her dressed as
a weepy clown and another
where she toys with audience
reaction shots (to offer any more
info would be a disservice to
how naturally she utilizes the
joke). Which isn't to say all this
hoopla serves as a crutch for
the more traditional aspects of
just standing behind a mic and
talking. Near the beginning of
the special, the gags feel a lot
more like breaths of fresh air,
but Peretti has mishandled the
momenum a bitby the end.

burying it underneath dense
standup rather than really
sticking with the opportunities
it could have created. I walked
away thinking she didn't fully
believe she could pull it off.
Partially, this has to do with
how wide-ranging the jokes
are. Though the transitions are
seamless, Peretti jumps across
a seemingly endless rolodex of
topics.
We could start with an
extended tirade about "pissing
off really hot girls" and end,
a minute later, with another
tirade about armpit liposuction.
(The highlight, though, has to
be her impression of "slipping
in pools of booty sweat.") The
effect is you really do feel like
you've sat through an hour-plus
of material, but there's never any
denying that the material itself
is jammed with great, quotable:
punchlines from cover to cover
("do you guys think it's worse to
wear a fedora or kill 15 people").
But Peretti is at her best
when she's talking about the
differences in confidence and
self-esteem - a motif used
frequently before setting up the
topics broached - and simply
so because it reasserts that
balancing act between laughing
at the spectacle and becoming
the spectacle. It stands apart
from Jeselnik, propped by its
much more open, nuanced
willingness to question self.
One of the reasons I wanted to
be there for the live rendition of
these jokes, which, together, will
undoubtedlygo downin boththe
fedoraand standup comedy halls
of fame, was hubris. I wanted to
be visible in the special, the over-
excited face cheering on Chels
from the third row. And I made,
it. I was there. Brian was there.
We were screaming, following
along with all of Chels's cues.
But there were two shows. And
we didn't make her final edit.
I spent a large portion of this
weekend straining at every
single audience shot, hoping to
spot my sweaty face.
I wasn't there. But One of the
Greatswas.

Carrey and Daniels
returnwith the
same schtick
By CONRAD FOREMAN
Daily Arts Writer
Sometimes stories demand a
follow-up. Other times fans clamor
for more material from familiar
characters.
And in these D
instances,
sequels are Dumb and
destined to Dumber To
be.
"Dumb Quality 16
and Dumber and Rave 20
To" is not Universal
one of those
instances.
Twenty years after the original
moronic adventure, Harry (Jeff
Daniels, "Looper") and Lloyd
(Jim Carrey, "The Mask") have
returned. In this follow-up effort,
Harry and Lloyd find themselves
on another cross-country voyage
in search of Harry's long-lost
daughter (Lloyd's true motivation
being sexual attraction to his
friend's daughter), who the
pair hope can provide a kidney
for Harry, who's in need of a
transplant. Along the way the duo
of dunces come into possession
of an invention that could save
humanity, placing them on the
hit-list of a trio of murderous
villains.
If the setup sounds familiar, it
mightbebecauseyoujustwatched

Beyond that, "To" relies on a
constant stream of callbacks to its

notable jokes. The puppy car
makes a brief appearance, the
audience re-acquaints with
Harry and Lloyd's blind disabled
neighbor and Lloyd introduces
the second-most annoying noise
in the world.
Despite the warmed over
jokes, practically every punchline
boils down to Harry and Lloyd
being dumb. While this doesn't
automatically derail the film,
it does place a challenge on the
writers and performers to use
.this simple gag in creative ways -
a challenge they do not live up to.

Morgan and Tamara, her allergy

out in choppy sequences instead
of in consistent subplots that run

are introduced - Danny's mother
and Lauren, both of whom are

ignored secondary characters so
much that we barely notice Bet-
sy's departure. Sadly, she is so
irrelevant to begin with that the
writers think they can continue
with no explanation. Similarly,
Bev could also completely disap-
pear from the show and we prob-
ably would not realize either.
Ultimately, "The Mindy Proj-
ect" is running out of topics that
haven't already been covered by
other rom-com sitcoms. Believe
me, I do love you, Mindy, but
season three simply feels like
an unnecessary sequel to your
movie that has already ended.
Outside of the series, Mindy
Kaling as a writer, director and
actor is so immensely talented
that I (and probably many
others) would appreciate seeing
her work in other scopes. She
has a charming on-screen
presence, but that can be shown
elsewhere in contexts besides on
"Mindy." Girl, it's time to invest
your energy in other projects.

Coaching lessons from Barnes Arico

They almost never stop
moving at the Crisler
Center. Not this Wednes-
day afternoon, and certainly not
any time in
the future. -
The

and down
the court,

one group runs down to simulate
a transition while the defense
sprints back to stop.
Three members of the
Michigan women's basketball
team's practice squad, which
consists of at least five males
along with other females, enter
as substitution on offense. The
three men run down the court
on offense - because there is no
stopping in practice - but miss
a shot attempt. Senior guard
Shannon Smith gets theball
after a rebound and beats one of
the men down the court to score.
So the practice squad member
touches the baselineand begins
running back down,just as any
other player would.
This is the hallmark of
Michigan coach Kim Barnes
Arico's team: No matter who you
are, you mustbe willing to work.
Her team is 2-0 asa result of it,
and it could be poised for a big
year.
In a dayand age in Michigan
athletics when coaching is hot
a topic, Barnes Arico is quietly
putting on a clinic, providing
a handful of lessons on how to
lead a successful team.'
1) In order to build a strong
program, you must first
temper expectations:
When Barnes Arico came
from St. John's two years
ago, she inherited a group of
five seniors, all of whom had
developed their roles. There
were shooters, defenders, ball
handlers and role players who
worked well together, making
it to the NCAA Tournament's

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico enters her third year at the helm, havingadvanced to the NCAA Tournament in year one and WNIT quarterfinals in year two.

They're working through
something off the court as much
as they are on.
Sometimes, it's best to stop
moving- but just for a little
bit, because this team is always
moving-- and reflect.
4) No matterlhow great
a tactician or recruiter you
are, you must be willing to
outwork the opponent:
Barnes Arico is brilliant in her
defensive schemes or making the
best offense out of players that
aren't necessarily tall enough,
like this year's squad. She has
turned Goree from a bench
player who had to increase
her fitness into an All-Big Ten
second-team selection. And
Elmblad from th'e fifth option on
the starting offense to a captain
for the past two years.
And she's an excellent
recruiter, stealingsome of the
nation's best prospects away
from other top teams. Just
this year, three recruiting
publications rated her incoming
class in the top 20 of the nation.
But her teams succeed
because they work harder than
the team across the court.
Take a charge in practice,
like sophomore guard Siera
Thompson did Wednesday,
and everyone will rush to that
personto cheer and support her
decision. Fail to shut down the
shooter in time as Elmblad did
Wednesday, and Barnes Arico
will make sure everyone knows
that won't be accepted.
"We pride ourselves on being
in really good shape, and being
hard workers and blue collar,"
Barnes Arico said.
Even when they trailed twice
in both games this weekend,
Michigan stormed back to win
because it worked to rebound
and worked to get open to shoot.
They never stopped moving in
the Crisler Center.
And if there's one thing you
can come to expect, it's that they
won't stop anytime soon. Their
coach won't let them, anyway.

second round.
But Barnes Arico knows
opportunities like that are rare.
They can make you look good,
but they aren't necessarily
replicable.,
That's why she's honest and
open about her team. Last year,
she said she "didn't know what
to expect" before the Wolverines
surprised teams on their way to
the quarterfinals of the WNIT.
And this year, she's looking for
players to "be who they are,"
and "not try to do too much,"
because it's incredibly tough to
live up to expectations.
She's set forth goals, part of
"the process," as she calls it,
because thebest coaches know
success isn't immediate.
"We want them to really
embrace the process instead of
the outcome," Barnes Arico said.
"Sometimes, you get too caught
up with the outcome, and you
lose focus and you stop working
on what it takes to be better."
So don't worry if the
Wolverines miss out on

the NCAA Tournament or
if they don't win a Big Ten
Championship. Look at each
player as she progresses in
February or March, and then
you'll see Barnes Arico's success.
2) If youwant your players
to do something, you must
first do it-yourself:
On Barnes Arico's team,
players "had better be in shape"
if they want to succeed. But no
one wants to have to move all the
time - even though you have to
on this team.
So Barnes Arico encouraged
not only all of her players but
also her staff to join her in on a
plan to work out every day. Now,
she has made the effort to run or
lift daily, even goingso far as to
run a marathon last year.
She knows coaches are role
models as much as they are
experts in the game, and if
she wants to win as much as
her players, she has to do the
work herself. But Barnes Arico
won't get out on the court to
run with her own players,

though, because she's "too them, when two years ago
competitive." opposing teams might have
"I think it's really important, never even thought about
when you're the leader of any mentioning them. It's tough
program, to kind of set an to live up to that pressure, so
example," she said. "If I have Barnes Arico brought them in

I'm expecting them to do things. how they performed, she

BACKUP IN THE POST
Redshirt freshman
forward Mark Donnal has
clearly established himself as
Michigan's starter in the low
post, but he can't be expected
to contribute 30-plus minutes
of productivity just yet. The
question is who can help him,
and right now, the answers
aren't quite there.
Freshman forward Ricky
Doyle played just nine minutes
against Hillsdale, scoring seven
points in the short span. He's
still in the process of recovering
from an ankle tweak and other

kept him periodically sidelined
throughout preseason practice.
Wilson, meanwhile, is
capable of playing the low post
at 6-foot-9, though his lean 220-
pound frame and remarkable
athleticism mean he fits better
at power forward.
Who the Wolverines use at
the No. 5 spot when Donnal
is on the bench will be a key
question moving forward.
They might try to answer it in
the week's upcoming games
against Bucknell and Detroit-
Mercy, one of Michigan's last
remaining stretches of low-
pressure opposition.

'M' breaks out of scoring slump

By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Editor
With its back against the wall
after a 2-5 start to the season,
the Michigan hockey team
needed a stellar weekend against
American International.
After struggling to put the,
puck in the net all year, the
Wolverines (4-5) scored 11 goals
in two games and added a pair of
tallies to the win column. With
the wins, questions surrounding
offensive-zone potency were
answered, including when Copp
and sophomore forward JT
Compher would start rolling like
they had last season.
The duo - Michigan's two
leading scorers from a year ago
- combined for seven points
this weekend. However, even
Copp admitted the defensive
issues that have victimized the
Wolverines in their five losses are
still lingering.
What happened Friday:
Sophomore defenseman
Kevin 'Lohan netted the first
goal of his career and added an
assist en route to a 5-2 win in the
Wolverines' first home contest in
nearly a month.
"You dream of your first goal
and playing for Michigan as a
little kid," Lohan said. "To be
honest, I didn't really do much....
I just had to make sure I get the

The Wolverines' newest top
line, one featuring sophomore
forward Tyler Motte, junior
forward Andrew Copp and
senior forward Andrew Sinelli
combined for five points.
"I thought they were the line
that seemed to lead the way
offensively whenever we needed
them," said Michigan coach Red
Berenson. "It just seemed when
our team started to go into a little
bit of a hump, Copp's line seemed
to generate energy."

teammates, struggled to produce

in October, tallied three points
in the game. In the third period,
a shot that was originally called
as sophomore defenseman Nolan
De Jong's first career goal was
later credited to Copp, his third
goal in three games.
The Wolverines came out
slowly in the second period and
were burned just three minutes
later. On a breakaway, American
International forward David
Norris put a shot from the blue
line past sophomore goaltender
Zach Nagelvoort to tie the score
at one.
Nagelvoort made several
strong saves to preserve the tie
before Motte tallied his third
goal of the season. Minutes later,
Compher, who had struggled in
five games on the wing, found
sophomore Max Shuart for his
second goal in two games.
What happened Saturday:
After lighting up American
International's first-string goalie
Alex Murray for 41 shots and
five goals Friday, Michigan did
even worse to substitute Hunter
Leisner on Saturday, tallying 46
shots as five different Wolverines
combined for six goals en route to

a 6-3 win.
"I think our responses to
their shifts in momentum were
very good," Copp said. "Every
time they scored, we scored
within two or three minutes.
Even tonight, when our back was
against the wall, we responded
the rightway and playedthe right
way."
Despite Michigan's scoring
barrage, itwas theYellowJackets
who struck first when forward
Carson Grolla snuck a long-range
shot past Nagelvoort for a power-
play goal.
The Wolverines found their
groove shortly afterward,
though, when senior forward
Zach Hyman finally put Michigan
on the board 9:05 into the game.
Over the next 3:30, senior
forward Travis Lynch and
sophomore forward Alex Kile
added tip-in goals of their own,
giving the Wolverines a lead they
would never relinquish.
The second period began
equally dominant for Michigan,
as it continued to pepper Leisner
with quick, mostly short-range
shots. Things looked just about
wrapped up when junior forward

Boo Nieves notched his first
goal since March 8, 2013 on a
one-timer feed from Compher,
extending the lead to three:
Yet defensive miscues by the
suddenly offensively charged
Wolverines allowed the Yellow
Jackets to notch two transition
goals, narrowing the gap to one
goal by the second intermission.
"The second period was a bad
period for us," Berenson said.
"You can't just blame the defense
- it was a team thing.
"Nagelvoort has to stop a
couple of those shots, but our
defense has to do moreto get
those guys at abad angle."
Playing back-and-forth hockey
for much of the third period, the
game looked as if it may have
had a chance to go down to the
wire. That all changed with
8:20 remaining, when Lynch
tallied his second goal of the
night from the left faceoff circle,
re-extending the lead.
The rout became official less
than a minute later when Copp
scored a power-play goal - his
third goal of the weekend and
team-high fourth of the season --
giving Michigan its 6-3 final.

For the aecond straight game,
the Michigan women's basketball
team found itself battling more
adversity than expected against

opponent.

,\lIi&lUdale, the familiar sights
of raining 3-pointers and two-
handed, breakaway dunks ruled
the day again.
Trailing early, the Wolverines
used their speed on defense and
in transition to grab a lead on the
Chargers they did not relinquish.
At the game's outset, the
Wolverines appeared to be
forcing shots from beyond the
are early in the shot clock. That,
combined with Hillsdale's
Stedman Lowry opening the
game with 11 points in the first
4:37, prompted the Wolverines
to amp up their intensity on
defense.
And once they did, they
found their rhythm. Creating
fast breaks led to easy dunks
and often resulted in open space
on the offensive end, leading
to uncontested 3-pointers.
Michigan made 9 of 11 triples to
close the first half after starting
0-for-3 from deep.
"I think they were a little more
comfortable with us sitting back
and trying to negotiate screens
and make sure we weren't getting
back cut and stuff like that,"
said sophomore guard Derrick
Walton Jr. "Once the guys kind
of put more heat on the ball, we
generated more steals and leak-
outs, and we're really good in
transition, so (we) got some easy
baskets."
Walton, sophomore forward
Zak Irvin and junior guard Caris
LeVert hit consecutive 3-pointers
in a one-minute span to pull
Michigan back into the game.
The Chargers operate out
of the swing offense, which
emphasizes ball motion around
the perimeter to create open
cuts to the basket. But while

Michigan worried about those
cuts, Hillsdale was hitting shots
from outside. Lowry sank two
triples in the first three minutes
before the Wolverines went to a
more aggressive defensive set.
Michigan went on a 28-9. run
over a 10-minute span in the
middle of the first half and went
into the break up 50-33. Of those
50 points,16 were off turnovers.
The Chargers cut the
Michigan lead to 10 early in the
second frame, but the Wolverines
clamped down again, allowing
just eight points in the last eight
minutes.
"We just put more pressure on
the ball," said Michigan coach
John Beilein. "Get the guy so he's
got to pivot a little bit more and
then get in some passing lanes.
That was the difference to let us
get away, or that could have been
an 8-10 point game."
One of the most active
defenders was freshman forward
Kameron Chatman, who had
three steals in the first half and
finished the game with four.
Chatman used his length to
break up telegraphed passes and
hit outlets to push the ball up
court.
And when the run was on,
LeVert was usually in the thick
of it. The junior finished with 21
points and nine assists, dishing if
he was pressed and taking lanes
when he saw them.
Michigan's superior speed and
athleticism showed in the open
court, while Hillsdale struggled
togetbackon defense.
"We were just talking more,
talking and communicating,
which led to getting in
transition," Irvin said. "When
our defense turns into our
offense, we're pretty good."

VOLLEYBALL
Wolverines take
care of Ohio St.

Trio forming imposing line

By OLIVER HENRY
For the Daily
After losing to No. 17 Ohio
State in Columbus earlier in the
season, the Michigan volleyball
team got revenge Saturday,
winning a four-set thriller,
25-22,25-14,21-25,25-23.
Unlike the previous meeting,
the Wolverines controlled the
tempoofthematchandgarnered
much-needed momentum to
win two of the first three sets.
Despite Michigan's fast start,
the Buckeyes refused to go down
easily, Just as the Wolverines
began tasting a victory at 24-17
in the fourth set, Ohio State
rallied to make the score 24-23.
However, freshman defensive
specialist Caroline Knop ended
the late threat with a kill to give
Michigan (7-9 Big Ten, 12-14
overall) the much-needed win.
Despite the score, the
Wolverines encountered their
share of struggles during the
match.
The first set was off to a
shaky start with three Michigan
errors, but after an Ohio State
timeout, theWolverines' quality
of play improved.
Throughout the set, Knop,
freshman outside hitter Adeja
Lambert, freshman middle
blocker Claire Kieffer-Wright
and sophomore middle blocker
Abby Cole paced the Wolverine
attack with 15 combined kills.
Even while struggling serving,
Michigan was able to capitalize
on Buckeye errors and gain a
17-12 lead midway through the
first frame. Ohio State (9-7, 18-10)
foughttoclosethemarginto19-18,
but the Wolverines persevered
through great play from junior
defensive specialist/libero
Tiffany Morales and senior setter
Lexi Dannemiller. Morales had
three key digs while Dannemiller
posted an impressive 14 assists to
leadMichigan to a 25-22 first-set
victory.
The second set exemplified

the growth of this young
Wolverine team and its ability to
rally and triumph. After trailing
7-3, Michigan rallied to take a
15-11 lead. Following an Ohio
State timeout, the rest of the
second set belonged solely to
the Wolverines. Michigan went
on a 10-3 run, highlighted by a.
succession of kills by Knop and
three straight thundering kills
by Lambert to secure a 25-14
victory for the Wolverines.
Despite losing the second set,
the Buckeyes were able to battle
back and win the third.
Both sides traded points early
in the set, leading to a 9-9 tie.
However, Ohio State received
help from an assortment of
players who contributed kills to
attain a 19-16 margin late in the
frame. The lead held, despite
Lambert and Cole posting five
and four kills, respectively.
Michigan came out with a
distinct ferocity in the fourth set
and displayed increased effort to
attack and frustrate its rivals.
"If you play with energy, effort'
and enthusiasm," Knop said.
"That's allyou need, and you will
win 95 percent of the time."
Michigan jumped out to
an early 8-4 lead, and then
extended that to 14-7 when Ohio
State called a timeout. Knop and
Lambert paced the attack with
four and three kills, respectively,
and Knop made the final kill to
sealithe victory.
With four games left in the
season, Michigan coach Mark
Rosen believes the team can go
at least 3-1 to reach the needed
overall record of .500 in order,
to earn an NCAA tournament
bid. But for that to happen,
Rosen knows improvement is
still needed.
"We have really tried to adopt
this mindset of growth mindset,"
Rosen said. "We need to continue
to get better.... We want to walk
in the gym and make sure we
walk out at a different level, and
that's a daily process."

And just like that, Red
Berenson has seemingly struck
gold again, using his wizardry
to form another formidable
line that can create countless
chances for the Michigan
hockey team.
This past week, the
Wolverines' coach moved
sophomore forward JT
Compher back to center - his
normal position - after he
struggled on the wing. He
shifted junior forward Boo
Nieves from center to right
wing and completed the line
with sophomore forward Max
Shuart.
Berenson said prior to the
weekend that this line could
be the team's best. And he may
be right after the trio tallied
a combined seven points -
two goals and five assists - in
Michigan's weekend sweep
over American International
College.
From the opening draw
Friday, Compher, Nieves and
Shuart found chemistry in
Compher's playmaking ability,
Nieves' speed and length, and
Shuart's skating ability and
toughness.
At the 10:54 mark in
the second period Friday,
sophomore defenseman
Michael Downing dumped the
puck into the Yellow Jackets'
zone, and Nieves raced down
the ice to beat out an icing. Once,
he did, he found Compher at
the right circle, and the center
immediately slid a puck across
the zone to Shuart who then
found twine to finish a tic-tac-
toe goal..
"I can't say enough about
those guys - they're both
really good players," Shuart
said. "Obviously, I was just in
the right spot at the right time.
Anyone probably could have put
that in, so it was just a really
good play from the start. Boo
beating out the icing, using his
speed to get on there off a great

More so, Nieves, Compher
and Shuart have impressed
despite the line's most potent
scoring threat, Compher, not
finding the back of the net
through nine games. This isn't
new to Compher, though, as he
also failed to find twine through
nine games last season.
And even though he may not
be scoring as much as he'd like,
the Wolverines know it's not for
a lack of effort. Berenson said
Compher is "starting to be the
JT we saw last year." And his
teammates agree.
"He usually does find the
back of the net," Nieves said.
"But he seems to be struggling
here, but it's nothing to worry
about, because he's a goal-
scorer and he'll find a way. Once
he scores one, I'm sure he'll
score 100 more."
For now, it appears Berenson
has found the right linemates to
get Compher going.
