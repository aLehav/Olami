A2 Clinton supporters 
set sights on party unity

‘U’ expert 
discusses

warnings

University of Michigan alumna Amira Belwafa converses with others at the Hillary victory party at Melange on Tuesday.

Local victory event 

turns focus to 

campaign against 

Trump

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Summer News Editor

To mark Hillary Clinton’s 

victory 
for 
the 
Democratic 

nomination, 
several 
dozen 

grassroots supporters of Clinton 
gathered to celebrate at a Main 
Street 
restaurant 
Tuesday 

evening, with many eyeing the 
general election campaign to 
come.

In the Michigan presidential 

primary in March, Ann Arbor 
voters 
favored 
Clinton’s 

challenger, 
Senator 
Bernie 

Sanders (I–VT) by 15,409 to 
12,014 votes — due in part to 
strong 
grassroots 
drives 
for 

voter turnout from University of 
Michigan students — and Sanders 
narrowly carried the state in an 

upset victory.

Nonetheless, the Associated 

Press declared Monday that 
Clinton had won enough delegates 
to secure the nomination, and her 
victory was further cemented by 
winning four of the six primary 
contests held Tuesday.

Michigan — which is typically 

considered a Democratic state 
in presidential elections — has 
come into focus as a state in 
which presumptive Republican 
nominee Donald Trump can 
build on unconventional support 
from blue collar white voters.

Suzanne Perkins, a city resident 

and lead grassroots organizer 
for 
Clinton 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, 

expressed confidence, based on 
her experience canvassing Ann 
Arbor voters, that Democrats in 
Michigan would be able to rally 
behind Clinton in November even 
though Sanders won the state in 
the primary.

“Even when we met Bernie 

people, people said to us, ‘I’m 
going to vote for Bernie, but 
please come back in November,’” 

Perkins said. “People were just 
generous and sweet and very 
nice, so I don’t think we’re going 
to have any problem unifying the 
party in Ann Arbor. Nobody’s 
angry.”

Perkins 
also 
said 
she 
is 

sympathetic to many Sanders 
supporters 
— 
particularly 

students 
— 
but 
reaffirmed 

that she believes Clinton to be 
the strongest candidate in the 
general election.

“I voted for Jesse Jackson in 

my first election, and I knew 
he wasn’t going to win, but I 
liked what he was saying, and 
ultimately I knew what he 
was saying would never pass 
Congress,” Perkins said, referring 
to the two-time Democratic 
candidate 
for 
president. 
“I 

understand when you’re voting 
for the first time you feel 
passionate about a particular 
person.”

Ann Arbor resident Jason 

Morgan — another grassroots 
Clinton organizer — echoed these

RESEARCH

Neurology professor 
believes increased 
mobile phone use is 
not linked to cancer 

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

Due to various studies with 

conflicting results on the effects 
of constant radio-frequency wave 
exposure from cell phones on 
human health, there has been a 
national debate as to whether or not 
mobile devices should come with 
warning labels.

According to the Pew Research 

Center, 49 percent of cell phone 
users said their cellular devices 
would be very hard to give up. 

Cell 
phones 
can 
cause 

distractions that can lead to severe 
consequences: For instance, there 
are reports of people accidentally 
walking off piers or getting into car 
accidents as a result of texting while 
driving — which poses threats not 
only to texters but to those around 
them. 

In addition to simple distractions, 

some believe cell phones cause 
neurological damages. According to 
the Food and Drug Administration, 
cell phones emit low levels of radio-
frequency energy, which has led to 
debates over the neurological safety 
of cell phones. The FDA states there 
is a common misconception since 
people 
confuse 
radio-frequency 

energy with the more harmful 
electromagnetic 
energy 
found 

in X-rays; whereas, the radio-
frequency energy from cell phones 
is harmless, according to the FDA. 

Similarly, research from the

SACUA Chair William Schultz speaks at the SACUA meeting at the Fletcher 
Administrative Building on May 23rd. 

Proposal has been 

a longstanding 

priority among CSG 

members 

By ETHAN LEVIN

For the Daily

The 
Senate 
Advisory 

Committee on University Affairs 
met Wednesday to discuss the 
possibility 
of 
increasing 
the 

presence of undergraduate and 
graduate students on a range of 
SACUA 
committees; 
however, 

the idea was met with backlash 
from several members of the 
committee.

The 
implementation 
of 

a 
system 
that 
encourages 

broadened 
communication 

between faculty members and 
students has been a longstanding 
priority for members of Central 
Student 
Government. 
The 

specific proposal arose in an 
earlier meeting between CSG 
President David Schafer and 
Chukwuka Mbagwu, Rackham 
Student Government president.

During 
their 
meeting, 

Schafer and Mbagwu agreed 
that 
there 
should 
be 
more 

substantial 
involvement 
of 

students in various academic 
advisory 
committees. 
These 

positions would allow CSG and 
professional students to channel 
their 
desire 
for 
institutional 

academic 
improvements 

through 
participation 
in 

SACUA 
committees 
and 
to 

work 
in 
consultation 
with 

Rackham Student Government 
representatives.

SACUA Chair Bill Schultz 

proposed additional seats for 
another Ross School of Business 
student in the Committee of 
Financial Affairs, a law student 
in the Graduate Student Advisory 
Committee and a medical student 
in the Medical Affairs Advisory 
Committee

Silke-Maria 
Weineck, 

chair 
of 
the 
department 
of 

Comparative Literature and an 
LSA representative, opposed the 

proposal, saying the program 
could be more disruptive than 
expected.

“I’m familiar with several 

officers who actually complained 
about this program and said that 
they weren’t always sure whether 
this was productive,” Weineck 
said. “I know when I was a 
student, I certainly didn’t have 
the slightest clue how a university 
worked.”

Weineck 
additionally 

expressed 
worry 
that 

students 
would 
encounter 

misunderstandings, 
which 

would act contrary to SACUA’s 
efficiency.

Other 
members 
shared 

Weineck’s 
concerns 
that 

increasing undergraduate and 
graduate 
student 
presence 

on 
University 
of 
Michigan 

committees 
could 
create 

miscommunication, 
ultimately 

acting contrary to the program’s 
intended mission.

Robert 
Ortega, 
associate 

professor in the School of Social 
Work, said the time required to 
train students on how best to 
provide constructive comments to 
the various committee meetings 
is cause for concern, based on 
his experience. Ortega said, once 
trained, student representatives 
are sometimes reticent to voice 
their views, as they do not feel 
qualified to represent the whole 
student body.

Schultz 
responded 
to 
the 

criticism, arguing the purpose 
of the program is to promote 
professional 
development, 

making it easier for students 
to envisage futures as faculty 
in their respective academic 
fields. By matching students to 
committees 
of 
corresponding 

interest, Schultz said the program 
makes an effort to ensure that 
people have a natural interest in 
their comittees. 

“Based on my experience, the 

presence of these students is 
strong,” Schultz said.

During 
the 
Wednesday 

meeting, 
committee 
members 

also discussed the possibility of 
campus-wide faculty training in

Resolution to disclose Amtrak 
station study fails in narrow vote

City councilmembers 
criticize lack of project 
transparency regarding 

internal report

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Summer News Editor

The 
proposed 
Ann 
Arbor 

Amtrak station — which has been 
long-delayed — came under fire 
for an alleged lack of transparency 
from City Council members at 
Monday evening’s meeting.

The rail station was originally 

proposed in 2009, and the city 
accepted a $2.8 million federal 
grant to explore options for a new 
facility in 2012. An alternatives 
analysis on potential locations of 
the new station was expected for 
public release in the summer of 
2015 but has been delayed without 
explanation by city staff members. 

A 
Freedom 
of 
Information 

Act request by the Ann Arbor 
News in May found significant 
portions of the draft analysis 
and 
correspondence 
between 

city 
officials, 
the 
Michigan 

Department of Transportation and 
Federal Railway Administration to 
be heavily redacted. 

Councilmembers 
Sumi 

Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1), Jack 
Eaton (D–Ward 4) and Jane Lumm 
(I–Ward 2) introduced a resolution 
demanding the disclosure of the 
entire report and all relevant 
correspondence, 
arguing 
this 

would be in the public interest.

However, other councilmembers 

and Mayor Christopher Taylor 
expressed concern that a premature 
disclosure would have unintended 
consequences. 
The 
resolution 

for disclosure failed in a narrow 
5-to-6 vote. All councilmembers 
acknowledged 
they 
themselves 

had not yet seen the report or 
the relevant correspondence, but 
those opposed to the resolution 
expressed faith in the city staff 
conducting the analyses. 

In 
addition 
to 
Eaton, 

Kailasapathy 
and 
Lumm, 

councilmembers Sabra Briere (D–
Ward 1) and Chuck Warpehoski 
(D–Ward 
5) 
voted 
in 
favor 

of 
disclosure. 
Voting 
against 

disclosure were Councilmembers 
Kirk Westphal (D–Ward 2), Julie 
Grand 
(D–Ward 
3), 
Zachary 

Ackerman (D–Ward 3), Graydon 
Krapohl (D–Ward 4) and Chip 
Smith (D–Ward 5) — in addition to 
Mayor Taylor.

Eaton said the development 

of the rail station project cannot 

continue behind closed doors, 
arguing that early public input 
through a transparent process 
would prevent issues further down 
the project timeline, pointing 
to the backlash concerning the 
University of Michigan’s lack of 
transparency in its recent attempt 
to construct a maintenance facility 
near several Ann Arbor residential 
neighborhoods.

“They went about the entire 

decision making process without 
really engaging people,” Eaton 
said, referring to the University’s 
administration. “If we want to 
avoid that kind of public outcry 
when we release information, we 
need to engage the public and let 
them know what the state and 
federal agencies believe are the 
problems with our ideas of the 
potential sites.”

Eaton and Kailasapathy also said 

negative rumors were circulating 
among their constituents about 
the project, and a disclosure would 
dispel these concerns. 

Taylor said the early release of 

the draft analysis could provide 
misleading 
and 
inaccurate 

information 
that 
would 
skew 

the public input process to the 
project. Taylor insisted that only 
a finalized report with approval

Petition to prevent library 
lot sale reflects diverging 
visions for A2 downtown

ANN ARBOR

Residents oppose 
construction of 
high-rise building 

on vacant plot

By ISHI MORI

Daily Staff Reporter

Monday, a group of 
Ann 

Arbor citizens presented 5,779 
signatures to City Council in a 
petition aimed at halting the sale 
of the city-owned parking lot to a 
private high-rise developer.

The debate surrounding the 

parking lot is another episode 
between 
residents 
who 
feel 

downtown 
needs 
to 
change 

for further growth and those 
who are content with the status 
quo of low-rise shops. Similar 
issues arose in 2012 with the 
controversialFoundry 
Lofts 

luxury apartment development. 

If City Clerk Jackie Beaudry 

can validate at least 4,616 of 
those signatures, the Ann Arbor 
Committee for the Community 
Commons can put a proposal 
on the November ballot to stop 
any sale of the city-owned lot 
to private developers and could 
instead develop a park and civic 
center commons.

The petition was delivered after 

the council voted 6 to 5 against 
putting the library parking lot 
question on the ballot in fall 2015.

Alan Haber, the leader of the 

petition, told the Daily he is 
optimistic about his prospects. 
Though his group has no concrete 
plans on what to do with the land, 
Haber 
expressed 
excitement 

about the many possibilities a win 
in November could bring.

“My plan is to create a situation 

where everyone in Ann Arbor 
can imagine what it is they would 
like as a center of their city and 
somehow put those ideas into a 
common pot, and we mix them 
up and see what comes out in 
the most beautiful way possible,” 
Haber said. “But the powers that 
be have labeled all those ideas 
irrelevant, so we’ve had to go 
through a political process.”

Haber suggested as possibilities 

a 
municipal 
auditorium, 
a 

museum of city history or an 
environmental education center.

Ten years in the making

The 2006 Calthorpe Report, a 

downtown redevelopment policy 
plan 
created 
through 
public 

design workshops, recommended 
the 
library 
parking 
lot 
be 

converted into a “town square” 
and underground parking space, 
with residential development on 
top.

Following 
the 
report’s 

recommendations, the Downtown 
Development Authority approved 
construction of an underground 
parking lot in 2007, but not a 
town square. All proposed parks 
were rejected and instead two 
proposals for hotel-conference 
centers — similar what is being 
proposed right now — were 
chosen. 
Citizen 
opposition 

prevented a hotel’s construction, 
and 
the 
50-year-old 
surface 

parking lot was then remodeled as 
a placeholder.

Seven years later, a 2013 Park 

Advisory 
Commission 
survey 

indicated 
that 
76.2 
percent 

of 
respondents 
thought 
Ann 

Arbor would benefit from more 
downtown open spaces — like 
a park or town square — and 
41.5 percent of pro open-space 
respondents chose the library 
parking lot in question as their 
first-choice spot to build such a 
space.

 A battle of contradictions
Despite large resident support, 

some have reservations about 
the 
petition’s 
viability. 
City 

Councilmember 
Sabra 
Briere 

(D–Ward 1) said that though she 
will support either a civic center 
or building in the lot, the green 
park envisioned by many of the 
petitioners would be structurally 
difficult to build.

“For many people, what they 

imagine is a green park with 
trees,” she said. “(The surface 
parking lot is) a roof, and so it’s 
designed to hold pavement, which 
is a lot lighter than wet soil.”

Briere 
said 
the 
existing 

infrastructure can never house

Recently, the University has made a 

show of support for survivors of sexual 
assault. Michigan is one of 200 colleges 
in the United States taking part in the 
“It’s on Us” campaign — launched by 
the White House in September 2014 
in an effort to end sexual violence on 
college campuses — and, this past 
winter semester, it rolled out a newer 
and more thorough sexual misconduct 
policy. 
Unfortunately 
for 
the 

University, these steps forward might 
be forgotten in the face of its current 
situation, as the student body is once 
again reminded of how the University 
has repeatedly failed survivors of 
sexual assault. Take, for instance, 
the case of Brandon Gibbons, whose 
punishment for sexual misconduct 
came nearly four years after the 
incident occurred. Or the case of Drew 
Sterrett, who was able to bring forth a 
lawsuit and have his charges dropped 
because his case was botched by the 
University. If a few campaigns and an 
updated policy are all the University 
has to offer to negate a slew of failures 
toward the student body, the campus 
is forced to view any new mistake as 
business as usual.

A 
seriously 
concerning 
point 

revealed by the Detroit Free Press’ 
investigation is the fact that the 
University is requesting fewer cases to 
be reviewed. When this investigation 
began, the federal government initially 
focused on only three cases, but the 
OCR is now requesting to view about 
180 cases, a relatively standard practice 
as 
these 
investigations 
proceed. 

Though this request for all 180 cases 
was only sent in October 2015, it is 
disappointing that the University 
is continuing with this pattern of 
uncooperative delays, even after the 
situation became more serious. In an 
email disclosed in the Detroit Free 
Press report summarizing a conference 
call on the issue in December 2015, 
Patricia Petrowski, Associate Vice 
President 
and 
Deputy 
General 

Counsel, wrote: “We then asked again 
why it is necessary for OCR to have all 
documentation regarding 180 different 
complaints, as opposed to 100, 90, 75, 
50, or some lower number in order 
to determine whether the University 
is apporpriately handling student 
sexual misconduct allegations.” One 
would think that a university that 
acknowledges the seriousness of this 
situation, as this institution claims, 
would 
appreciate 
the 
additional 

insight a large sample size provides 
to investigations, but this seemingly 
simple principle of statistics remains 
moot in this case. Though these 
documents may be damning towards 
the University’s reputation, for the 
sake of its students, this institution 
should hand over all of the documents 
that have been requested in a timely 
fashion.

One problem with the nature of this 

investigation is that repercussions for 
the University are unlikely. The only 
punishment that the OCR can inflict 
on the University is the restriction 
of federal financial aid funds for 
programs, such as Pell Grants and 

federal 
student 
loans 
— 
which 

would make it nearly impossible for 
students on financial aid to attend 
the University. Such a threat is widely 
regarded as ineffective, as the impact of 
such a decision would be so devestating 
that the Department of Education 
would only use it in the most extreme 
circumstances. In other words, nobody 
thinks this is a threat the Department 
of Education would reallistically 
follow through on. This has therefore 
seemingly 
given 
the 
University 

freedom to respond in a timeline it sees 
fit, a responsibility that it has not used 
in its students’ best interest.

By continuing to kick the can down 

the road, the University is failing to 
protect its student body. The University 
is certainly concerned that negative 
practices may become public during 
the course of such an investigation, 
which would no doubt harm the 
reputation of this institution. In the 
long run, however, transparency in 
this serious investigation should be 
prioritized over all else — including 
reputation. The campus climate and 
Association of American Universities 
studies released last year confirmed 
to students that the University has 
a large-scale problem with sexual 
misconduct. Continuing to delay 
the OCR’s investigation process only 
continues to affirm fears that the 
University does not have a legitimate 
interest in solving the campus sexual 
misconduct crisis. This issue impacts 
everyone and, as such, it deserves 
urgent transparency.

Edited and managed by students at 

the University of Michigan since 1890.

For the past two years, the University of Michigan has been under investigation 
by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights for its handling of 
allegations of sexual violence. Documents released in the Detroit Free Press 
this weekend indicate that the OCR initially asked for documents pertaining to 
the investigations of sexual misconduct on campus in February 2014, and the 
University has repeatedly requested extensions on the deadline to deliver those 
documents. While it is reasonable that the University would need additional time 
to comply with added document requests, we are concerned about the University’s 
lack of transparency in this investigation process given these delays.

Eliminating ‘basic’

T

here is something to be said 
for proclaiming loud and 
proud that you’re “basic.” 

It shows the world that you like 
things 
people 

may judge you 
for, 
but 
you 

don’t care. And 
you 
shouldn’t. 

According 
to 

Urban Dictionary, the relatively 
recent definition of the term 
“basic” has become an adjective 
used to describe something that is 
“obscenely obvious,” whether it be 
the way someone dresses, acts or 
an activity someone participates 
in. This, in turn, has become a term 
used to judge one’s preference for a 
Starbucks pumpkin spice latte or a 
tattoo of a sun and moon.

Scrolling through Facebook a 

while back, I came across an article 
from a page that a friend had liked 
titled “20 tattoos you’ll always 
find on basic girls.” Interested and 
procrastinating, I clicked on the 
link. As I scrolled through, I saw 
numerous tattoos that I could even 
see myself getting. Feeling a bit 
ashamed that I might fall among 
the category of “basic,” I clicked 
off.

But a few weeks later, again 

procrastinating on Facebook, I 
saw a profile picture of a girl who 
went to my elementary school: a 
selfie of her and her friend holding 
Starbucks to-go cups. The caption 
read: “Basic, but on purpose.” At 
first, I thought to myself, why 
would she do that? “Basic” isn’t 
a term that she should want to 
associate herself with. She knew 
what people might say. So she beat 
them to it. She wears the label loud 
and proud.

This 
immediately 
got 
me 

thinking about a Michigan Daily 
column I had read by Aarica Marsh 
titled “My tattoos are for me.” 
In her piece, she asserted these 
tattoos are for her, and she should 
not have to explain or justify them 
to anyone. They mean something to 
her, and she isn’t looking for them 
to mean something to someone 
else. Then she very aptly asks us if 
we sometimes keep our comments 
to ourselves. After seeing this 
girl’s profile picture, remembering 
Marsh’s column, I reflected on an 
important fact of life we don’t often 
accept: People like what they like 
and shouldn’t be judged for it.

Marsh’s comments hit home for 

me as I began to ponder thoughts 
I had in the past but never really 
thought deeply about until now. 
Can’t people just enjoy things? 
So what if they are sugary drinks 

from Starbucks, or tattoos of a sun 
and moon on their ankles? People 
can’t help what they like and they 
shouldn’t be judged for it. Putting 
a label on something and judging 
someone by calling them “basic” 
can only make someone feel bad 
about their choices — make them 
think that there is something wrong 
with them for liking these things. 
We shouldn’t be shaming people 
for a food, product or design they 
like. People enjoy these products 
because there is something that 
they like about them.

For years, I’ve been told that 

my taste in music isn’t the most 
refined. Admittedly, you can find 
me jamming out to songs you 
probably heard at every middle 
school dance or on a 15-year-old’s 
iPod playlist. In fact, I rarely talked 
about my favorite songs because 
I’ve been overly cautious of what 
others might think. Many times, I 
have found myself trying to justify 
my taste in music to others. “It’s got 
a good beat.” “It’s easy to dance to.”

For a while, it was even hard for 

me to accept my music preferences 
and not be completely embarrassed 
if someone were to catch a glimpse 
of my music library. And the time 
it took me to accept myself and 
the things that I liked was very 
much a result of being judged by 
others who raised an eyebrow at 
the songs I played on repeat, the 
clothes I wore or the movies I 
enjoyed. I’m not asking everyone to 
stay silent about their preferences. 
But disliking something, whether 
it’s a Starbucks drink, a seemingly 
simple tattoo or an old Taylor 
Swift song, is not the same thing 
as making someone feel bad about 
liking these things. 

If “basic” didn’t have such a 

negative connotation, I wouldn’t 
have such a problem with using 
it. But more often than not, the 
term is used to judge someone 
for their choices; there should 
be no place for such a term in 
our everyday language. Though 
people have begun to embrace 
the term, as my former classmate 
did, to wear it loud and proud, she 
was forced to do so because of the 
overwhelmingly judgmental use 
of the word. Don’t throw a label at 
someone for the things they enjoy. 
In fact, while I specifically talk 
about the term “basic,” there is a 
larger culture of judgement that 
is important to recognize. No one 
is the same, and we’d do well to 
embrace our differences.

Inquiry deserves a timely response

FROM THE DAILY


The controversial six-month 

sentencing for Stanford swimmer 
Brock Turner and the language 
used 
by 
the 

defendant 
and the judge 
have revealed 
the 
societal 

indifference toward rape. In this 
case, and in current culture in 
general, there is a dismissal of 
the credibility of the survivor 
by 
questioning 
whether 
the 

survivor’s 
actions 
may 
have 

provoked or enabled the attack. 
While 
these 
questions 
are 

common, they are part of a 
cultural indifference toward rape 
that fails to hold perpetrators 
accountable and subsequently 
invalidates the suffering of the 
survivor.

After reading the survivor’s 

letter to Turner, which was 
read aloud in court, we can see 
that the initial report attempts 
to minimize the severity of 
Turner’s actions by listing his 
swimming lap times and his 
numerous extracurriculars. This, 
more than anything, seems like 
an attempt to evoke sympathy for 
Turner. In reality, the individual 
in need of support is the survivor, 
not Turner. As the survivor 
indicates, these statistics were 
listed 
immediately 
after 
the 

description of the rape. By doing 
this, the author of the article 
tried to avoid painting him as a 
criminal. He may have raped an 
unconscious woman, but other 
than that, he is really just a 
successful student-athlete.

What’s more alarming are the 

questions the survivor was asked 
in court. As her letter indicates, 
she was asked how much she 
drank and what she was wearing. 
In reality, these questions are 
irrelevant. They play on the idea 
that perhaps she was partially 
responsible for his actions. The 
mentality is that since she was 
drinking, she was letting her 
guard down. The defense was 
trying to push the notion that 
if she didn’t drink so much, she 
could have easily resisted and 
prevented the situation. To add to 
that, the question of her clothing 
works with the idea that dressing 
provocatively or promiscuously 
is asking for sex and that she 

shouldn’t have dressed in a 
manner that may attract a man.

Let me be clear: Clothing and 

alcohol consumption are never 
responsible for sexual assault. 
No lack of clothing indicates 
consent. Consent is not a style 
of dress or style of dance. The 
Universitiy’s sexual misconduct 
policy says “consent is a clear 
and 
unambiguous 
agreement, 

expressed 
outwardly 
through 

mutually 
understandable 

words or actions, to engage in 
a particular activity,” must be 
“voluntarily given” and “cannot 
be obtained through coercion or 
force.” Consent is not kissing or 
a mere back rub, which, as the 
survivor’s letter indicates, was 
precisely what Turner cited in 
his initial defense.

Turner’s father released a 

statement on social media that 
further 
epitomizes 
cultural 

indifferences to rape. First, he 
describes the rape carried out 
by his son as “20 minutes of 
action.” This treats the events 
as perhaps a typical one-night 
stand or a casual hookup. He 
goes on to say that his son’s 
actions were not violent, but 
I would argue that rape is 
inherently violent. There is 
nothing peaceful about people 
thrusting 
themselves 
on 

defenseless 
individuals 
who 

haven’t expressed consent. The 
survivor in Turner’s case even 
noted scratches and abrasions 
across her body.

Finally, in his justification 

for the six-month sentence, 
the judge indicated he feared 
“a prison sentence would have 
a severe impact on him,” and 
“there is less moral culpability 
attached 
to 
the 
defendant, 

who is … intoxicated.” This 
frustrates 
me 
the 
most. 

Once again referring to the 
University’s Sexual Misconduct 
Policy, it is the responsibility of 
the initiator of each individual 
sexual activity to obtain the 
consent of the other individual. 
If Turner was too intoxicated 
to 
attempt 
to 
obtain 
his 

survivor’s consent, let alone to 
notice that she was incapable of 
consenting, then he should not 
have been pursuing sex.

Given that Turner admitted

to 
wanting 
to 
hook 
up 

with 
someone, 
it 
was 
his 

responsibility then to ensure 
that 
his 
judgment 
wasn’t 

severely impaired by alcohol 
and that his potential partner 
was capable of consenting. He 
failed to do that. I cannot fault 
an individual for wanting to 
have sex — it’s human nature. 
But most individuals seeking 
sex have no problem taking the 
necessary precautions to avoid 
putting themselves in situations 
like Turner’s. Regardless of 
whether he intended to rape 
someone, he failed to perform 
the simple task of obtaining 

consent 
because 
he 
was 

intoxicated.

Ultimately, the Brock Turner 

case has become a reflection 
of 
a 
societal 
indifference 

toward rape. The language 
of 
the 
defendant 
and 
the 

judge mirrors a tendency to 
invalidate the suffering of rape 
survivors while simultaneously 
removing 
accountability 

from the rapist and placing 
the 
responsibility 
on 
the 

shoulders of the survivor. If 
an individual drinks too much, 
the consequence should be 
the natural punishment of a 
hangover: vomiting, blackouts, 

a visit to the hospital or a 
citation — not rape. If an 
individual chooses to dress 
promiscuously, the individual 
is 
not 
offering 
themselves 

up for sex. We need to make 
tremendous progress in our 
attitudes toward rape, and that 
involves recognizing that the 
survivor is never responsible. 
Instead of making excuses for 
the perpetrators, we need to 
hold them accountable and 
ensure that they understand 
their actions are inexcusable.

Governors Ball brings music and thrills

MUSIC FESTIVAL REVIEW

Festival features 
both talent and 
disappointment

By NATALIE ZAK

Daily Community Culture Editor

NEW YORK, N.Y. — It was the 

best of times, it was the worst of 
times — it was a music festival 
scheduled for three days that 
only stretched to two. There was 
music and laughter, giddiness and 
excitement, but also there was 
deep, unadulterated betrayal as the 
three-day Governors Ball festival 
stopped abruptly in its tracks after 
the second evening came to a close. 

But, for the first 48 hours, 

festival 
goers 
were 
in 
bliss. 

Perfect 80 degree weather blessed 
Randall’s Island on the first day 
and for most of the second, until 
the rain came crashing down at 
6 and refused to cease until the 
entire 
premises 
was 
flooded. 

But, the spirit of Governors Ball 
refused to die in the puddle of mud 
that swelled up around the feet of 
attendees and drenched the entire 
island. The spirit lived on in the 
music junkies who ran through the 
rain towards the stage, towards 
whatever musical agent would 
make the torrential downpour 
more bearable and bring a little 
warmth to their shivering spines.

The 
Strokes, 
The 
Killers 

and Kanye West were all set to 
headline. The Strokes and The 
Killers performed. I know safety 
was of paramount concern for the 
Governors Ball organizers when 
deciding to cancel the third day 
of the festival, and I know the 90 
percent chance for thunderstorms 
could only breed disaster, but there 
was always hope. And, sitting 
here, inside, typing away, I’m 
overcome with nostalgia for the 
exhilaration and adrenaline rush 
of the first two days while trying 
to escape despair for the death of 
day three. This paradox exists on a 
momentous scale only because the 
first two days were highlighted by 
extraordinary bands and singers. 
Governors Ball 2016 was taken 
from us prematurely, and this 
will weigh heavy on my heart for 
quite a bit, but so will the ecstatic 
memories of the first two days, 
days marked by performances 
never paid testament to before.

Years & Years

“He’s like a cooler Troye Sivan,” 

the girl standing next to me said 
upon laying eyes on the lead singer 
of Years & Years, Olly Alexander. 
An alt pop band out of London, 
Years & Years brought a frenzy of 
energy to the stage as they burst 
into their hit single “King” and 
Alexander danced, kicked and 
spun across Big Apple Stage. With 
a three-piece ensemble, little of the 
stage was covered, but as the band 
channeled their alt pop sound and 
Alexander spun around stage in a 
rainbow jumpsuit, I couldn’t take 
my eyes away. Slower anthems like 
“Eyes Shut” and a finale of “Desire” 
only did more to solidify their 
entrance and eventual dominance 
of the electropop scene, calling on 
the swiftly degenerating Walk The 
Moon to take a step back and make 
room for their young faces.

Action Bronson

What can be said about Vice food 

correspondent Action Bronson. Is 
he outrageous? Yes. Is he enraged? 
Definitely. By what, I’m still unsure, 
but I do know that watching him 
strut around Honda Stage as if 
he owned it, spitting verses and 
bringing out chef Mario Batali and 
other treasured guests was one of 
the most entertaining, breathtaking 
spectacles I’ve ever seen. He ran 
with hits like “Actin’ Crazy” and 
“Terry” while paying testament to 
his roots as a chef by hoisting an 
aluminum tray of food I can only 
assume was a three course meal 
he cooked himself. There was a 
watermelon given by a devout fan 
and a FaceTime call to his daughter. 
There was a question and an 
answer:

“What do you wanna hear?” 

Bronson asked.

“Baby blue, baby blue, baby blue,” 

hundreds of fans sang.

“What do you want me to do 

about it?” he spat in reply.

Big Grams

Big 
Boi 
and 
Phantogram, 

Phantogram 
and 
Big 
Boi. 
In 

2010, Big Boi posted a link to 
Phantogram’s 
single 
“Mouthful 

of Diamonds” on his website, and 
from there a collaboration involving 
Phantogram duo Sarah Barthel and 
Josh Carter was born. The music is 
groovy and smooth, with hip-hop 
stylings and electro pop influences 
respectively, but the majority of 
their performance sadly lacked 
this groove. A mix of the audience’s 
unfamiliarity with their music and 

a lack of charisma on the duo’s 
part made their stage presence less 
enticing than their debut album, 
not to mention an unsettling verse 
rapped by Carter during “Goldmine 
Junkie.” But as the set wound 
down, they finished with a mash-
up of Phantogram’s “Mouthful of 
Diamonds” and Outkast’s “Ms. 
Jackson,” a performance that didn’t 
need charisma or familiarity, only 
every audience member yelling “I 
didn’t mean to make your daughter 
cry.”

Father John Misty

Josh Tillman, goddamn Josh 

Tillman. This glorious man gave 
one of the most empowered, 
emphatic performances I have 
ever witnessed. His songs drip 
with vitriol and his stage presence 
drips with sex appeal as he 
unapologetically 
condemns 
his 

love life, his audience, himself 
and America song after song. He 
dances, jumps and runs off stage, 
even lying down at one point during 
“True 
Affection,” 
relaying 
the 

lyrics to the audience from that 
vantage point. At times like these, 
it seemed more like an exorcism 
than a catharsis, but then he would 
preach some godless verse and I’d 
be reassured that no greater power 
was involved other than the higher 
power that is the music industry 
itself. Three times some sweeping 
emotion caused his microphone 
stand to break, but Tillman never 
resigned to the roadie sent out to 
replace it; instead he simply pushed 
on. He moved with the beguile of a 
dancer, his body betraying feigned 
bashfulness 
and 
amusement 

through lyrics laced in satire. If 
Tillman was an actor, “Bored in 
the U.S.A.” was his Milton and 
“Holy Shit” was his Hamlet. If he 
was a god, the audience would be 
constructing shrines in his honor to 
the tune of “Chateau Lobby #4.”

Beck

He’s the cool uncle that never 

stopped 
being 
cool. 
He’s 
the 

45-year-old 
man 
who 
wears 

sunglasses 
and 
smokes 
Camel 

cigarettes in the shade, but no one 
says anything to him because he just 
can. He shows up on some religious 
holiday in a leather jacket and a 
motorcycle while your dad rolls his 
eyes because he secretly, no, openly 
resents the bachelor-pad lifestyle 
of his brother. This entire aesthetic 
is accepted by the hundreds of 
festival attendees who swarmed to 
the main stage for his incredibly 

packed set list, including hits like 
“Go It Alone,” “Mixed Bizness,” and 
“Sexx Laws” as well as a tribute to 
the recently deceased David Bowie 
with a cover of “China Girl” and 
Prince. Leading up to his rendition 
of “Raspberry Beret” he spilled his 
heart to the audience through his 
black tinted sunglasses and leather 
jacket about his relationship with 
Prince — a fleeting, but affecting 
one. Prince presented Beck with 
his Grammy for Best Album for 
Morning Phase, and in return, Beck 
seized his chance to hug Prince, an 
idol of his, without any indication 
of whether this was an O.K. move 
on Prince’s end. Not until watching 
the footage of the award ceremony 
afterwards was he reassured by the 
smile that stretched across Prince’s 
face, and thus delivered to the 
audience this day not one, but two 
tributes to this treasured idol.

Jamie xx

It’s hard to imagine In Colour 

playing outside of the solitariness 
of one’s headphones. Other than 
“There’s Going to Be (Good Times),” 
the breakout hit of the record and 
one of the finest Young Thug features 
out there, the music is something 
contained within one’s earbuds, 
enclosed in that narrow mental 
space. That was the case for me, at 
least, until I had to push my way 
through the swarms gathered under 
the Bacardi House Stage tent to see 
the breakout member of indie pop 
band The xx spin his records under 
flashing lights and witness an “All 
Under One Roof Raving” take place. 
He played popular tracks like “Loud 
Places” that brought shivers down 
the spine when accompanied by his 
remix of Florence + The Machine’s 
“You’ve Got The Love.” A remix of 
The Human League’s “Don’t You 
Want Me” was thrown in there too, 
along with a denouncement by the 
twenty-something in front of me 

who commented “Wasn’t this a hit 
in like 1986?” It was 1982, sir, and if 
Jamie xx can spin it, I don’t see what 
the year has to do with anything.

The Strokes

The crowd in front of the 

GOVBALL Main Stage stretched 
for miles. I’ve seen people before, 
even large amounts of them, but 
never so many together in close 
confines all progressively getting 
more and more impatient as the 
minutes dragged on. At 9:00, fifteen 
minutes before The Strokes were 
scheduled to go on, concert-goers 
were waiting in anticipation; at 9:15, 
their scheduled playing time, the 
island buzzed with energy; at 9:30, 
any movement behind the thick 
screen of smoke was greeted by 
shrieks and applause; at 9:45, there 
were riots narrowly avoided by 
Julian Casablancas and the rest of 
the band’s entrance. From there, the 
night took off into a frenzy of music 
as my middle school angst and 
unrequited attempts at edginess 
were relieved. Every other person 
in the crowd shouted in sync to 
the shrieks of guitar and somber 
words of Casablancas as they played 
hits like “The Modern Age,” “Last 
Nite” and “Someday” as well as 
songs from their four track feature 
released that day, such as “Threat 
of Joy” and “Drag Queen.” But 
somberness was far from the theme 
of the night for either The Strokes 
or audience members, and from this 
came the increasingly digressing 
ramblings of Casablancas and a 
beautiful rendition of The Clash’s 
“Clampdown,” a song they have not 
performed live in over ten years. 
With a conclusion of “You Only 
Live Once” as the encore, the crowd 
exploded in energy as it surged 
towards the stage wanting to savor 
the sounds of their adolescence and 
fleeting feelings of their youth.

Strokes’ latest a 
no-frills record

Band returns with 
much of the same in 

new EP

By MATT GALLATIN

Daily Arts Writer

For all the traditionalism and 

tropes that define The Strokes — 
taut guitars, catchy chords, and 
an 
over-the-

top 
rock 
‘n’ 

roll attitude — 
they too have 
been a sort of 
experiment for a 
new interaction 
between artists, 
the 
public, 

labels 
and 

critics. 
The 

explosion of the 
group in 2001 was propelled by a 
new millennial generation of rock 
writers and listeners. A shiny, new 
“indie” publication called Pitchfork 
would come, for better or worse, to 
define this new approach. Reviews 
became increasingly self-indulgent 
and personal — this band means 
something to me; this release is 
far too mainstream for me; look 
at all of these references I know. 
Naturally, music reviews are going 
to be subjective. Those who tell 
you a review can be completely 
techincal are kidding themselves. 
But this new brand of narcissism 
was, nevertheless, a sea change, 
and it was one The Strokes were 
pulled into gleefully by the culture, 
the band’s wishes — whatever they 
might have been — aside. And as it 
goes, it was in that sea The Strokes 
drowned, as critics who hailed 
the band started taking personal 
offense that they wouldn’t follow in 
the footsteps of their darling record 
Kid A.

And yet, despite the disdain, The 

Strokes have continued to dole out 
catchy, infectious, lasting singles 
from one decade to another. The 
usual complaint — they’re just 
rehashing the same material — is 
not necessarily ill-founded; it’s just 
irrelevant at this point. Fine, none 
of their material may ever match 
the beating heart of “Last Nite.” But 
the relentless pace of “Reptilia,” 
the shimmering chords of “You 

Only Live Once,” the pitch perfect 
“Under Cover of Darkness” and the 
jittery “One Way Trigger” endure 
well on their own merits, even if 
they’re not on a disc titled Is This It.

Accordingly, The Strokes have 

managed, after much discussion 
of their fate, to once again create a 
successful, bouncy, fun release.

It seems part of that success 

comes from a lesson in brevity. For 
the most part, The Strokes have 
always followed this rule, but it’s 
more obvious on Future Present 
Past than ever. There are only 
three new tracks included, with 
the addition of a remix of single 
“Oblivius” at the end.

Opener 
“Drag 
Queen” 
jolts 

the EP into pace with its dark 
guitar chords, and while a bit 
overambitious 
and 
scattered 

lyrically, it features a welcome 
revision of the guitar interplay 
that admittedly fell off in some 
of their later records. But it’s the 
original single here (per usual) 
that stands head and shoulders 
above everything else: “Oblivius.” 
It’s a towering work by the band 
and could be comfortably asserted 
as one of their very best in over 
a decade. The chorus resonates 
like nothing we’ve heard from the 
group in a while: “What side are 
you standing on?” It’s simple, to the 
point, and beautiful, which is not 
what would always be associated 
with Julian Casablancas’ nasally 
voice.

“Threat of Joy” is a more upbeat 

take, and it feels straight from Room 
on Fire - era. It’s less memorable 
than “Drag Queen” or “Oblivius,” 
but still a solid track front to back, 
disregarding the odd opening lines 
from Casablancas (“Ok / I see how 
it is now / you don’t have time to 
play with me anymore”).

The addition of the “Oblivius” 

remix by Moretti is an unnecessary 
and inescapably redundant one, but 
it’s a forgivable misstep given the 
length of the EP. It shifts the focus, 
rightly so, towards the single.

Are The Strokes changing the 

culture with Future Present Past, as 
they once did? Definitely not. Are 
they going to win the minds of long-
standing detractors? No. But if you 
want a straightforward, no-frills 
rock release, you can rely on The 
Strokes, like you always could.

tall trees or a picnic-friendly lawn. 
She emphasized she would not 
support an impossible park any 
more than she would a structurally 
unsound building.

However, Haber claimed that 

there is a layer of broken rock and 
cement below the surface of the 
parking lot that can be replaced 
with soil.

“When they poured the roof 

of the top of the first floor (of the 
parking structure) … they have 
filled in 18 to 24 inches of broken 
rock and cement on top of the top 
of the parking structure,” he said. 
“Those 24 inches to 18 inches of 
rock and cement, remove that, put 
in some dirt.”

He also said he intends to use 

the Freedom of Information Act 
to make his claim accessible to the 
public.

City 
Councilmember 
Kirk 

Westphal (D–Ward 2) implicitly 
countered 
Haber’s 
assertions, 

arguing 
the 
parking 
lot 
was 

destined to become a building 
through 
a 
transparent 
public 

process.

“Before I was involved in city 

government, I participated as a 
citizen in the Calthorpe process 
for downtown over 10 years ago,” 
Westphal said. “The state of that 
particular parcel has not been 
contentious at all for decades, so 
going to the voters about a single 
piece of property didn’t seem to be a 
good use of the ballot mechanism.”

He said there is a foundation for 

a high-rise building embedded in 
the underground parking structure 
as per an accepted budget proposal.

“The community decided all 

along that this was an appropriate 
place to put parking underground 
and a high rise above, so that’s 
why we invested in a foundation 
for a high-rise building,” Westphal 
said. “It was decided when the 
underground 
structure 
was 

proposed and approved, because 
the building wasn’t proposed on top 
of it at the time and a foundation for 
a large building can go in there.”

However, 
Haber 
dismissed 

Westphal’s suggestion that this 
foundation 
was 
agreed 
upon 

democratically. He claimed that 
when the underground parking 
lot was originally developed, the 
developer inserted backdoor costs 
for building high-rises in the 
future.

points. Morgan worked for the 
Clinton presidential campaign 
in 2008 and was a delegate for 
Clinton in that year’s Democratic 
National Convention. He said his 
experience working for a losing 
primary campaign makes him 
empathetic 
with 
present-day 

Sanders supporters.

“I’m very confident that, in the 

fall, when any rational person 
looks at the race between Hillary 
Clinton and Donald Trump, the 
choice will be very clear,” Morgan 
said. “With that said, the Clinton 
campaign has to do a good job of 
embracing Sanders’ supporters 
and incorporating a lot of the 
issues that they were passionate 
about.”

Both 
Morgan 
and 
Perkins 

said they intend to continue to 
organize for Clinton and will be 
coordinating with professional 
staff from the Clinton campaign 
once they arrive in the state. 
Perkins also acknowledged that 
Trump’s populist rhetoric could 
make Michigan more competitive 
than in past presidential elections.

“I do think Trump speaks to a 

‘we’ve been battered economically 
for so long’ and a ‘god damn it, 
that’s someone’s fault’ attitude,” 
Perkins said. “He can speak the 
sound bites of why Michigan is 
struggling financially, but it’s 
harder for (Clinton) because it’s 
not a soundbite.”

Despite the optimism of some 

local 
Clinton 
supporters 
for 

uniting the party by November, 
there is evidence of continued 
resistance 
from 
grassroots 

supporters of Sanders, particularly 
among the University community.

Rising LSA junior Nicholas 

Kolenda, president of the Ann 
Arbor chapter of Students for 
Sanders, estimated 40 percent of 

local Sanders supporters are ready 
to vote for Clinton in November, 
40 percent are undecided and 20 
percent have left the Democratic 
Party. Kolenda also said he 
and many of his fellow Sanders 
supporters are disappointed by 
the result of the primaries but 
have accepted Clinton as the 
nominee.

While he is not sure if he will 

organize for Clinton’s campaign 
in November, Kolenda said he 
will continue advocating for local 
elections and political causes, 
such as the upcoming contract 
negotiations for the University’s 
Graduate Student Union, which 
aims to ensure fair pay and 
benefits for graduate student 
instructors. He added that, while 
he and his peers have reservations 
about Clinton, they are firmly 
opposed to the prospect of a 
Trump presidency.

“My views on Clinton are 

lukewarm at best, so it’d be hard 
to take hours out of the day to do 
much for that campaign,” Kolenda 
said 
in 
an 
email 
interview. 

“However, myself, and others, 
will be trying my hardest to keep 
Trump out of office, and if the 
Students for Hillary or Campus 
Democrats groups need help to 
keep Michigan out of Trump’s 
hands, I’d be willing to help out.”

A few minutes after 9 p.m., 

the CNN broadcast on the bar’s 
flat-screen televisions declared 
Clinton the winner of the New 
Jersey primary, drawing cheers 
and applause from attendees.

Three minutes later, Trump 

appeared on the same screens. The 
commotion among the Clinton 
supporters dulled as they turned 
to the televisions. As he read from 
his teleprompter, Trump’s speech 
gradually drew laughs, eye-rolls, 
head-shakes — and, when the 
Republican nominee called for 
Sanders’ supporters to join him — 
boos.

National 
Toxicology 
Program 

released in May stated there is little 
potential for harm from cell phones. 
The study exposed rats and mice to 
frequencies similar to those used for 
mobile devices in the United States 
and found minimal instances of 
tumors in their subjects. 

On 
the 
other 
hand, 
the 

International Agency for Research 
on Cancer — a part of the World 
Health Organization — classified 
this cell phone radio-frequency 
energy as potentially carcinogenic 
after discovering an increased risk 
for glioma, a type of brain cancer, 
associated with cell phones.

Despite 
this 
contradictory 

evidence, Larry Junck, a University 
of Michigan professor of Neurology, 
does not think cell phones need 
warnings like other known harmful 
substances — such as cigarettes and 
alcohol — do. Junck additionally 
exhibited little concern for any 
health problems associated with cell 
phones.

“There’s not a lot of reason to 

think that the radio waves that are 
emitted by cell phones would be 
harmful to one’s body,” Junck said. 
“We all know that there’s radio 
waves all around us, and we don’t 
think of them as being harmful. One 
of the main ways that radio waves 

or micro waves could be harmful is 
by actually heating tissues, and that 
doesn’t occur to a significant extent 
with routine use of cell phones.”

Junck particularly focuses on 

brain tumors and glioma treatment 
in his work, and he was recently 
featured in a Wall Street Journal 
article regarding his stance on cell 
phone warnings. He said there are 
not enough studies to accurately 
link brain tumors to an increase in 
cell phone use, as the phones’ radio 
waves do not damage DNA and 
pass through tissues without harm. 
He added that the increase in brain 
tumors since the 1970s is due to an 
advance in detection technology, not 
cell phones. 

“If this (cell phones) was a major 

cause of brain tumors, you would 
expect to see brain tumors becoming 
more common,” Junck said. “It’s 
widely believed the increase in brain 
tumors is due to better recognition 
of brain tumors by more widespread 
use of MRI scans and CT scans.”

The World Health Organization 

also reported after its 2010 study 
that, despite an increased use in 
cell phones, newer phones also 
have lower energy emissions, and 
the increased use in texting keeps 
the head distanced from phones, 
concluding that more studies are 
necessary to gauge how harmful cell 
phones are. 

Junck said many studies that 

report positive links between brain 

tumors and cell phone usage have 
underlying biases. For example, if 
researchers ask individuals who 
already have a brain tumor about 
their cell phone use patterns, they 
may assume their tumor was caused 
by their cell phone use and report 
higher rates of usage. 

Junck added that the trend in the 

number of brain tumor incidents is 
not explained by the increased cell 
phone use. 

“If using a cell phone was the 

cause of brain tumors and if it 
didn’t take much time for cell phone 
radiation to cause a brain tumor, 
then the incidents of brain tumors 
should have gone up in parallel 
with the increased prevalence of 
cell phones,” Junck said. “If it took a 
number of years of cell phone use to 
cause brain tumors, then you would 
expect the incidents of brain tumors 
to go up with the lag time several 
years later before the increase of 
brain tumors would be seen. Neither 
of those have taken place.”

Junck said, despite a lack of 

evidence, he sees merit in the claim 
that younger people would be more 
at risk than adults. 

“If there is going to be a concern, 

it would be especially important 
in kids — first of all, because they 
have more years of exposure, and 
secondly because their growing 
and developing tissues could be 
more susceptible to environmental 
harms,” Junck said.

from Michigan Department of 
Transportation and the Federal 
Railroad Administration should 
be released to the public to ensure 
there would be no misinformation 
during the community input phase.

“The harm of a premature 

release is that the city is releasing 
something when it’s not sure of 
its accuracy — the public would 
be commenting on something 
that may be false,” Taylor said. “I 
believe putting out a document 
that does not have its own stamp of 
internal confidence is a harm.”

Ackerman and Grand opposed 

the resolution by arguing that 
an early disclosure of the report 
would potentially undermine city 
staff as well as MDOT and the 
FRA.

“We need to dot our I’s and cross 

our T’s,” Ackerman said. “And 
after that, there will be a robust, 
there will be a long, there will be a 
lengthy public process.”

reaction to the recent shootings 
at the University of California at 
Los Angeles.

In the past, faculty members 

were 
encouraged 
to 
follow 

the “run, hide, fight” mantra 
in 
handling 
active 
shooter 

situations, 
Ortega 
said. 
He 

expressed 
concern 
that 
this 

rhetoric is outdated and rarely 
applicable 
to 
emergency 

situations. Ortega worried that 

prior training forced faculty 
members to prioritize issues of 
perceived liability over conscious 
decision making.

“Am I expected to run if I 

have a student in a wheelchair?” 
Ortega said. “I was concerned 
about the real expectations, 
especially 
when 
you 
have 

excessively challenged students.”

In response, Schultz suggested 

that YouTube videos could be 
used as effective tools in training 
students and faculty members 
in how to respond to an active 
shooter emergency.

Michigan exits from WCWS with 1-0 loss

After World 
Series loss, a 

fitting goodbye for 

Michigan

OKLAHOMA 
CITY, 

Okla. — Led by its coach, 
the Michigan softball team 
walked 
one-by-one, 
red-

eyed, 
into 

the 
bowels 

of ASA Hall 
of 
Fame 

Stadium.

It was all quiet but for the 

occasional sniffle as coach 
Carol 
Hutchins, 
senior 

second 
baseman 
Sierra 

Romero, junior right-hander 
Megan Betsa and senior right-
fielder Kelsey Susalla seated 
themselves at the front end 
of the press conference room 
before answering questions.

A magical run last season 

that ended with a runner-
up finish set expectations as 
high as they’ve ever been for 
Michigan this time around, 
which is not easy feat when 
you consider the program 
has made it to Oklahoma 
City more times than you can 
count on each hand.

And though the second-

ranked 
Wolverines 
failed 

to go as far as they did last 
season, losing 1-0 to Florida 
State in an elimination game, 
Hutchins still wanted her 
players to keep their heads up 
high.

“I’ve 
got 
a 
lot 
of 

heartbroken kids, a fantastic 
senior class that has to say 
goodbye, and I told them just 
to reflect on their careers, 
what 
they’ve 
meant 
to 

Michigan and what Michigan 
has meant to them,” Hutchins 
said. “We’ll hold our heads 
high at the end of the day, 
because they represent this 
institution and the sport of 
softball. They represent their 
families every day the way 
our institution asks them to 
do it. They’re great Michigan 
women.

“As a coach, ultimately 

that’s what I’m most proud of. 
I’ll always be proud of Team 
39. They’ve had a great season 
and we had a great run, and 
unfortunately, we just ran out 
(of gas) at the end.”

After the loss, Michigan 

didn’t talk about what-ifs. 
It didn’t talk about what 
should’ve 
been. 
Instead, 

Hutchins and the Wolverines 
focused on all that they were 
able to accomplish.

“We 
set 
really 
high 

expectations for our student-
athletes, and if you’re going 

to wear the Block M, you’re 
going to wear it right,” 
Hutchins said. “You’re going 
to learn the minute you 
walk in the door that this 
isn’t about you, this is about 
Michigan. Your job, your duty 
and the reason we bring you 
to Michigan and give you the 
opportunity of your lifetime 
is to help make Michigan 
great, and our kids embraced 
that and they epitomize it.

“This senior class has 

done nothing but both of 
those things. They have 
done nothing but represent 
Michigan. I’m very, very 
proud of that.”

Before Sunday, Michigan 

had rebounded with a win 
after every loss this season. 
But after Amanda Vargas’s 
foul 
pop-up 
was 
caught 

for the final out and the 
Seminoles 
streamed 
onto 

the field to celebrate, there 
were no more chances for 
the Wolverines to redeem 
themselves, 
leaving 
them 

reduced to a 52-7 record with 
no ring to show.

And on one of the hardest 

days of their lives, with their 
hearts in pieces, Michigan 
reminded its fans — and its 
coach — why it loved them 
to begin with. They stopped 
crying, and instead, they 
signed autographs.

ORION 
SANG

2016 was 

supposed to be 
the Wolverines’ 
year to win it all

OKLAHOMA 
CITY, 

Okla. — The 2016 season 
was supposed to be the 
year the No. 2 Michigan 
softball 
team 
would 
win 
its 

second 
Women’s College World 
Series championship. It 
returned 
nearly 
every 

player from 2015 runner-
up squad, losing just left-
hander 
Haylie 
Wagner 

and catcher Lauren Sweet 
from their core lineup. 

Record-setting seniors 

Sierra Romero and Sierra 
Lawrence led the top of the 
lineup with potent power 
and 
blistering 
speed. 

Lawrence had a career-
setting season with new 
highs in batting average, 
on-base-percentage 
and 

slugging percentage.

Meanwhile, 
Romero 

dominated 
conference 

play, too. She earned Big 
Ten Player of the Year and 
her first-ever USA Softball 
Player of the Year award in 
her third consecutive time 
as a top-three finalist. 
Romero was named as a 
NFCA All-America first-
team member for the third 
straight year.

Senior 
right 
fielder 

Kelsey Susalla had another 
solid year in the cleanup 
spot, hitting .344 with 11 
home runs. Susalla earned 
her 
second 
consecutive 

spot on the NFCA All-
Great Lakes region First-
Team.

This was the Wolverines’ 

season to win it all. They 
had the player of the year 
in Romero, the Big Ten 
coach of the year and 
NCAA’s most winningest 
coach in Carol Hutchins, 
the Big Ten Pitcher of 
the year in junior right-
hander Megan Betsa and 
four players earning All-

American accolades. This 
was Michigan’s time to 
shine, until it wasn’t.

The top scoring team 

in the country, with 8.61 
runs per game, crossed 
the plate just seven times 
in its three WCWS games 
— a 2.33 average. Romero, 
the team leader in batting 
average, home runs, RBI 
and nearly every other 
offensive category went 
1-for-7 
in 
the 
WCWS 

with the same amount of 
strikeouts as RBI (one). 
Lawrence 
wasn’t 
much 

better, hitting two singles 
in nine at-bats.

Team 39 was a team 

saddled with expectations. 
At the team’s Media Day in 
February, the Wolverines 
answered questions about 
a possible 
postseason 
rematch 
with 
No. 

1 
Florida. 

Michigan 
made 
it 

further 
than 
the 

Gators 
— 
who 

were upset in the Super 
Regionals — but not as far 
as last season.

There were bright spots 

in this year’s lineup, giving 
optimism for next season. 
Sophomore first baseman 
Tera 
Blanco 
cemented 

herself as the team’s next 
dynamic hitter, slugging 
12 home runs and 66 
RBI 
while 
posting 
a 

.409/.758/.540 slash line. 
She will look to build on 
this year’s success as the 
likely-cleanup hitter next 
spring. 

Junior 
left 
fielder 

Kelly Christner couldn’t 
match her other-worldly 
sophomore year numbers, 
but 
she 
still 
provided 

a 
.320 
average 
and 

tremendous energy both 
at the plate and on the 
field as a team captain. 
And of course, Betsa will 
return for her senior year. 
Betsa so often stymied her 
opponents from the circle, 
holding them to a career-
low .162 batting average 
and striking out 302 of 

them. With the exception 
of Romero, the rest of the 
infield will return next 
season, but Christner will 
be the only outfield starter 
back.

The 2016 softball season 

was one with tremendous 
potential that ultimately 
fell 
short. 
Mistakes 

defensively 
behind 
the 

plate, a dearth of pitching 
depth and a lack of timely 
hitting cost the Wolverines 
another trip to the WCWS 
championship.

“My time here has been 

awesome,” 
Susalla 
said 

after Michigan’s 1-0 loss 
to Florida State on Sunday. 
“This last year with 20 
other other girls was just 
amazing. We didn’t get the 
outcome that we wanted, 

but 
I 

wouldn’t 
have 
traded 
these last 
three 
days 
for 

anything.”

In 
the 

last 
four 

years, 

Michigan has won 210 
games. It won the Big Ten 
in each of those seasons, 
it reached the finals of the 
WCWS, but one task still 
eluded 
the 
Wolverines’ 

senior class: the chance to 
hold the WCWS trophy.

“It’s 
really 
hard 
to 

get to the World Series,” 
Hutchins said. “It’s really 
hard to win at the World 
Series. And honestly, I’m 
just proud of our kids for 
the season they’ve had. 
It doesn’t always go your 
way. That’s how life goes.

“This has been a — this 

is a tough group. We made 
them tough by what we do 
every day, and regardless 
of the final outcome here, 
they toughed through all 
those things. ... We were 
close to winning it last 
night without our best 
performance. This is a 
really tough group.”

A tough group that had 

everything — everything 
but a performance worthy 
of 
winning 
a 
WCWS 

championship.

others across the 
country, it was his 
best. Michigan even broke into 
the preseason rankings at No. 15 
and was projected to win the Big 
Ten by many.

But even after a blistering hot 

start to the season, the Wolverines 
finished 36-21 after a 2-9 stretch 
that ended the season with a 
disappointing early exit from the 
Big Ten Tournament — and no 
spot in the NCAA Regionals.

Nevertheless, the season was 

not completely lost. Plenty of 
thrilling games and outstanding 
individual 
performances 
kept 

Michigan baseball as exciting 
as ever in its 150th season of 
existence.

Here are The Daily’s end of the 

season awards:

Season high: Ako Thomas’ 

walk-off 
against 
Michigan 

State on April 29

By 
the 
end 

of 
April, 
a 

conference 
win 
against 

Michigan’s 
biggest 
in-state 

rival was sorely 
needed 
after 

losing 
to 
the 

Spartans 
11-5 

in the two teams’ first matchup 
of the year. This time around, 
though, it was the freshman 
infielder Ako Thomas delivered 
for the then-sixteenth ranked 
Wolverines in the 11th inning. 
He singled with two outs in the 
frame, scoring sophomore catcher 
Drew Lugbauer from second, who 
beat the throw home. Featuring 
the marquee starting pitchers 
for both squads, it was by far 
the biggest win the Wolverines 
racked this season.

Season low: Michigan loses 

to Central Michigan, 8-7 in Mt. 
Pleasant

At the time, a May 11 road 

loss 
against 
the 
middling 

Central Michigan seemed to be 
just a bump in the road after a 

dominating 
weekend 
sweep 
of 

Rutgers, 
but 

it 
turned 

out to be the 
beginning 
of 
the 

Wolverines’ 
late-season 
demise. 
The 

biggest loss of 
the game was 

senior outfielder Matt Ramsay, 
who suffered a season-ending 
injury. His absence was felt in a 
big way for the remainder of the 
season.

Most exciting win: Michigan 

beats Hawaii 5-4 in 10 innings 
on March 11

It was the Wolverines’ first 

late-inning test of the season, 
and it ended in dramatic fashion. 
A packed Les Marakami Stadium 
in Honolulu was as “loud as a 
stadium can get” according to 
Bakich, and Michigan certainly 
felt the pressure. After cruising 
to a 4-1 lead on a seven-inning, 
12-strikeout 
performance 
by 

junior left-hander Brett Adcock, 
Hawaii came roaring back in the 
ninth. To stop Hawaii’s rally, 
Lugbauer made a behind-the-
back toss to sophomore right-

hander Bryan 
Pall to tag a 
runner out at 
the plate, and 
keep the game 
4-4. Michigan 
won, 5-4, on 
an RBI from 
junior catcher 
Harrison 

Wenson in the 10th inning.

Best individual performance: 

Matt Ramsay on April 1 against 
Northwestern

Bakich says he hasn’t seen 

a performance like this in 20 
years, 
so 
Ramsay’s 
definitely 

tops the list. In the midst of the 
Wolverines’ 
longest 
winning 

streak of the season, Michigan 
crushed 
Northwestern, 
12-3, 

thanks to three home runs from 
Ramsay. On the day, he was 5-for-
6 with seven RBIs to contribute to 

the Wolverines 21-hit effort.

Most Valuable Player: Brett 

Adcock

The junior left-hander was 

the 
Wolverines’ 
horse 
all 

year, and held opponents to a 
.190 batting average. He had 
several signature performances 

throughout the season. Against 
University of Illinois – Chicago, 
he threw a complete game 
shutout. In a road contest against 
Illinois, he threw 8.1 innings of 
three-hit baseball as Michigan 
won 1-0 — Michigan’s only win 
in an eight-game stretch to end 

the regular season. Though he 
struggled with his command 
at times, Adcock tallied 100 
strikeouts on the season, good 
for fifth in Michigan history. He 
holds a 3.09 career earned-run 
average, which ranks fifth in 
program history.

MATT VAILLIENCOURT/Daily

Right-hander Brett Adcock tallied seven wins and held opponents to a .190 average in his junior campaign. 

The Wolverines 

lost 9 of their 

final 11 games of 

the season.

Matt Ramsay 
hit three home 

runs April 1.

Misterwives

The 
energetic 
equivalent 
of 

the previous day’s Years & Years, 
Misterwives presented the piercing 
vocals of the female frontman 
Mandy 
Lee 
and 
her 
endless 

encouragement and positivity that 
prefaced every song. It’s nice to 
hear, every once in awhile, that I 
can accomplish my dreams, even 
if those dreams are only vaguely 
defined in the back of my mind. 
Regardless, the alt-pop band went 
through the rounds of their hits and 
singles in a hometown performance, 
as well as presenting new material 
in their hour-long set on Saturday in 
between shouts of encouragement 
and thanks as Lee ran around stage 
belting high notes. The energy in 
the air was never more electric than 
when they performed “Reflections” 
and “Our Own House” and, despite 
unfamiliarity 
with 
the 
songs, 

never was it lacking as she led the 
audience through lyrics and refrains 
as a strive towards inclusivity. 
Misterwives’ brand of alt-pop is 
the guilty pleasure kind, the kind 
that makes you want to dance, but 
crippling insecurity directs you 
towards the sadder, hipper music 
instead. It’s the kind that makes 
you want to run, but self-doubt and 

unathleticism prevents that from 
happening.

Lord Huron

For the three years I’ve listened 

to Lord Huron, I’ve recommended 
them to friends and family and even 
included their discography on my 
“Should I Read or Should I Cry?” 
playlist alongside Bob Dylan’s. For 
three years I have alternatively 
referred to them with the pronouns 
“he” or “them” interchangeably, for, 
despite my devotion to their music, 
I never truly knew if Lord Huron 
was an individual or a band. Forget 
the internet. That wouldn’t solve 
my problem. Only running toward 
the main stage on Saturday, toward 
their scheduled performance, would 
end the years of self-doubt. And it 
turned out to be a four-piece, all-
male band, with a name inspired by 
the great lake itself who didn’t fail 
to impress. Their music is melodic 
and pure, leaning towards the folk 
genre but not in the same vein as 
The Lumineers. If there was a way 
a midwestern field or a gust of wind 
could be captured in music, it would 
be captured by Lord Huron in slow-
building songs like their hits “Time 
to Run” and “Ends of the Earth,” but 
also in more fast-paced songs like 
“Hurricane (Johnnie’s Theme).

TV REVIEW
‘Feed the Beast’ uneasy 
mix of crime and food

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Considering 
AMC 
holds 
a 

relatively 
high 
standard 
after 

producing 
three 
critically 

acclaimed 
series 
— 

“Mad Men,” 
“Breaking 
Bad” 
and 

“The 
Walking 
Dead” — it 
makes sense 
why “Feed 
the 
Beast” 

has received 
dismal 
reviews. Based on the Danish TV 
show “Bankerot” and developed 
by “Dexter” showrunner Clyde B. 
Phillips, “Feed the Beast” is missing 
the “it” factor that made those 
three aforementioned programs so 
successful and distinctive among 
the rest of television. In the show, 
there aren’t any colorful yet deeply 

flawed characters, slow-burning 
drama or tantalizing dialogue — at 
least not yet.

While 
“Feed 
the 
Beast” 

possesses some potential as a fast-
paced melodrama, it suffers from 
middling writing, wooden acting 
and a lack of chemistry between 
its two leads. Jim Sturgess (“Across 
the Universe”) overperforms as 
the 
arrogant, 
cocaine-snorting 

chef Dion Patras, who gets out of 
prison after setting his restaurant 
on fire. His former partner Tommy 
Moran 
(David 
Schwimmer, 

“American Crime Story: The People 
v. O.J. Simpson”) is an alcoholic 
sommelier-turned-wine-rep 
and 

recent widow, his deceased wife 
Rie (Christine Adams, “Pushing 
Daisies”) having been part of the 
duo’s restaurant business. Together, 
Tommy and Dion are (apparently) a 
great team, but tensions and past 
mistakes immediately fuel friction 
between the two once they reunite.

In terms of its plot, “Feed the 

Beast” can actually make for 
an 
engaging, 
ambitious 
story. 

However, the first episode, aptly 
titled “Pilot Light,” doesn’t ignite 
a strong enough fuse to set the 
story in motion. Within the first 10 
minutes of “Feed the Beast,” there’s 
already a lot going on, especially 
because it involves sex, drugs 
and even some violence to boot. 
After being released from prison, 
Dion soon finds trouble when he 
attempts to outrun an angry mob 
boss named Patrick “The Tooth 
Fairy” Woichick (Michael Gladis, 
“Mad Men”), to whom he owes 
money. Despite Gladis’ best efforts, 
his character remains bereft of 
any personality or threatening 
presence, being a bland villain with 
a ridiculous nickname — is there 
anything more menacing-sounding 
than “The Tooth Fairy”?

Meanwhile, a sullen, wine-

drinking Tommy attempts to be a 
caring single parent to his only son 
T.J. (newcomer Elijah Jacob), who 
has become silent after witnessing 
his mother’s tragic death. T.J. is 
the most interesting character so 
far on “Feed the Beast,” not just 
because he doesn’t utter a single 
line of dialogue, but also because 
his quietness provides an authentic 
firmness to the show’s shaky 
emotional 
core. 
Schwimmer’s 

dramatic 
chops-portraying 

lookalike and O.J.’s ex-confidant 
Robert Kardashian on “American 
Crime Story” were decent enough 
and are again on display in “Feed 
the Beast.” However, Schwimmer’s 
individual performance struggles 
to develop his troubled character 
into 
something 
profound 
and 

three-dimensional. 
Similarly, 

Sturgess resorts to making Dion 
into a loathsome, hot-headed chef 
stereotype, like Bradley Cooper in 
“Burnt” or Catherine Zeta-Jones 
in “No Reservations.” His scenes 
with Schwimmer also feel as 
disconnected as their characters — 
the two flatly and often unnaturally 
delivering lines to one another — as 
if Schwimmer and Sturgess were 
just placed next to one another 
having met only a minute before 
shooting.

Other than T.J., the most 

intriguing aspect of “Feed the 
Beast” is the food itself. Thanks to 
some sumptuous cinematography 
and stylized, quick-cut editing, the 
food made on the show is almost too 
savory and mouth-watering to look 
at. There’s a great fantasy scene at 
one point, where Dion holds up 
a plate and describes an eclectic 
dish of grilled octopus topped 
with cherry tomatoes, which only 
Tommy (and the viewer) sees. In a 
later sequence, after a spontaneous 
moment of inspiration, Dion cooks 
up some heavenly pasta for Tommy 
and T.J., a sweet gesture that 
highlights the duo’s complicated, 
close relationship, only for a fleeting 
moment. 

Unlike other AMC first-season 

competitors “Preacher” and “The 
Night Manager,” “Feed the Beast” 
hasn’t found its footing right away. 
It bounces around thematically 
and tonally, juggling between a 
mediocre crime subplot, a character 
study on grief and loss and a food-
centric story about the cut-throat 
environment of high-class cooking. 
At the moment, “Feed the Beast” 
seems unsure of itself, focusing 
on which of the three storylines 
could be the strongest, instead of 
how each storyline can prove to be 
compelling on their own, as well as 
blending easily with one another. If 
you come hungry before watching 
“Feed the Beast,” don’t expect to be 
full by the end.
