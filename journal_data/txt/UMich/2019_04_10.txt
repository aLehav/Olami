When 
LSA 
sophomore 
Aidan Sova transferred from 
Michigan State University this 
school year, he didn’t expect 
an increase in his cost of living. 
Sova, who self-identifies as a 
student of low socioeconomic 
status, said upon his arrival to 
campus, the major economic 
disparities between students at 
University of Michigan became 
abundantly clear to him.
Sova is an associate director 
of the Association of Big Ten 
Students, a forum for student 
representatives from each Big 
Ten college to address student 
needs and concerns. He served 
on 
student 
government 
at 

Michigan State and was on 
Michigan’s 
Central 
Student 
Government 
Executive 
Team as a policy adviser last 
semester. 

Journalists 
convened 
in 
Haven Hall Tuesday afternoon 
for a panel to discuss the 
representation 
of 
Latinx 
issues, perspectives and voices 
in 
American 
journalism. 
More than 50 students and 
faculty attended the event, 
which featured two Knight-
Wallace fellows, Luis Trelles 
and Aaron Nelsen, and two 
local journalists from Detroit, 
Serena Maria Daniels and 
Sarah Alvarez.
The 
University 
of 
Michigan 
Latina/o 
Studies 
Program hosted the panel, in 

collaboration 
with 
Wallace 
House and the Department of 
American Culture. Larry La 
Fountain-Stokes, the interim 
director of the Latina/o Studies 
Program in the Department 
of American Culture, was the 
main organizer behind the 
event.
“This event came about as a 
collaboration with the Wallace 
House to take advantage of 
the fact that so many of the 
fellows this year were either 
Latino or Latina, or covering 
topics pertaining to Latinos or 
Latinas in the United States,” 
La Fountain-Stokes said.
With 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
administration’s 

focus on immigration laws 
and 
the 
president’s 
often 
generalized negative remarks 
towards 
the 
Mexican 
population, 
La 
Fountain-
Stokes noted the relevance 
of this panel in the current 
political climate. 
“This is a complex, historical 
moment 
to 
be 
covering 
Latino/a people and Latin 
America,” La Fountain-Stokes 
said. “You could argue that it 
is a hostile environment.”
The panel opened with 
a discussion of the term 
“Latino.” According to Trelles, 
despite its common usage by 
media outlets and in news 
articles, it generalizes the 

diversity of Latin America and 
glosses over the cultural and 
regional differences. 
“Latino issues — It can be 
a very convenient label for 
politicians and for marketing, 
but very often the issues that 
affect 
a 
third 
generation 
Puerto Rican from the Bronx 
are very different from the 
issues that affect Cubanos in 
South Florida,” Trelles said.
Kinesiology 
sophomore 
Kim Morales is a member of La 
Casa and identifies as Latinx. 
She said she found the panel to 
be a fresh take on the modern 
discourse 
surrounding 
the 
Latinx identity.

Shake Shack is set to shake up 
the fast food scene in Ann Arbor. 
The company will be opening an 
Ann Arbor location in fall 2019, 
according to an email statement 
from the burger chain. This will 
be Shake Shack’s third location in 
Michigan, joining one in downtown 
Detroit and another in Troy.
The New York-based burger and 
shake restaurant will be located 
at 3030 Washtenaw Ave. #107 in 
the Arbor Hills shopping center, 
replacing Brooks Brothers. The 
restaurant will occupy more than 
3,000 square feet of Arbor Hills 
including outdoor seating, Shake 
Shack said. The city of Ann Arbor 
approved the permits for the space, 
which will include structural, 
plumbing, electric and mechanical 
alterations which is estimated to 
cost $575,000, according to city 
records.
In an email to The Daily, 
Shake Shack spokeswoman Meg 
Castranova said the menu will 
consist of “Shack classics” like 
the 
ShackBurger, 
crinkle-cut 
fries, shakes and frozen custard 
concretes.

A Residence Halls Association’s 
assembly resolution to compensate 
its executive board has prompted 
criticism 
from 
the 
executive 
branch 
of 
the 
LSA 
Student 
Government.
The resolution was approved 
by RHA on April 4 with 27 out of 
30 members in favor. If approved 
by the director of housing, 
$20,700 of RHA funds will be 
earmarked 
as 
compensation 
for its seven-member executive 
board.
An April 8 executive statement 
from 
LSA 
SG 
affirmed 
the 
organization supports the goal 
behind compensating executive 
board members as the proposal 
removes financial barriers for 
students interested in joining 
the board. However, LSA SG 
executives 
feel 
the 
problem 
lies with the fact that the 
compensation would come from 
the RHA funds, which are largely 
collected through student fees.
LSA SG President Brian Wang, 
an LSA junior, said students pay 
$24.75 in student fees that are 
allocated to the RHA.

The University of Michigan 
will 
begin 
offering 
optional 
active 
attacker 
training 
to 
students, 
faculty, 
staff 
and 
community members through 
a 
program 
called 
“Capable 
Guardian: Instruct, Evacuate, 
Shelter, Defend.” The training 
is provided through the safety 
and security company Threat 
Suppression Incorporated and 
will be implemented by the 
Division of Public Safety and 
Security.
Melissa Overton, deputy chief 
of police and public information 
officer, said Capable Guardian 
does not yet have an estimated 
start date. She said the program 

will 
work 
to 
address 
the 
“in-between” area that often 
occurs as a result of active 
attacker protocol.
“What we do, or what we’re 
going to begin doing, is that 
in-between — what is the role 
of the staff member at the 
University, with a classroom of 
staff?” Overton said. “We started 
with the areas of concern based 
on experience and educating 
the 
community 
that 
require 
attention.”
According 
to 
the 
Threat 
Suppression website, the “run, 
hide, fight” mantra employed by 
the Department of Homeland 
Security 
as 
active 
attacker 
protocol has been found to cause 
uncertainty that may lead to the 
spread of inaccurate or vague 

information. 
The 
University 
utilizes the “run, hide, fight” 
mantra 
as 
active 
attacker 
protocol.
After unfounded reports of 
an active shooter in Mason Hall 
surfaced on March 16, many 
community members expressed 
concern regarding the clarity of 
the “run, hide, fight” protocol. 
LSA 
senior 
Brad 
Ebenhoeh, 
who uses a wheelchair, said he 
was not previously informed of 
protocol in an active attacker 
situation, nor was he informed of 
how individuals with disabilities 
should approach the protocol.
“It has been three weeks since 
the active shooter false claim, 
and I still don’t know what to 
do,” Ebenhoeh said. “That is 
unacceptable in my eyes.”
However, Overton said this 
situation did not factor into 
the decision to implement the 
Capable Guardian program at 
the University. DPSS Officer 
Matt Butzky, who brought 
the program to the attention 
of DPSS, said he first became 
aware of Threat Suppression 
and 
Mike 
Clumpner, 
its 
president 
and 
CEO, 
after 
attending a one-day training 
session on joint public safety 
response 
to 
active 
shooter 
events in early 2016. 
“Dr. 
Clumpner 
was 
particularly impressive in that 
session because so much of his 
information was supported by 
data and he was on the leading 
edge of the joint response 
concept 
to 
active 
shooter 
incidents,” Butzky said. “Later, 
I sought him out after we 
identified a couple areas in 
which we wanted to provide 
more 
specific 
information 
on active attacker response, 
building on the ‘run, hide, fight’ 
model already in place.”
Overton said DPSS hosted a 
three-day training by Clumpner 
March 6-8 of this year, which 

was planned more than a year 
prior.
The program will primarily 
focus 
on 
one’s 
position 
in 
an active attacker situation, 
Overton 
said. 
DPSS 
will 
also include a new module 
in the program that focuses 
specifically on the safety of 
people with disabilities in the 
event of an active attacker. This 
area does not currently exist in 
the Capable Guardian program.
“Our 
community 
members 
are in a role, either by their job 
title 
or 
personal 
conviction, 
where they would be unable to 
leave a vulnerable population or 
those which they are charged 
with 
leading 
or 
protecting, 
and also community members 
that have a disability or how to 
better prepare them within the 
framework of the ‘run, hide, 
fight’ model,” Overton said. “So 
these are both two areas that 
we’re going to be working on 
the community with, and it’s 
basically just training, educating 
and exercising so that they know 
what to do and how to respond to 
an active attacker.”
Threat Suppression defines 
capable guardians as “people 
within organizations to which 
others would immediately look 
to for guidance during an active 
shooter event.” According to the 
Threat Suppression website, the 
presentation will focus on many 
important components of the 
capable guardian concept.
“To understand how to manage 
people during times of duress, 
the participants are taught about 
the concepts of mass hysteria and 
crowd contagion,” the site reads. 
“The participants are also taught 
about research-based findings 
of 
human 
behavior 
during 
times of crises. The behavior 
is often dependent on several 
factors. One mitigating factor 
is the presence of a competent, 
identified, capable guardian.”

SCRE AM FOR (FRE E) ICE CRE AM

ON THE DAILY: U-M TO PURCHASE RENEWABLE ENERGY FROM DTE ENERGY

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: REGENTS MAY REFUSE 
HONORARY DEGREE TO MANDELA

The University of Michigan 
will purchase renewable energy 
annually from DTE Energy, a 
Detroit-based firm, starting in 
2021. University officials say DTE 
will provide about half of the 
purchased electricity on the Ann 

Arbor campus. This will offer a 
significant step toward reducing 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions, 
according to the University. 
The University will purchase 
approximately 200,000 megawatt 
hours 
of 
renewable 
energy 
annually 
from 
the 
company. 
University officials say this move 
will contribute to the University’s 

2025 greenhouse gas reduction 
goal of reducing GHG emissions 
25 percent below 2006 levels.
Climate change activists have 
raised concerns regarding the 
placement of DTE’s vice president 
of corporate strategy Camilo 
Serna on University President 
Mark Schlissel’s commission to 
develop 
recommendations 
for 

achieving sustainability.
The purchase follows the Global 
Climate Strike and a number of 
sit-ins by climate activists at the 
Fleming Administration Building, 
which 
houses 
a 
number 
of 
administration offices. Activists 
aim to get Schlissel to agree to a 
public, unfiltered and student-
moderated town hall.

April 9, 1986
Jailed South African leader 
Nelson Mandela will probably 
not receive an honorary degree at 
the University’s commencement 
ceremony next month because a 
Board of Regents bylaw prohibits 
giving an honorary degree “in 
absentia.”
In addition, a member of the 
University’s 
honorary 
degree 

committee, who refused to be 
identified, said the regents, in a 
closed session in January, rejected 
the 
panel’s 
recommendation 
that Raoul Wallenberg be given 
an honorary degree, because 
Wallenberg would be unable to 
accept the honor in person.
Wallenberg, 
a 
former 
University 
student, 
who 
saved the lives of hundreds of 

thousands of Hungarian Jews 
in Nazi Germany, disappeared 
shortly after World War II. He is 
believed to be dead. 
Mandela, 
a 
black 
South 
African, has been in prison since 
1962, serving a life sentence for 
leading the revolution against 
the nation’s white regime. He is 
recognized as a symbol of the 
anti-apartheid movement in his 

country.
A 
group 
of 
University 
students called the Free South 
Africa Coordinating Committe 
(FSACC) has been urging the 
University to give Mandela the 
degree. 
One of the reasons the group 
constructed a shanty on the 
Diag was to draw attention to its 
request that Mandela be honored.

‘Capable Guardian’ program offers 
training on active shooter response

DPSS provides optional instruction to students, faculty on ‘run, hide, fight’

ZAYNA SYED
Daily Staff Reporter 

Capable Guardian participants 
will learn about crisis theories 
that help explain how crisis 
events 
follow 
similar 
and 
predictable paths. The program 
will also include active attacker 
training 
and 
focus 
on 
the 
participant’s role in a situation as 
a capable guardian.
Butzky said DPSS hopes to 
incorporate the Capable Guardian 
concept 
as 
a 
supplemental 
module to the “run, hide, fight” 
information already being shared 
on campus for those who may 
want more information on what 
actions they can take.
“It’s 
important 
for 
those 
that are willing to take on that 
additional risk to have confidence 
in their knowledge, ability, and 
authority,” Butzky said. “The 
presentation 
(by 
Clumpner) 
was 
also 
valuable 
to 
DPSS 
administration as it clarified 
the role of security personnel 
in 
active 
attacker 
incidents. 
Similarly, we hope to build out 
another module that provides 

more specific information for 
those with disabilities.”
According 
to 
Overton, 
students, 
staff, 
faculty 
and 
community members will be able 
to sign up for the program through 
the DPSS website. A community 
outreach officer will then make 
contact 
with 
the 
interested 
individual and set up the training. 
Overton said she believes offering 
Capable Guardian is moving the 
University in the right direction.
Ebenhoeh said he is in support 
of the implementation of the 
program. He said he hopes the 
University will properly address 
the 
safety 
of 
people 
with 
disabilities in the program, as 
he has still not been informed 
of protocol following the false 
reports.
“If people do it, I am for it,” 
Ebenhoeh said. “I would sincerely 
hope that the University would 
handle where a person with a 
disability is supposed to go in 
shelter (during an active shooter 
situation).”

In 
the 
wake 
of 
the 
University’s 
announcement 
of their intention to purchase 
renewable 
energy 
from 
Michigan-based 
company 
DTE 
Energy, 
Overpeck 
referenced the importance 
of making lasting efforts to 
promote carbon neutrality 
beyond campus.
“We’re really all in this 
together,” 
Overpeck 
said. 
“Not just trying to find ways 
to make the University carbon 
neutral as fast as we can, we 
just got out first big wind 
purchase announced today, 
but finding ways to help 
society, other universities, 
our community we live in, the 
state of Michigan, the nation, 
go carbon neutral much faster 
than anybody has really been 
thinking. It’s our job to make 
that happen.”
Before 
taking 
questions 
from the audience, Schlissel 
said he was excited to receive 
feedback 
from 
students 
regarding the effort towards 
carbon neutrality.
“I’ve been hearing from 
students 
and 
faculty, 
so 
I 
really 
welcome 
the 
opportunity to hear from 
you directly to tell you a bit 
about 
what 
I’m 
thinking 
and get your advice as we 
move 
forward,” 
Schlissel 
said. “I can certainly say the 
advocacy 
significantly 
by 
students around the effects 
of greenhouse gases on global 
climate change is coming 
through loud and clear, and I 
want to spend this hour really 
listening to you and hearing 
directly from you.”
Schlissel said community 
input 
is 
key 
to 
his 
understanding of the issue of 
climate change and achieving 
carbon neutrality on campus 
and beyond.
“I do not pretend to be an 
expert on climate change 
and 
global 
warming 
and 
greenhouse 
gases 
— 
I’m 
a biologist and a medical 
doctor and I’m responsible 

for making the best decisions 
I 
can 
on 
behalf 
of 
our 
community,” Schlissel said. 
“When I don’t have expertise, 
I rely on people that really 
do, 
so 
I 
really 
welcome 
everybody’s input.”
Though 
appreciative 
of 
the event, Climate Action 
Movement member Jonathan 
Morris, 
an 
Environment 
and 
Sustainability 
graduate student, said he 
was 
disappointed 
it 
took 
prolonged student activism 
for the dialogue to take place.
“A lot was talked about,” 
Morris said. “I appreciate that 
we were able to have this event 
and it’s pretty unfortunate 
that it took people sitting it at 
Fleming for seven hours and 
10 students getting arrested 
for him to agree to this event, 
because that’s what people 
were asking for.”
When 
asked 
about 
legitimacy of using natural gas 
in attaining carbon neutrality, 
as well as the effectiveness of 
the new Central Power Plant 
expansion, Schlissel said it 
would be valuable to look at 
the University’s immediate 
needs while keeping in mind 
longer term goals.
“I think it is important 
to account honestly for the 
contributions that this new 
combined 
power 
turbine 
make to our efforts around 
carbon neutrality,” Schlissel 
said. “The situation we’re in 
is we remain dependent, for at 
least the short intermediate 
term, to make the steam that 
is necessary on our campus.”
When 
asked 
about 
the 
University’s 
progress 
on 
carbon 
neutrality 
in 
comparison 
to 
other 
big 
schools 
such 
as 
Stanford 
University and Ohio State 
University, 
Schlissel 
said 
every place is different, and 
that comparable universities 
are not necessarily as far 
ahead. 
“Every 
university 
is 
different than every other,” 
Schlissel 
said. 
“Every 
university, as they advertise 
their effort for accounting 
greenhouse 
gases, 
uses 
a 

different set of definitions. 
We count everything: We 
have a very large health 
system, we have thousands of 
residence hall beds, we have 
steam as a source of heating. 
The situation here isn’t the 
same as it is in California. It 
isn’t sunny as much and the 
wind doesn’t blow all the 
time.”
Audience 
members 
immediately 
interjected, 
interrupting 
Schlissel 
and 
calling out questions, in which 
Schlissel attempted to calm 
the crowd before continuing 
to explain his commitment to 
carbon neutrality on campus.
“I’m committed to get us 
to neutrality,” Schlissel said. 
“I’m asking this group to help 
us figure out how to do it and 
do it as quickly as possible. 
The example is brought up 
pretty often of Ohio State 
University, who is just down 
the road sort of, who is given 
a lot of credibility in this 
community — surprisingly. 
I don’t think they’re ahead 
of us in their efforts around 
carbon neutrality. I think you 
have to look at the data.”
Tegwyn 
John, 
LSA 
senior and CAM member, 
categorized the atmosphere 
during 
the 
question 
and 
answer 
session 
as 
disorganized and combative.
“I 
think 
people 
were 
clapping to the questioners, 
and 
nobody 
applauded 
Schlissel’s 
answers,” 
John 
said. “I don’t think anybody 
in the room today felt like 
they 
were 
actually 
being 
listened to or getting genuine 
answers to their questions.”
Alice 
Elliott, 
an 
Environment 
and 
Sustainability alum, said she 
felt the event led to some 
conflicting statements from 
Schlissel regarding practices 
and 
expectations 
for 
achieving carbon neutrality.
“He 
talks 
about 
the 
University being the leader 
and the University setting the 
stage for carbon neutrality 
and for climate action, but 
then immediately says, ‘Oh, it 
has to be everybody,’” Elliott 

said. “It’s confusing to me 
why he seems to want to have 
the University be both the 
leader and the best in climate 
action, but then says that you 
need to do more, and recycle, 
and be lobbying and register 
to vote. If we’re here, if we sat 
in the (Fleming) office and 
we got arrested, we’ve done 
all those things already.”
Schlissel 
was 
asked 
repeatedly 
whether 
the 
University would divest from 
companies 
that 
produce 
fossil fuels. Schlissel said 
divestment lowers the value of 
the University’s endowment, 
which is necessary to fund 
beneficial 
activities 
and 
supplies on campus.
“Essentially, 
we 
don’t 
divest,” Schlissel said. “It’s 
not this cause, it’s essentially 
all causes … We get more 
payout from our endowment 
here than we get money from 
the state of Michigan, so 
it’s really critical for us as a 
robust university… If we begin 
the process of narrowing 
what the endowment can 
invest in, based on very valid 
arguments and concerns from 
sincere people, the ability to 
invest shrinks, the value of 
the endowment goes down 
and the institution suffers. 
We’re 
just 
not 
going 
to 
divest.”
Morris said the refusal 
to 
divest 
represents 
a 
severe conflict between the 
University’s 
carbon 
goals 
and their desire to retain 
the value of the endowment, 
criticizing 
Schlissel 
for 
refusing to divest.
“This is the most egregious 
thing 
the 
University 
is 
doing,” Morris said. “He says 
this is an existential threat, 
that 
young 
people’s 
lives 
are at stake, that he believes 
the 
science, 
he 
believes 
the gravity and the unique 
existential challenge of this 
issue, and yet this university 
has a billion dollars directly 
invested in the fossil fuel 
industry.”

He 
said 
the 
University’s 
competitive nature makes low 
income students feel as though 
they must fit in with the lifestyle of 
students of higher socioeconomic 
status.
“I’ve been in a position to 
speak with people about different 
social expectations,” Sova said. “I 
definitely think Michigan by far is 
the most competitive and polarizing 
in the sense that if you’re low income 
here, I think you definitely have to 
try to blend in with people.”
In 2017, The New York Times 
found Michigan’s class of 2013 had 
the highest median parent income of 
27 “highly selective” public colleges, 
at $154,000 per year.
In 2018, under alumni Anushka 
Sarkar 
and 
Nadine 
Jawad’s 
administration, 
CSG 
published 
an affordability guide to provide 
advice on how to save money 
while attending the University. 
After its publication, the guide was 
lambasted for being out of touch 
to struggles lower socioeconomic 
status students face. Suggestions for 
saving money included restricting 
impulse purchases and cutting back 
on laundry services.
In 
response, 
Public 
Policy 
senior Lauren Schandevel, another 
student who self identifies as low 
socioeconomic status, created her 
own affordability guide called 
“Being Not-Rich at UM” to provide 
what she hoped would be a more 
accurate 
and 
comprehensive 
publication for low socioeconomic 
status students. The document is 
public and can be edited by anyone.
Schandevel discussed how the 
CSG guide was offensive in its 
disregard for realistic economic 
limitations lower socioeconomic 
status students face.
“I think a lot of low-income 
students, myself in particular, were 
offended and a little frustrated about 
the assumption that we don’t have 
money because we are frivolously 
spending, when that’s not the case,” 
Schandevel said. “I think people 
were a little disappointed when the 
guide came out because we kind of 
expected more.”
Sova had heard about Schandevel’s 
guide before he transferred. While 
he initially paid little attention to 
the information in the document, 
he said he quickly realized it was a 
crucial resource for many students 
with low socioeconomic status on 
campus. 
“I was actually sent that guide 
probably by 10 different people 
before I got here,” Sova said. “And I 
remember thinking, as a Michigan 
State student at the time, I was like, 
‘That’s ridiculous, I won’t need that, 
I’m sure it’s not that different over 
there.’ It sincerely is.”
Schandevel said a peripheral goal 
of the guide was to foster a sense 
of community among contributors 
and readers by publicizing a sort of 
database that could benefit many 
students who often feel invisible on 
campus.
“Being 
on 
a 
predominantly 
wealthy 
campus, 
low 
income 
students fly under the radar,” 
Schandevel 
said. 
“When 
that 
happens, they sort of internalize 
some of the alienation that they feel 
on this campus … Giving them space 
where they can find each other and 
share experiences is so powerful.”
City Councilmember Elizabeth 
Nelson, D-Ward 4, said in an 

interview with The Daily that 
the University should take more 
responsibility in helping students 
with affordability as enrollment 
increases, particularly with housing, 
but noted City Council’s limited say 
in the matter.
“I’m gradually learning about 
how little influence we seem to have 
over the University,” Nelson said. “As 
a city, we would like the University 
to take more responsibility for, 
‘We’re going to admit this many 
more students and we’ve made no 
plans for where they will live.’”
According to a report sent to The 
Daily by Jennifer Hall, Executive 
Director of the Ann Arbor Housing 
Commision, 
an 
average 
four-
bedroom unit in Ann Arbor is 
$1,140 per bed per month in rent, a 
4.64 percent increase from the year 
before. 
In February of 2018, CSG reached 
out to Schandevel for guidance 
on how to provide more effective 
resources to lower socioeconomic 
status 
students. 
In 
association 
with CSG, Schandevel created the 
Michigan Affordability Task Force, 
which plans to start writing a five-
year plan next semester to serve as 
a reference for future CSG parties 
when creating legislation centered 
on the well-being of students on 
campus with lower socioeconomic 
status.
Schandevel reflected on CSG’s 
attempt throughout this term to 
address concerns of students with 
lower socioeconomic status through 
initiatives like a housing survey and 
the introduction of the task force. 
She proposed a housing survey for 
students to report their housing 
experiences, rating landlords and 
housing 
companies. 
According 
to 
Schandevel, 
the 
housing 
survey — implemented by former 
CSG President Daniel Greene’s 
administration — will be annual.
CSG President Ben Gerstein, an 
LSA sophomore, and Vice President 
Isabelle Blanchard, an LSA junior, 
said they believe additional surveys 
to gauge student opinion and 
experiences are critical to their 
mission for the upcoming year.
“I think doing surveys like that 

helps us to compile the information 
to really draw proper conclusions 
from it and also to have the data to 
share with administrators or City 
Council about what the real facts 
are that students are experiencing,” 
Blanchard said.
Blanchard 
said 
their 
administration 
will 
work 
to 
advertise campus resources to 
maximize affordability.
“For academic affordability, it’s 
touched upon usually every year, 
lowering the cost of textbooks, 
but also increasing the amount of 
textbooks we have in the library.” 
Blanchard said. “It’s CSG’s job to 
publicize the resources that are 
already available.”
After reading Schandevel’s guide, 
Ann Hower, director of the Office 
of New Student Programs, created 
a PDF version of the document 
to be used as a central guide on 
affordability for incoming students. 
Hower said she was moved by the 
collaborative nature of document.
“It was the students offering 
encouragement 
and 
support,” 
Hower said. “I think there can be 
a feeling that a student may feel 
like they are all alone … The most 
important part of this is keeping the 
student comments.”

“The Latinx community is 
very diverse and the stories that 
are told are often not reflective 
of our community,” Morales 
said. “And that’s reflective of 
American society in general.”
But 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
according to Trelles, there are 
shared 
identities, 
histories 
and sometimes problems that 
affect these communities on 
a national level. And it is this 
reason, Trelles said, that it is 
important to recognize the 
nuances behind it.
“Beyond country of origin 
or geographic placement, the 
different factors that form this 
broad community has to do 
with language, ethnicity, race, 
et cetera,” Trelles said.
Alvarez is the founder and 
executive editor of Outlier 
Media and through her focus 
on a localized perspective, she 
believes journalism should be 
responsive to the needs of the 

people, rather than the needs of 
a big institutional newspaper. 
According 
to 
Alvarez, 
the 
difficulty of finding the proper 
language to describe such a 
range of communities is the 
reason that coverage is so poor.
“Even for those who do have 
an identity that is rooted in 
Latinx, we’re not necessarily 
going 
to 
do 
a 
good 
job 
representing this community 
because it is so big,” Alvarez 
said. “We can see it’s being 
poorly 
done 
in 
American 
journalism. People are too far 
away from it, the coverage is 
too far away.” 
According to Nelsen, who 
was a former Time Magazine 
correspondent and New York 
Times contributor in Chile, the 
way Latin America is covered by 
the international community is 
very distinct. And due to a lack 
of diversity and imagination in 
newsrooms, there is a limited 
view of stories. 
“You can see it with the 
caravan stories — they all 
focus on tragedy and misery,” 

Nelsen said. “The way the 
United States views Latino 
communities is that they try to 
put everybody into a couple of 
boxes.”
Trelles 
explained 
how 
the 
way 
journalists 
contextualize their stories has 
a bigger impact on the world 
as demographic shifts provide 
more 
opportunities. 
When 
Trelles was covering Hurricane 
Maria 
in 
Puerto 
Rico, 
he 
witnessed the particular ways 
the story was framed on TV and 
newspaper articles.
“Trump isn’t the story, ” 
Trelles said. “It has to do with 
Trump, but it also has to do 
with the negligence of local 
authorities, and that was lost 
because people focused on the 
bigger Trump story.” 
According to Nelsen, elitism 
in bigger media outlets often 
makes it difficult for stories to 
be told with a focus on local 
politics or the narratives of 
community members. 
“The opportunity to story-
tell continues to grow as we 

convince our editors and the 
world as to why a story is 
important,” Nelsen said.
Storytelling was a common 
theme throughout the panel. 
Many panelists said it is one 
of their values as writers and 
journalists, as well as one of 
their inspirations.
“The 
deepest 
connection 
that can be made through 
journalism 
is 
storytelling,” 
Trelles said. “It’s the best 
way of learning how to walk 
a mile in someone else’s shoes 
without having to travel to 
that indigenous community of 
Mexico.”
Trelles 
concluded 
by 
emphasizing journalists’ duty 
to dive into stories and bring 
to light the diversity within the 
Latinx community. 
“Latin America is united 
by language and the shared 
history, but divided by the kinds 
of beans they eat,” Trelles said. 
“The moral is that there’s a lot 
more than the surface, and it is 
our responsibility to recognize 
that.”

Castranova 
highlighted 
Shake 
Shack’s use of high quality natural 
ingredients, as well as the chain’s 
environmentally sustainable building 
practices.
“In keeping with Shake Shack’s 
commitment to green architecture 
and eco-friendly construction, the Ann 
Arbor Shack will be constructed with 
recycled and sustainable materials,” 
Castranova wrote. “Booths will be 
made from lumber certified by the 
Forest Stewardship Council, and table 
tops will be made from reclaimed 
bowling alley lanes.”
The company emphasized their 
impact on the local Ann Arbor 
community, through partnering with 
local charities and food purveyors.
“We’ll also have a local charity 
partner to whom we’ll donate 5% of 
sales from one of our (frozen custard) 
concretes. Our Shack team will 
also volunteer,” Castranova wrote. 
“Shake Shack’s mission is to Stand for 
Something Good, from its premium 
ingredients and caring hiring practices 
to its inspiring designs and deep 
community investment.” 
However, despite Shake Shack’s 
commitment to be environmentally 
friendly, Business sophomore Jackie 

Spryshak, a Graham Sustainability 
Scholar, said she was opposed to Shake 
Shack’s decision to expand into Ann 
Arbor.
“Businesses 
entering 
any 
community, especially large corporate 
businesses, need to seriously focus on 
the environmental and social impact 
they bring,” Spryshak said. “Shake 
Shack seems like they just want to 
make a statement about ‘sustainability’ 
to meet the bare minimum effort and 
they certainly aren’t going to serve the 
community in any way.”
She cited concerns about plastic 
and food waste production and 
contributions to unsustainable food 
systems and industrial agriculture, 
as well as energy consumption and 
overhead for the restaurant. Spryshak 
also said the city of Ann Arbor 
should play a part in the business’s 
sustainability practices.
“I think it’s partly the city’s 
responsibility to ensure that they at least 
have their building be LEED-certified 
and ideally have a commitment to low-
impact utensils and plates,” Spryshak 
said. “They also need to comment on 
their energy source and where/how 
they will manage their food waste and 
grease.”

Wang echoed the executive 
statement, saying it would be better 
for RHA to provide events and 
services to the students they serve 
rather than to pay its members. He 
said elected representatives should 
serve because they feel a calling to 
the role with no expectation of pay.
“We do it because we love it 
and we have the opportunity to 
do it,” Wang said. “We recognize 
that we have an opportunity to 
make change on campus and that 
our time that we put into this is 
purely volunteer work and it’s not 
something that we feel needs to be 
compensated for.”
Wang cited a 2017 Central 
Student 
Government 
resolution 
to pay members that was vetoed 
by then-CSG president Anushka 
Sarkar. The veto came on the heels 
of the creation of the Leadership 
Engagement Scholarship, a CSG 
and Office of Student Life award 
that offers a small group of 
students financial support for the 
cost of membership dues as well 
as providing compensation for 
the unpaid time devoted to their 
student organizations.
In a statement released following 

her veto, Sarkar expressed concerns 
of potential power dynamics created 
by 
intergovernmental 
payment 
systems as well as the public release 
of student financial records.
RHA 
brands 
itself 
as 
the 
University’s 
residence 
hall 
governance. On its website, RHA 
advertises 
its 
Pre-Class 
Bash, 
the Plants in the Hall! initiative 
and Siblings Weekend as recent 
accomplishments.
The 
association 
has 
been 
criticized in the past for an 
“extremely 
difficult” 
work 
environment leading one former 
executive board member to resign 
in 2018, and for its use of funds to 
send North Quad Multicultural 
Council members on a service trip 
to Peru in 2011. 
In an email to The Daily, RHA 
President Brianna Marble, LSA 
junior, declined an interview on 
behalf of the executive board, but 
wrote the board is looking forward 
to further discussion about their 
decision.
“As of right now, the Executive 
Board will not be taking any 
interviews,” Marble wrote. “We are 
excited to continue the conversation 
on this topic with Housing and the 
future Executive Board.”
In the resolution, the RHA 

stated its executive board works 
10 to 12 hours each week while 
working 
without 
receiving 
compensation, whereas RAs work 
20 hours per week and receive full 
room and board plus additional 
compensation, 
totaling 
$11,020 
on average. The RHA wrote the 
compensation available through 
being an RA could potentially 
encourage low-income residents to 
first seek out an RA position before 
an RHA position.
Ultimately, the RHA wrote the 
resolution would encourage low-
income students to apply to and 
join the executive board as well as 
students currently on the board to 
serve more terms. The association 
wrote this will allow for a greater 
ability to enact change within 
the halls because of the learning 
curve associated with serving on 
the board, sometimes hindering 
progress for members in their first 
term.
Business 
freshman 
Fallon 
Renehan, 
a 
current 
Bursley 
Residence 
Hall 
resident, 
acknowledged 
the 
RHA’s 
and 
resident advisers’ hard work, but 
said she feels using the money for 
dorm activities should take priority 
over 
compensating 
the 
RHA 
executive board.

“Personally, I feel like dorm 
activities are really important 
for kids who don’t have other 
opportunities and I feel like 
although the RHA board does a 
good job, they are there for the 
kids,” Renehan said. “Paying them 
and taking away from the ability to 
do their job well — which would be 
to put on dorm activities like that for 
kids — would be more important.”
One 
RA, 
who 
requested 
anonymity out of fear of retribution, 
said compensation for the position 
would encourage more students to 
seek out these roles, which would 
ultimately make the organization 
better. He also noted RHA’s failure 
in the past to do meaningful work 
and said keeping the money for 
student activities would not make 
those events any more effective.
“Having a paid position in RHA 
and LSA Student Government — 
which they don’t have, but some 
parties have pushed for in the past 
— will naturally make the positions 
more competitive,” the RA said. 
“They’ll put added pressure on 
them to do more. The RHA hasn’t 
been especially effective. They 
haven’t really added to campus 
very much, and I think being on the 
executive board is work and work 
should be compensated.”

L

ate 
philosopher 
and 
novelist 
George 
Santayana 
famously 
said, 
“Those 
who 
cannot 
remember 
the 
past 
are 
condemned to repeat it.” In 
recent weeks, this sentiment 
has showed itself to be true in 
regards to the ever-escalating 
governmental 
crisis 
in 
Venezuela. As he is prone to 
do, Russian President Vladimir 
Putin has decided to extend the 
tentacles of his foreign policy 
into places it doesn’t belong. 
This 
time 
he 
has 
chosen 
South America, and has acted 
by providing military aid to 
the embattled president of 
Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro.
Maduro, under immense 
protest 
and 
pressure 
from 
the 
Venezuelan 
people 
to 
abdicate 
his 
premiership 
after 
potentially 
fraudulent 
elections 
last 
May, 
has 
sought to remain in power 
at all costs. One particularly 
extreme measure to preserve 
his power was his blocking of 
international 
humanitarian 
aid to relieve people who have 
been crushed by a crumbling 
economy, viewing such aid 
as an imperialistic American 
Trojan horse. In the fight to 
decide Venezuela’s future, the 
United States and most Latin 
American and European Union 
countries 
have 
decided 
to 
support Juan Guaidó, president 
of 
the 
National 
Assembly, 
as interim head of state. If 
he becomes the provisional 
president 
of 
Venezuela, 
Guaidó says he will call for 
new elections to determine 
democratically who will rule 
his country, after leading the 
charge against Maduro and his 
corrupt election last year.
Along with their packages 
of material aid, the U.S. and its 
allies in the Venezuela crisis 
have tried to bring international 
legitimacy to Guaidó’s efforts 
to restore democracy. Their 
biggest challenge in doing so, 
however, has been gaining 
the support of the Venezuelan 
military. 
In 
an 
interview 
published in The Washington 
Post on Feb. 7, Antonio Rivero, 
a former Venezuelan general 
who was exiled in 2014, noted 
that challenges in this regard 
mainly come from the military 
allegiances to late President 
Hugo Chávez and his ideas. 
Some Venezuelans see Maduro 
as the “son” of Chavez and 
his legacy. Rivero also noted 
that military personnel are 
concerned that their illegal 
activities, 
such 
as 
black 
market drug trafficking, will 
be punished under Guaidó 
or another future president’s 
rule. As such, it has proven 
difficult for those who support 
an interim Guaidó presidency 
to 
convince 
the 
military 
leadership in Venezuela to join 
the cause and abandon Maduro.
Moscow 
has 
made 
this 
task even more difficult in 

the last month, after planes 
carrying 100 Russian troops 
landed in Venezuela. Putin 
hopes to bolster the staying 
power of Maduro and fortify 
his military support with his 
own forces. For quite some 
time, Russia has provided aid 
and other resources to the 
Maduro regime, which, unlike 
aid coordinated by Guaido, 
was accepted by the military 
government. 
On 
Thursday, 
U.S. President Donald Trump 
scolded Putin, telling him to 
“get out” of Venezuela, and 
his national security adviser 
John Bolton warned against 
external interference in the 
Western hemisphere by states 
seeking to prop up Maduro. The 
Russian president responded 
by 
promising 
to 
continue 
arming Caracas and to keep 
troops there.
This pattern of involvement 
from Russia is eerily similar 
to its actions in Syria shortly 
after 
the 
breakout 
of 
the 
Syrian Civil War. In the cases 
of both Venezuela and Syria, 
two authoritarian leaders have 
acted against their own people 
in order to maintain power. 
The U.S. placed a plethora of 
sanctions against the offending 
regimes. Then, Russia came 
in to support the regimes and 
keep the tyrannical leader in 
power against the will of the 
people. Both Damascus and 
Caracas have had historic ties 
with Russia, and Putin likely 
hopes to assure that these 
governments 
remain 
firmly 
allied with Moscow in the 
foreseeable future. The thought 
of Venezuela — a member of 
OPEC and a longtime Russian 
ally — growing closer to the 
West is likely a deep concern of 
Putin’s.
Further, Russia is not the 
only state with which the U.S. 
and Europe have had frosty 
relations 
that 
is 
growing 
more involved in the situation 
in Venezuela. China, also a 
supporter of both the Assad and 
Maduro regimes, has come out 
in support of Russian efforts to 
maintain Maduro’s rule. This 
February, China vetoed a UN 
Security 
Council 
resolution 
that 
would 
have 
spoken 
out 
against 
the 
fraudulent 
elections in which Maduro 
claims to have been re-elected 
and called for another round 
of elections. On March 26, 
Chinese 
Foreign 
Ministry 
spokesman Geng Shuang took 
a shot at U.S. efforts to halt 
Russia’s interference by stating 
that “Latin America (is not) a 
certain country’s backyard.” 
Beijing’s 
intent 
to 
again 
support Russia, as well as their 
own agenda in Venezuela, is 
not a surprise.
China has also worked to 
maintain strong relations with 
Caracas since the turn of the 
century, 
eyeing 
Venezuela’s 
chief 
resource: 
oil. 
When 
Venezuela was ruled by Chavez, 

the two countries cooperated 
on oil trade on a large scale. 
Though 
it 
has 
stressed 
a 
policy of non-interference in 
international affairs, China has 
subtly been active within Latin 
America, quietly advancing its 
own goals. A prime example 
was 
in 
2011, 
when 
China 
financed 
and 
built 
Costa 
Rica’s Estadio Nacional soccer 
stadium as a supposed gift to 
the country. The gift came 
with a price, however: Costa 
Rica soon cut its trade with 
Taiwan, a longtime adversary 
to Beijing. It also opened a 
large free trade agreement 
with China. Though China’s 
government claims it avoids 
interfering with the affairs of 
sovereign governments, even 
in Latin America, it is on record 
for having used bribes to get 
what it wants from other states. 
So much for respecting another 
nation’s independent will.
Trump 
and 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Michael 
Pompeo 
should remember the past and 
realize that they must escalate 
their efforts to see Guaidó 
peacefully take the role of 
interim president in Venezuela. 
Though Trump’s resistance to 
sending troops to Venezuela 
or elsewhere abroad may be 
justified, his administration’s 
lack of concrete action in 
response 
to 
Russia’s 
and 
China’s efforts will lead to a 
bad outcome for the United 
States and the Venezuelan 
people.
Former President Barack 
Obama waited too long when 
Putin entrenched his forces in 
the Syria conflict and China 
aided Assad on the world 
stage. Though the Venezuelan 
crisis 
presents 
different 
challenges, the same must not 
be allowed to happen. If prior 
mistakes are repeated, then 
with or without U.S. sanctions 
against the Maduro regime, 
the people of Venezuela will 
continue to starve and suffer, 
and their economy will be 
run further into the ground. 
Hyperinflation has risen to a 
historic rate, and citizens are 
already forced to make drastic 
choices such as whether to eat 
stray dogs and cats or let their 
families go hungry.
In the face of this mounting 
regional threat, Washington 
should 
also 
remember 
the 
foundational 
U.S. 
foreign 
policy 
established 
by 
the 
Monroe 
Doctrine. 
Hostile 
states 
consolidating 
their 
military 
power 
with 
a 
regional adversary has proven 
frighteningly 
dangerous 
to 
America in the not-too-distant 
past. Though the Cold War 
may be over, Trump should 
remember that a threat to 
freedom 
and 
democracy 
abroad — especially within our 
hemisphere — is a threat to us.

The technology that is slowly taking over our lives
I

nternet of things. It’s a 
term that most everyone 
has 
heard 
about, 
but 
also 
one 
that 
nobody 
actually 
understands. 
The 
reality 
is, 
the 
internet of things, 
IoT for short, is 
a 
revolutionary 
technology 
that 
has real potential 
to 
shake 
up 
the 
future of integrated 
technology. It is a 
gateway to artificial 
intelligence and the direct 
pathway to business success.
But what exactly is it? IoT is 
pretty much everything it says 
it is. It is the huge network of 
objects and everyday devices 
that are connected to the 
internet. While we are used 
to the traditional smartphone, 
laptop and tablet as the only 
entryway to the internet, IoT 
has managed to really shake 
things 
up 
by 
introducing 
potential for connectivity for 
other objects like refrigerators, 
pillows and even umbrellas. 
Such 
technology 
creates 
the 
avenue 
for 
artificial 
intelligence 
and 
inherently 
“smart” devices that can better 
cater to personalization and 
specific function.
The fact of the matter is 
that the number of connected 
devices is expected to nearly 
triple by 2025 to an expected 
number of 75 billion devices. 
Not only this, but the worth of 
the IoT industry is expected 
to grow to a whopping $6.2 
trillion, 
greatly 
increasing 
the projected maximums for 
health care and manufacturing. 
Evidently, 
the 
growth 
is 
indicative of changing times.
How might it affect us? 
For one, IoT is seemingly 
turning around the traditional 
cloud-based computing model 
that has reigned supreme for 
the past decade or so. Cloud 
computing is a fairly new trend 
in a back-and-forth history 
of computing. While the first 
computer was centralized, the 
introduction of servers created 
a more distributed model. 

Inevitably, 
the 
move 
back 
toward a decentralized system 
is forthcoming, and it seems 
highly likely that 
the IoT might just 
be the movement 
that 
will 
pull 
it 
off. As connected 
devices 
become 
more 
and 
more 
complex, it becomes 
tougher 
to 
solely 
rely on the cloud, 
especially 
when 
intricate 
decisions 
and 
output 
are 
needed in very short periods 
of time. Expect to see a trend 
toward this in the near future.
Perhaps on a more negative 
note, however, is the problem 
of 
security. 
The 
moment 
we 
increase 
the 
numbers 
of devices connected to the 
network, the more exposed and 
readily accessible our personal 
information and preferences 
become. As such, the IoT 
movement does pose quite a 
significant risk in this sense. 
This is perhaps validated by 
the Mirai botnet attack in 
2016 that led many to fear an 
apocalypse of the internet. 
While perpetrated by a few 
teenagers with intentions far 
less grand than the ensuing 
attack, 
the 
malware 
was 
successfully 
able 
to 
hack 
into various IoT devices and 
leverage them to create a 
malicious network of internet-
connected 
devices 
called 
botnets to complete a task 
that managed to render much 
of the internet unavailable on 
the East Coast for a day. And 
even though IoT security has 
arguably advanced quite a bit 
since then, there still is a lot of 
ground to be made, especially 
when reports show only “48 
percent 
of 
businesses 
can 
even detect whether they’ve 
suffered an IoT breach” and 
“only 59 percent of companies 
encrypt all their IoT-related 
data.”
Nevertheless, 
IoT 
maintains its transformative 
benefits, much of which lie 
in the arena of sustainability. 
As such devices begin to 

be implemented more and 
more, it is easier for wasteful 
appliances and products to 
become more cost and energy 
efficient. Take, for example, 
Cree SmartCast Technology, 
a new application of smart 
lighting. 
The 
application 
of 
IoT 
technology 
allows 
for 
increased 
savings 
in 
energy 
and 
other 
costs 
while creating an integrated 
lighting system that offers 
more 
personalization 
than 
other technologically-lacking 
alternatives.
A 
massive 
future 
uptrend in big data comes 
as a result of this. Many of 
these technologies rely on 
maintaining vast directories 
of data and monitoring them 
in order to create increased 
personalization. For example, 
as cities begin to adopt IoT 
solutions 
to 
make 
their 
operations efficient, a natural 
byproduct is the collection 
of massive amounts of user 
data and preferences. But in 
order to create intelligent and 
innovative systems, this data 
must be sorted through. Big 
data offers this solution by 
combining 
volume, 
variety, 
velocity, veracity and value 
to create flexible and smart 
programs. It isn’t a coincidence 
that “data scientist” is being 
called the sexiest job of the 
21st 
century. 
And 
while 
naysayers claim that big data 
doesn’t have a future in the 
face of “fast data,” the future 
of artificial intelligence and 
machine 
learning 
simply 
becomes an impossible task 
if efficient big data solutions 
don’t exist.
To get to the point, IoT is 
where the future is. So, if you 
haven’t chosen your major 
yet, consider data science as 
a possibility. And if you have 
decided 
your 
major, 
learn 
some data science anyway. 
Because before you know it, 
IoT will have taken over your 
life.

A

nyone who has ever 
played 
or 
watched 
sports has experienced 
this feeling: When everyone’s 
heart drops, the game stops 
and we all stand still. No, I am 
not talking about hitting the 
game winning shot that leaves 
you breathless. I am talking 
about the only true moment of 
communal tragedy in sports: a 
serious injury.
Jusuf Nurkić, an NBA player 
for the Portland Trail Blazers, 
experienced an injury March 
26 that made many Reddit 
users “feel like crying.” The 
injury happened on a routine 
basketball play when Nurkić 
went up for a rebound and, on 
his way down, landed on an 
opposing players foot, causing 
his leg to bend and snap in 
half just above his ankle. 
Nurkić is out indefinitely with 
compound fractures to his left 
tibia and fibula.
As I put my hand in front 
of my eyes and tried to look 
away from the video clip of 
Nurkić’s 
gruesome 
injury, 
another feeling began to swell 
over me: a feeling of shame 
and guilt. In reality, when 
I clicked on a NSFW injury 
video, I knew that it would 
be gruesome. In fact, I even 
let the video play over a few 
times to make sure that I had 
really seen what happened 
to him. I made sure to really 
soak in how horrifying the 
whole thing was. Why did I 
choose to watch something 
I knew would send shivers 
down my spine? Why was 
I trying to look away from 
something I chose to watch? 
More importantly, why were 
other people doing this exact 
same thing?
I think the best way to get 
at these questions is to start 
with a much larger question 
about the logic of sports 
fandom: Why do people watch 
sports? As I see it, sports 
fans are compelled by one 

driving desire: the desire for 
the spectacle. We lust for a 
window into the unimaginable 
and 
the 
unbelievable. 
In 
the most spectacular sports 
moments, our sense of self can 
drift away and we can become 
entranced by the miraculous 
movements 
of 
the 
human 
body. It is this fading away 
from the personal that allows 
for fan bases to turn into 
pseudo-religious institutions 
and for people to yell at their 
TV screens and jump for joy. 
Our bodies and minds become 
so mesmerized by sporting 
spectacles that we cease to 
have the ability to control 
ourselves.

But what makes a sporting 
spectacle different from other 
spectacles like movies and art 
exhibitions? As I see it, one 
common thread that ties all 
sports together is an emphasis 
on the athletic capabilities 
of bodies. The Olympics are 
a perfect example of this 
idea. The Olympics are a 
place where the strengths 
and weakness of every body 
type are put on full display — 
where the limits of the human 
body are tested in the labs we 
call stadiums. It seems fitting, 
then, that sports, a fusion of 
the spectacle and the body, 
are a place where the beautiful 
accomplishments of the body 
and 
the 
body’s 
grotesque 
failures are displayed and 
enjoyed by sports fans.
What I have been calling 

the 
“grotesque” 
refers 
to 
injuries in which the body gets 
crushed and cracked in ways 
we never thought imaginable, 
but it is worth considering 
how the “grotesque” might 
also be thought of as a form 
of violence. In both instances 
of violence and grotesque 
injuries, we find wounded 
bodies screaming out for help. 
Put simply, we see people in 
pain.
In modern sports fandom, 
we often like to pretend that 
our lust for violence does not 
pull us closer in. For example, 
most football fans, like myself, 
pretend that we watch the 
game for clever strategies 
and 
teamwork. 
Yet, 
it 
is 
quite obvious that football is 
structured around the idea of 
bodies violently crashing into 
each other. A quick genealogy 
of sports further shows how 
we 
have 
sublimated 
our 
values when we claim to hate 
violence but love sports like 
football. Some of the first 
Western sports were built 
around honoring violent acts 
like limb dislocation and eye-
gouging.
Every time we flip on a 
game, like the one where 
Nurkić cracked his leg in half, 
we tell ourselves that we hope 
to see graceful athletic plays, 
cutting edge strategy, and 
our team win; however, deep 
down, we also want to see 
violence, mental lapses and the 
other team lose. The virality 
of injuries like Nurkić’s shows 
that our drive to watch sports 
is powered by success and 
failure, by bodily spectacles 
of both grace and violence. In 
short, the reason that I chose 
to click on the Nurkić injury 
video is the same reason I 
choose to click on a LeBron 
James highlight: I want to see 
a bodily spectacle.

As part of the human condition, 
there are universal moments that 
will always leave us wistful and 
dewy-eyed, longing for a picturesque 
moment that no longer exists and can 
never exist again. These ubiquitous 
moments that invade human 
emotion include late night 
drives with the windows 
down in the backseat of your 
best friend’s car, or your lover 
bringing you coffee in bed or, 
most notably, the grandeur of 
the feeling of the beach. 
Circa 
Waves, 
an 
indie 
rock band from Liverpool 
(kind of like The Strokes if 
they were pop), captures the 
art of reminiscing through 
their essence of romantic, 
summertime guitar pop rock. 
Their junior album, What’s 
It Like Over There?, exhibits their 
knack for playing into sentimentality, 
digging into spaces that pluck on the 
human heartstrings and operate on 
nostalgia.
In 2015, Circa Waves released 
their debut album, Young Chasers, 
which launched the wild success of 
their hit single “T-shirt Weather.” 
The comparisons between “T-shirt 
Weather” and the single that drives 
their 
junior 
album, 
“Movies,” 
are endless. Both singles feature 
Circa Waves’s niche of extremely 
catchy, melodic and guitar-driven 
reminiscing. “T-shirt Weather” came 
from an album which interrogated 
life 
among 
the 
clouds, 
with 
summertime lyrics: “I remember 
T-shirt weather, I remember some 

days, we were singing out lungs in 
the backseat together.” “Movies, 
”which carries What’s It Like 
Over There?, operates in the same 
manner, banking on the emotional 
state created when driving around: 
“Remember when we drove your car 
down the road? It was just like in the 
movies.”

While What’s It Like Over There? 
regresses in some areas to the 
symbolism and romantic emotions 
of their debut album and at the 
same time relying heavily on the 
pre-released singles which carry the 
album, What’s It Like Over There? 
exhibits development in exploring 
spaces that are authentic versus 
spaces that are insincere. Circa Waves 
impresses with their extension into 
darker moments, weaving between 
guitar driven, upbeat energy into 
dark and soft moments which 
cross-examine the link between our 
environment and our integrity.
The opening song, “What’s It like 
Over There,” starts with the stark 
removal of the listener from a genuine 
environment. The beginning of the 

song creates an auditory heaven, 
the sounds of crashing waves and 
the soft chirping of seagulls in the 
distance. Swiftly, this paradise is cut, 
with the sound of heavy footsteps 
and a garage door closing, removing 
the listeners from the nirvana of the 
beach. The cover art for the album, 
shot at Greatstone Beach, includes 
a man and woman in the 
ocean, one covering the 
eyes of the other. This art, 
paired with the opening 
track, immediately links 
self-reflection with one’s 
physical 
surroundings. 
Circa Waves plays into 
the common trope of 
indie-rock: 
questioning 
authenticity.
Circa Waves then makes 
multiple 
references 
to 
morality. The song “Me, 
Myself, and Hollywood” 
darkens the mood with a 
savage bass line and a metronome-
esque 
drum 
sequence, 
with 
questioning lyrics: “Have I been sad 
like I thought I would? And have 
I been bad? Or have I been good? 
In Hollywood.” Good versus evil 
intent is contemplated throughout, 
interlacing between spaces that 
question 
a 
humans’ 
rectitude 
(Hollywood) and pure, honest spaces 
that are “just like in the movies” 
(from track “Movies”).
The dark twists into self-doubt 
paired with the airy, buoyancy of 
guitar pop-rock that one comes to 
expect from Circa Waves makes this 
album a strong candidate for summer 
time drives, with the windows down, 
in the backseat of your best friend’s 
car.

What’s It Like 
Over There?

Circa Waves

Transgressive Records

On a cold night in Oak Hill, West Virginia, I sat with my father by 
the glow of a Christmas tree, waiting for the New Year’s Eve ball to 
drop in Times Square, NYC. A quiet house, a quiet night, the howl of 
a coal train echoing through the mountains — a timeless longing that 
descends when the moon rises over the hills of West Virginia. And 
as we sat there, a familiar twang suddenly filtered through the radio 
— it was Willie Nelson. But not Willie Nelson as my father and I had 
heard him before. I pride myself on knowing the works of Patsy Cline, 
Waylon Jennings, Buck Owens, Hank Williams and, of course, Willie 
Nelson, by heart. But on that quiet New Year’s Eve, to our surprise, we 
were confronted with a song that was new and unfamiliar.
“Look around you / Look down the bar 
from you / At the faces that you see / Are 
you sure this is where you’re meant to be?” 
That question hung heavy in the air. Our 
trip out west had been last minute and 
ramshackle. It had been a fight to corral my 
family together to celebrate the holiday, 
full of coercion, a few tears, and blatant 
bribes. The mournful, slow guitar of 
Willie Nelson’s “Are You Sure” penetrated 
somewhere deep in my soul. For a moment, 
I wondered — was I sure this is where I was 
meant to be?
Yes, it was.
And then the ball dropped on New 
Year’s Eve.
Later, I tracked down the album from 
“Are You Sure,” to find the Holy Grail 

of Willie Nelson’s The Demos Project, Vol. One. The original album, 
Things to Remember: The Pamper Demos is a collection of some of 
Willie Nelson’s earliest recordings. For digital streaming, The Pamper 
Demos was released as The Demos Project (Vol. one & two) in 2016.
It is a wonder, for fans new and old, to find this goldmine of 
Nelson material. The album has the same familiar lonesome cry of 
Nelson’s best known works, but is more bare-bones and minimalist 
in the instrumentation. Everything about the album is softer, more 
vulnerable; Willie Nelson’s song-writing and woeful lyrics are on 
full display. While “Are You Sure” is a personal favorite — the song 
is a haunting echo that strikes the soul — every track on the album is 
fantastic.
“Hello Walls” opens with the whine of the guitar imitating an 
answering “Hello, hello,” making for a somber, yet fun experience. 

“A Moment Isn’t Very Long” also has the same brand of lonesome 
country that Willie Nelson is known for. While “Things to Remember” 
is a self-deprecating — even sarcastic — spin on pining heartbreak. In 
the song, Nelson makes an amusing list, “Things to remember/ Plans 
that were set/ Things didn’t work out/ Things to forget,” the lament all 
too relatable. I was also surprised to find a rendition of Patsy Cline’s 
hit “Crazy” — only to find later Nelson himself originally that “Crazy.”
But what’s most striking about the album isn’t solely that the songs 
are good — which they are — or its hidden gem status (due to criminal 
under-promotion by the label). Rather, that the album acts as a time 
capsule for the start of Willie Nelson’s career. These songs symbolize 
the beginning of a musical career that would define the country and 
rock ‘n’ roll genres. Here, it’s a man, his guitar, and a dream to make 
it big. And Nelson, like maybe country artists before him, game “late” 
to the game, a family man with some life 
experience already under his belt. Despite 
the youth and vibrancy of his voice, the 
pain and regret eternalized in all country 
songs is ever-present.
Willie Nelson has been a well-loved 
friend for many. His music is there for 
heartbreak, for the lonesome cowboys, and 
the travelling friends “On the Road Again.” 
In the end, though, listening to The Demos 
Project feels like a proper introduction. 
Willie Nelson with his trusty guitar and 
rockin’ pigtail-braids seems like a constant 
fixture in the industry and the country 
genre. As his career stretched into what 
may be the last home run, it is all too fitting 
to go back to the beginning, at least one 
more time.

What I’m Listening To: Willie Nelson, aren’t you?

MUSIC: WHAT I’M LISTENING TO

MADELEINE GANNON
Daily Arts Writer

Twenty years after a high 
school clique was involved in an 
incident that led to the gruesome 
death of one of their members, 
a series of mysterious deaths — 
suicide, accident or otherwise — 
threatens to reduce their circle to 
zero. One thing is clear: 
Someone knows.
Allie Garvey was the 
odd one out in the group. 
At 15, her sister died of 
cystic fibrosis and her 
mother was depressed. She 
wasn’t pretty like Sasha 
Barrow, athletic like David 
Hybrinski or even as rich 
as Julian Browne. Allie 
was linked to the popular 
kids by a secret. After Allie 
twisted her ankle while running, 
Allie happens upon Sasha then 
Julian and David, innocuously 
fiddling with something under a 
tree. It was a .38 revolver. By all 
rights, a gun incites fear. How 
could it not? For Allie, who was 
still grieving the premature death 
of her sister, it did. With Julian 
and Sasha — two privileged teens 
— it was an object that elicited 
excitement. For them, it was a toy. 
When a new kid, Kyle Gallagher, 
moves to this upscale Philadelphia 
suburb, the clique decides to 
play a game of Russian Roulette 
using their newfound toy. It was 
supposed to be a prank — the gun 
wasn’t supposed to be loaded — 
but it goes horribly wrong. Two 
decades later, Allie Garvey returns 
to her childhood home to mourn 

the death of a childhood friend 
and unearth the truth of what 
really happened that horrific night 
so long ago. In her investigations 
of the past, she uncovers a gut-
wrenching secret. A secret that 
could jeopardize her own life.
Lisa 
Scottoline’s 
“Someone 
Knows” is split into two parts. 
The first half is set in the 1990s 

and the second is in present-day. 
For close to 200 hundred pages, 
the readers are immersed in the 
minds of five 15-year-olds. While 
I find the idea of kids doing bad 
things shockingly delicious, the 
juvenile tone and their weighty 
issues don’t quite align. On one 
hand, each teenager is dealing 
with something heavy, from child 
molestation to a philandering 
father. The rotating perspectives 
functions to add depth to each 
character. Still, the issues are 
interspersed with stereotypical 
generalizations. 
For 
example, 
Allie Garvey claims she’s different 
because she doesn’t fit with 
any of the “cliques” like “pretty 
princesses, 
the 
field-hockey 
jocks, the fast girls who smoked, 
the Goths, druggies, mathletes, 

or Ecology-Club hippies.” It’s a 
superficial insight that’s more apt 
for a young-adult novel than a dark 
thriller.
In spite of that, it was hard to 
abandon “Someone Knows.” It 
was like watching a car-crash in 
action. You know that it would 
end terribly, yet you still can’t peel 
your eyes away. I was gripping the 
edges of the novel, hoping 
that all the characters 
would be OK yet knowing 
they won’t.
The 
second 
half 
forgoes the wonderful 
slow-tension that the first 
built up. The readers are 
still 
offered 
alternating 
perspectives, but it relies 
heavily on the point-of-
view of a new character, 
Larry 
Rucci, 
Allie’s 
husband. Unfortunately, the new 
perspective squeezes unnecessary 
background 
information 
that 
wasn’t relevant to the first half. 
Once again, the readers are 
reintroduced to another internal 
conflict and backstory at the 
expense of the plot. The effect 
results in a rushed and dramatic 
ending. Instead of dropping my 
mouth open in astonishment, I’m 
left wondering if I just watched a 
Lifetime movie special.
If you’re looking to read a cheap 
thriller on your next domestic 
flight, Lisa Scottoline’s “Someone 
Knows” includes all the typical 
tropes: suspense, murder, marital

I’m a sucker for a horse movie. Growing up, classics like “Black 
Beauty” and “Spirit” and low-budget family flicks like “Virginia’s 
Run” and “Dreamer” were staples in my cinematic diet. In my 
preteen years, I was one of those “horse girls.” I took riding lessons 
after school, begged my parents for a pony and, admittedly, even 
had a few pieces of horse-themed clothing in my closet. Though 
I’ve since sworn off ever pulling on another pair of riding breeches 
and I no longer dream of having a pet horse named Stormy or Star, 
I’m almost always up for a horse movie. While a bit heavier than the 
lighthearted, inspiring films from my childhood, “The Mustang” 
was a pleasant surprise with its impressive acting and unimposing, 
quietly profound story.
For the past 12 years, Roman Coleman’s (Matthias Schoenaerts 
“Far from the Madding Crowd”) life has been suspended in the 
soul-crushing limbo of prison. Existing in a state of blankness and 
solitude, as he puts it himself, Coleman is far from the man he used 
to be. His emotionless daze is interrupted, however, when he gets 
an opportunity to join a government rehabilitation program to curb 
the overpopulation of wild mustangs by training them and readying 
them for resale. Despite his lack of experience, Coleman slowly 
forms a connection with an especially wild mustang, Marcus. 
Through his relationship with Marcus and the other inmates in the 
program, Coleman rediscovers a slice of the purpose formerly lost 
within the void of the hopeless and hostile prison environment.
Matthias Schoenaerts was 100 percent made for this role. There 
are few actors who can give a masterful performance without 
relying on the crutch of dialogue and Schoenaerts proves he is one of 

them. Fully embodying Coleman’s disinterest in human interaction, 
outbreaks of aggression and complicated relationship with his 
daughter, Schoenaerts expertly conveys both his character’s quiet, 
subdued exterior and emotionally heated and broken interior.
We would guess that the interactions between Coleman and 
Marcus would look more like soliloquies than dialogues. But 

they aren’t. Instead of sharing words, Coleman and Marcus share 
movement. Through the way Marcus positions himself away 
or toward Coleman and the sounds of annoyance or gestures of 
affection he makes, we don’t miss the dialogue because we realize 
we don’t need it. This synchronized body language established 
between Coleman and the mustang is a form of communication in 
itself, and it allows us to perceive Marcus as an actual character, 
with feelings and an attitude, rather than as just an animal. 
What’s more, the relationship is refreshing, straying from the 

over-affectionate and cheesy characteristics that are typically 
highlighted on screen between horses and humans.
Aside from Schoenaerts’s acting, in tune with the low-key vibe of 
the film, the use of setting to showcase an unseen side of prison life 
is especially impressive. Throughout the film, there is a tug of war 
of sorts between sweet and bitter. We follow the pivotal friendship 
between Coleman and Marcus, contrasted with the bleak reality of 
the prison system. In one moment, we are witnessing a tender or 
humorous exchange between Coleman and Marcus, and in the next 
we are sobered up through clips of an anger management session, 
where close up shots of prisoners solemnly revealing the contrast 
between the mere seconds it took to decide to commit their crimes 
with the years they now face as punishment. The juxtaposition 
between these two sequences builds on the larger theme of 
confinement that encompasses the film. Outside on Marcus’s back, 
Coleman literally holds the reins in his hands. He is in control. But, 
back within the prison walls, Coleman is incapacitated, with his 
hands tied behind his back. This later image is one that emerges 
again and again in prison films, a vision of handcuffs, convicts 
in orange jumpsuits, dismal living conditions and knifings in the 
yard. Though still including these conventional elements, “The 
Mustang” presents an unfamiliar twist to the prison narrative, 
painting a picture that is far more dynamic and, by extension, more 
humanizing.
Maybe it’s the former horse-girl in me talking, but this is, quite 
simply, a beautiful film. Though it revolves around the bond 
between Coleman and Marcus, at the center are deeper topics 
of broken families, the desolation of the criminal justice system 
and the human necessity for purpose. Delivering quality acting, 
powerful visuals and an untold story, “The Mustang” is not your 
average horse movie and it’s well worth the watch.

‘The Mustang’ isn’t just about horses, and it’s stunning

Question: 

What goes 
great with your 
morning coffee?

Answer: 

michigandaily.com

Concertos for two pianos and 
orchestra are somewhat rare, 
maybe because it seems like 
such overkill. The conventional 
piano 
concerto 
stages 
a 
dialogue (or a competition, or 
a fight) between the orchestra 
and the soloist, which can 
usually nearly match, or at least 
analogize, the orchestra in 
power and scope. It’s less clear 
what a concerto for two pianos 
is really accomplishing by the 
addition of the third character 
— a piano duet, by itself, can 
accommodate nearly any piece 
of orchestral music. Many pre-
20th-century examples of the 
form simply trade the role of the 
soloist between the two pianists, 
leaving whichever player not 
playing the prominent role 
to fill in gaps in the texture 
or mirror the orchestra. One 
recent example of the form, 
Philip Glass’s double concerto, 
works in part because Glass’s 
style tends to be more planar 
than dialogic — the piece plays 
interlocking masses of sound 
off each other. Glass uses the 
piano not as an analogue for an 
orchestra, but something like 
mallet percussion.
A 
younger 
composer 

who 
borrows 
heavily 
from 
the 
minimalist 
tradition 
that 
Glass 
helped 
create is Bryce 
Dessner, 
whose 
latest 
set 
of 
recordings 
includes 
a 
concerto 
for 
two 
pianos 
played 
by 
the 
French duo Katia 
and 
Marielle 
Labèque. 
This 
piece splits the 
difference 
between 
Glass’s 
static, rhythmically inflected 
style and the more narrative 
concerto tradition, balancing a 
sense of thematic development 
with a bright, clear harmonic 
language and motoric rhythms. 
Dessner doesn’t shy away from 
the intricate, nearly overloaded 
textures 
that 
are 
possible 
with the instrumentation, and 
the spontaneity with which 
he 
combines 
themes 
and 
gestures is thrilling. Phrases 
ricochet around the orchestra, 
woodwinds scribble around the 
edges of phrases, abrupt shifts 
in texture and color abound. It’s 
like a liquid minimalism, just as 
likely to disperse into skittering 
phrases as it is to condense into 
a stampeding rush.
The 
second 
piece 
on 
the 
album, “Haven,” 
is 
scored 
for 
piano duet and 
two 
guitars, 
played here by 
the 
Labèques, 
Dessner 
and 
the 
guitarist 
David 
Chalmin. 
“Haven” 
is 
a 
much 
more 
restrained 
form 
of music than the 
piano 
concerto, 
and 
carries 
a 
superficial 

similarity to the earlier, pulse-
driven form of minimalism 
from the late 1960s. Like much 
minimalist music before it, it 
establishes a basic, repeated 
shape that then accumulates 
and disperses dissonance, like 
a river flowing over rocks. 
“Haven” 
doesn’t 
have 
the 
monomaniacal 
intensity 
of 
early Glass and Reich, though 
— it’s rather sectional, and can 
be read as following an overall 
A-B-A structure, like a sonata. 
Similar to the piano concerto, 
Dessner 
uses 
minimalism 
as a stylistic resource that 
can be channeled into more 
conventional forms.
“El Chan” is the final piece on 
the album, for piano duet. The 
set of miniatures are dedicated 
to Alejandro González Iñárritu, 
who Dessner worked with on 
the expansive score for The 
Revenant. Dessner’s language 
acquires 
a 
slightly 
more 
ominous, but still luminous, 
cast: dissonances accumulate in 
clouds above triads and seventh 
chords, frenetic gestures are 
cut short by bass hammer-
strokes. The music feels more 
differentiated, a jagged, misty 
landscape. The final piece, 
subtitled 
“Mountain,” 
ends 
with a series of slow, widely 
spaced chords, not suggesting 
tension or resolution but simply 
hanging, suspended.

Before attending Assistant 
Professor José Casas’s “Flint,” 
I had already decided that I 
really wanted to like it. The 
premise of the play — a “call to 
action,” as the author describes 
it, meant to inform audience 
members of the Flint water 
crisis — seemed noble and 
highly important.
While the play did have its 
poignant, powerful moments, it 
lacked the focus and clarity to 
bring them home. The disparity 
of the many narratives in the 
play all but eliminated any 
overarching themes that might 
be drawn from the crisis, 
reducing a complex crisis into 
a series of heart-wrenching 
individual problems.
To 
understand 
these 
problems, 
one 
must 
first 
understand the basic structure 
of the play. It consisted of a 
series of monologues and duets 
in which people affected by 
the Flint water crisis spoke 
to the audience about their 
experiences. Over the course 
of the 
evening, we 
heard 
from 
various 
concerned 
stakeholders: a professor, an 
Autoworld worker, a deliver 
guy, an attorney and a nurse.
Though this technique was 
interesting at first, it eventually 
became cumbersome. I found 
myself wishing that characters 
would 
interact 
with 
each 
other at some point — that 
some character evolution or 
continuity 
between 
scenes 
and characters would begin to 
develop.
Furthermore, 
at 
many 
points, the dialogue resulting 

from this narrative structure 
began to feel awkward and 
preachy. The play began to 
feel as though it were a series 
of interviews with unrelated 
subjects, each one addressing 
the audience to detail the 
horrible 
effects 
that 
the 
crisis had on their life. The 
great disparity between the 
messages of these characters, 
however, diluted any central 
narrative or take away that 
might have developed.
Despite this, the acting talent 
on display was impressive. Any 
scene requiring a monologue 
usually becomes a staple of 
an actor’s repertoire; in this 
instance, the cast was required 
to perform two or three quasi-
monologues each. Each member 
of the cast excelled in this 
regard, consistently breaking 
the fourth wall and speaking 
seemingly 
extemporaneously 
to the audience without losing 
the audience’s attention.
The opening and closing 
ensemble 
numbers, 
for 
example, 
were 
absolutely 
stunning. 
In 
the 
opening, 
various 
members 
of 
the 
ensemble doubled each other‘s 
dialogues about the crisis. 
These were short, powerful 
statements meant to capture 
the lasting effects of this crisis. 
And near the end, as water 
flowed out of the pipes on the 
edges of the stage, the cast’s 
violent motions and groaning 
noises were truly horrifying; of 
everything in the play, this is 
the moment that stuck with me 
as I left the theater.
The set was very impressive: 
A chain-link fence stuffed full 
of dirtied water bottles framed 
the stage while dark brown 
pipes flanked the back left and 

right portions of the stage. 
During the intermission, these 
pipes were uncapped — in the 
ensemble scene, a slow trickle 
of water dripped from them 
into giant oil barrels.
A few of the narratives 
were particularly moving. The 
Attorney’s complaints about 
potentially moving trials to 
majority-white counties, for 
example, 
was 
particularly 
captivating. 
The 
Gardener 
and Socialist were also quite 
powerful, as the Gardener 
spoke 
of 
the 
peace 
that 
gardening brought him, the 
Socialist spoke of the damages 
that lead and other foreign 
substances can have to plants 
grown in contaminated soil.
The last minutes of the 
play, however, were its most 
powerful. In this monologue, 
a woman of color speaks to the 
audience about the cultural 
expectations 
that 
mothers 
(and mothers of color) face in 
speaking about this crisis. At 
one point, she tells the audience 
that “this play is over.” As the 
house lights abruptly turned 
on, she admonished us to listen 
to these stories and respond to 
them — to act on what we had 
heard and help be part of the 
solution.
In the end, I found myself 
wishing that the whole play 
had been this commanding. 
And while I applaud Prof. 
Casas’s 
ambitions 
on 
this 
project, I cannot say that it 
entirely lived up to what I had 
hoped for. Ultimately, it was a 
lengthy, slightly-disorganized 
rumination on the hazardous 
effects of the Flint water crisis 
— an incredibly important 
play, though not the most well-
executed attempt.

‘Flint’ is an ambitious play
that does not hit the mark

Megan Bascom and Nicole 
Reehort’s “Intersections” MFA 
Dance Thesis Concert explored 
themes of isolation, empathy 
and personal aspiration in the 
groups we find ourselves in 
on a daily basis. In Reehorst’s 
“Playing 
Dead,” 
a 
female 
protagonist 
navigates 
the 
practice of classical ballet, a 
journey that forces her to be 
both gentle and aggressive, 
fragile yet enduring. Bascom’s 
“ReGuarding,” on the other 
hand, 
has 
no 
protagonist. 
Instead, a group of dancers 
move around an obstacle course 
of 
abstracted 
sculptures, 
with relationships among the 
dancers and their environment 
constantly in flux.
Drawing from their distinct 
backgrounds, the two Masters 
candidates made very different 
choreographic 
decisions. 
Reehort’s piece began with 
her protagonist standing still 
at stage center, lights slowly 
illuminating her face and then 
her body. As a classical piano 
began to play, two dancers 
rolled across from either sides 
of the stage, unfurling fabric 
that would eventually entangle 
the protagonist as she slowly 
began to move. Bascom’s piece, 
by contrast, began with a bright 
red screen suddenly providing 
back-lighting for five dancers 
standing 
tall 
across 
stage 
center. As distorted electric 
guitar began playing over an 
electronic beat, the dancers 
energetically ran about the 
stage until they suddenly all 
stomped the music and screen 
to a halt. These beginnings 

placed the audience in two very 
different places from the start: 
Reehorst’s 
piece 
demanded 
attention to subtlety, while 
Bacom’s simply had us along for 
the ride.
The stage design acted as an 
early indicator of the different 
approaches. Reehorst’s set was 
comprised of ropes made of 
beige-colored ballerina lingerie 
knotted together, Bascom’s set 
employed 
eight 
abstracted 
containers of wood and metal. 
While the lingerie referenced a 
long history of lingerie in ballet 
and represented the established 
norms that literally entangle 
the main dancer, the containers 
seem 
to 
symbolize 
the 
immaterial obstacles of urban 
life, as the cast continuously 
fights to overthrow them.
The 
biggest 
difference 
between 
the 
performances, 
however, seemed to be the 
use or omission of music and 
dialogue. 
Reehorst’s 
piece 
used music sparingly, allowing 
us to be intimately connected 
with the protagonist for most 
of the time. When music did 
play, it was classical piano 
that indicated the start of 
a 
performance 
within 
the 
performance 
itself. 
This 
omission of music when the 
ballerinas 
were 
“offstage” 
gave the piece a self-aware 
objectivity that wouldn’t have 
been communicated otherwise.
Bascom, on the other hand, 
made use of high octane music 
and dialogue throughout. If 
all five dancers seemed to be 
acting as a group — playing 
off each other in any number 
of ways — fast-paced music 
would serve to accentuate the 
frenzy. During moments when 
only one or two dancers acted 

as others watched on, slower, 
more atmospheric music would 
support this intimacy. In this 
way, the use rather than the 
omission of music supported 
much of the social commentary 
Bascom seemed to be making.
Despite these differences, 
the performances had a great 
deal 
of 
thematic 
overlap 
(hence, 
“Intersections”). 
Reehorst’s 
focused 
on 
the 
plight of a woman trying to 
establish herself in a ballet 
company, hence its more muted, 
introspective 
nature. 
This 
protagonist fails to integrate 
herself throughout, only finally 
noticing the web of lingerie 
at the end after a great deal 
of strenuous, inward-looking 
solo performance. It is only 
then that she joins the other 
dancers as they synchronously 
roll offstage to conclude the 
performance.
The dancers in Bascom’s 
performance 
seem 
equally 
aloof to the obstacles before 
them. They move the metal 
containers around throughout 
the show, at times using them 
as protective barriers but at 
others 
involuntarily 
being 
bound to their control. After 
much quarrel, the five original 
dancers, aided by a curious new 
group of three others, come 
to a collective understanding 
that these containers are the 
source of their angst. The 
show ends on much the same 
note as Reehort’s with the 
group 
coming 
together 
to 
aggressively 
abolish 
these 
obstacles offstage. Regardless 
of their differences, “Playing 
Dead” and “ReGuarding” offer 
cohesive individualistic and 
collective insights into our 
intricately intersecting lives.

P

resence.
It’s what Michigan 
coach Carol Hutchins 
credits for 
the No. 21 
Michigan 
softball 
team’s stark 
pivot after 
a rough 
start to the 
season. It’s 
what has 
allowed the 
Wolverines 
to slowly 
claw their way back from fall-
ing out of the rankings for the 
first time in almost 20 years. It’s 
what has propelled Michigan to a 
15-game win streak.
But, there’s still one major 
test left to pass: Whether the 
Wolverines’ offense has the 
staying power for a serious post-
season run. 
Michigan dug itself into a 
tough spot as the season began. 

By the third week, it was on an 
unprecedented five-game losing 
streak. While consistent pitch-
ing by sophomore left-hander 
Meghan Beaubien and strong 
defense kept the Wolverines in 
most games, Michigan struggled 
at the plate. In the 23 games 
before coming home, the Wol-
verines averaged less than four 
runs per game with a collective 
batting average of .210.
When asked what accounted 
for the lack of offensive produc-
tion, Hutchins and the players 
have cited everything from 
a poor mentality to a lack of 
patience at the plate.
Whatever the cause, their 
offensive struggles didn’t fol-
low them home. But the pres-
ence did. When the Wolverines 
returned to Alumni Field for 
their home opener on March 14, 
the bats started swinging.
Michigan has faced weaker 
competition in the past month, 
not facing a ranked opponent 

since March 7. Still, the Wol-
verines’ offense is inarguably 
stronger.
Their hot-streak started with 
an 8-0 run-rule against Kent 
State in the home opener and 
hasn’t stopped since. Michigan 
has racked up almost nine runs 
per game on average — more 
than double that of the begin-
ning of the season — and is bat-
ting .370 in the 15 games since 
being home.
Offensive standouts have 
emerged in the Wolverines’ 
lineup. Senior outfielder Nata-
lie Peters’s batting average has 
soared from a .250 average to 
its current .340, and junior 
third baseman Madison Uden’s 
on-base percentage has been 
steadily climbing since her bat-
ting average also took a dip early 
in the season. They’ve been 
present at the plate, and they’re 
just a few of many examples.
“(Power hitting) means we’re 
swinging with better confi-

dence,” Hutchins said on March 
17. “If there’s anything that’s 
improved, it’s our presence and 
our confidence. We’ve been a 
talented team all along, but now 
we’re playing with the confi-
dence we need.”
Almost every player’s batting 
average has improved — even 
those who were hitting relative-
ly well early on in the season. 
Freshman outfielder Lexie Blair 
and senior first baseman Alex 
Sobczak have become integral 
to Michigan’s offense, adding 
power to the lineup as the sea-
son has progressed with four 
and seven home runs respec-
tively. 
While home runs were few 
and far between early in the 
season, the Wolverines have hit 
at least one ball out of the park 
in each of the past 10 games, 
largely due to Blair and Sobc-
zak.
But there are shortcomings.
Throughout the season, 

Michigan’s offense has often 
fallen into a pattern: score sev-
eral runs in one or two innings 
and leave the others scoreless. 
This was true in the Wolverines’ 
matchup against No. 5 Washing-
ton on March 3 and remained 
true in all three of Michigan’s 
games the Hoosiers this week-
end, to name a few. 
The Wolverines have made it 
clear they’ve found the offensive 
power to carry them through 
the rest of Big Ten play — a con-
ference in a historic downturn 
— but with the postseason less 
than a month away, that might 
not be enough.
The offense has left runs on 
the table in each contest so far. 
This weekend alone, Michigan 
left 19 runners stranded on base 
against Indiana. They struggled 
to bring home runners in scor-
ing position, faltering on at-bats 
that could have solidified a 
stronger lead.
This problem isn’t new.

“We’ve been very inconsis-
tent, and especially in our RBI 
production,” Hutchins said on 
March 9. “We need to get better. 
We need to have a productive 
set in those at-bats.”
Success in the postseason 
could hinge on response to 
adversity.
In the face of strong pitching 
in the seventh inning of the Sun-
day’s game against Indiana, the 
Wolverines stayed locked in at 
the plate with three consecutive 
producing at-bats that allowed 
Michigan to edge out the Hoo-
siers in a walk-off double.
“We’re playing for May — and 
I don’t mean the beginning of 
May,” Hutchins said. “We’re 
playing to get to the end of May. 
It’s going to be hard but the only 
chance we have is with a team 
like the seventh inning.”

Michigan falls in extra innings

Willie Weiss stood on the 
mound with two outs. The 
freshman right-hander was close 
to finishing the top of the tenth 
inning and giving the Michigan 
baseball team another chance to 
beat Indiana State.
Instead, he let Jake Means 
grab a hold of his pitch and launch 
the ball over the left field fence to 
create an 8-7 lead.
They couldn’t come back, and 
Michigan dropped its second 
home game of the season, losing 
8-7 to the Sycamores due to the 
lack of a response in the last three 
innings.
For the first three innings, 
though, the same couldn’t be 
said. For every run Indiana State 
scored, the Wolverines had one of 
their own.
Despite 
freshman 
right-
hander Isaiah Paige letting in 
a patchwork run score via a 
single to go down one early, the 
Michigan offense had the young 
pitcher’s back. Two solo home 
runs to left field — one that 
scooped over the fence by leadoff 
sophomore 
designated 
hitter 
Jordan Nwogu and another by 
senior outfielder Miles Lewis 
that left the bat at 105 miles per 
hour — paved the way to put the 
Wolverines back on top.
“We’re capable,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich. “We have a 
really good slugging percentage, 
we have a lot of capable hitters. 
We’re not a bunt type team, it’s 
hard to put on a bunt when we’ve 
got guys who can tie the game in 
one swing.”
But the Sycamore offense 
quickly caught up to Paige’s 
pitches. Starting the inning by 
hitting Chris Ayers — Indiana 
State’s No. 9 hitter — Paige 
subsequently allowed a long 
double to Clay Dungan, the ball 
bouncing off a diving sophomore 
center-fielder Jesse Franklin’s 
glove, to put runners on second 
and third.
One out later Paige’s day was 

over. On came freshman left-
hander Walker Cleveland who 
gave up an intentional walk, hit 
the second batter of the inning 
and allow a second double to 
center-field — this time leading to 
three runs to grab a 5-2 lead.
Michigan’s 
offense, 
again, 
had an answer. After Blomgren’s 
four-pitch walk to load the 
bases, sophomore catcher Joe 
Donovan hit a single through 
left field to score two runs and 
bring the game within one run. 
After a walk from senior second 
baseman Ako Thomas to load the 
bases once again, up came Nwogu 
— who had already launched a 
home run on the day and was on a 
hot streak. He walked to score the 
tying run — it was 5-5.
“Someone scores four, we 
put up three,” Bakich said. 
“Psychologically, just to tie it back 
up again and when you’re playing 
from a deficit… To get that two-
out rally after giving up a four 
spot, that was huge. Huge in that 
moment.”
In 
the 
sixth 
inning, 
the 
Wolverines’ turn struck first. 
Thomas hit his second double of 
the day, this one a leadoff double 

to left center field, putting him 
in position to trot home after 
Franklin launched a homer into 
center field.
Then, run by run, Indiana 
State grew back into the game. A 
leadoff double from CJ Huntley 
and a ground ball put a runner 
on third, afterward junior left-
hander Ben Keizer threw a wild 
pitch to score Huntley. In the 
eighth inning, the Sycamores 
manufactured another.
“We 
just 
came 
up 
short 
tonight,” Bakich said. “And I trust 
those guys that are pitching there 
at the end of the game, just some 
bad bounces, some balls that 
squeak through, some balls that 
got by and allowed them to move 
up and advance on the bases — 
the little things that cost us.”
The 
Wolverines 
had 
no 
response. And Indiana State 
was just getting started before 
leveling the go-ahead run in the 
10th inning.
“It comes down to a swing, a 
pitch, a play,” Bakich said. “They 
just made one more better pitch 
and had one better swing and 
did everything just one bit better 
than us tonight.”

Cheer earns two national titles

Lis 
Tyzo-Depaulis 
stood 
near 
warm-ups 
at 
nationals, 
surrounded by Michigan’s Coed 
IA cheer team. The head assistant 
coach was streaming the Game 
Day IA award ceremony on her 
phone, waiting to see if the other 
half of the Wolverines’ team would 
be taking home a title from the 
NCA & NDA Collegiate Cheer and 
Dance Championship.
The Game Day team was in 
second place after the previous 
day’s preliminary round, 4.45 
points 
behind 
a 
Southern 
Methodist 
team 
that 
topped 
the charts with a 97.53. But a 
pristine routine on Friday left 
the squad questioning if they’d 
closed the gap for their first title 
in program history, while the 
Coed team huddled around Tyzo-
Depaulis’ phone waiting for the 
announcement. 
Meghan 
Mesojedec, 
a 
co-captain for the Coed IA team 
along with Deontay Walker, said 
it felt like it took about 30 seconds 
for the announcer to reveal the 
runner-up — which might seem 
like an eternity 
when 
you’re 
waiting 
on 
a 
potential national 
championship. 
“You 
had 
to wait for the 
‘s’,” 
Mesojedec 
said. “Once they 
said 
‘Southern,’ 
everyone 
was 
freaking out, they 
were so excited 
that they won.”
That national title for the Game 
Day team, captained by Alex 
Bourdeau, Paige Pichel and Joey 
Solomon, left the Coed squad 
pumped up as they headed into 
their second round. They couldn’t 
have been more ready for their 
final routine in Daytona, for more 
reasons than one.
There are two rounds in the 
NCA & NDA Collegiate Cheer 
and Dance Championships — the 

preliminary and the final. In the 
preliminary, a fall or a bobble 
means a point deduction that can 
creep back in the final round. The 
past few years, that’s been the 
scenario for Michigan’s Coed IA 
team.
Not this year. 
“This year, at prelims, the entire 
routine hit,” Mesojedec said. “We 
were able to finish it with a clean 
hit, and we were just so excited 
to go out there and do it again on 
Friday.”
The Wolverines posted the best 
score 
in 
their 
category 
on 
Thursday with a 
97.57, edging out 
East 
Carolina. 
Another hit on 
Friday wouldn’t 
just mean a win 
in their category, 
either. It’d give 
Michigan 
its 
second national 
title in less than 
a few hours.
A 
flawless 
routine 
of 
tumbling passes, pyramids and 
choreography 
left 
the 
team 
celebrating louder than it had all 
night. It was exactly what it needed 
to cap off a lead over the Pirates. 
The Coed squad didn’t want to 
presume they’d won — but there 
was no doubt they’d just had one of 
the best performances of the night.
“You don’t want to assume 
necessarily, because you don’t 

want to jinx yourself, but we — I 
think we did,” Mesojedec said. “We 
just knew we put the best routine 
out there that we could have, and 
so we were just so excited at that 
point to get through awards and 
hear where we were. We were so 
happy with what we put out there 
that we thought it couldn’t be any 
less than a winning routine.”
The Coed’s final score of 98.0917 
earned the collective Michigan 
unit its second championship 
trophy of the night, marking 
a historical moment for the 
team. After splitting into the 
two categories early in the year, 
the squads began working on 
choreography and collaborating 
with the band and dance team 
to work out a Game Day routine. 
After the Peach Bowl, it had been 
full throttle, with each team 
practicing four days a week with 
lifts tacked on. 
Both 
had 
been 
working 
intensely for month, and the titles 
were the payoff. 
“It was so special for us to do 
this for us, and for Michigan,” 
Mesojedec said. “You love going 
to this school that you do, so to do 
it and to just have our school be so 
excited for us and our friends and 
other students be so excited for us 
— and our programs even, like the 
School of Information, the School 
of Kinesiology.
“It’s so cool to go to a school that 
appreciates us so much and we 
were so happy to win for them.”

What’s the role of the tight end in 
Gattis’ “speed in space” offense

In 2017, Sherrone Moore 
— then an assistant coach at 
Central Michigan — helped 
facilitate an offensive overhaul. 
The 
Chippewas’ 
hiring 
of 
Chris Ostrowsky as offensive 
coordinator 
prompted 
a 
schematic 
shift, 
from 
a 
traditional pro-style offense to 
a spread.
Moore, who coached the tight 
ends as part of his duties, had to 
make the requisite adjustments.
Sound familiar?
Two years later, the hiring 
of Josh Gattis as Michigan’s 
offensive coordinator has put 
Moore in a similar position. 
Talk of Gattis’ “speed in space” 
mantra has enveloped much of 
the spring oxygen, implicitly 
and explicitly promising more. 
Faster tempo. More big plays. 
More opportunities for skill guys. 
Production against the best. 
Maybe, oh maybe, some big wins.
So, 
how 
does 
the 
tight 
end — a hallmark position in 
Michigan’s pro-style offenses 
under Harbaugh — fit into that 
equation? That’s the question 
Gattis and Moore are tasked 
with answering, ahead of a 
summer filled with intrigue and 
uncertainty aplenty regarding 
the offense as a whole. Moore 
believes his experience making 
a similar transition at Central 
Michigan in 2017 can help 
instruct his parallel task in 2019.
“When I was at Central we 
went from a pro offense to a 
true spread offense,” Moore 
said. “So I’ve been through 

the adjustments and making 
the kinks of having to coach 
this position and having to go 
from, you’re always doing one 
thing to switching up and doing 
different things.”
That 
year, 
the Chippewas 
went 
from 
the 
84th-best 
offense in the 
country to the 
64th. They won 
eight games for 
the first time 
in eight years. 
And, pertinent 
to Moore, their 
tight end Tyler 
Conklin posted 504 yards and 
five 
touchdowns, 
parlaying 
that season into a fifth-round 
NFL Draft selection. (An aside: 
Central Michigan’s quarterback 
that season? Shane Morris).
That past experience is only 
part of the equation informing 
Moore’s task of transitioning 
the tight end group to Gattis’ 
“pro spread” offense. Moore 
said Tuesday that he spent the 
offseason studying Alabama’s 
offense. Regular collaboration 
with Gattis also has been 
integral toward smoothing out 
kinks thus far.
“He didn’t really come in and 
say, ‘Hey, we’re going to do this,’ 
” Moore recalled. “He said ‘this 
is not my offense, this is our 
offense.’ ”
That ultimate product, as with 
any scheme, will be beholden 
to its personnel. Visions of 
Alabama 
All-American 
tight 
end Irv Smith Jr. shredding 
defenses as a mismatch tight 

end out wide are inevitably 
restricted by the fact that junior 
Nick Eubanks, for all his merits, 
is not there yet. Perception that 
junior Sean McKeon can slot 
into the Conklin role ignores 
the reality that 
McKeon doesn’t 
have 
Conklin’s 
versatility.
Still, 
despite 
losing 
Zach 
Gentry 
to 
the 
draft, 
the 
Wolverines 
have the depth 
and 
talent 
to 
meld the group 
into a strength. 
Eubanks, 
who has just 
10 
career catches, has the athletic 
potential to thrive in a more 
spread 
out 
scheme. 
Moore 
singled out McKeon as an 
improved 
receiver, 
noting 
he “hasn’t dropped a pass in 
practice.” Early-enrollee Eric 
All has turned heads in the early 
going, highlighting Saturday’s 
open practice with a 30-yard 
catch along the sideline after 
beating the corner.
“It’s all about your personnel 
and what you can do with the 
guys you have,” Moore said. “So 
it’s been really helpful that I 
know the guys — from a physical 
standpoint what they can do 
on the field. And then from a 
personal 
standpoint, 
getting 
to know them a little more, 
since I’ve been here a year, it’s 
helped.”
Coaches and players have 
already noted some growing 
pains 
within 
the 
scheme 
change. 
The 
tight 
ends, 
Eubanks said, are no different.
“Knowing 
all 
the 
assignments (has been the 
biggest 
adjustment), 
as 
in 
lining up outside and inside 
and knowing all the concepts 
on offense,” Eubanks said. “It’s 
been a big lesson for me to do 
that, and I’m taking advantage 
of that right now.”
In terms of specifics, his 
answer implies the tight ends 
will play a more versatile role. 
Eubanks, for example, could 
more frequently line up out 
wide. Presumably, the spread 
scheme will de-emphasize the 
two-tight end sets that heavily 
populated prior offenses.
Still, 
until 
real 
game-
settings arive, it will all remain 
speculation.
Through all the anticipation, 
uncertainty 
and 
semblance 
of 
collaboration, 
Eubanks 
distilled the platonic ideal of 
Michigan’s offense — and, by 
proxy, the role of the tight end 
— down to two short sentences 
last week.
“Coaches 
are 
giving 
an 
opportunity for the playmakers 
to make plays,” he said.
“That’s 
what 
(Gattis) 
is 
emphasizing on offense.”

Brazdeikis, Poole and Matthews 
to hire agents, enter NBA Draft

Ignas 
Brazdeikis 
will 
attempt 
to 
become 
John 
Beilein’s first ever one-and-
done.
The freshman forward told 
ESPN’s Jonathan Givony on 
Tuesday afternoon that he 
will hire an agent and enter 
the NBA Draft. And he’ll be 
followed by Jordan Poole and 
Charles Matthews. All three 
intend to sign with agents, per 
a release from the program.
“Charles, Jordan and Iggy 
have all decided to take the next 
steps in pursuing their dreams 
of playing in the NBA,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein, 
per the release. “The new 
process is a unique experience 
and one that my staff and I will 
assist in every way we can. We 
want each of them to utilize 
this opportunity to get more 
feedback so they can make 
the best decision possible for 
themselves and their families. 
All three are remarkable young 

men with amazing futures in 
front on them.”
After Michigan’s loss in the 
Sweet Sixteen to Texas Tech, 
Matthews was widely expected 
to declare for the draft and stay 
in it. Those inside the program 
openly acknowledged that it 
would be his last year in Ann 
Arbor, and Matthews was even 
honored on senior night despite 
having a year of eligibility left.
“Many people have known 
about 
my 
desire 
to 
play 
professionally, and my family 
and I are blessed to begin that 
process again,” Matthews said, 
per the release.
Brazdeikis and Poole, on the 
other hand, were both expected 
to at least test the waters. Based 
on ESPN’s report, it seems that 
Brazdeikis is gone for good.
“My intent is to be drafted 
this year as high as I can be,” 
Brazdeikis told ESPN.
The 
freshman 
was 
Michigan’s 
leading 
scorer 
and Big Ten Freshman of the 
Year. Per ESPN, he will be 
represented by YouFirst Sports.

As of publication, Brazdeikis 
has not responded to a text 
from The Daily.
The Wolverines have had 
players good enough to leave 
after one year during the 
Beilein era, namely Trey Burke, 
but none have. At least until 
now.
After 
Michigan 
lost 
to 
Texas 
Tech 
in 
the 
Sweet 
Sixteen, Brazdeikis and Poole 
were mum about a potential 
decision, but this will come as 
no surprise.
It’s less clear whether Poole 
will stay in the draft than the 
other two. Thanks to new rules 
changes, players can now hire 
agents and still withdraw from 
the draft if they so decide.
“Being able to play in the 
NBA has always been my dream 
since I was young,” Poole said 
in the release. “I am confident 
that with my faith in God 
and hard work that I, and my 
family, are prepared to look at 
all options and make the right 
decision for the next step of my 
playing career.”

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily
Charles Matthews, Ignas Brazdeikis and Jordan Poole, who all entered the draft, were Michigan’s top three scorers.

McKeon, others stepping up

After completing a drill in 
practice earlier this spring, senior 
linebacker Khaleke Hudson went 
up to Sherrone Moore with one 
thought to share.
“Man, (Sean McKeon)’s gotten 
so much better,” Hudson told 
Moore.
Just six months ago, the senior 
tight end hit a low as he let a 25-yard 
pass against Northwestern slip 
through his hands, continuing his 
early-season troubles and giving 
the Wildcats — already up 10-0 — 
possession at midfield. When the 
Wolverines got the ball back, Nick 
Eubanks lined up as their second 
tight end, behind Zach Gentry.
Over the rest of the season, 
McKeon 
managed 
just 
eight 
receptions for 60 yards, falling well 
short of the expectations he set for 
himself after a 31-reception, 301-
yard sophomore season in 2017. 
Gentry, meanwhile, finished his 
final season third on the team with 
541 yards.
On Jan. 2, though, Gentry 
declared for the NFL Draft, 
opening the door for competition to 
fill his void, though the tight ends’ 
role could decrease in Michigan’s 
spread offense under new offensive 
coordinator Josh Gattis. Whatever 
the role, McKeon has taken full 
advantage.
“Sean as a blocker’s been really 
good as he’s always been,” Moore 
said. “But his receiving ability 
(has improved), catching the ball 
in traffic, making the competitive 
catches. … It’s a credit to him and 
what he’s done this offseason. He 
hasn’t had any drops, he’s gonna 
catch the ball, he’s gonna make 
the competitive catches. I’m really 
proud of him as a receiver.”
McKeon’s impact has been felt 
far beyond the tight ends room 
this offseason. Tuesday afternoon, 
redshirt senior left tackle Jon 
Runyan Jr. was asked which of the 
tight ends has been most impressive 
in Gentry’s absence.
His response came without 
hesitation: 
“Definitely 
Sean 
McKeon.
“He’s 
kinda 
just 
like 
the 
stalwart of the tight ends, just does 
everything right.”

Amid the deepest receiving 
group Jim Harbaugh has had at 
Michigan, McKeon’s ability to 
follow through on such praise 
will be critical in Shea Patterson’s 
ability to follow through on his 
senior-year expectations.
“If you want to try to stop Sean, 
then you’re gonna have to deal 
with Donovan,” Moore said. “If 
you stop Donovan, you’re gonna 
have to deal with Nico. Then you’re 
gonna have to deal with Nick, then 
you’re gonna have to deal with 
all the other guys that we’ve got. 
So Sean’s really taken the part of 
trying to be that security blanket 
for (Patterson).”
The competition to replace 
Gentry’s targets, though, goes past 
McKeon and further into that 
talented receiving group.
Eubanks, always a downfield 
threat with a career average of 
21.8 yards per reception, has seen 
limited playing time over his first 
three years thanks to limited 
blocking skills. That has become a 
focus for Moore this offseason.
“Eubanks is really coming into 
his own as a blocker,” Runyan said. 
“And that’s really something that 
we need with him and Sean in our 
tight end sets and that’s gonna be 
really beneficial down the road.”
Redshirt freshman Mustapha 
Muhammad, a four-star recruit 
in 2017, has shown Moore flashes 
akin to his high school film after 
not being able to practice much 
a year ago. Luke Schoonmaker, a 

three-star in the same class, was 
also mentioned by Moore when 
asked about the Wolverines’ young 
tight ends.
But no matter to whom that 
question was posed, Erick All’s 
name was the prevailing response.
All, a four-star early enrollee 
from Fairfield, Ohio, possesses 
many of the pass-catching skills 
that Michigan lost in Gentry, 
regularly 
practicing 
with 
the 
Wolverines’ wide receivers. When 
freshman 
quarterback 
Cade 
McNamara 
wooed 
Michigan 
Stadium with a perfect deep ball at 
Saturday’s open practice, it was All 
on the receiving end.
And Tuesday afternoon, when 
asked about the tight ends’ role 
in a crowded receiving corps, 
Moore tossed out a comparison to 
freshman receiver Mike Sainstrill, 
the star of spring ball.
“The 
young 
guys, 
young 
receivers, people talked about 
Mikey (Sainstrill), people talked 
about (sophomore) Ronnie Bell,” 
Moore said. “But especially Mikey 
and Erick (All), those guys have 
really stepped up for being kids 
fresh out of high school.”
Of course, all of this is just talk 
shrouded in the reputation that 
is Michigan’s signature offseason 
optimism, and the extent to which 
the public has seen Shea Patterson 
without Gentry came in a handful of 
7-on-7 drills on Saturday.
But with five months until 
kickoff, it sure beats the alternative.

W 
 

e parked in front of that 
pristine white building with 
Roman columns surrounded 
by trees where all the kids were lounging 
on blankets and blasting Jack Johnson. 
Somewhere over that way past the cute 
coffee shop,” I claimed to my mom as we 
tried to find our way back to the car after 
moving into my dorm and taking a stroll 
downtown.
“It was two buildings down, a right, 
another right, and 15 feet forward,” my 
sister Clara countered.
I really want to scream in her face and 
walk away when she argues like this. It 
exemplifies perfectly what polar oppo-
sites we are. I see the world in colors, 
sounds and emotion (I even cry in the 
first few minutes of “Frozen” every time). 
Meanwhile, she’s meticulous, practical 
and painfully literal. She’s very straight 
edge and sees an answer to everything. 
I’ve always been the creative one who 
loves reading and writing, and she’s 
always been the science and math whiz. 
I’m the social one, or as she would say, the 
loud one. I take laps around rooms to talk 
to everyone and laugh so loudly I can be 
heard across the room. She’s extremely 
shy and introverted, usually waiting to be 
approached but becoming extremely close 
to a select few.
If we could combine our powers and 
fuse into one body, we’d be a superhuman.
The problem isn’t that we don’t get 
along, but that we simply don’t speak to 
each other. Growing up, we rarely inter-
acted because we had absolutely nothing 
in common. We live our own lives, and 
because our brains are wired differently, 
it’s hard to converse. This isn’t what I 
expected when I was told I was going to 
be an older sister. I thought having a sis-
ter meant slumber parties and a built-in 
movie night buddy, and that’s why it frus-
trates me so much when I say it’s 2:00 
p.m. and she corrects me that it’s 2:07 
p.m. Similarly, she can’t understand why 
I’m always singing at the top of my lungs 
in the house or talking nonstop in the car. 
Her penchant for preciseness and her 
reserved personality contradicts every-
thing I stand for. And because we don’t 
understand each other, we silently agree 
to simply ignore each other. This has been 
our mutual understanding for years.
She doesn’t often come up in conver-

sation, so people in college are often sur-
prised to learn I have a sister. They’re 
more surprised when they see a picture 
of her and realize we don’t even look like 
we’re from the same family. I explain that 
our relationship has always been a bit 
icy. Growing up, my teachers and family 
members kept swearing we would become 
best friends one day and that we would 
look back and laugh at our younger selves. 
I was told over and over again that sisters, 
even if their relationship starts off rocky 
or they fight until they pull each other’s 
hairs out, always become inseparable...
eventually.

Yet during college, we still only gave 
each other quick waves whenever I came 
home for break. I didn’t feel the over-
whelming inseparability we were told we 
would develop as we matured. We didn’t 
text each other about our personal lives, 
share secrets and bond like sister soul-
mates should. I felt like something was 
wrong with me. Who doesn’t miss their 
own sister?
Then came the first update about some-
thing annoying our mom was doing. I 
would chuckle, send a text back, maybe 
even share a funny joke I had heard earli-
er that week. She would send me videos of 
our baby cousins, and bake maize and blue 
sugar cookies when I came home for the 

summer. I would drive her to the mall and 
draw out of her a couple stories about her 
friends and her new job at the ice cream 
shop. The longer I was away from home, 
the more we seemed to communicate.
During my senior year, she finally vis-
ited me on campus. We did the usual 
rounds of tailgates, Blank Slate, introduc-
tions to friends and Frita Batidos. We did 
everything we could possibly do on cam-
pus, expended all our energy and by Sun-
day afternoon, she was gone.
The crazy thing was that when she left, 
I really missed her. I returned to my apart-
ment and I could see she had left her hair 

tie on my desk, just like I do everywhere I 
go. My room felt a little empty and I real-
ized how much I had liked having her 
around. She had a reassuring presence, 
as she would sit quietly and keep me com-
pany as I panicked to do the homework I 
hadn’t done while hanging out with her 
all day. She had a cheerful disposition, 
always happy to meet my friends and nod 
along as I tried to brainwash her for hours 
on why she should go here for college.
It was the little things that gave me 
comfort. I liked knowing that when we 
ordered food, we’d be picking two dif-
ferent things and automatically sharing 
— that I would probably get something 
sweet and she would get something 

savory and we’d be excited to try both. I 
remembered that when I ate the choco-
late part of a black and white cookie she 
would eat the white part, which I didn’t 
like. We had scarfed down a large feta 
bread and I had felt no judgment from her. 
When she entered the apartment, she had 
immediately taken her shoes off because 
our mom would have killed us otherwise. 
I opened up my laptop to catch up on all 
the studying I hadn’t done when she was 
visiting and when I went to turn music on, 
I remembered fondly how much we had 
obsessed over One Direction growing up. 
Unknowingly, the weekend with her had 
been one of my favorites of all my time in 
college.
I now recognize that no matter where 
I live in the world my sister will be my 
home base — the person I know to regu-
larly check in with. I might have more in 
common with my friends, but they aren’t 
my roots. My sister is.
I believe that my sister, the straight 
edge girl who’s always certain there’s a 
right and wrong answer, was brought into 
this world the way she is so we could bal-
ance each other out. She shines brightly 
through her strengths and softens the 
blow of my weaknesses. My expectation 
of having a sister who would be exactly 
what I wanted her to be was never fair. 
She needed to contrast me because two of 
the same puzzle pieces don’t fit just right. 
Our differences truly complement each 
other. And honestly, two of me sounds 
absolutely exhausting and dangerous.
Maybe one day we’ll be those insepa-
rable and adorable sisters. Or maybe we’ll 
flourish and go our own ways. But no mat-
ter what, I know that she’ll always be there 
for me, and I will always be there for her. 
I feel for both the pains and successes she 
will experience in life. I hope she knows 
how much she has to look forward to, and 
how excited I am for her. I wonder how 
she will change throughout her college 
years and beyond. All of these sentiments 
I have whirling through my head. Mean-
while, we still remain fairly distant, living 
out our own separate lives while silently 
understanding that even if we don’t speak 
every day, and no matter how different we 
are, we will always be there when we need 
each other the most. Ultimately, it’s this 
unspoken trust that defines sisterhood.

fter classes were canceled in January 
this semester, I wondered just how 
extreme weather conditions must 
be in order for an extreme decision like this 
to be made by the University. Though there 
is no official record of school closings, The 
Daily archives show the University has only 
canceled classes for extreme weather five 
times for a total span of seven days since it 
was founded in 1817.
The first time the University closed was 
during the winter of 1945, and though no 
specific date could be found, we know it was 
only for one day. The second closing on Dec. 

2, 1974, was caused by extreme snowfall 
from the previous day. The third happened 
Jan. 27 and 28, 1978, and it was the first time 
the University canceled classes for more 
than one day.
Between 1978 and 2014, the University 
changed its definition for canceling classes 
due to weather from “Closure for Weather” 
to “Reduction of Operations for Weather.” 
The reason for this change seems to be that 
the closure of some University facilities, 
such as dorms and dining halls, would leave 
students stranded in a time of extreme 
weather. 
Therefore, 
some 
University 

operations such as classes and academic 
buildings would be shut down for extreme 
weather, but not integral operations relating 
to students’ safety and well-being on 
campus like operations providing access to 
University grounds and communications. 
This change was first exhibited on Jan. 
28, 2014, when the University reduced 
operations by canceling classes, making this 
the first cancellation due to weather in 36 
years.
Most recently, on Jan. 30 and 31, 2019, the 
University reduced operations by canceling 
classes for two days.

This research, and the cancellations that 
occurred this semester, prompted me to 
collect weather data for the four winters 
where the University canceled class from 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration. I wanted to know why 
these cancellations were so few and far 
between.
This scatterplot shows the most extreme 
weather days from 1960 to 2019, and displays 
where the exact days of school closures have 
fallen over this time.
In order to contextualize the conditions 
of each individual winter, I created this 
graph, which shows temperatures and snow 
depth for each of the four winters during 
which the University canceled classes, with 
the red line indicating when the University 
canceled classes.
The data shows that the reduced 
operations on Jan. 28, 2014 and Jan. 30 
and 31, 2019, happened due to extreme cold 
weather, with extreme low temperatures 
falling to minus 11 degrees Fahrenheit 
during 2014, and minus 18 degrees 
Fahrenheit during 2019. The closures on 
Dec. 2, 1974 and Jan. 26 and 27, 1978 were 
due to extreme snow accumulation.
Overall, according to NOAA data from 
weather stations in the Ann Arbor area, 
there have only been 25 days since 1960 
where minimum temperatures reached 
below minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit. In 
that same time, there have been seven days 
where the daily snowfall was greater than 
10 inches.
After evaluating winter weather data 
in conjunction with University closures, it 
is still unclear how the University makes 
such monumental decisions to reduce 
its operations due to extreme weather. 
This decision-making process will have 
to continue to evolve with our changing 
climate and technology, as is reflected in 
this weather data analysis.

The young rapper: 
rapping to sucess

Y

o, wassup folks!!! It’s $KingJ$ (rapper name) and I’m 
gonna write about how and why I started rapping.
Back in 7th grade, I met a new teacher. The class-
room was filled with 31 students, and I wasn’t familiar with 
any of them except for two friends. I was anxious about not 
knowing anyone, so I kept away from most conversations. 
However, the teacher was nice and supportive about students’ 
writing, and she made us do easy homework.
During third quarter, the entire class had to do a presenta-
tion about huge events that happened around the world. There 
were a few options to present. One that I chose was rap lyrics 
because it was one of the easiest to do. Since I was nervous and 
thought people would judge me, the teacher let me present it to 
her privately after school. The topic of my rap was Hurricane 
Katrina. Talking about something sad and serious made me 
feel like I was showing empathy. She told me the lyrics were 
good and gave me a C or a B, but I don’t remember exactly 
what grade I got. This kinda motivated me to do more lyrics 
like this.
In the summer, I made some more rap lyrics and posted 
some of them on Instagram. I got a couple more likes than I 
expected. I also showed my online friends and they said, “Yo 
that’s fire bruh.” I started listening to other artists such as Lil 
Skies, Logic, Juice WRLD, XXXTentacion, Tekashi69 and 
Marshmello, and they motivated me to be more positive, so I 
started writing lyrics with positivity. I grew up being Catholic 
and knowing God would protect me from the bad things that 
could happen in my life or to the people I love. These rappers 
and my religion inspired me to make better lyrics.
I also rap in Spanish because I’m learning it, and if I try to 
make lyrics in Spanish I’ll learn it faster. My parents are Mex-
ican and always speak Spanish to me. I talk to them in Eng-
lish, but if I talk in Spanish, they’ll be proud of me. After a trip 
from Canada, they bought a CD filled with songs that were in 
Spanish, and I thought it was cool when they had rap mixed 
with Spanish lyrics. It had a happy-mood type beat and the 
song was in fluent Spanish. The song was talking about forget-
ting the people who hate you, and starting to live life the way 
you want to. This was the first song I heard from the rapper 
Farruko. From this moment, I started including Spanish lyr-
ics in some of my other songs.
The way I make my lyrics is by giving myself more energy. 
This one time, I was in a boxing class and I was thinking of 
some topics to rap about. Instead, I started thinking of some 
lyrics, and it was like freestyling in my mind. I then realized 
that if I have adrenaline flowing faster, I have more energy to 
think of words and rhymes. I memorized the lines and went 

back home and started writing them. The song was called 
“Manifesto” and it was about some of the things I do to make 
the bad things go away.
The next one I wrote was inspired by the song by Roddy 
Ricch and Marshmello called “Project Dreams.” One of the 
lines I heard was “got 25 thousand on me” I think. I started 
thinking about how I would get more money if I worked hard-
er. Sometimes, I would work so hard that I would need a break, 
and I took breaks by trying something new or doing a hobby. 
One of those times was when I was in my room on a Thursday 
night, studying for a test for history that I was anxious about. 
I would be worried about studying all the information or get-
ting a bad grade on the test. I would go take a break in the liv-
ing room, hang out with the family, or take a walk outside and 
feel the fresh air. Here are the lyrics:

These were two of my song lyrics that express my feelings in 
a way. I like rapping because it’s basically poetry and poetry 
rhymes.
Put a beat over it, and there’s straight bars.

few days ago, when I woke up, I went to the kitchen and my mom was there with the radio playing “The Middle.” 
I took a peek through the gate, and there I saw my dog Sully. Sully is small and has light fur, big eyes and a cute 
little nose. She also does not like getting flipped on her belly.
I saw her dancing. She was shaking her head and tail 
up, down, right and left. Then, I went to the kitchen and 
turned off the radio. Then she saw me and stared at me. 
When she was staring at me, I felt like she was a little ner-
vous because I was watching her. I also felt like she was 
mad because she kept on staring at me for a long time. I like 
to dance, too, but not in front of people.
I opened the gate. Then, I picked up her blue ball and 
threw it. She went to get it, and when she came to me, I put 
my hand in front of her. She dropped the ball in my hand. 
After this happened, I took a nap and I dreamed about 
Sully’s talent and that she would be a good avi dog. She 
could be an avi dog that lives in the mountains and protects 
people from avalanches.

O

ne day, when I was at school, my teacher 
handed me a Scholastic News because we 
were picking partners and doing our work 
with each other. I choose my best friend, Jasmine. 
When we opened the Scholastic News to the first page, 
we saw some facts about George Washington. We both 
read one, and I read that George Washington did not 
actually want to be president. He did it anyway, even 
though he did not want to. The next fact that Jasmine 
read was that he got really sick a lot. He had lots of dis-
eases so that is how he died.

I

t was the day of Halloween, and my teacher told me 
and my class that we could dress up as what we would 
be wearing on Halloween. After school, I put on my 
costume and went out trick or treating. Outside, it was 
very dark and the houses were spooky. Lots of people were 
dressed up in different costumes. I saw a man in a creepy 
clown costume. He was wearing a hat on his head that was 
all black, a red suit, and googly eyes on his glasses like a 
creepy mad scientist clown. I was on the sidewalk, and there 
were fog machines so I couldn’t see anything. It made me 
feel like someone was coming after me. I like Halloween 
because I like getting the chance to dress up.

Thinking about green 
technology from my 
school bus
BY OGI VASSILEV
D

ear Humanoid Beings of The Universe,

Okay, before I start, I want you to think — should 
we make green technology to prepare for a world with no oil, 
or make green technology after there is no oil? On March 11, 
2019, I was reading an article about green energy technology 
and how we could transform the world into a much healthier 
one for my generation. Lately, I have been looking out from the 
window of my school bus at the world outside and seeing that 
our cars, trucks and other vehicles are making our happy blue 
world into a depressingly dark one. It scares me to think that I 
could encounter really bad catastrophes, live with unhealthy 
animals, or have to breathe through a gas mask, knowing that 
the past generation did this to me and future generations.
I don’t believe it’s too late to change the vision of a depress-
ing dark world into a blue one. We could create new materials 
that are soft and cheap, but still really strong. We could create 
new plants, and maybe even new creatures! I know, it sounds 
like something that is too far into the future, but we’re so far 
with using technology that, when you think about, it’s not an 
impossible dream.
I’m that typical fantasy nerd who’s always sitting in the 
corner thinking about new fantasy things. 
Some things that I’ve thought of are 
exoskeletons for people who maybe 
don’t have certain limbs, robots that 
could work similar to the Hulkbuster 
from Infinity War and other weird sci-
ence fiction things. 
Anyway, as 
I was saying, we 
could use 
the sun’s ener-
gy to power the 
sonic thrust-
ers in rockets 
and 
propel 
them to new gal-
axies, or 
even new parallel worlds. Worlds that 
have never had a single war. Worlds 
where there is always peace and dino-
saurs were never extinct.
Like the Swedish 16-year-old Greta 
Thunberg, a climate change 
activist who inspired me to 

stand up for the environment, I will hopefully live on this 
planet for 85 years. It will be my parents and elders who will 
decide how my generation will live in the future. Finding out 
about Greta was a great moment because she motivated me to 
fully open my jar of thoughts. The first time I saw Greta was 
on screen while watching CNN 10 in school, and I felt like 
that typical superhero who discovered their superpower. I felt 
this way because I knew I wasn’t the only one with a desire to 
want to skip school and go in front of the White House to yell, 
“BUILD GREEN TECHNOLOGY NOW!”
Anyway back on track, let’s talk green technology — you 
know that cheesy Sprint Wi-Fi ad with the giant robot tell-
ing you only the good things about Sprint? I’m not doing that. 
What I am doing is telling both bad and good things about 
green technology. So, some bad things about green technol-
ogy is that it is too expensive. It uses so much money that 
maybe taxes will be raised and famine may start to occur 
in unexpected places, and that might cause some problems 
with the government. Also, the thing that most bugs me about 
renewable technology is the question of it just shutting down. 
What if all the technology shutdown and we stopped having 
energy? We would have no fridge, no stove, and most of all, the 
car you drive to get that amazing bag of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos 
you wanted to get would not work.
Green technology is good…and bad, but hey, what’s to 
lose when we are running out of oil? This means I won’t 
have gas to cook that secret recipe my mom’s been telling 
me about. You know, lets come back to the question in the 
begin-
ning: Should we make green technology 
and prepare before there is no oil, or 
make green technology after there is 
no oil? In the meantime, let’s think 
about how we’re going to save the 
future generations from the biggest 
villains 
like famine, disease, loss of respect, global 
warming, polarization and most of people’s ignorance to 
this fatal problem that might conclude the human race. 
So before you finish reading this article and start play-
ing on the Doodle Jump app, just think that one simple 
change in the industry world could change the world. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sincerely, 
The Future Generation

ecently, during my 2 a.m. post-
library attempt to fall asleep, 
I was scrolling through Twit-
ter and fell upon a video by The Atlantic 
titled “Bulgaria: The World’s Fastest-
Shrinking Country.” I clicked, intrigued. 
As the child of two Bulgarian immigrants, 
I am bilingual and culturally tuned to my 
ethnic background. But because I was 
born and raised in the United States, I am 
always curious to learn and understand 
more about Bulgaria. 
While I gossip in Bulgarian with my 
grandmother over обяд (lunch), cook 
леща (lentils) in my messy college 
house kitchen and scour Spotify for any 
new album releases by Bulgarian show-
man and musician Slavi Trifonov, I also 
feel misplaced whenever I return to visit 
family in Sofia. I sense this divide, daily: 
In my core, I am an American girl, but I 
am also different because of the different 
rituals I have practiced for my whole life.
That’s why, after 20 minutes of watch-
ing The Atlantic’s reportage on Altimir, 
a rural Bulgarian village, I was both irri-
tated and confused. The title of the piece 
implied that it would explore the rising 
rates of emigration from Bulgaria as a 
whole, and the description noted that 
“that the story of globalization is often 
told from the perspective of those who 
leave” and boasted it would show what life 
was like for those who remained. Yet the 
entire 17-minute piece focused on one vil-
lage, one man and one generalized story.
The coverage was no more than a sim-
plified, one-dimensional pity piece made 
for cinematographic effect rather than 
accurate, important journalism. It lacked 
narration as it made sweeping dramatic 
shots over dilapidated buildings and fac-
tories. It faulted any historical context 
as it paused on old Soviet billboards. It 
showed clips of the elders reminiscing on 
Communism without describing exactly 
how such political ideology functioned.
It made no effort to explain the pro-
found issues in the country while follow-
ing an old man, Yordan, as he biked about 
the town, with camera shots that seemed 
to focus more on aesthetic angles than 
substantive interviews and dialogue. And 
judging by the title of their documentary, 
the piece unfairly synthesized every dif-
ferent Bulgarian region, dialect, culture 
and community into one rural town, into 
one story. How could this be representa-
tive of an entire country?
This form of reporting is nothing new, 
though. From films to newspapers to 
literature, Western publications love 
to romanticize countries they deem as 
lesser and pitiful. For example, in what 
is supposed to be an informative video, a 
travel channel’s YouTube pegs Bulgaria 

as a good destination for “tripsters” to go 
to when in search of the “bleakest, most 
obscure regions of the planet.”
It seems to me that the Western media 
maintains a certain allure for the for-
merly oppressed, for places where people 
had to adapt in the most curious of ways 
to survive. In the famous book Franco-
Czech author Milan Kundera, “The 
Unbearable Lightness of Being,” the nar-
rator muses on how Western Europeans 
find the “spirit dissidents show during 
repression and revolution” attractive. 
The Swiss character Franz regards the 
regime and rebellion in Czechoslovakia 
with admiration and jealousy, deeming 
the drama a representation of “real life” 
— one that he yearns to experience. This 
ultimately makes his Slovakian lover, 
Sabina, hate him — she cannot believe he 
views oppression as anything other than 
ugly and traumatic.
The reality of oppression and revo-
lution is not as pretty as Franz or The 
Atlantic tries to make it out to be. My 
parents often reminisce on their lives in 
the Eastern Bloc with creased eyes and 
furrowed brows, musing on the limits of 
opportunity under the suffocating regime 
with both disdain and nostalgia. Their 
feelings toward their home country are 
conflicted, but are theirs to make.
My mother sees no romance in my 
grandmother’s cancer, an illness my 
mother believes was partially brought 
on by the constant state of anxiety and 
oppression the regime produced. My 
father does not tell of beauty when he 
reflects on empty grocery stores and how 
he smuggled CDs through the airport to 
give to friends.
But they do see hope in the birth of a new 
generation. They do encourage my desire 
to live in Sofia and cheer on the activists 
we read about on local news sites. That’s 
why they bring me back almost every 
year: to see joy in the rising sun of a new 
Bulgaria, the only one I know and the one 
The Atlantic can’t seem to see.
The Bulgaria my parents left was one 
of economic and political instability fol-
lowing the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
Through the United States diversity visa 
program, they had an opportunity for a 
more promising future and took it. The 
Bulgaria I got to know came much later, 
when the country was achieving fiscal 
stability and corruption was relatively 
low. I remember spending the equivalent 
of a dime for popcorn in Sofia’s South 
Park and hiking the Vitosha mountain 
for free. I smile at the memory of picking 
figs off of trees with my grandmother and 
exploring rivers by my grandfather’s villa. 
I laugh at the time I went to Bulgaria as 
a teenager, excited by the $1 a shot deals 

at each bar lining the coast of the Black 
Sea. These are images I fail to see repre-
sented in the media, perhaps because they 
are too reminiscent of the more elite and 
expensive life on the Western side of the 
continent.
While my memories of summers in 
Bulgaria are little sunbeams on the land-
scape of my Eastern European heritage, 
they are also admittedly immature and 
slightly uninformed. The previously sta-
bilizing economy is shaky once again, and 
issues of corruptionare increasingly pres-
ent. But there is a difference between rec-
ognizing a country’s troublesome history 
and present lack of leadership and label-
ing it as a failed state. In our globalizing 
world, there is a gap between countries 
with years of independence and stabil-
ity, and those who are playing catch-up 
to reach what is accepted as a first-world 
standard of living.
My issue with reporting on former 
Communist countries is they narrow the 
diversity and trauma of the Balkan region 
into one politically convenient image: a 
cautionary tale of what happens in coun-
tries without capitalism. They present a 
stereotype of a backward place where the 
average citizen is a villager who does no 
more than bike about their deserted town 
and drink ракия (rakia, or fruit brandy) 
in a cottage with other elders.
As someone born and raised in the 
United States, I acknowledge that my 
understanding of Bulgaria and the Bal-
kan region is limited and biased. How-
ever, through this cultural duality of my 
upbringing and frequent visits to Bulgar-
ia, I have a more refined and holistic view 
on what life there actually looks like. This 
is why I stress the importance of con-
suming films, books or even music about 
Eastern Europe by Eastern Europeans. 

Not only are they artful and entertain-
ing, but they present reality in an honest 
and effective way.
Storytelling is an interesting craft, one 
of great importance in our globalizing 
world. 
As someone who wants to learn more 
about where I am from, I am frequently 
disappointed by the biased representa-
tions of Bulgaria and Eastern Europe that 
I find when searching the web. I believe 
storytellers have a responsibility to bal-
ance their portrayal of political upheaval 
and economic instability with the rawest, 
sweetest and most tragic of memories.
For me, these deep memories and con-
nections manifest in the simplest of ways. 
I have learned to understand my Bulgari-
an identity through learning how to make 
пълнени чушки (stuffed bell pepper) 
with my mom, celebrating the holiday 
Baba Marta in the springtime and playing 
soccer with all of my male relatives.
So I urge anyone, “tripster” or true 
curious traveler, to search beyond the 
Western media to create their own image 
of these less known but still culturally 
rich places. As rates of emigration rise, 
and subsequent opinions are formulated 
on why this is, I suggest informing your-
self comprehensively. There are infinite 
corners to a country — nooks where num-
bers cannot exist. There are stories that 
cannot be told through percentages and 
data. Sometimes, the sun and tradition 
are the strongest truth.

Fictional characters, real life lessons

T

hroughout my life, I have been 
called many different things — a 
loud and little extrovert as a child 
to a loud and liberal feminist throughout 
my teenage years. With my high-volumed 
voice, which I can thank my dad’s side of 
the family for — I’m mute compared to 
them — I never stopped talking. 
Teenage angst may be a cliché, but it’s 
one that I embraced to the fullest — I was 
the middle-schooler who was infuriated 
by everything around her. Cliques were 
forming, girls were turning on each other, 
boys channeled their immaturity into mis-
treatment. I was making my way through 
the awkward stage with a tunnel-sized gap 
between my teeth, glasses that didn’t quite 
fit my face and extremely sensitive levels of 
confidence. My friends were ever-chang-
ing, with useless drama constantly pitting 
people against one another. With this con-
stant lack of stability, I struggled to find 
my identity. Every emotion was confused 
with endless anxiety, a feeling so great that 
it often trumped my ability to adequately 
express myself. Words failed me — noth-
ing I said had the power strong enough to 
convey what I meant and what I felt. It was 
all too overbearing. I needed to find a way 
around it.
I had one guaranteed spot of refuge from 
the war zone of adolescence: books.
The advice of fictional characters is 
often overlooked. As people grow up, they 

gravitate toward the idea that made-up 
stories and characters are childish, and 
instead of reaching for a fantasy novel 
about a dystopian society, adults are 
expected to read works like eloquent dis-
sertations of the history of yarn. I’m not 
saying non-fiction books aren’t important 
— because of course they are — however, 
it’s essential that people do not dismiss the 
power of fiction.
Fictitious characters living in fictitious 
towns going to fictitious schools expe-
riencing fictitious problems that to me, 
somehow felt real. Problems that weren’t 
my own, being solved by people who I 
aspired to be. Made-up scenarios con-
structed by an author to emanate univer-
sal truths. 
I needed these fake realities.
I read books like “Looking for Alaska,” 
a John Green mystery novel with an enig-
matic female character, or “Nineteen 
Minutes,” a multi-perspective account of 
a school shooting by Jodi Picoult. Novels 
that had characters with traits that went 
below surface level, offering complex, lay-
ered personalities that I thought I couldn’t 
find in the people around me. Novels with 
female protagonists who weren’t afraid to 
unapologetically be themselves and male 
protagonists who not only respected this 
factor, but admired it as well. Novels that 
broke the boundaries of the toxic mascu-
linity that most middle school boys were 

victims of. Novels that praised the bold 
and the different. And with these novels, I 
found a way to both quiet myself down, yet 
finally open myself up.
In these imaginary worlds, I was no lon-
ger the girl who couldn’t stop talking — the 
content of the novels spoke to me. Instead 
of accidentally interrupting the authors 
mid-sentence, I listened to each tale as if 
they were commandments sent from God. 
I dog-eared pages I thought were insight-
ful and highlighted lines I thought were 
important. Each memorable quote became 
personal advice I could always come back 
to when I needed it. Because my teen angst 
pushed me to neglect the middle school 
guidance counselor I actually had, books 
took over the role.
One of the first books I found myself 
devoted to was centered on a girl who was 
dying. Despite its inherently morbid con-
tent, the story spoke to me. “The Fault in 
Our Stars,” another John Green novel, 
which, at the time, was not yet an inter-
national teen favorite, summoned my 
complete attention. Though it may sound 
hyperbolic, the infatuation I had with 
Augustus, Hazel and Isaac was unpar-
alleled to anything I’d read before. My 
emotional investment was so pow-
erful that my everyday routine took a 
backseat to the book. On a specific week-
day, with just 150 pages left of the novel, I 
decided I couldn’t read in school anymore. 

I went to the nurse, pretended to have a 
migraine and cried my eyes out because “I 
needed to go home.” An hour later, I was in 
my bed, worshipping the plot page by page.
Until the end.
My world came crashing down at the 
conclusion of this “heartwarming” story 
of teenage romance. I apologize for any 
spoilers, but Augustus’ death felt like a 
crime against humanity to me — an end-
ing created just to cause me pain. I cried 
to the point where I actually got sick — my 
sensitivity levels permanently affected, 
my feelings no longer held within. The 
novel gave me a sense of validation regard-
ing my whirlwind of emotions in the life 
events that surrounded me. In my world 
of teenage angst, any sign of sensitivity in 
response to catty drama was deemed and 
exposed as a weakness. A lack of confi-
dence was noticed and taken advantage 
of. On the contrary, empathy and under-
standing was discouraged. “The Fault in 
Our Stars” sparked a level of emotional 
depth that allowed me to see that these 
norms were not only immature but toxic. I 
was shown that feeling deeply for yourself 
and others is not a weakness, but instead 
a beautiful part of the human experience. 
This takeaway carries a legacy that I still 
find important today,
This particular story further supported 
my view of reading as a cheaper form of 
therapy, and encouraged me to seek out 
books as a way to find peace. I catch myself 
inserting my personality into the plots 
of books, most recently by becoming an 
onlooker in the Mitch Albom novel “The 
Magic Strings of Frankie Presto.” Read 
in a span of two days while on vacation, I 
alienated myself from the rest of the world 
in the process. Despite it being afamily 
vacation to Mexico, I certainly wasn’t in 
Mexico, but instead comfortably trapped 
inside Albom’s creation. Whatever prob-
lems plagued me at the time were irrel-
evant when I was reading.
The countless escapes provided by the 
books of my past have shaped me into the 
person I am today. Some of the adjectives 
people attribute to me may be accurate — I 
may be loud, and yes, I may be liberal, and, 
of course, I’m a feminist — but because of 
books, I’m so much more than that.
I’m 
strong-willed 
like 
Hermione 
(“Harry Potter”), brave like Tris (“Diver-
gent”) witty like Hazel (“The Fault in Our 
Stars”). Just like Alaska (“Looking for 
Alaska”), I act as if I am a hurricane, as 
impactful and bold as I feel I could be. I am 
a combination of each significant literary 
character that has deeply changed my life.
I am the books I love.

FROM BRIGHT, MULTICOLORED “ROCKS” STRATEGICALLY PLACED ON THE WALLS TO PUFFS OF 

WHITE CHALK LINGERING IN THE AIR TO CLIMBERS DANGLING FIFTY FEET IN THE AIR, THERE 

WAS NO SHORTAGE OF VISUALLY INTERESTING THINGS TO PHOTOGRAPH AT PLANET ROCK 

IN ANN ARBOR. ACCOMPANIED BY TWO EXPERIENCED CLIMBERS, I WAS ABLE TO SHOOT AS 

THEY TACKLED BOULDERING PROBLEMS AND TOP-ROPING ROUTES. EVENTUALLY, I TOOK A 

BREAK FROM SHOOTING TO GET MY BELAY CERTIFICATION SO I COULD TRY OUT THE TOP-ROPE 

ROUTES MYSELF. NEXT TIME I MAKE IT TO PLANET ROCK, I’M PLANNING TO EXPERIMENT WITH 

DIFFERENT ANGLES AND PERSPECTIVES 
— MAYBE EVEN CLIMBING AHEAD TO TAKE PHOTOS AS 

THE CLIMBERS SCALE THEIR PROJECTS.
