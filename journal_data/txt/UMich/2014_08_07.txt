The Michigan football team's
Oct. 11 game against Penn State
won't be the only football played
under the lights at Michigan Sta-
dium this year.
Head coach NOTEBOOK
Brady Hoke
announced Wednesday that the
Wolverines will also hold a scrim-
mage Aug. 16 at the Big House, open
to the public.
Hoke hopes that playing at
Michigan Stadium and at 8 p.m.
will get his team into a game-ready
mindset and prepare them for night
games this year, including Penn
State, at Notre Dame on Sept. 6 and
at Rutgers on Oct. 4.
The fact that the public will be
able to experience the scrimmage
for free also

ing in practice. ACL tears last year
against Minnesota, Indiana and
Central Michigan, respectively,
ended their seasons prematurely.
Hoke said sophomore tight end
Jake Butt is progressing well after
an ACL tear in the spring. The only
recent injury is sophomore defen-
sive back Delano Hill, who broke
his jaw in a collision in practice this
week.
Michigan hopes to have him
back for the season opener against
Appalachian State on Aug. 30, but
it's too soon to tell whether Hill
could return. He's doing alternate
conditioning, including running
and weight lifting, but is not par-
ticipating in contact drills.
"We're just not going to put him
in there where he's got a chance of
having a contact or collision," Hoke
said.

Countess healthy
after May surgery,
will wear No. 2
By JAKE LOURIM
ManagingSports Editor
Junior Devin Funchess has
always been near the top of the
depth chart, and he has always
been a target, whether at tight
end or wide receiver.
This year, something is differ-
ent: He's finally one of the more
experienced NOTEBOOK
players, too.
With wide
receiver Jeremy Gallon drafted
into the NFL, Funchess - now
officially a wide receiver after
coming into the program as a
tight end - fills Gallon's role as
a top receiver and go-to target
for fifth-year senior quarterback
Devin Gardner.
So Funchess will be counted
on to provide more than just
leadership, but he's taking the
responsibility of being a second-
year starter seriously.
"I came in, and we only had
Mike Kwiatkowski and Brandon
Moore," Funchess said. "They
got hurt, so I looked to one per-
son. Now you have Jehu and me
and (fifth-year senior) Anthony

Capatina to look to in our room.
I just embrace it. I just want to
help people be the best they can
be on the field."
For the soft-spoken Funchess,
that includes leading by example
on the field with his work ethic,
which he said has improved since
last season. But it also includes
mentoring some of the young
receivers on the team, including
incoming freshmen Drake Har-
ris and Freddy Canteen.
"Coming into college, every-
thing is brand new," Funchess
said. "They ask questions and
questions and questions like a
kid in a candy store. I just try to
answer all the questions I can as
best as possible."
Funchess will have to fig-
ure out the answers to his own
questions as he learns the new
offense put in place by first-
year offensive coordinator Doug
Nussmeier.
"My football IQ is off the
charts," Funchess said. "I knew
all the positions, made sure I
knew all the formations and just
got everybody set when we were
doing summer 7-on-7s."
COUNTESS HEALTHY
AGAIN: Redshirt junior Blake
Countess has the hype. He has
been mentioned on two award
watch lists this summer - the
Bronco Nagurski Trophy and the

Jim Thorpe Award - and was
selected to wear the famous No.
2 jersey this fall.
Now, he says he has the health
he'll need to back it up.
Countess, who missed the final
12 games of the 2012 season with
a torn ACL, had surgery in late
May to repair an abdominal inju-
ry that bothered him throughout
last season. The abdominal pain
limited his mobility, and though
he never missed a start, he men-
tioned it to coaches and trainers
as the year went on.
"I played all last year banged
up a little bit," he said. "I recov-
ered fine, and I'm going into
camp at 100 percent."
Still, Countess was realistic
about his improvement heading
into this season.
"I don't know if I feel super-
human, but I definitely feel bet-
ter," he said with a smile. "I feel
healthy. Going into camp, I feel
just where I felt last year."
That could mean a big season
for a player who was recently
given the former jersey num-
ber of Heisman winner Charles
Woodson. He always wanted to
wear the jersey after growing
up admiring players like Wood-
son and Deion Sanders, and after
conversations with head coach
Brady Hoke, he will be given the
honor this season.

The Michigan Athletic Depart-

they did, in full force. They sport-

Even before Ronaldo unex-

between Real Madrid and Man-

roaring success.

Crowded primary
field features four city
council candidates
By EMMA KERR and
SHOHAM GEVA
Daily News Editor and
ManagingNews Editor
Amid a crowded field in the Ann
Arbor Democratic mayoral pri-
mary, city council member Chris-
topher Taylor has won the position,
carrying 7,070 of 16,591 votes cast

for a total of 47.57 percent. He will
face Bryan Kelly, an independent
challenger, in the race for city
mayor Nov. 4.
"This has been truly incredible,"
Taylor, who declared success at
about 10 p.m Tuesday night, said
in a victory speech. "Politics is in
many varyingwaysaveryhumbling
thing to get involved in. I am so
delighted that, this night, the form
of humbling that I am receiving is
one of confidence and trust. For all
of you here and the voters of Ann
Arbor, I want to thank you. This is
incredibly meaningful and I will

never forget it."
Fellow Councilmembers Stephen
Kunselman (D - Ward 3), Sabra
Briere (D- Ward 1) and Sally Hart
Petersen (D-Ward 2) also ran in the
Democratic primary. Total voter
turnout was atl16.67 percent.
In an interview Tuesday night,
Taylor said he sees multiple priori-
ties to address for the city.
"The city's needs are multivari-
able, and our charge is to find the
right balance amongthem," he said.
"There are big projects that we
have: transportation, storm water

ute, Ronaldo came onto the pitch
and solidified a once-in-a-lifetime
experience for all who came to see
it.
Ann Arbor had the look and feel
of a football Saturday, only instead
of a sea of maize taking over the
town, it was swarms of red and
white.
Perhaps the biggest difference
in atmosphere from a Michigan
football game to Saturday's match
was the diversity of the people
inside the stadium. Everyone
wanted to be a part of history -
and they were, as the game drew
the largest crowd in U.S. soccer
history at.109,318 - but they each
descended on Ann Arbor by dif-
ferent means and with their own
story to tell.
As far as summer internships
go, Matty Berman effectively hit
the jackpot.
A rising senior communications
major at Marist College in Pough-
keepsie, New York, Berman was
chosen as an intern with Relevent
Sports, the company organizing
the International Champions Cup.

infrastructure, the roads and the
like."
In an interview last week, he
said, if elected, he plans to con-
tinue creating new transportation
options, including encouraging ser-
vices like Uber and Bike Share to
spread in Ann Arbor, and to support
the expansion of the AAATA public
transit system.
Taylor also supports calculated,
balanced development, as long as
it does not affect the surrounding
neighborhoods, promising to alter
zoning ordinances to avoid situa-
tions like that at 413 E. Huron St.,
where residents took issue with
the construction of a new high-rise
complex. He also plans to make
infrastructure improvements, spe-
cifically addressing the commu-
nity's need for better streets and
more enforcement of parking laws
throughout the city.
In an interview Tuesday night,
outgoing mayor John Hieftje, who
was in attendance atcTaylor's watch
party, said he was happy to pass on
the position to Taylor. Hieftje has
served at his current position for 14
years.
"There were some good candi-
dates in the race, but Chris Taylor
won and I am sure the city will be in
good hands with him," Hieftje said.
"I have no regrets - everything I
ever wanted to do is done and so

I'm happy to leave it off to others to
take over."
Among the candidates, Taylor's
voting history has been the most
similar to Hieftje's. Each candi-
date's voting record, especially
in relation to Hieftje's policies,
became a closely discussed theme
throughout the campaign.
In relationto the University, Tay-
lor, like most city officials, is con-
cerned about the potential decline
of Ann Arbor's tax base following
University acquisitions of city land,
which takes them off the tax rolls.
He has advocated for requiring the
University to pay for city expenses
generated by events at Michigan
Stadium, which could include the
costofclosingstreets and increased
police security.
In the past, Taylor has also advo-
cated for heightened coordination
with AAPD in relation to party
control and vandalism, supported
and made improvements to the
pedestrian crosswalk ordinance
and advocated for the removal of
hornets nests from parks.
Donations for Taylor's campaign
totaled $75,698, significantly more
than his fellow candidates.
Among the other candidates,
Petersen remains on City Council
until the end of her term in Novem-
ber. Because of her run for mayor,
she was ineligible to run for reelec-
tion. Both Kunselman and Briere
have an additional year left in their
City Council terms.

UMEC begins to
revamp constitution

Engineering
Council addresses
pattern of election
discrepency
By MICHAEL SPAETH
Daily StaffReporter
Inthe wake of a Central Student
Judiciary ruling in March that
invalidated the results of the Engi-
neering Council's December elec-
tion, UMEC has commenced work
on a new constitution and bylaws.
Engineering senior Kelsey
Hockstad and Engineering
graduate student Kyle Lady sued
UMEC in early March for improp-
erly conducting its December
Executive Board election and
violating their rights of equal pro-
tection and democratic represen-
tation. Among other violations of
UMEC's constitution and bylaws,
the students that became presi-
dent, vice president and director
of administration - all positions
on the Executive Board - never
ran for the position they were set
to serve in.
Additionally, the petitioners
argued that UMEC's constitution
and bylaws were in violation of
the Central Student Government
All-Campus Constitution because
UMEC claims to represent gradu-
ate students even though it cannot
collect dues from them. UMEC
does collect dues from College of
Engineering students.
In their March ruling, CSJ
ordered the UMEC Executive
Board members to resign their
positions to be replaced by inter-
im board members until the next
March election. CSJ also ruled
that while UMEC's constitution
and bylaws were not in violation
of the All-Campus Constitution
because graduate students are still
covered by the College of Engi-
neering, UMEC can limit graduate
students' participation because
they pay dues to Rackham rather
than the College of Engineering.
Engineering senior Max
Olender, UMEC President, said
the CSJ case brought greater
attention to the problems with
UMEC's constitution and bylaws
and emphasized the need for fur-
ther reform.

"Even though CSJ ruled that
neither UMEC constitution nor
bylaws were in violation of the
Central Student Government All-
Campus Constitution, it revealed
a lot of issues that had to be
addressed, and it was really sort
of eye-opening for those of us who
at the time weren't involved in
UMEC," Olender said.
In April, the UMEC General
Council passed a resolution cre-
ating a constitutional convention
to write a new constitution and
bylaws. In early May, Olender
began reaching out to engineering
departments and student organi-
zations to recruit delegates. By the
end of June, convention leader-
ship positions had been finalized
and informal online discussions
about the content of the new con-
stitution and bylaws began in early
July. The group is set to begin
forming an outline and rough
draft over the next few weeks.
While the delegates are still
in the brainstorming stage of the
process and have not met in per-
son as a full group yet, there are
several issues that are already
being discussed.
One of the most important
issues is student representation.
Many of the General Council rep-
resentatives are members of engi-
neering student organizations. At
least one member of each of these
organizations must attend Gener-
al Council meetings if the organi-
zation wants to receive funds from
UMEC.
Engineering senior David Her-
shey, chair of the constitutional
convention, said this has led to
general disinterest among General
Council representatives and has
made it difficult to get people to
care about UMEC's work.
"We're looking at things like
moving to a Senate model or an
elected model so that the people
that sign up to be on a legislative
body are people that want to be in
student government and care and
are passionate about it and can
make a difference," Hershey said.
Additionally, convention lead-
ers believe that the current 10-per-
son Executive Board is too large
and should be reduced in size.

'The other football'
thrives in Ann
Arbor, brings hype
to M' soccer
By JAKE LOURIM
ManagingSportsEditor
At exactly 3 p.m. - an hour
before kickoff of the most-attend-
ed U.S. soccer game in history at
Michigan Stadium - men's soccer
coach Chaka Daley starts walking.
He's at a tailgate with his family
and friends in the parking lot out-
side Crisler Center, on the biggest
soccer day in the history of this
campus.
This is the kind of day soccer
loyalists love: more than 100,000
fans packed inside the Big House
to watch a sport that is often over-
looked in favor of football or bas-
ketball, especially on this campus.
"This is exciting, certainly for
soccer in this country and 'the
other football,' as they say," Daley
said. "We're really excited about
what this can do for not only the
state of Michigan but certainly the
University."
Daley leaves his tailgate to head
inside the stadium, and not 30 sec-
onds pass before he's stopped by a
friend, a soccer coach at St. John's.
He shakes his hand, says a few
words and casually tells the coach
he should come to Ann Arbor some
time.
For Michigan soccer, this is a day
worth showing off, and Daley and
his team are happy to participate.

In planning the International
Champions Cup, the first deci-
sions were the dates and venues
and clubs. Then the clubs had to
be matched to the venues, and for
Michigan Stadium - a host that
could easily break the U.S. atten-
dance record of 101,799 - the two
biggest clubs in the world were a
top choice.
"I think it's an absolute home
run," Daley said. "To have this cal-
iber of a game in Ann Arbor right
after the World Cup, there's not
a much more high-profile match
than maybe the two most storied
clubs ever to play here at the Big
House."
A man driving by in a golf cart
asks him if he wants a ride. Daley
tells him he's goingto the west side
of the stadium, up to the regents'
suite to meet some of the people
who helped make the event hap-
pen.
He gets in the golf cart, but
before long, the cart is stopped by
hoards of fans entering the stadi-
um. The driver tells him he might
just be better off getting out and
walking.
So Daley gets out and walks
again, past fans who want to see
the sport he came to Michigan to
develop. A soccer game in the U.S.
between the two top clubs in the
world helps put Ann Arbor on the
map.
"I thought with two big teams,
it could be this massive event,"
Daley said. "It's lived up to all its
billing."
Daley hands a ticket to the scan-
ner at the gate and enters the big-

gest college-owned stadium in
America. "Welcome to Michigan
Stadium," the event-staff employ-
ees say.
Daley will watch part of the
game from an upper-level box
before heading down to his seats
to enjoy the action with his fam-
ily and some friends from the East
coast.
Meanwhile, with his team in
town for the match, some players
grilled in and enjoyed the atmo-
sphere of a campus that has never
looked quite like this. They went
to the game, and some took in the
open workout Friday.
"This game raises awareness for
soccer, and hopefully that trickles
down to us," said fifth-year senior
midfielder Tyler Arnone. "If peo-
ple enjoy themselves at this game,
maybe they look for, 'Hey, where
can I watch another soccer game?
I really enjoyed it."'
Beside the popularity, the game
will bring in some revenue for the
Michigan soccer programs. As
part of the facilities plan, the pro-
grams will be given office build-
ings by their stadium.
U-M Soccer Stadium will also
feature a brand-new field this
fall, the indication of a program
on the rise. As Daley enters the
Ross Tower to head upstairs and
meet with people, he talks about
his desire to follow the facilities
upgrade with the program's suc-
cess.
He walks up the stairs and
finally reaches the top of the stadi-
um, not minding at all the chaos on
campus. This was a spectacle, but
Daley's sport - "the other foot-
ball," as they call it - was right in
the middle of it.

Now it's official.
Michigan Stadium has
claimed another attendance
mark, setting a United States
record with an announced crowd
of 109,318 watching Manchester
United beat Real Madrid, 3-1,
in the International Champions
Cup on Saturday.

The Big

Michigan vs. Notre Dame) and
at a hockey game (104,173 in the
2010 Big Chill between the Wol-
verines and Michigan State).
Adding to Saturday's specta-
cle, reigning Ballon d'Or winner
Cristiano Ronaldo - who was
initially ruled out with a leg inju-
ry - played for the last 16 min-
utes, making his first appearance
since starring for Portugal in the
World Cup.

In the end, Manchester Unit-
ed won to advance to the tourna-
ment final, but make no mistake:
The tournament's crown jewel
was played Saturday at Michigan
Stadium.
"It was a fantastic atmo-
sphere," said Real Madrid man-
ager Carlo Ancelotti, "because
(we're) not used to playing in
front of a lot of people like today.
... We tried to do our best to give
joy to the people. The game, in
general, was a good game."
Though the United States will
host the 2016 Copa America and
could be in line for an upcoming
World Cup, the new attendance
mark will stand for the foresee-
able future unless more matches
are played at

narrow sideline, they chanted
his name in adoration.
But soon, the event staff
employees scurried with trash
bags through the bleachers, the
on-field billboards were taken
down, and Michigan Stadium
began its transformation back to
football.

' ~ lifelong sports fun, Bermun knows
he wants to work in sports and fig-
ured a summer stint with Relevent
would be a great opportunity to
break into the industry. What sur-
prised him, though, was that nearly
one quarter of his summer would
be spent traveling the country with
Real Madrid, stopping in Los Ange-
les, Dallas and Berkeley, California,
and culminating Saturday with his
first-ever trip to Michigan.
"This is something I probably
wouldn't have imagined would
have been available as a summer
internship," Berman said. "It's been
an extremely pleasant surprise."
Managing the press circus on
the field, in the tunnel and on any
excursions, Berman has gotten to
keep close quarterswith the Cham-
pions League winners, but he has
also had to adopt a security-guard
mentality.
But he has also gotten to learn
more aboutethegame alongthe way,
watching stars like Ronaldo and
Gareth Bale at practice every day,
and has gained some new favorite
players as well.
"Once I got to know some of
them closely, definitely I'll be root-

Kentucky, Tennessee
and Ohio cases also
currently underway
By SHOHAM GEVA
ManagingNews Editor
Wednesday, the 6th Circuit
Court heard oral arguments in six
pending cases from four different
states concerning the legality of
gay marriage, including one case
from Michigan.
DeBoer v. Snyder, filed in 2012,
which began as a case against
Michigan's ban on adoption by
same-sex couples and evolved into
a challenge to the state's over-
all ban on gay marriage, is one of
two cases out of the six to directly
address legalization of marriage.
The other four address general
recognition of same-sex marriag-
es performed outside of the state
and recognition for the purposes
of issuing death and birth certifi-
cates.
Jay Kaplan, ACLU Michigan's
LGBT Legal Project staff attorney,
said when it comes to the circuit
court trial, Michigan's situation
among the four other states is dis-
tinctive for several reasons.
"What's unique about Michi-
gan's decision is that unlike most
of the state federal court chal-
lenges, Michigan had a full fledged
trial with witnesses, expert wit-
nesses, and testimony, so the judge
made some findings of fact, and I
think it makes it a stronger deci-
sion," Kaplan said. "An appellate
court, they can reverse based on
findings of law, but not findings of
fact."
In opening arguments on the
DeBoer case, attorneys for the
defense, in favor of the ban, char-
acterized the case as a question of
voter's rights. Michigan's gay mar-
riage ban was instituted in 2004 as
a statewide ballot proposal.
"It is a fundamental premise of
our democratic system that the
people can be trusted to decide
even divisive issues, on rational
grounds, and that's what this case
is about," Michigan's Solicitor
General Aaron Lindstrom told the
court.

Attorneys for the defense, in
contrast, described the case as
remedying an unconstitutionally
exclusionary policy.
"We are not asking to redefine
the marital relationship," Carole
Stanyer, attorney for the plaintiffs,
told the court. "We are only ask-
ing for an end to the exclusion of
same-sex couples from the right to
marry."
It is common for courts to stay
decision at this level when an
appeal to the Supreme Court is
expected. However, similar to the
outcome of the original decision on
the case in favor of DeBoer, which
launched an almost day-long peri-
od during which multiple county
clerks across the state, including
in Ann Arbor, married about 300
same-sex couples before late in the
evening of the same day Michigan
Attorney General Bill Schuette's
(R) request for an emergency stay
on the decision was granted, some
marriages could occur as a result.
Sandi Smith, president of the
Jim Toy Community Center, a
Washtenaw County organization
which is a self-described local
resource for LGBTQ individu-
als and their allies, said locally
the district court's decision saw a
huge reaction, especially in terms
of couples waiting'to get married.
Because the 6th Circuit's deci-
sion is expected to be stayed, she
said the impact she expects from
the 6th Circuit's eventual decision
is similar to the outcome of the
March case at the district level.
"We have an opportunity for
perhaps a window where marriag-
es again can resume, and be recog-
nized and be legal in the state of
Michigan," she said.
The 300 marriages performed
after the district court decision
are currently in a legal limbo fol-
lowing the emergency stay. The
American Civil Liberties Union's
Michigan branch has sued on
behalf of the couples married in
the interim between the decision
and the emergency stay, and asked
that the state recognize the mar-
riages.

on Two vendors at EJ's Gourmet
ey Street Cuisine decided to capitalize
ng on the opportunity. They set up the
d- same street-side food stand thatthey
ht do for football games, selling hot
dogs, kielbasa and Polish sausage.
In the early afternoon Saturday,
the response was positive already.
"Last night when we were out in
the town, it was a higher-quality
crowd, so we definitely sold more
premium meat, instead of hot
dogs," one vendor said.
The two said they would keep
their stand up until shortly after
the game ended, when the crowd
started to die out.
Both enjoyed the opportunity
for extra business and said they
would be open to doing it again for
any event that Michigan holds.
"It depends on how many people
we got ready, and how prepared we
can be, and how quick we can be,"
the vendor said. "We heard about
this with a fair amount of time."

When Michigan Stadium was
first rumored as a possible venue
for the 2014 Guinness Internation-
al Champions Cup, it wasn't hard to
connect the dots.
Bigclubs at the Big House meant
big money. But beyond the potential
payout, the sheer matchup between
Real Madrid and Manchester Unit-
ed - the two most popular soccer
clubs in the world - meant big
opportunity.
The tournament and Brandon
put the best possible product in
the continent's largest stadium and
took in fans from all over: India,
Canada and, yes, even Columbus.
It created the game of a lifetime
for most of them, and who knows?
Maybe it even started a new chap-
ter of fandom for others.
Either way, this wasn't any ordi-
nary football Saturday. Not every-
one was dressed in maize, or from
the area, or even from America. But
on this day, among a wild crowd of
109,318, anyone could belong.

Education, not incarceration
Michigan prisons in desperate need of reform by state legislature
T he largest growing industry in Michigan since 1980 is
the prison industry. Twenty-four years ago, Michigan
corrections department's budget was three percent of the
state's fiscal budget. Today, the corrections department accounts for
20 percent of the budget. Similarly, Michigan prisoners serve longer
sentences and cost more to taxpayers than the national average. With
correctional facilities using more money than education, reforming
the prison system has become increasingly important to the state
legislature's bipartisan agenda. The state legislature must take
reformatory action as soon as possible so funding can be redirected
to areas in desperate need of help such as education.

Every time I go back home to Seattle, I
always look out across Lake Washington
and see construction cranes out in the
distance. Construction on the Evergreen
Point Bridge, which connects the eastside
suburbs to downtown Seattle, is well
underway. However, it has taken much
longer than expected. Not only that, the
project is $128 million over budget.
After watching the development of
the bridge, I started to think more about
transportation and its infrastructure. As
I took an Amtrak train from New York
to Washington, D.C., I noticed some
differences between American railroads
and European ones. In Europe, one can
travel from Brussels to Paris in about 1.5
hours in their high-speed trains (about
160 miles). For a comparison, it took me
about three hours to get to D.C.
So, after making this trip, I wondered
how much money would be needed
to fix America's infrastructure issues.
According to the American Society of
Civil Engineers, continuing to repair
existing equipment will cost Americans
approximately $570 billion by 2020 and
$1 trillion by2040.
The part of ASCE's transportation
report that piqued my interest the most
wasthesectionaboutAmerica'srailroads.
Rail has been one of the bright spots for
American infrastructure even duringthe
recession, as funding for railroads has
increased to $75 billion. In some states,
such as California, governments have
even tried to develop high-speed rail
projects.
However, as the ASCE indicated on
its website, changes can still be made to
further improve rail services:
"To meet future demand in the
Northeast Corridor for both Amtrak
and the eight commuter railroads that
use the corridor, estimated investments
are about $10 billion over the next 15
years to achieve a state of good repair
and to increase train capacity by 40%.
Maintaining adequate track capacity to
address expanding passenger and freight
needs is among the largest challenges in
creating a competitive passenger railroad
network."
Thisis wherehigh-speedrailcomesin.
As seen in the diagram from
Cambridge Systematics, the long-term
benefits of having high-speed rail would
be larger than one might expect. In
California for example, high-speed rail
projects would be a huge step forward,
as it would create new temporary and
permanent jobs. According to a report
released by the California Rail High
Speed Authority, the development of
high-speed rail in California could lead
to the creation of 150,000 new jobs and
maybe more. In the long-term, providing
new trains and equipment would help

to reduce fares and possibly help spur
innovation. And fewer planes in the
skies and cars in the streets means there
could be a reduction in pollution. At the
same time, there would be a reduction in
accidents.
Opponents of high-speed rail have
said that it would be very expensive
to develop the necessary technology
throughout the country - and they have
a point. According to the Los Angeles
Times, it would cost between $6.19
billion and $7.13 billion to build just one
portion of California's rail system. Unlike
Europe, the U.S. could not possibly have
high-speed rail tracks across the entire
country.
Abettersolutionwouldbetoimplement
incremental changes, since planes are a
more viable option over longer distances
interms ofthe cost to producers toupdate
existing infrastructure (i.e. Seattle to
Boston). For the time being, high-speed
rail will make sense in higher density
areas, such as Detroit to Chicago, Boston
to New York, or San Francisco to Seattle.
With any spare money they are able to
find, state and local governments would
have the necessary funds to update the
current rail system. Trainswould be able
to compete with planes in terms of cost
and efficiency for consumers.
Creating connections such as the
ones listed above would be much more
efficient, according to Tom Zoellner an
article written in the Wall Street Journal:
"At an average speed of just 68 miles
an hour, Amtrak's Acela is a lumbering
mastodon compared with true 186-mile-
an-hour high-speed rail. Yet the Acela
and other trains in the northeast corridor
still manage to capture three-quarters
of the air and rail travelers between the
nation'scapital anditsdominantfinancial
center."
Journeys such as these are exactly
where the airlines are at their most
wasteful. Whether a plane is going 50
miles or around the world, substantial
fixed costs must be paid: maintenance,
labor, bag loading, taxes, landing fees,
cleaning and, especially, fuel. Planes
typically burn most of their fuel during
takeoff and landing. Despite this
inefficiency, short-haul trips still make
up the bulk of U.S. air travel: About two-
thirds of domestic flights are less than
700 miles, and about 35% of those are
less than 350 miles. It is much harder, of
course, to build a high-speed rail system
thanto add a fewnewplanestothe fleet."
So, perhaps it's time for a change. In
the future, I hope I can hop on a high-
speed train that could take me from Ann
Arbor to Washington D.C in no time at
all.

The Citizens Alliance on
Prisons and Public Spending,
a Lansing-based non-profit,
advocates guidelines for the
state to take into consideration
during the reforms. Policies
such as, presumptive parole,
where all prisoners are released
after their minimum sentence
unless there is reason to believe
there's a risk, more discretion
for "good time" and revamping
the parole board have been
suggested by CAPPS to help
both prisoners and the state.
While violent crimes in
Michigan fell by 30 percent
from 1986 to 2006, state
prisons experienced growth
of more than 250 percent.
This increase stems from a
variety of factors that can be
altered. Our prisoners spend
4.3 years in prison compared
to the national average of
2.9 years. Imprisoning non-
violent crime offenders for
longer time proves ineffective

in ensuring safety for the
state. A 2013 study by the Pew'
Center found that Michigan's
rate of incarceration dropped
12 percent between 2007
and 2012 while crime rates
fell 17 percent during the
same time period indicating
incarceration may not be the
answer to preventing crimes.
Lightening sentences could
prove beneficial to both
taxpayers and those convicted
of minor offenses.
Partly due to the War on
Drugs established in the
1980s and the rise in felony
convictions, Michigan's prison
population is becoming older,
with some older prisoners
costing $200,000 a year -
significantly more than the
already expensive $35,000
cost per prisoner average.
As many drug policies are
outdated and unjust, releasing
elder inmates would alleviate
the burden on Michigan's

corrections system.
Correction facilities
constitute 20 percent of
Michigan's state budget,
a percentage higher than
funding for crucial programs
like higher education. With the
majority of public universities
in Michigan increasing
tuition by upwards of three
percent, redirecting funding
currently used towards the
corrections department could
subsidize increased costs
that students pay. These high
prices act as a hindrance for
students to attend college,
and this hindrance increases
the incarceration probability.
With one year of college
decreasing incarceration of
Caucasians by 10 percent
and African Americans by 37
percent, it's imperative that
we adjust our funding to help
our youth stay out of prison
instead of increasing funds to
keep them locked away.

it's not just for moms and Nicho-

Moore is a master of gorgeous sci-
ence fiction (see: "Battlestar Galac-

The cinematography is top-notch,
and the charismatic Scottish high-
lands are almost as beautiful as
Jamie Fraser himself. The music,
composed by fellow "BSG" alum
Bear McCreary is romantic and
searing, and scores every scene
perfectly. The actors, although
mostly newcomers, are well-cast
and talented. "Outlander" is well-
written, and the dialogue is never
heavy-handed. With such a fine
pedigree, it's unfair to blindly clas-
sify "Outlander" asa "chick show."
There's exciting storytelling and
great characters, which doesn't
have to be gendered.
This is only the beginning for
"Outlander," and the remainder
of its 16-episode season is sure to
bring more surprises and delight.
My only complaint about this epi-
sode was that the first two thirds
are so slow in comparison to the
ending, but it's a bold move for a
show to begin with an eye toward
quiet characterization. "Outland-

its promise in the comingweeks.

GALAXY
From Page 7
thousands of years into the future
- it's set in 2014. That little nugget
of information is planted early on
and stays with us throughout.
One superb aspect of the film is
the cast of wonderfully developed
characters, each with motives
and histories of their own. Rocket
(voice of Bradley Cooper, "Silver
Linings Playbook") is a geneti-
cally-modified raccoon bounty
hunter whose vitriolic tongue and
highly intelligent brain provide
some interesting antics. Drax the
Destroyer (Dave Bautista, "Rid-
dick") is a hulking warrior bent
on avenging his slain wife and
child. Quill dubs him a "walk-
ing Thesaurus" who is ironically
incapable of understanding figu-
rative language. Female warrior
Gamora (Zoe Saldana, "Avatar")
was orphaned as a child - some-
thing she and Quill subconsciously
bond over - and was taken up by
Thanos (Josh Brolin, "No Country
for Old Men"), a selfish titan of the
universe who reformed her into
a weapon. Michael Rooker ("The
Walking Dead") delivers a volatile
performance as Yondu, captain
of the very same spaceship that
abducted Quill as a boy.
The film's appeal is perhaps
most reflected by Groot (Vin Die-
sel, "The Fast and the Furious"),
a humanoid tree whose origin
goes unexplained. Yet, we feel as
though we've known Groot from
some other time. James Gunn
described him as "one-hundred
percent deadly, one-hundred per-
cent sweet" and that's as accurate
as any description can be of him.
Groot is, like the film itself, both
extremely powerful and extremely
nuanced. His character has but one
line: "I am Groot." Like every other
risk in the film, Gunn and company
completely pull it off.
That particular quality - stack-
ing risk on top of risk, then fulfill-
ing them all with cinematic grace
and originality - defines "Guard-
ians of the Galaxy." Between the
retro music, the maniacal charac-
ters, the genre satire, the anti-hero
story, the visual effects, the humor
and the subtle tragedy unique to
each character, Gunn has created
a film of tremendous spirit, at once
wildly entertaining and refresh-
ingly new. Though "Guardians of
the Galaxy" takes us to new places
in our universe, it remains quint-
essentially grounded in human
nature. And that is its greatest tri-
umph of all.

I felt nervous as I shuffled into
the yellow glow of the classroom.
Everything appeared as it
normally did every other Tuesday
night. Perhaps the night's still
life wouldn't be as mortifying as
expected. Yet, as I nervously laid
out my drawing pencils, I couldn't
shake the embarrassment and
anxiety swirling in my stomach.
I'm not sure what detail of the
assignment shocked me more:
drawing a nude model or the fact
I'd be doing so for three hours! I
understood the artistic value of the
human figure, but something about
drawing it still felt explicit to me.
Despite my obvious naivete, I
was startled to learn how quickly I
was able to dehumanize the naked
individual sitting in front of me. It
sounds harsh, but I quickly learned
to stop thinking of the model as
anything more than a vase or a
chair. Muscles and bone rapidly
transformed into mere lines and
angles. While it made the drawing
process easier, I felt ashamed for
reducing a living, breathing human
to a mere object.
That's exactly what society
trains us to do. We minimize. We
reduce. We extrapolate select
characteristics and use them as
ideals for the rest of humanity.
Reduction is the only lens
society looks through to view
the human body - particularly
feminine bodies.
Currently, women's bodies are
walking billboards to sell anything
from hamburgers to hot rods, but
even eye candy must be whittled
down to the right size. According
to the National Association of
Anorexia Nervosa and Associated
Disorders, "up to 24 million people
of both genders and all ages suffer
from an eating disorder" and "86
percent of students report the onset
of an eating disorder before age 20."
Society dismisses these
structures of bone, flesh and
muscle that house minds capable
of creativity and imagination. They
hold hearts capable of immense
love and compassion and are
vessels carrying magnificent souls.
Instead, the most important assets

of a woman are the sacks of fat
resting upon her chest and the flesh
encased by her jeans. Humanity is
taught to simultaneously glorify
and vilify these anatomical
structures. Women are expected to
shed pounds, their self-confidence
and concerns for their health in
order to amplify these features and
give guys something to gawk at.
However, while the world treats us
like sex objects, women are warned
to never embrace their sexuality,
for fear of appearing improper.
There's an even darker side to the
minimization of women's bodies.
According to statistics from the
World Health Organization, "more
than 125 million girls and women
alive today have been cut in the 29
countries in Africa and Middle East
where FGM is concentrated."
In Africa and the Middle East,
young girls can be subjected to a
cultural medical procedure known
as female genital mutilation, where
genital tissue is surgically removed
to help ensure they exhibit proper
pre-marital behavior and resist
"illicit sexual acts."
Even in the United States where
FGM is illegal, there's still a need
for concern. The Center for Disease
Control and Prevention reports
that "150,000-200,000 girls in
the United States are at risk" of
undergoing FGM. There's even
possibility of girls being forced
to leave the country to have the
operation illegally - known as
"vacation cutting."
There's no medical reason to
perform the procedure. Rather,
FGM dehumanizes women
and threatens their bodies by
exposing them to numerous health
problems such as "cysts, infertility,
hemorrhaging, and need for later
surgeries."
Women's bodies weren't created
to be shrunk, purged or spliced.
We aren't objects to be tweaked
or manipulated to guarantee good
behavior. Society needs to stop
placing women's health on the line
to placate the populations who
enjoy objectifying us.

Taking back our bodies

Thursday, August 7, 2014
The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com
Coming hoMe

ast summer at this time,
I felt the same way that
most incoming freshmen
probably do
now. College
was fast
approaching,
and as the
warm, orange
summer sun
set earlier andF
earlier; as the VICTORIA
loose ends of NOBLE
my summer
job wound
themselves tightly together; and
as my high school friends and I bid
goodbye, I was surrounded by the
feeling that everything was about
to change. I was excited.
My roommate and I couldn't
wait to get to campus and begin
our freshman year. As fall grew
closer, our excitement grew
until we just couldn't wait to be
at school.
My parents and I loaded up
our car with everything from
toiletries and closet organizers
to twin extra long sheets and
pictures of home to decorate the
walls - everything needed to
make our shared, cinderblock-
walled dorm room feel like home.
Except it wasn't home, and
it wouldn't feel like it for quite
some time.
My parents left, leaving
an overwhelming feeling
of insecurity. But, like most
freshmen at welcome week,
I got dressed and ready, and
headed out to a party with my
roommate. I later came home in
tears, wandering through campus
homesick and lost.
Now, that was just one night,
and homesickness is to be
expected, at least to an extent.
Some of my other welcome week
memories are among the best
I have of freshman year, and
my one bad night was nowhere
near catastrophic. But for some
students, they can be.
Combined with pressure to
make friends with new classmates
and the nerves associated with
suddenly being on their own,
often for the first time, alcohol
can pose a very real, and in
some sense heightened risk for
freshmen. Add that to the fact that
some of these kids didn't drink
in high school and it shouldn't
come as much of a surprise that
welcome week can often produce
negative experiences for our
youngest students.

I watched peers deal with
serious and damagingexperiences
in their first weeks on campus.
One got ticketed for Minor in
Possession of Alcohol. Even more
had close encounters with over-
consumption. One was injured on
thewayhomefromaparty,andone
still regrets asexual encountershe
had with a boy she hardly knew.
Instances where ambulances
are requested become warning
tales for overconsumption - and
rightfully so. But it doesn't take an
ambulance rideto stain astudent's
first week on campus, and we
should be mindful of the impact
events that seem less serious
might have on younger students.
When so many of us call up
memories of our first weeks as
Wolverines, we cast them in
shining, golden hues. In their false
light they portray an idolized time
when we traipsed around campus
with new friends. Envious of our
past selves, we remember a time
when everything - and I mean
literally everything - was new
and exciting. There's no doubt
that the first weeks of campus life
are incredible experiences. But by
neglecting to critically examine
the difficulties we faced during
that time, we consequently fail to
consider how we might improve
the experience for the next class
of students - and it certainly
needs improving.
For many incoming freshmen,
Ann Arbor hasn't yet morphed
into the home away from home
that most students eventually
come to appreciate. To them, it's
almost inevitably uncomfortable
while still enviably fresh and
exciting. Despite offering up
thousands of new souls to meet
and hundreds of restaurants,
buildings and parks to explore,
campus still lacks the comfort
and familiarity, and consequently
safety, of home.
The University has taken
some steps to help improve
the experience of incoming
freshmen duringtheir firstweeks
on campus. They've eliminated
the option to move into dorms
early, and shortened welcome
week. All of this might limit the
opportunity to party without
the constraints of schoolwork
and class. The University should
be commended for recognizing
the problem, and taking steps
to solve it. They also provide
alcohol education, and tools like
the Stay in the Blue app, to help

5

students monitor consumption
and understand how their
habits affect their bodies. While
these efforts are admirable,
they don't do enough to remedy
the lost sense of security that
can, for some, contribute to
destructive behaviors.
That's our job. As returning
students, we have the ability to
help incoming students feel safe
and comfortable on campus,
starting from day one. By
pressuring incoming students
to drink, asserting that drunken
adventures are what college is
about or failing to be a source
of support, students directly
contribute to a more hostile
environment. And that isn't the
norm at the University. In my
experience, many people did do
their absolute best to welcome
my friends and I to campus in a
positive way. If nearly everyone
approached welcome week with
supportive attitudes, and offered
themselves as sources of guidance
to younger students, Itruly believe
we could profoundly improve the
new student experience.
Eventually, college will
start to feel like home for new
students. But for that to happen,
they'll have to rebuild the
support system that they lost
when coming to college. And
to do that, they need you. They
need peers who, even if they
don't know them all that well,
will be a friendly face on the
street offering a smile or some
directions; a nice person to talk
to at those awkward, somewhat
anonymous mega-parties; a
benevolent source of advice as
they prepare to read their first
Psych111chapter.
When we come back to
campus in the fall, we'll be, in a
very real sense, coming home.
Hopefully, Ann Arbor will
become a home for the incoming
students. They'll realize, as I
did only a few months ago, that
when I said, "I want to go home,"
I was no longer referring to the
place where my parents lived.
But those sorts of things take
time, and until then, we should at
least try to provide the security
their home will later provide. No
matter what kind of home these
students create for themselves
this year, the people they meet
will always be the foundation.

South Quad prepares to open doors in the fall

Guardians'

Renovations feature
upgrades to dining
hall, main floor
By SHOHAM GEVA
ManagingNews Editor
After closing for renovations last
year, South Quad Residence Hall is
preparing to re-open, ending one of
three currently ongoing construc-
tion projects in the area, along with
the Munger graduate dorm project
and the West Quad Residence Hall
renovation. Both other projects are
expected to conclude in Fall 2015.
In a media tour Friday with The
Michigan Daily, University Dining
and Housing officials showcased
several of the changes to South
Quad, most notablythe renovations
to the dining hall, which have been
the focus of the project, as well as
several other structural changes.
Construction is not yet completely
finished on the building, but Peter
Logan, University Housing com-
munications director, said the Uni-
versity is confident that it will be
done in time for move-in Aug. 28
and 29.
In the newly renovated and
expanded dining hall itself, the
clear focus has been on variety
both in terms of food and design.
The space ranges from semi-
private dining rooms with low to
the floor cushion seating, to tables

made of wood reclaimed from
bowling alleys near the grill station
Wildfire, set to feature a different
type of grilled cheese sandwich
each day.
Further back are groups of
bright pink chairs and televi-
sions mounted on the wall adja-
cent to the Smoke station, which
will serve food from an in-house
smoker. To the left, there's a clear
machine, detailed in bright orange,
set to squeeze fresh orange juice
for a station, Toast, that will serve
breakfast all day. Above it all is an
exposed clay ceiling, one of the few
unifying factors present.
Tom Smith, Michigan Dining
associate director, said the goal
was to make the separate stations
distinguishable.
"They tried to create some little
nooks for seating, tried to make it
different," he said.
The facility is based on the same
micro-restaurant concept that
is also present in East Quad. In
total, South Quad's dining hall will
have 10 separate micro-restau-
rants, including a Latin-inspired
station, a vegetarian station, an
Asian-inspired station, the Madi-
son Street Deli, a Mediterranean-
inspired station and Finale, which
will serve desserts. A chef's area
will additionally serve as a space
for cookingclasses and demonstra-
tions.
The dining hall will seat 944
people at its full capacity, Smith

said, down from an estimated 956,
due to the removal of 12 seats to
increase walkability of the space.
102 of those seats can be converted
to general community space for the
building, separate from the dining
hall.
Smith said during the first
year South Quad is in operation,
he expects that the section will
be used mostly for community
space due to the closing of West
Quad across the street, which will
reduce the number of students who
eat there. After West Quad under-
goes renovations and reopens next
year, it will no longer have a din-
ing hall, meaning many students
may choose to use their meal plans
across the street at South Quad.
The facility will require 60 full-
time employees, excluding top
management, as well as up to 400
student employees. Similar to most
other dining halls on campus, it
will be trayless.
Smith also briefly touched upon
the subject of crowding in the din-
ing halls, which has been a report-
ed issue in the newly renovated
East Quad and recently built North
Quad Residence Hall. He said with
the opening of South Quad, he
expects the number of people eat-
ing at campus dining facilities to
spread out more, easing crowding
concerns from the past few years.
South Quad is the largest dining
hall out of the new three - North
Quad seats 190 and EastQuad seats
about 400.
"Maybe hindsight is 20/20,"
Smith said. "But [South Quad] is
what made sense to do last."
He added that a highlight of
South Quad diningishoweasilyit's
expected to absorb large crowds.
"The nice thing about this facil-
ity is that when we have a push of
students - and we'll have a lot of
people in here - you won't even
feel it," he said.
Along with the dining hall, sev-
eral new community spaces for
the building have also been a part
of the renovation. Logan said over
the past few renovation projects,
Housing has typically found that
when they ask for student input,
the response is that students want
more study space, a request which
was incorporated into the South
Quad changes in several areas on
the main floor.
Other additions include a game
room, gender-inclusive restrooms
and more music practice rooms for
the building.

Marvel film focuses
on humanity in deep-
space setting
By BRIAN BURLAGE
Daily Arts Writer
In Bill Watterson's classic car-
toon strip "Calvin and Hobbes,"
one of the most intriguing of Cal-
vin's many alter
egos is Space-
man Spiff. He,
like Calvin, is a Guardiansof
young blonde-
haired kid. He the Galaxy
travels the uni-R
verse in his UFO- Rave and
like spaceship, Quality16
fighting aliens, Walt Disney
exploring aban- Studios
doned civiliza-
tions on desolate
planets and venturing into distant
realms of obscure galaxies. Many
things terrify him, and he often
doubts his heroic ability. In this
fantasy, Calvin isn't a hero per se.
He doesn't have infallible bravery;
instead, he's just a human kid. He
treks across the universe like any
of us would.
One of the early scenes of James
Gunn's "Guardians of the Galaxy"
reveals Peter Quill (Chris Pratt,
"Her"), an orphaned kid from
Earth now wandering around the
remote planet Morag. His 'out-
law' moniker, Star-Lord, poses the
same cheesiness and faux-heroism
as Calvin's. Crafty tracking shots
reveal a mask-clad Quill picking
his way through ruin, presum-
ably a long-abandoned civiliza-

tion on some planet far, far away.
The planet's landscape resembles
darker, more bizarrely colored
Utah canyons - much like Wat-
terson's. It's desolate. Quill's tiny
figure appears like a speck against
such an enormous backdrop.
Eventually, he enters a large struc-
ture draped in shadow. His gloved
hand drifts down toward his belt,
and when he pulls back his over-
coat, we see a Sony Walkman
attached to his hip. He presses
play on "Awesome Mix No. l." As
the music plays he starts to dance
around the empty structure, slid-
ing to and fro, kicking small alien
life forms, singing along with the
chorus. The scene is oddly con-
vincing: if you found yourself
alone in a strange building on
an even stranger planet and you
had your favorite music with you,
wouldn't you let it roll?
What makes this film so spe-
cial is how so many scenes evoke
this crazy yet very real sense of
humanity. Quill, like Calvin, is
so human in the way he reacts to
aliens, statements and situations.
Gunn's fusing of '70s pop songs
with a space-adventure film mere-
ly adds to its humanity. The alien
characters are blue, green and red,
they have bone-like objects pro-
truding from their head, they wear
human clothes, others wear no
clothes, some speak English, some
don't, they inhabit the severed
heads of ancient celestial beings
and they suffer from poorly orga-
nized prison systems. But in spite
of all the idiosyncrasy and inexpli-
cable variation, the story remains
believable. After all, it's not set

TheD
By ERIKA HARWOOD
Senior Arts Editor
I remember first seeing the
lineup for this year's Lollapaloo-
za and being disappointed, yet
again. I've been attending the
festival off and on for the last
six years and seem to get more
and more discouraged with each
lineup release, ultimately avoid-
ing the event all together last
year. This year there were a few
acts that stuck out: Lorde, Blood
Orange and Chance The Rap-
per, along with mainstays like
Kings of Leon, Eminem and the
traveling Outkast reunion show,
which I would have sold most
of my limbs to see, but that's
another 2,000 word article for
another time. Unsurprisingly,
I'm not gelling with the crowd of
the enormous and at times over-
whelming festival as well as I did
when I was 16, and I still don't
think I'll ever understand how
Skrillex could headline anything
past the year 2011. However, I
was continually comforted by
the presence of acts I've recently
discovered along with longtime
loves, and I refused to let some
punk ass teens who've been at
back-to-back EDM shows since 1
p.m. ruin that for me.
Friday: It Rained
I'm going to be honest. Going
to a festival with a press pass,
especially when you live in the
city where it's taking place, hps
made me lot more choosy with
my selection of shows. As I was
getting ready to leave my apart-
ment in Rogers Park on the first
day of the fest, it started to pour
down rain. This was my fourth
Lollapalooza, and if there's one
thing I've gathered from my few
years of festival experience, it's
that it will always rain. Hard. But
it will also always pass within an
hour or so at most. So, I parked
myself on my couch, cracked
open a Rolling Rock and watched
the previous night's "Colbert
Report". The first show I was
really eager about was Blood
Orange, which wasn't until the
late afternoon, and frankly there
just aren't enough drugs in the

aily at
world for me to willingly g
outside for extended periods o
time while it's pouring rain. I'm
assuming I've reached the apex
of adulthood.
When I finally arrived at Gran
Park a little before 4 p.m. to meet
up with a friend for the Blood
orange show, I realized tha
things had changed from the las
time I was there. The line to ge
in seemed to take forever, and i
probably didn't help that I was in
a rush while also being surround
ed by drunk high schoolers. Afte

tent to grab a drink before the
show. After wandering around
aimlessly for a bit, I gave up and
decided to go early and park i
up front for Blood Orange. Afte

sported homemade T-shirts with
messages against police brutality
and both made statements durin

making it all the more disturbin
when just hours later the couple
accused security of physically
assaulting them.
I left the show a few song
early, determined to finally make
it the press tent per the origina
plan. As I walked toward the
south end of the park, I coul

o little to no shame when I say
f that I think it's great, albeit over-
a played. That said, hearing it echo
x through Grant Park really brings
out the worst in people, myself
t included. Elbowing my way

s But I persevered, eventually
making my way to a place where
I had room to move without risk-
ing having other people's sweat
form a layer over my own. I ran
into a co-worker from my intern-
ship and we decided to catch the
last bit of Lorde together. On
the way over, I convinced him
that her album was great and
she did, in fact, have more songs
than "Royals" and "Team," yet
the only ones we managed to
see were those two along with
"Ribs." Good looking out, Ella.
e We headed back to get sta-

d tially planned on skipping for
t Phantogram - I'm glad I didn't.
T He came out and immediately
t exploded with the energy he
f seemed to be lacking the past few
p years. During the set, someone

- showed up and I freaked the hell
- out. In retrospect, it made per-
r fecetsense; the show was the ideal
h dress rehearsal/PR move for
y Eminem and Rihanna's upcom-
g ing The Monster Tour. Although
it didn't morph into the strictly-
g Rihanna set I secretly hoped it
- would (they only performed the
y songs they've recorded together),
it was the detail the set didn't
s necessarily need but undoubted-
e ly cemented it as one of the best
l shows of the weekend.
