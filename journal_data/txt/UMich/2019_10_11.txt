Hillary 
Clinton, 
former 
U.S. Secretary of State and 
2016 Democratic presidential 
nominee, spoke at Rackham 
Auditorium 
Thursday 
afternoon to an audience of 
more than 1,000 students and 
community members, including 
U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell, 
D-Mich., and Michigan state 
Rep. Rebekah Warren, D-Ann 
Arbor. 
Clinton has spent decades 
in public service, serving as 
first lady from 1993 to 2001, 
U.S. senator from 2001 to 
2009 and secretary of state 
from 2009 to 2013 under the 
Obama administration. After a 
presidential campaign loss in 
2016, Clinton still has a large 
political influence.
Michael S. Barr, dean of the 
Ford School of Public Policy, 
moderated the talk, and the 
subsequent 
student 
Q&A 
session was the inaugural event 
of the University of Michigan’s 
Weiser 
Diplomacy 
Center’s 
lecture series on diplomacy and 
foreign affairs. During the talk, 
Clinton 
answered 
questions 
about global affairs, her career 
experience and her opinions on 
contemporary foreign policy 
issues. 
Clinton began by discussing 
the 
changing 
role 
of 
multinational institutions in 
shaping international affairs, 
emphasizing 
the 
need 
to 
work with allies and rely on 
institutions such as the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
In evaluating when to use 
different modes of diplomacy, 
she referenced the example of 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
recent withdrawal of troops 
from northern Syria, clearing 
the way for a Turkish military 
operation against U.S.-allied 
Kurdish forces. According to 

Clinton, Turkey’s membership 
in 
NATO 
could 
help 
ease 
diplomatic negotiations.
“There are ways of working 
on really thorny — what are 
called wicked — problems,” 
Clinton said. “But they take 
thought 
and 
deliberation 
and diplomacy. Yes, we have 
the common bond of NATO 
membership, we could have 
used that, and now we have 
a situation with all kinds of 
consequences, both predictable 
and unintended.”
Referring 
specifically 
to 
NATO, Clinton acknowledged 
the 
existence 
of 
problems 
within 
international 
and 
domestic 
institutions, 
but 
emphasized the importance of 
maintaining and using them for 
the public good. Clinton noted 
the work of various leaders 
during a post-World War II 
period of international order; 

leaders who upheld standards 
of peace and democracy. In 
the 
face 
of 
interests 
that 
want to disrupt faith in these 
institutions, she emphasized 
standing by this institutions 
while trying to reform them. 
“There is also a concerted 
effort to undermine our faith in 
these international institutions. 
There is a real effort by some 
to try to create dislocation and 
disruption,” Clinton said. “We 
should be standing up for the 
success of the last 75 years, not 
throwing it on the trash heap of 
history. We need to engage now 
in a new process of trying to 
restore and renew and, where 
necessary, reform and replace 
institutions that are not serving 
us well.”
Public Policy junior Nick 
Silk was one of a select group 
of students who attended a 
talk with Clinton before the 
main 
event, 
during 
which 
students were able to ask 
questions 
of 
Clinton 
about 
developing leadership skills for 
careers in public policy. Silk 
was impressed by Clinton’s 
personal experience working in 
diplomacy. 
Silk said Clinton’s advice 
and remarks to public policy 
students fit in with the Public 
Policy 
School’s 
mission 
of 
developing leaders who make a 
positive difference in the world.
“The 
school’s 
theme 
of 
leadership is making a positive 
impact upon others,” Silk said. 
“So she really honed in on that 
aspect of using empathy to 
build relationships with other 
people, and also building trust 
with other people, relying on 
others and, at the same time, 
kind of cultivating this culture 
that’s 
responsive 
to 
other 
people, and building teams 
rather than being divisive.”

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Japanese 
artist 
Mari 
Katayama 
came 
to 
the 
Michigan Theater Thursday 
evening as part of the Penny 
Stamps Speaker Series to 
discuss 
living 
with 
her 
disabilities 
and 
the 
art 
they have inspired. This 
event was one of the many 

scheduled 
for 
Disability 
Community Month at the 
University 
of 
Michigan. 
About 500 students and Ann 
Arbor residents attended to 
listen to Katayama open up 
about the thought process 
behind her most provocative 
pieces. 
Before 
the 
discussion, 
Natsu Oyobe, the curator 
of Katayama’s exhibit at 
the 
UMMA, 
introduced 

Katayama 
and 
gave 
a 
background of her work. 
Katayama was born with a 
developmental condition and 
had both her legs amputated 
at nine years old. She has 
had a long artistic career 
in multimedia that started 
when she was a teenager. 
Her first solo exhibition in 
the United States is coming 
to UMMA later this month. 
“Mari started making art 

to fill the deep gap between 
her own understanding of 
self and society,” Oyobe said. 
“She explores her identity 
by objectifying her body 
through art.” 
Katayama 
explored 
these ideas further during 
her 
talk 
by 
giving 
her 
own 
perspective 
through 
translator Megumi Segawa. 

The 
final 
pretrial 
for 
a 
lawsuit 
against 
eight 

climate 
demonstrators 

charged 
with 
trespassing 
on 
University 
of 
Michigan 
property took place Thursday 
morning in the Washtenaw 
County 
Courthouse. 
The 
demonstrators were arrested in 
March after a climate-focused 
sit-in at University President 
Mark Schlissel’s office, which 
followed 
the 
Washtenaw 
County Climate Strike on the 
same day.
The 
demonstrators’ 
chief 
demand at the sit-in was a one-
hour meeting with Schlissel 
and other members of the 
administration to discuss the 
University’s plan to achieve 
carbon neutrality. A group of 
demonstrators refused to leave 
until the University addressed 
their demands, which resulted 
in the arrests of 10 individuals 
on charges of trespassing — two 
of whom were minors, though 
the prosecutor’s office is only 
charging people over 18.

Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaks on current political events and related policy issues at Rackham Auditorium Thursday afternoon.

Auditorium Thursday afternoon.


College students go nuts for 
squirrels, but at the University 
of Michigan researchers have 
taken an interest as well. 
U-M is one of several schools 
participating in a research 
project called the Kluane Red 
Squirrel Project.
Ben Dantzer, an assistant 
professor of Psychology and 
Ecology 
and 
Evolutionary 
Biology at the University, leads 
the research project based in 
Yukon, Canada. The study has 
been going on for 30 years, 
making it the longest running 
research project of its kind and 
focuses on North American 
red squirrels. The goal of the 
project is to learn what allows 

an animal to be successful 
in survival and reproduction 
over generations.
Dantzer said his research 
allows 
scientists 
to 
know 
more about how an animal’s 
early life affects its adulthood 
traits and behaviors, which 
can often be applied to human 
topics as well. 
“We know that these things 
may occur in rats and mice 
in laboratory environments,” 
Danzter said. “It may occur 
in humans but we can’t do 
experiments on humans for 
obvious reasons, and then lab 
mice have a lot of artifacts 
where the environment is 
constant: they have constant 
food, they’re comfortable, they 
are fat and happy, literally. In 
wild animals, you can kind of 
study whether those things 

happen in nature where they 
are experiencing fluctuations 
in their environments and 
that’s going to impact those 
things.”
The team is also able to 
learn more about the impacts 
of climate change by observing 
how the changing conditions 
affect the squirrels, Dantzer 
said. 
“They give us an idea of 
how animals will respond 
to global and environmental 
changes in terms of reductions 
in winter severity, changes 
in 
precipitation 
patterns, 
warming 
pattern, 
things 
like that,” Dantzer said. “So 
if we’re able to study these 
types of questions of how they 
adapt to changes in global 
climate, then that can help us 
to understand better things 
about how other animals 
might adapt to changing 
climates.”
Dantzer 
expressed 
his 
excitement 
about 
another squirrel research 
project being conducted 
right on campus. This is 
led by Rackham student 
Charlotte Devits, who is 
researching 
the 
effects 
that an urban environment 
has on the survival of 
wildlife. Devits’s thesis 
project aims to discover 
how an urban environment 
such as Ann Arbor affects 
the behavior of wildlife. 
Devits 
tags 
squirrels, 
which allows researchers 
to 
track 
the 
squirrels 
and 
maintain 
personal 
information about each 
one.
The squirrels are tagged 
in the Nichols Arboretum, 
but they eventually make 
their way to the Diag and 
other parts of campus. In 
an interview posted to 
the 
Matthaei 
Botanical 
Gardens 
& 
Nichols 

Arboretum’s website, Devits 
said she hopes to uncover 
what traits help our squirrels 
— formally known as Fox 
Squirrels — survive in this 
environment, as well as other 
cities and urban environments. 
She’s also recording data on 
health factors, for example, 
observing each squirrel for 
wounds, parasites, mange and 
other conditions.
“We’re trying to understand 
what allows the species to 
cope with different levels of 
urbanization,” Devitz said in 
the interview. “We focus on 
personality traits to see if a 
particular behavior is present 
across the study sites.”
Devitz did not respond to 
an interview request from The 
Michigan Daily. 
LSA senior Sanjana Ramesh 
said she loves the campus 
squirrels and did some digging 
into what the ear tags were 
when she noticed them.
“I 
just 
really 
like 
the 
squirrels,” 
Ramesh 
said. 
“There’s this whole meme 
going around on the internet 
about 
how 
our 
campus’s 
squirrels are the best, and I 
can definitely conform to that. 
I think that the whole part of 
the squirrel tags was just new 
and I’m really curious.”
Ramesh said that, as a 
senior, she had never seen 
squirrels with ear tags on 
campus.
“I just thought it was 
interesting, and I wanted to 
know why,” Ramesh said. “I do 
know that other animals are 
tagged, so I wanted to know. 
I figured it was a research 
thing because that’s usually 
what it is … Thankfully, it 
was research and they’re not 
trying to kill our squirrels. I 
was really scared they were 
trying to kill our squirrels.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
I always say that I feel like a freshman here on campus, because I 
obviously don’t know the campus as well and stuff like that, but 
sometimes being in these classes with all these freshmen, you just kind 
of feel like you’re out of place. You come here to Michigan for more 
opportunities, but I feel like I’m being set back more than pushed 
forward sometimes.”

Zoe Garden, LSA junior, discussing her experience as a transfer student at the University

Every Friday, one Daily staffer will give a behind the scenes look 
at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA senior Julia Fanzeres 
discussed covering a protest of former Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton, who visited campus on Thursday to give a lecture at 
Rackham Auditorium.

“It was really frustrating because the demonstrator was cooperating 
with us and wanted to have her voice heard, but the DPSS officer 
interjected and advised her not to speak to us. It delegitimized the 
role of journalists in covering protests, and it diminished the quality 
of our coverage because we were able to get that demonstrator’s 
perspectives.”

Pointing to pictures of her 
childhood displayed on the 
screen behind her, Katayama 
talked 
about 
how 
she 
struggled with the physical 
differences between her and 
other children her age. 
“I 
thought 
once 
I 
amputated my legs, I could 
wear the same shoes other 
people wore,” Katayama said 
through a translator. “Once 
my legs were amputated, 
what I had was a reality that 
was different from what I 
thought. So, there was a gap 
between my ideal situation 
and my real situation.” 
Katayama said it is this 
difference 
that 
fueled 
her art. When she was a 
teenager, Katayama began 
painting 
her 
prosthetic 

legs with intricate flower 
designs. At this age, she was 
also a model in student-run 
fashion shows as well as her 
own photography. Later, she 
turned to sewing as a form 
of artistic expression. She 
explained that her process 
began by first taking her 
own picture, then uploading 
it to a computer and editing 
it, then printing it on to 
fabric 
and 
then 
sewing 
the 
fabric 
together. 
In 
some of her earlier pieces, 
Katayama posed with her 
sewn creations in self-taken 
photographs. 
“The reason why I did 
everything myself is because 
I just didn’t want anybody 
to see me like this, I was too 
shy,” Katayama said.
In a Q&A segment during 
the presentation, Katayama 
was asked about her courage 
in showing her body in the 

era of social media and 
Photoshop. Katayama said 
she views her body as a 
material in her art.
“Maybe because I don’t 
consider these images as 
myself,” Katayama said. “I’m 
objectifying my own body 
and using it as a material. … 
I’m actually not accepting 
the way I am, my daughter 
loves my body, but to me, I 
still pursue a perfect body.” 
Art & Design freshman 
Nehema Kariuki attended 
the event and enjoyed seeing 
the artist behind the work, 
which she said she does not 
get to experience often.
“In a lot of artists’ art, you 
see the art but you don’t see 
the artists themselves — you 
don’t see who they are, you 
don’t see their emotion,” 
Kariuki 
said. 
“It’s 
nice 
seeing her in her work and 
her emotion tied into it.” 

“Unfortunately, we cannot 
control some of the construction 
traffic. But for students, keeping 
a little bit of extra time to get to 
where they need to go is a good 
strategy.”
LSA senior Selene Yang has 
lived on North Campus all 
four years at the University. 
Especially 
in 
the 
morning, 
Yang said the detours have 
lengthened her commute from 
about 15 minutes to about 30 to 
45 minutes. 
“Today 
and 
Tuesday, 
I 
was really late to my 9 a.m. 
class because all the buses 
are getting stuck on Central 
Campus, and they can’t get up 
to North Campus,” Yang said. 
“There’s a lot of traffic, and a 
lot of people trying to get down 
to Central.”
Engineering junior Zachary 
Wernet said he often has 
to 
travel 
between 
Central 
and North Campuses for his 
classes. Though he believes 
construction benefits the city 

overall, Wernet said he thinks 
the projects should have been 
more spread out over time. 
“I just think it’s excessive 
how many different routes have 
changed in all these different 
ways,” Wernet said. “(The city) 
could’ve 
done 
construction 
to affect one or two routes at 
a time, rather than an entire 
dictionary of changes.” 
Solomon 
explained 
that 
LTP notifies the University 
community of route changes 
with transit alerts on their 
website. 
The 
transit 
live-
tracking app DoubleMap, which 
shows bus routes and locations, 
has also been updated to reflect 
the detours. 
Yang said the route detours 
announcement, 
which 
was 
formatted 
as 
a 
list, 
could 
be hard to understand. She 
wondered 
whether 
a 
map 
showing all the detours would 
be more effective.
“The post they made was just 
about (the detours) was just a 
huge block of text instead of 
maybe showing it on a map,” 
Yang said. “That could visually 
show which stops might’ve 

been changed or how the route 
looks now as compared to how 
it used to be.”
Solomon explained some of 
the detours will last a relatively 
short amount of time, so LTP 
did not think a visual aid was 
needed. 
“So, sometimes we do this, it 
just depends on the length and 
nature of the detour,” Solomon 
said. “Some of the detours are 
less complicated or pretty short, 
and so we may not do it for that. 
But if they are about to take a 
route, and if operating, they can 
definitely pull it up in the live 
app.”
Prior to Solomon speaking 
with The Daily, none of the 
recent transit alerts included 
any maps. Since then, a map has 
been attached in the Washtenaw 
Avenue lane closures alert for 
the Bursley-Baits, Northwood 
Express, 
Commuter 
North, 
Diag-to-Diag 
Express 
and 
Oxford Shuttle routes. 
Overall, Yang said the detours 
have exacerbated an already-
frustrating morning commute. 
“Billy Magic didn’t warn me 
for this,” Yang said.

Ann Arbor attorney Angie 
Martell 
is 
representing 
all 
trespassers in the case. Two of 
the defendants were excused 
from Thursday’s hearing due to 
travel.
Approximately 90 people sat 
in the audience. Many attendees 
wore green in solidarity with 
the Washtenaw County Climate 
Action Movement, which was 
responsible for organizing the 
climate strike and sit-in.
Martell began by stating she 
only received five out of the 
seven compact disks containing 
footage 
she 
expected 
to 
receive. She said the disks she 
did receive did not have audio, 
which she said does not align 
with what she was told in 
discovery. Martell also noted 
the potential information from 
the additional CDs and audio 
could impact how she presents 
her case.
Additionally, 
Martell 
described 
the 
lawsuit 
against her clients as a “civil 
disobedience” case, in which 
people disobey the law to 
prevent greater harm. In this 
instance, 
Martell 
said 
the 
demonstrators were trespassing 
to avoid climate change-related 
harm in the future.
“We feel that without this 
information — which is only in 
the hands of the University — 
we are hampered in having a 
fair trial in this case,” Martell 
said. “This case is not just about 
the trespass; it’s about one day 
in which, across the globe, 1.4 
million young people came out 
to talk about bringing light 
to the current situation and 
the threat of climate change 
inaction. And it’s the belief 
of many of the defendants 
in this case, or members of 
the University at large, that 
the University been slow and 
reluctant to address some of 
these issues.”
However, 
Joseph 
Simon, 
an Ann Arbor-based criminal 
attorney 
representing 
the 
University, said the power of 
discovery in a criminal case is 
not the same as in other cases. 
He said attorneys do not have 
vehicles of discovery in any 

criminal case, so it would be 
unfair to allow the defense to 
obtain evidence in this lawsuit.
Washtenaw County Assistant 
Prosecutor, 
Ashley 
Londy, 
brought all the disks in her 
possession 
to 
the 
pretrial 
and said she could provide 
additional copies if Martell was 
missing any of them. Londy said 
there was no bad faith displayed 
in her team’s handling of the 
footage.
“No one is editing any of 
these 
videos,” 
Londy 
said. 
“We’ve turned over everything 
that we have, and if we haven’t, 
we absolutely will. We are in 
a pretrial phase in this case — 
it is not the morning of trial. 
We’re not ambushing anyone, 
because we don’t believe in trial 
by ambush.” 
Martell responded by saying 
she 
was 
not 
accusing 
the 
prosecution of editing footage, 
but rather making sure the 
University had disclosed all the 
evidence.
After both sides spoke, Judge 
Karen 
Quinlan 
Valvo 
said 
she did not feel Martell acted 
maliciously in her requests and 
was not placing sanctions on 
her. However, she said Martell’s 
requests for evidence would not 
be completed. 
There was a short break 
for 
attorneys 
to 
check 
in 
with their clients. Once back 
on the record, one of the 
demonstrators took a plea deal 
that was made available to all 
defendants charged.
The settlement conference 
was 
scheduled 
for 
Jan. 
2 
and the trial for Jan. 13 at 9 
a.m. Valvo said the trial will 
continue on Jan. 14 at 10 a.m. 
if necessary.
The defense pleaded not 
guilty 
and 
were 
arraigned 
during the first pretrial on 
June 17. A trespassing charge 
bears a maximum charge of a 
$250 fine with a potential of 
30 days in jail. At this hearing, 
demonstrators were released 
on a personal recognizance 
bond, meaning they did not 
have to pay bail. They were told 
they cannot enter the Fleming 
Administration Building, leave 
the state without permission 
of the court or use alcohol or 
marijuana. 
However, 
Valvo 
lifted the ban for defendants 
over 21 to accommodate for the 

Jewish holiday.
Groups such as the Huron 
Valley Area Labor Federation 
and 
Young 
Democratic 
Socialists of America, as well 
as politicians including former 
gubernatorial 
candidate 
Abdul El-Sayed and current 
candidate 
for 
Washtenaw 
County prosecutor Eli Savit, 
have expressed support for the 
defendants. 
On 
April 
9, 
Schlissel 
and other members of the 
President’s 
Commission 
on 
Carbon Neutrality held a public 
session to discuss some of 
the demonstrators’ concerns 
and strategies to move the 
University closer to carbon 
neutrality. 
The 
Commision 
also held a forum on Sept. 25 
to address concerns about the 
University’s progress in this 
area. 
In a September interview 
with The Daily, Schlissel said 
the Commission on Carbon 
Neutrality is still working on 
solutions on how to achieve 
carbon 
neutrality 
while 
maintaining 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
University’s 
heating 
system and building plans. He 
acknowledged, though, that in 
the long term carbon neutrality 
must happen. 
“It costs more money, so 
it’ll slow down some of our 
ambitions, but we’re going to 
try to strike the right balance 
between continuing to be a 
great place to go to school and 
a research university and a 
great health system, and then 
being proper stewards of the 
environment,” Schlissel said. 
“So, in the short term, I can’t 
envision a way to get out of 
fossil fuel use entirely, but 
longer term I think we have to, 
and the challenge is, how long 
it’s going to take and what the 
options are to get there.”
After the hearing, LSA senior 
Kristen Hayden told The Daily 
she attended the pretrial in 
solidarity 
with 
the 
people 
charged. 
Hayden 
also 
said 
she felt the University should 
acknowledge its role in the trial 
and withdraw so the prosecutor 
does not have a strong case 
against the defendants.

Later in the conversation, 
Clinton 
weighed 
in 
on 
current 
impeachment 
proceedings against Trump, 
describing 
the 
role 
of 
Ukraine’s “growing pains” 
to modernize their economy 
and stabilize politically. She 
explained how Ukraine is in 
a difficult position, needing 
to deter Russian aggression 
while relying on U.S. aid. She 
believes 
the 
impeachment 
proceedings are justified but 
must be thorough.
“The 
whole 
Ukrainian 
scandal in the midst of the 
impeachment 
inquiry, 
in 
and of itself, is troubling 
because of what it shows 
about abuse of power and 
the 
use 
of 
threats 
and 
extortion by the President 
of the United States,” she 
said. “Withholding military 
aid that they so desperately 
need to defend themselves. 
So, it’s a scandal, it’s an 
absolutely 
inappropriate 
scandal and it should trigger 
an impeachment inquiry.”
Sen. Gary Peters is the 
only Michigan Democrat not 
to have voiced support for 
impeachment investigations. 
Senator 
Debbie 
Stabenow, 
D-Mich., 
announced 
her 
support 
for 
beginning 
proceedings in July. In a 
statement, 
Peters 
echoed 
concerns 
for 
national 
security.
Clinton also shared her 

personal views on U.S. policy 
in the Middle East, reflecting 
on 
the 
role 
of 
former 
President 
Barack 
Obama’s 
administration in the Syrian 
war. According to Clinton, 
current 
international 
relations could lead to a 
possible 
ISIS 
resurgence, 
and the multitude of national 
interests complicate the path 
toward a diplomatic solution. 
“This is going to be a 
difficult 
period, 
and 
it 
requires intense, intelligent 
diplomacy. And right now, 
we have very little of that,” 
Clinton said. 
The event was not without 
controversy. Half a dozen 
demonstrators, 
voicing 
support for Trump, protested 
outside of Rackham during 
Clinton’s talk. The protestors 
held signs reading “TRUMP 
2020” 
and 
wore 
“Make 
America Great Again” hats as 
a crowd of counter-protestors 
surrounded them.
One of the protestors, who 
chose to remain nameless, 
stated she was protesting in 
order to show support for 
President Trump. 
“I 
was 
supporting 
my 
president, 
didn’t 
you 
see 
that?” the protester said. “I 
support my president all the 
time.”
About 50 students and 
community members urged 
the 
protestors 
to 
leave 
campus 
and 
yelled 
they 
were not “on the right side 
of history.” LSA sophomore 
Tiahna Pantovich took part in 
the counter-protest, calling 
out to the protestors holding 

Trump signs on campus. 
“Nobody’s 
really 
on 
your side,” Pantovich said, 
pointing at the protestors. “I 
hope you know that.”
Throughout the protest, 
the demonstrators remained 
silent 
aside 
from 
a 
few 
remarks in response to the 
counter-protestors’ yelling. 
Ann Arbor resident Robin 
Wonder also attended the 
counter-protest. 
After 
the 
incident, Wonder said he 
was protesting in response 
to 
Trump’s 
policies 
on 
immigration, which he said 
are oppressive and inhumane. 
“Guess 
what?” 
Wonder 
said. “They’re not welcome 
here, right? I’m not OK with 
Trump. Trump deported my 
mom, and she did nothing 
wrong. Nothing. She just 
came here for a better life. 
They’re just trying to get 
everybody out for no fucking 
reason.” 
After Clinton spoke, LSA 
junior 
Brianna 
Morigney 
told The Daily she came to 
the event to learn more about 
Clinton’s 
perspective 
on 
international policy. 
“I think the biggest thing 
that stuck with me is when 
she said we need to help 
people abroad to make our 
borders safer, which is an 
interesting 
perspective 
because usually you hear 
border safety coming from 
the other side,” Morigney 
said. “It’s important to have 
that view of, ‘We’re not 
helping who we need to help, 
and that’s why our borders 
are at risk.’”

Guest 
speakers 
from 
South Africa, Colombia and 
Michigan State University 
discussed 
transitional 
justice in their communities 
on 
Thursday 
afternoon 
in 
Weill 
Hall. 
About 
65 
students attended the event, 
titled “Critical Engagement 
with 
Transitional 
Justice: 
Perspectives from Africa and 
Latin America.” 
The 
Center 
for 
Latin 
American 
and 
Caribbean 
Studies, the African Studies 
Center, the Donia Human 
Rights Center and the Ford 
School 
of 
Public 
Policy 
sponsored the event.
Yazier Henry, lecturer of 
public policy in the Public 
Policy School, moderated the 
event. Henry and the speakers 
had 
met 
previously 
at 
a 
conference in Berlin, and this 
was the first time they had 
reunited since that encounter. 
Henry 
said 
transitional 
justice 
— 
how 
countries 
address large-scale human 
rights abuses — played a role 
in his decision to become a 
lecturer at the Public Policy 
School.
“From the engagement — 
past, present, future — in the 
context of societies building 
peace, 
that 
the 
things 
through this promise of what 
(it means to have) greater 
democracy, what it means to 
have greater social justice, 

what it means to have human 
rights systems as accepted,” 
Henry said. 
Henry asked the panelists 
about their experiences with 
transitional justice. 
Within 
the 
idea 
of 
transitional justice, much of 
the conversation surrounded 
the Truth and Reconciliation 
Committee that formed in 
South Africa after the end of 
Apartheid.
The 
Truth 
and 
Reconciliation 
Committee 
was 
created 
for 
victims 
of 
Apartheid 
to 
express 
their 
grievances 
toward 
the 
victimizers 
in 
order 
to receive justice for the 
crimes 
committed 
under 
the regime. When Henry 
asked the speakers about the 
disappointments 
they 
had 
with transitional justice in 
their own countries, panelist 
Litheko Modisane of South 
Africa spoke to the flaws of 
the Truth and Reconciliation 
Committee.
“Now the South African 
case 
is 
quite 
complex, 
because on the one hand, the 
truth, whatever you may call 
that truth, it was exposed 
during the TRC,” Modisane 
said. “There are other larger 
questions that still remain. 
For instance, part of the 
mechanism of the TRC was 
that there will be reparations 
for the victims of violence 
and human rights abuses. 
However, to this day, that has 
not really happened.”
Castillejo-Cuellar, who is a 

professor at the Universidad 
de 
los 
Andes, 
went 
to 
graduate school in Colombia 
and 
published 
“Memories 
and 
Violence: 
Problems 
and Debates in a Global 
Perspective,” a book about 
memory and displacement in 
an international context. His 
initial research was about 
the effects of violence in 
Colombia.
Panelist 
Alejandro 
Castillejo-Cuellar discussed 
how his work in Colombia 
inspired his first book and 
research interests.
“As an anthropologist, I 
was interested in fieldwork, 
and try to understand how 
actual 
people 
reconstruct 
the 
world 
with 
a 
world 
that is broken by violence,” 
Castillejo-Cuellar said. 
Rackham 
student 
Tim 
Berke 
said 
he 
found 
it 
interesting to hear about 
the role of colonialism in 
restorative justice.
“I 
think 
hearing 
some 
of the questions from the 
group and the response from 
some of those was really 
interesting and to think about 
restorative justice, in a sense, 
and about colonialism,” Berke 
said. “And how that applies 
really opened my mind up 
to what that can imply and 
how far back we think about 
transitional 
justice 
and 
restorative justice.”

LSA senior Molly Mearn, an 
executive board member for the 
Squirrel Club, said she thought 
the research was great, as long 
as it did not pose a threat to the 
safety of the squirrels.
“If there’s a valid scientific 
motivation 
to 
the 
tagging, 
and the tagging is done in a 
way that minimizes harm to 
the squirrels, I think it’s not 
too bad,” Mearns said. “But if 
there isn’t really a benefit to 
it and it harms the squirrels, 
then I don’t see a reason for it. 
I think, compared to previous 
years, there are slightly fewer 
squirrels around campus and 
in the Diag in particular, so I’m 
not sure if there is a population 
control 
issue 
right 
now. 

Additionally, I haven’t really 
noticed any aggression from 
squirrels, so I hope that isn’t 
part of the concern.”
In terms of work being done 
to ensure the safety of the 
squirrels, Dantzer said wild 
animal researchers must follow 
a set of rules that govern how 
invasive tagging can be. The 
rules state that a tag or monitor 
can be no more than 5 percent 
of the animal’s body weight. 
He and Devits adhere to this 
strictly. 
He said that a great deal of 
research has been conducted on 
how squirrels are affected by 
being tagged and collared, and 
so far, no studies have indicated 
any sort of negative outcomes 
from human intervention.
Dantzer said he has big 
plans for the future of squirrel 
research, 
as 
he 
plans 
to 

hopefully use microchips to 
track squirrels’ heart rates 
and brain activity in order to 
determine sleep patterns. This 
information 
will 
hopefully 
give scientists insight into 
why 
humans 
and 
animals 
need sleep in order to survive. 
However, Dantzer said he is 
hesitant to do this now, as he 
would not want to introduce a 
more invasive tracking device 
that would negatively impact 
the campus squirrels.
“We’re not yet going to do 
these implants in the squirrels 
(on campus), and part of it is 
because I think that, for most 
people, each day the only 
wildlife they ever interact with 
is these squirrels, and that’s 
a very valuable thing for us to 
have because it maintains some 
sense of awareness of nature,” 
Dantzer said.

RILEY DEHR | COLUMN

Let them eat ramen!
I 

hurriedly 
typed 
out 
the 
last 
lines 
of 
my 
essay and logged out of 
the 
computer. 
The 
printer 
grumbled 
along 
with 
my 
stomach as it spat out sheets 
of paper. My Mac had died on 
me the day before, so I was 
trapped in a dark computer lab 
completing an assignment. It 
wasn’t due until the next day, 
but I had to finish it before 
I went home for the night 
and made dinner; something 
I desperately needed as the 
fluorescent 
lights 
shocked 
my hungry brain. I shoved my 
things into my backpack and 
rushed to the faulty stapler, 
which crushed its only staple 
into my title page. I rubbed my 
now aching head as I searched 
for my professor’s office in the 
labyrinth of hallways known 
as the East Quad basement. I 
tossed my papers under her 
door and made a beeline for 
the exit. 
At the top of the stairs, a 
line of chattering freshmen 
and sophomores waited to get 
their Mcards swiped as the 
staff began serving dinner in 
the dining hall. I would have 
joined them if I hadn’t opted 
out of the school’s insanely 
expensive meal plan when I 
moved into my own apartment. 
My mouth watered at the smell 
of deep-fried something that 
filled the air. Ten minutes 
later, I finally made it to my 
apartment and popped three 
ibuprofen in my mouth to 
soothe 
my 
hunger-induced 
migraine before having pizza 
rolls for dinner — the first 
thing I had eaten since 10 a.m.
While going hungry like 

this is rare for me, for many 
students it’s the norm. 
The 
skyrocketing 
price 
of attending college, paired 
with more socioeconomically 
diverse 
student 
bodies, 
has made student hunger a 
growing issue. 

In fact, in 2016, nearly half 
of all college students reported 
going hungry at least once 
in the past month. The scale 
of 
the 
problem 
prompted 
Michigan’s own Sen. Debbie 
Stabenow 
and 
presidential 
candidate 
Sen. 
Elizabeth 
Warren, D-Mass., to request 
that 
Congress 
investigate 
the issue. The Government 
Accountability Office found 
that more than 30 percent of 
students are at significant risk 
of consistently going hungry. 
This may only be the tip of the 
iceberg, however, as the issue 
is severely understudied. 
Often food insecurity most 
severely affects those who 
are 
already 
struggling 
the 
most. Students who are low 

income, 
first-generation 
or have children often find 
themselves having to work 
many hours or, as in my 
mother’s case, multiple jobs 
to put food on the table. This 
severely inhibits their ability 
to succeed in school and 
decreases their likelihood of 
graduating. 
Universities 
have 
used 
food pantries to Band-Aid 
the issue, but they fall short 
of finding a solution. With 
the endowments of the 10 
richest schools equaling a 
whopping $155.6 billion, we 
deserve more than Band-
Aids. 
Colleges, 
and 
four-year 
universities 
in 
particular, 
should provide all of their 
students with free meal plans. 
Even those who aren’t parents 
or 
low-income 
students 
shouldn’t have to pay upwards 
of $50,000 in tuition costs and 
still wonder where they’re 
getting lunch.
No student — whether they 
be a single mother trying to 
feed her child or a sorority 
girl cramming for an exam 
in the Shapiro Undergraduate 
Library — should go hungry 
while 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan plays with more 
than $7 billion. As $1 billion 
go toward the construction 
of new projects and even 
$10,000-a-day 
private 
jet 
excursions on occasion, myself 
and 
many 
other 
students 
must continue to plan our 
days around when, or if, they 
should eat.

Redefining privilege
T

he 
concept 
of 
white 
privilege 
was 
first 
contextualized 
in 
Peggy 
McIntosh’s 
1988 article, “White 
Privilege: 
Unpacking 
the 
Invisible 
Knapsack,” 
which 
pioneered putting the 
social 
construction 
of 
privilege 
in 
the 
theoretical 
frameworks 
of 
power, gender, race, 
class 
and 
sexuality. 
Highlighting 
the 
advantages associated with her 
identity as a white, cisgender, 
able-bodied American woman, 
McIntosh demonstrated that 
there are invisible forces that 
condition society to believe 
in and behave according to 
a particular status quo — we 
work to create and sustain a 
community that is meant to 
serve only a subset of the diverse 
population. Per her article, 
white privilege is evidenced in 
the satisfaction of being widely 
represented in the mainstream 
media, freedom from racial 
profiling 
and 
selective 
entitlements that surely are not 
transferrable to all. This notion 
that privilege — namely, white 
privilege — is an unconscious 
threat to diversity has since 
taken a strong foothold across 
all sociopolitical movements 
in the United States, with 
politicians 
promising 
to 
recognize 
it, 
industries 
designating diversity offices 
to acknowledge it and schools 
designing curricula to teach it. 
These interpretations and 
relative 
understandings, 
however, do little to inspire 
action.
Subsequently, 
McIntosh’s 
version of white privilege has 
primarily been interpreted as 
highlighting issues of cosmetics 
and 
inconvenience. 
Hence, 
white privilege has become a 
new buzzword to be casually 
tossed in political discourse, 
a definitive answer to layered 
issues. Considering how white 
individuals find representation 

in entertainment or live their 
entire 
lives 
without 
being 
subject to police brutality, 
this 
definition 
can 
be 
grossly 
ignorant 
of 
the 
racialized 
origins 
of 
oppression. 
Everyone has the 
right to equal pay, 
the right to bodily 
autonomy, the right 
to a presumption 
of 
innocence 
and the right to 
police 
protection 
regardless of their identity. 
Terming these selective rights 
as privileges takes away from 
what 
McIntosh 
argued 
all 
along: That our understanding 
of entitlement itself stems from 
a legacy of racism. So, rather 
than addressing these social 
phenomena as privilege, we 
should ask why others act upon 
the same claim. 
Framing inequalities in the 
context of rights rather than 
privileges is the first step in 
achieving large scale systemic 
change, a position McIntosh 
opposes. As it pertains to 
white privilege, for instance, 
is a white woman subject to 
the same privileges as a white 
man? How does this label 
apply to the different strata 
of 
socioeconomic 
status? 
The 
discourse 
of 
privilege 
creates 
intangible, 
abstract 
dichotomies 
that 
offer 
no 
leverage for systemic change 
and unnecessarily pits minority 
groups against each other and 
everyone else. Our energy as 
individuals and as a collective 
whole should instead focus on 
a 
productive 
understanding 
of rights certain groups lack 
and how we can even out the 
playing field so all can achieve 
those rights. After all, most 
of the rights that we consider 
privileges today are a result of 
systematically depriving other 
populations of those rights. 
Addressing these will have a 
greater impact in the long run, 
one that stems beyond making 
others contemplate and feel 

guilty for what they have. 
Dialogues around privilege 
tend to establish a pretentious 
hierarchy, as well. In a recent 
study analyzing the privilege 
and reception of white women 
and women of color within 
the Peace Corps, the crux of 
the argument is based on how 
privileges between the two 
groups vary, and which group 
is able to better identify with 
and assist underrepresented 
communities. 
The 
study 
concluded that white women 
are awarded a certain degree 
of 
“male” 
privilege, 
thus 
making them less capable 
of 
connecting 
with 
other 
communities simply because 
of their race and nationality. 
By focusing on which group 
of women has more privilege, 
the study does not properly 
demonstrate 
how 
we 
can 
overcome those differences 
and 
stand 
with 
other 
populations, regardless of the 
intersections of identity. 
Surely, 
there 
are 
many 
privileges that are beyond 
basic 
fundamental 
rights. 
For example, the privilege 
of 
being 
taken 
seriously 
in a conversation, of being 
screened in a job application 
because of gender or race 
and so on. These, among 
others, are the undeserved 
benefits of having certain life 
experiences, not entities that 
every subgroup is inherently 
guaranteed. We should be 
conscious of these privileges, 
and in turn, act upon them by 
recognizing how much space 
we take up and fostering 
a drive to eradicate unfair 
advantages. 
Beyond 
these, 
however, 
the 
distinction 
between unfair privileges and 
basic rights has been blurred 
to the point where advocacy is 
doing little to serve the most 
vulnerable. Hence, we need 
to use our privileges to create 
a world of more equitable 
rights.

Since 
their 
inception, 
the 
protests 
have 
become 
increasingly violent with as 
many as eight suicides linked 
to them. Additionally, 18-year-
old student protester Tsang 
Chi-kin was shot in the chest 
by a police officer at close 
range on the same day, further 
compounding the protesters’ 
fervor. 
The extradition bill that 
first sparked the protests was 
introduced in April 2019. It 
allowed for criminal suspects 
to be extradited to China under 
certain circumstances. Critics 
of the bill stated that it would 
expose residents of Hong Kong 
to unfair trials and potential 
violence at the hands of the 
Chinese government. Other 
criticisms include fears that 
China would further increase 
its influence over Hong Kong 
and potentially begin to target 
journalists. These hostilities 
towards the bill are what first 
led to the protests, which 
became much more pressing 
in June. The protests have 
become increasingly violent, 
with more instances of the 
Hong Kong police force firing 
tear gas at protesters and 
deploying water cannons. In 
return, 
protesters 
have 
lit 
fires and thrown petrol bombs 
and bricks. As of Sept. 30, 48 
people had been admitted for 
medical treatment as a result 
of protest violence. 
Despite the obvious chaos 
and violence characterizing 
these protests, the protesters 
involved 
have 
maintained 
their 
momentum. 
The 
extradition 
bill 
that 
prompted the initial protests 
was 
withdrawn 
in 
early 
September. Protesters remain 
steadfast with their other 
demands 
oriented 
toward 
broader 
democracy 
and 
greater suffrage, demanding 
an independent probe into 
force used by police, amnesty 
for 
arrested 
protesters, 
a 
halt 
to 
the 
categorization 
of 
the 
protests 
as 
riots 
and the implementation of 
universal suffrage. Many of 
the protesters, the majority 
of whom are young adults, 
have taken to social media to 
declare that the withdrawal of 
the extradition bill is simply 
not enough to bring an end to 
the protests. The chaos and 
violence have not deterred 
demonstrators 
from 
their 
cause. Instead, many have 
doubled down, refusing to 
give in to the pressures and 
tactics employed by mainland 
China. Most recently, this 
includes 
the 
widespread 
refusal to comply with an 
emergency law banning face 
masks during protests. During 
the Oct. 6 protests against this 
ban, almost all demonstrators 
covered their faces, chanting 
“Hong Kong, resist!” as they 
marched through the streets 
in clear defiance of the laws 
employed to control them. 
Along with the use of social 
media, these young activists 
have 
employed 
several 

nontraditional 
methods 
in 
constructing 
the 
protests. 
First of all, the movement 
is largely decentralized and 
without a clear leader. Earlier 
protests, such as the Umbrella 
Movement of 2014, were based 
on the concept of occupying 
essential areas of the city for 
several months. In contrast, 
the 
current 
protests 
have 
adopted the slogan of “Be 
Water.” Originally a reference 
to a quote by famous Hong Kong 
actor Bruce Lee, demonstrators 
have co-opted this saying as a 
call for agility and adaptability 
within 
the 
movement. 
As 
opposed to a fixed occupation, 
these 
protests 
are 
much 
more mobile. Marches often 
do not have a fixed route, 
rallies may abruptly turn to 
marches and small groups 
of protesters may break off 
from others and carry out 
smaller, targeted occupations 
of 
government 
buildings. 
Moreover, these protests are 
essentially leaderless. While 
this is partly because of the 
harsh 
prosecution 
of 
the 
leaders of past movements, the 
absence of a leader also allows 
more 
equal 
collaboration 
among protesters on internet 
forums. Those involved in the 
protest say this method allows 
more 
equal 
participation 
within the movement while 
also encouraging the type of 
participatory democracy that 
they are ultimately fighting 
for. 

Hong Kong has enjoyed a 
“one country, two systems” 
style of government for over 
two 
decades. 
This 
notion, 
indicating that Hong Kong 
is a part of China while 
maintaining its own political 
system, is essential to Hong 
Kong’s identity. As a Special 
Administrative Region, Hong 
Kong maintains a high degree 
of autonomy through its own 
independent legal structures 
and 
police 
force, 
while 
Beijing is merely responsible 
for the region’s diplomatic 
relations and national defense. 
This 
unique 
status 
grants 
Hongkongers an independence 
and freedom they hold dear, 
yet 
many 
have 
expressed 
concerns for the arrangement’s 
upcoming expiration in 2047. 
As this deadline approaches, 
China 
is 
continually 
encroaching on Hong Kong’s 
democracy. In the past few 
years, 
owners 
of 
banned 
bookstores have disappeared 
mysteriously and lawmakers 
have been disqualified from 

running in elections due to 
their support for Hong Kong 
independence. In 2014, the 
Umbrella Revolution emerged 
in response to a series of 
restrictive 
and 
reactionary 
electoral 
reforms 
proposed 
by the Chinese legislative. 
Even though the movement 
concluded without resolving 
any 
political 
disputes, 
it 
was a warning for China’s 
determination 
to 
suppress 
democratic 
voices 
and 
generated 
awareness 
for 
the 
importance 
of 
dissent 
in 
resisting 
authoritarian 
measures. 
The 
most 
well-
known 
leaders 
of 
the 
movement, 
Joshua 
Wang, 
Nathan Law and Alex Chow, 
were even nominated for the 
Nobel Peace Prize in 2018, 
to recognize their efforts to 
promote peace and freedom.
Similarly, 
the 
ongoing 
student-led protests, keeping 
in the spirit of the 2014 
Umbrella Movement, are also 
fighting for Hong Kong’s right 
to democracy and autonomy. 
As 
students 
with 
ample 
access to democracy, it is 
imperative that we take note 
of the determination of our 
counterparts in Hong Kong 
and fully participate in our 
own 
democratic 
processes. 
Such participation can include 
supporting the Hong Kong 
protests while also registering 
to vote in our own upcoming 
elections and creating systems 
to facilitate increased voter 
turnout.
Though the spirit of the 
protesters 
has 
remained 
fierce for the past few months, 
it is hard to say whether 
their struggle will yield the 
desired results. The failures 
of previous campaigns, the 
silence 
of 
Chinese 
state 
press and the indifference 
of international leaders may 
foretell a bleak future for 
the 
Hong 
Kong 
protests. 
However, this does not render 
the protesters’ attempts futile 
or reduce the significance 
of these movements. Rather, 
it conveys the importance 
of defiance in the face of 
oppression and makes the 
protesters 
more 
honorable 
in their endeavors to defend 
their 
own 
democracy. 
Protester Hazel Chan, 18, told 
the BBC that she was “not 
sure how many more chances 
we’ll get to fight for freedom,” 
and while she did not think 
their actions will have a huge 
impact on the government, she 
said she believes their actions 
are worthwhile in gaining 
international 
attention. 
As 
Hong Kong’s political tides 
gradually shift from liberal 
to 
authoritarian, 
these 
protests leave much room 
for contemplation about our 
own situation and the decay 
of democracy in the United 
States. 
Nevertheless, 
by 
standing with Hongkongers 
today, we are standing with all 
of those who were oppressed 
in history and, perhaps, even 
ourselves in the future.

FROM THE DAILY

In solidarity with Hong Kong
I

n the past five months, Hong Kong has been rocked by intense 
anti-government protests against the Communist Party of China’s 
encroachment on its sovereignty and democracy. These protests 
experienced their most extreme levels of violence thus far in the days 
surrounding the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party of China on 
Oct. 1. The initial impetus for the protests in their current form was the 
decision by Carrie Lam, chief executive of Hong Kong, to push forward 
a bill allowing for the extradition of fugitives to mainland China.

For countless women, there aren’t many 
things in everyday life scarier than walking 
home alone at night. Fear of the dark and 
the evil that lurks there is built into us from 
the moment we become conscious of what 
it really means to be a woman. “Night” is 
synonymous with violence, assault, crimes 
that go undetected, the menacing power of 
the uninhibited male gaze. We are constantly 
bombarded by news stories of horrific sexual 
violence, usually carried out during the 
night, simply because there are less people 
to witness it and less light to illuminate it. 
Perhaps the scariest thing of all, though, is 
that we’ve been taught to think that all of 
this is normal, that outside at night is simply 
not a place where we are welcome. We build 
our days around our commutes, making sure 
that we won’t have to walk home, alone, in 
the dark. 
Because this is the world we live in, there’s 
something profoundly and oddly inspiring 
about “A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,” 
Ana Lily Amirpour’s 2014 Persian-language 
vampire western film, whose nameless 
protagonist is a woman (Sheila Vand, “Argo”) 
who walks the night streets of the fictional 
and aptly-named Bad City not in fear, but in 
strength. Though she murders many, using 
her beauty to lure men closer to her only to 
take their lives with her poisonous fangs, I 
can’t help but admire her. She is, after all, 
the only person truly willing to defend the 
women she lives among. She patrols the 

streets like a police officer, looking out for 
violent altercations and later punishing the 
culprits. She stalks these men and makes 
them know how it feels to be a woman at 
night. She makes them afraid to hurt another 
woman again.
Women are afraid of men, men are afraid 
of women. Does this have to be the case? 
How do we possibly trust each other while 
carrying all of this fear? 
“A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night” hints 
at the possibility of transcending this mutual 
fear in order to achieve true intimacy. In the 
film’s best scene, the nameless vampire and 
a man she’s come to know (Arash Marandi, 
“Under the Shadow”) share a moment of real 
vulnerability. She lifts his head to expose 
his neck and he lets her, unaware of her true 
nature. She’s just about to sink her teeth 
into him until at last she decides to rest her 
head on his chest and listen to his heart beat 
instead. Rather than take his life, she spares 
it and listens to it beat inside of him with 
adoration. She is afraid of how much she 
likes him, amazed by how close she can be to 
someone without killing them. 
“A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night” 
doesn’t have the answers to my questions. 
I’m not sure anyone does. But it does bring 
our suspicions and our fears about our world 
and about each other closer to the surface, 
unearthing them from the recesses of our 
mind where we keep the thoughts we aren’t 
supposed to have but have nonetheless. It 
reminds us of just how much there is to be 
afraid of and just how hard it is to fully trust 
another person, whether we care to admit it 
or not.

‘Girl Walks Home Alone’
and our culture of fear

SAMMY SUSSMAN

As I entered the Arthur Miller Theater for the 
Department of Theatre & Drama’s production of “Sense 
and Sensibility,” I’ll admit that I was skeptical. Could a Jane 
Austen novel really be adapted for the stage? Could this 
reserved book from 1811 really be adapted into a modern 
theatrical work?
By the end of the second scene, however, the production 
had alleviated my fears. As the audience was seated, the 
cast walked onto the stage in various stages of partial dress. 
As they donned their formal dresses and tied their ties, the 
audience was treated to casual, conversational 19th-century 
British English. After this setting was established, it was 
just as quickly discarded — modern pop music blared from 
the speakers, and the cast danced around the stage. 
This juxtaposition was jarring at first, and I was laughing 
at the production (as opposed to with the production) at 
the beginning of this dance number. But once I suspended 
my disbelief and bought into this premise, the play was 
remarkably consistent in not venturing beyond it. Though 
it took a little while, I was soon fully entrenched in this 
historical British society full of contemporary humorous 
interjections.
Director Priscilla Lindsay’s successful juxtaposition 
between plot and humor was mirrored by the inherent 
juxtaposition between (what I assume to be) historically 
accurate costumes and jarringly modern sets; men in 
morning dress and women in fancy gowns sitting in front 
of empty window frames and wooden chairs on wheels. 
In perhaps my favorite moment of the whole show, a table 
covered in a white sheet, turned on its shorter side, became 
an upright bed in which characters slept.
Much of the humor in the show came from The Gossips, 
a group of actors that comment on the action on stage 
without taking part in it. This humor was physical at times 
and more sophisticated at others. I never thought I’d see 
humans acting as horses and dogs in the middle of a Jane 

Austen story, but somehow it succeeded. They managed to 
interject contemporary humor and a modern perspective 
throughout.
The central plot, on the other hand, was a little harder 
to stomach. While this adaptation did much to address 
some basic problems resulting in the transition from novel 
to stage, some shortcomings were still present, including 
the circuitous, flowery nature of speech and plot at the 
time, the relative passivity of the female characters and the 
shallowness of their relationships.
In the interest of full disclosure, I should admit that I 
was not particularly familiar with this novel before I saw 
the play. I’d imagine that the experience was quite different 
for those who knew what to expect. But as a relatively 
unsuspecting audience member, I found it hard, at times, to 
connect with the characters and their desires. 
Though the humor was incredibly entertaining, as were 
the beginning and closing portions of each act, I found 
myself wishing for a little more concision in some of the 
middle numbers. This is no fault of the cast — they did 
much to enliven this sections and give emotional gravitas 
to situations in which little textual emotion was to be found 
— but I think it was a clear, if relatively minor, flaw in the 
adaptation.
That being said, I couldn’t have been more impressed 
with the cast. Their British accents were more than 
convincing, as were their 19th century mannerisms. And 
though I wouldn’t think I’d be able to relate much to these 
seemingly antiquated figures, I found myself moved by 
their struggles and touched by their resolutions. Even as I 
was rooting for the female characters to have more agency 
in rejecting marriage as their only source of happiness, I 
was admittedly touched when they managed to find love in 
these relationships.
All in all, it was a funny, thought-provoking take on 
a historically dated story, an unexpectedly entertaining 
modernization of a seminal piece of British literature. And 
it was a testament to the talent of those in the Department 
of Theatre & Drama that they were able to take this 
adaptation and make it entertaining. 

A new take on ‘Sensibility’

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

“Big Mouth” is back and more cringe-inducing than 
ever. The raunchy Netflix cartoon series returns strong 
in its third season with its signature disgusting-yet-
heartwarming humor and charm.
Following a group of pubescent seventh graders, 
“Big Mouth” explores the inherent humiliation and 
horror of the American middle school. This season’s 
premiere picks up directly after the events of the show’s 
Valentine’s Day special with Andrew Glouberman 
(John Mulaney, “Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse”) 
returning to school after attacking one of his classmates 
because of a rejection from his ex-girlfriend, Missy 
(Jenny Slate, “Obvious Child). This embarrassing and 
surprisingly violent outburst has left Andrew an outcast 
at his school and, because of a viral video of the incident, 
a popular online livestreamer. 
As Andrew struggles to learn how to redeem himself, 
an accident in woodshop leaves him unintentionally 
maimed by another boy who lost focus staring at a 
female classmate’s revealing tank top. The girls are then 
issued a restrictive dress code to avoid “distracting” the 
boys any further. In protest, Jessi (Jessi Klein, “Inside 
Amy Schumer”) and the rest of Bridgeton Middle’s 
female students stage an impromptu “Slut Walk” with 
their most provocative clothing and demand the boys 
be held accountable for their actions, despite their 
teachers’s assertions that “boys are animals.” After a 
brief uniform policy is enforced, the girls win their right 
to dress however they want and teach the boys a lesson 
on self-control and toxic masculinity. 
While the episode ends on a victorious note, it’s 
worth noting a disturbing subplot that finds Andrew 
delving into the world of incels. As Andrew siphons his 
anger toward the girls at school into his online rants, 
he catches the attention of a “Men for Equality” group 
that invites him to one of their meetings. Upon arriving, 
Andrew finds the club is actually full of white male 
supremacists whose neo-Nazi views shock the Jewish 
teenager into fleeing from both the meeting and his own 
journey toward a similar mindset. Andrew confides in 
his best friend, Nick (Nick Kroll, “The Addams Family”) 
that “I don’t want to have hate in my heart” and begins 

making amends to his fellow students. Andrew and the 
other boys have learned, through a series of musical 
numbers and cartoon hijinks, that maybe the girls they 
go to school with don’t exist just to be stared at.
“Big Mouth” as a whole can be summed up in one 
line Jessi delivers in the premiere. When faced with the 
confusing standards women face and difficulties men 
have understanding that struggle, she says “I think it 
might just be this long conversation we all have to keep 
having!” This unfortunately frustrating sentiment 
voices the truth that, though there might not be an 
easy or right way to approach discourses on gender and 
sexuality, it’s worth trying your best. 
However admirable this message is, the Season 3 
premiere abandons the show’s more cynical elements 
and opts for a resolution so hopeful it feels almost 
ridiculous, and not in the fun kind of way the show 
usually excels in. While the harassment the girls receive 
from their teachers, parents and peers is as accurate as 
it is hard to watch, the storybook ending of Jessi and 
company securing a feminist victory in their community 
just isn’t how these situations usually play out. 

Because the show’s target audience is undoubtedly 
adults and not the age group depicted in the series, there 
feels like a disconnect between an honest portrayal of 
middle school life and storylines that will comfort 
their audience of more liberal young people. A group 
of seventh graders successfully rejecting extremism 
or sympathetically listening to each other’s feelings, at 
best, seems wildly optimistic and, at worst, pandering. 
“Big Mouth” may be looking at America’s future 
through rose-colored and X-rated glasses, but even 
with its idealistic opening, the show remains hilarious, 
insightful and beautifully crude. Here’s hoping the 
changes at Bridgeton Middle are felt in the real world 
too. For a dirty cartoon, it certainly knows how hard it 
is to grow up.

‘Big Mouth’ returns strong

ANYA SOLLER
For The Daily

NETFLIX
In the past 10 days, the NBA has become 
embroiled in a PR war with the Chinese 
government, video game developer Blizzard 
banned a player for showing solidarity with 
the people of Hong Kong and South Park was 
erased from existence within the digital walls 
of China. In an increasingly connected world of 
global entertainment, is it fair for consumers to 
judge companies for kowtowing to the demands 
of governments that they don’t support? How far 
should entertainment conglomerates go in order 
to get into the Chinese marketplace? Is there a 
line at which consumers and corporations alike 
should say enough is enough?
Most American citizens probably didn’t grow 
up thinking much about Hong Kong or the 
socio-political ramifications of its “one country 
— two systems” relationship with mainland 
China. I know I didn’t. It wasn’t something 
that was taught in school, it wasn’t a part of 
world history that was treated as significant 
for American students. The euro-centric view 
through which world politics and history are 
taught has been expounded upon to death in 
other places, so I won’t waste time re-hashing 
it here. What I will say is that even up to today 
I never thought much of the situation in Hong 
Kong besides “bad things are happening there” 
until a former co-worker of mine from summer 
camp posted on our old staff Facebook page. A 
Hong Kong native, he expressed his fear about 
what was happening in his country and reached 
out asking for prayers, help and a promise that 
we would help him raise awareness of what was 
happening. This column is my way of doing that. 
Over the weekend, Houston Rockets manager 
Daryl Morey tweeted an image that said “Fight 
for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.” Though 
the tweet was soon deleted, it has created an 
uproar in both China and the United States. 
Chinese broadcasters soon announced they 
would drop Rockets pre-season games from 
their channels, the NBA commissioner flip-
flopped back and forth over what to say in 
response, and a consensus of social outrage has 
emerged from Americans upset that one of their 
nations most popular sports leagues would bend 
to the whims of what is essentially a country 
in thrall to a dictator. Blizzard, the company 
behind games like “World of Warcraft,” 
banned a player for publicly supporting Hong 
Kong protestors and was met with a wave of 

#BoycotBlizzard pronouncements across the 
internet. South Park responded to being banned 
in China by continuing to mock the Chinese 
government. Which of these responses was the 
right one?
While many have come out against the NBA 
for attempting to protect their business interests 
in China over their employees’s right to free 
speech, few have batted an eye at the ways in 
which Disney and other media conglomerates 
have sought to appease the Chinese government 
and marketplace over the past few years. For 
years rumors have abounded that the reason 
why there hasn’t yet been an LGBTQ+ character 
introduced in a mainline Marvel or Star Wars 
movie is because Disney is afraid of how such a 
character would be perceived in China. This year 
the Chinese box office is expected to outstrip 
the USA as the largest film market in the world. 
Movies that bomb in America are now counting 
on making up that money overseas, particularly 
in China. But the Chinese government over 
the past two decades has slowly tightened 
the noose on freedom of expression, meaning 
that for domestic entertainment products to 
successfully export themselves they must also 
censor themselves in the process. This is a 
country that banned Winnie the Pooh because 
there were memes floating around of the 
President of the Communist Party that looked 
sorta like Winnie the Pooh. This is what the 
NBA is dealing with. Is it right to let a country 
that is violently putting down protests in Hong 
Kong every single weekend dictate the terms 
upon which American entertainment should be 
made?
Money drives everything in this country and 
has for a long time. To demand that Disney or 
the NBA or Blizzard not do business in China 
would accomplish almost nothing. Apple, Nike, 
Adidas and dozens of other countries also rely 
on the Chinese market for huge portions of 
their revenue. They aren’t just going to stop 
selling products in every country with policies 
Americans don’t agree with. But more can be 
done to prevent their own employees’ freedoms 
being rolled over in the process. The Rockets 
GM should be able to tweet his feelings about 
a totalitarian government that is actively 
harming its own citizens and he should not be 
punished for doing so. If we can’t protect that 
much, if we can’t protect our own freedoms of 
speech from countries and groups that would 
seek to silence us, then it doesn’t matter what 
happens politically in these fifty states because 
we’ll have already lost where it counts.

Whenever I bring up “Grey’s Anatomy” in conversation, the 
response is always cynical: “That show is still on?” But if people stopped 
dismissing the show simply because it’s in its 16th season, they would see 
the impressive and creative work that has emerged and persisted since 
Shonda Rhimes created the show in 2005. 
Although Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo, “Station 19”), Alex Karev 
(Justin Chambers, “Someone You Know”), Miranda Bailey (Chandra 
Wilson, “General Hospital”) and Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr., 
“The Conners”) are the only four characters from the pilot that are still 
on the show today, considering the current state of network television 
where 13 episode seasons are now the norm, “Grey’s” is still going strong. 
It boasts 25 episodes in its past season and is already renewed for a 17th 
season. 
Beginning in 2005, “Grey’s” aired as a mid-season replacement and 
was an immediate hit with the advertiser-coveted 18-49 demographics 
and led its closest competition by over seven million. Although ratings 
have been up and down throughout its run, there was a resurgence 
entering Season 12 — the show’s first without fan favorite, Derek Shepard 
(Patrick Dempsey, “Hudson & Rex”). This resurgence proved that 
faithful viewers, mostly women under 35, were not done with “Grey’s” 
yet.
“Grey’s” is a case study in how younger audiences’s discovery of a 
show through streaming platforms can ultimately revive its popularity. 
My experience was no different — I was far too young to watch the show 
when it first came out. An initial look at same-day ratings from Season 
12 show a decrease from prior years, but a quick examination of multi-
platform numbers which include DVR and streaming services show 
an increase in viewership. In Season 13, “Grey’s” was the highest-rated 
drama on television. 
For some people, this show has been apart of their routine for over a 
decade. There is familiarity that cannot be replicated. People may not 
be watching live television like they used to but they are still watching 
the programming, just at their convenience rather than the networks’s. I 
began watching “Grey’s” week-to-week in its 11th season when I was in 
high school and found it to be one of the only shows that can get me to do 
my laundry. I don’t need to give it my undivided attention, but I can still 
understand what is happening. 

From “Will & Grace,” “Roseanne” and “Norman Lear’s Live in 
Front of a Studio Audience,” revivals happen because people still want 
this familiarity. In the same way, “Grey’s” has that same sort of feeling 
without the leaving-and-coming-back part. So stop dismissing it as 
garbage — there is a reason, perhaps even more than a singular one, why 
ABC hasn’t hung up its scrubs quite yet.
With each new season, “Grey’s” has continually reinvented itself. The 
Season 15 finale found Chief Bailey firing Grey, Karev and Webber — the 
four remaining original cast members — and consequently opened up a 
whole new world of stories to tell in Season 16 and beyond. Karev has 
been hired to be Chief of Pac-North to turn around the worst hospital in 
Seattle, and takes Webber with him. 
So to those that question why “Grey’s” is still on the air, my best guess 
is that you haven’t taken the time to see the kind of show that it truly 
is. Not only has “Grey’s” broken the record for longest running medical 
drama, but it has outlived one spin-off and has a second one in its third 
season. In total, there is a universe that consists of 472 episodes worth 
of “Grey’s Anatomy.” Let that sink in. Committing to any new show is a 
daunting task, and that’s without taking into account the 20,768 minutes 
it would take for someone to watch every episode in the Grey’s Anatomy 
Universe. “Grey’s Anatomy” has survived a Writer’s Strike, casting 
changes and technological evolution. 344 episodes later, it is still only the 
beginning.

‘Grey’s Anatomy’ will never die

FILM NOTEBOOK

I hummed to Mitski long before I knew who 
she was. Puberty 2 fit my experience better than 
most clothes did following my personal Puberty 
1, but the album evaded my attention until I was 
19. I would’ve been brilliantly exposed had I still 
watched Cartoon Network’s “Adventure Time” 
as a high school junior — what an introduction 
it would’ve been, watching none other than 
Marceline the Vampire Queen serenade me with 
“Francis Forever.” Yet, “Your Best American Girl” 
somehow didn’t approach me until two years later, 
laying on my dorm room bed, fixated on the ceiling 
two feet above me and on my fleeting teenhood’s 
boundless spell of unrequited love. How fitting the 
timing was, the music soundtracking an era just as 
awkward. 
This wasn’t the case with Be the Cowboy. At the 
tail end of summer 2018, I felt my world rev up with 
potential as I sunk into a sense of comfort I hadn’t 
felt before, the fear and trepidation of not belonging 
slipping from my anxieties. I’d be a sophomore 
and an adjusted 20-year-old in a matter of time (or 
at least I convinced myself of the latter). I found 
my niche on campus and my passion. And Be the 
Cowboy explored love the way neither Mitski nor 
I had ever before. It’s personal but distant, builds 
over itself in manifold ways but slips away like 
a gasp. It coats over our existence in a seamless 
ether we reduce to experiences. And Be the Cowboy 
explores this in gestures both grand and minute.
This is felt from the introduction, with “Geyser” 
buzzing like a subdued cathedral organ. This 
continues into the first verse, scattered with 
twinkling piano keys that hum as Mitski croons 
“You’re my number one / You’re the one I want / And 
I’ve turned down / Every hand that has beckoned me 
to come.” She sings in abstracts, reducing love to an 
essence that simmers in the chorus as she proclaims 
“Though I’m a geyser / Feel it bubbling from below.” 
It aches and crescendos in an undeniable desire to 
an undisclosed love, one only conveyed by Mitski in 
interviews. “I will be whatever it needs me to be. I 
will do whatever it needs me to do in order for me to 
continue to be able to make music,” Mitski revealed 
in an interview with NPR. But that’s not obvious, 
it’s not even subtly present within the album. 
This is the magic of Be the Cowboy, where 
every subject is navigated through raw emotion 
and feeling. The lyrics are jumbled up in heady 
metaphors and abstractions that play over sheer, 
meticulous instruments that sparkle, crescendo and 
buzz at the very tinge of emotional intensity. It’s this 
vague potency that makes the songs applicable to 
any situation yet direct enough to pinpoint specific, 

unique ones for every individual. 
I tune in to this album frequently, but especially 
when I lose track of my motivation. For me at 
least, passion and a willingness to explore are 
reflections of what we love and how we uncover 
them. Be the Cowboy evokes these feelings in 
unwavering confidence and insight. It blurs out 
universal experiences under a wistful, omniscient 
lens that envelop feelings from a particular place 
of significance. “Pink in the Night” renders 
unrequited love as a person staring at someone 
else’s back, unraveling into the turmoil of longing 
for a past relationship one of the other parties has 
already moved on from. “Two Slow Dancers,” on the 
other hand, finds two lovers intertwined, revisiting 
the scent of a school gymnasium and their fleeting 
youth under the guide of elegant, plinking synths. 
There’s an insecurity to these feelings most artists 
fail to capture in their work, and rightfully so — 
it’s easy to come off as self-loathing and pathetic. 
However, it never feels this way with Mitski. Her 
loneliness, the companion to her overarching 
subject of love, pleads for company and latches 
onto interests that have long evaded Mitski’s life. 
But they never run trite, nor strive for sympathy. 
Rather, these songs connect with people to foster 
a sense of companionship, reassuring listeners of 
whatever plight they may experience. 
At 20, I can confidently say I’m no longer 
enraptured by the insecurities that defined my 
adolescence; my body feels comfortable to me and 
I no longer chase after interests that don’t “beckon 
me” the way music does for Mitski. Rather, I find 
my entanglements in the way I connect with 
what I love and what it means to me. I experience 
burnout often when I write, find it hard to strike up 
a conversation with the people I love on occasion 
or lose track of why I’m going into teaching. These 
predicaments cast the spell of loneliness I now 
know in these early moments of adulthood; it’s easy 
to allow them to cast you off as other or incapable 
of achieving what you desire. This is the thread 
that weaves Be the Cowboy as it dog-ears landmark 
experiences and feelings like moments in a worn-
out novel. Every statement, feeling and confession 
pours out seamlessly but under the guise of a sonic 
precision throughout this labyrinthine narrative of 
love. 
This is why Mitski’s Be the Cowboy succeeds; it 
encapsulates Mitski’s relationship with music in 
not only its progression from her previous effort 
but the capacity to communicate the tribulations 
Mitski endured to produce it. She highlights this in 
the absurdity of diffidence and the fruitless clinging 
to the past, how they fester into unsatisfactory 
stagnation. This album assures me of the transience 
of my problems, the capacity to love and survive in 
the never-ending desire to pursue the things I love.

Vince Carter is 42 years old and has been in the 
NBA mainstay since 1998. (For those of you keeping 
track at home, that’s 21 going on 22 seasons, an all-
time league record.) He’s an old man still making 
waves in a young man’s game. Carter has perfectly 
transitioned from his high-flying acrobatic style of 
play, defined by insane slam dunks, to a mentor and 
a sharpshooter. He’s 20th on the all-time scoring 
list, sixth on the all-time three-point field goals 
made list and fifth on the all-time games played list 
(1,477 games and still 
going!).
Here’s another fun 
fact: Danny Brown is 38 
years old and has only 
been in the rap scene 
since 2010, when he 
released his first solo 
album The Hybrid (for 
those of you keeping 
track at home, that’s a 
mere nine years. As a 
reference, 
Schoolboy 
Q, age 32 and Danny’s friend and collaborator, has 
been signed to TDE since 2009). He’s an old man 
who has only recently started making serious waves 
in today’s rap game. However, in that brief time, he’s 
released a critically-lauded and fan-adored mixtape 
XXX, a commercially and critically successful 
album Old and a critical darling and experimental 
strung-out rap masterpiece Atrocity Exhibition.
Somehow, Danny Brown continues to make some 
of the most inventive music of any mainstream artist 
today. He’s constantly changing aspects of his sound 
and selecting beats that would make other rappers 
wince. Yet, for some reason, he decided to go back 
to basics with his latest release uknowhatimsayin¿. 
That is, he’s going back to his basics.
On uknowhatimsayin¿, Danny Brown finds 
himself doing what he does best: rapping. Gone 
(mostly) is the yelp of a voice that he’s known for, 
and in its place is a new, low register growl. Gone 
too are the challenging, abstract Paul White beats 
that have defined Brown’s music for the past few 
years. Paul White is still around as Danny’s main 
producer, but he gets some help from the likes 
of Flying Lotus, Standing on the Corner and the 
legendary Q-Tip, who also serves as the album’s 
executive producer. He’s rapping for the sake of 

rapping, and that’s a beautiful thing because he’s 
damn good at it.
Danny comes out the gates swinging with 
“Change Up,” a murky track highlighted by pulsing 
drum breaks and multiple guitar licks. It would be 
a subdued song for a lot of rappers, but for him, it’s 
really subdued. It doesn’t matter though, because he 
still raps his ass off, spitting ominous, jarring things 
like, “They thought I was gone, back from the grave 
/ Mind of a master, blood of a slave” and “Lord, have 
mercy, pray for me / Need to calm down, so pass me 
weed / Got me stressed out, situation looking bleak 
/ Time’s runnin out, how’d my days turn to weeks?”

Despite 
the 
bleak 
opener, 

uknowhatimsayin¿ 
might be Danny Brown’s 
most vibrant sounding 
album yet. The beats are 
absolutely wild, the most 
prominent 
example 
being the JPEGMAFIA-
produced “3 Tearz.” The 
track is a modern take 
on boom-bap, defined by 
organ blasts, fat drums 
and strange bursts of abstract noise. The production 
throughout is a blast, to say the least.
Most importantly, Danny is having fun on this 
album, making it a joy to listen to, and at 33 minutes 
in length, it begs for repeat listens. His rapping is 
loose, but he’s always in control, never straying 
far from each beat’s pocket. uknowhatimsayin¿ is 
filled with little tidbits, including a quick shout out 
to Pat Benatar and a reference to Elvis Presley’s 
supposed death on the toilet. It’s the first album in 
his discography in which listeners don’t have to be 
worried about Danny’s well-being; he just sounds 
like he’s in good health and good spirits.
Despite his turn away from experimentalism, 
uknowhatimsayin¿ has cemented Danny Brown’s 
status as a legendary figure in hip hop. He’s 
making the music he wants to make, and he’s not 
compromising his artistic vision for the sake of 
commercial success. This album marks a new era 
in Danny’s life. He’s making music that accurately 
represents who he is, and he should. As he says in 
“Best Life,” “‘Cause ain’t no next life, so now I’m 
tryna live my best life / I’m livin’ my best life,” and 
uknowhatimsayin¿ is a good representation of that.

New faces buoy Wolverines past tough Detroit defense as Michigan takes 1-0 victory behind Derick Broche’s winner

As 
the 
minutes 
ticked 
further and further down in 
Wednesday 
night’s 
match, 
the 
Michigan 
men’s 
soccer 
team’s intensity was gradually 
building. After being knotted at 
zero with Detroit Mercy after 
nearly 75 minutes of action, the 
Wolverines were in desperate 
need of a big play to restore 
order on the pitch. 
That play came with 16 
minutes to go in the second 
half, as sophomore forward 
Derick Broche connected on a 
cross from freshman midfielder 
Harry Pithers to give Michigan 
(6-2-3 overall, 2-0-2 Big Ten) 
the lone goal en route to a 
1-0 win over the Titans (3-7-1 
overall, 0-2-1 Horizon League). 
Players 
exchanged 
chest 
bumps, and Broche was mobbed 
by his teammates in the corner 
of the field. For the Wolverines, 
who had struggled mightily 
throughout most of the match, 
Broche’s diving header came 
with an overwhelming sense of 
relief. 
“It 
was 
definitely 
frustrating,” 
Broche 
said. 
“They’re a drop back team, and 
to finally get that breakthrough, 
it gave us all the life back in the 
game. So, yeah, it was amazing 
for the team.” 
Michigan entered the game 
expecting to cruise to an easy 
victory, but its lackadaisical 
approach in the early going 
played right into the hands of 
the scrappy Titans. 
Throughout 
the 
game, 
Detroit 
Mercy 
gained 
a 
competitive edge by exerting its 
physicality and getting under 
the skin of the Wolverines. 
While 
Michigan 
dominated 
possession, the Titans managed 
to keep things close with their 
chippy play and stingy defense. 
They certainly succeeded in 
getting reactions out of the 
Wolverines as well, drawing 13 
fouls including a yellow card 
from junior midfielder Carlos 

Tellez.
In the early goings Michigan 
wasn’t 
matching 
Detroit 
Mercy’s 
intensity 
according 
to senior goalkeeper Andrew 
Verdi. He quickly became so 
fed up with the effort of the 
team that his exasperated voice 
could be heard throughout the 
stadium. 
“I saw that a lot of people 
maybe weren’t giving the energy 
in the game that they typically 
bring,” Verdi said. “So I was 
trying to lift that up. I think 
sometimes you’re gonna have to 
get on your teammates and try 
to get the best out of them. I’ll 
do as I expect somebody to do to 
me if I wasn’t playing the way I 
wanted to.”
While Verdi may have been 
disappointed with the effort at 
some points, the win did give 
him his fourth straight clean-
sheet. 
“It feels great,” Verdi said. 

“Four 
straight 
shutouts 
is 
something that’s pretty rare. 
I think me and the defense 
take great pride in that. It’s a 
reflection on the whole team.”
Michigan 
managed 
to 
keep its shut-out streak alive 
without two key starters, junior 
defender Joel Harrison and 
junior forward Umar Farouk 
Osman. Coach Chaka Daley 
decided to rest both ahead of 
Sunday’s match against No.4 
Indiana — though Harrison was 
forced to sub in for the final 
ten minutes due to an injury to 
senior defender Abdou Samake. 
In their stead, Pithers and 
fellow freshmen Carter Payne 
and Christian Pulselli saw a 
sharp increase in their playing 
time. 
“A lot of new faces in this kind 
of local derby type atmosphere 
or game, and I thought they 
stood up well and fought hard,” 
Daley said. “And we got a 

It was a slugfest.
At halftime of the Michigan 
men’s soccer team’s match against 
Detroit 
Mercy 
(3-7-1 
overall, 
0-2-1 Horizon), the Wolverines 
(6-2-3 overall, 2-0-2 Big Ten) had 
only registered one shot on goal 
in the scoreless tie. The Titans’ 
defense was suffocating Michigan, 
dropping almost everyone back to 
ensure they always had numbers 
on the defensive side. 
Normally, in situations like 
these, the Wolverines would look 
to their main playmakers for 
offense — All-American senior 
forward Jack Hallahan or graduate 
transfer forward Nebojsa Popovic, 
both of whom have started every 
match. 
Instead, the big play came 
from true freshman midfielder 
Harry Pithers. Facing pressure on 
the right sideline from a Detroit 

defender, he lobbed a masterfully 
placed cross to sophomore forward 
Derick Broche, who buried a 
header for the game’s lone goal. 
The assist was Pithers’ first point of 
his college career.
Still, Michigan’s 1-0 victory on 
Wednesday did not come easy, 
thanks to the Titans’ solid defense. 
Their conservative 
approach 
ceded 
time of possession 
to the Wolverines, 
but 
it 
allowed 
almost no space 
for their attackers 
to 
work 
with. 
Especially 
in 
the first half, the 
Detroit defenders 
filled the box and 
clogged up passing 
lanes, 
keeping 
Michigan from landing many 
quality shots and forcing offensive 
mistakes. 
“We 
made 
a 
few 
tactical 

mistakes,” said Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley. “ … Mistakes happen. 
We strive for perfection, but there’s 
always an error that can happen.” 
The Titans kept up their 
defensive 
approach 
early 
in 
the second half, holding the 
Wolverines to only one shot in the 
first 25 minutes of the half. Even 
Michigan’s usual 
stars 
struggled 
to make plays — 
Hallahan failed 
to register a shot 
in the second 
half before he 
was 
subbed 
out in the 66th 
minute. Detroit’s 
excellent 
defense 
also 
showed itself on 
corners, as the 
Wolverines failed to convert on any 
of their 10 corner opportunities. 
But as time ticked on, the talent 
gap became apparent, as Michigan 
managed to get behind the Titans’ 
back line, eventually culminating 
in Broche’s 74th-minute goal. 
“I think it was an early cross,” 
Broche said. “Most of the time 
early in the game, we took a little 
too long, and they got a chance to 
get players back, but this time we 
got a good cross early from Harry 
Pithers, and luckily I was at the end 
of it.” 
Though they only scored the one 
goal, the Wolverines’ offense was 
much more active late in the second 
half, tallying four shots in the final 
20 minutes of the match. This was 
partially due to Detroit adopting 
a more aggressive approach to 
try and even out the score, but 
Michigan’s 
passing 
was 
still 
visibly smoother and cleaner in the 
closing minutes. Pithers, Broche 
and junior midfielder Carlos Tellez 
— who has only started one match 
this season — were all central to 
the Wolverines’ attack late in the 
match. 
“We just needed a little bit of 
quality on service,” Daley said. 
“Because we were in the final third 
a lot in the second half.” 
A little bit of quality on service is 
exactly what Pithers delivered.

‘M’ set for tight series with Clarkson

Mel Pearson is quick to point 
out that when this weekend’s 
series was scheduled, no one knew 
what Michigan and Clarkson’s 
respective hockey teams would 
look like by the time the games 
were played.
So, the fact that the Wolverines’ 
home opener is against the No. 
11 team in the country isn’t 
intentional. 
But 
Pearson 
is 
embracing it as an opportunity to 
test what his team is made of right 
off the bat.
“It’s 
obviously 
a 
tough 
assignment for the first weekend, 
but a great opportunity for us, 
too,” Pearson said. “We’re at 
home. I like where our team’s at. 
We get to play a good opponent. 
It’s a good measuring stick. We’ll 
find where we are. Nobody’s going 
to win a national championship 
the first weekend or qualify to 
the tournament, but these are big 
games in the big scheme of things, 
especially down the road.”
The two programs come into 
the series in very different places. 
Clarkson went 26-11-2 last season, 
won the ECAC tournament and 
lost in overtime to Notre Dame 
in the first round of the NCAA 
Tournament. Michigan, on the 
other hand, entered last season 
ranked No. 4 in the country, and 
then proceeded to fall on its face 
and win just 13 games.
And after that disappointing 
finish 
last 
season, 
Pearson 
welcomes a chance to make a 
statement in the first weekend of 
the season. But it won’t be easy.
The Golden Knights return the 
vast majority of their scoring from 
last year, losing just two players 
who finished top 10 on the team in 
points. Their defense allowed the 
fourth-fewest goals in the nation, 
conceding just 78 goals on the 
season.
Kris Mayotte, who Michigan 
hired from Providence in the 
offseason, has some experience 
with Clarkson, as the two teams 
were 
frequent 
non-conference 

opponents. He knows what the 
Wolverines are in for.
“In my career, I’ve seen that 
school 
a 
lot,” 
Mayotte 
said 
Tuesday. “I know it’s always a 
big challenge. They are an older, 
structured type of team. I think 
that’ll be a great challenge for our 
guys and something that, as a staff 
and as a team, we’re excited for.”
Part of the challenge for 
Michigan will be maximizing 
its opportunities to score. The 
Golden Knights are known for 
their defense, and the Wolverines 
will need to take advantage of the 
chances they get — particularly on 
the power play.
Early in the year, when teams 
are still figuring out how to 
maximize their personnel, special 
teams can be a deciding factor. 
Last year, special teams was key 
for Michigan in a ranked non-
conference matchup with then-
No. 19 Western Michigan — the 
Wolverines won the Friday game, 
6-5, and went 3-of-7 on the power 
play while holding the Broncos to 
only one power-play goal in six 
opportunities.
This weekend, Pearson expects 
special teams to be no less 
important than it was then.
“We have to make sure that 
we’re disciplined,” Pearson said. 
“We have to make sure that we take 
advantage of the opportunities 
that are presented on the power 
play. We’re going to try to take it 
to them a little bit with our speed 
and aggressiveness. If we draw 
penalties, that’s great, but you 

have to make sure you can follow 
through and convert on the power 
plays.”
While Michigan and the Golden 
Knights have met only once before 
— in 2017, when the Wolverines 
won 3-0 on the road — two players 
bring an element of familiarity to 
the matchup.
Sophomore 
forward 
Nolan 
Moyle and Clarkson forward Josh 
Dunne spent two years on the same 
junior team, the USHL’s Green Bay 
Gamblers and even lived together 
during that time. In their second 
season, Dunne centered the line 
that Moyle played on all year. That 
season, Dunne finished second on 
the team with 48 points and Moyle 
finished third with 45.
Each is excited to see his friend, 
but it’s clear that the competition 
will be intense on the ice.
“It’s obviously going to be a little 
different seeing him in another 
color,” Moyle said. “But down 
there on the ice, he’s the opponent. 
Gotta work hard against him. Not 
going to take it easy.”
Added Dunne: “I’m always 
looking forward to seeing him, 
and we’re both competitive so 
we love the competition between 
each other. We’re both excited for 
this weekend.”
In Pearson’s view, playing 
against a friend always adds an 
extra level of competitive drive. 
And in this series, which both 
Pearson and Mayotte expect to be 
closely contested, that extra level 
of motivation may help Michigan 
come away with at least one win. 

For Dwumfour, this may be the start

After a win over Iowa, Michael 
Dwumfour texted his defensive 
coordinator.
“Coach, I jumped some gaps,” 
he said, according to Don Brown. 
“It won’t happen again.”
That’s just how Dwumfour 
is. The redshirt junior defensive 
tackle is always hungry for 
improvement, 
even 
after 
demolishing 
his 
opponent 
the way he did against the 
Hawkeyes, when he mauled 
Iowa’s vaunted offensive line 
in a game Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh called a “defensive 
masterpiece.”
Aiding his effort, Dwumfour 
has an impressive set of athletic 
abilities, especially for a 282-
pound defensive lineman. Brown 
doesn’t want to admit where 
he was when he saw a video of 
Dwumfour running a slant route, 
but he will admit his reaction: a 
little smile creeped across his 
face.
Still, after spending much of 
the spring dealing with a torn 
plantar fascia and then getting 
injured again one play into the 
season, it hasn’t all been easy for 
Dwumfour.
“It was tough,” Dwumfour 
said Tuesday night, a maize towel 
still draped around his neck from 

the practice he’s finally healthy 
enough to participate in. “ … But 
I’m back now, so I forgot about 
that.”
It had to have been frustrating 
for Dwumfour to sit on the 
sideline as the defensive line 
got pushed around in a loss at 
Wisconsin, with the Badgers 
picking on Michigan’s lack of 
size. Converted fullback Ben 
Mason, drastically undersized, 
was forced to start at three-
technique with Dwumfour out, 
and his inexperience there was 
on full display.
Harbaugh 
called 
out 
the 
entire defensive line in front of 
the team after that loss, telling 
them they had to play better. 
That 
unit 
has 
stepped 
up, 
with Dwumfour’s return the 
following week against Rutgers 
aiding that growth.
“Mike’s a great player,” said 
fifth-year 
senior 
offensive 
tackle Jon Runyan. “He’s really 
active with his hands, really 
quick twitch. Really hard to 
block in practice sometimes, 
that’s for sure. Seeing him back 
and healthy, I know he’s been 
struggling 
a 
lot, 
especially 
throughout the summer as well 
and going to the fall, it’s hard 
to see that guy sitting on the 
sidelines, sitting in the training 
room, battling through all these 
injuries he’s got, but I’m happy 

for him, that he’s back out there.”
Dwumfour especially excels 
in stopping the run game — a 
vital piece of the Wolverines’ 
game plan against Iowa. Now, 
the next step for Dwumfour is 
getting more involved in the 
passing game, highlighted by 
Brown’s explosive and tough-to-
master blitz packages.
With so much time missed, 
Dwumfour hasn’t been able to 
condition as much, but once 
he’s had a little more time back, 
Brown hopes to utilize him more 
in those looks and make the pass 
rush even more fearsome than it 
already is.
“The thing that Mike brings to 
the table is the ability to come out 
of his stance, 100 miles an hour,” 
Brown said. “… He’s athletic and 
again for him, he hasn’t played 
a whole heck of a lot of football 
lately around here. So now he’s 
going through another practice 
week, a chance to kind of sink 
your teeth into the game plan, 
sink your teeth into your stance, 
your footwork, your techniques, 
your fundamentals, your eyes, all 
those things.”
Dwumfour called it a blessing 
to be back on the field the past 
two weeks. But if his texts to 
Brown are any indication, he’s 
not taking any of it for granted — 
and in Brown’s eyes, it only goes 
up from here.

Preview: What to watch for as Michigan takes on Illinois this Saturday

As noon approaches Saturday 
afternoon, 
you’ll 
likely 
find 
yourself in front a TV.
You won’t quite know why, 
with Oklahoma-Texas just a few 
channels away, but you’ll be tuned 
into No. 16 Michigan’s trip to 
Illinois.
The Fighting Illini haven’t 
eclipsed .500 since 2007 and 
carry a three-game losing streak 
that began with a 34-31 indignity 
against Eastern Michigan nearly 
a month ago. Tickets for their 
season 
finale 
are 
currently 
going for $8 on StubHub, if you 
need a sense of the fanbase’s 
current enthusiasm. Their one 
ostensible hope at the beginning 
of the season, former Michigan 
quarterback Brandon Peters, is 
questionable with an upper-body 
injury.
And yet, football season is 
12 games, so you’ll be watching 
anyway, eager to see whether the 
Wolverines win by 20 or 30.
And when you do, you’ll want 
something to keep your interest 
after Michigan goes up multiple 
scores. The Daily breaks down 
what to watch for:
Michigan’s quarterback play
On the first play of Michigan’s 
third drive against Iowa last 
weekend, Shea Patterson dropped 
back and unleashed a deep bomb. 
Fifty-one yards downfield, Nico 
Collins beat his defender on a 
post route, catching the ball in 
stride and taking the Wolverines 
into the red zone for a second 
consecutive drive.
That was with 10:30 left in the 
first half. For the rest of the game, 
Patterson completed just 12 of 
20 passes for 94 yards, with no 
touchdowns and an interception.
The result was the worst passer 
rating of his Michigan career, 
continuing a season in which he’s 
down in nearly every statistical 
category — except interceptions. 
Then, Tuesday evening, Patterson 
came out and said he’s content 
with his play and that the 

Wolverines’ offense — averaging 
7.2 fewer points per game than 
last season — is “right where we 
want to be,” citing discrepancies 
between the practice and game 
products.
Saturday 
against 
Illinois, 
Michigan will have its next 
opportunity to translate that 
product.
There’s a limit, of course, to 
how much the Wolverines can 
show against a team that ranks 
98th in passing yards per attempt 
allowed. Two weeks ago against 
Rutgers, Patterson had his best 
game of the season, seemingly 
turning a corner before struggling 
against Iowa.
Still, 
Saturday 
is 
another 
chance to show his ability to 
perform in Josh Gattis’ offense 
and build momentum going into 
next week’s trip to No. 10 Penn 
State.
The 
running 
game’s 
effectiveness
Early in Michigan’s win over 
Iowa, the Wolverines’ offense 
found consistent success thanks 
to a healthy run game. When 
freshman running back Zach 
Charbonnet punched into the end 
zone to give Michigan a 10-0 lead, 
he had five carries for 27 yards 
and looked good doing it.
Pregame talk over an even 
carry split between Charbonnet, 
sophomore Hassan Haskins and 
sophomore Christian Turner had 
dissolved into Charbonnet’s day 
and it was working.
Three hours later, a look down 
at the stat sheet revealed the 
Wolverines had just 3.6 yards 
per carry. The scariest part is 
that’s their highest average since 
finishing with 5.2 in the season 
opener against Middle Tennessee 
State. Michigan’s yards per carry 
in the four games since: 2.4, 2.1, 
3.4, 3.6.
“I feel like in the run game, 
explosive plays just come down to 
hand placement,” said fifth-year 
senior left tackle Jon Runyan. 
“Whether it’s by a guard keeping 
his block or myself or (right tackle 
Jalen Mayfield) keeping our head 

inside the defender or where best 
we can find a seam.”
Against Illinois, the Wolverines 
won’t need an efficient ground 
game to stroll to an easy win. But 
this is their last chance before 
back-to-back games against Penn 
State and No. 9 Notre Dame to 
show they can be productive on 
the ground and make life a little 
easier for Patterson.
How Michigan’s run defense 
holds up against Reggie Corbin
On the other side, Illinois has 
had no such struggles with its 
yards per carry. One of its few 
bright spots over the past two 
seasons has been fifth-year senior 
running back Reggie Corbin.
In his first year as the Illini’s 
starting running back a year ago, 
Corbin burst onto the scene with 
an incredible 8.5 yards per carry 
in a nine-touchdown season. He 
hasn’t quite reached those levels 

this season, but still has 6.6 yards 
per carry and two 130-yard games.
Last weekend, when Michigan 
held Iowa to one yard on 30 
carries (66 yards excluding sacks), 
it was hailed as a bounce-back 
performance for a unit that was 
heavily criticized after giving up 
359 rushing yards to Wisconsin 
in a 35-14 loss. The difference, 
though, is Iowa — despite running 
a similar offense to the Badgers’ — 
doesn’t have a running back like 
Jonathan Taylor.
That’s not to say Corbin is 
Taylor — no one in the Big Ten is. 
But with redshirt junior defensive 
tackle Michael Dwumfour in his 
second game back from injury, 
this is a prime opportunity for 
Michigan’s run defense to show 
that its improvement is real.
Can Dax Hill continue strong 
performances?
Through three games, Daxton 

Hill — Michigan’s prized five-
star freshman safety — was 
conspicuously absent from the 
Wolverines’ secondary.
Two 
weeks 
ago, 
against 
Rutgers, an injury to junior 
J’Marick Woods gave Hill his 
first shot at significant playing 
time. He remained behind senior 
Josh Metellus and junior Brad 
Hawkins at safety, but the injury 
allowed Hill to slot in when either 
needed a play off.
Now, Hill has moved to the 
top of the depth chart at nickel, 
according to Jim Harbaugh.
Against Iowa, he played the role 
well beyond a typical freshman’s 
capabilities, notably breaking up 
a fourth-down pass attempt on a 
crossing route as the Hawkeyes 
drove into Michigan territory late 
in the second half with a chance 
to tie.
“He had six tackles, he showed 

up on the statline and taking 
steps, taking strides like everyone 
expected him to,” Harbaugh said. 
“I think it’s been a very good 
progression, seeing improvement 
from him each week.”
With Woods now in his second 
week back from injury, continued 
strong performances from Hill 
would likely indicate he’s moved 
into third on the safety depth 
chart in addition to his top spot at 
nickel.
Score prediction
Despite 
Michigan’s 
recent 
offensive struggles, it’s hard to see 
the Wolverines losing to a team 
that’s lost three straight games to 
unranked opposition. Michigan 
will be good enough on both sides 
of the ball to avoid raising any 
eyebrows while also failing to 
placate any of the chief concerns 
looming over this team.
Michigan, 34-14

How the ‘M’ defense bounced back

Two-and-a-half weeks ago, 
Josh Metellus sat expressionless 
behind a podium in Madison.
The 
senior 
safety 
had 
just played four of the most 
embarrassing quarters of his 
career, helpless as Wisconsin 
beat up Michigan for 35 points 
and 359 yards on the ground. A 
defense that had faced another 
round of losing its best talent 
to the NFL was seemingly at its 
breaking point.
“I think we pride ourselves on 
being the best defense in college 
football,” Metellus said that day. 
“And these last couple weeks, we 
haven’t shown that.”
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh knew as much. In 
the days after that game, with 
the whole team watching and 
the whole room still feeling the 
sting of the loss, he called out 
the defensive line — the group 
the Badgers physically exposed. 
Harbaugh 
wasn’t 
angry, 
at least not outwardly. The 
message was simple: Step it up.
“He just challenged us as 
football players, as competitors,” 
said redshirt junior defensive 
tackle Michael Dwumfour. “Just 
challenged us in a great way.”
To 
get 
called 
out 
as 
a 
competitor by Harbaugh, a man 
who often views everything 
as a competition, is no small 
deal. This, remember, is a coach 
who tried to beat his players in 
running up a nearby hill at San 
Diego. He’s someone who, upon 
arriving at Michigan, instituted 
competition into every nook 
and cranny of the program 
— four-hour practices and a 
“submarine” during fall camp, 
practically cutting off contact 
with the outside world.
For any issues you could point 
to with Harbaugh, it’s hard to 
believe any of his teams ever 
struggled to fight. Certainly not 
at Michigan. Unsurprisingly, 
these issues didn’t last.
In 
the 
run-up 
to 
that 
Wisconsin game, Brown talked 
about the relief of playing a 
more conventional team after 
facing Army’s triple-option and 

a 10-personnel-heavy Middle 
Tennessee. At the time, it came 
off as brash confidence. And in 
the wake of the loss, it seemed 
like that confidence was fleeting.
Now, after two more games 
against relatively conventional 
opponents, 
with 
Brown’s 
defense ranked second in SP+, it 
seems he simply jumped the gun 
by a week or so.
Brown has been coaching 
football since 1977, and he’s 
spent most of that time as a 
defensive coordinator. He has a 
routine down to a science.
He starts preparing for a 
given team about two weeks in 
advance. He doesn’t like focusing 
on one team before he’s played 
another, but it’s a necessity of his 
job. As part of that, he spends a 
chunk of Sundays and Mondays 
drawing out about 250 practice 
cards for the scout team — by 
hand. It helps him learn the 
opposing scheme and how to 
beat it. “Nobody else draws,” 
Brown said. “... It’s a quirk.”
It’s a safe assumption to say 
the disparity between cards 
detailing Wisconsin’s, Rutgers’ 
and Iowa’s offenses were next 
to nothing compared to what 
Michigan dealt with for its first 
three opponents. And it doesn’t 
hurt that the defensive line 
— in particular, Dwumfour — 
has gotten healthier and more 
confident.
A group that got pushed off 
the ball every time the Badgers 
handed it off turned Iowa 
quarterback Nate Stanley into 
a speed bag, peppering him to 
the tune of eight sacks. The 

Hawkeyes finished Saturday’s 
game with a single rushing 
yard. Defensive ends Aidan 
Hutchinson and Kwity Paye, 
tasked with the impossible job 
of replacing Chase Winovich 
and Rashan Gary, look like stars 
in the making.
“He is unbelievable,” Brown 
said of Hutchinson.
As for Paye?
“He is the best spread run 
defender I’ve ever seen.
“Why do I say that? Cause 
you can’t fool him. Zone read, 
close out the zone, chase the 
quarterback from the inside out. 
Check mark. 
“Bluff? 
Now, 
that 
puller 
comes back and instead of 
him trying to kick you out, he 
bypasses you. Breaks go on, 
chase the quarterback from the 
inside out. Check mark. He can 
do all those things like that. It’s 
uncanny.”
It’s one thing for Michigan 
to perform at a high level. It’s 
entirely another to do it against 
Iowa, and another still to do it 
in the way the Wolverines did. 
Dominating the entire game 
so clearly that a coach who, 
two weeks earlier, called out 
the line’s competitiveness in 
front of the team, decided to go 
conservative with the offense 
late so the defense could win it 
the game.
That 
doesn’t 
mean 
there 
aren’t still questions to answer 
and better competition coming. 
But for now, Michigan is right 
back where it wants to be.
One of the best defenses in 
college football.

Joe Milton waiting for his chance

Joe Milton wore a band on his 
wrist when he faced the media 
after the 2018 Spring Game — 
the 6-foot-5 quarterback peering 
down on a semicircle of reporters 
gathered nearby. 
“Just be you,” the wristband 
read. It complemented regular 
reminders in his phone connoting 
the same message.
“I’m 
just 
being 
me,” 
he 
explained. “That’s why I have these 
wristbands. I’m just being me, 
regardless. Competition, as well. 
We all just compete. Having fun.”
The life of a backup quarterback 
demands 
that 
kind 
of 
self-
reflection, coupled with a steadfast 
belief 
that 
one 
well-timed 
opportunity could change the 
course of your career.
Joe Milton’s chance is as close 
as it’s ever been these days, having 
meandered his way up the depth 
chart by equal parts fortune and 
persistence. Redshirt sophomore 
Dylan McCaffery has yet to return 
from 
his 
concussion 
suffered 
against Wisconsin, and as such, 
Milton has inherited more reps, 
both in practice and game. He 
completed three of four passes in 
an appearance against Rutgers, 
tallying 59 passing yards and two 
total touchdowns (one rushing). A 
brief stint, sure, but an undeniably 
encouraging one.
“It felt great, you know, just 
getting the opportunity to show 
what I have and show what I can 
do for the team,” he said Tuesday. 
“It just felt great.”
Milton’s 
merits 
are 
visibly 
obvious — an NFL frame, an arm 
capable of chucking the football 85 
yards, enough mobility to trouble 
defenses. He contemplated taking 
up baseball in the past and believes 
he could step onto a mound and 
throw 93 miles per hour on the 
dot. His receivers in high school, 
left with dislocated fingers, surely 
wouldn’t question it. The raw 
talent has always been there. It’s 
what made him a consensus top-10 
quarterback in the 2018 recruiting 
class.
Still, the shortcomings in his 
arsenal have always been just 
as evident. Milton has never 

completed more than 50 percent of 
his passes in a single season, dating 
back to his freshman year of high 
school. His 35-to-19 touchdown-
to-interception ratio in high school, 
while far from disastrous, falls well 
short of the requisite production 
for a top-flight recruit. 
There were never any illusions 
that he would be a guy who could 
produce right away. As such, his 
development 
has 
taken 
place 
largely away from the public eye, 
confined inside the insulated walls 
of Schembechler Hall. What is said 
publicly, then, must be taken at 
face-value.
For now, whether by sincerity or 
necessity, the reviews are positive.
“He’s worked on (accuracy),” 
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said 
two weeks ago. “There’s different 
ball flights, different appropriate 
throws. Not everything is a line 
drive fastball. There’s gotta be a lot 
of elevation ... to make a catchable 
ball for a runner. Joe’s responded 
and is really working on it. It’s not 
an easy thing to do.”
Milton 
believes 
all 
that’s 
standing in his way is opportunity. 
He came to school keenly aware 
of the need to improve accuracy, a 
process he deemed “pretty hard” 
due to his natural arm strength, but 
one he’s worked tirelessly at. 
When he came to campus, 
Harbaugh 
told 
him 
to 
stop 
watching the ball and keep his 
focus on the receivers. That, he 
says, has guided his maturation as 
a passer rather than a thrower, a 
crucial distinction any quarterback 
can elucidate.
“I noticed that (I’d improved my 
touch) when my coaches started 
getting fired up,” Milton said. 
“They started jumping when I put 

the ball out there. That’s how I 
know I improve. I know for myself 
when I got better, then the ball just 
dropped. I kind of just stopped 
looking at the ball in the air so that 
I know when it’s going to land or 
when it’s not going to land.”
Added Harbaugh, who has 
seen 
dozens 
of 
quarterbacks 
develop in his time: “We can all 
think of quarterbacks throughout 
the history of football that never 
did be able to get, to understand 
throwing with touch or throwing 
with the fastball when needed 
the appropriate throw for the 
appropriate 
down. 
But 
he’s 
working really hard at it, and it’s 
coming along really well. Definitely 
has a lot of arm talent. 
“It’s really important to him, 
which is a must.”
Milton’s 
true 
moment 
of 
reckoning will likely arrive in the 
spring and fall camp to come, when 
the starting job will re-open with 
senior Shea Patterson gone and 
Harbaugh will inevitably declare 
open competition.
Soon 
thereafter, 
a 
true 
meritocracy will yield a verdict — 
and, ultimately, deduce whether 
this developmental project was 
successful.
When asked in the spring what 
needed improvement, Milton said, 
“moving my feet quicker and just 
thinking faster.” Both issues, he 
posited, that would be hammered 
out with increased reps. He 
believes that’s now happened, that 
he’s ready if called upon.
“Everything else is fine,” Milton 
said. “That’s pretty much what I 
need to improve is my touch. I got 
that done, now I’m just executing 
plays.”
Executing plays. And waiting.
