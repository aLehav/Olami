Alumni call for 
separation from 
Stephen M. Ross

Stephen M. Ross, the New 
York-based real estate mogul 
who is the largest donor in 
University of Michigan history 
and namesake of the School of 
Business, has faced backlash from 
University alumni and on social 
media following his decision to 
host a reelection fundraiser for 
President Donald Trump in his 
Southampton home.
Following reports of Ross’s 
scheduled fundraiser — with 
tickets ranging from $100,000 
to $250,000 — he was trending 
on Twitter, with many calling 
for the boycott of SoulCycle 
and Equinox, two luxury gym 
companies owned by Ross.
Ross, whose net worth is 
estimated at about $7.7 billion, 
also owns football team the 
Miami Dolphins. In a statement to 
the Miami Herald, Ross defended 
his fundraiser, explaining he 
and Trump agree on some issues 
but “strongly disagree on many 

others.”
“I started my business with 
nothing and a reason for my 
engagement with our leaders is 
my deep concern for creating 
jobs and growing our company’s 
economy,” Ross wrote. “I have 
been, 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
be, 
an 
outspoken 
champion 
of 
racial 
equality, 
inclusion, 
diversity, public education and 
environmental sustainability.”
SoulCycle and Equinox also 
released statements affirming 
their commitment to diversity 
and tolerance. Both companies 
emphasized they do not endorse 
the event and said Ross is a 
passive investor uninvolved in 
management. 
However, 
some 
on 
social 
media 
continued 
to 
cancel 
membership 
to 
the 
two 
businesses and still condemned 
Ross’ support of Trump, citing 
the president’s rhetoric as racist, 
misogynistic and homophobic. 
Among Ross’ critics are former 
Hillary Clinton advisor Phillippe 
Reines, model Chrissy Teigen, 
actor Sophia Bush and actor Billy 
Eichner. 
In particular, Miami Dolphins 
receiver Kenny Stills suggested 
Ross’ support for Trump is 
contradictory to the mission 
statement 
of 
RISE, 
a 
non-
profit 
Ross 
founded 
aiming 
to “educate and empower the 

sports community to eliminate 
racial discrimination, champion 
social justice and improve race 
relations.”
University 
community 
members have also shared their 
concerns about the fundraiser 
to the Ross School of Business, 
prompting Dean Scott DeRue to 
send an email to students, faculty 
and staff in response. DeRue 
said the school does not endorse 
or support this fundraiser or 
any others for any political 
candidates.
The email emphasized the 
school’s 
values 
of 
diversity 
and inclusion as well as civic 
responsibility. 
In 
upholding 
these values, DeRue wrote the 
importance of listening to and 
working with people holding 
different opinions is key to the 
democratic process. 
“I want to close by saying that 
we, as an educational institution 
built 
on 
these 
core 
values, 
reject all attempts to divide 
our community,” DeRue wrote. 
“We are strong because of our 
diversity, and hate has no place in 
our society. At Michigan Ross, we 
rise above hateful rhetoric and 
live the values we aspire to. It is 
the Michigan way, and it is the 
way we will create a better world, 
together.”

City sees rise 
in absentee 
ballots cast

Clerk anticipates 
more absentee ballots in 
future due to passing of 
Proposal 3

Ann Arbor experienced a 22 percent 
increase in absentee voting during 
the Aug. 6 election, data from the city 
shows. Deputy City Clerk Steve Gerhart 
said his office did not experience a 
major influx of activity, despite the the 
increase in voting through alternative 
routes.
In November 2018, Michigan passed 
Proposal 3, which allows all eligible 
voters to cast an absentee ballot 
without explicit justification. Nearly a 
year since its passage, Ann Arbor has 
already begun to see its effects.
Prior to the proposal’s passage, 
absentee voting was limited to those 
over 60, those unable to get to the 
polls because they were out of town or 
prohibited by religious circumstance, 
those awaiting arraignment or trial, 
those who could not vote without 
assistance and those who were working 
to coordinate the election outside their 
precinct. The Aug. 6 election was the 
first sense the passing of Proposal 3.
Gerhart attributed the increased 
absentee voting to registration done 
online or over the course of months 
leading up to the actual election. All 
Ann Arbor registered voters are able to 
request an absentee ballot from the city 
clerk’s office beginning 75 days prior to 
any election and extending until the 
Monday prior. Voters need not fill out 
a formal request. Ann Arbor absentee 
ballots can be requested in person, over 
the phone or by email.
When 
retrieving 
absentee 
ballots from the city clerk’s office, 
recipients are subject to the same 
voter identification laws as all other 
Michiganders. Applicants presenting 
requests within 14 days of the election 
will be required to show proof of 
residency.

Admissions staff 
talks review process

Kedra Ishop, 
Erica Sanders 
discuss applications, 
incoming class

Following 
heightened 
interest 
in the college admissions process 
nationwide, The Daily sat down with 
University of Michigan admissions 
officials to discuss the various 
pieces of the University’s process. 
The following interview with Erica 
Sanders, director of undergraduate 
admissions, and Kedra Ishop, vice 
provost for enrollment management, 
has been edited for length and clarity.
The Michigan Daily: In light 
of the Varsity Blues scandal, there 
has been heightened attention on 
the college admissions process 
nationally. We would like to ask a 
few questions to clarify some of the 
lesser-known pieces of the process 
at the University. Please explain 
what happens to an application on 
the University’s end from the time 
the applicant presses submit to late 
August, when the incoming class 
arrives on campus.
Erica 
Sanders: 
Once 
the 
students submit the application, 
we 
receive 
the 
application 
electronically. And the student 
then receives reminders to submit 
all the required documents: so 
the transcript, official submission 

of test scores (and) we require a 
teacher and a counselor letter of 
recommendation. And then once 
those documents are received, 
then we will start the evaluation 
process.
So first, we process the app 
and then it goes on to evaluation 
process, all of our applications are 
evaluated at least twice. And within 
that process, the first evaluation 
is done randomly, we have about 
100 external staff members that go 
through between 25 and 50 hours of 
training yearly, depending on how 
many years they’ve read for the 
office in the past and what has been 
the pattern of their read both speed 
and accuracy so that we’re able 
to ensure that everyone basically 
has the same level of competency 
with evaluation as they’re reading 
files. Once that initial read is done, 
they are assigned randomly — so 
they don’t read for any particular 
territory or volume of application, 
so that there isn’t a bias towards, 
‘Oh I want all of my students to read 
it at x level,’ they’re read randomly.
The second evaluation is done 
based upon a territory management 
system, and so our staff basically 
are split into in-state, out-of-state 
and international territories that 
they become far more familiar 
with. So they have more expertise 
in regards to this whole system, 
the grading system and curriculum 
choices that students may have 
available.

City Council enters 
closed session after 
resident questions 
pedestian safety

A special session of Ann 
Arbor City Council took place 
this Monday in regard of two 
court cases: Attorney General 
et al. v. Gelman Sciences, Inc., 
relating to the dioxane plume 
caused by Gelman Science, and 
Think Right Strategies v. City 
of Ann Arbor, which involves a 
conservative political consulting 
firm suing the city over anti-
discrimination laws.
The meeting started with 
public commentary from Chuck 
Lockes, a member of the citizen-
run group A2 Safe Transport, 
which 
aims 
to 
improve 
pedestrian and transportation 
safety within the city. Lockes 
spoke about the statistical report 

he 
generated 
on 
pedestrian 
crashes in Ann Arbor from 2004 
to 2016. He said he emailed the 
report to all councilmembers 
and only got a response from 
Chip Smith, D-5, whom Lockes 
said responded negatively to the 
report. 
Lockes urged the council to 
properly address the issue of 
endangering pedestrians.
“Mr. Smith said he wanted 
to promote or get away from 
certain car cultures,” Lockes 
said. “I want to know, from him, 
if that means it’s okay for the 
city of Ann Arbor to accept a few 
extra casualties along the way. 
That seems to be the insinuation 
of what he is saying, from that 
logic.”
The 
council 
then 
went 
into closed session under the 
Michigan Open Meetings Act 
for pending litigation set forth 
or 
incorporated 
in 
MCLA 
15.268(E).

After 14 weeks of work-
ing on various projects, 
students 
in 
the 
2019 
Information and Technol-
ogy Services Internship 
Cohort lined the Michigan 
League with posters at the 
ITS Internship Showcase 
on Friday. The showcase 
featured a poster session, a 
student panel and closing 
remarks from Ravi Pendse, 
vice president for informa-
tion technology and chief 
information officer. 
This year, the Intern-
ship Cohort was com-
prised of 47 university 
and high school students. 
While many were from the 
University of Michigan, 
there were also students 
from University of South-
ern California, Michigan 
State University and sur-
rounding Ann Arbor high 
schools. 
DePriest 
Dockins, 
co-chairman of the ITS 
Internship planning com-
mittee, stated there was 

a jump in the number of 
applicants this year. 
“We went from about 
130 the previous year to 
320 this year,” Dockins 
said. “We were aston-
ished.”
According to Dockins, 
many students selected 
stood out in enthusiasm 
and ability to grow. Dock-
ins stated many of the 
candidates come in with 
little to no hands-on expe-
rience, so the program 
administrators hope the 
ITS Internship provides 
interns with the perfect 
complement to their strong 
academic background.
Diane 
Jones, 
execu-
tive director of operations 
in ITS, serves as a spon-
sor for the program and 
worked with the planning 
committee to expand and 
improve 
the 
program. 
This year, Jones explained 
they integrated the Wol-
verine Pathways Program 
to introduce high school 
students to technology-
oriented fields. The Wol-
verine Pathways Program 
is a free local program 

that helps seventh through 
12th grade students pre-
pare for college. 
“We’re 
hugely 
proud 
that we’re able to contrib-
ute to that and bring stu-
dents from surrounding 
areas,” Jones said. “The 
Wolverine Pathway Pro-
gram is so important to 
helping students under-
stand how to manage life.”
Tamariah Davis is a 
senior at Ypsilanti Com-
munity High School and 
was a participant of the 
Wolverine Pathway Pro-
gram. She said she learned 
how to use adobe, man-
age responsibilities and 
become more self confi-
dent.
“I’m 
very 
undecided 
about what I want to do in 
life,” Davis said. “I want to 
be a nurse, I want to be in 
ITS, I want to be a teach-
er, I want to be so many 
things … This helped me 
narrow down what I want-
ed to do.”
Michigan 
State 
Uni-
versity senior Raisa Mor-
rison worked on creating 
the ITS Intern Portal to 

improve 
and 
centralize 
intern communication. As 
an English major, she said 
she was able to apply what 
she learned in classes to 
being the project manager 
for her group.
“Being nontechnical, I 
was really nervous,” Mor-
rison said. “But they create 
a lot of space for technical 
and 
non-technical 
stu-
dents.”
LSA senior Joseph Lisi, 
on the other hand, was 
exposed to many different 
experiences that improved 
his technical skills. He 
worked on a project about 
significant incident auto-
mation to improve the 
coordination and respon-
siveness to various infor-
mation 
and 
technology 
issues.
“I was able to take a 
professional business pro-
cess and learn about it and 
learn how to improve it,” 
Lisi said. “It’s not really 
stuff you can learn in 
school.”

Visitors to Ann Arbor City 
Hall last Monday were greet-
ed by a new front desk staffed 
by an unarmed, private secu-
rity guard, where they will 
now need to check in to gain 
access to the third through 
sixth floors. Two days later, 
the University of Michigan 
began installing door locks to 
all classrooms and class labs 
in Mason Hall — the site of a 
false active shooter scare last 
semester — as part of a pilot 
project to enhance security 
and emergency preparedness 
campuswide.
Though planned for ahead 
of time, both projects were 
coincidentally implemented 
the week after a string of 
mass shootings — two less 
than 24 hours apart in El 
Paso, Texas, and Dayton, 
Ohio, and one earlier in the 
week in Gilroy, Calif. — in 
which more than 32 people 
were killed. 
According to the Gun Vio-
lence Archive, as of August 
5 there have been 255 mass 
shootings 
in 
the 
United 
States this year — a rate of 
more than one per day. Soon 
after, the governments of 
Venezuela and Uruguay and 
Amnesty International all 
released travel advisories, 
warning those visiting the 
U.S. of the high levels of gun 
violence.
In 
response 
to 
these 
national trends, institutions 
in Ann Arbor are also taking 
precautions. Though inde-
pendent of one another, the 
two back-to-back projects 
share a common purpose: 
to protect people frequent-
ing the buildings from vio-
lent threats and emergencies 
as mass shootings become 

deadlier nationwide. 
University door-lock proj-
ect
The door-lock project is 
being led by the Division of 
Public Safety and Security. 
Working with a team from 
the University’s Architec-
ture, Engineering and Con-
struction 
division, 
DPSS 
plans to finish the locks by 
the end of August so the 
classrooms can still be used 
in the fall. 
According to a Univer-
sity press release, the pilot 
project will guide University 
administration in exploring 
the scope and process of 
installing door locks to class-
rooms campuswide. DPSS 
Executive Director Eddie L. 
Washington Jr. noted Mason 
Hall was chosen as the first 
location due to its proximity 
to the Diag.
“The safety of students, fac-
ulty, staff and visitors is our top 
priority,” Washington Jr. said. 
“This project is part of our 
broader efforts to continuously 
identify technology, enhance 
alerting and implement train-
ing to ensure the safety and 
security of our community.”
In an email to The Daily, 
University 
spokesperson 
Rick Fitzgerald explained 
Mason Hall was chosen as the 
pilot location in part because 
it was the site of the scare, 
but also since it is an LSA and 
central campus building used 
by many undergraduates. 
Heather 
Young, 
DPSS 
director of strategic commu-
nications, emphasized the 
decision to implement door 
locks in Mason Hall is not 
directly related to the March 
incident, as she explained 
talks between LSA and DPSS 
began in December.

A

ugust has always had a 
tangible, special air for me. It 
is undeniably the beginning of 
the end — the end of summer, of feeling 
the sun on your skin, of family vacations, 
of internships and jobs, of being able 
to take a day and just breathe without 
classes or deadlines or meetings or 
reading or anything else. But as the first 
Canvas notifications begin to appear in 
my inbox and Facebook notifications 
alert me of welcome week event 
invitations, it’s impossible to avoid the 
impending term.
I love summer, but strangley to 
some, I love school too. I’ve always 
been exhilarated by the promise of new 
knowledge, the crispness of new school 
supplies and the palpable optimism; 
the idea that this is the semester we will 
all truly dedicate ourselves to school. 
For about a week, nearly everyone is 
the perfect student — approaching new 
ideas with zeal and enthusiasm, and 
actually doing class readings. Though I 
know the magic of the new school year 
will be short-lived, I’ve always felt it.
Welcome week is the week before 
classes begin, when our University’s 
infamous Greek life is in full swing, 
when many students spend days 
partying and drinking. The excitement 
of returning to campus and seeing 
friends is clear, and the most alluring 
social aspects of our school are 
magnified, while the demands of 
academic life only lure in the future.
But there is an undeniable dark side 
to the start of school, too. The culture of 
partying and drinking at the University 
is certainly not unique; most colleges 
face the reality that, despite the legal 
drinking age, many college students 

drink. As of 2016, 57.2 percent of full-
time college students aged 18 to 22 
drank within the past month, and 38 
percent engaged in binge drinking, 
defined as four or more drinks on an 
occasion for women and five or more 
for men. For many students, “going 
out” entails drinking at least this much 
— often more. 
Alcohol 
consumption, 
and 
particularly 
binge 
drinking, 
is 
undeniably unhealthy. Both the short 
and long-term consequences are well 
known to most. But while drinking isn’t 
healthy, it’s common. Approximately 
56 percent of adults over 18 report they 
drank in the last month. So, alcohol 
consumption is not unique to our 
university, or colleges generally. And 
while binge drinking certainly carries 
a heavy, negative connotation, many 
individuals are capable of surpassing 
the number of drinks that constitute 
binge drinking without throwing 
up, blacking out or doing things they 
later regret. Many students engage in 
behaviors that young adults engage in — 
maybe drinking too much occasionally, 
but more or less conducting themselves 
responsibly while doing so.
However, this is definitely not 
the case for everyone. This poses a 
significant problem when we think 
about welcome week. Especially in a 
campus environment where a “work 
hard, play hard” culture permeates 
strongly, a week dedicated to, simply 
put, drinking and partying, heightens 
the risks we face while participating in 
these behaviors. 
When entire days are structured 
solely around alcohol and parties, 
there is an inherent pressure to keep 

drinking. Especially for freshmen 
who likely have less experience with 
these kinds of environments, welcome 
week poses significant danger, and it 
shows. As of 2016, drinking by college 
students aged 18 to 24 contributes to an 
estimated 1,519 deaths annually. It’s not 
uncommon to hear about students who 
had to make hospital trips due to severe 
intoxication — so severe that friends 
fear they might die without medical 
attention. 
Perhaps one of the most hot-
button issues regarding universities, 
and Greek life in particular, is the 
number of sexual assaults that occur 
on campuses. In 2016, the National 
Institute of Alcohol Abuse and 
Alcoholism estimated that there are 
an annual 97,000 sexual assaults by 
students who had been drinking. 
At the University of Michigan, 2018 
brought a 61 percent increase in the 
number of reported sexual assaults 
— attributed not to an increase in 
assaults, but an increase in reporting. 
Pamela Heatlie, Senior Director of the 
Office of Institutional Equity and Title 
IX Coordinator, said, “This is likely due 
to continuing efforts around training 
and awareness of the Policy, as well as 
increased societal awareness of sexual 
misconduct, such as through the 
#MeToo movement.”
I wish to see the best in people 
and places, and how I feel about the 
University of Michigan is no different. 
I love this university, and I wish I 
could say that this issue feels far 
removed, that it hasn’t happened in my 
community, and that it’s getting better. 
And while it has never happened to 
me, everyone knows someone who has 

been impacted by sexual assault. 
The number of reports at the 
University of Michigan rose from 
only 92 in 2017 to 148 in 2018, and 
most of them were not investigated. 
Of the tens of thousands of students 
at the University, this figure still falls 
alarmingly short when contrasted 
with the 23.1 percent of female and 
5.4 percent of male undergraduates 
who experience rape or sexual 
assault via physical force, violence or 
incapacitation. 
There are a hundred things we 
could blame for this. But to me, the 
most important thing we can do, as 
students, is to be aware and hold each 
other and the University accountable. 
This isn’t necessarily about cracking 
down Greek life or drinking or parties. 
College students will inevitably find 
ways to party and drink, regardless 
of the regulations put in place. We 
are not entirely responsible for our 
own campus culture, but we’re not 
powerless either. Creating a safer 
campus for everyone begins by facing 
today’s reality, and sexual assault 
does happen. All the time. U-M, like 
many universities, is often labeled as 
liberal. But on a micro-level, women 
are still objectified and devalued. Binge 
drinking is seen as the norm — to the 
point where sometimes, virtually no 
one is in an alert state of mind. 
When I think about the upcoming 
welcome week, I am excited about the 
fun and reunion that will occur. But 
with all of these factors manifesting 
themselves in one all-encompassing 
week, I can’t help but think about 
what can happen. Young freshmen 
girls approached by older boys who 

can drink more, who are in a familiar 
environment and who have the 
unfortunate inherent advantage of 
being male, surrounded by others 
often too drunk to realize what may 
happen. I can’t help but mourn for 
student survivors of sexual assault 
who may not view welcome week as 
a fun, new beginning, but as a difficult 
reminder.
Instead 
of 
offering 
more 
hypotheticals of what could happen, 
or telling everyone to categorically 
abstain from alcohol consumption, I 
would rather urge everyone to, at the 
very least, be aware. Make sure your 
friends are safe and accounted for, 
but also make sure that all the people 
around you are safe — even those you 
may not know. To members of Greek 
life, hold each other accountable for 
the impression that the community 
creates. Even by doing things as simple 
as calling out your fellow frat brother’s 
female-objectifying 
language, 
or 
telling your friend to maybe sit out 
of the next shot while pregaming, 
we work to create a better Greek life 
system, a better campus and a better 
society generally. 
This welcome week will, sadly, 
be my last. And while I enter with 
optimism for a new year, I also enter 
with trepidation, because I know what 
is at stake. And it is this apprehension 
and awareness that often prevents the 
trauma and even death we hear about 
from friends and in the news, feelings 
we may never truly understand until 
they impact us.

I

n 
August 
1947, 
Britain 
announced the partition of 
the British India Colony, 
creating two separate, indepen-
dent nations: the Republic of 
India and the Islamic Republic 
of Pakistan. To say the Partition 
was controversial would be an 
understatement; it has, nearly 
single-handedly, 
defined 
the 
geopolitics of the region since. In 
the decades following, the Parti-
tion India and Pakistan have 
quarrelled ceaselessly, fighting 
over land and power. However, 
no issue has been more conten-
tious than the dispute over the 
region of Kashmir. Driven by 
the forces of Hindu nationalism, 
India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata 
Party, with President Narendra 
Modi at the helm, have made 
rash decisions in an attempt to 
gain political clout, both endan-
gering the region’s (limited) 
stability and forsaking India’s 
founding principles. 
Like many of the issues which 
define the India-Pakistan con-
flict, tensions over Kashmir have 
been present since the day the 
two nations became indepen-
dent. Lead by the last British 
Raj, Viceroy Louis Mountbatten, 
the objective of Partition was to 
divide the British territory along 
religious lines, with Hindus in 
India and Muslims in Pakistan. 
Unsurprisingly, this exercise in 
oversimplified 
nation-building 
went poorly: it lacked adequate 
consideration 
for 
religious 
minorities like Sikhs, and the 
lines themselves were not drawn 
particularly well, leading as 
many as 15 million people to try 
and flee across the newly created 
India-Pakistan border. 
Caught in the middle of 
the chaos was Kashmir, an 
area which Mountbatten was 
unsure how to handle. Though 
the region was majority Mus-
lim, it had close cultural ties to 
greater India. Ultimately, Kash-
miri leaders were permitted to 
choose between remaining inde-
pendent or joining either nation. 
While Kashmir initially chose 
independence, Pakistan soon 
invaded in an attempt to conquer 
it, leading to a UN intervention 
and a ceasefire. Included with 
the ceasefire was a UN-backed 
border division which gave near-
ly all of the land from the origi-
nal, colonial province to India. 
In 1950, India passed constitu-
tional Amendment 370, which 

allowed Kashmir a great deal of 
political autonomy, something 
which made it unique among 
Indian states. Though conflict 
over Kashmir has persisted since 
1950, the fundamental workings 
of its political existence have 
remained largely unchanged, at 
least until very recently. 
Earlier this week, Kashmir’s 
political fate took a dramatic 
turn thanks to Modi and the 
BJP. Under Modi’s command, 
the Indian government sent 
10,000 military troops into the 
region, forced people into their 
houses and cut off internet. 
Though this was the most dras-
tic action Modi has taken, it is all 
part of his larger plan to essen-
tially annex Kashmir.

In addition to simply using 
military force, Modi is work-
ing with the Indian govern-
ment to remove a Kashmiri law, 
included under Amendment 370, 
that does not permit foreigners 
to buy property in the region, 
something which was imple-
mented to preserve its unique 
cultural and religious positions 
and allow Kashmiri Muslims to 
remain a majority. In addition 
to that, the Modi-led govern-
ment plans to repeal Amend-
ment 370 as a whole, and they 
have revealed plans to divide 
the region into two provinces, 
one of which would contain a 
Hindu majority and be ruled 
directly by New Delhi. In doing 
this, Modi would have annexed a 
historically autonomous Muslim 
region, with the goal of making 
it a Hindu-majority Indian prov-
ince. 
Though this is obviously not 
the first time an Indian lead-
er has looked to expand the 
nation’s territory, this is a par-
ticularly concerning move for 
several reasons. First, it reflects 
the forces of populist nation-
alism, which Modi and many 
other leaders of his ilk utilize. A 

common move among populist 
leaders is making decisions with 
the primary goal of firing up 
their political base, even if they 
are divisive or do not benefit the 
country as a whole. In this situ-
ation, it is clear Modi believes 
that politically and religiously 
annexing Kashmir will appeal 
to his Hindu nationalist base, 
allowing him to retain voters 
going forward.
However, like many moves 
aimed primarily at firing up 
one’s political base, this will 
certainly have many negative 
externalities. Kashmir is already 
extremely dangerous thanks to 
longstanding 
India-Pakistan 
tensions, and a surprise annexa-
tion of the area is likely to spur 
more conflict, inciting violence 
and potentially leading to the 
deaths of civilians. Further-
more, it is unclear how the 
region’s Muslims, who learned 
of India’s annexation goals via 
military crackdown, will be 
treated in the coming months by 
the government. 
While this move is based in 
Modi’s Hindu nationalism, it 
also represents an attack on 
one of India’s basic governing 
principles: religious freedom. 
Although Mountbatten and the 
British attempted to divide India 
and Pakistan along religious 
lines, India decided to become 
a secular state with no national 
religion, despite being around 
80 percent Hindu (this contrasts 
with the “Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan”). Despite containing 
both a Hindu majority and a 
great number of religious minor-
ities, India has managed to main-
tain its secular status ever since 
its founding. However, Modi’s 
Hindu nationalism stands in 
direct contrast to India’s prin-
ciple of state secularism, and 
Modi’s actions in Kashmir could 
damage the latter. Annexing 
Kashmir in the name of advanc-
ing Hindu political power puts 
India’s secularism into question, 
and creates a dangerous prec-
edent going forward. Ultimately, 
while India and Pakistan have 
long fought over regional terri-
tory, including Kashmir, Modi’s 
actions represent a religious, 
nationalist assault on India’s leg-
acy of secular governance and 
are cause for concern. 

Indian nationalism reaches north

S

waying prairie grasses as 
tall as your shoulders. Cor-
ralled animals prancing in 
the distance. Folk-band cadences 
mixing with the setting sun. Farm 
to table buffet food spread out 
under a barn awning. These are 
the makings of a summer farm 
dinner, complete with locals and 
low impact foods. In Ann Arbor, 
Green Things farm hosts these 
evening picnics with food pre-
pared from farm fresh ingredi-
ents. I’ve gone with my family 
several times and felt welcomed by 
the cultivated land, enjoyed deli-
cious, fresh food and explored the 
raspberry patches. The appeal of 
slow food became obvious to me: 
I got to see first-hand the impact 
of quality ingredients and sustain-
able production practices. 
The term “Slow Food” comes 
from the worldwide organization 
of the same name which wishes to 
bring clean and healthy foods to 
people all around the world. Their 
website describes slow food suc-
cinctly, stating, “Slow Food is food 
that’s good for us, good for our 
environment and good for the peo-
ple who grow, pick and prepare it. 
In other words, food that is good, 
clean and fair … Slow Food is fresh 
and healthy, free of pesticides and 
chemicals and produced in a way 
that’s beneficial to all — from the 
farmer to the eater.” The organi-
zation also stands against the use 
of GMOs and supports the notion 
that decreasing the consumption 
of meat will greatly benefit the 
environment. Their progressive 
stance is one I believe in and one 
I know could help reduce the car-
bon emissions made from farm 
products. 
Every type of farmed food cre-
ates emissions and contributes to 
the growing epidemic of climate 
change. Our task is to decide each 
day what kind of ingredients we 
are choosing to purchase and use 
that may be able to reduce our car-
bon footprints. Of course, a vegan 
diet would be the most environ-
mentally-friendly as it eliminates 
the need for animal products, 
dairy and all of the emissions 
and resources used to keep farm 
animals. However, if you can’t 
take the full plunge into vegan-
ism, there are alternative ways to 
keep emissions low, like simply 
reducing your meat and dairy con-
sumption or cutting out red meat 
completely as its high concentra-
tion of emissions is harmful to the 
environment. 

The slow food campaign can 
help combat harmful food prac-
tices and ultimately cut down our 
impact on the environment. By 
engaging with local food produc-
ers, we can cut down several envi-
ronmental costs of transportation 
and emissions. The organization 
is pushing to create a sustainable 
loop between consumers and pro-
ducers that is admirable. Their 
work across the world is aimed 
at changing lifestyles and help-
ing 
epidemics. 
John 
Kariuki, 
Kenyan Leader Summit attend-
ee, explained their goals from a 
worldwide 
standpoint, 
stating, 
“We all share the responsibility 
for the future, and as Slow Food 
in Africa we believe in collabora-
tion and not aid. Our combined 
efforts can increase the global 
cooperation, 
awareness, 
grass-
roots 
interventions 
and 
push 
policy makers towards a more sus-
tainable future.” Many countries 
lack the resources to have access 
to quality food, so a push towards 
intervention is needed in order to 
ensure people are being fed. 
I truly admire the concept of 
slow food, but at the same time, I 
question the accessibility. Qual-
ity ingredients, organic items and 
locally farmed ingredients notori-
ously come at a higher price. This 
price imbalance makes me worry 
that not all people can access this 
kind of product. We must make 
slow food more accessible through 
an increase in local markets, the 
reduction of costs or even pushing 
local foods into more corporate 
companies. While these changes 
may be difficult to implement, I 
think slow food should be priori-
tized and made into a more com-
mon product in order to reduce 
prices and widen audiences. 
Slow food is a promising strat-
egy in sustainability. It shifts the 
view of food production to local 
farmers and their hard work, 
which allows a decrease in food 
transportation and the produc-
tion of less emissions. If this 
inspiring outlook on the way we 
purchase and obtain food can 
become a more accessible and 
localized option, it will become 
an inclusive way to combat cli-
mate change. Through conscious 
efforts to consume less environ-
mental affectors, we can individ-
ually strive toward a safer future 
and healthier food intake.

Surprise 
annexation of the 
area is likely to 
spur more conflict


There are two stereotypes that 
routinely plague the modern writ-
er. One is the recluse, the innocent 
bookworm, who recedes into the 
woods like Thoreau and writes 
about butterflies and the mean-
ing of life for days on end. No one 
knows how they subsist on tea and 
biscuits alone. The other is, essen-
tially, the newspaper editor from 
“Spider-Man.” These writers are 
the human equivalent of a pack of 
Marlboro Reds. In between yelling 
about the deadline and chugging 
acrid coffee, they stay up until 2 
a.m. trying to finish a piece on what 
Quentin Tarantino means to them. 
I like to think of these arche-
types as the bookends of the spec-
trum for self-branded writers. Jia 
Tolentino, celebrated staff writer 
for The New Yorker and author of 
the recently-released essay collec-
tion “Trick Mirror,” sits smack dab 
in the middle. 
Tolentino, who young writ-
ers and journalists (or at least the 
ones I know) have christened the 
second coming of Susan Sontag, is 
unabashedly honest in her analysis. 
With that honesty, and her place-
ment as the fulcrum of a made-up 
personality scale, she is somehow 
able to write about everything with 
the charm and hilarity of an expert 
in each topic. It’s an uncanny skill, 

one that allows her to attack sub-
jects like the rise of “step on my 
neck” fandom with the same feroc-
ity she does when dissecting the 
history of Trump’s assault allega-
tions. “There could potentially be a 
world in which I write about books 
all day,” Tolentino said in a phone 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily, “but it’s nice to accurately 
reflect literally just what’s on my 
mind.”
When I called Tolentino a few 
weeks ago for this interview, I 
didn’t feel the same anxiety that I 
typically do when on assignment. 
It must have been because I felt 
like I already knew her, the same 
way that I assume many of her 
thousands of Twitter and Insta-
gram followers do, too. The writer 
has always been game to share her 
thoughts: “There are certain types 
of personalities that the internet 
favors, that can work well within 
the performative structures of the 
internet.” She added, “I’ve always 
had that kind of personality, I’ve 
always been extremely open.” 
Tolentino takes to social media 
with an ease often only seen in 
figure skaters and birds of prey 
swooping through the air. She 
knows what she’s doing, but she 
might as well have fun on the ride. 
Watching 
Tolentino’s 
rise 
through the annals of literary jour-
nalism has been exciting, to say the 
least. To see someone unapologeti-
cally young be so successful at not 
only digital media through her edi-

torship at Jezebel, but then become 
a star in the crown of traditional 
magazine publishing, gives hope to 
a so-called dying industry. She has 
no niche, no specific beat, no bor-
ders to her sea of subjects.
“I don’t want to write about 
the same things all the time, and I 
don’t think about the same things 
all the time, or think at the same 
level of seriousness all the time,” 
she elaborated. “You can really 
throw your voice around, like at 
Jezebel I could write dead serious 
about something and then I could 
write something so stupid, like a 
meme, about a subject that I take 
very seriously.” In the same vein, 
the writer has never given up her 
wit and cultural precocity in lieu 
of her literary venue’s unspoken 
parameters. 
Her piece about the rise of Juul-
ing was hilarious, yes, but it was 
also in the top 10 most read New 
Yorker articles of 2018. In my own 
experience, I’ve used her articles 
to explain things like vaping to my 
parents, but my friends and I also 
applaud her for getting the phrase 
“real men eat ass” into a heritage 
magazine. She has struck gold in 
a balancing act, one that is enter-
taining to watch her navigate in its 
own right.
“Trick Mirror” is no exception 
to the rule of her talent, instead 
acting as an extension of both her 
writing for other publications and 
personality alone. Tolentino is 
the only writer I can think of that 

picks apart the Book of Revelation 
and the history of MDMA in the 
same breath. It’s what makes her so 
refreshing to read, in a media land-
scape clogged with sadness and 
fluff. Reading her writing means 
laughing and learning at the same 
time. 
Tolentino 
walks 
the 
line 
between comedy and blinding 
truth 
carefully, 
successfully 
rep-
licating the path 
that we all tra-
verse 
through-
out our lives in 
her writing. Her 
transparency 
on 
social media fol-
lows 
the 
same 
rules. “It seems 
like the only way 
of making social 
media bearable is 
literally just not 
thinking about what you’re doing 
and hope that it’s ok! Because it’s 
just like life, you know?” Tolentino 
continued, laughing, “I actively 
try to guard against … that sort 
of calcification — I try to allow a 
lot of space for inconsistency.” I 
believe this avoidance of creating 
a “brand” is what makes the writer 
so approachable. She is incredibly 
smart, incredibly online, incredibly 
funny, yet Tolentino’s understand-
ing of her own identity creates a 
level of comfort that serves as the 
foundation for that variety. 
In “Trick Mirror,” Tolentino 
writes about religion, scams, drugs, 
athleisure — everything under the 
sun. But it’s always obvious who’s 
talking — the writer captures the 
human phenomenon of curiosity 
better than anyone I’ve ever read. 
The inconsistency she was talking 
about isn’t a negative trait of the 
modern era, as it is typically seen, 
but a strength. The pressures of 
the internet, as she speaks about in 
the book’s first essay, have forced 
many to turn themselves into a 
solidified brand, avoiding change 
at any cost. We have to remember 
that although it seems like self-
branding is necessary, we’re not all 
Kardashians here.
Tolentino, however, embraces 
that unpredictability and runs 
with it. Reading her essays makes 
you feel like you could learn any-
thing, because hey, Jia did. Know-
ing yourself is a more crucial asset 
than anything else these days, 
and allows for a bigger worldview. 
Tolentino’s talent is capturing this 
perspective in words, inspiring her 
readers to take the same leap. 
Beyond her raw talent for writ-
ing, Tolentino’s “it” factor, the 

reason “Trick Mirror” is flying off 
shelves and appearing every three 
tweets in my newsfeed, is her gen-
uine excitement for life. The last 
four years have been a rollercoast-
er, something that Tolentino says 
was the impetus for her book in the 
first place: “I was so miserable in 
early 2017, and I was like, I’m going 
to be miserable for the next four 
years.” She reflect-
ed, “A book is one 
way to be miser-
able in a way that’s 
really productive.” 
Productive or not, 
the fruit of her 
misery is surpris-
ingly 
optimistic. 
The world since 
2016 has seemed 
like a cruel joke to 
many, but she sees 
a reason to laugh 
at it. To Tolentino, 
the urgent nature of our country’s 
problems are countered by brilliant 
art, books and cultural phenomena 
that make surviving the darkness 
worth it. 
Tolentino is fascinated by Gen 
Z and their relationship with the 
media and internet. We talked 
extensively about the differences 
in social media between those in 
my age group, her millennial expe-
rience and the experiences of those 
younger than me. She interviewed 
many Gen Z-ers for an upcom-
ing piece, saying that “It’s really 
interesting, as someone who still 
interacts with the world as a young 
person, to be talking to these teen-
agers, and I’m asking them about 
these extremely basic facts of life, 
like it’s really nothing to them, and 
it’s very clear they feel as though 
they’re talking to someone that’s 
70, you know?” Despite this, they 
would probably find Tolentino’s 
writing pretty interesting, maybe 
even let out a giggle or two. She 
is undeniably relevant to any age 
group, something that not many 
people can claim. 
“I feel weirdly gratified by get-
ting, I mean, especially with femi-
nism, an email from a 75-year-old 
woman, being like, ‘I really like 
this thing you wrote,’” Tolentino 
said on the subject. She has active-
ly avoided settling into the siloed 
nature of modern media, instead 
challenging herself to get over 
that “internal hurdle,” “like (she’s) 
going to write a piece about a phe-
nomenon that has to make sense to 
somebody who has no idea about 
anything about it.”

“You can never publish my love,” 
Rogue Wave chants, in the song that 
the title of this series riffs on. Maybe 
that’s true, and we can never quite 
account for our love on paper or in 
print, but we sure can try. That’s 
what this series is devoted to: pub-
lishing our love. Us, the Arts section 
of The Michigan Daily, talking about 
artists, some of the people we love 
the most. Perhaps these are futile 
approximations of love for the poet 
who told us we deserve to be heard, 
the director who changed the way 
we see the world, the singer we see 
as an old friend. But who ever said 
futile can’t still be beautiful?
Last summer, I spent a lot of 
time wandering around Boston 
listening to music. I wasn’t lonely, 
exactly — I was living with my 
best friend — but we both worked, 
and I was often alone, on the bus 
to a catering gig or entering data 
into a spreadsheet at my intern-
ship. Every week, I walked from 
our third-floor bedroom in Mis-
sion Hill to the main branch of the 
downtown library, which was a 
two-mile straight shot down Hun-
tington Avenue, and I listened to 
The Be Good Tanyas.
I first heard The Be Good Tan-
yas when my mom checked out one 
of their CDs from our local library 
in Philadelphia. I was in elemen-
tary school, six or seven years old, 
and I listened to what she listened 
to: Joni Mitchell, Norah Jones, a 
rotating mix of folk singers and 

women whose voices sounded like 
bird calls. The album from the 
library was Blue Horse, The Be 
Good Tanyas’ 2001 debut, and we 
listened to it on the orange wooden 
stereo system my parents kept in 
the living room alcove. 
When I rediscovered The Be 
Good Tanyas in high school, I liked 
Blue Horse for its nostalgic power. 
Still, their music was like an arti-
cle of clothing I was holding onto 
until it fit. Each one of their songs 
was a meditation on emotions I 
hadn’t experienced yet — the real, 
grown-up variations on the fledg-
ling feelings of adolescence. The 
Be Good Tanyas seem to inhabit 
the kind of fullness that is created 
by acknowledging it, by wanting it. 
Their music made me want to be 
the kind of person who would look 
for this largesse. 
During sophomore year of col-
lege, I got back into the Tanyas 
— not just Blue Horse, but also 
Chinatown 
(2003) 
and 
Hello 
Love (2006). That spring, I played 
“Draft Daughter’s Blues” for a guy 
I liked. I wanted to impress him 
with my obscure music taste (ugh), 
and I also thought the way he 
might understand me through the 
song was the way I wanted to be 
understood: “Impossible to keep a 
straight line / Too young to keep 
these bitter hearts / And all around 
me, somebody’s singin’ / Get back, 
get back.”
But even as we listened to it, I 

was already imagining him into 
the mythology of my own life, 
wondering how future-me would 
explain to someone else what our 
relationship had been. I was think-
ing about how he would fade into 
a character who only mattered for 
the ways he exposed something 
truthful about me, my desires, my 
selfishness, my tendency to refuse 
to cede the moral high ground 
even when maintaining my posi-
tion meant hurting the people I 
cared about. As much as I didn’t 
like thinking this way, there was 
something good about it, too, 
knowing I was figuring out unflat-
tering truths about myself. I left 
for Boston as soon as school ended, 
ready to find out if the person I’d 
become in college was a product 
of my influences or something less 
malleable.
When I listened to The Be 
Good Tanyas in Boston last sum-
mer, I finally felt they were sing-
ing to me, about things I was old 
enough to understand. “Keep it 
light enough to travel / Don’t let it 
all unravel,” vocalist Frazey Ford 
sings on “Light Enough to Trav-
el.” This was what I was after in 
Boston: an impossible balance, a 
mixture of freedom and security 
with equal portions of each. More 
concrete lyrics struck me, too: 
“Promise me we won’t go into the 
nightclub / I really think that it’s 
obscene / What kind of people go 
to meet people / Where they can’t 

be heard or seen.” I like how the 
Be Good Tanyas sing about finding 
a nightclub obscene without com-
ing across as frumpy. This became 
something I want to say: “Don’t 
you think nightclubs are obscene?” 
Obscene.
That summer, I wrote in my 
journal that I worried my person-
ality was a “mish-mash of everyone 
I’ve ever admired and that I have 
no original ideas or interests.” It’s 
ironic, then, that The Be Good Tan-
yas have joined the conglomerate 
of people whose personalities and 
interests I have pawned and emu-
lated. I stumbled on my version of 
the anxiety of influence last sum-
mer — a set of fears which is itself 
derivative, proving my point that 
nothing exists outside of its cir-
cumstances. It’s true that I spent 
a month crafting detailed, snarky 
diary entries after I read David 
Sedaris’s “Theft by Finding,” and 
it’s true that I bought my black car-
penter pants because I saw them 
on Man Repeller. Whatever!
The Be Good Tanyas are a 
part of this, giving me something 
less concrete to steal: a mindset, 
a way of walking around while 
I’m listening to their music in my 
headphones. I’ve decided to stop 
feeling uncomfortable about this, 
because cribbing from the people 
I admire is just the way life works 

— and it’s even better to give credit 
to everyone I’ve copied some-
thing from. A non-exhaustive list: 
Caroline’s Swedish clogs, Claire’s 
razor brand, Nora Ephron’s motto 
(everything is copy!), Summer’s 
obsession with the eye makeup in 
“Euphoria,” the star-shaped hoops 
on that girl in my English class. 
Sally’s middle-school cell phone 
and Rory Gilmore’s journalism 
aspirations. Also, a million other 
things. 
In an editorially satisfying twist, 
The Be Good Tanyas are notorious 
for covering other people’s songs. 
“The Lakes of Pontchartrain” 
dates to the 19th century. “For the 
Turnstiles” is a Neil Young song. 
They’ve covered Prince and Blind 
Willie Johnson, and a version of 
“House of the Rising Sun” fits 
nicely into an album of their origi-
nal songs. The Be Good Tanyas 
aren’t shy about reworking other 
people’s material, which seems to 
support my theory that the most 
interesting people have forgotten 
all about the anxiety of influence. 
What I want — what the Tanyas 
have embraced — is the serenity of 
influence, the confidence of influ-
ence, the creative thrill of turn-
ing someone else’s thing into your 
thing and forgetting to be embar-
rassed that someone else always 
did it first.

Admissions more selective, new data shows

First-year acceptance rate decreased, average ACT score increased compared to last year’s admitted students

Early numbers from the University 
of Michigan Office of Undergraduate 
Admissions show a lower first-year 

acceptance rate and stronger ACT 
and grade point average scores 
compared to last year’s admitted 
students.
The first-year acceptance rate 
decreased by 0.08 percent, while 
the transfer student acceptance 
rate increased by 3.3 percent and 

the number of transfer applications 
decreased from last year. The 
admitted students’ average GPA rose 
by 0.02 points and ACT test scores 
rose by one point in the middle 50th 
percentile ACT score range, while 
the SAT test scores see no noticeable 
change. 

LSA freshman Sukainah Khan 
wrote in an email to The Daily she 
believes high test scores and the 
increasingly 
competitive 
college 
process correlate with the use of 
prep books and tutors, which are 
primarily available to higher-income 
students.
“Increasing 
test 
scores 
definitely 
indicates 
an 
upward 
trend in academic excellence and 
competitiveness, but it also brings 
a certain degree of uniformity to 
the student body,” Khan wrote. 
“Certain academic results correlate 
to demographic factors that have 
contributed to students’ ability to 
succeed. There’s a reason why a large 
percentage of the student body at UM 
comes from high-income families.”
LSA sophomore Isabella Yockey 
attended Northville High School, 
a school that regularly sends a 
high percentage of students to the 
University. She said the school 
offers a multitude of resources to 
keep students on the college track, 
such as counselors, tutors and 
representatives from the University.
“At Northville, they took a lot of 
pride on their SAT and ACT scores,” 
Yockey said. “They offered a lot of 
help with raising your scores, in the 
counseling office they offered a lot 
of resources to find tutors and go to 
classes. ... We worked really close 
with our counselors to make sure we 
were on the right track.”
Yockey said she believes the 

help Northville offered her gave 
her an edge when applying to the 
University. She said she thinks 
in-state high schools who are unable 
to offer as many resources may be at 
a disadvantage from an admissions 
perspective.
“I think it’s unfair in the sense that 
the schools don’t have the resources 
to give their students,” Yockey said. 
“I think that since (Northville) is a 
wealthier area, the biggest difference 
is that we were able to be given those 
opportunities.”
Business sophomore Ariana Khan 
agrees with Sukainah Khan, stating 
in an email to The Daily she believes 
test-prep classes play an important 
role in the increase in test scores. 
To 
combat 
this 
socioeconomic 
disparities in college applications, 
Ariana Khan created RealU, a 
company that gives low-income 
and first-generation students an 
opportunity to receive mentorship 
from a college student.
“Many lower-income and first-
generation students did not have 
the opportunities and access to 
connections of experienced adults in 
their field of interest,” Ariana Khan 
wrote. “For this reason, many of the 
students feel lost in the application 
and college search process. We hope 
to make the college search process as 
easy as possible to ensure students 
can enter college confidently.”

Poem: Mother of the sea, of all living and nonliving things

ANA MARIA SANCHEZ-CASTILLO
MiC Senior Editor

I imagine her waves, before I enter 
like hands softly caressing the sand of the shore 
They ease their way towards my feet 
And we meet each other halfway 
Halfway between 
serenity and death 

The balance of 
Delicious paradise and ominosis danger 
Of which the ocean encompasses 

Reminding me that in this part of the world we experience pain 
when we need to 
Sometimes it does not make sense, but everything is not meant to 
These forces, like us, have the control to make integral decisions 
about what is and what is not 

There comes a point, a point of surrender 
Where this larger strength teaches you it can bare more than you 
And you mustw let it 

I sink further into this notion 
Into her motion
and it all begins to feel more like breathing

She builds her waves with an inhale scooping me onto her 
tongue 
It is possible that with this momentum she may swallow me 
whole 
But her exhale pushes me in the direction of the shore
where she relinquishes all that does not serve her 

Today she pulls me in more then pushes me out 
And keeps me balanced in the warmth of her mouth 

I sing to her my gratitude
sometimes a hum 
sometimes the sum of all her power
For this she sings back in the music of fluidity 

like a child, a baby of which she adores
she cradles me and rocks me melodically 
Like a whispered soft song 

I learn she is as grateful for me as I of her

Harbaugh calls Fickell’s claims “erroneous” amid Hudson transfer saga

Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
fired 
back 
at 
Cincinnati coach Luke Fickell 
on Tuesday evening, after 
Fickell 
scolded 
Harbaugh 
for his role in the handling 
of 
tackle 
James 
Hudson’s 
transfer 
and 
immediate 
eligibility waiver.
Hudson, who transferred 
from Michigan to Cincinnati 
last 
October, 
was 
denied 
his petition for immediate 
eligibility 
after 
speaking 
out about his struggle with 
depression while at Michigan.
“Here’s what I believe in 
the whole waiver process: the 
number one, most important 
thing, and all the power, comes 
from the school that a kid 
is leaving. No matter what,” 
Fickell 
told 
The 
Athletic. 
“(Michigan) didn’t back the 
waiver. They can say what they 
want to say, but the only thing 
they said that was positive was 
that if the NCAA chooses to 
make (Hudson) eligible, then 
they would accept it — that 
they didn’t have an angle. They 
are just trying to cover their 
ass. And I’m really, completely 
disappointed in it.”
Harbaugh 
refuted 
that 
claim, noting that it’s within 
the NCAA’s purview -- not 
Michigan’s -- to determine 
Hudson’s 
eligibility, 
and 
that 
Michigan 
did nothing to 
deter 
Hudson’s 
chances.
“I 
read 
Luke 
Fickell’s 
comments 
and 
unless 
I’m 
reading 
them 
wrong 
or 
mistaking 
them, I believe 
he’s under the 
impression that these waivers 
are decided coach to coach in 
some kind of deal fashion. And 
that’s not the understanding 
that I’m under. I’m under the 
understanding that the NCAA 
decides these waivers. Unless 
he has something that he can 
bring forth and share and 
enlighten us and the entire 
football world, I would really 
like to know what that is.
“Erroneous, 
erroneous,” 

Harbaugh then said Tuesday, 
of 
Fickell’s 
assertions. 
“Michigan did not block the 
waiver, no. We wish James 
Hudson well but that is not 
in the coach’s hands, it’s not 
in the university’s hands. It’s 
not in his hands. It’s the way 
the process works right now. 
Those 
waivers 
are decided by 
the NCAA.”
The 
NCAA’s 
decision 
on 
Hudson 
comes 
amid 
a 
flurry 
of 
inquiries 
from 
transfers, 
some of whom 
successfully 
gain 
eligibility 
while others fail 
to do so. Michigan quarterback 
Shea Patterson, of course, was 
granted immediate eligibility 
to play last season after leaving 
Ole Miss, which was under 
heavy NCAA sanctions at the 
time. This year, Ohio State 
quarterback 
Justin 
Fields 
will be immediately eligible, 
leaving Georgia after he was 
subjected to racist comments 
from a baseball player.
The 
NCAA’s 
rulings 
in 

these situations have become 
notoriously 
difficult 
to 
predict. The NCAA provision 
states that a player can receive 
immediate eligibility if “the 
transfer is due to documented 
mitigating 
circumstances 
that are outside the student-
athlete’s control and directly 
impact the health, safety and 
well-being of the student-
athlete.”
Hudson and Fickell certainly 
felt his circumstances met 
those criteria, though Hudson 
never expressed his feelings 
of 
depression 
to 
school 
administrators. 
This 
public 
back 
and 
forth comes just weeks after 
Harbaugh insinuated players 
often feel the need to fabricate 
reasons 
to 
seek 
eligibility 
-- comments that drew the 
ire of those who felt he was 
directly suggesting Hudson 
misrepresented 
his 
mental 
health.
“And the other piece that 
bothers me about it is, the 
youngster that says ‘this is 
a mental health issue, I’m 
suffering from depression.’ Or 
that’s a reason to get eligible,” 
Harbaugh said at Big Ten 

Media Days, in the context 
of 
post-transfer 
eligibility.. 
And once that’s known that 
‘Hey, say this or say that’ to 
get eligible. The problem I see 
in that is you’re going to have 
guys that are ‘OK, yeah, I’m 
depressed.’
Glenda 
Hudson, 
James’ 
mother, recalled 
to The Athletic 
receiving a text 
from 
her 
son 
shortly after.
“My son text 
me and told me, 
‘Coach called me 
a liar, mom,’ she 
said.
Days 
later, 
Harbaugh issued 
a tweet to clarify 
his remarks, stating “My belief 
is that a one-time transfer 
should be allowed for all 
student athletes. I am clearly 
advocating 
for 
rights 
that 
college football players have 
not had.” He reiterated that 
stance Tuesday, which, were 
it NCAA policy, would render 
this entire situation moot.
But it’s not. And Harbaugh 
said Tuesday that when Fickell 
initially reached out to him to 

discuss Hudson’s situation, 
Fickell “tried to coach me 
into saying it differently”, 
presumably in an attempt to 
sway the NCAA toward a more 
lenient ruling. 
“I called him to say that I 
don’t know what’s going on 
with all these waivers, but I 
know James is 
here,” 
Fickell 
told 
The 
Athletic. 
“Are 
you guys going 
to be vindictive 
against him, or 
do you want to 
help this kid?”
“And I told 
him, ‘Coach I 
mean I believe 
you’re 
telling 
the 
truth, 
forthright,’ 
” 
Harbaugh recalled. “ ‘What 
I told James, what I told 
you, what I told compliance 
is going to be the truth.’ As 
I said, I read the article. He 
asked a question in the article, 
‘What’s 
most 
important: 
personal beliefs or what’s in 
the best interest of the kid?’ 
And I can answer that. What’s 
most important is the truth.”

ALEXANDRIA POMPEI/Daily
Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh denies any interference with tackle James Hudson’s transfer and preaches truth and integrity.

I’m under the 
understanding 
that the NCAA 
decides ...

I can answer 
that. What’s 
most important 
is the truth.

Fans at the Big House share thoughts on state of U.S. soccer

The pregame festivities ahead 
of Saturday’s friendly between 
FC Barcelona and SSC Napoli 
was vastly different than most 
tailgates at Michigan Stadium. 
International 
music 
echoed 
throughout the parking lots as 
people from all over the country 
prepared to see some of the 
world’s most talented soccer 
players.
But for the magnitude of the 
teams playing, the number of fans 
in attendance was a relatively 
mere 60,000, filling just over half 
of the seats at Michigan Stadium.
One of the main purposes of 
the 
International 
Champions 
Cup is to improve the following 
of soccer in America and the 
audience’s demographic showed 
that it’s clearly working — some 
were from as far as Texas and 
North Carolina. 
“It’s 
crazy 
because 
these 
teams barely come and you have 
to see these teams over there in 
their country,” said Javier from 
Chicago. “For them to come here, 
it’s kinda like, you know what, 
one-time opportunity, you gotta 
take it and come to the game and 
just enjoy it.”
But these fans who traveled to 
get the chance to watch premier 
soccer grew up in countries 
whose cultures idolized soccer 
— Poland, Honduras, Mexico, 
Costa Rica and more. They were 
raised around the sport and treat 
it like Americans might baseball 
or football.
Since the turn of the century, 
the United States 
men’s soccer team 
has 
repeatedly 
failed to position 
itself 
as 
World 
Cup 
contender. 
The 
MLS 
has 
grown, but still 
finds 
itself 
a 
league where the 
biggest names are 
already past their 
prime 
and 
the 
best young players don’t stay for 
long. And though the women’s 
national soccer team has won the 
last two World Cups, the sport 
finds itself as an afterthought to 
American football, basketball, 
and baseball.
“I don’t want to say it’s 
humiliating, but I want to say 
that it’s a reminder of what we 

could (be) if we decide to allocate 
our resources the right way,” said 
Parker from Washington D.C. 
who got into the sport through 
a college class. “I just feel like, 
I think we’re at a point in the 
narrative of professional sports 
where people are getting tired of 
football for a number of reasons 
that are all valid. And you’re 
going to see more kids getting 
access to soccer and traveling 
more and being more competitive 
at younger ages, so I think the 
future is bright, honestly.”
This sentiment was one that 
fans throughout the stadium 
shared.
“Soccer 
is 
drawing 
more 
fans as time goes by, but I think 
(American fans) are liking the 
star players here,” said Oscar, 
a 35-year FC Barcelona fan 
originally from Honduras. “They 
have the financial means to 
make it happen. But it’s just the 
way they do it that’s not really 
relevant. They’re bringing not-
quality players from overseas.
“It’s also just that the way they 
structure the (MLS) without 
relegation and stuff like that, 
doesn’t make it that competitive 
compared 
to 
the 
European 
leagues.”
Oscar brought up a valid 
point — bringing attention to 
the domestic league is a key 
component to increasing the 
fandom of the sport in America. 
However, the MLS struggled 
to get going in the first place, 
something 
many 
European 
leagues were devoid of, as it was 
just another shot at an American 
soccer 
league 
that 
became 
subject to a tight 
salary cap space 
due to previously 
failed attempts.
Now, 
with 
the MLS finally 
taking 
off 
and 
salary 
cap 
space 
being 
created, 
albeit 
at 
a 
relatively 
slow 
pace, 
the 
competition of the 
league is something that takes a 
lot more effort to change. Though 
the United Soccer League, or the 
USL, is sometimes considered to 
be a minor league to the MLS, 
it doesn’t receive the attention 
or respect that the English 
Championship receives as the 
next level down from the English 
Premier League, eliminating the 

current attempt at relegation. 
Moreover, MLS teams haven’t 
participated 
in 
international 
tournaments 
like 
European 
teams who get a shot at the UEFA 
Champions League every year. 
Such changes cannot be made 
during a single offseason, either, 
but they are definitely something 
to think about.
Javier, a 21-year-old who has 
played soccer for a majority of his 
life, offered a player’s perspective 
— 
though 
signing 
big-name 
players and increasing domestic 
competition 
is 
important, 
surrounding today’s youth with 
the right coaching staff is what 
will make soccer a staple in the 
United States. 
“I feel like the United States 
needs to bring the coaches from 
other countries to teach these 
young 
players,” 
Javier 
said. 
“Their playing style, their tactics. 
It’s a different type of soccer to 
develop.”
But the optimism remains 

present among these fans, and 
they think that events like the 
International Champions Cup 
combined with more attention 
to soccer players’ development 
is 
driving 
the 
sport’s 
growing 
popularity 
in 
America.
“I think soccer 
is growing (in the 
United 
States), 
and I think in 10 
years, 12 years, 
the US can win 
the World Cup,” 
said 
Rubin, 
another fan from 
Chicago. “I think the US is doing 
great with the minor league 
teams, if that’s what you want to 
call it. Kids nowadays, it’s such a 
diverse (talent pool) that they’re 
going to have a strong team. In 
8 years, they’re going to be one 
of the strongest teams in the 
world.”
Now, 
the 
expectations 

are 
slightly 
unrealistic 
considering that the country’s 
talent is nowhere near that of 
powerhouses like Germany and 
France. But the resources and 
spotlight are there 
for soccer to take 
off in the United 
States. Now, it’s 
up to the nation to 
focus on building 
a 
culture 
that 
treats soccer like 
a premier sport, 
similar 
to 
the 
countries 
where 
many 
of 
these 
fans come from. 
And it all starts with events like 
the 
International 
Champions 
Cup.
“I hope the people had a 
great match, that they enjoyed 
watching it,” said FC Barcelona 
midfielder Frenkie De Jong. “(I 
hope) that they got a bit inspired 
but it’s all up to their chance 
(now).”

F.C. Barcelona cruises to a 4-0 victory against S.S.C Napoli

It took 47 minutes for the 
floodgates to open Saturday 
evening.
Over the course of 15 minutes 
early in the second half, F.C. 
Barcelona 
rattled 
off 
four 
straight goals to power its way to 
a 4-0 victory over S.S.C. Napoli.
The 
two 
European 
clubs 
squared off in front of a heavily 
pro-Barcelona crowd of 60,043. 
It 
was 
small 
by 
Michigan 
Stadium standards, especially in 
light of its soccer history.
In 2014, The Big House set 
the record for the biggest crowd 
ever at an international soccer 
match in the United States, 
attracting 109,318 fans when 
Manchester United took on Real 
Madrid. Saturday was the fourth 
international soccer game that 
has been played at Michigan 
Stadium since 2014, drawing the 
lowest attendance of the four. 
“In the first half we were 

very dominant,” said Barcelona 
coach Ernesto Valverde through 
a translator. “We were unable 
to score, but the game was 
ours from our point of view. 
Overall, we had a good game. 
In the second half we were also 
dominant, but the game opened 
up a little more and we were able 
to pressure and score.”
Barcelona is known for is 
possessive style of play, and 
it was on full display against 
Napoli. The Spanish side held 
possession for 58 percent of 
the match, completing over 91 
percent of its pass attempts. 
When it didn’t have possession, 
Barcelona’s defensive pressure 
often prevented Napoli from 
working into its attacking third.
Barcelona 
forward 
Luis 
Suarez opened up scoring in 
the 48th minute off a rebound 
after Napoli goalkeeper Alex 
Meret saved Barcelona forward 
Antoine Griezmann’s one-on-
one 
opportunity. 
He 
added 
another goal 10 minutes later 

which put his side up 3-0.
Newly signed forward Antoine 
Griezmann also notched his first 
goal for Barcelona in the 56th 
minute after making his club 
debut in late July. He finished 
on a cross from defender Jordi 
Alba inside the six-yard box for 
an easy tap-in score.
Forward Ousmane Dembélé 
added the fourth and final goal 
in the 63rd minute. Midfielder 
Frenkie De Jong, Barcelona’s 
other high-profile signing this 
summer, found Dembélé with 
space on the right wing. He cut 
inside towards the top of the 
18-yard box and finished past an 
outstretched Meret.
What started off looking like 
a stalemate through 47 minutes 
quickly 
became 
a 
decisive 
victory for Barcelona.
“I think we played well in the 
first half,” De Jong said. “We

New talent put on display in final tune-up match for F.C Barcelona

Two out of four potential 
trophies made their way home to 
Catalonia last season. That did 
not stop a wave of disappointment 
and criticism from engulfing FC 
Barcelona this summer.
The reality is that winning 
only two out of four trophies last 
season is a letdown for a club 
that has won 74 domestic and 
20 international trophies in its 
storied history. Despite winning 
La Liga and the Supercopa de 
España, the team still entered 
the offseason with a bitter taste 
in its mouth.
Barcelona 
blew 
a 
3-0 
aggregate lead to Liverpool in 
the Champions League semifinal 
— allowing four goals in the 
second leg at Anfield— and lost 
2-1 to Valencia in the Copa Del 
Rey final. Both trophies were 
seemingly in their grasp but 
slipped away.
This summer, the Spanish side 
made two big splashes on the 
transfer market, acquiring a pair 
of superstars in French forward 
Antione Griezmann and Dutch 
midfielder Frenkie De Jong. 

Now, more than ever, Barcelona 
fans expect results.
“It’s the last game of the 
pre-league and we’re going to 
have to show what we’re doing 
this year and hopefully show 
how things will end up in the 
league,” Valverde 
said 
through 
a 
translator.
“We’re 
not 
going to deceive 
ourselves; 
the 
manager 
of 
Barcelona 
is 
always 
the 
one 
who 
is 
asked 
these 
questions 
and people always 
have 
to 
think 
about when we 
lose more than when we win. So, 
we have to be ready to answer 
those questions. And I’m always 
the person who needs to be open 
to speaking about our defeats. 
We are in the situation where 
we have to win as many games 
as possible, and if there are 
criticisms now for a certain game 
or something that happened in 
the past, those are going to be 
criticisms, but my job is to make 
sure that we’re winning going 

forward.”
In 
Saturday’s 
match, 
the 
two new additions started and 
received ample playing time. 
Griezmann netted his first goal 
for Barcelona in the second 
half after missing a quality 
opportunity 
to 
score from inside 
the six-yard box in 
the early minutes 
of the game. De 
Jong 
dominated 
the 
midfield 
— 
facilitating play in 
the middle of the 
pitch and rarely 
making a mistake.
The 
club 
fared well, even 
without forward 
Lionel Messi, winning easily 
against last season’s Serie A 
runner-up. And both De Jong and 
Griezmann figure to be featured 
regularly in the starting 11.
Though Saturday’s exhibition 
match was exactly that — an 
exhibition — it marked the 
last tune up for the Spanish 
champions and the final chance 
for the newcomers to integrate 
into the lineup before league 
play begins.
