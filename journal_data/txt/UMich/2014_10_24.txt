FOOTBALL
AD: Ticket
prices will
drop nearly
40 percent

In partnership with
CSG, football ticket
packages to be $175
for 2015 season
By GREG GARNO and
ALEJANDRO ZIY&GA

The Michigan football team has
a much stronger home schedule
next season than it does this fall.
And it'll cost students a lot less to
see the Wolverines play.
TheAthleticDepartment,incon-
junction with the Central Student
Government, announced Thursday
it will lower student season ticket
prices to $175 for next year's seven-
game home slate. At an average of
$25 per game, the price decrease
is a 37.5-percent change from this
year's cost of $280 for the season.
"We listen," Athletic Director
Dave Brandon told The Michi-
gan Daily Thursday afternoon.
"We've been listening.... We really
learned that two really important
components to re-engaging with
our students in trying to create a
more robust, more enthusiastic

and larger student section for next
year's football season was price and
strength of schedule.
"A nearly 40-percent reduction
in ticket prices is, I think it's fair to
say, unprecedented."
The new plan, which incorporat-
ed feedback from a CSG-conducted
survey of University students, will
also implement a new reduced-
pricing structure*for students with
financial need.
The Athletic Department will
charge a $10 processing fee for stu-
dent-ticket purchases, down from
$15 in 2013, and a custom T-shirt
comes included in the package.
The department also announced
that season ticket prices will
remain the same for non-students
for the third consecutive year.
"It's been great working togeth-
er," said CSG President Bobby
Dishell, a Public Policy senior, in an
interview with the Daily. "We real-
ized that the University takes need
into account when you're com-
ing here, so your experiences here
should also take that into account."
Dishell announced his partner-
ship with the Athletic Department

ing of the University's Board of

As performances, motiva-
tional speeches, slam poetry
and chants filled the brisk
Thursday night, a few hundred
students gathered on the Diag
for Maize Night Madness, an
event geared toward increasing


school spirit and morale before
the Michigan football team
faces Michigan State this week-
end in East Lansing.
LSA senior John Borger,
who helped organize the event
along with the campus group
Beat OSU, said the pep rally was
designed to highlight the hard
work of University students and
what the school has to offer,
including the work of athletes
and student groups.
"Whether it's on a football
field or in the classroom or in
a research lab or on the stage,
all these performers are doing
incredible things," Borger said.

"We're not the number one
public institution because of
the football team. We're not the
number one public institution
because of any one team, or any
one classroom. It's the whole,
University."
Maize Night Madness includ-
ed performances from several
dance groups and appearances
by the football, field hockey and
men's and women's basketball
teams, as well as two student
poets and a variety of other
groups.
LSA freshman Helen Joa said
she attended the event after she
heard about it online and from

posters around campus.
"There was a lot of hype
surrounding it so I wanted to'
see what it was all about," Joa
said. "I really liked all the dif-
ferent groups that performed
the dances. I thought that was
really cool. I didn't know about
some of the clubs that are here
so it was cool to get to learn'
more about them."
Borger said the rally was
held Thursday to celebrate the
upcomingfootballgame against'
Michigan State and to kick
off the basketball and hockey
seasons. Organizers hosted a

host event for state

For theDaily
Metro Detroit attorney Rich-
ard Bernstein, a University
alum, returned to his alma mater
Thursday evening to speak and
field questions from a short panel
hosted by the University's chapter
of the College Democrats.
Bernstein is currently a Demo-
cratic candidate for a seat on the
Michigan Supreme Court. He was
born legally blind, and, referenc-
ing his campaign slogan of "Blind
Justice," said his campaign is
founded upon fairness.
"It is time for our courts to
become blind. Blind to partisan
politics, blind to special interests,
blind to political ideology," he
said. "Fairness is really the key to
justice."
Bernstein is an attorney for the
Detroit-area Sam Bernstein Law
Firm, where he founded and runs
the firm's Public Services Divi-
sion. He previously served on the
Wayne State University Board of
Governors, and his brother, Mark,
currently serves on the Univer-

Additions to non-
discrimination
ordinance expand
inclusivity
By GENEVIEVE HUMMER
For the Daily
With a new revision to Ann
Arbor's Non-Discrimination
Ordinance, the City Council is
aiming to extend legal protec-
tions to a broader spectrum of
the city's residents,
The Council approved a
revamped ordinance Monday
that includes provisions for
gender expression and iden-
tity, survivors of domestic vio-
lence, political beliefs, genetic
information, arrest record and
familial status.
Councilmember Chris-
topher Taylor (D-Ward 3)
applauded the city's Human
Rights Commission for their
commitment to improving the
existing ordinance.
"It has been an example of
a commiission doing right and
doing good, so thank you,"
Taylor said at Monday's meet-
ing. "These changes, I believe,
reflect Ann Arbor's values of
openness and tolerance and
will constitute a great step for-
ward for us."
Councilmember Sumi Kai-
lasapathy (D-Ward 1), the
Council's liaison on the city's

Human Rights Commission,
said the commission was moti-
vated to revise the existing
ordinance because of a techni-
cal flaw.
The city's original Non-
Discrimination Ordinance
was passed in 1972 and later
became one of the first in the
state to include protections for
sexual orientation and.gender
expression.
The original ordinance
also provided for a city direc-
tor of human rights to oversee
human rights investigations,
but such a position doesn't cur-
rently exist. The commission
wanted to clarify the language
so future investigations can be
managed more efficiently. The
new ordinance states that the
Human Rights Commission
is responsible for overseeing
these investigations.
Ann Arbor's ordinance is
now more comprehensive than
similar legislation in Berke-
ley, Calif., Boulder, Colo. and
Austin, Texas. The ordinances
in these college towns afford
protections for race, color,
religion, sexual orientation,
gender, age and ancestry. How-
ever, they do not include provi-
sions for survivors of domestic
violence, members of the mili-
tary, an individual's political
beliefs or arrest record, and do
not differentiate between gen-
der identity and gender expres-
sion.

Closed forum
creates safe space to
exchange personal
experiences
By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR
Daily StaffReporter
Developing an inclusive and
supportive space for those who
have had one or more abortions
in their lifetime isn't easy. But, on
Thursday evening, the Abortion
Speak Out did just that.
The "1 in 3" Abortion Speak
Out gave University students,
faculty and staff the oppor-
tunity to share their personal

experiences with reproductive
choices. In its second year, the
gender-inclusive event allowed
any speaker to either share his or
her story directly or have it read
anonymously during the hour.
"We need a space that isn't
about shame," said award-win-
ning slam poet Sonya Renee as
she introduced a series of per-
formances that would transform
the Michigan Union's Pendleton
Room into this venue.
Renee, founder of the "The
Body Is Not An Apology" move-
ment, began the evening by
relaying reproductive justice
messages through spoken word
and poetry. She said the goal
was to create a space of "joy and
acceptance for people who will

come and share this evening."
"This is less about a show than
it is about a truth-telling session,
which is ritual, which is cere-
mony in my community," Renee
added.
To maintain respect in the
room throughout the event,
members of Students for Choice
recited rules for the audience to
follow once the eventbegan: Only
those who have had an abor-
tion were allowed to speak, and
speakers were advised to avoid
making generalizations about
abortion. All stories were also to
be kept confidential. Social work
volunteers were available after
the event to speak to attendees.
One by one, people walked

Changes impact

crime classification
By MAX RADWIN
Daily StaffReporter
College campuses should be
safer come July, when new feder-
al rules governing campus crime

reporting are set to go into effect.
The U.S. Department of Edu-
cation announced final rules last
Friday for new provisions to the
Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Cam-
pus Security Policy and Cam-
pus Crime Statistics Act, which
ensures that universities comply
with certain campus safety and
security policies. The revisions
were enacted as part of the Vio-
lence Against Women Reautho-
rization Act in Congress, which
included changes to the Clery Act.

"I am proud to say that now,
teens and young adults will have
better access to prevention and
intervention programs to help
break the cycle of violence around
the country," said Valerie Jarrett,
senior adviser and assistant to the
president for intergovernmental
affairs and public engagement
and chair of the White House
Council on Women and Girls, on
the White House Blog.
The Clery Act requires uni-
versities that receive financial
aid funding from the federal gov-
ernment to create and follow a
set of policies regarding student
safety. For example, a university
must publish an annual security
report, keep a public crime log,
post crime statistics, develop pro-
cedures for emergency situations
and prepare to handle reports of
missing students, among other
policies laid out in an almost 300-
page Clery Act handbook.
Effective July 1, 2015, the
changes include five additions
to the law. Universities will be
required to: record incidents
of stalking based on the loca-
tion where stalking took place
or the location where the vic-
tim first realized he or she was
being stalked; include gender
identity and national origin as
categories of bias that serve as
hate crimes; describe the type of
disciplinary action taken against
people who have allegedly com-
mitted domestic and dating vio-
lence, sexual assault or stalking;
include policies for preventing
dating violence in their annual
safety reports; and provide the
accuser and the accused with the
same opportunities during disci-
plinary committees.
Diane Brown, spokeswoman
for the University's Division of
Public Safety and Security, said it
won't be difficult for the Univer-
sity to make some of these chang-
es since it already had many of
the new requirements in place as
recently as Fall 2013, when the
University's sexual misconduct
policy was updated - includ-

Bowman characterized
energy prices as one of the
most important policy issues
for the United States because
of its significance to the econ
omy both for families and busi
nesses.
"What people need to under-
stand is that if your businesses
are paying a high amount for
energy, they have less money,
to grow, to hire new people and
to give the existing employees
wages and benefits," he said.
"Energy policy is our life-
blood."
Bowman added that he's
not opposed to exploring and
supporting wind and solar
energy, but decried a focus on
switching to them entirely. He
also said to keep prices down
he would look to coal as well
as hydroelectric and nuclear
energy sources.
"There's no reason to
demonize the existing energy
plants today, like the coal-
burning plants," Bowman
said. "I think we've been very
blessed in this country with an
incredible amount of coal."

No formal polls have been
conducted for the race, but
most predict Dingell will win
due to her position as the Dem-
ocratic nominee in a histori-

campaign does not have the
money or the name recogni-
tion to match his opponent, a
fact he has acknowledged.
"We know the district is

The first thing Bowman
wants to make clear is he's not
a Dingell.
Collectively, the Dingells
have held a seat in the House for
the past 81 years, through John
Dingell's service and through
his father, John D. Dingell, Sr.,
before him. Bowman has run
on the platform of ending the
"Dingell dynasty" and bringing
a fresh perspective to Washing-
ton.
"It's no fault of the individu-
al, but I think that if you're in
Congress for a long time you
completely lose the ability to
connect with what goes on each
andevery day," he said.
He added that his campaign
is not about partisanship in
general. He said he's against
family legacies in politics,
whether it's a Clinton, a Dingell
or a Bush.

Healthcare
Bowman has also made health
care, specifically his opposition
to the Affordable Care Act, a
policy focus. He pointed an eco-
nomic issue - the requirement
for businesses with 50 or more
employees to offer health insur-
ance to their workers if they
work 30 or more hours per week
- as the basis for his concern.
"For the first time in history,
the Affordable Care Act desig-
nates full-time employment as
30 hours a week or more," he
said. "And so businesses are not
willing to work their employees
more than 29 hours a week. So
this is a law, a bill, that actually
encourages unemployment, and
it encourages part-time employ-
ment, which is not beneficial to
the middle-income people in the
United States, or the working
families in the United States."

The number of student ticket
sales dropped from about 19,000
in 2013 to about 12,000 in 2014,
creating a noticeably smaller stu-
dent section.
As has been the policy in pre-
vious years, the Athletic Depart-

packages to every student who
equests one for the upcom-
ing season. Citing the lower
prices and a home schedule that
includes games against Ohio
State and Michigan State, Hunter

chief marketing officer, said he
hopes the student section will
rebound to between 18,000 and
20,000 people next fall.

ORDINANCE
From Page 1
During the public hearing at
Monday's meeting, local organi-
zations voiced their support for
the new ordinance. A represen-
tative from SafeHouse, a group
that provides support for sur-
vivors of domestic violence and
*exual assault, was among those
in attendance.
Barbara Niess-May, execu-
tive director of SafeHouse, said
she was thrilled with the new
ordinance. Victims of domes-
tic violence, sexual assault and
stalking are often dismissed from
jobs, restaurants and businesses
because of their attacker's behav-
ior, Niess-May said in an inter-
viewwith The Michigan Daily.
The wider impact of the
ordinance is also important to
the organization, which works
closely with the local LGBTQ
community.
"It's not just about one sliver
of society, it's about its entirety,"
Niess-May said.
Kailasapathy said Ann Arbor
is hoping to set an example for
the state of Michigan through
the revised ordinance. The
state's anti-discrimination leg-

saw that significant dropoff from
the previous year," Brandon said.
"Clearly, that was a strong message
to us that, 'Hey, something is amiss
that we need to address'"
Student seating will be
assigned based on attendance
at this season's games, as was
announced this spring. The pol-
icy rewards students who attend
at least six games this fall and
arrive more than 20 minutes
before kickoff with better seats
in 2015. The policy change comes
after a shift to a General Admis-
sion model prior to the 2013 sea-
son, which was met with uproar
by the student body.
The remainder of the students
will be organized based on class
ranking.
Dishell said he and Brandon,
along with Lochmann and CSG
Vice President Emily Lustig, an
LSA senior, have been in talks
for the past "two or three weeks"
about improving the student sec-
tion.

Dishell, who originally devel-
oped the CSG survey, worked to
add questions and feedback from
Brandon before sending it out
to students Oct. 10. According
to Dishell, 5,802 individuals -
roughly 12 percent of the student
body - filled out the survey. And
since then, the group has worked
"night and day" to implement a
new policy.
"This was strictly (in conjunc-
tion) with students," Dishell said.
"This is really us being us. I
don't know of another school
who's lowering ticket prices 40
percent," Brandon added.
The plan also plans to lower
the ticket processing fee from $15
to $10 while includingthe T-shirt
for students in the cost of the
ticket package - a $15 value.
"Michigan football is such a
core component (of the Univer-
sity experience) because there's
no other experience on campus
that more students participate in
at one time," Dishell said.

where you can jump into a new
organization. You can see some-

one on stage and say, 'I want to
do that.'"
Though the event was focused
in part on Michigan's upcoming
game against Michigan State
and included a speech from
Michigan football coach Brady
Hoke, the Athletic Department
has been subject to vocal criti-
cism in recent weeks.
Many students railed against
Hoke for putting sophomore
quarterback Shane Morris back
in Michigan's Sept. 27 football
game against Minnesota after
he sustained a "probable, mild
concussion," and later against
Athletic Department officials

for failing to provide adequate
communication about the inci-
dent.
Borger said he hopes the rally
will take place again next year
and continue increasing morale
and pride at the University.
"We've been working so hard
just for tonight so we always
hope someone will carry it for-
ward," Borger said. "We felt that
this year was particularly impor-
tant to get people to step up and
increase University morale and
take pride to be here. Yesterday,
the block 'M' got painted green,
and we can't let that happen. Not
here, not at my University."

islation, the Elliott-Larsen Civil
Rights Act, does not include
protections for sexual orienta-
tion, gender identity and gen-
der expression. However, it was
amended in 2009 to increase
protections for pregnant
employees.
State Rep. Adam Zemke (D-
Ann Arbor) acknowledged the
state's shortcomings in a state-
ment read by Taylor at Monday's
meeting.
"I would love to stand before
you today and say that a com-
prehensive local ordinance is
unnecessary because the state
has included all persons regard-
less of sexual orientation, gen-
der expression or identity under
the protection afforded by the
Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act,"
Zemke wrote. "That would
be the right thing to do for all
Michiganders, however, that is
not yet the case."
Political beliefs are another
protection many would like to
see added to state legislation.
In an interview with the Daily,
Michael Steinberg, legal direc-
tor for the American Civil Lib-
erties Union in Michigan, said
an Ann Arbor doctor was fired
a few years ago because she
was an activist for Palestinian
rights. Steinberg said he hopes

state lawmakers will realize the
importance of protecting people
of all political views.
"Ann Arbor is not alone; sev-
eral states have political beliefs
protected in their civil rights
laws - California, Colorado,
Connecticut, South Dakota and
Louisiana, just to name a few,"
Steinberg said. "It isn't radical
or out of the ordinary."
He added that the ordinance
is especially relevant to Ann
Arbor. Because the town is home
to one of the nation's preeminent
universities, the right to freely
exchange ideas is important.
William Hampton, president
of the Ann Arbor chapter of the
National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People,
praised the Council for the work
they did to improve the ordi-
nance and noted Ann Arbor's
longstanding tradition of social
progress.
"It showed a lot of courage to
have a human rights ordinance
in the 1970s, and we did," he
said.
However, Hampton added
that without enforcement, the
new ordinance will be mean-
ingless. He hopes that if it is
enforced it will encourage com-
munity members to value and
celebrate diversity.

al views on bodily autonomy.
LSA freshman Cora Sharp said
she attended the event to support

she believes she would have made

pregnant in similar situations.
"I want people to understand

Authorities
stock riot gear in
anticipation of
civil unrest
FERGUSON, Mo. (AP) - Mis-
souri police have been brushing
up on constitutional rights and
stocking up on riot gear to pre-
pare for a grand jury's decision
about whether to charge a white
police officer who fatally shot a
black 18-year-old in suburban
St. Louis.
The preparations are aimed
at avoiding a renewed outbreak
of violence during the poten-
tially large demonstrations that
could follow an announcement
of whether Ferguson police
officer Darren Wilson will face
a criminal trial for the Aug. 9
death of Michael Brown.
Police and protesters have
repeatedly clashed since the
shooting, which prompted a
national conversation about race
and police tactics. Images of
officers in riot gear and armored
vehicles confronting protesters
have drawn widespread criti-
cism.
Many protesters want Dar-'
ren Wilson indicted for mur-
der. Grand jury proceedings
are secret, but legal analysts

say recently leaked informa-
tion about Wilson's testimony to
investigators may be an attempt
to prepare the public for the
possibility that he might not be
charged.
The decision could be made
public within the next month.
In the meantime, law offi-
cers have adjusted their tactics
for interacting more peacefully
with protesters while also hon-
ing their procedures for quick,
widespread arrests. They plan
to have a large contingent of
officers at the ready, but have
been meeting with clergy, com-
munity leaders and students in
hopes of building relationships
that could ease tensions on the
streets.
"I know there's a lot of anxi-
ety, there's a lot of fear, anticipa-
tion" about that announcement,
said Missouri State Highway
Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who
was put in charge of security
in Ferguson in the days after
Brown was killed and is now
part of a coordinated command
with local police. But "I have a
lot of hope."
Law enforcement officers
expect to receive at least a
day's notice before a grand jury
announcement. That should
provide time for them to exe-
cute security plans but may also
allow demonstrators to prepare.

"The moment I learn that
there is, in fact, a non-indict-
ment, then there's going to be
an organized protest," said Eric
Vickers, a black St. Louis attor-
ney and civil rights activist.
Brown was unarmed when
Wilson encountered him walk-
ing in the street with a friend.
A scuffle ensued and Brown
was shot multiple times. Wit-
ness accounts of what happened
varied, with some people saying
they saw Brown raise his hands
as if in surrender.
Wilson told investigators
he felt threatened while fight-
ing with Brown from inside a
police SUV, where an initial
gunshot was fired, accord-
ing to information provided to
several news outlets by people
described as familiar with the
investigation, but otherwise
not identified. After Brown fled
the vehicle, Wilson said Brown
turned around in threatening
manner, prompting the officer
to fire the fatal shots, according
to those accounts of his testi-
mony.
Wilson's description of events
was leaked recently, as was an
autopsy report that showed
Brown had marijuana in his sys-
tem and was shot in the hand at
close range. Wilson has alleged
Brown was trying to grab his
gun in the SUV.


because they wanted to help
enhance his public presence,
among other reasons.
"He's a really fantastic speak-
er and he's also in an incredibly
important race that doesn't get a
lot of attention because it is a non-
partisan race and on the back of
the ballot," he said.
Bernstein said a major problem
facing the Democratic Party in
Michigan is the fact that 35 per-
cent of Democratic voters do not
complete the entire ballot. The
Supreme Court race is a "down-
ballot issue," Bernstein said, and
appears on the back of the physi-
cal ballot.
Bernstein also referenced his
experience finishing 18 mara-
thons and an Ironman Triathlon.
"Athletics helps to shatter a lot
of stereotypes and change a lot of
perceptions people have of peo-
ple with disabilities and special
needs," he said.
Music, Theatre & Dance
freshman Samuel Koeppe
attended the event to support
Bernstein's efforts on behalf of
the disabled.
"Both of my parents work for
kids with disabilities, so activism
for disabilities has always been
present in my life and I think it's
a very important topic to be dis-

cussed," he said. "So many people
with disabilities have a hard time
finding good education and hope-
fully he can open up doors to
make it more accessible."
Bernstein discussed the
Supreme Court justice election
process, generally voicing his
support for it but identifying one
main flaw. Candidates are nomi-
nated by their respective parties,
but the race is billed as non-par-
tisan and candidates are elected
rather than appointed. He said
the blurred partisan lines in the
election can lead to impropriety
in the campaign process.
"It is critical that you go out
and spend time with voters," he
said. "The one problem that has to
be changed is dark money. PACs
can pour tremendous amounts of
money into these races and you
don't know where that money is
coming from."
Bernstein also added that
social media will be the party's
greatest asset.
"Social media changes how
these elections are fought," he
said. "The one chance that we
have as Democrats is the fact
that even though we're going to
get outspent, we have energy and
spirit, and we are going to out-
work them."

Stressing the small stuff
Basic mental health services can help the 'U' prevent future crises
n Oct. 15, University Health Service published the
National Health Assessment Survey, a study that looks
at general health indicators of the student body. The
results of this survey provide a useful tool for identifying positive
and negative health trends of University students. The Michigan
Daily Editorial Board has isolated three main topics for analysis:
Alcohol and drug abuse, mental health, and sexual health and
relationships. This editorial focuses on the mental health of the
student body.

Unified by faith or bound by obligation?

ver the summer, as I attempt-
ed to clean out my room and
sift through the multitude
of half-scribbled-
in journals I've
kept from my early
years, I found one
from the year 2000.
In simple phrasing
and rudimentary
words, my 7-year-
old self detailed the A
trip my family took ABBY
to Israel. "Me and
my sisters got off
the plane and then
we kissed the ground," it reads. "My
dad says it is holy."
What I remember now from that
trip is not that it was holy, but rather
that I enjoyed picking oranges from
trees and eating my distant Aunt
Shoshi's Israeli cheesecake. I haven't
been back since, and frankly, the main
reason I would return is to claim my
free Birthright trip.
I've struggled with my Judaism
for a long time. Growing up, instead
of joining the recreational soccer
team that met on Saturdays, I went
to synagogue. My dad, after many
years of attending the tightly knit
prayer group called Havurah, became
central to the community. Every other
Saturday, my sisters and I joined him
to sing and chant antiquated Hebrew
words. No prayer ever resonated with
me, and during the silent portion of
the service, when Jews individually
spoke to God, I watched the clock tick
and imagined the mounds of bagels
that awaited me at the post-service
reception. During the sermon portion
of the service, where one person led a
discussion about that week's biblical
text, I'd sometimes raise my hand to
ask a question or provide an insight.
Myparticipationwaspurelymotivated
by the desire to intellectually impress
my father and his peers, rather than
comment onthetext at large.
Despite my inability to connect
with Judaism spiritually, at the age
of eight I started attending Camp
Ramah, a summer camp with con-
servative Jewish values. While many
of my strongest friendships were
formed during my summers at camp,
I never feltparticularly attached to the
praying, the Jewish learning or the
Jewish-themed activities I was forced
to partake in. A fun free-time activ-
ity like jazzercise turned into Jewish
jazzercise, and games in the lake were
labeled alongthe lines of, take a splash
in Moses'parted sea! It felt almost cult-
ish. Still, I held hands with my friends

on Friday nights, singing songs that
welcomed the Sabbath, and acknowl-
edged the fact that our culture brought
us together in a meaningful way. But,
when campers' eyes welled up with
tears as we sang the solemn Hebrew
melodies, I felt absolutely nothing.
Coming to college, I felt liberated in
that I could beginto formulate my own
Jewish identity without my family's
influence. I remember that att16, one of
my sisters told me she'd be extremely
disappointed in me if I didn't marry
someone Jewish. Recently, when I
posed the question to my dad whether
or not he'd prefer me to marry a,
Jewish woman or a Christian man, he
responded, "Jewish woman. Ha! Look
at how progressive Iam."
As an incomingfreshman, however,
the only people I knew were, unsur-
prisingly, Jewish kids from Camp
Ramah. While I endlessly appreci-
ate the guidance they gave me as a
stumbling, clueless freshman, they
themselves prescribed to the life of the
typical Jewish student. Following in
their footsteps alongside other fresh-
men I knew from the Ramah sphere, I
attended Friday night dinners at Hil-
lel and joined a Jewish sorority. The
only way I justified it was by repeat-
ing to myself and everyone around me
that Friday night dinner at Hillel was
free, and my sorority was made up
of the "chill" Jewish girls. But after a
month's deliberation and a night with
my head buried in the toilet during
a sorority event, I quit and stopped
attending Jewish events entirely.
My rejection of the mainstream
Jewish institutions at the University,
which are by no means the only
Jewish institutions, was perceived as
a rejection of my Judaism altogether.
When I admitted to not having
attended High Holy Day services
at Hillel, my dad replied with a sigh
and said, "I've failed you as a Jewish
educator." Last fall, I ran into a kid
I'd known during my freshman year,
another Camp Ramah alum, and he
asked, "So you're basically not into
being Jewish anymore, right?"
Even more problematic was that as
I drifted away from the social institu-
tions that were so inextricably linked
to Judaism, I began to drift toward
very left-wing thinkers who per-
ceived religious Jews to be Zionists,
and Zionists to be oppressors. Last
December, when the pro-Palestinian
student group, Students Allied for
Freedom and Equality, put mock evic-
tion notices in residence halls in order
to highlight the evictions of Palestin-
ians from their homes, I was outraged

- not because of their radical perfor-
mance of activism, but because of the
attitude members of Hillel took. Jew-
ish students felt personally victim-
ized, which I'm not discrediting, but
suddenly the situation took a complete
180. No longer was the conversation
centered around the Palestinian refu-
gee situation, but on how Jewish kids
attending the University of Michigan
felt uncomfortable. Well, wasn't that
the point? When Jews dip parsley into
salt water during Passover to sym-
bolically taste our enslaved ancestors'
tears, isn't the point to feel sad and
uncomfortable? Or do Jews only sym-
pathize with our own kind?
This summer, during Israel's
ground assault in Gaza following the
discovery of Hamas' tunnels, a Jewish
student at the University published
an article challenging the intentions
of left-leaning Jews, arguing that all
Jews should without questionsupport
Israel in its time of need. But, by
that same logic, Palestinians should
blindly follow Hamas, a definitive
terrorist group, because they are the
authority in power. The pointis not to
not support Israel, because in reality,
in this case I believe the military
action taken by Israel was warranted.
Instead, the point is to think critically
and never blindly follow something
because of your hereditary, religious
or cultural roots. A unifying culture
can't justify perpetuated sameness.
I am Jewish. Although I don't feel
spiritually connected to prayer, have
never spokenwith God other than dur-
ing a shroom trip, and don't feel a deep
bond to Israel, I am Jewish. I am proud
ofthecultureJudaismhascreatedand
developed, the moral code it promotes,
the level of perseverance amidst
endless persecution that Jews have
endured. But I am both pro-Israel and
pro-Palestine. I am disturbed by the
homogeneity of Jewish institutions,
especially those here on campus, that
subsequently produce homogenous,
uncontested thought. I am unwill-
ing to subscribe to the archaic belief
that marrying within my tribe is the
only way for marital success. But most
importantly, as a Jew, I will never let
my religion identify me too completer
ly, so much so as to isolate me fromthe
amazing souls that don't happen to be
Jewish. And, as I continue forward, I
will tryto stop rejecting aspects of my
Judaism, but rather use them in a way
that religion should be used:as aguide
to becoming a better person.

The University used the NCHA guidelines
to survey students covering about 30
different factors affecting academic
performance. Results indicated that stress
and anxiety were the two leading factors that
impeded students' academic performances.
Among undergraduate students, 31 percent
of respondents indicated stress as a factor
affecting their academic performance, and 22
percent reported being affected by anxiety.
These results show a growth from 2010
numbers of 25 and 17 percent, respectively.
Eighteen and 14 percent of graduate student
respondents said stress and anxiety affected
their academic performance.
While these statistics are near the
American College Health Association's
2013 national averages of 27.9 percent and
19.7 percent for stress and anxiety, these
concerning numbers suggest the start of
an upward trend and and should be taken
seriously by University administrators.
The University can begin by further pro-
moting the tuition-funded services offered
through Counseling and Psychological Ser-
vices, located on the third floor of the Michi-
gan Union. Though CAPS has faced criticism
from students in the past, CAPS administra-
tors have revamped its services in order to
better accommodate students. Most com-
mendably, the wait time for an appointment
decreased from a period of one to three weeks
to a period of one to three days.

"What we, as a staff, listened to was this
critique that the wait for CAPS was too long.
We overhauled the old system in response. We
had to completely change our mindset," CAPS
Director Todd Sevig said in an interview
with the Daily. With the consideration
of student input in its expansion and the
implementation of innovative programs,
such as the awareness events at the Michigan
Theater, other University units must actively
help promote CAPS' endeavors and help
students become more aware of its services.
Furthermore, University promotion of
student-led initiatives on campus in support of
mental health will encourage students to take
advantage of available services by spreading
awareness and destigmatizing their use. For
example, the Central Student Government's
Wolverine Support Network is an initiative
in which student mentors, who are trained by
CAPS in a three-day retreat, will meet weekly
to help students work through their issues
beginning in January 2015.
Reports of stress and anxiety may appear
to be common, everyday challenges, and
thus undeserving of such attention. But
willful disregard for basic mental health
will certainly lead to larger and more
serious disorders that can have devastating
effects. By working to lower the stress and
anxiety levels of its students, the University
can prevent future cost and illness while
improving students' daily lives.

Actions not keeping up with awareness

According to findings from a new U-M
Sustainability Cultural Indicators Program
report, most U-M faculty, students, and staff
have boosted their knowledge about how to
be more sustainable, particularly in the areas
of foods and waste prevention. However,
behavior in these areas has remained essen-
tially the same.
SCIP is a collaborative effort between
U-M's Graham Sustainability Institute and
the Institute for Social Research, with support
from the Office of the Provost. Launched in
2012 to track "sustainability culture" on the
Ann Arbor campus, SCIP uses annual surveys
to measure and evaluate changes and progress
over time. The survey data inform a set of
sustainability indicators in four key categories:
climate action, waste prevention, healthy
environments and community awareness
- aligning directly with the University's
campus sustainability goal areas. The second-
year SCIP report reflects responses from
4,700 faculty, students, and staff in 2013,
and compares those results to benchmarks
established in 2012.
"To achieve its ambitious campus goals,
the University prioritized stakeholder
engagement, education, and evaluation
strategies toward a campus-wide ethic of
sustainability", said Professor Don Scavia,
special counsel to the U-M president for
sustainability and director of the Graham
Institute. "SCIP is a critical tool to assess
sustainability behaviors throughout our
campus community, and to inform strategies
for improvingthem over time."
The 105-page SCIP report covers findings
on people's levels of awareness, behaviors, and
commitment to sustainability, and an easy-to-
read "Sustainability Indicators Highlights"
sheet outlines statistically significant increas-
es and decreases between 2012 and 2013.
A promising outcome is that more
indicators went up than down from 2012 to
2013, particularly in the area of community
awareness. However, while most people
on campus said they were committed to
sustainability in both years, key sustainability
behavior indicators for climate action, waste
prevention, and healthy environments all
remained unchanged.
"It's an important stride that people know
more about sustainability, and that shows
success in terms of on-campus education
and outreach programs," said the Graham
Institute's John Callewaert, co-principal

investigator on the initiative with Robert W.
Marans from ISR. "Now, we just need to see
higher levels of awareness translated into
more sustainable behaviors."
To ensure the SCIP findings are put to
good use, the co-Pi's are distributing and
discussing the data and results with multiple
units on campus. For example, they have met
with U-M's Office of Campus Sustainability,
Sustainable Computing, Athletics, the North
Campus Sustainability Initiative, Parking &
Transportation Services, and several others.
They're also collaborating with the Planet
Blue Ambassador Program, which educates
and engages U-M faculty, students, and staff
in sustainability on campus.
"SCIP has brought people together in
ways never seen before," said Kevin Morgan,
regional energy manager for U-M Planet Blue
Operations Team, who is using the SCIP data
to plan energy conservation efforts across
campus. "To meet campus goals, it's important
to have those conversations."
Callewaert elaborates: "The main goal of
SCIP is to inform U-M administrators and
others responsible for day-to-day operations
of the University. So it's wonderful to see so
many decision makers across campus already
starting to put the data to good use."
With an invitation letter from U-M
President Mark Schlissel, ISR will send third-
year surveys to a cross-section of the campus
community in October and November. For the
SCIP effort to be most impactful, data must
be collected over several years to effectively
assess changes and trends over time.
"The web survey takes only about 15
minutes to complete," said Marans. "I urge
everyone who receives it through e-mail to
complete it right away. Sustainability is a top
priority for the University, and the survey
feedback we receive from our students, staff,
and faculty is critical in understanding how
we're doing and where we should be going."

you want to do more to help the University to
meet its campus sustainability goals, become

The trouble with
Olivia and Fitz

The confusing
polites of ABC's hot
* drama, 'Scandal'
By CHLOE GILKE
Daily TV/New Media Editor
"Scandal" is the most
confusing show on television.
I'm not talking about the
constant plot twists, the
characters' ever-changing
moral standing (White hat's
off! White hat's back on!)
or even about whatever's
going on in the inscrutable
mind of Mellie Grant. The
most confusing thing about
'"Scandal" is how one little
musical motif makes me
accept (hell, even actively
love) an abusive and dangerous
relationship.
As soon as those first
notes of "The Light" by The
Album Leaf play, all bets are
off for me. I can go from a
discerning and classy critic
lady to a full-blown Fitz and
Olivia shipper in the blink of
a teary eye. Something about
the minimalist, somber piano
and the romantic melody
perfectly captures a love that
isn't meant to be, the notes
*somehow communicating the
love between a man who's
emotionally unavailable and
the woman who didn't mean to
fall for him. Every time it plays,
the tune brings with it the
memory of all the other times
it's been played, the cadence of
their entire relationship since
that time on the campaign bus.
It's powerful stuff, the kind
that makes you stop thinking
about the toxic codependency
that serves as the foundation
of their love and just revel in
the beauty of "one minute" of
a 'gorgeous song and a pairing
that appears just as gorgeous.
But the thing is, Olitz isn't
gorgeous. While the first
and second seasons built Fitz
and Olivia up as some idyllic
dream couple, the more recent
seasons have been all about
breaking the illusion that Olitz
is meant to be. Fitz is no longer
the sensitive, misguided man
we met in the first episode.
He's a scotch-guzzling,
snarling, volatile man who
grabs and pushes and insults
the women in his life. While

the Fitz of the past maintained
some idealism (before he knew
his presidency was built on a
lie and a rigged election), that
innocence is long gone ever
since he, you know, smothered
an elderly Supreme Court
justice to death with a pillow.
I do appreciate a good anti-
hero, so this moral ambiguity
alone isn't a problem. But what
is troubling is that Fitz lets
this violence bleed into his
relationship with Olivia. Fitz
makes romantic promises -
he vows to move to Vermont
and leave Mellie and start a
beautiful, low-profile life with
Olivia as soon as his term is
over - but his kind gestures
stop as soon as "The Light"
turns off. He's got an ugly
sense of possession for Olivia,
and hires a professional spy to
keep tabs on her while he pouts
and pours himself another
scotch. He tries to break up
every relationship between
Olivia and another man, with
no concern for whether she's
happy or consents to dragged
back home by her concerned
lover.
In the latest episode, "Like
Father, Like Daughter," Olitz
finally reunites after months
apart while she was in hiding
with Jake. Their meeting goes
exactly how one would expect
from Fitz and Olivia. He
starts by saying, "I'm the most
powerful man in the world,"
a reminder to Liv (and the
audience) that he's a president
not to be fucked with. To
boot, all the doors in the room
are closed, and he's circling
around Olivia like a hungry
piranha. He eventually goes up
to her and grabs her by the ass,
pushing his body against hers
with zero regard for consent.
After a summer's vacation
from Olitz, I almost forgot
that an integral part of their
relationship is based on non-
consensual physical contact,
but this scene is a great
reminder of what we're in for.
He augments the implication
of physical abuse by saying
"Don't ever leave me again,"
suggesting to Olivia that
her purpose is only to serve
his wants and needs and to
ignore her own personal
safety. To say the least, it's
not a romantic moment. I feel
physically sick watching the

scene, but then "Scandal" goes
ahead and fucks everything up
and turns me into a shameful,
Olitz-loving puddle of tears.
Yup, "The Light" again. In
a sequence that's otherwise
chilling in its portrayal of
emotional manipulation and
dysfunction, one musical piece
transforms the whole thing
into pure romance. One minute
he's unbuttoning her jacket
while she looks on helplessly,
and the next their bodies are
close, the passion no longer
one-sided. Olivia is the one
true love of Fitz's life, and he's
not exaggerating when he says
that he'd die if she ever went
away from him again. She's the
one thing that's keeping him
sane in his insane and tragic
life.
The song brings with it the
memory of the "one minute"
scene from season one's "The
Trail," in which Fitz requests
a single untainted minute in
which he could enjoy Olivia's
company before he had to
go back to the White House.
In these sixty seconds, he
could pretend he wasn't
the President and Olivia's
apartment was theirs, he could
put his arms around her and
lean in and dream of a life
where they could actually be
together.
"Scandal" plays a cruel and
confusing trick on fans now.
"The Light" still plays during
every Fitz and Olivia scene, but
the nature of their relationship
isn't as pure and idyllic as it
was for that "one minute."
Somehow, their relationship
has transitioned to the point
where Fitz can grab Liv by
the shoulders and push her
toward a wall, and "The Light"
still soars as a cue for us to see
this as another stolen, perfect
Olitz moment. It's especially
problematic, because as much
as I despise Fitz's entitlement
and rudeness and abuse, I'm
put right into Olivia's shoes,
and for one minute he becomes
Prince Charming again.
Romanticizing abuse is
particularly disturbing,
but even more so when the
audience is duped into their
relationship just as much as
the victim is. But let me just
sit down, listen to "The Light"
and stop thinking about all
this. Just for one minute.

funding of the Nicaraguan rebels
in the 1980s, part of the Reagan
administration's secret plan to
fund the group included using
profits from Nicaraguan cocaine

as Los Angeles.
However, when Webb ignores

The only problem with the
film is that the government

half of the plot description

While the price Webb paid for
his investigative journalism
serves as an integral part of the
story, it fails to match up to the,
scandal of a vocally anti-drug

administration that knowingly
allowed the sale of cocaine in the
United States. Simply put, the
film loses momentum instead of

While the many scenes of

default and

next episode. In its Season Two
premiere "About a Vasectomy,"
the Jason Katims ("Friday Night
Lights")-created comedy "About
a Boy" explores this common
exercise of the sitcom and what
happens when a character wants
to return to the status quo when
others have moved on.
Opening a few months after
where season one left off, "About
a Boy" finds protagonist Will
Freeman (David Walton, "New
Girl") living in New York with his
girlfriend Sam (Adrianne Palicki,
"Friday Night Lights"). Will still
struggles to adjust to life in the
city. Director Adam Davidson
("Community") shows his
troubles in an opening montage as
Will spends his day trying to find
the perfect asiago bagel. However,
Will's current situation of

spending his days doing whatever
he wants is interrupted as his only
source of income (royalties from a
song written 10 years ago) is taken
away.
To work out this situation,
Will goes on a brief visit to his
San Francisco home and reunites
with his neighbor, Fiona (Minnie
Driver, "Good Will Hunting")
and her son Marcus (Benjamin
Stockham, "1600 Penn"). Will
attempts to jump right back
into routine, giving Marcus a
conventional (albeit older) male
friend who lets him do things
his mother wouldn't let him.
However, the pair seem to have
accepted a reality without Will
while Will tries to go back to his
previous position by extending
his visit. Will's need to return to
the default is projected onto the
two as Will looks for problems to
solve and Fiona compares him to
an "arsonistfirefighter."
Will's discomfort with moving

issue that people face. Applying
that problem to a sitcom - where
the return to the norm is almost
always embraced - is effective,
but there are times when "About

it's enjoyable to see Will help out

far more provocative to see more
evidence that the mother and son
had moved on and Will was in
denial.
The destruction of the status

short subplot Will shares with

"Gary Unmarried"). In the first

'Hang Out' with a
fun new memoir

Stephen Wright was a consulting producer on the fourth season of 'Louie'
Wright discusses
Royal, Oak show

Academy Award
winning comedian
talks storied career
ByERIKAHARWOOD
SeniorArtsEditor
The story of Steven Wright's
rise to success is one of almost
comedy cliche. Back during
a time when
landing a gig Steven
on late night Wright
could turn
someone into Royal Oak
an overnight MUsIC
success, Theatre
Wright got his
big break on
"The Tonight
Show Starring Johnny Carson.".
This would have been a career-
altering performance for any
up and coming comedian. One
filled with high stakes, sweat-
inducing lights and nerves
- not whimsical butterflies
flitting around in your
stomach, but cold, unforgiving
nerves.
Wright's comedy dreams
started when he was a
teenager watching Carson,
and despite his anxiety and
the inherent stress that comes
with performing on television
for the first time, he managed
to stake his claim as a late
night mainstay. His deadpan
delivery and bizarre non
sequiturs were a refreshing
contrast against the brash
vulgarity of predecessors like
George Carlin and Richard
Pryor. Since his crucial set,
Wright has gone on to release
Grammy-nominated comedy
albums (I Have a Pony, I
Still Have a Pony), create an
Academy Award-winning short
film ("The Appointments of
Dennis Jennings") and most
recently, serve as a producer

on the Emmy Award-winning
"Louie."
Wright recently sat down
for a phone interview with
The Michigan Daily to discuss
his life in comedy and his
upcoming performance at the
Royal Oak Music Theatre this
Saturday.
"I got so nervous that I
wasn't nervous anymore,"
Wright said about his first
set on "The Tonight Show." "I
got numb. When I watched it,
when I was 14 or 15, it became
my fantasy, like, 'If I could go
on ("The Tonight Show"), that
would be amazing.' That was
the only thing I wanted to do
was to go on there ... It's still
the highlight of my career."
Decades later, Wright is still
making the rounds on late night
television. He's a frequent
guest on "The Late Late
Show with Craig Ferguson,"
which provides Wright with a
platform to exercise his not-so-
often-used improv skills.
"I never did that on the
other shows," he said. "It's
very interesting for me. It's fun
and it's different. (Ferguson) is
very trusting. He doesn't want
it to be set up ... He's one of the
fastest comedy minds I've ever
seen."
When Wright isn't seated
next to suited up talk show
hosts, he's traveling around
the country to perform stand
up, usually going a few weeks
at a time then returning home
for a break, which is much
different from the schedule
he maintained when he was
starting out.
"When I started in the clubs,
I would do it Thursday through
Sunday in Boston," he recalls.
"Then when I went on TV I
started traveling around the
country. I would be in comedy
clubs for weeks at a time, then
I went to theaters ... two weeks,


three weeks all in a row. I did
that for years and years and
years."
This isn't to say that Wright
has slowed down. While living
in New York, Wright became
friends with fellow stand up,
Louis C.K., who unexpectedly
asked him to be a consulting
producer for season four of
"Louie."
"It would be like if you asked
me if I wanted to open a bakery
in China with you," Wright
said. "You're not going to ask
me that are you?"
While he's not committed to
working on the next season of
"Louie," he'd love the chance to
work on the show again.
"It's amazing just using your
comedy mind in that way," he
said. "Because usually I do
write my own stand up and
perform it, I don't talk about it
with anyone. I just go out and
do it ... so it was interesting to
discuss all these things with
another comedian, a brilliant
comedian."
Regardless of whether he
continues to produce, Wright
will stick with what he knows
and loves best - stand up. And
for fans coming to the Royal
Oak show, they can expect the
same dry, nonsensical one-
liners that brought him there
all way from "The Tonight
Show" in 1982.
After decades in comedy
with more accomplishments
than most can dream of, it's
hard to imagine that there's
much territory left for Wright
to conquer. But in the midst
of his stand up, late night
appearances and potential
producing, he may have finally
found something he hasn't
done yet.
"I'd like to join the Air
Force."
Let's just hope he's as good a
pilot as he is a comic.

In Josh Sundquist's ("Just

book of true stories - "We

- he revisits his failed
relationships, or rather, near-
relationships. From eighth
grade to high school to his

cancer survivor, amputee,

speaker and YouTube
star - guides the reader
through the face-in-hand
awkwardness of adolescence
to the head-banging-against-

The book operates as

an excellent and competitive
*league," said Michigan coach
Chaka Daley.
With a rough start to the
season, Michigan (2-1-2 Big
Ten, 4-6-3 overall) finds itself
one point above seventh-place
Indiana, but a win could very
well set them up for a title
charge.
- "We shouldn't look too much
at the record," Daley said. "We
need to keep our minds right and
look at what we can still achieve."
. Having moved to a new

possession-based style of play
this season, it has taken time
for the players to grow into the
new system. But after a rough
first month, the team has shown
signs of improvement as it grows
into its new soccer philosophy.
With a 1-1-1 record against
ranked teams, Michigan has
fared much better against
opponents that try to win the
ball back as soon as possible,
and look to attack regularly. It
struggles against teams that sit
back and "park the bus."
The Wolverines press high up
the pitch and almost always have
the lion's share of possession.
For all their dominance in the
middle ofthe pitch,they struggle
to create chances. And when
these chances do come, they fail
to find the net. Michigan has
scored 12 goals in 14 games -
the only team scoring less than a
goal a game in the Big Ten.
The Hoosiers, on the other
hand, have no problem scoring
goals, and have already bagged
21 this season - one behind
league-leader Penn State.
Indiana's top scorer is Femi
Hollinger-Janzen with four
goals, but it has three more
players with three goals each,
highlighting the Hoosiers'
flexibility and depth. The
Wolverines, in contrast, have
had half their goals scored by
redshirt junior forward Colin
McAtee, who stands third in the
scoring charts having played one
game fewer than the players in
second and first.
Provided other results go its
way, Michigan could find itself
in third place by the end of the
weekend. Sunday afternoon
promises 90 minutes of suspense
and action.

The Michigan hockey team's
first weekend-long road trip
of the year won't be to an
unfamiliar location.
As the 14th-ranked Wolverines
(1-2) head to Massachusetts this
weekend, Michigan coach Red
Berenson and associate coach
Billy Powers will find themselves
immersed in nostalgia. Berenson
played his first NHL game at the
old Boston Garden on St. Patrick's
Day in 1962. Powers spent his
childhood and adolescence just
outside Boston in Somerville,
Massachusetts.
While the memories of trips
to Boston will resonate in both
Berenson and Powers' minds,
there won't be much time to
reminisce about the past as
Michigan will be tested against a
pair of ranked foes. Friday's game
pits the Wolverines against No.
7 UMass-Lowell (2-0-1) before
they travel, to No. 12 Boston
University (1-0) on Saturday.
"We're looking to make some
memories rather than look back
on memories," Berenson said.
Just traveling to UMass-
Lowell will be a new experience,
as Friday's matchup marks
the first time Michigan will
play the River Hawks on the
road. The Wolverines are
expecting a raucous crowd at
the Paul E. Tsongas Center with
homecoming weekend looming.
"They've got everything
set up for them to have a great
crowd and a great environment,"
Berenson said. "And we've got to
go in and be a spoiler."
Michigan leads the all-time
series against UMass-Lowell,
2-1, with the most recent defeat
coming in a 2-1 loss at Yost Ice
Arena in 2013.
In a weekend split against
New Hampshire last weekend,

goal and struggled to get pucks
through to the net from the
blue line. Cleaning up those
components and improving a
struggling special teams unit
will be of the utmost importance
if the Wolverines are to return
home unscathed.
Michigan is 0-for-9 on the
power play in three games, and
it has conceded a shorthanded
goal in two of those. Meanwhile,
the penalty-killing unit hasn't
shined either. It has allowed
two goals in nine opportunities,
despite going a perfect 4-for-4 in
a 2-1 win over New Hampshire
on Saturday.
"Our special teams should be
plus for us to be playing well, and
right now they're a big negative,
so we've got to get that fixed,"
Berenson said.
Added senior forward Zach
Hyman: "I think we need to start

gettingthe pucks in the net, start
shooting more, start sticking
with our high-percentage
plays. I think you'll see a big
improvement this weekend."
Boston University was perfect
on the penalty kill in its 5-3 win
over then-No. 3 Boston College.
But UMass-Lowell's shorthanded
performance has been suspect
at times, allowing opponents to
score with the man advantage
three of 10 times this season.
While looking to iron out the
bulky wrinkles on the special
teams units, even-strength
play hasn't been perfect either.
In the 5-1 drubbing that
Michigan suffered against New
Hampshire, it struggled to
consistently enter the offensive
zone with ease.
Puck possession has been
largely emphasized in practice
this week.

"We're focusing on
eliminating our blue-line
turnovers," Hyman said. "That's
been a big focus this week, is just
getting the puck deep and not
turning it over on our blue line
or their blue line."
It's early in the season and
there are few, if any, teams in
the country with no concerns
about their performances. The
Wolverines responded to a
lopsided loss to the Wildcats
with enthusiasm during last
Saturday's narrow victory.
Hoping to ride that small
wave of momentum, Michigan
understands the importance of
winning big games like those
slated for this weekend. A
critical boost in RPI, even this
early in the season, will provide
a firm foundation to build its
case for earning a position in the
NCAA Tournament this spring.

History not on Michigan's side

FOOTBALL
'M' needs season's
best performance

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Editor
Add Vegas to the list of
Michigan doubters.
In a year with far more valleys
than peaks, the Michigan
football team faces its biggest
challenge of the season - a road
game against No. 8 Michigan
State (3-0 Big Ten, 6-1 overall).
Very few, if any, outside of
Michigan's locker room think
the Wolverines can pull off
the biggest upset of Michigan
coach Brady Hoke's four-year
tenure. Many analysts picked
the Wolverines to lose this game
before the season started.
Michigan would need an
outstanding performance from
fifth-year senior quarterback
Devin Gardner, Heisman-like
showings from running backs
sophomore De'Veon Smith and
redshirt junior Justice Hayes
or a 2013-Michigan State-esque
dominance by the defense.
So, to put it mildly, the
Spartans are favorites in this
one. The Wolverines (1-2, 3-4)
opened the week as 15-point
underdogs, and since then,
Vegas' line has moved to 17.
It's the largest spread in the
Spartans' favor in the history of
the rivalry.
"Look, the only people
who really care about that
are gamblers. I don't gamble,"
Hoke said Monday. "That being
said, we've been the underdogs
before, and for us, it's just going
out there and playing football."
And he's right. Michigan has
been an underdog before, but the
team's performances in those
situations doesn't help his cause.
Since Hoke took over in
2011, the Wolverines have been
underdogs 14 times, winning just
three of those games. Of those
14 games, eight of them had
Michigan as more than three-
point underdogs, and the team
came up short all eight times.
The Wolverines' best chance
to change that narrative came

Michigan is a 17-point underdog to Michigan State, the largest spread against the Wolverines in the rivirys history.

By ALEJANDRO ZfNIGA,
Managing Sports Editor
Brady Hoke had to correct
himself during Monday's
press conference ahead of the
Michigan football team's game
against Michigan State.
"This is a great rivalry and a
great rivalry in a lot of ways,"
he said. "Obviously, we have
three great rivalries - two great
rivalries."
Since Notre Dame opted out of
its annual series with them, the
Wolverines have been left with
just two yearly rivalry games.
You can't avoid it now, Michigan
fans: Michigan State is now
undeniably one of the biggest
games of the year.
But the series has been a little
lopsided lately - and not in the
way it has been historically..
The Spartans have won five
of the last six. The Wolverines'
point totals have dropped in
every year since 2004. (The trend
will continue if Michigan scores
fewer than six points Saturday.)
And Michigan State won the
Rose Bowl last season, while
the Wolverines haven't won the
"Grandaddy of Them All" since
Jan. 1,1998.
Michigan is a 17-point under-
dog in Saturday's -game, the
biggest spread against it in the
rivalry's history. If the Wolver-
ines want to snap their Spartan
skid, alot needs to go right.
. "We've been the underdogs
before, and for us, it's just going
out there and playing football
each week," Hoke said. "We've
obviously got to play our best
football Saturday."
This isn't the same Michigan,
State squad that manhandled
Michigan last year, holding
it to minus-48 yards rushing.
The Spartans have looked
vulnerable defensively, allowing
an average of 29 points against

last year when they were five- two coming in the last three
point underdogs on the road matchups. But three of the
against Iowa. But they lost, 24-21, four times when the Spartans
and their fight against the spread were favored, the Wolverines

Another opportunity arose last The lone victory came in 2005

In this rivalry, Michigan has where Michigan was the
been the underdog just four underdog for the first time ever
times in the last 17 years, with against the Wildcats. Hoke

has never beaten Notre Dame,
Michigan State or Ohio State
on the road. And after laying an
egg in South Bend earlier this
season, Hoke has yet another
chance to fix that trend.
"Who wouldn't want to play
a game like this?" Hoke said.
"Who wouldn't want to get
ready to prepare to go play your
best football? ... It's a daggone
important game because it's a
great rivalry game."
This is just the fifth time since
1997 that the Wolverines are
more than 14-point underdogs.
The previous times came in 2008
againstPennState,and2008,2010
and 2013 against the Buckeyes.
Michigan's closest opportunity
for the upset was last year against
then-No. 3 Ohio State.
It's clear that neither history
nor Vegas are on the Wolverines'
side, so all that's left is to just
play the game and see. There's a
first time for everything.

Power S opponents.
But the Wolverines haven't
exactly been an offensive
juggernaut. The unit has reached
the end zone just three times
in five games against Power 5
opposition.
A single touchdown was
enough in an 18-13 victory
Oct. 11 against Penn State. The
Michigan defense shut down the
Nittany Lions in the second half,
and senior Matt Wile kicked the
Wolverines to a win under the Big
House lights.
But the Wolverines might not
be able to rely on such a strong
defensive performance Saturday.
Unlike in previous years, the
Spartansboastplentyofoffensive
weapons. There's quarterback
Connor Cook, whom Hoke called
"one of the better quarterbacks in
this league," and there's receiver
Tony Lippett, whom Hoke said
"has played like the best receiver
in this conference."
"We are playing the defending
Big Ten champs, who deserve
that and have played very good
football during the year on both
sides of the ball," Hoke added.
The Spartans remain
undefeated in the Big Ten an*
have a legitimate chance to claim
back-to-back conference titles
for the first time since 1965-
66. Meanwhile, the Wolverines
haven't finished atop the league
since sharing the honor with
Iowa in 2004.
"It's not about us ruining their
season; it's about us," said fifth-
year senior quarterback Devin
Gardner on Monday.
But if Michigan were to
ruin Michigan State's season,
it would require an inspired
performance by the offense
coupled with another strong
game from the defense.
Otherwise, the Wolverines'
second-biggest rival could
dominate Michigan once again.

Dueling columns: The Daily vs. The State News*

Ifeel bad for my past State
News colleagues. The yearly
rivalry columns used to be
harder to write I'm sure.
But we don't live in that world
anymore. Writing this is as easy
as grabbing
a maize and
blue shirt off
the clearance
rack at
Walmart.
The
dominance
that MSU
has exerted GEOFF
in my time PRESTON
on campus
over the little
sister down the road is almost
hard to watch. And I always
thought it was the Wolverines
who were supposed to feel sorry
for us Spartans.
We're here for you, Ann Arbor.
Seriously, we're here for you.
The phrase "Not our real rival"
Is thrown around with an ease
among Wolverines, an ease that
reflects the delusional nature
that those people live with every
day. Ohio State is going to beat
you too, I know, but we're not our
rival? Come on.
But hey, I'm not here to fight,
Let's entertain your notion of this
not really being much a rivalry,
MSU has won five of the past
six years in football and beat
U-M for the Big Ten title in
basketball. Outside of sports, our
parties are louder, our women
are prettier and The State News
actually gets nominated for
national awards and not just
regional ones.
You know, come to think of it,
"not our rival" might be the most
inarticulate rubbish to spew from
the arrogant, entitled country-
club Michigan fan's mouth since
the 1999 Rose Bowl.

So what does the poor
Michigan fan do? Well, if you
work at The Michigan Daily,
you'll probably resort back to
attacking the quality of our
student publications, because
there's really no ammunition left.
But we can look at that too, and
this'll be fun for the Michigan
fan because we know you guys
love to talk about the past.
The State News has won
14 Pacemaker awards for the
print publication, the highest
prize in college journalism. The
Michigan Daily has not. Not even
close.
The Michigan fan will
probably talk about their winning
streak against The State News
in the two-hand shove football
game we hold once a uear. When
we take that from you, the way
that MSU has taken everything
from U-M in this rivalry, you will
literally have nothing left,
MSU will win on Saturday,
Period. To pile anything else
on your pathetic, kale-eating,
Prius-driving town would be like
putting a kid in a football game
when he had a concussion.
Oh, still too soon?
You can call us "little brother"
all you want, but after The State
News beats the Michigan Daily
this weekend, I suspect you'll
have run out of things to say.
And that dueling column next
year? It'll be even easier for the
guy who comes after me.

more than them to tell you:
If they didn't go to Michigan

The Michigan Daily.
I won't pretend the
Michigan football team will
win on Saturday. It's a team
with an offense that can't stay
on the field and a defense that
can't record turnovers. I won't
try to stick up for a coach and
athletic director who risked a
player's safety by putting him
back out with a concussion.
But I do know that the
school without a journalism
program kicked your ass in the
very subject within the last
year alone.
And after we beat you in
football on Friday, for the 10th 9

the newsroom and continue to
do our job better than you.
Just as we always have. And
that's not up for debate.
