The 
University 
of 

Michigan’s chapter of Biden for 
President hosted Sen. Bernie 
Sanders, I-Vt., in Ann Arbor’s 
Kerrytown Monday afternoon. 
More than 75 people attended 
the rally in person, while more 
than 500 supporters logged on 
to the virtual livestream. 

Sanders started the event by 

emphasizing the importance of 
continuing to make progress in 
a thoughtful, informed way. 

“We can keep our country 

moving forward if we do so in 
a way that is disciplined, not 
dangerous, that is responsible, 
not reckless,” Sanders said. 
“And we (need to) listen to 
science.”

U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, 

D-Mich., spoke to supporters 
about her excitement for the 
election. 

“(It’s 
a) 
really 
exciting, 

important day for me,” Dingell 
said. “We are four weeks out 
from 
the 
most 
important 

election of my lifetime. I’ve 
been talking to Bernie about 

things we care about … we 
both know how important 
the young people are in this 
election.”

Sanders appealed to young 

people, saying they are leading 
activists in many social justice 
issues.

“This is a generation that 

is leading the fight against 
systemic racism and police 
brutality,” Sanders said. “It 
is a generation that is leading 
the fight against xenophobia, 
a generation that is leading 
the fight against sexism. A 
generation that is leading the 

fight against religious bigotry, 
a generation that is leading 
the 
fight 
against 
never-

ending wars and a bloated 
military budget. And this is a 
generation, unlike the current 
president of the United States, 
that knows that climate change 
is real.”

Sanders said despite young 

peoples’ achievements, they 
have 
one 
“major 
political 

shortcoming:” 
low 
voter 

turnout. 

The Michigan Daily sat down 

with University of Michigan 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 
to 

discuss the University’s COVID-
19 response, increasing testing 
availability at UHS, why the 
University sought an injunction 
against GEO, the role of policing 
on campus, the Faculty Senate 
vote 
of 
no 
confidence 
and 

whether he’s still friends with 
Jim Harbaugh. 

This interview has been edited 

and condensed for clarity. 

Mark Schlissel: Obviously, 

(the election is) getting closer 
and closer. We’ve been working 
for years now trying to drive 
voter 
registration 
at 
the 

University, particularly among 
students, (and we’re) doing 
many things trying to make it 
easier. The county clerk and 
the Secretary of State here in 
Michigan 
have 
collaborated 

on letting us set up (a satellite 
office) in the art museum, a 
very convenient site where 
students can actually go vote 
today if they want to, there’s 
early voting in the state of 

Michigan, they can register, or 
they can drop off their absentee 
ballots in person, removing any 
anxiety that somehow the post 
office will slow them down or 
lose them … You know I think 
everybody on campus who’s 
eligible to vote should vote. And 
that’s what we can do to make a 
difference.

The Michigan Daily: So, 

first 
on 
COVID-19. 
There 

have been mixed responses 
to the University’s protocols 
and resources for addressing 
the COVID-19 pandemic on 
campus. Students, parents and 
faculty have voiced concerns 
about 
quarantine 
housing, 

outbreaks on campus and a lack 
of testing to name a few. How 
do you think the University has 
handled the first few weeks 
of school, and do you think 
the reopening plan has been 
successful so far?

MS: I think COVID-19 is 

the 
biggest 
challenge 
that 

we face as a community, at 
least in this generation, and 
certainly in my career. There is 
a lot of uncertainty, so we make 
our best plans based on our 
knowledge and our judgments 
and our values. And then we 
modify them as we learn more 
and as the situation changes. 

One 
of 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan’s 
metrics 
for 

reevaluating campus operations 
amid the COVID-19 pandemic 
has been triggered, University 

President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

confirmed coming two days after 
the guidelines were published 
online. 

Schlissel 
acknowledged 
the 

trigger in a Friday email to 
faculty members concerned about 
the spread of the virus in the 
surrounding community.

“Yes, the metrics were triggered, 

and as per the new policy, our 
public health and medical advisors 
are discussing, based on the 
details of the cases and overall 
context, which next steps are most 
appropriate,” Schlissel wrote in the 
email obtained by The Michigan 
Daily. “As we stated, there are 
many options for interventions 
that must be tailored to the exact 

circumstances. (sic) involved.”

On the University’s Campus 

Blueprint website, the criteria 
include 
Washtenaw 
County 

seeing more than 70 new cases per 
million, sustained test positivity 
rates of 10% or 3 consecutive days 
of a more than 10% case increase.

ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

Though 
the 
University 

of 
Michigan 
provides 

free 
COVID-19 
testing 
to 

symptomatic students, some 
asymptomatic 
students 
are 

opting 
to 
get 
tested 
off-

campus. 

Engineering senior Maya 

Getachew 
was 
tested 
at 

University 
Health 
Service 

as well as an outside urgent 
care center. Getachew said 
the UHS process was faster, 
but the restrictions on who is 
eligible for testing frustrated 
her.

“I kind of had to lie on my 

form to get an appointment,” 
Getachew said. “But once I 
actually went in for the test, 
really fast, I was in and out of 
the building within like five 
minutes. With urgent care, 
there was a little bit of a wait, 
but it was pretty much the 
same thing, once I got the test 
I was out in like 30 seconds.”

Getachew said she got her 

results back from UHS in less 
than 24 hours, while it took 
the urgent care about three 
days.

The University is currently 

testing 
all 
symptomatic 

students 
through 
UHS. 

Students with symptoms can 
fill out an online survey to see 
if they qualify for testing, and 
a UHS employee is supposed 
to 
call 
and 
schedule 
an 

appointment usually on the 
same day. Other local testing 
sites are run through the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Health 

Department, and vary from 
local urgent cares to pop-up 
testing locations across town.

Andie Ransom, who co-leads 

COVID response at UHS, told 
The Michigan Daily that the 
University’s testing capacity 
has 
significantly 
increased 

from the beginning of the year. 
According to Ransom, the 
requirements have changed so 
that any student who has been 
exposed to the virus can get a 
test at UHS. 

“When COVID first started, 

we were very limited in what 
we could do,” Ransom said. 
“And so this new expanded 
testing feels really good for 
us because we want to do 
what’s right for the student. 
And 
(being 
exposed 
is) 

worrisome. We want to make 
sure that these students are 
getting the testing that they 
want.”

People face restrictions with accessing 
testing at University Health Services


Content warning: This piece 

describes depictions of drugging, 
sexual 
assault 
and 
sexual 

harassment.

An anonymous plaintiff Jane 

Doe filed a civil lawsuit against 
the Psi Upsilon fraternity at the 
University of Michigan, claiming 
she was drugged and raped by a 
member of the fraternity while 
attending a party at the fraternity 
house in August 2019.

The 
fraternity 
member 

allegedly coerced Doe to an 
upstairs room in the Psi Upsilon 
house, according to the lawsuit, 
which was filed Monday in the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Circuit 

Court. The fraternity member, 
who was a senior at the time of 
the alleged assault and has since 
graduated, reportedly closed the 
door and told Doe she could not 
leave when she asked to do so. 

The fraternity member then 

gave Doe a cup of water that 
tasted strange, according to the 
complaint. The lawsuit alleges 
that Doe became “completely 
helpless,” 
after 
which 
the 

fraternity member raped her.

According 
to 
the 
lawsuit, 

Doe, who was underage as an 
18-year-old freshman at the time 
of the assault, was given alcohol 
by members of the fraternity. 
The lawsuit says members of 
Psi Upsilon did not ask Doe 
for identification even though 
male guests were asked to show 
identification.

The complaint says that Doe 

was “so visibly intoxicated there 
was no way she could have given 
consent for sexual intercourse.” 

Doe is being represented by 

Vernon Johnson, the namesake 
of Ven Johnson Law, a personal 
injury law firm based out of 
Detroit. The lawsuit names the 
fraternity member as well as 
both the University chapter and 
international headquarters of Psi 
Upsilon.

In a press release from the law 

firm, Johnson said, “this is a cut 
and dry case of assault, battery 
and rape.”

“(The 
fraternity 
member) 

knowingly coerced my client to 
a private room, where he had a 
spiked drink waiting for her and 
then attacked her,” Johnson said. 
“Intentionally taking advantage 
of and raping women who are so 
intoxicated they are incapable 
of giving consent is a disgusting 

and 
reprehensible 
practice. 

These defendants must be held 
accountable for their despicable 
behavior.”

The alleged assault took place 

“during what is referred to 
within the fraternity community 
as 
‘Freshman 
F--k 
Week,’” 

according to the law firm’s press 
release. The lawsuit alleges that 
Psi Upsilon Nationals and the 
University’s Psi Upsilon chapter 
“knew or suspected” that the 
first week of the fall semester 
is known by this nickname and 
thus “encouraged, endorsed and 
provided the opportunity” for 
the fraternity member to rape 
Doe.

Fraternity 
members 
in 

the 
University’s 
chapter 
of 

Psi 
Upsilon 
allegedly 
kept 

a “scorecard” of how many 
women the fraternity brothers 
had sexual intercourse with or 
engaged in sexual petting with 
during “Freshman F--k Week,” 
the lawsuit says. 

In an interview, Johnson said 

under Michigan’s social host 
liability laws, the fraternity was 
also responsible for enabling 
the assault by serving underage 
students alcohol. 

“So here, as it pertains to 

someone who’s going to want 

to say ‘yeah, Johnson, but your 
client was drunk” (…) The fact 
that she got drunk and passed out 
and otherwise was so inebriated 
that she was incapable of giving 
consent, that in essence is what 
they created by giving her the 
alcohol,” Johnson said. 

In a statement to The Daily 

from Thomas Fox, executive 
director of Psi Upsilon Nationals, 
wrote that the organization was 
unaware of the allegations before 
the lawsuit was filed Monday.

“Psi Upsilon Fraternity takes 

all reports of risk management 
violations, 
especially 
those 

with regard to sexual assault, 
very seriously,” Fox wrote. “We 
are currently investigating the 
incident and gathering further 
information as we received no 
notice of allegations prior to 
this complaint being filed. The 
undergraduate chapter is being 
cooperative in this matter.”

When asked for comment, 

the University’s chapter of Psi 
Upsilon directed The Daily to 
Fox’s statement.

The lawsuit was first reported 

Thursday by The Detroit News.

Beginning October 12, U-M will allow all undergraduate students to return to in-person research.

ADVERTISING

WMG-contact@umich.edu 

Starting 
Oct. 
12, 
the 

University of Michigan will 
allow all undergraduate students 
to return to in-person research 
and scholarship, according to an 
email update sent to the research 
community 
from 
Rebecca 

Cunningham, vice president of 
research at the University. 

Previously, 
the 
policy 
on 

undergraduate 
research 
only 

granted 
seniors 
with 
prior 

research experience to return 
to an in-person lab setting. 
This new policy, however, will 
expand the previous guidelines 
to allow all undergraduates — 
including those with no research 
experience — to engage in 
in-person research.

“Recognizing 
that 
our 

research productivity is not yet 
back to 100 percent, this next 
phase will allow for increased 
laboratory density, an expansion 
of human research participants 
and 
increased 
access 
for 

undergraduate 
researchers, 

who play a critical role in our 
research mission,” Cunningham 
wrote. 

This new policy will also allow 

labs to increase the capacity from 
45 to 60 percent as long as social 
distancing and face covering 
guidelines are maintained on 

any given shift. Cunningham 
underscored the importance of 
continual monitoring of virus 
transmission as this new policy 
is put in place.

“Research 
leadership 
will 

continuously 
monitor 
virus 

transmission rates over the next 
4-6 weeks to ensure our research 
community can safely maintain 
this expansion,” Cunningham 
wrote. “The health and safety 
of our research community will 
remain our top priority.” 

As of Sept. 29, nine total 

researchers have tested positive 
for COVID-19 since May 21, 
according to the email update. 
Based on contact tracing of 
asymptomatic 
individuals 

where a fellow lab member has 
tested positive, no sign of virus 
transmission has taken place in 
research settings.

LSA sophomore Kylie Schache 

conducts research in two labs 
— a microbiology lab and an 
Alzheimer’s lab. She said though 
this 
policy 
will 
technically 

allow her to return to in-person 
research, the capacity limits 
will still prioritize the graduate 
students 
and 
post-doctoral 

fellows in her lab. 

“If the option were open for 

me to work in person, I would 
certainly 
take 
it,” 
Schache 

said. “Right now, the issue is 
letting undergraduates return 

to research labs would take 
time slots away from graduate 
students or postdoc researchers 
because of the capacity limits. 
And so, I understand they have 
seniority, since it’s their full-
time job to do research.”

Schache noted that even if 

she were to return, she would 
not have concerns with safety 
or spreading COVID-19, given 
that many of the procedures 
within research settings already 
account 
for 
cleanliness 
and 

sanitation. 

“If there was a way that I 

could return to in-person work, 
I wouldn’t have any concerns 
in terms of safety regarding the 
virus just because labs are under 
so 
many 
safety 
restrictions 

normally, since we work with 
dangerous chemicals and what 
not,” Schache said. “The safety 
regulations in place right now 
especially — I mean they’re 
maintaining 
distance 
very 

strictly, they’re keeping limits 
on how many people can be in 
the same space, PPE (personal 
protective equipment) guidelines 
are followed very closely, so 
I won’t be concerned about 
returning from that standpoint.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Nicholas 

Cemalovic 
shared 
similar 

sentiments in that graduate 
students are often prioritized 
when assigning shifts, since 

they depend on the research 
setting 
for 
their 
degrees. 

Cemalovic said he is involved in 
an environmental toxicology lab 
with the School of Public Health. 

“I also understand that every 

year, there are new grad students 
rotating and there’s graduate 
students who need to get their 
degrees by being in there, so I 
understand the hierarchy, but I 
think introducing undergrads 
slowly 
would 
be 
great,” 

Cemalovic said.

Back 
in 
March, 
when 

Cemalovic had to transition 
into a remote research setting, 
he said he found other ways to 
stay engaged with the research 
community, despite not being 
able to return to in-person 
work.

“I found a way to transition 

into research in a different 
way,” Cemalovic said. “I found 
a lot of different methods that I 
could still be active. So, during 
that first bit of quarantine, 
I was still going to talks and 
lectures, I was doing a little bit 
of literature review. A good thing 
about a lot of wet lab biomedical 
research is that there’s always 
data being produced, so there’s 
always data to be analyzed.”

When 
bringing 
their 

concerns 
to 
Schlissel, 
the 

faculty members noted the 
metric regarding more than 70 
new cases per million in the 
county had been met. 

According to data published 

on MI Safe Start Map, daily 
new cases per million were 
above 70 in Washtenaw County 
around a dozen times during 
the last weeks of September. 
After that point, the daily new 
cases per million fell below the 
threshold. 

The University posted the 

metrics 
online 
Wednesday. 

Schlissel 
had 
previously 

declined to name a specific 
threshold such as a certain 
number of cases that would 
require the campus to close 
again.

Information 
Professor 

Kentaro 
Toyama, 
who 
has 

been vocal in his criticism of 
Schlissel, wrote in his email to 
the president that the metrics 
were not stringent enough.

“Many 
of 
us 
believe, 

incidentally, 
that 
these 

response metrics are lenient 
-- they are weaker than the 
standards at other universities,” 
Toyama wrote. “The language 
on the website calls these 
‘situations that might provoke 
changes in our campus plans,’ 
which unfortunately commits 
to no action, and is logically 
equivalent to this summer’s 
propaganda.”

When 
a 
threshold 
is 

breached, the University begins 
a review of campus operations 
to consider what response is 
needed.

In an email to The Daily 

Friday 
night, 
University 

spokesperson Rick Fitzgerald 
said Schlissel was in discussions 
with public health experts and 
advisers about the next steps.

“He was confirming what 

had been noted in the email, 
that in Washtenaw County 
there are more than 70 new 
cases per million,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “As he indicated, the 
Campus 
Health 
Response 

Committee 
is 
carefully 

considering the situation. It is 
important to note that, as the 
president said, ‘there are many 
options for interventions that 
must be tailored to the exact 
circumstances.’”

Other triggers include an 

inability to conduct prompt 
case investigation and contact 
tracing or limited bed capacity 
or 
personal 
protective 

equipment 
at 
Michigan 

Medicine. Additional metrics 
are five days of test positivity 
rates above 20% from on and 
off-campus 
testing 
or 
five 

days of sustained increases 
in infections among students, 
staff or faculty, which would 
be determined in coordination 
with the Washtenaw County 
Health Department.

Possible mitigation strategies 

range from restricting travel 
on-campus students to pausing 
in-person classes for two weeks 
or even pivoting to fully online 
classes for the remainder of 
the semester. More extreme 
options could include a shelter-
in-place 
order 
issued 
in 

coordination with local public 
health 
officials 
or 
closing 

residence halls. However, the 
guidelines note that the latter 
measure “must be evaluated 
and undertaken with care due 
to the risk of seeding infections 
from the student population 
into other communities.” 

Public health experts have 

also noted the potential danger 

of sending students back home 
from a campus that has become 
a COVID-19 hotspot.

On 
Tuesday, 
University 

Housing identified clusters of 
COVID-19 cases at Mosher-
Jordan Residence Hall and 
Alice Lloyd Residence Hall. 
Earlier in September, a cluster 
was reported at South Quad 
Residence Hall.

At the start of the pandemic 

last spring, students in dorms 
faced 
uncertainty 
about 

whether or not they would be 
forced to return home or if 
they could stay on campus. The 
University eventually offered a 
$1,200 refund to students who 
left the residence halls. 

In an interview with The 

Daily Thursday, Schlissel said 
he does not anticipate needing 
to send students home in the 
near future. 

“I very much doubt that the 

pandemic will get bad enough 
that we literally have to send 
everybody 
home,” 
Schlissel 

said. “I think there’s a long way 
between 
sending 
everybody 

home and where we are now 
where 
we 
can 
scale 
back 

prudently, and really truly limit 
things to things that can only 
happen face-to-face.”

In a video posted with the 

criteria on Wednesday, Preeti 
Malani, chief health officer at 
the University, said the metrics 
were based on those currently 
in use at the state and local level, 
as well as national guidelines.

“There is no one single 

number 
or 
single 
piece 
of 

information that will prompt 
an immediate change,” Malani 
said. “... These response metrics 
are meant to prompt a broader 
review by public health and 
medical experts.”

According to the University’s 

COVID-19 
dashboard, 
there 

have been 555 cases on campus 
since Aug. 30, the day before 
fall classes started. As of Friday 
night, 2,571 tests have been 
conducted this week, with a 
1.5% positivity rate.

In a press release Friday, 

Jimena Loveluck, health officer 
for Washtenaw County, noted 
that young people accounted for 
the majority of cases.

“We are currently seeing a 

sharp increase in cases among 
local, college-age individuals,” 
Loveluck said in a statement. 
“We know social gatherings 
without 
precautions 
are 
a 

primary source of exposure. We 
can prevent additional spread 

by 
keeping 
all 
gatherings 

small, using face coverings and 
distance, and fully cooperating 
with case investigators and 
contact tracers.”

County 
data 
showed 
a 

“significant increase” in the 
proportion 
of 
cases 
among 

people between 18 and 22 
years old, who made up 78% of 
reported cases from Sept. 17 to 
Sept. 30.

Aspects of the University’s 

reopening plan have been met 
with pushback from public 
health 
professionals. 
Julia 

Marcus, an infectious disease 
epidemiologist and professor at 
Harvard Medical School, called 
Schlissel’s 
approach 
one 
of 

“false reassurance,” referencing 
the lack of widespread testing.

Schlissel also acknowledged 

the increases in cases over 
recent weeks on Thursday.

“I 
am 
very 
concerned,” 

Schlissel said. “I think we’re 
holding our own, but things 
are not heading in the right 
direction now.”

METRIC
From Page 1

In an interview with the 

Daily, University of Michigan 
President Mark Schlissel said 
that he had instructed UHS 
to ease up restrictions on who 
could receive a test, in order 
to encourage students to get 
tested.

“We’re telling (UHS) to ease 

up because we want students to 
use UHS,” Schlissel said. “It’s 
free, it’s convenient, there’s a 
one-day turnaround time, and 
we can work with students 
immediately when they get a 
positive result to help assure 
their health and to make sure 
it doesn’t spread to others, so 
we’re going to have the UHS 
folks be a little more relaxed … 
You know, we want to test you.”

The 
University 
has 
said 

it would test approximately 
3,000 asymptomatic students 
a week through a voluntary 
surveillance testing program, 
with 
plans 
to 
ramp 
up 

capacity to 6,000 tests per 
week beginning in October. 
According to the University’s 
COVID-19 
website, 
more 

than 3,100 students combined 
have been tested through the 
surveillance program in the 
last four weeks. 

After 
concerns 
regarding 

the accuracy of the school’s 

COVID-19 
dashboard, 
the 

University incorporated off-
campus positive results, more 
than doubling the cumulative 
case count since the start of the 
school year. 

Susan 
Ringler-Cerniglia, 

Washtenaw 
County 
health 

department 
communications 

administrator, said the county 
only receives the number of 
positive results, leaving the 
total number of off-campus 
tests conducted unknown.

The 
county’s 
health 

department 
has 
a 
legal 

agreement with the University 
to alert the school of all 
University-related cases. To 
check if a positive case is tied 
to the University, Ringler-
Cerniglia 
said 
the 
health 

department looks to see if 
the case is connected to an 
on-campus address or an out-
of-state address. Both of these 
are usually good indicators 
that the person who tested 
positive was a student.

“Is it absolutely, 100 percent 

foolproof? 
No,” 
Ringler-

Cerniglia 
said. 
“But 
our 

experiences over the years, it 
works pretty well at figuring 
out when those positive test 
results come up.”

Students who get tested off-

campus are supposed to report 
both their positive or negative 
results to the University on the 
UHS website. But LSA junior 

Sophie Gibson, who got tested 
at Eastern Michigan University, 
said she was unaware she had 
to share her result. 

“I was told there was a rapid 

test for free at EMU,” Gibson 
said. “I did not report my 
results. I don’t really know how 
to do that.”

Ringler-Cerniglia said the 

health department has seen 
an influx of rapid antigen 
tests recently. She expressed 
concern about this trend, as 
rapid tests have high rates of 
false negatives.

Urgent care centers and 

other 
off-campus 
testing 

centers are not required to 
report their case counts or 
any other information to the 
University. 
Representatives 

from 
urgent 
care 
centers 

Michigan Urgent Care and 
Prognify told The Daily they 
do not track whether patients 
are students, meaning they 
cannot provide the University 
with information about the 
student test results. Instead, 
local urgent cares are required 
to report positive cases to the 
Washtenaw 
County 
Health 

Department, which according 
to Schlissel, works “hand in 
glove” with the University.

“So they send us those 

results, we collaborate, and 
then we do the investigation, 
case 
tracking, 
we 
provide 

quarantine,” Schlissel said. “So 

all that it does when you get a 
positive test off campus, is it 
slows down by at least a day, 
how quickly we can intervene 
to try to keep a positive case 
from 
spreading 
amongst 

friends or contacts so it’s not a 
great strategy.”

A representative from Ann 

Arbor Urgent Care told The 
Daily they charge $150 for 
a COVID-19 test to students 
without 
health 
insurance. 

The cost can pose a barrier to 
students who do not qualify for 
UHS testing.

In 
a 
Sept. 
25 
email, 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
said 
he 
wanted 

to 
“emphasize 
again 
the 

importance of students being 
tested at UHS, especially in 
light of the numbers of positive 
cases 
that 
we 
are 
seeing 

identified 
by 
off-campus 

testing.”

As of Sunday night, the 

Maize and Blueprint COVID-19 
dashboard showed more than 
600 cases since the week of 
Aug. 30. The University has also 
confirmed COVID-19 clusters 
in South Quad, Mosher-Jordan 
and Alice Lloyd Residences 
Halls. Additionally, on Friday 
Washtenaw County exceeded 
the number of cases needed for 
administrators to reevaluate 
on-campus operations.

After coming in contact 

with a friend whose roommate 

had 
tested 
positive, 
LSA 

junior Jordan Wank wanted 
to get tested for COVID-19 
immediately. He said he opted 
for UHS because he thought 
the result would come back 
faster. 

“(It was) very easy,” Wank 

said. “I was handed a sticker 
and then I gave it to a doctor 
and they tested me and then I 
left. It was 36 hours from the 
time I contacted them to when 
I received my results.”

Getachew 
said 
she 
was 

pleasantly surprised by the 
quick 
turnaround 
of 
UHS 

testing, but still has complaints 
about the University’s overall 
testing situation. 

“I do still believe that the 

school is doing a lot of under-
testing, and I don’t believe I 
should lie if I’ve been exposed 
to someone in order to get a 
test,” Getachew said. “So I 
think my frustration is still 
very real with the fact that it’s 
not as easy to get a test from 
the school, and my first option 
was to go to urgent care.”

Some public health experts 

have 
been 
critical 
of 
the 

University’s plans for testing, 
saying it is not expansive 
enough to keep the virus in 
check.

Ransom 
said 
she 

understands that off-campus 
tests 
may 
seem 
appealing 

because students can just walk 

in. However, Ransom said it 
is either less reliable or takes 
longer than in-house tests at 
UHS.

“Outside testing facilities 

are either using an unreliable 
rapid test that then has to have 
a confirmatory PCR (nasal 
swab) test, or they’re using 
PCR tests through the state 
of Michigan, which is three 
to five days until you get your 
result,” Ransom said.

Ransom said because UHS 

uses Michigan Medicine as 
its lab site, most students 
get results in 24 hours. She 
encouraged students to test at 
UHS if they can and stressed 
that a UHS test does not 
require students to quarantine 
on North Campus. 

She added that a negative test 

does not remove the burden of 
quarantining for 14 days.

“Students who have a high-

risk exposure will need to 
quarantine for 14 days, even 
if they have a negative test 
result,” Ransom said. “So the 
test result being negative does 
not free them from quarantine 
early. We want to make sure 
that everyone here on campus 
is safe, and so doing your part to 
kind of minimize risk to other 
students is really important.”

TESTING
From Page 1

The first couple of weeks of 

the semester went spectacularly 
well, the number of cases was 
exceedingly low, the pre-arrival 
screening for people in the 
residence halls (tested) 6000 
people, we were able to identify 
22 positive cases, a very low 
rate but those folks came to 
school later. So the year got off 
to an outstanding start. The last 
couple of weeks have been very 
difficult, and the number of cases 
have grown significantly. I don’t 
know whether it’s confidence, or 
misguided ideas, but more and 
more testing of students is being 
done off campus at local testing 
facilities, perhaps with the idea 
of not wanting the University 
to find out if somebody has the 
virus which, regardless of other 
thoughts is not a very good 
strategy amongst students. But 
things have gotten significantly 
more challenging the last two to 
two and a half weeks, probably 
part of it as things are getting 
colder, a little bit more socializing 
moving indoors. Another part is 
probably people getting tired of 
having to constrain the way they 
want to interact, so we’re sort of 
letting our guard down a little 
bit. 

… Everyone should realize 

that COVID-19 is a reportable 
disease so that means the law 
says that any testing facility has 
to report all positive results to 
the relevant county and state 
health department — it’s the law. 
So what happens when someone 
gets tested off-campus, if they’re 
positive, the result goes to the 

county health department, and 
we work hand in glove with 
the Washtenaw County Health 
Department. 
We 
meet 
with 

them on a daily basis, we’re 
working together trying to deal 
with some outbreaks in town 
amongst Michigan students. So 
they send us those results, we 
collaborate, and then we do the 
investigation, case tracking, we 
provide quarantine. So all that it 
does when you get a positive test 
off campus, is it slows down by at 
least a day, how quickly we can 
intervene to try to keep a positive 
case from spreading amongst 
friends or contacts so it’s not a 
great strategy.

I do understand, though, that 

people have complained to me. 
For example, that one reason 
they’ll get tested off campus is 
the University Health Service 
won’t test them, or they’ll say, 
‘Look, I’ve had a close contact,’ 
and the health service talks to 
them a little, and it really isn’t a 
close contact, it’s a casual contact 
and health service was saying 
‘Look, you know we have to put 
our resources where the to close 
public health contacts are.’ But 
we’re telling (UHS) to ease up 
because we want students to use 
UHS. It’s free, it’s convenient, 
there’s a one-day turnaround 
time, and we can work with 
students immediately when they 
get a positive result to help assure 
their health and to make sure it 
doesn’t spread to others, so we’re 
going to have the UHS folks 
be a little more relaxed … You 
know, we want to test you. We’re 
ramping up our testing capacity, 
this coming week on Monday we 
switched to a saliva test … And 
that’s really in response to the 

community saying, ‘We don’t feel 
safe because we don’t feel there’s 
enough testing.’ Up to now, 
we’ve been using testing to do 
a statistical surveillance of the 
campus so we can act on areas 
where the rates are increasing. 
But I do think it’s important to 
recognize that people’s sense 
of safety and well-being is very 
important, and if we can improve 
that by expanding testing and 
maybe even making it mandatory 
for people in dormitories –– 
we’re discussing that now –– it 
would reassure a lot of people, 
and help us better deal with the 
pandemic collectively.

TMD: So, given the sharp 

uptick in student COVID-19 
cases over the last few weeks, are 
you still more confident than not, 
that students will be responsible 
and that we’ll make it through 
the fall semester in person?

MS: 
You 
know, 
it’s 
an 

extremely 
difficult 
question, 

and I am very concerned. I think 
we’re holding our own, but things 
are not heading in the right 
direction now. It’s not an “all-
or-none” kind of thing. In other 
words, when infections increase, 
the only option isn’t to send 
everybody home. There are lots 
of options short of that … What 
we do when there’s a case, or a 
cluster of cases, is we investigate 
them and we ask whether they’re 
spreading 
throughout 
the 

community, or whether they’re 
limited to a group of students, 
usually people that are socially 
interacting with each other. 
One of the places we’re running 
into trouble in the last couple of 
weeks is in the fraternities and 
sororities in town, both affiliated 
and some of the disaffiliated 

fraternities, where we haven’t 
gotten uniformly the level of 
cooperation 
that’s 
necessary 

to be able to investigate cases 
and try to protect people and 
prevent it from spreading. So 
that’s something we’re working 
very closely with the health 
department on, on literally an 
every single day basis.

TMD: 
The 
Graduate 

Employees’ Organization went 
on strike earlier this month. 
Among GEO’s demands was the 
universal right to work remotely. 
The University has extended 
that right to faculty, but even 
in the final offer made to GEO, 
the University did not offer that 
right to graduate employees. 
In communications to both the 
graduate employees and the 
student body at large, other 
demands have been addressed, 
but there has not been a clear 
explanation of why that right 
cannot be given to graduate 
employees. Why is that?

MS: Faculty do not have a 

universal right to decide whether 
they want to work in person or 
remotely. That may be something 
that you’ve been told, but that’s 
actually not true. The Graduate 
Student Instructors are actually 
treated the same as faculty in this 
regard. We try to accommodate 
every single person’s sense of 
health and safety, preexisting 
or predisposing conditions, etc. 
And at the end, it’s very difficult 
to identify people that are willing 
to say they feel forced to teach 
in person … So as part of the 
resolution of the strike, we came 
up with a mechanism where any 
GSI who feels uncomfortable or 
unsafe in the class and doesn’t 
have their question immediately 

resolved, can step away and 
teach 
remotely 
while 
we 

investigate the situation and try 
to fix the problem … We have no 
interest in being anything other 
than collaborative with our own 
students. 

Now what pushed us to, 

you know, go the route of an 
injunction and try to get some 
help, is I was very concerned that 
the integrity of the Michigan 
undergraduate curriculum was 
being threatened … when classes 
are getting canceled for a couple 
of weeks, and education of other 
people is being interfered with, 
why would someone want to 
come and be an undergraduate 
at the University of Michigan 
if I couldn’t assure that they’d 
actually get to take the classes 
they signed up for? And if it kept 
going on for weeks and weeks, 
what would happen to your 
semester? We would give you 
all incompletes. That’s it, you 
paid for it, but you’re not going 
to get any credit. So we had to 
come up with a way to help the 
GEO feel safe and be safe in the 
classroom and deal with their 
concerns around their academic 
progress as students in order 
to 
keep 
the 
undergraduate 

curriculum going. We had an 
agreement the very first week, 
and the leadership took it back to 
the members and the members 
voted it down. So we were very 
concerned that we weren’t going 
to be able to reach an agreement. 
And all the while, you know, of 
course we were continuing to pay 
our graduate students. We never 
stopped paying them, we never 
stopped covering their tuition, 
we never threatened anyone 
individually. The injunction was 

aimed at the union as opposed 
to individuals. We were going to 
sue the union if they didn’t live 
up to their word to go back to 
work.

TMD: In their demands, 

GEO included disarming DPSS 
and reallocating around 50 
percent of its funding. Why 
did the University not really 
address GEO’s concerns over 
policing in the offers extended 
to them beyond the creation of 
a review commission, and has 
the strike made you reconsider 
policing on campus?

MS: I think what’s made 

us think hard about policing 
on campus is what’s been 
happening in the United States 
and, you know, not just the 
last few months but certainly 
the last few months, but in 
recent 
years, 
the 
greater 

and greater appreciation of 
disproportionate policing. The 
killing by police of unarmed 
people and very prominently 
Black people in recent months. 
The fear and anxiety that many 
people have simply seeing a 
police officer, all those things, 
lead us to the conclusion that, 
not only do we have to look 
at policing more broadly in 
society, but we have to make 
sure that we’re doing it right 
here at the University. So, 
I have nothing but respect 
and gratitude to the GEOs 
for bringing this up, but it’s 
not just a GEO issue. It’s an 
undergraduate student issue, 
it’s a schools and colleges issue, 
it’s a city of Ann Arbor issue.

Cities and local leaders 

across the country have faced 
economic and social turmoil 
throughout 
the 
COVID-19 

pandemic.

On Wednesday morning, 

the 
Taubman 
College 
of 

Architecture 
and 
Urban 

Planning welcomed mayors 
Jacob Frey of Minneapolis, 
Lori Lightfoot of Chicago, 
Libby 
Schaaf 
of 
Oakland, 

Calif. and Michael Tubbs of 
Stockton, Calif., to a panel 
titled “America’s Mayors on 
Crisis and Change.”

University 
President 

Mark Schlissel opened the 
event by describing cities as 
“laboratories for democracy.” 
He 
thanked 
the 
Poverty 

Solutions 
Initiative 
and 

Taubman for collaborating on 
hosting the event.

Taubman Dean Jonathan 

Massey 
introduced 
the 

panel’s members. He noted 
that Lightfoot is the first 
Black woman and first openly 
gay mayor of Chicago, while 
Tubbs 
is 
Stockton’s 
first 

Black mayor and the youngest 
mayor of any city with more 
than 100,000 residents.

Massey asked Tubbs and 

Schaaf about their Universal 
Basic 
Income 
initiatives, 

which 
would 
provide 
an 

“unconditional 
periodic 

payment” 
to 
their 
cities’ 

poorest residents. Tubbs said 
the pandemic reaffirmed his 
plans to provide a UBI, adding 
that poverty is the result of 
policymakers’ decisions.

According 
to 
Schaaf 

a 
UBI 
would 
encourage 

socioeconomic mobility.

“People 
spend 
this 

unconditional cash on basic 
needs,” Schaaf said. “In fact, 
sometimes people take this 
little extra pillow so that they 

can quit their third job and 
look to upgrade their skills.”

Massey’s 
next 
question 

focused on how mayors can 
simultaneously 
appease 

constituents protesting police 
brutality while maintaining a 
good relationship with their 
police forces. Frey, whose 
city was at the center of this 
issue this summer after police 
officers killed George Floyd 
in Minneapolis, said mayors 
have to uphold freedom of 
speech.

“It is incumbent on mayors 

to be ardent defenders of our 
First Amendment,” Frey said. 

Frey 
then 
denounced 

property 
destruction 
and 

looting that took place in 
the wake of Floyd’s murder. 
He was met with pushback 
in 
the 
comments 
section, 

where some people demanded 
he acknowledge that most 
protests were peaceful. 

One of the people tied to the 

looting was later connected 
to a white supremacist group 
and “specifically sought to 
inflame 
racial 
tensions,” 

according to police.

Massey 
asked 
about 

strategies to dismantle white 
supremacy. Frey pointed to 
redlining in Minneapolis.

“We literally have maps 

at city hall dating back 80 to 
a hundred years that define 
North Minneapolis as a slum 
for Blacks and Jews,” Frey 
said. 

Frey continued, advocating 

for 
homeownership 
as 

a 
method 
to 
generate 

intergenerational wealth. 

Other cities have pursued 

different avenues of economic 
revitalization.

In East Oakland, Calif., 

Schaaf 
said 
community 

members 
proposed 
the 

creation of an aquaponics 
farm 
in 
an 
abandoned 

greenhouse and a bike-share 
program where bikes could 

serve as art to be decorated. 
Schaaf said she was excited 
the project had recently won 
a 
$28-million 
grant 
from 

the Transformative Climate 
Communities 
program 
to 

move forward. 

Schaaf noted how her city 

implements 
a 
community-

oriented design process for 
some 
of 
its 
construction 

projects.

“This year for the first 

time we’re actually inviting 
communities 
to 
propose 

capital 
improvement 

projects,” Schaaf said. 

The panel took questions 

from 
the 
live 
comments 

section. 
Rackham 
student 

Nana Andoh asked if any of 
the mayors enacted policies 
during the pandemic that they 
hope to keep permanently.

Lightfoot, who started a 

Racial Equity Rapid Response 
Team at the beginning of the 
pandemic, said she hoped 
some of those programs would 
stay. Established in April of 
2020, the team is meant to 
“address the disproportionate 
impact of the coronavirus 
pandemic 
on 
African-

American communities.”

“I don’t want to build 

temporary scaffolding around 
anything,” Lightfoot said.

Public 
Policy 
graduate 

student Kyle Slugg asked how 
the mayors are making sense 
of the current crisis. Tubbs 
said a large part of his job is 
“reckoning with whether the 
status quo is truly untenable.”

Massey closed the panel 

by asking what leadership 
principle each would bring 
if they ran for president of 
the United States, to which 
Lightfoot answered, “never, 
ever, ever.”

As part of her requirements

this year, her clinicals — the

are taking place 
against 
the

COVID-19 

has 
touched 

nearly all facets 
of 
American 

life 
since 
its 

onset in March. 
University 
leadership 

announced a “public-health 
informed” 
hybrid 
fall 

semester, which began at 
the start of the month, with 
nearly 80% of coursework 
delivered remotely.

The Nursing School has, in 

turn, adapted its curriculum 
to 
match 
the 
moment. 

Students reported many of 
their lectures now take place 
online, as do the post-clinical 
reflection meetings that offer 
a chance to reflect on their 
experiences in the field.

However, 
students 
are 

completing 
in-person 

clinicals as they would any 
other semester, but with some 
changes to protocol. Students 
wear masks on their shifts — 
some of which can last up to 
16 hours — and they are not 
required to treat patients 
who have tested positive for 
COVID-19. 

During a clinical, students 

will 
work 
with 
staff 
on 

day-to-day tasks to better 
understand the specific area 
of medicine they study and 
how nurses fit in. Nursing 
students 
have 
multiple 

clinical experiences before 
graduating, with placements 
ranging 
from 
emergency 

rooms 
to 
assisted 
living 

facilities for senior citizens.

Winter semester clinicals 

were 
canceled 
in 
March 

because 
unprecedented 

circumstances 
arose 
that 

were outside the school’s 
control, according to Nursing 
Dean 
Patricia 
Hurn. 
She 

said the school and clinical 
partners now have a better 
understanding 
of 
the 

risks 
associated 
with 
the 

coronavirus, allowing them 
to provide in-person clinicals.

Students in joining the 

front lines are also gaining 
necessary 
clinical 
hours 

to 
become 
state-certified 

nurses. There is no option for 
students to complete clinicals 
virtually, Hurn said, but the 
Nursing School will work 
with students who need to 
step away from any part of 
their studies.

And students are seeing 

what it’s like to be in a 
hospital when the unexpected 
happens, Hurn said.

“It’s one thing as a student 

to think about how difficult 
things could be if there were 
a pandemic, if there were a 
major disaster,” Hurn said. 
“It’s another thing to be 
working in the reality where 
that’s the case.”

But 
there 
is 
still 
risk 

associated 
with 
going 
to 

clinicals, 
McDonald 
said. 

Nurses might interact with 
patients who have gotten 
inaccurate 
COVID-19 

test 
results, 
for 
example. 

McDonald, who worked at 
Michigan Medicine over the 
summer as a patient care 
technician, also said patients 
could test positive after she 
already worked with them 
and she would not know if she 
had been exposed.

Some 
seniors 
work 
in 

departments like emergency 
rooms where they may not 

know if a patient has the virus 
upon first interaction. Other 
Nursing students will also be 
assisting in contact tracing 
efforts this semester.

Nursing students typically 

begin 
clinicals 
during 

their sophomore year. The 
number of hours spent on 
these 
rotations 
largely 

depends on what year they 
are in the program and their 
scheduling. Some seniors in 

the program have tried to 
schedule additional hours 
at the beginning of the 
semester to ensure they 
can still meet graduation 
and 
certification 

requirements if school 
moves online, Nursing 
senior Reagan Cloutier 
said.

“Most of us are going 

to graduate, obviously, 
with this pandemic still 
happening,” 
Cloutier, 

who is also president 
of the Student Nurses 
Association, said. “It’s 
good for us to experience 
what it’s like right now, 
as a student. That way, 
once we get out into the 
real world, we’re going 
to know what to expect 
and how to operate under 
these circumstances.”

Nursing 
students 

have felt a sense of pride 
and usefulness in being 
able to provide medical 
care as the pandemic 

rages 
on. 
McDonald 
said 

she felt helpless in March 
when their rotations were 
canceled, wishing she could 
do something to help. But 
in being back, they are also 
learning a lesson about their 
future profession: nurses have 
to expect the unexpected in 
medicine.

When they began their 

clinicals 
again 
this 
fall, 

students said they felt excited 
to 
receive 
the 
hands-on 

training. 

Regardless of the changes 

brought on by the pandemic, 
students 
say 
much 
of 
it 

feels the same. They still 
get to work with medical 
professionals 
and 
interact 

with patients. Despite the 
risks, these students agree 
that they are where they are 
meant to be.

“It’s inspired me,” Nursing 

junior Maureen Kozlowski 
said. “I look at all this chaos 
that’s going on in the world, 
but I’m still going to provide 
the exact same care for my 
patient because they don’t 
deserve anything less.”

AG office to investigate 
group with ties to Weiser

Unlock Michigan collects petition signatures criminally

Michigan Attorney General 

Dana 
Nessel 
announced 

Monday that her office would 
be opening an investigation 
into Unlock Michigan, a state 
political 
action 
committee 

alleged to have criminally 
collected petition signatures 
to repeal a state law. The 
statute 
in 
question 
is 
a 

1945 Emergency Powers of 
Governor Act being used by 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to 
address the ongoing COVID-
19 pandemic in the state. 

According to a press release 

from Nessel’s office, a number 
of residents complained that 
Unlock 
Michigan 
obtained 

their 
signatures 
illegally, 

telling them that the petition 
was for another cause.

“The 
Attorney 
General’s 

office has received complaints 
from residents who report 
they 
were 
deceived 
by 

petition 
circulators 
who 

were gathering signatures to 
support the efforts of Unlock 
Michigan, which is trying to 
repeal the 1945 Emergency 
Powers of the Governor Act,” 
the release read. “Residents 
said 
they 
were 
told 
the 

petitions were to support 
LGBTQ rights, for medical 
marijuana initiatives or to 
help small businesses, among 
other things.”

Founded in the wake of 

Whitmer’s March 23 “Stay 
Home, 
Stay 
Safe” 
order, 

Unlock Michigan’s goal has 
been to roll back the governor’s 
COVID-19 
quarantine 
and 

social 
distancing 
policies. 

According 
to 
its 
website, 

the 
PAC 
sees 
Whitmer’s 

orders 
as 
unconstitutional 

and damaging to individual 
freedom. 

“Unlock 
Michigan 
is 

a 
coalition 
of 
concerned 

Michiganders who believe that 
Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s 
crushing lockdown of life and 
business 
across 
Michigan 

is a dangerous threat to our 
livelihoods and constitutional 
liberties,” the website reads.

Unlock 
Michigan 

spokesman Fred Wszolek told 
The Daily the investigation 
was politically motivated.

“It’s a partisan political 

farce, which is to be expected 
from this partisan political 
Attorney General,” Wszolek 
said. “This sham investigation 
is 
designed 
to 
deprive 

Michigan citizens of their 
constitutional right to initiate 
legislation, but we’re not going 
to allow that to happen.”

One 
financial 
supporter 

of the PAC is Ronald Weiser, 
the former chairman of the 
Michigan Republican Party 
and current member of the 
University of Michigan’s Board 
of Regents, who gave a direct 
contribution of $100,000 to 
the organization on July 27, 
according to documents filed 
with the Secretary of State.

In a message sent to The 

Michigan Daily, Weiser said 
that he was not familiar 
with Unlock Michigan or its 
activities at the time of his 
donation.

“I 
know 
nothing 
about 

the investigation. I (know) 
nothing 
about 
Unlock 

Michigan,” Weiser wrote. “I 
made the contribution because 
of who asked me.”

He declined to name the 

person who asked him to make 
the contribution.

Weiser was elected to the 

board, which serves as the 
University’s governing body, 
in 2016. He is currently the 
only Republican regent; two 
of the Democratic incumbents 
— Mark Bernstein and Shauna 
Ryder Diggs — are up for 
reelection 
in 
November. 

They will face Republican 
challengers Sarah Hubbard 
and Carl Meyers.

According to a Sept. 22 

report from the Detroit Free 
Press, a secretly recorded 
video of an Unlock Michigan 
training session for signature 
collectors on Sept. 4 showed 
that a trainer for the group 
“coached 
paid 
petition 

circulators on giving voters 
false 
information, 
illegally 

collecting signatures without 
witnessing them, trespassing 
on private property, and even 
lying under oath.”

In a statement, Nessel said 

the group’s alleged practices 
represent a clear violation of 
the law, and as such fall under 
the purview of her office.

“Our democracy is firmly 

rooted in the principles of an 
informed 
electorate 
which 

makes decisions at the polls 
based on reason and beliefs 
over 
lies 
and 
deception,” 

Nessel said in the press release. 
“Our ballot initiative process 
allows efforts with strong 
public support to be presented 
to the Legislature. But that 
process 
becomes 
tainted 

when 
petition 
circulators 

manipulate and cheat to serve 
their own agendas.”

STEM students face overtime lectures, extra work

With 
the 
majority 
of 

classes being taught virtually 
this semester, some STEM 
students 
are 
reporting 

overtime lectures and unfair 
work expectations, despite 
having 
regular 
schedules 

with assigned class times. 

Pharmacy student Sihyun 

Kim is currently enrolled 
in 
the 
course 
Medical 

Microbiology and Infectious 
Diseases. According to Kim, 
her 
instructor 
regularly 

exceeds the allotted lecture 
time by 20 minutes. 

“When some students told 

her that she needs to end 
the lecture on time so that 
students can get to their 
next 
(in-person) 
classes, 

she simply told them they 
can just leave and watch the 
recording later,” Kim said.

LSA 
junior 
Maddy 

McPherson 
shared 
Kim’s 

concerns regarding lectures 
going overtime. McPherson 
is currently taking a four-
credit biochemistry course 

with multiple lectures and a 
discussion each week. 

This 
semester, 
the 

course is formatted so that 
students can listen to pre-
recorded lectures when it is 
convenient for them. During 
the assigned lecture time, the 
professor holds an optional 
Q&A discussion that is also 
recorded for any student who 
is unable to attend. 

McPherson 
said 
this 

format has affected most 
of 
the 
duration 
of 
the 

course’s lectures by allowing 
instructors to teach over the 
time 
allotted. 
McPherson 

also 
expressed 
feeling 

obligated to attend the Q&A 
session in order to fully 
understand 
the 
material 

taught during lectures. 

“In a normal semester, 

we’re 
supposed 
to 
have 

lecture for two and a half 
hours 
and 
a 
discussion 

that’s about an hour and 
a half hours (per week),” 
McPherson said. “Now that 
the class is online, lectures 
are now going over time. 
Office hours are optional but 

help clarify the material, so it 
feels mandatory if you want 
to do well.”

With two lectures and 

a 
discussion 
that 
should 

each last 80 minutes, class 
time is expected to total to 
four hours each week, but 
McPherson said she found 
that she devoted nearly six 
and half hours of her week 
attending that single class, 
not including study time.

LSA 
professor 
Randy 

Stockbridge is one of the 
two 
instructors 
of 
an 

introductory 
biochemistry 

course. 
According 
to 

Stockbridge, 
about 
20 

percent of the class chooses 
to attend the instructor-led 
discussion portion of the 
course synchronously. More 
students choose to watch the 
recording later.

Stockbridge 
said 
the 

instructing team decided to 
format class time this way 
because they were hoping to 
give students another way to 
engage with the material and 
the professors. 

“Normally during a class 

period, we do active learning 
activities 
like 
iClicker 

questions 
and 
there’s 

the 
opportunity 
for 
the 

instructor to ask, ‘OK, does 
this make sense? Are there 
any questions at this point 
in the lecture?’” Stockbridge 
said. “We just don’t have 
that with the format where 
we just record lectures. We 
thought it would serve the 
students better to have sort 
of a standardized format in 
which these questions could 
be taken.”

Stockbridge said she was 

unaware of any complaints 
from students, but mentioned 
that the instructing team 
intends to hold a discussion 
later in the semester to 
address any concerns from 
students 
about 
the 
class 

format. 

Introduction to Electronic 

Circuits 
is 
another 
class 

that often extends over its 
allotted time, Engineering 
junior Emily Grim said. 

The course is four credits, 

and includes two lectures, 
one discussion and one lab 

to complete each week. The 
course instructor also posts 
pre-recorded 
videos 
for 

students to watch in advance 
of the lecture. 

Grim said the main issue 

with this format is a lack 
of clarity regarding what 
components of the class she 
should prioritize to succeed. 
With 
both 
pre-recorded 

videos 
and 
synchronous 

lectures, Grim said she has 
been struggling to keep up 
with the intense workload. 

“After a week of it, it was 

way too much work for me, so 
I decided to only watch the 
pre-lectures. The professor 
made it sound like they were 
the majority of the material, 
and the Zoom lectures were 
just doing examples,” Grim 
said. 

By 
not 
attending 
the 

synchronous lecture portion 
of the class, Grim believed 
that she had actually missed 
crucial 
information 
she 

would need to know to pass. 

“Turns 
out, 
the 
Zoom 

lectures 
had 
become 
the 

place where he was doing 

examples 
and 
covering 

important topics in more 
detail, despite saying you 
could 
asynchronously 
do 

the class with only the pre-
lectures,” Grim said. 

As an Engineering student 

with an already challenging 
course load, Grim said she 
was stressed about balancing 
her other courses given how 
much time she devotes to 
Introduction to Electronic 
Circuits. 

Grim said she feels like the 

workload would be lighter 
if she were taking the class 
during a normal semester.

“I wonder how different 

this 
class 
would 
be 
in 

person,” 
Grim 
said. 
“My 

professor 
mentioned 
that 

some 
material 
will 
be 

skipped over compared to 
previous semesters, yet it 
seems like there’s way more 
content in videos I have to 
parse through compared to 
the time I would’ve spent in 
person.”

Employees 
at 
Om 
of 

Medicine, a recreational and 
medicinal cannabis dispensary 
in 
downtown 
Ann 
Arbor, 

have received backlash from 
management for forming a union, 
according to both former and 
current employees. Employees 
allege this backlash has included 
the firing of three prominent 
pro-union 
employees 
along 

with increased surveillance and 
stricter standards for employees 
still at the store.

On Sept. 23, employees at Om 

sent a letter of recognition to the 
company’s leadership, requesting 
the company acknowledge the 
formation of the union. This 
would 
allow 
employees 
to 

create a formal unit to bargain 
collectively with management to 
secure wages and benefits, create 
a safe workplace environment, 
discuss racial injustices and 
address other issues important 
to the workers at Om. 

In the letter, employees urged 

the company to swiftly recognize 
their union and refrain from 
holding compulsory employee 
meetings espousing anti-union 
rhetoric. 

“We ask that you commit to 

a fair and cooperative process 
as we move forward together,” 
the letter reads. “This means 
avoiding 
outside 
anti-union 

consultants and lawyers who 
might attempt to bully, threaten 
or instill fear among us. It means 
not 
scheduling 
compulsory 

captive 
audience 
meetings 

where we are forced to listen to 
anti-union rhetoric. It means 
respecting our rights and our 
carefully considered decision to 
unionize.”

Om leadership denied the 

demands 
to 
recognize 
the 

union and will instead initiate 
a fair and anonymous election 
process 
under 
the 
National 

Labor Relations Act to formally 
recognize the union.

Shortly after the letter was 

delivered to management, three 
Om employees were fired from 
the company. 

Lisa 
Conine, 
former 

Om 
community 
outreach 

coordinator for more than four 
years and one of the employees 
let go from the company, said the 
employees hoped management 
would 
recognize 
the 
union 

as a way to open discussion 
around 
employee 
working 

environments. Conine said the 
decision to fire employees for 
sending the letter was a strong 
message to the community that 

they no longer supported the 
employees’ involvement in social 
justice work. 

“They fired us and tried 

to escort us out almost like 
criminals,” Conine said. “I’ve 
been there for four years, and 
they tried to make me leave out 
the back door with an escort, and 
it was very, very painful.”

That same day, the cannabis 

store closed early, and employees 
protested outside of the store, 
leading many to question the 
future of the company.

A current employee at Om, 

who 
requested 
to 
remain 

anonymous 
due 
to 
fear 
of 

retaliation from their employer, 
said the workplace environment 

completely shifted when the 
letter of recognition was sent to 
management. 

“We know they’re watching us 

constantly,” the employee said. 
“It makes me personally feel very 
paranoid. I feel like I can’t step 
the wrong way without being 
told I’m doing the wrong thing.”

Mark Passerini, co-founder of 

Om, told The Daily in an email 
statement that providing a safe 
and fair working environment 
for Om employees is a critical 
point in their mission as a 
company. 

“Our Omies are not only 

valued 
members 
of 
our 

community, they are the people 
vital to fulfilling our mission,” 

Passerini wrote. “We strive to 
make our Omies proud of their 
place of employment.”

In April 2019, Om was acquired 

by 
4Front 
Venture 
Mission 

Dispensaries, 
a 
nation-wide 

cannabis investment company. 
Since the new transition, Conine 
said there has been difficulty 
in maintaining Om’s values to 
remain focused on the patients, 
the medicinal side of care and 
educating customers on cannabis 
treatment.

“Quickly, it became pretty 

evident that the goal of the 
company was to be more just 
operations-focused, efficiently-
focused, focused on revenue,” 
Conine said. “And so we’ve been 

speaking up and kind of pushing 
back on a lot of changes, ever 
since the beginning.”

4Front directed The Daily to 

Passerini’s statement. 

Passerini said Om is one 

of 
the 
longest 
operating 

dispensaries in the country 
and is dedicated to advancing 
cannabis reform and serving 
its patients and customers with 
quality cannabis products in a 
safe and responsible manner. 

“Om of Medicine is also 

committed to equal employment 
opportunity, treating everyone 
fairly 
and 
maintaining 

an 
environment 
free 
of 

discrimination, 
harassment 

and 
intimidation,” 
Passerini 

wrote. “Om of Medicine strictly 
prohibits conduct from anyone 
— including customers — that 
violates this policy. While we 
do not comment on personnel 
matters, 
our 
employment 

decisions are consistent with 
our mission, values and policies.”

A key reason for deciding 

to unionize has been issues 
surrounding 
race 
at 
the 

dispensary, 
particularly 
in 

light of the summer’s protests 
surrounding the police killing of 
George Floyd, says Ana Gomulka, 
the former social equity program 
coordinator at Om and one of the 
three employees let go from the 
company. 

A flashpoint for employees 

came this summer when a 
former 
delivery 
driver, 
who 

was Black, asked for permission 
to forgo a delivery to a more 
conservative suburb in the area 
because he worried about his 
safety as a Black man who would 
be carrying multiple ounces 
of marijuana in a vehicle, even 
though it was legal. The manager 
at the time, however, refused the 
request and made the delivery 
driver complete the delivery 
anyway, after which employees 
decided to start organizing and 
having conversations. 

“We took action as a team, the 

employees and said, you know, 
this is not okay,” Gomulka said 
“We held a space for each other 

to talk about what actions we 
needed to see from corporate 
moving forward in order to 
feel safe and secure in our own 
workspace.” 

Gomulka and other employees 

were eventually successful in 
getting managers at the store 
level to undergo implicit racial 
bias training, but not in getting 
members of the board and 
corporate leadership to do the 
same, as they had hoped.

In addition to the episode 

with the delivery driver, another 
point of tension Gomulka and 
other employees have had with 
the board and store leadership 
has been their refusal to put 
out a statement in support of 

Black Lives Matter, something 
dozens of companies did in the 
aftermath of the George Floyd 
protests. 

For Gomulka, the lack of a 

public statement surrounding 
Black 
Lives 
Matter 
was 

particularly concerning given 
the 
racial 
makeup 
of 
the 

leadership of the company. 

“All 
leadership 
in 
this 

company is white and this is a 
national 
company,” 
Gomulka 

said. 
“The 
entire 
board 
is 

white, all the investors are 
white, and we confronted them 
and we said you know this is a 
problem for us because there’s 
no 
representation. 
We 
need 

representation and we need an 

actual public statement about 
Black Lives Matter, and the 
company refused to put it out. 
They told us that they didn’t 
want to be political.”

4Front Ventures CEO Leo 

Gontmakher eventually sent out 
a company-wide email, which 
was obtained by The Daily, 
commenting 
on 
Black 
Lives 

Matter and the protests. While 
the statement acknowledged the 
disproportionate 
incarceration 

of people of color for drug crimes 
and said the company “stand(s) 
in solidarity with the peaceful 
protestors helping bring large 
numbers of people out of their 
state of complacency,” employees 
like Gomulka were upset by the 
statement’s final paragraph in 
which Gontmakher seemed to 
argue that people of differing 
viewpoints smoking cannabis 
together could help to heal the 
racial divide. 

“This 
letter 
was 
very 

insensitive … it basically said, 
you know, at the end of the day, 
if we could all smoke a joint 
together, racism would go away,” 
Gomulka said. 

The final paragraph of the 

statement read, “And not to 
trivialize the matters at hand, 
but one is left to wonder what 
would happen if some of these 
communities in opposition could 
sit down and share a joint and 
talk it out, taking advantage of 
one of the appealing attributes 
of cannabis. We all have so much 
more in common than we have in 
difference.” 

The 
unwillingness 
of 

4Front and Om to make public 
statements about Black Lives 
Matter, even if in an effort to 
refrain from being political, 
is 
particularly 
upsetting 
to 

Gomulka because the issue of 
the 
prohibition 
of 
cannabis 

and racism are fundamentally 
connected.

“They’re making money off of 

a plant that has really devastated 
Black communities, and all they 
have to do is acknowledge and 
give back, and their refusal 
to do that has really made it 
an uncomfortable and unsafe 
environment for their Black (and) 
Brown 
employees,” 
Gomulka 

said. “When Black men are going 
to prison at unfathomable rates, 
things we’re still dealing with 
to this day, but we have large 
corporations buying everything 
up and demanding that they 
refuse to be political because of 
their white power, because of the 
position and privilege they’re in, 
it becomes a very large issue.”

tify drone attacks in Muslim 
parts of the Global South. I will 
also not paint for you an image 
of a weak and fragile Mus-
lim female population, for we 
are anything but frail. If you 
clicked on this based on that 
assumption, you will be sore-
ly dismayed and should close 
the page. If you would like to 
read about a strong system of 
male patriarchy in the Muslim 
world and the harm it causes 
women as well as its detrimen-
tal effect on the fight for politi-
cal resistance, please carry on. 
Also, to my Muslim brothers, if 
you feel like I have to say not all 
Muslim men, you are a part of 
the problem.

Once during Sunday school 

I had dropped something on 
the floor and bent to pick it 
up, only to quickly get scolded 
that I should not be bending 
down so seductively, surely 
I did not want to give a man 
that sort of invitation. I was 
only twelve. However horrid 
the scolding may appear, these 
microaggressions are the fes-
tering effects of the Haram 
Police, a patriarchy attempting 
to acquire power amid the rise 
of global feminism. Haram; 
meaning strictly forbidden by 
Islamic dogma and police are 
two specific words that com-
bined emphasize a growing 
male dominance on Muslim 
women. Starting off as a mere 
joke within Muslim diaspora, 
the phrase has embodied active 
misogyny hell-bent on exerting 
control over Muslim women 
and is prevalent throughout 
the entire Muslim world. The 
Haram Police, aptly named 
for the violence it has inflict-
ed on Muslim women around 
the globe, has reigned terror 
on the very women they claim 
to protect and care for. Often 
and arguably rightfully so, 
Muslim women focus on impe-
rial threats rather than looking 
among those within our spaces, 
but unfortunately the silent 
oppressor of the Haram Police 
cripples our missions with its 

deadly misogyny. Inaccurately 
masqueraded 
as 
religiously 

driven, the Haram Police con-
tinues to tear down women, 
both hurting their sisters in 
faith while hindering their col-
lective fights against political 
injustice.

The internet, like other hate 

groups, is the Haram Police’s 
weapon of choice. Facebook 
and Youtube accounts metic-
ulously 
crafted 
to 
feature 

women shaming as their main 
monetized content. Pretending 
to care about religion, the Ben 
Shapiros 
of 
the 

Muslim 
world 
log 
on 

to 
their 

plat-
forms to 
shame 
Muslim 
women 
about 
their 
cloth-
ing, their 
manner-
isms and 
if appli-
cable, 
their 
romantic 
relation-
ships. 
Often 
times, 
they 
play 
a 

video or 
clip they 
deem to 
be sinful 
— which 
seems 
awfully 
counter-
intuitive 
to 
their 

brand — and use their social 
prowess to argue why they 
believe the Muslim woman is 
a sinner. They closely monitor 
Muslim influencers on Insta-
gram and if they post a photo 
as innocuous as a headshot, 
they portray the image and 
claim that these women are 
devilish, purposefully entic-
ing men to sin. Committed to a 
brand of demonizing their own 
sisters, they do not discrimi-
nate against which woman to 
attack. Veiled, unveiled, mar-
ried, single, Arab, Desi, Black, 
their commentary is universal-
ly applied as they defend their 
argument that every Muslim 
woman who does not whole-
heartedly 
commit 
to 
their 

Islamic interpretation of femi-

ninity is a woman determined 
to rot in the depths of hell. 
While this may seem dramatic 
to a majority American audi-
ence, this type of language is 
broadcasted daily to constant 
viewers all over the world, 
with view counts as high as 
in the millions. Like all social 
commentary, it has had a direct 
impact on society and in this 
case, Muslim women are the 
chosen victims. 

A painfully prevalent exam-

ple is a current case in Egypt. 
Nine women, mostly in their 

20s, have been detained by 
Egyptain courts for “violating 
family values.” This absurd 
claim has been a raging result 
of a long standing culture war 
over belly dancers and Egyp-
tian pop stars, the TikTok 
case the most severe retalia-
tion against claims of west-
ernization. Two women have 
already been indicted and have 
been given a two year prison 
sentence, merely for enjoying 
their time on the social media 
powerhouse. 
The 
Egyptian 

prison system, like America’s, 
is a system designed to control 
every voice the government 
wants to subvert. Orwellian in 
its cutthroat oppression, the 
court system utilizes unjust 
tacticts to torture civilians 

like starvation, rape and stark 
humiliation. As they squash 
voices of opposition, the Egyp-
tian 
government 
has 
been 

determined to appear to care 
about so-called family values 
to hide their classist oppres-
sion of Egyptian civilians. In 
the eyes of a court designed 
to uphold the wealthy and 
crumble 
the 
impoverished, 

these women, similar to Charli 
D’Amelio in their TikTok con-
tent, are guilty solely of anger-
ing the conservative sect of the 
Egyptian population, a popula-

tion the government seeks to 
appease politically. Increas-
ingly heartbreaking, some of 
these women, severely affected 
by government-driven poverty, 
turned to TikTok as a money 
making mechanism to support 
their families. Their imprison-
ment does not just affect them, 
rather it leaves homes without 
their breadwinners, starving 
not only the alleged offenders 
but their families: a true viola-
tion of family values. Symbolic 
of the blatant endorsement of 
rape culture and victim blam-
ing within these corrupt gover-
ments as well as a persistent 
class war, these women remain 
tangible proof that Muslim 
women are suffocated by an 
obsessive patriarchy. In their 

attempt to quiet these nine 
women, Egypt’s government, 
in tandem with the Haram 
Police, have scarred their lives 
to purposefully and politically 
prop them up as examples for 
any woman who dares have a 
voice that does not mirror the 
patriarch’s.

The Haram Police does not 

only harm Muslim women, it is 
a double edged sword slaugh-
tering possibilities of politi-
cal resistance. Continuing the 
case study on Egypt, Donald 
J. Trump’s “favorite dictator”, 

Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, contin-
ues to reign Egypt by ruthless-
ly 
slaughtering 
political 

opponents and their children. 
With one US dollar equating to 
approximately sixteen Egyp-
tian pounds, the poverty rate is 
only increasing and infrastruc-
ture is severely lacking as the 
wealthy, including the politi-
cal elite such as El-Sisi, prof-
iting off of the labor of poor 
Egyptian citizens. Constantly 
crushing male and female pro-
testers against the regime with 
a hardened military, Egypt 
solidified itself as a military 
state and has caused irrepara-
ble damage to the nation. Men 
and women alike have fled to 
the streets aching for desper-
ate change only to have their 

blood flow endlessly, the state 
of freedom so dire that I may 
be barring myself from visiting 
my family as an Egyptian citi-
zen just writing this fact. Mus-
lim Egyptian men weaponizing 
the courts against their fel-
low female comrades are only 
strengthening the power of a 
dominating elite. By heightin-
ing government power, they 
are actively engaged in tight-
ening the noose around their 
necks, 
effectively 
cutting 

themselves from any possibil-
ity of desperate change. Rather 

than standing side by 
side as they have during 
massive political revolu-
tions such as in the Arab 
Spring, some cowardly, 
insecure men have cho-
sen to empower their 
oppressor 
to 
silence 

their allies rather than 
stand with their Mus-
lim sisters in solidarity. 
By stabbing them in the 
back, the Haram Police 
effectively cuts itself as 
well, their misogyny an 
unintentioned yet skill-
ful silencer of necessary 
political revolutions.

Egypt is only a case 

study 
as 
the 
Haram 

Police continues to ter-
rorize women who have 
already been dealt a 
politically 
gruesome 

hand worldwide. Ameri-
cans are not immune 
from the Haram Police’s 
wrath with even strong 
Muslim 
leaders 
like 

Ilhan Omar and Rashi-
da Tlaib getting harped 
on for not wearing a 
hijab, or not wearing 
their hijabs “properly.” 
Their misogyny clear, 
the Haram police is only 
furthering sexist chau-

vinism against Muslim women 
rather than promoting piety, 
deepening the Muslim counter-
part of a worldwide patriarchi-
cal system. Like other cultural 
apparatuses, the Haram Police 
have been exploited by their 
oppressors as an inner poi-
sonous dynamic. If the Haram 
Police genuinely want a more 
just world as Islam dictates, 
they need to give their fellow 
sisters their support rather 
than their venom. Until then, 
Muslim 
women 
are 
strong 

enough to look into our own 
spaces and fight two ardent 
oppressors; our brothers alle-
giant to the Haram Police and 
our colonizers.

After the sad realization 

that I won’t be able to meet 
anyone 
new 
“organically” 

in the near future sank in, I 
finally caved last week and 
joined some of my friends on 
Tinder. I wasn’t looking for 
love: It was one of those point-
less activities I did in order 
to avoid the mass of assign-
ments I would eventually have 
to plow through at break-neck 
speed. Tinder is essentially a 
way to make dating a mind-
less game with no hard feel-
ings and no real stakes. It’s 
an innovative marvel for the 
bored and lonely community, 
of which I am a long-stand-
ing member, whose cultural 
implications instantly fasci-
nated me. Also, it was just fun.

But at some point in the 

midst of desultory swipes and 
disappointing openers, every 
person of color on a dating app 
asks themselves the question: 
Is my race affecting my match-
es? I have to come to terms 
with the fact that there are 
people everywhere, not just 
within the confines of Tin-
der, who will like me less or a 
little too much solely because 
I am an East Asian American 

woman. 

I understand it’s naive to 

assume that people are color-
blind, and I also don’t want 
them to be colorblind. I want 
my race to be recognized, 
heard and celebrated. I want 
people to acknowledge that 
my experiences are different 
from theirs and these expe-
riences have influenced the 
way I see the world, but they 
like me still, maybe even more 
because of it. I want them to 
care enough to listen to me 
and try to empathize with a 
life, an entire culture outside 
of their own. I detest people 
who “refuse to see color” 
because my color matters to 
me. I am proud of it and I need 
it to be seen.

I also don’t want to be 

considered a novelty. I don’t 
want my appeal relegated to 
an otaku’s fetish, and I don’t 
want to receive kimonos for 
my birthday. I hate feeling 
exoticized and the sneaking 
suspicion that I am just a new 
experience for these men rath-
er than a human being. Even-
tually, you learn the ropes and 
search for signs in people’s 
profiles. 
Self-proclaimed 

“sushi and boba lovers” are on 
probation and anyone who’s 
chosen to include “lets watch 

anime together” in their bio is 
an instant red flag. 

If they’re cute and they 

seem to check out, you swipe 
right, 
and 
maybe 
they’ve 

swiped right back on you. 
These matches are generally 
followed by awkward conver-
sations via in-app messaging. 
Being a woman of color on Tin-
der, you tend to amass horror 
stories. I am asked out to “pho 
or sushi” dinners, I have been 
super-liked by a man with 
“free match if your asian” in 
his bio. Non-Asian men proud-
ly text me “i like me a asian 
girl” with heart-eye emojis or 
“tbh i prefer asians to white 
girls” as if they’re civil rights 
heroes. When someone once 
told me he’d never been with 
an Asian girl before and he 
was “tryna break the seal,” I 
had to make a conscious effort 
not to throw up or throw my 
whole phone in the trash. See-
ing my heritage, my proud 
history, my rich culture, my 
parents’ sacrifices and my 
people’s 
constant 
struggle 

reduced and watered down to 
one man’s “idk something bout 
yall just does it for me” makes 
me feel sick. We did not come 
here for this. It is disrespect-
ful and just plain wrong to 
steal away our humanity with 

your tokenism.

But I am happy to report 

that my experiences with mes-
saging men on Tinder have 
largely been free of unneces-
sary mentions of my race or 
the size of their penises. Mes-
sages are, however, assailed by 
awkward miscommunications 
about intention and physical 
boundaries — “i dont do hook 
ups sorry king” — and annoy-
ing insistences on asking for 
socials. (Real adults shouldn’t 
use Snapchat, but I digress.) 
On the off chance that talk-
ing actually goes well though, 
you end up going on dates, and 
those are an entirely different 
anxiety behemoth altogether.

A good friend once told 

me that going on dates with 
strangers is “terrible — so, so, 
so terrible — but kind of fun.” 
Dating during a pandemic is 
even worse. It’s preceded by 
the awkward, yet obligatory 
“uh do you have coronavirus 
LOL” text you send to assuage 
your fears that this is a hor-
rible idea. Wearing masks is 
a necessary precaution whose 
main side-effect is creating 
situations that feel almost 
purely platonic. Dating now is 
even more difficult for women 
to navigate because our pre-
vailing logic surrounding first 

dates is to go to public spaces 
where there are a lot of people 
around for safety. As some-
one who has spent the last 
half decade on a steady diet 
of “Law and Order: SVU,” I’m 
thoroughly freaked out when I 
find myself in a secluded park 
off-campus on date number 
two.

Thankfully, no one has tried 

to murder me yet, but dates 
are often bogged down by 
excruciatingly fluffy, insipid 
conversation about favorite 
rappers and TV shows. If race 
comes up on a date, which isn’t 
often, I feel the other person 
over-compensating 
for 
our 

differences in ways that make 
me uncomfortable. I’ve heard 
that “the only race is the 
human race,” and I don’t know 
how to open my mouth and say 
that, yes, we are biologically 
the same, but we have cultural 
differences and are, indeed, 
separated by racism. There is 
more that connects us than 
divides us, but we are not one 
and the same. There should be 
nothing to fear in that gap, but 
there is so much to learn.

I know it’s pointless, but 

I still scroll through Tinder 
once in a while out of boredom. 
I feel guilty for participat-
ing in this superficial system 

and I hate swiping right on 
a guy whose best bio, of all 
the phrases in the English 
language, is “6’1” since that 
counts as personality.” Trying 
to walk that fine line between 
platonic 
and 
corny 
texts 

stresses me out, and the sight 
of sunburnt men who genu-
inely believe women go wild 
over pictures of them holding 
fish on a boat frustrates me. 
But, while I don’t take Tinder 
seriously, I do care about my 
racial identity, and I am tired 
by the knowledge that my race 
plays a factor in every experi-
ence I have, dating certainly 
being no exception. My agency 
in these situations, however, 
gives me hope: I can unmatch 
with every creep I encounter 
or aim expletives at men with 
classic cases of yellow fever. 
An odd satisfaction lies in 
this power to refuse. Online 
dating is annoyingly uninhib-
ited at times, but the ability 
to instantly pick and choose 
at one’s discretion, free of any 
consequences, is an invaluable 
tool for women of color in the 
dating realm, because the real 
world is rarely so kind to us. 
And in the words of Luke, 21, 
less than a mile away from me, 
I just think that’s “pretty cash 
money, cute little fine thang.”

Tinder and 
Tokenism:

Dating for East Asian American Women

The harm of the Haram Police


Wednesday, October 7, 2020 — 7
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com
Michigan In Color

The very existence of the United 

States of America presents itself 
as perhaps one of the most con-
founding paradoxes. A country that 
claims a perfectly veneered founda-
tion of life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness, interstate highways 
tarred with gold and a guarantee of 
the ever-fleeting American dream. 
This is a country that is simultane-
ously founded on the backs of Indig-
enous peoples, immigrants and 
Black Americans — on marginal-
ized communities whose contribu-
tions constitute the leather binding 
that establishes this nation’s nar-
rative. While the pages of this nar-
rative are slick with their blood, 
sweat, and tears, I’ve found that the 
complexities and intricacies of their 
history are consistently excluded 
from the story that has come to 
define All-Americana. Nonethe-
less, the majority of U.S. History 
courses I’ve taken seem to accept 
this account as a baseline standard 
in the classroom. This begs the 
question of whether neglecting to 
rawly and honestly teach said com-
munities the jarring truth that this 
nation was once a colonizer state 
— deriving its power from ethnic 
cleansing, the bloody bondages of 
slavery, and widespread imperial-
ism — is a product of pure altruistic 
intent, an attempt to shield our chil-
dren from the harshness of reality. 
Or rather, is this ahistoric failure a 

tragic and deliberate miseducation 
of the masses; a strategic maneu-
ver bred from the knowledge that 
a thorough education serves as the 
unofficial language of revolution, 
capable of deteriorating the power 
that characterizes a modern day 
portrait of America

At the forefront of a growing 

movement towards rectifying the 
falsities that countless Boards of 
Education have deemed a proper 
recollection of American history is 
the African American Integration 
Initiative (AAII), a new student 
organization at the University of 
Michigan. AAII aims to draft state 
legislation that would require 
increased hiring of educators of 
color, an unreserved and forthright 
teaching of African American his-
tory, and racial ethics in order to 
emphasize an essential truth: that 
there is simply no American history 
without African American history. 
I spoke with LSA freshman AAII 
founder, Shelbie Taylor, and LSA 
freshmen team leaders Vicky Wang 
and Monica Khalique to gain a full 
understanding of what led to the 
conception of AAII, its organiza-
tional hierarchy, and how such a 
student organization fits within the 
complex framework of a predomi-
nantly white institution. 

In the wake of George Floyd’s 

murder,riots soon followed. Taylor 
spoke to me about activism fatigue 
and a summer of America on fire.
Taylor tells me she was compelled 
to make a tangible change, to 
drive a new sort of racial reckon-

ing. Much more deeply though, for 
Taylor, the genesis of AAII was not 
only a testament to the reality that 
racism is an early product of igno-
rance and the manifestation of an 
education gone wrong. It was also 
an amendment to a childhood of 
gritted teeth, clenched fists, and 
inky blue lonelinessbecause more 
often than not, Taylor had lived a 
grating existence of being the only 
Black student on any given day in 
any given room. 

AAII is a well-oiled, complex 

machine, consisting of three parts: 
Data Gathering, Networking and 
Allyship, and Marketing and Public 
Image. Taylor leads Data Gathering, 
in which members collect budding 
statistical data, surveying students 
on the extent of their knowledge 
surrounding 
African 
American 

history. The goal is to build an all 
encompassing curriculum tailored 
to their responses. Taylor tells me 
she expects these results to serve 
as tangible proof of an education 
system in need of dire reform. 
Monica Khalique is team leader of 
Networking and Allyship, the sec-
tor of AAII dedicated to reaching 
out to professors and administra-
tors at the university with the intent 
of establishing a presence and 
gaining endorsement and mentor-
ship opportunities. Vicky Wang is 
co-leader of the Marketing/Public 
Image team, which aims to amplify 
AAII’s presence as a student orga-
nization on campus through social 
media and campaign initiatives. A 
typical AAII meeting consists not 

only of brute groundwork through 
data gathering and analysis, it also 
serves as a safe haven for many of 
those shunned by the dividing lines 
of America. It is a space to discuss 
the disturbing stratifications of 
race and occurences of racism that 
have been shoved in the backs of 
filing cabinets and under yellowed 
manila folders. Moreover, Wang 
and Khalique speak of a life riddled 
with microaggressions and a lack of 
representation. Both describe grap-
pling with the difficult task of defin-
ing what it means to be a woman 
of color amid the perils of a world 
that seemingly wasn’t designed 
for them. Wang tells me that even 
in Ann Arbor, a community that 
lauds itself as one of the epicenters 
of social change and progression 
in the midwest, her run-ins with 
prejudice are still potent. Only here, 
though, they are slyly leveled under 
the table, presenting themselves in 
shifty eyes, altered body language 
and ultimately a crippling sense of 
discomfort in every corner of the 
city. 

Looking forward, AAII aims to 

go beyond drafting a new curricu-
lum and passing state legislation, 
solidifying its place at the Uni-
versity of Michigan as a student 
organization that serves as the 
next generation’s counselor, men-
tor and teacher that Taylor, Wang, 
Khalique, and young kids like them 
had never had. AAII and similar 
alliances are crucial in rearing the 
broken and racially skewed Ameri-
can education system. 

Help! My name is gone

and I can’t breathe
Let me stand, please!

Shh…

Let us stand

Now that he is dead let’s degrade

His only human mistakes
Let’s put him on a pedestal 

And play God

Recount his sins

Tattoo his broken neck

He shall not see the sacred kingdom

Of white Jesus

If I have anything to do with it

He resisted nearly 500 years of damnation 

and police badges

Let me remind you that law is in my hands

And I ruled the death penalty

But please

don’t praise me yet

There’s only so much I can do

To protect white America
From being taken by slaves.

They’ll be dead before 

judgement day

Or imprisoned for their Black crime.

We are all doing our parts
Take up your MAGA hats

To praise Trump for refusing

To put that n*****’s portrait in our history

And let us race over Black Lives Matter

Leave it sprawled on the streets like roadkill
For Justice is only a white man’s affordance

And our system proves that they 

Never belonged here in the first place

‘500 years of damnation, 

let me stand’

By now, the death of 87-year-

old Supreme Court Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Sept. 
18 
has 
reverberated 
across 

hundreds of millions of Ameri-
can homes, leaving many filled 
with anguish, uncertainty and 
concern about the state of the 
highest court in the nation. 
Inducted in 1993 by President 
Bill Clinton, Ginsburg was the 
first Jewish female, and sec-
ond female ever, to serve on 
the Supreme Court. With Gins-
burg’s death and lifetime terms 
for Justices, the Supreme Court 
is at risk of having a partisan 
and ideological unbalance for 
generations to come. Judge 
Amy Coney Barett, President 
Trump’s nomination to replace 
Justice Ginsburg, is almost 
entirely noted to be conserva-
tive on immigration, abortion, 
racial equity and a host of other 
interrelated issues.

While confirmation hearings 

for Judge Barett are set to be 
held in October, today, we can 
mourn the loss of an incredible 
activist. In Jewish tradition, 
the Kaddish, a Jewish prayer 
recited during Jewish prayer 
services and associated with 
death and mourning, is tradi-
tionally recited by immediate 
family members, yet an out-
pouring of grief for Ginsburg 
led to a recitation by hundreds 
on the steps of the Supreme 
Court the Friday of her passing.

In a similar vein, we can all 

take a moment to remember 
Justice Ginsburg, most power-
fully by looking at three of her 
most notable impacts in her 
time on the bench.

A mere three years after 

Ginsburg joined the Supreme 
Court, a 1996 case challenged 
the all-male admissions policy 
at the Virginia Military Insti-
tute, which was at the time one 
of the last remaining all-male 
public undergraduate colleges 
in the country. This all changed 
when Ginsburg came. With her 
leadership, Ginsberg wrote a 
majority opinion ensuring that 
the Equal Protection Clause 
of the 14th Amendment of the 
Constitution was constitution-
ally practiced and the abolish-
ment of the gender-exclusive 
policy at Virginia Military 
Institute. The impact of this 
ruling continues to stand today, 
allowing opportunities for per-
sons of all genders to enter pub-
lic institutions without the fear 
of de jure gender discrimina-
tion on their heels. 

The court, led by Ginsburg, 

would require the state-fund-
ed school to accept women 
for admission as well as an 
enforcement of equal consid-
erations of all genders. In the 
opinion of United States v. Vir-
ginia, Ginsburg wrote “neither 
the goal of producing citizen 
soldiers nor VMI’s implement-
ing methodology is inherently 

unsuitable to women,” leading 
the way for women across the 
country to apply to universities 
they would have never been 
able to in the past. 

Three years after this case 

came the landmark case that 
focused on a strict violation 
of the “integration mandate,” 
which, under the Americans 

with Disabilities Act of 1990 
(ADA), requires state and local 
governments to “administer 
services, programs, and activi-
ties in the most integrated set-
ting appropriate to the needs 
of qualified individuals with 
disabilities.” In this situation, 
two women plaintiffs with 
mental illnesses and develop-

mental disabilities were kept 
confined in the state-run Geor-
gia Regional Hospital for years 
even after being deemed medi-
cally ready to move to a com-
munity-based program.

Ginsburg penned a fiery 

majority opinion that ruled 
in favor of the two women 
and emphasized the extreme 

importance of rights for all per-
sons with disabilities, includ-
ing but not limited to mental, 
developmental 
and 
physical 

disabilities. In her words, Gins-
burg noted that the isolation of 
the two plaintiffs unjustifying-
ly “perpetuates assumptions 
that persons so isolated are 
incapable or unworthy of par-
ticipating in community life.” 
This adherence of the ADA, led 
by Ginsburg, allowed persons 
with disabilities to continue 
living integrated lives in a soci-
ety that is so conditioned to the 
able-bodied individual.

More 
recently, 
in 
2015, 

another landmark case put 
Ginsburg in the history books 
as same-sex marriage became 
a right across all 50 states. 
Ginsburg all her life had been 
a major advocate for LGBTQ+ 
rights 
and 
even 
officiated 

same-sex weddings here and 
there, making this case in par-
ticular of special importance in 
her illustrious career. The case 
revolved again around the 14th 
Amendment and its ability to 
ensure persons rights to equal 
protection and due process, in 
light of state bans in Michi-
gan, Kentucky, Ohio and Ten-
nessee which denied marriage 
between people of the same 
sex.

Though she did not write the 

majority opinion this time, Jus-
tice Anthony Kennedy noted in 
his own majority opinion, “the 
limitation of marriage to oppo-
site-sex couples may long have 
seemed natural and just, but its 
inconsistency with the central 
meaning of the fundamental 
right to marry is now mani-
fest.” This ruling was especial-
ly notable because Ginsburg 
directly called out the regres-
sive attitude of John Bursuch, 
the lawyer representing the 
states, and was able to con-
vince Justice Kennedy to flip, 
overturning his questioning 
of marital tradition. In doing 
so, hundreds of thousands of 
LGBTQ+ Americans are able to 
be married today.

While these cases are three 

out of dozens of cases Justice 
Ginsburg had a positive role 
in, Ginburgs stands for more 
than just her decisions in the 
legal realm. Her long career 
stands as a reminder that quali-
ties that were once deemed as 
undeserving of equal treat-
ment are truly valuable. From 
fighting for gender equality 
and marginalized communities 
whose voices often aren’t heard 
to battling against anti-Sem-
itism, Ginsburg has inspired 
a generation of activists for 
decades to come.

JUSTICE GINSBURG VIA WIKIMEDIA COMMONS


Opinion

The 
Energy 
Information 

Administration 
estimates 
that 

utilities are the biggest source of 
carbon emissions in Michigan at 
36.5%. Within utilities, the EIA 
estimates that 92%of the state’s 
electricity is produced from non-
renewable energy sources, with 
4 out of 10 power plants running 
on coal. Even though wind energy 
production, the largest source of 
renewable energy in Michigan, has 
more than quadrupled between 
2012 and 2019, wind energy still 
only amounts to an abysmal 5%of 
the state’s electricity production. 
EGLE should come up with a 
clear plan on helping utilities 
generate more renewable power 
and have legal provisions to hold 
utility companies accountable to 
their goals. While it helps that 
Michigan’s two largest utilities 
announced plans in 2017 to cut 
down carbon emissions, with 
DTE Energy in particular stating 
it would go carbon neutral by 
2050, such targets will remain 
unachievable 
without 
sound 

regulatory support and oversight 
through instruments like tax 
breaks, carbon pricing or power 
purchase 
agreements. 
The 

executive directive doesn’t give 
any insights into these policy 
elements.

Beyond utilities, transportation 

is the second largest source of 
emissions in the state at 32.4 
percent. This high percentage 
poses 
two 
problems. 
First, 

Michigan 
has 
limited 
public 

transportation facilities and is 
highly dependent on automotive 
vehicles for personal travel. To 
significantly reduce emissions, 
Michigan either has to provide 
an 
exhaustive 
and 
efficient 

public 
transportation 
system 

or promote the use of electric 
cars with an extensive charging 
infrastructure. 
Both 
options 

require targeted and rapid action 
by the government and auto 
manufacturers.

Second, the Michigan auto 

industry 
directly 
employed 

291,000 workers in 2017 and 
contributed 
to 
$157 
billion 

to the state’s economy. With 
California, 
New 
Jersey 
and 

several other states recently 
announcing plans to promote 
electric vehicles, these jobs 
are likely to be affected if auto 
manufacturers do not invest in 
electric cars. Michigan will also 
lose a portion of the $4 billion 
in state and local corporate 
taxes the auto industry pays 
(as of 2017) if the industry fails 
to adapt. EGLE’s plan should 
therefore 
carefully 
balance 

public convenience, employment 
opportunities 
and 
economic 

impact 
while 
still 
pursuing 

an 
aggressive 
path 
towards 

carbon neutrality. While it is 
encouraging that the executive 
order asks the Department of 
Treasury to “explore taxation 
and revenue strategies to fit 
Michigan’s 
changing 
energy 

production mix” and minimize 
loss of employment, it remains to 
be seen if the plan will deliver on 
those directives. 

Additionally, one thing that 

any environmental plan needs to 
consider is the disproportionate 
impact 
that 
environmental 

damage has on people of color 
and low-income communities. 
Just this past August, EGLE 
began 
an 
investigation 
into 

whether it violated the civil 
rights of East Detroit, a primarily 
low-income, 
non-white 
area, 

by allowing the expansion of a 
massive toxic waste plant that 
had already violated numerous 
safety regulations in the area, 
endangering the residents of the 
community. While this instance 
does not directly involve climate 
change, it shows a blind spot 
within EGLE to the hazardous 
effects 
of 
environmental 

waste and pollution that are 
disproportionately 
placed 
in 

poor and minority communities. 
It is of utmost importance that 
if EGLE undertakes the large 
project 
of 
achieving 
carbon 

neutrality by 2050, which it 
absolutely should, EGLE also 
makes a concerted effort to 
combat environmental racism in 
all of its forms, as environmental 
justice must be a part of any 
effective plan to address climate 
change.

Apart from policy measures 

to 
curb 
emissions 
from 

corporate 
bodies, 
the 
plan 

should also encourage citizens 
to take individual steps to reduce 
emissions. An example of an 
individual step is reducing use 
of private vehicles by carpooling 
or using public transportation. 
Michigan should take inspiration 
from 
California’s 
High 

Occupancy Vehicle lane policy, 
for instance, which encourages 
citizens to carpool and drive 
electric cars. Another personal 
step 
is 
reducing 
per-capita 

meat consumption. The meat 
industry is responsible for 14.5% 
of greenhouse gas emissions 
annually. This high number is 
because, first, making space 
for farms and livestock clears 
trees, which results in a large 
amount of carbon being released. 
Second, cows, sheep and goats 
release high levels of methane 
through feces and burps. Third, 
99% of farmed animals live on 
factory farms, which use fossil 
fuels to power their machinery, 
make fertilizer and ship their 
products around the world. Even 
if completely cutting out on meat 
is not a viable option for each 
individual, just reducing beef 
consumption can make a huge 
difference: For each 50 grams of 
protein, beef production emits 
17.7 kg of CO2 compared to 2.9 
kg for poultry or 1.0 kg for tofu. 
Even when compared to reducing 
the use of unsustainable food 
packaging, 
reducing 
meat 

consumption is more effective 
at lowering GHG emissions. One 
would have to avoid all food 
packaging for 11 years to reduce 
the same amount of CO2 as one 
year without meat. If everyone 
reduces their meat consumption 
by 25%, which is equivalent to 
avoiding meat about two days a 

week, it could lead to a reduction 
of 82 million metric tons of GHG 
emissions per year. Consciously 
choosing to avoid meat on specific 
days each week is a simple way 
individuals and families with the 
means to do so can address their 
own carbon footprint. In their 
emissions reduction plan, EGLE 
should include such practical 
measures that citizens can take 
on a day-to-day basis along 
with incentives and penalties to 
encourage compliance.

The 
timing 
of 
Whitmer’s 

executive directive also raises 
questions about the strength 
of the commitment. With the 
highly contested and polarized 
U.S. presidential election just a 
month away, it is conspicuous 
that the Democratic governors 
of several states released their 
plan to tackle climate change 
around the same time. California 
Gov. Gavin Newsom released an 
executive order on the same day 
as Michigan to end in-state sales 
of gasoline-powered automobiles 
by 2035. However, there are 
significant legislative barriers 
these states have to overcome 
in order to actually enact these 
plans, 
calling 
into 
question 

the efficacy of these orders. 
In Michigan, for example, the 
state legislature is controlled by 
the Republican Party, who will 
likely be unwilling to approve 
sweeping 
emission 
reduction 

plans during an election year, 
particularly 
given 
that 
the 

Republican-controlled 
U.S. 

federal government withdrew 
from 
the 
Paris 
Climate 

Agreement. 
Such 
legislative 

barriers, combined with the 
executive order’s striking lack 
of details, begs the question if 
this is merely a tactic to swing 
undecided voters. But regardless 
of the potential political motives 
behind 
the 
executive 
order, 

climate change is a timely issue 
and deserves action now. Even 
if Whitmer’s order was only 
meant as a publicity stunt, the 
state of Michigan should use 
the opportunity to fully address 
carbon emissions and create a 
plan for a clean energy future.

While the commitment to 

carbon neutrality by 2050 is 
encouraging in an era when the 
existence of climate change is 
not agreed upon in national 
politics, the quality of the 
eventual plan will vary wildly 
based on what it contains. A 
plan that contains real solutions 
for 
public 
transportation, 

renewable 
energy, 
corporate 

abuse and environmental racism 
will be effective — one that is 
vague on these issues will be a 
waste of time. Ultimately, we 
will not be able to pass judgment 
on the actual plan until it comes 
out at the end of next year. For 
now, we encourage individuals 
to look for personal ways to 
reduce carbon emissions to the 
best of each person’s ability 
and urge the EGLE to create a 
plan that will address the real 
threat climate change poses to 
humanity.

L

ast Wednesday, the cops 
who killed Breonna Taylor 
got away with murder. 

It’s not lost on me that the 

announcement that only one cop 
would be charged — with “wanton 
endangerment” for shooting into 
neighbors’ apartments and not 
Taylor herself — came out on 
the 65th anniversary of the day 
Emmett Till’s murderers were 
declared not guilty. I saw the posts 
on social media, with the photos 
of Till and Taylor held up together 
to remind Black Americans that 
nothing has changed. Sixty-five 
years and Black Americans still have 
our lives taken from us while our 
murderers live out theirs. In this 
country, Black lives don’t matter; 
not to the health care system and 
certainly not to policing bodies 
across the nation.

But certainly, Black deaths do. 
In the age of social media and 

the Internet at large, visuals of 
Black people both dead and dying 
seem to be readily available. A quick 
Google search of the video of George 
Floyd’s murder warrants upward 
of 8.3 million results, 8.3 million 
ways to watch a man die a horrific 
death over a “counterfeit” $20 bill. 
The worst part? Floyd isn’t the first 
Black victim of police brutality to 
have his final moments filmed and 
broadcasted for the world to see. 
One of the first instances of police 
brutality to ever be caught on camera 
caused enough outrage to spark the 
1992 Los Angeles Uprising, and the 
victim, Rodney King, survived.

The ones who would follow 

wouldn’t be so lucky. In 2014, 
we watched Eric Garner die in a 
chokehold on Staten Island, N.Y. 
Two years later, it was Alton Sterling 
being shot point-blank in Baton 
Rouge, La. and Philando Castile in 
St. Paul, Minn.

These 
videos 
are 
posted, 

reposted, retweeted and saved 

over and over; but why? Raising 
awareness and sparking outrage 
appear to be the biggest reasons. 
It’s necessary, some insist, to make 
sure this irrefutable proof of the 
violence of policing bodies is seen by 
as many people as possible. Without 
these videos, they cry, how will the 
world know of this horrible evil that 
has only plagued our country since 
the advent of the camera capable of 
recording film?

In their choice to utilize —and 

in some instances, capitalize off of 
— Black deaths to potentially raise 
awareness and spark outrage, well-
meaning social media activists are 
perpetuating the same violence 
against Black people that led to the 
gruesome events caught on tape 
with no reward. We have 30 years of 
visuals of Black deaths at the hands 
of the police, do we really need more 
of it?

Char Adams, a reporter who 

focuses on race, gender and identity 
issues, argues that we’ve gained 
nothing from all of this. These 
pictures and videos haven’t gotten 
us any closer to ending police 
brutality. Floyd was still suffocated 
to death despite the viral status of 
the Garner, Sterling and Castile 
videos. Jacob Blake was still shot 
by police in Kenosha, Wis., which 
is only a five-hour drive away from 
where Floyd was murdered three 
months before. The circulation of 
the Floyd video didn’t stop Kenosha 
police officers from shooting Blake 
in the back seven times.

So Black deaths, posted on 

Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and 
elsewhere, are not going to save 
us. To share or repost these videos, 
especially without warning, is to 
perpetuate the same anti-Black 
violence that is put on full display. 
It’s traumatizing especially for 
young Black Americans, who must 
watch someone who could be our 
brother/sister/mother/father/aunt/

uncle/cousin or even us suffer for the 
whole world to see. It’s traumatizing 
to see that white America can ignore 
decades of Black Americans’ dismal 
relationship with the police, only 
paying attention once our suffering 
is put on gruesome display. 

We have no videos of Taylor’s 

death and some could say the 
three officers of the Louisville 
Metropolitan Police Department 
won’t face charges for her death 
because we cannot see what 
Taylor did as they stormed into 
her 
apartment. 
What 
we 
do 

have, however, is the continued 
consumption 
of 
Black 
deaths. 

Taylor’s name became a war cry, 
demanding the immediate arrest of 
the officers who took her life. Now? 
It’s a meme, and not a single one of 
the three officers involved have 
been arrested for her death over six 
months later. 

Taylor was an emergency room 

technician and an aspiring nurse. 
She 
was 
someone’s 
daughter, 

someone’s cousin, someone’s best 
friend. Now she’s a quirky caption 
for Riverdale stars to use on their 
risqué Instagram posts and the 
name of a convention where she 
barely appears on the promotional 
flyer. All of it done in the name of 
raising awareness and provoking 
outrage for Taylor’s benefit, but 
Taylor is still dead and the three 
officers have only faced consequences 
for damaging plaster walls. 

Taylor, Floyd and countless other 

victims of police brutality are given 
T-shirts before they are given justice 
and that’s tiring. I’m tired of watching 
people who look like me, who could be 
me being killed with no repercussions 
for their killers. I’m tired of watching 
their deaths on loop just for nothing to 
happen. 

And for our sake, I hope you are, too.

FROM THE DAILY

MI Healthy Climate Plan lacks crucial details
O

n Sept. 23, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive order 
that intends to cut carbon emissions, create clean energy jobs and achieve 
carbon neutrality in Michigan by 2050. The order charges the Department 

of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy with the task of drafting a plan to 
achieve these goals, which would need to be submitted to the governor by Dec. 31, 
2021. While The Michigan Daily Editorial Board welcomes such a plan, the devil 
is ultimately in the details, and this order contains almost no details. We believe 
that an effective plan should clearly identify sources of emissions and clean energy 
alternatives, improve public transportation, have provisions to hold corporations 
accountable and address environmental racism prevalent in the state of Michigan.

S

ince the University of Michigan 
welcomed its students back 
to campus for the 2020 fall 

semester, many students have felt 
torn between risking exposure to 
COVID-19 and remaining isolated. 
Even when people make the choice 
to stay in, some still risk exposure 
if those they live with attend large 
indoor gatherings with no masks or 
distancing. The COVID-19 pandemic 
has complicated social pressures from 
friends, tensions with roommates and 
the natural desire to socialize. Amid 
these complications, Fraternity & 
Sorority Life’s life’s tight-knit, socially 
competitive community intensifies 
groupthink and places undue social 
pressure on members. 

In order to better understand the 

experience 
and 
decision-making 

of FSL members, I interviewed 
three members whose approaches 
to socialization vary greatly: one 
sorority member, whom I will call 
Rachel, who is not going to fraternity 
parties; one sorority member, whom 
I will call Julia, who is going to 
parties at different fraternities; and 
one fraternity member, whom I will 
call Zach, who is attending his own 
fraternity’s parties. 

All three FSL members told me that 

one of the greatest factors driving their 
social decisions is a fear of missing out. 
They said fellow members often talk 
about the parties and social events they 
attend, and not attending parties can 
make members feel they are missing 
out on important chapter bonding. 

“It seems like everyone I live with 

has accepted that getting COVID-19 

is inevitable and are just partying 

while 
they 
can,” 
Rachel 
said. 

“Everyone I talk to says that since 
other people in the house are, there is 
no point in not going. It’s hard because 
I feel like everyone is getting closer 
and making these memories together, 
but I have to remind myself that close, 
real friendships are rarely formed at 
parties.”

The members I interviewed seem 

to count the risk of catching COVID-
19 as analogous to other risks that 
young people take, like drinking or 
smoking. However, the disease’s high 
transmission rate means that if one 

person in a living community adopts 

the risk, they raise the risk factor for 
their entire community. Members 
of FSL who entered the school year 
planning on social distancing said 
they now feel burdened by the risk 
of COVID-19 exposure but without 
the upside of getting to socialize. 
However, this creates a dangerous 
feedback loop wherein people put 
themselves at risk based on the notion 

that they are missing out. They go 
out, making more people feel like 
the odd one out for not doing so, and 
then they contribute to the culture 
of partying with little regard for 
the greater implications on the 
University community. 

Julia, who regularly attends indoor 

parties at fraternities, explains that 
while she does not believe fraternities 
are safe to visit, her “frat guy friends 
are getting tested regularly and being 
super open and honest, so I feel safe 
in those specific situations.” 

Fraternity party attendees may 

feel relatively unconcerned about 
transmitting COVID-19, as testing 
and symptom checking provide a 
sense of security. However, there 
is still high inaccuracy in testing, 
especially the rapid testing that 
many in FSL are opting to take, and 
the average incubation period for an 
infected person with COVID-19 is 
4-5 days. This means that an infected 
individual 
could 
test 
negative, 

continue to socialize with multiple 
circles of friends and spread the 
disease.

Infected individuals are most 

contagious in the 24-48 hour period 
before they start showing symptoms. 
This means that frequent testing and 
symptom-checking are not effective 
measures for preventing an outbreak 
in indoor settings. According to 
those interviewed, many fraternities 
are currently holding under-the-
radar mixers with multiple different 
sororities weekly. It only takes one 
person at one party to spark the 
spread of COVID-19 into multiple 
houses in just one week.

Elle Jimenez, President of the 

University of Michigan’s Panhellenic 
Association, commented that “The 
Panhellenic and IFC Executive 
boards ... decided together that 
it would be in the best interest of 
our immediate Panhellenic and 
IFC communities, as well as the 
University of Michigan community, 
and the surrounding community 
of Ann Arbor to keep our social 
moratorium in place from March 

11, 2020,” and that “The Panhellenic 
Association at the University of 
Michigan 
actively 
discourages 

attending gatherings that violate the 
current Washtenaw County Health 
Department public health order.”

With a similar script-like tone, 

Ian Ross, President of the University 
of 
Michigan’s 
Interfraternity 

council, described multiple ways 
that Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) 
is attempting to remain in control of 
fraternity social events: “The social 
responsibility committee (SRC) is 
carrying out community checks 
on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday 
nights while remaining in vehicles 
and documenting and/or reporting 
and 
inappropriate 
gatherings 

... We have maintained a line of 
communication with the Ann Arbor 
Police Department and University 
of Michigan Police Department 
to discuss our goals for a public 
health informed semester, including 
effective reporting and enforcement 
strategies for off-campus facilities.”

While the Presidents of both 

IFC and Panhel claim to be actively 
enforcing compliance with public 
health guidelines in their chapters, 
the measures they are taking 
are ineffective with no serious 
consequences for members that 
choose to attend unsafe social 
gatherings. When questioned about 
possible underground mixers that 
may be occurring, Jimenez did not 
comment on the subject. Additionally, 
Ross, while acknowledging that 
attending these large gatherings is 
“unnecessary and harmful,” chose 
to note that it is “unfortunate 
that 
individuals, 
regardless 
of 

involvement in FSL organizations, 
chose to attend social gatherings 
that are not in alignment with public 
health guidance,” framing the issue as 
one that the larger U-M community is 
responsible for, not just IFC.

For Zach, there is no guilt or 

worry of contributing to the spread 
of the virus. He places much of the 
blame on the University for imposing 
unrealistic rules and regulations and 
on those who attempt to photograph 
and expose partiers. “Things have 
been pushed inside out of fear of mob 
retaliation here, which I understand, 
but it is not conducive to making 
things better. People are not going 
to stop partying. They will just do it 
more secretly, and therefore more 
dangerously,” Zach said.

W

hen Americans living 
on the West Coast 
woke up on Sept. 9, 

they were met with a concerning 
reality. From northern California 
all the way up through Oregon, 
the sky was an apocalyptic shade 
of reddish-orange. The western 
United States is once again 
engulfed in flames, as hundreds 
of wildfires have ravaged forests 
and disrupted the lives of millions 
throughout California, Oregon 
and Washington. While California 
generally has wildfires every year, 
this is no ordinary fire season. 

Five of the ten biggest fires 

in 
California’s 
history 
have 

happened this year, and thus 
far this fire season has claimed 
the lives of almost three dozen 
Americans, burnt millions of 
acres of forest and have displaced 
hundreds of thousands. Smoke 
from these fires has reached all the 
way to the East Coast and Europe, 
and thanks to the blazes, Portland 
recorded the world’s worst air 
quality earlier this month, forcing 
residents to remain inside. So why 
should Michiganders care about 
something so far away? Empathy 
aside, smoke from these fires 
affects our air quality, and while 
Michigan has not had large forest 
fires in its recent history, there 
have been massive fires before, 
and there likely will be again. 

Forest fires can start for 

numerous 
reasons, 
but 
the 

National Park Service estimates 
that 85% of forest fires are 
caused by humans. Specifically, 
human activities such as leaving 
campfires unattended, burning 
debris and arson are some of the 
most common causes of forest 
fires. 
These 
common 
causes 

have led many climate deniers, 
including 
President 
Trump 

himself, to claim that the record 
fires throughout the West are the 
result of bad forest management. 
In a recent press conference with 
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, 
California 
Natural 
Resources 

Secretary Wade Crowfoot and 
other 
environment 
and 
fire 

officials, 
Trump 
stated 
that 

“It’ll start getting cooler, you 

just watch” when confronted by 
Crowfoot over blaming vegetation 
management. 
After 
Crowfoot 

dryly commented that he wished 
the 
science 
agreed, 
Trump 

responded, saying “I don’t think 
science knows, actually.” This 
approach is incredibly dangerous, 
and will only contribute to even 
greater ecological destruction. 

The science behind wildfires 

is rather simple and is just a quick 
Google search away. According to 
the Center for Climate and Energy 
Solutions, fires are more likely 
to occur and grow bigger when 
there are higher air temperatures 
and drier soil conditions. Climate 
change contributes to both of 
these conditions by warming the 
earth and drying out the organic 
matter that burns, which has led 
to the number of large forest fires 
in the western United States to 
double between 1984 and 2015. The 
California state fire department 
recently added to their website 
that “warmer spring and summer 
temperatures, reduced snowpack, 
and 
earlier 
spring 
snowmelt 

create longer and more intense 
dry seasons that increase moisture 
stress on vegetation and make 
forests more susceptible to severe 
wildfire.” So yes, Mr. President, the 
science does know, actually.

Following the extremely hot and 

dry summer of 1871, forests burned 
throughout 
the 
Great 
Lakes 

region. Scientists believe that the 
fires in northeast Michigan were 
sparked by dry lightning strikes or 
even meteor showers. After the 
fires had ceased, it was estimated 
that 2,500 lives were tragically 
lost and just over 2 million 
acres of forests were destroyed. 
Michigan has suffered through 
catastrophic wildfires in the 
past and, unfortunately, climate 
models project that Michigan 
will continue to get warmer and 
drier. In 2000, Michigan had 
just over ten heatwave days per 
year. A heatwave day is when the 
temperature is higher than the 
historical average for that day and 
region. Just ten years from now, in 
2030, that number is projected to 
increase to 35. 

By 2050, summer droughts in 

Michigan are projected to triple, 
making the drought severity index 
greater than Texas’ current level. 
As temperatures increase and 
droughts become more frequent, 
Michigan becomes much more 
susceptible to forest fires similar 
to those currently devastating the 
western U.S. If something isn’t 
done to slow temperature rise, the 
California, Oregon and Washington 
fires could be just a preview of 
what the climate crisis will bring 
to Michigan and the rest of the 
Midwest. 

In a time where the planet is, quite 

literally, on fire, our elected leaders 
have failed us. While Republicans 
echo Trump’s talking points that 
the fires are due to poor forest 
management, Democrats rightly 
acknowledge that climate change is 
the leading cause of the destruction, 
but refuse to adequately meet the 
moment. The most egregious case 
of this is Newsom. He has recently 
taken to Twitter to declare that 
“climate change is REAL” while 
having approved 12 new permits for 
Chevron Corporation to continue 
hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in 
Kern County, Calif. — just north of 
Los Angeles County — bringing the 
total new fracking events to 360 for 
the year. Newsom can’t have it both 
ways. Acting in a manner that fails 
to account for science — the same 
science he claims to follow — is a 
form of climate denial. 

Staring down the monster of 

the climate crisis is something that 
many people — myself included as 
someone studying the environment 
— find incredibly intimidating. It 
can be hard to know where to start 
and often feels hopeless. Joining 
youth-led organizations such as 
Sunrise Movement or Climate 
Action Movement will bring you 
together with other like-minded 
young people who share a common 
goal. A better world is possible, we 
just have to fight for it.

J

ust more than six months 
have passed since the first 
two cases 
of COVID-19 

were confirmed in Michigan. The 
identification of these cases quickly 
prompted extreme yet necessary 
reactions, as the following day, 
University of Michigan President 
Mark Schlissel shut down the Ann 
Arbor campus and urged students 
to return home. Eleven days later, 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued her 
Stay Home, Stay Safe order, closing 
all services deemed nonessential and 
sending the state of Michigan into 
quarantine. 

Undeniably, all of our lives have 

undergone enormous changes since 
those first cases were identified 
— and these changes naturally 
induced additional stress. Our social 
interactions are fewer and further 
between, requiring masks and social 
distancing with most, if not all, 
people outside of our households. 
Most of our classes are online, with 
those that are in person requiring 
face masks and social distancing 

upon entering campus grounds. 

Students have been advised to 

avoid out-of-area travel throughout 
the semester, including trips to 
visit family. Even if we choose to 
disregard the latter, we still live with 
the constant anxiety of exposing 
vulnerable 
family 
members 
to 

the virus spreading rampantly on 
our campus. We now live with an 
overwhelming number of rules that, 
while meant to keep us safe, inhibit 
our ability to fulfill our needs as 
inherently social creatures. 

Exacerbating 
our 
stress 

arising from the pandemic and 
our 
extremely 
limited 
social 

interactions is the chaos emanating 
from all aspects of our world. The 
wildfires currently ravaging the 
West Coast, one of which has now 
burned more than 103,000 acres, 
becoming one of the largest fires 
in Los Angeles County history, in 
addition to the Creek fire which has 
burned 304,604 acres. The National 
Hurricane Center is, for the second 

time in history, starting to use Greek 
letters to label this year’s hurricanes 
because they exhausted their list of 
traditional names.

Furthermore, this summer was 

characterized by protests as much 
as it was by the pandemic, with a 
much needed anti-racism movement 
finally gaining popularity by virtue 
of the leaders of Black Lives Matter 
and spurred by recent incidents of 
police brutality. Closer to home, the 
fall semester welcomed strikes by the 
Graduate Employees’ Organization 
and the residential advisors of 
University 
Housing 
regarding 

university reopening plans and 
policing on campus. 

Throughout all of this turmoil, 

we, as students, are still trying to deal 
with the typical stresses of college 
life: maintaining our GPA, involving 
ourselves in student organizations, 
applying for jobs and internships 
and planning for our future after 
graduation. The immense weight of 
all of this, coupled with the chaos of 
the external world, is indisputably 
harmful to our mental health. 

Prior to the pandemic, one in 

five 
college 
students 
reported 

experiencing 
one 
or 
more 

diagnosable mental disorders; during 
the pandemic, the rate of depression 
among college students was found to 
have increased. This isn’t shocking, as 
so much is yet to be known about the 
pandemic and the coronavirus itself, 
making this an inherently anxiety-
inducing 
situation. 
Additionally, 

students are left to worry whether 
the quality of the education that they 
are paying so much for will remain 
the same when received over Zoom. 
Even more, graduating students are 
anxious about whether they will be 
able to find a job upon graduation. 

Now more than ever, it’s crucial 

that we take care of our mental 
health. Mental health issues are 
associated with twice the likelihood 
of dropping out of school entirely, and 
with all of the chaos that currently 
characterizes 
our 
campuses, 

headlines and news feeds, college 

students are bound to experience 
more mental struggles than they 
have in the past. Consequently, the 
coming months will see a surge 
of students seeking mental health 
services, potentially overwhelming 
the 
University’s 
Counseling 

and 
Psychological 
Services 
— 

which already faces the issue of 
understaffing, leading to long wait 
times for students in need. 

It’s important to note, however, 

that CAPS is still open to students 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
with both in-person and virtual 
options available. At the time of 
writing this column, the current 
wait time for the next available initial 
consultation is 15 business days. 
While this is a long time for those 
seeking mental health services, there 
are emergency resources available as 
well — and it’s still worth scheduling 
the initial consultation if it means that 
you will eventually end up receiving 
the help that you need. Outside 
of CAPS, the Wolverine Support 
Network, a student-led organization, 
offers virtual weekly groups meant 
to empower its members to support 
each other’s well-being. 

Still, though, the University must 

place more emphasis on recruiting 
counselors and specialists so that 
this wait time can be reduced. 
Until then, as we enter the colder 
months, which already tend to see 
increases in the number of people 
seeking mental health support, we 
must do what we can to take care of 
ourselves. Try to keep a consistent 
routine, talk about how you’re 
feeling with someone you trust 
and make a goal to do something 
for yourself each day, even if it’s 
something small. As always, be 
sure to check in with those that you 
care about — they’re probably going 
through something similar.

The psychedelic renaissance: discovery or 

appropriation?

Mental wellness deserves attention now 

more than ever

ELAYNA SWIFT | COLUMN

W

ith the Decriminalize 
Nature 
movement 

happening in Ann 

Arbor and other cities around 
the country and the birth of 
psychedelic research centers at 
major universities like Johns 
Hopkins and UC Berkeley, it 
seems as if the United States 
is entering a new wave — what 
some are calling the psychedelic 
renaissance.

While both new research 

and ancient wisdom continue 
to point to the healing potential 
of entheogenic medicines for 
mental and physical ailments, 
the question remains: To what 
extent are psychedelics just 
assimilation of old medicine? 
If we are to create a healthy 
and sustainable relationship 
with these substances in years 
to come, we must not turn a 
blind eye to their history, both 
dark and light. 

When colonization of the 

Americas began in 1492, so did 
the commodification of plants 
like tobacco, cacao and coca 
by moneyed interests. Once 
regarded and used as sacred 
medicines, these substances 
were at first feared, then 
eventually 
watered 
down, 

processed and commodified 
for European markets, losing 
their cultural and medicinal 
value in the process. While it 
may be true that cigarettes, 
chocolate 
and 
cocaine 

are addictive, it should be 
recognized that their plant 
derivatives, as they were used 

before colonization, were 

not.

As the tobacco, chocolate 

and cocaine trade have since 
blossomed into multibillion-
dollar 
industries, 
so 
have 

societal illnesses of addiction 
and incarceration; from the 
dire health consequences of 
cigarette use, to the chocolate 
industry’s reliance on child 
labor, to the drug war’s brutal 
impact 
on 
Colombia, 
the 

way in which U.S. citizens 
consume 
these 
substances 

today is both dangerous and 
counterproductive.

While the U.S.’s solution to 

addiction has largely been to 
enforce stricter drug laws, it 
is clear now that this policy 
is not only ineffective but also 
dangerous, costly and racist. 

Since the 1960s, politicians 

have argued that stricter drug 
laws are the solution. Yet 
a top adviser for the Nixon 
administration even admitted 
that the war on drugs began 
as a political tactic against 
antiwar leftists and Black 
people. Indeed, drug laws 
have 
been 
enforced 
more 

harshly for Black and Latinx 
communities than for white 
communities. Today, people 
of color, despite equal rates of 
use, are 13.4 times more likely 
to be imprisoned than white 
people due largely to current 
drug laws; additionally, the 
number of Black men in prison 
today (792,000) equals the 
number of enslaved men in 
1820. The war on drugs itself 
has even been referred to by 
the American Civil Liberties 
Union and others as “The New 
Jim Crow.” 

Despite its disproportionate 

and 
harmful 
impact 
on 

communities of color, the war 
on drugs has been a failure 
as far as addiction rates go. 
Of the nearly 21 million U.S. 
citizens living with at least 
one addiction today, 9 in 10 
will not receive treatment. 
Of the people who are able 
to afford and complete rehab 
programs, only about 30% will 
have success in treating their 
addiction. 

Given this low access and 

quality 
of 
treatment, 
U.S. 

citizens are being increasingly 
drawn outside of the country 
in search of other options. In 
the realm of psychedelics, one 
of the most notable options 
is Ibogaine therapy, which, 
though originally used as an 
ancient and sacred medicine 
in West Africa, has emerged 

as a glimmer of hope for 
its potentially risky, often 
unregulated, yet powerful use 
in treating serious addictions 
to 
substances 
like 
heroin 

and opium. On one hand, 
success stories boast of its 
compelling ability to address 
the root causes of addiction 
through a psychedelic journey 
inside 
one’s 
self. 
On 
the 

other, evidence is still largely 
anecdotal; a deeper look into 
success 
rates 
reveals 
that 

relapse still poses a challenge 
to long-term recovery. 

In this light, while our 

new cultural awareness of 
psychedelics may represent 
hope, our attitudes also point to 
a long history of colonization. 
Had the sacredness of these 
medicines 
been 
considered 

at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 

colonization era, perhaps the 
harmful 
commodification 

and addiction patterns we 
see today could have been 
avoided. Additionally, as we 
proceed with the new science 
of psychedelics, we must also 
recognize 
that 
these 
new 

discoveries are in many ways 
rediscoveries 
of 
traditional 

medicines and spiritual rites 
of 
passage 
for 
indigenous 

communities.

In the meantime, as we 

continue to explore potential 
treatments like Ibogaine for 
addiction, it is worth looking 
into a deeper understanding 
of 
how 
traditional 
use 

could improve not only the 
efficacy of treatment but also 
our relationships with the 
people who have used these 
medicines for thousands of 
years. 

As we move forward, we 

should keep in mind that if we 
do not acknowledge our past 
and act differently, we may 
only be bandaging wounds 
that 
require 
much 
deeper 

healing.

n the wake of Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg’s passing 
last week, the national 

discussion has pivoted from 
the pandemic to the Supreme 
Court, and the moves Senate 
Republicans 
and 
President 

Donald Trump are making to fill 
the vacancy on the high court. 
Democrats are absolutely correct 
in calling out Senate Majority 
Leader 
Mitch 
McConnell, 

R-Ky., for reversing his position 
from 2016, and Republicans are 
absolutely correct arguing that 
filling the Court’s vacancy is 
the constitutional obligation of 
the president and the Senate. 
However, 
while 
these 
two 

positions 
occupy 
the 
vast 

majority of headlines, the most 
vital lesson to be learned is that of 
prudence, of restraint and of the 
harm of nearsightedness.

Yet before launching into the 

present day, it is important to 
consult the annals of history. 
Article III of the Constitution 
establishes the judicial branch 
of the federal government to 
consist of “one supreme Court, 
and in such inferior Courts as the 
Congress may from time to time 
ordain and establish.” Critically, 
the 
Constitution 
does 
not 

mandate a set number of justices 
to preside over the Court.

The first Congress passed 

the Judiciary Act of 1789, which 
established the federal judiciary 
and set forth specific rules for the 
Court. Notably, it declared that 
“the supreme court of the United 
States shall consist of a chief 
justice and five associate justices, 
any four of whom shall be a 
quorum.” Only after the Judiciary 
Act of 1869 did the Court adopt 
the current distribution of judges 
–– one chief justice and eight 
associate justices.

While the Supreme Court 

is the least political branch of 
the government, both in theory 
and in practice, it certainly has 
not remained impervious to 

influence. In the 1930s, amid the 
Great Depression and President 
Franklin 
Roosevelt’s 
New 

Deal, the Court faced a difficult 
position. After rulings against 
the constitutionality of various 
sections of F.D.R.’s New Deal, the 
President proposed the Judicial 
Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, 
more famously known as “the 
court-packing plan.”

The 
bill 
ultimately 
did 

not succeed, thanks to then-
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee 

chairman Henry F. Ashurst, 
but it introduced the possibility 
that the executive might forgo 
prudence and enact sweeping 
changes to the most stable branch 
of government. No president 
since has attempted such a 
radical move, but recent moves 
by the Senate have dramatically 
destabilized, and subsequently 
politicized, 
the 
appointment 

process for judges and justices. 

In 
2013, 
during 
former 

President 
Obama’s 
second 

term, Senate Majority Leader 
Harry Reid, D-Nev., enacted 
something many labeled “the 
nuclear option.” Under Reid, the 
Democratic 
Senate 
approved 

changes to the rules in which the 
Senate, as an institution, dealt 
with judicial nominations. These 
changes prohibited the filibuster 
from being deployed as a means 
to delay confirmations, as well 
as reducing the number of votes 
needed to confirm a judicial 
nomination from a supermajority 
to simple majority –– from 60 
votes, down to 51.

However, this rule change 

did not affect Supreme Court 
nominations, 
only 
cabinet 

posts and federal judgeships. 
That alteration to the rules 
came in 2017, after Republicans 
had successfully halted Judge 
Merrick Garland’s nomination, 
taken back the White House and 
a Senate majority.

Current 
Senate 
Majority 

Leader McConnell deployed the 

nuclear option to remove the 
supermajority requirement for 
Supreme 
Court 
nominations, 

successfully appointing Justice 
Neil Gorsuch to the bench. By 
virtue of timing, Justice Brett 
Kavanaugh was confirmed under 
the same rules, and now we 
arrive at the predicament today.

Nearsightedness 
and 
the 

temptation to tip the scales 
in favor of current partisan 
objectives 
has 
run 
rampant 

through the Senate in the last 
decade. 
The 
nuclear 
option, 

so-called 
for 
its 
previously 

unthinkable ramifications, has 
been enacted twice in the last 
seven years, resulting in countless 
judgeship 
confirmations 
as 

well as two Supreme Court 
confirmations. Such destabilizing 
actions 
would’ve 
been 

inconceivable a half-century ago. 
Yet now, we may be on the verge 
of again neglecting history’s 
valuable lesson. 

Both 
the 
president 
and 

the 
Senate 
are 
fulfilling 

their constitutional duties in 
nominating Judge Amy Coney 
Barret –– on this point, there 
is no debate, “Biden rule” or 
otherwise. However, consider the 
present situation had Democrats 
not unleashed the nuclear option 
in 2013, and Republicans not 
extended it in 2017. Judge Barret 
would be nominated, yet since 
the Republicans do not have a 
super-majority –– and very few, if 
any, Democratic senators would 
be in favor –– Barret would not 
be confirmed. Problem solved for 
the left.

Ultimately, this results in a 

painfully 
obvious 
conclusion: 

Rash changes to the fundamental 
operating procedures of the 
Senate, in pursuit of short-term 
partisan goals, greatly endanger 
the stability of our institutions. 
To assume Democrats expected 
they’d be the only party 
to reap the benefits of their rule 
changes is hysterically foolish. 

However, to expect the same 
naivety from Republicans, this 
time regarding Supreme Court 
nominations, is similarly absurd. 

I am confident, however, that 

the Senate will right the ship. I 
believe the Senate rules will be 
changed back in the interest of 
stability, though under which 
party’s leadership I don’t know. 
There remains, however, the 
possibility of a future rife with 
instability beyond the Senate, 
which would be guaranteed if 
the Democrats, upon sweeping 
in November, look to F.D.R. for 
inspiration. 

Senate 
Minority 
Leader 

Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said 
recently that “nothing is off the 
table” if the GOP fills Justice 
Ginsburg’s seat. The allusion 
to court packing is clear as 
day, though its ramifications 
have apparently gone out the 
window. Understand, the tumult 
resulting 
from 
the 
nuclear 

option’s evocations resides solely 
in the process for nominating 
and 
confirming 
judges 
and 

justices. It would be appallingly 
naive to fundamentally alter 
the constitution of the Supreme 
Court to directly benefit short-
term political ambitions. 

The Supreme Court should 

embody 
stability. 
Set 
apart 

from the political tidings of 
the legislative branch and the 
campaigning of the executive 
branch, 
the 
judicial 
branch 

ensures the rights of the citizenry 
persist. Inscribed in the stone 
facade of our own University’s 
law school is the phrase, “The 
Supreme Court: Preserver of 
the Constitution; Guardian of 
our Liberties; Greatest of all 
Tribunals.” 
For 
our 
current 

leaders 
to 
presume 
such 

superior motives as to justify the 
modification of the judiciary’s 
fundamental 
rules 
is

T

his is not about religion. 
This is about oppression.

On Oct. 11, 2019, the 

crowd gave a standing ovation 
for 
their 
famous 
— 
some 

might say infamous — guest 
from 
Washington, 
D.C. 
The 

mostly Catholic law students 
of Notre Dame sat back down 
as Attorney General Bill Barr 
began by thanking his hosts. 
However, his actual speech was 
anything but gracious. For the 
next half hour, Barr — sounding 
more like a Fox News host 
caught in the breakroom on a 
hot mic than the leader of the 
Department of Justice — painted 
a fundamentally inaccurate and 
detached portrait of this country. 
The attorney general raved about 
the “steady erosion 
of our traditional 
Judeo-Christian 
moral 
system,” 

which he claimed 
was under siege by 
militant secularists 
on 
a 
“campaign 

to 
destroy 
the 

traditional 
moral 

order.” He cited 
examples of our 
“moral upheaval” 
ranging from the 
rise of illegitimate 
births to record 
levels of mental 
illness to the opioid 
epidemic. 

Now it’s easy to 

dismiss these comments as the 
views of one singular right-wing 
nut, but dismissing Barr’s beliefs 
out-of-hand 
allows 
speeches 

such as that one to go ignored, all 
while the Republican Party has 
undergone a seismic shift that 
now imperils the country. 

Before we go any further, let 

me make this crystal clear. As a 
practicing Catholic myself, I have 
no issues with religion or the 
Church. I have an issue with the 
false grievance politics present in 
modern conservatism, which are 
poised to drive the installation of 
an unqualified religious zealot on 
the Supreme Court, despite there 
being plenty of more qualified and 
equally, if not more, conservative 
judges on appeals courts across 
the country. This is not about 
religion or conservative ideals, 
this is about the Republican 
Party’s strategy of characterizing 
white Christians as oppressed 
and preying on the group’s fear 
of being replaced in order to win 
elections, erode our democratic 
institutions and retain power, 
despite representing a slowly 
shrinking 
minority 
of 
the 

population.

Amy Coney Barrett was born 

in 1972 in New Orleans, La. 
The eldest daughter of a lawyer 
for the Shell Oil Corporation, 
Barrett grew up comfortably 
before obtaining a B.A. from 
Rhodes College and a J.D. from 
Notre Dame Law School. From 
there, she went to clerk for a 
circuit court judge from 1997 to 
1998 and “Bong Hits 4 Jesus” 
opponent Antonin Scalia from 
1998 to 1999. Then, following a 
brief stint in private practice, 
Barrett settled in law school in 
2002, developing a breadth of 
controversial scholarship.

After 
Barrett, 
a 
lifelong 

member 
of 
the 
conservative 

Federalist 
Society, 
was 

nominated by Donald Trump to 
sit on the Seventh Circuit Court 
of 
Appeals, 
this 
scholarship 

formed the basis of several 
legitimate claims opposing her 
nomination. These claims were 
specifically amplified through 
a contentious exchange with 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., 
which instantly made Barrett a 
conservative media sensation.

When questioned about one 

of her own law review articles, 
which 
argued 
that 
Catholic 

judges should recuse themselves 
in cases regarding the death 
penalty, Barrett claimed that 
her views had evolved. The 
two sparred for a couple more 
minutes as Feinstein probed 
further into Barrett’s religious 
beliefs, 
and 
the 
exchange 

ended with Feinstein saying, 
“the dogma lives loudly within 
you, and that’s of concern.” 
The statement — a de facto 
insinuation that one cannot be 
both a Catholic and an impartial 
judge — incensed right-wing 
media, going viral on Twitter 

and being plastered across Fox 
News and other conservative 
outlets. However, this outrage 
was completely manufactured 
and, at its core, untruthful. 

Feinstein, who, herself, went 

to Catholic school, has voted to 
confirm hundreds of Catholic 
judges to the courts and had 
never shown an anti-Catholic 
bias in her five terms before then. 
Similarly, Catholic Sen. Dick 
Durbin, D-Ill., questioned Barrett 
during her confirmation about her 
self-identification as an “orthodox 
Catholic,” identifying as Catholic 
himself. However, those comments 
received next to no coverage by 
conservative outlets. Why? Well, 
simply put, that question from a 
fellow Catholic does not fit with 

the narrative that 
those 
networks 

and the party they 
support would like 
to portray. 

Fox and other 

conservative 
media 
outlets 

wanted to portray 
the hearing as the 
powerful, 
scary, 

elderly 
Jewish 

senator attacking 
the young Catholic 
judge because of 
religious 
hatred, 

despite 
this 

narrative clashing 
violently 
with 

reality. 
However, 

the conservative audience, which 
loves to see themselves as victims, 
did not examine the coverage 
closely, instead succumbing to 
confirmation bias and rallying 
around Barrett. This popularity 
made Barrett the apple of Trump’s 
eye, and, on Sept. 26, Scalia’s 
golden child — despite having next 
to no experience in the judiciary 
and next to no belief in voting 
rights — was announced to replace 
the notorious RBG.

Normally, in the profile of a 

political figure, this is when 
I would talk about Barrett’s 
draconian judicial philosophy 
— which we should all examine 
more closely — or maybe poke 
fun of her Karen-esque persona, 
but that’s not really the point. 
The point of this article is much 
larger than just Barrett. It is 
about the system that put her 
in a position of power. It is not 
the Federalist Society or her 
clerkship with Scalia. It is not her 
short stint in the federal judiciary 
or her conservative credentials 
as a judge. It is about the false 
grievances of the few white 
Christians who feel threatened 
by the societal advancements 
made by minorities and other 
“untraditional” groups. Sadly, 
these increasingly disconnected 
people have corrupted the ranks 
of the Trump administration 
from top to bottom.

The current vice president 

is a far-right conservative who 
supports conversion therapy and 
opposes “Mulan.” The secretary 
of state is a climate change denier 
who believes that Trump was 
sent by God to save the Jews from 
“the Iranian menace.” Even the 
Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention director — a scientist 
— doubts the efficacy of condoms 
in slowing the spread of AIDS. 
These radicals have led executive 
agencies to embrace conspiracy 
theories, reject science and wage 
a protracted war against the 
progress 
marginalized 
groups 

have made in this country over 
the last 50 years in order to benefit 
the racist, nativist and white 
supremacist portion of their base. 
Next time Trump emboldens the 
Proud Boys, remember the people 
surrounding him.

This administration is the result 

of a decades-long concerted effort 
by conservatives to transform the 
federal judiciary and degrade our 
democratic institutions through 
constant attacks on voting rights. 
The crowning achievement of this 
movement will be in front of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee on 
Oct. 12, and likely on the Supreme 
Court by Nov. 3. Though she 
did not earn this seat, much like 
her counterpart Justice Brett 
Kavanaugh, conservatives think 
she’s entitled to it. Now, we all 
must ask ourselves what she 
would be willing to do to keep it.

someone at all, Cancer, given their 
odd behavior. Give everyone the 

benefit of the doubt. There’s 

method in their madness.

TAURUS

Unexpected news from your partner

You’re changing your mind so often 
this week that you’re struggling to 
keep up with yourself. This intellectual 
instability is a good thing though, 
Virgo, in as much as it shows that you 

are keeping an open mind. 

Don’t be afraid to revisit 
old opinions.

Someone forgives you out of the blue 
– but do you forgive yourself? The

existing relationship or looking for 

new love. If you’re single, a 

friendship may turn into 

something much more.

A happy accident or fortunate 
coincidence works in your favor, 
Sagittarius, but you’re reminded that 
you could create more of your own 
luck if you were better organized. 

Work on clearing your 

clutter so that you can 

spend more time 
manifesting your 
dreams.

Fun is very much a team effort this 
week, so say yes to invitations and 
don’t be afraid to join in. If a travel 
opportunity presents itself, Capricorn, 
you’ll be busy weighing up the pros 

and cons – but don’t take so 

long that you miss out on 

an incredible chance.

Chaos at work subsides into 
something more doable and normal, 
but there’s still a lot of hard work to be 
done. Fortunately, Aquarius, your 
loved ones are very understanding 
and will back your need to spend 

more time on your career. 
Don’t lose your focus.

News travels fast, Pisces, but double 
check your facts before you spread 
gossip which may or may not be true. 
There’s an air of excitement as you 
wait for an announcement – and it 
should hopefully be good news. 

Changing circumstances 
benefit you hugely.

Icons: A love letter to River Phoenix Twitter stans 

and superfans

The world has a thing for 

martyrs. People treat it like a rite 
of passage if you make it into the 
27 Club with Jimi Hendrix and 
Kurt Cobain. But River Phoenix 
never even got to see his 27th 
year.

Phoenix died from a drug 

overdose on Halloween when he 
was only 23. His death was, and 
remains to be, so sensationalized 
that you can even watch the 
guys at Buzzfeed Unsolved try 
to contact his ghost. National 
news stations aired the 911 
call that his brother Joaquin 
Phoenix (“Joker,” “Her”) made 
from the Viper Room, the club 
owned by Johnny Depp (“Pirates 
of the Caribbean,” “Edward 
Scissorhands”) where River had 
collapsed. Long before social 
media, River’s life and death 
were treated like a sideshow 
attraction between commercials.

River was a reluctant icon. 

He hated his own celebrity 
(and the idea of celebrity at all), 
but he used it as a platform for 
his activism that could only be 

compared to the likes of Jane 
Fonda 
(“Klute,” 
“Grace 
and 

Frankie”) or Marlon Brando 
(“Streetcar Named Desire,” “The 
Godfather”). He spoke openly 
and passionately about animal 
rights and environmentalism 
in a time before there was a 
vegan option on every menu. 
Maybe he knew that PETA 
booked him because of his name 
as the precocious 17-year-old 
nominated for an Oscar, but he 
swallowed his pride because it 
was what he believed in.

Humility isn’t always included 

in definitions of masculinity. 
River could have performed 
the 
hypermasculinity 
of 

contemporary stars like Arnold 
Schwarzenneger, 
Sylvester 

Stallone, Patrick Swayze or Tom 
Cruise, but he didn’t. This isn’t 
to say that he wasn’t masculine; 
he could play a young Harrison 
Ford in “Indiana Jones and 
the Last Crusade” with all 
the heroism we knew from 
the action star, but with this 
added fragility that’s difficult 
to achieve in a short, ten-
minute cameo. River brought an 
intense, overwhelming amount 

of 
vulnerability 
that 
would 

underscore, rather than negate, 
his strength in each and every 
one of his roles. He made male 
tenderness iconic.

“Stand by Me,” based on 

the Stephen King novella “The 
Body,” is meant to be an ensemble 
film, but River’s performance as 
a tough but well-meaning kid 
from a dysfunctional family lit 
him up on everyone’s radar. The 
story started the “You wanna see 
a dead body?” trope as a group of 
middle school boys search for a 
local boy’s corpse in 1959. River 
may not be what most people 
remember most about the movie; 
it’s more recognizable as a clear 
influence of friendship-centered 
adventures like “The Sandlot” 
or “Stranger Things,” and as 
a parallel to other adjacent 
films like “The Goonies” or (of 
course, because of its source 
material) “IT.” Director Rob 
Reiner 
(“When 
Harry 
Met 

Sally”) captures the playfulness 
and devastation of childhood 
through the image of some boys 
walking down railroad tracks 
together with the dramatic irony 
of their knowledge that it was a 

train that killed the boy they’re 
looking for. 

At its core, “Stand by Me” is 

about love. And while the other 
cast members did an amazing 
job, there’s just nothing that you 
can compare to River’s delivery 
of the line: “I just wish I could go 
someplace where nobody knows 
me.” He admitted to using fake 
tears in the scene (he was only 
15 years old and it was his first 
major role in a feature film), but 
you believe it when he says it. 
Maybe it’s that boyishness that 
had everyone magnetized to 
the screen. He was a kid in 1986 
pretending he was in 1959, and 
you wonder if he was thinking of 
himself as his father, if this spoke 
to that feeling when you first 
see your father cry, when death 
stares you in the face, when, for 
the first time, you really, truly 
understand empathy.

I can’t help but wonder if 

“Stand by Me” was River’s way 
of reckoning with his childhood 
in the same way it is for everyone 
who watches the film.

THE B-SIDE: ICONS
Icons: It’s Dolly Parton’s world

If you asked any American to 

draw a picture of Dolly Parton, 
they’d probably scribble the same 
thing down. Big lipsticked smile, 
big blonde hair, big gaudy heels 
and, of course, her iconic big 
boobs. She is the image of camp in 
a way that only someone with her 
sass, confidence and incredible 
charisma could pull off, much less 
trademark in the way she has. She 
may have made her mark on the 
music industry with a song called 
“Dumb Blonde,” but Parton is 
nowhere near it. 

She knows what she’s doing 

at every moment — building her 
legacy step by step with a vigor 
which mirrors that of competitive 
cheerleaders 
and 
pageant 

Pomeranians. In Dolly’s words, “It 
takes a lot of money to look this 
cheap.” Her sparkling individuality 
(and rhinestones) may have set 
Parton out at the beginning of her 

career, but it is what has kept her on 
the map as times have changed.

The enduring image that Parton 

has created over her long career has 
permeated every era, surprisingly 
even this one, as her star rises 
with those who grew up listening 
to her and those who follow her 
on Twitter alike. For someone 
so brash and unapologetic, it 
is impressive that Parton has 
maintained this universal appeal 
throughout the years, especially 
given the polarizing nature of 
celebrity today. 

She’s a classic American icon 

with an even more American story: 
from the one-room cabin she was 
born in to a multimillion-dollar 
empire including theme parks and 
cookware, she’s the poster child for 
working your way up, no matter 
the obstacles. Everyone loves Dolly, 
and if her track record means 
anything, they will continue to love 
her forever. 

On the heels of her recent 

holiday release, A Holly Dolly 

Christmas, Parton has been on 
a lot of minds lately. It’s the first 
Christmas album she’s recorded 
in 30 years and reminds us of the 
overwhelming warmth that her 
clear, beautiful voice brings to 
listeners. The songwriter began 
her career as country musician 
Porter Wagoner’s “girl singer” 
on his variety show, developing a 
working relationship that lasted 
decades, but soon found her own 
path and eventually split to build 
her career as a solo artist. In fact, 
Parton wrote “I Will Always Love 
You” after leaving Wagoner’s side, 
reportedly during the same session 
that “Jolene” was also thought up. 

Parton shows up like this 

constantly in the history of country 
and pop music, permeating the 
industry with her charm and sass, 
no matter the occasion. She has 
hundreds of compositions that 
bring in millions of dollars a year, a 
theme park called Dollywood in the 
Smoky Mountains for family fun 
and classic Southern hospitality, 

a spa, a deal for personalized 
greeting cards with American 
Greetings and, soon, a cookware 
and home decor line with Williams 
Sonoma. 
The 
woman 
does 

everything, and her personality has 
eclipsed her music in some ways, 
despite its legacy and importance 
in the development of American 
country. Her singing voice may 
have established Parton in the 
public eye, but now her speaking 
voice is what keeps her there. Dolly 
Parton is a person, sure, but she is 
also an image, a feeling and a brand.

These business ventures and 

Parton’s hold on the public sphere 
have spurred somewhat of a Dolly 
renaissance in the past few years, 
even as the singer hit 74. For an 
older woman to keep that kind of 
relevance in the increasingly sexist 
and ageist world of celebrity is quite 
a feat, and her popularity doesn’t 
seem to be waning anytime soon.

For The Daily

Daily Arts Writer

DYLAN YONO
Daily Arts Writer

Growing up, one of my favorite 

songs of all time was Eminem’s 
hip-hop classic “Stan,” which tells 
a twisted tale from the perspective 
of a genuine superfan (or perhaps 
“stalker-fan”). Stan as depicted 
in the song is not the kind of fan 
anyone would want to identify 
with — he doesn’t get a happy 
ending.

It came as a surprise to me 

when I started high school and 
saw the word “stan” had entered 
the lexicon of celebrity fandoms. 
Stanning is a level of devotion to an 
artist beyond that of your everyday 
fan. It’s not quite the devotion of 
the term’s namesake; most stans 
firmly disapprove of stalker-like 
behavior. So what does it mean to 
be a stan?

“It’s kind of unhealthy to be 

honest,” Engineering sophomore 
Sophia Do said between laughs. 
“It’s a bit of an obsession.”

To stan means to love and 

support an artist in everything 
they do. It can take the form of 
supporting their music doing well 
on the charts, or feeling happy 
when they see their favorite 
artist do anything, down to the 
most innocuous activities. Stan 
communities exist for virtually 
every popular artist, and they even 
have their own demonyms. Justin 
Bieber stans are Beliebers, Taylor 
Swift stans are Swifties, Harry 
Styles stans are Stylers and BTS 
stans are ARMYs, just to name a 
few.

Do, a K-pop fan, stans artists like 

BTS, Red Velvet and BLACKPINK. 
K-pop fans in particular have a 
reputation among other fandoms; 
they’re 
widely 
perceived 
as 

some of the most devoted stans. 
According to Do, it’s a consequence 
of the Korean idol industry tightly 
controlling their artists’ images. 
“Idols have a persona they put on,” 
she explained. “It’s not actually 
them. Which makes people more 
curious.” The limited genuine 
interaction that K-pop idols can 
have with their fans gives them an 
air of mystery, and it bolsters their 
stans’ enthusiasm.

Where K-pop stans revel in 

every glimpse of their idols, if 
you’re a Justin Bieber stan, he 
might just Cash App you.

“The Biebs follows me on 

Twitter,” 
Engineering 
senior 

Isha Mishra said. “That was 
exciting. I remember I cried when 
it happened.” To promote the 
release of his latest single, “Holy,” 
Bieber partnered with Cash App 
to give away 250 thousand dollars. 
Mishra tweeted her Cash App, 
and Bieber sent her 500 dollars. “I 
was over the moon. I was crying, 
crying, crying.”

Mishra is a part of Stan Twitter, 

a subgenre of Twitter in which 
stans connect to talk about their 
favorite celebrities. They’ll share 
their favorite celebrity’s pictures, 
talk about their music and stay 
up to date with what their icons 
are doing, often on a day-to-day 
basis. It’s a boiling pot of tweets 
ranging from fiery hot takes and 
firm opinions to impassioned 
celebrity adoration. Much of the 
dialog is between people who 
don’t know each other in real 
life, but connect online over their 
common stanhood. It contrasts 
with “local Twitter,” stanglish 
(stan slang) for “normie Twitter” 
where users follow their real-life 
acquaintances (locals).

For Mishra, Stan Twitter is 

a home, a place to escape to. “It 
gives me a sense of community,” 
she said. “I tell them my everyday 
life, any time I have a problem 
or something, they’re one of the 
first people I’ll go to.” Even if she 
only gets to see her friends from 
Stan Twitter at concerts, their 
friendship is genuine. “I love them 
so much. We send each other 
things for our birthdays. We talk 
all the time. I just consider them 
my friends, not just like, ‘oh, I met 
them on the internet.’”

Harry Styles stan and Nursing 

freshman 
Delanie 
Schreiber 

echoed Mishra’s fondness for 
Stan Twitter. “It’s nice to be in 
a community of people who feel 
the same way that you do and are 
excited about the same thing,” 
Schreiber 
said. 
Like 
Mishra, 

Schreiber has also made long-time 
friends on Stan Twitter only to 

meet them years later at concerts.

Making friends and finding a 

community is as big a part of stan 
culture as the idols themselves. 
For many, friendship with other 
stans naturally goes deeper than 
a shared interest. “Harry Styles 
isn’t just music, you stan for Black 
Lives Matter, you support gay 
rights, because so does Harry 
Styles,” Schreiber explained. “If 
somebody supports an artist that 
supports those, you know that you 
have the same views and interests 
on things.”

Even though most of these 

artists are hugely popular, for a long 
time, being a stan was sort of like a 
niche hobby. Stan communities on 
Twitter or other social media help 
bring like-minded people together, 
but finding that space in real life 
can be tricky.

Do always felt some judgment 

from her peers for listening to 
K-pop. But today, K-pop is at the 
forefront of mainstream — BTS’s 
“Dynamite” is sitting comfortably 
at the top of the Billboard Hot 
100. When she first came to the 
University her freshman year, Do 
joined a K-pop dance group on 
campus with her roommate. She 
didn’t end up sticking with it, but 
her roommate did and made lots of 
friends through it.

There are numerous K-pop 

dance groups on campus, and 
though not every person in a dance 
group is necessarily a devout stan, 
it’s still a great way to find people 
who appreciate the same artists. 
For stans of Western artists, 
finding other stans doesn’t even 
need a dedicated space for it: Stans 
are everywhere.

Even in her first month on a 

mostly virtual campus, Schreiber 
has already met other Harry Styles 
fans. “I’ll meet people that I won’t 
know that they’re a Harry styles 
fan, and then they’ll mention a 
little thing,” she said. “And I’m like, 
‘Oh? Are you a Harry Styles fan?’ 
and we just click.” Recently she 
connected with another Nursing 
major who recognized her Harry 
Styles t-shirt. Amid all the usual 
freshman year small talk — the 
tiresome monotony of who-are-
you, where-are-you-from, what’s-
your-major — finding someone 
with a shared interest was a 
breath of fresh air for Schreiber. 
“You’re immediately in a different 
conversation, it’s not awkward, 
you have something to talk about,” 
she said.

Stan culture and the stan 

community is a place of comfort 
for many. Still, like any large 
community, it’s not without its 
problems.

LSA 
freshman 
Pranav 

Balachander stans artists like Dua 
Lipa and Taylor Swift, but he’s 
hesitant to call himself a stan. “I 
don’t necessarily engage in the 
typical stan culture behavior that 
you see on Twitter, but I am a stan 
of these artists,” he explained. 

Though they find solidarity in 

their respective stan communities, 
all 
of 
my 
interviewees 

acknowledged the capacity of 
stan culture to be toxic, both for 
the stans and the celebrities they 
follow. Balachander has seen that 
toxicity play out on Twitter in 
many forms.

One of the biggest provocateurs 

of conflict and competition among 
stans is actually the Billboard 
Hot 100. “Stan culture almost 
unilaterally focuses on charts 
without looking at the bigger 
picture,” Balachander said. Charts 
like the Hot 100 or Billboard 
200 rank singles and albums by 
somewhat 
objective 
measures 

of record sales and streaming 
numbers. When artists don’t do 
well on these charts, “they’re 
automatically branded as flops,” 
he said. (When they do rank 
highly, they’re “smashes.”)

For stans, it’s natural to want 

to see your artist do well. “The 
whole fanbase kind of rejoices at 
their success,” Do said. “And then 
you feel like it’s a big community 
and connected to all these people.” 
But by the nature of the charts, for 
one artist to be at the top means 
displacing another. And if an artist 
doesn’t chart, or their rankings 
slip, then competing stans are 
quick to call them a flop.

THE B-SIDE: ICONS
Taylor Swift runs music

I was seven years old when 

“You Belong With Me” came 
out, and it still gives me an 
indescribable rush of sheer 
happiness. It’s the song I play 
in the car with the windows 
down, letting everyone else 
on the road share my joy. It’s 
the song that I dance around 
to in my pajamas, feeling like 
I’m at a concert. Every time I 
hear it, I have to stop what I’m 
doing to give it the devotion it 
deserves.

That’s how I feel with every 

Taylor Swift song. That’s how 
so many people feel with every 
Taylor Swift song. 

Barbara Walters once said 

“Taylor Swift is the music 
industry.” She said this in 
2014, after Taylor’s record-
breaking 
album 
1989 
was 

released. 
Six 
years 
later, 

Taylor Swift is still the music 
industry. She’s released eight 
albums since the beginning of 
her career, and they’ve nearly 
all broken records. From her 
self-titled debut album to her 
most recent, surprise release 
folklore, she has never let the 
world down. 

It’s a shame, though, because 

the world has let her down on 
more than one occasion. From 
accusing her of writing only 
about her ex-boyfriends to 
the #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty 
to losing her master license 
over her recordings to having 
beauty standards forced on her 
that led to an eating disorder, 
the world has let her down 
because the world wants to 
hate Taylor Swift.

What makes her amazing, 

though, what makes her a true 
icon, is that she rises above 
it all. She forgives, but never 
forgets. She proves the world 
wrong. When the world said 
that she relies on the talent of 
others to write her own songs, 
she released self-written Speak 
Now (my absolute favorite 
album of all time). When the 
world said she was “just” a 
country artist, she released 
1989, for which she became the 

first female artist to win the 
Grammy’s Album of the Year 
award twice. When the world 
turned on her and called her 
a snake, she embraced it and 
released reputation. When the 
world said that she could only 
ever be a cookie-cutter pop 
star, she released the indie 
folk album folklore, which has 
led her to surpass Whitney 
Houston’s record for most 
weeks at number one on the 
Billboard 200 charts. Taylor 
Swift sits among the most 
revered stars. 

She refuses to let herself 

be torn down by haters or the 
media. As she herself said 
during the 1989 World Tour 
before her performance of 
her song “Clean,” “you are 
not the opinion of somebody 
who doesn’t know you or care 
about you.” And she’s not. The 
number of haters Taylor Swift 
has is the same number of 
people who refuse to give her 
a chance. They see a talented, 
young female star and refuse 
to give her any of the credit 
she is due. 

The people that do love her 

— her fans, her Swifties — have 
never just sat by and let the 
world tear her down. And in 
return, she loves them. Taylor 
Swift invites her fans to her 
house and plays them songs 
before an album’s release. She 
bakes them cookies, sends 
them Christmas gifts, shares 
inside jokes on Tumblr. How 
many artists do that? How 
many artists let their fans into 
their homes, into their hearts, 
the way she does? 

At the core of her being, 

Taylor Swift is an artist. Her 
songs, her words are, for lack 

of a better word, iconic. So 
many people have proposed to 
their significant others while 
“Love Story” was playing. So 
many people’s 2014 and 2015 
Instagram bios read “darling 
I’m a nightmare dressed like 
a daydream.” Everyone knows 
that when you turn 22, it’s 
your “Taylor Swift Birthday.” 
So many people declared 2020 
saved when folklore came out. 

She has proven time and 

time again that she doesn’t 
need 
the 
flashy 
concerts, 

gorgeous 
music 
videos 
or 

vast number of awards to 
be 
successful. 
She 
needs 

her voice, her songs and her 
fans. Taylor Swift appeared 
at the (socially distant) 2020 
Academy of Country Music 
Awards to perform the song 
“betty.” That award show had 
more viewers than the 2020 
VMAs despite the fact that 
country music isn’t a widely-
listened-to genre. The other 
performers played a part for 
sure, but it hardly seems a 
coincidence that the first time 
she showed up at the ACMs in 
seven years was the time that 
millions of people tuned in. She 
sat on a stage with her guitar, 
accompanied by a harmonica 
player 
in 
the 
background, 

and just sang. There was no 
audience, no light-up bracelets, 
no showmanship. It was just 
her, happily returning to her 
country roots. And she still 
managed to capture everyone’s 
attention.

That’s the power of Taylor 

Swift.

REPUBLIC

THE B-SIDE: ICONS
Icons: David Foster Wallace, beyond the windbreak

It was a year ago when I walked 

into the Dawn Treader Book Shop 
and squeezed past a few other 
patrons to reach the fiction section. 
On a low shelf in the Ws was a faded 
copy of Wallace’s debut novel “The 
Broom of the System.” 

I took the book to the counter 

and a man rang me up. I asked him 
if they had any of Wallace’s other 
books. 

“No, his stuff always sells fast.”
I said that was too bad, as I had 

just read “Infinite Jest” and I was 
looking to read more of his work. 
It was an admittedly pretentious 
brag, and he was not impressed. He 
smiled at me and dismissed me with 
a thin cheerfulness.

“Mm-hmm, well have a nice day.”
And that was that. To those that 

do not like his style, Wallace was 
an overblown mess of a writer — 
arrogant and too frequently labeled 
a genius, despite his books being 
bloated and forcefully intelligent. I 
suspect that the man at the counter 
at Dawn Treader was in this camp.

But 
I 
think 
Wallace 
was 

something else: a deeply troubled 
pop-hero who left his mark on the 
world through his art, his terror and 
his public presence. 

Before I say anything else, I want 

to present the first of Wallace’s 
words that I ever read, from the 
short story “Good Old Neon.” Keep 
them in mind:

“My whole life I’ve been a fraud. 

I’m not exaggerating. Pretty much 
all I’ve ever done all the time is try 
to create a certain impression of me 
in other people.”

***
As far as icons go, Wallace is 

one of the most quintessential. 
He wrote across multiple genres 
of literature, publishing fiction, 
nonfiction, speeches. His work is 
often unapproachable, his books 
so dense and overwritten that they 

almost feel actively averse to being 
read, and that’s what makes them 
attractive. 

Like many of Wallace’s readers, 

I made the mistake of jumping into 
his magnum opus “Infinite Jest” 
too quickly. I went from that first 
40-page short story to a 1079-page 
brick of a book with little regard for 
the health of my corneas.

“Infinite 
Jest” 
is 
more 
a 

monstrosity than a book. The 
pages are large and imposing, their 
combined weight dragging your 
hands to the floor. Following the 981 
pages of the main story is another 
90 pages of “Notes and Errata.” The 
endnotes are vital to the reader’s 
experience, though they sometimes 
left my head spinning as I flipped 
back and forth, back and forth.

The book is simply too chaotic 

and byzantine to summarize, but I 
will say this: the story mainly takes 
place in a tennis academy and a 
halfway house, and it deals with 
topics such as addiction, daddy 
issues, pervasive consumerism, a 
secret service of wheelchair-bound 
Quebecois assassins and a film so 
entertaining that its viewers watch 
it over and over again until they 
starve to death. 

It is as strange as it sounds, but 

Wallace 
embraces 
strangeness 

gracefully. In the mess of gaudy 
and sometimes grotesque language 
there is an undeniable humanity — 
Wallace touches on just about every 
emotion imaginable, every corner 
of human life from athletic stardom 
to copping cocaine to the loss of a 
loved one. And it isn’t his best work.

Don’t get me wrong, a thousand 

pages of wonderfully complex 
fiction is a fantastic achievement, 
one that would put any other writer 
at the top of 20th Century Classics 
lists before they retired to a villa 
somewhere. But Wallace wrote 
better stories. “Good Old Neon” 
is a masterclass in experimental 
structure and pacing, and you can 
read it in about an hour instead of 
a month. His most refined work, 

“The Pale King,” was published 
posthumously.

Before we get into that book, I 

want to take a look at Wallace as 
a person. Don’t worry, we’ll come 
back to his writing, but I first want 
to look at an interview that Wallace 
did with Charlie Rose.

At about three and a half minutes 

into the interview, Rose cuts 
the small-talk and asks Wallace, 
“Respect means a lot to you? Sort of 
the sense that ‘I’m taken seriously 
and respected for my work?’”

Wallace straightens in his chair 

and bites his lip before responding, 
“You can read this in my face? … 
Show me somebody who doesn’t 
like to be respected.”

Wallace then speaks to the 

public response to “Infinite Jest”, 
saying that he didn’t believe every 
reviewer finished the book before 
giving their verdict on it. At one 
point he interrupts his response to 
say, “... I’m sorry that I’m essentially 
stuttering, umm…” Rose reassures 
him, in a voice like that of a seasoned 
therapist, “No you’re not, you’re 
doing just fine.”

Wallace is taking the lead 

reluctantly in this dance. He 
doesn’t make much eye contact. 
He occasionally grimaces at his 
own comments. His voice sounds 
almost dreamy as he speaks low 
and quickly, like his thoughts are 
already loaded and he’s just letting 
them out. But they are just thoughts; 
he doesn’t try to imbue them with 
any special authority. Perhaps 
unknowingly, Wallace is acting out 
his 
every-man-but-not-just-any-

man persona.

This is the person we can see in 

interviews, the man who flexes his 
talent yet at the same time seems to 
almost repress it. But this is not the 
person who woke up every day and 
made coffee and walked the dogs. 
For a glimpse of that man, I’d like to 
share a story from my high school 
English teacher, Hunter Dunn.

Pasadena, 2005. Dunn sees a 

flyer for a workshop on teaching 

writing. There are three names on 
the list of speakers, including David 
Foster Wallace. Why did such a 
famous author appear at a workshop 
in a high school classroom for 40 
people? Dunn doesn’t know, but 
he suspects that it was a favor for a 
friend.

The workshop is held in a 

classroom in a high school across the 
street from Pomona College, where 
Wallace taught creative writing. 
The two other speakers go first, 
presenting their prepared materials 
and 
giving 
readings 
of 
their 

own work. Wallace has nothing 
prepared. He says something like, “I 
would never read my own work to 
students like that.”

At the end of the presentation, 

Dunn asks Wallace a question that 
he has since forgotten. But he still 
remembers 
Wallace’s 
response: 

“Okay, I’m going to answer your 
question, and then I want to know 
what you think.”

The workshop ends; everyone 

files out of the building. As he walks 
out, Dunn spots Wallace walking 
across a courtyard, probably back 
to his office at Pomona. He calls out, 
“Hey! Dave!”

Wallace turns around and sighs 

heavily, “Yes?”

Dunn asks him about an essay he 

wrote on the tennis player Michael 
Joyce. Wallace looks at him intently 
and says “Interesting player, isn’t 
he?”

The rest of the conversation has 

been lost in 15 years of memories, 
but Dunn recalls some key things 
about Wallace. He was an excellent 
listener, working out his thoughts 
before responding. But he was also 
curt, approaching every question 
as an argument, a game he wanted 
to win. He did not appear at all 
uncomfortable or self-conscious — 
he was a confident presence. 

Unlike in his interview with 

Charlie Rose, Wallace did not sound 
conflicted in-person. Perhaps when 
confronted with affirmation of the 
public belief in his brilliance, such 

as during a high-profile interview, 
his normal identity clashed with 
that expected of a genius.

That struggle is also present in 

his writing, but in a different way. 
Let’s return to “The Pale King.”

The story takes place at the IRS 

Regional Examination Center in 
Peoria, Illinois, a setting as boring 
as one can imagine. In a cool 550 
pages, Wallace breathes life into the 
banal and maddening world of tax 
return examination as if he were 
Tolkien constructing Middle Earth.

It was in “The Pale King” that I 

first started to find some clues of 
the real Wallace. The ninth chapter 
is labeled as “Author’s Foreword.” 
Wallace 
writes, 
“Author 
here. 

Meaning the real author, the living 
human holding the pencil, not some 
abstract narrative persona.” 

He explains, “what follows is, 

in reality, not fiction at all, but 
substantially true and accurate. 
That The Pale King is, in point 
of fact, more like a memoir than 
any kind of made-up story.” Of 
course, Wallace never worked for 
the IRS and the events in the book 
are completely fictional. But that 
doesn’t mean he is lying when he 
says the story is true, in a manner of 
speaking.

Wallace 
places 
himself 
in 

the story as a young IRS recruit 
who is mistaken for a high-level 
executive also named Dave Wallace. 
Scared to face the consequences 
of 
impersonating 
someone 
so 

well-respected, 
Dave 
Wallace 

(the character) goes along with 
the mistake and is swept into 
accordingly high-level meetings. 

Dave Wallace (the character) has 

no idea what is going on in these 
meetings. He sweats profusely 
and fumbles the few words he 
speaks. There is intense discussion 
of the tax code that the man he is 
impersonating should be intimately 
familiar with, but of course Dave 
Wallace (the character) knows 
nothing about the tax code. He 
stays silent so as not to reveal that 

he is not who people think he is. He 
writes down notes constantly, filling 
pages so that he will be perceived 
as a quiet but diligent observer, a 
focused participant in this world in 
which he knows he does not belong. 

If ever an author had spoken so 

clearly to their reader. 

***
Wallace committed suicide in 

2008. He left behind many books 
and essays, and in the continued 
publishing of his work he has 
become an icon. The dark sides of 
his life, drug addiction, his struggle 
with depression, have only added to 
his impression as a tortured genius.

In his 2013 biography “Every 

Love Story Is a Ghost Story: A Life 
of David Foster Wallace,” D.T. 
Max briefly mentions our subject’s 
relationship with the poet Mary 
Karr. Karr volunteered in a halfway 
house in Boston, where Wallace was 
living due to addiction and a suicide 
attempt. There is one particularly 
alarming sentence: “One night 
Wallace tried to push Karr from a 
moving car.”

Wallace’s relationship with Karr 

was mostly left in the dark, and it 
has fallen to Karr herself to speak 
out about it. He stalked her for 
years, even though she was married 
and had a child. He once showed up 
to a party with bandages on his arm, 
and revealed to Karr that he had 
tattooed her name on his skin.

It is very easy to dismiss 

this kind of darkness as part of 
the 
complications 
that 
come 

with genius. After all, is it not 
uncomfortable to think about the 
heinous acts committed by someone 
we like? To extend my consideration 
of a person past the safety of the 
products of their brilliance requires 
more emotional work than does 
reveling in the refined, beautiful 
things they gave to the world.

That is what it is to be an icon.

THE B-SIDE: ICONS
Bob Dylan: Queer icon?

ANDREW WARRICK

Daily Arts Writer

“Wearing high heel boots, a 

tailored pea-jacket without lapels, 
pegged dungarees of a kind of 
buffed azure, large sunglasses 
with squared edges, his dark, 
curly 
hair 
standing 
straight 

up on top and spilling over the 
upturned collar of his soiled white 
shirt,” an icon stepped off an 
airplane. It was November 1964, 
just outside Columbus. On the 
tarmac, “Businessmen nodded and 
smirked, the ground crew looked 
a little incredulous, and a mother 
put a hand on her child’s head and 
made him turn away.” 

Bob Dylan had arrived.
***
If you asked the average person in 

2020 about Bob Dylan, they would 
probably note his unconventional 
voice, his 2016 Nobel Prize for 
Literature or ’60s hits such as “Like 
a Rolling Stone” and “The Times 
They Are A-Changin.’” What they 
probably wouldn’t acknowledge is 
his relation to queerness. 

While 
not 
queer 
himself, 

two of Dylan’s most profound 
literary infleunces, poets Allen 
Ginsberg and Arthur Rimbaud, 
were 
uncompromisingly 
so. 

Their poetry reflected that. Since 
these two writers were vital to 
Dylan’s creative process, his most 
powerful albums are intimately 
related to the idea of queerness. 
While rarely, if ever, considered, 
a queer framework is vital to 
understanding Bob Dylan’s music 
and place as an American icon.

Wild Electric Visions 
“Old lady judges watch people in 

pairs, limited in sex, they dare, to 
push fake morals, insult and stare . . 
. And if my thought dreams could be 
seen, they’d probably put my head in 
a guillotine”

—“It’s Alright Ma (I’m Only 

Bleeding),” 1965

After stepping off the airplane, 

Bob Dylan was chauffeured to 
Kenyon College for a concert. 
When he learned that students 
were required to wear uniforms 
during the show, Dylan exclaimed 
“Ties? Well, I’m gonna tell them 
they can take them off. That’s what 
I’m gonna do. Rules — man, that’s 
why I never lasted long in college. 

Too many rules.” Dylan himself 
was about to break a whole lotta 
rules. 

He would soon pivot from his 

acoustic folk style, pick up an 
electric guitar and embark on a run 
of iconic albums now known as his 
Electric Trilogy: Bringing it All 
Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited 
and Blonde on Blonde. On top of this 
sonic reinvention, Dylan’s lyrical 
voice sharpened to a surrealistic, 
satirical switchblade, and slashed 
artistic and social conventions to 
tatters with every song. Key to this 
shift were two queer poets.

“Allen Ginsberg is the only 

writer I know,” Dylan said in ’66. 
“He’s just holy.” 

Ginsberg 
was 
a 
Beatnik 

notorious 
for 
his 
surrealistic 

poetry and blatant homosexuality, 
both of which challenged the 
norms of post-World War II 
American life. In the ’56 poem 
“America,” he asserts, “I won’t say 
the Lord’s prayer / I have mystical 
visions and cosmic vibrations” and 
asks the nation “When will you 
take off your clothes?” Ginsberg 
stood alone, championed being 
different 
and 
challenged 
the 

United States of America to do the 
same. Predictably, he was dragged 
into court.

After the ’56 publication of his 

masterpiece 
“Howl,” 
Ginsberg 

was “canceled” nationwide: Many 
bookstores banned his poetry 
and he was even put through 
an obscenity trial. Though the 
judge ruled in his favor, Ginserg 
was no national hero, and still 
relatively risqué, at the time of 
Bob Dylan’s Electric Trilogy in 
the mid-’60s. Yet Dylan called him 
holy. He also brought Ginsberg 
on tour and put him in one of 
the first music videos of all time, 
“Subterranean Homesick Blues.” 
More 
importantly, 
though, 

Dylan emulated Ginsberg in his 
songwriting. 

Allen Ginsberg’s wild, satirical 

style is all over the Electric Trilogy. 
One of the most potent examples 
is “Ballad of a Thin Man,” which, 
like “Howl,” blasts holes into mid-
century 
America’s 
traditional 

facade. In the song’s chorus, 
Dylan mockingly tells a character 
named Mister Jones, and by 
proxy 
masculine, 
upper-class 

white America, including those 

businessmen who laughed at him 
on that tarmac in ’64, “Something 
is happening here, but ya’ don’t 
know what it is, do you, Mister 
Jones?”

While scholarship has dissected 

the rebellion of “Thin Man,” the 
song’s relation to queerness is 
almost never mentioned or, if it 
is, isn’t taken very seriously. Yet a 
queer reading adds radical, perhaps 
even vital, shades to the song. “You 
walk into the room,” it begins. 
“With your pencil in your hand, 
you see somebody naked, And you, 
you say, ‘Who is that man?’ You try 
so hard, but you don’t understand.” 
By the time Dylan tells Jones “the 
sword swallower, he comes up to 
you, and then he kneels, he crosses 
himself, and then he clicks his high 
heels,” it’s almost too obvious. 

When viewed with Ginsberg’s 

context, it’s easy to see how the song 
challenged ’60s heteronormativity 
years before the Summer of Love, 
Stonewall and glam rock. Dylan 
shoved queerness into mainstream 
America’s face and mocked its 
privileged, prejudiced ignorance.

Another Electric Trilogy piece, 

“Maggie’s Farm,” similarly resisted 
American 
boundaries 
through 

a symbolic character, this time 
named Maggie. Her overbearing 
conservatism is similar to that of 
the mother who turned her boy 
away at the airport in ’64: 

“I ain’t gonna work on Maggie’s 

farm no more … I try my best to be 
just like I am, but everybody wants 
you to be just like them … I just get 
bored.”

Most critics view “Maggie’s 

Farm” as a general rebellion against 
American conventions, capitalism 
and authority. Yet a queer reading 
is relevatory; one oppressor at 
Maggie’s farm is Maggie’s mother, 
who “talks to all the servants about 
man and God and law.” Clearly 
paralleling Ginsberg’s refusal to 
say the Lord’s Prayer, this line will 
be familar to anyone who grew 
up queer in puritanical America. 
Subsequently, 
Dylan’s 
speaker 

escaping Maggie’s Farm becomes 
not just rebellion, but a necessary, 
touching escape.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The first time I understood 

George Balanchine was watching 
“The Nutcracker.” More precisely, 
it was while watching a recording 
of Act 2’s “Waltz of the Flowers” 
on YouTube, with New York 
City Ballet’s Ashley Bouder as 
the leading Dewdrop. The six-
minute dance is the culmination 
of 
the 
Christmastime 
ballet’s 

divertissements and the music 
builds with undulating waves of 
grandeur. Tchaikovsky sure knew 
how to write a good crescendo, but 
Balanchine knew how to dance it. 

In the video, Bouder does not 

jump, bounce or even float. She 
flies. Her movements, explosive 
and luxurious, stretch past the 
edges of her limbs. Her dancing 
leaves sparkles in the air — the kind 
that feel so pleasing to the eye that 
one might start to believe they are 
literally seeing the music in front of 
them. 

I grew up away from Balanchine, 

raised in dance studios that 
emphasized classical European 
ballet 
technique. 
Everything 

was 
square, 
everything 
was 

measured, everything was perfect. 
This system has its benefits and 
its beauty, but this moment on 
YouTube taught me (much like 
Balanchine taught the world) 
that sometimes those rules are 
overrated. 

When ballet first came to life long 

ago in the French courts of Louis 
XIV, it was a tool for control; court 
members showed dominance over 
their body’s motion to assert power. 
Balanchine’s immigration to New 

York City in 1933 reversed course on 
that centuries-long rule. Suddenly, 
hips didn’t need to be square 
and shoulders weren’t always 
straight. Fingers were splayed, 
knees could bend, and the need 
for restrained power came second 
to the need to match the music’s 
speed. The change was radical, but 
American concert dance loved it. 
Balanchine co-founded the New 
York City Ballet and its attached 
School of American Ballet with 
philanthropist Lincoln Kerstein. 
He choreographed 465 ballets in 
his lifetime and agitated the very 
existence of ballet in America. San 
Francisco Ballet, Pacific Northwest 
Ballet, Utah’s Ballet West, Miami 
City Ballet, Pennsylvania Ballet, 
Boston Ballet and Dance Theatre of 
Harlem were all created by artists 
touched by George Balanchine. 
By the time of his death in 1983, 
the world seemed to have already 
decided: He was a genius, and not 
in the hyperbolic sense of the word. 

This is all true. He is, by all 

accounts of the word, an icon. 
But there is inherent danger in 
words like these — in simple lables 
slapped onto complex people. Such 
categorizations encourage us to 
forget that Balanchine was a man, 
as flawed as the rest of us, living 
and working in the imperfect, non-
genius structures and systems of 
the 20th century. 

“Ballet is woman,” he said — but 

what kind? His muses were young, 
often still teenagers. They were 
skinny with small breasts and no 
butts, and their success created 
the silhouette of a dancer’s body 
that still wreaks havoc on women 
today. Floating beneath the surface 
of Balanchine’s legacy are eating 

disorders, body dysmorphia and 
an industry that makes casting 
decisions based on costume fittings 
rather than actual talent. 

Also 
beneath 
the 
surface 

rests ballets like “Le Chant du 
Rossignol,” an early Balanchine 
work that told the story of a sick 
Chinese emperor and relied heavily 
on destructive Orientalist tropes 
from its 1925 origins. When Ballet 
West revived the work in 2019, Final 
Bow for Yellowface co-founder Phil 
Chan spent the better part of his 
year facing off against historians 
who seemed to be too invested in 
respecting Balanchine’s genius to 
recognize the need to respect their 
Asian American peers. 

But perhaps the most notable, 

yet overlooked, factor complicating 
Balanchine’s legacy is Balanchine’s 
use of Black dance in his formation 
of American ballet, a point for which 
scholar Brenda Dixon Gottschild 
deserves immense credit. The 
opened chest, bent knees, increased 
speed and syncopated rhythms did 
not come from the singular mind 
of a European immigrant — they 
came from the street and social 
dances of Black Americans across 
the country. And yet, the master 
narrative of Balanchine’s memory 
often frames him as the inventor of 
such techniques. To this day, Black 
dance remains marginalized and 
belittled by the same white concert 
audiences that praise Balanchine’s 
innovation. In a 1996 book, Dixon 
Gottschild explains this under the 
title “Stripping the Emperor,” a 
phrase indicative of such erasure. 

The 

A love letter to Mr. Phoenix

The world has a thing for 

martyrs. People treat it like a rite 
of passage if you make it into the 27 
Club with Jimi Hendrix and Kurt 
Cobain. But River Phoenix never 
even got to see his 27th year.

Phoenix died from a drug 

overdose on Halloween when he 
was only 23. His death was, and 
remains to be, so sensationalized 
that you can even watch the 
guys at Buzzfeed Unsolved try to 
contact his ghost. National news 
stations aired the 911 call that his 
brother Joaquin Phoenix (“Joker,” 
“Her”) made from the Viper 
Room, the club owned by Johnny 
Depp (“Pirates of the Caribbean,” 
“Edward Scissorhands”) where 
River had collapsed. Long before 
social media, River’s life and 
death were treated like a sideshow 
attraction between commercials.

River was a reluctant icon. He 

hated his own celebrity (and the 
idea of celebrity at all), but he used 
it as a platform for his activism that 
could only be compared to the likes 
of Jane Fonda (“Klute,” “Grace 
and Frankie”) or Marlon Brando 
(“Streetcar Named Desire,” “The 
Godfather”). He spoke openly and 
passionately about animal rights 
and environmentalism in a time 
before there was a vegan option on 
every menu. Maybe he knew that 
PETA booked him because of his 
name as the precocious 17-year-
old nominated for an Oscar, but he 
swallowed his pride because it was 
what he believed in.

Humility isn’t always included 

in 
definitions 
of 
masculinity. 

River could have performed the 
hypermasculinity of contemporary 
stars like Arnold Schwarzenneger, 
Sylvester Stallone, Patrick Swayze 
or Tom Cruise, but he didn’t. 
This isn’t to say that he wasn’t 
masculine; he could play a young 
Harrison Ford in “Indiana Jones 
and the Last Crusade” with all the 
heroism we knew from the action 
star, but with this added fragility 
that’s difficult to achieve in a 
short, ten-minute cameo. River 
brought an intense, overwhelming 
amount 
of 
vulnerability 
that 

would underscore, rather than 
negate, his strength in each and 
every one of his roles. He made 
male tenderness iconic.

“Stand by Me,” based on the 

Stephen King novella “The Body,” 
is meant to be an ensemble film, 
but River’s performance as a 
tough but well-meaning kid from a 
dysfunctional family lit him up on 
everyone’s radar. The story started 
the “You wanna see a dead body?” 
trope as a group of middle school 
boys search for a local boy’s corpse 
in 1959. River may not be what 
most people remember most about 
the movie; it’s more recognizable 
as a clear influence of friendship-
centered adventures like “The 
Sandlot” or “Stranger Things,” and 
as a parallel to other adjacent films 
like “The Goonies” or (of course, 
because of its source material) 
“IT.” Director Rob Reiner (“When 
Harry Met Sally”) captures the 
playfulness and devastation of 
childhood through the image of 
some boys walking down railroad 
tracks together with the dramatic 
irony of their knowledge that it 

was a train that killed the boy 
they’re looking for. 

At its core, “Stand by Me” is 

about love. And while the other 
cast members did an amazing 
job, there’s just nothing that you 
can compare to River’s delivery 
of the line: “I just wish I could go 
someplace where nobody knows 
me.” He admitted to using fake 
tears in the scene (he was only 15 
years old and it was his first major 
role in a feature film), but you 
believe it when he says it. Maybe it’s 
that boyishness that had everyone 
magnetized to the screen. He was 
a kid in 1986 pretending he was 
in 1959, and you wonder if he was 
thinking of himself as his father, 
if this spoke to that feeling when 
you first see your father cry, when 
death stares you in the face, when, 
for the first time, you really, truly 
understand empathy.

I can’t help but wonder if 

“Stand by Me” was River’s way 
of reckoning with his childhood 
in the same way it is for everyone 
who watches the film. River was 
born to hippies who joined the 
Children of God cult when he 
was three. The cult was known 
for its interpretation of God’s love 
through sex, and particularly 
shared 
sex 
partners; 
cult 

members were coerced to sleep 
with recruits in order to convert 
them. Many cases of childhood 
sexual abuse have been reported 
by 
ex-members. 
It’s 
reported 

by Vanity Fair and supported 
by “Stand by Me” co-star Corey 
Feldman (“The Goonies”) that 
River was a victim of child sexual 
abuse. Joaquin Phoenix has since 
insisted that River’s confession to 

Details magazine was a joke made 
“because he was so tired of being 
asked ridiculous questions by the 
press.” 

We can’t know if River was 

a victim of abuse. It is a fact, 
though, that as the firstborn son 
of a family of seven, he often took 
his early acting jobs in order to 
provide for his family. It is a fact 
that the Children of God was a 
cult that attracted sex offenders, 
and even if River didn’t experience 
it firsthand, it’s not unlikely that 
he may have witnessed some of 
it. When his family left the cult, 
they left their given surname of 
the Arlyns behind and renamed 
themselves after the phoenix. 
In interviews, both River and 
Joaquin have looked fondly on 
their family life, describing a late-
’60s openness and an early-’70s 
closeness that kept them together 
after whatever may have happened 

while they were in the cult.

That openness is most apparent 

in “My Own Private Idaho.” Based 
loosely on Shakespeare’s “Henry 
IV” and “Henry V,” River plays 
Mike, a narcoleptic male prostitute 
hopelessly in love with his best 
friend Scott (Keanu Reeves, “John 
Wick”). Directed by Gus Van 
Sant (“Good Will Hunting”), it 
quickly became a cult classic and 
was inducted into the New Queer 
Cinema movement of the 1990s. 
River completely holds his own 
acting toe-to-toe with arguably 
the biggest action star of the ’90s. 
It’s like seeing fireworks for the 
first time: the thump hitting deep 
in your chest, the colors lighting 
up an otherwise dark night, and 
then that strange feeling when 
the show ends and you’re left with 
silence. 

And 
that’s 
without 
the 

knowledge that River himself 

wrote the iconic campfire scene 
where Mike confesses his love to 
Scott. Mike tries to talk about their 
friendship, asks what he means 
to Scott; Scott is confused, and 
maybe a bit put off. 

“I only have sex with a guy for 

money. And two guys can’t love 
each other,” Scott says.

Mike 
stutters 
out 
a 

noncommittal 
response, 

eventually admitting, “I love you 
and you don’t pay me. I really 
wanna kiss you, man.” 

Scott doesn’t say anything. 

Mike curls in on himself, hugging 
his knees until Scott holds him and 
a wolf howls in the distance.

It’s complete, utter, unguarded 

love. It frames the film in a 
completely different light than the 
original script.

Thinking of female film 
directors as famous icons

From the screen of a dark movie 

theater, a white horse stared at me, 
and I stared right back. At the time, 
I was 20, “LA dreaming,” working 
in California for the summer while 
taking classes at night, watching 
“Fish Tank” (2009) by Andrea 
Arnold in UCLA’s Mendelson 
theater. I sat with my arms 
wrapped tightly around my legs, 
pulling them into my chest so that 
my chin was imprinted red from 
being stuck between my knees. All 
my weight rested in my dirty-white 
Reeboks — they left a mark of muck 
on the leather seat beneath me. 

A bit later, the white horse died. 

It got shot on the day Mia (the main 
character) turned 16. It was the 
same day her dreams of becoming 
a dancer died, because a promising 
audition turned out to be a 
seductive scheme. It was the same 
day her mom’s friendly boyfriend 
turned out to be sexually deceitful 
towards Mia, with her birth control 
tossed aside when she needed it 
most. “Fish Tank” came to a close 
with Mia, her mother and her sister 
in the living room, mirroring each 
other, as they danced to Nas’ “Life’s 
a bitch.”

The blood vessel in my left eye 

popped — I forgot to blink. With my 
eye bloodied up, the lights turned 
bright and I felt my blood rush back 
into my feet, with red imprints on 
my chin and legs and cheeks from 
holding on too tightly. I sat squarely 
in the dirt my Reeboks left on the 
chair. 

I felt gritty and wrecked. I felt 

like Mia’s white horse was still 
there, with all her dreams and 
vulnerabilities staring at me. It felt 

like Arnold had changed the way 
my blood was flowing.

When I turned to my left to face 

my best friend Kemo, whom I’d 
met at the beginning of summer, I 
knew he felt this bloodied, tender 
rush too: He was looking at me 
with the smallest of smirks, which 
fell quickly into a more serious, 
contemplative look.

I wanted to dance, I wanted to 

call my mom and I really wanted 
to take the birth control pills I had 
missed for the past three days. 

***
Andrea 
Arnold 
— 
director 

of “Fish Tank” and “American 
Honey” (2019) — captures fleeting 
beauty and the essence of young 
women who are tightly stuck in 
the whirlpools of poverty they find 
themselves in, who bear the full 
brunt of babies and children and 
lost dreams and sexualization. She 
does this with delicacies: turtles let 

free in the ocean, white horses, flies 
and wasps stuck to honey — I fell 
utterly in love with Arnold’s work 
that summer. She wove herself into 
the helix of my DNA.

After watching “Fish Tank” in 

UCLA’s theatre alongside Kemo, 
we plowed through Arnold’s films 
“American Honey” and “Wasp” 
that same week. He and I would 
meet in the Common Room of our 
dorm to make those two bean bag 
chairs and that tiny TV our bitches. 

The vending machine always 

came first: I’d get two strawberry 
Nutri-Grain bars and he’d get fruit 
snacks. When other students would 
open the door to try and study, 
they’d usually see us throwing our 
favorite fruit snack flavors at each 
other, talking shit, with our eyes 
peeled on the screen. They would 
know they were intruding, and 
then they’d promptly leave.

In 
that 
over-air-conditioned 

common room we talked about our 
dreams, mostly. Who we wanted to 
be, what we wanted to create and 
be a part of. And maybe that’s why 
my love of Arnold is so strong: she 
makes films about what it means 
for young girls to have dreams, and 
she scares you just enough about 
what those dreams are susceptible 
to.

She’s an icon to me, but 

definitely not an icon to others, 
let alone known by others. And 
I find it extremely hard to distill 
my isolated idolization of Andrea 
Arnold down to a matter of 
“personal taste,” when not a single 
female is listed when you google 
“famous directors,” or when my 
friends can’t name a single female 
movie director.

T

he 
vigorous 
string 
melody 

halted, and the film came to an 
abrupt end. Dazed, my friend 

Haoyu and I sat silently in the darkness of 
State Theatre without moving an inch of 
our bodies. When we heard the sound of 
clapping from below us, we subconscious-
ly clapped along too. A warm yellow light 
slowly re-illuminated the theater. While 
people started getting up and preparing to 
leave, Haoyu and I were still glued to our 
seats, reluctant to let go of the beauty we 
just collectively experienced. 

“That was Vivaldi’s Four Seasons, 

wasn’t it?” A blonde woman sitting to my 
right asked her partner. “I wonder which 
one.”

“Summer,” I replied to her in a quiet 

and nasally voice, still wiping the tears 
from my cheeks and cleaning my glasses.

We had just finished watching “Por-

trait of a Lady on Fire,” a French historical 
romantic film that I couldn’t wait to see 
ever since its initial release in the United 
States. While walking back from State 
Theatre to East Quad, through the Diag 
and the stage set up for the Bernie Sanders 
rally, Haoyu and I talked nonstop about 
the film: Its absence of background music 
and male characters, its exquisite focus on 
facial expressions and the queer female 
love. The experience felt like a pilgrimage, 
where we exposed our most vulnerable in-
ner selves in a dark room of strangers. Our 
lonely hearts, hardened by worldly affairs 
like the tense political climate, depress-
ing job prospects and pressure from fam-
ily, opened up and were graced again by 
passion and love. Before we parted, Haoyu 
and I promised each other to attend more 
local film screenings together in the fu-
ture.

Neither of us knew that it would be 

the last time we saw each other for six 
months. In less than one week, on March 

13, the University had advised students to 
return home as soon as possible. Two days 
before, the Big Ten had then canceled the 
remainder of its winter season, all study 
abroad programs had been suspended un-
til April 21, and the spring commencement 
had been canceled. I had to pack up all of 
my belongings and say goodbye to all of 
my friends within the span of two days, 
flying back to Toronto before the borders 
closed. Haoyu, struggling to find a plane 
ticket back home to China, moved into her 
friend’s house near Ann Arbor.

After 14 days of quarantine back in To-

ronto, I regained control of my own room 
and made it my sanctuary. Behind my shut 
bedroom door, I took refuge in cinema, as 
it provided me with a sense of comfort and 
detachment from the atrocities outside 
my room. Sometimes at a friend’s house, 
though most of the time alone, I wandered 
through my Netflix recommendations. 
From Hirokazu Kore-eda’s direction in 
heartwarming family dramas to Ghibli 
animations to Billy Wilder’s black and 
white classics. These films, whether sad 
or bittersweet, acted as my shield from 
the outside world’s worsening xenopho-
bia, racism and violence, allowing me to 
escape from reality and to the safe haven 
of cinema.

Though I thoroughly enjoyed all the 

films I watched on my own, the “bedroom 
theater” experience was still unequal to 
the in-person ones I had in Michigan. 
Throughout the entire summer, I was 
looking forward to when things returned 
to normal and theaters would open again 
without masks required upon entry. A 
drive-in movie simply would not suffice. 
Though the leather seats and air condi-
tioning are able to provide the viewers 
with a false sense of comfort, the cold 
hard metal separates us from the rest of 
the audience, rendering a supposedly col-

lective experience an isolated one. 

There is something about a crowded, 

dark room and the tiny, red seats that fos-
ter something personal yet surreal. I have 
always found consuming good art a very 
demanding process because it requires me 
to exhaust my emotional energy to truly 
understand and empathize with the artist 
or artist’s characters. Therefore, to expose 
myself in such a vulnerable state and un-
dergo such a process is both intimate and 
valuable to my viewing experience.

To me, the audience in the theater are 

time travelers who happened to stumble 
upon the same time machine. Our bodies 
get sucked into the black hole of cinema 
as our souls distort and mesh with each 
other. By the time the credits roll and 
light refills the room, we leave and return 
to our ordinary lives, but we carry with us 
a shared sentiment and love unique to the 
stories we witnessed together.

I remember when my friend Sarah and 

I went to a “Parasite” screening together, 
excited for the Korean film’s debut in Ann 
Arbor. As the film’s climax approached, 
we looked at each other with our mouths 
opened in a silent scream and clutched 
each other’s hands tightly like little kids 
tucked under the same blanket. I remem-
ber how the entire theater held their 
breath as (spoiler alert) Mister Kim picked 
up the knife from the lawn and stabbed it 
through Mr. Park’s chest. 

The deafening silence was nowhere 

near awkward or uncomfortable, but 
rather an embodiment of how a room of 
strangers can be united through an im-
mersive experience in art without verbal 
interaction. In this case, the audience 
communicated through their silence. It 
was our collective affirmation in the film’s 
shrewd yet harsh portrayal of our society 
— a silent echo of our common humanity.

W

hen Gov. Gretchen Whit-
mer announced that theaters, 
bowling alleys and other per-

formance venues will be able to reopen on 
Oct. 9, I was shocked. While I am delighted 
that theaters will be back in business and 
welcome movie fanatics back to their ven-
ues, I still hold a sense of skepticism about 
the policy’s feasibility.

Though the theaters will only be allowed 

at 20% capacity, the local Ann Arbor theaters 
are still narrow spaces with possibly inade-
quate air circulation, especially since smaller 
theaters have less funding to upgrade their 
buildings. Many questions come to mind: 
Will people’s temperatures be taken upon 
entry and concessions be allowed during 
the film? Will I be able to enjoy the films the 
same way I did before the pandemic? 

The most important element of attend-

ing a film in person is not the moving pic-
tures playing on the big screen, but rather 
the memories I make with my friends and 
the collective experience that I share with 
the other viewers. The effectiveness of the 
public health precautions largely depend 
on the viewers’ choice to follow them, but 
with the University of Michigan’s dras-
tic increase of weekly COVID-19 cases, I 
must regretfully admit that I feel unsafe in 
our community. 

Every so often, I daydream about the 

next time I will have an intimate experi-
ence at a movie theater, just like when I 
went to see “Portrait of a Lady on Fire.” 
I picture the lights dimming, the pictures 
pulling me in like a warm blanket, gently 
wrapping around me, gradually lulling the 
audience while we embark on a journey to 
the mystic dreamland of cinema. Yet now, 
as the pandemic rages and our country 
hurts, this daydream feels far away; the 
blanket remains threadbare and tattered, 
and I will not be tucking myself in for a 
long time to come.

Intimacy Denied: 
Reopening theaters 
during a pandemic

BY LOLA YANG, STATEMENT CORRESPONDENT

F

or the first 18 years of my life, I lived 

about a hundred yards away from 

my grandmother’s house. As a kid, 

I’d skip down the street to her house for a din-

ner of PopTarts and games of Kings in the Cor-

ner, “PBS NewsHour” always playing on the 

TV in the background. The TV volume muffled 

the sound of the back door, so I’d tiptoe as far 

into the living room as I could before announc-

ing my arrival, to surprise her. We’d catch the 

end of the broadcast before dessert: white wine 

for her, an ice cream bar for me, “Antiques 

Roadshow” for us both. 

 Throughout my childhood, I watched 

hundreds of hours of the evening news at her 

house. But somehow I remember very little 

— I can only hear the “60 Minutes” clock tick-

ing away on Sundays and recall that I thought 

stocks were physical towers rebuilt each morn-

ing. I can hear her sharp, rocky voice commen-

tating on the TV programs, in both agreement 

and dissent, and her asking me to turn the vol-

ume up. Beside this occasional analysis, our 

conversations mostly revolved around piano 

and school, two things she cares deeply for. 

 At my own house, I spent years laying on 

the kitchen floor in front of the heating vent 

reading Newsweek. I remember election night 

2008 — my parents sent me to bed before the 

results were announced, but my mom later 

snuck in to tell me that Obama won. I remem-

ber discussing Jennifer Granholm, the 2009 

stimulus package and abortion at the kitchen 

table. 

 The women in our family tend to be stub-

born and opinionated and I grew louder in high 

school by writing, photographing and editing 

for the Wind-Up, my school’s newsmagazine. 

I had a byline and a habit of making the prin-

cipal nervous. And while my views may have 

contradicted hers, my grandmother’s name re-

mained faithfully at the top of our sponsors list 

— though I sometimes made sure her copy got 

lost in the mail. 

 Today, my grandmother is 89 years old, and 

I’m a 21-year-old college senior at her alma 

mater. We keep our conversations limited to 

my classes, Ann Arbor and her health after her 

stroke last year. I see her much less often. She 

spends most of her time in a wheelchair, alone 

in her home, watching TV — but this time, in-

stead of the British voices of “PBS NewsHour” 

or the juicy profiles of “60 Minutes,” Tucker 

Carlson’s voice reigns in her living room. My 

grandmother, now, spends all day watching 

Fox News. 

 I’ll be honest. I don’t have many conserva-

tive friends, and almost zero Trump-support-

ing ones. I blocked the president on Twitter in 

2016 for the sake of my anxiety, and like most of 

Gen Z, I don’t have cable TV. Other than the oc-

casional clips that dot my Twitter feed, I almost 

never watch Fox.

 Until her stroke, my grandmother read 

the Wall Street Journal every day and mostly 

watched PBS. She went to lunch with friends, 

ran errands on her own and we’d still initiate 

political conversations at dinner. But since 

her stroke, and especially since COVID-19, 

she hasn’t left her house, she’s only seen her 

home aides and close family and has stopped 

reading the newspaper. Her transforma-

tion from lifelong conservative to a person I 

didn’t recognize wasn’t solely because of Fox 

News, and I’m far from the first to “lose” a 

family member or friend to the network. 

 But I felt I had to at least try. So this past 

week, I grabbed a notebook and recorder and 

walked the hundred yards to her living room. 

I asked her to tell me about Fox News and 

what she believed and why. We hadn’t talked 

politics in several years, aside from her call-

ing me a socialist during a wine-induced 

conversation a few months prior. My mask 

helped hide both the exhaustion I’ve built 

up over the past four years and the smile I’ve 

been wearing since recently coming out — 

another part of me she’ll never know about. 

I sat in a brown wooden chair, six feet and 

a world away from her, captivated by the 

familiar — her language, distrust and fear — 

and the foreign: her.
I

n an essay for the Atlantic, “Do You 

Speak Fox?”, Megan Garber explains 

how Fox has capitalized on an identity 

of fear. 

 “Fox has two pronouns, you and they, and 

one tone: indignation. (You are under attack; 

they are the attackers.) Its grammar is griev-

ance. Its effect is totalizing,” she explained. 

“Over time, if you watch enough Fox & Friends 

or The Five or Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity 

or Laura Ingraham, you will come to under-

stand, as a matter of synaptic impulse, that im-

migrants are invading and the mob is coming 

and the news is lying and Trump alone can fix 

it.”

In an essay for New York Magazine, Boston-

based writer Luke O’Neil crowdsourced stories 

from people who’d experienced the same con-

version with their loved ones. 

“No matter where the stories came from 

they all featured a few familiar beats: A loved 

one seemed to have changed over time ... At 

one point or another, they sat down in front of 

Fox News, found some kind of deep, addictive 

comfort in the anger and paranoia, and became 

a different person — someone difficult, if not 

impossible, to spend time with.” 

 Nearly all of the respondents were adults 

writing about their parents, or someone de-

scribing a falling out with their spouse. Fox’s 

audience demographics are no secret: they’re 

74% white, 44% middle class and 17% hold a 

college degree. They’re trusted most by Repub-

licans and distrusted most by Democrats. And 

of Americans 65 and older, 37% say Fox is their 

main source of political news. 

 “Fox didn’t necessarily change anyone’s 

mind, so much as it seems to have supercharged 

and weaponized a politics that was otherwise 

easy for white Americans to overlook in their 

loved ones,” O’Neil writes. 

 My grandmother’s politics were easy to 

overlook, for a while. We’ve never been more 

divided, and I’ve gone back and forth on 

whether our relationship can handle the con-

versations I’d like to have with her. I’m not 

sure we’ll ever see eye-to-eye on much, but as 

someone entering the journalism field in just 

a few months, it’s hard to watch her belief in 

truth slip away. I wasn’t there to fight with her 

or change her mind, which was good because I 

was about two years too late. I began by asking 

where she got most of her news and why she 

relied on Fox.

 Five minutes and 33 seconds into the inter-

view, she began to cry.

 “I feel this country’s just going to pot with 

all these liberals wanting to burn the country 

down and start over,” she said. “I think that’s 

so wrong. I do believe in our Founding Fathers 

and they did a lot — they were very smart peo-

ple and they worked hard, they had very good 

ideas.” 

 She broke off, and I got up to find tissues. 

 “You’re all not going to have as good a life 

as I’ve had,” she said, alluding to my genera-

tion. 

 “They’re ruining your lives by burning the 

whole country down. And who wants to live 

through all these riots in every city?” 

 She paused and took a deep breath, her 

voice flooding with anxiety. “I just wish 

Trump would go in with the National Guard 

and put those people in jail.” 

 It was baffling to hear her distressed by 

things and events that I perceive so differ-

ently. I was thankful my mask could hide my 

shock and confusion — with that explanation, 

I wasn’t even sure where to start. I sat latching 

onto my shirt sleeve, quietly saying to her, “It’s 

OK, Grandma. Breathe for a second.” 

 I silently reminded myself that this anxi-

ety is a direct result of the bubble she’s in, not 

necessarily her whole character. In moments 

of despair at the state of our country, I’ve been 

wondering if some people really just don’t 

have empathy — do they truly not care about 

their neighbors? What about people they’ll 

never meet? My grandmother will never meet 

the people protesting for Black lives in Chi-

cago or Portland. She’s not evil, but she’s been 

conditioned to be afraid of what she doesn’t 

know. The way she ingests news, she will only 

ever hear that Black Lives Matter protestors 

are rioters, intent on tearing down our cities. 

I believe a completely different narrative, in-

formed by the places I get my news.

 “Fox foments fear and loathing not really 

because of a Big Brotherly impulse, but be-

cause the network has recognized that fear and 

loathing, as goods, are extremely marketable,” 

Garber writes. 

 A similar story to mine appeared in the Bos-

ton Globe, written by freelancer Linda Rodri-

guez McRobbie. She wrote about Jen Senko, 

whose father had descended into anger and 

fear after consuming hours of talk radio every 

day.

 “A man who’d made his children read for 

an hour before bedtime, who always told them 

that higher education was the most worth-

while thing they could do, became suspicious 

of universities as liberal incubators. A man 

who used to stop people on the street when 

he heard an accent he didn’t recognize to say 

hello now didn’t like immigrants or Hispanic 

people. A man who’d welcomed his children’s 

gay friends into his home ‘didn’t want it in his 

face’ anymore.” 

 I wouldn’t say my grandmother used to 

stop people on the street to say hello, but she 

certainly wasn’t as paranoid as she’s become. 

Her idea of the truth has become so distorted 

that I had a hard time understanding her ex-

planation. “Where does your trust in Fox come 

from?” I had to ask. 

 “
Just watching them,” she said. “I call that 

the real news and I call the other the fake news. 

I can’t say that I ever felt they were lying. Now 

you keep hearing the other side saying that 

Trump lies all the time. I said, I don’t know 

where he lies because I don’t have all the fig-

ures. And if he says, I made this much money 

for the country, you know, I don’t know those 

facts. So it might be that he exaggerated.” She 

believes liberals, like Nancy Pelosi, don’t use 

the facts and will lie about things all the time. 

 We agreed that most journalists work to tell 

the truth — that the ideals of the profession still 

remain and it’s more crucial now than ever. We 

disagree on exactly who is doing their job cor-

rectly. We disagree on almost everything, really. 

 It’s hard to comprehend how far apart we 

are, though the physical distance between us 

is usually less than a football field. I’m a col-

lege senior, dating a woman for the first time, 

preparing to plunge into the journalism world, 

seeking out new friendships and squeezing the 

last drops out of my education. My grandmoth-

er is largely alone in her house, with medical 

conditions, during a pandemic and with only 

one constant companion: Fox News. Our situ-

ation is a tangible example of the larger dis-

course happening in the U.S., one that’s ex-

hausting and scary. My grandmother and I will 

never fully cross this divide together, though I 

know shouting from our respective sides of the 

chasm won’t do, either. We’re two generations, 

a hundred yards and now six feet apart, but in 

2020, I’ll take what I can get.

On making 
friends during a 
pandemic

BY LEAH LESZCZYNSKI, STATEMENT COLUMNIST

E

ver since I arrived on campus last year, vetting 

classmates in discussions, student organization 

meetings and informal gatherings, in hopes of 

creating more fulfilling human connections has become 
second nature to me.

Prior to the new world created by the COVID-19 pan-

demic, typical student life provided numerous opportu-

nities to spark relationships with those around us. This 

semester, 78% of undergraduate credits and many student 

organizations are taking place entirely online — the vir-

tual format undoubtedly proposes a unique, less desirable 

situation for learning and student interaction than “nor-

mal” circumstances. Further, the benefits of the limited 

number of in-person classes, events and serendipitous 

moments are thwarted by differing levels of fear of a high-

ly contagious virus, the spread of which is highly related 

to human proximity. Today, fewer 

conversations between classmates 

follow them out the door of their 

discussion room, no packed dining 

halls encourage interaction among 

students sharing a table and no fans 

in the Big House means no student 

season ticket holders will harmonize 

over a chorus of “Mr. Brightside” 

during the 2020 football season. 

LSA sophomore Samuel Levy told 

me about his entirely remote class 

schedule over email.

“I’d say the obstacles I’ve faced 

are due to the very procedural and 

formal aspect of Zoom,” Levy said. 

“It just feels way too formal and ev-

eryone focuses on the work. Obvi-

ously, this is probably the best-case 

scenario in terms of class, but for 

making friends, it’s not.”

Regardless of whether a student 

is a seasoned senior or clueless 

freshman, on or off campus, follow-

ing or ignoring public health guide-

lines, outgoing or introverted, the 

ability to maintain and make new 

friends seems to be another aspect 

of student life that has been radically 
transformed by this virus. 

LSA freshman Makayla Beardsley 

shared her struggle to make friends 

after arriving on a campus unrecog-

nizable to the traditional expecta-

tions of what college life looks like.

“There was a long period of time 

when I first got here that I didn’t re-

ally try to meet any friends,” Beard-

sley said. “I (could not) really go to 

anyone’s dorm room and (could not) 

even see anyone’s faces unless we 

were eating due to masks, so I got 

stuck asking ‘What’s the point?’”

This perspective is understand-

able, and I cannot imagine how difficult it is for incom-

ing students to be starting their lives at the University of 

Michigan amid this pandemic. Even in normal times, it is 

hard enough to adjust to the college experience and make 

meaningful connections in a new place, but trying to be-

come part of the University’s community virtually is not a 

challenge most incoming students anticipated or prepared 

for when picturing and planning their college years. 

Asked about the new aspects of life taking place vir-

tually, Levy wrote, “A lot of people believe that making 

friends, or even dating, online is the last resort. Although I 

don’t necessarily agree with this, I think that the reason it 

is perpetuated so often is because there is a lack of ‘seren-

dipitous moments’ when meeting anyone online.”

There is something to be said about the compara-

tive value of in-person connections. Looking back on my 

freshman year, the night I shared a twin XL bed with three 

friends in Markley for a “Riverdale” marathon and then 

sang Van Morrison’s “Brown Eyed Girl” to the 2 a.m. audi-

ence in the communal bathroom is among my most trea-

sured serendipitous moments of college. None of my fond-

est memories from my first seven months of college were 

made with Zoom, FaceTime or Snapchat. 

Today, these types of moments, marked by gut-wrench-

ing laughter and togetherness, are more difficult to have. 

The opportunities to even make friends to share these ex-

periences — whether virtually, or with masks — are few 

and far between. Levy himself has felt this.

“After class is over, everyone just leaves Zoom and goes 

on with their lives,” he said. “If we were in person, just the 

physical act of being together when class ends and col-

lectively walking out of class definitely makes it easier to 

strike up conversations with anybody outside of class.”

LSA freshman Caitlyn Bloomburg told me about mak-

ing friends in the dorms during the pandemic. 

“There are some people who will stop to have a con-

versation with you in the hallway, but there are also the 

people who will just look down and walk by, and try to 

keep their distance.”

On top of the virus severely reducing the number of op-

portunities to make friends, some students are finding it 

harder to maintain relationships cemented by in-person 

interactions from six months ago before the full force of 

the pandemic hit. 

“Most of the friends I have made aren’t on campus this 

semester, so the only contact that I do have with them is 

online,” Levy said. “As for the friends I have on campus, I 

can’t meet up with them because of COVID. I have been 

interacting with all of them through texting and some-

times FaceTiming, but other than that, nothing else.”

Beardsley experienced a similar struggle.

“Some of the friendships I’ve had have definitely got-

ten tested due to COVID social distancing guidelines,” she 

said. “Because my current friends back home are all at dif-

ferent colleges, we only interact through social media and 

phone calls, but we’ve tried our best to make it work while 

still trying to keep everyone safe.”

Simply put, friends are important, to our social and aca-

demic well-being, our health and thus our quality of life. 

Friends provide support in all aspects of life, and in col-

lege, when family is often hundreds of miles away, friend-

ships are often looked upon to share struggles and provide 

reassurance and comfort.

Former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy investigated 

the importance of human connection in his book “Togeth-

er” by exploring loneliness as an epidemic itself, as well 

as its role in numerous national epidemics — thereby pro-

posing the question of how the loneliness epidemic may 

be exacerbated by the current pandemic. Even before CO-

VID-19 turned many of our lives upside down, the men-

tal health of college students was 

particularly concerning to public 

health experts, with increasing rates 

of anxiety and depression among our 

demographic in recent years. Now, 

during a time of increased isolation 

and stress about the state and future 

of our world (and even the continu-

ance of our democracy) brought on 

by the pandemic, the increased dif-

ficulty of making and maintaining 

friendships makes this time period 

a great test of our mental resilience. 

Notwithstanding the tribulations 

of life in a pandemic, students have 

pursued and created new opportuni-

ties to make friends and meaningful 

connections. 

Bloomburg told me about her ef-

forts to make friends this semester. 

“I joined the Class of 2024 Facebook 

page, and people were posting bios 

about themselves … so if I had stuff 

in common with people I would add 

them on Snapchat or Instagram.” 

She also shared that her resident ad-

viser has a “speed friending” Zoom 

call in the works to facilitate connec-

tions in her dorm hall.

Needless to say, the role of social 

media is becoming more integral to 

the student experience with each 

passing week that this pandemic 

keeps study spaces socially dis-

tanced and a large number of stu-

dents off campus altogether. Reach-

ing out to find students with similar 

interests seems to have become com-

monplace on Facebook, and Reddit 

is no stranger to posts plainly asking 

for new friends. 

Regardless of how we manage to 

find friends and maintain friend-

ships we are particularly grateful to 

have made before this pandemic, it is hard to find the same 

joy and make the same connections on FaceTime calls 

and through Zoom breakout rooms. It is hard to navigate 

the complex matters of making and maintaining friend-

ships even without a pandemic forcing time spent with 

our friends and peers into one-dimensional squares on a 

screen. The most practical and, indeed, the only answer is 

to make the best of it. 

Throughout my interviews for this article, I found reas-

surance in knowing that I am not the only one struggling 

to find new friends and maintain my current friendships 

right now. Over the past month, I have found comfort in 

being met with unanimous enthusiasm after asking class-

mates to join a group chat for our shared class. Aside 

from the placement of French pronouns and the themes 

of Thomas Paine’s “Agrarian Justice,” the most valuable 

thing I have learned so far this semester is that people des-

perately want to connect — it is just a matter of someone 

making the first attempt.

Ten months into his first 

season on a Division I coaching 
staff at Illinois State, 37-year-old 
Luke Yaklich created a Microsoft 
Word file on his computer. He 
named it “When I Become a Head 
Coach.”

Yaklich divided the file into 

four sections: offense, defense, 
culture and recruiting. Tidbits 
of information — gleaned from 
picking the brains of other 
coaches 
and 
scouts, 
reading 

books, watching online clinics 
and just being around the game 
— were partitioned into the 
different categories. 

In 
terms 
of 
the 
college 

coaching circuit, Yaklich had only 
just dipped his toes into the water. 
Being a Division I head coach 
seemed like a pipe dream, but so 
had being an assistant coach at 
that level. It was impossible to 
know where exactly his journey 
would lead him next. 

“It was, ‘Okay, if I ever do get a 

head coaching job, I’m not going 
to have all the answers, and it’s 
going to change when I actually 
meet my team and figure out 
what we’re going to be good at,’ 
” Yaklich said. “But you want to 
have a base of things that you can 
fall back on and say, ‘Okay, I like 
this, I like that.’ ”

On March 26, Yaklich, age 

44, got his chance. The former 
Michigan assistant coach was 
hired to be the head coach at the 
University of Illinois-Chicago, 
a middle-of-the-pack program 
in the Horizon League. With 14 
seasons of high school coaching 
experience, 7 years in the college 
ranks, and a full portfolio of 
notes at his disposal, Yaklich was 
prepared. 

To an extent, at least. 
“None of that had COVID in 

it,” Yaklich said with a laugh, 

taking a moment to relish in the 
absurdity of navigating his first 
college head coaching gig in the 
throes of a global pandemic. 
“There’s no manual or chapter in 
the head coaching book to figure 
out how exactly to put a program, 
a staff and a roster together in the 
middle of a pandemic.” 

To label it as too steep a 

challenge, 
though, 
would 
be 

a foolish exercise. He’s been 
through the wringer, no stranger 
to the grind requisite for coaching. 

Not too long ago, Yaklich spent 

countless hours traversing rural 
Illinois on a rickety school bus 
as the head coach of Joliet West 
High School. Before Joliet, he did 
the same at Sterling and then later 
La-Salle Peru Township, all while 
doubling as a high school history 
teacher. And before that, he took 
care of the thankless behind-
the-scenes duties as a student 

manager for Illinois State. 

Point being: For Yaklich, the 

pandemic is just another hurdle 
to climb. 

“We do what we ask our players 

to do, which is to respond and 
handle the situation that’s in front 
of you in the best possible way 
with everything that you have,” 
Yaklich said. “And that’s what our 
guys and our staff have done.” 

After taking the job at UIC, 

Yaklich wasted no time getting to 
work. Hunkered down in his new 
home-office in Austin, Texas, he 
rounded out his coaching staff, 
retaining one assistant from the 
prior regime and hiring two more 
from Bryant and North Dakota 
State.

The four of them, spread out 

across four different states, set out 
to piece together a roster. UIC’s 
three top scorers from the 2019-
20 season had graduated, leaving 

sizable holes. Tackling recruiting 
through a computer screen and 
over the phone, Yaklich brought 
on six transfers to pair with a 
three-man freshman class. 

“The main thing that I tried 

to really establish is just getting 
to know everybody as people, 
rather than players,” Yaklich 
said. “I was making sure that the 
human connection was first and 
foremost. 

“We did some team activities 

over Zoom. It really ended up 
being a unifying thing, that going 
into it, you may not have seen it 
as such, but our guys grew. Then 
when they finally got together, 
there was a connection and an 
excitement to be in the gym 
together.” 

That came on July 6, 96 days 

after Yaklich was first hired. 

“We learned to appreciate the 

time together in the gym and the 

opportunity to play together and 
to be a part of a team,” Yaklich 
said. “We realized how quickly 
that time can be taken away.”

Once allowed to return to the 

gym, the offseason more closely 
resembled 
normalcy. 
Players 

worked out in pods. Defensive 
drills, Yaklich’s calling card, 
abounded. Seven years after he 
started typing in that empty Word 
document, Yaklich could finally 
see his ideas put into motion. 

When Yaklich got his first 

men’s 
high 
school 
coaching 

position at Sterling in 2000, he 
attempted to produce a carbon 
copy of the system he knew from 
his time at Illinois State. The 
experiment went poorly — “like 
trying to fit a square peg into a 
round hole,” Yaklich says. 

Twenty years later, Yaklich, 

now the disciple of Dan Muller, 
John Beilein and Shaka Smart, 

has plenty to draw from while 
building his program at UIC. 
When instilling a program-wide 
culture — the preeminent item 
on his head coaching agenda — 
Yaklich turns to Beilein. 

“The one thing with Coach 

B was really having a culture 
that you can live out on and off 
the court,” Yaklich said. “You 
knew what to expect each and 
every day as a staff, and then as 
a player, because everything was 
grounded back to the core values 
that Coach believed in. It created 
an identity of the program and a 
sense of belonging to the culture.

“So we’re just trying to grow 

our players one percent better as 
students, athletes, players and 
young men. I think if you really 
do that, you’re going to create a 
family culture because the people 
that you’re working with are 
going to know that you care and 
that’s going to carry over to what 
we call the three C’s: classroom, 
community and the court. And 
we want to create an environment 
where our guys are high achievers 
in all three of those areas.”

With the season approaching, 

the 
unconventionality 
that 

defined Yaklich’s first six months 
on the job is in the rearview 
mirror. As the familiar rhythm 
of practices and games pick up 
again, he can lean on all he’s 
learned from his journey.

“We’re just making the most 

of our eight hours together (per 
week) now that the NCAA has 
allowed us,” Yaklich said. “It’s 
been a great experience. Our guys 
have embraced everything like 
champions.”

The 
focus 
now 
rests 
in 

organization, 
highlighting 

different 
aspects 
he’s 

implemented and marking off 
other details that still need to be 
contrived.

And Yaklich, ever upbeat, is 

ready to continue giving it his all 
with whatever cards he’s dealt.

Hunter Dickinson impressing his 
teammates and coaches early on

According to 247Sports, Hunter 

Dickinson 
was 
rated 
as 
the 

42nd-best high school prospect in 
the 2020 class. 

Just a few months ago, though, 

in a Michigan recruiting class that 
included five-star Isaiah Todd and 
was on the verge of adding five-star 
Josh Christopher, Dickinson was 
somewhat of an afterthought. It 
seemed back then that the 7-foot-1 
center out of Maryland powerhouse 
DeMatha Catholic was going to 
be a noteworthy pickup for the 
Wolverines but wasn’t going to be 
the headliner of a loaded class.

Then 
Christopher 
spurned 

Michigan for Arizona State and 
Todd opted for the NBA G-League 
in lieu of college ball. Suddenly, 
Dickinson was the featured name 
of a solid class.

Though it’s early in Dickinson’s 

career, 
the 
Wolverines 
may 

already have a gem on their hands 
according to those around the 
program.

“His abilities on the court 

though are why we went so 
hard after him in the recruiting 
process,” Michigan assistant coach 
Saddi Washington said. “Much like 
Jon (Teske), he just has a presence 
with his size and his length. He’s 
an elite-level passer, he can handle 
the ball and get his shot from 

the perimeter. So he has all the 
attributes that coach Juwan has 
looked for in that position.”

Added guard Mike Smith, a 

graduate transfer from Columbia: 
“It’s crazy how different it is from 
high-major to mid-major and low-
major in terms of talent. Like with 
Hunter, having a 7-foot-1 dude 
who can stretch the floor like that 
and post-up. You don’t see that 
everywhere.”

Dickinson’s offensive versatility 

is his strong point. While he can 
shoot the midrange jumper and has 
a soft touch around the basket, his 
7-foot-1, 255-pound frame allows 
him to bully smaller opponents 
down low. 

As with most freshmen, though, 

his ability to learn and execute 
defensive 
schemes 
will 
likely 

dictate whether the Wolverines 
can keep him in the lineup. 

“Defending 
and 
rebounding 

are two things that it normally 
takes young guys a while to grasp,” 
Washington said. “Most freshmen 
come in pretty high level from an 
offensive perspective, but I think 
the guys that really understand 
early defensive principles, being 
able to defend without fouling, 
rebounding at a high level, those 
are the guys that get a lot of 
opportunities to play. So we’re 
definitely going to try and grow 
Hunter in those areas so that we 
can find ways to keep him on the 
floor.”

With 
center 
Jon 
Teske 

graduated, Michigan sorely needs 
a shot-blocker. Dickinson, who 
averaged 2.1 blocks during his 
senior year of high school, fits that 
bill. Dickinson will have to face a 
number of talented and imposing 
big men in the Big Ten — Luka 
Garza, Kofi Cockburn and Trevion 
Williams to name a few — so 
avoiding foul trouble is a must as 
well. 

In addition to Dickinson’s play 

on the court, his presence off of it 
has also impressed his coaches and 
teammates.

“Man, the kid has swag and 

confidence,” 
Washington 
said. 

“That stood out from the beginning, 
just his belief in himself and his 
ability. But even as a person, he’s a 
very funny and outgoing guy. He’s 
just a fun young man to be around.”

Added fifth-year center Austin 

Davis: “I love Hunter, man. He’s 
a character. He brings a lot to the 
locker room besides basketball. He 
gets along really well with everyone 
on the team and works his tail off.”

Dickinson’s name may not have 

initially resonated with Michigan 
fans like Todd or Christopher’s, but 
the Wolverines’ top-rated recruit 
seems to have the skill set and now, 
opportunity to shine.

“He’s going to be a tremendous 

asset to the team on both ends of 
the floor,” Davis said. “So I’m really 
excited to see what we can do with 
him this year.”

Players, coaches build chemistry as 

practice resumes

Limited ice time, no locker 

room access and lots of Tik Toks. 

It’s been an unprecedented and 

longer-than-usual offseason for 
Michigan as it continues to await 
the announcement of a hockey 
season. 
The 
Wolverines 
will 

get ready to face tough Big Ten 
competition — and a lot of it. While 
no schedule is set, the expectation 
is to play a conference-only season 
at some point this winter. 

“When the game gets taken 

away from us in a situation like 
this did, it makes you hungrier,” 
associate head coach Bill Muckalt 
said. “I think there seems to be 
a genuine enthusiasm with our 
players to get back on ice.”

The 
coaching 
staff 
has 

emphasized that they’ve been 
focusing on the things they can 
control. That doesn’t just mean 
staying in shape and keeping 
attitudes positive — it’s also about 
testing negative. The captains 
have created protocols to try to 
keep a bubble as much as possible. 
 

“So far they’ve done a great job,” 

Michigan coach Mel Pearson said. 
“I’m really proud of the job that 
they’ve done, and to this point. 

They’ve been excellent.”

At least some semblance of 

normalcy is returning to Yost Ice 
Arena. This week, Michigan will 
go back to a full 20 hours of ice 
time — up from just four hours per 
week allotted by the last round of 
COVID-19 restrictions.

“Obviously with only the four 

hours you gotta select the things 
that you want to do and use all 
your time towards that,” junior 
forward Jimmy Lambert said. 
“We’ll have a little bit more time to 
work on systems, power play and 
other special teams stuff so that’ll 
be a benefit to get ahead of a couple 
other teams in the Big Ten.” 

Trying to practice amid the 

pandemic has been an evolving 
task. When they could get on the 
ice, they were playing in smaller 
groups with masks on. Outside of 
the rink, players prepared for the 
season by lifting in their garage 
and playing roller hockey. 

Michigan is working diligently 

to make up for the ice time they 
missed the past few months. But 
they also must be careful about 
staying safe because otherwise 
they’ll be set back further. 

“You know how important it is 

to do the right thing away from the 
rink, so that we can have a season 
and we don’t have to get shut down 

like you’ve seen in some other 
schools and programs,” Pearson 
said. 

Another 
challenge 
for 
the 

Wolverines is preparing for a 
season when they don’t know the 
start date. The team wants to be 
ready for game action, but not over 
do it too quickly.

“If you know when your start 

date is for your first game (you) 
usually work backwards. You 
know how much time (you have) 
and what you need to work on,” 
Pearson said. “But in this case, 
with not knowing what the start 
date is, it’s become a little more 
demanding and what you need to 
do is try to make sure we’re not 
burning them out here before we 
start.”

It’s difficult, but the team is 

using its imagination to help make 
things work. The players and 
coaching staff are all committed to 
instilling the team culture and also 
holding everyone accountable to 
try and stay healthy. With the team 
being able to hold full practices 
again, there is at least some sense 
of normalcy returning to Yost Ice 
Arena. The next step is getting an 
actual season to prepare for. 

“We just want to get going,” 

Pearson said. “Tell us when and 
where and let’s drop the puck.”

For the Mattins, Michigan’s 

family atmosphere is only fitting

In sports, your team is a family. 
Developing a relationship keeps 

the team together, and the closer 
it is to a family, the better. But the 
Michigan wrestling team is a step 
above the others, featuring three 
pairs of family members — the 
Amines, Corrells and Mattins. 

What has the program done to 

attract so many siblings? For the 
Mattin brothers, it’s the family 
connection. Their commitment to 
wrestling together started a long 
time ago.

“Over time, our relationship 

has definitely changed because 
we used to fist-fight all the time 
when we were training,” redshirt 
junior Drew Mattin said. “Now, 
(Cole) is one of the best partners 
to train with, so it’s come full 
circle.” 

“I 
would 
say 
when 
we 

started off probably up until my 
sophomore year of high school, 
we used to fight about every single 
time 
we 
practiced 
together,” 

sophomore Cole Mattin said. “ … 
Definitely now, we can actually 
learn from each other instead of 
getting into fights every single 
time.”

Drew was already in the 

program for two years, and when 
it was time for Cole’s commitment, 
he knew his brother was going to 

have an influence.

“He really did not have much 

word on my commitment because 
he wanted me to do what I wanted 
to do, not what he wanted me 
to do,” Cole said. “Obviously he 
wanted me there and thought it 
would be great to wrestle with 
him, which is a lot of why I came 
to Michigan, but in the end he did 
tell me he wanted me to come to 
Michigan, but he did not influence 
it much. But I definitely made the 
correct decision.” 

Last season was Cole’s first in 

the program and Drew’s third. 
When Drew decided to redshirt, 
Cole slid into the lineup, and Drew 
gave him pointers throughout 
the season. Cole won 16 of his 29 
matches last year.

“Drew and I are brothers by 

blood, and my teammates are 
basically my brothers, just not 
by blood,” Cole said. “Family is 
a very big influence on our team 
because we have a ton of brothers. 
Actually my brother Zack is a 
(high school) senior coming up 
to the program next year. There’s 
just a lot of things that draw you 
closer to Michigan and seeing like 
the family bond and how everyone 
is super close is just another thing 
that makes you want to go there.”

All teams have a special bond, 

but according to the Mattins, 
there is something about a family 
relationship that just means more 
in their eyes.

JAKE MOZARSKY

For The Daily

ALLISON ENGKVIST/Daily

The Mattin brothers both chose Michigan because of its familial culture.

Can there be a college hockey season?

More than anything, I want 

college hockey to start. But I’m not 
sure it should. 

On The Daily’s hockey beat, 

we cover hockey because we love 
hockey and we want to write 
about hockey. For the last month, 
we’ve covered a team we’ve never 
seen play in person. Nothing 
would make me happier than to 
spend hours at Yost scrambling 
to finish a flash gamer on time, 
transcribing interviews for way 
too long and staying awake until 
ungodly hours of the night putting 
the finishing touches on a story. 

Of course, the fact that I want 

the season to start is justifiably 
irrelevant. If for some reason I 
didn’t want to watch live hockey — 
and would instead prefer to spend 
the rest of the year searching for 
player highlights on YouTube to 
break down — nobody would care. 
They shouldn’t care. I’m not the 
one taking the ice. 

The only opinion that should 

matter is that of the players, 
and they’ve made it clear that 
they 
want 
to 
play. 
They’ve 

demonstrated it by following 
the rules and holding each other 
accountable, 
and 
the 
results 

show they’ve stayed responsible. 

Beyond one positive test from 
when the team initially arrived 
back on campus in July, every 
COVID test — of both players and 
coaches — has come up negative. 

“Our players have done a great 

job taking care of themselves as 
far as that,” assistant coach Bill 
Muckalt said. “I know everybody’s 
negative right now.”

The key to keeping the players 

safe is continuing and expanding 
that testing and contact-tracing. 
For the last few months, players 
have been tested three times a 
week. In accordance with the Big 
Ten’s fall sports reopening plans, 
that will be ramped up to daily 
testing in the coming weeks. 

So, to recap, people want to see 

hockey games, and players want 
to play hockey games. To achieve 
this, the players, coaches and even 
the Big Ten have come up with 
and followed responsible plans of 
action. 

Unfortunately, the rest of us 

have not.

In Ann Arbor, we have failed 

to confront COVID-19 at every 
level. Individual students making 
poor decisions is one thing — 
it’s certainly bad, and students 
choosing to violate public health 
guidelines are selfish and entitled 
— but at least these individual 
failures can, to an extent, be 
contained. The unavoidable issue 

is that we’re nearly seven months 
into the pandemic, and testing 
scarcity is still making getting 
tested difficult for students. Every 
test we give to athletics is one that 
another vulnerable population 
isn’t getting.

It’s especially problematic in 

the context of the University’s 
abysmal 
pandemic 
response. 

Right now, a student can’t get a 
COVID test from the University 
unless they are symptomatic 
or have had direct contact with 
someone diagnosed with COVID. 
According to the University’s 
own COVID-19 dashboard, more 
than half of student positive tests 
in September came from outside 
testing 
sources. 
That 
means 

we’re likely missing a huge chunk 
of positive tests from students 
without access to a car. 

Those who can get tested 

on 
campus 
— 
say, 
through 

the COVID-19 Sampling and 
Tracking 
Program, 
where 
a 

random sample of asymptomatic 
student volunteers are tested each 
week — will still have to wait two 
days for results to process. Fall 
athletes, meanwhile, will receive 
rapid antigen tests every day. 
This isn’t a guarantee that players 
won’t get the virus, it just means 
that when someone does, it’ll be 
easier to keep it from becoming an 
outbreak. 

It’s not a problem that athletes 

are getting these tests; it’s a 
problem that everyone else is not. 

In fairness, the Big Ten, not the 

University, is shouldering the cost 
of these tests for athletes. But does 
that make it any more justifiable 
that tens of thousands of rapid 
tests will be conducted on athletes, 
while local communities may 
not have access to asymptomatic 
testing at all? Even if they’re not 
taking the opportunity for testing 
from the University specifically, 
the 
tests 
are 
coming 
from 

somewhere. 

Let me be clear on this: The 

Michigan hockey team deserves 
to have a season. The players have 
done everything right, and in a just 
situation, they would have a time 
and place already set for their first 
game. 

But nothing about this situation 

is just — for anyone. We have to 
play with the cards we’re dealt, and 
because of our failed pandemic 
response, we’re stuck with off-suit 
nines and tens. We shouldn’t have 
to ration tests seven months into 
the pandemic, but we do. 

And frankly, I’m not sure 

hockey’s worth it.

Blake using national team 

experience to bolster Michigan

At 
18, 
most 
students 
are 

just getting things figured out: 
graduating high school, pondering 
future 
career 
trajectories 
and 

wasting a little too much time on 
social media.

But Hannah Blake isn’t most 

students. At 18, the Michigan 
women’s soccer team forward was 
representing her home nation, New 
Zealand, in the U20 World Cup — for 
the second time in her career.

In 2016, Blake played for New 

Zealand in the Papua New Guinea 
U20 World Cup at just 16. In 2018, 
she again lined up for New Zealand 
in the U20 World Cup in France, 
where her highlight reel included 
an impressive goal from the far 
left corner of the box against the 
Netherlands

“It’s a surreal experience you 

can’t really describe,” Blake said. 
“It’s completely awesome being able 
to represent all the hard work you’ve 
put in.”

Blake is reaping the benefits of 

this hard work in more ways than 
one. Her stellar performances in 
tournaments like these were a 
significant factor in her being offered 
a significant role for Michigan last 
year. As a freshman, Blake started 19 
of the team’s 24 games, scoring two 
goals and assisting three more.

Despite 
these 
impressive 

achievements, 
Blake 
remains 

humble. While she acknowledges 

that scoring in the World Cup was a 
personal achievement of significant 
magnitude, Blake was adamant 
that the disappointment of falling 
to the Netherlands 2-1 in that game 
outweighed the jubilation of scoring 
the goal, as the loss meant that the 
team was set up poorly for the rest of 
the tournament.

For Blake, the feeling of suiting 

up for New Zealand is unparalleled. 
But in her first year at Michigan, she 
experienced something entirely new.

“The amount of passion that 

people in the U.S. have for soccer is 
something that differs a lot,” Blake 
said. “The amount of energy that 
people bring makes it super exciting 
to play at Michigan.”

The more physical style of play in 

the American college game has also 
pushed her boundaries as a player.

“In the U.S., there’s a bigger 

emphasis 
on 
strength 
and 

other athletic attributes,” Blake 
said. “You’re in a high intensity 
environment all the time, which 
was something I had to get used to 
during my freshman year, but that’s 
definitely been a positive for me.”

Blake hopes to use her time at 

Michigan as a scaffold to push on to 
bigger career goals.

“The Women’s World Cup is 

in Australia and New Zealand in 
2023, so I think that’s definitely the 
direction I’d like to work toward. 
Being able to represent your country 
in front of home fans would be 
amazing, and I think my time here at 
Michigan is going to be able to help 
me work toward those goals.”

Club lacrosse rises through pandemic

As the COVID-19 pandemic 

raged through the summer, 
its presence loomed over the 
men’s club lacrosse team’s 
season. 
Members 
worried 

about whether they would 
even be able to practice as 
fall crept ever closer. The 
elimination of intercollegiate 
play 
proved 
a 
foregone 

conclusion.

Then in late August, the 

University allowed the team 
to begin a public health-
informed practice schedule 
at Mitchell Field, a major 
stepping stone in the road 
back to competition.

Like 
many 
Michigan 

club sports, the student-led 
lacrosse team faced a litany 
of uncertainties coming into 
the new year. With safety 
precautions 
impacting 

everything from practices to 
scheduling and recruiting to 
team bonding, the lacrosse 
team was forced to adapt in 
order to enter its ninth season 
in the National Collegiate 
Lacrosse League.

Traditionally, fall means 

weekly practices and some 
intercollegiate play for the 
team to hone its craft for the 
spring season, during which 
the Wolverines compete in 
the NCLL’s midwest division. 
If the team wins its division, 
it finds itself in the national 
Elite 
Eight 
at 
the 
Naval 

Academy in Annapolis, Md. 

However, 
those 
plans 

are up in the air due to the 
ongoing 
pandemic. 
There 

will be no intercollegiate play 
this fall, and the pandemic 
has prevented the planning 
of a schedule for the spring 
season.

In order to stay in game 

shape during the ongoing 

pandemic, the team has been 
practicing once a week to 
work on individual skills and 
team strategy, but the team 
prioritizes 
safety 
during 

practices, especially during 
drills with close contact.

“When 
suiting 
up 
for 

practice on the sidelines, we 
try to be a little more spread 
out than usual,” club lacrosse 
vice 
president 
Harrison 

Gerber 
said. 
“Additionally, 

we highly recommend players 
wear masks whenever we 
huddle up as an entire team 
before and after practice to 
talk. However, during the 
actual drills we do not enforce 
any mask wearing beyond 
personal preference.”

The team also limits the 

number 
of 
athletes 
who 

can attend the practices to 
a maximum of around 30. 
Club lacrosse has historically 
been a student-led endeavor, 
something which its president 
was quick to mention.

“Practices are fully player-

led with members of the 
e-board as well as captains 
usually 
taking 
the 
roles 

of coaches,” club lacrosse 
president 
Andrew 
Poulos 

said. “We pride ourselves 
that 
we 
are 
disciplined 

enough 
to 
run 
practices, 

games and whole seasons 
with oversight over ourselves. 
Everyone collectively knows 
our goals and wants to work 
toward them even without an 
authoritative figure.”

Relationships 
with 

the 
University 
have 
been 

productive, 
according 
to 

Poulos.

“We had to spend most of 

the summer waiting to see 
if we would be allowed to 
use the fields,” Poulos said. 
“But (the University) kept us 
updated on the process when 
we asked and let us know as 
soon as they could.

“We definitely had to be the 

initiator of most conversations 
with the University as they 
did not make formal decisions 
apparent right away, but they 
were good about responding 
and explaining the situation 
when we did ask.”

Club 
sports 
assistant 

director Laurel Hanna and 
program 
manager 
Cybbi 

Barton 
did 
not 
provide 

comment in time for the 
publication of this article.

But while the spring season 

remains 
uncertain, 
Gerber 

hopes some sort of working 
plan can be formulated.

“Longer term, we really 

hope other teams can generate 
some sort of plan to return 
to play so we can have a real 
season this spring,” Gerber 
said. “At this point, it’s pretty 
much out of our hands. We can 
do everything in our power 
to stay game ready, but it’s 
up to the greater NCLL and 
our individual peer schools 
to determine if we can put 
together 
a 
schedule 
this 

spring.”

Poulos believes the spring 

season’s future lies in the 
progress of fighting COVID-
19, especially the development 
of a working vaccine.

“The biggest challenge with 

planning out a spring season 
is the uncertainty of how the 
virus will progress and what 
will be safe in the future 
months,” Poulos said. “We 
hope, along with the rest of the 
country, that COVID won’t be 
an issue by the spring, but we 
know that it is very possible 
that we will still be fighting it.

“It is hard to plan a season 

when we have very little idea 
of what will be safe and what 
will be allowed at that time.”

While many experienced 

players are more than willing 
to adapt to the new landscape 
of sports during the pandemic, 

club lacrosse has found itself 
in a bind when it comes to 
attracting new members this 
fall.

Gerber hopes that the more 

focused recruiting strategy 
during the pandemic will 
mean a higher retention of new 
players into future seasons, 
but Poulos worries about the 
impact of pandemic recruiting 
on the team’s future rosters.

“For the future, the main 

issue is freshman recruiting 
and team cohesion,” Poulos 
said. “With virtual FestiFall 
and 
a 
lack 
of 
in-person 

communication, we have less 
freshmen than usual right 
now. While we still have 
enough players, we always 
like having a good group of 
freshmen that will carry the 
team into future seasons.”

As COVID-19 limits the 

number of safe recreational 
activities, forming a strong 
camaraderie 
among 
team 

members — something usually 
fostered with team hangouts 
and social events — poses a 
difficult challenge for the 
team.

“This season we feel that 

having team hangouts would 
be unsafe and irresponsible. 
However, we still want to 
make sure the community 
aspect is there,” Poulos said. 
“We are trying to figure out 
virtual ways to do this, but 
as most people around the 
country now know, it is much 
harder to make a connection 
with someone virtually.”

Ultimately, 
the 
team’s 

focus lies on preparing for the 
uncertain spring campaign 
through drills and intrasquad 
competition. 

“Overall, we are happy that 

we can still play in a limited 
capacity,” Poulos said, ”and 
we hope we can still establish 
the community that makes me 
love this team.”

With three weeks until opener, 

offensive line hoping to find stability

Offensive line, by nature, is 

a position rooted in contact. So 
this fall, when Michigan had to 
practice without pads until last 
Wednesday, it was perhaps the 
position group hardest hit.

A year ago, the Wolverines 

would have been well equipped 
to handle such adversity. Their 
offensive line was returning 
four starters from a unit that 
had gelled down the stretch in 
a 10-3 season.

This year, not so much. All 

four of those returning starters 
are gone. Even Jalen Mayfield 
— the only returning member 
of last year’s starting five — was 
away from the team training for 
the NFL Draft before reversing 
his decision when the Big Ten 
reinstated its season.

As such, Michigan is left 

with an inexperienced line that 
has never played together at a 
time when continuity is more 
important than ever.

According 
to 
redshirt 

sophomore Ryan Hayes, the 
starting unit as of Sept. 3 
was himself at left tackle; 
either senior Chuck Filiaga 
or redshirt freshman Trevor 
Keegan at left guard; fifth-
year senior Andrew Vastardis 
at 
center; 
redshirt 
junior 

Andrew Stueber at right guard 
and redshirt freshman Karsen 
Barnhart at right tackle. Two 
weeks later, Mayfield’s return 

vaulted him into the starting 
right tackle spot.

“These guys are going into 

their third and fourth years 
in the program,” offensive 
coordinator 
Josh 
Gattis 

said this month, eschewing 
requisite preseason confidence. 
“They’re 
not 
your 
typical 

freshmen or first-year players 
that you’re looking to replace 
a lot of your offensive linemen 
with.”

Still, only Mayfield, Stueber 

and Hayes have started a single 
college game — a daunting 
proposition 
regardless 
of 

preparation time. And now, 
missing 
so 
much 
contact 

practice only adds to the 
uncertainty.

The 
least 
experienced 

members 
— 
like 
Keegan, 

Barnhart, freshman Zak Zinter 
and redshirt freshman Trente 
Jones — haven’t been able to 
catch up to the physicality 
of college football. Even the 
returners 
have 
only 
been 

able to build their chemistry 
in contact-less drills, a far 
cry 
from 
game 
situations, 

where the offensive line will 
be required to protect a new 
starting quarterback from 300-
pound pass rushers.

So without being able to 

build 
up 
the 
Wolverines’ 

physical 
aptitude, 
offensive 

line coach Ed Warinner has 
focused on the mental game 
in hopes that the physical side 
will follow.

“The biggest problem with 

an offensive line is learning on 
the fly,” Stueber said. “You may 
get a base look but then when 
it starts changing, that’s when 
an offensive line can truly fall 
apart.

“If you don’t understand the 

concept of the defense, who 
needs to be blocked, where 
the run is aimed — where the 
aiming point is — then it can 
really fall apart. But now that 
we have the mental aspect of 
the game locked down, when 
the picture changes on the fly, 
we can quickly adapt to that 
and I think that’s a big aspect 
that offensive linemen struggle 
to grasp.”

Still, 
there 
are 
a 
few 

technical pointers Warinner 
has been able to instill in his 
team. Without being able to 
fine-tune his players’ power 
and balance — two skills 
reliant on game-like reps — he’s 
focused on their first few steps, 
eyes and hand placement.

Couple that with the mental 

aspect and Stueber believes 
the Wolverines are uniquely 
prepared 
to 
turn 
pad-less 

practices into success on the 
field.

“I feel like as far as the 

mental side of the O-line, like I 
said, I think we’re pretty much 
there,” Stueber said. “We have 
a whole understanding of the 
offense, a whole understanding 
of how it can change and how 
we can adapt to it. I just think 
the next piece is the physical 
side.”

The Wolverines will enter their season and full-pad practices with an inexperienced offensive line.

Meet Marlin Klein, Michigan’s

unlikely 2022 commit

It doesn’t make much sense that 

Marlin Klein would be here, even 
under normal circumstances. Not 
many talented, athletic Europeans 
drop everything and move to 
America to play American football. 
Fewer get college offers. Fewer still 
deal with a pandemic that upends 
the entire process.

Klein, a high school junior, 

became Michigan’s third class of 
2022 commitment on Sept. 22. The 
announcement drew little fanfare. 
The tight end has three stars to his 
name and no one on the Wolverines’ 
coaching staff has seen him play. 
He got on their radar when his 
coach at Rabun Gap-Nacoochee 
School in Georgia, Joe Sturdivant, 
edited a highlight video to better 
show off his abilities. He wanted 
coaches to see him running.

“Sometimes you get those big 

guys, they don’t see how fast you 
are,” Sturdivant said. “So I just put 
the first one of him catching it and 
taking off and accelerating. Making 
a couple big time catches over the 
shoulder. What I would want to see 
when I was recruiting.”

By the time Michigan tight 

ends 
coach 
Sherrone 
Moore 

reached out, Klein was back at 
home near Cologne, Germany due 
to the pandemic. The two built a 
relationship that culminated in 
the closest thing to a visit currently 
allowed under NCAA rules — Klein 
came up to Ann Arbor and walked 
around campus himself, seeing 
the outside of some buildings and 
getting lunch with tight end Luke 
Schoonmaker and defensive end 
Julius Welschof. Following the 
visit, Klein, who said he speaks 

with Moore two or three times a 
week, committed.

His 
reasoning 
for 
picking 

Michigan, though, goes beyond 
that. When he started watching the 
game, the Wolverines were one of 
the few teams he knew. 

“It was always Michigan, it’s the 

Big House, big stadium,” Klein said. 
“It was kinda like the only team my 
parents really knew about.”

So, here he is.
Klein’s parents have supported 

him in this endeavor, one that — 
as of now — looks like it will pay 
off in a college scholarship. It’s 
only been three years since Klein 
attended his first football practice. 
He had played soccer for eight 
years, usually in goal because of his 
height (he now stands 6-foot-7) and 
quickness, then played basketball 
for two. That opened the door to 
American sports. One day, Klein 
went to his local football club, the 
Cologne Crocodiles, and started 
playing for them.

“I just really spent a lot of 

time getting to know the game of 
football, on my weekend, during 
my free time,” Klein said. “That 
made it a lot easier. It was just so 
different from all the other sports 
I’ve played before, but I really got it 
quickly, I would say, just because I 
really wanted to play football.”

Within a year or two, he was 

the best prospect in his class in all 
of Germany. That drew the eye of 
Bjorn Werner.

Werner, a German-born former 

defensive end for Florida State and 
the Indianapolis Colts from 2013-
15, started an organization called 
Gridiron Imports after his playing 
career ended. The goal is to find 
European talent, get them to high 
school in the U.S. and, hopefully, 
Division I and the NFL. He met 

Klein at a camp in Cologne and sent 
out his tape.

“They really saw talent and all 

the coaches talked to my parents,” 
Klein said. “They just supported 
me because they knew I want to do 
this. And I feel like that’s my future 
and that’s what I want to do for the 
next years.”

By September 2019, he was 

touching down in Georgia. In 
Germany, 
he’d 
taken 
English 

classes, but now he had to learn the 
language fluently and live on his 
own at a boarding school.

“All my friends, my family, 

everything’s 
back 
home 
in 

Germany,” Klein said. “... So it was 
really hard, but I just had to take 
this step, just to get to where I’m at 
right now.”

Four games into his high school 

career, he already had an offer 
from Arizona State. The list grew 
from there, culminating in the 
commitment to Michigan. 

In the two years between now 

and stepping on campus, Klein will 
need to fill out his frame and gain 
blocking ability to match his 6-foot-
7 height.

“I think teams are really 

counting on him to be blocking 
tight end that can separate and 
run 
routes,” 
Sturdivant 
said. 

“Especially 
for 
coach 
(Jim) 

Harbaugh, he’s a 12 personnel, 11 
personnel guy, You gotta be able to 
block.”

Klein is matter of fact about the 

whole process. He went through it 
because he wants to play football 
against 
the 
best 
competition 

possible, he says, and this was the 
way to take it as far as he could. 

“That’s why I came here and 

that’s who I want to play against,” 
Klein said. “So I got used to it. And 
I’ve handled it pretty good, I think.”

A

s I wrapped up a 
Zoom interview with 
Benjamin Becker on 
Friday, it occured to 

me how odd this must all be for 
him. We’d just finished watching a 
36-year-old Andre Agassi in tears 
after Becker 
had beaten 
him at the 
2006 U.S. 
Open, in the 
last match 
of his career. 
Becker, now 
an assistant 
coach for the 
Michigan 
men’s tennis 
team, agreed 
to watch some of the match over 
Zoom and talk about a moment 
that is more defining and more 
significant for his opponent than 
for himself. 

Unless you follow the ATP Tour 

closely, Becker’s name won’t stand 
out. He played professionally for 
12 years, climbing as high as the 
top 40 and winning one title, the 
2009 Ordina Open — a 250-point 
grass court tournament on grass 
held in Rosmalen, a town in the 
Netherlands’ North Brabant prov-
ince. So, since that fateful day in 
2006, Becker has been asked about 
that Agassi match. When you 
end a Hall of Famer’s career, the 
moment can overshadow your own 
accomplishments.

“Sometimes it is annoying that 

you always get kind of, everybody 
looks at this match and always 
talks to you about that match and 
also compares you to that match 
and expects something,” Becker 
said. “... During my career, to be 
honest, it was getting annoying 
because everybody would just talk 
to you about it and it’s all they ask. 
But now afterwards, now I can sit 
down and talk about it a little bit 

more as well and get to enjoy the 
match.”

The match itself, a 7-5, 7-6, 4-6, 

7-5 win for Becker, is more com-
petitive than Agassi describes in 
his book, “Open.” After devoting 
the opening pages to a five-setter 
against Marcos Baghdatis in the 
second round and the physical 
debilitations he was suffering at 
the time, Agassi gives this one just 
a few cursory paragraphs. “Becker 
takes me out in four sets. I can 
feel the tape of the finish line snap 
cleanly across my chest,” Agassi 
writes.

It’s quite a good summary of 

Agassi’s standing as a beloved 
20-year veteran. So imagine 
Becker, an up-and-comer of 25 to 
Agassi’s 36, walking into a packed 
Arthur Ashe Stadium to face one of 
the game’s all time greats in front 
of a crowd that is rooting against 
him. Almost immediately, Becker 
was facing break point at 0-40, 

needing Agassi to make a mistake 
to stay on serve. And somehow, the 
game’s great returner did just that, 
hitting a forehand into the net.

 
“I didn’t play aggressive at all,” 

Becker said. “I was very passive. I 
knew how much, how important 
this is. How much of an impact 
this can have. I feel like once I 
saved the first break point, I kind 
of had confidence I could come 
back in the game, and so this was 
a big opportunity for him that he 
didn’t take advantage at all.”

On-screen, Agassi reacts to the 

miss visibly. “He knew it right 
away,” Becker says. “... He missed 
the big chance.”

The match rolls on to a sec-

ond set tiebreak and Becker has 
already lost a point on serve. He 
goes down 6-4 and nets a fore-
hand.

“You can tell, I wasn’t loose 

enough in my arms,” Becker says. 

He’s vastly overestimating my abil-
ity to glean from a pixelated video. 
“I didn’t go to the ball enough. Just 
moving parallel to the baseline and 
miss it in the net, which is obvious 
that I was a little bit too tight in my 
forearm and too nervous.”

I ask if he can make that diag-

nosis in real time. “Yes,” he says. 
“You feel it.”

There’s something to be said 

here for the level of ability it takes 
to have even a relatively pedestrian 
professional tennis career — this 
fourth round appearance at the 
2006 U.S. Open was his best ever 
at a major and he was never ranked 
higher than 35th in the world. 
That resume is easy to overlook. In 
reality, it takes incredible skill to 
get that far. 

He says his serve was a weak-

ness in juniors, but here it’s a 
weapon. He’s throwing one of 
the great returners of all time 
off his game, winning 13 straight 

points on serve during the first set. 
By the time we get to the fourth 
set, with Becker facing a fifth 
down 5-4, he’s telling me how 
tired he was, cramping up in the 
August sun. On the screen, Agassi 
is hunched over and barely moving 
— he had collapsed walking to his 
car after his second round match 
— and they’re still playing through.

Becker watches his own second 

serve just hit the line. He’s down 
set point. After a few ground-
strokes, Agassi sails a forehand 
out. 

“I got really lucky,” he says. 

“You can see I’m not moving at all. 
... He was kinda surprised by my 
mishit and just doesn’t move to the 
ball at all and just frames it as well. 
I got really lucky on this point for 
sure.”

On screen, it looks like Agassi 

has missed his chance. In the pres-
ent, Becker is talking about how he 
didn’t want to call out the trainer 

for cramps or show weakness. He 
comes back to win the game and 
tie the set at five, then decides to 
go for it. To that point, he’d been 
conserving energy on Agassi’s 
service games, but now he gets 
handed a point to make it 15-0.

 “You have more in you than you 

think,” Becker says, describing his 
mindset. “You can do more. I know 
you’re trying to be a little bit con-
servative if you have energy on his 
service games, but now is the time 
to make a push.”

He wins the game and serves 

out the match. The crowd gives 
Agassi an ovation. The younger 
Becker is shuffled off screen. Now, 
despite recalling exactly how he 
mishit a forehand in the second 
set of this match, Becker doesn’t 
remember this part especially 
well.

“I don’t know what we said 

at the net,” Becker says. “I don’t 
know what happened after. I 
remember the interview, just bare-
ly. I remember they kind of told 
me to leave and go into the tunnel, 
just to kind of give him room for 
his speech and then I came back to 
sign some autographs. I remember 
this part, but it’s all more of a blur.”

Soon after, Becker lost to Andy 

Roddick, an eventual finalist in 
the tournament that year and its 
champion in 2003. A few months 
ago, he watched back the whole 
match for the first time when a 
German TV station asked him 
to participate for Agassi’s 50th 
birthday. He wasn’t irked by the 
request.

“I learned a lot from the match 

to be honest,” he said. “But I enjoy 
(it) way more now than I did dur-
ing my career.”
