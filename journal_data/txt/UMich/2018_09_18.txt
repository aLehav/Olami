COMMUNITY AFFAIRS

Commissioner 
Jessica 
Rosenworcel of the Federal 
Communications Commission 
visited 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan Monday night to 
discuss net neutrality with 
Jack 
Bernard, 
associate 
general 
counsel 
of 
the 
University, to a crowd of 
about 150 students, staff and 
community members at the 
Ford School of Public Policy.
The FCC decided to repeal 
net neutrality rules on Dec. 
14, and the repeal took effect 
June 11. This decision allows 
broadband providers to change 
the 
pricing 
packages 
for 

different users and different 
content. Rosenworcel was one 
of the two dissenters in the 
agency’s decision to repeal 
net neutrality and has since 
been a vocal supporter of the 
protections.
Bernard said a cloud of 
confusion 
often 
surrounds 
net neutrality, so he began 
the policy talk by asking 
Rosenworcel to define the 
term.
“It means that you can 
go where you want and do 
what you want online, and 
your 
broadband 
provider 
does not make decisions for 
you,” Rosenworcel explained. 
“It means your broadband 
provider does not have the

The 
University 
of 
Michigan’s Senate Assembly 
convened Monday afternoon 
for its first meeting of the 
academic 
year. 
The 
group 
discussed a motion to create 
a tri-campus committee for 
the Senate Assembly, as well 
as a resolution to change the 
assembly rules to allow remote 
attendance 
and 
electronic 
voting for representatives.
The meeting opened with 
remarks by Joy Beatty, vice 
chair of the Senate Assembly 
and an associate professor at 
U-M Dearborn, in which Beatty 
explained 
the 
foundational 
principles 
of 
the 
Senate 
Assembly to new members, as 
well as the assembly’s position 
in regard to other governing 
bodies at the University. The 
assembly consists of 74 elected 
faculty members from across 
schools and departments on 
the University of Michigan’s 
three campuses.

University

Michigan 
professor 
John 
Cheney-
Lippold 
is 
facing 
claims 
of 
anti-Semitism 
after 
rescinding his offer to write 
a recommendation letter for 
LSA junior Abigail Ingber, 
who requested the letter for an 
application for a study abroad 
program in Israel.
Cheney-Lippold, who works 
in 
the 
American 
Culture 
Department, 
expressed 
his 
apologies in the email but 
claimed that as part of an 
academic 
boycott 
against 
Israel, he would be unable to 
write a recommendation for 
the student.
Club Z, an organization 
that works to empower and 
network Jewish students who 
are committed to Zionism, 
posted the screenshot of the 
email exchange to Facebook 
Sunday afternoon. The group 
criticized the email, claiming 
the message was anti-Semitic. 
The post also noted the U.S. 
Department 
of 
Education 
recent changes its definition 

of anti-Semitism to include 
situations that hold Israel to a 
double standard in comparison 
to other democratic states.
“As you may know, many 
University departments have 
pledged an academic boycott 
against 
Israel 
in 
support 
of 
Palestinians 
living 
in 
Palestine,” the email read. 
“This boycott includes writing 
letters of recommendation for 
students planning to study 
there.”
This boycott follows last 
year’s controversy regarding 
the #UMDivest movement and 
the 
Central 
Student 
Government resolution that 
called 
for 
the 
University 
to 
investigate 
divestment 
from companies that violate 
Palestinian 
human 
rights. 
The resolution passed last 
November with 23 votes in 
favor, 17 against and five 
abstentions. 
The 
following 
December, 
the 
Board 
of 
Regents 
rejected 
the 
resolution.

The University of Michigan 
Professional Nurses Council 
announced Monday morning 
that 
Michigan 
Medicine 

nurses voted overwhelmingly 
to strike for three days amid 
bargaining efforts. Over 4,000 
nurses voted in favor of a 
strike.
UMPNC 
represents 
more 
than 5,700 registered nurses at 
University Michigan hospitals, 
clinics and other health care 
facilities.
UMPNC 
members 
have 
filed 
unfair 
labor 
practice 
charges against the University 
for failing to bargain in good 
faith, making changes in work 
shift 
without 
notification 
and discrimination against 
free speech. 
In 
a 
press 
release, 
Michigan 
Medicine 
nurse Katie Scott said the 
University created barriers to 
negotiation.
“The 
University 
keeps 
violating our rights,” Scott said. 
“They’ve created a wall that’s 
blocking us from negotiating 
the issues that are important to 
nurses and our patients. We’re 
saying, break down that wall so 
we can bargain in good faith.”
Michigan 
Medicine 
spokeswoman Mary Masson 
wrote 
in 
a 
statement 
to 
The 
Daily 
that 
hospital 
administrators 
were 
disappointed 
to 
hear 
the 
outcome of the vote. Since it 
is illegal for public employees 
to strike, Masson wrote the 
hospital is willing to take legal 
action to avoid one. 
“Nurses are critical 
to the delivery of 
safe 

patient care,” she wrote. “The 
most critically ill patients in 
the state come to Michigan 
Medicine. A strike could put 
patient safety at serious risk.”
The statement goes on to 
clarify how patient care will be 
handled in the event of a work 
stoppage. 
“Since UMPNC announced it 
was seeking the vote, Michigan 
Medicine leaders have been 
developing a comprehensive 
continuity 
of 
operations 
plan in place in the event of a 
strike,” the statement reads. 
“This will include hiring and 
training 
temporary 
nurses 
to replace absent employees, 
deferring 
and 
rescheduling 
select procedures and making 
staff scheduling adjustments 
as needed. Michigan Medicine 
remains committed to patient 
safety 
during 
any 
union 
activity, and will do everything 
possible to maintain the highest 
quality of care during a strike... 
We remain ready to continue 
bargaining with the UMPNC 
and are eager to resolve the 
contract negotiations.”
Katie 
Oppenheim, 
Michigan 
Medicine 
nurse 
and chair of UMPNC, said the 
nurses’ goal is to create a fair 
contract for all of its members. 
“Our goal is not a work 
stoppage,” Oppenheim said. 
“Our goal is a fair agreement 
which respects nurses and 
guarantees safe staffing. The 
University can remedy this 
situation 
immediately, 
by 
stopping their unfair labor 
practices and bargaining in 
good faith.”

FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel discusses net neutrality at a policy 
talk put on by the Ford school Monday afternoon.

Daily Staff Reporter


with Cheney-Lippold’s decision 
not to write the letter, saying 
professors should encourage 
students to explore educational 
opportunities 
without 
the 
influence of personal politics.
“I 
can’t 
speak 
for 
all 
students, but I know that I 
and many others feel hurt by 
this decision,” Coden said. 
“Studying in or visiting Israel 
is an opportunity to immerse 
ourselves in an Israeli culture 
that is different from our own, 
but also a Jewish culture that 
is very familiar and part of our 
own identity. Students should 
not be denied the opportunity 
to experience another culture 
as a result of a professor’s 
political viewpoints.”
University 
Public 
Affairs 
released a statement regarding 
the 
incident, 
reaffirming 
the consistent opposition of 
boycotting Israeli institutions 
of 
higher 
education. 
The 
statement upholds no academic 
department or unit officially 
maintains a boycott.
“It is disappointing that a 
faculty member would allow 
their personal political beliefs 
to limit the support they are 
willing to otherwise provide 
for our students,” the statement 
read. “We will engage our 
faculty 
colleagues 
in 
deep 
discussions to clarify how the 
expression of our shared values 
plays out in support of all 
students.”
Cheney-Lippold 
acknowledged 
his 
mistake 
in 
claiming 
University 

departments 
support 
the 
boycott 
and 
amended 
the 
statement he made in the 
email, saying his support of the 
boycott is a personal stance.
“I 
support 
the 
boycott 
because I support solidarity,” 
he said in an interview with 
The Daily. “I follow the idea 
that people who are being 
discriminated 
against 
or 
people who need help … I 
feel compelled to help them. 
I was following a call by 
representatives of Palestinian 
civil society to boycott Israel in 
a very similar tactical frame as 
South Africa. The idea is that 
I support communities who 
organize themselves and ask 
for international support to 
achieve equal rights, freedom 
and to prevent violations of 
international law.”
Cheney-Lippold affirmed the 
boycott focuses on institutions 
rather than people and stated 
that denying Ingber’s academic 
opportunities should not be in 
question. He confirmed upon 
further contact she did find 
another person to complete the 
letter.
“The perennial claim of anti-
Semitism I fully deny,” Cheney-
Lippold said. “I have no bad 
will against the student, and I 
would have very gladly written 
a letter for any other graduate 
program or study abroad. The 
idea is that I am just one person, 
and by refusing to write that 
letter or at least rescinding it, 
I tried to keep to my conscious 
and to the fact that I believe 
that the boycott is a good tactic 
to enhance human rights and to 
get everyone in Israel-Palestine 
to have what international 
criminal court and the U.N. in 

general has requested, which is 
equal rights for everybody.”
Cheney-Lippold 
also 
said 
he wanted to focus on the 
importance of dialogue within 
the University on this issue as 
well as highlight the student 
organizations on campus who 
are furthering knowledge on 
the issue for the campus and 
upholding diversity of thought.
“As a professor, I’m not 
just a machine writing things 
for people,” he said. “I have 
opinions 
and 
even 
though 
a letter of recommendation 
is about the student, a lot of 
thought goes into them. It’s 
not a blank check where I’m 
signing for them to go to any 
place they want, it is a dialogue. 
It’s 
what 
the 
University 
is 
about, 
talking 
through 
differences and really figuring 
out where each other stands, 
not expecting something or 
assuming something, but really 
trying to get into what is the 
key difference. Seeing what can 
we do more, how can we have a 
larger campus-wide discussion. 
I want to push it beyond the 
horse-race politics of what 
John did or did not say.”
LSA 
junior 
Sophee 
Langerman claimed she fully 
supports 
Cheney-Lippold’s 
decision 
as 
a 
boycott, 
divestment 
and 
sanctions 
activist, but reaffirmed the 
complexity of the issue and 
the diversity of opinion among 
students on campus.
“I believe that this professor 
is 
100 
percent 
correct 
in 
his 
refusal 
of 
writing 
a 
recommendation 
letter 
in 
support of the BDS movement,” 
she said. “A trip to Israeli-
occupied 
Palestine 
would 

mean the support of the mass 
murder 
and 
oppression 
of 
not 
only 
Palestinians, 
but 
Ethiopian 
Jews, 
Mizrahi 
Jews, East-Asian immigrants 
and other non-white minority 
communities. 
BDS 
cannot 
support that. I would also like 
to point out that this professor 
was never under any obligation 
to write this student a letter 
of recommendation, and in 
fact, she got more than most 
students do by receiving a 
reply about why he would not 
participate.”
Langerman 
hopes 
the 
boycott can encourage peaceful 
dialogue 
and 
activism 
for 
students and faculty alike at the 
University.
“As far as I have experienced, 
Jewish 
and 
Palestinian 
communities on campus have 
always had a divide due to the 
rhetoric produced by Zionist 
entities that anything ‘pro-
Palestine’ 
is 
anti-Semitic, 
which is just flat out incorrect,” 
she said. “If anything, I hope 
that this professor’s boycott 
empowers the rest of the 
academic community to take 
a 
stand 
against 
apartheid 
regimes, and brings forth more 
fruitful dialogue surrounding 
the BDS movement – and why 
it is such a crucial form of 
nonviolent activism.”
Ingber told The Michigan 
Daily she is currently unable 
to comment on the incident, as 
she is waiting to discuss it with 
University officials. According 
to Club Z’s Facebook page, they 
did not receive the message 
from Ingber, but rather from 
another University professor to 
whom the email was sent.

Faculty debate reclaiming terms with 
A/PIA dept. in community dialogue

University of Michigan stu-
dents and faculty discussed is-
sues of free speech, derogatory 
terms and minority groups’ 
efforts to reclaim these terms 
Monday night at the Harlan 
Hatcher Graduate Library. 
The Asian/Pacific Islander 
American Studies Department 
and student group WeListen 
hosted the event, which used 
the example of The Slants 
— an Asian-American rock 
band who went to the U.S. 
Supreme Court to trademark 
their name — as a starting 
point for the presentations 
and 
WeListen 
discussion.
Last week, the A/PIA De-
partment invited The Slants 
to campus for a concert and 
a keynote lecture discussing 
their case. The Slants band 
name originated as an attempt 
to reclaim the derogatory term 
for the A/PIA community. 

Their trademark was rejected 
in 2010, but after years of le-
gal battle, the Supreme Court 
ruled the government could not 
deny trademark protection to 
names considered derogatory.
Five University faculty mem-
bers spoke on the topic, in-
cluding a free speech and hate 
speech specialist from the Law 
School and several ethnic stud-
ies professors. John Kuwada, di-
rector of A/PIA studies, said he 
reached out to faculty with di-
verse backgrounds and research 
interests to speak at the event.
“I asked faculty who had 
quite a bit of experience with 
this idea and I tried to cover 
the whole wide range,” Kuwada 
said. “There’s a lot of slurs out 
there. These things are very 
nuanced and very complex.”
Former 
A/PIA 
Director 
Amy Stillman also spoke on 
The Slants case, showcasing a 
quote from lead singer Simon 
Tam about why he chose the 
band name. He wanted to use

be an ambassador for the 
importance 
of 
faculty 
governance,” 
Beatty 
told 
the assembly. “People aren’t 
always aware of what we do, 
so thank you for being here 
and for standing up for faculty 
governance.”
Later, 
the 
assembly 
discussed 
potential 
improvements to their current 
execution of meetings and 
potential 
guests 
to 
invite 
to their future assemblies. 
Members noted a disconnect 
between the administration 
and 
the 
Senate 
Assembly, 
except when the University 
needs the faculty in times of 
crisis.
David 
Potter, 
secretary 
of the Faculty Senate and a 
professor 
at 
U-M 
Ann 
Arbor, cited the instances 
of white nationalist Richard 
Spencer’s efforts to speak on 
the University’s Ann Arbor 
campus 
earlier 
this 
year, 

stressing the importance of 
collaboration 
between 
the 
University 
administration 
and Senate Faculty to unite 
in these instances instead of 
divide.
“I think that the ideal is 
to create a dialogue between 
faculty and the administration 

through these organs of the 
Senate, without waiting for 
a crisis to take place,” Potter 
said. “The University works 
better when they’re actually 

listening to the community.”
The 
meeting 
continued 
with the introductions of two 
resolutions. Sarah Lippert, an 
associate professor at U-M 
Flint, proposed a resolution 
to create a permanent tri-
campus committee within the 
Senate Assembly. Within the 
three campuses, differences 
in interpretations of various 
policy documents and a lack 
of communication between 
each campus present issues 
in terms of relaying accurate 
information to all faculty. 
The committee will serve 
as a central repository for 
all 
policy 
documents 
and 
resources 
across 
campuses 
and standardize explanations 
of 
such 
documents 
to 
prevent 
confusion 
and 
miscommunication within the 
entire University.
As stated in the resolution, 
if 
passed, 
the 
committee 
will aim “to consider points 
of interest... such as those 
that relate to the relationship 
between the three campuses 
or 
policies 
across 
the 

institution.”
“One of the needs that 
the 
tri-campus 
task 
force 
identified was that it would 
be really helpful to have a 
permanent group that people 
could refer to when there are 
interpretation issues,” Lippert 
said. “It would be a committee 
that looks at things relevant to 
faculty across the institution, 
not at local governance below 
that.”
An ad hoc Tri Campus 
Taskforce 
already 
exists 
in 
faculty 
governance 
after the Senate Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 
Affairs 
voted 
to 
reinstate 
the body last fall, hoping 
to improve communication 
between the three campuses. 
In April, members of Flint’s 
Faculty Council penned a 
letter opposing the creation 
of a standing Tri Campus 
taskforce due to a lack of 
clarity on the proposed body’s 
jurisdiction. 
The meeting closed with 
another resolution introduced 
to the assembly, touching 

on current issues regarding 
quorum and the allowance 
of electronic voting during 
Senate Assembly meetings. 
Scott 
Masten, 
rules 
chair 
and professor at the Ross 
School of Business, mentioned 
that since 2004, there have 
only been quorums at three 
Faculty Senate meetings. The 
meetings in which quorum 
was reached occurred only 
during meetings related to 
tenure, course evaluations and 
other issues closely related to 
the faculty. Quorum for the 
Faculty Senate is 100 out of 
the 3,000 total members.
This 
continued 
lack 
of 
participation is partially due 
to the fact that most faculty 
confuses the Faculty Senate 
with the Senate Assembly, 
a 
much 
smaller 
body 
of 
University representatives.
“Most faculty don’t know 
they’re on the Senate,” Masten 
said. “People don’t understand 
that they’re actually Senate 
members.”

take a long time to discompose 
and harm surrounding areas for 
longer periods of time.
Steglitz said a do-not-eat foam 
warning for the Huron River 
would be issued soon.
We’ve 
provided 
some 
communication to council on the 
issue of foam in the river recently, 
and that is something that is going 
to be coming out in the next couple 
days, is there will be a do-not-eat 
the foam amended to the existing 
fish 
advisory 
notifications,” 
Steglitz said.
PFAS 
levels 
in 
Michigan’s 
public drinking water systems 
are not regulated, and while 
there is a federally designated 
“health advisory level” of PFAS 
in drinking water of 70 parts-per-
trillion, it is not an enforceable 
guideline, 
meaning 
there 
is 
no 
court-mandated 
cleanup 
standards cities and governments 
have to follow.
City Council’s meeting also 
included discussions on other 
topics including a proposal for the 
formation of a police oversight 
board, which was debated during 
a work session at City Hall in 
March. Since then, City Council 
has 
fielded 
recommendations 
from 
citizens 
about 
the 
organization and content of the 
board. Members of the citizen task 
force that drafted the proposal 
argued recommendations made 
by Lazarus would undermine the 
oversight board’s independence. 
Councilmember 
Sumi 
Kailasapathy, 
D-Ward 
1, 
said 
she and fellow Councilmembers 

Jack Eaton, D-Ward 4, and Anne 
Bannister, D-Ward 1, would bring 
forward the task force’s proposal 
at the next City Council meeting 
Oct. 1. Kailasapathy said it was 
“what the residents want from 
us.”
“I take it as my duty to put 
forward the ordinance written 
out by the task force,” she said.
City 
Council 
also 
passed 
a 
resolution 
setting 
aside 
$351,670 for a comprehensive 
transportation plan update from 
Sam Schwartz Engineering DPC. 
The plan would ask Sam Schwartz 
Engineering DPC to recommend 
implementation 
methods 
for 
multimodal 
transportation 
systems with the hopes of zero 
fatalities on the road.
Councilmember 
Zachary 
Ackerman, D-Ward 3, supported 
the resolution.
“For those of you have driven 
in Ann Arbor at the rush hours 
may use the term gridlock from 
time to time,” he said. “I actually 
found out that the term gridlock 
was first coined by the consultant 
we’re hiring. He for many years 
was a senior traffic planner for 
the city of New York, bringing a 
lot of traffic congestion solutions 
to 
neighborhoods, 
improving 
quality of life, as well as taking 
an incredibly progressive and 
forward-thinking approach to his 
practice, as to how do we deal with 
pedestrians and cyclists in our 
public right of way to ensure that 
they are safe when surrounded by 
cars.”
Eaton 
voted 
against 
the 
resolution, arguing it was “an 
inappropriate use” of money.
“This is $351,000 we could 
be using for actual pedestrian 
improvements, on street lighting, 
on 
(rapid 
flashing 
beacons), 
signage at some of the roundabouts 
that are poorly marked at best for 
pedestrians,” he said.

RECL AIMING R ACIST NAMES

“Most faculty 
don’t know 
they’re on 
the Senate.
People don’t 
understand that 
they’re actually...
members” 

“Separate from 
the project, 
the university 
is pursuing 
renewable 
energy options” 

ALICE LIU/Daily
LSA professor Matthew Countryman speaks on issues of free speech and hate speech at a panel and discussion session hosted by A/PIA studies and WeListen at Hatcher Graduate Library 
Monday evening. 

legal right to block websites, 
to throttle online services or 
censor online content.”
Rosenworcel 
emphasized 
the importance of the non-
discriminatory protections of 
net neutrality, which ensured 
broadband 
providers 
could 
not treat the traffic on their 
networks differently based on 
source or content. In order to 
illustrate the meaning of non-
discrimination 
protections, 
Rosenworcel 
compared 
old telephone networks to 
internet providers.
“Think 
back 
to 
the 
basic 
telephone 
network,” 
Rosenworcel said. “It is a 
given that if you went to a 
wired phone on a wall, you 
could call whoever you want. 
The telephone company can’t 
decide you can’t call that 
person, nor can they go in 
and edit your conversation. In 
other words, you have a non-
discriminatory right to make 

that phone call — it’s up to 
you.”
To provide insight to the 
other side of the aisle, Bernard 
asked Rosenworcel to provide 
a “steel man” instead of a 
“straw man” argument for her 
opposition.
“We want our broadband 
providers to experiment and 
come up with package plans 
that 
serve 
everyone, 
and 
making revenue from online 
platforms is an important 
part of that mix, or setting 
up services that only allow 
people to reach small portions 
of the internet could create 
more and different packages,” 
Rosenworcel said. “We want 
them to have that freedom to 
experiment.”
Though 
Rosenworcel 
provided the statement, she 
quickly 
added 
she 
could 
refute what she had just said. 
Rosenworcel said her support 
of net neutrality protections 
would be questionable if the 
broadband provider market 
was competitive, but that is 
currently not the case.

“I believe you need less 
oversight 
if 
you 
have 
a 
competitive 
marketplace,” 
Rosenworcel 
said. 
“Competitive 
marketplaces 
are 
themselves 
the 
best 
regulator of activity. But when 
you look at the broadband 
provider 
marketplace, 
according 
to 
the 
FCC’s 
own data, about half of the 
American public does not 
have a choice of broadband 
provider.”
Opponents to net neutrality 
claim the protections hamper 
business 
and 
innovation. 
However, Rosenworcel insists the 
opposite is true. Since broadband 
providers are no longer legally 
obligated to treat their internet 
traffic 
equally, 
Rosenworcel 
said 
small 
businesses 
could 
experience adverse effects.
“They have the right to 
go to any entrepreneur or 
creator that wants to put 
something online, and say, 
‘Hey if you want to reach that 
customer, you have to pay us a 
toll,’” Rosenworcel said.
As an engineer possibly 

interested 
in 
government 
work, 
Business 
and 
Engineering 
sophomore 
Amulya 
Parmar 
found 
Rosenworcel’s 
comments 
on entrepreneurs especially 
important, 
as 
he 
himself 
started a small web-hosting 
business in high school.
“To me this net neutrality 
conversation is important,” 
Parmar said. “It epitomizes 
that I was, even as a high 
school student, able to build 
my own internet company.”
Gloria and Wayne Baker 
attended 
Rosenworcel’s 
policy 
talk 
because 
their 
hometown 
— 
Manchester, 
Michigan — recently voted 
overwhelmingly against an 
initiative to bring broadband 
internet to the community. 
Installing broadband internet 
would have charged residents 
based on how much land 
they own, so people with 
large 
farms 
generally 
did 
not support the initiative. 
The Bakers rely on satellite 
internet 
access, 
which 
is 
typically 
slower 
than 

broadband internet.
“People 
who 
had 
more 
money had access to pay for 
Wi-Fi as much as they wanted, 
and those people who had 
more money also had larger 
land, so they would have been 
charged more for it,” Gloria 
said.
Rosenworcel is known for 
coining the term “homework 
gap,” referring to the lack 
of internet access for many 
low-income 
and 
rural 
students to complete their 
schoolwork. 
Wayne 
said 
other Manchester residents 
suggested simply waiting for 
5G, a faster satellite internet 
service, instead of installing 
broadband internet. However, 
waiting for the upgrade could 
take years.
“The problem with that is 
5G is not tomorrow, it’s years 
and years away,” Wayne said. 
“So in the interim, what can 
people with young families 
do whose kids need to do 
homework and don’t have 
access to good internet speeds 
to do that?”

the word “slant” to present the 
band’s perspective, or slant, on 
life as people of color in the en-
tertainment industry. She reiter-
ated a question Tam brought up 
in his lecture the week before.
“The question he really put 
forward in his concert last 
week is ‘Shouldn’t a commu-
nity really have the right to 
name itself?’” Stillman said. 
The 
panelists’ 
presenta-
tions went beyond The Slants 
case with panelists discussing 
their own areas of specialty. 
Lawrence La Fountain-Stokes, 
an associate professor in the 

American Culture Department 
who specializes in LGBTQ and 
Hispanic 
Caribbean 
studies, 
spoke about examples of re-
claiming derogatory terms such 
as “queer.” Law professor Leon-
ard Niehoff discussed the legal 
complexities of the case. Beth-
any Hughes, an assistant pro-
fessor in the American Culture 
Department who focuses on 
Native American studies, talked 
about the infamous Washing-
ton Redskins football team.
The Redskins, Niehoff noted, 
are an example of a group ben-
efitting from the Supreme Court 
decision and are not reclaiming 
a hate term for empowerment 
purposes. 
Niehoff 
explained 
how other organizations too, 

like the Ku Klux Klan, could po-
tentially use this case to trade-
mark hate speech of their own.
“The 
First 
Amendment 
has a kind of fearful symme-
try to it,” Niehoff said. “What-
ever you get on one side, you 
get on the other side as well.”
Building on this idea, Mat-
thew Countryman, an associate 
professor of American Culture, 
noted how the meaning and 
intent of a disparaging word al-
ters based on which side is us-
ing it, specifically focusing on 
the use of the n-word in white 
and Black communities. He also 
discussed 
further 
complexi-
ties within the Black commu-
nity about whether the n-word 
should be used at all, recalling 

a debate between two great 
African-American thinkers dur-
ing his freshman year of college.
“I have this very distinct 
memory when I was a col-
lege freshman of... the African-
American literary community 
arguing about the word,” Coun-
tryman said. “(We argued) about 
whether or not it was evidence 
of the power of a kind of inter-
nalized self-hatred in the Black 
community or whether it was 
proof of a sense of masculine 
solidarity in those communi-
ties. It’s always a contested 
question, whether or not it’s 
possible to reclaim the word.”
Following the panelists’ pre-
sentations, WeListen split at-
tendees into dialogue groups 

to discuss the issue. LSA senior 
Eli Rachlin, a leader of WeL-
isten, talked about the impor-
tance of The Slants case and 
how he hopes the discussion 
will delve into deeper themes.
“It pertains in a lot of way 
to that Supreme Court case, 
but also in a broader sense 
just the idea of reclaim-
ing 
derogatory 
terms, 
which shows up in many 
situations,” 
Rachlin 
said.
LSA 
freshman 
Zhehao 
Tong said as an international 
student, he has much to learn 
about reclaiming hate terms.

here 
is 
something 
special about walking 
into 
a 
bookstore 
and 
exploring 
the 
collection. 
Though I don’t do 
it purposefully, if 
it is my first time 
there, I tend to 
follow 
a 
similar 
path through the 
store to get myself 
acquainted. 
First, 
I 
float 
toward 
the 
literature 
section and walk 
across the wall from A to Z, 
scouring through the names 
of authors both familiar and 
unknown. 
Then, 
my 
eyes 
wander to the history and 
philosophy sections, where I 
can usually find esoteric titles 
that sometimes hint more at 
the tastes of the bookstore 
employees than the interests of 
their customers.
This 
brick-and-mortar 
meandering is in stark contrast 
to 
the 
clickbait 
world 
of 
the internet. In fact, online 
retailers such as Amazon have 
vastly changed the way we 
consume books. Any product, 
for that matter, is filtered 
through the technology giant’s 
recommendation 
algorithms 
and spit back at the customer 
in the hopes of making a sale. 
What we do not often consider 
is how these algorithms are 
destroying the humanistic side 
of reading and how we share 
books with others.
The basic idea of Amazon’s 
recommendation 
engine 
is 
to predict what consumers 
may want to buy based on 
their previous search history. 
The engine seeks to create 
relationships between “objects” 
— which include users, items 
and products — and makes 
a recommendation based on 
these relationships.
For example, a relationship 
may represent a user adding 
a product to their wish list or 
giving it a five-star rating. The 
recommendation engine then 
uses these raw data to compute 
the similarity between the 
product they had just viewed 
and another product in the same 
category. The final step is to 
integrate the recommendation 
into one of Amazon’s many 
on-site or email platforms. 
Approximately 35 percent of 
Amazon’s revenue is generated 
by advertising tools such as 
the “Recommended for You” or 

“Frequently Bought Together” 
suggestions 
that 
use 
this 
algorithm to add to the average 
value of orders.
As opposed to the 
discovery that occurs 
in a bookstore, the 
Amazon algorithm is 
set up so that you only 
see what the site wants 
you to see. This is 
especially problematic 
in terms of people’s 
reading 
habits 
because you only are 
recommended 
books 
that reinforce your current 
tastes and opinions. We should 
be uncomfortable with the 
idea that a digital extension of 
ourselves, created by website 
algorithms for financial gain, 
has so much sway in how we 
think. Blurred lines now exist 
between 
our 
own 
original 
thoughts about what we might 
like and what an algorithm 
decides for us.

In many ways, the digital 
identity 
we 
simultaneously 
create 
for 
ourselves 
and 
that companies create for us 
is the same person. At the 
Code Conference 2016 — an 
invitation-only 
conference 
hosted 
by 
the 
technology 
news website Recode — the 
controversial 
entrepreneur 
Elon 
Musk 
suggested 
that 
humans in the modern age 
are 
already 
cyborgs 
who 
possess 
a 
“digital 
layer” 
above the naturally occurring 
limbic system or cortex. The 
common tropes of implanted 
chips and robotic arms pale 
in comparison to the reality 
that your smartphone holds 
the same computing power 
as the NASA computers that 
guided astronauts to the moon 
in 1969. Each person must 
decide for themselves if this 
powerful digital layer serves a 
symbiotic role or one that has 
the potential to pollute their 

independent, natural selves. It 
is also necessary to question 
who actually has control over 
this digital layer: the user or 
the corporation?
What 
algorithms 
take 
away from the modern reading 
experience 
is 
its 
crucial 
interpersonal dimensions. My 
grandfather, who has lived in 
South Africa since the 1970s, 
told me once on a hike in the 
mountains above Cape Town 
about a book titled “Cry, the 
Beloved Country” written in 
1948 by Alan Paton. The novel 
details the desperate journey 
of a village reverend from the 
countryside of South Africa 
who goes to Johannesburg to 
find his son, only to discover 
that he is charged and convicted 
for the murder of a prominent 
white man and advocate for 
racial justice. The story is 
masterful and nuanced in its 
treatment of race relations and 
reconciliation in the country, 
yet after I finished the novel, 
what I remember most are 
the 
conversations 
with 
my 
grandfather afterward about 
how it impacted him many 
years ago. I definitely would not 
have found “Cry, the Beloved 
Country” relying on Amazon’s 
online book recommendations, 
and more importantly, I would 
not 
have 
had 
this 
shared 
reading 
experience 
that 
brought my grandfather and me 
closer together.
The next time you find 
yourself in a bookstore, take 
the opportunity to slow down 
and see what’s there. If you 
are feeling really brave, you 
can ask an employee for a 
recommendation. I guarantee 
their reasoning process will not 
be based a detailed personal 
history of “likes” or “dwell 
times” (the amount of time you 
spend on a webpage before you 
click on a different item), and 
unlike an algorithm, they have 
most likely read the words on 
the pages they are about to 
endorse. Better yet, exchange 
books with a friend for free and 
pay attention to the meaningful 
conversations 
that 
follow. 
Books have a unique way of 
bringing people together that 
cannot be replicated by social 
media or technology. You only 
have to step back from your 
digital identity to see it.

Your mom is cool
T

he other day, I was 
confronted 
with 
a 
shocking 
experience 
while 
working a greeter 
shift at the Mary 
Markley Residence 
Hall dining hall. It 
was the final day of 
new student move-
in, and a mother 
and her son came to 
the front door of the 
dining hall. The son 
stopped and turned 
to his mother, who 
then asked if she could come 
in and sit with him for lunch 
before she left. In a tone of pure 
annoyance and embarrassment, 
he responded with a cold, “No, 
maybe next time,” which his 
mother begrudgingly tried to 
understand. She gave him a hug, 
which he accepted with an equal 
amount of cold embarrassment 
before leaving her behind to 
enter the dining hall. Bless this 
poor woman’s heart for being 
so understanding, because all I 
could think about was the seven 
levels of “Oh, you want to see 
embarrassing” that my mother 
surely would have verbally 
whipped me with if I had ever 
been so rude to her after she 
spent her whole day helping me 
get settled into college.
So, suffice to say, at this 
point, I simply couldn’t help 
myself. As I took his Mcard to 
swipe it, I told him, “Your mom 
is cool. You should have let her 
eat with you.” His face turned 
a cool shade red before he said, 
yet again, “Maybe next time.”
For some reason, I can’t 
get this sad encounter out of 
my mind. I mean, I remember 
what it was like to be young and 

“too cool” for my parents but as 
my years as a college student 
have 
waned 
on, 
I 
have learned a very 
important 
lesson: 
My mom is definitely 
cool. You know why? 
Because 
one 
thing 
that is most definitely 
not cool is turning a 
whole load of laundry 
blue and ruining half 
of your wardrobe. It 
is also not cool to have 
to have a friend spot 
you grocery money 
when your bank account is 
overdrawn because you don’t 
know how to manage a budget.
Oh and also, my dad is cool. 
This one was a little harder 
for me to swallow personally, 
because in the most redneck, 
Budweiser T-shirt with camo 
boots way possible, my dad 
is not “cool” by Ann Arborite 
standards — But guess what? 
It is not cool to sit outside 
of Meijer with frozen tears 
streaming down your cheeks 
because you left a light on in 
your car and have no clue how 
to use jumper cables. It is also 
not cool to have a picture of 
your favorite football player 
ripped out of the wall and glass 
shatter 
everywhere 
because 
you didn’t know what a “stud” 
was.
The truth is that those of 
us with parents who invest in 
our education, help us get into 
a good school, give us every 
cent they can offer in order to 
see us succeed here and then, 
to top it all off, offer to sweat 
their butts off on a 90-degree, 
humid day to help us move into 
college, should be nothing but 
grateful because, sadly, that 

is not the reality for so many 
kids here in the United States. 
I don’t care if your mom rocks 
Crocs and gauchos or if your 
dad wears an “I’m With Stupid” 
T-shirt to drop you off. The 
fact that you have a parent 
around to embarrass you at all 
is an immense blessing that you 
should not — for one second — 
take for granted.
That’s 
not 
to 
say 
that 
everyone 
has 
the 
best 
relationship with their parents, 
I’m just pointing out that there 
are nearly 450,000 kids in the 
foster care system on any given 
day in the U.S. and, according 
to some of the most recent 
studies, fewer than 10 percent 
of them will attend college. 
If you’ve grown up in a stable 
home in a decent economic 
bracket, you have an incredible 
advantage that so many youth 
today don’t have. 
So, next time your mom or 
dad calls, pick up the phone. 
Thank them for supporting 
you throughout your life. So 
many parents worry endlessly 
about their children who are 
at college. It may seem over the 
top to you, but they’ve spent 
the last 18 years investing most 
of their lives into making sure 
you have the opportunity to 
succeed at an institution such 
as the University of Michigan 
and they would do anything 
to make sure that is a reality. 
Don’t let their investment go to 
waste and remember that even 
on her dorkiest day, your mom 
is still cool!

E

ach 
week, 
University 
of Michigan Business 
students enrolled in the 
class Business and 
Leaders: The Positive 
Differences 
are 
required to attend 
an evening event to 
learn from visiting 
industry 
leaders 
and 
experts. 
Last 
Wednesday, students 
congregated in the 
Hill Auditorium to 
see 
Neri 
Oxman’s 
lecture, “The Krebs 
Cycle of Creativity.” Oxman 
is an architect, designer and 
associate 
professor 
at 
the 
Massachusetts 
Institute 
of 
Technology. Her work has been 
showcased at world-renowned 
institutions 
such 
as 
the 
Museum of Modern Art and the 
Smithsonian Design Museum.
As I waited for the lecture to 
start, looking at the stage where 
three big screens had been set 
up with moving black and white 
images, I wasn’t sure what to 
expect. Her photo, which had 
been posted around the Ross 
School of Business along with 
the lecture details, cut her as 
an intimidating figure — her 
makeup perfectly applied and 
her hair styled in that masterful 
“I didn’t try but it still looks 
great” kind of way I myself have 
never been able to accomplish. 
She smolders at the camera in 
a way that exudes confidence. I 
was expecting her to be like all 
the other speakers that business 
school people love: suave and 
charming, with enough humor 
to offset any possible criticism 
about being too dry.
However, when she walked 
on stage after an enthusiastic 
introduction by Business School 
Dean Scott DeRue, she was so 
unlike the image I had painted 
in my head that I had a hard 
time reconciling the Oxman I 
had seen in the posters with 
the woman on stage. She spoke 
to the audience like she was 
entertaining 
old 
friends 
in 
her living room rather than 
giving a lecture to thousands of 
strangers (many of whom were 
probably snobby intellectuals), 
and her warmth was clearly 
visible when she affectionately 
acknowledged the students who 
had attended her Q&A session 
earlier in the day.
The lecture was fascinating. 
She spoke about the work she 

does at the MIT Media Lab and 
introduced a process she calls 
the Krebs Cycle of creativity. 
She 
explained 
how 
she 
and 
her 
students 
combine 
biology, 
fashion, 
architecture, 
design 
and more in order to 
spawn fantastic and 
almost otherworldly 
creations 
based 
in 
both the real world 
and the imagination. 
She 
spoke 
of 
the 
importance of using 
the word “and” rather than 
“or” — of realizing instead of 
arguing about what discipline or 
invention is more important than 
the other, it’s more productive to 
engage with both and recognize 
the 
contributions 
that 
each 
brings to the world. Oxman 
also spoke about some of the 
many projects she’s worked on, 
including creating a structure 
for 6,500 silkworms to use as 
a base for their silk production 
and putting half a million bees 
into an artificial urban habitat.

Despite the obvious genius 
that exuded from her and her 
passion for difficult, intricate 
work, 
Oxman 
maintained 
the same level of humor and 
relatability 
with 
which 
she 
started the lecture off as she 
delved deeper into the intricacies 
of her work. She told everyone to 
not use their phones or laptops, 
laughingly saying, “It pisses 
me off.” She asked questions of 
the audience, teasing them like 
she would a close friend when 
no one knew the answer (“This 
is rudimentary information!”). 
While she did have carefully 
prepared slides, she made it clear 
she had no intention of following 
any strict plan and simply let 
her 
enthusiasm 
direct 
her 
path. During the Q&A session 
that followed her lecture, she 
sat down on the stage with 
crisscrossed legs and listened 

intently to the questions that 
audience members asked. And, 
her parting words to an audience 
filled with Business students 
when asked how students can be 
like her and produce powerful, 
creative 
work? 
“Don’t 
do 
budgets.”
Oxman’s 
lecture 
was 
profoundly organic and intimate 
in the best way possible — 
though I know that some of my 
peers, who are used to buttoned-
down men giving lectures (while 
throwing 
in 
the 
occasional 
obligatory joke, of course) were 
taken aback by her eccentricity. 
The almost uncomfortably casual 
way in which she presented her 
lecture was a direct contrast 
to the perfect image of being 
professional but affable that so 
many professors believe they 
have to exude when they present. 
Oxman 
was 
unapologetically 
unpolished. She stuttered and 
punctuated her statements with 
laughs and “ums” and “uhs,” 
and she paced and waved her 
hands around in a way that 
some would probably criticize 
as being too distracting. All of 
this only added to her charisma 
and charm; her behavior showed 
she doesn’t care about proper 
presentation decorum and her 
paramount focus was to show 
off her work on her own terms. 
This kind of candor made her 
lecture much more effective 
than any carefully timed jokes 
and seamless transition between 
slides.
To be completely honest, I 
didn’t understand much of what 
she spoke about, and I know that 
was the case for many people 
in her audience. Despite this, 
I found what I did understand 
incredible, and as I left, I was 
struck by how, for perhaps 
the first time ever, I actually 
enjoyed a science lecture. It was 
amazing to see an obviously 
brilliant, 
incredibly 
talented 
woman toss away the stuffy 
presentation guidelines set by 
professionals who believe they 
have to always present the best 
version of themselves in order 
to appeal to their audience. And 
while it’s true that appearance 
means everything in some cases, 
I prefer Oxman’s wonderfully 
disjointed 
and 
invigorating 
method of lecturing.

I always assumed that I 

would get married someday. 
Until 
recently, 
I 
never 

questioned 
my 
reasons 
for 

assuming it; marriage seemed 
like an inevitable stepping stone 
between birth and death, like 
something that happens to a 
person rather than something a 
person does. It wasn’t until my 
brother’s wedding that I realized 
the terrifying enormity of this 
thing that, up until that point, I 
thought everyone stumbled into 
one way or another. Watching 
someone I loved, someone who 
in my mind was still only about 
17 years old, commit the rest 
of his life to another person, I 
was forced to reckon with how 
poorly the love stories of my 
childhood prepared me for the 
realities of marriage. Beyond the 
fairy tale, beyond the wedding, 
my media education had left me 
pathetically in the dark.

It’s 
no 
surprise 
when 

you realize how heavily the 
“marriage plot” figures into 
our 
pop 
culture 
narratives, 

especially 
those 
targeted 

towards young women. The 
marriage plot is at the core of 
virtually any romantic comedy: 
boy meets girl, boy and girl 
circle around each other for 
the better part of the story, boy 
and girl overcome all obstacles 
and realize they’re meant to be 
together forever. The defining 
feature of the genre is that the 
story ends in a wedding (more 
traditionally) or some other 
kind of presumably permanent 
coupling for the protagonists. 

Once you become aware of the 
marriage plot, it’s difficult to 
unsee it. Think of every Disney 
movie you watched as a kid, 
every rom-com and sit-com 
you’ve seen in the past year and 
virtually anything starring Meg 
Ryan. The marriage plot is one 
of the few basic formulas by 
which we know how to consume 
and 
understand 
narratives 

about women. And, like any 
formula that distills a wide 
range of human experiences 
into a narrow set of possibilities, 
it fails to tell the whole story.

One reason the marriage plot 

fails to accurately or insightfully 
represent real relationships is 
that it is, quite literally, archaic. 
The genre was encoded in 
Shakespeare’s comedies, which 
were defined less by humor 
than by their wedding finales, 
and then popularized in the 
19th century novels of Jane 
Austen. But there’s a significant 
disconnect 
between 
what 

marriage meant for women in 
a pre-feminist age and what it 
means now. For Shakespeare, 
Austen and their respective 
contemporaries, 
marriage 

was essentially an economic 
contract between the groom and 
the bride’s father. The bride’s 
consent was largely irrelevant 
and, whether or not there was 
any real love involved in the 
match, her position relative to 
her new husband was servile at 
best. I was always struck by how 
much less interesting I found the 
heroines of these stories after 
their weddings; take Beatrice, 
the heroine of Shakespeare’s 
“Much Ado About Nothing,” 
who, despite being one of the 
more opinionated and spunky 

women of English literature, 
ceases to have any lines at all 
after her wedding. She is literally 
silenced 
by 
marriage, 
her 

identity completely obfuscated 
by that of her husband.

What’s more, the marriage 

plot 
and 
its 
prevalence 
in 

female-centric 
narratives 

suggests that marriage — or 
more accurately, a wedding — is 
the most significant event of a 
woman’s life. In Shakespeare’s 
or Austen’s time, this might have 
been true; women were denied 
entry into most professions, 
couldn’t own or inherit property, 
and had virtually no economic 
or reproductive rights, making 
marriage the climax of their 
lives even though they had very 
little say in the matter. These 
stories end in weddings because, 
beyond that point, the woman 
more or less ceases to exist with 
any degree of independence. 
So why is it that the marriage 
plot is still the most popular 
template for romance today, 
when by all accounts we should 
know better?

I’ll 
admit 
that 
I’m 
as 

susceptible to a good romantic 
comedy as the next person — 
so susceptible, in fact, that 
I’ve been under the spell of the 
marriage plot for a long time 
without even knowing it. The 
media available to me as a child 
and teenager taught me that 
romantic love was the most 
important pursuit of my life. But 
the key word here is “pursuit.” I 
was supposed to pursue love, or 
more accurately to be pursued 
as a passive object of someone 
else’s love, and then the most 
interesting part of my life would 
be over, the rest of my story left 

to vague conjectures of “happily 
ever after.” On the screen, or in 
the pages of the book, that kind of 
narrative offers a rush, but when 
I stopped to imagine it applying 
to my own life, it became deeply 
unsatisfying. I doubt that the 
media directed at young men 
contains the same message. 
Their narratives have problems 
of their own — the glorification 
of mindless violence, enforced 
heterosexuality and emotional 
constipation to name a few — but 
they also tend to be stories about 
taking action and fighting in the 
pursuit of an ideal rather than 
passively waiting to be chosen. 
Romance, if it shows up at all, is 
secondary to or conflated with 
sex.

This isn’t a hopeless case. 

As much as the marriage plot 
continues 
to 
dominate 
the 

popular 
imagination 
around 

romance, we’ve already begun 
to see a shift in the focus of 
women’s 
narratives 
in 
the 

media; “Lady Bird,” “Big Little 
Lies,” “Moana” and “Hidden 
Figures” are only a few recent 
examples of stories that are 
more interested in the ambitions 
and 
platonic 
relationships 

of their protagonists than in 
their marriage prospects. The 
marriage plot also faces an 
interesting challenge from the 
increasing 
representation 
of 

non-heterosexual 
romances. 

While some gay love stories 
have 
erred 
towards 
the 

ostentatiously 
tragic 
(see 

“Brokeback 
Mountain”) 
and 

others conform to marriage-
plot conventions in an effort 
to normalize non-heterosexual 
experiences 
(see 
“Love, 

Simon”), these narratives are 
inherently less tied down by 
the limitations and ingrained 
inequalities 
of 
heterosexual 

marriage, and therefore open 
up a third possibility for the 
portrayal of romantic love: as 
one event in the complex web 
of factors that make a person 
who they are, rather than the 
sole defining aspect of their 
life. I hope that the generation 
after mine takes their cues from 
these stories, and doesn’t make 
the mistake of sitting around 
waiting 
to 
be 
chosen 
just 

because John Hughes and Walt 
Disney told them to.

Women’s stories and foiling the tired marriage plot

BOOKS NOTEBOOK

After eight months of release 

push-backs and a screening 
at the Toronto International 
Film Festival last week, Yann 
Demage’s “White Boy Rick” 
has arrived, only to, sadly, not 
live up to the expectations set 
by 
its 
(pretty 
outstanding) 

trailer. I couldn’t help but put 

“Rick” beside “Boyhood” in my 
mind, as both features are led 
by young, inexperienced actors 
who struggle to carry the weight 
of the film on their shoulders. In 
the case of the latter, directed 
by Richard Linklater, the father 
figure is given enough room 
in the script to pull the film 
back and bring it into an even-
better-than-just-redeeming 
place. Matthew McConaughey, 
the father figure in “Rick,” isn’t 
able to fill those same shoes, his 
relatively minor role in the film 
not giving him nearly enough 
time to rise it out of the ashes. 
Now, of course the two roles are 

different, but there is something 
to be said about hiding your 
headliner too much behind the 
rook.

“Rick” doesn’t try to do 

enough for the audience. It’s not 
heartwarming, it’s not especially 
active, it doesn’t provide for 
many gut-busting lines — the 
film just sort of plays, sitting on 
your palette but lacking flavor. 
Some of this can be attributed 
to the strange, push-and-pull 
relationship 
the 
protagonist 

Richard Wershe Jr. (Ritchie 
Merritt, newcomer) has with 
his father, Richard Sr. (Matthew 
McConaughey, 
“Interstellar”). 

McConaughey’s character is a 
deadbeat from the drop-of-the-
puck, his “lion’s pride” attitude 
not materializing into anything 
that might stave off poverty and 
self-destruction for his family. 
By the end, after young Rick has 
gone through multiple fazes of 
FBI informant, to gun trafficker, 
to drug trafficker, back to FBI 
informant, we are supposed to 
see the Junior’s misguided ways 
as some glaring fault of the father 
— even though McConaughey 
had been trying to hold his son 
back from getting in too deep 
the entire time. The film makes 
it hard to get into young Rick’s 
head, 
making 
his 
eventual 

life-sentence outcome hard to 
attribute to anyone but him. 

Sure, his dad could have moved 
out of Detroit instead of trying 
to stay and turn things around 
— but no one forced young Rick 
to get in too deep, eventually 
so deep that he can’t get out. 

There’s not enough consistency 

in 
theme 
surrounding 
the 

prodigious crack dealer. Had 
the film taken a firm stance on 
the morality of Rick Junior’s 
actions — possibly portrayed 
him as more of an anti-hero 
than a lamb to the slaughter — it 
would have been easier to access 
the emotions of the character for 
both the audience and for the 
actor himself.

“White Boy Rick” lacks a 

defining 
texture 
throughout. 

The sound design and score 
never hit quite right. There 
are lapses in the story where, 
from 
one 
moment 
to 
the 

next, it doesn’t feel like the 
narrative is approaching any 
final destination. Many have 
already touted McConaughey’s 
performance, 
which 
was 

standout amongst the rest of the 
unaffecting acting suite, but it 
even feels that he at times isn’t 
sure what type of movie he’s 
in. For how fun and interesting 
the 
preview 
material 
made 

“White Boy Rick” look, it doesn’t 
manifest in the final product. 
Score one, LBI Productions 
marketing team, I guess.

‘White Boy Rick’ doesn’t 
live up to expectations

FILM REVIEW

Fred Armisen (“Big Mouth”) 

and Maya Rudolph (“Big Mouth”) 
are probably the single most 
prolific duo one could dream 
up in the world of TV comedy. 
Along with Alan Yang of “Parks 
and Recreation” and “Master 
of None” fame, they team up 
wonderfully in “Forever,” a short, 

easy Amazon series that tackles 
some familiar themes with a 
surreal touch.

The 
show 
launches 
into 

the 
exposition 
of 
Oscar 

(Armisen) and June’s (Rudolph) 
relationship immediately, telling 
the story of their entire lives 
together in the space of a short 
montage 
minimally 
backed 

by Miles Davis’s “It Never 
Entered My Mind.” Rudolph 
and Armisen’s vast experience 
in stage and sketch comedy is in 
full display, with their expressive 
facial and bodily expressions 
(as well as Armisen’s trademark 
awkwardness) replacing the need 

for any other forms of dialogue. 
Their 
story 
is 
a 
well-worn 

one (albeit told in the space of 
roughly five minutes). After years 
of marriage, the pair finds their 
relationship stale and detached, 
without the spark of young love.

Despite 
the 
façade 
of 

contentedness with the state of 
their lives, their relationship has 
deeper problems, which June 
takes an admirable first step 
in repairing by suggesting the 
couple refrain from their annual 
fishing trip to go skiing instead. 
And then Oscar dies. Thankfully, 
the show takes only an episode 
to show how June grieves before 
she, too, kicks the bucket and 
joins her husband in the afterlife.

From this point, the show 

seems 
to 
take 
a 
familiar 

direction, focusing once again on 
the relationship between Oscar 
and June, except now in the 
afterlife. The afterlife depicted 
here is slightly less whimsical 
than “The Good Place” (in which 
Rudolph stars as well), but still 
provides a cast of memorable 
and hilarious side characters, 
including a young man who died 
in the 1970s and still uses terms 
like “orientals.”

Unfortunately, it is difficult to 

fully understand why the story is 
set in this world in the first place. 
The same issues that seem to be 
explored could just have easily 

been examined in the real world, 
and the situation makes the 
first two episodes — especially 
the second — feel superfluous. 
For the most part, the afterlife 
is exactly the same as the real 
world, despite a few quirks. It 
feels more like the backdrop of 
a surreal “Portlandia” sketch 
rather than a fully thought out 
one fit for a longer, multi-episode 
series.

Nonetheless, “Forever” makes 

for short, yet still worthwhile, 
viewing due to the overabundant 
comedic 
talent 
of 
Armisen 

and 
Rudolph. 
Somehow, 

anything these two actors do 
can somehow turn out funny. 
While Armisen’s character is 
much of what we expect from 
him, he and Rudolph maintain 
incredible chemistry, and their 
witty dialogue and interactions 
are constantly entertaining. The 
pair also exhibit moments of 
skillful dramatic acting as well, 
making the explorations of the 
progression of romantic love 
more effective.

“Forever” 
does 
not 
do 

anything groundbreaking and is 
certainly not the strongest work 
of its stars. However, at eight 
short episodes in length, it is a 
bingeable, entertaining watch for 
fans of the style of comedy that 
Rudolph and Armisen execute so 
effortlessly.

‘Forever’ is only worth 
watching for the talent

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

Release Date: Tuesday, September 18, 2018

When I die I am going to 

ensure that my last meal is filled 
with all of the wheat, barley, 
spelt, kamut and rye I can stuff 
inside my mouth. I want my 
small intestine to shrivel up and 
go with me — its weaknesses no 
longer my problem — my body, 
laid to rest filled with all of the 
things that have been its poison 
for my whole life.

I will instruct the nurses and 

doctors to bring over plates of 
tall chocolate cake piled high 
with layers of rich icing resting 
between its moist, fluffy sponge. 
I will start with the cake, 
moving on to a bowl of pasta 
next, spirals of noodles filling 
a glass bowl that reflects my 
chubby, round profile as I march 
down the high road to my own 
demise. I will ask for a package 
of Oreos, a package of those pink 
frosted cookies that are so sweet 
they hurt your jaw and a still-
warm plate of my grandmother’s 
brownies. I will move on to a 
tray of croissants and muffins, 
drizzled with percisise ribbons 
of Nutella and sparkling with 
gems of round blueberries and 
chocolate chips. I will have a 
bagel imported from the shop 
in New Jersey — everything 
and undressed, naked in its 
doughy, 
carbohydrate-filled 

glory. I will have a Corona with 
lime, a stack of pancakes, a plate 
of fried chicken and a plate of 
mozzarella sticks. I will dip 
crispy, white-hot egg rolls into 
a bowl of gleaming soy sauce. I 
will finish with a chipwich — the 
kind from the ice cream trucks 
and a peanut butter and jelly 
sandwich. Because when I was 
little, before I was diagnosed 
with celiac, before I even knew 
what it was, those were my 
favorites.

Little did I know then, I was 

poisoning 
my 
eight-year-old 

insides, bite by bite.

Three million people, about 

one percent of the population, 
live with celiac in the United 
States of America. The disease 
is, by definition, an immune 
reaction to gluten, a protein 
found in wheat, rye and barley. 
In response to the consumption 
of the protein, the body is 
triggered to begin an immune 
response 
that 
attacks 
the 

small intestine. This affects 
nutrient absorption in the body 
and makes most people with 
celiac really freaking bloated 
and causes a whole bunch of 
other complications I’ll let you 
imagine for yourself.

Basically, my body has not 

made a hospitable environment 
for pizza, pasta, cookies, bread 
and happiness. I’m Italian, from 
a family of restaurateurs and 
chefs and I can’t eat pasta or 
pizza without being in agony, 
clutching 
my 
stomach 
and 

wondering where my genes went 

wrong. Everything I feel my 
culture and heritage is founded 
on — sharing meals, sharing 
bread — is a problem. Each pizza 
crust dipped in olive oil is like my 
own personal cyanide. I wonder 
if my grandfather is rolling over 
in his grave, wishing to disown 
me for my inability to ingest our 
Italian holy grail: pasta.

In a modern world, having 

celiac disease is getting easier 
every single day. Restaurants 
and grocery stores are keen on 
promoting gluten free products, 
which trendy moms who are 
testing out a gluten free diet 
and patrons who think they’re 
being healthy would consider 
“actually 
edible.” 
But 
the 

problem, for me at least, isn’t 
the lack of options or navigating 
restaurant menus, but rather the 
social awkwardness and stigma 
that comes along with being 
“gluten free.”

No matter how many times 

I can stress that I am not 
“gluten free,” but rather have a 
diagnosed disease that makes 
my body strongly irritated by 
gluten products and will lead 
to the destruction of my small 
intestines if I do not avoid it, 
I’m still that gluten free girl. It 
makes me feel like a burden or an 
annoyance — always being the 
one creating the problems when 
a group of people is ordering 
out, or when someone wants to 
share something. Being asked 
“Oh ... you’re gluten free?” in 
that monotone and judgemental 
drawl makes me want to scream, 
but normally I just respond, 
“actually, I have celiac,” and 
the conversation ends there, the 
person on the other end blinking 
in strange disbelief and biting 
into their quesadilla.

The awkward situations that 

come up are almost constant. 
Thinking about how food is 
pretty much the main form of 
American 
socialization, 
one 

can imagine how the celiac 
community runs into quite a few 
fumbles. Being offered a bite of 
someone’s food — a taste of cookie 
dough ice cream, a salad dotted 
with croutons, a dumpling, a 
slice of thick pumpkin bread 
— all accompanied by the “I’m 
allergic” 
comment 
will 
end 

a 
conversation 
every 
time. 

Birthdays and office gatherings 
when everyone wonders why 
you’re avoiding the cupcakes like 
the plague and proceeds to offer 
you them multiple times when 
in reality you simply can’t have 
them. Tailgates where people 
hand you beers, dates where you 
scan the menu for something not 
weird but also allergen friendly 
that won’t bring up the gluten-
free thing right away and the 
“let’s order pizza!” comment 
with the realization that you’ll 
be skipping out on dinner — all 
accompanied with the awkward 
pity 
coming 
from 
everyone 

around you.

I don’t want anyone to feel 

bad for me. I don’t want anyone 

to think I’m doing this to be on 
some trendy diet, or because 
I want to drop 10 pounds fast 
(which, 
by 
the 
way, 
going 

gluten free doesn’t do). In fact, 
I’ve really grown into what it 
means to be affected by celiac, 
and how I can make positive 
changes to enjoy the world of 
food without gazing, sardonic, 
on the other side of a bakery 
display, my head bubbling with 
dreams of round profiteroles 
and strawberry eclairs. Instead 
of just the gluten free flour 
options, I reach for interesting 
substitutes, 
expanding 
my 

palate and knowledge on food 
— and cooking tremendously for 
someone who has to try different 
approaches.

Before being diagnosed, I was 

always eager to choose going 
out to eat over cooking in, but 
now that it is easier to cook for 
myself to ensure I’m not eating 
anything I simply shouldn’t be, I 
love to cook. Recently, I became 
interested in chickpea pasta, 
which tastes much better than 
brown rice pasta and brings a 
different flavor profile entirely 
to one of my favorite pre-celiac 
dishes. I also make cauliflower 
pizza 
doughs 
and 
gnocchi, 

gluten free cookie skillets and 
gluten free banana bread. The 
substitutions I make for flour — 
opting for almond flour, coconut 
flour, rice and cauliflower have 
opened my eyes to substitutions 
I can be making for other 
ingredients as well — clarified 
ghee for butter and oil, cacao for 
chocolate, almond and coconut 
milk for regular dairy products 
and a myriad of vegetables for 
other common ingredients.

After 
getting 
past 
the 

separate pie on Thanksgiving 
— alone in its dingy glory, the 
awkward encounters and the 
occasional craving for chicken 
parmesan, celiac disease has 
been a blessing for me. It has 
pushed me into the kitchen, 
testing recipes, experimenting 
with flavors, trying new things. 
It has led me to opt for healthy 
alternatives, 
exploring 
the 

potential of food and its effects 
on my body. It has led me to 
celebrate the ingredients I can 
eat, to perfect my recipes and 
dishes and share them with 
those around me — especially 
those who can eat gluten — to 
show them that gluten free is not 
a burden, but a chance to look at 
things in a new light. I used to 
think my grandfather would roll 
over in his grave, a master chef 
and food connoisseur, imagining 
his granddaughter and her small 
intestine opposing of pasta and 
pizza and cannolis and the like. 
But I’m sure he actually looks 
down on me with pride, my 
defeats accepted and turned into 
gluten free triumphs, navigating 
the world of food as it should 
be navigated: with a unique 
perspective, fresh ideas and a 
pot of water, salted and boiling 
on the stove.

Josephine 
Decker’s 

(“Flames”) 
latest 
cinematic 

offering, 
“Madeline’s 

Madeline,” hails from one of 
the most difficult-to-achieve 
subgenres of cinema: art about 
art. The film is a deep-dive 
into the legitimacy of high 

art and creative authorship. 
Did 
I 
really 
write 
this 

review? I mean, of course I 
wrote this review, but is it 
truly mine? On one hand, my 
analysis 
and 
interpretation 

is 
a 
creative 
entity 
unto 

itself, one that seems like it 
would belong to me. On the 
other, though, nothing I can 
say here is exactly new, but 

a creative process balanced 
atop another creative process, 
that of Decker. They’re my 
words, sure, but they’re about 
her film, her ideas, her life. 
The film follows Madeline 
(Helena Howard), an angst-
filled 
teenager 
who 
joins 

a performance art theatre 
troupe led by the magnetic 
and 
talented 
Evangeline 

(Molly Parker, “1922”). Drawn 
in by Evangeline’s artistic 
vision, 
Madeline 
quickly 

earns the lead in the troupe’s 
upcoming 
production, 
but 

as the show starts to eerily 
mirror 
Madeline’s 
life, 
it 

becomes unclear where the 
performance ends, and just 
whose story Evangeline is 
telling.

It’s 
no 
secret 
that 
the 

upper echelons of high art 
love to pat themselves on the 
back and celebrate their own 
artistry. From the aptly named 
Evangeline to the masks and 
dances 
of 
the 
performers, 

Decker’s depiction of high art 
is imbued with an intense, 
borderline-violent 
level 

of 
religious 
zeal. 
There’s 

something decidedly cult-like 
about the troupe, amplified by 
Madeline’s desperate desire to 
find a community to which she 
belongs. Decker toys with this 
malicious fanaticism, using 
her lurid and intimate brand 
of cinematography to turn 
the mundane and ordinary 
into 
overwhelming 
sensory 

experiences. 
She 
offers 
a 

cinematic 
experience 
that 

audiences will be hard pressed 
to find anywhere else, taking 
the viewers into Madeline’s 
mind as she struggles with 
loneliness, mental illness and 
artistic 
discovery. 
I 
won’t 

mince 
words: 
“Madeline’s 

Madeline” is a weird, weird 
movie. 
Unlike 
similarly 

bizarre 
offerings 
such 
as 

Boots Riley’s “Sorry to Bother 
You” — where there’s ample 
creativity but little intent or 
precision — Decker wields 
her creative vision with poise 
and 
purpose, 
delivering 
a 

well-tested rumination on the 
creative process.

The film’s subject matter 

‘Madeline’s Madeline’ is a 
successful self-reference

FILM REVIEW
is decidedly self-referential, 
making it difficult to explain 
to those who haven’t seen it. 
Much of the wit in Decker’s 
writing rests on the layers of 
artistic performance present 
within the film, from plays-
within-plays to acting about 
acting. She positions these 
moments deftly, using them 
to make sharp observations 
about the nature of artistic 
performance. For example, the 
film is scathingly critical of the 
holier-than-thou 
pretension 

of the arthouse scene. When, 
the film asks, does art become 
less about documenting the 
human condition and more 
about 
masturbatory 
self-

celebration? If an artist were 
to cover themself in oil and 
lie screaming on a canvas, 
are they really making an 
artistic 
statement? 
Decker 

weaves these questions into 
the narrative as Madeline and 
Evangeline take its twists and 
turns.

Decker is able to pull these 

feats off with the assistance 
of Helena Howard. In her 
film debut, the young actress 

proves herself capable beyond 
her years, flaunting a range 
that should be the envy of 
many 
veteran 
performers. 

Her relationships with the 
mentors in her life take a 
variety of permutations from 

loving 
and 
supportive 
to 

borderline oedipal to outright 
adversarial. 
Nevertheless, 

Howard’s energy is incendiary 
as she makes each of these 
dynamics uniquely her own. 
If this weren’t enough of a 
challenge, she’s also asked 
to pantomime a number of 
animals, including a cat, a sea 
turtle and a pig. 

Wonderfully 
weird 
but 

surprisingly 
grounded 

and 
coherent, 
“Madeline’s 

Madeline” never lets its own 
surrealism stop it from sending 
a coherent message or telling a 
well-crafted story, a problem 
that seems to have plagued 
similarly 
experimental 

releases. Decker manages to 
hone her artistic vision to a 
point, creating a film that is a 
creatively unprecedented but 
all the while neatly assembled 
affair. In the end, “Madeline’s 
Madeline” serves as proof of 
its own hypothesis: The artist 
must control their art, lest it 
control the artist.

Wolverines offensive line still has a way to go in run blocking

The Michigan football team 
was without its starting running 
back in its win over SMU. After 
getting banged up in practice, 
senior Karan Higdon missed 
Saturday’s 
game 
with 
an 
undisclosed injury.
The status of Higdon, as well 
as junior running back Chris 
Evans, is not yet clear. Evans 
limped off the field following a 
35-yard scamper in the fourth 
quarter and didn’t return. 
“Karan 
was 
a 
game-time 
decision, just didn’t feel like 
he could go,” said coach Jim 
Harbaugh in his postgame press 
conference. “And then Chris, we’ll 
see what his situation is exactly. 
It is like a strain or a cramp. We’ll 
see (about next week).”
The 
Wolverines 
missed 
Higdon’s 
down-hill 
style 
in 
short-yardage situations, instead 
relying on the shiftier Evans and 
junior Tru Wilson. Both finished 
with respectable numbers — 
Evans had 18 carries for 85 yards 
while Wilson gained 53 yards 
on 11 rushes — but not without 
moments of ineffectiveness.
Michigan had seven runs of 
one yard or less and averaged 
just 2.8 yards-per-carry in the 
first half. The running game’s 
inefficiency 
prevented 
the 
Wolverines’ offense to find the 
the end zone more than twice in 
the first half against a defense 
that had allowed 88 points 
through two weeks.
The series of small ground 
pickups were reminiscent of the 
Wolverines’ season-opening loss 
at Notre Dame. Out-manned by a 
dominant front-seven, Michigan 
rushed 33 times for just 58 yards. 
But a 308-yard, two-touchdown 
effort last week against Western 
Michigan 
quieted 
concerns 
about the Wolverines’ run game.
That was until Saturday’s first 
half. 
Higdon’s absence undoubtedly 
made a difference. There’s a 
reason he’s Michigan’s first-
string back. But to find the true 
culprit behind the tempered 
running game, look no further 
than the Wolverines’ offensive 

line. Sounds familiar, right?
It’s the same five starters 
that were maligned for their 
pass protection in Week 1. 
Though junior quarterback Shea 
Patterson hasn’t been pressured 
as consistently since, Michigan’s 
front is still lapse-prone in run 
blocking. Let’s roll the film.
The situation: 3rd-and-1 on 
Michigan’s first drive
Higdon’s absence was first 
detrimental on the game’s third 
play from scrimmage. Needing 
just a yard to move the chains, the 
Wolverines line up I-formation 
and handoff to Evans. It’s simple, 
Jim Harbaugh power football.
Only power football doesn’t 
work without blocking — nothing 
does.
Moving off the left side of 

the formation, redshirt junior 
tight end Zach Gentry whiffed 
on his primary target at the 
second level. Junior right guard 
Michael Onwenu 
and 
sophomore 
fullback 
Ben 
Mason, 
meanwhile, 
can’t 
seal 
the 
defensive 
end, 
forcing Evans to 
cut inside. That’s 
where 
Gentry’s 
assignment, 
linebacker 
Trevor Denbow, 
had 
already 
come 
through, 
dropping the Michigan ball-
carrier for a loss.
Whether 
or 
not 
Hidgon 
would’ve gotten the first down is 

besides the point. Gentry, Mason 
and Onwenu all missed or over-
ran blocks.
Sometimes, 
the 
problem 
is 
not 
limited 
to 
offensive 
linemen.
The situation: 
2-and-1, 
scoreless in the 
1st quarter
Another short-
yard 
situation 
with 
similar 
results. 
Here, 
the 
Wolverines’ 
interior line falls 
apart. Onwenu and junior left 
guard Ben Bredeson generate 
zero push off the snap, and once 
the SMU’s linebackers meet the 
pile, sophomore center Cesar 

Ruiz falls over.
This was never going to be 
a big play for Michigan. The 
Mustangs have too many heads 
in the box, as they’re anticipating 
an inside run in the redzone.
But after a strong performance 
last week, Bredeson, Owenu and 
Ruiz struggled to create space 
against a mediocre defensive 
line. It’s one thing to get beat by 
Notre Dame’s Jerry Tillery — a 
top-end NFL defensive tackle 
prospect. It’s another to struggle 
against a defense that’s now 0-3.
The situation: 1st-and-15, 
Michigan up 15 in the 4th 
quarter
This is an example of the 
Wolverines’ play-calling working 
to perfection.
After gaining 11 yards on 

an Ambry Thomas jet sweep 
in 
the 
first 
half, 
Michigan 
sent sophomore wide receiver 
Nico Collins in motion across 
the formation. This attracts 
the 
attention 
of 
two 
SMU 
linebackers, who are caught 
motionless or moving left when 
Evans gets the handoff.
Simultaneously, 
Onwenu 
sealed 
his 
block 
and 
both 
Bredeson and senior left tackle 
Jon Runyan Jr. get to the second 
level, and Evans was off to the 
races.
That jet sweep action won’t 
work every time. But if the 
Wolverines can find other ways 
to make defenses hesitate, expect 
more big runs like this despite 
Michigan’s share of blocking 
blunders.

ALEC COHEN/Daily
Junior left guard Ben Bredeson and the Michigan offensive line didn’t get as much push in the running game against SMU as they did the week before in the Wolverines’ win over Western Michigan.

“... Chris, 
we’ll what his 
situation is 
exactly.”

Harbaugh, players react to targeting calls

How do you fix something 
that doesn’t seem wrong to 
you?
It’s a question coach Jim 
Harbaugh and his players are 
trying to figure out themselves. 
Early in the third quarter of 
Saturday’s game against SMU, 
junior VIPER Khaleke Hudson 
was 
ejected 
for 
targeting 
after he initiated helmet-to-
helmet contact with Mustangs 
quarterback William Brown on 
a run play.
In 
Harbaugh’s 
weekly 
Monday press conference, he 
didn’t understand the call.
“Waiting for clarification 
on the targeting, still not with 
that one,” Harbaugh said. “I’d 
like an explanation, we’d all 
like an explanation on that. 
You compare it to other plays in 
the game where you’re hitting 
a ball carrier with the crown of 
your helmet, that’s happened 
a lot. In fact, the runner is 
leading with the crown of their 
helmet when they’re running 
a play. Didn’t think Khaleke’s 
was with the crown of his 
helmet. I thought he led with 
his shoulder.”
As 
the 
NCAA 
football 
rulebook states: “No player 
shall target and make forcible 
contact to the head or neck area 
of a defenseless opponent with 
the helmet, forearm, hand, fist, 
elbow or shoulder.”
The 
impact 
of 
the 
aforementioned 
rule 
and 
its refinements to increase 
player safety have been highly 
publicized in recent years — a 
judgment typically drawing ire 
from coaches for its inherent 
subjectivity. Whether or not 
Hudson led with his shoulder 
or head, there was indisputable 
contact made with the crown 
of Brown’s helmet, which is 
defined as any area above 
the facemask, 360 degrees 
around the helmet. The players 
understand 
that 
targeting 

is not exclusive to helmet 
hits, but the definition of 
“forcible contact” has spurred 
disagreement.
“When a person like that is 
moving so fast, and the decision 
is almost instant and he ducks 
his head, I have nothing else 
left to hit besides lower my 
head lower than his and hurt 
my neck for him,” said junior 
middle linebacker Devin Bush. 
“It’s 
kinda 
hard to make 
those decisions 
going that fast.
“(Referees 
are) 
more 
trigger-happy 
with 
it. 
Any 
sign of a person 
getting 
hit, 
and it makes 
a certain kind 
of 
sound 
or 
their neck goes a certain way, 
they’re throwing a flag. If I’m 
hitting a person and I could get 
kicked out of the game for that, 
I’m only hurting my team for 
trying to win.”
Hudson’s 
ejection, 
which 
will force him to also miss the 
first half of the Big Ten opener 

against Nebraska on Saturday, 
was 
already 
the 
second 
targeting call for a Michigan 
player through three games. 
Early into the season opener 
against Notre Dame, junior 
safety 
Josh 
Metellus 
was 
ejected for targeting Fighting 
Irish tight end Alize Mack on a 
26-yard reception.
Again, the referee’s decision 
bred confusion and a sobering 
realization.
“It’s 
just 
something we’ve 
gotta live with 
and work around 
with the rules 
of 
the 
game 
changing,” 
said 
senior 
safety 
Tyree 
Kinnel. 
“I didn’t think 
Khaleke 
or 
Josh committed 
targeting, but the ref called it 
so we’ve gotta deal with it.”
In the aftermath of the 
targeting calls, the defensive 
players 
have 
remained 
steadfastly 
confident 
that 
it’s an issue that can be 
mitigated, and one that can be 
overcome when faced in games. 

Kinnel later praised backup 
safety Brad Hawkins for his 
emergence in the secondary, as 
well as backup VIPER Jordan 
Glasgow in the absence of 
Hudson in the second half.
But 
for 
others, 
like 
cornerbacks 
coach 
Mike 
Zordich, the reality of the 
now 
oft-enforced 
targeting 
rules has changed the way he 
coaches his unit.
“We watch film on things of 
that nature to remind the guys 
of those hits, those helmet-to-
helmet (hits),” Zordich said 
after the Notre Dame game. 
“When I played, this is what 
it was all about — you put your 
face on things. Now you’ve got 
to keep that out of the way. It’s 
a whole different way to play.
“And I totally appreciate 
it. But don’t hurt the team 
because of a judgment call.”
For 
now, 
Harbaugh, 
Zordich and their team await 
explanations from the Big Ten 
office about the targeting calls 
and other penalties the team 
inquired about. But even with 
clarification, a quick fix that 
satisfies all parties isn’t in the 
cards.

‘M’ drops its first set of 
season, still beats Irish

Here’s something you haven’t 
heard all year — the No. 18 Michigan 
volleyball team dropped a set.
Then again, here’s something you 
have — the Wolverines won.
If you asked them, they would 
only talk about the latter, not that 
the team ignored dropping a set. 
It’d be hard to avoid when making 
adjustments and improvements. But 
in the bigger picture of things, it was 
what it’s been all year — a non-factor.
“I don’t even think we set any 
expectations,” said Michigan coach 
Mark Rosen on dropping a set. “We 
didn’t think we weren’t going to drop 
a set all season long. Nobody really 
felt that was a thing.
“It was more about how we 
recovered from that just like in any 
match and first set, second set, and 
especially third set, ‘How are we 
going to do the next set?’ And I think 
they responded well.”
After 32 consecutive set wins, 
the Wolverines dropped one in 
their matchup against Notre Dame 
during the backend of a home-and-
away. The usually disciplined team 
committed 26 errors compared 
to the Fighting Irish’s 18, and the 
balanced offense Michigan prides 
itself on was reduced to a season-low 
.093 attack percentage for the losing 
third set.
But it was all within the game 
plan.
Not losing a set that is, but 
encountering 
the 
heavy 
and 
suffocating Notre Dame defense, 
adjusting to the schemes and 
bouncing back.
“They did a really good job of 
adjusting to us,” Rosen said. “They’re 
a very good defensive team. They can 
do some things to take things away 
from you.”
The adjustments didn’t start 
straight out of the fold, though. Rosen 
pointed to attack percentage and kills 
as indicators of the Wolverines’ hot 
start. Eighteen kills on 36 attempts — 

a .361 attack percentage — for a single 
set are the most efficient posted by 
Michigan in the Notre Dame series. 
The second set is when the chess 
match began for Rosen, however.
“They made some adjustments 
in the second set,” Rosen said. “And 
they took some things away from 
us that we did really well, and the 
game started flipping. Our offense 
certainly was not efficient. We were 
able to pull it out, but I don’t think we 
were playing great.
“It was kind of a back-and-forth 
thing where there were lots of 
adjustments made with them and 
us.”
In order to clinch an up-and-
down second set, senior outside 
hitter Carly Skjodt and junior setter 
Mackenzi Welsh had to post back-
to-back kills when the set was tied, 
23-23. Skjodt had a team-high 13 
kills and added 16 digs for a double-
double. Welsh posted a game-high 46 
assists while expanding the team’s 
offensive options when the Fighting 
Irish figured out how to counter the 
initial offense.
And after the third set, Michigan 
needed it. With just 11 kills and a .093 
attack percentage — a percentage 
well below the standards of any team 
— the Wolverines looked to their 
depth for an answer. And thus the 
adjustments began.
Using 
the 
middle 
offense 
more, junior outside hitter Sydney 
Wetterstrom 
and 
sophomore 
middle blocker Kiara Shannon saw 
an immediate impact early in the 
final set that helped atone for the 
plethora of errors committed by 
the early offense. With a 5-0 burst 
late in the set due to the rotation of 
bench players, Michigan overcame 
Notre Dame, which had a top-heavy 
offense and relied on three players for 
the majority of its offensive impact.
And the Wolverines had all 
seen this before, in the teams’ prior 
matchup on Friday. But as Rosen 
noted, “Part of it is that you’re used to 
it or you’ve seen it, but it doesn’t make 
it any easier.”

Michigan extends win streak to five

Sophomore forward Umar 
Farouk 
Osman 
netted 
two 
goals 
in 
a 
showing 
that 
propelled the Michigan men’s 
soccer team (1-0-0 Big Ten, 
5-1-0 overall) to a victory over 
Rutgers (0-1-0, 1-4-1), 2-0 on 
Friday night. Michigan coach 
Chaka Daley spoke glowingly 
of 
the 
Wolverines’ 
newest 
star after the game, who has 
already matched his scoring 
total from all of last season 
with four.
“He was definitely on the 
crest of the hill last year,” 
Daley said. “And now he’s 
growing leaps and bounds and 
getting some confidence by 
scoring a few goals. And as a 
result of that, it’s given him 
the confidence to shoot and 
take chances.”
Osman launched a booming 
kick from outside the box off a 
perfect pass from sophomore 
forward 
Mohammed 
Zakyi 
that curled into the top left 
corner of the net to give 
Michigan a 1-0 advantage in 
the 62nd minute.
“I looked up at the goal and 
just bended it, top corner,” 

Osman said when discussing 
the play.
 The Wolverines doubled 
their lead just four minutes 
later when Osman tapped in 
a ball that had been deflected 
by a Rutgers defender on a 
Michigan throw-in. While it 
wasn’t nearly as impressive as 
his first goal, it still gave the 
Wolverines 
a 
much-needed 
cushion as they were able 
to 
cruise 
for 
the rest of the 
match. 
While 
Michigan 
dominated 
the 
scoreboard, 
the game was 
not without its 
tough moments. 
Rutgers 
nearly 
had 
a 
chance 
to score on a 
corner attempt that clanked off 
the post, and the Wolverines 
struggled 
to 
get 
into 
an 
offensive 
rhythm 
despite 
controlling possession for the 
majority of the first half. 
“I think we’ve just shown 
great 
togetherness, 
great 
resiliency,” Daley said. “Every 
game they’ve had their tough 
moments, and I think they’ve 

just stuck together and we’ve 
been very unselfish. We’ve 
worked hard for each other, 
we compete for each other, and 
we’ve just found a way in each 
of these games.”
While Michigan has a five-
game win streak on paper, 
Daley and his squad truly 
only care about one win in 
their record: Rutgers. That 
one match marks the number 
of 
wins 
the 
Wolverines 
have in Big Ten 
play 
thus 
far, 
after 
starting 
conference 
play 
with 
a 
win in one of 
the 
toughest 
conferences 
in 
college soccer.
“The 
season 
starts over, and 
fortunately we’re 1-0,” Daley 
said. “We don’t worry (about) 
all the others, five in a row, 
that’s out of our system. We’re 
just 1-0, we’re just worried 
about the Big Ten right now. 
We’re 1-0 in the Big Ten, we 
have our noses in front, and we 
have a lot of work to do. It’s a 
long season and a lot of tough 
opponents ahead.”

Wolverines’ offense growing, used ‘half’ of playbook so far this season

The Michigan football team’s 
offense 
is 
already 
showing 
signs of improvement from a 
season ago.
Between 
three 
starting 
quarterbacks and an offensive 
line that couldn’t keep them 
upright, 
the 
Wolverines 
ranked among the Big Ten’s 
worst in yards-per-play, points 
and 
third-down 
conversion 
rate in 2017. Three games 
aren’t enough to start making 
statistical 
comparisons. 
But 
they’re plenty to see an elevated 
level of play. 
Just take Michigan’s second 
touchdown Saturday in its win 
over SMU. From the Mustangs 
seven 
yard-line, 
junior 
quarterback 
Shea 
Patterson 
lobbed a back-shoulder fade to 
sophomore receiver Donovan 

Peoples-Jones, who adjusted 
in mid-air to corral the pass. A 
completion of that difficultly 
simply 
wouldn’t 
have 
been 
made last season.
Instead, 
more 
simplistic 
throws 
were 
the 
concern. 
Even when Michigan’s young 
receivers 
got 
separation, 
passing 
opportunities 
were 
frequently 
either 
errant 
or 
not seen entirely because the 
quarterback was on his back. 
But Patterson has been mostly 
on the money in three starts 
so far, completing roughly 70 
percent of his passes for 589 
yards and six touchdowns.
“He’s getting out of trouble 
and 
creating 
plays 
when 
sometimes 
there 
isn’t 
one 
to be there,” said coach Jim 
Harbaugh following Saturday’s 
game. 
“He’s 
playing 
the 
position really well and making 
the throws when they present 

themselves. 
He’s 
hitting 
the short ones, he’s hitting 
the intermediate ones, he’s 
hitting the deep ones. Good 
quarterback play.”
Improved quarterback play 
hasn’t changed the Wolverines’ 
play-calling 
too 
much, 
though. Despite 
the 
departure 
of 
offensive 
coordinator 
Tim 
Drevno, 
Michigan 
has 
maintained 
a 
run-first 
approach to try 
to open passing 
opportunities. 
Per 
teamrankings.com, 
the 
Wolverines 
threw 
on 
42 
percent of their plays last year 
— their exact distribution so far 
in 2018.

Michael Onwenu does think 
Patterson has become more 
ingrained in the offense since 
fall camp, but he doesn’t expect 
Michigan to run an air-raid 
system anytime soon.
“Since 
we 
have 
a 
new 
quarterback, 
I 
think 
we’re 
incorporating 
him 
more,” 
Onwenu 
said. 
“I’m not saying 
we’re 
building 
the 
offense 
around him, but 
it’s meshing at a 
good time.”
Establishing 
an 
offensive 
identity takes time. What the 
Wolverines are calling now 
is different from what they’ll 
be able to run in November. 
After all, Harbaugh’s West 
Coast offense is known for 

its complexities, filled with 
variations that could fill an 
NFL playbook.
At times, it looked like 
too much for Michigan last 
season, especially given its 
quarterback turnover. That’s 
why, this fall, the Wolverines 
learned the playbook at a 
tempered pace.
“I wouldn’t say slower, but it’s 
definitely less,” Onwenu said. 
“Last year, we were installing 
about 10 plays every few days. 
Fast-forward 
to 
this 
year’s 
camp, and we’re installing basic 
plays that we already knew but 
are taking time to master.”
Re-learning 
plays 
makes 
sense considering the addition 
of 
Patterson. 
Coming 
from 
a spread offensive system at 
Mississippi, he wasn’t forced to 
learn a playbook as expansive 
as Harbaugh’s.

Michigan hasn’t either — yet. 
Onwenu said the Wolverines 
haven’t 
shown 
“half” 
its 
playbook through three games 
and are installing plays “week 
to week.”
“We definitely have a lot of 
weapons that we haven’t used 
yet,” Onwenu said. “We have so 
much more we can improve on.”
Time will tell what those 
weapons are. Michigan would 
certainly benefit from more 
explosiveness and plays down 
field. 
Still, 
with 
Patterson 
under center, the Wolverines 
are confident in their offense’s 
development.
“They got a high ceiling,” 
said junior linebacker Devin 
Bush. 
“They 
got 
a 
lot 
of 
playmakers over there that can 
do something with the ball in 
their hands. I think they’re 
getting better at what they do.”

Junior offensive guard Michael Onwenu says Michigan’s offense can still improve greatly, and that they have shown less than half of their playbook so far.

“We have so 
much more we 
can improve 
on.”
