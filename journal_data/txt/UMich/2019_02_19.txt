About 60 people gathered at 
the Ann Arbor Federal Building 
on Monday and marched in 
protest of President Donald 
Trump’s national emergency 
declaration. 
Organized 
by 
local organization Stop Trump 
Ann Arbor, the protest was one 
of 262 noontime Presidents 
Day protests around the nation 
coordinated by MoveOn, a 
national organization focusing 
on education and advocacy 
through petitions, supporting 
campaigns 
and 
mobilizing 
events.
On their website, MoveOn 

referred to the protests as 
“rapid-response events.”
“Donald Trump has declared 
a 
#FakeNationalEmergency 
– an illegal power grab from 
an unhinged man to push his 
racist, 
dangerous 
policies,” 
the MoveOn website reads. 
“We’re 
mobilizing 
rapid-
response events on Presidents 
Day – Monday, 2/18 – against 
Trump’s fake crisis and racist 
deportation force and to stand 
with immigrant, Muslim, and 
Black and brown communities 
to stop Trump’s dangerous and 
illegal power grab.”
On Friday, Trump declared 
a 
national 
emergency 
to 
obtain funding Congress had 
refused him in their latest 

spending bill for a wall along 
the U.S.-Mexico border. The 
national 
emergency 
would 
provide access to about $8 
billion in total with about 7 
billion pulling from military 
construction 
projects, 
counter-narcotics 
programs, 
and a Treasury Department 
asset forfeiture, which is more 
than the $5.7 billion Trump 
had originally requested from 
Congress. 
Trump 
already 
received 
$1.3 
billion 
from 
Congress to build more fencing 
on the border.
The 
move 
has 
divided 
Republicans lawmakers, some 
of whom joined the Democrats 
in opposing Trump’s national 
emergency declaration. The 

administration is also facing 
legal pushback, much of which 
focuses on Trump’s Friday 
remarks about the declaration.
“I could do the wall over 
a longer period of time,”” 
Trump said Friday. ““I didn’t 
need to do this. But I’d rather 
do it much faster.””
Jessica 
Prozinski, 
co-founder of Stop Trump 
Ann Arbor and co-organizer 
of Monday’s protest, explained 
one goal of the protest was 
to impel Congress to reject 
Trump’s 
declaration 
and 
override any potential veto.

ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

On Monday night, the 
Ford School of Public Policy 
hosted 
U.S. 
Rep. 
Debbie 
Dingell, 
D-Mich., 
and 
Fred 
Upton, 
R-Mich., 
to 
participate in an installment 
of the Conversations Across 
Difference 
Policy 
Talks 
speaker series. The event 
was hosted at Annenberg 
Auditorium in the Public 

Policy School. Titled “Voices 
from Across the Aisle,” the 
event was co-sponsored by 
the Program in Practical 
Policy 
Engagement 
and 
student 
organization 
WeListen as a means of 
discussing 
the 
political 
divide in American politics.
The audience consisted 
of about 200 Ann Arbor 
residents, 
ranging 
from 
local 
professionals 
and 
community 
members 
to 
University 
of 
Michigan 

faculty 
members 
and 
students. 
The 
event 
concluded with a reception 
where 
during 
which 
all 
of 
the 
attendees 
were 
encouraged 
to 
stay 
and 
mingle with the speakers 
as a means of encouraging 
further discussion in a less 
formal setting. Michael Barr, 
dean of the Public Policy 
School, 
briefly 
addressed 
the audience at the start of 
the night to introduce the 
premise of the forum.

“Congresswoman Dingell 
and 
Congressman 
Upton 
… do represent different 
parties 
and 
different 
constituencies, parties and 
peoples 
with 
sometimes 
different 
ideologies 
and 
different policy positions,” 
Barr 
said. 
“This 
session 
will look at the manner by 
which such divergence helps 
or sometimes hinders the 
democratic process, in how 
we can work better together. 

The University of Michigan 
Spectrum Center collaborated 
with the Rackham Graduate 
School and medical student 
organization 
OutMD 

Monday to host a panel of 
LGBTQ-affirming 
medical 
professionals. During the event 
held at Rackham Auditorium, 
University faculty and health 
service professionals discussed 
their experiences with LGBTQ-
identifying patients and offered 
advice to undergraduate and 
graduate 
students 
seeking 
reliable and friendly health care.
OutMD 
is 
a 
student 
organization within the Medical 
School for LGBTQ-identifying 
medical students and their 
allies. OutMD helped organize 
the event and aims to spread 
the word regarding disparities 
LGBTQ patients face within 
medicine and health care.

MDining staff

polar vortex 

Students not considered critical employees, 
not compensated for work during days off

Mika LaVaque-Manty, LSA Honors 
Program 
director 
and 
associate 
professor of political science, addressed 
the ways in which rule-following 
affects one’s life during the LSA Student 
Honor Council speaker event titled 
“Your life, Your rules” Monday night.
LaVaque-Manty 
used 
his 
background in philosophy to examine 
the ideas of multiple philosophers 
including Mencius, Aristotle and 
Immanuel Kant. In his presentation, 
LaVaque-Manty explained how the 
actions a student takes may have a 
major effect on their future and said 
students should consider the reasoning 
behind their decisions.
“My argument today is not going 
to be against instrumental reasons — 
that is, doing things because we get 
something out of it — but I’m going to 
suggest that there are other reasons 
beyond instrumental reasons, or that 
sometimes it’s actually helpful to 
not think in terms of instrumental 
reasons,” LaVaque-Manty said.

MDining 
student 
employees were not paid 
overtime nor given any extra 
compensation for their work 
during 
the 
polar 
vortex 
when all events and classes 
were canceled due to severe 
cold 
weather, 
University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald 
said.
Jennifer 
Plascencia, 
LSA senior and MDining 
employee, said MDining was 
conflicted 
about 
whether 
to stay open during the 
polar vortex. She said she 
ultimately decided to work 
during those two days to 
make it easier for residents 
to eat, despite knowing she 
would not get extra pay. 
“Given our dining hall 
size, we could have easily 
just closed and said ‘you guys 
can go eat at South Quad or 
wherever else you want to 
eat,’” she said. “But we didn’t. 
We opened up both days and 
it went well.”
From Jan. 30 to the morning 
of Feb. 1, the University 
issued 
an 
emergency 
reduction of operations as a 
result of frigid, below-zero 
temperatures across the
Midwest. The polar vortex, 

which killed more than 20 
people around the country, 
set record temperature wlows 
for Michigan and resulted in 
the closure of many schools, 
businesses and universities.
The last time the University 
canceled classes and other 
campus events was due to a 
snowstorm in February 2015. 
In the past 40 years, the 
University has only closed 
four times. 
Fitzgerald 
said 
because 
student employees are not 
“critical employees,” they do 
not have to report to work 
when there is an emergency 
reduction of operations. He 
also said this status prevents 
student 
employees 
from 
receiving 
extra 
benefits 
during 
an 
emergency 
reduction 
of 
operations, 
which 
is 
what 
occurred 
during the polar vortex.
“Specific 
to 
MDining, 
student 
employees 
are 
not designated as ‘critical 
employees,’” Fitzgerald said. 
“So they are not required 
to work when there is a 
reduction in operations. If 
they choose to work those 
days, they are paid their 
regular hourly rate.”

The 
Center 
for 
Campus 
Involvement 
hosted 
a 
conversation 
Monday 
night 
on 
professional, 
casual 
and 
romantic 
interracial 
relationships as a part of their 
Hot Topic Series. The event was 
entitled “Unpacking Interracial 
Relationships”. 
CCI 
began 
the series using the funding 
they received from a Diversity, 
Equity and Inclusion grant they 
received to encourage open 
discussions 
about 
common 
issues in the University of 
Michigan community. 
LSA 
junior 
Sunanda 
Adibhatla, 
DEI 
program 
coordinator for CCI and the 
event’s discussion facilitator, 
said she hopes the conversation 
will lead to ideas on how to 
eliminate stigmas surrounding 

minority groups.“
There’s still a lot of tension 
with 
people 
of 
different 
backgrounds,” Adibhatla said. 
“And we have some sort of 
subconscious biases towards 
how we interact with people. 
And the question is, how do 
we eradicate that or at least 
become aware of it? ”CCI 
program advisor Jamie Alt 
said she hoped the event would 
open students’ minds and lead 
to further conversation about 
interracial relationships.“
To be able to expand people’s 
minds about topics that are 
sometimes really challenging 
or give people a sense of fear 
that they can’t talk about that 
because of their identity or 
something,” Alt said. “So just 
trying to break those barriers 
about what it means to talk 
about topics that are around 
diversity, equity and inclusion.”

Attendees 
began 
by 
discussing their own identities 
and how they handle meeting 
new people.LSA junior Divya 
Gumudavelly said she thinks 
about the impact stereotypes 
have on people’s perceptions 
of 
her.“Regardless 
of 
who 
you are or where you come 
from, everyone already has 
a preconception of what you 
might be like based on what 
they see initially.” Gumudavelly 
said. “When I introduce myself, 
even if it is just saying my name 
correctly or people are like, ‘Oh 
your last name is really hard,’ 
just sort of breaking what sort 
of conceptions people have of 
me and to get to know me and 
not go off stereotypes.”
Alt 
responded 
by 
highlighting 
the difference between her and 
Gumudavelly’s 
experiences. 
She said she does not consider 
generalizations people might 
think about her when 
they first meet.
“I don’t ever think 
about a stereotype when 
I meet someone,” Alt said. 
“But that’s probably a lot 
of my privilege as a white 
woman from this country, 
that I just want people to 
think, ‘Oh she was nice.’”
Rackham 
student 
Ismael 
El-Tayuddin 
discussed the importance 
of 
having 
interracial 
relationships 
and 
interacting with people 
from all different cultures 
and 
backgrounds. 
He 
suggested talking with 
a 
close 
friend 
about 
their culture to properly 
understand it and then 
bring this new knowledge 
to all future experiences.
“I think it helps also to 
learn about other cultures 
by proxy,” El-Tayuddin 
said. “So if you have 
someone that you feel 
comfortable talking about 
issues with … you can get 

more information from them so 
when you do go out and interact 
with other people, you kind of 
know how to keep appropriate 
boundaries, what to say and not 
to say and how to be respectful 
towards other people.”
Adibhatla then discussed the 
gap in understanding different 
cultures between generations 
and how someone’s ethnicity is 
not the same as their beliefs.
“I think it is a misconception 
with older generations and 
with people here that values 
equate to culture which equates 
to race,” Adibhatla said. “You 
can find someone who has the 
same background as you and 
the same family traditions but 
has completely different morals 
than you.”
The event concluded by 
discussing what steps should be 
taken moving forward to reduce 
stereotypes and to increase 
open-mindedness on campus. 
El-Tayuddin 
said 
minority 
groups are used to interacting 
with other cultures and having 
interracial relationships. He 
called on white people to make 
the first move and step outside 
of their comfort zones.
“I always hear how American 
culture 
is 
the 
dominant 
culture,” 
El-Tayuddin 
said. 
“Our (minority groups) whole 
lives, we’re used to navigating 
that system and interacting 
with this mainstream culture, 
and then we go home and 
have this culture in our house. 
We’re already bicultural. But 
they’re (white people) in a 
space where they dominate the 
culture and they’re not used to 
having to do something that 
is uncomfortable for them or 
understand someone else. So I 
feel like it’s not really on me. I 
think it has to be more of a step 
on their part.”

LaVaque-Manty discussed a 
famous ethical question most 
commonly known as the trolley 
problem. In the hypothetical 
situation, a trolley car is headed 
down a track that has five 
people tied to it. To save these 
individuals’ lives, a person is 
next to a lever that can switch 
the track of the trolley, but the 
new track has one person tied to 
it, meaning the person pulling 
the lever will be responsible for 
their death. LaVaque-Manty said 
he disagrees with the ideology 
behind the trolley problem along 
with other similar hypothetical 
situations because they do not 
take the human experience into 
account.
“The problem with the trolley 
problem is that it doesn’t really 
ask who you are,” LaVaque-
Manty said. “It assumes that you 
just land here at this switch out 
of nowhere. Its other problem 

is that it asks you to think about 
the hypothetical, which is pretty 
hard to predict what we actually 
would do in that situation.”
LaVaque-Manty 
said 
his 
biggest issue with the trolley 
problem is that it does not discuss 
enough personal traits to make 
the situation more realistic.
“The problem I’m interested 
in is that it doesn’t assume that 
you have any kind of history,” 
LaVaque-Manty said. “It doesn’t 
assume anything about your 
motives, it doesn’t tell a story 
about how you got there, it 
doesn’t say anything about what 
makes you use that switch — it 
just assumes this.”
LaVaque-Manty 
continued 
his presentation by discussing 
questionnaires 
regarding 
character, such as the character 
and fitness test required to pass 
the bar exam or the FBI security 
clearance 
process. 
LaVaque-
Manty said in his experience as 
a professor, he has been asked 
about the character of former 
students who were applying for 

security clearance. Because he 
believes many students at the 
University of Michigan will 
be in these possible situations 
in the future, LaVaque-Manty 
advised students to leave a good 
impression on their professors.
“It’s helpful to remember what 
actually matters down the line 
are aspects of what we consider 
features of your character more 
than your intelligence or your 
grades,” LaVaque-Manty said.
Additionally, 
LaVaque-
Manty 
considered 
how 
a 
professor constructs a letter of 
recommendation. He broke down 
the structure he uses for writing 
his letters into four categories: 
an 
introduction, 
academic 
substances, personal attributes 
he has noticed and a summary. 
LaVaque-Manty emphasized the 
idea of building a relationship 
with your professors so they 
are able to write a substantial 
number of personal attributes.
“Showing those transcripts 
and talking about grades tells 
you all you should care about are 

grades,” LaVaque-Manty said. 
“It’s helpful to try to remember 
that every time you (focus on 
grades), you are actually sending 
a signal that either gives people 
an opportunity to say something 
beyond any merits or makes it 
impossible to do that.”
LaVaque-Manty said students 
should question whether their 
reasoning behind their behavior 
is ethical.
“I’m not suggesting that you 
should be so extreme as to think 
anything you do, you have to 
actually think, ‘What is my reason 
for doing that?’” LaVaque-Manty 
said. “But it’s worth our while to 
think about what our reasons are 
for our ethical behavior.”
To conclude his presentation, 
LaVaque-Manty asked students 
to focus on larger ideas when 
evaluating their decisions. He 
said the most important question 
students should ask themselves is 
who they want to be.

I think it’s an especially 
appropriate way for us to 
spend this afternoon of 
Presidents Day.”
He further emphasized 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
event by highlighting the 
need for open discourse 
between 
members 
of 
different parties.
“As 
you 
well 
know, 
these 
are 
extremely 
challenging 
times 
for 
our nation with fractious 
political 
discourse, 
gridlock and partisanship 
in our nation’s capital, 
and an increasing lack 
of 
trust 
in 
institution 
everywhere,” 
Barr 
said. 
“The 
relationship 
between 
Representatives 
Dingell and Upton is the 
antithesis 
of 
partisan 
politics operating today in 
Washington.”
Barr’s comments were 
followed by an interview 
segment featuring Dingell 
and Upton moderated by 
Public 
Policy 
professor 
Brendan Nyhan. Dingell 
and Upton shared their 
personal thoughts about 
bipartisanship in regard 
to a number of issues 
such as immigration, the 
economy, 
health 
care 
and the environment. In 
all 
of 
their 
responses, 
they 
emphasized 
their 
intention 
to 
work 

together to find solutions 
to these issues despite 
their 
different 
political 
ideologies.
“I made the decision 
that firstly, every issue 
I’ve ever worked on has 
been bipartisan,” Upton 
said. “I’ll meet you across 
the aisle. I’ve got a lot of 
friends like Debbie on the 
other side of the aisle and 
a lot of Republicans on 
my side that want to work 
together.”
Dingell built on Upton’s 
point 
by 
noting 
the 
importance of overcoming 
party 
boundaries 
to 
preserve 
American 
democracy.
“I’m 
worried 
about 
what is happening in the 
future of this country,” 
Dingell 
said. 
“I 
think 
every American’s got a 
responsibility to stand up 
to elect people that are 
going to do what’s right. 
And we need to worry 
about 
this 
democracy. 
I think we live in the 
greatest land in the world 
— united we stand and 
divided we fall.”
At one point in the 
discussion, 
Nyhan 
prompted the speakers to 
explore the possible merits 
of partisanship using his 
background knowledge of 
political science.
“Let me also give a 
plea 
for 
the 
value 
of 
bipartisanship 
and 
polarization,” Nyhan said. 

“Sometimes 
the 
parties 
do 
disagree 
and 
that’s 
an important part of our 
democracy, too. We just 
need to make sure not to 
lose sight of that. Political 
scientists think parties are 
essential 
to 
democracy; 
parties help … Contesting 
the issues of our days is 
important to our political 
systems, too.”
The 
forum 
was 
structured 
to 
provoke 
thought in the audience. 
Attendees were provided 
with small pieces of paper 
upon entry to the forum 
and 
encouraged 
to 
fill 
them with questions they 
would like the speakers to 
address at the end of the 
event. Upton emphasized 
the importance of this 
interaction.
“I think that part of the 
reason we’re here today is 
to talk about what really 
is happening,” Upton said. 
“Where is the bipartisan 
success? And for us to get 
encouragement from you 
that we’re on the right 
track here. … Part of it is 
an educational experience 
on both sides.”
Many 
attendees 
of 
the 
event 
concurred 
with 
Upton’s 
remarks, 
expressing a desire for 
communication as a means 
of learning more about the 
views of others.
Abigail Orrick, Public 
Policy graduate student, 
explained that she chose to 

attend the event because 
she wanted to broaden her 
own worldview.
“I think that the Ford 
School is predominantly 
liberal as (for) the beliefs 
of many of the students 
here and so I think that 
that 
can 
sometimes 
lead itself to … students 
being in a bubble and not 
necessarily being exposed 
to 
other 
viewpoints,” 
Orrick said. “And so I 
think that having events 
like this where you are 
listening to people who 
are out doing the real-
life policy-making in the 
world working across the 
aisle, I think that’s really 
valuable to be able to 
witness and hear from.”
Toward 
the 
end 
of 
the 
event, 
WeListen 
Co-Presidents Kate Westa 
and 
Brett 
Zaslavsky 
reiterated the importance 
of bipartisan cooperation 
as pertaining to the efforts 
of their organization.
“Congresswoman 
Dingell and Congressman 
Upton 
are 
exceptional 
examples of what we as 
an organization are trying 
to do,” Zaslavsky said. 
“We’re 
very 
thankful 
to the Ford School for 
bringing 
them 
in 
and 
really taking initiative on 
this event and for letting 
us be a part of the sort of 
facilitation of it.”

The speakers on the 
panel each had a unique 
perspective that allowed 
students 
to 
better 
understand the breadth 
of this topic, from both 
a student and a medical 
patient perspective.
The 
panel 
was 
moderated 
by 
Paul 
Artale, academic program 
manager 
for 
graduate 
student 
engagement 
at 
Rackham. After receiving 
feedback from an LGBTQ 
graduate 
student 
task 
force 
regarding 
topics 
they 
wished 
to 
see 
implemented 
by 
the 
school, 
Artale 
and 
his 
colleagues began curating 
an 
event 
focused 
on 
education 
and 
student 
engagement surrounding 
LGBTQ-affirming 
medicine.
“The 
goal 
is 
to 
give 
participants 
the 
opportunity to ask experts 
whatever questions they 
have, so hopefully they 
can 
get 
some 
specific 
advice that would help 
them in their situation,” 
Artale said.
When 
asked 
about 
their 
formal 
education 
surrounding 
affirming 
medical care and treating 
LGBTQ 
patients, 
the 
panelists 
agreed 
that 
little to no coursework 
was 
offered 
regarding 
this 
practice. 
Panelists 
explained it takes time 
and 
outside 
resources 
to learn about providing 
health care in a manner 
that 
welcomes 
trans, 
non-binary 
and 
queer 
individuals.
One of the panelists, 
Diana 
Parrish, 
a 
care 
manager 
through 
at 
the 
University 
Health 
Services, said learning to 
be an affirming provider 
required 
self-ref lection 
and 
distance 
from 
her 
personal identity in order 
to 
better 
understand 
LGBTQ 
experiences 
which may differ from her 
own.
“A turning point for 
me in being an affirming 
provider was recognizing 
several 
years 
ago 
that 
being queer myself is not 
enough — that’s not the 
whole 
story,” 
Parrish 
said. “I really appreciated 
being 
introduced 
to 
the concept of cultural 
humility as opposed to 
cultural competence.”

Affirming 
health 
care 
is 
necessary 
for 
many 
members 
of 
the 
LGBTQ 
community, 
as 
patients 
must 
ensure 
that 
their 
physicians 
are 
understanding 
and 
accepting 
of 
their 
identity. Discrimination, 
mistreatment 
and 
ignorance 
are 
just 
a 
few 
reactions 
LGBTQ 
individuals 
can 
receive 
when facing a healthcare 
provider, and finding the 
right provider can take 
time and energy.
According 
to 
the 
panelists, this affirmative 
attitude 
should 
span 
beyond 
the 
patient’s 
primary physician to the 
staff members and other 
employees in a medical 
environment. 
A 
poor 
interaction at the front 
desk or with a nurse may 
inhibit 
their 
comfort 
within the doctor’s office 
environment, 
especially 
for transgender and non-
binary people.
Another 
panelist, 

Daphna 
Stroumsa, 
a 
clinical 
lecturer 
and 
obstetrician-gynecologist 
in 
Michigan 
Medicine, 
noted the strength and 
resilience of the LGBTQ 
community 
and 
urged 
audience members to work 
together to ensure people 
are safe and comfortable 
in their environments.
“We hear a lot about 
how difficult it is to be 
(LGBTQ), and that’s true, 
but I think it’s worth 
mentioning 
how 
strong 
this 
community 
is,” 
Stroumsa said. “I think 
we as a community, as a 
community of providers, 
as 
a 
community 
of 
patients, 
can 
build 
on 
the strength to use our 
networks.”
Medical School student 
Anuj Patel, co-president 
of OutMD, attended the 
event hoping to educate 
the 
greater 
campus 
community 
about 
the 
conf licts LGBTQ people 
face in the medical field.
“LGBTQ 
people 
face 
a 
lot 
of 
health 
care 
disparities,” 
Patel 
said 
“For instance, they have 
higher rates of mental 
health 
(problems), 
depression 
and 
suicide. 
These (events) are really 
important to learn about 
ways LGBTQ people can 
feel more comfortable in 
health care environments 
and find providers that 
are right for them.”

DOCTORS
From Page 1

“We 
are 
calling 
on 
Congress to smack Trump 
down and say that this is not 
a valid national emergency, 
and if he tries to veto that, 
we need to get their two-
thirds majority to overrule 
his 
veto,” 
Prozinski 
said. 
“Our democracy is absolutely 
at stake. If Trump gets away 
with this, there are no checks 
and balances in our system 
any longer.”
Prozinski also condemned 
Trump’s 
previous 
actions, 
specifically 
the 
administration’s 
family 
separation 
policy 
in 
the 
summer of 2018.
“Trump’s 
national 
emergency is fake,” Prozinski 
said. 
“The 
real 
national 
emergency is Donald Trump. 
The real national emergency 
is that children were in cages, 
children have died in ICE 
custody. … We condemn the 
racism in Trump’s declaration 
of a national emergency at the 
border, and we will continue 
to do anything we can to 
resist until we get Trump out 
of office.”
The 
Ann 
Arbor 
event 
started with short speeches 
by co-organizers Prozinski 
and 
Adam 
Nash. 
In 
his 
remarks, 
Nash 
portrayed 
the 
declaration 
as 
unconstitutional, 
arguing 
instead for power from the 

people.
“We 
cannot 
normalize 
every step we take down 
this hole,” Nash said. “Some 
people say this emergency 
declaration is good — this 
just paves the way for our 
next Democratic president 
to 
declare 
an 
emergency 
to 
implement 
single-payer 
health care or gun control. 
But no — it’s very dangerous 
reasoning. 
No 
president 
should have this unchecked 
power. … The power has to 
come from the people. … 
People don’t understand how 
much power we have when 
we are united, when we are 
organized, we are working 
together to resist.”
Protesters walked for about 
an hour down Liberty Street 
with various handmade signs, 
chanting 
slogans 
such 
as 
“D.C. sellouts read our lips, no 
Trump dictatorship.”
LSA 
freshman 
Danielle 
Wachter said she came to 
the protest because she feels 
the proposed wall is not only 
ineffective but also does not 
warrant declaring a national 
emergency.
“The thing is a border 
wall won’t do anything to 
fix what he wants to fix, but 
also that’s not what a national 
emergency is,” Wachter said. 
“As president you can’t just 
declare a national emergency 
when you don’t get what you 
want. That’s the equivalent of 
throwing a tantrum. … I think 
we need to check him in any 

way possible.”

While 
most 
protestors 
were Ann Arbor residents 
or University of Michigan 
students, three high school 
students travelled about an 
hour from Davison, Mich. for 
the event. One of the Davison 
High 
School 
students, 
Brian Hall, a self-professed 
Republican, 
explained 
he 
came to participate in the 
protest because he believes it 
is important for students to be 
politically involved.
“I came out here today 
because I believe what the 
president’s doing is wrong and 
subverts the fundamentals 
of democracy,” Hall said. 
“I’m actually a Republican, 
but I think it’s important 
for people not to be blinded 
by their own ideology. … 
This is where students are 
really 
important, 
because 
students can literally change 
the course of our country. … 
In my government classes, 
I’ve learned a lot about what 
people can do to influence 
government, 
and 
I’ve 
realized that you don’t have 
to be an adult, you just have 
to be you.”
The Facebook event for 
the protest was shared on 
the Stop Trump Ann Arbor 
page on Saturday. The event 
came into action over the 
past three days, Prozinski 
explained.
“I was really pleased with 
the turnout today, especially 

so last minute, and during 
the workday,” Prozinski said.
As 
a 
student 
at 
the 
University 
in 
the 
1990s, 
Prozinski 
engaged 
in 
activism around issues such 
as affirmative action, anti-
fascism, rape and sexual 
harassment, and homeless 
rights. Until Trump’s victory, 
Prozinski had not been an 
activist for a while, she 
explains.
“I started Stop Trump 
Ann Arbor right after Trump 
was elected,” Prozinski said. 
“I’m a former activist, I 
haven’t been active in a long 
time, but then when Trump 
got elected, I had to start 
organizing again.”
Ann 
Arbor 
resident 
Cathy 
Helton 
attended 
the event with a sign that 
read, “This president is our 
national emergency.” When 
explaining her sign, Helton 
referenced Trump’s words.
“Congress 
is 
supposed 
to 
make 
decisions 
about 
funding, 
but 
now 
this 
president, 
he 
even 
gave 
his 
speech 
and 
said 
he 
didn’t have to do this now, 
which implies this isn’t an 
emergency,” 
Helton 
said. 
“This is something he wants 
to do for his campaign and for 
his base. … I really do think 
he is our national emergency. 

An 
MDining 
employee 
and LSA freshman, who 
asked to remain anonymous 
due 
to 
concerns 
about 
potential repercussions at 
his job, said he didn’t feel 
like he had much of a choice 
as to whether he could come 
to work or not.
“If 
we 
have 
a 
shift 
during those days, we were 
required to come in for work 
as usual,” he said.
Steve 
Mangan, 
senior 
director 
of 
MDining, 
declined to comment on 
the issue. When contacted 
by The Daily, South Quad 
supervisor 
Chuck 
Adams 
declined to comment on the 
situation due to MDining 
policy.
He said living in East 
Quad made it easier for him 
to go to work during the 
polar vortex. However, he 
said he felt other employees 
who had to commute to 
the dining hall in sub-zero 
temperatures should have 
received more compensation 
than just a few extra hours 
of vacation.
“Honestly, for many of 
the students, many of us live 
in East Quad, so it wasn’t 
really that hard for us to go 
to work,” he said. “But for 
many of the cooks and many 
of the chefs who actually 
had to travel to get to work 

and leave late at night, 
definitely for them they 
probably 
deserved 
better 
compensation 
than 
what 
they got.”
The 
University’s 
Standard 
Practice 
Guide 
Policies, 
which 
sets 
the 
terms for how employees 
are 
compensated 
during 
developing 
emergency 
conditions, 
emergency 
reduction of operations and 
reduction 
of 
operations, 
said regular staff were given 
one extra hour of vacation 
time for each hour worked 
during the two days classes 
and events were cancelled. 
However, because students 
working for MDining are 
classified under the SPG 
policies 
as 
temporary 
employees, they are paid 
only for time worked and do 
not receive extra benefits.
Plascencia said this lack 
of 
extra 
compensation 
didn’t seem to deter most of 
her student co-workers from 
coming into work.
“Overall, I would say that 
we were well-staffed both 
days,” she said. “I mean, the 
job that we have is not a job 
that you can’t show up for 
because if nobody shows up 
to work, then students can’t 
eat. So the attitude of a lot of 
us was just to show up and 
do what we had to do.”

T

he 
most 
common 

misconception regarding 
mental 
health 
is 
the 

pervasive idea that you can address 
it by simply exercising willpower. 
According to a Texas survey, about 
40 percent of people believe that 
depression is a lack of willpower. 
Similarly, I have had countless 
short-sighted conversations with 
my friends, family members and 
even Uber drivers who render 
medical and therapeutic assistance 
irrelevant 
by 
contending 
that 

depression or obsessive compulsive 
disorder can be combated with 
tenacity, as if individuals who 
seek treatment aren’t trying hard 
enough. These individuals — who 
are not mental health professionals 
— believe themselves to be doctors 
at the mere suggestion of mental 
health 
and 
begin 
diagnosing 

themselves and others. When we 
hear the phrase “heart disease,” 
no one ever declares themselves a 
cardiologist or diagnoses everyone 
they know with cardiovascular 
diseases. Yet, when it comes to 
mental illness, one that involves 
another organ — the human brain 
— we all presume credibility to 
offer unwarranted easy solutions, 
such as “just pull it together” or “try 
calm.com.”

I recently had an argument 

with my cousin when he jokingly 
mocked my harrowing experience 
with clinical depression in high 
school by calling me “weak” and 
then describing his “depressive 
episode” when he was upset with 
the outcome of the 2018 general 
elections in Bangladesh. We must 
eliminate such insidious inanities 
in mental health conversations 
and educate ourselves. J Raymond 
DePaulo, professor of psychiatry 
and behavioral sciences at Johns 
Hopkins University School of 
Medicine, has stated, “‘Stressful’ 
life events can lead to depression in 
some people and discouragement in 
others. One is an illness, the other is 
a natural response to misfortune,” 
and we must learn this crucial 
distinction.

Contrary to the erroneous 

belief that individuals with 
mental illness are weak and do 
not have the willpower to fight, 
I have always tried hard and I 
have persevered. No matter how 
much I meditated or worked 
out, I could not concentrate and 
multiple times I could not sleep 
for even a minute for up to five 
days in a row, but not a single 
person was aware of my pain. I 
concealed the scars of my self-
inflicted injuries and I went to 
class every single morning. In 
sophomore year, at my lowest 
point, when I realized I was on 
the verge of death, I fought every 
part of what was happening in my 
mind and dialed 911 myself and 
was immediately hospitalized 
for an attempt to commit suicide. 
Seeking help to find a will to exist 
in this world was my willpower.

From my experience, I have 

noticed that people often conflate 
depression with ordinary sadness, 
anxiety disorders with impatience, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder with casually zoning 
out in class, bipolar disorder with 
mood swings. As Maria Yagoda 

wrote in her essay in Broadly, “I 
exercise, I eat fruits … I do all the 
things that people suspect will 
cure me of depressive episodes, 
which they mistake for sadness 
… and I still need pills.” Likewise, 
when I tell individuals that I take 
Adderall for ADHD, as prescribed 
by my doctors, they insist they 
also have ADHD but can function 
without medication, — tacitly 
hinting I am weak because I take 
pills. The unsolicited declaration 
that you have been through the 
same amount of misery but you are 
stronger than those who receive 
treatment reflects grave ignorance 
about mental health.

These 
misinterpretations 

demonstrate our inability to accept 
mental illness as a biological, 
chemical 
imbalance. 
The 

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
for 
Mental 
Disorders 
defined 

mental illness as “a behavioral or 

psychological syndrome or pattern 
… the consequences of which 
are clinically significant distress 
… that reflects an underlying 
psychobiological 
dysfunction.” 

In other words, mental illness is a 
biological issue and, just like any 
other physical illness, it requires 
intervention that often includes 
medication. 
But 
psychiatric 

medication 
is 
another 
aspect 

of mental health that is heavily 
stigmatized.

The universal distaste for 

medication as treatment for mental 
health is the reason why I eschewed 
psychiatric help for years, why 
many of my friends prefer to suffer 
alone and potentially why Kanye 
West has publicly announced 
stopping his medication for bipolar 
disorder, without a doctor’s 
recommendations. 
Even 
the 

term “pill-shaming” has been 
coined 
to 
hypothesize 
the 

widespread shame attached to 
psychiatric 
medication. 
The 

societal mentality that those 
who take pills are “weak” was 
stated as a prevailing factor for 
people to abandon their medication.

The 
narrow-minded 

presumption that mental illness 
is choice or a temporary state 
of mind you can handle with 
positivity, yoga and a couple 
of breathing exercises is the 
reason why I chose to quell 
my horror and added another 
layer of pressure on myself 
when my life was hanging by a 
thread. A study mentions that 
clinician Julie Hanks has said, 
“Believing that someone can 
control their illness isn’t just 
unhelpful; it ‘may create another 
layer of pain or shame when the 
person suffering fails to make 
themselves feel better.’” A 2004 
report by the World Health 

Organization stated that between 
30 and 80 percent of people with 
mental health concerns never 
receive mental health treatment. 
Clinical psychologist David Susman 
analyzed the report and stated that 
fear and shame, lack of insights and 
feelings of inadequacy were some of 
the main reasons behind people not 
seeking help.

On the brighter side, Edmund 

S. Huggins accounts his own 
clinical experience and concludes 
that mental health treatment does 
“improve symptoms and quality of 
life by about 20 to 40 percent for 
most patients.” I strongly believe 
that if I had reached out for help 
earlier, high school and college 
wouldn’t have been so difficult for 
me, because my life significantly 
improved once I started the 
appropriate 
medication. 
But 

psychiatric care is undeniably tricky 
and dysfunctional. Improving the 
accessibility for mental health care 
is also a topic worth debating. 
Medications from pharmaceutical 
powerhouses are suspicious and 
it took me a plethora of different 
psychiatrists 
and 
multiple 

different combinations of Ritalin, 
Lexapro, Xanax, Clonazepam, 
Trazodone, Zoloft, Wellbutrin, 
Ambien, 
Seroquel, 
Lamictal 

and Benadryl (I might even be 
missing some) to find the regimen 
that works for me. I have many 
concerns regarding the lengthy 
process of getting help, but that is 
for another column.

First, we must accept the 

medical and biological component 
of mental health because to deny 
it is to sustain the delusive notion 
that mental illness is a period of 
heartbreak one can will their way 
out of. Though it can be flawed, 
medical treatment is a necessity for 
many individuals: It can address 
symptoms and prevent relapses. 
Research shows that depression 
has nothing to do with being 
lazy and weak and that therapy 
and medication can precipitate 
recovery. 
A 
depressed 
person 

cannot simply force themselves 
to be happy because often times 
they cannot even control their 
source of happiness when they 
are experiencing a shortage of 
dopamine, the neurotransmitters 
that regulate emotions, especially 
motivation and reward.

We must understand that 

mental illness does not indicate 
personal failing in any way because 
it has nothing to do willpower. We 
have to stop pushing individuals to 
fight a debilitating disease that is 
not in their own control because 
this pressure has cost many lives. A 
2018 study published by Psychiatric 
Services and Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention concluded 
that untreated severe mental 
illness is a significant factor in the 
rising suicide rates in the United 
States. Thus, in order to save lives, 
we must implore individuals going 
through a rough time to reach out 
to a counselor and psychiatrist 
because it can ease their pain and 
make their lives more livable.

Illegitimate resistance

T

he arrangement of powers 
between lawmakers and law 
enforcement can seem very 

simple in the abstract. Lawmakers 
make the laws, and law enforcement 
enforces those laws. In practice, 
this relationship can be a bit more 
complicated. Politics and personal 
convictions muddy up an otherwise 
clear delineation of authority. 

In Washington state, authority 

has been muddied up beyond 
mere complication. Sheriffs in a 
dozen counties have committed 
to stop enforcing the expansive 
gun control law I-1639, passed in 
November by state referendum, at 
least until courts have decided on 
its constitutionality. Genuine, yet 
still illegitimate, the Washington 
sheriffs’ 
principled 
resistance 

illustrates 
a 
larger, 
troubling 

ideology of extremist Second 
Amendment interpretation.

What should first be made 

clear is that the sheriffs in question 
are not unaware of the moral 
dilemma posed by their actions. On 
one hand, there is the duty of law 
enforcement to carry out orders as 
they are given. This expectation 
is what enables us, as citizens, to 
trust that laws are worth the paper 
they are printed on. As Attorney 
General Robert Kennedy pointedly 
remarked to white Georgians in 
1961, on the subject of federally 
mandated school desegregation, 
“… (M)y belief does not matter 
– it is the law. Some of you may 
believe the decision was wrong. 
That does not matter. It is the 
law.” Washington state’s current 
attorney general, Bob Ferguson, 
has similarly reminded the sheriffs 
that “as public officers, (their) duty 
is to abide by the will of the people 
(they) serve, and implement and 
enforce the laws they adopt.”

On the other hand, society 

does well to ensure that law 
enforcement still maintains its oath 
to high principle. It is reassuring 
to have our laws enforced by real 
human beings, and not by blindly 
loyal androids devoid of moral 
conviction. Whichever of these 
conflicting commitments the 12 
sheriffs prioritize, in this case, 
is aptly laid out by Grant County 
Sheriff Tom Jones: “I swore an 
oath to defend our citizens and 
their constitutionally protected 
rights. I do not believe the popular 
vote overrules that.”

In essence, the actions of 

the sheriffs then constitute a 

rule departure, or the deliberate 
decision by authorities to not 
properly discharge their duties 
as their office requires. Are such 
acts inherently wrong? Recent 
American history would have us 
lean toward the affirmative. From 
Southern whites who resisted 
federal civil rights legislation to 
Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis 
and her infamous refusal to issue 
marriage licenses for gay couples, 
public 
officials 
supplanting 

professional loyalty with personal 
judgment have generally been 
overruled swiftly and without 
lasting repercussions.

Yet, the protestors do not likely 

view themselves in such light. 
To them, such dissidence is for 
the ultimate good of the people, 
whose liberty is secured by strong 
gun rights and thereby threatened 
by the referendum. Intelligent 
individuals could debate endlessly 
on the merits of this abrogation 
of traditional legislative power. In 
this case, however, one needs only 
to look at the sheriffs’ purported 
justifications for dissidence to 
see that they are, indeed, wrong 
to 
disobey 
the 
Washington 

referendum.

By reasonable standards, the 

actual policy measures put forth 
by I-1639 are wholly acceptable. 
The law raises the minimum 
age to purchase semi-automatic 
rifles from 18 to 21, and requires 
those purchasing them take a 
training course, pass an enhanced 
background 
check 
and 
wait 

10 business days before their 
purchased rifle can be delivered to 
them. What is at all unreasonable 
about a state requiring its residents 
to be of responsible age and 
capacity to own guns? How about 
a state ensuring guns are not sold 
to those with dangerous pasts or in 
unsound states of mind?

To those propositions, a truly 

reasonable gun enthusiast would 
not balk. Guns are powerful 
implements, so requiring gun 
owners to prove they are generally 
responsible and capable is far 
from the radical imposition these 
sheriffs have decried it as. Yet 
preventive measures such as these 
are often lamented by Second 
Amendment extremists as futile 
— as one of the participatory 
dissidents, Sheriff Bob Songer 
of Klickitat County fatalistically 
explains, “Bad guys are going to 
have guns regardless.” Songer 

may find it shocking that banks 
still enclose their cash in vaults, 
a truly useless protection against 
robbers who could seemingly “get 
in regardless.”

In addition to putting forth 

entirely reasonable public safety 
measures, 
I-1639 
successfully 

avoids imposing undue burdens 
on responsible gun owners. It does 
not categorically ban any type of 
firearm, and thereby protects the 
existing gun protections of all 
Washingtonians above the age 
of 21. Those who would invoke 
traditional definitions of the 
American militia in decrying 
this age increase would be 
hard-pressed to explain why a 
militia comprised of Americans 
aged 17 and up is impinged by 
gun purchase limits set at 21 
years of age, but not at 18 years 
of age (as is the case in most of 
the country). And, even though 
the law prevents 18 to 21-year-
old 
Washingtonians 
from 

owning semiautomatic rifles, a 
host of other firearms are still 
purchasable for hunting or home 
defense.

Yet it is perhaps in one of 

I-1639’s other provisions that 
the core of the problem is best 
illuminated. The law, in addition 
to these measures, establishes 
penalties for those adults careless 
enough to leave their firearm in 
the reach of children and burglars. 
Here, the state is attempting to 
reduce the risk that irresponsible 
gun owners leave their weapons 
vulnerable to theft or improper 
discharge. 
By 
imposing 

regulations for safe storage of 
firearms, it is protecting both the 
property and loved ones of firearm 
owners who would otherwise not 
know better. Likewise, several of 
Washington’s sheriffs appear to 
be protecting their citizens from 
what they believe to be misguided 
instincts. These sheriffs’ views on 
state authority, however, provide 
shaky ground for their subversive 
stand. That these views are highly 
problematic and faulted make 
them even more inadequate. 
Washington Attorney General 
Bob Ferguson is right to call his 
officers back to attention.

Mental illness is not a lack of willpower

Y

ou have probably found 
yourself in the same 
position a number of 

times: dying to listen to music, 
but unsure of exactly what 
you want to listen to, so you 
pull out a favorite playlist and 
hit shuffle. But what does the 
shuffle button actually do? 
What does it mean to shuffle 
through 
songs? 
How 
do 

your imaginations of shuffle 
actually align with the reality 
of how it functions? What can 
this tell us about psychology’s 
infusion 
with 
consumer 

technology?

Originally, 
I 
thought 

shuffling was a randomizer 
that gave you as random a 
song as possible. For a while, 
this was how most shuffling 
programs 
operated, 
but 

streaming services like Spotify 
started receiving complaints 
that the shuffle button was not 
random enough. For the coders 
at 
Spotify, 
this 
complaint 

was perplexing, as their code 
was based on the Fisher-
Yates Shuffle, which is often 
considered to be one of the best 
algorithms for randomization.

The people over at Spotify had 

a meeting and tried to dissect 
what the problem was. Their 
answer came down to an issue 
of human psychology. Imagine 
that someone flips a coin: If the 
person got heads five times in a 
row, on the next flip the person 
would expect to get tails because 
they have already flipped heads 
so many times. Of course, the 
rules of probability tell us that 
on the sixth flip, the chances 
of getting heads or tails is the 
same, as it is not influenced by 
the previous flips. But how does 
this relate to a Spotify playlist? 
Imagine that you are using a 
“truly random” shuffler and you 
hear “Gold Digger” by Kanye 
West. When you hit shuffle 
again, your expectation is that 
you won’t hear “Gold Digger,” 
but of course the probability of 

hearing “Gold Digger” is the 
same as any other song in the 
playlist.

Spotify realized that people 

didn’t want “true randomness,” 
but rather the human expectation 
of what should be random. So 
they recreated their algorithm 
based 
around 
clustering. 

The essential idea of the new 
algorithm is that when people 
shuffle music, what they really 
want is an equal spread of artists 
and genres over the course of the 
listening experience. If someone 
has a playlist with Kanye West, 
Prince, Lou Reed (who knows 
why you would), that person 
would not want to listen to 10 
songs from the same artist in a 

row. Instead, they would want 
about three songs from each 
artist over the course of the ten 
songs.

For lovers of Apple Music, 

don’t worry — they have also 
adopted a similar mechanism of 
somewhat non-totally random 
shuffling. 
Yet, 
despite 
this 

intensive manipulation of the 
algorithm and how it aligns 
with the human psyche, I can’t 
help but find myself frustrated 
with the shuffle button. It often 
seems like songs deeper into the 
playlist don’t get played, and for 
some long playlists, I do want 
to hear the same song twice 
in a listening session. What’s 
interesting about this is that 
it would be easy for Spotify to 
offer users the ability to select 

from different types of shuffling 
in the settings. Yet there is no 
customization feature, on any 
platform, for how the shuffling 
works.

While a certain part of me 

wants to reject the idea that 
tech companies like Spotify 
have the ability to understand 
how the human mind perceives 
randomness, I must admit that I 
would not want to hear the same 
song twice in a row on a shuffle 
playlist. Yet I still find myself 
feeling like the current algorithm 
is not random enough. It feels too 
calculated and cautious.

All of this manipulation of 

how shuffling works is indicative 
of a much larger trend going on 
in the tech world. Often times, 
tech companies are viewed as 
providing us with products that 
serve a function that seems to 
exist in a semi-objective way. 
Technology often hides under 
science’s guise of objectivity. 
For 
example, 
the 
order 
of 

Google search results, how your 
newsfeed (on any social media 
platform) is created, and even 
the infrastructure necessary to 
make the internet function is 
all hidden, obscured and made 
to seem a basic necessity rather 
than a privilege.

Tech companies no longer 

design their products to solve a 
problem, such as finding a piece 
of information. Their aims have 
extended much further. Now the 
information must be presented 
in 
the 
prettiest 
and 
most 

convenient way possible. Much 
of the consumer tech world is 
dominated by design decisions 
that attempt to profit off the 
functions of the human psyche. 
Shuffle play is a “fake random” 
button that manipulates how 
our 
brains 
function, 
which 

underscores a more interesting 
story 
about 
what 
makes 

consumer tech succeed.

As the saying goes, you can’t 
always get what you want. 
It’s hard for something to be 
great every time. Sometimes, 
sights are set too high. That is 
exactly what happened with 
Buoys, the latest release from 
Noah Lennox, more widely 
known as Panda Bear. That 
is not to say that the album is 
bad. It’s actually very good, 
but something is off.
In his sixth album, Panda 
Bear, co-founding member 
of Animal Collective and 
frequent 
solo 
act, 
tries 
something new. Gone are 
the days of humongous, lush 
soundscapes and curious lead 
samples. On Buoys, he only 
utilizes his highly processed 
voice, 
swampy 
basslines, 
compressed 
synthesizers, 
an acoustic guitar and the 
occasional 
sound 
sample. 
It’s a strange combination 
of sounds, but for the most 
part, it works. The looped 
guitar 
licks 
nestle 
with 
bubbling bass while the synth 
strikes veer anywhere and 
everywhere with no regard. 
It sounds disorienting, not 
in a nauseating way, but a 
hypnotizing 
one. 
Singles 
“Dolphins” and “Token” are 
instances where this effect 
is executed flawlessly. They 
sound like the listener is 
swimming through a highly 

viscous fluid where sounds 
travel just a little too fast. 
It’s mesmerizing. In fact, it is 
almost fascinating to hear.
All of Buoys unfolds like 
this, and it’s great. However, 
it 
also 
leaves 
listeners 
wanting more. Lennox is a 
little too deep in his own zone 
with this album. It sounds 
like he found the exact sound 
he wanted for the album, 
then 
refused 
to 
explore 
other 
soundscapes. 
Album 
standout “Inner Monologue” 

is the only song to break the 
mold. The song begins with 
a vocal sample of a woman’s 
trembling 
voice, 
which 
is 
soon joined by a droning horn 
blast and a meandering guitar. 
Shortly after, Lennox’s voice 
replaces the horn blasts, and 
the song erupts into a flurry 
of sound. It is unlike any 
other song, both on the album 

and elsewhere in the industry. 
“Inner 
Monologue” 
serves 
as an example as to why it 
is so important to diversify 
within the album’s set sound. 
It yields absolutely fantastic 
results.

However, 
“Inner 

Monologue” is the exception, 
not the rule. The other songs 
on Buoys just do not live up to 
the standards that previous 
Panda Bear releases set forth. 
While 
albums 
like 
Person 
Pitch and Tomboy both alter 
and contort their sound in 
different ways with each 
subsequent 
song, 
Buoys 
allows its sound to steep to 
the point of stagnation. It is 
admirable that Lennox tried 
this new sound, that much 
is certain, but he merely 
evolves his own sound rather 
than expanding upon it.
All in all, Buoys is a 
wonderful 
collection 
of 
songs. The issue is that 
the highs are few and far 
between. Aside from the 
album’s sound as a whole, 
no individual song takes a 
step outside of the realm 
of the expected. Buoys just 
does not thrill. It doesn’t 
disappoint, but there is such 
little 
diversity 
that 
it 
is 
hard to be satisfied upon the 
album’s 
completion. 
Panda 
Bear has opened the door 
for an intriguing new sound, 
but for the most part, Buoys 
leaves listeners with a craving 
for something that isn’t there.

You certainly can’t accuse 
“Happy Death Day 2U” of 
wasting its time. No sooner have 
viewers been dropped back into 
the world of the surprise 2017 
slasher hit than the story picks 
up with a new day, a new time 
loop and a new killer in a baby 
mask. Lest this all start to sound 
a little too familiar, “Happy 
Death Day 2U” 
pulls 
off 
one 
twist by signaling 
early 
on 
that 
this is no longer 
a horror movie. 
Oh, there’s still 
a 
knife-wielding 
psychopath 
on 
the 
loose, 
but 
that’s 
more 
a 
pesky annoyance 
this time around. 
Instead, 
with 
a 
story 
centering 
on 
the 
multiverse and time travel and 
a host of other pseudo-science 
mumbo jumbo, it embraces the 
silliness at the core of its premise 
and plays as an out-and-out sci-fi 
comedy.
I can respect the daringness 
it would take to genre-hop like 
that — it’s the sort of move that 
a lot of series wouldn’t even 
think of making — even if the 
movie itself never lives up to 
that initial shock to the system. 
Instead it ties itself in knots, 
layering one sci-fi trope on top 

of another and drowning an 
underdeveloped A-plot in a wash 
of underdeveloped B-plots. The 
idea at its core isn’t so much 
“less is more” as it is “no, more is 
more, stupid,” so it jettisons the 
simple efficiency of the original 
film in favor of a surprisingly 
confusing story that all too 
rarely gives you something to 
hold on to in the midst of all the 
madness. Instead, true to the 
fast-paced opening scenes, it 
never stops moving, never stops 

hitting you over the head with 
nonsense, because to stop would 
be to admit there’s no substance 
and lose your attention.
This reaches an infuriating 
extreme in the third act, which 
features enough genre-bending 
for an entire franchise, let alone 
a single film. By this point, every 
character arc has either been 
finished or dropped entirely, 
so as “Happy Death Day 2U” 
moves from the sci-fi insanity 
of the rest of the film to a heist 
sequence to the twisty finale of 
the slasher subplot with all the 

grace of a dying animal, it plays 
more as padding than anything 
else. It’s hard to care about any 
of this to begin with — especially 
the slasher stuff that the script 
seems to forget more often than 
not — but without any character 
growth to ground itself in, it 
feels especially extraneous.
The one undeniably bright 
spot is Jessica Rothe (“Forever 
My Girl”) returning as Tree. 
What few laughs are to be had 
mostly come from her righteous 
fury at having to 
relive 
Monday 
the 
18th 
again 
after 
already 
having done so 11 
times, as well as 
the general hard-
edged charm she 
exudes in every 
single scene and 
the few dramatic 
moments 
that 
work do so for 
the same reason. 
Rothe’s work is always grounded 
in something human while the 
rest of the film all too rarely 
is. Even in the movie’s worst 
moments (the aforementioned 
endless third act) it’s easy to 
return to her performance and 
find something enjoyable. If 
there were ever any doubt that 
the superstar in the making is 
the glue holding this nascent 
franchise together — and if 
you saw the original, for all its 
merits, there shouldn’t be — then 
if nothing else, “Happy Death 
Day 2U” should serve as its cure.

‘Happy Death Day’ swaps

Universal Pictures

Rolling Stone declared 2018 
“a year of nineties obsessions.” 
We’re one month into 2019, and 
our cultural fixation on the 
’90s — the clothing, the movies, 
the music — looks as though 
it’s finding its footing, not 
losing steam. This phenomenon 
is 
strongest 
among 
college 
students, I think; people who 
were born in the 1990s but have 
no memory of it. My friends and 
I take pictures of each other 
with disposable cameras; we 
part our hair down the middle 

and wear giant jackets and it 
makes us feel cool. The nineties 
happened just recently enough 
that we’re able to fetishize 
those years in a way that feels 
accurate but isn’t, and this is 
part of the appeal. It can be 
anything we want it to be.
We’re curating a version 
of the ‘90s for ourselves to 
live through, and to do so we 
punctuate the soundtrack of our 
days with the music of the era — 
Run-D.M.C., Melissa Etheridge, 
Blondie, 
the 
B-52s. 
These 
are the conditions in which 
I was first exposed to Sinéad 
O’Connor. She showed up on 
my Spotify Weekly playlist in 

early January, a decidedly non-
analog introduction. Suddenly 
it was 1990 again, the first year 
of a decade whose complexities 
I was born too late to remember, 
whose decadent simplicity is so 
very appealing.
Sinéad 
O’Connor 
is 
an 
enduring mystery. Her career 
has taken sharp turns and 
unexpected detours, her public 
persona shifting from brave 
to bizarre and back again. 
In the ‘90s she became an 
international icon with her 
shaved head, dark eyebrows 
and weird outfits. She built a 
reputation as a badass Irish 
pixie, someone who relished 

voicing unpopular opinions.
In 1992, years before abuse in 
the Catholic church was widely 
discussed, O’Connor tore up a 
picture of the Pope on Saturday 
Night Live and told a shocked 
and silent live audience 
to “fight the real enemy.” 
On tour in the United 
States, 
she 
stirred 
controversy for refusing 
to sing if the national 
anthem 
was 
played 
before 
her 
concerts. 
O’Connor 
has 
always 
embraced contradiction. 
She’s a loud feminist 
in 
baggy 
clothes, 
an 
unmarried mother, an 
angry radical, a sexy pop 
star.
“You know that I can 
thrill you,” she sings on 
“I Want Your (Hands 
on Me).” “I want you, 
call me to you / I wanna 
move, will you? I really 
wanna feel you.” She 
pivots to police brutality 
on 
“Black 
Boys 
on 
Mopeds”: 
“England’s 
not the mythical land 
of Madame George and 
roses / It’s the home of 
police who kill black 
boys on mopeds.” She 
wants sex; she wants 
a more just world; she 
wants love but forgets 
how to give it.
This is the Sinéad of 
1990’s “I Do Not Want 
What I Haven’t Got,” her 
second and most well-
known album. In the 
music video for “Nothing 
Compares 2 U,” she is beautiful 
and mad in a black turtleneck. 
Her voice rises sharply and 
then drops to a whisper: a 
wounded 
bird, 
a 
wounded 
woman. “I could put my arms 
around every boy I see / But 

they’d only remind me of you,” 
she sings, the camera zoomed 
in on her pale, angular face, and 
you believe every word she says.
Then there’s the strange, 
darker Sinéad, the one who 

cried and ran offstage at a Bob 
Dylan tribute concert, who 
wrote an open letter to Miley 
Cyrus telling her to dress more 
conservatively, who said Prince 
punched her over her cover 
of “Nothing Compares 2 U.” 

Similarly unsettling incidents 
pepper recent news coverage 
of O’Connor. In 2016, she went 
missing but was later found 
safe, riding her bicycle around 
a suburb of Chicago. She briefly 
had two face tattoos. She 
appeared on Dr. Phil for a 
televised therapy session 
about her mother. When 
she converted to Islam 
in 
2018, 
she 
legally 
changed her name to 
Shuhada’ Davitt. These 
incidents cast O’Connor 
as both vulnerable and 
volatile, an artist whose 
actions 
are 
directed 
by 
some 
unknowable 
combination of mental 
illnesses, 
childhood 
traumas and a frustrated 
excess of talent.
This is all to say that 
listening to “I Do Not 
Want What I Haven’t 
Got” 29 years after its 
release is an experience 
that cannot be divorced 
from 
the 
person 
O’Connor has become 
in the intervening time. 
Here lies the persistent 
difficulty of nostalgia: 
We know how it all 
turned out. But does 
that really matter, when 
our current infatuation 
with the ‘90s is so fun? 
It’s a relief to revisit 
the 
cultural 
artifacts 
of an era that seems far 
less dangerous than the 
current one.
“Whatever 
it 
may 
bring / I will live by my 
own policies / I will sleep with 
a clear conscience / I will sleep 
in peace,” O’Connor sings on 
“The Emperor’s New Clothes.” 
With that fuck-off attitude, her 
placid anarchy: I just want to 
keep listening.

a LATTE

When I was much younger, I 
thought my family’s annual “The 
Sound of Music” Christmas tradition 
was very dumb. We didn’t celebrate 
Christmas, so when ABC Family 
rolled out its holiday programming, 
we’d record the 1965 classic on our 
DVR, watch about an hour of the 
film each night over the course of 
a few days, and bask in the joy of 
every damn word of “My Favorite 
Things.” By the time I headed to the 
University of Michigan, every fiber 
of that movie had become ingrained 
into my existence, for better or for 
worse.
Fast forward to this past spring: I 
had spent three program-structured 
days in Vienna, Austria, and I now 
had a full day to explore. I had 
recently been made aware of the 
eminent accessibility of “The Sound 
of Music” tour in Salzburg. It sounded 
like a lock, but finding company for 
the cross-country trek would prove 
difficult. I asked my roommate if he 
had any interest in going.
“I need to get a haircut,” said 
Derek. “And there’s also an all-you-
can-eat sushi place across the street.”
I thought the movie buffs we’d 
befriended would take the bait. Not 
so much.
“Uh… no,” said Will.
Eli too.
“Sorry dude.”
There’d be no hesitation on my end. 
I booked my train and tour tickets, 
party of one, while at an evening wine 
and cheese tasting. Auf wiedersehen, 
future FOMO-havers.

— 

Upon arriving in Salzburg, I felt… 
out of place. Everyone was extremely 
good-looking, and they were all 
wearing pastel-colored dress shirts, 
a stark contrast from my t-shirt and 
jogger sweatpant getup. Alas: After a 
quick beef chili bowl, I was ready to 
see the hills come alive.
At the tour bus meeting point I was 
greeted by a really cheerful tour guide 

named Eva, who was from Uruguay 
and really, really, really, loved “The 
Sound of Music.” I took a seat by 
the window — a strategic decision — 
and prayed I’d win the random new 
friend lottery. Soon after, another 
solo traveler, a 50-ish-year-old South 
Korean man named Roy, took the 

seat next to me. He explained that 
he’d found a ton of success in global 
software 
investment, 
and 
even 
though he used a bunch of terms that 
flew way over my head, I gathered 
generally that he was celebrating his 
life victory with a solo trip around 
the world. He exuded unadulterated 
joy.
Joy 
— 
that’s 
what 
brought 
everyone to Salzburg. “The Sound of 
Music” should be everything I hate 
in a movie — it’s next-level sappy 
and cliché — but it’s about good guys 
beating bad guys, family, love and 
figuring out what brings you joy. And 
it includes the waterworks factory 
that is “Edelweiss.” There’s no telling 
how the movie brings together a solo 
American college student and the 
wine-friendly, tattoo-sleeved young 
Australian surferbros who sat in 
the back of the bus and drained out 
Eva’s informational snippets with a 
deafening “Oye aim sixtain GOWING 
awn saiventaind,” all while making 
me secondhand drunk. It just does.
That kind of uncapturable magic 
is why describing the tour itself 

is 
impossible 
and 
maybe 
even 
unimportant. It was incredible, of 
course, seeing with my own two eyes 
the Mirabell Gardens and Hellbrunn 
Palace, the very images that at a 
young age fortified a soul-defining 
indoctrination. But the sightseeing, 
on its own, doesn’t capture “The 
Sound of Music”’s essence, nor should 
it have to. The people were enough.

— 

Still, what I’ll remember most from 
the excursion is the train ride back 
to Vienna. I’d say it was the most 
perfect three hours of my entire life 
— and it was — but even that wouldn’t 
do the experience justice. It was 
transcendent. The sunset gleamed 
off those Austrian foothills with rays 
that were so majestic that I began 
to question if Julie Andrews had 
telepathically transmitted some sort 
of happiness serum into my freshly 
Berlin-ed, emo-charred insides. I 
could only attempt to alleviate my 
otherworldly emotion with periodic 
tosses of Haribo candies into my 
mouth, but I had a smile on my face 
so gosh darn big that the gummy 
bears just kind of popped back out 
onto my seat as if I was some kind 
of broken automated puppet. To the 
spooked German toddlers that were 
seated across the aisle: If you’re 
reading this, I apologize. I am sane 
and stable, and I even write about 
health and wellness for my university 
newspaper. In America!
Here I am, back in America. 
There’s a lot more stress and zero 
Austrian foothills. Now I often find 
myself wondering if Favorite Things 
are meant to be enjoyed in rare, if 
not fleeting, glimpses. It’s a question 
I might need many years worth of 
maturity to properly answer. For 
the time being, however, I do know 
this: For one day, in those winding 
hills of Mondsee, among the drunk 
Aussies and Roy the South Korean 
investment magnate, I had found my 
own little slice of heaven.

The Austrian foothills: 
otherwise, my own mecca

The past few years have 
witnessed a significant rise 
in streetwear. Actually, more 
than just significant — it 
has been a colossal wave 
that hit the fashion industry 
and does not show any 
intentions of stopping. This 
style is often characterized 
by 
casual 
clothing 
and 
bright colors, inspired from 
skatewear, and has its roots 
in various parts of the world, 
from Japan to Britain to 
California. It is undeniable 
that streetwear has evolved 
over generations, and what 
started as something that 
was equated with cheap and 
easily accessible clothing for 
everyone; however, society’s 
youth 
is 
now 
morphing 
into the exact opposite. The 
single 
underlying 
reason 
for this transformation is 
the unfortunate integration 
of street style with luxury 
brands and high fashion.
The integration between 
the two seemingly polar 
concepts begin with the 
collaboration between Louis 
Vuitton and Supreme, along 
with the sudden surge in 
the popularity of names like 
Vetements and Balenciaga. 
Brands such as Louis Vuitton 
have for the longest time been 
known as symbols of not only 
wealth, but also markers to 
distinguish and elevate the 
meaning of “couture.” These 
names represent decades of 
the history of fashion and 
have always taken pride in 

the fact that they do not seem 
to follow the herd. However, 
I believe their recent work 
with streetwear screams the 
contrary.
I do not deny that the 
style has become so much 
more than just a trend — 
it has transformed into a 
culture that is ubiquitous, but 
eccentric at the same time. But 
the fact that a culture is shared 
by a massive group of people 
reflects an ideology that is 
larger than a single person 
or trend. More importantly, 
fashion has always helped 
bind communities and help 
translate that sentiment of 
belonging into an appearance, 
but the injection of luxury 
into this culture is creating 
an increasingly wide gap. 
There is now a group that 
partakes in the propagation 
of the style, not because they 
are emotionally attached to it, 
but because it has become the 
new cool thing. The division 
is a crack that soon will not 
be able to be filled and will 
radically change both worlds.
Names like Burberry and 
Chanel that are now visibly 
shifting to a more trendy 
image have always been 
associated with pieces of 
fashion that are in fact pieces 
of art on the runway. More 
importantly, these brands 
are synonymous with classy 
dressing that reflects the 
rich heritage of the brand. 
By merging with streetwear, 
they are no longer doing 
justice to either of the sides. 
At the end of the day, the 
streetwear domain should 

be dominated by those firms 
that share its culture and 
history, and luxury names do 
not fall in those categories. 
On the other hand, I also fear 
that companies like Burberry 
could end up losing their 
essence and it factor, the 
sense of elusiveness projected 
by their designs, shows and 
retail experience. If luxury 
names continue to merge 
and expand into numerous 
styles and areas, this sense of 
exclusivity would eventually 
fade.
Don’t get me wrong — 
I have no problem with 
streetwear as a style. There 
have been times where I too 
engage and advocate for it, 
but I don’t want to advocate 
for the mixing of ideas that 
do not share a common story. 
Fashion is more than just 
clothing: It is the expression 
of a sentiment. It is the telling 
of a tale, and to do so without 
truly belonging to that sub 
domain is diminishing the 
importance of the human and 
societal aspect to fashion.
Yes, the Chanel high tops 
sneakers and Gucci hoodies 
that spell “I am trendy 
but I can also afford the 
apparently finer things of 
life” are enticing. There has 
been a point in most of our 
lives where we want to wear 
the branded, yet common 
clothes. However, isn’t the 
very point of streetwear to be 
something that can be shared 
by everyone? Luxury clothing 
isn’t meant to echo these 
ideas. It’s time that we stop 
trying to mix oil and water.

Streetwear and luxury: 
Should they still mix?

Yoga is a strange art. 
Strangers 
sharing 
a 
communal space, yet finding 
privacy in the four corners 
of our yoga mats. Some hate 
it with a burning passion, 
others get a rush from it. 
There is no in between. I 
fall into the latter category. 
Instead of trying to come up 
with reasons of why all the 
yoga haters out there should 
give it a second chance, it’s 
probably more interesting to 
tell a love story (fitting, since 
Valentine’s Day just passed). 
This is the love story of me 
and yoga.
My relationship with yoga 
first started in high school. A 
combination of stresses led 
me to develop an extremely 
unhealthy relationship with 
my physical body and my 
mind. I went to a performing 
arts high school in New York 
City, where I was trapped 
in a cinder block building 
for 12 hours at a time due 
to long rehearsal schedules 
and 
performance 
classes 
that extended our academic 
school day. I would commute 
on the subway in the morning 
at very early hours and back 
home late at night, getting 
little to no hours of daylight.

Being 
a 
professional 
performer, it is easy to fall 
into a cycle of self-loathing 
and self-hate, as we are 
constantly 
being 
judged 
and hired for our looks and 
talents. As a woman of color 
in the performing industry, 
I faced unique challenges 
in the performing world. 
I began to scrutinize my 
body, the way that my curves 
looked in a tight leotard, the 
fact that my singing voice 
sounded “princess-ey” and 
“white,” 
further 
limiting 
the roles I would be able 
to be cast in. I developed a 
disconnect with my body, 
choosing to ignore my curves 
and tan skin and detach 
my mind from my body in 
hopes that I would feel more 
content. Of course, this was 
not the case. I ended up 
developing a very hateful 
relationship with myself. I let 
the voices of those who put 
me down merge into my own 
voice, and I felt lost as to how 
to find my own voice again.
Junior year of high school, 
I opted to take yoga as my 
gym credit. I heard it was 
easy, and that we even got 
to sleep once a week during 
class! I did not expect to 
be impacted in the way I 
was. Yoga gave me the gift 
of 
breath. 
Even 
though 
breath is a crucial part of 

singing, I did not realize 
the importance of breath in 
everyday life, calming my 
anxieties and connecting my 
mind to my body. It was the 
key to a healthier attitude 
and 
a 
healthier 
mind. 
By using breath to move 
through postures, I was able 
to better connect with my 
body. I became more aware 
of the subtleties of my body 
movements, which improved 
my dance and performance 
technique. My body was 
no longer a foreign object 
to me. It became familiar, 
and I grew to be more 
comfortable in my own skin. 
I began taking ownership of 
my body, listening to it and 
nurturing it by making sure 
I eat healthy foods, even 
though it was easier to just 
order a plate of greasy fries to 
rehearsal. I became a happier 
person, and I was eager to 
explore my body and mind 
further.
Meditation is also a crucial 
part of my yoga practice, as 
my mind flies at 100 miles per 
hour at any given moment of 
the day. Without meditation, 
I am not sure I would have 
left high school with mental 
composure.

‘M’ tops Dartmouth, 11-10, in 3OT

As time ran down in the first 
overtime period, Molly Garrett 
took an open shot in front and 
missed wide. She immediately 
went down with an injury.
Less than 5 minutes later, the 
junior midfielder was back on 
the field. Forty-eight seconds 
into the second overtime period, 
she had the same opportunity, 
but this time she converted for 
her fourth goal of the season, 
breaking the tie and giving the 
Michigan 
women’s 
lacrosse 
team (4-0) an 11-10 win over 
Dartmouth (0-2).
“I was kind of just putting my 
head down saying ‘This one’s 
mine, this one’s for the team,’ ” 
Garrett said.
While 
Garrett’s 
heroics 
decided 
the 
game, 
the 
Wolverines 
seemed 
to 
pull 
away with 15 minutes left in 
the second half. They came out 
of halftime strong, scoring five 
goals in the first 15 minutes of 
the second half to take a 10-7 
lead. Sophomore attacker Caitlin 
Muir was a big reason for this, 
scoring one goal and assisting 
on two early in the half thanks 
to her stellar play behind the 
Dartmouth goal.
Additionally, 
Michigan’s 

play in the draw circle greatly 
improved in the second half. 
After controlling just four of 
11 draws in the first half, the 
Wolverines controlled the first 
five of the second half, and only 
lost one in the first 15 minutes. 
When they were winning draws, 
they were at their best.
“Draw controls were huge,” 
said Michigan coach Hannah 
Nielsen. “The Dartmouth draw 
girl is extremely talented and we 
won the battle 15-10 there.”
After a strong start to the 
half, Michigan let Dartmouth 
back into the game but could 
have put them away with better 
offensive play down the stretch. 
The Wolverines led by three 
with less than nine minutes 
to play in regulation when a 
turnover by senior defenseman 
Gabby Burns and a foul by junior 
defenseman 
Quinn 
Melidona 
led to a Dartmouth goal on the 
advantage, cutting the lead to 
10-8.
Michigan’s defense recovered 
after the goal, but its offense 
never did. In the final eight 
minutes 
of 
regulation, 
the 
Wolverines turned the ball over 
three times, committed four 
fouls, and earned two yellow 
cards. Senior goalkeeper Mira 
Shane and the defense bailed 
them out, making big saves and 

forcing Dartmouth turnovers, 
but eventually, the sloppy play 
caught up with them. The 
Big Green scored on two free 
position shots in the final 1:47, 
tying the game at 10-10 and 
forcing overtime.
“I think it was just youth and 
inexperience in close games 
from 
our 
offense,” 
Nielsen 
said. “We had times where our 
defense was getting us back the 
ball and we were taking the first 
option or just taking less than 
90-plus percent opportunities.”
Even though Dartmouth came 
back, the Wolverines showed 
resiliency in overtime. They 
continued to play hard so they 
wouldn’t lose a game that they 
seemed to have control of late in 
the second half, culminating in 
Garrett’s game-winner.
Now 4-0 after two wins this 
weekend, Michigan is off to 
its best start in the history of 
the program. While there are 
still improvements to be made, 
winning close games like this 
will be extremely beneficial as 
the season progresses.
“I think it shows how mature 
we are and how we’ve grown as 
a program and how we’re able 
to handle that and have those 
people out there to keep each 
other calm, cool, collected,” 
Garrett said. “We can handle it.”

Junior midfielder Molly Garrett scored the double-overtime goal to give Michigan an 11-10 victory over Dartmouth.

Connection between Zavier Simpson and Jon Teske fuels Wolverines

Zavier Simpson bided his time, 
wrapping 
behind 
the 
basket 
before splitting two defenders 
with a no-look bounce pass. Just 
as the pass reached its apex, 
Jon Teske came streaking into 
the lane, collected the ball and 
emphatically slammed it home, 
giving Michigan a double-digit 
lead it would never relinquish.
That scene came late in the 
second half of the Wolverines’ 
65-52 win over Maryland on 
Saturday, but it’s emblematic 
of a larger trend that has come 
to define their offense over the 

past three months. Simpson — 
Michigan’s offensive conductor 
— leads all Big 
Ten point guards 
in 
assist-to-
turnover 
rate, 
while Teske has 
flourished as its 
interior linchpin, 
averaging 
10.7 
points 
and 
6.9 
rebounds 
in 
conference play.
“A 
little 
bit 
under-recruited 
guys that came in with a little edge 
about them,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “A lot of people 
doubted whether they maybe 

could play at Michigan, either one 
of them. And I love the way they 
work 
together. 
They really have a 
great feel for each 
other.”
Early last year, 
the 
chemistry 
between 
the 
two 
would 
have 
appeared 
completely 
foreign. 
Teske 
played 
just 
12 
minutes a game, 
while Simpson was still finding his 
foothold in a three-headed point 
guard rotation.
This summer, that all changed. 

Simpson had already emerged 
as the exemplification of the 
Wolverines’ hard-
nosed identity, but 
Teske’s offseason 
was filled with 
questions 
of 
whether 
he 
could 
replace 
the 
departed 
Moritz 
Wagner. 
In October, when 
Beilein expressed 
his confidence in 
Teske to replace 
Wagner’s 3-point production, it 
was met with a justified skepticism 
— Teske had attempted just two 
threes in his first two seasons in 

Ann Arbor and missed both.
But those within the program 
knew better.
“Aw 
man, 
they were doing 
that at pickup,” 
said 
sophomore 
forward 
Isaiah 
Livers, referring 
to the unofficial 
scrimmages 
players hold over 
the summer to 
keep 
up 
their 
conditioning 
before official practices start in 
October.
Ask Teske himself and you’ll get 
an answer that goes even further 
back.
“I’d say (it developed) as soon 
as we got on campus,” Teske said 
after he and Simpson combined 
for 41 points in a win over 
Northwestern last month. “We 
came in as freshmen together, so 
we’ve been through a lot of ups 
and a lot of downs.”
No matter what answer you get, 
the consensus is a distinct lack of 
surprise.
And with the 
rest of Michigan’s 
starting 
five 
finding 
their 
share of offensive 
travails 
over 
the 
past 
few 
months, 
the 
pair’s consistency 
has been among 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defining 
strengths.
“The ‘5’ man and point guard 
have to have a really good 
connection on the court as well,” 
said sophomore guard Jordan 
Poole. “Cause everything kinda 
runs through them. And being 
able to have a big man who 
controls everything how he does 
in the middle and being able to 
have (Simpson) lead how he does 
from the point guard position is 
huge.”
On the rare occasions that 
Teske and Simpson don’t shine, 
the results are obvious. When 

Maryland cut a 15-point deficit to 
three midway through the second 
half Saturday, Teske’s offense was 
a major culprit, as he made just 
1-of-10 shots over the opening 35 
minutes.
Then, Simpson, as he so often 
does, sprung his center open 
for consecutive baskets, part of 
a two-minute stretch in which 
Teske singlehandedly outscored 
the Terrapins, 7-2, extending 
Michigan’s lead from six to eleven 
and effectively icing the game.
It’s not just that Maryland 
game, either. The pair’s bond 
has shone through in all of the 
Wolverines’ most impressive wins 
— Simpson last failed to assist 
Teske in a game on Jan. 22 against 
Minnesota.
“It allows him to play — pop, 
roll, slip, do anything he can do,” 
Simpson said. “And it opens up not 
just for himself but also for others 
so that’s always good.”
Just like on the court, Teske’s 
answer is on the same page.
“He always knows where I am 
on the court and I know he’ll make 
the right decision 
and 
the 
right 
pass for me to 
go finish,” Teske 
said. “And he has 
the 
confidence 
in me to go finish 
around the rim or 
pick and pop and 
shoot the three.”
So when Teske 
streaks 
to 
the 
basket off a feed 
from his point guard, it can be 
easy to forget the questions that 
surrounded him just four months 
ago.
But then he’ll set a screen for 
Simpson at the top of the arc and, 
when his defender cheats off him, 
pop out beyond the 3-point line 
to nail a three. And each time, it 
will elicit some sort of surprise 
from the uninitiated, reminding 
Michigan fans of the doubt they 
used to carry.
Teske 
and 
his 
teammates, 
though? They knew this was 
coming all the way.

For Lambert, a vision falls into place

When Denver’s Brett Stapley 
finessed the puck past two 
defenders and the goaltender for 
the overtime goal to beat North 
Dakota on Feb. 2, Michigan 
freshman 
forward 
Jimmy 
Lambert tweeted a compliment 
for his former teammate.
The two played together on 
the same line for three years in 
the British Columbia Hockey 
League. And for all the skill and 
talent Stapley exhibited, the 
show never got old for Lambert, 
who 
had 
“front-row 
seats.” 
Lambert, however, put on a 
show of his own, scoring 142 
points through his three-year 
stay with the Vernon Vipers 
— the team for which the two 
played.
Lambert 
was 
born 
in 
Saskatoon, 
Saskatchewan, 
Canada. His grandfather started 
taking Lambert ice skating at 
the age of two. Going to public 
ice sessions offered at his local 
rink, his grandfather taught him 
how to skate, bit by bit, until 
Lambert reached four when he 
was given his first mini-hockey 
stick.
Then, Lambert took off and 
sought to perfect his craft 
through the junior league. He 
moved to British Columbia and 
joined the Vipers after three 
years in Saskatoon’s midget 
league. There, under Vernon’s 
coach Mark Ferner, Lambert 
developed into a better player in 
all aspects.
“The program there was 
awesome,” Lambert said. “Mark 
Ferner, our coach, he really 
helped me develop as a player, on 
both sides of the puck. He’s very 
understandings of how players 
play the game and really wants 
them to get to the next level.
“That’s the goal of junior 
hockey, that’s to help players 
get scholarships and he’s done 
that for many years with his job 
in Vernon. He’s sent multiple 
players to (the) NCAA, and 
he’s very good at developing 
players.”
Ferner, a two-time BCHL 
coach of the year, had a keen 

understanding of not only the 
game but his roster as well. 
Lambert’s game is built on 
speed, puck control and, most 
importantly, vision. Pitting him 
with a skill-based player like 
Stapley complemented his style 
and the two led the team to two 
division finals and a semifinal.
From there, Lambert reached 
junior hockey. He moved up 
to the NCAA. When Michigan 
came calling, he didn’t hesitate 
to accept.
“I definitely can say, if you’re 
going to school in Canada, you’re 
not going to be getting the same 
things we’re getting here for 
sure,” Lambert joked.
But the collegiate level proved 
to be a taller task than initially 
expected. With only four games 
left in the regular season, 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson 
noted that despite the strides 
he’s made so far, Lambert has a 
long way to go.
“He’s 
just 
learning 
what 
it takes to be a good player,” 
Pearson said. “Just an average 
player at this level.”
Through 25 games, Lambert 
has just totaled eight points, 
starkly contrasting the prior 
year, when he had 61 points in 
55 games in the BCHL and was 
top-20 in point totals of the 
entire league.
“He’s got to play stronger on 
the puck, he’s got to play faster on 
the puck, he’s got to handle the 
puck better, he’s got to release it 
quicker,” Pearson said. “I think 
that reflects in his numbers a 
little bit. He’s on the power play, 
and he gets a little good shake on 
a regular line, but his numbers 

don’t blow you away. But it’s an 
adjustment. And I don’t know if 
he was totally prepared for the 
adjustment that it takes.”
Pearson 
has 
implored 
Lambert to take things more 
seriously, through preparation 
for games or practices. There 
are many different routines or 
styles of hockey — different ways 
to play, practice or prepare. As 
Pearson puts it, Lambert’s yet to 
find his own.
But he has started to put 
things together.
“I’m 
working 
on 
making 
sure I’m a little better in the 
defensive zone,” Lambert said. 
“And I like to think I have some 
offensive upside, definitely need 
to start putting the puck in the 
net a little bit more.”
It’s clear what Lambert’s 
strengths 
are. 
Despite 
his 
numbers on the stat sheets 
being limited, the ones on there 
have been created by his speed 
and vision. Knowing not only 
where his teammates are, but 
his opponents as well, he likes 
to keep tabs on all the players 
on the ice at all times. Marked, 
unmarked, open or contested, 
he’ll know and make the play 
with the puck to get the best 
shot available.
“He’s got a good knowledge of 
the game, good hockey sense,” 
Pearson said. “Gets up and down 
pretty good, and he’s got some of 
the intangibles you look for in a 
player. I think he’s a good team 
guy, I know he’s a good team 
guy.”
Even if Lambert hasn’t yet put 
it all together, he has the vision 
that will allow it soon.

Adam Steinberg sat in his office, 
feet up on his desk, and consid-
ered a tradeoff that would alter the 
trajectory of his coaching career 
and tennis legacy. The June 2014 
calendar on his wall seemed like a 
ticking time bomb.
As Steinberg leaned back in his 
chair, he pondered swapping the 
soft sand of Malibu’s beaches for 
Ann Arbor’s brutal winters. He 
weighed the prospect of leaving 
the national powerhouse he es-
tablished as the head coach of the 
Pepperdine men’s tennis program 
— where he was sitting on a 265-92 
record over 13 years — for Michi-
gan, which hadn’t advanced past 
the second round of the NCAA 
Tournament since 2008.
While contemplating this, it oc-
curred to Steinberg that the 
change of scenery would amount 
to much more than just leaving 
palm trees in his past.
As his eyes wandered around his 
office, Steinberg recalled some of 
his greatest achievements during 
his memorable tenure with the 
Waves. An NCAA championship 
banner, 2006 National Coach of 
the Year plaque and over a decade’s 
worth of team photos dangled 
from the wall — enveloping Stein-
berg in the nostalgia of his most 
successful coaching stint to date. 
But when push came to shove, 
Steinberg’s competitive edge — a 
driving force in his playing days 
on Long Island and at Penn State 
— wouldn’t let the task of righting 
the ship at Michigan slip through 
the cracks.
“It was a very hard decision,” 
Steinberg said. “Pepperdine was 
special, but after being there 12 
years, I was ready for a new chal-
lenge. Not many times in your life 
does a Michigan come along with 
that combination of athletics and 
academics. It was just too good to 
pass up at that stage of my life.”
After 13 seasons, a 2006 national 
title and 10 West Coast Confer-
ence Tournament championships, 
Steinberg called Pepperdine Di-
rector of Athletics Steve Potts to 
inform him of his decision.
With that, he punched his ticket 
to Ann Arbor, where a program 
mired in mediocrity stood stag-
nant at a crossroads between con-
tention and irrelevance.
When Steinberg stepped down at 
Pepperdine, it wasn’t the first time 
he left a successful head coaching 
post in favor of a new challenge.
The first time, it was June 2002. 
A 36-year-old Steinberg had just 
wrapped up his fifth year as the 
head coach at Alabama. Under his 
tutelage, the Crimson Tide fin-
ished the season ranked inside the 
top-25 in four of five seasons.
Though Steinberg was one of the 
country’s youngest coaches at the 
time of his Pepperdine interview, 
experience was one of his strong 
suits. He became the head coach 
at St. John’s in 1990, just two years 
after the end of his playing career 
at Penn State. During his five-year 
tenure with the Red Storm, Stein-
berg guided the program to a 61-22 
overall record — highlighted by a 
conference championship in his 
debut season 

— before accepting a job as North-
western’s assistant coach after the 
1995 season. He spent two years 
there, where he helped the Wild-
cats reach the NCAA Tournament 
in 2001 and 2002.
It was at that point that Pepper-
dine Director of Athletics Dr. John 
Watson gave Steinberg a call about 
the Waves’ head coaching job.
“In the interview process, he an-
swered all the questions (the way) 
I wanted him to in tennis and stu-
dent development, but also as hu-
man beings,” Watson told The Dai-
ly in a January phone interview. 
“He was an ethical person and a 
strong leader. He has a strong per-
sonality, but he’s also compassion-
ate and understanding.
When Watson formally offered 
him the position, Steinberg looked 
him in the eye and made a guaran-
tee before even picking up his pen 
to sign the contract.
“You will have a national champi-
onship in four years.”
Sure enough, the Pepperdine play-
ers dumped a cooler of Gatorade on 
their coach after upsetting Georgia 
in the NCAA Tournament final 
four years later.
“Winning is important to him,” 
Watson said, “but not everything 
to him — he wants his players to be 
successful on the court, but more 
importantly successful in life.”
Michigan’s 
academic 
prestige, 
coupled with the camaraderie of 
its athletic pride and tradition, was 
enough to sway Steinberg to pack 
his bags.
Before he was an All-American, 
Michigan’s captain and national 
singles runner-up, 2018 gradu-
ate Alex Knight was just another 
redshirt freshman. A little more 
than a month before Steinberg 
was named the Wolverines’ head 
coach, Knight’s phone buzzed as 
a call came in from then-coach 
Bruce Berque, who recruited 
Knight and welcomed him with 
open arms as an early enrollee.
Their relationship was short lived.
After the team failed to advance 
past the second round of the 
NCAA Tournament for the sixth 
straight season, then-Athletic Di-
rector Dave Brandon decided it 
was time for a change. Berque had 
been fired, bringing his decade-
long stint in Ann Arbor to a close.
“Winning and inclusivity wasn’t 
(Berque’s) primary goal,” Knight 
said. “He would admit it too — he 
didn’t crack down on a few guys 
he should’ve. The reason for the 
(shortcomings) was a kind of 
clown culture.”
When Brandon hired Steinberg, 
his new leader embodied the 
much-needed attitude change he 
sought throughout his national 
search. As a result, Knight and his 
teammates saw their goals align 
with Steinberg’s from the start.
“After (Berque was fired), players 
wanted an environment that was 
positive, fun and hard-working,” 
Knight told The Daily three weeks 
ago. “(Steinberg) came in and said 
the exact same things, and we had 
to start from ground zero to lay the 
foundation 
for 

the program.”
With a blueprint in place, the team 
began to build.
When Steinberg joined the fold, 
Brandon also brought back Sean 
Maymi, the Wolverines’ former 
associate head coach under Ber-
que from 2006-2011. Knight cred-
its Maymi with installing the pro-
gram’s work ethic, accountability 
and precise attention to detail.
Still, Steinberg’s cultural renova-
tion didn’t yield immediate results. 
Michigan posted a 7-17 record in 
2015 — its worst season since 1992. 
Despite the poor record, the pro-
gram’s entire outlook changed.
“It was such a shock in terms of 
how far off we were from being a 
good program,” Knight said. “We 
went from, ‘You come to practice, 
you try to get away with as much 
as you can, then you leave and go 
party’ to ‘Hey, every minute of 
practice is a gift, and you need to 
come out extra, and your number 
one priority needs to be getting 
your teammate better.’ ”
Because players grow up repre-
senting only themselves at tourna-
ments and national draws, most 
struggle when they’re asked to buy 
into a team atmosphere in college.
After a lackluster season, Stein-
berg and Maymi took a creative ap-
proach when they went back to the 
drawing board. The next season, 
they put the burden of leadership 
on everybody’s shoulders by rede-
fining the role of a “captain.” All 11 
players on the roster received the 
title, and the idea made a massive 
difference on the practice court.
“When you practice, you’re not 
practicing for yourself,” Tishman 
said. “You’re focusing on getting 
your teammates better. The idea 
is that if all 11 guys are doing that, 
it’s going to come back around to 
help you. In theory, your tennis 
goes through the roof. And it has 
worked beyond words.”
The mindset took Michigan to new 
heights, as the Wolverines won 21 
matches in 2016 — a season that 
marked the team’s transformation 
from bottom feeder to contender. 
Michigan’s 14-win turnaround set 
a program record, and the entire 
roster wholeheartedly embraced 
Steinberg’s culture. By the end of 
the season, it had become an en-
during staple of the program.
“You support and play for each 
other,” Steinberg said. “It’s some-
thing bigger than yourself. (This 
program) takes the individual-
ity out of tennis, which is hard be-
cause these kids have only ever ex-
perienced playing for themselves. 
We try to create ‘team’ each day. 
I did it for 12 years at Pepperdine, 
and I’ve done it every day here.
“To me, college sports are all about 
pride and passion and playing for 
your school, so you have to show it. 
I tell (the team), ‘Never apologize 
for being passionate about some-
thing in your life.’ We don’t accept 
anything less.” Now, the passion in 
Michigan tennis is more apparent 
than ever.
“Michigan is the only 

program in the country that truly 
preaches team first,” Knight said. 
“Tennis is usually an individual-
istic sport, but college tennis is 
a completely different animal. 
(Michigan’s culture) is unique to 
Steinberg.
“He’s the best coach in the coun-
try.”
***
Just two years after Steinberg’s 
hiring, No. 24 Michigan put its 
growth to the test against sixth-
seeded Wake Forest in the second 
round of the 2016 NCAA Tourna-
ment. The Demon Deacons — who 
entered the match having already 
eclipsed the 30-win milestone — 
were widely expected to cruise 
past the Wolverines. To their sur-
prise, Michigan came out strong, 
riding its team-first philosophy to 
a hard-fought doubles point. Mo-
ments later, the Wolverines took 
fourth singles via retirement. 
Wake Forest eventually battled 
to back to complete the comeback 
on its home court, but Michigan 
boarded its flight home with no 
shortage of takeaways.
“We went right to the end with 
them,” Steinberg said. “After that, 
I could see we were really ready to 
move forward. That was a big turn-
ing point because you could see the 
guys believing they belonged for 
the first time.”
From there, the Wolverines knew 
the future was bright. With the 
infrastructure in place, Steinberg 
began to score big wins on the re-
cruiting trail.
When Steinberg gets on the phone 
with a high school prospect, the 
first topic of discussion is his pro-
gram’s culture. He knows it’s not 
for everyone, and finding the right 
puzzle pieces while recruiting is 
crucial to his team’s success.
After working with a mixture of 
Berque’s recruits and his own, 
Steinberg was finally able to bring 
in personalities that aligned with 
his philosophy. Headlined by blue-
chips Andrew Fenty and Patrick 
Maloney, Steinberg put together 
the nation’s fifth-ranked recruit-
ing class in 2018.
In Knight’s eyes, that’s the key to 
taking the next step.
“The only rebuilding that ever has 
to be done is personnel,” Knight 
said. “The culture is there — with 
that comes not only a good work 
ethic in everything you do, but 
inclusivity. When freshmen come 
in, it’s like a family — whereas be-
fore (Steinberg’s arrival) it was an 
environment of hazing and upper-
classmen being different. Now it’s 
inclusive.”
Though Knight and his classmates 
have graduated, their posters still 
hang in Ann Arbor’s Varsity Ten-
nis Center, a reminder of their 
impact on the program. By buy-
ing in from the start, Knight’s 
class paved the way.
Putting the team first 
takes sacrifice. It takes 
humility. It takes emo-
tion-

al strength. But 
above all else, it can’t be done 
without giving.
Steinberg is no stranger to that. 
After Pepperdine won the national 
championship in 2006, his players 
knocked on Dr. Watson’s door to 
call in a favor.
When the team was invited to the 
White House for a celebration, the 
players went to Watson at Stein-
berg’s request to ask if they could 
fly back two days earlier than 
scheduled. When Watson asked 
why, the players told him they 
wanted to go to an underprivi-
leged side of town and run a day-
long tennis clinic for kids.
Fresh off their championship, the 
Waves coordinated and carried 
out the children’s tennis clinic. 
After spending a humid day on 
makeshift communal courts, the 
team joined the families for din-
ner at a cluster of tattered public 
picnic tables. The parents — who 
could barely afford food for their 
own children — prepared a pot-
luck meal to express their heartfelt 
gratitude.
“They were there all day long en-
couraging those kids,” Watson 
said. “Not to become professional 
tennis players, but to understand 
the value of the sport and know 
how it can build relationships with 
other people.”
The next day, President George W. 
Bush praised the young men for 
giving back.
“That’s what champions do — they 
give back,” Bush said in a presiden-
tial address.
Though Knight will never sit in the 
Oval Office, he reflected on a simi-
lar takeaway.
“This culture teaches giving, and 
through giving you get,” Knight 
said. “The end goal with setting 
up that kind of culture wasn’t just 
to have a good tennis team, it was 
to become better men who lead 
better lives. Now we’re seeing the 
fruits of that success.”
***
Today, Steinberg’s office calendar 
marks February 2019. The Wolver-
ines — fresh off a Sweet 16 appear-
ance last season — are locked and 
loaded with talent throughout 
the roster. The synergy of 
the program’s culture and 
increasingly-talented re-
cruiting classes could 
propel Michigan to the 
same heights Steinberg 
reached at Pepperdine 
sooner rather than 
later.
“Our goal here 
is 
to 
win 
Big Ten 

championships 

and 
national 
championships,” Steinberg said. 
“That’s what Michigan is all about. 
With the support, the facilities, 
and everything else we have here, 
that has to be the goal. It was a big 
part of the allure of this job. The 
academics, the college town, the 
name, the block ‘M’ — it all means 
so much.”
Since the day Steinberg arrived, 
the team-first attitude has grown 
contagious. Once players em-
braced it as fact, wins started to 
come. They kept coming, and they 
haven’t stopped since — the Wol-
verines boast a 66-21 record over 
the last three seasons.
But unlike most of the nation’s top 
programs, Michigan isn’t operat-
ing on a title-or-bust mentality. 
Instead, winning admittedly takes 
a back seat to the program’s phi-
losophy.
“I learned selflessness and how 
rewarding it truly can be,” Knight 
said. “If you give everything, you 
get a million times more than what 
you would’ve gotten and you truly 
get better. That’s something that 
truly applies to life, to relation-
ships, to family, to random people 
on the street.
“Obviously, the goal is to win 
championships. That’s Michigan. 
But the end goal is to become bet-
ter people, and that has certainly 
changed my life.”
After 27 years of coaching, the ten-
nis court has naturally become 
Steinberg’s classroom of life. It 
may lack desks and chairs, but it 
isn’t missing the most important 
component: a teacher devoted to 
his craft.
“That’s the secret: This (culture) 
makes you a better person,” Stein-
berg said. “I feel like that’s the 
most important part of my job 
— helping these kids understand 
life’s not about ‘you’ as much as it’s 
about being unselfish, giving and 
caring about others, whether it be 
on the tennis court or anywhere 
e l s e 
in life.”
