CsgC protein in 

bacteria could help 
treat degenerative 

disorders 

By ALAINA WYGANT

For the Daily

University researchers have 

discovered CsgC, a protein made 
by the gut bacteria E. coli, which 
may one day play a role in treat-
ing dieses such as Parkinson’s or 
Alzheimer’s.

Molecular Biology Prof. Mat-

thew Chapman was a principal 
investigator on the project and 
Rackham student Margery Evans 
served as the study’s lead author, 
acting as a research assistant and 
conducted her doctorate thesis 
on the study. A number of under-
graduate students both from the 
University and abroad collabo-
rated on the research.

Chapman explained how the 

CsgC is able to prevent the forma-
tion of amyloids — inappropriate-

ly folded proteins that have been 
known to cause neurodegenera-
tive disorders such as Parkinson’s 
disease and Alzheimer’s disease.

“For decades it was thought 

that 
amyloid 
formation 
was 

always a cellular mistake,” he 
said. “We realized that cells 
sometimes build amyloid fibers 
on purpose. That is why we were 
looking for factors in E. coli that 
prevented intracellular amyloid 
formation.”

After working on the study 

for two to three years, Chapman 
and his colleagues discovered 
that CsgC, native to E. coli bac-
teria cells, guards the cells and 
prevents amyloids from forming 
inside them.

Evans emphasized the role of 

amyloid formation in diseases like 
Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, and 
said isolating CsgC is a positive 
step in treating these ailments.

“Our discoveries have moved 

the field closer to understanding 
and preventing the very wide-
spread biological process of amy-

EPA plans to cut 

carbon by 30 percent 
of 2005 levels by 2030

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

According to a University sur-

vey released earlier this month, 

67 percent of Americans sup-
port the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency’s Clean Power Plan, 
a framework for curbing carbon 
emissions.

The Center for Local, State 

and Urban Policy at the Uni-
versity’s Ford School of Public 
Policy and the Institute of Public 
Opinion at Muhlenberg College 
conducted the telephone survey 

from Oct. 6, 2014 through Nov. 
6, 2014.

Pollsters spoke with a random 

sample of 942 Americans, and 
report a 3.5 percent margin of 
error.

The Obama Administration 

created the Clean Power Plan in 
June 2014 to increase efforts to 
combat climate change. By 2030, 
the EPA hopes the plan will have 

cut emissions from electricity-
generating facilities by 30 per-
cent below the 2005 output 
levels.

Additionally, 
the 
survey 

showed 73 percent of Americans 
support proposed requirements 
that would require new power 
plants to significantly reduce 
their greenhouse gas emissions.

HOCKEY

‘M’ freshman spent 

his childhood in 

East Lansing

By JEREMY SUMMITT

Daily Sports Editor

It’s rivalry week for the Michi-

gan hockey team, and that means 
this week cuts a little deeper for 
freshman 
defenseman 
Cutler 

Martin.

He spent his entire childhood 

in East Lansing and admits to 
rooting for the Spartans, though 
his parents were never adamant 
about supporting any particular 
school.

Michigan State has been a 

part of Martin’s life in one way or 
another for 20 years. He grew up a 
short drive from Spartan Stadium 
and attended East Lansing High 
School, a building that essentially 
rests on Michigan State’s cam-
pus, directly next to one of its 
sorority houses. Martin attended 
games at Munn Ice Arena, home 
of the Spartans’ hockey program, 
and soaked in the splendor of the 
heated Michigan-Michigan State 
matchups of the 2000s.

Martin watched Ryan Miller 

line up against Josh Blackburn 
and witnessed offensive duels 
between Justin Abdelkader and 
Kevin Porter. Now he’s on the 
other side of the glass, immersed 
inside all he knew as a young 
hockey fan.

For nearly a year now, Martin 

has been a part of the Michigan 
family, but his first game against 
the Spartans still brought back a 
flurry of memories.

“I think it was strange the first 

time I played against them in the 
(Great Lakes Invitational),” Mar-
tin said. “But now I think I’ve 
come to grips with it a little bit, 
and I’m ready to play them hard 
and play them tough.”

The first opportunity to line 

up against his hometown team 
might turn out to be the most 
memorable, too, as the Wolver-
ines eked out a 2-1 victory to 
claim the GLI championship at 
Joe Louis Arena on Dec. 29. But 
there’s more to be desired. Mar-
tin hopes there are even better 
days ahead for one of college 
hockey’s premier rivalries, one 
he’ll never cease to treasure.

Dr. Ruth Browne 

stresses role 
of expertise in 
medical inequity

By JACKIE MILLER

For the Daily

Inside several Brooklyn bar-

bershops and salons, stylists 
are beginning to talk not only 
about hair, but also health.

Wednesday 
afternoon, 

Ruth Browne, CEO of the 
Arthur Ashe Institute of Urban 

Health, lectured on the Com-
munity Health Empowerment 
model, of which the Institute’s 
barbershop programs are just 
one example.

“I think that the process of 

community engagement with 
the academic medical center 
and with government allows us 
to really affect change at a level 
that we couldn’t each indi-
vidually, as organizations, do,” 
she said. “The power of that, I 
think, is very profound.”

Salons 
and 
barbershops, 

Browne said, are examples of 
community assets or key plac-

es to foster conversations on 
health and wellness.

Within salons, the program 

Heart of a Woman works to 
train stylists to engage their 
clientele in discussions about 
heart health for women. Bar-
bers are similarly trained to 
talk about HIV/AIDS among 
the heterosexual Black, male 
community through a program 
called Barbershop Talk With 
Brothers.

For many, this environment 

may be more favorable than

Kevlar found to 
block buildup of 

electrical currents, 
prevent short circuit 

By CARLY NOAH

Daily Staff Reporter

In 2013, the lithium-ion battery 

on a Japan Airlines Boeing 787 
Dreamliner caused a fire.

Though no one was harmed in 

the accident, the issues still need-
ed a solution.

Lithium batteries work by mov-

ing the ions in the element lithium 
from one electrode to another. The 
motion creates a charge imbal-
ance, ultimately causing electrons 
to move through a circuit and 
power systems.

To prevent future accidents 

like the Japan Airlines battery 
fire, University researchers devel-
oped an advanced type of barrier 
between the electrodes in a lithi-
um-ion battery.

University researchers used 

Kevlar, the tough material in bul-
letproof vests, to create the bar-

Lynch hearing highlights 
independent perspectives 

State seeks heavier 
regulation, increased 
study of side effects

(AP) — California health offi-

cials Wednesday declared elec-
tronic cigarettes a health threat 
that should be strictly regulated 
like tobacco products, joining 
other states and health advo-
cates across the U.S. in seek-
ing tighter controls as “vaping” 
grows in popularity.

The California Department of 

Public Health report says e-cig-
arettes 
emit 
cancer-causing 

chemicals and get users hooked 
on nicotine but acknowledges 
that more research needs to be 
done to determine the imme-
diate and long-term health 
effects.

“E-cigarettes 
are 
not 
as 

harmful as conventional ciga-
rettes, 
but 
e-cigarettes 
are 

not harmless” said California 

Health Officer Ron Chapman. 
“They are not safe.”

New generations of young 

people will become nicotine 
addicts if the products remain 
largely unregulated, Chapman 
said. Last year, 17 percent of 
high school seniors reported 
using 
e-cigarettes, 
known 

as vaping, according to the 
report.

“Without action, it is likely 

that California’s more than two 
decades of progress to prevent 
and reduce traditional tobacco 
use will erode as e-cigarettes 
re-normalize smoking behav-
ior,” the report says.

E-cigarettes heat liquid nico-

tine into inhalable vapor with-
out the tar and other chemicals 
found in traditional cigarettes. 
A cartridge of nicotine can cost 
anywhere from $5 to $20 dol-
lars and can be reused.

California banned the sale of 

e-cigarettes to minors in 2010, 
but the report raises concerns 

about the products appeal to 
children with flavors such as 
cotton candy and gummy bear. 
Reports of children under 5 
with 
e-cigarette 
poisoning 

jumped from seven in 2012 to 
154 last year.

The California report says 

e-cigarettes emit as many as 10 
toxic chemicals, but advocates 
say there is no evidence those 
substances are released at dan-
gerous levels.

“Despite the health officer’s 

false claims, there is ample evi-
dence that vaping helps smokers 
quit and is far less hazardous 
than smoking,” Gregory Con-
ley, president of the e-cigarette 
advocacy 
group 
American 

Vaping Association, said in an 
email. “Smokers deserve truth-
ful and accurate information 
about the relative risks of dif-
ferent nicotine products, not 
hype and conjecture based on 
cherry-picked reports.”

Health officials called for 

restrictions on the marketing 
and sale of e-cigarettes, protec-
tions against accidental inges-
tion of liquid nicotine and an 
education campaign on the dan-
gers of using e-cigarettes.

A state senator introduced 

legislation this week that would 
regulate e-cigarettes as tobacco 
products and ban their use in 
public places such as hospitals, 
bars and schools. A similar bill 
was defeated last year over 
opposition from tobacco com-
panies.

Chapman, the health official, 

would not take a position on leg-
islation, but said his department 
would be rolling out an e-ciga-
rette awareness campaign with 
possible television and radio 
advertisements.

E-cigarettes have become more 

visible as they grow in popularity 
and commercials for the products 
air in places where traditional 
cigarette ads have been banned. 
Businesses related to e-ciga-
rettes, including vaping loung-
es, are rapidly popping up in 
cities across California.

Attorney general 
nominee seperates 
herself from Pres. 
Obama in testimony

(AP) — Confronting skeptical 

Republicans, attorney general 
nominee Loretta Lynch pledged 
a new start with Congress and 
independence from President 
Barack Obama Wednesday, even 
as she defended the president’s 
unilateral protections for mil-
lions of immigrants in the coun-
try illegally.

“If confirmed as attorney 

general, I would be myself. I 
would be Loretta Lynch,” the 
nominee told her Senate confir-
mation hearing as Republicans 
showered criticism on the cur-
rent occupant of the job, Eric 
Holder. They said Holder was 
contemptuous of Congress and 
too politically close to Obama, 
and 
repeatedly 
demanded 

assurances that Lynch would do 
things differently.

“You’re not Eric Holder, are 

you?” Texas Republican John 
Cornyn, one of the current 
attorney general’s most persis-

tent critics, asked at one point.

“No, I’m not, sir,” Lynch 

responded with a smile.

It was a moment that summed 

up a Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee hearing that was often more 
about Obama and Holder than 
about Lynch, who is now the top 
federal prosecutor for parts of 
New York City and Long Island. 
If confirmed, she would become 
the nation’s first black female 
attorney general.

Holder, Cornyn contended, 

“operated as a politician using the 
awesome power conferred by our 
laws on the attorney general.”

Lynch asked the senator to 

take note of “the independence 
that I’ve always brought to 
every particular matter,” and 
she said that when merited she 
would say no to Obama.

On 
immigration, 
Lynch 

faced 
numerous 
questions 

from Republicans critical of 
the administration’s new poli-
cy granting work permits and 
temporary deportation relief 
to some 4 million people who 
are in the country illegally. The 
committee chairman, Repub-
lican Chuck Grassley of Iowa, 
called the effort “a dangerous 
abuse of executive authority.”

Lynch 
said 
she 
had 
no 

involvement in drafting the 
measures but called them “a 
reasonable way to marshal lim-
ited resources to deal with the 
problem” of illegal immigration. 
She said the Homeland Security 
Department was focusing on 
removals of “the most danger-
ous of the undocumented immi-
grants among us.”

Pressed by Sen. Jeff Sessions 

of Alabama, a leading immigra-
tion hard-liner, she said citizen-
ship was not a right for people 
in the country illewgally but 
rather a privilege that must be 
earned. However, when Ses-
sions asked whether individu-
als in the country legally or 
those who are here unlawfully 
have more of a right to a job, 
Lynch replied, “The right and 
the obligation to work is one 
that’s shared by everyone in this 
country regardless of how they 
came here.”

Sessions quickly issued a 

news release to highlight that 
response. Under later question-
ing by Democratic Sen. Chuck 
Schumer of New York, Lynch 
clarified it, stating there is no 
right to work for an immigrant 
who has no lawful status.

weekend.

A moment of silence was held 

Tuesday before a game against 
Ohio University to mourn the 
loss of women’s basketball player 
Shannise Heady and Eastern 
Michigan senior Jordan Hopkins. 
The two students died Sunday 
morning after Heady lost control 
of her vehicle in Ypsilanti Town-

Fans in the student section 

wore T-shirts and players wore

Bottled water given

Flint residents have been quick 

to take advantage of a bottled

a new municipal water system.

Michigan Radio says it took 

about half an hour Wednesday 
morning for volunteers to give out 
about 200 cases of bottled water. 

Mike Sargent of the group Flint 

Strong says it’s a Band Aid but 
better than nothing.

Flint switched off its pipeline 

from the Detroit Water and Sew-

and has been getting its tap water 
from the Flint River.

Earlier this month, a car hit

Bart’s owner was so distraught, 
he couldn’t stand the thought of

Five days later, on Jan. 21, a

cal health insurance, and as a 
result, opportunities to engage 
in conversation with experts 
about their health.

As the CEO of the Arthur 

Ashe Institute, Browne works 
to promote health equity, 
particularly 
for 
minority 

communities. Browne began 
her lecture Wednesday recit-
ing a quote from Arthur Ashe 
himself, which provided a 
central theme for the rest of 
the talk.

“Start where you are, use 

what you have, do what you 
can,” she said.

Browne said that mantra 

guides the Institute’s strategy. 
The Institute works to pro-
vide community members in 
Brooklyn with tools, informa-
tion and resources necessary 
to encourage residents to gain 
knowledge and empowerment 
to manage their health.

Rachael Podesfinski, a Pub-

lic Policy graduate student, 
said she believes in what the 
Institute stands for.

“It’s so great that the Arthur 

Ashe Institute actually lives 
their creed by community 
empowerment and by work-
ing with the community mem-
bers,” she said.

Browne 
also 
discussed 

efforts through the Institute’s 
ACCESS program, which tar-
gets previously, incarcerated 
individuals returning to their 
community. The program is 
designed to narrow gaps in 
access to health care.

Browne said the opportu-

nities now available to people 
under the Affordable Care 
Act’s Medicaid expansion will 
work to cover people who are 
up to 138 percent of the pov-
erty level, while the new insur-
ance marketplace will provide 
subsidies to those up to those 
who are up to 400 percent of 
the poverty level.

However, Browne empha-

sized in order for these new 
changes in policy to make a 

difference, they must include 
treatment options for mental 
health and substance abuse.

Still, the Institute faces 

other challenges including the 
time it takes to train commu-
nity members to serve as advo-
cates.

Podesfinski also noted the 

unique 
qualities 
associated 

with working with minority 
communities.

“It’s important that we have 

that holistic lens as we move 
forward in our work,” she said. 
“It’s not just about the quan-
titative work that we keep 
touting. It’s also about human 
compassion and looking at his-
torical racism in underrepre-
sented communities.”

LSA senior Joel Adu-Brim-

pong said Browne’s speech 
had the power to expand the 
ways in which communities 
approach health challenges.

“It can broaden people’s 

horizons about what some peo-
ple are doing and what people 
can do,” he said.

loid formation,” she said.

Though it is possible that the 

research could lead to treatment 
for Parkinson’s, Chapman noted 
that this notion is “within the 

realm of optimistic thinking,” 
but added that there is much 
more research to be done.

“Understanding 
what 
the 

potential therapeutics for a par-
ticular disease are just the first 
step,” he said. “We still have 
lots of work to do to provide a 
cure.”

To accomplish that goal, the 

EPA is working with states to 
create 
individually 
targeted 

emission reduction goals. The 
poll also addressed policies and 
restrictions states could employ 
to comply with the Clean Power 
Plan.

Eighty-four percent of the 

942 survey participants sup-
ported 
the 
requirement 
of 

energy efficiency standards for 
new homes and appliances. Sev-
enty-nine percent approved of 
renewable portfolio standards 
— policies that would increase 
the generation of electricity 
from renewable resources.

Nic Clark, the state director 

for Clean Water Action, said he 
was not surprised by the high 
support for environmental ini-
tiatives.

“Resoundingly, when we go 

out and talk about issues of our 
changing climate, such as emis-
sions from coal-fired power 
plants,” Clark said, “people 
really see it as a no-brainer and 
are very supportive of measures 
to reduce our impact on our 
changing climate.”

In his State of the State 

address, Republican Gov. Rick 
Snyder announced the creation 
of a new state energy agency. 
He will give a speech in March 
focused on energy and his plans 
for the new agency.

“It needs to be an adapt-

able policy because of the lack 
of federal policy and the chal-
lenges of a global market place,” 
he said in his address. “We need 
to focus in on important things, 
such as, eliminating energy 
waste and the conversion from 
coal to natural gas assets of the 
state of Michigan and renew-
ables.”

Currently, Michigan is work-

ing under the Clean, Renewable 
and Efficient Energy Act, signed 

into law in October 2008, which 
mandates that Michigan elec-
tricity suppliers include at least 
10-percent renewable energy 
sources by 2015.

Though the survey showed 

most 
Americans 
support 

actions for energy efficiency, 
people had differing opinions 
about what their individual 
states should do. Forty-three 
percent of Americans want 
their state to wait to implement 
new policies until there was 
more knowledge on the Clean 
Power Plan, and to see how 
other states pass legislation to 
handle the standards. Another 
41 percent feel adopting new 
standards should not be up to 
the states, and instead they 
should all cooperate with the 
federal government on a Clean 
Power Plan program.

Conversely, 
a 
9-percent 

minority feels their state should 
refuse to cooperate with the 
new standards and instead 
band with other individual 
states to jointly sue the federal 
government over the ordeal.

According to the survey data, 

both Republicans and Demo-
crats see value in the plan to 
reduce emissions, but differ in 
their view on how to address 
the issue at the state level. Fif-
ty-two percent of Republicans 
support waiting until other 
states pass legislation, and then 
modeling their state plans off 
of those piloted by other states, 
while 52 percent of Democrats 
support making the initiative a 
more federally guided project.

In Michigan, both legislators 

and special interest groups see 
Snyder’s state energy agency as 
a start, but are unsure of what 
the proposal will bring.

State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D–Ann 

Arbor) said Snyder has made 
some strong statements on 
conservation and energy, but it 
remains to be seen what, exact-
ly, he will do with his opportu-
nity to lead on the issue.

“I think there really is an 

opportunity for a bipartisan 
compromise and a real coming 
together of the parties on con-
servation, which is not the most 
sexy element of energy policy, 
but is probably actually the 
most important,” Irwin said.

Irwin said energy policies 

not only help the environment, 
but by creating initiatives that 
put people back to work and 
help save citizens money, help 
the economy as well.

Clark, of Clean Water Action, 

also noted the ways in which 
combatting 
climate 
change 

could be beneficial for eco-
nomic reasons, pointing to the 
large sums of money Michigan 
spends annually to repair dam-
age caused by extreme weather.

While they were happy to 

hear Snyder was showing posi-
tive support to the cause, Clark 
and Irwin both questioned how 
much change he would actually 
bring.

“The 
governor 
announc-

ing his plan to address this is 
great,” Clark said, “but we need 
real-world action now.”

Irwin added that this issue 

could be an opportunity for 
bipartisanship.

“I think there may be some 

real, bipartisan, coming togeth-
er on efficiency and conserva-
tion, which certainly can lead 
to a reduction of emissions,” 
Irwin said. “But when it comes 
to focusing on a purely envi-
ronmental goal, like reducing 
emissions, I think it’s going to 
be very, very difficult to get the 
attention of the Republicans.”

He also pointed to the influ-

ence fossil fuel companies have 
over the Michigan legislature.

“When you get over to the 

other issues, such as trying to 
wean ourselves off of dirty fuel, 
that is going to be harder,” he 
said.

The survey results reflected 

Irwin’s viewpoint: 59 percent 
of Americans opposed increas-
ing taxes on fossil fuels used to 
produce electricity.

rier. It stops the growth of metal 
appendages that can create 
unwanted pathways for electri-
cal currents to travel through, 
ultimately disrupting electron 
flow to the battery’s circuit. The 
disruption can cause potentially 
dangerous accidents.

Kevlar’s heat resistance can 

also help make batteries safer 
because the membrane material 
is more likely to survive a fire 
than types of materials.

Chemical Engineering Prof. 

Nicholas Kotov wrote in a 
release that unlike previously 
used materials, Kevlar is an 
insulator.

“This property is perfect for 

separators that need to prevent 
shorting between two elec-
trodes,” Kotov said.

To market their product, the 

researchers 
founded 
Elegus 

Technologies in Ann Arbor.

University alum John Hen-

nessy, Elegus CEO and co-
founder, 
said 
the 
project 

emerged from the University’s 
Masters in Entrepreneurship 
program.

“A lot of people want to make 

thinner and thinner batteries, 
but the components to do that 

are very hard to make,” Hen-
nessy said. “If you can safely 
make a battery thinner and put 
more energy in it, that’s very 
desirable.”

The battery fires on the Boe-

ing 787 were thought to have 
started by lithium atoms trans-
forming into “dendrites” — fern-
like structures that can poke 
through the battery membrane. 
If these dendrites reach the 
electrode, the electrons have 
a path into the battery and can 
short out the circuit.

The Kevlar membranes devel-

oped at the University are large 
enough to let individual lithium 
ions pass, but small enough to 
block the tips of the fern struc-
tures.

Dan VanderLey, who helped 

found Elegus through the Uni-
versity’s of Entrepreneurship 
program, wrote in a release that 
the material is special because it 
can be made very thin.

“We can get more energy into 

the same battery cell size, or we 
can shrink the cell size,” Vander-
Ley said. “We’ve seen a lot of 
interest from people looking to 
make thinner products.”

Mass production for the bat-

tery is expected to begin at the 
end of 2016. So far, 30 companies 
have requested samples of the 
material.

take place when Michigan and 
Michigan State meet at Joe 
Louis Arena for the second 
time this season in the “Duel 
in the D”. With both teams rid-
ing waves of momentum — the 
Spartans have won six of eight, 
while the Wolverines have won 
seven straight — Friday’s show-
down should allow hockey fans 
to reminisce about the early 
2000s.

Martin has little time to pon-

der his childhood, though, as he 
has been thrust into consistent 
action for much of his rookie 
campaign. In impressive fash-
ion, he has responded by post-
ing nine points in 17 games.

With 
Martin’s 
allegiance 

already pledged to Michigan, 
senior forward Zach Hyman 
said Martin rarely receives 
heat for hailing from East Lan-
sing. Nevertheless, it’s a place 
that the freshman defenseman 
keeps in the back of his mind.

“It is exciting that it is my 

hometown,” Martin said, “and I 
have a little bit of extra excite-
ment to beat them.”

There was never a lot of 

thought about attending Michi-
gan State and lacing his skates 
each weekend in the bowels of 
Munn Ice Arena. Instead, Mar-
tin felt the need to branch out 
and explore.

“My parents really encour-

aged me at a young age, even 
when I wasn’t sure if I was 
going to play hockey or not, to 
travel out, go down south, go 
do a different state, get out of 
East Lansing,” Martin said. 
“They were never against it, but 
they definitely wanted me to 
explore, see new cultures, meet 
new people elsewhere, because 
East Lansing is a small town 
and everyone seems to know 
everybody.”

In the midst of what has been 

a memorable freshman season, 
Martin seems to have found a 
second home. He cited Michi-

gan’s prominence paired with 
Michigan State’s demise in the 
late 2000s as a secondary rea-
son he ultimately chose Ann 
Arbor over his hometown.

“Ann Arbor — it’s East Lan-

sing on steroids,” Martin said.

The transition from East 

Lansing to Ann Arbor isn’t as 
far-fetched as one might think, 
either. Martin’s great grandfa-
ther was once the president of 
the M Club, and Martin’s aunt, 
who currently resides in Ann 
Arbor, made a persistent push 
for her nephew to check out the 
campus and eventually enroll at 
Michigan.

“She definitely had an influ-

ence on me at an early age,” 
Martin said.

A culmination of familial 

influences and a craving for a 
fresh scene gradually built the 
foundation for Martin’s deci-
sion. On Nov. 20, 2013, the 
Michigan hockey program offi-
cially announced that his let-
ter of intent had been signed, 
and the memory of rooting for 
Michigan State as an elemen-
tary-school kid was reduced to 
just another childhood memo-
ry.

His small white-and-green 

shirts from those hockey nights 
in East Lansing with his family 
are tucked away somewhere. 
Martin dons distinctive maize 
attire these days, and he rare-
ly misses an opportunity to 
remark on how honored he feels 
to play at Michigan.

Rivalries pull at the heart, 

for better and for worse, within 
every sports fan. This one has 
been pulling at Martin since he 
was growing up, walking the 
streets of Michigan State’s cam-
pus and roaming the halls of the 
local high school.

Now, as he walks around 

Yost Ice Arena just days before 
the Spartans and Wolverines 
are set to meet for the 301st 
time, he smiles and remembers, 
because this rivalry won’t be 
fading anytime soon.

INDIANAPOLIS 
(AP) 
— 

Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said 
Wednesday he regrets the “con-
fusion” caused by a memo about 
his 
administration’s 
planned 

state-run news website and will 
kill the project if it doesn’t respect 
the role of an independent press.

Pence’s comments followed 

criticism from around the coun-
try about the proposed “Just 
IN” site and came as the Repub-
lican governor’s staff worked 
to portray it as a project aimed 
at bettering organizing and 
presenting news releases from 
state agencies.

Pence told WIBC-FM that 

a memo describing the site as 
a news outlet with a managing 
editor and editorial board was 
“poorly crafted” and did not 
meet his expectations.

“It is not appropriate to 

describe the objectives of a 
clearinghouse website of press 
releases 
with 
news-related 

terms,” he said. “I regret the 
confusion here.”

The Indianapolis Star first 

reported Monday that inter-
nal documents about the site’s 
launch detailed a plan to have 
state communications officials 
write news stories and distrib-
ute them through “Just IN.” That 
plan said the site would include 
stories and news releases writ-
ten by state press secretaries for 
the public and the media and at 
times would break news.

The site isn’t expected to be 

in operation until mid-February 
and terminology such as “man-
aging editor” and “stories” will 
be replaced with “content man-
ager” and “news releases” to 
clarify the source of material, 
said Christy Denault, Pence’s 
communications director.

The site would replace the 

state’s current online listing of 
agency news releases, she said.

The notion of stories prewrit-

ten for the media set off a wave of 
criticism from journalists around 
the country, who used headlines 
such as “Pravda on the Plains” 

to liken the Indiana endeavor to 
state-run media in Russia and 
China. A Twitter account paro-
dying the site had more than 
1,700 followers by Wednesday.

Though Pence has fueled talk 

of a possible 2016 White House 
run, such parodies likely aren’t 
reaching much beyond news 
media watchers and political 
junkies, said Kelly McBride, a 
vice president of the Poynter 
Institute, a Florida-based jour-
nalism think tank.

But she said the site could 

be used to promote a political 
agenda if it has certain features.

“They’ll build audience by 

having some sort of personality 
on the site — and that’s how it 
could easily become an arm of 
politics,” McBride said.

Denault said the website plan 

was still being finalized and 
that organizers hope to discuss 
it with the Hoosier State Press 
Association and Society of Pro-
fessional Journalists before the 
site launches.

Being white, we do not have to care about 

race. Some of us make the choice to do so, 
but it’s not necessary. Our lives, the lives of 
our friends and families and the livelihood of 
our communities, are not negatively affected 
by race. Thus, we have no obligation to care 
about it.

Being white, we are also afforded the lux-

ury of believing race doesn’t exist. I’m very 
thankful to say I went to one of the top public 
school systems in the nation, but we learned 
almost nothing about race. We learned that 
first there was slavery, then Abraham Lin-
coln (a white man) came along and freed the 
slaves. After that, there was widespread rac-
ism until Martin Luther King Jr. swooped 
down with his dream and made racism go 
away forever.

When we’re told that race doesn’t exist 

anymore, and when we don’t experience it, 
it’s very easy to believe that racism is over. 
This is where the problems really begin.

In light of the incidents of Ferguson, Mis-

souri, and Eric Garner, race has been thrown 
back into the national spotlight. It has been a 
hot topic on campus, as well, with many stu-
dents of color speaking out against injustice, 
and many white students denying the exis-
tence of these injustices. I’ve been involved 
in many of these conversations, and it’s 
 

particularly infuriating.

I only know what it’s like to be a white 

man, I do not know what it’s like to be a per-
son of color, and so I won’t speak on their 
behalf. This is written by a white person as 
a way to provide people of all colors insight 
into why it’s so difficult for white people to 
talk about race.

There was a time in which I truly believed 

racism didn’t exist, and was fairly racist 
myself. Thankfully, that time has passed. 
Here, I’m trying to outline the mental road-
blocks that prevent white people from rec-
ognizing race. In truth, it all comes from our 
egos.

It’s much easier for the human ego to argue 

that a problem doesn’t exist than to admit that 
a problem does exist and that we are a part of 
it. When we deny the experiences of people of 
color, we are putting our ego before our integ-
rity, our sense of self-accomplishment before 
our sense of justice.

This is because when we’re told that rac-

ism still exists; this implies that we have 
been benefitting from racism our entire lives. 
This implies that to accomplish what we have 
accomplished as individuals, a person of color 

would have to conquer many more obstacles 
than we have faced. This is basically saying 
that we didn’t really earn everything the way 
we thought we did, and people hate to hear 
that harsh truth. That truth damages our 
precious egos, which we will do anything 
 

to protect.

So instead of admitting that racism is still 

a huge problem in this country, we argue 
with the people of color who are speaking the 
truth to us. By denying their lifelong experi-
ences of racism, we are being racist. We are 
saying that we know racism better than the 
people experiencing it. We are saying that 
our concept of racism is more important and 
more accurate than the concepts of racism 
expressed by people of color. We are proving 
our racism by denying our racism.

But wait, there’s more! This denial of rac-

ism is often rationalized by believing that 
people of color today aren’t experiencing “real 
racism.” This is basically saying that because 
racism isn’t as out in the open and obvious as 
it was before the Civil Rights Movement, that 
racism is over. By saying this, we are also say-
ing that we can’t possibly be racist, because 
“real racists” constantly enact violence upon 
people of color and use racial slurs comfort-
ably and regularly. The only “real racism” 
is the racism that people of color speak out 
against, which now includes the comments 
we make when we deny the reality of racism 
in this country.

So how do we begin to understand racism 

in our country? As crazy as it sounds, let’s try 
listening to people of color. Let’s try to edu-
cate ourselves on what racism is today. Let’s 
try to put our integrity before our ego. Let’s 
try to admit that we’re wrong.

Once we admit to the reality of racism, we 

will feel guilty. This is a normal reaction, but 
we need to move on from guilt. Turn that 
guilt into anger! Be angry that we’ve been lied 
to our whole lives, be angry that we’ve been 
racist without realizing it and be angry that 
so many people are terrified of the truth!

So make the choice. We can decide to care 

about race and choose to fight it wherever 
we see it. Or we can choose to not care about 
race, and stand up proudly to exclaim, “I’m 
white, I don’t care about people of color and I 
am racist!” Make a choice of where you stand 
in this fight. If you don’t choose, you have 
no right to complain when you get caught in 
 

the crossfire.

I live in fear.
I fear that I will be denied a job because 

I may be living with someone of the 
 

same gender.

I fear that I will have to choose a job based 

on its equal-opportunity policies, rather than 
it being my dream job.

I fear that my immediate family and friends 

hide their true thoughts about my identity and 
life choices.

I fear that my extended family will cut me 

out and keep me out of their lives.

I fear that my pansexuality is not seen as a 

Queer identity in the eyes of “the community.”

I fear that I am expressing a façade to 
 

the public.

I live in uncertainty.
I live uncertain about whether I will be able 

to marry.

I live uncertain about whether I will 

marry a woman, a man or someone of 
 

another gender.

I live uncertain about whether I will be cre-

ating my own children or whether I will be fil-
ing for adoption.

I live uncertain about whether my family 

will accept my children if they are adopted.

I live uncertain about whether my connec-

tion with God truly is in its best relationship 
at this moment.

I live uncertain where I will be able to live 

and where I will be accepted once I leave this 
bubble we call “hoMe.”

But if I live each day in fear and in uncer-

tainty, how will I see what is ahead of me? 
How will I understand that my daily choices 
will affect my future? How will I accept the 
fact that everyone in my life is impacted by 
my love, laughter and compassion? How will 
I succeed in life if I identify with the Queer 
community? I will not know the answers to 

these questions if I continue to live in fear 
 

and uncertainty.

I live as Ryan Freeland. I live as a lover, a 

giver and a fighter. I live as a college student, a 
friend, a son and a brother. I live as a Christian 
and a white male. I have many identities and I 
am honored to call them my identities because 
they make me visible to the public.

But I am not hesitant or in denial of my sex-

uality. I am proud of my pansexual identity. 
I am proud of myself. I love myself. To truly 
accept your inner self and expose it to the pub-
lic takes a lot of courage, and I send my grati-
tude to every Queer individual because YOU 
conquered the most difficult task of all: loving 
yourself and accepting yourself.

It has only been six months since I have 

openly identified as pansexual. It has been 
difficult. It has been heartbreaking. It has 
been ugly. But I know that this is my life and I 
truly love every daily experience. Yes, I do live 
in fear. Yes, I do live in uncertainty. But also, I 
live with love. I love my identity because it is 
the one identity that makes me feel real juxta-
posed to my other identities.

I live with pride.
I am proud to be pansexual.
I am proud of my immediate family and 

friends for acknowledging and listening to 
my words.

I am proud of my achievements.
I am proud to continue living with 
 

my identity.

I am proud to commit to pursuing whatever 

I want in life without my one identity being a 
drawback.

Fear and uncertainty

SANDER BREGMAN | VIEWPOINT

Why it’s hard for white people 

to talk about race

DAVID MOOSMAN| VIEWPOINT

We have a Muckraker in our 

midst. With a capital M.

Muckraker is a term considered 

to be popularized by Theodore 
Roosevelt in reference to journal-
ists or reporters just looking to stir 
up controversy.

Now we have one embedded 

in the fabled hall of Bo Schem-
bechler himself. This Muckraker 
denounced the Michigan Athletic 
Department for its “ways to get bor-
derline guys in and, when they’re 
in, they steer them to courses in 
sports communications.”

In 
2007, 
Michigan 
football 

coach Jim Harbaugh talked about 
the standards that other esteemed 
institutions such as Stanford hold, 
standards that should be the model 
for the entire National Collegiate 
Athletic Association. These are the 
same standards that our beloved 
Michigan has let slip.

In retort, former football player 

Michael Hart, our fearless and 
never-outspoken leader, said of 
Harbaugh that, “He’s not a Michi-
gan man. I wish he’d never played 
here.”

Well, Harbaugh did play here, 

and now he’s coaching here. Not 
coaching here – he’s the coach.

Harbaugh is said muckraker, and 

we shunned him for what he said. 
How could he dream of talking 
about his alma mater like this?

His only feeble counter was, “I 

learned from a great man named 
Bo Schembechler that you speak 
the truth as you know it. It may not 
be the popular thing, but you speak 
your mind.”

Well, Bo was right. They were 

both right.

No matter what has been shown 

to the contrary, it seems other peo-
ple have noticed this same problem 
persisting. Newly appointed Uni-
versity President Mark Schlissel 
admitted, “We admit students who 
aren’t as qualified, and it’s probably 
the kids that we admit that can’t 
honestly, even with lots of help, do 
the amount of work and the quality 
of work it takes to make progres-
sion from year to year.”

Maybe we let two dissidents into 

our ranks: the wrong coach and the 
wrong president.

Or maybe we finally have the 

right two — Michigan Men — in 
the two of the highest positions of 
power.

Neither wants to relax his stan-

dards as to what this great Univer-
sity should and will hold. And on 

both campuses, they are high for 
sure, but our standards for Michi-
gan aren’t high, they’re the highest. 
We’re not the leaders and the aver-
age. We’re not even the leaders and 
the pretty good. We are the leaders 
and the best. The best.

We shouldn’t be condemning 

Harbaugh and Schlissel, question-
ing their loyalty when they’re only 
questioning our mediocrity.

Michigan is a tough place to 

make a living. Things are never 
good enough. Ask Devin Gardner 
or Brady Hoke. Both great, unques-
tionably classy guys. Gardner gave a 
helping hand to the Buckeyes’ quar-
terback, J.T. Barrett, on national 
television, but he wasn’t the most 
successful 
quarterback 
we’ve 

ever had. He’ll be remembered as 
 

a failure.

In 2006, the Michigan football 

team went 11-2. They were basically 
three touchdowns away from dou-
bling points scored versus points 
against. But we lost the two most 
important games, the last two. 
Another failure.

At Michigan, all we want is more. 

All we want is the best. As fans, we 
want more wins, more success and 
more victories over Ohio State. We 
ostracize the critics who are only 
asking for the better Michigan they 
know it can be. Then, they come 
home to fix those problems, and we 
applaud them as Michigan Men.

This idea of the Michigan Man, 

a tough one to narrow down, has 
come to seem like just being here 
would give you this distinguished 
title. Just like the idea that those 
who stay will be champions. Some, 
possibly, took that as a promise. As 
in, “Don’t worry, your champion-
ship will come in time.”

Like someone else was going to 

win that title for you. That’s not a 
Michigan Man.

This ideal, this vision of a Michi-

gan Man, has caused our recent 
stumble. It was because this school 
needed a “Michigan Man” that we 
got rid of Rich Rodriguez for Hoke. 
That lineage was more important 
than skill. This idea that if we slap 
a moniker on someone, they have it 
for life, and are better suited for the 
job than someone without it.

Behind the idea of the Michigan 

Man is that this selfless person is 
striving for the greater good. Some-
thing beyond himself. Something 
more important than his own well-
being. What we need is every per-
son working and competing for the 

University of Michigan.

This is the aspect that we need to 

keep and pass on about the Michi-
gan Man. But unfortunately, there’s 
more to it. There’s a stigma that 
all one needs is the block ‘M.’ That 
everything will be fine as long as 
you’re Michigan. Michigan expects 
to win. Michigan Men have a tradi-
tion of winning – the winningest 
program in college football.

But it was never the name that 

won all those games. It was never 
the Big House that scared the oppo-
nents. It was never the winged hel-
met that sent them cowering. And 
now it isn’t our shiny new coach-
ing staff. What won those games 
and what will win them again 
in the future is the binder for all 
 

these facets.

Toughness. Toughness was what 

Bo Schembechler built his program 
on. It’s why Harbaugh spoke out 
about what he believed even against 
all the backlash of his alma mater. 
Apparently it meant something to 
shake hands with Frank Sinatra; 
who knows? Around here, shaking 
hands with Bo meant something, 
but not as much as taking a jab from 
him, right to the sternum.

Those who stay will be champi-

ons. Back then it was hard to stay 
and even harder to do. Staying 
meant that there would be more 
pain to endure. Staying meant that 
there would be less sleep, more 
work, more practices and tougher 
practices. Quit, go ahead, we wish 
not one man more with which to 
share the glory.

It has always been the people 

that bring glory to the ‘M,’ never 
the other way around. Those who 
stay will be champions, but only at 
a place where the only options are 
becoming a champion or quitting. 
We have an opportunity to right this 
ship with an old heretic at its helm.

The cynicism of a once-ostra-

cized muckraker is now the res-
urrection of Schembechler’s long 
standards. The ideals of Bo are 
back. The ideals of toughness over 
selfishness and intelligence aiding 
toughness and Michigan woven 
throughout. It’s hard to tell if we’ll 
have a winning team next year, but 
you can be sure it’ll be brimming 
with tough men, intelligent men, 
Michigan Men.

David Moosman is a 2009 LSA 

graduate. He played offensive line for 

Michigan from 2005 to 2009 under 

Lloyd Carr and Rich Rodriguez.

Super Bowl Sunday 

has arrived! Here are four 
things to do to prepare 
yourselves for the show-
down between the New 
England Patriots and Se-
attle Seahawks in the Uni-
versity of Phoenix Stadium.

EAT LOTS OF FOOD. 

LOTS OF IT

 
Everybody 
looks 
for 

an excuse to splurge and 
nix that restricting diet 
for a day, so why not do it 
for the Super Bowl? Res-
taurants and food joints 
always have great deals 
for Super Bowl Sunday, 
especially in Ann Arbor. 

Take advantage of those 

great deals and eat to your 
heart’s content. Whether 
it’s takeout from your favor-
ite barbecue joint or a sim-
ple box of pizza, grab some-
thing you like and munch 
on it during the game! 

After 
all, 
the 
only 

thing better than watch-
ing a football game is eat-

ing while you’re doing it.

DON’T WATCH THE 

SUPERBOWL, WATCH 

THE PUPPY BOWL
 
Let’s 
be 
honest: 
for 

some, 
watching 
large 

men 
tackle 
each 
oth-

er for fun isn’t always 
the most pleasant sight. 

If you’re a little fainter at 

heart, skip the Super Bowl 
and watch the Puppy Bowl! 

Let 
the 
spectacle 

of puppies of all kinds 
nonsensically 
running 

around warm your heart.

THROW A WATCH 

PARTY

What 
better 
way 
to 

spend the Super Bowl than 
to spend it with friends? 
Throw a little soirée and 
invite some good friends 
to enjoy those funny Super 
Bowl 
commercials 
with. 

Not the party type? No 

problem, there are a lot 
of places where you can 
enjoy the football game 
in a more lively setting. 

PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY PAUL SHERMAN/Daily

The New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will faceoff this Sunday in the NFL Super Bowl XLIX.

Going to a restaurant 

like Buffalo Wild Wings 
is a great way to enjoy 
the 
game 
with 
friends 

and eat good food, too.

PREPARE FOR KATY 

PERRY

Katy Perry is scheduled 

to perform at this year’s 
 

halftime show Sunday and 
fireworks are surely go-
ing to go off. I suggest a 
48-hour 
binge 
session 

on all of her classics from 
“One of the Boys,” “Teen-
age Dream” and “Prism” 

to make sure you get the 
full halftime experience. 

Bonus points for prep-

ping yourselves for Idina 
Menzel’s performance of 
the national anthem and 
John Legend’s predictably 
heart-stopping 
rendition 

of “America the Beautiful.”

Ahead of the game: 
winter study tips

By TANAZ AHMED

Weekend Roundup Contributor

It may not feel like it, 

but we’re already a month 
into the new semester, and 
there’s an avalanche of pa-
pers and exams waiting 
for you. There’s no need 
to worry, though. We’ve 
got a few study tips to 
help you beat the storm.

Get rid of distractions

This one’s a no-brainer, 

yet also the hardest to do. 
The Internet is full of dis-
tractions 
like 
Facebook, 

Twitter, 
Instagram 
and 

Buzzfeed. You may think 
you’re only taking a quick 
five-minute 
study 
break 

when you go on Buzzfeed, 
but let’s be honest, you’ll be 
on the site for much longer 
than that! Try programs like 
Cold Turkey or Self Con-
trol to temporarily block 
sites on your computer.

Make a practice test

If your professor doesn’t 

provide you with practice 
tests, make your own. In-
stead of just looking up the 
answers, turn your study 

guide into a mock exam and 
quiz yourself. Give yourself 
the same amount of time as 
your actual exam, and take 
it in a quiet place, model-
ing the test environment. 
This will help you quickly 
identify areas you need to 
study more carefully or in 
which you may need help.

Chew gum

Pop in some Double-

mint 
or 
Trident 
while 

you’re studying or writ-
ing a paper. According to 
Scientific American study, 
chewing gum may increase 
students’ 
concentration 

and improve their reflexes, 
due to the increased flow 
of oxygen to areas of the 
brain that control attention.

Sit in the same place

If your test is being ad-

ministered in your usual 
classroom, sit in the same 
place you usually sit dur-
ing lecture. A Montana 
State 
University 
study 

found when students are 
tested in the same environ-
ment where they learned 
the information, they are 
more likely to remember 
what they were taught.

Harbaugh secures staff

Five assistants come 

from NFL jobs

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

One month has passed since 

Jim Harbaugh was introduced as 
Michigan’s head football coach. 
In that time, he has been tasked 
with hiring a coaching staff 
and filling out a recruiting class 
that was decimated because of 
questions 
surrounding 
Brady 

Hoke’s job status.

Now, the first of those tasks 

is complete. You already know 
offensive 
coordinator 
and 

offensive line coach Tim Drevno 
as well as defensive coordinator 
and 
linebackers 
coach 
D.J. 

Durkin, but here’s a rundown of 
the rest of Harbaugh’s staff.

Jedd Fisch, passing game 

coordinator, 
quarterbacks 

coach, wide receivers coach

Like Harbaugh, Fisch’s most 

recent job was in the NFL. He 
spent the past two seasons as 
the offensive coordinator for the 
Jacksonville Jaguars, where he 
was charged with developing 
an offense stacked with young 
players. Throughout his coaching 
career, 
Fisch 
has 
bounced 

between the college ranks and 
the NFL. Before his job with the 
Jaguars, Fisch was the offensive 
coordinator at the University of 
Miami for two seasons, following a 
one-year stint as the quarterbacks 
coach for the Seattle Seahawks. 
Fisch isn’t new to the Big Ten 
— he spent the 2009 season as 
Minnesota’s offensive coordinator 
and quarterbacks coach.

Tyrone Wheatley, running 

backs coach

Harbaugh 
isn’t 
the 
only 

member of Michigan’s coaching 
staff to return to Ann Arbor after 
starring for the Wolverines in 
college. Wheatley was a three-

time All-Big Ten selection at 
running back from 1992 to 1994 
and was also an All-American 
in track and field in 1995. 
Wheatley comes to Michigan 
after spending two years as the 
running backs coach for the 
Buffalo Bills. Wheatley’s son, 
Tyrone Wheatley Jr., is a senior 
in high school and a top Michigan 
target. He was in Ann Arbor for 
an official visit this week.

Jay Harbaugh, tight ends 

coach, assistant special teams 
coach

Yes, Jay is Jim’s son. The 

25-year-old 
is 
the 
youngest 

member of Michigan’s coaching 
staff, coming off of three seasons 
working for his uncle John as 
an 
offensive 
quality 
control 

coach for the Baltimore Ravens. 
Many expect Jay’s youth to be 
an asset on the recruiting trail, 
where relatability can be a key 
factor in a prospect’s decision. 
Harbaugh’s Twitter profile refers 
to Michigan as “The New Tight 
End U.” He has wasted little time 
setting the bar high.

Greg Mattison, defensive 

line coach

Mattison returns to Michigan 

under 
Harbaugh’s 
regime 

after spending four years as 
the 
Wolverines’ 
defensive 

coordinator 
under 
Hoke. 

Though 
Mattison 
regularly 

cited his close friendship with 
Hoke as the primary reason 
he was at Michigan, Mattison 
also has ties to the Harbaugh 
family. Under John Harbaugh 
in 
Baltimore, 
Mattison 
first 

served as the defensive line coach 
before moving up to defensive 
coordinator. 
Mattison 
also 

worked under Jim and John’s 
father, Jack, at Western Michigan 
from 1982 to 1986.

Greg Jackson, secondary 

coach

Jackson is another member of 

Michigan’s coaching staff with 
an NFL pedigree. He spent the 
last four years as a member of 
Harbaugh’s staff with the San 
Francisco 49ers, serving as the 
team’s assistant secondary coach 
for all four of Harbaugh’s years 
there. As a player, Jackson spent 
12 years in the NFL, recording 32 
career interceptions.

Michael Zordich, secondary 

coach

The specific roles for Zordich 

and Jackson in the secondary 
have not yet been defined. 
Zordich spent the past two 
seasons as the safeties coach and 
co-special teams coordinator 
at 
Youngstown 
State. 
Prior 

to that, he spent four seasons 
on the coaching staff of the 
Philadelphia Eagles. An All-
American safety at Penn State in 
1985, Zordich played 12 seasons 
in the NFL.

John Baxter, special teams 

coordinator

Baxter comes to Michigan 

after spending four years at 
Southern California from 2010 to 
2013. He isn’t short on coaching 
experience, having taken his 
first job at Loras College in 1981. 
Baxter’s 2013 special teams unit 
at USC thrived, ranking second 
in the country with three blocked 
punts and fourth in blocked kicks 
with six.

Kevin Tolbert, director of 

strength and conditioning

Tolbert is the second member 

of Harbaugh’s staff in San 
Francisco to follow him to 
Ann 
Arbor. 
Tolbert 
worked 

with Harbaugh for all four of 
Harbaugh’s years with the 49ers 
as the team’s assistant strength 
and conditioning coach. Tolbert 
also worked with Harbaugh for 
two years at Stanford and was 
an assistant strength coach for 
Michigan from 2001 to 2007 
under Lloyd Carr.

Michigan slows down 
game to gut out win

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Last season, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team welcomed 
Nebraska to Crisler Center as a 
heavy favorite. Early in the first 
half, the Wolverines took a lead 
and smelled blood. Using their 
talented lineup complete with 
two future NBA draft picks, they 
stepped on the gas and ran the 
Cornhuskers out of the gym.

They ran the floor to the tune 

of 63 possessions and won, 79-50 
— and it wasn’t even that close. 
They led by as many as 41 in the 
second half.

Tuesday, Nebraska made its 

return to Ann Arbor, but this 
time, Nik Stauskas and Glenn 
Robinson III were gone, junior 
guard Caris LeVert was out with 
a foot injury and sophomore 
guard Derrick Walton Jr. tested 
his foot in warmups but sat out.

Michigan 
didn’t 
have 
the 

luxury of running up the score 
on the Cornhuskers, so it slowed 
things down and slogged out a 
57-possession, 58-44 win. It was 
just as impressive, but not as flashy 
— as Nebraska coach Tim Miles 
said, “At the end of the day, I just 
thought that they out-competed 
us, they out-executed us and we 
didn’t show much heart.”

Facing an uphill but doable 

battle to get to the NCAA 
Tournament with nine games 
left, the Wolverines may have 
to use that strategy more and 
more. With LeVert out for the 
season and Walton on the shelf 
for an undetermined length of 
time, they sent a combination of 
unheralded recruits, walk-ons 
and freshmen at the Cornhuskers.

And it worked.
“We gotta bring that effort 

every night,” said sophomore 
forward Zak Irvin, who had 
the first double-double by any 
Michigan player this season 
with 11 points and 12 rebounds. 

“I think we had a big chip on 
our shoulder after that tough 
loss we took to Wisconsin. We 
just brought it out on Nebraska 
tonight.”

The Wolverines clung to a five-

point lead at halftime but kept 
their lights-out defense going 
in the second half. After a quick 
13-0 run, they led by 18 and had 
the Cornhuskers on their heels 
just like last year.

This time, they slowed the 

tempo 
enough 
to 
frustrate 

Nebraska. Instead of starting the 
fast break after rebounds, they 
settled into their offense, led 
by junior guard Spike Albrecht. 
They mixed up their defense and 
held Nebraska’s Terran Petteway 
to 1-for-11 shooting.

“In the second half, we made a 

little run against their 2-3 zone,” 
Miles said, “and never saw it 
again.”

Without its two best players, 

Michigan knew it couldn’t shoot 
13-for-31 from 3-point range like 
it did last year. So the Wolverines 
took just 14 triples and connected 
on 
six, 
getting 
help 
from 

freshman guard Muhammad-
Ali 
Abdur-Rahkman’s 
strong 

dribble penetration to make up 
the difference.

“You don’t want to take too 

many 
crazy 
shots,” 
Abdur-

Rahkman said. “Sometimes it’s a 

good shot, sometimes it’s not, so 
you just want to control the game.”

Added Michigan coach John 

Beilein: “We were going to 
take what was open to us, but 
certainly when we got ahead by 
that, we weren’t going to keep 
shooting so quickly. We wanted 
to value the clock and make sure 
they had to work really hard 
against every defense we threw 
at them.”

After 
Tuesday’s 
win, 
the 

Wolverines are no healthier than 
they were before it. And a brutal 
month of February still beckons: 
Michigan will play six of its seven 
games against teams in the top 
half of the Big Ten with trips to 
Michigan State, Indiana, Illinois 
and Maryland.

Despite the depleted lineup, 

the Wolverines may just have 
found a way to steal a few wins 
without their injured players.

“These are things we can 

control right now,” Beilein said. 
“We can control the type of rest 
we’re getting in between and 
when we’re going to bed, how 
we’re eating. We can control 
our effort. We can control our 
attitude. We can control how fast 
we run. … There’s nothing more 
important than getting your guys 
to understand that concept, and 
the rest of the stuff sort of comes 
together.”

‘M’ to host No. 5 Maryland

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Writer

With 
Maryland 
coming 

to town just 72 hours later, it 
wouldn’t have been inexcusable 
for 
the 

Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
team to look 
past an Illinois 
team ranked in 
the bottom half 
of the Big Ten.

But it wasn’t 

until 
after 

40 
minutes 

against 
the 

Fighting Illini 
and 
a 
hard-

fought 
70-57 

win that the Terrapins first 
crossed Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico’s mind.

“I’m not really looking two 

games ahead,” Barnes Arico said. 
“I really wasn’t preparing for 
Maryland before Illinois because 
if you do that, especially our team, 
you lose focus of your opponent, 
and you’re going to lose.”

Barnes 
Arico 
and 
the 

Wolverines (5-3 Big Ten, 13-6 
overall) will have their hands full 
Thursday night when they take 
on No. 5 Maryland (8-0, 17-2).

But one advantage Michigan 

will have is its home crowd. The 

Wolverines have lost only once 
at home and have already posted 
key victories over Michigan State 
and Ohio State at Crisler Center.

“Our home crowd has just 

been tremendous,” Barnes Arico 
said Tuesday on WTKA radio. 
“And it’s getting better and better 
every game. I think there’s a buzz 
in the community and around 
campus about the way the team 
is playing.”

If there’s one player who will 

need to play well against the 
Terrapins, it’s senior forward 
Cyesha Goree, who has averaged 
20.5 points over her last five 
games.

“Cyesha 
has 
just 
been 

incredible,” Barnes Arico said. 
“She’s kind of been unstoppable 
against every opponent we’ve 
played so far, and I think a lot of it 
is due to her effort. She keeps on 
working and continues to go, go 
and go. She chases after rebounds 
on the other side of the court that 
I think nine other people can’t 
get. She’ll come up with them.”

Behind the arc, freshman 

guard Katelynn Flaherty has 
found her shot again of late, 
posting double-digit point totals 
the past two games.

On the other side of the court, 

Maryland coach Brenda Frese’s 
squad has been on fire. After 
losing to No. 4 Notre Dame on 
Dec. 3, the Terrapins have won 

11 straight games, including 
eight in the Big Ten, which puts 
them at the top of the conference 
standings.

Boasting the No. 6 scoring 

offense in the country with 82.8 
points per game, Maryland is 
led by guard Shatori Walker-
Kimbrough, 
who 
leads 
the 

Terrapins with 13.9 points per 
game.

Much 
like 
Michigan, 
the 

Terrapins have a dominant post 
presence. They boast two centers 
in 6-foot-3 Brionna Jones and 
6-foot-4 Malina Howard and are 
shooting 48.5 percent from the 
floor, good for fourth in the nation.

“I would say their biggest thing 

is they have such a great inside-
outside presence, and they’re 
big, strong and physical,” Barnes 
Arico said. “They’re playing 
extremely well right now.”

But as formidable of a task as 

it seems to take down the fifth-
ranked team in the country, there 
won’t be a lack of motivation for 
the Wolverines.

“It’s always nice to play 

one of the best teams in the 
country,” Goree said. “When we 
played Notre Dame, we had an 
experience to see where we were, 
how we were at our game. Now 
that we have a few more games 
under our belt, it’s always great 
to play a top-five team in the 
country.”

Editors note: Due to the legal 

sensitivity of the topic, some names 
have been changed.

I pulled into the parking lot 

of People’s Choice of Ann Arbor 
on a gray and slushy afternoon, 
equal parts excited and nervous to 
step into a medical marijuana dis-
pensary for the first time. A large 
purple wall greeted me in front of 
my windshield, featuring a large 
mural with the name of the estab-
lishment and the painted skyline 
of Ann Arbor. Sun-deprived from 
months with Michigan weather 
and kicking the snow from my 
boots, opening the door to the dis-
pensary provided a sensory explo-
sion to contrast the dreariness of a 
January afternoon: walls painted 
in warm hues of orange, reg-
gae playing softly on the waiting 
room speakers and that distinctive 
skunky smell.

Sarah, the manager of People’s 

Choice, greeted me promptly with 
a warm smile and a handshake, 
and gave me a tour of the store. We 
walked from the waiting room to 
the managerial office to the prod-
uct room, where shelves of vari-
ous marijuana strains sat behind 
a large glass cabinet filled with 
edibles (marijuana-infused food 
or candy products) and the walls 
were lined with pipes and bongs. 
The store in its entirety was mod-
est-sized, but what it lacked in size, 
People’s Choice made up for in 
coziness and comfort.

I was brought back to the pri-

vate office where I was introduced 
to owner and president of People’s 
Choice, Daryl. Sarah and Daryl, 
both soft-spoken and easygoing, 
radiate a vibe that rides the thresh-
old between humanitarian and 
business. They did not come into 
the medical cannabis business to 
find a legal way to help their friends 
get high, a stereotype enforced by 
years of dispensary raids on cop 
shows and Showtime’s addictively 
popular “Weeds.” In fact, that could 
not be farther from the truth. Both 
have personal histories of why they 
became acquainted and interested 
in the medicinal effects of marijua-
na due to watching loved ones suf-
fer from the effects of debilitating 
diseases and the harsh prescription 
pills that come with it.

“When I started five years ago, I 

had a true reason to jump into this 
business and try to help people who 
need it. My mother has MS (mul-
tiple sclerosis), and she tried dif-
ferent medications her whole life 
and nothing really worked,” Daryl 
said. “My cousin has RA (rheuma-
toid arthritis) very bad, and the 
first time I gave him medical can-
nabis he called me the next day and 
said, ‘Daryl, last night is the first 
time I slept through the night in 
three years.’ For that powerful of a 
statement to come out of someone’s 
mouth re-solidifies our purpose.”

Both Sarah and Daryl became 

involved in the medical canna-
bis industry in California when it 
became legalized in the state for 
medical purposes. Both Michigan 
natives, they returned after Michi-
gan voters passed the Michigan 
Medical Marijuana Initiative, also 
known as Proposal 1, which allows 
patients suffering from debilitating 
conditions, inscribed as including 
cancer, multiple sclerosis and HIV, 
to use marijuana with a Medical 
Marijuana Card. The store itself 
has been around since July 2010.

Before her introduction to the 

medical cannabis industry, Sarah’s 
husband had been suffering from 
substantial back pain and was try-
ing to find alternative treatment 
options. It’s the understanding 
of marijuana as a medicine that 
drives the work at People’s Choice, 
and the passion of helping others 
that encompasses the attitudes of 
Daryl and Sarah. The two believe 
that the general public’s changing 
attitudes toward medical cannabis 
has been greatly positive.

“I would say that the general 

population has really turned a cor-
ner,” Daryl said. “When medical 
marijuana first came out, I think 
there were a lot of questions like, 
‘Oh, is this really medicine?’ or, 
‘Does this really work?’ or, ‘Are 
these people just hippies trying to 
find a reason to get high?’ But as 
time goes on, more and more medi-

cal evidence comes out, and people 
are opening their eyes and saying, 
‘Wow, this is real medicine that is 
changing people’s lives daily.’”

And Daryl used science to back 

this up. THC, or tetrahydrocan-
nabinol, is the active physiologi-
cal compound naturally found in 
cannabis. This compound treats 
nausea in cancer patients and 
increases appetite, also called “the 
munchies.” CBD, or cannabidiol, 
is another active compound found 
in cannabis, which researchers 
say treats a wider range of disease 
than THC. Your brain does have 
cannabinoid receptors, which are 
associated with mood, appetite, 
pain sensation and memory. Your 
body, like many mammals, also 
produces cannabinoids naturally, 
which attach to these receptors. 
When a body ingests cannabis, the 
body can test positive for marijua-
na for around 30 days.

“When your body holds onto 

something for a month, like mari-
juana, it’s because it wants it. Your 
body has natural CBD receptors 
in it, pre-built in. When people 
understand this, they can under-
stand cannabis as a medicine and 
understand how it helps people.”

Lloyd Johnston, a distinguished 

senior research scientist at the 
University’s Institute for Social 
Research, has studied the effects 
of drug use on young people for 
decades. While he does believe 
the pro-medical testimonials of 
those suffering from certain ill-
nesses, Johnston is skeptical of 
laws increasing the availability of 
marijuana to the general public, as 
he still sees marijuana as a drug.

“The jury is still out on what 

all the consequences of marijuana 
are,” Johnston said. “We know it is 
very rarely lethal, but it does have 
the potential to create dependence, 
contrary to what was believed for 
some years. And there’s increasing 
evidence accumulating that it may 
interfere with brain development 
when used chronically in adoles-
cence and early adulthood, when 
the brain is still developing.”

Johnston is not convinced that 

medical marijuana will become 
legal nationwide, and sees an 
increase of non-medical use of the 
drug as an extraneous result of 
legalization for medical purposes.

“I’m not at all sure that (legal-

izing medical marijuana) is likely 
to happen,” Johnston said. “Young 
people have come to see marijuana 
as considerably less dangerous 
in recent years, no doubt in part 
because of the medical marijuana 
and legalization debates, and their 
use of it has been rising.”

Daryl disagrees with Johnston’s 

prediction of nationwide legaliza-
tion.

“There is not an inkling of 

doubt in my mind. About half in 
the Union is already in some stage 
of the medical level, so at some 
point the national government has 
to recognize that,” Daryl said. “I 
would say within the next three to 
five years we may see some sort of 
national marijuana policy change 
in favor of medical.”

Daryl cited a 2014 House of rep-

resentatives decision to limit the 
Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion from pursuing medical mari-
juana use in legal states. With help 
from high-profile physicians, like 
University alum Sanjay Gupta, a 
staunch medical cannabis advo-
cate, more people are being turned 
on to the idea that marijuana can 

be a medicine rather than a taboo.

“We see a lot of people who 

come in (to People’s Choice) for the 
first time and they feel the stigma, 
and are worried about what to 
expect,” Sarah said. “Once they 
realize that it’s no big deal, they 
can finally relax, and that attitude 
has definitely changed over the 
years as well.”

“You can go all the way from 

babies having seizures and give 
them a high CBD dose in medicine 
and their seizures will stop,” Daryl 
said. “You can look at an older per-
son with serious chronic pain who 
has been on Vicodin for years and 
it’s tearing up their GI tract. When 
they switch over to medical canna-
bis they get away completely from 
the Vicodin, and their GI tract will 
start to heal itself, and they’re actu-
ally starting to feel better because 
they aren’t dealing with the bad 
side effects of the narcotics.”

“We see examples of this daily,” 

Sarah added. “We’ll have a Crohn’s 
disease patient feeling sick and as 
soon as they start medicating they 
gain 40 pounds and they’re finally 
feeling healthy again. There are 
just countless stories like that.”

“From the outside looking in, 

it’s hard to see these examples 
because you don’t see the pain 
coming from these people’s faces,” 
Daryl said. “People come in cry-
ing, or they leave crying because 
they’re so elated, they’ll say, ‘Oh my 
God, I finally feel normal and well, 
instead of high off these narcotics, 
off the Oxycotin and the Vicodin,’ 
and they can go back into their 
lives and function again.”

The business of a medical 

marijuana dispensary is, according 
to Sarah and Daryl, not much 
different than that of any other 
local pharmacy. People’s Choice is 
a firm supporter of buying locally, 
and all the product within the 
store is Michigan grown. The glass 
pieces sold are almost all from 
local artists, and the pair pride 
themselves on being a Michigan-
based company.

“I’d say 90 percent of the 

operations are the same as any 
other business,” Daryl said. 
“You need to have a patient 
database, a record of every-
thing they’ve purchased, so it’s 
looked at in mostly a pharma-
ceutical light, which it should 
be. If it’s medicine, you need to 
treat it as such.”

People’s Choice relies on 

the help of volunteers for sec-
retarial functions and has a 
small paid staff, all of whom are 
required to hold Medical Mari-
juana Cards of their own, and 
well as to be licensed Medical 
Marijuana Caregivers.

“I’d say the volunteers who 

are drawn to this are somewhat 
humanitarian, in the sense that 
they see there’s a need for their 
help,” Daryl said. “And they’re 
willing to risk a little, if you will.”

The risk Daryl referred to was 

exemplified by an unexpected 
DEA raid on People’s Choice 
in August 2013. The event was 
traumatizing for the workers of 
the dispensary, but the owners 
fought and won their case against 
the federal agents, as there was 
nothing incriminating or illegal 
at the scene.

“The people working (at Peo-

ple’s Choice) at that time were 
here because they were willing 
to put themselves on the line in 
order to get people the medicine 
they need,” Daryl said.

As I finished my interview 

with Sarah and Daryl, I was filled 
with a sense of humanitarianism 
I did not expect from my experi-
ence at the dispensary. Walking 
back through the hallway I first 
came from, mentally saying good-
bye to the calming reggae and the 
poster of Bob Marley on the wall, 
I had nearly forgotten how gray 
and cold the world outside was.

EVENT PREVIEW

Folk Festival returns 
to Ann Arbor Friday

By CAROLYN DARR

Daily Arts Writer

This year, the much-loved local 

venue The Ark will have treated 
Ann Arbor to fantastic folk and 
roots music for 50 years. As a non-
profit organization, a great part of 
The Ark’s funding comes from its 
annual Folk Festival. This week-
end’s lineup will feature different 
artists on Friday and Saturday 
nights, including some big names 
such as Amos Lee, Ani DeFranco 
and Brandi Carlile.

The Ark was created in 1965; 

yet by 1977 the venue was having 
a hard time making ends meet. 
The idea for a fundraiser was 
conceived, and the format of a 
music festival was decided upon. 
The first Folk Festival took place 
at the Power Center in 1977, and, 
due to the proceeds from the 
fundraiser, The Ark was able 
to stay open another year. The 
Folk Festival quickly became an 
annual event that is still necessary 
for The Ark as an organization to 
survive. As a non-profit mostly 
staffed by volunteers, The Ark 
puts on over 300 shows a year. 
Barbara 
Authier, 
The 
Ark’s 

current 
Marketing 
Director, 

began as a volunteer herself.

“The Ark presents a pretty 

broad range of genres. We have 
blues and bluegrass and singer/
songwriter, 
and 
that 
whole 

gamut of rootsy Americana kind 
of music,” Authier said. “That’s 
a lot of different things and we 
want the (Folk Festival) bill each 
year to have a balance of those 
different styles. You want peo-
ple to have a taste of what the 
whole range of stuff is that we do 
throughout the year.”

The Folk Festival now takes 

place at Hill Auditorium, as The 
Ark only seats 400, and the Fes-
tival has grown much larger than 
that. Originally only one night, 
when Hill Auditorium was being 
renovated and the Festival had to 
be moved to the Michigan The-
atre, The Ark expanded it to two 
nights to accommodate the usual 

audience. Now, each evening fea-
tures separate artists, and the Fes-
tival usually sells out, with over 
7000 guests attending.

“We do book a couple of big 

name headliners that help draw 
people in that don’t know The 
Ark, and might not have heard 
of the other artists, but will 
come to see the big name and 
then discover something great,” 
Authier said. “So one goal is to 
bring in those big names to raise 
the money for the fundraiser. 
Then the other goal of the festi-
val is to introduce those smaller 
artists, the emerging artists or 
just lesser known people who 
play The Ark through the year. 
We try to achieve a balance 
between those big names, the 
unknowns and also local Michi-
gan artists.”

This year the Folk Festival 

will serve as a sort of home-
coming to some of the headlin-
ing artists who were featured 
at The Ark before they were 
famous. Amos Lee played at 
The Ark’s “Take a Chance 
Tuesday” Series before he was 
even signed to a label, and Ani 
DeFranco’s first show at The 
Ark hosted less than 20 people.

“We knew they were good, 

we know good music and we see 
it and then we put them in front 
of an audience. That’s part of 

our mission,” Authier said. “We 
work with these unknown art-
ists and then we stay with them 
through the arc of their career 
because the music is the most 
important thing.”

The Ark receives over 1200 

demos a year, and their pro-
gramming staff takes the time 
to listen and rate every single 
one. The Ark also hosts events 
like Open Stage where, once 
a month, artists can put their 
name in a drawing to play a few 
songs. Some artists are selected 
to host their own showcase or 
even to play the Folk Festival.

“It’s amazing music,” Authier 

said. “If you like music chances 
are there’s going to be some-
thing at the Folk Festival that 
you will like. Not everybody 
likes the same kind of music, 
and we’re a folk venue, it’s a folk 
festival, and everyone has this 
small idea of what that means 
to them, but our perspective on 
it is that it’s really huge. Folk 
isn’t a small thing, it’s a really 
wide range of different styles, 
so we’ve been talking about it 
as full spectrum folk, its every 
kind of thing. Our slogan for the 
last few years has been ‘Find 
Your Folk’ because whatever it 
means to you, you’ll probably 
find it at the Folk Festival. Find 
the music that you love.”

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Bizarre definitely lives up to 

his name and image in “Juice 
& Gin,” and 
not 
in 
the 

same 
way 

that the “Jus-
tin 
Bieber” 

music 
video 

was 
creepy 

and 
repug-

nant, but sim-
ply that it’s 
weird.

The 
video 
opens 
with 

Bizarre angrily playing with a 
lighter with a crazed expres-
sion on his face. There’s plenty 
of gin to be seen in the back-
ground of the studio — in still 
shots and in Bizarre’s hand. 
You can always count on 
Bizarre to appear drugged up.

“Juice & Gin” is also full of 

eye-catching fashion choices 
– in one scene, a furry purple 
bomber hat, no shirt and red 

gym shorts. In another shot, 
he’s leaning up against an 
apartment hallway wall, rock-
ing a t-shirt with “I pop molly, 
I don’t rock Tom Ford,” in bold, 
bright letters.

Cinematographically 

speaking, the video has an 
overabundance of film burns. 
I suppose they prove to be 
smooth, trippy transitions, 
but the effect is abused. The 

shots themselves are also 
headache 
provoking. 
The 

camera 
deliberately 
pans 

back and forth in a swift and 
shaky manner, out of sync 
with the slower paced song.

Bizarre adds a little bit 

of flavor with his expected 
antics, but in the end, “Juice & 
Gin,” proves to be an average, 
low-budget music video.

SINGLE REVIEW

“FourFiveSeconds” comes 

in 
the 
same 
fashion 
as 

Kanye’s “Only One.” Without 
the technical 
flashiness of 
pop or hip 
hop, the song 
finds its ele-
gantly 
sim-

ple 
tempo 

from just an 
acoustic gui-
tar for the 
chorus 
and 

keys for the 
bridge. Not only is this new 
Rihanna music — it is fresh 
Rihanna music.

It’s a song about keeping 

it together, whether for four 
to five seconds, until Friday 
or until you can make it back 
home. Lyrically, it’s relatable, 
finding its thematic roots in 
everyday struggle as opposed 
to the lavish lifestyles RiRi and 

Ye often sing about.

The track could feel absent 

without 
Paul 
McCartney’s 

great vocals, but its minimalist 
production is remarkable for 
the pop and rap stars. Typi-
cally characterized by heavy 
beats and techno synths, the 
unplugged sound McCartney’s 

production brings to Rihan-
na and Kanye is smooth and 
enriched, allowing the singers 
to show what they can really do.

As I type this, “I got three 

more days ‘til Friday,” and I 
plan on listening to “FourFi-
veSeconds” the entire time.

FILM COLUMN

The flaming swerve 
of visual storytelling

Mild spoilers to “Whiplash” 

and “Blue Ruin” ahead.

In perhaps the most gripping 

10 minutes of film released last 
year, there are no explosions. 
There is no 
rubble. 
No 

smoke. 
No 

gunshots. 
Smolder-
ing 
through 

in 
spasms 

between just 
three 
paltry 

lines of dia-
logue, there is 
only fire.

Terence 

Fletcher 
— 

a gargoyle of a jazz instructor 
whose 
educational 
technique 

would make most drill sergeants 
look like Mr. Rogers — piles the 
firewood high in the very first 
scene, but it’s his student who 
grinds the spark. Andrew Nei-
man does it alone, sitting behind 
his drum kit in those haunting 
10 minutes, a steady stream of 
sweat pouring down to mix with 
the halo of blood that surrounds 
his fevered hands, blurring with 
activity. It collects at the tip of 
his drumstick. It dribbles into a 
slight pool, the size of a silver dol-
lar, atop the drum’s batter head. 
And as when gasoline meets a 
struck match, hellfire emanates.

These 
are 
some 
of 
the 

thoughts, visceral and razor-
sharp, that hew through you in 
the closing moments of Damien 
Chazelle’s sophomore feature, 
“Whiplash.” Lyrical, pulpy imag-
ery belying the fact that there’s 
nothing even marginally poetic 
about the brand of screenwrit-
ing that inspires it. Chazelle’s 
script is a bare-bones, skeletal 
framework of dialogue that only 
reveals its pulse when Fletcher’s 
queued to pipe in, his cadence 
more symptomatic of dragon’s 
breath than spoken word.

The 
30-year-old 
Chazelle, 

whose Best Director snub at the 
Oscars sadly recalls the year a 
young Paul Thomas Anderson 
wasn’t nominated for “Boogie 
Nights,” understands the blank 
palette his no-frills script offers. 
He uses it. The visual storytell-
ing, on display in every corner of 
this movie, is breathtaking not 
just because the coloring and 
lighting garnishing it appears 
siphoned off an Edward Hopper 
painting. It’s also brutally effi-
cient in a way that leaves very 
little room for recoil (or, dare I 
say, whiplash) by the time the 
credits roll. Chazelle has you on 
board, then jumping out of your 
seat even though the seatbelt is 
fastened. This is the only movie 
I’ve ever seen in a theater that 
demanded I be there for the next 
showing. The ending inspires 
this fanatic kind of commitment, 
one bordering on a hit of cocaine. 
And it’s done without words.

Nothing about Chazelle’s char-

acters is obvious — nor should it 
be — but the story and visuals he 
constructs around them are tan-
gible in a way that’s rarely seen 
in American cinema. The best 
way to describe it involves being 
swept down a river while clutch-
ing a retail mannequin: There’s 
almost nothing to be derived 
from what’s in your hands, or the 
two guides Chazelle has written 
on screen. They’ve been placed 
here for utility, their intentions 
almost one-note to the point of 
fault, but there’s no questioning 
the exhilaration in how immedi-
ately, forcefully even, the young 
writer-director is able to shove 
us in the right direction, follow-
ing nothing but a current of bold 
filmmaking.

In 
that 
mesmerizing 
last 

scene, a jazz concert stage takes 
the place of a boxing ring. Nei-
man is the one doing all the hard 
work, but every drum stroke 
and rimshot takes the place of 
body blows he’s exchanging 
with Fletcher’s equally stubborn 
brand of savagery. One wants to 
prove his greatness, even if to no 
one else but himself. The other 
wants to prove he’s forging great-
ness, even if to no one else but 
himself. They’re a match made 
in heaven, an idea that comes 
to the forefront in those final 10 
minutes. But any bluntness this 
simplicity could imply is replaced 
by frenzied pacing, glowing, rov-
ing lighting and a type of edit-
ing that can only be described as 
seizure-inducing in the best way. 
The frame leaps from Fletcher to 
Neiman and back to Fletcher and 
back to Neiman and often settles 
right above him, reverberating 
with the breakneck tempo of the 
music while we watch his hands, 
in their dance from one drum to 
the next, do their best to mimic a 
hummingbird in flight.

In one brief shot, the camera 

sits right outside the drum kit 
and does nothing other than pan 
quickly left to right and back, 
like someone quickly shaking 
their head, or more accurately, 
eyes darting from one end of the 
page to the next. The effect, the 
sparkling verve, is emblematic 
of this closing act, though in a 
larger sense, the rest of the film 
as well.

The 100-minute runtime is 

full of brutal sections where 
we see nothing more than Nei-
man abusing himself to attain a 
quicker beat. In essence, hit the 
drums faster. He practices until 
he can do nothing more than 
scream obscenities at himself 
and little rivers of hemoglobin 
run from his fingers down his 
kit. It’s further stylized in a 
shot where Neiman slumps the 
bloodied hands into a pitcher 
of ice water, then as while the 
frame-rate increases, we see the 
clearness of the liquid slowly 

become an imposing red. The 
kicker, though, and what makes 
this picture a beacon of great 
visual storytelling is the image 
that comes right after: A high-
angle shot of Neiman’s face. 
Time has passed. It’s gaunt, bro-
ken under the eyes in a way that 
suggests manic turmoil.

It’s also efficient storytell-

ing — we’re still clutching to 
that blank mannequin with the 
vacant look on its face, but the 
current tells us exactly why 
we’re there, it lets us guess at 
what’s inside.

Another film that gained noto-

riety last year for its inventive 
use of visual plot development 
also centers on a lonely misfit. 
In writer-director Jeremy Saul-
nier’s “Blue Ruin,” Macon Blair 
plays Dwight, a homeless man 
emotionally devastated by his 
parents’ deaths who sets out for 
revenge after the killer is set 
loose. Over long stretches, the 
film features no dialogue, just 
Dwight’s 
perpetually 
aghast 

face as he plays a game of reverse 
cat and mouse with his targets. 
He almost seems surprised at his 
own confidence, and it’s the con-
fidence that, as in “Whiplash,” 
takes center stage.

We see it when Dwight steals 

a gun. Again when he stabs his 
target in the temple. And final-
ly, in the closing shots when he 
decides to die. The conviction 
in these films is a direct result 
of simplicity, something that’s 
often forgotten at the Ameri-
can box office these days to 
make room for bigger budgets 
and bigger ideas. “The Aveng-
ers” have their qualities but 
it would be hard to find more 
than a minute in the movie 
without Robert Downey Jr. try-
ing to push the plot along with 
a tersely worded insult. “Inter-
stellar” represented a hallmark 
in grand, breathtaking imag-
ery, a movie I loved, but again, 
it would be near-impossible to 
find a few seconds in its sprawl-
ing three hours without Mat-
thew McConaughey’s twang. 
Harder still to fish out any ideal 
in the film that dared be smaller 
than “what is the mathematical 
meaning of love?” Amazing as 
the final product is, you’d be 
hard-pressed to find a moment 
of pure catharsis in “Boyhood.”

By contrast, the movement 

and framing for Chazelle’s con-
cluding sequence is sealed off 
by an image so simple, so bril-
liant, I uttered an earnest “fuck 
yeah” on each viewing. Just 
two closeups of both charac-
ters exchanging a grin, in total 
understanding of one another 
and the fire they’ve scorched in 
our eyes. Fuck yeah, indeed.

Bongz & Thongs has served the Ann Arbor community since 2011.
Bongz & Thongz: A 
store like no other

By CHLOE GILKE

Managing Arts Editor

I’d never been in Bongz & 

Thongz before, but I went into this 
interview with some expectations. 
The store would probably be inex-
plicably hazy, with dim lighting 
and lots of tapestries. I didn’t know 
much about B&T, but I knew there 
would be bongs, and I knew the 
stereo would be blasting Sublime.

Upon entering the infamous 

store, I was immediately struck by 
how light it was. The huge front 
window illuminates a gorgeous 
and intricate interior, looking more 
like an artist’s gallery than the 
cave I so incorrectly imagined. My 
eyes were especially drawn to the 
elaborate paintings on the walls. 
Countless colors and illustrations 
dance across the interior of the 
Ann Arbor specialty shop, swirling 
and careening from wall to wall 
with the inscrutable beauty of a 
stoner’s dream. I had to ask about 
them. Store co-owner Mohammad 
Hassan, leaning comfortably on 
the counter and wearing a beanie 
and an easy smile, remarked that 
the wall art was “hand-painted, 
done by one guy.”

For Hassan, this dedication to 

artistry reaches far past the walls. 
Since it was established in 2011, 
Bongz & Thongz has supported 
local artists and glassblowers, sell-
ing only Michigan-made bongs 
and pipes. The merchandise is 
elaborate and beautiful — some 
of the bongs can run as expensive 
as $1,300, though many are more 
affordable.

“We 
hand-pick 
everything. 

We’re at a point where artists call 
us now, and we get to check out 
their stuff and make sure there 
are no flaws or any of that,” Has-
san said.

***

Hassan broke off from my inter-

view for a moment to help a young 
woman pick out a pipe. He showed 
her one shaped like a majestic ele-
phant, pointing out the details in 
its craftsmanship. I waited while 
they chatted, then interjected with 
more questions.

Hassan decided to open Bongz & 

Thongz because there weren’t any 
other stores like it in Ann Arbor. 
There was the Safe Sex Store on 
South University Avenue, but their 

merchandise didn’t include any-
thing like a hand-painted glass 
elephant pipe. Hassan noted the 
liberal attitude of the locals, and 
knew that the college atmosphere 
would be the ideal place to open 
this passion project.

“Why did I decide to open 

Bongz & Thongz? Well, you gotta 
do what you love,” Hassan said. 
“And Ann Arbor also fell in love 
with us.”

Locals embraced the store 

immediately, but the clientele isn’t 
just stoner college kids. Hassan 
remarked that his customers don’t 
fit any sort of profile.

“We get everyone from 18-year-

olds to almost dead,” Hassan 
explained. “People with walkers 
and wheelchairs come in and buy 
our pipes.”

But 
while 
the 
community 

embraced Bongz & Thongz, city 
officials took a little while to warm 
up. B&T faced several frustrating 
setbacks shortly after opening, 
mainly due to zoning ordinances 
limiting the sale of sex parapher-
nalia (the “Thongz” component of 
the store’s name). This was espe-
cially infuriating because the Safe 
Sex Store (just a few streets down) 
was able to sell similar merchan-
dise without any objection.

“(Some Ann Arbor city officials) 

didn’t think it was legal for us to 
sell dildos — we actually fought 
them on that,” Hassan said.

Though Bongz & Thongz did 

fight to include “Thongz” in 
their store, the basement space 
is currently empty. Get Curious 
With SafetyGirl, a city-approved 
sex shop, used to occupy the 
lower level of B&T, but since 
that store closed, Hassan and 
his associates are now seeking a 
new strategy.

“I don’t think we’re gonna 

(open a sex shop) again. We’re 
hoping to turn the basement into 
a vape lounge, where people can 
buy from upstairs and then hang 
out downstairs,” Hassan said.

So where does that leave 

Thongz? In the past, Bongz & 
Thongz used the space to sell 
costumes 
and 
non-genitalia-

related products, but Hassan 
looks forward to turning over 
a new leaf and converting the 
space into a vapor lounge.

“But I really want to try 

and keep (the store’s) name,” 
Hassan said.

***

After observing the elephant 

pipe, the young lady in the store 
inquired about a different one 
on another shelf. Hassan left me 
again to help her, and asked if she’d 
always had gauges (she had). The 
two conversed like old pals, but it 
was hard to feel like a third wheel 
because when he came back to our 
conversation, Hassan was just as 
warm and easygoing as he’d been 
with his customer.

“Bongz & Thongz is a family-

owned business. People tend to 
feel really at home here because 
we aren’t shy about what we are. 
We have a huge sign out front that 
says what we sell in here — people 
feel welcomed by our name,” Has-
san said.

Hassan knows he has the great-

est job in the world. Despite the 
difficulties the store faced early on, 
it’s grown into a well-established 
Ann Arbor staple today. Bongz & 
Thongz is the kind of place where 
a young lady with gauges and an 
old man in a wheelchair (and this 
uptight journalist) can all find 
beautiful art, unique merchandise 
and a family atmosphere. For Has-
san, that family atmosphere is the 
hallmark of his business.

“I love that I get to build a rela-

tionship with my customers every 
day,” Hassan said. “I just like to 
make people happy. In all my years 
working here, no one has ever left 
(the store) without a smile.”

***

Three guys burst into the 

store, momentarily illuminating 
the room with more of the bright 
Sunday afternoon glow from 
outside. But as the door swung 
closed, the friends relaxed. Bongz 
& Thongz may just be a store, but 
when it’s filled with hanging 
beads and eccentric artwork and 
cool people, it feels more like a 
friend’s house. Hassan extended 
his typical warm greeting to the 
three new customers.

“Hey guys, what can I help 

you with?”

I packed up my notebook and 

winter gear and left before I 
could hear an answer, but what-
ever Hassan helped these guys 
with, you can be sure they left the 
store with a smile.

EPISODE REVIEW

The meat locker. For those 

who don’t know, the meat 
locker is a television staple. 
It’s 
an 
epi-

sode 
where 

two 
charac-

ters, trapped 
within a con-
fined location, 
are forced to 
resolve 
their 

differences. 
It’s common, 
but when done 
right, can pro-
duce genuine 
humor 
and 

emotional payoff.

“Leslie and Ron” is one 

such episode where the two 
characters played by Amy 
Poehler 
(“Saturday 
Night 

Live”) and Nick Offerman 
(“The 
Lego 
Movie”) 
are 

forced to resolve the rift that 
has torn apart their ten-year 
friendship or “work proxim-
ity associate-ship” as Ron 
refers to it.

Written by series co-cre-

ator Michael Schur (“Brook-
lyn Nine-Nine”), the episode 
truly understands its charac-
ters as they’re locked in their 

old workplace.“Everything’s 
different,” 
Leslie 
notices. 

By jumping forward to 2017, 
“Parks and Rec” allows it’s 
characters to grow but “Les-
lie and Ron” looks at what 
people have lost.

While Poehler’s attempts 

as Leslie to crack Ron are 
fantastic (“Hey guys, Ron 
loves plastic!”) it’s Offerman 
who delivers the biggest rev-
elation in the episode. As he 
talks about everyone leav-
ing the Parks Department he 
says, “One day, I looked up. 
Just didn’t recognize any-

one.” Offerman’s delivery is 
subtle and heartbreaking, as 
Leslie realizes, “You missed 
your friends.” In their old 
office, Leslie sees the friend-
ship that was left behind as 
Ron reflects on that inevita-
bility: “It was a punctuation 
mark on a sentence that had 
already been written.”

This moment of honesty 

defines the episode, show-
ing the true heart behind the 
characters of “Parks and Rec.” 
It will truly be a loss when TV 
moves on without the show.

TRAILER REVIEW

The trailer for “A Most Vio-

lent Year,” a Valencia-filtered 
introduction 
to 
the 
tense 

crime-drama, 
leaves 
the 

viewer long-
ing for more. 
Set in 1981, 
statistically 
one 
of 
the 

most 
violent 

years in New 
York City his-
tory, the dra-
ma-thriller follows the dealings 
of businessman Abel Morales, 
(Oscar Isaac, “Inside Llewyn 
Davis”) as he successfully tries 
to expand his Brooklyn-based 
company.

Violence infiltrates Morales’s 

idealistic life when his driv-
ers start getting assaulted and 
deadly threats are made. To 
combat the brutality, the Dis-
trict Attorney (David Oyelowo, 

“Selma”) begins to investigate 
the business, finding more than 
anyone bargained for. It seems 
that some of the qualms of the 
legitimacy of the business come 
from Morales’s wife, played by 
Jessica Chastain, (“Interstel-
lar”) who substitutes her signa-
ture red locks but maintains a 
fiery disposition in her desper-
ate protection of her husband, 

children and reputation.

The trailer builds on the sus-

picions and tensions off which 
the talented cast can play. By 
the end, it is impossible to know 
where all the scheming and 
violence are coming from, but 
the trailer pulls us in enough 
to make us wonder where it’s 
going.

LSA junior Ian Perfitt performs as Neighbourhood!. 

Ian Perfitt blends 

creative and 

analytical thinking 

in his music

BY CAROLINE FILIPS

Daily Arts Writer

LSA junior Ian Perfitt is the 

ideal convergence of the left-
brain/right-brain theory on per-
sonality — he has a palpable zeal 
for music and thoughtful inten-
tions to maintain equilibrium 
within all aspects of his life.

Though debated in terms of 

its validity, the evidence behind 
the postulate suggests people are 
either predominantly right-or 
left-brained thinkers. It attempts 
to justify why some are more 
creative, abstract thinkers (right-
brained), while others are more 
logical and conceptually-minded 
(left-brained). The theory poses a 
reasonable explanation as to why 
we are the way we are, or why 
Perfitt enjoys the University’s 
rigorous physics curriculum and 
maintains a passion for music. 
Theoretically, the convergence of 
the two would be a well rounded 
individual much like Perfitt.

As a physics major and musi-

cian, Perfitt maintains a balance 
between the realm of explainable 
scientific theories and the intan-
gible euphoria of the creative 
process. In the spirit of his per-
sonal mantra to stay balanced, 
Perfitt lives out his motto. When 
asked which route he intends to 
pursue 
professionally, 
Perfitt 

declared his love of physics.

“I’m passionate about it, and it 

will also pay the bills, hopefully,” 
Perfitt said. “Music is my less 
heady thing, and physics is my 
heady thing, so I keep a balance 
with that.”

Primarily the project of his 

girlfriend, Music, Theater & 
Dance senior Summer Krin-
sky, and his friend Sam Naples, 
a SMTD senior, Perfitt dabbles 
in drumming and vocals for the 
band Caves. However, he ulti-
mately prefers to stay out of the 
limelight of performing, and is 
recording a solo album instead.

“I’ve done a lot of performing 

in the past, and not to say that 
I’ve been there, done that, but if 
I don’t have to perform that’s fine 
with me,” Perfitt said. “With my 
solo stuff, I’m not very interested 
in performing right now. When I 
write songs, I’ll play them around 
the house, that’s my performing. 

I don’t need to make it a big deal 
on a stage. For now, that’s just 
me.”

Perfitt began his studies at the 

University last semester after 
transferring from Washtenaw 
Community College, yet his love 
of music began at an early age. 
Perfitt believes his appreciation 
for the craft runs in his blood, as 
he grew up in a musically minded 
family where all of his uncles are 
musicians.

“One of my first memories 

was dancing to Elvis Costello 
records with my mom in the 
house I grew up in,” Perfitt 
said. “I took drum lessons 
pretty early, my parents signed 
me up for lessons at age four, 
but I wasn’t old enough to focus 
on it and understand what was 
going on, so I didn’t start until 
I was nine and got more serious 
about it.”

By his junior year of high 

school, Perfitt devoted the vast 
majority of his time to recording. 
He became serious about drum-
ming, branched out to other 
instruments, added vocals to his 
repertoire and also recorded an 
album. But at times, Perfitt felt 
out of balance.

“I wrote a lot of music, took 

a lot of breaks,” Perfitt said. 

“Sometimes you get exhausted 
working on songs all the time.”

That balanced attitude that 

permits 
Perfitt’s 
academic 

interests to coexist with his 
hobbies also extends to his 
music. Spanning from “Babe 
Has Got a Black Heart,” the 
electronic jam influenced by 
music of the ’50s and ’60s, to 
the deeper lyrics and harmonic 
structure of “Roots,” Perfitt’s 
SoundCloud 
showcases 
his 

impressive range.

He doesn’t subject his music 

to one distinct genre, but rather 
attempts to classify his tracks 
by the differing moods and 
emotions that inspired them.

“A lot of my music has deep, 

intellectual things and then 
some have some more shallow, 
feel-good, upbeat elements to 
them,” Perfitt said. “Usually it’s 
things that I’m struggling with, 
those are usually my deeper 
songs, and then I’ll have songs 
where my girlfriend will say 
stuff to me that inspires a song 
and there’s also just things that 
I just enjoy writing about.”

When asked of his song-

writing process, Perfitt sim-
ply replied, “Write, record, 
release,” exhibiting his left-
brained 
pragmatism, 
which 

followed up with a refined, 
right-brained explanation.

“Sometimes it just comes to 

me,” he said. “It’s so fascinating 
how you can sit down and come 
up with this idea, and a lot of 
times you don’t even know 
where you get the idea from 
and then to expand upon this 
idea and create something that 
moves people, moves yourself 
and no one knows how or 
why they’re moved. No one 
understands. It’s so fascinating 
to me.”

Once he runs with an idea, 

he writes a song in full with 
what he refers to as “scratch 
lyrics, or lyrics that don’t make 
any sense,” to fill the place of a 
melody and structure an out-
line. He later returns to and 
polishes up the lyrics and adds 
the drums and acoustic instru-
ments, and lastly electronics.

Yet without sufficient inspi-

ration, Perfitt cannot begin his 
creative venture. He mainly 
seeks creative fuel from his 
favorite artists and bands.

“My 
biggest 
influence 

is 
Baths, 
an 
electronic 

musician with a unique style, 
but sometimes I think his 
songwriting could be better, so I 
tap into people like the Beatles, 
who I think write great songs 
that inspire me to write songs, 
but then sometimes I feel like 
their lyrics are too shallow,” 
Perfitt said. “So, I like people 
like Bob Dylan and his style of 

lyricism. Sometimes I feel like 
all of that is not harmonically 
deep enough so I like Nick 
Drake a lot.”

He also accredits his artistic 

drive to his many, insightful 
conversations with the muse of 
his work, his girlfriend.

“I’ve written about just being 

with my girlfriend because 
that’s so important to me,” 
Perfitt said.

He hinted that his song, 

“Today,” was written about their 
time spent together, stating it’s 
about two fictional characters 
contentedly passing time and 
sitting on the beach.

Though an admirer of music’s 

legends and the newcomers 
alike, Perfitt is mindful of possi-
ble accusations of imitation, and 
in turn strives for absolute origi-
nality in his musical endeavors.

“I have a couple songs that 

sound like Beatles songs, but 
then I try to make them not 
sound as much like Beatles 
songs,” Perfitt said. “I would 
never want to write a song that 
sounds like Paul (McCartney) or 
someone wrote it. I think that 
everyone has their own expres-
sion, so they should try to tap 
into that, however you do that. 
I’ll think, ‘Where did my most 
original thought come from, and 
how can I keep them coming?’ ”

An enthusiast of the wisdom 

that follows from making mistakes, 
Perfitt recognizes the importance 
of trial and error in his songwrit-
ing that leads him towards person-
al growth in the craft.

“It’s important to tell myself, 

‘Oh, that’s just an OK song, I’m 
not going to put that out, because 
I know something better will 
come,’ and once that better 
thing comes, you end up releas-
ing something better,” he said. 
“Learning how to skip things 
that are just ‘OK’ is better for 
you, because then you produce 
something better. I’ve become a 
lot more picky with things and I 
think that’s important.”

Aside from his interests in 

physics and music, Perfitt also 
satisfies his creative desires with 
drawing. His favorite form of the 
craft is abstract expressionism, 
due to its open interpretation 
and lack of convention.

“I got into the whole drawing 

phase of my life and I remember 
making a lot of abstract draw-
ings,” Perfitt said. “I emailed a 
UM art professor and I wanted 
to show him my work and see if 
he could teach me some stuff. 
I brought my work to him in a 
coffee shop and he just kind of 
flipped through my stuff and I 
don’t think he really liked it that 
much at all.”

Though criticized for his 

own perception of art, Perfitt 

concluded that the meeting 
with the professor was pivotal 
in both his personal and artistic 
development.

“At the time, I didn’t really 

have a full realized idea of what 
my art was meaning, but after 
that, I learned that I wanted 
to start figuring out drawing 
things that have meaning, or 
putting more meaning into my 
art, whether its music or draw-
ing,” Perfitt said. “I also real-
ized that I didn’t necessarily 
need to listen to him because 
we just had different styles. 
He was an art professor, so he 
probably knew a lot more than 
me, but I remember at that same 
coffee shop he pulled out one 
of his drawings, and it was just 
a drawing of a cat. I thought it 
was cool, just not the only way 
to make art.”

When I felt our interview was 

nearing its end, I asked Perfitt 
if he had anything else to add. 
His response was, yet again, an 
example of his stimulating intel-
lect and commendable creativ-
ity.

Perfitt began describing the 

math term of neighbourhood, 
which inspired his SoundCloud 
name, albeit minus the ‘u’ and 
plus an exclamation point; and 
like any outstanding mathema-
tician, he applied the term to 
everyday life … and then some.

“It’s a set of points that are a 

certain distance from a given 
point It’s used for calculating 
limits,” Perfitt said. “At that time 
I was thinking about how a lot of 
structures we have of reality and 
theories of science are similar to 
a neighbourhood in that they’re 
a set of ideas that are a certain 
distance from what things in 
reality actually are.”

The 
dual 
connotation 
of 

neighborhood, 
that 
being 

a community of family and 
friends, was also related to 
Perfitt’s title choice.

“Whenever I’m having trou-

ble or in a bad place, not the 
happiest, whatever, I have this 
neighborhood 
community 
of 

friends and family to fall back on 
and they can help me cheer up,” 
Perfitt said. “The factorial sign 
at the end of ‘Neighborhood!’ 
came up from a conversation I 
was having with my girlfriend 
about taking a series of experi-
ences that you’ve had and taking 
that factorial that adds them up 
and shows all the different com-
binations they could occur in.”

For now, those wishing to 

hear the sequence of events that 
led to Neighborhood! can lis-
ten to Perfitt’s SoundCloud of 
demos. He is also planning to 
release the demo, “Kiss and Cry 
Benches”, and one finalized, 
mastered demo of “Today.”

LITERARY COLUMN

When authors are 

assholes

“It is easier to forgive an 

enemy than to forgive a friend.” 
–William Blake

You can say that again, Will.
A column of mine that ran 

on 
Nov. 

11, 
2014 

entitled 
“Finally, 
A 
Series 

of 
Very 

Fortunate 
Events,” 
revolved 
around my 
enthusi-
asm for the 
upcoming television adaption of 
Daniel Handler’s, aka Lemony 
Snicket’s A Series of Unfortu-
nate Events, and included my 
praise for Handler’s unique 
writing style.

A few days later on Nov. 19 

at the annual National Book 
Awards, Handler made a rac-
ist joke after African-American 
author Jacqueline Woodson won 
an award for her novel “Brown 
Girl Dreaming.”

Handler subsequently apolo-

gized via Twitter and matched 
donations to “We Need Diverse 
Books,” an organization dedi-
cated to addressing the lack of 
diversity within children’s lit-
erature. However, many people, 
myself included, were still left 
with a bad taste in our mouths.

While I won’t retract my 

praise for Handler’s writing 
ability, I admit I was embar-
rassed to have so publicly com-
plimented someone who could 
make such offensive and igno-
rant comments.

I debated for a while whether 

to even write on this incident, 
as it occurred some months ago 
and largely faded from the pub-
lic discussion. Nevertheless, I 
believe it raises age-old ques-

tions about our understandings 
of and interactions with art. 
Namely, where is the divid-
ing line between art and artist? 
Does such a line even exist?

Whenever this topic comes 

up, there are always those who 
deride thinking too deeply on 
art as an extension of the art-
ist. They look at works of art as 
sensory, and thus objective. In 
this interpretation, authenticity 
of reaction is based solely on the 
visceral experience of the view-
er. In other words, your enjoy-
ment of a book, movie, album, 
etc. can be wholly separated 
from your knowledge of the art-
ist’s character.

Unfortunately, this opinion 

all too often mutates into a 
perverse form of hero-worship, 
in which the memories of 
pleasure 
in 
a 
viewer 
are 

privileged above those whose 
experiences, and, in fact, very 
existence are made vulnerable 
by the artist’s bigotry.

To me, the interaction with 

art, whether through watching a 
movie, reading a book or gazing at 
a painting, is an intimate experi-
ence between viewer and artist. 
It is an encountering of souls, in 
which both parties give and take, 
with the actual work serving as a 
conduit of sorts.

Thus, when a favorite artist, 

someone we believe to have both 
known and been known by, dis-
appoints us, the betrayal is that 
much more intense.

Examples of such betray-

als abound, though of a more 
extreme nature, like the pedo-
philia 
and 
rape 
allegations 

against Woody Allen and charges 
against Roman Polanski, and the 
current debates over the broad-
casting of “The Cosby Show” 
amid the numerous rape accusa-
tions against Bill Cosby.

Focusing again on literature, 

there is an unhappy excess of 
cases, both contemporary and 
historical, in which the prejudices 
of the author spark conversation 
around denouncing their work.

Recently, the film “Ender’s 

Game,” based on a science fiction 
novel of the same name, was boy-
cotted by many in the LGBTQ and 
ally community over the overtly 
homophobic views and remarks 
of the author Orson Scott Card.

The 
situation 
becomes 

even more convoluted when 
we look to authors of the 
past. 
Racism, 
sexism, 
anti-

Semitism, xenophobia — almost 
no historical author is left 
unmarked by these prejudices. 
Even 
authors 
that 
seemed 

impressively 
progressive 
in 

some areas are often revealed 
to 
have 
been 
horrifyingly 

intolerant in others.

L. Frank Baum, the author of 

“The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,” 
was a strong supporter of wom-
en’s suffrage and gender equality. 
He also condoned the wholesale 
genocide of Native Americans.

Jack London, author of “The 

Call of the Wild,” was a passion-
ate advocate for worker’s rights 
and for the prevention of cruelty 
to animals. He was also a sup-
porter of violent, racially based 
colonialism.

As a society, we tend to excuse 

the humanitarian failings of his-
torical figures. We hem and haw 
about looking at the orthodoxi-
cal context and prevailing social 
norms of the time. We say they 
couldn’t have known better.

But what differentiates some-

one from being labeled a “product 
of the times” to being recognized 
as plainly hateful? Is it the depth 
of their convictions? The amount 
of divergence from the popular 
opinion of the time? The quality 

of their work?

I don’t have the answers to 

these questions. I’m not sure what 
the correct course of action is 
when we confront such issues.

I think it is essential to acknowl-

edge and discuss the ethical fail-
ings of artists we very often place 
on pedestals. I do not believe, 
however, that the ultimate answer 
is to simply not read authors with 
problematic views or histories.

I think the solution lies in part 

in reading the works of the “Oth-
ers,” those attacked, marginalized 
groups grappling with the injus-
tices of both the past and pres-
ent. Through their stories we can 
encounter their souls, and hope-
fully we may see the humanity 
that has too often been denied.

As a literary community, we 

can also continue to stand up 
and speak out against harmful 
remarks like those made by Han-
dler, which seek to belittle and 
erase those diverse voices fighting 
to be heard in mainstream pub-
lishing.
