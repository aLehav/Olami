Formula assesses 

complications 
in bone marrow 

recipients

By PARISHA NOVA

Daily Staff Reporter

University researchers have 

developed a new testing sys-
tem that can improve care for 
patients who need bone marrow 
and stem cell transplants.

Graft-versus-host disease is a 

life-threatening condition that 
can occur in response to trans-
plants. GVHD causes immune 
cells from the transplant to 
attack the body’s healthy tissue. 
In patients with diseases such as 
leukemia, which compromises 
the body’s immune system, bone 
marrow or stem cell transplants 
are necessary.

John Levine, professor of 

pediatrics and the study’s lead 
author, said in these types of 
cases, GVHD is a real danger.

“Following 
transplantation 

surgeries, our major concern is 
the development of GVHD in our 

patients,” Levine said. “How-
ever, it is difficult to predict the 
severity of GVHD at the onset of 
the symptoms as it varies from 
patient to patient.”

Prior to the research, there 

was no method for determining 
the severity of a GVHD case and 
whether or not it needed treat-
ment. The treatment involves 
high doses of medication that 
reduce immune activity, so doc-
tors must be extremely cautious 
when treating GVHD. Levine 
and his co-investigators assessed 
nearly 800 patients and created 
a scoring system that uses three 
proteins to assess the severity of 
each case of the disease.

“We found out that it was 

not one protein but a combina-
tion of three recently validated 
biomarkers TNFR1, ST2, and 
Reg3a,” Levine said. “We then 
formulated an equation which 
computes the concentration of 
the biomarkers into three Ann 
Arbor scores. The scores are 
positively correlated with the 
amount of risk the diagnosed 
patient is in, so a score 1 indicates 
a patient with minimal risk while 
a patient diagnosed with a score

Stephanie Chang 
becomes inaugural 
Asian-American 
woman in House 

By DYLAN BENNETT

For the Daily

When the Michigan Legis-

lature kicked off a new session 
Wednesday, the House floor 
included a number of new faces, 
including state Rep. Stepha-
nie Chang (D–Detroit), the first 
Asian-American woman to serve 
in the Michigan House of Repre-
sentatives.

Earning a bachelor’s degree 

in Psychology at the Univer-
sity in 2005, she said the skills 
she developed through student 
leadership roles on campus ulti-
mately gave her the confidence 
and experience to run for state 
representative.

“When I was on campus 

around the time of 2005, the 
Supreme Court case on affirma-
tive action was going on, and I 
was involved in an organization 
of students supporting affirma-
tive action,” Chang said. “We 
mobilized people to get on buses 
to go to D.C. It was really a train-
ing ground for me in terms of 
learning how to organize and 
practice 
coalition 
building 

skills.”

After graduating in 2005, 

Chang became a community 
organizer in Detroit. While liv-
ing on the city’s east side, she 
served as an assistant to Grace 
Lee Boggs, an influential Asian-
American political activist, and 
as a mentor with the Detroit 
Asian Youth Project. She said 
her experiences at the University 
prepared her for these tasks.

“A lot of the things I did in 

college really helped prepare me 
to learn how to organize, build 
relationships and how to really

Ta-Nehisi Coates 
lectures on slavery, 

discrimination 

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Members of the University 

community crowded Rackham 
Auditorium Wednesday evening 

to hear acclaimed journalist Ta-
Nehisi Coates discuss the his-
tory and institutionalization of 
anti-Black racism in America.

“In this country, we believe 

racism to be a kind of psycho-
sis,” he told the crowd. “A kind 
of insanity, a sort of inexplicable 
madness.”

Coates, a senior editor for The 

Atlantic, spoke about his widely 
discussed Atlantic cover story, 

“The Case for Reparations,” 
which examines the historical 
oppression of Blacks in the Unit-
ed States.

The speech, part of the Uni-

versity’s 
month-long 
Martin 

Luther King Jr. Symposium, was 
sponsored by the Institute for 
Research on Women and Gen-
der along with the Department 
for Afroamerican and African 
Studies, the Ford School of Pub-

lic Policy and the Center for the 
Education of Women. Some stu-
dents and faculty were turned 
away before the event began 
because the auditorium was at 
capacity.

“I hope to provoke people; 

I hope to give them what they 
brought me here to do,” Coates 
said in an interview with The

University receives 

grant from AAA 
Foundation for 
Traffic Safety 

By KATIE PENROD

For the Daily

The AAA Foundation for Traf-

fic Safety granted the Univer-
sity 
Transportation 
Research 

Institute a contract to conduct 
research on the effects of age on 
driving. The University’s con-
tract, as well as a similar contract 
given to Columbia University, will 
fund research in New York, Mary-
land, Colorado and California.

Research Prof. David Eby, head 

of the Behavioral Sciences Group 
at UMTRI, will serve as the co-
principal 
investigator 
on 
the 

UMTRI portion of the project. 
The project will last five years and 
address topics such as the effects 
of medication on driving behav-
ior and outcomes. The pilot of the 
study will begin in the spring.

SCIENCE
Researchers 
to assess age 
correlation 
with driving


United States, graduate students 
from the University of Ottawa, 
McMaster University and McGill 
University have been working on 
a similar study called “Candrive.”

UMTRI is one of five sites for 

the study, but will be fully respon-
sible for collecting and analyzing 
GPS data from every site. Every 
participant will have a GPS in their 
car to track their driving patterns, 
and the investigators will also con-
duct annual assessments and inter-
views of participants. Prior to the 
study, the investigators will col-
lect data on participants’ medical, 

crash and driving history records.

According to a press release, 

3,000 people aged 65 to 79 will 
participate, 
and 
UMTRI 
will 

recruit and observe 600 partici-
pants. Investigators will observe 
participants’ driving patterns and 
consider individual health factors, 
such as medication taken.

“When completed, this combi-

nation of data on individuals over 
time will be an extremely power-
ful tool to better understand older 
drivers,” Lindsay Ryan, assistant 
research scientist at the Survey 
Research Center in the University 
Institute for Social Research and 
one of the principal investigators 
for the Michigan site of the study. 
“While this is an extremely ambi-
tious project in scale and scope, the 

team of experts leading the efforts 
have an excellent track record and 
are well-prepared to complete this 
work.”

Dr. Raymund Yung and Linda 

Nyquist, of the University Institute 
of Gerontology, will be working 
with the principal investigators to 
recruit participants.

Nyquist said all participants 

must be residents of Ann Arbor and 
already receive health care from 
the University Health System.

“Age is the biggest risk fac-

tor for many common diseases 
such as arthritis, memory loss 
and movement disorders,” Yung 
said. “All of which are factors 
that may result in an older driver 
deciding to continue to drive or 
not.”

Diplomats agree 
on dividing line for 
countries to remove 

weapons 

BERLIN (AP) — Diplomats 

from Russia and Ukraine agreed 
Wednesday on a dividing line 
from where both sides should 
pull back their heavy weapons, 
just hours after separatist forces 
deployed more arms and man-
power to an emerging flashpoint 
in eastern Ukraine.

Germany’s Foreign Minis-

ter, who hosted a meeting of 
his counterparts from Russia, 
Ukraine and France, said the 
four parties had agreed that 
the demarcation line defined 
in the Minsk agreement of last 
year should form the basis for 
the withdrawal. Under the plan, 
Ukraine and the pro-Russian 

separatists would pull back 
their heavy arms 15 kilometers 
(9 miles) on either side of the 
line, though there was no agree-
ment on a withdrawal of all 
troops.

“Today we have finally agreed 

that the demarcation line men-
tioned in the Minsk agreement 
is the line from where the with-
drawal of heavy weapons needs 
to take place now,” German 
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter 
Steinmeier told reporters after 
the meeting in Berlin.

Steinmeier said the agree-

ment had been “difficult work” 
and the talks, which follow a 
fruitless round of negotiations 
last week, were “testing the 
patience of all involved.” The 
parties also agreed that the con-
tact group of Ukraine, Russia, 
and the OSCE should meet as 
soon as possible with the aim of 
laying further groundwork for a 
high-level meeting in Kazakh-

stan’s capital Astana aimed at 
reaching a long-lasting settle-
ment.

Separately, 
Russian 
For-

eign Minister Sergey Lavrov 
said the “strong support” for 
the pullback was the meeting’s 
most important result. He said 
the foreign ministers did not 
discuss the sanctions that the 
West has imposed on Russia 
over the Ukraine crisis, saying: 
“The sanctions are not our prob-
lem, it is the problem of those 
who introduced them and now 
do not know how to extricate 
themselves ...”

Earlier Wednesday, Lavrov 

had urged measures to contain 
the unfolding unrest, but said 
nothing about the rebels surren-
dering territory they acquired 
in violation of a peace deal con-
cluded in September in Minsk, 
Belarus. Ukraine says separatist 
forces that are backed by Russia 
have overstepped agreed-upon 
front-line boundaries between 
the warring sides by 500 square 
kilometers (190 square miles).

A fresh separatist advance is 

under way in an area northwest 
of Luhansk, the second-largest 
rebel-held city. The fighting is 
centered on two checkpoints 
along a strategic highway.

Ukraine’s 
Defense 
Minis-

try said one of those positions, 
Checkpoint 31, had been aban-
doned but that operations were 
underway to retake it.

The separatist forces appear 

well-poised to take the upper 
hand, however.

An Associated Press reporter 

saw nine Gvozdika self-pro-
pelled howitzers and six anti-
tank cannons moving near the 
town of Perevalsk around mid-
day. A rebel militiaman with 
the convoy who declined to give 
his name said the armament 
was heading in the direction of 
Checkpoint 31.

Along the same road, the AP 

saw four Grad multiple rocket 
launchers accompanied by four 
trucks carrying ammunition

Video shines light 
on police shooting 

of Jerame Reid

BRIDGETON, N.J. (AP) — 

With the dashboard camera 
in their cruiser rolling, police 
pulled a Jaguar over for run-
ning a stop sign on a dark night. 

But things suddenly turned 

tense when one of the officers 
warned his partner that he 
could see a gun in the glove 
compartment.

Screaming over and over 

“Don’t you f---ing move!” and 
“Show me your hands!” at the 
man in the passenger seat, the 
officer reached into the car and 
appeared to remove a silver 
handgun.

Then, the passenger, despite 

being warned repeatedly not 
to move, stepped out of the 
Jaguar, his hands raised about 
shoulder level.

The officers opened fire, 

killing him.

The video of the Dec. 30 

killing of Jerame Reid in 
Bridgeton, a struggling, mostly 
minority city of 25,000 people 
just south of Philadelphia, was 
released this week, raising 

questions and stirring anger 
over another death at the hands 
of police.

The 
nearly 
two-minute 

deadly standoff came after the 
killings of black men in New 
York and Ferguson, Missouri, 
triggered months of turbulent 
protests, violence and calls for 
a re-examination of police use 
of force.

Reid and the man driving the 

car were black. 

The Bridgeton officer who 

spotted 
the 
gun, 
Braheme 

Days, is black; his partner, 
Roger Worley, is white. 

Both 
officers 
have 
been 

placed on leave while prosecu-
tors investigate.

“The video speaks for itself 

that at no point was Jerame 
Reid a threat and he possessed 
no weapon on his person,” 
Walter 
Hudson, 
chairman 

and founder of the civil rights 
group the National Awareness 
Alliance, said Wednesday. 

“He complied with the offi-

cer and the officer shot him.”

A Philadelphia lawyer, Con-

rad Benedetto, said he has been 
hired by Reid’s wife, Lawanda, 
to investigate. 

He said in a statement the 

footage “raises serious ques-

tions as to the legality and/or 
reasonableness of the officers’ 
actions that night” because 
Reid was shot as he raised his 
hands.

Reid, 36, spent about 13 years 

in prison for shooting at three 
state troopers when he was a 
teenager. 

And Days knew who he was; 

Days was among the arrest-
ing officers last year when 
Reid was charged with several 
crimes, including drug posses-
sion and obstruction.

In Bridgeton, where two-

thirds of the residents are black 
or Hispanic, the killing has 
stirred small protests over the 
past couple of weeks, including 
a demonstration on Wednes-
day, a day after the video was 
made public at the request of 
two newspapers under the 
state’s open records law.

The 
Cumberland 
County 

prosecutor’s office previously 
said a gun was seized during 
the stop but would not com-
ment further on the investiga-
tion. 

Bridgeton police would not 

answer any questions about the 
video and said they opposed its 
release as neither “compassion-
ate or professional.”

riences with mental health.

In an e-mail interview with 

The Michigan Daily, Fayhee 
said prior to the pilot program, 
33 percent of University stu-
dents would seek help for men-
tal illness, compared to only 
10 percent of student-athletes. 
She decided to get involved and 
share her experiences after 
meeting Heininger.

“We found that we faced 

similar pressures, but those 
pressures 
just 
manifested 

themselves in different ways,” 
Fayhee wrote. “Knowing I 
was not alone in what I went 
through and that I should not 
be ashamed of my struggles 
was what motivated me. I came 
to realize that helping break 
down the stigmas surrounding 
mental health trumped hiding 
my struggles.”

Additionally, Heininger said 

there is a “tough it out” stig-
ma among athletes, and this 
program aims to break that 
down. He said mental health 
issues are not all together dif-
ferent from physical injuries, 
and emphasized that the mind 

affects everything we do.

Barbara 
Hansen, 
athletic 

medical staff counselor, said 
the athletes had a significant 
impact on the students who 
participated.

“I think one of the more 

powerful, common reactions 
we’ve had is that students felt 
like they could really relate 
to the videos and stories from 
Will and Kally,” Hansen said.

The pilot program is part 

of a wider effort that began 
in October. At that time, the 
collaborators began holding 
drop-in meetings facilitated by 
a clinical social worker. At the 
meetings, Hansen said athletes 
completed surveys focused on 
mental wellness.

Hansen 
said 
they 
have 

resumed the groups for the 
winter semester, and are in the 
planning stages for the next 
academic year. As a result of 
the pilot, 40 students met with 
counselors.

“Feedback about the videos 

was overwhelmingly positive,” 
Hansen said. “It definitely 
opened up the door for some of 
our current student-athletes to 
decide to reach out for help.”

Q&A EDITORS | QUEER IN ACTION

Coming out: Q&A’s first Q&A

ent issues,” Chang said. “A lot of 
those skills will serve me in the 
legislature as well.”

After being asked to run for 

state representative in the 6th 
District by her predecessor, for-
mer State Rep Rashida Tlaib, 
Chang had to determine if her 
race was going to impede her 
ability to win in a predominantly 
Black city.

“What really became clear 

on the campaign trail was that 
people want someone who shares 
their values and someone they 
can trust and someone they know 
can work really hard for them,” 
she said.

Chang’s district had tradition-

ally elected a diverse array of peo-
ple to leadership positions. Past 
representatives include a Pales-
tinian woman, a Jewish man, a 
Mexican American woman and a 
Hungarian woman.

In her position, Chang rep-

resents a significant portion of 
Downtown, Corktown and South-
west Detroit and a small section 
of the near east side stretching 

from Interstate-375 to Belle Isle. 
She is aware that there are a num-
ber of tough issues in her district. 
Chang highlighted quality of edu-
cation, safety in Detroit, criminal 
justice and environmental issues 
as persistent challenges.

“There are a number of areas 

in Southwest Detroit that have 
high amounts of corporate pollu-
tion that are very concerning, and 
could have a huge public health 
impact,” she said.

Chang stressed the impor-

tance of developing the district’s 
relationship with the Detroit 
City Council to help ease these 
problems. Additionally, Chang 
has established a neighborhood 
service center where residents 
can easily seek assistance in their 
district.

“One of the things I have is a 

neighborhood service center in 
the district, so that people don’t 
necessarily just have to call my 
Lansing office,” Chang said. “They 
can actually come in to our Detroit 
office right in the district.”

Chang’s 
parents 
emigrated 

from Taiwan to pursue edu-
cational opportunities in the 
United States. In part due to her 
background, Chang’s campaign 

advocated for increased quality of 
education in Detroit. Chang and a 
group of state legislators toured 
Detroit Public Schools Friday to 
meet principals, students and 
parents to get a sense of the most 
pressing issues facing the public 
school system.

That morning, the Detroit 

Free Press reported that every 
senior at Cristo Rey High School, 
a Catholic school in Southwest 
Detroit in District 6, was accept-
ed into college.

“We want to celebrate the suc-

cess that that school has had,” 
she said. “We have some really 
amazing schools to be proud of in 
Detroit.”

Though 
Chang 
plans 
to 

advocate for improvements to 
education, she opposes the emer-
gency financial manager law, 
which allowed Republican Gov. 
Rick Snyder to appoint a new 
emergency manager for Detroit’s 
public school system last week.

“Emergency 
management 

hasn’t necessarily provided the 
solutions that we need,” Chang 
said. “No one knows better what 
needs to happen than those that 
are directly impacted by DPS.”

of 3 will subjected to intensive pri-
mary therapy.”

The Ann Arbor scoring system 

will help ensure patients at lower 
risk are subjected to less aggres-
sive treatments than patients at 
higher risk. Patients will then 
gain individualized treatments 
based on their needs.

More than half of the patients 

undergoing bone marrow trans-
plantation 
develop 
GVHD. 

Though the degree of severity 
differs in patients, the disease is 
highly lethal if not treated imme-
diately.

The research began in the late 

1990s when investigators ana-
lyzed blood samples from 500 
GVHD patients. The results were 
verified when another 300 patient 
blood samples from across the 
United States were analyzed.

The next step, according to 

Levine, is the launch of a clini-
cal trial. The U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration has approved this 
step.

“It is still research,” Levine 

said. “Although the paper has 
been published, we are still at the 
investigational phase. No market-
ing is being done yet.”

speech. “I hope to leave people 
talking.”

Coates, whose background is 

primarily rooted in historical 
studies and journalism, not activ-
ism, focused his lecture on facts 
and data to make a case for repa-
rations.

According to Coates, the his-

tory of African Americans is 
rooted in exploitation. He said 
slavery was responsible for fos-
tering institutionalized racism in 
America because it legalized the 
use of Black labor for economic 
profit, criminalized Blacks who 
tried to learn to write and barred 
them from voting, effectively pre-
venting them from participating 
in society.

“The fundamental feature of 

slavery, of enslavement, of all the 
great physical violence it took to 
maintain the system is the fact 
that attribution is plundering,” 
he said. “It’s important to under-
stand the plunder wasn’t a side 
product; it wasn’t incidental.”

For example, Coates said dur-

ing the 18th and 19th centuries, 
slave-picked cotton accounted for 
the majority of American exports 
and the country’s richest region 
was in the South, where cotton 
plantations thrived.

Even after slavery was abol-

ished with the 1863 Emancipation 
Proclamation, Coates said African 
Americans were still oppressed by 
a sharecropping system designed 
to reduplicate slavery within the 
confines of the 13th Amendment, 
which outlawed the institution. 
Sharecropping refers to the sys-
tem in which newly freed slaves 
worked someone else’s land in 
exchange for some of the crops 
produced. Because former slaves 
lacked resources and land to 
begin their life post-slavery, the 
system exploited Black citizens in 
a form similar to slavery.

“We live in a country that, for 

at least 350 years, the policy was 
to ensure black failure,” Coates 
said in a seminar for students 
before the speech. “And it was 
largely successful.”

Transitioning to the present 

day, Coates described the ways 
in which housing discrimina-
tion barred Black families from 
living in certain areas, thus 
inhibiting their access to good 
schools. Though paying taxes 
to the government, Coates said 
Black people contributed money 
to a government that barred them 
from many public institutions like 
quality schools.

“Ultimately, the case for rep-

arations boils down to a very 
simple concept,” he said. “If we 
know that the African American 
community in this country for the 
lion’s share of its history has been 
subject to plunder at every level of 
our society … then perhaps some 
small amount, some significant 
amount of what was taken from 
you should be given back.”

Following his lecture, Coates 

held a question-and-answer ses-
sion with the crowd, responding 
to a host of questions primarily 
examining modern day racism. 
Coates also hosted a smaller sem-
inar for around 30 undergraduate 
and graduate students before the 
speech.

During the Q&A session, asked 

Coates about his thoughts on 
multiple issues, including gentri-
fication in Detroit, and the fight to 
reduce drug-related incidents in 
the United States.

Coates said gentrification is an 

after-effect of the years of hous-
ing discrimination, when spe-
cific states and private companies 
made it legal for certain neighbor-
hoods to receive unequal public 
benefits based on the demograph-
ics of their residents.

“Detroit’s population has been 

declining for a long time,” he said. 
“The question to ask is, ‘Why is 
this happening to begin with?’ ”

During the smaller seminar, 

Coates spoke more personally, 

discussing his journey to become 
a journalist and writer, as well as 
the confluences between writing 
and activism.

Rackham 
students 
Austin 

McCoy, Hakeem Jefferson and 
Courtney McCluney moderated 
the discussion. The students said 
they hoped to learn how Coates 
uses 
scholarship 
on 
African 

American history and American 
society as a journalist.

“I’m just really excited to know 

that there’s someone who cares 
about the work that we’re doing, 
and wants to spread it broadly 
and make arguments using our 
work,” McCluney said.

Coates told the group he had 

an unorthodox upbringing and 
childhood compared to other 
journalists 
and 
authors. 
His 

father, a Black Panther during the 
1970s and 1980s, taught Coates 
to revere Malcolm X as the lead-
ing African American civil rights 
hero, not Martin Luther King Jr., 
as the majority of Americans did.

Though he read and wrote 

throughout his childhood, Coates 
said his performance in school 
was “abysmal.” After studying 
history at Howard University for 
a few years, where he wrote for 
the school paper, he dropped out 
to pursue a career in journalism.

In both the seminar and in an 

interview with the Daily, Coates 
said the future for equality for 
African Americans will not be 
attained until the agenda of 
those in power or a critical mass 
of people aligns with the agenda 
of social activists. However, he 
added that individuals actively 
opposing racism also have a role 
to play.

“What they’re doing is not 

insignificant,” he said. “What 
they’re doing is exactly what they 
should be doing. You make the 
argument, you make the argu-
ment, you make the argument, 
and when the sky opens up you 
take your chance. But it’s just not 
open right now.”

Let’s get this Q&A started!
Q: What is Q&A?
A: Q&A, shorthand for Queer 

in Action, is The Michigan 
Daily’s first section devoted 
exclusively to members of the 
LGBTQ community. This inde-
pendent section is a space for 
those at the University associ-
ating with a queer identity to 
share their stories and experi-
ences.

Q: Why is this section being 

created?

A: We believe that the narra-

tives, experiences and oppres-
sions faced in the LGBTQ 
community 
are 
frequently 

minimized and overshadowed 
by the heteronormative and cis-
normative standards. We want 
those with a queer identity to 
speak up and share their stories 
related to whatever shapes and 
exists from sexuality and gen-
der.

We 
want 
to 
emphasize 

that this space is intention-
ally designed to be safe for all 
contributors because we want 
you to feel comfortable shar-
ing your stories. Topics sur-
rounding sexuality, gender and 
homophobia 
can 
sometimes 

be uncomfortable to discuss in 
daily life, but we encourage you 
to overcome those fears in this 
space. We want you to be hon-
est, confident and candid about 
the thoughts in your mind and 
experiences on your heart.

Q: Why is this section called 

Q&A?

A: Q&A serves as a relevant 

acronym for this space because 
a queer person’s sexuality can 
require a variety of answers to 
multiple questions. Our culture 
structures sexuality by creat-
ing strict categories like gay, 
lesbian and bisexual. For some, 
sexuality (and gender) is much 
more complicated than check-
ing off one of these boxes. So 
in these articles, besides shar-
ing personal stories, we hope 
that this space serves to spot-
light and answer questions sur-
rounding the nuances of each 
person’s sexuality (or gender). 
Possible questions include but 
are not limited to:

- What sexual category do I 

closest identify with?

- What similarities and dif-

ferences exist between myself 
and the stigmas associated with 
my sexual or non-cisgender 
identity?

- How do my gender and sex-

uality interact in forming who I 
am as a person?

- What specific experiences 

or oppressions come from my 
queer identity?

We hope that, in addition to 

recanting stories and reveal-
ing oppression, this space will 
serve as a vessel to spark con-
versations 
and 
discussions 

regarding sexuality and gender.

Q: You’ve used the words 

“queer,” 
“heteronormative” 

and “cisgender,” and I don’t 
understand at least one of those 
terms. Am I going to be able to 
understand content from this 
section?

A: Good question! First, not 

all articles will use this complex 
language, but we’ve prepared 
materials to help you if you’re 
confused. We’ve created an 
online catalogue of important 
terms, the “LGBT A-Z Diction-
ary,” found on The Michigan 
Daily website. We hope this 
helps everyone feel competent 
in understanding our content, 
regardless of your prior knowl-
edge on these topics. Besides 
straightforward definitions, we 
provide as much relevant infor-
mation about each term, and 
we’ll continue updating the dic-
tionary as necessary. We hope 
you refer back to this catalogue 
as much as you need.

Q: Can I write for Q&A?
A: That depends. If you iden-

tify as gay, bisexual, lesbian, 
transgender, asexual, pansex-
ual or demisexual, then you 
definitely can. If you claim your 
identity as queer, most likely 
you can and you should e-mail 
us if you’re concerned.

If you identify as hetero-

sexual and cisgender, then you 
cannot contribute. While we 
love ally support, this space is 
designed for only queer-identi-
fying people to contribute con-
tent. The best way for allies to 
contribute is to read articles, 
share ones you love and spread 
awareness for this space. That 
alone serves as a contribution 
to this section.

Q: What can I write for Q&A?
A: Whatever is related to 

your personal story. We at 
Q&A don’t want to constrict 
what your contributions can 
be, much like we don’t want to 
place strict categories on what 
your sexuality might be. All we 
ask is that you include your per-
sonal experiences, be as candid 
as possible and develop some 
overarching theme or idea in 
your piece. Please e-mail us 
with your ideas for a story, and 
we’ll work with you from there.

Q: Can I contribute on a more 

frequent basis?

A: Yes! Absolutely! We’re 

looking to hire consistent con-
tributors, and it will come 
with some perks. If interested, 
e-mail us and we’ll send you 
an application and answer any 
questions that you might have.

Now, without further ado, I’d 

like you all to meet the found-
ing editors for Queer in Action:

I’m Michael Schramm, a col-

umnist for The Michigan Daily. 
I’ll be leading this section as the 
first Q&A editor. As a gay man, 
I believe this space is so crucial 
for queer members, as there 

aren’t many available spaces for 
us to share our stories and nar-
ratives. I’m looking forward to 
the dialogues, empowerment 
and catharsis that this space 
will provide.

I’m Ryan Freeland, a junior 

studying in International Stud-
ies, focusing on global health. I 
identify as pansexual. I’m inter-
ested in being an editor for this 
blog because the queer com-
munity is still marginalized 
on campus. I feel this blog will 
allow for stories to be heard and 
create a new kind of movement 
on campus.

I’m Lita Brillman, a sopho-

more studying women’s studies, 
a feminist and longtime bisexu-
al. I’m stoked to do my part in 
elevating marginalized voices 
on campus, and look forward 
to reading and connecting with 
stories of other queer Wolver-
ines. I hope that we can all work 
to make this an inclusive space 
to all identities that may inter-
sect with queerness, and repre-
sent a broad perspective of the 
Michigan queer community.

I’m Kastriot Osmani, an 

international 
freshman. 
I’m 

from Kosova (a country in 
Europe), and I am interested 
in making this a space where 
people feel comfortable shar-
ing their experiences and sto-
ries, without a fear of judgment 
or negativity. As someone who 
has lived in various countries, 
mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa, I 
have seen various forms of anti-
queer discrimination, and while 
the University has a much more 
accepting and liberal climate, I 
still feel that there’s a long way 
to go, and that this blog can be a 
catalyst for change. I’m looking 
forward to hearing all of your 
wonderful stories!

That’s all for our first Q&A. 

But before we go, we’d like 
to give a special shout-out to 
another Michigan Daily sec-
tion: Michigan in Color. MiC, 
thanks for being the first sec-
tion to create a place for a mar-
ginalized group. Your space’s 
success has undoubtedly aided 
our space’s creation, and for 
that, we are sincerely thankful. 
We look forward to seeing your 
section continue this semester, 
and we hope that you’ll take a 
peek at some of our content as 
well.

Now, it’s time for your Q&A 

(but don’t feel the need to fol-
low this question and answer 
format). It’s time for the world 
to hear your stories and experi-
ences with sexuality and gen-
der.

Those interested in contrib-

uting content to Queer in Action 
can contact the editors at queer-

N

o, it’s not about the NFL 
playoffs. It’s about the 
one other, non-flu patho-

gen 
infecting 

college campus-
es across the 
nation: 
sexual 

assault. 
Since 

the beginning of 
the school year, 
sexual assaults 
on campus have 
received ample 
attention, 
par-

ticularly at plac-
es like Columbia 
University and 
the 
University 

of Virginia. Emma Sulkowicz, a 
senior 
at 
Columbia 
(colloqui-

ally known as “mattress girl”), has 
served as the face for these issues 
through her performance piece 
Carry That Weight.

This has been a complicated 

time for me as a spectator, given 
that I have known Emma since 
kindergarten. Emma was, in my 
experience, hardly a shy or dainty 
girl. During the day, she was smart 
beyond belief, funny and easy to 
talk to. At night, Emma was just as 
bravely forward with some of my 
friends as she was with the telling 
of her story to the country. She was 
never a pushover. So, in the midst 
of all of her publicity (largely in 
September), I never doubted she 
was telling the truth. But I did 
wonder one thing: how could this 
happen to her, of all people?

Confusion seems to be a hall-

mark of many sexual assault 
cases. Confusion is present before, 
during and after the act. Confu-
sion seems to be a consequence of 
an initial incongruence between 
the two sides that led to what 
could even be interpreted as non-
consensual sex. In my experience, 
consensual sex is tremendously 
unconfusing — there aren’t really 
that many confounding factors 
when you are taking each other’s 
clothes off. So the very concept 
of rape resonates with confusion, 
typically about far more than 
“what happened in the room.”

In the effort to alleviate some 

of this confusion, scientists have 
conducted studies to try to analyze 
sexual assault with probabilities 
and quantifications. For example, 
19 percent of female students in 
college experienced completed or 
attempted sexual assault during 
their time on campus. Similarly, 
female students who experienced 

sexual assault prior to college were 
eight times more likely to experi-
ence it again during college. Fur-
thermore, female students who 
have “reported getting drunk since 
entering college” are 1.7 times more 
likely to be the victims of sexual 
assault, with fraternity men being 
the most likely perpetrators.

But what do these numbers 

really mean, or rather, what are we 
to make of them? Don’t spend time 
drinking at fraternities? Don’t go to 
college in the first place?

These are coarse interpreta-

tions of an extraordinarily sensi-
tive question. Sexual assault is not 
a “disease” itself; it cannot be van-
quished with comparative effec-
tiveness studies and rehabilitation 
regimens. It is, rather, a symptom 
of a much larger malignancy.

On Tuesday morning, The New 

York Times sought to address this 
broader malignancy in an article 
titled “Sorority Anti-Rape Idea: 
Drinking on Own Turf.” Amidst 
a comprehensive profiling of 
recent sexual assault cases, the 
author, Alan Schwarz, explores 
a suggestion to have drinking 
occur in the sorority houses 
themselves. 
Female 
students 

interviewed detailed the role 
of a “home-court advantage” at 
Greek parties, the importance of 
“ownership of the social scene,” 
analogizing host fraternities to 
“hunting grounds.” Thus, the 
suggestion to have sororities 
 

host parties.

However, from where I sit, 

this suggestion would only intro-
duce more issues. The benefit to 
being a visitor (in the Greek con-
text, but also more broadly) is 
that, if uncomfortable, you can 
leave. Though there are dangers 
off-campus late at night, reliable 
taxi and bus service, coupled with 
walking in a group, mitigate these 
issues. There is much power in 
the ability to leave on a moment’s 
notice. On the contrary, opening 
your own house up to others makes 
this “escape plan” far more compli-
cated. A closed door in your own 
house is equally dangerous to that 
of another’s, with the caveat that 
you have nowhere else to go.

No. I think that the deeper 

issue to be explored here has to 
do with the male-female relation-
ships, interactions and expecta-
tions in the campus context. It’s 
less tangible than an address on a 
Facebook event.

I was recently asked by one of 

my friends when the last time I had 
“sober sex” was. He was surprised 
by my answer — he hadn’t done it 
since high school. Another friend 
asked what he should “do with” a 
girl he was interested in. I suggest-
ed he take her on a date. He laughed 
at me. A third friend shared his 
internal debate on whether or not 
to ask a girl to be “exclusive.” He 
resolved it was better not to.

I believe that these are the 

products of the larger relationship 
problem. 
Relationships 
are 

complex, convoluted and opaque. 
This, in my mind, is the malignancy.

To put it simply: I just don’t 

think guys and girls know each 
other well enough nor intimately 
enough. When you know someone 
intimately, you know whether 
they’re 
being 
blunt, 
versus 

sarcastic, versus sassy. When you 
know someone intimately, you 
know whether they’re squirming 
in discomfort, writhing in pain or 
just ticklish. When you do not, you 
don’t know how to tell someone 
you’re scared, uncomfortable and 
need to go home. When you do not, 
you don’t know how to read the 
signs, and you don’t know how to 
give them.

Mandating 
comprehensive 

sexual assault education for 
all entering college students, 
including 
the 
detailed 

narratives and experiences of 
survivors, 
would 
supplement 

this more intimate education. 
The current feeble attempts at 
sexual assault education lack 
the detail, strength and emotion 
of testimony. The combination 
would serve to make the signs 
more clear and to clarify some of 
the insidious confusion.

I am still confused about what 

happened to Emma. There are 
no clear answers, nor immediate 
solutions. But I do hope that 
she, as with other victims (male 
or female), can recover a sense 
of normality in time. And I 
do hope that he, as with other 
perpetrators (male or female), 
can get to know the objects of his 
desire better in the future. But, 
that way, they might become more 
than objects; they might become 
living, breathing, feeling partners. 
That way, when they say “yes,” 
explicitly or implicitly, he might 
be able to hear them.

Or too, when they say “no.”

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

The 42nd anniversary of Roe 

v. Wade marks a bittersweet 
time of reflection for us as abor-
tion rights activists.

Although Roe v. Wade is 

widely celebrated as a ground-
breaking United States Supreme 
Court decision, it set a surpris-
ingly weak precedent for abortion 
rights. In 1970, Jane Roe sued the 
district attorney of Dallas based 
on the premise that her inability 
to receive a legal abortion in the 
state of Texas violated her person-
al liberty. She claimed that this 
liberty was embodied in the due 
process clause of the 14th Amend-
ment, and that the “penumbras” 
of the Bill of Rights recognized, 
to some extent, a right to sexual 
and reproductive privacy. The 
Supreme Court did not uphold 
this logic.

Instead, former Justice Harry 

Blackmun’s 
majority 
opinion 

ruled that before fetal viability, 
“the abortion decision … must 
be left to the medical judgment 
of the pregnant woman’s attend-
ing physician.” (“Viability” is 
the stage in pregnancy where a 
fetus is capable of surviving out-
side of the womb, usually 24 to 
28 weeks, or in the Court’s lan-
guage, the end of the second tri-
mester.) This ruling was based 
on the Court’s interpretation of 
the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth 
and 14th Amendments, as well as 
precedents set in previous cases 
such as Griswold v. Connecti-
cut that, together, established a 
right to privacy. However, after 
fetal viability, weighing a “com-

pelling” interest in fetal life 
against the right to privacy is a 
decision left to individual states.

What are the problems here? 

To start, the focus on the right 
to privacy allowed the Court to 
construct a rationale that rec-
ognized the legality of first and 
second-trimester abortions but 
failed to provide for accessibil-
ity. Before Roe v. Wade, those 
who could afford to travel to 
one of the 17 states where abor-
tion laws were liberalized and 
those who could achieve consent 
from a physician to receive abor-
tions due to health concerns (the 
majority of whom were wealthy, 
white women) already had access 
to abortion. Thus, the Roe v. 
Wade decision did not sufficient-
ly address the underlying issues 
of socioeconomic status (often 
stratified along racial lines) in 
abortion access because it hardly 
addressed the issues of accessi-
bility and affordability.

The fact that the Supreme 

Court justified a woman’s right 
to limited bodily autonomy with 
a judicially created right to pri-
vacy and the right of physicians 
to practice medicine freely bar-
ring a compelling state interest — 
instead of following Roe’s initial 
argument that women possess a 
fundamental liberty in choosing 
whether to carry a pregnancy to 
term — is additionally problem-
atic. If the Court had focused on 
recognizing the humanity and 
basic freedom of women, rather 
than the constitutional politics 
of privacy in healthcare, abortion 

rights in the United States might 
be much stronger today.

Instead, abortion rights have 

been under attack for decades. 
Roe v. Wade set a weak prec-
edent, but it is the only national 
precedent that we have, and even 
this fragile foundation is being 
chipped away by today’s legisla-
tures at both state and national 
levels. New bills are passed every 
year that place restrictions on 
abortion clinics and decrease 
funding opportunities, further 
reducing accessibility. For exam-
ple, last year in Michigan, a law 
was passed that requires individ-
uals who may become pregnant to 
buy an insurance rider specifical-
ly for abortion, effectively forcing 
planning for an unplanned preg-
nancy. In addition, the U.S. House 
of Representatives is debating 
legislation right now to ban abor-
tion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, 
and to set nationally mandated 
abortion clinic restrictions that 
would place costly constraints 
on abortion providers, essentially 
reversing the basic premise of Roe 
v. Wade.

Forty-two years after Roe 

v. Wade, many people remain 
unable to secure safe, legal abor-
tions due to economic constraints 
not accounted for in the decision. 
In effect, abortion is rendered a 
privilege, not a right. It is clear 
that the work of activists in repro-
ductive freedom is as important 
now as ever.

LSA sophomore. 

CLAIRE TAIGMAN | VIEWPOINT

Reflecting on Roe v. Wade

S

ince the film’s release last 
week, Clint Eastwood’s 
“American Sniper” has 

been the con-
sistent 
topic 

of 
debate 

amongst 
Hol-

lywood 
chat-

ter throughout 
online 
plat-

forms. “Ameri-
can 
Sniper” 

chronicles 
the adulthood 
of U.S. Navy 
SEAL 
Chris 

Kyle, 
played 

by 
Bradley 

Cooper, as he became known as 
one of the most lethal snipers in 
American history throughout 
his four combat tours in Iraq. 
Directed by Clint Eastwood, the 
film was based on Kyle’s best-
selling 2012 autobiography of the 
same name.

Although the movie ranked 

No. 1 this past weekend, gross-
ing more than $105 million at the 
box office and setting an open-
ing weekend record as the top-
grossing Oscar nominee ever, 
appreciation and praise of the 
film has not been unanimous.

Film director Michael Moore, 

who famously criticized the Iraq 
War in his 2003 Oscar accep-
tance speech, is now expressing 
his views via Twitter, calling 
snipers “cowards.” On Janu-
ary 18, Moore tweeted, “My 
uncle killed by sniper in WW2. 
We were taught snipers were 
cowards. Will shoot u in the 
back. Snipers aren’t heroes. And 
invaders r worse.” A few hours 
later he followed up, tweeting, 
“But if you’re on the roof of your 
home defending it from invaders 
who’ve come 7K miles, you are 
not a sniper, u are brave, u are 
 

a neighbor.”

Seth Rogan, the director of 

the recent cinematic contro-
versy “The Interview,” also 
tweeted that the film reminded 
him of the faux-Nazi propagan-
da film that Quentin Tarantino 
featured in his film “Inglouri-
ous Basterds,” in which a Ger-
man sniper talks about how he 
picked off 200 Allied soldiers 

from a clock tower. He later 
amended his opinion, writing, 
“I just said something ‘kinda 
reminded’ me of something else. 
I actually liked ‘American Snip-
er.’ It just reminded me of the 
 

Tarantino scene.”

More 
recently, 
journalist 

Karen Zacharias wrote an edi-
torial for CNN titled, “Why I 
refuse to see ‘American Sniper,’ 
” expressing concern that the 
film may be glorifying or mis-
representing war. She claims, 
however, that her reluctance 
has nothing to do with Michael 
Moore’s flippant assertion that 
snipers are cowards, countering 
that she was always taught that 
cowards are those who refuse to 
serve their country.

Zacharias writes, “When my 

father died there were no crowds 
gathered at Cowboys Stadium, 
no JumboTron displaying pic-
tures of the family man my 
father was, and no front-page 
stories. There was just a broken 
family feeling very abandoned by 
an ungrateful nation.” She con-
cludes, “Hollywood has a way of 
fictionalizing war, of making it 
all about ‘us’ and ‘them’… I have 
traveled to my father’s battlefield 
in Vietnam and I have befriend-
ed Vietnamese who lost even 
more than I did during the war. I 
have learned there is no ‘us’ and 
‘them.’ There is only ‘us.’ ”

While I respect Zacharias’ 

personal reasons for abstain-
ing from viewing the film, I felt 
as though the arguments she 
cites in her piece are not entirely 
applicable to “American Sniper.” 
Chris Kyle had no intention or 
expectation of a crowd gather-
ing at Cowboys Stadium in his 
honor or a 200-mile procession 
— and that is exactly the point. 
Rather, “American Sniper” tells 
the crucial, very real story of a 
man grappling with his role in 
the Iraqi war.

In fact, when asked by Time 

magazine’s Belinda Luscombe 
why he originally wrote the 
novel, Kyle explained that he 
wanted to write about “not the 
sacrifices that the military mem-
bers make, but the sacrifices 
that their families have to go 

through, about the single moth-
ers now raising their children … 
then also stories about my guys 
that deserve to be out there. They 
didn’t get the Medal of Honor 
so you don’t know about them, 
but they died heroes and people 
should know about them.” Both 
in his live interviews and as por-
trayed by Bradley Cooper in the 
film, Chris Kyle honorably emu-
lates humility, dedication and 
a life and heart of service — an 
inspiring, humanistic example of 
conduct that is able to resonate 
with the majority of the feature’s 
audience.

I was personally both enter-

tained 
and 
enlightened 
by 

“American Sniper,” leaving the 
theater wanting to communicate 
the importance of Chris Kyle, 
his story and the film. What I 
appreciated the most about the 
film was its alarming ability to 
be apolitical. The piece makes no 
statement about the folly of war, 
nor does it glamorize or glorify 
it. “American Sniper” is simply 
Kyle’s story, from the moment 
he decides to enlist to when he 
returns home permanently. It 
does not attempt to suggest what 
should have been done overseas 
or what was being done over-
seas; it solely presents the real-
ity of the war for a single soldier 
and from his point of view.

Ultimately, “American Sniper” 

is truly a great American war 
story, and what I believe may 
quickly become a classic. The 
power of the film comes not from 
its underlying commentary — and 
I am irritated that critics may be 
attempting to fabricate some — 
but instead from its simplicity 
and focus. The strength of Chris 
Kyle’s tale lies in its resonant por-
trayal of a man struggling with 
his responsibilities to his God, 
his country and his young fam-
ily, and how those contrasting 
responsibilities riddle him with 
internal tensions. It is not neces-
sarily a story about snipers, vio-
lence or war, but one about how 
we may fare when faced with such 
 

imminent pressures.

I

t’s a simple drive to get to 
the airport. Head down 
State Street, take I-94 East 

to 
exit 
198 

and follow the 
signs. 
Many 

Michigan stu-
dents 
with 

cars on cam-
pus are used 
to the drive, 
picking up and 
dropping 
off 

friends 
visit-

ing from home 
or recent grad-
uates return-
ing for a visit.

I found myself making this 

trip again last week for the lat-
ter reason. Maybe because it 
was dark and calm on the free-
way, or maybe because it’s my 
senior year, hence everything 
is sentimental, but I found 
myself thinking about the trip as 
more than just a quick drive to 
 

the airport.

“Experienced 
driver” 
isn’t 

something I would be comfort-
able putting on my resume; I 
would rather be in the passen-
ger seat — navigating via Google 
Maps — than sitting behind the 
wheel. In fact, I am pretty sure I 
drove about 10 percent of the rec-
ommended 50 hours of driving I 
was supposed to complete before 
my driver’s test. I passed the test 
just days before my senior year 
began because my brother was 
leaving for college, forcing me 
to find an alternate way to get 
 

to school.

My arsenal of excuses I use to 

avoid driving range from frugal-
ity (I’d rather spend money on 
clothes than on gas) to forgetful-
ness (occasionally I will “forget” 
to bring my glasses to the car). If 
I am being honest, I even claim 
my 5-foot-tall frame is simply 
too short to see above the wheel 
of some cars (I’m looking at you, 
Honda Prius).

But on this particular eve-

ning, I thought about freshman 

year, when I anxiously headed 
to the airport to pick up my 
high-school boyfriend. Google 
Maps was cued up on my cell 
phone and laptop, and I forced 
my brother to tell me the direc-
tions over and over until I knew 
them better than the answers to 
my Econ 101 exam. I sat in the 
car, took a deep breath, checked 
my mirrors twice and headed 
toward the freeway.

Even though I knew the exit 

I was supposed to take to get to 
the airport, I still panicked as I 
passed the sign for Willow Run 
Airport. Was this where I was 
supposed to turn off? Had it been 
20 miles already? How could 
there be two airports in such a 
small stretch of road? Without 
Siri’s soothing voice telling me 
to continue on I-94 East, I may 
not have made it that day.

Last week, though, I passed 

the sign for Willow Run Airport 
and laughed to myself, thinking 
of the stress this silly sign had 
caused me my freshman year. 
Why had my anxiety about driv-
ing to the airport dissipated? It 
was still the same sign, the same 
car and the same drive. The cir-
cumstances hadn’t changed — I 
had changed.

Some argue college is a time 

to get out of your comfort zone, 
but I think college expanded 
my comfort zone. I came here 
as little more than a high school 
student who had just gotten her 
license the year before. I went to 
school in state, following in my 
father and brother’s footsteps 
at the University of Michigan. 
I arrived on campus thinking I 
could learn a lot from my new 
environment, but acknowledg-
ing Ann Arbor was definitely 
well within my comfort zone.

But then things changed. I 

made new friends who came 
from backgrounds I had never 
encountered in my northern 
Michigan hometown. I learned 
from professors who held views 
on issues I hadn’t even consid-

ered because they just hadn’t 
occurred to me. I spent a semes-
ter in Washington, D.C., a city 
more than 100 times the size of 
the place where I grew up. And 
somewhere in that timeframe, 
I learned to drive to the airport 
without getting nervous.

In four months I’ll be moving 

to Washington, D.C., a city filled 
with a metro system, reliable 
buses, a steady stream of taxis 
and a climate that makes walk-
ing a real possibility for most of 
the year. Realistically, I won’t 
own a car for at least five years. 
But there are other things to be 
stressed about as I transition 
from the “bubble” of college to 
the “real world.”

I’ll find a job and learn to 

budget wisely in a city like D.C. 
while on a public service salary. 
I’ll apartment hunt with some-
one I don’t know and be nervous 
about whether or not they’ll 
leave their dishes in the sink. I’ll 
balance work life with activi-
ties I love, like running, reading 
and visiting new restaurants. 
And I’ll negotiate leaving my 
college friendships, events and 
experiences that have so won-
derfully tugged at the outline of 
my comfort zone until I couldn’t 
see many of the boundaries I set 
for myself in high school. I have 
faith, though, that within a few 
years these things will be mind-
less tasks—daily operations not 
even worth much thought. Post-
graduate life will push against 
the outline of my comfort zone 
yet again.

While I still might hesitate to 

sign myself up for a cross-country 
road trip, I can confidently drive 
myself from Ann Arbor to wher-
ever I need to go. And while I 
might not be excited to leave my 
college days behind this spring, 
I know heading to the next big 
thing is within my comfort zone, 
thanks to my time in Ann Arbor.

It’s mystic, it’s magical 

and it will be reality for the 
Muggle world this weekend.

Saturday evening, in the 

Rogel Ballroom of the Michi-
gan Union, the University 
Quidditch team will host its 
third annual Yule Ball, a dance 
event open to all students.

The Yule Ball, inspired 

by J.K. Rowling’s Harry Pot-
ter series, has drawn hun-
dreds of stu-
dents 
each 

year since its 
i n c e p t i o n , 
even 
sell-

ing out in its 
2013 
debut. 

It’s 
the 

team’s 
larg-

est fundraiser 
of the year, 
with the proceeds support-
ing their quest to attend 
this year’s World Cup in 
Rock Hill, South Carolina.

The dance also allows 

the Quidditch team to reach 
out to the student body.

“This is an important even 

for our team because it is our 
chance to connect with the 
University community and 
show them what our team is 
about,” said LSA senior and 
University Quidditch Presi-

dent Margaret Burns. “We 
normally do not have many 
home games for students to 
watch, and we practice off 
campus, so we do not always 
get to interact with students 
as much as we would like to.”

Tickets will be on sale 

from 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 
p.m. at the door, or stu-
dents can purchase pre-sale 
tickets through the Michi-
gan Union Ticket Office, 
both in person or online.

The ball will include per-

formances 
from the G-
Men, an all-
male a cap-
pella group, 
as well as 
the 
Friars, 

a subgroup 
of the Men’s 
Glee 
Club.

Q u i d -

ditch team players will also 
be performing. Two players 
may perform a Harry Pot-
ter-themed rap and another 
team member will show-
case magic tricks through-
out the show. Students can 
also get their fortune told 
by two tarot card readers.

“We as a team are huge 

fans of the Friars and G-Men,” 
Burns said. “And we also 
want to showcase some of the 
cool talents our team has.”

Daily Weekend Contributor

As the end of January 

quickly approaches, make 
sure to take advantage of 
the test- and essay-free 
weeks you have left by do-
ing some fun and differ-
ent things this weekend.

Friday, Jan. 23

 
This Friday, head down 

to Main Street to enjoy the 
last day of Restaurant Week. 
There are more than 50 res-
taurants 
featuring 
amaz-

ing deals, so I’m confident 
you will find something 

you will love. (I recom-
mend Palio or Vinology). 

It’s your last chance 

to take advantage of this 
awesome opportunity, be-
cause the next Restaurant 
Week won’t be until June!

Saturday, Jan. 24
 
Saturday 
night, 
the 

Michigan 
men’s 
basket-

ball team will be facing 
off 
against 
Wisconsin. 

It’s sure to be a fun game, 

but if you need any more 
convincing, 
the 
Crisler 

Center will also be home to 
this week’s ESPN College 
GameDay. Here’s to hoping 
we get as lucky as last week.

Sunday, Jan. 25

While the Oscars are 

still a few weeks away, get 
a head start on seeing some 
of this year’s Best Picture 
nominations. Both the State 
Theatre and the Michi-
gan Theater are featur-
ing screenings of “Selma,” 
“The Imitation Game” and 
“Whiplash.” Don’t forget to 
indulge in some popcorn 
while enjoying the show!is 
still ongoing. There have 
been various theories and 
conjectures as to what 
happened to the flight 
but there are still very 
little facts available re-
garding 
the 
situation. 

3 THINGS to do this weekend

Behind Enemy Lines: 
Iowa’s Samantha Logic

Michigan plays 
another ranked 
team on road 

Thursday at Iowa

By MINH DOAN 

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team is heating up.

After an exciting comeback 

victory 
over Ohio 
State 
in 

overtime 
10 
days 

ago, 
the 

Wolverines 
(4-2 
Big 

Ten, 
12-5 

overall) followed it up with 
another comeback thriller over 
Northwestern in Evanston on 
Saturday.

Though freshman forward 

Katelynn Flaherty — Michigan’s 
leading scorer — had just five 
points in the game, sophomore 
guard Siera Thompson picked 
up the slack, scoring 20 points, 
including five 3-pointers.

But to catch fire in the tough 

Big Ten, Michigan will have to 
travel to Iowa City on Thursday 
night and defeat No. 20 Iowa 
(5-1, 14-3).

Iowa is on a streak of its own, 

though, having toppled Purdue, 
Northwestern and Michigan 
State in its last three games.

The Hawkeyes are led by 

a duo of guards in Melissa 
Dixon and Samantha Logic, 
who lead the squad with 15.8 
points and 6.8 assists per game, 
respectively. Logic’s 6.8 assists 
per game are good for No. 10 in 
the nation.

The Daily sat down with 

Logic in October at Big Ten 
Media 
Day 
to 
talk 
about 

the upcoming season, going 
professional and her odd choice 
of sports in high school.

The Michigan Daily: Last 

year, you were a unanimous All-
Big Ten first team pick — where 
do you go from there?

Samantha Logic: I think 

moreso, my mindset is not so 
much about me individually, 
but more about my team. We 
want to get better every single 
day and compete for a Big Ten 
championship. We got to the 
title game last year, and we 
want to be there again and 
put ourselves in a position to 
be there consistently. And not 
just being in the title game, 
we would like to win one. We 
kind of just focus on the day-
to-day things. The (All-Big 
Ten first team pick is) nice to 
look back on later, but right 
now that’s not really the main 
focus. Obviously, it is nice to 
be recognized and know that 
people think you are at the 
top level, but I think your own 
expectations have to exceed 
what other people think you 
can do.

TMD: 

You’re known 
as a passing 
player, 
and 

your 
coach 

has said you 
improve 
the 
play 
of 

everyone 
around 
you. 

Would you say 
that’s true?

SL: It’s just one of those 

things that when everyone is 
involved and getting equal shots 
and the team doesn’t hinge on 
just one player, it’s just more 
fun. You can lean on each other, 
and we believe in each other so 
much, and I think that’s where 
it comes from. I believe in my 
teammates so much, and they 
believe in me so much, that it’s 
so fun to play together in that 
situation.

TMD: 
What 
are 
your 

expectations this year, for your 
team and for yourself?

SL: We want to be contending 

for a Big Ten championship. We 
want to get a ring so bad. For the 
four seniors, it’s our last chance 
to contend for that. We don’t 
know where we’re going after 
this, so this could be our last 
chance in a competitive setting 
like that at the highest level. 

TMD: Do you have plans to 

play after college?

SL: I would like to. First, 

I’d like to get drafted, that’d 
be awesome. If not, I can play 
overseas. I just love playing 
basketball so much, and it’s not 
something you can come back 
and do. You can’t take a couple 
years off and go back to playing 
basketball. So you push the 
real-world stuff to later and try 
to play as long as possible and 
make some kind of living off it 
and move on afterward.

TMD: In high school, you 

played softball, basketball and 
golf. Those sports are kind of 
on the opposite spectrums in 

sports — how 
did 
you 
get 

into each?

SL: They’re 

very random, 
that’s 
for 

sure. I’d never 
golfed before. 
I 
just 
had 

some 
friends 

that 
played, 

and I didn’t 
really want to 

play any other sport in the fall 
season. I also played soccer, 
but it was in the same season 
as softball, so I was kind of 
bummed about that. Golf, I 
picked up just because I wanted 
to mix it up with basketball. I 
think it’s good for you. People 
nowadays specialize so early 
on one sport, and I think your 
body needs a break, not even 
from sports, just from the same 
routine. And for softball, I 
flipped a coin before freshman 
year because I didn’t know 
which one I wanted to play.

‘M’ bigs face larger role

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

With 3:02 left in regulation, 

senior forward Max Bielfeldt 
snuck out to the 3-point line 
for an open shot. Junior guard 
Spike Albrecht found him, and 
the senior forward buried the 
shot that clinched the Michigan 
men’s basketball team’s win over 
Rutgers on Tuesday.

It 
was 
Bielfeldt’s 
most 

important shot of the season — 
and the Wolverines might need a 
few more like it as they navigate 
the final 11 games of the regular 
season without Caris LeVert.

LeVert was leading the team 

in 
points, 
rebounds, 
assists, 

steals and minutes. The 6-foot-6 
junior guard even led the team in 
blocks with seven, over Bielfeldt, 
freshman forward Ricky Doyle 
and redshirt freshman forward 
Mark Donnal.

After losing the frontcourt 

duo of Jordan Morgan and 
Jon Horford in the offseason, 
Michigan replaced them with 
Bielfeldt, Doyle and Donnal. 
With three scorers in LeVert and 
sophomores Derrick Walton Jr. 
and Zak Irvin elsewhere on the 
floor, the big men needed only to 
be serviceable for the first part of 
the season.

Together, the trio averaged 

16.1 points and 7.6 rebounds as 
the Wolverines started 6-1. With 
LeVert out for the season with 
a foot injury — and much of the 
rest of the team still nagged by 
injuries — they must grow up 
quickly.

“We’re definitely not new to 

adversity,” Bielfeldt said. “So 
when you have guys go down, 
guys sick, next man up.”

Bielfeldt 
took 
the 
reins 

Tuesday after Doyle sat down 
just 1:31 into the game, bothered 
by an illness. He finished with 
eight points and eight rebounds.

Meanwhile, the Wolverines 

didn’t get more than 12 points 
from any of their guards and shot 
just 35 percent from the floor and 
8-for-26 from 3-point range.

They now require a scoring 

presence from their big men, 
not just decent post defense or 
rebounding.

One of the nation’s worst teams 

in blocking shots, Michigan also 
finished with a season-high five 
blocks. Doyle managed three 
rejections in just seven minutes. 
Neither the big men nor the team 
in general were at their best, but 
they were able to get their first 
win without LeVert.

“I don’t know if anyone 

(among the team) looked at any 
game going forward and said 
(we could win on the road),” 
Beilein said Tuesday. “But now 
it gives credence that we can. It 
could be a blowout, but we have 
to stay together and play smart 
basketball.”

In the next four games, 

however, the Wolverines will 
face Wisconsin’s 7-foot Frank 
Kaminsky, Iowa’s 7-foot-1 Adam 
Woodbury and Nebraska’s 6-foot-
10 Walter Pitchford. And they’ll 
do it without LeVert available to 
neutralize a size disadvantage on 
the perimeter.

Beilein has proved he will play 

the hot hand, but getting hot 
in the next few weeks will be a 
challenge for any of the three big 
men. Each has the ability to break 
out — Donnal with 13 points 
against Southern Methodist on 
Dec. 20, and Bielfeldt with 18 

points against Bucknell on Nov. 
17.

But right now, the most likely 

candidate to pick up some of the 
scoring load is Doyle, who has six 
double-figure scoring games, if 
he can get healthy.

“He got a foul right away and 

did not play well in the first half,” 
Beilein said. “I told him, ‘You 
don’t look good, let me know 
right away in the second half if 
you don’t feel good.’ After three 
minutes he asked to come out. 
We have to get him through this 
and we’ll be better for it. But he is 
going through a health issue right 
now that we need to solve.”

Tuesday, Beilein also showed 

the tendency to play two big men 
at the same time. He hasn’t done 
so often this season, but with 
Donnal and Bielfeldt on the floor 
together for almost four minutes 
at the end of the first half, he 
shook things up — perhaps in part 
because they were two healthy 
bodies in a lineup severely 
lacking them.

At least for now, with more ill 

or injured players than healthy 
ones, that’s a key criterion. It 
will be up to the big men to 
shoulder some of the burden for 
production.

Ricky Doyle will need to produce for Michigan once his health improves.

Inside the nation’s top offense

By ZACH SHAW 

Daily Sports Writer

It’s easy to recognize that 

the Michigan hockey team can 
score goals. No team in the 
country scores as many as the 
16th-ranked Wolverines, at 4.15 
goals per game.

What’s harder to comprehend, 

however, is how Michigan is able 
to score so easily. Since scoring 
just 19 goals in their first seven 
games, the Wolverines have 
scored nearly five per game, 
including 39 in just six Big Ten 
games for a 6.5 average.

This outburst is a combination 

of strategy, chemistry, luck and 
talent, but is it a sustainable one? 
The Daily breaks down what 
has gone right as of late for the 
nation’s No. 1 offense to see just 
how long this hot streak can last.

Depth:

Above all else, this team 

was built to score goals. The 
Wolverines have six forwards 
already drafted to the NHL, and 
feature an impressive amount 
of depth that was on display in 
December.

“Any line on our team is a 

potential 
first 
line,” 
Hyman 

said after his team trumped 
the Buckeyes, 10-6, Friday. “We 
roll our lines out, and anyone 
can score. You can’t score 10 
goals with one line. That’s what 
happens when you have four lines 
that can score.”

The numbers back Hyman 

up. Michigan features seven of 
the conference’s top 15 point 
scorers, and even three of the top 
four scoring defensemen don the 
maize and blue.

Hyman, who is fourth in the 

nation in points, accounts for 
just 12.2 percent of Michigan’s 
point total. By comparison, 
freshman 
sensation 
and 

national scoring leader Jack 

Eichel constitutes 16.9 percent 
of his team’s offense.

Having others who are able 

to score throughout the lineup 
means that opposing defenses 
don’t get breaks when they play 
the Wolverines.

“(Dylan) Larkin’s line has had 

some chemistry right from the 
start that they have continued 
on, and JT (Compher)’s line also 
has chemistry, and the same goes 
for my line and Travis (Lynch’s),” 
Copp said after the Wolverines 
defeated the Buckeyes 8-3 Dec. 
5. “When we get all four lines 
producing on a nightly basis, the 
goals are going to come.”

Strategy:

It’s one thing to have the 

tools necessary to score. It’s 
another thing to use those tools 
effectively. The two main ways 
Michigan coach Red Berenson 
sees his team doing that are 
through the power-play and 
second-chance efforts.

“On your power play, you get 

your top offensive players out 

there,” he said. “If you can’t score 
with a man-advantage, then that 
doesn’t say much for what your 
team can do in the game.

“If you look at the good teams, 

they’re almost always near the 
top in the power play.”

In Michigan’s first 12 games, 

the Wolverines were far from the 
top, going just 5-for-46, or 10.8 
percent, on the man advantage. In 
the eight games since, however, 
Michigan has led the nation by 
scoring on 46.4 percent of power-
play opportunities.

In their win over Ohio State on 

Friday, the Wolverines scored five 
goals via the one-timer, and four 
on rebound goals. The movement 
on all lines can add up quickly.

Talent:

Depth and strategy help, but 

when it boils down to it, Michigan 
was built to score goals. With six 
NHL draft picks in the cohorts 
of forwards — including three 
centers — the Wolverines had the 
offensive firepower before the 
season began.

“I think when you look at most 

of my goals,” Larkin said Friday, 
“they’ve been good plays by 
other players and I’m just there 
to put it home. I think there’s 
some confidence, but a lot of it is 
because my linemates.”

Though 
it’s 
possible, 
it’s 

unlikely that Michigan will be 
able to score ten goals again this 
season. Berenson knows it’s an 
aberration, but he also knows that 
this is what his team is capable 
of. This is what the nation’s No. 1 
offense looks like.

“We’re 
probably 
getting 

a little puck luck,” Berenson 
said. “Shots are going in that in 
another game, a goalie might 
save. It might be the fact that 
all the players that are capable 
of producing on offense are 
producing, we’ve got a number 
of guys that can score, but for 
them to score like this all at the 
same time is unusual.

“You know how college hockey 

is, one night everything can be 
going in, and the next night it 
isn’t, so I don’t think there’s any 
one thing really.”

The Michigan hockey team has opened up a sizable margin as the nation’s highest-scoring team.

WRESTLING
Rossi Bruno works 
toward pinnacle

By BEN FIDELMAN

Daily Sports Writer

Rossi Bruno is accustomed to 

dominating.

The junior was the first 

wrestler ever to win five Florida 
state championships in a high-
school career, posting a 289-3 
record along the way. He was 
selected as a Fargo All-American 
four times, and InterMat had him 
as the 13th-best wrestler in his 
class.

By 
all 
accounts, 
Bruno 

succeeded at dominating his 
high school wrestling career. 
But through three seasons at 
Michigan, his record is far less 
illustrious.

There were definite bright 

spots 
during 
his 
freshman 

season at Michigan, but the 
year as a whole didn’t live up to 
his standards. Those successes 
included a seventh-place finish 
at the Big Ten Championships, 
which allowed for a 2-2 result 
at the NCAA tournament — two 
wins away from earning All-
American honors.

Bruno failed to stand out 

through much of the 2012-13 
season, posting a 16-18 record. 
In the end, outside of the season-
ending tournament success, it 
was a very unassuming campaign 
for an athlete who had been 
consistently unstoppable for the 
majority of his wrestling career.

Moving into his sophomore 

campaign, Bruno became more 
confident on the college level 
each weekend he competed. By 
midseason, Michigan had pushed 
its way into the top 10 teams in the 
nation, and Bruno was a massive 
contributor in the middle of the 
Wolverines’ lineup. He posted 
an overall record of 22-16 that 
season, finding a niche competing 

in tournament settings.

Although Bruno’s result at 

the 2014 Big Ten Championships 
was 
an 
underwhelming 
1-2, 

he had done enough to secure 
a spot wrestling at the NCAA 
Championships. 
Capitalizing 

on that opportunity, he made it 
to the Round of 12, falling one 
win short of achieving what he 
narrowly missed the year before: 
All-American honors.

“I like tournament setting 

because I can wrestle a little 
more conservative in my first 
match, and then get rolling,” 
Bruno said. “If I have a good first 
match, I’ll wrestle better against 
better kids later on.”

The pursuit of dominance 

and top finishes have continued 
into this season. Bruno has made 
some major mental adjustments, 
which have allowed him to 
compete with the aggressiveness 
and clarity he needs. Prompted 
by a suggestion from senior team 
captain Max Huntley, Bruno has 
learned to separate his goals for 
wrestling with those that will 
impact his life off the mats.

“I’ve only got two years left, so 

whether I accomplish my goals or 
not, there isn’t much that’s going 
to change in my real-world life,” 
Bruno said.

Backed with that mindset, 

Bruno is on a tear in the first leg of 
this 2014-15 season. He has shot 
off to a 14-5 record, including an 
11-3 mark in tournament play.

With one more full season 

of eligibility, combining both 
wrestling success and repurposed 
focus is opening channels for 
Bruno to stride into national 
championship contention. The 
pinnacle 
position 
in 
college 

wrestling is in his sights.

And he won’t stop until he’s 

there.

THE ART OF WORDS
Inside the University’s MFA fiction cohort

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

On the most blustery of days, I 

ventured deep into South Cam-
pus. Tucked beneath the loom-
ing shadow of the Big House was 
Wolverine Press. After wandering 
through a maze of office cubicles, 
I was immediately transported 
back into an early 20th-century 
factory workshop. Though the 
area was austere in nature, Fritz 
Swanson was quite the oppo-
site. A man with an orange beard 
that matched his neon T-shirt, he 
introduced me to the facility that 
houses the traditional letterpress 
print company that serves the 
Helen Zell Writers’ Program.

The Helen Zell Writers’ Pro-

gram is a top-ranked two-year 
Master of Fine Arts program in 
creative writing, with cohorts in 
fiction and poetry. In the program, 
students work on their respec-
tive creative writing pieces while 
also serving as Graduate Student 
Instructors. At the end of the 
program, they essentially have 
completed a full body of work, 
and they proceed to embark on a 
third-year fellowship, with goals 
of publication. 

Swanson, a graduate of the MFA 

program and now the publishing 
company’s director, takes on five 
“Printer’s Devils” from the MFA 
program each year as appren-
tices to the art of printing. As the 
Devils toiled beside us, Swanson 
gave me a tour of the composing 
room, where tiny, silver type let-
ters were scattered on the desk in 
compartmentalized 
categoriza-

tions. For each piece printed, they 
must set each individual letter in 
place, tighten them into a “chase” 
frame and then cast the entirety 
in metal. This can be an extremely 
tedious and arduous process over 
the course of many months. 

He shows me a recently print-

ed poem — an inauguration gift 
for the new University President 
Mark Schlissel — beautifully inked 
in a sophisticated maize-and-
blue script. The finished prod-
uct exudes effortlessness at first 
glance, but the complexity behind 
the aesthetic accentuates the 
intellect on the page. 

A printing enthusiast since 

middle school, Swanson started 
the press a year ago in an effort 
to salvage materials from a clos-
ing print shop in Muskegon. His 
initial intention was to revive the 

classic craft — but his lofty aims to 
bring back an archaic method of 
printing have reasons beyond his-
torical preservation. 

“I wanted this shop to be not 

just to make pretty things, but to 
be a place where all of that his-
tory lives and we can talk about 
it, not in the abstract,” Swanson 
said. “You sit down and set type, 
especially at the speed that we 
set at, and you can spend several 
minutes with a word. You contem-
plate the language at such a dif-
ferent speed, it changes the way 
you write, it changes the way you 
think about words, it changes the 
way you think about letters … (It’s 
an) opportunity for a writer to see 
writing from a truly novel per-
spective.” 

As I marvel, he tells me the sto-

ries of Mark Twain and Ambrose 
Bierce, literary legends who both 
started their careers as printing 
devils. Swanson hopes to offer the 
same humble rooting to MFA stu-
dents who also aspire to become 
revered writers in the future. He 
has the crucial responsibility of 
fostering and furthering their love 
for the language and their rela-
tionship with words. He certainly 
supplements their graduate expe-
rience, because behind the press 
lies a vibrant program of passion-
ate individuals.

I met up with two of these stu-

dents — a tall man with a trapper 
hat that covers his eyes and a dain-
ty young woman with a colorful 
dress and an even brighter person-
ality. As we sat down, they offered 
me a cookie and a half-gallon of 
chocolate milk. 

They certainly did not have the 

high-strung, uptight personas of 
some graduate students drown-
ing in their work, especially for 
students in the second-highest-
ranked creative writing master’s 
program in the country. They 
sarcastically taunted each other, 
but amid the teasing, it was clear 
they held a deep respect for each 
other’s works. 

Menachem Kaiser graduated 

from Columbia University with 
degrees in economics and phi-
losophy, and has since published 
his work at sites such as the Wall 
Street Journal, The Atlantic, Slate 
and the New Yorker. Christin Lee, 
who started as a studio arts major 
at Loyola Marymount University 
in Los Angeles, balances Kaiser’s 
eccentric nature with her own 
quirky personality. Both are first-
year students pursuing fiction 

writing. 

As we began to talk about their 

experiences in Helen Zell, they 
very quickly corrected a silly mis-
conception of mine: not everyone 
in the MFA has roots in an English 
or writing major. The program 
allows opportunities for people 
from eclectic backgrounds, all 
bonded simply by their passion for 
writing.

Lee intends to produce a col-

lection of fiction short stories, and 
Kaiser, a novel following themes 
that speak to his Jewish identity. 
However, beyond those simple 
descriptors, they confessed that 
they did not have much of a direc-
tion. Though initially surprised, 
my qualms were assuaged as I 
realized that I was not the only 
one still figuring my life out. Even 
as masters students, their inten-
tions were simply to absorb all 
they could and to refine their craft, 
all alongside a cohort who were in 
the same boat of exploration and 
experimentation.

For the writers, the crux of the 

program culminates in exclusive, 
closed workshops. The MFA pro-
gram has only 22 students — 12 in 
fiction and 10 in poetry. Though 
they only spend two years togeth-
er, the students foster very close 
connections with each other, their 
professors and other faculty mem-
bers. In their regular workshops, 
each of their peers dedicates a 
week to revising each other’s work 
and then advising each other on 
their progress. 

“In the real world, it’s very hard 

to find someone who’s willing to 
sit down and read and discuss your 
6000 words,” Kaiser said. “It’s a 
weird family experience in a lot of 
ways. But there’s something just 
really special just having 11 other 
people, just in your corner, who 
are really going to give the time 
and attention.” 

I met up with Douglas Trevor, 

associate professor of English and 
Creative Writing at the Univer-
sity, later that afternoon. While at 
Princeton for his undergraduate 
degree, he studied comparative 
literature and creative writing 
with acclaimed writers such as 
Joyce Carol Oates and Toni Mor-
rison. His work has received wide 
laudation as well, including the 
Balcones Fiction Prize for his 
most recent novel, “Girls I Know.” 
Though he was not a University 
MFA graduate, he is certainly one 
of the most popular professors in 
the English Department among 
both graduate and undergraduate 
students. Trevor, like the students 
who now look up to him, started 
with modest roots — a story writ-
ten at age six about a caveman 
named 
“Cow-Wow-Bow-Wow,” 

sparking his fascination with sto-
rytelling. 

“(The MFA community) is very 

close,” Trevor said. “The groups 
of students who come, they get to 
know each other very well. They 
spend a lot of time with each other. 
We have dinners with the writ-
ers, we spend a lot of time with 
the students and we spend a lot 
of time with each other as faculty 
members. The best thing about the 
program is the opportunity to get 
to know each other.” 

The MFA program is a chain 

reaction: the students are fueled 
by their professors who are direct-
ed by their administrators — it’s 

all one beautifully functioning 
system that buttresses everyone’s 
efforts.

I met with Michael Byers and 

Megan Levad, the director and 
assistant director of the Helen Zell 
Writers’ Program, respectively, in 
the most stereotypical of writer’s 
offices — a rainbow array of books 
on every single wall, a mobile 
standing desk and little Lego figu-
rines on the coffee table. Levad, a 
poet and lyricist, and Byers, a nov-
elist with three published books, 
consider themselves not only 
esteemed writers but also dual 
professors and administrators. 

In many ways, they seemed to 

resemble older, matured versions 
of Kaiser and Lee — Byers, whose 
gray eyes stared into space while 
he joked about his MMA fighter 
alter ego, and Levad, donned in a 
llama-print shawl and spoke with 
a soft, but enthused, tone. 

Most people don’t think of 

writers as “famous” unless they 
have 
a 
blockbuster 
franchise 

movie to accompany their novels. 
But in writing and higher aca-
demia, Trevor, Byers and Levad 
are most admired for their work. 
Unlike in Hollywood, they are 
not “untouchable” figures of bril-
liance, aloof from the aspirants in 
the field; rather, they are eager to 
assist budding writers. 

Though Levad has her under-

graduate degree from the Uni-
versity of Iowa, and Byers has his 
from Oberlin College, both are 
alumni of the Helen Zell Writ-
ers’ Program who have returned 
now as administrators. They both 
spoke to the program as a com-
munity, rather than a hierarchy 
of faculty over students. Everyone 
is closely knit, and all their work 
is pertinent to each other’s. Byers 
and Levad note how their admin-
istrative job is threefold, but ancil-
lary to their roles as teachers and 
writers. 

“I would not be a good teacher of 

young writers if I was not a writer 
first,” Byers said. “There were a lot 
of people that I liked and admired 
here. My experience was produc-
tive and crucial to my career, and 
I thought (Michigan) was not only 
an opportunity to come back and 
work with people who I knew 
were expert at what they did, but 
also a chance to return a little of 
the investment that they made in 
me to others.”

“Because I went through this 

program and because I also teach, 
I think that as an administrator, I 
can see how what we do in admin-
istration can best serve students,” 
Levad adds. “Everything we do in 
administration should be aimed 
at what’s happening in student 
learning and in faculty research 
and writing.” 

It’s clear that the MFA is a rig-

orous program, but it is one with 
a liberating freedom of expression 
that the faculty encourages. When 
I asked Kaiser and Lee about their 
dissertations, they recoiled at the 
wording. Not a dissertation, not a 
thesis, but rather a creative project. 
There isn’t a harsh formality to 
the program that requires the aus-
tere terminology of “dissertation,” 
which could imply a mandated, 
toilsome, daunting concept. The 
MFA program is about creating 
passion projects — works of pride 
to be relished, shared and enjoyed. 
The program may be demanding, 

but the faculty structure the expe-
rience to afford liberties other 
fields may not.

“When I was here, I felt like 

my experience mattered to more 
people than just me,” Byers said. 
“I felt as though my professors 
were attentive to the experience 
that I was having. I assumed that 
was the model for how an MFA 
program was supposed to be run 
— student-centered with attention 
to what the experience actually 
is, a sense of a need for a balance 
between the individual experience 
being as important as the experi-
ence of the group as a whole.” 

“Once (our students) get here, 

they have their talent nurtured,” 
Levad adds. “But they also make 
wonderful connections with their 
classmates, entering the literary 
community is a real source of sus-
tenance for people because if you 
see that the folks around you are 
continuing to write and are get-
ting their work out there, then it 
makes it feel much more possible 
that you can do the same.” 

Each individual in the program, 

whether a student, professor or 
administrator, is in on a collec-
tive effort to keep their art form 
alive and appreciated. They are a 
most vibrant support system, and 
beyond their personal endeavors, 
the community’s goals become 
their own, their success a shared 
one for the literary world. This 
world, unfortunately, is one that 
popular media enjoys critiquing 
for being archaic, one that some 
scholars lament for “dying.” But 
Kaiser sees something different 
in this literary world, one teeming 
with emotion. 

“It’s all the things you relate to 

in the world, and to other people 
that’s beyond facts and data and 
numbers and figures,” Kaiser 
said. “Stuff like words, stuff like 
empathy and sympathy, love and 
heartbreak and tragic and loss and 
relation. Those are the things you 
learn through literature.” 

He pauses a moment. “Man, 

I’ve been in parts of my life where 
I just didn’t have exposure to any 
of this stuff, and it’s an emptier 
place.” 

Lee 
continues, 
“Identity, 

nation-states — the whole thing is 
narrative. Religion, history — it’s 
all narrative. The desire to master 
that on some level is a desire to just 
understand the world.”

“Our toolboxes as thinkers 

are really, really enriched when 
we try to think about subjects 
and texts that don’t reveal them-
selves,” Trevor said. “We have 
to remind those who are adverse 
to the humanities, or those who 
don’t know entirely what we do, 
that our projects are primarily 
about sharpening analytical skills. 
(They’re) also a larger project 
about theorizing what it means to 
empathize and to think about the 
world from other people’s points 
of view. I can’t think of anything 
more valuable than that.” 

Levad adds, “It seems to me 

that people are more engaged 
with literature. I know we like to 
bemoan the loss of the book, but 
there’s always more exciting new 
books coming out and indepen-
dent presses are still continuing to 
publish great work.”

Together, their literary world 

seeks answers to human nature 
and the key to empathy. It seems 
as if every process is intercon-
nected — the independent presses 
Levad speaks of, the writers and 
teachers alike. I wrapped up each 
interview by asking for words of 
advice for aspiring writers, and 
their primary responses were the 
same: simply, to read and to write.

As Trevor puts it, “Read widely, 

and spend time thinking about 
how to revise one’s own work. 
Become accustomed to reading 
your own work, as well as the 
work of other people. And think 
about writing as a cerebral exer-
cise, something you have to do 
every day to be in good shape.” 

 “Read voraciously, and broadly. 

And write as often as you can,” 
Levad adds. “Try out different 
things. Think about the way lan-
guage works. Think about syntax 
and grammar — where do those 
conventions come from? Think 
about etymology. Language is the 
material of our art form — it’s our 
medium — so learn all you can 
about language.”

After a week of following the 

MFA program from the roots 
up, from the words at the print-
ing press, to the words the stu-
dents write, to the professors who 
inspire the students and finally, to 
the administrators who point the 
program in the right direction, I 
know that they embody an effer-
vescent community that tells the 
stories of all of our lives.

SINGLE REVIEW

There’s still no news on 

when 
Frank 
Ocean 
will 

release his next album, but 
this 
week-

end 
the 

R&B singer 
gave fans a 
reminder of 
his immense 
talents, 
releasing on 
his 
Tum-

blr a cover 
of “At Your 
Best (You Are Love),” a track 
originally done by The Isley 
Brothers and later covered 
by Aaliyah, in honor of what 
would’ve 
been 
Aaliyah’s 

36th birthday.

While Aaliyah improved 

upon the Isleys’ bedroom 
jam with her beautiful, soul-
ful vocals and a more con-
temporary 
instrumental 

accompaniment, Ocean takes 
the song in another direc-
tion. The Princess of R&B is 
soft, seductive and inviting; 
Ocean sounds heartbroken 
and isolated, accompanied 
only by his keyboard and 

the haunting echoes of his 
own voice. Though lone-
lier and more closed-off, 
Ocean’s take on the song 
is just as powerful as its 
other versions. His voice 
hits notes even higher than 
Aaliyah’s, his words sound-
ing like unconscious emis-
sions of his most personal 

inner thoughts. The sparse 
arrangement recalls Kanye 
West’s recent “Only One,” 
and this pleasantly surpris-
ing release from Ocean will 
vault him right back up with 
Kanye on everyone’s “Most 
Anticipated Albums of 2015” 
lists.

EPISODE REVIEW

I’m always impressed by 

“Law and Order: Special Vic-
tims Unit.” The writing, acting 
and execution 
are consistently 
amazing, 
and 

this week’s epi-
sode didn’t dis-
appoint. “Agent 
Provocateur” 
had one of the 
most 
artistic 

beginnings 
the show has 
seen in a long 
time, which is 
impressive see-
ing as part of 
it involved an unconscious girl 
being stuffed unceremoniously 
into a suitcase and left in an 
alleyway.

The episode draws attention 

to the increasingly blurred lines 
of communication on social 
media, in this case between 15 
year old Madison Baker (Madi-
son Grace, “Nova Road”) and the 
object of her obsession, sleazy 
Hollywood star Scott Russo 
(Shiloh Fernandez, “Red Riding 
Hood”). They apparently spend 
a night together that Madison 

says she doesn’t remember — 
but it’s unclear whether this is 
because of the drugs and alco-
hol in her system, or something 
else. Russo is in the city promot-
ing his new movie — ironically 
about being framed for a crime 
he didn’t commit — with a col-
league, who is later revealed to 
be Madison’s seducer. The epi-
sode is a whirlwind of he-said, 
she-said, edited video footage 
and purposely leaked informa-
tion to disreputable news source 
LMZ. During the episode’s final 
moments, Benson catches a brief 

knowing look shared between 
the 
Franco-esque 
star 
and 

another cute young girl, and her 
realization that it might have all 
been planned is the type of last-
minute realization that “SVU” 
rarely utilizes — but, as in this 
episode, always uses powerfully. 

And if none of this intrigues 

you enough, you should know 
that legend Patti LuPone also 
makes an appearance as the 
stars’ cold and calculating man-
ager — giving a dynamic per-
formance as always.

On new mixtape, 
Lil Wayne airs his 

grievances 

By WILL GREENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Lil Wayne is incredibly sorry. 

Again.

For the second time in a row, 

Wayne is battling his label, Cash 
Money, 
to 

release the next 
installment 
in 

his Tha Carter 
album 
series. 

Tha Carter V 
was originally 
scheduled 
to 

come out late 
October 
2014, 

then early December. The release 
date is now TBD.

As an apology to his fans, 

Wayne released “Sorry 4 the Wait 
2,” a mixtape of his own rap on top 
of other artists’ beats and some of 
his own. It’s a move akin to that 
of Leslie Knope (I was late on a 
deadline? Here’s a “little some-
thing” I threw together for you). 
For fans, it’s hard to stay mad at a 
guy who keeps his constituency at 
the forefront of his mind.

Now, I should make a brief 

disclaimer: I’ve long had mixed 
feelings about Lil Wayne. On one 
hand, I spent half of my fresh-
man year playing his bangers on 
repeat in my dorm room, memo-
rizing every word of songs like 
“A Milli,” “6 Foot 7 Foot” and 
“Love Me.” On the other hand, 
I’m 
generally 
underwhelmed 

by his deeper tracks. His work 
as a whole doesn’t grab me, and 
he’s not in my top five. As a rock 
analogy, I’d compare him to Van 
Halen: there’s plenty of talent to 
be impressed with, but purists of 
the genre probably don’t consider 
it top echelon material. That said: 

I found plenty to like in this tape.

Sorry 4 the Wait 2 goes beyond 

a mere apology project. Notable 
tracks include previously released 
“Shit,” and “Fingers Hurting,” 
both examples of Lil Wayne in 
prime form. He gives his own 
take on some of the hottest beats 
from 2014, including “Tuesday” 
(ILoveMakonnen), “Hot Nigga” 
(Bobby Shmurda)and “Drunk in 
Love” (Beyoncé). I’d even say he 
tops the original artists on “No 
Type” (Rae Sremmurd) and 
“Coco” (O.T. Genasis).

In true Weezy fashion, the 

rap is a mix of aggressive flow 
and slower discussions of his 
encounters with notably attrac-
tive women. There are also plen-
ty of Wayne’s classic two-line 
zings that make me smile in spite 
of myself — like on “Trap House” 
where he says “I wrote a letter to 
my competition / it started off 
with dearly departed.”

Included on the tape are ade-

quate contributions from Drake 
and 2 Chainz. Also featured are 
the lesser known Mack Maine 
and Shanell, as well as Chris-
tina Milian on “Drunk In Love.” 
Each track is laced with apolo-
gies as Wayne flexes his rapping 
prowess across 17 songs.

Weezy fans should be satis-

fied for a short time with this 
mixtape. Why shouldn’t they 
be? Wayne is going beyond the 
call of duty here so he can only 
surpass expectations in my eyes. 
Plus, he’s putting out more music 
while waiting for his eleventh 
studio album. He’s no slouch.

So, no need to apologize to us, 

Weezy. I’m sorry for you.

Wayne has publicly expressed 

his understandable frustration 
with Cash Money. This is the 
second major release he’s had 
to delay — the rapper issued 
Sorry 4 the Wait in 2011 when 
Tha Carter IV’s release was 

similarly delayed. Wayne took 
to Twitter this past December, 
reporting “To all my fans, I want 
u to know that my album won’t 
and hasn’t been released bekuz 
Baby & Cash Money Rec. refuse 
to release it,” adding in another 
Tweet that “this is not my fault.” 
He also announced his inten-
tions to get out of the “f***ed up” 
situation soon at the Vice 20th 
Anniversary concert; his man-
ager quickly denied that Wayne 
would be leaving Cash Money, 
saying he was “being sarcastic.”

It’s hard to downplay how 

detrimental label issues can be 
for rap artists. The most nota-
ble example is probably Azealia 
Banks, 
whose 
debut 
album 

Broke With Expensive Taste was 
delayed for over two years and 
was only released in Septem-
ber 2014 after she left Universal 
Music in July. During the wait, 
Banks lost most of the hype 
she’d accumulated with her sin-
gle “212” and another, similarly 
named, female rapper rose into 
the spotlight. Obviously, Wayne 
isn’t fighting to get noticed as 
an up-and-comer the way Banks 
was, but the delay could very 
well prove damaging to Tha 
Carter V’s legacy.

Instead of releasing the album 

in 2014, a relatively quiet year for 
hip-hop releases in my eyes, he 
will now have to fight for noto-
riety with Kanye West, Kend-
rick Lamar, Lupe Fiasco, Drake, 
Big Sean, A$AP Rocky, Pusha T, 
Earl Sweatshirt, Kid Cudi — the 
list goes on and on.

This isn’t at all to say that the 

album will go unnoticed, and if 
Sorry 4 the Wait 2 is any indica-
tor, then it could very well hold 
its own as a top album of the 
year. Still, I think it’s safe to say 
us listeners are more concerned 
if Lil Wayne can survive the wait 
— not the other way around.

VIRGINIA LOZANO/Daily

Taylor directs the University’s undergraduate creative writing program.
Keith Taylor talks 
the poetry of nature

University 

professor shares 

creative inspiration

By CATHERINE SULPIZIO

Senior Arts Editor

“I’m not much of an academ-

ic,” Keith Taylor says to a dubi-
ous interviewer. 

Despite what some would call 

his lack of traditional academic 
pedigree, it’s clear that the 
coordinator for the University’s 
undergraduate creative writing 
program, Bear River Writers’ 
Conference director and poetry 
editor for the Michigan Quar-
terly Review speaks the schol-
arly language. Taylor is telling 
me about working in Ann Arbor 
bookstores in the ’80s through 
’90s, specifically in Shaman 
Drum, one of those bookstores 
that doesn’t exist anymore, lit-
erally (it closed in 2009) and 
figuratively (its tagline was 
“academic and scholarly books 
in the humanities”). 

Despite his easy admission 

that Ann Arbor’s bookstore 
scene is a ghost of itself, there 
is a vital, persisting joy Taylor 
holds for the printed page. I 
was briefly in his intermediate 
poetry class last fall, and he is 
the type of teacher whose joy 
for the text is infectious, one 
who promises to restore the 
immediate pleasure of reading 
to literature’s sometimes anti-
septic field of study. If you need 
convincing, listen to Taylor 
read Pablo Neruda’s “Ode to My 
Socks” (hint: you’ll have to take 
his class); his voice takes on the 
same woolen, nubby texture as 
Neruda’s language, warm and 
dry. It’s the poet’s recitation, by 
an artist who knows his craft 
inside and out, and understands 
how poetry blurs its linguistic 
and spatial modalities: “Ode to 
My Socks” is a long, thin poem, 
not unlike a pair of socks. 

Yet beneath Taylor’s elemen-

tal regard for poetry, which 
strikes the observer as visceral 
and instantaneous, is a long and 
winding, self-informed study. 
Taylor’s trajectory as a poet 
started after moving to South 
Bend, Indiana, in seventh grade. 
Raised in a self-described “reli-
gious Mennonite family” in 
rural Western Canada, to Tay-
lor, urban South Bend in the late 
’60s was a culture shock. 

“I spoke funny,” Taylor said. 

“My English teacher used to fail 
me because I spelled ‘color’ and 
‘meter’ and ‘favor’ and ‘center’ 
wrong. I didn’t know anybody, 
only had a couple friends.”

But sometime around then, 

Taylor wrote a rudimentary 
poem. 

“I was looking out my win-

dow, looking at snow falling on 

our blue-collar neighborhood in 
South Bend and I wrote some 
words down. I went to school 
— I was Taylor, near the end of 
the alphabet, and I was next to 
this guy Zart — and I showed it 
to him. He said, ‘That should be 
a poem, actually.’ I asked, ‘Well 
what’s a poem do?’ and he said, 
‘You spread it out across the 
page and make it look funny.’ 
So I did, and it was the first 
stroke I got in American school; 
my teacher loved it. And then 
I realized poets were so cool. I 
wasn’t an athlete and there’s no 
way I could be cool, except by 
being different.”

Afterward, Taylor read vora-

ciously. I asked him who he was 
reading when he was 16. 

“Oh everybody, I was read-

ing everything. I was reading 
biographies,” he said, naming 
off a handful of touchstones 
for every young writer — Yeats, 
the High Modernists Eliot and 
Pound — before continuing, “I 
had no one teaching me. But 
when I was 16 or so, I got kind 
of obsessed with Kazantzakis.” 

Nikos Kazantzakis, that is, 
 

the Greek author known for 
that vibrant work “Zorba the 
Greek,” a restless, poetic paean 
to the sensual life. The book is 
tamped with, as Taylor put it, 
“sex, sand and passion.” And 
it’s fitting that adolescent Tay-
lor zeroed in on an author who 
wrote about the call to adven-
ture. After a semester in col-
lege, Taylor moved to Europe 
for four years, during which 
he worked a series of manual 
jobs: washing dishes, sweeping 
floors and building houses, all 
while he learned French so he 
could read the country’s litera-
ture. 

By the time Taylor returned 

to the United States, he had 
been submitting work to liter-
ary journals since the age of 16 
(he recalls mailing poems to 
Harper’s in high school), and 
first got published at 18. And, 
as he worked his way through 
Ulrich’s, the original Borders 
and Shaman Drum, Taylor con-
tinued writing. At the time — 
the mid-eighties — Ann Arbor 
was something of a book-lov-
er’s utopia. 

“If Borders had stayed an 

Ann Arbor store, we were going 
to build the best bookstore on 
the world, right on State Street. 
They were very generous with 
what they paid, with profit 
sharing at the end of the year, 
but that all changed when they 
went corporate, so I left in ’89.”

It was an opportune moment. 

Taylor continued, “All the way 
through the eighties I was 

writing. 
I 
published 
some 

chapbooks, and was published 
pretty widely in the regional 
press. But then, in 1991, I got a 
fellowship in poetry from the 
National Endowment for the 
Arts. I was the only writer to 
get one in Michigan for a few 
years. So that’s when the Uni-
versity asked me to teach. Now, 
it’s a prize that when people 
get, they take a few years off, 
but for me it freed me up so that 
I could teach.” 

Taylor’s poetry is the lan-

guage of nature. He bird-
watches, collaborates with the 
University’s School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance on environ-
mental 
performances 
and 

spends summers at the Uni-
versity’s 
Biological 
Station. 

In 1991, Taylor participated 
in Isle Royale National Park’s 
Artist-in-Residence 
Program 

near Lake Superior and wrote 
a series of poems about the 
island’s famous wolf study, 
which according to its web-
site, is “the longest continuous 
study of any predator-prey sys-
tem in the world.” And when 
we met at recently opened The 
Espresso Bar in Ann Arbor, 
Taylor had just come from a 
meeting in the Program for the 
Environment. 

I asked how his nature 

poems grappled with politics. 
Hidden beneath his poems, 
with their unadorned, careful 
language that brings to bear 
their subject’s sprawling sover-
eignty, how could there not be? 
The political focus was not eas-
ily excavated, Taylor believed. 

“I like to think there is a 

political 
undertone 
to 
my 

poems, especially ones about 
the natural world,because of 
the loss.” Taylor said, “But I 
don’t believe loss is irreparable. 
I don’t believe that’s all we have 
to write about.”

“In the prose, in the reviews 

or the articles,” he continued, 
“I’ll be more explicit about 
political 
and 
environmental 

issues, but they have become 
rather hidden in my poems, 
especially in my mature work.”

And 
as 
the 
conversation 

turned to the Romantics — 
that revolutionary group of 
artists who confronted the 
political system with their 
nature-imbued, 
emotionally 

cued poetry — Taylor seemed 
to answer his question further: 
“The contrast of what they 
were writing about, about as 
opposed to the political system, 
made itself so obvious that it 
was a political moment.” 

Taylor’s poems bristle with 

life. 
Ancient 
figures 
drift 

through the scapes, perhaps 
mechanized by his long-held 
interest in Greek language and 
writing, and their details — the 
narrators, the characters, the 
spaces — which pivot between 
center and periphery, are culled 
and placed for maximum effect. 
In a scattering of lines, Taylor’s 
words snap to life.

Keith Taylor’s latest chap-

book of poetry and prose Fideli-
ties will be published in 2015 by 
Alice Greene & Co.

TRAILER REVIEW

Immediately 
illuminated 

by a sort of wizard-rabbit, the 
name of George Lucas’s pro-
duction com-
pany 
casts 

a shadow of 
expectancy 
over the trail-
er of “Strange 
Magic.” 
The 
mysti-

cal world of 
the 
film 
is 

divided into a kingdom of the 
traditionally “good” and cute 
creatures, while the “bad” 
creatures must reside in a 
dark forest. A potion destroys 
the order of things, and a 
menagerie of elves, fairies and 
some wooden-looking goblins 
must fight to restore it.

The 
musical 
draws 
on 

familiar songs from Michael 
Franti and The Temptations 
to move along the skimpy 
storytelling. While the voice 
acting and singing appears 
adequate and the animation 

looks brilliant, the story gets 
lost in the haze of jokes and 
child-like elves warning that 
derrières should “prepare to 
be shaken.” 

Lucas’s act of attempted 

ostranenie for these univers-
es is unfortunately derivative 
of many films before it, nota-
bly “Epic” and “Shrek.” The 
trailer also gives no indica-
tion of the voice actors behind 

the visually stunning char-
acters, though if one were so 
inclined they could find a cast 
including Kristin Chenoweth, 
Maya Rudolph and Alan Cum-
ming. While unshakably sim-
ilar to other films of its kind, 
the animation and talents of 
the voice acting of “Strange 
Magic” may prove to be its 
saving graces.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

Charli XCX and Rita Ora take 

us on a neon-filtered, Thelma 
and 
Louise-reminiscent 
ride 

in their new 
video for the 
UK 
version 

of 
Charli’s 

“Doing It.” 

We watch 

these 
two 

badass bandits 
rob 
a 
gas 

station 
and 

evade the police while getting 
chased through the desert in 
their bright pink monster truck. 
Along the way, they encounter 
some 
nipple 
tassel-wearing 

police officers and even enjoy 
a good, old-fashioned bull ride. 
Unlike the movie, the video ends 
on a happier note, with a loosely 
choreographed dance number 
featuring Charli in a platinum 
pink, 
barely-there 
cowgirl 

outfit. The outrageous video 

pairs well with the lighthearted 
track, making it an undeniably 
good time. 

“Doing 
It” 
originally 

appeared on Charli’s critically 
successful 2014 album Sucker. 
This new version of the track, 

which includes the seamlessly 
blended verse from Ora, was 
released earlier this year and 
will be featured on the UK 
version of Sucker, set for release 
in February.

ADAM 

THEISEN

O

ne of the best records 
of 2014 was completely 
absent from many “Top 

Albums of the Year” lists. From 
Pitchfork to the young passion-
ate writers here at The Michigan 
Daily, this stunning, singular, 
fantastic release got way less 
acknowledg-
ment than it 
deserved.

That 
may 

seem like a 
relatively 
minor 
slight 

to 
write 
a 

whole column 
about — obvi-
ously, music is 
a very subjec-
tive experience, and arguments 
rooted in personal taste rarely 
go anywhere productive. But this 
album, while certainly incred-
ible from a purely technical point 
of view, needs and deserves as 
much exposure as it can possi-
bly get — not just because of its 
musicianship, but because it truly 
has something to say. This record 
carries a message that we all need 
to keep in our heads as we enter 
this year, and it sets the bar for 
what music should be in 2015.

It’s inexcusable to me how 

many 
publications 
omitted 

Against Me!’s Transgender Dys-
phoria Blues from their year-end 
lists. True, the album (released 
almost exactly one year ago now) 
earned solid rankings from Spin, 
Time and Rolling Stone (not to 
mention serious praise from 
Vice), but I think it’s a real shame 
that Transgender Dysphoria Blues 
couldn’t make it onto The Daily’s 
best-of list, and only squeaked 
into Pitchfork’s “Honorable Men-
tions” category. This is an album 
that you cannot praise enough, 
and it’s an extraordinarily rel-
evant example of courage and 
individuality that should set the 
template for 2015’s crop of new 
music.

I first came across Against Me! 

when I was in early high school, 
when the band’s primary song-
writer/lead guitarist/singer was 
known publicly as Tom Gabel. 
Against Me! had a few catchy 
songs that got occasional airplay 
on alternative radio (“Thrash 
Unreal” and ” “I Was a Teen-
age Anarchist”), but they were 
little more than a blip on my 
music radar. When Against Me!’s 
leader took the name Laura Jane 
Grace and came out as a trangen-
der woman to Rolling Stone, I 
thought it was cool that alt-rock, 
a genre sometimes lacking in 
diversity, suddenly had much a 
much more visible LGBTQ pres-
ence.

It wasn’t until a year and a half 

later, when Transgender Dyspho-
ria Blues was getting buzz in more 
mainstream spaces, that Against 
Me! became prominent in my 
musical consciousness. I listened 
to the record and immediately 

knew that Laura Jane Grace was 
on a higher artistic plane than 
she had ever been before. Track 
One, the title track, starts off like 
pretty much any other pop-punk 
Against Me! track — a prominent, 
marching drumbeat, some guitar 
riffs and a “Hey!” — but as soon 
as Grace’s vocals enter the mix, 
I knew this album was a game-
changer. The singer, presum-
ably singing to her younger self, 
berates herself, screaming, “Your 
tells are so obvious / Shoulders 
too broad for a girl” and, with 
shocking force, “You’ve got no 
cunt in your strut!” “You want 
them to notice / The ragged ends 
of your summer dress,” she tells 
herself. “They just see a faggot,” 
she angrily admits.

Ironically, it’s difficult to be 

different in a genre that prides 
itself on non-conformity, but 
Grace’s lyrics don’t just tear 
apart punk rock norms: they are 
radically different from anything 
I’ve heard in music. Transgender 
Dysphoria Blues is the most pas-
sionate burst of catharsis I’ve 
ever experienced. Like so much 
great writing, it’s heartbreak-
ingly specific but universally 
relatable for anyone who’s ever 
been a teenaged outcast of any 
gender or sexuality. There’s pain, 
rage, depression and alienation in 
Grace’s vocals, but there’s also tri-
umph. While the timespan of the 
record isn’t wide enough in scope 
to explicitly include this, implicit 
in all of her songs is the idea the 
Grace has fucking made it past the 
seemingly infinite darkness that 
so many young transgender peo-
ple have to experience. She’s done 
it. She makes awesome punk rock 
and gets interviewed by hugely 
influential journalists and makes 
a living doing what she loves 
despite living in a society that’s 
still extremely prejudiced against 
who she is.

I’ve been thinking even more 

about 
Transgender 
Dysphoria 

Blues since I heard about the sui-
cide of Leelah Alcorn, a 17-year 
old transgender girl from Ohio 
whose parents oppressed her 
identity, her alienation eventually 
leading her to end her life.

Rock stars aren’t role mod-

els. They’re human, they’re fal-
lible and they’re bound to do some 
things that fans don’t want to hear 
about. That said (and I’m abso-
lutely speaking from personal 
experience here), teenagers will 
always idolize musicians. Wheth-
er it’s tragic figures like Kurt 
Cobain and Jimi Hendrix, abra-
sive geniuses like Bob Dylan and 
Kanye West or punk-rock mold-
breakers like Kathleen Hanna and 
Laura Jane Grace, kids who fall in 
love with these artists’ works will 
inevitably comb through the lyr-
ics and watch plenty of interviews 
so they can imitate their heroes’ 
styles and life philosophies.

Because of this undeniable fact 

of growing up, I’ve been wishing 

that every single outcast teenager 
could listen to Transgender Dys-
phoria Blues. It’s unlikely, because 
of societal oppression and the 
band’s relative obscurity, that 
even a majority of kids will ever 
get to experience this record, but 
that’s exactly why we need more 
of this kind of music. By no means 
do I want to say Against Me! is the 
cure-all for every form of teen-
aged alienation, and I definitely 
have no idea if Leelah Alcorn 
would’ve even liked the album, 
but I couldn’t help remember-
ing when I was in my early teens 
(circa 2010) and struggling with 
identity issues and how happy I 
felt whenever I found a musician 
who seemed to understand me 
(even though I never found any-
one more significant than straight 
play actors like David Bowie, indie 
artists with small followings like 
Rostam Batmanglij or Lady Gaga, 
whatever genre she is). Anytime I 
could find an artist even slightly 
willing to acknowledge that there 
are non-straight sexualities, or a 
song that channeled those other 
identities (say, Franz Ferdinand’s 
“Michael” or Bloc Party’s “I Still 
Remember”), it was an oasis of 
validation in what felt like the 
straightest suburb in Michigan. 
If I was a couple of years younger, 
Laura Jane Grace would’ve easily 
been the dominant LGBTQ role 
model of my iPod.

I realize not everyone expe-

riences life through the lens of 
music like I do, but I know how 
much of a difference art can make 
in anyone’s life. Movies and TV 
shows that represent more than 
just the straight, white male 
experience, music created by 
artists like Laura Jane Grace or 
Frank Ocean who don’t fit “tra-
ditional” notions about gender or 
sexuality, writing by people with 
diverse points of view, these are 
all immeasurably important to 
inspiring young kids who perhaps 
don’t fit the standard representa-
tions they see in the media.

While 2014 was somewhat 

lacking from a music standpoint 
(Igloo Australia and some Cana-
dian-Reggae group dominated 
the charts), Sleater-Kinney has 
already released an album in 2015 
and D’Angelo caught us all at the 
tail end of last year with the mind-
blowing complexity and power of 
Black Messiah. Here’s hoping that 
even more mold-breakers (Kanye? 
Kendrick?) will give us something 
truly special this year. I remember 
being 14 and kind of different and 
searching so hard for other artists 
who were truly different in ways 
I could relate to and that could 
make me more comfortable. For 
2015, let’s pledge to elevate those 
artists who dare to be unique, and 
let’s see them at the top of our 
year-end lists come December.

Sleater-Kinney album. To chat,

Car and train 
crashes inspire 

University student 
printmaker/poet

By ALEX BERNARD

Daily Community Culture Editor

As I walked out of my inter-

view, through studios filled with 
paintings, sculptures and the kind 
of art you can’t describe if you 
don’t study it (I think they call it 
“abstract”), I passed a small rect-
angle of white paper tacked to the 
wall because the tape, clearly, was 
not holding. (You’d think if any-
one had the right tape, it’d be the 
art school). The sheet sat above a 
tiny blue bucket – not much wider 
than the size of my fist – nailed to 
the wall. 

On that slip of paper, written in 

blocky, red marker was:

“IF AT ANY POINT TODAY 

YOU THOUGHT ‘I NEED TO 
KNOCK ON WOOD,’ DIP YOUR 
HAND IN THE BUCKET & 
KNOCK ... IT WILL WASH 
RIGHT OFF.” 

I looked inside. Four nails rest-

ed on the bottom. Hm. Art School. 

I carried on, away from the per-

sonal studios, through the glass 
doors, past a girl in a scarf who 
gave me an aren’t-you-a-little-tall-
to-be-an-art-student look, and out 
into the cold. As I huddled at the 
bus stop, I mentally reviewed my 
interview with Visual Arts stu-
dent Margaret Hitch.

Margaret is a senior BFA stu-

dent in the Stamps School of Art & 
Design. She is a printmaker and a 
poet. Notice I don’t say “or a poet.” 
Margaret matches her prints with 
her poems and her poems with 
her prints to tell stories, many 
of which are autobiographical. 
Sometimes the poems inspire the 
drawings, and sometimes, the 
other way around.

“For this project,” Margaret 

said, “I just kind of picked a selec-
tion of poems and made work off 
of that. Or there was images that 
I made and then I kind of wrote a 
poem after ... I knew that I wanted 
to work with poetry and images 
together.” 

Drawing since eighth grade, 

Margaret has fallen in love with 
printmaking, from its subject 
material to the process to the rath-
er unambiguous final product. 

“I love the physical work you 

have to do ... There is a yes or a no 
answer with something, so there’s 
technique that you have to learn, 
which is kind of nice.”

What’s also nice is that Marga-

ret will have a chance to get her 
yes or no answer. At the end of the 
semester, all senior art students 
are required to present their work 
in a show, either through the Uni-
versity at one of two exhibits or 
through another off site location. 
Margaret, however, had another 
idea. 

“I’m going to have a solo show 

in my bike shed in between my co-
ops. I’m just taking all the bikes 
out and then I’m gonna convert it 
into a gallery space.”

The name of the show is 

“American 
Dreamboat” 
and 

focuses on Margaret’s version of 
the American Dream, with spe-
cial emphasis placed on death, 
human-to-human dynamics and 
travel.

I asked Margaret about how 

travel operates in her work, but 
something else cropped up, some-
thing out of nowhere it seemed. 
Well, not nowhere exactly. 

“I have this poem,” Margaret 

said, “about being on Highway 
One in California and thinking I 
was gonna die, ‘cause I was in car 
crash freshman year and then ever 
since, I’ve been really connected 
to ‘I could possibly die whenever 
I’m in any form of transportation.’

Wait. A car crash?
“It was weird. It was just slip-

pery road and I flipped the Trail-
Blazer three times. Yeah but ... 
everyone gets in a car crash.” 

Well. That was matter-of-fact. 

While I tried to catch up, Marga-
ret calmly explained to me that 
the car crash plays just as much of 
a role in her art as anything else. 

“Yeah it was definitely really 

affecting. (I) definitely have a 
greater appreciation for life. I was 
really not thinking about my mor-
tality at all and now I think about 
my mortality all the time. In a 
good way, in a good way.” 

I breathed, rubbed my sweaty 

palm against my interview note-
book, and asked Margaret about 
her other inspirations. You see, her 
work isn’t only about car crashes 
and travel, per se, but about rela-
tionships and how we choose to 
spend our brief, finite allotments 
of days. Margaret’s tone might be 
casual, but her work is anything 
but. It’s a serious examination of 
the tissue-thin division between 
life and death.

So, a car crash. Of course. 

Makes sense. I was beginning to 
understand her nonchalance. 

“And then I almost got hit by a 

train, so I’m gonna work on some 
woodcuts that–”

Oh good God!
“How did you almost get hit by 

a train?” I asked, interrupting.

“I was on a train bridge, like 

over a frozen lake, and then a 
train came. It was like this typical 
‘Stand By Me’ situation, and we all 
just, like, ran. But the train was 
small enough that it stopped, so it 
was good.”

Me 
(incredulously): 
“What 

were you doing up there?”

“Just 
exploring,” 
Margaret 

said. “You know, being a dumb 
kid. That’s kind of what (my nar-
rative’s) about. It’s about how we 
wanna have this search for adven-
ture and we wanna travel, but 
that’ll just inevitably bring us clos-
er to death and danger. And stuff.”

Yes. Stuff, indeed. 
Margaret’s show, “American 

Dreamboat,” will be April 18th in 
the bike shed between 307 and 315 
N. State Street – or, “between the 
blue and purple co-ops.” There 
will be music, prints and an print-
maker with a proclivity for near-
death narratives.

After 
graduation, 
Margaret 

plans to attend graduate school, 
teach at a university and work 
in her own studio creating more 
prints, poetry and stories. 

“I’m looking for a print studio 

to live and die within. That’s my 
goal ... I love doing it. It’s just too 
much fun.”

Hopefully, one day, Margaret 

will get her own studio and fill it 
with stories about death and mor-
tality and ... stuff. Hopefully. We’ll 
just have to knock on wood. Or 
rather, you will. My bucket’s filled 
with nails.

What we need 

from music in 2015

Men’s style is vastly 
underrated in fashion

By ANDREW MCCLURE

Daily Arts Writer

I like to read, and I like the fact 

that you don’t care that I like to 
read because you’re reading this 
right now. Bret Easton Ellis says 
of one of his novel’s protagonists, 
Patrick Bateman: because he 
wants to fit in. Bateman, the narra-
tor, spends 50 percent of the book 
deconstructing other characters’ 
getups, from cut to designer to 
color-ways and patterns, in obses-
sive detail — detail that makes you 
want to Cliff-Notes the rest of an 
otherwise good book. “He wants 
to fit in.” This reasoning doesn’t 
just capture the essence of the 
entire book but also why most 
men dress the way they do, which 
is, ironically, like boys, because 
boys wear what their mom lays out 
for them. Men, however, choose 
their own shit based on important 
things, like the ability to make 

choices independent of what your 
trusty friend thinks. Men, unlike 
boys, have agency, they have sar-
torial swag and they have back 
hair.

The New York Times, a newspa-

per that still matters, announced 
this week it will launch a “month-
ly, dedicated men’s style section.” 
Its currently thriving Style sec-
tion, which is female fashion dom-
inated and runs every Sunday and 
Thursday, will make room for The 
Men by occupying only the Friday 
spot going forward. So what’s at 
stake besides maybe pissing off the 
three living NYT print subscribers 
over this change? And why is this 
just now happening, in 2015, when 
the Prince of Wales has been drip-
ping with swag since the twenties; 
in other words, men have given a 
shit or two about threads for some 
time, so why does it seem today 
that so many men care so little?

Let’s first address the elephant 

in the room (that is, to anyone who 
has ever read a business article 
with no accompanying pictures): 
NYT is doing this to maximize 
advertising revenues. More copy 
space for Brioni suit and John 
Lobb shoe ads means more $$$ for 
NYT. Money moves. Word? Word.

Let’s also consider the his-

tory of menswear for a minute. 
Between the two World Wars, 
i.e. 1920s and 1930s, men dressed 
better than any other time in 
American history because, despite 
economic chaos, all sectors of 
menswear worked hand-in-hand 
to deliver style and taste. Even the 
Average Jack looked good during 
these years because there was an 
abundance of credible role mod-
els (see: Prince of Wales, Fred 
Astaire), bespoke optionality (see: 
Savile Row in central London) and 
accepted standards of taste (see: 
Esquire and Apparel Arts mens-
wear publications).

I know what you’re think-

ing: We have all three of those 
today, in spades. And you’d be 
right, except today the role mod-
els are less defined and apparent, 
bespoke clothing is something 
seen as only for the ultra-rich (not 
true) and Esquire/GQ are packed 
with more ads and fewer action-
able insights and reflections. 
Everything has been watered 
down, leaving the menswear con-
sumer to rest on bad blends of 
norm-core ickiness and outfits so 
bad, they’re almost creative.

To steal, without shame, from 

legendary menswear designer 
Alan Flusser, “Back in the thir-
ties, stylishness was an exten-
sion of himself, not a designer in 
a store, like today”.

So, if you own a black-as-night 

Canada Goose down jacket and 
you don’t live in subzero towns 
that are mostly white in color, 
hmm. If you own one and can’t 
explain what “down” is, you 
know, the stuff that keeps you 
warm inside that monolith of 
a parka, then I likely hold an 
unfair opinion of you. Sometimes 
— nah — always I think about 
how green that company’s bal-
ance sheet would appear if that 
circular left-arm patch wasn’t 
there, or if it was shaped like a 
penis, or if it was instead just a 

gaping hole in the product itself. 

Look, I still fuck with mall 

staples, on occasion, like J.Crew. 
But I’ll be a monkey’s uncle if 
I told you I was ever remotely 
impressed by an employee’s take 
on anything menswear-related, 
notwithstanding gender and/
or age. Why? Because retail by 
and large fucking sucks. It sucks 
big and it sucks small. High and 
low. By extension, what are most 
retail owners actually paying 
their employees to do outside 
of shelve clothes atop unsold 
clothes and mask their sarto-
rial ignorance with slow, breath-
before-every-word, indoor-voice 
vocal register? Nada.

You can thank the invention 

of shareholder dick-sucking and 
the relegation of quality for the 
fact that you need to spend at 
least $200 for a fair pair of boots. 
There is, however, one thing that 
gives menswear hope and it par-
allels the recent rising popular-
ity of craft beer — some clothing 
makers still hold conviction in 
craftsmanship like the old farts 
almost 100 years ago. Believe it 
or not, good clothiers still take 
pride in their product. You just 
have to know where to look and 
be prepared to spend a bit more 
cheese to find something that’s 
dope and will last. Like every-

thing in life, according to some 
old Boomer lecturing me when-
ever, a sound investment will 
lead to solid returns.

So, in the main, are we dudes 

all fucked? I do realize the world 
has more pressing problems than 
eschewing $175 Timberlands and 
tapered sweatpants from the cur-
rent menswear smog, like, for 
instance, deciding whether Woody 
Allen’s movies are still Oscar-wor-
thy and whether or not Frankie 
Muniz’s hairline is receding. Run-
ning the risk of being pegged a 
millennial blind-optimist, I think 
we sit at an interesting crossroads: 
one stretched between the pre-
eminence of the 1930s (see: Brooks 
Brothers douchebaggery) and the 
1960s Peacock Revolution (see: 
high-end streetwear labels like 
Hood By Air and Rick Owens).

We are getting there. Sort of. 

But until we stop cowering to the 
immense force that is popular 
(albeit, bullshit) opinion, we’ll 
stagnate in the tall-grass marsh-
land of tacky tackiness and lazy 
indifference. No one cares that 
you “don’t” care. And guess 
what? Usually it looks pretty 
gross. Deal with it. And if you 
really, really still want to fit in, 
after your inevitable sartorial 
transformation, grab lunch at 
Revive. It works.
