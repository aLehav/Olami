At 
Tuesday’s 
meeting, 

representatives 
of 
Central 

Student 
Government 

discussed medical amnesty, 
recalling 
representatives, 

an upcoming mental health 
survey and two resolutions.

During 
the 
meeting, 

the assembly voted to call 
on the University to enact 
all-encompassing 
medical 

amnesty, 
including 
drug 

violations, for the University 
and for the state of Michigan. 
Currently, the state provides 
medical amnesty only for 
underage drinking.

At 
Sen. 
Marco 
Rubio’s 

(R–Fla.) 
campaign 
stop 
in 

Michigan on Wednesday, all 
roads led to the American 

Dream.

Weeks 
before 
Michigan’s 

presidential primary on March 
8, Rubio visited the Lacks 
Enterprises Inc. factory — a car 
part manufacturer just outside 
of Grand Rapids.

Two thousand supporters 

gathered 
in 
a 
storage 

warehouse for the company 
to hear Rubio, who discussed 
the burden of student loans 
and what he characterized as 
the country’s failures, ranging 
from military to the current 

campaign.

In particular, Rubio spoke 

of his frustration with current 
levels of student debt in the 
United States — Market Watch 
reported on average a debt of a 
$35,051 for students graduating 
in 2015 — a topic he said he is 
the sole Republican candidate 
to address.

New York-based 

publication 

considered 477 
colleges in study 

By ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

Tuesday, Business First — a 

publication based in Buffalo, 
New York — released an ranking 
of the top public colleges in 
America. The University of 
Michigan placed second in the 
rankings, a drop from its first 
place ranking in 2015. 

The University declined to 

comment on the ranking. 

The University’s first place 

spot was taken this year by the 
University of North Carolina, 
which was the runner up in the 
2015 rankings.

According to the study, the 

University scored 97.621 points 
out of 100. The ranking of 477 
four-year public universities 
is based on 20-part formula 
created 
to 
indicate 
which 

institutions 
offer 
their 

students the best educational 
experience.

The 
formula 
looks 
at 

indicators 
of 
excellence, 

diversity, 
prestige, 

affordability 
and 
economic 

strength.The 
breakdown 
of 

the statistics looked at for each 
university covers a wide range 
of departments. It includes the 
school’s admissions process, 
economic communities, tuition, 
retention 
rates, 
diversity, 

reputations, 
resources 
and 

housing costs.

All 
the 
statistical 

information that was reported 
was from the National Center 
for Education Statistics and the 
U.S. Census Bureau’s American 
Community 
Survey. 
Other 

publications’ college rankings 
— such as the U.S. News and 
Forbes — were also taken into 
consideration.

The University is ranked 

first among the 15 Michigan 
institutions that were included 
in the study. The second was 
Michigan 
State 
University 

in 37th place, and Michigan 
Technological University in 
124th place. 

Event at Michigan 
League draws large 
campus, state crowd

By BRANDON SUMMERS-

MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

A debate featuring controversial 

public figures Julie Bindel and 
Milo Yiannopoulos took place 
Tuesday night in the ballroom of 

the Michigan League.

During the debate, the two 

speakers exchanged arguments 
about feminism, debating whether 
the feminist movement impedes 
an individual’s freedom of speech.

Hosted 
by 
The 
Michigan 

Review, the event drew a crowd of 
several hundred people, some of 
whom drove across state lines to 
hear the pair.

Engineering 
senior 
Hunter 

Swogger, 
one 
of 
the 
event 

organizers, 
said 
the 
Review 

wanted to bring Bindel and 
Yiannopoulos’ 
voices 
to 
the 

University’s campus in order to 
expose the campus to new ideas.

“The entire point is to hear 

prominent people of prominent 
ideologies come together and 
speak,” Swogger said.

Yiannopoulos has been the 

subject of significant criticism 
for his opinions on individual 
feminists and feminist ideology, 
namely his views that feminists 
invent problems that do not exist 

— such as campus rape culture and 
the gender wage gap.

Bindel, who considers herself 

a second-wave feminist — a 
movement 
focused 
sexuality, 

family and workplace issues that 
lasted from the 1960s to the 1980s 
— has also received criticism for 
her treatment of modern feminists 
and the transgender community.

Both Yiannopoulos and Bindel, 

who are British, have been banned 
from multiple universities in the 

Modifications to 
come in light of 

recent shootings in 

Kalamazoo

By RIYAH BASHA

Daily Staff Reporter

Students 
at 
Western 

Michigan University are raising 
questions about the reliability 
and efficiency of emergency 
alerts concerning off-campus 
incidents at their college after 
Saturday night’s mass shootings 
in Kalamazoo.

Jason Dalton, an Uber driver 

in the city, shot eight people 
at random while picking up 
riders 
throughout 
the 
city 

between 6 and 10 p.m., killing 
six and injuring two victims. 
The incidents occurred in three 
separate county jurisdictions 
across the span of more than 
four hours, with Dalton moving 
within two miles of WMU 
grounds at times. No alert was 

sent out by WMU.

WMU junior Philip Faustman 

said he drove by the crime scene 
on his way home from work, but 
had no idea what had occurred.

“I did see about 20 cop cars 

there. I couldn’t find anything 
out until about 11 p.m. when 
local news reported the news,” 
he said. “But on Saturday night 
when kids are out at bars, no 
one’s in dorms, there’s incredible 
on-campus traffic moving off-
campus. When a large chunk of 
the student body is going to be 
affected by this, why was there 
no alert?”

WMU has an emergency 

alert system similar to the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s, 

capable of alerting students, 
faculty and staff by phone and 
e-mail. Unlike the University, 
WMU’s system only reports 
threats occurring directly on 
campus, the minimum required 
of schools by federal law under 
the Clery Act.

After backlash about the lack 

of an alert, WMU president 

GREG GOSS/Daily

English journalist, Mil Yiannopoulus, speaks on issues regarding feminism and mysogyny during the debate against Julie Bindel at the Michigan League ballroom on 
Teusday.

Twenty-nine 

University of Michigan 
students received 
Fulbright grants this 
year — more Fulbright 
scholars than any other 
public university in the 
United States — for the 
third consecutive year, 
according to a press 
release.

Among both public 

and private universities, 
the University was 
ranked only below 
Harvard University, 
which received 31 
Fulbright grants.

The Fulbright 

program provides 
recipients the 

opportunity to conduct 
research, study or 
teach English in over 
140 countries for six to 
12 months. Selection 
is made based on the 
applicant’s’ academic and 
professional records as 
well as on their academic 
project proposals’ 
potential.

Proposed research 

topics and travels for the 
UM recipients vary. One 
recipient, John Doering-
White, a social work 
and anthropology Ph.D. 
candidate, is researching 
undocumented migrants 
in Mexico. Another, 
University alum Layne 

Vandenberg is in Rio 
de Janeiro, Brazil 
researching how 
2016 Olympic Games 
preparations affect low-
income communities.

The U.S. Department 

of State has sponsored 
the Fulbright program 
since 1946, with the aim 
of increasing mutual 
understanding and 
appreciation between 
different cultures. The 
University was the 
top public producer 
of Fulbright scholars 
nationwide in 2005, 2007, 
2008 and 2010-2012.

Panel of experts on U.S. justice system discuss solutions 
to long sentences, high incarceration rates for minorities 

GREG GOSS /Dailly

Angie Martell, Washtenaw County public defender, facilitates a group discussion on national race issues and mass 
incarceration at Hatcher Library’s Gallery Room. 

Event features 

presentations from 
local activists, Ann 

Arbor attorneys

By WILL FEUER

Daily Staff Reporter

“Nobody 
cares 
about 

prisoners, that’s how it is,” 
Jalal Haidar, a sophomore in 

the School of Nursing, said 
Tuesday night to a packed 
room in the Hatcher Gallery. 

Haidar was one of dozens 

of students who participated 
in 
a 
dialogue 
titled 

#WhoWillBeNext: A Dialogue 
on “The New Jim Crow Laws: 
Mass Incarceration in the Age 
of Colorblindness.” Hosted by 
Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs, 
the dialogue focused on the 
treatment 
of 
incarcerated 

individuals and the effect it 

has on society. 

Participants 
sat 
around 

six tables, which were filled 
with University of Michigan 
students, 
community 

organizers, lawyers and clergy 
members, who each debated 
issues 
regarding 
race 
and 

criminal justice. 

The Michigan Daily was 

asked 
not 
to 
include 
any 

remarks made during table 
discussions 
at 
the 
event, 

but did record speakers and 
presenters. 

During the event, Diane 

Smalley, a local community 
activist for female inmates, 
shared stories of young Black 
men and women being handed 
half-life sentences for crimes 
that she said they had clearly 
atoned for before the end of 
their sentences.

Smalley asked participants 

to think about benefits from 
mass incarceration.

“High incarceration means 

high economic activity,” she 
said.

She noted that contracts 

given out by prisons to private 
companies 
for 
prisoner 

necessities 
like 
food 
and 

clothes can be huge sources 
of income and employment for 
those who benefit from the 
process.

Iglesia Martell, an Ann Arbor 

attorney, 
echoed 
Smalley’s 

remarks and said individuals 
who are incarcerated tend to 
be from lower socioeconomic 
backgrounds.

“Judges who have a different 

life experience don’t really 
understand poverty or what 
really drives someone to be in 
the wrong place at the wrong 
time,” Martell said. “People 
who are incarcerated tend 
to be people who are more 
disenfranchised, especially if 

they can’t afford an attorney 
and this tends to be people of 
color.”

During 
table 
discussions 

at the dialogue, participants 
came to the consensus that 
economic 
incentives 
to 

perpetuate the system of mass 
incarceration, 
along 
with 

judges who do not empathize 
with people of color, create a 
system in which individuals 
of color are assigned longer 
prison terms.

Another participant raised 

the point that some people 
believe the U.S. is currently a 
post-racial society, which in 
turn contributes to racism in 
the judicial system.

Maya Finoh, a professor 

at 
Brown 
University, 
said 

though that view of the U.S. 
was inaccurate, several recent 
historical events — namely, the 
election of President Barack 

Obama as the first Black 
president — could explain why 
it exists.

“Just because Barack Obama 

was elected does not mean we 
are living in a post-racialized 
society,” she said. “…I think 
you could make the argument 
that in 2015, we are living in 
a more racist America than in 
1955.”

After 
discussing 
the 

perceived 
issues, 
the 

conversation 
turned 

toward 
potential 
solutions. 

Participants cited education 
for the young and investment 
in poorer areas in particular as 
ways to reduce crime.

Smalley 
pointed 
to 

restorative justice as a way to 
improve the judicial system, 
which is a method by which 
prisoners contact the families 
who were afflicted by their 
crimes and apologize, showing 

genuine remorse.

“It 
forces 
rehabilitating 

criminals to reach out to the 
family in such a way that the 
family recognizes it,” she said.

After the event, Nursing 

junior John Shaver said despite 
the United States having the 
highest 
incarceration 
rate 

in the world, he hopes the 
University will take a stronger 
stand in helping to create a 
judicial system that is not 
critical of people of color.

“The incarceration system in 

the U.S. has been unnecessarily 
racialized and has seeked to 
limit the opportunities of Black 
and brown people,” he said. 
“And I hope that the University 
responds by making some sort 
of an official stance against the 
ways that the judicial system 
has been prejudiced against 
people of color.”

RC Art Gallery 
displays student-
prisoner photos

The Residential College Art 

Gallery in East Quad will display 
student-prisoneer collaborative 
photos through April 8, a 
University press release reports. 
The project is the first ever 
photography workshop in the 
state that included both students 
and inmates, and it was part of 
Humanize the Numbers — an 
ongoing project that connects 
prisoners and community 
members in Southeast Michigan 
through art.

The photography workshop 

took place at Thumb 
Correctional Facility. During 
each session, the inmates would 
share their ideas for an image, 
and the students would then 
capture their vision. 

One of the photos feautured in 

the gallery depicts a chess board 
in which a single black piece lies 
in the shadow of white pieces. 
Another captures an inmate with 
their hands covered in red — 
inmate Johnnie Trice explained 
in a University press release that 
the photo signifies his journey at 
Thumb Correctional Facility. He 
entered with blood on his hands 
and left with paint, he said.

Food bank works 
to counter lead 
effects in Flint

Beginning Feb. 24, the Food 

Bank of Eastern Michigan along 
with the Michigan Department 
of Health and Human Services 
will offer 12 truckloads of food 
to Flint residents, according to 
MLive. The mobile food pantries 
offer choices rich in vitamin C, 
calcium and iron to reduce the 
effects of lead contamination.

Each distribution site expects 

to receive 400 families and 
provide them with healthful 
foods to limit the impact of lead 
exposure. Part of the funding 
was a part of the approved $28 
million supplemental budget 
approved in January.

The first event will be at noon 

on Feb. 24 at Prince of Peace 
Missionary Baptist Church. At 
1 p.m., another distribution site 
will be Salem Lutheran Church.

Retired judge 
expected to be 
DPS transition 
manager

Retired U.S. Bankruptcy 

Judge Steven Rhodes is slated 
to be the transition manager for 
Detroit Public Schools. He will 
meet with district teachers at 
Cass Technical High School on 
Wednesday to discuss his plans 
to transition the Detroit schools 
back to local authority, according 
to the Detroit Free Press.

Rhodes will asssume the 

transitional role after emergency 
manager Darnell Earley’s 
resignation on Feb. 29. Gov. 
Rick Snyder tasked Rhodes with 
guiding and implementing DPS 
reform legislation. He will head 
a leadership transition team, on 
which Tonya Allen, president and 
CEO of the Skillman Foundation, 
has been asked to serve. 

Allen has not yet confirmed 

the postiion. The Free Press 
reported that union officials 
have requested Rhodes consider 
a third person to serve on the 
transition team.

The Detroit school district 

faces a $3.5 billion debt 
and lawsuits rearding the 
teacher sick-outs and poor 
infrastructural conditions 
that closed numerous schools 
over the last several weeks. 
Rhodes played a role during the 
years leading up to the Detroit 
Bankruptcy and in the years 
following.

Rhodes and Snyder met with 

teachers and principals on 
Monday as well to hear feedback 
from the community. State 
lawmakers are still debating 
legislation; however, many of 
the bills still have yet to gain 
widespread support.

NEWS BRIEFS

United Kingdom due to their 
views.

In an e-mail interview with 

The Michigan Daily, University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald wrote 
that Bindel and Yiannopoulos 
were allowed to participate in 
the debate on campus because 
the University strives to allow 
freedom 
of 
speech 
for 
all 

students, 
including 
opinions 

from outside guests.

“The 
university 
feels 
so 

strongly about this topic that our 
commitment is codified in an 
official policy, called a Standard 
Practice 
Guide,” 
Fitzgerald 

wrote.

states 
the 

expression of diverse viewpoints 
is of utmost importance to the 
University community because 
students should both be able to 
express their opinions and be 
able to be exposed to new ideas.

In response to the debate, the 

University’s Spectrum Center 
— which dedicates its efforts to 
LGBTQ awareness on campus — 
offered extended office hours to 
provide an alternative space for 
students who felt threatened by 
the debate.

Engineering freshman Conrad 

Stoll said he was surprised the 
center hosted a safe gathering 
space for members of the LGBTQ 
community during the debate, 
since both Yiannopoulos and 
Bindel are gay.

“I would think that would be 

good,” Stoll said. “There’s two 
renowned people who are in 
the queer community and I was 
really shocked that the Spectrum 
Center acted as if they were 
terrible.”

The Spectrum Center was 

not immediately available for 
comment Tuesday evening. A 
statement on their website reads, 
“We recognize that the rhetoric 
of the speakers featured in this 
event is incredibly harmful to 
many members of our campus 
community. 
The 
Spectrum 

Center will be providing a 
supportive alternative space this 
evening and holding extended 
staffed hours until 9pm. There 
will be no program; our intent is 
to offer a relaxing, positive space 
for students who want to gather 
in community.”

During 
the 
event, 
Bindel 

noted that she was banned from 
multiple academic institutions 
following The Guardian’s 2004 
publication of her article titled 
“Gender 
benders, 
beware,” 

which prompted many in the 
feminist community to label her 
as transphobic. In the article, 
Bindel argues that transgender 
women do not experience the 
same struggles of being women 
since they are born as men. 

“They 
decided 
I 
should 

never 
ever 
be 
redeemed,” 

Bindel said. “All my 35 years of 
unpaid 
activism 
disappeared 

because I was suddenly a vicious 
transphobe.”

Bindel said unlike modern 

day feminism, her feminism 
advocates for the prevention of 
violence against young women 
and girls.

In his remarks, Yiannopoulos 

said he thought modern day 
feminism is dangerous because 
it silences men, compromising 
freedom of speech.

“The problem is that the 

particular modern ground of 
feminism has a problem with 
free speech,” Yiannopoulos said. 
“There’s a particular brand of 
feminism which holds almost 
total sway in the media and in 
gender studies.”

During the debate, the pair 

touched on several gender equity 
issues, such as the wage gap 
between men and women.

Research 
from 
multiple 

sources, such as the federal 
government’s College Scorecard 

released last year, has shown a 
significant gap in pay between 
men and women in a variety of 
professions.

Bindel said the wage gap is 

caused by several factors, one 
of which is the perception of 
women in the workplace among 
their male colleagues.

“Women are punished and 

they’re treated very harshly for 
asking directly, assertively, for a 
pay rise,” she said.

Yiannopoulos countered by 

claiming the wage gap simply 
does not exist. He said instead, 
when women are presented with 
the same opportunities as men, 
such as pursuing a degree in the 
STEM field, they are not as likely 
to complete their education.

“Women don’t work as hard,” 

Yiannopoulos said.

LSA senior Andrea Filisko 

said she came to the debate 
because she believes there is a 
real freedom of speech problem 
on college campuses.

“I don’t know if it’s necessarily 

feminists, but I do think there’s a 
large amount of censorship of the 
right of the political spectrum on 
college campuses,” Filisko said.

Beyond gender, the discussion 

also considered several other 
equity issues.

Yiannopoulos applauded when 

a questioner noted that Michigan 
institutions of higher education 
can no longer take race into 
account during the admissions 
process due to the 2006 adoption 
of Proposal 2 in the state.

He charged that affirmative 

action policies are ineffective 
because real change to solve 
educational inequalities must 
occur at the childhood stage of 
educational development.

“You improve the quality 

of teaching, you don’t pretend 
people are going to deal with a 
course they can’t,” Yiannopoulos 
said.

Bindel said she supported 

affirmative 
action, 
since 

she 
herself 
was 
once 
an 

underprivileged 
student 
in 

England but was able to attend a 
university with the help of state 
provisions.

“I don’t think that African 

American people who are given a 
helping hand to get to university 
are stupid or have a low IQ,” 
Bindel said. “I think that they’re 
just socially disadvantaged.”

Bindel’s statement was met 

with a round of applause and loud 
cheering from several spectators.

LSA freshman Olive Scott 

said she wanted to hear from 
Yiannopoulos since she identifies 
as a feminist, an idea he rejects.

“Mainly I just wanted to hear 

what he had to say and why he 
believes the things he does,” 
Scott said.

The 
event 
also 
featured 

an open mic portion, during 
which attendees were allowed 
to share their views on topics 
discussed during the debate and 
ask Yiannopoulos and Bindel 
questions.

During the open mic portion, 

LSA sophomore Emily Kaufman 
attempted to climb onto the 
stage, 
which 
incited 
some 

audience members to chant GOP 
presidential candidates Donald 
Trump’s 
name 
repeatedly. 

Flyers for a University chapter 
of Students for Trump were on 
many of the seats in the League 
preceding the event.

Kaufman said she climbed on 

the stage to directly challenge 
Yiannopoulos.

After the event, Swogger said 

while the things both figures 
said were controversial, he hoped 
students realized it was all in 
good fun.

“They’re mainly just screwing 

around; 
they’re 
mainly 
just 

comedians,” he said. “They love 
making people laugh, they love 
making each other laugh and 
they don’t take themselves too 
seriously.”

U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) greets supporters at a rally in Grand Rapids on Tuesday evening. 

student loans,” Rubio said. 
“Current leaders don’t care 
about our debt. They just care 
about getting reelected.”

Along with helping students, 

Rubio discussed his plan to 
enhance the United States 
Department 
of 
Veterans 

Affairs, citing a recent misstep 
with the suicide hotline of 
the department that allowed 
calls to go to voicemail or 
otherwise not be responded 
to immediately. Moving to the 
broader topic of the military, he 
also touched on his plan to end a 
deal the Obama administration 
made with Iran, which reduces 
sanctions on the country in 
exchange for an agreement 
from Iran to severely restrict 
its nuclear program.

Also on the subject of the 

military, Rubio garnered a 
response from the crowd when 
he expressed dissatisfaction 
regarding the potential closure 
of Guantánamo Bay, a military 
prison known for its conduction 
of 
unethical 
interrogations, 

and his plans to start a real war 
on terror.

“When I am president, it 

will be my number one priority 
to rebuild the U.S. military,” 
Rubio said. “We aren’t going 
to have a fake war on terror. 
When I am president, we are 
going to have a real war. We are 
going to find them and we are 
going to destroy them with the 
best military in the world.”

Rubio, who is polling in third 

nationally with 16.4 percent, 
according to an aggregate of 
polls from RealClear Politics, 
has yet to win a Republican 
primary. His closest finish was 
a slight lead over Sen. Ted Cruz 
(R–Tex.) in the South Carolina 
primary this weekend to obtain 
second place behind Donald 
Trump.

However, 
Rubio 
said 
he 

remained confident about his 
chances in the election.

“This election is so much 

more, because after eight years 
of failure, this election will be 
what we want it to be for the 
21st century,” he said.

While 
Rubio 
was 

campaigning 
in 
Michigan, 

Nevada’s Republican caucus 
was called for frontrunner 
Donald Trump. The win places 
more pressure on Rubio, as 
well as Cruz, to perform well 
in later primary states such as 
Michigan.

During his speech, Rubio 

referred to Trump indirectly, 
saying he wasn’t asking his 
supporters to let the nation 
be divided by the presidential 
results.

“I will never ask you to be 

angry in order to win. If you 
elect me I will be president for 
all Americans, even the people 
that don’t like me or say nasty 
things about me on Twitter,” 
he said. “Because if you want 
to be president of the USA 
you have to love the American 
people, even the ones who don’t 
love you back.”

Rubio ended the rally by 

recounting his family’s history, 
which he said is the reason he 
is running for president. The 
son of two immigrants who he 
said worked their entire lives 
but were able to buy their own 
house and raise a family of four, 
Rubio said if elected he aims to 
protect the American dream.

“We owe everything to the 

Americans before us. Each 
generation left their children 
better off than themselves,” 
Rubio said. “Now the moment 
has arised for our generation 
to do our part … If you vote for 
me, we will leave our children 
with the greatest nation in the 
history of mankind.”

John Dunn sent out a public letter 
to the campus community Sunday 
noting the need for reform.

“We need to make adjustments 

in our own procedures to respond 
to extraordinary circumstances,” 
he wrote. “Last night’s incident 
clearly was one.”

WMU senior Austin Wines, a 

residential adviser and student 
organizer, put together an online 
petition the night of the shootings 
calling for improvements to the 
system. The petition garnered 
about 1,500 signatures in a day.

In an interview, Wines said 

the petition focuses on the 
emergency alert system as an 
obtainable goal, aiming to match 
the significant importance of 
alerts with system improvements 
to increase campus safety and 
timeliness of alerts.

“Such a large shooting gaining 

national attention shines a light 
on this issue people are now 
taking seriously,” he said. 

The University of Michigan’s 

Division of Public Safety and 
Security alert system differs 
from WMU in that it alerts the 
campus community to possible 
threats both on and off University 
property through e-mails, tweets, 

texts to registered devices and 
messages on the DPSS website 
and the UM digital gateway. 
According to DPSS spokesperson 
Diane Brown, DPSS filters threats 
before sending out an alert, 
with help from Ann Arbor city 
police help in determining the 
imminence of incidents.

“We work quite collaboratively 

with the city police as well as the 
county sheriff,” she wrote in an 
e-mail interview. “To determine 
whether or not to issue an alert 
for an incident not occurring 
on campus, we would analyze 
whether we perceive there is a 
threat to our campus community.”

Wines 
emphasized 
that 

though he was disappointed in 
the handling of the situation 
at WMU, he and other student 
leaders are focused on forward-
thinking reform.

“We’re going to be taking 

a hard look at what we can do 
now in the 21st century to reflect 
the type of campus students 
are calling for,” he said. “We 
appreciate the cooperation of a lot 
of different forces on campus to 
address this issue.” 

After holding a campus town 

hall, Dunn organized a campus life 
committee tasked with updating 
the emergency alert system that 
includes former members of the 
National Guard, a former county 

sheriff and student leaders. WMU 
spokeswoman Cheryl Roland said 
the administration is attentive 
to student concerns and looks 
forward to dialogue.

“As a university, we need 

to do better on this front,” she 
said. “We have a good system 
in place for alerting people to 
campus emergencies, and we 
probably need to formalize a 
system in which in extraordinary 
circumstances we can reach out 
to the community more quickly 
without setting up a pattern of 
too many warnings that might 
jeopardize the way people view 
them.”

emergency; and unless it applies 
to all substances, not just a 
narrow subset,” the resolution 
states. “The Medical Amnesty 
Policy desperately needed is 
one that provides complete 
protection for students of all 
ages.”

The vote resulted in a 26-0 

vote with one abstention, which 
barely qualified as a quorum 
for the body. LSA senior Noah 
Betman, speaker of the assembly, 
said if 24 representatives or less 
were present during the vote it 
could not have been held, and 
the resolution could not have 
been passed.

Attendance 
has 
been 
a 

recurring issue throughout the 
year. During the meeting, three 
representatives were recalled 
based on the premise that they 
were absent for more than the 
allotted number of absences 
without justification.

During 
his 
representative 

report, 
LSA 
junior 
David 

Schafer asked body members to 
look over the the survey, which 
he said has been reviewed by 
University 
researchers 
and 

officials. The survey, a series 
of questions regarding student 
awareness of mental health 
information and resources, is 
meant to gauge whether there 
is a need to improve the general 
mental health climate for faculty 
and students.

Schafer said he and the 

co-authors of the survey, LSA 
junior Yumi Taguchi and LSA 
senior Anna Chen, met with the 
Institutional Review Board in 
order to ensure the questions 
were not biased.

“We are doing this with a 

randomized sample, and hope to 
send this (survey) out by the end 
of March,” Schafer said. “We 
aim to analyze the data in April 
and throughout the rest of the 
summer, and come back in the 
fall with some pretty concrete 
initiatives for the 2016-2017 
academic year.”

Among 
the 
resolutions 

brought to the table were to 
add the 24-hour phone line of 
the 
University’s 
Counseling 

and Psychological Services to 
the back of student Mcards, 
and to fund the production of a 
video for the Prescription Drug 
Misuse Campaign.

The CAPS resolution aimed 

to have the number printed 
on Mcards starting with the 
class of 2020, with the intent 
of 
decreasing 
the 
stigma 

associated with mental illness.

“Everyone knows there’s a 

mental health crisis on campus,” 
said 
LSA 
senior 
Allison 

Williams, one of the resolution’s 
authors. “The goal for this 
resolution is to decrease the 
stigma that is associated with 
mental illness on campus, so 
many people feel uncomfortable 
going to CAPS who may need to 
can get the help they need.”

Williams added that printing 

the number on the back of 
Mcards would be a symbolic 

gesture to show students that 
the 
University 
cares 
about 

mental health issues.

Public Policy junior Jacob 

Pearlman, CSG student legal 
counsel, said he admired the 
presence of the resolution and 
thought it was a much needed 
resource.

In speaking to the second 

resolution, Schafer, a co-author, 
said it was part of the ongoing 
prescription 
drug 
misuse 

campaign. 
Beginning 
last 

semester, the body has been 
planning a week-long event to 
raise awareness in students on 
how academic pressure impacts 
drug abuse and what the effects 
of that abuse are particularly on 
college campuses.

The campaign was inspired in 

part by the death of University 
alum Josh Levine, who passed 
away from a drug overdose 
after 
mixing 
adderall 
with 

alcohol at a party. If approved, 
the resolution would allocate 
$900 to fund the production 
of a promotional video for the 
campaign.

Schafer said he believes the 

video will be a helpful resource 
for both current and future 
students.

“All 
those 
behind 
the 

campaign, myself included, hope 
that this video will be utilized 
by future student groups and 
orgs on campus,” Schafer said. 
“I hope this will last longer than 
than the campaign, and have a 
lasting effect that educates and 
protects students.”

Support Families for Flint Act

FOFA would appropriate money toward 

four focus areas: repairing and replacing water 
service lines, servicing the needs of family 
and communities affected by lead exposure, 
expanding economic development (especially 
for the youth of Flint) and health monitoring 
provided by the new Center for Excellence 
on Lead Exposure. Most importantly, the bill 
requires the replacement of old pipes and the 
inspection of new water pipes to ensure that 
Flint residents can once again obtain clean tap 
water in their homes.

For infrastructure repairs deemed necessary 

by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
the city of Flint would receive $770 million 
in funds. To help provide services to families 
and children exposed to lead in Flint, the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services 
would receive $270 million in funding, the U.S. 
Department of Education would receive $180 
million, the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development would receive $10 million 
and the U.S. Department of Justice would 
receive $10 million. For economic development, 
the U.S. Department of Labor would receive 
$40 million and the U.S. Department of 
Commerce would receive $25 million. Finally, 
to monitor ongoing health of residents in Flint, 
the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services would also recieve $200 million to 
create a Center of Excellence on Lead Exposure 
in Flint.

Another crucial aspect of Kildee’s legislation 

is that it would require the Michigan state 
government to match every federal grant dollar 
Flint receives. In this way, Michigan’s state 
government and the federal government take 
equal financial responsibility for resolving the 
crisis in Flint. The total amount that would be 
appropriated, roughly $765 million (about $1.5 
billion with Michigan’s matched funds), would 
be split roughly equally between infrastructure 
fixes and mitigating the consequences of the 
crisis.

In addition to FOFA, other legislation has 

been introduced that would also help Flint. 
Recently, Michigan Sens. Debbie Stabenow (D) 
and Gary Peters (D) introduced provisions into 
a bipartisan energy bill that designates certain 
funds toward Flint. In addition, Gov. Rick 

Snyder (R) recently signed a $28 million aid bill 
for Flint, one of many allocating state resources 
to Flint.

The Flint water crisis also highlighted 

the need for legislation to better monitor 
water contamination nationwide. On Feb. 
10, the U.S. House passed the Safe Drinking 
Water Act Improved Compliance Awareness 
Act, which is an ammendment that Kildee 
supported to strengthen regulations on the 
U.S. 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency’s 

notification of communities in instances of 
water contamination. The intent of the bill is 
to inform the public in crises similar to Flint’s, 
so the muddled and tragic mishandling of 
Flint’s situation can be avoided in the future. 
Although these are small steps in the right 
direction, FOFA, as of now, is the most effective 
legislation to deal with this crisis and it must be 
passed immediately.

Kildee said in a press release that he was 

pleased that the aforementioned amendments 
to the Safe Drinking Water Act passed, and that 
continued legislation is on the table. Ultimately, 
though, Kildee said he “hope(s) it is only a first 
step in addressing this crisis.”

The government has an obligation to protect 

the many citizens who have been effectively 
poisoned by neglect and misinformation, and 
Kildee’s bill is a positive step toward fulfilling 
this obligation.

Flint must not be just a talking point for 

politicians and presidential hopefuls. It is 
crucial 
to 
provide 
continued, 
consistent 

attention to the needs of Flint residents. The 
health of thousands of people is at stake, not 
simply political capital for the campaign 
season. Bringing justice and aid to the people 
of Flint, as Kildee proposes in the FOFA bill, 
and as other legislation is working to do, is a 
foundational step in the right direction. FOFA 
provides a substantial amount of financial aid 
to Flint and to its community agencies with 
specific goals and means to ensure the targets 
are being met. Congress should act quickly and 
vote yes on this bill. The federal government, 
as well as Michigan’s state government, is 
accountable to the needs of its citizens — Flint 
should be no exception. 

Classes on class

On the very first day of my intro-

ductory political science class, the 
professor posed a question to the 
packed 
lecture 

hall, 
“Is 
the 

American Dream 
attainable 
for 

everyone?”

She instructed 

us to discuss our 
answers 
with 

those around us 
before 
sharing 

with the class. 
Immediately, the 
room 
erupted 

with 
excited 

chatter as hands shot sporadically 
into the air.

“I think the American Dream is 

attainable for everyone,” one kid 
replied. “Because if you work hard 
enough, you can achieve success.”

I watched incredulously as the 

other students nodded in agreement, 
my head swimming with counterar-
guments. What if your school district 
is underfunded? What if you live in a 
neighborhood where you constantly 
fear for your safety? What if you 
have to work during high school to 
help your family make ends meet?

As the conversation adhered to 

this theme for the remainder of the 
90-minute lecture, I felt completely 
and utterly alone in my objections. I 
could not comprehend why my class-
mates did not take into account the 
potential roadblocks people could 
face while pursuing an education 
or a career — unless, of course, they 
have never encountered those road-
blocks themselves.

At the University, I have found 

that this is usually the case. Most 
students here come from dispropor-
tionately privileged backgrounds; 
they attended exceptional schools 
and lived in safe, affluent neighbor-
hoods — and there is absolutely noth-
ing wrong with that. However, this 
undeniably 
advantaged 
upbring-

ing has the tendency to serve as a 

partition, sheltering those who live 
behind it from the realities of the 
world around them. Some of these 
kids are so engrossed in their fortu-
nate lifestyles they forget that they 
rank among the numbered few who 
can actually afford to have them.

For students hailing from more 

modest backgrounds, these divi-
sions can be painfully obvious, and 
pervade every aspect of their col-
lege experience. Some consider their 
socioeconomic status to be a pivotal 
component of their identity, though 
the inconspicuous nature of it means 
their peers usually do not detect any 
difference between themselves and 
their less affluent constituents, as 
it is assumed that most college stu-
dents are relatively well-off.

I understand the option of blend-

ing in is a privilege that most margin-
alized people cannot claim to have, 
and I recognize it as such. However, 
when an aspect of one’s identity slips 
so easily under the radar, it can both 
isolate and alienate them from their 
peers.

As far as I can tell, there is no 

open dialogue on campus that 
addresses socioeconomic discrep-
ancies, and because the issue is not 
always observable, most people do 
not consider it compelling enough 

to explore. Popular political science 
or economics courses tend to brush 
over the subject in favor of general-
izing concepts to make them more 
digestible — which would be fine if 
there were a breadth of classes that 
delved deeper into it. Though there 
are a few here and there that analyze 
the implications of class structure, 
unless you are searching the course 
guide with very specific results in 
mind, most of these courses are only 
discovered through word of mouth.

Furthermore, while the Univer-

sity currently has a Race and Eth-
nicity requirement that focuses 
on “comparisons of discrimina-
tion based on race, ethnicity, reli-
gion, social class, or gender” there 
are only a handful of courses that 
emphasize the role of class in their 
curricula. 
While 
these 
cours-

es don’t necessarily need to be 
required with the same stringen-
cy as Race and Ethnicity courses, 
increasing the availability of these 
classes 
and 
highlighting 
their 

importance in a comprehensive, 
interdisciplinary education will 
engage students more often in con-
versations pertaining to socioeco-
nomic status.

For some people, the “Ameri-

can Dream” is a straight shot to 
success. However, there is merit 
in realizing the conditions that 
facilitate this success do not apply 
to everyone. That day in lecture, 
I learned that not everyone is as 
acutely aware of this phenomenon 
as I am, and, frankly, it alarmed me. 
College students, particularly those 
at prestigious universities, wield 
an influence that a select few can 
claim: They will undoubtedly play 
a major role in shaping the future 
of society. Raising awareness about 
the myriad identities and back-
grounds that make up this society 
is something we cannot neglect.

When you think of Syrians, think of Anne Frank
I

f you are a Jewish woman, 
like myself, you are required, 
by some unspoken rule, to 

read two books 
around 
the 

time of your bat 
mitzvah: 
“The 

Diary of a Young 
Girl” 
by 
Anne 

Frank and “Are You There God? It’s 
me, Margaret” by Judy Blume.

Unlike stories of survival such 

as Elie Wiesel’s “Night” or fictions 
such as Markus Zusak’s “The Book 
Thief,” Anne Frank’s diary is not 
a Holocaust story. Frank’s story 
is actually much more similar to 
Blume’s “Margaret” than it is to 
“The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas.” 
Like Margaret, Anne Frank writes 
about her future and boys and frets 
over puberty. Anne Frank’s diary is 
almost more tragic than stories of 
death camps and torturous Nazis 
because it is relatable. Anne Frank 
was a girl trying to grow and learn 
the way all young women should, 
but her story was cut short. When I 
first read her diary, I was struck by 
how much I related to Frank and her 
desire to experience a first kiss on the 
lips. For me, it would not come for two 
more years, and for her, it would not 
come at all.

You may not know that Anne 

Frank’s father, Otto, had tried to get 
an American visa for his whole family 
to immigrate to the United States. As 
The Washington Post so chillingly put 
it, “Anne Frank could be a 77-year-old 
woman living in Boston today.” I read 
this line as tears well up in my eyes. 
I feel an intense sadness. I am sad 
because I, as a 13-year-old girl, like so 
many other 13-year-olds, Jewish or 
not, feel a strong connection to Anne 
Frank.

This is not the only reason I am 

sad. I am sad that Anne Frank never 
made it to the United States, because 
there are hundreds of thousands 
of young girls out there now, both 
Syrian and otherwise, who may 
never make it to the United States. 
The United States government could 
not have known that Anne Frank was 
being taken to an early death in the 
Bergen-Belson concentration camp 
in Germany. But today is different. 

Today, with 20-20 hindsight, the 
United States can save young girls, 
like Frank, from death by a brutal, 
racist government.

You may, like many others, fear 

that taking in Syrian refugees is 
taking in potential terrorists. In 
the 1940s, Jews were also seen as 
a threat to the United States. They 
were viewed as dirty communists 
trying to corrupt a struggling 
capitalist economy. The United 

States currently plans to let 10,000 
Syrian refugees in over the next 
year. It is not clear how many Jewish 
refugees the United States took 
in during the World War II era. 
However, one thing is clear: Jewish 
people were not often welcomed. 
Many were turned away because 
the United States government feared 
they were spies for the Germans 
or radical anarchists. There are 
large collections online of photos 
of Jewish refugees on boats being 
turned away from the United States 
and Cuba. The Jewish refugees who 
did not make it to the U.S., Canada 
or Palestine faced an almost certain 
death at the hands of the Nazis.

While the situation in Syria 

does not involve gas chambers and 
giant crematoriums, it involves 
other horrors. Syrian refugees face 
displacement 
and 
threats 
from 

their own government, much like 
the Jews did in Europe. The truth 
is, Anne Frank did not die from 
a gunshot or a gas chamber, she 
died from typhus alongside her 
younger sister. Her mother died of 
starvation. Today Syrian refugees in 
camps around the world face similar 
problems: food shortages, diseases 
and extremely low quality of life. 
If stories of Jews in the Holocaust 
break your heart, then so will stories 
of Syrian refugees.

When you think of Syrians, rather 

than picture a threatening man 
with a gun, picture a young woman. 
Picture an Anne Frank. We need 
to give Syrian refugees the kind of 
chance we never gave Jews.

Over the last few months, the events that led to the Flint 

water crisis have come to light. The need for legislation to 
deal with its aftermath and to prevent similar disasters from 
becoming commonplace nationwide is urgent. On Feb. 4, 2016, 
Congressman Dan Kildee (D–Flint) introduced an essential bill 
called the Families of Flint Act. This bill is an important step in 
the process of helping Flint get back on its feet and supporting 
those most affected by the crisis.


‘Witch’ is terrifying

By JACOB RICH

Senior Arts Editor

A24 is quietly killing it. Do peo-

ple realize how many of the great-
est films of the 
2010’s this New 
York-based 
distribution 
company 
has 

financed? None 
of their films 
make an enor-
mous 
amount 

of money — the 
few that have done huge numbers 
include “Ex Machina,” my favor-
ite film of 2015, and the critically 
acclaimed Amy Winehouse doc 
“Amy” — but almost all of them are 
innovative and excellent. You have 
them to thank for “The Spectacu-
lar Now,” “Obvious Child,” “Under 
the Skin,” “The End of the Tour” 
and “Room.”

And now we have “The Witch,” 

a tiny-budget period horror film 
with a brand-new writer/director 
attached (Robert Eggers). Stuck 
somewhere between “The Shin-
ing” and “Evil Dead,” this is a bru-
tal, tension-filled exploration of 
Christian guilt so uncomfortable 
and disturbing that it made two 
couples sitting in front of me get up 
and exit the theater 10 minutes in. I 
didn’t blame them for leaving. This 
is a tremendous film that continues 
A24’s streak of high quality releas-
es, but it’s not for everyone.

“The Witch” is as much about 

a time and a place as it is about a 
situation. The film takes us back to 
primitive America, where surviv-
ing each winter was not a guaran-
tee. Today, we dull our fear of death 
with science and comfort, but the 
harsh wilderness of 17th century 
New England lacked both of those 
luxuries. Instead, the God-fearing 
puritans relied on devout Christi-
anity to make sense of their harsh 
existence. In their world, heaven 
and hell are unquestionably real, 
as are evils that lurk in the woods.

In an inversion of the classic 

“don’t show the monster until the 
end” Spielberg routine, we see the 
witch right away. We’re talking 
classic witch in the woods here 
— this is a gross, wrinkly baby-
devouring witch. She’s not mis-
understood. She’s a fucking evil 
witch, and she’s scary and ugly and 
hangs with the devil. Her purpose? 
To torture a family of excommu-
nicated Christians, struggling to 
make ends meet on a thatched-roof 
farm.

The heart of the film’s dread is a 

youthful fear embodied in some of 
the best performances by children 
I’ve ever seen in a film. Newcom-
ers Anya Taylor-Joy and Harvey 
Scrimshaw bring us back to that 
primal emotional experience we 
had after lying to our mothers or 
stealing an extra cookie after din-
ner — that feeling, lingering for just 
a few minutes, that our dishonesty 

might make us burn in hell for-
ever. As the family descends into 
religious hysteria, we see the terri-
fying implications of how the dog-
matic belief of the parents impacts 
their children.

The power of these scenes 

would not be as effective were it 
not for Eggers’s strict adherence 
to period social customs and man-
ners of speech. Even more impres-
sive is the actors’s delivery of said 
speech, so believable that the dia-
logue maintains a strict separation 
from our contemporary reality, but 
so emotional that we can’t help but 
empathize with the family’s horri-
fying plight.

While it does drag around its 

midpoint, “The Witch” quickly 
maintains pace as slow-burn sym-
phony of familial tension that ends 
in an electrifying coda. Adhering 
to the formalist school of Bergman 
and Kubrick, Eggers and his edi-
tor (newcomer Louise Ford) have 
shaped a thriller that is structur-
ally compelling and nuanced.

It’s wonderful to see so much 

new, hungry talent getting the 
platform they deserve. Films like 
“The Witch” shouldn’t exist, finan-
cially speaking. They’re heavily 
niche products that don’t make a 
lot of money. But thanks to mid-
tier distributors like A24, cinema 
can once again exist between the 
blockbuster and the no-budget 
indie. We need more movies like 
“The Witch.”

‘Zootopia’ showcased

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

Move over, New York City; the 

trendiest urban metropolis is now 
none other than “Zootopia,” Dis-
ney’s latest animated brainchild. 
An urban city created by ani-
mals for animals only, “Zootopia” 
marks the largest animated world 
the studio has created to date, with 
double the number of digital mod-
els used in “Big Hero 6.” Matthias 
Lechner, the film’s Art Director 
of Environments spoke about the 
world-building process on Thurs-
day, Feb. 18 on campus in a lecture 
sponsored by the Michigan Ani-
mation Club.

Lechner emphasized that the 

“city should be a character itself:” 
it should feel imaginative, but still 
be grounded in believability — this 
is a modern city, after all. To begin 
the design process, Lechner’s team 
mentally walks through a typical 
city experience from the eyes of an 
animal.

The research started by looking 

into organic architecture shapes, 
particularly the work of Sagrada 
Familia architect Antoni Gaudi. 
The shapes of buildings and city 
planning are informed by ani-
mal behavior and habitats. Zoo-
topia has a city center with outer 
districts representing different 
artificially-created climate zones: 
Bunny Burrow, a hilly, rural coun-
tryside with kid cubbyholes in 
houses for the constantly growing 
bunny families; Sahara Square, a 
slick desert canyon with an active 
nightlife to match its nocturnal 
lifestyle; Tundratown, an icy locale 
with Russian-inspired architec-
ture; Little Rodentia, a model town 

scaled to the size of a mouse and 
the Rainforest District, a towering 
tropical borough. Because animals 
love nature, buildings are organi-
cally integrated into the backdrop.

Lechner believes that “a model 

is successful if ‘life’ is felt, but the 
audience doesn’t really know why.” 
He stressed the importance of cre-
ating a backstory for every single 
detail about the city and how it 
came to be.

To recreate the feel of a city’s 

ever-progressing history, build-
ings showcase different eras of 
architecture while sprinklers arti-
ficially create the rainforest dis-
tricts’ constant showers. The city 
infrastructure contains tall metal 
pipes disguised as plant roots, 
and a plethora of car options fit 
every animal shape and size. The 
team also created a subway map 
connecting the different districts, 
and contemporary products, bill-
boards and advertisements target-
ing specific animal needs peek out 
behind — details seemingly minor, 
but essential enough in building a 
fully fleshed out world that signage 
design merited its own job title. 
Even the flags in Little Rodentia 
are stiffer because they require 
smaller pieces of cloth. This metic-
ulous attention to detail is what 
makes the world of Zootopia burst 
with vibrancy.

Lechner chuckled when a stu-

dent asked about “Easter Eggs” 
— hidden references to other Dis-
ney animated pictures — scattered 
throughout the movie, saying that 
as a parent of a young child, he feels 
confident that “Zootopia” contains 
a wealth of little background sto-
ries to withstand repeat viewings. 
One such instance to watch out for 

is a calendar featuring “Big Hero 
6” ’s San Fransokyo in the police 
chief’s office.

However, it’s important to note 

that environment design is not 
an isolated process. Designers 
and screenwriters work closely 
together at the beginning of the 
filmmaking process, meeting in 
collaborative meetings at least 
every six weeks for critiques so 
that the storyline and animation 
can build off each other and grow 
in the same direction. Though 
Lechner estimated 80 percent 
of designs didn’t make it to the 
final movie, his team can tweak 
elements to fit new storylines. 
For example, a scene featuring 
a Bunny Burrow house was cut, 
but the house design was adapted 
to become the train station in the 
final version of the film.

For every shot, the art direc-

tor oversees sketch creation, 
which the modeling department 
digitally arranges. Next, the looks 
department, supervised by the 
production director, takes these 
basic shapes and adds textures, 
surface colors, and other artifi-
cially created details. The opti-
mization team uses a program to 
bounce light off shapes to further 
render color and detail. The pro-
cess for each scene takes about 
a month and a half, though the 
teams do work on multiple scenes 
concurrently.

A delightfully bumbling tale 

of talking, two-footed animals 
needs an environment with the 
zeal to match. With its large scale 
and lovingly crafted details, “Zoo-
topia” delivers.

“Zootopia” will be released on 

March 4, 2016.

Baroque quartet

By DAYTON HARE

Daily Arts Writer

Music making is, and always 

has been, a communal activity. 
Though we lack an abundance of 
concrete docu-
mentation, 
it 

is likely that 
the very earli-
est instances of 
music making 
involved com-
munities 
of 

people coming 
together to sing 
and play early 
percussion 
instruments. 
Over 
time 
these 
gatherings 

developed in complexity and rit-
ualistic practices — both social 
and spiritual — sprang up around 
them, many of which still exist 
in some form today. However, 
in many tradition music mak-
ing also began to become more 
grandiose, slowly becoming dis-
connected with its communal 
roots. This is arguably the case 
with the European tradition of 
classical music, as is particularly 
evident in the advent of large 
symphonic orchestras and the 
‘opera-as-spectacle’ culture that 
has developed over the last sev-
eral centuries.

Despite all this, the social 

nature of music making is still 
very evident in specific areas, 
notably that of chamber music. 
It is often chamber musicians, 
rather than large ensembles, 
who can be found participating 
in outreach events and com-
munity activities (a fact which, 
granted, has as much to do with 
organizational 
challenges 
as 

ensemble ethos), but chamber 
music’s social nature is perhaps 
most obvious in the closeness of 
the performers.

In the early history of cham-

ber music, often it was played by 
a group of friends for personal 
enjoyment, and in today’s profes-
sional world this is still the case 
for many performers. Ensemble 
Nevermind, the group of friends 
who will be bringing their music 
to Ann Arbor on Wednesday 
evening, is no exception.

“I used to study the modern 

flute for pedagogie, and Baroque 
flute,” Anna Besson, who is the 
flutist of Ensemble Nevermind, 
said in an interview with The 
Michigan Daily. “And Robin, 
the gamba player, and Jean, 

the harpsichord player, used to 
study the viola da gamba and 
harpsichord because it’s really 
[the] early music department.”

Besson went on to explain the 

origins of Ensemble Nevermind 
in more detail, and how the play-
ers metas peers at conservatory.

“So we basically met at Con-

servatoire supérieur de Paris 
… except Louis, we all used to 
study there. We started to play 
together in another ensemble, 
with singers, and finally we just 
found out that it worked very 
well, the four of us,” Besson said. 
“We used to get all together for 
chamber music or for our exami-
nations, for example … we used 
to share our friendship just to 
participate [in] each examina-
tion. And so we decided, because 
we were close friends, to go 
ahead after our studies and start 
something together.”

The four founders of Ensem-

ble Nevermind — Besson, Louis 
Creac’h, Robin Pharo and Jean 
Rondeau — brought the group 
into 
existence 
about 
three 

years ago, creating a perfor-
mance group which special-
izes in chamber music from the 
Baroque period (c. 1600-1750).

“For concerts, of course, it’s 

a quartet, so we can play music 
from, I would say, end of 17th 
century … until, I would say the 
end of [the] 18th century, because 
after this period of course harp-
sichord and viola da gamba 
disappear from orchestras and 
music chambers, because of the 
Revolution.”

In addition to their profes-

sional specialization in Baroque 
and other early music, the 
youthful friends of Ensemble 
Nevermind enjoy playing other 
genres together for recreation.

“For fun, we like to play a lot 

of music, so we improvise a lot 
when rehearsing,” Besson said. 
“It can be like contemporary 
music, or jazz music, or tradi-
tional music, it depends. It helps 
… to relax also.”

Besson also spoke about the 

ensemble’s upcoming perfor-
mance in Ann Arbor this week, 
saying the program to be pre-
sented will largely be for quartet

“In Baroque music ensembles 

you always have a trio, even 
if there are four musicians, 
because two of them are playing 
basso continuo, so they play the 
same part,” Besson said. “And 
we’ve decided to really play 

music for quartet, which means 
that viola da gamba and harpsi-
chord have two separate parts.”

Besson also described some 

of the specific pieces Ensemble 
Nevermind will be performing, 
detailing her history with them 
and talking about the compos-
ers.

“When we decided to read 

the “Paris Quartet,” by [Georg 
Philipp] Telemann, which are 
very [sic] written for quartet, it 
was like really what we wanted 
to do,” Besson said. “Because 
we perform like a string quar-
tet, in fact — there is no leader, 
it is ensemble, we just act like 
if we’re a string quartet. With 
a first violin, second violin, alto 
— ah well, viola — and cello, it’s 
really the same.”

Ensemble Nevermind’s CD of 

Quentin and Guillemain, among 
other composers, will be coming 
out on the 22nd of March, the 
first release of the group.

“[François] 
Couperin 
[is] 

the last composer we will play, 
because sometimes you have the 
continuo with harpsichord and 
viola da gamba, but sometimes 
the gamba also plays a soloist 
part,” Besson said. “So some-
times it’s a trio, sometimes it’s a 
quartet, so this is very interest-
ing, it’s in between.”

Besson also explained some 

of the philosophical reasons 
behind what Ensemble Nev-
ermind does, and the goals of 
the group in terms of societal 
impact.

“Usually people always ask 

‘Why ‘Nevermind?’ ’ And in a 
way — yes we are French, but it 
doesn’t matter, in the sense that 
music belongs to everybody,” 
Besson said. “It doesn’t belong to 
people from 60 years-old, as we 
usually see in the concert hall, 
at least in France. And (the age 
discrepancy) is a pity, because 
we want to touch everybody, and 
especially young people.”

Besson concluded on an opti-

mistic tone, conveying her hope 
that through Ensemble Never-
mind’s music they might change 
the way early music is perceived.

“So maybe, with the fact that 

we have taken some funny pic-
tures, and some videos that 
we’re not wearing black clothes 
— we just want to change a bit 
this vision of Baroque music 
… music belongs to everybody. 
There is not an age to listen to 
Baroque or classical music.”

KANYE WEEK
Why I don’t love ’Ye

By KEN SELANDER

Daily Arts Writer

I have a very dirty secret that 

will make most people with a 
musical inclination gasp: I’ve never 
listened to much Kanye. As terrible 
as this might sound, let me reflect 
on how I caught myself commit-
ting such an unspeakable hip-hop 
sin.

You see, there’s a lot of music out 

there in the world — a whole lot. If 
you want to bring out some fancier 
words you could say there’s a pleth-
ora, or perhaps a surplus. So much 
that one doesn’t have time to listen 
to all there is. I’ve never listened 
to The College Dropout or 808s & 
Heartbreak. And yes, of course 
I’ve heard singles like “Heart-
less,” “Jesus Walks” and “The New 
Workout Plan” at a party or in a 
friend’s car. But there’s just so 
much of Yeezy’s discography I 
don’t know. 

Are you angry with me? Or 

just disappointed? That’s OK.

Let me bring the discussion to 

a place you might find yourself, 
too. When I browse around Spo-
tify or YouTube and find some 
tune that will keep me feeling 
good while I’m strolling around 
campus, I don’t just listen to it a 
few times and then put it on the 
shelf. I abuse the song. I listen 
until I know all of the words. I 
press play until I dread the song, 
until I can’t enjoy it for the next 
six months because I’m so sick of 
hearing it by the time I’m done 
with it. I’m currently in the mid-
dle of this process with much of 
the Arctic Monkeys discography 
and Born Sinner by J. Cole.

Listening to a song this fre-

quently, or at least in relation to 
all the other music available, is 
taxing and time consuming. One 
artist I simply haven’t focused 
on is Kanye West, but I do have 
some working knowledge of his 
work because hearing his songs 
is inevitable. While it seems he’s 
advanced to a miraculous level 
of media attention since some-

where around the time he inter-
rupted Taylor Swift at the VMAs, 
his music has been on the radio far 
before that. “Gold Digger,” “Flash-
ing Lights” and “N****s in Paris” 
are prime examples of songs I’ve 
heard despite the dense walls of 
the rock I live under.

Being conscious of my gap in 

popular music knowledge, I fig-
ured I’d give Yeezus a play when it 
came out.

All the hype was there. I figured 

it’d prove to be solid ammunition 
for some future casual conversa-
tions. But man, it was harsh on 
the ears. I had to cut my listening 
short somewhere in the middle 
of “Blood on the Leaves.” For all 
I know, “Guilt Trip” “Send It Up” 
and “Bound 2” may be rad tunes, 
but I wasn’t feeling it. I know what 

Kanye was doing, but he did too 
much: Yeezus was too artificially 
artsy for me to take any joy out of 
it. Kanye was simply trying too 
hard, but then again that’s Kanye 
as I understand it.

Yeezus was not my jam. I said it. 

I’ll start bracing myself for the shit 
storm. 

So as bizarre as it sounds, I’ve 

barely listened to any Kanye and 
I despise Yeezus. I’ll listen to The 
Life of Pablo, though I fear it’ll be 
akin to Yeezus, but appearances by 
Kendrick and Chance the Rapper 
sound appealing. Classic Kanye 
records will definitely make their 
way to my playlist in the coming 
months when I get around to it, but 
as a student there’s only so much 
time to listen to music and I simply 
haven’t prioritized Mr. West.

SUMMER EMPLOYMENT

When I asked my 16-year-old 

sister if she wanted to see “Son 
of Saul” last Friday night, she 
expressed a great interest. She 
had never heard of the film, but 
had over-
heard me 
talking 
about 
it 

a 
little, 

so 
she 

knew 
at 

least that 
it 
was 

a 
Holo-

caust 
film. 
I 

thought 
it 
only 

fair 
to 

warn her 
that this film a) was Europe-
an (therefore in subtitles and 
highly character driven) and b) 
takes the viewer into the heart 
of a death camp; there would 
be, in short, some disturbing 
content. She was undeterred.

As we watched the film, 

I repeatedly saw her shaken 
expression, her hands often 
covering her mouth in terror. 
And when we left, she was 
expressionless, 
almost 

catatonic, in her demeanor. 
I never asked her what she 
thought of the film as a 
whole, but I know she found it 
distressing.

I didn’t find the film so 

shocking, 
and 
was 
more 

surprised by how little death I 
actually saw given the setting. 
For almost the entirety of the 
film, the camera never leaves 
the protagonist Saul’s face 
or back as he navigates the 
seemingly labyrinthine halls of 
the death camp. In fact, almost 
everything in the shot other 
than Saul’s face or back remains 
out of focus and distant. We are 
maddeningly aware that there’s 
more happening in the scene, 
but we can’t actually see it — 
like a flicker in the corner of 
the eye, but with the turn of the 
head, the apparition vanishes.

We 
therefore 
experience 

the entirety of the death camp 
through Saul, and there is no 
shortage of horror to be found; 
we are with him when he leans 
against the metal door of the 
gas chamber and hears the 
desperate screams of hundreds, 
only for the noise to suddenly 
cease; we are with him at the 
pits as Jews are led like lambs 
to the slaughter, one by one 
lined up, pushed to the edge 
of the pit and executed with a 
bullet to the head; we are with 
him as he fires the scorching 
ovens.

And yet I was not disturbed, 

nor was I moved by Saul’s lack 
of perspective as he searches 
for a rabbi to provide a proper 
burial for a boy he believes, 
though is probably not, his 
illegitimate son, rather than 
commit himself to the final 
preparations for a prisoner 
uprising. Some might call my 
stoicism inhuman.

I don’t believe I’m inhuman, 

but I have been desensitized. 
I’ve seen many, many Holocaust 
films, and, having been raised 
in a Jewish home and having 
gone to Jewish day school for 
nine years, I have no shortage 
of vivid images of Holocaust-
related material and memory. 
After a while, these images 
and horrors stopped being 
horrifying — they just became 
facts, cold and nonjudgmental.

Of course, “Son of Saul” 

wasn’t made solely for me. But 
I ask myself why I so desire to 
see films like these, films that 
display human suffering in all 
its terror, where there is only 
one possible ending — death 
— and I am rather unmoved by 
it. Indeed, “Son of Saul” seems 
to offer no lessons, no reason 
to exist beyond portraying 
a more personal take on the 
otherwise grander scale that is 
most other Holocaust films — 
human suffering through one 
viewpoint, one angle, rather 
than many.

Is that enough of a reason for 

a film to exist? Is guilt over the 
Holocaust so high that any film 
that explores the subject gets 
an automatic pass for a dearth 
of content? If I want a film that 
depicts mass death, why can’t 
I cut out all Holocaust-related 
material and go see “Deadpool” 
instead? At least then I can 
laugh at the absurdity of it 
all, rather than sitting with 
resignation.

In 
fact, 
I 
did 
go 
see 

“Deadpool,” 17 hours after I 
saw “Son of Saul,” and, to my 
surprise, I found similarities 
in their stories. At their cores, 
both are stories of an individual 
coping with trauma: one seeks 
distraction from the horror of 

his daily life, the other seeks 
full-scale, 
bloody 
revenge 

— both seem to me highly 
irresponsible courses of action. 
And as its cocksure, self-aware 
attitude reiterates over and 
over again, “Deadpool” also 
has no reason to exist. It is 
the product of a moneymaking 
Hollywood machine: no more, 
no less.

But “Deadpool” is escapism 

where “Son of Saul” grounds 
itself in reality, a past reality 
but reality nonetheless. There 
are 
no 
alternate 
timelines 

and no reset buttons for “Son 
of Saul” and the Holocaust 
genre 
as 
a 
whole 
(unless 

you’re “Inglourious Basterds,” 
but 
that’s 
another 
story 

altogether). It is, ultimately, 
just a horrid chapter among the 
other many horrid chapters of a 
long human history.

Perhaps it is guilt that 

drives our fascination with 
the Holocaust (particularly in 
Europe), perhaps it’s a function 
of the “never forget” ideology 
passed 
down 
through 
the 

generations. Perhaps we cling 
to the glimmers of hope and 
escape, as one might do with 
the case of Saul, in an otherwise 
dark 
and 
twisted 
world. 

Or perhaps it’s that human 
suffering is itself fascinating, 
and the Holocaust represents 
the apex of that suffering.

I do not know the answer but 

I do know this: for as much as 
we research it, write about it, 
create films related to/about it, 
the Holocaust is out of our reach 
of understanding. The only 
ones that really understand it 
are those that suffered through 
it, and even they may not have 
come to terms with it. And for 
as many films and stories as 
there are about a hero, a savior, 
a 
do-gooder, 
those 
stories 

comprise a small minority that 
can never hope to relate the 
experience.

I 
think, 
therefore, 
“Son 

of Saul” is the best type of 
Holocaust film, the one that 
says nothing, that seems to 
have no reason to exist. In its 
silence, its frustratingly close 
camera angles, its out of focus 
middle and backgrounds, we 
are forced to accept that the 
Holocaust is beyond us.

The point, then, is not 

necessarily to feel or to relate, 
because we simply cannot feel 
and relate to this chapter of 
history in a way that would 
ever prove satisfactory. The 
point is to go to the theater, to 
submit yourself to more death 
without purpose, to know that 
you could go see “Deadpool” 
instead. 
Sometimes, 
it’s 

acceptable to just watch and be 
present and to know that what 
you’re watching is a Holocaust 
film. In the end, that’s all we 
can really do.

Mellow ‘Life of 
Pause’ easy listen

Wild Nothing’s 

fourth studio album 
is soft and surreal.

By SHIMA SADAGHIYANI

Daily Arts Writer

Imagine looking into a kalei-

doscope — a bright whirlwind 
of color and ambiguous designs, 
always 
trans-

forming 
into 

new 
patterns. 

It’s intense but 
soothing 
and 

the 
undulat-

ing movements 
of 
light 
are 

entrancing; you 
could 
spend 

forever 
with 

one eye pressed against that 
small cylinder. 

Listening to Wild Nothing’s 

new album, Life of Pause, is a 
similar experience. 

With four complete albums 

already behind them, you would 
think Wild Nothing would put 
their years of experimenting 
with hazy vocals and varying 
electronic backgrounds behind 
to settle down for something 
more structured and simple. 
Fortunately, Wild Nothing con-
tinued to explore with albums 
like Empty Estate and Golden 

Haze which set the groundwork 
for (and produced a chromatic, 
subtly psychedelic adventure in) 
Life of Pause.

The album opens with “Reich-

pop” and the soft, Zen-like 
melody of the first few min-
utes transitions smoothly into a 
bright, upbeat tempo that pushes 
the song from something that 
you would use to meditate to 
something that deserves its own 
light show. By the time “I am the 
silent son / I am the only one / 
staying home today” is added to 
the mix, “Reichpop” is perfectly 
layered with nebulous vocals on 
top of a bouncing rhythm on top 
of the serene melody heard indi-
vidually in the beginning of the 
song. It’s five minutes of a beauti-
ful catastrophe, and the fun only 
continues throughout the rest 
of the album. Title track “Life 
of Pause” is a mess of contradic-
tions as the buoyant beat over-
powers the sorrowful “how come 
we were in love?” while “Adore” 
is a compilation of introspective 
guitar chords and haunting piano 
melodies that perfectly capture 
the essence of heartache. 

The songs in Life of Pause sew 

the album together like a patch-
work quilt — the edges meld 
smoothly together but each sec-
tion is different, which is the 
reason why this album is so 
interesting. Each song is its own 
composition. The only elements 

tying the entire album together 
are the muted vocals and ambi-
ent rhythm. The song “Japanese 
Alice” is fast-paced and bewil-
dering in its twirling tempo, 
completely 
contrasting 
the 

creeping and leisurely “Alien.” 
The tracks would have been too 
conflicting to be listened to in 
the same album if not for the 
uniting vocals making each song, 
no matter what the beat, seem 
remote and indefinite. 

And this dissonance in each 

song fits for most of the album 
because Wild Nothing usually 
knows how to push their surreal 
sound without being in your face 
about it. However, the groovy, 
harmonious vibe of songs like 
“To Know You” and “TV Queen” 
falls flat in the two weakest 
tracks of the album, “Lady Blue” 
and “A Woman’s Wisdom.” In 
both songs, the uniformity of 
the vocals and the beat creates a 
dreariness that stands out from 
the rest of the album’s bursting 
vitality. But these are just two 
songs in the entire 11-track album 
and actually help to provide a bit 
of a break from the other dizzying 
compositions.

Overall, Life of Pause is a mind-

blowing dream; a perfect mix of 
gauzy afternoon jams and retro 
tunes taken straight from your 
wildest daydreams and ready for 
you to explore on a day that is just 
a little too monotonous.

Defenseman Martin tries hand at forward

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Cutler Martin stepped off the 

rink after Monday’s practice, 
and judging by the smirk on his 
face, you could get a sense that 
something witty was coming.

Observing Cooper Marody 

speaking to reporters, Martin 
cracked a joke that it was time 
for Marody to join his fellow 
freshmen in collecting all the 
pucks on the ice. Martin took the 
first-year forward’s spot in front 
of reporters, and he just couldn’t 
help himself from tossing one 
more comment Marody’s way.

“This is the spot where real 

forward stars are,” Martin said 
with a grin.

The 
punch 
line? 
The 

sophomore had never played a 
single shift at forward in his life 
until last Friday against Ferris 
State.

This 
season, 
Martin 
has 

played 25 of the Michigan 
hockey team’s 28 games. And 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
the 

matchup with the Bulldogs, he 
has suited up as a defenseman in 
every one of those contests.

But 
now, 
Martin 
is 

transitioning into a different 
role 
for 
the 
Wolverines. 

Michigan coach Red Berenson 
moved Martin into the forward 
slot Friday night, pairing him 
with junior Max Shuart and 
sophomore Niko Porikos on the 
fourth line.

The change may not be 

permanent, 
but 
it 
certainly 

came as a surprise.

Last Monday, Martin walked 

into 
the 
locker 
room 
and 

Berenson pulled him aside to 
tell him that the team needed 
him to add some grit up front. 
Next thing he knew, Martin 
had a white jersey in his stall 
— the same one every forward 
typically wears in practice — 
and his transition process had 

begun.

“I don’t know what the plan 

is,” Martin said. “I don’t know 
if they specifically know exactly 
what they want me to be. If they 
need a forward, I’ll be a forward. 
If they need a D, I’m going to be 
D.”

For Berenson, two factors 

played into the decision. The 
first involved looking to the 
future, and the second related 
to the present. He felt the fourth 
line needed a better fit for this 
campaign, but he also believed 
the team would need something 
more at forward in the coming 
years.

The 
defenseman-to-forward 

conversion process isn’t a foreign 
concept to Berenson, as he did 
the same thing with Wolverine 

alum Scooter Vaughn in 2008.

Vaughn 
made 
his 
debut 

as a forward in the CCHA 
Championship a season after 
spending every prior game of his 
career as a blueliner.

And 
the 

change 
was 

successful, as 
Vaughn closed 
out the final 
two years of 
his 
Michigan 

career 
as 

a 
winger. 

Though 
he 

notched 
just 

six points in his first season as 
a full-fledged forward, Vaughn 
boosted that total to 28 his 
senior year and finished third 
on the team in goals — all while 

leading the Wolverines to the 
NCAA Tournament quarterfinal 
and an NCAA Frozen Four title 
game in those respective years.

Vaughn’s history is evidence 

that 
if 
Martin’s 
switch 
is 

permanent, it 
may take some 
time for the 
sophomore 
to make the 
transition. 
Martin 
immediately 
recognized 
those growing 
pains 
Friday, 

but 
that’s 
not 
to 
say 
the 

experience wasn’t positive.

“Obviously at this level of the 

game, it’s kind of like you react 
to things instinctively,” Martin 

said. “Now, since I had to switch 
positions all of a sudden, I have 
to think about it a little more. 
It was definitely confusing to 
some extent. It was different, 
but it was fun.”

Yet, 
in 
the 
short 
term, 

Berenson 
sees 
aspects 
of 

Martin’s game that could lead to 
an immediate contribution.

“I like his intensity, I like his 

grit,” Berenson said. “And he’s 
got strong hands. When he goes 
in the corner, he goes in like a 
man, not like a boy. I like those 
things about him and I think our 
team needs that. ... The question 
is, are we a better team with this 
lineup? It remains to be seen.”

Even if Martin’s change is 

only temporary, he still views 
time on the offensive side of 

the puck as a valuable learning 
experience. In just one game, 
the new forward has gained a 
fresh perspective on what makes 
playing the position so difficult 
— challenges like protecting the 
puck, moving from the defensive 
zone to the offensive zone and 
simply creating scoring chances 
in general.

With 
that 
new 
outlook, 

Martin is confident that even 
if his time as a winger ends as 
soon as the upcoming series 
against Minnesota, he will be 
able to make his teammates’ 
lives easier.

In his brief stint as a forward 

against Ferris State — he played 
just eight and a half minutes 
by Berenson’s estimation — 
Martin did show some flashes 
of offensive prowess. His line 
strung together some dangerous 
scoring chances, and Martin 
rang one off the crossbar while 
falling to his knees in the second 
period.

Despite 
the 
near-goal, 

though, his teammates still 
don’t think of Martin for flashy 
offensive abilities.

“I think he played well last 

game … but in my mind I still 
think 
he’s 
a 
defenseman,” 

said junior blueliner Michael 
Downing.

But, of course, the player 

who started an interview with 
some self-deprecating humor 
came prepared with a friendly 
rebuttal in his back pocket.

“I think when I come to the 

rink every day, I think I’m a 
defenseman still,” Martin said. 
“It’s going to be really difficult 
to get that instinct out of me. It’s 
always going to be there. I’ve 
spent the last 15 years of my life 
at D. 

“I think if I wind up for a slap 

shot in front of (Downing) and 
I’m on forward, he’s going to get 
out of the way and think I’m a 
forward pretty soon.”

‘M’ credits hot start to chemistry

By SYLVANNA GROSS 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s baseball 

team is not superstitious — or 
at least hasn’t alluded to any 
reservations when talking about 
its recent success. But if the 
Wolverines win the next contest 
against Saint Joseph’s on Friday, 
they’ll be matching their best-
ever start to a season since 2009 
with a 5-0 win streak. 

But the team is trying not to 

dwell on its hot start. 

“We’ve looked ahead without 

making 
it 
something 
our 

players will be focused on,” said 
Michigan coach Erik Bakich. 
“There’s no further than our 
next opponent, and no further 
than today’s training session. 
We’re certainly excited about 
going out to California with the 
team, but we’re not going to 
California today, we’re not going 
to California tomorrow — we’re 
going to California on Thursday, 
and our first game isn’t until 
Friday.”

Still, 
the 
excitement 

surrounding the team is electric 
after 
its 
four-game 
season 

opener 
against 
Canisius 
— 

especially after sophomore left-
hander Oliver Jaskie pitched 
six innings and allowed just 
three hits. He was named Big 
Ten Pitcher of the Week for his 
performance. 

Other highlights of the first 

sweep included the first home 
run of the season by designated 
hitter Harrison Wenson and a 
finish by Carmen Benedetti with 
two strikeouts and a flyout. 

“It feels good,” said senior 

left-hander Evan Hill. “It always 
feels good to win. We’re just 
taking 
the 
momentum 
into 

practice today, and then the next 
day of practice. We’re going to 
keep going forward and take the 
momentum into the weekend 
and continue to win.”

Michigan 
outscored 
the 

Griffins, 27-5, and allowed only 
one earned run for the entire 
weekend. 

The last time the Wolverines 

opened this well, in 2009, they 
finished 9-15 in the Big Ten and 
30-25 overall — which would 
be a disappointment for this 
seasons’ team considering last 
year’s group went 14-10 Big Ten, 
39-25 overall, and finished with 
a Big Ten Tournament title. 

Bakich points to the chemistry 

of the team as the reason for the 
early success. 

“They genuinely care about 

each other and want each other 
to do well,” Bakich said. “The 
team chemistry on this team is 
extremely high, and when you 
have that, you feel fortunate 
because you’re blessed to be 
around a group of guys who 
genuinely want to do well and 
genuinely care for one another 
and care about where the team 
is going. It’s fun to watch from a 
coaching standpoint.” 

The time gap between the 

2016 team and the 2009 team 
is minor compared to the time 
between 2009 and 18 years ago 
when Michigan started 6-0 in 
1991 under Bill Freehan.

Despite 
the 
impressive 

statistics, though, Bakich is 
itching for some adversity. 

“From a coaching standpoint, 

you’re always interested to see 
how the team responds when you 
get that punch in the mouth or 
that kick to the stomach,” Bakich 
said. “We had played with a lead 
for the entire weekend, and 
things went well for us because 
we were playing really well. and 
that was exciting. We’re going to 
want to replicate that as often as 
possible. I think with the high-
character group of kids that 
we have that we’re excited to 
see how they respond to some 
adversity. 

“You know the garbage is 

going to hit the fan at some point 
in this season. So whether it’s 
this weekend or a month from 
now, I’m just excited to see how 
(the team) bonds when things 
aren’t always going our way.” 

But for now, superstitions 

aside, it’s safe to say that 
Michigan is off to what might be 
a historic season.

Michigan can’t tame 

course conditions at 

Puerto Rico Classic

Wolverines’ tropical 

tournament 

produces outings 

to forget 

By ANDREW EHRENBERG 

Daily Sports Writer

In a weekend dominated 

by Southeastern Conference 
opponents, the Michigan men’s 
golf team could not quite keep 
up.

Sunday, the team travelled 

to Rio Grande, Puerto Rico, 
to compete in the annual 
Puerto Rico Classic for the 
14th straight year. All-Big Ten 
golfers Chris O’Neill — who 
finished seven shots over par 
— and Kyle Mueller (plus-9) 
both struggled, which made it 
difficult for the Wolverines to 
climb the leaderboard. O’Neill, 
a senior, had his fourth — and 
last — chance to tee off at the 
Puerto Rico Classic. It was an 
outing to forget. 

With the dryer and faster 

grass that the Michigan team 
is 
used 
to 
practicing 
and 

competing on in the Midwest, 
it struggled to settle in when 
it encountered the unfamiliar 
conditions. 
Teams 
with 

stronger performances, such as 
champion Alabama (minus-25) 
and runner-up Clemson (minus-
16) are used to the warmer and 
more tropical climate. This 
gave them a heavy upper hand 
over the Midwestern teams, 
who are still practicing in a 
below-freezing environment.

Michigan 
coach 
Chris 

Whitten 
was 
disappointed, 

but he understood the team’s 
challenge getting acclimated to 
the atypical Rio Grande course.

“Adjusting to the conditions 

of the course was tough”, 
Whitten said. “It played very 
wet and very slow. Most places 

we play at are the opposite. 
Making adjustments on the fly 
is what we need to be able to 
do.”

Whitten 
emphasized 
that 

in-game adjustments are going 
to be key to the Wolverine’s 
success, especially on courses 
where they are less confident. 

The team’s best performance 

came 
from 
freshman 
Nick 

Carlson – who finished the 
three days with a cumulative 
score of plus-6 – and so the 
Wolverines fell behind quickly 
and failed to adjust, finishing 
with a final team score of plus-
29.

Despite 
struggling 
this 

weekend, Whitten and Carlson 
both remained poised and are 
maintaining ambitious goals.

“Our guys compete to win 

every tournament”, Whitten 
said. “If we play the way we are 
capable of playing, we can make 
it back to the postseason and 
have a chance at the Big Ten 
(Championships).”

Whitten 
remains 
firmly 

convinced of his team’s ability, 
but he recognizes that the 
team has a long road ahead to 
optimize its potential. He and 
his athletes know that making 
on-the-fly adjustments is not 
easy, noting that the team 
has to work hard for their 
opportunities.

Carlson echoed this when 

speaking about his goals. While 
he generally emphasized team-
oriented goals, he also added 
that each shot is an opportunity.

“We have to make every 

move count,” Carlson said. 

With the Desert Mountain 

Intercollegiate tournament in 
Scottsdale, Ariz., coming up on 
March 5, the Wolverines will 
have to adjust to yet another 
unfamiliar climate. But more 
importantly, they are looking 
to start an upward trend as the 
Big Ten Championships in April 
grow nearer.

Wolverines brace for Northwestern

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Before addressing the media 

on 
Tuesday, 
Michigan 
men’s 

basketball coach John Beilein 
lightheartedly 
noted 
that 

with 
spring 

approaching, 
the days have 
been 
getting 

longer.

“You 
know 

we’re getting 11 
hours of daylight 
every day right 
now? You know 
that?” 
Beilein 

said. 
“That’s 

a secret about 
Coach 
Beilein. 

I keep track of 
the sunrise and sunset, because 
growing up in Buffalo, in the long 
winters, you couldn’t wait to have 
that sunshine.”

Outside, the sun may be on the 

rise, but inside of Crisler Center 
— where the Wolverines (9-6 
Big Ten, 19-9 overall) practiced 
Tuesday afternoon in preparation 
for their Wednesday matchup with 
Northwestern — the sun has been 
setting on a season that began with 
unclouded optimism.

Senior 
guard 
Caris 
LeVert 

— who opted to forgo the NBA 
Draft and lead the team in his 
final year — has instead played 
just 11 minutes in 2016 due to a 
lower left leg injury. Senior guard 
Spike Albrecht has joined him 
on the bench after announcing 
in December he would be done 
playing due to his own injuries.

With both of their seniors 

on the bench, the Wolverines’ 
defensive struggles have caught 
up with them during conference 
play. Michigan’s opponents are 
averaging 67 points per game — 
the most opponents have averaged 
against the Wolverines since the 
2007-08 season, Beilein’s first at 
Michigan.

With just three games left on 

the schedule, Beilein said his 
main focus is to emphasize better 

defensive play.

“We still can’t plug the holes 

in our defense right now,” Beilein 
said. “We just cannot do it. And 
we’ve just got to keep working at 
it. We’re going to do some drills 
today — like back to the beginning 
in some things — because we’re 
just having trouble with just the 
idea of guys in the midst of action 
getting into a stance and playing 
really good gap defense or 1-on-1 
defense.”

As a team, Michigan aims to keep 

opponents under 40 percent from 
the field. Lately, the execution has 
faltered. Four of the Wolverines’ 
last six opponents have shot better 
than 50 percent from the field. 
Sunday, Maryland shot 54 percent 
on field-goal attempts, edging the 
Wolverines 86-82 and snapping a 
50-0 mark that Michigan had in 
games in which it scored 80 points 
under Beilein.

“(We need to emphasize) really 

being there,” said junior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. “Helping the 
next guy, making it five against 
the ball as opposed to — it’s been 
basically just 1-on-1. The focus 
going forward is playing better 
team 
defense. 
I 
don’t 
think 

individually we can point guys out 
and say they’re not doing their job, 
we’ve just got to do a better job 

collectively.”

The Wildcats (5-9, 17-10) will 

be coming off an eight-day break 
after losing to Purdue on the road 
on Feb. 14. Northwestern has just 
five conference wins but has stuck 
around in many of its losses and 
even took a then-No. 7 Maryland 
team to overtime a month ago in 
College Park.

In a low point for the Wolverines 

last year, the Wildcats edged them 
in Evanston in a double-overtime 
thriller. 

Northwestern gets most of its 

offensive production from guards 
Tre Demps and Bryant McIntosh, 
who are averaging 14.9 and 14.3 
points, respectively. McIntosh’s 
6.6 assists per game are second 
best in the conference.

“They really are executing 

well,” Beilein said. “I mean, you 
look at all their games, they’ve 
been out of only a couple games. 
… They’re a good basketball team, 
and I wouldn’t doubt if they’re 
right in the middle of the Big Ten 
based on looking at their schedule 
going forward.

LeVert still out: Beilein said 

that he does not plan on LeVert 
playing on Wednesday.

“Do not expect Caris to be able 

to play,” Beilein said. “I just talked 
with him, and he’s not going to be 

able to practice today, he still has 
some discomfort. Going forward, 
just plan on that he’s not going to 
be playing until he’s ready to play 
again.”

The coach said that he will not 

shut down LeVert permanently 
because the senior guard still 
wants to play. Beilein wants 
to give him the opportunity to 
do so in his final season if he’s 
healthy.

Donnal’s future on hold: 

Before the season started, Beilein 
reclassified forward Mark Donnal 
from a redshirt sophomore to 
a true junior. Donnal has been 
Michigan’s best big man this 
year and is coming off a 25-point 
performance at Maryland. Despite 
his stellar play of late, Beilein 
said that any conversation of 
reclassifying him again in order 
to get four years of play out of 
him would not be an immediate 
decision.

“We probably will have that 

(conversation) ongoing,” Beilein 
said. “He’s really doing a great 
job of earning his scholarship 
this year. He’s doing a wonderful 
job of working hard and doing 
everything. But we’ll meet at 
another time because it obviously 
affects our scholarship situation 
in 2017.”

Demps remembers 
double-OT thriller

By JACOB GASE 

Daily Sports Editor

If there’s one easy prediction to 

be made about the Michigan men’s 
basketball team’s matchup with 
Northwestern on Wednesday, it’s 
that there’s no way it can top what 
happened in the two teams’ last 
meeting.

When the Wolverines traveled 

to Evanston on March 3, 2015, 
their season was essentially lost. 
Their two best players, then-junior 
guard Caris LeVert and then-
sophomore guard Derrick Walton 
Jr., were done for the year with 
injuries, and Michigan had just 
come off a brutal 1-6 record in the 
month of February.

Facing the Wildcats — who 

were then 5-11 in the Big Ten and 
had already lost to the Wolverines 
earlier in the season — seemed like 
a chance for Michigan to snap out 
of its funk and start a late-season 
push for the National Invitation 
Tournament. But what happened 
instead was a double-overtime 
thriller from which Northwestern 
escaped with an 82-78 victory, 
and the Wolverines missed out on 
postseason play all together.

As Michigan slides closer 

to 
the 
NCAA 
Tournament 

bubble, it faces another must-
win scenario this season when it 
hosts the struggling Wildcats on 
Wednesday.

To secure a win, Michigan 

will have to hold in check the 
hero of last year’s game: senior 
guard Tre Demps, who pulled 
off one of the most improbable 
feats in recent Big Ten memory: 
sinking not one, not two, but 
three late clutch 3-pointers. The 
first came with four seconds left 
in regulation to send the game to 
overtime, and then Demps struck 
twice in the last 10 seconds of the 
first overtime to erase a six-point 
Michigan lead and force double 
overtime.

The Daily caught up with 

Demps at Big Ten Media Day in 
October to discuss that wild game, 
one of the biggest performances of 
his career to date.

The Michigan Daily: Where 

did that game against Michigan 
last year rank as far as the craziest 
games you’ve been a part of?

Tre Demps: It definitely was 

the craziest. I think what a lot of 
people don’t realize is I was really 
struggling in that game prior to 
what happened at the end, and 
(senior center) Alex Olah was 
carrying us throughout the game. 
I just have to give all the credit to 
my teammates and the coaches, 
who trusted me at the end of the 
game to take those shots.

TMD: After a game like 

that, do you start to feel more 
comfortable with the ball in your 
hands in late-game situations?

TD: Yeah, you know, it’s 

actually something I used to 
practice with my dad all the time, 
taking that big shot. We’d play 
1-on-1 and pretend there was a 
certain amount of time on the 
clock. We practiced that from the 
time I was in elementary school. I 
think it gave me the confidence to 
do it at this stage.

TMD: I heard you talking 

earlier about how your team puts a 
lot of emphasis on practicing late-
game situations. With so many 
close Big Ten games last year and 
probably coming up this year, do 
you think that Michigan game is 
a good indicator of how well your 
team can perform in those?

TD: Absolutely. A lot of credit 

goes to one of our assistants, 
Coach (Brian) James, because 
he draws up all our late-game 
plays. He has all the specials, he 
has a lot of plays you didn’t even 
know even existed, to get you 
open opportunities. It’s fun to run 
those in practice, and hopefully 
we’ll get to use them a lot during 
the season.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Wolverines top Wildcats

By LELAND MITCHINSON

Daily Sports Writer

Going 
into 
the 
Michigan 

women’s 
basketball 
game 
at 

Northwestern 
on 
Tuesday, 

freshman 
center 
Hallie 
Thome was 
ranked second nationally in field 
goal percentage. And her offensive 
efficiency was on display once 
again against the Wildcats, as 
the Wolverines raced to a 70-65 
victory at Welsh-Ryan Arena.

For the second game in a row, 

Thome registered 20 or more 
points. Her 22 points on the night 
led the Wolverines (9-8 Big Ten, 
17-11 overall), and she was joined in 
double-digit scoring by sophomore 
guard Kateylnn Flaherty and 
junior guard Siera Thompson, 
who scored 17 and 13 points, 
respectively.

The Wolverines were slow to 

get going in the first half, scoring 
just 13 points in the first quarter, 
but they went into halftime with 
a five-point lead and never looked 
back.

“We’re a high-scoring team, 

and tonight we couldn’t really get 
the ball to fall in the basket,” said 

Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico 
in a postgame interview with Big 
Ten Network. “We had to grind it 
out on the defensive end and we 
found a way to do that.”

Thome came out of the locker 

room on fire, scoring six points in 
the first 4:28 of the second half, 
and the Wolverines extended their 
lead to 50-39 by the time the third 
quarter came to a close.

Though Michigan has had 

a potent offense all season, the 
Wolverines have struggled on the 
glass. But Michigan didn’t have 
any difficulty grabbing boards 
against Northwestern (4-13, 15-14) 
and, surprisingly, the Wolverine 
guards led the way in that 
category. Freshman guard Boogie 
Brozoski paced the team with 
seven rebounds and Thompson 
added another five to the total.

With just over two minutes left 

in the game, Brozoski drove the 
lane, drawing the Northwestern 
defenders and dishing it to Thome 
for an easy layup. That assist was 
one of Brozoski’s seven on the 
night and slowed the momentum 
the Wildcats had been building.

Northwestern was able to 

come within four points with 39 
seconds remaining and caused 
further concern when it pressed 

the Wolverines and stole the ball 
back. But the Wildcats rushed 
the shot and were forced to foul 
when Michigan collected the 
rebound.

With just 17 seconds remaining, 

Thome picked up her fifth foul and 
the Wildcats were able to cut the 
lead to four once more. However, 
the Wolverines stayed in control 
and made the free throws they 
needed in order to close out the 
game.

“I think we’ve really improved 

(our free throws),” Barnes Arico 
said to MGoBlue.com after the 
game. “The team as a whole, but 
also getting the right people the 
ball at the end of the basketball 
game to be fouled.”

The 
Wildcats 
were 
led 

offensively 
by 
forward 
Nia 

Coffey, who had 22 points while 
also creating problems for the 
Wolverines in the paint, as she 
compiled a career-high six blocks 
on the night. Northwestern also 
benefitted from 14 points from 
forward Pallas Kunaiyi-Akpanah 
and 11 assists from guard Ashley 
Deary.

Tuesday’s win puts Michigan 

above .500 in conference play for 
the first time this season, as they 
improved to 9-8.

CSG write-in votes could 
elect Jim Harbaugh’s son 

By MAX BULTMAN 

Managing Sports Editor

If 
Jim 
Harbaugh’s 
2016 

Central Student Government 
presidential campaign really 
is conducted with enthusiasm 
unknown to mankind, voters 
may be in for a surprise on 
election day.

Last 
year, 
the 
Michigan 

football 
coach 
made 
waves 

when he placed fourth in the 
CSG presidential election as 
a write-in candidate, with 115 
votes.

At 
the 
time, 
Harbaugh 

tweeted jokingly: “Disappointed 
w/4th place finish 4 @umich 
student body Pres. Competitive 
juices flowing! Hat in the ring 
for 2016 & will campaign w/ 
#EUTM”

Harbaugh’s 
2015 
votes 

ultimately didn’t amount to 
anything, but only because he 
was not enrolled as a student. 
This year could yield different 
results, 
though. 
While 
Jim 

Harbaugh the football coach is 
still not enrolled as a student, 
his son, James Harbaugh, is 
a freshman in LSA. Though 
James Harbaugh is not officially 
running for a CSG position, 
as a student he is eligible to 
be 
elected 
president, 
vice 

president or LSA representative 
as a write-in.

In other words, if students 

write in “Jim Harbaugh” on 
their ballots, Harbaugh’s son of 
the same name could be elected.

According to the election 

results 
available 
on 
the 

CSG 
website, 
45 
votes 

for 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
were 

officially counted in the LSA 
representative 
race 
in 
Fall 

2015, the younger Harbaugh’s 
first semester at Michigan. The 
lowest winning vote total for an 
LSA representative in the Fall 
2015 election was 535 votes.

These figures are from a 

“weighted” 
system, 
which 

awards a certain number of 

votes to candidates based on 
how high they are on the voter’s 
list of preferred candidates. In 
Fall 2015, Harbaugh appeared 
on 24 ballots — 21 as a first 
choice and three as a second 
choice for a final tally of 45 
votes.

There was also a single ballot 

cast for “Jimmy Harbaugh,” 
as well as another stray “Jim 
Harbaugh” ballot, but those 
votes were not counted. CSG 
Elections Director Ben Reese 
told The Michigan Daily this 
week that those votes could, 
and perhaps should, have been 
consolidated with the other 45, 
but since there were two clear 
winners, it would not have made 
a 
difference 

to the election 
results.

“People 

write in Jim 
Harbaugh 
in 
every 

election,” 
Reese 
said. 

“The 
write-

in is going to 
be a write-in. 
There’s 
no 

way I can control what people 
write in there. If it’s clear 
they’re voting the coach, like if 
people write, ‘Coach Harbaugh,’ 
those aren’t going to be counted 
toward (James).

“But if everybody is voting 

for James or Jimmy, I don’t 
know if I’ll combine ‘James’ and 
‘Jimmy.’ It just depends what 
the write-in ballots look like.”

Of course, Harbaugh’s son 

is not required to accept the 
position, even if he is elected. 
In the case he were elected 
as 
an 
LSA 
representative, 

and 
he 
declined, 
the 
LSA 

Student 
Government 
would 

simply 
appoint 
an 
interim 

representative 
to 
fill 
his 

vacancy until the next election.

Reese told the Daily last 

week that James Harbaugh 
would be eligible for election to 

any position in the LSA Student 
Government, as well as for 
president or vice president of 
the CSG Executive Committee. 
He would not, however, be 
eligible as a write-in candidate 
for any position in schools he 
is not enrolled in, such as the 
College of Engineering or Law 
School.

The CSG Election Code calls 

for the dismissal of ballots 
that are inappropriate. But the 
precedent set in Fall 2015, in 
which ballots with Harbaugh 
were counted, suggests votes 
for “Jim Harbaugh” could be 
counted as legitimate votes for 
Harbaugh the undergraduate.

“Given the choice between 

invalidating 
the ballot or 
counting 
the 

ballot toward 
someone who 
can 
actually 

be 
elected, 

I 
would 
be 

inclined 
to 

count 
it 
as 

a 
vote 
for 

someone who 
can actually be 

elected,” Reese said. “I would 
prefer to count more ballots as 
valid ballots than to assume 
that every vote for Jim is a 
vote for the coach. But they’re 
welcome to challenge that in 
(Central Student Judiciary) if 
they disagree with me.”

CSJ hears any cases on 

eligibility, election infractions 
or 
other 
contested 
issues 

surrounding the election.

This year’s CSG elections are 

slated to take place March 23 and 
24. Given past results, it does not 
seem likely that Harbaugh would 
accumulate 
enough 
write-in 

votes to make a serious threat at 
winning a representative seat, let 
alone the presidency. But given 
the coach’s popularity, it’s not 
impossible that, come March 25, 
there could be a Harbaugh ready 
to take office.

“People write in 
Jim Harbaugh 

in every 
election.”

“I hear you’re bad at sex,” she says to the boy. A chuck-

le bursts out but they don’t notice. No one ever notices 
the sometimes shy one posted against the wall, pants or 
no pants.

The boy looks startled a bit. She grins.
“Me? Who t(old) you that?” Pathetic, but who can 

blame the boy. The party noise eats the rest, so refocus 
to left eye corner. She’s still smiling, and so is the boy but 
less surely. Is that a pickup line? Her chin juts to a point 
and her black lipstick is good. Either way, what a fucking 
line. If this is a movie, the line is “Well, let me prove ‘em 
wrong.” But no one says that. This isn’t a movie.

She walks away and the boy goes back to looking 

for his coat in the coat mountain piled on the hallway 
couch. Canada Goose doesn’t win in these parts. The 
party is full of funny butts and sexy butts and uncom-
fortable losers with their pants on.

Sid walks by and slaps each naked hairy thigh, two 

laughs together and he’s gone. He’s here with one of the 
ones. Exposed in the hallway. Take a lap.

Took a lap and another shot. Living room still packed. 

Catie introduced Will. A golfer with another pointy 
chin. Couldn’t help imagining her letting him fuck her 
later after the cops come like she described over stir 
fry the other night. Alone on top of the stairs now sit-
ting. Watching them leave and come and drink and talk. 
For the one to talk to. Height is (in)escapable power 
that feels good to have. Heels Castles Dunks Penthouse 
Swimming Pools. 

One boy climbs and squeezes by in those new red 

briefs on the plastic person in American Apparel. Incon-
venient mannequin boner. The weirdness in the great-
ness of underwear. The anger in the disappointment in 
people who tried to shut this joy down. Don’t come if 
you’re uncomfortable.

One girl in the bedroom to the right is barfing bad. 

Check if she’s OK? Instead, stay seated, assume her girl-

friend is pulling back her hair. Like Aron in high school 
carrying one to the subway and riding uptown after 
washing the pavement a pink bottle of wine outside 
Gray’s Papaya in SoHo. First time and second to last so 
far. Proud of it.

Why come to these? is the classic loner thought. It’s 

goddamn Valentine’s Day, pants are off, and the ending 
is off to sleep. Came but didn’t come last time. Good play. 
Slinky down the stairs like Christmas lights twirled 
around the banister. 

Too drunk for all of it.
A mural appears on the stair wall of a cute village 

in a rural valley. Orange roofs littered between green 
trees below a big blue sky and faint clouds. Like a big fat 
beautiful cliché. Kid with ‘80s grandpa glasses butts in. 
Black plastic choker. Pale see-through skin like a seal. 
Say what’s known, judge what’s not. Fuck it. Denial is 
healthy sometimes. 

“Pretty amazing right?” His eyes look like conde-

scending politicians. “German exchange students 
painted it like a hundred years ago supposedly.” He 
knows too.

“Looks like Germany yeah.” Never been, but fuck it 

without fucking it. The period squashes his smile like a 
bubble of silence in the sound growing fast. Murdering 
conversation intentionally is satisfying sometimes. 

Take a piss. “Do you know where the bathroom is?” 

He points with skinny bones. “Thanks.”

Pissed on the seat and wiped it. A gold cased lipstick 

on the sink counter. Black on the mirror. A chuckle 
bursts and no one notices except the mirror. Eyes widen 
and vaseline lashes in the mirror. When you go back 
out, you’ll notice everyone again. The night girl with the 
black lipstick did one’s lips in the air — but next level is 
in the mirror. And on Wednesday sometime see her in 
the mirror at Cantinas with that Australian clementine. 
On a Wednesday.

Drunk and Overheard

B Y YA R D A I N A M R O N , L S A S E N I O R

Larva

B Y G AV I N G A O , L S A S E N I O R

It’s the first snow of a new year
where nothing is new, and everything 
wants to lug
its turgid body into the flour 

sack of quietude. Even the landscape unfurls 

its fur like the back of a white 
buffalo. Some child’s red 
balloon seized by the speartip of a mountain

ash, a bird heart quivering in the center 
of a coma. And the scare

-crow, strung up on a broomstick, bears 
the weight of his humiliation 
on his straw mind where 
winter falls upon a ryefield, and the owlet sings a
 
plain song of despair, its notes –
gurgling water in a mouth 
made out of blue cloth, the same gauze

the silkworms once
spun to fashion
a robe for an emperor, whose men and 
women prostrated before his palace, his servants 

swarming around his ivory 
throne like botflies
around a bull’s flank. The empress wore

her face like a carnival, her loneliness
so extravagant. She patted
the blue-lipped baby 
in her lap the way she 
stroked her husband’s pride. There’s a lot

to desire in this life. But not
these pale colonnades, or a woman’s 
shriek piercing the night 

like the light from a kerosene lamp. She 
stared into her garden 

and saw two geese atop the frozen
fountain, still as weathervanes,

huddling around a silver
egg, that nascent eye, that luminous
larva spoiled with love

given freely. The wolf
-white world just
shrugs, bats 

its infant eyelashes
and goes on to dream
another stillbirth.

Bywater Squabble

Eliza Cadoux 

Excerpted from Call Your Mom’s upcoming performance 

This Close

Blanche hollers
thinking I let the place go? I let the place go?
Only it’s me
And this isn’t Scene 1, and we are northerners
In this humid city
And I say
thinking I’ll let you go? I’ll let you go?
 
We rode bikes over
And over
Dark rings under your eyes
 
I equated myself to a flame
dancing wavering-nearly-going-out
And you
the wind
 
Let’s fight and dance until 
the stubbornness of New Orleans saves us

Little Sh*t

By Adam Depollo

Daily Arts Writer

It was fifty degrees in Orlando today, so every smart 

person stayed inside. Bob sat in his room watching a news-
man stand in the snow. I sat in the hotel lobby watching a 
middle 
aged man watching a newsman stand in the snow. 

I’m not sure if either of us enjoyed ourselves, but my sen-
tence was longer.

Later that afternoon, I sat in the jacuzzi reading “The 

Library of Babel,” which ends like this:

I venture to suggest this solution to the ancient prob-

lem: The Library is unlimited and cyclical. If an eternal 
traveler were to cross it in any direction, after centuries 
he would see that the same volumes were repeated in the 
same disorder (which, thus repeated, would be an order: 
the Order). My solitude is gladdened by this elegant hope.

Mar de Plata, 1941.
And so I turned to Jorge Luis Borges, who had insisted 

on wearing his three piece suit in the hot tub, and said 
—Jorge, didn’t you know that if you spent all day in the 
library, everything you wrote would come out covered in 
dust with a Dewey Decimal number? 

Borges pulled the Aleph out of his pocket and held it in 

front of my face, driving me insane for a moment until he 
placed it gingerly back into his jacket. Borges was blind, 
you know, so that was a fun little game he liked to play. He 
went back to making little splashes with his cane.

—Adam, he said, I remember once walking by your 

father in a hallway at Michigan State — this was long 
before he had ever thought about having you, of course — 
and thinking to myself ‘I wish I had a little shit hanging 
around all the time to let me know when my prose gets 
dusty.’

The world certainly is an interesting place, wouldn’t 

you say? One never knows who’s listening.

I started to get out of the jacuzzi, and Borges added —

Little Shit, didn’t you know that if you spent all day in your 
own head, everything you wrote would come out covered 
in blood with a bit of brain attached?

He started laughing, and I put my shirt back on. 
—You should probably take that off, he said. I think you 

need some sun. I can see you’re whiter than me! 

I walked away, and Borges shouted after me —And Lit-

tle Shit, stop pretending to be Roberto 

Bolaño!

OK 

By Cammie Finch 

LSA Senior

When you ask me “Are you OK?” 
you haven’t really asked me 
anything. 

What exactly are you 
implying? I wonder 
without asking 
because
I’m too far lost 
in your
tangled wood of 
acronymbleness. 

Am I …

an ornery kid? 
 (don’t sit me in time out
 this is our time now)

an original Keats? 
 (that’s right, bright star, 
 I dare not breathe without you) 

an occupied kangaroo? 
 (I’ve found my pouch, 
 my cradle, my comfort - 
 I’ve zipped it shut) 

an oceanic kebab? 
 (substance disintegrating downwards, 
 yet my skeleton structure floats on the surface. 
 the shriveled remains of memory go along
 for the ride)

an orangutan king? 
 (crown of thorns 
 eyes of wild
 heart of flaming orange 
 spirit)

an orbiting Kepler?
 (my head circles like Saturn circles
 around like Saturn circles around
 like Saturn circles around like Saturn) 

an omnipotent karma?
 (my presence tips the paint into your lap, 
 swerves cars into your lane. 
 my presence can make you rich, 
 can make you pay) 

an obliterated kayak?
 (the rapids have gotten too rough,
 can’t you feel my plastic splinters digging 
 into your hands?)

an obdurate kazoo? 
 (my mouth is plugged to spite you 
 that’s what we instruments can do)

an Orville kernel?
 (i’m ready to be transformed
 under pressure, watch me -
 i’m about to explode)

I can be any OK you want me to be.
I’m an overloaded kaleidoscope, 
twist me to see my colors 
change before your monochrome eyes. 
I can be any OK you want me to be - 
that is, with the proper specifications. 

OK? 

Nucleus

By Katarina Merlini

LSA Sophomore.

I’ve grown weary of my treacherous heart
for too long it’s sat vapid in my breast 
a thankless burden I could do without
like a scythe cutting silk it whispers in the night
the truths wound deeper than the lies

with yellowed nails I dug in deep
cracked through my ribs and slipped through sinew
I pulled it out with an old coat hanger
cleansed the wound with warm watered wine
and sewed it closed with willow vines

I’ve kept the withered thing in a mason jar
filled with formaldehyde
it’s grown an eye and watches me sleep
sometimes I ask him what he’s called
he has yet to answer me

Mindfulness

Cammie Finch, 

LSA Senior

inhale 
…
open your thighs wide
like the pages of a book
yawning their language
into your head

drink in the stillness
lift your spine taller 
and
prepare for the backbend
(you are stronger than
you think you are) 

envision the full moon
washing the back 
of your head with its
silken fingers, dripping
its nectar down your 
vertebrae until your 
seat is warm in thought

align your sacrum
to this intelligent
edge of backlit
realism (it’s magical)

breathe deeply into 
the beauty of 
asymmetry and 
savor your perfect
state of being 
vulnerable
(because i do). 

be aware of your breath: think - 
and then let it pull,
like an unknitted cloud,
away
with your 
…
exhale.

Wakeful: A Year in Sleeping
by Claire Bryan, Editorial Page Editor

Yesterday morning, I drank decaf coffee. Last 

night, I crawled into bed a little before midnight, 

but did not fall asleep until 3:30 or 4 a.m. And yet, 

now, at 6:11 a.m, I am a piercing, alert awake.

I shove my phone back onto my desk and push 

my eyes closed. The light from my phone’s screen 

creates an imprint on the insides of my eyelids. 

Instantaneously I begin to feel nervous (a feel-

ing I now grudgingly call anxious), but, because I 

refuse to be a victim, I get up, tuck my hair behind 

my ears and reach over to pull heavy blue cur-

tains open. Sitting on my bed, staring at the eerie 

morning light flooding across my crumpled blan-

kets, I open my laptop. There’s a word document 

titled “insomnia” saved in a folder titled “2015,” 

within another folder titled “don’t go there.” This 

document was created on February 21 at 7:19 p.m. 

It was reopened and added to on March 7, March 

23, April 7, 8 and 25. My pointer finger double 

clicks the document open and begins scrolling 

over the 5,000 plus words that exist inside.

As I type these words I have coursing waves of 

nerves brushing up and down through the inside 

of me. They originate in my gut, folded up behind 

my top abdominal, in the fleshy part of the carti-

lage that connects my top two ribs to my sternum. 

Sometimes a wave of nerves comes every time I 

take a breath in, sometimes a wave of nerves comes 

when I hear a noise, sometimes a wave doesn’t 

come and the lack of its not coming surprises me. I 

think about the lack of it, why this time the wave is 

absent, and, like clockwork, the wave does comes. It 

knows I’m thinking about it.

This word document contains the story I want 

to tell: about how anxiety leads to insomnia. But 

now that I’m upright, no longer attempting to fall 

asleep, reading over the words I wrote last year, 

I’m not anxious. I’m listening for those waves of 

nerves; I’m trying to feel for them. They do come 

sometimes these days, but today I can’t find them. 

This lapse or lack (I’m not sure which one yet) is 

the story I need to tell.

I’ve spent a year asking why my brain won’t 

let me sleep. I have found a lot of answers in a 

lot of different places. This summer I thought I 

fixed my sleeping, but in recent weeks I have been 

living too many 6 a.m. mornings. Fixing is com-

plicated and identifying the need to fix it is even 

more problematic. As I read tirelessly through my 

old writing, I’m asking myself a slightly different 

question: Why doesn’t my mind let me fall asleep 

even after I have understood why it won’t let me 

fall asleep in so many different ways?

***

Last September I moved into a sorority house 

with 55 other girls. A sorority house is a lot of 

things; loud is a good place to start. Floors creak, 

doors slam, voices travel sharply and into every 

corner of the house. I wish I could say I had 

trouble sleeping because I woke up when I heard 

noise. Or I wish I could say I had trouble sleeping 

because I laid in bed for a couple hours thinking 

about the homework looming over my head, or 

how I didn’t want to spend next summer at home 

in San Diego like I had in the past, or my recent 

and only break up with a boy who’d been my best 

friend for years — though all of those things I 

did wake up to and did think about. But sound 

is sound and thoughts are thoughts, and the two 

didn’t add up to me not sleeping.

As the weeks got colder and I remembered 

how foreign scarves and boots look on me, I told 

my three roommates and myself I had a lot on my 

mind. “How’d you sleep?” was the most common, 

courteous greeting, but when directed at me, 

it became an ache in my chest. It still is. I didn’t 

bother saying much more than “OK” because 

though some people are light sleepers and might 

understand if I said “not great,” saying “I don’t 

think I ever fell asleep last night” isn’t a break-

fast table conversation anyone wants to have. In 

quiet moments, I did say that last phrase, but the 

conversation fell bitterly silent because I didn’t 

have anything to say after that initial observa-

tion. Friends would ask why and I’d try to explain 

what I was thinking about but ultimately end 

in saying to them, “I don’t really get it.” They 

wouldn’t either.

I began “going to sleep” as early as I could, 

crawling into the corner of my top bunk bed 

around 11 p.m. I’d lie for hours, listening for when 

each roommate would come in the heavy door. 

One, two hours passing, three, all right everyone 

was home I thought. Then I’d lie watching for the 

sinking into sleep feeling to overcome me. When 

it wasn’t coming, I’d become frustrated that I 

wasn’t getting sleep nor was I getting work done. 

This intersection of two nonproductive truths 

was a driving center point that I fixated on. Some 

nights, around five or six in the morning I think 

I drifted, behind my thoughts, into a light sleep. 

At 7 a.m. my roommate’s alarm would go off and 

she’d dress to go on a run and I was wide-awake.

I drank coffee and went to class and went to 

meetings and wrote my stories for the student 

newspaper, and though I was exhausted each day 

that passed I reasoned with myself: I was stressed 

and college was noisy. I identified what hap-

pened at night in terms of when my roommates 

came home and when I heard noise and nothing 

more. I told myself I was OK in the morning, and 

throughout the day I could almost forget I even 

told myself that. For weeks, it was survivable. 

Months later, it was unbearable. But that was the 

trickiest part about all of this, and still is: There is 

a lot of truth in that simple phrase. I am OK.

***

My sister Robyn is two years older than me, 

but most people who meet us when we are stand-

ing side by side mistake us as twins. We are both 

five foot six, a hundred and twenty-five pounds, 

have the same dirty blonde hair, wave our hands 

the same way when we rant, had the same major 

at the same school (I get “Hi Robyn” on campus 

at least once a day) and have identical dream jobs.

In high school I could spend all week with 

Robyn: sit with her at lunch at school, drive home 

and do homework in her bed with her, hate walk-

ing the ten steps down the hall to fall asleep in 

separate rooms. When Friday night rolled around 

and friends would suggest seeing us we could 

decide to go to our favorite Japanese restaurant 

— where the waitresses knew us by the “twins” 

and the menu hadn’t changed in eight years — 

and I would still feel like I had a lifetime to catch 

her up on.

Senior year of high school I wrote a profile on 

Robyn. At the end of nine pages I tried to pin-

point the relationship Robyn and I have — how 

marvelously strange it is to have someone on this 

earth who mirrors your same goals in life but 

is not yourself and can challenge you and make 

you grow pretty perfectly. Our thoughts weren’t 

the same hair strands, but they weaved together 

tightly making us strong.

The two of us want to invent a lot of words. 

Like for the feeling you feel when you are per-

fectly full, but not just the word content, it must 

apply to eating only. Or the word for daydream-

ing when you are trying to fall asleep but not fully 

dreaming yet. Or a word to describe a process we 

always thought was possible: getting rid of the 

common cold by pretending you don’t have one. 

Robyn used to always remind me that life is too 

cool to sleep and we always wanted a name for 

that quality, the sleep-when-you’re-dead quality 

about someone, about us.

When we met my older brother’s girlfriend 

for the first time we thought she was too uptight 

— she lived alone in a tidy one-room studio, she 

had her days planned into a scheduling book, she 

checked off the lists that created her days reli-

giously. I never thought I would become someone 

who needs to count the hours of sleep I’m getting 

or brush my teeth at a certain time or make my 

bed perfectly or tell Robyn I couldn’t go to the 

Arb at 2 a.m. All of these things I became.

***

In November I took a lot of NyQuil, the blue 

gels that were shoved in the bottom of my desk 

drawer that my dad bought me freshman year. 

Thinking the antihistamines would help me 

sleep, I began to take the pills every night before 

going to bed. I couldn’t have been more wrong. 

The pills would make my body heavy and drowsy 

and craving sleep, yet my mind would still run 

with thoughts and never stop. It was tormenting.

One night when snow wasn’t on the ground 

yet, I ran out of NyQuil and walked to Walgreens 

to buy a box of ZzzQuil. On the second floor they 

had only shelved the extra large box. When I 

placed it on the counter along with toothpaste 

and a bag of almonds the cashier picked it up to 

scan it.

“Someone’s really trying to sleep,” he said 

while laughing a bit, low and loud. I tried to place 

his accent. He sounded Southern, but maybe that 

was still Midwestern. I laughed, just slightly, 

more to myself than to him.

“You know, in college I had the worst insom-

nia,” he continued. I looked at him, wide-eyed, 

wanting to hear more but not knowing if he’d 

continue and not willing to push him to.

“My girlfriend broke up with me and all I 

could think about was how I had screwed it up. I 

let it keep me up all night. I was a fool. I should’ve 

just gone to bed!” He smiled at me, as if it was that 

simple, paused and then after another low laugh 

said, “I’m just saying you can get really addicted 

to these things. I know.”

I tried to explain to him that they only shelved 

the extra large box and I didn’t really need that 

much. I don’t know if I would have taken ZzzQuil 

every night if I had bought that box. Before I 

paid, I asked him to take it off my bill. I walked 

home thinking that it had been weeks since I had 

thought about the nights in September when I did 

think about that summer’s breakup.

As I pull sticky contact lenses from my eyes, 

brush my teeth and crawl into an oversized t-shirt 

I often feel physically sick. I dread getting into bed 

because I know that it will begin my war with sleep. 

Where I fight to keep my eyes closed as wave after 

wave of once invigorating butterflies of nerves pulse 

up and down my body relentlessly. I often lay in bed 

for four or five or six hours not being able to silence 

my mind that runs around violently and carelessly 

with my thoughts. My eyelids tremor unknowing 

to the confusion beyond my skull and my muscle. 

When I wake up I don’t feel as if I am waking up. 

I feel woken, frightened, moved and rearranged 

forcefully in the middle of the night, but sun is shin-

ing through my window.

By January my sleeping got worse and my 

tiredness evolved into an unfamiliar tiredness. 

I no longer craved for heavy blankets and my 

eyes to close. My body buzzed with these anx-

ious feelings, and I began to hate lying around 

and listening to them. What I hated more was 

how physically and mentally weak I felt. What I 

hated most was how I didn’t want to admit these 

weaknesses. And so I didn’t. The sockets of my 

eyes began to grow darker and darker shadows. I 

stood in front of the mirror and stared at the two 

semicircles of pulsing skin right under my eyes. 

The skin was colored a grey-purple; if I stared 

really close there were the tiniest light pink spots 

mixed in between. My eyes would sting — this 

sour, painful sting — every time my eyelids closed 

and reopened. I didn’t recognize both the feel and 

the look of my own eyes anymore. I don’t know 

how much of it was in my head and how much of 

it was reality, but I began to not look like myself. I 

stopped feeling like myself months ago.

***

The first week of February, I sat in a small 

waiting room with six black chairs and a coffee 

table piled high with newspapers and two differ-

ent succulent plants. I was shaking just slightly, 

as I scrambled to fill in the mountain of papers 

on my lap that I was supposed to complete before 

my first appointment at Ann Arbor Consultation 

Services.

“Please list who you live with, your relation-

ship to them, a description of who they are, are 

you satisfied with this relationship — yes or no?”

I began laughing, a shallow laugh, out loud, at 

myself. A girl or lady — she looked around 25— 

sitting two seats away looked over. Harsh, black-

framed glasses dominated her face. Her hair was 

red and pixie cut. I wondered why she was here. 

And then hated myself for asking that question, 

hated myself for living every cliché movie scene 

of a therapist waiting room where the main char-

acter dreams up what everyone’s problem is.

I wrote down “55,” then the word “girls,” then 

paused for a moment and eventually wrote the 

word “friends.” The ballpoint pen I was using left 

a black blob of excess ink at the start of the “f” of 

friends; my handwriting looked ugly. I couldn’t 

muster much else more to begin to justify what 

my life was in a sorority. Justifying how I couldn’t 

imagine my life without it brought its own anxi-

eties.

Folded up in a notebook of mine, I have a piece 

of paper that states in large, spidery handwriting 

“General Anxiety Disorder” with a string of num-

bers after it that I was supposed to call and repeat 


Wednesday, February 24, 2016 // The Statement 
 
7B

to my health insurance company but never did. It 

was given to me nine weeks ago by a therapist… my 

therapist. I kept it because it gave me concreteness 

every time I opened this notebook that sat on the 

desk next to my bed, it told me — or by keeping it 

there I was trying to get it to tell me — a piece of 

my identity.

“This is the room we have available at this 

time, it is typically for our younger patients, I 

apologize,” I was told on the first day of therapy 

as I entered a room painted blue full of puzzles 

and toy blocks. I made a joke about loving puz-

zles, grabbed a piece, and played with it between 

my pointer finger and thumb as I thought. I spent 

an hour on a couch every week. I practiced cog-

nitive behavioral therapy on white worksheets. I 

talked a lot. I didn’t hate it. I learned a lot: how 

my brain had created unhealthy synapses 

where when I heard one noise, no matter 

how small, I jumped to thinking I would 

never be able to fall asleep when in truth 

it was a pretty small noise. How other 

things, like not going to bed on time or it 

not being fully dark in my room, linked 

another unhealthy jump in my mind tell-

ing me I’ll never be able to sleep. Every 

time these synapses fire they create 

deeper and deeper grooves in my neuro-

logical paths that release anxious feelings 

within me. My brain was making these 

well-worn grooves and I had to train it 

not to follow down the same problematic 

grooves every night.

I learned something really heart-

breaking about the freedom of thought. 

I used to believe that every thought 

was your own and was healthy and true 

and deserved to be thought about and 

explored. I learned that this wasn’t true.

***

According to the Anxiety and Depres-

sion Association of America, anxiety is 

the most common mental illness in the 

United States. I paid a lot of money and 

spent a lot of mornings hoping my sis-

ter’s car that wasn’t built for snowy roads 

would survive a 10-minute drive to a therapist’s 

office to be diagnosed with the most general dis-

order that exists in the world. And now, I, too, 

was this basic denominator. I was the statistic 

written at the top of news articles addressing 

“mental health awareness” that were pitched in 

the newsroom.

I have typed the word insomnia into Google 

a few hundred times. Insomnia can be classified 

into four categories: transient (insomnia lasting a 

single night or a few weeks), intermittent (if tran-

sient episodes occur from time to time), chronic 

(if insomnia occurs most nights and lasts a month 

or more) or secondary (when insomnia is a side 

effect of another problem, a symptom of an emo-

tional, neurological, or other medical disorder.)

I believe I have experienced all four of these 

types. The most prominent, and also the hard-

est to accept, is the secondary type — my anxi-

ety gives me insomnia. But I don’t know if those 

words are true — the word insomnia and the 

word anxiety can very much be reversed in that 

sentence. My insomnia gave me anxiety. Because 

I could’ve sworn to you those first nights not 

sleeping there were no waves of nerves, I just sim-

ply couldn’t sleep. Or, were the waves there and I 

just didn’t have a word to call them by? Did defin-

ing them “anxiety” make them occur more often? 

Did identifying a problem help solve it or simply 

and boldly accentuate it?

***

I traveled to New Hampshire in a minivan 

with five strangers at the start of May. We had 

all signed up for the New England Literature 

Program and would be camping and backpack-

ing while studying the work of New England 

authors together. As hours of the drive stretched 

on and secrets seemed to be exposed like they 

were nothing fragile between us, I told them I 

was worried about my sleeping. I didn’t know in 

that minivan that I was about to spend six weeks 

learning how to sleep again. At night, my body 

would not feel anxious and buzzing but instead 

be calm enough to actually crave sleep now that 

it had been reminded how good sleep felt. There 

are a lot of things to fall in love with in the care-

fully crafted community of NELP. Sleep was my 

largest love affair.

When we spent three days in the pouring rain 

on the Pemigewasset trail, a trip we had to cut 

short due to the harsh weather, I faced my anxi-

ety with higher physical stakes. Instead of hav-

ing to wake up and walk my body through Ann 

Arbor to class, I had to be rested enough to climb 

a mountain.

When the last week of the program came and 

I still hadn’t taken a solo camping trip where you 

hike out and set up camp to spend 24 hours com-

pletely alone, I began to think about and realize 

why. I imagined all the waves of nerves finding 

me in a small green tent with thick rows of birch 

trees and miles of lake water around me. I knew I 

would spend 24 hours wide awake, counting the 

waves of nerves pulsing up and down the insides 

of me. After the dishes were cleaned that night, I 

signed myself up anyway.

On my solo, when the sun went down and 

I crawled into my sleeping bag, I couldn’t find 

the waves of nerves. And where in the past the 

searching for waves typically brought them 

running to me, none came. I fell asleep effort-

lessly, on a slanted hill because I couldn’t find 

flatter ground, on twigs and branches and rough 

dirt because I didn’t do a good job of clearing 

the ground, listening to strange animals thud 

through the brush. Despite all of the unhealthy 

synapse-inducing factors, I slept.

***

This year, as I folded sheets under my mattress 

and pushed pins into a tapestry to hang on my 

wall, I told myself I was constructing a purpose-

ful place to sleep. I told myself it was going to be 

different this year.

It is different, of course it is, but sleep doesn’t 

come like it did in New Hampshire or in San 

Diego or in Washington D.C., where I spent the 

rest of the summer. It seems to remember it is 

unwelcome here in Ann Arbor. 

Sometimes I go to class with the old exhaus-

tion. But sometimes there are days when some-

one answers my question of "how are you?" with 

“good, but tired” and I feel like I can actually 

relate because I feel a normal amount of tired. 

There is never a night I fall asleep — that luxuri-

ous sinking feeling that I miss — effortlessly.

The second week of the semester I sat on a 

black couch and a boy asked me to explain why 

I said I didn’t want to see him anymore after a 

very sudden and short amount of time. I scram-

bled with too many words, trying to explain how 

I have problems sleeping and don’t understand 

it fully and his presence in my life added more 

waves of nerves and less sleep. I didn’t say to 

him what I have written here. I fumbled a lot. He 

looked at me and said, “Claire, that’s the point. 

You have general anxiety disorder; you don’t have 

to explain it. It is a clinical disorder.”

Maybe he’s right; maybe I need to get better 

at understanding the clinical part of my disorder. 

Maybe I need to pull out that white piece of paper 

that has my diagnosis on it and study it, learn to 

cope with the tangible symptoms of anxiety. To 

accept that my insufficiencies are excused by 

my diagnosis. Maybe my exhaustion will finally 

evaporate if I can stop trying to solve my anxi-

ety, to cure it. But here is the difference: It is not 

as simple as what all the thought catalogs and 

WordPress blogs from every anxiety-suffering 

teen who preaches to accept yourself and become 

not a statistic but a normality, because I have tast-

ed cured-ness. In New Hampshire I was strong. I 

know I do not have to live sleepless.

There is something sickening attached to 

what I learned in therapy, attached to this clini-

cal part. I learned that my brain, my self, cre-

ated unhealthy neurological pathways. I made 

so many unhealthy choices that I gave myself a 

disorder. Though I am trying to pull myself out of 

those deep problematic neurological pathways, I 

am haunted by this idea that I gave myself a dis-

order.

***

It is a strange sensation to watch your-

self in very real, tangible ways change 

into a person you don’t recognize. Last 

year I noticed I’d creep away from loud 

conversations and into the confines of my 

bedroom. Outside of my house, I noticed 

when conversations got loud more often 

and would remove myself from them, 

not commenting or speaking up. In these 

awake times, there were never waves of 

anxiety. So why was I creating distance 

between myself and the people around 

me? Why, when I genuinely liked and 

wanted to share my life with the people 

around me, was I reverting more inward-

ly than ever?

So this week I sat on each of my room-

mates’ beds and challenged myself to 

explain my insomnia, something I always 

struggled to make public. As I opened 

my mouth an elevator speech of what my 

insomnia is like flowed from my mouth, 

and, strangely, I didn’t hate it. I said it 

seven times, to each of them, and for the 

first time in a long time I recognized and 

liked the sound of my own voice. I wasn’t 

explaining a diagnosis, I wasn’t explain-

ing a definition of insomnia that I had 

Googled, I was explaining, quite simply, 

me.

Just like those deep grooves that are the 

neurological pathways in my brain, I’m typing 

these words to create new grooves that lead to 

a healthy explanation of my anxiety. I’m pull-

ing myself out of the problematic grooves. I’m 

remapping my brain.

I’ll now always think of my anxiety as not 

general, not the same, most common mental 

disorder in the country, not everyone else’s. I’ll 

think of it as this peculiar, hybrid disorder that 

surfaces only in this unique arena right before 

and right after sleep. Sleep is a romantic time 

between self-awareness and self-lost-ness, and I 

feel lucky my anxiety allows me to exist so alert 

in these times: They might be the most impor-

tant. I’ll share what I can about this precious 

part of me and I’ll know sharing feels reassuring 

and rewarding. But I won’t forget that there is 

beauty in the nuances of my secret: There will 

always be a little bit of all of this that is still 

unsolved, and I’m not afraid, worried or anxious 

to keep that part to myself.

I am going to create a new word for my type of 

anxiety — a precious type that only comes alive 

in the secret moments in between the conscious 

and the unconscious. That word will be all mine.
