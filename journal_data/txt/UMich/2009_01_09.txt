Rep. Schauer says
stimulus must address
middle-classconcerns
By BENJAMIN S. CHASE
Daily StaffReporter
Faced with an economy in tail-
spin and a recent federal report
predicting a $1.2 trillion budget def-
icit in 2009, President-elect Barack
Obama unveiled more details about
his economic stimulus at George
Mason University yesterday.
Dubbed the "American Recovery
and Reinvestment Plan," it pledges
to invest heavily in infrastructure
upgrades nationwide, including
improvements to bridges, roads
and mass transportation, dramati-
cally expand alternative energy
research spending and modernize
Medicare and Medicaid.
The plan hopes to create 3 mil-
lion new jobs and provide direct
tax relief to 95 percent of American
workers. It also hopes to double of
renewable energy production.
The economic stimulus package
will focus heavily on reinvestment
in infrastructure, government pro-
grams and health and social ser-
vices at a state level, which could
help relieve some of Michigan's
economic hardships.
Rep. Mark Schauer, a first-term
Democrat from Battle Creek, has
pledged to support the economic
recovery package.
"As we invest in rebuilding
our economy, Michigan needs to
receive special help," Schauer said
in an interview yesterday, add-
ing that such help would need to

include "tax relief for middle-class
families."
A member of the House Trans-
portation and Infrastructure Com-
mittee, Schauer saidhe is dedicated
to taking a hands-on approach to
promoting alternative energy ini-
tiatives and tackling infrastructure
improvementsbothnationwide and
in Michigan.
Schauer said these initiatives
will be essential for the survival
of the Detroit automakers, all
reeling from reported declines of
more than 30 percent in sales for
the month of December. Chrysler
was hardest hit by the economic
downturn, with its December sales
plummeting 53 percent compared
to figures from the same month last
year.
In a letter to Speaker of the
House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)
and House Minority Leader John
Boehner (R-Ohio) earlier this
week, Schauer outlined his goals
for the economic stimulus package
and the changes it will bring to the
American economy.
"No state has been hit harder by
the economic crisis than Michi-
gan,"Schauer saidintheletter, "and
instead of waiting for more bridges
to collapse, or for home heating and
fuel costs to climb back to record
highs, we can make a down pay-
ment on long-term job growth and
sustain our natural resources for
future generations."
The proposed package will
likely cost the federal government
between $675 and $775 billion to
implement, accordingto the Obama
transition team and Democratic
Party leaders in Congress.

175 gather to push for
peace after Israeli
strikes in Gaza
By MATT AARONSON
and AMY MUNSLOW
Daily StaffReporters
About 175 people joined in a
candlelight vigil last night to pro-
testtherecentoutbreak of violence
in Gaza.
The vigil, which took place at
the corner of Liberty Street and
Main Street, was organized by
local activist groups Michigan
Peaceworks and Interfaith Council
for Peace & Justice, among others.
The event was also sponsored by

local Jewish and Muslim groups
seeking a cession of violence in the
region.
As of last night, The Associated
Press reported about 750 Palestin-
ians and 13 Israelis have died since
the beginning of Israel's military
assault on Dec. 27. A quarter of the
Palestinian deaths were civilians.
The event was peaceful, with
demonstrators of all ages and back-
grounds lining both sides of the
street holding candles and signs,
talking softly with one another in
the snow.
"We want to see a ceasefire and
we want to see humanitarian aid
allowed into Gaza," said Chuck
Warpehoski, director of ICPJ.
News of a U.N. Security Council
cease-fire resolution broke shortly

after the vigil ended.
Laura Russello, Michigan Peace-
works' executive director, said the
vigil was meant to promote peace
not a particular political stance.
She said she was proud of the will-
ingness of a wide range of groups
to stand together against violence.
"In order to promote peace, we
have to demonstrate peace in our
community," she said. "Our mes-
sage is to bring together local Jew-
ish and Muslim communities and
show that these groups can work
together toward a peaceful solu-
tion."
The event was planned in three
days and publicized primar-
ily through word of mouth, e-mail
and posters, Russello said.
Warpehoski said organizers

weren't sure that they would be
able to get many people to attend
the event on such short notice, but
that "the response has been tre-
mendous."
Demonstrator Matt Bussey, a
graduate student at the Universi-
ty's Center for Middle Eastern and
North African Studies, said he was
impressed by the large turnout for
the vigil.
"It's heartening to see all these
people come out. A lot of people
don't know what is going on," said
Bussey, who lived in Jerusalem for
six years and has family currently
living in Israel.
Lauren Ramanathan, a Swarth-
more College sophomore from Ann
Arbor, said she joined Michigan

GOVERNING GREEK LIFE
Panhel president
aims to unify Greeks

Local eateries closed after flood

By VERONICA MENALDI
DailyStaffReporter .
LSA junior Rachael Reeves said
in high school she never would
have dreamed that almost three
years into college she would be
giving speeches and running
meetings. But as the newly elected
president of the Panhellenic Asso-
ciation, the group responsible for
governing most sororities on cam-
pus, she'll be doing just that.
Reeves said that the major focus
of her time in office will be work-
ing to bring the Greek community
closer together.
She said being involved in
Greek life, .as the former presi-
dent of Alpha Chi Omega sorority,
empowered her and gave her the
support and courage necessary to
become a student leader.
"I was strongly encouraged by
the women in my own sorority to
run for president of my house,"
Reeves said. "I feel as if my expe-
rience as president of my sorority
has given me the skills to capably
run an executive board, but those
skills will, of course, have to be
tailored to a more diverse com-
munity."
Reeves said her main goal as
Panhel president is to increase
junior and senior retention and
work more closely with members

of the other three Greek councils.
"I have personal intentions
that I would love to see contin-
ued through 2009," Reeves said.
"These include building strong
relationships with IFC and the
multicultural councils, older
members of the Greek system
and other organizations such as
Healthy Houses."
Reeves said she doesn't have
specific plans -in mind for how
she'll work with the other Greek
councils, but added that collabora-
tion will be extremely important
for the future of the Greek sys-
tem.
"The Greek system needs to
focus onunity, and by polishingthe
skills necessary to run a board and
interact well with the members,
other organizations, the adults
and the University of Michigan,
it'll be possible," Reeves said.
Besides reaching out to other
Greek councils, Reeves said she
also wants to focus on internal
issues within Panhel, but she
won't decide on any specific plans
until she meets with the rest of the
executive board.
"I believe that goals warrant
specific timelines and need to be
formulated as a group, as Panhel
works as a team," Reeves said.

Bubble Island, The
Blue Leprechaun yet
to re-open after pipe
break causes damage
By LINDSAY KRAMER
For the Daily
Students returning to campus
with a craving for bubble tea or fish
and chips may have to wait to get
their fill. A flood on Dec. 24 forced
South University mainstays Bubble
Island and The Blue Leprechaun to
temporarily close their doors while
damages are repaired.
A broken pipe in the fire sprin-
kler system in Big House Tanning
caused the flooding, which was
reported to the Ann Arbor Fire
Department at about 5 p.m. on the
day of the incident. All of the busi-
nesses in the complex located on
the southwest corner of South For-
est Avenue and South University
Avenue closed following the inci-
dent, but all have since reopened
except for Bubble Island and The
Blue Leprechaun.
The Blue Leprechaun, for-
merly Touchdown Cafe, suffered
$285,000 in damages from the
flood. Starting last April, the space
underwent renovations to trans-
form the formerly club-style bar
into a pub. The flood has forced
the restaurant to replace its floors,
electronics and ceilings that had
only been in use since the pub's

opening in late August.
Perry Porikos, the co-owner of
the restaurant, said it was unfortu-
nate that the flood came only a few
short months after the renovations.
"We wereopened for four months
in a brand new place," he said.
But Porikos said that he expects
to re-open in the next few days and
remains optimistic that his business
won't be affected in the long run.
"We established a pretty "good

following for the past few months,"
he said. "We have enough space to
attract big groups for after games
or for after school drinks during
the week, so hopefully we won't be
affected."
Bubble Island also suffered
extensive damage as vi result of the
flood. The shop is still under con-
struction to replace the drywall
and ceiling. Most of the food inven-
tory was also destroyed, but most of

the tea-making equipment was not
damaged. The store will re-open on
Monday according to a sign on its
front door.
Amy Wang, the shop's assis-
tant general manager, said Bubble
Island lost business from both local
customers and University students
because of the flood. "(The flood)
has affected business because we
were still making decent money

NEWS BRIEFS
WASHINGTON
Obama tax plan
finds opposition in
Senate
President-elect Barack Obama's
proposed tax cuts ran into opposi-
tion Thursday from senators in his
own party who said they wouldn't
do much to stimulate the economy
or create jobs.
Senators from both parties
agreed that Congress should do
something to stimulate the econ-
omy. But Democratic senators
emerging from a private meeting
of the Senate Finance Committee
criticized business and individ-
ual tax cuts in Obama's stimulus
plan.
They were especially critical
of a proposed $3,000 tax credit
for companies that hire or retrain
workers.
"If I'm a business person, it's
unlikely if you give me a several-
thousand-dollar credit that I'm
going to hire people if I can't sell
the products they're producing,"
said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., a
member of the committee.
"That to me is just misdirected,"
Conrad said.
WASHINGTON
Cheney: No one
saw economic
crisis coming
Vice President Dick Cheney
said Thursday that he sees no rea-
son for President George W. Bush
to pre-emptively pardon anyone at
the CIA involved in harsh interro-
gations of suspected terrorists. "I
don't have any reason to believe
that anybody in the agency did
anything illegal," he said.
In an interview with The Asso-
ciated Press, Cheney also said that
Bush has no need to apologize for
not foreseeing the economic crisis.
"I don't think he needs to apol-
ogize. I think what he needed to
do is take bold, aggressive action
and he has," Cheney said.
"I don't think anybody saw it
coming," he said.
During a wide-ranging inter-
view lasting about 25 minutes,
Cheney also said Iran remains
at the top of the list of foreign
policy challenges that President-
elect Barack Obama will face.
He said an "irresponsible with-
drawal" from Iraq now would be
ill-advised.
CHICAGO
Blagojevich office
says impeach vote
was 'not a surprise'
Ill. Gov. Rod Blagojevich's office
has blasted the impeachment pro-
ceedings as "flawed" and "biased."
The Democratic governor's
office calls Thursday's unanimous
House impeachment panel vote
"not a surprise." It also predicts
he'll be impeached by the full
House, saying the outcome will be
different "when the case moves to
the Senate."

The House could vote on the
panel's recommendation .Fri-
day and then send it to the Sen-
ate, where a trial would be held
to decide if Blagojevich will be
removed from office.
r Blagojevich was arrested last
month on federal corruption
charges that included trying to sell
off President-elect Barack Obama's
vacant U.S. Senate seat.
OAKLAND, Calif.
Fatal Calif. train
station shooting
sparks anger
Protests over the fatal shooting
of an unarmed man by a Bay Area
Rapid Transit police officer turned
violent Wednesday night, with
windows broken, streets shut down
and train stations closed.
Hundreds of protesters took to
the streets of Oakland to condemn
the shooting and call for criminal
charges against 27-year-old officer
Johannes Mehserle.
Mehserle resigned from the
transit agency shortly before he
was supposed to be interviewed by
investigators Wednesday.
Mehserle is accused of shoot-
ing 22-year-old Oscar Grant of
Hayward, who was lying face-
down on the station platform
when he was shot and killed early
New Year's Day. Mehserle was
one of several officers responding
to reports about groups of men
fighting on a train.

Northwest floodingY closes
roads, stalls co-mmerce

No serious injuries
after heavy rains,
avalanches
CENTRALIA, Wash. (AP) -
Floods, mudslides and avalanches
in the Pacific Northwest kept tens
of thousands of people from their
homes Thursday, brought freight
trains to a standstill and stranded
hundreds of trucks alongthe major
highways that link Seattle's busy
ports with markets around the
country.
The flooding - some of the
worst on record in Washington
state - was touched off by a com-
bination of heavy rain of 6 inches
or more and a warm spell in the
mid-40s that rapidly melted the
snow in the Cascade Range.
A 20-mile stretch of Interstate 5,
the state's major north-south free-
way, was shut down between Olym-
pia and the Oregon line, with one
section area under 3 feet of water.
Avalanches closed I-90, which cuts
east from Seattle through the Cas-
cades, along with the two other
routes through the mountains.
Amtrak service and most freight
trains were stopped as well.
Hundreds of truckers pulled
their rigs off onto the shoulders
or packed truck stops as the bad
weather bottled up nearly all

freight in and around Seattle, cost-
ing the economy untold millions of
dollars of day.
. "You can't go north, you can't
go east, you can't go south. What
are my options?" said Jon Amer-
man, a trucker from White Hall,
Mont., who had planned to head
east to Yakima to pick up apples
after delivering a load of goods to
Seattle. Instead, he pulled over to
the side, and figured his company
was losing more than $1,000 a day
every day that he was idle.
More than 30,000 people
in western Washington were
urged to evacuate their homes
on Wednesday in low-lying areas
from Bellingham near the Cana-
dian border to the Kelso area near
the Oregon line as rivers spilled
over their banks and flooded some
neighborhoods.
The stricken areas included such
far-flung Seattle bedroom com-
munities as Fife, Orting and Sno-
homish, but Seattle itself saw little
flooding.
Rescuers used boats to evacu-
ate scores of people from nursing
homes. Fire trucks rolled through
the streets, using loudspeakers to
warn people to leave.
No serious injuries were
reported.
"I think we're seeing an all-tim-
er, or as bad as anyone has seen,"
said Rob Harper, a spokesman for

the state Division of Emergency
Management. "We just haven't
seen this extent of flooding."
Many rivers were still rising
Thursday, though others began
dropping as the heavy rain sub-
sided and snowmelt lessened with
falling temperatures.
State officials said the danger of
avalanches would keep I-90 closed
at Snoqualmie Pass at least until
Friday, and I-5 would probably still
be flooded over the weekend.
Crews struggled to reopen high-
ways, especially those leading to
communities cut off by the flooding
and avalanches.
In Orting, a town near Mount
Rainier, Jamie Hicks used five
pumps to try to clear the 21/2 feet
of water from his house, about 50
yards from the swollen Puyallup
River.
"We're veterans at this," Hicks
said as his son rowed a boat in
front of the house. "You just pump
it out."
In Snohomish, about 30 miles
north of Seattle, a crowd watched
as Robert Bishop and his room-
mates were rescued by boat from
their two-story duplex. The home
close to the Pilchuck River was
nearly half underwater.
"I thought it was fine, but it went
higherthan Ithought," said Bishop,
48, who waited out previous floods.
"It was very scary."

U.S. abstains from
14-0 vote
UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The
U.N. Security Council approved
a resolution Thursday night call-
ing for an immediate and durable
cease-fire between Hamas mili-
tants and Israeli forces in Gaza.
The U.S. abstained from the 14-0
vote.
Israel and Hamas were not par-
ties to the vote and it will now
be up to them to stop the fight,
ing. But the text of the resolution
was hammered out by the United
States, Israel's chief ally, and by
Arab nations that have ties to.
Hamas and the Palestinians inthe
Israeli-occupied territories.
"We are all very conscious that
peace is made on the ground while
resolutions are written in the Unit-
ed Nations," British Foreign Secre-
tary David Miliband said.
U.S. Secretary of State Condo-
leezza Rice said the United States
"fully supports" the resolution
but abstained because it "thought
it important to see the outcomes
of the Egyptian mediation" with
Israel and Hamas, aimed at
achieving a cease-fire.
The Egyptian and French ini-
tiative must be "not just applaud-
ed, but supported," she said.
In deciding that the U.S. should
not block the resolution, Rice said,
"the Security Council has pro-
vided a road map for a sustainable,
durable peace in Gaza."
The decision came on the 13th
day of an Israeli air and ground
offensive against the Islamic
group Hamas which rules Gaza
and has been launching rockets
and mortars into southern Israel
for years. It followed three days
of intense negotiations between
ministers from key Arab nations
and the council's veto-wielding
Western powers - the U.S., Brit-
ain and France.
With Palestinian civilian casu-
alties mounting, the Arabs were
under intense pressure to get a
resolution - and several diplo-
mats said they wanted it before
Friday prayers at mosques in the
region.

As of Thursday, about 750 Pal-
estinians, at least a quarter civil-
ians, had been killed along with 13
Israelis.
Theresolutionexpressed"grave
concern" at the escalatingviolence
and the deepening humanitarian
crisis in Gaza and emphasized the
need to open all border crossings
and achieve a lasting solution to
the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Arab nations called for the
emergency Security Council
meeting to get the council to call
for an immediate cease-fire.
They had been pressing their
own resolution, which not only
would have demanded an end to
all military activity in Gaza but
was revised to include mention
of Hamas by name and call for
an international force to prevent
arms smuggling - two key U.S.
demands.
But the changes in the Arab
text didn't meet all the demands
of the United States and its
key Western allies, Britain and
France, all veto-wielding mem-
bers of the council.
Those nations countered by
shelving a weaker "presidential
statement" they had proposed
Wednesday and introducing a rival
resolution written by the British.
The resolution "stresses the
urgency of and calls for an imme-
diate, durable and fully respect-
ed cease-fire, leading to the full
withdrawal of Israeli forces from
Gaza." While the "call" is tanta-
mount to a demand on the parties,
Israel's troops won't be required
to pull out until there is a "dura-
ble" cease-fire.
The resolution calls on U.N.
member states "to intensify
efforts to provide arrangements
and guarantees in Gaza in order
to sustain a durable cease-fire and
calm, including to prevent illicit
trafficking in arms and ammuni-
tion and to ensure the sustained
re-opening" of border crossings.
This is a weaker statement than
Israel sought, and the U.S. would
have liked. There is also no men-
tion in the resolution of an "inter-
national observer force" proposed
by the Arabs - and the word
"Hamas" was dropped during the
negotiations.

Clearing the smoke
Legislature needs to act quickly to approve smoking ban
f you've passed a high school health class, you know smoking
is bad for your health and that secondhand smoke is just as
bad. Armed with that basic knowledge, 35 states have taken
action to prevent the bad habits of some from harming everyone
else breathing the same air. Last spring, Michigan looked like it
would become No. 36 by passing a ban on smoking in public plac-
es. But the state legislature got caught up in the details, and a lot
of fighting and very little action have followed. What we need to
remember is that Michigan stills needs a smoking ban to protect
innocent employees and people from secondhand smoke while

making businesses more welcon
Michigan's fightoverasmokingbanbegan
last Spring. The state Senate and House of
Representatives both passed versions of the
bill as long ago as last May. Those bills dif-
fered slightly, though. The Senate's version
banned smoking in all indoor places. The
House's bill banned smoking in restaurants
and bars but made exceptions for some
establishments like casinos and smoke
shops. Though most -people expected the
two chambers to reach a deal during the
politically secure lame-duck sessions, the
two chambers are still fighting over it seven
months later.
This unacceptable lack of progress has
come at the expense of many people's
health. In public buildings, people often
have little control over whether or not
they are exposed to harmful secondhand
smoke. This is especially true for employ-
ees at restaurants and clearing the smoke
out of public indoor areas is necessary to
protect these people from health risks they
didn't agree to take.
Protecting these people comes with an
economic advantage, too. Contrary to what
many restaurant and bar owners believe,
a smoking ban should actually provide
an economic boost to these businesses.

While the bans may alienate some smok-
ers, smoke-free buildings attract more cus-
tomers who don't want to inhale smoke.
In other states, the non-smokers have out-
weighed the smokers. A study conducted a
year after the smoking ban took effect in
New York, for example, found that tax rev-
enue, demand for liquor licenses and air
quality all increased substantially after the
ban took effect.
Analysts predict that Michigan's smok-
ing-ban legislation will be reintroduced
at the beginning of the legislature's 2009
session and that the two chambers of the
legislature will find one on which they can
agree. If the legislature fails, some have
suggested that a ballot initiative calling for
a smoking ban could be created and put to
a vote in 2010.
There's simply no good reason that a
smoking ban should have to come about via
ballot initiative - the legislature is respon-
sible for making this decision, and the job
shouldn't be passed off to the voters of Mich-
igan. Passing a smoking ban should be an
immediate priority for the 2009 legislative
session, and Michigan state representatives
and senators need to be held accountable for
getting this legislation finished.

Early in his campaign, Barack
Obama introduced a plan
to fund education by partly
delaying funds
for Constellation,
NASA's shuttle
replacement pro-
gram. He justified
the plan by saying
that the U.S. won't
have engineers
and scientists "if
we don't have kids BEN
who are able toC
read, write and CALECA
compute." Due
to the current
financial crisis, budget cuts in many
governmental sectors are inevitable.
But the fact that politicians are quick
to call out NASA as a waste of fed-
eral funds is sad because NASA isn't
just about science fiction or pointless
exploration. NASA is about invest-
ment in newtechnology. It's a surpris-
ingly efficient means of jump-starting
tech-driven industry and making use-
ful discoveries, something that most
people just don't realize.
What has a lot of scientists and
engineers scratching their heads is
that Obama later seemed to counter
his own education funding plan. He
directlycontradicted his earlierstate-
ments when addressing crowds in
Florida and Texas, where NASA cre-
ates thousands of jobs for engineers,
technicians, and service workers.
Obama talked about how the space
program needs funding. In order to
implement the Constellation pro-
gram, which is meant to carry astro-
nauts into space starting in the next
seven years. While it may have been
political pandering, NASA's benefits
require both funding for high profile
missions and the more scientifically
dense, but less publicized programs
such as deep space probes to operate
effectively.
The arguments against NASA

often come from the idea that the
space program is a gigantic waste
of money, which isn't true at all. It's
actually just a drop in the bucket
of the U.S. budget. Its $17.6 billion
budget is less than one percent of
the overall budget, and has never
exceeded four percent in the history
of the U.S. Yet, in polling, the aver-
age American believes a quarter of
all taxes go to NASA programs.
But no matter the cost, NASA's
projects are worth it. For every dol-
lar put into NASA, the technology
has developed returns several times
over in new products in fields ranging
from medicine to sportswear.And the
average American gets to enjoy the
benefits. The sensor systems devel-
oped for the over-budget Hubble
Space Telescope are what allow you
to document your night on the town
with your digital camera. The expen-
sive corrections made to the Hubble
when it was found to be flawed turned
out to be a boon for medical imaging
systems, giving doctors the ability to
detect cancers extremely early and
saving countless lives a year.
Of course, there are two big ques-
tions that always end up being asked:
why not directly invest in medicine,
and why not let the private sec-
tor handle space flight? The truth
is that investing in one specific sci-
ence doesn't always give you the
right answers. We fund medicine, we
fund other fields, but it's in the cross-
section of these innovations that the
most creative solutions to our prob-
lems are found. Diversity of thought
and experience generates more over-
all knowledge and{ valuable lessons
are learned even when the projects
fail.
Private industry can't be counted
on to invest in things that won't turn
animmediateprofit.Whilecompanies
like SpaceX that make space flight a
private business venture are great for
the field, raising capital for an indus-

try with as much risk as space flight
is difficult at best. Some investors
in private space flight, such as Paul
Allen, are only doing so because of
their personal love of the field. NASA
and other programs like it worldwide
need funding to cover the hard sci-
ence from which only governments
can realize a tangible benefit.
It's partly true that NASA has some
issues, with the Space Shuttle being
a prime example. It was meant to be
reusable, cheaper and safer than tra-
ditional rockets, but repeated use has
proven it's anything but that. Both
government and public support keeps
the program going while replace-
ments such as the VentureStar pro-
gram were canned for being a waste
of resources.
It's wrong to deem
NASA a waste of
federal funds.
Our space program's problems
stem from equal parts funding and
oversight. Instead of lavishing funds
on high-profile projects and cutting
corners on smaller ones that only
seem to make headlines if they fail,
NASA needs better review of proj-
ects and proper funding to make sure
projects get it right the first time as
much as possible. Smarter leader-
ship has led to the decision to make
the Constellation program one based
on reliable, proven technologies that
save lives and money. With better
accountability and a focused vision
for realistic goals, NASA funding
will remain a wise investment for the
Obama administration.

couple with com-
bined earnings of

past year. Barack Obama will be the
next president. Looking at these top
positions, one thing is clear - the
people holding them are all black.
But something else may be less
apparent: until Barack Obama's vic-
tory on November 4th 2008, the
"leaders" of the U.S. black community
- or at least the most prominent rep-
resentatives - were all entertainers.
The obvious question, then, is what
does this say about society's one-di-
mensional perception of the African
American community?
In the U.S., the arenas of comedy,
music and sports are hard to imag-
ine without African Americans on
the front lines. For as long a time as
blacks could perform publicly in the
U.S., we have seen African Ameri-
cans as essential to the progression
of entertainment. In a Harvard Uni-
versity Institute of Politics forum
on Race and the Media, Stanley
Crouch spoke of a time when blacks
helped revitalize entertainment, say-
ing: "The tragedy is this: when the
negroid came into minstrelsy it was

on the way out, but these black people
were such good singers, so funny, and
sang so well that they reinvigorated
minstrelsy."
There has certainly been progress
for African-American civil rights
over the course of the last fifty years,
but today, entertainment is still the
only place where stereotypical black-
ness is accepted. In entertainment,
it's okay for blacks to be thugs, pimps
or hypersexual beings. But when
African Americans step out of the
entertainment paradigm and into
white America, it's not okay anymore.
Blackness is okay in music videos,
standup comedy, and football fields,
but African Americans who "wear"
their blackness in the real world will
have a harder time climbing the lad-
der of success.
In 2007, a Washington Post article
titled "Parents and School Tangle
Over Waldorf Tot's Locks" told of a
three-year-old boy being suspended
indefinitely from a private school
because of his dreadlocks. In a 2008
TheRoot.com article called "The Per-
ilous Politics of Hair," Grace Salvant,
a former Ruby Tuesday's employee,
wrote that she could not be rehired at
the restaurant because ithad changed
its policy and would no longer hire
people with braids, dreads, or twists.
While Lil' Wayne may don his dread-
locks without impunity, others whose
primary job is not to entertain are not
so fortunate. This is what happens to
African Americans who "wear" their
blackness.
This image discrepancy mat-
ters, because limiting blackness to
the field of entertainment is a way
of undermining black identity. In
less progressive times, blacks found

entertainment as a niche in which
they could be both black and success-
ful. But today, simultaneously deny-
ing blackness in the corporate world
and endorsing it only in the enter-
tainment field keeps African Ameri-
cans firmly held in a delegitimizing
social paradigm.
Kobe, Beyonce,
Jay-Z ... and
Barack?
At the same time, African Ameri-
cans should continue to arrive at
their own definition of blackness
without submitting to stereotypical
images, even if these images are the
ones that sell records.;Figures repre-
senting the black community'- like
Lil' Wayne - need to be conscious of
the fact that embracing these stereo-
types might bring them success but it
won't shatter the social inequalities
that relegate them to the entertain-
ment business.
And while President-elect Barack
Obama represents a stereotype-de-
fying, prominent image of blackness,
it's not in the African-American com-
munity's interest to simply inherit
another rigid definition. True prog-
ress will only have been made when '
blacks aren't just accurately repre-
sented, but the vast diversity inher-
ent in black culture is also portrayed.

Two discs prove
to be too many on
Soundtrack's latest

By DAVID RIVA
Daily Arts Writer
From the opening riffs
of Communion, one thing is
brutally obvious: The Sound-

Its vin-
tage, clas- of our Lives

it from
most contemporary bands.
Some might consider the
style outdated, appealing
only on long-play recordings
and in sports arenas, but in
TSOOL's case, maintaining
a similar sound to its prede-
cessors is an integral part of
its identity. Its anachronis-
tic music is like an endless
tribute to the forefathers of
rock'n'roll.
On Communion, a two-
disc offering, TSOOL
continues to wear its influ-
ences on its sleeve. South-
ern rock is channeled
through the album's first
single "Thrill Me," which
displays a driving melody
reminiscent of ZZ Top and
accompanied by lead singer
Ebbot Lundberg's growling
shout. "Fly" follows, and it
immediately contrasts its
predecessor, opening with
a folk-rock guitar line that
reeks of counter-culture
hippie-ism. The '60s vibe is
brought full circle through
feeble vocals, with lines

like "Please / give me sec-
ond grace." A robust horn
section provides a full, ele-
vating sound that gives the
song a soaring quality that
aptly fulfills its title.
But with every success-
ful reproduction of classic
rock glory comes an equal
failure. "Just A Brother"
experiments with one too
many instruments and
jumbled synth drones,
none of which produce
any discernible melody. It
comes out like '70s prog
gone wrong (if prog were
ever right in the first place).
"Distorted Child" is a mud-
dled mess of disfigured

"Don't worry / Stop hurry-
ing / Get on with your life /
It's not too late," shows Lun-
dberg's knack for sporadic
one-liners. On the whole,
however, Communion is
much more notable for its
music than its lyrics.
At an exhausting 24
songs, Communion's length
is questionable, especially
when considering tracks
like "Digitarian River-

number that exhibits solid
musicianship but adds

superstars' faces are recogniz-
able worldwide. Some effects
are misses - the 80-year-old
incarnation of Benjamin But-
ton is eerily Gollum-like - but,
for the most part, the effects
are believable.
Aside from the visual effects,
the most engaging element of
"Button" is, unsurprisingly,
leading man Pitt. Primar-
ily known for his heartthrob
appearance, Pitt spends a sig-
nificant part of the film looking
less than beautiful. But as the
audience comes to discover, it's
really only Button's body that
changes significantly over time,
not his demeanor. Pitt plays
Button as the eternal optimist,
whether seven or 70. Pitt's eyes
shine whimsically through the
CGI effects, showing how But-
ton's outsider appearance has
little to do with who his real
character is.
"Button" also benefits from
a gifted supporting cast. One
standout is Taraji P. Henson
("Smokin' Aces"), as Queenie, a
servant at a nursing home who
takes in the abandoned But-
ton and raises him as her own.
Henson's loving portrayal of

a woman who believes in the
power of fate reveals an endur-
ing theme of the film: Even
though Button's fate is set - he
can't change how he ages - he
still aims to live every moment
to its fullest.
Perhaps the most interesting
aspect of this re-imagined ver-
sion of Fitzgerald's story is the
interactions between the char-
acters and the time periods in
which they live. There would
have been no way for Fitzger-
ald to predict the trends of the
'50s, '60s and beyond, but the
film provides apt depictions of
the changing eras. It's fasci-
nating to see how a character
engineered in the '20s func-
tions in a more modern society,
and Fincher is able to create a
world and circumstance that
allows Button to remain true to
his most endearing quality: his
love for life.
"Button" isn't perfect. The
length alone is more than
enough to deter many casual
moviegoers, but it is certainly
one of the all-around best-
produced films of 2008. Its
message is hopeful, its story
is touching and, like Button's
own life, its ending is surpris-
ingly satisfying.

Best of A2 hit the Pig

If you pay any attention to the

already know
about this con- The Hard

Ann Arbor favor-
ites, My Dear Disco and The Hard
Lessons, in what is sure to be a
standout weekend of shows.
My Dear Disco is a solid staple of
the local music scene, well-recog-
nized around campus for playing
at student events like the Groove
show. The band's energetic perfor-
mances and unique sound make it a
crowd-pleaser for fans of all genres.
And don't be put off by the name;
this Disco is less Travolta in tight
white bell-bottoms and more indie
rockstar in a spacesuit.
Front woman Michelle Cha-
muel's smooth vocals blend seam-

lessly with endless layers of electric
guitar and keyboards atop perfectly
orchestrated beatsthatmake ithard
to resist hitting the dance floor. The
nod to retro disco style gives MDD's
sound an ironically modern feel.
And while it's hard to serve up disco
sans cheesiness, through MDD's
synth and percussion shines a soul
that only the passion of real musi-
cians could pull out of electronic
dance tunes.
2008 brought MDD's Dance-
think LP which included fleshed-
out tracks from the band's earlier,
shorterEP.The fresh material bodes
well for the upcoming concert and
should allow the band to serve up a
good mix of old and new.
The Hard Lessons isaband worth
bravingthe cold for in its own right.
Though sporting decidedly differ-
ent sounds, the two bands share one
thing in common: glossy, high-ener-
gylive performances that transcend
the power of the music itself.
The Hard Lessons also pull
from the past, blending classic
rock structure with a post-punk
edge and an indie mindset. Similar
in sound to fellow Detroiters The
White Stripes, The Hard Lessons
maintain melody at a hard-rocking
level. Offeringboth male and female
leads, the strong, brazen vocals

match aggressive guitar and throb-
bing drums on the band's standout
songs like "Wicked Man." Others,
like "It Bleeds," break the madness
for glimpses into the band's softer
side. The chemistry between new-
lyweds Augie Visocchi and Korin
Cox is obvious from the beginning
to the end of any gig they play.

greatness). Last year, the Lessons
dropped B&G Sides, a four-disc set.
Because the band's repertoire is so
varied, its live performances are not
only exhilarating, but also consis-
tently interesting.
Whether you're into the glitz and
glam of MDD, the gritty substance
of The Hard Lessons or just looking
for some quality entertainment the
first weekend after classes started,
check into the Blind Pig to catch
this double dose of local flavor.

Prayer marathon begins

Christian groups
offer round-the-
clock prayer rooms
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
When LSA junior Julia Rod-
gers first arrived on campus her
freshman year, her outlook was
dim. Coping with an eating dis-
order and bouts of depression,
Rodgers wasn't sure how she
was going to make it through
the semester. Her friends urged
her to participate in 40 Days of
Prayer, and although she was
resistant at first, she ultimately
relented.
For Rodgers, the decision
to participate in the event and
become a Christian was life
changing.
"I experienced a freedom in
knowing that I am loved not for
what I do or don't do, but for who
I am," she said. "I experience
more grace in my failures rather
than constant shame."
Tonight at 10 p.m. Christian
groups from across campus will
kick off 40 Days of Prayer, the
same event Rodgers attended
two years ago, at the University
Lutheran Chapel on Washtenaw
Avenue.

Following the celebration,
which will feature performances
from local Christian bands, there
will be a prayer room available
all day and night for the next 40
days for anyone to come in and
pray.
LSA junior Katie Fox, ohe of
the event's central organizers,
said every week will feature a
new theme to help guide partici-
pants' prayers.
"There will be a theme every
week for people to pray for.
Themes include spiritual war-
fare, God's love and prayer as a
lifestyle," she said. '
EngineeringseniorCraigSpen-
cer, another one of the event's
organizers, said this year's event
will unite a record number of
campus Christian groups.
"We have 20 different groups
officially sponsoring and four
other groups participating in the
event," he said. "It's an unprece-
dented gathering of Christians on
campus. I don't know of anything
like it past or present that goes on
like this. To have more than 20
groups represented in one loca-
tion is very empowering."
Spencer said University alumni
Jeff Chin and Phil Michael came
up with the idea for 40 Days of
Prayer in 2007 when they were
still students.
"Their whole idea was, one, to

see people praying and two, to see
Christians united on campus,"
Spencer said. "It started with
two guys who had a plan, who
had a vision and ran with it."
Business sophomore Zachary
White, another event organizer,
said the main goal of the prayer
marathon is to unite campus
Christian groups and students
through prayer.
"Ultimately, our mission is
for people's lives to be changed
through Christ," he said. "We
hope that Christians can grow
closer in their relationship with
God through prayer and that
non-Christians can not only see
but also experience the differ-
ence in their life with having a
relationship with Jesus Christ
based in prayer."
Spencer said he hopes that
the event will help students see
prayer in a new light.
"Many believe that prayer can
be a very boring thing, that it's
just a commitment, something
that you have to do to be a Chris-
tian," Spencer said. "But prayer
can also be very exciting, very
high energy, that allows for many
miraculous things to happen. It's
intriguing and a really amazing
part of the Christian walk."
Spencer said that while some
might expect a 40-day prayer
event to occur during Lent - the

tonight
forty day period before Easter
which is often observed with
prayer and fasting - the begin-
ning of the semester is the per-
fect time for an event like this on
campus.
"Going from January to Feb-
ruary allows us to get 40 days
where people aren't quite as busy
with finals and papers and also
allows us to have 40 straight days
without any major breaks," Spen-
cer said.
Fox said using the prayer room
was a life-altering experience for
her.
"The prayer room holds a spe-
cial place in my heart because
my freshman year it was the
first place I ever truly experi-
enced God," Fox said. "We want
to see the lives of every person
who walks into the prayer room
changed as our lives have been
changed by the room. That is why
we continue to keep the prayer
room alive."
Fox added that she has heard
others talk about the room's
transformative power.
"I have seen the changes that
the prayer room creates in peo-
ple's lives," Fox said. "While most
of the people that come to the
prayer room are believers; their
lives are often changed through-
out the 40 days as their relation-
ship with God is deepened."

Incoming Panhellenic Association President Rachael Reeves said she will focus on
improving relationships between different Greek councils on campus during her term.

Conyers opposes Gupta nomination

 Detroit rep. says
choice lacks needed
experience for post
WASHINGTON (AP) - A key
Democratic House member is
rallying opposition to Dr. Sanjay
Gupta becoming the next sur-
geon general, contending the
39-year-old CNN correspondent
lacks experience.
GAZA VIGIL
From Page 1
Peaceworks at the vigil because
she thinks the current U.S. posi-
tion in the conflict is the wrong
one "regardless of whether or not
you view Israel as an oppressor."
"At this point, I'm just out here
supporting a middle ground," she
said.
LSA sophomore John Oltean
said he attended the event because
he was appalled by the "cata-
strophic violence" in Gaza.

House Judiciary Commit-
tee Chairman John Conyers,
D-Mich., urged Democrats to
sign onto a letter to President-
elect Barack Obama urging him
not to nominate Gupta, who is
CNN's chief medical correspon-
dent. .
"It is not in the best interests
of the nation to have someone
like this who lacks the requisite
experience needed to oversee
the federal agency that provides

crucial health care assistance
to some of the poorest and most
underserved communities in
America," Conyers wrote in a let-
ter released Thursday.
Obama has approached Gupta
to become the next surgeon gen-
eral, the cable network has said.
Obama has not yet announced
his choice for the position, which
typically disseminates public
health information.
Gupta hosts "House Call" on

CNN, contributes reports to
CBS News, and writes a column
for Time magazine. He is a neu-
rosurgeon and on the faculty
at Emory University School of
Medicine in Atlanta. During the
Clinton administration, he was a
White House fellow and special
adviser to then-first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
Gupta is a native of Novi, Mich.,
which is near Conyers' Detroit-
area congressional district.

PANHEL PRESIDENT

LSA junior Stephenie Lazarus,
Panhel's vice president for public

already shown great leadership.
"Rachael has great ideas for

has already approached me with
ideas for next year's recruitment."
Lazarus said. "Also, she has begun

Big House Tanning, where the
flooding originated, re-opened on
Tuesday after suffering extensive
water damage. The business had to

"We need to take a stand against
it," Oltean said. "As a privileged stu-
dentofthe U.S., itismydutytocome
here and represent these people."
About 10 to 15 people demon-
strated in opposition to the event.
Ann Arbor resident Henry Hersk-
ovitz said the candlelight vigil was
not the right message to send.
"My purpose for coming here
is to tell the people holding can-
dles that this is not an appro-
priate response to an, ongoing
genocide," Herskovitz said. "An
appropriate response is to say,
'stop Israeli aggression against an

indigenous population that's basi-
cally unarmed."'
Another person demonstrating
against the vigil, Ann Arbor resi-
dent Michelle Kinnucan, said she
was protesting the United States'
financial, military and diplomatic
backing of Israel.
"It's important to take a stand
against the massacre that's occur-
ring with the full backing of the
United States government," Kin-
nucan said, while standing on an
Israeli flag and waving a flag asso-
ciated with Hamas.
Overall, the vigil attendees

didn't seem bothered by the pres-
ence of the other protestors.
One attendee, Amanda Bow-
man, a sophomore at Eastern
Michigan University, said she
wasn't surprised that.other -dem-.
onstrators showed up.
"I kind of expected it. I don't
really feel threatened," she said.
Groups sponsoring the event
included the Muslim Student
Association of Washtenaw Com-
munity College, Jewish Voice for
Peace, American Jews for a Just
Peace and Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom.

ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
You feel pulled between the demands
of home and family and the demands of
your job or your external world. Don't
try to solve everything. (This is due to
today's Full Moon.)
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
This particular Full Moon is an acci-
dent-prone day for you because it sets up
tension within you and makes you dis-
tracted. Therefore, slow down and do
things carefully.
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
Today's Full Moon makes you feel
pulled between protecting or earning
your own money versus dealing with the
funds of others. You can't ignore your
responsibility to others.
CANCER
(June 21 to July 22)
This is the only Full Moon in your
sign all year. That's why you feel
increased tension when dealing with
partners and close friends. Stay frosty.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Be patient with co-workers today,
because people are extra tense due to
today's Full Moon. Don't sayIhetirst
thing that comes to mind. Think before
you speak.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
Today's Full Moon might make you
quick to criticize or oppose friends and
groups. You're not sure which side of the
fence tobe on.
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
This is spoor day to deal with bosses,
parents, teachers, VIPs and the police.
You won't be able to keep everyone
happy. Be cool.

SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
Be careful. This is an accident-prone
day because of the Full Moon. If you
slow down and are aware of what you
say and do, nothing has to happen.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22to Dec. 21)
Tension about finances or cash flow
could arise because of today's Full
Moon. If you can postpone a decision
about money and possessions, do so.
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22to Jan. 19)
Today is the only Full Moon opposite
your sign all year: In fact, you're part of
the formula! This means you have to be
extra patient with loved ones and part-
ners.
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20to Feb. 18)
Because you're restless and impatient
today, your dealings with co-workers or
medical people could go awry or be mis-
understood. Relax; just cool your jets
and keep smiling.
PISCES
(Feb. 19 to March 20)
Tension with groups or casual
acquaintances and friends might arise
because of today's Full Moon. Ask your-
self Am I part of the problem or part of
Ike solution?
YOU BORN TODAY You're amaz-
ingly tough and resilient. When others
have long given up, you continue to per-
severe and succeed in attaining your
goals. You're a practical realist. You
don't kid yourself. You do your home-
work. You easily assume leadership or
you can work in partnership-with others.
You often hide your true feelings behind
amask. This yearyumurk hard to build
or construct something important.

earlier hopes that an economic
recovery package could be passed
by both houses before Obama's
inauguration, leaders of both polit-
ical parties doubt if that goal is fea-
sible.
During an appearance on NBC's
Meet' the Press Sunday, Sen-
ate Majority Leader Harry Reid
(D-Nev.) didn't give a clear time-
table for the passage of a stimulus
package.
Democratic party leaders,
including Senate Budget Com-
mittee chairman Kent Conrad
(D-N.D.), are confident that an
economic recovery package of
some kind will be drafted and
approved by Feb.16.
One issue that may stall the
plan is Obama's scramble to find
someone to serve as secretary of
commerce. Obama's initial pick
for the position, former New
Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson,
withdrew his name from con-
sideration last week due to an
ethics investigation into busi-
ness conducted by the state of
New Mexico when he was gov-
ernor.
Richardson has denied any
wrongdoing in the case but
withdrew because the investi-
gation would delay his confir-
mation hearings.
In addition to complicating
Obama's plan to get an eco-
nomic stimulus package up and
running as quickly as possible,
the scramble to find a replace-
ment may allow Congressional
Republicans the time to build
a stronger coalition against the
stimulus package.
There has already been
strong opposition to large-tale,
federally funded infrastructure
improvements by Republicans
in the House and Senate, even
those plans which would leave
the spending of federal funds
up to the discretion of state and
local governments.
However, in his speech yes-
terday Obama responded to
these concerns, saying that
while the cost of his plan will be
"considerable," the consequenc-
es of doing nothing "will lead to
an even greater deficit of jobs,
incomes and confidence jn our
economy."

And the RedHawks (10-2-2-1,

No. 8 Miami still sits comfort-

But with the main parts of the
Wolverines' game meshing, Mich-
igan is primed for a second-half
surge. That starts tonight with
Miami, and the outcome could set

the tone for a series showdown

Sims proved he
was Michigan's best threat in the
post, Beilein decided to switch up
the lineup.
Now, Sims is one of the Wolver-
ines' most consistent starters -
and Wright has played just three
minutes in the last six games.
Even with Sims emerging as

a solid starter, Beilein continues
to juggle the starting five. Michi-
gan (2-1 Big Ten, 12-3 overall) has
employed a different combination
of starters in each of its last four
games.
Ten Wolverines have started
this season. Sophomore forward
Manny Harris is the only player
to be in Michigan's top five every
game.
Beilein attributes much of the
shuffling to his effort to find other
scoring threats to complement
Harris and Sims.
"We're still searching to find out
who is our 'other guy' out there,"
Beilein said.
Harris averages 18.7 points per
game but has been held in check in
Michigan's three Big Ten contests,
averaging about five fewer points
per game.
"That man has a bullseye on his
chest every time he comes out,"
fifth-year senior C.J. Lee said.
"He's getting the best defenders in
the conference every night."
In Big Ten play, Harris has often
forced shots and is committing

an average of four turnovers per
game.
But with Harris's lesser impact
on the scoreboard, Michigan's role
players have stepped up.
"[My shots] haven't been fall-
ing," Harris said. "I've continued
to work on it and it still isn't fall-
ing. ...But teammates like C.J. Lee
and everybody else picked it up."
During Michigan's 72-66 win
over Indiana Wednesday, Lee and
redshirt freshman guard Laval
Lucas-Perry were the difference-
makers for the Wolverines.
Lee came off the bench and hit
two key 3-pointers in the last 1
minutes that helped Michigan
overcome a 20-point deficit.
"(His shots) were the changing
point to me," Harris said Wednes-
day night. "We could've laid down.
You got to have balls to take that
shot, and C.J (Lee) had them
tonight."
And Lee isn't the only under-
the-radar player stepping up for
the Wolverines.
Junior forward Zack Gibson-
played his best game of the season

against Illinois last Sunday by put-
ting up 10 points, including two big
momentum-turning dunks.
In Michigan's loss to Wiscon-
sin on Dec. 31, freshman guard
Zach Novak was the lone bright
spot for the Wolverines, pouring
in a career-high 20 points. Novak
earned a spot in the starting lineup
and then played a team-high 42
minutes against Indiana.
With so many role players step-
ping up, it has been difficult for
Beilein to cement his starting
lineup.
And the mixed combinations
haven't helped Michigan in con-
ference play - the Wolverines
have not led at halftime in any of
their Big Ten games.
Against Indiana, Michigan
went to the locker room down by
17 at halftime. Beilein encouraged
his players to keep their poise
and the Wolverines eventually
triumphed. For Sunday's game
against Iowa (1-2, 11-5), Beilein
will need to evaluate all of his past
lineup combinations in an attempt
to create the perfect starting five.

Tim Tebow adds to
illustrious collegiate
career with ten-point
Florida victory
By BEN WALKER
Associated PressSports Writer
MIAMI (AP) - Tim Tebow gave
Florida the jolt it needed, and the
Gators toughed out a second BCS
title in three years.
Their 24-14 win over No. 2 Okla-
homa in a choppy, sloppy affair
Thursdaynightmade themanation-
al champion. But it likely did littleto
quiet fans of Southern California,
Utah and Texas, allof whom already
claimed the top spot.
The high-scoring shootout
between Heisman Trophy winners
never materialized. Oklahoma's
Sam Bradford couldn't score from
in close and Tebow threw two inter-
ceptions, as many as he had all sea-
son.
, Tebow, however, shook off two
miserable throws to rescue the top-
ranked Gators (13-1). He drove them
to the clinching score - he took two
hard steps toward the line, jumped
and zipped a 4-yard touchdown
pass to David'Nelson with 3:07 to
make it 24-14.
Percy Harvin returned from an
ankle injury and dashed for 122
yards on only nine carries. His
52-yard gallop set up Jonathan Phil-
lips' 27-yard field goal early in the
fourth quarter for a 17-14 lead.
Tebow added to the title he
helped the Gators win in 2006 with
a rout of Ohio State and, one season
after winningthe Heisman, brought
home another trophy.
"Tebow, just call him Superman,"
Harvin said.
National chomps, indeed!
The Associated Press will release
its final poll early Friday morning.
Tebow was picked the game's
most outstanding player, running
for 109 yards. His passing wasn't
so precise - 18-for-30 - yet it was
his sheer will that kept coach Urban
Meyer's team going.
It was the third straight national
title for a team from the Southeast-
ern Conference, and marked the
Sooners' fifth straight loss in a BCS
game. Oklahoma (12-2) set a mod-
ern record for scoring this season
and put up at least 60 points in its
last five games, yet never found its
rhythm.
Bradford, who beat out Tebow for
the Heisman, was a disappointing
26-for-41 with two interceptions.
Like Tebow, he's going to explore
his potential for the NFL draft -
not exactly the performance he
wanted.
Tebow struggled throughout
the first half, his lone highlight a
20-yard touchdown pass to Louis
Murphy for a 7-0 lead early in the
second quarter. Bradford came right
back with a swift 65-yard drive,
capped by his 6-yard TD toss to Jer-

maine Gresham.
Florida's defense, rather than
Tebow, Harvin and its speedsters
on the other side of the ball, kept the
Gators close.
Poised to break the tie midway
through the second quarter, Okla-
homa owned a first-and-goal at
the 9.
Chris Browncarried four straight
times and the Gators stood up the
1,100-yard rusher, twice stuffing
him from the 1.
Rarely turned back in the red
zone this season, the Sooners let it
happen to them again in the final
minute before halftime.
There were 10 seconds left and
Oklahoma was out of timeouts when
Bradford dropped back from the 6.
He tried to hit Manuel Johnson at
the goal line, but the pass deflected
off him and the Gators rana perfect
tip drill, with three defenderstouch-
ingtheballbefore MajorWrighthad
the interception.
Tebow, meanwhile, kept stopping
the Gators.
The interceptions were bad picks,
too - Tebow telegraphed a long,
cross-field throw that Nic Har-
ris easily grabbed and later made a
short flip over the middle right to
Gerald McCoy.
Were the Gators out of whack?
Hard to tell, though offensive coor-
dinator Dan Mullen certainly had
a lot to think about. Hired recently
by Mississippi State, he becomes the
Bulldogs' full-time head coach Fri-
day.
Both teams seemed to have trou-
ble with the game officials. The crew
kept interrupting play for various
reasons, and the result was a sloppy,
scoreless first quarter.
Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops and
Meyer took turns hollering at ACC
referee Ron Cherry, as if to tell him
"Let'em play!"
Florida linebacker Brandon
Spikes was equally vocal. A few days
after calling Big12 defenses "a joke,"
he got into a couple of early shout-
ing and shoving skirmishes with
the Sooners. It was even a bit edgy
before the game - warming up in
the end zone, an Oklahoma kicker
rolled his eyes when two Gators
leaned against the goal post right
behind him.
Tebow, naturally, came out
charged up.
He got off the team bus, walked
over to a clutch of Florida fans,
waved his arms and then ripped off
his tie and threw it into a bunch of
tailgaters - tail-Gators, in this case.
By the time Tebow trotted out for
warmups, most of the Gators were
already kneeling along the goal line
to stretch. Tebow walked up and
down the line, slapping hands and
backsides of all 90-some players.

ANNA BAKEMAN/Daily
Sophomore guard Veronica Hicks scored 10 second-half points in Michigan's win.

notched more playing time than
the Wolverines' other post pres-
ence, senior Stephany Skrba, and
Phillips's size in the middle helped
Michigan lock down Smith in the
paint.
If the Wolverines hope to dictate
post play in their next two games
against Wisconsin and Michigan
State, Phillips's six-and-a-half-foot

stature could be essential, espe-
cially against All-Big Ten Michi-
gan State center Allyssa DeHaan.
And if the Wolverines hope to
silence their road demons this Sun-
day against Wisconsin, it'll take an
aggressiveness from Hicks and the
rest of the Michigan squad that the
team has previously lacked away
from home.
