Though 
the 
presidential 

election has drawn a lot of the 
focus on campus, local elections 
are ramping up in the building 
to Nov. 8 as well.

The 
Washtenaw 
County 

sheriff’s 
race 
between 

incumbent 
Sheriff 
Jerry 

Clayton (D), who has now 
served two four-year terms, and 
Ken Magee (R) will culminate 
with residents casting their 
votes on Election Day.

Clayton previously served 

in the sheriff’s office for 20 
years prior to retiring in 2006. 
He served as the Washtenaw 
County Jail administrator, a 

corrections officer, a deputy 
sheriff and in several other law 
enforcement positions in the 
county.

Magee was a part of U.S. 

Drug Enforcement Agency for 
24 years, where he worked on 
the Pablo Escobar case — a 
high-profile drug trafficking 
investigation — and served as a 
DEA unit chief in Washington, 
D.C. He also served as the 
University of Michigan police 
chief for three years before 
resigning 
in 
2011 
after 
a 

12-month sick leave.

Addressing mental health 

and substance abuse in the 
county

Mental health and substance 

abuse are priorities for both 

aThe 
University 
of 

Michigan’s Central Student 
Government 
officially 

launched its new “It Starts 
With Me” initiative Tuesday 
to 
bring 
issues 
around 

discrimination 
on 
campus 

into the spotlight.

CSG Vice President Micah 

Griggs, an LSA senior, is 
leading the campaign, which 
will last through the academic 
year.

The initiative was initially 

kicked off this past Tuesday 
during CSG Diag Day. Griggs 
said the campaign originally 
stemmed 
from 
the 
anti-

Black, anti-Muslim and anti-
LGBTQ posters seen around 
campus several weeks ago but 
has since taken a proactive 
approach to raising awareness 
about these issues in the 
campus community.

CSG 
members 
are 

launching the “It Starts With 
Me” campaign by reaching 
out to student organizations 
on 
campus 
to 
sign 
its 

banner. According to Griggs, 
the 
banner, 
symbolizing 

solidarity for the cause, was 
first revealed at the Diag day 
but will now be circulating 
each week to a different 
student organization.

“We really just wanted 

to call in students to be an 
ally through their actions, 
and it can just be something 

symbolic like signing a poster 
but also to bring awareness 
to 
these 
issues,” 
Griggs 

said. “Sometimes events on 
campus occur and students 
just brush them under the rug 
or they forget about it, but 
communities are hurting.”

CSG 
Communications 

Director Joe Shea, a Public 
Policy 
senior, 
said 
each 

student holds an individual 
responsibility as a part of the 

University community.

“It’s an introspective thing 

— it starts with you, it starts 
with me, personally,” Shea 
said. “In order to change 
on-campus apathy, we need 
to do it on an individual level, 
and once we get there, we are 
excited to build on that.”

In 
addition 
to 
signing 

the banner, Griggs said the 
campaign will pass out blue 
wristbands 
displaying 
“It 

Starts With Me.” Both the 
banner and wristbands will 
allow students to recognize 
other allies around campus 
and 
hold 
one 
another 

responsible to the promise 
they’ve made toward creating 
a more inclusive community.

“When events happen on 

campus, we aren’t always 
taking a reactive motion to 
these things,” Griggs said. 

The University of Michigan 

is working to cut the number 
of 
opioid 
addictions 
that 

result 
from 
post-surgical 

opioid prescriptions, which 
make up 40 percent of opioid 
painkillers prescribed overall 
in Michigan.

Researchers 
have 
found 

that about one in 10 patients 
who are prescribed opioid 
painkillers 
post-surgery 

become dependent on them. 
To counter this statistic, as 
well as an overall high number 
of prescriptions being given 
out, the University is working 
alongside 
the 
Michigan 

Department of Health and 
Human Services to create the 
Michigan Opioid Prescribing 
Engagement Network.

The 
Michigan-OPEN 

initiative 
is 
being 
funded 

with a $1.4 million per year, 
five-year grant from the state 
and equal funding from the 
University with a goal to cut 
in half both the number of 
opioids prescribed to post-
surgery 
patients 
and

Dr. John Garcia, a research professor emeritus at the Institute for Social Research, speaks at the “Latinas/os and the 2016 Election” forum at North Quad Thursday.

With the election rapidly 

approaching, about 20 people 
gathered Thursday in North 
Quad to listen to three panelists 
explain what Latinos can do to 
mobilize in response to Donald 

Trump’s campaign.

Panelists also discussed how 

the community can engage 
with policy debates regarding 
immigration, 
using 
various 

studies and statistics.

“Latinas/os and the 2016 

Election,” 
was 
the 
second 

forum in a series of five, 
organized 
by 
the 
Latina/o 

Studies Program this year with 
the aim of creating a space 
where faculty, students and 
the Ann Arbor community can 
come together with speakers 
from 
outside 
organizations 

to discuss a range of issues 
most pertinent to the Latino 
community.

The 
panel’s 
participants 

included 
John 
García, 
a 

research 
professor 
emeritus 

with the Institute for Social 
Research, 
Political 
Science

number of patients who still 
used the opioids many months 
after the surgery took place. 
Michigan-OPEN will attempt 
to meet this goal by educating 
surgical teams about opioid 
use.

In 
a 
statement, 
Chad 

Brummett, director of the 
Division of Pain Research 
in the UM Department of 
Anesthesiology and a leading 
member of Michigan-OPEN, 
said 
the 
initiative 
would 

surmount 
the 
troubling 

number 
of 
painkillers 

prescribed by surgeons by 
giving them the resources 
they needed.

“Surgeons 
prescribe 

nearly 40 percent of opioid 
painkillers in Michigan, but 
have few resources to guide 
them on best use of the drugs 
by patients before and after 
surgery,” 
Brummett 
said. 

“We hope that by working 
with surgical teams across 
the state, we can fill that gap 

for the benefit of individual 
patients and our state as a 
whole.”

Several medical students 

have also worked on this 
initiative. 
Ryan 
Howard, 

a 
fourth-year 
medical 

student who took charge of a 
project specific to reducing 
prescriptions after gallbladder 
surgery, said he thought the 
initiative was imperative and 
surgeons especially had a 
greater responsibility in it.

“I think this is really critical 

work right now,” Howard said. 
“In Michigan, more people die 
from opioid overdose than 
from 
car 
accidents. 
Since 

surgeons prescribe roughly 40 
percent of the opioids in the 
community, they have a huge 
opportunity to help address 
this issue. What we’re trying 
to do at UM is model a way to 
really comprehensively make a 
difference in the safety of our 
patients and our community 
as a whole.”

Michigan-OPEN is being 

coordinated 
alongside 
12 

Blue 
Cross 
Blue 
Shield 

Michigan 
Collaborative 

Quality 
Initiatives. 
These 

CQIs are composed of medical 
professionals and hospitals 
throughout 
Michigan 
that 

work together to improve 
surgical care.

Together, 
Michigan-

OPEN and the CQIs will 
create guidelines for surgical 
professionals, such as primary 
care and specialty physicians 
who treat surgical patients. 
These 
guidelines 
include 

tactics for hospitals to deal 
with patients and health care 
providers.

The 
Michigan-OPEN 

initiative 
will 
also 
put 

a 
special 
emphasis 
on 

Medicaid patients. While this 
demographic only accounts 
for 12 percent of surgical 
patients in the state, it makes 
up 30 percent of people who 
become dependent on opioid 
painkillers after surgery.

Along with the effort to 

prevent post-surgery opioid 
addiction, 
Michigan-OPEN 

additionally plans to focus 
on patients who were already 
taking 
prescription 
opioid 

painkillers before they had 
surgery.

Additionally, the University 

has also created a guide for 
organizing opioid take-
back 
events. 
Typically, 

pills can only be disposed 
of at government agencies 
like police stations. These 
take-back events, which 
have 
interactive 
maps 

to direct people to the 
nearest 
locations, 
have 

proven to be effective — 
one event in Ann Arbor 
collected 
approximately 

89,500 
pills, 
most 
of 

which 
were 
prescribed 

post-surgery.

Howard, who also ran a 

project to increase access 
of locations to dispose 
of leftover opioid pills, 
stressed the uncertainty 
patients had about where 
they should dispose of 
their medication.

“Many of the patients 

we spoke with knew it was 
dangerous to have leftover 
medication lying around, 
but they simply didn’t 
know where to take it,” he 
said.

candidates. Clayton has stated 
plans to sustain and expand 
current mental health-related 
programs, while Magee says 
he wants to target substance 
abuse and addiction with a 
new program. If elected, both 
candidates 
have 
prioritized 

addressing mental health issues 
in the community.

In an interview, Clayton said 

he plans to continue his office’s 
relationship with Washtenaw 
County 
Community 
Mental 

Health, a local government-
affiliated group that provides 
services to those with mental 
disabilities.

The sheriff’s office currently 

collaborates with the WCCMH 
through the Community Mental 
Health 
Response 
Program. 

Staff members from both units 
co-teach a course to educate first 
responders on mental health 
crises and the appropriate way 
to act in such an event. Clayton 
said if elected, he will push to 
expand the initiative to other 
law enforcement agencies in the 
county.

He also said his team plans 

to continue working closely 
with other groups to improve 
mental health and engage the 
community through a variety of 
collective efforts.

“We’re working with a lot 

with 
of 
the 
mental 
health 

professionals 
and 
grassroots 

folks first, NAMI — National 
Alliance on Mental Illness — and 
the two health care systems, to 
really talk about a comprehensive 
approach for addressing mental 
health crises here in our county,” 
he said. “It’s a major initiative we 
will continue to work on.”

Speaking to reducing the 

fatal effects of substance abuse, 
Clayton said he plans to continue 
addressing the county’s opioid 
issue firsthand with naloxone — 
a medication that counters the 
effects of opioids in the event 
of an overdose — noting that 
the sheriff’s office was the first 
organization in the county to 
administer the medication.

“As far as the opioid issue, 

we’ve been leaders on that since 
last year,” he said. “We’re going 
to have our best efforts in our 
prevention, in education and 
supportive recovery. Our move 
toward naloxone is now giving 
them a tool that is proactive, and 
that has, quite frankly, saved 
lives.”

Clayton said 33 people are 

alive today and able to rejoin the 
community because of his staff’s 
appropriate administration of 
naloxone.

“They might not be ready, but 

when they are, they’re alive now 
and they have potential to be a 
contributing member of society,” 
he said.

Magee 
has 
similarily 

prioritized mental health during 
his campaign, viewing it in 
conjunction 
with 
substance 

abuse. 
Combating 
the 
local 

heroin epidemic has been at the 
forefront of his campaign, and he 
cited it as the number one public 
health and public safety crisis in 
the community.

If elected, Magee plans to 

institute a program he developed 
called PETER — Prevention, 
Enforcement, 
Treatment, 

Education and Recovery.

A large part of this initiative, 

according to Magee, is spreading 
awareness to the community 
about issues related to substance 
abuse.

“I want my deputies involved 

in 
the 
community 
from 
a 

preventative 
standpoint 
to 

prevent young people from even 
starting drugs, to really continue 
to get the word out there,” 
he said. “Every day, deputies 
on the street should be doing 
something, working with people 
and mentoring.”

Magee 
emphasized 
that 

enforcement 
extends 
beyond 

arrest, 
focusing 
on 
the 

importance of enforcing rules by 
way of “peer-to-peer pressure” 
within the family and within the 
substance abuse community.

He noted that those who 

commit 
crimes 
are 
not 

necessarily criminal, adding that 
low-level offenders often deserve 
to be helped and rehabilitated.

“When people are treated for 

mental health and substance 
abuse issues at the same time, we 
will have a much more successful 
rate of getting people away from 
the deadly disease of addiction,” 
he said.

Magee 
said 
he 
plans 
to 

dedicate his first year’s salary to 
drug treatment and prevention 
programs in the community.

Increasing restorative justice 

initiatives

The two candidates have also 

addressed issues surrounding 
incarceration in the community.

Clayton 
said 
another 

initiative the sheriff’s office 
aims to enhance is LEAD, Law 
Enforcement Assisted Diversion. 
Originally launched in King 
County, Wash., this program 
works to treat and support low-
level offenders at the community 
level, according to its website.

Clayton said this program 

was 
created 
for 
offenders 

who do not pose a risk to the 
community, allowing them to 
avoid unnecessary jail time.

“Say they have some root 

cause issue like substance abuse, 
mental health issues, housing — 
all of those things,” he said. “It’s a 
harm reduction approach, where 
a person has the opportunity to 
enter that system and to get the 
kind of help to stabilize them 
— if they work through, say, an 
addiction or mental health issue 
— as opposed to going to jail.”

Also 
emphasizing 
the 

importance of restorative justice, 
Magee said in conjunction with 
PETER, plans to transform part 
of the jail into a recovery unit, 
pointing to this as a primary 
reason for his decision to run 
for office. He said more than 
80 percent of all crime-related 
activity can be traced back to 
substance abuse issues.

“(The sheriff’s office) gives me 

the most widespread impact that 
I can have,” he said “... Having an 
impact right there at the jail with 
individuals, I can help institute 
programs, and I can help reduce 
the recidivism rate. I can have 
the biggest impact not only on 
people who are suffering from 
the illness of addiction, but also 
impact our community in many 
other ways.”

he performed of Latino voters: 
political trends, development 
among the Latino electorate, 
evolving 
political 
parties, 

the candidates and further 
Latino effect. He said the 
most important aspect of the 
Latino population is that it is 
relatively young and foreign 
born, resulting in only 48 
percent of Latinos voting in 
the last election in contrast 
to 66 percent of white and 
African-American voters.

Though 
García 
noted 

Latinos overwhelmingly align 
with the Democratic Party, 
he explained that only 25 
percent 
believe 
Democrats 

are truly committed to their 
community 
and 
working 

on 
important 
issues 
like 

immigration. 
This 
election 

cycle, 
polls 
show 
Latinos 

are 
much 
more 
dedicated 

to 
stopping 
Trump 
than 

supporting Hillary Clinton. 
Throughout 
the 
campaign, 

Trump has proposed several 
strict immigration policies, 
such as building a wall along 
the U.S.-Mexico border, and 
used controversial rhetoric 
about Latinos .

“What’s the old cliché about 

a house that’s not a home?” 
García 
said. 
“Latinos 
feel 

like the Democratic Party is 
a house, but not necessarily 
their home.”

Nichols 
continued 
the 

conversation by sharing her 
research on whether “threats,” 
both in the form of insults and 
policy, are enough on their 
own to mobilize the Latino 
population to stop Trump. 
She said though many people 
believe that Trump’s rhetoric 
will cause many more Latinos 
to vote, hate alone is not 
enough to motivate people to 
vote. She added that she wants 
people not to cower in fear, but 
rather to feel energetic about 
the prospect of voting.

“The idea is that there may 

be an issue with trying to get 
people to go out and vote, in 
large part because threatening 
may not be enough,” Nichols 
said.

Instead, 
she 
pointed 
to 

the results of her research, 
which found that politicians 
must 
couple 
both 
threat 

and opportunity to inspire 
action. When Latinos were 
shown 
a 
threat 
to 
their 

citizenship, an opportunity 
to gain citizenship and a mix 
of the two — followed by the 
opportunity to send a letter to 
their U.S. senator — 72 percent 

sent the postcard in reaction 
to the mixture of threat and 
opportunity.

Nichols added that Latinas 

spearhead 
community 

organizing efforts and were 
the most likely to reach out to 
both their local and national 
governments.

Ostfeld concluded the panel 

by discussing a study she 
conducted on the effect of the 
mass shift of Latinos to the 
Democrat Party and broader 
patterns of partisanship. She 
found 
that 
as 
Democratic 

outreach 
to 
the 
Latino 

population grows, it is white, 
college-educated voters who 
are shifting in large numbers 
away from voting straight-
ticket Democrat. When the 
white 
study 
participants 

were shown two articles, one 
describing Clinton’s outreach 
to Latino voters and the other 
describing Clinton reaching 
out to undecided voters, they 
were 15 percent less likely to 
vote for Clinton after reading 
the article about her reaching 
out to Latinos.

From this data, Ostfeld 

said it’s clear the mass shift 
of 
Latino 
partisanship 
is 

contributing to a new racial 
realignment of the American 
party system and increasing 
the salience of white identity.

Center for Political Studies, 
said the data is not shocking 
given 
what 
voters 
have 

witnessed in the media and 
during debates.

“The polling data shows 

that we have two of the most 
unpopular candidates ever to 
run in a presidential election,” 
Traugott said. “The general 
tone of the campaign has 
been very negative, shown by 
the fact that the candidates 
didn’t shake hands. We can be 
confident that it’s been quite 
stressful.”

On campus, the University’s 

Counseling and Psychological 
Services has taken notice of the 
climate as well. In response to 
both the political climate and 
the APA’s study, CAPS has 
created services to help handle 
election stress.

Mishelle 
Rodriguez, 

coordinator of social media at 
CAPS, said she noticed from 
both personal experience and 
the APA study that regardless 
of their political affiliations, 
people are stressed.

“This 
year, 
people’s 

experiences 
have 
been 

markedly 
different 
than 

previous 
years,” 
Rodriguez 

said. “I don’t know that ever 
before there has been a need 
for this. We really wanted to 
be proactive and offer students 
events, information and coping 
skills so people felt that we 
were supporting them.”

The APA’s findings indicate 

that both Republicans and 
Democrats 
are 
equally 

stressed. 
The 
study 
also 

shows the two age groups 
experiencing 
the 
most 

stress are matures (71+) and 
millennials (19-37) some of 
whom are voting for the first 
time. Additionally, the study 
indicated that adults who use 
social media experience more 
stress than those who don’t.

Rodriguez said she believes 

social media is a huge factor in 
the mental health of students 
because it can be difficult for 
some individuals to put their 
phones down and disconnect 
when the time calls for it.

“There’s a certain level of 

information that’s good for 
people to make better decisions 
on how they’re going to vote, 
but there is a point where 
you are consuming all this 
information and can’t process 
all of it, so that gives people 
anxiety,” Rodriguez said.

As well, she said social 

media provides a platform 
for discourse in which you 
don’t see the other person 
and 
therefore 
don’t 
face 

repercussions for the things 
you say.

“When 
people 
post 

comments on social media, 
they don’t see how it impacts 

other people, and they have 
anonymity, so they can say 
very 
callous, 
inflammatory 

things without ever having 
to deal with how it impacts 
people,” Rodriguez said.

Staff 
psychologist 
Jamye 

Banks, coordinator of suicide 
prevention at CAPS, said the 
University 
is 
also 
unique 

in that it is such a diverse 
community, which can be yet 
another stressor that students 
have to manage.

“Anxiety is already a major 

issue on this campus because 
of the academics and adding 
the uncertainty of how the 
election will play out adds to 
that,” Banks said. “We have a 
diverse group of people on this 
campus, and not everybody 
has the same idea, and how do 
you then dialogue with people 
on campus who have different 
ideas and perspectives? And 
if you’re a targeted identity 
within all of this, that’s going 
to be more stressful and you’re 
worried about safety.”

For 
Engineering 
junior 

Mazen Oweiss, the type of 
used rhetoric is causing worry 
both for himself and those he 
cares about.

“My mom and some of my 

friends wear a hijab so when 
they go out there and wear it 
on their sleeve, it’s upsetting 
to 
see 
that 
(derogatory 

comments) happen in public,” 
Oweiss said. “It’s upsetting 
and a bit worrying because it 
affects people I care about. 
There’s a general feeling of 
alienation.”

Public Policy junior Ella 

Webb, a member of Students 
for Choice, said she also finds 
it alarming that hate speech 
has become OK throughout the 
election season.

“I 
think 
Trump 
has 

normalized it, and if someone 
who 
is 
in 
a 
position 
of 

power 
is 
promoting 
that 

ideology, people become more 
comfortable 
not 
just 
with 

the comments themself but 
on issues of immigration and 
racism,” Webb said. “I’ve seen 
this kind of rhetoric pick up 
a lot because people are more 
comfortable because they now 
have a figure to back up their 
claims to.”

GOP presidential nominee 

Donald 
Trump 
has 
faced 

criticism over high profile 
incidents 
like 
a 
video 

released in which he makes 
comments about touching a 
woman without her consent, 
prospective 
talk 
from 
the 

candidate on building a wall 
to 
block 
illegal 
Mexican 

immigration and the possibility 
of deporting Muslims.

Traugott 
said 
fear 
of 

becoming or being a minority, 
as well as media coverage, 
contributes to the elevated 
levels of stress people are 
experiencing.

“There 
are 
problems 
of 

whites becoming a minority in 

the United States by the 2040s, 
which is creating anxiety in 
that group,” Traugott said. 
“There are also issues of the 
coverage and the style of 
coverage. Some of it is related 
to the content and revelations 
of 
Trump’s 
behavior 
and 

impudent 
attitudes 
about 

women.”

Traugott 
also 
noted 

Democratic 
presidential 

nominee Hillary Clinton has 
had her share of criticism 
as well from inquiring into 
a private email server she 
used for government work 
and the investigation of the 
Clinton Foundation in regard 
to criminal conflict of interest 
between the foundation and 
the State Department during 
Clinton’s tenure as Secretary 
of State.

“In public policy terms, 

there are a lot of issues 
that 
distinguish 
the 
two 

candidates 
and 
there 
are 

plenty of criticisms of Hillary 
Clinton’s behavior in the past 
and recently with the emails,” 
Traugott said. “But each time 
the GOP campaign tries to 
focus on this fact, Trump 
makes 
some 
outrageous 

statement and the media focus 
on that, which detracts from 
the behavior of Clinton.”

Amid the election season, 

University students have also 
been 
processing 
incidences 

on campus. In September and 
October, multiple anti-Black, 
anti-Muslim and anti-LGBTQ 
fliers 
were 
posted 
around 

campus. While the University 
has taken several steps to 
combat this rhetoric, it has 
still 
left 
students 
worried 

about their safety on campus, 
prompting many to protest.

Rodriguez said the current 

political situation and campus 
climate have left people fearful 
that the elections won’t result 
in their favor and, in turn, 
fearful of how those results 
will affect their lives.

“Some of the same groups 

we 
hear 
targeted 
in 
the 

political rhetoric are targeted 
on campus by fliers and all of 
this stuff echoes each other,” 
Rodriguez said. “Once this 
election is over we’ve made it 
OK to say a lot of callous things 
and we will have to deal with 
the aftermath of that for quite 
a while.”

Oweiss said the aftermath of 

the election will have a lasting 
impact on his community, 
saying 
he 
believes 
racist 

interactions are occurring in 
many communities.

“One of my friends was 

walking home late at night, 
and she was verbally harassed 
by three guys based on her 
race,” Oweiss said. “Stuff like 
that, where she’s a woman in 
a hijab walking alone at night, 
is worrying — that could be 
my mom or my sister or close 
friend.”

“So if something else happens, 
then we’d say, ‘Hey students, 
you signed on to this. You 
agreed to be an ally,’ ”

One of the units that has 

already expressed support for 
the campaign’s cause is the 
Office of Multi-Ethnic Student 
Affairs. Trey Boynton, the 
director of MESA, addressed 
the 
general 
assembly 
at 

CSG’s meeting last Tuesday, 
promoting 
the 
body’s 

message of a more welcoming 
environment.

MESA’s core work involves 

community 
engagement, 

leadership development and 

social justice education. Along 
with its staff of six, the office 
partners with other groups 
on campus to amplify student 
voices.

In 
MESA’s 
mission 

statement about racial justice 
work, 
Boynton 
said, 
“We 

want to transform the student 
experience 
by 
building 

inclusive spaces and equitable 
opportunities for all students.”

In addition to MESA, CSG 

has also reached out to the 
UM Black Student Union and 
the Dean of Students Advisory 
Board to partner with them on 
the campaign.

“It’s about supporting those 

groups on campus that do this 
work,” Griggs said. “So we 
don’t want to be the driving 
force always that implements 

these programs, but we want 
to support student orgs and 
departments that already do 
them just to continue that 
conversation.”

During the CSG meeting 

Tuesday, Boynton expressed 
MESA’s unwavering support 
for CSG’s initiative, which 
Griggs has said she hopes 
to receive from many other 
student 
organizations 
on 

campus.

“Well 
done,” 
Boynton 

said. “Way to live up to who 
you want to be. Way to be 
aspirational in practice. We 
(MESA) are happy to travel 
with you as you travel down 
this road standing and being in 
solidarity. I am so immensely 
grateful that I am not alone in 
this world.”

Vote Chuck Warpehoski

N 

ext week, Ann Arbor residents will vote to elect the city’s mayor 
as well as five candidates to fill seats on City Council. Five of 
the six seats are uncontested, including the mayoral position. 

But for the fifth City Council seat in Ward 5, voters will be choosing 
between incumbent Chuck Warpehoski (D) and David Silkworth (I), 
an insurance claim representative for homeowners and businesses. 
Though both candidates emphasize important initiatives, The Michigan 
Daily’s Editorial Board endorses Chuck Warpehoski for City Council. 
His experience; support for affordable housing, transportation safety 
and a new commuter rail; and his commitment to issues of diversity 
make him the more qualified candidate for the position.

Affordable housing is an 

important topic often debated 
in Ann Arbor. During Cental 
Student Government’s town 
hall on affordable housing, 
many residents and University 
of Michigan students voiced 
concerns about the lack of 
affordable 
housing. 
Though 

both candidates have spoken to 
this issue, Warpehoski’s support 
for the creation of affordable 
housing 
is 
all-encompassing, 

emphasizing the need for a 
significantly greater number of 
affordable housing units, not 
just subsidies — a position The 
Michigan Daily’s Editorial Board 
supported 
earlier 
this 
year. 

Expanding affordable housing is 
crucial to keeping the University 
affordable for everyone.

Warpehoski 
also 

understands 
the 
pressing 

issues of transportation and 
safety in Ann Arbor. Not only 
does he aim to make roadways 
safer for drivers and to add 
bike lanes — an effort that 
is helpful for all (especially 
students traveling to North 
Campus) — he also emphasizes 
the 
need 
for 
changes 
to 

transportation 
around 
Ann 

Arbor 
and, 
more 
broadly, 

the state, that will be more 
environmentally 
sustainable. 

In 
September, 
Warpehoski 

voted in favor of the regional 
transit tax proposal. This tax is 
crucial, as it will help connect 
Detroit and metro Detroit to 
surrounding states, allowing 
for more job, education and 
social opportunities, especially 
for Detroit residents.

In 
addition 
to 
big-ticket 

issues of regional importance, 
Warpehoski 
played 
an 

important role in a controversial 
proposal 
currently 
on 
the 

ballot to extend City Council 
member terms from two to 
four years. Warpehoski, while 
not explicitly for or against the 
proposal, backed the motion to 
put this issue to a popular vote. 
As the Daily Editorial Board 
noted in its endorsement of this 
proposal, this change would 
likely increase voter turnout and 
subsequently make City Council 
more representative. It may 
also generate more productivity 
and 
create 
more 
long-term 

projects, because members will 
have longer terms and won’t 
spend as much of their terms 
campaigning for reelection.

Warpehoski 
has 
also 

consistently been an advocate 
for diversity and inclusivity 
throughout his time on City 
Council, 
which 
is 
vastly 

important 
moving 
forward 

for students of Ann Arbor. In 
2014, Warpehoski sponsored 
legislation 
to 
prohibit 
city 

employers from forcing job 
applicants to disclose past 
convictions 
— 
a 
law 
that 

the Daily’s Editorial Board 
endorsed at the state level 
shortly after President Barack 
Obama banned the box on 
the federal level. He has also 
worked in conjunction with 
Black Lives Matter activists 
to create programs for local 
police departments to prevent 
bias. Already, he has helped 
select a police chief who will 
push forward with programs 
such as these.

While his support of the 

deer cull may leave some 
people 
questioning 
his 

dedication to the preservation 

of wildlife, Warpehoski cites 
environmental 
concerns 
as 

the main reason for his support. 
During a forum hosted by the 
League of Women Voters in July 
of this year, Warpehoski noted 
that the overpopulation of deer has 
allowed their predator populations 
to flourish, making it increasingly 
difficult for Ann Arbor to remain 
ecologically diverse — something 
necessary for the survival of native 
plants and wildlife. What’s more, 
his commitment to remedying 
potential 
environmental 

hazards 
resulting 
from 
the 

toxin 1,4-dioxane found in local 
groundwater further highlights 
his desire to protect the safety of 
the people of Ann Arbor as well as 
wildlife in the area.

With all of this said, we 

recognize there are ways in which 
Warpehoski 
could 
improve. 

Silkworth has emphasized the 
importance 
of 
transparency 

in how and why City Council 
makes certain decisions, an 
area in which Warpehoski 
leaves something more to be 
desired. It is important to 
consider that Warpehoski has 
been a City Council member 
for four years and his position 
aligns with that of many other 
members, whereas Silkworth 
would be bringing in a new 
perspective. 
We 
encourage 

Warpehoski to examine the 
ways in which City Council 
presents its information and 
communicates with the public.

Nonetheless, 
Chuck 

Warpehoski’s 
experience, 

support for affordable housing 
and 
transportation 
and 

commitment to diversity make 
him the candidate you should 
vote for next Tuesday.

A

s 
a 
first-semester 

freshman, one of the 
pieces of advice given to 

me so frequently by older students 
was that, in college, most of my 
learning would happen outside 
the classroom. They 
weren’t 
trying 
to 

diminish the value of 
the courses here — at 
least as far as I could 
tell — but rather, 
stress the importance 
of getting involved on 
campus.

Three years later, 

I can confidently say 
my college experience 
wouldn’t 
have 
been 

nearly as beneficial — in terms 
of both personal and intellectual 
growth — had it not included the 
many extracurriculars I had the 
privilege of being involved in. 
The leadership, writing, critical 
thinking and interpersonal skills 
I gained from my extracurricular 
experiences have been invaluable 
and have augmented my college 
experience in ways no traditional 
course could have.

Additionally, these experiences 

may 
have 
opened 
academic 

opportunities I might not have had 
otherwise. I couldn’t have majored 
in public policy had I not been 
admitted into the Ford School of 
Public Policy — a selective program 
which seeks “students with strong 
transcripts … who are also engaged 
in serious ways with campus 
organizations, community service, 
political 
organizations, 
and 

leadership activities,” according to 
the Ford School website.

However, 
campus 

involvement 
is 
expensive. 

Without my parents’ financial 
support, I wouldn’t have been 
able to spend the bulk of my 
free time on extracurricular 
activities. Instead, I would’ve 
needed to work part-time to help 
pay for my tuition and general 
living costs at college.

During the two semesters I 

worked as a senior editor at the 
Daily, I probably spent a rough 
average of 20 hours per week on 
Daily-related activities. Assuming 
I could’ve found a job that 
would’ve paid me $10 an hour, 20 
hours a week for both semesters, 
my senior editor position cost 
me around $6,000 in forgone 
income. While the Daily does 
provide a stipend that helps to 
partially offset this opportunity 
cost, the vast majority of campus 
organizations don’t.

In an interview with the 

Daily, 
LSA 
senior 
David 

Schafer, 
Central 
Student 

Government 
president, 
said 

that 
campus 
leadership 
is 

expensive primarily because it 

requires 
students 

to 
sacrifice 

opportunities 
for 

paid work.

“Some 

organizations 
require 
their 

members to pay dues, 
but all necessitate 
that leaders dedicate 
large 
amounts 
of 

time 
without 
the 

promise of pay or 

compensation,” Schafer said.

A 2015 Georgetown University 

Center on Education and the 
Workforce 
study 
found 
that 

70 to 80 percent of Americans 
enrolled in post-secondary classes 
work during the academic year. 
Additionally, roughly 40 percent 

of undergraduate and 76 percent of 
graduate students work at least 30 
hours per week while enrolled in 
classes. It’s difficult to fathom that 
students working 30 hours or more 
per week could devote considerable 
time to extracurricular activities.

That’s why the University 

of Michigan’s new Leadership 
Engagement 
Scholarship 
is 

so essential. The Leadership 
Engagement 
Scholarship 
will 

award $500 to $2,500 to 10 to 
15 emerging and established 
campus leaders with financial 
need each year. The program 
was designed to reduce the 
considerable opportunity costs of 
campus involvement, as well as 
establish a mentorship network 
of scholarship recipients.

According to lSA senior Micah 

Griggs, CSG Vice President Micah 
Griggs, the inspiration for the 
scholarship program came from 
the many students she believes 
were interested in participating 
in the CSG executive council, 
but couldn’t afford to spend the 
required amount of time on a non-
paid, non-academic activity.

“A lot of people were applying 

to CSG executive team and were 
requesting if it was paid or not and 
it isn’t at all,” Griggs told the Daily. 
“That really drew a barrier for a 
lot of applicants for our executive 
team because they couldn’t afford 
to give up a paying job.”

The idea that there is a cost 

barrier to CSG participation is 
supported by data from an internal 
CSG survey, which found that 75 
percent of CSG members come 
from households earning at least 
$100,000 annually. Opening those 
opportunities to a more diverse 
group of students would certainly 
beget stronger representation — 
and ideally an influx of new ideas 
— from individuals facing cost 
barriers to campus leadership.

Only roughly one out of every 

eight University students comes 
from a low-income family. Twenty-
one of the top 25 public universities 
in the United States have a higher 
proportion 
of 
students 
from 

families earning less than $50,000 
annually than the University of 
Michigan. Perhaps, if highlighted 
in prospective student recruiting 
efforts, 
the 
new 
Leadership 

Engagement Scholarship could 
help strengthen income diversity 
at the University.

However, 
offering 

competitive 
scholarships 
to 

a limited number of students 
seems unlikely to remove the 
barrier to campus engagement 
that many students face. The 
number of students working 
in paid positions is correlated 
with the rising cost of college 
tuition. More widespread and 
sustainable solutions to this 
problem would address root 
causes of the increasing price 
of higher education. Assuming 
these costs are here to stay 
— at least in the near term — 
programs like the Leadership 
Engagement Scholarship are 
likely the best alternative.

T

his is an exciting time 
for the University of 
Michigan. On Oct. 6, 

following a year-long planning 
process, 
we 
launched 
our 

five-year strategic plan for 
diversity, equity and inclusion. 
With the announcement of 
the plan, we signified our 
renewed pledge for creating 
an inclusive and equitable 
campus 
and 
developing 
a 

diverse university community.

Throughout this process, the 

University has been actively 
engaged with faculty, staff and 
students where open dialogue 
has allowed us to plan for the 
future while learning from our 
past. This has been vital to the 
process, especially now as we 
implement this plan.

Our commitment includes 

$85 million in new funding to 
support these efforts over the 
next five years in addition to 
the $40 million currently spent 
annually on DEI initiatives.

We have and continue to hear 

from many voices, both groups 
and individuals. The result 
of these conversations has 
paved the way for numerous 
new or reinvented programs 
and initiatives, examples of 
which 
include 
Wolverine 

Pathways, 
HAIL 
Scholars, 

LGBTQ Allyhood Development 
Trainings and a Ford School of 
Public Policy workshop series 
that 
will 
address 
political 

sensitivity and tolerance for 
other political views, among 
other facets of diversity. These 
DEI efforts, and so many others, 

are 
enriched 
through 
the 

determination of remarkable 
faculty, staff and students across 
this great institution.

Despite 
these 
efforts 
to 

create a more diverse, equitable 
and 
inclusive 
climate, 
our 

university 
community 
also 

has also faced messages of 
racial, ethnic and religious 
discrimination.

While we recognize the 

damage 
and 
hurt 
these 

messages 
can 
cause 
our 

community, 
we 
will 
not 

amplify the negative effects by 
specifically responding to each 
and every affront. For those 
in need, we will continue to 
provide front-line assistance, 
utilizing services such as 
the 
Bias 
Response 
Team, 

Counseling and Psychological 
Services and other support 
systems.

As stated previously by 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel, 
the 
ideology 

advocated in these messages 
does not reflect our core 
values 
at 
the 
University. 

In 
many 
instances, 
these 

individuals aim to disrupt 
our educational mission by 
gaining greater attention and 
publicity for their extreme 
ideologies. 
By 
diminishing 

the attention these individuals 
seek, 
we 
reinforce 
our 

unwavering 
commitment 
to 

diversity, equity and inclusion 
at the University.

As a way to combat these 

negative messages, we encourage 
demonstrations of support — 
including proactive community-
building 
experiences, 
which 

contest 
and 
transform 
these 

attacks against the values of our 

university community.

In 
support 
of 
this 

transformation, 
student, 

faculty 
and 
staff 
groups 

have been actively engaged 
in movements of solidarity 
to confront and debunk the 
ideologies espoused in these 
messages, like the “Spread 
Ideas, Not Hate” effort across

activities.


In this new miniseries, Daily 

Music Writers reminisce on the 
best live show they’ve seen.

If there’s one thing you do in 

life, never let someone belittle 
the things that make you happy. 
Everyone has different bands, 
books, movies, memories, activi-
ties, art, etc. that get them through 
the day. I don’t even care if tailgat-
ing out of a pickup truck at a coun-
try concert (a dreaded thought 
for someone like myself) is your 
cup of tea, because that’s your 
one-way ticket to a smile. I won’t 
pretend to understand, but by all 
means GO and make that beauti-
ful memory.

For me, it’s The Wonder Years, 

a pop-punk band from Philadel-
phia that barely fits in with my 
own music taste, causing the most 
paradoxical facet of my personal-
ity. Whether I like it or not, I owe a 
lot of who I am to this band.

On one fine afternoon, I opened 

Twitter to find what felt like the 
most personal of attacks within 
two connected tweets on my 
phone screen: “the year is 2016 
and people are still getting hank 
the pigeon tattooed on them.” 
“yeah it might’ve crossed my mind 
when I was 15 and (The Upsides) 
ruled my life but hey there’s a rea-
son u gotta be 18 rite?” For those 
of you unaware, The Upsides is 
the second album by The Wonder 
Years, and Hank is their mascot, 
two incredibly important symbols 
to me. So how could someone so 
blatantly belittle one of my per-
sonal lifelines?

At first, I became introspec-

tive. Would I outgrow The Won-
der Years? Am I just immature? Is 
The Upsides actually a bad album!? 
These questions haunted me for 
all of ten minutes until I snapped 
out of my ridiculous doubt. This 
band’s music taught me that home 

is where you invest your happi-
ness, and that isn’t something 
anyone can take away from you; 
ironically enough, The Upsides 
contradicts 
everything 
about 

the ideology presented in those 
tweets.

The Upsides is quite literally 

about the human desperation for 
positivity in the world, and it’s 
presented through multiple per-
spectives: a college student finish-
ing their last semester, a touring 
band and even someone who usu-
ally has a shitty time in social situ-
ations. “I’m looking for the upsides 
to these panic attack nights,” yells 
lead vocalist Dan Campbell to 
ignite “Washington Square Park.” 
It’s a line that has caused a crowd 
to explode around me on multiple 
occasions, and I’ll never tire of the 
surge of energy that flows through 
me because of it.

This universal electricity con-

nects not only the fans to the 
album but also the fans to each 
other. It has something for every-
one, which is why it’s revered as 
one of the most successful works 
in modern pop-punk. Almost 
four years have passed since I 
first heard The Upsides, and I still 
put it on when I need a reason to 
smile about existence. I’ve made 
exhausting trips to see these songs 
live, and I’ve made friends states 
away all because of this music.

I recently took a weekend trip 

to New York City to see The Won-
der Years perform two nights in 
a row at Webster Hall, and I was 
called every iteration of “crazy” 
by essentially everyone I know 
except for some of my best friends 
who met me there. I couldn’t stop 
listening to “Everything I Own 
Fits In This Backpack” before the 
trip because I quite literally could 
only bring my backpack with me 
on the plane. The way this album 
permeates my everyday life in the 
tiniest of ways has only solidified 
my happiness in irrationality. In 
Campbell’s own words, “I don’t 

make sense to anyone but my best 
friends,” and I couldn’t be more 
content because of the people who 
validate my insanity.

Long, retrospective introduc-

tions aside, The Wonder Years 
have consistently put on my 
favorite concerts of all time. The 
crowd crackles with excitement 
before they take the stage. When 
Campbell appears, a smile lights 
up every face around me at Web-
ster Hall. During the slow burn of 
the opening verse on “Cigarettes 
and Saints,” my friends and I (and 
most of the time even strangers) 
all clutch each other to sing in 
unison before they launch me on 
top of the crowd to sing, “We’re 
no saviors / if we can’t save our 
brothers.”

These concerts have transcend-

ed simple experience for me and 
have become my pursuit of hap-
piness. It’s these little moments 
of magic that cause my memories 
to sparkle in my mind’s eye, and I 
frankly will never become accus-
tomed to such a perfect mix of 
emotion. 

Yes, 
my 
personal 
upsides 

on this planet are literally The 
Upsides, all of The Wonder 
Years’ subsequent albums and, of 
course, making ill-advised trips 
to see them. Find your bliss, and 
hold onto it as tightly as you can. 
Get people to call you “crazy” 
over your passion, and laugh 
about it. Find people who will 
laugh with you, because it’s so 
worth sharing smiles and tears 
screaming your favorite songs at 
your favorite band.

It’s a beautiful thing to be able 

to grow with something, letting it 
encompass you in different ways 
along your journey. So the next 
time someone tells you to outgrow 
your happiness, you’ll know what 
to say. “I’m not sad anymore,” 
because I’ve been singing this line 
with The Wonder Years since I 
was 16 years old, and it’s one I’ll 
keep singing until the day I die.

TV REVIEW

DOMINIC POLSINELLI

Daily Arts Writer

Why I’ll never be too old to love The 
Wonder Years and ‘The Upsides’

The Philly pop-punks have put on my favorite concerts of all time

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

I can recall the very first time 

I was really amazed by archi-
tecture: my Ukrainian Ortho-
dox church at home. It was 
Orthodox Christmas, I was six 
and I could not understand one 
word of Ukrainian. So I decided 
to stare at the shining, psyche-
delic colors on the ceiling that 
outlined Jesus’ face and the 
twenty-foot stain glass win-
dows that hovered around the 
church’s walls. I don’t know if I 
was more overwhelmed by the 
foreignness of the religion and 
the language, or if it was the 
colossal structure I was stand-
ing in.

That same feeling hits me 

when I walk past Philadelphia’s 
City Hall 
 
— something I have 

done countless times. Every 
time I pause, look up and stare 
for about five minutes, and if I’m 
not in a hurry, I’ll end up sitting 
on a bench and gazing at it for 
least another five minutes. I will 
stroll into the atrium where the 
lion’s head shoots daggers at me 
while I observe the high-relief 
sculptures of founding fathers 
and scholars.

The 
symmetry, 
specificity 

and beauty of architecture has 

and always will astonish me. I 
believe these two places were 
where my passion for architec-
ture was born, even though I am 
nowhere close to being an archi-
tect. However, architecture, a 
topic that can fall under urban 
planning, civil engineering or 
even geometry, is a topic that I 
consider pure art.

In pursuit of this apprecia-

tion for architecture, I decided 
to take History of Art 101: Great 
Monuments. The class focused 
on international landmarks, the 
advancement of architecture 
from Stonehenge to both of the 
Notre Dames and the effects of 
historic architecture that still 
resides in modern day build-
ings. In this class, I fell in love 
with the Santiago de Compos-
tela (1075 CE) and Hagia Sophia 
(532 CE), where I was fascinat-
ed that people of that time could 
design such stalwart structures 
with unimaginable allure.

And even after being exposed 

to these enormous creations, 
I can still have that same feel-
ing of fascination when I enter 
smaller, local places like the 
Michigan Theater or Rack-
ham Auditorium. Their ceiling 
designs and spacious layout is 
beyond admirable to me, and 
it allows me to think of how I 
want to present my own art.

As peculiar as it may sound, 

I find a distinct connection 
between architecture and writ-
ing. The individuality, miniscule 
detail, use of space (in terms of 
setting, characters and narra-
tor vs. reader) and the overall 
idea of leaving an impression 
on someone can be applied to 
both the craft of architecture 
and the written word. I get the 
same feeling when I see the Lin-
coln Memorial as I do when I 
read Vonnegut — this empower-
ing emotion that ignites artistic 
inspiration for myself.

After learning about such 

famous churches in Europe like 
the Sagrada Família or Saint-
Chapelle, I always think back to 
my Ukrainian church. Altogeth-
er, all of these original, astound-
ing pieces of art inspire me to 
write about my own unique 
life as someone who was raised 
with three religions.

And as for City Hall, I will 

soon be back in Philadelphia 
with my journal in hand, and I 
will write the thoughts that stir 
in my mind while I stare at this 
key symbol of our nation’s his-
tory and Philadelphia’s birth. 
Most of the time, it leaves me 
speechless, but with architec-
ture as my muse, I will be sure 
to create some form of writing 
out of my ineffable experience.

Magic of Ukrainian architecture

BEST CONCERT EVER

Friday, November 4, 2016 — 5A

Just a few years ago, Thelo-

nious Martin was an ambitious 
beat-maker studying music at 
Columbia College in Chicago — 
the same school that Kanye West 
famously dropped out of — and 
professionally networking with 
other youthfully eager artists, 
specifically Vic Mensa and his 
SAVEMONEY crew. After being 
introduced to Stones Throw 
Records 
through 
their 
work 

with raunchy, late-night TV net-
work Adult Swim, he committed 
himself to studying the styles of 
label figureheads like J Dilla and 
Madlib, 
eventually 
becoming 

sharp enough to emulate them.

Thelonious Martin’s new EP, 

Late Night Programming, is an 
ode to his inspirers and an old-
school beat tape packed with hard 
drums, thick strings, recycled 
Dilla sound-bites (think the Jada-
kiss laugh: “Ah-ha!”) and dialogue 
that’s been carefully chosen from 
his favorite TV shows. The Michi-
gan Daily caught up with him to 
talk about making the 25-minute 
masterpiece.

‘Late Night Programming’ 

is a special project. Of course, 
its beats are sharp, soulful and 
enticing, but its interludes and 
theme add a cinematic qual-
ity. Was your creative process 
for the EP any different from 
usual? Were you making music 
with a story or specific TV 
shows in mind?

This process was definitely dif-

ferent from a vast majority of my 
newer projects, but more so of an 
expansion of my previous beat 
tapes from when I started. This 
project is very cohesive, and so 
when I was looking for interludes, 
I stayed true to my own character, 
my likes, dislikes, etc. So pick-
ing shows was a breeze, I didn’t 
get outside of myself, which is so 
important. Be yourself and good 
things will happen.

I know that your first expe-

rience with J Dilla’s music — 
which is one of your largest 
influences — came while watch-
ing Adult Swim. Have you had 
the idea to create something 
like this EP — which is a sort 
of ode to late-night TV binge 

sessions — for a while, perhaps 
even since back then, at four-
teen, or did it occur to you more 
recently?

I think this is all starting to 

come together in a way where I’m 
comfortable to tell my story. I’ve 
made attempts to or had projects 
with hints of this but none like 
this. This is me fully comfort-
able and creating just for myself. 
I think the 14-year-old me would 
be extremely happy with the 
results.

Over 
the 
summer 
you 

released “Bomaye,” an awe-
some single for Adult Swim 
with Joey Purp. How did it 
feel to get that sort of musical 
recognition from the network 
itself, especially after they had 
played such a taste-making role 
in your development?

It’s been amazing working 

with Adult Swim. Jason Clark, 
who is responsible for the ini-
tial Adult Swim x Stones Throw 
campaign to begin with has been 
a great friend. Everything is com-
ing full circle and to be apart of an 
incredible alumni is truly hum-
bling. I hope there’s a kid getting 
into music the same way I did 
right now, that’d be awesome.

You’ve 
chosen 
a 
special 

moment to release ‘Late Night 
Programming.’ More and more 
people are habitually stream-
ing TV online instead of watch-
ing it live. Are you worried that 
“bumps” as we knew them may 
lose some of their esteem? 

It’s odd you ask that. I don’t 

even have cable, I use Hulu, Net-
flix, and stream sports. Yet noth-
ing beats being at my grandma’s 
house and just watching Cartoon 
Network. I think as much as 
we’ve invested into the genera-
tion of television, even the Adult 
Swim network online shows 
bumps and what not. What’s qual-
ity will always remain. 

What shows are you watch-

ing 
right 
now? 
I’ve 
been 

obsessed with “Atlanta” and 
“Westworld.” Their teams are 
doing really impressive work.

I’ve been watching “Atlan-

ta,” rewatching “”Community,” 
“Cowboy Bebop,” “Trigun” and 
I just started watching “”Inse-
cure.” 

Oh and I can’t wait for the new 

season of “Rick and Morty”...I’m 

itching for it.

Would you ever consider 

writing or working on an 
original television series? You 
would be an especially fit music 
supervisor.

I would love to do music super-

vision!

Honestly, it’s a dream of mine, 

as much as I’d like to score, music 
supervision is much of the same, 
creating those moments. Shouts 
to Scott Verner I’d like pick 
his brain, he created so many 
moments on Entourage with his 
music selection.

I know that you prefer 

working with artists in per-
son instead of exchanging files 
through email. In the documen-
tary on your ‘Wunderkid’ stu-
dio sessions, it seems like that 
tactic allows you to achieve a 
unique musical synergy. Could 
you see yourself making a full-
length collaboration with one 
or two other artists? If so, who 
might they be? ‘Polo Sporting 
Goods’ with RetcH was a great 
project.

Working on a quite a few 

producer/artist projects at the 
moment. Theophilus Martins and 
I have a project, I just dropped 
an album with my man K.eye.D, 
I’m working on a EP with my 
guy Swade and Topaz Jones just 
dropped his own album but we’re 
back at work on some new mate-
rial.

I’m truly a fan of showcasing 

the chemistry between an artist 
and a producer, there’s nothing 
like it, showing the range and 
depth achievable by two artist on 
the same page. It’s beautiful.

You have expressed interest 

in creating music that’s well 
beyond the scope of hip hop 
and proven yourself more than 
capable on songs like “Cor-
ners of Your Mind.” Is there a 
broadly musical follow-up to 
‘Wunderkid’ in the works?

As Seen On TV will definitely 

dive deeper into more genres 
beside rap. I’m happy to show my 
chops outside of what’s expected 
of me, I don’t just listen to rap so 
my music is going to reflect that. 
I can’t wait to break out the mean 
flute solos on the next album. I’m 
kidding about the flute solo, but 
look for it to be musically in depth 
like my taste in music.

MUSIC INTERVIEW

BEST CONCERT EVER

In this new miniseries, Daily 

Music Writers reminisce on the best 
live show they’ve seen.

There isn’t much in this world 

that holds the same significance 
as seeing your favorite band for 
the first time. For me, it was some-
thing that seemed impossible, 
but unfortunately, that’s what I 
unwillingly signed up for when I 
started to like Fall Out Boy during 
the band’s hiatus. It was tough to 
be into a band that I was unable to 
see live, especially as there were 
so many people I knew who had 
already had that privilege.

When their return from hia-

tus was announced in 2013, and 
a comeback show was slated to 
occur in London, I knew that I had 
to be there. Through some weird 
quirk of fate, I actually managed 
to get tickets to the 500-capacity 
venue, and so, in late February, I 
caught a six-hour overnight coach 
to the capital by myself to see Fall 
Out Boy. It was surreal. I was only 
17 at the time, and being in London 
itself was an exciting situation, let 

alone the thought of the concert in 
the evening.

Arriving at the venue, there 

was no doubt that there was an 
important event about to take 
place. Despite turning up a sig-
nificant amount of time before the 
doors opened, the queue to get in 
the door was already several 100 
meters long, and those at the front 
looked like they’d been camped 
out for a while. The Underworld, 
the venue chosen for the Lon-
don one-off show, is a tiny room 
underneath a pub right by Cam-
den Town station, and it filled up 
quickly.

There was no supporting act 

and no confirmed stage time for 
the band. Anticipation hung heavy 
in the air. Everyone in the room 
knew how lucky they were to be 
there, and everyone in the room 
was also a ridiculously obsessed 
Fall Out Boy fan, and I don’t think 
I’ve felt an atmosphere like it.

When Fall Out Boy finally took 

to the stage, to “Thriller” no less, 
the room exploded. The next hour 
and a half of music flew by in an 
emotional frenzy; I lost my friend 
mid-way through despite the size 
of the venue, and when I found 

them at the end, it was an emo-
tional moment — we’d actually 
met online through being fans of 
the band.

The concert was everything 

you could have asked for. The 
size of the venue meant that you 
couldn’t be more than several 
meters away from any member 
of the band, so intimacy wasn’t 
even a question. The setlist was 
a Fall Out Boy fan’s dream, songs 
from every era, including oddi-
ties like “Lake Effect Kid” from 
the Citizens FOB Mixtape. When 
they finished with new song “My 
Songs Know What You Did In 
The Dark (Light ‘Em Up),” which 
everyone already knew the words 
to despite it only being out for a 
week, the ambiance was incred-
ible. They left the stage to some 
of the loudest applause the venue 
had ever heard.

Filtering out through the venue 

and resurfacing to Camden, now 
wrapped up in a hoody with “RIP 
HIATUS” emblazoned on it — a 
statement that the amount of life 
in the performance clearly exem-
plified — I was still awestruck 
with just how good the concert 
had been.

. Joyce Manor

The California punk 

group is one of the closest 

throwbacks to The Ramones 
I’ve ever heard, with a killer 
combina-
tion of 
catchy mel-
odies, loud 
guitars and 
brief songs. 
As The 
Ramones 
sped up 
girl-group 
and surf-
pop sounds 
and ran 
them through a darker, New-
York-nightclub filter to create 
bizarre guitar music, Joyce 
Manor slices up the last few 
decades of SoCal pop-punk, 
turning the snotty stylings 
of Billy Joe Armstrong and 
Tom DeLonge into breakneck 
surf-and-skate songs that can 
barely be contained.

The band’s most recent 

album, Cody, is its most 
focused and evolved work yet. 
The band’s longest release to 
date at 25 minutes, it features 
full-fledged character sketch-
es, more developed (and pop-
pier) songwriting and Barry 
Johnson making references to 
Kanye that may be ironic or 
may be completely sincere.

While they seem inter-

ested in artistic change, Joyce 
Manor realizes that what you 
leave out of your work is just 
as important as what you put 
in. The band knows exactly 
what makes a good song, and 
they won’t add any BS to an 
already-perfect formula.

2. Car Seat Headrest
Will Toledo’s prolific DIY 

project is pop-punk for grad-
school students, delivering 
wry, introverted observation to 
those who are wild rulebreak-
ers on the inside, even if they 
wear thick glasses and like 
Wes Anderson movies.

Toledo, only 24 years old, 

has been self-releasing albums 
under the name Car Seat 
Headrest for over five years 
now, delivering almost a dozen 
records to a small-but-devoted 
online following before being 
signed by indie giant Matador 
Records and becoming a name 
to know in the alternative 
mainstream. His low, mostly 
monotone voice and sometimes 
inscrutable, sometimes snarky 
lyrics call to mind ’90s slacker 
god Stephen Malkmus, while 
Car Seat’s simple instrumenta-
tion bely an intellectual bent 
familiar to any anxious person 
who can’t help but constantly 
read multiple layers in every 
sight and situation.

“Drunk Drivers/Killer 

Whales,” off this year’s Teens 
of Denial, takes a few chords 
and an old-school loud-quiet-
loud dynamic and sets the 
stage for an intense yet thrill-
ing meditation on parties, 
discomfort and the desire to 
make destructive decisions. 
“Here’s that voice in your 
head / Giving you shit again 
/ But you know he loves you / 

And he doesn’t mean to cause 
you pain,” sings Toledo, who 
somehow manages to turn 
this subject into the most epic 
indie-rock anthem of the year.

3. Hop Along
Frances Quinlan’s voice 

is entrancing. The singer of 
freaky Philadelphian folkers-
turned-rockers Hop Along 
is the star of every track, in 
full command even when she 
pushes her voice over the 
brink. Sometimes, she sounds 
like a nervous breakdown over 
a string section. Other times, 
she’s telling stories with 
weirdly specific details over 
post-punk guitars. Every time, 
you want to strain your ears 
to make sure you’re hearing 
every syllable.

Even with though they’re 

just now getting notices from 
mainstream press, Hop Along 
have already recorded some 
perfect, instant-classic songs. 
The brilliantly crafted build-
up and witty lyrics of “Tibetan 
Pop Stars” make it a flagship 
song and easy intro point for 
the Philly rock scene, while 
“No Good Al Joad” is a chill-
ing, disjointed meditation on 
death in which Quinlan’s has 
never sounded better or more 
unhinged. Contemporary 
alternative rock hasn’t pro-
duced many icons of late, but 
Quinlan has the singular voice 
to haunt teenage bedrooms for 
decades to come.

4. Modern Baseball
MoBo started as a guilty 

pleasure band, one that 
whined about women who 
didn’t like them in the most 
annoying yet undeniably 
infectious ways. Their cho-
ruses forced you to sing along 
even if you disagreed with the 
underlying message behind 
lines like, “That girl who’s 
next to me, she’s friendly and 
thoughtful and quite awfully 
pretty / But all she has to say 
is a meathead-themed mono-
logue on why Brad ran away.”

But Modern Baseball has 

grown up. First, it was with 
2014’s You’re Gonna Miss 
It All, which still explored 
romance and relationships, 
but did so with a more bal-
anced point of view and even 
more anthemic choruses. Now, 
MoBo has gone even further 
with this year’s Holy Ghost, 
the band’s most complex and 
thought-out work yet.

The most recent chapter 

of Modern Baseball, a band 
whose every lyric feels like it 
was lifted from a private diary, 
is intertwined with co-singer/
co-songwriter Brendan Luke-
ns’s battle with mental illness, 
which he has talked about at 
length during the promotional 
tour for Holy Ghost.

These interviews and Luke-

ns’s honesty serve as a way to 
destigmatization of mental 
illness, and they showcase 
rock music not just as a venue 
for escapism and shared emo-
tion, as it often is, but also as 
a tool for social activism and 
a means for improving the 
world.

5. Against Me!
Against Me! is by far the 

oldest band on this list, with 
recordings dating all the 
way back to the late ’90s, 
but you could say the band 
had never existed in its best, 
most authentic form until its 
2013 creative breakthrough 
Transgender Dysphoria Blues. 
Between the group’s previous 
album and TDB, singer Laura 
Jane Grace, then known pub-
licly as Tom Gabel, came out as 
transgender in a Rolling Stone 
interview.

Since her coming out, Grace 

has become a prominent 
LGBTQ activist and written 
a memoir, and she remains 
the most widely known and 
beloved figure in the still-very-
underground LGBTQ punk 
scene. Meanwhile, the band 
she leads is enjoying some of 
its greatest success yet, most 
recently with last month’s 
Shape Shift With Me.

While Against Me! isn’t the 

most musically adventurous 
band, Grace’s personal voice 
adds a new dimension to the 
old punk canon. Her shouted 
vocals are a window into pain 
and perseverance, a lengthy, 
terrifying journey into her 
own soul. Her words penetrate 
deeper than any chord can, 
and they’ve broken down bar-
riers and opened doors that, 
until very recently and even 
now in many cases, remain 
locked shut for a lifetime.

Honorable Mention: 

Japandroids

Japandroids were rock’s 

Frank Ocean, an artist with a 
cult following who tantalized 
fans by withholding for years a 
follow-up to a beloved album. 
But this week, they finally 
announced a new record: Near 
to the Wild Heart of Life, which 
comes nearly five years after 
Celebration Rock.

Celebration Rock is the most 

up-front, honest album title 
in music history, and Japan-
droids’ new single — the title 
track to Wild Heart — delivers 
more of the exact same. It’s 
pounding, loud and simple, a 
song that mixes Springsteen’s 
highway anthems and Oasis’s 
fist-pumping, beer-drinking 
fun with the lo-fi aesthetics 
of a scrappy, close-knit indie 
community.

These six bands (and the 

countless more who tour and 
release records alongside 
them) aren’t just separate, 
cool entities — they’re part of 
a movement that could change 
the way we think about rock 
music. What often gets clas-
sified as old, white, conserva-
tive male music could become 
a new frontier for energetic 
change, beauty and experi-
mentation. Right now is one 
of the best times in history 
for rock fans, and with Japan-
droids already lined up for a 
release in January, the future 
is just as bright.

The 5 rock bands you 

need to hear now

These artists are part of a movement that can change rock ‘n’ roll

In 1969, five plucked notes on 

John Paul Jones’s bass would intro-
duce Led Zeppelin to the world as 
the new hot thing, a group capable 
of assuming The Beatles’ vacated 
role as the greatest band on the 
planet. “Dazed and Confused” 
encapsulates an entire musical 
movement and gave birth to a wave 
of bands trying to copy them. The 
thumping opening bass line is one 
of the catchiest and most iconic in 
rock ‘n’ roll history, a perfect way 
to introduce the next six minutes 
and 29 seconds of hard-rock nec-
tar. Plant’s shrieking, soulful vocals 
complement the yearning lyrics, 
while the shredding solo and pierc-
ing guitar twang replay in my ear 
for hours. It is truly a benchmark 
for the hard rock genre.

In 
1993, 
Richard 
Linklater 

(“Boyhood”) used the same name 
for his ’70s-based high school hang-
out movie that included only the 
best of adolescent debauchery and 
hormone-fueled self discovery. On 
paper, the movie sounds lackluster 
and uninspired: several groups of 
rising seniors celebrate the start 
of summer by hazing freshmen, 
partying and crusin’ around in the 
suburbs of Austin, Texas. Linklat-
er’s movie, however, still proves to 
be the greatest high school movie 
since “American Graffiti.” “Dazed 
and Confused” is a true benchmark 
of all coming-of-age stories.

Using my childhood friend 

Dylan’s dad as a reference for 
what high school was like in 
1976, “Dazed and Confused” 
is apparently as accurate as a 
period piece can be. Obviously, 
not everyone was hot-boxing in 
the school parking lot or flirting 
with teachers, but the overall 

attitude is replicated well.

The main character, Randall 

“Pink” Floyd (Jason London, 
“The Man in the Moon”), is some-
one everyone knew at this time, 
a seemingly prototypical high 
schooler 
with 
nonconformist 

undertones and doubts about his 
purpose. As he struggles to decide 
whether or not to give in and sign 
a contract for the football team 
claiming his devout abstinence 
from alcohol and drugs, he ques-
tions the meaning of sacrificing 
individuality for an undeserving 
cause. It is not so much about the 
drinking and smoking as it is the 
forced submission.

Like any Linklater movie, the 

conversations 
and 
messages, 

although always engaging, some-
times seem to be vacuous and 
pseudo-philosophical, but actu-
ally reflect many insightful ideas, 
especially for a group of stoned 
and drunk 17-year-olds. “Pink” 
defines what it means to be an 
independent teen searching for 
an epiphany of what life is really 
about without ever coming across 
as pretentious or preachy.

Like any quality coming-of-age 

movie, “Dazed and Confused” 
launched the careers of some of 
the biggest stars today, such as 
Matthew McConaughey (“Dallas 
Buyers Club”), Ben Affleck (“Gone 
Girl”), Parker Posey (“Best in 
Show”) and Adam Goldberg (“Sav-
ing Private Ryan”). The ensemble 
cast is divided up into different 
groups just like any typical high 
school: the football players, the 
burnouts, the geeks and the ris-
ing freshmen. “Pink” meanders 
between these groups as a media-
tor for their vast differences.

Particularly, 
it 
is 
Rory 

Cochrane’s (“A Scanner Darkly”) 

character Slater that steals most of 
the laughs, which says a lot. While 
standing on top of a water tower 
at night, Slater looks out into the 
vast, single-family home scattered 
suburbia and ponders something 
always on the mind of a promis-
cuous teen: how many people out 
there are currently having sex. All 
jokes and immaturity aside, this 
brief scene is so brilliant because 
it actually sounds like something I 
heard (or said) at some point dur-
ing high school. This will always 
be engrained in my head as the 
movie’s finest moment.

“Dazed 
and 
Confused”’s 

soundtrack features an arsenal of 
some of the biggest hits of the time, 
like Aerosmith’s “Sweet Emotion” 
and War’s “Low Rider.” But, it is 
Bob Dylan’s “Hurricane” that car-
ries the film the most. The song 
plays in the local hangout spot for 
the high schoolers and acts as the 
perfect soundtrack to this moment. 
The scene seamlessly flows like it 
was orchestrated to the song, each 
development in the song oddly lin-
ing up with the characters’ move-
ments and gazes.

Linklater’s decision to name 

the movie after the Led Zeppe-
lin shred-fest likely was not done 
in arrogance. However, it only 
makes sense to me that it was; the 
song is the best hard rock song of 
all time and the movie is the best 
high school movie. You can play 
the movie during a casual group 
hangout or watch intently on your 
computer alone with headphones, 
staring into the characters’ souls. 
As “Dazed and Confused” is one 
of those songs that is always enter-
taining, the movie is pure cine-
matic bliss, an experience that will 
always lighten my day from even 
the most somber of depths.

Understated Winborg could be just what ‘M’ needs

Adam Winborg isn’t a “rah-

rah” type of player.

Michigan senior defenseman 

and captain Nolan De Jong says 
that Winborg has been pretty 
quiet during his first year in Ann 
Arbor. Perhaps the freshman 
forward’s low profile is a result 
of his circumstances — he 
wasn’t the highly touted recruit 
that teammates Will Lockwood 
and Luke Martin were, and he 
was also suspended for the first 
five games of the season (he 
played five games past his 21st 
birthday for the Janesville Jets 
of the NAHL).

But now, Winborg is on the 

ice, and his impact is already 
being felt. De Jong said that the 
team has “done way too much 
talking this year and not enough 
of showing it on the ice and in 
our play,” and that’s a need that 
Winborg can help solve.

“He was pretty quiet,” De 

Jong said. “(He) just comes in 
and does his work. He’s not 
going to air out, not the type of 
kid to complain, whether it’s in 
the weight room or around the 
boys. We’ve had guys scratched 
that long, so he 
knew 
he 
was 

going 
to 
have 

the opportunity, 
and he’s taken 
advantage of it 
so far.”

Against 

Vermont 
last 

weekend, 
he 

led 
the 
team 

with 
three 

blocked 
shots, 

and against Dartmouth the 
following night, he recorded 
the first goal of his career on 

a power play to stake his team 
with an early 1-0 lead.

It was the type of goal 

Michigan has had too few of 
this season — Winborg planted 
himself in front of the net, got 
a stick on the puck and scored 
what he calls a “garbage goal.”

“It was nice to get that first 

goal out of the way pretty early,” 
Winborg said Thursday. “It 
wasn’t the prettiest goal, but it 
went in, and hopefully we can 
start winning some games this 
weekend. But it was definitely 
nice to get that first goal.”

“Obviously, when he wasn’t 

playing, he was putting a lot of 
extra work in with Joe — our 
conditioning coach — in the 
weight room and doing a lot of 
extra skating and things like 
that,” De Jong said. “But I think 
he’s been really attentive in all 
the meetings that we’ve had 
even when he wasn’t playing and 
he was very focused on what he 
had to do to be successful.”

Winborg doesn’t have the 

age or experience of a typical 
Michigan recruit. On a roster 
littered with 18- and 19-year-
old freshmen, Winborg — born 
in 1995 — stands out. Originally 
from Sweden, he spent three 

years 
in 

Janesville, Wis., 
playing for the 
Jets, where he 
led the team in 
scoring his last 
two years. But 
despite his level 
of 
production, 

Winborg 
didn’t 

make a college 
commitment 
until late April 

of this year, when he chose to 
attend Michigan.

His experience has helped 

him in numerous ways already 
this year. He has used his 
size to his advantage on the 
ice, like with his goal against 
Dartmouth. And perhaps more 
importantly, for a team that is 
clearly still searching for an 
identity through the early part 
of the season, Winborg already 
knows what he is.

“I see myself as a two-way 

player,” Winborg said. “(I) play 
hard, and both my offense and 
defense are strong. (I) try to 

be hard in front of both nets, 
especially on offense. Score 
some garbage goals. Just be 
hard to play against down low 
and try to make some plays.

“I feel as though I have an 

advantage, too — to know what 
kind of player you are and what 
you are able to do, so that you 
can help the team succeed on 
the ice.”

Winborg admits there was 

some adjusting to do when he 
finally hit the ice. After all, it 

had been almost half a year 
since he had last played in a 
game, and college hockey plays 
at a different pace than the 
junior leagues.

But his captain and coach 

were pleased with his effort and 
performance, and if Winborg 
is indeed the type of worker 
De Jong and Berenson have 
given him credit for, there is no 
reason the late bloomer will stop 
blooming anytime soon.

“We’ve been waiting for him to 

have a chance to play, and we’ve 
had the chance to watch him in 
practice a lot,” Berenson said. “I 
think the things I’ve gotten from 
him are he’s a responsible player, 
(and) I think he’ll help us both 
offensively and defensively. We 
put him in front of the net on the 
power play — I think he can help 
us there. And I think he’ll help 
us on the penalty killing and also 
gives us some depth on center 
ice. I think he’s going to be a real 
solid player for us.”

Now back from suspension dating to NAHL, freshman forward could make a difference for slow-starting Wolverines

Michigan hockey coach Red Berenson thinks the Wolverines will benefit from Adam Winborg’s return to the lineup after missing the season’s first five games.

Wolverines looking to get back on track at ASU

It was expected that the 

Michigan hockey team would 
fall on some hard times this 
year. 
What 

wasn’t 
expected 
was 
that 

those 
times 

would 
come 

so soon. But 
after falling to 
Vermont 
and 

Dartmouth 
last weekend, 
the Wolverines 
(3-3-1) 
are 

now 
in 
that 

situation.

After 
its 

struggles 
on 

the East Coast, the team will 
now look to right the ship on the 
other side of the country against 
Arizona State (1-7-0), a team in 
just its second year as a program.

Michigan’s 
most 
glaring 

issues this season have come on 
the offensive end of the ice — it 
has been outshot in every game 
this season. The Sun Devils, 
though, have given up at least 
four goals in every game but 
one this season. So if there’s 
any team that can ease the 
Wolverines’ offensive woes, it’s 
Arizona State.

“We know we’ve made way too 

many mistakes to be a good team, 
and way too many mistakes for 
a Michigan team,” said senior 
defenseman Nolan De Jong. “But 
we’re building on the positives 
we had (from last weekend), and 
we’re improving the things that 
we didn’t do as well.”

The bright spot for Michigan 

so far this season has been 
its goaltenders — specifically 
freshmen Jack LaFontaine and 
Hayden Lavigne. Each started a 
game last weekend, and though 
neither earned a win, they both 
faced a minimum of 35 shots 
apiece, and Lavigne set a career 
high with 39 saves.

But the number of shots that 

the goalies have faced this 
season is troubling to say the 
least. Though the netminders 
have been good enough to keep 
their team in games so far, that 
level of play can’t be expected 
to 
last 
all 
season. 
Their 

defensive troubles have led to 
a multitude of line changes and 
goaltender rotations already 
this year, something Michigan 
coach Red Berenson sees as a 
necessity for now.

“We wouldn’t change our 

lines if we were playing really 
well, unless there was an 
injury,” Berenson said. “We 
just don’t think our lines are 
playing well enough to leave 
them together game after game 
or period after period if they’re 
not playing well. We have too 
many growing pains right now 
to just stay with them … I know 
that as a player it’s usually a 
wake-up call when we’d change 
our lines, so I’d have to refocus 
and regroup. Same thing with 

our goalies.”

Michigan realizes it won’t 

be an easy season, and its road 
ahead 
looks 
even 
tougher. 

After the Wolverines return 
from Arizona, they will have 
to prepare for No. 4 Boston 
University. But with its seniors 
leading the way, Michigan has 
a renewed sense of urgency to 
improve quickly.

“(We have the) opportunity 

to put on the Block ‘M’ only 
a finite number of times for 
the rest of the year,” De Jong 
said. “It’s something we’ve got 
to be able to put on the line 
every single night, and I think 
the seniors realize that. We’re 
trying to move that message on 
to younger guys.”

Added Berenson: “We haven’t 

played the kind of hockey that 
I think our players think we 
can play, or the coaches think 
we can play. We’ve got to build 
whatever identity that is. Our 
next game is our best chance to 
take a step in that direction.”

FIELD HOCKEY
Michigan moves into 
Big Ten semifinals

It may have taken 89 minutes 

and 57 seconds, but the No. 10 
Michigan women’s field hockey 
team finally clinched the win 
that will secure it a spot in the 
Big Ten semifinal on Friday.

In 
double 
overtime 
of 

the 
quarterfinal 
match 

against 
Michigan 
State 

(8-12), sophomore midfielder 
Leah Cardarelli scored the 
crucial 
game-winning 
goal 

off an assist from freshman 
midfielder Meg Dowthwaite. 
Dowthwaite gathered the ball 
between the Spartans’ offense 
and sent it to Cardarelli, who 
managed to dribble the ball 
into the circle and send her 
shot past Spartan goalkeeper 
Sierra Patton.

After falling behind early, 

the Wolverines (12-6) initially 
tied the game with only 2:44 
left off a goal from fifth-year 
senior midfielder Esther de 

Leijer at the 67:16 mark. The 
unassisted goal was a rebound 
shot from the top of the circle 
that 
neutralized 
Michigan 

State’s one-goal lead, courtesy 
of Kristin Matula at the 19:30 
mark in the first half.

Despite the Spartans scoring 

first, Michigan dominated in 
shots throughout the game. 
The Wolverines doubled the 
Spartans’ 
shot 
count, 
18-9, 

and also outcornered them, 
8-1. Thanks to this advantage, 
Michigan 
junior 
goalkeeper 

Sam Swenson only needed to 
make four saves as opposed to 
Patton’s 10.

Even though Patton’s defense 

proved strong, it wasn’t enough 
to deter the Wolverines in 
the final minutes of the game. 
Cardarelli’s goal proved fatal 
for the Spartans, as their season 
came to an end in the 2-1 loss.

Michigan’s season, however, 

will continue Friday in the Big 
Ten semifinal against Penn 
State in College Park.

What to Watch For: Armstrong State

Seven months and 17 days ago, 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team’s season ended at the hands 
of Notre Dame in the first round 
of the NCAA Tournament. Now, 
the doors to Crisler Center are set 
to open again, as the Wolverines 
will begin the 2016 season with 
an exhibition against Armstrong 
State on Friday night.

“It’s not the real thing yet, 

but it is time to go out and really 
play against somebody else,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. 
“It’s been a good preseason. I 
wouldn’t say it’s been a great one. 
I watched the video and we have 
some issues, still making similar 
mistakes over and over again. 
We’ve just got to keep cleaning it 
up and cleaning it up.”

Though Michigan may have 

a long way to go before it can 
call itself a complete team, the 
Pirates are an underwhelming 
Division II opponent competing 
in the Peach Belt Conference 
— where they notched a 12-15 
record 
last 
year. 
To 
make 

matters worse, they lost their 
three leading scorers — Herbert 
Graham, Shaquille Mitchell and 
Nicholas Scott — to graduation.

The 
matchup 
is 
more 

compelling given that former 
Wolverine star Cazzie Russell is 
an assistant coach at Armstrong 
State, a small school of about 
7,000 students in Savannah, Ga. 
Regardless, this game has all the 
ingredients for a blowout in favor 
of Michigan.

Even though it’s only an 

exhibition game, there are still 
many questions surrounding the 
Wolverines entering the season. 
Here are four things to look for 
on Friday:

1. Who will thrive at the ‘5’?

Sophomore Moritz Wagner 

and senior Mark Donnal have 

been competing for the starting 
spot at center throughout the 
preseason, and that competition 
is still going strong. According to 
Beilein, Wagner’s skill level and 
shooting ability have currently 
put him ahead of Donnal in the 
quest to assume the starting role.

Still, there are tradeoffs that 

come with Wagner at center. 
Donnal is more experienced, 
a better defender and, most 
importantly, a more effective 
rebounder — something that could 
be paramount for a Michigan 
team which has struggled in that 
category in the past.

Beilein indicated his choice of 

a starter may fluctuate depending 
on what the Wolverines need in 
specific games, but Wagner and 
Donnal’s performances Friday 

night could set the tone for who 
receives the nod going forward.

“I wouldn’t say they’re neck 

and neck,” Beilein said. “But I 
think we’ll know 
in the next couple 
of days who is 
a 
gamer, 
who 

can do things in 
games.”

2. What impact 
will Michigan’s 
freshman class 
have?

The exhibition 

against Armstrong State gives the 
freshman class an opportunity 
to play without losing a year of 
eligibility, and it should serve as 
a barometer for Beilein to judge 

what he has seen in practice so far.

Jon Teske has impressed with 

his basketball IQ and skill set so 
far, and as the Wolverines’ only 

7-footer, his size 
certainly stands 
out. 
Beilein 

touted 
Austin 

Davis 
as 
the 

best 
rebounder 

on 
the 
team 

right 
now 
but 

acknowledged 
he 
still 
needs 

to acclimate to 
the speed of the 
game.

Throughout preseason, Xavier 

Simpson has drawn defensive 
comparisons to senior guard 
Derrick Walton Jr. and will likely 
make the biggest splash as a 

freshman. Beilein has played him 
alongside Walton in scrimmages 
this year, and indicated that he 
likes the option of playing a quick 
defensive lineup with Simpson, 
Walton, redshirt sophomore DJ 
Wilson and senior forward Zak 
Irvin.

Ibi Watson will also be in the 

mix at guard, and Friday night 
could serve as an indication of 
which freshmen could contribute 
immediately this season.

3. How will DJ Wilson look at 
the ‘4’?

Wilson has had a rocky start 

to his career in Ann Arbor, 
redshirting his freshman year after 
suffering an injury and failing to 
carve out playing time for himself 

during his sophomore campaign.

But after a smooth transition 

from center to power forward, 
Beilein suggested that Wilson 
should have significant time on 
the court.

Wilson has grown visibly 

stronger in the offseason, and 
Beilein has seen his new power 
forward reap the benefits.

“We go back two years, and 

I said this to Moritz yesterday, 
that DJ didn’t get a rebound 
ever in practice when he came,” 
Beilein said. “… All of a sudden 
he’s getting traffic rebounds.

“Don’t 
confuse 
him 
with 

Dennis Rodman yet, but he will 
go in and stick his nose in there 
like you’ve never seen him do 
before, and we’re encouraging 
that. That would be a big change, 
if we can rebound and defend out 
of that ‘4’ position. It’s going to be 
huge for us.”

4. Is this the debut of a new-
look defense?

Since assistant coach Billy 

Donlon arrived in Ann Arbor, 
Beilein has placed the bulk of 
the defensive responsibilities on 
his shoulders. Defense has been 
the emphasis this preseason, and 
Friday’s game will be the first 
chance to see how far Michigan 
has 
come 
since 
allowing 

opposing teams to shoot at a 47 
percent clip last season.

Beilein 
is 
hoping 
the 

Wolverines 
can 
be 
more 

aggressive in forcing turnovers 
and better dictate how the 
opposing offense plays. Donlon 
is trying to more effectively 
strike a balance between foul 
trouble and smart fouls this 
season, so don’t be surprised to 
see Michigan be more physical 
on the defensive end.

The Pirates are far from the 

perfect measuring stick, but the 
matchup could shed some light 
on the Wolverines’ defensive 
approach going forward.

Sophomore forward Moritz Wagner has proven to be Michigan’s best big man, and that could edge him into the starting lineup over Mark Donnal on Friday night.

Sophomore guard Nicole Munger paced the Michigan women’s basketball team’s offense with 16 points on 4-for-4 3-point shooting in Thursday night’s exhibition.

‘M’ wins exhibition at Crisler

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team had talked about its 
high expectations and significant 
improvements for weeks before 
it faced off against Division II 
foe Wayne 
State in a 
season-
opening 
exhibition Thursday night.

And when they finally hit the 

court, the Wolverines backed 
up their talk with a 93-41 
beatdown over the Warriors. 
Michigan took a 14-5 lead 
early in the first quarter before 
Wayne State called its first 
timeout. From that point on, 
Michigan kept its foot on the 
gas pedal all game long.

“We had our little jitters,” 

said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 

Barnes Arico. “I think we 
played nervous at times. But 
it was a great opportunity to 
get out there and play against 
another team.”

Many 
Wolverines 
picked 

up right where they left off 
last season, with junior guard 
Katelynn Flaherty socing a 
team-high 17 points. Flaherty 
also flashed her passing ability 
with three assists, including one 
pass in the third quarter that 
split two defenders and set up 
sophomore center Hallie Thome 
for a low-post bucket.

Senior guard Siera Thompson 

exhibited her leadership on the 
court, flirting with a triple-
double with 12 points, five 
boards, and eight assists.

But 
the 
exhibition 
game 

also provided an opportunity 
to stand out for some of the 
players who may not usually be 
in the spotlight. Junior forward 
Jillian Dunston, who started 
nine games last season and 
got the nod Thursday, shined 
in particular. She crashed the 
boards all night, tallying 12 total 
in addition to her eight points on 
4-for-6 shooting.

Sophomore 
guard 
Nicole 

Munger showed her range off 

the bench, going 4-for-4 beyond 
the arc and scoring 16 points, 
adding five rebounds. Munger 
credits 
her 
teammates 
for 

finding her when she was open, 
and Barnes Arico was impressed 
with her energy on the court.

“Nicole was a spark coming 

off the bench for us,” Barnes 
Arico said. “We were struggling 
with a couple of people making 
shots, and she came in and she 
was instant offense for us. But 
not only that, she was scrappy 
all over the place. Loose balls, 
second-chance opportunities.”

All 
of 
Michigan’s 
highly 

touted freshman class saw action 
as well. Standout freshman 
guard Kysre Gondrezick battled 
nerves in her first collegiate 
game, shooting 2-for-12 and 
1-for-6 from the free-throw 
line, but other freshmen showed 
promise. 
Akienreh 
Johnson 

scored 
three 
points 
and 

gathered three rebounds in just 
eight minutes on the court.

While 
the 
Wolverines 

dominated nearly every facet 
of the game, both Dunston 
and Barnes Arico agreed that 
improvements needed to made 
on the defensive end and at 
the 
free-throw 
line, 
where 

Michigan shot just 55.5 percent. 
 

“I think we definitely are 

a better free-throwing team 
tonight than everybody saw,” 
Barnes Arico said. “I was really 
pleased with the amount of times 
we got to the line. Now we got to 
be able to knock those out.”

Added Dunston: “I think our 

defense will have to close the 
gap. Even though they didn’t 
score as many points as us, we 
have to take pride in our defense 
and we didn’t do that. We’re 
gonna have to improve. If we 
don’t do it in games like these, 
then we’re gonna be screwed.”

Dunston, Munger provide spark

As the Michigan women’s 

basketball 
team 
took 
on 

Division II Wayne State for 
its first exhibition matchup 
Thursday night, a few familiar 
faces lit up the court. The 
Wolverines 
crushed 
the 

Warriors, 93-41, with heavy 
assistance from junior forward 
Jillian Dunston and sophomore 
guard Nicole Munger.

Dunston provided a dynamic 

rebounding presence with four 
offensive and eight defensive 
boards, making her the only 
Wolverine to break into double 
digits combined for the game. 
She put up eight points as well, 
but her defensive play gave 
Michigan the impact it needed.

“Rebounding gets us more 

possessions, 
offensively 
and 

defensively,” Dunston said. “It 

limits their possessions and gets 
us more possessions. I think as 
long as I can do that for my team 
… that helps us a lot.”

Added Michigan coach Kim 

Barnes Arico: “She’s just a 
rebounding machine, all over 
the place, and much more 
confident on the offensive end, 
which is something we really 
need from her.”

As 
an 
upperclassman, 

Dunston is taking on more of a 
leadership role than she has in 
the past, which, combined with 
her on-court play, places her in a 
vital role for the Wolverines.

“She’s playing so much more 

confidently,” 
Barnes 
Arico 

said. “This is her team. When 
she was younger, she was 
always looking up to others. 
Now, she has to lead the 
younger girls. And she’s doing 
a great job.”

Munger stood out against the 

Warriors as well, hitting the 
court for just six minutes in the 
first half, but tallying 11 points 
— including a streak of three 
3-pointers. She added five more 
in the second half, earning 
more playing time as the game 
went on.

“(Munger) was scrappy, all 

over the place,” Arico said. 
“Loose 
balls, 
second-chance 

opportunities. 
She’s 
another 

player that is a gym rat and 
works incredibly hard. I think 
we’re going to see great seasons 
from both of them.”

Only junior guard Katelynn 

Flaherty, who was recently 
named to the preseason All-
Big Ten team, scored more 
than Munger, finishing with 17 
points.

“It was my teammates that 

were finding me,” Munger said. 
“Some nights just go better than 
others. It was really great that 
my teammates were finding 
me and honestly, I just want to 
thank them.”

Neither Dunston nor Munger 

were starters last year, but 
each of their performances has 
warranted serious consideration 
for starting positions this season 
if they can keep up the pace 
they set tonight. Wayne State 
gave the Wolverines a perfect 
opportunity to shake off nerves 
and re-acclimate to a level of 
intensity that practices simply 
cannot simulate, but it was far 
from a challenging opponent for 
Michigan. As the Wolverines 
move 
on 
to 
face 
tougher 

competition, both players will 
need to continue exceling in 
their roles.

“Nothing is really solidified 

until the day of the game,” 
Dunston said. “You kind of have 
to continue to prove yourself. 
You can never relax.”

With big names like Flaherty 

and sophomore Hallie Thome 
to compete with, Dunston and 
Munger have no time to sit on 
their heels. They have shown 
that they can be definite assets, 
and now it’s up to them to earn 
those coveted starting spots.

Michigan prepares for Durkin, Maryland

The No. 3 Michigan football 

team knocked off its in-state rival 
last weekend for the first time in 
four years, and 
though the game 
wasn’t 
pretty, 

the third-ranked 
Wolverines 
thoroughly 
enjoyed it.

The struggling 

Spartans (0-5 Big 
Ten, 2-6 overall) 
played 
one 
of 

their best games 
of 
the 
season, 

outscoring 
Michigan 
14-5 

in 
the 
fourth 

quarter 
and 

outgaining 
it 
217-192 
on 
the 

ground. It still wasn’t enough, 
as the Wolverines escaped East 
Lansing with the Paul Bunyan 
Trophy, which now sits in Ann 
Arbor, adorned with miniature 
maize pants and a Michigan hat.

Still, many defensive players, 

including 
senior 
cornerback 

Jourdan 
Lewis, 
voiced 
their 

displeasure with the fact they 
allowed the Spartans to get back 
in the game. The Wolverines (5-0, 
8-0) allowed themselves to enjoy 
the rivalry win, but their goals 
evidently aren’t stopping there.

With 
hopes 
of 
a 
Big 
Ten 

Championship and a spot in the 
College Football Playoff very much 
alive, Michigan still has work to be 
done, starting Saturday when former 
defensive coordinator DJ Durkin 
returns to Ann Arbor as a first-year 
head coach at Maryland (2-3, 5-3).

“I think he’s doing a fabulous 

job, him and his entire staff and 
team,” said Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh. “You can see the energy. 
You see the strength. You see the 
competitiveness and execution on 
the field, et cetera. The flip side of 
that is we know that this’ll be a big 
game, a championship game. This 
will be a real test for our club.”

Under Durkin last season, the 

Wolverines’ defense posted three 
straight shutouts and allowed the 
fourth-fewest yards per game in 
the country. This year, under new 
defensive coordinator Don Brown, 
that unit has improved to first in 
that category as well as first in 
points per game.

Though 
his 
position 
group 

struggled more than usual in 
stopping the run last week, defensive 
line coach Greg Mattison feels like 
they’ve handled the regular-season 
grind well enough to be ready for the 
November stretch.

“There starts to become a wear-

and-tear, maybe, throughout that 
long stretch,” he said. “But our head 
coach is pretty smart. This isn’t his 
first trip. He knows how to set up 
practice and how to do things, and 
Coach Brown knows exactly what 
this defense needs.”

On the other side of the ball, 

Michigan’s offense had perhaps 
its best single-half performance of 
the season against Michigan State, 
starting with redshirt sophomore 
quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

answering a Spartan touchdown 
drive with a 3:23 scoring drive 
of his own. Speight continues to 
improve week to week, and he has 
thrown 13 touchdowns against just 
three interceptions.

This week, the Wolverines have 

the advantage of preparing for a 
familiar defense. Beyond Harbaugh’s 
relationship with Durkin, defensive 
coordinator Andy Buh worked with 
the pair at Stanford, and linebackers 
coach Matt Barnes was a defensive 

analyst for the Wolverines last year.

Though Harbaugh identified a 

few schemes and a “hustle” that he 
recognized on film, neither he nor 
offensive coordinator Tim Drevno 
are expecting preparation to be 
easy. Drevno pointed out that Buh 
is bringing his own flavor to his 
new team, and no two defenses end 
up looking the same.

“I think you always kind of build 

your football team around what you 
have personnel-wise and what they 
do best to put them in successful 
situations,” Drevno said. “You might 
see something different out there 
that caters to them to be successful.”

The Terrapins might not have 

the pieces to pull off an upset, 
though — star cornerback Will 
Likely is lost for the season with a 
torn ACL, and Maryland’s defense 
is fresh off allowing 42 points at 
Indiana. Last year, Michigan shut 
out the Terrapins, 28-0, on the 
road, and six of the Wolverines’ 
eight victories this year have been 
by double digits.

As he has every week, Harbaugh 

said Monday that this game will 
be treated like a championship 
game, but the 31-point underdog 
Terrapins look like a long shot to 
capture the title.

GRANT HARDY/Daily


The Michigan Stadium press 

box will open at 12:30 p.m. 
Saturday, as it always does. But 
it won’t ever be the same again.

Last Friday, Michigan lost 

one of its most beloved behind-
the-scenes figures when Dean 
Cook, a member of Michigan’s 
event staff who had become a 
fixture at football, basketball, 
soccer and other games in Ann 
Arbor over the past decade, 
passed away at the age of 58.

Dean wasn’t one of the 

more publicized faces of the 
Wolverines — save for a snippet 
in a Players’ Tribune article 
last December, his work rarely 
landed him in the limelight. That 
didn’t stop him from being one 
of the brightest personalities 
in the room, though. Dean 
never hesitated to strike up a 
conversation with anyone — 
fellow event staff members, 
reporters, 
broadcasters, 

coaches and players all came 
to recognize and appreciate his 
presence.

His 
impact 
on 
those 

people was undeniable. An 
outpouring 
of 
appreciation 

flowed on Twitter following his 
passing, with former Michigan 
basketball star Caris LeVert 
being one of the many people 
who joined in.

“RIP to my guy Deano,” 

LeVert tweeted. “Always had 
the same positive energy no 
matter what. Michigan man 
that will truly be missed!”

Sunday, 
the 
men’s 
and 

women’s soccer teams took the 
pitch sporting black armbands 
in memory of Dean. Redshirt 
sophomore goalkeeper Sarah 
Jackson wrote “Win 4 Dean” 
on her arm in black marker. 
“He was just a huge part of our 
team,” she said, “and we really 
miss him here.”

Most of us met Dean as 

sophomores, just starting out 
our Daily careers. Now, as 
seniors, we are struck by the 
loss of the man who knew our 
names long before any of us 
knew his. We were fortunate 
to experience Dean’s famous 
pre-game fist bumps both in the 
Crisler Center press section and 
at Michigan Stadium, and we’ve 
seen firsthand what kind of 
impact Dean had on the people 
he came in contact with in Ann 
Arbor.

Over the last week, we 

tracked down just a few of the 
many people Dean has touched 
to give them an opportunity to 
share their memories.

John Beilein, Michigan men’s 

basketball coach:

Here’s what I loved about 

Dean: After every win, as he 
walked me around to all my 
(media) things for several years 
now, he had a swag. He had the 
same swag that I would have 
after a win. It was like he loved 
the win as much as I did. And if 
we lost — emotionally, we were 
in the exact same place after 
a game. That was always fun 
for me, to be able to talk with 
him and just have fun with 
him in those settings, in that 
environment.

Alma Davila-Toro, Michigan 

event staff: 

Dean may have taken his last 

breath last week, but he will 
always be remembered. A part 
of him made me feel at home 
because it reminded me of the 
men who raised me in Harlem. 
Dean’s swag will be missed 
on this team! His a-Maize-ing 
spirit will live on. Dean, you 
are and forever will be true 
blue, through and through! The 
Events Team loves you, Deano!

Matt Shepard, Michigan 

men’s basketball play-by-play 

announcer: 

At Crisler Center, the home 

announcers sit down the row 
from the visiting announcers. 
It’s a close-knit fraternity in 
the Big Ten. Though he never 
wore a headset, Dean Cook was 
part of our broadcast team. He 
was part of that fraternity, and 
every broadcast crew in the 
conference knew it.

Dean took care of us all. 

Whatever we needed — box 
scores, 
water, 
Diet 
Coke, 

Internet assistance, you name 
it — Dean either helped provide 
it or found someone who could 
help. I made sure every time a 
visiting crew came to Crisler, 
they knew three things: the 
closest bathroom, the media 
meal room, and I made sure 
they were introduced to Deano. 
EVERY crew left that building 
feeling they were Dean’s best 
friend. EVERY crew would tell 
me after their broadcast how 
their experience at Michigan 
was enhanced because of Dean.

He represented our broadcast 

team, 
Michigan 
basketball 

and the University with class 
and enthusiasm. His passion 
for Michigan was unmatched. 
When we visited opposing 
arenas, 
broadcasters 
would 

show us the same courtesies we 
show them in Ann Arbor, but 
they always had a caveat: “But 
we don’t have a Dean.”

Every home game, I hugged 

him and thanked him for what 
he did for us. And every road 
game, I wished he traveled with 
us.

His death has left Terry 

Mills, engineer Tony Butler and 
I with an emptiness that will 
be impossible to fill. Games at 
Crisler won’t be the same for 
us. We’ll miss his winks after 
a great Michigan play and his 
scowl when things don’t go the 
Wolverines’ way. But, most of 
all, we’ll miss his infectious 
laugh and contagious smile.

We loved you, Dean, and we 

miss you.

Tom Wywrot, Michigan 
men’s basketball sports 
information director: 

I don’t even know how to 

put it into words how much 
I’m gonna miss him. He was 
THE guy. I think I come off as 
a very happy-go-lucky person 
and I like to try to have fun, 
but he topped me. He always 
made every game fun. He was a 
shadow that I never really asked 
for, but he was always there and 
I came to rely on him so much. 
I grew so fond of him that if he 
didn’t come to a game, I was like, 
“Oh man, what am I gonna do?”

He was such an energetic and 

caring person — not necessarily 
for Michigan, even though we 
know his love for Michigan — 
but just the care that he had 
for people. Coach, the players, 
the fans, anyone around him 
— it was infectious, and it was 
something that I try to and will 
continue to aspire to. Every day, 
he made me think life is fun. 
This is fun, what I do for a living 
is fun. To me, heaven got the 
most fun person in the world. 
He’s going to be sorely missed.

I’ve known him for years, and 

I was just starting to get to know 
him more off the court or away 
from here. He was the same — 
every day, every place — and 
that was inspiring.

Dave Ablauf and Chad 

Shepard, Michigan football 
sports information directors:

Dean was not just a valued 

family member of the staff that 
puts on athletic events at the 
University of Michigan. He was 
one of the friendliest individuals 
you’d ever meet, in any walk of 
life. He was a friend to everyone 
he came in contact with, and 
his passion and enthusiasm for 
where he was and the people 
he was working with became 
contagious. You may not have 
always been glad to be at an 
event, but if you were there, you 
were glad that Dean was there 
with you.

He bled Maize and Blue and 

had a tangible, infectious energy 
about him that can never be 
replaced. Dean treated everyone 
with respect — from the top-
level national broadcast crews 

to the radio teams from Division 
II schools that we played in 
exhibition 
contests. 
From 

interacting with student beat 
writers and volunteer stadium 
cleanup crews to entertaining 
Hall of Fame broadcasters and 
celebrity guests, Dean was 
someone that we always felt 
proud to have representing 
Michigan Athletics.

One 
great 
memory 
of 

Dean was when the Crisler 
Center event staff organized 
a choreographed dance and 
performed it on the floor during 
a media timeout. Dean said he 
was nervous beforehand, but 
when it came time to dance, 
that energy we became used to 
seeing every day in his words 
and smile was visible for 12,000 
fans at Crisler to see. Dean was 
known for his high-fives and 
giving pounds, but when he 

made it back up to the media 
section of the arena, we were 
all giving him high-fives and 
pounds.

He had a smile on his face 

every day, and never, ever felt 
sorry for himself, but his smile 
that day was as big as ever. Dean 
worked hard, but he loved and 
laughed harder. And we will 
miss him every day.

beat writer, MLive.com: 
Like a lot of people, I first met 

Dean during basketball games 
at Crisler. I’ve met hundreds, 
maybe thousands, of people 
working games at Michigan 
over the years. But no one like 
Dean. No one who took the time

to get to know people the way he 
did. Reporters, staffers, coaches, 
players, 
fans, 
custodians, 

whatever — everyone knew 
Dean and we all adored him. I’ll 
miss his laugh, his kindness and 
his fist bumps. RIP, buddy. No 
press area at Michigan will be 
the same.

Brendan Quinn, Michigan 
beat writer, MLive.com: 
The 
doldrums 
of 
the 

basketball season are a cold, 
dark time. Everyone is tired. 
The days are long and everyone 
wants to see the winter come 
mercifully to an end. That’s 
why I loved seeing Dean every 
few days at Crisler. He seemed 
to live in a forcefield of positive 
energy. He’d hit me with it every 

game: “Yo, B!” That vigor. That 
punch of life.

Dean had it and owned it and 

shared it with everyone. I fed off 
it. He was a human pick-me-up, 
a reminder to find time to laugh 
and smile. I always enjoyed 
our pregame chats and busting 
chops. He was the best and he 
will be terribly missed by those 
who he worked to help, never 
asking for thanks. Crisler will 
be a colder place this season, but 
we’ll all be sure to keep Dean in 
the back of our minds.

He’ll still brighten the day.
Thank you for sharing Dean 

with us. I hope you find peace 
in knowing how beloved he was.

Regards, 
and 
deepest 

condolences,

Brendan Quinn

Mark Snyder, Michigan beat 
writer, Detroit Free Press: 
Dean was an irrepressible 

man, full of joy and excitement. 
He saw the gamut of Michigan 
sports 
from 
extraordinary 

highs to the low points in these 
programs’ histories. Yet he 
was always energized, always 
optimistic, always confident. 
My 
favorite 
Dean 
moment 

came every February when he 
and the other ushers would do 
their yearly dance during one 
of the final home basketball 
games. Every year he’d joke that 
he hoped to make it through, 
and every time he had the 
biggest grin out there. Whether 
wearing a Santa hat or trying 
to follow the dance steps, Dean 
was always happy. That’s what 
I’ll remember.

Simon Kaufman, former 
Daily men’s basketball 

writer: 

I always liked covering 

games at Crisler the best. 
Going to games on the road 
was fun — a lot of arenas had 
better atmospheres or louder 
fans — but none had Dean. 
Dean made you feel at home. 
He did that with everyone. He 
made you feel like a friend even 
if he had just met you. Before 
every game, I looked forward 
to walking up to the press 
seating area and seeing Dean. 
“Si-MOAN!” he’d say. He knew 
everyone by name, and your 
name sounded better when he 
said it. And then we’d share 
a pregame fist bump. I think 
Dean knew he was cool, but 
he might not have known how 
cool he made me and others 
feel.

Daniel Wasserman, former 

Daily men’s basketball 

writer: 

I’ll admit that as news of 

Dean’s tragic passing spread, 
I was a bit surprised at the 
outpouring of tweets that came 
from all angles of the Michigan 
Athletic Department and press 
corps. And not because he 
lacked personality; Dean, or 
Deano as I knew him, had the 
charisma, the energy, the smile, 
and yes, the dance moves, 
to light up not just a room, 
but an entire Crisler Center. 
But with people as gracious 
and genuine as him, it never 
dawned on me that I was only 
one of hundreds of people that 
he touched — or fist bumped 
— every day he came to work. 
He was that special type that 
made everyone feel uniquely 
special. It wasn’t part of his job 
description. It was just who he 
was.

Dean loved Michigan and 

loved the people who covered 
it. He knew our names, asked 
us questions, wished us luck on 
our exams and made us smile. 
The little things. A fist bump on 
our way up to press row. A mid-
game water bottle. A fist bump 
on our way down after the 
game. “I’ll see you next week,” 
he’d say, and always, “Go Blue.”

In my first game back to 

Crisler after graduating, I 
made a trip up to the press 
area, sections 201 & 202. I 
went to see old colleagues and 
friends from the beat: the Daily 
guys, Nick and Quinn, Rod and 

Snyder, and my man Deano. He 
was there, waiting with a fist 
bump, as if I had never left. I 
gave him a hug. I haven’t been 
to Crisler since; the next time 
won’t be same.

We can’t all be fast and 

strong or return to campus to 
coach our football team, but 
every one of us can learn a 
thing or two from Deano about 
what it means to be a Michigan 
Man.

Max Bultman, Daily football 

writer: 

The first time Dean called 

me by name and offered me 
one of his famed fist bumps, 
I remember feeling so much 
more 
important 
than 
I’ve 

ever had reason to feel as a 
journalist. 
Dean 
had 
that 

effect on people. Whether or 
not you know who he was, he 
went out of his way to welcome 
you. The outpouring of sorrow 
after he passed is a testament 
to how impactful that was to 
so many. I’ll never forget his 
quick flash of a smile when 
he saw someone coming — it 
really could have been anyone 
— and how quickly he stuck 
out his knuckles. Even on the 
most tense, stressful days, it 
was enough to turn your mood 
around. I’ll miss that presence 
when I walk into the press 
box on Saturday, but I have 
no doubt Dean will be looking 
down on us, with that stadium-
light smile as bright as ever, 
sticking out his fist from above.

Jake Lourim, Daily football 

writer: 

With 
any 
game-day 

experience at Michigan, there 
are so many feelings that go 
into making it an enjoyable 
experience. At every event 
where we were lucky enough 
to have Dean, his enthusiasm, 
spirit and compassion stood 
out above all else. I’ll never 
forget the first time he called 
my name out down press row 
— he’d do it with everyone, 
every game.

I always looked forward 

to those moments. It was 
amazing how Dean, all by 
himself, could brighten up 
the mood of any venue, no 
matter how big. Michigan has 
lost one of its most beloved 
figures, and the world has lost 
one of its kindest souls. The 

press box will never be the 
same without him. Thanks for 
everything, Deano.

Jacob Gase, Daily football 

writer: 

During my sophomore and 

junior years at the Daily, I 
spent two or three days a week 
in the press box at Crisler 
Center covering the women’s 
and men’s basketball teams. 
No matter whether I was 
covering an exhibition game 
that drew just a handful of fans 
or a sold-out matchup with 
Michigan State, the one thing I 
could count on was that Dean 
would be there to give me my 
pre-game fist bump.

Especially as a sophomore 

writer who felt in over his 
head covering his first beat, 
Dean was always a calming 
presence. His positive attitude, 
his constant presence, and his 
ability to treat everyone with 
equal kindness made me feel 
great every time I showed up 
at the arena. It’s not that hard 
to learn someone’s name in the 
press box — everyone literally 
walks around with their name 
and photo on a press packs 
around their necks — but the 
fact that he made the effort 
to read and remember my 
name made me feel important 
somehow.

Dean made an inexperienced 

19-year-old feel welcome, and 
he made everyone he came 
in contact with feel like his 
friend. I’ll never forget that 
about him. Rest easy, buddy.

Kelly Hall, Daily football 

writer: 

I first met Dean during my 

sophomore year as a women’s 
basketball beat writer. I wish I 
had expressed it to him, but he 
was undeniably a bright spot 
of every game I covered at 
Crisler Center and Michigan 
Stadium. He knew my name 
before I knew his, calling me 
“Kel” without missing a beat 
just weeks into my coverage 
of dub hoops. He made me feel 
like family with his fist-bumps 
and continued interest in my 
life, and he taught me that a 
single person can brighten 
hundreds of people’s days 
with a simple greeting and 
smile.

RIP, Dean.

Breakdown: Michigan vs. Maryland

The Michigan football team’s 

home-heavy 
schedule 
has 
the 

Wolverines back at the Big House 
this weekend.

There, they have won six straight 

games by a combined score of 263-
70. They have trailed for just 27:50, 
all in the Colorado game on Sept. 17. 
They have suddenly beaten three 
top-15 teams — No. 15 Colorado, No. 
12 Penn State and No. 8 Wisconsin 
— according to the first College 
Football Playoff rankings released 
Tuesday night.

Michigan lost twice on its home 

field last season, but has not done so 
yet this year. The Wolverines have 
two more chances to play in front of 
the largest crowd in college football, 
the first coming this weekend 
against an upstart Maryland team 
(5-3) looking to become bowl-
eligible after a 3-9 finish last season.

Once again Michigan is a heavy 

favorite, expected to deliver a 
performance as dominant as the ones 
it has put on already this year. Here’s 
how this week’s matchup looks:

Michigan 
rush 
offense 
vs. 

Maryland rush defense

Michigan’s ground game took 

another big step forward last 
weekend. The Wolverines racked 
up 192 rushing yards against 
Michigan State at 4.6 per carry, 
a number that — like the score — 
was stained by a lackluster fourth 
quarter. For most of the first three 
quarters, they gashed the Spartans’ 
front, marching toward six scoring 
drives in seven series, though three 
ended in field goals.

Michigan’s 
rushing 
leaders 

look similar, with senior De’Veon 
Smith, freshman Chris Evans and 
sophomore Karan Higdon each over 
400 yards on the season. The leading 
rusher last week was freshman 
wide receiver Eddie McDoom with 
53 yards, and redshirt sophomore 
Jabrill Peppers finished fourth with 
24. He has seen more time at wildcat 
quarterback in recent weeks, and 
the Wolverines might use all of their 
tricks in the final third of the season 
to make their case for the College 
Football Playoff.

Maryland’s 
rush 
defense, 

meanwhile, took a big step backward 
last weekend. The Terrapins couldn’t 
handle Indiana’s up-tempo spread 
offense, giving up 414 yards on 57 
carries. The Hoosiers had three 100-

yard rushers and 650 total yards in a 
42-36 victory in Bloomington.

That 
performance 
dropped 

Maryland to 108th in the country in 
rush defense at 220.1 yards per game, 
the kind of front that Michigan 
typically 
steamrolls. 
But 
both 

sides will know a little more about 
the other than usual, with former 
Michigan defensive coordinator D.J. 
Durkin coming in as the head coach 
of the Terrapins. He’ll be familiar 
with the Wolverines’ scheme from 
last year, though Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh can say the same.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Maryland pass defense

One of Michigan’s more curious 

stats is its national ranking in 
passing yards — 71st, at 228.1 per 
game. A major reason is that the 
Wolverines have played almost only 
blowouts this season and haven’t 
needed to throw the ball downfield.

If 
redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback Wilton Speight finds 
himself in a situation where he 
needs to pick up some yards 
through the air, he knows who to 
look for. Fifth-year senior wideout 
Amara Darboh’s eight catches for 

165 yards against Michigan State 
gave him a big lead as the team’s top 
receiver with 664 yards.

Speight has been consistent all 

year with just three interceptions, 
and turnovers shouldn’t be an issue 
Saturday against a Maryland defense 
with just four picks on the year. But 
in many other areas, the Terrapins 
already look like a Durkin defense 
with 27 pass breakups. They have 
also given up just 181.4 yards per 
game, good for 18th in the country 
and a strength of the team. This 
will be one of the toughest defensive 
backfields Michigan has faced.

Edge: Maryland

Maryland 
rush 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan rush defense

Maryland’s 
rushing 
attack 

might be even more diverse than 
Michigan’s. It’s a toss-up: The 
Wolverines feature four different 
running backs, a speedy wide receiver 
and a linebacker, while the Terrapins 
roll out three running backs, a wide 
receiver and two quarterbacks.

Ty Johnson is the Terrapins’ 

leading rusher with 624 yards. He 
is the big-play threat, averaging 10.4 
yards per carry and breaking loose 
for a 66-yard touchdown last week 

at Indiana. Lorenzo Harrison is the 
workhorse, with the most carries 
(79) for 575 yards.

Kenneth Goins is a 5-foot-9, 233-

pound bruising back, and Maryland 
also has Jake Funk and Wes Brown 
as backups. The team’s depth chart 
this week lists five players with an 
“OR” between each one, and Trey 
Edmunds might be a sixth if he 
hadn’t broken his foot last month. 
In all, Maryland ranks 12th in the 
country with 252 yards per game.

The 
Wolverines 
should 
be 

prepared, though. Expect their 
defense to correct the mistakes 
that helped Michigan State become 
the second team this season to 
rush for more than 100 yards 
against Michigan. Despite that, the 
Wolverines still rank 15th in the 
country in rush defense and have 
piled up 71 tackles for loss from 
18 different players. They should 
come out fired up after seeing what 
happened last week, and Maryland 
hasn’t seen a defense of that caliber.

Edge: Michigan

Maryland 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan pass defense

Maryland’s passing statistics are 

skewed a bit by the injuries to Hills, 

who didn’t play against Minnesota 
on Oct. 15 and missed parts of other 
games, too. The Terrapins threw 
for a season-high 248 yards against 
Indiana, and they’re much more 
of a threat with Hills in the game 
than with the run-first Pigrome. At 
the end of the day, this is a run-first 
team, too, with 351 rushes against 
just 205 passes.

Some creative play-calling might 

be the Terrapins’ best shot against 
a stifling defense. Michigan’s top-
ranked secondary again forced 
its opponent to use multiple 
quarterbacks in last week’s game. 
That unit, led by senior All-
American Jourdan Lewis, also 
deserves most of the credit for the 
Wolverines’ sterling performance 
on third down. Opponents are 
converting 
a 
nation-low 
15.5 

percent of their opportunities, in 
large part because of Michigan’s 
lock-down defense.

Last year, that defense completed 

its second of three straight shutouts 
in Week 5 against Maryland, 
intercepting 
three 
passes 
and 

overwhelming quarterbacks Caleb 
Rowe and Daxx Garman. In that 
game, Michigan’s defense held 
down a slim lead until a struggling 
offense managed 28 points in the 
end. This year, with the Wolverines

clicking all-around, the defense 
might have it easier.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

This space in almost every 

installment of this preview this 
year has discussed how Michigan’s 
opponent has not had a playmaker 
to match Peppers. Maryland did 
have that in decorated senior Will 
Likely — until Likely tore his ACL 
on Oct. 15, ending his career.

We would have looked forward 

to seeing Peppers and Likely duel in 
the return game, but it now appears 
that Michigan has a significant 
edge. Peppers is still a major threat 
on punts and kickoffs, and few 
know that better than Durkin, so 
perhaps the Terrapins will choose 
to kick away from the Heisman 
Trophy candidate on the other side. 
Even in that case, Michigan often 
ends up with good field position.

The Wolverines’ special teams 

are back in rhythm, too. Fifth-year 
senior kicker Kenny Allen’s three 
field goals last week made him 9-for-
13, and his punting never wavered. 
Maryland kicker Adam Greene is 
6-for-8 with a long of just 36, and 
Durkin has sent out the kicking team 
just twice in the past five games.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles

Maryland defensive end Roman 

Braglio told reporters in College 
Park this week that Durkin brought 
up the possibility of beating the 
Associated Press’ No. 2 team in 
the country, and Braglio said the 
thought gave him chills.

In that way, Saturday’s game 

could be like many others Michigan 
has played: The Wolverines will 
treat it like any other, while their 
upset-hungry opponent will play like 
it’s the biggest game of their season. 
Durkin will want a strong showing 
against his former boss, and in his 
first matchup against one of the top 
dogs in the Big Ten East, he’ll want 
his team to be competitive at least.

But even as the hype has picked 

up steam, Michigan hasn’t missed a 
beat. This week’s motivation could be 
the College Football Playoff rankings 
that came out this week, putting 
the Wolverines at No. 3 and in the 
playoff if the season ended now. The 
Wolverines may not treat this game 
differently, but they have plenty to 
play for in their home stadium.

Edge: Push

Prediction: Michigan 41, 
Maryland 15

What to Watch For: Durkin’s return, 
Butt’s resurgence, Peppers, defense

The Michigan football season 

is now two-thirds complete, and 
the Wolverines find themselves 
firmly in control of their own 
destiny.

After debuting at No. 3 in the 

first College Football Playoff 
rankings of 2016, Michigan has 
a clear path to the playoff if it 
wins out. But winning out is no 
guarantee.

While the Wolverines should 

be favored in each of the three 
games prior to a road showdown 
at No. 6 Ohio State, they’ll have 
to take care of business to reach 
that game intact. That quest 
starts Saturday, when they host 
a rebuilt Maryland team manned 
by former Michigan defensive 
coordinator DJ Durkin.

Here’s what to watch for when 

the teams take the field Saturday.

1. What does Durkin have up 
his sleeve?

Just one year removed from 

coaching 
every 
starter 
on 

Michigan’s 
current 
defense, 

Durkin has the benefit of knowing 
some of the tendencies of most 
Wolverine starters. He could try 
to exploit those tendencies, but 
it’s far from a guarantee any flaws 
the Wolverines had under Durkin 
will still be present Saturday.

Under 
Don 
Brown, 
the 

Wolverines’ defense has reached 
new heights, currently leading 
the nation in both scoring and 
total defense.

It wouldn’t be a surprise 

for Durkin to come out with a 
specially tailored game plan 
to attack certain facets of the 
Michigan defense. It might be a 
surprise if it works.

2. Will Butt be more involved?

After racking up 15 catches for 

192 yards and three touchdowns 
in the Wolverines’ first three 
games, Butt has totaled just 
seven for 80 yards and a score 
in their last three. It’s not that 
Butt has been doing anything 
wrong — he caught a deep pass 
against the Spartans — but he 
hasn’t been the late-down safety 
blanket he was at the season’s 

outset.

Part of that, to be sure, can be 

attributed to the emergence of 
fifth-year senior receiver Amara 
Darboh, and part seems tied 
to the fact that Speight hasn’t 
needed a safety blanket. But 
Michigan’s offense is at its most 
dangerous when Butt is heavily 
involved.

3. Jabrill Peppers’ Heisman 
campaign

Ever 
since 
he 
unleashed 

Peppers against Rutgers last 
month, Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh has been putting his 
do-it-all 
redshirt 
sophomore 

in more positions to make 
highlight plays.

While 
Illinois 
seemed 
to 

have Peppers snuffed out all 
game, the multi-position star 
made his impact felt in a big 
way against Michigan State 
with 
a 
rushing 
touchdown, 

defensive two-point conversion, 
two tackles for loss and a sack. 
Durkin knows exactly how good 
Peppers is, but knowing might 
not be enough.

Harbaugh 
has 
publicly 

stumped for Peppers to win the 
Heisman Trophy, but if he’s going 
to overtake Louisville’s Lamar 
Jackson, Peppers will need to do 
more than just make big hits and 
score the occasional touchdown.

Expect Peppers to take his 

usual wildcat quarterback reps 
in the red zone, and maybe even 

throw a pass out of the formation 
for the first time all season.

4. Will the defense respond to a 
down week?

After giving up 401 total yards 

and two late touchdowns against 
Michigan State last week, the 
Michigan defense will be out to 
prove that performance was an 
anomaly.

Behind a litany of missed 

tackles that had players displeased 
after the game, the Wolverines 
allowed the Spartans to crawl back 
into a game that was 30-10 halfway 
through 
the 
fourth 
quarter. 

Saturday, Maryland could either 
take advantage of that or be the 
victim of a vicious rebound effect.

Behind Enemy Lines: DJ Durkin

This 
weekend, 
Michigan 

coach Jim Harbaugh will battle a 
familiar face.

DJ 
Durkin, 
who 
was 
the 

defensive coordinator at Michigan 
last season, is in his first head 
coaching job at Maryland, and 
Harbaugh has been impressed 
with the work he’s done so far.

After struggling to a 3-9 season 

in 2015, the Terrapins are off to 
a much more successful 2016. 
More than halfway through the 
season, Durkin is 5-3 with two 
Big Ten wins.

“He’s done a fabulous job,” 

Harbaugh 
said 
Monday. 
“Just 

always 
respected 
DJ 
as 
a 

tremendous 
competitor 
at 
the 

highest level — smile thinking 
about his competitiveness, and also 
always happy for a friend’s success.”

The Daily spoke with Durkin 

at Big Ten Football Media Days in 
July about Harbaugh, his new gig 
and moving to Maryland.

Question: What are you pitching 

to recruits at Maryland now that 
maybe 
wasn’t 
pitched 
before? 

You’re off to a pretty nice start, 
better than the previous three or 
four Maryland classes started out.

DJ Durkin: I don’t know what 

was pitched before, but for us, 
there’s a lot of excitement around 
our program right now. There’s a 
facility being built right now that 
will be as nice as anywhere in 
the country. There’s a brand-new 
coaching staff. Obviously, just 
being fairly new to the Big Ten 
right now, just new life, a new way 
of doing things in and around our 
team. Our players are very excited 
about stuff, so they’re conveying 
that to guys when they come visit.

Q: (This is your) first official 

head coaching job — what’s been 
the best part about it, and what’s 
been the biggest challenge of it?

DD: One and the same. The best 

part is the challenge of it. I like 
being busy and going and things 
happening. I think it’s good when 
you wake up in the morning 
and you have a list of things you 
feel you need to do and have a 
purpose. Those lists of things 
have gotten a little longer now 
that I’m a head coach — there’s a 
lot more to it — but I’ve enjoyed 

it. I have great people around me 
in terms of our coaching staff and 
administration. Our players have 
bought in really well.

Q: Last year, you had a highly 

successful season as defensive 
coordinator at Michigan. Can 
you reflect (on) the type of 
environment that’s there, the 
relationships you’ve made and 
what it will be like facing them 
this season?

DD: I just, whatever it was, an 

hour ago, saw Jourdan Lewis out 
there. Jourdan is a great kid, a 
great player. I’m very proud of all 
of his success and what he’s been 
able to accomplish. Whenever 
you go into games, go into battle 
with guys, you build relationships 
with your players and the coaches 
you’re with, so obviously there’s 
feelings there. At the same time, 
we’re now on the opposite sideline 
and they’re going to be doing 
everything they can to beat us and 

we’ll be doing everything we can 
to beat them. At the end of the day, 
our relationships will last a lot 
further than any one game, and 
that’s the cool thing about it. You 
get to look around and there are 
so many guys that I’ve been able 
to just be some small part of their 
career and their life, and when 
you hear back or 
talk to them or see 
them or whatever, 
it always brings a 
smile to your face.

Q: 
Can 
you 

reflect 
on 
your 

relationship with 
Under 
Armour 

and 
how 
that’s 

helping you with 
recruiting 
and 

building 
your 

program at Maryland?

DD: I’m not quite sure you 

can possibly measure how much 
that relationship helps us. I think 

it’s a (more) unique relationship 
than anywhere in the country, 
not just with the brand and the 
company, but with the people that 
are behind that company. The 
great part for me is the values and 
the things that are important to 
(Under Armour CEO) Kevin Plank 
and his company are really right 

in line with what’s 
important to our 
program. ... What 
they’ve 
done 
in 

their growth has 
been remarkable. 
When 
you 
look 

at 
what 
they’ve 

done in such a 
short amount of 
time, that’s pretty 
special. 
We’re 

trying to — in a 

different industry, a different 
setting — we’re trying to do the 
same thing. We’re here and we’re 
trying to build and go there and 

keep going up like they’re doing.”

TMD: So how do you like 

living in Maryland compared to 
Ann Arbor?

DD: I love it. My family loves it. 

I mean, we’ve been so blessed and 
fortunate. The places we’ve been 
able to live at and be associated 
with have all been great. Ann 
Arbor is a really neat place, a great 
college town. But where we live 
now, it’s pretty exciting. I think 
it’s one of the coolest parts of the 
country. There’s so much to do and 
see. My kids love it and my wife 
loves it. It’s been a really smooth, 
easy transition, which you can’t 
always say.

TMD: Were your kids afraid of 

that move?

DD: No, they were all in. 

They flew with me to the press 
conference, and once they got a 
pet turtle and met Testudo, they 
were Terp fans. Young kids, not 
much you have to sell them on.
