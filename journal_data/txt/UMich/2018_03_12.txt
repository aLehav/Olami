In a video released Sunday, 

white 
supremacist 
Richard 

Spencer announced a halt to 
his national college tour amid 
clashes between protesters and 
police at his scheduled speech 
at Michigan State University last 
Monday.

“At least for the foreseeable 

future, I don’t think it’s a good 
idea for me to host an event 
that’s wide open to the public, 
in which we name the date and 
the time,” Spencer said in his 
video. “Because if we do that in 
advance, Antifa are going to do 
their thing.”

Spencer’s 
legal 
team 

announced a delay in Spencer’s 
potential visit to the University 
until a future semester, stating 
they would prefer to hold an 
event in the summer to draw 
larger crowds.

MSU allowed Spencer to 

speak at the school following a 
lawsuit filed by Attorney Kyle 
Bristow. 
Bristow 
has 
since 

announced he will no longer aid 
Spencer’s team.

Stop Spencer at Michigan 

State University celebrated the 
decision to halt the college tour, 
attributing the news to the joint 
effort of those in the community 
and the Stop Spencer movement.

Members of the Lecturers’ 

Employee 
Organization 

gathered 
for 
a 
general 

membership meeting Friday 
on the University of Michigan-
Dearborn campus to discuss 
the 
next 
step 
in 
their 

campaign to secure a contract 
granting them higher wages 
and enhanced job security. 
Despite receiving what they 
called an “insulting” response 
to the union’s salary proposal 
last month, leaders remained 
optimistic, 
emphasizing 

the importance of involving 
both lecturers and allies in 
organizing efforts.

Representing 
nearly 

1,700 
non-tenure 
track 

faculty members across the 
University’s three campuses, 
LEO has been negotiatingsince 
October, asking for improved 
benefits, more full-time jobs 
and significant increases to 
minimum salaries.

Bargaining team manager 

and 
LEO 
Vice 
President 

Kirsten Herold, a lecturer at 
the School of Public Health, 
has been through five rounds 
of 
contract 
negotiations 

with LEO since the union’s 
inception in the early 2000s. 
She said she has maintained a 
positive outlook, citing public 
school 
teachers’ 
successful 

statewide walkout in West 
Virginia 
and 
grassroots 

enthusiasm.

“I 
really 
feel 
more 

optimistic 
this 
time 
than 

I otherwise have in terms 
of our shot at getting a real 
raise,” 
Herold 
said. 
“The 

University’s always been a 
little bit ahead of the curve on 
this front, and I really think 
this time we can do it. We just 
have to put everything into it. 
We have so much great staff, 
so many great allies and so 
many members involved. I’m 
telling people, we’re going to 

see a five-digit raise. If that’s 
not worth a few hours of your 
time, I don’t know what is.”

Under the union’s current 

contract, which expires April 
20, the minimum salary for a 
full-time lecturer is $34,500 
in Ann Arbor, $28,300 in 
Dearborn and $27,300 in Flint. 
LEO’s salary proposal would 
have raised the minimum to 
$60,000 in Ann Arbor and to 
$56,000 in Dearborn and Flint 
in 2018, increasing by $2,000 

at all three campuses in 2019 
and again in 2020.

The 
University 
instead 

offered a $1,000 increase to 
the starting salary in 2019, 
$750 in 2020 and $500 in 
2021. The deal also included 
a 1.5 percent annual raise for 
lecturers in Ann Arbor, but 
not those in Dearborn or Flint.

Former 
Secretary 
of 

Commerce Penny Pritzker, who 
worked under President Barack 
Obama and currently works 
as chairman of PSP Capital 
Partners 
and 
its 
affiliate, 

Pritzker Realty Group, spoke 
Friday in the Ford School of 
Public 
Policy’s 
Annenberg 

Auditorium. Dozens attended 
the event, titled “America’s 
Economic Future,” the first 
annual Vandenburg lecture. 
The event was held as a 
discussion between Pritzker 
and Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, 
who was a Business adjunct 
professor 
before 
serving 

as chief economist at the 
Department of Commerce.

The Vandenburg lectures 

are sponsored by the Meijer 
family and honors late Sen. 
Arthur Vandenberg, R-Mich, 
who 
encouraged 
bipartisan 

support 
for 
consequential 

foreign policy issues such as 
the 
Truman 
Doctrine, 
the 

Marshall Plan, NATO and the 
creation of the United Nations.

Heisman winner Charles Woodson 
to speak at spring commencement

EVAN AARON/Daily

The University of Michigan will have Charles Woodson as the speaker at the spring commencement ceremony this year.

Graduating seniors get to hear live speaker for second time in three years

The University of Michigan 

will have a speaker at its spring 
commencement ceremony this 
year, the University announced in 
a press release Monday, and that 
speaker is alum Charles Woodson.

Woodson, 
a 
student-athlete 

on the University’s football team 
from 1995 to 1997, received the 
Heisman Trophy in 1997. He is the 
only primarily defensive player to 
win the award to date. That same 
year, Woodson led the team to an 
undefeated season and national 
championship, then went on to 
an 18-season career in the N.F.L., 

playing for the Oakland Raiders 
and Green Bay Packers.

Central Student Government 

President Anushka Sarkar, an LSA 
senior, said the announcement 
excited and surprised her.

“I heard a lot of rumors about 

who the commencement speaker 
was going to be, and I think this 
is kind of coming out of left field,” 

Sarkar said. “They were pretty 
informal rumors — people kept 
saying Michelle Obama, Oprah. 
But I think they were pretty 
uninformed rumors.”

The Institute for the Humanities 

announced 
Thursday 
a 
new 

Summer Fellowship program for 
tenured/tenure-track faculty and 
lecturers II/III/IV. The program 
is eight weeks long with residence 
in the institute, and it will accept 
eight fellows this summer — four 
tenured/tenure-track faculty and 
four lecturers. 

The institute also provides a 

year-long 
fellowship; 
however, 

that is open only to tenure-
strain faculty and their graduate 
students. This summer program 
is meant to parallel the one held 
during the year but includes both 
lecturers and tenure-strain faculty. 
Peggy McCracken, director of the 
Institute for the Humanities, said 
including lecturers and tenured 
faculty together is unique program 
for the humanities.

“I’m really happy we’ve been 

able to put together this program 
that includes both tenure-strain 
faculty and lecturers,” McCracken 
said.

puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

stating 
while 
she 
had 

reservations 
after 
being 

offered 
the 
position 
of 

Obama’s 
campaign 
finance 

chair, her family encouraged 
her to accept the position. She 
would later serve on Obama’s 
economic recovery advisory 
board following his election 
as president, where Pritzker 
was responsible for advising 
the administration on ways to 
recover from the 2007-2008 
financial crisis. 

“Our banking system was on 

the verge of collapse, the auto 
industry was bankrupt and 
our country was really near 
collapse,” she said. 

Pritzker 
also 
served 
as 

an adviser on jobs, but later 
was confirmed as commerce 
secretary 
in 
June 
2013. 

Pritzker 
had 
no 
previous 

government experience.

“I had the honor of a lifetime 

to serve our country and to 
represent the United States of 
America both in our country 
and around the world,” she 
said.

Cromwick 
then 
shifted 

the 
conversation 
to 
the 

United States’ struggle with 
protectionism, asking Pritzker 
how the U.S. should manage 
global 
free 
trade 
so 
that 
 

it does not hurt domestic 
businesses, such as the steel 
and aluminum industries.

Pritzker 
responded 

business owners around the 
country were most concerned 
with 
obtaining 
global 
 

market access. She strongly 
supported 
the 
need 
for 

open 
international 
trade 

but 
thought 
businesses 

should 
protect 
vulnerable 

American 
industries 
by 

putting international pressure 
on countries that cheat the 

system.

Regarding 
steel, 
she 

asserted while some tariffs 
were necessary to implement, 
the U.S. should focus on 
international cooperation for 
protecting the American steel 
industry.

“We globally went to the 

OECD 
(Organisation 
for 

Economic Co-operation and 
Development) and other global 
organizations and said the 
world needs to come together 
and we need to fight whos 
over producing steel, which 
is China,” she said. “They are 
screwing up the steel market… 
but the way you address it is 
you have to have the world 
come together.”

President Donald Trump 

recently imposed tariffs of 
25 percent on imported steel 
and 10 percent on imported 
aluminum. The move was an 
effort to protect the American 
steel industry but has been 

criticized as an attack on 
free trade.

Pritzker 
also 

highlighted her efforts to 
promote free trade such as 
opening markets in China, 
elevating the commercial 
relationship 
with 
India 

and increasing trade with 
Africa. She then discussed 
the importance of the 
Trans-Pacific Partnership 
and 
the 
necessity 
for 

international cooperation 
on commerce.

“You can’t do much 

unilaterally 
… 
and 

commerce is a great way 
to 
develop 
multilateral 

relationships,” 
Pritzker 

said. “And that’s what 
TPP is about. It’s about 
creating 
rules 
… 
that 
 

bring 
your 
countries 

together.”

The TPP is a pact signed 

by the United States and 
11 
other 
countries 
in 

February 2016 to improve 
economic ties among the 
countries 
by 
slashing 

tariffs while increasing 
trade 
and 
promoting 

growth. Trump withdrew the 
United States from the pact on 
the first day of his presidency, 
believing that the deal hurt 
American industries.

During the Q&A portion of 

the lecture, a student asked 
Pritzker what she would do 
differently if she had the 
opportunity 
to 
return 
to 

her position as commerce 
secretary. Pritzker responded 
saying she regretted the TPP 
failed to be enacted.

“I had a leader of one of the 

TPP countries from Asia say 
to me about three weeks ago, 
‘You know, America is off the 
playing field in Asia,’” she 
said.

Pritzker 
concluded 
her 

thoughts by encouraging the 
students in the audience to 
volunteer on behalf of the 
country.

“If you get the opportunity 

to serve … do it,” she said. “And 
if you have the chance, even 
for a year or two to go and 
 

work in Washington, do it. 
Because we need the talent, 
we need the perspective, and 
particularly folks that come 
from these great research 
universities, you have a lot to 
offer.”

Andrew 
Breed, 
a 
U-M 

Dearborn 
alum, 
left 
the 

talk 
believing 
Pritzker’s 

approach to tariffs would be 
more effective than Trump’s 
approach.

“The tariffs that President 

Trump 
is 
talking 
about 

imposing on aluminum and 
steel … to me it’s really scary 
the way he’s going about 
 

trying to fix our economic 
situation,” he said. 

Business graduate student 

Parker 
Caldwell 
was 
also 

captivated 
by 
Pritzker’s 

story and her transition from 
business to government.

“I thought it was really 

interesting 
her 
backstory 

— getting involved in the 
 

Obama campaign and getting 
started in the government,” he 
said. “It was surprising by how 
organic it was.” 

PRITZKER
From Page 1A


If 
my 
experiences 
during 

college have taught me anything, 
it is that writing is a powerful 
means of expression. Somehow, 
even when I don’t know what to 
say, I always have something to 
write. Last semester, and this one, 
was really rough for me health-
wise. I grew quite frustrated 
and could not seem to express 
how I was feeling. So I wrote it 
down. And even though “One 

Second” is a poetic rendering of 
my struggles, it still does not do 
me justice. I am so much more 
than my disease, but I am also 
a writer, and it feels incredibly 
empowering to say that.

***
It’s amazing how long a second 

can feel.

At any time, in a matter of 

seconds, I could have a sickle cell 
attack.

As the crescent-shaped red 

blood cells coursing through my 
veins turn on me. They start to 
stick together and block the flow 

of blood in my body.

It’s 
surprising, 
the 
sheer 

amount of pain caused by the 
lack of oxygen to an organ.

It happened today. Honestly, it 

happens every day but the attacks 
vary in severity and usually, I can 
suppress them.

I’m not the type to complain, 

ask for pity or even tell people 
it’s happening, but this one was 
different — it only lasted for a 
second.

Just one second that felt like 

an eternity.

I was in class and all of a 

sudden felt I couldn’t breathe.

I resisted the urge to grasp my 

chest and fall back into my chair 
simply because I didn’t want to 
bring attention to myself.

Now I wonder if anyone would 

have even noticed. Would you?

And if you did, would you 

care? After all, there was nothing 
you could do.

It’s funny how stark the 

contrast is between my identities.

Most of the time I’m the only 

person like me in the room.

It’s like I have my own 

personal spotlight that follows 
me around.

I mean how many Nigerian-

American Muslim women with a 
chronic illness do you know?

One second, I’m the only Black 

person in a room and I feel as if 
all eyes are on me; the next, I’m 
gasping for air and though I’m 
surrounded by people, they don’t 
see my struggles.

I feel that my pain is invisible.
But I’ve always known this. 

You can’t tell, you can’t see my 
pain.

Yet, I wonder if you ever notice 

the subtle signs: The blank stare 
in my eyes, the quiet gasps I take, 
how I slur my words.

I know it’s not fair to expect 

that of you. I know it’s on me to 
teach you to look for these signs. 
I know it’s on me to let you know 
I’m not okay.

But sometimes I wish you 

could just sense something was 

off about me. Sometimes I wish 
you would just ask. Sometimes I 
wish I could take you with me, 
just to show you.

I don’t know how to describe 

what happens.

One second I’m fine and the 

next I feel like I might collapse.

One second passes and no one 

knows it ever even happened.

One second and I feel all alone.
Today it was my ankle, a part 

of our bodies most of us ignore.

Today 
it 
demanded 
my 

attention as it burst into pain.

Every second was agonizing as 

I waited for the pain to go away, 
but the seconds continued to pass 
and the pain stayed.

Then it would stop and just as 

I would go to take a sigh of relief, 
I would be struck by pain again.

Today I limped home because 

with every pang, I felt my ankle 
would give out and I would 
collapse.

Today I feared I wouldn’t be 

able to walk to class tomorrow,

And worse yet, today I worried 

the world would not wait for me 
to heal.

Today became tomorrow and 

it happened again.

One second I was fine and the 

next, in pain.

I gripped my pen so tight not 

even the jaws of life could save it.

After 
several 
everlasting 

seconds, 
it 
stopped 
and 
I 

remembered I was still in class.

I try to refocus my attention 

and next thing I know it’s back.

I hold my breath so as to not 

scream.

I don’t know what to do.
I ask God for help, but as the 

seconds pass, I find myself still 
helpless.

As I walked across campus 

from class to class, I held back 
tears,

As I was in so much pain but 

couldn’t explain,

As I begged for someone, 

anyone to see my pain.

I guess I wrote this hoping I 

could get you to see a glimpse of 
what I feel.

But as I write, I realize nothing 

I do can adequately show you.

My story, this feeling, is just 

one moment of your day.

But I live my whole life this 

way.

One second: Fighting my invisible pain

Forgotten histories of people of color

During this past Spring Break, 

several Michigan in Color editors 
were given the opportunity to 
travel to Washington, D.C. to 
discover forgotten histories in 
our nation’s capital. From visits to 
the National Museum of African 
American History and Culture 
and National Portrait Gallery to 
traversing 
the 
now-gentrified 

streets of Chinatown, we were 
reminded 
of 
how 
dominant 

narratives 
in 
the 
United 

States erase the history and 
contributions of people of color 
and the resistance necessary to 
create a more equitable society.

At all of the museums we 

visited — and especially the 
National Museum of African 
American History and Culture — 
we were impressed by the focus on 
activists we never learned about 
before coming to the University 
of Michigan. While Rosa Parks, 
Martin Luther King Jr. and 
Ruby Bridges all undoubtedly 
played monumental roles in the 
 

ongoing 
struggle 
for 
racial 

equality, 
it 
was 
interesting 

and refreshing to learn about 
those who risked it all so we 
could live out their dreams, 
despite receiving little national 
recognition. 
While 
the 

aforementioned key organizers 
had their space in the museum, the 
NMAAHC also had information 
about local organizers, students 
and brave families who had 
just as much to lose but were 
seemingly forgotten by history. 
While learning about larger-
than-life figures is important, it’s 
just as important to remember 

the Civil Rights Movement — like 
all other social movements — was 
powered by individuals who put 
themselves on the line for the 
chance of a better future.

We were also impressed by how 

the museums we visited framed 
our 
narratives. 
Oftentimes, 

people of color are portrayed as 
“sidekicks” or passive victims 
of greater societal events. The 
museums we visited told another 
story. In these spaces, POC were 
centered and portrayed as active 
agents in their own lives. For 
example, the National Museum of 
the American Indian emphasized 
Native Americans did not just 
passively agree to leave their 
land and walk what is now 
called the Trail of Tears — many 
fought against the colonizers and 
negotiated treaties that would’ve 
been 
mutually 
beneficial. 

Additionally, we learned about 
many 
different 
instances 

when Native Americans used 
the American court system to 
reclaim the land that was stolen 
from them in the past. These 
examples highlight that history 
is not just what is taught to us in 
school: POC have always been 
and always will be powerful 
agents of change. Because our 
narratives are very rarely front 
and center in history lessons, 
visiting these museums — which 
highlighted the narratives of 
POC — was especially impactful 
to see.

One of the only aspects of 

social movements that we felt 
wasn’t properly displayed was the 
 

role of coalition building and 
alliances. 
When 
we 
walked 

through 
the 
museums, 
we 

struggled to find evidence of 

the initiatives and impacts of 
coalitions 
and 
allies 
among 

different 
groups 
of 
POCs. 

However, just because the actions 
of allies were not highlighted, 
this does not remove their 
necessity nor their contributions. 
Coalitions unify individuals and 
groups interested in a common 
goal, enabling them to adequately 
share 
resources, 
information 

and 
numbers. 
The 
call 
for 

coalitions is becoming even more 
significant, and we can see this 
being carried out on our own 
campus. Student organizations, 
such as MuJew, the Black-
Asian Coalition and Leaders 
of Education, Advocacy, and 
Diversity are formal coalition-
building 
spaces 
focused 
on 

creating community and change 
across identity lines. Similarly, 
organizations like La Casa and 
the Muslim Students Association 
have made it a priority to 
facilitate cross-cultural sharing 
and to strengthen social change 
networks. Now more than ever, 
organizations 
are 
realizing 

the power that is made by 
establishing relationships across 
our communities.

Most importantly, the trip 

allowed 
for 
plentiful 
self-

reflection. As MiC continues 
to grow, we strive to remain 
a 
platform 
that 
accurately 

showcases 
the 
myriad 
of 

experiences of POC. To focus 
on race in isolation — without 
discussion 
of 
how 
gender, 

sexuality, 
ability 
status 
and 

other social identities affect our 
experience — is to also promote 
a dominant narrative and forget 
the histories of students on this 
campus.

My trip to the National Museum 

of African American History and 
Culture in Washington, D.C. was 
a poignant one. The visit started 
with an elevator ride down to the 
building’s lowest level. “1968” … 
“1954” … “1948” … “1865” — the 
years on the wall counted down 
as the elevator descended. I knew 
each year must’ve been picked for 
a significant event that occurred 
— the passage of the Civil Rights 
Act in 1968 or the end of the Civil 
War in 1865 — but for many of the 
years (especially the older ones), I 
didn’t know what specifically was 
being referenced. “1808”… “1776” 
… “1565.” Finally, the elevator 
stopped and the door opened. The 
wall read “1400”.

According 
to 
my 
most 

conservative estimates, 1400 is a 
good two centuries before any of 
my past American history courses 
began. As a result, I didn’t know 
exactly what I’d encounter, but I 
predicted it wouldn’t be positive. 
My hunch was correct.

Immediately, I was greeted 

with information and beautiful 
artifacts 
from 
pre-Columbian 

Africa, but it didn’t take long 
before I was shown the horrors 
of the Middle Passage and slave-
life in Colonial America. The 
next section focused on slave-
life in the Antebellum South 
(which was marked by the same 

savage treatment received by the 
slaves who came before) and life 
in the Jim Crow South. Finally, 
as I worked my way back up to 
the top of the museum, I walked 
through the exhibit about modern 
Black life in America. As “The 
Message” by Grandmaster Flash 
and the Furious Five played in the 
background — a song my parents 
frequently 
played 
during 
my 

childhood — I read about the crack 
epidemic, the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency’s botched 
response to Hurricane Katrina 

and education inequalities.

There was no happy ending. 

As a Black American, that wasn’t 
comforting — but it also wasn’t 
surprising. I went in knowing 
there’s still much work left to be 
done, and I didn’t leave any more 
optimistic for the future.

As I exited the exhibits, I 

entered 
the 
“Contemplative 

Court.” Earlier in the morning, 
the guide on the elevator told 
us about this room. In fact, she 

recommended 
spending 
some 

time there to reflect on what 
we were about to see and learn. 
In the center of the room sat a 
large, circular pool. Water rained 
down around the perimeter, and 
the drops lit up as they hit the 
water below. To me — and to 
many people, as I learned after 
conducting more research once 
I returned home — those drops 
symbolized the tears of those who 
came before me. The tears were 
from the people who suffered 
during the Middle Passage, the 
slave families separated on the 
auction block and the Black 
students who were denied an 
equal shot at education. However, 
as their tears hit the water, the 
light symbolized the progress 
made possible by their sacrifices — 
they didn’t suffer in vain.

As I looked up from the 

fountain, ready to leave the room, 
the quote on the wall caught my 
eye. Across from me, the wall read, 
“A change is gonna come” — a line 
from the chorus of Sam Cooke’s 
1964 song with the same name. 
With the negative mood left by 
the museum, I was particularly 
affected, almost relieved, by that 
line. While the exhibits offered 
little solace, the “Contemplative 
Court” and Sam Cooke’s quote 
gave me optimism for the future. 
While I can’t go back to undo the 
suffering of the past, I can fight for 
a more just future — the only way 
to truly ensure that those tears 
weren’t cried in vain.

The responsibility of the endowment

The FBI Man

MATTHEW FRIEND | COLUMN

HANK MINOR | COLUMN

T 

he unusually persistent 
national focus on gun 
control has given rise 

to online satire of proposals — 
particularly in Florida — to arm 
teachers as a countermeasure 
for mass shootings. Twitter, 
as usual, delivered the most 
popular examples — all of which 
centered around the idea of how 
comical it would be for less-than-
threatening high school teachers 
to carry handguns. 

This reaction doesn’t seem 

to be unique to the gun control 
discussion, though; we have a 
habit online of satirizing terrible 
things as a way of dealing with 
them. Trump becomes Drumpf, 
and his antics are exaggerated on 
“Saturday Night Live” every, well, 
Saturday night.

The “FBI man” — a fictional 

government 
agent 
watching 

you 
through 
your 
webcam, 

commenting on your life — became 
a joke earlier in the year, too, with 
some tweets on the topic reaching 
100,000 or more retweets.

The worrying thing here is that 

all of these things are real — either 
as legislation, executive policy 
or political reality: The National 
Security Agency can watch you 
through your webcam; Floridan 
politicians are pushing a measure 
appropriating 
funds 
to 
arm 

teachers; and our president does 
actually say ridiculous, incoherent 
things on a daily basis.

I don’t think this is some 

coordinated effort to normalize 
shocking 
state 
action. 
I 
do, 

however, think that it’ll become 
increasingly damaging to our 
political environment to treat 
everything as an absurd joke. It’s a 
way of coping — and we certainly 
need ways of doing that — but it 
numbs us to the legitimate flaws of 
our government.

We can only joke about a 

guardian-angel-esque “FBI man” 
because Edward Snowden is in 
exile in Russia after leaking a 
cache of government documents, 
and because Chelsea Manning 
was tortured for doing the same 
only three years prior. Somewhat 
similarly, 
President 
Donald 

Trump’s strange way of speaking 
only matters because half of 
the electorate voted him into 
office. We’ve found this way of 
acclimating to dramatic change 
in our status quo, but I worry it 
comes at the cost of our ability to be 
genuinely outraged.

Sure, there’s the good side 

of this tendency — the way the 
Stoneman Douglas teens have 
managed to hold our attention on 
gun control is a fantastic example 
— but it seems like the majority of 
our outrage has come to resemble 
the two-minute hate from “1984.” 
Liberal college students and the 
right wing alike fly into a fury for 
the weekend. Rick Gates pleads 
guilty to financial fraud and lying 
to investigators, and the left wing 
speculates on exactly when Trump 
will be put in handcuffs.

It’s not easy to find a 

solution, though. Satire is an 
arguably important part of 
political discourse; asking that 
we stop making light of political 
events is impractical and could 
take something away from the 
public dialogue — still, the risks 
remain. We could ask people to 
know more about their political 
system, but assuming everyone 
has the time to understand 
every issue that will be parodied 
is 
naïve. 
Satirical 
political 

content is widespread, because 
people don’t have the time to 
study the news in meticulous 
detail and want to consume it in 
a different medium.

Asking 
comedians 
and 

partisans to censor their content 
for the health of the system is 
borderline absurd, and legal 
regulation — if it was even 
possible — would be a solution 
worse than the problem it tries 
to solve.

What’s most likely to happen 

— and what happens most 
often now — is that partisan 
interests will conduct clarifying 
messaging out of self-interest. 
Social movements have to be 
grown 
and 
encouraged 
by 

organizers, and parties filter 
their various factions through 
the primary process. Perhaps 
one of the responsibilities of 
evolving media is to clarify pop 
culture politics.

That said, I think it’s most 

likely 
nothing 
will 
happen, 

and there will be no significant 
reaction. Instinctual desire for 
social gratification will push 
people toward participation, and 
we will simply have to grapple 
with the consequences of a public 
discourse that treats everything 
as a joke by default.

I don’t want to emulate Fox 

News and come off as if I’m 
just complaining about the way 
Americans can’t name every 
state capitol or recite the Pledge 
of Allegiance. Civic engagement 
is complicated, and lots of 
people live lives that don’t give 
them the luxury of sustained 
investment in daily political 
drama. That said, overcoming 
our growing tendency to cope 
with 
political 
problems 
by 

making them into comedy is 
going to be a major problem of 
future and current activists.

D

uring their respective 
seasons, I watch both 
“The Bachelor” and “The 

Bachelorette.” I’m pretty invested 
in the franchise. I love the drama, 
the mindlessness and the excuse 
to hang out with my friends, snack 
and procrastinate on a weeknight.

Last week brought us the finale 

of this season of “The Bachelor.” 
If you don’t know the premise 
of the show, I’ll give you a quick 
rundown. 
The 
season 
starts 

with 29 women competing for a 
(supposedly) eligible bachelor’s 
attention. Each week, beginning 
with the very first episode, some 
women are eliminated while other 
women get roses and security until 
the next week. They travel to a few 
exotic locales all the while going on 
single and group dates and trying 
to deal with the fact they’re living 
with all of the other girls their love 
interest is dating. The show has 
its flaws, but I’m going to set them 
aside for this column to look at an 
unexpected positive.

The 
show, 
of 
course, 

focuses on the relationships 
between the individual women 
and the bachelor. It rarely 
shows the relationships among 
the women, unless the scene 
in some way contributes to 
some narrative of discontent. 
The women as we see them 
are either indifferent toward 
each other or actively negative. 
The network likes to show the 
audience instances of women 
mocking, doubting or trying to 
undermine others. The editing 
of the show often portrays the 
women in fierce competition; 
there are tears, gossip and 
aggressive 
confrontations. 

There is always a villain who 
can be picked out right away 
by experienced viewers, and a 
significant portion of the show 
is always spent on encounters 
between the “bad guy” and 
the rest of the women. When 
she is finally sent home, often 
in a way that is designed to 
maximize her embarrassment, 
there is a sense of triumph.

The producers work for 

drama on “The Bachelorette” 
too, when the house is instead 
filled 
with 
men. 
However, 

the tone the drama takes is 
different. 
The 
anticipatory 

scenes suggest violent, physical 
altercations. The outcome of a 
disagreement is fists instead 
of tears. On both shows, you’ll 
see pettiness. You’ll see hurt 
feelings, gossip and contestants 
seizing 
opportunities 
to 

convince the love interest that 
someone else is there for the 
wrong reasons. Despite the 
similarity in behavior, it seems 
the way contestants are treated 
often suggests there are far 
more instances of animosity 
and personal attacks among 
the women.

There’s 
an 
underrated 

highlight that comes out of 
the show, and it’s a surprising 
one. You have to search outside 
the two-hour episodes to find 
it because the network won’t 
show you. If you turn to the 
social media accounts of the 
contestants on the show, you’ll 
find that strong friendships 
form over the course of their 
competition. You’ll find that, 
sure, not everyone was best 
friends — that never happens 
when you stick 20 strangers in 
a house together. But all of them 
emerge with bonds to the other 
women, those who they were 
supposed to view as an obstacle 
between them and their happy 
ending. The network edits in 
such a way that they show the 
most contention and drama 
possible — they do this because 
the audience asks for it.

The world outside the show 

reveals the women care deeply 
about each other. They travel 
together beyond the show, they 
encourage 
each 
other, 
they 

support each other. In this 
season’s heartbreaking finale, 
the bachelor, Arie, proposed 
to one woman, Becca, before 
calling it off for a second chance 
with the “runner-up,” Lauren. 

The women banded together 
to show support for both Becca 
and Lauren and call out Arie’s 
immature 
and 
disrespectful 

behavior. It would have been 
easy in that moment to take 
sides and place blame on one 
of the women, but they didn’t. 
They reminded the nation of 
viewers Lauren wasn’t to blame 
for Becca’s heartache, and Becca 
herself shared her well wishes 
for the couple.

It’s 
important 
to 
me 

because I, and many others, 
grew up with the narrative 
that women always had to be 
in competition. In movies, in 
TV shows, in whatever media, 
we so frequently see female 
characters tearing down other 
women. We see “frenemies” 
and mean girls. It’s refreshing 
to see the way that real women 
(even if they’re in an unrealistic 
situation) behave when they’re 
not directed by a writing team 
who suggests drama is the 
only 
highlight 
of 
women’s 

relationships. Here, in maybe 
the unlikeliest of circumstances, 
where the situation could excuse 
competition and high emotion, 
strong 
and 
lasting 
female 

friendships formed.

The friendships don’t exactly 

redeem the show. Seeing the 
relationships that come out of 
it doesn’t make me feel better 
about the way the shows rely on 
manipulation and necessitate 
heartbreak. But they do make 
me hopeful, in a way. On one 
side, you see the women as the 
network wants you to see them: 
petty, dramatic, emotional and 
hoping to get a proposal at the 
end of the show, no matter the 
cost. But on the other side, you 
see women who wanted an 
adventure, who really did sign 
up to find love and who found 
it, even if it wasn’t where they 
expected.

A bright spot on the Bachelor

O

ver the past couple of 
months, a series of articles 
published by the Detroit 

Free Press has exposed several 
controversial practices regarding 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan’s 

endowment and its investment/
distribution. Some of the practices 
in 
question 
include 
potential 

conflicts of interest arising from 
the investment of endowment 
funds in large University donors, 
the decision-making process of 
how much of the endowment is 
annually allotted to the University 
and the lack of investment in 
businesses and funds located in the 
state of Michigan.

To address these issues and 

determine the validity of these 
concerns, I think it is important to 
better understand the purpose of 
the University’s endowment. Does 
the endowment, an $11 billion fund 
meant to support the University 
and its initiatives, exist solely 
for the purpose of maximizing 
financial returns, or does it have an 
additional responsibility?

According to materials provided 

by the University, the endowment’s 
mission is to create “a guaranteed, 
never-ending source of income 
to support student scholarships, 
professorships, innovative programs, 
learning opportunities and life-
saving research.” In other words, 
it exists to earn as much money as 
possible in the long-run, and to pump 
a portion of the earnings back into 
the school. I found no mention of 
any political or ethical guidelines for 
where the funds are invested or of 
any specific types of industries they 
choose to support. In fact, when the 
Central Student Government passed 
a resolution urging the University to 
consider divesting from groups that 
are associated with anti-Palestinian 
interests, the University responded 
by saying they “strongly oppose 
any action involving the boycott, 
divestment or sanction of Israel 
… (the University of Michigan) 
remain(s) 
committed 
to 
the 

University’s longstanding policy to 
shield the endowment from political 
pressures,” further reiterating their 
non-partisan 
stance 
regarding 

investment decisions.

Perhaps this singular focus on 

financial returns is justified, as the 
University’s finances are heavily 
dependent 
on 
the 
endowment 

and its performance. According 
to financial statements provided 
by the University, the endowment 
contributed over $300 million to all 
U-M campuses this past year, about 
26 percent of all University revenue. 
The endowment provides almost 
as much money to the University’s 
budget as is contributed by the state 
of Michigan. So yes, I do agree with 
the University’s stance that the 

endowment’s primary purpose is 
to continue to grow at high levels, 
at least enough to support critical 
practices such as providing financial 
aid, paying competitive salaries 
to attract the best faculty and 
maintaining our beautiful campus.

I feel it would be ignorant, 

though, to end the conversation 
here and ignore the endowment’s 
secondary responsibilities. The 
University of Michigan is a public 
university with the purpose of 
educating the future leaders of 
Michigan and preparing the state 
for future success. From firsthand 
experience, 
I 
can 
state 
the 

University consistently preaches 
positive values and behaviors to 
the student body, including direct 
statements by University President 
Mark Schlissel denouncing acts 
of hate and violence that occur on 
campus and beyond.

Money equals power and 

influence — a perhaps unfortunate 
but important truth. The University 
has nearly $11 billion worth of 
power and influence at its disposal 
via the endowment. Economic 
boycotts have the potential to be 
successful tools to enact change, 
as demonstrated by the successful 
divestment 
movement 
against 

apartheid-era South Africa in the 
1980s. Positive change doesn’t just 
come from withholding capital 
from harmful movements, as 
investing money in struggling or 
capital-scarce communities has the 
potential to create good as well. 

A 
close-to-home 
example 

of how investments can benefit 
communities 
can 
be 
seen 

through Shinola, a luxury goods 
retailer based out of Detroit. 
Shinola performs the bulk of its 
manufacturing 
and 
operations 

locally, rather than pursuing less-
expensive alternatives outside of 
Detroit. This deliberate investment 
in the city of Detroit created 
hundreds of jobs during one of the 
most economically-trying times in 
the city’s history.

Admittedly, my experience and 

knowledge of investing are much less 
than that of the individuals in charge 
of our University’s endowment, and 
I don’t claim to possess a detailed 
plan about how to create the most 
good with the endowment funds. 
With this said, I do believe there 
are plenty of opportunities for the 
University to pursue its primary 
goal of maximizing financial returns 
while making investment decisions 
that could benefit students, the state 
of Michigan and society as a whole.

One potential idea of how the 

endowment could achieve this is 
investing in socially responsible 
funds, which make the conscious 
decision to not invest in companies 
or ventures that they feel are 

harmful to the world. And yes, 
despite popular opinion, data 
exists demonstrating that socially 
responsible funds can in fact 
perform just as well as their “sinful” 
counterparts. With the continually 
growing concern surrounding gun 
control and school shootings, the 
University could at the very least 
consider ways to leverage their 
investing power to put pressure 
on firms related to firearms 
manufacturing and retail.

Creating a mandate requiring a 

certain portion of the endowment, 
no matter how nominal, to be 
invested in projects that create 
growth and employment in the 
state of Michigan is another 
option. There are many legitimate 
financial reasons for why the 
University 
invests 
its 
money 

globally, but I cannot imagine 
the state of Michigan lacks so 
greatly in economic activity that 
the endowment cannot find more 
investment 
opportunities 
to 

support the state while keeping 
their investment goals intact. It 
may take more effort, but I believe 
the duty the University has more 
than justifies this extra time.

Perhaps 
even 
exploring 

the idea of using endowment 
dollars to provide subsidized, 
low-interest loans for students 
as 
an 
avenue 
for 
making 

education 
more 
affordable 

while growing the endowment 
(albeit at a slightly lower rate) 
is a possibility the University 
could consider.

The endowment’s continued 

growth is crucial to the future 
success and stability of our 
University. Those in charge of 
the endowment hold a great 
responsibility, making decisions 
that 
will 
affect 
students, 

alumni, employees of the school 
and many other stakeholders 
for years to come. I believe the 
responsibility of the endowment 
extends beyond purely financial 
returns though. It is certainly 
up for debate how much those 
individuals in charge of the 
endowment can support these 
initiatives while achieving their 
primary objective of making 
money for the University, but it 
is a topic that requires further 
discussion. But all else equal, 
if we have the option to invest 
our money in ventures or funds 
that might make our state and 
the world better off, it is the 
responsibility of those in charge 
to make that happen, and for 
the University to put its money 
where its mouth is.

ANSWER TO PREVIOUS PUZZLE:

RELEASE DATE– Monday, March 12, 2018

Los Angeles Times Daily Crossword Puzzle

Edited by Rich Norris and Joyce Nichols Lewis

Mick Jagger called her his 
“ideal woman.” Carly Simon 
always “tried to dress like her.” 
Alexa Chung and Rei Kawakubo 
cite her as inspirations. Françoise 
Hardy’s long and prolific career 
has transcended the French 
music world, transforming her 
into a global icon of music and 
fashion. Her breezy ode to youth 
“Le temps de l’amour” is featured 
in “Moonrise Kingdom,” and for 
the most part, represents what 
most people — including me at 
one point — recognize from her 
vast discography. Yet her first 
departure from her trademark 
catchy, but disposable, style of 
pop remains my favorite and her 
musical peak.
The 
increased 
musical 
maturity in Hardy’s 1971 album 
La question is a result of her 
collaboration with a Brazilian 
guitarist named Tuca. While 
it is not exactly a bossa nova 
album per se, the somewhat 
subdued and melancholic nature 
of the Brazilian genre permeates 
the album. Tuca’s orchestral 
compositions in songs like “La 
question” and “Mer” avoid being 
overtly sappy and sentimental, 
and 
subtly 
complement 
the 
sparse, minimalist instrumental 
arrangements.
Compared with her poppier 
previous output, the melodies on 

La question are noticeably richer 
and more complex. While Hardy 
does not showcase much vocal 
range, her incredibly soothing, 
rather restrained voice is given 
a wider variety of tones and 

textures to explore. At its core, 
much of the album deals with 
the idea of longing, and that idea 
is never more apparent than 
when Hardy simply extends a 
word or phrase, such as “viens” 
(“Come”) or “mer” (“Sea”) in her 
trademark, breathy manner.
Hardy’s lyrics on La question 
range from sensual to wistful, 

but never overwrought. The title 
track is a beautiful meditation 
on what could be interpreted as 
a dying relationship, with Hardy 
singing: “Je ne sais pas pourquoi 
je reste dans une mer où je me 
noie” (“I don’t know why I’m 
staying in a sea which I’ll drown 
in”), but also confessing to her 
lover: “Tu es ma question sans 
réponse, mon cri muet et mon 
silence” (“You are my question 
without an answer, my mute cry 
and my silence”).
On “Mer,” another lyrical 
standout, Hardy paints a poetic 
picture of the sea, ultimately 
saying: “Mon amour est si lourd 
à porter, je voudrais doucement 
me coucher dans le mer” (“My 
love is too heavy to bear, I 
want to softly sleep in the sea”). 
However, she can be equally 
frank as poetic, as evident on 
the following track, “Oui je 
dis adieu,” in which she tells a 
former lover: “Avec toi la vie est 
pleine de saudades tout le temps, 
ça ne me dit plus rien, cette perte 
de mon temps” (“With you life is 
full of saudade, this waste of time 
means nothing to me anymore”), 
using 
the 
Portuguese 
word 
“saudade.”
On La question, Hardy’s voice 
lives up to its full potential with 
Tuca’s 
delicate 
yet 
emotive 
arrangements, creating a unique 
melancholic atmosphere. Four 
decades after its release, it 
remains a perfect soundtrack to 
a reflective rainy day.

and complex ‘La question’

FILM NOTEBOOK

Remember the name Michael 
Stuhlbarg. Since starring as Larry 
Gopnik in the Coen brothers’ 
2009 Best Picture nominee, “A 
Serious Man,” Stuhlbarg has 
made more of a face than a name 
for himself. He is the guy that 
people can point to as looking 
vaguely familiar, but that’s the 
extent of it. Since starring as an 
intellectual, neurotic Jew in the 
Coen brothers’ drama, Stuhlbarg 
has been type-cast as a character 
actor with a knack for filling the 
archetype of the intellectual, 
neurotic Jew. He is great actor 
who exemplifies what my high 
school theatre teacher constantly 
reminded me: There are no small 
roles, only small actors. Stuhlbarg 
certainly proves that no role is 
too small. He moved viewers 
(including 
Frank 
Ocean) 
as 
Professor Perlman in the Oscar-
winning film “Call Me by Your 
Name,” with his emotional and 
expertly delivered monologue. 
In a way, Michael Stuhlbarg is to 
Oscar-bait movies as Judy Greer 
(“13 Going on 30”) is to rom-
coms: Essential, familiar and 
under-utilized. 
Yet, in the nine short years 
since Stuhlbarg has entered 
Hollywood’s pearly white gates, 
he has been in seven Best Picture 
nominees. I mean, wow. The 
actor is the second person to 

have appeared in three Best 
Picture nominees of the same 
year. The first to do so was John 
C. Reilly (“Kong: Skull Island”) 
who appeared in three out 
of the five 2003 Best Picture 
nominees: 
“Chicago,” 
“Gangs 
of New York” and “The Hours” 
(all three were produced by 
Harvey Weinstein’s Miramax). 
Reilly was nominated for his 
supporting role in “Chicago,” 
which won Best Picture in 2003. 
Stuhlbarg appeared in 2018’s 
Best Picture winner, “The Shape 
of Water,” as a Soviet spy, brought 
audiences to tears in “Call Me by 
Your Name” and made a minor 
but crucial appearance in “The 
Post” as New York Times editor 
Abe Rosenthal. 
However, Stuhlbarg is not 
the only actor this year to make 
appearances in several Oscar-
nominated films. His on-screen 
son, Timothée Chalamet, starred 
in two Best Picture nominees 
(“Lady Bird” and “Call Me by Your 
Name”), putting his beautiful face 
on the map. Chalamet’s co-star 
in “Lady Bird,” Lucas Hedges, 
played Frances McDormand’s 
son 
in 
“Three 
Billboards 
Outside 
Ebbing, 
Missouri.” 
Hedges’s fellow ginger in “Three 
Billboards,” Red, played by Caleb 
Landry Jones, also starred in 
multiple nominated films. Before 
he got the shit kicked out of him 
in Best Picture nominee “Three 
Billboards” by Sam Rockwell, 
he got the shit kicked out him 

in Best Picture nominee “Get 
Out” by Daniel Kaluuya (not 
to mention a brief appearance 
alongside Willem Defoe in the 
colossal Oscar snub, “The Florida 
Project”). 
Bradley 
Whitford 
and Tracy Letts both appeared 
in “The Post” in addition to 
their 
fatherly 
performances 
in “Get Out” and “Lady Bird,” 
respectively. Alison Brie and 
Bob Odenkirk also had starring 
roles in “The Post,” in addition 
to their minor roles in Best 
Adapted 
Screenplay 
nominee 
“The Disaster Artist.” Lily James 
starred in Best Picture nominee 
“Darkest Hour,” as well as the 
fast-paced, action-packed Edgar 
Wright film “Baby Driver,” which 
was nominated for Best Editing, 
Best Sound Mixing and Best 
Sound Editing. 
Hollywood is not afraid to 
reduce, reuse and recycle actors 
when it comes to awards season. 
Perhaps the good actors in 
Hollywood today are too few 
to spread the wealth or maybe 
these guys just have really good 
agents. 
Regardless, 
Michael 
Stuhlbarg is but one Kevin Bacon 
in the massive web of degrees of 
separation that is Hollywood. 
Therefore, the art of the cameo 
is no longer reserved for the 
Hitchcock’s and the Stan Lee’s 
of the world, actors can cameo 
as well. So, keep your eyes peeled 
for the new star of cinema, the 
supporting, supporting role: the 
cameo.

BOOK REVIEW

Following the indie success 
of her first novel, “The Atomic 
Weight of Love,” Elizabeth 
Church returns with “All the 
Beautiful Girls,” a coming-of-
age story about the resilience 
of a 1960s Las Vegas showgirl. 
There’s a lot to unpack here.
After surviving a car crash 
that kills her parents and sister, 

Lily Decker moves in with her 
aunt and uncle. At just eight-
years-old, her life is molded 
by this tragedy, this accident. 
She befriends “the Aviator,” 
the man who killed her family. 
He’s a good man who made a 
mistake, and he’s pretty much 
the only person on her team, 
helping her to navigate what 
I can only categorize as The 
Worst Childhood Ever.
She grows up with her heart 
set on leaving her hometown 
the second she can, and that’s 
exactly what she does. She 
gives herself a new name, 
transforming into Ruby Wilde 
over the course of a bus ride to 
Sin City. She’s on her way to be 
a troupe dancer, and she ends 
up working as a showgirl. After 
spending her childhood pining 
for a version of the American 
dream, she spends her adult 
career tripping over the many 
disillusions of it.
Most 
of 
Ruby’s 
story 
reads like this — a series of 
missteps on a road paved with 

imperfections. I had trouble 
holding her close to my heart, 
and I think it’s because she’s 
too beautiful. She’s a manic-
pixie-dream showgirl, and in 
all of her faults and failures, 
she’s flawless. Church created 
a character that doesn’t just 
inhabit the traits she was given 
— she drips with them. Ruby 
is 
soaked 
in 
ephemerality, 
constantly lusted after, and it 
makes it hard to place her in 
our own world. Church writes 
her heroine to be graceful in a 
blustering town, resilient in a 
marred home, stunning as she 
goes through puberty. She isn’t 
real.
That’s 
my 
biggest 
beef 
with the book: It’s not real. 
Ruby gets breaks when she 
needs them, not a moment too 
soon or a beat too late. She 
befriends a man on her ride 
to Vegas who, if he existed in 
any other story (and especially 
our own world), would have 
been creepy with her. But 
instead of predatory advances 
and suggestive conversations, 
Ruby gets an immediate safety 
net upon her arrival in the city. 
Church builds her life to be 
hard, but not too hard. She pads 
it, making it just horrifying 
enough for us to sympathize 
with Ruby but embellished 
enough for us to realize that we 
could never be Ruby.
The novel’s dialogue is no 
different. 
It’s 
unnaturally 
eloquent and blasphemously 
fluid. The conclusions Ruby 
comes to and her delivery of 
them are far too astute and 
smooth to ever emerge from 
an actual person. When she 
finally 
arises 
healed 
from 
a 
cruel 
relationship 
with 
photographer and all-around 
lowlife 
Javier, 
she 
pours 
herself out to the Aviator. 
She gives him everything — 

the nights with her uncle, 
the days with her aunt, the 
evenings with Javier — only 
to end by saying, “That’s what 
I’ve learned lately. Javier. My 
accident. Everything — it’s just 
life.”
Yeah, it’s life, but people 
don’t speak like this. Even in 
her pain and her mistakes, 
she 
still 
comes 
across 
as 
impeccable, 
figuring 
out 
life at an unrealistically fast 
pace. Ruby is so gorgeous and 

so striking that it’s hard to 
read her as anything short of 
heartbreaking — a version of 
a character who only slightly 
resembles pieces of the people 
we strive to be.
And maybe the point is 
supposed to live somewhere 
along these lines, somewhere 
in the moments where Ruby 
is so damaged by the world 
around her and punished for 
her porcelain prowess that 
she can’t help but shine in her 
provocative 
resilience. 
And 
maybe I’m just jealous. I have 
a hunch, though, that Ruby’s 
perfection is more a product of 
her maker than a consequence 
of her misfortunes. That being 
said, “All the Beautiful Girls” 
was an entertaining read. It 
took me to an era I’ve always 
wanted to see in a city I never 
dreamed of seeing it in. Church 
wrote a big world for a girl who 
was always made to feel small, 
and she gave her growing 
room. It was fun — albeit a 
little too beautiful.

That’s my biggest 
beef with the 
book: It’s not real 

WIKIMEDIA COMMONS


The first Ed Sheeran song I 
ever heard was “Lego House,” 
way back in 2012 at the peak of 
the piece’s radio fame. Before 
high school, I wasn’t really 
one for music; I listened to the 
radio, sure, but because I didn’t 
have an iPod — I didn’t have 
the easy portability that most 
kids my age did. In regards to 
music, I was a late bloomer.
Sheeran’s voice enthralled 
me. It was smoother than the 
pop music I was used to hearing 
on 98.7 (the local hits station) 
and far easier on the ears than 
the rap that I absolutely hated. 
Something about the way he 
drew out the word “for” right 
before the chorus ramped up 
made my heart swell. How 
would I show off my newfound 
love? 
A 
Facebook 
like, 
of 
course. I clicked the button, 
excited to show my love to the 
world.
The next day, one of my 
friends confronted me.
“Since when do you listen to 
Ed Sheeran?” she asked, in a 
somewhat accusatory tone.
“ ... Yesterday?” I responded, 
confused.
“Why did you like him on 
Facebook? You can’t do that if 
you’ve only heard two of his 
songs,” she continued, leaving 
abruptly once she had said her 
due.
Since then, I’ve been more 
and more tentative about who 

I share my music tastes with 
and why. It sounds stupid, of 
course, the age old “you’re not a 
real fan unless you’ve listened 
to their entire discography 69 
times.” Even then, your fan-
ship is only valid if you can 
stand up to impromptu quizzes 
from any and all members of 
the artist’s legion of fellow 
fanatics. Why can’t music just 
be music? Why can’t Swifties 
just listen to good ol’ Taylor 
in peace? Why can’t I like Ed 
Sheeran on Facebook after only 
listening to two of his songs?

Music is never just music. 
That’s 
the 
problem. 
To 
have music, you must have 
musicians, and in this day and 
age, musicians are celebrities — 
and celebrities are politicians, 
entrepreneurs, 
chefs 
and 
models. Telling a musician to 
“stay in their lane” is futile 
because musicians rarely only 
have one lane — not to mention 
the concept itself is usually 
a bad humored attempt to 
shut someone up. In regards 
to the general scale of fame 
and social leverage, musicians 

are among the most powerful 
sociocultural figures in the 
modern era. Each band and solo 
artist influences a tremendous 
audience of listeners, some of 
whom are young and especially 
impressionable. If an artist 
draws attention to a specific 
political movement, people are 
going to take notice. If an artist 
doesn’t, people will notice that, 
too.
With social media’s prolific 
presence, 
it 
has 
become 
easier than ever for artists 
to communicate with their 
fans. Eat something tasty? 
Tweet about it. Fly out to LA? 
Instagram it. Not mentioning 
something as significant as 
politics has to be an intentional 
oversight, and even staying 
silent in such a politically-
charged 
environment 
is 
a 
statement rather than a neutral 
stance.
To a certain degree, my 
friend had a point. Making up 
my mind about an artist after 
only hearing two of his songs 
was rather short-sighted. Could 
I form a conclusive impression 
of Ed Sheeran only from his 
voice? Probably not. Maybe 
the irritating sphere of music 
snobs has a point. Whether you 
purchase an artist’s music or 
you listen to them via a music 
streaming 
service, 
you’re 
supporting them. As long as we 
stay aware of what that support 
entails, there’s no need to be 
a music snob — love for music 
isn’t something that can be 
quantified in minutes. 

Ed Sheeran & music snobs

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

ATLANTIC RECORDS

It’s a question that circulates 
through 
middle 
school 
sleepovers, long car rides and 
uncomfortable dinner parties: 
If you knew you are going to 
die tomorrow, what would you 
do today? For most people, 
this question is just a fun party 
game, something to think about 
that you will never really have 
to face. But for others, like Stella 
Abbott (Lucy Hale, “Pretty 
Little Liars”), who have their 
death (supposedly) set in stone, 
this question drives the daily 
choices that they make, for 
better or for worse.
In the case of Stella in “Life 
Sentence,” it’s definitely for 

worse. After eight years of 
battling terminal cancer and 
living her life as if each day 
was her last, Stella is cured of 
her disease and must face the 
reality of a world that is much 
harsher than she once believed. 
As soon as Stella tells friends 
and family that she is healthy, 
her parents split up, her brother 
(Jayson Blair, “Unforgettable”) 
turns out to be a low-life who 
impregnates married women 
and 
her 
beautiful 
British 
husband (Elliot Knight, “Once 
Upon A Time”) tells her that he 
has only been pretending to love 
all of the same things she does 
because he didn’t think she’d be 
around long enough to figure 
out otherwise.

It’s certainly a lot to handle 
at once, yet none of these 
represent a main conflict in the 
show. In fact, “Life Sentence” 
is pretty much void of conflict 
all together. How can anything 
seem 
so 
significant 
and 
overwhelming to Stella after 
she literally beats cancer? This 
girl stared certain death in the 
face for eight years and came 
out alive on the other side, but 
somehow we are supposed to 
believe that finding out that her 
husband’s favorite movie isn’t 
“Love Actually” is somehow 
going to push her over the edge.
And 
it’s 
this 
equating 
everyday inconveniences with 
fighting 
a 
terminal 
disease 
that also raises some concern. 
Dealing with cancer as both 
a patient and a loved one of a 
patient is painful, frustrating 
and often times overwhelming. 
Yet in “Life Sentence,” Stella’s 
years of cancer seem as breezy 
and adventurous as a study 
abroad trip to Paris. “Life 
Sentence” had the opportunity 
to make a poignant statement on 
restarting life after putting it on 
hold for so long, but instead they 
made cancer as easy to get over 
as a common cold and directed 
focus at mundane issues.
Obviously, 
people 
are 
still allowed to have normal 
problems and feelings after 
surviving a tragedy, but Hale’s 
quirky, boho-princess character 
goes about dealing with hers 
in a way that is so unlikeable 
you find yourself scoffing at 
everything she says or does. 
Not only are Hale’s unnecessary 
voiceovers sickly sweet, but her 
wide-eyed innocence is more 
childish than endearing. This 
is essentially a coming-of-age 
story for a married woman who 
is well into her 20s and carries 
a Danny Tanner-esque desire to 
fix everyone else’s problems. 
The most redeemable scene 

of the show comes at the end, 
and is delivered not by look-
at-how-cute-my-moped-is 
Stella, but rather her Jim-
Harbaugh-looking 
father 
(Dylan Walsh,”Longmire”). At 
a backyard family party, Mr. 
Abbott breaks down, crying 
out to his family that he’s been 
scared everyday for the past 
eight years that he was going to 
lose his little girl, but knew he 
had to be strong for the family 
and couldn’t show that he was 
hurting. It is the only instance 
in “Life Sentence” in which 
there is any real substance, 
and 
that 
demonstrates 
the 
ugly, devastating truth about 

cancer that the rest of the show 
willingly skips over.
Much like its main character, 
“Life Sentence” is going to need 
a miracle to stay alive. While 
other shows have mastered 
the art of turning normal 
people’s problems into exciting 
and emotional shows, “Life 
Sentence” just feels empty and 
confused. Stella Abbott has a lot 
of growing up to do, but she’s 
already won one of life’s biggest, 
hardest battles. The rest should 
be easy, so really, there’s no 
point in sticking around to find 
out.

Before 
Sunday’s 
NCAA 

Tournament selection show, 
John Beilein stood up from his 
chair and addressed a crowd of 
Maize Rage students.

“In 2008-09, we broke the 

streak,” Beilein said. “There 
had 
been 
11 
years 
where 

Michigan hadn’t been in the 
tournament. And it was very 
different than this atmosphere 
because we didn’t know if we 
were in or not. … It never gets 
old.

“We don’t know where we’re 

gonna go, we don’t really care. 
We don’t care where we seeded, 
that we’re Big Ten champions 
again.”

Beilein 
spoke 
with 
a 

businesslike intonation. The 
upcoming 
hour, 
though 
— 

when Michigan would learn 

of its matchup as a No. 3 seed 
against No. 14 seed Montana 
in Wichita, Kan. — would be 
playful and animated.

Michigan State was placed 

as a No. 3 seed in the final spot 
in Detroit, and boos cascaded 
forward. When the final spot 
for Boise, Id. was decided, 
freshman forward Isaiah Livers 
grabbed his chest in relief. The 
team smiled and chattered.

Then, 
the 
Wolverines 

learned their tournament fate 
would begin in Wichita with a 
Thursday 9:50 p.m. tipoff, and 
John Beilein high-fived his 
players. Almost all of the roster 
has never been to Wichita — 
Beilein included — and they 
too switched to a businesslike 
demeanor.

“I don’t know too much,” 

said freshman guard Jordan 
Poole. “Obviously, it’s a place 
where we can go, we can lock in 

and do anything and get some 
wins.

“Being able to go out there 

and see a team like a Montana — 
this is our job, and this is what 
we’re here for, so we’ve got a lot 
of confidence.”

Following 
a 

few minutes of 
repartee after the 
announcement, 
the 
Michigan 

players huddled 
around 
Beilein 

to discuss their 
next steps. For 
the first time in 
over a week, the 
Wolverines could get ready 
with a studiable opponent in 
mind.

For junior forward Moritz 

Wagner, it’s the last piece of the 
puzzle to start a tournament 
run.

“You kinda know each other 

so well it’s hard to take that 
next step,” he said of the team’s 
practices. “I know Jon Teske, 
I know everything he does. … 
(Preparing for an opponent 
is) more specific and more 

interesting. 
Being on the road 
is fun too for a 
cool event.”

Wagner, 

though, 
will 

be 
back 
in 

unfamiliar 
territory.

“I know it’s in 

Kansas. I know 
Kansas 
and 

Missouri have something going 
on there with Kansas City, 
right?” Wagner said. “I just got 
to know that their names were 
the Montana Grizzlies. I just 
don’t know them at all. They’re 
very good probably because 
they’re in the Tournament, 

they’ve got 26 wins. That’s a lot 
of wins. You’ve gotta respect 
that, approach it like it’s the 
last game of the season.”

For 
fifth-year 
Duncan 

Robinson, he approaches it 
like it’s the last game of his 
collegiate career. In his first 
season with the Wolverines in 
2015-16, they were bounced in 
the Round of 64. Then last year 
came Michigan’s surprise run 
to the Sweet Sixteen. Now, it’s 
about an Elite Eight appearance 
or better.

“The first few years — it’s 

kinda funny my first two years, 
I got my feet wet,” Robinson 
said. “But now in my final 
year, I don’t want it to end so 
hopefully we can keep it going 
as long as possible.”

As for Beilein, his attitude 

was mainly level throughout 
the 
evening. 
A 
man 
with 

little concern about the exact 

opponent or seed or location. 
He 
knows 
the 
danger 
of 

sleeping 
on 
a 
double-digit 

seeded team — his 14-seeded 
Richmond team topped No. 3 
South Carolina in 1997.

His 
stoic 
outlook, 
of 

course, didn’t mean he wasn’t 
pleased. Beilein is happy that 
the Wolverines will play on 
Thursday instead of Friday — 
one less day his team has to 
wait after an extended break. 
The No. 3 seed, he believes, 
validates the progression his 
team experienced throughout 
the season.

But Beilein can only smile 

for so long before he drinks 
his 7:30 a.m. coffee tomorrow 
morning and game-plans for 
the Grizzlies himself.

“I try to answer most texts,” 

he said. “Any congratulations 
coming in will have to wait. I’ll 
be focused on Montana.”

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

I

t began with the obvious.

Michigan was the 17th 

team to have its name called, 

but everyone in the room knew 
that would happen eight days 
ago. The cheers came anyway.

Then 

Saddi Wash-
ington 
started clap-
ping as CBS 
prepared to 
announce the 
No. 2 seed 
in the East. 
It would 
have landed 
Michigan 
in Detroit. 
But Purdue’s name was called, 
and that same enthusiasm was 
brought to a halt.

Then the three seeds started 

dwindling.

Eventually, though, the Wol-

verines were given theirs. Now 
a date with Montana in Wichita, 
Kan. awaits.

It’s no secret that it took a lot 

of change to get here.

Moritz Wagner needed to start 

Moritz Wagnering. Zavier Simp-
son needed to clear every hurdle 
to become this team’s starting 
point guard. And Michigan need-
ed to follow his lead en route to 
becoming a defensive nightmare. 
The list could go on.

But now John Beilein has a 

new challenge on his hands. He 
needs to prepare for a team that 
he admittedly knows very little 
about. He jokes his players will 
have the easy part of it in the 
next 24 hours. Wagner jokes that, 
with no disrespect, all he knows 
is that Montana’s mascot is the 
Grizzlies — which is “pretty 
cool.”

And yet, the situation isn’t 

entirely foreign.

“This happened a few years 

ago when we played the South 
Dakota (State) Jackrabbits,” 
Beilein said. “We knew very 
little about them. We sorta had 
to figure a few things out. I’m 

much more familiar with some of 
the other teams that we could’ve 
played. That doesn’t mean any-
thing. We’ll get as ready as we 
can.”

***

At this point, it may be worth 

bringing up the scrimmage — not 
because of what happened in it, 
but because of who was on the 
other sideline.

It was closed to media and 

fans, but marked the first time 
the Wolverines played anyone but 
themselves this year. Toledo was 
their opponent and their host, 
and the matchup was as official 
as it could be without it counting 
on either team’s résumé.

It’s where you could have 

found Kyle Barlow — Toledo’s 
assistant coach and a former 

graduate manager for John 
Beilein.

Barlow moved to Toledo as 

the director of operations after 
the 2014 season before being pro-
moted to assistant coach this past 
year. He still exchanges texts 
with Beilein now and then, and 
they often see each other on the 
recruiting trail.

And it just so happens Barlow’s 

first year under Beilein came in 
2012-13. I think you remember 
how that season ended.

“That was very lucky,” Barlow 

said over the phone Friday after-
noon, “and good timing.”

What you may not remember 

is who Michigan played in the 
first round that year — none 
other than South Dakota State.

As Barlow recalled, he had 

two major responsibilities that 
year. The first was overseeing the 
manager program. The second 
was opponent scouting. He, along 
with a video coordinator, would 
“do a lot of the leg work”— cut-
ting clips and generating scout-
ing reports before presenting it 
to the coaching staff for further 
tweaking.

“That was probably my favor-

ite part,” Barlow says, “was just 
the film study and growing in 
that aspect.”

It’s in Barlow that you can 

find one of the plenty third-party 
observers that have found them-
selves a part of Beilein’s coaching 
tree.

Though he was unable to 

speak on record about the scrim-
mage itself, he says he tries to 

watch the Wolverines as much as 
he can.

He even admits Toledo’s 

offense does similar things to 
Michigan’s.

“Honestly,” he joked, “I try to 

steal a lot of stuff that they do 
and kind of make it our own.”

That, along with plenty of the 

staff’s own work, clearly worked 
out. The Rockets finished 23-11, 
and they came 10 points shy of 
earning an automatic bid in the 
Mid-American Conference Tour-
nament championship.

***

But let’s return to 2013 for a 

moment.

There aren’t many parallels 

you can find between this year’s 
iteration of Michigan and one 
that had a roster with six future 

NBA draft picks, other than both 
being pegged to make a run in 
March.

As Barlow recalls, the first 

took pride in being flat-out tal-
ented. It helped that they had 
Naismith winner Trey Burke, 
too. This year, though, Barlow 
sees something different.

“I think they have more of a 

chip on their shoulder,” he says. 
“And that starts with Zavier 
Simpson, that they take pride in 
defense and really just shutting 
opponents down and almost like 
embarrassing the opponents — 
not embarrassing them in a bad 
way, but just shutting them down 
to the point where they don’t look 
like (themselves).”

For Barlow, though, there is 

one parallel worth noting.

“To be honest, the only simi-

larity I’ve seen is that they’ve 
continually gotten better,” he 
said.

He added: “You know, it’s hard 

to find (a team’s strength) some-
times at the beginning of the 
year. But in the middle of the year 
and toward the end of the year, 
he always seems to find it and 
they play to their potential — and 
probably above their potential.”

That progress, as always, trac-

es back to Beilein.

With examples abound, Bar-

low’s experience as a self-admit-
ted “fly on the wall” serves as one 
instance within a collective.

“He would listen to every-

body,” Barlow recalls. “He was 
like a mad scientist when it came 
to that. … I bet he does practice 
plans four or five different times 
before he actually settles on a 
final one. He’s just that kind of 
guy.”

Victor Frankenstein had his 

monster. Beilein, again, has his.

He may know little to nothing 

about Montana. But that hasn’t 
been a problem before.

In Montana, Beilein faces a familiarly unfamiliar challenge

SPORTSMONDAY COLUMN

Michigan set to challenge in manageable West

After a week-long respite 

following 
its 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament 
championship, 

the Michigan men’s basketball 
team finally has its NCAA 
Tournament path.

The 3rd-seeded Wolverines 

will face No. 14 seed Montana 
on 
Thursday 
afternoon 
in 

Wichita, Kan. Michigan will 
be in the West Region, with 
Xavier and North Carolina as 
the two higher-seeded teams, 
respectively. 

“We’re flattered that we have 

a 3 seed,” Michigan coach John 
Beilein told reporters shortly 
after the bracket was unveiled 
Sunday evening, “but as I said to 
everybody, a 2, 3, 4 seed doesn’t 
make a difference because who 
can tell what the 12, 13, 14, 15 
seeds are like? They’re all the 
same, too. They’ve got to put 
some numbers into a hat and 
see how it’ll all look.”

Beilein said his assistants 

and staff would be up late into 
the night trying to learn about 
the Grizzlies.

“Nothing,” Beilein said with 

a few chuckles when asked 
what he knows about his 
opponent. “We played them 
when I was at West Virginia in 
a tournament, but it was many 
coaches ago.

“I guarantee I will not be 

laughing (tomorrow).”

Montana 
is 
ranked 
71st 

according 
to 
KenPom.com, 

and was 0-4 against teams 
in the KenPom.com top 100. 
It finished 26-7, winning the 
Big Sky regular season and 
tournament title.

If Michigan is able to take 

care of Montana, it would 
face the winner of No. 6 seed 
Houston and No. 11 seed San 
Diego 
State. 
The 
Cougars 

currently sit at 17th in the 
KenPom.com 
rankings, 
the 

highest of any 6 seed in the 
field. They fell just a point shy of 
winning the American Athletic 
Conference 
Tournament, 

losing 
56-55 
to 
Cincinnati 

in the tournament final on 
Sunday. On short rest, they 

would 
indisputably 
present 

a challenge before perhaps 
the 
most 
highly-anticipated 

matchup in the region.

But if both teams take care 

of 
their 
lower-seeded 
first 

weekend opponents, Michigan 
and 
North 
Carolina 
would 

square off in Los Angeles for 
a spot in the Elite Eight. The 
game would be a rematch of an 
early November contest that 
the Tar Heels won handily, 
86-71.

North 
Carolina 
forward 

Luke Maye imposed his will 
on fifth-year senior forward 
Duncan Robinson in that one, 
scoring 27 points.

After 
that 
contest, 
a 

disappointed John Beilein told 
the media “(North Carolina) 
might be that good, but we’re 
definitely not that bad.

“Just watch this team grow, 

you’ll like what they do.”

Following an embarassing 

loss, that statement was met 
with ambivalence. But it has 
proven true throughout the 
progression of the season.

Since then, the Tar Heels 

have played up to snuff, fighting 
at or near the top of the ACC as 

a defending national champion 
is expected to do. They won 25 
games — including two over 
arch-rival Duke — and lost in 
the ACC Tournament final 
Saturday night.

Michigan, of course, has 

flipped the script just as Beilein 
foretold.

The Wolverines improved 

steadily, reaching a crescendo 
at the Big Ten Tournament, 
where they ripped off four wins 
in 
four 
days, 

including 
two 

against 
top-5 

opponents. For 
many 
reasons, 

a 
rematch 

would 
be 
a 

whole different 
ballgame. 
And 

junior 
center 

Moritz Wagner 
would 
like 
to 

find out.

“We 
were 

a different team back then,” 
Wagner said. “That’s definitely 
something, as a competitor, you 
would look forward to.”

And if it were to advance 

past North Carolina, Michigan 
would need to win one more 

game 
— 
possibly 
against 

Atlantic 
10 
regular 
season 

champion 
Xavier 
or 
West 

Coast Conference champion 
Gonzaga — to make the once-
unimaginable 
trip 
to 
San 

Antonio for the Final Four.

It’s no longer unimaginable. 

Beilein and his team would 
never entertain those chances, 
of course. But the Wolverines 
are one of the hottest teams 
in the country, riding a nine-

game 
winning 

streak 
into 

the Big Dance. 
Michigan 
will 

be 
a 
trendy 

pick 
in 
your 

bracket pool. It 
currently 
has 

the 
fifth-best 

odds to win the 
national title at 
10/1, according 
to Westgate Las 
Vegas.

And it avoided the gauntlet 

of, say, the South Region, 
filled with heavyweights like 
Virginia, Kentucky, Arizona, 
Cincinnati and Tennessee. 

The bracket is set. Let the 

madness begin.

Bakich, Michigan plagued by errors in series loss to Lipscomb

There’s no sugarcoating it. 

The Wolverines are rebuilding.

“We’d like to think that 

coming into this season that 
we’ve put ourselves into a 
position to reload and not 
rebuild,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Baikich, “but clearly we’re 
rebuilding right now.”

There was plenty of buzz 

surrounding 
the 
young 

Michigan baseball team heading 
into the season, but after a 
series 2-1 loss to Lipscomb, the 
team’s ability is beginning to be 
questioned.

All weekend, the Wolverines 

(4-10) struggled to find a groove 
offensively and committed a 
total of seven defensive errors 
over the three contests.

The 
defense 
this 
season 

is particularly troubling, as 
Michigan boasted one of the 
best defensive squads in the 
country a year ago. The dip 
in defensive prowess could be 
attributed to youth and the 
adjustment to the pace of college 
ball, or even to the challenges of 
consistently playing on the road. 
Nevertheless, it exists.

“There are no strengths when 

you’re 4-10,” Bakich said. “We 
need to get better at everything. 
It’s the little things that are 
turning into big things. You 
don’t collect outs on a bunt, you 
don’t communicate and throw 
to the wrong base. Things that 
don’t always show up in the 
scorebook.”

Heading 
into 
the 
series 

against the Bison, Michigan was 
looking to bounce back from a 
demoralizing spring break road 
trip. Winning only one of eight 
games in California, a big game 
was needed.

That’s exactly what it got on 

Friday, although not without 
some major hiccups. Junior 
Jonathan 
Engelmann 
led 

the offensive charge as the 
Wolverines’ bats were hot early. 

Securing three hits off six 
at-bats, Engelmann drove three 
batters in and did his part to 
secure the win.

The scoring climaxed in a five-

run fifth inning, 
propelling 
the 

Wolverines 
to 

a 
commanding 

13-1 lead. Then 
complacency 
kicked in with 
Michigan’s 
pitching 
and 

defense, allowing 
Lipscomb 
to 

score 
10 
runs 

in the last four 
innings.

The comeback surge wasn’t 

enough, 
as 
the 
Wolverines 

closed out just well enough to 

secure the victory.

“The best part of the weekend 

was the way we came out on 
Friday and scored in the first five 
innings and had a lot of quality 

at-bats,” Bakich 
said. 
“Then, 

after those first 
five innings, we 
just got sloppy 
and 
continued 

to progressively 
get 
sloppy 

throughout 
the 

rest of the time.”

After 
that 

monumental 
fifth 
inning 

Friday, 
Michigan 
could 
not 

catch a break. The Wolverines 
had gone 4-0 in all previous 
matchups against Lipscomb, yet 

dropped the next two games.

Saturday’s 
contest 
began 

optimistically 
for 
the 

Wolverines. 
After 
three 

scoreless 
innings, 
Michigan 

exploded onto the scoreboard, 
securing four runs off three hits. 
But this marked the last time the 
Wolverines would lead in the 
game.

Despite 
a 
strong 
start, 

sophomore right-hander Karl 
Kauffman gave up five runs 
to the Bison in the bottom of 
the fifth. Heading into this 
reckoning, 
Kauffman 
had 

tossed eight strikeouts and held 
Lipscomb to only one run.

Michigan 
then 
sent 
in 

freshman 
left-hander 
Ben 

Dragani in relief. A rare bright 
spot on the squad, Dragani 

pitched three scoreless innings 
after closing out the brutal fifth 
inning for Kauffman.

Dragani’s last two outings 

have been incredibly strong, 
labeling 
him 

as one of the 
team’s 
premier 

relievers.

“He’s 
had 

success because 
he’s 
been 

aggressive with 
all of his pitches 
in 
the 
strike 

zone,” 
Bakich 

said. “He’s been 
consistently 
a 

strike-thrower every time he’s 
been out there and he’s executed 
the pitch call and game plan. He’s 
done a nice job. He’ll continue to 

get more opportunities and he 
may have his role expanded.”

Despite 
Dragani’s 
valiant 

effort, the Wolverines’ fate had 
already been sealed. A sluggish 
offense held Michigan down all 
game. It failed to record a hit 
in the last four innings, ending 
their undefeated reign over the 
Bison.

Sunday’s matchup was much 

of the same. The Wolverines 
started 
hot, 
recording 
two 

runs in the top of the first, 
but ultimately succumbed to 
defensive errors and ineffective 
bats.

Lipscomb ostensibly ended 

things in the third by scoring 
three runs and holding onto its 
lead.

If nothing else, the latter two 

games in the series will teach 
the young team a lesson in what 
it takes to dig out of a deficit.

“Well, you just gotta string 

the positives together,” Bakich 
said. “On offense, it’s quality 
at bats and it’s passing the 
baton to the next guy and just 
everybody trying to get on 
base. Defensively, it’s just being 
consistent in making routine 
plays and communicating.”

This series marks the end of 

Michigan’s road tour. It will now 
enjoy the comfort of playing in 
its own stadium as the 24-game 
home 
schedule 
begins 
on 

Tuesday.

“There’s always an advantage 

to 
being 
at 

home,” 
Bakich 

said. “But, good 
teams play well 
on the road too 
and we haven’t 
played well on 
the road, and if 
we want to be a 
good team then 
we have to be 
better 
on 
the 

road.”

It remains to be seen whether 

the Wolverines can turn things 
around, but so far one sentiment 
is clear: prepare for a rebuild.

SOFTBALL

‘M’ sweeps Florida Atlantic Tournament

It might have taken sun-soaked 

trips to Florida and California to 
get there, but the No. 22 Michigan 
softball team is hitting, pitching 
and winning at a red-hot rate.

At the FAU Parents’ Weekend 

Tournament, the Wolverines swept 
their five-game slate, beating Stony 
Brook, Florida Atlantic, Ball State, 
Pittsburgh and Florida A&M, to 
bring their win streak to 12 games.

From the outset against Stony 

Brook, Michigan looked like a 
team riding a seven-game win 
streak. Though the Wolverines 
had some trouble earlier in the 
season capitalizing with runners 
in scoring position, this was not 
the case Friday in a 7-0 win. Junior 
third 
baseman 
Alex 
Sobczak 

etched the ball along the first 
baseline with two outs in the 
second inning, allowing Michigan 
to score.

The Wolverines never looked 

back on Friday, riding the bats of 
second baseman Faith Canfield 
and right-hander/first baseman 
Tera Blanco. Blanco hit a sac fly 
against the Sea Wolves in the fifth 
inning and Canfield followed that 
with a three-run double an inning 
later.

Blanco followed up her play 

against Stony Brook with a home 
run on the first pitch of the sixth 
inning against Florida Atlantic, and 
Canfield followed her up at the end 

of the inning with a two-run mash 
of her own. Michigan coach Carol 
Hutchins noticed a more confident 
batting lineup throughout the 
tournament and in the 7-1 win.

“Honestly, I notice when we’re 

confident as a team, when we’re all 
together,” Hutchins said. “There’s 
only one player batting at a time 
but the entire dugout has to bat 
with every player every pitch. 
When the entire dugout is locked in 
every pitch, I see a lot more success 
offensively.”

That’s not to say, though, that 

the tournament was a complete 
walk in the park for the Michigan. 
If Friday was a sunny day at the 
beach, Saturday was more like a 
roller-coaster ride at Disney World 
or Busch Gardens 
with a pair of 3-2 
wins.

Against 
Ball 

State, 
Michigan 

was 
instead 

anchored 
by 

freshman 
right-

hander 
Meghan 

Beaubien. The ace 
tossed a career-
high 16 strikeouts. 
Even though the 
Wolverines never trailed in the 
game, the Cardinals put some 
pressure on Michigan by launching 
a two-run home run in the sixth 
inning.

In the seventh inning the 

Wolverines 
loaded 
the 
bases, 

putting sophomore third baseman 

Madison Uden on the plate. Uden, 
who has been hitting a team-
leading .396, drew a walk-off walk 
to give Michigan the victory.

“I was really just looking to drive 

the ball, hit a really good pitch,” 
Uden said. “Just looking to throw 
my backside hard and just focusing 
on what I know and trusting my 
mechanics.”

Beaubien followed her career 

outing with a similarly dominant 
performance against Pittsburgh. 
With 
the 
Wolverines 
leading 

3-2 coming into the fifth inning, 
the ace took over and retired the 
Panthers’ last nine batters to close 
out the game. On a day where 
Michigan recorded twenty hits but 
only scored six runs, her arm was 

the 
difference, 

and 
remains 
a 

constant for the 
Wolverines in the 
circle.

“Well, 
it 
is 

important to win 
close 
games,” 

Hutchins 
said. 

“It’s great for our 
pitching 
to 
be 

tough and solid 
under 
perceived 

pressure, and definitely you wanna 
come up on the winning side of it 
because that gives you confidence 
that you can win those games and 
you don’t want the kids just focused 
on winning but ultimately we all 
know that when the game gets 
tight is when the kids get tight.”

Just like it has over the course 

of the season, Michigan improved 
on its hitting inconsistencies on 
Sunday against Florida A&M, 
combining those improvements 
with the as-usual stellar pitching 
to notch a 6-2 win over the 
Rattlesnakes. Uden went 4-for-4 
with two runs and Blanco notched 
a season high seven strikeouts.

Florida A&M might not be the 

most intimidating opponent, but 
the 
Wolverines’ 
performance 

against them, and the rest of the 
unranked teams in Boca Raton, 
bodes well for their upcoming 
conference slate. If they can 
do it thousands of miles away 
from home, they can bring some 
sunshine back to Ann Arbor, too.

Michigan falls to Ohio State, 3-2, in overtime thriller 

COLUMBUS — The Big Ten 

semifinal had all of the ingredients 
for a classic showdown. There 
was an NHL arena, a streaking 
Michigan team and a consistently 
powerful Buckeye offense that 
has managed to prevail in all 
four of the teams’ matchups this 
season.

The No. 11 Wolverines (11-

11-3 Big Ten, 20-14-3 overall) 
— coming off a late-season push 
— had the chance to claim a win 
over the only Big Ten team they 
hadn’t been able to topple to date.

With neither team finding the 

advantage in regulation, it would 
take a wrist shot from Ohio State 
center Matthew Weis in overtime 
to lock the win, 3-2.

“We won’t find many teams 

better than Ohio State,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. “So, 
I think we can really take some 
positives from this game. We’re 
not happy about the outcome, 
but we’re happy with some of the 
things we did in the game.”

At the outset of the game’s 

highly-anticipated 
faceoff, 
it 

wasn’t entirely clear which team 
would assert the upper hand.

“We knew what we had to do 

coming in,” said senior right wing 
Tony Calderone. “We had to get 
pucks behind them and get their 
defensemen working.”

The Wolverines let loose the 

first six shots of the game, and 
while they successfully claimed 
the momentum early, it would 
be the sixth-ranked Buckeyes 
(15-8-2, 24-8-5) that would go 
on to counter those early efforts, 
outshooting Michigan 35-31.

After a called-off goal due to 

a delayed penalty around seven 
minutes into play that saw Ohio 
State 
forward 
John 
Wiitala 

punch the puck past sophomore 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne, it 
was evident that Ohio State was 
starting to flex its touted high-
output offense.

Buckeye 
forwards 
Mason 

Jobst — who has a team-leading 
41 points — Brendon Kearney 
and Wiitala spearheaded the 
aforementioned early pressure, 
producing numerous gasps from 
the crowd as Lavigne’s saves were 
seemingly too close for comfort.

And 
with 
3:58 
remaining 

in the first period, Ohio State 
defenseman Gordi Myer blasted 
the puck up and over Lavigne’s 
glove on the man advantage to 

take first blood, showing off 
why the Buckeyes’ power play is 
ranked eighth in the nation.

But while their stat sheet at 

the end of the first would suggest 
complete dominance, freshman 
defenseman Quinn Hughes drove 
down the ice halfway through 
the period and loosed a wristshot 
that ricocheted off the post, 
proving that the Wolverines were 
within reach of slipping one past 
Sean Romero.

Michigan spent the first ten 

minutes of the second period 
relentlessly chipping away at the 
Ohio State defense, and its efforts 
finally yielded fruit thanks to 
a diving Cooper Marody who 
patted a loose puck down and 
flipped it past Romero.

The junior center’s equalizer 

clearly helped change the tide of 
the game, completely reversing 
the trend in momentum that was 
formerly in the Buckeyes’ favor.

But just as the Wolverines 

could have ridden a scoring wave 
to take the upper hand, Calderone 
committed a holding penalty 
that saw a subsequent onslaught 
of shots from Jobst and others, 
which Lavigne barely staved off.

Hughes, along with senior left 

wing Dexter Dancs and the rest 

of the Wolverines’ attacking arm, 
continued applying pressure to 
the stalwart Buckeye defense at 
the outset of the third period, but 
Romero and his back line kept 
shrugging off shots and cross-ice 
passes with ease.

“(Hughes is) worth the price 

of admission,” Pearson said. “It 
was one of those games, he had 
a couple post, crossbar, one of 
those goes in it could change the 
outcome of the game because it 
came down to one shot.”

And with four penalties to 

Ohio State’s one — the most recent 
being a holding-the-stick call on 
Hughes — Buckeye center Dakota 
Joshua made Michigan pay on the 
power play with a deflection over 
Lavigne’s head to give them a 2-1 
lead.

Ohio State’s euphoria was 

short-lived, though, as Marody 
graciously spun through the slot 
on the man advantage, slipping 
the puck right past Romero’s left 
blocker to tie the game at two 
apiece.

But in the end, Weis found the 

back of the net for the Buckeyes. 
They 
upheld 
their 
winning 

streak against the Wolverines 
and earned a place in the Big Ten 
Tournament final.

Wolverines learn from loss, prepare for NCAA Tournament

COLUMBUS 
— 
Barring 

unforeseen circumstances, the 
No. 11 Michigan hockey team has 
punched its ticket to the NCAA 
Tournament.

The 
berth 
comes 
despite 

a 3-2 overtime loss to No. 6 
Ohio State in Saturday’s Big 
Ten 
Tournament 
semifinals. 

The Wolverines (20-14-3) fell 
just three spots to No. 10 in the 
PairWise rankings, still safely 
within the top 16 teams to receive 
at-large bids to the postseason 
tournament.

A 
victory 
in 
Columbus 

would’ve added to Michigan’s 
seven-game winning streak and 
a chance at the conference title. 
It also would have elevated the 
team’s pride for defeating its 
rival after bowing in all four 
regular-season showdowns.

The first single-elimination 

loss of the season sent the 
Wolverines home for an idle 
week before learning about their 
tournament fate. But Michigan 
experienced 
the 
perfect 

precursor to playoff hockey 
against a Buckeyes team (24-
8-5) with the nation’s fourth-
best offense and power play and 
college hockey’s best penalty 
kill.

Now, Michigan coach Mel 

Pearson’s squad has time to iron 
out the kinks.

“I’ve liked the growth of our 

team,” he said after the game. “If 
we’re fortunate to get into that 
(NCAA) Tournament, this is a 
good warmup for that because 
you won’t find many teams 
better than Ohio State.

“We’re not happy about the 

outcome, but we’re happy with 
some of the things we did in the 
game. Things to build on and 
improve on.”

First, the positives.
Outscored 15-6 in the first 

four duels against the Buckeyes, 
the Wolverines were one shot 
away from tying — or upsetting 
— the host team. The first two 

Ohio State goals were answered 
by Michigan, both off the stick of 
junior forward Cooper Marody.

After allowing a power play 

goal late in the 
first 
period, 

the 
Wolverines 

responded 
halfway through 
the 
second 
to 

momentarily 
silence 
Nationwide 
Arena. 
They 

maintained 
pressure in the 
zone with three 
shots on net in a minute, before 
a loose rebound batted around 
in the crease. Finding the puck 
in front of him, Marody grabbed 
it in the air, placed it at his feet 
and, while falling, flipped a 
wobbler past Buckeye goaltender 

Sean Romero to tie the game at 
one apiece.

Early in the third frame, 

Ohio State would regain the 

one-goal 
lead 

— again on the 
man 
advantage 

— when a shot 
from the point 
was 
redirected 

off three skaters 
and crept past 
sophomore 
goaltender 
Hayden Lavigne.

But 
Marody 

was back at it 

again just three minutes later. 
Seven seconds into a Wolverines’ 
power play, he produced another 
highlight goal. Entering the 
slot, his body spun toward the 
goal, and he ripped the puck 
past Romero’s left pad for the 

equalizer with 12:33 remaining.

Despite generating both goals, 

Marody instead credited his 
teammates.

“That was just showing how 

great (freshman defenseman) 
Quinn Hughes is,” Marody said. 
“He was weaving inside, outside 
and all over the zone. We had 
(senior forwards Dexter Dancs 
and Tony Calderone) working 
really hard, and I just tried to 
bang it in. It shows you how good 
my linemates are.”

Hughes also added three shots, 

two assists and two clean looks 
at the net that blitzed Romero, 
but both were stopped by the 
post. The youngest player in 
college hockey evaded defenders 
with 
wizardly 
stickhandling 

to 
establish 
quality 
scoring 

chances.

But there were also negatives.

It 
started 
with 
untimely 

and avoidable penalties. Four 
shorthanded sequences against 
a 
destructive 
power 
play 

spelled 
disaster 

for 
Michigan’s 

penalty kill, the 
nation’s 
fourth-

worst with just 
a 75.34 percent 
success 
rate. 

After outplaying 
Ohio 
State 
at 

even 
strength, 

the 
Buckeyes 

would convert on 
two of four man 
advantages.

Pearson also cited faceoffs 

as an area to be stressed in 
preparation 
for 
the 
NCAA 

Tournament. 
The 
Buckeyes 

won a lopsided 35 draws to the 
Wolverines’ 22.

“That’s just an indication of 

the urgency and the desperation, 
and the will and the want and 
the intensity,” Pearson said. 
“We’ve got to be better there.”

With 
16 
players 
on 
the 

Wolverine 
roster 
without 

NCAA Tournament experience, 
Pearson is hyper-focused on 
injecting an extreme desire to 
fend elimination.

“You have to make sure you’re 

absolutely ready, do everything 
in your power to be ready to play,” 
Pearson said. “I’ve been through 
it for 22 years at Michigan, and 
I’ve been through a couple of 
last years in other schools so I 
get it, I’ve seen it and I think I’ve 
got a good idea of what it takes 
to prepare. But our players, you 
can’t give them that experience.”

Going into Saturday night’s 

contest, Pearson told his skaters 
they weren’t attending a ballet, 
but instead a boxing match.

The same mantra applies to 

the rest of the postseason.

During the second half of the 

season, Michigan went 7-0-1 in 
its last eight entering Saturday 
and 8-3-1-1 to end the conference 
season. It gracefully leapt from 
win to win down the stretch — 
save three losses to Ohio State 
and one to Wisconsin — but is 
resolute to exchange slippers for 
boxing gloves to stand a chance 
in the ring against hockey’s best 

teams ahead.

No matter its 

status 
as 
one 

of 
the 
hottest 

teams, Michigan 
learned Saturday 
night that one 
loss in a single-
elimination 
scenario 
brings the end 
to 
its 
come-

from-behind, 

storybook season. And Pearson 
knows it.

“The next time we won’t get a 

next time,” he said. “You can call 
that pressure or you can call it 
opportunity, but you can’t hide 
from it.”

Uden’s hard work pays off

The work done by athletes 

behind the scenes and in the 
offseason 
pays 
dividends 

throughout the course of a 
season for both the player and 
the team. The latest example 
of this for the No. 22 Michigan 
softball team took place in the 
bottom of the seventh inning 
against Ball State this past 
Saturday.

The bases were loaded with 

two outs in a game tied at two. 
Sophomore infielder Madison 
Uden stepped up to the plate — 
hitless on the day. 

In the game’s key at-bat, 

Uden focused on remaining 
relaxed, looking for a good 
pitch to hit. She didn’t get the 
pitch she was looking for, but 
instead drew the count full 
before watching ball four miss 
the zone.

The 
final 
play 
of 
the 

game was by no means a 
glamorous walk-off. However, 
it demonstrated the progress 
Uden has made since last 
season and earned the win for 
her team.

“I commended her after 

that Ball State walk-off walk 
because last year’s (Uden) 
might have torn herself out 
of the at-bat,” said Michigan 
coach 
Carol 

Hutchins. 
“I 

think 
she’s 

matured.”

Last 
year, 

Uden 
was 
a 

.255 hitter who 
appeared 
in 

fewer than half 
of 
the 
team’s 

games. 
This 

year, 
she 
is 

hitting a team-
high .396 over 48 at-bats and 
has played in 19 of 24 games 
thus far. Over the weekend, she 
tallied nine hits in five games 
and has recorded a hit in six 

of the last seven games. Her 
recent hot streak, however, 
didn’t come overnight.

“I did a lot of vision training 

in the offseason,” Uden said. 
“Just focusing on getting better 
pitches and being consistent 
with my mechanics and really 
working on my timing.”

Her offseason focus on a 

more patient approach and the 
emphasis on vision training 
clearly showed in the victory 
over the Cardinals. In the 
biggest at-bat of the game, 
Uden 
remained 
cool 
and 

collected, unfazed by the heat 
of the moment — a testament to 
her offseason training. 

The work put in throughout 

the 
offseason 
paid 
off, 

resulting in a win for the team 
and more playing time at third 
base for Uden.

“I think she’s done a nice 

job of staying within herself,” 
Hutchins 
said. 
“We’re 
not 

asking her to do any more 
than she’s ever been capable 
of doing. I’m pleased with the 
progress, and we’re giving her 
some looks at third base.”

Uden’s emergence as an 

offensive threat was a big part 
of the Wolverines’ perfect 
weekend and current 12-game 
winning streak. With Big Ten 
play less than two weeks away, 
Uden is hitting her stride right 

in time as her 
confidence and 
focus is at a 
season-high.

“We’re 

trying to find 
who’s 
gonna 

lead 
us 
and 

who’s 
gonna 

step up when 
we need them,” 
Hutchins said. 
“Who can we 

count on to get things done for 
us and ultimately, we’re just 
trying to create a trust within 
the entire unit and it takes all 
of them to win.”
