A look at transgender rights on campus

State government 

gridlocked on 

transgender student 

accomodations

By LYDIA MURRAY

Summer Managing News Editor

Amid 
national 
controversy 

over transgender rights, local and 
University of Michigan policies 
have 
moved 
toward 
a 
greater 

accommodation 
of 
transgender 

students, specifically the right to 
choose which restroom they prefer 
to use — despite the issue becoming 
controversial in state legislature.

The 
U.S. 
Departments 
of 

Education and Justice released joint 
guidance Friday to educators, aimed 

at fighting discrimination based on 
sex and particularly highlighting the 
protection of transgender students.

The 
guidance 
tells 
school 

administrations they must treat 
students consistently with their 
gender identity after being informed 
that the student is transgender, 
aimed at preventing bullying and 
discrimination 
of 
transgender 

students.

Under Title IX of the Education 

Amendments of 1972, any school 
receiving federal money is prohibited 
from discriminating against students 
based on sex, which is interpreted to 
include transgender students. The 
recent guidance reaffirms this policy, 
warning educators against Title IX 
violations.

U.S. Secretary of Education John 

King Jr. stated in a press release that 
all students — including transgender 

students — should be able to learn in 
a safe environment, as mandated by 
Title IX.

“No student should ever have to 

go through the experience of feeling 
unwelcome at school or on a college 
campus,” King said in a statement. 
“This guidance further clarifies what 
we’ve said repeatedly — that gender 
identity is protected under Title IX. 
Educators want to do the right thing 
for students, and many have reached 
out to us for guidance on how to 
follow the law.”

LGBT Michigan president Emily 

Kaufman, an LSA junior and a 
transgender woman, said she believes 
the 
Obama 
administration 
has 

recently taken important steps to help 
protect the transgender community.

“Generally, 
what 
the 
Obama 

administration has been saying in 
the past few weeks is that trans lives 

matter and that we are people,” she 
said. “There are all these negative 
stereotypes, 
so 
by 
the 
Obama 

administration doing these things, it 
will protect the most marginalized 
people, and it is really a big step 
forward.”

The 
Obama 
administration’s 

announcement 
follows 
recent 

controversy over a lawpassed in 
North Carolina, referred to as the 
North Carolina “bathroom bill,” 
which prohibits transgender people 
from using restrooms or locker rooms 
that do not match the gender on their 
birth certificates.

The bill has drawn heavy criticism 

from civil liberties groups, LGBTQ 
advocates and major businesses. 
Since its passage, several performers 
including Bruce Springsteen, Demi 
Lovato, Nick Jonas and the bands 
Pearl Jam and Boston cancelled 

concerts in North Carolina as a 
demonstration of protest protest. The 
bill additionally garnered praise from 
socially conservative groups like the 
Family Research Council.

Most 
recently, 
the 
Justice 

Department filed a civil rights lawsuit 
against the state of North Carolina. 
U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch 
said the suit represents more than just 
a battle over bathrooms, according to 
a May 9 statement. 

“This is about the dignity and 

respect that we accord our fellow 
citizens and the laws we have enacted 
as a country to protect them and to 
protect us,” Lynch said.

Supporters of North Carolina’s 

“bathroom 
bill” 
claim 
sexual 

predators can take advantage of 
the ability to enter the bathroom of 
their choice to attack others. Despite

Daily Summer News Editor

Ed Yong, an award-winning 

science writer for The Atlantic, and 
Jack Gilbert, a professor of surgery at 
the University of Chicago, discussed 
how microbes —communities of 
microscopic organisms that live 
on or in people, plants, soil, oceans 
and the atmosphere — affect life 
forms on Earth, and how they can 
be manipulated to improve human 
health during a session titled 
“Invisible Influence: Microbiomes 
in the World” Monday evening at 
the Rackham Amphitheater.

The session was part of the 

Michigan Meeting on Microbial 
Communities, 
a 
conference 

organized 
by 
the 
Center 
for 

Microbial Systems, which promotes 
the study of microbiology at the 
University. The conference, titled 
“Unseen Partners: Manipulating 
Microbial 
Communities 
that 

Support Life on Earth,” continues 
until Wednesday and features 
speakers with many different areas 
of expertise in microbes. 

Last week, the White House 

Office of Science and Technology 
Policy announced the National 
Microbial Initiative, an initiative to 
advocate the study of microbiomes. 
Dysfunctional microbiomes have 
been linked to many human 
diseases, disruptions in ecosystems 
and 
reduced 
agricultural 

productivity. 

Microbes — usually bacteria, 

fungi, viruses or protozoa — refer 
to any organism that is too small 
to be seen with naked eye. Some 
microbes are harmful for human 
health, as they cause diseases such 

as the common cold, chickenpox, 
malaria and pneumonia, but others 
are beneficial, such as the bacteria 
that live in intestines that help 
with absorbing nutrients from the 
processed food, according to the 
National Institutues of Health.

Yong 
began 
his 
talk 
by 

commenting on how ubiquitous 
and important microbes are for 
people and ecosystems, though it 
might be unsettling and unnerving 
to think the human body contains 
multitudes 
of 
microbes. 
Yong 

mentioned that many animals rely 
on microbes for essential tasks, such 
as digesting food.

In spite of how important 

microbiomes are for human health, 
Yong said the current understanding 
of microbes is insufficient partly 
due their complicated nature. For 
example, in some cases it is not 
certain whether the change in the 
microbiome causes a disease or if 
a disease results in a microbiome 
change.

Yong 
additionally 
discussed 

the inefficiency of probiotics to 
illustrate the complicated nature of 
microbiomes. According to Yong, 
the bacteria in probiotics might be 
too domesticated compared to the 
native gut bacteria to survive once 
they are in the digestive system, 
meaning any probiotic model may 
not clearly demonstrate all of the 
properties of natural microbiomes.

“The problem with probiotics 

… is that they contain highly 
domesticated bacteria,” Yong said. 
“The benefits (of probiotics) are 
unclear at best.”

On the other hand, Yong said

City Council decreases funding 
for Ann Arbor Connector plans 

FY 2017 budget cuts 

funding for next stage of 

project to 2 percent

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Summer News Editor

In a lengthy and — at times 

contentious — six-hour meeting 
Monday night, the Ann Arbor City 
Council amended and passed its $370 
million budget for the 2017 fiscal year.

The 
2017 
budget 
decreases 

expenditures by $10 million from 
fiscal year 2016 levels and increases 
the total city staff from 722 to 729. 
Public safety and law enforcement is 
the largest expense at $46.8 million, 
followed by employee pensions ($37.7 
million), payments on water and 
sewage bonds ($34.8 million and 
$33.7 million respectively), and road 
repairs ($23.9 million).

In addition, a total of 16 budget 

amendments, allocating about $1.3 
million in additional funds, were 
put forward by councilmembers for 
debate during the session.

The 
final 
budget 
allocates 

$345,000 for the amendments, with 
$100,000 going to the city’s affordable 
housing fund, $60,000 to outdoor 
wintertime ice rinks, $85,000 for 
citywide environmental initiatives, 
$15,000 for a study on removing a 
historical city-owned structure at 415 
W. Washington St., $75,000 additional 

funds for the city’s annual deer cull 
and $100,000 for the construction of 
additional streetlights.

Also of note was the city’s 

commitment to the Ann Arbor 
Connector project, which envisions a 
light rail line connecting the southern 
edge of the city, through downtown, 
Central Campus, the Medical Center 
and North Campus.

The 
project 
— 
which 
is 
a 

collaboration 
between 
the 
city, 

the University of Michigan, the 
Downtown Development Authority 
and the local transit authority — is 
expected to enter the next-stage, 
which involves a $3 to 4 million 
environmental impact study. City 
residents 
have 
recently 
voiced 

concerns that the primary beneficiary 
of the rail project would be the 
University, suggesting the city would 
be disproportionately shouldering 
a financial burden, despite the fact 
that the University has committed 
to funding at least 75 percent of the 
project, which is expected to cost 
hundreds of millions. 

The original budget planned for 

the city to contribute $184,000 to 
its share of the project’s next phase, 
but an amendment sponsored by 
councilmembers Graydon Krapohl 
(D–Ward 4) and Sabra Briere (D–
Ward 1) cut this figure by $90,000. 
The resolution narrowly passed 6-5, 
with support from Councilmembers 
Briere, Krapohl, Jane Lumm (I–Ward 
2), Sumi Kailasapathy (D–Ward 1), 
Jack Eaton (D–Ward 4) and Zachary 

Ackerman (D-Ward 3).

This 
means 
the 
city 
would 

contribute $60,000 to the estimated 
$3 million study and spend $34,000 
on staff training pertaining to the 
Connector. The University is planning 
to take 90 percent of the cost of the 
study, while TheRide will foot six 
percent of the bill and the city of Ann 
Arbor and Downtown Development 
Authority will each take two percent.

Councilmember 
Eaton, 
who 

supported the resolution, argued 
the city should fund the Connector 
project proportionally to how much 
it would benefit the city. The project 
is expected to cost at least $500 
million. with 80 percent covered 
by federal grants, leaving at least 
$100 million to be divided between 
the City, University, and other local 
jurisdictions.

“This 
is 
an 
important 

transportation project, and I would 
like to see it go forward, and I think 
2 percent is a number that we can live 
with,” Eaton said.

Mayor Christopher Taylor voiced 

opposition to the cut in the city’s 
commitment and voted against the 
amendment, arguing the city stands 
to benefit significantly from the 
project and should not reduce its role.

“I’m not inclined to support this 

effort,” Taylor said. “The University 
is taking the lead to finance the 
Connector, as it must, but the 
Connector will be a tremendous 
benefit to quality of life in Ann Arbor. 
We need to do our part.”

Presumptive 

nominee will focus 

on student loans, 

high tuition rates

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

Candidates seeking to capitalize 

on historic rates of student turnout 
in this year’s presidential race are 
taking public stances on student 
debt and higher education funding 
and accessibility.

Democrats addressed education 

policy upon announcement of the 
current front-runners’ campaigns. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (D–Vermont) 
campaign 
centers 
around 

education, 
particularly 
tuition-

free public universities, as a key 
issue in his bid for the Democratic 
nomination. Sanders’ opponent, 
former Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton, accordingly debuted a 
wide-reaching plan called the New 
College Compact, which aims to 
create debt-free college, also calling 
specific attention to the issue of 
sexual assault on college campuses.

Businessman Donald Trump, 

the freshly minted presumptive 
Republican nominee, had yet to 
focus on his appeal to college 
students prior to his competitors’ 
dropping out of the race for the 
party’s nomination. While Trump 
has yet to announce a cohesive 
platform on his campaign site, 
he has become more vocal on the 
issue.

Democrats

Both Sanders and Clinton made 

education reform central to their 
campaigns, but approached policy 
changes differently.

Sanders focuses on ensuring 

all students can attend public 
universities and colleges for free, 
boasting a history of attempts to 
tackle the rising cost of attending 
college. 
Last 
May, 
Sanders 

introduced the College for All Act 
on the Senate floor, which aimed 
to allocate $47 billion each year 
toward paying off undergraduate 

students’ tuition and fees at public 
institutions.

Sanders’s 
current 
platform 

goes beyond free tuition to cut 
student loan interest rates down 
to 2.32 percent. The senator also 
calls for an expansion of need-
based financial aid and work-study 
programs to assist college students, 
all of which is estimated to cost $74 
billion per year. Sanders claimed he 
would finance this hefty budget by 
taxing Wall Street speculators.

In a March interview with the 

Daily, LSA junior Nicholas Kolenda, 
president of the University of 
Michigan’s Students for Sanders, 
said Sanders’s plan is inclusive of 
the entire population.

“It’s a slippery slope when you 

exclude people from public goods 
because they can’t pay for it,” 
Kolenda said. “We don’t exclude 
the top one percent from public 
growth because they can privately 
pay for college.”

Clinton, on the other hand, 

does not plan to make college 
entirely free. Her New College 
Compact plan solely targets the 
exponential rise of college debt, 
tasking universities with taking 
responsibility for their tuition 
levels.

Cynthia 
Wilbanks, 
vice 

president 
for 
government 

relations at the University, said 
the University is similarly working 
more closely with students in 
response to candidates’ demands to 
hold universities more accountable 
for tuition levels.

“The most important thing is 

that we have receptive students 
and families,” she said. “One of 
the ways we have been called to 
be more helpful is spending more 
time with what it is students are 
expected to do in terms of financial 
aid.”

LSA junior Anushka Sarkar, 

outreach 
director 
and 
event 

coordinator 
for 
Students 
for 

Hillary, said Clinton’s plan is far 
more attainable than the one 
proposed by Sanders. Clinton aims 
to lower debt, but also require 
families to make an affordable and 
realistic family contribution to the

A more inclusive education

Invest in friends

FROM THE DAILY

In response to the Board of 

Education’s guidelines, Michigan 
state Sen. Tom Casperson (R–
Escanaba) announced his plans for 
a bill that requires students to use 
bathrooms and locker rooms that 
correspond with their “birth” sex. 
If the student has written consent 
from a parent or guardian, he or 
she may use an alternative single-
occupancy restroom or a staff 
member’s bathroom, according 
to Casperson’s proposed bill. This 
has stunted the progress to get 
the State Board of Education’s 
protective 
and 
inclusive 

guidelines 
for 
transgender 

students formalized, even after 
a public comment period ended 
last week. Such a maneuver is an 
obstacle to Michigan’s inclusivity, 
and we stand opposed to all 
actions taken to obstruct these 
inclusive guidelines’ approval.

While the nation may currently 

be obsessed with a debate over 
restrooms, 
these 
guidelines 

barely discuss them. Most of 
the 
document 
is 
dedicated 

to 
suggestions 
for 
improving 

transgender inclusivity through 

recommendations 
concerning 

names, pronouns, sports and 
dress codes in Michigan public 
schools. Near the end, in a small 
section titled “Restrooms,” the 
State Board of Education provides 
two 
alternative 
options 
for 

resolving the “bathroom” conflict. 
The 
guidelines 
essentially 

state that, in an ideal scenario, 
students should be allowed to use 
a restroom that corresponds to 
their gender identity — regardless 
of whether or not it corresponds 
with 
what’s 
on 
their 
birth 

certificate —, and, if the student 
requests, they can gain access to 
a gender neutral restroom or staff 
member’s restroom. 

The 
paragraph 
for 
“Locker 

Rooms or Changing Facilities,” 
however, does not recommend for 
full inclusivity in locker rooms. 
Instead, the guidelines recommend 
the 
student 
use 
an 
adjusted 

changing schedule or a private area 
(in the facility or nearby). These 
kinds of alternatives may result 
in the student feeling stigmatized 
and 
excluded. 
Such 
was 
the 

case in Illinois, where the U.S. 

Department of Education’s Office 
of Civil Rights ruled that Chicago’s 
Township High School District 
211 violated a a transgender teen’s 
rights in requiring her to use a 
separate designated area instead of 
the girls’ locker room.

Beyond 
 
the 
isolation 
of 

transgender students is another 
problematic aspect of the State 
Board of Education’s guidelines: 
the recommendation of discretion 
in locker room usage “determined 
on 
a 
case-by-case 
basis.” 

Claiming that these decisions on 
inclusivity are subject to a case-
by-case discretion gives cover for 
discriminatory, bigoted policy that 
doesn’t have the interest of affected 
students at heart.

Furthermore, while the current 

political environment may be toxic 
to radical change, we hope that one 
day the state will turn the State 
Board of Education’s proposed 
guidelines 
for 
transgender 

inclusivity into truly enforceable 
action. Only then will we have a 
positive learning environment for 
all LGBTQ students of all ages in 
our state. 

Two months ago, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed a bill banning 
transgender individuals from using public bathrooms that don’t match 
the sex on their birth certificates. The bill resulted in numerous protests 
and lawsuits. Even before this discussion re-entered the national 
discourse, the Michigan State Board of Education was considering 
providing schools with formal but non-binding guidelines for a safe 
and supportive learning environment for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, 
Transgender and Questioning (LGBTQ) students. These guidelines 
suggest that schools allow students to choose their own gender, name, 
pronouns and bathrooms without the input of parents, doctors or the 
school. The Board of Education’s guidelines call for equal treatment 
for transgender students while suggesting that only the student can 
determine their gender identity.

O

ut of all of the pressures 
placed on us in college, the 
pressure to have a broad 

social circle and 
loyal 
friends 

may be the most 
confusing. The 
pressure to get a 
good grade can be solved by studying, 
the pressure to feel involved can be 
solved by joining organizations on 
campus, but the pressure to make 
deep and meaningful connections 
with other people doesn’t have 
an easy solution. Social media, 
where people often flaunt their 
friendships by posting group photos 
and commenting on each other’s 
statuses, only works to exacerbate 
this pressure. In some cases, people 
can put their time and effort into an 
organization on campus and thus 
make friends, but it doesn’t always 
work out this way for everyone. We 
are constantly surrounded by people 
our own age, with similar interests 
and similar schedules — so why is 
it so hard for some of us to make 
friends and form a social group?

In high school, friendships were 

easier to make and sustain. For the 
most part, we saw the same people 
multiple times each day, and due to 
high school’s rigid social structure, 
it was fairly easy to tell whom our 
circle of friends were. At least this 
was how it worked in my case 
— I attended a school where my 
graduating class was 90 people, most 
of whom I had known since middle 
school. I remember that before 
coming to college, a lot of authority 
figures told me that at a university, I 
could decide whom my “real” friends 
were, that they would no longer be 
based on convenience. And for the 
most part this has been true; I have 
been able to make a lot of new friends 
at the University of Michigan, the 
foundations of these friendships 
based on more than accessibility. So, 
in my experience, meeting potential 
friends hasn’t been the issue here at 
the University, it has been finding 
ways to sustain these friendships.

Let me tell you a little bit more 

about myself. I had a very close friend 
throughout childhood whom I had a 
falling-out with, and I believe that the 
source of this falling-out was because 
one of us decided to switch schools 
and neither of us were very good at 
keeping up with communication. 
Recently, I tried to reconnect, but 
she essentially told me that she 
wasn’t interested in any chance at 
reconciliation. After hearing this, I 
felt I was incapable of maintaining 
a friendship. This was especially 

daunting to realize as I am planning 
to spend the next full academic year 
abroad in China. I was worried that 
the friendships that I had made at 
college would go the same way as 
my childhood friendships — that we 
would stop talking and that the end 
of our friendships would be clouded 
in confusion and anger. I desperately 
wanted to keep these friendships — 
friendships that, though not based on 
convenience, are easily maintained 
because we all live in the same city 
and have similar schedules. I wasn’t 
sure how I was going to keep this 
interaction up while I was thousands 
of miles away and in a different time 
zone.

I’m still figuring it out. I haven’t 

left for China yet, so I still have time 
to come up with a plan of action 
for how I am going to sustain my 
friendships. But recently I’ve found 
that trying harder is a good place to 
start. The friends that I have that 
don’t live in my dorm, I’ve tried to 
learn their schedules and invite them 
to hang out more. I try to leave the 
comfort of my dorm more often so 
that I can visit my friends who don’t 
live in the same building as me. I try 
to be the first to initiate contact with 
somebody whom I think I could 
become friends with — something I 
never did in high school. I’ve started 
to value myself as a friend — I try 
to see myself as a person that other 
people would want to be associated 
with, 
which 
makes 
me 
more 

confident when trying to establish 
connections. And, most importantly, 
I’ve decided to focus mainly on my 
individual friendships and not on the 
group dynamic. It can be exhausting 
making sure that all of your friends 
are also friends with each other and 
ensuring that your circle of friends is 
in good shape.

When it comes down to it, I’ve 

found that perfect friendships aren’t 
really something that exist. Though 
it may seem that everybody around 
you has the perfect squad, I bet that 
upon closer inspection, things aren’t 
as impeccable as you would think. I 
think that the most important part of 
making good friends in college is to 
take care of yourself — get rid of the 
friends that drain you, and hold on to 
the friends that lift you up. As we all 
have learned by now, there is no part 
of our lives that will ever be perfect — 
so why should we expect our friend 
groups to be perfect? All we can do 
is protect ourselves and be kind to 
those who have been kind to us.

LAUREN INGRAM | MICHIGAN IN COLOR

Dear Mainstream,
You have seen my thighs dangle 

out from under my shorts and my 
skirts. They jiggle, they flap and cause 
problems whenever I try on something 
new. It’s a little difficult to learn how to 
love every inch of my body fat when I go 
into a store — take your pick, H&M or 
Forever 21 — and have difficulty buying 
shorts. All of a sudden my regularly 
size six thighs can’t fit into your size 
10 shorts. That’s a problem. Oh, my 
beautiful thick thighs — I put so much 
onto you that it always leaves behind 
lines and marks from the jeans I 
force onto you each day. Mainstream, 
I love my rolls, the rolls that roll over 
my size six pants — but do you? Why 
don’t you see the beauty behind my 
curves and my rolls? I never see my 
reflection on any of those websites 
when I’m shopping online. I’ve 
rarely met someone who looks like 
those size small, 5’10” models, with 
a small bust and a small waist. You 
deceive us, making us think those 
clothes will fit just like they do on the 
models, but they don’t. Are they ever 
tried on by someone who was larger 
than a small? You imagine all of us to 
be the same, and you expect for us to 
change until we are. Mainstream, you 
don’t allow for individuality, and you’re 
so quick to deem someone’s body out 
of the norm, to be plus-sized. Why is 
plus size a different section in general? 
You choose every chance you get to 
embarrass my big black thighs, forcing 
me to go to the plus size section when 
you can easily extend the sizes into 
your regular lines. Mainstream, learn 
to love and accept my body for what 
it is. What you see as imperfections I 
see as uniqueness.

Mainstream, you have taken away 

my uniqueness by manipulating my 
nanas, aunties and mommas for years. 
For so long, I was told that I had to tame 
my hair and make it look “presentable,” 
all the while damaging my hair. My 
hair, oh my hair, it’s been pinched 
and bobbled, robbed of its texture 
and all. It’s been strained, lost, 
shortened and almost completely 
uprooted. For years, my hair follicles 
have endured chemically-induced 
pain. Sitting there for what feels like 

years, being permed and burned, 
permed and burned, permed and 
burned. I constantly complainied 
from the pain only to be reminded 
that “beauty is pain.” Why does 
it have to hurt to be beautiful? 
Mainstream, you’re the one who told 
our mommas to scold us in the morning 
if we didn’t wrap our hair the night 
before, always making sure that our 
hair would be neat. We’ve been placed 
in a bubble where we would rather 
spend the money to look good than 
spend the time to be true to ourselves. 
Mainstream, you are a catalyst for 
change — to make everyone look just 
like you. You have beaten into the heads 
of my nanas, aunties and mommas that 
the natural curl coming straight from 
my scalp shouldn’t be there. You have 
convinced many of them that the 
hair we are blessed with is not okay, 
forcing us to assimilate to straight 
long hair just so we are not looked at 
as beneath the rest of mainstream. 
How I choose to wear my hair is my 
prerogative. I want to see my natural 
curls back. I want to walk into a job 
interview with the curls that sprout 
from my head and not worry about 
whether or not my qualifications are 
the only thing in consideration for 
the job. I’m slowly having to prove to 
those who come before me that it’s 
okay to wear my hair in its natural 
state. Mainstream, accept me and my 
natural afro of curls, just like we’ve 
had to accept everything else that 
you’ve thrashed in our faces.

Accept my skin, embrace it — it’s 

not going anywhere. I am born and 
proud of my smooth cocoa skin — my 
beautiful chocolate skin that reminds 
you of filth, that you describe as 
dirt. Mainstream, you set aside my 
skin color as if it’s removable. We 
are not seen as an entity that needs 
representation. You were in my 
friend’s head when she thought her 
only option was to bleach her beautiful 
skin — her beautiful chocolate brown 
skin. Mainstream, you tell my sisters 
and me that we will be accepted if we 
look just like you, if we try to match 
you as best we can. There’s a divide 
between me and my lighter-skinned 
sisters. Mainstream, do you only 

wish to inflict pain on me and my 
sisters? Do you know how difficult 
it is to look in the mirror and never 
see the image reflected back at you 
in media? Mainstream, do you hear 
from your nanas, aunties and mommas 
that you need to date someone with 
lighter skin so that your babies will 
have lighter skin so that your baby will 
be considered beautiful based upon her 
skin color? Mainstream, if you could 
change your skin color, would you be 
chocolate? No. You would rather 
just take everything else about black 
women and claim it as your own.

My lips, oh my lips, I was born 

with these luscious, full and round 
lips. They were not manufactured 
— just au natural. You constantly 
tore down my sisters for their lips 
and used it as a way to emasculate 
my brothers. “Big lips” are equated 
with ugliness, mainstream, except 
when it comes to today’s reality stars. 
We embrace many reality stars as if 
their newfound interest in having 
big lips make them look better when 
that same amount of tissue in my lips 
is deemed unattractive. These are the 
same lips I use to mindfully obey your 
every whim, policing my sisters about 
their hair expression and reminding 
our brothers that assimilation is the 
only way to get ahead — all of that to 
finally have my lips deemed “cool.” My 
grandmother actually tried to teach 
me ways to make my lips look smaller 
based on the type of makeup that I 
used.

There’s only so much about my 

appearance and my body that I can 
continue to take from you, so I’ve 
decided to take it all back. No longer 
will I look to you for justification. If 
you will not represent my beautiful 
body and everything that comes 
along with it, then I’ll find or create 
a space that will. If you refuse to 
recognize the part of your current 
culture that takes parts of the 
culture that I’ve had for years, I will 
shame you for it. Mainstream, if you 
continue to purposely tear me and 
my sisters down, remember that 
we’ll always keep rising up.

Sincerely,
The Conventional Black Girl

Science needs storytellers
I 

read an article recently in The New 
Yorker written by the physician-
scientist Siddhartha Mukherjee, 

which introduces 
the 
topic 
of 

epigenetics 
through 
stories 

about his mother 
and aunt. They’re identical twins, 
but Mukherjee remarks on how their 
personalities 
differ 
despite 
their 

genetic similarity, which he alludes to 
in the title, “Same But Different.” He 
attributes their distinctive qualities 
to another layer of biological data 
encoded over the DNA in each cell of 
the body. The epigenome, he says, is a 
system composed of proteins and other 
small molecules that interact with 
DNA, controlling how it is read, which, 
in part, defines individuality.

It was a welcome example of how 

employing a personal narrative can 
be used to explain an area of science 
by bringing it to life, enabling a casual 
reader to absorb the information 
comfortably. Epigenetics and other 
areas of science might otherwise seem 
intimidating or dry if encountered 
through a textbook or peer-reviewed 
article. It’s enjoyable to leisurely read 
and learn about an unfamiliar subject, 
but also interesting to observe how 
a familiar subject is presented to 
somebody else in an unfamiliar way. 
In this case, however, biology experts 
reading Mukherjee’s explanation of 
epigenetics reacted differently.

The 
article 
quickly 
received 

widespread criticism for providing 
an incomplete explanation about the 
mechanisms of gene regulation. An 
article in the scientific journal Nature 
noted that one genetics researcher said 
the article was “a horribly damaging 
piece” for the field. Another called it 
“a truly painful read.” Researchers 
believed 
some 
of 
Mukherjee’s 

descriptions were inaccurate and noted 
that he failed to include any mention 
of transcription factors (a completely 
different group of molecules that affect 
how DNA is read), misleading the 
public about the true inner-workings 
of gene expression. Naturally, a more 
objective explanation of the science 
would have left little print room for his 
personal narrative, which may not have 
appealed as much to the magazine’s 
non-science-specific 
readership. 

Mukherjee himself has acknowledged 
his article’s shortcomings, but The 
New Yorker has defended the content.

This controversy highlights an 

important 
discussion 
about 
the 

communication of science. Because 
science, 
especially 
biology, 
can 

be so complex, anyone actually 
working in the field must have a deep 

understanding of where the boundary 
of knowledge exists in order to ask 
the right questions and to obtain the 
answers that extend that boundary. A 
researcher might spend years trying 
to understand the mechanism of a 
new cell-signaling pathway, when 
thousands of different pathways are 
already confirmed to exist, and many 
more remain undiscovered. There 
arises a substantial gap between the 
depth of what scientists believe to 
be true or possible, and what the lay-
public has the capacity to understand.

Mukherjee 
exhibits 
how 

storytelling is an important method 
for communicating science. Using 
personal anecdotes and explaining 
concepts at a surface level is effective 
in enabling a lay-audience to relate 
and understand. Inevitably, many 
mainstream media outlets will fail 
to present scientific topics with 
thoroughness 
and 
depth 
when 

constraints, such as word count or air 
time, exist. In these cases, it should be 
acknowledged by journalists, who can 
direct someone with a deeper interest 
to sources where they can learn more.

But sometimes science can be 

packaged so artificially for the media 
that the message presented hardly 
resembles the conclusion of the 
original study. In a recent episode of his 
show “Last Week Tonight,” comedy 
news anchor John Oliver bashed 
media outlets like Time magazine, 
“The 
Today 
Show,” 
local 
news 

broadcasts and even the TED series for 
sometimes overlooking the diligence 
and nuances of scientific studies in 
order to hook the viewer with a catchy 
headline. (In one instance, a study 
testing the effects of eating chocolate 
on childbearing, which turned out to 
show no effect, somehow received the 
local news headline: “Eating moderate 
amounts of chocolate could benefit 
mom and baby.”) While attention-
grabbing headlines are important for 
sequestering viewers and readers, 
journalists 
should 
ensure 
more 

consistency from what the study 
concludes to what the reader or viewer 
sees by interviewing the researchers 
themselves, instead of merely trying to 
interpret conclusions in press releases.

Keeping 
scientific 
news 
and 

discussion in the mainstream media 
is vital to the dissemination of new 
knowledge. In addition to accuracy, 
reach 
is 
also 
important. 
Those 

believing that dry, comprehensive 
accounts are the only tools for 
distributing new findings will be 
greatly disappointed in their lack 
of permeation among the general 
public, when people cannot connect 
to the concepts. A more scientifically 

DAVID 
MERTZ

informed public generates new ideas 
for solving problems and better policies. 
The scientific community should 
appreciate journalism that creatively 
shares new findings and, instead of 
quickly antagonizing its messengers, 
should request for findings to be 
communicated accurately with the 
proper context and implications.

In 
“Same 
But 
Different,” 

Mukherjee chooses to prioritize 
telling a story to explain epigenetics 
instead of purely objectifying the 
subject matter and diluting the 
element of humanity he uses to 
connect with his audience. His 
new book “The Gene: An Intimate 
History” becomes available May 17. It 

will include other narratives and fill 
the scientific holes left by his article, 
providing a more comprehensive, 
yet still accessible, understanding 
of gene regulation. Hopefully it will 
appease his critics.

MUSIC REVIEW

‘Scandal’ hype 
slowly derailing

By ALEX INTNER

Summer Managing Arts Editor

During the season five episode 

of “Scandal” titled “Thwack,” the 
story seemed to be zipping along. 
Then, 
with 
a 

“Thwack,” 
all 

momentum 
completely 
collapsed. Olivia 
Pope 
(Kerry 

Washington, 
“Django 
Unchained”), 
who has been 
held up as a white hat for justice 
(despite some dark marks on her 
name), murders the former Vice 
President of the United States. 
The episode revisits a point of 
huge emotional turmoil in Olivia’s 
kidnapping and was actually doing 
quite well up until the “Thwack,” 
but it changes her character in a 
completely unnecessary manner.

This episode is representative 

of the fifth season of “Scandal” 
as a whole. Every time the drama 
seemed to be taking a step forward 
in both regaining narrative focus 
and creating a compelling story, it 
took two back. For every episode 
focusing on a presidential debate, 
there was one pulling the show 
deeper into the B-613 hole. It’s 
frustrating 
because 
there 
are 

points at which the series puts out a 
moment, sometimes a fleeting one, 
which reminds me of why I loved it 
in the past, but those are starting to 
become fewer and farther between.

Many of “Scandal” ’s problems 

seem to revolve around one key 
group of characters, and the finale 
doubles down on keeping them 
around as key parts of the show. One 
of the major conflicts was an inane 
story involving Jake Ballard (Scott 
Foley, “The Unit”) trying to get 
Olivia to save him from her father, 
Rowan (Joe Morton, “Eureka”). It 
ends up not with an Olivia win, but 
rather with Rowan getting what 
he wanted all along: Ballard on the 
Republican ticket alongside Mellie 
Grant (Bellamy Young, “Criminal 
Minds”).

I’m tired of B-613 as both a group 

of characters and a plot device. The 
series uses it to artificially inflate 
the drama, but I can only listen to 
so many monologues from Rowan 

about how he’s not only doing this 
for his own power, but rather for the 
the people he cares about. There’s 
only so many times I can see Rowan 
commit some horrible act to gain 
power. There’s only so many times I 
can see Olivia lose to these people. 
The show views these characters as 
viable antagonists, but it’s repeating 
the same devices over and over 
again until they lose their impact.

Though Rowan and Jake were 

involved 
the 
whole 
way, 
the 

election storyline was a glimmer 
of hope among the B-613 bullshit. 
The Republican battle between 
Mellie and Vice President Susan 
Ross (Artemis Pebdani, “Another 
Period”) 
made 
for 
compelling 

television. The plot twisted and 
turned in a traditional “Scandal” 
manner, as the characters plotted 
to win their ideal candidates the 
nomination. The campaigns fought 
bitterly, stabbing each other in 
the back and digging up dirt on 
each other, and the ups and downs 
of their candidacies were highly 
entertaining.

What especially made the fight 

engrossing was how it tested the 
relationship between Olivia and 
Abby (Darby Stanchfield, “Mad 
Men”) by pitting them against one 
another. Their friendship has always 
been a powerful core of the show. 
Olivia has always been a mentor 
to Abby, so to see them battle, 
and to see Abby betray Olivia by 
thinking about using Liv’s abortion 
against her and accidentally telling 
President Fitzgerald Grant (Tony 
Goldwyn, “Tarzan”) about it, pained 
my heart. It brought a new level to 
the relationship, and, in a season 
in which the series used quite a bit 
of repetitive storytelling, it made a 
huge difference.

All “Scandal”’s problems are a 

damn shame, because there’s still 
a great show somewhere in there. 
Shonda Rhimes (“Grey’s Anatomy”) 
and crew have driven themselves 
too far into the weeds. The finale 
pushed further into the depths of 
this terrible storyline, which doesn’t 
leave much hope that it can course-
correct and save itself. Maybe 
there’s a glimmer in the next season 
only being 16 episodes, instead of 
22 (requiring tighter storytelling), 
but unless they dump B-613, the 
potential could easily be lost.

‘Pool’ a graceful release

Radiohead brings 
a much-welcome 
maturity to “Pool”

By ANAY KATYAL

Summer Senior Arts Editor

Radiohead has a long history of 

its releases containing a rare level 
of profundity. And in their thirty-
some year exis-
tence, 
their 

staying power 
is only a testa-
ment to their 
continued 
lyrical and cre-
ative 
solidity. 

With A Moon 
Shaped Pool, it 
was hard for 
fans to know what to expect — 
the band’s illustrious discography 
has commented on arguably every 
major aspect of life and society 
one could imagine. But in their 
ninth release thus far, Radiohead 
exchanges continued social com-
mentary for material only tell-
ing of their everlasting ability to 
work both listener’s minds and 
ears. Contained within A Moon 
Shaped Pool is a kind of wisdom 
that can only be afforded to a band 
whose content and thoughts have 
garnered 
continued 
relevancy 

decades after its release, provid-
ing listeners with an exploration 
of their emotions, thoughts and 
ideals. The band has always flirted 
with experimentation, but, in Pool, 
Radiohead brings a change of con-
tent that serves as the perfect hom-
age both to the kind of material 
they’ve put out and the reputation 
it has cemented for them. It’s an 
enlightening level of maturity from 
a band already lauded for its astute 
body of work.

Much of Pool’s material has 

either been leaked in some form or 
teased by the band at various con-
certs over the past two decades. 
In the album’s opener, “Burn the 
Witch,” the band crafts a time-
less, but pointed, political mes-
sage, using the imagery of a lynch 
mob to frame the song’s message 
as a critique of the devolvement of 
Western society’s social discourse. 
Though recordings of the song have 
floated around for a little over a 
decade now, the song is as apt with 
today’s controversies over trans-
gender bathroom use and institu-

tionalized xenophobia as it is with 
the kind social issues that plagued 
society at the cusp of the new mil-
lennium. The string arrangements 
and subtle use of electronica (a 
contrast from Radiohead’s last few 
releases) bring to life the kind of 
melancholy engendered by those 
very social issues before descend-
ing into sounds of feral anger, illus-
trative of the state of the modern 
West’s political scene.

If Radiohead’s last few releases 

have been outward critiques of the 
various ill components of society, 
Pool is an exploration of the emo-
tions and feelings tied to those 
components. Rather than continu-
ing to criticize from the stands, the 
band has taken the opportunity to 
introspect on their longstanding 
thoughts and feelings, exchang-
ing lyrics with linear meaning 
for layered instrumentation that 
expresses their emotions better 
than any words could. Expansive 
and diverse in content, the album 
permeates with a divergent sound. 
“Ful Stop” and its vengeful synth 
descend into a palpable madness, 
juxtaposed with Thom Yorke’s sig-
nature moans and the band’s token 
interlacing guitar rhythms; “Tin-
ker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man 
Poor Man Beggar Man Thief,” in 
all its reverberating glory, strad-
dles the line between acoustic and 
electronic sound, creating a rich 
sound bursting with wry feelings 
of dread and sadness. The instru-
ments throb, the lyrics wail and 
the listener unwittingly embraces 
sounds wrought with deep-seated 
emotion.

Closing the album is a much 

storied (and sought after) piece by 
Radiohead — crude concert record-
ings of “True Love Waits” have 
been floating around the internet 
for around two decades now, and 
the lack of an official studio release 
(bar its appearance on their 2001 
live album I Might Be Wrong) was 
met with the constant chagrin of 
Radiohead’s most loyal patrons 
(and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t 
among those complaining). The 
album’s version is bare-boned and 
raw, with nothing but a piano back-
ing Yorke’s croons. “I’m not living, 
I’m just killing time,” Yorke sings in 
a rather personal and transparent 
display of his psyche. Though the 
rich guitar and emotional depth in 
Yorke’s singing on past versions are 
still sorely missed relative to Pool’s 
spin on the track, the revealing 

humanity of “True Love Waits” is 
still a welcome addition to the bar-
rage of emotional fervor contained 
within A Moon Shaped Pool.

While Radiohead’s discography 

has a set of established fan 
favorites (ask a few Radiohead fans 
what their favorite songs are and 
you’ll probably find an amusing 
pattern), few underpin the band’s 
thematic approach as much as OK 
Computer’s “The Tourist.” Though 
its importance doesn’t really lie 
in its relative musical excellence 
(with plenty of other masterful 
songs it has to rub shoulders 
against on OK Computer alone), it’s 
a song emblematic of a philosophy 
that’s remained a constant in 
Radiohead’s work. With Jonny 
Greenwood’s 
shoegazey 
guitar 

anchoring the song and Yorke 
crooning lyrics like “Hey man, 
slow down, slow down / Idiot, slow 
down,” the song begs people to take 
a step back and savor what’s around 
them. Considering that, to judge a 
Radiohead record so closely after 
its release is a fairly futile task. 
With their penchant for layered 
lyrics and imagery that takes even 
the keenest of fans months (or 
even years) to fully comprehend, 
drawing an immediate appraisal 
out of thin air for a band like 
Radiohead, especially in today’s 
world of throw-away consumption, 
is a big ask. Even in my pre-
adolescent years, listening to In 
Rainbows thirty-some times in 
a row (while also wallowing in 
my budding angst) was the only 
way I could draw a conclusion as 
to what made the album so great. 
Considering that A Moon Shaped 
Pool is effectively the band’s most 
pointed, thoughtful and mature 
work to date, enjoying it like any 
other mainstream record out today 
would be doing both the band and 
its album a disservice. In their 
effort to erase themselves from 
the internet and tease the album’s 
release with a more orchestral 
single than what fans are used to, 
Radiohead harkens back to simpler 
days, separating any potential 
distractions from their work and 
boiling down their art to a rather 
bare, humble form — the strongest 
echo of the band’s undying credo 
to date. With its lyrical focus and 
messages of social and emotional 
consciousness, what’s the use of A 
Moon Shaped Pool if we can’t slow 
down a bit and embrace it for what 
it’s for?

‘Grace and Frankie’ is a 
breath of fresh air on TV

TV REVIEW

“Grace and Frankie” 
shows improvement 
on its first season

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

The second season of “Grace 

and Frankie” began with wishes 
and ended with vibrators. To 
be more pre-
cise, it began 
with Frankie 
(Lily Tomlin, 
“Grandma”) 
making a wish 
on 
an 
eye-

lash and then 
yanking a hair 
from 
Grace’s 

(Jane 
Fonda, 

“Youth) chin and making Grace 
wish on it, and it ended with 
them deciding to make a busi-
ness out of sex toys for women 
with arthritis (while also saying 
goodbye to a dear friend). It was a 
tightly written season, wrapping 
up almost all loose ends while 
still leaving a few tantalizing 
ideas for future seasons.

In the first episode of the 

second season, Robert (Martin 
Sheen, “The West Wing”) has a 
heart attack and ends up in the 
hospital. Before he goes into 
surgery, he decides he wants 
to marry Sol (Sam Waterson, 
“The Newsroom”) in the hospi-
tal, just in case. It’s up to Grace 
and Frankie to find a minister 
for the wedding of their two ex-
husbands — and thus, the first 
episode of hilarity ensues. First 
they find a Catholic priest who 
won’t marry gays; then they find 
a rabbi who has no problem with 
two men getting married, but he 
won’t officiate a wedding that’s 
not between two Jewish people. 
Grace, fed up with this non-
sense, finally shouts: “There’s a 
sick WASP upstairs who needs to 
marry the Jewish one!” Eventu-
ally, Frankie officiates the wed-
ding, beginning with “We are 
here today to join my ex-husband 
with her ex-husband.”

Throughout 
the 
episode, 

Frankie decides to sell her infa-
mous lube made with yams to 

Grace’s daughter Brianna (June 
Diane Raphael, “Burning Love”), 
who runs a cosmetics business. 
Frankie wants millions of dollars 
and her own vaginal art on the 
boxes and stubbornly holds on to 
several of her values regarding 
the business, making Brianna’s 
life extremely difficult. Grace 
goes on a journey to find an old 
flame, which doesn’t and then 
does work out.

One of the funniest parts of the 

fifth episode is a bit of a throw-
away conversation between Grace 
and Frankie. Grace, while talking 
to Frankie about her relationship 
with her old friends, refers to the 
“whole Robert mess” — mean-
ing, of course, the fact that Rob-
ert and Sol had been cheating 
on Grace and Frankie with each 
other for years — and Frankie 
asks her what she means by that. 
Grace looks incredulously at her 
and Frankie realizes what she 
means, but quickly tosses it away 
with a hand wave. This season 
builds on what the first season 
did by allowing room for the 
expression of the pain that comes 
from cheating but also makes us 
aware that the most important 
part of this show is the resilience 
of these two women, and their 
friendship.

“Grace and Frankie” deals 

with more than the negotiation of 
relationship politics between two 
families bizarrely twined togeth-
er. As the two main characters 
and their husbands are both of 
retirement age, everyone’s got 
mortality on the brain. One of 

Grace and Frankie’s eccentric 
friends throws herself the “party 
to end all parties” because she 
wants one final good time before 
she dies by choice before letting 
cancer get her first. The show 
portrays a positive stance on peo-
ple choosing how and when they 
want to go when their options 
are limited, injecting slivers of 
humor and hope into a conver-
sation that is otherwise bleak. 
The finale features a magnifi-
cent speech by both Grace and 
Frankie on how women their 
age aren’t respected or acknowl-
edged — especially sexually — so 
they decide to go into business 
together, making vibrators for 
women with arthritis.

The 
acting 
has 
only 

strengthened 
over 
time, 

bolstered by hysterical writing. 
The jokes land one right after the 
other; Tomlin and Fonda have 
unrivaled chemistry on screen 
(though it is still fun to watch 
Sheen and Waterson play lovers), 
which is part of the reason 
“Grace and Frankie” was able to 
make a significant demographic 
care about a show that revolves 
around 
two 
wealthy, 
white, 

older-than-middle aged women 
and their families. While it’s 
hard to ignore just how wealthy 
they are — especially every 
time there’s a beautiful shot 
of a meal at the beach house — 
and how their abilities to cope 
with their problems are aided 
by that, the show manages to 
ground itself in comedy that 
never lacks a heartfelt warmth.

“Is that yam lube all it’s cracked up to be?”

‘Monster’ bores

By RACHEL RICHARDSON

Daily Arts Writer

Perhaps the reason why kids 

have trouble believing there really 
are no monsters under their beds is 
that they can eas-
ily detect bullshit 
in the explana-
tions we provide 
them. 
“Money 

Monster” 
dem-

onstrates 
the 

extent to which 
members of the 
adult world allow 
themselves 
to 

accept the ques-
tionable excuses 
large corporations give them 
when they have a major screw up. 
However, there comes a point, like 
when a company loses eight bil-
lion dollars and proceeds to attri-
bute the mishap to a technological 
glitch, when everyone becomes 
suspicious and angry.

Now, “Money Monster” is not 

actually a nickname for the rather 
unthreatening 
antagonist, 
but 

rather it’s the title of Lee Gates’s 
(George Clooney, “Gravity”) tele-
vision show directed by Patty 
Fern (Julia Roberts, “Notting 
Hill”). Every Friday, Lee gives 
financial tips to the public that, 
while mostly accurate, are usually 
exaggerated. Thus, his fanbase is 
countered by a substantial group 
of haters. One of these haters, 
Kyle Budwell (Jack O’ Connell, 
“Unbroken”), sneaks onto the set 
determined to get an explanation 
for how IBIS (a powerful corpora-
tion) could possibly lose eight bil-
lion dollars overnight. He begins 
his interrogation by forcing Lee to 
make himself a human bomb. The 
only wrinkle in Kyle’s plan is that 
IBIS’s CEO, Walt Cannby (Domi-
nic West, “300”), who was previ-
ously scheduled to do an in-person 
interview that day, has suddenly 
gone rogue (coincidence? I think 
not). At first, Lee thinks Kyle is 
a disillusioned psychopath con-
vinced his life is far worse than 
anyone else’s. But, as Lee listens to 
Kyle’s testimony, he becomes con-
vinced the real culprit must have 
human, not virtual fingerprints.

Clooney 
adds 
an 
essential 

layer of depth to the typical 
bigoted millionaire TV show host 
persona. He demonstrates hosting 
is a craft that requires the ability 
to make a connection with people, 

which is something not many can 
do well. Furthermore, Clooney 
shows hosts are frequently actors 
themselves — the attitude they 
exhibit for the camera may not 
be an accurate representation 
of their true personality. On air, 
Lee’s a know-it-all who views 
women as nothing more than 
sexualized objects. Yet, off screen, 
he exudes sincere gratitude for his 
entire crew, especially Patty. 

Roberts’ portrayal of her char-

acter assures us Patty deserves 
this recognition. Patty comes 
off as a trustworthy, intelligent 
woman who can remain calm dur-
ing high risk situations. On the 
other hand, she’s also not afraid 
to be annoyingly persistent and 
yell at high powered executives 
when they offer her nothing more 
than fabricated excuses. Finally, 
she’s a triumphant representative 
of women in power — not once 
do we question her ability to lead 
the crew of at least 30 individuals, 
most of whom are male. 

“Money Monster” pales in 

comparison to the films of both 
genres it tries to blend. Unlike 
crime thrillers such as “Now You 
See Me” that leave viewers guess-
ing until the final scene, “Money 
Monster” ’s events play out in a 
predictable manner. And, though 
it does expose the corruption of 
wealthy institutions, it fails to 
arouse the same intense feelings 
of hatred toward those who mis-
handle our hard-earned money 
that “The Big Short” does. Despite 
this, the film is not entirely dis-
tasteful, thanks to the comic relief 
provided by the loyal cameraman, 
Lenny (Lenny Venito, “War of the 
Worlds”), and the producer, Rob 
(Christopher Denham, “Shutter 
Island”).

Instead of smoothly shifting 

from one tone to the next, the film 
abruptly switches between them. 
While music usually helps to ease 
this type of transition, direc-
tor Jodie Foster’s (“The Silence 
of the Lambs”) use of music only 
enhances the contradicting tones. 
She follows the awkwardly sappy 
ending with Dan the Automator’s 
hype hip-hop track, “What Make 
the World Go Round [MONEY!].”

So, when deciding where to 

throw your green this weekend, 
know that “Money Monster” is a 
very risky investment. If I were 
you, I’d take that eight dollars and 
spend it somewhere else.

specific microbial species might 
lead to more successful results. 
Fecal transplants deliver stool 
samples from healthy donors 
to ill patients to change the 
microbiome 
in 
the 
patient’s 

digestive 
tract, 
according 
to 

Johns 
Hopkins 
Medicine. 

Currently, this procedure is used 
to treat recurrent inflammation 
in the large intestine caused 
by a bacterial species called 
Clostridium difficile.

“This 
idea 
of 
giving 
a 

community of microbes, I think, 
makes a lot of sense when thinking 
about other applications,” Yong 
said. “One of the most successful 
attempts involve exactly that … 
(Fecal transplant) is quite like an 
ecosystem transplant.”

Gilbert 
emphasized 
the 

importance of microbiomes in 
a medical setting, saying that 
studying 
the 
microbiome 
in 

individual patients is necessary for 
precision medicine, in addition to 
studying the human genome.

“Why doesn’t genetics give us 

the whole answer?” Gilbert said. 
“Because we need the human 
genome … but we need microbial 
genome as well.”

Gilbert further discussed how 

manipulating the microbiome can 
be useful for treating and curing 
many human diseases, such as 
allergies. Gilbert discussed, for 
instance, Amish children, who 
grow up on farms and usually do 
not develop asthma or allergies 
due to their exposure to certain 
microbes during their youth. 

Gilbert also discussed other 

health issues such as obesity 
and cancer from a microbiome 
perspective, 
mentioning 
that 

changing the microbiome can be 
an approach to fight such health 
crises.

“We are now working very 

exclusively to find way to use 
the microbiome ... to make the 
immune system fight cancer,” 
Gilbert said. “There are many 
ways we can harbor microbiome 
therapies for treating diseases.”

LSA sophomore John Hartert 

said he attended the session 
and a couple of talks during the 
day because he is interested 
in microbial ecology. Hartert 
particularly found the ubiquitous 
and impactful nature of the 
microbiome interesting.

“I was really interested in 

how expansive the effects of the 
microbiome is,” Hartert said.

this 
argument, 
studies 
suggest 

transgender individuals are more 
likely to be at risk while using public 
restrooms than those around them.

Despite the anti transgender-

rights rhetoric employed by some 
Republican legislators in Lansing, 
the University of Michigan provides 
a variety of accommodations for 
transgender 
students, 
including 

gender-inclusive housing and gender-
inclusive bathroom facilities. Gender-
inclusive housing involves either 
a room with a private bathroom 
or a room in proximity to gender-
inclusive bathroom facilities. Nearly 
all residence halls offer some sort 
of gender-inclusive facility. Gender 
inclusive facilities are open to all 
students who wish to use a private 
bathroom.

Kaufman said she was previously 

not permitted to use the women’s 
restroom facilities at the University, 
and often had to travel inconvenient 
distances to find gender-neutral 
facilities. However, the University 
has since changed that policy, 
and Kaufman said she no longer 
encounters the same restrictions.

Kaufman added that she has not 

had issues with the University’s 
policies in general, but that she 
believes the administration could 
go further in actively protecting 
transgender students rights.

“The University is one of the most 

liberal institutions in the country, so 
there aren’t really any problematic 
regulations that I’m aware of that 
exist anymore,” she said. “There’s 
more things that could be done to 
protect LGBT, particularly trans 
people, that the University could be 
doing.”

The University also offers a 

preferred name policy, which allows 

all students to change the name they 
wish to appear in the University 
directory. In April, Wolverines for 
Preferred Pronouns started a petition 
to 
additionally 
allow 
students’ 

preferred pronouns to appear on 
class rosters. As of Wednesday, the 
online petition has 788 signatures.

Kaufman said the University 

community 
has 
generally 
been 

welcoming to her, but she considers 
herself 
cis-passing 
— 
meaning, 

despite 
being 
a 
transgender 

woman, she appears to be a non-
transgender woman — which she 
believes contributes to the absence of 
harassment that many transgender 
individuals encounter.

“Generally, the reactions I’ve 

received have been very positive, 
but the circles I’m in are very liberal 
and accepting,” she said. “Now 
when I interact with people they 
don’t know that I’m trans a lot of 
the time, so I don’t really deal with 
that transphobia. It’s a unique thing 
because of the way I’m perceived by 
people. I don’t deal with a lot of the 
issues that trans women deal with.”

Despite 
the 
positive 
campus 

community, Kaufman cited instances 
of harassment on her social media 
accounts, saying she has drawn 
hostile online attention due to her 
visible activism. She said she also 
received a plethora of negative 
reactions 
from 
people 
walking 

past her as she participated in a 
demonstration where she held a sign 
identifying herself as a transgender 
woman.

Kaufman additionally referenced 

a need for normalizing transgender 
participation in sororities to help 
support the idea that transgender 
women are just like other women. 
Kaufman said she attempted to rush 
at the University, but she did not 
receive any bids.

Ann Arbor Public Schools
Locally, 
Ann 
Arbor 
Public 

Schools has been working for years 
to ensure a safe environment for its 
transgender 
students. 
According 

to Deb Mexicotte, president of the 
Ann Arbor Public Schools Board, the 
protection of students is based off of 
its own non-discrimination policy, 
which aims to protect all students 
from any form of discrimination.

Mexicotte 
said 
there 
is 

no 
specific 
policy 
directed 
at 

protecting 
transgender 
students, 

and the implementation of the 
non-discrimination 
policy 
varies 

from school to school. However, 
during Mexicotte’s tenure on the 
board, there have been no issues or 
complaints regarding the safety of 
transgender students that have come 
to her attention.

Mexicotte said she is proud of the 

work the district has done to ensure a 
positive learning environment for all 
students.

“One of the things I’m proud of in 

our community is that we try to do 
the right thing for our students, our 
staff and our community without 
being mandated to do so,” she said. 
“We are very cognizant of our role 
in creating that safe and welcoming 
educational environment.”

Mexicotte also indicated that any 

federal ordinance is always helpful 
in implementing policy and ensuring 
student protection, but that it’s yet 
to be determined whether or not the 
recent announcement will lead to 
any policy changes or new policy in 
AAPS.

The State of Michigan
On a state level, the battle 

for transgender rights has been 
much more contentious. The state 
legislature 
is 
currently 
under 

Republican control and Democrats 
complainof an inability to pass 
legislation they view as vital.

A proposed guidance issued by the 

Michigan Department of Education 
in February, advising schools to 

take 
action 
toward 
protecting 

LGBTQ students — particularly 
by highlighting the need to allow 
transgender students to use the 
restroom of their choice — drew ire 
from Republican legislators such 
as state Sen. Patrick Colbeck (R–
Canton).

“Our schools, our teachers, our 

administrators are on the frontline 
of a culture war in our society, and 
as their proponents push their social 
agenda into our classrooms, the 
quality of education our children 
receives suffers,” Colbeck proclaimed 
on the Senate floor on March 22, 
in response to a directive from the 
Michigan Board of Education calling 
for transgender students to be given 
access to the bathroom of their 
identity.

“Over 50 percent of our third 

graders can’t read, math proficiency 
for some schools hovers in the 
teens, and now we have these new 
guidelines that further divert our 
educators from their core mission — 
that of teaching our kids. It is time 
to take a stand against this social 
engineering,” Colbeck added.

State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D–Ann 

Arbor) said it is highly unlikely for 
the state to pass any legislation 
aimed at fighting discrimination 
against 
transgender 
individuals. 

He went on to reference a State Sen. 
Tom Casperson (R–Escanaba) who 
threatened to introduce a bill similar 
to the North Carolina bathroom bill, 
but it never actually came to fruition.

Because of this, Irwin said 

environment protections for students 
must come from individual districts.

“I think the progress is going 

to have to be school by school and 
community by community, rather 
than through the state legislature,” 
he said. “I don’t anticipate the state 
legislature doing something positive.”

In 
the 
state 
of 
Michigan, 

transgender 
students 
in 
K-12 

schooling 
reported 
rates 
of 

harassment at 84 percent, physical 
assault at 44 percent and sexual 
violence at 10 percent. Nine percent 
of the reported harassment was so 
severe that it led the individual to 
drop out of K-12 or higher education 
schooling, according to a report by 
the National Center for Transgender 
Equality and the National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force.

Irwin does hope to see legislation 

addressing 
other 
concerns 
of 

transgender individuals, including 
a push to have hormone drugs used 
by people in transition covered by 
Medicaid and allowing transgender 
individuals to change the gender that 
appears on their state identification, 
both of which he cited as key issues 
for the transgender community.

Currently in Michigan, 19 percent 

of transgender individuals have been 
refused medical care due to their 
gender identity/expression, and 35 
percent reported postponed needed 
medical care when they were sick 
or injured due to discrimination, 
according to the NCTE and the 
NGLTF.

Kaufman also mentioned a general 

need in the transgender community 
for the protection of transgender 
women, 
specifically 
transgender 

women of color. According to the 
National Coalition of Anti-Violence 
Programs’ most recent report, nearly 
90 percent of LGBTQ homicide 
victims in 2013 were people of color, 
with 72 percent being transgender 
women and 67 percent transgender 
women of color.

Kaufman said any attempt to 

better the lives of these individuals 
is vital.

“Getting 
these 
women 
the 

resources they need and recognizing 
all the shit they have to deal with and 
trying to improve their lives in any 
way is very important,” Kaufman 
said.

“I am confident that she will be

Wolverines lose to Oakland

By NATHANIEL CLARK

Daily Sports Writer

What had been an immensely 

frustrating week for the Michigan 
baseball team appeared to be 
ending in the bottom of the ninth 
inning of Tuesday’s game.

Junior 
catcher 
Harrison 

Wenson approached home plate 
with runners on first and second 
with one out. It was his chance to 
be the hero.

But he grounded into an inning-

ending double play and Oakland 
scored a run in the next frame to 
top the Wolverines, 6-5. Michigan 
(12-8 Big Ten, 34-17 overall) is now 
on a five-game skid for the first 
time since 2013.

“We talked about believing that 

we could do it,” said Michigan 
coach Erik Bakich referring to his 
team’s rally. “We’ve had big innings 
many times this year. Everyone just 
found a way to get on base. We tied 
it up and had the chance to win. We 
just didn’t win it.”

Down 5-2 in the ninth, senior 

pinch-hitter 
Dominic 
Jamett 

began Michigan’s comeback by 
getting hit by a pitch. On the 
next at-bat, sophomore shortstop 
Michael Brdar lifted a fly ball to 
right field that appeared to be an 
out before the right fielder dropped 
it. Freshman second baseman Ako 
Thomas then drew a walk to load 
the bases with no one out.

Senior 
center 
fielder 
Cody 

Bruder took advantage as he hit 
a bases-clearing double past the 
third baseman to tie the game at 
five. Junior left fielder Carmen 

Benedetti was intentionally walked 
before Wenson grounded into his 
double play.

The Golden Grizzlies (10-12 

Horizon, 22-24) put the nail in the 
Wolverines’ coffin in the tenth 
when left fielder Myles Zilinsky 
singled to center to drive in the 
game-winning run. Michigan went 
down without much of a fight in the 
tenth as a one-out walk by junior 
right fielder Johnny Slater was 
followed by another double play.

“It’s always tough to have an 

emotional roller coaster like that,” 
Bruder said. “It just didn’t work out 
for us.”

Before the ninth inning, the 

contest was a fairly low scoring 
affair.

Oakland scored in the top of 

the first when right fielder Tyler 
Pagano hit a two-out, two-run 
home run. The Golden Grizzlies 
threatened further damage when 
second 
baseman 
Ian 
Yetsko 

reached on a fielding error and Ben 
Hart singled up the middle.

But Michigan sophomore right-

hander Ryan Nutof kept Oakland in 
check when he got the next batter 
to fly out to left field.

The Wolverines’ offense, which 

had been stymied for the first four 
frames, turned on in the bottom of 
the fifth inning.

Bruder came to bat with runners 

on first and second and one out. 
He singled up the middle to drive 
in Michigan’s first run while 
Benedetti followed up with his own 
RBI single to tie the game. Bruder 
finished Tuesday with four hits in 
five at-bats and four RBI.

The 
Golden 
Grizzlies 
were 

poised to strike again in the sixth 
when they put runners on second 
and third with two outs. Center 
fielder Ryan Fitzgerald came to the 
plate with a chance to put Oakland 
on top.

Both runners scored during 

Fitzgerald’s at-bat, but they did on a 
balk and a wild pitch, respectively. 
Michigan was in a two-run hole of 
its own making.

The Golden Grizzles mounted 

another offensive in the eighth 
when catcher Matt Dileo came to 
bat with a man on second and no one 
out. He laid down a sacrifice bunt 
down the third base line to advance 
the runner to third.

But the throw hit Dileo in the 

helmet and bounced past first base, 
allowing a run to score and leaving 
Michigan down 5-2 before its 
ultimately unsuccessful comeback 
effort one frame later.

“(The last week) has been a 

rough patch for us,” Bruder said. 
“We know we’re a good team and 
we know that we’ll come out of this 
stronger than we were coming in. 
I think we’ll be alright, but teams 
have rough patches.”

Even 
with 
their 
recent 

frustrating stretch, the Wolverines’ 
are still in 36th place in the rating 
percentage index standings, which 
will be used to help determine 
which teams make the NCAA 
tournament.

Before that, though, Michigan 

will try to regain momentum with 
a three-game road series at Illinois 
beginning May 19 as a prelude to 
the upcoming Big Ten Tournament.

‘M’ can right the ship

On May 10, the Michigan baseball 

team was riding a five-game winning 
streak, scoring 63 runs while 
surrendering just 11 in that span. The 
Wolverines, in spite of a combined 
1-4 record against Minnesota and 
Michigan 
State, were 
just 
one-

half game 
away from 
the top spot in the Big Ten and were 
off to their best start since 1987.

Today, Michigan is on a five-game 

skid, its longest since 2013, in which 
it has been outscored 31-19. The 
Wolverines are now fifth place in 
the conference standings with three 
contests left.

“The last week has been an 

emotional 
roller 
coaster,” 
said 

Michigan 
coach 
Erik 
Bakich. 

“Losing is not something that we 
are accustomed to or will ever get 
accustomed to.”

To add insult to injury, three 

of Michigan’s losses came from a 
sweep by its arch-rival, Ohio State. 
The Wolverines’ 3-2 loss May 13 was 
especially painful as the game ended 
when the Buckeyes’ centerfielder 
robbed senior designated hitter 
Domenic Jamett of a game-tying 
base hit with a diving catch.

But the most frustrating contests 

for the Wolverines during their 
recent struggles were undoubtedly 
their two non-conference matchups.

Against Central Michigan on 

May 10, Michigan found itself in 
an 8-0 hole after four frames. The 
Wolverines nearly erased the deficit 
thanks to four by freshman left 
fielder Jimmy Kerr. But they came 
up one run short, dropping an 8-7 
game to a Chippewas team that has 
won just 18 games this season.

It was a similar story for Michigan 

against Oakland on May 17. Trailing 
5-2 going into the bottom of the 
ninth, senior center fielder Cody 
Bruder broke through with a three-
RBI double to both tie the game 
and put the winning run in scoring 
position. Junior left fielder Carmen 
Benedetti was intentionally walked 
on the next at-bat in order to set up a 
potential double play.

That brought junior catcher 

Harrison Wenson to the plate, 
hoping to strike back against the 
Golden Grizzlies, but he was unable 
to be the hero when he grounded 
into an inning-ending double play. 
Oakland put up an RBI single in the 
next frame for the win.

Wenson 
has 
been 
in 
an 

uncharacteristic slump as of late, 
recording just two hits in his last 
20 at-bats. The Wolverines will 
certainly need him to recreate his 
earlier-season success if they are to 
snap out of their current funk.

Michigan 
has 
been 
playing 

without outfielder Matt Ramsay, 
who is currently out with an injury. 
He was a fixture at the second spot 
in the Wolverines’ lineup, posting a 
.298 batting average, four home runs 
and 28 RBI.

“I feel really bad for (Ramsay),” 

Bruder said. “It’s his senior year. To 
end like that is pretty awful.”

But according to the team, a big 

part of its struggles has been players 
feeling under pressure, as Bruder 
said after the Oakland loss.

“It seems like everyone feels like 

every pitch is magnified at this point 
of the season,” Bruder said. “If you 
take a strike, you feel a little worse 
than at the beginning of the season.”

Added Bakich: “You can sense the 

frustration in everybody. Some guys 
maybe are pressing or trying too 
hard to change that outcome.”

To be sure, the Wolverines have 

more than enough ability to turn 
things around. Michigan is hitting 
.310 as a team, the second highest 
mark in the Big Ten, and are tied for 
first in the conference with 310 runs 
scored. The pitching staff leads the 
Big Ten with 440 strikeouts.

The Wolverines also have a 

three-game series at Illinois to fine 
tune themselves before the Big Ten 
Tournament.

While 
the 
Fighting 
Illini’s 

record does not appear imposing 
when compared to Michigan’s, the 
Wolverines have played significantly 
better at home than on the road — 
16-4 and 13-13, respectively. Illinois, 
meanwhile, is 11-4 at home this 
season.

Michigan is No. 36 in the NCAA 

rating percentage index standings, 
the highest ranking of any Big 
Ten team. While that puts the 
Wolverines in solid position for 
making the NCAA Tournament for 
the second straight season, losses at 
Illinois could jeopardize Michigan’s 
chances if it does not repeat as the 
Big Ten Tournament champion.

“We know we’re a good team,” 

said 
sophomore 
infielder 
Jake 

Bivens. “We’ll be alright, good teams 
have rough patches.”

Bivens is right that the Wolverines 

are a good team, but they’ll need 
to shape up quickly if they want to 
achieve their goals.

With late comeback, ‘M’ 

wins share of Big Ten title

By MATTHEW KENNEDY 

Daily Sports Writer

Two days into the Big Ten 

Outdoor 
Championships, 
the 

Michigan 
women’s 
track 
and 

field team was nowhere close to 
following up its Big Ten Indoor 
Championship with another title. 
The Wolverines were in sixth place 
with one day remaining, and even 
worse, they were 33 points behind 
the leader, Minnesota.

To most, the deficit would appear 

to be too grand. But for Michigan, 
they knew their best day was still in 
store.

“We were down a lot, to be 

honest,” said Michigan coach James 
Henry. “We just had to take care 
of what we could control, and that 
was to get people into the finals 
and compete as best you can in the 
finals.”

The Wolverines entered the day 

with 23 points, but quickly gained 
six points when sophomore Claire 
Kieffer-Wright claimed third place 
in the high jump with a height of 
1.82 meters.

Things started to get even better 

for Michigan Sunday when fifth-
year senior Shannon Osika — who 
was the Big Ten Indoor Champion in 
the mile — and redshirt sophomore 
Jaimie Phelan finished one, two in 
the mile, giving the Wolverines 18 
more points. Only two hours into 
the day, and already Michigan had 
doubled its previous point total, 
giving the team a glimmer of hope.

Still, though, much was yet to 

come. Only 20 minutes after the 
one, two sweep, senior Cindy Ofili 
vaulted the Wolverines even closer 
to the top with her third consecutive 
championship in the 100-meter 
hurdles, narrowly winning by one 
second with a time of 12.91 seconds.

 Junior Sami Mitchell also 

finished seventh in the 100-meter 
hurdles, providing two small — yet 
pricelessly crucial — points to the 
team’s championship hopes. In the 
next race, the 400-meter dash, the 
Wolverines’ winning streak came 
to an end, but senior Maya Long was 
able to add four more points to the 
team’s point total with a fifth-place 
finish.

“You can’t win a championship 

with all big fish and all big points,” 
Henry said. “Every point counted 

for us. The winning kids were just as 
important as the kid who took eighth 
place for us because it actually was 
every point that counted, and we 
would not have won without the 
eighth-place kid. Every star shined 
for us.”

The 
stars 
especially 
started 

to shine in the 800-meter run, 
Michigan’s best event of the meet. 
Fifth-year senior Devon Hoppe 
— who won the Big Ten Indoor 
Championship in the same event — 
took first place with a time of 2:06.73, 
and right behind her was Osika for 
the one, two sweep. Redshirt junior 
Danielle Pfeiffer finished fourth, 
giving the Wolverines a total of 23 
points in the event – matching the 
number they entered the day with.

“During the race I got a little boxed 

in, but when the opening came I just 
took it,” Hoppe said. “That was my 
plan from the beginning, to make a 
really strong, confident move when 
the opportunity presented itself. I 
trusted myself, and things worked 
out great.”

After a fifth-place finish in 

the 100-meter dash by Ofili gave 
Michigan four more points, the 
Wolverines had a chance to take the 
lead with a win in the 5,000 meter 
run. Promptly, they did such that.

Redshirt sophomore Gina Sereno 

— who won her first Big Ten event in 
the 10,000 meter on Friday — gave 
Michigan 10 more points, and a lead 
with one event remaining, with a 
victory in the 5,000 meter. Four 

hours after they weren’t even in the 
top five, the Wolverines needed only 
one more race to sweep the Big Ten 
Championships for the first time 
since 2003.

Michigan entered the final race — 

the 4 x 400 meter relay — with 102 
points, one more than Minnesota’s 
101. With a win, the Wolverines 
would 
be 
outright 
champions, 

while a loss by more than one spot 
would give the Golden Gophers the 
crown. For the collective good of 
both teams, though, neither of those 
scenarios happened.

Minnesota finished the race 

in the fourth place with a time of 
3:32.50, giving its team five points 
and a total of 106 points. Michigan, 
finished in fifth place with a time of 
3:33.42, giving its team four points 
and total of: 106 points.

“We knew that the score was 

tied, but no one really knew what 
that meant,” Hoppe said. “I ran over 
to (assistant coach) Mike (McGuire) 
and said, ‘What happens?’ and he 
just laughed at me and said, ‘We 
both win!’ After that, everyone got 
really excited and there was a lot of 
celebrating.”

After the meet, some of the 

athletes thought there might be 
a tie-breaker. But in the end, the 
lackluster first two days were a 
thing of the past, and the score 
the board in Lincoln, Neb. read 
was the one that stood: Michigan 
106 and Minnesota 106 – Big Ten 
Champions.

Wolverines finish 
second at Big Tens

By LANEY BYLER

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan men’s track and 

field team went to the Big Ten 
Outdoor Championships in hope 
of proving itself as one of the best 
teams in the Big Ten — and it did 
just that.

Returning home with a final 

score of 90.5 points, the Wolverines 
secured their best outdoor finish 
since 2008 and finalized a runner-
up finish at the championships. 
After setting the pace on the first 
day of competition with 15 points 
and sitting at second in the 13-team 
pool, the team 
scored 
an 

additional 33.5 
points on the 
second day to 
maintain 
its 

position.

However, 

it wasn’t until 
the third day 
of 
competition 
that 
Michigan 

demonstrated what it was capable 
of. The Wolverines scored 42 points 
on the final day to set themselves 
apart from third-place Purdue, 
securing their spot as the Big Ten 
runner-up.

Fifth-year senior Mason Ferlic 

led the pack, finishing his Big Ten 
career with a win in the 3,000-
meter 
steeplechase 
Saturday, 

making 
him 
a 
back-to-back 

champion in the event. He also 
won the 5,000-meter run Sunday, 
doubling up on first-place finishes. 
He is the first athlete in the the 
Big Ten to take home titles in both 
events since 2002.

“Honestly, going into this meet, 

I never once thought, ‘This is my 
last Big Ten race,’ ” Ferlic said. “I 
love that I’ve had the opportunity 
to race in the Big Ten, so for this 
to be the last experience I’ve had, 
it makes me happy. Achieving all 
of the goals and finishing the way 
I did, I couldn’t be more proud of 
this team and everything we have 
accomplished.”

Freshman Taylor McLoughlin 

made his Big Ten Championship 
debut this weekend, and also 
snagged a title in the 400-meter 
hurdles. He finished the race with 
a time of 49.80, the fourth-fastest 
time in the NCAA this year and 

sixth in the world in athletes under 
20 years old.

With additional points coming 

from junior Ben Flanagan’s win 
in the 10,000-meter run and 
senior Steven Bastien’s win in the 
100-meter dash and impressive 
performance in the decathlon, 
Michigan was in good standing 
throughout 
each 
day 
of 
the 

competition. The throwers also 
helped boost the Wolverines, as 
they were the only Big Ten team to 
score in every throwing event.

Junior Grant Cartwright stood 

out, scoring a 54.97 meters in discus, 
the fifth-best mark in Michigan 

history. 
He 

finished fifth in 
the event.

“The 
first 

thing 
that 
it 

boils down to 
is 
coaching,” 

Cartwright 
said. “My coach 
will always say 

it’s the athletes who do it, but we 
couldn’t have come as far as we 
did without him. The other thing 
is just how we carry ourselves as 
throwers. We’re very competitive. 
We strive to be leaders on the team 
in scoring points and setting the 
tone for the meet.”

The Wolverines took home 

enough titles to secure them 
a 
runner-up 
finish 
at 
the 

championship and achieve their 
best outdoor score in eight years. 
While they haven’t always been at 
the top of the scoreboard, it’s hard 
to ignore their recent successes and 
improvement.

“When 
I 
came 
in 
as 
an 

underclassman, it felt like no one 
took us seriously as a powerhouse 
program,” Ferlic said. “To watch 
the progression under our head 
coach Jerry Clayton and Kevin 
Sullivan, and to be a part of that 
kind of improvement over a short 
window of time is a great Michigan 
legacy. This is something I’ll forever 
be proud of.”

With 
Michigan’s 
strong 

performance in the Big Ten Outdoor 
Championships, it’s looking to 
continue its recent domination. The 
Wolverines are laying down a track 
of success, and they plan to follow 
it all the way through the NCAA 
Tournament.

NCAA Softball Regional Preview

By AVI SHOLKOFF

Daily Sports Writer

After a devastating loss to No. 

23 Minnesota last weekend, the 
Michigan softball team traveled 
back home to Ann Arbor with only 
one week to prepare for an NCAA 
Regional. 
The 
second-ranked 

Wolverines will host Valparaiso in 
their first matchup Friday night. 
With Notre Dame and Miami (Ohio) 
rounding out the four-team regional, 
the Daily previews each team in the 
Ann Arbor regional.

No. 2 Michigan

Despite its loss in the Big Ten 

tournament final, No. 2 Michigan 
remains the overwhelming favorite 
to advance from the region. The 
Wolverines (22-2 Big Ten, 46-5 
overall) lead the nation in scoring 
with 8.41 runs per game and rank 
second nationally in batting average 
with an impressive .355 clip.

Senior second baseman Sierra 

Romero didn’t record a hit in six 
at-bats during the first two games of 
the Big Ten tournament but notched 
three hits, including a home run, in 
the championship game. Romero 

sits seventh in the nation with a .472 
batting average and ranks first in 
runs per game. Senior centerfielder 
Sierra Lawrence adds offensive 
support in the leadoff spot, hitting 
.452 and scoring 1.39 runs per game, 
good for first in the nation.

In the circle, Big Ten Pitcher of 

the Year Megan Betsa will look to 
improve on her erratic performance 
in last weekend’s tournament. Betsa 
leads the nation in strikeouts per 
seven innings (11.5), but will need to 
keep her walks down in order to give 
the Wolverines a winning chance.

Though not as overpowering as 

Betsa, fifth-year senior right-hander 
Sara Driesenga maintains a solid 
presence in the circle with her ability 
to force ground balls. She posted a 
2.13 earned-run average and tallied 
21 wins this season.

Because of its top-to-bottom 

offensive firepower, Michigan is 
most likely to advance to the Super 
Regional. Every player currently sits 
at .300 clip, and no other team in the 
region can match that stat.

No. 20 Notre Dame

Much like Michigan, offense 

is vital to Notre Dame’s success, 

ranking fifth nationally in batting 
average with a solid .351 clip and 
scoring seven runs per game. The 
Fighting Irish (13-7 Atlantic Coast, 
41-11 overall) finished third in the 
ACC and made it to the tournament 
final, where it lost to No. 8 Florida 
State.

Notre 
Dame’s 
lineup 
begins 

with center field speedster Karley 
Wester, who sports a .440 batting 
average and 42 stolen bases, good 
for ninth in the nation. Right-
hander Caitlyn Brooks and infielder 
Michaela Arizmendi add power 
to the lineup with 11 and 10 home 
runs, respectively. Arizmendi leads 
Notre Dame with 59 RBI and Brooks 
ranks second with 52. In the circle, 
left-hander Allie Rhodes notched 
18 wins alongside 148 strikeouts to 
anchor the Fighting Irish’s pitching 
staff.

Notre Dame will look to advance 

further than last season, when 
it reached the final game of its 
regional, only to fall to Kentucky in 
the final inning. Despite qualifying 
for the NCAA tournament in their 
previous 17 seasons, the Fighting 
Irish have never advanced past the 
regional stage.

Because 
of 
its 
prestigious 

conference schedule and NCAA 
Tournament 
experience, 
Notre 

Dame has the best chance of 
upsetting Michigan this weekend.

Miami (Ohio)

Miami arrives in Ann Arbor after 

winning four consecutive games to 
emerge victorious in its conference 
tournament.

The 
Redhawks 
(15-7 
Mid-

American, 34-21 overall) ranked 
second in the MAC with a .284 
batting average and 55 home 
runs, 11 of which came from their 
lead-off hitter, infielder Michaela 
Schlattman. Outfielder and No. 3 
hitter Taylor Shuey leads the team 
with 47 RBI and a .378 batting 
average.

Spearheading Miami’s rotation 

is right-hander Amber Logemann 
who pitched 207 innings this 
season. Logemann doesn’t strike 
many batters out but manages 
to hold opposing batters to a low 
.227 average. Logemann received 
the MAC Tournament MVP after 
winning all four starts and allowing 
just four runs in 32 innings.

Inconsistency best sums up the 

Redhawks’ seasonal performance, 
as they have had winning and losing 
streaks of at least five games.

While its offense may be potent 

for the MAC and it may be riding 
a 
seven-game 
winning 
streak, 

Miami pales in comparison to 
Michigan and Notre Dame. With the 
Redhawks’ lack of tougher regular-

season competition, they will have 
a difficult time against the Big Ten 
champions and ACC-runners up in 
the Wolverines and Fighting Irish, 
respectively.

Valparaiso

Valparaiso (8-14, Horizon League, 

18-32 overall) finished sixth out of 
nine teams in the regular season in 
the Horizon League. The postseason 
though, told a different story. The 
Crusaders received an automatic 
NCAA Tournament bid through 
four consecutive upset victories en 
route to a conference championship.

Offensively, infielder Sam Stewart 

catalyzes Valparaiso, leading the 
Crusaders with seven home runs 
and 32 RBI. In the circle, Taylor 
Weisenhoffer will look to hold her 
own against Michigan’s powerful 
hitters Friday. The right-hander 
finished second in the Horizon 
League in strikeouts with 159 and 
fourth in opponents’ batting average 
with .248.

Valparaiso faced only one ranked 

opponent this season, an early 16-5 
run-rule loss to then-No. 10 Florida 
State.

Now in the NCAA Tournament 

for the first time since 2013, the 
Crusaders will look to show that 
they belong in the tournament 
despite a lackluster regular-season 
record. But Valparaiso has yet to 
face a team nearly as powerful as 
the Wolverines, and may struggle 
against such a dynamic offense.

DELANEY RYAN/Daily
