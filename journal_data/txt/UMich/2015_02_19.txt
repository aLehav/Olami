Full strategic plan 
recommended by 
committee in Sept. 

not yet released

By GENEVIEVE HUMMER

Daily Staff Reporter

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel hosted 200 students, 
faculty and staff members Mon-
day morning in the Michigan 
League Ballroom to jump start 
a campuswide conversation on 
diversity.

Schlissel 
announced 
plans 

for the leadership breakfast in 
December through an e-mail 
newsletter delivered to students 
and faculty. In September, the 
Office of the Provost released 
reports from three faculty-led 
committees that included 13 rec-
ommendations for diversifying 
the campus, including the cre-
ation of a strategic diversity plan.

Michigan Daily reporters were 

not invited to Monday’s event.

According to a University 

press release and several facul-
ty, administrators and students 
who attended the event, Schlis-
sel announced intentions to pri-
oritize the issue during his term, 
echoing sentiments similar to his 
September inaugural address.

“I am committed to making 

diversity, equity and an inclusive 
campus environment a major 
focus of my presidency,” Schlissel 
said. “Together, we can embrace 
the best parts of our past and the 
brightest minds of the future, and 
create new levels of pride and 
excellence for everyone in the 
University of Michigan commu-
nity.”

Though 
Schlissel 
acknowl-

edged the challenges ahead, he 
expressed optimism for the Uni-
versity’s ability to achieve signifi-
cant change.

Issues of diversity, inclusion 

and equity have played a promi-

Men’s rowing 

team earns second 
straight win at event

By LEV FACHER

Managing Editor

The Michigan men’s rowing 

team might not get much public-
ity around campus, but on the 

Hill Auditorium stage, it reigns 
supreme.

Wednesday night, the Wolver-

ine rowers channeled their inner 
Walt Disney to repeat as champi-
ons of the Student-Athlete Advi-
sory Committee’s Mock Rock 
event, an annual charity com-
petition that pits various teams’ 
wacky 
performances 
against 

one another before hundreds of 
current and former athletes, stu-

dents, fans and alumni.

The event was conceived in 

1999 in honor of Jeff Reese, a 
member of the Michigan wres-
tling team who passed away 
while training for an upcom-
ing event. This year, SAAC 
partnered with the Ann Arbor 
YMCA, contributing proceeds 
to benefit children’s programs in 
the Washtenaw County area.

The winning act was an 

impressively orchestrated musi-
cal-theater rendition of “The 
Little Mermaid,” complete with 
dozens of costumed rowers. 
Some of the more notable getups 
included a crab, a large card-
board boat named “S.S. Boat,” a 
jellyfish, a rock, a seahorse and, 
of course, a mermaid.

While appointed judges have 

decided the winner in the past,

Exchange signs up 

almost 341,000 
residents during 
open enrollment 

By JACKIE MILLER

Daily Staff Reporter

When open enrollment closed 

Sunday, almost 341,000 Michigan 
residents had signed up for health 
insurance through the Affordable 
Care Act’s insurance marketplace 
— a 25 percent increase over last 
year.

Both 
the 
general 
Health 

Insurance 
Marketplace 
and 

the Healthy Michigan Plan, the 
state’s Medicaid expansion pro-
gram, have experienced some 
level of success in the last year.

With the closure of the enroll-

ment period last Sunday, Presi-
dent Barack Obama said 11.4 
million people signed up for or 
renewed their coverage during 
the three month period.

Currently, 
559,965 
benefi-

ciaries are covered under the 
Healthy Michigan Plan, which 
is designed to cover residents 

between the ages of 19 and 64 
who have an income at or below 
133 percent of the federal poverty 
line.

Carrie Rheingans is project 

manager for the Washtenaw 
Health Initiative, a countywide 
drive working to improve access 
to health care for low-income 
residents. She said the enrollment 
rates were surprisingly high.

“Overall, this number has real-

ly blown out of the water any esti-
mates that anybody was making 
in the state,” Rheingans said.

Rheingans added that she is 

not aware of any major issues that 
have occurred within this year’s 
first enrollment period, but noted 
that Michigan residents seem-
ingly learned from the previous 
period, and are becoming smart-
er shoppers.

In particular, Rheingans said 

many are concerned about which 
health insurance plans their doc-
tors will accept, as patients gener-
ally want to stick with the doctor 
that they are currently with.

“Many patients who enrolled 

the first time, last year, who are 
re-enrolling this year have been

Roey Gilad 

discusses regional 

challenges to 
Israel’s borders

By TANYA MADHANI

Daily Staff Reporter

During his second visit to 

the University on Wednesday 
evening, Roey Gilad, consulate 
general of Israel to the Mid-
west, provided an update about 

current events in the Middle 
East from the perspective of 
the Israeli government.

The event, titled “Israel: 

Facing the New Challenges in 
the Current Middle East,” was 
sponsored by the University’s 
chapters of advocacy groups J 
Street, I-LEAD, WolvPAC and 
the American Movement for 
Israel as well as the Universi-
ty’s Center for Middle Eastern 
and North African Studies.

LSA

about giving a speech.

“People are very interested 

in the relationship with our 
campus and Israel,” Lev said. 
“(Gilad) gives a very detailed 
perspective of it, as well as 
giving an educated one … and 
I think that’s really important

For the Daily

University faculty and students 

will soon play a role saving lives 
in a country thousands of miles 
away.

The University has helped 

establish a medical partnership 
in Ethiopia, called the Center 
for International Reproduction 
Health Training. Launched Feb. 
6 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the 
collaboration consists of eight 
Ethiopian medical schools and 
a partnership with the Federal 
Ministry of Health of Ethiopia.

The CIRHT looks to equip 

future medical doctors with life-
saving reproductive health care 
services, according to Senait 
Fisseha, the center’s executive 
director and an associate profes-
sor of obstetrics and gynecology.

Lawsuit focuses on footing 
drain disconnection program

Ann Arbor 

residents challenge 
sewage mitigation 
efforts for homes

By LAURA SCHINAGLE

For the Daily

Ann Arbor residents Anita Yu, 

John Boyer and Mary Raab sued 
the city last year over the legal-
ity of a program requiring home-
owners install sump pumps in 
private residences.

In the original complaint, 

filed in February 2014 as Yu v. 
City of Ann Arbor, the plaintiffs 
alleged that the program inflict-
ed uncompensated burdens and 
monetary costs. The plaintiffs are 
seeking monetary compensation, 
as well as injunctive relief and a 
statement that the drainage pro-
gram violates their right to due 
process.

Though a Washtenaw County 

Circuit Court judge ruled last 
week not to sanction the city after 
the plaintiffs alleged court pro-
ceedings were drawn out unnec-
essarily, the legal battle over the 
policy is far from finished.

Launched in 2001, the city’s 

footing drain disconnection pro-
gram was intended to reduce 
stormwater flow to the sanitary 
sewer system, which had caused 
sewage 
backup 
problems 
in 

homes throughout the city. To 
divert water from the sanitary 
sewer system to the stormwater 
drainage system, the program 
mandated that the footing drains 
in residents’ homes be discon-
nected and replaced with sump 
pumps.

The suit implies that the city 

engaged in questionable prac-
tices in adopting and executing 
the program. Among other com-
plaints, the plaintiff claims the 
city gave favorable treatment to 
certain private contractors by 

granting them the exclusive right 
to install the required footing 
drains on private properties.

On Feb. 12, the court heard the 

plaintiffs’ oral argument in which 
they called on the judge to sanc-
tion the city for unreasonably 
drawn out legal proceedings. The 
plaintiffs sought monetary sanc-
tions for “the fees and costs occa-
sioned by the continued burden 
in this case of protecting them-
selves from a seeming attack by 
the City.”

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Anne Warrow, 
the city’s project manager, main-
tained that the footing drain dis-
connection program was based 
on legitimate studies that con-
sidered the welfare of Ann Arbor 
residents.

The plaintiff’s attorney Irvin 

Mermelstein said in an interview 
that this was not the case.

“These people didn’t study 

anything,” he said. “They knew 
exactly what they were doing.”

The 
two 
plaintiff 
parties 

— Boyer and Raab, who live 
together, and Yu — said they did 
not 
experience 
sewer-related 

problems before pumps were 
installed in their homes under the 
program. The lawsuit’s key com-
plaint, Yu says, is that due to a dis-
ability, cannot maintain a sump 
pump without a contractor, and 
the city has not compensated her 
for this burden. Likewise, Boyer 
and Raab cited uncompensated 
burdens, 
including 
recurring 

flooding and the necessary instal-
lation of a $600 backup hydraulic 
pump.

When the case was first filed 

in the Washtenaw County Cir-
cuit Court, the city attempted to 
remove the case to federal court. 
However, the plaintiff countered 
with a motion to send it back to 
state court, which was granted. 
A series of motions followed, 
including unsuccessful motions 
to reassign the case to another 
judge and to disqualify the city’s 
legal counsel, Abigail Elias.

Last Thursday, Elias argued 

Movie screening highlights 
issues within prison system

Director Gabriel 
London chronicles 
life of escape artist 

Mark DeFriest

By ALAINA WYGANT

Daily Staff Reporter

The 
student 
organization 

Human Rights Through Edu-
cation hosted a showing on 
Wednesday of “The Mind of 
Mark DeFriest,” a documentary 
that follows a prison escape art-
ist, along with a Q&A session 
with the movie’s director.

The film will appear on Show-

time in March and won the Best 
Documentary Feature award at 
the Lone Star Film Festival.

In the film, DeFriest, a cur-

rent inmate at a Californian 
prison, was originally incarcer-
ated for theft, a four-year sen-
tence, in 1981. However, due to 
frequent escape attempts, his 
sentence was increased.

Now with 34 years in prison 

behind him, 27 of which were 
spent locked in solitary, DeFri-
est has a chance at obtain-

ing parole thanks to the film, 
whereas before he would have 
likely stayed in prison until his 
death.

In an interview, Gabriel Lon-

don, the film’s director, said 
he thought the film built up 
momentum around the case.

“The film itself catalyzed a 

lot, and the audience catalyzed 
a lot, too,” London said. “When 
the film was released, his parole 
date was 2085, and now I think 
there’s a very real possibility 
he’s going to get out of prison.”

He said he first heard of 

DeFriest 
while 
working 
on 

another prison documentary. 
Noticing he was one nonviolent 
offender among many violent 
offenders locked in solitary con-
finement, he found the letters 
DeFriest had written while in 
prison, and began tracking his 
story.

London said his focus with the 

documentary was on examin-
ing how individuals arrive in the 
criminal justice system.

“We imprison very freely,” 

London said. “The federal system, 
for example, the majority of its 
prisoners are nonviolent.”

DeFriest was first put in soli-

tary confinement while under-
going a psychiatric evaluation, 
according to the film. During 
his subsequent time in solitary 
confinement in several prisons, 
London said DeFriest was denied 
clothing, and was also accosted 
with water from a hose. The film 
also points to torture and gang 
rape DeFriest underwent at the 
hands of other prisoners.

Theater and Drama Prof. Ash-

ley Lucas, director of the Uni-
versity’s Prison Creative Arts 
Project, also joined London for 
the Q&A, answering questions 
about a slightly different issue — 
the role of creativity in prison.

Prisons are boring, she said.
During 
his 
incarceration, 

DeFriest made keys, painted, 
carved soap and wrote poetry, 
among other activities.

Law Prof. Samuel Gross, editor 

of the Law School’s National Reg-
istry of Exonerations, also spoke 
before the film screening about 
the topic of exoneration. He said 
the attention DeFriest’s case has 
garnered from the documentary 
is the exception when it comes to

Fisseha, who was born in Ethi-

opia, helped create CIRHT and 
was able to do so in part through 
an anonymous $25 million grant 
to the University’s Department of 
Obstetrics and Gynecology. The 
program, Fisshea said, is needed 
in Ethiopia.

“Ethiopia has one of the high-

est maternal mortality ratios in 
the world, and one of the con-
tributing factors is the huge 
unmet need for comprehensive 
reproductive health care servic-
es,” she said.

The CIRHT works to train 

health care officials and future 
medical professionals, providing 
students with hands-on experi-
ence in the profession. The pro-
gram aims to develop new leaders 
who will stay on and contribute 
to the health care in Ethiopia.

Fisseha 
said 
the 
gradu-

ates’ capabilities have already 
increased. 
The 
demand 
for 

health care has also increased 
as more Ethiopian women seek 
help from the new program.

The University’s role in Ethio-

pia will also include the design 
and creation of projects intend-
ed to contribute in other ways. 
Engineering graduate student 
Ibrahim Mohedas has been at the 
forefront of one of these projects.

Mohedas has been to Ethiopia 

three times with the University, 
and has played a role in develop-
ing a prototype to help insert a 
long-term contraceptive into the 
arms of Ethiopian women, a pro-
cess that generally risks harm-
ing muscle tissue. The prototype 
would safely deliver the contra-
ceptive injection and nullify the 
risk of muscle damage when 
removed.

“The long-term goal of a 

device like this would definitely 
be to expand access to long-term 
contraceptives,” Mohedas said. 
“In the bigger picture, we’re 
looking at how to design devices 
specifically for rural areas of 
low resource settings, where so 
much of the world’s population 
is but so few medical devices 
work.”

The program also focuses on 

data collection in the country.

Public Health student Belen 

Michael spent the last summer in 
Ethiopia engaged in data analysis.

While there, Michael and fellow 

students were able to interview and 
discuss issues of fertility and repro-
duction with men and women in 
Ethiopian clinics. The data research 
is still ongoing and Michael said the 
information has provided insight 
into both medical and cultural per-
spectives in Ethiopia.

“What I got was trying to find 

this balance of being cultur-
ally sensitive, but still trying to 
bring these beneficial methods 
to women,” Michael said.

coming in and asking more spe-
cific questions about enrollment 
this year,” she said.

Similar to last year, Rhein-

gans said many people have 
waited until the last minute to 
apply for health insurance. She 
attributed the trend to those 
with lower incomes commonly 
working more than one job and 
helping take care of other fam-
ily members. Those factors make 
it harder to find the time to go 
online and thoroughly consider 
the options.

Currently, Michigan is one of 

27 states, along with the District 
of Columbia, that has chosen to 
expand Medicaid through the 
Healthy 
Michigan 
program. 

Rheingans said Michigan’s plan 
differs somewhat from those 
in other states. Unique provi-
sions include asking beneficia-
ries to make contributions to 
the program, similar to tradi-
tional health insurance, such as 
copays. After four years, benefi-
ciaries earning above 100 per-
cent of the federal poverty line 
will be asked to make more con-
tributions.

“I think some things that our 

state did in the development of 
the Healthy Michigan Plan that 
are different from other Med-

icaid programs in the country 
will make other states be more 
interested in possibly expand-
ing Medicaid,” Rheingans said.

Student volunteers with the 

Washtenaw Health Initiative, 
like Public Health student Pau-
line Do, disseminated infor-
mation about the ACA as well 
as the Healthy Michigan Plan 
across the community.

“Since Michigan just expand-

ed its Medicaid program last 
year, most people, including 
students, do not realize that 
they qualify for Healthy Michi-
gan, so that has been my main 
focus,” Do said. “Personally, I 
have only done one-to-one out-
reach, but I believe it is very 

successful.”

Unlike the general insurance 

exchange, Healthy Michigan 
does not have an enrollment 
deadline.

However, Do said individu-

als still may be able to enroll in 
the general marketplace beyond 
the initial February deadline, 
as long as they experienced a 
qualifying life event, such as a 
change in income or residence.

“The most rewarding thing 

about disseminating informa-
tion about health care coverage 
is making this process a little bit 
easier for individuals, and see-
ing people enroll with the help 
of certified enrollment counsel-
ors on the same day,” Do said.

this year its organizers took a dif-
ferent route, opting to let audi-
ence members vote for a winner 
via text message. The combined 
performance of the men’s and 
women’s track and field teams 
took second place, with the field 
hockey team taking third.

Aaron Ward, who starred for 

the Michigan hockey team from 
1990 to 1993 before winning three 
Stanley Cup trophies in the NHL 
— two for the Detroit Red Wings 
and another for the Carolina Hur-
ricanes — emceed the event.

Following the men’s rowing 

team’s performance, Ward noted 
that he would have to break his 
promise to his young daughter, 
who was expecting to see video 
footage of the event afterward. 
According to Ward, seeing the 
film’s protagonist Ariel with chest 
hair and a beard wouldn’t go over 
well.

The Michigan baseball team 

kicked the night off with an 
impressive display of uninten-
tionally improvisational comedy. 
Redshirt sophomore right-hander 
Cam Wysocki didn’t decide what 
his act would entail until the last 
possible moment, but he pulled 
some last-second strings to make 
it work.

“I came up with that about 

… this morning,” Wysocki said. 
“I’ve done the same kind of thing 
the last three years , and it’s more 
fun if I come up with it the day (of 
the event).

“That’s how you get that kind 

of raw emotion that you don’t 
really see in other acts, because 
we have no idea what we’re doing 
until we’re actually on stage.”

Neither did the five fresh-

men Wolverines whom Wysocki 
enlisted for his act, which con-

sisted of him calling up an unsus-
pecting female volunteer to sit in 
a chair at center stage. Wysocki 
serenaded her with a rendition of 
Stevie Wonder’s “Isn’t She Love-
ly” before calling out the first-
years to push the boundaries of 
what could appropriately be done 
in mixed company — all through 
song, dance and a selfie.

Though absent due to a home 

game against Indiana, the Michi-
gan women’s basketball team 
managed to contribute. Junior 
guard Halle Wangler starred as 
a snack-food thief in a video the 
Wolverines filmed beforehand 
and showed during the event. 
Also playing leading roles were 
freshman forward Jillian Dun-
ston, who deceived her team-
mates into believing they had 
an upcoming day off, and senior 
forward Nicole Elmblad, who, 
upon discovering the rest of her 
teammates fooling around on the 
practice court, kicked off a whole-
squad “twerk” session.

“There were a few takes,” Elm-

blad told the Daily following her 
team’s 68-52 victory over Indi-
ana Wednesday night. “There 
were a couple of scenes that took 
us longer than they should have, 
especially when you have a whole 
team together trying to do a video 
thing. Everybody’s got their opin-
ion and what they want to do, but 
it was a lot of fun.”

Not to be left out, the Michigan 

marching band also orchestrated 
a relatively lengthy act that alter-
nated between sketch comedy and 
dance. As with the other groups, 
the marching band didn’t miss 
out on an opportunity to poke fun 
at itself in its depiction of a flirta-
tious interaction at band camp.

“So what?” said one band mem-

ber to another. “People are awk-
ward. Plus, we’re band kids. We’re 
all awkward.”

offer an academic perspective on 
Israel’s geopolitical and interna-
tional challenges, but one from 
the perspective of the Israeli gov-
ernment.

“This is my job and my respon-

sibility,” Gilad said. “The Arab 
Spring that started four years 
ago created the most geopoliti-
cally challenging situation which 
we are facing as a state since our 
establishment 60 to 70 years ago.”

Gilad said Israel faces four 

forces in the Middle East that 
challenge its borders. He said 
these forces include the “Shi-
ite Axis” stretching from Iran, 
Iraq and Syria; the traditional 
moderate Sunni Muslim block 
in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan 
and the Arab Gulf; as well as the 
Hamas and the Islamic State, 
also known as ISIS.

“You see how these new geo-

political maps of the Middle East 
is being translated into a direct 
threat … to Israel,” Gilad said. “I 
think it is fair to say that Israel 
has too many challenges and 
some opportunities.”

He said Iran continues to 

threaten and challenge the legiti-
macy of Israel’s statehood and is 
currently the country’s biggest 
challenge in the Middle East.

“We are at a very sensitive time,” 

he said. “We believe that Iran is a 
real threat to the state of Israel and 
to the region. I think nobody would 
like to see a nuclear Iran.”

Gilad also discussed the mili-

tary action in the Gaza Strip 
carried out by the Israeli govern-
ment last July. He said the Israeli 

government is committed to a 
two-state solution to the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, but said Pal-
estinians should also recognize 
Israel as a Jewish state.

“This is an opportunity to 

build some kind of partnership 
(between Israel) and the Sunni 
block,” he said.

Gilad 
said 
he 
approached 

I-LEAD because he wanted to 
bring the concerns of the Israeli 
government and people to the 
Jewish community in the Mid-
west.

“All the kinds of concerns that 

we have in Israel, sometimes it’s 
hard to understand them when 
you are so far, at such a distance,” 
Gilad said. “If I’ve managed to 
express some of the concerns 
that we have in Israel from all 
this very challenging geopolitical 
situation, that’s basically what I 
came to do today.”

LSA freshman Emilie Weisberg 

said she thought Gilad provided a 
balanced perspective while still 
maintaining his own opinion.

“I really just found that from 

his speech I was educated a bit 
more on the issues and it helped 
me see things from a calm, ratio-
nal perspective,” Weisberg said.

LSA junior Daniel Pearlman 

said he enjoyed how Gilad spoke 
from the Israeli government’s 
perspective.

“He spoke from the heart and 

the government,” Pearlman said. 
“Despite everything you see on 
the news about war, there’s a 
sense of optimism and there’s 
huge opportunities to work with 
Sunni moderate groups … It’s easy 
to forget there are real people liv-
ing in the Middle East and it’s not 
just a conflict.”

nent role on campus over the last 
year. In November 2013, mem-
bers of the University’s Black 
Student Union launched the 
Being Black at the University of 
Michigan campaign — using the 
hashtag #BBUM on Twitter — to 
draw attention to the experienc-
es of Black students on campus. 
The student organizers later 
demanded the University make 
process around a series of policy 
initiatives, including increasing 
minority enrollment.

Among initiatives currently in 

the works, Schlissel announced 
the University has begun a Stra-
tegic Plan for Diversity and said 
he plans to gather department 
chairs later this semester to 
discuss diversity and inclusion. 
He also listed plans for a cam-
puswide diversity summit in 
the fall, new partnerships with 
school districts home to under-
represented populations and a 
task force to consider hiring and 
promotion of underrepresented 
faculty.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily last month, 
Schlissel noted the University’s 
long-standing goal to diversify, 
but said current strategies must 
be improved.

“It really is fair to say that 

there has been a long-term com-
mitment to diversity at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, I think the 
record is really clear,” he said. 
“The problem is, our success 

hasn’t matched our aspirations 
despite people’s serious efforts 
and serious commitments.”

Martha Jones, associate chair 

of the Department of Afroameri-
can and African Studies and 
associate professor of history 
and Afroamerican and African 
Studies, attended the event and 
said she was excited by Schlis-
sel’s interest in campus-wide 
diversity.

“I thought it was a very 

bold morning and I was very 
impressed as I learned that 
our new president was going to 
make diversity one of his major 
agenda items for the term of his 
presidency,” Jones said. “What I 
saw on Monday was a president 
that seemed poised to lead us on 
a new path, and that for me was 
new and that for me was why it 
was an exciting and important 
morning.”

However, Jones said she’s 

interested to know more about 
initiatives in the works, particu-
larly ongoing strategic planning.

“I’m eager to hear more 

details as they develop,” she said.

After 
outlining 
his 
pri-

orities, Schlissel fielded ques-
tions and comments from the 
event’s attendees. According to 
a University press release, one 
attendee asked what takeaways 
attendees should communicate 
to their colleagues.

“I think it’s fair to tell them 

that there’s skepticism in the air 
because words are easy, and I 
think it’s fair to tell them that the 
president and the senior leader-
ship and the regents themselves 
are ready to be held to account,” 

Schlissel said.

“I not only need your ideas, I 

need your criticism,” he said. “I 
need you to poke me with a stick. 
I need you to hold me and the 
leadership team and the regents 
to account, so that we have the 
conversation again and again.”

Pharmacy 
student 
Kristye 

Russell, who attended the event, 
said she is concerned how the 
plan would meet the needs of 
graduate and professional stu-
dents enrolled in schools out-
side of the Rackham Graduate 
School.

“The biggest challenge is 

going to be getting an initia-
tive to roll out that is going to be 
widely adopted and accepted on 
campus by everybody and that 
is going to meet everybody’s 
needs,” she said.

Jones said Schlissel’s talk 

focused primarily on campus cli-
mate issues, which she said are 
less quantifiable, but equally as 
relevant as admissions and hir-
ing statistics.

“Our climate issues need to 

be understood and addressed so 
that faculty, students and staff 
all feel welcome, safe, encour-
aged and at the center of the life 
and learning that goes on here,” 
she said.

Esrold Nurse, LSA assistant 

dean for undergraduate educa-
tion and executive director of 
the Newnan Academic Advising 
Center, attended the breakfast 
and agreed that changing the 
campus climate is important.

“All students need to feel wel-

comed in our community,” Nurse 
wrote in an e-mail interview. 

“Prospective (underrepresented 
minority) students need to see 
the University as a place which 
acknowledges differences and 
embraces it.”

Nurse said Schlissel’s ideas 

are key for laying important 
groundwork on the issue.

“Yet to ensure progress, the 

President’s ideas will require 
immediate and specific plans 
to take us from ideas to action 
and must by necessity involve 
all schools and colleges, faculty, 
staff and students in the develop-
ment of those plans,” he wrote.

LSA senior Cesar Vargas, who 

attended the event, is a first-gen-
eration college student. He said 
students need to build a greater 
understanding of the socioeco-
nomic diversity at the University.

“In today’s day one of the big-

gest taboos people have a hard 
time talking about is social 
class,” Vargas said. “One way to 
approach that is to inform people 
about the disparities that occur 
within the educational system.”

Sandra Gregerman, director 

of the Undergraduate Research 
Opportunity Program, wrote in 
an e-mail interview that she felt 
Schlissel made his commitment 
to diversifying the campus clear.

“The 
tenor 
and 
emotion 

shared by President Schlissel 
was deeply appreciated by some-
one who has been working on 
these issues for a long time, and 
his call to ‘nudge’ him and share 
concerns, ideas, and critiques 
demonstrated his deeply felt and 
personal commitment to creat-
ing a more diverse and inclusive 
campus community,” she wrote.

the city acted reasonably in its 
defense and that the plaintiffs 
did not show sanctions were 
warranted.

In an interview with The 

Michigan Daily, Elias would 
not speak to specific allega-
tions the plaintiffs have made 
against the footing drain dis-
connection program, but said, 
“We’re confident in the legal-
ity of the program.”

Preluding his ruling, Judge 

Timothy Connors, the Washt-
enaw County Circuit judge, 
said he respects the parties’ 
use of the available legal tools 
to pursue their goals. Connors 

highlighted two fundamental 
principles of the court — pro-
tecting witnesses from undue 
harassment 
or 
embarrass-

ment, and ascertaining truth. 
Connors said he took those 
principles into account, and 
exercised judicial restraint in 
his decision to deny the plain-
tiffs’ motion for sanctions.

Mermelstein 
said 
he 

believes the circuitous nature 
of this case goes against the 
principle to ascertain truth.

“The big problem is that 

we’re supposed to have all kinds 
of protections that we have in 
federal court that we don’t have 
here,” Mermelstein said.

Mermelstein said deposi-

tions in the case are scheduled 
to begin in March.

similar cases.

“Most of the cases get very 

little attention,” he said.

LSA 
freshman 
Sabrina 

Zayec, who attended the 
screening, said her initial 

reaction was disappointment 
in the justice system.

“You see a lot of these 

problems and reports done 
in third-world countries and 
Guantanamo Bay but you 
don’t see the abuse that was 
reported in the Florida State 
Prison,” Zayec said.

eing a contestant on “The 
Bachelor” isn’t so different 
from being a recent gradu-

ate. Before you roll 
your eyes, hear 
me out. Sure, it’s 
easy to poke fun 
at the 30 women 
on the show who 
cry when the one 
man they’re all 
simultaneously 
dating sends them 
home (those odds 
are never in your 
favor, girlfriend). 
And yeah, our tenure at most of our 
first jobs will be longer than most 
engagements resulting from “The 
Bachelor.” That being said, the simi-
larities between the show and the 
process almost every student goes 
through while looking for a job are 
fairly significant.

When we send in job applications, 

sometimes hundreds of other people 
are applying for the one position that’s 
open. Even though we know the num-
bers are working against us, we feel 
rejected when we don’t make it to the 
final round of interviews or — worse 
— when we lose the job to someone 
else in the last leg of the hiring pro-
cess. Simply substitute “The Bachelor” 
prize of a relationship with a 30-some-
thing farmer/doctor/athlete for a job 
with Goldman Sachs or an entry-level 
position at a consulting firm and we’ve 
put the “reality” in “reality TV.” “The 
Recent Grad” is a show we unani-
mously sign up for when looking for 
employment, and it’s helpful to know 
what we’re getting ourselves into 
before we join the contest.

Hiring managers are our own 

personal Bachelor Brads, and we do 
everything we can to stand out from 
the other contestants. We dress to 
impress when we meet them. We 
practice our answers to typical 
recruiting questions over and over. 
We send out tailored resumes and 
cover letters, hoping to make it to the 
next round of casting and land a cov-
eted spot to audition for the role of 
fiancée, er, financial advisor.

The connections between the 

standard job hunt and this televised 
husband hunt don’t end there. The 
first night’s cocktail party on “The 
Bachelor” weirdly reminds me of 
career fairs – basically, they’re a 

hot mess. Even though they lack 
limo service and free wine, people 
still nervously wait to deliver their 
elevator pitch to recruiters, cut-
ting others off if need be. Trade in 
“Whitney, Fertility Nurse, Chicago” 
for “Whitney, History Major, Uni-
versity of Michigan” and you have 
the bullet points from most con-
versations that happen during this 
stressful experience.

If you make it past basic introduc-

tions with a recruiter and actually 
get your foot in the door, there are 
still a bunch of tests to pass before 
the recruiter pops the question, “Do 
you want to work here?” These chal-
lenges could come in the form of 
cases, one-on-one interviews or on-
site consultations.

Case interview questions will 

show the employer how you might 
perform if given the job. On “The 
Bachelor,” contestants are forced to 
write songs or play paintball to show 
their 
potential 

husband 
what 

they’re made of. 
On “The Recent 
Grad,” 
young 

professionals 
have to solve a 
problem or com-
plete a task, often 
in a group set-
ting. Contestants 
who 
underper-

form or try to dominate the conversa-
tion may be eliminated, while those 
who innovate and succeed will often 
move onto the next round.

This 
success 
is 
short-lived, 

though, because the group interview 
is just the beginning, and a recent 
grad may be chosen for many of these 
before they end up getting a coveted 
one-on-one interview. If you make 
it to this round, be prepared for oth-
ers to resent you for this opportunity 
(job hunting is a tough sport). Also, 
be aware that some people may try to 
come back into the competition after 
they were eliminated. Don’t worry, 
though, history shows us these peo-
ple usually don’t last long if they’re 
allowed back in the race. Let the 
other contestants ice them out until 
they’re forced to leave and just keep 
your eyes on the prize.

One-on-ones are scary because 

they’re pretty much make-it-or-
break-it moments. In order to get 

asked to move onto the next round 
(usually a rose isn’t included, but 
hey, a recent grad can dream, right?) 
you have to impress the interviewer. 
Bond over common ties, like Michi-
gan alumni status or a shared love 
of biking. Go along with whatever 
they have planned for the one-on-
one, answering their questions about 
your goals and past. Ask them ques-
tions, too, because it’s important they 
know you’re interested in them … as 
an organization.

If you survive your group inter-

views and one-on-ones, give yourself 
a round of applause, because you’re 
headed for an on-site interview. 
While you may be nervous about 
going to the organization, seeing the 
office and meeting the hiring man-
ager’s co-workers, knowing they 
like you enough to invite you to their 
hometown can give you a bit of peace. 
The best advice I can give you? Be 
honest and be yourself. That’s what 

they’ve appreci-
ated about you 
all along and that 
is what’s gotten 
you to this stage 
in the game.

If you end up 

getting hired at 
the end of all of 
this, congratu-
lations! 
You’ll 

probably 
stay 

with the company for about a year 
and then part ways, blaming the 
separation on bad timing or leav-
ing the job for something better. 
If you don’t end up getting the job, 
don’t feel badly about that sting of 
rejection you feel. Even though you 
are just one of many candidates 
the hiring manager is looking at, 
you’re still human and tears have 
been shed over much less. Seri-
ously, just watch women cry about 
losing the love of their life when 
they are kicked off “The Bachelor” 
after talking to the guy for maybe 
12 minutes total. Throw a little 
pity party, pick yourself back up 
and start sending out more applica-
tions. You’ll win the contest before 
you know it and then you’ll be set 
for life (or at least until you break 
up with your first job).

O

ver the past weekend, the film “Fifty 
Shades of Grey” shattered records 
by grossing more than $94.4 million 

dollars over the four-day 
holiday weekend. Though 
Universal Studios had orig-
inally planned on releasing 
the film in October of 2014, 
the movement of the pre-
miere to Valentine’s Day 
proved advantageous. Over 
the course of the weekend, 
one that is typically spent 
celebrating the longevity of 
healthy relationships, thou-
sands of women — 68 per-
cent of ticket sales — instead crowded into 
movie theaters.

Opposed to contributing to the fiscal suc-

cess of the film, I instead committed myself 
to reading the first installment of E. L. James’ 
trilogy, “Fifty Shades of Grey.” The novel tells 
the story of Anastasia Steele, a young woman 
who — like myself — is no more than 22 years 
old, in the final moments of her undergradu-
ate education and completing a degree in Eng-
lish literature. From there, the plot unravels.

The relationship maintained between 

Christian Grey — a disturbed young busi-
ness magnate with supposedly out-of-this-
world good looks — and 
Anastasia is overbearing, 
if not suffocating. After 
being 
interviewed 
by 

Anastasia for the school 
newspaper, Grey begins 
stalking her and tracking 
her phone, claiming his 
“affection” for her. And 
by affection, he means 
he desperately wants to 
physically assault her and 
chain her to all four posts 
of his bed. He determines that she should be 
his 16th submissive relationship, the terms 
and conditions of which grant him com-
plete control over her sexually, as well as 
her eating and exercise habits, schedule and 
 

clothing choices.

I do not understand how it’s not blatantly 

clear that the relationship between Anasta-
sia Steele and Christian Grey is not one to be 
lusted after, and Christian Grey is not a man 
to be desired or fantasized about. The most 
antagonizing element of the novel, and pre-
sumably the film, is Ana’s insistence that she 
loves him. Though this adoration is almost 
entirely unrequited, Ana’s internal dialogue 
reads, “This is a man in need. His fear is 
naked and obvious, but he’s lost somewhere 
in the darkness … I can sooth him, join him 
briefly in the darkness and bring him into 
 

the light.”

No, Ana, you cannot bring him into the 

light, and this plot is as tiresome and repeti-

tive as E. L. James’ attempts at dialogue. 
The storyline of “Fifty Shades of Grey” sug-
gests to women that despite how dark or 
tortured a man is, if you endure his violence 
and abuse, you may have a shot at changing 
him. And if he’s rich, handsome and able to 
fly a helicopter? All the more reason to stay, 
because degradation is a small price to pay 
for material wealth. It suggests to men that 
continuously pushing a woman’s limits may 
ultimately yield in your favor, either once 
you’ve exhausted her with your badgering 
or poured her enough glasses of Prosecco. It 
suggests that sex is an act entirely intended 
for pleasure, and it need not be compli-
cated by strong emotions or backed by a 
 

meaningful relationship.

When was being stalked, bullied and 

bribed into a domineering and physically 
violent relationship deemed a fantasy? This 
is not a fantasy. This is an example of behav-
ior following which you call the police and 
request a restraining order. Sure, there are 
books two and three, in which Ana pre-
sumably has a positive effect on Christian, 
unearths his emotions and they engage in 
a “vanilla” relationship (one that Grey still 
obsessively controls) — but the damage of this 
first installment has been done. Even if the 
film adaptation tones down some of the more 

concerning elements, its 
production still perpetu-
ates a subscription to the 
entire franchise.

Granted, the intrigue 

of the series is — no pun 
intended 
— 
seductive, 

and in a warped sense, E. 
L. James’ work could be 
considered groundbreak-
ing. By all means, I’m an 
advocate for consensual 
and emotionally healthy 

sexual exploration, but as a woman who 
respects herself and her independence, I can-
not in good conscience contribute my meager 
finances to the success of this film. Buying 
a ticket to the film would serve as a valida-
tion of the messages it sends — and as women 
lust after Christian Grey, I’m concerned that 
men may want to emulate his behavior. While 
some argue that the dramatic arc eventually 
criticizes the one-sided, emotionless behav-
ior exhibited in “Fifty Shades of Grey,” the 
commercialization of the trilogy into a line of 
sex toys and bondage kits is chilling.

In essence, “Fifty Shades of Grey” is a 

poorly written, sexually explicit repeat of 
“Beauty and the Beast” that projects an out-
dated adage. Fix the beast and you can have 
the castle? Forget the beast, and buy your 
own castle.

S

aturday was Valentine’s Day. 
The day gets a bad rap, often 
deemed the Hallmarkiest of 

Hallmark holidays 
(see too: Mother’s 
day, Father’s day). 
Well first of all, 
fuck the haters. It’s 
my birthday. And 
now that that’s out 
of the way: it’s only 
a “holiday” if you 
only plan on buying 
gifts for those you 
love on one single 
institutionally pre-
ordained day of the year. Boom. Now 
you feel guilty.

But the claim isn’t exactly inaccu-

rate. A recent survey by the National 
Retail Federation (NRF) reveals 
some fascinating points, least of all 
that spending this year on Valentine’s 
Day is projected to be the highest 
ever, at $18.9 billion. That is, in other 
words, 11 basis points (hundredths of 
a percent) of U.S. GDP. All exchanged 
in chalky hearts (candy makes up 
of 53.2 percent of purchases), roses 
(flowers are 37.8 percent), anything 
the color red (clothing is 16.3 percent) 
and mandrake roots (OK, not really).

Perhaps more interestingly, the 

survey reveals some behavioral 
trends that have taken place. Indeed, 
since 2007, 13 percent fewer people 
are celebrating the holiday. Of those 
celebrating, 18 percent fewer are 
buying cards for their loved ones, 
and 23 percent fewer are going 
“for an evening out.” Well that just 
doesn’t seem very romantic. Instead, 
31 percent more Romeos are buying 
gift cards. And funny enough, it’s 
not actually a terrible strategy — for 
these hunks, it may be the case that 
Amazon’s recommendation engine 
legitimately knows what their beaus 
want more than they do. Bezos, you 
stallion! Finally, the last piece of 
data worth considering is one I just 
find sad: that 56 percent of women 
plan to celebrate the day, while 53.7 
percent of men plan to. Assuming 
that the numbers of homosexual 
couples of both genders celebrating 
are the same, I am so sorry for that 
2.3 percent of ladies…

But if we cut the jokes and take a 

deeper dive into this data, the trends 
observed really aren’t that shocking. 
Lovers are more risk-averse since the 

financial crisis. Millennials seem to 
be particularly traumatized.

Arthur C. Brooks wrote a wonder-

ful qualitative piece in The New York 
Times Friday, titled “Taking Risks 
in Love.” In it, he tells the anecdote 
of his own hot pursuit of his Spanish 
wife. The story bears much in com-
mon with a rom-com that a Natalie 
Portman-Ashton Kutcher or Mila 
Kunis-Justin Timberlake duo might 
act in, with a little bit of Woody Allen 
mixed in for good measure. Brooks 
quit his job, left his family, learned 
Spanish, moved to Barcelona, got the 
girl and lives happily ever after. But 
the point of the article is not patting 
himself on the back, but rather ask-
ing why he would never be able to pat 
on his younger colleagues’ backs (or 
Facebook walls) for doing the same 
thing. “That’s crazy,” they say, after 
he tells the fai-
rytale. Cupid got 
him good. He’s 
just an old-fash-
ioned, 
smitten 

nut. To parse out 
the intergenera-
tional language 
barrier — what 
risks he took for 
love.

Yet, 
Brooks’ 

confusion is a justified (and much 
publicized) one: why are millennial 
lovebirds such wimps?

A ton has been written on the 

subject of love in a digital era. The 
topic du jour, of course, is Tinder. 
The headline of another New York 
Times Valentine’s Day op-ed pretty 
much sums it up: “On Tinder, Tak-
ing a Swipe at Love, or Sex, or Some-
thing, in New York.” The popularity 
of Tinder seems to prove the fact that 
the extent of “risk” young adults feel 
comfortable taking, in love (or sex, 
or something), is limited to four pic-
tures, a name and an age on a profile. 
If you match, great. If you don’t, who 
cares; you really only “met” the girl 
in the time it took to send a motor 
impulse down to your thumb. It’s 
certainly a lot less painful than get-
ting rejected on the phone, or in per-
son, or after a flight to Barcelona.

This same sort of “love hedg-

ing” exists to a lesser extent with 
EHarmony, or OKCupid or Farmers 
Only, or any of the others. Clearly, 
risk aversion pervades the romantic 

marketplace as much as it does the 
financial. Potential pain, anxiety and 
stress are managed by maintaining a 
well-diversified portfolio of uncorre-
lated romantic investments. Eggs are 
spread between baskets.

It’s prospect theory all over again: 

losses hurt a whole lot more than 
gains heal. Loss avoidance is pri-
oritized over the pursuit of gain. Per 
the survey: a gift card and a movie at 
home provide a lot more wiggle room 
during 
conversational 
awkward 

pauses than does the time between 
appetizer and entrée at a restaurant. 
Calamity avoided.

Now back to Brooks’ question: 

why are we such wimps? Well, in 
retrospect, it seems pretty obvious 
— it’s actually far more rational to 
be wimpy. Shells are the best form 
of protection, particularly when 

we have enough 
stresses 
and 

strains on our 
plates 
already. 

Especially 
fol-

lowing what we 
witnessed hap-
pen to the coun-
try during the 
financial crisis. 
Vulnerability 
and its symp-

toms are, amidst overworked lives 
in school and in the office, insensi-
bly risky. The means of desire are far 
less desirable than the ends.

From 
personal 
experience, 

though, love is far from rational 
(believe me, I’ve tried to “under-
stand” why some things have hap-
pened the way they have). So is this 
rational approach really a way to find 
love, rather than satisfy lust? As Sam 
Smith laments in the best song of the 
year: “Guess it’s true I’m not good at a 
one night stand / but I still need love 
‘cause I’m just a man / Deep down I 
know this never works / But you can 
lay with me so it doesn’t hurt.”

Apparently, people feel that.
But what to do about it? Who 

knows. Keep bumping uglies, and 
maybe one of these nights we’ll run 
into dates for next Valentine’s Day. 
Or maybe we won’t.

In either case, keep swiping right. 

It’s only rational, after all.

“Relative wealth” responses 

are digusting

 TO THE DAILY:

Upon reading Jesse Klein’s article, “Rela-

tive Wealth,” I was completely disgusted 
— but not by her article. Instead, I became 
mortified by the overwhelming number 
of callous responses. I do understand that 
income and wealth are sensitive topics, and 
therefore it’s not surprising that these topics 
evoked heavy emotion. Many comments on 
the article didn’t simply target Klein’s under-
standing of wealth and income, they target-
ed her and her intelligence. Was it anyone’s 
intention to discount her experiences, or is 
targeting someone the result of challenging 

her depth of knowledge on socioeconomic 
status?

As University of Michigan students, I 

believe it’s our obligation to teach each other 
and learn from each other, in every medium. 
The Daily’s presence on the Internet should 
not encourage us to mock each other, because 
we simply do not feel or see a human pres-
ence. Somewhere in the last decade, human-
ity lost motivation to listen and respect one 
another, and found self-satisfaction through 
spitting out vast amounts of knowledge on 
the Internet. I’m getting tired of all of this 
ego-driven commentary, and I hope I am not 
the only one.

RITA MORRIS/Daily

Senior forward Nicole Elmblad totaled nine points and 12 rebounds in Michigan’s win over Indiana on Wednesday night.
‘M’ snaps three-game 
losing skid vs. Indiana

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Writer

With just two weeks until the 

Big Ten Tournament, Michigan 
women’s basketball coach Kim 
Barnes 
Arico 
can 
mark 

another 
tally in this year’s win column.

Coming off three straight 

losses, the Wolverines (7-8 Big 
Ten, 15-11 overall) earned an 
easy 68-52 win over Indiana on 
Wednesday at Crisler Center. 
Michigan limited the Hoosiers 
from getting good looks by 
winning the defensive rebound 
battle by 18, an effort led by 
senior forward Nicole Elmblad.

More 
importantly, 
the 

Wolverines made the “hustle 
plays” that Barnes Arico has 
stressed to her players — the 
ones they hadn’t been making 
during the losing streak.

“In some of those tight 

games, when we look back, 
there were one or two of those 
plays that we didn’t make that 
could’ve 
been 
a 
difference 

maker,” 
Barnes 
Arico 
said. 

“Tonight we did a great job of 
sharing the basketball, making 
the extra pass and finding 
our teammates, and those are 
changing points for us.”

One such play came early in 

the second half, when Elmblad 
dove out of bounds to throw 
a ball back in, extending the 
possession that ended with a 
3-pointer from freshman guard 
Katelynn Flaherty.

For the first time since Nov. 

20, 
Flaherty 
was 
inserted 

into the lineup, and she didn’t 
skip a beat. With her help, the 
Wolverines shot 66.7 percent 
from the field in the first half 
— a season high — which gave 
them a 35-26 halftime lead.

With her first start in three 

months, 
Flaherty 
led 
the 

team with 21 points on 9-for-
17 
shooting, 
including 
two 

3-pointers. Behind her were 
senior guard Shannon Smith 
and sophomore guard Siera 

Thompson, who racked up 16 
and 15 points, respectively.

Much of the offense’s success 

can be attributed to senior 
forward Cyesha Goree. After 
battling significant foul trouble 
in the last three games, Goree 
committed only one foul, which 
came midway through the first 
half.

With Goree not having to 

worry about being taken out of 
the game, the Wolverines could 
rely on their most important 
inside presence to draw a double 
team and open up shooters on 
the outside.

“She has to realize it’s not 

about her scoring all the time,” 
Barnes Arico said. “If people 
are 
really 

focused 
on 

her that much, 
and 
sending 

two or three 
people to her, 
it’s good for 
our 
team. 

It’s 
going 

to 
open 
up 

things for her 
teammates, 
and it might 
not result in her numbers on the 
stats sheet being 20 points, but 
it results in Katelynn having 20 
points, Siera having open looks 
and Nicole cutting to the basket.

“We found easy shots because 

of Cyesha’s double-teams.”

As Goree — totaling four 

points and 12 boards — gave 
the offense a chance to click, 
Elmblad had the same effect for 
the defense. Michigan opened 
the second frame with a 25-9 
run in the first 11 minutes.

Though sophomore guard 

Danielle 
Williams 
wasn’t 

slotted in the starting lineup for 
just the second time in the last 17 
games, she added four defensive 
rebounds to the team’s 29.

But leading by example and 

paving the way for Michigan to 
make the necessary stops was 
Elmblad, who finished with 
nine points and 12 rebounds.

“I 
definitely 
focused 
on 

making 
sure 
to 
box 
out,” 

Elmblad said. “I felt like I didn’t 
do a very good job against 
Northwestern … and that really 
killed us.”

Added Barnes Arico: “She’s 

been sensational rebounding 
the basketball for us lately. … 
I’m happy she’s playing this well 
heading into the tail end of her 
senior year.”

The beginning of the second 

half 
didn’t 
exactly 
mirror 

the start of the first for the 
Wolverines, when Indiana (4-11, 
14-12) jumped out to a 6-0 lead 
as Michigan missed its first four 
shots and committed a turnover.

“I thought defensively, I 

was gonna have a heart attack 
the first couple minutes of the 

game, because 
we 
couldn’t 

get 
a 
stop,” 

Barnes Arico 
said. 
“Once 

we started to 
dig in and try 
to get some 
stops 
and 

play 
defense, 

we were able 
to get easier 
baskets 
in 

transition.”

But with a long 3-pointer 

from Thompson nearly four 
minutes in, the Wolverines 
finally got on the board.

The Hoosiers built a 17-11 

advantage 
throughout 
the 

next seven minutes, but once 
Elmblad and Flaherty subbed 
back into the game after a brief 
rest, Michigan started rolling.

Flaherty 
sparked 
the 

Wolverine 
offense 
midway 

through with a 3, and the 
defense held Indiana to nine 
points in the final nine-and-
a-half minutes — including a 
three-minute drought in that 
span.

When halftime came around, 

Michigan still had another 
20 minutes to put together 
even with a nine-point lead. 
But with the team firing on 
all cylinders, the ball never 
stopped bouncing the right way 
for the Wolverines.

‘M’ sticks to philosophy

By KEVIN SANTO

Daily Sports Writer

Any coach can talk philosophy 

until she’s blue in the face, but 
working that conviction into the 
fabric of a team is an entirely 
different ballgame — unless 
you’re Michigan softball coach 
Carol Hutchins.

Hutchins first learned the 

mantras that circulate through 
the Wolverines’ dugout from a 
sports psychologist by the name 
of Ken Ravizza. She attributed 
the specifics of her softball 
mindset 
to 
Ravizza’s 
book, 

“Heads Up Baseball: Playing the 
Game One Pitch at a Time.”

But that’s not to say that 

Hutchins hasn’t formulated her 
own unique philosophy during 
her tenure in Ann Arbor.

“Over the years, you realize 

that you always play the game 
of softball,” Hutchins said. “The 
game does not ever change. Your 
opponents change, and so there 
your perception changes. Or 
whether you come to hit with 
bases 
loaded 
versus 
nobody 

on and nobody out. You still 
have to see the ball and strike 
it, so nothing changes but your 
perception. (Ravizza) taught me 
how to teach that better.”

And if you spend time around 

the Wolverines, you’ll quickly 
become accustomed to Hutchins’ 
“one-pitch 
softball” 
idiom. 

This 
expression 
embodies 
a 

mentality that stresses evolving 
a new thought process every 
single pitch. It emphasizes the 
importance of not dwelling on 
the outcome of a previous game, 
or even the result of the previous 
pitch, in an appearance at the 
plate.

It’s about staying in the 

present moment during games, 
rather looking forward to what 
may happen in hypothetical 
situations.

This concept has translated 

well for a Michigan team that 
encounters 
perennial 
college 

softball 
powerhouses 
every 

season, the most recent being 
then-No. 
5 
Florida 
State. 

The Wolverines defeated the 
Seminoles 6-5 and 2-1 in a 
doubleheader on Saturday, and 

“one-pitch softball” certainly 
played a role in those victories.

“It slows the game down 

a little bit,” said sophomore 
infielder Abby Ramirez. “Instead 
of focusing on getting hits, you’re 
focusing on having good at-bats. 
I think it not only helps us with 
big games, but we (also) practice 
it every day. So it’s almost like just 
bringing what you do in practice 
to the game.”

For 
the 
majority 
of 
the 

Wolverines, the concept of one-
pitch softball is a brand-new 
experience, but that doesn’t 
mean they aren’t willing to 
embrace it. As Ramirez and 
sophomore 
outfielder 
Kelly 

Christner 
explained, 
high 

school and travel-team coaches 
focused on the end result of 
games rather than emphasizing 
the importance of the more 
intangible aspects.

“In high school, a lot of the 

mental game (wasn’t a big part),” 
Ramirez said. “But now, coming 
here, we notice the mental game 
is a huge part. We’re all talented 
enough, it’s just about who’s 
mentally stronger.”

The most interesting thing 

about this 20-player roster is 
that each individual believes in 
Hutchins’ philosophies — they 
aren’t simply cliché expressions 
designed for a press conference. 
Conventionally, this is a task that 
most coaches couldn’t achieve, 
but then again, Hutchins isn’t like 
most coaches.

“We trust her so much,” 

Ramirez said. “We know she 
genuinely cares for not just the 
outcome of the game, but for us 
as players, so she wants not only 
to win but she wants us all to do 
well. So we know that she’s not 
going to tell us anything wrong.”

Added Christner: “It’s Hutch. 

If you think about her past and 
all the success that she’s had, 
you almost have to believe that 
whatever she is saying to you is 
right. It’s worked in the past.”

So if you can count on seeing 

one thing at the Wilpon Complex 
this year, it will be Michigan 
battling one pitch at a time.

And it will quickly become 

apparent that Hutchins has been 
winning the coaching ballgame 
for 31 years.

Rivalry edge tilts back 
toward Michigan State

After two Michigan 
wins in 2014, MSU 

takes series at 
Crisler Center

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

After 
Michigan 
State 

polished off a regular-season 
sweep of the Michigan men’s 
basketball 
team 
at 
Crisler 

Center late Tuesday night, a 
reporter asked Spartans coach 
Tom Izzo if there was any 
NCAA Tournament talk with 
his team as it tries to lock up a 
bid.

“I’m sure some,” Izzo said, 

“but I think they were pushing 
more that they hadn’t won here.

“That was a big thing to 

them. I don’t get into all those 
things anymore. I’m just trying 
to get this team to play better. 
If we play better, I know we’ll 
be good enough to get in. If we 
play better, I think we can win 
games at a lot of places. But I 
think for (seniors Travis Trice 
and Branden Dawson), winning 
here was a big deal. We’ve had a 
couple of very tough losses here, 
if you remember.”

His 
team 
certainly 

remembered. 
Entering 

Tuesday, 
Michigan 
State’s 

seniors had won in every 
Big Ten venue except those 
of 
conference 
newcomer 

Maryland and Michigan. They 
took down No. 18 Wisconsin 
in Madison in 2012, No. 3 
Ohio 
State 
in 
Columbus 

a month later and finally 
Indiana in Bloomington in 
2014, nearly finishing the list 

of the conference’s harshest 
environments.

But one remained.
“Coming into this game, it 

was important,” Dawson said. 
“With myself and Travis being 
seniors, it was just coming out 
with intensity. … Getting this 
win tonight, it feels great for us, 
this program and the seniors.”

So when the Spartans rolled 

into Ann Arbor on Tuesday and 
beat Michigan again, the edge 
in the rivalry shifted north 
toward East Lansing a bit more.

After 
two 
one-point 

Michigan 
wins 
at 
Crisler 

Center in the first two years of 
their careers, 
Michigan 
State’s seniors 
dropped 
both regular-
season 
meetings last 
year. 
The 

Wolverines 
came 
back 

to 
win 
in 

Ann 
Arbor 

on 
Feb. 
23, 

and though the Spartans won 
the rematch in the Big Ten 
Tournament final, Michigan 
earned the higher seed when 
the NCAA Tournament bracket 
was announced afterward.

The Wolverines boasted the 

wins, the Big Ten title and the 
NBA draft picks. Michigan 
State’s seniors earned back the 
bragging rights with Tuesday’s 
victory.

“We knew it was a big 

game,” Dawson said. “I’m a guy 
from Indiana, but the whole 
Michigan-Michigan 
State 

rivalry has definitely grown on 
me.”

Added Trice: “It feels good. It 

makes you mad all the past few 
years, losing here.”

Trice and Dawson had won 

in other big venues before. 
They upset No. 7 Kansas in 
Atlanta in 2012, shocked No. 
1 Kentucky in Chicago in 2013 
and reached the Elite Eight 
with a victory over top-seeded 
Virginia in 2014.

But whether it be with Stu 

Douglass’ game-winning layup 
in 2012 or Trey Burke’s game-
clinching steal in 2013, a road 
win over their in-state rival had 
always eluded them.

“Last year, when those guys 

beat us twice, just sitting on 

the bench and 
watching, 
it 

was painful,” 
Dawson said. 
“It hurt a lot.”

On the flip 

side, no one 
on Michigan’s 
young 
team 

had ever lost 
to 
Michigan 

State at home, 
and 
the 

Wolverines continued to slide 
with their fifth straight loss.

Their losing streak started 

Feb. 1 at Michigan State, and 
two weeks later, after starting 
to gain momentum in 2014, 
Michigan is on the wrong end of 
the rivalry again.

“It’s tough to lose a big 

rivalry game, especially at 
home,” said junior guard Spike 
Albrecht. “You have to credit 
them. They played really well, 
and we aren’t going to win 
many games when we give up 
62-percent shooting from the 
field. It’s the first time we’ve 
lost at home to them in a few 
years, so it is tough.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL

“It’s tough to 

lose a big rivalry 
game, especially 

at home.”

“We found easy 
shots because of 
Cyesha’s double-

teams.”

2B — Thursday, February 19, 2015

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

There’s something undeniably 

alluring about the past. Even in 
our frenzied chase for the future — 
designing computers in our base-
ments and making waves in the 
stock market — we somehow still 
find ourselves stumbling into vin-
tage stores, lingering over dusty 
books and running our fingers 
through moth-eaten velvet. Part of 
it is pure nostalgia, an unshakeable 
longing for the retro, the rustic, the 
renaissance — but no matter if you 
are a multimillionaire or a whim-
sical 20-something, there are no 
flights to ancient Greece or Paris 
circa 1950. Instead, we must learn 
our history through the artifacts 
left behind, dug up and dusted off.

If you are Bill Gates, you may 

spend nearly $31 million on “The 
Codex Leicester,” the most famous 
of Leonardo Da Vinci’s scientific 
manuscripts. Or perhaps you are 
a literature fan like Microsoft 
co-founder Paul Allen, bidding 
$6 million on an original copy of 
Shakespeare’s “First Folio.” Or 
maybe you are just a whimsical 
20-something with an empty wal-
let and a hungry mind, reaching for 
the new and finding the old — as I 
did at the University’s Department 
of Preservation and Conservation 
at the University Library.

If it sounds like the kind of place 

where old Egyptians bring their 
dead to be mummified, you’re not 
too far off base. Instead of preserv-
ing artifacts to be buried, however, 
the University conservators are 
preserving ancient texts, books and 
photos to be brought back to life, 
either for circulation or restricted 
use in University libraries, as well 
as for personal requests. They are 
the 
behind-the-scenes 
wizards 

responsible for making documents 
legible under thick museum glass, 
keeping aged encyclopedias from 
falling apart on the Hatcher Grad-
uate Library shelf and resurrecting 
panoramic photographs of Detroit 
circa 1860.

“This is why we have the cool-

est job in the world,” said Shannon 
Zachary, the head of the depart-
ment of preservation and conserva-
tion, smiling. “We get to do what no 
one else can.”

I arranged to meet Zachary 

at the department lab on a frigid 
morning in early February — the 
hour when the conservators were 
usually the most busy. Despite its 
library affiliation, the lab is fairly 
far from campus, tucked behind 
Elbel Field and the train tracks. As 
I hopped the rusted tracks at sun-
rise, I envisioned myself on the set 
of “National Treasure” — standing 
in a sterile white room, snapped 
into latex gloves and surrounded by 
peeling yellow documents whose 

secrets could be revealed only 
by magniscope. These dramatic 
expectations dissolved quickly as 
I entered the building and wasn’t 
met with a thick FBI-issued vault, 
but rather a homey workshop that 
hummed with the energy of an art 
studio.

It was clearly still early. The 

large wooden work tables were 
mostly empty as I weaved around 
them, making my way to Zachary’s 
office in the back corner. Stretched 
from floor to ceiling of the work-
shop were racks of material rolled 
up like wrapping paper, waiting to 
be sheared off and stitched onto 
battered books. Atop the tables 
were 
extensive 
collections 
of 

exacting knives and massive paper 
cutters, stiff boards and spools of 
thread for book spinal repair and 
an expensive-looking camera with 
a giant bulb. Jutting into the cen-
ter of the room were makeshift 
cubicles designated to each conser-
vator, cluttered with mismatched 
stacks of ragged books and grin-
ning family photos.

A flash of color from one desk 

caught my eye — at least 200 plas-
tic figurines, in varying degrees of 
vibrance and age, peered out from 
the shelf. It was as if I had stepped 
into Santa’s workshop, except the 
toys were not flashy and new and 
looking to be loved — rather, they 
were well-worn and faded, waiting 
to be shined again.

The objects that come to the 

Preservation and Conservation lab 
are divided into two categories: 
circulation and special collections. 
Falling under the circulation group 
are materials sent in for mainte-
nance — specifically damage pre-
vention or damage repair — for 
the primary purpose of extending 
their library shelf lives. The neces-
sary repairs can vary greatly from 
book to book, making the conser-
vators take them on a case-by-case 
basis. Though this attention to 
detail is a trademark of the depart-
ment, with only two full-time book 
repairers and just eight worksta-
tions, it seems impossible to main-
tain every University book without 
some North Pole magic.

“Every repair is handmade from 

start to finish, so we give priority 
to rare and special books, or those 
with spindly and complicated 
bindings,” Zachary said. She then 
picked up a red encyclopedia from 
the table.

“Everything else — standard-

issued books like this, with just a 
little wear and tear — are shipped 

to our friends at a commercial 
binding company in Cleveland, 
Ohio, where they usually repair 
some 35,000 books a year. You can 
understand why we don’t want 
to send our fragile books to that 
assembly line.”

Another reason to keep the book 

in the lab is if there is a specific 
repair requested. Jeff Gilboe, one 
of the two full-time book repairers, 
works primarily with circulation 
materials — books needing damage 
repair and prevention, to be then 
put back on library shelves and into 
students’ hands. He was instructed 
to attach a pocket to the hard-
backed interior of a University bird 
guide, slim enough to fit a book-
mark. He demonstrates his process 
with expert precision: measuring 
the pocket dimensions onto sturdy 
paper, cutting, hinging the paper 
onto the cover flap securely. The 
request seemed strange to me — 
were there secret bookmark pock-
ets all over University materials? I 
asked what other special orders he 
received.

“The library folks love to add 

things to their books,” Gilboe said, 
laughing. “I have replaced pages, 
put in reading supplements and 
refurbished bindings in leather.”

His eyes shone with the passion 

of someone who has been working 
for nine years, yet is still just get-
ting started.

“We have these weekly meet-

ings where new stuff is brought 
in. There’ll be a really damaged 
book and everyone asks, ‘Should 
we commercially rebind it?’” Gil-
boe recounted. “I’ll usually just tell 
them that I can do the whole book.”

The other side of Preservation 

and Conservation, special collec-
tions, is much more private in com-
parison. Materials that fall under 
this category are, naturally, special: 
internationally treasured book col-
lections, valuable manuscripts and 

scores of archival material. The 
Special Collections Library does 
not circulate, but some materials 
can be viewed in the reading room 
on the eighth floor of the Graduate 
Library. And unlike the “Restricted 
Section” of the Hogwarts library — 
which must be snuck into under 
the cover of an invisibility cloak — 
all students are welcome to view 
the special collections, though they 
must request materials ahead of 
time.

Perhaps the most fascinating 

materials in special collections 
are the lengthy, tangled scrolls of 
papyrus, inked with ancient sym-
bols and religious scripture. The 
University currently holds the 
largest papyrological collection in 
North America — roughly 6,500 
linear feet of archival material. The 
collection was first introduced to 
the University in the 1920s, when 
Francis Kelsey, a former profes-
sor of Latin, (for whom the Kelsey 
Museum 
of 
Archaeology 
was 

named) purchased large quanti-
ties of ancient papyri from Egypt, 
much of which is still being held in 
a pressurized vault in the Graduate 
Library. Since then, conservators 
have been arduously working to 
piece together the papyri — a task 
so monumental, so fragile, that 
I’d imagine it would be similar to 
a painter unveiling a masterpiece 
composed completely of pricks of 
his brush.

For Leyla Lau-Lamb, the other 

book repairer, conserving papyrus 
is an art — and she is unquestionably 
a master, albeit an unconventional 
one. Upon first meeting, Lau-Lamb 
struck me as an eccentric genius 
in the flesh: petite and bespeckled, 
long silver hair tied at the nape of 
her neck, wearing an oversized 
sweater emblazoned with a star 
and fuzzy striped tube socks.

“I don’t wear gloves,” Lau-Lamb 

said, when asked to describe her 

process. “People are always sur-
prised, since these are very old and 
fragile documents. But this isn’t a 
visual task; it’s a feeling one. The 
papyrus that comes out of the vault 
doesn’t look like a scroll — it’s more 
like a tangled knot of fibers, not a 
document. I use my fingers to feel 
my way into it, very carefully, dis-
tinguishing between fibers making 
up the vertical and horizontal lay-
ers of the page.”

Lau-Lamb’s 25-year-old meth-

od, though unconventional, works 
— so much so that 10 years ago 
she published a papyrus conserva-
tion guideline for the Advanced 
Papyrological Information Sys-
tem (known as “APIS”) that was 
printed in 25 countries and is still 
actively used. Lau-Lamb laments 
our society’s lack of proper school-
ing in papyrological conservation, 
despite the abundance of archives 
to uncover.

“There are hardly any places to 

study conservation, in today’s soci-
ety and especially back in my day. 
Then, there were two places to go: 
England’s British Library and a 
conservation workshop in Berlin. 
So I went to Berlin for training,” 
Lau-Lamb said.

She then grinned conspiratori-

ally, “What we need is to grab the 
interest of more young people like 
you. Someone needs to keep resur-
recting these old documents.”

To help foster education for bud-

ding conservators, the Preserva-
tion and Conservation Department 
offers the Cathleen A. Baker Fel-
lowship, an annual $10,000 award 
that enables conservators of vary-
ing expertise to work in the lab and 
gain hands-on experience in the 
conservation of paper-based col-
lections. The department receives 
applications 
from 
conservators 

across the country, with each appli-
cant essentially pitching his or her 
project — past Fellows’ projects 
have included broad investigations 
of new conservation techniques, 
as well as the specific use of starch 
paste in book bindings — with the 
ultimate goal of benefitting both 
the Baker Fellow and the Univer-
sity.

This year’s Fellowship was 

awarded to Halaina Demba, whose 
project focus is on library and 
archive conservation. When we 
were introduced, Demba was hold-
ing a thick, faded-blue cookbook 
titled “American Frugal House-
wife,” for which she was recon-
structing a binding. As she flipped 
through the aged pages to show me 

where the sewing in the spine had 
unraveled, I noticed that the pages 
were littered with splotches. I 
asked if she intended to remove the 
stains, figuring that it was common 
practice in paper preservation.

“Definitely not,” Demba replied, 

surprisingly. “Especially in a case 
like this, where the words are 
still clearly legible. These stains 
— mostly oil stains, it looks like — 
are what give a book, particularly a 
cookbook, its character. I’ve found 
little bits of onion stuck to pages, 
and I keep them too.”

I laughed, at once amused and 

slightly disgusted.

“There’s a difference between 

an exhibit and an artifact,” Demba 
continued. “Documents that are 
on exhibit are there to be read — 
people want to know what the U.S. 
Constitution says. Here, we work 
with artifacts. We want them to 
maintain their utility, of course, but 
more importantly we want them to 
maintain their integrity. When you 
wash pages of their oil stains and 
onion bits, you lose this integrity.”

What happens, then, if the pur-

pose of the object is to be looked at? 
Senior conservator Tom Hogarth 
specializes in preserving 19th cen-
tury photographs. Like Lau-Lamb, 
Hogarth beats his own path — 
dressing in a bright yellow Hawai-
ian shirt to offset his shock of white 
hair, he introduces himself as a 
“black-and-white guy.” His current 
project is mounting an 1860 pan-
oramic photo of the Detroit River, 
taken from the Canadian border, to 
an archival board.

Like a sly magician, Hogarth 

pulled back the tissue covering the 
old picture for me, pointing out the 
tiny names of the ships and marvel-
ing at the photographic details that 
were revolutionary for the time 
period.

“Back then, people didn’t have 

smartphones that could take pan-
oramic photos,” Hogarth said, a 
wistful tone in his voice. “They 
took photos shot by shot, then past-
ed them together to make this — it 
took time. It was an art. Nowadays, 
my granddaughter can do it.”

What Hogarth’s granddaugh-

ter can’t do (at least not yet) is 
conserve the original panora-
ma so it lasts forever. In reality, 
only a handful of people in the 
world can do what the staff at the 
Department of Preservation and 
Conservation do — preserve our 
history, close the gap a tiny bit 
more between the past and our 
fast-paced world of fads and for-
getting.

Perhaps our fascination with 

the past can be summed up by this 
question, the one I can’t seem to 
shake: Why does a graying pan-
oramic photograph of Detroit 
bring me to tears, when a mod-
ern version of the same picture 
wouldn’t get a second glance?

NYFW: BADGLEY MISCHKA

Inspired by the 1941 film “Blood and Sand,” 

Mark Badgley and James Mischka attempted to 
bring old Hollywood glamour to New York Fash-
ion Week. Beehives and cat eyes walked down the 
runway doused in a varied combination of baroque 
ornamentation and clean silhouettes. Embellished 
details covered half of the line, while bare minimum 
covered the other. The collection was held together 
by a thin thread of inspiration, but fell apart through 
execution.

Despite the overarching “muchness” of the col-

lection, the outerwear pieces shined through. The 
loose red capes and structured tweed coats that 
adorned few of the models’ shoulders were a signifi-
cant highlight, pointing to potential outerwear piec-
es in future collections. A floor-length cream gown 
sparingly decorated with turquoise lace ornament-
ed sleeves stood out as the most successful combina-
tion of minimal and adorned in the entire line. Other 
highlights included an ornate tank top and pant 
combo and a “Mad Men”-style peplum tweed dress.

The idea that a collection could provide more 

than one inspired style is compelling, and with more 
attention to subtle differences rather than overt dis-
parities, the concept could work. Badgley Mischka 
is on to something new, which is exciting and fun to 
see on a runway where taking risks can be precari-
ous (see Kanye West’s Adidas line). Here’s an A-for-
effort on this collection and an encouraging nod in 
the hopes that the duo continues to pursue bold con-
cepts in future collections.

NYFW: THOM BROWNE

The Council of Fashion Designers of Ameri-

ca (CFDA) called Thom Browne the Menswear 
Designer of the Year in 2006, arguably the Oscar or 
Palme d’Or of fashion. Then, in 2008, GQ agreed. 
And just in 2013, CFDA decided to throw him 
another. If history should teach us anything, it’s that 
once your accolades need their own room in your 
atelier, you are permitted to take risks – weird ones, 
during Fashion Week. This year, for his F15 Collec-
tion, Browne gave us less a show and more a fune-
real future, one where the living don black and the 
dead white.

In one of the Week’s stranger exhibitions, with 

Nicki Minaj agape in the front row, Browne sent 
his models down the runway with gender-neutral 
black veils over their Burtonesque top hats, tran-
scending the dark into the sinister. High-rise lapels 
barely give the loosened ties breathing room, but 
it allowed for higher flaps and luxe ticket pockets 
that often accentuates a well-crafted suit. With the 
pockets so high (elbows and above), that leaves the 
remaining fabric to drape down uninterrupted to 
near-knee level. If families of Civil War casualties 

had the means — and the Satanism — at that time, 
they might occupy funerals with F15 Browne swag.

And, now, for the weird shit. Breeches, stock-

ings, Chelsea boots, rail-thin umbrellas, no pants at 
all, tapered driving gloves, ankle-length dresses — 
all black and all worn by men. There’s gall in what 
Browne is doing here, yet his nuanced eye erases any 
imagined disrespect he may hold for the dead. Even 
if he manages to upset the departed, they’re still 
dead, and we’re still looking.

NYFW: BAND OF OUTSIDERS

Scott Sternberg grew up a cinephile, snapping 

pictures and kicking off his professional career as an 
assistant at Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles. 
After becoming an agent and spending time in fash-
ion circles, namely with J.Crew founder Emily Scott, 
in 2003 he founded Band of Outsiders (the name-
sake taken from Godard’s 1964 film). Not unlike the 
French New Wave cinema that inspires his work, 
Sternberg has found a liminal sweet-spot between 
classics and sex appeal. Peep at his Polaroid cam-
paign with, say, Marisa Tomei, if you want to know 
what I mean — less is more as she reveals almost no 
skin yet exudes allure via Sternberg’s sharp cuts and 
calculated draping.

In January we saw his hardware store-themed 

menswear line, including hunting jackets, slim-cut 
flannels and, uncharacteristic to the designer, denim 
— a denim jumpsuit. This week, for his women’s line, 
he also ventured a bit from his elongating, tapering 
silhouettes, opting for high-slit maxis, oversized-
buttoned cardigans and Pilgrim-belted overcoats. 
He’s not trying to redefine the contours of his ideal 
consumer — nine-feet tall — but more interested in 

well-aged classics spruced up with contemporary, 
if not subtly abstract, detailing. A puffy all-denim 
parka with a coyote fur hood could thrive in the Alps 
or on Fifth Ave., its brighter indigo hue an unequivo-
cal nod to Levi’s before they shacked up with depart-
ment stores.

The best summary piece was a soft-sheen, deep-

navy bustier with matching fine-cut trousers — 
Sternberg’s auto-chic tidiness that expresses what 
everyone wants but with the humility to admit his 
derivations.

The typical sequins and party dresses appeared 

in J.Crew’s 2015 ready-to-wear collection, along-
side the less expected tailored onesies and wide 
leg trousers that also came down the runway dur-
ing Tuesday’s show. The J.Crew collection is only 
sold at select stores around the country, so what’s 
shown at Fashion Week is not necessarily what 
you may see at your typical mall.

For the autumn/winter show, though, womens-

wear designer Tom Mora created voluminous wool 
trousers and multi-colored feather minis for a line 
that differs from the traditionally preppy collections 
in the past. However, the clothes are better fit for 
creative director Jenna Lyons rather than an over-
achieving college student.

Bright yellows and blush pinks showed up in 

random pops of fur and luxurious turtlenecks. Geo-
metric designs and stripes in navy and white com-
plemented structured groutfit. Even the denim and 
sequins were revamped into maxi skirts and uncon-
ventional blazers. The coats and jackets were the 
highlight of the show, ranging from dramatic furs to 
patterned double-breasted classics.

Of course, navy sweaters over button-down 

dresses were spread throughout and a clean camel 
coat also popped up. But even the classic pumps and 
sandals featured cheetah print or eye-popping yel-
low tassels.

The collection was not a total standout, but the 

deliberate choice to include dramatic silhouettes 
and unexpected colors was an important move for 
J.Crew. The classic turtleneck has never looked so 
cool.

Slusser Gallery is a 
work of art in itself

By CATHERINE SULPIZIO

Senior Arts Editor

Rarely does the gallery itself 

merit pause. Designed with mini-
malist tendencies, the soundless, 
white and still space is designed 
to be invisible. Yet its works of art 
are guided by an organizational 
system that straddles the line 
between art and logic. The proper 
gallery setup veers neither toward 
thematic homogeny nor discord, 
instead tracing through lines of 
internal logic from one piece to 
next.

Hidden in Penny Stamps School 

of Art and Design, the Jean Paul 
Slusser 
Gallery’s 
wide, 
light-

washed space is gentle respite from 
the industrial, tunnel-like halls 
that surround it. When I walked in 
last Monday, the faculty show was 
on display. Unlike a themed exhib-
it, the faculty show is not bound 
by any unifying message — yet the 
works still gracefully orbited in 
similar systems.

I drifted by a vibrant teal tap-

estry by Sherri Smith, knit with 
the skittering, arachnid-like fig-
ures that the early 20th century 
astronomer Percival Lowell’s saw 
embedded in the surface of Mars. 
By weaving these alien figures into 
the household texture of tapestry, 
the work’s textile expanse melds 
the distant and domestic, breath-
ing new life into the dusty chroni-
cles of sci-fi and homemaking.

Perpendicular to this was a 

triptych of woodcuts by Kath-
ryn Brackett Luchs, in which a 
central plank of birch wood was 
carved into veiny simulacra of 
a tree’s texture. Bold swaths of 
ink are transposed on the bark-
like surface, and then pressed 
into reversed prints that flanked 
the original. A painting next to it 
by Nora Venturelli was similarly 
interested in vibrational records 
of originals, with its innermost 
female figure morphing into 
increasingly abstracted repre-
sentations.

This fluid effect is tricky to 

produce; after all, the gallery is a 
carefully balanced composition. 
The composer of this particular 
collection 
is 
Mark 
Nielsen, 

the exhibitions specialist for 
Penny Stamps’s three galleries, 
which 
together 
display 
a 

continuous stream of shows 
per 
year, 
including 
faculty, 

juried 
undergraduate, 
MFA 

and Integrative Project shows, 
as well as one or two shows 
featuring outside artists.

Nielsen doesn’t have a ready-

made formula for the art of exhi-
bition, but says it usually hinges 
on a killer — the killer being, in 
Nielsen’s words: “that one piece, 
that no matter what you put it 
next to, eats it alive.” Once he 
finds that place for it, “it unrav-
els the rest of the problem and it 
starts to come together.”

In our cultural milieu, the gal-

lery occupies a germane locus of 
intersection between art object 
and audience.

“The artist can spend so much 

time in their studio, agonizing to 
produce this work, yet it doesn’t 
really exist until it’s in this pub-
lic space,” Nielsen said.

And the public space alters 

the art object.

“Art can be altered so much 

by how it’s installed,” Nielsen 
said. “Imagine you had this mar-
velous painting but it was hung 
kind of crooked and the light 
wasn’t quite hung right. On the 
converse, you can take a paint-
ing that is not genius, and exhi-
bition makes a huge difference.”

Unlike 
the 
museum, 
this 

crossroads is temporary, fold-
ing itself away into the archives 
after a few months. Where the 
museum looks behind its shoul-
der for reference, the gallery is 
a polestar for the vanguard. To 
Nielsen, this emerging talent 
is the most exciting artist fea-
ture — someone who is becom-
ing a name and who will one 
day name the Slusser Gallery as 
a place they showed at in their 
early career.

And because the Slusser Gallery 

doesn’t follow the traditional for-
profit model, the gallery doesn’t 
operate under the strictures of 
commission or choosing market-
able work. Instead, the gallery is 
a resource for education, allow-
ing students to learn firsthand the 
many operations that undergird 
the pristine, white and effort-
less gallery façade. The school 
has an exhibition committee that 
includes faculty, graduate students 
and at least one undergraduate 
student.

“Part of my job is to help stu-

dents start thinking about exhibi-
tions and what it means,” Nielsen 
continues. “From painting the gal-
lery walls to calling the artists to 
deciding what the labels are going 
to say to working with a designer 
and P.R., the game moves as you 
play it.”

Beyond practical demands, the 

gallery also must register shifts 
in aesthetic ethos, such as the 
changes the recent change in the 
school’s administration brought. 
The previous dean had a liberal 
approach to art display, believing 
“too much art wasn’t a problem.”

“We used to do an undergrad 

and graduate show,” Nielsen 
recalls. “300 students would 
show up with art and I would 
have to figure out how to install 
it in three galleries.”

The new Art & Design dean, 

Gunalan Nadarajan, has a differ-
ent philosophy.

“He is interested in thinking of 

the galleries as a place of honor and 

precious resources,” Nielsen said. 
“They’re one of our biggest ways to 
show the community and potential 
students what the school is.”

Now the school does a juried 

show, selecting 50 to 60 works 
from around 100, which creates 
a more streamlined exhibition. 
The trick in organizing these 
broad shows is to create a sense of 
rhythm between the works, which 
Nielsen does by alternating medi-
ums and hanging everything on a 
centerline.

But as Nielsen noted, the good 

art still finds a way to stand out.

“Your work is going to be in 

a room with a lot of other work 
that is visually stimulating. Why 
should anyone look at yours again? 
The best art is a process where the 
artist is going out to some extreme 
edge and presents the work as evi-
dence of that disturbing or amaz-
ing experience,” he continued. 
“I’ve worked as a director, as a 
curator, as a jurist, as an exhibition 
specialist, and it comes down to if 
it is something that I want to keep 
looking at.”

Beyond just seeing, Nielsen 

views art as a conversation.

“If you’re really developing 

large bodies of work,” Nielsen said, 
“it produces a synergistic energy 
where different sides of that explo-
ration present themselves to you.”

Nielsen sees this multi-pronged 

exploration as a model for art itself. 
Creativity, to him, has referents in 
wide swaths of disciplines, from 
engineering to business to the 
humanities. In fact, this potential 
for intersectionality is the quality 
that could affirm both fine art and 
the world’s future.

“Our culture’s dependency on 

economic growth means that as 
we turn more of the natural world 
into objects, we have a situation 
where we’ve altered the composi-
tion of the earth,” Nielsen said.

“Fine art is that one aspect 

that is not concretely defined 
in our culture, and that gives it 
an incredible amount of free-
dom. These artists, who see 
the world differently, can act as 
canaries in the coal mine and 
jump forward into the future 
enough. They can have critical 
response.”

As the surrealist artist André 

Breton wrote, “The artwork has 
value only insofar as it is alive 
to reverberations of the future.”

Kanye vs. Kendrick 
for hip hop’s title belt
S

even and a half years 
ago, Kanye West erased 
50 Cent’s name off the 

A-List, beating him in a head-
to-head sales competition and 
sending 50 
into a spiraling 
fall towards 
cultural irrel-
evance. It 
might seem a 
little hard to 
imagine now, 
but in 2007, 
50 Cent was a 
dominant force 
in rap. He was 
about to release 
the follow up to The Massacre, 
one of the biggest-selling hip-hop 
records of all time, and while 
Kanye’s previous Late Registration 
was also an enormous hit, it has 
still sold over 2 million fewer units 
than The Massacre. That’s why, 
when both West’s Graduation and 
50’s Curtis were both set to come 
out on the same day in September 
2007, it was entirely conceivable 
that 50 Cent would debut at num-
ber one.

But that’s not how it went. Grad-

uation sold over 300,000 more 
copies than Curtis in their first 
week of sales, and the maximalist, 
hit-filled and critically acclaimed 
album would go on to further 
cement Kanye’s status as a top-tier 
artist and prove that rap music 
didn’t have to conform to gangsta-
rap conventions to be commercial-
ly successful.

Kanye West has made a career 

off proving himself to be bet-
ter than people expect him to be. 
When people thought he was just 
a producer, he released The Col-
lege Dropout and Late Registration 
in back-to-back years, beginning 
his career as a solo artist with two 
beloved all-time classics. With 
Graduation, he went toe-to-toe 
with a huge star and came out vic-
torious. After that, even though 
people were initially taken aback 
by his experimental use of auto-
tune and sparse electronic produc-
tion, 808s and Heartbreak went on 
to become hugely influential on 
hip hop and pop music. Then, West 
became a national pariah when he 
interrupted Taylor Swift’s accep-
tance speech at the 2009 VMAs, 
but after a time of seclusion he 
returned with his best and most 
ambitious work yet, My Beauti-
ful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Since 
MBDTF, he’s only rapped circles 
around Jay Z on the pair’s collab-
orative Watch the Throne and cre-
ated the deconstructive, abrasive 
punk-rap masterpiece Yeezus.

But this year, Kanye has pos-

sibly met his match in a young, 
intellectual artist from Compton. 
A rapper, yes, but one who prefers 
to be referred to as a writer. After 
building a solid following through 
his promising mixtapes, Kendrick 
Lamar blew the hip-hop world 
wide open with 2012’s good kid, 
m.A.A.d city, an instant-classic 
monster of a record that garnered 
universal praise and compari-
sons to rap benchmarks like Nas’s 
immortal Illmatic. Lamar has yet 
to release a follow-up, but he’s 
kept himself in the public eye with 
sparing releases, from 2013’s con-

troversy-igniting call-out “Con-
trol” to last year’s anthem of love 
“i.” Kendrick’s fearless talent and 
ambition have positioned him as 
Kanye’s number-one challenger 
for the title of “Best Rapper Alive.”

And don’t think the two aren’t 

aware of the competition. Lamar 
neglected to include Kanye on 
his shortlist of hip hop’s greats in 
“Control,” and Kanye — an artist 
who’s made a track with practi-
cally every A-List star, from Katy 
Perry to 2 Chainz — has yet to work 
with Lamar. Yes, Lamar opened 
for Kanye on The Yeezus Tour, 
but by most accounts, the two 
barely interacted. As a New York 
Times mid-tour profile of Lamar 
notes, “a mentor-mentee relation-
ship wasn’t what was expected or 
desired, and it certainly was not 
what was happening.” And some-
how, I don’t think it’s a coincidence 
that Kendrick surprise-released 
his new single, “The Blacker the 
Berry,” the day after Kanye gave 
a great new performance of his 
own new song, “Only One,” at the 
Grammys. I’m sure there’s loads 
of respect between the pair, but I 
don’t see Kanye ever inviting Ken-
drick over for dinner with Kim and 
Nori.

A genre as centered on the 

individual as hip hop lends itself 
perfectly to these kinds of rival-
ries. 2Pac vs. Biggie. Jay Z vs. Nas. 
Kanye vs. 50 Cent. Whether there’s 
actually animosity between art-
ists or not, hip-hop fans love to pit 
their favorites against each other, 
both within specific songs (who 
had the better verse on “Fuckin’ 
Problems,” Drake or Kendrick?) 
or within larger narratives (East 
Coast vs. West Coast). Rap’s roots 
are steeped in its artists making 
names for themselves through 
boasts about their own prow-
ess and disses of their opponents. 
Though straight-up call-outs in 
songs are more rare than they 
were 15 or 20 years ago, practi-
cally every rapper today will men-
tion wanting to be “the best in 
the game” multiple times in their 
songs. Kendrick proclaimed him-
self King of both the west and east 
coasts on his “Control” verse, and 
though that doesn’t cover West’s 
native Chicago, I think Kendrick 
will be angling for true national 
domination with his next release.

So with new albums looming 

from both artists, who’s going 
to win? It’s very tempting to say 
Kendrick. Rap is, after all, a young 
man’s game. We’ve seen Jay Z lose 
his fastball, Eminem struggle to 
stay relevant and many other pop-
ular artists from the last decade 
(50, Snoop Dogg, Nelly) fade into 
commercial obscurity. While I 
don’t think Kanye is suddenly just 
going to disappear, it’s difficult to 
see where exactly he can go now. 
His new work with Paul McCart-
ney has been mellower, seemingly 
more pop-oriented than his Yee-
zus material, a potential sign that 
he’s settling into artistic comfort 
(although his recent performances 
have still been barrier-breaking 
must-watch events). With a new 
family and his fashion line likely 
taking up more and more of his 
time, it’s possible that he could 
gracefully cede the spotlight to 

someone else. But at the same 
time, this is Kanye West we’re 
talking about — West is a man who 
has never once doubted his own 
abilities, and he has yet to deliver 
a record that didn’t completely 
change the rap landscape.

All of the pressure to exceed the 

bar that’s been set, then, is on Ken-
drick Lamar. Though his talent 
is undeniable, one classic album 
doesn’t yet prove that he can be the 
future of hip hop. Where exactly 
he’s going with his new material 
is uncertain, as the previews of his 
album we’ve seen so far are wildly 
divergent. Several months ago, he 
released “i,” a soulful, Isley-sam-
pling statement of love and togeth-
erness. On the final week of “The 
Colbert Report,” Kendrick served 
as Colbert’s last musical guest, 
debuting a new song that sounded 
like beat poetry and focused more 
on explicit socio-political themes, 
with a refrain of “We don’t die, we 
multiply” appearing to refer spe-
cifically to recent police brutality 
against Black people in the United 
States.

Now, with “The Blacker the 

Berry,” Kendrick has stunningly 
fired a poison-tipped arrow into 
his own heart. The song is frustrat-
ed and prideful, with undercur-
rents of self-hate. Though Lamar 
may be pointing the finger in the 
wrong direction, “The Blacker 
the Berry” carries the kind of bold 
controversial message that any 
other A-Lister would run far, far 
away from. (Well, except, perhaps, 
Kanye West.) It seems almost 
unfair to compare it to West’s 
“Only One.” Both come from 
extremely personal places, but 
“Only One” is auto-tuned singing 
is soft and lovely, and “The Blacker 
the Berry” ’s verses are unfiltered, 
venomous, righteous anger. They 
further augment the potential 
divide between the two artists.

It’s tough to get a read on 

exactly where West and Lamar 
are both trending. By virtue of 
his working with McCartney, 
it’s easy to imagine a much more 
radio-friendly upcoming record 
from Kanye, one that will posi-
tion Kendrick Lamar as the 
“realer” champion of the people, 
and therefore the better rapper. 
However, even though Kendrick 
has given us some of the most 
serious, most poetic hip hop of 
the last few years, songs like “i” 
and his old breakout hit “Swim-
ming Pools” show that he’s also 
not afraid to take his message 
to the top of the charts. To earn 
the title of “Best MC Alive” in 
2015, West and Lamar will both 
have to perform a balancing act 
between popular relevance and 
powerful content.

We’ll have to wait a little while 

longer to find out which MC will 
exit 2015 as the victor, but one 
thing is for certain: Kendrick’s 
potential is limitless, and his 
hunger is palpable. Kanye will 
have to pull out another world-
beating record if he wants to stay 
on top.

Drake as a potential contender 

in this battle. Direct your

SINGLE REVIEW

Sufjan Stevens, one of the 

most dizzyingly ambitious art-
ists, steps down for a moment 
and delivers a 
hard-hitting, 
but 
cleansing 

perspective 
on 

“No Shade in the 
Shadow of the 
Cross,” the first 
single from his 
upcoming Carrie 
& Lowell album. 
Unlike 
much 

of 
Stevens’s 

recent work, “No 
Shade” is entirely 
non-electronic. 
Instead, it’s a straightforward 
folk song, sung prettily by Ste-
vens with a slightly distort-
ed distance in his voice. His 
abstract, emotional imagery 
and melody recall acoustic sing-
er-songwriters like Vashti Bun-
yan and Elliott Smith.

“No Shade” forces you to 

take a deep breath, calming you 
with its faintly nostalgic mel-
ancholy. Though musically, the 
track doesn’t stretch itself, Ste-
vens’s voice seems to be yearn-
ing for something more. In an 
interview with Pitchfork, the 
Michigan native talked about 
his mother and stepfather, for 
whom Carrie & Lowell is named, 
saying, “I’m being explicit about 

really horrifying experiences in 
my life, but my hope has always 
been to be responsible as an art-
ist and to avoid indulging in my 
misery, or to come off as an exhi-
bitionist.” If “No Shade” is any 
indication, Stevens’s new record 
will be weighty, personal, per-
haps a little emotionally tough 
to listen to, but significantly 
rewarding.

TRAILER REVIEW

The trailer for “Mommy” 

opens with a mother’s pow-
erful declaration to prove 
love can fix all. 
Later, 
erratic 

shots track the 
yin and yang 
of 
her 
son’s 

destruction and 
her attempts to rein him in. It 
promises deeper probing into 
nature’s most fiercely inti-
mate relationship.

And all this ruined by One 

Republic’s “Counting Stars” 
blaring overtop. Paired with a 
woman’s hysterical sobs, you 
almost wonder if the movie 
is supposed to be funny (hint: 
it’s not). Trailers have mere 
minutes to snare interest, so 
everything must align under 
one concentrated vision. This 
song’s lyrics may match, but 
it’s too radio-friendly, too 
diluted by its associations 

with solo in-car karaoke and 
dance-alongs at parties to 
possibly invoke the film’s seri-
ous mood. The second song, 
Ellie Goulding’s “Anything 
Can Happen,” is less offen-
sively off-kilter, but it still 
doesn’t quite fit. The music 
choice yanks “Mommy” com-
pletely away from its thematic 
course, toppling what once 

would have been a successful 
trailer.

Perhaps the intent behind 

using popular music was to 
connect with a wider audi-
ence, but let’s remember that 
this is a film shot in a one-
to-one square ratio. It knows 
it’s not a blockbuster. So why 
doesn’t its soundtrack?

By ADAM DEPOLLO

Managing Arts Editor

When Tarfia Faizullah fell 

in love with poetry, she wasn’t 
enamored with the fictive beauty 
of metaphors or the craftsmanship 
that goes into forming perfectly 
metered 
verse. 
Rather, 
she 

was entranced by its ability to 
illuminate the world around us 
on its own terms — in her case, 
literally so.

“I really loved Emily Dickinson 

when I was growing up,” she said. 
“I was sitting in the library and 
reading her poem ‘A Certain Slant 
of Light’ and it was, I think, early 
afternoon, and there was a slant 
coming through the blinds onto 
the page and I was like ‘Whoa! 
That’s a certain slant of light, that’s 
amazing.’”

She was also fascinated by 

the act of transcription, by the 
possibility 
of 
having 
others 

speak through her voice and her 
pen. In its earliest incarnation, 
that fascination looked a lot like 
plagiarism.

“I 
didn’t 
understand 
that 

writing 
something 
out, 
like 

copying it into my notebook and 
showing it to somebody, isn’t the 
same thing as writing your own 
original composition,” she said. 
“I got caught by my teacher, and 
at first he was like ‘Wow, you’re 
such a good poet,’ and then he was 
like ‘These are from that book that 
you’ve been copying poems from,’ 
and I was like ‘Yeah,’ and he said 
that wasn’t the same as writing 
your own poems.”

But Faizullah has since learned 

the difference, and her first book 
of poetry, “Seam,” might be the 
long-delayed product of those 
early studies in the often fuzzy 
lines between art and life, made 
all the more visible in the case of 
translators and transcribers.

Published 
by 
Southern 

Illinois University Press in 2014, 
“Seam” is built around a series of 
interviews Faizullah conducted 
with 
birangona, 
women 
who 

were raped by Pakistani soldiers 
in the Bangladesh Liberation 
War of 1971. The collection was 
published while she studied there 
as a Fulbright scholar in 2010. The 
poetry — formally diverse and 
devastatingly immediate — does 
much more than simply recount 
the 
stories 
she 
heard 
while 

traveling and meeting women 
in Bangladesh. Her interview 

subjects disagree with her, refuse 
to answer her questions or, rather, 
respond to the questions they want 
to hear. She interrogates herself 
as an interviewer, as a translator 
of the birangona’s experiences 
and as a Bangladeshi-American 
steeped in the same tragedies – but 
at a distance, as in “Interviewer’s 
Note, vi.”: “I want / that darkness 
she stood against / to be yards of 
violet velvet my mother / once 
cut me a dress from. Rewind. 
Play. / Rewind.” And, ultimately, 
it’s an opportunity for Faizullah 
to reflect on, learn from and take 
pride in her own work.

“Sometimes I feel that I could 

have done it better, and sometimes 
I feel that I haven’t told as full of a 
story as I could have. But mainly 
I’m just proud of it. I’m just proud 
of what it has been able to do – just 
really surprised by what it has 
been able to do,” she said.

Since the publication of “Seam,” 

the larger poetry community has 
also recognized what Faizullah 
and her work can do. The book won 
a number of prestigious awards 
for 
first 
poetry 
publications, 

including the Great Lakes Colleges 
Association New Writers Award 
and the Crab Orchard First Book 
Award, and her other works as a 
poet and academic has won her 
a Pushcart Prize, a Ploughshares 
Cohen Award, a Dorothy Sargent 
Rosenberg prize and a number 
of 
scholarships, 
grants 
and 

fellowships. 
She 
collaborates 

with composers, rappers and 
photographers, 
works 
as 
an 

editor for a number of notable 
publications, regularly performs at 
poetry slams and formal readings, 
and currently finds herself at the 
University, serving as the Nicholas 
Delbanco Visiting Professor of 
Poetry as part of the Helen Zell 
Writers’ Program. But Faizullah 
is first and foremost a poet, and 
she hasn’t taken the time since 
she finished “Seam” to rest on her 
laurels.

“I just kept writing the whole 

time,” she said. “I have hundreds 
of poems that will probably never 
see the light of day, because for 
me, writing poetry is just a daily 
practice. And I don’t mean the 
actual act of sitting down and 
drafting – I just mean sort of 
moving through the world with 
the eyes of a writer.”

The name of her next book, 

“Register of Eliminated Villages,” 
derives from a list of destroyed 

Kurdish villages and is set to be 
published by Greywolf Press in 
2017. In it, Faizullah plans to return 
to the themes of global violence she 
explored in “Seam.”

“I’m really fascinated by human 

psychology,” she said. “And I’m 
really 
fascinated 
particularly 

by how we respond to violence, 
how we contain it, and how our 
awareness of such broad violence 
all over the world, as well as what 
we see in our daily lives or hear 
about – how that affects us both 
emotionally 
and 
intellectually. 

How do we see ourselves? How do 
we see other people through the 
lens of the possibility of being able 
to do harm.”

She 
considers 
poetry 

particularly well-suited to discuss 
highly charged topics like the 
violence she addresses in her own.

“Poetry is really magical in 

that it’s not prose and it’s not song 
— it’s recitation and it’s oratory,” 
she said. “There’s a reason why 
we think of our politicians as 
orators. And I think poetry is an 
oratory tradition. So I feel like, just 
formally speaking, it’s built to be 
able to convey complex ideas.”

But the discussions Faizullah 

engages in through her poetry 
don’t serve to simply reframe 
issues in an aesthetic light. I asked 
her what she thought about a 
line from one of her first favorite 
poets, Emily Dickinson: “I dwell in 
Possibility.”

“I think one of the most 

powerful things about being an 
artist is the awareness you develop 
of the world as a series of infinite 
possibilities,” she said, “and so 
your life becomes about choices 
and about discernment. I think the 
awareness of those choices can lead 
you to take risks that you wouldn’t 
otherwise, which can lead you 
to 
understanding 
something 

about yourself that you wouldn’t 
otherwise 
– 
understanding 

something about your place in the 
world, too, I think.”

Her poetry, then, transcribes 

and 
expands 
upon 
violence, 

suffering and self-discovery in 
order to present an alternative, 
to show us that, even if we can’t 
forget, the next day need not 
be the same as the last. It gives 
us the same advice she hears 
in Dickinson, the same advice 
she gives to her creative writing 
students at the University.

“Yeah, I encourage them to 

‘dwell in possibility,’ too,” she said.

MUSIC VIDEO REVIEW

The day before Valentine’s 

Day, leading up to the release 
of the music 
video 
for 

“Style,” Taylor 
Swift posted a 
series of crimi-
nally 
short 

teases of it on 
her Instagram. 
They featured 
a moody Swift 
with 
various 

naturescapes 
projected onto 
her body, devoid of sound. 
Right away, it was clear that, 
visually speaking, the video 
wasn’t going to be what we 
expected. But the same could 
have been said about her video 
for “Blank Space,” which hard-
ly fed our expectations (and 
hardly let us down). So I held 
onto the hope that, in the con-
text of the full video, it would 
all make sense. As it turns out, 
that was wishful thinking.

The video for “Style” is 

completely out of sync with 
the song itself in terms of 
tone, rhythm and aesthetic. 
Whereas the song builds upon 
a pulsating ’80s guitar synth 
leading up to an exuberantly 
brilliant chorus of imagery, 
the video throws palpable 
images out through a drab — 
yet, technically pretty — lace-
draped window. What we get 
is a slow-moving, barefoot 
stroll through a fog-filled for-
est as we watch Swift play 
with shards of a shattered mir-
ror that reflect a shirtless ex-
lover.

“Style” is arguably the best 

song on 1989. It uses timeless 
images of romance and gives 
them a chic, mysterious twist. 
It complicates a straightfor-
ward, yet doomed romance 
and gives it a spark of life. 
Why doesn’t its accompanying 
music video take advantage of 
that? Sure, Taylor’s got that 
red lipstick thing that we like, 

and her anonymous love inter-
est (briefly) wears a white 
t-shirt à la the song’s lyrics, 
but that James Dean daydream 
look in his eyes? Hardly appar-
ent. Long hair slicked back? 
Nope, not happening.

I’m not saying I hoped the 

“Style” video would be a literal 
interpretation of the song, say, in 
the same vein as Miley Cyrus’s 
“Wrecking Ball” was, but it 
should have been higher energy. 

It should have injected the song, 
which I’ve had on repeat since 
October, with some extra flare 
that would have made it just as 
infectious as it was the first time 
we heard it.

Taylor Swift has been on 

a hot streak throughout the 
1989 era. But, with this video, 
that streak comes crashing 
down. She’ll come back from it, 
though. She does every time.

I’ll admit this right off the bat: I read the book before seeing the 

film. I’ll also admit this: I passed out twice in the theater. Does that say 
something about the movie? What was 125 minutes felt like an eternity. 
Lemme break it down.

Firstly, I need to speak to whoever adapted this screenplay. Who are 

you? The innuendos, the symbolism – I don’t think I stopped to breathe, 
I was laughing so hard. Where is the best comedy nomination for this? 
It tickled me more than Christian tickled Ana. Maybe this is a testament 
to my maturity. Each time Christian held out his hand and told Ana to 
“come” – when he whipped out the pea(cock) feather during a serious, 
steamy session – I just couldn’t keep it in (the laughter, I mean).

Anyway, the film just tried too hard (haha) to be sophisticated and 

hyper-artistic. “Fifty Shades” needs to accept that it will never be an 
Academy-worthy film, and it doesn’t need to be such a drama queen 
about it. The dialogue, the delivery, the juxtaposition of dark and light 
– everything dripped with drama and desperate symbolism. Every glare 
pierced through our souls, every touch brought shivers down our spines. 
I died lactose intolerant from the amount of cheese in this film.

What’s the opposite of a sexual awakening? Sexual deadening? 

Sexual closing? All I know is that, after driving through an arctic tun-
dra on Valentine’s Day afternoon and maneuvering my place in line 
so I could say “uh, same thing please” to the ticket-seller instead of 
“uh, the movie with all the weird sex, please,” “Fifty Shades” seemed 
like it was going to be the fun kind of trashy. That was for the first 20 
minutes. Then they had to start having sex, and things got so absurdly 
dull that Buzzed fell asleep in one of the (admittedly very comfortable, 
if a bit squeaky) theater seats next to me. While the fact that Dakota 
Johnson fully actualizes a character who is literally Bella Swan with 
an English degree is quite admirable, Jamie Dornan’s robotic Edward 
Cullen somnambulates through his scenes and does little more than 
moodily play the piano and stare at Johnson’s butt while she dances 
to “Beast of Burden.” The most intriguing thing about him isn’t the 
burn marks on his chest, but rather how the hell he’s so freakishly 
clean-shaven (maybe androids can’t grow hair). Why is he tickling her 
so much? Why are the sex scenes so male gaze-y? Can I call in a friend 
with no journalism experience when I can’t do an interview? (Ignore 
that last one, Jen.) Those were all my questions, but the film’s only 
salient question was asked by Johnson about two-thirds in: “What are 
butt plugs?” If this is the sex adults dream of, I’m fine with never get-
ting past first base again.
