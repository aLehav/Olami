36.2 percent of
registered voters
in precints around
campus voted
By PETER SHAHIN
Daily Staff Reporter
The old adage that history
is made by those who show up
may not be true at the Univer-
sity.
Despite high youth voter
turnout across the country,
Ann Arbor's student-dominat-
ed areas turned out in numbers
well below the national youth
average on Election Day.
In regions surrounding
Central Campus and the two
precincts including the resi-
dential areas of North Cam-
pus, the average turnout rate
was 36.2 percent. Ballots were
cast by 10,110 people in these
areas out of an overall popula-
tion of 27,936 registered voters.
The student-area turnout paled
in comparison to the overall
Washtenaw County turnout of
64.5 percent.

Ward 4, precinct 1, which
votes in The Michigan Union,
had the highest percentage
turnout in the student areas of
AnnArbor with participationof
43.43 percent of the precincts's
registered voters. In cor'tast,
Ward 2, precinct 3 had thesw-
est turnout with only 28.74 per-
cent of the region's voters going
to the polls. These figures do
not include students that may
have voted absentee for locales
outside of Ann Arbor, butthose
students were also not included
in the overall number of regis-
tered voters.
On Wednesday, The Center
for Information and Research
on Civic Learning and Engage-
ment, a researinorganization
based at Tufts University in
Massachusetts, announced that
exit polls on Tuesday revealed
that 49 percent of people under
the age of 30 voted this year.
This number is on par or slight-
ly below 2008's estimated min-
imum turnout, of an estimated
48.3 percent, which eventually
rose to 52 percent according to
CIRCLE.

By KATIE SZYMANSKI

In an effort to promote cam-

is opting to temporarily put down

their solo cups and volunteer to
assist students in need on Foot-
ball Saturdays.
The Michigan Ambassadors
Program, comprised of students
dedicated to advocating for
safety during football tailgates
and other high-risk events, was
pioneered last year through Uni-
versity Greek Life and is now
working with the Student Ath-
letic Advisory Council and LSA

Student Government to monitor
tailgates and provide safety tips
to partygoers.
Engineering senior Nathan
Hamet, the executive vice

"The event (was) created to

Program in the Environment
- d icelebrates 10th anniversary

Speakers, campus
events highlight
growth of program
By CHELSEA HOEDL
Daily StaffReporter
Though it may not be cel-
ebrating with 'paper hats or
streamers, one University pro-
gram is celebrating its toth
birthday this year.
The University's Program in
the Environment - an under-
graduate academic major
offered jointly by LSA and the
School of Natural Resources
and the Environment - is mark-
ing its 10th anniversary with
a variety of events throughout
the academic year starting in
September and runningthrough
April 2013. PitE is an interdisci-
plinary undergraduate concen-
tration program that addresses
environmental issues in areas
of natural science, social science
and humanities perspectives.
The program also offers minors
in the environment, sustainabil-
ity and global change.
PitE kicked off its anniversa-
ry celebration with a barbeque
on Sept. 7, which was attended
by PitE students, alumni, staff
and faculty, and featured a guest
concert by local performer Joe
Reilly. The program also hosted
an alumni tailgate over home-
coming weekend.

One signature part of the pro-
gram this year is implementa-
tion of a mentorship program
for current PitE students. PitE
held an initial event on Oct. 25
to initiate its Building Environ-
mental Awareness and Rela-
tionships program, which pairs
PitE students and SNRE student
mentors. To celebrate its 10-year
anniversary, PitE has also been
working to connect current stu-
dents with program graduates
to encourage them to plan their
future careers, according to PitE
program coordinator Kimberly
Smith.
"We have created a series of
workshops for students to start
thinking about how they can pro-
mote themselves and how to start
thinking about their experience
as PitE students," Smith said,
Upcoming events to celebrate
the anniversary include a "Grad
Schools and Gap Years" work-
shop on Nov. 28 and a lecture
with Chris Jordan - a Seattle-
based artist who's work reflects
modern environmental issues
- that the program is co-spon-
soring with the Penny W. Stamps
Distinguished Speaker series on
Nov. 15.
In February, the program
will host a Change Agents event
intended to connect art and
environmental change, with
guests ranging from photogra-
phers to storytellers to journal-
ists, who will lead workshops on
how they use their mediums to
effect change.

Smith said PitE has grown
more than expected in the past
10 years, adding that the origi-
nal estimate for program par-
ticipants was about 50 students,
but the program now boasts
about 600 students. PitE has
also added several courses to
the curriculum in the past three
years that cover topics such as
sustainability and society, war
and the environment, and sus-
tainable cities.
Students can earn either a
Bachelor of Science or a Bach-
elor of Arts degree, depending
on their course choices. PitE
concentrators are also required
to fulfill a practical experience
requirement, in which they
are expected to gain hands-on
experience with issues related
to their academic courses.
PitE is also responsible for
encouraging students to apply
for the Udall Scholarship, a
national scholarship awarded
to students from various majors
who have expressed a commit-
ment to career paths related to
the environment.
Engineering senior Sita Syal
won this year's award, and said
it has opened up numerous
opportunities for her.
"We did a lot of professional
development (within PitE) and
just getting to know each other
and networking," Syal said.
"That's the best part. That and
being around all these other
students like you who want to
change the world."

NEWS BRIEFS
DETROIT
Bing appoints two
Detroit assistant
police chiefs
DETROIT (AP) - Detroit
Mayor Dave Bing has appointed
two new assistant chiefs as part of
a restructuring of the city's police
department.
Janice Butler was lured out
of retirement and named Thurs-
day to become assistant chief for
administration, while deputy
chief Paul Welles has been moved
up to assistant chief for patrol and
investigation.
Police commissioners still have
to approve the appointments.
Commander James White also
has been moved up to deputy
chief, while two deputy chiefs
under ex-chief Ralph Godbee have
been reassigned.
Godbee resigned last month
after a female subordinate
revealed the two had been in a
sexual relationship.
Bing says 26 officers will be
promoted to sergeant, lieutenant
and inspector ranks.
LOS ANGELES
Anti-Muslim film-
maker imprisoned
for violating parole
The California man behind an
anti-Muslim film that led to vio-
lence in many parts of the Middle
East was sentenced Wednesday
to a year in federal prison for pro-
bation violations in an unrelated
matter, then issued a provocative
statement through his attorney.
The sentence was the result of a
plea bargain between lawyers for
Mark Bassely Youssef and federal
prosecutors. Youssef admitted in
open court that he had used sev-
eral false names in violation of
his probation order and obtained
a driver's license under a false
name. He was on probation for a
bank fraud case.
Shortly after Youssef left the
courtroom, his lawyer, Steven
Seiden, came to the front steps of
the courthouse and told reporters
his client wanted to send a mes-
sage.
"The one thing he wanted me to
tell all of you is President Obama
may have gotten Osama bin
Laden, but he didn't kill the ideol-
ogy," Seiden said.

SOPHIA, Bulgaria
Archaeologists
discover Thracian
golden jewelry
Archaeologists say they have
unearthed an almost 2,400-year-
old golden hoard in an ancient
Thracian tomb in northern Bul-
garia.
The treasure was found on
Thursday near the village of
Sveshtari, 400 kilometers (250
miles) northeast of Sofia, team
leader Diana Gergova said.
She said that among the arti-
facts, dating back to the end of
the fourth or the beginning of
the third century B.C., were gold
jewelry and applications for horse
trappings, a tiara with reliefs of
lions and fantasy animals, as well
as four bracelets and a ring.

TRANSIT
From Page 1A
members Briere, Taylor, Higgins,
Kunselman and Hieftje spon-
sored the resolution to back away
from the plan.
Council members expressed
their frustration that other com-
munities rejected the project
after ongoing efforts to push it
forward to fruition.
"This whole effort basically
spent a lot of money to basically
bring us back to the beginning,
and that's unfortunate," Kunsel-
man said. "I'm glad that we are
doing this tonight because it's
important that the Council that
created this effort is also going to
close it. The good news is that we
will be able to start fresh."
Councilmember Hoenke
said he was upset that the other
municipalities rejected the
authority, which he thought
would have been a benefit to the
communities.
"I'm a little disappointed in
the townships," Hoenke said.
"I think a countywide transit
authority would have added a lot
to our community ... I think this
going outside of what we hope."
Lumm retorted, claiming that
communities need to make deci-
sions that are in their best inter-
est.
"You have to trust them to do
what is important to the resi-
dents," Lumm said.
Councilmember Briere said
the dissolution of the current
transit authority would leave

board members from other com-
munities without a position since
the citywide authority does not
allow for members that are not
residents. She said the Council
should decide whether to include
non-residents or not.
"It has to be one or the other,"
Briere said. "Either we want the
members of the AATA board to'
be residents of Ann Arbor or we
want to open it up to other juris-
dictions too."
f Mayor Hieftje said this con-
versation wouldn't be the last on
public transit.
"This is not so much the end of
this discussion of expanded tran-
sit but a restart and a reboot of
this discussion including the local
partners," Hiefje said.
During public commentary
before the vote, two members of
the Washtenaw Transit Author-
ity - a commission of Washtenaw
county residents advocating for
increased transit - asked the
Council to continue support for
the transit program.
Carolyn Lusch, a member
of the Washtenaw Partners for
Transit, said though she agreed
that the plan should be well
planned, the county is in desper-
ate need of immediate and effec-
tive transit options.
"We need to keep moving for-
ward deliberately," Lusch said.
"The strong support for the con-
cept of transit is a first step. But
you can't ride a concept home
from your shift ... We need buses
run frequently, efficiently and to
allthe placesweneed themtogo."
AATA CEO Michael Ford said

in an AATA press release that the
authority will continue to discuss
means of countywide transit in
the future.
"Efforts to extend the benefits
of transit to a greater number of
Washtenaw County residents
will continue," Ford said in the
release. "This issue is a high pri-
ority for our region's economic
vitality and growth."
Ford added that the authority
will continue to work with sur-
rounding communities including
Ann Arbor, SalineYpsilanti, Pitts-
field Township, Scio Township,
Superior Township and Dexter.
AATA will also review existing
services and costs to ensure its
history of strong fiscal steward-
ship is not disrupted, according to
Ford. The review will determine
the feasibility of continuing to
provide the services implemented
as part of AATA's initial invest-
ment under its Five-Year Transit
Program.
Ford said some new services
that may not be feasible without
funding from Council include
the doubled frequency of week-
day service on the #4 Washtenaw
route, AirRide, a bus that runs
between Ann Arbor and Detroit
Metro Airport, ExpressRide
routes connecting Ann Arbor
with Canton and Chelsea and
Expanded NightRide service area
eastward to Ypsilanti.
"We understand these services
enjoywidespreadpopularitywith
AATA passengers," said Ford.
"We hope to avoid any reduction
or elimination of AATA opera-
tions."

VOTE
From Page 1A
on average, voters under 30
favored President Barack Obama
by a 24-percent margin over Mitt
Romney. The 49-percent overall
turnout was the second high-
est, behind only 2008, since the
center started recording exit poll
data in 1996. However, the num-
ber may rise as contested and late
ballots are counted in the coming
weeks.
Had Romney won even half
the youth vote, according to the
report's analysis, he would have
won the Electoral College and
the presidency.
Speaking on Tuesday night,
Political Science Prof. Michael
Heaney said this election
couldn't match the spirit of the
2008 campaign, and the excite-
ment was more of a reversion to
the mean.
"I would say that this was
probably a typical election in
terms of excitement, but it was
clearly less than 2008 when
there was an exceptionally high
level of excitement,"- Heaney
said. "This was typical - perhaps
a little bit below average."
According to exit poll data col-
lected by the Associated Press,
Romney won the white vote

59 percent to 39 percent, while
Obama carried all other racial
groups surveyed. Across the
nation, Obama carried 50 per-
cent of college-educated voters
and 51 percent of non-college
educated voters. Romney had
the support of 48 percent and 47
percent of those respective cat-
egories.
Aaron Kall, the director of the
University Debate Team, said on
Tuesday night that Obama's suc-
cess largely relied on high turn-
out from minority and younger
voters.
"The turnout was the most
important thing - there was a
high percent of turnout among
the African-American and Lati-
no vote, and also the young vote,"
Kall said. "In some of those cat-
egories the turnout was even
higher than in 2008."
Kall added that Republican-
backed efforts to enforce or cre-
ate new voter identification laws
in several states motivated many
minorities and youth voters to
exercise their voting rights in
response to these proposals.
"I think some of these actions
backfired and caused a larger
turnout in 2012," Kall said.

Delgado served
as a-Carnegie
Mellon trustee and
donated generously
EL PASO, Texas (AP) - In
public, Marco Antonio Delgado
was a philanthropist, a promi-
nent El Paso businessman and a
trustee at Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity. But secretly, investiga-
tors say, he was trying to launder
more than half a billion dollars
for a Mexican drug cartel.
Delgado pleaded not guilty
Thursday in El Paso to federal
charges that accuse him of con-
spiring to launder $600 million
of a cartel's drug profits from July
2007 through December 2008.
Homeland Security Investiga-
tions said he was linked to a car-
tel based in Guadalajara, Mexico.
Ifconvicted,the marriedfather
faces up to 20years in prison.
A recently unsealed indict-
ment doesn't provide details on
how Delgado planned to carry
out the scheme, though details
could be revealed during a bond
hearipg Wednesday, when pros-
ecutors try to convince a judge to
keep Delgado in jail.
His wife and son declined
comment after Thursday's hear-
ing, as did his attorneys. Delgado
was arrested last week.
Records show that Delgado

was an active philanthropist in
the El Paso area, donating to the
Symphony Orchestra, and was a
member of the boards of educa-
tional charities.
Delgado also gave Carn-
egie Mellon, his alma mater,
$250,000 to establish a fellow-
ship in 2003. He later became a
trustee of the prestigious uni-
versity in Pittsburgh, a post that
allowed him to rub elbows with
top executives of large compa-
nies such as GM, USB Wealth
Management and Oracle.
University spokesman Ken
Walters confirmed that Delgado
was.a trustee from 2006 through
mid-2012, saying: "I wish it was
someone else."
By his own account, Delgado
even dabbled in Mexican politics.
A biography recently pulled from
the university's website said Del-
gado took leave from his profes-
sional activities to join Mexican
President-elect Enrique Pena
Nieto's campaign in early 2012,
and that he was currently part of
his transition team.
Eduardo Sanchez, a spokes-
man for the transition team, said
they had never heard of Delgado
and pointed to the group's web-
site, which doesn't list Delgado
as a member. Such teams are
tasked by the president-elect to
meet with current officials and
gather information to assure
a smooth transition between
administrations.

FROM T HE DA LY
Bring students togrether
Encourage international/domestic integration
he University boasts one of the most diverse student bodies in
the country. We rank eighth nationally in the enrollment of
international students, with more than 5,000 enrolled. While
this is a remarkable achievement that our University takes pride in,
until now, we were among only a few universities in the nation that did
not have an international student society to represent its large inter-
national population. This year, the Central Student Government has
supported an initiative to address this issue driven by international
students themselves. Keshav Reddy, with support from CSG and the
International Center, has founded the Michigan International Stu-
dents Society. Even University administration has welcomed MISS and
extended support. Although this initiative is something to applaud, it
must not be limited in scope.

VANESSA RYCHLINSKI(VIWP
Philosopher and social critic Ber-
trand Russell once said the "whole
problem with the world is that fools
and fanatics are always so certain of
themselves, and wiser people are so
full of doubts." If I was wiser, or brav-
er, maybe I wouldn't have voted at all.
It was Election Day and I was star-
ing down at my ballot in horror. I
had to change who I would choose
for president. In a moment of utter
conflict, I debated what to do - to-
vote for Mitt Romney or for Presi-
dent Barack Obama. I seriously con-
sidered just finishing my ballot and
inserting it in the machine as-is. I
rationalized, I argued with myself -
either way I chose, I'd feel like an ass.
I wentback to the woman behind the
computer at the entrance.
"I accidentally filled in the wrong
bubble," I said, smilingsheepishly.
The woman nodded curtly, re-
swiped my driver's license and cor-
rected my registration card.
She instructed me to write the
word "spoiled" in large letters across
my ballot. Given my growing disgust
with the whole business, this was
indescribably fitting. I walk back to
the booths still feeling like an ass,but
at least armed with the knowledge
I'd finally picked my poison.
A 1940 Columbia University study
published in a book called "The
People's Choice" is often cited as the
sociologicalbranchofthe three main
studies of voting behavior. Most peo-
ple either align with the politics of
their parents or drift to the middle
instead. As the daughter of staunch,
starched white-collar Republicans
and the granddaughter of old-school,
blue-collar Democrats, I'm part of
the latter. But if my hesitation at the
polls can be attributed to a mere iden-
tity crisis, then many of our peers are
conscientious objectors rather than
politically bipolar.
Jessica Jary, a pre-med student at
Michigan State University, expressed
frustration with the process of voting
for president, citing dissatisfaction
with both candidates as the reason.

) clear choice

Her choice: no one.
"I don't know how people are so
sure what the right (choice) is," she
said. "I feel like I could have a Ph.D in
economics, foreign policy and health
care and still not know."
After becoming as informed as I
could, I still wrestled with my basic
political ideology. It's not the fed-
eral " government's responsibility to
force or impede social change. People
should be able to generally do what
they please, but only as long as oth-
ers aren't hurt in the process and
religious groups aren't forced to vio-
late their principles. I wasn't worried
about my reproductive rights - Roev.
Wade isn't going anywhere, people -
but I was worried about finding a job
as a humanities major and becoming
an heir to a cool trillion-and-then-
some national debt. But then again,
since I'm never gonna be a Vanderbilt,
I'm not going have to pay much in the
way of taxes, anyway, right?
Such emotional biases were preva-
lent among voters in this election.
Several articles, including one from
the Wall Street Journal, claim that
President Obama was re-elected by
Hispanics, African-Americans, young
people and women - which suggests
that each of these demographics felt
the President would do more for them.
So much for thatKennedy paraphrase
Obama invoked duringhis acceptance
speech. Ask not what your country
can do for you, indeed.
But what's wrong, exactly, with
choosing a president based on a real
or imagined personal connection?
What's wrong is that not everyone
chooses their political identity based
on their sex or race. Many people are
searching for other commonalities in
a presidential candidate, and aren't
finding them: non-voters make up
the largest voting bloc in the United
States at a whopping 40 percent.
Barry Belmont, an Engineering
graduate student, didn't vote for
president due to a disagreement with
democracy.
"It binds people to decisions they

had no part in making, and with
which they may disagree with," he
said.
Paul Jackson, a senior studying
political science at Northwestern
University, called Obama's re-elec-
tion "America ducking a bullet for a
beating instead."
"I had people hitting me up saying
'If you don't vote, you're voting for
Romney' and a number of other mor-
alistic and less pragmatic reasons for
why Ihad to vote," he said.
"Even though it didn't matter
because Obama was going Democrat
allornothingfromthestart.Thevery
fact that no one even thought about
that ... shows how much they were
actually thinking about the mechan-
ics and circumstances of electoral
politics in our feeble 'democracy."'
"It is that our democracy is ulti-
mately coercive that I have a problem
with it," Belmont pointed out.
"(There's) no way to say, 'No,' to
it. Where freedom and liberty truly
begin is at a person's ability to say no.
In being able to say, I have gone this
farbutIwillgo no furtherone actual-
lyhas the freedom to controltheirlife,
(which is) the right of every person."
Saying "no" isn't a viable form
of democratic participation, and it
points to a larger problem: The dual-
ity of our party system means that
one man is always out. "Majority
rule" is monopolistic - about half
get their way at the expense of the
rest. Like a true-or-false question on
an elementary school test, when it
comes to politics you're either com-
pletely right, or completely wrong
- the loser is automatically invalid,
the winner beholden to no one but
the side who elected him, and usually
not even that. I look forward to the
next election,. in which hopefully I
can choose compassionately, but also
logically, for those of us in the middle
that refuse to be hoodwinked - and
sometimes refuse to choose at all.

While it's commendable that such steps
are being taken toward making Ann Arbor a
welcome refuge for its thousands of interna-
tionals, MISS needs to make sure the entire
student body can benefit from cross-cultural
integration. CSG has created an ambassa-
dors board consisting of representatives from
various 'national and ethnic organizations
on campus to discuss problems facing inter-
national students. It intends to help increase
funding for study abroad and plans to stream-
line funding for minority student organiza-
tions, among other functions.
MISS is the necessary focal point by which
international students are brought together.
With it, they can solve the unique issues they
face and can more easily increase their prom-
inence on campus by pooling resources and
organizing joint cultural events.
University rhetoric tells us that everyone
can find a club or organization that suits him
or her. While this does emphasize the fact
that we're a diverse student body, it doesn't
do enough to encourage students to leave
their comfort zones. The value of our diver-
sity is compromised when minority students

from different countries and backgrounds
don't interact with the rest of the student
body.
One example of this is the University's
decision to have a different orientation day
for international students. Separation doesn't
allow for interaction between students of all
backgrounds. The University and societies
like MISS need to recognize this and bring
the entire student body closer together.
The University's adminiastration hasn't
shown commitment to this cause. Our lack of
an international society in the past and the
fact that international students themselves
had to undertake the founding of such a soci-
ety proves this. While it may be easier for
administrative and organizational purposes
to have a separate international student ori-
entation, such measures by our University do
very little to encourage interaction between
international and domestic students. Future
policies need to ensure that our diversity does
not just look good on paper, but also that our
students should actually be able to reap the
benefits of being among people from more
than 120 countries around the world.

Nestled in the heart of a cultur-
ally rich and active. local community,
the University of Michigan's goals
seem to mirror the objectives of local
Ann Arbor. The city is a buzzing hub
of innovation start-up entrepre-
neurial enterprises, cutting edge
technology and research firms seem
to make up the nucleus of Ann Arbor
economy. Because such endeavors
prove costly, efficiency seems to be a
priority amongst local civilians, a pri-'
macy that's reflected in their business
approaches. Efficiency can be achieved
on a variety levels: capital allocation,
minimal time or energy expenditure
and strategic business structures that
minimize costs and boost profits. Such
efficiency standards can be met with
numerous approaches. However, Ann
Arbor companies seem to equate effi-
ciency with "green" sustainability and
consider local options and careful envi-
ronmental practices to reach the bar.
While residing in Ann Arbor for four
years, I noticed incentives for reducing
waste around the city. Many food busi-
nesses receive base ingredients from
local farmers and donate leftovers to
the homelesspopulation. Local farmers
markets are highly publicized and well
frequentedby students and locals alike.
Clothing and product drives reallocate
excess, and a noticeable shift toward
biodegradable materials for dispos-
able products has become widespread
in University and local businesses. A
new wave of businesses promoting
increased accessibility to public trans-
portation has also emerged. By means
of more expansive bus routes and ini-
tiatives to provide larger-capacity cabs,
Ann Arbor. moves more people and
burns less fuel. Within the commu-
nity, there's a consistent biking popu-
lation and, more recently, an emerging
skateboard culture. Governmental
regulations have rejected proposals for
increasing parking accessibility, and
this has been proven to deter individu-
als from driving, which is a positive for
fuel conservation.
Additionally, the physical layout of
Ann Arbor makes walking or alterna-
tive transportation an easy, viable and
reasonable option, along with the con-
struction of new residence halls, co-ops
and apartment buildings on Central
Campus - bringing people closer in
proximity to their destinations. The
"dual" suburban life in Ann Arbor
provides the perfect marketplace for
local and student businesses to test
new ideas and receive rapid feedback
from the student community, which
strives for "efficiency" in all sectors of
life, as academia proves rather grueling

and time-consuming. Essentially, Ann
Arbor makes it easy to be environmen-
tally conscious by providing the means
to promote desired actions.
The "green" movement swept
through Ann Arbor like a storm, and
the Ross School of Business proved
to be Ann Arbor's jewel. An entirely
"green" building, constructed by
using preexisting recycled materials,
it boasted goals of modernity while
achieving energy and water efficiency
through design innovation. Through
carefully crafted and creative design
practices, the functioning building has
increased profitability, saved funds and
resources and reduced the negative
environmental impacts of development
on the surrounding community. Mod-
ern and energy-efficient: It's possible.
Additionally, Ann Arbor has
employed solar-powered parking
meters throughout the city and recep-
tacles for recycling next to virtually
every waste repository. Participatingin
this movement becomes inevitable and,
as a result, students and locals develop
sustainable habits.
My fascination with urban living
and sustainability was redefined when
I moved north of downtown Chicago.
Generally speaking, subways and buses
are the predominate mode of trans-
portation for many city dwellers. As a
graduate student, it's an option to pur-
chase an unlimited public transporta-
tion card for six months of accessibility.
Purchasing a pass was a necessity for
me because my proximity from school
wasn't conducive for walking. My com-
mute on the subway has opened my eyes
to the amount of fuel, finances, energy
and time allotment that is being saved
per person. Calculate $2.50 per one-way
ticket, the price of a car, gas, parkingand
time in the context of the city and your
result is astounding. Chicago utilizes.
public transportation in a way unlike
most other big cities, by utilizing both
above ground and underground subway
transport. By doubling the expansive
public transportation network, Chicago
transports more people and employs
more individuals to service and main-
tain the tracks and trains. Read: Public
transportation is quick,efficient, expan-
sive, and arguably entertaining.
Illinois also provides a number of
incentives for renewable efforts. These
opportunities are available for com-
mercial, industrial, residential, educa-
tional and institutional interests,, and
help to further the employment and
adoption of new technology and envi-
ronmentally beneficial practices. Some
of these practices involve: "green"
building designs, geothermal heat

pumps, solar space and water heaters,
photovoltaics, hydroelectricity, LED
lighting, renewable fuels and biomass.
The implementation and employment
of new technology through state and
federal incentives encourages a health-
ier environment and provides a finan-
cially feasible way to sustain efficiency
by reducing the costs of operation and
conserving resources. Such informa-
tion for your own city is available
through the Database of State Incen-
tives for Renewables & Efficiency, an
online database funded by the U.S.
Department of Energy's Office of Ener-
gy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.
On a smaller scale, I've noticed a
number of changes within my two
short months of residence in Illinois.
Public restrooms remove paper towel
dispensers and replace them with
strong air current dryers. Inner-city
farmers markets extend their hours
of operation to weekdays, specifically
lunch hours, providing an alternative
for the working world's lunch break
and grocery run. Recycling containers
are found on every corner and clothing
dispensaries for the needy are numer-
ous. Water bottle fillers providing a
"number of bottles saved" to users are
engineered into many of the public
water fountains, becoming a city norm.
A number of restaurants provide cloth
napkins, regardless of their level of for-
mality. Chicago provides easy ways for
people to minimize waste and reuse or
reallocate resources. Small incentives
and practices add up, and the collective
result could be major.
We're the generation thtat will turn
the tables. We'll change and revital-
ize the American culture by using
innovative ways to introduce and
implement sustainable and efficient
business regimes into our communi-
ties. Through education, network-
ing and imagination, it's possible to
take advantage of this "green" sec-
tor of the business economy, tweak
it to your needs and maximize its
results for both your benefit and that
of the environment. To an extent, our
health, safety and happiness derive
from our atmosphere. If we focus on
sustainability and intentionally chat-
lenge ourselves to reuse materials in
innovative ways, we will revive our
communities and provide for multi-
dimensional, positive remunerations.
Look at your lifestyle, identify the
source of waste, start small-scale and
take an active role within your com-
munity to further new practices and
become a catalyst for reform.

Designer Sagmeister
talks happiness, diaries

The IASA core has been planning Friday's show since last March.
IASA prepares for
'ZASTANA'"

By JULIA KLINE
For the Daily
Stefan Sagmeister's work is
simultaneously playful and pro-
found. Towering inflatable mon-
keys proclaim "Everyone Always
Thinks They Are Right." A wall
of green and overripe bananas
shouts the mantra "Self Confi-
dence Produces Fine Results."
A digital interactive spiderweb
responds to the slightest move-
ments of the observer.
Sagmeister, an idiosyncrat-
ic graphic designer who gave
Thursday's Penny W. Stamps
School of Art & Design Speaker
Series, has created these and doz-
ens more strikingly original piec-
es in. a career that has spanned
four decades.
The Austrian-born design
luminary began his career at a
youth magazine at the age of 15.
After honing his craft in Hong
Kong and New York, Sagmeis-
ter founded the New York-based
design firm Sagmeister Inc. in
1993.
He first gained widespread
attention in 1999 when he adver-
tised alecture by having an intern
slice the relevant details into
Sagmeister's torso. The result-
ing photo advertisements were
shocking and representative of
Sagmeister's design style, which
is convention-shattering and
unflinchingly brave. Other mod-
ern icons have gravitated toward
this inspired iconoclast. David
Byrne of the Talking Heads and
Rolling Stones are only a few of
Sagmeister's long-standing col-
laborators.
In this lecture, called "Design
and Happiness," he explored the
factors that contribute to happi-
ness and posed the question: Can
I pursue happiness in design?

28th annual show
to focus on current
generation
By ALICIA ADAMCZYK
DailyArts Writer
Nine students huddle around
tables in the Ross School of Busi-
ness, using the half-hour break
to inhale a light
dinner and take ZASTANA:
a moment to
relax. Papers, Th
computers and of Our
a three-foot
wide banner Generation
are scattered Friday at 7 p.m.
across the Hill Aoditoriom
ground and
tabletops, From $12
where the stu-
dents - all core members of the
Indian American Student Asso-
ciation's cultural dance show -
talk excitedly about the music
and performances that will soon
fill Hill Auditorium.
In its 28th year, the IASA Cul-
tural Show is one of the most
popular and highly regarded
cultural events at the University.
Over 220 IASA members will
dance across the stage Friday,
highlighting choreography from
traditional Indian dances to con-
temporary hip hop.
While the annual show has
become somewhat of a staple
of the University community,
few may realize the strenuous
lengths to which IASA must go
to put on the production each
year.
LSA senior Rohit Maramraju
said the group began prepa-
rations for the 2012 show in
March, when he and fellow
LSA senior Proma Khosla were
selected as show coordinators by
the IASA council. Fast forward
to Friday, Maramraju, Khosla,
who is a Daily Arts writer, and
hundreds of other IASA show
members will showcase eight
months of planning and practic-
ing. But as the co-coordinators

and their seven-member core
leadership team described, the
path to Friday's performance
was no easy feat.
After selecting seven IASA
members to act as liaisons among
the choreographers, dancers
and organizers, Maramraju and
Khosla sat down with the "Fan-
tastic Core" to discuss a theme
for the year's performance. After
arguing well into the night, the
leadership team decided on
"ZASTANA: The Pulse of Our
Generation."
"That just refers to how we, as
a generation, have a mix of cul-
tures," Maramraju explained.
"Some of us may have been born
in India, some of us may have
been born here, but we're still
mixed in some way."
Maramraju said the 22 cho-
reographems, who, applied for
positions in March, contributed
to the theme by fusing western-
ized dances, like jazz and hip
hop, with various types of Indi-
an dances, including Bollywood
and Bhangra.
"When you consider each of
the dances we're doing ... each of
these have their own identifying
characteristics," Neil Bhatt, an
engineering senior and mem-
ber of the seven-person core,
explained. "Fusion elements
refers to Western elements,
Western beats ... that kind of
give the dances different tex-
ture."
- Choreographers then had
five months to create a dance
and select music to fit their
theme. Once classes started in
September, 222 IASA members,
through a lottery process, were
selected to perform in one of the
show's nine dances. Since then,
as Maramraju said, it has been
"practice, practice, practice."
At this point, Maramraju,
Bhatt and the other leaders kept
an eye on dancers and choreog-
raphers, while conceptualizing a
logo for the event. This year, the
show's logo is based off a pea-
cock, the national bird of India.
"The peacock feather is very

intricate," Maramraju said.
"One of the main reasons we
chose it is the cultural aspect ...
we still want to stay humble to
our roots."
Business sophomore Suhind
Kodali said the most difficult
part of planning the show was
making sure to communicate
with the hundreds of members
involved while simultaneously
keeping up with classes and tak-
ing care of the logistical issues of
the show.
"One of the hardest parts I
think as a show core member is
the scale that this show is on,"
Kodali said. "How do you sell
tickets to 4,000 people? How do
you organize 300 dancers?"
In the final weeks leading
to the show, the core said that
virtually all of its time has been
spent focusing on perfecting the
different show elements.
"Sure, we have school,"
Maramraju said. "But for every
minute we get away from school
we truly try to show everyone
the hard effort we've put into it."
Engineering junior Tanay
Kulkarni said the workload for
the planning process increased
incrementally over the eight-
month planning period from an
hour a week at first to several
hours a day in the final week.
"I wouldn't expect it to be
anything less than a full-time
job," Kulkani said.
LSA junior and core member
Mallika Sarma didn't attend
classes this past week in order
to prepare for the show. She
said though friends of hers who
aren't in IASA don't completely
understand her commitment to
the performance, she believes
the sacrifices she made were
well worth it.
"It's very difficult to explain
to other people, when you're like
'Hey, I'm not going to be talking
to regular people for about three
weeks,' " she said with a know-
ing smile. "But at the same time
.. it's definitely worth it. Over-
all, it's one of the best things I've
done in college."

Haggis to bring eclectic
sound to the Ark

"No, old Bond. I expect you to die."
Resurrecting Bond

Fifty-year franchise
will hopefully grow
under Mendes
ByADITI MISHRA
DailyArts Writer
Britain's most characteristic
film series churns out its 23rd
installment this weekend with
"Skyfall." There's no action hero
more iconic than James Bond,
and anyone who doubts that was
probablybornyesterday.
And yet in the small span of my
own life, the Bond series has pro-
duced films that border on van-
ity, superficiality and extreme
irrelevance, repeating the same
exhausted formula again and
again. We get it - Bond can do no
wrong. MGM might as well have
shipped the series off to Marvel's
offices and converted Bond into
an indestructible superhero with
a perverse indifference toward
women.
Then in 2006, out of the blue,
MGM did something that gar-
nered more backlash than any
other film casting in history: hir-
ing Daniel Craig ("The Girl with
the Dragon Tattoo"). The outrage
that followed the replacement of
Pierce Brosnan was hysterical
and almost ridiculous.
The resulting "Casino Royale"
couldn't have rendered the deci-
sion more irrelevant even if it
tried, which it unquestionably
did. Little did we know then,

ignorant as we are, that Craig
and director Martin Campbell's
genius in "Royale" would change
the way we viewed Bond forever.
"Royale" mustered the guts to
go where no Bond film had ever
gone before - it strove to make
its protagonist more human. Yes,
I said it. Bond is no superhero,
people. And he was never meant
to be. Craig's transformation of a,
previously insensitive character
into a genuinely heartbroken,
sensitive, flawed and foolhardy
spy resurrected a fading fran-
chise.
The series hasn't fully revived
itself just yet. "Royale" sig-
naled changing times for the
series and this change was met
with positive response. 2008's
"Quantum of Solace" continued
on this track, but lost somg foot-
ing as director Marc Foster mis-
takenly confused the Bond set
for the Bourne one. And now we
have "Skyfall."
Directed by Sam Mendes,
"Skyfall" promises so much
potential for becoming a cor-
nerstone in this iconic series
and steering it, finally and posi-
tively, away from the worn-out
antics that rendered almost every
Bond movie made in the last two
decades utterly forgettable.
Mendes himself is an unusual
choice for a Bond direbtor, having
mostly directed character-driv-
en, soapy dramas on relatively
tiny budgets. But this might be
exactly what makes him a great
choice. Mendes is no stranger to

making iconic movies - "Ameri-
can Beauty" was made with only
three things: a captivating vision
and two flawless lead actors.
More than anything, Mendes's
hiring indicates that the execs
behind Bond are still on the path
to change - they're experiment-
ing, and they're movingthe series
forward into a place that's not
only relevant to the people of this
century but also competitive in a
rapidly evolving film industry.
If the initial reviews of "Sky-
fall" are anything to go by, it's
probably safe to assume that
Mendes has managed to make
people once again sit up and
take notice of Bond. The Bieber
generation needs to know
that James Bond is not Jason
Bourne's sidekick. And we're in'
desperate need of reassurance
that this series deserves to be
made over 23 times in an unbe-
lievable and unprecedented span
of 50 years.
Regardless of how far Mendes
manages to push this series' lim-
its,there's no doubt that Craig and
a string of intelligent and vision-
ary directors have managed to
make Bond believable again. The
essence of Bond - guns, gorgeous
girls and evil villains - will never
lose its mass appeal; but without
Craig's intervention, this series
would have died six years ago.
Which is why somewhere out
there, right now, the man whose
casting generated such a furor
is having the last laugh. And the
joke's on us.

degree of tra-

into its performances, the spe-

may sound familiar to fans of
Mumford and Sons and other
mainstream folk artists. Celtic
fusion includes a large assort-
ment of instruments and songs
ranging from upbeat rock with
sing-a-long choruses to slower
alternative pop ballads. But to
write them off as just another
folk band would bea mistake.
The unusual name is what
first strikes most about the band.
While it evokes images of Celtic
tradition, Craig Downie, who
plays a variety of instruments
including bagpipes and harmon-
ica for the band, says there's more
to the moniker than just a catchy
name.
"Well, originally we were just
trying to think up something
interesting," Downie said. "We
kept the name because haggis
is sort of a survival food, it's put
together out of the less desirable
parts of a sheep."
Downie relates the band's
music to the traditional Scottish
dish.
"Our music is a lot like that
because it's quite diversified.
We're definitely survivors and we
do have an unusual assortment of
instruments and styles that were
thrown together."

variety of instruments and are

The competition ends on Nov. 16,
and is open to any student with
an idea that can be conveyed in a
30-second video.
Last year's winners of the com-
petition included UM Speaks, a
platformshowcasinginformation
on upcoming campus speakers,
and Turtle Cell, a smart phone
case that holds headphones to
prevent them from tangling.
CSG's campaign asks students
to submit ideas to the 1,000 Pitch-
es campaign in whatever category
they choose, and the top four or
five pitches will then be imple-
mented to become reality. Parikh
said within three hours of send-
ing out the e-mail on Thursday,
he received at least 150 responses
ranging from tweets to page-long
documents.
The winners CSG selects will
be given access to necessary cam-
pus resources and administrative
officials through CSG in order
to successfully implement their
projects.

State game on Oct. 20 and will
continue for the upcoming home
game tomorrow against North-
western and Iowa on Nov. 17.
Hamet added that though the
group currently has 19 ambas-
sadors, reaching out to LSA-SG
and the SAAC will help MAP
foster-the support it needs, since
more volunteers will be available
to help students make safer deci-
sions.
"Now that we've branched
out, we need to branch out even
further ... we really want to get
30 to 40 ambassadors (but) we
don't want to go too big because
we want to keep everything
organized and under control," he
said.
LSA senior Caroline Canning,
the president of LSA-SG, wrote
in an e-mail interview that all
students are encouraged to par-
ticipate in the program, not just
members of Greek Life, since the
program affects the entire stu-
dent body.
"All LSA students (and non-
LSA students) can volunteer to
be ambassadors in the program,
and we are working in our stu-
dent life and health committees
to increase visibility and aid the
program," Canning wrote.
On game days, the ambassa-
dors' stationed on the corner of
South State Street and Hill Street
offer suggestions on how toavoid
violations of city ordinances and
advise against risky decisions,
such as carrying an open con-
tainer or acting recklessly. There
are also volunteers stationed
at the Michigan Union to serve
as organizers, and if a situation
becomes an emergency, ambassa-
dors are encouraged to call Ann
Arbor Police, the University's
Department of Public Safety or

911, depending on the situation.
In order to become an ambas-
sador, students attend an hour-
long training session with the
DPS, the University Health Ser-
vice and the AAPD. After train-
ing, students may sign up for one
to two hour shifts during game
days or other specified events,
according to Laura Raines, an
LSA senior and vice president of
public relations for the Univer-
sity's Pan-Hellenic Association.
Raines said the program hopes
to increase its visibility on cam-
pus by offering students help
without handing out citations.
"It's definitely about being vis-
ible right now and helping people
become aware of the safety con-
cerns ... we are not trying to be
law enforcement, but if we see
something (dangerous) that is
happening we will approach the
situation," she said.
While volunteering before a
game may seem like a sacrifice,

Parikh said this will be made
possible by giving students access
to CSG's Entrepreneurship Com-
mission which will help them"
institutionalize their ideas by
connecting them with the appro-
priate University administrators,
and promoting the final solutions
to the studentbody."
Last year 1,000 Pitches
received 3,303 pitches, according
to LSA and Business School junior
Scott Christopher, president of
MPowered Entrepreneurship.
This year, the group has already
received more than 3,700 submis-
sions, making it the world's larg-
est student-run elevator pitch - a
proposal for an idea that can be
given quickly- competition.
"This year we hope to reach
5,000 pitches while also having
greater involvement with our
1,000 Pitches Summit," Christo-
pher said.
Eventually, Christopher said
MPowered would like to extend
the competition beyond the Uni-
versity.
"We would love to see 1,000
Pitches spread outside of Ann
Arbor to other U of M campuses
and to universities across the
state and country," Christo-
pher said. "We are also tossing
around the idea to expand to high
schools."
she said incentives are available
for those who give their time to
be an ambassador.
Volunteers are eligible to
receive tickets to Michigan bas-
ketball and hockey games, gift
cards to local restaurants, appar-
el and points towards the H.A.L
program - which offers prizes to
students that arrive early to foot-
ball games or attend non-revenue
sporting events. Ambassadors
can also receive letters of recom-
mendations for their work.
Hamet said since its imple-
mentation last year, the program
has received a generous amount
of support from the University,
and the Athletic Department
has donated prize incentives
and other student groups have
worked to round up volunteers.
"I'm really proud of what it has
become, especially to get the sup-
port from the University itself ...
it is awesome to see the entire
University, not just students,
come together for this program."
He added that the program
is important for maintaining a
positive image of the University
among other rival schools.
"We represent the Big Ten,"
Hamet said. "We have other Big
Ten opponents coming to town ...
and we don't want to give them
the wrong impression of what
Michigan is all about. We are not
the only Big Ten School to do this
(program), so we don't want to
fall behind."
Engineering senior Jake
Wood, the vice president of
finance for IFC, said he volun-
teered as an ambassador dur-
ing several events, including the
most recent game against MSU.
"I find that it is a sense of
responsibility," Wood said. "We,
as students, are the ones that are
going about with these recre-
ational activities. I feel that we,
as students, should be the ones
that make sure that our peers are

being safe while still being able to
enjoy themselves."
During his shift, Wood said
he dealt with a few disrespect-
ful students, but the majority of
people were willing to listen to
advice from peers rather than
face discipline from authorities.
"We're out there to help so no
one gets tickets or has to deal with
any law enforcement, as much
as we can help it," Wood said.
"When we tell people, 'We're just
trying to help you from getting a
ticket,' I think people realize lis-
tening to what we suggested is
better than having to deal with
law enforcement."
LSA sophomore Lexi Wyckoff
said she thinks it is important
for the University to take a lead-
ership role in promoting safe
drinking and tailgate practices.
"I think it has become more of
a problem across campuses, and
I think it is cool that Michigan is
taking an initiative."

SAPAC
From Page 1A
Rackham student Ali Chet-
wynd, a volunteer at Speak Out,
said the event was geared toward
cultivating an atmosphere of
safety and warmth.
"A lot of the symbolism of this
event ... is designated to give a
visual correspondence to the
sense of cumulative support and
solidarity described," Chetwynd
said. "Speak Out is very overt
about the idea that each individ-
ual who speaks out becomes part
of a whole by doing so."
The event also aimed to raise

awareness about SAPAC, which
supports survivors of sexual vio-
lence. Speakers emphasized the
severity of sexual violence statis-
tics on college campuses, citing
the fact that one in four college
women and one in nine college
men have been sexually assault-
ed.
They added itis vital that Uni-
versity students are educated in
how to take action when dealing
with an individual affected by
sexual violence.
"My personal goal is that
if anyone has a survivor that
comes to them ... they can take
them to SAPAC and to appropri-
ate resources," Howe said. "So

my goal is for everyone to know
enough about SAPAC so that if
they care for a survivor, they can
help them."
Public Health graduate stu-
dent Carley Flanery, who has
been a member of SAPAC for five
years, said she hopes awareness
about sexualviolence will soonbe
a higher priority for the Univer-
sity's administration, and SAPAC
is working toward advancing this
progress.
"Because of the nature of the
subject, it is not the highest pri-
ority for the University to talk
about, but I feel like we are mak-
ing strides in it at the same time,"
Flanery said. "(SAPAC is) doing

programs that are the best in the
nation in terms of how education
goes."
SAPAC provides numerous.
resources for survivors of sexual
violence, individuals seekinghelp
for others who have.been sexually
assaulted and students who want
information about protecting
themselves against sexual vio-
lence. One of the organization's
most popular resources is its
peer-led support group in which
survivors share and express con-
cerns among peers.
SAPAC also has a 24-hour
crisis line and an office line for
survivors and those assisting
survivors.

Though Michigan notched 15
goals and 26 assists in the season
series, it couldn't escape the pres-
sure of the Michigan State power
play. On multiple occasions, the
Wolverines took a lead into the
third period before penalties
struck in untimely ways.
In their first meeting last year,
Michigan took its comfortable 4-1
lead into the final frame, which
was just barely enough to seal a
4-3 win after the Spartans' power
play registered back-to-back goals.
But the Wolverines couldn't
stave off Michigan State the next
night. Knotted at two entering
the last period, Michigan net-
ted a late goal before then-junior
forward Kevin Lynch was sent to
the box for holding. The Spartans
answered with the game-tying
goal before a scoreless overtime
period and shootout victory.
Feb. 10 also seemed familiar, as
the then-No. 4 Michigan carried
a narrow 2-1 lead into the third
period. Boarding and tripping
penalties allowed the Spartans a
pair of goals in the opening five
minutes of the stanza en route to
Michigan's 3-2 loss.
"I remember those," said Mich-
igan coach Red Berenson. "There
were some poor penalties called,
thereweresomepoorgoalsscored,
there was some breaks that went
against us and then there were
some lapses on our part."
The way last season's games
unfolded, headlined by special
teams, might just repeat itself this
weekend as the 11th-ranked Wol-
verines play Michigan State at
home tonight and at East Lansing
on Saturday.
Berenson used this week's
practice to improve the Michigan
power play, which will be key in
taking advantage of Michigan
State's CCHA-high 125 minutes of
penalties.
"I think it will be a weekend of
mistakes," Berenson said. "What-
ever teamcan force the other team
to make the most mistakes could
be costly."
Though they often find them-
selves short-handed, the Spartans
have been consistent in killing
penalties (85.7 percent) and bril-

liant on the power play (25.7 per-
cent). Michigan State went 4-for-7
in its last game against Bowling
Green to split the series and even
its record at .500. Berenson com-
pared the two teams on the "ups
and downs" since both have yet
to collect a series win this season.
The Wolverines have lost depth
on defense and special teams as
of late. They entered conference
play with a perfect record on the
penalty kill, but they have since
dropped, surrenderingthree man-
advantage goals last weekend at
the hands of Northern Michigan.
Michigan remains atop the
CCHA, scoring 4.43 goals per
game, but its defense ranks at the
bottom, allowing an average of
3.43 goals.
"I think you can have the best
of both worlds," Berenson said.
"I think you can be number one
offensively and you can also be
number one defensively. ... The
name of the game is to score
goals, but right now we're a .500
team and the reason we're a .500
team is because of too many goals
against"

PAUL OHERMAN/Daily
Freshman goaltender Jared Rutledge will make the start in net on Friday.

The blue line hasn't been able
stifle its opponents due to a slew
of injuries, leaving Berenson to
rotate through the roster just to fill
the lineup. Along with the bruised
defensive corps is the unsettled
goalie situation between fresh-
men netminders Jared Rutledge
and Steve Racine.
Racine let eight combined goals
sneak between the posts against
the Wildcats last weekend, which
might be why Berenson named
Rutledge the starter in the series
opener.
Fortunately for the Wolverines,
the offense - ledby senior captain
A.J. Treais - has compensated for
the lack of defensive depth. The
preseason all-CCHA honorable
mention has notched six goals and
an assist in his 15 career games
againstthe Spartans.
"Normally, there's a little more
urgency and a'sense of impor-
tance," Berenson said. "There's
a little more buzz around the
games, before the games, the fans,
especially when you're playing at
home. ... We belong in this game.

Michigan should triumph back at home
By LUKE PASCI4
Daily Sports Editor
Well, a lot has changed since
the last time Michigan played at
the Big House.
The Wolverines (4-1 Big Ten,
6-3 overall) return home follow-
ing an eventful two-game stint
on the road - a
23-9 loss against N'Westem
Nebraska and
a 35-13 victory at Michigan

chances to get to

Saturday, a talented North-
western team (3-2, 7-2) comes
into town. Michigan no longer
controls its own destiny to get to
the championship, but the only
thing it can do to keep the chance ERIN KiRKLAND/Daily
alive is keep winning. Sophomore wide receiver/quarterback Devin Gardner filled in admirably for senior Denard Robinson last Saturday in Minneapolis. Michigan beat Minnesota, 35-13.


Michigan pass offense vs.
Northwestern pass defense
Northwestern has surrendered
272 passing yards per game this
season, which is the worst total
in the conference. Still, Michigan
offensive coordinator Al Borges
tends to stick to his guns, and the
Wolverine offense will still have a
run-first mentality.
But .Robinson and Gardner
have the ability to find a groove
in the passing game. Last week,
after a rough first quarter that
;included an interception, Gard-
ner settled down and took con-
trol of the tempo. He finished the
game 12-of-18 passing with a pair
of touchdowns.
Northwestern's pass rush isn't
special, and the coverage tends to
be shoddy at times, so both Rob-
inson and Gardner should be able
to hit their targets.
Edge: Michigan
Michigan rush offense vs.
Northwestern rush defense
Michigan's running backs have
underperformed this season, and
it's no secret. But if Robinson
plays Saturday, the Wolverine
rushing attack is still among the
most dynamic in the country.

Michigan coach Brady Hoke has
stayed mum this week regarding
the health of Robinson's throw-
ing elbow, and his status is totally
up in the air.
If Robinson is not available,
junior quarterback Devin Gard-
ner will start in his place, as he
did at Minnesota last weekend.
Gardner doesn't run the read
option as much as Robinson, and
he'll find himself under center
more often, with fewer designed
runs.
That puts a greater burden on
junior running back Fitzgerald
Toussaint and sophomore run-
ning back Thomas Rawls, as well
as the offensive line, to produce in
the ground game.
Northwestern's linebacking
corps is solid. Northwestern has
the worst pass defense in the Big
Ten and teams have been throw-
ing at will against them. The
Wildcat front seven has been very
adept at stopping the run so far
this season.
Edge: Push
Northwestern pass offense vs.
Michigan pass defense
Though Northwestern prefers
finding space on the ground, the
Michigan secondary needs to be

wary of the big play over the top.
When the opportunity presents
itself, Colter isn't afraid to launch
the ball deep should a receiver
find room behind the safeties.
Against Iowa, one of his six com-
pletions was a 47-yard touchdown
strike to Christian Jones.
Still, the Wildcat receiv-
ing corps is relatively weak,
and Michigan's defensive backs
should be able to reel them in eas-
ily. The Wolverines have given
up the fewest passing yards per
game (145) and the fewest touch-
downs (six) in the Big Ten.
Edge: Michigan
Northwestern rush offense vs.
Michigan rush defense
Northwestern's offense
employs a run-heavy spread,
but its operation is dependent
on whoever the hot hand is at
quarterback. The Wildcats have
tried out both junior Kain Colter
and sophomore Trevor Siemian.
Colter has started lately, which
makes sense because the offense
is a bit more dynamic with his
dual-threat capabilities.
In Northwestern's last game,
against Iowa, Colter kept the
ball on the ground 26 times and
picked up 171 yards, and he only

threw the ball nine times. And
the fact that he could also hand
the ball to junior running back
Venric Mark, who has compiled
over 1,000 yards this season,
makes matters tricker.
Michigan's front seven will be
busy on Saturday, and Hoke will
likely clog the box as much as
possible.
The Wolverine rush defense
has been average through the
course of the season, but it has
improved in recent weeks against
Michigan State, Nebraska and
Minnesota.
Expect the Wildcats keep it on
the ground throughout the game.
Edge: Northwestern
Special teams
Michigan redshirt junior kick-
er Brendan Gibbons was named
a semifinalist for the 2012 Lou
Groza Collegiate Placekicker
Award, given annually to the best
kicker in the country, on Nov. 5.
He is 15 for 17 on the year, and
he knocked through a career-long
52-yarder at Nebraska two weeks
ago.
But Northwestern placekicker
Jeff Budzien, has been equally
impressive, good on 11 of his 12
attempts this season.

Overall, the Wolverines' spe-
cial-teams play has been messy
recently, as punter Will Hagerup
has been shanking punts and the
coverage unit has been porous.
Michigan will have its hands full
with Mark, who has a pair of punt
returns for touchdowns this sea-
son.
Edge: Northwestern
Intangibles
There's nothing quite like
home.
Michigan returns to the Big
House for the first time in 21 days,
and fans will be excited to see the
Wolverines back in action. Ryan
Field, in Evanston, holds about
50,000 fans. This weekend, over
twice as many people will sit in
Michigan Stadium, screaming at
the Wildcats.
Pat Fitzgerald is a great coach,
and he will do everything in his
power to get his players ready.
But they might not be ready for an
atmosphere like this.
Edge: Michigan
Final score (with Robinson):
Michigan 35, Northwestern 10
Final score (without Robinson):
Michigan 24, Northwestern 13

"It's disappointing, but I'm not
going to hold any bad feelings or
anything, because this is still my
University. I still love Michigan
athletics, football is still my fam-
ily. It's one of them things that is
going to make me I guess tougher,
because it does - you get kind of
numb toward the rejection."
But inthe days after he found out
that he didn't get the job, Floyd took
to Twitter and voiced his frustra-
tions. His series of tweets read like
this:
"Moved back from Ann Arbor
three months ago because I was
promised a job in the Athletic
Department...I am a former stu-
dent-athlete and national champi-
on. After a promise and 3 months of
waiting and interviewing and wait-
ing more, they go and hire some-
one else...Leaders and Best? SMH.
Still, my loyalty is with Michigan.
I'll always support one of my favor-
ite people, Coach Hoke, any way
I can. There is serious disconnect
between the athletic department
and the athletic alumni and they
wonder why we don't come or give
back!"
Still, despite the setback, Floyd
remained resolute and confident
that he will find the job and career
he desires. He insists that he's at the
point where he won't be settling for
anything.
"It's just one of those things
where somebody's going to have to
give you a chance, and if they take
a chance on me, I won't disappoint
them," Floyd said. "I've never had a
job or left a job where, regardless of
what it was, they felt like I didn't do
a good job."
When cases like these emerge,
it's only natural to search for some-
one to point the finger at. But it
seems too complex an issue for any
one entity to shoulder-the blame,
Should the Athletic Department
or football program have done
more to help the men when they
were still playing? Floyd and Ray
stop short of saying that.
Floyd says that he had to fight
past some negative feelings about
his football mentors while strug-
gling in his post-football days.
"When my career ended, I
couldn't put together a resume,"
Floyd said. "I didn't have anything
to put on a resume but football.
When I was applying for these jobs
thinking Michigan should look
out (for me), that was me think-
ing selfishly, butat the same time,
I was very disappointed in myself
because I didn't prepare myself for
what I was going through."
Floyd also admits he wasn't the

most diligent student, doing just
enough to stay eligible but failing to
push himself academically and for
internship opportunities.
It's the same story for Ray, who
says he "ostracized himself from.
education." He doesn't blame any of
his coaches or support staff because
he says it wasn't their duty to make
sure he was preparing hinself for a
career. That doesn't mean the staff
was ignorant - former Michigan
coach Lloyd Carr told his star safe-
ty directly that he was an academic
underachiever.
Sword. also says "the only per-
son he blames is himself," since he
didn't take advantage of the oppor-
tunities that the University provid-
ed him. But he goes farther than his
former teammates.
"I'm not pointing the finger,"
Sword says. "I'm not trying to play
the blame game, because the Uni-
versity of Michigan gave me oppor-
tunities, took me places I would've
never imagined going ... but come
on man, you're talking about
18-19-year-old kids.
"I don't mean to be contradicting
myself, but there's got to be some-
thing that could've been done to
open our eyes about X-Y-Z."
If there's one thing the three
men agree on, it's that part of the
problem was their mentality. It's
one likelyshared by those following
in their footsteps across the coun-
try today.
To earn a scholarship to a Divi-
sion-I program, with rare excep-
tions, a. player has to be not only
talented but intensely dedicated
to the sport of football. And if one
has that combination, it's inevitable
that the game consumes most of
their lives.
When they finally do get to col-
lege, the necessary time and com-
mitment required only intensifies.
College football has developed into
a high-stakes, high-money sport,
with intense pressure on coaches
and players alike to be successful.
That means the latter group must
dedicate almost their entire lives to
the sport.
And when you are that good and
have spent that much time, why
would you think about doing any-
thing else after you leave school?
All three men say that all they real-
ly thought about doing was moving
on to the next level and playing for
a long time in the NFL. They con-
sidered nothing else - they were
football players. It was already
their job.
The sport has only gotten big-
ger in recent years thanks to the
influence of TV and other financial
interests. When asked at Michigan
media day about whether it wad
hard to imagine his future beyond

the daily grind of his sport, fifth-
year senior offensive guard Patrick
Omameh, a communications and
sociology double major, said that
it's "very, very difficult to think past
football," and agreed that it felt like
a full-time job.
The lack-of-time argument is
one that Shari Acho refuses to con-
sider.
Acho worked as an academic
counselor for the Michigan State
football team and then the Michi-
gan football team for 10 years, and
in her time at both universities, she
saw cases like Floyd -"lost souls,"
as she termed them. Acho said that
hearing those stories "drives me
every day (to) be passionate about
what I do (in) helpingthese kids."
That passion has manifested
itself ina relatively new program in
the Michigan athletic department
called the Michigan Career and
Professional Transition Program,
or M-PACT. Essentially the brain-
child of Acho that formed after she
noticed these issues developing, the
program received extensive sup-
port from then-new Athletic Direc-
tor Dave Brandon and others in the
Athletic Department.
M-PACT is now in its third year.
It's designed to help athletes dis-
cover their passions outside of their
sport, so that they will have more

of a plan and direction when their
playing days are over.
It's open to athletes in all sports
- Michigan football coach Brady
Hoke has made it mandatory for
his team - and has been very well
received by those who have partici-
pated.
Should M-PACT continue to gain
strength, perhaps those "souls"
won't ever lose their way.
"Then, when the success of the
game has been assured, and the
college course is finished, the man
who has been dined and feted has
to commence his life in the world...
The new clerk, who knows nothing
of business principle,-finds himself
far below men who seemed to look
up to him but a short time before."
- Harper's Weekly, Nov. 12,1892
It's Sept. 26, and Chris Floyd is
still in Ann Arbor.
He's still working days for Ann
Arbor Parks and Rec, and he's also
now an assistant football coach
for Skyline High School. He still
returns to work at the Blue Lep
occasionally, but the grind of foot-
ball season has made those shifts
less frequent.
Floyd isn't sure of exactly what

he'll do next - again - but he's
confident something will emerge.
He turned down an offer to return
to his old job in D.C., with better
pay, even, because he doesn't want
to concede a perfect fit elsewhere.
The former Michigan fullback
also still isn't thrilled with the way
the hiring process for the Athletic
Department position happened.
He attributed his decision to send
the combustive tweets, which have
since been deleted, to his lack of
knowledge about social media,
but stood by the sentiment behind
them.
"I don't take none of it back,"
Floyd said. "It is what it is. I sup-
port the football program and
Coach Hoke until the day I don't
support them no more. It's noth-
ing directed at him or football, but
at the same time, I feel like people
within the Athletic Department did
me wrong."
Floyd may be unsure of his next
move, but he remains resolute.
"I feel like as long as I continue to
network and put myself out there,
volunteer, or whatever the case may
be, I feel like something will come
in place ... I'm taking it as it comes."
Now, once more, Chris Floyd
must search for a path that's more
permanent. As many have discov-
ered, football isn't.

But he, too, emerged from his brief
NFL career in 2002 unsure of him-
self, and was behind his peers who
had already worked professionally
for several years.
Sword, too, gave coaching a
try, but found it wasn't for him; by
then, he was 30 years old and even
further behind. A job working as a
recreation supervisor for the city
of Palm Coast in Florida wasn't the
answer either.
Both Ray and Sword eventu-
ally did find their paths. The for-
mer battled through his depression
thanks to counseling and has writ-
ten an inspirational book partially
based on his experiences, titled
"Rays of Light: Volume1, 'Let There
Be Light.' " Ray is now trying to get
into broadcasting after enjoying an
appearance on WTKA, a Detroit
sports radio station, before the
Michigan State game last year.
After the recreation supervisor
job, Sword realized that he has a
passion working with disadvan-
taged kids, and he has been teach-
ing for the last four or five years,
currently at a juvenile detention
center.
"But it was hard now, I'm not say-
ing it was easy, just trying to figure
out what I wanted," Sword said.
"People were telling me all that I
did (at Michigan), but I said, this
doesn't define who I am."
It's July 11, and Chris Floyd has
learned that he didn't get the job
- the job that he came back to Ann
Arbor for, that he thought was defi-
nitely his, based on how he viewed
certain conversations he had with
the interviewer. Instead, it went to
a more qualified candidate, a former
Michigan track athlete named Jeff
Porter.
The department thought he
would be too football-focused, he
says, and that his references weren't
strong enough. One of them, Floyd
is told, even hung up on the inter-
viewer. (According to Floyd, when
he followed up with the reference, it
turned out there was miscommuni-
cation, and the reference apparently
tried to call the interviewer back
several times to no avail)
"It doesn't make sense," Floyd
said. "I'm disappointed. I'm really
disappointed, because it seems like
when I left D.C. to come here, I was
a shoo-in for the position."
The rejection is nothing new.
"I've been in this boat before,"
Floyd said. "I've been turned down
for several jobs here at the Univer-
sity. I've never made it this far. I've
never been interviewed for any job
at the University and I've applied
for a number ofjobs.

fter splitting snaps with
sophomore quarterback
Trevor Sieman early in the
season, Northwestern junior Kain
dolter has moved into a hybrid role
for the Wildcats, spending almost
equal time passing, rushing and
receiving.
Under center, Colter is 62-of-89
passing for 517 yards, with three
touchdowns and two interceptions
this fall. He has rushed 114 times for
622 yards and 11 touchdowns, and
caught 16 passes for 169 yards.
That's a busy stat line.
At Big Ten Media Days in July,
the Daily sat down with Colter to
discuss his jack-of-all-trades role in
the offense, following in the steps of
Dan Persa and his upcoming match-
up with the Michigan football team.
The Michigan Daily: You're the
returning leading rusher, receiver
and passer. Is quarterback truly
your preferred position?
Kain Colter: Definitely. You're the
leader out there on the field, every-
one's looking for you to have an
answer to any problems on the field.
I like being that guy. The other posi-
tions you don't get to have too much
control, and I like having control.
I'm not going to lie and say I don't
like going out there and running a
route or maybe playing some run-
ning back, it's all fun, but playing
quarterback is the best.

TMD: What does having that
leadership role mean to you?
KC: It means a lot. Look at the
guy we had last year - Dan Persa,
first team All-Big Ten quarterback
- I've got some bigshoes to fill. The
biggest thing is just trying to bring
the young guys along, giving them
an example of how we do things
and make sure they're able to play at
a high level once they get in.
TMD: Having to take over for
Persa, pretty daunting task, isn't it?
KC: Definitely. I learned a lot from
Dan, he was a guy who led by exam-
ple, the way he worked, the way
he led the team. I was able to get a
good picture of that before I stepped
into this role, so I try to mimic him
in some things I do, but at the same
time I'm goingto be a different play-
er. I'm not going to try to be exactly
like Dan Persa or exactly like Mike
Kafka, who was before him. They're
great quarterbacks but I'm going to
try to be myself. I feel like I offer the
team something a little different.
TMD: What can you bring to the
table that Persa and Kafka couldn't?
KC: Just being dynamic. The
defense never really knows where
I can be on the play and I can make
plays in a lot of different ways, I
think that's the biggest thing. At
quarterback I'm trying to improve
passing, be a pass-first quarterback,
and the defense has a lot of things

they're going to have to defend.
TMD: The Big Ten has steadily
moved toward a more spread-
offense, wildcat-type . scheme,
adapting with the times per se to
move away from its power-running
roots. Is that style of play good for
the conference?
KC: I think so. Dynamic quar-
terbacks, dual-threat quarterbacks
are exciting for the game. Look at

FLOYD
From Page 5
tions like this, Floyd feels he's the
perfect person to help reach out to
fellow alumni.
"I don't feel like there's anybody
(more) qualified," Floyd says.'
He became aware of the open
position during a visit to Ann Arbor
in March; by April, he decided to
leave the job he had in Washington,
D.C. working for the Department of
Defense, fully confident he would
land this one in the Athletic Depart-
ment.
Floyd went to Ann Arbor to go
through the interview process but
he had no income, so he picked up
the security work at the Blue Lep. In
the daytime, he also worked for the
Ann Arbor Parks and Recreations

department, doing field mainte-
nance for the city's parks.
By early June, Floyd's resolve
hadn't weakened.
"I think that the job is mine, it's
only amatter of time before I get the
call to start," Floyd said then. "But
until that happens, I have to keep
grinding it out every day for the city
of Ann Arbor, and that's what I'm
doing."
He hadn't considered the possi-
bility that he wouldn't be hired.
"I'm telling you, I don't even
think that way. I'm so positive that
this is goingto work out. I just don't
see it not workingout."
Not every former Division-I foot-
ball player struggles to find his way
once his playing days conclude. But

Floyd isn't alone, either.
Marcus Ray, a safety at Michigan
from 1994-98, is forever immor-
talized in Wolverine lore for his
vicious hit on Ohio State wide
receiver David Boston in the 1997
edition of the rivalry game, which
was captured by Sports Illustrated
and used as the magazine's cover
the week after the game.
Many Michigan fans no doubt
saved that cover, a reminder of the
glorious year that was 1997.
Those fans never saw the "life
depression" that Ray fell in to when
his short-lived NFL career came to
an end after a groin injury in 2001.
They didn't see how Ray struggled
through a doomed marriage, how
the former defensive back ballooned
by more than 100 pounds and how
he went through the motions as
a high school coach and graduate

assistant at Michigan and Central
Michigan for the next 10 years.
He compared his high-school
coaching experience to that of a
drug addict - the few hours he got
of it a day were a high, but the rest of
his life was the painful come-down.
"I think my outside appearance
was a reflection of what was going
on with Marcus Ray on the inside,"
he says. "I didn't like myself any-
more. I didn't know how to like
myself without athletics or without
being in shape.
"I didn't have anything to hang
my hat on, so I spent a lot of time
in my own mind, living in 1997,
because that's where I felt comfort-
able. That was the last real taste of
success that I experienced."
Sam Sword, a classmate of Ray's,
is the third all-time leading tackler
in Michigan history, with 265 stops.

Denard Robinson, Taylor Martinez,
MarQueis Gray, Braxton Miller and
myself - some pretty good athletes
right there who have huge play-
making ability. When we're on the
field there's going to be some high-
lights and it gets the fans excited.
TMD: What can you take from
Denard Robinson's game, his style
of play and improvement the last
few years that you can use for your-
self?
KC: I was able to talk to him yes-
terday for the first time and the first
thing you notice is that he's a real
humble man. He made a lot of plays
in his career - I remember being in
high school and looking up to him,
wanting to do some things that
he did. He does some really good
things out there on the field, run-
ning the ball and throwing the ball,
leading his team. I think he's a really
unselfish player, that's probably the
biggest thing I've taken from him.
Everybody's unique, everyone has
their own skills and abilities, so
I'm just going to be myself and also
take some tips fromguys around the
league.
TMD: We saw you working in the
backfield successfully with the read
option againstMichigan last season.
KC: The biggest thing last year
was that we weren't consistent
enough. We had good quarters and
some really bad quarters. So I think

as we approach this year we've got
to try to be a little more consistent.
We had a really good game plan
coming into the Michigan game last
year, some guys executed in the first
half but we had some bad plays in
the second half and things didn't go
our way. We definitely had a chance
to win that game.
TMD: You've faced Michigan
in Evanston, almost looked like a
split crowd but nonetheless a home
game, what are you expecting for
your visit to the Big House?
KC: I'm excited. One of the rea-
sons I decided to come to North-
western was because of all the
stadiums I'd be able to play at.
Michigan's one of the best venues
in the nation. Excited to play there,
can't wait, definitely a game I'm
looking forward to.
TMD: It's been well document-
ed that Northwestern hasn't won
a bowl game since the 1949 Rose
Bowl. What would it mean to your
team to secure the program's sec-
ond bowl win?
KC: Everybody on the team right
now wants to be able to say that we
were the class, we were the team
that was able to change the stigma
that we've had about how we've
done in bowl games. We want to be
part of something special, some-
thing we've been working towards,
and hopefully we can get that done.

Colter applauds the steady influx of dual-threat quarterbacks into the Big Ten in recent years.

Floyd was drafted by the New Eng-
land Patriots in the third round of
the 1998 NFL draft, 81st overall, after
helping lead the Wolverines to their
1997 national championship as the
starting fullback.
Third rounders have a decent shot
at playing for a long time in the league.
While they aren't expected to be
stars, third rounders have more than
a puncher' s chance at carving out a
role for themselves, and many end up
as solid veterans.
This wasn't the case for Floyd. He
never made it past special teams in his
two-plus years with the Patriots, and
first-year coach Bill Belchick cut him
after a penalty-filled game in front of
Floyd's family and friends in Detroit
on Thanksgiving in 2000.
Floyd couldn't find a permanent
home in 2001, either. From there, he
spent the next two years as a football
vagabond, training and trying to make
teams. But workouts with Detroit,
Atlanta and Buffalo didn't amount to
anything. He also tried out with the
Chicago Rush of the Arena Football
League and spent some time with the
La Crosse Night Train of the National
Indoor Football League, buoyed by
former Michigan teammate Diallo
Johnson.
It was after Floyd's last NFL tryout
in 2003 that the trying times, the car-
ousel of short-term jobs lacking long-
term prospects, began.
"I think my lowest point was being
turned down for jobs," Floyd said. "I'm
talking about odd jobs. There's been so
many jobs I've applied for."
So many, in fact, that Floyd used
to keep a notebook of all the rejec-
tion letters he received. But it's spring
2012, and he thinks he's finally found
his calling. For Floyd, it's long been an
aspiration to come back to Michigan
and work in the Athletic Department.
The past five years have seen many
applications turned in, but nothing
substantial has come of them.
This time, though, Floyd feels like
he's made for the assistant director
for alumni engagement position that is
now open.
From talking to his former team-
mates, he says that some ex-Wolver-
ines feel "used" by the program since
they feel unwelcome to come back.
Floyd points to one incident to illus-
trate this sentiment. At the 2003 home
game against Ohio State, he, former
safety Eric Mays and former running
back Chris Howard were watching on
the sidelines despite not having tick-
ets. They were eventually escorted off
the field by police, while former quar-
terback Drew Henson and Yankees
star shortstop Derek 3oter - also tick-
etless but a constan get of ABC's
cameras - remaine the-ield for
the whole game.
Having experienced frustra-
See FLOYD, Page 6

"Can one wonder that under the
circumstances the relative impor-
tance of work and sport is sometimes
lost in the mind of a twenty-year-old
undergraduate?"- Harper's Weekly,
Nov.12,1892
The crowds of students
huddled impatiently
outside the Blue Lepre-
chaun bar last spring,
just as they do outside
any bar in any season here.
The first thing on their minds was
the bouncer - getting past him. If
they looked at him, it was only with a
fleeting glance, maybe one moment of
eye contact while their ID was in his
hands.
It wouldn't be enough time to rec-
ognize that this bouncer started on
Michigan's last national champion-
ship-winning team 15 years ago, the
only team to do so in the last 64 years.
"They have no idea (w461 am)," said
Chris Floyd;an NFL fullbacturned-
bouncer. "If anything, they will mis-

take me for a current player."
It's about a mile and a quarter from
Michigan Stadium to the Blue Lep, as
the bar is affectionately known. It's a
trek that takes about 20 minutes on
foot, a little faster by car.
For Floyd, it was a journey that last-
ed 15 years, one that took him through
at least six jobs, three internships and
a successful stint at grad school. All
of those occupations represented the
37-year-old's attempts to find a career
once his football days finally expired.
It's a journey that is still very much
ongoing - this latest job at the Blue
Lep is a mere placeholder. It keeps
income flowing while Floyd awaits the
opportunity that brought him back to
Ann Arbor, the place where he made
his name as a football star.
He is not the only one to go through
such travails. Countless other former
athletes, at Michigan and everywhere
else around the country, find them-
selves unsure of what to do when they
are told once and for all that they can
no longer play football - the only thing

they've known for most of their lives.
These aren't the true stars - the
Tom Bradys, the Charles Woodsons,
the LaMarr Woodleys - the men who
enjoy 10-to-15-year careers in the
NFL, and can live off their spoils the
rest of their lives.
These are the more forgotten play-
eris, men like Floyd. The ones who last
afewyears inthe NFL, perhaps,butno
longer.
Fifteen years after that national
championship, Chris Floyd is back in
the town he still loves. It's the town
where he once soaked in the cheers
of 100,000. fans every Saturday, back
when the future seemed limitless and
the present was free of worry. He's
holding a job so close to the Big House
- the place where he made so many
memories - that he's practically in its
shadow.
Yet that sadium never felt so far
away.y
