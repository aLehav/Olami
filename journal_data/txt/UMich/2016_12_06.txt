President-elect 
Donald 

Trump 
recently 
appointed 

Betsy DeVos, Michigan native 
and education activist, as the 
secretary of education, much 
to the disappointment many 
state stakeholders such as Steve 
Norton, executive director of 
Michigan Parents for Schools, 
an organization of Michigan 
parents working for public 
school funding.

“We were dismayed. But 

unfortunately 
not 
terribly 

surprised,” Norton said. “I 
believe 
(Trump) 
reached 

out to probably this most 
controversial, the most extreme 

option. I think it stunned a lot 
of people — I guess you could 
say we were stunned as well.”

DeVos and her husband, 

billionaire Dick DeVos, have 
been involved with numerous 
conservative 
efforts 
in 

Michigan, 
particularly 
the 

American 
Foundation 
for 

Children, which pushes for the 
expansion of charter schools 
and 
vouchers. 
DeVos 
has 

argued that this allows for less 
government 
regulation 
and 

permits parents to choose their 
children’s education, showing 
that public schools were not 
sufficiently meeting needs.

School vouchers are a system 

in which families are provided 
government subsidies to aid in 

Sean 
DeMonner, 
the 

information systems executive 
director 
of 
teaching 
and 

learning, highlighted the need 
for more faculty training and 
discussed the migration from 
CTools to Canvas with the the 
Senate Advisory Committee on 
University Affairs Monday.

The 
committee 
also 

addressed German Prof. Silke-
Maria 
Weineck 
and 
Sport 

Management 
Prof. 
Stefan 

Szymanski’s 
terms 
on 
the 

committee, which will end 
early due to Winter Break. No 
final decision could be made, 
as it is not under SACUA’s 
jurisdiction, according to LSA 
Representative 
and 
Biology 

Prof. John Lehman.

“It’s actually not SACUA’s 

decision to make,” Lehman 
said. 
“It’s 
the 
Senate 

Assembly’s decision to make, 
but in the case of somebody 
who is not going to complete 
their term, there is precedent 
for going down the hierarchy 
of votes. In terms of temporary 
replacement, we don’t really 
have precedent for that.”

The gender imbalance of 

SACUA was a key issue in the 
discussion of Weineck’s and 
Szymanski’s 
replacements. 

According to David Wright, 
associate 
professor 
of 

accounting, said the committee 
fears 
it 
is 
missing 
an 

opportunity to diversify the 

members 
because 
Weineck, 

one of the only two women on 
SACUA, is leaving.

“There is already a gender 

imbalance in SACUA and we 
don’t want to worsen that,” 
Wright said. “It may come 
close to looking like a quota, 
but perhaps we should consider 
taking gender into account.”

Ultimately, SACUA agreed on 

four possible courses of action 
that will be presented to the 

Senate Assembly: leave SACUA 
as a seven-person committee 
until the next formal election, 
fill the two vacant seats with 
the runners-up of the previous 
election, hold a formal election 
for the two seats or fill only one 
of the seats.

The 
discussion 
will 
be 

continued and voted upon 
at the next Senate Assembly 
meeting on December 12.

In his remarks, DeMonner 

shifted the conversation to 
the migration from CTools to 
Canvas, which is scheduled 
to be completely finished by 
the end of fall 2017. While 
DeMonner 
said 
he 
was 

confident in the success of 
Canvas and other programs 
that the University of Michigan 
has 
contracted, 
such 
as 

Box, some SACUA members 
expressed concern regarding 

Jabrill Peppers is heading to 

New York. 

One day after the Michigan 

football 
team 
learned 
it 

would be spending the end 
of December at the Orange 
Bowl, the Wolverines’ do-it-all 
standout was announced as one 
of five finalists for the Heisman 
Trophy.

Other 
finalists 
included 

Louisville’s 
Lamar 
Jackson, 

Oklahoma’s Baker Mayfield, 
Clemson’s DeShaun Watson and 
Oklahoma’s Dede Westbrook.

After a standout redshirt 

freshman campaign, Peppers 
surged to the forefront of the 
college football world as a 
redshirt sophomore. Playing as 
a linebacker, safety, nickelback, 
running back, slot receiver and 
wildcat quarterback, Peppers 
made an impact all over the 
field 
for 
the 
sixth-ranked 

Wolverines.

He tallied 15 tackles for loss, 

four sacks, an interception, a 
punt-return touchdown, three 
rushing touchdowns and 751 
all-purpose yards.

GOVERNMENT

Though crime statistics from 

the 
University 
of 
Michigan 

home football game days follow 
no clear trajectory, police and 
students have observed trends 
such as game time and weather 

that may have influenced arrests, 
hospitalizations and ejections.

Michigan’s 
Sept. 
17 
game 

against Colorado set the season’s 
peak for medical emergencies on 
a football Saturday at 83 treated 
students, and the Oct. 1 game 
against Wisconsin set the season 
peak for ejections from the 
stadium at 64 people ejected. 

According to Joe Piersante, 

director of University Security 
Services, who manages game 
day operations, the season went 
smoothly overall but for one 
significant incident.

“Aside from the arrests made 

of the pickpocketing ring at 
the October 1 game, we did not 
encounter any significant issues,” 

he wrote in an email to the Daily.

DPSS 
spokeswoman 
Diane 

Brown pointed to several general 
factors that she said play into 
dangerous 
activity 
on 
game 

days, such as changing weather 
throughout the season.

“Over the years we have 

observed that there are several

Sabra 
Briere 
(D–Ward 
1) 

officially resigned from Ann Arbor 
City Council at Monday evening’s 
council meeting. The vacancy 
was immediately filled by Jason 
Frenzel, who will now serve the 
remaining year of Briere’s two-year 
term.

Frenzel worked for the city 

of Ann Arbor from 2001 to 
2011 as the Volunteer Outreach 
coordinator for the city’s Natural 
Area preservation program. He 
ran for City Council this year as a 
Democrat, but lost in the primary 
to 
incumbent 
Councilmember 

Sumi Kailasapathy (D-Ward 1).

At 
Monday’s 
meeting, 

Councilmember 
Chip 
Smith 

(D-Ward 5) cited his experience in 
city hall and community outreach 
as basis for their selection.

“His knowledge about very 

complex issues facing not only the 
first ward but the city are superior,” 
Smith said.

Following 
the 
appointment 

Frenzel said in an interview 
with the Daily he was deeply 
appreciative of the council selection 
and eager to get to work

“I am deeply honored and 

humbled to be placed in City

Scott 
Stonington, 
assistant 

professor of anthropology and 
internal 
medicine 
physician, 

explored a Thai physician’s claim 
that chronic pain doesn’t exist 
in Thailand during his lecture, 
“Toward 
Anti-Ontology: 
The 

Unmaking of Chronic Pain in 
Thailand” Monday afternoon.

While conducting fieldwork 

in Thailand, Stonington said he 
learned through a conversation 
with this physician that “there 
is no chronic pain in Thailand.” 
The lecture examined the ways in 
which Stonington found this to be 
both true and untrue.

He began the lecture by 

discussing the traditional way of 
dying in Thailand.

“Dying in the hospital is 

incredibly bad,” Stonington said. 
“Hospitals are terrible places 

to die partly because they are 
haunted by ghosts and they’re 
haunted 
by 
ghosts 
because 

(hospitals are) where bad, bad 
deaths happen.”

That fear leads many people to 

rush their loved ones home from 
the hospital before they die to 
ensure a peaceful death. This has 
led to some people taking extreme 
measures on the trip home 
from the hospital and in some 
situations, more painful deaths.

“(The patients are) mostly 

sedated: 
They’re 
sedated 
on 

opiates, 
they’re 
sedated 
on 

anesthesia, and then we take all 
of that away and we put them in 
a truck and drive them home,” 
Stonington said. “So sometimes 
we take them off and they wake 
up screaming in horrifying pain.”

In Thailand, patients aren’t 

allowed to take any opiates home 
with them due to a law banning all 
opiate use and possession outside 

of a hospital, with the exception of 
treating pain linked to cancer.

Throughout 
the 
lecture, 

Stonington 
referred 
back 
to 

Western 
medicine 
and 
the 

differences between Western and 
Thai medicine to further delve 
into chronic pain in Thailand. 
Will Thomson, a post-doctoral 
student 
in 
anthropology, 
he 

thought Stonington’s research has 
various applications to Western 
medicine, especially in context of 
an ongoing opioid epidemic in the 
U.S.

“With all the opioid addiction 

and use, rethinking the way we 
think about and experience pain 
is probably a useful medical, 
social 
and 
political 
project,” 

Thomson said.

Stonington explained the ban 

and history of opiates has a long 
history in Thailand, possibly 
dating back to the Opium Wars in 
the mid-1800s and the CIA Secret 
War in Laos.

More 
recently, 
in 
2003, 

Thaksin Shinawatra, then-Prime 
Minister of Thailand, launched 
a war on drugs, giving the 
police permission to kill anyone 
suspected of an association with 
the drug trade,which has lead 
to roughly 2,500 extrajudicial 
killings.

In general, Stonington said, 

definitions of pain in Thailand are 
different.

“We 
don’t 
have 
that 
in 

Thailand,” 
Stongington 
said. 

“Chronic pain is a Western 
invention. You can say that 
something hurts, but pain itself is 
not a thing. It’s just a judgment.”

Information graduate student 

Pei-Yao Hung said she appreciated 
Stonington’s 
comparisons 

between differing perspectives 
on medicine.

“I come from Taiwan and so 

it was interesting to see people 
bringing Western medicines into 
perspective and try to understand 
it … in a different kind of context,” 
Hong said.

BOWLING WITH BUMPERS. puzzle by sudokusyndication.com

Thursday, the University 

of Michigan Board of Regents 

will hold their final meeting 

of the calendar year. The 

board is set to hear proposals 

including renovations to the 

Law Quad, approval of the 

schematic design for the new 

William 
Monroe 
Trotter 

Multicultural 
Center 
and 

approval for an honorary law 

degree to U.S. Supreme Court 

Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

If approved, Sotomayor is 

slated to receive the honorary 

degree on Jan. 20, 2017 at 

the Presidential Bicentennial 

Colloquium.

The Law Quad proposal, 

submitted by Chief Financial 

Officer 
Kevin 
Hegarty, 

calls for improvements to 

walkways, exterior lighting 

and underground utilities and 

is slated to cost 6.2 million 

dollars.

 
“The 
iconic 
Law 

Quad 
is 
in 
need 
of 

significant 
infrastructure 

improvements,” 
Hegarty 

wrote in the request. “This 

project proposes to refurbish 

the historic exterior building 

lights 
at 
all 
entrances, 

install 
Collegiate 
Gothic 

style light poles, and replace 

deteriorated walkways with 

bluestone pavers.”

 The proposed project will 

also repair and replace storm 

sewers, 
electrical 
issues 

and tunnels. A total of 25 

on-site construction jobs are 

scheduled to be completed in 

the Law Quad by fall of 2017.

 Additionally, E. Royster 

Harper, 
vice 
president 
of 

student 
life, 
and 
Hegarty 

are seeking approval for the 

schematic design of the new 

Trotter Multicultural Center. 

Last 
Dec., 
the 
Board 
of 

Regents approved the project 

to replace the old center’s 

facilities. The new Center 

will 
have 
a 
multipurpose 

room 
for 
events 
and 

conferences, along with an 

active learning configuration. 

Its construction has caused 

mixed 
reactions 
from 

students 
of 
campus, 
who 

worry the construction will 

add traffic and commotion 

to an otherwise quant area. 

In Winter 2014, the Black 

Student Union called for the 

relocation of Trotter as part 

of the #BBUM movement — 

a student-driven campaign 

sharing the experiences of 

Black students on campus.

 “The proposed William 

Monroe Trotter Multicultural 

Center is a result of extensive 

outreach 
and 
input 
from 

a variety of constituents,” 

Harper and Hegarty wrote. 

“Engagement included four 

town halls, eight focus group 

sessions, 
benchmarking 
to 

other university multicultural 

centers, 
and 
a 
survey 
of 

students.”

 The 20,000 gross square 

foot 
project, 
located 
on 

State Street near the Kelsey 

Museum of Archaeology, is 

slated to cost $10 million, 

and will include 13 on-site 

construction 
jobs. 
The 

construction is set to be 

completed in the fall of 2018.

covering the tuition for children 
to attend charter or private 
schools. The practice is highly 
criticized, as leading to the 
defunding of public schools.

In a statement following her 

appointment, 
DeVos 
stressed 

she was dedicated to bolstering 
education.

“I am very excited to get 

to work and to talk about my 
thoughts and ideas on making 
American education great again,” 
DeVos said. “The status quo is 
not acceptable. I am committed 
to transforming our education 
system into the best in the world.”

The DeVos’s were also donors 

to the Trump campaign.

Norton has worked with other 

Michigan parents and activists 
for increased funding of public 
schools while working primarily 
with grassroots organizations 
and state legislature. He said 
he frequently comes up against 
DeVos-funded groups such as the 
Great Lakes Education Project.

“It’s really stunning to see 

folks out there who honestly 
believe public schools ought to 
be eliminated and left only to the 
hopeless cases,” he said. “And 
everyone feels like they ought to 
be in private schools. The people, 
through 
their 
government, 

should have no role in actually 
operating the schools. I find that 
dismaying.”

He also noted DeVos served 

as the chairwoman for the 
Michigan Republican Party in 
the 1990s, and her connection to 
the party and her fortune make 
it easier to pass her policies and 

spread her influence.

“When they have such a strong 

influence on one political party 
and that political party controls 
the state government, they can 
do a lot of things they want to 
do,” Norton said. “And it has been 
a constant fight and I would say 
we probably lost more than we 
won.”

Erin Wright, a teacher at Ann 

Arbor public school Eberwhite 
Elementary, said she thought 
DeVos’s influence on the state 
with schools of choice and 
vouchers has led to an increase in 

racial and class segregation.

“I would say her actions at the 

state level have been detrimental 
to the public schools,” she said. 
“They 
have 
been 
funneling 

millions of dollars to charter 
schools 
which 
have 
little 

oversight 
and 
therefore 
are 

typically not successful and have 
sometimes have lower (scoring) 
schools than our public schools. 
And I am worried about that on a 
national scale.”

LSA 
junior 
Grant 
Strobl, 

national chairman of the Young 
Americans for Freedom board of 
governors, said he was thrilled to 
hear about DeVos’ appointment. 

“Frankly, the ineptitude and 

corruption of the Detroit Public 
Schools 
has 
squandered 
the 

future of generations of Detroit’s 
children. Unfortunately, Detroit 
is not alone,” he wrote in an 
email. “Many public schools in 
this country are keeping children 
in the cycle of poverty. I am 
confident Betsy DeVos will be 
innovative, including the possible 
creation of a voucher program, 
to give each child the education 
they need and deserve.” 

Michigan 
currently 
has 
a 

lenient schools of choice policy, 
giving citizens the ability to 
choose what district they want 
their children to attend. However, 
there is a ban on vouchers in the 
state constitution, which the 
DeVos family has been working 
to repeal.

Wright said DeVos’s hometown 

of Holland has had a high number 
of public schools shut down 
because of her influence.

In 
Holland, 
schools 
of 

choice have led to high rates of 
segregation and multiple public 
school 
shutdowns. 
According 

to the Holland Sentinel, white 
students started leaving Holland 
schools for less diverse districts, 
a phenomenon generally referred 
to as “white flight.” Michigan’s 
schools are also facing troubles 
academically, as the state is 
currently falling behind in early 
reading rates and has shown 
negative growth since 2003.

Norton noted that Michigan 

differs from most states as the 
state calculates a school’s budget 
based on how many students they 
have. For example, in the average 
Michigan school, a student is 
worth $7,500. If a child leaves, 
however, the money leaves with 
them and the public school loses 
the $7,500.

Wright said she thinks DeVos’s 

argument that competition in 
schools leads to more innovation 
is faulty, since most public 
schools, which do not have the 
resources to pursue different 
types of learning and unique 
programs. She added that she 
thinks DeVos is doing nothing to 
help public schools become more 
innovative.

“I am concerned (about) our 

public schools, while not perfect 
(they) 
still 
have 
wonderful 

attributes about them,” Wright 
said. “When we take resources 
away from them with vouchers 
and schools of choice and give 
money to other types of schools, 
the public schools that are 
struggling then have absolutely 
no chance to correct and do 
better. So we are just starving 
schools who are struggling and 
that’s not going to help them get 
better. That is just going to end 
the schools.”

Wright 
also 
said 
DeVos 

strongly 
supports 
Christian 

private schools. Both she and 
Norton agreed this could lead to 
a further strain on the separation 
of church and state doctrine. 
Wright added that it could 
create more funding for religious 
schools over public schools.

“I can’t foresee myself teaching 

at a private religious school ever,” 
Wright said. “I would be looking a 
different career. I hope that is not 
what happens to public schools. I 
hope that our country recognizes 
the value of all different types 
of schools, public schools being 
the main option provided for 
our country for decades of well-
educated citizens.”

Public Policy junior Nadine 

Jawad, who is the co-president 
and co-founder of Books for a 

Benefit, a program that provides 
supplies and workshops to cities 
like Dearborn, Dearborn Heights 
and Detroit, echoed the criticism.

“I think (DeVos’s policies) 

can be very, very detrimental 
to marginalized communities 
across the United States but 
especially 
in 
Michigan, 
like 

Detroit and other communities 
here,” Jawad said.

Jawad said the voucher system 

is only successful for families 
who can pay the difference 
between a public and private 
school education. Voucher money 

would come from the government 
and then families are left to pay 
the rest of the private school’s 
fee. This, Jawad argues, leads to 
more socioeconomic inequality. 

“Even the idea of what she is 

trying to do is, I think, is terrible,” 
she said. “Right now, Michigan 
ranks 42nd in terms of public 
education quality. And if we are 
the 42nd state and we know that 
there are public schools that are 
lagging behind, it doesn’t make 
sense that she wants to create 
an even larger division and even 
more inequality.”

DeVos’s 
appointment 
has 

also been criticized by the 
American Civil Liberties Union 
and the American Federation of 
Teachers. AFT President Randi 

Weingarten 
denounced 
the 

choice in a press release.

“DeVos has no meaningful 

experience in the classroom or 
in our schools,” she wrote on 
the AFT website. “The sum total 
of her involvement has been 
spending her family’s wealth 
in an effort to dismantle public 
education in Michigan. Every 
American should be concerned 
that she would impose her 
reckless and extreme ideology on 
the nation.”

However, conservatives like 

Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander 
(R) have said they appreciate 
DeVos for her small government 
policies. State Rep. Bill Huizenga 
(R–Mich.) said on his website 
DeVos’ 
policies 
would 
help 

children get quality education 
“no matter their zip code” and 
that she will “disrupt business as 
usual in Washington.”

Norton said his group’s next 

steps are to reach out to other 
education activists on a national 
level and inform others of their 
experiences in Michigan.

“(Our board hopes to) let 

people know precisely what 
this means,” Norton said. “I 
think that a lot of people in the 
country from other states didn’t 
really understand how extreme 
this choice was, how extreme 
the positions of DeVos and her 
husband and colleagues are.”

Though 
his 
appointment 

of DeVos has been met with 
much criticism, especially from 
educators and activists, Trump 
said in a statement that DeVos 
is “a brilliant and passionate 
education advocate” and will be 
able to “break the bureaucracy 
that is holding our children 
back.”

factors 
that 
may 
contribute 

to behavior from fans — the 
weather, which could include 
hot, cold, rain, sleet, snow,” she 
said. “They tend to impact how 
much people might consume, 
how much alcohol and food and 
how much they might participate 
in other activities. If it’s raining, 
sleeting and snowing in the same 
game, a lot of people won’t stay or 
won’t even come.”

Business sophomore Maxwell 

Frenkel said he was surprised at 
the statistics from the final home 
game against Indiana given the 
snowy weather. Fifty-one people 
were 
treated 
by 
emergency 

medical responders.

“For Indiana, the number of 

individuals treated wasn’t high, 
but it wasn’t super low,” he said. 
“That was a freezing day and a 
lot of people I know didn’t go 
to the game. Most people didn’t 
want to sit in the stadium. A lot of 
people watched at home. So I’m 
surprised the numbers are still 
somewhat high.”

According to Brown, kickoff 

times also play a big role. She said 
games that start at 3:30 p.m. tend 
to have more enforcement action 
than games that begin at noon.

Engineering freshman Sam 

Harris said he thought there 
was 
a 
simple 
reason 
start 

time of games was significant 
in understanding why more 
students might be treated for a 
medical emergency. The football 
games on Sept. 3 and Sept. 10, 
which started at noon, found 74 
and 55 individuals, respectively, 
treated by emergency medical 
responders, 
while 
at 
the 

following two games on Sept. 
17 and Sept. 24, which started 
at 3:30 p.m., 83 and 76 people, 
respectively, were treated.

“It seems for 3:30 games, 

there are more people taken to 

the hospital, probably because 
there’s more time to drink and 
party,” he said.

This year specifically, the 

first five football games were all 
played at home, something Brown 
said is almost unprecedented.

“At the beginning of the 

semester, students and others 
might not be quite so busy with 
other activities as they are at 
other times of the year,” she said.

Noting that only 11 people 

were transported to the hospital 
during the first game against 
Hawaii, Frenkel said he thinks 
this makes sense given it was the 
first of the season.

“The most individuals were 

taken to the hospital at the 
Hawaii game probably because 
it’s the first game of the year so a 
lot of people are coming back,” he 
said. “They haven’t been drinking 
and partying over the summer, 
so they may go especially hard. 
It’s welcome weekend.”

Brown said the intensity of the 

rivalry between the schools can 
contribute to more drinking and 
partying as well.

“There were opponents that 

we didn’t play at home this year 
where we have been known 
to have to deal with more 
enforcement action,” she said.

Similarly, 
Frankel 
said 

the Big Ten rivalry between 
Wisconsin and Michigan, as well 
as the relatively small distance 
between the schools, could have 
contributed to the 64 people 
ejected from the stadium — more 

than in any other game. 

“There were an abnormally 

large amount of ejections at 
the Wisconsin game, probably 
because a lot of Wisconsin fans 
travel here,” he said. “It was 
one of the first big games of the 
season.”

Harris said he expected there 

would be more arrests during the 
Indiana game since it is also a Big 
Ten school, but as Brown noted, 
the snowy weather could have 
played a role. There were only 
two arrests during this game 
— the second lowest number of 
arrests all season and the lowest 
in a Big Ten game.

“There 
aren’t 
that 
many 

arrests for Indiana,” he said. 
“You’d expect because it’s a Big 
Ten that there would be a lot of 
people doing stupid stuff.”

In response to high alcohol 

consumption on game days, 
University groups have taken 
on several initiatives to increase 
student safety.

This year, Central Student 

Government 
hosted 
a 
sober 

tailgate before the Colorado 
game. CSG has also taken other 
initiatives to keep students safe 
during high-risk times, including 
Hydration 
stations 
outside 

Greek life housing on game days 
through a joint effort between 
CSG and the Interfraternity 
Council.

Public Policy senior Joe Shea, 

CSG communications director, 
said CSG tries to keep students 
safe in any way they can, though 
he noted the police are ultimately 
responsible for student safety in 
these instances.

“Our goal is to try to get 

students to be responsible on 
game days and we saw this as 
an opportunity to promote a 
fun event where students can 
come out, have some pizza, stay 
hydrated and have fun,” he said.

A stellar start to the season 

buoyed many of those numbers. 
In the month of September alone, 
he recorded 9.5 tackles for loss, 
returned a punt for a touchdown 
and totaled a whopping 332 all-
purpose yards, setting the stage 
for early Heisman hype.

That hype reached a boiling 

point at Rutgers, when Peppers 
ran for two touchdowns in his 
home state of New Jersey. After 
the game, Michigan coach Jim 
Harbaugh declared that Peppers 
should be in New York for the 
Heisman ceremony. Now, he will 
be.

Jackson, a quarterback from 

Louisville, is considered the 

favorite to win the award after a 
year in which he tallied 51 total 
touchdowns. 
Twenty-one 
of 

those scores came on the ground.

Jackson and the Cardinals 

were long projected to face 
off against Peppers and the 
Wolverines in the Orange Bowl, 
but after Louisville lost its season 
finale to Kentucky, Florida State 
earned the berth instead.

Watson, a returning finalist 

from a year ago, came on strong 
late to clinch another standout 
season for the Tigers. Playing 
against Virginia Tech in the 
Atlantic 
Coast 
Conference 

Championship Game, Watson’s 
stellar passing — particularly on 
third downs — kept the Hokies 
at bay and sent his team to the 
College Football Playoff.

The Sooners had two finalists, 

sending a tandem to New York 
that would have been hard 
to 
separate. 
Mayfield 
and 

Westbrook were as dynamic 
a combo as existed in college 
football.

Westbrook 
hauled 
in 
16 

touchdowns 
for 
Oklahoma, 

and 
Mayfield 
threw 
38, 

limiting himself to just eight 
interceptions.

As 
a 
primarily 
defensive 

player, Peppers is not likely to 
take home the trophy from New 
York, though the most recent 
defensive player to win the 
award also went to Michigan — 
Charles Woodson in 1997.

Desmond Howard (1991) and 

Tom Harmon (1940) are the 
other Wolverines to win the 
award.

the programs.

“I think the system sucks,” 

said David Potter, professor of 
classical studies. “The reason 
we’re using (Box) is because 
we’re not able to use CTools 
and we’re being shoved into a 
system that doesn’t seem to be as 
functional as the old system.”

Szymanski, 
who 
also 

frequently 
uses 
Box, 
an 

online file sharing and project 
management tool, was surprised 
that it is being used for anything 

more than information sharing.

“It’s a sharing device, isn’t 

it?” Szymanski asked. “It’s not a 

device for filtering information. 
I’m just shocked to hear it’s 
being used for administrative 

purposes. I use it all the time for 
storing data and sharing with 
researchers. Are you kidding 
me, that it has an administrative 
function?”

DeMonner’s overall response 

to 
the 
concerns 
was 
that 

problems associated with these 
new programs can be attributed 
to a lack of knowledge about 
how to use them, making better 
training the solution.

“There could be problems 

with any of these programs if 
they are misused, but that’s 
more of a training problem than 
an intrinsic problem with the 
program,” DeMonner said.

Stonington also bought in personal 
stories in relation to the ideas of 
Thai physicians, such as one of a 
man who had abdominal pain, but 
his pain was not treated until the 
day he found out he had pancreatic 
cancer.

“He said, ‘That day was the best 

day of my life,’ ” Stonington said. “It 
shifted him from this category, of 

pain that wasn’t being treated, into 
cancer pain.”

Stonington also shared another 

story of a 76-year-old woman who 
went to the doctor because of 
pain in her legs. After two visits of 
telling the doctor of her pain, she 
received no help. After a third visit, 
when she told the doctor her legs 
felt “slow,” she received treatment 
and had an X-ray taken on her legs.

“‘I don’t like taking X-rays, 

especially for pain,’” Stonington 
said a Thai doctor told him.

Stonington 
concluded 
the 

lecture by posing a question 
to the audience about what he 
characterized as the overall issue 
at hand — his attempts to try to 
make sense owf something that 
exists, yet is actively erased.

“How do you make sense of 

sort of a silence where everyone 
knows that something exists but no 
one can name it or talk about it or 
identify it?” he said.

“I am committed

“I can’t forsee

Council,” Frenzel said. “It is a 
very strange process to go through 
being appointed in comparisons 
to running and being elected, and 
obviously the timeline has been very 
fast and there is only eleven months 
for the appointment by mind is both 
spinning in the humbleness and the 
work to be done.”

Last month, Briere announced 

her intention to resign at the Dec. 
5 City Council meeting to move to 
California. After the announcement 
was 
made, 
the 
city 
opened 

applications to fill the soon-to-be-
vacant seat. Seven Ward 1 residents 
– K.C. Lopata, Brent Eliason, Jason 
Frenzel, Charles Bultman, Jeff 
Hayner, David Moya, and Taha 
Hussain – applied for the position. 
All seven were interviewed by 
the council on Nov. 28 at a public 
meeting.

The meeting began with a tribute 

to Briere’s service on council from 
state Sen. Rebekah Warren (D–Ann 
Arbor) and state Rep. Jeff Irwin 
(D–Ann Arbor), thanking Briere 
for the work she has done in the 
community and wishing her the 
best in her move to California.

In the last hour of the meeting, 

Briere offered a resolution declaring 
her resignation. After the council 
approved the resolution, Briere 
stepped away from her seat and 
Council 
began 
discussion 
on 

selecting a replacement.

In an interview in a November, 

Briere said she began working with 
city officials early on when she 
decided she would be vacating her 
seat.

“In other situations in the past, 

people have moved and resigned, 
but because I have full warning 
and I’m the kind of person I am, 
when I understood that my son 
was successful in purchasing the 
house and I had a basic idea of when 
I would move, I worked with the 
Mayor and the city administrator 
and the city attorney to create a 
reasonable process proposal, and 
council then looked at that process 
 

proposal and improved it,” Briere 
said.

A large portion of the meeting 

before 
the 
vote 
on 
Briere’s 

replacement was focused on an 
ordinance to rezone 5.34 acres 
of land from a Township District 
land to a Multiple-Family Housing 
District to allow for the creation of 
a three-story, 75-unit condominium 
structure as well as the development 
of a regional water basin, which was 
approved with an 8-3 vote. During 
public comment, a dozen residents 
of the Ascot Road/Village Oaks 
Court area, where the proposed 
development would be built, urged 
the council to vote down the zoning 
ordinance.

The residents argued that the 

development would be damaging 
to the area’s water systems and 
would change the appearance of 
a neighborhood that is all single-
family homes. Many argued that 
the creation of a water detention 
center would be beneficial for some 

residents of the area but would 
create far worse problems for those 
near the new development, leading 
to more flooding.

Paula Uche, an Ann Arbor 

resident who spoke twice during 
the public comment section, said 
after the vote that he thought 
the Council’s decision to pass 
this ordinance disregarded their 
ethical duty and the voices of their 
constituents.

“The city has cut a deal with 

a very wealthy developer, who is 
going to get even wealthier with his 
$75,000-a-year condos, when the 
rest of us who suffered to pay off 
our houses are going to get flooded 
again 
because 
(the 
council’s) 

decision totally ignores one section 
of the area and have neglected 
our complaints, our concerns, our 
warnings,” Uche said. 

Councilmembers Jack Eaton (D–

Ward 4), Sumi Kailasapathy (D–
Ward 1) and Jane Lumm (I–Ward 
2) voted against the ordinance. The 
dissenting council members echoed 
the concerns of the residents that 
spoke. Eaton also stated that this 
rezoning goes against the city’s 
overarching master plan.

However, 
Councilmember 

Graydon Kraphol (D-Ward 4), who 
voted in support of the proposal, 
argued that the master plan is a 
guide, not meant to be interpreted 
as an absolute. Smith also noted 
that that just because the area is 
currently dominated by single-
family dwellings does not mean 
non-single family housing is at risk. 

COUNCIL

ith 
the 
election 

over, there is finally 
a 
moment 
when 

both major political parties can 
examine their current standings 
and future paths. What is so 
fascinating about the 
2016 election is that 
the Republican Party 
was not expected to 
win the presidency 
nor retain the Senate; 
some even speculated 
the 
House 
of 

Representatives was 
in jeopardy. Yet in 
a shocking manner, 
the Republican Party 
kept 
both 
houses 

of 
Congress 
and 

recaptured the presidency.

When the new administration 

and a new Congress are sworn 
in this January, Republicans 
will control the White House, 
Congress, 33 governorships and 
have full legislative control in 32 
states. That is a remarkable gain 
in a time when the Republican 
Party was said to be in deep 
trouble 
with 
the 
American 

electorate. Just a few months ago, 
many questioned the relevancy 
of the party — often predicting 
a complete reform of the right 
side of the political aisle. Yet the 
opposite happened; momentum 
since the 2010 midterms has 
carried the Republican Party to 
historic levels of power.

Despite 
these 
victories, 

the GOP still needs to remain 
focused. 
By 
keeping 
their 

eye on both future electoral 
strategies and upcoming policy 
opportunities, 
the 
party 
is 

poised to solidify its control on 
the nation’s institutions for the 
next decade.

In terms of electoral strategy, 

Republicans 
certainly 
have 

much to be optimistic about. 
Trump was able to win over 300 
electoral votes; he outperformed 
with Latinos and women and 
unexpectedly mobilized turnout 
in Rust Belt states. However, the 
party cannot take these gains for 
granted. In future elections, the 
GOP needs to remain focused 
on continually expanding our 
party. While we made inroads 
with minorities, we still have 
plenty of room to grow. We need 
to prove to the Midwestern 
working class, many of whom 
were Democrats who voted for 
Trump, that the GOP is the party 
that truly represents them. This 
election gives us the opportunity 

to shed the wrongly applied labels 
of corporatist elites and gives 
us a path to prove that we have 
the policies that actually help 
American lives.

In 
addition 
to 
successful 

outreach to different 
groups 
of 
people, 

the party’s bench is 
also 
strong. 
While 

many ridiculed the 
nomination processes 
for having so many 
candidates, it proves 
that we have youth 
in 
the 
party 
that 

will 
eventually 
be 

able to lead. Look 
at 
Congress, 
for 

example. 
Members 

like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, 
Speaker of the House Paul 
Ryan, Utah Rep. Mia Love 
and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst are 
stars within the party and they 
have the power to continue the 
party’s momentum in upcoming 
elections. 

But 
in 
order 
to 
remain 

electorally successful, we need 
to succeed on policy. If the GOP 
doesn’t follow through on many 
of its promises, this will be a 
wasted opportunity. Whether 
it be repealing and replacing 
Obamacare, securing the border, 
reforming 
the 
tax 
code 
or 

appointing 
very 
conservative 

Supreme 
Court 
justices, 
the 

party will match the left’s course 
of achieving little if it doesn’t 
implement significant changes 
to current policy, if not replace 
policies entirely.

In 
my 
opinion, 
as 
a 

conservative 
Republican, 
we 

cannot miss out on the chance to 
implement new policies. Every 
dollar taken out of my small 
paycheck makes a difference. 
A simpler, reformed tax system 
would go a long way to help out 
students across the country. 
Repealing 
and 
replacing 

Obamacare 
would 
jumpstart 

the hiring market, as many 
businesses have cut hours to 
get around certain Obamacare 
requirements. As a millennial 
who 
has 
experienced 
this 

phenomenon personally — a cut 
in my hours and pay because 
of new Obamacare regulations 
— I believe the GOP has so 
much potential to both help the 
country through its policies and 
solidify a moderate portion of 
the electorate.

The Republican Party also has 

a rare opportunity to reshape 
the political debate. Hopefully, 
the party will be able to shift 
the nation’s attention toward 
economic 
and 
international 

issues. Moving away from many 
social issues will allow the 
party to put forth solutions on 
the issues that matter more to 
those on the right. The party, by 
maintaining a commitment to 
promised policy changes, can 
potentially solidify a voting bloc 
by restructuring the importance 
of different political issues with 
many different groups, especially 
students and younger people 
who are fiscally conservative and 
socially moderate.

This said, one major question 

that remains is that of which 
path the party should take in 
the coming years. Does the 
party become more moderate 
on social issues in hopes of 
solidifying a large proportion 
of the youth that considers 
itself Libertarian? Do Trump’s 
nationalist 
views 
take 
over 

and remain a constant driver 
of policy for the foreseeable 
future? Or does Reagan’s party 
return to his principles and 
move farther to the right?

It’s impossible to predict 

which path we will take. It will 
become clearer, however, as 
Trump implements his policies. 
Without clear proposals, it’s 
anyone’s guess as to what type of 
Republican he chooses to be, and 
if the party as a whole chooses 
to follow him. Nevertheless, it 
is obvious that the Republican 
Party is not as weak as many 
predicted before the election. 
With dominant control over 
America’s institutions and the 
potential for the implementation 
of solid policies, the Republican 
Party seems poised to be the 
party of the future.

DAPL— what you can do

CHASE STONE | OP-ED

E

arly 
Sunday, 
the 

U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers 
announced 

that the easement permit for 
construction of the Dakota 
Access 
Pipeline 
would 
be 

denied, 
temporarily 
halting 

construction 
by 
Energy 

Transfer 
Partners. 
The 

corps 
will 
now 
perform 

an 
environmental 
impact 

statement 
in 
the 
coming 

months, 
though 
President-

elect 
Donald 
Trump’s 

administration 
will 
present 

inevitable 
challenges 
to 

environmental 
protection, 

specifically for the DAPL. In 
the wake of the permit denial, 
many of us will ask: Is this the 
end of the DAPL? And, frankly, 
how can we doing anything 
about it, 1,000 miles away in 
Ann Arbor?

I’m 
a 
graduate 
student 

at 
the 
School 
of 
Natural 

Resources and Environment 
and 
a 
graduate 
student 

instructor 
for 
the 
Honors 

Program. 
Since 
September, 

I’ve 
been 
co-producing 
a 

feature 
documentary 
film 

called “Standing Ground” on 
the DAPL with director Raviv 
Ullman and producers Martin 
Spanjers and Jordan Harkins. 
Each of us are unaffiliated 
with the Standing Rock Sioux; 
however, we gained support 
from more than 800 individuals 
on Kickstarter to help us cover 
the DAPL protest on film. 
My 
responsibilities 
include 

managing research projects, 
summarizing 
environmental 

policies, sourcing interviews 

and 
relaying 
newsworthy 

updates. But, despite all the time 
I’ve spent devoted to the DAPL 
documentary this semester, I 
freely admit: I’ve never even 
been to Standing Rock or set foot 
in North Dakota.

At Michigan, many of us 

are informed by the books we 
read, people we talk to and the 
geographic location we live in. 
Some of us spend our days in 
lab mixing solvents and others 
pore over Excel spreadsheets; 
but no matter what we’re 
doing, the time we have on 
our hands right now can be 
just as impactful outside the 
classroom as inside it.

We have no shortage of 

students 
devoted 
to 
their 

studies, 
well 
deserving 
of 

the “Leaders and the Best” 
moniker. 
Similar 
to 
my 

peers, the time I’ve spent on 
the documentary has been 
productive, but has incurred 
costs: I’ve gotten more Bs and 
Cs this semester than ever, 
I average five to six hours of 
sleep most nights, and lately, 
I’ve forgone most solid food 
in favor of Soylent because I’m 
too busy to cook.

However, I’ve also been 

one of the first people outside 
Standing Rock to see the footage 
of water cannons being sprayed 
at protesters and share it with 
the world. I’ve connected with 
artists, 
Congress 
members 

and 
activists; 
I’ve 
written 

fact-checks to the Los Angeles 
Times, learned how to treat 
mace in the eyes (use milk) and 
inquired at least once about 
purchasing “drone insurance” 
(yes, it exists). So, when the 
Army 
Corps 
released 
its 

statement on Sunday, despite 
being 
cautiously 
optimistic, 

for the first time, I got to share 
the taste of a small victory 
along with many others, but 
more specifically, a victory 
belonging to the tribes. 

Over the next six to 18 

months, the predicted time 
period for the Army Corps’ 
Enivornmental 
Impact 

Statement to take place on the 
DAPL, consider your potential 
role — not just on this issue, 
necessarily, but in the context 
of the world. Dropping out of 
school is reserved for geniuses 
beginning their tech startup. 
Maybe 
instead, 
consider 

dropping 
your 
six-week 

internship to do something 
you’re actually called to do. 
My roommate’s father — a 
Michigan alum — once built a 
sailboat in the 1970s to travel 
around the world over summer 
break. 
He 
later 
became 

successful 
as 
a 
financial 

adviser. My point is that one’s 
“professional” identity is not 
one’s main identity — and that’s 
the reason why I am doing what 
I’m doing now. It is increasingly 
apparent that students feel 
pressure to find a job and a set 
of skills, or else they will lose 
out on something, when in fact, 
it might be the opposite. The 
Army Corps’ Enivornmental 
Impact Statement may or may 
not be favorable to the Standing 
Rock Sioux, and whether you 
are for the pipeline or against 
it, what is important is that no 
one stands complacent.

FROM THE DAILY

Block DeVos’ appointment

O 

n Nov. 23, President-elect Donald Trump officially announced 
his nomination for secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, 
sparking fierce criticisms from proponents of public education 

— including residents of Michigan, where the issue of public education 
is in need of so much attention. During her time as chairwoman of the 
Michigan Republican Party, DeVos fiercely championed the notion 
of schools of choice and student voucher programs, which funnel 
government funds initially set aside for public schools toward private 
and charter schools. DeVos seems to be blind to the fact that in her 
home state of Michigan, privatization programs have historically failed 
to reform education systems in cities such as Detroit and Flint. Despite 
clear evidence of the charter school sytem’s failures to provide equal 
education opportunities for all students, she and her family donated to 
the GOP after the Republican-led State Senate approved pro-charter 
school legislation. Considering this, as well as her lack of experience, 
The Michigan Daily’s Editorial Board opposes her appointment as 
secretary of education. But should she be voted in, we believe DeVos 
must take a critical look at the reality of Michigan school systems, 
consider the role and purpose public schools serve in the United States 
and reexamine the effectiveness of her proposals in Michigan before 
implementing similar programs nationwide.

The 
Department 
of 

Education’s mission statement 
to 
“promote 
student 

achievement and preparation 
for 
global 
competitiveness 

by 
fostering 
educational 

excellence and ensuring equal 
access” must apply to all U.S. 
citizens, not just those who 
already have access to quality 
education. 
Currently, 
while 

a schools of choice system 
in which families can have 
the option to send their child 
to charter schools in theory 
provides 
more 
opportunity, 

oftentimes 
it 
benefits 

wealthier 
families 
because 

they 
can 
afford 
to 
drive 

their child to a better school 
option. In turn, this leaves 
public 
schools 
and 
poorer 

families in a worse financial 
state. If DeVos becomes head 
of this department, she must 
uphold the mission statement 
and 
consciously 
design 
an 

educational 
system 
that 

provides resources for every 
student’s success.

Additionally, though charter 

schools 
have 
had 
success 

in Michigan, according to a 
Detroit 
Free 
Press 
report, 

charter 
schools 
are 
only 

marginally better than public 
schools. 
It’s 
alarming 
that 

despite the large failures of 
schools of choice in Michigan, 
DeVos has championed these 
initiatives as some of the best. 
DeVos 
should 
consider 
the 

implications 
her 
proposed 

policies will have on areas of 
lower socioeconomic status.

In particular, DeVos staunchly 

supports 
expanding 
the 

student voucher system that 
currently exists in 13 states 
and 
Washington 
D.C. 
On 

the campaign trail, Trump 
proposed delegating $20 billion 
in federal funds to school choice 
vouchers 
for 
K-12 
students. 

As 
secretary 
of 
education, 

DeVos 
would 
spearhead 
the 

implementation of this flawed 
solution to failing public schools. 
Despite the good intentions of 
voucher programs giving students 
opportunities to attend better 
schools, programs like these are 
risky because they channel money 
away from public schools, leading 
to a lack of quality education. 
For some families, transporting 
their children to a school outside 
their immediate district is an 
onerous task. For other families, 
charter schools don’t align with 
their values: Private and charter 
schools can be privately funded, 
and therefore are sometimes 
religiously affiliated. Students 
from low socioeconomic status 
families already face significant 
disadvantages 
in 
quality 
of 

available 
public 
education, 

because communities with lower 
socioeconomic 
status 
cannot 

always provide adequate funding 
for 
educational 
resources. 

By 
implementing 
schools 
of 

choice and an expansive private 
education system, DeVos could 
not guarantee students from 
underprivileged 
backgrounds 

would receive a better education 
with her plan than from their 
local public schools.

While 
the 
effort 
to 

transition students from public 
schools 
to 
charter 
schools 

embodies a needed spirit of 
reform in education policy, 
DeVos’s 
current 
plans 
for 

the proliferation of charter 
schools would fail to produce 
the quality education that is 
desperately needed. Private-
sector 
schools 
are 
largely 

unregulated by or accountable 
to the U.S. government, and 
create their own educational 
and teaching standards. The 
sheer lack of transparency 
in the standards being set 
is 
problematic, 
and 
poses 

significant 
challenges 
to 

reforming the U.S. education 
system. These scenarios are not 
theoretical; this is the reality 
for the Detroit area. 

The 
Michigan 
Daily 

Editorial 
Board 
opposes 

DeVos’s appointment and urges 
voters and Michigan senators 
Debbie 
Stabenow 
(D) 
and 

Gary Peters (D) to get involved 
and take action. As voters, 
we must call our senators — 
whether we are in-state or 
out-of-state students — and 
voice our opposition to DeVos’s 
confirmation. 
Michigan 

senators should take a close 
look at DeVos’s plans and how 
they are operating already 
and vote for the people. And if 
DeVos does become secretary 
of education, we implore her 
as well as ask others to ask her 
to take a better look at charter 
schools and privatization of 
education in Michigan.

TRISTAR PICTURES.

Should be Vinnie Dee up on that screen.

There’s a scene at the end of 

Wes 
Anderson’s 
“Rushmore” 

that never fails to 
feel disjointed and 
awkward, 
albeit 

on purpose. The 
protagonist, delin-
quent high school-
er and part-time 
amateur 
play-

wright Max Fisch-
er, 
is 
debuting 

his latest play, an 
epic tale from the 
Vietnam War with surprisingly 
high production values. The dia-
logue in Max’s play, “Heaven and 
Hell,” is stilted and convoluted, 
all those “-eds” that offend the 
common critic. Max’s play reads 
beautifully on paper, perhaps, but 
when acted out before an audi-
ence, when people have to actu-
ally read the lines aloud, as if they 
are speaking them in real life, 
whimsical 
mysticism 
thumbs 

over reality to a fault.

This is all to say there’s a big 

difference between the written 
and spoken word. That which is 
written is afforded a diligence 
and deliberation that allows for 
creative and expressive prose. 
Spoken word is messy and 
incomplete, with bits and pieces 
of thoughts hurriedly scrambled 
together to get one’s voice in the 
conversation.

This distinction is mangled 

in “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime 
Walk,” the latest film from direc-
tor Ang Lee (“Life of Pi”). Featur-
ing a screenplay with dialogue 
largely lifted from the original 
novel by Ben Fountain, “Billy 
Lynn” falls short as a biting war 
satire, as a drama and as a film.

The film follows the Bravo 

squad, a fictional group of Ameri-
can soldiers fighting in Iraq who 
become famous when a Fox News 
embed captures their participa-

tion in a deadly firefight. The 
footage is affecting enough to 
allow Bravo a brief respite from 
Iraqi combat; they go on a “vic-
tory tour” of sorts, culminating 
in a halftime show appearance 

behind 
Desti-

ny’s Child at the 
Thanksgiving Day 
Dallas 
Cowboys 

game.

The 
soldiers 

encounter passion-
ate patriotic fans 
commending their 
actions, 
which 

they saw on the 
news, 
while 

pledging fervent support for 
the Iraq War. Billy Lynn (new-
comer Joe Alwyn) finds love in 
a born-again cheerleader, Faison 
Zorn (Makenzie Leigh, “James 
White”). And, perhaps most 
importantly, they’re drunk — 
very, very drunk — which is the 
only way they can deal with their 
impending redeployment to Iraq 
at the conclusion of their tour.

That 
drunkenness, 
though 

emphasized in Fountain’s novel 
as perhaps the only escape from 
the doom of military service, is 
largely absent from Lee’s film. 
Bravo squad, subject to a hygien-
ic cleanse, is a sanitized version 
of their literary selves. So, too, 
is the dread of returning to Iraq, 
not as a prospect but as a satiric 
exclamation point that reduces 
the group to dead men walking, 
being celebrated for a brief stint 
at bravery. In other words, it’s 
hard to ignore that Bravo will be 
redeployed, but it’s only a loom-
ing threat, not a cosmic joke.

The film’s peculiar frame rate, 

which, at 120 frames per second, 
is five times the standard of 24 
frames per second, compounds 
confusion. The motion is overly 
smooth, but in a standard projec-
tion, it’s not particularly dizzy-
ing, just a bit distracting.

Still, the frame rate seems to 

be innovation for its own sake, 

and it isn’t used to enhance 
the story, even though the idea 
makes sense. American society 
has commercialized the spec-
tacle and language of war — the 
halftime show is filled with 
explosions and model rockets, 
and Bravo is asked if they’re 
“battle-ready” to appear in the 
show, much to the dismay of the 
soldiers. But, just as dropping a 
group of rowdy 20-somethings 
into the middle of Iraq is not the 
way to win a war, dropping a 
story into a crazy frame rate fails 
to advance cinema technology in 
any way.

The film is at times saved 

by its stars, who slip into their 
roles with a natural ease. Alwyn 
and Leigh do their best with a 
poor screenplay, but the rest of 
the squad, especially “Mango” 
(Arturo Castro, “Broad City”) 
and the group’s leader, Sergeant 
Dime (Garrett Hedlund, “Inside 
Llewyn Davis”), give the soldiers 
credibility as a ragtag bunch of 
American patriots. Chris Tucker 
(“Silver Linings Playbook”) is 
hilarious as Albert, the Holly-
wood agent trying to turn Bra-
vo’s story into a film, and Kristen 
Stewart 
(“Certain 
Women”) 

delivers a raw gut-punch of a per-
formance as Lynn’s sister, for she 
is consumed by concern for her 
little brother.

Vin Diesel (“Guardians of the 

Galaxy”) is as good as Steve Mar-
tin (“The Jerk”) is bad, a surpris-
ing turn to say the least. Diesel is 
instilled with a calming patience 
that suits his military role, while 
Martin simply seems ill-fitting 
for the role as fictional Dallas 
Cowboys owner Norm Oglesby, 
playing the wealthy Southern oil 
baron with little affect.

In the War on Terror age, we 

need war satires to digest the last 
fifteen years. But “Billy Lynn’s 
Long Halftime Walk,” more a 
filmic experiment than full-
fledged argument, falls short of 
what we deserve.

FILM REVIEW

Friday evenings were a magi-

cal time when I was young. 
Coming from a household with 
strict rules regarding weekday 
television time, Friday nights 

at five were reserved for Walt 
Disney — more specifically, 
for Disney Channel Original 
Movies (DCOMs), which con-
veniently aired right after Girl 
Scouts and just before dinner. 
It was during this time that the 
Disney channel was putting 
out its best work. From classics 

like “Smart House” and “Life 
Size,” to the heavily-franchised 
“High School Musical” and 
“Cheetah Girls,” there is no 
question that the DCOM game 
was strong — I’d go as far as to 
call it the Golden Age of Disney 
Channel.

Whether it was my fast-

DISNEY CHANNEL

“Yep, that’s me.”
Will the Disney ‘That’s So Raven’ 
reboot be relevant or just nostalgic?

Lame cash grabs of beloved childhood classics? That’s so not Raven. 

approaching 
adolescence 

or teenage rebelliousness, I 
noticed that around the time 
I distanced myself from the 
channel, Disney began to take 
an abrupt shift away from 
originality and toward high-
profit franchises. In the past 
few years, the Disney Channel 
of yore has almost blinked itself 
into obscurity, replaced by a 
channel that seems to value 
franchise-friendly 
material 

over originality.

A recent YouTube search for 

DCOMs led to the very movies 
that had made such an impres-
sion on my youth, yet they all 
had something in common: age. 
Of all the DCOM movies I had 
searched for, none of the more 
celebrated films were spectac-
ularly new, with the majority 
settling somewhere around the 
late 1990s to the early 2000s. 
In the year 2000, the Disney 
Channel released 12 DCOMs: 
one for every month of the 
year. Although recent material 
is still being tossed out by the 
channel at a steady rate, one 
has to wonder where the magic 
went.

From 2003 to 2007, the Dis-

ney Channel entertained with 
one of its better-known series, 
“That’s So Raven,” a hit live-
action sitcom detailing the 
antics of teen psychic Raven 

Baxter (Raven-Symoné, “The 
View”) as she navigated life, 
love and family. Growing up, 
the series was essential to my 
pre-adolescent angst — wheth-
er it was through the close 
scrapes the gang had with their 
parents or the trials being an 
outcast in high school could 
bring, Raven was relatable 
above all else.

So 
when 
Raven-Symoné 

recently announced her plans 
to depart the daytime talk show 
“The View” to work full-time 
on a “That’s So Raven” spin-off 
series, I originally celebrated 
her return to Disney. I would 
gladly support anything to bring 
back nostalgia. However, there 
is a question of originality still 
at play here. Take “Boy Meets 
World,” which was developed 
into the spinoff “Girl Meets 
World” in 2014. Though “Boy 
Meets World” was a staple of the 
vintage Disney Channel, revival 
programs still beg the question 
— when is originality tossed 
aside in favor of nostalgia?

When 
production 
details 

began flooding social media, 
my nostalgia turned quickly to 
déjà vu, as the plot suspiciously 
follows the storyline for Net-
flix’s revival series, “Fuller 
House.” And though “Fuller 
House” 
promised 
nostalgia, 

many fans were left disap-

pointed, as the series had little 
to offer in terms of new mate-
rial in the premiere season. 
It’s this lack of originality that 
sparks my concerns for “That’s 
So Raven” — what can this 
spin-off bring us that “That’s 
So Raven” hasn’t already cov-
ered? While it’s known that 
original cast members, such 
as Anneliese van der Pol’s 
(“Vampires Suck”) Chelsea will 
return, there are serious ques-
tions still left unanswered. 
How will the reboot relate to 
the original series? What gen-
eration is Disney aiming for, 
exactly?

These questions are trivial 

— answers will soon emerge as 
the series progresses further 
into production, though the 
points they raise will remain 
relevant for the new standard 
of television production. It’s 
become quite obvious over the 
years that there is a stunning 
lack of originality in the newer 
DCOMs, 
possibly 
stemming 

from the abundance of source 
material within their more 
recent series. Although I’ll be 
anticipating 
Raven-Symoné’s 

series as much as the next fan, 
I’ll be going in with a critical 
mind, yearning for a return to 
the old school Disney Channel 
and awaiting some much-need-
ed change.

MEGAN MITCHELL

Daily Arts Writer

What makes “Insecure” so 

fantastic is its nuanced storytelling, 
characterized 
by 

the 
slice-of-life 

quality 
that 
has 

become so popular 
in this most recent 
television 
season. 

The season finale, 
“Broken as F*ck” is 
no exception, using 
this quotidian trend 
to assert some of 
its most dramatic and insightful 
narrative elements.

“Broken 
as 
F*ck” 
doesn’t 

attempt to hide or justify Issa’s 
culpability in her falling out with 
Molly (Yvonne Orji, “Love That 
Girl!”) or her painful breakup with 
Lawrence (Jay Ellis, “The Game”) 
after cheating on him with Daniel 
(Y’lan Noel, “The Hustle”). Rather, 
it explores these self-inflicted 
circumstances with depth and 
poignancy.

After the previous episode’s 

jarring wake-up call, Issa is more 
than ready to redeem herself with 
Lawrence, calling him multiple 
times and even showing up at his 
office to bring by a thoughtful gift. 
But she’s not getting off the hook 
that easily, and the episode strings 
us along on the precarious hope 
that he will forgive her and they’ll 
live happily ever after.

“Insecure” isn’t about that, 

however. It’s about telling things 
how they really are, even when 
it’s not pleasant. On a girls trip for 
Kelli’s (Natasha Rothwell, “The 
Characters”) birthday, the women 
— Issa, Kelli, Molly and Tiffany 
(Amanda Seales, “My Brother 
and Me”) get unpleasantly and 
hilariously real with one another. 
Kelli and Tiffany barely hold back 
fits of cackling while pointing out 
to Molly the hypocrisy in her “new 
Molly” attitude that allows her to 
do whatever she wants and own it, 
even if it’s having a one night stand 
with a much younger man from a 
nightclub.

Tiffany and Kelli aren’t safe 

from the group’s ridicule either, 
also getting the most glaring flaws 
in their lives thrown in their faces 
during the riotous hot tub scene. 

While it may not be pretty, it ties 
into the theme of facing reality 
that has bubbled throughout the 
season and broken to the surface in 
“Broken as F*ck.” 

As Issa faces her reality, Molly 

and Lawrence are 
similarly forced to 
take a hard look 
at 
themselves. 

The 
episode 
is 

structured around 
these 
parallels, 

smartly 
binding 

each 
character’s 

harrowing journey 
to come to terms 

with what’s happened and their 
own realizations with Issa’s own 
path to contrition.

In unintentionally hurting those 

she loves most, Issa is forced to 
finally take action, in contrast to 
her stagnation throughout the 
season, and assert herself to get her 
relationship back with Lawrence 
and Molly’s forgiveness. The clever 
organization of this episode is 
extremely understated. Without 
calling attention to the painstaking 
care taken in fulfilling the show’s 
themes, the finale provides a 
smooth transition into the next 
chapter of Issa’s life following this 
season.

While it’s agonizing to see 

Issa try to face Lawrence and 
Molly’s rejection and anger over 
and over again, the repetitive, 
slow pace of the episode lends 
itself to the emotional power of 
this agony and makes Issa and 
Molly’s 
reconciliation 
all 
the 

more rewarding. It’s not a sappy 
moment either, but rather the 
quick and unexpected kind where 
the emotional reverse plays out 
as a slight, emotive gesture and a 
gratifying return to normalcy.

The 
simmering 
drama 

throughout 
the 
episode 
finds 

its comedic relief in Kelli, the 
hilarious, outspoken birthday girl 
who prompts the group of friends 
to break out of their comfort 
zones. By setting Issa and Molly’s 
conflict in the intimate setting of 
Kelly’s birthday trip, the finale 
intensifies the tension between 
the two characters while also 
cutting through it with moments of 
forthright comedy. But the humor 
isn’t enough to distract from Issa’s 
inescapable issues.

Meanwhile, Lawrence attempts 

to escape his misery at a strip club 
with his friends, a jarring setting in 
contrast to Issa’s (mostly) peaceful 
girls weekend. When Lawrence 
finally calls Issa, it’s the moment 
of relief we’ve all been waiting for 
— their reunion is imminent and 
the long, drawn-out anticipation 
will finally find a satisfying end. 
However, we’re in for a rude 
awakening 
when 
Lawrence’s 

unexpected vengeance on Issa 
reveals that he’s not the man 
neither we nor Issa believed he 
was.

Maybe “Insecure” doesn’t aim 

to tell us who its characters are, but 
who they can be. From its genesis, 
the series follows Issa through the 
ups and downs of transformative 
decisions 
and 
challenges 
in 

her 
relationship, 
career 
and 

friendships. The show has shaped 
a complex and acute character 
in Issa in just eight episodes. 
And while Issa is the protagonist 
around which the entire series is 
molded, the supporting characters 
serve an incredibly important 
role in exploring themes of love, 
life and identity in the series — 
most notably in “Broken as F*ck,” 
in which the highly conceptual 
structure thoughtfully indicates 
the robust development of the 
series’ characters.

In doing so, “Insecure” resolves 

many of the storylines it has 
carefully 
nurtured 
throughout 

the eight-episode season with 
incredible 
subtlety, 
tying 
its 

assertive ending back to the 
very beginning of the season 
by demonstrating how far its 
characters have come. The season 
finale succeeds not only because it 
does this so well, but also because 
it leaves room for uncertainty. 
Though we see an enormous 
change in Issa and in the course 
of her relationship, we’re left 
wondering what comes next for her 
following the pivotal season finale. 
 

The series strives to challenge 

Issa in the people she’s surrounded 
with. And it challenges us to think 
about what Issa’s development 
really means and what changes 
will come of it. If this season and 
its finale have shown us anything, 
it’s that we can look forward to 
watching Issa grow in engaging 
ways.

I 

walked into “Loving” con-
fident I was about to see a 
film that would blow me 

away. The trailer may or may not 
have made me cry, and I knew 
that it would add to 
discussions 
about 

the 
inequalities 

still faced by people 
of 
color, 
women, 

and especially the 
LGBTQ 
commu-

nity, in terms of civil 
rights 
surrounding 

the right to love who-
ever one does.

About 
thirty 

minutes in, I was 
sitting very still in 
my seat, restraining myself from 
craning around to see if anyone 
else was wearing a bewildered 
expression on their face.

“Loving” is based on the true 

story of Mildred Jeter, a Black 
woman, and Richard Loving, a 
white man, married in D.C. in 
1958; their interracial marriage 
is not legal in Virginia at the 
time. When the Lovings return 
to Virginia and live as a married 
couple, their home is invaded 
by local police who have been 
tipped off that they are living as 
husband and wife. Their sentence 
of a year in jail is suspended on 
the provision that they leave 
Virginia and don’t return for 25 
years.

Eventually, 
after 
years 
of 

moving and raising children in 
less than ideal circumstances, 
Mildred is inspired to write a 
letter to Bobby Kennedy. She 
is contacted by the ACLU, who 
want to use the Lovings’ story to 
launch a case that would change 
the Constitution and alter the 
course of American history — 
fighting the bans on interracial 
marriage. Spoiler alert: They are 
successful.

There were parts of “Loving” 

that 
I 
did 
appreciate. 
The 

moments with the photographer 
from Life magazine are lovely; the 
delicacy required in capturing 
the beauty of intimate moments 
to sway national public opinion 
is quietly beautiful. The actors’ 
performances themselves were 
organic and nuanced, especially 
Ruth Negga (“Warcraft”) as 
Mildred 
and 
Joel 
Edgerton 

(“Midnight Special”) as Richard. 
Negga imbues her character 
with weariness alternating with 
hope that makes your heart feel 
full. The cinematography was 
elegant if restrained, the natural, 
understated 
color 
palette 

allowing every scene to flow into 
the next.

However, I was put off by 

a few things — namely, the 
representation 
of 
Mildred’s 

character. The film starts when 
the two protagonists are already 
in a committed relationship; we 
are supposed to know that they 

are very much in love. But the 
film never really establishes the 
intimacy of the relationship. 
The two barely talk; they never 
make each other laugh; I don’t 

think there is a single 
instance of Richard 
talking to his children; 
there are so many 
lingering close-ups of 
Mildred’s 
concerned 

face that they begin 
to feel almost stale. 
Often, the beauty of 
a shot seemed to be 
held in her reserved 
femininity 
or 
her 

motherhood, 
rather 

than in her constant 

strength 
through 
emotional 

labor.

Of course, as this was based on 

a true story, it can be argued that 
if the real Mildred was a reticent 
woman, 
then 
her 
character 

shouldn’t have to be changed, 
or made larger than life. This 
is true; timid or soft-spoken 
women can be just as strong as 
the loudest woman in the room. 
The stories of regular, everyday 
people are just as important 
to tell as the stories of people 
whose names and faces are in 
our history textbooks; arguably 
even more so, as the Western 
education of history has been 
studied 
and 
taught 
through 

only the lens of the Great White 
Man and What He Did for His 
Country and thereby ignored the 
contributions and importance of 
everyone else for so long.

But there are ways to tell the 

stories of the everyday woman 
without making her seem passive. 
There are ways to portray a timid 
woman without taking away her 
voice almost completely. The 
composition of several of film’s 
shots were shocking to me. There 
are too many shots in which 
Mildred is tiny and cramped up 
into a corner of the frame. Even 
when she is allowed to take up 
more space on screen, there are 
more shots of her blinking than 
talking.

The film ends with a quote from 

Mildred that says, “I miss him. He 
took care of me.” After that, the 
screen fades to black and credits 
roll. Of course, she said this in 
real life. But when an entire movie 
portrays a person who should have 
been more of a focal point of the 
film from the get-go as so passive, 
this cherry-picked quote was the 
wrong one to use.

The one time it is pointed out 

that Mildred had a lot more at 
stake, as the Black woman, than 
Richard does as a white man, 
it’s a small interaction, never 
addressed again. There was 
more focus on a racist cop telling 
Loving that he was going to get in 
trouble for sleeping with a Black 
woman than there was on how 
the dangers of this relationship 

were affecting Mildred.

The film hints at the fact that 

the white lawyers are excited 
about this case because it’ll 
be an important win for their 
careers — but it then goes on to 
portray them as men who only 
wanted to do the right thing. 
And even though the scenes in 
the courtrooms are much shorter 
than in other movies with court 
cases surrounding issues of race 
— “Amistad,” “Lincoln,” and 
“To Kill a Mockingbird” are the 
first few to come to mind, all of 
which are also framed through 
the white male hero lens — the 
lawyers are still positioned as 
heroic.

The music score picks up 

when the two lawyers start 
working on the case, and swells 
triumphantly when they are 
in the courtroom. The private 
side conversation between them 
about how they know their 
plan to get the Lovings arrested 
again puts the family in danger 
and they’re not completely sure 
they’ll be able to get them out 
of it unscathed is not framed 
as a serious discussion about 
the potential benefits of doing 
something risky for the greater 
good, but rather as a funny aside 
from one to the other as they 
smile and wave goodbye at the 
Lovings’ retreating figures. That 
scene was not a moment of comic 
relief from the upcoming tension, 
as it was probably intended to be, 
but jarring.

I think there’s often a tendency, 

in coverage of American period 
films 
that 
revolve 
around 

conflicts 
we 
like 
to 
pride 

ourselves on having conquered, 
to praise them more than we 
would otherwise, because no 
one wants to have their criticsm 
interpreted as a sign that they 
aren’t aligned with the messages 
of hope and triumph within the 
movies. There is a tendency to 
exalt them because if we can say 
that a movie portrays something 
like the battle for civil rights 
accurately and beautifully, then 
that means we have 360 degrees 
of perspective around it.

But now is not the time to only 

bask in the beauty of a period film 
that makes us feel good about 
how far we’ve come. Rather, we 
should be pushing ourselves 
and each other further than 
ever before in artwork that has 
a social message, understanding 
that no story like this will ever be 
perfectly told. We would only be 
doing ourselves a disservice by 
not allowing films that deal with 
important subject matter to be 
analyzed in every way that other 
pieces are.

GENDER & MEDIA COLUMN

NETFLIX

Mystery, Inc. has not aged well.

There’s something to be said 

for the willingness to produce 
a 
blatant 
rip-off. 
“Pacific 

Heat” 
is 
not 

good, of course, 
but I can’t help 
but applaud the 
sheer brazenness 
of an animated 
TV 
show 
that 

is, 
essentially, 

an 
Australian 

version of “Archer.”

Created 
by 
and 
starring 

Australian comedy team Rob 
Sitch (“Utopia”), Santo Cilauro 
(“Frontline”) and Tom Gleisner 
(“Have 
You 
Been 
Paying 

Attention?”), 
“Pacific 
Heat” 

looks, feels and plays like a low-
rent version of FX’s animated 
series. The show centers around 
an undercover intelligence unit, 
whose nickname the title bears, 
as they infiltrate, operate and 
decapitate crime on Australia’s 
Gold Coast. There’s a square-
jawed, somewhat incompetent 
lead, a domineering boss and 
wearily sarcastic female agents.

That 
sounds, 
of 
course, 

dispiritingly 
familiar. 
And 

if 
there’s 
some 
Australian 

comedic 
sensibility 
to 
be 

perceived — like the milieu 
that produced hidden gems 
“Summer Heights High” and 
“Ja’mie: Private School Girl” — 
then it’s difficult to distinguish 
it from even the jokes the show 
explicitly lifts from “Archer,” 

like the female 
characters 
that 

always seem to 
end up in their 
underwear 
on 

missions.

But 
the 

underlying issue 
is this: what is 

the point of diluted satire? If 
“Archer” itself is a send-up of 
“James Bond” and its tropes, 
then 
“Pacific 
Heat” 
needs 

something more to add to the 
subversion. The critiques of the 
form that “Archer” makes are 
pointed and deliberate, and so 
“Pacific Heat,” by its existence, 
must join the conversation. 
From all available signs, it 
doesn’t. 

The 
jokes 
are 
mostly 

obvious, as is characteristic of 
the average comedy pilot. The 
comedic template the show 
establishes is not inviting or 
warm, but rather too eager 
to traffic in uncomfortably 
stereotypical Asian jokes and 
exaggerated 
accents. 
The 

characters are thinly sketched 

(literally) and unconvincing. 
Prickly, in-your-face comedy is 
possible and necessary, but so is 
audience empathy.

Moreover, “Pacific Heat”’s 

animation 
is 
disquietingly 

odd. The basic template is, 
once again, the stilted and 
halting motion of “Archer,” but 
there’s 
something 
different 

here, whether it’s the strangely 
colored 
eyes 
or 
the 
hair 

shading that seems a bit off. 
And while shows like “BoJack 
Horseman” couple this kind 
of stiff animation with the 
bored, deep-throated delivery 
to create deadpan perfection, 
“Pacific Heat” seems beset by 
the irritating urge to have its 
characters talk over each other 
instead, a comedic trope that 
becomes well-worn before the 
pilot is even finished.

Mostly 
though, 
“Pacific 

Heat” reads as inessential. 
It’s a copy, but a worse one. 
A satire, but weaker. A show 
that, by all accounts, isn’t 
worth 
an 
investment. 
An 

Australian 
production 
team 

and an Australian setting can’t 
differentiate the show enough 
from its obvious influence, and 
in this modern context of TV 
as the wellspring of original, 
influential 
media, 
that’s 

difficult to reconcile.

Michigan picking up the pieces

The Michigan hockey team 

was outscored, 11-2, in its two-
game series at Penn State. 
There aren’t many positives the 
Wolverines can take away from 
those results, and in the press 
conference after Friday’s game, 
that sentiment was reinforced.

When 
talking 
about 
the 

physical nature of the series, 
Michigan coach Red Berenson 
said his team still had pride, and 
senior forward Alex Kile quietly 
explained that Michigan simply 
wasn’t good enough against the 
Nittany Lions.

Yet, the season still goes on. 

As devastated as the Wolverines 
(0-2-0 Big Ten, 6-7-1 overall) may 
have been after the weekend, 
Wisconsin will still travel to 
Ann Arbor for the teams’ series 
starting Friday. Despite how 
poorly Michigan played against 
Penn State, it still must find a 
way to refocus for the future.

“We had a good meeting 

before 
practice,” 
Berenson 

said. “We talked about having 
a rebound week, and get back 
to playing the kind of hockey 
we were playing two or three 
weeks ago.”

Shifting focus may be easier 

for Berenson than others — he’s 
spent most of his life playing 
and coaching hockey. For the 
players themselves, refocusing 
after a blowout loss can be more 
difficult, but veteran players can 
smooth the transition from a 
poor showing to the next game.

“First 
of 
all, 
I 
spend 

personally — and I encourage 
other guys to do this — 20 
minutes after any game, good or 
bad, thinking about that game,” 
said senior goaltender Zach 
Nagelvoort. “And then it’s all on 
to the next thing. And I think 

you’d find a lot of other guys in 
the locker room who have that 
same approach. So as far as the 
week of practice, we’re looking 
forward. 
We’re 
looking 
at 

Wisconsin 
this 

weekend.”

Nagelvoort 

played 
in 

Thursday’s 
game 
against 

the 
Nittany 

Lions and faced 
29 shots in just 
two 
periods, 

one 
more 

shot 
than 
the 

Wolverines had 
the entire game. 
As staggering as that total is, 
it pales in comparison to the 
58 shots from Penn State that 
freshman Jack LaFontaine faced 
Friday.

Nevertheless, the number of 

shots a goaltender faces is not 
in his control. And just like how 
Michigan must refocus on the 
next game, Nagelvoort says, a 

goaltender 
has 

to refocus on the 
next shot.

“You 
can’t 

make the save 
seven 
shots 

from now right 
now,” Nagelvoort 
said. 
“Staying 

in the moment 
is 
the 
biggest 

thing, 
which 

is 
one 
of 
the 

hardest 
things 

to do in goaltending, and in any 
sport I would imagine, and a lot 
of different things in life. But 
specifically as a goalie, you’ve got 
to just find some way to stay dialed 

in to the moment you’re in.”

Giving up a high volume of 

shots is just one of Michigan’s 
weaknesses that Penn State 
exposed. The team is working 
to 
fix 
those 
weaknesses, 

and Berenson isn’t going to 
overreact. He is focused on 
improving the team that he has 
right now.

“It’s not any one thing,” 

Berenson said. “Our penalty 
killing wasn’t very good. Our 
power play wasn’t very good, 
our goalies were, I thought, OK. 
Our defense has to be better, and 
our forwards have to be better.

“It’s a challenge. And yet, 

we’re not going to reinvent our 
team. We’re not going to trade 
all our players. We’re going to 
try and build them up and get 
them playing the way they need 
to play.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Offensive woes plague 
Wolverines in defeat

When the Michigan women’s 

basketball team hosted Xavier 
last season, it ran the Musketeers 
out of Crisler Center to the tune 
of a 92-54 
beatdown.

But 

when it was 
the Wolverines’ turn to travel 
from Ann Arbor to Cincinnati, 
Xavier (6-0) made last season’s 
loss a distant memory, edging 
Michigan, 61-58.

Unlike last year’s offensive 

blitzkrieg, the Wolverines (7-2) 
uncharacteristically struggled 
to sink their shots, shooting 
just 33.9 percent from the field.

Michigan’s 
offensive 

troubles also hurt them in 
the paint. Two early fouls 
by sophomore center Hallie 
Thome 
sidelined 
her 
for 

much of the first half, and the 
Wolverines couldn’t develop a 
low post presence throughout 
the game.

The two teams were mostly 

similar on the stat sheet, but 
the Musketeers held a big 
rebounding advantage on both 
ends. With Thome in foul 
trouble and a smaller lineup in 
to replace her, Xavier pounded 
the 
glass, 
outrebounding 

Michigan 46-32 and getting 
the second chances it needed, 
which 
proved 
to 
be 
the 

difference maker.

While 
the 
Wolverines’ 

issues in those areas kept the 
contest closer than expected, 
their defense also stymied the 
Musketeers’ attack, forcing a 
28-28 tie heading into halftime.

Just as Michigan did against 

Western Michigan on Nov. 21, 
when it had a two-point lead 
at halftime but pulled away in 
the second half, the Wolverines 

hoped they could replicate that 
same performance into the 
third quarter.

“I definitely did expect (the 

team) to start clicking,” said 
Michigan coach Kim Barnes 
Arico. “I think we showed signs 
of it. But we really couldn’t 
sustain it. Xavier did a great 
job of taking us out of our game 
plan, limiting our transition, 
and we started to play in the 
half-court, which we don’t 
want to do.”

Offensive 
difficulties 
for 

both teams carried into the 
second half, but the Wolverines 
entered the final quarter with a 
46-44 lead thanks to a buzzer-
beating bucket by freshman 
guard Kysre Gondrezick.

But for Michigan, the worst 

shooting woes were yet to 
come. After a five-point run 
by Xavier, layups from senior 
guard Siera Thompson and 
junior guard Katelynn Flaherty 
put the Wolverines down only 
one with 3:08 left in the game.

From 
that 
point 
on, 

Michigan made just three free 
throws and missed its final six 
field-goal attempts, unable to 
take the lead and the game.

“I was trying to get us going 

offensively, but I think it cost 
us on the defensive end,” 
Barnes Arico said. “We really 
did get killed on the glass 
and didn’t have any second-
chance opportunities. We went 
offensive to get something 
going, and it hurt us with our 
rebounding.”

In 
Michigan’s 
worst 

offensive 
outing 
thus 
far, 

Flaherty and Thompson were 
the 
only 
Wolverines 
who 

notched double figures, scoring 
21 and 12, respectively — a stark 
contrast from a team that came 
into the game seventh in the 
nation in scoring offense.

MEN’S SWIMMING
Michigan finishes sixth 
at Georgia Invitational

Traveling to Georgia for 

the UGA Fall Invitational, the 
Michigan 
men’s 
swimming 

and diving team managed to 
earn 503 points on Sunday, 
finishing sixth among seven 
teams 
and 
placing 
seven 

swimmers in the top-eight in 
the invitational finals.

Michigan opened up Friday 

with 12 NCAA provisional ‘B’ 
times and two 
NCAA 
Diving 

scores. 
The 

team added to 
their ‘B’ times 
with 17 more on 
Saturday 
and 

finished 
the 

invitational on 
Sunday with an 
additional 
11, 

bringing 
their 

weekend 
total 

to 40.

The 
team 
missed 
some 

key 
pieces 
during 
the 

weekend, with juniors Paul 
Powers, PJ Ransford, Evan 
White, 
sophomore 
Mokhtar 

Al-Yamani, 
and 
freshman 

Felix Auböck all sitting out 
the competition to participate 
in the FINA World Swimming 
Championships 
that 
begin 

Tuesday in Windsor, Ontario.

Leading the way for the 

Wolverines were a quintet of 
freshmen in Charlie Swanson, 
Miles 
Smachlo, 
Jacob 

Montague, Steven Anderson, 
and Jake Herremans, all five 
of whom qualified for their 
events’ finals on Saturday and 
Sunday.

Swanson, a Big Ten Freshman 

of the Week, followed up a 400-
yard IM championship in the 
USA College Challenge with a 
fifth-place finish (3:46.06) in 
the same event on Saturday and 

a 13th-place finish in the 200-
yard breaststroke, clocking a 
time of 1:58.88.

Ranked fourth in the Big Ten 

in both the 100-yard and 200-
yard breaststroke, Montague 
took seventh in the 100 on 
Saturday with a 53.51 finish 
and outpaced Swanson in the 
200 with a time of 1:57.30, 
placing him eighth in the final 
on Sunday.

Anderson came away with 

a 10th-place finish in the 

three-meter 
springboard 
final 
on 

Saturday with a 
score of 295.10 
and earned fifth 
in the platform 
final on Sunday 
(291.95).

Herremans 

played 
an 

active role the 
entire weekend, 

receiving 
an 
NCAA 
Zone 

Diving qualifying score on 
Friday with a 309.75 mark in the 
one-meter springboard final 
on Friday, earning him sixth 
place. He followed the strong 
start with a score of 281.70 in 
the three-meter springboard 
final on Saturday and a tally 
of 262.35 in the platform final 
on Sunday, placing 12th and 
eighth, respectively.

Smachlo 
finished 
fourth 

in the 100-yard butterfly on 
Saturday (46.88) and 10th in 
the finals for the 200-yard 
butterfly with a 1:45.09 mark 
on Sunday.

The Wolverines will now 

enjoy 
a 
month-long 
break

with 40 NCAA 
‘B’ qualifiers.

Michigan placed fourth out of eight teams at the Georgia Invitational over the weekend and will next compete in the Orange Bowl Classic on Jan. 3.

Ryan, Bi lead Wolverines in fourth-place finish

The No. 4 Michigan women’s 

swimming and diving teams 
went head to head with some 
of the nation’s top competition 
and came out feeling positive 
about its results.

For a team that was ranked 

No. 1 in the country at the 
beginning of the season, a 
middling fourth-place finish 
out of eight teams might seem 
like a disappointment.

But 
at 
the 
Georgia 

Invitational in Athens, Ga., 
the Wolverines broke several 
school and conference records 
— a good sign for a team that is 
aiming to add to its a Big Ten 
championship season from last 
year — and were able to qualify 
swimmers for seven races at the 
NCAA “A” level, and 33 races at 
the NCAA “B” level.

Five teams ranked in the top 

11 competed at the meet, with 
No. 10 California coming out 
on top.

Junior 
G 
Ryan 
and 

sophomore Yirong Bi were the 
long-distance standouts from 
Michigan. In the first day of 
action, Ryan swam her best race 
of the season, posting a Big Ten 
record time of 4:34.28 in the 
500-yard freestyle.

It is Ryan’s favorite event 

to swim, and she normally 
competes well in the race. But 
the record finish time was a 
surprise, even to her.

“It kind of came out of 

nowhere,” Ryan said. “It was 
a lot of attention to detail and 
consistency in training that 
really helped that race be what 
it was.”

Bi was not far behind, joining 

Ryan in posting a time good 
enough to qualify for the NCAA 
“A” championships. The pair 
now ranks No. 3 and No. 4 in the 
event nationally, trailing only 
U.S. Olympians Katie Ledecky 
(Stanford) and Leah Smith 
(Virginia Tech).

In the 1,650-yard freestyle, 

Bi and Ryan placed 1-2 again 

— and this time Bi took the 
victory. She made the “A” cut 
for the event, while Ryan — a 
few seconds behind — qualified 
for the “B” level.

Bi and Ryan also teamed up 

in the 4x200-yard freestyle 
relay to post a sub-7:00 time, 
finishing second in the event 
and earning another NCAA 
“A” status. They were aided 
by junior Gabby DeLoof and 
sophomore Siobhán Haughey 
— who also won the individual 
event to bring home Michigan’s 
only race victory in Saturday’s 
action.

“The energy — especially 

on the relays — feeding off of 
each other and supporting each 
other … that was the best part 
(of the weekend).”

Another 
“A” 
level 

performance came in the 400-
yard freestyle relay on Sunday, 
with the Wolverines clocking 
in at 3:13.65. But that was only 
good for third place in the race, 
on a day that showed just how 
tough the competition at the 

meet really was.

Haughey — the 2016 Big 

Ten champion in the 100-yard 
freestyle — swam well enough 
to qualify for the NCAA “A” 
meet in the event, with a time 
of 48.31 within six tenths of 
her personal record. Still, she 
finished just sixth in the race. 

Similarly, 
freshman 

Vanessa 
Kraus 
broke 
the 

Michigan school record in the 
200-butterfly, but finished fifth 
overall in the event finals.

Spending the weekend side 

by side with some of the nation’s 
top teams, the Wolverines know 
they can compete with the 
best down the line. What’s in 
store for the end of the season? 
Ryan doesn’t want to predict 
anything, but the team is feeling 
good about its chances.

“It’s hard to predict the 

future,” Ryan said. “But what 
I see now is that we’re going 
to continue to work hard, 
continue to grow as a team, 
(and) put everything out there 
when we swim.”

GRANT HARDY/Daily

Redshirt sophomore quarterback Wilton Speight threw for 2,375 passing yards and 17 touchdowns in the regular season, his first as a starter for Michigan.
Season in Review: Quarterbacks

With the Michigan football 

team’s 2016 regular season in the 
books, the Daily looks back at the 
performance of each unit this year 
and looks ahead to the future in 
2017. In this edition: quarterbacks.

With 
2015 
starting 

quarterback 
Jake 
Rudock 

departing after an impressive 
single-season 
leap 
from 

unproven graduate transfer to 
NFL Draft pick, the Michigan 
football 
team 
had 
a 
huge 

question mark at quarterback at 
the beginning of 2016.

It turned out that question 

was all but answered in the 
spring, and that answer might 
be the key to the Wolverines’ 
offense for the next two seasons.

The year started with an 

open 
competition 
between 

redshirt 
sophomore 
Wilton 

Speight and redshirt juniors 
John O’Korn and Shane Morris, 
but Speight emerged as the 
frontrunner for the starting 
job before the Spring Game in 
April. He never relinquished 
his lead, and he embarked on a 
remarkable first starting season 
that, in many ways, mirrored 
his predecessor’s.

Despite 
throwing 
an 

interception on his first pass 
this season, Speight came back 
to throw seven touchdowns 
in his first two games, tying a 
school record to start a season.

He overcame an elbow injury 

to beat eventual Pac-12 runner-
up Colorado, put up 49 points 
in a win over eventual Big 
Ten champion Penn State and 
uncorked a 45-yard touchdown 
to 
fifth-year 
senior 
wide 

receiver Amara Darboh to seal 
the deal against eventual Big 
Ten West champion Wisconsin. 
And that wasn’t even his best 
three-game 
stretch 
of 
the 

season (more on that later).

If it wasn’t abundantly clear 

that 
Speight 
deserved 
the 

starting job early on, a late-
season shoulder injury proved 
it. Speight missed the Indiana 
game on Nov. 19 after sustaining 
an injury late in Michigan’s loss 
to Iowa, and O’Korn turned in a 
season-low 56 passing yards in 
his place despite still picking up 
the win.

Of course, Speight returned 

for the Wolverines’ thrilling 
regular-season finale against 
Ohio State, throwing for two 
touchdowns and leaving his 
team just three points shy 
of a chance at the Big Ten 
Championship.

The 
first-time 
starter 

finished 
the 
year 
with 

2,375 
passing 
yards 
and 

17 
touchdowns 
against 
six 

interceptions. 
He 
not 
only 

answered one of Michigan’s 
more 
pressing 
preseason 

questions, but he established 
himself as a potential face of the 
offense for years to come.

HIGH POINT: Over one 

stretch starting in late October, 

Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
said in three straight postgame 
press conferences that Speight 
had just completed his best 
game yet. During that run — 
which included wins against 
Illinois, Michigan State and 
Maryland — Speight completed 
70.8 percent of his passes for 
859 yards and four touchdowns, 
with his passer rating reaching 
levels of well over 200 during 
the games.

To cap it off, Speight added 

his 
first 
career 
rushing 

touchdown against Maryland, 
leaping over the goal line after 
a 10-yard scramble — an image 
now 
immortalized 
on 
his 

Twitter account as a parody of 
the Jordan Brand’s Jumpman 
logo. It was the icing on the cake 
for a quarterback not known for 
his running ability. (As fifth-
year senior defensive end Chris 
Wormley once quipped, “You 
see Wilton try and scramble 
and it looks like it hurts.”)

LOW POINT: One could 

argue 
that 
Speight’s 
two 

interceptions and the fumble on 
the one-yard line against Ohio 
State were his three biggest 
mistakes of the season, but his 
command of the offense still 
put the Wolverines in position 
to win that game. His true low 
point came two weeks earlier 
in Iowa City, when Michigan 
mustered just one offensive 
touchdown in a 14-13 upset loss 
to the Hawkeyes.

Speight completed 11 of 26 

passes for just 103 yards, finishing 
with a season-worst 67.9 passer 
rating, zero touchdowns and 
an interception. His inability to 
keep the offense on the field late 
in the game proved fatal, as the 
Wolverines went three and out 
despite needing to kill less than 
two minutes of game time in 
the fourth quarter. A face-mask 
penalty on the ensuing punt set up 
Iowa’s game-winning field goal.

THE FUTURE: Harbaugh 

does 
love 
his 
quarterback 

competitions 
— 
and 
he’ll 

have plenty of capable bodies 
next season — but Speight’s 
performance this season likely 
cemented his place as the 
starter going forward.

O’Korn and Morris each have 

a year of eligibility remaining, 
but Harbaugh has said that fifth 
years aren’t guaranteed, and 
if this year is any indication, 
playing time should be hard to 
come by for the two veterans.

The more intriguing name, 

however, is Brandon Peters — a 
soon-to-be 
redshirt 
freshman 

who has enough talent to be 
touted by some as Harbaugh’s 
next Andrew Luck. And highly 
coveted 
2017 
recruit 
Dylan 

McCaffrey will be on campus 
next fall as well, making for a 
gifted and crowded quarterback 
room no matter who the starter is.

It seems likely that Speight 

will hang onto his job, but 
Michigan’s 
quarterback 

storyline will surely be heavily 
scrutinized for years to come.

Wolverines ready for 
up-tempo Longhorns

A week ago, the Michigan 

men’s basketball team squared 
off against a Virginia Tech 
squad 
that 

head 
coach 

John 
Beilein 

said 
would 

“push 
(the 

ball) up the 
floor 
right 

down 
our 

throat.”

The 

Wolverines 
(6-2) held serve 
for most of the 
game 
against 

the up-tempo 
Hokies, but ultimately faltered 
down the stretch, losing in 
overtime, 73-70.

Michigan will get another 

chance to face an up-tempo 
team at home against Texas 
(4-3) on Tuesday night, in the 
front end of a home-and-home 
series that matches the teams 
up again next year in Austin, 
Texas.

The two teams also met last 

season in the Bahamas at the 
Battle 4 Atlantis, where the 
Wolverines 
were victorious, 
76-72.

Coached 
by 

Shaka 
Smart, 

the Longhorns 
push the pace 
of the game not 
through 
their 

offense, 
but 

their 
defense, 

a strategy that 
led to much of 
Smart’s success 
at 
Virginia 

Commonwealth 
before 
he 

moved to Texas.

“Shaka has more than he 

had last year, when we played 
them, of the havoc full-court 
defense,” Beilein said. “They’re 
playing some zones, and they 
have a lot of good action going 
on, and our players will have to 
play well.”

Because of Texas’ up-tempo 

defense, the Wolverines will 
have to work harder and rely 
on bench players, especially 
freshman 
guard 
Xavier 

Simpson, who will have to give 
senior guard Derrick Walton 
Jr. a break.

“We’re 
going 
to 
need 

(Simpson) to help Derrick,” 
Beilein said. “Not only to 
beat the press or attack their 
defense, 
but 
also 
to 
give 

(Walton) a rest.”

Added Simpson: “I feel like I 

can handle it. I’m being worked 
on every day in practice and 
getting better and just learning 

the pace of the game.”

But besides the fact that 

Michigan is about to face a 
high-energy 
team, 
Tuesday 

night’s bout will also be the 
Wolverines’ 
third 
game 
in 

seven days.

“(It’s) something we see a lot 

of in the Big Ten, so it’s been 
good for us to go through that 
type of schedule this week,” 
Beilein said.

Most 
recently, 
Michigan 

is coming off an 82-55 win 
over Kennesaw State that saw 
sophomore 
forward 
Moritz 

Wagner score a career-high 20 
points and redshirt sophomore 
DJ Wilson grab his second 
career double-double with 15 
points and 11 rebounds.

The duo, though, will have 

a much tougher time trying 
to repeat their feats against 
Texas.

Inside, the Longhorns start 

6-foot-11 forward Jarrett Allen 
at the ‘5’ and athletic forward 
Shaquille Cleare at the ‘4.’ 
Both will provide challenges 
for Wagner and Wilson at both 
ends of the court.

“They’re a great post-up 

team,” Beilein said. “They’re 
going to play out of the post like 

crazy, so post 
defense has to 
be important.”

Texas 
also 

features guard 
Tevin 
Mack, 

who leads the 
Longhorns 
in 

scoring 
with 

14 points per 
game 
despite 

starting in only 
one game this 
season thus far.

But 
while 

Michigan 
understands 
that 

Texas will bring something 
different to the table, the 
Wolverines still want to play 
their own game, which is 
something they haven’t been 
able to do in their two losses 
this season.

“We just want to stick to 

our style of play,” said senior 
forward Zak Irvin. “We like 
to get up and down, too. 
We don’t want to do things 
uncharacteristically. 
The 

turnovers we had, we want to 
limit those.”

Michigan is looking to build 

on its momentum from its win 
over Kennesaw State. Another 
win over a Texas team that has 
bounced in and out of the top 
25, would be a nice springboard 
before the Wolverines play at 
No. 2 UCLA on Saturday.

But 
right 
now, 
the 

Wolverines 
aren’t 
looking 

ahead. They have to take care 
of business on Tuesday first.
