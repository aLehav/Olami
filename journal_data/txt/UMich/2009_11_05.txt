CAMPUS PSYCHOLOGICAL SCRVICES
CAPS takes
on concerns

LIGHTS. CAMERA. THE CUBE

Renovations, additional
counselors and new
database part of effort to
solve students' criticisms
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
For many students, the Counseling and
Psychological Services center has been a
go-to resource for assistance with issues
they're facing on campus, but for some it
has been more of a source of stress than
relief.
Many students have raised concerns
about the long waiting time for a sched-
uled appointment, long entrance assess-
ments - or informational forms - and
talk of only being able to meet with a spe-
cific counselor three times.
CAPS officials said they are aware of
these concerns and misconceptions and
are working toward improving them by
renovating the center, hiring more coun-
selors and creating a new database of
community providers.

Todd Sevig, CAPS's director, saidCAPS
is taking on a new approach to helping
student mental health issues by thinking
in a more campus-wide and community
connection mindset.
"No one entity on campus is going to
be able at any one moment to address
every need for every student in the year,"
he said. "So the new database will really
help in that regard."
The community providers database,
which is expected to go live on Monday,
will allow students to look up a provider
that fits their needs, has current open-
ings, takes their insurance and is within
walking distance.
"It's a little different than a typical
database or obviously looking in a phone
book," Sevig said. "It's all geared toward
student life."
As part of the renovation, four new
offices in the center are expected to be
completed by the end of the week and
appointments there are scheduled for as
early as next week.
Sevigsaid the increased space and staff
to fill the rooms is the "most concrete
way" the center is addressing the student

* At Heidelberg, anteing
up for local charities

Bar has permits from
the state to host charity
poker tournaments
By ELYANA TWIGGS
Daily StaffReporter
For many nonprofit organizations, the
economic downturn has stifled fundrais-
ing efforts. However, a local bar is stack-
ing the deck to encourage University
students and area residents to give back.
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednes-
day nights mean charity poker at The
Heidelberg - a German bar and restau-
rant on Main Street. The smoky upstairs
bar converts into a miniature casino,
complete with five poker tables, two cash
tables and a blackjack table. And though
the house always wins at most casinos,

at The Heidelberg, charities are the true
winners, the program's coordinators say.
One week last month, 50 percent of the
entrance fees went to benefit Disabled
American Veterans. Every week, a differ-
ent nonprofit organization benefits, and
the poker room is booked with charity
events until March of next year.
Volunteer Jim Altman calls these char-
ity poker nights "millionaire parties."
"The reason (the poker nights) have
gotten more popular is because with the
economythe way it is, less and less people
are willing to give a nice share of money
to charities," Altman said. "It is an excel-
lent way for charities to make money for
their.group."
With attendees including everyone
from Ann Arbor residents to Law School
students, the charity poker room can
raise anywhere from $50 to $10,000 for a

University alum
now calls the shots
at Washington
law firm
By JILLIAN BERMAN
Daily NewsEditor
WASHINGTON D:C. -
Though she's sitting in a
cool, crisp conference room,
perched high above the sultry
concrete jungle of downtown
Washington D.C., University
alum Laurie Miller is very
much in the thick of things.
As chair of powerful law
firm Nixon Peabody's gov-
ernment investigations and
white-collar defense practice,
Miller is charged with defend-
ing some of the nation's most
powerful and influential fig-
ures. Her clients have included
multiple Congressmen, presi-
dents of Fortune 500 compa-
nies and officials in both Bush
administrations and the Clin-
ton administration. But Miller
isn't much of a namedropper.

"I can tell if I've done a good
job if nobody ever knows that
my client is under investiga-
tion," she said in an interview
in late August.
When she's not writing
briefs or defending her clients'
good name in the courtroom,
Miller finds other ways to
get involved in the Washing-
ton scene. As co-chair of the
National Women's Forum for
Obama, she held one of the
first fundraisers for the then-
senator from Illinois.
And after becoming presi-
dent, Obama didn't forget
Miller. She was there when he
announced his nomination of
Justice Sonia Sotomayor to the
Supreme Court.
Though Miller has been in
Washington for more than
30 years, she wasn't always a
power broker. In fact, her rise
to the top began with a letter
to another University alum
that she penned when she was
a junior majoring in political
science and French at the Uni-

versity.
"My Congressman at the
time was the House (of Rep-
resentatives) Minority Leader
named Gerald R. Ford," she
said, reclining in a board room
chair and sipping a can of Diet
Coke. "And I wrote a letter
asking for an internship."
A few months later, Miller
moved to Washington for the
summer.
"I got hooked on it," she
said. "Washington was every-
thing I had been hearing about
and studying about in Ann
Arbor."
When she got back to the
University in the fall, Mill-
er continued to pursue her
degrees and soon thereafter
found out that her former boss
was going to become a much
larger player in American poli-
tics.
Carolyn Burgess, Miller's
roommate at the Delta, Delta
Delta sorority house, remem-
bers sitting around the tele-
vision with other girls in the
house on an October night
in 1973, when Spiro Agnew
resigned from his post as vice

president.
As the history goes, Ford
replaced Agnew.
"My recollection was that
(Miller) had had (Ford) write
her reference letters. We all
said 'Oh my gosh, she's got
the U.S. vice president writ-
ingherreference letters," Bur-
gess said. "Typical Laurie just
being herself, she had these
amazing people that thought
well of her."
But Burgess added that she
wouldn't have expected any-
thing less of Miller, who spent
many of her nights staying
up late in the Undergraduate
Library.
"I've got some really stupid
pictures of us horsing around
the sorority house and she's
not in some of them because
she was a more serious stu-
dent," Burgess said. "But she
was never holier than thou
about it. She just did what she
did."
Burgess said she can often
remember Miller coming in to
the sorority house with stacks
of books in her hands and her

SOCIAL SAFETY
Makeup magic: Lip gloss product
tests drinks for date rape drugs

British product
conceals test strip
in makeup handle
By LINDSAY KRAMER
Daily StaffReporter
Students entering college are
often warned about the dangers of
putting their drinks down at par-
ties. But thanks to a new product,
there's more they can do to protect
themselves from date rape drugs.
2LoveMyLips recently devel-
oped a lip gloss that comes with
a small, portable kit that can be
used to test a drink to see if it was
spiked with drugs. The kit includes
a pink taper slip that, when placed
into a drink, will turn blue if the
drink contains traces of GHB or

ketamine - common date rape
drugs.
The product was first launched
in the United Kingdom and has
showed positive sales in beauty
salons across the country. The
company plans not only to bring
the gloss overseas, but also to
make it available at bars and in
restrooms so it is accessible if
someone is concerned that their
drink has been tainted.
Although the company's owner
Tracy Whittaker said she expect-
ed sales to focus on women ages
17-35, the product has been sold to
men as well as women of all ages.
She said men have been buyingthe
product for their wives, daughters
and girlfriends.
Whittaker is looking to bring
her product overseas as soon as
possible and is seeking a distribu-

tor. The largest portion of online
sales has come from the United
States.
"We would love to get it onto
the college campuses," Whittaker
said, "because that's where there
is a lot of (drink) spiking."
Aimee Nimeh, Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness Center
assistant director for education
and training at the University, said
she isn't sure how effective the
product would be at the Univer-
sity, especially considering it only
tests for GHB and ketamine.
She added that date rape drugs
are not as prevalent on campus in
date rape cases.
"We don't see very many cases
of the date rape drug being used,"
she said. "Alcohol on its own is
more widely used."

A GANG OF SINGERS

A war-time call for educators

Few students are strang-
era to shouts blaring in the
Diag, belonging to groups
clamoring for attention from
passersby. Theoe organiza-
tions often call for participa-
tion in campus clubs or ask
students rushing to class for
charitable donations.
But in 1943, one organiza-
tion called in a favor with a
much greater intensity.
The Willow Run Com-
munity School - home to a
high school, adult education
classes and a day care center
- reached out to University
co-eds to fill the void of edu-
cators lost to people helping
with the World War II effort.
According to an article in
The Michigan Daily on Dec.
15, 1943, attendance at Wil-
low Run increased from 180

children to 410 as more par-
tots became employed in
war-related work - and with
that boom in attendance,
more teachers were needed.
Though government offi-
cials had already built three
new schools to try to com-
pensate for the expanded
enrollment, the program at
Willow Run needed women
at the University to keep the
program afloat, according to
the article.
The school especially
called for women with any
experience in caring for sick
children, emphasizing the
desperation of the situation.
"Expansion of the Child-
care Program at Willow
Run depends on University
women," the article stated.
"They are needed to super-

vise the activities of these
children."
According to the article,
a major cause of absentee-
ism at the time was the fact
that parents had to choose
between showing up at their
jobs - which could help the
war effort - and caring for
their children.
Due to this lack of ade-
quate childcare, the adult
education program at Wil-
low Run was also suffering
great losses, according to the
article.
Registration to help vol-
unteer at the Willow Run
School was held in the Mieh-
ipso League lobby, where
student volunteers stood and
answered questions about
the program.

NEWS BRIEFS
EAST LANSING
Michigan State
freshman charged
for building bomb
Four 18-year-old freshmen at
Michigan State University have
been charged after a three-inch
mortar exploded in an East Lan-
sing yard.
Campus police spokeswoman
Florene McGlothian-Taylor tells
the Detroit Free Press for a story
yesterday that the device was
powerful enough to kill some-
one.
The mortar was detonated Sun-
day. Two additional devises were.
found in a car after the students
were arrested.
Olivia Hudson, Sasha Sav-
age, Darby Dudley and Nikolai
Wasielewski are charged with
placing explosives and causing
property damage. They also are
charged with possession of bombs
with unlawful intent to cause
property damage.
The students were released
Monday following a hearing in
East Lansing District Court.
MEXICO CITY
Hospital workers
arrested for selling
newborn babies
Three doctors and a nurse
have been arrested for allegedly
* selling newborns after telling
mothers their babies had died at
a private hospital in Mexico City,
authorities said yesterday.
Police uncovered the scheme
after one of the women learned
her baby was alive and had been
sold to another woman for 15,000
pesos ($1,130), said Luis Genaro,
the capital's deputy attorney
general.
The woman gave birth to a
girl through cesarean section at
the Central West Hospital in a
working-class district in October
2008, Genaro said at a news con-
ference.
He said she told authorities she
heard her baby cry but when she
asked to see the child, doctors
told her she had to wait until the
effects of the anesthetics wore
off. Later, doctors told her the
bsby-had-beery-taken to-amother
hospital. A day later, the woman
was told her baby died and had
been cremated, Genaro said.
NEW HAVEN, Conn.
Woman sues after
mauling by chimp
The family of a Connecticut
woman mauled and blinded by a
chimpanzee sought yesterday to
sue the state for $150 million, say-
ing officials failed to prevent the
attack.
Attorneys for Charla Nash's
family filed a notice Wednesday
with the state Office of Claims
Commissioner asking for permis-
sion to sue.
The 200-pound chimpanzee
named Travis went berserk in
February when his owner, San-

dra Herold, asked Nash to help
lure him back into her house in
Stamford.
The animal ripped off Nash's
hands, nose, lips and eyelids; she
remains in stable condition at the
Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.
A Department of Environmen-
tal Protection biologist warned
state officials before the attack
that Travis could seriously hurt
someone if he felt threatened,
noting that he was large and
strong.

Italy convicts CIA in rendition case

23 Americans
convicted for
Egyptian terror
suspect kidnapping
MILAN (AP) - An Italian judge
found 23 Americans and two Ital-
ians guilty yesterday in the kidnap-
ping of an Egyptian terror suspect,
deliveringthe firstlegal convictions
anywhere in the world against peo-
ple involved in the CIA's extraordi-
nary renditions program.
Human rights groups hailed
the decision and pressed Presi-
dent Barack Obama to repudiate
the Bush administration's practice
of abducting terror suspects and
transferring them to third coun-
tries where torture was permitted.
TheAmerican Civil Liberties Union
said the verdicts were the first con-
victions stemming from the rendi-
tion program.
The Obama administration
ended the CIA's interrogation pro-
gram and shuttered its secret over-
seas jails in January but has opted
to continue the practice of extraor-
dinary reetditions.
The Americans, who were tried
in absentia, now cannot travel to
Europe without risking arrest as

long as the verdicts remains in
place.
One of those convicted, former
Milan consular official Sabrina De
Sousa, accused Congress oftturning
a blind eye to the entire matter.
"No one has investigated the fact
that the U.S. government allegedly
conducted a rendition of an indi-
vidual who now walks free and the
operation of which was so bungled,"
she said, speakingthrough her law-
yer Mark Zaid.
Despite the convictions cap-
ping the nearly three-year Italian
trial, several Italian and American
defendants - including the two
alleged masterminds of the abduc-
tion - were acquitted due to either
diplomatic immunity or because
classified information was stricken
by Italy's highest court.
The case has been politically
charged from the beginning, with
attempts to mislead investigators
looking into the cleric's disappear-
ance and derail the judicial pro-
ceedings once the trial was under
way. But the Italian-American rela-
tionship, conditioned on such issues
as participation in the Afghan cam-
paign, is unlikely to be hurt by the
convictions.
Three Americans were acquit-
ted, including the then-Rome
CIA station chief Jeffrey Castelli

LoC RU NO/
Italian Judge Oscar Magi convicted 23 Americans of the 2003 kidnapping of an Egyptian cleric in a CIA extraordinary rendi-
tion. Citing diplomatic immunity, he told a Milan courtroom yesterday he was acquitting three other Americans.

and two other diplomats formerly
assigned to the Rome Embassy, as
well as the former head of Italian
military intelligence Nicolo Pol-
lari and four other Italian secret
service agents.
Only two Italians were in the
courtroom to hear the verdict,
including Marco Mancini, the for-
mer No. 2 at Italian military intel-
ligence, who embraced his lawyer
outside the courtroom after he was

acquitted.
Former Milan CIA station chief
Robert Seldon Lady received the
top sentence ofeightyears in prison.
The other 22 convicted American
defendants, including De Sousa and
Air Force Lt. Col. Joseph Romano,
each received a five-year sentence.
Two Italians got three years each
as accessories.
U.S. State Department spokes-
man Ian Kelly said the Obama

administration was "disappointed
about the verdicts."
The State Department is being
sued by De Sousa, a former State
Department employee who
denies she was a CIA agent and
who believes she should have
been granted diplomatic immu-
nity by U.S. officials. The judge's
verdict, however, did not extend
diplomatic immunity to consular
officials charged.

Gay rights
activists blame
Obama for loss

Police find 11 corpses in
home of Ceveland man

Some say Obama's
lack of input key to
passage of Maine
gay marriage ban
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Stunned and angry, national gay
rights leaders yesterday blamed
scare-mongering ads - and
President Barack Obama's lack
of engagement - for a bitter elec-
tion setback in Maine that could
alter the dynamics for both sides
-inthe gay-naeriege-debate.
Conservatives, in contrast,
celebrated Maine voters' rejec-
tion of a law that would have
allowed gay couples to wed,
depicting it as a warning shot
that should deter politicians in
other states from pushing for
same-sex marriage.
"Every time the citizens have
voted on marriage, they have
always sided with natural mar-
riage," said Mathew Staver,
founder of Liberty Counsel, a Flor-
ida-based Christian legal group.
"Maine dramatically illustrates
the will of the people, and politi-
cians should wake up and listen."
Gay activists were frustrat-
ed that Obama, who insists he
staunchly supports their over-
all civil rights agenda, didn't
speak out forcefully in defense
of Maine's marriage law before
Tuesday's referendum. The law

was repealed in a vote of 53 per-
cent to 47 percent.
"President Obama missed an
opportunity to state his posi-
tion against these discrimina-
tory attacks with the clarity and
moral imperative that would
have helped in this close fight,"
said Evan Wolfson of the nation-
al advocacy group Freedom to
Marry. "The anti-gay forces are
throwing millions of dollars into
various unsubtle ads aimed at
scaring people, so subtle state-
ments from the White House are
not enough."
The White House, asked about
the criticism, had no immediate
comment.
The marriage debate is simmer-
ing in at least a half-dozen states
where a same-sex marriage bill is
pending or where a courtruling or
existing law is being eyed by con-
servatives for possible challenge.
Had Maine's law been upheld
by voters, it would have become
the sixth state to legalize gay
marriage - and the first to affirm
it by popular vote. In Massachu-
setts, Vermont, Connecticut,
New Hampshire and Iowa, gay
marriage resulted from court
decisions or legislation.
California is sure to be a major
battleground over the next sever-
al years. Last year, conservatives
succeeded in winning public
approval of Proposition 8, which
overturned a state court ruling
allowing gay marriage.

In crime-ridden
neighborhood, police
showed little concern
for missing women
CLEVELAND - The run-down
Cleveland neighborhood where
50-year-old Anthony Sowell qui-
etly carved out an existence is the
type of place where women can
disappear almost in plain sight.
Where crack users sneak into.
vacant houses to do drugs, have
sex, then steal copper pipes and
wiring to make a few bucks.
Where no one asks alot of ques-
tions, even about the smell of rot-
ting meat that came when the
wind blew a certain way. Some lik-
ened it to the smell of death, and it
seemed to follow Sowell around.
No one is sure how long Sow-
ell, a registered sex offender who
would offer free barbecue to the
neighbors, had been living in his
three-story house with corpses
lying around, many of them black

women who had been strangled.
Police have now recovered 11 bod-
ies from the home on Imperial
Avenue, in the living room, crawl
spaces and backyard graves. There
was even a skull in the basement.
But if Sowell's street is seedy,
it's far from abandoned. Occupied
homes are sandwiched between
vacant, boarded-up houses and
scattered small businesses with a
steady stream of customers.
"We're not talking about some
desolate area, some abandoned
barn," said Councilman Zach
Reed, whose mother lives a block
away. "How did somebody get
away with this in a residential
neighborhood?"
Even residents seemed unfazed
by the disappearances: They say
many of the women were known-
prostitutes or drug users. But rela-
tives of presumed victims charge
that police ignored their missing
person reports.
"They told us to go home, and as
soon as the drugs are gone, she'll
show up," said Markiesha Carmi-
chael-Jacobs, whose 53-year-old

mother Tonia, a drug addict, van-
ished Nov. 10, 2008. Police identi-
fied her Wednesday as one of the
victims, sayingher bodywas found
buried in the backyard with marks
indicating strangulation.
"It's hard to imagine," Carmi-
chael-Jacobs said as she stood
shivering on a street corner across
from Sowell's home Wednesday,
"but that's what they told us to our
face: 'She'll turn up."'
Some wonder whether police
just didn't look for the women
because they were fromthe city.
Or because they were black.
"There's this fear that the neigh-
borhood has been forgotten," said
the Rev. Rodney Maiden of Provi-
dence Baptist Church.
Cleveland police don't take
missing-personseases seriously if
they involve people clinging to the
lower rungs of society, said Judy
Martin, a leading local anti-crime
advocate.
Reed, the councilman, is
demanding an investigation into
how crime reports in the neigh-
borhood have been handled.

Despite Maine's ban, gay rights activists gaining ground
As the Election Day results began trickling in Wednesday
night, it became clear that gay marriage supporters had
suffered another stinging defeat at the hands of intoler-
ance. The voters of Maine turned their back on a law passed by
the legislature to finally extend legal recognition to gay partners.
This defeat, both shocking and distressing for gay rights support-
ers, makes Maine the 31st state to ban gay marriage in a popular
vote. But despite this setback, gay rights supporters are, slowly but
surely, gaining ground in their struggle. Advocates must stay strong
and keep fighting while the rest of the country grows steadily more
cognizant of the discrimination inherent in anti-gay marriage laws.

School spending solved

In May, Maine's legislature passed a law
giving same-sex couples the right to legally
wed - a huge step forward for equality in
the state. But implementation of the law
was put on hold because of a conservative
uproar calling for its repeal. Groups hop-
ing to get the law repealed in a referen-
dum launched a successful petition drive
and, ultimately, a same-sex marriage ban
made its way onto the ballot. The ban was
approved by 53 percent of the voters, mean-
ing that every time a gay marriage ban deci-
sion has come before a statewide vote, the
ban has passed.
But no matter how many states approve
them, bans on gay marriage are indefen-
sibly morally wrong. No degree of intoler-
ance can hide the fact that gay relationships
deserve the exact same legal recognition
that heterosexual marriage receives. Nei-
ther state nor federal governments should
have the right to hold certain marriages
less valid than others. That's because same-
sex relationships are just as legitimate and
loving as any heterosexual relationship,
and failing to recognize them is a travesty
of justice.
But despite the fact that one more state
has been added to the list of those who
banned gay marriage, the movement for
equality is gaining ground. Maine's ban

was passed by a much slimmer margin than
California's last year. Protect Maine Equal-
ity, the campaign to defeat the ban, raised
$1.5 million more than its opponents - an
impressive feat, as the opponents are usu-
ally extremely well funded. So even though
gay couples might feel further away from
their end goal, the tide is turning.
After all, important gains are being made
across the country. A Texas court recently
recognized an out-of-state same-sex mar-
riage couple and deemed the state's ban
unconstitutional. And on Election Day in
Michigan, Kalamazoo voters approved a
measure banning housing discrimination
based on sexual orientation. These victo-
ries may seem small, but they reflect the
basic fact that the gay rights movement will
ultimately prevail in convincing enough
Americans that gay relationships are lov-
ing, committed and healthy.
But this truth does not excuse the actions
of the voters of Maine or any of the other
states that banned gay marriage - includ-
ing Michigan. Same-sex marriage bans are
nothing more than codified discrimination,
and Americans need to realize that later
generations will view these bans the same
way we now view bans on interracial mar-
riage. States have an obligation to overcome
this parallel immediately.

ing. If there's some SOAVE
trend in there, I fail

of making some
broad generalization about how this
election reflects the country's mood,
P'm going to zoom in on just one vote
- the decisive'defeat of the Regional
Enhancement Millage in Washtenaw
County.
The millage would have raised
property taxes in Washtenaw Coun-
ty to solve a budget deficit of several
million dollars and generate $30 mil-
lion for the county each year for five
years. Property owners would pay an
additional $2 for every $1,000 of tax-
able assets, meaning that taxes would
have increased by about 11.4 percent.
But the millage was defeated, with 60
percent of voters in opposition.
Why? Washtenaw County residents
clearly didn't think they could afford
the tax increase, even for schools.
Indeed, annarbor.com quoted an Ypsi-
lanti resident as saying, "I took a big
pay cut ... I just couldn't afford to pay
more, as much as I would have liked
to." It's likely thatthis was the prevail-
ing sentiment among those voting no.
But because school funding can
only come from one tax source or
another, saying "we can't afford it" is
the same as saying "we are spending
too much." The only question, then, is
this: Are these voters right in thinking

that Michigan spends enough on edu-
cation?
Gov. Jennifer Granholm seemed
to agree with them when she vetoed
some of the funding for K-12 educa-
tion last week in the final version of
the state's budget for fiscal year 2010.
As if realizing for the first time that the
state is broke, Granholm cut per pupil
funding for schools by at least $292
per student. But this paints a bleaker
portrait than Michigan deserves.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau's
2007 data, Michigan spends $9,912
per pupil - so per-pupil funding is
really only decreasing by three per-
cent. Considering that Michigan was
already above the national average,
our schools probably aren't as badly
off as feared.
, But the Census Bureau data also
provides an answer to my origi-
nal question of whether Michigan
spends too much on education. As it
turns out, 'onlyvight states had more
revenue 'than Michigan to spend on
schools. When the revenue sources
were broken down into federal, state
and local sources, Michigan moved to.
fifth place for percentage of revenue
being generated at the state level. This
means that the percentage of revenue
for public education being generated
by Michigan taxpayers is greater than
in 45 other states. Does Michigan
really seem like it's financially secure
enough to give more money to educa-
tion than 45 of its neighbors?
The gut reaction to this might be,
"Well, at least they're spending lots of
money on top-of-the-line textbooks,
teaching materials, and facilities." But
the real cost of education is employee
compensation. Indeed, according to
the Daily, the Ann Arbor school dis-
trict spends 85 percent of its funds on
compensating employees. And accord-
ing to the Census Bureau data, Michi-
gan's public school employees receive

the seventh highest salary and benefit
packages ofallteachersinthe country.
All these numbers show that Michi-
gan clearly isn't lacking in its funding
of primary education - and that its
public teachers are well paid com-
pared with other states. Add in the
fact that public school teachers nation-
wide make 61 percent more than pri-
vate school teachers nationwide, and
what we have are some teachers who
certainly don't need increased state
funding to survive.
Quality education
needs concessions
from teachers.
Simitarly; it does not""take a mill-
age," as the pro-millage group's slogan
argued, to close budget gaps: We don't
need to fire anybody just because we
didn'tpass the millage. Werdon'tneed
to reduce curricula, downgrade text-
books, increase class sizes or cut arts
programs. We simply need to pay our
public teachers - who are already
paid better than those in other states,
and vastly better than private school
teachers - slightly less. This isn't an
unreasonable request, as workers in
other sectors across the country have
already accepted salary cuts in the
face of an inhospitable economy - and
in Michigan, especially.
This isn't about the kids. Michigan
can maintain the quality of its edu-
cational system if its employees will
accept compromises.

Addressing Congress on May
25, 1961, President John Ken-
nedy famously challenged the
United States to
land a man on the-
moon and bring
him home safely. At
the time, America8
- locked in an arms
race with the Soviet
Union, bursting
with national pride,
and looking starry- -
eyed toward theC
cosmos - was eas- CHRIS
ily convinced of the KOSLOWSKI
moon's profound -_
importance. The
public forked over
$25 billion for the Apollo program,
then one of the largest expenditures
ever by a nation in peacetime.
After funding cuts, a drastic
decrease in public interest and two
space shuttle disasters, NASA is des-
perate to rekindle America's love for
space exploration. Many of NASA's
most famous names, including Apollo
11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, are lobby-
ing hard to convince Congress and
President Barack Obama to earmark
more funding for a manned mission
to Mars. They claim a Mars program
is paramount to the advancement of
scientific discovery and the survival
of the space agency.
Former President George W. Bush
signed his Vision for Space Explo-
ration into law in late 2005. It set
milestones and appropriated fed-
eral dollars for a program slated to
return astronauts to the moon and
then, eventually, the red planet. As
research from the project progresses,
NASA and the public are quickly real-
izing that sending people to Mars is a
much harder, longer and more dan-
gerous endeavor than the 1960s moon
missions. And of course, the biggest

obstacle is cost.
Quoted in an article in the Tele-
graph this summer, Norman Augus-
tine, formerCEOof Lockheed Martin,
said, "With a few exceptions, we have
the technology or the knowledge that
we could go to Mars if we wanted
with humans." What we don't have,
between our tepid economy and the
trillions of dollars of new government
spending, is money to spare. It seems
unlikely that NASA will be able to
execute a Mars mission anytime soon
- that is, unless we ignore the second
criterion of Kennedy's challenge.
A way to cut costs that is gaining
popularity among space enthusiasts,
and even high-ranking directors at
NASA, is to send astronauts to Mars
but not bring them back. A one-way
ticket would eliminate the need to
transport fuel for the return trip, for,
a system to escape Mars's gravity, and
for a vehicle that could withstand re-
entry into Earth's atmosphere. The
cuts would save the taxpayers bil-
lions and trim years, maybe decades,
of preparation off the program's esti-
mated completion time.
John Olson, NASA's director of
exploration systems integration,
noted in an interview with The
Guardian that sending explorers on
one-way missions is not new. "It's
really no different than the pioneer-
ing spirit of many in past history,
who took the one-way trip across the
ocean, or the trip out west across the
United States with no intention of
ever returning."
Though I can't imagine ever want-
ing to spend my final days alone on a
dead, red rock millions of miles away
from the nearest companion, I sus-
pect many older space junkies, per-
haps even Aldrin himself, would be
thrilled to embark on such a historic
journey. After all, we all will even-
tually die. Why not end life with the

ultimate exclamation point of being
the first person to walk on Mars?
Humans are much more versatile
than unmanned probes at conduct-
ing experiments on alien worlds. A
human on Mars could help us learn
about the birth of our solar system
and the origins of life on Earth, and
maybe even begin to develop Mars as
a colony that could save our species if
Earth ever becomes unviable.
Still, I just can't support sending an *
astronaut to his or her death only to
cut costs. Perhaps if a one-way ticket
was the only way to send someone to
Mars, I would think differently. The
potential for boundless scientific dis-
covery justifies a considerable amount
We need to make
sure we can bring
astronauts home.
of risk. But a no-return mission would
ultimately send the message that an
astronaut's life is worth the amount
of dollars and years saved by not
devising a way to bring him home,
and that's wrong. Even in war, when
civilian lives are at stake, the U.S.
government does not send soldiers on
missions with zero chance of return.
I think it's wise to keep Kennedy's
words in mind as we reach out to our
red, celestial neighbor. We chose to
go to the moon and we choose now to
go to Mars, not because it's easy, but
because it's hard. Sending an Ameri-
can on a one-way mission to save a
few billion dollars, even if the rewards
would be great, is the easy way out.

AFTER THEY WALK
From Page 1A
red hair flying everywhere, and
though she was frazzled she always
had time to talk through problems
with her friends.
Burgess added that Miller always
takes the time to meet with her son,
who lives in Washington, something
especially important to Burgess
given that she lives in Australia.
"She just has a way with people,"
Burgess said. "Most of our friends
would tell you the same thing. No
matter how busy she is, no matter
how's she's risen in the Washington
scene, she's always made time for
her personal friends."
And her ease in communicat-
ing has helped her professionally
as well. David Feldman, a partner
at Nixon Peabody who has worked
with Miller on countless cases said
she's just as comfortable talking
about the Wolverines' most recent
football game as she is talking about
a legal brief.
"She's obviously incredibly smart
and a terrific lawyer but I think what
sets her apart from a lot of other
people that you could say the same
things about is that she has a really
unique talent for making everyone
on a team feel like they are an essen-
tial component of the team," he said.
"Laurie just has a knack for commu-
nicating in a way that makes every-
one feel invested in the effort."
Miller even got the chance to
try out her communication skills
overseas. She was chosen as one
of 10 lawyers by the American Bar
Association to travel to Sudan and
train Sudanese lawyers to represent
refugees from Darfur in the Inter-
national Criminal Court.

(LEFT) Laurie Miller (second from right) was one of 10 legal experts chosen by the American Bar Association to travel to Sudan and train Sudanese lawyers to represent refugees from Darfur in the International
Criminal Court. (RIGHT) Miller with then-Sen. Barack Obama at a fundraiser for the National Women's Forum for Obama at the Woolly Mammoth Theatre in Washington D.C. in 2007.

During the process, Miller was
adamant that all parties be able to
talk with each other on the trip,
despite language barriers.
"I insisted that we get interpret-
ers because otherwise how would
we to be able to communicate?"
Miller said. "And ultimately I was
pretty tenacious, probably stubborn
was the better word for it."
But even once interpreters were
secured for the trip, Miller wasn't
satisfied because they would only be
working with the group from 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
"What happens at breakfast?
How do we.talk to people if we have
different languages," she said. "I
went down to Borders - a tradition
from my Ann Arbor days - and I
picked up Arabic tapes about three
weeks before we went and played
them non-stop in and out of work
so at least when I was sitting down
with people I could ask them how

they were."
In addition to representing the
ABA on the trip, Miller is also the
managing director of the group's lit-
igation section. Though she's risen
to prominence in the legal commu-
nity - she was named one of the 50
most influential women lawyers by
the National Law Journal - the law,
her first love, has been her second
career.
After graduating from the Uni-
versity in 1974, Miller relocated to
Cambridge, Mass. to pursue a joint
degree in public policy from Har-
vard University's Kennedy School
of Government and a law degree
from Harvard Law School. But her
dreams of becoming a lawyer were,
put on hold.
"The only really sad part of this
entire story is that when I was at

the Kennedy School my dad got very
sick,"shesaid."Hehad a heart attack,
which he ultimately died from, but it
meant that I didn't have the resourc-
es to do a four-year degree."
So Miller came back to Washing-
ton, and by then Gerald Ford had
become president. She worked in a
consulting firm for a couple of years
until she was able to get a job in gov-
ernment, when Jimmy Carter was
elected president.
She worked as a special assistant
to Joseph Califano, the then-Secre-
tary of the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare and a larg-
er-than-life character. Eventually
Miller became the deputy director
of the United States Administration
for Children, Youth and Families.
At 25, Miller was suddenly in
charge of a $1.4 billion budget and
440 people.
"I would probably be terrified to
take the job now, 30 years later, but

at the time I didn't know enough to
be scared," she said.
But Helen Kanovsky, the gen-
eral counsel for the Department of
Housing and Urban Development,
who worked with Miller during her
time in the Carter administration,
said Miller was wise beyond her
years.
"As a policy person and as a man-
ager she was superb," she said. "And
I got to say I'm shocked that some-
one as young as she was did as phe-
nomenal a job as she did."
Many of Miller's friends and col-
leagues attribute her success to her
unique mix of raw intelligence and
unmatched sensitivity to the needs
of others. But Miller said she owes=
much of her good fortune to the
place where she spent many Foot-
ball Saturdays and nights with her
friends at the nearby watering hole,
the Village Bell.
"My experience at Michigan was

a fortunate one," she said. "It was a
gender-neutral series of opportuni-
ties and I'm not sure I really under-
stood when I arrived in 1970 how
lucky I was to be experiencing that.
That comes on the backs of gen-
erations of women having to plow
ground in order to give me those
opportunities and I've felt pretty
strongly ever since that I in turn
have an obligation to other young
women coming up."
But it's not just the University's
women that Miller tries to look out
for. She's the chair of the Michigan
in Washington program and always
makes herself available as a mentor
to the students in the program.
"Michigan was very important to
me," she said. "Mydad was avegeta-
ble salesman. Michigan gave me all
sorts of opportunities that I never
would've had otherwise, it's quite
clear to me that it's a debt I want to
repay all my life."

concerns.
An LSA senior, who asked to
remain anonymous because of the
sensitive nature of the issue, wrote
in an e-mail interview about diffi-
culties scheduling an appointment
through CAPS and issues with the
computer assessments students
take when first entering CAPS.
"After taking this assessment,
students have to wait a few weeks
to even see someone about what-
ever they're dealing with," the
student wrote in the e-mail. "I
have some serious problems that I
quite honestly need someone pro-
fessional to talk about."
"I know I'm not the only one
in this university who could use
someone to talk to about the shit
going on in their lives," the stu-
dent added.
The student's longest wait time
for an appointment was two weeks
and a few days, which the student
said was "quite a long time."
Sevigsaid CAPS is as concerned
about the extended waiting period
as students are.
"We don't like it when the wait
stretches either," he said. "What's
hard from an administrative point
of view is that there is no one
magic wait period that is accepted
by every student so we literally
make 3,000 individual decisions
for what's best for each of those
students."
Vicki Hays, CAPS's associate
director, said students who go
to CAPS have the option to see a
counselor on duty, who students
can choose to see from the very
first time they come in or when-
ever they feel it necessary.
She added that the counselor
on duty is available from 9 a.m. to
6 p.m. every day, and sometimes
there are two on duty.

whereas many counseling centers
at other universities only have the
option available for a few hours.
"Students do have that choice,"
he said. "But the reality is that
sometimes waiting for that sched-
uled appointment is a perfect fit
for students. There are multiple
ways that people get in and we
work with every individual stu-

few (other bars that offered poker)
that used to be in the area, but
(they) aren't open that often."
Cheryl Altman, charity coordi-
nator, said the notion of poker is a
no-brainer for charities.
"A charity bar in downtown Ann
Arbor is a sure thing," she said. "It's
just natural."
"Students should not be intimi-
dated in coming here," Cheryl Alt-
man said. "We do keep in mind that
students wilihe playing, We want
to have tables for people with less
money in their pockets, and one for
those with more and maybe one in
the iniddle."'............
Nonprofits can book the poker
room for $50 per night in order to
benefit their causes, whether rais-
dent to make something happen."
Hays said CAPS is busiest in the
fall semester because there is an
increase in students coming to the
center and officials are busy orga-
nizing training programs.
From Sept. 1 to Oct. 23 there
had been 747 first appointments
scheduled at the rate of about 93
per week, 75 psychiatric evalu-
ations scheduled, 240 counselor
on duty contacts at an average of
about 30 per week, and 69 stu-
dents seen for pre-support group
interviews. Many groups are
already up and running.
Hays said that on average CAPS
sees around 3,000 students a year.
Sevig said officials are doing
everything they can to accommo-
date students' needs and shorten
the wait time, but the center is
maxed outintermsofspace, which
is why he is looking forward to the
completion of the new offices.
"We're trying to increase our
capacity to see more students
more quickly," he said.
Sevig added that the assess-
ment students need to fill out
on their first visit to CAPS takes
about 7 to 10 minutes and is simi-
lar to paperwork that is required
at other health care offices.
"All health care units need
some information ahead of time,"
he said. "We have not forced stu-
dents to be short or to be long. We
leave it up to each student to let us
know as much or as little as they
want."
Music, Theatre & Dance sopho-
more Rachael Albert wrote in an
e-mail interview that she went
to CAPS after being convinced
by a close friend that it would be
helpful for her sometime before
Thanksgiving last year. She didn't
get an appointment until Dec. 8.
She said the meeting she had
was very superficial and didn't
really address her concerns.
Albert added that at the conclu-
sion of her session her counselor
told her that CAPS was busier
than ever and that it seemed as if
she has worked out all her issues
and therefore it wasn't necessary
to make another appointment,
though she could if she wanted to.
"It was entirely inappropri-
ate and left me feeling like crap
because it took so much willpower
for me to decide to go in the first
place and I was shut down," she
wrote. "I honestly felt worse leav-

ing money for a loved one or educa-
tional institutions.
For the charity on a given week,
it is very hard to lose money on
tournament days since the nonprof-
its only pay $50 per night. Because
the charity gets a portion of each
player's cover charge, the amount
raised does not fluctuate based on
whether the player wins or loses.
After radio and television atten-
tion, Mark Sackrison, owner and
pit boss of the upstairs poker
room, said he hopes more people
will attend the poker nights. At
a Wednesday night tournament
recently;- Sackrison estimated
the two full tables would raise
between $1,500 and $2,200 for
charity.
ing than I did going."
CAPS's 2007-2008 annual
report says that in the year 2000-
2001, CAPS provided services for
1,914 students compared to 3,032
students in 2007-08, represent-
ing a 58-percent increase in that
time.
"We want to be able to meet all
these needs but the connection is
that no one entity is able to meet
all of those needs all of the time
for all students," Sevig said.
The student who wished to
remain anonymous wrote in the
e-mail that from personal expe-
rience, students can only see
one counselor for three sessions
before they are scheduled with
another.
"Three sessions aren't enough
to help resolve much of anything,"
the student said. "Of course the
student can come back, but they
get placed with a new CAPS
employee and they have to start
explaining their problems all over
again."
"That's more stressful than
anything," the student added. "It's
frustrating and exhausting."
Sevig said that this is not
CAPS's policy.
"We would never do that
because that's not how health
care works," he said. "We have a
service decision that takes each
case on its own instead of a one-
policy-fits-all and I think that in
the end is better health care for
college students."
Hays said that at many similar
colleges, students are limited to
only 12 visits to the counseling
center in the entire four years
they are enrolled, but that is not
the case at CAPS.
"We would never want to do
that," Hays said. "If somebody has
a struggle sophomore year and
later wanted to talk about what
they want to do when they gradu-
ate their senior year, we want to
be able to serve them at both of
those-occasions."
Hays said CAPS tries to make
the best decisions based on its
resources and on students' issues
and needs.
She added that sometimes a
student would be referred to a
different counselor who may be
better suited to help the student,
but overall there is no set limit to
the number of sessions a student
can have.

According to Sackrison, if the
poker room turns out to be full, the
charity can make between $7,000
and $10,000.
"The charity technically sets the
rules," Sackrison said. "We try to
run the room as close to a casino as
possible."
According to Sackrison, many
other poker rooms are closing
because of insufficient funds and

For Friday, Nov. 6, 2009
ARIES
(March 21 to April 19)
For many, especially early Aries, this
is an eventful time with partnerships and
close friendships. You're moving into a
new era.
TAURUS
(April 20 to May 20)
You continue to search for ways to
best express yourself through your work.
Many of you have increased responsibil-
ities with children now as well.
GEMINI
(May 21 to June 20)
You feel more confident about where
you live. For the past several years, you
tried to establish a secure home for your-
self. (And you're succeeding!)
CANCER
(June21 to July 22)
The challenges offjob changes and res-
idential moves in the past few years are
beginning to diminish. Nevertheless, the
dust has not completely settled.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Continue to strive to get out of debt. In
the next year, your financial scene will
improve. However, that time has not yet
arrived.
VIRGO
(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)
It's been such a struggle during the
past two to three years. You'll be happy
to know that the struggle is almost com-
ing to an end, but not quite yet. Courage!
LIBRA
(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)
You have a hint this year, and most
definitely after June of next year, of a
new cycle that you're entering. You're
getting ready to completely reinvent
yourself.
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)

In the next few years, many of you
will start to dismantle much of what
you've created sitce 1999. It's time to
get rid of whatever is no longer relevant
in your life in terms of people, places
and possessions.
SAGITTARIUS
(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)
You soon will have the challenge of
learning how to work sith groups and, at
the same time, maintain your own
integrity and independence. Not an easy
juggling act!
CAPRICORN
(Dec. 22 toJan. 19)
Since 1996, and then again in 2003,
you made an effort to go in a specific
direction. By next year, you will achieve
that time of harvest for which you have
been steadily working. Finally!
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)
In the past few years, the support from
others has diminished or disappeared.
Finally, you can see a light at the end of
the tunnel. And it's not a train!
PISCES
(Feb. 19 to March 20)
Although the resources of others are
dimiiishing, in turn, your own goad far-
tune is gointio grow ini 2(110. You win
some; you lose some.
YOU BORN TODAY Even if you are
soft-spoken. you have a rousing energy
about you. People respond to you
because you have an innate ability to
stimulate them. (In part, this is due to
your strong enthusiasm for life.) You
have a playful side, full of humor and
pranks. You're very physical in your
approach to life. Your year ahead will
focus on partnerships and close friend-
ships.

LIP GLOSS
0 From Page 1A
Nimeh also said the kit is not
as convenient as it appears and
that many people who would buy
the kit would also be taking more
protective measures at a party.
"Because it's not the lip gloss
that actually changes colors, but a
strip that changes colors it looks
more like a marketing technique
or not all that convenient," she
said. "If you were going to be that
vigilant, there are probably other
risk-reduction techniques that
you could use."
LSA junior Elana Mendelowitz
said she would consider using the
product.
"I haven't heard of definite
cases on this campus but it's defi-
nitely an issue on college campus-
es. It can't be denied that it's an
issue and I think people should
he wary of it," she said. "Girls
carry around lip gloss all the time
so why not just get this lip gloss
and they can help themselves and
each other."
LSA freshman Sarah Loeb also
said she would try out the prod-
uct.
"I don't wear lip gloss that
much, but I think I would wear
this one if I had the option," she
said. "That way I would be able
to test my drink just in case I was
concerned."
Whittaker said she first got the
idea to create a compact date rape
testing kit 18 months ago when
she was in a bar in Belfast, Eng-
land and was advised by the bar-
tender to be wary of spiking after
heing given a drink hy a man she
didn't know.
When she arrived home, she
looked up ways to test if a drink
had been spiked and found that
the smallest kit on the market
was the size of a credit card, and
she believed no ordinary woman
would want to go out with it in
tow.
"It's one of those things girls
don't go out without (lip gloss),"
Whittaker said. "The whole con-
cept is look gorgeous but stay in
control."

best express yourself through your work.
Many of you have increased responsibil-
ities with children now as well.
GEMINI

You feel more confident about where
you live. For the past several years, you
tried to establish a secure home for your-
self. (And you're succeeding!)
CANCER
(June 21 toJuly 22)
The challenges ofjob changes and res-
idential moves in the past few years are
beginning to diminish. Nevertheless, the
dust has not completely settled.
LEO
(July 23 to Aug. 22)
Continue to strive to get out of debt. In
the next year, your financial scene will
improve. However, that time has not yet
arrived.
VIRGO

ing toan end, but not quite yet. Courage!
LIBRA
(Sept. 23to Oct. 22)
You have a hint this year, and most
definitely after June of next year, of a
new cycle that you're entering. You're
getting ready to completely reinvent
yourself.
SCORPIO
(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)
0 2009 King Featu

get rid of whatever is no longer relevant
in your life in terms of people, places
and possessions.
SAGITTARIUS

learning how to work with groups and, at
the same time, maintain your own

direction. By next year, you will achieve
that time of harvest for which you have
been steadily working. Finally!
AQUARIUS
(Jan. 20to Feb. 18)
In the past few years, the support from
others has diminished or disappeared.
Finally, you can see a light at the end of
the tunnel. And it's not a train!
PISCES
(Feb. 19to March 20)
Although the resources of others are
diminishing, in turn, your own good for-
tune is going to grow in 2010. You win
some; you lose some.
YOU BORN TODAY Even if you are
soft-spoken, you have a rousing energy
about you. People respond to you
because you have an innate ability to

pranks. You're very physical in your
approach to life. Your year ahead will
focus on partnerships and close friend-
ships.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

0-line again facing changes

By ANDY REID
Daily Sports Editor
The argument could easily be
made that the Michigan football
team lives and dies with the play
of its offensive line.
The Wolverines controlled the
line of scrimmage against Notre
Dame, rackingup almost200 yards
on the ground and giving quarter-
back Tate Forcier plenty of time
to throw - which came in handy
when he tossed the game-winning
pass to Greg Mathews.
In Michigan's win over Eastern
Michigan, the offensive line domi-
nated almost every snap, easily
opening huge holes for the run-
ning backs. The Wolverines post-
ed nearly 400 rushing yards and
cruised to victory..
But the line has been just as
critical in Michigan's losses.
The Penn State defense was in
the backfield all day. Excluding
the Wolverines' smooth game-
opening drive, Michigan managed
just 74 rushing yards, and Forcier
was sacked five times.
And the line's influence on the
game was never more apparent
than last weekend. Against Illi-
nois - which, statistically, has the
worst rushing defense in the Big
Ten - Michigan had a first and
goal from the one-yard line, with
a chance to grab a touchdown and
push its lead to 20-7.
Four plays later, the Fighting
Illini took over on downs.
"Coming off the sideline not
converting on those four plays was
rough, and obviously was the turn-
ing point in the game," left guard
Steve Schilling said at Monday's
press conference. "We could have
been a lot more physical. It defi-
nitely wasn't scheme."
The line must make a commit-
ment to play more physically this
weekend, when Purdue comes
to the Big House for a game that
could determine both team's bowl
fates.
Although the Boilermakers,

have right guard Mark Huyge shift
out to'tackle and have Omameh fill
in at guard. Omameh will continue
to take reps at both positions.
Yesterday, Rodriguez confirmed
that the latter may be more prob-
able, saying, "We're looking at Pat-
rick Omameh more at guard than
tackle."
"The game was kind of new to
him," Rodriguez said. "He was
kind of a late developer coming out
of high school, and obviously last
year he redshirted and has got-
ten bigger and stronger. I'm really
excited about the future with Pat-
rick."
The backups' increased role
doesn't mean they're necessar-
ily seeing more action in practice,
though. Because of the tempo that
Rodriguez likes to bring to his
practices, he's able to give all of his
linemen equal reps throughout the
week.
"Our second group gets as many
reps as our first group, anyway,"
Rodriguez said. "It's just some-
times we haven't rotated some of
those second guys in with the first
group. We've done a little more
this week out of necessity and try-
ing to find the right mix."
The line isn't the only position
group that could see changes.
Rodriguez has maintained all
seasonthat whoever earns the spot
will play, which has allowed walk-
ons like safety Jordan Kovacs and
linebacker Kevin Leach to crack
the starting lineup.
Players, specifically on defense,
may get more opportunities for
playing time this week and moving
forward this season.
"There are some spots that guys
are still battling," Rodriguez said.
"We're trying to get more depth
defensively. That's been the big
issue. We have not played nearly
as many guys as we've liked to, but
again, sometimes that's because the
guys behind the guys that are start-
ing aren't quite ready yet. That's
something that we've tried to devel-
op, but they're just not there yet."

who give up almost 170 rushing
yards every game, shouldn't pose
too many problems for the Michigan
offense, the Wolverines will want to
keep Purdue's potent passing attack
off the field for as long as possible.
But finding that physical play
might be an issue - the Wolverines
have struggled to find consistency
up front since center David Molk,
who anchored the line for the first
three games of the season, was side-
lined with injuries to his foot and
anterior cruciate ligament.
The Wolverine offensive line has
had four different starting lineups,
and a fifth could be employed this
weekend.
At yesterday's press conference,

Rodriguez announced that right
tackle Perry Dorrestein, who has
started the last six games, has been
having issues with his back that
could keep him from playing on Sat-
urday.
"(His back problem) has been
ongoing," Rodriguez said. "He's
been fighting it every week, and
it flared up a little with him in last
week's ballgame. He's been battling
that the last couple weeks, really."
Dorrestein's injury has forced
backup players like Patrick Omameh
and Ricky Barnum to step up - and
Omameh may start this weekend
against the Boilermakers.
Omameh may replace Dorrestein
at right tackle, or Rodriguez may

With the distinction as the
No. 1 team in the country and an
appearance in the NCAA Tour-
nament championship game last
season, the Miami (Ohio) hockey
team certainly has high hopes.
But nothing will compare to
what The Miami Student - the
school's student newspaper' -
had to say in Oct. 2007 about the
team.
"Miami has all the necessary
components to become a dynasty
in the world of collegiate hockey,"
beat writer Mike Zoller wrote.
Since then, the phrase has
caught fire in Oxford.
But the Michigan hockey team,
who has reached just as many
Frozen Fours (one) as Miami in
the past two years, hasa few con-
tentions with that claim.
"A dynasty, huh?" said junior
forward Matt Rust, baffled by the
claim.
And although a hockey dynasty
at Miami may be a bit of a stretch,
the fact remains the Michigan-
Miami matchup is slowly becom-
ing one of college hockey's most
anticipated weekend series.
Last year, in Michigan's first
series against the RedHawks,
the Wolverines came up with
just one goal on the weekend and
were swept in Oxford.
But back in Ann Arbor two
months later, Michigan gave
Miami a taste of their own defen-
sive medicine, sweeping the Red-
Hawks in convincing fashion and
only allowing one goal on the
weekend.
The budding rivalry has been
gaining steam ever since the
Wolverines' 14-game winning
streak (1998-2003) against the
RedHawks snapped. Although
Michigan holds a 43-3-1 record
against the RedHawks atYost Ice
Arena, the Wolverines are hesi-
tant to get too confident - espe-
cially against the No. 1 team in
the country.
For junior goaltender Bryan

michigandaily.com.
Hogan, not having to play at
Miami's Goggin Ice Arena this
year is a lucky break for the Wol-
verines and especially for him as
Michigan's netminder.
"Those fans are ruthless,"
Hogan said. "And the warm-ups
were the worst part of the game.
Every time your own guy scored
on you, they'd cheer. So our team
had a little thing, I'd tell them,
'Make sure .you guys hit me and
don't score during warm-ups.'
They're crazy."
That intensity surrounding
the matchup has contributed to
the creation of the CCHA's new-
est rivalry. And although the
game doesn't hold the same sig-
nificance as an in-state or Big Ten
rivalry game might, the fact that
these teams are often in the con-
ference's top few slots has made
it competitive in itself.
"You can tell that (the Red-
Hawks) just believe in them-
selves now," Michigan coach Red
Berenson said. "They've got the
record to go with it, and there's
been some good games between
us. It's another real strong pro-
gram in our league. Just like
Notre Dame has emerged, Miami
has been emerging for some
time."
This year, with the two teams
separated by just three spots in
the national rankings, the sig-
nificance of this weekend's series
is paramount for the rest of the
conference slate.
And since Miami is not in the
Wolverines' conference cluster
this season, Michigan will only
get two shots at defeating what
they call "the best offense in the
country."
"Obviously, you want to beat
the No. 1 team in the country,"
freshman forward Chris Brown
said. "As far as a rivalry goes, it's
going to be a bloodbath on the
ice."

THEY'RE AS SIGNIFICANT AS EVER, BUT
ANN ARBOR RECORD STORES
CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE
BY JOSHUA BAYER
Daily Music Editor

.-ilking into Encore
Records is like stum-
bling into a corn maze,
a disheveled college bed-
room and a natural history
museum all at once - just 20
times more overwhelming than
any of those places. The walls are
practically crawling with musi-
cal artifacts from the past century,
teeming with an otherworldly sort
of life that's completely missing
when you're browsing for obscure
records on allmusic.com.
But as daunting as
walking into a
"mom-and-
pop" record
store can be,
there's also
something incredibly
warm and fuzzy about browsing
records in a culture den surround-
ed by fellow music lovers. There's
something magical about pulling
a vinyl record from a shelf based
purely on the merit of its cover art,
handing it to the store clerk and
having him play it for you.
This might all sound hunky-
dory, but if the financial wallop

to these stores continues, this expe-
riencecould be gone faster thanyou
can say "Lady GaGa."
it's disturbing to consider how
much the market for these home-
spun businesses has col-
lapsed over the years.
"Ten to 15
years ago,
there were
actually
about 12
record
stores
in (Ann
Arbor). There
was a way over-
supply," says John
Kerr, the owner of

Wazoo Records.
"And, slowly but surely, they've
all crumbled and there's just four
now, really," he says. "And probably
all four of those stores, including
us, are struggling ... I don't really
think there's too manypeople doing
real well in this business."
But thanks to the sweat and
blood of these record store own-
ers - and a miraculous stroke of
cultural karma - these shops are
still around, although the payout
is slim.

this," says Matt Bradish of Ann
Arbor's Underground Sounds. "I
am not rich. I work a tremendous
workload. Most people wouldn't
even contemplate the time commit-
ment."
To Peter Dale of Encore, Brad-
ish of Underground Sounds, Kerr
of Wazoo and Marc and Jeff Taras
of PJ's, owning a record store isn't
a business - it's a crusade. And if
the record industry continues to
slump, these precious cultural hubs
of community-serving self sacrifice
could become an endangered spe-
cies.
THE INTERNET: FRIEND AND FOE
In many ways, the Internet has
been responsible for the economic
pickle in which record stores have
recently found themselves. Accord-
ing to Dale, the value of CDs has
dropped at least 50 percent in the
last three years due to the massive
availability of albums online.
"(Prices are) gonna continue to
go down," he says. "That's just the
way it is."
And Kerr adds that Wazoo has
certainly been outsourced by sites
like Amazon.com that conveniently
"sell legitimate CDs on the Internet
and have unparalleled selections."
Still, record store owners have
found ways to harness the Inter-
net's vastness in their favor. Dale
mentions how the Internet has
made it much easier to advertise to
international markets.
"There's just not enough demand
locally to sell a 50- or 100- or
200-dollar record," he says. "You
have to find the audience, and the
audience is national if not interna-
tional."
Back in the Stone Age, record

store owners had to slog
through the cumbersome process
of posting countless ads in specialty
collectors magazines and newspa-
per auctions. Now, they can simply
put pricey rarities up for grabs on
their websites and wait for some-
one anywhere on planet Earth to
bite.
Dale also thinks the Internet has
"made the prices of records truer."
"Before, there were some things
that were 'collectible',when they
really weren't. They were just
regionally hard to find," he says.
"Now, everything can be found
- so the true value of stuff is appar-
ent. You canjust check online to see
what things are selling for on eBay."
In fact, both Dale and Kerr have
even started selling merchandise
on Amazon and eBay, despite the
loomingcorporate cloud these mar-
ketplace conglomerates have cast
on the "little guys."
As Kerr says, "You've gotta figure
out a way to make the Internet work
for you to some degree. There's no
stopping it."

for
it."
And, appar-
ently, about how
we should be getting
it too.
Given the prime real
estate these stores occupy on
campus, the expected collegiate
frequenters have been surprisingly
infrequent.
Dale observes that his target
demographic at Encore has com-
pletely shifted away from the col-
lege-age bracket.
"Most of my customers are from
out of town," he says. "I don't adver-
tise on campus because the average
person on campus doesn't buy stuff.
They just take it off the Internet."
Drew Leahy, president of
MyBandStock (a website that
allows fans to purchase "stock" in
a band in exchange for exclusive
access to band footage and updates),
exemplifies this cultural swing.
He reluctantly described how he
was recently in a record store and
couldn't connect with it, despite his
desire to do so.
"I like to search for music
on a search engine and lis-
ten to a couple things and
then decide what I like,"
he says. "This (record

The fall of the
Obama Age

ell, it was a good 12
months for the Demo-
crats. They had their
fun: their Nobel Prizes, their
Equal Pay Acts,
their Portu-
guese Water
Dogs. But all
good things
O must come to f.
an end. And
Tuesday night,
the Obama Age ZACH
ended not with SMWVTZ
a whimper, but
with something significantly qui-
eter than a whimper.
On Tuesday night, Republican
governors swept into power with
wins in both Virginia and New
Jersey, states soon-to-be-former
President Barack Obama won just
a year ago. In Virginia, state Sen.
Creigh Deeds got the Creigh beat
out of him by Attorney General
Bob McDonnell. McDonnell ran
a smooth and positive campaign
on issues like jobs, taxes and, well
that was actually it: just jobs and
taxes. Meanwhile his opponent,
Deeds, brought up irrelevant
points about whether gays and
women deserve equal rights just
like the rest of us.
Deeds pointed to McDonnell's
1989 master's thesis wherein the
now governor-elect wrote, "gov-
ernment policyshould favor mar-
ried couples over 'cohabitators,
homosexuals or fornicators.' " But
this was just the guy's 93-page
thesis. As college students, we've
all faced due dates and in a fren-
zied panic, and with three or four
Red Bulls in us, we have likely
written some pretty wacky stuff.
Who hasn't, as the witching hour
approaches, scribbled down a
page or two saying that working
women and feminists were "detri-
mental" to the American family?
Who cares if McDonnell spent lit-
erally years working on the thesis
and gave it the meaningless title
"The Republican Party's Vision
for the Family"? These were just
Bobby's wild college years when
he was 35 years old and attend-
ing televangelist Pat Robertson's
Regent University, a fundamental-
ist Christian safety school.
Before the election, McDonnell
said, "Like everybody, my views
on many issues have changed as I
have gotten older."
Of course, his views have
changed. Except on gay rights.
And abortion rights. And whether
government policy should favor
married couples over cohabitators,
homosexuals or fornicators. But
beyond that, he's a changed man.
Congrats, Virginia. You guys
must be partying like it's 1949,
because your new governor cer-
tainly thinks it still is.
A bigger upset came in the
solidly blue home state of Zach
Braff: New Jersey. There, former
United States Attorney and Tony
Soprano look-a-like Chris Christie
ousted incumbent governor and
all-around unlikable person Jon
Corzine by a five-point margin.
This race was a dirty one, even by
New Jersey standards. (Fun Fact:
New Jersey is dirty.)
First, Corzine made thinly
veiled attempts to point out
Christie's, let's say, ample car-
riage. After running ads accusing
Christie of "throwing his weight
around" while U.S. attorney, a
reporter asked Corzine, "Is Chris
Christie fat?" to which the gover-

nor responded, "Am I bald?" (Fun
Fact: Jon Corzine is very bald.)
Christie, usinghis ownbrand
of dirty tricks, called Corzine a
failed governor who broke numer-
ous campaign promises including
a promise to lower New Jersey's
property taxes, which are the
highest in the nation. Christie
also brought up the fact that
Corzine spent tens of millions of
dollars of his own money on his
re-election campaign - money
he made while helping to lay the
foundation for the complete deci-
mation of the world economy as
co-CEO of Goldman Sachs in the
mid-1990s. Sometimes politics is
an ugly, dirty, fat, bald business,
all right.
In his concession speech Cor-
zine concluded, "There's a bright
future ahead for New Jersey if we
stay focused on people's lives, and
I'm telling you, I'm going to do
that for the rest of my life," before
adding: "Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got to finish reinforcing the
floor boards at the Governor's
Mansion before Chris Christie
moves in. Ohhhh!" In New Jersey,

even the political winds have an
unsafe level of toxic materials.
There was only one gloomy
spot in what was otherwise a
total rebuffing of Obama and his
socialist agenda. In New York's
sleepy 23rd district, Democrat
Bill Owens squared off against
Conservative Party candidate
Doug Hoffman. Hoffman became
Owens' only opponent after Dede
Scozzafava, the Republican nomi-
nee, dropped out after weeks of
hammering from the True-Right-
Wing-Nut wing of the Republican
Party.
Scozzafava, who is pro-choice
and supports equal rights for
same-sex couples, infuriated real
conservatives who looked to Hoff-
man to save the cause. Storied
public servants like Sarah Palin,
Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck,
who of course all understand the
intricacies and cultural differ-
ences between, say, Wasilla and
Watertown, New York, joined the
fight against the GOP candidate
and gotbehind Hoffman. What
a win for the Tea Party move-
ment and those who see some
eerie similarities between Barack
Obama and Chairman Mao.
Everyone assunted that Hoff-
man, the conservative, would
walk to victory with a wide fund-
raising advantage and the fact the
North Country of New York hasn't
voted for a Democrat for Congress
in a while. The last Democratic
congressional candidate to win
upstate was almost 150 years ago
during the Civil War. (Fun Fact:
The previous sentence is true.)
But those pesky voters, upset
that Hoffman didn't actually live
in the district, received most of
his funding from out of state and
has policy positions that makes
Phyllis Schlafly look like Kim
Kardashian, decided to vote for
the Democrat. But the Conserva-
tives made their message loud and
clear: If the Republicans don't
nominate the exact same candi-
date with the exact same views in
every, single race, they'll have no
choice but to let the Democrat win
every time.
"But why," I hear you cry, "does
this threaten the Obama agenda?"
Well, it's simple: because everyone
says it does. In politics, it doesn't

matter if it's true, it just matters if
you invent a compelling narrative
and repeat it ad nauseam through-
out the news cycle. It doesn't mat-
ter that the president's approval
ratings in Virginia and New Jersey
are exactly the percentage of the
vote he received last November.
It doesn't matter that Virginia
has voted for the opposite party
for governor than it did for presi-
dent for the last eight elections. It
doesn't matter that this grab bag of
races has absolutely no bearing on
and indicates nothing about what
will happen in next year's mid-
terms or Obama's reelection bid in
2012. All that matters is that these
races are seen as a referendum on
the president and his policies, no

matter how untrue that may actu-
ally be.

Whip and runner-up for world's
greatest self-hating Jew - coming

deftly interpreted what America
was saying in these off-off year,
low turnout elections: "Enough
with the spending. Enough with
the waste. Enough with the
government overreach. They've
rejected the policies that have
been what this administration in
Washington has been about."
It's a perfect story. Just ask
The New York Times, which
ran this headline Wednesday:
"Governor's Races Seen as Jolts
for Obama." It's good to know
that whether it's the Republican
Party or The New York Times,
politicos never let the facts get in
the way of a good story.

Aunt Agatha's is one of only two mystery-themed bookstores in Michigan.

Mysteries admr

Aunt Agatha's Mystery Bookstore offers a
peculiar haven for whodunit enthusiasts
By Molly McGuire ( Daily Arts Writer

Jamie Agnew had a collection of
skulls before he and his wife Robin
opened Aunt Agatha's Mystery
Bookstore in downtown Ann Arbor
17 years ago. But stacked on top of
a bookshelf near the entrance, sur-
rounded by old movie posters and
mystery authors' signatures, the
collections looks like it was assem-
bled specificallyto add to the store's
eclectic ambiance.
A sign near the door on the
store's Fourth Street location says
"the game is afoot," and upon enter-
ing one gets the sense that it really
is. Classic jazz cassettes play jaun-
tily in the background as custom-
ers stand enveloped by wall-to-wall
books. Mysteries of all kinds are
piled chockablock on the shelves.
Partially inspired by Uncle
Edgar's Mystery Bookstore in Min-
neapolis, Jamie and Robin Agnew
drew on their mutual love of books
and mysteries to open up a kind of
sister store in Ann Arbor. As a great
book town, Ann Arbor seemed a
good fit for Aunt Agatha's Mystery
Bookstore. Playing off of Agatha
Christie's unofficial title as The
Queen of Crime, the bookstore has
an "Agatha" movie poster over the
front desk and an avatar of a woman
with a handbag and a dagger in the
window. The sounds of Louis Arm-
strong, Duke Ellington and hits
from the '20s and '30s emanate
from a cassette player to evoke the
golden age of detective fiction.
As a niche bookstore, Aunt
Agatha's has books belonging to
almost every mystery subgenre.
From noir to true crime, thrillers
to all-American cozy mysteries, the
bookshop has everything a who-
dunit enthusiast might want.
"We try and keep the definition
as broad as possible as to what a

mystery is," Agnew said. "I mean,
we have spy books, we have sus-
pense books, we have murder
books. We're not in the business
of excluding people - we're in the
business of including people."
As one of the only mystery book-
stores in Michigan, Aunt Agatha's
is sometimes burdened with piles
of donated mysteries. The books
seem to be overflowing off the pur-
ple bookshelves. Serving as a sta-
tion for people to leave their most
beloved mysteries, Aunt Agatha's
is full of amateur gumshoes' old
treasures. If you're lucky, you
might even find a thriller peppered
with the notes of a reader from
long ago.
Specializing in a genre like this
helps ensure that, despite all
the competition from online
retailers, other local stores and
the library (the main competi-
tion in today's lean times), Aunt
Agatha's still has unusual items
that Borders can't offer. Agatha's
also sells mystery novelties of
other forms like puzzles, games
and themed greeting cards. The
bookstore has even been focus-
ing on events, likebook signings,
to keep up with the rest of the
book-world.
"Book business is becoming
isore and more event-driven,
and so we've gotten on that
bandwagon," Agnew said. "We
start out with authors when
they're relatively unknown and
then hopefully they continue
coming here when they become
better known. We have a good
reputation in the mystery com-
munity of having a good book
signing and good customers so a
lot of people who are starting off
come here."

Author autographs adorn the
walls of the bookshop. Local writ-
ers like Loren D. Estleman and
Steve Hamilton come in for sign-
ings often along with other mys-
tery novelists. The shop has two to
three events a month, with signings
by Estleman and Hamilton coning
up in the next few months. This
Sunday, authors Sharon Fiffer and
Libby Fischer Hellmann will be
coming to the store to sign their
new books as well.
But this quirky Ann Arbor sta-
ple seems to be unknown to many
people, especially locals who don't
realize what's right around the
corner.
"We're unique," Agnew said.
"We're the only mystery store in
Michigan and people from out of
town always come in here and their
eyes bug out. If their kid is going
to the 'U,' every time they come to
visit they come here and they love
it. But people from town kind of

take us for granted:"
As much as it's fun to imagine,
there's no typical mystery book-
store patron. But undergraduate
students rarely take the time to stop
in the store, accordingto Agnew.
"To me, you have to have a cer-
tain maturity to enjoy mysteries,"
Agnew said. "They're about life and
moral decisions and real people in
the real world. We get grad stu-
dents, we get professors. A lot of
women read mysteries, but it's defi-
nitely an older crowd."
But perhaps the most charming
thing about Aunt Agatha's Mystery
Bookstore is the enthusiasm of the
people who work there and their
extensive knowledge of the genre.
The evidence is covering the walls.
"You can go into Borders and it's
like any other Borders in the world,
but you go in here and it's like noth-
ing else," Agnew said. "Whether
that's good orbad, I don'tknow."
Bad it certainly is not.

store) doesn't feel like it's some-
thing that's really hitting home
to me, because of the convenience
and the quickness and the accu-
racy you can get online."
"I don't really have that nos-
talgia of going to a record store
and being really pumped about
a release that's coming out in
the way that our parents or older
siblings might have felt," Leahy
admits.
Marc Taras of PJ's validates this
generational gap, explaining how
his core demographic has shifted
in the past 15 years from 25-and-
younger to 25-and-older.
While these stores are remark-
ably staying afloat, the general
engulfment of culture by the
Internet is increasingly pigeonhol-
ing them in a niche market. And
the fan base for this market may
be dying - literally.
THE DEATH OF THE CD
When it comes down to it, the
root of the problem lies in the fact
that the CD, the former bread and
butter of most record stores, has
become financially inviable com-
pared to the MP3.
"If you spend $1,000 pressing
a CD, you have to sell 100 of them
at $10 before there's even a dollar
actually made," says Al McWil-
liams, CEO of Quack!Media, an
independent multimedia distribu-
tor in Ann Arbor.
On the other hand, you don't
have to pay up-front costs to pro-
duce an MP3.
"With digital, you have to make
one penny to profit," McWilliams
explains.
While record labels haven't
stopped selling CDs just yet, sales
figures might give them incentive
to go totally digital. According to
eMpyre ramireX, the pseudonym-
masked president of Galactic
Dust, a Detroit-based indepen-
dent record label, for every $45
he makes on MP3 sales, he only
makes about $5 on physical CDs.
So why do these companies
continue to sell CDs? Well, mainly
because certain people keep buy-
ing them - there's a sort of CD

fetish inherent in bona fide music
nerds.
Brian Peters of Ghostly Interna-
tional, an independent Ann Arbor
music label, discusses the com-
pulsive tendency of hardcore
audiophiles to "want the tac-
tile sense of holdingthe LP:
seeing the art, having that
ownership over the prod-
uct and that connection
to the band."
And, of course,
there's the issue of
sound quality.
"The amount of
quality information
- audio bits - that
are on a CD is just such
a higher sampling rate
than what's on (the
usual) MP3," explains
Mark Clague, assistant
professor of Musicology
at the University.
Bradish of Underground Sounds
speculates that "people who are
buying a CD or an LP have usually
heard it and know what they're
getting into and are making an
investment in sound quality."
As far as MP3s, Bradish
is turned off: "It always
comes off flat and com-
pressed and tinny.
There's absolutely
no room sound ...
most vinyl, if
it's mastered r W
correctly ...
you can c
actually
get a
feel
for
the
room it
was record-
ed in."
Luckily for these record stores,
audiophiles have shown a rekin-
dled appreciation for the subtle-
ties of acoustic fidelity. While CD
sales are plummeting, sales in
vinyl have enjoyed an unexpected
resurgence, and local record stores
have capitalized on this trend to
stay alive.
"We sell a lot of CDs, but they
just pay forthe rentbasically," says
Dale. "We make our money off of
(vinyl)."
While the CD market may be
drying up significantly, the true
music fan's unrelenting passion for

local music from the past ump-
teen years. Encore, Wazoo and
Underground Sounds all
carry extensive collections
of local releases. And
they do it on an essen-
tially non-profit basis,
marking up the CDs
just enough to cover stock-
ing costs.
Butmostimportantly,AnnArbor
record stores actively spread the
love for local artists. Leah Diehl of
the band Lightning Love mentions
how Bradish fervently pro-
moted her music, hooking
her band up with a show in
Ohio and selling her album
to people who had never
even heard of the group.
And while Google may be
cheapening the value of a record
store owner's musical expertise by
placing all of that knowledge and'
more within the easy-access reach
of a search engine, there's a human
element inherent in record stores
that will never be displaced by the
Information Age.
Peters of Ghostly International
talks about the sort of invaluable
relationship that a consumer can
build with a record store owner.
"Matt Bradish at Underground
Sounds is really good about bring-
ing in specialty discs. I got the My
Bloody Valentine reissue EPson
vinyl. And he knew, the second I
walked in he knew I'd want it,"
Peters said. "He knows me. I know
him. And there's just that great
sense of curation that I think you
don'tget at Best Buy."
And Clague mentions how, while
the Internet has revolutionized the
spread of culture and information,
it "has a way of sort of atom-
izing everything to make
it almost invisible."
There's a cer-
tain preciousness
to witnessing
all of these

musical trinkets huddled together
under one roof, a preciousness that
evaporates when this information
is relegated to Web pages.
"There's something about walk-
ing into Encore, in a-space where
the titles are almost falling down
because the stacks are so high,"
Clague says. "And you get a vis-
ceral sense, a physical sense, .a
psychic sense of the kind of legacy
and amount of art that's been cre-
ated that there is to grasp ... If you
just started at one end and tried to
listen your way through the store,
you'd die before you made it 10 feet
past the front entrance."
Perhaps more than anything,
local record stores are refreshing
slices of reality in a world that's
been increasingly digitized. While
they may be quaint, local record
stores are a crucial component of
Ann Arbor's cultural vibrancy as a
sort of embassy where audiophiles
can converge instead of walking
around, severed from the out-
side world by their iPod earbuds.
And while the stores may be on or
near their deathbeds, they're still
around for now.
"We can't take our whole life
and put it online. There has to be
somethingyou can walk out of your
house and actually do," McWil-
liams of Quack!Media says. "I have
a special appreciation for record
stores but I also have a general of
appreciation for real life
and leaving the house
sometimes. I met
girls in record
stores."

LOCAL RECORD STORES:
KEEPING REALITY REAL
So what is it thatwe would all be

stores just decided to up and leave?
According to the major players in
the Ann Arbor music scene: alot.
For one, record stores are help-
ing to keep downtown Ann Arbor
culturally alive ina time when real
estate is becoming increasingly

smothered by mass-produced
chain stores.
Bradish is particularly vehe-

got to realize, what do they want?
Do they want corporate control of
everything? If so, keep buying on

'DIDDY KONG RACING' (1997) N64

ario Kart's multiplayer superior

By JACK PORTER
Daily Arts Writer
"Mario Kart 64" was the video
game that defined the kart racing
genre, inspiring a legion of knock-
offs in its wake. The kart fad,
though short-lived, produced a few
stellar games.
While "Mario Kart 64" still had
the best multiplayer, itssingle-play-
er modes were shamedby the Story
Mode in "Diddy Kong Racing," a
game that has been sorely over-
looked. "Diddy Kong" offered more
than just a vanilla racing package
- the extra plane and hovercraft
vehicles, item-collecting challeng-
es and boss battlesbrought new life
to the format. Best of all, the wick-
ed track designs and devilish diffi-
culty ensured the game's longevity.
At first glance, "Diddy Kong
Racing" appears infantile and its
cast of colorful cartoon animals
with squeaky, child-like voices
can grate on the nerves. The plot is
also woefully vapid, meaning Story
Mode fails to live up to its name.
Taj, a thickly Indian-accented blue
elephant wearing a turban (really)

summons Diddy Kong and his
friends (some of whom later star
in their own games, like Banjo and
Conker) to save their island para-
dise from Wizpig, an evil porcine
wizard. The plot is really just a silly
contrivance to provide grounds for
the platforming and adventure ele-
ments interspersed into the racing
gameplay.
Another distinctive quirk is the
game's focus on collecting objects,
from golden balloons to silver coins
and amulet pieces. The golden bal-
The Clinton era's
finest kart game.
loons are garnered through racing
victories and found while explor-
ing the game's island overworld.
Silver coins are snagged during
specialraces, and amulet pieces are
collected after besting each world's
boss in two races.
The collecting aspect works
because the sense of incremental
accomplishment is addicting, as

countless other games have proven.
Rare, the game's developer, is a
master of the collect-a-thon ("Don-
key Kong Country" was its break-
out title), so this idea was a natural
fit. In the end, Rare should've made
more racers.
As an oddball racer, "DiddyKong
Racing" shines when it comes time
to put the joystick to the plastic.
Courses are filled with daunting
hairpin turns, steep drops, speed-
boosting strips and shortcuts. By
crafting clever alternate paths,
Rare endowed the game with sur-
prising depth.
During .the Silver Coin Chal-
lenges, the player mustcollect eight
hidden coins throughout the track
within three laps and still manage
to finish first. To ensure victorythe
player has to learn the intricacies
of courses like the pirate-themed
Treasure Cove, which has at least
three shortcuts. This brings a stra-
tegic element to the racer, as the
player needs to plotout fast and safe
routes to the coins. If this demand
for precision sounds masochistic,
well, maybe it is. "Diddy Kong Rac-
ing" is not for the faint of heart, and
the bosses are proof of that as well.
The boss races appear simple
enough in theory: The goal is to
finish first against the boss while
he attempts to squash or other-
wise sabotage the player. But as
the game progresses, the difficulty
skyrockets. Most notorious among
the bosses is the third level's octo-
pus, which veteran players unof-
ficially refer to as "that fucking
octopus."
Inthe race, the player.must con-
trol the hovercraft (which has the
most fickle handling of any vehi-
cle) while dodgingerrant logs and
giant bubbles, which the octopus
lays as traps -one mistake and the
raceis effectivelyover. Butaswith
any well-designed video game, the
profanity-spewing player will still
want to give it"just one more go."
Despite its cheery, candy-coat-
ed exterior, "Diddy Kong Racing"
delivers a challengingsingle-play-
er mode with considerable depth.
The "Mario Kart" series is a blast
with friends, but none of those
titles can provide such a lengthy,
rewarding solo quest. Any fans of
unrealistic racers should pick up
"Diddy Kong Racing" and expe-
rience the controller-chucking
magic that has endeared gamers
to"thatfuckingoctopus"sincethe
