CAMPUS LIFE
Play to raise
awareness of
sexual assault

Performance to
work with campaign
to prevent assault
on college campuses
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
In light of an increased
nationwide focus on preventing
sexual assault on college
campuses, the University's School
of Music, Theatre & Dance will
premiere Naomi Iizuka's new
play, "Good Kids." The production
will be in conjunction with the
University's broader Expect
Respect: Flip the Script sexual
assault prevention campaign -
which itself is a part of the Big Ten
Theatre Consortium's New Play
Initiative.
The performance will play
during the first two weekends
of October at the North Campus
Arthur Miller Theatre.
The Big Ten Theatre

Consortium will put on the play
at all Big Ten schools in an effort
to address the issue of most plays
being predominantly male centric.
According to Assistant Theatre
Prof. Gillian Eaton, the show's
director, the Music, Theatre &
Dance School in its history have
only performed nine plays written
by women.
"There just aren't that many
plays by women, for women, with
big parts for women and about
women's issues," Eaton said.
"That's why this consortium was
put together."
The Expect Respect: Flip the
Script initiative will address
sexual assault prevention on
campus. In addition to the play, the
initiative willinclude a widespread
social media campaign to get the
message out. All students and
faculty involved in the play will
receive sexual assault bystander
intervention and sexual assault
prevention training through
the University's Sexual Assault
Prevention and Awareness Center.

A panel of seven Univer-

86-page report analyzing the
1967 Detroit Race Riot in which
police raided an unlicensed
bar and sparked violence with
patrons and other locals.
The debacle got so out ofhand
that Michigan Governor George
Romney enlisted the help of the
National Guard to restore order.
These forces were ultimately
bolstered by paratroopers, per
the orders of President Lyndon

"Some of the biggest fans did
not go to Michigan," he said.
"Some of the biggest donors didn't
go to Michigan. It's an amazing
expression of our values."
He argued football is one of the
University's most important com-
mon threadsbetween all students,
adding that game day is perhaps
one of the most complete reflec-
tions ofstudent life.
"When you take a seat (in
Michigan Stadium), we don't care
about your race, ethnicity, nation-
ality, your age, gender, econom-
ics," Bacon said."Allwe care about
is, when the band gets to 'Hail,'
you're going to jam your fist in the
air. Do that at the right time, you
are one of us."
Bacon stressed that both in and
outside of the University Athletic
Department, the main goal to
strive for in the University setting
is moral steadiness. He said an
icon like former Michigan football
coach Bo Schembechler, who led
the program between 1969 and
1989, embodied this goal - and
that students who weren't even
born when Schembechler retired
still knew his name and remem-
bered him as a leader, not neces-
sarily as a football coach.
"That, to me, is the Michigan
Difference," Bacon said. "We want
to win, we expect to win, but the
truth matters to us. If you have a
chance to pursue the truth and
you fail to do so, you have not only
lost your personal integrity, you
have not only lost your personal;

lost your soul. This entire Univer-

that's the truth."

Following a study abroad in northwestern India, LSA senior Kim Deering participates in Langar on the Diag Friday.
Students host event inspired
by study abroad experience

Sikh Student
Association says
langar tradition
poorly represented
By TANYA MADHANI
For the Daily
Amid the rushing of students,
voter registration representa-
tives and the odd firebrand
preacher, 13 students stood on
the Diag Friday with baskets
of food to bring a piece of their
study abroad in India back to
Ann Arbor - but not without a
bit of controversy.
Over the summer, these stu-
dents worked on a GIEU pro-
gram in Amritsar, India, where
they participated in langar
events at the Golden Temple -
a historic Sikh religious site and
one of India's most noted land-
marks. Traditionally, a langar is
a meal served at the end of a wor-
ship ceremony and emphasizes
equality between participants
regardless of their social class,
status or religious beliefs, LSA
junior Andrew Vu, one of the
event participants, said.
While abroad, the students,
Alearned how organizers at the
Golden Temple feed -around

60,000 people per day in the
complex'slangarhalls - adaunt-
ing economic and logistical task,
to say the least. Back in Ann
Arbor, the participants settled
on a more modest goal.
"We're trying to recreate that
on a much smaller scale," LSA
senior Jenny Chuang said. "So
now we have a 100,000 people
but I think we made up to 3,000
wraps."
The students, all undergradu-
ates, were involved in every
aspect of the preparation: buying
produce, cutting the food, cook-
ing it, serving it and eating it.
Chuang said she hoped the
event encouraged people to look
beyond just the free food and
instead think about how they
could work to help others.
"We treat people differently
depending on where we see
them, but we really shouldn't,"
Chuang said. "It takes seeing an
example to really cement that in
instead of theoretically thinking
that. For the average person that
walks through the Diag I hope
they ask'Why are you guys here?
What's been going on?' and kind
of learn what we were able to
learn from the Golden Temple."
The wraps served on the Diag
riday were completely veg-
etarian, with ingredients such
as chickpeas, cabbage and mint
A

chutney. Langar food in the
Golden Temple and other Sikh
temples is generally vegetarian.
"A lot of people think being
vegetarian is extremely limit-
ing," Vu. said. "It's not true....
Once they know that it's vegetar-
ian and that it's filling and it's
nutritional, maybe they'll have a
different perspective on things."
The trip was chaperoned by
Engineering Prof. Jasprit Singh
and his wife from June 4 to July
4. Singh said a langar meal is pre-
pared to break down barriers,
which he hoped would do the
same at the University.
"The challenge we face glob-
ally is not that people don't have
food, it's that we have barriers,"
Singh said. "That people don't
have opportunities to expand
their horizon, so many barriers
are inthe way. This eventis away
to gently work on bringing peo-
ple together so they realize that
people who are different from
each other are still the same. So
food is the ideal way. The event is
to build a community and food is
a medium to do that."
The wraps were made with
help from more than iS volunteers
at the kitchen of the Plymouth
Gurdwara Sahib, a Sikh temple
about 20 miles from Ann Arbor.
Vu said the week of preparation

by the University's Board of
Regents.
In a brief question and answer
session followinghis presentation,
he expanded upon this point.
"To me, the biggest scandal in
college football is greed ... greed
is going to kill college sports as
we know them," he said. "This
is a nonprofit, state university.
Nobody here gets market value.
Nobody here gets to return an
investment. You don't come to a
big university to cashin."
LSA sophomore Steven Ober-
lander said he liked the pre-
sentation particularly as an
out-of-state student without
as much background on Ann
Arbor's early years.
"I thought it was amazing,"
Oberlander said. "He's definitely

passionate. It was just interest-
ing to hear a lot about the his-
tory ... also, his perspective on
campus life and how this really
is, in his mind, the greatest place
in the world."
Katherine Britton - the
mother of LSA freshman Mat-
thew Britton, a new Honors
student - and her husband Ed
attended the event with their
son. Mrs.Britton said the lecture
attuned her to the fascinating,
intellectual avenues to pursue
within the Honors Program.
"The mix of academics and
football is, in fact, one of the
hallmarks of Michigan, and it's
sort of fascinating that that's
the topic that was chosen for
the parents," she said. "In some
ways, it's interesting in the Big
Ten how football is kind of this
unifying factor in a way that it
isn't in many ofthe other confer-
ences, and he certainly brought
that out, which is part of the
Michigan ethos."

after assessing student demand
via survey. The results of the ini-
tial survey from February 2013
indicated that over 75 percent of
possible riders - students, faculty,
1 staff and community members -
were 'very likely' to use the ser-
vice if it were provided.
In its trial year, the Connector
fulfilled that demand: approxi-
mately 150 people travelled from
Ann Arbor on the Connector per
week in the fall and winter, and
100 per week in the spring and
summer months. Since its launch
in October 2013, there have been
approximately 6,000 rider trips
out of Ann Arbor.
Rackham student Carolyn
Lusch was hired on as the Trans-

helped shape the Connector into
its current form.
"We set up a very rudimentary
system for making reservations at
first," Lusch said. "It was literally
just a Google doc that I checked
every day so that we would know
who was riding."
The reservation system is now
a little more involved - a website
through the University where
students can visit to see all the
available dates and times that the
connector is running, reserve a
seat and check out events that are
taking place downtown.
The service is primarily for
Mcard holders but students and
faculty are allowed four guests
per day. The reservation serves

New York native, Shipper lived in
Ann Arbor for a while but found
he missed living in an urban
environment.
"To be near such a major city
and to not partake in it felt weird,
in some way," Shipper said. "To
claim that I was close to Detroit
but to not actually be a part of it
felt weird. I just feel more at home
in a city."
Because this is its first year
being funded by the University,
the Detroit Connector team's main
goal is to keep growing ridership.
They are targeting University
groups and classes that may want
to take cultural field trips to the
city. Since the Connector begassits
service, approximately 60 student
groups have used the Connector.
"There isn't a quota that we
need to maintain, per se," Lusch

said, "but we have been told
by the University that they are
monitoring it. So anyone who has
ever considered riding it, ride it."
If demand becomes great
enough, they would consider
adding more stops to the route
in Ann Arbor and in Detroit.
Currently, the bus runs Thursday
through Sunday at various times
throughout the day. It begins its
route at the University of Michigan
Detroit Center on Woodward
Avenue, makes another stop
behind the Detroit Institute of
Arts, then heads to Ann Arbor,
stopping at C.C. Little. On the way
to Detroit, students drive through
the heart of downtown, stopping
at the Renaissance Center before
heading back to the Detroit Center
to begin the route again.
Though Detroit is mostly a
driving city, the stops available
provide access to key areas of
cultural interest. Cafes, bars,
restaurants and other attractions
are within walking distance of
the three stops. Employees at the
Detroit Center have information
regarding bike rentals and the
Detroit public bus system to
explore less central destinations.
In an effort to make the
Connector less intimidating to
students who aren't used to public
transit, Lusch launched Transit
Tuesdays, a weekly meeting
in Ann Arbor in the Michigan
League. Lusch goes and sits at
a table marked with the Detroit
Center sign, and is available
for questions and comments
regarding the service.
"The future of this project
depends on the riders," LuschF
said, "And our showing that the
service is being used alot."

was a serious time commit-
ment.
However, many students
expressed concern with how
the event was promoted and
organized. LSA junior Mea-
gan Shokar, public relations
chair for the Sikh Students
Association, said in an e-mail
interview the SSA was disap-
pointed by how the event was

conducted.
"Most of all we are dis-
appointed in the manner in
which GIEU chose to ... adver-
tise the event simply as a 'free
lunch,' " Shokar said. "Langar
is a holy concept ingrained in
the faith of Sikhs, yet Sikh-
ism was not mentioned on the
Facebook event or on the flyers
for the event. At the very least,
it would have been very ben-
eficial to give out educational
materials to those who picked
up the meal."
Langar on the Diag did not

have people sitting together
and, Shokar said she. did not
know what the event was actu-
ally about.
"The purpose of Langar is
to have members of a diverse
community come together and
eat, side-by-side, regardless of
their backgrounds or own reli-
gious beliefs," Shokar wrote.
"The word 'langar' is special to
Sikhs all across the globe, and
to accurately portray its mean-
ing on a campus where there
is already little awareness of
Sikhism is absolutely vital."


ASSAULT
From Page 1A
The play, "Good Kids,"
addresses the themes of rape and
hookup culture among young
adults. The play is based on the
2012 Steubenville High School
rape case, where the sexual
assault of a teenage girl by two
members of the high school foot-
ball team was heavily publicized
through pictures and videos
posted on social media.
After each performance,
speakers will answer questions
from the audience and address
various aspects of the topic. Dr.
Christopher Kilmartin, a stand-
up comedian and international-

ly-recognized expert on violence
prevention and gender, will be
one of the speakers.
"We want to set the bar high,"
Eaton said. "That's why we came
up with this outreach initiative
regarding the rape and respect
culture. We wanted the play to
have a larger impact and have
a piece of creative work be the
impetus to start a change of
heart and a change of mind about
the subject."
The play is intended to launch
a campus-wide conversation
about community responsibili-
ftes and individual choices in
regards to preventing sexual
assault and harm to others.
SAPAC Director Holly Rider-
Milkovich said that in light of the

White House's new campaign,
It's On Us, which asks colleges
and individuals to take on the
issue of ending sexual assault,
the initiative is an opportune
way to spread the play's message
on campus.
"Sexual violence prevention
is something we need to work
on constantly," Rider-Milkovich
said. "We want to support stu-
dent activism and encourage and
help guide student voices on this
issue to the extent that students
continue to really find value and
meaning and vigor in this proj-
ect. We will continue to support
it and we will also support new
ideas and new projects because
certainly there is a lot of work to
be done."

Lauri Hansen addressed the
emphasis on human spaceflight
and their latest project, the Aster-
oid Redirect Mission, which aims
to artificially redirect an asteroid
into the moon's orbit in order to
study its properties. The mission
gained attention in the aerospace
community, as they are hoping it
will be a stepping-stone to more
involved human missions into
deep space.
The panels not only provided
information on the work being
done in the industry currently,
but they also stressed the impor-
tance of student involvement and
the role of our generation in aero-
space.
Frank DeMauro, vice president
at Orbital Sciences Corporation,
which focuses on development
and launch of satellites and rock-
ets, spoke about giving commer-
cial access to space and their new

spacecraft, Cygnus, which could
provide new opportunities for
travel into deep space.
"I'm very excited about the
caliber of students that come from
our colleges," DeMauro said when
asked about the education stu-
dents are receiving at universities.
Students attending the panel
were able to see how all the dif-
ferent parts of the industry, from
engineering to marketing, worked
together to achieve a common
goal.
Engineering senior Jose
Gomez, after attending the panel
on space travel, said he realized
"The common consensus (among
the panelists) is that it is the stu-
dentstoday that are going to really
make the difference and really
push our species beyond Earth-
orbit and into space.
"I feel a little bit more empow-
ered now," he said.

EVACUATION
From Page 1A
There are three weather-
mapping systems that track
dangerous weather systems,
Piersante said. One is in the
emergency operations center on
game day, another is located in
the separate DPSS operations
center and the last is monitored
by the athletic department.
Piersante said he knew there
would be a high chance of
bad weather during the game
and noted that information
was communicated to fans in

advance of the storm on the
scoreboard.
Once a lightning strike was
detected, fans were asked
to evacuate. Piersante said
he thought the process went
smoothly and that it was not
chaotic.
"There was no panic at all that
I observed," he said. "Perhaps
because we did put the warning
out, I think a lot of people were
prepared."
' Kinesiology sophomore Casey
Aman said that people were
more frantic than usual because
it was raining heavily and there
was lightning, but that most

people had left by the time the
storm began because the team
was losing badly.
LSA sophomore Joe Shea said
he observed some disturbances
in the crowd, including some
students who were worried
about lightning striking the
metal seating.
"I think it was a little chaotic
just because ifyou look at how the
Big House is set up, there really is
only that one entrance," he said.
"You enter the stadium, and you
go to your seats - you start at
row 70 and you walk all the way
down. It doesn't feel extremely
conducive for evacuations."

"They've agreed to reverse the
policy and also to work with the
Union to monitor safety at the
Wall St. structure in case employ-
ees do want to continue parking
there," Kettinger said.
Although Kettinger was glad
the University showed concern
for the nurses' safety, she said
the plan should never have been
enacted in the first place. She
claimed UMHS did not consult
with any nurses in creating the
plan and said the change seemed
unnecessary since the closer
parking lot usually has plenty of
parking at night.
"This plan was just thrown at
everybody with no notice and no
inclusion, and no discussion with
nurses and other employees who
would be affected by it," Ket-
tinger said. "This really shouldn't
have happened."
Nurses had the option of pay-

ing $531 more for a Blue parking
pass, which would allow them to
park in a closer lot. Previously, the
cheaper Yellow pass would allow
staff to park in the closer lot.
Thursday, WXYZ Detroit
reported 300 nurses had paid
for the upgraded passes, but that
they would have the option of
changing back to a Yellow pass
with this newest policy reversal.
This is not the first time the
Wall Street structure, which
opened July 7, has been the topic
of controversy. Originally pro-
posed by UMHS during their
2005 expansion, it has faced
criticism from local residents and
Ann Arbor City Councilmembers.
UMHS lead public relations
representative Kara Gavin could
not be reached for comment at the
time of publication.

CATHERINE BERGIN I \I WPIN
Does Greek Life uphold its values?

Hemophobia

"So, how has your Greek Life chapter been
helping out the greater community lately?"
I overheard a fraternity member asking my
sorority sister at a mixer. Just kidding, nobody
asked that. Truth be told, I didn't join a
sorority to help my GPA, play with rescue
dogs or to wash cars in the name of disease
research. I joined because I knew it would be
fu. I wold eet friends. I would have things
to do on the weekends and have parties to go to
whenever I wanted.
I'll admit, the "Michigan Greek Life
Strategic Plan" is a little dramatic. While I
agree that it "enhances the undergraduate
experience for its members," I would disagree
that Greek Life is "the best possible reflection
of the University" or that its members "truly
live the values upon which our historic
organizations were founded" (I'm pretty sure
head-butting walls until they have significant
holes in them is not one of these values). If
Greek Life members were polled on what
these actual "values" are, I'm sure many would
reply with blank stares, "What?" or "No idea."
This is not to say that fraternity and sorority
members are disinterested, dumb or clueless,
but perhaps that these individual organizations
and chapters are not doing their part to uphold
the principles on which they were founded
or instilling these values into their members.
I'm taking a closer look at a few of Michigan's
"Greek Life Strategic Goals and Objectives" to
see how closely our community is (or is not)
honoringthem.
1. "Promote congruence and alignment
of actions with our organizations'values."
It's no wonder that "each year thousands
of young women and men seek membership
in sororities and fraternities on college
campuses throughout the United States
and Canada." These organizations are
famous for their "legendary commitments to
friendship, sisterhood, brotherhood and
loyalty," All aspects that I have undeniably
experienced - the "brotherhood" aspect still
pending. I have become incredibly close with
my sorority as a whole, and feel almost like
family with many. What I feel more distant
from, however, is the "expectation to uphold
the ritual, values, mission and aims of the
respective organization." In fact, I really have
no idea what my sorority's mission is. I just
know that Iam part of a sororitythat has many
girlsothat are outgoing, fun, kind and outspoken.
Michigan Greek Life's "shared values within
our community include service, leadership,
scholarship, friendship, respect, human dignity
and a lifelong commitment to the organiza-
tion." Service is certainly stressed throughout
my chapter and Greek Life as a whole on Michi-
gan's campus. Most sorority events can only
be attended by members who have fulfilled
the mandatory community service hours, usu-
ally six a semester. We receive weekly e-mails
from our community service chair listing
upcoming service opportunities, as well as
other ways to get involved with the larger
community as a whole. Sororities and fraterni-
ties on campus often support each other's ini-
tiatives by attending respective events in the
name of fundraising, such as a dinner held at
a sorority house or a carwash at a fraternity -
how clean the cars actually get, I don't know.
The "friendship," "sisterhood" and "lifelong
commitment" that Greek Life helps facilitate
was accurately encapsulated when a senior
memberof my sorority foresaw that,because of
her membership, she will have "way too many
bridesmaids."
It is required "that members whose actions
are not aligned with the organization's
expectations are held accountable to change
or face dismissal," and I, as well as many of my
sisters, can attest to this first hand. Whether
it is overconsumption of alcohol, acting out of
line in anyway or irresponsible behavior, the
punishment is always the same: the basement.
Once there, a council goes over the situation
you are being held for and works to find the
cause of it, as well as a punishment based on
its severity. Whether it is issuing an apology,
writing a reflection paper, or increasing
service hours, the system usually reaches its
goal, to not have repeat offenders. I, for one,
would not like to go to the basementcagain. Ever.

2. "Encourage chapters to develop
and maintain a healthy status and healthy
relationships."

In terms of being a "healthy chapter," one
that is "well rounded, vibrant, active and
contributes to the community and the fraternity
and sorority experience at Michigan," mine
is in fighting shape. in my pledge class alone,
nine girls are in the Business school, and as a
chapter, we have 20 girls in the nursing school.
We have neuroscience majors, communication
majors, girls in the school of dentistry, pre-
med and pre-law students and everything in
between. We have girls on the dance team,
girls on the rowing team, girls who write for
The Michigan Daily as well members of the
Panhellenic Association. We aren't alone,
however. Sororities and fraternities across the
board have pledge classes just as diverse and
ambitious as mine. We are also active (and not
just because I come downstairs every morning
to see girls doing ab exercises after they come
back from running together, ugh). Our chapter
won Greek Week last year, a competition among
chapterstoshowtheirspirit(ugh,again,Iknow).
Though I only directly participated in the limbo
competition (seriously), I, as well as nearly all of
our members, were there to cheer on the dance
team and singing group as they performed for
the Greek community (somethingtells me that
Mitch McGary and Shane Morris judging the
competition had something to do with the high
attendance rate).
In terms of ensuring "that each chapter is
supported and has access to the advising and
resources it needs to be successful and grow,"
Michigan Greek Life is upholding its end of
the deal. Throughout our recruitment process,
we had the help of a national member of our
sorority who specializes in recruitment and
assistingchapters in findingthe right procedure
for them. Having her in our house made it
a much more professional, organized and
overall improved experience.
As evidence for how vocal of a sorority I
belong to, my chapter promotes "ideals of
responsibility and citizenship," with members
who "feel empowered to intervene and create
change in the best interest of individuals and
the chapter as a whole." This was exemplified
when, just last night, a member stood up
in a chapter meeting when she didn't feel
comfortable with the language being using
when referring to a certain group of people.
And guess what? The people who used that
language immediately apologized, and the
words in question weren't used again.
If you were wondering, I came in second
place in the limbo competition. Looking to
place firstcthis year.
4. "Empower our community to be the
'Leaders and Best' through clearly defined
standards and community expectations."
In terms of "establishing our community
as a safe and welcoming space for all students
where actions demonstrate respect for all,"
Greek Life has its work cut out for it. Take
the "I'm Shmacked: University of Michigan
- Welcome Week" video for example. In
her response piece "We're All Schmucked,"
former Daily columnist Melanie Kruvelis
asserts "everyone has lost faith in humanity.
They are horrified, they are embarrassed and
nobody can stop watching." Whatand who were
they watching? Mainly Michigan Greek Life.
Some may argue that Greek life looks especially
out of control when appearing in a 3:57 video
that is designed to make it look exactly that, or
that it was "just edited that way," but anybody
who'has been inAnn Arbor on a football
Saturday knows that it's the reality. Perhaps this
doesn't paint the most pleasant "image of their
community" and tailgating students probably
aren't pondering how "their actions and
methods of governance impact Greek Life and
the University of Michigan," but undoubtedly,
they do. This, and similar depictions of
Greek Life don't necessarily demonstrate a.
community that "functions at the highest
possible level of integrity and accountability,"
and can serve asa convincing argument against
Greek Life's "self-governance."
Though Greek Life is not a consistent role
model for those lookingto "conductithemselves
with integrity and in accordance with sound
values," no organization is. Take capitalism, for
example.
I'll spare you, but you get the idea.

Catherine Bergin is an LSA sophomore.

few weeks back, as I was
contemplating how to
supplement my income
by means
other than
waiting tables,
a potentially
lucrative option
dawned on me:
plasma donation.:
I couldn't
believe I hadn't AUSTIN
considered it DAVIS
earlier. Plenty of
my friends had
already shared
anecdotes of their pilgrimages to
the Octapharma Plasma Donation
Center directly off of I-94 in
Ypsilanti, a company whose name
elicits body-harvesting scenes from
"The Matrix." Plasma donation
was plugged as a good cause that
resulted in easy cash flow without
any strings or taxes attached, and I
was sold on the idea.
It became screamingly obvious
upon entering the center on a
Saturday afternoon that I wasn't
the only person in the greater Ann
Arbor area with these considerations
about plasma donation. The line was
formidable and slow moving, stacked
full with people who had decided that
moonlighting at Octapharma would
be more profitable than an average
shift at their day job. It also became
obvious upon prolonged observation
that most of the people with whom
I was sharing my afternoon very
clearly did not share my lifestyle.
Most faces were weathered from
hardship, leathered from extended
sun exposure or cracked from days
of prolonged worry. More than a few
had yellowed fingers and eyes from
years of nicotine use; more than a
few twitched and had scars from
trying to itch away withdrawal.
Considering that the Red Cross is
about 40,000 units of blood behind
daily quotas, it became apparent
that all veins were being tapped,
regardless of what had previously
been flowing through them.
I was right in assuming that my
lifestyle was different from all other

would-be donors. Despite all other
indicators of health, one aspect of my
lifestyle earned me somethingtheirs
didn't: a lifetime ban from donating.
Apparently, having fag running
through your veins is where they
draw the line.
Admittedly, the FDA's 1983 imple-
mentation of the ban barring men
who have sex with men (MSM) from
donating blood was at the time a logi-
cal, albeit harsh step in attemptingto
control the spread of the HIV virus.
Screening practices at the time were
inefficient and inaccurate due to the
dormant nature of the virus, and
gay and bisexual men are infected
in overwhelmingly disproportion-
ate numbers in comparison to other
high-risk groups, such as intravenous
drug users. Even today, after decades
of campaigns

the HIV virus from nine to 11 days
after infection, and the chances that
HIV-infected blood is inadvertently
used in a viable transfusion is one
in 6.5 million. The Red Cross openly
disdainstheban,sayingthatalthough
it will continue to implement the
FDA's policies, they will "support the
use of rational, scientifically-based
deferral periods that are applied
fairly and consistently among donors
who engage insimilar risk activities."
If administrators of the ban imply
that the current practices against
MSM are unfair and inconsistent,
why then is this discriminatory and
scientifically debunked policy still
being implemented? The only logical
reason I can think of is fear. Not that
a healthy host will become infected,
but rather the FDA - now presented
with current

traception and

increased by 12 percent amongst gay
and bisexual men between 2008 and
2010. If infected blood were to be
transfused into an uninfected host,
the results could be physically and
psychologically devastating. Fear
of this worst-case scenario drove
the FDA to do what they believed
was necessary to protect the major-
ity, which effectually type-casted an
already subjugated and discriminat-
ed minority as already infected.
Amidst new technological
advances in HIV and other STI
and infectious disease screenings,
however, the reasoning behind the
ban on MSM who have engaged in
sexual activity since 1977 has become
moot.lldonatedblood,regardlessof
the status of its donor, is mandatorily
tested for any bloodborne pathogens.
Some current testing methods can
detect antibodies in response to

gay culture frighten me as well.
Generalizing a result of unsafe gay
promiscuity tothe whole community,
however, would be similar to me
claiming that all members of a
fraternity are date-rapists, or that all
Republicans are Christian zealots.
Stereotyping a group based on a fear
of its darkest and most disagreeable
qualities only serves to promote
ignorance and a further fission of
ideologies, consequently leading
to discriminatory practices. In the
case of MSM blood donation, until
the public eliminates the filter with
which they view gay society - and
learns to judge the gay community
as an assembly of individuals sharing
a common, overarching trait - we'll
continue to be banned.

Sleep and beauty

The Detroit Free Press fea-
tured an article in May titled
"Snooze or Lose," by Patri-
cia Montemurri.
After reading
a few lines, I
quickly discov-
ered that the
article focused
primarily on the
importance of
sleep in the lives SIERRA
of women. If the
article focused BROWN
solely on sleep's
ability to reduce
health issues I would have no com-
plaints. Instead, the author used
more than a third of the article to
discuss how sleep was "better for
beauty." The article discussed stud-
ies that have shown that women
apparently need more sleep than
men do. Women, however, are not
the only ones who wake up irritable
in the morning. I rarely do. How-
ever, if we do, we are not compelled
to stay mad 24/7. Are we to assume
that men always wake up happy and
full of life? I think not. Everyone has
bad mornings.
Montemurri's article stated that
without "restful" sleep women risk
waking up mad or hostile, and even
have an increased risk ofheartattacks
and strokes. "Why We Need to Pay
More Attention to Women's Sleep"
is an article featured in The Huffing-
ton Post, which argues that women
sleep differently than men. Similar to
claims made in Montemurri's article,
the article says that womentend to be
more sleep-deprived than men, and
are at an increased risk for insomnia.
There are biological and physiologi-
cal reasons that explain why women
sleep differently: "the sex chromo-
somes and gonadal hormones pri-
marily contribute to the biological
and physiological differences, and
these are called sex differences." In
addition, environmental, social and
cultural influences on biological fac-
tors contribute to gender differences.
Montemurri's article featured
sections on sleep aids for mothers,
women with insomnia and sleep
apnea's effect on women going

through menopause. Sleep apnea is
a serious sleeping disorder in which
breathing repeatedly stops and
starts during sleep. In Montemurri's
article, Neurology Prof. Dr. Ronald
Chervin, director of the University
of Michigan Sleep Disorders Center
and the Michael S. Aldrich Sleep
Disorders Laboratory, conducted
a study showing that patients
who were treated for sleep apnea
experienced improvements in their
facial skin. After viewing photos
of these patients' after-treatment
images, women described the images
as "more attractive, youthful and
alert." Are patients only interested in
the treatment for its physical results?
I assumed the most important part of
the treatment was actually treating
sleep apnea, which is associated
with heart disease and diabetes.
Are women only concerned with
how beautiful and youthful the
treatments will make them appear?
Well, why shouldn't they be?
"Now we're starting to use the
argument -
you'll look
younger, more At some p
attractive and m
more alert to most of us
people who see told that l
you," Chervin
said. Doctors matter. Di
and society
tell women miss this
that looking
beautiful and -
youthful is important. Amy Alkon
wrote an article for Psychology
Today, "The Truth About Beauty,"
which insinuates that more attention
is given to the physical appearance of
women than men. Alkon claims that
there are certain realities that most of
us accept, and amongthose istheugly
truththatmostmenwillnotlookatan
unattractive woman. But what makes
a woman unattractive? A great deal
of evidence shows that men prefer
women with the following features:
"youth, clearskin, asymmetricalface
andbody, feminine facial features, an
hourglass figure ... full lips, smaller
chins, and large eyes." Women do
not place as much emphasis on men's
looks, and are more interested in

finding male partners with high
status and power.
At some point in life, most of us
have been told that looks don't matter.
Did society miss this memo? Alkon's
article disclosed, "The more attractive
the woman is, the wider her pool
of romantic partners and range of
opportunities in her work and day-
to-day life." This is among one of the
ugly truths she mentioned, creating
"[women's] desperation to look like
they were born yesterday." Why does
societynotpickonmenfornotlooking
aesthetically pleasing?I amnot willing
to believe that people genuinely do not
care about men's appearance.
There is nothing wrong with
drawingattentionto women's health,
but when beautyis included the topic
loses a bit of its importance. I would
have preferred to read an articlethat
focused on informing both men and
women that more sleep is important
to their health. As a woman I am
proud to say that I am not consumed

more important
than physical beauty. I prefer to
worry about receiving an adequate
amount of sleep and maintaining
decent health rather than worrying
about ridding myself of all the
spots and blemishes that decorate
my face. Without sleep I become
useless because my body has zero
energy. As college students, sleep
is something we yearn for and
can never seem to get enough of.
Ladies, let's attain restful sleep
because we need it to be productive
and excel here at the University,
not because we are obsessed with
looking beautiful and youthful.

The atmospheric city of Bruno
Heller's "Gotham" is familiar;
suspended in perpetual smog and
held together
by aspider-web
of back alleys, B+
it practically Gotham
oozes cheap
neon. This is Mondays
the glum dys- at 8 p.m
topian scape FOX
of "Blade Run-
ner" and "Sin
City." It's a
formula, in a sense, but there's
never been a more dazzling shit-
hole on the small screen than in
FOX's new series "Gotham." I'm
a noir-lover, so there's a special
place in my heart for its aesthetic
trappings: the impeccable blonde
who doesn't-seem to have com-
mitments beyond glidingthrough'
her apartment in slinky silk, the
cynical detective with a chip on
his shoulder and a flask in his
pocket, the ubiquitous shots of
Chinatown street markets in the
murky depths of Lower Manhat-
tan - it's all there in the anachro-
nistic, rain-slicked Gotham.
As a prequel to the canonical-
Batman story, Bruce Wayne won't
fly to rescue for a couple decades,
and now it's crumbling under
corruption. "Gotham" starts out
with a minx-y Catwoman (new-
comer Camren Bicondova) lurk-

ing in the shadows of an alley as
Bruce Wayne becomes an orphan.
That scene encapsulates the
extent of my comic book knowl-
edge, and "Gotham" asks for little
more. This isn't a show catered
to fandom, yet knowledgeable
viewers will catch the handful of
unobtrusive winks and nods. It's
also good for the show to imme-
diately get the iconic scene out of
the way; Bruce Wayne's develop-
ment isn't the center of the show
and the adjoining investigation
guides us through a string of
characters that populate Gotham.
Stepping into the aforemen-
tioned central narrative gap is
young Jim Gordon (Ben McK-
enzie, "The O.C."), a fledgling
detective new to inter-depart-
ment politics and corruption,
who gets the Wayne case. His
hardened partner, Harvey Bull-
ock, (Donal Logue, "Sons of
Anarchy") has been in the sys-
tem long enough to not want
the high-profile investigation
on his hands. However, they
meet young Bruce who has some
mature heftpenciled inbybrood-
ing David Mazouz ("Touch").
Sean Pertwee's Alfred Penny-
worth gives a refreshing itera-
tion of the trusty guardian; he
doesn't have Michael Caine's
precise courteousness, a hair
more thuggish than gracious.
Gordon playing the naive
guy un-warped by the crooked
bureaucracy isn't the most con-

vincing; he's a little o' accept-
ing of the alliance between
organized crime and uniformed
enforcement that's revealed in
the pilot. However, the periph-
eral villains who encroach on
law and order are well-acted
and able to pick up the slack. In
particular, Fish Mooney (Jada
Pinkett Smith, "Madagascar")
is a welcome female addition to
the ranks of mob-boss overlords
who populated various Gothams
over the years.'Smith has a
darkly liquid presence, equal
parts menacing and sexy. Her
duplicitous minion, pre-Penguin
Oswald Cobblepot (Robin Lord
Taylor, "The Walking Dead")
is desperate and creepy, sure to
develop throughout the season.
"Gotham" will be an unusual
brand of procedural occupied by
larger than life characters, which
is an intriguing enough premise
to continue watching. More than
that, sans the large names the
movie franchises have, "Gotham"
still captures the cinematic gloss
that's made superhero movies so
watchable for non-fans. For its
family-friendly 8 p.m. timeslot,
it's a grim hour full of gloom and
gore and rumnblings of the ity's
imminent disintegration. The
"Batman" franchise has always
blurred the edges between the
two institutions, law enforce-
ment and the villains, and the
show carries on this skeptical
tradition.

'This Is All Yours'
shows band's
eclectic style

does. He even
wrote a song about it - called it
"The Gospel of John Hurt" - and
it's as weird as it sounds, maybe
even emblematic of Alt-J itself:
The band's outsider essence on
its sophomore album, This is All
Yours, refuses to conform to any

but 'pining', which is that feeling
when (basically) love turns to
shit and your heart is shattered
and sickens your mind and body
- all through awell-talked-about
Miley Cyrus sample.
But there's something also
funnyherethatI'mmissing,some
playful quality to the album that
was nonexistent on An Awesome
Wave, the band's Mercury-
Prize-winning first album. You
hear in the instrumentation on
"Garden of England," a Shire-
esque interlude filled with birds
and cheerful wood flutes (played
by Hobbits?) that on any other
album, would feel completely
out of place. You hear it on "Left
Hand Free," where Newman
has filtered his voice to mimic a
trucker-dude on the radio, so we
can imagine him wacking it with
his free left as he speeds down
I-90. And you hear it with silly
lines like: "Turn you inside out
to lick you like a crisp packet"
or "Love is a pharaoh and he's
boning me."

Call it prog-rock, indie-
electronica, experimental-folk,
whatever soothes our craving
to label and define. But This
Is All Yours just doesn't fit all
neat and tidy in any one box.
"Warm Foothills" is too ethereal
to be rock, "Arrival in Nara"
too acoustic to be electronica,
"Leaving Nara" too synthesized
to be folk.
I don't mean to dismiss genre
as superficial or claim Alt-J has
transcended its wide grasp.
Genre is important, and helps us
categorize a piece of art so we
can gain a deeper understanding
of both it and its relationship to
others. At least in theory. But I
feel like we think of genre too
squarely, use it too flippantlX.
This Is All Yours is great because
it challenges us to examine the
borders of genre, and maybe,
refuse its grasp. If you don't
believe me, find me another band
that can sample Miley, Cyrus
successfully. Come on, that's
radical.

were seven of them ... seven.)
But television horror is an
entirely different beast, if not
solely because it's so much
harder to pull off. Whereas
horror movies are almost
always characterized by their
quickly developing narratives
and one, simple mission -
get in, get scared, get out
- that mentality doesn't
work on the small screen.
When 90 minutes becomes a
potentially years-long saga,
there needs to be something
more.
One of the newest
offerings in the horror TV
landscape is FX's "The
Strain" from writer-director
Guillermo del Toro ("Pan's
Labyrinth"). The series
premiered on July 13 and was
met with awarm critical and
commercial response. But as
the season comes to a close,
I find myself questioning
the series' viability in the
long-run. In other words, I'm
beginning to think this show
kind of sucks.
Don't get me wrong;
"The Straih"is scary, and
it's featured some of the
most genuinely terrifying
sequences I've ever seen on
television. But this isn't the
big screen, and after many
hours of commitment to the
series - much longer than
any horror movie - it's clear
that "The Strain" uses horror
in more ways than one. In
reality, "The Strain" hides
behind its genre, akin to a
costumed kid on Halloween.
The appearance might do the
job, but ultimately, it's all just
a ruse.
Because really, "The
Strain" isn't a good show - a
fact that becomes clearer
with each passing week.
It's full of stock characters,
cheesy dialogue and illogical
developments, chief among
them that bureaucratic

'M' flashes big personality

Smith's late tally
continues streak

ByZACH SHAW
Daily Sports Writer
Michigan volleyball coach
Mark Rosen thinks something
clicked for his team after a
straight-set sweep of Eastern
Michigan on Saturday night.
If he's right, that could
have big implications for the
Wolverines and their opponents
in the Big Ten.
In the final non-conference
game before the daunting
conference season, Michigan
(5-5) showed improved ball
control and aggressiveness.
But most importantly, the
Wolverines showed personality
and energy in arguably their
best match of the season, just 24
hours after playing their worst.
"Tonight was the first time
I felt like I really saw the
personality of this team and the
style we're going to play," Rosen
said. "At times, I feel like we've
been throwing darts and trying
to figure out how things are
going to fit together. Tonight it
really flowed."
After taking the first set from
Kansas State (13-1) Friday night,
Michigan fell flat on offense
and defense, dropping the next
three sets by increasing scores,
which accumulated to 32 errors
in the match.
"(Kansas State) was a tough
match," Rosen said. "None of us
really felt good about it in any
9 way, and that's hard to come
back from when you only have
24 hours to refocus and turn
the page."
Following the loss, the
Wolverines had a long meeting
to identify what had to change.
For much of the season,
youth and development have
been common storylines for
Michigan, and growing pains
were expected in September.

The Michigan field hockey
team kept its win streak alive
Sunday in Kent, Ohio., defeating
Kent State, 3-2.
The 18th-ranked Wolverines
(1-0 Big Ten, 6-2 overall) had the
advantage
in every KENT STATE 2
statistical MICHIGAN 3
category
but often struggled to capitalize.
Michigan converted on just 3
of 37 attempts, while Kent State
(2-5) scored on 2 of 6 shots. So,
while Michigan outshot and
outcornered the Golden Flashes,
it still found itself in need of
some late-game heroics to seal
the win.
The winner came from fifth-
year senior defender; Leslie
Smith. A dependable veteran
and the Wolverines' leading
scorer, Smith converted on the
team's 10th corner opportunity
when she one-timed a pass from
fifth-year senior midfielder
Sammy Gray past Kent State's
goalkeeper and into the lower
right corner of the cage.
"I don't think that was our
best game," Smith said. "But we
came out with a win, and that's
what's most important. They're
a very physical team, butI think
we stayed toe-to-toe with them."
Sophomore attacker
Courtney Enge netted the first
goal for the Wolverines midway
through the first half on an
unassisted effort after stealing
the ball from a Golden Flashes
defender and firing it into the
net. Michigan dominated play
in the half, outshooting Kent
State, 18-2, but went into the
locker room up just 1-0.
"Their goalkeeper was
outstanding," said Michigan
coach Marcia Pankratz. "Their

defense and their tackling skills
were very strong. We were
putting the ball on goal and we
had an awful lot of shots, but
that's just the way the hockey
game goes sometimes."
Just13 secondsinto the second
half,theWolverines doubled their
lead with a goal by senior attacker
Emy Guttman, who redirected a
pass from sophomore midfielder
Eliza Stein.
However, the Golden Flashes
didn't go down easily, evening
the score with two goals in the
next 13 minutes.
After Kent State got on the
board, Michigan upped the
tempo, drawing three corners
and tallying seven shots before
Smith's game-winner. That tally
sealed the Wolverines' sixth
consecutive victory.
For Pankratz, herteasofdrive
and will to win overshadowed
any technical shortcomings it
may have shown.
"It was a hard-fought game
today, and I was really proud
of how poised we stayed,"
Pankratz said. "We didn't get
rattled, stuck to the game plan
and worked hard to finish.,
We finished strong down the
stretch and put the final goal in
that we needed. That was a big
game for us."
The win capped off an
important weekend for
Michigan, which opened Big Ten
play on Friday with an overtime
win at Penn State.
Now that the team has proven
it can win on the road as well as
at home, Michigan is focusing
on playingthe game its own way
and continuing its success.
"We really try to take it game
by game," Smith said. "We're
being Michigan.
"We're playing Michigan
field hockey, and I think we're
doing a great job of it."

as they fell RUTGERS 1
to Rutgers,
1-0 in Piscataway.
The loss snapped a five-
game winning streak for the
Wolverines (3-1 Big Ten, 7-3
overall). The Scarlet Knights
outshot Michigan, 14-7, with the
Wolverines failing to put a single
shot on net.
"We were just gassed," said
Michigan coach Greg Ryan.
"(Rutgers was) rested and fresher
than us from the first whistle.
They were just better today."
A scoreless deadlock was
finally broken in the 64th
minute, when the Michigan back
line couldn't deal with a low
cross, leaving substitute Jessica
Puchalski with a simple tap-in.
It was just the third goal
conceded by the Wolverines
during the past six games, but
they were lucky not to have
conceded more.

From the first snap of
the game, Gardner looked
uncomfortable behind center.
While the offensive line
struggled, the unit sporadically
gave Gardner some time to

quarterback was unable to

The most popular player on
a struggling football team is

usuallythe backup quarterback,
but that may no longer be the
case at Michigan. Sophomore
Shane Morris relieved Gardner
of his duties in the fourth
quarter, one series before the
rain delay. And while Morris
grabbed a couple of first downs
with his legs, he has yet to throw
a touchdown and ended his first
series with an interception.
Following the rain delay,
Morris fumbled the football and
upped the quarterback turn-

Five things we learned: Utah 26, Michigan 10


ByGREG GARNO'

ManagingSportsEditor
Everything seemed to fall
part in the Michigan football
beam's 26-10 loss to Utah on
Saturday. And the two-and-
n-half-hour rain delay almost
eenedtobe a welcome respite.
The Wolverinesawere exposed
against the Utes, struggling in
nearly all areas of the contest.
Here are the five things we
learned after a wild, wet affair.
1. The defense will carry
this team:
Thismuch isclear: Michigan's
defense is the reason it had a
chance to win on Saturday.
Utah entered Saturday with
the No. 3 offense in the country,
averaging 557.5 yards and 57.5
points. But the Wolverines held
them to 286 total yards.
Utes' quarterback Travis
Wilson and tepotent pgssing
attack finished with 205 yards.
Just three passes went for more
than 20 yards, including a short
seven-yard pass that turned into
67yards.
The rush defense eliminated
the ground game, the pass rush
finally got to the backfield to
record three sacks and they
grabbed an interception..
Michigan's defense even
provided, the offense by
way of redshirt sophomore
defensive tackle Willie Henry's
touchdown return.
And they did it all without
starting senior linebacker
Desmond Morgan, starting
senior cornerback Raymon
Taylor and starting junior safety
Jarrod Wilson.
If the Wolverines are going
to win games, especially against
offenses from Michigan State
and Ohio State, they're going to
need a defense to compensate
for an offense that can't get into
the red zone.
2. If you stop Devin
)unchess,youstop Michigan's
passing attack:

Junior receiver Devin Funchess and the Michigan offense were held without a touchdown Saturday afternoon. The Wolverines failed to reach Utah's red zone.

another went right down the
middle to Utah linebacker Gionni
Paul. Gardner's day - 14-for-26
with two interceptions - was a
disaster, and it wasn't the first
time it's happened this season.
It was enough to bring in
sophomore backup quarterback
Shane Morris in his place,
leaving Gardner on the sideline
for much of the fourth quarter.
Saturday, he reaffirmed his
three-interception game against
Notre Dame and his limited role
in the air against the RedHawks
as a trend.
5. Bold prediction: Shane
Morris will be the starter
before the Wolverines face
Michigan State
The conversation regarding
a potential quarterback
competition has changed in less
than a month.
In the middle of August,
Hoke said Gardner would be
the starter, as Morris watched
and learned. But now, he's
reevaluating his signal callers.
"We'll have a quarterback for
the Minnesota game and we'll
assess and compete and challenge
all week," Hoke said after the
game. "We'll see what happens."
That doesn't mean Morris will
impress by then, but Michigan
will likely needa change of pace
at quarterback and Gardner
could always move to wide
receiver if needed. And after
Gardner travels to Rutgers
or plays Penn State under the
lights, something will give for
Morris to step in.
The sophomore out of
Warren, Mich., didn't have
great stats in his limited time,
but he showed flashes that he
could still step in admirably. His
60-yard heave down the field, or
his run to move the chains on
third down was promising.
Gardner is still learning
offensive coordinator . Doug
Nussmeier's new system, and
Hoke and company may very
well think they're ready to save
time and start Morris.

Stats can be misleading, but
here's one that's not: Derrick

and De'Veon Smith rushed the
ball four times.
The sophomore running
backs were supposed to split
carries, Michigan coach Brady
Hoke said. But after Saturday,
the competition is, in essence,
over. It's Green's job now.
Green was already coming off
a game against Miami (Ohio), in
which he rushed for more than
120 yards and two touchdowns.
His 65 yards weren't
astounding, but it was more
production than Smith's five
yards. That's because Green
realized that he couldn't run in
between the tackles. He had to
rush to the outside and use his
speed to pick up yards.
Smith, meanwhile, was a
victim of the line's inability to
get a push against Utah's front

seven. Both are big and physical,
but Green figured out a way to
make something out of nothing.
And he's being rewarded for
that.
4. Devin Gardner is
indecisive and inaccurate:
Gardner's first two passes
were completions. His next
three fell incomplete. And in
between, he couldn't decide
whether he should pass as the
line collapsed or run.
When he passed to Jehu
Chesson in the first quarter, he
underthrew him. His next pass
was thrown into the middle of
four defenders and knocked
away from Funchess. The
Wolverines were kept out of the
red zone on the drive and held to
a field goal.
His throws went too far in
front of receivers. one ball was
tipped for an interception, and

four passes as Utah often threw
double or triple coverage his
way. It didn't stop Gardner from
throwing to Funchess.

So when Gardner steps back
to pass, Funchess will be his
target, even if three defenders
are covering him.
