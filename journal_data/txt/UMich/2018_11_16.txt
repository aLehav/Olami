Economic 
forecasters 
at 
the University of Michigan 
released 
their 
economic 
forecast 
report 
on 
Friday 
morning. 
According 
to 
the 
Research 
Seminar 
in 
Quantitative 
Economics, 
the 
Michigan 
economy 
is 
set to break its record of the 
longest period of job growth 
since World War II. Across 
the country, however, RSQE 
forecasters 
expect 
rapid 
economic growth to fade by 
the second quarter of the year.
These 
findings, 
as 
well 
as 
further 
data 
regarding 
population and job growth, 
are included in their annual 
analysis of the national and 
state 
economies, 
headed 
by 
RSQE 
Director 
Gabriel 
Ehrlich. The report detailed 
uninterrupted job growth in 
Michigan spanning from the 
third quarter of 2009 to the 
third quarter of 2018. This 

Governor-elect 
Gretchen 
Whitmer has selected University 
of 
Michigan 
Regent 
Mark 
Bernstein (D) as the leader of her 
gubernatorial transition team.
In this capacity, Bernstein will 
be responsible for overseeing the 
implementation 
of 
Whitmer’s 
governing 
infrastructure. 
This 
will include establishing senior 
leadership 
positions 
and 
key 
operators in the administration 
(including cabinet-level officials), 
building policy teams, conducting 
departmental 
reviews 
and 
generally ensuring that Whitmer 
and her team are ready to quickly 
begin effective work when she 
takes office on Jan. 1.
Bernstein was elected to the 
Board of Regents in 2012 with a 
campaign focused heavily on the 
high cost of college attendance at 
the University. This is a focus shared 
by Whitmer, whose 2018 campaign 
included 
increased 
increasing 
funding for state public institutions. 

CRIME

LSA junior Nayir Masrur 
was 
charged 
with 
first-
degree murder Wednesday in 
connection with the death of 
his aunt, Rubab Huq. Huq was 
55 years old, and a mother of 
two boys. 
Masrur,

is 
accused 
of murdering Huq using a 
15-pound dumbbell in the 

basement of a home in Troy 
Monday 
afternoon, 
where 
both Masrur and Huq are 
from.
Police were called to Huq’s 
home in Troy around 2:30 
p.m. on Monday. They were 
responding to a call from 
Masrur’s mother, who was 
reporting Masrur as a missing 
person in an agitated state,

Central 
Student 
Government, Student Legal 
Services and the University of 
Michigan Credit Union hosted 
an 
interactive 
workshop 
Thursday to educate students 
on how to achieve financial 
health and security while 
at the University and after 
graduation.
CSG 
President 
Daniel 
Greene, a Public Policy senior, 
said the goal of the workshop 
was to give students access 
to 
underutilized 
resources 
on campus and to prepare 
them financially for the post-
graduation world.
“This is part of Central 
Student 
Government’s 
new series of events and 
workshops to help ensure 
students 
are 
optimizing 
their 
Michigan 
experience 
and prepared to enter the 
real 
world,” 
Greene 
said. 
“We’re hoping that we can 
provide events like ‘Achieving 
Financial Wellness’ that will 
provide information and skills 
and on-campus resources that 
students might not be aware 
of, or are unaware of all the 
resources they do provide, 
and we’re hoping to provide 
a mainstream platform for 
students to be able to navigate 

the Michigan experience.”
A survey conducted in 2017 
by The Daily found students 
struggled 
with 
financial 
literacy, with 23 percent of 
students feeling financially 
unprepared for college 
The event started with 
Doug 
Lewis, 
director 
of 
Student 
Legal 
Services, 
warning 
attendees 
about 
scammers 
that 
use 
fake 
companies to hire students 
and commit financial crimes.

Mark 
Munzenberger, 
financial education specialist 
at the University of Michigan 
Credit Union, then began his 
presentation by comparing 
financial health to physical 
health. He discussed how 
if people are sick, there are 
behavioral actions they take to 
improve their well-being. He 
claimed the same philosophy 
applies to financial health 
and 
students 
should 
take 
four actions to improve their 

financial wellness — spend, 
save, borrow and plan.
Munzenberger 
then 
discussed how both long-term 
and short-term savings are 
important. 
Munzenberger 
said he wanted to place an 
emphasis on short-term saving 
in case of an emergency.
“There needs to be some 
sort of emphasis on short-
term saving,” Munzenberger

The University of Michigan 
Biosciences Initiative recently 
set aside $5.6 million to fund 
the creation of the Michigan 
Concussion 
Center. 
The 
center, which will be led by 
Prof. Steven Broglio, director 
of the NeuroTrauma Lab, 
will focus on understanding 
concussion 
prevention, 
treatment 
and 
long-term 
consequences.
Twenty 
years 
ago, 
concussions were not taken 
seriously as a real injury. 

Because there was so little 
information available on the 
nature and ramifications of 
the injury, it was common for 
football 
players 
who 
got 
knocked out during a game 
to be put back in 10 minutes 
later. Today, though, doctors 
and researchers have come 
a long way in understanding 
concussions, 
and 
strong 
efforts have been made to 
improve injury assessment 
and treatment. Still, there 
remain 
many 
unanswered 
questions, 
particularly 
in 
grasping what the long-term 
effects are.
The Michigan Concussion 

Center’s 
structure 
will 
revolve around three main 
cores: research, clinical and 
outreach. To meet the needs 
of the different cores, the 
center has pulled together 
faculty members from across 
different University campuses 
and 
disciplines. 
Andrea 
Almeida, 
clinical 
assistant 
professor of Neurology, who 
will co-direct the clinical 
care core at the Michigan 
Concussion Center, stressed 
the collaborative nature of 
the project. She also cited the 
center’s unique ability to draw 
on expertise from all over the 
University to produce a more 
comprehensive line of 
concussion research.
“The 
Michigan 
Concussion 
Center 
is 
exciting because it will 
allow us to build on 
our strong foundation 
and 
enhance 
existing 
collaborations 
by 
unifying diverse faculty 
and 
staff 
across 
the 
University making U of 
M an international leader 
in the field of concussion 
education, research and 
clinical care,” Almeida 
wrote in an email to The 
Daily.
Getting a concussion 
can be scary. Business 
sophomore 
Kelvin 
Chang suffered a mild 
concussion earlier this 
semester 
after 
falling 
off his bike when his 
front mud-guard came 
loose. He believes the 
concussion 
negatively 
affected his performance 
in school.
“I 
felt 
constantly 
sleepy 
and 
lack 
of 
motivation afterwards,” 

Chang wrote in an email 
interview with The Daily. “I 
would go as far as saying that 
my grade dropped due to my 
concussion. I was lucky that 
it was a mild case and the 
sleepiness went away after a 
week. However, may it be the 
concussion or the sophomore 
slump, I have been finding it 
harder to concentrate on work 
afterwards.”
Even though Chang has 
recovered, he is still worried 
about the ways his injury 
might continue to affect him.
“I am still worried to this 
day if I am experiencing 
effects that I simply don’t 
know,” he said.
Chang is not alone in 
holding these concerns, and 
long-term effects will be the 
primary focus of the Michigan 
Concussion Center, according 
to Broglio.
“The big question everyone 
is asking is, ‘What happens 
30 years later?’” Broglio said. 
“We really want to get into 
what the long-term effects 
are. And if there are long-
term effects that we have to 
be worried about, how do we 
mitigate them, how do we 
prevent them, what can we do 
on the front end, to stop the 
things on the back end?”
Most long-term studies on 
concussion effects are still 
in their initial stages. One 
current study takes college 
students and follows up with 
them every year for 30 years 
after 
they 
graduate. 
The 
study currently has 30 sites 
across the country and 45,000 
participants.
Thirty years is a long 
time to wait for results, 
and Broglio said there are

BE HIND THE STORY

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, Business freshman 
Michael Zhang covered “A Painful Hope,” a dialogue around 
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict featuring two speakers from the 
respective regions.

“I thought it was a really interesting experience. Obviously this one wa 
s bit different because I wasn’t allowed to record but I really enjoyed 
having a little wrench thrown in the process. It definitely helped me 
to learn how to report a bit better as well as helping me learn how to 
format the articles. I enjoyed getting to hear the actual speakers, which 
I found to be super interesting.”

“The U.S. has found domestic ways to avoid the prohibition of separating children from 
their parents, to avoid the duty not to detain refugee claimants other than briefly and 
after showing it to be necessary in the individual case, and generally to give asylum 
to people who meet the agreed definition of a refugee, including all of the rights that 
go with it,” Hathaway said. “This is not just a series of acts that are internationally 
prohibited but they are acts that are fundamentally at odds with our own core values 
and with our own history.”

still a lot of questions to be 
answered in the short term. 
Across 
campus, 
there 
are 
faculty 
members 
working 
on safer helmet technology, 
improving diagnostic tools, 
injury 
management 
and 
interventions. 
Broglio 
also 
thinks by the time the 30 
years are over, people will 

generally have an idea of how 
concussions 
affect 
people 
down the line.
“It’s not going to be radio 
silence for 30 years and then 
one paper done,” Broglio said. 
“Things will come out along 
the way. To be quite honest, 
by the time we get to year 30 
we’ll probably pretty much 
know at that point.”
The research Broglio and 
other 
University 
faculty 
members have been working 

on has already started to 
affect policy at the college 
football level. Broglio hopes 
that his research will continue 
to benefit sports.
“Some of the stuff we’ve 
done has already influenced 
preseason practice rules in 
college football,” Broglio said. 
“I just think that will continue 
to grow, and that’s our goal. If 
we can’t influence sport in a 
positive way, then what’s the 
point?”

evening: first, an afternoon 
panel facilitated by students of 
the Ford School of Public Policy 
to speak, and a larger event 
in the evening organized by 
Washtenaw Youth Initiative at 
the Neutral Zone in downtown 
Ann Arbor.
The University of Michigan 
awards the meda annually to 
individuals who have shown 
great bravery in the sphere 
of 
social 
justice. 
Student 
representatives 
from 
both 
groups 
were 
the 
youngest 
honorees in the award’s 28-year 
history.
B.R.A.V. 
E. 
violence 
prevention coordinator Lamar 
Johnson 
represented 
the 
Chicago-based youth advocacy 
training program at the events, 
and was joined by Alex Wind 
and 
Sofie 
Whitney 
from 
Marjory 
Stoneman 
Douglas 
High School in Parkland, Fla., 
both survivors of the fatal 
shooting at their school last Feb. 
14. March for Our Lives was 
born out of activism of students 
following the mass shooting, 
while B.R.A.V.E. was founded in 
2009 by grassroots movements 
in Chicago united against local 
violence. The two organizations 
formed a coalition following the 
Parkland shooting in an attempt 
to 
take 
an 
intersectional 
approach 
to 
activism, 
and 
further 
highlighting 
the 
quotidian nature of of gun 
violence.
The three began the Ford 
event by lighting a candle in 
remembrance of the lives lost 
to gun violence. Then, they 
entered into a conversation 
about student activism: what 
it is, what it requires, why it’s 
important and how it looked 
when they did it.
“We like to create rooms 
that should have never existed 
and would have never existed 
before,” Whitney remarked.
All 
of 
the 
panelists 
emphasized the need to engage 
the whole of society in gun 
violence prevention in order 
to see salient change. Wind 
advised 
student 
activists 
to 
involve 
their 
friends, 
contact 
their 
congressional 
representatives and “keep the 
conversation going.”

“We need to be the people 
who keep talking about it,” 
Wind said. “We need the 
people who are remembering 
the victims. We need to be the 
people that are really trying to 
fix the things that are wrong in 
this country.”
Wind 
and 
the 
others 
expressed frustration at the 
fact that coverage for instances 
of gun violence too often seems 
to be temporary or altogether 
nonexistent.
Endless work on such a heavy 
issue makes it difficult to keep 
a cheery disposition. Whitney 
recommended “finding those 
moments of light” by forging 
strong relationships with others 
in the field as a mechanism.
“I can’t get the best out of 
you if I don’t care about you,” 
Johnson added. Coming from 
the perspective of an adult and 
mentor, he emphasized the need 
to care “holistically” about your 
cohort.
Wind, too, said that the 
work 
itself 
contributes 
to 
the betterment of his own 
emotional state.
“This work is very healing 
for me because what I do is to 
try and ensure that no one else 
my age or even younger has to 
go through this trauma,” Wind 
said.
Wind, Whitney and Johnson 
implored attendees of the event 
to continue the momentum of 
activism present in the world 
today. 
Citing 
high 
turnout 
rates in youth voters in midterm 
elections last week, they predict 
that gun violence prevention 
will be something young people 
continue to push.
“Do two things: stay loud and 
stay impatient,” Johnson said. 
“We cannot afford to wait for 
things to change.”
Public 
Policy 
graduate 
student Leah Squires, one of 
the event’s facilitators, said 
she appreciated hearing the 
different perspectives of the 
panelists.
“What I derived the greatest 
benefit from was hearing the 
varied 
perspectives 
of 
the 
speakers,” Squires said. “They 
represent and approach anti-
gun violence activism from 
very different perspectives and 
concepts but are motivated by a 
shared vision.”
Just hours later, the panelists 
shifted down a few blocks 
to the Neutral Zone, a youth 

community organizing space in 
downtown Ann Arbor. There, 
they met with students from 
Washtenaw 
Youth 
Initiative 
who began organizing against 
gun violence in Ann Arbor, 
Ypsilanti and Saline in March, 
inspired by March for Our 
Lives. WYI held rallies, a die-
in and a town hall in the spring, 
lobbied to get out the vote in the 
midterms and is now planning 
programming to activate local 
youth.
At Thursday’s event, students 
from more than six local high 
schools shared strategy with 
the visiting activists, and then 
faciliated a dialogue and Q&A 
afterwards attended by more 
than 150 people.
“We’re trying to force kids 
from the corners of the county 
to the center stage, to give them 
a platform,” Rosie Kendall, a 
student at Saline High School, 
said of WYI’s community work.
Every organizer agreed on 
the importance of electoral 
activism, even though many of 
them were too young ot vote 
themselves. They also noted, 
however, their work extended 
beyond any campaign or ballot.
“Now, it’s time to hold the 
people we elected accountable,” 
Whitney said.
Many of the local high 
schoolers 
emphasized 
the 
intersectionality at the center 
of WYI. 
 “We have to acknowledge 
our predecessors who have 
been struggling for decades,” 
Zaynab Alkolaly, a student at 
Washtenaw Technical Middle 
College, shared. “This is not 
to erase peope, and you all do 
a great job of checking your 
privilege. But we have to lift all 
of us up.”
WYI 
organizer 
Mani 
Harrison agreed with Alkolaly, 
and is crafting a series of events 
to combat activism rife with 
racial myopia.
 “In Ann Arbor, we aren’t 
centering Black and (people of 
color) voices enough,” she said.
The 
young 
activists 
connected over their shared 
vision nad hope for the future. 
It is this foresight, they agreed, 
that is also a driving force in 
organizing movements.
“You kinda gotta have infinite 
hope, what Dr. King talked 
about,” Johnson said. “Be a 
prisoner of hope.”

said the incident appears to be 
a brutal, unprovoked attack.
In a Facebook post shared 
by Rubab Huq’s eldest son, 
Farhan Huq, an alum of the 
University 
medical 
school, 
Rubab is described as a loving 
mother and physician, who was 
herself mourning the loss of her 
husband to lung cancer. In the 
post, Farhan said his mother 
was an inspiration.
“She finished her family 
medicine 
residency, 
she 

provided a loving home for 
us, filled with wisdom and 
love and support that knew no 
bounds,” Farhan wrote. “She 
was a phenomenal physician 
by day and a phenomenal mom 
by night. She was a real-life 
wonder woman who somehow, 
magically, could really do it 
all.”
“Her last words to me were, 
‘Baba (my son), onik jothno 
korey tomake ar tomar bhai kea 
manush korechi,’” he continued. 
“ (Or) ‘I worked really hard to 
raise you and your brother.’ 
She was so inspirational that 
it drew me closer to God. She 
passed away as she lived - in the 
service of others.” 
Huq ended the post by asking 
for prayers for his mother. 

MURDER
From Page 1A

Last summer, many speculated 
Bernstein 
might 
runfor 
the 
governor’s seat himself, though 
he squashed these rumors by the 
time Whitmer’s campaign began 
to pick up steam.
Bernstein told The Michigan 
Daily he could not comment on 
his new role, instead referring 
The Daily to Michelle Grinnell, 
the communications director for 
the Whitmer transition team. In 
an interview, Grinnell pointed to 
Bernstein’s experience as a regent 
and education advocate as reasons 
for the choice.
“In addition to the shared 
values he has with Governor-
elect Whitmer, as director of the 
Transition 
Office, 
(Bernstein) 
brings a wealth of experience 
in addressing complex issues in 
a thoughtful, pragmatic way,” 
Grinnell said in an email. “This 
will be critical to accomplishing 
the significant work … in a very 
short amount of time.”
Bernstein’s 
record 
as 
an 
effective 
pragmatist 
is 
corroborated by his colleague on 
the board, Regent Ron Weiser (R). 
Weiser has worked with Bernstein 
since he was elected to the board 
and knew him for years before 
then. Weiser, for his part, served 
on the finance team for Presisdent 
Donald 
Trump’s 
national 
campaignand 
inauguration 
committee.

“He’s very bright,” Weiser, the 
lone Republican on the Board of 
Regents, said. “He’s very articulate 
— very well spoken, and a very 
good advocate. He has a strong 
political center and I think that he 
will help them organize well and 
focus on things that are important 
for the future of the state. I think 
he does that at the (University).”
Public Policy junior Katie Kelly, 
the 
communications 
director 
of University chapter of College 
Democrats, expressed a similar 
confidence in Bernstein and a 
hope that he and Whitmer will 
continue their focus on education 
during the transition.
“(College Democrats) have a lot 
of respect for Regent Bernstein,” 
Kelly said. “We hope by having 
somebody tied so closely to the 
University that the administration 
will 
have 
more 
affordable 
University cost at the forefront of 
their policy formulation.”
College 
Democrats 
worked 
extensively 
for 
the 
Whitmer 
campaign and hosted a rally on 
campus on Oct. 19 with Whitmer 
and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., 
speaking at the event. Kelly, who 
is among those who worked to 
elect Whitmer, emphasized the 
importance of an advocate for 
education 
such 
as 
Bernstein 
shaping administration policy.
“Just having someone who has 
the voices of students in mind 
having a direct connection to the 
administration — as students, 
that’s an invaluable connection 

to have,” Kelly said. “One of the 
reasons we supported Gretchen 
Whitmer is that she supports 
students 
and 
has 
mentioned 
many times that affordable prices 
of colleges is one of her main 
priorities. So having someone 
like Regent Bernstein in her 
administration, we hope that they 
will keep students in mind while 
formulating policy.”
According 
to 
Grinnell, 
Bernstein has no plans for a 
permanent role in the Whitmer 
administration. His influence will 
nonetheless be felt as he helps craft 
the organizational structures that 
will shape the administration’s 
early days.
Whitmer and Bernstein also 
face the challenge of preparing 
to govern a state with centrist 
political 
tendencies. 
Though 
most statewide elected offices 
will be controlled by Democrats 
starting next year, Republicans 
hold majorities in both bodies 
of the state legislature, and the 
state’s delegation to the House 
of Representatives is split evenly 
between the two parties. Weiser, 
expressing further confidence in 
Bernstein’s abilities, said that his 
skills are well-suited to the divided 
government that Whitmer will 
face when she enters the office.
“I think he’ll do a fantastic job,” 
Weiser said. “He knows how to 
work with people, and he knows 
how to work across the aisle. And 
that’s going to be necessary for this 
new administration.”

BERNSTEIN

said. 
“What 
would 
happen 
if you got sick or got in a car 
accident and you needed money 
quick? We need to have some 
short-term savings. It is not 
always for bad stuff, it could be 
for vacations or gifts. However, 
everyone in this room, having 
a focus on longer-term savings 
in your 20s once you finish here 
will make a huge difference.”
The conversation moved to 
the importance of utilizing 
a 
budget. 
Munzenberger 
encouraged students to think of 
a budget like a tool.
“I really would prefer you 
to think of (a budget) like a 
tool, like a laptop or a Fitbit,” 
Munzenberger said. “That’s all 
a budget is, a financial tool to 
keep things organized.”
Munzenberger 
then 

discussed how credit cards 
involve 
borrowing 
money, 
and how he has worked with 
many students who get in over 
their 
heads. 
Munzenberger 
recommended 
all 
students 
check their credit report every 
year to make sure it is accurate 
and in a good place and to avoid 
identity theft.
Lewis 
offered 
help 
from 
Student Legal Sevrices to any 
University student who finds 
a problem on their credit card, 
saying the office can dispute 
the issue.
“If you do find an error on 
your credit card, come to the 
office and we’ll challenge it,” 
Lewis said.
Munzenberger added that 
a low credit score can impact 
one’s insurance rates, loan 
applications, 
employment 
odds and experience renting 
apartments. He recommended 
students keep track of why, 

where and how much they 
spend.
“Be careful of this — I 
told you houses and cars are 
expensive, sometimes it is little 
stuff, lunches, Starbucks, just 
tons and tons of this little stuff 
that adds up,” Munzenberger 
said.
Munzenberger 
ended 
the 
presentation 
by 
advising 
students to use cash if they are 
spending under $10 because 
they will end up spending less.
LSA 
sophomore 
Hershy 
Jalluri said she learned how 
much each individual payment 
can affect her credit score.
“I think the impact that 
small things that you do, day to 
day interactions, can have on 
your credit score,” Jalluri said. 
“Since we’re college students, 
it seems like one payment isn’t 
going to be a big deal, but it can 
make a huge impact.”

SAVINGS
From Page 1A

nine-year streak is tied only 
with the period ranging from 
the spring quarter in 1991 to 
spring 2000.
According to the report, job 
growth in the state is expected 
to continue to increase over the 
next two years, adding 35,800 
jobs in 2019 and 39,300 more 
in 2020. By the end of 2020, 
Michigan is expected to recoup 
four of every five jobs lost since 
the mid-2000s.
From 2010 to 2017, Michigan 
saw a 29 percent rise in the 
number of college-educated 25 
to 34-year-olds moving to the 
state. International migration 
also 
contributed 
to 
this 
population growth, expected to 
make up 55 percent of the state 
population by 2025.
In a press release, Ehrlich 
said international migration 
has 
a 
growing 
impact 
on 
the 
state’s 
population 
and 
will 
continue 
to 
increase. 
A 
rise 
in 
college-educated 

residents could also accelerate 
popualation growth. According 
to the report, the state’s share 
of college-educated 25-to-34-
year-olds rose by 29 percent 
from 2010 to 2017. 13 of the 
16 largest cities in the state 
also surpassed the national 
average growth rate in young 
adults with at least a bachelor’s 
degree.
“International migration is 
an especially important driver 
of 
Michigan’s 
population 
growth because without it, the 
state’s population aged 4 or 
younger is projected to shrink 
by 200,000 residents by 2025,” 
Ehrlich said.
Within 
the 
automotive 
sector, U.S. light vehicle sales 
are expected to decline in 
the next two years — Ford 
Motor Co., General Motors 
Corp. and Chrysler’s share of 
sales has decreased since last 
year, according to the report. 
Leading sectors included in 
the report for this year are 
construction, professional and 
business services and health 
services. Low unemployment 

rates have also contributed 
to 
Michigan’s 
recovering 
economy. The unemployment 
rate for the state this year 
averaged 4.4 percent and is 
projected to fall to 3.8 percent 
by 2020.
Zooming 
out 
to 
the 
national economic landscape, 
forecasters predict the benefits 
of President Donald Trump’s 
tax cuts will wear off in 2020, 
even as wage growth remains 
healthy. 
“Wage 
growth—the 
one 
thing that had been missing 
from 
the 
full-employment 
labor 
market 
picture 
— 
finally appears to be picking 
up,” 
the 
report’s 
executive 
summary reads. “The October 
reading 
of 
average 
hourly 
earnings of workers in private 
nonfarm employment clocked 
in at a well-received 3.1 percent 
year-over-year rate, the first 
time since May 2009 that this 
measure of wage growth has 
exceeded 3 percent.”

CONCUSSIONS

W

e are more than a 
week removed from 
the 2018 midterm 
elections, 
and 
basically 
everything to be said about 
the electoral side of things has 
been said. What was projected 
to be a “blue wave” for the 
Democratic 
party 
did 
not 
quite come to fruition. While 
the Democrats were able to 
flip enough seats to take back 
the House of Representatives, 
their majority is slim and, 
in the process, they lost two 
valuable seats in the Senate. 
Despite receiving a significant 
amount of criticism following 
the 2016 presidential election, 
the polls and prognosticators 
reaffirmed their legitimacy 
this time around.
Much was made of the 
gains of female candidates in 
the midterms as women were 
declared the real winners 
of the election. One notable 
female victor was Michigan’s 
now Governor-elect Gretchen 
Whitmer. 
Furthermore, 
Representative-elect 
Ilhan 
Omar 
of 
Minnesota’s 
5th 
Congressional 
district 
and 
Representative-elect Rashida 
Tlaib 
of 
Michigan’s 
13th 
Congressional district made 
history by becoming the first 
two Muslim women elected to 
Congress.
And while female political 
empowerment is certainly a 
cause for celebration, now 
that we have had a week to 
bask in said victories, it is 
important that we turn our 
attention to something a little 
more unsavory. This cycle saw 
an 
unprecedented 
amount 
of money funneled into it. 
According to the Center for 
Responsive 
Politics, 
these 
midterm 
congressional 
campaigns cost a staggering 
$5.2 billion.
And while it is true that 
many campaigns — such as 
unsuccessful Texas Democrat 
Beto O’Rourke’s campaign for 
Senate — were able to raise 
huge sums of money primarily 
through small-scale donors 
and contributions, to ignore 
the influence of the oligarchy 
in propping up candidates and 
pushing them to the finish 

line would be foolish. The 
simple fact is that far too 
much of this money came from 
far too few people. The super 
PACs that the vast majority of 
Americans oppose are more 
influential than ever. In the 
month of October alone, the 10 
highest-funded super PACs for 
each of the two major political 
parties raised a combined $174 
million.
The 
disproportionate 
impact of billionaires was 
also 
in 
full 
force 
during 
this election cycle. While I 
normally direct my criticism 
towards the Republican Party, 
this election cycle proved 
that both major parties are 
completely bought and sold. 
Plutocrats drive the agenda, 
and I can prove it.

One 
example 
of 
this 
occurred in Tennessee. GOP 
mega-donor 
Charles 
Koch 
poured 
$5 
million 
of 
his 
own money into the coffers 
of Trump-loyalist U.S. Rep. 
Marsha Blackburn’s campaign 
for 
Senate 
in 
Tennessee. 
Maybe he was just really 
excited by her campaign. Or 
maybe he wants a piece of the 
corporate tax cuts and the 
repeal of the estate tax for 
which she has advocated for 
so long.
On the Democratic side, 
a 
particularly 
egregious 
example 
of 
electoral 
manipulation 
during 
this 
cycle by the ultra-rich took 
place in Nevada, in regards to 
what was known as “Question 
3.” 
The 
proposal 
asked 
voters whether or not they 
would want a constitutional 
amendment 
requiring 

lawmakers to pass measures 
in an attempt to establish 
a competitive, free market 
for energy. Investor Warren 
Buffett, one of the richest 
men on Earth, shelled out 
$63 million through Nevada 
Energy to wage a propaganda 
campaign against the passing 
of the proposal. His motives 
could not have been clearer.
Buffett is the owner of 
Nevada Energy, which is the 
current 
monopoly 
supplier 
of electricity in the state. 
A man worth a whopping 
$86 billion was hellbent on 
protecting his profit margins 
at all costs — at the expense of 
the general public. He could 
not accept the prospect of 
Nevadians potentially seeing 
their energy costs go down, so 
he put up an ungodly amount 
of cash to ensure that didn’t 
happen. Here’s the worst part 
— he got his way.
The 
disproportionate 
influence 
of 
those 
of 
astronomical means on our 
political system is nothing 
short of a disgrace. It is 
an 
affront 
to 
democratic 
ideals and the idea of “one 
person, one vote.” While all 
of-age citizens — who aren’t 
convicted 
felons 
or 
being 
actively suppressed by racist 
voter 
ID 
and 
registration 
laws — have the right to voice 
their opinion at the ballot 
box, we must reckon with the 
fact that we are only given a 
choice within the confines 
of what the super-rich find 
acceptable. We might play 
the game, but they make the 
rules.
Now that the elections are 
over, it is incumbent upon 
all Americans to work to 
hold elected officials’ feet 
to the fire. One way to do 
this is to make sure they are 
accountable to the people, 
and not their mega-donors. 
We have to bring campaign 
finance 
reform 
to 
the 
forefront if we wish to salvage 
democracy and respect the 
popular will.

A 

few 
weeks 
ago, 
thousands of Google 
employees 
from 
across 
the 
globe 
staged 
what the media is calling a 
walkout. Employees refused 
to work as they protested 
the 
company’s 
treatment 
of 
sexual 
assault 
claims. 
The walkout was in direct 
response to a scathing piece 
published by The New York 
Times which detailed Google’s 
track 
record 
of 
protecting 
high-profile executives, even 
after determining the sexual 
harassment 
claims 
against 
them were credible.
The piece looked closely 
at Andy Rubin, the creator of 
the Android mobile software. 
An employee accused Rubin 
of sexual misconduct after he 
coerced her into performing 
oral sex in a hotel room in 2013. 
Google chose to investigate 
and 
ultimately 
concluded 
that her claim was credible. 
Andy Rubin was subsequently 
asked to leave the firm — but 
not without a $90 million exit 
package. The Times reported in 
the same piece that Rubin was 
one of three executives that 
Google protected over the past 
decade after they were accused 
of sexual misconduct.
Employees, 
disappointed 
with a culture that they felt 
protected 
perpetrators 
of 
sexual 
misconduct, 
began 
communicating with each other 
to stage a protest. Walkout 
organizers generated a list of 
demands on how Google (which 
at one point in time boasted the 
motto: Don’t be evil) should not 
only handle sexual misconduct, 
but how it should also improve 
its culture. 
The demands included ending 
the use of private arbitration 
in sexual misconduct issues 
and publicizing a transparency 
report which detailed instances 
of sexual harassment. Beyond 
issues relating specifically to 
sexual 
harassment 
(though 
they 
are 
complicatedly 

intertwined), the organizers 
asked 
for 
an 
employee 
representative 
on 
Google’s 
Board of Directors and a chief 
diversity officer that to speak 
directly to the board.
The walkout at Google is the 
latest instance of the #MeToo 
movement’s effect on corporate 
America. Started 12 years ago 
by Tarana Burke and having 
gained attention nearly a year 
ago with the public humiliation 
of 
film 
producer 
Harvey 
Weinstein after he was accused 
of rape and sexual harassment, 
the 
#MeToo 
movement 
has come a long way. Many 
powerful men have been forced 
out of their cushy executive-

level jobs. Just a few weeks ago, 
Leslie Moonves stepped down 
as CEO of CBS after accusations 
of sexual harassment were 
publicly disclosed.
The 
#MeToo 
movement 
has 
generated 
awareness 
regarding the prevalence and 
severity of sexual harassment 
in 
organizations 
spanning 
all 
sectors. 
Organizations 
have been forced to either 
design or adopt mechanisms 
that 
minimize 
the 
amount 
of 
workplace 
harassment. 
Many 
companies 
have 
set 
up independent, anonymous 
helplines that give employees 
the 
opportunity 
to 
report 
misconduct without fear of 
immediate repudiation. While 
these mechanisms may prove 
useful in the short term, The 
Economist suggests in a piece 
titled 
“American 
business 
and 
#MeToo” 
that 
sexual 

harassment 
is 
“a 
symptom 
of bigger, subtler problems: 
unequal access to power and 
unaccountable cultures.”
The walkout organizers at 
Google had the right idea with 
their demands that extended 
beyond calling for change in 
how 
the 
company 
handles 
instances of sexual harassment. 
Their last two demands (an 
employee representative on the 
board and a more influential 
chief diversity officer) work 
toward 
transforming 
the 
company’s culture — ideally 
making it more inclusive and 
accountable.
Greater 
employee 
input 
at the executive level would 
benefit not only individuals 
commonly 
associated 
with 
the #MeToo movement, but 
instead, 
a 
host 
of 
people 
with other identities found 
throughout 
the 
company’s 
ranks. Gillian White writes in 
The Atlantic that the #MeToo 
movement has “been centered 
on the experiences of white, 
affluent and educated women.” 
Avoiding this fault, the walkout 
organizers intelligently used 
the momentum generated from 
the 
#MeToo 
backlash 
over 
Andy Rubin to call for greater 
involvement from all employees 
— regardless of not only gender 
and rank, but of race, sexual 
orientation and socioeconomic 
class too.
While it is still uncertain 
to 
what 
demands 
Google 
will 
completely 
concede, 
the walkout should serve as 
an inspiration to employees 
seeking to work in safer, more 
accountable and more inclusive 
environments. 
Employees, 
when acting together, can hold 
significant leverage over their 
employers. Employees need to 
make it known that they are 
a stakeholder to be reckoned 
with.

“T

o 
demand 
that 
people 
take 
personal 
responsibility 
for 
their 
behavior 
is 
extremely 
difficult. 
It 
doesn’t 
come 
naturally to any of us. Perhaps 
the case for it can best be 
made by using other words 
to 
describe 
the 
assuming 
of 
personal 
responsibility. 
Those words are ‘growing 
up.’” This quote from Dennis 
Prager 
captures 
a 
major 
societal problem today. People 
today, from young adults to 
politicians, too often make 
excuses for their negative 
behavior instead of owning up 
and trying to improve the way 
they act.
Taking 
responsibility 
for 
our actions was hammered 
into many of us by our parents 
and teachers when we were 
children. We learned to do our 
chores and homework, and 
that we are accountable for our 
behavior. My parents told me 
that my grades in school would 
reflect the amount of work I 
put in. They did not consider 
that my teacher was bad, or 
that I’d be distracted by my 
friends, or that maybe I just 
didn’t like the subject or school 
in general. Those were not and 
are not adequate excuses. The 
lesson that your life is in your 
own hands is something lost by 
many today.
The 
conduct 
of 
many 
politicians today has, at times, 
sunk far below civility. Even 
some of the more reserved, 
professional 
representatives 
have had moments of weakness.
During the 2016 presidential 
primary 
race, 
Sen. 
Marco 
Rubio, R-Fla., responded poorly 
to outside stimuli but proved 
to be a perfect example of 
assuming sole responsibility 
for his conduct. Rubio, in 
response to Trump’s continued 
and relentless barbs and jokes 

about 
the 
competition 
for 
the 
Republican 
nomination 
for the presidency, began to 
make the same type of jokes 
about Trump. He joked about 
Trump’s constant tweeting, his 
spelling mistakes and even his 
apparently small hands. Much 
of Rubio’s campaign, for a few 
weeks, became centered on 
“out-Trumping” Trump, during 
debates, speeches and rallies.
What is unique about this 
situation is that Rubio felt 
remorse, 
acknowledged 
his 
poor conduct and apologized 
to Trump for his jokes and 
comments. Rubio said, “I don’t 
want to be that. If that’s what 
it takes to become president of 
the United States, then I don’t 
want to be president.” It is 
refreshing to see a politician 
realize 
their 
misconduct 
instead of sweeping it under the 
rug or blaming someone else, 
like Rubio easily could have 
done here instead of accepting 
and apologizing for it. It shows 
true class from a man who 
understands 
what 
personal 
responsibility is. Instead of 
dwelling on politicians and 
their misdeeds, we should first 
look upon ourselves and fix 
our own character. Once we 
have done that, then we will 
be able to hold elected officials 
accountable.
Take this lesson and apply 
it to your own life: the way 
you act, your work ethic, the 
way you treat people. Those 
things 
are 
all 
completely, 
unquestionably in your control. 
Don’t blame societal pressures, 
peer pressure, racism, sexism, 
tiredness, 
poverty, 
a 
busy 
schedule or anything else for 
disappointments or failures in 
your life. While these things 
can certainly, and often do, 
affect people in a myriad of 
serious ways, they do not 
determine anything on their 
own. The number one factor 

in every event in your life is 
you. Accept that and embrace 
it. It does yourself no favors 
to 
attribute 
the 
ability 
to 
determine the outcome of your 
life to any outside influence. 
Treat your life as if it is just 
that — yours. If you can do this, 
then you will be motivated to 
make the most of life’s many 
opportunities.
I understand that people 
don’t like to be told to “grow 
up” or to “take responsibility.” 
It sounds authoritative and, in 
a way, scary. I think, however, 
that it is an empowering idea 
that 
especially 
applies 
to 
many of us as aspiring young 
adults. 
Blaming 
supposed 
insurmountable

Imagine Dragons has, in spite 

of their remarkable commercial 
success, become a bit of a joke in 
recent years. Their first album, 
Night Visions, was pretty good, but 
everything they’ve released since 
has felt like the lifeless results of 
a 
machine-learning 
algorithm 

designed to appeal to people who 
drink a lot of Amp. Their previous 
album, Evolve, was particularly 
guilty of this syndrome, sounding 
like a bizarro version of Night 
Visions where every song sucked. 
So with Origins, I came in with 
low expectations.

The first half of the album is 

stronger, as Imagine Dragons 
floats with ease through pop 
clichés: a Phillip Phillips-esque 
folk pop revival on “West Coast,” 
electropop heavy with reverb 
on 
“Boomerang” 
and 
“Cool 

Out” and burning arena rock 
on “Machine.” By and large, 
these 
are 
well-executed 
and 

pleasant, if not remarkable. Dan 
Reynolds has a knack for catchy 
melodies, in particular soaring 
choruses. “Machine” is the best 
of this specific brand of ascendant 
commercial rock, a stomping 

groove 
inexorably 
marching 

towards the Billboard Top 40. 
“Bad Liar” is also a pretty strong 
cut, with one of the stickiest 
melodies on the album.

The second half of the album 

is much less enjoyable than the 

first. There are some moments of 
interest, but they fizzle out quickly. 
There’s “Love,” whose chorus 
sounds a little too similar to “I’m 
Yours” by Jason Mraz (but without 
the catchiness). In “Digital,” at one 
point, Dan starts yelling throatily 
over a hyperactive breakbeat 
drum loop, a development that is 
more surprising than good. At first 
I thought “Burn Out” would be a 
solid deep cut, and I kept waiting 
for the good part to kick in; it was 
only after the song ended did I 
realize that, in fact, there was no 
good part to be found.

Despite exceeding my low 

expectations, Origins is definitely 
subpar. Most of the songs on here 
will work well as music in car 
commercials or soundtracks to 
Fortnite compilations, but don’t 
have much musical value outside 

of that. They suffer from the 
same lifeless corporate flavor that 
has been permeating Imagine 
Dragons’s music since the It’s 
Time (EP), but at least they seem 
self-aware at this point. There’s 
really no reason to go out of your 
way to listen to Origins outside of a 
couple of decent cuts (“Machine,” 
“Bad Liar”) that you’ll probably 
end up hearing anyway during an 
ad for Regions Bank or something.

Imagine 
Dragons 
suffers 

from 
the 
same 
phenomenon 

Nickelback did a decade or so 
back — undeserved commercial 
success has led to undeserved 
critical backlash. While the music 
of these bands isn’t particularly 
good, the fact that they are the 
prominent butt of critical derision 
would make you believe they 
are much worse than they really 
are. Origins is commercial and 
inconsequential, but it is far from 
unpleasant or incompetent, and 
I’ve heard much worse music from 
bands that don’t get a fraction 
of the hate. The average person 
who doesn’t pay much attention 
to music probably really likes 
Imagine Dragons. To capture that 
audience range takes talent, and 
just because it doesn’t resonate 
with snobbish critics (like me), 
does not mean that it’s not of 
worth. 

Imagine Dragons’s latest 
is unsurprisingly subpar

Few shows so eloquently 

straddle the boundary between 
musical 
and 
operetta 
as 

“Candide,” Leonard Bernstein’s 
famed adaptation of Voltaire’s 
novel. This enigmatic work 
of theatre was first presented 
on Broadway before moving 
to opera houses, in which it 
has garnered great acclaim. 
Initially conceived by Bernstein 
and Lillian Hellman as a play 
with incidental music meant 
to satirize the hearings of the 
House Un-American Activities 
Committee, the work’s lyrics 
have 
since 
been 
modified 

by Stephen Sondheim, John 
LaTouche, Dorothy Parker and 
Richard Wilbur. 

Last weekend, “Candide” was 

performed by the University 
Opera 
Theatre 
and 
the 

University Symphony Orchestra 
at the Power Center. It was an 
enthralling journey through the 
life of Candide on his lengthy 
quest to marry Cunégonde. It 
was also a biting satire on the 
failures of organized religion, 
philosophy, war, money and 
socioeconomic class structure. 
Despite its antiquated setting, 
the work manages to remain 
frighteningly 
relevant. 
One 

can hear the echoes of modern 
political 
pessimism 
in 
the 

work’s criticism of 17th and 
18th century aristocratic power 
structures, the cries of anti-
party rhetoric reflected in the 
anti-government libretto.

After a quick introduction to 

the optimism that so consumed 
the philosophers of Voltaire’s 
day, the operetta oscillates 
between violence and lucky 
escape. 

To those unfamiliar with 

the book, the dark humor of 
this unrealistic plot can be 
hard to laugh at. Candide and 
his childhood friends travel all 
over the world, finding each 
other in the most unexpected 
of places and avoiding death 
by the narrowest of means. 
I found myself struggling to 
laugh with some members of 
the audience at the first scene 
of mass casualty before I, too, 

understood 
the 
unrealistic 

humor of this perpetual death 
and violence.

In the end, as the pace of the 

story slowed, the emotional 
poignancy began to overtake 
the dark humor. The final 
scene, in which Candide and 
Cunégonde agree to marry 
and to plant a garden together, 
was beautifully complex and 
emotionally ambiguous. “Life is 
neither good nor bad,” the choir 
sings. “Life is life, and all we 
know.” 

After this lengthy journey 

of faulty belief systems and 

strikingly immoral systems of 
cultural morality, the realist, 
almost nihilist simplicity of this 
resolution was astounding. The 
audience sat with rapt attention 
as Candide and Cunégonde 
exchanged promises to “do the 
best” they know in cultivating 
their garden and living a simple, 
agrarian life.

The simple ingenuity of the 

set contributed both to the 
fleeting absurdity of the plot 
and the poignant simplicity 
of the resolution. The entire 
operetta took place in front 
of a giant blackboard upon 
which Candide’s journey was 
illustrated in chalk. Smaller 
wheelable 
blackboards 

and 
simple 
wooden 
tables 

formed the changing scenery 
throughout 
the 
production 

while 
tablet-sized 
handheld 

blackboards formed the props. 
These handheld blackboards 
frequently contributed to the 
humor with characters on stage 

reacting in fright to blackboards 
with “GUN” written on them. 
In the end, as Candide and 
Cunégonde decide to pursue a 
simple lifestyle, the blackboard 
in the back of the stage was 
erased and the tabletops were 
removed to uncover small, lush 
gardens. 

The 
cast 
was 
quite 

impressive. They demonstrated 
the ease at which they sing 
English-language opera, and 
I found myself particularly 
impressed with the expressive 
singing of Candide and the 
colatura abilities of Cunégonde. 

With 
great 
choreography 

and 
significant 
dialogue, 
I 

began to question whether 
this was not better classified 
as a musical than an operetta. 
Bernstein’s career was based 
on the blending of genres: from 
the harmonic dissonance and 
operatic treatment of “West Side 
Story” to the popular influences 
in much of his concert music. 
And this work was no exception, 
with Bernstein jumping from 
dissonant incidental music to 
operatic arias and Broadway-
esque slow musical numbers.

I am always skeptical of 

movies and plays based on 
famous novels. To this end, I 
will admit that I was incredibly 
skeptical of Bernstein’s decision 
to adapt Voltaire’s novel. It 
would be hard, I thought, for the 
operetta to not be overshadowed 
by this incredibly influential 
novel. And though the overture 
is a staple of the American-
composed concert repertoire, 
I had assumed that there was 
a reason I was unfamiliar with 
the operetta. 

Yet despite my skepticism, 

the operetta lived up to the 
famed book after which it is 
based. Much like the book, it 
is a compelling criticism of 
wealth, power, religion and 
other constructs of cultural 
morality. 
And 
nothing 
felt 

more appropriate than the final 
words of the play, when Voltaire 
asks the audience if they have 
“Any questions?” For what is 
“Candide” if not a call for the 
audience to question, a proto-
Nietzschean condemnation of 
current belief systems in favor 
of a new belief system?

ALBUM REVIEW

Britney Spears will always be 

an object of fascination for me. 
Every time I go down a YouTube 
rabbit hole during slow nights 
in the comfort of my room, I 
always end up in the same place, 
watching early-aughts music 
videos until the sun comes up. 
From the fringed crop tops of 
Christina 
Aguilera’s 
“Genie 

in a Bottle” to the motorized 
pianos of Vanessa Carlton’s “A 
Thousand Miles,” the era is 
truly iconic in the span of starlet 
culture as a whole. But there’s 
one video, Spears’s “Lucky,” that 
has stamped itself permanently 
in the history of pop music. The 
first time I watched it, deep 
into one of these binge video 
consumptions, 
I 
was 
taken 

aback. It seems as if Spears had 
predicted her downfall seven 
years in the future, a toxic mix 
of fame and negligence that 
would result in drastic change.

The lyrics of “Lucky” serve 

as a bizarre look into the future 
of Spears’s career, and the video 
echoes this even more. The 
starlet looks on at a fictionalized 
version of herself, reaching out 
to a depressed Lucky as she 
puts on a smile for the cameras 
and cries until she falls asleep. 
Lucky is constantly looking into 
this tiny mirror throughout the 
video, trying to primp herself 
while sadness lurks behind 
her eyes. Though the song is 
supposedly a universal story of 
the dangers of fame, it seems 
to prophesize about Spears’s 
own breakdown in 2007, one 
that would be immortalized 
in pop culture forever. We’ve 
all seen the photos of her post-
buzzcut, of her walking around 
looking like a shell of herself as 
she reeled in the wake of losing 
custody of her children and an 
extreme downturn of her career. 
“If Britney survived 2007, you 
can survive today” is a sassy quip 
printed onto stickers and resting 
at the bottom of Instagram 

posts. But underneath “Lucky” 
and Spears’s story at large is the 
sad reality behind Hollywood’s 
treatment of young starlets, a 
history that has affected women 
in the industry for decades.

Though I was slightly too 

young to understand Britney 
Spears’s downfall and rebound 
in its full glory, people like 
Miley Cyrus and Lindsay Lohan 
served as examples of starlet 
culture and its dangers as I grew 
up. In fact, I wasn’t even allowed 
to listen to Britney as a kid 

because of how sexualized she 
was in the public eye, a pretty 
and perfect vision of feminine 
youth that found its way into the 
realm of Barbies and lunchboxes 
alike. My mother said that “Hit 
Me Baby One More Time” was 
vulgar for a six-year-old to be 
singing, and though I was angry 
at the time, I now agree with 
her in some ways. Our culture 
of idealism around these young 
girls forced them into boxes that 
were unrealistic and dangerous, 
placing them on a pedestal that 
was only waiting to crumble. In 
the past five years, many of the 
starlets of my childhood faced 
their own 2007s, trying to shed 
their sweetheart images with 
varying levels of success. 

I can remember when Miley 

Cyrus 
was 
photographed 

shirtless for Vanity Fair at 15, 

when she released “Can’t Be 
Tamed,” a video in which she 
prowls around a cage in skimpy, 
feathered clothing, when she 
danced around at the VMAs in 
nude spandex. I feel the same way 
about Cyrus’s reevolution that I 
do about that of Spears, both of 
them now seemingly happy and 
stable despite their struggles 
with fame. But there are those 
who weren’t so “Lucky” after 
all. Amanda Bynes’s battle with 
mistreatment by the industry 
and those around her resulted 
in a complete loss of self for the 
star. The fame machine sucks in 
and spits out young girls without 
giving them a note of how to 
navigate any of it all, and has 
since the days of Judy Garland. 
While money and power can 
come with the visibility of being 
a starlet, many of these girls 
lost themselves in that pursuit, 
groomed by handlers to remain 
marketable as they battled to 
form strong identities. 

We have no way of knowing 

if Britney Spears really felt 
the way that the character in 
“Lucky” does, but it’s easy to 
believe that she may have. “If 
there’s nothing missing in my 
life / Then why do these tears 
come at night?” she sings during 
the chorus, with the kind of 
bravado that seems true under 
the surface. At face value, the 
song 
and 
its 
accompanying 

video is a formulated example of 
pop perfection, but underneath 
it serves as a message of reality 
to what stardom’s consequences 
can bring. She might be lucky, 
but there’s something else there, 
lurking just under a pearly 
smile and immaculate makeup. 
As Hollywood slowly becomes 
more self aware, there’s a chance 
for more young girls to grow up 
famous and not fall apart. But 
for now, the lessons of Spears’s 
2000 song ring true: Even if you 
have everything, being a starlet 
is not all it’s chalked up to be.

She’s so lucky

Though deceivingly similar 

in their structure and sound, 
the concepts of loneliness and 
being alone are completely 
different. The distinguishing 
feature between the two is 
often the element of choice. We 
choose to be alone, isolating 
ourselves from the outside 
world when we need a moment 
to breath or a beat to reflect. 
But to be lonely is another story 
entirely. In his brief yet striking 
documentary, “Quiet Hours,” 
Paul Szynol softly captures 
the concept of “loneliness” 
through sound, image and 
color, demonstrating its quiet 
grief as a tiresome burden. 

Donald 
Hall 
is 
an 

80-something widower living 
alone 
in 
a 
house 
seeping 

with nostalgia of memories 
past. 
An 
American 
Poet 

Laureate, 
National 
Medal 

of Arts winner and former 
University professor, Hall is 
far past his glory days and put 

on vulnerable display for all 
to see. The film is composed 
of a mixture of flashbacks, 
juxtaposing Hall’s former life 
in the literary spotlight with his 
current day-to-day routines of 

mild aerobic exercise, grocery 
trips accompanied by one of 
his several female caretakers 
and painful reminiscence over 
his deceased wife and lifelong 
love, Jane Kenyon.

The back-and-forth between 

moments of the past and 
present 
have 
the 
intended 

effect of filling the viewer 
with a sense of sullenness and 
almost-pity for Hall. Hall’s 
acknowledgement 
of 
his 

wife’s passing 20 years prior 
is paired with a numb sense of 
acceptance that he will never 
find real light or joy again. 
This mood of numbness and 
gloom is intensified through 
the prominence of blues and 

greys in the film’s color palate 
and a minimal soundtrack. In 
fact, the main source of sound 
in the film, other than Hall’s 
own voice, comes from the 
repetitive dripping of a faucet, 
a figurative, blinking reminder 
that just as the tap continues 
to drip unceasingly, Hall will 
never move on from his wife’s 
passing. 

The one line of the film that 

best expresses its entirety is 
when Hall remarks that, “old 
age is a ceremony of losses.” The 
film is short, a mere 14 minutes 
long, yet it somehow manages 
to thoroughly personify this 
quote, crafting a strong sense 
of profundity and sympathy 
within viewers. Watching Hall 
onscreen, we can’t help but 
ponder the looming threat, 
not of aging, but of aging 
without 
companionship 
or 

love or something dear to us. 
By showcasing a man who has 
had so much success and joy 
in his life in such a solemn 
light, Syznol urges audiences 
to consider the “quiet place” 
that loneliness has the power 
to create within us all. 

‘Quiet Hours’ is a sullen

ANN ARBOR POLISH FILM FESTIVAL

“Quiet Hours”

Michigan Theater

 Itchy Dog Films

The chatter before a movie is 

always entertaining as people muse 
about the coming movie. This time, 
though, the people were talking in 
Polish as they waited for the start 
of “Cicha Noc,” or “Silent Night” in 
English.

The movie opens with a shaky 

shot from a home movie recorded 
by Adam (Dawid Ogrodnik, “Life 
Feels Good”) as he returns home 
to his family and wife. Doubt about 
Adam’s intentions is sewn into 
the audience with every awkward 
hug and interaction that suggest 
he hasn’t been with his family in a 
long time. “Silent Night” created 
refreshingly 
real 
relationships 

between each family member 
that are often lacking in typical 
holiday movies where families 
fight, but everything works out in 
the end. Each one was tinged with 
the lingering feeling that Adam 
used to be the beloved eldest son, 
the golden boy of the family. But 
as the movie progresses, things 
have obviously changed, causing 
the kind of dynamic tension that is 
often rampant throughout families. 

Predictably, “Silent Night” uses 

the iconic Christmas song as a theme 
throughout the movie. However, 
the name is also indicative of the 

way the film creates drama and 
pressure. In moments where some 
movies may have inserted yelling 
or whispered arguments, “Silent 
Night” was simply silent. Looks are 
exchanged and bodies are rigid, but 
there is no outright yelling. It is the 
kind of understated judgment that 
often comes from family members, 

and, when fighting does actually 
break out, it is a more dramatic, 
satisfying moment to watch the 
characters release their anger. 

On the other hand, the movie 

establishes a balance between the 
family bickering and the love that 
is often times hidden underneath 
all the disagreements. The key 
here was the shots from Adam’s 
home movie camera. The movie 
periodically moves between blue-
tinted and stable scenes of the story 
to the shaky, more realistic view 
of the handheld camera. Off-kilter 
shots and candid moments capture 
the true nature of the family and, 
at the end, “Silent Night” compiles 
all of the different clips from the 
night to remind the audience that, 
though family is frustrating, it is 
also an important part of our lives, 

and, despite evidence suggesting 
otherwise, family members do 
what they do out of love.

“Silent Night” also touches on 

other subjects, such as abusive 
relationships, 
with 
Jolka 
— 

Adam’s 
sister 
(Maria 
Debska, 

“These Daughters of Mine) — and 
her husband, or the fight with 
alcoholism that plagues his father 
(Arkadiusz Jakubik, “The Art of 
Loving”) and mother (Agnieszka 
Suchora, “Off the Stretcher”). 
There is a quick nod to racial 
tensions between those of Polish 
descent and the rest of Europe that 
is meant to explain Adam’s father’s 
reasoning for wanting to keep his 
son in Poland, but that feels a little 
forced, thrown into the end of the 
movie. Kasia, Adam’s youngest 
sister 
(Amelia 
Tyszkiewicz, 

“Planeta Singli”), is really the 
only put-together character in the 
whole movie and plays an integral 
in keeping the family grounded, 
reminding them of the growing up 
they all have to do. 

One of the feature films of 

Ann Arbor’s 25th annual Polish 
Film Festival, “Silent Night” is a 
typical dramatization of the family 
tension that runs so high during 
the holiday season. It captures the 
diverse experiences that, though 
unique to each family in detail, are 
often universal in nature and is an 
entertaining experience. 

In ‘Cicha Noc,’ the holidays 
heighten familial tensions

“Universam Grochów”
Tomasz 
Knittel’s 

documentary 
chronicling 

the life span of Universam 
Grochów, a supermarket in 
Warsaw, is not pretty, and it 
doesn’t try to be. However, 
such directorial prudence is 
the exception rather than the 
rule in “Universam Grochów.” 
The 
filmmakers 
boldly 

endeavor to render a seemingly 
unextraordinary supermarket 
worthy 
of 
a 
documentary, 

but their argument in favor 
of 
Universam 
Grochów’s 

importance is never adequately 

developed. So while audience 
members may remain intrigued 
by the compelling but disjointed 
scenes, they never know enough 
to feel persuaded.

Some of the arrangements 

of scenes in the film work. For 
instance, it shows its audience 
Universam 
Grochów 
first 

through the eyes of one of its 
most 
loyal 
employees, 
and 

then through a historical lens. 
This ordering of encounters 
with 
the 
supermarket 
— 

subjective 
first, 
objective 

second — successfully initiates 
the 
filmmakers’ 
argument 

in favor of the supermarket’s 
unlikely notability. Some of 
the 
interviews, 
especially 

with 
a 
younger 
shopper, 

further develop this argument. 
In 
several 
segments 
of 

her 
interview 
interwoven 

throughout the documentary, 
this younger shopper makes 
a 
fascinating 
argument: 
A 

person’s possessions have an 
immortalizing 
function,

perhaps they do not merely 
outlive their owners but allow 
their owners to live on in them.

Other arrangements in the 

film, however, simply don’t 
work, 
undermining 
those 

that do. For instance, the 
documentarians 
only 
hint 

intermittently at the historical 
importance of the supermarket, 
which 
is 
an 
especially 

surprising absence given the 
context of Poland’s history 
of communism. As another 
example, several transitional 

montages are set to the songs 
of a troubadour who performs 
regularly 
just 
outside 
the 

supermarket, but the film does 
not dive into the questions his 
role in the film raises (e.g. as an 
outsider, as a man struggling 
financially). By and large, the 
filmmakers place an inordinate 
portion of the burden of forging 
connections between scenes on 
their audience.

On 
top 
of 
that, 
mere 

accumulation of scenes that 
address the documentarians’ 
driving question does little 
to advance an argument, and 
this 
disconnect 
will 
likely 

confuse and frustrate viewers. 
He’s talented, but why are you 
showing me the troubadour 
who 
sings 
outside 
the 

marketplace? Their dialogue 
is vivacious, but why do you 
keep showing me the elderly 
women gossiping before they 
shop? Such questions run the 
risk of congealing into the last 
question a documentarian ever 
wants to hear their audience 
ask: 
Why 
does 
this 
topic 

warrant a documentary?

The closing sequence of the 

film summarizes the missed 
potential 
of 
“Universam 

Grochów.” The documentary 
captures the life span of the 
beloved supermarket, so the 
finale rightly showcases its 
closing — its death, so to 
speak. The scene can only be 
described as a supermarket’s 
memorial, 
complete 
with 

a crowd of mourners and a 
eulogy delivered by the same 
adoring employee who opened 
the film. If the filmmakers 
had 
committed 
more 
fully 

to 
personifying 
Unviersam 

Grochów, perhaps this scene 
would 
have 
felt 
climactic 

instead of disconcertingly cult-
like. And perhaps audiences 
would have felt something 
other than bewilderment with 
respect to the subject of this 
documentary, too.

“A Sky without Stars”
How does a father love 

his 
son? 
Let 
Katarzyna 

Dabkowska-Kułacz (“Between 
the Worlds”) count the ways. 
For while in theory, her majestic 
documentary “A Sky without 
Stars” is about Robert, father 
of five-year-old Gabriel, losing 
his sense of sight, the father’s 
disability never overshadows 
the father-son relationship at 
its crux. What results from 
these 
fastidious 
efforts 
on 

Dabkowska-Kułacz’s part is a 
testament to the strength and 
adaptability 
humans 
claim 

when buoyed by unconditional 
love.

The opening sequence alone 

accounts for the luminescence 
of this documentary. In this 
sequence, we witness multiple 
incarnations of the impossible 
tenderness 
between 
Robert 

and his son. Perhaps the most 
stunning among these opening 
scenes captures the two seated 
in their backyard swing set, 
Robert cradling Gabe while 
Gabe puts eyedrops in his own 
eyes.

Aside from its beauty, this 

scene introduces two points 
Dabkowska-Kułacz 
develops 

throughout 
the 
remainder 

of her film. On one hand, it 
addresses a harsh reality the 
documentary does not shy away 
from yet still approaches with 

ample 
compassion: 
Robert’s 

disease is genetic, and his son 
will likely lose his vision the 
same way his father has. We also 
see in this scene that Robert’s 
relationship with his son would 
be 
better 
approximated 
by 

the term “partnership.” Five-
year-old Gabe, is, of course, 
dependent on his father. As 
Robert’s vision deteriorates, 
however, he becomes more 
dependent on Gabe. But as 
the abundant affection in the 
scene illustrates, neither of the 
two see their codependence 
as weakness; instead, it is 
portrayed as an incomparable 
source of strength.

Though 
“A 
Sky 
without 

Stars” sets a high bar for itself 
with this opening sequence, the 
film hardly ever departs from 
that standard. An example 
of a subsequent triumph of 
the film lies in the singular 
sensory experience it forges. 
In several shots, the camera 
is claustrophobically close to 
Robert and Gabe, so we see 
them only in part but hear them 

in full. In a display of directorial 
wisdom, 
Dabkowska-Kułacz 

appreciates 
that 
there 
are 

times when it is more effective 
to speak through silences. In 
a 
particularly 
heartrending 

scene 
following 
a 
checkup 

with his doctor, Robert is 
filmed undertaking a vigorous 
exercise routine. The subtext 
is that in a previous scene, his 
doctor recommended exercise 
to prolong his ability to see after 
Robert lamented the prospect 
of never being able to see his 
son’s face again. Dabkowska-
Kułacz is wise enough to let 
the 
emotional 
complexity 

contained in this scene speak 
for itself.

These 
sensory 
overloads 

and 
deprivations 
remind 

able-bodied 
viewers 
not 

only how much they take for 
granted but also how much 
Robert maintains despite his 
disability. In a prime example, 
Dabkowska-Kułacz 
lets 
the 

sound of Gabe’s laughter steals 
several scenes, reinforcing the 
fact that nothing can steal that 
sound from his father.

The same can be said of 

the unrelenting love viewers 
witness every second of the 
film. Highlighting this love, “A 
Sky without Stars” radiates its 
own inimitable light.

‘Universam’ bewilders, 
and ‘A Sky without Stars’ 
radiates with love & light

The Michigan football team dropped its season opener to Notre 
Dame, falling to the No. 12 Fighting Irish, 24-17. Since then, the 
Wolverines have rolled through their next nine games undefeated. 
Now ranked fourth, Michigan will host the Hoosiers in its final home 
game of the 2018 season. After that, the Wolverines will travel two 
hours south to Columbus, where they’ll face Ohio State in their final 
game before the postseason.

What to watch for ahead of the Wolverines 
matchup with Indiana on Saturday.

Behind Enemy Lines: Founder of Hoosier 
Network and WIUX caster Eddie Cotton

With College Football Playoff 
hopes, the No. 4 Michigan football 
team (7-0 Big Ten, 9-1 overall) is 
looking for that top-four spot in 
the Cotton Bowl or Orange Bowl. 
Indiana (2-5, 5-5) needs a win just 
to be bowl eligible.
Though the two teams have 
vastly different season trajectories, 
the narratives have largely been 
left to the wayside in their matchup 
since 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
started 
coaching 
the 
Wolverines.
In 
2015, 
Michigan 
escaped 
Bloomington 
with 
a 
48-41 
shootout victory 
in 
double 
overtime. 
The 
following 
year 
sang a different 
tune, with the 
Wolverines 
winning, 20-10, 
in 
the 
snow. 
And last season, another overtime 
game in favor of Michigan. While 
this year projects to be a blowout, 
the past says otherwise.
The Daily spoke with Eddie 
Cotton, a founder of The Hoosier 
Network 
and 
broadcaster 
for 
WIUX, to learn about Indiana’s 
challenges 
and 
opportunities 
ahead of Saturday’s game at 
Michigan Stadium.
The Michigan Daily: From 
a pure record standpoint, has 
Indiana performed above, at or 
below expectations?
Eddie Cotton: Oh God, that’s 
a tough question. I would say at 
expectations. 
The 
expectation 
every season at this point for 
Indiana football is 6-6. If you go 
6-6, that’s kind of a win because 
bowl games are not exactly rich in 
the program’s history. So the fact 
that the program has two games 
remaining and is one win away 
from a bowl game is exactly the 
expectation. 
Potentially 
better 
than expectations, but the way 
that it’s happen has been kind of 
poor.
TMD: Given where the team is 
at right now, where do you think 
the fanbase stands with Tom Allen 
in his second year?

EC: I think there are two sides 
of the coin. The more radical 
Indiana fan is genuinely frustrated 
with Tom Allen. There were 
calls for him to get fired after the 
Minnesota game, which to me is 
absurd because he’s in his second 
season. But there are concerns 
because he’s never been a head 
coach before this and he’s made 
some mistakes in terms of game 
management and head coaching 
type things. But the rational fan 
understands it’s only his second 
year, he brought in one of the best 
recruiting classes Indiana has 
brought in last year. That’s why 
we’ve seen so many young players 
playing for Indiana and why there 
are reasons for hope — all the 
players that are vital for Indiana 
are so young and will be here for 
a few years. Especially with the 
quarterback 
situation. 
Michael 
Penix looks like a star, he’s out for 
the season, but he’ll get a redshirt. 
The rational fan looks at that and 
is okay with it and sees that Tom 
Allen still has potential.
TMD: Coming off a win against 
Maryland, what has the vibe 
been around the team this week 

being one game away from bowl 
eligibility? Do they sound like a 
hungrier team?
EC: I don’t know what to say 
about the vibe out of the team. I 
can say the vibe of the coach has 
been very adamant about that 
sixth win. He said after the last 
win against Maryland that they 
absolutely squeaked out, Tom 
was very adamant that they knew 
how much the win was because 
it was all about a bowl game, so 
that kind of pushed them to win. 
The fan base themselves are more 
self-deprecating about it. They’re 
kinda just like “Yeah, yeah this 
season is kinda over.”
TMD: Michigan opened as 
26.5-point favorites. Do you agree 
or disagree with that spread?
EC: I disagree with that spread 
because Indiana historically, as 
in just the recent history, has 
kept it close against Michigan, 
Ohio State, Penn State and then 
completely lost it in the third and 
fourth quarter. Indiana will do 
the same thing again and keep it 
close for a half, and stay within 26 
points.
TMD: 
Two 
overtimes 
and 

a 10-point game the past three 
meetings. 
Even 
with 
talent 
mismatches, can you pinpoint a 
particular reason why this game 
can be competitive? 
EC: They can stay competitive 
in this game because it’s a trap 
game. Realistically, it’s easy to 
overlook Indiana and then you 
start playing them in real life and 
it’s like “Hey, they’re not that 
bad.” To stay competitive in this 
game, they’ll need to be aggressive 
offensively, which I don’t think 
they will be. If (quarterback) 
Peyton Ramsey doesn’t make any 
mistakes, seemingly he’s very 
good at being conservative and 
managing a game, they can stick 
around.
TMD: For an offense largely 
dependent on Ramsey and running 
back Stevie Scott, how do you think 
they will fare against Michigan’s 
defense? 
EC: Not great. You mention 
Stevie Scott and Indiana has this 
issue where they seem statistically 
to rely on Stevie Scott. But every 
big game they play against a good 
run defense, they give up on the 
run after about eight carries. I 

think Scott had about 11 carries 
against Ohio State, and against 
Michigan State he didn’t touch 
it more than five times. It’s a bit 
hyperbolic, but once the second 
half came they stopped running 
the football. Don’t be surprised if 
Michigan’s defense forces Indiana 
to throw the football downfield 
five yards every play.
TMD: Indiana doesn’t have a 
strong pass defense, but the run 
game is more of Michigan’s bread 
and butter. Who do you think their 
x-factor is offensively?
EC: The whole key is (Karan) 
Higdon. The biggest problem for 
Indiana defensively all year has 
been being able to handle RPO, 
because they don’t have the man-
to-man talent. If Michigan can 
establish Higdon early, then the 
idea of just having Higdon on 
a play-action play — or maybe 
his running will force Indiana’s 
defense into situations that they’re 
not comfortable with, because 
they have no idea what they’re 
doing in an RPO situation. 
TMD: Prediction?
EC: 27-13 Michigan. It feels 
right. It’s on the books.

JON RUNYAN JR. is staring down pressure - 
just as always.
KATELYN MULCAHY/DAILY

DESIGN BY KATE GLAD

ETHAN WOLFE / DAILY SPORTS WRITER

EVAN AARON / DAILY

Jon Runyan Jr. was a household 

name among the Michigan 

offensive line. But along that 

front, being talked about is 

everything to avoid.

Runyan 
was 
the 
obvious 

scapegoat after the redshirt 

junior’s first collegiate start 

at left tackle Sept. 1 at Notre 

Dame. 
Michigan’s 
offensive 

line wholly struggled keeping 

its flashy, new quarterback 

upright. 
His 
shortcomings 

headlined the Wolverines’ only 

loss to date.

Runyan, 
one 
of 
two 
new 

starters on offense, got the 

preponderance of flack.

During 
Jim 
Harbaugh’s 

Monday 
press 
conference 

following the game, he fielded 

four questions about offensive 

line play. Harbaugh said his 

line 
looked 
improved 
and 

expressed confidence in his 

starting 
five. 
Elsewhere, 

Runyan and the rest of his line 

were pilloried. Messages from 

angry fans flooded Runyan’s 

social media profiles, and there 

was plenty more said indirectly 

about his play.

“It was difficult, there were 

people coming after me from 

all angles,” Runyan said. “For 

two or three weeks after the 

Notre Dame game, I put my 

phone down and took (social 

media) off my phone and tried 

not to pay attention to it.”

He remembers the number of 

fans who directly messaged him 

online with harsh criticisms — 

four people on Facebook, five 

on Twitter, 10 on Instagram.

As much as Runyan attempted 

to avoid that noise and move on, 

he still knew his performance 

wasn’t adequate.

“It was a little bit rough, and I 

told him right after the game,” 

said his father, Jon Runyan 

Runyan can point to the exact moment 

things changed for him this year.

It was on an outside zone play during 

Michigan’s second drive on week four 

against Nebraska. Runyan pinned his 

matchup and knocked the Cornhusker 

defensive end backwards and into the 

ground 
before 
Karan 
Higdon 
even 

approached the line of scrimmage. And 

when Higdon did, Runyan and junior guard 

Ben Bredeson had created such a massive 

gap opening to nothing but turf — and the 

endzone — in front of the senior running 

back.

“Ever since then, I’ve really started feeling 

good in the left tackle spot in the run and 

pass game,” Runyan said. “I can really 

narrow it down to that play.”

It was a welcome realization for Runyan, 

beyond performing at a career-best level. 

His first career start was in the Outback 

Bowl loss last season. The three games 

after falling short in a prove-yourself start 

in South Bend stood to mend a broken 

reputation. 
Breaking 
through 
against 

Nebraska displayed what being a collegiate 

standout could be like.

Runyan pinpoints that game as when 

the switch flipped. But the ghosts of the 

season opener still find themselves cozy in 

Runyan’s mind. Through four more weeks 

without a hiccup in his play, including 

benchmark wins against Wisconsin and 

Michigan State, Runyan took time to look 

directly into his mistakes.

He was off to the film room.

“And going back into it, I watched that 

because it was during the bye week,” 

Runyan said. “I just wanted to remind 

myself where I started and where I’m going 

to go, and how I don’t want to have that 

feeling anymore that I had with the Notre 

Dame game.”

With two weeks left in the regular season, 

the feeling hasn’t seemed to return. 

Through 10 weeks, Higdon is the first 

Michigan running back to reach 1,000 

yards since 2011. Junior quarterback Shea 

Patterson has only been sacked once a game 

on average, and boasts the second best 

passer rating in the Big Ten.

First year offensive line coach Ed Warinner 

has garnered much of the praise for the 

resurgence of an oft-criticized front. The 

simplification of schemes that Warinner 

has introduced have been crucial according 

to Runyan. Warinner just calls it focusing 

on each of the lineman’s strengths.

“We ask him to do what he’s really good at 

and do it really hard,” Warinner said. “And 

so that’s made him a very confident player. 

There’s nothing more defeating as a player 

than to ask me to do something I know he 

can’t do.”

Fans can surely look for a scapegoat, but 

there isn’t one.

***

Jon Runyan Sr. was known for his 

roughhouse attitude on the field.

His son being bullied by the Fighting Irish 

could certainly besmirch the family name. 

But Runyan Jr.’s skill sets vary from his 

father’s; it’s consistently reinforced.

“As a parent, you understand the pressure, 

how he’s going to compare,” Runyan Sr. 

said. “But I feel he has his head on straight. 

He blazes his own trail, and we’re all 

different and we have different talents. I’ve 

told him since he was in high school, he is a 

better athlete than I was.”

Added Runyan Jr.: “My dad was known as 

one of the nastiest people. I try to emulate 

that watching little clips of him knocking 

Michael Strahan down. I don’t know if I’m 

there, but hopefully I’ll be able to get there.”

In his fourth season, walking back-and-

forth in front of images of his father 

plastered in Schembechler Hall, the road 

following his father’s legacy seems to be 

winding down.

Contingent on College Football Playoff or 

Big Ten championship success, Runyan 

Jr. could be known just for anchoring the 

left side of the line.

He isn’t his father, and that doesn’t 

bother him. He’s been berated in high 

school because of it, despite success. He 

was put on a stake after Notre Dame, and 

silenced critics for the next 11 weeks.

It doesn’t mean the pressure of being a 

Runyan is gone. It just means Jon Runyan 

Jr. is being himself.

“This name kinda carries a lot of weight,” 

Runyan Jr. said. “I’m proud to have it, 

and I don’t pay too much attention to 

what everybody says about me. I received 

a lot of criticism from people on the 

outside after the Notre Dame game. But 

my father was right there backing me 

up. A bunch of my friends I went to high 

school with, my teammates, they would 

lift me up.

“We’ve been having a good season, and 

those people talking trash about us at the 

beginning (have) all come crawling back 

like, ‘Oh, maybe this offensive line is 

good. Maybe Juwann Bushell-Beatty, Jon 

Runyan Jr. are good tackles.’ I just take it 

all with a grain of salt.

“I don’t really care. I just stay level-

headed and don’t let it faze me at all.”

Daily 
Sports 
Editor 
Mark 
Calcagno 

contributed to the reporting of this story.

Sr. “He played high because he wasn’t 

used to it. (He needed) better footwork, 

footwork with purpose so he didn’t have 

to rely on his athletic ability to recover.”

Added the younger Runyan: “I felt sick 

because, going back and watching it, it 

was just kinda a bad grade — like you 

don’t want to show your parents. But you 

know that it’s there and they’re going 

to find out. You try to hide from them 

but you can’t because you know that it’s 

there.”

For 
most 
student-athletes, 
parental 

advice is complementary to the day-to-

day grind. When your father is a former 

All-American 
lineman 
at 
Michigan, 

NFL Pro Bowler and New Jersey state 

representative, the advice is gospel.

So with Runyan Jr. finding himself on 

the wrong end of football commentary, 

change was needed — an especially tall 

order for a veteran.

But it wasn’t an unusual task. 

***

Behind the fame of his father, he’s been 

doing it his whole football life.

He starred as an offensive lineman 

at 
St. 
Joseph’s 
Preparatory 
High 

School in Philadelphia, catalyzing an 

offensive line and team that celebrated 

two Pennsylvania Interstate Athletic 

Association state championships.

It was a drop in the bucket for Runyan.

“Jon, despite coming from a dad with 

such success, was a shy kid,” said his high 

school coach, Gabe Infante. “I think it 

was really big shoes to fit into. I think 

everyone expects a young man like that 

to be his father from the moment he steps 

on a football field. But Jon was like any 

other 14- or 15-year old kid: basically a 

boy trapped in a man’s body.”

No 
accolades 
would 
help 
Runyan 

escape the shadow cast by his father. 

Not coaches’ visits, state titles or even 

the popularity of being attached with 

football notoriety.

The weight of the last name on the back 

of his jersey was an insult flung in the 

middle of games, a foot-in-the-door for 

an opponent’s animus.

“People like to talk about me as a 

sophomore, junior in high school how 

I’d never live up to my dad,” Runyan 

said, reflecting on a Catholic League 

championship game. “Stuff like that just 

in the game. It didn’t confuse me, but it 

kinda angered me. Coach Infante was 

always there telling me that I’m not my 

dad, I’m my own person. It’s not fair to 

judge someone like me going off what my 

dad has done.

“Judge me off what I’m doing, not what 

— like I’m my own measuring stick. 

You don’t have to measure me up to my 

dad because he’s a completely different 

person and player than me.”

To 
call 
it 
a 
burden 
would 
be 
a 

mischaracterization. He plays in the 

footsteps of his very father after all. 

Winning can solve problems, too.

It seems like an obvious observation: the 

son of Jon Runyan Sr. is not Jon Runyan 

Sr., and that’s not a bad thing. The sooner 

that Runyan Jr. reconciled that, the more 

he stood out on his own.

Partridge feeling right at home 
in fourth season with Michigan

Chris Partridge didn’t know 
Jim Harbaugh when he was 
hired.
Partridge 
had 
coached 
college football before, at his 
alma mater, Lafayette College, 
and at The Citadel, but prior to 
joining the Michigan football 
team, he spent the five seasons 
in 
the 
high-school 
ranks, 
coaching 
Paramus 
Catholic 
High School in New Jersey.
The huge amount of success 
Partridge had in those years 
— he estimates they had 17 
Division I athletes on the 
roster his last season — was 
enough to get him noticed. It 
was also enough to give him 
the feeling that it was time to 
move on.
That’s 
when 
a 
mutual 
friend got Partridge in touch 
with Wolverines coach Jim 
Harbaugh.
“Tom 
Gamble, 
who 
is 
coincidentally 
working 
here now, was working for 
(Harbaugh) 
at 
the 
49ers,” 
Partridge told The Daily on 
Nov. 7. “… And then, so, Jim 
got the job here, and Tom said, 
‘Hey, I’m gonna call him and 
see if he needs somebody, you 
know, out of the high school 
ranks.’
“… And then, just one day, 
Jim just called me on the cell 
phone.”
That was that. Partridge 
flew out for an interview and 
was hired as the director of 
player personnel in recruiting.
The move made sense. It was 
as meteoric a rise as Partridge 
could have expected at that 
time, and it put someone who 
was familiar with the New 
Jersey recruiting pipeline in a 
primary recruiting position.
A season later, Partridge got 
a promotion to the coaching 
staff, becoming the linebackers 
coach. At that same time, 
Harbaugh’s 
investment 
in 
Partridge 
paid 
off 
on 
the 
recruiting trail.
The No. 1 player in the 2016 
recruiting class, Rashan Gary, 

committed to Michigan that 
season. He had played high 
school at Paramus Catholic.
“It played a role, I feel like, 
in terms of being comfortable 
and having a familiar face — 
having somebody to talk to,” 
Gary said of Partridge’s role in 
his commitment.
“But I told Rashan, and I told 
his mother, that, you know, I’m 
at Michigan, but I’m not going 
to try to guide you anywhere,” 
Partridge added.
“You know, I’m gonna be 
there as a support, because 
I’ve known you prior. And 
with Michigan, yeah, you come 

up, you visit, you meet with 
everybody else, and I’m just 
gonna try to guide that decision 
wherever 
it 
might be. So I 
really never gave 
them this hard 
sell or anything 
like that. I just 
tried 
to 
give 
them facts.”
In 
part 
because of Gary’s 
commitment, 
Partridge 
was 
named the 2016 
Recruiter of the Year by Scout. 
The next season, Partridge 

won the same distinction from 
247Sports.
It was no coincidence, then, 
that 
Partridge 
helped 
develop 
a 
strong 
base 
of players from 
New Jersey.
VIPER Jabrill 
Peppers 
and 
offensive tackle 
Juwann Bushell-
Beatty 
came 
to 
Michigan 
the year before 
Partridge’s 
arrival, and though they didn’t 
play for Partridge per say, 

there are seven New Jerseyans 
other than Gary and Bushell-
Beatty on the 2018 roster.
“He values family,” Gary 
told The Daily. “I don’t look at 
him as a coach. I look at him 
as one of my family members. 
And, you know, he values 
family a lot. And when you’re 
around family, it makes you 
comfortable. So I feel like me 
coming here with Juwann and 
before when Jabrill was here, 
it’s just a whole big family. We 
still have a lot of guys from 
Jersey, so that whole Jersey 
group, we’re all together as

family.”
That’s 
an 
aspect 
of 
his 
coaching that Partridge, now 
the safeties coach and special 
teams coordinator, takes pride 
in — and it stretches beyond the 
players from the Garden State.
Fifth-year 
senior 
safety 
Tyree 
Kinnel 
watches 
film 
with Partridge every Sunday. 
Another group of players meets 
with Partridge at 7:30 a.m.
The conversations are about 
football, sure, but Partridge 
says he feels he has a bigger 
responsibility 
than 
simply 
coaching Xs and Os. He feels he 
needs to “guide” his players.
“We either talk about family 
or football when it’s me and 
him,” Kinnel said. “That’s the 
thing I love about him.”
“I remember last week, a 
couple weeks ago, I talked to 

him, like, three times in one 
week and it didn’t matter,” added 
Gary. “We were here late night 
talking about personal things 
going on and how I should feel 
about that and what I should do 
to make me feel better.”
The 
closeness 
Partridge 
has 
with 
his 
players came in 
handy this past 
offseason.
Alabama came 
calling, 
and 
rumors suddenly 
swirled 
about 
the 
potential 
of 
Partridge 
departing 
for 
greener pastures.
“I 
didn’t 
want 
that,” 
Partridge 
said. 
“Especially since my intent was 
always to stay here. You know, 
you don’t want people to say, 
‘He’s looking to leave,’ or, ‘He’s 
looking 
around.’ 
Obviously 

there’s a component to your 
career and your path there, but, 
you know, I always felt that, 
with guys like Rashan, guys that 
I’ve recruited, I wanted to stick 
it out for that and not just jump.
“Because, in reality, we can 
do anything we want to do here. 
What’s the reason 
to go somewhere 
else.”
Gary 
heard 
the rumors too, 
and at first, he 
was 
concerned. 
But 
Partridge 
assured Gary of 
his intentions to 
stay. 
With 
the 
trust the two had 
built up to that 
point, there was no real reason 
for Gary to doubt him.
“He loves us, and we love 
him,” Gary said. “He feels like 
it’s family here, so there’s no 
reason to leave family.”

Even prior to that, when 
Partridge first got the call from 
the Crimson Tide, he felt he 
needed to tell one person right 
away: Harbaugh.
The coach had taken a chance 
on Partridge four years earlier. 
As Partridge puts it, he deserved 
the 
respect 
it 
took to go to him 
before 
doing 
anything else.
“(He was) like, 
‘Hey, great. This 
is really good for 
you. 
It’s 
great 
for your career,’ 
” 
Partridge 
said. “I think I 
remember, I said, 
‘Hey, do you want 
me to stay here?’ And he said 
yes, and that was the end of it. 
You know, Jim is really good, 
because you feel like you can 
go talk to him about something 
like that, and you feel like he’s 

going to guide you in the right 
way, whether it’s the best way 
for him or not.
“… I think that’s one of the 
things I respect the most out of 
him.”
Perhaps that’s what made 
Partridge and Harbaugh — and 
Michigan 
by 
proxy — a match 
made in heaven.
Harbaugh 
commands 
the 
respect 
of 
his 
coaches by being 
approachable. 
That same style 
can be seen in 
Partridge. 
In 
his 
recruiting, 
coaching 
and 
relationship-building.
Maybe that’s why all it took 
for Partridge to prove a good 
enough fit for the program was 
a mutual friend and a phone 
call.

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily
Junior defensive end Rashan Gary says Chris Partridge has made Michigan easier on him because “(Partridge) loves us, and we love him. He feels like it’s family here, so there’s no reason to leave family.”

What to Watch For: Indiana

It’s the game before The Game.
To most, Indiana is but a 
nameless, faceless blip on this 
path inevitably destined for a 
clash next Saturday. This game 
holds little big-picture meaning 
so long as the Michigan football 
team takes care of business and 
emerges with its health intact.
This is college football, though. 
Crazier things have happened 
— crazier things happen nearly 
every week — which helps bring 
into focus Michigan’s laser-like, 
week-to-week external mentality. 
Next week means far, far less if 
the Wolverines don’t beat the 
Hoosiers on Saturday.
Here’s what you should be 
watching for in a game most 
expect to be a rout:
1) Health 
There are real pre-emptive 
measures the coaches can (and 
will) take to ensure maximal 
health for next Saturday. For one, 
as was the case last week, junior 

quarterback Shea Patterson almost 
assuredly will not be running the 
ball — or taking any unnecessary 
hits. 
Patterson 
getting 
hurt 
against a .500 Indiana team would 
either be a result of tremendously 
bad unluck or malpractice.
That being said, football is 
football. 
Players 
have 
instincts 
they can’t — and 
shouldn’t — simply 
turn off. As in 
most 
games, 
a 
player might leave 
the game in the 
second 
quarter 
and questions will 
fly about why he 
was still playing. 
Things 
happen. 
For Michigan, emerging from this 
game as healthy as possible is the 
top priority ahead of next week’s 
showdown. 
2) Can Indiana move the ball?
Ah, the matter of the game. 
There will be football played 
Saturday, and if the players and 
coaches are to be believed, it has 

their undivided attention. Indiana 
isn’t the pushover Rutgers was — 
nor quite the challenge Michigan 
State or Penn State presented on 
paper. After last week’s 34-32 win 
over Maryland, the Hoosiers are 
averaging 31 points over their last 
three games. In that span, Indiana 
quarterback 
Peyton 
Ramsey 
has 
thrown 
for 
711 
yards 
and 
five 
touchdowns, 
while completing 
66 percent of his 
passes.
Partially 
a 
product 
of 
a 
weaker 
defense, 
the Hoosiers are 
just 1-2 in that 
span. Still, this is an offense 
capable 
of 
stringing 
together 
chunks — and points — if Michigan 
has one eye on next week already. 
The top-ranked defense in the 
country should have no problems 
taking care of Indiana.
But 
again, 
crazier 
things 
happen.

3) An early lull?
It’s cliche, sure. And if you 
listen to 10 seconds of what this 
coaching staff is saying — or have 
watched this team play all year 
— it seems outlandish. But we’re 
talking about 18-22 year-old kids 
one week away from one of the 
biggest games of their lives.
Indiana has two conference 
wins. The Wolverines are 23-4 
in the Harbaugh era. The line for 
this game appears to be settling 
around four touchdowns.
All of this creates a presumption 
that has undoubtedly seeped into 
the players. Whether they pay 
it mind is certainly a different 
question; but there’s no doubt 
they’re thinking about what a win 
over Ohio State would mean, what 
a Big Ten title would mean. It’s 
human nature.
It seems likely that will be 
evident, one way or another, early 
on. If Michigan starts slow, that 
could indicate an unexpectedly 
ardous afternoon. If not, the 
“Revenge Tour” party bus should 
cruise onto Columbus.

4) Tarik Black’s emergence?
Barring 
disaster, 
Michigan 
is going to go to Columbus next 
week at near full strength. Two 
weeks 
ago, 
fifth-year 
senior 
Chase Winovich referred to the 
Wolverines as a, “battleship,” in 
saying how they plan to go to Ohio 
State.
Well, that battleship is nearing 
full ammo.
Sophomore wide receiver Tarik 
Black returned to the field two 
weeks ago against Penn State, 
catching a touchdown that was 
nullified by a penalty. He hasn’t 
officially caught a pass yet. If he 
is able to reach the form expected 
out of him — the form seen in short 
windows between injuries during 
his career — that battleship will 
look all the more terrifying. 
This would be the week to 
re-integrate 
Black 
fully 
with 
fellow sophomore receivers Nico 
Collins and Donovan Peoples-
Jones, a real chance to continue 
to smooth that rapport between 
Black and Patterson in what will 
likely be a blowout victory.

KATELYN MULCAHY/Daily
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh will likely rest or protect his players when possible on Saturday to avoid potential injury ahead of the Wolverines’ biggest game of the season against Ohio State.
