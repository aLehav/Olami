Michigan beats
OSU by over 300
pints in 32nd
annual competition
By TANAZ AHMED
Daily StaffReporter
Though Team 134 lost The
Game Saturday, Michigan
claimed one victory against rival
Ohio State University.
The 32nd annual Blood Battle
competition against OSU came
to an end Friday with a sanguine
win for the University.
In 2012, OSU won the Blood
Battle, breaking the University's
previous record of four con-
secutive wins. The University
collected 2,575 pints of blood -
about 300 more pints than the
Buckeyes.
The University also won the
competition for organ and bone
marrow donor signups, beat-

ing OSU by more than 60,000
organ donation pledges and
200 more bone marrow donor
commitments. Overall, Blood
Drives United, a student-run
service organization that coor-
dinates the Blood Battle, found
103,286 organ donors for Gift of
Life Michigan, the state's organ
donor list and 300 bone marrow
donors for the Be the Match Reg-
istry.
Blood Drives United began
collecting donations on Nov. 4 at
stations sponsored by the Ameri-
can Red Cross. The drive contin-
ued daily at various locations on
campus, including the Michigan
Union and Michigan Stadium, to
meet the goal of 2,550 pints of
blood. During the three weeks,
more than 30 drives were held
around campus.
LSA senior Kevin Weiss, the
Blood Battle's co-chair, said the
group placed a greater empha-
sis on recruitment this after last
year's loss to OSU.

played
like they had
nothing to
lose because
there wasn't
anything
else to lose.
This was EVERETT
already the COOK
worst sea-
son of Brady
Hoke's Michigan coaching
career. Athletic Director Dave

Brandon was forced to release a
statement emphasizing the job
safety of his head coach. Before
the game, the job of at least one
coordinator, offensive coordina-
tor Al Borges, was most likely in
jeopardy.
Ohio State was a 14-point
favorite. People were expecting
a blowout. At a tailgate before
the game, Michigan fans were
more concerned with Ohio State
coach Urban Meyer potentially
running up the score than they

were about actually winning the
game.
So on a Saturday with nothing
to lose, the Wolverines played
the way they shou yhave all
along. Instead of mindlessly
handing the ball off-tackle for
a one-yard loss, Michigan had
reverses to tight ends and a dou-
ble pass from a wide receiver to
a wide receiver-turned-quarter-
back.
Michigan's running backs
carried the ball just 24 time ,

and you could count the num-
ber of off-tackle runs on one
hand. There was no forcing
the ball into the middle of the
defense behind a raw offensive
line, because the Wolverines
employed end-arounds and
reverses toward the sidelines to
spread the field.
And most importantly,
instead of taking sacks left and
right, Gardner took advantage of
receiversarunningshorter routes.

CAMPUS EVENT
AIDS week to
raise awareness
across campus

BSU and other
student groups to
host daily events
By EMILIE PLESSET
Daily StaffReporter
In observance of World AIDS
Day on Dec. 1, the University's
Black Student Union will host its
yearly AIDS in Black and Brown
Week this week. There will be
interactive events throughout
the week to spread HIV/AIDS
awareness and education on
campus.
Although BSU organizes the
week, events are run by a variety
of University-affiliated organi-
zations, including the National
Council of Negro Women, the
Women of Color Collective and
the Egyptian Students Associa-
tion.
LSA senior Tyrell Collier,
BSU's president, said the goal of
the week is to raise awareness
about the HIV/AIDS epidem-
ics' impacts on the Black and
Latino/a community.
LSA senior Ozi Uduma, BSU's
Seba - whose task it is to wel-
come, both physically and spiri-
tually, those present at the mass

meetings - and co-coordinator
of the week, said the events pro-
vide a domestic focus on the
HIV/AIDS epidemic in these
communities.
"Just because the U.S. as a
whole isn't talking about HIV/
AIDS or putting it on the fore-
front as they did in the 80s and
90s doesn't mean that it's still not
prevalent, especially for those
who grew up in the Detroit area,"
Uduma said.
The National Council of Negro
Women and Images will host the
first event of the week Monday
in North Quad at 7:00 p.m. Dur-
ing the event, participants will
play "Sex Games," a game-show
contest similar to Family Feud,
but the questions pertain to HIV/
AIDS and same-sex practices..
The same day, the Phi Beta
Sigma National Pan-Hellenic fra-
ternity will host the week's sec-
ond event in Palmer Commons
where participants will play
"Sexas Hold 'Em," - in the place
of poker chips, participants will
use condoms.
On Dec. 4 the Michigan
Women of Color Collective and
the Egyptian Students Associa-
tion are holding a screening of
the 2011 film "Asmaa" in North

On a desolate, rocky
mountaintop in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean, one of
the world's most advanced

ground-based telescopes and a
team of University researchers
seek to shed light on some of
the universe's greatest astro-

A study expected to be pub-

Nature will challenge the cur-

emissions from black holes,
based on the observations of
a collaborative global team

Observatory in Hawaii.
It was previously believed
that light emission, or lumi-
nosity, from black holes
reaches a threshold called
the Eddington limit, at which
no more light can be emitted
due to the physics of the black

"The bottom line - Health-
Care.gov on December 1st is night
and day from where it was on
October 1st," chief White House
troubleshooter Jeff Zients told
reporters.
Amid all the problems with
HealthCare.gov, President Barack
Obama set a deadline for Saturday
for several significant problems
to be resolved. The administra-
tion organized a conference call
with reporters Sunday morning
to give a status report.
"There is more work to be
done to continue to improve and
enhance the website and con-
tinue to improve the consumer
experience in the weeks and
months ahead," the Department
of Health and Human Services
wrote in a memo to reporters.
The White House is hoping for
a fresh start. A wave of bad pub-
licity over the site's early failures
cast a shadow overthe president's
chief domestic achievement.
Even with the repairs in place,
the site still won't be able to
do everything the administra-
tion wants, and companion sites
for small businesses and Span-
ish speakers have been delayed.
Questions remain about the sta-
bility of the site and the quality of
the data it delivers to insurers.
Obama promised a few weeks
ago that HealthCare.gov "will
work much better on Nov. 30, Dec.
1, than it worked certainly on Oct.
L" But, in trying to lower expecta-
tions, he said he could not guaran-
tee that "100 percentof the people
100 percent of the time going on
this website will have a perfectly
seamless, smooth experience."
Obama rightly predicted errors
would remain. The department
reported the website is up and
running 95 percent of the time
- meaning a 1-in-20 chance of
finding a broken website remains.
The government also estimated
that pages crashed a rate less
than once every 100 clicks.

Police remove
Morsi supporters
from Tahrir Square
CAIRO (AP) - Police fired
tear gas to drive hundreds of
supporters of Egypt's ousted
Islamist president from Cairo's
famed Tahrir Square on Sunday,
as a panel tasked with amending
the constitution adopted dur-
ing his time in office agreed on
changes to the text.
The 50-member panel revis-
ing the Islamist-tilted charter
adopted under former President
Mohammed Morsi managed to
resolve its differences after two
days of clause-by-clause voting
on the final draft.
The text gives women and
Christians "suitable representa-
tion" but says a future law must
decide the details. It also calls
for elections, either parliamen-
tary or presidential, within 90
days after the draft constitution
is adopted. The other election
should be held up to six months
later.
The new charter would
require future presidents to
declare their financial assets
annually, and allows lawmakers
to vote out an elected president
and call for early elections if they
have a two-thirds majority.
Members agreed that a
contentious proposed article
allowing military tribunals for
civilians would be scaled back,
allowing them only in case of
direct attack on military person-
nel or assets.
Rights activists had previous-
ly objected to the military's trial
of some 10,000 civilians when
it ran the country during the 17
months after Egypt's 2011 revolt
that ousted longtime autocrat
Hosni Mubarak.
The document is now to be
handed over to interim President
Adly Mansour, who has a month
to call for a nationwide referen-
dum on it.
If adopted by the public,

a giant step in the roadmap
announced by the military when
it removed Morsi last summer
will have been completed.
Morsi supporters have been
staging near daily protests to
demand his reinstatement, in
Cairo and across much of the
country. But for hundreds of
them to enter and take over Tah-
rir, even briefly as they did Sun-
day, constituted a major, albeit
symbolic, propaganda coup for
them. They would have attracted
many more like-minded protest-
ers had they been able to gain a
solid foothold in the square.
It was the first time in more
than a yearthat Islamists entered
the central square in significant
numbers. The location has been
the near exclusive domain of lib-
eral and secular protesters since
shortly after Morsi took office in
June 2012 as Egypt's first freely
elected president.
Also in the background to
Sunday's events was scathing
criticism of the military-backed
government by a top rights group
that called on authorities to
immediately release five Morsi
aides who have been kept at an
undisclosed destination since
their arrest on July 3, the day
Morsi was ousted.
Police in Tahrir acted quickly
and appeared to surprise pro-
testers, firing heavy tear gas
to clear them from the central
plaza barely minutes after they
took it over and sending them
to take refuge in side streets.
After an initial salvo of some two
dozen canisters, armored police
vans rushed to the square with
sirens wailing.
Later, six army armored per-
sonnel carriers arrived. After
nightfall, the protesters and
police fought pitched battles on
side streets off Tahrir and in the
downtown area, with police fir-
ing tear gas and the protesters
pelting them with rocks.
The square was the birth-
place of the revolt that toppled
Mubarak almost three years ago.
That uprising was led by liberal

and secular youth groups, whose
differences with the Islamists
began to surface later in 2011
over claims that Morsi's Broth-
erhood and its allies were more
interested in promoting their
own political interests than pur-
suing the uprising's goals.
Sunday's Islamist protest-
ers came from Cairo University,
where they have been protest-
ing the death on Thursday of an
engineering student at the hands
of police. Non-Islamist students
were also protesting the death of
the student on Sunday, but they
restricted their demonstration to
the areaoutside the Cairo Univer-
sity campus in the Giza district.
It was not immediately clear
why police did not stop the pro-
testers from reaching Tahrir,
a 30-minute journey on foot
from the university campus on
the west bank of the River Nile.
There was no police presence
outside the campus either.
Jubilant Islamist students
knelt down and offered a prayer
of thanks as their march drew
closer to Tahrir. Once there, they
chanted slogans againstthe mili-
tary and police and flashed the
four-finger sign that commemo-
rates the death of hundreds of
Morsi supporters by security
forces since a military coup oust-
ed the Islamist president on July
3.
Morsi's supporters immedi-
ately relayed the news on social
networks, calling on others to
join them quickly and suggesting
that camping out indefinitely in
the iconic square would eventu-
ally topple the military-backed
government.
Also on Sunday, Egyptian
authorities ordered the release
from police custody of promi-
nent activist Ahmed Maher,
founder of the revolution-
ary April 6 Movement, a main
player in the 2011 revolt against
Mubarak. Prosecutors, however,
extended by 15 days the deten-
tion of another iconic figure
from the 2011 uprising - Alaa
Abdel-Fattah.

Record crowds

Did retailers shoot themselves
in the foot?
U.S. retailers offered holiday
discounts in early November
and opened stores on Thanks-

crowds, but they didn't motivate
Americans to spend.
A record 248 million people
are expected to shop in stores
and online over the four-day
Thanksgiving weekend that ends
Sunday, up from last year's 247
million, according to the Nation-
al Retail Federation.
But total spending is expected
to fall for the first time ever since
the retail group started track-

weekend, spending is estimated
to reach $57.4 billion, down 2.9
percent from last year.

Rights and Akram al-Halabi, a
rebel spokesman based in nearby
in Aleppo.
The Observatory obtains its
information from a network of
activists on the ground. Syr-
* ian state media said government
forces killed "terrorists," which
is how they describe armed rebels
fighting against President Bashar
Assad's rule.

BLOOD
From Page 1A
"There was a real improve-
ment this year," Weiss said. "We
procured incentives that ben-
efited the blood drive like prom-
ising (donors) Chipotle. We also
had the added benefit of know-
ing that we lost last year, so that
was used to recruit as well."
According to the Univer-
sity Health Service, more
than 38,000 blood donations
are needed every day to meet
national demand, and someone
needs blood every two seconds.
Volunteer blood donations are
the only way hospitals can
acquire blood. One blood dona-
tion has the potential to save

three lives, according to the
American Red Cross.
"Utilizing the rivalry is a
way to recruit lifetime donors,"
Weiss said. "Blood does have a
shelf life. Donatingonce isgreat,
but every eight weeks you can
continue to donate blood. The
Blood Battle hopefully encour-
ages a mindset of giving."
While the competitionis over,
Blood Drives United and UHS
encourage anyone still inter-
ested in donating blood to visit
the Red Cross donation website.
UHS also encourages those who
are interested in becoming an
organ or bone marrow donor to
join the registries at Gift of Life
for organ donations and Be the
Match to be placed on the mar-
row registry.

"It is basically supposed to
bring awareness to artists who

other methods of dialogue to
talk about HIV/AIDS."

Witnesses report
train traveling at
high rate of speed
prior to accident
NEW YORK (AP) - A New
York City commuter train round-
ing a riverside curve derailed
Sunday, killing four people and
injuring more than 60 ina crash
that threw passengers from the
toppling cars and left a snaking
chain of twisted wreckage just
inches from the water.
Some of the roughly 150 pas-
sengers on the early morning
Metro-North train from Pough-
keepsie to Manhattan were jolt-
ed from sleep around 7:20 a.m. to
screams and the frighteningsen-
sation of their compartment roll-
ing over on a bend in the Bronx
where the Hudson and Harlem
rivers meet. When the motion
stopped, four or five of the seven
cars had lurched off the rails. It
was the latest accident in a trou-
bled year for the nation's sec-
ond-biggest commuter railroad,
which had never experienced a
passenger death in an accident
in its 31-year-history.

"Four people lost their lives
today in the holiday season,
right after Thanksgiving,"
Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a
news conference. Eleven of the
injured were believed to be criti-
cally injured and another six
seriously hurt, according to the
Fire Department.
The train operator was among
the injured, Cuomo said.
The governor said the track
did not appear to be faulty, leav-
ing speed as a possible culprit
for the crash. But he noted that
the National Transportation
Safety Board would determine
what happened. The Federal
Railroad Administration was
also sending 10 investigators to
the scene.
Metropolitan Transportation
Authority Chairman Thomas F.
Prendergast said investigators
would look at numerous factors,
including the train, the track
and signal system, the operators
and speed.
The speed limit on the curve is
30 mph, compared with 70 mph
in the area approaching it, MTA
spokeswoman Marjorie Anders
said. The train's data recorders
should be able to tell how fast it
was traveling, she said.

One passenger, Frank Tatulli,
told WABC-TV that the train
appeared to be going "a lot fast-
er" than usual as it approached
the sharp curve near the Spuy-
ten Duyvil station, which takes
its name from a Dutch word for
a local waterway, sometimes
translated as "Devil's whirl-
pool."
The train was about half full
at the time of the crash, rail offi-
cials said, with some passengers
likely heading to the city for hol-
iday shopping.
Joel Zaritsky was dozing as he
traveled to a dental convention.
"I woke up when the car
started rolling several times.
Then I saw the gravel coming at
me, and I heard people scream-
ing," he told The Associated
Press, holding his bloody right
hand. "There was smoke every-
where and debris. People were
thrown to the other side of the
train."
Nearby residents awoke to a
building-shaking boom. Angel
Gonzalez was in bed in his high-
rise apartment overlooking the
rail curve when he heard the
roar.
"I thought it was a plane that
crashed," he said.


EMISSION
From Page 1A
boringstars to suggest this limit
maybe exceeded in some cases.
"I think this is a first salvo
in this field," Bregman said. "It
shows that you can get the data
together to figure out the orbital
properties."
The findings at the Gemini
Observatory served as the final
step in a series of global stud-
ies conducted with the hope of
determining the mass of a single
black hole in the Pinwheel Gal-
axy, located approximately 21
million light-years from earth.
Once the mass was determined,
the scientists realized light
emissions from the region were
much higher than they should
appear under the Eddington
limit.
"This is a very tidy result
but it's not all-encompassing,"
Bregman said. "But maybe not
all ultra-luminous sources are
the same. What you want to do
now is do it for other systems."
Black holes are regions of
space so dense that even light
cannot escape the pull of their
gravity beyond a boundary
called the event horizon. When
they are observed from earth-
based telescopes, their center
appears black.
Contrary to their namesake,
black holes are actually some
of the brightest objects in the
universe. As matter is pulled
toward the event horizon, it
gains speed and collides with
other similar objects. This cre-
ates friction as objects closer to
the horizon move faster than
objects farther away.
"That friction gets turned
into heat which gets turned into
light, which is why black holes
are so bright," Bregman said.
Larger black holes, known as
intermediate or supermassive,
can range from a few hundred
to a billion times larger than the
sun. The black hole observed in

the study, designated as ULX-1,
is known as a stellar mass black
hole. Although it is much small-
er than other types, it is still
many times larger than the sun.
Given the emission level
from ULX-1, scientists knew it
was either a stellar mass black
hole emitting too much light
or an intermediate black hole
emitting a small portion of its
potential. Using the Gemini
telescope, the researchers were
able to determine the velocity,
period and mass of surrounding
stars, allowing them to calcu-
late the mass of the black hole.
"It's a crazy field in that
every time you get 10 pieces of
information, five say it's a stel-
lar mass black hole and five say
it's an intermediate black hole,"
Bregman said.
At such vast distances, the
researchers were observing pri-
marily x-ray light, which is not
visible to the naked eye. The
Gemini telescope, as well as sev-
eral others used on the project,
was equipped with instruments
capable of detecting the various
forms of light emitted from the
region.
"They're very faint, so it's
very hard to do," Bregman said.
"The techniques that you would
use in the Milky Way just don't
work."
Of all scientific phenomena,
Bregman said the people he
interacts with are intrinsically
and rightfully drawn to black
holes. The observatories used
in the study are not only major
research centers, but also tour-
ist attractions for individuals
wishing to explore the universe.
"They are the most exotic
objects in the universe," he
said. "They are a place where
the actual fabric of space-time
breaks down. You might care
about anything because either
it's going to make you a better
piece of toast in the morning
or it's just really interesting -
black holes are just really inter-
esting."

Accessible AP
Michigan needs to open college prepatory courses to diverse students
School districts across the nation have implemented initiatives to
expand Advanced Placement course offerings - high-level courses
that offer students the opportunity to earn college credit in high
school - to groups with limited access to academic resources, includ-
ing Black, Hispanic, low-income and aspiring first-generation college
students. In spring 2013, the state of Washington passed legislation that
encourages students who meet a state threshold on state standardized
exams or similar tests to enroll in Advanced Placement courses. Michi-
gan, on the other hand, isn't doing enough to encourage diverse and low-
income students to enroll in AP courses. At the district, state and federal
levels, more action needs to be taken to encourage a diverse group of stu-
dents to enroll in these classes as well as make it more economically fea-
sible for them to take AP exams in preparation.

Growing up in a town of
fewer than 4,000 resi-
dents, it became very clear
to me after step-
ping foot on this
campus that I
wasn't exposed
to some of the
same opportuni-
ties growing upi
as my peers.
It seemed ini-
tially that every- SARA
one around me MOROSI
was from a big
city - some-
where rich in culture and diversity.
I began to feel as if I were in an
arms race with my peers, not know-
ing how to reach the finish, and def-
initely not knowing how to come
close to winning. It was intimidat-
ing, and there were times in the
first few months that I wanted to go
back home. Lookingback, Isee how
foolish I was being.
As I continued to get to know
other freshmen, my insecurities
began to fade. I met people who
shared a similar background with
me, along with the many who did
not. According to the University's
Office of Registrar, 30 percent of
students are out-of-state, with rep-
resentation from all 50 states. Six
percent are international, with stu-
dents hailing from 150 countries.
I stopped looking at the geo-
graphical diversity at this Universi-
ty as a cause of personal diffidence,
and instead began to appreciate how
many people I had to learn from. As
cliche as it may sound, some of the
most valuable lessons I'll take from
this place were taught by my peers
outside of the classroom.
I began to recognize that no one
background is "better" than the
next, and because of that, I had

a renewed sense of appreciation
for my small-town upbringing: for
what it gave me, and for what it
allowed me to share with the peo-
ple around me.
I recently started following Huff-
ington Post's Love Letters project
- a series of letters written by those
who have something to say about
the place that means the most to
them. For many, it's the place they
call "home." You can find love let-
ters written to some of the world's
most beautiful and desired destina-
tions - London, Paris, New York
City, New Orleans and-Hong Kong,
for instance.
But where's the love for the
small towns? Cities with popula-
tions in the thousands, even hun-
dreds, seemed to be barely a blip on
the project's map. Thus, my ode to
small towns everywhere:
Dear Small Town,'
I'm sorry for having left you. It
wasn't you; it was me. I'll forever be
grateful for the
years we spent
together, but Realizin
our time had
run its course. backgroun
Even so, my
gratitude is still than anot
very much alive mena r
for you, small ap
town. I hope home
you understand.
I came to
know you well,
small town - so well that I could
navigate your contours with my
eyes closed. I appreciated that
familiarity. You were predictable,
but I was OK with that. In fact, it's
one of the qualities I still love most
about you.
I loved our traditions, my favor-
ite being Fridays in autumn. I
remember the excitement that

would hit me as soon as I woke up.
Once 7 p.m. rolled around, it was
the same excitement that made its
way to the football field that was
home to most for a few hours on
those Friday nights. Those memo-
ries are some of my most cherished.
I could tell you, small town, that
running errands in my new place is
a lot quicker now. When I was with
you, grocery shopping took so long.
With you, I had to stop and have a
conversation with everyone I knew,
which was essentially everyone I
saw. I could also tell you that I miss
that.
I remember saying goodbye to you
on that August night, sitting in the
top row of the stands. There were
no players on the field that time, and
the rows below me were empty. I was
scared. I didn't think I wanted to
leave you, small town. You were safe.
Some might think you held my hand
too much, but I don't agree. You gave
me support and comfort. You gave
me the friends
I'll always come
lg n0 one back to, and the
families that
d is better became my sec-
ond.You gave me
her made a solid founda-
-Ciate X tion to build on.
i Y Since leaving
town. you,I've learned
that "home" is
a word that's
interchangeable.
They say home is where the heart is,
and that's why you'll always have a
piece of mine, small town. But I hope
you can understand that pieces of
my heart will be left elsewhere, too.
Starting here in Ann Arbor, my sec-
ond place to call home.

There are a number of barriers that may dis-
courage students from taking AP classes. Many
districts mandate AP enrollment require-
ments, such as teacher recommendations and
extremely high test scores, which can discour-
age the academically underserved. According
to a report from The Education Trust, only 6
percent of Black students are enrolled in the AP
program, which is is almost half of the 11.7-per-
cent national average of AP participants. Low-
income students make up just 5.5 perfect of the
participants, and they are are three times less
likely to enroll in an AP course than those from
higher-income families.
The barriers to entry for AP classes should
be lowered. Opponents argue that content
may have to be "watered down" because for
the benefit of unprepared students. While this
sentiment may be true in some cases, research
conducted by the College Board challenges
this assumption. When analyzing data from
690,000 high-school graduates in 2012, the
College Board found that 75 percent of Ameri-
can Indian students,f66percent of Hispanic stu-
dents and 72 percent of Black students whose
PSAT scores showed that they had the potential
to be successful in an AP math course weren't
enrolled. Other studies show that both diverse
low-income students and students of color who
enroll in AP classes perform well, even when
the requirements to take these classes are sig-
nificantly lowered.
There are benefits to having a more diverse
group of students in classroom settings. A
University study conducted from 1990 to 1994
states that students who interact with a diverse

group of peers in both informal and classroom
settings show the greatest "engagement in
active thinking, growth in intellectual engage-
ment, and growth in intellectual and academic
skills."
In 2013, Michigan's AP program partici-
pation was lower than the national average.
Furthermore, Michigan should look into pass-
ing legislation similar to that of washington's,
lowering the threshold on standardized tests.
As of April 2013, educational representatives
of Washington have been in favor of the leg-
islation because it has engendered "incred-
ible benefits," such as an increase in AP exam
enrollment for students.
Efforts to make AP tests more affordable for
low-income students are lacking. For example,
the Michigan Department of Education has for-
tunately received a federal AP Test Fee Reduc-
tion Grant for the past 11 years, butnthis year the
grant has been held up by the federal govern-
ment - Michigan may not end up acquiring the
grant at all. This grant is very important for all
students to get credit for college courses and
save money, and for those who hadn't consid-
ered it, to make higher educationa more realis-
tic prospect. Congress needs to make this issue
a priority.
With a combined effort from districts
around the University as well as the state and
federal government, acceptance into AP classes
for a wider range of students of diverse back-
grounds can become a reality, and AP exams
will become more economically feasible for
students. By doing so, students - as well as the
classes themselves - will greatly benefit.

Over the next couple of holiday-filled
months, students will travel more than they do
all year. For many, this involves flying and the
hassles that come with it in the name of nation-
al security. Though some are clearly necessary
to keep passengers safe, others, such as the
Travel Security Agency's Screening of Passen-
gers by Observation Technique program, have
come under intense scrutiny for being ineffec-
tive, racist and expensive - and rightfully so.
According to a report from the U.S. Gov-
ernment Accountability Office, the program
- which has cost nearly $1 billion since its
inception - trains and deploys more than
3,000 behavior detection officers to the nation's
busiest airports. There, they go undercover and
attempt to identify suspicious-looking individ-
uals who may pose a security threat. The TSA
calls this a "common sense" approach to com-
bating terrorism. But this model assumes that
terrorists all look and behave in the same ways.
The GAO found that these officers are only able
to identify threats at a rate that is the "same as
or slightly better than chance" - essentially
calling the method's usefulness into question.
Moreover, the report raises doubts about
whether these superficial means can decide
who looks questionable in art objective way.
Largely perpetrated by the media, wide-
spread bias about what terrorists look like
means these so-called "objective" methods
can lead to racial profiling. Because these offi-
cers are often undercover, there's no way for
victims of potential racial profiling to know
for sure whether or not they have been tar-
geted. So, while the TSA maintains that race
and religion are never factors, we can't be
sure the agency's behavior detection officers
don't put a greater burden on certain races or
groups. In any case, the TSA's willingness to
tolerate possible racial profiling is unaccept-
able - even more so in the face of a program
with a dubious success record.
Furthermore, some of the behaviors that tip
off officers to possible terrorists include seem-
ing stressed, rushed, nervous, or expressing an
opinion of security processes. But the process
itself tends to provoke these reactions. Under
these rules, it doesn't take more than a fear of

flying, anxiety about missing a flight or dissat-
isfaction with the system to display so-called
terrorist behavior.
Lastspring, I was selected for further inspec-
tion at Detroit Metro Airport after making
negative remarks about the x-ray scanners and
having to take my shoes off. But this targeting
doesn't just target the outspoken. SPOT's sole
purpose is to systematically target individuals
that stand out for a variety of reasons. Maybe
they're sweating too much. Maybe they're too
loud. Maybe they look tired. Regardless of their
so-called physical symptoms of being a ter-
rorist, singling out individuals who are most
distressed by an inherently nerve-wracking
security process is wrong and unhelpful.
While some of these officers are stationed
at security checkpoints where travelers know
they are beingwatched, many are not. Require-
ments for TSA officer identification are not
uniform and vary across the country. Several
airports do not require that these officers be
stationed at security stations, or even be in
a TSA uniform. In April, LAX removed the
requirement to keep officers at security check-
points at all times, so as to reduce the pre-
dictability of security measures. Instead, the
officers are sentinside the airport, where trav-
elers have no idea that they are being watched,
or that the guy who randomly started talking
to the them was an undercover agent. Domes-
tic spying is illegal for other agencies such as
the CIA, so why the TSA would be allowed to
do it on a regular basis makes little sense.
SPOT is currently being reviewed by the
House Committee of Homeland Security's
Subcommittee on Transportation Security,
after behavior detection officers failed to
spot a gunman who killed a TSA officer and
wounded three others at LAX on Nov. 1, and
after the GAO and Department of Homeland
Security both publicly criticized the pro-
gram. Both Democratic and Republican rep-
resentatives have called for SPOT's funding
to be stripped. For the many travelers that
have been putting up with BDO's antics since
the program began in 2007, it's about time.

Then, Christiane Gruber, asso-
ciate professor of Islamic art,
who recently organized a sympo-
sium onthe art of the Arab Spring
* uprisings, will be curating a more
in-depth exhibition of Islamic art
next fall. As part of her exhibi-
tion, Professor Gruber will show-
case pieces that cannot be shown

From now on? It's December.
There's one game - a mediocre,
bowl-everyone-forgets-in-five-years
type ofgame -leftintheseason.
It was initially encouraging
to see this Michigan team. Hav-s
ing the ball with a chance to win
the game with less than a minute
left is more than mostanyone was
expecting.
But where has this sense of
urgency been for the last two
months? This offense combined
for 501 total yards in three losses
to Michigan State, Nebraska and
Iowa. On Saturday, the Wolver-
ines had 603.
"We got ready to play," Hoke
said after the game. "Had a good
plan. We executed better, we
blocked better. There's a lot of
things we did better."
A reporter followed up and
askedifitwasreallyjustthatsim-
ple. Hoke said, "At the end of the
day, yeah," which is just not true.
He knowsit, I knowitandso does
anyone who has watched a Mich-
igan football game this season.
This wasn't the same offense.
It wasn't like the players execut-
ed the same game plan they've
been struggling with since being
demolished in East Lansing.
They executed better, yes, but

they executed a better offense,
one that had wrinkles that
weren't entirely predictable and
plays that Michigan hasn't run at
all this season. Borges called for a
throwback screen to a freshman
tight end, Jake Butt. We didn't
see anything remotely like that
before Ohio State.
That doesn't make any sense.
There's no point of saving your
best for the last game of the sea-
son when every foreseeable goal
is out of reach. There was no
more Big Ten to win, nor a10-win
plateau to reach. Whynotgo balls
to the wall and take some risks
before this game?
That'swhyit's hardto feelgood
aboutagame like Saturday, to pull
out some sliver of redemption on
this lost season, when so many
what-ifs come of it. That's why
Borges's job shouldn'tbe saved -
it should be more in question.,
What if Michigan had this
playbook forthe lasttwo months?
What if this offense pulls off
some close wins instead of los-
inginthe last minute to Nebraska
and Penn State?
What if this was the team
Michigan could have been all
along, but we didn't see it until
the last game of the year?

the light levels are too high,"
Johnson said. "So we could only
show things that are metal, are
glass, are ceramics."
But with the only constraint
being a material one, Johnson
had a wide variety of pieces to
pick from while curating the
exhibit. She followed the inter-
ests of the family who originally
brought the pieces to the Univer-
sity. According to Johnson, much
of the collection was collected
by former University president
Alexander Grant Ruthven and
the Ruthven family. Ruthven
focused on the aesthetic - the
big, beautiful objects that had
very ornate details.
"That's kind of how we chose
some of our pieces, for their aes-
thetic quality, the beauty of the
objects even though they were
used for everyday use," Johnson
said.
The title of the exhibit -
"Fragments of the Past" - is
appropriate as many of the pieces
are literally fragments of larger
objects worn from use.
"There are a number of glass
shards that have very intricate
detail on them, but they still give
clues to the cultural background
of the pieces, the influence of cul-
ture," Johnson said.
It isn't that surprising that

somethinglike aglassbowlmight
beveryintricate and detailed. But
even objects used for more rigor-
ous tasks were endowed with
beautybytheir creators.
"There are these beautiful
ceramic filters, and there's very
ornate detail on them, but they
were used to filter the Nile,"
Johnson said. "The Nile is, and
always has been, very dirty, so
it's a very functional piece, but
you also see that the artisan gave
amazing attention to that."
The artisans of the Islamic
world endowed the mundane
objects of their daily lives with
beauty. Now, "Fragments of the
Past," will take these objects
and appreciate them for the art
that they are and always have
been.
At the very least, this exhibi-
tion will allow viewers to appre-
ciate Islamic art as it exists
beyond the mosques and mosaics.
But after appreciating the beauty
of a humble water filter, perhaps
viewers will appreciate the beau-
ty of the mundane objects of the
present.
"It's kind of this dialogue
that's happening from the past
to the present in response, and
I thinks that's something that's
really important at the Univer-
sity," Johnson said.

Police disperse
crowds with tear
gas and flash
grenades
KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A
protest by about 300,000
Ukrainians angered by their
government's decision to
freeze integration with the
West turned violent Sunday,
when a group of demonstra-
tors besieged the presi-
dent's office and police
drove them back with trun-
cheons, tear gas and flash
grenades. Dozens of people
were injured.
The mass rally in central
Kiev defied a government ban
on protests on Independence
Square, in the biggest show
of anger over President Vik-
tor Yanukovych's refusal to
sign a political and economic
agreement with the European
Union.
The protesters also were
infuriated by the violent dis-
persal of a small, opposition
rally two nights before.
While opposition leaders
called for a nationwide strike
and prolonged peaceful street
protests to demand that the
government resign, several
thousand people broke away
and marched to Yanukovych's
nearby office.
A few hundred of them,
wearing masks, threw rocks
and other objects at police and
attempted to break through the
police lines with a front loader.
After several hours of clashes,
riot police used force to push
them back.
Dozens of people with what
appeared to be head injuries
were taken awayby ambulance.
Several journalists, including
some beaten by police, were
iijured in the clashes.
"Opposition leaders
denounced the clashes as a
provocation aimed at discredit-
ing the peaceful demonstration
and charged that the people
who incited the storming of the
presidential office were gov-
ernment-hired thugs.
Several opposition lead-
ers, including world boxing
champion Vitali Klitschko,
walked over to Yanukovych's
office to urge protesters
to return to Independence
Square. Order appeared to
have been restored by Sunday
night, with rows of riot police
standing guard behind metal
fences.
Some protesters then headed
to Yanukovych's residence out-
side Kiev, but their cars were
stopped by police.
Speaking before the vast

crowds on Independence
Square from the roof of a bus,
the opposition leaders demand-
ed that Yanukovych and his
government resign.
"Our plan is clear: It's not a
demonstration, it's not a reac-
tion. It's a revolution," said
Yuriy Lutsenko, a former inte-
rior minister who is now an
opposition leader.
Chants of "revolution"
resounded across a sea of yel-
low and blue Ukrainian and
EU flags on the square, where
the government had prohibited
rallies starting Sunday. Thou-
sands of protesters remained
late into the evening and some
were preparing to spend the
night on the square.
The demonstration was by
far the largest since the pro-
tests began more than a week
ago and it carried echoes of
the 2004 Orange Revolution,
when tens of thousands came
to the square nightly for weeks
and set up a tent camp along
the main street leading to the
square.
The opposition leaders urged
Ukrainians from all over the
country to join the protests in
the capital.
"Our future is being decid-
ed here in Kiev," Klitschko
said.
Ukrainian lawmakers meet
Monday for consultations and
planned to hold a parliament
session Tuesday. The opposi-
tion is hoping to muster enough
votes to oust Prime Minister
Mykola Azarov's Cabinet after
several lawmakers quit Yanu-
kovych's Party of Regions in
protest.
The U.S. Embassy issued a
joint statement from U.S. and
EU ambassadors encouraging
Ukrainians to resolve their
differences peacefully and
urging "all stakeholders in the
political process to establish
immediate dialogue to facili-
tate a mutually acceptable
resolution to the current dis-
cord."
Protests have been held
daily in Kiev since Yanu-
kovych backed away from an
agreement that would have
established free trade and
deepened political coopera-
tion between Ukraine and
the EU. He justified the deci-
sion by saying that Ukraine
couldn't afford to break trade
ties with Russia.
The EU agreement was to
have been signed Friday and
since then the protests have
gained strength.
"We are furious," said
62-year-old retired business-
man Mykola Sapronov, who
was among the protesters Sun-
day. "The leaders must resign.
We want Europe and freedom."

As the demonstrators
approached Independence
Square and swept away
metal barriers from around
a large Christmas tree set
up in the center, all police
left the square. About a
dozen people then climbed
the tree to hang EU and
Ukrainian flags from its
branches.
Several hundred demon-
strators never made it to the
square. Along the way they
burst into the Kiev city admin-
istration building and occu-
pied it, in defiance of police,
who tried unsuccessfully to
drive them away by using tear
gas.
The EU agreement had been
eagerly anticipated by Ukraini-
ans who want their country of
45 million people to break out
of Moscow's orbit. Opinion sur-
veys in recent months showed
about 45 percent of Ukrainians
supporting closer integration
with the EU and a third or less
favoring closer ties with Rus-
sia.
Moscow tried to block the
deal with the EU by banning
some Ukrainian imports and
threatening more trade sanc-
tions. A 2009 dispute between
Kiev and Moscow on gas prices
resulted in a three-week cutoff
of gas to Ukraine.
Yanukovych was traveling
to China for a state visit this
week. Afterward, the president
planned to visit Russia and
reach agreement on normaliz-
ing trade relations, Azarov said
Sunday.
For Yanukovych, memories
of the Orange Revolution are
still raw.
Those protests forced the
annulment of a fraud-tainted
presidential election in which
he was shown to have won the
most votes. A rerun of the elec-
tion was ordered, and he lost
to Western-leaning reformist
Viktor Yushchenko.
Yanukovych was elected
president five years later, nar-
rowly defeating then-Prime
Minister Yulia Tymoshen-
ko, the leading figure of the
Orange Revolution.
Tymoshenko was sentenced
to seven years imprisonment
in 2011 for abuse of office, a
case that the West has widely
criticized as political revenge.
The EU had set Tymoshenko's
release, or at least her free-
dom to go to Germany for
treatment of a severe back
problem, as a key criterion for
signing the association pact
with Ukraine.
The prospect of freeing his
archenemy was deeply unat-
tractive to Yanukovych, who
comes up for re-election in
early 2015.

DeWoif killed during
robbery, suspects say

Detroit Free Press
obtains statements
of arrested S.C. men
ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -
Two suspects in the fatal shoot-
ing of a University of Michigan
medical student say they sneaked
into Paul DeWolf's basement
bedroom at his medical frater-
nity during a burglary attempt
and that his shooting was unin-
tended, according to police state-
ments.
The Detroit Free Press report-
ed Sunday that it obtained police
statements from two men jailed
on murder and home invasion
charges in the death of Paul
DeWolf, a 25-year-old prospec-
tive surgeon whose body was
found July 24.
According to the statements,
the suspects and a third man
not yet charged in the case broke
into Phi Rho Sigma medical fra-
ternity and entered DeWolf's
basement bedroom, startling
him.
DeWolf went to get some-
thing from his dresser and one

of the suspects tried to strike
him with the gun, but it fired
instead, according to the state-
ments. Ann Arbor police Detec-
tive Katie Nucci recounted the
statements at a Nov. 22 warrant
hearing for Joei Jordan, 20, and
Shaquille Jones, 21, the newspa-
per said.
Using data about astolen com-
puter, investigators tracked Jor-
dan to Sumter County, S.C., and
Jones to North Charleston, S.C.
A third suspect accused of fir-
ing the gun is jailed in Michigan
on a bond violation in another
case but hasn't been charged in
DeWolf's killing.
DeWolf was a native of School-
craft in southwestern Michigan
and a graduate of Grand Valley
State University. He was attend-
ing medical school on an Air
Force scholarship and held the
rank of second lieutenant.
In her testimony, Nucci said
Jordan entered through an
open rear window as Jones and
the third man remained out-
side. Jordan emerged a short
time later with a PlayStation
3, taken from a basement rec-
reation room in the house and
hidden in his backpack, the

detective said.
Jordan climbed back through
the window and let the other
two in through a rear door,
Jones told detectives. Eventu-
ally, they ended up in the base-
ment, where they hid ina utility
closet when they heard two stu-
dents coming down a hallway,
Nucci testified.
The three of them then made
their way to the room where
DeWolf lived and entered.
Jones said DeWolf got out of
bed "and was asking what was
going on," the detective testified.
She said Jones told investigators
that the third suspect "pulled out
a handgun and pointed it" at the
medical student and "ordered
DeWolf not to move."
"At some point DeWolf
grabbed something off of his
desk and/or drawer" and started
to move toward the third sus-
pect, at which time the man
"raised the gun and attempted to
strike DeWolf with the gun, and
the gun at that time fired."
DeWolf screamed, and the
suspects ran off, Nucci testified.
The next court dates are
Thursday for Jones and Dec. 12
for Jordan.

Commercializing
the fine arts

Is Hollywood
ruining theater
with adaptations?
By REBECCA GODWIN
Daily Arts Writer
Recently, the world of fine arts
has grown increasingly present in
mainstream media. Hollywood
producers are making musical
after musical into mildly success-
ful movies. Multiple media outlets
have covered street artist Banksy.
TV shows like "Glee" and "Smash"
made it cool to be a part of glee
clubs, acappella groups and other
singing organizations. Fine arts
has become increasingly commer-
cialized, and while that has helped
expose new people to the arts, is it
worth risking the integrity of the
art?
When I first stumbled my way
into fine arts, I was a sophomore
in high school. "Glee" had just
started, and its quirkiness and
mix of modern and classic songs
attracted me and most of the kids
in my school. So, when the annual
musical was announced, dozens of
us decided to audition. The final
cast, which included myself, was
huge, but the appeal of performing
quickly faded when many in the
ensemble realized that hard work
was required to put on a number
similar to Rachel Berry's.
By the next year, "Glee," while
still popular, no longer held the
interest of many of my classmates.
Movies like "Mamma Mia!" were
popular enough, but the students
around me had learned that big
song-and-dance numbers weren't
as easy to put together as Hol-
lywood made it seem. But I was
hooked - I performed in the

school musicals again my junior
and senior year, and soon I was
devouring everything that had
anything to do with Broadway.
But in recent years, fine arts
has become increasingly popular,
and I've begun to miss the times
when no one knew any Broadway
show besides "Wicked." It's not
that I'm upset that more people are
beginning to enjoy fine arts; I'm
just afraid that, in order to appeal
to a wider audience, executives
will begin to take the fine arts and
commercialize them.
Hollywood has already claimed
its first victim with "Glee." When
the show first started, I loved it. It
was a poignant look at high school,
and it gave the best representation
I'd ever seen of what it felt like to
be a part of a theater group. But as
the popularity increased, the show
began to change. Soon episodes
were dedicated to plot lines revolv-
ing around Britney Spears and
Lady Gaga, and the quirkiness was
replaced with the mainstream.
The next to fall to commer-
cialism was the movie musical.
Over the past several years, the
movie musical has gone through
a rebirth. Well known musicals
like "Chicago" and "Hairspray"
were all brought to the big screen
in fairly accurate adaptations
thanks to casts of genuinely tal-
ented performers. Then came
"Sweeney Todd," "Rock of Ages"
and "Mamma Mia!," and while the
stories were decent, the perform-
ers were slowly being replaced
with better known actors, who,
while quite famous, didn't pos-
sess the vocal capabilities the roles
required.
Finally, Cameron Mackintosh
decidedtobringthe powerful "Les
Miserables" to the bigscreen and I
couldn't have been angrier. I love

"Les Mis;" the music is breathtak-
ing, the story is heartbreaking and
when the show is performed with
the right cast, the show can be
awe-inspiring. But I knew Mack-
intosh wasn't going to cast the
right people. I knew that actual
talent would be sacrificed for big
names, so I dreaded the release. I
watched in anger as people around
me, people who had never once
shown any interest for the arts,
gushed about the upcoming movie
because Wolverine, the Gladiator
and Mia Thermopolis were going
to be in it.
When I did finally see it, every-
thing I had predicted had come
true. Hollywood destroyed the
masterpiece that is "Les Mis."
They were more concerned with
Oscar nominations and box office
numbers than preserving the
integrity of the piece. They moved
scenes, added songs, removed
musical numbers, cut out pieces
of the story altogether and then
claimed it was a cinematic tri-
umph.
But the masses ate the film up.
Many of them had never seen the
stage production, let alone read the
book, so they had very little idea of
the extent to which they were
robbed. Now Hollywood is at
it again, with filming already
underway for "Into the Woods"
and "Annie." Again, the movies
are full of big names, but I don't
see any evidence that these peo-
ple know how to carry a tune.
Maybe I'm just bitter. Maybe
I should accept the growing
popularity. But as a person who
loves the fine arts, I would rath-
er these works go unnoticed by
the majority and stay untainted
by greed than be butchered and
commercialized so some execu-
tives can make a profit.

other moments helped develop
the characters by moving them
from their initial stereotypes.
For example, it showed Kate
not being the pretty trophy wife
and doing work to take care of
her kids.
ABC's other family comedy,
"The Goldbergs," only produced
a mediocre pilot. The show
focuses on the Goldberg family,
a group of people who love to
shout at each other. In the pilot,
the volume for every single line
was turned up to 11, and it was
headache-inducing to watch. S
'Trophy Wife'
and 'Goldbergs'
continue to *
improve.
The show's cast is talented,
but they have been given one
direction from the writers and
directors of the show: shout.
They do this very well, but it's
still grating after watching
it for 22 minutes. Jeff Garlin
("Curb Your Enthusiasm") is
the only one who can make this
type of dialogue work as Murray,
the father in the family. He plays
angry and loud very well and is
able to lessen the obnoxiousness
of some of the moments.
What works on "Goldbergs" is
the true sense of sentimentality
that is prevalent in each episode.
Each ends with a moment of
warmth and family togetherness.
This show, forcthe most part, nails
these moments because it lets
them come from real character
realizations, rather than forcing
them to occur. The Thanksgiv-
ing episode, for instance, ended
with the two sons, Adam (new-
comer Sean Giambrone) and
Barry (Troy Gentile, "Entou-
rage"), stopping their fighting
to acknowledge that they are
family, and they love each other.
After an episode with them doing
nothing but fighting, this was a
welcome change.
The glimmer of hope for
"Goldbergs" comes from the fact
that it's based on the creator's real
life. Adam F. Goldberg ("Break-
ing In") based this sitcom on his
childhood, complete with keep-
ing the names of the members of

"The Goldbergs" and "Trophy

Comedies in their first season
need time to grow and develop
their sense of humor and their
ensemble. So far, both of these
family comedies have earned
that time.

tle planning seems to have gone
into how the clips play off of one
another. A lot of potential lies in
using the juxtaposition of sketch-
es to contextualize and promote
humor. Unfortunately, the pro-
ducers of the Thanksgiving Spe-

their advantage. The transitions
between clips are stark, black
screens that are quickly replaced
by the start of the next sketch.
Little to no planning seemed
to have occurred for the order-
ing of the sketches, either. Aside
from the attempted central theme
of Thanksgiving, no cohesion
exists between one sketch and the
next. With different casts in each
sketch, producers could have gone
in chronological order or played
with an ordering that allowed,
and promoted, the continuation
of either a type of character or
similar situational humor. The
disjointedness is distracting from
the great material.
"Saturday Night Live" is in
the TV big leagues, and this spe-
cial reminded us why. Years of
producing a show each week has
resulted in a litany of hilarious
sketches. The Thanksgiving Spe-
cial brought up feelings of nostal-
gia for casts of the past and made
us believe in the potential that the
current, as well as future, seasons
hold.

a series to rival Netflix, and other

The series, produced exclu-

and written by Josh Stoddard and
Evan Endicott, tackles the world
of Silicon Valley start-ups and
the-next-big-thing mentality of
app developers in a tech-infused
landscape. Following four friends
and colleagues, the series focuses
on the development of a Facebook-
like social media app, "brb," that
goes a step further. As one charac-
ter aptly describes, "It's a stalker's
wet dream."
The app doesn't make a whole
lot of sense, which hampers the
pilot but becomes less important

there will be a showcase of

"Shangri-La: Architecture,

famed art collector Doris Duke.
Then, Christiane Gruber,
associate professor of Islamic
art, who recently organized a
symposium on the art of the
Arab Spring uprisings, will be

The next generation is fully

a whimper than with triumphant
fanfare.

reviews, the average aggregate

high light levels, so any of our
wood objects, any of our tex-
tiles, the light levels are too
high," Johnson said. "So we
could only show things that are
metal, are glass, are ceramics."
But with the only constraint
being a material one, Johnson
had a wide variety of pieces
to pick from while curating
the exhibit. She followedthe
interests of the family who
originally brought the pieces
to the University. According to
Johnson, much of the collec-
tion was collected by former
University president Alexander
Grant Ruthven and the Ruth-
ven family. Ruthven focused on
the aesthetic - the big, beauti-
ful objects that had very ornate
details.
"That's kind of how we chose
some of our pieces, for their aes-
thetic quality, the beauty of the
objects even though they were
used for everyday use," Johnson
said.
The title of the exhibit -
"Fragments of the Past" - is
appropriate as many of the
pieces are literally fragments of
larger objects worn from use.
"There are a number of glass
shards that have very intricate
detail on them, but they still
give clues to the cultural back-
ground of the pieces, the influ-
ence of culture," Johnson said.

It isn't that surprising that
something like a glass bowl
might be very intricate and
detailed. But even objects used
for more rigorous tasks were
endowed with beauty by their
creators.
"There are these beautiful
ceramic filters, and there's very
ornate detail on them, but they
were used to filter the Nile,"
Johnson said. "The Nile is, and
always has been, very dirty, so
it's a very functional piece, but
you also see that the artisan
gave amazing attention to that."
The artisans of the Islamic
world endowed the mundane
objects of their daily lives with
beauty. Now, "Fragments of the
Past" will take these objects
and appreciate them for the art
that they are and always have
been.
At the very least, this exhibi-
tion will allow viewers to appre-
ciate Islamic art as it exists
beyond the mosques and mosa-
ics. But after appreciating the
beauty of a humble water filter,
perhaps viewers will appreci-
ate the beauty of the mundane
objects of the present.
"It's kind of this dialogue
that's happening from the past
to the present in response, and
I thinks that's something that's
really important at the Univer-
sity,"'Johnson said.

The film excels in establishing

Dench's creation of Philomena
as that sweet old lady everyone
knows: The one who offers toffees
in the car, who doesn't understand
puns and kindheartedly tries to
connect with her Mexican waiter

by expressing her love of tacos.
Do not mistake Philomena as
just a caricature. Through her
soulful eyes and deliberate move-
ments, Dench instills in her a quiet
pain: Her voice never rises to a yell,
and even when she breaks down,
her dignity stays intact. Religion
stays an important theme as Phil
goes head-to-head with Martin,
facing off his rants about God and
the Pope with her ferocious faith.
The dichotomy between the two
of them can at times come off as
too strong - a studied depiction
of new vs. old - but the excellent
acting by both Dench and Coogan
ensures that Phil and Martin are
fully developed.
The film, based on a true story,
only falters in itsstorytellingdevic-
es. Gray-lit flashbacks show Phil's
loss; the camera focuses two inches
fromher facetoshowthe single tear
dripping down her cheek. Dench
narrates these flashbacks herself,
andher daintybrogue negatesfrom
the severity of the situation. The
story itself is dramatic, but every
time the film dips into melodra-
ma, Philomena loses some of her
authenticity. The music detracts
from the story as well, playing the
frenzied tones of a murder mystery.
It simply doesn't match the story's
nuanced examination of a woman
torn apart but still full of forgive-
ness.
"Philomena" delicately portrays
a woman already in the twilight of
her life, who still yearns to change
her past. Phil isn't brilliant, she isn't
educated or witty, not even par-
ticularly perceptive. Phil is simply
a woman conflicted between what
was taken from her and the faith
that has remained throughout her
entire life. Dench seems to go in a
softer direction with "Philomena,"
but Phil is possibly her most badass
character yet: a forgiving woman
with dignity and grace, one who
doesn't pretend tobe someone she
is not.

Paul Rudd ("Clueless") and
Steve Carell ("Despicable Me
2") have made their careers out
of playing nice guys, the ones
moms love and teenaged book-
worms swoon over. It's notable
then that they both attribute
"Anchorman: The Legend of
Ron Burgundy" as their favor-
ite film, despite playing less
than relatable characters. In a
conference call The Michigan
Daily took part in, Rudd and
Carell discussed the upcoming
sequel, "Anchorman 2: The Leg-
end Continues," which releases
December 20.
Rudd reprises his role as
Brian Fantana, a heavily mus-
tachioed, wannabe lothario.
Carell returns as Brick Tam-
land, a simple man who can only
communicate by yelling random
words and phrases. To this day
Carell says that fans repeat
Brick's famous nonsensical line,
"I love lamp," more than any of
his other quotes.
The original 2004 film, creat-
ed and directed by Adam Mckay
("The Other Guys"), wildly
successful when it came out,
has developed an even greater
cult following since. Will Fer-

rell starred as Ron Burgundy,
an overblown and incompe-
tent news anchor in 1970s San
Diego. Rudd and Carell starred
as members of his intrepid gang
of reporters.
"Part of the spirit of what
happened on the first 'Anchor-
man,"' Rudd said, "Was that it
felt like an indie movie. It just
felt like a very small kind of
corky comedy that we thought
was funny, that did not seem
particularly commercial."
Both films boast avast array
of comedic guest stars, includ-
ing Ben Stiller and Vince
Vaughn (in the original), Har-
rison Ford, Kristen Wiig, Tina
Fey and many others in the
sequel. Rudd and Carell attri-
bute Mckay as the reason so
many stars are drawn to these
quirky films.
"I think people were sort of
calling Adam and Will to get
into the movie," Carell said.
"I don't think there was much
arm-bending to get people in ...
People just wanted to be part of
the silliness."

hype leading up to the sequel is
irrepressible.
Fans even fought for the film
to be turned into a musical, an
idea Carell says he found inter-
esting but ultimately impos-
sible. One of the memorable
scenes of the original is when
Ferrell, Rudd, Carell and David
Koechner, the fourth member
of their crew, sing an acapella
version of "Afternoon Delight."
"The part Iwas excited about
with a musical," Carell said,
"was the fact that at any given
moment, the characters could
just break into song. The idea
of that happening - it's just
great."
Ten years
later, people
still quote the
comedy classic.

f filming Both are tight-lipped about
re money the new film, but they say that
imagined. the official trailer, which has
its release, already been viewed over 1.1
a regularly million times, doesn't give
y, and the the best parts away. The air of
mystery surrounding the film
- keeping shooting schedules
and cameos a secret, not giv-
ing away much of the plot - is
intentional on the part of the
actors and filmmakers. They
don't want the film to lose any
of its hype.
"I want people to have ques-
tions going into this," Rudd
said. "I want people to feel
about this the way they feel
about 'Lost in Translation,' in
a way."
"You know, you look at the
trailer and you think, wow,
that's - they put everything in
that they could, and that's the
entire movie," Carell said. "But
there's so much more (here)
than is in the trailer, and it's
funnier. So I'm kind of psyched
about the whole thing."
Since the original was
released in 2004, both of these
actors have blown up, gone on
to star on TV and in comedic
and dramatic movies alike.
They are not only happy, but
ecstatic, to return as Burgun-
dy's bumbling sidekicks once
again.
"For me, mainly it was like
working with these guys again
who I love," Rudd said. "And,
you know, it was such a blast
doing the first one that I would
jump at the chance to come
back and beat a dead horse."
"We all just wanted to do it
for the sake of doing it, and I
think we all would have done it
in a vacuum." Carell said. "Even
if there was no film, we would
PARAMOUNT have come back and done it,

Last April, Robinson held

13 season at the '4,' a position
similar to the power forward
that, in the Beilein offense,
demands passivity. The '4,' as
Robinson plays it, awaits his
opportunities. He doesn'tgen-
erate possessions but finishes
them, depending on the guards'
decisions on a given play. The '4'
hangs out in the corners, waiting
for the wings to penetrate and
attract attention, looking for a
pass. The '4' crashes the boards
for put-backs and makes back-
door cuts for alley-oops, layups
and short jump shots. The '4'
waits for his chances, he doesn't
create them.
With Trey Burke, Tim Hard-
away Jr. and Nik Stauskas in
the backcourt, it made sense for
the bigger, 6-foot-6, 220-pound
Robinson to find his way into

the starting lineup as the '4.' But
when he made his decision in
April, he was intent on moving
to the '3' this season. At the new
position where he could create
his own shot and drive to the
rim consistently, he'd be able to
showcase all he could do on the
court.
Beilein understood this. He
knew the player with the highest
ceiling needed to be given the
chance to shine, and he said so.
"We've always envisioned him
to be the '3' man," Beilein said
last April.
That couldn't happen last year
because it was more a matter
of, "How do we get our best five
guys on the floor as much as pos-
sible?"
Reasonable enough. So this
season, Robinson would play
the '3.' It wasn't a deal, per se,
because Beilein has too much
integrity to pull something like
that, but it seemed like an unspo-
ken agreement. To reward his
star player who had foregone the
pros to return to school, Rob-
inson would get to play the '3,'
where he could flash his offen-
sive creativity and flex his abili-
ties beyond jaw-dropping dunks.
Trouble was, it's not that
simple. The Wolverines still had
to find a way to get the best five
guys on the floor, and the way
to do that was to keep Robin-
son at the '4.' Michigan's depth
lies with its backcourt and not
its frontcourt. For Robinson to
play the '3,' two big men need to
start, but outside of sophomore
forward Mitch McGary, no other
big is amongthe team's best five.
In Michigan's exhibitions
earlier this year, Beilein tried to
make the two-big-man set-up
work. With McGary out, red-
shirt junior Jon Horford and
fifth-year senior Jordan Morgan
started, and as expected, Robin-
son flourished at the '3,' explod-
ing for 33 points on 12-for-15
shooting in a 117-44 victory
over Concordia. He'd score an
efficient 15 points the next game
against Wayne State.'
Then the five-best-guys-on-

potential best player is being
constrained from realizing his
full abilities. Ideally, Michigan
would be able to let Robinson
maximize his abilities. With cur-
rent personnel, that's not reality.
For a player dogged by a
reputation for being passive and
pass-first, the position change
doesn't help Robinson shed that
label. This season, Robinson has
looked tentative and caged while
never the go-to option for Michi-
gan late in games. Stauskas,
playingthe '3,' took over that
role. In the three games decided
by less than 10 points, Robinson
shot 9-for-26 and 2-for-9 from
behind the arc. He bruised his
back in the second half of a 63-61
loss to Charlotte in the Puerto
Rico Tip-Off Final and was held
out of the final 18 minutes of the
contest. Robinson has been a
shell of what he was presumed
capable of.
But then Friday in a blowout
win against Coppin State, an
ankle injury to Stauskas allowed
Robinson to play the '3' again. It
was a small sample size against
an inferior team, but he looked
comfortable again, scoring 14
points on 5-for-11 shooting.
It's a complicated issue. You
can't blame Beilein for not com-
promising in playing the team's
five best players, though perhaps
you can fault him for lacking the
foresight that given the team
composition, the '3' wouldn't be
available to Robinson. Unless
Beilein was truly astounded
that LeVert was able to earn a
starting spot, he could have laid
out the situation to Robinson
in April. And maybe he did. But
unfiltered honesty could have
meant Robinson would punch
his ticket to Brooklyn for the
draft.
Michigan's five best players
don't include a natural '4,' and
that's at the heart of the issue.
It's the position that has put
John Beilein ina tough position.

Sophomore forward Glenn Robinson Ill is stuck in the middle of two positions, the '3' and the '4.'

the-floor issue reared itself as
the regular season was set to
begin. Sophomore guard Caris
LeVert played so well in the pre-
season that Beilein couldn't keep
him out of the starting lineup.
The best five players were fresh-
man point guard Derrick Wal-
ton, LeVert, Stauskas, Robinson
and McGary. Not much dispute
about it.
So for the rest of the season,
barring injury, Robinson's stuck
at the '4.' To shoe-horn Robin-
son into the '3' requires a two-
big-man set, something Beilein

doesn't see as anything more
than a situational option.
The philosophical problem is
that the interests of the guy that
could potentially be Michigan's
best player don't align with the
interests of the team.
Robinson certainly won't
voice displeasure with the situ-
ation. He's said that he's willing
and happy to play wherever is
best for the team. Whether he is
the consummate team guy and is
willing to sacrifice a great deal
of production for the good of the
team, or if he's simply providing

lip service, is open to interpreta-
tion.
But a reasonable person who
passed up a spot in the lottery
of the NBA Draft to return to
school with the stated purpose
of playing a specific position
would be upset about playing
elsewhere out of necessity. The
situation could cost Robinson
millions depending on how his
draft stock is altered.
But it's not just Robinson
personally who is affected by
the circumstances. It's also to
Michigan's detriment that its

Michigan'st
season ends
in Elit Eight

 MWOMEN'S BASKETBALL
'M' falls short of upset

By JAKE LOURIM
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's soc-
cer team spent all season break-
ing records - best start to a
season, best Big Ten finish, most
shutouts.
But on Friday, it finally ran
into an MICHIGAN 1
offense VIRGINIA 2
that broke
its own.
No. 1 seed Virginia notched
the go-ahead goal in the 68th
minute to eliminate Michigan
from the NCAA Tournament in
the Elite Eight, 2-1.
The Cavaliers (24-1) came in
with the nation's top offense at
3.13 goals per game, so Michigan
(18-4-1) countered with a 5-3-2
formation. It pushed freshman
Madisson Lewis from outside
midfielder to forward, and the
holding midfielder into the back
line.
"Virginia throws the kitchen
sink at you, and a couple of pipes
from the basement and a crow-
bar from the back ofyour trunk,"
said Michigan coach Greg Ryan.
"You've got to be able to deal
with so many attacking options
that they have. We decided that
if we were going to give them
anything, give them the flanks,
not up the middle. Unfortunate-
ly, we were out of position on
that first goal in one spot, but it
happens."
In the 24th minute, Virginia
became the first team to score
on the Wolverines in the NCAA
Tournament. Forward Makenzy
Doniak fed a pass into the box
for midfielder Morgan Brian,
who poked it past Michigan
freshman goalie Taylor Bucklin.
The goal came on the Cava-
liers' sixth shot of the game. On
the previous five shots, the Wol-

verines stopped a shot and tried
to clear it, but a Virginia player
was right there to keep it in the
Michigan half.
The Wolverines fought back,
sticking to their game plan of
playing defense and scoring on
counter attacks.
In the 28th minute, Bucklin
prevented a 2-0 deficit by catch-
ing a point-blank shot and send-
ing it the other way.-In the far
corner, senior forward Nkem
Ezurike pushed over a Virginia
defender, gained possession and
crossed it to senior midfielder
Meghan Toohey for the finish.
"After they scored, we hud-
dled together and said we need-
ed to keep going after it and not
let it affect our play," Toohey
said.
Despite being pounded from
all angles, Michigan went into
halftime tied and played an
even game in the beginning of
the second half, with neither
team allowing any chances. In
the 68th minute, Virginia for-
ward Molly Menchel shot the
ball off the post and then put the
rebound in to give the Cavaliers
the lead that would hold for the
remainder of
the game. -
"I think we
did well for a "They

said senior l
defender
Holly Hein. -
"They put
a couple in behind us, but we
really fought the whole game to
make sure they weren't able to
get behind us. They did a couple
times, but that's the way it goes
sometimes in soccer."

Ryan walked into his press

congratulating Virginia, his
players' sniffles audible in the
background. He had to make his
way out of a somber team huddle
before talking to the media.
"They didn't want to leave,"
Ryan said. "They said, 'We're

1. This isn't Bo and Woody's
rivalry
Three years into the Ten Year
War, Bo Schembechler faced a
choice much like Brady Hoke's
on Saturday. This time, the script
was reversed. Schembechler's
team was undefeated. A tie would
send it to the Rose Bowl.
Late in the game, down three
points, Schembechler had two
consecutive plays from Ohio
State's 1-yard line. Earlier in the
game, Woody Hayes's Ohio State
defense stuffed Michigan on four
straight runs on the goal line.
But on third down, Schem-
bechier called another run up the
middle. No gain.
So on fourth down, he faced a
choice: a tie and the Rose Bowl
berth, or go for it for the win.
Schembechler went for it, another
run up the middle. No gain again.
It was a situation much like
Michigan's failed two-point
attempt on Saturday. That's
where the similarities end.
Schembechler and Hayes prob-
ably wouldn't have recognized
this weekend's iteration of The
Game. Michigan's 41 points were
the most ever scored by the los-
ing team in this rivalry. During
the Ten Year War, the most points
scored by the losing team was 14.
Michigan scored that many points
before the first quarter ended.
The modern version of The
Game is a high-scoring, offense-
dominated affair. Here's a sam-
pling of some of the many records
broken in Michigan's 42-41 loss
Saturday:
- The combined 1,129 total
yards are the most ever accumu-
lated in the rivalry. For Michi-
gan, it's the sixth-most combined
yards against any team.
- The combined score of 83
points is second only to Michi-
gan's 86-0 win over Ohio State in
1902.

- This was the rivalry's first
one-point game since 1926, when
Michigan won 17-16 in Columbus.
* Redshirt junior quarterback
Devin Gardner's 451 yards is the
highest passing total against the
Buckeyes in Michigan history,
breaking Tom Brady's record of
375 in 1998. Only Gardner's 503
passing yards against Indiana this
year surpasses Saturday's mark.
- Gardner's 32 completions is
Michigan's highest completion
total against Ohio State, again
breaking Brady's record of 31 in
1998. It's two completions shy of
the overall Michigan record.
" Gardner's four touchdown
passes are a Michigan record in
this rivalry.
- Fifth-year seniorwide receiv-
er Jeremy Gallon's 175 receiv-
ing yards are a Michigan record
in the rivalry, passing Braylon
Edwards's 172 yards in 2004.
- Gallon's 84-yard screen pass
and run is the longest Michigan
play against Ohio State ever.
- Ohio State's average of 8.6
yards per play is not only a Buck-
eye record forThe Game, it is also

the highest average of any Michi-
gan opponent ever.
* The Buckeyes' 393 rushing
yards is their highest total against
Michigan ever, breaking their
mark of 381in 1995.
- Ohio State's average of 8.5
yards per rush is the most in Ohio
State history.
- Michigan's 99-yard touch-
down drive, of course, is a rivalry
record, a program record and a
national record, tied with many.
This is not an exhaustive list.
Michigan and Ohio State have
met 110 times since 1897. The
game Saturday is simply unprec-
edented.
2. But the rivalry is as strong as
ever.
Let's talk about the fight. Three
ejections, multiple punches, four
flags on the ground. Then there
was Hoke running onto the field,
Marcus Hall's double-middle-
finger salute to the Michigan
Stadium crowd and Royce Jen-
kins-Stone's helmet throw.
It's nice to know that these

teams still hate each other.
"It's always a war," Gallon said
after the game. "It's not even a
game, it's awar."
So the hate is still there, and
the games are as good as ever.
One byproduct of the offensive
explosion in the modern era of
The Game is that the play is more
exciting. Ignoring the stakes, the
2013 version of the rivalry was
the most thrilling game ever. The
1969 game was an improbable
upset, but the 24-12 game was
lackluster in comparison. The
2006 game was high-scoring and
had national title implications,
but Michigan couldn't get the ball
to attempt a final drive.
Ohio State has owned the
series, recently, but it has also
been symmetrically even. By
John Cooper's final game, Ohio
State had only won two of the last
13 meetings. Now, since Cooper,
there have been 13 games. This
time, Michigan has won only two.
Ohio State claims a slight edge in
that 26-year span, at 11-2 to Mich-
igan's 10-2-1.
And since Hoke has taken over?
Ohio State has won two out of
three, but the overall score is tied
102-102.
3. It's official, Gardner is hurt.
Gardner had a gutsy, efficient
performance against Ohio State.
He also did it on one leg. After the
game, he hobbled into his press
conference wearing a boot on his
left foot.
Last week, Gardner appeared
to hurt his right shoulder. Still,
Gardner hasn't missed a snap
because of injury. (He sat out late
against Michigan State but likely
would have gone if the game was
in reach.)
"He's beat up like everybody
is," Hoke said. "And when he was
limping a little bit, I said, 'I don't
want to see you limp. Every guy
out here can limp. We got to go
play.' He did that, and I'm proud
of him."

4. Pint-sized Gallon still has bar-
rels of talent.
Gallon had another typical day
against the Buckeyes. He caught
an 84-yard screen pass early in
the game. Later, he made a char-
acteristic leaping touchdown
grab to put Michigan ahead 21-14.
He finished with nine receptions.
When the offensive line has
given Gardner time, Gallon has
been one of the most proficient
Michigan receivers ever. He tied
a Michigan record with a recep-
tion in 38 straight games. He now
has 1,284yards this season, which
is second in program history and
just 46 yards behind Edwards's
record of 1,330. He is also fourth
on Michigan's all-time receptions
list with 164.
5. Bowl-d prediction: Still B-Dubs
bound.
The bold prediction in this
same columnwas a spot for Mich-
igan in the Buffalo Wild Wings
Bowl. Now that the regular sea-
son is over, it's staying the same.
Assuming Ohio State and
Michigan State go to BCS bowls,
that puts Wisconsin in the Capital
One Bowl and likely Iowa in the
Outback Bowl.
The Buffalo Wild Wings
Bowl picks next, and it will like-
ly choose between Michigan,
Nebraska and Minnesota. A week
ago, the choice would've probably
been Nebraska. But Michigan's
strong showing in a loss this week
could change things.
Michigan beat Minnesota and
travels well, so the Wolverines
have the edge. Nebraska beat
Michigan and finished two games
ahead in the Legends Division,
but the Cornhuskers finished a
disappointing season with some
calling for a coaching change.
Michigan's game against the
Buckeyes could convince some
fans to head to Arizona, maybe
enough to win over the bowl com-
mittee.

From Page 1B
The game appeared to be get-
ting out of reach on the second
drive of the second half, when
Gardner fumbled on a third-
down run and Ohio State recov-
ered the ball near midfield.
Buckeye quarterback Braxton
Miller scored his fourth touch-
down of the day five plays later

to give the Buckeyes a 28-21 lead.
The Buckeyes ripping off huge
chunks of yards on the ground
was a theme of the day. Run-
ning back Carlos Hyde bullied
his way through the middle of
the defense for 226 yards on 27
carries, good for 8.4 yards per
carry. Miller underthrew three
receivers in the first quarter and
finished the game with just 133
passing yards, but ran for 153
yards and was responsible for

five touchdowns.
As a team, Ohio State ran for
393 yards on 46 carries - 8.5
yards per carry.
Still, it was Hyde that gave
Michigan a new chance when
he fumbled near midfield half-
way through the fourth quarter
with the Wolverines down seven.
Gardner then led a 13-play drive
capped off by a touchdown pass
to freshman tight end Jake Butt.
But Ohio State's offense con-

tinued to blast through the Mich-
igan defense, going on a six play,
65-yard drive to regain the lead
with just more than two minutes
left in the game. Michigan scored
on another Gardner touchdown
pass, but the interception on the
conversion sealed the game.
"This is a special game," Hoke
said. "It's the greatest rivalry
there is in any sport. They know
the importance of it. I liked their
demeanor all week.... They were

trying to get better and know
their opponent. I was pleased
with that and had a good feeling
they were going to play they way
they did today."
With the loss, Michigan's
record drops to 7-5 - the same
record that former coach Rich
Rodriguez finished with in his
last season at Michigan before
getting fired and the worst of
Hoke's three-year tenure in Ann
Arbor.

But Hoke went for it.
It was a rub route, the same
one they practiced this week.
Gardner in the shotgun, with
Devin Funchess, Jeremy Gal-
lon and Drew Dileo stacked
to his right. Funchess ran a
post, Gallon an out. It was
supposed to create space for
Dileo, the little, sure-handed
receiver who always seems to
be forgotten until the biggest
moments. Dileo would surely
make the catch, because he
always does.
But Tyvis Powell jumped
the route. Dileo never had a
chance.

Maybe you allowed yourself
to think this will be a game
after all, after the screen to
Gallon on the first drive. The
fight, Hoke running out to sep-
arate his players, the punches
and the double middle fingers
made it personal.
Hoke went for it because he
wanted it as bad as his players.
He wanted it as bad as Gard-
ner, who threw a touchdown
pass to Dileo down 14 in the
fourth quarter. Afterward,
Gardner tried to run off the
field, limping so badly he
nearly fell over on the sideline.
Taylor Lewan came off limp-
ing after that play too, and
bloody again. Most of these
players are playing through
injury because they don't care
how many losses they have.
They just want to beat Ohio
State.
By the time Carlos Hyde
fumbled, and the clock showed
plenty of time, and Gardner
was fighting with everything
he had left and the breaks
started turning Michigan's
way, a ripple went through the
stadium.
Then Jake Butt scored and
then Funchess, and then the
timeout and it seemed like
destiny.
It was a hell of a death, but it
was a hell of a game too, right
up until the end. For the best
three hours of the year, 7-4
Michigan was on top of the
world.
So Hoke went for it. It was
ballsy, and it was risky, and
it didn't work out. But that's
what you do when what you
want is right there to take.
You go for it. You go for it
every damn time.

DEFENSE
From Page 1B
ing decision in the final minute
included.
In fact, the decision wasn't even
Hoke's alone.
Fifth-year senior offensive line-
man Taylor Lewan, who also said
he regretted nothing about his
decision to return for another sea-
son, mentioned that Hoke asked
the seniors on the sideline during a
timeout if they wanted to attempt
the two-point conversion. And
according to Lewan, the decision
was unanimous.
"I don't think there was one guy
that said no," an extremely emo-
tional Lewan said. "Every single
person said yes. We're behind
these coaches 100 percent. We
fight for them and our brothers."
In the back of their minds, or in
Hoke's case, the front, was Michi-
gan's inability to stop the run all
afternoon. Buckeye running back
Carlos Hyde set a program record
for rushing yards against the Wol-
verines with 229. Hyde consistent-
ly found holes to run through up
the middle. Quarterback Braxton
Miller was equally untouchable,
running for three touchdowns and
an average of 9.6 yards per carry.
Hoke knew that, should the
game go into overtime, his team's
chances of suddenly figuring out
how to stop the Ohio State ground
game were likely slim. He liked
the rejuvenated offense's chances
of picking up the necessary three
yards better.
Not to mention, the team was
without fifth-year senior kicker
Brendan Gibbons, who tweaked
something in practice Tuesday,
according to Hoke. Filling in was
junior Matt Wile, who was per-
fect on five extra-point attempts,
though a couple of them were
shaky.
By now you know the rest of the

story: the redshirt junior Gard-
ner's pass, intended for senior
wide receiver Drew Dileo, was
intercepted, and the game was lost
in regulation.
And even though a reporter
informed Hoke that, in an infor-
mal poll, 75 percent of fans agreed
with his decision to go for two
("Great, now I'm really screwed,"
Hoke deadpanned back), had
the defense shown an ability to
get a stop, the game would have
continued into overtime. Half of
the Buckeyes' possessions ended
in the end zone, all but two of
those touchdowns coming on the
ground.
"We need to definitely improve
our running game," said redshirt
junior linebacker Jake Ryan. "That
was one thing that stuck out."
The Buckeyes had difficultly
completing passes, going 6-for-15
through the air, but went uncon-
tested on the ground, consistently
entering the second level en route
to 393 total rushing yards.
But the decision to go for two
wasn't solely made because Hoke
lacked confidence in the defense's
ability to stop, or at least slow
downy the Ohio State backfield
threats.
"We play the game to .win,"
Hoke said. "I thought about it, and
we (decided to)."
Added Gardner: "We felt like we
could win the game rightthere."
To the surprise of most every-
body, they could have. And so, in
some ways, it felt like the Wol-
verines were playing with house
money.
In 1968, after scoring a mean-
ingless two-point conversion after
a rout of Michigan, former Ohio
State coach Woody Hayes, asked
about the decision, famously said
he made it "because I couldn't go
for three."
Unlike with Hayes's, though,
Hoke's bold decision had nothing
to lose and everything to gain.

packed Yost Ice

season, viewers tuned in from
areas that aren't exposed to col-

again fought with each other.
"I thought a lot of our players
might have gotten caught up in
all the hoopla and all the expec-
tations, rather than just playing
the game hard," said Michigan
coach Red Berenson after Fri-
day's game. "But it feels good to
win that game."
So can Monday's contest in
Columbus exceed, if not match,
Friday's excitement?
After Friday, it will be a ques-
tion of which offense shows up.
Michigan ( 1-0 Big Ten, 9-2-1
overall) has scored at least four
goals in three consecutive games
after averaging less than three
goals per game prior to that
stretch.

Big Ten football is known for
its gritty, smash-mouth style
replete with rivalries and tradi-
tion. Friday, the conference's
inaugural hockey season got off
to a similarly enticing start.
No. 3 Michigan has made a
habit of winning close games this
year, and it seemed to be head-
ing toward another such vic-
tory when it hosted Ohio State
at Yost Ice Arena. But with just
three minutes remaining, for-
ward Anthony Greco finally took
advantage of one of several defen-
sive miscues by the Wolverines
and one-timed a shot past fresh-
man goaltender Zach Nagelvoort.
But minutes later in overtime,
Michigan (1-0 Big Ten, 9-2-1
overall) sent the sellout crowd
into a frenzy. Sophomore for-
ward Andrew Copp received a
long pass from senior defenseman
Mac Bennett in stride and sliced
through the Buckeyes' zone. A
low, accurate wrister past net-
minder Logan Davis on his block-
er side ensured the Wolverines
were 4-3 victors and unbeaten in
Big Ten hockey's one-day history.
It was a wild, unpredictable
game. Or, as junior forward Alex
Guptill explained, what everyone
expects all year long from confer-
ence play.
"It was a lot of fun tonight,
that's for sure," Guptill said.
The second period brought out
the very best of the uninterrupt-
ed rivalry between the former
CCHA foes. With the score knot-
ted at one, Michigan freshman
center JT Compher drew acrucial
penalty for being checked into the
goal by forward Alex Szczechura.
The two tussled while crammed
into the net as players from both
sides had to be separated by team-
mates and refs.
"I'm just usually a feisty player,

so getting into it is nothing new
for me," Compher said.
Fittingly, it was the center him-
self who capitalized on the power
play. Senior forward Luke Mof-
fatt's blazing shot caromed into
the slot, and Compher poked the
rebound into the empty net for his
third goal of the season as Michi-
gan retook the lead.
With just 17 seconds left in the
period, the freshman stamped
his mark on the Wolverines' first
official Big Ten game. This time,
Compher won a faceoff cleanly
and reached over a defender to
slide the puck over to Guptill, who
ripped a rising shot that found
twine.
"We had some really good indi-
vidual efforts in the game, (and)
JT was one of those players," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"He competed hard in every shift
and he got rewarded for it."
The battle in the trenches
often dictates a football game,
and Ohio State (0-1, 7-2) certain-
ly did its share of the dirty work
as it kept the fans at Yost on the
edges of their seats. The Buckeyes
scored on both of their power-
play opportunities and blocked 17
shots in the first period alone.
Ultimately, the Wolverines
managed 38 shots on target, and
they needed all four goals to pull
out the dramatic win.
"I wish we could play them
every game," Guptill said.
They can't, but the scheduling
implications of a six-team confer-
ence ensure that-the rivalry will
have plenty of time to intensify.
The two will meet again Mon-
day night in Columbus and twice
more later in the year before a
potential rematch in the Big Ten
Tournament.
But with No. 1 Minnesota, No.
12 Wisconsin and natural rival
Michigan State in the conference,
nearly every game could have the
makings of an instant classic.

Copp is tied with Ohio State
forward Ryan Dzingel for the
Big Ten's scoring lead with eight
goals this season.
Junior forward Alex Guptill
and freshman forward JT Com-
pher each recorded a goal and
an assist in the win, solidify-
ing another line which includes
freshman Tyler Motte, junior
Phil Di Giuseppe and Copp. Along
with senior forward Derek DeB-
lois, Guptill and Compher's line
tallied 12 shots for ateam lead.
The Buckeyes' offense follow-
ing Friday still sits ninth in the
nation with 3.5 goals per game
after exposing an inexperienced
Wolverine defense. There were
instances when freshman defen-
seman Michael Downing didn't
keep his stick on the ice to stop a

shot or when no one crashed the
net to clear out an easy pass from
the boards.
But Ohio State scored only one
goal at even strength, capitalizing
on both of Michigan's penalties.
Junior forward Andrew
Sinelli started on defense in Fri-
day's game after junior defense-
men Brennan Serville and Mike
Szuma were scratched due to
injuries. Even before the loss of
freshman defenseman Kevin
Lohan in October, the Wolver-
ines' defense has struggled to
shut down offensesowithout being
rescued by its goaltender.
Freshman netminder Zach
Nagelvoort got the start Friday,
but Berenson has hinted that
sophomore goaltender Steve
Racine could see time Monday.

Racine hasn't seen action since
Nov. 16 after an injury kept him
out for nearly a month.
But Michigan's biggest prob-
lem could be the early week
game, marking the first time any
current Wolverine has played on
Monday night. It won't be a regu-
lar occurrence to see Michigan
play on a Monday, but with TV
stations sweeping up rights and
the football game Saturday, the
Wolverines had few options.
"It's alittlebit strange because
we're so used playing Friday
and Saturday,")aid senior defen-
seman MacBennett.
And after the win on Friday,
Michigan is certainly hoping it
had the chance to play Saturday
and ride the momentum from a
classic Big Ten game.
