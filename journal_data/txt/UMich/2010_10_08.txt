'U' alum Chris
Farah directed
'Answer This'
By ANDREW LAPIN
Senior Arts Editor
Students and faculty of a cer-
tain age may be familiar with

seeing the face of retired Eng-
lish Prof. Ralph Williams around
campus. But in recent weeks he's
been increasingly prominent in a
different incarnation: as an illus-
tration adorning a bright yellow
canvas, the words "Yea/Nay?"
displayed beneath his grinning
visage.
The posters are promoting the
new film "Answer This!" (former-

ly titled "Trivial Pursuits"), a fea-
ture-length production centering
around a grad student immersed
in bar trivia. The film was shot
entirely in Ann Arbor and places
Williams in a featured role. It's
premiering at the Michigan The-
ater tonight and promoting Wil-
liams's participation to the fullest
extent, even marketing T-shirts
featuring his face.

"Sometimes I wonder if our
main contribution to society
is going to be getting him on
T-shirts and people are going to
forget about the movie by like
next year," joked writer-director
Chris Farah in an interview with
the Daily. "People love that shirt."

Google is competing

for IT revamp
By NATHAN RANNS
For theDaily
Google representatives led a
demonstration last night to try
to entice a crowd of nearly 70
University students and faculty
to "Go Google."
The University's Unit IT
Steering Committee has plans
to implement a new IT system

in an effort to improve campus
communication and Google and
Microsoft are competing to win
the votesof University comput-
er users who will help decide
which company will be chosen
for the new system.
The five speakers from Google
stressed the positive aspects of
the version of the Google Prod-
uct Suite that Google crafted
specifically for the University.
During the event - which was
held at the Biomedical Science
Research Building - the Google
representatives discussed the
interactivity and integration
that Google Product Suite, also
referred to as the Google Apps

system, would offer users.
According to Google Prod-
uct Manager Ronald Ho, the
program is similar to Google
Documents, in which users have
the ability to instantly generate
spreadsheets and documents
and view real-time feedback.
Users will also be able to make
and share websites and calen-
dars.

* GREEK LIFE
Panhel, IFC see spike in new members

Officials attribute
growth to largest
freshmen class
in 'U' history
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
Over the past two weeks many
sororities and fraternities on
campus have completed their

formal recruitment process with
participation far exceeding previ-
ous years.
This semester, 545 men accept-
ed hids for Interfraternity Coun-
cil fraternities and 790 women
became a part of the Panhel-
lenic Association - combined
that's270 more students than last
year. Members of the organiza-
tions' executive boards said the
spike in new members is due to
the University's larger freshman
class as well as a nationwide trend

of greater interest in Greek life.
LSA senior Lauren Hartstein,
vice president of internal recruit-
ment for Panhel, said that based
on Panhel's records that started
in 1972, this year's number of
pledges is the most on record.
This year, 1,051 women regis-
tered to participate in the Panhel
recruitment process compared to
887 women last year, according
to Hartstein. She added that last
year, 628 women were given bids

Alveda King also.
discussed civil rights
in campus speech
By JEFF WARANIAK
For the Daily
Dr. Alveda King - niece of
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. -
explained why she's changed her
opinion about abortion and her
role as a civil rights activist dur-
ing a speech on campus last night.
In her lecture "How Can the

Dream Survive?" King discussed
how her life has influenced her
outlook on civil rights and her
personal experiences with abor-
tion.
King began her presentation -
a PowerPoint that included family
photos of herself and other rela-
tives with her father - civil rights
activist A.D. William King, Sr.
and her uncle, Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr.
King also recounted her own
experiences with abortion, tell-
ing the audience at the Chemistry
Building that she had two abor-

tions herself and explaining how
she came to be a pro-life advocate
and a born-again Christian.
"I saw an ultrasound and I real-
ized that it was a baby. I could see
the little heart and hands and
said, 'My God, I've been involved
in killing people,"' King said.
"In 1983, I became born again. I
repented for my involvement in
the death of my own babies."
As part of her presentation,
King also promoted a message of
unity around civil rights.

Ralph Williams on his film debut: 'It's hard
for me to play myself doing wrong things'

From Page 1A
degree and returned in 2002 for
his master's in near-eastern stud-
ies, put together the film with the
help of his brother Mike, a co-
producer who is the president of
production at the humor website
Funny or Die. The brothers were
granted permission to film on
campus and use the the Univer-
sity as its setting - a first for any
production - and received full
cooperation during the shoot that
took place in fall 2009.
Several persistent e-mails were
all it took for Farah to convince
Williams to take the role - his
first in a film. Farah was not only
a former student of Williams as
an undergraduate but also a grad-
uate student instructor for his
class, which led to a role-reversal
when it was Farah's turn to direct
his former teacher.

"It was, as I heard the phrase, a
'fast-learning experience,' " Wil-
liams told the Daily.
He added that because he was
playing a character based so
heavily on himself, with his man-
nerisms and personality, he occa-
sionally had disputes with Farah
over the direction his character,
Dr. Elliot Tarson, should take.
"I can, I think, play a person
doing wrong things, but it's hard
for me to play myself doing things
I would never do," he said, refer-
ring to the fact that the character
is portrayed trying to exert con-
trol over the life of his son (Chris
Gorham, TV's "Covert Affairs").
"My great fear, you see, is that
my son, who will be here this Friday
seeing the film, will say, 'Yup, that's
my dad,' " Williams added, laugh-
ing. "I would be deeply chagrined."
The production was granted
access to filming locations previ-

ously off-limits to movie crews,
like the inside of Michigan Stadi-
um during a game. With the help
of Lee Doyle, director of the Uni-
versity's Film Office, scenes were
filmed in the packed Big House
during the 2009 season opener
against Western Michigan.
"I don't know if there's ever a
screening when I see that, that
I don't get choked up in some
capacity," Mike Farah said.
The University was also sur-
prisingly receptive to scenes in
the film depicting certain other
student traditions, he said, like
sex in the stacks at the Graduate
Library.
"They actually went for it.
That was the one thing that I
was worried that they could pro-
test," Chris said. "We shot it in
the frickin' library ... I'm sure if
we had gotten funky or some-
thing like that, they would've said

something."
"I have always been aware that
my students go to the library and
that some of the things they do
there involve study, but I had no
idea of the particular range of
things," Williams deadpanned,
laughing. "So the sex in the
stacks, apparently. ... That was
new to me."
In lieu of an official distribu-
tion deal for the film - though
the Farahs have already sold the
international rights - tonight's
pair of screenings is being billed
as the "Ann Arbor premiere." It's
the first time "Answer This!" will
be shown to a paying audience,
and test-screening-style ques-
tionnaires will be distributed so
viewers can play a hand in further
improving the film in preparation
for its submission to the Sundance
and SXSW festivals next spring.
"It seemed appropriate - for it

to be a Michigan movie - to have
Michigan audiences really have a
hand in shaping that," Chris said.
Asked whether he was worried
the film's appeal would be lim-
ited to audiences in Michigan, he
pointed to the head of the Motion
Picture Association of America,
an Ohio State graduate, who over-
saw "Answer This!" for ratings
consideration and loved the film.
"I'd like to think that there's
kind of a certain Midwestern
pride that hopefully the movie
plays on a little bit that people
from any town anywhere in
America would be able to appreci-
ate," Chris said.
Still, the film is a self-professed
"love letter to Ann Arbor," with a
crew comprised largely of Univer-
sity students, and its promotional
campaign is embracing the city.
A short film contest also entitled
"Love Letters to Ann Arbor"

encouraged people to submit
their own filmed tributes to the
city. The winning filmmaker, LSA
senior David Merian, will have
his short included as a bonus fea-
ture on the eventual DVD.
Made under the state of Mich-
igan's film tax incentive, the
movie is catching the wave of the
local movie boom. And thanks
to its well connected producers,
the story of a University gradu-
ate student unwilling to leave the
city stands a chance of finding
wide success, a rare feat in today's
crowded motion picture industry.
But first the filmmakers have to
find success at home.
"If people from Michigan don't
like this movie, we're kind of
screwed," Chris said.
Leaning forward in his chair,
the always-optimistic Williams
assured, "Yeah, we're gonna look
good."

538 complaints
about smoking ban
The state says local health
departments received 583 com-
plaints about patrons smoking in
restaurants or bars since a smoking
ban covering most Michigan work-
places took effect in May.
The Michigan Department of
Community Health said yesterday
that health departments issued
158 citations to either individuals
or restaurant and bar owners. Vio-
lators face a $100 fine for the first
offense.
MDCH Director Janet Olszews-
ki says the results of a state survey
of health departments shows that
"people are compliant."
The survey covered about 37,000
food service establishments in the
state that fall under the jurisdiction
of 45 health departments in the
state. Data were collected from 37
of the 45 health departments.
Seven counties did not respond.
SEATTLE, Wash.
State ban on inmate
voting upheld
A federal appeals court reversed
course yesterday and upheld Wash-
ington state's ban on voting by pris-
on inmates in a case that challenged
the disproportionate effectithas on
minority voters.
A three-judge panel of the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
caused a stir by ruling in January
that Washington's inmates should
be allowed to vote. That decision
was expected to give momentum
to other efforts to expand voting to
inmates; only Maine and Vermont
allow those behind bars to cast bal-
lots.
But an 11-judge panel reconsid-
ered the case at a hearing in San
Francisco last month and unani-
mously upheld Washington's ban,
which dates to 1866, before state-
hood.
"This ruling affirms the rights of
states to withhold the right to vote
from those who've committed the
most serious crimes against soci-
ety," Washington Attorney General
Rob McKenna said.
HAITIL
1 million refugees
in 1,300 camps
A refugee-advocacy group said
yesterday that more than 70 per-
cent of camps in Haiti, home to an
estimated 1.3 million earthquake
victims, lack proper international
management nearly nine months
after the disaster, leaving them at
increased risk of sexual and gang
violence, hunger and forced evic-
tion.
Washington-based Refugees
International said researchers vis-
iting Haiti found that few of the
roughly 1,300 camps they studied
had International Organization
for Migration-appointed officials
to turn to for help and protection
and are unable to communicate or
coordinate with the international
humanitarian community.

"The people of Haiti are still liv-
ing in a state of emergency, with
a humanitarian response that
appears paralyzed," the Refu-
gees International report said.
"Gang leaders or land owners are
intimidating the displaced. Sexual,
domestic, and gang violence in and
around the camps is rising."
DETROIT
Man delays heart
surgery for game
A devout Michigan State foot-
ball fan called timeout before
doctors could install a pacemaker
in his chest yesterday, deferring
the procedure until after the
school's football game this week-
end against rival Michigan.
Major Hester said he's willing
to risk death so that he can watch
Saturday's game in Ann Arbor
on television. The Spartans are
ranked 17th in the country and
the Wolverines are ranked 18th.
The 69-year-old retired office
supply clerk said he put off
the procedure until next week
because he can't risk something
going wrong on the operating
table that would prevent him
from watching the game.
"You never know," Hester told
The Detroit News as he paced
back and forth in his living room.
"It's like going into combat. You
may come home alive or you may
come home dead."
Hester said he's aware of the
risk he's taking but is willing to
take the chance.

HACKERS
From Page 1A
the morning of Sept. 29 - the
day the site was slated to go live.
According to Halderman, it was
then that the team discovered a
weakness in the site's design that
would allow any good hacker to
infiltrate it.
So Halderman's team decided
to do just that - break into the
site and take control.
"That was the big ah-ha
moment," Halderman said of his
team's late-night discovery.
First, though, the team needed
some rest.
"We spent most of Tuesday
recovering from staying up all
night," Halderman said.
But by Wednesday, Halderman
said, the team was well-rested
and ready to get their hands on
the site, which had since gone
live.
Halderman said that within
hours of hacking into the site,
"we had the same access to the
server as someone who controls
it."
And control it they did.
First, Wustrow said, they
replaced all existing ballots with
write-in votes for famous robots
like HAL 9000.
"It was our own evil ballot,"
Wustrow said.
After that, according to Wus-
trow, the team rigged the system
to reveal personal information
about the people who'd cast their
votes.
And to top it all off, the team
programmed the site to play
"Hail to the Victors" every time a
vote was cast.
"That was our calling card,"
Halderman explained.
Of course, since it was only a
test site for the election, Halder-
man's hacking didn't do any real
damage - quite the opposite, in
fact.
As an official behind the site
explained, the test phase was

to join a Panhel sorority.
Last year, IFC extended bids
to 524 students, with 435 of those
students accepting their bids,
according to LSA senior Brett
Vasicek, vice president of internal
recruitment for IFC. This year,
IFC extended at least one bid to
617 men, he said.
Nationally, there has been a
growinginterestinjoiningGreek-
letter organizations among col-
lege students, Vasicek said.
"Fraternities are becoming
more valued today," he said.
This interest, together with
the largest freshman class size
to date - estimated at 6,300
students by University officials,
according to a Sept. 13 article in
The Michigan Daily - are most
likely the causes for the boost in
recruitees, Vasicek said.
IFC also decided to make
recruitment one week later in the
semester due to Jewish holidays
in September, in addition to hold-
ing another day of events. These
changes may have also led to
more students having an interest
in Greek life on campus as well.
The recruitment process

allows interested students to find
which house is the best fit for
them by having "open houses,"
Vasicek said.
The open Houses are sepa-
rated into categories based on
geographic location, and rush-
ees have the flexibility to choose
which ones they visit, Vasicek
said.
"This is a way to get interested
guys to see as many houses as
possible," he said.
Unlike IFC's open houses, Pan-
hel's recruitment is structured
around four mixers, in which the
recruitees visit all 15 chapters for
the first mixer and a descending
number of houses for each subse-
quent mixer. The last set of mix-
ers, called "preference parties,"
is the most formal of the recruit-
ment events. Each woman in the
recruitment process visits up to
three chapters during this time.
After the last mixer, the women
are given their bids.
Panhel's recruitment process
hasn't change dramatically from
last year, Hartstein said, though
the organization added another
chapter and did more marketing
over the summer.

launched in large part to encour-
age undercover work like Halder-
man's.
In an interview yesterday, Paul
Stenbjorn, the chief technology
officer for the Washington, D.C.
Board of Elections and Ethics,
called the test phase "an exercise
to help us develop a better online
ballot."
According to Stenbjorn, Hal-
derman's hacking helped uncover
a major vulnerability the election
board might have otherwise over-
looked.
"Part of this process was to
ensure that there was no hack-
ability to this application," Sten-
bjorn said.
Thanks to Halderman, Stenb-
jorn said, the online voting sys-
tem is now headed back to the
drawing board.
"I credit (Halderman's team)
with helping us," Stenbjorn said.
"But I also encourage them to
help us build a better one."
However, both Halderman and
Wustrow said they don't want to
play any part in an online voting
system - at least not yet.
"The takeaway we really want
people to see here is that Inter-
net voting is just not ready to be
implemented, definitely not now,"
Wustrow said. "It's a very diffi-
cult problem that can't be solved
fixing just this."
Halderman added that he
was concerned how easy it was
to hack into the site and doesn't
think that bodes well for the
future of online voting.
"Internet voting is really dan-
gerous," Halderman said! "It's
too dangerous toube used today or
any time in the near future."
Nevertheless, Alysohn
McLaughlin, a spokeswoman
from the elections board, said her
group plans to continue develop-
ing its program for use in future
elections.
"We're committed to this
product and we'll continue test-
ing for it," McLaughlin said.
Though Hartstein said she
"would love to attribute" the
increased recruitment numbers
to their marketing, like Vasicek,
she said that the increase is due to
the large freshman class size and
the increased interest in joining
sororities both at the University
and on college campuses across
the country.
LSA freshman Kellie Brouil-
lard just joined Delta Delta Delta
sorority. She said the recruitment
process was well organized and
allowed her to effectively decide
which house suited her best.
"We were all thrown into it
really fast, but I'm happy with
how Panhel put it together,"
Brouillard said. "The process is
long but, in the end I wouldn't
have wanted it to be done differ-
ently."
Brouillard said she decided
to join the Greek-letter commu-
nity because many of her family
members were involved in Greek
life. She also said she wanted to
broaden her social circle.
"I went into it to make more
friends," Brouillard said. "I
wanted to meet new people and
get really involved with philan-
thropy."
Joining the Greek community
makes Brouillard feel like she's

part of a large family, she said.
"It's only been two weeks and
these girls already feel like fam-
ily," she said. "I have friends that
didn't rush, and they do regret
not doing it because they see how
many friends I've made and how
much better I feel about myself."
Though formal recruitment
is over, IFC organizations are
encouraged to recruit throughout
the year, Vasicek said.
Nursing freshman Justin
Palka, a new member of Sigma
Phi Epsilon, said he was happy
with IFC's recruitment process.
"The process is solid," Palka
said. "You get to meet everyone
and see which fraternity is a bet-
ter fit for you."
Palka said he chose to join the
Greek community on campus to
make the large University feel
smaller since he came from a
small high school. He added that
his interest in community service
also influenced his decision to go
Greek since many fraternities on
campus have a focus on philan-
thropy.
"My big thing was community
outreach," he said. "I didn't want
to just go to a party fraternity."

that makes the Google Apps Sys-
tem "the best tool for students,
faculty and staff."
"There are lots of ways to allow
people to engage and interact in
real-time," Miskelly said. "We
allow you to share dynamic con-
tent, and we allow you to do all of
this in a very secure and private
manner."
According to Miskelly, 9 mil-
lion students and faculty at

said educational institutions like
the absence of advertising and
the option to use school-specific

Chris Walsh said the security fea-
tures in the program also make it
attractive to potential users.
"We have hundreds of thou-

said. "And then we put our own

what this means is that with these

how long or how short somebody's

"There is one human race. We are
the human race."
King continued by discuss-
ing the values that she considers
important as a pro-life advocate
and a civil rights activist.
"I believe that human love and
compassion will take us very far,"
she said. "Faith, hope, love, repen-
tance, forgiveness are all prin-
ciples that we all can embrace and
should embrace."
King stressed that she contin-
ues to support the pro-life move-
ment and to carry the message of
equality that her father and uncle
passed down to her.
"If Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
came to the event today," King
said, "he would encourage us all
to get together, to love and forgive
each other, and to work out a solu-

Internet."
Google utilizes security mea-
sures like an encryption process
that makes it impossible for any-
one to take user data from Google
and view it. Users can also log on
from a second computer to end a
session not terminated on a previ-
ously used computer.
At the event, the Google repre-
sentatives assured audience mem-
bers that user data belongs to the
user and that Google only scans
data to benefit the user experi-
ence. This is done through an
automated system, not through
human efforts, Walsh said.
The Google Products Suite also
includes features to make e-mail
more user-friendly like "Got the
Wrong Bob?" - which alerts users
when they may be sending an
e-mail to the wrong person - and
"Don't Forget Bob!" - which lets
users know if they are forgetting
an e-mail recipient who they fre-
quently e-mail.
University students who
attended the presentation said
they were fairly impressed by the
system and drew comparisons
between the features presented
by Google and those highlighted
at a similar event held last week
by Microsoft.

King is the director of the

America, an organization that
aims to enhance the lives of peo-

lectually and socially. She is also
a strong supporter of Students for

"Anytime chapters call me and
I can work them into my schedule,
I like to try and help," King said of
the organization.
Before her presentation, King
noted that she was not giving her
presentation in a church - as she
often does - and said she wel-
comed everyone regardless of per-
sonal opinions about abortion and
civil rights.
But agroup ofgraduate students
from the University's School of
Social Work attended King's pre-
sentation in an effort to respond
to controversial comments King
made recently about her position
on homosexuality.
Among the students, Alia Tor-
ran-Burrel, a first-year Social

attended last night's event and the
one sponsored by Microsoft, said
he liked Google's collaborative
features.
"Microsoft didn't really show
the collaboration," Mora said. "I
believe (Microsoft) can have more
than two people collaborate, but
they never went into that. I'm a
little skeptical (about Microsoft).
I think Google really outdid them-
selves."
LSA senior Jingran Wang said
he thought Google's system was
easier to navigate and had a better
layout design, but he considered
the competition a toss-up.
"It pretty much comes down
to implementation - how much
we can Michiganize both of their
offerings," Wang said.
Miskelly said Google made an
immense effort to customize its
product to cater to the University.
"We set out to come here and
really understand the experience
at Michigan, and we set out to
make our presentation as applica-
ble to that audience as possible,"
Miskelly said in an interview after
the presentation. "There are thou-
sands of universities, community
colleges and schools using our
products everyday, and we'd love
to add the University of Michigan
to that list."
Work graduate student, asked
King about her position on gay
rights.
King responded to Torran-
Burrel, saying she would have to
be invited back a second time in
order to address the topic fully,
but that in her mind every life is
important.
"What we're talking about
tonight is the right to live," King
said. "Everyone has the right to
be loved and cherished. I'm not
for hating people because of their
denomination or their size or their
sexual lives. That's wrong to do
that."
Despite the criticisms, LSA
senior Jeff Brown, who has been a
member of Students for Life since
his freshman year, said the orga-
nization was "very honored" by
King's attendance.
"Dr. King is a very well respect-
ed leader in the pro-life commu-
nity," Brown said. "Being in this
movement I've always found that
people who've had abortions and
regretted it make the best spokes-
people."

A line of our own
'U' must lead in embryonic stem cell research
Landmark progress was recently made in stem cell research
at the University. Last week, University researchers suc-
cessfully created the first human embryonic stem cell
line in the state. This achievement makes the University part of a
small group of institutions that have created stem cell lines. Stem
cell lines have the potential to help in the search for cures and
treatments for diseases and injuries. Along with saving lives, this
research could help the state's economy, so it's an important field
to expand. To further this important work, the University should
continue to lead in the field of embryonic stem cell research.

Responsible rivlaries

think it would be difficult to hype
up the football game this weekend
any more than what has already
been done. Michi-
gan State is ranked
#17 and Michi-
gan is #18. We're;
at home. Denard
Robinson has been -
wowing fans week
after week. Mark
Dantonio, who is
recovering from a -
heart attack and aC
blood clot, will be C T
coaching from the FLETCHER
press box. State
beat us in overtime
last year, and we're
looking for revenge. Not to mention
the most obvious thing - it's a huge
rivalry game.
I love rivalries. I grew up in Geor-
gia where it is UGA or die. I was able
to witness the chaos of the Georgia
vs. Georgia Tech games as well as
what they call the "largest outdoor
cocktail party," which is the Florida
vs. Georgia game. But let'sbe real, you
can't beat Michigan vs. Ohio State or
the in-state rivalry of Michigan vs.
Michigan State. The atmosphere, the
Michigan pride and the downright
hatred the opposing schools have for
each other is legendary. Not to men-
tion, it's a lot of fun.
Athletes revel in rivalry games.
Those are the games where you want
to play perfectly. Those are the games
where it's not okay just to win, but to
crush your opponent into oblivion.
But sometimes it goes too far.
Rivalries are analogous with emo-

tions, which are what make them
fun. But emotions can be a dangerous
thing. For example, let's say you're
out for lunch and there is someone at
a table next to you with an Ohio State
shirt on. Without even thinking, you
will probably give them a dirty look.
You don't know them, they haven't
said anything to you, but based on
emotion, you feel the need to express
your disdain by staring at them with a
look of complete disgust.
Or take for example a scenario thatI
witnessed just yesterday. It was a busy
night on State Street, and a car drove
by with a bunch of State fans in it.
Naturally, they felt the need to scream
"GO GREEN!" out of the car win-
dow, while many people on the street
immediately responded in an array of
expletives. Without a doubt, there will
be even more of this type of behavior
on Saturday between Michigan and
Michigan State fans.
Fans at games often turn from
funny to mean. Personally, I love crazy
fans. I've been called every name in
the book: Sasquatch, Mr. Ed, T-Rex,
Scarecrow and for some reason Yao
Ming in high school by fans of the
opposing team. I think it's hilarious
when fans come up with creative and
witty cheers to get the other team dis-
tracted. But there's a fine line between
witty and rude.
Just last week the volleyball team
traveled to Ohio State and the usual
creative cheers took a turn down the
inappropriate and hurtful route - one
Ohio State student actually wrote our
coach a letter of apology.
Emotions in rivalry games are just
as - if not more - dangerous for ath-

letes. As I mentioned above, there is a
different mindset when approaching
rivalry games: the need to play per-
fectly and the need to win big. This is
when athletes get in trouble.

University researchers began their work
on the stem cell line in March. According
to an Oct. 4 Daily article, the stem cell line
will be used for greater understanding of
human development. Donated embryos
have only been used since a 2008 ballot
proposal passed, making it legal for women
to donate embryos for stem cell research.
Despite progress, the research faces some
obstacles: The future of federal funding for
embryonic stem cell research is currently
uncertain after a U.S. District Court judge
banned the funding in August.
The life-saving potential of these devel-
opments is amazing. Using this line,
researchers have the potential to discover
cures for diseases like Huntington's and
Parkinson's, as well as many others. Stem
cells can also be used to help test new
pharmaceuticals that could better treat ill-
nesses, and to identify potentially harmful
side effects of new drugs. Curing debili-
tating diseases and making drugs safer
will have a broad positive impact. This
research needs to be further advanced to
make these goals a reality.
The University's leap forward in stem cell
research could also be good news for the
state. Progressive, cutting-edge research is
crucial to Michigan's economic improve-

ment. Exciting developments, like the cre-
ation of a human embryonic stem cell line,
will draw intelligent minds to the state and
the University, encouraging the growth of a
new industry to diversify the economy.
In spite of the clear benefits of this newly
developed stem cell line, federal fund-
ing for stem cell research is currently in
a state of limbo. Though the U.S. Court of
Appeals overruled the District Court's ban
in late October, the federal funding may be
ruled unconstitutional once the appeals
court makes its final decision. University
researchers are concerned that without
proper federal funding, they won't be able
to use the stem cell line to its full potential.
The U.S. Court of Appeals should immedi-
ately address this issue so researchers can
continue with their work unimpeded. To
prevent similar problems in the future, the
federal government should create legisla-
tion to protect funding.
University researchers' accomplishment
is an impressive step for the medical com-
munity and the state. To put this line to
proper use, federal funding must be pro-
tected. The University should continue to
advance its research in embryonic stem
cells to solidify its status as a leader in
medical research.

Insults can be
witty but shouldn't
become hurtful.
There is a certain flow, rhythm or as
many people call it, "the zone," when
athletes have their best games. There
aren't many thoughts going through
their minds, they make all the right
choices and they do what their team
needs. But when athletes try to do
too much or try to play too perfectly,
it never works. At big rivalry games,
there's too much excitement, too much
brain chatter, too many distractions *
and too much concern about the out-
come. That's when you see mistakes.
We have to remember that at the
end of the season, the team's record
is simply wins and losses. There is
no extra win given for beating Ohio
State or Michigan State. Those wins
may be more exciting, but they are
not more important. So with any
rivalrygame at the University, let'sbe
witty but not disrespectful, have fun
but not be petty and after we've won
we can relish in the celebration.

The many shades offandom

Public must leavejudgment
of Shirvell to court system
TO THE DAILY:
We, along with the rest of this campus,
have been shocked and disturbed by Michigan
assistant attorney general Andrew Shirvell's
repugnant anti-gay statements and signs. Dis-
crimination against the LGBT community or
any community must always be taken seriously.
We, as a University community, must respond
appropriately and with great thought.
The First Amendment intentionally and
necessarily defends Shirvell's offensive and
appalling speech. Our Constitution gives a
citizen the right to be a bigot and to freely
express his bigotry. When this inflammatory
speech becomes a direct threat and infringes
on an individual's right to live free from threat
of harm, the police and the courts must step
in to protect the attacked individual. The Uni-
versity's chapter of the American Civil Liber-
ties Union supports the court's role in deciding
this extremely important but non-distinct line
between free speech and a true threat.

The ACLU-UM Undergraduate Chapter
stands strong in our support and admiration
of Michigan Student Assembly President Chris
Armstrong's continued leadership in enact-
ing an open housing policy in the face of these
despicable attacks. This policy remains impor-
tant in working to end discrimination against
transgender students on this campus.
The ACLU believes that the best way to
combat hateful speech is more speech, not cen-
sorship or government retaliation. Michigan
Attorney General Mike Cox is right to distance
himself and his office from Shirvell's personal
speech. But it's important that before Cox acts
to discipline Shirvell and before we try Shirvell
in the court of public opinion, we allow the
legal court to decide if Shirvell's speech and
conduct has crossed the line into harassment,
stalking or some sort of true threat. Instead,
.we must work harder than ever to protect the
rights of the LGBT community and continue
our advocacy for policies like open housingthat
demand these rights.

hile most pre-gaming
activities are restricted
to rounds of beer pong,
flip-cup, or "Star
Wars" drinking
games (for engi-
neering majors),
there is one game
often ignored by =
the masses on-
football Saturdays: F
Mullet Math. The
rules are simple
enough - take a MELANIE
drink every time
you see a Michigan KRUVELIS
fan rocking a hair-_
style a la Billy Ray
Cyrus. And if your
motive is to get as drunk as possible,
I assure you, the number will get so
high that you won't remember how
many times Denard flashes the Heis-
man pose Saturday afternoon.
The variances in the breeds of
Michigan fans seem a little strange.
After all, as anyone wait-listed by
an Ivy League school will remind
you, the University is one of the best
schools in the country - perhaps in
the world. We are, of course, a com-
munity created by the leaders and
the best. We stand at the forefront of
scientific exploration, justice, intel-
lect and reason. Such a world-class
institution should have world-class
fans, right?
Maybe not. The walk (or for some,
the stumble) to the Big House is, to put
it delicately, perhaps one of the largest
freak shows in all of sports. The jour-
ney from State Street to East Stadium
Boulevard isn't simply filled with stu-
dents looking for a break from biology
class, alumni looking to reminisce or
red plastic cups. It's a stage for fanat-
ics from all walks of life to show their
true colors, which are, conveniently

enough, maize and blue.
Take, for instance, the "Walmart
Wolverine," as coined by a Pure Michi-
gan spoof video. This thirty-something
fan, representing his pride in a pleather
letterman jacket from the now-bank-
rupt Steve and, Barry's chain, spends
those chilly October mornings alter-
nating between slurring "Hail to the
Victors" and grilling outside the Big
House. Never an alum but always afan,
he's eager to curse any one who even
utters the name "Dantonio."
Head toward the intersection of
State and Howard and you're bound
to find the next breed of fan, the "Van
Wilder," conveniently located out-
side a frat house. A semi-recent-ish
graduate, this Wolverine zealot (col-
loquially known as "the creepy old
dude") currently passes time doing
keg stands with strangers or shout-
ing that he really doesn't need to look
for a job - he can just "hang here
with these cool girls!" Excitement in
responses is usually not reciprocated,
but the general uneasiness fades once
he begins a "Go Blue" chant.
And of course, there's always the
freshman. Marked by the spotless
2010 football season shirt, this little
guppy of the University food chain
generally has two options for game
day festivities: stick to hanging with
kids from high school or attempt to
make it big by becoming the notori-
ous "Freshman Drinker." In either
case, the young freshman is charac-
terized by a general look of discom-
fort, uncertainty and an inability to
hold one's liquor.
At any rate, fans from the strange
to the squares come together for that
slow-moving saunter to the Big House.
And while it may seem that a walk to a
stadium is nothing more than a time
killer, this proud parade of screaming
yellow is, in some respects, the high-

light of the very occasion.
It's next to impossible to feel dis-
jointed from the maize frenzy (unless,
of course, you're wearing green). Sud-
denly that old guy at the frat house
isn't so obnoxious, the freshman isn't
so awkward and the guy in yellow and
blue overalls isn't so rowdy. For the
next fifteen minutes of your life, these
complete strangers are your surrogate
family members, your temporary best
friends. You may never see them again
once lost in the seaof over one hundred
thousand, but for now, it's not really
important where anyone is from, when
they graduated or if they did, for that
matter. As long as the scathing hatred
for Ohio State is shared, the camarade-
rie will hold strong.
The three people
you meet on
football Saturday.
So on Saturday, when the Wolver-
ines take on the Spartans, don't fret
over how ridiculous you look in the
face paint your friend insisted you
wear. Don't worry aboutthe beer that
someone spilled on you. And don't
freak out about how crazy the guy
in the blue and yellow wig seems to
be. By 3:15 p.m. that afternoon, you'll
be walking side by side in one of the
greatest displays of school pride
known to man. And if you're still a
little embarrassed, don't worry: by
Sunday morning, no one will remem-
ber it anyways.

DUELING
COLUMNS,
In the week leading up to the Michigan-Michigan State football
game each year,football writers from the Daily and the student
newspaper at Michigan State exchange columns. As both 5-0
teams prepare to clash in Ann Arbor, here's this year's installment:

The Michigan Daily's Ryan Kartje:

The State News's Jeremy Warnemuende:

y sister was never one for
common sense. We've
been telling her this for
years.
Despite this, she had always told me
she wanted to follow in my footsteps
and go to one of the finest schools,
athletically and
academically,
in the country.
A place where
couches remain.
untorched and
blondes remain
unbleached. I held
out hope for her.
So you can RYAN
imagine my KARTJE
disappointment
when she decided
to go back on that promise, give up
any remaining common sense or job
prospects, and apply to Michigan
State.
But there's still time to save her.
There's still time to consider other
paths of education. Trade school,
perhaps? A healthy apprenticeship
with the local garbage man, maybe?
Either would lead to a more respect-
able job, post-graduation.
So I leave this to you sis, my last
plea to get you back to your senses
and to keep you where you belong:
Ann Arbor. Remember, you're
already my little sister, you don't
need to be my little brother too.
Dear little sister,
You know I care about you. That's
why I'm doing this. But just so you
get a picture of what life would be
like in East Lansing, let me describe
how that first year would go.
First off, chances are you'll end up
in one of Michigan State's fine dor-
mitory establishments - just a hop,
skip, a jump and a 30-minute walk
from everything else on campus.
Once you get settled in that night,
make sure you take a trip down East

Grand River to stop in at Gumby's for
its famous late-nightpizza - a place
where Michigan State students crave
"pokey stix" because garlic knots are
too complicated.
I know you gethomesick, but don't
worry: they do all they can to make
you feel welcome in that first week.
Maybe you'll play some icebreak-
ers with your R.A. and your hall. Or
maybe, you guys could go out and get
ice cream. Maybe the football team
will even take time out of their night
and bring in the welcome wagon like
they did for the new kids at Rather
Hall last year by wearing ski masks
and beatingthe tar outof you and
your freshman friends.
Once you make it to the weekend,
that first Saturday should be some-
thing you never forget: your first
gameday asa college student. Now, I
know you've only been to gamedays
in Ann Arbor, soI made you a list of
ways to fit in when you make your
way into Spartan Stadium:
1. Don't show your disappoint-
ment when you realize the stadium
has almost 40,000 fewer seats than
you're used to. I hear the upper level
really isn't that bad, especially with
binoculars.
2. I know you love to sing, so make
sure to read up onthe Michigan State
fight song. Once you getoverthe fact
that it has nine more lines to remem-
ber than the gold standard at Michi-
gan and that most of the lyrics don't
rhyme, it shouldn't be too hard.
3. If you ever starttalking football
with another student, remember
your facts: State has won six Big Ten
titles, just one fewer than the Univer-
sity of Chicago (which left the con-
ference and Division Iin 1946). You
have zero Heisman Trophy winners
and a grand total of two Pro Football
Hall of Famers to Michigan's three
and eight, respectively. And the
greatest triumph in the history of
State football was delivered by Appa-

lachian State in 2007. That lastone's
important, make sure to harp on it as
much as possible.
4. Lastly, make sure you ignore the
fact thatcyou've seen probably half the
offense on either an episode of Date-
line or re-runs of The Longest Yard.
Remember, Sparty deserves second,
third and fourth chances, too.
If this sounds at all appealing,
then Iguess I can't do anythingto
stop you. You being a little sibling,
I understand that you would do
anything in your power to step out
of your successful older brother's
shadow. And maybe you would enjoy
events like "Tie your shoes like Kirk
Cousins" Day, where everyone pre-
tends they don't know how cool it
is that Denard Robinson runs with
untied shoes.
And would you look at that? I
spent a whole 700 words without
even discussing the greatest player in
college football - a Wolverine who
will probably run for a touchdown
before the Michigan State band
makes it through the fight song once
on Saturday.
I know, I know, what if Denard
gets hurt? Michigan State will, after
all, focus their entire gameplan on
stopping him and only him. But I
worry less about Denard and more
aboutthe Spartan linebackers, who
probably can'tpronounce half the
words used to hyperbolize Michi-
gan's quarterback.
So think it over on Saturday after
Michigan, with next-to-no second-
ary, an injured running back and a
seemingly absent defensive coordina-
tor still beats Michigan State with
one player and a pair of untied shoes.
Then, let me know.
Signed,
Your BigBrother

I know it's tough for
you self-righteous and even more
self-conscious Michigan faithful
to confess to any sign of inferior-

ing since JEREMY
the last WARNEMUENDE
time the -
Wolverines
have topped the Spartans - in
football or men's basketball
- and it's official your time as
self-proclaimed big brother has
run out.
I remember standing in the
Michigan student section in
2008, singing the "Michigan
State Fight Song" with the thou-
sands of other MSU students and
fans who invaded your sacred
hole in the ground to watch
a 35-21 Spartans' win. I also
remember whenever the eyesores
known as U-M students made
their incredibly predictable and
dim-witted attempts to mock my
education, it easily was overpow-
ered by chants of, "Go Green. Go
White."
The high concentration of
green and white in the crowd
that day was no coincidence.
MSU fans proudly packed
into the Big House for a reason,
knowing the game was going to
be the beginning of a new era.
So far, so good.
The two straight wins speak
for themselves, but the actions
off the field can be telling as well.

Big-time recruits now are
flocking to East Lansing, while
players already committed to
U-M are running away from Rich
Rodriguez like little kids fleeing
from a strange man handing out
candy in his big, white van.
All of your fans, Wolverines
or otherwise, also have indicated
how the rivalry has changed. It
eats you up inside to know MSU
is taking ownership of the annual
matchup.
You claim this hardly is a
rivalry and the game means
nothing. MSU is just another
team on the schedule.
That must be why you're buy-
ing up T-shirts that read, "The
Big Game at the Big House,"
and hypingtomorrow's game
like your season depends on the
result.
You're lying if you say it
doesn'tbother you that two years
after the lastgame at the Big
House, the Paul Bunyan Trophy
remains in East Lansing.
Sorry to break it to you, but he
has no intentions of leaving.
You tried to snatch him away
last year.
Quarterback Tate Forcier, then
the Heisman front-runner and
only known hobbit in the U.S.,
led the undefeated Wolverines
into Spartan Stadium.
The little guy kept it close for
a while, even managing to force
overtime. In the end, though, it
was kind of like when you play
basketball against your little
brother and you let him hang
around for a little while before -
well, you getthe point.
Michigan once again brings an
undefeated record into this year's
game and has a new Heisman .
favorite lining up behind center.
Perfect.
The only thing better than

beating a Wolverine when he's
down is knocking him off his
high horse - a position you all
love whether it's deserved or not.
So when Denard Robinson -
built more for the WNBA than
college football - takes the field
against MSU, don't expect any
of the Spartans to be worried.
Instead, real Big Ten footballplay-
ers, such as senior linebacker Greg
Jones, who hasn't had a chanceto
hit someone Robinson's size since
his freshman year of high school,
will be salivating at the opportu-
nity in front of him.
Everyone is talking about
what Robinson has done to the
likes of Indiana and Notre Dame
- teams with defenses so good
they've almost cracked the top 85
in the country.
But much like last season, the
hype won't matter.
And like two years ago, neither
will any home-field advantage.
Not after the additions to the Big
House did nothing more than
create extra room for green-and-
white-clad fans to embarrass the
U-M crowd, sitting on its hands
as MSU destroys a defense even
Robinson would feel bad for
abusing.
Looking at what I've said and
thinking about it more, I know
nothing I can say will help you
acceptthe fact the Spartans are
taking over a rivalry you care
about more than you'll ever
admit. As the most delusional fan
base in the country, you just don't
have it in you.
However, maybe, after MSU
extends the winning streak to
1,070 days tomorrow, you'll start
to get the point.

with critical praise. The Walkmen
For a lot of bands these

that elusive breakout The Magic Stick
recorddoesn'thituntil Ticketsfrom$12
well after the first or
second try, giving art-
ists time - for better or worse - to tinker
with and perfect their sound before larger
audiences start tuning in.
The New York vets have come close to a
breakout a few times, most recently with
2008's critically lauded You a Me on the
back of its single "In the New Year."
But the band is still a little stunned it hit
the jackpot on the sixth try.
"We were incredibly surprised," organ-
ist Peter Bauer said in an interview with
the Daily. "I don't think we've ever had a
record received this well."
The band has been putting out records
steadily since 2002, back when all things
in the rockun'roll tent revolved around
garage-rock acts like The Strokes, leaving

room for little else. But nowadays, when
more slow-burning bands like The Nation-
al can generate a #2 record, it's not sur-
prising that their New York counterparts
aren't far behind.
"I think, in general, the music that's
semi-popular right now is a lot better than
it was like four years ago - that a band
like Animal Collective could get so big
nowadays is great," Bauer said. "In 2003
or 2004, it seemed like four-on-the-floor
rock was the popular thing, it was almost
like anything else was annoying to peo-
ple."
This time around, people seem to be
catching on. After an enthusiastic recep-
tion of their fittingly rainy set at this
summer's Lollapalooza, the band seemed
poised. They even made the trek to Eng-
land last May for the Pavement-curated
All Tomorrow's Parties festival - with a
mid-set shout out from Stephen Malkmus,
no less.
"I don't know what happened, but they
dissed us in 'Range Life,' " Bauer said.
"They put'The Walkmen' in there after we
played the first night." (The original lyrics
target the Smashing Pumpkins, resulting
in a lot of huffing and puffing from vocalist
and guitarist Billy Corgan when the track
was first released.)
"You know, they ask us to play this thing
and then they diss us like two nights later,"
Bauer laughed. "I'm dying to figure out
what happened!"
For Lisbon, the band actually spent time

in the Portuguese capital - a whole three-
days - and found enough inspiration
there to create the record's damp mood as
well as its namesake.
"There was something in the quality of
the city that reflected the music we were
making, so we named the record after it,"
Bauer explained.
Tracks like "Angela Surf City" and
"Victory" contrast Hamilton Leithauser's
scorched vocals with layers of rain-dam-
aged guitars - all delivered with just the
right amount of gloomy, room-generated
reverb to keep everything foggy.
"The whole time we were there it was
raining. When we were standing on the
beach and it was raining it kind of seemed
similar to what we were doing," Bauer
said. "I was trying to explain it to this guy
in Portugal: It's like guys in pants on the
beach, you know? That sort of sounds like
our music."
In making the new record, the band
enlisted producers John Congleton (Mod-
est Mouse, Okkervil River) and Chris Zane
(Passion Pit, Tokyo Police Club), both alt-
rock veterans whose old-school ethic and
ear for vintage sounds seemed tailored to
The Walkmen's new material.
"John's really into these old Soviet
microphones," Bauer smirked. "They look
like the Soviet equivalent of what you're
used to."
Despite its cohesive final mix, the record
went through a number of different phases

The Mariinsky Orchestra is big - big
sound, big talent, big names, big home-
land.
Since the time of Peter the Great, the
Orchestra of the Mariinsky Theater has
been an artistic treasure and a source of
national pride for Rus-
sia. Having survived The
200 years in a nation of
political upheaval and
instability, the Mariinsky Orchestra

thanks to its most recent4

Maestro Valery Gergiev. Tikes fom$10
This Sunday, Ann Arbor
audiences will witness this powerhouse
of an orchestra in a concert at Hill Audi-
torium.
Gergiev and his orchestra have toured
the globe extensively, resulting ina recent
resurgence of interest in Russian music.
Gergiev and the Mariinsky Orchestra have
made 10 UMS appearances, most notably
their five-concert cycle of 11 Shostakovich
symphonies in 2006.
For the first half of Sunday's program,
the Mariinsky will perform the luscious
and passionate Piano Concerto No. 3 of
Sergei Rachmaninoff.
With its full chords and dazzling solo
cadenzas, the concerto is regarded as
one of the most difficult and technically
demanding works for piano. However,
in the hands of a skilled pianist, Rach-
maninoff's Third can be a moving experi-
ence.
The Mariinsky may have found just
such a pianist in soloist Denis Matsuev,
who will join the orchestra for Rach-
maninoff's Third at the Hill concert. The
winner of the 1998 International Tchai-
kovsky Competition, Matsuev has been
compared to legendary Russian pianist
Vladimir Horowitz by The London Times.
The second half of the Mariinsky's
program is devoted to Gustav Mahler's
Symphony No. 5. As the 2011 centennial
anniversary of Mahler's death approach-
es, orchestras have been honoring the
composer in their season repertoire. For
Ann Arbor audiences, the Mariinsky's
performance will be a unique live sym-
phonic experience.
"There's something really exciting
about listening to Mahler's music live,"
said Residential College associate profes-

sor Naomi Andre, who teaches a seminar
on the history of the symphony. "It's really
hard to get that same sense when you're
listening to your CDs or your iPod. And all
music, I believe, is wonderful when you
get to experience it live. But there's some-
thing ... wonderful with Mahler."
Composed between 1901 and 1902 (the
same, decade as Rachmaninoff's Piano
Concerto No. 3), Mahler's Fifth Symphony
is a massive orchestral work in five move-
ments. The piece is primarily known for
its romantic fourth movement, the Ada-
gietto, which was dedicated to his wife,
Alma Mahler-Werfel.
"It was literally a love letter he wrote to
Alma," Andre said. "It's just a wonderful
moment to take a deep breath and be pen-
sive ... It's just so lush and so sensuous and
beautiful."
Along with his eight other symphonies,
the Fifth marks an important point in a
symphonic history that began with Franz
Joseph Haydn in the18th century.
"In terms of the well known sympho-
nies - what's become canonic - Mahler
represents the end of the Germanic tradi-
tion that had dominated the symphony,"
Andre said. "It's interesting to be a hun-
dred years from that and looking back."
For listeners new to Mahler, it can be
difficult to adapt to his often slow and
Celebrating Mahler
and Rachmaninoff.
expansive compositional style. In fact,
Mahler is famous for his comment to fel-
low composer Jean Sibelius, "A symphony
should be like the world. It must embrace
everything."
Andr6 pointed out that when listening
to Mahler, "you really have to slow your
pulse down" to enjoy the composer's rich
and complex orchestration. She went on to
assert that Mahler's music has a univer-
sal appeal because of its "all-embracing"
nature.
"This is where it all comes together -
life, and thought, and who we are, and
falling in love, and (our place) in the world
and in nature - all of this comes together
in Mahler's symphonies."
The works of Mahler and Rachmaninoff
will come alive through the Mariinsky
under Gergiev this Sunday at Hill Audito-
rium at 4 p.m.

. Stars align at Magic Stick

Detroit showcases
some of Canada's
best pop fare
By DAVID RIVA
Daily Arts Writer
When blogs and webzines bom-
bard curious listeners with an
endless supply
of buzzbands Stars
and one-trick
ponies, finding Tomor'ow
new music in the at8 p.m.
Internet Age can The Magic Stick
be a daunting $15
and exhausting
task. The emphasis on the here-
and-now makes it easy to forget
about bands that have gradually
progressed over the years into a
talented collection of musicians.
But during a time when steady
growth is a lost art, Stars has
proven that just because it doesn't
appear on a "Best New Music" or
"Heavy Rotation" list doesn't mean
they're not worth your time and
attention.
Now in its 10th year as a band,
Stars will showcase its extensive
catalogue - five full-length studio
albums and five EPs - on Saturday
night at The Magic Stick.
The Toronto natives are part of
a Canadian indie-rock insurgence
along with the likes of Broken
Social Scene, The New Pornogra-
phers and Wolf Parade that seem-
ingly sparked out of thin air.
Bassist Evan Cranley claims
the explosion of high-quality tal-
ent coming out of the Great White
North is no coincidence. His
explanation of the phenomenon is
two-fold.
"We get a lot of government
grants to help us make music and
endowments through the govern-
ment that help fund artists in Can-
ada," Cranley said.
Although policymakers have
made their country conducive to
creativity, the nation's massive
geographical landmass and the
desire for connectivity among
citizens have also contributed to
the conception of many musical
collectives.
"The fact that we're such a
huge country with a small amount
of people, you need community
around you to kind of feel a safe-
ness and a home," he explained.
Stars's one-two punch of co-
leadsingers (Torquil Campbell

on JF*C series

and Amy Millan) is consistently
its most dynamic facet. The two
play off one another's strengths
and weaknesses - both vocally
and emotionally - creating an
intimate and sometimes vulner-
able relationship that has been
essential to the band's success and
identity.
Campbell and Millan usually
divide the songs on a Stars record
into an even 50-50 split. Accord-
ing to Cranely, sharing the vocal
workload isa conscious decision.
"The strength of the band is
having two vocalists, so we think
the more that's kind of equalized
between the two in the record,
then the more it represents us," he
said.
Although Cranely isn't part of
this unique vocal relationship, he
does play an essential role as one
of two primary songwriters for
the band.
For Stars's latest record The
Five Ghosts, Cranley noted some
of the main musical differences
from previous records.
"Instrumentally was the big-
gest change," he said. "It was alot
less ornamental."
"It was a big thing for us to try
to really push the synthesis and
the drums and the keyboards and
stuff, because the lyrical content
in this record, we thought it was

really kind of cold (and) stark,"
he continued. "We just really
wanted to try to talk about these
really stark kind of emotions and
we wanted to have that really
balanced with, you know, stark
instrumentals."
The emotional content felt
throughout Ghosts's 11 songs was a
result of recent events in the mem-
bers' lives.
"We lost some people that were
very close to us and we also had
babies and started homes, and for
us, those were themes we wanted
to talk about on the record," he
said. "We want to come with per-
sonal themes because we want to
encapsulate this kind of diary of
what we've been doing the last
year and a half."
These personal themes - consis-
tent throughout Stars's catalogue
- have caught the attention of a
wide variety of people who aren't
confined to a specific style or scene.
Cranley describes Stars's fan-
base as "the people that were first
into us 11 years ago, if you could
take those same 200 people ... and
multiply them by 10," then you
would have an audience at a Stars
show today.
"It's kind of an interesting
demographic," he explained. "We
don't have people that dress a cer-
tain way that like us or (are) into

one kind of music that like us."
"These are kind of everyday
people that like us. The characters
in our songs are very kind of day-
to-day, everyday people. And our
fans are kind of the same people in
these stories we talk about."
And Stars dedicate a consider-
able amount of time preparing a
live show to entertain fans.
"When you're putting together
a show, you really have to be con-
scious of telling a story in 90 min-
utes between the first song to the
last song," he said. "When we put
the show together ... we want to be
as dramatic and textural as pos-
sible to the audience."
"It's one thing to scribble a
setlist on a piece of paper and try
to write it, but it's another to try to
create a piece of theater out of it,
and that's what we try to do when
we put together shows."
Although the steady growth of a
band is not ideal for the rock'n'roll
lifestyle of most musicians, the
members of Stars seem to be satis-
fied with their place in the music
world. Speaking on the band's
longevity, Cranely cited patience,
trust, work ethic, love and forgive-
ness as key elements to the band's
long-term stability, the fruits of
which can be heard on The Five
Ghosts as well as tomorrow night
at The Magic Stick.

By BRIANNE JOHNSON
Daily Arts Writer
Rome might not have been built
in a day, but14 days were more than
enough for Todd Margaret to flip
all of Eng-
land on its
arse. Rack-

weapons,
blackmail
and possession of child pornog-
raphy with the intent to distrib-
ute," Margaret unleashes terror
on his new home without wasting
one awkward moment. Such an
accomplishment may inspire awe
in some, but somehow IFC's "The
Increasingly Poor Decisions of
Todd Margaret" goes from poor
to pathetic, making the show com-
pletelyunsalvageable.
Shipped to England on false
faith, Todd Margaret (David Cross,
"Arrested Development") eagerly
abandons his only companion,
his cat, to head a new company in
hopes of overcoming his timidness.
As a representative of Thunder
Muscle Energy Drinks, Margaret
builds his new life from a pile of
spontaneously bizarre lies. Hired
for assumed bravado, Margaret's
luck quickly expires (as does the
toxic drink he mercilessly forces
upon British natives). His hand
is scalded, the government blows
up his luggage and his plans are
manipulated by an ill-deceived
assistant. Yet Margaret continues
towillinglydesertrealityforafalse
sense of success.
The show is as realistic as Mar-
garet's wildly spun lies, and the
result is a total crackpot of des-
perate lines and far-fetched plots.
It's debatable what's more strange
- Cross's attempts to enliven a
hopeless character through insane
table-hopping rants (insisting that
he will "fuck the old out of you")
or the fact that anyone, fictional
or otherwise, could believe such
crap. From a dead company's offer
of a $120,000 starting salary to the

quaint cafd waitress with a passion
for molecular gastrology, "Marga-
ret" is worse with each minute.
The fabrications seem to force
themselves from a fathomless pit
of ignorance and desperation as
Margaret suffers no other reper-
cussion beyond constant humili-
ation. The character is a walking
mass of insanity, with opportuni-
ties only presented by means of
the furthered delusion of others.
It's obvious by the show's title that
Margaret will not develop as a
character, for the first minute pres-
ents his future call to court. Oblivi-
ously self-indulgent, "Margaret"
refuses to deliver a likable front-
man, despite Cross's best attempts.
But at least we can pity Mar-
garet, even with his unappealing
nature - something that can't be
said for the supporting cast. Dave
(Russell Tovey, "Being Human"),
Margaret's newly appointed and
admittedly unqualified assistant
is sarcastic and apathetic. As a
U.K. native, Dave isn't fooled by
his boss's lies and therefore takes
advantage of Margaret's fouls and
fuels the bizarre behavior. The real
charmer is Margaret's unscrupu-
lous boss (Will Arnett, "Arrested
Development"), a huffing and puff-
ing egotistical businessman whose
gravelly intonation reflects one
too many cigars. Arnett tries for
quirky, macho madness, but fails
without a clever script. Through-
Watching this is
a'poordecision.
out the episode, it's apparent that
each joke aims more for shock
value than laughs. The whole cast
is at a disadvantage as "Margaret"
substitutes actual wit with inces-
sant and over-indulgent swearing.
As the premiere episode ends,
Margaret sulks on the floor of his
apartment, exhaustedly pissing
his pants while his cat lies dead
at home. The show will be lucky
to escape the same fate. Allowing
the pathetic and unlikeable "The
Increasingly Bad Decisions of Todd
Margaret" to continue its plight
may be the poorest decision of all.

From Page 6A
before it reached its plaintive,
"dark art-rock" sound. In Lisbon's
early stages, the band drew as
much from the brassy bombast
dotting its last record as it did
from the one-two scuffle of coun-
try songwriters like Johnny Cash.
"'Blue As Your Blood' actually
started as a country song," Bauer
said. "We were playing a lot of
minor chords instead of major
chords, and with a country beat."
With all ofLisbon's (not to men-
tion The Walkmen's) modesty,
you'd be forgiven for not expecting
the five Washington, D.C. trans-
plants to pack much of a punch in
concert. But make no mistake: the
band has a reputation for being
one of the louder groups out there,
drawing comparisons to the deaf-
ening performances of acts like
psych-rockers Spacemen 3.
"For years, the only thing we
would do was try and be as loud
as possible," he said, before inter-
rupting himself mid-sentence.
"And now my wife is shh-ing me
because I'mtalkingso loud. Imust

The Walkmen perform at the
Magic Stick on Sunday. Doors
open at 8p.m. Tickets from $12.

All-American Michigan State linebacker Greg Jones could pose the biggest challenge to
quarterback phenom Denard Robinson and the Wolverines in the Big House on Saturday.

The Michigan Daily: This might be the year of the running back
in the Big Ten with all of the guys coming back, as a linebacker do
you like that?
Greg Jones: I like that alot. Ilike it alot more than spreadingus
out and basically playing basketball on the football field. I think
when it comes down to putting the ball in the running back's
hands and going heads up, that's how football should be played.
The Big Ten model, I think it's hard-nosed. Linebackers, not just
at Michigan State, like that because it's kind of hard because
we're so used to playing the run and you spread us out and you
have to defend the pass more than you're used to. Linebackers
like to come down and make hits in the run. In the spread, we
like to go at the quarterbacks too.
TMD: You were the Big Ten's Defensive Player of the Year last sea-
son and you decided to come back. Why?
GJ: It was a true family decision. I wrote out all of the pros and
cons. Me getting a degree was at the top of the list. It's about
where I want to be at 10 years from now. The NFL stands for
"Not For Long." And I felt like that if I get hurt, at least I have
my degree. I wanted to come back for my teammates. Leaving
6-7 was not good enough. It left a really bad taste in my mouth
and my teammates mouth. So that was a lot of my motivation
to come back.

TMD: You seniors have a chance to be 3-1 against Michigan, how
special would that be for you guys?
GJ: It would be really, really special, especially for the Mich-
igan guys, because I'm from Ohio. I don't have to see those
guys when I go home. I remember one guy we had lastyear, his
brother was on (Michigan). It's hard. They've got to see those
guys all the time.
TMD:Since Mike Hart called Michigan State, "LittleBrother,"you
Spartans have been undefeated. Talk about that streak.
GJ: That 2-0 thing, that's just us taking the right mindset
to want to win. To want to be great. Especially in the state of
Michigan, we really wantto turn the tide green, so I think we're
doing the right thing. Guys are coming into the season work-
ing hard and appreciating it. And for a lot of guys, the Michigan
game is a big game. But at the same time, we take it one game at
a time. We know thatgame's coming up without a doubt. And by
the time we play that game, just let loose.
TMD: Disruption is a word that comes up with impact defensive
players, what does that mean to you?
GJ: Disruption a lot of times means stripping the quarterback,
getting in his face and making it really hard on him. When
we approach every game, we say you want to get in the quar-
terback's face, disrupt his passes, get to him. Because a lot of
times, with a quarterback that is not really on kilter, it affects
the whole team. And that what the goal of all time is: to affect
the offense and try to get to the player with the ball.
TMD:Is that the greatest feeling, knowing when you're about to
beat an offensive lineman and get to the quarterback?
GJ: A lot of times it's after the play. The guy gets up and you
can tell he's ready to go again. But if a guy gets up and he
seems like he doesn't really want to get back up again, he
doesn't want to be in the game anymore, you can kinda tell.
He's in that mindset, 'I just want this to be over with, soI can
go home.' I think that's when it starts to set in my mind, that
it's time to put the pressure on and make sure he goes home. I
think that's what we try and do on defense ... It's a great feel-
ing. Especially, for everybody, not just for me. We're working
hard and on the sidelines, we're saying to each other, 'These
guys want to go home.' And we want to do our best to make
sure they do.
TMD: Do you thrive is hostile environments when Michigan State
goes on the road, like the Big House?
GJ: Definitely, I feel that's something you play for. That's some-
thing, as a recruit, you look for every time. You want to play at
your best (in the Big House). Especially, some of our guys from
Michigan, it means so much more to them. That's what they
dream about, being in the rivalry, their individual rivalry, in
their own state.

Michigan flew through its non-conference season, and the Wol-
verines survived a thriller at Indiana last weekend. But now the
real tests begin. Michigan's suspect defense will have its hands
full and we'll get to see how Denard Robinson handles good
defenses.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
3 GAME PREVIEW: This game might be the
biggest of Rich Rodriguez's three-year stint.
KICK AWAY: Troy Clack, a student, was close
to kicking in the Big House. Michigan's kickers,
on the other hand, are in the doghouse.
BREAKDOWN: The Spartans will have to try to
keep up with Denard Robinson to have a shot.
BEHIND ENEMY LINES: Tim Rohan caught up
with Spartan linebacker Greg Jones at Big Ten
Media day in August. See what Jones had to say.

2010 Schedule

Connecticut (Sept. 4): Denard ran all over
UConn. He proved he could pass the ball too,
and Rich Rod's hot seat began to cool down.
Notre Dame (Sept. 11): After UConn, the ND
game was Denard's encore on steroids, with a
game-winning drive.

Iowa (Oct. 16): Iowa's Adrian Clayborn may be
the Big Ten's closest replacement for BG. That's
a problem only if he can catch Shoelace.
Penn State (Oct. 30): PSU has a freshman QB.
Michigan knows what that's like. 'Nuff said.

Massachusetts (Sept. 18): Michigan squeaked Illinois (Nov. 6): Ron Zook is probably the only
by the Minutemen last weekend, winning by less IL N/IS coach in the nation who makes RichRod feel like
than a touchdown. A win is a win is a win. his job is secure.

Bowling Green (Sept. 25): Michigan's defense
was thrown into question vs. Massachusetts. It
will have a lot to prove aginst the Falcons.
Indiana (Oct. 2): The Wolverines survived their
first Big Ten test - but defense was once again
suspect. Denard saved the day with 494 yards.
Michigan State (Oct. 9): A top-20 showdown.
and Dantonio's return to football - as if Mich-
igan-Michigan State needed any more intrigue.

Purdue (Nov. 13): Danny Hope did something
last season RichRod would kill for: beat OSU. But
they've had a rough year thus far. Yikes.
Wisconsin (Nov. 20): The Badgers basically
return their entire team. But hey, their last visit
to the Big House went pretty well for Michigan.
Ohio State (Nov. 27): Who knows, maybe
Terrelle Pryor and OSU will have to try and derail
Michigan's title hopes.

By NICOLE AUERBACH
Daily Sports Writer
It's already a can't miss, circle-
your-calendar game for most people
in the state of Michigan.
Add a coach returning from a heart
attack, a Heisman front-runner and
two unblemished records, and "can't
miss" suddenly becomes an under-
statement.
The 2010 installment of the Michi-
gan-Michigan State game, which will
take place in Ann Arbor on Saturday,
features storylines that are among the
most intriguing in college football.
Spartan coach Mark Dantonio
suffered a heart attack following
Michigan State's overtime win over
Notre Dame on Sept. 19. He planned
to coach the Spartans last week
against Wisconsin from the press
box, but a blood clot in his leg kept
him sent him back to the hospital.
The fourth-year coach says nothing
will keep him from coaching from
the press box at the Big House on

Saturday, though.
"You can't keep me down Michi-
gan week," Dantonio said to begin
his weekly news conference on
Tuesday. "It's good to be back -
again."
He'll be welcomed back to the
field with the biggest challenge in
the Big Ten - containing Michigan's
explosive sophomore quarterback
Denard Robinson.
According to the nation's top col-
lege football analysts, Robinson is
the favorite to run away with the
Heisman Trophy. In five games, he's
already accumulated 1,008 passing
yards, and he leads the nation with
905 rushing yards.
"Denard is an outstanding play-
er," Dantonio said. "When you look
at the film, (Indiana) had the right
defense and he makes people miss.
"We have to swarm and get a lot
of people to the point of attack. The
one thing about playing them is if he
makes a guy miss, he has the ability
to go the distance."
Robinson is a huge - if not the -
reason the Wolverines are 5-0 and
just a win away from bowl eligibility.
On the other side of the field, the key
to the Spartans' 5-0 start hasn't been
just one player. It's been their run
game in general, perhaps most nota-
bly the emergence of running back

Le'Veon Bell. The true freshman has
averaged 94.2 yards per game so far.
Michigan State's upset of then-No.
11 Wisconsin propelled the Spartans
ahead of the Wolverines in this week's
AP and coaches polls.
Michigan State has won the last
two meetings between the teams, and
that includes last season's heartbreak-
ing loss in overtime. Talk of "little
brother" has simmered and turned
into a running joke up in East Lansing.
"Trust me, we talk about (the
game) quite a bit and not just because
they won the last two years," Michi-
gan coach Rich Rodriguez said Mon-
day. "It's no less important to us as it
is to them."
Rodriguez joked that he doesn't
have a countdown clock to the annual
game, like Dantonio implemented
after he was hired by the Spartans. He
said he counts down to each upcom-
ing game just the same.
Still, if Rodriguez wins this game,
it will be the biggest victory of his
coaching career at Michigan.
"They are all big, but this one is
bigger," Rodriguez said. "The rivalry
games are always bigger. I'm sure they
will tell you the same thing. It's a huge
thing for both teams every year. The
more you win, there's more at stake,
and there's more at stake this year
because both teams are undefeated."

Breakdown: Wolverines should expect
toughest game yet against in-state rivals

Troy Clack and redshirt freshman kicker Brendan Gibbons look on at Michigan's spring game in April,

"They didn't even call me. I had to
show up at the front door of Schem-
bechler Hall, and there was a list of
the people being asked to come back.
It was like high school."
Needless to say, Clack's name
wasn't on the list. And a few days later,
he saxv Rodriguez's call for kickers.
When Clack read the quote on his
friend's Blackberry that night, he
shook his head. Was it even possible
to walk on and be the guy? He didn't
know, and he probably never would.
Today, he's back in the swing of
being a normal student. Last week, he
spent time at engineering career fairs,
which he says would have never been
a possibility if he were on the football
team .

"It was kind of like chasing a
dream," Clack says. "I dreamed my
whole life of playing for the Michi-
gan Wolverines. But at the end of
the day, I'm here for school. But you
know, I wouldn't trade that moment:
the spring game, the players, being on
the team, I wouldn't trade that for the
world ... All thins come to an end I
guess. At the end of the day... maybe
this happened for a reason."
Clack would be one of many to try
for that revolving door at the kicker
position.
Mark Rulkowski, a trombonist in
the marching band, spent all his high
school days playing soccer and only
started kicking footballs during the
band's touch football league. He tried
out at Clack's most recent tryout and
didn't make the cut.

Adam Mael, a senior from Potomac,
Maryland and another prospective
kicker, was pretty sure he'd never
make the team, but that didn't stop
hint from trying out at every tryout
since Rodriguez's first in the spring
of Mael's freshman year. They were
all faces in a fairly large crowd now,
ordinary guys with an extraordinary
experience.
Mael's efforts were rewarded when
Rodriguez approached hint at the
team's most recent tryout. The coach
told him that he had "seen (him)
around here before" and that his "leg
is definitelygetting stronger."
"It's been one of if not the best
experience I've had in my four years
here," Mael said. "It's an opportunity
to be a part of Michigan football ..
how could you possibly pass that up?"
For Mael and Rulkowski, it was
abouta love for the game, for theart
of kicking and for Michigan football
that kept them coming back.
For Clack, it was those moments:
touching the banner, kicking in front
of his friends at the spring gante, that
made everything worth it, despite
the heartbreaking fiale.
Broekhuizen may very well kick
the rest of the season, and the Wol-
verines will surely need someone as
Big Ten season gets into fullswing
"There's going to come a point in
time where we have to snake field
goals," Rodriguez said. "And it's
probably going to come down to a
game or two where we have to make
one to win it."
But until then, walk-ons like Jke
Matelic, who made the final roster,
wait for their shot at kicking inside
the Big House.
You'd think that if ever there was
a time to get on the team, it's right
now," Clack says. "But it's not as easy
as it sounds.
"But I gave it hell, and I wouldn't
trade it for the world."

The Michigan football team kicked
off its Big Ten slate last weekend with
a 42-35 win over Indiana in Bloom-
ington. This week, the Wolverines
come back to Michigan Stadium to
take on their in-state rivals from just
up I-94.
Though Michigan emerged from
Bloomington with the victory, the
game only accentuated the Wol-
verines' struggles on defense. The
Michigan secondary allowed Indiana
quarterback Ben Chappell to throw
for 480 yards and three touchdowns,
and Michigan only squeaked outa win
because of a sensational last-minute
drive orchestrated by sophomore
quarterback Denard Robinson.
This weekend's game against Mich-
igan State will be Michigan's first true
test of the season.
MICHIGAN RUN OFFENSE VS.
MICHIGAN STATE RUN DEFENSE
Michigan will go into this game
down at least one running back, pos-
sibly two. Fitzgerald Toussaint is still
out with the shoulder injury he sus-
tained against Bowling Green, and
Mike Shaw is listed as probable with
his knee still bothering him.
Even with those two out, the Wol-
verines' run game should be tough
to stop. Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez has been talking about spreading
around the playing time, so expect to
catch some glimpses of some younger
ballcarriers.
And of course, there's No. 16. The
nation's leading rusher will surely
carry the ball at least a few times on
Saturday.
But even with all of those weapons,
the Spartans still have a chance of
containing the run game. Their line-
backers are very, very good, especially
senior Greg Jones, who was voted the
preseason Big Ten defensive player of
the year.
The jury is still out on whether it's
even possible to gameplan around
Robinson, but if Michigan State is able
to do it, you can bet Jones will play a
big role.
EDGE: MICHIGAN
MICHIGAN PASS OFFENSE VS.
MICHIGAN STATE PASS DEFENSE
The Michigan pass offense came
alive last weekend in Bloomington as
the Wolverines racked up 277 yards
through the air. Redshirt junior wide-
out Junior Hemingway joined redshirt

sophomore Roy Roundtree and junior
Darryl Stonum as a legitimate down-
field threat, grabbing three catches for
129 yards and a touchdown.
Robinson has been great throwing
the ball this season and he should be
able to continue that against Michigan
State. The Spartans rank third to last
in the Big Ten in passing yards allowed
(Michigan is last). The weak spot on
the Spartan defense is undoubtedly its
secondary, and the Wolverines should
be able to take advantage of it during
the game on Saturday.
EDGE: MICHIGAN
MICHIGAN STATE RUN OFFENSE
VS. MICHIGAN RUN DEFENSE
Michigan State ranks fourth in the
Big Ten in rushing and sports a talent-
ed backfield, led by sophomore Edwin
Baker and spectacular freshman
Le'Veon Bell. Bell rushed for 114 yards
in the Spartans' overtime victory over
Notre Dame, and he ran for 75 yards
against Wisconsin.
The Wolverines have suffered from
inconsistent play at the linebacker
spot this season.
Seniors Jonas Mouton and Obi
Ezeh have had their strong showings
but have also had very weak games,
such as the narrow win over Mas-
sachusetts in which the Minutemen
running backs gained 217 yards on the
ground.
EDGE: MICHIGAN STATE
MICHIGAN STATE PASS OFFENSE
VS. MICHIGAN PASS DEFENSE

Sophomore quarterback Denard Robinson leads the nation in rushing yards through five games this season.


Michigan's secondary has been
nearly non-existent this season, and
the stats back it up. The Wolverines
have allowed 1,539 yards of passing
this year, good for dead last in the con-
ference by almost 300 yards. Many
Michigan fans have resigned them-
selves to the fact that the Wolverines
will have to outscore opponents to
win, and this looks to be true against
Michigan State.
The Spartans boast a premier pass-
er in junior Kirk Cousins. The quarter-
back has completed almost 68 percent
of his passes for 1,132 yards and nine
touchdowns this season. Cousins has
plenty of weapons around him, the
most prominent being senior Mark
Dell. Dell leads the team in receiving
yards with 263 and is a proven deep
threat.
The young Michigan secondary
will certainly have its hands full with
an experienced quarterback and solid
playmakers for the Spartans. This

weekend's game against Michigan
State will be Michigan's first true test
of the season.
EDGE: MICHIGAN STATE
SPECIAL TEAMS
Michigan and Michigan State
appear to be on opposite ends of the
spectrum when it comes to special
teams play this year.
Michigan still doesn't know what
will happen when it needs to kick a
field goal.
In fact, the Wolverines don't even
know who will run out onto the field
in that situation.
The Spartans have an experienced
kicker in sophomore Dan Conroy.
Conroy leads the Big Ten in field goal
percentage at 100 percent, going7-of-
7 on the year.
Not to mention Michigan State has
a Ray Guy award candidate at punter
in senior Aaron Bates. The Spartans
rank second in the Big Ten punting
yard average. And well, Will Hag-
erup could be better.

INTANGIBLES
Michigan State may seem to have
the intangibles on its side. The Spar-
tans have a chance to come to Ann
Arbor and beat Michigan for the third
time in a row since Mike Hart's famous
"little brother" comment. They also
will be playing for coach Mark Dan-
tonio, who recently suffered a heart
attack and experienced complications
involving a blood clot in his leg.
Butno one wants togetbeat athome
by their in-state rival, and Michigan is

no different. The Wolverines will have
to win this game in order to prove to
the doubters that this team isn't last
year's team.
As always, expect a dogfight. These
two schools are full of in-state kids
who have been playing against each
other since they were in sixth grade.
There is definitely no shortage of bad
blood.

It was Sept. 18, a half hour or so after the Wol-
verines' close victory over FCS opponent Massa-
chusetts, and Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez was
frustrated.
He was frustrated with the game and the close
score, his defense and a host of other things. But
the problem with his special teams, it was unique.
So Rodriguez made an announcement at the
podium - one that many people, on campus and in
the building, heard loud and clear.
"Any student out there who's enrolled at the
University and is in good academic standing and
a good guy and can kick field goals and can kick
the ball into the end zone, we'll have another try-
out for you," Rodriguez declared. But his message
brought more questions than answers.
For Seth Broekhuizen and Brendan Gibbons,
both redshirt freshman kickers, it seemed to be a
warning.
After Gibbons began the season as the starter,
he quickly fell out of favor with the coaching staff.
He had made only one of four field goal attempts
and even had an extra point blocked. Things just
weren'tgoing his way.
Broekhuizen came in against Notre Dame for
the first time to kick the final extra point. Follow-
- ing that point after, Broekhuizen took the starting
duties, but he missed his only field goal try.
For two games now, the Wolverines haven't
attempted a field goal. And Rodriguez seems to
like it that way.
"It's nice for me," Rodriguez said last Monday.
"I'd rather score touchdowns. Fortunately for me,
we've been pretty good in the red zone as far as
efficiency, getting touchdowns instead of field
goals, and we need to do that"
But the day will come, Rodriguez knows, where
the team will need the kicker to deliver a victory
on the end of his foot.
Rodriguez spoke with the media just before the
Bowling Green game, and he began with a grin. A

student had stopped him in the parking lot of the
Junge Family Champions Center. He told Rodri-
guez that he had read what the coach said in the
paper that week and asked if he could try out for
kicker.
Maybe that kid never made it to the practice
field. But it made one thing clear, the kicker posi-
tion, one of the most dramatic and agonizing in all
of sports, which for Michigan hadbeen held by the
likes of Jay Feely and Hayden Epstein, was wide
open.
Troy Clack always thought of himself as more of
a wide receiver.
But there was no mistaking that the senior at
Swan Valley High School in Saginaw, Michigan
was a kicker and a punter - and a pretty good one
at that.
In the 2006 regional finals, a night that Clack
describes as "mucky and muddy", Clack lined up
for a 43-yard field goal with the game basically
on the line. With Swan Valley trailing by just one
point, a comeback would seem plausible, but the
weather had kept the Vikings out of the end zone
for much of the day. This was it.
He lined up and put it straight through the
uprights to secure the win. Later that season, he
was named second team All-State at the kicker
position and offered a full ride to local college Sag-
inaw Valley State.
He turned it down. Instead, he opted to go to
Michigan, his mother's alma mater.
"I had kind of abandoned the prospects of play-
ing football," Clack says. "I came here to be part
of the college experience, do straight academics.
Michigan was always the school I wanted to go to."
It was hard to ignore Rodriguez's first
announcement in 2008, though. Rodriguez, hav-
ing been a walk-on himself at West Virginia, rel-
ishes the walk-on program. At Michigan it turned

out players like Jordan Kovacs, who has started
for the last two years and Kevin Leach, who gets
significant playing time at linebacker. Now, there
would be a campus-wide tryout in Rodriguez's
first spring with the team.
So Clack decided he would do it. It would at
least be a good story to tell, he figured.
Among the masses who turned out for the try-
out, Clack says 18 came to try out for the Wolver-
ines' open kicker spot. The practice began, and
after kicking a few balls to get warmed up along
with the other kickers, Clack unloaded and nearly
made a 55-yard field goal. But it hit the crossbar.
Rodriguez noticed the extraordinarly long kick
and approached the young kicker. "Almost had it,
son," he told Clack, who
still glows when he tells
the story.
He didn't make the Any stude
team that year though,
and the next year he was at the U
forced to miss tryouts
because of a previously academic
planned ski trip with
a few of his friends. In guy and
the spring of 2010, how-
ever, the junior made canekick t
a call to Brad Labadie,
who at that time was we'll have
the director of football
operations. Labadie had
known Clack's high school coach and got him a
tryout: that Thursday at 5:30.
Clack showed up for practice early that day.
He parted through the chaotic gathering of mon-
strous athletes, where he says he "stuck out like
a sore thumb," and he began the tryout, with just
him and another guy.
He kicked four balls in kickoff format to show
Rodriguez that he had potential, with the first
three landing around the 10- or five-yard-line. But

he really wanted to bury one in the back of the end
zone, so he asked the coach for permission to get
one more chance.
His next kick went just how he had planned.
After the boot, Rodriguez walked over to him.
"He said, 'We're going to keep you around for
two weeks, kind of test you out, like a trial period.'
"Obviously, I was on cloud nine. I was in the
door."
With football practice consuming his life, Clack
dropped one of his engineering classes and tried to
work around his mandatory three-hour labs.
But he speaks fondly of his first days with the

team - getting his helmet fitted, being handed
his jersey and seeing his name on a locker next to
freshman running back Stephen Hopkins.
"You're like the new guy at school," Clack says
when asked about those first days. "It's definitely
an interesting transition from being a normal kid,
going along on campus, to being a varsity athlete.
You meet all these guys who you read about and
see on ESPN. All of a sudden, those guys, the Tates
and the Denards, you're eating next to them."

He was surprised about one thing he noticed
in that first week though. The team, Clack says,
doesn't have a coach who knows the nuts and bolts
of kicking techniques, or one who knows what to
look for when his players kick in practice.
So the specialists, at times, end up coaching
themselves, he says.
"When you have kickers that are doing their
own thing at practice, it's great because we can
self-coach and coach each other," Clack says. "But
that can onlytake you so far. I didn't havea kicking
coach in high school either, but you come to a big
school, you think you're goingto have some sort of
coach that knows how to kick and will give you a
few pointers."
Even Zoltan Mesko, a former Michigan punter
and now in his rookie year with the New England
Patriots, taught him a thing or too about the sci-
ence of punting and kicking. Clack says he never
saw the same from special teams and secondary
coach Tony Gibson.
Rodriguez says that lack of a kicking coach with
specific expertise on staff is not that uncommon
though, "at any level of football."
"Coach Gibson and I certainly aren't going to
be the experts as far as kicking expertise is con-
cerned," Rodriguez said in his teleconference
Wednesday. "A lot of our (coaches) have experi-
ence. When you coach some years at the college
level, all of us have dealt with the guys in some
respects. But just to be a pure 'kicking coach,' I
don't.know."
Clack felt like he was on his way to impressing
his coaches, until a quad problem began to nag in
practice, an injury he thinks he sustained in the
first tryout. The injury limited him at times, giv-
ing the other kickers more opportunities to show
their potential.
"They saw that I had potential," Clack says.
"But I wasn't able to bring it on a consistent basis
because of this plaguing quad injury. I'd kick a few,

and I'd just have to stop. It felt like someone was
taking a knife and stabbing it in the middle of my
leg."
But he was able to play through the injury and
remained neck-and-neck with fellow walk-ons
Jake Matelic and Curtis Beachum. All three were
invited to the spring game.
"Finding out I was going to dress for the spring
game, that was the culmination of this whole pro-
cess," he says.
The Wolverines still had no clear No. 1 kicker.
Gibbons, Michigan's scholarship kicker, seemed
to have a slight edge. Broekhuizen was a relative
unknown at the time, and Justin Meram, a for-
ward on the men's soccer team even held the start-
ing job at one point, according to Clack.
The door was wide open, and Clack was ready to
walk straight through it.
He knew he probably wouldn't kick during the
game, but he still held out hoping that out of some
off-chance his journey could come full circle. He
talks about how cool it felt to sign autographs for
kids, even if they didn't know his name, and about
the photos he wishes his mom would have taken of
his banner jump. "I got high up," he jokes.
But Clack never got into the game.
Afterward, he knew that the team's spring
meetings were coming. It was then, in Gibson's
office, when he and the rest of the kickers would
find out if they indeed were going to be MichigaY?
Wolverines.
Clack didn't have a good feeling about this.
After he missed a practice during the week lead-
ing up to the spring game for a mandatory exam,
Matelic had taken a slight lead among the walk-on
kickers, but Clack took it in stride.
"That Thursday (before the spring game) was.
my opportunity to beat him out. I knew they were
going to give it to Jake (Matelic). But I loved that
