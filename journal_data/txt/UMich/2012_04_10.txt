MEN'S BASKETBALL
After flirting
with the NBA,
Burke to stay

THE DOG DAYS

Freshman's return
makes Michigan a
top-10 candidate
By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
Trey Burke was told he should
stay. He was told he should go.
He was leaning toward staying
in school, and he was leaning
toward going pro. He solicited his
family members and coaches for
advice, and he was given unso-
licited advice from fans and rival
athletic directors.
When he was done being
stretched every which way, the
freshman point guard decided
he'll stay at Michigan for his
sophomore season.
"I just felt like I could develop
more, and we have a great shot
of competing for another Big Ten
Championship and competing for
a national championship," Burke
said in a press conference yester-
day.
After Michigan's season ended
in a 65-60 loss to Ohio in the sec-
ond round of the NCAA Tour-
nament, Burke started to look
at his NBA Draft prospects. He
consulted the NBA Draft Advi-
sory Board, and though he didn't
reveal what the board told him,
Burke said that the uncertainty

of where he would go in the draft
contributed to his decision to stay.
He was projected to be a second-
round pick by ESPN's Chad Ford.
Last Wednesday, rumors and
reports swirled that Burke had
decided to declare for the June
28 NBA Draft, but coincidentally,
that was the day Burke said he
decided to stay put. It could have
been that the reports were erro-
neous, or that Burke changed his
mind in the wake of the media
firestorm.
"(There) was a point where I
was considering leaving," Burke
said. "I was never really two feet
all the way in. Sometimes I was
more leaving and sometimes I
was more coming back. After
talking it over with the coaches
and with my family ... I think that
was the best decision for me. It
was more of a risk for me to leave
(and) declare for the NBA Draft."
Burke said the main thing
he would need to improve on to
become an NBA-caliber point
guard is his strength.
For a few days, Michigan fans
thought that their prized point
guard would be gone and-that the
Wolverines would need to find
a replacement, just as they had
done the year before when Burke
took over for point guard Darius
Morris, who left for the NBA after
his sophomore year.

State Court of Appeals
reinstates GSRA ban

Immediate effect
policy at center
of conflict
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
When a bill preventing grad-
uate student research assistants
from unionizing passed with
immediate effect in the state

Legislature in early March, the
debate over whether GSRAs
at the University could vote to
form a union finally appeared
to be finished.
However, the status of
GSRAs remains unclear as
the bill, House Bill 4262, has
become caught in a tense debate
between state Republicans and
Democrats over the proper use
of the immediate effect provi-
sion.

An Ingham County Circuit
Court judge ruled last week in
favor of the House Democrats,
stating that the Republicans
improperly used the immediate
effect - a decision which the
University's Board of Regents
expressed support of on April
2 by deciding to file an amicus
brief after a contentious 5-3
vote. Yesterday though, the
State of Michigan Court of
Appeals issued a stay on the

issue, allowing the law to go
back into effect until the court
can take a further look into the
issue.
In its decision, the court
ordered the case to be expedit-
ed. Without immediate effect,
the bill would take effect 90
days after the last day of the
legislative session, or March of
next year.
The bill in question amends

Swarming with robotic air-
crafts, hoop-shooting androids
and images of autonomous cars,
the North Campus Research
Complex appeared to be a scene
out of a science fiction film yes-
terday.
As part of a celebration of the
state of Michigan's achievements
in the field of robotics, the Uni-
versity co-sponsored an event
yesterday with the National Cen-
ter for Manufacturing Sciences -
a nonprofit consortium of North
American manufacturers. The
380 people in attendance listened
toapanel of professionals discuss
the role of the robotics industry
and watched demonstrations of
robots created by students at the
University and at other colleges
and high schools in the state, as
well as by government organiza-
tions and state industries.
U.S. Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.)
addressed the attendees at the
start of the event. He spoke about
the state universities' achieve-
ments in the robotics field and
about the potential for the new
technologies to create jobs.

Students under
18 encounter
housing, legal
difficulties
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily StaffReporter
While some upperclassmen
anxiously await their 21st birth-
days, another decidedly smaller
group of underclassmen are
awaiting an equally momentous
event - their 18th birthdays and
their entrance into adulthood.
Atthe start of the school year,
there were 741 17-year-old stu-
dents living in University Hous-

ing and eight residents who
were 16, out of a total of 6,211
full-time students, according to
Peter Logan, University Hous-
ing spokesman. Logan wrote in
ane-mail interview that Univer-
sity Housing does not typically
place students who are under
the age of 16 in residence halls,
but will make considerations on
a case-by-case basis.
"We examine the needs care-
fully for any student who will be
entering the University Housing
system," Logan wrote.
All residents must also elec-
tronically sign a housing con-
tract, and a parent must also
sign for those under the age of
18. Kinesiology freshman Anna
Li, who was 17 when she started

school in the fall, said having
her parents sign wasn't an issue.
Logan added that when it
comes to the disciplinary sys-
tem within University Housing,
age does not make a difference
and parents are notusuallynoti-
fied for minor behavioral issues
unless the instance is warrant-
ed. However, the Department of
Public Safety is another matter.
DPS spokeswoman Diane
Brown said DPS has to follow
legal protocol when dealing
with underage students, not-
ing there are different deten-
tion centers and court systems
depending on the person's age,
but these are dictated by state
law, not University policy.

LSA approves pass/ fail grading

30 year ago this week (April
11, 1972): The LSA Curriculum
Committee approved a plan that
allowed students to enroll in
any course on a pass/fail basis
for the fall 1973 semester, the
Michigan Daily reported.
The program was intended
mainly for introductory cours-
es, and students would have to
decide on a grading plan within
two or three weeks of the start
of classes.
LSA sophomore John Lande,
a student member of the com-
mittee, said the decision to
approve the plan was due to "the
increasing number of requests
for experiments in grading,"
and the popularity of pass/

fail courses that the Univer-
sity already offered, the Daily
reported.
Chemistry Prof. Daniel Lon-
gone expressed concern about
the plan and said "proponents
would have to demonstrate it to
be 'totally superior' to the cur-
rent grading system."
20 years ago this week (April
10, 1982): The University
received high rankings in "The
New York Times Selective
Guide to Colleges" by Edward
Fiske, which soon became a
popular book on campus, the
Daily reported.
On a five-star system of six
categories, the University was

rated five stars in academics
and three stars in social life
and quality of life. It was also
described as one of the "top five
or 10 schools in the country"
and the "mother of state univer-
sities."
Cliff Sjogren, the University's
director of admissions, said
he questioned the guidebook's
research methods and consid-
ered it a "great disservice" to
many colleges, though the Uni-
versity's review was favorable.
"I'm going to discourage my
staff from using it as a reference
with any potential students," he
said.

Facebook buys Instagram .

Photosharing
service sold for
$1 billion
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Facebook snapped up photo-
sharing service Instagram for
$1 billion in cash and stock --
its largest acquisition yet, as it
nears an IPO.
A wildly popular Phone app
that recently became available
on Android phones, Instagram
lets people apply filters to pho-
tos they shoot so that some
appear as if they've been taken
in the 1970s or on Polaroid cam-
eras.
Yesterday's deal -- by far the
biggest for an app -- trumped
Zynga's $200 million acquisi-
tion of OMGPop last month and
scored a megapayday for Insta-
gram's 27-year-old founder and
CEO, Kevin Systrom.
Speculation on Systrom's cut

ranged up to $400 million, with
venture capital firms getting
most of the rest. Instagram's
dozen or so employees could
divvy up an estimated $100 mil-
lion.
"This is an important mile-
stone for Facebook, because
it's the first time we've ever
acquired a product and com-
pany with so many users," Mark
Zuckerberg said in a blog post
announcing the news early yes-
terday.
He said Facebook, whose
stock is expected to start trading
in May, will run Instagram as an
independent company.
Not much will change with
the service, he said. Consumers
will still be able to run it on rival
social networks such as Twitter.
That's a departure from Face-
book's history of buying start-
ups and either integrating the
technology or shutting it down.
The acquisition of the San
Francisco-based company,

founded in March 2010, is
expected to close by the end of
June.
Instagram's steep price tag
-- roughly the same as Peet's
Coffee & Tea or Jack in the Box
-- raised eyebrows among many,
including analysts who drew
parallels with outlandish acqui-
sition deals associated with
the Internet bubble of the late
1990s.
"Facebook will never make
that $1 billion back, but it's still
smart," says Patrick Moor-
head, principal analyst at Moor
Insights & Strategy, who deemed
the move "defensive."
"Instagram was the only
thing challenging (Facebook's)
dominance in photo sharing,"
Moorhead says.
Digital photos are also a sign
of the times. While Instagram
fetched $1 billion, EastmanKo-
dak is mired in Chapter 11 bank-
ruptcy. It employs more than
17,000.

range rocket launch, images released yesterday show that North Korea appears to be preparing for a third nuclear test.

nuclear test preparations

Satellite shows
underground
tunnel, Obama
condems action
SEOUL, South Korea (AP)
- Recent satellite images show
North Korea is digging a new
underground tunnel in what
appears to be preparation for a
third nuclear test, according to
South Korean intelligence offi-
cials.
The excavation at North
Korea's northeast Punggye-ri
site, where nuclear tests were
conducted in 2006 and 2009, is
in its final stages, according to
a report by intelligence officials
that was shared yesterday with
The Associated Press.
Its release comes as North
Korea prepares to launch a long-
range rocket that Washington
and others say is a cover for
testing missile technology that
could be used to fire on the Unit-
ed States.
The Obama administration

said yesterday it would con-
sider both a rocket launch and
an underground nuclear test as
highly provocative and leave
Pyongyang more isolated.
"In each case this would be
an indication of North Korea's
decision at the leadership level
not to take the steps that are
necessary to allow North Korea
to end its isolation, to rejoin the
community of nations and to do
something about the extreme
poverty and depravation that
its people suffer," White House
spokesman Jay Carney told a
news briefing in Washington.
Observers fear a repeat of
2009, when international criti-
cism of the North's last long-
range rocket launch prompted
Pyongyang to walk away from
nuclear disarmament negotia-
tions and, weeks later, conduct
its second nuclear test. A year
later, 50 South Korean were
killed in attacks blamed on the
North.
"North Korea is covertly pre-
paring for a third nuclear test,
which would be another grave
provocation," said the intelli-

gence report, which cited U.S.
commercial satellite photos
taken April 1. "North Korea is
digging up a new underground
tunnel at the Punggye-ri nuclear
test site, in addition to its exist-
ing two underground tunnels,
and it has been confirmed that
the excavation works are in the
final stages."
Dirt believed to have been
brought from other areas is
piled at the tunnel entrance, the
report said, something experts
say is needed to fill up tunnels
before a nuclear test. The dirt
indicates a "high possibility"
North Korea will stage a nuclear
test, the report said, as plugging
tunnels was the final step taken
during its two previous under-
ground nuclear tests.
U.S. State Department spokes-
woman Victoria Nuland told
reporters she was not in a posi-
tion to confirm whether North
Korea was preparing for a nucle-
ar test after the rocket launch.
She said a launch would be
"highly provocative" and a
nuclear test "would be equally
bad, if not worse."

Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, center, telephones a potential voter from
a call center at his Pennsylvania campaign headquarters in Harrisburg, Pa., last Thursday.
Romney adds to campaign
to.-do list as likely no-minee

With break in
primaries, Romney
looks to improve
fundraising
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -
Mitt Romney faces a daunting
to-do list as he transitions into
the role of likely Republican
presidential nominee.
Among the tasks: Raise
as much money as possible
for the general election cam-
paign against President Barack
Obama. Hire more people and
send them to the most criti-
cal states in the fall race. Hone
his message to appeal to voters
across the political spectrum.
And do it all quickly while
fending off challenges from GOP
rivals who refuse to quit the pri-
mary race.
Obama, with the advantages
of an incumbent, is well ahead of
Romney on fundraising, organi-
zation and broad pitches to vot-
ers. So Romney can be expected
to spend part of his time over
the next three weeks trying to
catch up. There's a break in the
primaries lasting until April
24, when several Northeastern
states vote.
Romney also must start
thinking about a running mate
and strategy to amass the 270
electoral votes needed to win

the White House on Nov. 6.
The former Massachusetts
governor must prepare to put
his imprint on the Republican
National Committee and figure
out how to achieve unity with
a conservative base that has
resisted his candidacy. In the
general election, party loyal-
ists will be counted on to raise
money and get out the vote.
"I do think the Romney team
is thinking about how they put
in place their fall campaign,"
said Terry Nelson, a former top
aide to President George W.
Bush. "But they clearly have
some contests to get through, so
they won't be able to turn their
eyes entirely to that."
There's little question that
Romney will clinch the nomi-
nation in June, if not earlier. He
has a wide lead in the race for
the 1,144 delegates required to
secure the GOP nomination. But
chief rival Rick Santorum says
he'll press on at least through
the end of the month. Pennsyl-
vania, which he represented
in the House and Senate, votes
April 24, along with Connecti-
cut, Delaware, New York and
Rhode Island.
In hopes of convincing
Republicans it's time to rally
behind Romney, leading Repub-
licans such as Sen. Marco Rubio
of Florida and Rep. Paul Ryan of
Wisconsin have endorsed him
recently; both are viewed as

potential running mates. Former
Rhode Island Gov. Don Carcieri
has said he would back Romney
and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad
may announce his support soon.
Romney is sounding more
like a general election candi-.
date each day. "It isn't about
one person or about even one
party,"he said lastweek. "We're
Republicans and Democrats
in this campaign, but we're all
connected with one destiny for
America."
After a break for the Easter
holiday, Romney is expected to
plunge back into fundraising in
New York and South Florida.
That's none too soon for Repub-
licans, given Obama's fundrais-
ing advantage.
"Ultimately, the thing we
have to focus on is getting the
general election money raised,"
said Brian Ballard, of Florida,
one of Romney's top fundraisers.
Obama, without a Democratic
challenger, has been free to raise
money strictly for the general
election. He's so far raised more
than $300 million for his re-
election campaign and the Dem-
ocratic National Committee.
Romney can't raise cash for the
Republicans until he clinches
the nomination, but he's brought
in more than $75 million for his
campaign.
Romney aides said solicita-
tions for general election dona-
tions were starting to go out.

Assad's forces shell
refugee camp on
eve of cease-fire
BEIRUT (AP) - Syrian
forces opened fire across two
tense borders yesterday, killing
a TV journalist in Lebanon and
wounding at least six people in
a refugee camp in Turkey on the
eve of a deadline for a cease-fire
plan that seems all but certain
to fail.
A witness at the Turkish
camp said he saw two refugees
killed, although that account
could not be independently con-
firmed.
Across Syria, activists
reported particularly heavy
violence with more than 125
people killed in the past two
days.
The Obama administration
expressed outrage at the vio-
lence spilling over the frontiers,
saying the Syrian government
appeared to have little commit-
ment to the peace plan that was
negotiated by former U.N. chief
Kofi Annan.
The latest bloodshed was a
sign of how easily Syria's neigh-
bors could be drawn into a
regional conflagration as Presi-
dent Bashar Assad's crackdown
on a year-old uprising becomes
increasingly militarized,
despite desperate diplomatic
efforts.
Annan brokered a deal that
was supposed to begin with
Syria pulling its troops out
of population centers by this
morning, with a full cease-fire
by both sides within 48 hours.
But hopes for the plan collapsed
after a fresh wave of violence
and new demands by the regime
for written guarantees that the
opposition will lay down arms
first.
Naci Koru, Turkey's deputy
foreign minister, said todays_
deadline for the withdraw-
al has become "void at this
stage," state-run TRT television
reported.
The U.N. estimates some
9,000 people have been killed
in Syria since March 2011, when
the uprising began with mostly
peaceful protests against Assad.
But a government crackdown
led many Syrians take up weap-
ons, transforming the conflict
into an insurgency.
Yesterday, Syrian forces fired
across the border into a refugee
camp in Turkey, wounding at
least six people, authorities said.
The soldiers were believed
to be firing at rebels who tried
to escape to the refugee camp
after ambushing a Syrian mili-
tary checkpoint, killing six
soldiers, according to the Brit-
ain-based activist group Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights.
The troops kept firing as they
pursued rebels who made a run
for the camp, sending bullets
whizzing across the frontier,
the Observatory said.
Turkish authorities said four
Syrians and two Turks were
wounded, including a Turkish
translator who had entered the
camp to try to calm an anti-

Assad protest.
But one witness, Tareq
Abdul-Haqq, told The Associat-
ed Press by telephone from the
camp that he saw two refugees
killed in front of him.
He said the two were in a
crowd that was shouting anti-
Assad slogans during a dem-
onstration that erupted after
word got through the camp that
rebels had ambushed the Syrian
checkpoint.
"They started chanting 'God
is Great!' and the army and the
security forces targeted them,"
Abdul-Haqq, 26, told The Asso-
ciated Press by telephone.
The Turkish Foreign Min-
istry also reported two deaths,
but under different circum-
stances.
According to the ministry, 21
wounded Syrians were brought
to Turkey yesterday, but that
two of them died soon after. It
was not immediately possible to
reconcile the two accounts.
"Syrian citizens who have
fled the violence by the current
Syrian regime are under the
full protection of Turkey," the
Turkish Foreign Ministry said
in astatement.
Turkey shelters some 24,000
Syrian refugees, including hun-
dreds of army defectors, and
has floated the ideasofsettingup
a buffer zone inside Syria if the
flow of displaced people across
its border becomes overwhelm-
ing.
The countries share a
911-kilometer (566-mile) bor-
der, and parts of southern Tur-
key are informal logistics bases
for rebels, who collect food and
other supplies and smuggle
them to comrades across the
border in Syria.
Yesterday's shooting was
believed to be the first inside
Turkey, although there have
been similar cross-border
attacks into Lebanon.
Syrian troops fired about 40
rounds across the border into
northern Lebanon, killing a
cameraman for Lebanon's Al
Jadeed television station, the
station said. The camera crew
were in Lebanese territory.
Ali Shaaban, who was born
in 1980, was shot through the
chest as he sat in ascar and died
on the way to the hospital, Leb-
anese security officials said.
"If you see the car, you would
think it was in a war zone,"
Shaaban's colleague, Hussein
Khreis, told the station. "It is
completely destroyed from the
bullets."
The station said on its web-
site that its staff "crawled for
around two hours, during
which we were under constant
fire from the Syrian army."
"I ask forgiveness from Ali's
family because I couldn't do
anything for him," Khreis said
in a broadcast on Al Jadeed,
breaking into tears.
Shaaban is at least the ninth
journalist killed while cover-
ing the conflict in Syria, includ-
ing award-winning French TV
reporter Gilles Jacquier, pho-
tographer Remi Ochlik and
Britain's Sunday Times corre-
spondent Marie Colvin.

Engineering the future
Universities and students must focus on sciences
he importance of higher education can't be understated. In
order to compete in an increasingly global economy, Ameri-
cans are seeking degrees at high rates. Still, the demands of
an advanced economy aren't being met by current graduates' quali-
fications. With the improvement of the U.S. economy over recent
months, more manufacturing and information technology companies
are looking to hire qualified engineers but have to face the reality of a
talent shortage. The shortage, which may be caused by a lack of guid-
ance for students toward their majors of interest, is pushing up the
unemployment rate and hurting the economy. Therefore, efforts have
to be made to change the situation and bring nore students to the
College of Engineering.

"Everybody has this uneasy feeling... You're
out enjoying this nice March weather,
but you know it's not a good thing."
- Climate scientist Jerry Meehl from the National Center for
Atmospheric Research about record temperatures throughout
the United States last month, as reported by Time magazine.

Guarding the Great Lakes

Even as the economy struggles to get back
on track, job growth last month was slower
than economists expected - jobs in high-
tech and engineering fields remain open. The
Engineering Society of Detroit hosted a job
fair in Novi, Mich. last month, and even in a
state with high unemployment, there were
six job openings for each candidate. The
Detroit Free Press reported that out-of-state
applications were able to fill some of the open
positions. Other companies looking to hire
left the job fair with a total of 3,500 unfilled
positions. Experts have cited lack of skilled
workers as an aspect of continued high rates
of unemployment around the nation.
Before students get to college, they should
be encouraged to study engineering. Michi-
gan high schools, for example, should place
more emphasis on science classes that may
lead students to an interest in engineering. It
may also be helpful to issue more State H-1B
visas - which allow foreign workers to work
specialty occupations in the U.S. - so talent-
ed foreign students could fill the shortage for

a temporary period.
The most important way to guide students
toward jobs that this economy needs filled is
to make colleges - engineering along with
all majors - more affordable. The Univer-
sity's College of Engineering is consistently
ranked as one of the top undergraduate engi-
neering schools in the country. Last summer,
tuition was increased about 7 percent. While
the University tries to rein in its spending,
state funding has also decreased drastically
over the past decade. Michigan must return
to increased higher education funding, and
colleges must do their part to make higher
education more affordable. The country
needs a well-educated work force to advance
its economy.
Michigan should start working to nurture
more qualified engineers, since many manu-
facturing and high-tech companies are now
facing shortages of engineering positions.
As a top institution of higher education, the
University must lead this effort to benefit the
state economy.

remember the summer that
zebra mussels finally made it to
Platte Lake - an annual vaca-
tion spot for
my family near
Traverse City in
Northern Michi-
gan. It doesn't
stand out in my
mind because '
I was appalled
by the ecologi- JOE
cal havoc caused
by the invasive SUGIYAMA
species - those
aren't exactly
the thoughts of a 10-year-old. No, I
remember that summer because I
sliced my foot on one of the mussel's
sharp shells and didn't catch a damn
fish the entire trip because the natu-
ral food chain in the lake had been
thrown out of whack.
Though my first run-in with the
mollusks was about 12 years ago,
the zebra mussels have been run-
ning rampant in the Great Lakes
for about 25 years, ever since they
were dumped by a European ship's
infested ballast water. In that time,
they've been outcompeting native
species for resources and blanket-
ing the lakebeds to such an extent
that scientists claim that there is no
way to reverse the damage done. Our
only hope is to mitigate the situation
as best we can.
Enter the U.S. Coast Guard.
In addition to protecting the
people on our shores, the Coast
Guard is also interested in saving
the shores themselves. As of last
month, the Coast Guard issued a fed-
eral rule that requires all seafaring
ships traveling via the St. Lawrence
Seaway from the Atlantic Ocean to
the Great Lakes to install onboard
ballast water treatment systems. A
ship's ballast water is typically taken

from the ocean, used for stability as
it travels and is then discharged into
the Great Lakes once the ship no lon-
ger needs it. This discharge is where
invasive species such as zebra mus-
sels have been successfully stowed
for years.
This water treatment system
would most likely include some sort
of filtration coupled with a disin-
fection agent. But one of the biggest
problems facing ship owners is the
reduction in cargo space taken up
by the new water treatment system.
Small and sleek will be the name
of the ballast water management
game - a game that, according to
an April 7 New York Times article
will generate about $35 billion in
revenue in ten years as the new
rules are implemented.
One drawback with the Coast
Guard's new regulations is the speed
at which it's moving. The rule will
only be enforced on newly built
ships. Those already on the water
will be allowed to continue with-
out the new systems until they need
maintenance, which means that it
could be 2021 before the new rule
fully takes effect.
Thom Cmar, a lawyer for the
Natural Resources Defense Council,
claims that "the industry's had fair
warning that this was coming," and
such a long grace period for those
ships already on the water is "unjus-
tified," as reported in the article.
A similar sentiment seems to have
taken hold of the environmentalist
community, which is concerned that
Europe's current "killer shrimp"
issue - a predatory species invad-
ing from West Asia - could quickly
become a problem in the Great
Lakes. According to the Times arti-
cle, biologist Tom Nalepa seems to
think that if these freshwater shrimp
make it to the Great Lakes, they're

"going to cause as many changes as
the zebra mussel."
Ballast water *
regulations may
not be enough.
It's pretty great something is
finally being done about the whole
irreversible invasive species situ-
ation we have going on in the
Great Lakes. But I think we may
be a little better served addressing
these environmental issues before
there, isn't a solution for them. I'm
not trying to minimize any of the
efforts currently underway by the
Coast Guard or the U.S. Environ-
mental Protection Agency - who
are expected to come out with their
own regulations on ballast water by
the end of the year - but nipping
these issues in the bud as they're
happening is the key to protecting
our most valuable resources.
The Coast Guard's new regula-
tions are a tremendous first step,
but it's unacceptable to not have the
regulation in full swing for another
nine years. This new ballast water
treatment requirement for ships is
something that needs to be done
promptly, before another summer
of fishing is ruined by a bunch of
killer shrimp.

Let's make history together

0

A grandparent is a gift, and for the first
22 years of my life, I was blessed by my rela-
tionship with my grandfather, Mike Wallace.
A grandparent's knowledge is often lost on
us. They come from a different era, and are
shaped by different events and expectations.
Often, there is little in common to bond and
connect over. I, however, was lucky to follow
in my grandfather's footsteps and attend the
University of Michigan. Throughout my life,
the University bridged the 71-year age gap
that separated my grandfather and me.
All of us are constantly reminded that the
University community connects students and
alumni alike. We encounter it when we wear a
Michigan hat and a stranger yells "Go Blue!"
My Michigan connection began in 1935 when
Mike Wallace first arrived in Ann Arbor. He
grew up here. His long career in journalism
began when curiosity got the best of him, and
he wandered into the University's radio sta-
tion. The rest, they say, is history.,
Mike went on to interview every president
from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton. In the
wake of the Iranian hostage crisis, he sparred
with Ayatollah Khomeini. The civil rights
leaders he interviewed, including Martin
Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, inspired him.
His career stretched from the newsroom of
The Michigan Daily in the 1930s to the Irani-
an Presidential Palace in 2006 when he ques-
tioned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an
interview that resulted in his 21st and final
EmmyAward. th
But even after all the interviews, all the

pointed questions and all the accolades and
awards that followed his journalism career,
he still was drawn back to Ann Arbor. He gave
back to the University that marked the start of
his career, not because he had to, but because
he wanted to. Because he loved this school and
appreciated all that it did for him.
When Mike and my grandmother Mary
donated the house for the Knight-Wallace Fel-
lows at Michigan, it was not an empty handout
to the University. Rather, I saw it as an encour-
agement to others to engage their curiosity
- much in the same way he did when he wan-
dered into the radio station. The fellowship he
proudly supported affords world-renowned
journalists the opportunity to come study and
live at the University, with the expectation
that their year at this school will spur growth
on a personal and professional level.
His love of Michigan was not a guarded
secret. He lauded the University of Michigan
as a "top rate academic institution," he cele-
brated our football team and shared his pas-
sion for the school with his grandchildren.
His love for this school transcended the more
than 70 years that separated us in age, and I
have come to love the University for many of
the same reasons he did. Mike Wallace was
the start of my Michigan community. From
the moment I was born to the day he passed
away, this University connected us in shared
memories and humbled admiration.
Lowell Bourgeois is an LSA senior
and is Mike Wallace's grandson.

Two weeks ago, 20 University students descended
on Washington, D.C. for the third annual J Street
National Conference. The conference's theme was
"Making History," and together with more than 2,500
other attendees - including more than 650 students
from 125 schools - we made history.
This was the largest J Street conference in history.
Never before have so many pro-peace advocates come
together in one place to stand up for a two-state solu-
tion that includes a Jewish and democratic state of
Israel alongside an independent state of Palestine.
There were numerous speakers of note. Former
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert gave the keynote
speech at the conference's Gala Dinner..He expressed
his belief in Israel's partner in peace, Mahmoud Abbas,
the president of the Palestinian Authority. His pas-
sion and conviction could have convinced any person
who may have doubted the possibility of a resolution.
Amos Oz, the most famous novelist in Israel's history,
told the conference that it was time for Israel and the
Palestinians to move from their painfully tangled rela-
tionship to one where each could live separately and
independently. Oz told J Street that he had waited a
long time for our organization to exist.
The energy of the conference, however, can't - and
won't - remain in D.C. Over the next two weeks, we
will be asking student leaders from groups across cam-
pus to sign a simple, yet strong'declaration: "We sup-
port vigorous American diplomatic leadership toward
achieving a two-state resolution to the Israeli-Pales-
tinian conflict."
To many, this statement reads as obvious - of course
our government should be encouraging peace. Yet, the
harsh reality is that our politics, when it comes to the
Israeli-Palestinian issue, are broken.
We know they're broken when the Florida Legisla-
ture passes a unanimous resolution saying the occu-
pied territories belong to Israel, when major candidates
for the U.S. presidency say "There are no Palestinians,"
and when an American president is hammered relent-
lessly as being insufficiently pro-Israel simply for pro-
posing negotiations based on the parameters set since
President Bill Clinton's go at negotiations in 2000: the
1967 lines with mutually agreed-upon land swaps.
Despite this rhetoric, without a two-state solution,
the conflict will likely continue for generations. We

need to act now.
This does not mean it's easy. Hamas continues to
promote virulent anti-Semitism and refuses to even
recognize Israel's right to exist as a state. As long as'
Hamas unilaterally- controls Gaza, condones send-
ing rockets across the border and does not change its
fundamental political outlook, a Palestinian state will
remain inconceivable.
On the other hand, the continued expansion of set-
tlements in the West Bank poses another great threat.
Over the past two decades, the number of Israeli set-
tlers in the area has more than tripled, which makes
drawing the contours of a Palestinian state even more
difficult. This is especially true in East Jerusalem,
where Palestinians are being systematically evicted
from their homes and replaced by ultra-religiousO
Jews, as we wrote about in The Michigan Daily last
semester. With each new settlement, it becomes hard-
er for Israel to propose a state that the Palestinian$
can accept.
This is why it's so unlikely that the parties will
resolve this conflict on their own. This is why our gov-
ernment has such an important role. Unfortunately, in
our politics there is little incentive for politicians to
encourage a two-state solution. Reshaping this politi-
cal landscape is why J Street was founded.
This is why our voices are so important. Two weeks
ago at the conference, we - the future of pro-Israel -
walked across Capitol Hill, talking to our members of
Congress about the need to fight for a two-state solu-
tion. We want to thank Congressmen John Dingell,
John Conyers III and Hansen Clarke for signing onto
the Cohen-Connolly-Yarmuth letter asking President
Barack Obama to recommit to the two-state solution. .
We ask that you, the leaders of this campus, do that
as well. Stand up and tell the public what the major-
ity of us here on campus already know. Sign our dec-
laration: "We support vigorous American diplomatic
leadership toward achieving a two-state resolution to
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict." Let's make the voice
of our generation heard. Let's continue to make his-
tory together.

Brown said if someone under
the age of 17 needs to be taken
into custody, they attempt to have
at least two officers on hand at all
times. She added that while most
University students are of age,
the University has an open cam-
pus, multiple summer camps and
the newly opened C.S. Mott Chil-
dren's and Von Voigtlander Wom-
en's Hospital, so younger people
often visit the University.
When University Housing
security suspects a student under
the age of 18 is consuming alcohol
in a residence hall, the policy is to
notify DPS. Brown said this policy
is in place to ensure that a parent
is notified and safety is ensured.
"The health (of students) is
always the primary concern,"
Brown said.
Li said she wishes this policy

SUSTAINABILITY

energy consumption at the Uni-
versity, as students often aren't
conscious about their electricity
use.
To combat this problem, the
University recently renovated sev-
eral residence halls and increased
overall* sustainability by imple-
menting energy-efficient technol-
ogy.
Robert Yurk, University direc-
tor of housing planning and
design, said the University is
attempting to surpass energy con-
sumption standards set forth by
the American Society of Heating,
Refrigerating and Air Condition-
ing Engineers.
"Our initiative is to exceed that
code by 30 percent so we're not
just meeting the minimum, but
exceeding that," Yurk said.
The newest energy conserva-
tion efforts will be implemented
during renovations on East Quad
and -Baits II Residence Halls this
summer, according to Logan.
"The work we are going to be
doingatBaits II this summer is not
only going to replace an old and
inefficient boiler, but also to look
at improving energy efficiency of
the windows and the roof system,"
Logan said.
Renovations to Couzens Resi-
dence Hall, which were com-
pleted in September, reused more
than 95 percent of the existing
building's external structures to
install low-flow shower heads,
" which aid in water conservation,
according to the University's
Division of Student Affairs.

a team from Google, designed -

other autonomous cars so that
intersections can run smoothly

traffic slowing down.
Some of the robots displayed

Underage students who are
treated at University Health Ser-
vices also have different proce-
dures from legal adults. UHS
director Robert Winfield, Univer-
sity chief health officer, also said
many of their policies were made
because of state law.
Winfield added that if there is a
"substantive problem," like stitch-
es or antibiotics, UHS will try its
best to get in contact with a parent
and get permission fist. However,
for minorillness like colds, parent
notification is not usually needed.
"We try to behave responsibly
and within the limits of what the
law dictates," Winfield said.
Even when an underage stu-
dent does not want their par-
ents notified, UHS is sometimes
required to do so in certain situ-
ations, Winfield said. However,
according to state law, doctors
are exempt from this requirement
if the medical treatment is about
STDs or drug additions.
At most emergency rooms,
when dealing with time-sensi-
tive medical issues involving an
underage student, policy is to
"stabilize" them and then make

every effort to call a parent, Win-
field said. If it is an emergency,
they will immediately begin
treatment and then try to contact
dependents.
LSA freshman Angubeen
Khan, a student who was 17 when
she began college, said she real-
ized that UHS did oot receive her.
medical forms upon starting at
the University. Many of the forms
required a parent's signature, so
it took extra time for the forms to
travel from her, to her parents and
then to UHS.
"It could have taken a day and
the process ended up taking two
weeks," Khan said.
Being underage can also hinder
student socially. Both Khan and
Li recalled not being able to have
fun with some of their friends
when they went to clubs in Ann
Arbor since they typically require
patrons to be at least 18 years old
to enter.
Despite this, they said they
were able to find other ways to
meet people and enjoy their time
at the University.
"I still found other things to
do," Khan said.

BURKE
From Page 1
Burke said he consulted Mor-
ris as he made his decision, and
Morris told him to make sure he
would have no.regrets about his
choice. Burke said he ultimately
made his decision on Wednesday
during his drive home to Colum-
bus.
With Burke's return, Michi-
gan remains a projected top-
10 team in the country next
season, aided by the arrival of
recruits Glenn Robinson III,
Mitch McGary, Nik Stauskas and
recently added point guard Spike
Albrecht.
"Losing our first game to Ohio
was one of the most disappoint-
ing times of the year for us,"
Burke said. "And I just felt like
we have some unfinished busi-
ness. With the recruits coming
in, with the returning players, I
feel like we have a great chance
of winning a national champion-
ship.

"I just saw how bright the
future was for this team."
It's the third-straight offsea-
son that Michigan coach John
Beilein has dealt with having his
best talent set their sights.a little
higher. After the 2009-10 season,
guard Manny Harris left after
his junior year, and last season,
Morris entered the draft after
his second year.
Burke, could have continued
the trend, but he chose to go the
other way.
"It's a good problem to have,"
Beilein said. "We've got some
young men that really have
potential to play in the NBA, so
we want them to look at this,
take their time, do it the right
way. We never want them to have
any regrets."
Burke's teammates were large-
ly uninvolved in the decision.
"Some of us would talk to
him here and there," sopho-
more guard Tim Hardaway Jr.
said. "But we knew it was a lot of
stress dealing with this, and we
tried to stand back as far as pos-

sible because we know it was a
tough decision."
Burke defied all expectations
this season. He turned out to be
just as good, or even better, than
Morris, leading Michigan to its
first Big Ten Championship since
1986 and racking up plenty of
accolades for it. After averaging
14.8 points, 3.5 rebounds and 4.6
assists, he was named Big Ten
co-Freshman of the Year, select-
ed to the All-Big Ten Second
Team and got the nod as an AP
All-America honorable mention.
He continued to challenge
these expectations well after the
season ended. Fans were sur-
prised when his father said that
Burke was "seriously consider-
ing" entering the draft, and he
dropped another surprise when
he decided to remain at Michi-
gan after many outside of the
program were resigned to him
leaving.
"Time will say what was the
best decision for him," Beilein
said. "I think it was a great deci-
sion for Michigan basketball."



Outside Ann Arbor, other Big
Ten universities have also made a
continued effort to focus on sus-
tainable efforts.
According to the Illinois Cli-
mate Action Plan, the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
is aiming to meet at least 5 per-
cent of its electrical energy needs
through renewable energy sys-
tems by 2015 and 25 percent of
these needs by 2025.
U of I spokesman Timothy
Andrew Blacker said Illinois has
achieved over 99, percent of the
school's seven-year goal in just
three years.
"These are indeed incredible
results but should not be taken
as an opportunity to change our
focus," Blacker said.
U of I has seen a 19-percent
decrease in energy consumption
in its main campus buildings in
the 2010 fiscal year, as compared
to the 2008 fiscal year.
Indiana University, mean-
while, is implementing similar
initiatives by setting achievement
goals for carbon neutrality
efforts. University officials there
have worked to spread behavior
modification strategies to stu-
dents and staff and utilize new
building designs to maximize
efficiency.
Benjamin Inskeep, IU's sus-
tainability metrics, evaluation
and planning intern, said the
school is attempting to control
energy use despite a growing stu-
dent population.
Inskeep said total energy con-
sumption at IU increased 15.8
percent from the 2005 fiscal year
to the 2010 fiscal year.
He added that between 2005
Choy, president of UM::Autonomy,
demonstrated his club's RoboB-
oat at the event. The autonomous
RoboBoat was created by the club
to compete at the International
RoboBoat Competition and is pro-
grammed to drive itself through
a buoy coarse and complete
tasks without instruction from a
human, Choy said.
Choy said he became interested
in both the project and robotics
because of the innovative spirit
he saw in his teammates.
"The definition of robotics is
pretty loose, so when people say
that they do robotics, I assume
they do anything as they want
with engineering," Choy said.
"Half of it is practical, but most
of it is just seeing if their crazy
ideas will work in the end. You
get around with a bunch of crazy
people that want to take engi-

and 2010, the school's student
population increased from 37,958
to 42,347. Total building square
footage and energy costs also
grew during the period, which
pressed the school to improve
energy efficiency.
Similar to IU and the Univer-
sity of Illinois, the University of
Michigan's past endeavors have
proven to be a success.
According to Planet Blue Oper-
ations, the University avoided
$5.2 million in utility costs in
2010 through Planet Blue's over-
sight. In addition, the University
has reduced overall energy use
by 14 percent since 2010 from the
Planet Blue energy-saving pro-
gram.
The Shapiro Undergradu-
ate Library, one of the buildings
working with Planet Blue Opera-
tions, has decreased energy con-
sumption by 37 percent in the last
fiscal year, which translates to
approximately $360,000 saved,
according to the program's site.
The UGLi also conserved gen-
eration of 1,125 metric tons per
year of carbon dioxide from 2010
to 2011, which is equivalent to
removing 225 automobiles from
the roads.
Despite an uptick in environ-
mental awareness in recent years,
Logan said progress cannot
continue without assistance of
University students, and the Uni-
versity plans to reduce and reallo-
cate $120 million through energy
conservation by 2017.
"We recognize the fact that
energy conservation and efficien-
cies in a residence hall depend a
great deal on student behavior,"
Logan said.
neering further and mess around
with their ideas."
After the demonstrations, the
University hosted a ceremony in
which the panel members award-
ed high school robotics teams
merits for their robots. Students
from the Advanced Technology
Academy in Dearborn won first
place.
Mary Jo Ferguson, the team
coordinator for the Advanced
Technology Academy, said the
team attended the event because
it helped them practice dem-
onstrating and promoting their
robot.
"We are trying to practice talk-
ing about ourselves and our robot
because we are interviewing for a
Rookie All-Star award," Ferguson
said. "What brought us here was
to meet sponsors, but we've met a
lot of other cool teams too."

GSIkA
From Page 1
the Public Employment Rela-
tions Act 336 of 1947 to explicitly
identify GSRAs as students, not
public employees, which disal-
lows unionization. The Republi-
can-controlled House passed the
bill with immediate effect. Two-
thirds of representatives must
vote in support of immediate
effect of a bill, but the House has
been passing bills with a simple
voice vote, and Democrats argue
that their request for a roll-call
vote wasn't honored.
This gap in implementa-
tion would give the Michigan
Employment Relations Com-
mission time to rule on whether
GSRAs can unionize, an issue it
was scheduled to be discussed
before the bill passed with
immediate effect.
MERC will hold its monthly
meeting today and the abil-
ity for GSRAs to unionize will
be discussed. While there was
no certainty that MERC would
issue any ruling on the issue,
Lynn Morison, an attorney for
the state Bureau of Employ-
ment Relations, said MERC
could theoretically vote on the
issue.
Still, Morison emphasized
that MERC focuses to rule
according to the legislature, not
against it.
"It is MERC's role to adminis-
ter the law as it is," Morison said.
"Now if the law is changed then
it will be MERC's role to admin-
ister whatever it's changed to.
As far as I know, MERC is not
in any kind of dispute with any
part of any other part of govern-
ment. We're just trying to do the
role that has been assigned to
MERC by the Legislature."

Rackham student Liz
Rodrigues, communications
chair of the Graduate Employ-
ees Organization, said GSRAs
had been negatively impacted
when the bill was passed with
immediate effect before the
case was scheduled to be heard
by MERC a month ago.
"The damage has already
been done," Rodrigues said.
"The MERC ruling has been
denied to the GSRAs so they
won't have a, chance to have
their status as workers recog-
nized."
Rodrigues said the next step
for GEO is a ballot initiative
in the fall to "protect collec-
tive bargaining rights." Unions
throughout the state are work-
ing to get an initiative on the
ballot that would forbid right-
to-work legislation.
Stephen Raiman, founder of
Students Against GSRA Union-
ization, said he was pleased
that the Ingham County Court
decision against immediate
effect was being reviewed, but
he added that he did not believe
it was appropriate for the bill
to be a political battle between
Republicans and Democrats,
"The court has decided to
leave our bill out of the parti-
san fight over legislative proce-
dure," Raiman said. "We're not
interested in being involved and
we're upset that the union and
the Democrats in the House of
Representatives have chosen to
involve us in this battle that we
want no part of."
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said he was "disappoint-
ed" with the Republicans' use
of immediate effect. He noted
that more than the required
number of representatives have
been calling for roll call votes
on many bills that Republicans

had been passing with immedi-
ate effect.
"I'm glad that the court of
appeals is going to take this
on," Irwin said. "I'm glad that
they're going to the look at the
details of this insidious practice
that the House of Representa-
tives has fallen into."
Irwin added that using
immediate effect for legislation
is a tactic that has been used by
both Republicans and Demo-
crats in the past, but argued that
does not mean its use is justi-
fied.
"If in the past, either Demo-
crats or Republicans ignored
that constitutional provision,
they were wrong to do it then
and they're wrong to do it now,"
Irwin said. "We're just trying
to stand up for what's obviously
right and keep the Republicans
accountable for the people of
the state of Michigan."
Irwin said the use of immedi-
ate effect by the Legislature has
"degenerated" over time.
"Now, in 2012 and 2011,
immediate effect votes we're
just like a reflex," Irwin said.
"It's gotten to the point now
where it's completely routine
and it's completely against the
spirit and the letter of the con-
stitution ... It's never been this
bad."
Irwin, who is in his first term
as representative, added that
claims concerning Democrats'
previous abuse of immediate
effect are irrelevant because
many members of the House
were not members of the ses-
sions that used immediate
effect.
"I've always thought this was
a really insidious and horrible
way to run the Legislature,"
Irwin said. "I've always thought
they should count the votes."

umerous bomb threats target
University of Pittsburgh campus

WANT TO WORK IN THIS OLD
BUILDING THIS SUMMER?

Faculty alter
teaching practices
in wake of scares
PITTSBURGH (AP) - Doz-
ens of bomb threats at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, including
at least four yesterday, have
made professors start holding
classes outside and forced secu-
rity officials to Vut in newbuild-
ing access measures and offer
a $50,000 reward for informa-
tion.
Some students "are definitely
afraid," said Brian Haughwout,
a junior who had one of his final
exams changed to a take-home
because of the disruptions.
"But I think just shutting
down the university would be a
mistake," he said, adding that's
probably what the person mak-
ing the threats wants.
The threats began in mid-
February, at first targeting a
landmark building at the center
of campus. But in recent weeks
numerous buildings have been
threatened. Four threats had
been made by mid-afternoon
Monday, starting at about 4 a.m.
Student Dawn Diehl, who's
studying for a master's degree
in library science, said it wasn't
until a few days ago that the
bomb threats started to affect
her in terms of "my feelings of
security." .

"So now it's pretty alarming,"
she said. "We've never had an
experience like this. I kind of
have that feeling like, where's
this going to end?"
Diehl was surprised yester-
day to find all but one door to
the main library locked and'
everyone's bags being searched.
Under new security mea-
sures, students and faculty
members will need school IDs
to get into buildings. Non-resi-
dents won't be permitted in dor-
mitories.
University police, the FBI
and the U.S. Secret Service
have said they have a person
of interest in the investigation.
Authorities say some of the
threats have been traced to or
through computers in Austria,
but nobody has been charged
with making them.
Fifth-year chemistry student
Brian Graham said the first
threats were written on walls in
buildings and he hoped security
officers would catch the perpe-
trator. But, he said, threats then
started arrivingby email.
"I think it's a little bit more
nerve-racking," Graham said
of the latest Wave of threats. "I
have to either stay later or come
in different hours. I would be
about to leave home, and then
there'd be a bomb threat."
Graham says he's confident
that Pitt officials are doing what
needs to be done to protect

students and find the person
responsible.
"It seems that they're taking
all the appropriate steps," he
said.
The threats have caused
some professors to . move
classes outdoors or offer them
online and have led some stu-
dents to stay off-campus. The
university, located a few miles
from downtown Pittsburgh,
has about 3,800 full-time facul-
ty members who serve 34,000
students.
The university is urging fac-
ulty members to make arrange-
ments for students to make
up classes or exams missed
because of evacuations, but it
says there are no plans to end
the semester early.
No bombs have been found,
and nobody has been injured,
but police say the building evac-
uations will continue if war-
ranted. There have been about
25 threats targeting numerous
buildings, with some of those
threatened multiple times.
U.S. Attorney David Hickton
in Pittsburgh issued a state-
ment Friday commending Pitt's
response and confirming the
threats "are being vigorously,
aggressively and thorough.
investigated through every pos-
sible mean" by the region's Joint
Terrorism Task Force, which
includes the campus police and
the FBI.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

Burke's return brings exciting lineup opportunities

On Monday morning, the
Michigan men's bas-
ketball program found
good fortune for the first time in
weeks.
Just five days after the Wol-
verines fell to Ohio in the second
round of the
NCAA Tour-
nament in -
mid-March,
three players 44.:
announcedR
their plans to
transfer from
the program.
Sophomore LUKE
forward Evan PASCH
Smntrycz,
who was a key
contributor over his first two sea-
sons in Ann Arbor, decided that
he wasn't happy at Michigan.
On April 4, sources reported
that freshman point guard Trey-
Burke was expected to forgo his
sophomore season at Michigan
and enter the NBA Draft. Some
reports seemed credible, but
Michigan coach John Beilein
wrote in a blog post later that day
that the speculation was prema-
ture.
He did not deny that Burke
was leaningtoward the NBA,
though. With no capable point
guard left on the roster, fans
began to brace themselves for
a 2012-13 season without a true
floor general. Beilein and his staff
reached out to unranked, unher-
alded recruit Spike Albrecht last
week and earned his commit-
ment over the weekend.
Then, on Monday morning,
Burke announced that he will
return for a sophomore season,
despite the recent rumors that
said otherwise. In that.moment,
the Wolverines jumped from a ,
potential bubble team to pre-
season Ton 10.

Burke and Hardaway Jr., that
would leave one open position at
the guard/wing position. Expect
incoming freshman Glenn Rob-
inson III to beat out his cohort,
Nick Stauskas, for that starting
role.
Robinson III has lit up recruit-
ing services throughout his
senior season in high school and
was recently rewarded with a No.
18 ranking and five-star rating on
ESPNU's top-100 recruits for the
class of 2012. The kid can attack
the basket with ease, shoot from
long range, and he'll immediately
be one of the most athletic guys
on Beilein's roster.
But it appears that the start-
ing lineup may be a bit devoid of
vocal leadership. Burke tends to
be quiet, leading by example, and
Hardaway Jr. all too often lets his
emotions get the best of him on
the court.
In replacing the senior leader-
ship of co-captains Douglass and
Zack Novak, Beilein may turn to
his bench.
"That's what I want to be - a
leader and captain of this team,"
said junior guard Josh Bartel-
stein, who has played a cumula-
tive 46 minutes over his career.
"I just try to help everyone. I've
already talked to the freshmen
that are coming in just to make
sure they know that we're not
taking any steps back, whether
it's with or without Trey."
Not surprisingly, Beilein
declined to comment on how
exactly he'd fill his leadership
void, notingthat he has all off-
season to let players prove them- ,
selves and make up his mind.
But until then, we'll all do
what we do best - keep speculat-
ing.

at lpasch@umich.edu.

Teams finalizing

deal to play at
Madison Square
Garden on Nov. 24
By MATT SLOVIN
Daily Sports Editor
To conquer the CCHA in its
33rd and final season in the
league, the Michigan hockey
team will need to go through
defending conference cham-
pion Ferris
State - four NOTEBOOK
times. A CCHA
source confirmed Monday that
the Bulldogs will be a part of
the Wolverines' "pod," or group
of CCHA teams that play four
times instead of the usual two.
Ferris State is coming off
unprecedented runs to the
CCHA regular-season crown
and the national title game. Bos-
ton College finally put a stop to
the best season in Ferris State
history on Saturday night with a
4-1 win in the NCAA champion-
ship game.
Michigan managed a sweep
of the Bulldogs in the two teams'
lone series during the 201-12
season. The October meetings
saw the Wolverines dominate
Ferris State, posting a 9-2 vic-
tory in the aggregate.
The defending national
runner-up won't be the only
difficult foe in the pod, how-
ever. Joining Ferris State will be
Western Michigan, Notre Dame
and perennial pod mate Michi-
gan State.
All but the Fighting Irish
finished in the league's top-five
teams this season, though that's
hardly to say Notre Dame wasn't
formidable. Michigan split the
series in South Bend, before
needing a double-overtime
thriller to help sweep the Irish
in the CCHA quarterfinals at

Josh Furman
suspended amid
legal trouble

Michigan safety
will go on trial on
April 23 with three
charges against him
By STEPHEN J. NESBITT
Daily Sports Editor
Josh Furman has been sus-
pended from the Michigan foot-
ball program after the coaching
staff learned of a trio of charges
being brought against the red-
shirt sophomore safety.
According to court records,
Furman has been charged with
three offenses - domestic vio-
lence, assault, and breaking and
entering - that occurred in the

football program.
The court records show the
location of the offenses as 600 E.
Madison Street - better known
as South Quad.
As first reported by Sam Webb
of GoBlueWolverine.com and
later elaborated on by the Detroit
Free Press, Furman was in a
dorm room with two women and
received a threatening text from
another male.
"Mr. Furman got up and they
thought he was going to try to
find the man so the two females
jumped on him," Furman's attor-
ney, Gerry Mason, told the Free
Press. "The only person injured
was Mr. Furman, who had a
dreadlock pulled out ofhishead."
Furman has since shaved his
head. And Mason expects that a

Western Michigan and Mich-
igan State joined Michigan and
Ferris State in this year's NCAA
Tournament field of 16. How-
ever, both the Broncos and Spar-
tans were pitted against No. 1
seeds and suffered first-round
exits, just like the Wolverines
did despite their top seeding.
During the 2011-12 season,
the Wolverines were a combined
9-3-1 against the three teams
they will play four times in
their CCHA swan song. Michi-
gan will depart for the Big Ten
Hockey Conference following
next season.
The entirety of Michigan's
schedule has not yet been
released.

BIG RED REMATCH: Just
over two weeks after Cornell
knocked Michigan out of the
NCAA Tournament, the Cornell
athletic department is just a few
formalities short of announcing
another meeting.
Instead of a sparsely popu-
lated Resch Center in Green
Bay, Wisc., where the Big Red
ended the Wolverines'season in
March, the game is slated to be
played at New York City's Madi-
son Square Garden.
Though Cornell has yet to
sign a finalized agreement with
the venue, sources tell the Daily
that the game will likely be
played on Nov. 24, the Saturday
following Thanksgiving. The
game will potentially conflict

with the Michigan-Ohio State
football game, scheduled for the
same day in Columbus.
NOTE: Bowling Green offi-
cially released its 2012-13 sched-
ule on Monday. According to
BowlingGreen Sentinel-Tribune
writer Kevin Gordon's Twitter
account, Michigan will play two
midweek games against the Fal-
cons. One of the midweek affairs
will take place on Nov. 21, with
the second meeting scheduled
for Jan. 8, 2013.
The two teams were origi-
nally slated to play a series on
Thanksgiving weekend, but a
change was needed to accom-
modate the Wolverines' date
with Cornell at Madison Square
Garden.

overall) today
and Toledo (4-5,13-18) tomorrow,
both of which look like plausible
wins for the Wolverines. But the
outcome will depend on two of
Maloney's decisions.
Decision 1: Starting pitcher
The day before every midweek
contest, Maloney asks himself
who will start on the mound, and
there's rarely a definitive answer.
Consideringthe pitchingstaff's
lack of reliability, Maloney has
little to choose from. While some
of the young hurlers have begun
to step up recently, others have
fallen short of expectations.
Though junior right-hander
BenBallantine andredshirtjunior
left-hander Bobby Brosnahan
started the season with promising
production, they have stumbled to
find their footing as of late.
On March 21, pitching coach
Steve Merriman praised Brosna-
han, Ballantine and senior right-
hander Brandon Sinnery, butwith
a caveat. His words were foretell-
ing.
"Nothing has been etched in
stone," Merriman said. "Those
guys are competing, they're all
competing for that opportunity.
And you know what? That could
change two weeks into the Big
Ten season."
Brosnahan's inconsistency per-
suaded Maloney to start fresh-
man left-hander Trent Szkutnik
and replace him with sophomore
right-hander Alex Lakatos - two

PAUL SHERMAN/Daily
Junior pitcher Ben Ballantine will start against Toledo on Wednesday.

youngpitcherswho have emerged
from the struggling bullpen -
against Michigan State on Sat-
urday. Earlier this season, they
seemed like probable candidates
for midweek starts. But their
combined 142 pitches render
them unavailable for the upcom-
ing contests. In Ballantine's last
two starts against Minnesota and
Michigan State, he gave up five
earned runs, eight hits and four
walks in just 3.2 innings of work.
After pulling Ballantine off
the mound, Maloney had to
rotate through four relievers,
including freshman right-hand-
er Matt Ogden, who threw for
five innings. Last weekend put
a noticeable dent in the list of
prospective midweek pitchers.
So Maloney will start freshman
right-hander James Bourque
today against Bowling Green and
give Ballantine another opportu-
nity to redeem himself in tomor-
row's start against Toledo.
Bourque earned a 7-3 win last
week against Central Michigan
with three strikeouts in three
innings, giving up only one
earned run. But Ballantine has to
show Maloney he deserves anoth-
er chance.
Decision 2: Batting order
It seems that Maloney has
finally found something that
works - freshman shortstop
Dylan Delaney in the two-hole.
Delaney was always placed

in the eighth or ninth spot of
the batting order. But last week-
end, Maloney bumped him up in
the lineup, and he notched five
hits, three RBIs and a home run
against the Spartans.
Though Michigan lost sopho-
more right fielder Michael O'Neill
to a left-hand injury, a number of
unlikely players stepped up at the
right time. Maloney had to use
freshman Zach Zott, who entered
the Michigan State series with a
.179 batting average, in right field
to compensate for the loss in the
lineup. He went 3-for-9 with two
runs and three RBIs.
It is unclear if Maloney will
continue experimenting with the
batting order. But before he posts
the starting lineup, he'll need to
take a few things into account.
Bowling Green has eight play-
ers batting above .300, led by
outfielder Andrew Kubuski's
.389 average on 44 hits. But since
the Falcon pitching staff posts a
mediocre 4.63 ERA, the matchup
is bound to be an offensive show.
Toledo has just one consistent
starter batting above .300 and
lingers at the bottom of the MAC
in all facets of the game. Though
the Rockets appear to be an easy
win for the Wolverines, it will all
depend on Maloney's decisions.
"We just haveto make sure we
play to the same level that we play
higher teams," Delaney said. "We
can't take them lightly."

installment
in the "Men

franchise.
Over the
years, I've

on sequels.
There are
certain sequels that far surpass
the originals - "Back to the
Future Part II," "Indiana Jones
and the Last Crusade," "Star
Wars: Episode V - The Empire
Strikes Back." But these are
generally the exceptions rather
than the norms. For the most
part, we don't like it when studios
rehash the same tried formulas
just to make some easy cash on
a franchise they know will sell.
We like "Iron Man." They give
us a sequel. We like "Captain
America" and "Thor" and "The
Incredible Hulk." Theygive us
the upcoming "The Avengers."
Could it be entertaining? Possibly.
Is it also possible it will be a cata-
strophic mess along the lines of
"Spider-Man 3"? Without a doubt.
So, I was understandably more
than a little hesitant when I first
heard they were making yet
another "Men in Black" movie.
And then I looked over the bigger
films scheduled to hit theaters
in the summer of 2012: There's
the new James Bond movie; Zack
Snyder's Superman reboot, aptly
titled "Man of Steel"; and, of
course, the return of everyone's
favorite web crawler, "The Amaz-
ing Spider-Man."
In some ways, it's the sum-

procures improv wiz

tonight to play From $10
at the Michigan
League Ballroom.
Of course, Bradford Cox - the
musical mastermind behind Atlas
Sound and frontman of Deer-
hunter - doesn't usually torture
his audience members. While
most of his tracks are about four
minutes long, Atlas Sound likes
to improvise on stage, loop-
ing melodies and choruses that
extend songs into shape-shifting
creations that can only be experi-
enced live. For his show tonight,
Cox will likely stick to tracks off
his 2011 album Parallax along
with some old favorites, and he
will hopefully engage in some
Youtube-worthy mid-show ban-
ter with the crowd. But whether
he's playing a 15-minute version
of "Walkabout" or donning a ski
mask and commanding audi-
ence members to strip (he's done
that), Atlas Sound aims to create a
vibrant show.
The group responsible for this
event is New Beat Happening, a
student organization that books

featured such acts as Broken

student votes at the NBH Battle
of the Bands, and he spoke in a
recent interview about his oppor-
tunity to play with Atlas Sound.
"I am definitely excited for this
next show. It's sort of like my final
exam for fthrsn's school year,"
Underdown said. "I'd say Atlas
Sound is the most widely known
act I've played with."
Underdown also offered a pre-

good things about Peter Wiley.
I've gotten to know him a lot over

ALBUM REVIEW
Ward marries opposites*

By GEOFF MARINO
Daily Arts Writer
In a recent interview with
About.com, M. Ward expressed
the need for art that somehow
incorporates
opposites: "I'm
of the opinion
that all good M. Ward
pieces of art
... have some A Wasteland
sort of inter- Companion
esting contrast
between dark Merge
and light." This
philosophy is
well-executed in A Wasteland
Companion, as M. Ward mixes
his characteristic sensitive tones
with more energetic blues. He
departs from his comfort zone
by engaging the two polarities
but still maintains the comfort-
able sound that his voice and
acoustic guitar are known to
produce.
In addition to an active solo
career, M. Ward is part of She
& Him with Zooey Deschanel,
and a super-group - consisting
of Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis
of Bright Eyes, and Jim James
of My Morning Jacket - called
Monsters of Folk. He has also
teamed up with singers Beth
Orton, Cat Power, Neko Case and
Jenny Lewis.
Obviously, collaboration
with other artists is an integral
part of his creative process. His
record suggests a remarkable
level of assertiveness to work
with others.
And yet, M. Ward has always
had a reputation for shyness. At
his live performances, he usual-
ly has a cap or sunglasses pulled
over his eyes, suggesting that
he is a more withdrawn type
of songwriter. Ward embodies
opposites in the same way thatA
Wasteland Companion does.
The bluesy "Sweetheart"
is a fascinating example of
this. Zooey Deschanel makes
a cameo appearance, and her
voice sounds alot like one of the
Ronettes, suggesting that M.
Ward is experimenting with Phil
Spector's revolutionary record-
ing technique first employed in
