IM Building, South
Campus facility
to receive $118.7
million investment
By CLAIRE BRYAN
Daily StaffReporter
From varsity rowers to intra-
mural racquetball fanatics, stu-
dent-athletes are in luck.
Thursday, the University's
Board of Regents approved $18.7
million in renovations to the
Intramural Sports Building and
the construction of a $168 million
South Campus athletics facility -
one of the largest sports-focused
construction projects in decades.
The athletic campus proposal,
called the Athletics South Com-
petition and Performance Project,
is funded in part by a $200 million
gift by real estate tycoon Stephen
Ross, a University alum. The $200
million was.split evenly between
the Athletic Department and

Ross' namesake business school
and followed his first $100 million
donation to the school in 2004.
Plans for the athletic - facili-
ties call for the construction
of a 310,000 square-foot facil-
ity designed to serve student-
athletes, including participants in
men and women's track and field,
cross country, soccer, lacrosse,
wrestling, tennis, gymnastics and
women's rowing teams.
"What I appreciate about the
proposal is the holistic approach
that it takes," University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel said. "It
allows us to address a number
of important needs across these
teams simultaneously."
According to Douglas Strong,
interim executive vice presi-
dent and chief financial officer,
the project will construct five
facilities including an indoor
and outdoor track venue that
will accommodate 2,000 and
1,000 students respectively and a
lacrosse stadium slated to accom-
modate 3,000 spectators.

* Feminist activists
famous for protests
against Putin
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily News Editor
Students and Ann Arborites
lined East Liberty Street Thurs-
day night to see two members
from Pussy Riot, a Russian punk

rock protest group that's made
international headlines since
their 2011 inception.
Dressed in A-line skirts,
tights and lace-up sneakers,
Nadezhda (Nadya) Tolokon-
nikova and Maria (Masha)
Alyokhina did not look so dif-
ferent from their undergraduate
audience - a few of whom wore
the neon balaclavas that Pussy
Riot members typically don.
Interarts junior Daniel Ghas-

tin was one such balaclavaed
student, who said he and other
performance arts students
came to show solidarity for
Pussy Riot.
"As performers, we want to
understand what they do bet-
ter and a form of imitation is the
greatest compliment," Ghas-
tin said. "I am really curious in
what makes them tick and how
they formulate what they do,
but also I really admire the balls

that they have."
Before entering the theater,
one performance art student
mimicked a Pussy Riot dance
while two others filmed him.
Attendees packed the 1,700-
seat Michigan Theater, where
punk rock music played in
the background as they found
their seats. Tolokonnikova
and Alyokhina were not there
to play their own music, but

Admissions office

Thisfall,the Universityenrolled

307 over last year - and about 500

more than University officials had
intended.
At Thursday's meeting of the
Board of Regents, University Pro-
vost Martha Pollack detailed sev-
eral steps the Office of Admissions
plans to take to reduce the size of
future classes - including shifting
more early applicants to a wait list.
She also outlined the University's
plans to handle this larger-than-
expected freshman class.

"We have been over-enrolling
every year for the past five years
and we have to stop this," Pollack
said. "I'm notchappy about it."
This year, the University
received a record-breaking 49,731

Republican
incumbent hopes
to keep seat for
second term
By SHOHAM GEVA
Daily StaffReporter
Attorney General Bill
Schuette (R) will ask Michi-
gan's voters to elect him to a
second term this November.
Running on the slogan
"Michigan's voice for victims,"
over the past three years,
Schuette has been involved in

issues affecting a variety of
constituencies, ranging from
college students to Detroit
pensioners. As his campaign
ramps up, he's picked up
endorsements from several
groups, including police offi-
cers and small businesses. His
Democratic challenger is Mark
Totten, a Michigan State Uni-
versity law professor.
Gay marriage
In March, a district court
struck down Michigan's ban
on, same-sex marriage, which
was approved by voters as an
amendment to the state consti-
tution in 2004.
Schuette, who represented

the state in defense of the ban,
filed for an appeal and an emer-
gency stayon the decision. Both
were granted, which means the
change will not go into effect
until the appeal is settled. Oral
arguments were heard in the
case this August by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the 6th.
Circuit.
Schuette's decision to defend
the ban drew attention because
many other state attorney gen-
erals, especially in the wake of
a 2013 Supreme Court decision
against parts of the Defense of
Marriage Act, have declined to
defend similar litigation. Addi-
tionally, U.S. Attorney Gen-

eral Eric Holder has stated that
state attorney generals are not
required to defend the bans.
"In 2004 the citizens of
Michigan recognized that
diversity in parenting is best
for kids and families because
moms and dads are not inter-
changeable," Schuette said in a
March statement on his choice
to appeal the ruling. "Michigan
voters enshrined that decision
in our State constitution, and
their will should stand and be
respected."

Groove: making a unique ruckus

I just opened another tab on my laptop to
search for the list. Yes, the list that all of cam-
pus has been talking about. The new univer-
sity rankings have just come out. Most would
assume that I am referencing the latest U.S.
News and World Report published college
rankings (with their highly questioned meth-
odology), where the University unfortunately
continues to trickle lower and lower. While
more concentrated efforts must be taken to
ensure that we as a university push the needle
in the opposite direction, I am actually allud-
ing to the new college football poll released this
week by the Associated Press. A storied foot-
ball program like Michigan should consistently
be in the top 10 and not at number 13. Oh, I'm
sorry, the Wolverine in me saw "Michigan" and
assumed that it was us. That spot has already
been taken by the green people in Lansing -
our rivals, Michigan State.
I continue to scroll down the page, aimlessly
looking for the maize and blue, knowing damn
well we're not there. I scroll back up and go
down the list again, probing for any pattern that
might exist in the universities that are ahead
of us that might provide us with something to
emulate and provide me with an excuse to tell
my friend at the University of Notre Dame,
explaining why we didn't put up a single point
against them two weekends ago in South Bend.
I continue to scan the page, examining what I
see and come to this conclusion: The schools
that make up this list don't have tough, robust
academic programs like the University of
Michigan. This lame cop-out was short-lived
when I went over the list again and noticed the
University of Notre Dame; University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles; Stanford University and
the University of Southern California. These
schools are ranked 16, 23, 4 and 25, respectively,
in this year's aforementioned U.S. News rank-
ings. The University of Michigan is ranked 29.
For the better part of the last decade, seeing
auniversity known for its academic prowess in
the AP Top 25 was a rarity. Now an institution
like Stanford - which pumps out tech CEOs

faster than their alum Richard Sherman can
open his mouth -is sitting pretty in college
football paradise, consistently competing for
National Championships. With Michigan also
being an academic world power, what is hold-
ing us back from reclaiming our glory on the
gridiron while continuingto study our tails off?
It starts and ends with recruiting. Our col-
lege football program must look itself in the
mirror and realize that we aren't a stereotypi-
cal SEC school that:doesn't care about academ-
ics. At our very core, we are aresearch-oriented
school and an authority in the world of aca-
demia. This shouldn't be something we should
run away from. We should gladly embrace this.
Contrary to popular belief, strong academ-
ics will not deter quality student-athletes
from attending the University. And let's face
it, Michigan's academic standards are hard
for any high school student to meet, let alone
those who devote a large amount of time to
athletics. Although this definitely limits the
amount of talent that will be scouted, this
will not necessarily limit the quality of talent.
There is an article in The Wall Street Journal
by Darren Everson and Jared Diamond on
Stanford's recruiting methodology. Wayne
Lyons, a highly rated recruit from Florida
with a 4.96 weighted GPA who was recruited
by the top programs in the country but ulti-
mately chose the Cardinal, said, "Stanford
made the academics a huge priority." Stanford
University is the only school to be ranked in
the top five in U.S. News rankings and the
AP Top 25 concurrently. Michigan football
must use the University to their advantage
and find leaders in the classroom, as well as
the field. Success can and will be found when
this happens. The program shouldn't try to fit
in with some of the less academically inclined
schools. Michigan football should try to stand
out as aprogram where you will pushyourself
further than you thought you could go and
you will be glad you did.

You've heard them banging

how a relatively
small group of
people could
make such a
unique ruckus.
Groove has'

campus with an SHAMASKIN

of entertainment
by hitting drums and homemade
instruments. Simply described'
as a "high energy percussion and
performance group," Groove has
made a statement on our campus.
I had the opportunity to talk with
Groove treasurer John Mirandette,
an LSA junior with an international
studies major and sustainability
minor;in order to get more insight
into this group of drummers. I
wanted to see the inner workings,
how a member began and grew and
what Groove itself is like as a whole.
When John first came to
Michigan, he had plans other than
joining Groove. "I thought about
being in marching band and drum
line, but I hated marching band
in high school. I had to follow
instructions to the tee and be rigid;
I couldn't do what I wanted to do,
I couldn't have fun with it." After
finding Groove at Festifall during
his freshman year, he could tell this
was it: "It was already something I
was good at, so it was easy for me
to dive in." John always found that
he was uncomfortable playing in
front of groups of people when it
was songs about which he himself
was not passionate. As opposed to
the "cheesy and corny" songs that
were typically reserved for high
school bands, John found that he

could explore in Groove, making the common denominator is

tinued well beyond that change.
Additionally, more admitted
students are choosing to actually
enroll at the University at a time
when officials are actively plan-
ning to shrink the freshman class.
The University admits more stu-
dents than it can enroll, anticipat-
ing some of those applicants will
ultimately select other schools -
a standard practice in higher edu-
cation admissions.
The proportion of applicants
admitted who actually enroll is
called an institution's "yield."
This year, the yield for fresh-
man applicants increased by 1.3
percent for in-state students and
two percent for out-of-state stu-
dents.
"In a sense, there's a bit of
good news, but of course, there's
bad news because this isn't what
we had planned," Pollack said.
SCHUETTE
From Page 1A
11,000 rape kits - evidence col-
lected during investigations of
alleged sexual assault - that had
not been processed or tested.
Schuette, along with Republi-
can Gov. Rick Snyder, announced
a $4 million state appropriation to
expedite testing the kits last year.
The funding came from settle-
ment money in national and state
cases litigated by Schuette in his
capacity as attorney general.
"Every woman who was a vic-
tim of sexual violence deserves
a full and complete investiga-
tion, and these funds will begin
the road to justice for those who
have already waited too long,"
Schuette said in a press release at
the time.
An additional $3 million allo-
cation was approved in the fiscal
year 2015 budget for the attor-
ney general's office to prosecute

Pollack said the University's
Office of Admissions would con-
sider placing more early appli-
cants on the wait list and offer
comparatively fewer early admis-
sions.
"We're goingto set a targetthat
is well below actual and we're
going to make very intentional
use of the wait list," she said.
Pollack added that she's
working with the University's
new vice president of enroll-
ment management, whom the
regents appointed in June,
to implement more advanced
prediction tools for modeling
enrollment figures. -
The target freshman enroll-
ment number will require
approval of the provost and the
office of Admissions will also
have to clear any adjustments
to the target with Pollack.
"I feel pretty comfortable that
we won't be in this situation next
year," she said.
Officials are also working
with colleges and schools to

ensure the University can pro-
vide a high-quality undergradu-
ate education for this year's
larger freshman class over their
next four years.
LSA added 41 class sections
this fall and plans to add an addi-
tional 45 for the winter semester,
mostly in popular core subject
areas such as Spanish, math-
ematics and economics. The Col-
lege of Engineering has hired
new instructors to teach addi-
tional discussion sections for the
college's key first-year courses.
On top of the accommodations
that have already been made,
Pollack said the University is
increasing funding by 10 percent
for the faculty expansion pro-
gram included in the fiscal year
2015 budget that was designed to
keep class sizes small. Those fac-
ulty will be hired this year and
arrive on campus next fall.
Housing was also a primary
concern for administrators, since
more than 97 percent of fresh-
men live on-campus and West

Quad Residence Hall remains
closed as it undergoes a massive
renovation project. To cope with
a shortage of housing, the Uni-
versity incentivized returning
students with University Hous-
ing contracts to seek off-campus
accommodations. More than
330 of those students ultimately
signed off-campus leases - free-
ing space for the larger freshman
class. When West Quad reopens
next fall, it will mark the first
time in eight years that none of
the University's major housing
facilities are closed for renova-
tion.
Despite the University's fail-
ure to meet enrollment targets,
Pollack assured the board that
this year's influx of freshmen
won't impact the student expe-
rience. In 2010, the University
enrolled a similarly large fresh-
man class without a noticeable
dip in retention.
"I don't want to leave the
impression that it's more of a
disaster than it is," she said.


TOTTEN.
From Page 1A
A native Michigander and resi-
dent of Kalamazoo, Totten has
been on the law faculty at Michi-
gan State University since 2008,
and for three years served con-
currently as a federal prosecutor
in the U.S. Attorney's Office for
the Western District of Michi-
gan. Totten feels that incumbent
Bill Schuette has used the office.
to "wage a series of extreme cru-
sades that have left every family
and everystudent inthis state less
safe." He believes the attorney
general's role is to be "the people's
lawyer," and has positioned him-
self on the issues through that
lens. Here are five major issues
Mark Totten wants to focus on.
Violent crime
Totten wants to reemphasize
effortsto protect people from vio-
lent crime, whether at the hands
of armed criminals or domestic
abusers and sexual assailants. In
addition to advocating for sur-
vivors, Totten wants to protect
public education funding from
further cuts and expand prisoner
reentry programs as a means of
crime prevention.
Economic crime'
Aside from violent crime, Tot-
ten believes the attorney general
must do a better job protecting
people from economic crimes as
well. Michigan was one of the
states hardest-hit during the
housing crisis, as many families
fell victim to predatory lending
schemes that often resulted in
home foreclosure. In an inter-
view with the Daily, Totten said
he believes Schuette has not done
enough to hold lenders account-
able or assist citizens affected by
the crisis.
Strengthening Consumer Pro-
tection and ending drug immu-
nity
Somewhat related to economic
crime protection are Michigan's
consumer protection laws, which
Totten characterized as some of
the weakest in the nation, as they

are filled with exemptions for
businesses that would normally
be compelled to comply with the
regulations. In addition to tight-
ening protections for consumers
in a variety of transactional areas,
Totten also wants to end Michi-
gan's drug immunity law.
"We're the only state in the
nation that says if you are harmed
or killed by a prescription drug
you are helpless to do anything
about it," he said in a statement.
Women's issues
If elected, Totten said he would
use his office to better protect
women's interests, such as ensur-
ing access to contraception. He
has accused Schuette of being
the most active Attorney General
on behalf of Hobby Lobby, which
argued that corporations should
not be required to provide insur-
ance policies that cover the pur-
chase of contraceptives.
Studentloans
Totten is concerned with the
amountofdebtthatstudentsaccrue
by the time they graduate college,
and said part of the problem stems
from lenders and loan servicers
acting in bad faith. He said pri-
vate lenders "try to steer students
into products that are much more
expensive when the student other-
wise might have qualified for sub-
sidized loans in the first instance."
As Attorney General, Totten said
he would be active in fighting these
groups in court.
Though he is 40 years old, Tot-
ten said he felt this was the right
time to run for this office because
he was concerned with the direc-
tion the office was taking. He said
the job is so important because
most people - even those in the
middle class - cannot afford law-
yers of their own.
"When there are harms that
affect thousands of people across
the state, they really depend upon
the Attorney General who is act-
ing as their lawyer," he said. "I
don't think that mission is being
fulfilled now."
With just under seven weeks
until election day, a Detroit News
poll has Schuette leading Totten
40-38 among decided voters.

cases related to the kits.
Healthcare
Schuette announced this Feb-
ruary that he, along with several
other state attorney generals,
joined a federal lawsuit against
a provision in the Affordable
Care Act. Schuette supported the
plaintiffs in the suit, a group of
individuals and small businesses.
The case hinges on whether
states with healthcare exchanges
set up by the federal government,
as is the case in Michigan and 33
other states, are eligible for fed-
eral tax credits to subsidize the
cost of healthcare for individuals
with financial need.
The ACA includes language
meant to incentivize states to set
up their own exchanges by offer-
ing the tax credits specifically to
state-run exchanges.
The case is currently before
the D.C. Court of Appeals. With-
out the financial support from
the credits, a large number of
individuals could feasibly opt out
of the ACA's individual mandate

requirement for coverage.
Affirmative action
In 2012, Schuette faced a legal
challenge to another state ban,
this one on affirmative action,
approved by the voters in 2006
and prompted by a previous case
against the University's admis-
sions practices.
In Schuette v. Coalition to
Defend Affirmative Action,
the U.S. Supreme Court upheld
the ban earlier this year, after
Schuette appealed a decision by
the 6th Circuit Court to over-
turn it. In his original petition
to the Supreme Court asking
for a review of the 6th Circuit
decision, Schuette cited issues
of unequal treatment, which he
argued affirmative action pro-
moted. The state's argument has
received both criticism and sup-
port in the University communi-
ty over the past eight years - and
raised questions of voter disen-
franchisement and protection of
the state constitution, similar to
the gay marriage ban.

Pensioners
Schuette filed to intervene in
the deliberations on behalf of
the city's pensioners, a signifi-
cant group of the city's creditors,
during the June 2013 bankruptcy
settlement case in Detroit.
lie argued that the pension-
ers, who at points in the proceed-
ings were projected to receive
only 66 percent to 95.5 percent
of their pensions had a right to
their pensions under the state's
constitution. This position was
not shared by Detroit Emergency
Manager Kevyn Orr in the city's
original plans to move out of
bankruptcy.
For his actions to protect civil
service pensions, Schuette was
endorsed by the Retired Detroit
Police and Fire Fighters Associa-
tion Tuesday.
"We endorse Bill Schuette for
reelection because he fought for
us, and our pensions, when no
one else did," RDPFFA President
Donald Taylor said in a state-
ment.


PUSSYRIOT
From Page 2A
Alyokhina said having a lawyer
was crucial to her sanity during her
21-month prison stay.
"No other people realize what
it means to have a lawyer in pris-
on," Alyokhina said. "It is the thin
thread that is your communication
to the outside world. He brought me
some newspapers and I read them.
Then, I realized that the past few
days, there had been this weird fog
around me which had been nothing
but people in green uniform. There
was a big world of events out there.
That was always a big surprise."
Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova
said their prosecution highlighted
the poor status of women in Russia
and the shortcomings of what they
see as a broken legal system. Femi-
nism was considered a bad word to
say in the church, and the fact that
the young women are mothers was
emphasized.
"We are bad because we do stuff
like this," Alyokhina said, "instead
of sitting at home cooking soup."

ATHLETICS
From Page 1A
These venues will allow
the University to host local,
regional and national competi-
tions.
Engineering senior Amber
Smith, a two-time captain of
the women's track and field
team, expressed the need for a
space her team can gather and
build a community.
"What I want for this Uni-
versity is to have its athletes
brighten up when they see fel-
low students and families able
to cheer them on at Michigan,"
Smith said. "It will create a
stronger and more commit-
ted fan base, better moral and
greater alumni network."
Strong also noted the new
facility will also be available
to the student body at large for
events and special occasions.
Regent Mark Bernstein (D)
and Schlissel voiced the impor-
tance of ensuring the facilities
are available for every student

on campus.
"I'm pleased that this pro-
posal centers around enhanc-
ing the student experience,"
Schlissel said.
The regents also approved
a proposal to renovate the
aging Intramural Sports Build-
ing. When it opened in 1928,
the iconic Intramural Sports
Building was the first facility
at an institution of higher edu-
cation dedicated primarily to
intramural sports.
The $18.7 million project is
one of multiple upgrades fund-
ed by the Student Life Student
Fee for Facility Renewal initi-
ate.
In April 2013, the regents
voted to administer a-$65 per-
term student fee to fund reno-
vations of campus unions and
recreational sports facilities.
"The IM Building is an
important center for health
recognition and social inter-
action," said E. Royster Harp-
er, vice president of student
life. "The building serves over
one million student (visits)
per year."

The project will reconfig-
ure existing space to create
new exerciserooms, locker
rooms, a larger cardio work-
out area, improved racquet-
ball courts and staff offices. It
will also improve mechanical,
electrical and plumbing work;
lighting improvement and
gymnasium floor replacement
work.
During the public com-
ments portion of the meeting,
LSA senior Jacob Light, chair
of Buildinga Better Michigan,
a group which spearheaded
efforts to update the Universi-
ty's public recreation spaces,
thanked the regents for their
continued support of these
projects.
"Students expect that their
sacrifice of a large portion of
gym space and financial bur-
den born unto them will bring
rewards in the future," Light
said. "We renovate these spac-
es to ensure that high quality
facilities are open for and invit-
ing to all students; irrespective
of race, gender, ability or socio-
economic status."

"In his country there is a ten-

very boring - theater, and it's
very different in Germany," Shier
said. "When you go to see a per-

dents that it doesn't matter what.

and non-German-speaking guests
alike for an open workshop with
Tanz Tangente, a Berlin-based
dance company, that specializes
in community engagement and
working with amateur dance stu-
dents.
This event concludes the triad
of events put on the past couple of
weeks by the RC called' "Remem-
ber Me," which also included a
concert by Professor Michael.

Gould, featuring the poetry of RC
poetry professorKen Mikolowski.
Four dancers from the com-
pany and its choreographer,
Nadja Raszewski, have been
working with the RC's intensive
German students in a two-week
residency, which culminates on
Sept. 19 with the open workshop.

There, students will be working
with and "translating" into dance
and movement a pair of texts by
Ulrike Meinhof, German militant
and journalist, and Elias Canetti,
Bulgarian-born German-language
writer.
"What we try to do is not to
bring out the text in a kind of pan-
tomime, not describe what we just
read, but to associate by move-
ment," Raszewski said. "It means
that what you can see as a public,'
what you can feel, what you can
experience while you see the com-
position - you can make up your
ownworld. So it's not, 'This is what
you should see."'
The notion that dance or theater
trades in "ideas and associations,"
according to Raszewski, rather
than straightforward images, radi-
cally alters the representational
possibilities of a performance. This
dramatic practice emphasizes
more than others the centrality of
the body in theater.
"For my students, even in Ger-
man Theater, we try to get out
of the situation where everyone
resides 99 percent of the time
between here and here (pointing
to her head), since it's so impor-
tant to involve and understand the
body, and ultimately to understand
language," Shier said.
While it may be beyond the
means of most to travel to Berlin
for the express purpose of seeing
plays, this workshop presents an
opportunity for American stu-
dents to upset many of the norms
and standard practices in theater,
internalized by so many, through
the expert guidance of Shier and
the members of Tanz Tangente.

Daily Arts Writer
When I first started "Z
Nation," SyFy's entrance into
the "Walking Dead" zombie
market, I wasn't sure if I was
watching the latest version of
some "Halo" game or an actual
TV show, Which makes sense,
seeing as it is produced by Asy-
lum Studios, which is respon-
sible for the 'unapologetically
campy "Sharknado" franchise.
Despite these roots and the low
production value, "Z Nation" is
not what Susan Sontag joyfully
called thing as pure artifice.
There is a lot hiding beneath
the much-hyped zombie genre.
Monster genre seems as if it
is constantly fighting an uphill
battle with viewers' respect.
And for some greater reason,
the zombie genre carries more
reflexive disdain than the vam-
pire or supernatural ones. Why
is that? Part of it must be brand-
ing, and the vampire genre has
managed to subvert audience
expectations with shows like
"True Blood" which, at least
initially, changed the direction
from a traditionally singular
study to a social allegory. But
also, the vampire is a human (a
super human, really). Thus, the
vampire accepts individuation,
its monster-ness not subsum-
ing its human-ness. The zom-
bie, on the other hand, resists
that individuation. Its mind-
and therefore its ability for
characterization-is destroyed.
The fear of the zombie is root-
ed in its physical rather than
its psychological menace. Thus
the zombie mob. While vam-
pire genre is man vs. super
man, zombie genre is man vs.
environment.
There must also be teem-
ing social forces that are
unearthed by various itera-
tions of horror. With the
vampire genre, we see youth-
obsession take an immortal
form that would make even the
Kardashians jealous; the ugly
aspects of eternal beauty sym-
bolized by a parasitic depen-
dence on other's lifeblood.
After all, a beautiful surface
lives off the penetrating gaze
of the other, if not some shard
of that reflected identity. Guy
Debord described the recipro-
cal nature of havingvs. defining

beauty in his essay," Society of
the Spectacle." This is also why

belongs to a dark class of celeb-
rity amid an average world. As
much as it is feared, the vam-
pire is an aspirational figure.
On the other hand, the zom-
bie genre manifests the deep-
set fears of society imploding
on itself. It's similar to the
primordial chill of books like
"Lord of the Flies" and "Heart.
of Darkness," except with the
added layer of uncanny famil-
iarity. In the zombie genre, the
zombie mob isn't some unified
structure; instead it's a barely
contained throng of automa-
tons. Three years past the
Occupy Wall Street chaos (both
inside and out), along with the
well-documented low party
identification of young people
and the surge of breathless
coverage following libertari-
anism's newfound trendiness,
one can read the zombie mob
as Baby Boomer's nightmare
fantasy of Gen Y-ers. Espe-
cially since the narrative of
the zombie genre always rests
in the perspective of uninfect-
ed "sane." Anytime sanity is
labeled by perspective of nar-
rative, there's an ideological
mechanism in place organizing
sanity and insanity.
In denying the mob perspec-
tive (save for exceptions like
Isaac Marion's genre-resisting
novel "Warm Bodies"), we also
miss what could be a vehicle for
some fascinating pondering on
a wide range of philosophical
themes - things like the mind-
body connection or the nature
of simulacra, at the very least.
But I digress, the traditional
zombie plot is represented par
excellence in "Z Nation," i.e.
the plot of survival in a world
where reassuring social order
has collapsed. Though predict-
able, the zombie plot is well
equipped to poke at questions
of the public sphere, whether

it's aware of this fact or not..
For example, in the first scene
of "Z Nation," under flickering
lights, three convicts are read
a hastily-passed order that
waives tester consent for test-
ing new drugs. It's arguably
the most horrifying part of the
episode and provides the half-
monster, half-human who
survives the antidote without
turning into a zombie (unlike
the two others). He's the
unlikely savior of America's
future, abandoned by the gov-
ernment until his body serves
some utility.
Deeper analysis of the seem-
ingly banal reveals much. Can
you watch "Z Nation" for its
video-game style gore and
bombard of nonstop action?
Sure, but it's almost more fun
'to look beneath that and probe
at the plight of the Living Dead.

whom I give credit anyway).
Wilde's photo illustrates a
modern Madonna - her face

even her breasts sans stretch

What purpose does this
humble-brag serve? What is
the cost that one of the few
public representations of new

- she's said that the material on
1989 covers a wider range of sub-
jects like her friendships with
other females, family and grow-
ing up - she's now a maturing
pop star capable of real growth
and exploration.
If 1989 ends up being the
album that I and many others
expect it to be, then gone will be
the days of the country duds that
Taylor Swift used as fillers on Red
and we'll finally be ushered into
an era in which she can deliver
the properly well-rounded pop
album we all knew she was capa-
ble of giving us.
Country music and T-Swift are
never ever getting back together.
Like, ever.

At 10 years old, there was no
feeling that could rival the excite-

my contraband issue of TV Guide

a colored marker from my back-

pizza place. Oh, yeah, they're still
doingthat.
Though cable has more street
cred (and cursing, beheadings and
boobs), network TV is still impor-
tant. Not only are its ratings con-
sistently higher than those of its
cable counterparts, but network
series are constantly adapting to
new business strategies and find-
ing ways to stay relevant in the
Twitter age. Proclaiming that art
and entertainment can only be
found on channels is incredibly
narrow-minded, and overlooks
the collection of diverse program-
ming found on traditional net-
works.
It's impossible to talk about
21st century network television
without first mentioning the
behemoth of Shondaland. Shonda
Rhimes' production company has
been an ABC staple since 2005,
when Chloe's Green Star List
alum "Grey's Anatomy" pre-
miered. With "Grey's Anatomy,"
Rhimes essentially changed the
face of TV. Where before eve-
ning TV was pogrammed for
men to enjoy after work, "Grey's"
popularized the female-centric
primetime soap. "Grey's" shame-
lessly featured the plot twists and
steamy sexual tension of a day-
time soap opera, but it reached an
unprecedented audience. It won
critical acclaim, Emmy awards
and ridiculously high ratings -
not just among females, but the
hyper-masculine boys in my sixth
grade drama class. The series is
entering its eleventh season, and
shows no sign of slowing down.
"Grey's Anatomy" is .still one of
the most-watched series on tele-
vision.
Along with other shows of its
era, "Grey's Anatomy" proved
that a top procedural series didn't
have to be set in a police precinct
or feature gruff, gun-toting men.
Female friendships, a diverse
and talented cast and whirlwind
romance were enough to draw in
viewers. "Grey's" paved the way
for other female-centric network
TV shows, like "The Good Wife,"
"Revenge" and "Nashville." This
new generation of primetime
soaps blends entertainment and
drama to create unique and com-
pelling television, no matter the
gender of its viewers.
Shonda Rhimes has followed
up on her "Grey's" success with
"Scandal" and the upcoming
"How to Get Away with Murder."
The series star award-winning
actresses Kerry Washington
("Django Unchained") and Viola
Davis ("The Help"), respectively.
The draw ofworking with Rhimes
might be enough to bring these
fantastic actresses to television,
but there has to be something
else at play. Network television
offers an unprecedented vari-
ety of great roles for women of
color. While cable-counterparts
continue to order shows about
angsty white men, ABC is kick-
ing off a trend of providing more
diverse programming. Represen-
tation pays off in higher ratings
- not surprisingly, Black viewers
are likely to tune into shows in
which Black characters play cen-
tral roles. "Grey's Anatomy" and
"Scandal" are especially popular
in Black households, and some of
the other top series for this demo-
graphic include well-knownBlack

actresses as main characters (Tar-
aji P. Henson in "Person of Inter-
est," Nicole Beharie in "Sleepy

Hollow"). Like "Grey's Anatomy,"
these series aren't just popular in
this specific demographic. "Scan-
dal" and "Sleepy Hollow" have
top ratings nationwide.
Other networks are beginning
to follow ABC's successful busi-
ness model. Since TV series that
feature all-white casts tend to be
the lowest-rated, networks are
ordering more showsawith diverse
leads. CBS's summer hit "Extant"
stars Oscar winner Halle Berry
as an independent astronaut, and
Fox premiered the third season of
the raucously funny "The Mindy
Project" "Mindy" is not only the
first American sitcom centered on
an Indian-American woman but is
also led by the only Indian-Amer-
ican showrunner in Hollywood
right now. Diverse casting has
made significant progress since
"Grey's Anatomy" and "Lost,"
and on network TV, you can now
find a materialistic Indian goof-
ball, a gay Latina cheerleader and
a Black leading lady'detective on
primetime. Though stereotyping
isn't completely gone, the variety
of personalities associated with
characters of color is becom-
ing much more realistic. This
isn't your grandmother's net-
work television. While cable lags
behind, network TV is making
great strides in acknowledging its
diverse viewers.
Barring any more discussion of
race and gender, a lot of network
TV shows are just damn good.
"Hannibal" features such stun-
ning visuals and subtle acting
that it's practically unrecogniz-
able as a "typical network show."
There's plenty of violence, more
gut-wrenching than anything
I've seen on "Game of Thrones"
- if you're whining about how
broadcast networks censor gore,
get back to me once you've seen
Mason Verger feed his ownface to
a dog. There's sex, too, but restric-
tions on nudityeliminatethe male
gaze that pervades most steamy
scenes on cable. "Hannibal" aired
a threesome sex scene last sea-
son, and it was actually creatively
filmed and edited (as opposed to
consecutive close-ups of Emilia
Clarke's boobs, which is how we
all know the same scene would
.have been handled on "Game of
Thrones"). Many critics, (includ-
ing this one), list "Hannibal" near
the top of their favorite programs
on television, right up there with
shows like "True Detective" and
"BreakingBad." Itdoesn'tdeserve
that spot just because it's good
"for network." It's fucking great
television - comparable to any-
thing on cable, if not even better.
Network television isn't dead.
It's alive and thriving, though
its face is no longer recognizably
white or male, nor is its program-
ming comparable to whatever
was airing ten years ago. TV
is an evolving creature, and as
cable and streaming have added
new challenges, network TV has
adapted to its new environment.

Coon leads sophomore class

By BEN FIDELMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Adam Coon, like he has
all season, dominated the
competition this summer.
Only this time, he traded in
his maize and blue singlet for
one with "USA" on the chest.
The sophomore was selected
to compete for Team USA in
the FILA World Championships
in Croatia, and was the only
wrestler to enter both the
Greco-Roman and freestyle
tournaments. He took home
bronze medals in both.
Michigan wrestling coach Joe
McFarland wants his team to
learn from all competitions, and
Coon believes he has learned
from last year's postseason and
this summer's international
events. Coon said watching
many of the competing nations,
including Iranians, Georgians
and Russians, allowed him to
see what it was like to have
flawless technique and be extra
aggressive - somethinghe's now
focusing on back in Ann Arbor.
"If I can combine both of
those," Coon said. "I will be
absolutely unstoppable. Perfect,
technique with the aggression
to go with it - that's your
perfect recipe."
Coon's performance was
impressive not only because of
the end result - two medals -
but also how he won them. In the
10 total matches over the course
of both tournaments, Coon went
8-2 with two technical falls and
five pins.
"Those numbers are
nothing less than impressive,"
McFarland. "The way he made
the teams and how he competed
in both the Greco and Freestyle,
which is virtually unheard
of, really says a lot about his
character and the kind of
competitor he is."
After he spent most of his

Preview: Tempo a test

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
ManagingSports Editor
Will Utah really threaten the
Michigan football team Saturday
afternoon at the Big House?
If you believe the betting lines,
yes.
The Utes (2-0) are just 4.5-point
underdogs after averaging nearly a
point a minute in a pair of blowouts
to start the season. Travis Wilson,
in his third season at quarterback,
boasts the second-highest passer
efficiency rating inthe country and
hasn't thrown an interception.
Receiver Dres Anderson, who
averaged nearly 19 yards per
catch last year, has gotten off to
a similarly explosive start in his
senior season. Two of his three
Im receptions against Fresno State
were for touchdowns, and he has
already accumulated 195 yards.
Because of an early bye week,
Wilson and Anderson had extra
time to prepare to face a Wolverine
secondary that coach Brady Hoke
admitted was "embarrassed"
two weeks ago in a 31-0 drubbing

against Notre Dame. And Utah
has a precedent of winning at
Michigan Stadium, taking down
the Wolverines in 2008.
The Utes run a spread offense,
which Michigan defensive
coordinator Greg Mattison
compared to Indiana's because
of its high-speed tempo. And last
year, the Hoosiers burned the
Wolverines for 572 yards and 47
points, frequently snapping the
ball before the defense could get
fully set.-
But don't necessarily expect the
Utes to roll over Michigan.
As MGoBlog's Ace Anbender
noted, despite Utah's frequent
four- and five-receiver sets, it
utilizes a spread-to-run attack,
meaning it relies on the rush to
set up the pass. In that aspect, the
Wolverines are well-suited; they
have allowed fewer than 100 yards
on the ground in their last two
games combined.
Of the defensive linemen,
senior end Frank Clark could be
Michigan's most effective player
Saturday. He has just two tackles

for loss this season but has become
the Wolverines' most consistent
threat at shedding his blocker and
disrupting a play.
And if Michigan's coaches have
their way, they'll avoid a track
meet between the two offenses
Saturday.
"We've got so much that we
want to accomplish on defense, and
this is the next game," Mattison
said Monday.
Another reason for optimism
for the Wolverines comes in the
quality of the Utes' opponents,
or lack thereof. Fresno State
and Idaho State have only one
combined win - the Bengals beat
Division II Chadron State by five -
and despite Michigan's struggles,
it'll easily be the most talented
team Utah has faced.
But the Utes are no cupcake,
and the Wolverines will have their
hands full come Saturday.
NOTE: Before the game,
a 15-aircraft flyover will
commemorate the centennial
anniversary of the University's
aerospace engineering program.

Q&A: Utes beat writer Ryan Miller

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily
Michigan's offense will have to keep pace with Utah's quick-strike attack Saturday.
'D' faces challenge

By GREG GARNO
Managing Sports Editor
The Michigan football team
last met Utah in 2008 - a 25-23
loss - when the Utes were a part
of the Mountain West Conference.
Now, Utah is finding its place in
the Pac-12. The Daily spoke with
the Utah Daily Chronicle's Ryan
Miller, an assistant sports editor,
to take a look at the Wolverines'
next opponent.
The Michigan Daily: There's
a lot of hype surrounding Utah
quarterback Travis Wilson.
What does he do so well that has
allowed him to carry the Utes? '
Ryan Miller: Really, he's
playing in a safer passing game.
The new offense put in by
(offensive coordinator) Dave
Christensen has been all about
limiting turnovers. Wilson,
last year, was known to air it
out. If it's an interception, it's
an interception. He'd have six-
interception games.
This year, he hasn't had one
because he's just making safer
throws. The offense is designed
where there's always a check-

down guy, always an easy slant
route. There's a throw to be
made, often for a few yards if
anything else. He's making those
decisions rather than think 'I
gotta go 40 yards.' I think it's
the better decision making and
better offense that'd helped.
TMD: I know it has been
just two games, but has anyone
shown signs of slowing down
Utah's offense?
RM: Right now, it seems like
no one can, but that's really more
of the opponent than anything.
They could have put i up even
more against Fresno State.
I don't really think they've
revealed everything, either. But
they're finally facing a team that
has the athletes to stop an offense
like this. It'll be interesting to see
what Michigan does.
TMD: Utah's defense is a bit
overlooked by its potent offense.
Where do its strengths lie?
RM: Well, at first against
Idaho State, the defense didn't
look - good. But against Fresno
State, they shut them down. The
defensive line, has been, and
always will be, the strength under
(head coach) Kyle Wittingham.

I'd be more concerned about
the secondary. I think they'll be
able to withstand the Michigan
run defense, which will be really
important. If they can hold the
rushing attack then I think they
have a pretty good chance in this
game.
TMD: The Utes enter off a bye
week early in the season. Will
that help them come Saturday or
is that not much of a factor?
RM: Aside from last season,
Wittingham actually had a great
record coming off a bye. But I
really think what will help is
coming off of injuries. They
were pretty banged up after
Fresno State. We know Jason
Wittingham won't be playing
the linebacker, but they hope to
have Gionni Paul coming back
for his first game. Michigan has
the same policy, where Utah just
won't talk about them at all.
TMD: What's your prediction
for Saturday?
RM: I've been going back and.
forth on this all week.
I actually think this will be
the coming-out party of Travis
Wilson. I'llsay a 27-20 victory for
Utah.

Michigan pass offense vs.
Utah pass defense
Against Fresno State two weeks
ago, Utah sacked the quarterback
seven times. Defensive end Nate
orchard anchors a Utes' defense
that leads the nation in sacks (5.5)
and tackles for loss (10.5) per game.
On the bright side, the Wolver-
ines should be getting junior wide
receiver Devin Funchess back,
and it will significantly open up
the offense for quarterback Devin
Gardner. And the Utes have only
intercepted one pass over their last
nine games.
Edge: Michigan
Michigan rush offense vs.
Utah rush defense
Utah's rush defense allowed just
55 yards against Fresno State. The
strong performance came after the
defensive line was called "soft" by
Idaho State's coach, following the
Utes' week one performance. The
defense also racked up 13 tackles
for loss.
Edge: Utah

Utah pass offense vs.
Michigan pass defense
Senior receiver Dres Anderson
is a big playmaker and averages
over 16 yards per catch over his
career, so the Michigan secondary
will have its hands full.
But Utah's offense will meet
its first big test against the Wol-
verines' seventh-ranked defense.
Mattison's unit is holding oppo-
nents to 252.7 yards per game and
4.12 yards per play.
Edge: Utah

Utah's offense goes beyond its

per carry. Combine that with Wil-
son's dual-threat abilities, and the
Michigan linebackers will be on
their toes all afternoon.
But the Wolverine defensive line
is arguably the team's deepest unit
and has held opposing offenses to
an average of 80 rushing yards per
game.

But in football, success, It didn't matter if he was-

running drills, in a meeting or
even getting yelled at by a coach,
Henry's facial expression was the
same. He never stopped smiling
and laughing with his teammates.
"He's a joker," Ginn said. "He's
just a good kid. He's playing
around so much, he's joking
around so much. And I think in
the beginning it kind of hurt him."
During practice at Glenville,
that joking was constant, which
irked Ginn. He felt' as though
Henry's jesting prevented him
from making all of the plays he
could've.
Ginn said Henry's joviality
was a combination of being just a
happy-go-lucky guy and a little bit
of immaturity..
"You could be talking to him
about something serious and he'll
look at you and laugh," Ginn said.
"And it will frustrate you."
In order to fulfill his potential
as a college football player,.Henry
had to shed some of that playful
mentality. And that was a process.
Before his senior year, Ginn
began to see some changes in
Henry. The smile was still. there,
but he began to show some of
the fire and maturity Ginn was
looking for.
Glenville was short on depth on
the offensive line and Henry said
he'd play both ways. He started
on offense and defense that year,
beginning a trend of leadership
from Henry. When it was needed,
he spoke up for the good of the
team.
Ginn said the recruiting process
brought out the seriousness in
Henry, but it wasn't immediate.
During one recruiting visit, Henry
goofed around the entire time.
Then, he really heard it from Ginn.
"I got on him real tough,"
Ginn said. "And that's the time
that I saw he looked real serious,
because he knew I wasn't playing
with him.
"I cut that smile off his face."
Ginn knew Henry could play
in college from the first time they
met, and he wasn't goingto let him
risk anything.
Hepry was serious about
recruiting from that moment
on., Still, he wasn't considered
a can't-miss prospect. His offer
sheet was composed primarily of
schools from the Mid-American
Conference and the Big East
before Michigan offered.
"It was the greatest day of my
life when I got the offer, they
told me that I had the offer from
Michigan," Henry said last week.
"I cherished that moment, put it
in a jar, Coach Hoke would say,
sealed it up."
He didn't wait long to commit,

giving his pledge soon after he
was offered in late January 2012.
Like he did with Michigan
senior defensive end Frank Clark,
another unheralded recruit
from Glenville, Ginn told the
Wolverines' coaching staff about
the potential he saw in Henry.
Michigan asked him what he saw
in his own players, whereas many
college coaches don't make similar
efforts in the recruiting process,
relying on scouting rankings and
film instead.
Because of their faith in Ginn,
the Wolverines found two of their
starters on the defensive line.
But once he was in Ann Arbor,
his easygoing demeanor prevailed
again. He was still joking around,
but this time the stakes were
higher.
"It's a good thing more so
than it's a bad thing," Ginn said
of Henry's attitude. "It's a bad
thing because if you don't really
understand him, you're going to
misread him."
Ginn thinks this negative side of
his playfulness caught up to Henry
a little bit in his first two years at
Michigan. After redshirting his
first year, Henry frequently found
himself on the bench early in his
second season.
When he was on the field, the
coaches noticed Henry didn't run
to the ball on every play and he
wasn't serious enough for their
liking. Once again, coaches felt
as though the effort wasn't fully
there. He needed to mature.
"They don't have time for that,"
Ginn said.
This season, Henry has become
more serious once again, starting
all three games and playing a
major role in the Wolverines'
stout run defense. Hoke says the
6-foot-2, 293-pounder may be the
strongest player on the team.
Last week, Michigan's coaches
noted Henry's increased desire
and maturity. For the first time,
his effort is a constant.
"You'll see (him) running to
the football in times of the game
where he wouldn't have before,"
said defensive coordinator Greg
Mattison.
As with most of his young
players, Hoke thought hearing
Tom Brady and Elvis Grbac speak
to the team - as well as watching a
video of Richard Sherman talking
about preparation - helped Henry
understand the responsibility
that comes with playing college
football.
In practice in the offseason,
defensive line coach Mark Smith
and Hoke pushed Henry every
day. They too didn't want to see
his potential go to waste.

To Henry, it felt differently than
it did when his coaches previously
demanded more.
"When you were immature, you
feel like they're picking on you,
but as you grow you see that they
just want the best for me," Henry
said.
This newfound maturity
brought out the best in Henry.
Instead of resting after drills or
going to the locker room early,
he did extra pushups and wind
sprints to become a better player.
The smile hasn't disappeared,
though. When he speaks with the
media, he flashes a toothy grin,
revealing his braces.
But because of Henry's
newfound dedication, Ginn
envisions a new future for his
former player, one that goes
beyond playing in college.
"He could be a guy that plays in
the NFL for 10 years," Ginn said.
That would give Henry yet
another reason to smile. This time,
his coaches would loin right in.
