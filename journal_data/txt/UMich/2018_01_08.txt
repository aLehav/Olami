The 
Centers 
for 
Disease 

Control and Prevention, the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration 
and the Public Health Agency 
of Canada are investigating the 
source of a recent E. coli outbreak 
that has infected 58 people and 
resulted in two deaths in the 
United States and Canada. This 
particular strain, called E. coli 
O157:H7, has been linked to leafy 
greens and romaine lettuce.

Between Nov. 15 and Dec. 

8, the disease spread to 13 
states, including Michigan, and 
multiple provinces in Canada. 
Though the disease is reported 
to have spread a month ago, 
public health notices are now 
being published.

Consumer 
Reports 
states 

E. 
coli 
symptoms 
typically 

surface one to three days after 
infection, but may take as long 
as 10 days. These symptoms 
include severe diarrhea and 
abdominal pain. This particular 
strain of E. coli can lead to 
serious illness, kidney failure 
and death if left untreated. 
Young children, the elderly 
and those with a weakened 
immune system are the most 
vulnerable to this illness.While 
the Public Health Agency of 
Canada has officially identified 
the source of the outbreak as 
romaine lettuce, the CDC is 
still investigating the possible 
origin. Preliminary results of 
CDC genome sequencing of the 

bacteria suggest the Canadian E. 
coli strain and the American E. 
coli strain are genetically closely 
related, indicating a common 
source of infection.

The Public Health Agency 

of Canada advised those in 
its eastern provinces to avoid 
romaine lettuce and eat other 
salad greens until further notice. 
The CDC has yet to recommend 
a particular food Americans 
should avoid.

Consumer 
Reports, 
a 

consumer-oriented 
research 

magazine based in the United 
States, advised people to avoid 
eating romaine lettuce until the 
cause of the E. coli outbreak is 
identified and removed from 
stores.

Consumer 
Reports 
added 

it could take time before any 
recall is secured and executed, a 
period during which consumers 
can potentially become infected. 

Jean Halloran, director of Food 
Policy Initiatives at Consumers 
Union, which is the policy 
division of Consumer Reports, 
says the FDA must act fast to 
identify and recall the source of 
the outbreak.

The outbreak has affected the 

University community as well. 

In the University 43rd annual 

Monitoring the Future study, 
researchers of the University’s 
Institute for Social Research 
surveyed 
about 
45,000 

secondary 
school 
students 

across the country on their use 
of marijuana, vapes, tobacco, 
alcohol, 
inhalants, 
heroin 

and opioids. The researchers 
released their findings in a 
summary 
titled 
“National 

Adolescent 
Drug 
Trends 
in 

2017,” and a full volume of their 
work will be released by the end 
of January.

The 
investigation, 
funded 

by the National Institute on 
Drug Abuse, surveyed students 
in grades 8, 10 and 12, and 
concluded 
marijuana 
use 

among all students increased 
significantly, from 22.7 percent 
in 2016 to 24 percent in 2017. 
Principal Investigator Richard 
Miech believes the substantial 
rise in marijuana use is related 
to the decrease in percieved risk.

Go Blue Guarantee, to take effect this semester, represents 
a step in the right direction for students, applicants

JULIA LAUER/DAILY

University says in-state students with household income below $65,000 will receive free tuition starting Winter 2018 

Starting this winter semester, 

the Go Blue Guarantee will begin 
to cover full tuition for in-state 
University students whose families 
make $65,000 a year or less. The 
commitment will automatically 

cover current qualifying students, 
as well as future students who 
apply and are admitted.

The 
Go 
Blue 
Guarantee, 

announced 
last 
summer, 

aims 
to 
encourage 
students 

from 
socioeconomically 

underrepresented 
communities 

to apply to the University, with 
the comfort that if admitted, 

they will be able to afford it. The 
University’s hope is to give high 
school students who otherwise 
wouldn’t 
have 
applied 
the 

confidence to do so.

At his appearance at the Senate 

Assembly on Dec. 11, Schlissel 
heralded the program as his 
greatest achievement as university 
president.

“I 
think 
we 
should 
all 

be 
extremely 
proud 
of 
that 

commitment we are making to 
opportunity across the breadth of 
our state,” Schlissel said.

He also mentioned how the 

early action applicant numbers for 
next year’s freshman class have 
risen from previous years, which 
he partly attributed to the Go Blue 

Guarantee.

“This 
year’s 
numbers, 
and 

I think it’s because of the Go 
Blue Guarantee in part, are even 
stronger (than previous years),” 
Schlissel said. “The December 
1st year over year numbers are 
significantly 
up 
in 
applicant 

numbers.”

While Schlissel suggested a rise 

in applications, no information has 
been officially released about how 
many students who qualify for 
the Go Blue Guarantee have been 
admitted to the 2018 freshman 
class.

The University is pursuing 

various advertising efforts to 
ensure Michigan high school

Following 
campus 
outrage 

over the impending visit of white 
supremacist 
Richard 
Spencer, 

the University has released a list 
of events to discuss free speech 
throughout 
winter 
semester 

titled 
“Speech 
and 
Inclusion: 

Recognizing Conflict and Building 
Tools for Engagement.”

At an emergency Board of 

Regents meeting in November, 
University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel 
announced 
that 
the 

University would allow Spencer 
to speak on campus provided they 
find a safe time and environment in 
which to do so, much to the dismay 
of many opposing students, faculty 
and community members. #Stop 
Spencer, a group committed to 
preventing the Spencer event, plan 
to protest Spencer’s event, though a 
specific Error! Hyperlink reference

determined.

Spencer’s lawyer, Kyle Bristow, 

threatened the University with a 
lawsuit if a date isn’t decided upon 
by January 15.

students are informed about 

the guarantee. The University 
has 
promoted 
the 
Go 
Blue 

Guarantee online through social 
media platforms and emails to 
prospective students in lower 
income communities. In addition, 
the 
Office 
of 
Undergraduate 

Admissions has incorporated the 

information about the guarantee 
into tours for Michigan high 
school students.

In an interview with the 

Daily in October, Kedra Ishop, 
the 
University’s 
Vice 
Provost 

for 
Enrollment 
Management, 

said reshaping public perception 
was one of the purposes of the 
guarantee.

“One of the premises of the 

Go Blue Guarantee was to recast 
our message, in the sense that we 

have aid available for students at 
the University of Michigan and 
we wanted to make sure that the 
public understands we have that 
aid available for students at the 
University of Michigan,” she said.

Andrew Xhelilaj, a sophomore 

at Michigan State University, 
found out about the Go Blue 
Guarantee when one of these 
advertising emails was sent to 
his sister. Since then, Xhelilaj 
has applied to transfer to the 

University in part because of 
the free tuition the Go Blue 
Guarantee would grant to him. 
 

Xhelilaj said he is a second-
generation immigrant and first-
generation college student, and 
wants to alleviate his family of 
some of the financial burdens of 
college.

Xhelilaj’s 
sister 
received 

ample financial aid when she 
attended the University because 
his family was less financially 
stable than they are currently. 
Xhelilaj would not have gotten 
the same level of financial aid 
as his sister did had he attended 
the University freshman year.

“My sister went to Michigan 

and she usually checks up on 
the school, and one day she 
had an email or had something 
sent to her (about the Go Blue 
Guarantee),” 
Xhelilaj 
said. 

“She showed me and I was 
like, ‘Oh, this is good,’ because 
my family makes just under 65 
(thousand dollars a year) and it 
seemed viable to actually attend 
Michigan again.”

Xhelilaj sees the Go Blue 

Guarantee as a step in the right 
direction for the University, and 

has been spreading the word to his 
friends and fellow classmates.

“I’ve 
told 
many 
people 

actually that Michigan’s financial 
aid package is very nice for 
underprivileged people,” Xhelilaj 
said. “That’s one of the reasons 
everyone wants to go there.”

LSA freshman Trenton Cox 

is a student who should qualify 
for free tuition under the Go Blue 
Guarantee. Cox is from Jackson, 
Michigan, and is paying for college 
with scholarships and loans. He 
agrees the Go Blue Guarantee 
is an encouraging sign from the 
University, but is concerned about 
whether or not he would actually 
receive the free tuition. Cox said 
he hasn’t obtained any personal 
notification his tuition will be 
covered, and is confused about the 
details.

“I’m happy about the Go Blue 

Guarantee being a thing, but I’m 
really worried that the University’s 
going to give me a hard time about 
it,” Cox said. “For having such a 
large endowment, Michigan is 
known to be like that sometimes.”

Cox said his family income for 

2016 was above $65,000, but this 
year it fell below that threshold. 
Even with a family income just 
about $65,000, Cox said he did not 
receive any need-based aid for last 
semester.

“I would argue that me and a lot 

of other people really could’ve used 
financial aid from the University,” 
Cox said.

GUARANTEE
From Page 1A


I have understood the power 

of words since a young age. I 
distinctly recall the first time I 
published a piece at age 13, and 
the apprehension with which 
I described my sentiments as 
a 
bi-ethnic 
second-generation 

Tibetan in exile.

Since then, I have approached 

writing with extreme caution. 
As with many Tibetans in the 
diaspora, 
speaking 
publicly 

about my identity has significant 
ramifications. By writing these 
words, however, I recognize I 
have great privilege in being able 
to share my experiences — such a 
luxury is not an option for many 
Tibetans in exile. Despite this, I 
have hesitated on many occasions 
to approach platforms such as 
Michigan in Color. I did not have 
the confidence to express the acute 
sense of loss, generational trauma 
and injustice that is so familiar to 
those who hold identities that are 
viscerally under attack.

Throughout 
the 
past 
year, 

engaging in activism on campus 
has been both encouraging and 
painful for me. Though I have 
found great support and inspiration 
in my peers, my resolve to approach 
MiC 
was 
strengthened 
by 

witnessing the active silencing of 
narratives such as mine within the 
Asian/Pacific Islander-American 
communities on campus. In these 
spaces — ones that claim to be 
inclusive of all A/PIAs — I have 
observed indifference, hesitation 
and 
outright 
hostility 
toward 

discussing histories and identities 
that are deemed too “divisive,” 
“political” and “inconvenient.” The 
greatest irony in this suppression is 
that these spaces were never meant 
to be comfortable.

Histories 
of 
oppression 

are not easy to acknowledge, 
particularly by those who inflict 
structural violence. But comfort, 
as history tells it, preserves the 
status quo. Comfort reinforces 
the mechanisms of subjugation. 
And there is a pressing need to 
recognize this, particularly in 
spaces that claim to be proponents 

of social justice.

In my time on campus, MiC has 

been an outlet through which I have 
engaged with narratives that have 
made me deeply uncomfortable 
with systemic norms, institutional 
silencing and my own complicity. 
As a staff member, I hope to 
navigate this space with intention 
and conscience as a proud Tibetan/
Indian-American, even as forces 
beyond me invalidate my Tibetan 
identity and discount me on 
the basis of my bi-ethnicity. To 
some degree, I write these words 
knowing that I am subjecting 
myself to the scrutiny of institutions 
that are antagonized by my very 
existence and willingness to assert 
the validity of my experiences.

Yet, everything that I write 

is from my lived experience. I 
encourage those — even individuals 
who do not have the privilege of a 
public platform — to speak their 
truths and stand behind their 
realities. That is why I mobilize 
myself and my words, and it is 
because of these hopes that I have 
joined MiC.

The very first occupation I 

was interested in becoming was a 
police officer; whenever one was 
around, I could not take my eyes 
off of their gleaming badges. For 
an assignment in school during 
kindergarten, I was asked what I 
wanted to be when I grow up and 
why. I wrote: “A police officer so 
I can arrest people.” My family 

found it humorous, but when I 
think back to the assignment now, 
all I feel is shame. 

This feeling began after the 

Trayvon Martin shooting of 2012. 
The Black community was furious; 
surely this was not the first time a 
white person had unfairly shot and 
killed a Black male. However, this 
was the final straw. I remember 
the climate so vividly, the utter 
disgust. The unrest was palpable. 
During the following years, there 
was a sharp increase in the number 

of deaths in the Black community 
at the hands of white cops, all 
while on camera.

Whether it was because I was 

paying more attention or because 
times had truly become much 
worse, the bloodshed seemed to 
multiply out of nowhere, and now 
as a young Black teenage male, I 
became more and more afraid with 
every newscast. Turning off the 
TV didn’t fix the problem; my life 
at home was beginning to fall apart 
as well. In 2011, my parents had 
filed for divorce, and since then 
my parents have both moved from 
our home in Detroit to Southfield 
(where they “consequently” found 
apartment buildings across the 
street from one another).

As part of the move, I was also 

forced to start sixth grade in a 
new school. In an attempt to make 
friends I became swept up in 
staying up-to-date with the most 
current music. I dove headfirst 
into the pop music of 2010, and 
what I gravitated to most was hip-

hop. It allowed me to look at people 
who looked like me and hear them 
talking about things I too had 
experienced. I saw the beauty 
behind rap through Frank Ocean, 
as well as its anger and passion 
concerning issues of the Black 
man in America when listening to 
artists such as J. Cole and Kendrick 
Lamar. A few friends suggested I 
try writing myself, and ever since, 
I have been documenting my 
feelings in the form of raps, poems, 
essays and the occasional angrily 
scribbled rant. 

I joined Michigan in Color 

because I believe my voice speaks 
for not only myself but everyone 
who is able to share my thoughts, 
emotions and experiences. Being a 
person of color at a predominantly 
white institution in 2018 is a 
journey, one full of pleasant 
surprises as well as shocking 
disappointment. When I write for 
MiC, I want everyone reading to 
feel as if we are on this journey 
together.

Michigan in Color
Monday, January 8, 2018— 3A

I’ve always loved storytelling 

and I’m always searching for new 
ways to tell stories. I love singing, 
performing, 
art, 
music 
and, 

most relevantly, writing. Since 
I’ve started college, I’ve added 
some new passions to my list. 
I’ve started to write poetry as a 
way to express my thoughts and 
feelings. I’ve also expanded the 
genres of stories I read to include 
plays, articles and magazines.

When I discovered Michigan 

in Color, I was quickly able to 
add it to my list of passions. The 
concept of MiC was completely 
foreign to me, but I immediately 
fell in love with it — a section in 
a newspaper dedicated solely 
to people of color to share their 
experiences 
and 
identities. 

Though I’ve always enjoyed 

writing, my identity as a person 
of color has never been the topic 
of my writing, or something I’ve 
even considered writing about.

My 
identity 
has 
always 

been something with which 
I’ve struggled. Growing up in 
a mostly homogenous society, 
I’ve had trouble feeling like I 
fit in. In high school, because 
almost everyone around me was 
white, my main goal was to just 
blend in. I never brought up my 
Nigerian heritage, my identity as 
a black person, my Muslim and 
Christian religious backgrounds, 
because I was trying my hardest 
to make sure everyone forgot 
them (secretly with the hopes 
that I would too).

But since I’ve come to college, 

I’ve begun to see my identity, 
especially as a person of color, 
as something of which to be 
proud. I’ve met so many people 
that have helped me realize my 

different identities are things 
to uphold instead of hiding. 
What I love about Michigan 
in Color is its ability to elevate 
people of the identities they are 
typically shamed for. I love how 
it’s a space for people to be open 
and vulnerable, to share the 
hardships and triumphs they face 
as a person of color for people to 
resonate with and learn from.

I still have a long way to go in 

embracing who I am, but I know 
Michigan in Color is definitely a 
step in the right direction. And 
not only is it an opportunity to 
help me accept my identities, it’s 
a privilege. I have been given the 
privilege to help others embrace 
their 
own 
identities 
while 

educating others about these 
identities at the same time. I’m so 
lucky to be given this privilege, 
and as an assistant editor, I will 
make sure it never goes to waste.

Growing up, I always loved 

to read. Some of my fondest 
childhood 
memories 
include 

going to the library with my 
mom to pick out books, and then 
reading them together. As I got 
older, I developed a passion for 
writing as well, finding my voice 
and feeling the true power the 
written word can hold. I enjoyed 
writing in my English classes, and 
I also wrote and continue to write 
in a journal as an outlet for my 
frustrations and emotions. I have 
never really considered sharing 
any of my writing, as I was never 
confident enough and never really 

felt like I had something very 
important or progressive to say. 
Stumbling upon this opportunity 
has opened my eyes to what could 
be, and I intend to make the most 
of it as I navigate my way through 
college as an Arab-American, 
Muslim woman.

Coming to the University from 

my predominantly Arab/Muslim 
city of Dearborn has been an 
awakening experience. I have 
been challenged and changed 
in ways I would never have 
thought of before. Throughout 
my first semester, I have met so 
many amazing, passionate and 
inspiring people, and learned 
their stories. I have encountered 
issues that have instilled me with 
anger, moved me with passion 

and inspired me to become an 
active part of the stories around 
me. Being a part of the Michigan 
Community Scholars Program 
and the Arab Student Association 
has helped me get to know people 
with 
different 
backgrounds 

while simultaneously connecting 
with those of similar social 
identities. The constant, ever-
changing climate of social issues 
and problems that need to be 
addressed compel me to try and 
find ways to make an impact, big 
or small.

I enter MiC as an assistant 

editor with high hopes. Hopes of 
speaking my truths and becoming 
more confident in doing so. 
Hopes of learning the stories and 
struggles of other brave and bright 
students of color, all with unique 
experiences and stories waiting 
to be heard. Hopes of helping 
to create and maintain the fun, 
serious, loving space so fondly 
described by previous and current 
MiC members. Hopes of building 
meaningful friendships with the 
wonderful fellow editors. Words 
hold power, words have weight, 
words can teach and connect 
and inspire and heal. I hope to 
do my part in a space that allows 
the words of people of color to be 
heard because our stories arereal, 
valid and important.

Growing up, Nick at Nite was 

somewhat of childhood pastime 
as shows like “George Lopez,” 
“The 
Nanny” 
and 
“Family 

Matters” were the focus of my 
attention. I found particular 
fondness in “Family Matters” 
because of Steve Urkel’s famous 
tagline, “Did I do that?” Though 
Steve Urkel was great, it was 
the sentimental moments that 
also caught my attention. In one 
of the episodes, Laura wanted 
to buy a VCR, so she sold her 
grandmother’s quilt. Later, she 
finds out the quilt was in the 
family for over 200 years.

Slowly I came to idolize 

minorities in the mainstream 
media. 
Shows 
like 
“Family 

Matters” proved there was a 
market for loving a non-white 
history. 
However, 
it 
never 

seemed like Arab history was 
profitable enough to make the 
cut. Though my family went 
to the Middle East for months 
every summer, I identified as 
American. Thus, I quickly heard 
terms like “whitewashed” as I 
joined the Boy Scouts and other 
typical “American” pastimes. 
Meanwhile, I was never white, 
so I still faced problems with 
being a person of color. Growing 
up, I felt that being Arab or 
American were two mutually 
exclusive concepts because we 

act like they are.

That is what lead me to 

Michigan in Color. The Arab 
culture 
that 
I 
have 
been 

surrounded by my entire life is 
important to me, and I wanted 
to 
express 
its 
significance 

while helping others do the 
same. This is my first step to 
creating my own quilt which I 
lost many years ago, or maybe 
it’s finding the blanket I never 
knew existed. For me, I may 
not be actively involved in the 
Arab community, but I am still 
Arab and American. Every day, 
I used to watch Nick at Nite and 
see people of varied skin tones, 
but none of those skin tones 
were mine. Even today, I don’t 
think I have any Arab-American 
idols that are represented in 
media. It’s easy to sell your 
culture in exchange for a job, 
to buy that fancy VCR or social 
acceptance. However, it starts 
with me to pick up the thread 
and create something that can 
last 200 years. Someday, I just 
hope to look back at my amazing 
work with Michigan in Color 
and think, “Did I do that?” It’s 
questions like those that keep me 
trying to prove my lineage does 
not cancel the program of my 
future. My activities shouldn’t 
disconnect me from my original 
storyline.

I

belong 
to 
“The 
Broken 

Generation”, at least according 
to a story run by Maclean’s 

(think Canada’s The Atlantic) in 
2012.

Aggregate survey data from the 

Healthy Minds Network run out of 
the University of Michigan show 25 
percent of college students report 
having depression. This statistic 
comes from no small study; Healthy 
Minds has had over 175,000 survey 
respondents to date.

Mental health is just as important 

as physical health, and mental 
illness is a serious public health 
issue. Depression is the leading 
cause of disability worldwide. 
Among young adults aged 15 to 
24, suicide was the third leading 
killer in 2010. Alcohol use disorder, 
which is a form of mental illness, 
is also widespread among college 
students (20 percent) with about 
one in four of us reporting academic 
consequences from alcohol and 
more than 1,800 of us are dying 
each year due to an alcohol-related 
injury.

Of course, you probably already 

knew that mental health was a 
concern on campus. Regardless of 
how you feel about the University’s 
handling of student mental health, 
their messaging has been anything 
but subtle. For what seems like 
a thousand times, I have been 
told about the existence of the 
Counseling 
and 
Psychological 

Services, also known as CAPS: by 
housing staff, by professors and by 
University administration in tritely-
worded emails. CAPS is only the tip 
of the iceberg, though. Almost every 
unit or group on campus seems to 
want to do something surrounding 
mental health, be it the backpacks 
on the Diag commemorating those 
lost to suicide to Central Student 
Government’s myriad of destress 
events. Like I said, anything but 
subtle.

As a University student with 

a mental illness, I appreciate the 
amount of positive discourse the 
subject gets; however, important 
points, ones that have been critical 
in my own journey, are too often lost 
or glossed over.

I have had a mental health 

problem since at least middle 
school; however, I did not face my 
depression until the very end of my 
senior year of high school. It took 
the advice of a very good friend for 
me to realize what was going on and 
to seek help. Then began a journey 

toward overcoming that mental 
illness, a journey that I am still on 
today.

The first point that campus 

discourse on mental health, in my 
opinion, misses is the power of 
knowing your enemy. I believe that 
a diagnosis, be it for depression, 
general anxiety, social anxiety, etc., 
can be an important step toward 
improving 
mental 
health. 
For 

me, having something to expect 
from my mental health problem, 
i.e. 
racing 
negative 
thoughts, 

empowers me to put these thoughts 
in their context so they do not cause 
me distress. Incessant, percussive 
doubts like those that told me I 
had no true friends used to make 
me feel even worse. Now, however, 
I can recognize those thoughts as 
a symptom of depression and that 
there is no logical basis for those 
doubts. It’s not easy to do; after all, 
these are my thoughts. Nevertheless, 
learning to understand symptoms 
as symptoms has been enormously 
helpful to me.

According 
to 
University 

research, only 34 to 36 percent 
of college students with mood 
disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar 
disorder) seek treatment. Why are 
so many students neglecting care? 
It’s not because they are not aware 
of treatment options on campus. 
Instead, the most common given 
reasons are “I prefer to deal with 
issues on my own,” “I question how 
serious my needs are,” “stress is 
a normal part of college” and “no 
time.” 

Many people I have talked to 

who do not seek treatment for 
mental illness espouse a similar 
idea: that they know what is causing 
them stress and therefore can act to 
relieve it and relieve their mental 
illness. While I often know the 

source of my stress (e.g., an organic 
chemistry exam) and what I need 
to do (get the exam over with), that 
stress has a life of its own. This can 
most clearly be felt when I have done 
everything imaginable to ensure 
a satisfactory outcome but still the 
stress persists. Furthermore, just 
because the source of the stress 
is known does not mean that that 
stress is any less real or burdensome.

The journey I have been on, with 

mental illness as my companion, 
has not been a linear progression. 
Sometimes, in fact, it seems that for 
every step forward I take, I must 
take three steps back. A second 
issue that mental health discourse 
on campus neglects is painting a 
realistic picture of treatment. There 
is no guarantee that any medication 
your doctor prescribes will help, and 
the same goes for psychotherapy. 
When promoting mental health, the 
University and other entities need 
to be candid about this nuance. 
Otherwise, I fear that those who do 
seek help will be turned off to the 
process far too early.

These things take time. I have 

been on four different medications 
since I was diagnosed with clinical 
depression in 2015 and have just 
started going to CAPS in addition 
to the medication I am currently on. 
Mental illnesses are complex but 
treatable. The right treatment is out 
there, it just may take a while to find. 
I wish I had really known that when 
I started my journey.

I acknowledge that everyone 

is different, and so is their mental 
health. I present the lessons I have 
learned in my own journey both 
to continue my healing and to 
hopefully inspire further nuanced 
dialog on this critical subject.

A

s 2017 turns to 2018, 
and the age of President 
Donald Trump continues 

into 
its 
second 
year, 
the 

emotional roller coaster that 
has taken place for progressive 
Americans has been nothing 
short of exhausting and difficult. 
From Special Counsel Robert 
Mueller’s 
investigation 
into 

the Trump campaign’s alleged 
collusion with Russian interests 
to sway the 2016 election, to 
the 
numerous 
attempts 
to 

repeal 
the 
Affordable 
Care 

Act, Democrats have been left 
without a single topic with 
which to focus their opposition. 
This has led many progressives 
down a dangerous path of 
disorganized 
brinkmanship 

that will only serve to advance 
Republican 
policy 
proposals 

into the remainder of the Trump 
administration.

Last year’s biggest policy 

debate was the Republican led 
effort to repeal the Affordable 
Care Act, commonly known as 
“Obamacare.” Democrats were 
steadfast in their opposition 
to the repeal of the ACA - 
dramatically defeating a repeal 
bill on the floor of the US 
Senate in September. However, 
while 
we 
were 
celebrating 

the preservation of the ACA, 
progressives 
unknowingly 

walked Obamacare to its grave.

December’s 
GOP-led 
tax 

overhaul bill - called the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017- 
represented 
the 
culmination 

of a year’s worth of policy 
objectives built into one bill. In 
addition to cutting corporate 
taxes and reducing tax brackets, 
the bill - which was signed into 
law by President Trump on 
December 22nd - also repeals 
the “individual mandate” of 

the ACA, which requires that 
all Americans purchase health 
insurance - or pay a tax penalty.

The passage of the Tax Cuts 

and Jobs Act is a failure on all 
levels by progressives to come 
together to advocate for the best 
interests of their constituents. 
President Trump tweeted on 
December 26th “Based on the 
fact that the very unfair and 
unpopular Individual Mandate 
has been terminated as part 
of our Tax Cut Bill, which 
essentially Repeals (over time) 
ObamaCare, the Democrats & 
Republicans 
will 
eventually 

come together and develop a 
great new HealthCare plan! [sic]” 
correctly suggesting that the 
repeal of the Individual mandate 
will bring about the end of ACA 
health insurance markets. This 
means more expensive insurance 
for everyone in addition to tax 
cuts for wealthy Americans. At 
the least, a complete repeal of 
the ACA would have elevated 
discussion of replacement, but 
the repeal we see now leaves 
everyone worse off.

As Congressional Democrats 

eye 
their 
next 
target 
for 

“resisting” 
the 
Trump 

Administration’s policy agenda - 
which may be shutting down the 
government over the Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals 
program, commonly known as 
DACA. No progressives can feel 
good about what has happened 
thus 
far 
during 
President 

Trump’s first term in office. Even 
as the focus of pundits shifts to 
the upcoming midterm elections, 
and the special elections in 
Alabama and elsewhere, many 
on the left have placed their 
hopes in the impending “wave” 
of Democratic wins that will 
reclaim control of the legislature. 

With this shift of focus goes 
any hope of creating change, or 
ensuring the best representation 
of the people.

While dreaming of 2018 wins 

and celebrating the symbolic 
preservation of Obamacare are 
good for public perception of 
Democrats, 
progressives 
are 

failing their constituents on 
all levels to protect the values 
that they believe in, and are 
failing to stop the Trump 
Administration’s 
objectives, 

which fly in the face of the 
demonstrated 
interests 
of 

progressive Americans. In order 
to serve their constituents best, 
progressive 
Congressional 

Democrats have to get real 
about stopping Trump’s policy 
proposals - even if this means 
giving 
in 
on 
other 
policy 

areas that are less important. 
If every Democratic call to 
action is a boilerplate “call your 
senator” and “elections have 
consequences” then the call to 
action isn’t action, but is rather 
kicking the can down the road, 
with the hopes of Democratic 
majority in the future.

This isn’t an outcome we can 

accept, as progressives, students, 
or members of communities that 
will be affected by public policy 
changes in 2018. Doing nothing 
is a statement in and of itself, 
and while beneficial to the party, 
cannot benefit the people of the 
United States, and only those in 
Congress can avoid it. Democrats 
have 
already 
made 
their 

disdain for President Trump 
expressly clear, but the time for 
grandstanding is over, and the 
time for protecting American 
institutions is in order.

T

he 
average 
American 

consumer spends 24 hours 
per week listening to 

music. Among those consumers, 
the most popular genre to listen 
to is R&B and hip hop. In fact, 
Forbes reports R&B and hip hop 
are responsible for 25.1 percent 
of all music consumption in the 
United States. 
 Earlier this fall, it was almost 
impossible to turn on the radio 
and not hear the song “Rockstar” 
by Post Malone and 21 Savage, 
which led the Billboard Hot 100 
for eight consecutive weeks. So, 
it’s reasonable to say a significant 
portion of our population likes 
rap music. It’s even reasonable 
to say rap music, and rappers 
specifically, exert an influence on 
the values of their listeners and 
thus popular culture. 
 Take a look at the anticipation 
surrounding the release of Kanye 
West’s new clothing collection, 
Yeezy Season 6, for example. 
This is why rappers, with such a 
massive platform and the ability 
to influence millions of fans, must 
also face responsibility for their 
words and actions.

As an outcome of the #MeToo 

movement, 
which 
denounces 

sexual assault and harassment, 
several 
men 
in 
positions 
of 

power, from Sen. Al Franken of 
Minnesota to comedian Louis 
C.K., have finally been held 
accountable 
after 
decades 
of 

getting away with horrendous acts 
of sexism. As a dedicated fan of hip 
hop, I understand its significance 
as a cultural phenomenon with a 
deep-rooted history of art, words 
and movement. And as a cultural 
phenomenon, it must lead by 
example, particularly in the way it 
treats women. It is time for rappers 
to be held accountable.

It’s no secret that misogyny 

and sexism have troubled the 
hip-hop world for quite some 
time. It’s also no secret that the 
issue has, for the most part, 
 

been dismissed in the industry. 
Remember when the makers of 
“Straight Outta Compton” left out 
the part about Dr. Dre’s abusive 
behavior toward women? Or 
how about the fact that rapper 
Rick Ross refuses to sign female 
artists to his record label in fear 
that his desire to have sexual 
relations with them would get in 
the way? In a recent interview 

with The Breakfast Club, Ross 
openly explained his rationale: 
“I gotta be honest with you. She’s 
lookin’ good. I’m spending so 
much money on her photo shoots 
— I gotta f**k a couple times.” 
Not only is Ross unashamedly 
objectifying 
this 
hypothetical 

female artist, but his reasoning 
shows he believes he is entitled to 
the artist’s body because he spent 
“so much money” promoting her 
— he deserves sex. His ideology 
reflects a male-dominated field 
with little regard for women as 
professional equals, but instead 
as commodified sex objects.

In a more direct sense, lyrics 

hold the most direct influence 
over fans. Lyrics are sung by fans, 
used as captions for pictures and 

can even become common slang 
(remember “thot”?). As a female 
listener with a president who 
dismisses jokes about grabbing 
women’s 
genitals 
as 
“locker 

room” talk, it is growing more 
and more frustrating to listen to 
rap lyrics. Take the beginning of 
21 Savage’s verse from “Rockstar,” 
for example: “Drankin Henny, 
bad b*****s jumping in the pool/
And they ain’t got on no bra (bra)/
Hit her from the back, pulling on 
her tracks/And now she screaming 
out, ‘No Mas!’”

21 Savage paints the picture 

of a pool party filled with naked 
women who clearly have nothing 
better to do than drink and 
be sexy. Next, he jumps into a 
vulgar description of having 
rough, 
potentially 
unwanted 

intercourse with a woman who 
is begging him to stop. To me, 
the above exchange does not 
seem 
consensual. 
It 
doesn’t 

seem enjoyable for the woman; 
on the contrary, she wants it to 
end. To me, it seems like sexual 
assault. As a female listener, it is 
disgusting to hear lyrics like this. 

I ask myself, “How on earth was 
this song, with those lyrics, #1 
on the Billboard charts for nine 
straight weeks? How did listeners 
allow this to happen”?

Another one of most popular 

songs of 2017 was “Bad and 
Boujee” 
by 
the 
new-money 

Atlanta rap trio Migos. The song 
spent 36 weeks on Billboard 
Charts and skyrocketed the group 
into popular “Culture” (pun 
intended); however, the song is 
a misogynistic anthem. First of 
all, the title “Bad and Boujee” is 
a shortened version of Offset’s 
line “My b***h is bad and boujee”; 
this implies Offset’s ownership 
of a woman who he does not 
respect enough to call a woman, 
but rather a deprecating “bitch.” 
Second of all, the line “F*****g on 
your b***h she a thot, thot, thot” 
reinforces 
the 
objectification 

of these women as sex objects 
that are essentially being passed 
around among the rappers. There 
is no evidence of any respect for 
women, period. 

As a longtime and dedicated fan 

of hip hop, I have always been the 
first to defend my favorite music 
genre; however, my identity as a 
female has finally taken precedent. 
I used to look to rap lyrics as a 
source of confidence, but the more 
aware I become of the inequalities 
and 
sexual 
harassment 
that 

women face every day in this 
society, the more discouraged 
it makes me feel. I am deeply 
disappointed by the misogyny that 
continues to permeate hip hop. 
With the influence that rappers 
hold over popular culture, this 
behavior must come to a stop.

I now want to ask all music 

listeners: What do you think? 
Why are we still allowing this to 
happen? Do you feel okay rapping 
along to lyrics that degrade, insult, 
harass and objectify women? What 
kind of example are we setting by 
allowing this behavior to continue? 
We need more female leaders like 
Beyonce and Nicki Minaj. Women 
deserve to be treated equally in 
all industries, and hip hop has 
the ability to set the standard. 
We must hold these rappers to a 
higher moral standard in order for 
a society of consumers to do the

carlic@umich.edu.

Rappers must also 
face responsibility 

for their words 

and actions.

Most of my winter break 
played out to the tune of Phil 
Collins’s Face Value, his debut 
solo album released back in 
1981. My dad put it on repeat 
every morning and in car 
rides where he made me turn 

off my “DIY crap” and put on 
something easier on the ears. 
I chose Face Value knowing it 
would be the happy medium.
It’s 
a 
brilliant 
album. 
Delivering us the impenetrable 
“In the Air Tonight,” Collins 
places himself on the same 
playing field as his former 
Genesis 
bandmate 
Peter 
Gabriel with a record that 
encompasses the genres of 
progressive rock, pop and 
funk. From the slow build of 
“In the Air” to the rhythmic 
bassline of “Behind the Lines,” 
Collins places a punchy synth 
and gated reverb drums beside 
piano interludes like “The Roof 
is Leaking.” Horns raise you up 
on one song, while the pull of a 
sitar and African-styled drums 
bring you back down to earth 
on another. Collins can do no 
wrong on Face Value; it’s his 
untouchable work of art that 
explores unforeseen bounds 
in music while charting the 
demise of his marriage.

So it makes sense that 
Francis and the Lights is so 
frequently compared to the 
former drummer and later 
singer of Genesis. The sound 
Francis 
has 
championed 
since 2007 is reminiscent of 
great prog-rock bands like 
Genesis and innovative in its 
modern-day fusion of genres 
through 
production 
that 

wasn’t accessible in the ’80s. 
Not to mention, Francis’s voice 
sounds so much like Phil’s, 
plain and simple. What Collins 
began, Francis has perfected, 
and while Francis has so far 
avoided horns and banjos, 
the punchy feel of songs like 
“See Her Out (That’s Just 
Life),” the opening track of 
2016’s Farewell, Starlite!, has 
a similar effect as songs on 
Face Value. The opening notes 
bounce back and forth, rope 
you in and, if anything else, 
you want to see it out until the 
end.
Just like “See Her Out,” the 
opening notes of “Morning,” 
the first song off of Just For 
Us, pull us in. But this time, 
there’s a difference. While 
Farewell, Starlite! throws us 
into a whirlwind of synth, 
“Morning” is gentler, its piano 
slowly delivering us into the 
drums rather than bursting 
into them. And this time the 
piano is here to stay. “Morning” 

seems to be a continuation of 
the piano Francis used briefly 
in the song “Thank You” on 
Farewell, Starlite!, piano that 
I only wanted more of as the 
album drew to a close. But 
that’s the thing, the piano 
is what makes the song so 
crushingly 
beautiful, 
brief 
and bittersweet. An album 
that wasn’t necessarily tragic 

didn’t need the instrument 
that makes songs so.
Just For Us is different in 
this regard; the 26-minute 
album 
is 
sorrowful 
as 
it 
traces the slow demise of a 
relationship. The piano that 
draws us in takes various 
forms as the album, and the 
relationship, unfolds. But even 
as Francis sends us from the 
frigid snaps of “Morning” into 
the blaring synths of “Just For 
Us” and then back into the cool 
piano of “Faithful,” there’s a 
cohesive whole to the album. 
Sometimes it’s difficult to tell 
where one song starts and 
another ends. 
The transition from “I Won’t 
Lie to You” into “Breaking Up” 
is perhaps the most beautiful 
on 
the 
album 
and 
best 
exemplifies its cohesiveness. 
The brevity of the former, a one 
minute and 12-second track, 
leads into the latter, and the 
two are inseparable in story 
and in song. Outside of this, 

Losing myself in the
art culture of Ann Arbor

Francis and the Lights brings beauty on ‘Just for Us’

As with most college students, 
going back home for winter 
break after a long time away 
was a strange experience. I had 
been away from home for so 
long that I found it difficult to 
recall the fine details of my home 
without looking at pictures. 
More frightening was that the 
memories of the art culture 
of New York City that shaped 
who I was as a performer and a 
person ever since I was young 
started to blur, as I immersed 
myself in the new culture that 
Ann Arbor had to offer. I did not 
find myself longing for the art 
from New York City, but rather 
trying to find my place in the 
art of Ann Arbor. There seemed 
to be a hole in the culture that 
surrounded me — one that I could 
not pinpoint. Even though I had 
been told that college was about 
self-discovery, I felt I was losing 
myself as an artist and a person. 
When I finally did find myself, 
it was very unexpected. More 
importantly, I discovered the gap 
that I had been feeling and was 
unable to articulate until now.
Over winter break, my sister 
performed in a comedy improv 
show in order to raise money 
to help the hurricane victims 
in Puerto Rico, and she invited 
me to go see the performance. 
I walked into a small, grunge 
underground 
theater 
in 
the 
East Village, a neighborhood of 
Manhattan in New York City. 
The small black box theater was 
filled with plush, cloth seats 
that looked as if they had a high 

probability of being infested 
with bed bugs. The theater was 
packed with adults drinking 
coquito, a traditional Puerto 
Rican 
drink 
usually 
served 
around the holidays. The show 

was comprised of many short 
comedy skits that celebrated 
Puerto Rican traditions during 
the holidays. As salsa blasted 
from the speakers, it filled the 
room with a sound that I had 
been missing back in Ann Arbor. 
I had rediscovered my own sound 
and my own culture through this 
production — something I had no 
intention of doing when I walked 
through the doors of the theater.
My mind went back to the first 
time my mother took me to see 
“In the Heights” on Broadway. 
It is a musical that tells the story 
of the Latino community in a 
neighborhood called Washington 
Heights (also in Manhattan). 
Seeing my culture and my people 
represented and celebrated in “In 
the Heights” was too much for my 
eight-year-old mind to handle. 
Before then, I had only ever been 
exposed to people of my culture 
as gangster characters, such as in 
“West Side Story,” and even then 

they were not played by minority 
actors and actresses.
Being a dancer, I was sure that 
my Latina curves would hinder 
my success. Being an actress 
and a singer, I was sure that the 
pigment of my skin would cause 
me to look too ethnic for most 
lead roles. When the beauty of my 
culture and its people unfolded 
before my eyes on a Broadway 
stage, all of those insecurities 
instantly vanished. This was 
the same feeling I had in the 
— perhaps bed bug infested — 
theater in the East village. What 
I had really missed was having 
my culture represented in art, 
whether it be in music blasting 
from a storefront, or a bunch of 
teenagers rapping on a street 
corner.
Ann Arbor is a community 
that is vibrant in all kinds of art. 
To immerse yourself in the art 
is not hard to do; however, it is 
not a complete culture. I could 
not find myself in the culture 
of Ann Arbor because I am not 
there. My culture was no longer 
represented in the art that 
surrounded me.
I had to come to terms with the 
fact that it would be difficult for 
me to find a concert performed 
by my favorite salsa or merengue 
artist, and that YouTube is my 
best friend for re-discovering 
my identity as an artist and a 
performer. As a community, Ann 
Arbor needs to strive to celebrate 
the minority artist — not just 
during Black History month 
or Hispanic Heritage month. 
It is more important than ever 
to foster a community where 
everyone can find themselves in 
every form of art.

the songs, whether blending 
together or not, repeatedly 
refer back to one another. 
“Never Back” is the ending 
to “Back in Time” as Francis 
continues to pour over the 
inaccessible nature of the past, 
how everything that led him 
to this point is untouchable. 
This 
inaccessibility, 
the 
unavoidable nature of demise 
— it’s another layer of tragedy 
on a narrative that builds itself 
out of loss. 
Inaccessibility is a theme 
that permeates the album, 
for while Farewell, Starlite! 
offered up more to the listener 
with its substantial tracks and 
features from Kanye West 
and remixes with Chance the 
Rapper, Just For Us is stripped 
down, 
barren 
almost, 
and 
untouchable for those who 
don’t participate in its story. 
Perhaps this is why on first 
listen the album seemed less-
than; where I wanted to hear 
the jauntiness of songs like 
“May I Have This Dance,” 
there was only stripped down 
synth on “Tear It Up.” This 
isn’t to the album’s detriment; 
it is simply different, jarring to 
a degree on first listen.
But becoming a part of the 
story, a part of the album’s 
sadness and dwelling in its loss 
is what makes the listening 
experience dynamic. Reflexive 
in its self-referentiality, he 
invokes the parallels of God 
and 
belief, 
self-doubt 
and 

uncertainty to paint a full 
picture of everything that led 
to the relationship’s ultimate 
end, draping us in despair with 
simple lines like, “You could 
try to be gracious … You could 
try to be nice to me.” That 
simple sentiment is absolutely 
destructive 
in 
Francis’s 

feather-light voice. “Scream So 
Loud” best displays Francis’s 
signature minimalism, both in 
its lyrics and sound. 
All of this sadness, this 
progression of emotion that 
becomes 
overbearing 
on 

certain parts of the album, 
culminates in the album’s final 
song “Cruise” which acts as a 
release, a reckoning with the 
heavy emotion of the previous 
songs. Twenty-four minutes 
builds to this, and while we’re 
more 
emotionally 
wrecked 
than we were before starting 
the album, “Cruise” is what 
makes it all feel like catharsis 
rather than a funeral. In 
Francis’s 
own 
words, 
it’s 
“straight 
from 
the 
horse’s 
mouth,” entirely uncut and 
raw.
The 
unity 
of 
Francis’s 
mournful Just For Us is what 
places him on a plane separate 
from Face Value. While the 
sound is similar, the invocation 
of minimalism that pervades 
the album is individual to 
Francis and Francis alone. 
It’s his expertise, after all. 
But like Collins he fuses many 
methods in doing this, genre-
bending not only on a musical 
scale but a branding one. His 
ability to breed sadness while 
simultaneously 
transcending 
categorization 
as 
a 
sad 
songwriter with sad songs 
is seen in his latest business 
venture: “Morning,” the new 
theme for “Keeping Up with 
the Kardashians.” And so we’re 
left asking the same question 
people asked of Phil Collins, 
Peter Gabriel and the entire 
brand Genesis built on doing 
the unexpected — Francis, 
who and what are you?

Before moving to Netflix from 
Britain’s Channel 4, “Lovesick” 
was originally named “Scrotal 
Recall,” a title so laughable and 
eye-rolling it suggested the worst 
qualities of a television rom-
com. Even the premise seemed 
slight: A young Englishman 
named Dylan (Johnny Flynn, 
“Genius”) must seek out all 
the women he slept with after 
discovering he has chlamydia. 
But don’t let the original title and 
premise downplay its potential: 
“Lovesick” is a remarkable gem 
of a show. 
With a neat balance between 
snappy humor and poignant 
drama, “Lovesick” comes into its 
own in its third season. Creator 
Tom Edge (“The Crown”) has 
crafted yet another array of 
episodes that will make you 
cringe, laugh and contemplate 
your own perception of love in 
the 21st century.
After reconciling with his 
girlfriend 
Abigail 
(Hannah 
Britland, 
“Rush”), 
Dylan 
struggles to conceal his feelings 
for his best friend Evie (Antonia 
Thomas, “The Good Doctor”), a 
will-they-won’t-they 
romance 
that’s as intensely complicated as 
Ross and Rachel’s. Meanwhile, 
Dylan’s other friends — the 
extroverted, philandering Luke 
(Daniel Ings, “Instinct”) and 
the neurotic, sprightly Angus 
(Joshua McGuire, “Cinderella”) 
— find themselves in their own 

romantic entanglements. And 
unlike the previous two seasons, 
which depicted Dylan’s doomed 
affairs with women that led to his 
STD, season three of “Lovesick” 
focuses more on the roots of 
Dylan and Evie’s relationship, 
and how it has blossomed over 
time.

The most refreshing aspect 
of “Lovesick,” and especially 
with this season, is that the 
subject matter is so utterly real 
and 
unapologetically 
honest. 
Underneath all of its whip-
smart dialogue and zany cringe 
comedy, there is such heart 
within each character and their 
relationships to one another. 
The tricky conflict that stirs 
between Dylan and Evie — they 
love each other, but don’t want to 
ruin a good friendship — never 
feels flat. Thomas and Flynn’s 
performances 
and 
magnetic 
chemistry 
help 
capture 
the 
muddiness and awkwardness of 
their characters’ conundrum. 
Luke 
and 
Angus 
also 
get 
wonderful subplots this season: 
Luke learns that he wants more 
in a relationship than just a one-
night fling, while Angus worries 
about starting his future with his 
pregnant fiancée Holly (Klariza 
Clayton, “Fox Trap”).
The show isn’t afraid to get 

into the nitty-gritty of how our 
desire for connection informs 
our desperation for love, or how 
our past experiences shape our 
present 
anxieties. 
Everyone, 
even the supporting characters, 
gets a nuanced personal journey.
What’s even more alluring 
about “Lovesick” is that it adds 
a rare layer of depth that other 
similar romantic sitcoms have 
mostly failed to consistently 
uphold. “Lovesick” mirrors the 
extended flashback format of 
“How I Met Your Mother,” but 
devotes more time to fleshing out 
character arcs than maintaining 
running gags. It shares the 
dysfunction 
of 
“You’re 
the 
Worst” but without any of the 
misanthropy. The young cast 
of 
“Lovesick” 
channels 
the 
charismatic, 
hyper-specific 
appeal of “Friends,” and, while 
they haven’t reached icon status 
yet, Dylan, Luke, Angus and Evie 
are certainly on their way.
Had “Lovesick” been made 
by the wrong hands — or even 
maintained its original title 
— it could’ve easily ended up 
yet another formulaic, cheesy 
and grating show about young 
20-somethings figuring their shit 
out. It could’ve kept the cookie-
cutter qualities of its archetypal 
characters 
— 
the 
insecure 
protagonist, the womanizing best 
friend, the nebbish acquaintance 
and the manic pixie dream 
girl love interest. Lucky for us, 
“Lovesick” is not that kind of 
show, as its third (and hopefully 
not final) season is a testament to 
streaming sitcoms.

Any travel guide, book, any 
piece of media at all about 
Brazil will tell you that the 
country 
lives 
and 
breathes 
music and art. After all, it’s the 
country of samba, bossa nova, 
flamboyant soccer players who 
don’t just play the game, but 
elevate it into an art. Through 
this 
reputation, 
Brazilian 
musicians such as João Gilberto 
and Antônio Carlos Jobim have 
enticed people around the world 
with the rhythmic, easy-going 
nature of genres such as bossa 
nova and tropicália. Milton 
Nascimento’s Clube da Esquina 
is less appreciated outside of 
Brazil than many other similarly 
important Brazilian albums, but 
is one of the finest collections of 
pop songs I have ever heard.
Clube da Esquina (“corner 
club”) titled after Nascimento’s 
musical collective formed in 
the 1970s in the mountainous, 
mineral-rich Brazilian state of 
Minas Gerais (which is featured 
in 
an 
episode 
of 
Anthony 
Bourdain’s excellent TV show 
“Parts Unknown”). It featured 
Milton Nascimento, a musician 
originally from Rio and Lô 
Borges, another iconic Brazilian 
musician, as well as some of the 
country’s most talented session 
musicians. Despite not coming 
from some of the country’s 
more glamourous regions, the 
collective’s 
first, 
self-titled 
double album eventually found 
its way into the forefront of 
Brazilian music.
Clube da Esquina is referred to 
as an example of a genre known 

as “Música popular brasileira” 
(Brazilian popular music), but in 
reality, it’s nearly impossible to 
pin down the album to a specific 
genre. While all the songs feature 
distinctly Brazilian rhythms and 
instrumentation, the influences 
present on the record are all 
over the map. “Tudo o Que 
Você Podia Ser” kicks off the 
record with excellent guitar 
work and a meandering vocal 
line from Nascimento, before 
breaking into a groovy ending 
from the entire band with 
Nascimento crying out on top. 
Two of the songs written by 
Borges, “O Trem Azul” and my 
personal favorite, “Um Girassol 
da Cor do Seu Cabelo” are 
rather Beatles-esque, with the 
latter featuring a memorable 
orchestral breakdown similar 
to “A Day in the Life.” “Nuvem 
Cigana” features dreamy guitars 
accompanied by violins and 
brass. Throughout the record, 
one can hear influences ranging 
from as far as progressive rock 
to jazz.
Another 
album 
I 
was 
constantly reminded of while 
listening to this record for the 
first time was The Beach Boys’ 
Pet Sounds. Both are musically 
ornate and lush, eschewing 
the 
sole 
usage 
of 
guitars, 
pianos and drums for grand, 
orchestral 
flourishes, 
adding 
an entirely new dimension of 
richness. Borges’s fondness for 
Anglophone popular music is 
evident often, making Clube 
da Esquina a great example of 
popular fusion.
Although 
the 
lyrics 
are 
notably poetic and a large 
part of what makes the album 

legendary in Brazilian music, I 
found that not understanding 
Portuguese was not a major 
hindrance 
in 
enjoying 
the 
record (and speakers of any 
Romance language should be 
able to understand part of it). 
It helps that Portuguese itself, 
especially the Brazilian variety, 
is such an inherently musical 
language. As to be expected 
with a Romance language, it 
flows extremely well and lacks 
many of the guttural consonants 
that make some languages such 
as 
German 
“unattractive.” 
Even conversational Brazilian 
Portuguese 
seems 
to 
have 
a set of lovely shifts in tone 
and 
natural 
elongation 
of 
vowels. Even if you know zero 
Portuguese, simply listening to 
the vocals and the language is 
a rather pleasant experience, 
especially with Nascimento’s 
smooth-as-butter voice gliding 
over the instrumentation and 
rarely stagnating in one dynamic 
level or tone.
Clube 
da 
Esquina 
sounds 
like the perfect soundtrack to 
a pleasant dream or to a lazy 
Sunday afternoon at the beach 
or park. The songs are pleasant 
yet tinged with melancholy, for 
those relaxing yet reflective 
moments where you are content 
with life, but perhaps indulging 
in nostalgia or remembering 
people from a past life. While 
not particularly revolutionary 
or exotic, it is a near-perfect 
collection of songs with top-
class musical talent featured at 
every level. There are few better 
albums to embark on a journey 
with into the endless ocean of 
world music.

‘The Shape of Water’ is 
spellbinding in few words

For a movie centered around a 
woman who does not speak, “The 
Shape of Water” has a strong voice. 
Elisa (Sally Hawkins, “Maudie”) 
is a mute cleaning lady at a 
research facility in the 1960s. She 
lives a lonely life, mostly limiting 
her interactions to her closeted 
neighbor Giles (Richard Jenkins, 
“Step Brothers”) and coworker 
Zelda (Octavia Spencer, “Hidden 
Figures”). One day a mysterious 
specimen arrives at the facility 
along with an uber-masculine 
security 
officer, 
Richard 
Strickland 
(Michael 
Shannon, 
“Nocturnal Animals”). Elisa offers 
the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones, 
“Hellboy”) — nicknamed the 
Asset — kindness and friendship 
and, in return, he provides the 
companionship she misses. When 
Cold War pressures threaten the 
Amphibian Man’s life, Elisa takes 
the matter into her own hands 
with people who feel a moral 
calling to help.
“The Shape of Water” has 
breathtaking cinematography that 
sets the fantastical mood. Director 
Guillermo 
Del 
Toro 
(“Pan’s 
Labyrinth”) uses visual elements 
to give a voice to two characters 
who do not speak, Elisa and the 
Amphibian Man. The clever use of 
water to connect scenes creates a 

flow to the film as it weaves among 
the many sides that want control 

of the unknown specimen and its 
suspected powers. Del Toro also 
immerses the characters in old-
timey films, settings and music to 
add to the romantic atmosphere.
The soundtrack draws from 
classics like “You’ll Never Know” 
from the 1943 movie “Hello, 
Frisco, Hello” and other nostalgic 
songs. At times, “The Shape 
of Water” plays like a musical, 
complete with tapdance numbers 
and a re-creation of the famous 
dance between Ginger Rogers 
and Fred Astaire. Despite limited 
dialogue from its main character, 
the film is still able to capture 
the sentimental tone of a musical 
without 
the 
constrictions 
of 
needing to break into song and 
dance every other scene.
Since Elisa and the Amphibian 
Man speak through sign language, 
the supporting cast provides the 
humor, fills the empty spaces 
with words and gives helpful 
interpretations of Elisa’s gestures. 
Zelda and Giles give insight into 

Elisa’s quiet demeanor, shielding 
her innocent and good intentions 
from evil forces. Every heartfelt 
motion from Elisa is matched with 
a well-timed quip from her two 
friends. To balance out these kind-
hearted 
characters, 
Shannon’s 
Strickland brings all the bearings 
of toxic masculinity and abuse 
of power. Shannon exudes this 
toxicity with every calculating 
stare and bite of his ever-present 
green candies. 
The supporting cast does a 
tremendous job, but the majority 
of credit goes to Sally Hawkins and 
her spell-binding performance. 
Unlike 
previous 
actors 
who 
have played disabled characters, 
Hawkins turns Elisa’s muteness 
into a strength, not a pantomime 
— using her hand motions to 
emphasize the tenderness and 
courage of this woman. Purely 
through facial expressions and 
physical actions, Hawkins conveys 
the loneliness of an outcast and 
the joy of finding camaraderie in 
unexpected corners of the world. 
In fact, “The Shape of Water” 
should serve as a playbook for 
how to treat “others”: with love, 
kindness and an open mind. This 
message coupled with outstanding 
filmmaking is why the final scene 
will leave everyone breathless 
with its pureness and beauty — 
enough to believe for a second that 
nothing evil could ever touch this 
Earth again.

ASCENDING

F

ifth-year senior 
guard Jaaron 
Simmons 
maneuvered out 
of a crowded paint 
area, looked up 

and saw freshman guard Jordan 
Poole sprinting down the court. 
Simmons fired a laser to Poole, 
who casually lofted the ball in the 
direction of the hoop. 

“I got the pass and I kinda 

peeped (Isaiah Livers) at half 
court,” Poole said. “We made eye 
contact, so I’m looking like ‘I’m 
gonna throw it to the rim, big boy, 
you gotta go get it.’ ”

With an emphatic alley-oop 

flush, Livers — Poole’s roommate 
— erased Michigan’s early 
doldrums to give the Wolverines 
the boost it needed, en route to a 
79-69 win over Illinois.

A multitude of mistakes — 
turnovers, fouls, missed shots 

— dug Michigan an early 

hole, though. Redshirt 

sophomore wing 

Charles Matthews 

picked up a foul 

away from the 

ball just 16 

seconds 
into the 
game. Junior 
center Moritz 
Wagner made a three-
point bucket, then turned 
the 

ball over and committed an 
unnecessary foul on the other 
end immediately after. Both 
fouls relegated Michigan’s two 
stars to the bench before the 
first timeout.

And just seconds after 

checking back in, Matthews 
picked up an offensive foul, 
forcing an uncharacteristically 
angry John Beilein to bring 

Poole back in. Matthews, 

Michigan’s leading scorer 

on the year, played only 

one first-half minute.

But led by a storm 
of energy from the 

freshman duo of 
Poole and Livers, 
Michigan crawled 
back to eventually 
grab the lead late 
in the half. The 
two combined 
for 14 of the 
team’s 31 
points in the 

half, despite 
neither 
starting 

the game.

Robinson also pitched in with 

nine points in the first half. 

“I was really pleased,” Beilein 

said when asked about his message 
at halftime. “That was my message 
to the team. I didn’t go in there 
ranting and raving. I just said, 
‘Look, I feel in a really good place 
that we’re down three right now.’ 
We got used to it a little bit. You 
know, we tried to simulate it for 
the last two days, and our scout 
team just doesn’t have that length 
and that quickness. So it hit us 
right in the face, and then we had 
to react to it. Don’t blame our guys, 
credit Illinois. They did a great 
job.”

The Wolverines shook off the 

first half woes quickly, starting the 
second half with a game-altering 
9-2 spurt to give Michigan a lead it 
would keep for good.

Wagner and Matthews struggled 

with foul trouble throughout — 
each picking up a third foul less 
than five minutes into the second 
half. But Poole and Livers were 
able to shoulder much of the load, 
combining for 23 points on just 10 
shots. 

Senior guard Muhammad-

Ali Abdur-Rahkman added 13 
points of his own, all coming in 
the second half. Six Wolverines 
finished in double figures.

“I don’t think there’s anything 

pretty about how we’re playing,” 
Beilein said. “At the same time 
we’re just finding ways still to 
get out in front of people and win 
games.”

Though he only played 22 

minutes due to foul trouble, 
Wagner showed signs of shaking 
the rust that has led to struggles 
since returning from an ankle 
injury a week ago. He scored 14 
points on an efficient 6-of-7 from 
the field.

Though they struggled at times 

— setting a new season-high 
with 14 turnovers — the strong 
second half proved to be too 

much, earning Michigan its third 
conference win of the season.

“(In the) second half, I’m so 

proud of the way we played,” 
Beilein said. “We had 12 turnovers 
in the first half, three in the 
second half. There’s the difference 
in the game.”

A week to make believers

J

ohn Beilein has a theory. 
He’s just not entirely sold 
on it yet.

It came to light after his 

Michigan 
basketball 
team notched 
a 79-69 win 
over Illinois 
on Saturday 
afternoon. 
The victory, 
by Beilein’s 
own self 
admission, 
wasn’t pretty.

Redshirt 

sophomore wing Charles Mat-
thews played 67 seconds in the 
first half due to foul trouble. 
Junior center Moritz Wagner 
didn’t fare much better, picking 
up two fouls of his own. The 
duo combined for three first-
half points, and the Wolverines 
turned the ball over 12 times 
in the frame against an Illinois 
team that ranks sixth nation-
ally in forced turnovers.

And yet, Michigan man-

aged to right the ship anyway. 
Freshmen Jordan Poole and 
Isaiah Livers found themselves 
on the court with just under 
nine minutes left, turning in 
the game of their dreams. A 
3-pointer, two dunks, an alley-
oop and five 
free throws 
later, the Wol-
verines found 
themselves up 
by two — lucky 
to eventu-
ally exit the 
half trailing by 
three.

After the 

early foul trou-
ble, Wagner and 
Matthews finally found sound 
footing, and the Wolverines 
outlasted a vaunted defensive 
unit to shoot 64 percent from 
the floor in the second half. 
Michigan finished with six 
players scoring in double dig-
its, two of whom —Poole and 

Livers — came off the bench.

Quite simply, the Wolver-

ines found a way to make a 
ramshackle unit survive long 

enough to win. 
The produc-
tion, as it has 
all season, came 
from different 
characters in no 
logical order.

But with 

matchups 
against No. 13 
Purdue and No. 
1 Michigan State 
in the coming 

week, Beilein was asked if he 
wants to see one of his players 
become ‘the guy.’ His answer 
was illuminating.

“I think it’s important that 

those guys continue to estab-
lish a rhythm when everyone’s 
in a new role,” he said. “I don’t 

think it’s essential that they 
have to be stars for us to win, 
as you can see today. I think 
there’s enough guys out there 
that can make shots.”

Still, there was some doubt.
“That’s our hope,” he con-

tinued. “Now we’ll find out, 
and I’ll be a believer when I 
know that we’re rebounding 
and we’re better in the post 
defense. If we can beat the 
Purdues and the Michigan 
States, alright, then I’m gonna 
probably be a believer that 
we’re okay.”

Hope is the operative word, 

and therein lies the crux of 
this entire week. On paper, the 
Wolverines are okay, boasting 
14 wins in 17 games.

Michigan, of course, has star 

power in Wagner and Mat-
thews. Both can take over a 
game, though neither has on 

a consistent basis. The same 
fluctuations apply to Muham-
mad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman and 
Duncan Robinson.

Poole and 

Livers, for 
their part, have 
shown an ability 
to fill in when 
those fluc-
tuations cause 
trouble. In other 
cases, they’ve 
shown the oppo-
site, though 
there has been 
more of the for-
mer as of late.

And Zavier Simpson, who 

started for the first time in 
12 games Saturday, seems to 
be rounding out the bunch at 
point guard — though Beilein 
wouldn’t go as far to say his 
starting nod was a definitive 

answer.

This all goes to say that their 

collective identity, it appears, 
just may work out.

But now it’s 

time to find out 
for good.

Purdue will 

visit Crisler 
Center on Tues-
day, providing 
the Wolverines 
with their first 
opportunity 
to notch a win 
over a top-25 
team. 

Four days later, Michigan 

will seek its first road win 
over its in-state rivals since 
2014 when it heads to East 
Lansing. 

The Boilermakers’ Isaac 

Haas and Vincent Edwards 
await, while Miles Bridges is 

only the tip of the iceberg on a 
loaded Spartans roster.

The only team that Michi-

gan has faced that can evenly 
remotely compare to the chal-
lenge ahead is North Carolina, 
which ran the Wolverines out 
of the gym.

The Wolverines have come 

a long way since that Nov. 29 
matchup in Chapel Hill — win-
ning eight of their last nine.

And after the most recent 

win, Illinois coach Brad 
Underwood seemed to confirm 
as much.

“That’s a really good Michi-

gan basketball team,” he said. 
“They’ve proven that with 
who they’ve beat and who they 
played.”

Underwood, more than 

most, can offer a sound outsid-
er’s perspective on where this 
team stands. The Wolverines 
beat his Oklahoma State team 
in the NCAA Tournament last 
year. Asked about how this 
iteration of Michigan com-
pares to last year’s, Under-
wood pointed to the seemingly 
obvious.

“Well it starts at the point,” 

he said. “And I’m not down-
playing Zavier or any of their 
other guys, but when we 
played them in the tourna-
ment, Walton was playing as 
well as any point guard in 
America. … But they’re a lot 
of the same characters, do the 
same things.”

“Characters,” it would 

seem, is an accurate noun for 
a Michigan team that has yet 
to see a star emerge. Beilein 
thinks those “characters” may 
just be enough, but isn’t sold 
just yet.

Which brings us back to this 

week.

The Wolverines have a 

chance to make some believ-
ers. Their coach included.

Michigan coach John Beilein believes that he will learn a lot about his Michigan basketball team in its next two games against Purdue and Michigan State.

“I think there’s 

enough guys out 

there that can 

make shots.”

The Wolverines 
have a chance 
to make some 

believers.

Livers and Poole have the game of their dreams

Isaiah Livers said that he and 

Jordan Poole have dreamed about 
games like Saturday.

Each of the roommates has had 

their own breakout games — Poole 
dropped 19 points on Indiana and 
Livers had 13 against Iowa — but 
the pair had yet to go off in the 
same game.

Against Illinois, in a 79-69 win, 

that changed. And not only did the 
freshmen do it in the same game, 
but in the same portion of the 
game, to keep Michigan in it.

Livers checked in for the first 

time at the 8:52 mark in the first 
half. The Wolverines trailed by 
eight. Two minutes later, they 
were still down eight. That’s when 
Livers and Poole got going.

First, Livers hit a corner three 

to cut it to five.

Then, 
when 
the 
Fighting 

Illini 
tried 
to 
trap 
senior 

guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-
Rahkman, Livers snuck toward 
the 
basket, 
where 
Abdur-

Rahkman found him for an open 
dunk.

Another Livers dunk moments 

later came from similar action, 
and the freshman had put together 
a personal 7-0 run.

It’s a far cry from where Livers 

was even a few games ago.

“I was thinking way too much 

a month ago,” Livers said. “Just, 
‘should I shoot this, or should 
I pass it.’ Now I feel like Coach 
(Beilein) trusts that I have the 
green light to shoot the ball or go 
to the basket any time I want to.”

After Livers’ run, Illinois made 

a basket, and it was time for Poole 
to get in on the action. He was 
fouled on a three of his own, and 
he promptly drilled his three free 
throws to tie the game.

Moments later, Michigan took 

the lead on the best example of 
Livers and Poole’s chemistry.

Fifth-year senior guard Jaaron 

Simmons tossed an outlet pass 
to Poole, who was already in the 
frontcourt. A defender stood 
between Poole and the basket, and 
he took a step toward Poole. What 
the defender didn’t see was Livers 
running the floor on the opposite 
side. Poole didn’t hesitate.

He slowed down at the 3-point 

line and lobbed the ball toward 
the hoop. Livers went and got it, 

threw it down, and sent Crisler 
Center into hysterics.

“We made eye contact,” Livers 

said. “That’s my roommate, we 
made eye contact. I knew at half 
court, he was gonna slow down 
and throw it up.”

Added Poole: “I remember 

last time I threw an alley-oop to 
him, he wanted me to throw it 
higher. So at that point, it’s like, 
‘I’m gonna throw it up, you’ve got 
to go get it.’ It was a huge energy-
bringer to Crisler that got us going 
a little bit.”

Poole would add two free 

throws at the 3:22 mark, giving 
the duo a combined 14-4 runt 
that propelled the Wolverines to a 
27-25 lead.

It was a crucial run for a 

Michigan team whose leading 
scorer — redshirt sophomore 
guard Charles Matthews — had 
picked up two quick fouls to start 
the game.

It could also be crucial for the 

Wolverines in the future. Poole 
and Livers seem to be getting more 
comfortable with every game, and 
their combined 23 points against 
Illinois was another data point 
that hints at their development. 

They’ve shown that they can pick 
up the slack when Matthews and 
junior forward Moritz Wagner 
have off nights or get in foul 
trouble. Saturday was just the 
latest example of that.

The game also served as an 

example of just how good the pair 
can be together.

“I mean, I wake up and I see 

him all the time,” Poole said. “So, 
when I go out there, and I just see a 
big human being like that running 
to the rim, I just throw it up. So I 
feel like, definitely, spending as 
much time as we do together is a 
huge connection on the court.”

After the game, in the media 

room, Poole finished answering 
questions 
before 
Livers. 
He 

walked over to his roommate, took 
a microphone, and asked Livers 
what he thought about the alley-
oop pass.

Livers smiled and said he 

thought he might owe the passer 
some food.

Then, the pair left and took 

pictures with fans outside the 
room. It was all smiles for them 
after the day they had. After all, 
it’s a game Livers and Poole have 
been dreaming about.

Report: ‘M’ set to hire 
former Arkansas OC 

Michigan 
officially 

announced the hiring of one 
assistant coach, Al Washington, 
this past weekend. And it 
may not be too long before 
the Wolverines officially hire 
another assistant as the college 
football 
coaching 
carousel 

continues to turn.

According to a report from 

Bruce Feldman 
of 
Sports 

Illustrated 
on 
Friday 

afternoon, 
Michigan 
is 

set 
to 
hire 

Dan 
Enos, 

previously 
Arkansas’ 
offensive 
coordinator.

Enos 

has been connected to the 
Wolverines in recent weeks. 
A Dec. 7 report from Football 
Scoop stated that Jim Harbaugh 
had been in contact with Enos 
about a position on his staff.

Enos, 
a 

native 
of 

Dearborn, has 
spent 
much 

of his career 
working within 
the 
state 
— 

especially 
at 
Michigan 

State, 
where 

he played four 
years at as a 
quarterback.

After his playing career, 

Enos began coaching as a 
graduate assistant with the 
Spartans for three seasons. 
He made stops at Lakeland, 
Northern Michigan, Southern 
Illinois and Missouri State 
before returning to his home 
state as Western Michigan’s 
quarterbacks coach.

Following stops at North 

Dakota State and Cincinnati, 
Enos then joined his alma 
mater’s staff. He was Michigan 
State’s quarterbacks coach in 

2006 and the running backs 
coach from 2007-2009.

Enos then began his first 

and only stint as a head coach 
at Central Michigan, where he 
compiled a 26-36 record over 
five seasons. He made waves in 
the offseason of 2014 when he 
decided to leave the Chippewas 
to 
become 
the 
offensive 

coordinator 
at 
Arkansas, 

where he spent the past three 

seasons coaching 
before being let 
go 
along 
with 

the rest of Bret 
Bielema’s 
staff 

this offseason.

While 
in 

East 
Lansing, 

Enos cultivated 
a 
reputation 

as 
a 
talented 

recruiter. 
He 

was responsible 

for many of Michigan State’s 
in-state recruiting victories, 
signing players such as Edwin 
Baker, Chris Norman, Fred 
Smith, Dion Sims, Tyler Hoover, 
Bennie Fowler and Keshawn 

Martin.

It 
remains 

unknown 
what 
Enos’s 

official 
role 

on 
Michigan’s 

staff 
will 
be. 

Offensive 
tackles and tight 
ends coach Greg 
Frey 
appears 

to be taking a 
similar role with 

Florida State; meanwhile, the 
Wolverines still have offensive 
coordinator 
Tim 
Drevno, 

running 
backs 
coach 
Jay 

Harbaugh and quarterbacks 
coach Pep Hamilton on staff as 
of now.

While Enos has experience 

with calling plays, there would 
need to be some shuffling along 
Michigan’s staff for him to do so 
in Ann Arbor. This season, the 
Wolverines split play-calling 
duties 
amongst 
Harbaugh, 

Drevno and Hamilton.

Barnes Arico breaks all-time win record

When the seconds ticked 

off and the game ended last 
Thursday for the 190th time in 
Kim Barnes Arico’s time as head 
coach of the Michigan women’s 
basketball team, the first face 
she saw was a familiar one: 
Danielle Williams.

Williams has been under 

Barnes Arico’s tutelage since 
the 2013-14 season, as both 
a player and — starting this 
season — a graduate assistant. 
Instead of saying a familiar 
axiom or giving a high-five after 
the team’s 80-57 dismantling 
of Wisconsin, Williams offered 
up a hug. Barnes Arico had won 
her 124th game, making her the 
program’s all-time winningest 
coach. Congratulations were in 
order.

The team gifted Barnes Arico 

a jersey, numbered ‘124,’ with 
her name on the back of it — an 
idea birthed by Mulligan and 
Sarah VanMetre, the team’s 
communications director. Prior 
to Michigan’s game against 
Ohio State on Saturday, the 
jersey was presented to her at 
midcourt.

From 
there, 
the 

congratulatory 
messages 

poured in. Nearly 18 hours after 
the game ended, she had yet to 

sift through her text messages 
because there were too many.

When Barnes Arico took 

over at Michigan in 2012, the 
Wolverines 
were 
a 
veteran 

program, 
led 
by 
then-

seniors Jenny Ryan and Kate 
Thompson. 
After 
they 
left, 

however, it was Barnes Arico’s 
job 
to 
facilitate 
a 
rebuild 

while keeping Michigan in the 
postseason — something that 
hadn’t been done successfully in 
the program’s recent history.

She did it. For four straight 

seasons, she kept the Wolverines 
above .500 and got to the 
Women’s National Invitational 
Tournament, winning it in 2017 
and raising the team’s first ever 
banner.

“I was fortunate to inherit 

a group of seniors that was 
experienced 
and 
was 
a 

tremendous 
group,” 
Barnes 

Arico said. “But after that, and 
they graduated, we had a lot of 
young, inexperienced kids. So 
we figured, we were gonna work 
harder than everybody else. And 
we might not have the talent of 
other teams, but we were gonna 
be the hardest workers and that 
would prove to be successful.”

That ultimately became her 

theme, taken into every practice 
and every game. At the end of 
the intro video the team plays at 
the start of every contest, senior 

guard Katelynn Flaherty stares 
into the camera and says, “We 
are the hardest working team in 
America.”

“I 
just 
think 
sometimes, 

especially when you’re starting 
as an underdog and maybe 
your tradition has not been 
established already, to control 
the things that you can control, 
and one is your work ethic,” 
Barnes Arico said. “And the 
intensity and passion that you 
bring to your profession every 
day, whether that’s a player 
on the court or a coach on our 
staff.”

Now — in Barnes Arico’s 

fifth year in Ann Arbor — she’s 
no longer coaching a band of 
underdogs. 
The 
Wolverines 

have been nationally ranked 
since the season began and 
look poised to make a return to 
the NCAA Tournament for the 
first time since Barnes Arico’s 
inaugural season.

When asked if she thinks 

this is the best team she’s had at 
Michigan, Barnes Arico replied: 
“I guess the rest of the world 
does.”

As for herself, well, she didn’t 

give a concrete answer. Better 
to keep working than start 
wondering.

Wolverines fall short to Ohio State in overtime

With her team in the lead just six 

minutes into the game, Ohio State 
guard Kelsey Mitchell dribbled the 
ball calmly at the top of the key.

Junior guard Nicole Munger 

and junior center Hallie Thome 
closed in on her, catching her by 
surprise and forcing a loose ball. As 
the ball bounced past the half-court 
line, the three players chased it. 
Mitchell was the frontrunner of the 
pack, and it seemed as if she would 
regain possession.

But then, out of nowhere, 

Munger and Thome dove across the 
floor just as Mitchell reached down 
towards the ball. Thome grabbed 
the ball, and Munger instantly 
called a timeout — winning 
possession back for her team.

Some 
may 
have 
wondered 

why two starters would sacrifice 
themselves so early on.

But 
in 
Sunday 
afternoon’s 

overtime thriller, every possession 
mattered. The No. 22 Michigan 
women’s basketball team (2-2 Big 
Ten, 13-4 overall) fell to the tenth-
ranked Buckeyes (4-0, 15-2), 78-71, 
at Crisler Center.

The game started out intense, 

with both teams showing off their 
energy and physicality. Munger 

drained a corner 3, getting the 
Wolverines on the scoreboard 
early on. But Mitchell responded 
immediately for the Buckeyes, 
sinking a 3-pointer of her own.

The rest of the quarter — and 

game for that matter — would 
follow this back-and-forth trend.

Both 
teams 
created 
a 

considerable amount of scoring 
chances. Ohio State played very 
tight defense overall, especially on 
Katelynn Flaherty, but the senior 
guard still managed to find the rim 
from the get-go.

Thome 
was 
also 
a 
major 

contributor for Michigan. The 
Wolverines consistently fed her 
the ball down low, letting her spin 
around defenders to find the basket 
with ease. Michigan figured out 
how to capitalize on her height 
advantage from the beginning, and 
she put it in effect at the end of the 
first quarter.

Following a missed 3-pointer 

from Munger, a Buckeye defender 
waited under the rim for the 
rebound. But Thome suddenly 
reached 
over 
the 
opponent, 

grabbed the ball and scored.

Despite their offensive success, 

the Wolverines couldn’t limit Ohio 
State’s offense. They also had 
numerous traveling violations, and 

due to these mistakes Michigan 
trailed, 24-18, at the end of the 
opening stanza.

The second quarter was a 

defensive battle in which the 
Wolverines came out on top, 
limiting the Buckeyes to just six 
points. Senior forward Jillian 
Dunston set the tone for Michigan 
in this period, offering leadership 
through her confident style of play. 
The Wolverines followed suit and 
began cutting into Ohio State’s 
lead.

Having just hit a free throw to 

get her team within one, freshman 
guard Deja Church received the 
ball once more, following a missed 
jumper by Mitchell. Church’s 
floater — the last shot of the half — 
spun out of the hoop, though, and 
Michigan trailed, 30-29.

Flaherty made a jumper at the 

start of the second half, giving 
the Wolverines their first lead in a 
while. This lead flipped between 
the two sides seven more times 
in what was an even-sided third 
quarter.

With 19 seconds remaining 

in the quarter, Flaherty came up 
clutch for Michigan. She showed off 
her ball-handling skills, dribbling 
through the defense to convert a 
layup and tie the game at 47 at the 

end of the third frame.

Neither team pulled away in 

the fourth quarter. Thome found 
success in the low post, leading 
the Wolverines’ offense with a 
quarter-high nine points, while 
Mitchell continued to lead the 
Buckeyes.

With a little over a minute in 

regulation remaining, Michigan — 
trailing 62-61 — called a timeout. It 
proved helpful. Flaherty drained a 
3-pointer shortly after to give the 
Wolverines a two-point lead.

After a missed jumper by 

Ohio State, Michigan regained 
possession and had a chance to 
make it a two-possession game. But 
Flaherty missed a 3-pointer and 
Mitchell capitalized, going coast-
to-coast to tie the game at 64.

The Wolverines called a timeout 

with twelve seconds left, and 
had one final chance to put the 
game away. But Flaherty couldn’t 
convert, missing another 3-pointer, 
sending the game to overtime.

With 
Thome 
and 
Flaherty 

well-guarded, Michigan’s offense 
struggled in overtime. Deadlier, 
however, 
was 
its 
defense’s 

continued inability to stop Mitchell, 
who scored nine of her game-high 
37 points in the extra period.

Though the Wolverines had 

strong individual efforts — which 
included 27 and 22 points from 
Thome and Flaherty, respectively 
— they were not enough for a 
victory.

Michigan put together four 

strong quarters, but the end result 
left the fans feeling bitter once 
again. The Wolverines have yet to 
close out a game against a high-
caliber team.

“In general, we just need to 

realize we are right there,” Thome 
said. “We all need to go back, watch 
the game, figure out what we need 
to improve upon and then we play 
them next week, so we are in a good 
condition right now. We just need 
to keep improving and take it day 
by day. It’s a loss, but a loss is time 
for learning.”

In season-opening win, 
‘M’ passes difficult test 

For the No. 7 Michigan 

women’s 
gymnastics 
team, 

facing the best competition has 
become the norm. The prestige 
of the program has invited in 
competition from top talent 
across the nation.

This 
season 
alone, 
the 

Wolverines will face three of 
the top five teams ranked in the 
NACGC/W Preseason Coaches 
Poll. Friday, Michigan began 
its difficult schedule against 
fourth-ranked Alabama at the 
Crisler Center.

In a meet filled with a bevy of 

highs and lows, the Wolverines 
escaped with a narrow win, 
topping 
the 
Crimson 
Tide, 

196.200 to 195.675. Highlighting 
Michigan’s 
victory 
were 

individual performances from 
junior Olivia Karas on her floor 
routine and senior Briana Brown 
on the uneven bars, scoring 9.925 
and 9.900, respectively.

“We knew it was a really tough 

team,” Brown said. “But we’ve 
been working really hard and 
we’ve beaten Alabama before so 
we knew if we just trusted our 
training, if we just came out here 
and did what we knew how to do, 
it was gonna be just fine, and we 
had a lot of fun.”

The importance of competing 

against top-ranked opponents 
early and often is not lost on 
Michigan coach Bev Plocki, who 
places a special emphasis on 
scheduling the best of the best.

“I have always been of the 

belief that you are only as good as 
the teams you compete against,” 
Plocki said. “And the last couple 
years — this is not out of the 
norm for us. I really feel like you 
have to put yourself up against 
the best as a measuring stick.”

Now 
that 
Plocki 
has 

successfully lined up a laundry 
list of difficult opponents, the 

team’s preparation and energy 
must rise to that same elite level.

For these gymnasts, they will 

take that energy wherever they 
can get it, whether it comes from 
the crowd or their teammates.

“I feed off energy,” Karas said, 

“I always tell my teammates, 
‘you’ve gotta be loud for me!’ 
But I love energy, I love the 
excitement of the crowd, I love 
looking at, like making eye 
contact with people in the crowd 
and getting excited, it gets me 
excited, and — I thought the 
crowd brought so much energy 
that just helped us in the end 
there.”

That was evident Friday. 

Karas’ floor routine — complete 
with a double Arabian — was met 
with a thunderous cheer from 
a 3,000-strong Crisler crowd. 
From her first pass, Karas drew 
a standing ovation from the 
rambunxious crowd and rode 
the high energy to an event-best 
score of 9.925.

While the camaraderie was 

a high point in Michigan’s 
performance, some aspects still 
need improvement as Brown 
mentioned the team’s landings 
and ability to compete what 
they’ve 
practiced 
could 
get 

better.

Plocki will be the first one to 

say there is no magic fix to help 
a gymnast stick a perfect landing 
every time. But even against No. 
4 Alabama, Michigan displayed a 
patience and poise that carried it 
to victory.

“We’ve got a lot of stuff to 

work on here with people,” 
Plocki said. “But I’m really proud 
of the fact that, when things 
were not going our way, and you 
know, we were under so much 
pressure, we could have easily 
caved — but sometimes you just 
have to keep fighting and believe 
that it’s worth the continued 
fight and you can come out with 
the win.”

Thome flourishes in Michigan loss

With 4:45 remaining in the 

first quarter, Ohio State had 
possession of the ball near 
half court. As the Buckeyes 
passed back and forth, they 
lost control of the ball and it 
rolled over to the other side of 
the court. Several players broke 
into an all-out 
sprint 
in 
an 

attempt to gain 
possession, but 
it was junior 
center 
Hallie 

Thome 
who 

slid 
her 
six-

foot-five body 
across 
the 

floor to secure 
the ball.

The 
crowd 

of 8,313 erupted.

Though Ohio State would 

ultimately prevail in overtime, 
Thome proved to be a key player 
for 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team in Sunday’s 
game, totaling a team-high 27 
points.

“I think we need to realize 

that we’re right there,” said 
Thome. “Now we need to keep 
improving and take it day by 
day ... it’s a loss but a loss is time 

for learning.”

Despite 
Buckeye 
ball 

pressure that forced Thome and 
the Wolverines into numerous 
traveling 
violations, 
Thome 

used footwork to create clean 
shots around the hoop.

“She’s 
got 
outstanding 

footwork, she’s a really skilled 
post,” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico. “I think that they 

were 
bumping 

her a little bit and 
they were calling 
a ton of travels 
against us, really 
more in the first 
half than we had 
all 
year 
long. 

And I think part 
of that was their 
physicality 
and 

we had to adjust 
to that.

“I thought we settled down 

as a team and did a better job in 
the second half of not traveling 
with the basketball. And she 
specifically really settled down 
and just used her quickness and 
her footwork to be aggressive.”

Senior point guard Katelyn 

Flaherty had several assists 
to Thome during the game, 
making them a notable and 
highly-guarded duo.

“It’s better when she’s on my 

side because they can’t help 
down so it’s easier to get into 
the post,” Thome said. “They 
kind of have to pick and choose, 
do they want a three or do they 
want a two? So being able to 
play with a player like this, 
who everyone in the country 
respects, is definitely so nice.”

Ohio 
State’s 
one-on-one 

defense provided Thome an 
advantage not afforded by some 
other teams, who tend to focus 
more attention on Thome.

“She’s coming off of a real 

good game and we talked about 
trying to establish her early and 
get her the ball early and we 
were able to do that,” Barnes 
Arico said. “I think one of her 
advantages was that they left in 
her in a one-on-one and a lot of 
times teams try to double her.”

But Thome was good for 

more than just scoring, proving 
herself as a defensive standout 
Sunday. Early in the second 
quarter, 
Thome 
blocked 
a 

shot that put the fans on their 
feet. And in a matchup with 
Stephanie Mavunga, one of 
the Buckeyes’ best players, she 
stood her ground.

“She really attacked her,” 

Barnes 
Arico 
said. 
“She 

definitely 
won 
the 
battle 

tonight.”

Content with retirement, former coach Berenson honored Friday night

Surrounded by a sea of maize 

in Yost Ice Arena Friday night, 
the Michigan hockey team made 
its way out for pregame skate, all 
donning white sweaters. It was a 
strange sight before an advertised 
“Maize Out Yost” night.

Upon further inspection, each 

warmup jersey was the same, 
each boldly displaying No. 9. 
“Berenson” embroidered on the 
back with the captain’s “C” sewn 
on the heart.

On the night dedicated to 

his legacy, this part of the 
commemoration was a surprise 
for Red Berenson. Through he 
showed a wide grin, Berenson 
was quick to explain that when 
he played, there were no names 
on jerseys, which were wool to 
combat cold rink temperatures in 
the old Coliseum.

“The first guy I noticed was 

(senior 
defenseman) 
Cutler 

Martin,” 
Berenson 
said. 
“I 

thought, ‘Geez, Cutler’s wearing 
the ‘C’ tonight.’ Then I realized 
they were all wearing the ‘C.’ ”

This was just one of many 

tributes to Berenson before Friday 
night’s matchup against Notre 
Dame. The legendary Michigan 
hockey coach of 33 years, who 
retired at the end of last season, 
was officially honored with the 
formal dedication of the “Red 
Berenson Rink.”

The 
new 
ice 
design 
— 

unanimously approved by the 
University’s Board of Regents in 
October — features Berenson’s 
signature near both blue lines. 
Next 
season, 
“Red 
Berenson 

Rink” will replace “Yost Ice 
Arena” in the center ice circle.

“That was a good likeness (of 

my signature),” Berenson said. “I 
wasn’t expecting anything, but 
this is pretty neat.”

A video package chronicling 

Berenson’s career was shown 
before 
the 
opening 
faceoff. 

Additionally, a banner sporting 
his face was sprawled over the 

Children of Yost student section. 
During the national anthem, 
the sold-out crowd of 5,800 
fans screamed “Red” when the 
appropriate lyric arrived.

Capping 
off 
the 
pre-game 

festivities, a ceremonial puck drop 
celebrated one of the Michigan 
greats. As he made his way from 
the bench to center ice — a walk 
that started at a quick pace and 
ended as a slower, more reflective 
saunter — Berenson stopped at 
the end of the black carpet to pose 
for a photo with senior forward 
and captain Tony Calderone and 
Fighting Irish captain Jake Evans.

But it took a couple promptings 

from 
photographers 
and 
a 

“drop the puck” chant from 
the Wolverine faithful before 
Berenson did so.

The once ever-serious coach 

was too busy taking it all in.

“I really appreciate the gesture 

from the athletic department,” 
Berenson said. “I’m thankful 
for all the good teams and good 
players we’ve had at Michigan 
over my time, and good coaches. 
You don’t do this by yourself. 
You teach a lot of good people. I 
was lucky I was at a school like 
Michigan. Good things happen 
at Michigan and this was one of 
them.”

***
Berenson originally arrived 

in Ann Arbor from Regina, 
Saskatchewan 
as 
a 
student-

athlete in 1959. He played four 
years of hockey and was named 
All-American twice, the 1962 
WCHA Most Valuable Player and 
a team captain his senior season. 
After graduation, Berenson spent 
17 years in the NHL as a center for 
the New York Rangers, St. Louis 
Blues, Detroit Red Wings and 
Montreal Canadiens.

While hoisting the Stanley 

Cups in 1965 and 1966 with 
Montreal, he never strayed too far 
from Michigan, simultaneously 
earning a Master of Business 
Administration at the university 
he has always called home.

After coaching in the NHL 

until 1984, Berenson returned to 
his alma mater as head coach. His 
unwavering pursuit of excellence 
immediately 
transformed 
the 

hockey program into one of the 
nation’s most storied.

This 
mindset, 
which 
led 

to a complete turnaround for 
Michigan hockey, is one he 
continues to live by to this day. 
And with the Wolverines heading 
into the first intermission, down 
2-1 Friday, Berenson would want 
this same “pursuit of excellence” 
message shared with the team if 
he were in the locker room.

“I would just remind them of 

the great opportunity that they 
have to play at Michigan and 
to bring what they can bring to 
Michigan,” Berenson said. “It’s 
not what Michigan is going to 
do for you. What are you going 
to do for Michigan? We brought 
you here because of this, this and 
this — and are you doing that? 
Are you living up to that, and are 
you getting better? And are you 
making the team better? Are you 
making the people around you 
proud?

“They need to be reminded 

every so often. It becomes a job, 
you’re going to school and then 
coming down here. But you’ve 
got to love it or you wouldn’t do it. 
And if you’re going to do it, do it 
well.”

Under 
Berenson’s 
tutelage, 

Michigan players consistently did 
their jobs well.

The 
Wolverines 
captured 

21 
conference 
championships 

and qualified for the NCAA 
Tournament in 23 of his last 
27 seasons. From 1991 to 2012, 
Michigan received 22 straight 
tournament bids, an NCAA record 
that still stands. Berenson led the 
Wolverines to 11 Frozen Fours and 
national championships in 1996 
and 1998.

Berenson retired with the 

fourth-most wins in NCAA ice 
hockey history with an 848-
426-92 career record. He also 
mentored 
two 
Hobey 
Baker 

Memorial Award winners, 73 

NHL players and 140 Academic 
All-Big Ten selections.

Berenson 
has 
nothing 
but 

gratitude for others when looking 
back at his illustrious career.

“I couldn’t have imagined 

this,” Berenson said. “I’ve been 
really lucky to have been around 
good people and somehow, I made 
some sort of contribution one way 
or another. And here we are today. 
… When you get the right group 
together, great things can happen. 
I was lucky to be a part of a few 
good groups and I’ve been lucky 
to be at Michigan.”

The man who will forever 

consider himself fortunate for 
every opportunity he received 
passed the same attitude onto 
this year’s team prior to Friday’s 
matchup.

“The thing I mentioned before 

the game is that it’s something 
bigger than yourself,” Berenson 
said. “You become bigger than 
yourself. It’s not just about you, 
it’s about all the things that are 
going on around you that you’re a 
part of. Just going to the football 
games, reading about Michigan 
graduates maybe going to the 
moon or whatever they do. You’re 
a part of that and they’re a part of 
you. It’s amazing and it goes on 
and on. It never stops.”

Many in the dressing room 

skated 
for 
Berenson 
during 

parts of their college careers, so 
listening to their former coach 
address the team once again 
and seeing him recognized are 
unforgettable.

“We had a great three years 

together,” Calderone said. “I 
learned a lot from him and he 
really progressed me as a player. 
It was awesome seeing him out 
there tonight and getting what he 
deserves.”

Added 
senior 
defenseman 

Sam Piazza: “It’s really just a 
phenomenal honor for him and 
well-deserved. It was an awesome 
experience 
before 
the 
game 

today.”

Current 
Michigan 
coach 

Mel Pearson — who spent 23 

years under Berenson as both 
an assistant and associate head 
coach — praised his predecessor 
and applauded the recognition 
Berenson received.

“It was a great night for Red,” 

Pearson said. “He’s been a great 
ambassador for the University 
of 
Michigan, 
the 
athletic 

department, our hockey program 
and for college hockey. We can’t 
honor or thank a man like him 
enough.

“But it was a nice way to do 

that. A very classy man and a 
very classy move by (athletic 
director) Warde Manuel and our 
athletic department, naming that 
rink after him. It’s going to be a 
pleasure coming here every day 
and knowing that name is on that 
rink.”

***
After 33 years filled with the 

daily grind of practices, film 
studies and game preparations, 
Berenson is now content watching 
from the stands.

“It’s been good, really good,” 

Berenson said. “I don’t lose any 
sleep if our power play is not 
working or if our goalie isn’t 
playing well or whatever. I’ve let it 
go and like I told Mel, ‘You’ve got 
the keys to the car. Go for it. I’ll be 
here when you need me.’ But I’m 
happy with my decision and I’m 
happy with the decision to bring 
Mel Pearson back.”

Since 
announcing 
his 

retirement last April, Berenson 
has kept busy. Over the summer, 
he went fishing in Florida and 
hunting in Manitoba. Nowadays, 
Berenson spends time at his 
Ann Arbor home with his wife, 
children and grandchildren.

He traveled to Moscow in 

September to celebrate the 45th 
anniversary of the famed Summit 
Series between the Soviet National 
Team and Berenson’s own Team 
Canada. In the 1972 international 
competition, Canada swept the 
final three games in Moscow to 
win the series, 4-3-1. During the 
recent trip, Berenson and his old 
teammates were invited to speak 

and dine with Russian president 
Vladimir Putin.

Instead 
of 
agonizing 
over 

film of the Wolverines’ biggest 
plays, Berenson chooses to sit 
back at home with his NHL 
television package. However, he 
still makes sure to either attend 
or watch every Michigan game, 
determined to support Pearson 
and the hockey program that 
defined his career.

He has also become a special 

advisor 
to 
Manuel, 
while 

continuing to work on endowing 
all 
the 
hockey 
program’s 

scholarships.

Not to be outdone, the 78-year-

old sets aside time to lace up his 
skates Tuesday nights in the 
alumni league — on the Yost ice 
that will bear his name.

“I was playing three times a 

week until I dinged my elbow,” 
Berenson said. “But I’ll be back. 
I’m enjoying it. I’m playing with 
guys my age, not these young 
guys.”

***
Before the game, Berenson 

signed a young girl’s St. Louis 
Blues jersey and threw it back to 
her over the glass. He waved and 
smiled at fans as he made his way 
to the exits following Friday’s 
game.

During the first intermission, 

he joked with reporters about 
his age and the fact that he is 40 
years older than the next-oldest 
player in the alumni league. He 
discussed his views on hockey in 
the upcoming Winter Olympics 
and the Children of Yost’s nightly 
rendition of “O Canada.”

The relaxed and jovial nature 

of Berenson showed a new side 
of 
the 
straight-shooter, 
who 

used to expect nothing short of 
perfection from his players. It 
showed a Berenson who has come 
to terms with retirement and the 
decision to close the chapter on 
his coaching legacy.

“You’re totally invested in your 

team and the game, and now I’m 
not,” Berenson said with a smile. 
“I’ve had my time.”

Michigan swept by Notre Dame over weekend

SOUTH BEND — The Michigan 

hockey team entered its third 
period with nothing to show for 
its impressive offensive showing 
against the nation’s second-ranked 
team. Notre Dame on the other 
hand — which played in a largely 
similar fashion as the Wolverines 
— had already found the net twice. 

Forward Josh Norris then 

provided Michigan with a glimpse 
of hope. The freshman scored 
off a rebound to cut the deficit to 
one with eleven minutes to spare 
in the game. However, though 
the Wolverines have seen many 
successful 
late-game 
rallies 

throughout the season, this time, it 
wouldn’t be enough.

Despite 
demonstrating 
an 

ability to keep up with the Fighting 
Irish, Michigan suffered the same 
fate as it did in its game Friday. The 
Wolverines (3-7-2-1 Big Ten, 8-10-
2 overall) fell, 2-1, and were swept 
in their home-and-home series 
against the third-best defensive 
team in the nation.

“I thought we saw a lot of really 

good things this weekend,” said 
Michigan coach Mel Pearson. 
“I didn’t like the results, I’m not 
happy with the results, but you 
can’t complain about the effort.”

Right out of the gate, high 

energy and forceful offenses were 
on display at Compton Family Ice 
Arena — a noticeably amplified 
performance from both sides of 

the puck in comparison to Friday’s 
showing.

Just over two minutes into 

play, Notre Dame created the first 
dangerous scoring opportunity 
of the game, forcing sophomore 
goaltender Hayden Lavigne to 
extend himself to make five saves 
over a minute and a half.

Lavigne 
continued 
to 
play 

a 
crucial 
role 
for 
Michigan 

throughout the game, making 
34 saves, and appears to have 
tentatively earned the starting 
spot in goal.

“He made some big time saves, 

and I thought he’s established 
himself this weekend as our guy,” 
Pearson said. “It’s just two games 
but we haven’t had a guy put back 
to back games like that, and good 
for him. We’re going to need that 
going forward … so I thought he 
was excellent, and that’s all we 
need.”

The Fighting Irish pressed 

again a minute later, finding the 
net this time. However, after 
further review, the goal became 
nullified due to a hand pass.

Notre Dame received the first 

man-advantage at 6:44 in the 
game, when senior forward Tony 
Calderone was given a penalty 
for hooking. Though the Fighting 
Irish again saw many close 
attempts, they could not get the 
puck past Lavigne.

The remainder of the period 

was characterized by back-and-
forth, gritty play from both 
Michigan and Notre Dame. The 

Wolverines saw their most viable 
scoring opportunity with five 
minutes remaining in the period, 
when they fired five shots at 
Fighting Irish goaltender Cale 
Morris. However, their efforts 
remained fruitless, and both teams 
entered the first intermission with 
the scoreboard still blank.

Though Notre Dame’s potent 

offense was not fully visible in 
Friday’s game, this was not the case 
in Sunday’s first period. While the 
Wolverines outshot the Fighting 
Irish in every period Friday, Notre 
Dame nearly doubled Michigan’s 
shot count in the first period of the 
game on Sunday. This highlighted 
Lavigne’s standout showing over 
the period, as he stopped all fifteen 
of the Fighting Irish’s on-target 
shots.

The Wolverines came out hot to 

begin the second period, keeping 
the puck mostly within Notre 
Dame’s defensive zone for the first 
four minutes of play. Over this 
period, Michigan blasted seven 
shots at Morris, and the netminder 
was able to keep the puck from 
passing him. 

Despite unevenly dominating 

the start of the period, the 
Wolverines were unable to get on 
the scoreboard first. 6:10 into the 
period, Michigan turned the puck 
over in the neutral zone, creating 
an odd-man rush for the Fighting 
Irish. 
Notre 
Dame 
forward 

Andrew Oglevie capitalized on the 
change in possession, sending the 
puck into the upper right corner of 

Michigan’s net to give the Fighting 
Irish the first lead of the game.

The Wolverines did not let 

up on pressure, firing numerous 
on-target shots at Morris over 
the next few minutes. Halfway 
through the period, Notre Dame 
received a penalty for slashing, 
giving Michigan a power play. 
The Fighting Irish were able to 
kill the penalty and drew a man-
advantage of their own right after 
their penalty ended.

A minute into the power play, 

Notre Dame defenseman Matt 
Hellickson — who also scored with 
a man-advantage in Friday’s game 
— beat Lavigne, increasing his 
team’s lead to two.

With just over two minutes 

remaining in the period, Notre 
Dame had the opportunity to 
capitalize 
on 
another 
man-

advantage, but this time the 
Wolverines stood their ground. 
Michigan 
killed 
the 
penalty, 

keeping its deficit at two goals 
heading into the final period of 
regulation.

Both teams entered the third 

period showing no signs of energy 
loss, with the Fighting Irish 
coming full force and continuously 
challenging Lavigne in the first 
half of the period.

Though Michigan was able 

to get on the board 8:44 into the 
period with Norris’ goal, Notre 
Dame’s sturdy defense was able 
to limit the Wolverines’ offensive 
opportunities for a majority of the 
period, while the Fighting Irish 
kept up offensive intensity.

With 
a 
minute 
to 
spare, 

Michigan took out Lavigne in 
exchange for an extra man, but 
was unable to come up with a goal 
before time ran out. 

Despite walking away from 

the weekend with two losses, 
which could be taken negatively, 
the Wolverines understood that 
their hard work and intensity did 
not necessarily line up with the 
outcomes they received. 

“We just played the whole 

weekend, I thought, these were 
two of our best games all year,” 
Lavigne said. “We worked hard, we 
blocked shots, we were physical, 
we were fast. I think against any 
other team those are probably two 
different games … a lot of good 
things were happening.”

WOMEN’S GYMNASTICS
No. 7 Michigan pulls off 
upset over No. 4 Alabama

Olivia Karas opened her floor 

exercise, the penultimate of the 
meet, with a double Arabian.

The difficult tumbling pass 

consists of a half-twist into two 
front flips. Karas nailed it.

The 
junior 
finished 
her 

routine with as much spirit as 
she began. The crowd began 
chanting her name.

A few minutes later, the 

score was official. The No. 7 
Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team didn’t even need the final 
floor score from junior Emma 
McLean to pull off the upset 
against No. 4 Alabama, 196.2 to 
195.675.

The 
meet 
wasn’t 
always 

pretty. Both teams suffered 
their fair share of mistakes, but 
what set the Wolverines apart 
was their ability to recover.

In 
the 
first 
rotation, 

freshman 
Syd 
Townsend 

put her hands down on her 
Yurchenko 
one-and-a-half 

vault, 
but 
in 
the 
second 

rotation, she bounced back with 
a 9.85 on bars, complete with a 
stuck dismount.

“I talked to her and I said, 

‘One of the biggest things we’ve 
gotta be able to do is let the 
past be in the past,’ and she 
went out there and rocked a bar 
routine,” Plocki said. “That’s an 
incredible thing for her to learn 
as a young freshman.”

Even for the older gymnasts, 

facing a top-ranked team was 
an exercise in controlling their 
nerves.

“It’s 
good 
practice 
for 

meets later on and dealing 
with pressure and pressure 
situations,” 
Karas 
said. 

“Sometimes, if you have a lot 
of adrenaline and energy … you 
have to minimize it to the best 
of your abilities.”

On the balance beam — often 

the most harrowing event — 
Michigan was unfazed. Senior 
Lauren Marinez earned a 9.875 
with her steady acrobatics, 
difficult 
jump 
connections 

and 
stuck 
double-twisting 

dismount.

Entering the final rotation, 

the 
floor 
exercise, 
the 

Wolverines held the slightest 
of 
leads 
over 
Alabama, 

which had yet to go on beam. 
Michigan knew it needed big 
performances.

The Wolverines got off to a 

shaky start. Although nobody 
fell, the first three competitors 
had several landing deductions, 
and none earned above a 9.7.

But the true character of the 

team showed not in its mistakes 
on floor, but how it reacted.

“We were under so much 

pressure, we could have easily 
caved,” Plocki said. “Those last 
three floor routines could have 
had mistakes, and it could have 
been different.”

Indeed, in the end, the meet 

came down to performance 
under pressure. After a fall on 
the beam early in the rotation, 
the Crimson Tide were unable 
to 
recover 
as 
their 
final 

performer put her hands down 
on a skill. Only able to drop one 
score on the event, Alabama 
was forced to count a fall.

That’s not what happened for 

Michigan.

Its last three routines were 

nearly flawless. Senior Brianna 
Brown 
earned 
a 
9.8 
with 

her energetic routine. Karas 
earned a 9.925. And though the 
Wolverines would have won 
without her score, McLean 
didn’t let up, garnering a 9.9.

“It was a little not what we

counted.
