More than 50 University 

of Michigan students and 
community members gathered 
Tuesday night in the Diag as 
part of a vigil commemorating 
the deaths of civilians due to a 
U.S-led coalition of airstrikes 
in Aleppo, Syria, and Mosul, 
Iraq.

On March 16, an explosion 

in a Syrian mosque left 46 
civilians dead, and between 
March 17 and March 23, more 
than 200 civilians were killed 
in Mosul, as the United States 
fought 
to 
clear 
members 

of the Islamic State from 
the city. As many speakers 

mentioned, 
human-rights 

group Amnesty International 
noted the high civilian toll 
in Mosul suggested U.S.-led 
coalition forces had failed to 
take adequate precautions to 
prevent civilian deaths.

LSA 
sophomore 
Abbas 

Alhassan said he attended 
the vigil because he is of 
Iraqi descent and believes it 
is important to represent his 
heritage at the University.

“You know, I really feel 

like 
the 
Arabs 
here 
are 

very 
underrepresented, 
so 

whenever we have a chance 
to come out and show who we 
are, it’s very important,” he 
said. “You have to show up. 
Otherwise, things like this 

Tuesday evening, Central 

Student Government held its 
last meeting for the 2016-17 
school year.

The 
meeting 
began 
by 

featuring 
several 
guest 

speakers, starting with Chief 
Diversity Officer Rob Sellers, 
the University of Michigan 
vice provost for equity and 
inclusion. Sellers presented 
details 
of 
the 
Diversity, 

Equity and Inclusion plan, 
a five-year plan launched 
in October to help create a 
more diverse and inclusive 
campus. Sellers explained the 
planning 
process, 
creation 

and initiatives of the plan, but 
stated the most crucial aspect 
of the plan is accountability.

“It is extremely important 

that the plan be one that 
is 
about 
metrics 
and 

accountability,” he said.

Sellers stated the Board of 

Regents, University President 
Mark Schlissel, and individual 
school and college deans are 
all included when listing the 
members of administration 
who 
should 
be 
held 

accountable 
for 
upholding 

the plan. He explained the 
difficulty faculty has had in 
previous years dealing with 
issues like microaggressions 
in the classroom. Part of 
the plan works to tackle 
this issue, providing faculty 
with 
specific 
training 
to 

understand how to address 
problems of discrimination in 
the classroom and act on this 
understanding.

“Diversity is a necessary 

component but not a sufficient 
one,” he said. “We also have 
to have an environment that 
is equitable and inclusive for 
diversity to work.”

He also highlighted the idea 

that, while it is important for 

the plan to continue to create 
new initiatives, it is helpful to 
recognize the University has 
a number of programs already 
in place that are ready to be 
built upon and improved.

the Michigan Union, which 
was founded in 1904 and is the 
third-oldest student union in 
the country. They explained 
that 
last 
year,

began gathering student input 

As course-backpacking season 

begins, University of Michigan 
students can now use ClassAI, 
a new web app that uses a 
model to analyze the chances 
students have of getting into a 
class based on the date and time 
they register. The web app was 
co-founded and designed by 
Business senior Jordan Katz and 
Engineering junior Tyler Laredo 
to save students an estimated five 
to 10 hours during backpacking 
for open courses.

“The big thing about this is 

this doesn’t exist,” Katz said. “We 
had to create this from scratch. I 
wanted to create something for 
all students to avoid having these 
problems in the future.”

Katz said he has spent hours 

rearranging his schedules and 
searching for courses ever since 
he was a freshman. The app gives 
students the percentage points 
of their chances of successfully 
enrolling for a course, as well as 
graphs on how quickly sections 
fill up.

GEO. The narrow hallway of 
the bottom floor of the building 
was almost entirely crowded by

Kangaroo spotted running 
Detroit streets was part of 
traveling exhibit

University of Michigan alum 

Michael Rubenstone will premiere 

his first documentary, “On the Sly: 

In Search of the Family Stone” at the 

Freep Film Festival April 1 in Detroit.

The documentary follows 

Rubenstone’s 12-year search for funk 

legend Sly Stone, frontman of the 

band Sly and the Family Stone, which 

gained popularity in the 1960s. In 

2010, the band was ranked 43rd on 

Rolling Stone magazine’s list of “The 

100 Greatest Artists of All-Time” and 

has been noted for its unique multi-

racial, multi-gendered make-up.

In an interview with MLive, 

Rubenstone noted the relevance of 

the band’s unique sound during such 

a tumultuous decade.

“Particularly in their earlier 

recordings — like ‘You Can Make 

It If You Try,’ ‘Sing a Simple Song,’ 

‘Everyday People’ — they sort of 

espoused this holistic paradigm,” he 

said. “They were everyday people, 

Black and white, male and female, all 

contributing to an incredible sound 

during a very, very turbulent era.”

Rubenstone graduated from the 

University in 1999 with a degree in 

theater. He later explained to the 

Daily he began filmmaking after 

moving to Los Angeles as a way to 

find fulfillment in his career, while 

maintaining his passion and love for 

acting.

“I got into filmmaking by 

accident, really,” he wrote in an email 

interview. “I moved out to LA from 

New York to continue my career as an 

actor. I was able to get some work, but 

found it very unfulfilling. This project 

gave me more control of my career. I 

could always work on a cut, develop 

the script, seek out another interview. 

That was very rewarding. I still act. I 

still love it. But somehow I got my big 

break as a director. Go figure. Strange 

how things work sometimes, but you 

have to be open to changing paths in 

this business.” 

Rubenstone noted how the 

artist’s music has influenced him 

since high school, and how he 

wanted to locate Stone after the artist 

disappeared from the music world. 

According to Rubenstone, what began 

as a few inquiries around the city 

quickly transformed into more than a 

decade-long project.

“When I saw the Woodstock 

documentary in high school, I was 

blown away by Sly’s performance,” 

he said. “When I moved out to LA 

to pursue my career as an actor, it 

occurred to me that Sly was also 

in LA, and I thought it would be 

interesting to see if I could track 

him down. So I picked up a camera 

and started making little inquiries 

around LA. That’s 

essentially how it 

started. Twelve 

years later, I 

finally got it 

done.”

Rubenstone 

said his film’s 

director of the 

Freep Film 

Festival sought 

out “On the Sly” 

due to his affinity 

for the artist, as 

well as Rubenstone’s position as an 

alum.

“I am honored to return to 

Michigan and share this film with 

some friends from college,” he said. 

“Steve Byrne, the director of the 

Freep Festival, sought out the film 

not only because he was a Sly fan, but 

also because I was a Wolverine. It’s 

great that this festival pays tribute 

to the fascinating history of Detroit, 

Michigan, but also gives a nod to 

some Alums.”

ON THE DAILY: FILMMAKING ON THE SLY

Michael Twitty, author of The Cooking Gene, speaks about “ide-
nitity cooking” at the food literacy event in Angell Hall on Tuesday.

S PE AK I N G FOO D

A research team in the 

University of Michigan College 
of Engineering succeeded in 
creating a tarnish-proof silver 
film whose properties allow 
for various uses such as high-
tech screens. The team’s paper, 
published last Monday, details 
the film’s versatility.

As the silver film is ultra-

thin, it can be used for displays 
such the touch screens on 
cell phones. The film is also 
transparent, which is why it 
can be directly applied to solar 
cells or organic LED displays 
— increasing efficiencies as the 
film allows more light to enter 
solar cells and to leave the 
LEDs.

Cheng 
Zhang, 
a 
former 

Engineering 
Ph.D. 
student, 

currently works at the National 
Institute 
of 
Standards 
and 

Technology and is the first 
writer listed on the paper. Zhang 
highlighted the advantages of 
film, especially when used for 
future flexible screens. So far, he 
explained, the material indium 
tin oxide is widely used for touch 
screens. 
However, 
it 
cracks 

very easily when moved, which 
interferes with the materials’ 
conductivity. Since silver films 
have a much better stability, 
even when moved, they are more 
suitable for flexible screens.

Another material currently 

used as a transparent conductor 
for flexible displays is graphene. 
However, the silver film shows 
major 
advantages 
compared 

to this material; namely, its 
conductivity is much better than 
the conductivity of graphene.

Zhang said silver films might 

be a better future alternative to 

ITO for economic reasons, as 
prices for indium are likely to 
rise in the future, whereas the 
price of silver compared to that 
is more likely to stay stable.

“Indium itself is a rare 

element,” 
Zhang 
said. 
“In 

addition, most of the supply 
of indium is in China and in 
Canada, so it is not everywhere 
in the world, only a few places.”

L. Jay Guo, a professor of 

electrical 
engineering 
and 

computer science, supervised 
the 
research 
team, 
and 

explained there were previous 
difficulties in producing ultra-
thin 
silver 
films. 
Previous 

techniques to overcome these 
technical difficulties included 
adding other films beneath the 
silver film.

“It is known in the scientific 

community that if you want 
to form a silver film like this 
that is thin, it is not going to 

be continuous,” Guo said. 
“But adding another film 
would inevitably impact the 
performance of the silver 
film.”

Guo and his team set 

out to solve the problem by 
combining the silver with a 
small amount of aluminum. 
This allowed for them to 
create an ultra-thin, seven-
nanometer 
silver 
film, 

smooth, 
transparent 
and 

resistant to tarnish.

Chengang 
Ji, 
a 
Ph.D. 

student 
in 
electrical 

engineering and computer 
science, was also part of the 
research team. Ji pointed 
out the market possibilities 
of the silver film given all 
its advantages compared to 
currently used materials.

“We 
are 
trying 
to 

commercialize this product 
because it has very good 
potential 
for 
the 
next 

generation,” Ji said. “So we 
are trying to a find a way 
for mass production of this 
silver film.”

will go unnoticed.”

Surrounded by the glow of 

candles, speakers mourned those 
lost in the airstrikes, while also 
emphasizing the importance of 
remembering the humanity of 
those killed, rather than statistics 
portraying the immense number 
of lives lost. Speeches touched on 
highly personal topics, such as 
an Iraqi speaker’s mother loving 
purple but always wearing black 
because of constant mourning, 
or 
another 
student’s 
brother 

lamenting that to die in Syria 
means “to be forgotten.”

Alhassan 
further 
stressed 

coming together as a community 
to mourn the faces behind the 
death tolls.

“When we see things like 

this, 200 deaths in Iraq and 
Syria, when we hear about this 
very often, you know this many 
deaths, this many deaths, it just 
continuously adds up and at 
some point it all just becomes a 
number,” he said. “So if we’re not 
doing things like this, we’re just 
going to keep reading about it and 
seeing about it as a number. But 
when we all come out together 
we start to understand it, there’s 
a more realistic reason behind 

doing it.”

Engineering senior Nusayba 

Tabbah, whose family is from 
Syria, noted the proliferation of 
human deaths in the media has 
led people to become numb to the 
tragedy, even those personally 
affected.

“I feel like I’ve constantly been 

coming to these vigils — it’s kind 
of gotten to be pretty routine,” she 
said. “I feel like it’s actually kind 
of slowed down this semester, not 
because any of the tragedies have 
lessened but because it’s become 
so normal, which is really sad. 
Even 
as 
Syrian-Americans, 

whose families has been directly 
affected by the conflict, it’s easy 
for us to become numb to it.”

LSA 
sophomore 
Courtney 

Caulkins, an organizer with the 
Michigan 
Refugee 
Assistance 

Program, said she attended the 
vigil to support her friend Alyiah 
Al-Bonijim, one of the event’s 
organizers, and to stay aware of 
U.S. military actions in countries 
overseas. 

“I think that the conflict right 

now in Iraq and Syria is really 
connected 
with 
the 
refugee 

crisis, from both places right now, 
and we should be holding our 
government accountable for the 
actions that are taking place very 
far away and ensuring we aren’t 
being blinded by the distance,” 
Caulkins said.

GEO and the University 

Human Resources department 
have 
been 
negotiating 
a 

new three-year contract for 
graduate-student 
employees 

since last September, as the 
current contract expires at 
the end of April. GEO brings 
proposals 
crafted 
by 
the 

graduate-student community 
to bargaining sessions that 
typically occur once a week.

Chief among the proposals 

that 
GEO 
members 

emphasize, which include pay 
raises, expanded health-care 
benefits and protection for 
international students, is the 
establishment of unionized 
positions 
for 
graduate-

student staff assistants doing 
diversity work on behalf of the 
University’s Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion plan. Rackham 
student 
Rachel 
Miller 

said 
the 
human-resources 

department has refused to 
discuss the issue during the 
bargaining process, arguing 
it is not a mandatory subject 
for the contract, but DEI 
administrators then informed 
GEO the proposal was under 
the 
purview 
of 
contract 

negotiators.

“They also won’t talk about 

it with us anywhere else 
because they say we’re talking 
about bargaining, so we’re 
getting stonewalled all over 
the place,” Miller said.

Social Work student Vidhya 

Aravind 
currently 
works 

part time on the University 
Library’s 
implementation 

team for the DEI initiative 
and said such positions are 
demanding 
and 
require 

expertise, 
justifying 

compensation on par with 
other graduate positions.

“I think it’s important to 

recognize that diversity labor 
is labor,” she said.” It takes 
a lot of effort, a lot of time, 
a lot of energy and a lot of 
expertise.”

Aravind 
went 
on 
to 

compare her work on the 
library team to her experience 
volunteering with the School 
of Information’s DEI unit, 
which she described as a mess.

“Some DEI units have that 

expertise, some DEI units 
have demonstrated that they 
don’t,” Aravind said. “Some 
units are taking in student 
input and have these GSSA 
positions already, which is 
amazing, but we want that 
across the spectrum of the 
academic DEI plan, because 
we think it’s important that 
marginalized students have 
better platforms for input 
than they currently do. We 
understand that marginalized 
students have the expertise 
the University needs for DEI 
to succeed, and marginalized 
students have needs which 
the University is equipped to 
cover.” 

On 
other 
issues, 
GEO 

members still feel that the 
University has not agreed to 

do enough to help.

Referring 
to 
a 
Detroit 

News op-ed written by the 
presidents of several Michigan 
universities, 
including 

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel on the subject of 
international 
students 
and 

faculty, 
which 
asserted 

support 
for 
international 

students and faculty, Miller 
said GEO is calling for “actual 
protections (for international 
students), not just language.” 
A proposal by GEO to create 
work-hour caps on GSIs in 
support of students on visas 
with work quotas was met 
by hesitation and concern 
from faculty members on the 
Senate Advisory Committee 
on University Affairs earlier 
this month.

In an interview last week, 

Schlissel said he could not 
comment on negotiations, but 
pushed GSIs to reframe their 
work week as a critical portion 
of their learning experiences in 
academia.

“The union perceives it as 

work for pay, but it’s actually 
more of a training,” he said.

In regard to salary rates, 

GEO President John Ware, a 
Rackham student, explained the 
raise offered by the University 
did not keep up with Ann 
Arbor’s cost of living.

“The cost of living is up more 

than 6 percent this year over 
last year in Ann Arbor, and 
we’ve been offered a 2.5-percent 
raise,” he said.

University 
spokeswoman 

Kim Broekhuizen wrote in an 

email statement that the current 
proposal on the table offers 
wage increases every year, in 
addition to increased leave time 
for parental accommodation 
and bereavement, as well as 
additional 
protections 
for 

international graduate-student 
instructors to comply with 
work restrictions required to 
maintain their visa status.

“We appreciate the Graduate 

Employee 
Organization’s 

commitment to not disrupting 
activities in these buildings 
during this planned activity,” 
she wrote. “Talks continue and 
we are hopeful about having a 
new contract in place soon.”

Toward the end of the sit-

in, demonstrators congregated 
in 
the 
entrance 
of 
the 

Administration Building, taking 
turns to share their reasons 
for being there — including 
needs for greater child-care 
subsidies, health-care subsidies 
and higher wages. After each 
speaker, the crowd cheered and 
clapped, while employees in the 
building squeezed past to get to 
the elevator or a nearby office.

“I’m here even though I’m 

leaving soon because I care 
about future generations of 
(graduate) students on this 
campus, and because I did a 
lot of work in DEI, never being 
compensated 
or 
recognized 

for it, which derailed my own 
progress and success,” said a 
Rackham student who asked 
to stay anonymous. “But I 
think that future generation 
should have it better than I 
had.”

registration date,” Katz said. 
“I would have to change my 
schedule multiple times before 
registration. I felt like every 
time I registered, I essentially 
wasted time by not having 
information to go off of, like 
looking into classes I might 
have statistically no chance of 
getting into.”

The team compiled statistics 

and data from last semester’s 
registration period for winter 
2017, 
mostly 
mined 
from 

University data, indicating how 
quickly every course, section 
and lab at the University 
filled up. Katz said they found 
trends 
and 
patterns 
from 

year to year for registration 
depending on the date and time 
you register using primarily 
the University’s Application 
Program Interface portal.

“In order to collect the data 

that’s powering our model, 
I actually started building 
this in November, and I built 
the system to capture all that 
data through the University’s 
programmatic 
(interface),” 

Katz said. “The big thing was 
getting it while the registration 
process was happening.”

Engineering 
junior 

Tyler Ringler said he uses 

ClassAI because he has a late 
registration date and hasn’t 
been able to get into two to 
three classes per semester he 
originally wanted. He said 
he typically has to redo his 
schedule several times before 
finding one that works.

“It is a very useful tool 

when it comes to scheduling,” 
Ringler said. “It was very easy 
to sign up and even easier to 
add my classes. It took me less 
than three minutes to sign up 
and add all of my classes onto 
the app. This is the same time 
it would take me to search 
for my class, find the class 
number, and then change tabs 
and backpack it in Wolverine 
Access.”

While 
not 
wanting 
to 

reveal all the factors of their 
algorithm, 
Katz 
said 
they 

do 
take 
professor 
ratings 

and teacher-evaluation from 
course evaluation scores to 
help shape their predictions.

“It’s not just one kind of 

piece of information we’re 
looking at,” Katz said. “We 
want a comprehensive view to 
be accurate.”

Katz said this kind of solution 

to 
students’ 
registration 

troubles 
is 
unprecedented 

and hopes that after their first 
time doing this for the fall 
2017 semester based off winter 
2017 data they’ll be able to get 
an accurate display of data for 

both fall and winter semesters.

“So 
far 
based 
on 
our 

tests, 
we 
feel 
confident,” 

Katz said. “Really what it 
comes down to is increasing 
information, 
because 
right 

now there’s no information 
about any of this. After this 
registration process, we’ll have 
a good understanding of both 
(semesters). But right now, we 
apply some of our intuition.”

Katz said ClassAI also could 

save 
many 
students 
from 

stress, as he himself has spent 
hours trying to figure out his 
chances of getting into a class 
by hand, but now the app does 
all the work for him.

“If you’re an anxious person 

like me, you’ll just sit there 
and check that number of 
seats,” Katz said. “Our system 
basically does that work so you 
don’t get to the point where 
you computing the slope of 
enrollment. 
Usually 
those 

things you equate in your head 

aren’t to exact precision.”

Ringler said that though he 

still uses the same amount of 
time to backpack, the app has 
given him a better indication 
of whether he has a chance 
to get into a certain class 
he likes. For Ringler, this is 
“invaluable,” because now he 
can search for alternatives 
sooner than minutes before 
he registers.

“I don’t know if it has 

limited the time I’ve spent 
backpacking, because most of 
the time I spend backpacking 
revolves around getting the 
classes and teachers I want 
to work out,” Ringler said 
“However, it certainly made 
the process easier because I 
have the data in front of me 
that shows if I should consider 
an alternative schedule or 
not. Because of this, I am 
considering my alternatives 
now rather than 10 minutes 
before my registration period, 
which is invaluable.”

Katz said there he hears 

some skepticism on the app’s 
accuracy, but reiterated it is 
meant to only be supplemental 
in helping students to be more 
informed.

“We’re not anti-Wolverine 

Access,” Katz said. “But we’re 
offering an alternative for 
backpacking. The time saved 
can really help students relax 
or spend more time studying.”

we hope it’s going to tell us 
something about the present,” 
Thompson said. “In this case, 
I think what we’re hoping 
that history will tell us is 
it will give us some sense, 
some explanation for how did 
we end up the world’s most 
punitive nation.”

Karen Smyte, president of 

Children’s Literacy Network 
— a group that goes into 
several southeast Michigan 
prisons and records parents 
and 
grandparents 
reading 

bedtime 
stories 
to 
their 

children — came to the event 
because of the relevancy it 
has to her work and what she 
has witnessed within prisons.

“I 
see 
it 
as 
related 

to 
the 
United 
States’s 

history of slavery,” Smyte 
said. 
“The 
justice 
system 

is 
terribly 
broken 
and 

this 
mass 
incarceration 

is 
disproportionately 

impacting poor people (and) 
communities of color.” 

Thompson 
argued 
mass 

incarceration in the United 
States 
did 
not 
happen 

overnight; 
a 
number 
of 

factors contributed to the 

situation, such as the Attica 
Prison 
Uprising 
and 
the 

criminalization of all-Black 
spaces after the Civil War.

“And overnight, the South 

goes from penitentiaries and 
prisons that were all-white 
to 
all-Black,” 
Thompson 

said. “Again, not because 
white folks stop committing 
crimes and Black folks lose 
their 
minds, 
but 
because 

there were policy decisions 
made, and as a result of those 
policies decisions, … we get 
forced labor, we get removal 
of voting privileges and we 
get stability to white power 
essentially in the South.”

Thompson 
continued 

the 
discussion 
on 
prison 

conditions, 
exploring 
the 

circumstances Attica Prison 
inmates 
faced 
before 
the 

rebellion. Each inmate was 
allocated $0.63 of food and 
one square of toilet paper each 
day, among other inhumane 
treatments.

“What’s really remarkable 

is 
that 
these 
men 
still 

somehow had faith in the 
system,” Thompson said. “So 
they wrote letters … they 
wrote letters to state senators, 
they wrote letters to every 
person in power they could 
imagine, saying, ‘Would you 
please help us, we want to do 

this in a democratic process 
… can you please just improve 
the food or let us practice our 
religion?’ ”

On Sept. 9, 1971, the inmates 

broke out of their cells and 
set up a tent city in one of the 
yards farthest from the front 
gate, commencing a four-day 
period of negotiations. The 
state of New York accepted 28 
of the 32 demands, and on the 
fifth day, troopers and state 
police stormed the prison 
after dropping tear gas on 
the inmates, resulting in 39 
deaths and 128 others shot 
severely. The prisoners did 
not have access to guns.

The events following the 

massacre spanned numerous 
actions carried out by the 
state of New York to cover up 
the events that unfolded in 
the prison, Thompson said — 
events that, before her work, 
were unknown. Within the 
prison, 
the 
inmates 
were 

tortured and not given any 
access to medical help.

“These men were stripped, 

they were lined up, they 
were meant to run gauntlets, 
they were thrown into cells 
(that had) nothing in them,” 
Thompson said. “They were 
tortured for days and hours 
and weeks, (with) guards 
urinating 
into 
their 
open 

wounds.”

Mary Heinen, co-founder 

of the Prison Creative Arts 
Project 
and 
a 
formerly 

incarcerated individual, said 
the story of Attica is one 
known within prisons, but 
hopes the book can shed light 
on what goes on within the 
confines of a prison to the rest 
of society.

“The history of this is told 

among members of the inmate 
nation to each other and other 
atrocities as well that have 
happened across the United 
States,” Heinen said. “One of 
the most terrible things that’s 
happened in my lifetime is 
the criminalization of people 
that are mentally ill and drug-
dependent, which is a lot of 
what I saw.”

These events were also 

covered 
up 
by 
the 
state 

of New York, giving most 
Americans only the narrative 
of how prisoners caused the 
deaths and were at fault for 
the massacre. Since then, 
Thompson said, no one has 
been held accountable for the 
actions at Attica.

“Not one member of law 

enforcement is indicted and 
serves time,” Thompson said. 
“Nobody in law enforcement 
was ever held accountable for 
what happened at Attica.”

It is a very 

useful tool when 

it comes to 
scheduling

on how to renovate the Union, 
a project that will begin in 
May of next year, keeping the 
building open for the entirety 
of the bicentennial.

“The 
Union 
needs 
more 

vibrancy 
on 
the 
lower 

levels 
because 
when 
you 

walk in it’s very quiet and 
compartmentalized 
and 
it 

almost feels like you’re walking 
into a library, and that’s not 
how the Union was originally 
designed to be,” Comstock said.

Featured 
renovations 
will 

include the creation of an 
indoor courtyard enclosed by a 
glass roof, two new movement 
studios aimed at providing a 
space for the many dance groups 
that practice in Mason Hall, 
among others, and increasing 
the efficiency of fourth-floor 
space utilized by Counseling 
and Psychological Services in 
order to provide more private 
space for conversation.

The assembly voted on six 

resolutions, passing resolutions 
to increase the number of 
recycling bins around campus, 
to preserve the billiards room 
in the Union, to collaborate 
with the University in finding 
ways to fund the Leadership 
Engagement 
Scholarship, 
to 

allocate funds to UM Social 
Media to aid in the creation of a 
mosaic piece for graduation, as 
well as a resolution to encourage 
University Housing to include 

voter registration in Welcome 

Week 
programming. 
With 

this 
resolution, 
Residential 

Advisers will receive training 
in order to provide freshman 
students 
with 
necessary 

information 
and 
resources 

regarding registration.

CSG President David Schafer, 

an LSA senior, discussed several 
initiatives CSG has worked on 
throughout the year, including 
the 
recent 
establishment 
of 

the 
Student 
Fee 
Advisory 

Committee, 
which 
met 
for 

the first time on Monday. He 
also spoke of the impact of the 
bystander-intervention training 
program, which has held nine 
sessions throughout the year, 
training more than 300 students 
from more than 200 student 
organizations across campus.

Schafer 
and 
CSG 
Vice 

President Micah Griggs, an LSA 
senior, expressed their gratitude 
to the assembly, and spoke of 
their experiences within CSG as 
their terms come to an end.

“We’ve shared countless long 

nights together,” Griggs said. 
“Because of all of you we are 
closer to making our campus 
better for all students. … Serving 
as your vice president has been 
the greatest honor of my life that 
I will always remember.”

Schafer 
said 
similar 

sentiments 
and 
encouraged 

the members of the assembly 
who will continue in CSG to 
remember the impact they have 
on the student body.

“Never doubt the potential of 

CSG to enact positive and lasting 
change on this campus.”

t this point in the Trump 
presidency 
— 
and 

especially on this campus — 

criticizing President Donald Trump 
has become so common 
and routine that doing 
so feels unproductive. 
According to Gallup, 
Trump’s approval rating 
is 36 percent — a record 
low. And on a campus 
where only 12 percent 
of students polled before 
the election said they 
would vote for Trump, 
I suspect that approval 
rating is much, much 
lower. It doesn’t help that 57 percent 
of millennials view Trump as an 
illegitimate president. 

As airwaves, social media 

feeds and personal conversations 
become increasingly saturated 
with criticisms of the new 
administration, 
it’s 
gotten 

harder and harder to sift out 
the 
news 
about 
important 

policy changes from the rest 
of the noise surrounding the 
White House’s personal and 
familial conflicts of interest, 
potential ties to the Russian 
government, 
unsubstantiated 

press statements, inane Twitter 
wars and other repeated scandals 
that have plagued the president 
and his administration. In many 
ways, that makes it easier for 
Trump and his congressional 
allies to ramrod policy changes 
that the majority of Americans 
oppose. That’s not just a problem 
— it’s a slap in the face to our 
representative form of government 
and the constituents whom these 
leaders have a duty to represent.

One policy that has the potential 

to profoundly affect the University 
of Michigan — and our lives 
as students and graduates — is 
Trump’s 
budget 
proposal. 
To 

be sure, Trump’s budget has no 
real legal power unless Congress 
actually adopts it — a big “if” 
considering this budget would 
effectively eliminate 62 federal 
agencies and programs, many 
of which are quite popular with 
constituents. However, the fact that 
Republicans hold majorities in both 
the House and Senate should make 
it more likely that a budget this 
radical could pass.

While Trump’s budget makes 

many devastating cuts that will 
ultimately hurt the country as a 
whole, some have a particularly 
strong impact on the University. 
The proposed cuts to the National 
Institutes of Health, Department 
of Energy, National Endowment for 
the Humanities and the National 
Endowment for the Arts will 
directly and adversely affect the 
University and those who attend, 
graduated from or support it.

As the number-one public research 

university in the country, the University 
received $1.39 billion in research 
funding in fiscal year 2016, two-thirds 
of which came from government 

agencies. 
That 
year, 

University 
researchers 

produced 
more 
than 

400 new inventions; on 
average, a new company 
is launched every five 
weeks due to technology 
pioneered here.

That 
research 

directly 
contributes 

to 
the 
strength 

and prestige of the 
University, enhancing 

both the value of our degrees and 
the quality of education students 
receive here. Not only does the 
strength of the University as a 
research institution contribute to 
its ability to recruit top faculty and 
graduate students — giving students 
the opportunity to learn from the 
leaders in their respective fields — 
but it also provides opportunities 
for students to directly participate 
in research themselves. More than 
1,300 
undergraduate 
students 

assist with faculty research projects 
through 
the 
Undergraduate 

Research Opportunity Program.

As 
a 
sophomore, 
UROP 

enabled me to work on a research 
project for a University law 
school and economics professor. 
That 
experience 
helped 
me 

define an interest in law and 
gave me invaluable experience 
that helped me land internships 
and other opportunities. My 
research sponsor became one of 
my mentors on campus, and his 
guidance helped me define and 
achieve my goal of attending law 
school after graduation.

None of this even dives into the 

fact that both economic theory 
and empirical evidence support 
the notion that federal research 
funding produces direct, tangible 
benefits for the country as a whole. 
In fact, studies show “the return 
on investment for publicly funded 
scientific research and development 
is somewhere between 30 percent 
and 100 percent, or more.” This 
means that for every $1 the 
government spends on research 
funding, society receives $1.30 to $2 
in benefits over time, on average.

On top of all that, these 

research institutions also boost 
the 
state 
economy. 
In 
2012 

alone, Michigan’s three research 
universities generated $16.6 billion 
in economic activity for the state. 
Those numbers do not include 
the economic benefits of longer 
lifespans or higher quality of life 
due to medical or other kinds of 
innovations pioneered at these 
research institutions.

Still not convinced that this 

research funding affects you? 
Just consider the fact that if 

you’re reading this article online, 
federal research funding actually 
facilitated 
the 
technological 

breakthroughs that allow you to 
do that. The internet, lithium-ion 
batteries that power most mobile 
devices and the touchscreens used 
on most cell phones and tablets 
were all products of federally 
funded research.

Federally funded research also 

plays a role in keeping you healthy. 
One study found that 75 percent of all 
discoveries of new molecular entities 
— active ingredients never before 
used in pharmaceuticals — between 
1993 and 2004 were discovered 
thanks to research funded by the 
National Institutes of Health.

All 
of 
this 
funding 
helps 

America maintain its role as a 
global leader in innovation. Yet, 
the Trump administration wants 
to make serious cuts to already 
declining levels of federal funding 
for research. Under Trump’s new 
budget, the National Institutes of 
Health would receive $5.8 billion 
less in funding — about a 20-percent 
cut. The Department of Energy 
also faces a 20-percent cut, while 
the 
Environmental 
Protection 

Agency and National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Agency would see 
an even larger percentage of their 
funding eliminated.

Since Trump apparently likes 

to let billionaires decide how to 
run the government, perhaps 
the president should take advice 
from Bill Gates. Last April, Gates 
penned an op-ed that described 
the 
importance 
of 
federal 

research funding in the microchip 
revolution and, consequently, his 
ability to start Microsoft. Gates also 
called on the federal government 
to 
increase 
federal 
research 

funding if it wants to remain a 
global leader in innovation. Given 
that Gates himself is a global leader 
in innovation, I think he’s probably 
worth listening to on this one.

Interested 
in 
preventing 

the government from actually 
enacting these budget cuts to 
agencies that directly benefit you? 
Consider emulating the advocates 
and ordinary citizens who came 
together to prevent the American 
Health Care Act from passing —
and prevented 24 million people 
from losing their insurance. The 
civic activism of these advocates 
and ordinary citizens certainly 
saved lives. However, there are 
still millions of Americans who 
suffer from diseases that available 
medical treatments can’t cure. 
By telling your representatives 
to avoid cutting funding to the 
agencies that fund scientific and 
medical breakthroughs, you can 
help save lives as well. 

A 

friend 
once 
asked 

me, “Do you think it’s 
possible 
for 
someone 

to be so liberal that they are 
close-minded?” 
My 

immediate 
thought 

was of course not 
— that’s the whole 
point 
of 
being 

liberal. 
When 
you 

and 
your 
friends 

identify as liberal, 
you are fighting for 
human rights, civil 
rights, 
the 
rights 

of 
all 
minorities 

and anyone who is 
against what you think 
is against all of the progress we 
have made in the past 100 years.

And that is when I realized 

the answer is actually yes.

The truth is that as soon as 

you immediately disregard the 
ideas of another group, you are 
close-minded 
by 
definition. 

When one party tells the other 
its views are no longer valid, 
that it is outdated, ignorant 
and offensive, the chance for 
a compromise is lost. This is 
not to say we should allow 
hateful comments to be left to 
spread more hate, but we have a 
responsibility to allow even the 
ideas we do not agree with to be 
heard. I do not believe we were 
always like this, nor do I think 
we intended to become like this. 
But over time, the habit of falling 
back to insults as a way to win 
an argument has overtaken our 
discussion to the point where 
we can no longer even tactfully 
communicate.

Most 
people 
have 
had 

experiences like this — no matter 
where one lies on the political 
spectrum. Heavy conversations 
occur when one individual or 
another stays silent. Because 
being silent is better than 
being personally attacked by 
another who is tearing them 
apart without knowing they are 

insulting the person standing 
right next to them.

We 
saw 
this 
problem 

throughout 
the 
entire 
past 

election cycle. Neither 
side 
would 
allow 

itself 
to 
consider 

any portion of the 
other’s argument, and 
debates were decided 
by the number of 
insults Donald Trump 
or 
Hillary 
Clinton 

could throw at the 
other. However, this 
situation 
did 
not 

happen 
over 
the 

course of one election. 

This has been going on for many 
more years than we even know.

A study published in 2011 on 

250,000 tweets sent out during 
the six weeks leading up to 
the 2010 midterm elections 
found that groups of Twitter 
users who interacted with 
one 
another 
were 
heavily 

segregated 
by 
partisan 

structure 
with 
very 
little 

interaction between the left 
and right users. This means that 
conservatives only interacted 
with other conservatives and 
liberals with other liberals. 
When this isolation happens, 
you get what we saw in 
2016 — two groups that look 
around themselves to only see 
others of the same views, feel 
affirmed, and once again turn 
to the other group and say, “Of 
course you’re wrong; everyone 
knows this.”

What is truly alarming to 

realize is that people have 
seen this happening. The same 
study 
ended 
its 
conclusion 

with, “The fractured nature of 
political discourse seems to be 
worsening, and understanding 
the social and technological 
dynamics underlying this trend 
will be essential to attenuating 
its effect on the public sphere,” 
yet very little has been done 

about it so far.

This is where millennials come 

in. It will be on our shoulders to 
once again bring compromise 
back into a system that has two 
sides that shame those that take 
a middle stance. Whether this 
involves initiating the much-due 
change of the political parties, or 
beginning the elimination of the 
two-party system, we are the next 
generation to take political power. 
The country cannot continue our 
current split mindset.

It is going to be hard. It 

is going to involve having 
uncomfortable 
conversations 

with 
your 
acquaintances, 

friends and family about why 
they believe what they believe. 
Clearly it is not enough to 
simply know what the other side 
believes because it has devolved 
into making assumptions about 
others, which we have seen is 
only detrimental to the progress 
we are seeking.

The type of discussions that 

need to take place need to end 
with members of each side 
admitting they understand the 
other. We do not need to agree, 
but we need to at least give each 
side 
adequate 
consideration 

before 
we 
truly 
decide 
to 

support one ideology.

We are lucky enough to be 

living in a country, and on a 
campus, that was founded on 
the idea of open discussion. 
Let’s make use of this and have 
these difficult conversations. 
I call on those who usually 
speak up first to offer the 
spot to others before they say 
anything. I equally call on 
those who normally go with the 
flow of the conversation to find 
the courage to say their views 
even when they are afraid 
they will be suppressed. Let’s 
bring conversation back to

hy 
might 
we 
be 

happy to do things 
for 
free 
but 
not 

when we are paid to do them? If 
your neighbor asks you to watch 
their dog for a night, you will be 
happy to do it. But if they pay 
you after, you may 
not only be offended 
by the amount, you 
might expect to be 
paid even more next 
time. Humans are 
social animals and 
we are happy to help 
out others. But when 
we are paid for our 
work 
and 
market 

norms enter into the 
scene, social norms 
run out the door.

This is also the case for me. 

Recently, I started working 
in two research labs. One lab 
pays me per hour, and the other 
lab is completely volunteer. 
Intuitively, you might think 
that I’d like the lab that pays me 
per hour — why not get some 
money while doing the work? 
However, the volunteer lab 
offers something that the paid 
lab doesn’t: social exuberance. 
I go out of my way to do extra 
work and the adviser, in return, 
gives me personal mentoring. 
This 
type 
of 
relationship 

doesn’t exist in my paid lab. I’m 
expected to do a certain amount 
of work and leave. 

It is clear that we live in 

two kinds of worlds: social and 
market. In the social world, 
we surround ourselves in a 
community and thrive off of 
social 
relationships. 
In 
the 

market world, “the exchanges 
are sharp-edged,” writes in his 
book, “Predictably Irrational” 
— you only get what you pay for. 
In the money-minded society 
that we live in, it is important to 
keep market norms away from 
social norms and recognize 
that following social norms can 
bring us invaluable profit that 
money simply cannot.

As it turns out, mixing market 

and social norms is like drinking 
orange juice after brushing your 
teeth — it’s not good. Consider 
this example from “Predictably 
Irrational”: A guy takes a girl 
out on multiple dates. By the 
third time, his wallet is thinning 
out and he is hoping to get some 
physical affection. So on the 

fourth date, he decides to tell 
her how much this romance is 
costing him. Her response? She 
calls him a beast and dumps him 
on the spot. (No “Beauty and the 
Beast” happy ending here.)

The trouble was that he failed 

to reconcile between 
market 
and 
social 

norms. By crossing 
the line, he offended 
her 
by 
implying 

that her romance is 
something 
he 
can 

buy. Here is a lesson: 
Do not mention the 
cost of the date if 
you want to impress 
someone. 
In 
fact, 

according to research 

by Kathleen Vohs, Nicole Mead 
and 
Miranda 
Goode, 
even 

thinking about money makes us 
behave differently. Therefore, 
it is likely that money-minded 
intentions will be taken in a 
wrong way.

Life is good when market 

and social norms stay separate. 
However, when they do collide, 
market norms always win and 
the trouble is often permanent. 
Here’s another example from 
“Predictably Irrational”: When 
an Israeli daycare began to fine 
parents for tardy pick-ups, it 
not only made parents later, 
but they also no longer felt 
guilty about it — parents felt as 
though their tardiness could be 
justified with compensation. 
More importantly, even long 
after the school removed the 
fining policy, parents continued 
to pick up their kids late. 
This is the permanent effect 
of market- and social-norm 
collision. Money, though useful 
and necessary, turns out to be 
an ineffective motivator in a 
social context. We sometimes 
forget that money is not the 
answer to social problems, and 
it never will be.

I was made aware of the 

dangers 
of 
mixing 
market 

and social norms a lot more in 
college. With the popular app 
Venmo, people instantly request 
and pay money with friends. For 
example, if you go out for an ice 
cream and your friend doesn’t 
have money on them, you 
purchase the total amount with 
your card, while at the same time 
requesting money from your 
friend on Venmo. Oftentimes, 

I see that people fuss about 
their friends not paying them 
back a few bucks. I’ve also seen 
cases where people won’t hang 
out with their friends until 
their 
Venmo 
requests 
have 

been resolved. I think that this 
obsession with “request and 
pay” is detrimental to building 
long-lasting friendships.

So how do we keep market 

norms out of the equation 
in social relationships? This 
brings us to the notion of 
“give and take” and the power 
of gifting, suggested by Dan 
Ariely. Here’s a similar scenario 
from “Predictably Irrational”: 
Imagine that you invite me 
over for dinner and I decide to 
bring you wine that cost me 
$30. There are a few problems 
with this decision. Maybe you 
don’t like wine and would have 
wanted beer. Or, maybe you 
would want to use that $30 on 
something else. Maybe gifting 
is a waste of money because 
you’re 
spending 
$30 
on 

something else would give just 
as much, if not more, happiness 
as receiving my wine.

But gifting is not a rational 

activity. If I came over and said, 
“I was going to spend $30 on 
wine but I thought you might 
want to spend it on something 
else,” and hand you 30 bucks, 
you 
would 
probably 
think 

that I’m arrogant. Also, from 
my point of view, I would not 
feel 
comfortable 
requesting 

a favor in return when we 
encounter 
each 
other 
next 

time. Though gifts may be 
financially inefficient, “they are 
an important social lubricant,” 
writes Dan Ariely. “Sometimes, 
it turns out, a waste of money 
can be worth a lot.”

So in the case with Venmo 

and the ice-cream shop with 
your wallet-less friend, why not 
you buy the ice cream this time, 
and have your friend get your 
meal next time? If you think 
that your friend is someone 
who has no sense of the social 
norms of give and take, then 
gift them the book “Predictably 
Irrational” and maybe they’ll 
come back around. Remember, 
there’s nothing warmer than 
social reciprocity.

MEGDANOFF

GINA CHOE


Every single morning, I wake 

up to the buzz of my phone alarm. 
Immediately, I check to see a 
myriad of notifications popped 
up on my screen and spend at 
least ten minutes looking through 
each one before I wash up and 
get ready for class. Throughout 
the day, I find myself constantly 
clicking and thumbing through 
Twitter, 
Facebook, 
Snapchat 

and Instagram. Occasionally, I’ll 
stop to look at a striking image or 
funny meme, but more often than 
not, I mindlessly like statuses and 
pictures when scrolling down my 
seemingly endless online feed. My 
browser windows are frequently 
filled to the brim with a ridiculous 
number of tabs. Some contain 
pop culture articles from The 
Guardian, Pitchfork and AV Club, 
while others are just YouTube 
videos of movie trailers and clips of 
old Spongebob episodes.

Through social media, I’m 

constantly connected to current 
events and an online community 
made up of friends and strangers. 

Yet lately, I’ve been feeling a sense 
of disconnect, dread and angst 
from spending such a lengthy 
amount of time on it every day.

For a while, I’ve been thinking 

to myself: How have I become 
so conditioned to compulsively 
check social media? And how I 
can stop? I’ve known for a long 
time that I’ve been obsessed with 
using technology. More recently, 
I’ve been coming to terms with 
the fact that I am psychologically 
and sometimes even emotionally 
dependent on the Internet. It 
distorts the way I perceive myself 
and 
others. 
It 
deprives 
and 

simultaneously 
stimulates 
my 

energy. And, it dilutes my attention 
span when I procrastinate. But for 
some reason, I can’t stop using it.

You’re probably asking yourself 

why I’m talking about this kind 
of issue when the notion of 
social media as “addicting” has 
been scrutinized and discussed 
heavily by psychologists, bloggers 
and skeptics. It’s no secret that 
consuming social media in excess 

has adverse ramifications and I 
don’t intend to lecture people with 
a critical analysis of its damaging 
effects. A show like Netflix’s 
dystopian anthology satire “Black 
Mirror” has already proven that 
its presence in our society is much 
more insidious than we may think. 
And the solution to this problem 
pretty much speaks for itself: just 
stop using social media. But how 
can I, what with having to use my 

computer every single day and 
not feel some sort of inclination 
towards checking my Facebook or 
looking through Instagram on my 
phone when I have “down time”?

There are far more complex 

implications of what it means 

to be “addicted” to social media 
than having it labeled simply as a 
mental health issue, or really as an 
issue at all. It goes deeper than just 
checking on what our friends are 
up to or building this virtual façade 
of our lifestyle for others to see. As 
a generation built on the Internet, 
we have been psychologically 
primed to crave a validation that 
often feels more tangible and 
comfortable online than in real 
life.

There’s an episode from HBO’s 

fantastic, 
underrated 
stoner 

comedy “High Maintenance” that 
addresses such a psychological 
complex. In the episode, a tech-
savvy 20-something named Anja 
(Ismenia Mendes, “The Devil 
You Know”) spends her days 
updating and constructing a self-
deprecating persona on her online 
accounts. 
Later 
on, 
however, 

Anja suffers the consequences 
of her social media obsession 
when she uploads a photo of 
the 
show’s 
nameless 
weed-

dealing protagonist (Ben Sinclair, 

“Sisters”) 
to 
her 
Instagram 

without permission. Towards the 
end of her segment, a dejected Anja 
sits in her bed, alternating between 
a book and her phone, and then she 
just weeps, feeling the hollowness 
of her real life and the life she’s 
made for herself online. 

What the episode, aptly titled 

“Selfie,” reveals is a sobering truth 
about the overwhelming nature of 
being totally lost in the real world 
and finding solace in a place that 
capitalizes on this aimlessness. 
The episode itself might not be 
as nuanced as it should be; the 
commentary on social media is a 
bit didactic and Anja is depicted 
as a somewhat negative stereotype 
of 
a 
social 
media-obsessed 

millennial. 
Nevertheless, 
her 

co-dependent relationship with 
social media rings true to a lot of 
the despair and emotional stress 
that many young people, including 
myself, experience on a day-to-day 
basis. We become dependent on 
social media precisely because it 
gives us a false, romanticized sense 

of comfort, anonymity and power. 
 
 
 
 

So how exactly do we self-

regulate and moderate ourselves 
in using the Internet? Should 
we just continue to be active on 
our social media accounts and 
other realms of the Internet? 
Or should we delete everything, 
go rogue and live under a rock 
like Patrick Star for a while? 
The truth is that being active 
on social media is inevitable, 
especially if you’re a college 
student who writes specifically 
about such a topic every other 
week. I’ll probably still get 
distracted from social media 
when I’m doing my homework 
— hell, I’ve checked Facebook at 
least seven times while writing 
this article. But as addicting as 
it may be, I’m determined to log 
out and close my tabs every now 
and then, and just let the world 
exist around me. After all, life is 
much more enriching in the time 
we spend with others in person 
than with those we connect with 
online.

Even big fans of arthouse 
will find ‘Kuro’ boring

COURTESY OF KURO

Critiquing 
art 
films 
is 

as arduous a task as sitting 
through 
them. 
Of 
course, 

saying this is close-minded, 
anti-intellectual and an easy 
way to get kicked off Daily Arts. 
For me, a decently “cultured” 
moviegoer, there’s often no 
reward for sitting through 
one 
of 
these 

movies. 
Instead, 

I feel stupid for 
not understanding 
what the hell just 
happened on screen 
— a true low blow 
for my fragile ego.

When 
jaded 
by 
the 

traditional 
narrative 

structures and easy-to-follow 
plots 
in 
most 
Hollywood 

pictures, these experimental 
films feel like a different art 
form altogether. And, they are 
indeed. There are almost no 
similarities between the two 
styles, except for the fact that 
both are, in fact, movies. Art 
house cinema isn’t necessarily 
boring; 
it 
just 
requires 
a 

generous amount of patience.

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Film 

Festival is a perfect way to get 
acquainted with this style of 
filmmaking. One of this year’s 
entries is “Kuro,” a Japanese 
movie by Joji Koyama and 
Tujiko Noriko. “Kuro” tells the 
story of Romi, a woman living 
in Paris who cares for her 
paraplegic boyfriend Milou. 
Like many other art films, 
“Kuro” 
includes 
practically 

no dialogue in favor of voice-
over narration. Romi, played 
by Noriko, retells the story 
of their love and its many 
complications. Their tale is 
tragic, yet inspired. Although 
it’s 
difficult 
to 
follow 
at 

moments, some of the stories 
told 
by 
Romi 
are 
heart-

shattering and true testaments 
of the human will.

“Kuro” 
attempts 
to 
tell 

two 
stories: 
one 
through 

the narration, and the other 
through the various shots of 

Romi caring for Milou. A lot 
of the plot is unclear, but it’s 
unfair to critique an art film 
as if it were a more traditional 
major motion picture. The 
deeper 
meaning 
that 
film 

snobs love to ruminate over is 
equally ambiguous, which will 
leave 
these 
aforementioned 

viewers puzzled for weeks. I’ve 
given up trying to understand 
the meaning behind “Kuro,” 
perhaps because I’m a bit 

impatient 
with 
such 

challenging 
stories. 
Nonetheless, 
the movie risks 
being a bit too 
“out-there” for 

even the biggest fans of art 
film.

“Kuro” ’s constant narration 

is complimented by stunning 
shots that forgo any camera 
motion, 
diving 
into 
the 

stillness of the characters’ 
lives. An art film without 
quality cinematography (or, 
any film for that matter) is like 
an Italian pizza pie without 
some succulent cheese; it’s 
never going to be anything 
but 
substandard. 
Still, 
the 

camerawork is one of the only 
engulfing aspects of the movie. 
After a while, the pretty shots 
become background to the 
other lackluster parts of the 
movie.

Directors of experimental 

films like “Kuro” lack anything 
close to the budgets of even the 
most “indie” of indie movies. 
With this comes very little 
financial incentive and little 
payoff for those involved. The 
filmmakers, therefore, must be 
deeply passionate about their 
work in order for the movies 
to stand a chance. Koyama 
and Noriko put forth every 
ounce of passion on the screen. 
However, the result requires 
an ample amount of patience 
and an open-mind.

Although 
I’m 
not 
the 

biggest fan of this genre, 
I’m a firm believer that art 
films challenge the norm and 
influence big-name directors 

to 
also 
push 
cinematic 

boundaries. Without people 
doing the weirdest, strangest 
stuff, the movie industry as a 
whole is more likely to remain 
in a creative lull. “Kuro’s” 
overlapping 
“plots” 
and 

meditative 
cinematography, 

two of the movie’s most special 
qualities, still don’t feel overly 
inventive. Regardless, “Kuro” 
questions 
the 
expectations 

of how a movie should be and 

ultimately defies them.

I’ve always wanted to try 

to understand experimental 
movies and dig into their deeper 
meaning. 
But 
sometimes, 

this is futile, for there’s no 
intellectual concept to grasp at 
all. In many ways, movies are 
purely the most basic form of 
escapism. Watching a movie is 
an experience meant to break 
up the occasional mundanity of 
everyday living. Unfortunately, 
“Kuro” only adds to it.

DakhaBrakha’s unique 
take on Ukranian folk

COURTESY OF DAKHABRAKHA

Distinctive, 
bright, 

unconventional 
and 

passionate, 
Ukrainian 
folk 

band DakhaBrakha is set to 
bring their unique talents to 
Ann Arbor this Wednesday, 
March 29 at the Michigan 
Theater.

Bill Smith, founder of Riot 

Artists 
and 
DakhaBrakha’s 

North 
American 
agent, 

discovered the quartet at a 
concert in Greece about five 
years ago.

“Everybody in the audience 

was mesmerized,” Smith said.

Formed in 2004 at the 

Kyiv Center of Contemporary 
Art in Ukraine by Vladislav 
Troitskyi, 
an 
avant-garde 

theater director, DakhaBrakha 
combines the simple tenacity 
of their voices with hints of 
varied artistic influences to 
create an original performance 
experience.

In 
spite 
of 
the 
group’s 

limited English, their artistry 
transcends typical language 
barriers. They’re influenced 
by sounds from around the 
world, at once both familiar 
and 
authentically 
foreign. 

Their name stems from old 
Ukrainian, meaning “give / 
take,” and that’s exactly what 
their music does.

“I would rely on what they 

call an ‘ethno-chaos,’” Smith 
said. “It is quite a mixture 
of genres. It’s based on long-
forgotten Ukrainian folk songs 
that they have revived … they 
have re-arranged them with a 
multitude of other influences, 
whether it’s rap, jazz (or) 
classical, 
while 
retaining 

the 
basic 
folkloric 
music. 

It’s clearly recognizable, but 
they changed it in a way that 
absolutely inspires the public.”

A small and powerful force, 

DakhaBrakha 
consists 
of 

musicians Marko Halanevych 
(vocals, 
darbuka, 
tabla, 

didjeridoo, 
accordion, 

trombone), Iryna Kovalenko 
(vocals, djembe, bass drums, 
accordion, percussion, bugay, 
zgaleyka, 
piano), 
Olena 

Tsybulska (vocals, bass drums, 
percussion, garmoshka) and 
Nina Garenetska (vocals, cello, 
bass drum).

“They 
start 
off 
very 

dramatically, and the tempo 
changes throughout,” Smith 
said. “I can’t say that I have a 
favorite part of their concerts 

because it’s all so well put-
together … so many presenters 
have told me that they’re 
the highlight of their entire 
season, and a few of them have 
said (they’re) the highlight of 
their careers.”

Their music has a quiet, 

incomparable force to it; it’s 
inherently captivating.

“It’s 
fundamentally 

Ukrainian, Eastern European 
folkloric 
music. 
It’s 
so 

accessible 
that 
people 
in 

Mexico 
described 
a 
show 

there as a ‘rave.’ Other people 
see it differently,” Smith said. 
“It takes maybe five or ten 
minutes into the concert for 
the public to grasp it if they’ve 
never seen the group, and then 
they simply embrace it and go 
wild. It’s amazing how they 
stir the public.”

Somewhat 
ethereal 
in 

nature, 
their 
vocals 
are 

accompanied 
by 
layers 
of 

beads and tall, woolen hats, 
allowing DakhaBrakha to craft 
a visually stunning concert 
that’s difficult to look away 
from.

Some of their pieces are 

slower, 
sharply 
contrasting 

with the intensity of others 
and lending a depth to their 
performances. One of their 
more popular tracks, “Baby,” 
from 
their 
2014 
album 

Light, 
sits 
comfortably 
at 

about 
seven 
minutes 
long. 

Seemingly narrating a story 
through unfiltered emotion, 
it’s hopeful when it needs to 
be and dangerous when it so 
desires.

The 
song 
embodies 

the 
evolutionary 
feel 
of 

DakhaBrakha’s 
music: 
The 

band is able to communicate 
a 
story 
that 
reaches 
all 

audiences 
no 
matter 
the 

langauge differences. Riding 
on 
the 
strength 
of 
their 

sound, the group uses their 
performances to universally 
attach themselves to those 
around — watching, listening, 
feeling.

Strange, 
thoughtful 
and, 

at 
times, 
other-worldly, 

DakhaBrakha’s performance is 
sure to be memorable. With an 
artistic vision as idiosyncratic 
as theirs and gripping vocals 
to match, it’s best to approach 
the night with open hearts 
and minds. Resting atop the 
foundation of pure love imbued 
in 
DakhaBrakha’s 
concerts, 

this Ukrainian quartet is set to 
share their joy with Ann Arbor 
this Wednesday.

We often forget how male-

dominated stand-up comedy is. 
While there are a few exceptions 
— Amy Schumer, Ali Wong, 
Chelsea 
Handler, 

Aparna 
Nancherla, 

Tig 
Notaro, 
Jen 

Kirkman 
— 
the 

general 
makeup 

of 
the 
stand-up 

comedy industry is 
predominantly male. 
According to a 2015 statistic from 
online blog Bitch Media, women 
only make up 14.3 percent of 
performers, though that number 
has increased since then. In a 
2014 article from the Huffington 
Post, Lynne Parker, founder of the 
Funny Women Awards, noted this 
gender disparity isn’t necessarily 
due to the lack of female talent, but 
more with regards to women not 
being given enough opportunities.

There has always been a clear 

lack of female visibility within 
the comedy industry, especially 
on television, where FX’s “Louie” 
and HBO’s “Crashing” feature 
male stand-up comedians and 
their quests to make people laugh. 
Amazon’s “The Marvelous Mrs. 
Maisel,” the new 1950s screwball 
comedy from “Gilmore Girls” 
creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, 
challenges that idea and the male 
hegemony of stand-up comedy 
with a story about a female comic.

Like the stand-up act of its 

novice but talented protagonist, 
“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” 
starts off a bit shaky, but slowly 
gains traction once it gets to the 
good stuff.

Rachel 
Brosnahan 
(“House 

of Cards”) stars in what could 

be her breakout role as Miriam 
“Midge” Maisel, a spunky and 
sophisticated Jewish housewife 
from the Upper West Side with a 
knack for entertaining people with 
jokes. Initially, she supports her 
devoted husband Joel (Michael 
Zegen, “Boardwalk Empire”) in his 
side career as a stand-up comedian. 

But after a falling 
out between the 
two, Midge takes 
matters into her 
own hands, using 
her 
newfound 

autonomy to put 
her comedic chops 

to the test.

Along 
with 
its 
spectacular 

cast, smart script, impeccable 
production design and captivating 
characters, “The Marvelous Mrs. 
Maisel” also works as a clever 
social commentary with feminist 
undertones. Instead of portraying 
overt finger-wagging or heavy-
handed denouncements of sexism 
in the late 1950s, the show avoids 
clichés by focusing on Midge’s 
journey from domestic homemaker 
to an independent woman. 

Initially, Midge isn’t seeking to 

be a stand-up comic, though the 
opening sequence, in which she 
gives her own toast at her wedding, 
seems to show a secret desire for 
the profession. Later on, when 
she discovers Joel stealing an act 
from comedian Bob Newhart, 
Midge suggests coming up with 
an original idea, which leads Joel 
to doing an awkward, stale set and 
eventually admitting his affair 
with his secretary. Even when a 
devastated Midge asks for help 
from her tempestuous father Abe 
(Tony Shalhoub, “Monk”) and 
mother Rose (Marin Hinkle, “Two 
and a Half Men”), she is coerced 
into finding Joel to win him back.

As the show gradually pulls away 

layer after layer, Midge becomes 
more and more complex, showing 
us that she is more than just the 
thoughtful, 
caring 
housewife 

and mother Joel and her parents 
want her to be. This is mostly 
a credit to Brosnahan, whose 
three-dimensional 
performance 

deftly balances between buoyant 
confidence and vulnerability. 

While 
Sherman-Palladino’s 

trademark for fast-paced dialogue 
and punchy one-liners propels the 
story forward, “The Marvelous 
Mrs. Maisel” truly shines in its 
quieter moments. In an early scene, 
a dolled-up Midge sneaks out of 
bed to roll up her hair and put on 
a face mask, but wakes up just in 
time to do her makeup again, as 
if nothing had happened. This 
moment, as insignificant as it may 
seem, demonstrates just the kind 
of expectations Midge is forced to 
conform to in order to be seen as 
the pristine, perfect housewife. 

Granted, “The Marvelous Mrs. 

Maisel” falters in some aspects. 
Sherman-Palladino’s 
continues 

to incorporate her hallmark pop 
culture references, but the esoteric, 
somewhat 
antiquated 
humor 

might not land with every viewer. 
Occasionally, the show teeters 
into formulaic territory, such as 
when Midge interacts with famed 
comedian Lenny Bruce (Luke 
Kirby, “Take This Waltz”) towards 
the end of the episode. The pilot is 
also a bit long, clocking in at about 
an hour. But perhaps if it’s picked 
up for a full season — the episode is 
one of several in Amazon’s annual 
pilot season — “The Marvelous 
Mrs. Maisel” will definitely find 
ways to improve on its flaws and 
expand on its best qualities. It might 
even help pave the way for female 
stand-up comedians to finally get 
the platform they deserve on and 
off television.

SINGLES REVIEW

Nearly six years since their last 
album, Gorillaz return with four 
singles that signal a step toward 
a dancier, more mainstream 
influence. The “band” — actually 
one real player, Damon Albarn, 
and four virtual members — con-
tinue their trend of integrating 
progressive genre trends with 
emerging talents.
In the first and arguably best 
single, “Ascension,” the band 
recruits conscious rapper Vince 
Staples to lend a political tinge 
to the club banger. The track is 
produced by the typical Gorillaz 
duo — Remi Kabaka and Damon 
Albarn — but gains its dance-
floor appeal from Anthony “The 
Twilite Tone” Khan. With a 
track record of songs like Kanye 
West’s “Mercy” and “Don’t 
Like.1,” Khan is likely respon-
sible for elevating the track to 
its current commercial appeal. 
Staples offers his uniquely 
danceable-yet-meaningful lyri-
cism (see “Norf Norf”), having 
people grooving while he talks 
about how “This the land of the 
free / Where you can get a Glock 
and a gram for the cheap.” The 

track not only features produc-
tion curated for hip hop chart 
success, but at two minutes and 
35 seconds, it’s the perfect length 
to crossover to mainstream 
radio.
In “Saturn Barz,” the band con-
tinues to embrace recent trends, 
enlisting dancehall icon (and 

frequent Drake collaborator) 
Popcaan. The track is quintes-
sentially Gorillaz — laced with 
dark beats, Popcaan alternates 
verses with Damon’s classic 
heavily distorted vocals. What 
makes the song stand-out is the 
unexpected nature of Popcaan’s 
feature: The beat is far removed 
from the steel drum percussion 
of Popcaan’s personal discog-
raphy, creating an unlikely, yet 
successful, pairing. The juxta-
position of Popcaan’s usually 
reggae-influenced lyricism with 
the Gorillaz’s deep underground 

hip-hop beats create a pairing 
that’s worth a listen.
In contrast to “Saturn Barz,” 
the third single “Andromeda” is 
heavily dance-influenced. With 
rapper D.R.A.M. contributing, 
the track is the house-iest Goril-
laz song yet; slowly layering beat 
over beat, the single does groovy 
dance music so well that it could 
have Chromeo on production. 
The disparity between “Saturn 
Barz” and “Andromeda” is great, 
leaving listeners interested to 
see how Albarn ties the project 
together.
The last single, “We Got the 
Power,” featuring Jehnny Beth 
of Savages, is hardly listenable. 
Perhaps the single would be bet-
ter received if not on a Gorillaz 
album, but it’s overly empower-
ing lyrics and lackluster beat are 
nauseating, making you almost 
believe it’s a farce of a pop song 
(which it could very well be). 
When considered in context of 
a full album, the song may make 
more sense … hopefully. Stay 
tuned for the full album release 
on April 28th to find out.

COURTESY OF THE MODERN JUNGLE

‘The Modern Jungle’ is an 
odd look at globalization

The line between 

a 
film 
being 

experimental 
and 

a film just being 
weird is often pretty 
thin. “The Modern 
Jungle” 
straddles 

that line. Ostensibly 
telling 
the 
story 

of don Juan (Juan 
Juarez 
Rodriquez) 
and 
his 

neighbor 
Carmen 
(Carmen 

Echevarria Lopez), this film is 
part documentary, part narrative, 
part spiritual journey and only 
partway to giving the audience a 
reason to care.

The film opens in a theater, 

and we soon realize the film we 
are watching is in fact just the 
first of several framing devices 
used to compound the story. 
There are spiritual sequences, 
dream sequences, a four minute 
long 
advertisement 
for 
the 

corporation that is the supposed 
villain of the piece and two main 
characters who stumble through 
it all — narrative and cohesion be 
damned, all in the name of art.

“The 
Modern 
Jungle” 

professes 
to 
be 
about 

industrialization, 
globalization, 

and the ways in which these 
things can impact real people at 
the ground level. And while there 

are parts of the film that clearly 
touch on that, there are also long 
stretches of disjointed scenes and 
actions that seem to connect to 

each other in no 
discernible way. 
The director of 
the film, Charles 
Fairbanks 
(“Pioneers), 
explained 
afterwards 
that 

some 
scenes 

were 
filmed 

documentary style with some 
aspects done up and faked for 
the camera. Without knowing 
which scenes are which, it’s hard 
for this film to succeed as either a 
documentary or a piece of fiction. 
If the audience does not know 
what was real and what wasn’t, 
then how can it interpret the 
thing it is watching on the screen?

A number of scenes feature 

Juan talking directly to the 
camera for long stretches with 
no 
response. 
These 
scenes 

are truly uncomfortable and 
confusing to watch as a viewer, 
and no indication is given of who 
he is talking to or why no one is 
responding to him. At the time it 
seemed that he was supposed to 
be talking to one of his employers 
at the corporation, but Fairbanks 
later confirmed that in fact this 
was Juan talking to Fairbanks, 
who said for a variety of reasons 
he did not want to respond. This 

sequence only adds another layer 
to the confusing whole that is 
“The Modern Jungle” rendering 
the audience utterly baffled.

As a work of experimental art, 

the film can safely say it succeeds 
in being experimental, but to the 

detriment of possible enjoyment 
an audience could gain from it. 
It’s hard not to wonder what 
the point of it all is, and when 
the director later confirms that, 
“There really was no specific 
message I wanted to convey,” the 
viewer is left leaving the theater 
with countless questions, but only 
one that truly matters: What did I 
just watch?

‘M’ defeats UMBC, 
continues hot start

Coming off a bye week 

following a run of three wins 
in a row, the No. 20 Michigan 
men’s lacrosse team defeated 
Maryland-Baltimore County by 
a final score of 10-7 on Saturday 
afternoon.

In its first game since the 

biggest win in the program’s 
history — a 13-12 victory against 
No. 10 Penn — Michigan (8-1) 
was able to avoid a letdown and 
outlast the Retrievers (3-5). 
With 
a 
pair 

of early goals 
from 
senior 

midfielder 
Mikie 
Schlosser, 
the 

Wolverines 
took a 2-0 lead 
early in the first 
quarter, which 
left 
UMBC 

fighting 
from 

behind for the 
rest of the game.

“We have a lot of respect for 

UMBC,” said Michigan coach 
John Paul. “They’re a very good 
team and they’ve been playing 
really well recently. We kind 
of had a feeling the way they 
play that this was gonna be a 
game we’d really have to gut 
out. More than anything, I’m 
just really proud of the guys for 
doing what we needed to do to 
get the W and move on.” 

As has been the theme for 

much of the regular season, the 
Wolverines were led by their 
three-star 
offensive 
players, 

sophomore 
attacker 
Brent 

Noseworthy (the team’s leading 
scorer for the season) senior 
attacker Ian King and Schlosser. 
The trio provided the offense 
needed for the victory. King 
and Noseworthy each tallied 
three goals on the afternoon, 
combining 
with 
Schlosser’s 

early pair for eight of the team’s 
10 goals.

“Mikie kind of put us on his 

back at the start, and he brings 

so much energy to us,” Paul 
said. “Our theme today was to 
start and finish. I’m glad to see 
that start.”

After controlling much of 

the first half and taking a 6-4 
lead into halftime, Michigan 
saw UMBC find its way back 
into the game in the middle of 
the third quarter. A three-goal 
lead was trimmed to one as the 
Retrievers began to find their 
offensive momentum with goals 
from Max Maxwell and Max 
Haldeman.

The following five minutes 

were extremely 
tense 
for 
the 

Wolverines, 
as 

they 
attempted 

to prevent the 
Retrievers from 
tying the game 
up. 
Finally, 

Noseworthy 
restored 
the 

multi-goal 
lead 

by 
completing 

his hat trick with 

four seconds remaining in the 
third quarter, and King iced 
the game with 5:03 remaining 
in the fourth quarter before 
completing his own hat trick 
with 1:01 left to finish the 
scoring for the Wolverines.

The 
well-rounded 

performance offered a great 
tune-up as the Wolverines 
embark on a final stretch of 
six games that feature five 
ranked opponents to conclude 
the regular season. As the 
young program has achieved a 
national ranking for the first 
time in its existence, figuring 
out how to put away winnable 
games before they get tight 
is essential for the ascent to 
continue.

“We stick with what works 

for us (when the game tightens 
up), working the ball around, 
getting a look and making the 
shots that we need to make,” 
Noseworthy said. “Once we 
played our game, we really 
calmed it down, and we have a 
chance against any team.” 

Michigan bench gains experience in blowout

While the Michigan baseball 

team’s 12-0 victory over Toledo 
(0-3 Mid-American Conference, 
5-19 overall) was just another 
day at the office for the starters, 
it was an eye-opening game for 
the Wolverine’s bench. 

“It’s two-fold,” said Michigan 

coach Erik Bakich. “Number 
one, it helps them because it 
gives 
them 
repetitions 
and 

opportunities 
to 
compete. 

And number two, it gives the 
starters, who have been in there 
every inning of every game, a 
little bit of a breather … We want 
to be able to take advantage of 
that and keep those guys fresh 
for the entire year.”

Once the Wolverines (1-2 

Big Ten, 18-6 overall) took a 
substantial lead, Bakich decided 
to use the comfortable margin to 
play some players who had just 
a few appearances this season. 
Five fielders — who had just 10 
appearances combined prior to 

Tuesday — were substituted in 
the game. 

The standout bench player 

was junior catcher Brock Keener, 
who came in to relieve junior 
catcher Drew Lugbauer behind 
the plate. In just his second 
at-bat in a Michigan uniform, 
Keener notched his first hit as a 
Wolverine with a single through 
the right side, earning his first 
run batted in as well.

Keener’s 
hit 
earned 

Michigan’s 
10th 
run 
and 

propelled the Wolverines to tack 
on two more before the end of 
the inning.

“Everything matters,” Keener 

said. “Not saying practice doesn’t 
matter, 
but 
you 
contribute 

towards the wins and losses. 
The game’s sped up a little bit 
and instead of playing against 
your team, everybody’s all going 
towards the same mission.”

But 
besides 
Keener, 
the 

bench’s hitting was off the mark. 

Redshirt freshman infielder 

George Hewitt appeared in just 
two games this season and had 

only one at-bat previously. His 
inexperience showed when he 
struck out twice.

While 
the 
field 
didn’t 

experience much action due 
to the lack of offense in the 
Rockets’ 
lineup, 
there 
was 

still an opportunity to see new 
pitchers go to work.

Freshman 
right-hander 

Karl 
Kauffman 
made 
three 

appearances for Michigan prior 
to the game’s matchup, but had 
his best game yet against Toledo. 
He came in to relieve junior 
right-hander Jayce Vancena on 
the bump at the start of the sixth 
inning.

Kauffman 
opened 
action 

against the Rockets with three 
straight strikeouts to retire the 
side. Immediately, he earned a 
new career high in strikeouts 
per game — a record he would 
add to in the next inning.

He has appeared in 3.1 innings 

this season and almost doubled 
that in one outing by pitching 
2.0 more Tuesday.

With the last two innings 

approaching 
and 
Toledo 

unlikely to make a comeback, 
the 
Wolverines 
brought 
in 

redshirt sophomore left-hander 
Grant Reuss. 

Reuss had pitched in just 1.1 

innings this season, but has 
managed to make his mark in 
what little playing time he has 
received. He had four strikeouts 
this season and added two 
more in the one inning that he 
pitched.

“Grant Reuss looked very 

good in his inning,” Bakich said. 
“He’s a junior now and really 
struggled with command his 
first couple years, and he’s done 
a very nice job of commanding 
his fastball in all the outings 
that he’s had so far this season.

“He’s a guy that is very much 

improved and looks very good 
out there on the mound.”

While it remains to be seen 

when these reserves will see 
the field again, experiences like 
the one they got against Toledo 
could prove to be vital as the 
season progresses. 

Wolverines survive against Central Michigan

In its series finale against 

Penn State on Sunday, the 
Michigan 
softball 
team’s 

offense exploded, scoring a 
season-high 17 runs on 13 hits. 
Yet 
amidst 
the 
ballooning 

production 
and 
excitement, 

Kelly Christner wasn’t herself 
at the plate, and hadn’t been for 
a while. 

Despite the Wolverines’ big 

game, the senior centerfielder 
had only one hit on the entire 
weekend. After starting the 
season on an offensive tear — 
22 runs batted in over the first 
22 games — Christner didn’t 
collect another RBI for two 
weeks, stuck in an offensive 
slump.

But Tuesday, not only did 

Christner make her presence at 
the plate known again, she was 
Michigan’s sole saving grace 
offensively.

Christner 
went 
2-for-2 

against Central Michigan (2-1 
Mid-American 
Conference, 

17-9 
overall), 
contributing 

both of the Wolverines’ RBI, 
with a third-inning solo shot 
to right field and a single up 
the middle in the fifth frame. 
Her production lifted No. 20 
Michigan (3-0 Big Ten, 23-7-1 
overall) past the Chippewas, 
2-0, in a midweek pitcher’s 
duel en route to the Wolverines’ 
ninth-straight victory.

“(Christner) was just locked 

in,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 

Carol Hutchins. “We needed 
somebody to come through for 
us, and we’re very pleased that 
Kelly did.”

Amidst its short one-game 

break from Big Ten competition, 
Michigan appeared to have 
backtracked — dealing with 
many of the same struggles 
that plagued the team early on 
in the season. The Wolverines 
demonstrated 
weak 
swings 

at the plate and did not have 
a hit until the third inning, 

leaving 
numerous 
runners 

stranded on base. These flaws 
were 
underscored 
in 
the 

seventh inning, when despite 
loading the bases with no outs, 
Michigan couldn’t score.

“We really couldn’t seem to 

get our kids to lock in and to 
stay with the game plan to try 
to drive our outside pitch to 
the righties,” Hutchins said. 
“We took a lot of really feeble 
swings, not what we’ve been 
working on, and not what I 
think we’ve gotten better at. We 
really didn’t look like we had a 
great edge to play today.”

Despite the poor offensive 

performance, the Wolverines 
still ended the game with a 
victory 
due 
to 
Christner’s 

RBI. A pair of hits and a single 
posted by senior shortstop Abby 
Ramirez and sophomore catcher 
Alex 
Sobczak, 
respectively, 

were Michigan’s only other hits 
on the day.

Central Michigan, on the 

other hand, couldn’t find a way 

onto the scoreboard. Aware 
that the Chippewas would start 
ace right-hander Rachel Knapp 
— who touts 135 strikeouts on 
the season — Hutchins decided 
to pitch senior right-hander 
Megan Betsa for a second-
straight game.

“They pitched their ace,” 

Hutchins said. “And we pitched 
ours.”

And as Hutchins’ prediction 

of intensity from the opposition 
in the circle and a low-scoring 
game became reality, Betsa 
verified that she was primed for 
the job. 

The 
senior 
right-hander 

threw 
her 
fifth 
straight 

complete-game 
shutout, 

delivering nine strikeouts and 
allowing only one hit. The 
ace has found her groove as of 
late, striking out 68 batters and 
allowing no runs over her past 
36 innings in the circle.

Her prowess shined in the 

third inning, striking out the 
side, and then again in the 
fourth when she got out of 
a two-runner, one-out jam, 
tossing back-to-back strikeouts 
that allowed the Wolverines to 
leave the frame unscathed.

“Honestly, 
(Betsa) 
did 

amazing, which isn’t unusual 
for her,” Christner said. “She 
goes out there and just attacks 
them from the start, and it 
really just sets the tone.” 

Though Michigan managed 

to escape the game through the 
tenacity of Betsa and Christner, 
the Wolverines will need more 
contributions 
throughout 

the lineup when they face 
tougher opponents. They know 
that relying on a sole player 
to produce offensively is an 
unsustainable practice. 

“I think we could have made 

an 
adjustment 
(to 
Knapp) 

earlier,” Christner said. “You 
need to know what (the pitcher) 
is going to throw you and what 
her process is. We have to find 
better ways to get on base, find 
longer at-bats and find better 
at-bats overall.”

WOMEN’S TRACK AND FIELD
‘M’ contributes to win
in Pac-12/B1G challenge

With 
a 
series 
of 
solid 

individual performances, the 
Michigan women’s track and 
field team helped the Big Ten 
win in the Pac-12 vs. Big Ten 
Challenge. 

With 
their 
57 
points, 

the 
Wolverines 
finished 

considerably behind first-place 
Nebraska’s 142, finishing eighth 
out of eight teams overall in the 
tournament.

Junior Claire Kieffer-Wright 

led 
the 
way 

for 
Michigan 

with her 1.75-
meter jump in 
the high-jump, 
enough to finish 
first after a tie-
break.

“I 
always 

enjoy it when 
I get to open 
up my season 
pretty strong,” 
Kieffer-Wright said.

Kieffer-Wright was able to 

bring home the victory after 
neither her nor her opponents 
were able to clear the 1.78-
meter jump. Since she had fewer 
misses throughout the day she 
was awarded the win.

“She’s just a workhorse,” 

said Wolverines’ coach James 
Henry. “She’s willing to work 
hard … (and) set an example as 
a captain.”

Kieffer-Wright’s consistently 

solid 
performances 
are 

especially impressive given that 
she is also a part of Michigan’s 
volleyball team.

While Henry said that this 

commitment has taken a toll on 
her body, he praised her ability 
to balance both sports.

Kieffer-Wright was not the 

only Wolverine to have a good 
showing. Junior Aaron Howell 
followed 
her 
teammate’s 

victory, finishing third in the 
high jump with her 1.70-meter 
jump. Juniors Claire Borchers 
and 
Sydney 
Badger, 
along 

with redshirt freshman Meg 
Darmofal, finished 5-6-7 in the 
1,500-meter run.

Freshman 
Jade 
Harrison 

finished fourth in the 100-meter 
run, starting her outdoor season 
strong after a very good first 
indoor season with Michigan.

Despite the series of good 

performances, Henry stressed 
that he was not increasing his 
expectations of her.

With 
some 

athletes 
sitting 

out 
after 

competing in the 
NCAA 
Indoor 

Championships 
two weeks ago, 
the 
challenge 

also 
served 

as 
a 
good 

opportunity 
for many of the 
younger athletes 

to compete.

While the transition from 

indoor to outdoor takes place 
over 
a 
short 
time-period, 

neither Henry nor Kieffer-
Wright viewed the shift as 
particularly difficult.

“It’s a lot of the same,” 

Kieffer-Wright said. “You strive 
for your best every meet.”

Henry 
also 
stressed 
the 

importance of recovering and 
rehab after a tough finish to the 
indoor season.

“We’ve got to do well in the 

long-term,” he said.

With a good start to the 

outdoor season behind her, 
Kieffer-Wright 
— 
a 
bronze 

medalist at last year’s Big Ten 
Outdoor 
Championship 
— 

stressed that her focus remains 
on contributing to her team, 
saying “as long as I can score 
points for my team, that’s all 
that really matters to me.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL
Walton selected for 
3-point competition

It may not be for the reason 

that he hoped, but Derrick 
Walton Jr. is going to Phoenix, 
Ariz. after all.

The field for the 29th State 

Farm College Slam Dunk & 
3-Point 
Championships 
was 

announced Tuesday afternoon, 
and Michigan’s senior point 
guard found his name among the 
eight-player group that will be 
competing in the event’s 3-point 
contest. The event will take place 
at 10 p.m. on Thursday, March 
30 at Grand Canyon University 
Arena, and will be aired on 
ESPN. It will also feature the 
dunk contest and the women’s 
3-point contest.

Walton will be competing 

against UCLA’s Bryce Alford, 
Arizona State’s Torian Graham, 
Villanova’s Kris Jenkins, Iowa’s 
Peter Jok, Duke’s Matt Jones, 
Iowa State’s Nazareth Mitrou-
Long 
and 
Grand 
Canyon’s 

DeWayne Russell.

This 
season, 
Walton 

notched a team-high 98 made 
3-pointers — good for the 
third-best single season mark 
in Michigan’s program history. 
He also notched a 42.2 field goal 
percentage from beyond the 
arc, second only behind Duncan 
Robinson (42.4) among players 
who attempted more than 100 
shots from 3-point range.

Walton’s long-range shooting 

was a significant improvement 
from his junior season, during 
which he made just 63 treys and 
shot 38.7 percent from beyond 
the arc.

Thursday 
will 
mark 
the 

final time that Walton has an 
opportunity to represent the 
Wolverines. He finishes his 
career as the only Michigan 
player to record at least 1,000 
points, 500 rebounds and 400 
assists in a career, having played 
127 total games. Walton also 
finished with 499 assists — good 
for fourth in program history — 
and claimed the single-game 
assist record with his 16-assist 
performance against Nebraska 
on March 5.

Wolverines one game shy of WNIT final

If it’s true that those who 

forget the past are doomed to 
repeat it, then it’s time that the 
Michigan women’s basketball 
team sharpens its memory.

On Wednesday night, the 

Wolverines (11-5 Big Ten, 26-9 
overall) 
will 

host Villanova 
(11-7 Big East, 
20-14) 
at 

Crisler Center 
in 
what 
is 

Michigan’s 
third straight 
trip 
to 
the 

Women’s 
National 
Invitation 
Tournament 
semifinals 
— 

a 
game 
the 

Wolverines 
have 
lost 

the last two 
seasons. 
With 
an 

NCAA Tournament snub still 
on their minds, Michigan is 
just two games away from 
claiming their first WNIT 
Championship and proving the 
Selection Committee wrong. 
The Wolverines have already 
put up a legitimate case with 
four convincing WNIT wins.

“Our 
team 
is 
probably 

playing 
some 
of 
the 
best 

basketball it (has) played all 
season long,” said Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes Arico after 
Saturday’s 
quarterfinals 

win over Virginia Tech. “I 
think our chemistry has been 
outstanding, and I think people 
have picked up the slack and 
picked up the minutes.”

The Wildcats, though, are 

coming off of an impressive 
69-57 victory over Indiana, 
where they hit 10 first-half 
3-pointers. While their 3-point 
shooting was impressive, it 
has been sporadic at times 
this season — Villanova ranks 
in the bottom third of scoring 

offenses in Division I. The 
Wildcats’ offense is generated 
by 
how 
they 
value 
each 

possession, as they boast the 
fewest turnovers per game in 
the country (9.5).

“(Villanova 
is) 
really 

a 
3-point 

shooting team, 
they have five 
people that can 
shoot 
threes,” 

Barnes 
Arico 

said. 
“They 

run a lot flare 
screens, motion 
offense, 
five 

out. … It’s very 
difficult 
to 

defend, and I 
can see why a 
lot of teams have had a tough 
matchup with them thus far.

“They’re 
an 
interesting 

matchup for us. We’ve gotta 
try to play our style and still 
be able to get out in defensive 
transition, we’ve gotta try to 
offensive rebound a little bit 

to give ourselves some more 
possessions 
and 
limit 
our 

turnovers.”

Villanova’s 
backcourt 
of 

Alex 
Louin 
and 
Adrianna 

Hahn could pose problems 
for the Wolverines, who have 

been 
juggling 

their 
guard 

play 
in 
light 

of 
freshman 

guard 
Kysre 

Gondrezick’s 
absence 
for 

personal 
reasons. 
The 

duo 
comprises 

nearly half of 
the 
Wildcats’ 

scoring and is 
their 
greatest 

threat beyond the arc. The 
Wildcats 
are 
efficient 
on 

the defensive side of the ball 
however, surrendering just 61.6 
points per game. But stodgy 
low-post defense has plagued 
them in the past — getting 
nearly doubled in points in 

the paint against Creighton 
and Mississippi State earlier 
this season, for example — and 
will be especially vulnerable 
against 
Michigan’s 
potent 

offense.

The 
Wolverines 
typically 

best teams with their 3-point 
shooting — which ranks fifth 
in the nation — but to beat 
the Wildcats they will have 
to generate offense down low, 
something Michigan is not 
unfamiliar with. Sophomore 
center Hallie Thome has a 
three-inch height advantage 
over Villanova’s tallest player, 
and has been turning up in the 
WNIT, boasting 20.5 points per 
game in her last four contests.

The Wolverines have had 

a 
program 
record-breaking 

season with 26 victories thus 
far, and a win over the Wildcats 
would put them just one step 
closer to doing something that 
they have never done before: 
hang a banner in the Crisler 
Center rafters. 

Michigan’s offense explodes in rout of Toledo

The No. 22 Michigan baseball 

team’s Big Ten opening series at 
Maryland last weekend didn’t 
exactly go 
according 
to 
plan, 

as 
the 

Wolverines dropped two out of 
three games to the Terrapins. 
But Tuesday told a totally 
different story, as Michigan put 
on a picture-perfect display. 

In their return to Ray Fisher 

Stadium, just about everything 
went right for the Wolverines 
against Toledo, as Michigan 
(1-2 Big Ten, 18-6 overall) 
cruised past the overmatched 
Rockets 
(0-3 
Mid-American 

Conference, 5-19) for a 12-0 
victory.

The Wolverines’ offense was 

the star, as Michigan put up 
its highest scoring total since 
defeating Loyola Marymount, 
14-2, 
on 
March 
1. 
Junior 

catcher Drew Lugbauer went 
3-for-4 with three runs batted 
in and senior centerfielder 
Johnny Slater contributed with 
two hits and three RBI to lead a 
15-hit, 10-walk onslaught.

However, big moments on 

defense were what set the tone 
before the Wolverines got on 
the scoreboard. Slater slid to 
make a basket catch for the 
game’s first out, and in the 
second inning, sophomore left 
fielder Miles Lewis sprawled 
to the turf to catch a hard-hit 
liner.

“It doesn’t just affect the 

hitters, it affects the pitchers 
too,” said junior first basemen 
Jake Bivens, who went 3-for-5 
with two stolen bases. “When 
they’re working their butts 
off and throwing good pitches 
it’s good to make plays behind 
them, and that carries over to 
offense to string quality at-bats 
together.”

That’s 
exactly 
what 

happened in the bottom half 
of the second inning, when 
Michigan had four singles, 
two walks and two stolen 
bases. 
Sophomore 
second 

baseman Ako Thomas put the 

Wolverines on the scoreboard 
first by drawing a bases-loaded 
walk and later scored on senior 
shortstop Michael Brdar’s two-
out, two-run single to center. 
Lugbauer kept the inning going 
for the Wolverines with an RBI 
single to right field, forcing a 
Toledo pitching change and 
putting Michigan ahead early, 
4-0.

After impressing in his first 

start of the season last week 
against 
Western 
Michigan, 

starting 
right-hander 
Jayce 

Vancena was sharp again. The 
junior was commanding and 
methodical, striking out six 
batters and throwing just 56 
pitches in five innings, 42 of 
which went for strikes. Most 
notably, he didn’t surrender a 
single walk, and has yet to do 
so in 21 innings this season.

“He lets his defense work, 

and he’s very efficient with his 
pitches,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “He gets to strike 
one and strike two very quickly. 
Position players like playing 

defense behind him because he 
keeps them engaged because he 
forces contact. He’s not a guy 
that nibbles — he works fast 
and gets action behind him.”

After two scoreless innings 

on both sides, Michigan struck 
in the fifth inning. Bivens, who 
had led off the 
second 
inning 

with a single, 
kickstarted 
the Wolverines 
again, 
ripping 

a 
line 
drive 

between center 
and right field 
for 
a 
leadoff 

double. After a 
walk and a hit 
batter, Thomas 
and Slater hit back-to-back 
singles with the bases loaded 
to drive in three runs.

Michigan didn’t slow its 

roll with the middle of the 
order stepping up to the plate. 
Brdar got enough air under a 
fly ball for Thomas to score on 
a sacrifice fly, and Lugbauer 

roped a liner down the right 
field line the following at-bat to 
extend the Wolverines’ lead to 
9-0. The final margin would be 
reached the next inning, with 
two singles and a walk giving 
Michigan insurance that it 
never would be in danger of 

losing.

With the game 

essentially out of 
reach, Michigan 
took 
the 

opportunity 
to 

get an extended 
look 
at 
many 

freshmen 
and 

scarcely-used 
reserves. Junior 
catcher 
Brock 

Keener 
earned 

his first hit as a Wolverine, 
driving 
in 
Bivens 
in 
the 

sixth inning, while redshirt 
freshmen 
infielders 
George 

Hewitt and Joe Pace and 
freshmen 
infielder 
Dominic 

Clementi and outfielder Jack 
Weisenburger 
also 
received 

at-bats.

On the mound, freshman 

right-hander Karl Kauffman, 
the first hurler out of the 
bullpen, was in control, striking 
out four in two innings, while 
redshirt sophomore left-hander 
Grant Reuss and sophomore 
right-hander 
Jack 
Bredeson 

both contributed, tossing one 
scoreless inning each.

“Anytime we can separate 

and have a margin, we want to 
get the guys that train just as 
hard and invest just as much 
time the reward of playing 
time,” 
Bakich 
said. 
“They 

certainly deserve it. When we 
have opportunities to get those 
guys some opportunities to 
play, we’re certainly going to 
do it.”

All 
in 
all, 
Tuesday’s 

performance was an ideal way 
for Michigan to kick off its 
18-game 
homestand, 
which 

will continue on Wednesday 
against Central Michigan, and 
later this week with its Big 
Ten home opener against Penn 
State.

‘M’ stays
unbeaten

The Michigan women’s tennis 

team beat Indiana and Purdue 
this weekend to stay undefeated 
through three Big Ten games this 
season.

Throughout the weekend, the 

Wolverines (3-0 Big Ten, 11-3 
overall) put together a series of 
solid performances in the singles 
which propelled the team to 
victory in both games.

Sophomores Brienne Minor 

and Kate Fahey, along with junior 
Mira Ruder-Hook, led the way for 
Michigan in both the singles and 
doubles play. 

In the Wolverines’ 4-0 victory 

over Indiana (1-3 Big Ten, 10-8 
overall) on Saturday, both Minor 
and Ruder-Hook defeated their 
opponents in straight sets in the 
singles matches.

Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 

Bernstein was pleased with her 
team’s performance outdoors, 
an early look at what an eventual 
postseason appearance would 
feel like.

Despite a relatively easy victory 

against Indiana, Michigan faced a 
much more formidable challenge 
Sunday after Purdue (0-3 Big 
Ten, 5-9 overall) took an early 2-0 
lead after a pair of victories in the 
doubles.

But the singles play would save 

the day for the Wolverines.

Minor, Fahey, Ruder-Hook 

and freshman Chiara Lommer 
handled their opponents in two 
sets, and junior Alex Najarian 
defeated hers in three.

“(Ruder-Hook) is the one 

coming through for us,” Bernstein 
said. “She’s been showing up 
every day.”

Ruder-Hook 
was 
an 
All-

American in the doubles category 
last season, and has demonstrated 
her prowess once again.

Despite 
Michigan’s 
strong 

record, 
Bernstein 
is 
looking 

for 
improvements 
from 
the 

Wolverines moving forward.

“I think we can always get 

better,” Bernstein said. “All the 
kids have something to work on.”

BEHIND THE 

BLOCK ‘M’


F

raming a personal 
struggle around a 
song is tacky. I hate 
when writers do 

that.

But Lorde’s latest release, 

a stirring piano ballad called 
“Liability,” puts into words a 
form of uncertainty I could 
never articulate. The 20-year-
old songstress has peeled back 
her angsty exterior to reveal an 
underlying paradox I know all 
too well: genuine confidence 
coupled with a perpetual 
feeling of loneliness.

Her words spill unevenly 

over 
a 
subdued 
chord 

progression, 
revealing 
her 

confusion in feeling a mixture 
of pride and withdrawal. “So 
I guess I’ll go home / Into the 
arms of the girl that I love / The 
only love I haven’t screwed up,” 
she sings flatly. “She’s so hard 
to please / But she’s a forest 
fire.” Soon enough, listeners 
get the gist: Lorde’s only 
consistent source of affection 
comes from within herself. 
It doesn’t feel tacky anymore 
— “Liability” is the story of 
the unnamed instability that 
plagues the lonely extrovert.

If we’ve ever met, you’re 

probably laughing right now. 
What do I, a boisterous, curly-
haired lump of charisma (that’s 
what you all call me, don’t hide 
it), know about loneliness? 
I’m generally surrounded by 

various groups of wonderful 
people who share my interests, 
and when I’m not, I appear 
to be enjoying my solitude. I 
tweet about self-love, and I get 
plenty of likes on my Instagram 
posts. My outfit is wild, and 
I’m dancing like Carlton Banks 
sans-cardigan, so I must be 
enjoying the empty corner of 
the party, right?

Though this train of logic 

makes enough sense, I’d ask 
you to consider this: How 
would you feel if a Solo cup 
full of chaser (orange pop, and 
nothing but orange pop) was 
the only companion you felt 
entirely comfortable around?

“But what about me, Tess? I 

thought I was your friend.”

There it is, in black and 

white: The worst thing you 
could ever say to a lonely 
extrovert.

Of course we are friends. Of 

course I love you and appreciate 
all that our relationship has 
offered the both of us. I think 
you’re wonderful, and I know 
you think I’m wonderful. But 
feeling lonely has nothing to 
do with whether or not one 
is actually alone. This is an 
internal battle, one that is mine 
to overcome. If you want to 
help, ask me if there’s anything 
you can do — granted, there 
probably isn’t, but I’ll always 
appreciate your concern. If you 
don’t want to help, don’t say a 

thing! All I ask is that you do 
not make my struggle about 
you.

I have no shortage of 

surface-level 
friends, 
but 

what I do lack is a sense of 
emotional security in our 
relationships.

Being strong-willed and 

independent is a beautiful 
thing. It’s what made me 
comfortable traveling to New 
York for my first internship 
at 16, what kept me calm 
when I was denied access 
into an event for which I was 
hired. Yet with my go-getter 
lifestyle comes a caveat few 
have addressed: The fear 
of being seen as a spectacle 
rather than a peer.

Though 
I’m 
happy 
to 

humble-brag about my selfie 
with Gigi Hadid (not sorry) 
or tell someone why I wore 
my green-and-gold trench 
coat to class, I can’t help but 
feel othered by those who ask 
only about the shallow. It’s 
as though actually getting 
to know me is not worth 
their time, but they still 
want all the gossip from my 
time at New York Fashion 
Week. In an atmosphere as 
competitive as the University 
of Michigan’s, I am never 
sure whether people want me 
around for real reasons or if 
they only want to know what 
Kylie Jenner’s lips look like in 

real life (great, by the way).

I’m not trying to complain 

about the support I receive 
from those around me, nor 
do I want to make light of the 
incredible luck I have had in 
securing work opportunities. 
What I do want is to make 
a 
distinction 
between 

praising the glamorous parts 
of someone and actually 
appreciating 
them. 
I’ve 

become so suspicious of the 
first that I rarely recognize 
the latter, even when it’s 
standing right in front of me.

When I do find people who 

want me around for more 
than tabloid-y small talk, I 
doubt everything I do. I’m too 
loud, surely they’ll become 
sick of me soon enough. I 
talk about myself too much 

some days, and ask too many 
questions on others. A piece 
of me is convinced that I’m 
bound to mess up anything 
that brings me fulfillment, 
and so I pull back, for I would 
hate to bother the people I 
care about.

I often feel like those 

I 
interact 
with 
know 

something I don’t, an outsider 
in my own life. I soldier on in 
outspoken solitude because I 
love who I am.

“They’re 
gonna 
watch 

me disappear into the sun,” 
Lorde’s voice quivers at the 
end of “Liability.” “You’re all 
gonna watch me disappear 
into the sun.”

It’s tacky, yes, but if you 

need me, at least you know 
where I’ll be.

Wednesday, March 29, 2017 // The Statement 

BY JACKIE CHARNIGA, DAILY STAFF WRITER
I

t’s a Friday night and my best friend is in 
town, so you know what that means, my 
sympathetic critics: This girl walks into a 
bar.

It was VulfPunk Night at the Blind Pig, and the 

menu featured cover songs of Vulfpeck and Daft 
Punk by four bands, two of which we actually 
sampled.

My first trip to the Blind Pig may also be my 

last: This little piggy is on the market. The 
building was listed by Swisher Commercial 
just last month, and given that its neighbor 
Circus was sold to a New York firm 
earlier this year, the longstanding bars of 
Kerrytown are one by one losing ground.

That’s a shame, because as a venue, the 

Blind Pig is a grungy ’90s time capsule, 
from the neon sign in the smudged windows 
that gives it that seedy tattoo-parlor feel. 
The lack of a coat check is disconcerting 
in the Michigan March weather, but that’s 
OK, the bars on the windows are purely 
decorative — We end up piling our coats by 
the window. “It’s Ann Arbor,” a friend says 
with a shrug. “Who’s gonna take ’em?”

I order a $4 whiskey sour — the weakest 

of my life — before seeing the clever use of 
an iconic poster of Johnny Cash, flipping 
off any patron who tries to pay with a card. 
Shit. They hold my drink behind the bar 
as I trot downstairs to use the ATM and 
see a similar “Cash Only” tee on one of the 
overburdened bartenders. Ah, you got me 
this time, Johnny.

Back upstairs, there’s a guy in a top hat gyrating in 

glow-in-the-dark pants. The dusty mirrors on both 
sides make the room seem bigger, but the sloped 
ceilings and black paint make the upstairs feel like 
a basement. Specifically, your grandmother’s, based 
on the disco ball and wooden fan on the ceiling.

It’s hot in the crowd, so we hit the stairs for 

the visibly less-crowded basement bar, the 8 Ball 
Saloon. A particularly grotesque ’80s jazzercise 
tape plays from a television mounted behind the 
bar as we wait for our drinks, which are whipped 
out with lightning speed. It’s 25 cents cheaper 
down here, for no reason we can think of, and the 
added garnish of lemon feels like a prize.

Speaking of garnish, Christmas lights are a nice 

touch to the man-cave decor. It seems less like a 
saloon and more like your buddy’s game room. I see 

in the corner of my eye, past the rows of booths and 
dart boards, a vending machine, and a South Park 
arcade game.

Walking downstairs, we find photographs along 

the walls that go back decades. I can’t help but 
think everyone in the pictures looks like they’re 
having more fun than I’m having now — or have 
ever had in my entire life for that matter.

No one in the Polaroid history of the Blind Pig 

looks tired, or bored. No one is checking their 
phones, because they’re tethered to cords back in 
their apartments or dorms. The slogan, “When 
was the last time you were Jägermeistered?” is the 
centerpiece of one collection. It certainly has been 
a while, I muse.

Apparently Halloween goes over big at the Pig, 

especially back when people actually dressed to 
scare. In a particularly haunting collection from 
1989, there’s a photo of a girl positively drenched 
in blood that will certainly be featured in my 
nightmares.

We don’t realize at the time, but the first band, 

the Paddlebots, will be our favorite, mostly because 
the trombone player looks like my roommate’s 
boyfriend. I’m on my third sour, feeling nothing, 
and am glad I didn’t try to order anything with 
more than two ingredients. There’s free popcorn 

here, another comparison to Circus two doors 
down. “It’s so people don’t vomit,” my roommate 
says, popping some into her mouth. “The popcorn 
sucks up the booze.”

The club, known for hosting an early Nirvana 

gig, has also seen performances by R.E.M., Sonic 
Youth and Soundgarden. The funk-music lineup 
playing tonight, however, is why I think I’m about 
two decades too late to enjoy the Blind Pig. The 

musicians are clearly talented, but I feel 
trapped in my disdain as the current of 
those seriously feeling themselves surges 
around me. What’s playing is basically 
what you’d hear at any co-op party, but 
at least I don’t pay $8 for that privilege. I 
stand in Debbie Downer protest, sipping 
my drink as the audience rocks like a sea 
of Bobo dolls with big smiles plastered on 
their faces.

The pseudo-funk blares as the stage 

lights cut through the crowd, burning 
my corneas, to justify the sunglasses 
worn by every member of the band trying 
desperately to live up to their name, Act 
Casual. All that was missing from this 
generic college-party scene was a beach 
ball, lazily kept aloft by the beanie-clad 
and bespeckled crowd.

Though it’s eons away from my taste, 

the music certainly has people dancing. 
The tempo is fast and urgent, the crowd 
writhes beneath the seizure-inducing 
lights. Abruptly, it slows, and my friend 

says it’s like coming down from a high.

“It’s like coming down from a high,” a voice 

echoes behind me. Two guys are reading over my 
shoulder, clearly not absorbed by the performance 
in front of us. That’s what I get for taking notes on 
my phone.

Heralding the Floridian restaurant music is 

the lead singer, who besides interjecting with an 
occasional catch phrase hasn’t done much with his 
microphone. “Let’s get funky,” he sings, about as 
funky as string cheese.

A metronome beat holds down the fort during the 

third and final sound-check until we hear the bong 
of a clock strike. Drumsticks count down the start 
of yet more funk-a-licious tunes, now accompanied 
by auto-tuned vocals, but we’ve had enough. We 
turn to leave, using the cold night to sooth our 
aching heads.

Behind the Block ‘M’

the buisness of branding the University

b y T i m C o h n, Daily News Editor

For more than a century, the University of Michi-

gan’s logo — the block ‘M’ — has been an Ann Arbor 

staple, emblazoned on everything from the Big 

House scoreboard to the graduation-party cakes of 

high-school seniors.

Despite slight modifications over the years, the 

simple, maize-colored ‘M’ set on a blue field has 

symbolized the University’s historically dominant 

Athletic Department for more than 100 years. And 

in recent years, the famous ‘M’ has been branded to 

represent the entire institution.

The block ‘M’ dates back to the late 1800s, but not 

until 1907 did it become a fixture at major athletic 

events. In 1907, students attending a football game at 

Ferry Field — the predecessor to Michigan Stadium 

— first raised maize and blue flags to form the now-

iconic logo.

Brian Williams, the lead bicentennial archivist at 

the Bentley Historical Library, added that the Uni-

versity’s athletic teams also unofficially adopted the 

block ‘M’ in the 1900s.

“There were a number of versions of the ‘M’ used 

by early football and baseball teams,” Williams said. 

He explained that modern versions of the logo were 

used by the University’s football team in about 1900. 

Baseball teams, however, used variations of the ‘M’ 

— such as Old English or Gothic style — on uniforms, 

caps and warm-up coats into the 1910s.

In the decades that followed, the block ‘M’ was 

fully embraced by the University, and the commer-

cialization of the logo followed. A 1975 Sports Illus-

trated feature by Frank Deford about Don Canham, 

the University’s former athletic director, described 

this level of brand management as unprecedented in 

the world of college sports.

“We’ve (the University Athletic Department) got 

to promote what we have,” Canham said in 1975. 

“We’ve got to ballyhoo the pageantry, the weekend 

on the campus, the kids, the cheerleaders, the bands. 

And the same thing with basketball. We’ve got to sell 

the spectacle.”

The Sports Illustrated feature painstakingly 

details the extent to which Canham had commer-

cialized the school’s brand, which was modest by 

the modern standards of NCAA merchandising, but 

extraordinary in 1975.

“Canham’s brochures have been compared … to 

Florida land-development brochures,” Deford wrote. 

“The Michigan mailing goes to 1.2 million homes … 

(peddling) through mail orders all manner of Wol-

verine bric-a-brac: doormats, playing cards, books, 

ashtrays, lamps shaped like football helmets and 

pocketbooks shaped like footballs and basketballs.”

During Canham’s 20-year tenure from 1968 to 

1988, the University’s athletic brand grew in popu-

larity. The football program underwent a renais-

sance led by head coach Glenn “Bo” Schembechler, 

who coached the team from 1969 to 1989 and would 

become the winningest football coach in University 

history. The basketball team simultaneously enjoyed 

a sustained period of success under head coach John-

ny Orr, who coached the team from 1968 to 1980, 

going all the way to the national championship game 

in 1976.

But since the 1960s, the block ‘M’ has undergone 

rebranding to represent the University’s academic 

institutions in addition to its athletic powerhouse — 

supplanting its less famous cousin, the academic seal 

of the University, which is now reserved solely for 

official purposes involving the University’s elected 

Board of Regents.

Consequently, this growth in brand awareness 

translated to big business for the University that 

brings in millions of dollars in licensing fees each 

year. 

The University realized the commercial potential 

of its brand before many other public universities, 

according to Steve Busch, the University’s brand 

manager.

“The University of Michigan was one of the first 

universities to recognize the value of its mark from 

a fan-affinity perspective, and then trademark that 

and utilize it to generate revenue for its athletic pro-

grams,” Busch said. “And that is how that mark (the 

block ‘M’) is used. It goes to fund the Athletic Depart-

ment and their campus as well as fund 930-plus stu-

dent athletes that utilize the athletic campus.”

But the issue of the University’s brand extends 

beyond business interests, encompassing the ques-

tion of the University’s dual identity as a public uni-

versity and multi-million-dollar business enterprise.

******

LSA junior Jack Googasian is the president of the 

Michigan Ultras, the soccer fan section equivalent of 

the University’s Maize Rage or Children of Yost. In 

2016, his organization attempted to gain permission 

from the University to use the block ‘M’ as a part of its 

logo. However, because Michigan Ultras is a volun-

tary student organization — a student organization 

that receives no funding from the University — the 

request was denied.

According to the University’s guidelines for logo 

usage by student groups, only sponsored student 

organizations — ones that are supervised by an exec-

utive officer, dean or University director — can gain 

access to the coveted block ‘M.’

But even sponsored student organizations must 

adhere to strict logo-usage rules that are considered 

by some to be archaic. For instance, they’re prohib-

ited from using the block ‘M’ as part of their own 

logos. Instead, they can use it on promotional materi-

als such as flyers and posters.

To Googasian, these regulations are understand-

able, even if they are cumbersome.

“While inconvenient, I totally recognize the Uni-

versity’s restraint from allowing every student orga-

nization to use these trademarks,” Googasian said. 

“We have every intention of following the guidelines 

… so we do not cause any problems for the adminis-

tration. Ultimately they are not trying to be critical or 

unsupportive of student groups but defensive of their 

own trademarks and who uses them.”

In 2013, the University standardized the design of 

the block ‘M’ to ensure consistency in its display.

A style-and-usage guide released by the Univer-

sity dictates strict provisions on the sizing, color, 

aspect ratios and fonts that are allowed when dis-

playing the block ‘M.’ 

“From a design perspective, it’s clean, classic, and 

understated,” the website reads. “Yet the new sig-

nature mark is a quick communicator of our nearly 

200-year heritage, communicating authority and 

tradition. In its simplicity, there’s authority. In its 

understatement, a refusal to bow to passing design 

fads. Which earns it one additional adjective: excep-

tional.”

At the time, then-University President Mary Sue 

Coleman issued a statement articulating that the 

decision to embrace the block ‘M’ was made largely 

because of the logo’s instant recognizability.

“As we embrace a new look for the University’s 

graphic identity — building on the globally recog-

nized Block M — we are carrying Michigan for-

ward,” Coleman wrote in 2013. “Adopting this 

common identity reinforces the academic excellence 

that is synonymous with the University of Michigan. 

It pays tribute to our collective heritage, allows us to 

speak in one voice, and helps us move into our third 

century as one of the world’s greatest universities.”

From these messages, it is clear the University 

seeks to brand itself as a globally prestigious and 

forward-thinking institution that is rooted in his-

tory, with the famous ‘M’ as a standard-bearer of 

that image. But in this massive branding effort, does 

the University also compromise its values as a public 

institution meant to serve the nearly 10 million citi-

zens of Michigan?

Busch — the official tasked with handling con-

cerns related to the non-commercial use of the block 

‘M’ logo — thinks not. According to him, the Univer-

sity has resisted adopting a corporate-style approach 

to the licensing of its brand, even after years of 

increasing brand recognition.

“We think it is important to handle all requests 

to use the University’s logo on a case-by-case basis 

because we are not a corporation, we are a public 

institution of higher learning,” Busch said. “We have 

over 550,000 living alumni, and many of them are 

very proud to be affiliated with the University, and 

we want them to be able to demonstrate their affinity 

for symbols associated with the University.”

Busch’s office receives hundreds of requests 

annually for the use of the block ‘M,’ primarily for 

small-scale commercial purposes. This includes 

people requesting permission to place the block ‘M’ 

on customizable celebratory graduation cakes to 

requests by local high schools to use similarly styled 

logos and uniform designs for athletic teams.

Typically, Busch says, this poses no problem to the 

University so long as it meets two major criteria: Is 

the purpose for the logo’s use for sentimental reasons 

instead of commercial purposes, and does the use of 

the logo harm the University?

If the intent of its use is to enrich oneself or a given 

business, which is often the case, then the request 

must go through the licensing office where business 

arrangements must be made before the University 

will lend its image to a product. Additionally, when 

assessing if the use of the logo could potentially harm 

the University’s brand, Busch says his office looks for 

a particular set of red flags.

“If a company or a person wants to use the Uni-

versity’s logo for business purposes, they would have 

to go through our licensing and trademarks depart-

ment where they would be instructed to obtain 

a CLC (Collegiate Licensing Company) license — 

which is our partner that manages the licensing of 

our block ‘M.’ ” Busch said. “But then they would also 

have to get approval from the University where they 

would outline what that item is. And we stay away 

from things that we would call the ‘sin items’: We 

don’t do anything affiliated with items like alcohol, 

tobacco, drugs or pornography.”

Beth Paul, the University’s director of strate-

gic partnerships at the Trademarks and Licens-

ing Program, which is housed within the Athletic 

Department, helps oversee and manage many of the 

contracts the CLC makes with prospective busi-

ness partners seeking to use the University’s logo. 

According to her, there are a wide variety of compa-

nies, large and small, that are authorized to use the 

block ‘M.’

“Our licensing team manages the use of our marks 

and logos on merchandise, and has been navigating 

this environment for many, many years,” Paul said. 

“Michigan currently has approximately 400 compa-

nies who are licensed to produce items bearing the 

University name and/or trademarks.”

The process to gain University permission to use 

the block ‘M’ logo — despite being processed mainly 

through the CLC — must meet certain requirements 

as a part of a business litmus test, Paul noted.

“There are many criteria we use to evaluate 

whether a company would make a good licensing 

partner, including business history of (the) company; 

whether they have any experience in sports licens-

ing; whether they have strong retailer relationships 

already established; whether we need additional 

companies in a particular product category or dis-

tribution channel; quality or product and application 

of logos; compliance history; and corporate social 

responsibility program are just some of the hard fac-

tors that we consider,” Paul said.

*****

The use of the block ‘M’ logo for private business 

is something that has been a source of significant 

funds for the University in recent decades. The Uni-

versity’s royalties from licensed merchandise bear-

ing the block ‘M’ amounted to $6 million between 

June 2011 and July 2012, according to an Associated 

Press report published by the Oakland Press News 

in January 2013.

This, the article claims, is indicative of a grow-

ing culture of collegiate licensing — during each of 

those years the University handled just more than 

80 licensing requests, granting access to more than 

70 percent of applicants.

“Collegiate licensing is a $4.6 billion enterprise 

and the University of Michigan generated the fifth-

highest licensing earnings of any university in 

fiscal 2012, according to Collegiate Licensing Com-

pany rankings,” the article reads. “The University 

of Michigan’s licensing revenue climbed 22 percent 

in fiscal 2012, rising $1.1 million from the previous 

year’s revenue of $4.9 million.”

While many of the license holders do not yield 

significant revenue for the institution, others can net 

the University hundreds of millions.

In April 2016, the University finalized a splashy 

apparel deal with Nike, and the financial details of 

this business agreement are staggering.

Nike agreed to pay the University a guaranteed 

sum of at least $173.8 million in exchange for the 

contracts with the University Athletic Department, 

and the rights to merchandise apparel to the general 

public through at least 2027 with an option to extend 

the contract through 2031. 

This mega-deal put the University in elite compa-

ny. According to ESPN, the University’s deal, which 

was believed to be the largest collegiate-apparel 

deal ever at the time it was signed, has only recently 

been surpassed by the University of California at Los 

Angeles, the University of Texas and Ohio State Uni-

veristy.

Given the financial stakes, the University seeks 

to maintain tight control over its brand image. And, 

thus far, the University has done so scrupulously.

The University’s logo — like almost those of every 

other university — annually maintains its trademark 

and federal registration, according to Busch.

“The modern iteration of the block ‘M’ … is fed-

erally registered and trademarked by the Athletic 

Department on an annual basis,” Busch said. “And 

they ensure that the trademark is protected by work-

ing with the counsel’s office. The University will 

pursue people or companies that try to use the logo 

without our permission.”

******

The University’s protectiveness of its brand is not 

new. Nor is it uncommon among U.S. universities, 

especially those with such large athletic depart-

ments and alumni bases. So why does it matter?

Simply put, because the block ‘M’ logo carries 

a significant meaning. And if we are to believe the 

opinions of Canham, Coleman and Busch, it is one 

that is emblematic of athletic dominance and aca-

demic prestige.

When dealing with business interests that tally 

earnings in the millions, it seems reasonable the 

institution would like to keep tight control and pro-

tect its brand from third parties misusing and abus-

ing its reputation.

For students like Googasian and his soccer club, 

this means that the block ‘M’ is not available. Accord-

ing to Busch, it is not that the University wants to 

exclude organizations like the Michigan Ultras from 

using the block ‘M,’ but rather this prohibition on 

voluntary student organizations’ use of the logo is 

meant to serve as a precedent to insulate the Uni-

versity from being caught between a rock and a hard 

place.

Because of decades of calculated processes to 

build its brand’s credibility, the block ‘M’ lends legiti-

macy to whatever object to which it is attached.

If all student clubs, regardless of their Univer-

sity sponsorship status, had unfettered access to the 

block ‘M,’ then the University would have little to no 

control over what the public perceived as University-

sponsored.

Not only would this pose problems for the Univer-

sity if the block ‘M’ were used in the logo of a political 

organization, but, if taken to its logical end, the Uni-

versity could potentially have difficulty controlling 

their logos usage by organizations that violate the 

“sin items.”

“Volunteer organizations do not have access to 

the block ‘M’ as a measure to protect itself,” Busch 

said. “It’s one of those things where if someone set 

up a drinking club or a beer-pong club and they used 

the block ‘M’ and something dubious or unfortunate 

happened where some student’s safety was endan-

gered, we would want it to be clear that those activi-

ties were not sanctioned by the University.”

*****

The block ‘M’ presents other questions about the 

nature of the institution. Given the symbol’s his-

tory as a mark of the University’s athletic tradition, 

is the University’s formal adoption of the logo for the 

entirety of the institution implicitly a sign that the 

University wants to promote its athletic brand before 

its academic one?

Furthermore, considering the significant 

revenue generated by the Athletic Department 

because of the efforts of more than 930 stu-

dent-athletes, are the University’s profits justly 

earned?

The University administration has offered 

answers to both these questions through the 

years. Coleman, when announcing the block ‘M’s 

adoption, spoke only of the implications of unify-

ing the academic institution under the logo. And 

critics of the NCAA prohibition on paying players 

under the guise of amateurism cannot reasonably 

blame the University for adhering to the rules of 

collegiate sports’ governing body.

Such questions go to a larger debate about 

the identity of the University. As the institution 

enters its third century, and is in the throes of a 

year-long bicentennial celebration of its past and 

present, the University has been calling upon its 

extensive network of affiliates to consider the 

future. What will the University stand for going 

forward? What values and causes will the Uni-

versity champion?

As for Busch, who is both a graduate and cur-

rent employee of the University, the protection 

of the block ‘M’ and the image of the University 

ensures the longevity of the institution’s good 

reputation while also keeping the logo available 

to all who bleed blue.

“I have a great degree of pride and esteem 

for the brand,” Busch said. “My approach to the 

identity of the University is first and foremost to 

ensure the preservation of the brand and I take a 

great degree of pride in that and our fair and rea-

sonable approach. We are a brand that has a high 

affinity for more than just athletic achievements, 

and we want to celebrate that.”

Personal Statement: 
The Politics of Art-Making

Editor’s note: Amy Chavasse is a professor 

in dance in the University of Michigan’s School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance. Her teaching inter-
ests include contemporary dance technique, 
improvisation, composition and social issues 
on dance. She is also the artistic director of 
ChavasseDance&Performance.
R

estlessness and curiosity have 
always been incentives for my 
practice as a dance maker, per-
former, improviser and educator. 

It’s looking like it’s high time to let righteous 
indignation find its way back into my choreo-
graphic considerations.

Finding methods to survive the next four 

years as an artist, humanist, environmentally 
aware citizen, a student of science, a supporter 
of Meals on Wheels and a believer in the bene-
fits of diversity will resound in the ways I craft 
my next dances and move through the world.

I’ve been donating to the Southern Poverty 

Law Center — a nonprofit organization for civ-
il-rights legal advocacy — for years. I recently 
finished reading the biography of its founder, 
Morris Dees, and I’ve joined, like many oth-
ers, the American Civil Liberties Union. I’ve 
increased my donations to Planned Parent-
hood to reinforce myself and construct a buf-
fer against the mendacity and absurdity that is 
part of the noise of the day.

Writing about the Brussels-based choreog-

rapher Meg Stuart, dancer David Hernandez 
comments: “Drawing the eye of the public 
to what is important is an investigation that 
relates to the way we are reading people’s bod-
ies every day of our life. How someone enters 
the room or is holding herself — the animal 
part in us sizes up a situation intuitively, like 
a plug directly into the brain.” Cultivating 
“sizing-up” skills feels crucial now. My cho-
reographic research survived Donald Rums-
feld — one of the first dances I performed 
here at the University of Michigan was a work 
inspired by Rumsfeld’s tortured rhetoric and 
reasoning. It was called “Not Mistaken” and 
involved a large vat of pudding and lots of his-
trionics.

Although I dance to toss little nuggets of 

self-satisfaction to my ego, to feel a combus-
tible blend of physical and intellectual exer-
tion, I more intensely dance to imagine other 
realities, to slip into the skin of other people or 
creatures.

My experiences broaden as I age, as does 

my willingness to expose the urgency of my 
intentions. Consequently, my encounters with 
imagined ways of being in the world expand 
and surprise, heightening the tension between 
illusion, desire and subterfuge. Age gives the 
gift of loosening attachments to inhibitions 

and vanity. I wish I had known this sooner. My 
heroines and mentors are women who became 
more experimental and radical in their art-
making and as they grew older, rather than 
tacking toward the reliable dullness that 
comes with settling into the familiar, conser-
vative and acceptable.

I make dances to wrestle with raging ques-

tions, to deal with the discursive clutter and 
noise that fill my thoughts. When asked what 
her dancers are about, famed contemporary 
choreographer Pina Bausch answers: “How 
people behave in their desire … and what 
moves people, not how they move.”

I also keep in mind this question: Does my 

art serve a purpose beyond fulfilling me or 
advancing my career? After the election of 
Donald Trump, I’ve been looking at how — or 
if — it’s possible to make political dances that 
matter or invite change. There is so much noise 
and disruption inside my head and a feeling of 
being under attack — it is a familiar feeling.

During the eight years of the George W. 

Bush administration, I threw myself whole-
heartedly into making dances with “state-
ments,” with overt points of view, with 
embedded challenges to the status quo and 
to counter the damaging rhetoric and actions, 
the consequences from which we are still suf-
fering from.

“81 Questions” was the first politically 

driven dance I made. I latched on to the 
number of questions submitted to the House 
Judiciary Committee in the lead-up to for-
mer-President Bill Clinton’s impeachment 
hearings in 1989. It was an examination of 
hypocrisy and grandstanding. I recall the 
reviewer of my dance describing it as ellipti-
cal and containing several absurdly graphic 
situations. I don’t think it was very well 
constructed, but it was an itch I needed to 
scratch.

I began my autodidactic education around 

how to make work that has integrity, shape, 
momentum and interest outside of the politi-
cal motivation that launched it. The movement 
and the movers still had to be translucent with 
intent, sharp with alertness and full of pres-
ence. I’m still deep inside this education. It 
became interested in tracking hesitation, 
infallibility and failure, alongside smug self-
righteousness. Showing multiple angles, con-
fusing the point of view became an interesting 
challenge to me. I guess what I’m saying is that 
I veered more toward parody.

“I Sleep with Ann Coulter” takes a scathing 

look at hypocrisy and the flagrant act of public 
lying as a handsomely profitable career choice 
— themes that are front and center again. I 
made and premiered this solo in 2007, after 

enduring one of Ann Coulter’s many cyni-
cal tirades. In this one she railed against the 
“fags” and “miscreants on the liberal left” who 
were polluting society. Constructing a move-
ment narrative, a kind of cheeky personal 
declaration, I told the story of being Coulter’s 
secret lover, patiently waiting for her to return 
home to me each night.

If the audience sees my work and asks, 

“What is going on and why?” I find this a valu-
able response. I think we should be asking this 
question more often, and with more urgency, 
about art and the events unfolding around us. 
Viewing a dance, or experiencing any work of 
art, is not a passive activity. Questions should 
arise constantly. Answers either align with the 
various questions or do not. The idea of liking 
something or not liking something shouldn’t 
privilege the sensation of expectancy, disori-
entation or repositioning that can occur when 
we encounter something new, or something 
old presented in a new way.

“Hunger for the Longing (a biased history of 

seduction)” seeks ways of exposing the misin-
terpreted folk mythology surrounding Woody 
Guthrie’s “This Land is Your Land” through 
movement, theater, video and music. As “God 
Bless America,” with its themes of overt patri-
otism saturated the public conscience, Guth-
rie created this iconic work to counter what 
he viewed as misleading representations of 
nationalism and common good. Examining 
and (de)reconstructing ideas about seduction 
and indoctrination, I used multiple versions of 
Guthrie’s anthem to the common man, honing 
in on the latter and less well known verses.

“All I Ask of My Enemies” is a duet with 

video that examines the concept of enemies 

— how we decide who our enemy is, how 
we treat those identified as the enemy, the 
opportunistic nature of naming one’s ene-
mies, the use of force and coercion once the 
enemy is captured, and how human nature 
is subverted when one person claims power 
and superiority over another. It grew out 
of my research on the torture and abuse at 
the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad in 2004. 
I found and then scoured documents from 
the National Security Archives, in particu-
lar a policy paper titled “Prohibition on the 
Use of Force.” It contained the most beauti-
ful language that described the most dis-
turbing acts, which I adapted for the work. I 
augmented the contents of the archives with 
my own words and songs. A video, created 
by video artist Sue Rees, supports the absur-
dity of the exchange with excerpts from the 
Roadrunner — Wile E. Coyote cartoons, 
intercut with James Bond movie footage.

In reminding myself that making art 

should feel driven by more than tactics of 
survival, I’m reclaiming my embrace of the 
unique ways that movement expresses desire 
and can expose or imagine an alternative 
reality. “Emi, Amy and Mimi, the Celebrated 
Love Partners, and their Bicycle Emi Nomo,” 
is a new trio collaboration that recently pre-
miered in New York.

It imagines a world in which three charac-

ters are bound together in a shared memory 
of something lost. The characters sing about 
orgasms and bicycles and imaginary adven-
tures. While continuing to refine this new 
work, I’m looking ahead to tackling a thorny 
topic, to dealing with my righteous indigna-
tion.

Personal Statement: A Meditation on Polar Bears

E

very summer growing up, my entire 
extended family went to a tiny sum-
mer camp on a tiny lake in south-

western Michigan for one week. Normally, 
swaths of children from grade school to high 
school occupied the campgrounds, but we went 
for what’s called “Family Furlough,” the period 
when only families were allowed. Each summer 
I’d anticipate that second week in July when I 
could spend my days adventuring with cousins 
— catching toads on wooded paths, floating in 
canoes to catch map turtles in the marshes and 
diving off the floating dock at the deepest part 
of the lake.

But there were always limits to my adventur-

ous zeal. There were always those adventures 
that were ultimate, rising above the others in 
daringness required and prestige acquired after 
conquering them. For me, this ultimate adven-
ture was jumping in the lake with the group of 
campers and counselors who went each morn-
ing before breakfast.

Each night at dinner, one of the roving young 

staffers would remind us enthusiastically that 
“polar bears” — the lake jumpers — would meet 
on the beach at 6:30 a.m. This band of brazen 
souls amazed me. Not only would they wake 
up at 6:30 — they would wake up to jump in the 
freezing morning water. Sure, it was July, but 
the sun still made a difference for the Midwest-
ern freshwater.

What the polar bears did always seemed so 

unreachable. I couldn’t fathom how they willed 
themselves out of bed and mustered the har-
diness to expose their bodies to the elements 
like that. I so badly wanted to be one of those 
brave ones, but none of my cousins ever went 
in the morning, and I was too shy to go alone. 
I imagined the freshening rush they must’ve 
felt, emerging from the water and wrapping up 
in a towel, warming in the quiet camaraderie of 
experiences shared in the early hours.

Though my family still goes to camp every 

year, I’ve yet to become a polar bear — by the 
time I’d grown confident enough to go, I figured 
I was too old. I had resigned to the fact that polar 
bears would just never be my adventure the way 
toad-catching, turtle-catching and dock-diving 
had been. Even so, I still feel the pang of longing 
when the 6:30 a.m. wake-up call is announced 
at dinner.

Not unreasonably, I kind of thought that 

would be it — that my chances to jump in a lake 
surrounded by woods with a group of people 
in the summer were pretty much over. Last 
summer, however, I found myself in a situation 
similar to camp in many ways, while partaking 
in the University of Michigan’s New England 
Literature Program, where students take col-
lege courses in the unconventional setting of 
the New Hampshire wilderness.

The program was housed at a summer camp 

whose grounds were sprinkled with cabins cen-
tered around a big dining hall, not unlike the one 
we dined in during Family Furlough. The other 

students and I were there for six weeks from 
early spring to early summer, which means it 
was still pretty cold. Despite this, the lake that 
bordered the grounds seemed to dare me to 
swim in it. This could be my second chance.

At our first dinner all together in the spa-

cious, high-ceilinged dining hall, one of the 
younger instructors, Everett, announced he’d 
be jumping in the lake at 7:30 every morning, 
and that anyone was welcome to meet him on 
the steps of the dining hall to come with. It 
wasn’t 6:30, but the significantly colder water 
made the idea of jumping in just as ultimate, just 
as untouchable.

I turned to face my new friend, Liam, and 

he pre-empted my question by stating imme-
diately that he’d be on those front steps bright 
and early. Since his bed was next to mine in our 
cabin, I told him he should wake me up when he 
went and to make me come with him. I knew it 
wouldn’t be easy.

That night after dinner we did our reading by 

lamplight and went to bed plenty early so we’d 
have enough for the task that would be before 
us come morning.

I woke up to Liam tapping me on the shoul-

der, standing over my bed wearing the clothes 
he had on the night before — it was so cold 
inside our unheated, fireplace-less cabin that 
it wasn’t even worth changing before going to 
sleep. I whispered a groggy “good morning” 
and looked above my head at the spring light 
leaking through the cracks in the shutters of the 
window, shining through the cabin door. With 
a quick stretch I peeled myself out of my sleep-
ing bag, letting the 40-degree air welcome me 
to the waking hours. I told Liam I’d meet him 
there, grabbed my swimsuit and towel, then 
rushed to the bathroom to change, knowing if I 
didn’t exit the cabin soon, I’d fall back into bed.

I tumbled half-awake out of the cabin into 

the day-lit woods, hearing the echoes of wood-
peckers in the distance and the songs of milder 
birds nearby. After changing, I ambled over 
woodchip paths to the front steps of the dining 
hall, where Everett and Liam sat exchanging 
what few words they could in this cold morn-
ing hour.

We went to the front steps of the dining hall 

to meet Everett, then the three of us went down 
to the dock.

Standing on the wooden planks we stared 

out at the water as yet undisturbed by boats or 
swimming bodies, then looked at one another 
solemnly, accepting our inevitable fate. It was 
time. Flinging off our shoes and extra layers, 
our breath made steam clouds as we jogged in 
place to work up the adrenaline for the jump.

“Ready?” Everett said. Liam and I nodded 

very seriously. “One. Two. Three.” A blood-
curdling scream emerged from my lungs and 
echoed through the morning air for a split sec-
ond before I was totally submerged. All at once, 
the cold rush enveloped me, the lake welcom-
ing me to its silent depths. As soon as my body 

caught its bearings, I pushed myself upward, 
and right when my head escaped the freezing 
quiet of underwater, Liam and Everett’s shouts 
of nonsense profanities echoed through the dry 
air. Soon I joined in as we all lunged toward the 
ladder to get back onto the dock.

We did this every morning, and it wasn’t 

long before our friend Caroline joined and we 
became the four most consistent jumpers. We 
started this tradition with Everett and Liam 
singing the “Rocky” theme song while Caroline 
and I pretended to hum along, all four of us jog-
ging in a circle, doing random arm motions to 
get pumped up before the plunge. There were 
mornings over those six weeks that I didn’t 
want to go — I was too tired, I didn’t want to be 
cold, or I had too much reading to do. I did skip 
some mornings, but never without regret.

I wasn’t quite sure why I was doing this 

thing. I didn’t care about polar bears that much, 
but jumping in the lake each morning felt signif-
icant. My great friend who led me to this litera-
ture program in the woods also loved jumping 
in water at daybreak, something she told me 
before I left for this place. Although polar bears 
and my friend’s account had to have influenced 
my thinking, I don’t think these are the real rea-
sons I kept jumping in.

Thoreau, whose work we read as part of the 

program, jumped in water too. In “Walden,” he 
writes:

“Every morning was a cheerful invitation 

to make my life of equal simplicity, and I may 
say innocence, with Nature herself. … I got 
up early and bathed in the pond; that was a 

religious exercise, and one of the best things 
which I did. … Renew thyself completely 
each day; do it again, and again, and forever 
again.” 

Maybe that was it — I relished in the daily 

renewal. Now, at school, my heart aches for 
that invigoration. When I wake up, I roll 
out of bed, clothe myself and stride onto the 
sidewalk only to sit in a library or classroom 
for hours, bent — albeit happily — over a 
book or my keyboard, reading and writing 
away. I miss the severe, utter, intense sensa-
tion with which I began each morning in the 
lake, making myself breathless in despera-
tion to get out of the cold, cold water.

This summer I’ll be settled in the land-

locked metropolis of Columbus, Ohio, unfor-
tunately a car ride away from any large 
bodies of water. But before I settle into the 
rhythm of summer jobs, my family has a trip 
planned for my grandparents’ anniversary. 
We’ll be staying in a house on a lake in Mary-
land, and I think the water will be pretty 
cold. I’m looking forward to jumping in each 
morning, and it’s likely only my grandma 
will be awake with me. I know I’ll miss Liam 
and Everett and Caroline, but I wonder if 
these solo jumps might be a little more like 
Thoreau’s when he lived in solitude those 
couple of months in the woods. Either way, 
the simple touch of water and the struggle 
of emerging anew, back onto the land again, 
will be enough for me.

On March 14, I photographed The Flaming Lips at the Royal 

Oak Music Theatre. Their performance was an incredible 
experience of sound and color. Music filled the theatre for 
over two hours, opening with the energetic “Race for the 

Prize” and ending with the heartfelt “Do You Realize??” After 

two encores, the Flaming Lips played a beautiful concert I 

would highly recommend to anyone.
