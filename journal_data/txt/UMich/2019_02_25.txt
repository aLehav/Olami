Ann 
Arbor 
residents 
and 
University of Michigan students 
gathered Friday Night in the 
tea room of Crazy Wisdom 
Bookstore to discuss ways to 
protest conservative author and 
commentator Ben Shapiro’s visit 
to campus, which is scheduled to 
occur on March 12.
Those gathered at the meeting 
went over a powerpoint on 
strategies for the protest and 
who Ben Shapiro is, followed by 
a brainstorm session. Ann Arbor 
activist Adam Nash, who helped 
organize the meeting, stated the 
goal was to simply create a solution 
as a group to respond to Shapiro’s 
event.
“We’re 
here 
because 
Ben 

Shapiro was invited to campus to 
speak on March 12,” Nash said. 
“We just want to talk about what 
our community response should 
be to this.”
Nash 
broke 
down 
their 
approach 
through 
St. 
Paul’s 
Principles. The principles include 
solidarity 
based 
on 
respect, 
organization of tactics to maintain 
a separation of time and space, 
avoiding 
public 
denunciations 
of other activist groups and not 
engaging in any violent actions.
Nash then shared information 
he had gathered about who 
Shapiro is and how he conveys his 
message to the masses. 

LSA freshman Hiba Dagher 
arrived at the University of 
Michigan this past fall hoping to 
find a close-knit Arab community 
similar to the one she had at home 
in Dearborn. But initially, Dagher 
didn’t see this community on 
campus. She recalled how she 
didn’t meet people in her classes 
who shared her culture.
“When I was applying to 
Michigan, everyone always told 
me that this was a very diverse 
campus and you’ll see a lot of 
people of color, a lot of people 
who look like you or understand 
where you’re coming from,” 
Dagher said. “I was going to 
my first classes and my first 
discussions and I wasn’t really 
seeing that, and I found people 

treating me different … I didn’t 
expect it at college and I didn’t 
expect it at Michigan.”
Dagher learned about the Arab 
Student 
Association 
through 
a group chat she created with 
members of her Dearborn Arab 
community. 
After 
attending 
events and meeting people with 
similar backgrounds to her own, 
Dagher became more involved in 
the Arabesque Dance Troupe and 
ASA. This past Saturday, Dagher 
took part in Arab Xpressions, a 
celebration of Arab heritage.
Xpressions 
is 
an 
annual 
performance 
partnered 
with 
Arabesque 
and 
ASA 
that 
showcases Arab culture through 
aspects such as music, poetry, 
dance and song. The theme of 
year’s performance was “Ajyal,” 
Arabic for “generations.”
Dagher found herself involved 

with many different parts of 
Xpressions this year. She had a 
role in a video for the freshman 
skit and danced in the all-girls 
Raqs Al-Banat Dabke. Dagher 
also recited an original poem for 
the spoken words portion of the 
show and walked in the fashion 
show at the conclusion of the 
show.
“You see Xpressions and you 
see, ‘Oh, this is a way that my 
culture’s never been portrayed 
to me before,’” Dagher said. 
“It’s Arabs who are holding the 
narrative in their hands and 
they’re forging it in whatever way 
they want to.”
Beginning 
over 
a 
decade 
ago and originally performed 
in 
the 
Michigan 
Union, 
Xpressions moved into the Lydia 
Mendelssohn Theatre in 2017. 
The production moved again 

to the Power Center last year, 
a theater with 1,300-person 
capacity. The show came close to 
selling out in 2018 and completely 
sold out this year, according to 
Xpressions 
Director 
Nicolas 
Nunu, an Engineering junior.
Nunu 
became 
involved 
with 
Xpressions 
during 
his 
freshman year and directed this 
year’s performance. The show 
involved about 130 people and 
preparations began in October. 
He said the implemented theme, 
generations, demonstrates the 
changing Arab identity over time 
and works to navigate the idea 
of what it means to be an Arab 
American on campus.

Citizens’ Climate Lobby, the 
University’s chapter of College 
Republicans and the Climate Action 
Movement at the University of 
Michigan hosted the Non-Partisan 
Climate Solutions Forum Friday in 
the Samuel T. Dana Building. The 
forum fostered discussion on the 
Energy Innovation and Carbon 
Dividend Act of 2019.
Tim Dalrymple, LSA sophomore 
and treasurer of Citizens Climate 
Lobby, 
began 
the 
event 
by 
describing and explaining each 
aspect of the bill including the 
fee, the return and the border tax 
adjustment. The first aspect of the 
bill places a fee on the extraction of 
oil at the site.
“The fee is supposed to factor 
in the environmental cost that our 
economic system doesn’t factor 
in to carbon emissions’ effect on 
climate change,” Dalrymple said. 
“What it does is it incentivizes 
energy companies to produce less 
fossil fuels and extract less fossil 
fuels, given that a lot of current U.S. 
energy companies have renewable 
energy divisions.

Presentations center around theme ‘absolute zero,’ discuss challenging assumptions

Over 1000 people gathered at the 
Power Center on Friday evening 
for 
the 
sold-out 
tenth 
annual 
TedxUofM 
conference 
Absolute 
Zero. Eight University of Michigan 
faculty, alumni and students spoke 
at the event, reflecting on their 

personal experiences to share on 
what “absolute zero” meant to them. 
The event was also live streamed on 
TEDxUofM’s website.
Clara Munkarah, LSA junior and 
co-director of the event, discussed 
the conference’s central mission of 
celebrating members of the Ann Arbor 
community who inspire innovation.
“Ted is all about ideas worth 

spreading,” 
she 
said. 
“For 
us, 
TedxUofM is about finding those 
people who spread cool ideas in 
the Ann Arbor and University of 
Michigan community. We’re trying 
to foster a community of intellect and 
inspiration.”
She went on to reflect on the 
conference’s 
theme, 
“Absolute 
Zero,” which she expressed was 

intentionally ambiguous to allow for 
highly personal speaker reflections.
“We don’t have one interpretation 
(of absolute zero) in mind, that’s what 
we love about it — it’s so multifaceted,” 
she said. “It’s more holistic for our 
speakers to all be able to connect to 
it in different ways, it leads to a broad 
mix of ideologies.”

MAX KUANG/Daily
Former Associate Athletic Director and Life Coach Greg Harden talks about making challenging life decisions at the TedxUofM Absolute Zero Conference at the Power 
Center Friday evening.


Engineering 
freshman 
Paul 
Lellouche told The Daily after the 
event that TEdxUofM’s diversity of 
ideas allowed him to gain a broader 
worldview.
“It’s interesting to see what 
different people dedicate their 
lives to--which are not necessarily 
domains I am exposed to in my 
classes,” Lellouche said. “They 
are incredibly interesting, and 
they enrich my life by giving me 
different perspectives, which I 
appreciate a lot.”
David 
Kobrosky 
— 
LSA 
sophomore, Founder of Skatify 
and Co-Founder of Michigan 
Blockchain 
Skateboarding onto the stage, 
LSA sophomore David Kobrosky, 
founder of Skatify, an organization 
committed to building skate parks 
for emerging skate communities, 
discussed his love of skateboarding. 
In particular, he expressed it helps 
him see the world from a “ground 
zero” perspective, teaching him 
to 
constantly 
challenge 
prior 

assumptions.
“(Skateboarding) taught me to 
see the world as a jungle gym,” 
Kobrosky 
said. 
“Skateboarders 
see stairs and don’t think about 
what they are or why they exist. 
They simply think about how 
they want to interact with them… 
Seeing these stairs from an angle 
of curiosity and asking myself 
‘What can I do with these cement 
stairs?’ really taught me to see the 
world without prior assumptions 
or limitations.”
In his talk, Kobrosky discussed 
how he had to come up with non-
traditional designs for his skate 
parks in order to make them 
affordable and accessible in areas 
such as Ethiopia.
“This 
action 
of 
breaking 
assumptions is the only way 
change is possible,” Kobrosky said. 
“Seeing these other skaters around 
me breaking them inspired me to 
do the same… I’ve tried to look at 
the world from a skater mindset, 
a place where assumptions don’t 
exist, but rationality does.”
Aaron Dworkin — School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance Professor 

of 
Arts 
Leadership, 
Business 
Professor of Entrepreneur Studies
Using stories from his life, 
Prof. Aaron Dworkin reflected on 
his multi-racial, multi-spiritual 
background and the importance 
of giving throughout his talk. 
Dworkin is the founder of Sphinx 
Organization, an organization 
dedicated to building diversity 
and entrepreneurship in the 
arts, and was President Obama’s 
first appointment to the National 
Council on the Arts.
In his talk, he noted how the 
generosity of others forged him 
into the man he is today, both in 
his personal and professional life. 
He said the ethos of generosity 
should be founded on the joy 
giving brings.
“There is something unique 
about 
the 
human 
condition 
when we give,” Dworkin said. “I 
encourage you to give something 
of yourself every single day, 
beginning 
today. 
When 
you 
give, give an amount that gives 
meaning to you. The greater the 
value of what you give, the greater 
the impact will be on you.” 
Dworkin told the Daily after 
the event how transformative 
giving to others can be in in 
the larger community.
“I wanted to be able to 
connect my own background 
and my life trajectory and 
convey the types of things 
we can do when we do it 
collectively and bring about 
change at a scale,” Dworkin 
said. “And this idea that if 
everyone in the audience can 
think 
about 
intentionally 
giving 
something 
every 
single day – Will Ann Arbor 
change for the better? Will 
the University of Michigan 
change?”
Natalie Tronson — Assistant 
Professor of Psychology
Assistant 
professor 
of 
psychology Natalie Tronson 
discussed memory and its 
role in changing behavior. In 
particular, she highlighted 
memory disorders such as 
Alzheimer’s disease and post-
traumatic stress disorder.
Speaking to The Daily, 
Tronson reflected on her 
conception of “absolute zero” 
as a loss of memory.

“When I was starting to think 
about what I was going to talk 
about, I kept coming coming 
back to this idea of memory loss,” 
Tronson said. “This idea of, it’s 
not just absolute zero in terms 
of what you know, it’s in terms 
of function, in terms of how we 
construct our internal worlds.”
However, most instances of 
memory and memory loss serve 
functional value, Tronson said in 
her talk.
“Perhaps instead of thinking 
about 
memory 
as 
a 
vault 
where items get placed in and 
removed as needed, a concept 
that makes us all sound a little 
like robots, maybe we should 
think about memory as a flexible 
and 
functional 
map 
of 
the 
world,” Tronson said. “Perhaps 
if we think of memory not as 
information to be spat out, the 
grocery list we need to remember 
or information on the exam… but 
instead as this map that allows us 
to have conversations, find our 
way around the world… What is 
there to improve?”
Greg 
Harden 
— 
Former 
University Director of Athletic 
Counseling, Life Coach
Known as the “secret weapon” 
of 
Michigan 
Athletics, 
Greg 
Harden is a motivational speaker 
and life coach, training athletes 
from Tom Brady to Michael 
Phelps. His talk focused on 
the merits of optimism, and 
how individuals must practice 
maintaining positivity as they 
would any other skill.
“Practice, train, and rehearse: 
believe in yourself,” he said. 
“Understand you are no different 
from Desmond Howard, Tom 
Brady, Michael Phelps — they 
simply had a skill set. But they all 
had to believe, without question 
or pause, that they could have the 
world.”
In an interview with The Daily, 
Harden reflected further on a 
15-year-old girl he cared for as 
a clinical therapist, sharing the 
possibility of either going up or 
down when at an “absolute zero” 
point in life.

Even 
though 
the 
holiday 
created in honor of Martin Luther 
King Jr. is only technically one 
day, many people spend the whole 
latter half of January honoring his 
amazing legacy. Aside from the 
countless Instagram selfies posted 
with an MLK quote as the caption, 
many places hold a slew of events 
to commend the effect of his work 
on the world. The University of 
Michigan undeniably takes part 
in this practice. So as we leave 
behind the month that celebrated 

MLK and enter the one that 
rejoices in the work of other Black 
figures just like him, I have started 
to reflect on what exactly this 
truly inspirational man stood for.
During his lifetime, King spent 
his time advocating for the end 
of discrimination and racism 
against Black people as well as 
anti-segregation. Though this is 
by no means an exhaustive list, it 
captures the essence of what he 
cared about. When comparing his 
work to the current events that 
honor it, the main focus of the 
two don’t fully align. Many events 
across campus and across the 
country focus on the acceptance, 

open-mindedness 
and 
love 
needed to make integration work. 
However, a lot of these events 
seem to conveniently leave out 
the large parts of his efforts that 
went 
toward 
uplifting 
Black 
people specifically. This leaves 
me to wonder: Is MLK day being 
whitewashed? Are we celebrating 
the entirety of Martin Luther 
King’s work, or are we only 
acknowledging the parts of it that 
everyone is comfortable with? Let 
me explain further.
King didn’t spend his life 
fighting for the watered-down 
concept of togetherness that is 
often associated with his name 

today. He was largely about Black 
prosperity. Yes, King was for all 
people. Yes, he wanted people of 
all races to be treated based on 
their 
personal 
characteristics 
and not their social identities. But 
it is clear that he saw elevating 
Black people as an effective and 
important means to achieving 
the racial equality and equity 
that we still yearn for today. With 
his speeches and letters — take 
his Letter from Birmingham 
Jail and I Have a Dream Speech 
for example — he incorporated 
a mixture of encouragement 
and convincing. He encouraged 
Black people that the cause was 

worth the fight while convincing 
white people that Black people 
deserved 
American 
rights. 
Despite that, honoring King’s 
legacy 
by 
preaching 
respect 
and allyship towards the group 
he worked to liberate seems to 
be an undiscovered concept. It 
seems that any time there is a 
cause or a person that stands up 
for the improved livelihood of 
Black people, it/they will only 
be accepted if the message is 
repackaged. Black people have to 
be taken off center stage in order 
for the masses to find it necessary 
to care about what is being said.
Now don’t get me wrong, I have 

no problem with non-Black people 
being inspired by King. I have no 
problem with King’s words being 
used to further efforts that don’t 
revolve around Black people. And 
I definitely don’t believe that his 
name should be disassociated 
with the general idea of love and 
unity. However, when it comes to a 
day or event specifically dedicated 
to acknowledging King’s works 
and passions, Black people need to 
have a leading role in the narrative.
Like I said before, King was for 
all people. But he was especially 
for his people. Don’t forget that.

If retro was the official 
comeback of 2015, normcore 
greets 2019 with a warm 
welcome, especially in Korea. 
Walking down the streets of 
Seoul, a chilled plastic cup of 
Gong Cha bubble tea in hand, 
I venture out and by looking 
around, a horde of people 
clad in frayed stonewash 
jeans, thin linen shirts, and 
white tennis sneakers accost 
my vision. My realization 
was right - normcore fashion 
is getting big this year.
Starting from 2017 was the 
year normcore was pushed 
to 
the 
extreme, 
making 
it public to the masses. 
Normcore is the combination 
of the two words: “norm” 
and 
“hardcore”, 
basically 
meaning 
unpretentious, 
rather 
plain, 
flat-looking 
clothing 
that 
emphasizes 
comfort and similarity that 
is perceived as minimalistic-
chic. This reveals that it’s not 
the froufrou lace blouses and 
5-inch heels anymore - the 
“more 
comfortable, 
more 
stylish” vibe is dominating 
the fashion industry.
The Classy Fabulist Girl, 
Style Nanda
It’s an androgynous, unisex 
fashion trend that focuses 
on capturing self-awareness 
and 
stylized 
blandness. 
Rather than focusing on the 
designer or a particular type 
of pattern, normcore guides 
the people to pay attention to 
their own body shape and the 

clothing color that turns out 
to become ardently ordinary 
attire. It’s almost like an anti-
fashion sentiment, the beauty 
and art of blankness that 
makes normcore so sexy.
Normcore is especially big 
in South Korea. As the Korean 
community is a society of 
conformity, the whole idea of 
embracing the sameness, and 
seeking coolness among the 
sameness is easily absorbed 
into the culture. Sporting 
the whole “less is more” look, 
many Koreans are seen in 
the streets, walking around 
in comfy slacks, flats, and 
denim jackets or slouchy 
monochrome sweaters. The 
deliberate 
uniformity 
of 
ensembles unveil the reality 
that in fashion, one no longer 
has to make a statement or 
flaunt big names in order to 
be authentic; instead, casual 
and simple garments among 
the alikeness is what makes 
everyone 
different, 
and 
moreover, hip.
As a Korean myself, I also 
appreciate 
the 
particular 
aesthetic of normcore. It is 
something that you can just 
dress in without having to 
think about it too much, but 
at the same time it makes 
you look slouchy-chic. Some 
of my favorite normcore 
wardrobe pieces are soft 
black 
turtleneck 
sweater, 
high rise straight-leg jeans 
with 
a 
distressed 
hem, 
light grey ankle socks and 
white Nike Classic Cortez 
sneakers to finish the outfit 
off with a nice little touch. 
Since I would describe my 

personality as rather shy and 
introverted, normcore look 
is perfect for people like me 
who don’t want to stand out 
too much from others but 
still want to make a fashion 
statement.
On the contrary, some 
fashion critics contest that 
normcore is not a true fashion 
style. They argue that there 
seems to be a clear, distinct 
line that divides normcore 
and what actual fashion is. 
But to think about it, what 
is “true” fashion anyways? 
These 
sort 
of 
confines 
and limitations stifle our 
creativity to come up with 
more clothing combinations, 
and isn’t fashion supposed 
to be about adaptability and 
versatility anyways - to let 
in a diverse array of styles to 
create a unique, flourishing 
community? Normcore isn’t 
about giving into the status 
quo or becoming a bland, 
unified mess; it’s actually 
about 
discovering 
the 
opportunity for connection 
and eventually your sense 
of self in the midst of like-
minded 
individuals. 
By 
accommodating the norm, 
one can find true freedom by 
letting go of the pressure to 
look one-of-a-kind.
So 
why 
not 
try 
out 
normcore 
today? 
It 
guarantees 
convenience 
and open-minded style at 
the same time in the busy 
fast-paced buzz of city life, 
yet it gives room for self-
expression. Talk about the 
epitome of the real “cool”!

Less is more: The 
rise of normcore 
The story I was 
too afraid to share

Is MLK Day whitewashed?

As a child, my brother and 
I ran home from school every 
day so we wouldn’t miss any of 
our favorite shows. We watched 
PBS and Nickelodeon for hours 
with our eyes glued to the TV 
until our mom forced us to do 
our homework — which we 
worked 
on 
while 
watching 
“Arthur.” Most of the shows we 
watched were educational, some 
downright nonsensical — I’m 
looking at you “Caillou”— but all 
of them were entertaining and 
influential for impressionable 
minds like ours.
Yet one show stood out to me 
as particularly captivating. “The 
Simpsons” always broadcasted 
around 5 or 6 o’clock in the 
evening when the children cable 
networks switched to regular 
programming. A lot of elements 
drew me to the show — the 
slapstick humor, Bart’s school 
antics, Homer’s sheer idiocy — 

but who most appealed to me 
was the character Apu, an Indian 
immigrant from West Bengal.
When you grow up Asian-
American, you don’t see a lot 
of characters reflecting your 
identity. 
Many 
shows 
used 
animals or objects for characters, 
but if they were human, they were 
usually white. The Simpsons 
defied this standard with a 
more diverse set of characters. 
Much like how women are 
reassured to see a current 
House of Representatives that 
better 
represents 
them 
and 
their interests, audiences and 
especially children like to see 
television characters they can 
relate to.
And I certainly related to Apu. 
Apu owned a store, the Kwik-E-
Mart, just like my dad. Apu was 
a family-oriented person with a 
wife, kids, and relatives in India, 
and I have a big family too. I was 
vegetarian, he was vegan. We 
both practiced Hinduism. Apu 
thus seemed like an extension 
of my family representing my 

culture on national TV.
My appreciation for Apu made 
it surprising to discover the 
character recently came under 
fire for being a racist stereotype 
of South Asians. Comedian Hari 
Kondabolu’s documentary “The 
Problem With Apu” described 
how 
the 
character’s 
accent 
and occupation are a racist 
exaggeration of South Asian 
culture. 
Pakistani-American 
comedian 
Kumail 
Nanjiani 
said he was often told to do “the 
Apu accent.” I was shocked to 
discover that a character who 
I had grown up appreciating 
caused a great deal of shame for 
other South Asians. 
What’s more disappointing is 
how the show creators’ response 
to the controversy lacks a 
fundamental understanding of 
the problem itself. In regards to 
Apu and South Asians, former 
“Simpsons” 
producer 
Dana 
Gould told Kondabolu in his 
film that “Their accents by their 
nature 
to 
white 
Americans 
sound funny. Period.” He clearly 
isn’t aware that his audience 
isn’t and shouldn’t be just white 
Americans, nor does he get to 
mock a culture’s accent for the 
entertainment of another. The 
show 
attempted 
to 
address 
the criticisms in an episode 
about 
political 
correctness 
that provoked an even greater 
response. Hank Azaria, Apu’s 
voice actor and a white male, was 
respectful of the criticisms and 
said he is “happy to step aside” 
from the character. The character 
himself has had a reduced role for 

years, and reports indicated the 
show might just remove Apu to 
eliminate the controversy itself.
I was never offended by Apu’s 
character nor asked to do his 
accent, though I understand 
how the character is harmful 
to the South Asian community. 
Yet the proper response to the 
controversy is not to get rid of the 
character and avoid any possible 
issue. Following this logic, the 
creators would get rid of all 
attempts at humor involving 
minority characters out of a fear 
of going too far. “The Simpsons” 
would cease to be a diverse and 
representative show, thus failing 
to reflect a diverse American 
audience.
What the show should do 
instead is make Apu a more well-
crafted character. If the creators 
recruited South Asian writers 
to produce scenes that moved 
beyond stereotypes for humor, 
Apu would have more thought 
put into him. Azaria has been 
very receptive to public concerns 
about Apu. Though he has always 
been the voice of Apu, it would be 
more respectful for a South Asian 
actor to play the character for 
the representation to be real and 
genuine. The shift in voice would 
be jarring at first, but animated 
characters have changed voices 
before on many other shows. Apu 
can remain on “The Simpsons” 
without being a caricature, and 
with the right thought put behind 
him, the show can transform the 
character into the family man I 
saw in him years ago.
 

I am writing this almost a 
year later, wondering how it 
can still be taking over my life. 
It tears at my soul like a nasty 
disease; it pauses briefly, giving 
me a moment to gasp for air, 
before it sinks its claws back 
into me and pulls me under.
It was around this time 
last year that I was sexually 
assaulted by a person whom 
I once considered a friend, a 
teammate. It feels strange to put 
into writing an experience that 
I never felt comfortable enough 
to share with the world. For 
months I was terrified to speak 
of it, fearing the damage to my 
reputation and contemplating 
the irrevocable consequences. 
I lived in consternation of the 
possible responses: my friends 
would take sides, believing 
instead of me this older man 
who 
had 
completely 
taken 
advantage of my trust and 
fooled us all with his charm, his 
talent, his goofy personality.
He had been toying with 
my 
emotions 
for 
months 
beforehand, attempting to get 
me to confess my deepest and 
darkest demons to him. He 
acted like he was a hero saving 
me from my mental destruction. 
He’d say things like, “You never 
look like you’re having fun. 
Something is always bothering 
you, tell me what’s wrong.” 
What was wrong with me? Why 
did he assume that I’m plagued 

by some incurable illness? Did 
I wear my insecurities like 
a pair of glasses? I felt these 
questions percolate in my mind 
and found myself consumed 
with guilt and self-pity. But 
in retrospect, what was really 
wrong? It was his constant 
prodding for information that 

I was reluctant to share with 
him. Him thinking he could 
exploit our mutual respect and 
open me up to vulnerability 
I never really wanted. What 
was wrong was, months after 
this began, he continued to 
harass me, and even begged 
me one night: “Come on, 
you’re embarrassing yourself. 
Everyone is watching you. Let 
me take you home.”
I never forgave myself for 
what happened that night. I 
had nightmares, some of which 
became realities. I watched 
people I called my closest 
friends distance themselves, 
subtly at first but more blatantly 
as time progressed. I doubted 
every part of my integrity – as 
my story became murky in my 
mind, the truth buried itself 

deeper and deeper, finding quiet 
anchorage under all the invasive 
questions. I was accused of 
incorrectly 
associating 
my 
memories, of making up stories 
to garner attention. I was told 
not to tell my friends, who were 
“too young and impressionable 
to understand the situation.” I 
watched the people I trusted 
the most with my story cover 
it up in the most disappointing 
way. Ultimately, I was alienated 
from a group of people I once 
considered my family and from 
an organization that allowed me 
to practice the single brightest 
passion in my life: dance.
It 
took 
me 
a 
year 
to 
understand that what happened 
wasn’t 
my 
fault. 
It 
was 
completely beyond my control 
and unfairly stigmatized in 
my South Asian community. 
I accept that people have 
mistreated and disrespected 
me and I am writing this to 
tell other survivors of sexual 
assault that they don’t need to 
be embarrassed or scared of 
the consequences. If you decide 
to speak up do so courageously 
and know that there is an army 
of people willing to fight for you. 
After this traumatic experience, 
I began a healing process that is 
painful to bear, but beautifully 
hopeful. The process is like 
riding a roller coaster — there 
are 
anticipatory 
highs 
and 
careening lows, but the ride will 
eventually come to an end, and 
you will realize that you may 
be safe in your own skin once 
again.

How “The Simpsons” can fix Apu

I’ve loved to read for as long 
as I can remember. Words paint 
pictures, paint moments, paint 
stories for me. And man, do 
I love a good story. The more 
fantastic, the better. Don’t get 
me wrong, the real world is 
great (occasionally), but the 
worlds of fantasy are even better. 
Anything is possible. Anything 
is supposed to be possible.
Now if only I could find a 
good fantasy movie with a Black 
female lead who has badass 
magical powers. Because when 
I really think about it, those are 
practically non-existent. Reading 
fantasy and sci-fi novels inspired 
me to start writing myself. From 
a young age, I found myself 
writing stories with white main 
characters, 
white 
secondary 
characters and white everybody 
else. It took some years for me to 
see the problem with this and the 
reason it was like this in the first 
place.
For one reason or another, I 
struggled to see a main character 
who was like me, Black and 
female. Plain and simple. Except 
it isn’t simple at all. Being older 
now, I realize that I was making 
stories like the ones I had read. 
Not content-wise, but in the way 
that I had majority, if not all, 
white characters. And I thought 
that this was a weird thing, a 
solely me thing.
But 
after 
seeing 
novelist 
Chimamanda 
Adichie’s 
TED 
Talk entitled: “The Danger of 
a Single Story,” I realized that 
no, I was not the only Black girl 

this happened to. What she said 
resonated with me even more 
as a fellow Nigerian. But what 
really got to me was that she 
said she was writing stories with 
white people and she was a little 
girl living in Nigeria. I’m telling 
you now, as someone who has 
visited multiple times, there is 
no prevalent white population 
in Nigeria. Yet she was making 
up stories like the ones she read, 
where the girls had pale skin and 
blonde hair.
Knowing I wasn’t the only 
one that had been influenced by 
that helped me feel less... guilty. 
But also made me realize what a 
problem that was. As a Black girl 
growing up, there were no Harry 
Potter equivalents that looked 
like me. Never any special Black 
girl chosen to be the heroine, who 
had the power to save the world. 
If there were any Black or dark-
skinned characters at all, they 
were background characters or 
the protagonist’s best friend.
It’s a little different now. 
I’ve found more fantasy genre 
literature 
written 
by 
Black 
women with Black female leads 
who are the chosen ones, who 
have the power to save the 
world, and are as kickass as they 
come. And all I can think is how 
I wish I’d read books like this 
growing up, how I wish I’d seen 
movies like that. Because it’s 
so so important that little Black 
girls everywhere know, that little 
Black girls believe that they can 
be heroines too, not just white 
people. And I want to write that 
Black fantasy and let them know 
that there is such a thing as Black 
Girl Magic.

T

here is little doubt that 
the reporting about the 
bad — and sometimes 

illegal 
— 
behavior 

of 
prominent 
men 

has led to important 
change in terms of 
how we think about 
and 
acknowledge 

sexual 
assault 
and 

violence. When the 
reporting on sexual 
assault in Hollywood 
and the media began 
to lead to real change, 
I was disturbed and 
a bit nervous but mostly grateful 
for the women and men who 
stood up to tell their story. A year 
and half later, it is necessary to 
reflect on the movement and 
assess how well we have done 
right by its victims.

Though the initial wave of 

public allegations has dwindled, 
reports of sexual assault by 
powerful 
men 
continue 
to 

emerge. The most recent public 
person to be accused of sexual 
assault is Virginia Lt. Gov. 
Justin Fairfax. On Feb. 3, reports 
surfaced of Vanessa Tyson’s 
allegation that Fairfax, then a 
John Kerry staffer, forced her to 
perform oral sex at a hotel room 
during the 2004 Democratic 
National Convention. Five days 
later, Meredith Watson released 
a statement in which she detailed 
that Fairfax raped her while 
they were both students at Duke 
University in 2000.

After the accusations that 

Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam 
wore blackface, many assumed 
Fairfax, the only Black person 
to hold statewide office in 
Virginia, would ascend to the 
top 
of 
the 
commonwealth’s 

government. Once the sexual 
assault 
allegations 
surfaced, 

Fairfax did initially receive some 
backlash, including some calls for 
resignation and impeachment. 
However, those calls have been 
walked back.

Only two weeks after these 

allegations, this story has fallen 
out of the news. Even when it was 
in the news, this story did not 
receive the same backlash and 
fury that the allegations against 
producer Harvey Weinstein, Sen. 
Al Franken or even Alabamian 
Senate candidate Roy Moore did. 
Why isn’t there a collective rage 
on the behalf of Fairfax’s victims? 
Why aren’t there protests or social 
media 
campaigns 
attempting 

to get justice for Vanessa Tyson 
or Meredith Watson? Why does 
it seem like sexual violence 
against Black women is treated 
differently than sexual violence 
against white women?

Let’s review.
The first report of assault 

allegations in a major newspaper 
against singer R. Kelly was 
published in 2000. The report 
included having sex with a minor, 
which is particularly problematic 
given the age of consent in 
Illinois is 17. There were also 
several lawsuits filed against R. 
Kelly for having sex with minors 
and recording sex acts without 
consent between 2001 and 2002. 
Again in 2017, physical and 

emotional abuse allegations were 
reported against Kelly. Though 
Kelly was arrested in 2003 on 

charges of possession 
of child pornography, 
he was only arrested 
on multiple counts 
of 
sexual 
abuse 

charges 
last 
week. 

He 
continues 
to 

make money on his 
streamable 
music, 

some of which contain 
allusions 
to 
his 

heinous crimes.

In 2004, comedian 

Bill Cosby was accused of sexual 
assault by Andrea Constand, 
and a year later, Tamara Green 
also came forward with similar 
allegations dating back to the 
1970s. Since then, 60 other 
women have accused him of 
sexual assault, some including 
being 
drugged 
and 
then 

assaulted. It was not until April 
2018 that Cosby was convicted 
on three counts of aggravated 
indecent assault and sentenced to 
three to 10 years in prison.

Harvey 
Weinstein 
was 

removed from the Weinstein 
Company within three days 
of the first reporting about his 
illegal behavior. Matt Lauer was 
similarly fired from NBC one 
day after allegations surfaced. 
Even 
more 
recent, 
Ryan 

Adams’s music was shelved 
after reporting by The New York 
Times of his abusive behavior 
toward women.

Why are some men delivered 

swift, severe punishment while 
others continue to hold societal 
power? We should look to their 
victims. From this pattern, it 
seems clear that men whose 
victims are primarily upper-
class, often socially powerful 
white women receive harsher 
repercussions than those whose 
victims are not.

When 
Prof. 
Christine 

Blasey 
Ford 
accused 
then-

Supreme Court nominee Brett 
Kavanaugh of sexual assault, 
there was an outcry against his 
nomination, as there should 
have been. Just like Harvey 
Weinstein, Matt Lauer and 
others should absolutely face 
serious and hefty punishment 
for 
their 
actions. 
Yet, 
the 

allegations 
against 
Justin 

Fairfax seem to have faded to 
the background. Few, if any, 
continue to draw attention to 
the charges against him.

The problem is not that 

people are outraged on the 
behalf of white survivors. The 
problem is that people are not 
as equally outraged on the 
behalf of Black survivors. It 

should not have taken almost 
20 years for R. Kelly to receive 
(some) 
punishment 
for 
his 

actions, nor should it have taken 
14 years for Bill Cosby to be 
convicted for his. And it should 
not take just as long for Justin 
Fairfax to face repercussions if 
an investigation confirms the 
allegations against him.

Additionally, 
a 
study 

published 
by 
researchers 

at 
SUNY 
Geneseo 
in 
The 

Psychology of Women Quarterly 
found that white women are less 
likely to intervene in a sexual 
assault if the victim is Black. 
According to the researchers, 
they 
“found 
that 
although 

white 
students 
correctly 

perceived that Black women 
were at risk in a pre-assault 
situation, they tended not to feel 
as personally involved in the 
situation.” The white female 
bystanders reported they felt 
“less personal responsibility” 
and that the Black victims 
“experienced more pleasure in 
the pre-assault situation.”

While the woman who 

coined #MeToo, Tarana Burke, 
has been doing work on behalf 
of women of color since the 
‘90s, the rest of us risk failing 
the movement if we primarily 
focus on the experiences of 
white women. The assault 
of any woman deserves our 
attention and empathy, but 
most 
sexual 
assaults 
and 

rapes take place where other 
oppressions 
already 
exist. 

This means that women who 
hold 
other 
marginalized 

identities 
are 
particularly 

vulnerable to sexual assault, 
specifically 
because 
they 

hold even less societal power. 
These groups include women 
of color, disabled women and 
queer women.

There is an existing and 

growing 
sect 
of 
feminists 

who work to end oppression 
that 
intersects 
at 
multiple 

marginalized identities in ways 
that create new and overlapping 
oppressions — also known as 
intersectional feminists. Still, 
most of society and mainstream 
media are not considering the 
sexual victimhood of black 
women as wholly distinct and 
important to address. This is 
absolutely unacceptable.

White women must make 

anti-racism 
a 
fundamental 

pillar of our feminism if our 
goal is to achieve real and 
tangible change to improve 
women’s lives. Our work must 
first focus on the oppressions 
of those most marginalized, 
because only through helping 
those most marginalized can 
we dismantle entire systems of 
oppression themselves.

Audre Lorde once said, “I 

am not free while any woman is 
unfree, even when her shackles 
are very different from my 
own,” and the truth of her 
words persists today.

Goodbye Opportunity, hello opportunity

O

n Feb. 13, the Earth 
said a bittersweet final 
farewell to one of the 

greatest accomplishments in space 
history: the Mars rover known 
as 
Opportunity. 
Opportunity, 

or “Oppy” as some call it, went 
silent last June when a planet-
wide sandstorm developed and 
likely covered solar panels used 
to power the rover, leaving Oppy 
unable to recharge its batteries. 
In 
a 
hauntingly 
beautiful 

last 
transmission, 
Oppy’s 

communication translated to, “My 
batteries are low, and it’s getting 
dark.” Words haven’t choked me 
up that much since hearing Peter 
Parker whisper, “Mr. Stark, I 
don’t feel so good” in Tony’s ear in 
“Avengers: Infinity War.”

Opportunity, along with its 

partner rover Spirit, launched 
in 2003 as a part of the Mars 
Exploration Rover mission. What 
was originally slated as a 90-day 
mission to search for evidence of 
past water on Mars turned into a 
much longer journey, with Spirit 
becoming embedded in soil in 2009, 
losing communication in 2010 and 
its mission officially ending in 2011, 
and Oppy lasting an incredible 15 
years on the red planet’s surface. 
Between the two rovers, NASA 
was able to collect enough evidence 
to conclude that water did indeed 
once flow on Mars. This was 
a 
monumental 
discovery 
that 

changed how we view our sister 
planet and the possibilities of space 
exploration itself.

In many ways, Oppy represented 

the best qualities of scientific 
exploration. It highlighted what can 
be accomplished with unlimited 
curiosity, dedication to exploring 
the unknown and commitment to 
cooperation. It has earned its place 
as a legend in the space history 
book, but we must not let its mission 
stop 
here. 
Opportunity’s 
last 

transmission should be a rallying 
point for humanity to again push our 
limits and aim further than we ever 
have before. Our next goal should be 
putting humans on Mars; moreover, 
we ought to strive to establish a 
full-time colony. This task is no 
easy feat, but with hard work and 
determination, it is entirely within 
our grasp — to boldly go where no 
one has gone before.

To many, such an aspiration 

may very well seem like a plot from 
Star Trek, but realistically, it is 
much more science than science-
fiction. If we focus our resources 
and concentrate on a clear target, 
reaching Mars may be easier than 
we think. During the Cold War and 
the infamous space race between 
the U.S. and the Soviet Union, 
former President John F. Kennedy 
stood before a nation and declared 
we would put a man on the moon. 
It wasn’t a question of “if,” but a 
matter of “when.” He famously 
inspired a generation when he said, 
“We choose to go to the moon and 
these other things, not because 
they are easy, but because they are 
hard.” After a few years of intensive 
research and experimenting, the 
U.S. was able to see Neil Armstrong 
take those first few historic steps 
across the lunar landscape. When 
we decided to go to the moon, we 
didn’t have the technology yet, 
just an idea and old-fashioned 
American determination. The same 
ideas can apply to Mars if we truly 
want it to.

Unfortunately, 
after 
the 

success of the Apollo missions, 
former President Richard Nixon 
fundamentally 
changed 
the 

space program. He reeled in 
U.S. ambitions by ending human 
spaceflight 
beyond 
low 
Earth 

orbit and did not embark on a 
new space exploration goal that 
would require huge investments 
like Apollo. From then on, NASA’s 
human spaceflight was limited to 
the space shuttle program and the 
International Space Station, until 
former President George W. Bush 
began phasing out space shuttle 
missions after the tragedy of the 
2003 Columbia mission killed 7 
astronauts. Since 2010, the U.S. 

has been entirely dependent on 
Russia for getting our astronauts to 
space, though that has the potential 
to change, as President Donald 
Trump said in the recent State of 
the Union that “this year, American 
astronauts will go back to space on 
American rockets.” This is likely in 
reference to the SpaceX test flight 
scheduled for later this year.

There are those who say space 

exploration is a waste of resources 
and that money spent on space would 
be better used here on Earth funding 
schools, health care or defense. 
While I understand where doubters 
are coming from, history provides 
evidence contrary to this notion. In 
order to get to the moon, we had to 
develop technology at a faster rate 
than ever before, and the side-effects 
of that kind of development are 
technologies that vastly improved 
our lives. Cell-phone cameras, CAT 
scan machines, athletic shoes, water 
purification systems, memory foam, 
baby formula and artificial limbs are 
just some of the products of space 
travel research.

If that is what we could do then, 

imagine the possibilities that could 
come from a mission to Mars now. 
The potential is almost incalculable, 
and just one of many reasons going to 
Mars is worthwhile.

In 1969, the entire world watched 

proudly as humanity took a giant leap 
forward into the future. Now, 50 years 
later in 2019, we have the opportunity 
to accomplish the impossible again, 
the ability to achieve something 
even those who watched the moon 
landing live could not imagine being 
feasible. Reaching Mars is that new 
impossible possibility. I’m not sure 
exactly what it is about exploration 
that has captivated the human mind 
for so long — the thing that pushes 
us into the unknown. Regardless 
of what it is that drives us, we need 
to listen to the call, embrace the 
uncertainty and dive headfirst into 
discovery. While we have just closed 
a significant chapter on the quest for 
Mars, the next one is just beginning. 
We owe it to ourselves and to future 
generations to not squander the 
next opportunity to explore Mars.

When the victims are not white

I

n 2002, The Boston Globe 
uncovered and exposed 
systematic sex abuse in 

the Catholic Church. These 
discoveries 
paved 
the 
way 

for 
thousands 
more 
abuse 

scandals to be uncovered, and 
put the Catholic Church under 
scrutiny for the next 17 years. 
The reporting was so inspiring 
that the movie “Spotlight” was 
created to tell the true story of 
how these crimes came to light.

The true story “Spotlight” 

tells is this: Sexual abuse 
runs rampant in the Catholic 
Church, 
and 
the 
scandal 

goes all the way up to the 
Vatican. The Boston Globe 
wrote 600 articles about the 
scandals, which lead to public 
accusations against 271 clergy 
members, and brought more 
than 1,000 survivors in Boston 
to step forward. In that year, 
BishopAccountability.org also 
came out with a list of places 
where major abuse allegations 
have been found. On that list 
there were two Michigan cities: 
Detroit and Grand Rapids. But if 
this was in 2002, it has definitely 
been taken care of by now, right?

Flash forward to 2018: the 

Pennsylvania grand jury. A 
grand jury report exposed that 
more than 300 Catholic priests 
were credibly accused of abuse 
in August, focusing specifically 
on six Pennsylvania diocese. It 
found that hundreds of priests 
abused 
children 
and 
that 

church officials helped cover 
it up. Since then, states like 
New York, Illinois, Missouri, 
Nebraska and New Mexico 
have also begun working to 
investigate the scandals in the 
Catholic Church. Priests from 
cities all over the nation joined 
the cacophony of voices rising 
up in protest and began to issue 
statements 
condemning 
the 

cycle of abuse and cover-ups 
that have overrun the church. 
But that did not even come 
close to solving the issue.

Now, in 2019, Pope Francis 

issued a statement on the 

fact that nuns have been 
consistently 
abused 
by 

clergymen — another scandal 
that has been covered up 
for decades. These women 
have had children and forced 
abortions due to the abuse and 
rape they endured from their 
own superiors. Some have been 
reduced to sexual slavery at 
the hands of many of men in 
their dioceses. These kinds of 
abuses have been happening 
all over the world; a report last 
year released cases of abuse in 
Europe, Africa, Asia and South 
America. And this is the first 
time the Pope has issued any 
statement about the abuse of 
nuns and the first time it has 
been a big part of the general 
news cycle.

Many nuns issued reports 

as far back as the 1990s, only 
to be ignored and silenced. In 
1996, there was a study from 
Saint Louis University that 
uncovered the sexual trauma 
endured by nuns from Catholic 
priests. Some of the abused 
nuns did not share any of this 
information, even with their 
own community, for fear of not 
being believed or even being 
punished by their superiors. 
Others came forth long ago 
but were ignored. For a long 
time the cycle of silence in this 
particular community was too 
great to break. But now that it 
has been broken, the floodgates 
have opened.

The cover-up is one of the 

most disturbing parts of this 
already 
horrifying 
issue. 

It made clear that some of 
the highest officials of the 
church were culprits, whether 
they were an abuser or an 
accomplice. Even those who 
have been accused of doing 
nothing are not in fact doing 
nothing. They are assisting 
the abusers by turning a blind 
eye to their crimes, relocating 
them when the crime is found 
out and keeping them within 
the church. Allowing the abuse 
to continue under their watch 
is almost as bad as committing 
the abuse in the first place and 
they deserve repercussions for 
their actions.

With such a deeply rooted 

tradition of covering up instead 
of facing the allegations, when 
will the scandals end? Will we 
ever get to the bottom of this 
issue? Right now it seems like 
there is a new scandal coming 
out every day. After 17 years, 
we are just beginning to skim 
the surface of these atrocities. 
Pope Francis has stated: “I 
think it is still going on because 
something does not stop just 
because 
you 
have 
become 

aware of it.” It is not enough for 
this to have been uncovered. 
The Catholic Church needs 
to take action and rectify the 
situation. And this will only 
come through rooting out all 
the abusers and starting fresh 
with new policies to prevent 
this from ever happening again. 
Several 
U.S. 
bishops 
have 

already proposed developing a 
code of conduct and creating a 
committee to develop policies, 
but few concrete changes are 
being enacted now. What is a 
clear course of action right now 
is removing all known abusers 
and 
accomplices 
from 
the 

ranks of the Catholic Church; 
neither 
should 
be 
allowed 

to stay in power. “Spotlight” 
paved the way, but now the 
Catholic Church must walk 
down it, either to restoration or 
retribution.

The Ann Arbor Symphony 
Orchestra and select pianists 
from the Doctor of Musical 
Arts program in the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance 
performed a two-part series of 
classical orchestra pieces at Hill 
Auditorium over the weekend 
on Friday and Saturday nights.
Upon 
entering 
the 
auditorium, 
I 
immediately noticed 
that people of all ages 
were present. I saw 
some who looked to be 
seasoned symphony-
goers, while others, 
apparently 
new 
parents, 
brought 
along their smiling 
toddlers, all of whom 
seemed to enjoy the 
performance — even 
those too young to 
be able to verbally 
communicate it.
At 
the 
Friday 
night performance, I 
spoke with audience 
member Stevie King, 
who said that she had 
come to the performance to 
support her coworker, who is a 
flutist in the orchestra. She also 
brought along her husband, who 
is a pianist himself, in the hopes 
that he would enjoy the work of 
Claudio Espejo and Hsiu-Jung 
Hou. I also spoke with Palmer, 
a senior at the University of 
Michigan and a member of the 
University’s Men’s Glee Club, 
who said he wanted to attend 
more events in Ann Arbor 
before he graduates. “It’s free 
and a good study break,” said 
Palmer during intermission. 
He has been on the stage at Hill 
with the Glee Club many times, 
but as he states, “It is nice to 
just be an audience member.” I 

spoke with another gentleman 
who owns two houses: one 
in Ann Arbor and another in 
New Hampshire. After seeing 
an ad in the Record, he and 
his wife decided to attend 
the 
performance, 
as 
they 
“like to see what humans are 
capable of.” It was apparent 
that the Ann Arbor Symphony 
Orchestra and DMA pianists 
attracted audience members 
from both the University and 

the greater Ann Arbor area.
Both performances utilized 
the talents of Robert Broadman 
as guest conductor. Broadman 
was Artistic Director of Live 
from Orchestra Hall, the free 
worldwide webcasts of the 
Detroit Symphony Orchestra, 
until he was appointed the 
position of Interim Director of 
Orchestral Studies at Eastern 
Michigan University in 2018. 
Broadman is also the winner 
of several prestigious musical 
awards, including the first 
place award in 2018 and 2015 
for The American Prize and 
Maestro Vytautas Marijosius 
Memorial Award in Orchestral 
Programming. 
Watching 

Broadman 
conduct 
with 
intense passion was artistic. 
His face would get beet-red 
and his movements fast and 
violent as the crescendos of 
his orchestra bid him to. He 
seemed to physically muscle 
through 
the 
symphony, 
as 
though he needed to exhaust 
himself to pull the music out of 
the written page and out onto 
the orchestra. I am certain that 
this man was hypertensive for a 
significant portion of 
the performance.
“Finale: 
Alla 
breve” is a piece from 
Piano Concerto no. 
3 in D Minor, op. 30 
composed by Sergei 
Rachmaninoff. 
It 
was 
played 
during 
the 
Friday 
night 
performance 
with 
Hsiu-Jung Hou at the 
piano. Hou presented 
in a deep maroon 
dress that looked like 
a point of color amid 
the blackness of the 
orchestra from which 
the orchestra fanned 
out from Hou and 
her piano, adding a 
bit of colorful drama 
to the already-dramatic piece. 
“Finale” was played with such 
vigor and passion that it was 
as though the listener has 
been sent down a winding road 
filled with both triumph and 
melancholy.
The 
Saturday 
night 
performance brought with it 
some of the best classical piano 
I have ever heard, courtesy 
of Eun Young Lee, Mi-Eun 
Kim, 
and 
Ji-Hyang 
Gwak. 
The combined performances 
on Friday and Saturday night 
further showcased the talent 
housed in Ann Arbor and the 
University, and its capability to 
draw in audiences from in and 
around the area.

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW

“Documentary 
Now!,” 
the 
brainchild of four very successful 
“Saturday Night Live” alumni 
(Seth Meyers, Fred Armisen, 
Bill Hader, Rhys Thomas), takes 
the best elements of the latter’s 
sketches and extends them into 
bite-size mockumentaries. Very 
often, 
these 
mockumentaries 
skillfully straddle the line of 
surreal 
and 
somehow 
perfectly 
believable, 
taking 
real 
documentaries 
and turning up 
the 
dial 
ever 
so 
slightly 
on 
every 
aspect 
of 
production. 
Season 
3 
(or 
Season 
52 
as 
the 
show 
calls 
it) 
begins 
with 
an 
ambitious, 
yet 
perfectly 
executed parody 
of “Wild Wild Country,” aptly 
named “Batsh*t Valley.”
The mockumentary tells the 
story of coked-up cult leader, 
Ra-Shawbard 
(Owen 
Wilson, 
“Cars 3”), who takes his groups of 
followers to a small Oregon town 
called Chinook. The townspeople 
are perplexed, but welcome the 
new residents anyway. They are 
amused by the cult’s insistence 
on, for example, making sure the 
vegetables they eat give them 
permission to be eaten. On the 
other hand, they are less amused 

by the frequent, loud orgies that 
become a point of conflict.
The story is told through a 
mix of old newsreel footage and 
present-day interviews of former 
cult members and FBI agent 
Bill Dawes (Michael Keaton, 
“Spider Man: Homecoming”). 
There’s rarely a line of wasted 
dialogue, and the tension that 
escalates between the cult and 
the townspeople becomes so 
engaging it’s hard to forget 
how batsh*t it all actually is. 

You might just believe for a 
second that you are in fact 
watching a documentary about 
a Jonestown-esque cult, but 
then 
the 
show 
throws 
out 
something remarkably absurd 
such as “orgasm jars,” where 
cult members must scream their 
pleasure into a jar in order to 
preserve it for future moments of 
darkness.
Even more impressive than 
Wilson’s 
woozy 
cult 
leader 
performance was that of Nescar 
Zadegan (“The Good Doctor”) 

as cult spokesman “Ra-Sharir.” 
She is a truly detestable villain: 
Her checkered past and dark 
turn lay the groundwork for the 
second half, where the show 
truly goes insane, reminiscent of 
the final fight sequence in “Hot 
Fuzz.” Like when it is revealed 
that the names of cult members 
are just anagrams of the names of 
Steelers players (“Ra-Shawbard” 
is derived from Terry Bradshaw). 
Yet, within the framework that 
the episode develops for itself, 
all the events still 
seem 
strangely 
natural.
“Batsh*t 
Valley” 
features 
an 
impressive 
attention 
to 
detail in the way 
it 
parodies 
its 
source 
material. 
The most absurd 
aspects of the cult 
are detailed in the 
same manner-of-
fact tone as “Wild 
Wild 
Country,” 
and some specific 
characters 
will 
be instantly recognizable to 
fans of the show. However, it is 
absolutely not necessary to have 
watched “Wild Wild Country” 
to enjoy this, and like any show 
made by Fred Armisen and Bill 
Hader that I have ever watched, I 
can guarantee several references 
and jokes went over my head. And 
that’s what makes “Documentary 
Now!” continue being so brilliant. 
Even though it may not be for 
everyone, everyone can indeed 
find their own way to enjoy it and 
marvel at its absurdity.

‘Now!’ returns even better

TV REVIEW

One 
symptom 
of 
the 
streaming 
era 
is 
that 
making 
a 
statement 
with 
an album cover has become 
an underappreciated art. A 
byproduct of albums going 
from 12-inch physical records 
to Spotify thumbnails on a 
phone screen, it’s much easier 
to overlook album art (that’s 
not to say we didn’t have 
awful album covers 20 years 
ago).
However, a cover can be an 
important part of an album’s 
legacy, and artists should treat 
it as such. It’s the first thing 
a listener sees and can be an 
important part of framing the 
experience. Hip hop is a genre 
founded on sending a message 
with words, and a picture 
tells a thousand words.
So, what makes good album 
art?
When 
talking 
about 
album art in hip hop, most 
people will point to older 
album covers as the greatest. 
Naturally, the first ingredient 
to a classic album cover is that 
the album itself will stand the 
test of time. Those classics set 
the example for good artwork.
First, take what is arguably 
hip hop’s greatest album cover 
(an argument that I’ll fight 
for tooth-and-nail) from the 
classic group A Tribe Called 
Quest. The Low End Theory, 
hailed as one of the greatest 
and 
most 
influential 
hip-
hop records of all time, was 
an innovation in both sound 
and cover design. The dark 
cover features a woman with 
vibrant red and green body 
paint across her body, posed 
on her knees and shot from 
the side. The woman in body 
paint was eye-catching, sexy 
and Afrocentric, capturing 
the essence not only of A 
Tribe Called Quest, but of hip 
hop as a genre. Today she is a 
timeless logo for hip hop.
A 
good 
album 
tells 
a 
story, and so does a good 
cover. 
N.W.A.’s 
politically 
charged debut, Straight Outta 
Compton, had many stories to 
tell about the realities of gang 
life in Compton, California. 
So does its threatening cover. 
In the photo, the group stares 
menacingly over the camera 
with the skyscrapers of LA 

towering behind them. Eazy-E 
points a gun at the viewer.
There is indeed a tale to 
the photo on the cover. As 
told to NME by photographer 
Eric Poppleton, “We were in 
downtown Los Angeles ... I 
just lay on the ground and 
they pointed what hopefully 
was an unloaded gun down at 
the camera. I couldn’t say for 
sure whether it was ready to 
fire, but it was definitely a real 
gun. There wasn’t anything 
fake back then.”
Personally, I like to think 
Eazy had the gun loaded.
The 
cover 
of 
Straight 
Outta Compton captured the 
essence of gangsta rap in the 
late ‘80s and early ‘90s, but 
The Pharcyde was the first 
hip-hop group to defy the 
trend that N.W.A. pioneered. 
Their debut, Bizarre Ride II 
the Pharcyde, featured an 
outrageous cover showing the 
four eccentric emcees riding 
a rollercoaster into a toothy 
vagina. And that works — it’s 
an album about goofy shit. 
Few artists were going against 
the grain in sound during the 
era saturated in gangsta rap, 
and The Pharcyde took their 
sonic rebellion to the extreme 
with their lighthearted humor 
— and album art to match.
To answer the question, 
good album art is iconic, 
a symbol of the music, the 
artist, and the era of hip hop 
that it falls in. Good album 
art is beautiful, drawn by 
artists 
with 
a 
vision, 
or 
photographed with care. But 
most importantly, it captures 
the essence of the album. 
Music is an experience, and 
the cover is a part of that 
experience.
And just as hip hop has 
spread its influence in sound, 
so has it started trends in 
visuals with iconic album 
covers.
A major theme in hip hop 
is innocence gone early, a 
product of the dangerous 
communities that many hip 
hop stars have grown up in. 
The album that kicked this 
trend off is the masterpiece 
Illmatic, featuring a young 
Nas superimposed over the 
Queensbridge projects. The 
Notorious B.I.G. followed suit 
with a baby picture on Ready 
to Die, which was the subject 
of many disses for biting Nas. 
Contrary to popular belief, the 

child on the cover is not Biggie 
himself — it was a kid from 
the Bronx booked through a 
modeling agency. The baby 
picture album cover theme 
would make waves, with baby 
photos gracing the covers of 
some of the biggest albums 
in the next millennium: Lil 
Wayne on Tha Carter III, 
Kendrick Lamar on Good Kid, 
M.A.A.D. City and Drake on 
Nothing Was the Same.
The comic book-inspired 
cover trend was extremely 
prevalent in hip hop in the 
’90s, 
but 
has 
since 
died 
down, with Czarface being 
the only group still pumping 
out albums with beautiful 
comic covers. Many amazing 
works of art came out of this 
trend, 
however. 
Earlier 
I 
talked about Bizarre Ride II 
the Pharcyde as the model 
cartoony album cover, but 
several other iconic covers 
followed 
afterwards, 
such 
as GZA’s Liquid Swords, MF 
DOOM’s Operation Doomsday 
and Wu-Massacre from the 
Wu-Tang anthology.
The 
most 
recent 
phenomenon in album art has 
been the “meme cover.” Over 
the last few years, the most 
memorable album covers have 
been ones that go viral online. 
Fans can even generate their 
own album covers inspired by 
Views, The Life of Pablo and Ye. 
Snapchat users have a sticker 
of their bitmoji inspired by 
DAMN. Album cover parodies 
aren’t a new phenomenon 
by any means. Fans have 
probably made thousands of 
variations of famous album 
covers like Abbey Road and 
The Dark Side of the Moon. But 
in recent years, memed-out 
hip-hop album covers have 
been making the rounds on 
Twitter more and more.
Even if it takes a back 
seat today, the pursuit of 
innovative cover design is still 
alive. Japanese contemporary 
artist 
Takashi 
Murakami, 
the 
man 
behind 
Kanye 
West’s 
Graduation 
cover, 
designed one of hip hop’s 
most wallpaper-able covers 
with KIDS SEE GHOSTS, an 
instant vinyl purchase for 
me. The cover of Tyler, the 
Creator’s Flower Boy is both 
surreal and beautiful, painted 
by Ann Arbor native Eric 
White. Here’s to future classic 
album covers to come.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

While reading Maria Popova’s “Figuring,” I was thinking a 
lot about the old science of alchemy, the medieval precursor to 
chemistry. Before we knew about atoms or different theories of 
electron orbitals and magnetism to explain why materials work 
the way they do, there was alchemy — the practice of trying to 
transform one substance into another. One of the most legendary 
and mythical alchemic practices included the process of making 
an ordinary substance into liquid gold.
“Figuring” isn’t quite a work of science fiction or biography. 
It’s also not quite poetry, not quite prose, not exactly a short 
story collection — and yet it’s also kind of all of these things. It’s 
a work of alchemy in the oldest, most classical use of the word. 
It’s a tapestry, woven out of the stories of various scientists and 
writers throughout history, connecting history, memory and 
personal experience to theories of astronomy, theoretical physics 
and ecology. Maria Popova transforms scientific logic and reason 
into poetry and poetry into calculus. In her hands, biography 
becomes liquid gold. Popova examines the lives of the people 
usually excluded from science writing (mostly queer women) and 
in doing so, crafts a narrative about the way people move through 
history and the way they perceive the scope of the universe. As 
Virginia Woolf would describe it, “Figuring” is “no longer rooted, 
but gold flowing.”
It would all be painfully overwrought and embarrassing if 
Popova wasn’t such a skilled writer and scholar, or such a deeply 
empathetic and human storyteller. “Figuring” doesn’t succeed in 
spite of its grand ambition and scope, but because of it. Clocking 
in at over 500 pages, “Figuring” is a dense and intricate read, but 
Popova’s writing is clear and simple, designed to draw people 
in rather than alienate. She doesn’t obfuscate for the sake of it. 
The complexity is earned, even necessary for the tapestry she’s 
creating.
The book takes a semi-biographical structure, with each 
chapter marking a new intersection of a different person’s life 
and work. Where other writers might draw a line between 
personal and professional lives, Popova finds such distinctions 
counterproductive to authentic discourse. In an early chapter 
about the famous 19th century astronomer Maria Mitchell, Popova 
imagines the woman who would go on to become the first working 
female astronomer, the woman who would later discover a brand 
new comet, at 12 years old, staring up at the sky. “I imagine this 
contained young woman surprising herself with a spontaneous 
gasp when she sees what she saw at half past 10 that first day in 

October in 1847,” Popova writes.
The book is full of quiet moments like this. Science to Popova 
is anything but clinical — it’s full of wonder, emotion and love. 
She approaches discovery as a reverential space where people 
are at their very best, describing it as, “ ... the ecstasy of having 
personally chipped a small fragment of knowledge from the 
immense monolith of the unknown, that elemental motive force of 
every sincere scientist.” The sincerity is key here: Popova isn’t just 
uninterested in cynicism — she actively combats it. Each story she 
tells and each figure she highlights is a testament to achievement, 
to bravery, to the exact point where memory and future meet. If 
her language is flowery and poetic, it’s on purpose. She explains 
this with a quote from environmentalist and ecologist Rachel 
Carson’s journal, writing that “If there is wonder and beauty and 

magic … science will discover these qualities. If they are not there, 
science cannot create them. If there is poetry in my book about 
the sea, it is not because I deliberately put it there, but because no 
one could write truthfully about the sea and leave out the poetry.”
In another break from traditional science writing, Popova 
is entirely uninterested in the myth of the unencumbered lone 
genius. “There is no such thing as a self-made person,” she writes. 
It’s a breath of fresh air in the face of decades of science writing 
that insists on the brilliance and self-sufficiency of men, whose 
ideas just apparently popped out of thin air one day. When she 
writes about Johannes Kepler, she acknowledges that yes, he was 
undoubtedly one of the greatest physicists in the world, but consider 
how he had people who supported him — a mother who paid for 
his education, teachers who trained him, a family who sustained 

him. Popova’s thesis — that absolutely every moment, person and 
action is connected — extends from concepts as esoteric as the 
Big Bang and dark matter to ideas as seemingly simple as a young 
scientist’s support network. “The human mind,” Popova writes, 
“seems unwilling to wrap itself and its prosthetic of language 
around the notion of pure impartial probability. We imbue even 
the word chance with a constellation of subjective meanings … as 
serendipity’s accomplice … as free will’s counterpoint.”
Popova’s insistence on connection, on not telling linear stories 
but creating three dimensional spaces for narratives to live in, has 
few artistic precedents. Milan Kundera, maybe, but his tangents 
on philosophy, science and history are crafted more like asides 
rather than interwoven as an integral part of the story. The 
closest counterpart in my eyes isn’t a novelist at all, but actually 
the musician Joanna Newsom. Like Popova, Newsom doesn’t shy 
away from tackling ambitious themes like death and creation, 
writing sprawling narratives that transcend the chosen medium 
(biography and folk songs, respectively).
Newsom’s work, like Popova’s, invites a warm but complicated 
intimacy, pulling an intricate series of seemingly disparate 
narrative threads together to create art that’s demanding, yes, 
but ultimately beautiful. A passage from Newsom’s 2015 single 
“Sapokanikan” could easily serve as a summary thesis of Popova’s 
work: “And the records they left are cryptic at best / Lost in 
obsolescence / The text will not yield, nor x-ray reveal / With any 
fluorescence.”
It’s hard to read words like that and not feel a sense of loss 
over all the art and science and discovery that’s been destroyed 
by popular consensus and history, especially in the context of 
work created by women. A lot of the time, telling one story means 
silencing another. Holding one man up as a genius destroys the 
work and discoveries of all the women he learned from and 
collaborated with. But reading “Figuring” feels like a warm 
affirmation that women have always been there, at every turning 
point of every great discovery and achievement. No matter what 
happens, no matter how constricting the circumstance, the 
curiosity of a 12-year-old girl staring at the sky in wonder will 
never break.
Both Newsom and Popova seem to be asking questions like: 
Who do we remember? Why do we remember? Can we build a 
story out of a forgotten memory? In reading “Figuring,” you get 
the sense that the answer is an emphatic yes, as long as you don’t 
mistake a myth for a history, and as long as you have the time, 
patience and delicate touch needed to dig through the rubble and 
make the text yield. If you dig long enough, and if your mind is 
open enough, Popova argues, you might find a hidden treasure — a 
story everyone thought was lost forever.

BOOK REVIEW

ASIF BECHER
Daily Arts Writer

One of the most common 
descriptors of Mexican rock 
band Café Tacuba’s (stylized 
Tacvba) album Re is that is 
the Spanish-language “White 
Album” of the Latin rock 
movement. The comparison is 
not too far off from the truth. 
Diverse, eclectic with 
a mix of new and more 
traditional 
Mexican 
sounds, 
the 
hour-
long, 20-song album 
is 
a 
self-contained 
epic. Even if it may 
not have reached the 
cultural status of the 
“White Album,” its 
unbridled sense of joy 
and passion gives the 
album a leg up on its 
Liverpudlian cousin. 
Lead singer Rubén 
Albarrán has one of 
those Billy Corgan/
Julian 
Casablancas-
esque 
voices 
that 
have 
no 
business 
sounding that good. 
Squeaky and nasally, 
it’s 
utilized 
quite 
skillfully by Albarrán 
in tracks like “Esa 
Noche,” 
a 
bolero-
influenced 
track 
scorns 
an 
ex-lover 
(“No 
me 
hubieras 
dejado 
esa 
noche, 
porque 
esa 
misma 
noche encontré un 
Nuevo amor”). The 
track features beautiful vocal 
harmonies during the chorus, 
and the smattering of strings 
contributes 
to 
the 
overall 
melancholy.
It’s important to note that 
Café Tacvba’s music is not 
itself a perfect representation 
of traditional Mexican folk, 
but a catchy synthesis of more 
traditional elements with the 
Western rock canon that the 
band 
members 
themselves 
were 
quite 
familiar 
with. 
However, they borrow from 
more than just bands like The 
Beatles. “Trópico de Cáncer” 
has a distinctly Brazilian tinge 
to its chord progressions. “La 
Ingrata” is heavily influenced 

by norteño music, a regional 
Mexican style of music itself 
heavily 
influenced 
by 
the 
music of European immigrants 
from Germany and Poland. 
Simply 
listening 
to 
the 
wide variety of styles of music 
present on Re made me want 
to explore the genres and 
references that are littered 
throughout it, from the form of 
the corrido to ranchera music 

from the rural parts of Mexico. 
Re strikes me as essentially 
a love letter to the music and 
culture of Mexico. Even though 
I have read that several songs 
are in fact parodies of these 
traditional styles, I can tell 
that they are parodies borne of 
love rather than mockery.
My personal favorite on this 
magnificent album is “Las 
Flores” (the flowers). I don’t 
normally 
trust 
ridiculously 
sappy songs. In my admittedly 
stupid way of viewing things, 
they can’t be as aUtHeNtic as 
songs borne out of some kind 
of darkness of some kind of 
emotional pain. But that’s all 
bullshit. I mean, listen to “Las 

Flores.” “Ven y dimes todas 
esas cosas … Escucharé a todos 
tus sueños” (“Come and tell 
me everything … I’ll listen to 
all these dreams”). Ugh. “Yo te 
eschucharé con todo el silencio 
del planeta, y miraré tus ojos, 
como si fuerran los últimos de 
este país” (“I’ll listen to you 
in all the planet’s silence, and 
look at your eyes as if they were 
the last left in this country”). 
God no, stop it. But 
I can’t stop listening 
to it. Maybe it’s so 
damn corny that it 
comes 
full 
circle, 
and the feelings that 
it expresses simply 
can’t be made up in a 
crude pastiche of love 
song lyrics. Maybe 
the words on paper 
don’t convince you. 
Well, just listen to 
Albarrán 
earnestly 
scream at you, with all 
the sunny guitars and 
accordions 
leading 
him on. Personally, I 
hate it and love it too 
much to describe.
Another 
standout 
soon 
after 
“Las 
Flores” is “El baile y 
el salón” (“The Dance 
and the Ballroom”). 
A tender, romantic 
piece about two men 
falling in love on the 
dancefloor, it features 
some of Albarrán’s 
best 
singing 
and 
lyrics: “Yo que era un 
solitario bailando, me 
quede sin hablar, Mientras tu 
me fuiste demonstrando que 
el amor es bailar” (“I was just 
a lonely dancer left speechless, 
while you showed me that love 
is dancing”). The band is even 
more impressive live than in 
the studio, and “El baile y el 
salon”’s live versions are some 
of their best work.
Re is not an album that 
consistently 
reaches 
the 
heights it is capable of reaching, 
but it is tremendously vibrant 
and sunny nonetheless. A love 
letter to the world’s music, 
dancing, Mexico and life itself, 
it is a valuable introduction 
to the world of Latin rock and 
Latin music in general.

Over two decades after its
release, ‘Re’ remains iconic

‘Figuring’

Maria Popova

Pantheon Books

Feb. 5, 2019

Pablo 
Supply. 
Astroworld. 
October’s Very Own. Gucci. 
Louis 
Vuitton. 
The 
21st 
century has made these brands 
synonymous 
in 
terms 
of 
luxury, and the homogeneity 
of the prices reflect this. Social 
pressure is mounting for young 
people to be up to date on the 
latest fads, and specifically 
those generated by artists. This 
is where the artists we 
know and love come 
into play. Kanye West. 
Travis Scott. Drake. 
With prices ranging 
from $100 to $200 
for a hoodie, what is 
driving people to pay 
so much money for 
such a conventional 
item?
If you haven’t heard 
of Astroworld yet, I’m 
going to be honest, 
you’ve probably been 
living under a rock. 
The masterpiece of an 
album by Travis Scott 
made its debut last 
summer 
and, 
since 
then, has captivated 
listeners 
whether 
they’re bobbing their 
heads up and down 
to “Sicko Mode” on 
an elevated surface 
or playing “Yosemite” 
on repeat on their 
way to class. Travis 
Scott has become a household 
name among millenials and 
the popularity of his limited 
merchandise only demonstrates 
this further. The Astroworld 
“Wish 
You 
Were 
Here” 
sweatshirts hit Scott’s website 
for $95 (not including shipping) 
only a few weeks after the 
album went out. Looking at 
the sweatshirt, it is difficult 
to understand why millenials 
are so eager to splurge on 
something that, to be frank, 
isn’t that exciting in its design. 
In fact, if the design had been 
entirely different, the number 
of sales would likely stay the 
same. This is because customers 
are buying the brand and what 
it means rather than the design. 

Sound familiar? This almost 
parallels the marketing behind 
designer brands like Gucci and 
Louis Vuitton.
Now, before someone calls 
me out on diminishing the 
expertise that goes into creating 
designer 
brand 
clothing, 
consider the customers rather 
than 
the 
creators. 
Certain 
individuals are going to buy the 
new Balenciaga shoes whether 
they like them or not. This is 
because the attention they get 
and the impression they give 

off to those who see them wear 
the shoes compensates for the 
price or the look. The same 
can be said for sporting an 
Astroworld hoodie or wearing 
an “I Feel Like Pablo” shirt. For 
many millenials, owning these 
merchandise items creates a 
grey area between who that 
own the boots are actually 
die hard Travis Scott fans or 
merely following a trend. All 
of a sudden, the Travis Scott 
hoodie has become a way to 
prove oneself even though some 
purchasers 
know 
no 
songs 
besides “Sicko Mode.”
The 
importance 
of 
showcasing ones love for “I Feel 
Like Pablo” or Astroworld can 
be seen in the fact that Greek 

life organizations on various 
campuses have adopted their 
branding. Some sororities and 
fraternities 
have 
promoted 
rushing their organization by 
posting Facebook cover photos 
that have their organization 
written in the same font as the 
album. Since these artists and 
the albums in question have 
become so popularized, this is 
an effort to attract audiences 
using something that people 
automatically view as cool, 
likable, and hip. This goes on 
even 
further 
into 
apparel; people can 
essentially 
purchase 
an Astroworld hoodie 
for a marked down 
price that says “Alpha 
Phi” 
instead 
of 
“Astroworld.”
But 
for 
some 
customers 
this 
purchase 
not 
only 
signifies 
to 
those 
around 
them 
that 
they have listened to 
the album thoroughly 
enough to showcase it, 
but also that the artist 
is of great importance 
to them. Even the most 
frugal fans hold these 
artists in such high 
esteem that buying 
their merchandise is 
their way of paying 
their respects while 
also finding a way to 
be close to them. 
Though this may 
seem to contradict my 
earlier point about the parallels 
between 
the 
customers 
of 
designer 
brands 
and 
those 
of popular artists’ merch, it 
only further proves it. Not all 
customers of designer brands 
are swimming in wealth and 
mindlessly making purchases. 
Certain customers have placed 
a great deal of thought into 
their purchase. 
Therefore, the 21st century 
reflects 
this 
transition, 
or 
rather addition, of treating the 
merchandise of artists at the 
same level of designer brands. 
Whether or not customers are 
buying these luxury items to 
gain status or feed their passion, 
let’s be real, the outrageous 
price tag isn’t stopping anyone.

Travis Scott’s ‘Astroworld’:
Album or a luxury brand?

CASSIUS WINSTON LEADS SPARTANS OVER WOLVERINES

The game, and control of 
the Big Ten, teetered as the 
ball found Matt McQuaid. 
Michigan’s defense had lost the 
Spartans’ shooting guard. The 
senior made the Wolverines 
pay.
His jumper from the right 
block found bottom, and 
Michigan State’s lead grew 
to eight. With just under four 
minutes to go in the game, it 
was all the Spartans needed.
When the buzzer sounded, 
No. 10 Michigan State (23-5 
overall, 14-3 Big Ten) walked 
off Crisler Center’s court as the 
first visiting team to win on it 
since last January. And, with a 
77-70 win over No. 7 Michigan 
(24-4, 13-4), the Spartans 
gained sole possession of first 
place in the Big Ten to boot.

After a single handed try at 
a comeback by Jordan Poole 
fell short, with guard Cassius 
Winston hitting six straight 
free throws in the last 40 
seconds, Michigan’s players 
walked back to their bench 
with their heads hung low. 
The buzzer sounded and they 
filed through a handshake line 
replete with disappointment on 
one side, joy on the other.
The game was chippy. The 
game was close. The game 
was everything you’d want 
from a top-10 matchup of 
in-state rivals, living up to its 
billing and then some. And 
the Wolverines, ultimately, 
fell short. When freshman 
forward Ignas Brazdeikis 
arrived in Crisler’s media 
room afterwards, he let out an 
audible groan.
“It definitely hurts,” 
Brazdeikis would go on to say. 
“It felt weird, cause we had the 

lead. We were up six with like 
13 minutes left. And then all of 
the sudden, we’re down and it 
didn’t feel right.”
And, for a brief moment, the 
game was Michigan’s to win.
When McQuaid got called 
for a personal foul early in the 
second half with which he 
disagreed, Michigan State’s 
shooting guard turned to Tom 
Izzo in fury. Brazdeikis, who 
finished with 16 points, turned 
to a sellout crowd and raised 
his hands.
Two minutes later, he drove 
baseline, dunked with two 
hands and let out a yell as 
Michigan’s lead extended to 
six, Izzo called timeout and the 
crowd roared alongside him.
The game, and all that went 
with it, might have tipped 
there. Instead, it turned.
Izzo told his team not to 
panic. He told them to make 
defense and rebounding a 

calling card. He told them they 
had proven they could hang. It 
worked.
“As I tell them, I’m gonna get 
into everybody who doesn’t do 
what they’re supposed to do,” 
Izzo said. “And that’s just the 
way it is.”
The Spartans’ defense 
proceeded to clamp down, 
going over four minutes 
without allowing a point 
as they chipped into the 
lead, retaking it after three 
free throws from McQuaid 
following the under-12 timeout.
As that one-point lead 
became five and minutes 
mounted, the Wolverines’ 
offense kept struggling.
“They’ve been a traditional 
hard-hedge, flat-hedge 
team,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “They didn’t 
do any of that today. And so, 
they’re daring some of our 
guys to shoot. They’re going 

underneath things. It threw us 
off a little bit in our timing.”
In the final 10 minutes, it 
became clear: the Wolverines 
had little answer for 
Winston and no way to score 
consistently.
Junior guard Zavier Simpson 
and Winston both played 40 
minutes and, unlike previous 
iterations, Winston got the 
better of him, scoring 27 with 
eight assists. After redshirt 
junior wing Charles Matthews 
left the game early with 
an ankle injury, Michigan 
struggled to find a consistent 
scorer. 
Simpson had 19 points, 
Brazdeikis 16, but Michigan 
State switched ball-screens 
and forced the Wolverines to 
play 1-on-1. Matthews returned 
by the end of the first half, but 
shot just 1-for-8 from the field, 
creating a hole Michigan was 
unable to fill.

Despite two teams that 
came into Sunday with top-10 
defenses in adjusted efficiency, 
points came fast and easy in the 
early going. When Michigan 
State seemed to gain separation 
after a Kenny Goins 3-pointer 
put it up 27-20, the Wolverines 
jumped out to an 8-0 run of 
their own. At halftime, though, 
the Spartans held a 39-37 lead, 
and the game felt closer than 
that.
That tone continued, but 
on the scoreboard, it was 
Michigan State pulling away.
Standing at the podium 
25 minutes after the game 
ended, Izzo offered up a harsh, 
but true assessment of his 
opponent.
“Michigan didn’t play as 
good as they’ve been playing. 
And some of it was that — we 
had something to do with it — 
but they had something to do 
with it.”

B

elieve it or not, it was 
pretty warm early Sun-
day morning.
Or at least as warm as one 
can expect 
it to be in 
Michigan 
at 4:30 a.m. 
on February 
24th.
That’s 
when I set 
out to Cliff 
Keen Arena, 
where I knew 
students 
would be 
lined up to get one of the 750 
wristbands being handed out 
at 7 a.m. that would grant them 
access to The Maize Rage — the 
courtside portion of the stu-
dent section in Crisler Center 
— for the Michigan basketball 
team’s bout with No. 10 Michi-
gan State.
It was misting, but that 
wasn’t much of a bother con-
sidering the comfortable 
45-degree weather in Ann 
Arbor.
I arrived at the line, which 
already wrapped all the way 
down to Yost Ice Arena, and 
went straight to the front to see 
who had gotten there first.
As it turned out, the first 
students were asleep in a tent.
“Somebody’s allegedly in 
this tent,” said Duncan Tay-
lordean, a senior in the school 
of engineering who was part of 
the second group in line.
Taylordean arrived at 2:30, 
but his friend Arjun Sangwan, 
also an engineering senior, 
got there at 12:30 with some 
friends and saved a spot for 
Taylordean and some others.
Personally, if I were getting 
moving at that hour, I would be 
a bit peeved that I wasn’t first, 
but Sangwan was unperturbed.
“Who cares if you’re five or 
10th, honestly?” Sangwan said.
Added Taylordean: “Hon-
estly, if you’re in the first 500, 
you’re gonna be in The Rage. 

That’s all people wanna be in.”
I was curious as to how 
many people were actually in 
line at that hour, so I decided 
to work my way 
back.
As I left Tay-
lordean and 
Sangwan, one 
of their friends, 
Arjun Ashok, a 
senior micro-
biology major, 
shook his head 
at me.
“Two more 
hours, man,” 
Ashok said.
I started walking south on 
State Street, estimating the 
bodies that I couldn’t see hud-
dled inside tents or under blan-
kets. A group of students asked 
me what number they were, 
and when I told them they were 
around 20th, they were fairly 
excited.
Behind them, there was a 
group of freshmen.
They had trekked down from 
Markley, about a 20-minute 
walk — I know from experience 
(shoutout First Little Hall) — 
and showed up on the corner 
of State and Hoover Streets 
around 1:30.
“We thought we were gonna 
be further back, honestly,” one 
of them told me. “We heard 
some rumors.”
This is the balancing act that 
all the students had to play 
Sunday morning. Nobody was 
quite sure when the line would 
start, only that they knew there 
would eventually be a line and 
that they wanted to be in it.
Tim Kaplan, an LSA senior, 
and his friends live across the 
street from Cliff Keen. They 
had gone out the night before, 
and on their way back home, 
they saw the first tent pitched.
“We thought, ‘Oh, this could 
happen earlier,’ ” Kaplan said.
They proceeded home and 
got whatever shut-eye they 
could — Kaplan says he got 

about 20 minutes — then set 
out around 3:00 with the wood-
en chairs from their kitchen to 
reserve their spots in line.
Even further 
back in line, a 
group of stu-
dents including 
Matt Rose, a 
business senior, 
and Andrew 
Myers, a fresh-
man in LSA, 
stood under 
a couple of 
umbrellas.
“We were 
planning on getting up this 
early, and then he asked in the 
Maize Rage group around 4:30, 
like, ‘Hey, what’s the line look-
ing like?’ Rose said, pointing 
to Myers. “And they were like, 
‘Oh, it’s around here.’ ”

Added Myers: “I sent in the 
group chat, like, ‘Hey, we’ve 
gotta go.’ ”
The characters within the 
line are surpris-
ingly varied.
At least two 
fathers were 
there, accom-
panying their 
daughters in the 
line.
One kid wore 
a Michigan 
State beanie. He 
was visiting his 
friend and didn’t 
even have a ticket to the game, 
but was instead getting a wrist-
band for his friend’s girlfriend. 
Truly commendable chivalry.
The means of staying warm 
varied, too. Most were under 
blankets and in winter coats, 

though some chose less con-
ventional routes. One student, 
who wished to remain anony-
mous, told me that on a scale 
of 1-10, he was 
“10/10 fucked 
up.”
By the time 
I left, around 
5:30, the line 
had wrapped 
into the park-
ing lot by Yost. 
A rough count 
gave me about 
500 students 
that were there 
at that time. I would imagine 
the line kept growing after I 
went home.
What unites them all is more 
to the point.
Each of them chose to wake 
up at an ungodly hour, or 

neglect sleep altogether, to 
wait in the rain and cold to be 
as close as they possibly can to 
the Wolverines’ biggest game 
on Sunday. Every person I 
asked gave the same prediction 
— that Michigan would come 
out on top over their in-state 
rival.
Maybe it’s that kind of com-
mitment that has given the 
Wolverines their home-court 
advantage this season — an 
unblemished 16-0 record at 
Crisler Center.
Even if you believe that has 
nothing to do with Michigan’s 
success in Crisler, try telling 
that to any one of those 500 
kids.

SportsMonday Column: The grind for the Maize Rage

MIKE 
PERSAK

ALEC COHEN/Daily
Members of the Maize Rage waited outside as early as midnight in bad weather on Sunday to get wristbands for the afternoon game against Michigan State.

I sent in the 
group chat, like 
‘Hey, we’ve 
gotta go.’

Second-half miscues doom Michigan

Charles Matthews heaved up 
a shot that clanked off the front 
of the rim. It was Michigan’s 
third straight missed three.
With just over a minute left in 
the game and Michigan State up 
by nine, a contingent of Spartan 
fans began chanting “Go green, 
go white!” as those clad in maize 
and blue began streaming for the 
exits.
It was an about-face from the 
scene just 14 minutes earlier. 
Freshman 
forward 
Ignas 
Brazdeikis got the ball on a fast-
break, drove to the hoop and 
flushed it in right over Michigan 
State’s Kenny Goins, putting 
the Wolverines up by six and 
bringing the crowd to its feet.
But after that, the Spartans 
called timeout. Michigan didn’t 
score for five minutes. And the 
complexion of the game changed 
completely, resulting in a 77-70 
Spartan win.
“We’re just trying to run our 
stuff,” said junior center Jon 
Teske. “We just weren’t getting 
open shots. We weren’t getting 
good looks and like I said, just 
give credit to their defense, they 
did really well.”
Out of the timeout, Michigan 
State’s 
defense 
threw 
the 
Wolverines for a loop. Spartan 
coach Tom Izzo doesn’t usually 
switch ball screens, but on 
Sunday, he did. Michigan State 
forced Michigan into one-on-

one situations, daring someone 
to make a shot.
No one did.
“It’s 
tough 
because 
basketball’s about making those 
shots,” Brazdeikis said. “And we 
didn’t make them today.”
Junior guard Zavier Simpson 
seemingly stopped the bleeding 
with a driving layup that put the 
Wolverines up one with 10:34 
remaining. But for five minutes 
and three seconds, the only 
points Michigan scored came on 
two free throws from redshirt 
junior wing Charles Matthews. 
By then, the Spartans were up 
seven.
“You gotta take good shots,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
John 
Beilein. “And I think our shot 
selection is better than it was 
earlier in the year, but you’ve 
gotta take good shots at that 
time, but when we’re in the one-
on-one situations right now, 
we’ve gotta be more effective 
with it. We have certain habits 
that are not good for some one-
on-one situations.”
Scoring droughts like that are 
nothing new for the Wolverines; 
they happen in almost every 
game. But Michigan State is 
a team well-equipped to take 
advantage of those stretches. 
When 
Michigan 
idled, 
the 
Spartans hit the gas.
The Wolverines tried to get 
the ball to Simpson. He missed 
two threes. They tried to get it 
to Matthews and Brazdeikis. 
They missed, too. They tried to 

get it to Teske, and all they could 
do was watch as his attempted 
layup slid over the basket.
Finally, less than a minute to 
go and the deficit at eight, they 
tried sophomore guard Jordan 
Poole — who shot poorly all game 
and got himself into foul trouble. 
But Poole’s made those shots 
before.
Somehow, Poole swished a 
3-pointer and then another — 
the latter from well beyond the 
arc, an improbable shot that 
sparked hope of an improbable 
comeback.
After an intentional foul, 
Poole got the ball back. But the 
third time wasn’t the charm. 
From there, the Spartans made 
their free throws to make the 
lead 
near 
insurmountable. 
Michigan’s only basket in the last 
30 seconds came on a Simpson 
layup with eight seconds left — 
one Michigan State didn’t even 
bother defending.
“We tried a whole bunch of 
stuff,” Beilein said. “But they just 
had a really good defense today 
and we could not get the leverage 
that we normally can create with 
certain styles of defense.”
The Wolverines lost a mid-
January matchup at Wisconsin 
because they couldn’t make big 
shots down the stretch. That’s an 
easy symptom to diagnose. But 
against the Spartans, Michigan 
— Poole specifically — came up 
clutch in the end.
It was the middle that was the 
problem.

Cassius Winston gets his revenge, 
propels Spartans past Wolverines

Cassius Winston sat in front 
of reporters at the Big Ten 
Tournament last March and 
declared he wanted a rematch 
with Michigan. Earlier that 
season, the Wolverines had gone 
into East Lansing unranked and 
knocked off No. 4 Michigan State, 
while Winston finished with 11 
points and four turnovers.
When Michigan beat Nebraska 
two hours after his comments, 
Winston got his wish. The result, 
though, was the same as it had 
been two months earlier.
The 
Wolverines, 
again, 
displayed 
their 
defensive 
dominance. 
Winston, 
again, 
managed just 11 points, as 
Zavier Simpson — the point 
guard Michigan recruited as its 
contingency plan — shone.
Ahead of the rivalry’s latest 
chapter, Winston was careful to 
avoid providing the Wolverines 
with 
any 
motivating 
soundbites, 
insisting 
that 
last 
year’s 
losses were not 
on 
his 
mind. 
But 
Sunday 
evening, as the 
clock 
ticked 
toward 
zero 
on 
Winston’s 
first 
win 
over 
Michigan as a starter, they were 
impossible to ignore.
“(My teammates) know the 
struggles I’ve had with this team 
before and know how big of a 
game this was for me,” Winston 
said, minutes after securing a 
77-70 win. “And they were there 
for me the whole time. They 
wanted this just as bad as I did. 
We all wanted it really bad, for 
more reasons than just the game 
and it showed.”
And sure, his teammates may 
have wanted the win. But make 
no mistake: This was the Cassius 
Winston show.
It was Winston who wriggled 
around the Wolverines’ defense 
to finish with 27 points and 

eight assists. It was Winston 
who, when Michigan made a 
desperate attempt to claw back 
into the game, iced the win with 
six consecutive free throws. It 
was Winston who was showered 
with “MVP” chants from a vocal 
row of Spartans fans atop section 
214. And, at the end of it all, it 
was Winston who dribbled out 
the clock, mobbed by a flurry of 
teammates when 
that 
elusive 
buzzer 
finally 
sounded.
“We 
were 
just 
screaming 
and stuff, just 
pushing 
him,” 
said 
freshman 
forward Thomas 
Kithier. 
“We 
were 
just 
so 
happy. Especially 
the way Cassius has played. 
He played his heart out and he 
deserves it.”
Lounging 
back 
at 
his 
temporary locker beneath the 
Crisler Center while a horde of TV 
cameras and iPhones crowded 
his face, Winston himself did 
not carry the expressions of a 
man who had just conquered his 
biggest demon.
Even 
while 
remembering 
the celebratory final moments, 
he didn’t crack a smile. His 
comments alternated deflected 
praise with a focus on Indiana, 
Michigan State’s next opponent. 
When asked where this ranks 
among the biggest wins of his 
career, he merely said, “It’s 

up there” and re-emphasized 
the importance of winning a 
conference title.
But beneath it all, there was 
an air of relaxed satisfaction that 
can only come after dumping a 
proverbial monkey off one’s back.
“When it was all said and 
done,” said Spartans coach Tom 
Izzo, “probably the guy who’s 
been scrutinized the most by me 
and you, Cassius Winston, was 
unbelievable.”
There’s a reason that Izzo, 
holder of 10 wins in Ann Arbor, 
called this his biggest ever win 
at the Crisler Center. A loss 
could have been catastrophic for 
his team’s psyche — its fourth 
in a row against Michigan, a 
confirmation that the state’s 
basketball hierarchy had been 
flipped.
Thanks to Winston, those 
worries 
never 
materialized. 
Because 
each 
time 
the 
Wolverines threatened to make 
them reality, he responded in a 
way he was unable to a year ago 
— whether that be with a floater, 
jump shot or perfectly placed 
assist.
“What’s cool for me is it’s been 
a process here,” Izzo said. “… He’s 
had the process, tough freshman 
year, very good sophomore year, 
now he’s having, so far, a great 
junior year.”
And 
sure, 
the 
difference 
between “very good” and “great” 
comes in the form of 6.3 extra 
points and .5 assists per game. 
More importantly, it comes in 
the form of a win over Michigan.

Wolverines fall in East Lansing

Down by seven points with five 
minutes remaining in the fourth 
quarter, Amy Dilk stepped up to 
the foul line. The freshman point 
guard missed both.
Freshman forward Naz Hillmon 
collected the second miss though 
and drew a shooting-foul herself. 
Hillmon, too, couldn’t get either to 
fall.
Missed 
opportunities 
characterized 
the 
Michigan 
women’s basketball team’s (19-10 
overall, 10-6 Big Ten) 74-64 loss to 
Michigan State (18-9, 8-8) Sunday 
afternoon — the Wolverines’ first 
defeat in eight games.
Energized by a late-season clash 
against their in-state rival, the 
Spartans jumped out to a quick 
nine-point lead in the first three 
minutes. Thanks in large part to 
the introductions of Hillmon and 
sophomore forward Kayla Robbins 
though, Michigan seemed to settle 
in. 
The comeback run started 
midway through the first quarter 
when Robbins blocked Victoria 
Gaines’ layup attempt. Playing 
at the top of the full-court press, 
Hillmon then swiped the ball 
from the Michigan State ball-
handler and passed it ahead to 
sophomore guard Deja Church 
for an easy basket. Hillmon — as 
she has done all season — went to 
work inside, securing an offensive 
rebound and powering through the 
Spartan defender for an and-one. 
Two minutes since coming off the 
bench, Robbins and Hillmon had 
helped erase Michigan State’s lead 
entirely.
“I thought we had to settle 
down,” said Michigan coach Kim 
Barnes Arico. “The environment 
and pressure kinda got to us early. 
Once we settled down and started 
pressuring them, I thought that 
really helped us and changed the 
tempo of the game.”
With 
Michigan’s 
miniature 
comeback, the intensity picked up. 
To the chagrin of both sidelines, 
the referees did their best to stay 
out of the contest early. Turnovers, 
on the other hand, occurred in 
bunches and helped establish an 
up-and-down nature to the first 

quarter.
With 
just 
over 
a 
minute 
remaining, senior guard Nicole 
Munger knocked down her second 
3-pointer of the game. Two free 
throws and a layup by the Spartans 
gave them a four-point lead heading 
into the second quarter though.
The second quarter was in 
many ways a mirror image of 
the first. Michigan State quickly 
pushed their lead back out to nine. 
Jenna Allen added to her 10-point 
first quarter with a layup, before 
Mardrekia Cook hit from the 
beyond the arc.
Behind Munger’s hot-hand from 
deep — hitting two more in the 
second quarter — and Hillmon’s 
dominant inside presence, the 
Wolverines clawed their way back 
into it once again. Hillmon’s touch 
and strength were on full-display, 
catching entry passes from all 
angles and with a quick power-
dribble, rising up through contact 
to finish.
And yet, the Spartans remained 
calm. Allen continued to dominate 
inside, 
which 
provided 
her 
teammates with open looks from 
the perimeter. When the second 
quarter had come and gone, 
Michigan faced a five-point deficit.
Michigan State’s freshman point 
guard Nia Clouden catalyzed an 
electric start to the third quarter 
for the Spartans with an and-one 
and a number of crafty assists.
The Wolverines struggled all 
afternoon with rebounding — 
one of their greatest strengths. 
In the third quarter specifically, 
Michigan State accumulated seven 
offensive rebounds.
On top of Michigan’s inability to 

keep the Spartans off the offensive 
boards, its offense was stagnant. 
Going inside to Hillmon — who 
finished with 27 points — was the 
only viable option. As a result, the 
Wolverines struggled to keep up 
and entered the fourth quarter 
trailing by 11.
Michigan gradually whittled 
away at the deficit in the fourth. 
Points almost exclusively came 
from Hillmon and Munger though. 
A deep jumper from Munger on the 
wing cut Michigan State’s lead to 
seven. Two minutes later, Hillmon 
received a pass from freshman 
point guard Amy Dilk and finished 
against Allen.
“(Hillmon) 
was 
incredible,” 
Barnes Arico said. “She was all 
over the place and we did a great 
job of finding her. She almost made 
every shot she took so I wish we 
could’ve found her a bit more. She 
was outstanding again tonight.”
Unfortunately 
for 
the 
Wolverines, 
they 
couldn’t 
manufacture enough offensively 
and the Spartans scored when 
they needed to. After playing solid 
defense the entire possession, 
Michigan allowed Cook to score a 
back-breaking open layup. From 
there, the Spartans sealed the deal 
at the line.
“We got some stops but we 
couldn’t really get many scores,” 
Barnes Arico said. “We turned 
it over when we got stops so we 
weren’t able to make enough of 
those plays.”
Having had to play catch-up all 
afternoon, the Wolverines closed 
in on multiple occasions but could 
never vault themselves into the 
lead in the end.

Michigan trounces Clarion, 37-6

Following 
three 
rounds 
of 
focused 
and 
determined 
wrestling, 
fifth-year 
seniors 
Malik Amine and Alec Pantaleo 
raised their arms to the tune of 
“The Victors” echoing through 
Cliff Keen Arena. It was clear 
they both left everything they 
had on the mat, standing with 
their heads held high as the 
crowd gave them each a loud 
ovation.
The No. 4 Michigan wrestling 
team began its meet with the 
four graduating wrestlers — 
Amine and Pantaleo, as well 
as redshirt juniors Sal Profaci 
and Mike Volyanyuk — being 
honored with their families. 
The former two set the tone for 
a dominant victory over Clarion 
with a pair of convincing wins to 
open senior night.
After 
the 
quartet 
was 
celebrated at the beginning of 
the meet, the Wolverines’ other 
wrestlers followed suit, with 
two freshmen, Mason Parris 
and Jelani Embree, and a slew of 
sophomores and juniors working 
hard to earn key team points. It 
seemed as though the group got 
out of the blocks fast and simply 
never looked back, steamrolling 
its way to a 37-6 win.
“Our seniors, they’ve got great 

discipline, 
great 
leadership, 
great work ethic … they’ve 
contributed 
a 
tremendous 
amount to their teammates, 
and the Michigan wrestling 
program will be forever grateful 
for them,” said Michigan coach 
Sean Bormet.
Given the coach’s praise for 
the senior class, their leadership 
should come as no surprise. The 
Wolverines owe much of their 
success both during the meet 
and throughout the season to 
the seniors’ leadership.
Hopes are high for this trend 
to 
continue 
as 
March, 
an 
all-important 
month 
in 
the 
wrestling season, 
approaches.
“I’d 
say 
the 
biggest 
point 
tonight 
is 
to 
continue to build 
on the excitement 
you 
have 
for 
your 
wrestling, 
for what’s coming in March,” 
Bormet said.
Riding the dominant win, 
confidence is clearly high. For 
Michigan, staying the course 
is the message of choice as 
the team looks forward to the 
upcoming Big Ten and National 
Championships.
The final dual meet of the 

season is a time for the team as 
a whole to look forward to the 
major competitions to come, but 
it also is a time of reflection for 
the seniors.
“It’s just been a long ride, 
man,” Amine said. “It’s just, 
time flies, and I remember when 
I was a freshman on campus, so 
it’s just pretty much cherishing 
it and just being thankful. I 
thanked my parents, you know, 
my coaches, and it’s just been a 
long ride. And obviously it’s not 
over, but your last match at Cliff 
Keen, you kinda blink and it’s all 
over.”
Amine’s 
sentiment 
expresses 
exactly 
how 
grateful 
these 
seniors 
are 
for 
their 
experiences 
as 
Michigan 
wrestlers. 
He 
encapsulated 
the 
nostalgia 
felt by these men, a feeling that 
he, a member of a proud family 
legacy, feels to an intense degree.
“When I look back, when I 
have kids and they grow up, 
having the whole entire legacy 
my grandpa started in the 1960s, 
it’s just a crazy thing to think 
about,” Amine said. “I’m lucky 
to be an Amine.”

Slow start continues in Louisiana

The first couple of games of 
the LSU Invitational saw the 
Michigan softball team plagued 
by the same problems it’s faced 
all season. Towards the end 
of the weekend, though, the 
Wolverines looked revived both 
at the plate and defensively, 
grabbing two wins to salvate a 
2-3 weekend record. 
Friday, the Wolverines (6-8) 
were overwhelmed by Stanford 
(11-2) and No. 9 Louisiana State 
(13-3).
While 
Michigan 
gave 
up 
only one run through the first 
five innings against Stanford, 
trouble came in the bottom of the 
sixth. With the game tied at one, 
sophomore left-hander Meghan 
Beaubien faced six batters in the 
inning, hitting two batters in a 
row and giving up three runs in 
the process before being pulled 
for 
sophomore 
right-hander 
Sarah Schaefer. The latter didn’t 
fare much better, giving up an 
additional three runs before the 
inning ended.
“I didn’t really have the right 
mindset,” Beaubien said. “You 
want to go into that situation 
with a clear head and telling 
yourself to throw your game 
and things are going to work 
out. What you don’t want to do 
is try too hard to get out of the 
situation or get the results you 
wanted. I was trying too hard to 
get the results.”
The Michigan offense couldn’t 
make up the difference in the 7-1 
loss. Friday evening saw much 
of the same from the offense 
against the Tigers, mustering up 
only one hit in a 2-0 loss.
There were some reasons 
for 
optimism, 
though. 
Both 
the infield and outfield played 
consistently 
smart 
defense. 
Senior catcher Katie Alexander 
prevented a runner from stealing 
third in the bottom of the second 
inning, and junior outfielder 
Haley Hoogenraad dove to grab 
a fly ball in center field to end 

the inning. It was these types of 
plays that kept the score low.
In its first few innings against 
Memphis 
(5-8) 
on 
Saturday 
morning, Michigan looked like 
it might face similar problems, 
as the Tigers took a 1-0 lead in 
the top of the second inning. The 
Wolverines responded quickly as 
senior infielders Faith Canfield 
and Alex Sobczak and sophomore 
infielder 
Natalia 
Rodriguez 
all made it across home plate. 
Michigan held onto this lead 
with Rodriguez scoring again 
in the fourth inning, ending it’s 
five-game losing streak with a 
4-2 win.
The Wolverines kept this 
momentum 
going 
against 
California 
State 
University, 
Northridge (4-7). The offense 
proved that strong batting can be 
contagious, getting 10 hits, eight 
of which resulted in runs.
Beaubien 
was 
the 
one 
standout, pitching her fourth 
career no-hitter and her first 
of the season. With the offense 
and 
defense 
finally 
coming 
together for the Wolverines, 
Michigan ended the game with a 
commanding 8-0 win.
The final game of the weekend 
proved to be a solid rematch 
against Louisiana State. The first 
matchup saw weak offensive 
play from the Wolverines, and 
the rematch saw much of the 
same. Michigan pitching carried 
it to a 2-1 loss. For the first three 
innings, it matched the Tigers 
in runners on base, but couldn’t 

finish.
Luckily for the Wolverines, 
freshman 
right-hander 
Alex 
Storako’s pitching kept them 
in the game early on. Storako 
registered four strikeouts in a 
row, shaping the game up to be a 
pitcher’s duel.
“I’ve made some significant 
jumps to just be able to trust 
myself and the process that I’ve 
come to know these past couple 
of months,” Storako said. “Be 
able to be stress free and loose 
and playing the game the way 
that I know how.”
The third inning marked the 
first signs of trouble for Michigan 
as it left two runners stranded on 
base in the top of the inning, and 
allowed LSU a run off of an error 
by Storako at the bottom. With 
runners on second and third, 
Storako recovered the inning, 
saving the Wolverines from an 
even larger deficit.
While junior Madison Uden 
tied up the game with a run 
in the top of the fifth inning, 
Louisiana State quickly regained 
its lead. After walking a batter in 
the bottom of the same inning, 
Beaubien relieved Storako in the 
circle, but she wasn’t there for 
long. Before the inning was over, 
Beaubien allowed one runner to 
steal second base and eventually 
take home, leaving Michigan 
with another loss. Much like 
the first game against Louisiana 
State, Hutchins opted to replace 
Beaubien with Shaefer before she 
was able to finish her first inning.

‘M’ stays unbeaten with sweep

It’s a high-percentage out.
That’s what Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich – and most baseball 
coaches – will say when asked 
about rundown situations. Two 
infielders and one baserunner 
don’t usually add up to a runner 
in scoring position.
But in the top of the eighth 
inning on Saturday, fifth-year 
senior outfielder Miles Lewis 
slipped 
past 
The 
Citadel’s 
infielders to take third base on 
an infield single from junior 
outfielder 
Christian 
Bullock. 
A few pitches later, sophomore 
catcher Joe Donovan sent them 
both home as he knocked a three-
run blast off of Bulldog pitcher 
Jordan Buster.
It was just one of many 
things that went right for the 
17th-ranked 
Wolverines 
(6-0) 
as they swept the Bulldogs (2-4) 
this weekend, winning 2-0 on 
Friday, 9-1 on Saturday and 6-3 
on Sunday. After this weekend, 
Michigan is one of seven teams in 
the top 25 that is still undefeated 
two weeks into the season.
“We’re 
always 
happy 
to 
sweep,” Bakich said. “It’s hard 
to sweep, especially on the road 

against a good Citadel team like 
this that has an older pitching 
staff with speed and some 
weapons in their lineup. We had 
to play well to come out on top.”
Donovan had an especially 
productive 
weekend 
for 
the 
Wolverines. He notched five 
runs batted in over the course of 
the weekend. He also remained 
consistently 
solid 
defensively 
behind the plate, making several 
strong plays off pitches in the 
dirt. Friday, he caught a runner 
trying to steal second, and on 
Sunday, he ended the fifth inning 
by picking off a runner at third 
base.
Michigan’s 
pitching 
staff 
also 
continued 
to 
dominate 
throughout the series. Junior 
left-hander 
Tommy 
Henry 
pitched a complete game of 
one-hit baseball on Friday. He 
faced only the minimum 27 
batters with a career-high of 13 
strikeouts. Saturday, junior right-
hander Karl Kauffman continued 
the trend, striking out nine and 
allowing only three hits over 
eight innings of work.
“What Tommy Henry and Karl 
Kauffmann did from the starting 
pitching standpoint really set 
the tone and gave us every 
opportunity to win the series,” 

Bakich said. “To get those types 
of performances from Tommy 
and Karl certainly sets a tone.”
Junior 
outfielder 
Jordan 
Brewer 
also 
contributed 
to 
Wolverines’ strong performance 
this weekend. On Friday, he stole 
two bases after reaching first on a 
single to center field. On Saturday, 
he had three hits, and on Sunday, 
he saved a run, throwing a 
baserunner out at home plate. 
Brewer has had a productive start 
to his first season at Michigan 
after transferring earlier this year 
from Lincoln Trail Community 
College in Robinson, Ill. So far 
this season, he has a batting 
average of .385 with five hits and 
four stolen bases over the four 
games he’s played (and started) 
in this season.
Before the first pitch on Friday, 
the Wolverines presented the 
Bulldogs with a plaque to honor 
their service to the military, 
as they do with all military 
academies they play.
“It’s a tough group of kids. 
We credit what these kids stand 
for and what they’re all about,” 
Bakich said. “At the end of the 
day, we have a lot of respect for 
them and their patriotism and 
their duty, and for those that do 
serve, we sincerely appreciate it.”

4B — February 25, 2019
SportsMonday
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

If there was any doubt that these 
two teams dislike each other, the 
Michigan hockey team and Ohio 
State put that doubt to rest on 
Saturday night.
It took until the second overtime 
period of the tightly-contested 
slugfest to declare a winner.
When forward Mason Jobst 
took a tripping penalty at the end 
of the first overtime period, it 
appeared as though the Wolverines 
(13-12-7 overall, 9-8-5-2 Big Ten) 
would receive a prime opportunity 
to win on senior night and, more 
importantly, come out of the 
weekend with five points against 
sixth-ranked Ohio State.
But seconds into the second 
overtime period, junior forward 
Will Lockwood took a tripping 
penalty, himself — essentially 
neutralizing the penalty call on 
Jobst. A mental lapse by Michigan 
resulted in a breakaway for Jobst 
when he exited the penalty box. 
He capitalized on the opportunity 
finishing past Mann to give the 
Buckeyes (19-8-5 overall, 12-6-4-3 
Big Ten) the extra point in second 
overtime, 4-3.
“We’re three-on-three, and I 
just think we lost track of what was 
going on,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “We’re pressing to 
score and we’re not maybe in that 
defensive mode. We lose track of 
the time on the clock and the guy 
jumps out behind us and they make 
a good play, he gets that breakaway. 
The wrong player you want on a 
breakaway.”
After last night’s game, Pearson 
assured that his team would 
come out in the first period more 
energized.
And 
through 
the 
opening 
minutes 
on 
Saturday, 
the 
Wolverines 
were 
locked 
in, 
entering 
the 
offensive 
zone 
frequently and creating chances. 
That early offensive momentum 
was halted, though, after a five-
minute penalty on senior forward 
Brendan Warren for kneeing 7:32 
left into the period.
After looking strong on the 
penalty kill through the first four 

minutes, it was Ohio State that 
got on the board with 48 seconds 
remaining on the man advantage. 
Forward Carson Meyer received 
the puck in the slot and fired a wrist 
shot past freshman goaltender 
Strauss Mann’s stick side –– giving 
the Buckeyes a 1-0 lead.
Michigan’s offense picked up 
where it left off after the penalty 
kill.
Just 
three 
minutes 
later, 
junior forward Will Lockwood 
sprinted up the right side of the 
ice with freshman defenseman 
Nick Blankenburg to his left. 
As Lockwood entered into the 
offensive zone, he played the puck 
across to Blankenburg who was 
entering the slot. With defenders 
on his hip, Blankenburg faked 
backhand, pulled the puck back 
forehand and fired past goaltender 
Tommy Nappier to tie the game at 
one.
“I just tried opening up for 
(Lockwood) and then the pass kind 
of was to my feet,” Blankenburg 
said. “It’s nice that he just got it to 
me in the first place and then just 
kind of went to my forehand and 
had a little bit too much speed, so 
I kind of ran into the goalie a bit 
there. Then as he was sliding over, 
his pad lifted up a little bit, so I just 
slid the puck under there and it 
went in.”
The Wolverines entered the 
first 
intermission 
outshooting 
Ohio State, 11-7. Early in the second 
period 
though, 
the 
Buckeyes 
regained 
the 
lead. 
Forward 
Brendon Kearney held the puck at 
the top of the right faceoff dot and 
fired an innocent-looking wrist 
shot. Mann was slow to react on 
his glove-save attempt as the puck 
found the back of the net, 2-1.
Ohio State added one more five 
minutes later on the power play. 
After a strong minute and a half on 
the penalty kill for the Wolverines, 
the Buckeyes finally got set up on 
offense and took advantage quickly 
as forward John Wiitala extended 
the lead to 3-1 eight minutes into 
the period.
“We were good on that major 
until the last, just the last bit of it,” 
Pearson said. “They get that goal 
and then they get another one. Just 

a little bit of a blown coverage on 
it. We were good at times but poor 
at times. We lost the special team 
battle tonight, we lose the game. 
Last night we won it, we win the 
game. That’s how critical it is this 
time of year.”
When play stopped halfway 
through the second period, the 
Wolverines were facing a two-
goal deficit with the momentum 
teetering in favor of Ohio State.
They 
emerged 
from 
the 
stoppage of play on the power 
play. And a minute into the man 
advantage, 
senior 
defenseman 
Joseph Cecconi cut the deficit in 
half to 3-2 on an odd-angled shot 
from the right side of Nappier on 
a feed from junior forward Nick 
Pastujov.
In 
the 
third 
period, 
the 
freshmen continued their senior 
night 
weekend 
heroics. 
After 
recording two goals in the third 
period on Friday, freshman Nolan 
Moyle found the back of the net 
once more for another game-tying 
goal. After having his initial shot 
attempt saved, he collected the 
rebound along the boards behind 
the net. He played the puck back 
into the crease, where it took a 
deflection off a defender’s skate and 
snuck past Nappier to tie the game 
at three with 10:25 remaining.
Tempers flared once more with 
5:55 left. Sophomore forward 
Dakota Raabe was chasing the 

puck along the boards in the 
Wolverines’ offensive zone. He 
took a hit from behind this sent 
him crashing headfirst into the 
boards and temporarily knocked 
the 
sophomore 
unconscious 
as he lay sprawled on the ice. 
Defenseman Tommy Parran —
who delivered the hit — was given 
a game misconduct, the second of 
the game for the Buckeyes. Cecconi 
was called for a two-minute 
roughing minor as he came to the 
defense of his teammate.
The Wolverines were unable to 
capitalize on the ensuing power 
play and went into overtime tied at 
three goals apiece.
With neither team taking the 
edge in the first overtime period, 
each team picked up one point. 
The game continued into a second 
overtime to determine who would 
earn the extra point.
And in the second overtime 
period, Jobst clinched the victory 
for Ohio State when the puck 
found him as he exited the penalty 
box. He finished past Mann on the 
breakaway opportunity to seal the 
game, 4-3.
“Tough points to give up, 
especially when it’s so critical,” 
Pearson said. “But tough play at 
the end, we just have to make sure 
we’re more aware of what’s going 
on there but overall I can’t fault our 
effort, guys worked hard, but we 
just didn’t work smart.”

Right 
after 
Mason 
Jobst’s 
double-overtime 
game-winner 
sailed past Strauss Mann into 
the back of the Michigan net, the 
freshman goaltender knew that he 
could’ve recognized sooner that 
the Ohio State forward was going 
to glide out of the penalty box.
“I have to take responsibility for 
not slamming my stick and trying 
to get our D’s attention,” Mann 
said. “I wasn’t really expecting it 
honestly.”
All it would’ve taken was a 
few knocks on the ice with his 
stick when the penalty clock was 
running down, and one of the 
Wolverines’ defenders would’ve 
gotten into position. At the same 
time though, that responsibility 
doesn’t entirely fall on Mann — 
any of the other three skaters 
could have noted the impending 
situation with the sixth-ranked 
Buckeyes’ leading points man, but 
none of them did.
“I know the other guys feel 
responsibility there too, but we 
just gotta know the clock,” said 
freshman 
defenseman 
Nick 
Blankenburg, who was also on the 
ice. “And we shouldn’t let 26 have 
a breakaway in overtime like that 
in three-on-three, because he’s 
debatably one of their best players, 
so we have to be better on that 

part,”
Playing smart — as Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson noted Saturday 
night and after Tuesday’s penalty-
ridden loss to Notre Dame — is 
something, even this late in the 
year that the Wolverines need to 
do more consistently. In Friday’s 
win, Michigan committed just four 
penalties and killed every single 
one — allowing a total of five shots 
in that span.
And just one second after its 
own power play ended, up 3-2 on 
Ohio State, freshman defenseman 
Jack Summers took advantage 
with a game-sealing slapshot.
“You have to play smarter,” 
Pearson said. “And the power play, 
when we get the opportunity in 
our game we have to do that. We 
did that last night and we didn’t 
tonight.”
Michigan was in prime position 
to take a 4-on-3 advantage headed 
into the second overtime of 
Saturday after Jobst’s tripping 
penalty, but junior forward Will 
Lockwood 
responded 
with 
his own tripping penalty and a 
de-facto ejection two seconds into 
the second extra frame.
Though the Buckeyes were 
the more penalized team for the 
weekend and had two players 
thrown out of Saturday’s game, the 
Wolverines couldn’t capitalize on 
any of their power plays after their 
first goal.
“We can’t get too high when 
we score a goal or if Ohio State 
gets a five-minute, we can’t get 
too excited or get too angry,” 
Blankenburg said. “We’ve just got 
to stay at an even-level and just be 
calm.
“I feel like when we get running 
around or things start to not go our 
way or we just kind of get a little 
out of it a bit, then you can kind of 
tell as a fan or a spectator when we 
start running around a bit or not 
sticking to our game.”
Lockwood’s penalty, if anything, 
wasn’t the backbreaker. Neither 
was not recognizing Jobst’s odd-
man rush out of the penalty box.
Each mistake, be it an emotional 
one, a tactical one or a special team 
one, built up to those lost points 
Saturday.

I

t started as a trickle.
A handful of fans got 
up from their seats and 
headed towards the exits. Cas-
sius Winston 
drained two 
free throws 
to push the 
Spartans’ lead 
to nine. That 
trickle became 
a steady 
stream. Then 
a river.
Jordan 
Poole tried 
to prevent it 
from growing further, hitting a 
pair of deep 3-pointers in the final 
minute. But it wasn’t enough to 
stem the tide of maize flowing out 
of Crisler Center.
And that was that.
Michigan State 77, Michigan 
70.
“Michigan State just had a 
tremendous game plan, and they 
played better than us,” said Mich-
igan coach John Beilein. “ … They 
made us play poorly, and give 
them all the credit in the world.”
Beilein’s postgame presser 
continued in the same vein for 13 
minutes. It was the personifica-
tion of a gut-punch — a party 
brought to a quiet, deflating end.
Early Sunday morning, the line 
to secure seating in the Maize 
Rage started forming about the 
same time most students were 
falling asleep. Saturday, the seats 
that made up the Michigan stu-
dent section had been draped 
with the same t-shirts that rested 
on all of Crisler Center’s 12,707 
seats, ensuring a “Maize Out” for 
Sunday.
It wasn’t just any Maize Out. 
The shirts, which read “Shock 
The World, Boys, Go Blue!”, were 
a reference to Michigan’s 1989 
team, which reunited to celebrate 
the 30th anniversary of the Wol-
verines’ only national champion-
ship. Glen Rice, Sean Higgins, 
Steve Fisher and others shared 
memories, cracked jokes and were 
honored during halftime, soaking 

in the program’s finest achieve-
ment.
The party was about them, but 
other guests were invited. The 
1964 Wolverines, which made 
Michigan’s first-ever Final Four, 
were honored in the first half. 
Later, the 1974 Wolverines — win-
ners of the Big Ten— were hon-
ored as well.
Last, but most importantly, the 
current Wolverines had a game.
Not just any game, mind you. 
Michigan vs. Michigan State. No. 
7 vs. No. 10. Two teams that don’t 
like each other one bit, separated 
by 65 miles but tied atop the Big 
Ten. For one afternoon, every star 
in the college basketball universe 
had somehow come into align-
ment.
It lived up to the hype.
The Spartans were without for-
ward Nick Ward and guard Josh-
ua Langford. The Wolverines had 
a less-than-100 percent Charles 
Matthews, who tweaked his ankle 
in the first half. No matter. The 
opening 20 minutes was left-hook 
after left-hook, the decibels rising 
with every possession.
One dizzying sequence saw 15 
points in 109 seconds. Six baskets 
and three 3-pointers, each hit by a 
different player.

Michigan and Michigan State 
both feasted off the building’s 
energy. For Wolverine freshman 
Ignas Brazdeikis, this took the 
form of rocking Xavier Tillman 
to sleep and nailing a 3-pointer in 
his face, or beating Kenny Goins 
down the baseline and exploding 
for a dunk, pumping up the crowd 
every chance he got. For Spartans 
Goins and Matt McQuaid, this 
meant quieting the crowd by hit-
ting five triples between them.
If you were introducing basket-
ball to someone, you could hardly 
do better than a first half in 
which both teams averaged over 
1.2 points per possession. It was 
20 minutes in which the sport 
seemed to be on steroids.
Neither team had to sustain 
such a torrid pace to win. But all 
parties have to come to an end at 

some point, and the partygoers 
have to sober up in time to go to 
work the next morning.
Michigan State did. Michigan 
didn’t.
From the 15-minute mark until 
Poole’s last gasp, the Wolverines 
scored just nine points. Mean-
while, Winston finished with 
27 points, eight assists and two 
steals.
The Spartans never threw a 
knockout blow. Winston contin-
ued to do his thing, Michigan’s 
shots stopped falling and slowly 
but surely, Michigan State sucked 
the life out of Crisler Center.
“For 30 minutes,” Beilein said, 
“it was a tremendous basketball 
game.”
Now that the party’s over?
The blurry pictures are deleted 
from phones, the hazy, potentially 
embarrassing debauched memo-
ries forced to be forgotten. Braz-
deikis and junior center Jon Teske 

speak with reporters and give 
short, concise, monotone answers 
about what went wrong.
Give the Spartans credit. Their 
defense was great. We just didn’t 
hit shots. We’ll bounce back. We’ll 
learn from this one.
This is what a rivalry game 
looks like on the losing side. The 
rivalry gets stripped away. If 
there’s any extra pain here, it’s not 
on display.
In his two-minute opening 
statement, Beilein doesn’t men-
tion the fact that Michigan and 
Michigan State don’t exactly exist 
on friendly terms. He admits 
the Spartans outplayed his team 
today, the same as if it were any 
other opponent. Furthermore, the 
Big Ten race is still on. As cliche 
as it sounds, anything can indeed 
happen. There’s work left to be 
done.
“There’s so much more to our 
season than beating Michigan 

State,” Beilein said. “I know that 
hurts some of our fans … (but) 
everybody should be very happy 
they went to something like that 
for at least 30 minutes, and of 
course, the Michigan State fans 
for 40.”
Michigan State, of course, 
doesn’t have to go to work just 
yet. The Spartans can sleep in and 
revel just a bit longer.
Tom Izzo is asked if this win, 
under the circumstances, was one 
of his team’s biggest. Michigan 
State’s coach answers affirma-
tively.
“John and I talked before the 
game, this could end up one of 
the best rivalries,” Izzo said. “ … 
There aren’t a lot of places where 
two schools, in state, both ranked 
in the top-10.”
Both teams have had their say. 
Crisler Center, finally, settles.
The former Wolverine greats 
will return home to their post-

basketball lives. Their past glo-
ries, brought back for a day, will 
return to the past.
Cleaning crews pick up trash 
and sweep away debris. They 
leave a yellow foam finger, which, 
for a while, stands alone in Sec-
tion 118. Eventually, that too is 
gone.
The Maize Out is no more. The 
shirts have been taken home by 
those in attendance, and the seats’ 
normal blue color is visible again.
The Maize Rage, too, has dis-
appeared. The seats have been 
pushed to the wall to make way 
for six hoops, three on either side 
of the court, for Michigan’s prac-
tices later this week.
After a supercharged weekend 
of basketball, it’s time to return to 
the office.
