Nation's largest
insolvency case
comes to an end
By NEALABERKOWSKI
Daily Staff Reporter
In July 2013, Detroit offi-
cially became the largest city in
U.S. history to file for Chapter
9 bankruptcy. With the closing
aruments being presented today,
the Daily has summarized some
of its major topics and where they
currently stand.
Pensions of City Workers
Last year, the General Retire-
ment System and the Detroit
Police and Fire Retirement Sys-
tem argued that Detroit was not
eligible for bankruptcy because
any bankruptcy case would
result ina cut to pensions, which
are protected by the Michigan
Constitution. U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Steven Rhodes, who is
overseeing Detroit's bankruptcy,
ruled that pensions were no dif-
ferent than other contracts and

that, not withstanding of the
Michigan Constitution, the city
was eligible to file for chapter
nine bankruptcy. The Federal
Bankruptcy Code allows a city to
file for Chapter 9 bankruptcy if it
followed correct procedures.
After Detroit filed for bank-
ruptcy, the city negotiated the
cuts to pensions. With the grand
bargain, a public-private agree-
ment made between the state,
Detroit Institute of Art donors
and others, funneling more
money toward pensioners and
reducing cuts, the city's retir-
ees voted to approve the plan.
The Detroit Free Press reported
the cost-of-living adjustment
would be eliminated for civilian
pensioners, who also accepted
4.5-percent cuts to their monthly
checks. Police and fire pension-
ers did not accept any cuts to
their monthly checks, but the
COLA was reduced from 2.25
percent to 1 percent.

Four hopefuls field
questions, vie for
two available seats
By ALLANA AKHTAR
Daily StaffReporter
The topics ranged from diver-
sity, divestment from fossil fuels
and the city of Detroit as the four
major-party candidates run-
ning for the University's Board
of Regents addressed audience

members ina public forum.
The Gerald R. Ford School of
Public Policy hosted the event
with The League of Women Vot-
ers of Michigan, as well as the
several student organizations.
Dean of Public Policy Susan Col-
lins introduced the forum and
Susan Smith, president of the
League of Women Voters, mod-
erated the discussion.
"Voting is important and
information is important and a
forum that is truly non-parti-
san, that gives each candidate

an opportunity to share their
perspectives and their views, is
really a service to the communi-
ty," Collins said after the forum.
Candidates began with short
introductions and then had two
minutes to answer numerous
audience-submitted questions,
many of which were somewhat
controversial.
This year's candidates for
the board are Ron Weiser (R),
Dr. Rob Steele (R), a former U.S.
ambassador to Slovakia, Attor-
ney Mike Behm (D) and Regent

Kathy White (D). The board
is currently made up of eight
members - six Democrats and
two Republicans - that serve for
eight-year, unpaid terms.
The two contested seats are
those of White and Julia Dono-
van Darlow (D), who is not run-
ning for reelection.
No independent candidates
appeared at the forum.
Though the candidates noted
their work experiences and
expertise, the introductions of

CAMPUS LIFE
New club hosts
first large-scale
Diwali event

Desi Mania gives
students a chance
to celebrate holiday
away from home
By LINDSEY SCULLEN
For the Daily
The festival of lights reached
all the way to the University
campus this year, uniting stu-
dents for naan, cake and danc-
ing to celebrate Diwali.
Friday, the South Asian cul-
ture group Desi Mania lit up
the Michigan Union's Rogel
Ballroom to throw the first
annual Diwali Bash, an open-to-
everyone celebration of Diwali,
the festival that occurs each
autumn and is considered one of
the most important holidays in
Hinduism.
Dressed in bright colors, stu-
dents ate, danced and celebrated
under the thousands of lights
that lined the ballroom ceiling.

"Diwali is the festival of
lights," said LSA junior Aanchal
Rai, co-president of Desi Mania.
"It's one of the most auspicious
and important holidays in the
Hindu religion."
Business junior Smita Garg,
the other co-president of Desi
Mania, was outfitted in a stud-
ded-pink sari. She agreed with
Rai's description of Diwali.
"It celebrates the light com-
ing into one's life, so prosperity
and well-being for yourself and
your family," Garg said.
Rai and Garg founded Desi
Mania in January after realizing
a new South Asian organization
could serve to bring together
students from across campus
through cultural events. They
wanted to make these events
more accessible to the general
public, not just students associ-
ated with South Asian clubs.
"Only South Asians would
come (to South Asian events),
so we wanted to expose others,"
Rai said.

Tree relocated to
make way for new
business campus
By MAYA KALMAN
Daily StaffReporter
This past weekend, a large
bur oak tree was relocated
as part of the Ross School. of
Business expansion project, a
move that cost $400,000. The
tree was moved to make way

for the new Jeff T. Blau Hall,
which is scheduled for com-
pletion in Summer 2016.
The tree was originally
located in the courtyard
on the north side of the
Ross building, was moved
approximately 500 feet. The
new location is in front of
Ross on a lawn facing Tap-
pan Street. This location was
chosen because it is the only
space near the school that, at
approximately 47 square feet,
is large enough to fit the tree

and its root ball.
Environmental Design,
Inc., a Texas-based company,
conducted the move. Paul
Cox, regional vice president
of Environmental Design,
said chances for the tree's
survival are good.
"It's going to outlive all of
us," Cox said.
Estimates for the age of
the tree vary. However, his-
torical photos indicate that it
is at least 250 years old, Cox

DETROIT
From Page 1A
operated as an independent non-
profit since 1998 and without
municipal support for a number
of years. The value of the DIA's
works of art and other city assets
were appraised in response to
creditors who wanted to know
their value.
After Emergency Manager
Kevyn Orr ordered the appraisal
of the DIA collection in August
2013, advocates for the DIA went
to Michigan Attorney General
Bill Schuette, who determined
that the art is held in "public
trust" and cannot be sold to sat-

isfy creditors. Orr said he had no
particular plan to sell the art and
only needed to know its value as
a part of the restructuring pro-
cess.
The DIA became the center-
piece of the negotiations spear-
headed by U.S. District Judge
Gerald Rosen that resulted in the
grand bargain. Under this agree-
ment, funding from the DIA, the
state as well as nonprofit and
for-profit organizations would
prevent the sale of DIA artwork
and reduce cuts to pensions.
Under this plan, the DIA would
be removed from city ownership
and placed outside the reach of
creditors. -
However, creditors argued
that failure to sell the art unfair-


I I

ly' discriminated against them
compared to the pensioners.
This issue has been resolved,
with major creditors signed on to
deals in which they are compen-
sated in other ways.
The Grand Bargain
The "grand bargain" was
necessary to get the unions and
retirees on board with the city's
bankruptcy plan. Without it,
dividends paid out to unsecured
creditors would have been unat-
tractively low to retirees.
Judge Steven Rhodes, a bank-
ruptcy judge for Michigan's
Eastern District Court, indicated
early in the case that he might
not confirm a plan with direct
draconian cuts to pensions.
Creditors
The city of Detroit owes bil-
lions of dollars to creditors.
Part of the challenge of the plan
of adjustment was . organiz-
ing these creditors into class-
es, specifying how the city is
intends to treat each class and
coming to an agreement about
what they are getting from the
city, such as cash, bonds or noth-
ing at all.
Major creditors such as Syn-
cora and Financial Guaranty
Insurance Co. are no longer
opposed to their plans with the
city. Both Syncora and FGIC
settled for a combination of
cash from bonds and develop-
ment rights. Syncora settled for
$25 million along with credits
to purchase Detroit real estate
while FGIC settled for $74 mil-
lion cash from bonds, also with
real estate credits, the Free
Press reported. Syncora also
received parking facilities and
an extension of their operating
lease on the Detroit-Windsor
tunnel while FGIC received the
site of Joe Louis Arena. Some
small creditors have still not
come up with agreements, but
it is unlikely that they will be
able to stop the confirmation of
Detroit's plan.
Bonds
In 2005, then-Mayor Kwame
Kilpatrick had the city issue
"certificates of participation"
as a mechanism for funding

pensions and getting around
the debt limit, which the city,
had reached. Syncora and FGIC
insured these COPs.
After the city argued that the
COPs were illegal and proposed
giving a low recovery rate to the
investors who bought into them,
FGIC filed a lawsuit against
Detroit's proposal to exit bank-
ruptcy, saying it was illegal dis-
crimination.
There are a variety of bond
types, but every major class has
signed off on what they are set
to receive. Some of them are
receiving new bonds in the same
amount while others are getting
a "haircut" depending on which
class they are in.
Blight Removal
One of the requirements for
confirmation of a plan of adjust-
ment is that it be feasible. Fea-
sibility is generally interpreted
to mean the plan will work to
solve the financial problems of
the debtor. Detroit is saying it
has to use money that previously
went to pensions and creditors
to reinvest in the city in vari-
ous ways, such as blight remov-
al. The city also wants to make
other changes to increase the
quality of life in Detroit, such as
improving lighting and the city's
police and fire departments.
Part of the question of fea-
sibility is whether Detroit has
enough money to do what it
needs in order to solve these
problems and make improve-
ments to attract people to live in
Detroit and pay taxes.
Water Shutoffs
Amidst the issues of water
shutoffs across the city at the end
of the summer, many citizens
and others called for Rhodes
to issue a stop to the shutoffs,
calling them an infringement of
human rights. However, Rhodes
ruled in September that he has
no power over water shutoffs
and cannot force the city to pro-
vide water.
The water authority is shut-
ting off water to homes and
businesses because of outstand-
ing accounts on those locations,
which is what other utilities also
do. Detroit's bankruptcy did not
cause these shutoffs.

REGENTS
From Page 1A
the candidates' platforms dif-
fered little, as all candidates
expressed their desire to make
the University more affordable.
Weiser said the number one
problem facing the University
was the rising cost of tuition and
White mentioned her initiatives
to get more veterans to attend
the University.
Diversity on campus was a
focus of the discussion with a
special emphasis on racial cli-
mate on campus.
Diversity has proved to be
at the forefront of student con-
cerns, as exemplifiedby the Uni-
versity's Black Student Union's
#BBUM Twitter campaign,
created to share the difficulties
many Black students experi-
ence on campus. The campaign
garnered national media atten-
tion and paved the way for the
students to meet with University
administrators to help address
these concerns.
Steele and Weiser said help-
ing lower-income students come
to the University by making the
school more accessible and pro-
viding more grant-based aid.
White offered outreach prob-
lems to encourage qualified high
school students to apply to the
University.
Behm said he believes the
University should work within
the jurisdiction of The Michigan
Civil Rights Initiative, common-
ly referred to as Proposal 2 -
which banned the consideration
of race in admissions decisions,
among other factors - to find
ways to increase racial diver-
sity. He expressed. discontent at
how the Black population in the
state of Michigan is 14 percent
but only 4 percent of the under-
graduate population at the Uni-
versity.
"The picture of the student
body should reflect the state," he
said. "We need to improve that."
The candidates were also
asked about how they would
go about changing the culture

of sexual assault on campus to
make the University safer for
students. The Washington Post
recently ranked the University
second in number of reported
instances of sexual assault.
Behm and Weiser also men-
tioned working with the execu-
tive leadership to find policies
that would contribute to lessen-
ing the stigma surrounding sex-
ual assault on college campuses.
Steele said he would want
robust data on the issue to
inform policy changes and said
he would work with campus
police to encourage survivors to
report their assaults.
Other questions involved
divesting from fossil fuels,
working with the city of Detroit,
growing communication
between students and admin-
istrators, the shared services
center and the recent Athletic
Department controversy.
Behm and Steele were at
opposite ends during the dis-
cussion on fossil fuels, Behm
saying that he will be in full
support of divesting from fos-
sil fuels because climate change
is a fact, while Steele disagreed
with divestment and the science
behind climate change.
"I am a scientist and the data
on this issue is not robust," said
Steele. "It's not a proven theory,
there's just no question about
it."
White said the city of Detroit
is not just important for the
state, but also for the nation as it
has been a leading manufactur-
ing hub for many years. Weiser
added that though working with
the city of Detroit is important,
the University should also strive
to work with other cities within
the state that are also in chal-
lengingsituations.
"Do we tell the citizens and
the people of Pontiac, Flint,
Muskegon and Marquette -
people have been suffering in
the Upper Peninsula for a long
time also - do we tell them that
the University cares more about
the city of Detroit than them?"
Weiser said.

DIWALI
From Page 1A
This is the first University group
to host a Diwali celebration of this
scale, Garg said, offering a chance
for some students to continue tra-
ditions from home and providing
a new cultural experience for oth-
ers.
"This event is a great way to
bring people together, people who
have (celebrated) at home but who
don'tnecessarilyhave aplatformto
do thathere," Gargsaid.
Behind its wide cultural signifi-
cancethe celebrationofand mean-
ing behind Diwali can differ based
on personal ties or family tradi-
tions.
Engineering freshman Ved-
ant Shah, who is from India, said
this was his first time celebrating
Diwali away from his family. He
said it was a rare opportunity to
enjoy cuisine familiar to home.
"Back home, people burst fire-

crackers," Shah said. "The signifi-
cance of this festival is basically
good versus evil. It's a good time
for all Indian friends to wear tra-
ditional clothes, get together and
have a good time."
Engineering graduate student
Deepak Singh also enjoyed attend-
ing the event. He added that his
celebration of Diwali focuses on
Rama, an avatar of the Hindu god
Vishnu who is the source of all
energy and light. Singh said he cel-
ebrates Rama's return home from a
14-year-long period in exile.
"People celebrated by lighting
deepaks, lights, and they lit the
whole hometown with lamps,"
Singh said of his Diwali celebra-
tions at home.
Desi Mania likewise lit the
whole Rogel Ballroom with lamps,
providing a similar feeling for
many students.
"We can feel home here, we can
meet and greet more people," Singh
said. "Once in awhile you need that
kind of thing; these things bond
people together."

TREE
From Page 1A
said. The exact age of the tree
can be tested, but that proce-
dure involves cutting into the
tree and could compromise its
health.
The tree is estimated to
weigh about 675,000 pounds
and is about 65 feet tall. Cox
said the bur oak was the big-
gest he had ever seen.
With the relocation's price
tag set at $400,000, some
members of the University
have called the move into ques-
tion. The move was included in
the overall cost of the business
school renovation.
"It's kind of a tough swal-
low that it's costing $400,000,"
said Engineering alum Jim
Sterken. "But it's preserving
history. The tree was probably
here before campus was, so I
hope it goes well."
"I'm pissed," said Engineer-
ing junior Max Boykin. "It
costs so much money for mov-
ing a tree that could die in a
year or two."
He added that the money
could be better spent on other
resources, research or finan-
cial aid for students who need
it.
However, University
Spokesman Rick Fitzgerald
said he believes the cost is

justified.
"The expansion of the Ross
School of Business is really
important for us to be able to
serve the future needs of our
students," Fitzgerald said.
"But at the same time, I think
we wanted to recognize the
historic significance of the
tree."
For the next three to five
years, the tree will be remain
on a strict maintenance pro-
gram which will include
close monitoring of pH and
moisture levels. In addition,
Environmental Design and
a University horticultural-
ist will monitor leaf size and
color, as leaf health is indica-
tive of overall tree health.
While the tree was offi-
cially moved this weekend,
preparations have been ongo-
ing for months, Cox said. The
process began with a site visit
by Environmental Design
officials to evaluate the
health of tree and the condi-
tions of the new site.
The crew first arrived this
summer to begin the move.
The first step of the moving
process was determining the
size of the root ball; the Ross
tree root ball measured about
40 feet in diameter. Next,
the crew dug trenches about
three and a half feet deep at
the diameter of the root ball.
This allows the crew to "clean
cut" the roots that sprout

from the root ball.
"This allows for new roots
to grow right off those fresh
cuts, so when we come back
and move it, you've got a
tree that's already regenerat-
ing roots before you've done
anything to it in terms of the
actual move," Cox said.
This step of the process is
completed by refilling the
trenches.
The crew returned in July
to begin the second phase
of the move, which includes
building a platform under-
neath the tree using pipes.
The pipes are pushed beneath
the tree, creating a solid grid
that later allowed for lifting.
The final phase of the proj-
ect is the actual relocation of
the tree. The more time that
passes after inserting the
pipes and before starting the
final phase, the more likely
the tree move will be success-
ful, Cox said.
This phase began 10 days
ago, when the crew arrived
and dug underneath the pipe
grid.
The move was scheduled
for noon, yet delays resulted
in the move occurring at 3
p.m. A root mass slowed down
the raising of the tree, a com-
plication that Cox character-
ized as routine and expected.
"Whenever we move big
trees, there's always some-
thing that slows you down.

It's not an exact science," Cox
said.
The tree was moved using a
large transporter, which was
fed under the pipe platform
while a set of inflated air blad-
ders raised the tree momen-
tarily. The process Sunday,
the process that lowered the
tree into its new location was
complicated by the bursting
of one of the air bladders. No
one was hurt and the tree is
secure, and Environmental
Design is investigating the
incident further.
The transporters move
slower than one mile per
hour and were originally
designed to carry large indus-
trial materials, Cox said. The
transporters have 96 indepen-
dently moving wheels, allow-
ing them to turn 90 degrees
on the spot.
In addition, these types of
transporters are ideal for tree
relocation due to their low
center of gravity and large
weight. Each transporter
weighs about 90,000 pounds,
bringing the total weight of
the package to nearly 900,000
pounds as it rolls, Cox said.
However, the tree must
be extremely secure on the
transporters and cannot be
moved in wind conditions
higher than 25 mph. The crew
measured wind speeds on site
approximately every 15 min-
utes during the relocation.

"Actor talks 'Dear
White Peoule' role

ByJAMIE BIRCOLL
Daily Film Editor
"My dad is from here (Detroit)
The last time I was here, I was
like 12, " said actor Marque
Richardson. "He grew up on
Chalmers and Warner? Which I
think is east side."
He might mean Chalmers and
Warren, but it's not a detail which
bogs him down. Richardson is a
man of high energy, and right now,
he could not be more enthusiastic
to discuss his latest project, the
satirical drama "Dear White
People."
The film, which opened at
The Michigan Theater this past
weekend, discusses the plight of
minority students at an exclusive,
fictional Ivy League school.
"When I read the script, I was
attractedtothethree dimensional
aspects of these characters. The
flaws, the complexity, everything
- I loved it!" Richardson said at
a roundtable media interview.
"You don't get a chance too often
to dive into something like that."
Richardson's " filmography
ranges from one-off stints on TV
shows like "ER" and "7th Heaven,"
to more recent, recurring roles
in "True Blood" and "The
Newsroom." But "Dear White
People" might be his biggest, and
* certainly his most complex, role
to date, as the militant activist
Reggie - a "modern day Malcolm
X" as Richardson describes. It's
a role that demands a balance
between sharp comic timing and
dead-eyed seriousness, although
Richardson wasn't entirely sure
how to play it.
"I would listen to Malcolm X
speeches and all this early '80s
and '90s rap and hip hop, Public
Enemy and N.W.A," Richardson
said. "I took it so serious, and
when I saw it for the first time
at Sundance (Film Festival), the
audience is just dying laughing at
certain parts, and I'm like 'Wait, I
was tryingto be serious!'"
"Dear White People" is
certainly a funny film, but it comes
with a bite. Like all good satire, the
film critiques society through a
salvo of mockery, with shell after
shell hammering modern racism,
classism, intolerance and the
overall failure to communicate.
Sometimesit'sdead-on;sometimes
it's a bit tense. Richardson cites
one particular scene where a
group of activists declare "Fuck
Tyler Perry" when discussing the
films being screened at the local
movie theater.
"I read that and I said, 'Oh,
all right. Well here we go,"'
Richardson said. "But (director
Justin Simien) wasn't taking a jab
at Tyler Perry with that line; he
was taking a jab at Hollywood's
thinking people of color, that all

solutions to those problems.
"The goal of those classes is to get
students to that spot where you're
more aware of more issues and
you've had a chance to really start to
engage with them," said Jeff Soren-
son, one of the optimize co-founders.
"Then you get the idea in your head
that 'Hey, maybe I can start doing
something about this."'
But while optiMize is workingto
raise awareness of important issues
through its mini course, the orga-
nization's focus has always been
moving those discussions out of the
classroom and into the real world -
a process achieved largely through
theirannual SocialInnovationChal-
lenge, held throughout the winter
term.
The workshop on Sunday intend-
ed to kick off optiMize's build-up
to the 2015 Social Innovation Chal-
lenge.
In the workshop, ZingTrain
Trainer Timo Anderson and retired
Managing Partner Stas' Kazmier-
ski asked students to write down,
using the presentor past tense, their
visionforthe completedformoftheir
social innovation projects. In Ander-
son's view, having a well-articulated
vision before developing a course of
action is essential for the success of
any project.
"A lot of us spend so much time
thinking about the ideal," Anderson
said. "But unless we know where it
is and have defined and documented
it and made it inspiring and avail-
able, you can't get there. If you don't
put directions in the GPS, the GPS
doesn't work."
The workshop also had a "Vision-
ing" process. Kazmierski said this
was essential for fostering collabo-
ration amongst team members on a
project.
Many of the students at the

event - like LSA sophomore Mary
Kruk, who hopes to disseminate
knowledge of safe sexual practices
to children who receive only absti-
nence-based sex education - were
looking to find waysto puttheir ideas
into practice.
"I have an idea, butI don't neces-
sarily know how to start it or how to
plan it," Kruk said.
OptiMize co-Founder Tim
Pituch, a Rackham student, hoped
that the ZingTrain workshop would
help students begin that planning
process.
"Essentially, what (Zingerman's
is) encouraging you to do is to imag-
ine a better alternative to the prob-
lem, but not necessarily thinking
about the how, not thinking about
what it takes to get there at this
point," Pituch said.
In terms of their on vision for
the future of optiMize, Sorenson
and Pituch plan on building the
organization's disparate programs
- the "Critical Social Issues"
course, the Social Innovation Chal-
lenge and their Summer Fellowship
Program - into a smooth process
aimed at helping its members find
success in their own initiatives.
"The classes feed into that, and
then the studennts that reallr do

well (in the challenge) feed into
the Summer Fellowship Program
that we launched this past sum-
mer where we provide students
with $3000 fellowships to pay for
their living expenses while they're
still working on their project in the
summer," Sorenson said.
But more generally, Sorenson
and Pituch hope to continue devel-
opingoptiMize into an integral and
influential part of the University
community.
"Both of our visions include
actually having a center on cam-
pus - a physical place where social
innovation at the University of
Michigan convenes," Sorenson
said. "Mine had a coffee shop in it,
I don't know if Tim's had a coffee
shop in it."
"It's notabad idea," Pituch added.
"But essentially to have more stu-
dents involved, having gabiggermen-
tor community, alumni around the
world know about us and want to
help."
"I think our vision, in many ways,
is this model of learning and creat-
ing impact while you're learning as
something that's just done around
the world," Sorenson said. "And we
hope to be thought leaders in that

we want to see is Tyler Perry. But
what about the rest ofus who want
to seethese black art-house, smart
films?"
But the film extends beyond
race - it's about belonging,
discovering oneself at college, the
first opportunity one has to forge
his/her individuality. These are
hardships that are universal, and
reveal a heart in the firebrand.
"I'm not just interested in
black stories. What resonated
with me is, this is a story about
identity and identity crisis, and
really giving an eye into a new
level of consciousness, in terms
of (characters) you might identify
with," Richardson said.
Still, there's something
frustrating about the film,
for people of all races; there's
something incendiary about a
title "Dear White People." It's a
strong PR move, gaining the film
fargreater exposurethanatypical
film of this size, with no stars and
a small budget.
"The title's job was to spark
controversy, to get people in the
seats," Richardson said. "Justin
did his job: to start a conversation,
start a controversy andto do it ina
way that hadn't been done before."
The film wisely doesn't provide
any answers to that dialogue,
though, opting to illuminate a
difficult matter and to let the
audience decide where to go next.
"Where do you go with it? It's
whatever the people do, however
you feel about it and what those
conversations lead to in this,
which I don't believe in, 'post
racial America,"' Richardson said.
"We can't give the answers - we
don't have the answers. This film
is a Black experience, it's not the
Black experience."
The hope is all of this leads
to more films like "Dear White
People," ones that are willing

to push buttons to spur the
conversation further, the kind
of films that Spike Lee made in
the late 1980s and early 1990s;
Richardson knows there's talent
out there, and expects indie
black cinema to reappear in the
mainstream.
"This has been going on since
1915 with 'Birth of a Nation,"'
Richardson said. "And since
then there's been and will be a
resurgence, an upsurgence ... is
that even a word? Fuck it; let's
make it a word. We made up a
word today! Upsurgence!"

House Bill 5606 is boxing out innovation and growth in Michigan
n Oct. 21, Gov. Rick Snyder signed House Bill 5606 into

the anti-Tesla bill, strengthens an already existing Michigan
law that prohibits manufacturers from selling cars directly to
consumers. While this legislation is intended to keep the playing
field even, it falls short in practice. Michigan should work
together with businesses such as Tesla and other automakers to
spur innovation and grow the state's economy.

The mythology of diversity

There are two major myths
about diversity on col-
lege campuses, both of
which have sadly
become undis-
puted facts to
most students ,
and members of "'
administration.
The first is that
diversity is pur-
sued for the "edu-
cational benefits BRENSAN
that flow from a
diverse student
body" - a quote
from the U.S. Supreme Court case
Grutter v. Bollinger. In this mind-
set - which, I should note, is the
mindset taken up by U.S. courts -
policies like affirmative action and
recruiting from majority-minority
school districts are about making
the University better. A diverse stu-
dent body will make the campus a
breeding ground for intellectual
exploration and cultural under-
standing, improving education
for everyone.
This is completely logical, and if
handled properly, will achieve its
stated goals. This is not, however,
the only reason for college campus-
es to pursue diversity, nor should it
be the main reason.
Affirmative action and diversity-
conscious programs take their basis
in a series of executive orders and
a 1965 speech by President Lyn-
don Johnson. To Johnson, the civil
rights legislation of the '60s was an
"opening of the gate" for African
Americans; policies like affirmative
action were meant to allow every-
one to get up and walk through that
gate. The pursuit of diversity was
about remedying past harms.
In 1977, this ideology began to
change. That year, the Supreme

Court ruled in Regents of the Uni-
versity of California v. Bakke the use
of racial quotas in college admis-
sions to be unconstitutional, but
left the idea of affirmative action
intact. The use of racial preferences
in the pursuit of a diverse student
body, the divided court argued,
was legally sound - just not in that
form.Bakke would be the precedent
around which all future affirmative
action cases were argued, with an
oversized emphasis on educational
benefits of "diversity."
The second myth, which is built
on Bakke and the ideaof diversity for
diversity's sake, is that affirmative
action is about white people.
This may not seem like a com-
monly held idea on campus, but
that's only because no one says it
so bluntly. We hear it affirmed to.
us any number of ways, from white
students who don't want all-white
classrooms, to administrators dis-
cussing the joys of open dialogues
and understanding other people.
We joke with each other about
how we're such a rich, white kid
school, but put on our serious faces
to bemoan how few poor people of
color we get to interact with.
Diversity on campus isn't about
any of this.
Diversity isn't about improving
universities for their own sake or
giving rich white kids a chance to
talk with Black students who grew
up 10 miles down the road. I'm
not saying these things are bad,
or that they don't help with the
problems we face. It is indisputable
that when privilege gets to know
oppression, privilege tends to take
a step back; meeting and getting
to know students from different
backgrounds has helped immensely
in recognizing my own racism and
sexism. But diversity isn't about me.

Diversity is about justice. It is
about recognizing a failure in our
society and in ourselves and taking
action to reverse it. Building a
diverse college campus has tons
of benefits, but the reason we do
it cannot be so white kids learn
more. Yes, even our justification
for pursuing diversity needs to
be specified.
In Ta-Nehisi Coates' essay "The
Case for Reparations," he makes
the point that simply having a
national airing of grievances can
benefit our pursuit of social and
racial justice. We have to address
problems of racism and inequality
as issues that predominantly harm
those who experience them. Those
with racial blind spots need to
learn their lesson, but our pursuit
of diversity cannot be a campaign
to teach white people how to have
Black friends. Diversity being pur-
sued for its own sake is surely ben-
eficial, but not as beneficial as an
overt crusade for justice.
Whether you agree with this line
of reasoning or not, consider the
following: In 2013, less than 5 per-
cent of Michigan's undergraduate
student body identified as African
American. Even fewer students
identified as Hispanic. In the Ross
School of Business, Blacks and His-
panics made up only 3.7 percent of
undergraduates combined.
With those numbers in mind, *
let me shatter one final myth about
diversity at the University: Wheth-
er the administration's motivation
is racial justice or admissions bro-
chures displaying a human rainbow
- they are not doing everything
they can to build a diverse
studentbody.

LAURA MEYER, ERIKA TSUCHIVA, ELISABETH BENHAM I VIEWPOINT
This November, say yes to Democrats

0

"The Rick Snyder is perfectl" cries
a woman as she tries on a wedding
dress meant to represent Michigan's
current Republican governor. You
read that right - in this campaign ad,
created by the College Republican
National Committee, Rick Snyder
is played by a wedding dress. The
CRNC seems to believe that college
women are incapable of making any
decision that isn't somehow related
to shopping. I'm sorry, but are you
kidding me? Nice try connecting to
college women, CRNC, but when we
go to the voting booth we don't treat it
like a dressing room at a department
store. This ad reflects the sometimes
hilarious and almost always
condescending relationship between
the Republican Party and American
women. No matter how hard the GOP
tries to convince women that they're
the "best fit," they fail to grasp that
women don't pick candidates like
they pick clothing. All the white tulle
and lace in the world can't hide how
Republican policies on reproductive
rights, equal pay and the minimum
wage hurt women. Despite a lack of
frill, women are capable of looking at
Democratic policies and recognizing
that Democrats are making real,
positive change. This election cycle
women need to go to the polls and
tell the GOP loud and clear that
absolutely nothing could make us
say yes to the GOP's antiquated,
offensive policies.
What happens when women don't
get out to the polls in November? In
2010, women, students and people of
color stayed home on Election Day,
and across the country, Republicans
were victorious. What's become
clear in the four years since then
is that the old white men elected
in 2010 really just don't get it. The
disastrous effects of Republican
dominance were felt especially hard
in Michigan when the Abortion
Insurance Opt-Out Act was passed
December 2013 and went into effect
March 2014. The law prohibits all
insurance plans in Michigan from
covering abortions, no matter the
circumstance. If individuals were
to need an abortion procedure,

they would have to buy a separate
add-on to cover it, called a "rider,"
ahead of time. Think about that.
Women are being asked to plan
ahead of time ... for an unplanned
pregnancy. Effectively, people who
buy insurance as individuals are
forced to plan ahead for an abortion,
or risk paying the full price out of
pocket, a cost that can run from
hundreds to thousands of dollars.
This law is commonly known as
the "rape insurance" law because if
someone were to become pregnant
as a result of sexual assault, they
would potentially have to pay for an
expensive abortion procedure out
of pocket. That is, unless they had
planned ahead to be raped.
While Republicans in the state
legislature are passing laws to
restrict access to reproductive
health care, Democratic politicians
at all levels of government are fight-
ing to protect women's rights. In
the race for Michigan's U.S. Senate
seat, Democratic candidate Gary
Peters supports equal pay and easy
access to health care for women.
His Republican opponent, Terri
Lynn Land, voices the antiquated
argument that women "are more
interested in flexibility in a job than
pay" because women lead a "dif-
ferent lifestyle." Even worse, Land
thinks that despite her anti-women
policies she's more pro-women than
Gary Peters, as if being a woman
inherently makes your policies sup-
portive of women. A pro-women
candidate is someone who, like
Gary Peters, has a proven record of
fighting for women's rights.
At the state level is Mark Schauer,
battling Rick Snyder in Michigan's
gubernatorial race. A former
member of the Michigan House and
Senate, Schauer has represented
Michigan in Congress, and he cast
his first vote there in support of
the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.
As governor he will work to repeal
the restrictive abortion rider bill
and fight for equal pay legislation
at the state level. His running mate,
Lisa Brown, is a fierce fighter for
women's reproductive freedom,

and argued against restrictive anti-
choice legislation so passionately,
she was censured for saying the
word 'vagina' on the House floor.
At a local level, Democratic can-
didate Rebekah Warren is ina tight
race for a seat in Michigan's leg-
islature. Warren, who represents
Ann Arbor in Lansing, has served in
Michigan's legislature since 2007,
first as a representative and then
as a senator since 2011. Throughout
her career she has campaigned for
women's issues by sponsoring leg-
islation preventing pay discrimina-
tion and voicing her beliefs in favor
of abortion rights. For her work on
pro-choice issues, she was named
Legislator of the Year in 2009 by the
National Organization of Women
of Michigan.
When Nov. 4 comes, we need to
remember what we are voting for
and whom it is affecting. Michigan
doesn't need the Terri Lynn Lands
of the world making uninformed
decisions that negatively impact
women's lives. Michigan needs
legislators like Gary Peters, Mark
Schauer and Rebekah Warren
fighting tirelessly for the rights of
millions of Michigan women. It's
2014, and it's time for progress.
Four years ago, students and
Democrats stayed home on Election
Day; Michigan's women have
suffered the consequences every day
since. Rather than making progress
toward equal pay and reproductive
freedom, we got the offensive and
restrictive abortion rider bill and a
group of Republican legislators who
couldn't care less about the issues
facing women. When students
don't vote, women lose. Don't let
that happen this Nov. 4. When you
get to the voting booth, remember
that Democrats are fighting
for you.
Go blue, vote blue.

"Get tea-bagged!"
'Wick': A burnout

ByKARSTEN SMOLINSKI
Daily Arts Writer
Every year, big budget action
movies come and go by the
dozen, and only a precious few
deserve to be
remembered. C
"John Wick" is
notone ofthese John Wick
precious few.
It will almost Quality 16
certainly be and Rave
forgotten Summit
among the
dredges of
action movie history, atleastuntil
Hollywood decides to give it a
sequel.
John Wick (Keanu Reaves,
"The Matrix") is an ex-assassin
who just wants to grieve in peace
after an illness takes his wife.
Then the son of a Russian crime
boss steals his car and kills his
dog, who was a final gift from
his late wife. This spurs John
Wick into a killing rampage as
he tears apart the Russian crime,
organization in his search for
vengeance.
Audience members will
probably question the strength

of this motivation. Wouldn't it
make more sense if the writers
just had them kill his wife?
Sure, killing his dog was a dick
move, but does it really seem
like a good reason to murder 50
people? It's problematic because
the film obviously wants viewers
to see John Wick as the victim,
only lashing out in retaliation.
However, his massive body count
makes the scales seem a little
uneven.
John Wick mows through
faceless Russian gangsters like
they're blades of grass on his
lawn. He uses guns, but almost
always at close range. It looks like
kung fu infused with bullets and
feels exciting because he's always
running forward to shoot people
in the head from an inch away.
That said, there's nothing here
that elevates "John Wick" above
the masses.
JohnWickhimselfsuffersfrom
the oldest action movie cliche; he
has absolutely no depth to his
character. His only emotional
attachments get taken from him
15 minutes in, and from there it's
just revenge, revenge, mindless
revenge. Willem Dafoe's ("The

Boondock Saints") character, an
old friend from Wick's hitman
days who accepts a contract on
Wick's life, offers a glimmer of
hope for some internal conflict.
Then his character plays out in
the most predictable manner
possible.
Theonlyreallyintriguingthing
about "John Wick" is the world
it creates. Shady underworld
charactersexchangegold coins as
their main currency. An old man
runs a business cleaning up after
contract killers. A secretive hotel
called the Continental caters to
assassins with 24-hour medical
service and a strictneutralground
policy. Unfortunately, these tasty
side dishes fail to make up for a
bland entree.
Viewers who enjoy action will
love "John Wick." The relentless
rush of stylized action never
allows the audience a moment
to breathe. However, the thin
story and thinner characters
should deter anyone looking for
a semblance of substance. In
the end, John Wick comes off as
just another guy who really likes
killing people and is really good
atit.

What Michigan needs in its new coach

If Michigan football coach
Brady Hoke was going
to keep his job after this
season, he needed to beat Ohio
State and Michigan State.
Now that his last chance is
no longer a reality, you can use
any number of possible clichs
to say this: Brady Hoke will not
have a job at Michigan next
season.
So who will?
The short answer: probably
not the person you want.
There are NFL leaders,
former players, big-school
coaches or rising coordinators
out there, all capable of
leadinga storied program into
something great once again.
But if you want the
Wolverines to succeed, they
may not be in your best interest.
Because what Michigan
needs, more than a name or
talent, is someone who can
take a crumbling program and
build it back up from the very
beginnings.
Michigan needs someone
who could outcoach one of
the Big Ten's best in Mark
Dantonio, instead of leading
a team that looked as if it was
unprepared once again. It
needs someone who can not
only recruit and motivate, but
someone who can put on the
hat, grab the whistle and put
players in the best position to
succeed.
And there are plenty of
candidates capable of doing
that.
But that person doesn't
need to be the big, prodigal
name spurning one prominent
program for another.
It doesn't need to be Jim
Harbaugh - a disciple of Bo
Schembechler. He carries too
much baggage, too much clout
with him. When Schembechler
was hired, he wasn't a

someone who can coach, even if
you haven't heard of the name
and even if that person's biggest
gig is at a MAC school
It needs a guy like Marshall's 6
John Holliday or East
Carolina's Ruffin McNeill, guys
who have taken unknowns and
made them better than when
they entered. It could use a
coach like current Wyoming
coach Craig Bohl, who won
tlhe last three FCS National
Championships with North
Dakota State.
Those aren't big names. But
they are great coaches. They
developedsuccessful programs
at schools when they had nothing
to work with - they recruited
talent, motivated the players and
coached them to be great.
Hoke came from a small
school, but he hadn't found
consistent success like these
candidates have.
The reality Michigan faces
is one in which it has only
its name to lure candidates.
Naturally, coaches like these
haven't faced the pressureof a
job inAnn Arbor, or the boos of
100,000 fans. They just need to
be able to do their job: coach.
If the expectations are for
a big-name savior, it's time to
temper those.
Michigan isn't a great
program suffering through
a slump. It's an average team
with a pair of good years in
the past decade. It could get an
experienced name, or it could
get a popular coordinator if it
really wanted.
But if Michigan is going to
rebuild its program, it needs
someone who can do what the
previous guy didn't: beat Ohio
State and Michigan State.

wrote stories to explain his
background to readers.
It doesn't need to be Les
Miles, LSU's coach, who,
despite years offinishingshort
of an SEC championship, still
has the base for a team to reload
every year. Did you see the
scene in Baton Rouge on TV
during Saturday's game, when
fans roared and rushed the field
as his team won?
Michigan can't offer that to
coaches like Miles, not now at
least. So names like Dan Mullen
or Mike Gundy, who already
have programs they've worked
to build, are unlikely to want to
start all over.

You know Hoke was a
Michigan man, and you know
how that worked out.
The Wolverines don't need
to be limited in their decision
because of ties to the school;
they just need someone who
can coach better than the guy

someone who can bring a

White T-shirts
will be distributed

By ALEJANDRO ZUNIGA
ManagingSports Editor .
Last month, Public Policy
senior Craig Kaplan stood on
the steps of University President
Mark Schlissel's house with a
megaphone to help lead a protest
to fire University Athletic
Director Dave Brandon.
Now, he's bringing his
discontent to the Big House this
Saturday, and he wants other
students to join him.
With the help of a "very

distribute 2,000 custom-made
white T-shirts that read, "We

The goal, Kaplan said, is for

Hesitant Michigan
swept twice on road

No reason to panicfor Wolverines

By SAM LEMI
Daily Sports Wr

MEN
riter

Coming off four consecutive
conference sweeps, the Michigan
women's volleyball team sought
to continue its streak on the road
against two other Big Ten rivals,
No. 7 Penn State and No. 20 Ohio
State.
But the Wolverines found
themselves on the other side of
the result this weekend, as they
were swept by
both the Nittany -
Lions and the
Buckeyes. "ATe
"In some ways,
the success that very
we had over the
last two weeks
created this
expectation that we're where we
need to be - and we're not," said
Michigan coach Mark Rosen.
"We're still very young, and we
still have a lot of things that we
need to get better at in order for
us to be a really competitive, good
team in a conference as strong as
the Big Ten. '
Friday night at Penn State, the
Wolverines struggled to pass the
ball against the defending NCAA
national champions, resulting in
an off-balanced and predictable
offense.
"When you don't pass the
ball well in system, now, all
the sudden, you have only
one option as a setter, so now
everyone in the gym knows
where you're going," Rosen
said. "And a team as physical as
Penn State will put up a great
big block in front of it and set up
their defense around that."
After receiving back-to-back
Big Ten Player of the Week
awards, sophomore Abby Cole
was shut down against both
Penn State and Ohio State,
registering just six and eight
kills, respectively, as both teams
consistently blocked Michigan's

dominant middle hitter.
Freshman defensive
specialist Caroline Knop led the
team in kills in both matches,
registering seven against Penn
State and 13 against Ohio State.
"You want to go after it with
conviction and aggressiveness
and fearlessness, and I think
(Knop) did that really well,"
Rosen said.
But the rest of the Wolverines
were tentative against the high-
caliber,

physical
're still teams they
faced.
young." "I think,
in some
ways, they
care so
much that they don't want to
make mistakes," Rosen said.
"As soon as you play that way -
when you play with that kind of
little hesitation - often that's
the result you end up getting,
is exactly what you're afraid of,
which is an error."
And the hesitation showed as
Michigan committed a costly 17
errors against Penn State and 21
against Ohio State.
"The tough thing with us
right now is that we're so thin,"
Rosen said. "We don't have a lot
of adjustments as far as depth in
each position."
But Michigan wasn't without
bright spots, as Lindsey Lerg
registered 13 digs against Ohio
State to add to Knop's 13 kills.
The remainder of Michigan's
schedule includes other high-
caliber opponents that will
continue to challenge Michigan.
"We've got to embrace the fact
that we're going to have to
come out and learn how to be
aggressive against those teams,
learn how to be fearless against
those teams and learn how to
execute at a higher level," Rosen
said. "And pretty quickly, too."

BOSTON - At the 11:43
mark in the third period
against No.11 Boston
University, Michigan huddled
alongthe boards around Dexter
Dancs. The forward had just
redirected a tie-breaking goal,
the score the Wolverines needed

goals and one of Michigan's.
All three Terrier goals were
confirmed. The lone Wolverine
goal was overturned.
"It's disappointing when the
outcome of the game comes
down to the referees sitting in
the penalty box looking at a
monitor to decide whether the
goals were in," Berenson said.
"I don't know how we ever
played hockey without having
to review. We feel victimized by
the review system."
Well before anytype of
video review existed, Berenson
donned the block 'M' when
he played his senior year
at Michigan in 1962. His
experience with hockey since
then is where his frustration
stems from.
Perhaps 52 years ago, Dancs'
redirect is the go-ahead goal
Michigan needs to complete
a resume-building weekend,
complete with two dominant
wins over ranked opponents.

Instead, Michigan sits at 2-3
with a tricky road series against
Michigan Tech next weekend .
- a team that just swept Ferris
State on the road. For those with
a short memory, the Wolverines
opened their season at Ferris
State and came out on the short
end.
But Berenson has been
around hockey long enough to
know when a team should panic.
He knows that's not now. He ,
knows his team could've beaten
Boston and knows there were far
more positives than negatives on
Saturday, despite the loss.
The Wolverines entered
Saturday knowing the Terriers
boasted 17-year-old freshman
phenom Jack Eichel, a sure-fire,
top-five pick in the 2015 NHL
Draft that had five points in his
first two games.
The result: Michigan held
Eichel largely in check -
limitingthe forward to one
point - thanks to an impressive
backcheck.
"Jack Eichel, for all he is, and
he is a greatplayer, he didn't
really do much," said junior
forward Andrew Copp. "He
had that one tip-in goal from
the corner ... thatckind of weird
bounce goal."
He's right: Eichel's goal did
take a weird bounce. Eichel,
though, was far-and-away the
most electric player on the ice.
And after strugglingto block
shots against New Hampshire,
Berenson stressed all week the
importance of it. So the orange
balls, softer than pucks, were
brought out at practice.
The result: Berenson thought
his team may have blocked too
many shots and needs to take it
down a notch.
"I think we improved a ton
in shot blocking," Berenson
said. "You don'twanttoblock
too many. That means you're in
your own zone too much. We're
paying the price to get in front of
the puck now."
The coach voiced his concern
with his power play. The

Wolverines entered the weekend
0-for-9 with a man advantage
and allowed two shorthanded
goals. So they made special
teams an emphasis in practice
all week.
The result: Michigan flew
back to Ann Arbor after scoring
three power-play goals-and
allowing no shorthanded goals.
The Wolverines looked
drastically better compared to
the team that showed up to lose
5-1 to New Hampshire just more
than a week ago. Remember
that?
More so, Berenson has found a
pot of gold with his second line:
freshman center Dylan Larkin,
senior forward Zach Hyman and
sophomore forward Alex Kile.
The trio registered 15 points -
six goals and nine assists - this
weekend. And 12 of those came
against No.7 UMass-Lowell.
Good things happen when this
line touches the ice.
"We've been together for a
month and a half now," Kile said.
"I said this before, we're great
friends off the ice. We talk about

how we can contribute each and
every night. Right now, we're
clicking, and we're hoping that
continues."
So far, there are no signs
pointing to the line's success
slowing down. The second line
has been so dominant that it's
easy to forget about the other
talent on the team, primarily
Copp and sophomore forward JT
Compher.
Copp and Compher are
scoreless through five games, but
its reassuring knowing they don't
have to carry the offense solely
on their shoulders this season.
"We can beat any team in the
country and Ithink we showed
that tonight," Copp said. "We're
a better team."
Exactly. So what's worth
panicking about, even after a
loss that a questionable review
decided?
Nothing. And Michigan
knows that.

'M' gets Senior Day victory

Michigan clinches
third in conference

As play transitioned back

the final buzzer, Pankratz stayed
on the field in an animated
discussion with both officials.
While the green card didn't

the exchange was indicative of
the stress of the game. Despite
handily outshooting New
Hampshire, the Wolverines (5-2
Big Ten, 11-6 overall) could never
put the game away, hanging on to
win, 3-2, over the opportunistic
Wildcats on Senior Day.
Early in the second half, it
looked as if the Wolverines
were set to cruise to another
victory at Ocker Field. Leading
by two goals, a shot off a corner
from freshman midfielder Katie
Trombetta found the inside of
the far post and banked in, which
would give them a comfortable
4-1 lead.
However, the celebration
abruptly ended when a referee
blew his whistle and signaled a
Michigan foul before the shot,
denying the goal and keeping
the game within reach for New
Hampshire (6-11).
The disallowed goal was
one of many opportunities
missed by the Wolverines,
who uncharacteristically
struggled both offensively and
defensively on corners. The two
New Hampshire goals came off
corners, while Michigan failed
to score on its eight chances.
"On faster fields, our corners

said. "(New Hampshire

As freshman forward Taylor
Timko was setting up to take
a free kick, the future of the
Michigan women's soccer team's
season was on the line.
With the game tied, the
Wolverines couldn't afford going
a fourth straight game without a
win.
Timko ILLINOIS 1
delivered MICHIGAN 2
a perfect
ball into the attacking area,
where freshman forward Nicky
Waldeck was there to head
it toward the net. Waldeck's
shot was saved, but sophomore
midfielder Jessica Heifetz was
there to finish the job with a
winning goal. And just like that,
Michigan was ahead of Illinois,
2-1- a lead it never relinquished.
With the win, the Wolverines
clinched third place in the Big
Ten regular-season standings
and boosted their NCAA
Tournament resume.
It was a competitive game for
all 90 minutes, but it was the
Fighting Illini (5-6-1 Big Ten,
10-7-1 overall) who dominated
the opening portion of the match
after scoring a quick goal.
But the Wolverines were

equally as quick to respond. Less
than two minutes later, freshman
Ani Sarkisian served a corner
kick to Timko, who knocked the
ball past the Illinois goalkeeper.
The pace and possession of the
match were even until Heifetz's
goal in the 60th minute. For the
final minutes of the game, Illinois
peppered Michigan's defense,
but the Wolverines held strong.
Although the Illini outshot
Michigan, they did not have
any chances

All of their have

The end of this
the game was
a big test for -

colors.
Heifetz was impressed by
her team's strength in the final
minutes.
"Late in the season, when
everyone's really tired - it just
comes down to who is going to
work the hardest," Heifetz said.
"We outworked them."
Michigan coach Greg Ryan

was equally as excited by his
team's gritty effort.
"We just keep fighting the
same way every day," Ryan said.
"Finding ways to win - that's
what good teams do."
With just one game to go
before the Big Ten Tournament,
Ryan took the chance to reflect
on his team's season as a whole
and just how farthey have come.
"We should have never been
this good this year," Ryan said.
"I haven't seen

It's wins like this one -

- that define a team, and
Michigan looks primed for a
postseason run.

outstanding, she made a lot
of great saves. On defense, we
had to throw someone in there
because (senior midfielder
Sammy Gray) was taken out at
the last minute, but we'll make
adjustments in the future."
Despite its struggles on
corners, Michigan largely
controlled the flow of the game,
particularly in the second half.
The senior class accounted for
all three Wolverine goals, with
midfielder Ainsley McCallister
netting two in a span of four
minutes and forward Emy
Guttman scoring one as well.
"(Our seniors) are a great
group," Pankratz said. "I've been
proud of them all four or five
years. Ainsley is an outstanding
player and sois (senior midfielder
Leslie Smith), and they carried
our team."
While they controlled
the second half, it took the
Wolverines most of the first half
to solidly establish their lead. As
the first-half clock ticked down,
McCallister showed why she
is Michigan's second-leading
scorer, picking up a loose ball

off the stick of junior forward
Shannon Scavelli and rifling a
shot into the back of the net.
Minutes later, during a flurry
just to the left of the Wildcat
net, McCallister managed to
get a stick on an airborne ball
and loft it just over both a New
Hampshire player and the
goaltender to give Michigan a
two-goal lead.
Despite McCallister's
efforts, New Hampshire added
some late drama to the game.
Down one, the Wildcats were
desperate to score in the closing
minutes, earning back-to-back
penalty corners with three
minutes remaining. But both
were cleared before reaching
freshman goaltender Sam
Swenson.
With 53 seconds left on the
clock, a yellow card was given
to McCallister, forcing the
dominant midfielder off the field
and drawing ire from Pankratz.
However, the Wildcats couldn't
get a shot on goal and Michigan
was able to breathe a sigh of
relief. Then, the Wolverines
could properly celebrate their
Senior Day.


HOKE'S FANS

increased with each
Michigan mistake on the field.
"I see a coach out there who
tries really hard, but at the end
of the day he has absolutely
nothing to show for it. I mean,
at least he cares about his
players, right?" TeBos said
with a straight face before
erupting into a fit of laughter,
referencing Michigan's
mistreatment of Shane Morris'
concussion earlier this season.

It was a miserable day
for Hoke. He was angry
with himself for failing to
adequately prepare his team
for its rivals over a timespan
of two weeks. Hoke was upset
his team once again failed to
execute, even after saying all
week that he liked what he saw
in practice.
Hoke's team is 3-5 after
Saturday, and the rest of the
season will feel like a slow,
merciless march toward
irrelevance. Back in Ann
Arbor, people call for his head
increasingly with each loss.

Whenever he's asked about
his job status, Hoke says he
doesn't think about it. He just
cares about his 115 student-
athletes.
But in East Lansing, the
students care about Hoke.
Whenever he's despondent or
worried about his job status,
he can drive northwest, to the
place where he's love'i.
They'll have plenty of hugs
and cookies waiting for him.

Because Michigan struggles
on the ground and fifth-year
senior quarterback Devin
Gardner struggles with
accuracy, Funchess needs to
be the dependable player on
this offense. When he isn't, the
offense has no one else to turn
to.
4. The routine with the media
won't change this season
The patterns have existed
since Michigan's loss to Notre
Dame in the second week of
the season. Each week, the
Wolverines supposedly have
a great week of practice and
claim the team is working hard
and sticking together. Then the
team fails to eecute Saturday.
Drastic change is unlikely at
any point during this season.
Michigan coach Brady Hoke
will persist in saying his team
is working hard and competing
well enough to win in practice.
Gardner will remain the team's
quarterback the rest of this
season, fighting to evade the
pass rush that comes with a
porous offensive line.
It has become a pattern of
dread for Michigan fans, the
feeling that little good can come
each Saturday no matter what is
said during the week.
5. Bold prediction: The
Penn State win will be the
highlight of the season
Michigan's win over the
Nittany Lions before the
bye week is the team's only
Big Ten win to date. It had
the atmosphere that comes
with a night game and an
involved home crowd, and the
Wolverines' effort in the game
matched the environment.
It appears unlikely the
team will experience success
of that magnitude again. Few
of Michigan's struggles have
disappeared during the course
of the season. The problems that
existed in the Wolverines' loss
to Notre Dame in the second
week of this season remain.
It would take an enormous
upset at Ohio State to top the
Penn State victory. A win in that
game would take a dramatic
reversal of fortune, one that
doesn't seem to be around the
corner.
You've already seen the best
of this team, and it wasn't even
all that great.

Michigan's offense struggled all Saturday afternoon. It was outgained by Michigan State running back Jeremy Langford.

competence from Michigan's
offense. They have come when

danger, making circus catches
like he did with his early
touchdown catch against Penn

hands of a defender.
But Funchess struggled to
make those -catches, failing
to come away with relatively
easy targets at times Saturday.

offenses, the Wolverines need
