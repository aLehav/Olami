Three students have been 

awarded 
the 
prestigious 

Marshall 
and 
Schwarzman 

scholarships 
to 
pursue 

graduate studies at universities 
in the United Kingdom and 
China during the upcoming 
academic year.

LSA 
seniors 
Amanda 

Burcroff and Noah McNeal 
won the Marshall Scholarship, 
which 
provides 
up 
to 
50 

students from across the United 
States full funding to study at 
any U.K. institution in any field 
of choice. Business and LSA 
senior Eduardo Batista became 
the first University of Michigan 

student to win the Schwarzman 
Scholarship, 
which 
was 

created in 2016. According to 
the website, the Schwarzman 
Scholarship 
offers 
students 

interested in global affairs 
the chance to study at China’s 
Tsinghua University.

Burcroff 
and 
McNeal 

became the University’s 8th 
and 9th Marshall Scholarship 
winners, and are the first 
winners since 2013. A press 
release 
published 
Monday 

afternoon by the Marshall 
Scholarship 
Program 
said 

the 48 scholars were chosen 
from a pool of over 1,000 
applicants. The winners will 
join an accomplished alumni 
base including Supreme Court 

Bird –– the scooter-sharing 

company that took Ann Arbor 
and the University of Michigan’s 
campus by storm this fall –– 
says it will continue to operate 
during the winter, depending 
on daily weather conditions.

A 
Bird 
spokesperson 

confirmed 
the 
company’s 

intentions to let the public 
proceed with riding through 
the winter months, but added 
that the vehicles could be 
removed if inclement weather 
were to occur.

“Bird is extremely committed 

to the safety of our riders, and 
so we take into account the 
weather conditions of each city 
where Bird is available,” a Bird 
spokesperson wrote in an email 
to The Daily.

The spokesperson said Bird 

has a monitoring team that 
reviews riding conditions and 
determines 
whether 
roads 

are safe for use each day, and 
oftentimes the service will 
pause riding when weather is 
not permitting, such as during 
storms or hurricanes. When 
there’s a threat of blizzards 
or icy roads, the company 
investigates to deem whether 
the driving environment is safe. 
Bird’s statement still leaves 
uncertainty 
as 
to 
whether 

the Bird scooters will, in fact, 
completely migrate south for 
the winter.

Scooter 
usage 
has 
been 

hotly contested ever since they 
arrived in Ann Arbor this past 
September. After the scooters’ 
initial deployment, the city of 
Ann Arbor temporarily removed 
nearly two dozen scooters for 
violating city ordinances that 
require motorized vehicles not 
to interfere with the public 
right-of-way. 
According 
to 

Lisa 
Wondrash, 
the 
city’s 

communications director, Ann 
Arbor has had many Bird-

related violations, but only 
one has been reported and 
confirmed to have resulted 
in an injury attributable to a 
Bird scooter. Since the initial 
crackdown, 
a 
total 
of 
44 

scooters have been impounded.

Backlash 
from 
the 
local 

government’s decision to seize 
the scooters led to an agreement 
passed in November with Bird 
Rides, Inc. that requires the 
company to pay a fee to the 

city of Ann Arbor, provide 
educational materials to its 
users and assume liability for 
improper driving or parking of 
the vehicles.

“The 
City 
Council 
has 

provided their policy direction 
regarding Bird and scooter 
share companies, which is 
that we should allow them to 
operate insofar as they can be 
operated safely and they can 

A new study on the use of

Tuesday 

night to introduce and discuss

“The NET plan is a narrative,

Lyons said. “This program was 
created to fulfill the needs

add value in terms of providing 
an alternative and in-demand 
transportation option for Ann 
Arbor,” Wondrash said.

With the passage of the 

resolution, 
scooters 
are 
to 

be 
parked 
responsibly 
on 

sidewalks when not in use, 
not directly in the walking 
path or in any way impeding 

a pedestrian’s access. Though 
the resolution with Bird could 
potentially 
limit 
students’ 

abilities to ride more frequently, 
some students, like LSA junior 
Yosef Gross, agree with the 
measures.

“I 
think 
that 
making 

the operator take financial 
responsibility for inappropriate 
use of scooters is sensible 
because it will incentivize them 
to educate and encourage riders 
to use them properly,” Gross 

wrote in an email interview.

While Bird scooters are 

still allowed on campus, the 
University has also intervened 
to discipline scooter-related 
violations. Melissa Overton, 
deputy chief of police at the 
University of Michigan Police 
Department, 
said 
UMPD 

has issued two Bird-related 
violations: one for being parked 
inside a building, and one for 
being involved in an accident.

Bird scooters have taken on 

a cult following among 
University 
students, 

who 
use 
the 
vehicles 

to 
move 
throughout 

Michigan’s vast campus. 
The convenience of the 
scooters is what most 
attracts student riders.

“A 10-minute walk to 

class only takes me four 
minutes when I scooter,” 
Gross wrote.

As 
temperatures 

continue 
to 
plummet 

and inclement weather 
begins to arrive in Ann 
Arbor during the winter 
months, 
city 
officials 

are concerned with the 
potential safety hazards 
that could come with 
riding scooters on icy 
roads or other slippery 
surfaces.

“Bird riders will have 

to be careful in the winter, 
and make sure that the 
roads and sidewalks are 
clear of snow and ice 
before they attempt to ride 
on them,” Wondrash said. 
“Bird has said that they 
will monitor snow and 

ice to determine deployment 
levels of scooters, and the city 
also has the authority to order 
the scooters off the streets if 
weather makes their operation 
impractical, according to the 
licensing agreement.”

Gross, however, wrote he’s 

“not 
too 
concerned 
about 

scootering in the winter.”

“If there is a significant 

amount of snow or ice on the 
ground, I won’t ride one,” Gross 
wrote. “Otherwise, I trust my 
scootering skills that I’ve honed 
ever since I rode my first razor 
scooter in elementary school.”

Just as Bird has stated, 

there 
are 
still 
common 

sense situations that would 
cause for scooter usage to 
be suspended. In the event 
of a major snowstorm or icy 
road conditions, the service 
assigns employees to remove 
the scooters from the city in 
which they are operated. Such 
conditions are understandably 
unnavigable 
to 
the 
public 

and have led some to accept 
removal of the vehicles.

“I think scooters should 

be shut down on days with 
particularly 
bad 
weather 

conditions, like when there is 
a lot of ice or snow. Otherwise, 
I think that they should still be 
allowed in the winter,” Gross 
wrote. “I actually think that 
they could be more convenient 
in the winter because they 
will minimize the time that 
riders have to spend outside in 
the cold and maybe lead riders 
to go to places they wouldn’t 
otherwise walk to in the cold.”

ON THE DAILY: BEAVER TRAP, SMOKE’S POUTINERIE CLOSE

THIS WEEK IN HISTORY: A2 GAY COUPLES PRAISE HAWAII MARRIAGE RULING

Smoke’s Poutinerie, a poutine 

restaurant in Ann Arbor, and The 
Beaver Trap, its connected bar, 
both ended service in November. 
No reason for closure was 
provided by the owner. 

Within 18 months of opening, 

the first Michigan installation of 
the Smoke’s franchise closed.

Smoke’s has become a staple 

of fast food dining in Canada 
ever since its opening in Toronto 
in 2009. The poutine franchise 
now has more than 200 locations 
in Canada. After successfully 
growing 
its 
business 
across 

Canada in college towns and 
major cities alike, Smoke’s sought 
to expand the reach of its brand 
by opening franchises in the 
United States. Its first location in 
the U.S. opened in Berkeley, Calif. 
during winter 2014. The launch 
of its first Michigan restaurant 
in Ann Arbor followed in spring 
2017, as Smoke’s hoped to expand 
into the Midwest.

The Beaver Trap bar was 

made an extension to the Ann 
Arbor Smoke’s franchise in hopes 
of attracting students.

Smoke’s 
and 
The 
Beaver 

Trap’s did not seem to widely 
capture the attention of college 
students that frequented Ann 
Arbor’s bar scene. Many times 
the bar was empty compared to 
others in town.

“What 
drew 
me 
to 
the 

restaurant was that it was never 
crowded, the drinks were cheap 
and well made and there was 
great 
service,” 
Information 

senior Emma Welch said.

“I think Beaver Trap failed 

to stay open because it is hard 
to compete with the well-
established 
student 
bars 
on 

South U, like Brown Jug, Blue 
Leprechaun and Good Time 
Charley’s.” 

Welch said many patrons did 

not seem to connect with the 
dining options from Smoke’s.

“The food was the one thing 

that was lacking,” Welch said. 
“They only had poutine which 
my friends and I did not enjoy. 
Other bars had good food and I 
think this is what caused Beaver 
Trap to never get as popular as it 
could have.”

Smoke’s 
Poutinerie 
staff 

declined requests for comment.

December 5, 1996
After years of being unable 

to marry, Ronni Sanlo and 
Kathy Lindblad may soon be 
able to realize their dream of a 
same-sex marriage, following 
Tuesday’s historic decision in 
Hawaii.

Hawaii Circuit Court Judge 

Kevin Chang said the Hawaiian 
state government had failed 
to establish a compelling state 
interest to justify prohibiting 
same-sex marriages.

Yesterday, 
Chang 
granted 

a stay, putting the ruling on 
hold for at least a year, while 
the state appeals to Hawaii’s 
Supreme Court.

Sanlo, 
director 
of 
the 

University’s Lesbian, Gay and 

Bisexual Programs Office, said 
she anticipated the decision 
with caution.

“I had anticipated Judge 

Chang’s decision to be in favor 
of the marriages. When I heard 
the decision I felt overly joyed 
but was cautious because of 
the appeal process that will 
probably take place for at least 
another month,” she said.

Sanlo asserted that Chang’s 

decision will not be overruled.

“I strongly feel that decision 

will hold up. There will be 
opposition 
in 
other 
states 

who passed laws recently, like 
Michigan, but they will most 
likely be ruled unconstitutional. 
With that in mind, I decided to 
ask my partner to got to Hawaii 

to get married. Hopefully it 
will happen very soon.”

Sanlo 
stressed 
the 

importance of being recognized 
in society as being married for 
legal and personal issues.

“It’s a little scary thinking 

about 
what 
could 
happen 

without being recognized to 
be married. If I died tomorrow, 
my partner has no legal right to 
claim the children that we have 
raised together. We also are 
forced to pay higher taxes that 
married couples are exempt 
from. That simply isn’t fair,” 
she said.

“It’s 
very 
important 
we 

have 
children, 
we 
have 

grandchildren 
that 
includes 

us as part of the family. There 

is no way to legitimize our 
relationship. For this law to 
pass — it gives us hope to finally 
have the opportunity to have 
a recognized commitment in 
society.”

Ryan LaLonde, a member 

of Queer Unity Project, said 
he couldn’t believe Chang’s 
decision.

“I was a little sceptical about 

the idea of same-sex marriages 
ever 
occurring 
during 
my 

lifetime. I had the idea that it 
was something so unattainable 
in present society,” LaLonde 
said. “Hopefully the appeal of 
the decision will not change 
Judge Chang’s decision.”

LaLonde 
also 
said 
he 

believed the prejudice that 

plagues the gay community will 
only be alleviated when future 
generations take over.

“For us to have true equality, 

we must wait till the older 
generations pass on. I look at 
the future generations and see 
the ideas that they have and 
am very impressed with their 
knowledge and maturity with 
these subjects,” LaLonde said. 

Bob Edwards, president of 

Ann Arbor Parents, Families 
and Friends of Lesbians and 
Gays, also said he feels the 
decision will be met with little 
opposition.

“At 
work 
yesterday, 
the 

general response to the decision 
has 
been 
overwhelmingly 

positive.

is an attempt to connect 
students 
with 
the 
DEI 

program. 
Diversity 
peer 

educators, such as Lyons, 
work towards diversity and 
inclusion that is tailored to 
students’ 
experiences 
on 

campus. The NET plan was 
developed 
in 
response 
to 

multiple student organization 
requests, wanting to enhance 
their diversity and inclusion.

Implementation 
of 
the 

NET 
plan 
would 
mean 

conducting demographic and 
climate surveys for student 
organization and establishing 
an inclusivity plan tailored to 
that organization.

Other resolutions included 

the Survivor Empowerment 
Fund, which calls for the 
allocation of $5,000 to support 
the Sexual Assault Prevention 
and 
Awareness 
Center 

and 
other 
sexual 
assault 

empowerment organizations 
on campus. This fund would 
sponsor 
events 
and 
guest 

speakers.

LSA junior Izzy Baer, CSG 

vice president, explained how 
the Survivor Empowerment 
Fund is a way to increase 
survivors’ opportunities, as 
SAPAC would be able to put 
on more events and host more 
speakers.

“They don’t have funding 

for projects that they would 
otherwise have wanted to do,” 
Baer said.

Public Policy senior Daniel 

Greene, 
CSG 
president, 

closed 
the 
meeting 
with 

an announcement about an 
upcoming mental health event 
to help students cope with 
stress during finals.

“On Wednesday, Dec. 12 at 

6:00 p.m., we will be holding 
a workshop led by the director 
of 
CAPS 
(Counseling 
and 

Psychology Services), which 
will be titled, ‘10 things you 
can do right now to reduce 
your 
finals 
anxiety 
and 

stress,’” Greene said.

Justices Stephen Breyer and Neil 
Gorsuch and Reid Hoffman, the 
founder of LinkedIn.

For 
McNeal, 
winning 

the 
Marshall 
Scholarship 

represented a unique opportunity 
to pursue his interest in public 
policy and its intersections with 
science and technology. McNeal, 
who is planning on attending the 
University of Sussex, said he has 
been fascinated with physics and 
mathematics since high school 
but hopes the scholarship will 
allow him to indulge in other 
interests as well.

“When 
I 
started 

undergraduate, 
I 
had 
this 

linear progression in my mind 
about where I was going to go,” 
McNeal said. “I was going to 
go to high school, go through 
undergraduate, do physics, and 
then go straight to grad school, 
then have a postdoc, then keep 
going along that path. But then, 
along the way, I have other 
interests that motivate me and 
that linear progression kind of 
excludes those. It didn’t allow for 
much deviation and so I wanted 
to look at alternative paths.”

During 
his 
years 
at 
the 

University, 
McNeal 
served 

as the undergraduate liaison 
between students and faculty 
for the Physics Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion Committee. He 
also leads the Society of Physics 
Students and Japanese Language 
Circle as president of both groups. 
McNeal said his experiences 
working both in physics labs 
and in student organizations led 
him to realize that he wanted 

to incite meaningful change 
through policy work — he will 
pursue a degree in Science and 
Technology Policy starting in 
September.

“Just barreling forward just 

didn’t seem like the right thing to 
do,” McNeal said. “These other 
interests and these other sides of 
life that I’m interested in, they’re 
calling me as well to not just 
become a researcher — because 
there’s more to life than just 
physics research. And I wanted 
to be more impactful outside of 
that, and part of where I could 
see myself making a difference 
would be in some aspect of 
policy.”

summer after her freshman 
year 
studying 
advanced 

mathematics and combinatorics 
at the Budapest Semesters in 
Mathematics 
program, 
she 

became increasingly passionate 
about 
understanding 
the 

different ways math is taught. 
As an aspiring mathematics 
professor, Burcroff tutored high 
school students in the Michigan 
Math 
Circle 
and 
Wolverine 

Pathways program throughout 
her undergraduate career and 
found it meaningful to teach 
younger students about creative 
approaches to mathematics.

“All 
of 
these 
experiences 

allow me to mentor younger 
students, and I’ve watched a few 
of them as they’ve grown and 
some of them have gone on to 
the same Budapest Semesters in 
Mathematics program,” Burcroff 
said. “Walking them through 
the process and the benefits of 
what it can mean to study abroad 
or what it can mean to learn 
mathematics from a different 

culture really reaffirmed for me 
why I wanted to continue doing 
it.”

The Schwarzman Scholarship 

recruits 
students 
interested 

in 
international 
politics 
to 

pursue a master’s degree in 
Global Affairs in Beijing. Unlike 
the 
Marshall 
Scholarship, 

Schwarzman Scholars can hail 
from any country around the 
world — according to a press 
release published Monday. The 
2020 class includes students from 
38 countries and 119 universities. 
After a competitive application 
process resulting in 400 semi-
finalists, 147 applicants were 
chosen to receive the award.

As 
the 
University’s 
first 

Schwarzman 
Scholar, 
Batista 

said he hopes to both further 
his interest in global affairs 
and 
represent 
Brazil, 
his 

home country. Batista was a 
community assistant in Mosher-
Jordan 
Residence 
Hall 
his 

freshman year and currently 
serves as a residential adviser in 
South Quad Residence Hall. He 
is also an intern in the Boston 
Consulting 
Group’s 
Detroit 

office. For his senior thesis in 
the Ross School of Business, he 
is researching the role of trust 
and corruption in democratic 
societies. 
Batista 
said 
his 

experience as an international 
student at the University gave 
him a new perspective on Brazil’s 
politics and culture.

“As soon as I came to the 

U.S., I had a view that was as an 
outsider of the United States and 
almost as an outsider of my own 
country, as well,” Batista said. “I 
think that allowed me to think 
more deeply about systems of 
governance as opposed to just 

being immersed in that system 
and not exactly understanding 
what is going on.”

Batista 
said 
his 
reaction 

to winning the Schwarzman 
Scholarship was utter shock, 
especially because he is only the 
fifth Brazilian to ever receive the 
award.

“My jaw just dropped, and 

I think it dropped for a solid 
week,” Batista said.

Though 
Dyson 
attributed 

the 
award 
winners’ 
success 

to their incredible academic 
achievements, he also mentioned 
how the scholarships also reflect 
the 
students’ 
personalities, 

interests and character.

“I don’t want to set up a 

stereotype of what a Rhodes 
Scholar or Marshall Scholar 
or Schwarzman Scholar looks 
like,” Dyson said. “I really think 
it’s about your story — so who 
are you, where you’re going in 
the future, how this scholarship 
moves you forward.”

Each 
August, 
students 

complete the first step of the 
Marshall Scholarship application 
by 
seeking 
institutional 

endorsement from the University. 
According 
to 
Henry 
Dyson, 

director of the Office of National 
Scholarships and Fellowships, 
applicants are required to submit 
an online application and four 
letters 
of 
recommendation 

in a competitive nomination 
process. Once nominated, Dyson 
oversees their applications as 
they move to the national level 
and begin interviewing with the 
scholarship program itself.

“It’s quite prestigious and 

competitive even to be nominated 
for these scholarships,” Dyson 
said.

diversity statements and how 
higher education institutions 
use them to evaluate candidates. 
The authors were able to find 
better ways to elicit thorough 
statements 
from 
candidates, 

which Chavous said would make 
the practice more effective.

“We think that this is a really 

promising practice and tool,” 
Chavous said. “One part of 
our University DEI initiative 
is enhancing diversity, equity 
and inclusion in our campus 
environment and part of that 
is through the faculty that 
we hire. So having tools that 
allow us to both understand 
and assess the different types 
of 
work 
and 
contributions 

that faculty have made allows 
us to be more thoughtful and 
purposeful 
about 
selecting 

faculty who contribute to our 
academic mission and who 
contribute to an inclusive and 
equitable environment.”

The diversity statements are 

not a required part of hiring 
through the entire University, 
but several colleges within 
the University have recently 
begun using them, including 
the Ford School of Public Policy, 
which mandated in May that 
the statements be used in all 
future hiring. Paula Lantz, 
the school’s associate dean 
for academic affairs, said the 
diversity 
statements 
simply 

serve as additional information 
for consideration in the hiring 
process — information that is 
especially important given the 
subject matter taught in the 
Public Policy School.

“Issues related to diversity, 

equity and inclusion are really 
central to everything that we do 
here,” Lantz said. “There are not 
very many issues in public policy 
that don’t grapple with issues 
related to social inequality, 
to political difference, to how 
policies affect different groups 
of people across society. So 
when we are looking to expand 
our faculty, we really do want 
people who we think can 
contribute to how we teach in 
2018 and going forward and also 
how we engage in research and 
policy.”

Lantz said the practice of 

using the diversity statements 
will 
enrich 
the 
student 

experience by bringing in a 
more capable and holistically 
valuable faculty.

“Students gain from a process 

in which we are making sure 
that when we bring new faculty 
into the school, they’re going 
to really be contributing to all 
parts of our mission,” Lantz 
said. “Our entire community 
benefits when we bring in new 
faculty who we are sure are 
going to be contributing to all 
of the work that we want our 
community to be contributing 
to the world.”

Music, Theatre & Dance 

junior Saawan Tiwari echoed 

this 
sentiment, 
saying 

faculty with more diversity 
of experience offer students 
more ways of thinking that can 
aid them in a wide range of 
disciplines.

“Having more diversity on 

staff and diversity in teaching 
obviously 
helps 
because 

it’s 
being 
told 
something 

differently,” Tiwari said. “The 
more staff you have teaching in 
different ways, the more that the 
student can figure out what staff 
they like, figure out why that is 
and then figure out how to apply 
how that staff is teaching them 
things to other courses.”

Chavous noted there has 

been criticism of the practice 
of using diversity statements 
among the higher education 
academic 
community. 
Some 

educators 
have 
said 
the 

statements amount to required 
professions of political beliefs, 
which would have ambiguous 
implications for the academic 
freedom of the applicants.

However, Chavous said this 

is a misperception and added it 
is necessary for institutions to 
be specific about the purpose 
of the statements — they are 
intended to be used to gather 
information about candidates’ 
skills and strengths, not their 
political beliefs. 

One of Chavous’s general 

findings from the study was 
that 
diversity 
statements 

tended to be more useful when 
the instructions were more 
explicit. She emphasized there 
are numerous ways for faculty 
candidates to consider diversity 
in their work and contribute to 
the University environment. 

“We have to be thoughtful 

about the way that we ask for 
the 
information,” 
Chavous 

said. “Thoughtful and inclusive 
about the ways that we consider 
different ways of expressing 
diversity 
commitments 
— 

through scholarship, through 
teaching, through mentoring, 
through service.”

Chavous 
also 
said 
some 

academic units that request 
diversity 
statements 
have 

reported 
they 
are 
yielding 

more 
diverse 
applicant 

pools. Chavous believes this 
is 
happening 
because 
the 

practice of using the statements 
signals these institutions value 
diversity, which may attract 
more diverse applicants.

Chavous 
is 
now 
sharing 

the findings from the study 
at national conferences and 
using them to improve the 
practices of universities across 
the country. She believes the 
practice will directly affect the 
education students receive at 
the University and elsewhere.

Overall, Chavous expressed 

optimism about the tangible 
effects that the practice will 
have in the future.

“We think this is a start,” 

Chavous said. “But we really 
think this is a promising start of 
a practice and a set of practices 
that will have a high impact for 
our campus.

were 

struggling with the hazardous 
environmental 
exposures. 

Ferris 
said 
these 
findings 

inspired her to dedicate her 
work to equity and inclusion.

In her role at the National 

Audubon 
Society, 
Ferris’s 

work is focused on equity and 
inclusion of racially diverse 
groups 
that 
are 
currently 

underrepresented 
in 
the 

environmental 
conservation 

field. Ferris’s initiatives are 
directed toward diversifying 
the workers at Audubon as 
well as shifting the work of the 
organization itself.

In order to advance DEI 

initiatives, Ferris said Audubon 
is currently curating their first 
comprehensive report which 
gives a historical record of 
investments 
and 
initiatives 

that are advancing equity and 
diversity at Audubon.

Ferris drew attention to the 

Audubon’s Statement on Equity, 

Diversity and Inclusion, which 
reads, 
“Just 
as 
biodiversity 

strengthens natural systems, 
the 
diversity 
of 
human 

experience 
strengthens 
our 

conservation efforts for the 
benefit of nature and all human 
beings.”

“I think it’s important to draw 

parallels to what is going on 
in the conservation world and 
our aspirations,” Ferris said. 
“Just as we recognize, herald 
and acknowledge biodiversity 
of species we also need to be 
heralding and supporting social 
diversity in the work that we 
do.”

The organization is 114 years 

old, and diversity, Ferris said, 
was necessary for its survival.

“Our aim is to be more 

representative of groups that 
are currently underrepresented 
so that we can be around for 
another 
114 
years,” 
Ferris 

said. “The United States has 
been racially and culturally 
diverse for a really long time ... 
What we have now is a game of 
employer catch up.”

Sonia Joshi, the SEAS DEI 

program manager, explained 
how the DEI speaker series 
coincides with a new DEI 
seminar course that is offered 
in SEAS. In the past, the DEI 
speaker series usually consisted 
of one to two speakers per 
semester. This year, there have 
been one to two speakers per 
month.

“The premise (of the speakers) 

was to bring in environmental 
professionals of color that are 
doing impactful environment 
and conservation work, to really 
put the lens to people that might 
not realize that there are people 
of color that are working in the 
environmental space and are 
in leadership positions,” Joshi 
said.

Joshi also said the DEI course 

is supposed to highlight that 
diversity, equity and inclusion 
is a growing field, and many 
environmental 
organizations 

are now creating positions and 
departments solely dedicated to 
this type of work.

Environment 
and 

Sustainability graduate student 
Zoe Fullem is enrolled in the 

DEI seminar class and said this 
speaker was more informative 
than previous ones.

“We’ve had a lot of speakers 

but this was cool because she 
actually touched on what she’s 
done at a huge organization,” 
Fullem 
said. 
“We 
haven’t 

had someone from such a big 
environmental organization.”

Environment 
and 

Sustainability graduate student 
Joy Yakie said the seminars that 
coincide with the DEI course 
are helpful in comprehending 
the material.

“Taking the class with the 

seminar, that’s when you feel 
the impact more,” Yakie said. 
“If I had taken the class without 
this 
seminar, 
it 
would 
be 

purely just theoretical reading 
journals.”

Fullem believes the one-

credit class is not enough to 
fully delve into the topic of 
diversity, equity and inclusion.

“We wish we could get deeper 

into things,” Fullem said. “I feel 
like it’s not enough. But it’s a 
great pairing to come to these 
speaker series.”

A University of Michigan 

study published last Friday 
found anywhere from 60 to 
80 percent of patients are not 
completely truthful with their 
doctors.

The study, led by Brian 

Zikmund-Fisher, 
associate 

professor of Health Behavior 
and Health Education at the 
University, 
examined 
the 

frequency of patients failing to 
disclose relevant information 
to their clinicians.

The study used an online 

survey to assess participants’ 
interactions 
with 
health 

professionals, asking them to 
answer about what aspects of 
their lives they failed to tell the 
truth about, such as how often 
they exercise and whether or 
not they take their prescriptions 
correctly. Researchers found 
the 
main 
reason 
patients 

withheld information was a 
fear of being judged.

Zikmund-Fisher 
said 

clinicians did not wish to make 
patients feel embarrassed or 
judged. 

“There’s certainly part of 

it that’s internal,” Zikmund-
Fisher said. “They didn’t want 
to take up more of their health 

care providers time, they didn’t 
want their healthcare providers 
to think they’re stupid, they 
didn’t want this information 
to be in their record (and) they 
didn’t want to hear how bad the 
behavior is.” 

The 
study 
found 
young 

people were roughly 20 percent 
more likely to lie to their health 
care 
providers 
than 
older 

generations. 
In 
particular, 

younger 
female 
participants 

with worse self-rated health 
reported 
withholding 

information from health care 
professionals more often.

Researcher Aaron Scherer, an 

associate professor of Internal 
Medicine at the University of 
Iowa, said he wants to know if 
more honest relationships could 
occur if a doctor shares similar 
identities to their patient.

“One 
interesting 
way 
to 

build off these findings would 
be to test whether the extent 
to which a patient shares 
similarities with their doctor 
(e.g., they share the same race 
or gender) influences their 
tendency to tell their doctor 
potentially important health 
information or not,” Scherer 
wrote in an email interview.

In order to lower the rate of 

patient dishonesty, Zikmund-
Fisher 
said 
greater 
verbal 

compassion from the health 
care provider is necessary.

“This is speculation, we do 

not have evidence for this in 
our study, but my speculation is 
that now that we know that this 
is in fact quite common it may 
be important for healthcare 
providers to acknowledge that,” 
Zikmund-Fisher 
said. 
“Just 

say to patients, ‘I know that it 
is difficult sometimes to share 
with me if you don’t understand 
me, if you aren’t following 
the instructions, if you are 
engaging in behaviors that you 
know you probably shouldn’t 
be.’ Acknowledge that sharing 
that type of information is 
hard … and to try and reassure 
patients that.”

Scherer 
said 
empathy 
is 

important from the patients as 
well.

“I think one solution to this 

problem is the development of 
increased empathy from both 
doctors and patients,” Scherer 
wrote. “On the patient-side, 
I don’t think most patients 
realize the enormous number 
of demands that are being 
placed on doctors right now, 
so it might be necessary for a 
broader information campaign 
about these demands to change 
how the general public view 
their doctors.”

When presented with the 

research, Nursing sophomore 
Jacob 
Doxen 
said 
he 
was 

surprised 
to 
find 
out 
the 

percentage 
of 
dishonest 

patients was so high.

“It’s shocking because people 

in 
the 
medical 
profession, 

nurses and doctors, are just 
trying to help their patients,” 
Doxen 
said. 
“There’s 
no 

judgment involved in being a 
nurse or a doctor. We can really 
only provide the help that the 
patient needs.”

However, 
Doxen 
said 
he 

is hopeful for the future and 
believes trust is necessary to 
create the best relationship 
between a patient and a health 
care professional.

“In nursing school, one of 

the biggest things that they 
emphasize is building trust 
with your patients and proving 
to them that they can be open 
with you and honest with 
you,” Doxen said. “Make sure 
that trust is established and 
continue to build upon it with 
every visit or every time you 
interact. It’s a lot easier to lose 
trust than it is to build trust.”

n 2013, an undergraduate 
research project suggesting 
Oreos activated more of the 
brain’s pleasure centers than 
either cocaine or morphine set 
off a storm of media attention. 
However, the study was done in 
rats and never directly compared 
Oreos to either drug. Another 
blitz of media coverage, this 
time claiming cheese was as 
addictive as crack cocaine, was 
predicated on a study by associate 
professor Ashley Gearhardt, in 
the Department of Psychology 
at the University of Michigan. 
Ironically, Gearhardt’s study only 
mentioned cheese a few times. 
Bad science journalism aside, 
can foods be addictive? Is food 
addiction a valid behavioral health 
condition?
According to the American 
Society of Addiction Medicine, 
addiction is a chronic brain 
disease where “an individual 
pathologically pursues reward 
and/or relief by substance use 
and other behaviors.” While this 
definition is harsh upon first 
reading, it is important to note 
that not everyone exposed to 
something 
addictive 
develops 
an addiction. For instance, only 
8 to 12 percent of people (still a 
concerning statistic) who misuse 
prescription opioids, e.g. taking 
them not as their doctor ordered, 
develop opioid use disorder. So no 
need to fear, yet, Oreo lovers.
Oreos, cheese and other foods 
some would label as addictive 
have one thing in common: the 
bliss point. The bliss point is the 
right amount of salt, sugar and fat 
to maximize a food’s irresistibility. 
Like the tobacco companies that 
genetically modify tobacco plants 
to double their nicotine content, 
food 
companies 
meticulously 
design processed foods to take 

advantage of our evolutionary 
cravings for salt, sugar and fat for 
more sales.
Anthropologists estimate that 
Homo sapiens has been around for 
about 300,000 years and, for a vast 
majority of our species’s time on 
Earth, foods high in sugar, fat and/
or salt were a luxury. Since we 
need all three of those nutrients 
to live, it makes sense we evolved 
neural circuits that reward us 
for obtaining fatty, sugary and 
salty foods. Fast forward to 2018, 
however, where a vast majority 
of humanity gets the nutrition it 
needs from these foods and you 
run into a problem: We no longer 
need to seek fatty, sugary and salty 
foods to survive, but the neural 
circuits of 300,000 years ago still 
exist.
The one thing that trips people 
up the most about the idea of food 
addiction is the question, “How can 
food be addictive if we need it to 
live?” We still need fat, sugar and 
salt, however, we have innumerably 
more sources of these ingredients 
than our ancestors did. Something 
a lot of people do not realize about 
drugs like marijuana is that their 
addictive properties are rooted in 
biology. Your body is coursing with 
naturally produced chemicals that 
are structurally similar to a molecule 
of THC. That is why THC is able 
to activate your endocannabinoid 
receptors and cause the effects one 
feels when smoking or eating pot. 
Marijuana would get no one high if 
THC was not similar to anandamide, 
a brain chemical.
Why do I draw the parallel 
between marijuana and food? The 
brain needs a molecule to activate 
the endocannabinoid receptors. Both 
anandamide and THC will do the 
trick, however, they are not the same. 
I apply the same concept to food. We 
need food, yes. However, an Oreo and 

a cucumber are not created equal nor 
should they be treated as such.
In my conversations with people 
at the School of Public Health’s 
Department of Nutritional Sciences, I 
have observed that people readily fall 
squarely into the “yes, food addiction 
exists” and “no, food addiction does 
not exist.” I have already presented 
arguments for the former, but what 
about the latter camp?
The most consistent and cogent 
argument I hear against food 
addiction as a concept is that it is 
seen as conflicted with the “intuitive 
model of eating.” Intuitive eating is 
all about learning to respect your 
internal cues for eating, such as 
fullness, and rejecting external cues 
like diet culture. This model also 
maintains that no food is a bad food. 
On face value, the idea of addictive 
foods flies in the face of intuitive 
eating. It’s an external cue that makes 
some food “bad.”
I respect this argument and the 
intuitive model of eating, however, 
I believe the conflict is rooted in 
misunderstanding, not fundamental 
incompatibility. We label drugs of 
abuse like opioids and cocaine 
as “bad” and the dominance of 
Alcoholics Anonymous and its 
cousin Narcotics Anonymous in 
the addiction treatment world lead 
many to believe that abstinence is 
the only treatment for addiction. 
If that were the case, then we 
would tell people to avoid certain 
foods which could be addictive, 
which as I said before, goes 
against intuitive eating. While AA 
and NA have done worlds of good, 
their total abstinence mindset is 

E

very day, I walk 
out my front door, 
and turn to lock 
it behind me. I cross the 
front porch, take the four 
steps to the sidewalk, and 
turn 
left 
up 
Benjamin 
Street as it curves into 
Mary Street. I take a left 
on Packard Street and a 
right on Hill Street and 
walk up the steps to the 
Weill Hall, where I have 
most of my classes.
I do this walk every day, at 
least twice a day, oftentimes 
more. As the semester has 
slowly seeped away I have 
taken this path in Birkenstocks, 
Blundstones, snow boots and 
high heels. On the way, I have 
listened to music and podcasts 
or chatted with a friend as we 
strode shoulder to shoulder. 
These four short blocks have 
seen 
me 
content, 
anxious, 
stressed 
and 
triumphant. I 
usually find myself lost in 
thought, concerned for a friend, 
thinking about the weekend’s 
plans or pondering how I’ll ever 
get all my work done that day.
I feel as though the weight 
of all that contact has worn a 
path along the pavement that 
exactly matches the length 
of my stride and the contours 
of my feet, like the concrete’s 
muscle memory has come to 
expect me. I had a similar 
sensation last year on my daily 
walk to class along Oakland 
Avenue, and my freshman year 
as I crossed in front of Mosher-
Jordan Residence Hall and 
along the bridge beside the 
Central 
Campus 
Recreation 
Building each day, winding 
around the Ruthven Natural 
History Museum. I spent a 
lot of time on each of those 
routes, engendering a feeling 
of nostalgia when I walk them 
now.
Over Thanksgiving break, my 
family and I drove past our old 
house, where I spent the first six 
years of my life. As we wound 
along the strangely familiar 
roads, I could practically feel 
my head resting against my 
little car seat, knowing my dad 
would pick me up and piggyback 
me to bed once we got home. 
I imagine I’ll find that same 
comfortable familiarity in 10 
years when I return to campus, 
carrying with me a completely 
different life, with different 
worries and a new soundtrack, 
walking these old routes and 
re-familiarizing myself with 

the shape of my 
younger stride.
When I was 
16, 
I 
spent 
a 
summer 
studying 
in 
a 
program 
in 
England. 
It was only a 
month, but I 
made 
some 
wonderful 
friends 
and 
became enamored with the 
city and University of Oxford. 
I 
remember 
crying 
as 
I 
prepared to leave, lugging my 
overstuffed 
suitcase 
across 
the dormitory threshold and 
waving goodbye to my new 
closest friends. On my way 
to the airport, we zig-zagged 
through 
the 
now-familiar 
streets and hills. As we did 
so, I wrote, “Throughout our 
lives we nestle into pockets 
of comfort, pockmarking the 
globe 
with 
our 
memories, 
notches of home that lay vacant 
when we leave, as only our 

bodies can fill them perfectly.”
By that point in my life, I 
had a lot of these pockets. I had 
school, camp and my family 
home. I had my cousin’s living 
room in Toronto and friends’ 
houses in Cleveland. I had the 
theater rehearsal room, the 
student newspaper lab and the 
park where the soccer team 
practiced.
Now, 
five 
years 
later, 
my 
imprint 
portfolio 
has 
expanded. But I have the 
benefit of something I didn’t 
have at 16: a little distance. 
The next summer I returned 
to Oxford as a tourist, eager to 
show the friends with whom 
I was traveling the city I had 
come to adore, waiting to fill 
once again the little me-shaped 
notch I had left behind. It 
was a fun day. We went to my 
favorite Indian restaurant and 
ice cream shop. We walked the 
same roads I had walked every 
day that summer. We even 
returned to my dorm, crossing 

the threshold through which 
I’d dragged my suitcase my last 
morning in England.
I spent all day trying to fill 
up the little crevice I’d left 
behind, but found I couldn’t 
quite fit. I could practically feel 
the dent, running my fingers 
around its edges as we strolled 
through town and by a beloved 
bookstore. I could sense it as we 
smelled the fryers bubbling in 
my favorite chip shop. But I was 
a different shape than I’d been 
the summer before. Parts had 
been stretched, parts refined 
and some parts had been 
moved around or discarded 
altogether. It was bittersweet 
to find so tangibly all the ways 
in which I was now somehow 
different.
My column this semester 
has been all about reaching 
back to feel the edges of these 
indentations, 
relearning 
their contours and finding 
comfort 
in 
the 
inevitable 
swell of nostalgia. It’s been 
an introspective journey that 
has forced me to recognize 
the transience of these few 
years in college that we are all 
experiencing together. There is 
a lingering frustration still left 
over from that day in Oxford. 
The idea of recapturing a long 
lost feeling is tantalizing, but 
probably fruitless.
The only thing we can do 
is leave the highest quality 
imprint possible. As I walk 
to class each day I try to 
do so mindfully, not always 
allowing myself to wander 
off in thought but rather 
make a point to feel the 
temperature on my skin and 
smile at strangers I pass. I try 
to recognize the shape I am 
making on the world around 
me so maybe I can feel it more 
genuinely when I return one 
day. We are always told that 
college will be some of the 
best years of our lives. So we 
should stretch as far as we 
can, making impressions all 
throughout campus, leaving 
the shape of ourselves up and 
down Ann Arbor. The more 
we do, the more memories we 
make, and the more we have to 
look back on years from now, 
smiling against the grain of a 
bittersweet nostalgia — grateful 
for the many places in the world 
we can call home.

A 

bombshell 
report 
was 
dropped 
over 
Thanksgiving. The Fourth 
National 
Climate 
Assessment 
provided 
perhaps 
the 
most 
detailed scientific assessment of 
how climate change is going to 
impact every area of our lives. 
Produced by a confederation of 
13 federal agencies, including 
NASA, 
the 
Department 
of 
Defense, National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric 
Administration, 
National 
Science 
Foundation, 
U.S. Department of Agriculture 
and more, it details societal 
response strategies to mitigate 
and adapt to the effects of global 
climate change. Projected effects 
include massive declines in crop 
yield, sea-level rise that threatens 
millions, devastating wildfires 
and billions of dollars of economic 
losses every year. All of this 
will destabilize food and social 
systems we rely upon, which will 
exacerbate conditions leading to 
war and mass migration. Almost 
every national and international 
scientific body on the planet has 
converged around this reality, 
pointing to climate change as 
the largest impending disaster 
humankind has ever faced, and 
urging rapid action.
The advantage of a global 
scientific consensus is that we also 
have a roadmap to avoid these 
catastrophic effects and a metric 
to gauge our progress. The NCA 
reaffirms that avoiding the most 
damaging 
effects 
requires 
us 
to limit warming to 1.5 degrees 
Celsius, and a report released by the 
International 
Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change in 
October indicates that achieving 
this will necessitate global carbon 
neutrality by 2050. This is still 
technically feasible, but it requires 
dramatic and immediate action.
Unfortunately, 
we 
at 
the 
University of Michigan have a lot 
of catching up to do. Universities 
are particularly well placed to act 
on climate: They have the means 
to understand the science, are not 
subject to the same quarterly focus 
as private institutions and have a 
stated mission to “serve the people.” 
In spite of this, the University has 
been woefully negligent when 
it comes to climate action — our 
emissions 
reduction 
goals 
are 
among the very bottom of Big Ten 
institutions, we lack a climate 

action plan, our administration 
refused to divest from fossil fuels 
despite broad community support 
and we have yet to join any of the 
large national coalitions (such as 
the University Climate Change 
Coalition or Climate Leadership 
Network) that help universities 
and their communities to become 
more sustainable. It has been noted 
in the press how badly we compare 
to 
Michigan 
State 
University, 
which is highlighted in the NCA 
for generating 5 percent of their 
energy locally via solar carports, 
and to The Ohio State University, 
which is 10th in the Environmental 
Protection Agency’s list of the top 
30 
green-powered 
universities 
and which committed to carbon 
neutrality 10 years ago. University 
President Mark Schlissel’s own 
Greenhouse 
Gas 
Reduction 
Committee recommended back in 
2015 that the University commit to 
much more ambitious targets and 
detailed specific ways to achieve 
such targets, but three years later, 
little has changed.

We can and must do better. 
The U-M community is filled with 
knowledgeable 
and 
passionate 
individuals, but climate change is 
an issue that we can only tackle if 
we work together, and we need bold 
leadership to focus our collective 
efforts. In a sign of hope, Schlissel 
announced in October that he 
was committed to “putting U-M 
on a trajectory towards carbon 
neutrality,” along with his intention 
to form a commission that would 
be “tasked with developing our 
plan.” But for this commission to 
be effective, Schlissel must commit 
to a defined, science-based date 
for carbon neutrality. In a detailed 
letter to Schlissel, the Climate Action 
Movement at U-M (of which I am 
a part) has urged him to commit 
the University to achieving carbon 
neutrality by 2035, a goal in keeping 

with the IPCC timeline. This puts a 
firm date with a tangible outcome to 
the pledge that Schlissel has already 
made to pursue efforts to limit 
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as 
laid out in the 2015 Paris agreement, 
and also reposition the University 
community as leaders in the fight 
against climate change.
Without a specific date, the 
commission’s 
mandate 
remains 
frighteningly vague and we will lose 
valuable time as they debate what 
their mandate even is, let alone how to 
develop a plan to achieve it. It will be 
far too easy for the commission to set 
the bar low and fall back on Schlissel’s 
qualification that such a plan must 
be “financially responsible,” an 
excuse for inaction that is all too 
familiar to a younger generation 
that has seen its future grossly 
and 
systematically 
undervalued. 
While there is a consensus that 
aggressive climate action now will 
be far cheaper than if it is delayed, 
the necessary investments in our 
future will still be substantial, and 
we will need the mandate of a public 
commitment from the highest levels 
of the University in order to sustain 
momentum. 
Schlissel rightly calls climate 
change “the defining scientific and 
social problem of our age.” Beyond 
the science we produce, the 
greatest asset that the University 
has to offer in the fight against 
climate change is bold and public 
leadership. Even though we at 
the University produce nearly a 
third of Ann Arbor’s emissions, 
Schlissel is right that simply 
becoming carbon neutral will 
not alone make a significant 
difference for climate change. The 
University’s impact — our impact 
— will only be meaningful if it is 
public and if it is ambitious. We 
must put to rest the notion that 
the necessary changes are simply 
too difficult or impractical. We 
can be what we have claimed to 
be all along: Leaders and the Best. 
The world needs leaders right 
now, and with some of the world’s 
greatest minds, a commitment 
to serve the public good and 
an endowment larger than the 
economies of one-third of the world’s 
nations, no one is better positioned to 
lead than we are. I hope we do, and

The best way I can describe 
my style is by using the words 
of rapper and feminist icon 
Princess Nokia. In an interview 
with The Guardian she said, 
“(I’m) not a typical clean-cut 
young lady, always a bit rough 
around the edges, always a bit 
messy … I didn’t wear the cute 
things girls wore at the time, 
I was on some baggy clothes, 
Harriet The Spy tomboy shit.”
The 
word 
“tomboy” 
has 
always been in my vocabulary. 
At first, others put this label 
on me, quantifying me into 
the category of baggy-shorts 
wearing, 
ponytail-styling, 
young 
female 
athletes. 
In 
addition to my wardrobe, I 
have grossly bitten fingernails, 
“man-sized” hands and feet, a 
sharp jawline and a prominent 
nose. I’m not the typical, petite 
female 
with 
soft 
features 
and cute actions — I’m no 
manic pixie dream girl. As I 
grew older, however, I found 
myself wrestling with this 
“tomboy” 
label, 
considering 
whether or not I was one and 
understanding the stigmas that 
came with it.
My style has always been 
an uphill battle because it was 
always about confronting my 
identity. The way we style 
ourselves matters to the world 
around us as much as it matters 
to us individually. My style 
journey has not been natural 
or conforming. It has taken 
me years to fully see that my 
own beautiful body wears the 
clothes and that the clothes 
don’t wear me. Discovering 
that nobody, including myself, 
needs to mold into society’s 
notion 
of 
femininity 
or 
culturally-accepted 
fashion 
styles, I began to realize that 
these notions apply to labels 
like “tomboy.” Tomboy has 
its 
own 
society-influenced 
definition. And it’s bullshit.
Before I became aware of 
this beautiful idea of what 
it means to be a tomboy, it’s 
important to reflect on the 
hurdles I leaped in order to 
finally feel comfortable in the 
clothes I wear today.
In 7th grade, a boy told me 
that I looked like a man. And he 
told me to my face.
I had a wide gap in my teeth, 
dirty blonde, surfer-looking 
hair and swimmer shoulders 
that probably intimidated this 
frail, 13-year-old, pubescent 
weenie. In other words, I 
believe my appearance and my 
personality were too outwardly 
“confident” for him — which 
unfortunately is often socially 
synonymous with the word 
“masculine.”
While I chuckle at the 
comment now, I won’t forget it. 
To some extent, it still hurts. 
I contemplated my identity 
for months after. I thought 
about what I was saying, 
doing and, most importantly, 
wearing: graphic tees and zip-
up hoodies, skinny jeans and 
soccer sweatpants, Converse 
and flip-flops, baseball hats 
and tight ponytails. No makeup. 
No nail polish.
“What about me makes me 
man-ish?” I thought. “Am I not 
the cool, punky and sporty girl 
I always thought I was?” Yes, 
these are highly introspective 
questions for a 13-year-old girl 
to ask herself. But realistically, 
these 
are 
questions 
that 
many 
young 
adults 
still 
ask themselves today — me 
included.
Shouting 
aggressively 
in 

her New York accent, Princess 
Nokia raps these lyrics in her 
track “Tomboy,” declaring it 
as one of her most popular, 
confidence-boosting anthems: 
“Who that is, hoe? / That 
girl is a tomboy! / That girl 
is a tomboy! / That girl is a 
tomboy!”
For my first prom, my mom 
took me dress shopping. The 
tomboy and modest girl that I 
am decided to seek out simpler 
dresses with fewer rhinestones, 
duller colors and styles that 
made 
my 
fully-developed 
chest look smaller. As the awe-
inspiring 
feminist 
activist 
Emma Watson once said: “My 
idea of sexy is that less is more. 
The less you reveal, the more 
people can wonder.” Modesty 
is, indeed, sexy.

My mom can sometimes treat 
me like her own Barbie doll and 
dress me the way she wants. In 
the store, she found an open-
back, 
head-to-toe, 
hot-pink 
sequin gown that was “made 
for my body,” considering there 
was only one size and no zipper 
on the dress. As she shrieked 
in excitement, I was utterly 
disgusted. Overwhelmed, in 
fact.
Since I love my mother, I 
tried it on for her. She loved 
the way it framed my muscular 
back 
and 
bustier 
chest. 
I 
laughed for a minute, showing 
my mom how ridiculous I felt 
in this gown and how I could 
never walk into any event 
wearing it. But afterwards, 
while she journeyed around 
the store finding more dresses, 
I went to the dressing room and 
cried, peeling off the heavy, 
sequin-vomit dress.
I cried because I felt ugly. 
Not because the dress itself 
was ugly or obnoxious or 
extreme (which, to an extent, 
it absolutely was). But rather 
because the dress was wearing 
me, and I couldn’t see the girl 
behind the sequins. I felt ugly 
because I didn’t feel like me.
“I’m really into the fact that 
I could walk into any room 
and snatch any man in there 
like it’s nothing. A cup, baggy 
sweatpants and a fucked-up 
ponytail and they’ll still love 
me. I am one captivating son 
a bitch,” said Princess Nokia 
in an interview with Mass 
Appeal. “Who I am and what 
makes me me, the New York 
City project rat; the messy but 
beautiful; the sloppy but still 
sexy. When you got the juice, 
everybody wants to drink from 
your pitcher.”
My 
sophomore 
year 
of 
college, I met with an energy 
reader and medium. In an 
attempt to analyze my energy 
balances and chakra alignment, 
she spiritually sensed the flood 
of masculine energy that I was 
exerting. She asked if it made 
an effect on my relationships 
and day-to-day life.
With my legs spread open 

and body slouched into the 
couch, I rested my cheek onto 
my fist. I nonchalantly told 
her that I “tend to dress more 
manly.” I expressed how I don’t 
do my hair or paint my nails or 
do my makeup all the time. I 
felt as though boys were not as 
attracted to me as they would 
be to other girls.
My medium told me that 
although 
my 
style 
choices 
have something to do with 
this masculine energy, it was 
my inner self that was truly 
causing this energy to radiate. 
She assured me that it was 
my confidence, my creativity, 
my giddiness, my exuberant 
language and intense beliefs 
that ignited this masculine 
energy. That energy just so 
happened 
to 
be 
presented 
through my appearance.
And that is when I began to 
believe that the tomboy isn’t 
a type of person or a specific 
style — it’s an attitude.
“Male energy is currently 
being 
challenged 
by 
alpha 
female energy,” Princess Nokia 
added in the Mass Appeal 
interview. My tomboyishness 
wasn’t a factor of me being 
manly after all, but rather 
a 
prime 
feature 
of 
my 
femininity. To some degree, 
my 
tomboyishness 
is 
my 
confidence, my superpower, my 
alpha-femaleness. 
When I lace up my sneakers 
and slap a beanie to my head, 
I’m unequivocally putting on 
my supersuit. I’m less nervous 
when 
speaking 
to 
people 
(especially flirting with boys), 
and I tend to find my most 
creative ideas. I notice myself 
apologizing less and smiling 
more.
I’d rather wear joggers and a 
t-shirt than skinny jeans with 
a crop-top. I like my baseball 
cap loose around my head with 
my thick hair pushing out on 
all sides. I’m more comfortable 
when I sit with my knees to 
my chest than one crossed 
over the other. I’d rather 
wear head-to-toe black (yes, a 
turtleneck, black leggings and 
ankle-high black boots with no 
skin showing) than wear any 
drop of color. Through these 
outfits, 
my 
tomboyishness 
is revealed to the world — a 
visual representation of who 
I am within the clothes. It’s 
not necessarily the physical 
article of clothing or a sport or 
a tone of voice that constitutes 
this label, it’s the clothing that 
ignites the attitude and the 
attitude that manifests as the 
tomboy.
Sure, my outfits represent 
how I’m feeling on a day-to-
day basis, fluctuating between 
these male and female energies. 
Some days I do show more of 
my femininity, like when I wear 
a 
“Buffy”-esque, 
’90s-mood 
outfit with knee-boots, a mini 
skirt 
and 
dangly 
earrings. 
But on any day when I am the 
most comfortable in what I 
am wearing, how I am acting 
and where I am going, those 
are the days when I represent 
my truest tomboy — my truest 
self. Coming to terms with 
my stylistic choices and my 
personality, I can confidently 
say that I’ll forever be a tomboy. 
I can only hope that every little 
girl can unapologetically find 
her own version of the tomboy, 
becoming the most authentic 
version of herself, regardless of 
wardrobe.
“The only way you can make 
something work is really by 
being your most unique self and 
having a lane,” Princess Nokia 
stated in an NME interview. 
“And there’s no one in my lane.”

The last evening of Nov. has 
always 
been 
unremarkable 
compared to the exciting holiday 
season that precedes it. Yet, this 
year the 30th of Nov. had a surprise 
in store for me. Little did I know 
that the festivity that would be 
accompanying my friends and 
me on our evening out would be 
one overflowing with fantastical 
holiday cheer. The friction of 
bodies huddled together beneath 
the string of decorative lights kept 
us warm in the chilled air as we 
nudged our way through crowds 
of people looking to spend big this 
year at the Kerrytown KindleFest. 
Had the market been indoors, I 
wouldn’t have felt as great a sense of 
community as I did when I smiled 
in comradery to rosy cheeks and 
chilly noses buried beneath layers 
of scarves and hats. Ann Arborites 
and students alike joined together 
in sifting through German food 
(pretzels, 
bratwursts, 
roasted 
nuts), strolling musicians and even 
Santa Claus himself at the annual 
outdoor Holiday Market. The joy 
on the faces of children as they 
roasted marshmallows over a pit 
of roaring fire seemed to radiate 
to the rest of the hoards of people 
in attendance. Everyone walked 
cheerfully along to the quick tune 
of the violin coming from the 
musician in the center. 
“We should hang out outside 
of the University more often!” my 
friend whispered to me as she was 
passed a free sample of Glühwein 

(a mulled wine) from a cheerful 
bearded gentleman. 
I couldn’t help but agree with 
her. So often, I feel as though 
the town of Ann Arbor and the 
University do not coincide with 
one another. Yet, the Kerrytown 
KindleFest 
seamlessly 
allowed 
townees and students to happily 
enjoy the company of one another 
through 
an 
appreciation 
of 
this niche little city in eastern 
Michigan. 
It was quite smart of the 
organizers of the event to provide 
activities all members of the family 
could enjoy beneath the awning 
bending over the market. While 
adults shopped, kids met Santa 
Claus. Those over 21 could sip 
German beer, and those under 21 
could do arts and crafts. I looked to 
my right and saw a woman brush 
her graying hair behind her ear 
as she swayed to the festive music 
while the child holding her hand 
attempted to move her little legs 
as quick as her grandmother’s. I 
looked to my right and watched a 
group of 20-somethings laughing 
jovially with a group of teenagers 
about a funny art piece one of 
the artisans had created. This 
event was the perfect curator for 
togetherness between not only 
Ann Arborites and students, but 
families of all ages. 
One aspect of the event that 
was not so age- (or economically-) 
friendly were the prices. All the 
vendors at the festival had created 
such interesting pieces of art. I so 
desperately wanted to purchase a 
present for my mother, who loves 
German-inspired festivals such as 

this one. However, when I’d look 
at the price tag of the art I wanted, 
the number following the dollar 
sign would be far too high to not 
make a twinge of guilt churn inside 
of me. I couldn’t imagine families 
attending the event that had debts 
greater than mine. While there 
were many free activities, it still 
seemed that the majority of the 
crowd this market drew in were 
people in the upper middle class 
(and mostly white). I’d like to see 
the market step outside of the box 
next year, and incorporate more 
economically friendly vendors and 
activities. Then, more students 
would be inclined to go, as well 
as Ann Arborites whose incomes 
don’t nearly match that of the 
people I saw on Friday night. 
With that thought aside, I left 
the market with a spirit chipper 
enough to help me persevere 
through Dec. — a month that is 
filled to the brim with exams, 
pressing due dates and increasingly 
colder weather. While I’d like to 
see more free activities and more 
economically diverse crowds, the 
event did a terrific job at igniting 
the sense of togetherness that 
seems to fit so nicely with the 
holiday season. All the vendors 
were friendly enough to tell me 
interesting stories about their art, 
their businesses and their lives. 
With a funny story stuck in one ear 
and holiday music ringing happily 
in the other, I left the event with 
much more than I had coming 
in. I’d recommend it to everyone 
who’s in need of an evening away 
from the stresses of the day, which 
seems to be us all.

EVENT REVIEW

Kerrytown KindleFest 
sparks the holiday season

Netflix’s Italian drama “Baby” 
occupies a bizarre space in the 
TV quality spectrum. It took me 
only a couple sittings to watch 
its six episodes, each clocking 
in at around 45 minutes. The 
plot moved fairly quickly and 
had enough tension and intrigue 
to keep me hooked, but by the 
end of it, I couldn’t help but 
feel 
rather 
underwhelmed. 
Normally, if I deem a show 
binge-worthy and waste away 
potential hours of productivity, I 
expect to arrive at the end with 
something along the lines of my 
jaw on the floor, hair messed up 
in an existential crisis, as if I was 
somehow taken around a lap of 
Monza by Michael Schumacher 
himself.
“Baby” is set in the swanky, 
upscale neighborhood Parioli, 
in Rome, in a sea of the most 
pretentious, despicable people 
you’ll 
ever 
meet. 
Chiara 
(Benedetta 
Porcaroli, 
“Tutto 
può succedere”) and her best 
friend Camilla (Chabeli Sastre 
Gonzalez, newcomer) are two 
of the more likable kids in 
their snooty private school. 
They become entangled with 
more 
“unsavory” 
characters, 
including 
Ludovica 
(Alice 
Pagani, “Loro 2”) and Damiano 
(Riccardo Mandolini, “Al Posto 
Tuo”). Ludovica is an infamous 
outcast, known for filming a sex 
tape with an ex, while Damiano, 

a new student who is rougher 
around the edges than most, 
is the illegitimate son of an 
ambassador.
Rather 
quickly, 
Chiara 
becomes 
a 
more 
rebellious 
version of herself, spending 
late nights partying and getting 
involved with sketchy characters 
such as Saverio (Paolo Calabresi) 
and Fiore (Giuseppe Maggio), 
two nightclub owners. The two 
men entice Chiara and Camilla 
into becoming escorts. They are 

extremely manipulative, using 
the girls’ feelings of alienation 
to their own nefarious purposes 
without any threats of violence 
at the onset.
Porcaroli and Pagani are the 
two standout performers, easily 
transitioning from vulnerable 
to confident and self-assured. 
While there are several side 
characters involved in the story 
as well, none of their storylines 
are quite as developed and 
insightful. “Baby” shows these 
two falling into the depths of 
the Italian underworld out of 
a mixture of desiring to rebel 
against 
upper 
class 
ennui, 
and the negligence of their 
parents. Chiara’s parents are 
all but separated, only staying 
together for their daughter, 
while Camilla’s single mother 

squanders 
what 
money 
she 
has with her new boyfriend, 
neglecting Camilla’s school fees.
However, “Baby” never quite 
gives the depth its own story 
deserves. The real-life teen 
prostitution scandal that it is 
based on is truly disturbing and 
creepy, but “Baby” does not make 
it seem so. It rarely gives any 
window into the psychological 
torment Chiara and Camilla go 
through, from their dealings 
with the predatory Saverio and 
Fiore to their disintegrating 
relationships with their own 
friends and families. The show 
never settles on tone, flipping 
often between “Skins”-esque 
teen drama and adult thriller. 
When it’s the former, it is never 
as insightful as “Skins” was. 
Damiano, 
another 
character 
who feels out-of-place due to his 
lower-class background and the 
absence of his dead mother, is 
sympathetic, but is mostly used 
as Chiara and Camilla’s love 
interest. Unlike many shows, 
it does not fall into the trap of 
gratuitous voyeurism, but it 
equally avoids truly exploring 
the vain, status-obsessed world 
they live in.
“Baby” has a lot of potential to 
further explore the psychology 
of these teenagers in Parioli, 
but it needs to flesh out its 
surrounding cast to allow even 
Chiara and Camilla’s story to 
develop. At the moment, it takes 
a superficial view of a troubling 
real-life story and makes little 
out of it.

More than almost any movie 
released this year, “Instant Family” 
wears its heart on its sleeve. Early 
on, as Mark Wahlberg’s (“Mile 
22”) Pete and Rose Byrne’s (“Peter 
Rabbit”) Ellie walk through a 
foster care center, the camera 
lingers on a poster announcing 
“November is National Adoption 
Month!” Throughout the movie, 
characters work to make clear the 
plight of youth in the system and 
the importance of finding them 
loving homes. Before the credits 
roll, websites are given for viewers 
to find out more about fostering 
adopting 
children. 
“Instant 
Family” is a message movie, and 
it’s not a terribly subtle one.
There’s a cynical side of me 
that’s driven to criticize the film for 
this ham-fistedness — it’s the same 
side that’s led to my cementing a 
reputation as someone who likes 
to, or at least has a knack for, 
writing negative reviews — but 
if it’s cool with you, I’d like to do 
something different. Instead of 
lambasting “Instant Family” for 
its cheesiness, I’d like to focus on 
how fundamentally good-hearted 
it is, and how genuine emotion 
driven by strong performances 
and a terrific sense of humor earn 
it every ounce of its schmaltz.
So many films try and fail for 
this sort of touching story. They 
go their entire runtimes tossing 

out cheap, predictable emotional 
moments sandwiched between 
equally 
dull 
jokes. 
“Instant 
Family” director Sean Anders is 
no stranger to this, having helmed 
“Daddy’s Home 2” — a truly sad 
attempt at a Christmas comedy 
— but here he strikes gold. Where 
“Daddy’s Home 2” seemed nearly 
incapable of landing a punchline, 
“Instant 
Family” 
establishes 
early on that it knows how to set 
up a great joke and how to follow 

through with it. It may be too early 
to say that Anders learned from 
the mistakes of his earlier films, 
but at the very least, he’s clearly 
learned to let the jokes breathe 
and allow the chemistry between 
his performers to speak for itself.
Wahlberg and Byrne head up the 
cast and play off each other well. 
The relationship between them 
that forms the core of the movie is 
easy to believe as a result. There’s 
little 
time 
spent 
establishing 
them; we’re just thrown into their 
marriage and expected to follow 
along. The stand-out of the cast 
is Isabela Moner (“Sicario: Day of 
the Soldado”) as Lizzy, the oldest 
of the foster siblings Pete and Ellie 

adopt. Moner already proved that 
she can partially salvage even a 
flat script with her work in the 
“Sicario” sequel, and with the 
stronger script present in “Instant 
Family,” she shines in a role that 
finds her perfectly portraying 
a teenager who has been in the 
system long enough to become 
jaded by it. The young actress’s 
work in the past year alone has 
proven her to be a talent to watch 
as her career continues.
For 
all 
the 
well-deserved 
praise there is to be heaped upon 
the main cast, a word must be 
spared for the supporting players. 
Octavia Spencer (“The Shape of 
Water”) and Tig Notaro (“Dog 
Days”) play Karen and Sharon, 
the two social workers who help 
Pete and Ellie as they enter the 
world of foster parenting, and they 
both lend vibrant performances 
to 
characters 
that 
another 
script may have left devoid of 
personality. Here, they become 
comedic highlights of the film, 
an odd couple that never fails 
to get a laugh. As Pete’s mother 
Sandy, perpetual scene-stealer 
(and University alum!) Margo 
Martindale (“Sneaky Pete”) gets 
perhaps the most emotionally 
resonant moment of a film chock-
full of them. Everyone, onscreen 
and off, gives their all, and the 
finished product reflects that over 
and over again. “Instant Family” is 
a film with a goal, gooey edges and 
all; it’s a rousing, funny and deeply 
moving success.

FILM REVIEW

‘Instant Family’ is a fun 
and wholesome delight

In a recent interview with 
Vulture, rapper Earl Sweatshirt 
reflected on the sound of his 
most recent third studio album 
Some Rap Songs, stating that, 
“(the album) is infinitum. It’s 
the snake eating its tail.”
As the quote suggests, Some 
Rap Songs brings to mind 
an image of the ouroboros. 
Each song is built solely off of 
loops — segments of endlessly 
repeating 
warped 
beats, 
stripped-down instrumentals 
and muffled audio clips. Each 
track’s end eats the beginning 
of the next, creating a sort of 
timeless vacuum both within 
the 
songs 
themselves 
and 
within the album as a whole. 
In this nebula, Earl Sweatshirt 
floats, 
allowing 
his 
verses 
to 
unravel, 
free-form 
and 
purposefully 
off-beat. 
The 

resulting sound is markedly 
different 
from 
the 
sharp 
technical perfection of any 
of Earl’s past projects, yet to 
produce something polished 
doesn’t seem to be the point. 
Within 
the 
hypnotism 
of 
intense loops, Some Rap Songs 
constantly 
redefines 
itself, 
creating a layered meditation 
on where Earl Sweatshirt has 

been, on how he is now and 
on where he could go in the 
future.
In 
the 
ouroboros, 
it 
is 
impossible to arrive at the 
end without simultaneously 
stumbling upon the beginning. 
In 
the 
same 
sense, 
it 
is 
impossible to appraise this 

album without first looking 
back.
Earl Sweatshirt made his 
official debut in 2010 with the 
release of the “EARL” music 
video. “I got nuts to bust, 
and butts to fuck, and ups to 
shut / And sluts to fucking 
uppercut / It’s O-F, buttercup, 
go head, fuck with us,” he 
raps over scenes of him and 
other members of Odd Future 
(see: 
OFWGKTA) 
loitering 
around various locations in 
Los Angeles. Under a fisheye 
lens, they drink a suspiciously 
brown concoction that is equal 
parts 
prescription 
drugs, 
cough 
syrup, 
malt 
liquor 
and marijuana. They end up 
convulsing on the ground, 
foaming at the mouth and 
spitting 
up 
various 
bodily 
fluids. 
This 
offensively 
grotesque 
parody 
of 
body 
horror matches the insolence 
of 
the 
self-titled 
mixtape 
“EARL” emerged from. Here, 

verses barbed with hostility 
and cartoonish rowdiness land 
like punches to the gut.
Earl 
is 
aimlessly 
angry, 
pushing 
the 
boundary 
of 
social acceptability without 
any 
substance 
behind 
the 
drive. 
Yet, 
there 
was 
no 
denying Earl Sweatshirt’s skill 
— 
heavy-handed 
wordplay 
unpacking 
neatly, 
precise 
yet still unpredictable — and 
he 
soon 
caught 
attention, 
especially after disappearing 
shortly (spending a hiatus at 
a boarding school in Samoa) 
after Earl’s release, as the 
rest of Odd Future adopted 
“Free Earl!” into a rallying 
cry. In this absence, Earl 
Sweatshirt became a symbol 
that Odd Future used in part 
to catapult themselves further 
into the public sphere, an 
anarchic representation that 
was discordant to the Earl 
who ended up returning two 
years later to L.A. Within his 
time apart from Odd Future’s 
chaotic world, he found space 
to turn his attention inward, 
changing perspectives as he 
changed physical locations. 
Perhaps a result of this 
isolated period of discovery, 
or perhaps not, in between 
every 
single 
project 
Earl 
Sweatshirt has released — 
from Earl to 2013’s Doris to 
2015’s I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t 
Go Outside: An Album by Earl 
Sweatshirt to this year’s Some 
Rap Songs — there has been a 
progression: of technical skill, 
of self, of forms of expression. 
This growth is evident within 
Earl’s music. Doris dismantles 
Earl’s juvenile foundations and 
builds them anew, grounding 
songs in more personal subject 
matter 
and 
showcasing 
a 
greater variation in sound 
while still maintaining the 
dense, twisting, MF DOOM-
esque 
lyricism 
he 
became 
infamous for in 2010.
I Don’t Like Shit takes 
Doris’s 
eclecticism 
and 
flattens it, focusing inward. 
Sweeping samples and bright 
jazz-infused chords are made 
murky, 
transformed 
into 
fragmented 
instrumentation 
and muddled melodies — a dark 
backdrop that Earl cuts right 
through. Oftentimes rapping 
at a slower pace than he did 
on Doris or Earl, his words 
seem to be the biggest focus 
of I Don’t Like Shit, diving 
into his own psyche with a 
heaviness that was never quite 
as apparent before. If this was 
rock bottom, then Some Rap 
Songs arrives like the first 
breath of air after emerging 
from the waves. It cuts all 
the previous deadweight to 
effortlessly hang suspended: a 

masterwork of efficiency.
In the grand scheme of 
Earl 
Sweatshirt’s 
entire 
discography (save for 2015’s 
loosie “solace”), Some Rap 
Songs stands out as a kind 
of anomaly. Rather than the 
clean organization of bars 

delivered one on top of the 
next in staccato bursts, this 
album is more organic. It 
glitches; it hisses; it loops 
relentlessly over bars that 
aimlessly 
drift 
off 
into 
a 
multitude of directions. Take 
opener “Shattered Dreams” — 
the loop begins with a sample 
from author James Baldwin. 
“Imprecise words,” Baldwin 
states and the beat haltingly 
picks up, stumbling under the 
drawn-out fuzzy repetition of 
“dreams.” Beneath it all, Earl 
ambles 
into 
nonsequiturs, 
“Mask off, mask on, we trick-
or-treatin’ / Back off, stand-
offish and anemic / Yeah, my 
n***a Ish, told him it’s a feelin’ 
/ Blast off, buckshot into my 
ceilin’.” The result is a track 
that sinks into an introspective 
haze, and within its garbled 
notes, Earl taps into a nearly 
uncharacterizable sentiment: 
a yearning, a searching and a 
wistfulness for something just 
beyond reach.
This 
strange 
abstraction 
of mood and sound is due 
in part to Some Rap Songs’s 
collaborators. The crew of 
young artists who worked on 
the album with Earl — NYC 
rappers MIKE and Medhane, 
alongside 
rapper/producer 
Sixpress 
and 
innovative 
collective Standing on the 

Corner, 
among 
others 
— 
are all known for pushing 
experimental 
boundaries 
within 
their 
own 
music, 
splintering apart traditional 
aspects of jazz and hip hop 
in order to create a more 
unorthodox 
form 
of 
soul-
searching. “I be with Mike and 
Med / Nowadays I be with Sage 
and with Sixpress, ya dig?” Earl 
says on “Nowhere2Go,” and it’s 
easy to see the effect of these 
new relationships through the 
album’s preference for feeling 
over structure.
Most of the tracks on Some 
Rap Songs hold some kind 
of technical malfunction — 
Earl Sweatshirt’s raps don’t 
sit quite right on the looped 
sample of Soul Superiors’s 
1970 song “Trust In Me Baby” 
on “Ontheway!” and his verses 
in “Peanut” are chopped and 
layered so roughly it becomes 
difficult to discern the words — 
yet it is these very cracks in the 
album’s musical landscape that 
allows the underlying emotion 
to be so easily perceived. Much 
like J Dilla brought a human 
aspect to the mechanics of his 
programming, 
incorporating 
aspects of swing and groove 
into his hip-hop beats, the 
flaws on Some Rap Songs make 
the album feel more personable 
as 
the 
unfocused 
looping 
samples give Earl Sweatshirt 
an opportunity to wander into 
self-reflection. 
Some 
Rap 
Songs 
is 
an 
attempt 
to 
reconceive 
not 
only what kind of music Earl 
Sweatshirt creates but who 
exactly Earl Sweatshirt is. 
On “Playing Possums,” Earl 
stitches together recordings 
of an old speech his mother, 
Cheryl Harris, gave at UCLA 
and 
his 
recently 
deceased 
father, Keorapestse Kgositsile, 
reciting an excerpt from his 
poem, “Anguish Longer Than 
Sorrow.” “To my son Thebe,” 
we hear Harris say. “Cultural 
worker and student of life, 
whose growth and insights 
inspire 
me,” 
and 
in 
the 
background, Kgositsile slowly 
echoes, “For some children / 
Words like home / Could not 
carry any possible meaning 
/ But / Displaced / Border / 
Refugee.” It is an effort to 
reconcile two very strained 
familial 
relationships, 
and 
although 
Kgositsile 
passed 
away before he could hear it, 
the intent behind “Playing 
Possums” 
still 
remains 
strongly rooted within the 
framework of Some Rap Songs: 
a cathartic letter addressed 
in the form of music, bringing 
with it the belief that there 
is always a chance to rebuild 
anew again.

Doing it the hard way

EVANSTON — Maybe it was 
just a slip of the tongue.
A 
minute 
into his press 
conference, 
trying to sum 
up 
a 
game 
in which his 
team played 
above its level 
yet still came 
up 
short, 
Northwestern 
coach 
Chris 
Collins 
offered the kind of statement you 
couldn’t have imagined anyone 
saying about Michigan a month ago.
“We still fight back,” Collins 
said. “We take the lead, get it to 
the last two minutes against what 
a lot of you feel is the best team in 
the country.”
And, after a ninth-straight 
win to start the season for the 

Wolverines, that wasn’t all that 
surprising a thing to say.
Tuesday was the worst game 
Michigan has played this season. 
It suffered scoreless stretches in 
which its best offensive answer 
was junior point guard Zavier 
Simpson chucking a 3-pointer, on 
which he was 0-for-5. It struggled 
to contain Dererk Pardon, who 
scored 20 points on 9-of-10 
shooting with five rebounds as 
a result. When junior center 
Jon Teske was off the floor, the 
Wolverines struggled to contain 
pretty much everyone. In the 
waning minutes of a close game, 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
went to sophomore Eli Brooks 
to run point — not Simpson, the 
team’s heart and soul.
And yet, when the clock read 
zeroes, the Wolverines had beaten 
the Wildcats, 62-60. In that 
sense, Tuesday’s was the most 

impressive game Michigan has 
played thus far.
This was on the road, in the Big 
Ten, with a hostile crowd, in a late, 
close game against an opponent 
who had beaten the Wolverines 
every time the two played in its 
building since 2013. It’s the type 
of game Michigan could get away 
with losing and given the way 
Michigan played, it’s the type of 
game it should have lost.
Last year, it was a game the 
Wolverines did lose. A year 
ago to the day, Michigan went 
to Columbus and coughed up 
a 20-point lead, unable to stop 
the Buckeyes’ sea of momentum 
once they got rolling. There was 
nobody it could trust in that spot 
and when adversity came, things 
fell apart.
This year?
“We didn’t get scrambled,” said 
sophomore guard Jordan Poole. 

“I feel like a team can easily get 
scrambled being in a situation 
like this for the first time, but we 
had a lot of vets out there on the 
court. Guys who had been in this 
situation last year. We didn’t get 
rattled. We were just executing.”
After Northwestern pulled into 
the lead for the first time, with 
6:32 to go in the game, Brooks 
and freshman forward Ignas 
Brazdeikis hit 3-pointers on back-
to-back possessions to take it right 
back.
After the Wildcats tied it again 
with just over two minutes to go, 
Poole cruised into the lane and 

threw down a hammer.
And after the offense failed 
to execute in the game’s final 
minute 
— 
redshirt 
junior 
Charles Matthews traveling and 
Northwestern forcing a shot clock 
violation — the Wolverines bore 
down and forced a desperation 
3-pointer from Ryan Taylor at the 
buzzer.
At 
some 
point 
amid 
the 
preceding run from the Wildcats, 
Simpson told the team to calm 
down. It wasn’t necessary.
“He didn’t have to say calm 
down,” 
Poole 
said, 
“cause 
everybody’s already calm.”

Michigan is relatively young, 
without a senior on its roster, but 
it carries the experience of last 
year’s Final Four run — in droves. 
Save for Brazdeikis, everyone on 
the floor as the game wound down 
had faced situations a whole lot 
tougher than Welsh-Ryan Arena 
on a Tuesday.
As for the freshman, who led 
the team in scoring with 23 points, 
there was no ambiguity.
“We can go all the way,” 
Brazdeikis said. “We can win the 
whole damn thing. No doubt.”
At this point, it’s hard to argue 
otherwise.

‘M’ escapes Northwestern with 62-60 win

EVANSTON — For 23 minutes, it 
looked like it was going to be easy.
Then, the No. 5 Michigan men’s 
basketball team (2-0 Big Ten, 9-0 
overall) inexplicably met its biggest 
challenge in a season that has 
included three double-digit wins 
over ranked opponents, just before 
escaping with a 62-60 win.
Northwestern — trailing 45-30 
with 16:13 to play — broke off seven 
quick points to cut the Wolverines’ 
lead to eight. Michigan, though, was 
used to that. Both North Carolina 
and Purdue made second half mini-
runs without ever really threatening 
the Wolverines.
“Every other team that has 
played this team,” said Wildcats 
coach Chris Collins, “when they 
made a push on them, like they did 
to get to 15 points, every other team 
has laid down and lost by 25 or 30.”
So when freshman forward 
Ignas Brazdeikis hit a layup to break 
Michigan’s drought, most assumed 
that the Wolverines would roll for 
the rest of the evening.
But before anyone had time 
to digest that assumption, the 
Wildcats got an and-one, followed 
by a pair of baskets off turnovers. 
Then, another and-one.
As Michigan coach John Beilein 
signaled for a timeout, the crowd at 
Welsh-Ryan Arena — or at least, the 
purple-clad half of it — rose to a fever 
pitch, temporarily transforming 

into a standing-room-only venue.
Brazdeikis — who finished with 
a game-high 23 points — and junior 
guard Zavier Simpson hit back-to-
back baskets for the Wolverines 
to briefly placate the storm, but 
the rest of the night was far from 
comfortable for Michigan.
With 6:33 to play, Northwestern 
guard Vic Law pulled up for his 
second 3-point attempt in a row. 
Just like the previous one, it 
found nothing but nylon, putting 
the Wildcats up, 52-51 — the 
Wolverines’ first second half deficit 
since Nov. 10 against Holy Cross.
“The shots that Law was making 
and (Ryan) Taylor made, they were 
tough shots,” Beilein said. “It wasn’t 
like he was getting open, he created 
all those NBA (shots).”
Added Brazdeikis: “They were 
hitting shots when we weren’t. I felt 
like we had a bunch of open shots 
in the second half, and they weren’t 
falling. And then they started to hit 
crazy shots.”
That 
three, 
combined 
with 
Michigan’s ongoing five-minute 
scoring drought, prompted Beilein 
to make an unusual change, 
replacing Simpson with sophomore 
guard Eli Brooks.
Simpson 
was 
among 
the 
Wolverines’ most important players 
in the early going, with eight first-
half points. But Collins’ defense 
adjusted at halftime, playing off 
Simspon and forcing him to beat 
them from 3-point range. And 
when Simpson responded by going 

0-for-5 from three, Beilein called on 
Brooks.
Brooks — after a Brazdeikis 
three tied the game — rewarded his 
coach’s faith by hitting a three to 
restore Michigan’s lead.
“They were just daring (Simpson) 
to shoot,” Beilein said. “And as a 
result, we ran with Eli. We got faith 
in him. Eli’s a good defender. He’s 
an above-average defender, Zavier 
is a spectacular defender. So we’re 
giving up something, but we needed 
to get something from somebody 
and he gave it.”
From there, the teams traded 
baskets. After Brooks’ three, it 
was Brazdeikis with a free throw. 
Then junior center Jon Teske and 
sophomore guard Jordan Poole 
with a pair of easy dunks.
But with each Michigan basket 
that seemed to shift momentum 
back to the Wolverines’ sideline, 
the Wildcats conjured a response. 
Brazdeikis’ free throw was the 
only time in the last 11:30 that 
Northwestern didn’t respond with a 
basket of its own.
So, despite a late flurry of points, 
Michigan was unable to extend its 
lead beyond one possession.
When 
a 
Wildcat 
offensive 
foul granted the Wolverines the 
opportunity to do so, redshirt 
junior forward Charles Matthews 
promptly responded with a traveling 
violation. On its next possession — 
with a two-point lead and under 
a minute to play — Michigan had 
yet another opportunity to put the 
game to bed after a pair of clutch 
defensive rebounds. This time, 
it was a shot-clock violation that 
undid the Wolverines, offering 
Northwestern a final possession 
with 14.2 seconds to play.
Then, Michigan’s stifling defense 
— absent for so much of the second 
half — showed why it has been 
lauded as the nation’s best when it 
mattered most.
It forced the Wildcats into a 
desperation heave at the buzzer that 
smacked off the backboard, cladded 
the front of the rim and bounced 
harmlessly to the floor as the 
Wolverines — somehow — escaped 
with their perfect record intact.
“I knew we were gonna have to 
go through games like this if we’re 
gonna be good,” Beilein said.
“And we survived it. I don’t know 
how.”

What will Michigan make of its season?

There’s really no other way 
to spin it: 
picking up 
only one 
point last 
weekend 
against 
a reeling 
Michigan 
State team is 
embarrass-
ing.
From top 
to bottom, 
there needs to be a sense of 
urgency from the No. 15 Michi-
gan hockey team. There is no 
questioning the fight the team 
displayed over the weekend 
— 
but even though the individual 
effort was there, the results 
were not.
In order to be one of the 
best teams in the country as 
they showed they could be last 
season, the Wolverines need 
to find ways to win. After both 
games last weekend, Michigan 
coach Mel Pearson emphasized 

the need for his team to be able 
to grind out a game.
“We’re going to have to learn 
to play in games like this,” 
Pearson said on Friday. “It’s not 
going to be up and down hock-
ey every night. We’re going to 
have to stop, start, grind it out, 
keep it simple and then find a 
way to win games.”
Michigan has the talent level 
on its roster to be among col-
lege hockey’s elite. There are 
nine NHL draft picks on the 
team — just four other pro-
grams have more — including 
two first-round selections, sec-
ond only to Boston University’s 
four.
The Wolverines have shown 
flashes all season long. They 
matched a high-powered Penn 
State offense in Happy Valley — 
scoring 12 goals in two games 
— and duked it out against a 
defensive-minded Notre Dame 
team (save for a disastrous sec-
ond period in the 6-2 blowout). 
But inconsistencies continue 

to plague the team as though 
Moses himself is still looking to 
prove a point.
Speaking of that second 
period against Notre Dame, 
it is a prime example of the 
team’s inconsis-
tency. Michigan 
gave up three 
goals in a span of 
three minutes to 
begin the period 
— a period that 
senior captain 
Joseph Cecconi 
called “embar-
rassing” — and 
allowed one 
more before 
going into the second inter-
mission. Outside of the sec-
ond period of that game, they 
matched, if not outplayed, the 
fifth-ranked Fighting Irish — 
outscoring Notre Dame, 4-3.
The Wolverines are reach-
ing the pivotal halfway point 
of their season, marked by the 
annual Great Lakes Invita-

tional Tournament that takes 
place Dec. 30 and 31. As far 
as results go, they currently 
find themselves in a state of 
mediocrity — two points away 
from the bottom of the Big Ten 
standings and 
dropping eleven 
spots from 
their preseason 
No. 4 ranking. 
Remember, 
only the top-16 
ranked teams go 
on to the NCAA 
Tournament.
Last year, 
the Wolverines 
were 7-7-2 going 
into the GLI Tournament. A 
strikingly similar record to this 
season’s 6-6-3 with a series 
against Minnesota — one of 
three teams tied at the bottom 
of the conference standings — 
still remaining before the two-
game tournament begins.
“There’s no doubt about it,” 
Pearson said after Saturday’s 

game. “We were in a very simi-
lar situation last year. Can we 
come out of that funk? This 
weekend will be a good chance 
for us to right the ship and go 
home for a few days in a good 
mood. We’ll be ready to go this 
weekend.”
Last season, the GLI marked 
a turning point of sorts for the 
Wolverines. They rattled off 11 
wins in their next 16 regular-
season games, climbing to No. 
10 in the rankings after being 
unranked at the end of the GLI 
Tournament.
If last year is any indica-
tion, anything can happen this 
season. And though there is no 
uphill climb to make it into the 
rankings this year, Michigan is 
instead battling with a slippery 
slope, trying to cling to its top-
16 spot.
Senior defenseman Joseph 
Cecconi addressed the team 
after their loss on Saturday, 
reestablishing the team’s 
expectations and emphasizing 

the effort and buy-in needed 
on a daily basis. He made the 
decision to return to Ann Arbor 
instead of joining the Dallas 
Stars. Sophomore defenseman 
Quinn Hughes also opted to 
return in lieu of beginning a 
promising NHL career in Van-
couver. The defensive pairing 
— along with the other seven 
NHL draftees on the roster 
— clearly saw the potential to 
make another deep tournament 
run. There’s still half a season 
before that run is even a pos-
sibility.
Though the season is far 
from over, whether Michigan 
can find consistency and have a 
second-half push similar to last 
season remains to be seen.
And so, it’s time for the team 
to take a long look in the mir-
ror and decide what it wants to 
make of its season.

statement

THE MICHIGAN DAILY | DECEMBER 5, 2018


I

’ve 
never 
written 
about 
sex 
before. It’s always 
felt like a breach 
of some invisible 
social contract, like 
a taboo topic tip-
toed around euphe-
mistically because 
we can’t talk about 
the 
details: 
It’s 
too personal, too 
vulnerable, 
too 
awkward for your 
grandmother 
to 
hear you wrote an 
article about hook-
ing up. I’ve always 
thrown sex into the 
category of things 
beyond my scope 
of personal, opin-
ionated 
expertise, 
like foreign policy 
or Major League 
Baseball or classical 
music.
Let me preface 
this with the fact 
that I do not write. My job at The Mich-
igan Daily is to edit: I proofread and 
fact check, suggest and question. But 
in terms of generating content, I leave 
my opinions unsaid. Armed with 
the words of others, I am free to 
wholeheartedly participate in the 
world of journalism without bar-
ing an inch of my soul. All without 
being the slightest bit exposed — 
no byline with my name and no 
picture. I do not write. And I most 
certainly do not write about sex.
But I’ve been in college for three 
years now and it occurred to me 
that maybe I do have something to 
say. Maybe there is room beyond 
the silence, beyond the closed 
lips, beyond the texts I have typed 
and deleted, just past whispers of 
friends and sharp turns I’ve taken to 
avoid him, to avoid you, to avoid myself. 
There is all the space in the world to 
say what I want to say.
It takes courage to share our stories. 
It takes bravery to share our trauma, 

our regrets, our mistakes and our suc-
cesses. It is one of the hardest things 
in the world to be honest. As an editor, 
I’ve had the privilege to read so many 
accounts of honesty: Passionate opin-
ions, personal narratives, coverage of 
tragedies and triumphs. The mundane 
and the unusual, the wins and the loss-
es.
I am going to write that sex in col-
lege is not what I expected. Hookup 
culture, to me, has been a source of 
intangible, undefinable confusion. I 
have gotten by without much thought. 
I haven’t been in danger, or in love. I 
have played my part in the chaos, at the 
frat parties, at the bar, in the middle of 
the night. I have lied and been lied to, I 
have rejected and been rejected, I have 
stomached disappointment and an 
extra drink. I have snuck home in the 
morning and called my mother. 
I don’t write, but I am a writer. And 
I’m not a born communicator: In fact, 
I’m an expert in avoidance. A lot of us 
are. What strikes me about hookup 
culture is how deeply removed we’ve 
become from our truths. I am 21 and 
just learning how to say what I mean. 
My mom always told me I’d never be in 
a relationship until I stopped looking 
over my shoulder every time I make a 
decision. I always told her it wouldn’t 
matter here. But I have to learn how to 
write what I’m thinking, how to leave 
something unedited and unfinished.
There is a lot of noise. There are a 
lot of layers. I was always the one in 
high school turning down the music at 
parties so I could hear you speak more 
clearly. I was always one to want what 
I couldn’t have. That has been my big-
gest flaw. I could never articulate per-
fectly what I was feeling, so I didn’t say 
anything. I was never 100 percent sure 
about foreign policy, or baseball, or 
music or sex, so I never spoke up at all.
I think we forget that people are lis-
tening. I forget I’m always staying just 
10 more minutes at the bar because I 
have more to say. I’m always forget-
ting that I know how to be myself. I’m 
an editor: always cutting things out, 
always fixing your mistakes. I don’t 
write about sex. Maybe I’ll learn how 
to.

most certainly do not

I

n this issue of The State-
ment 
Magazine, 
we’re 
talking about sex. But to 
get a comprehensive view of the 
campus sexual landscape, we 
can’t simply rely on anecdotes 
and personal experiences. In 
an effort to get some quantita-
tive information about student 
sexual activity, The Daily anon-
ymously surveyed 11,000 ran-
domly-selected students abouwt 
their experiences and percep-
tions of sex.
The survey received 1,409 
responses, 
with 
respondents 
spread evenly across undergrad-
uate grade levels. The respon-
dents were 55.4 percent female, 
43.1 percent male and 1.5 per-
cent identifying as nonbinary 
or “other.” They were also 83.3 
percent heterosexual, 4.5 per-
cent homosexual and 9.3 percent 
bisexual. It should be noted the 
statistics resulting from this sur-
vey may be biased, as many indi-
viduals may not wish to disclose 
such information.
The survey questions covered 
several areas, including percep-
tions of sex (both in general and 
on campus), sex education and 
personal experience. Some nota-
ble statistics and trends emerged 
from the responses.
To begin broadly, students 
shared differing perceptions of 
what “sex” is. While there was 
broad (97.3 percent) agreement 
that penetrative sex qualifies as 
sex, 47.8 percent of students also 
considered oral sex to be sex, and 
33.7 percent considered any kind 
of genital contact to be sex.
Students also reported differ-
ing definitions of “hooking up.” 
In total, 75 percent of students 
included oral sex and penetra-
tive sex in their definitions, and 
67.8 percent included other geni-
tal contact. Notably, 58 percent 
included making out in their 
definitions.
By these personal definitions, 
a total of 65.2 percent of stu-
dents reported having sex during 
this semester, with 28.5 percent 
reporting that they had sex once 
or twice per month or less and 
21.5 percent reporting that they 
had sex an average of once or 
twice per week. Students also 
proved to be relatively prescient 
about their peers’ sexual habits, 
as 50.7 percent of respondents 
estimated that between 60 and 
80 percent of students had sex 
this semester.

A total of 61.9 percent of stu-
dents said they had had mostly 
positive sexual experiences in 
college, and a total of 77.8 per-
cent of respondents agreed that 
they felt comfortable discussing 
sexual topics with friends.
Students also reported using 
dating apps at significant rates. 
The most commonly used dating 
app was Tinder, with 47.8 percent 
of respondents saying they use it. 
The next highest was Bumble, 
with 20.6 percent reporting 
they use it. However, most stu-
dents using these apps reported 
they don’t use them to actively 
look for partners. A majority of 
57.7 percent of students who use 
dating apps use them primar-
ily for casual browsing — that is, 
without the primary intention of 

finding a partner. Most students 
had used the internet for sexual 
activity, and a total of 57.3 per-
cent of students reported they 
had sent a nude photo or received 
one from someone they knew.
Responding to a question 
about contraception, 73.8 per-
cent of students named condoms 
as a preferred method of contra-
ception, and 51.3 percent named 
birth control pills. Intrauter-
ine devices were chosen by 16.4 
percent, and withdrawal (also 
known as “pulling out”) and 
abstinence were each chosen by 
15.8 percent of students.
The data also revealed some 
subtle differences in sexual atti-
tudes by gender. For example, 
women were 13.8 percentage 
points more likely than men to 

say they were comfortable open-
ly discussing sexual topics with 
friends. And when it comes to 
using dating apps, women were 
21.2 percentage points more like-
ly to be using the apps primarily 
for casual browsing. Men were 
6.8 percentage points more likely 
to be looking for a relationship on 
these apps and 16.2 percentage 
points more likely to be looking 
to hook up.
Men were also less likely to 
consider most sexual activity to 
be “hooking up,” with the excep-
tion of penetrative sex, which 
had similar perceptions among 
men and women.
There were also notable dif-
ferences in experience by sexual 
orientation. For instance, gay 
and lesbian students were about 

twice as likely as other students 
to have had five or more sexual 
partners in college. The data also 
revealed some troubling differ-
ences between students of differ-
ent sexual orientations. Straight 
students were 10.4 percent more 
likely than bisexual students to 
say that they had mostly posi-
tive sexual experiences in col-
lege. Gay and lesbian students 
fell in the middle of these groups. 
(It should be noted that majori-
ties of all three groups reported 
mostly positive experiences).
In the free response section, 
which asked several general 
questions about sex and relation-
ships, responses varied wide-
ly but followed some general 
trends. In response to the ques-
tion “What is the worst thing 
to hear from your partner after 
sex?”, the most common response 
by a significant margin was a 
comment that the experience 
was negative or underwhelming 
for the partner. Other frequent 
responses included rude, dis-
missive or uncaring comments. 
Asked about their favorite post-
sex activity, responses consis-
tently included activities such as 
cuddling, talking, sleeping, eat-
ing and showering.
For the question “What sug-
gestions would you like to give 
to your current sexual part-
ner?”, respondents frequently 
expressed a desire for better 
communication from their part-
ner. Other frequent answers 
included requests for more sex-
ual attention and a desire to be 
more adventurous in sexual rela-
tionships.
Students also expressed a gen-
eral dissatisfaction with the sex 
education they received. Asked 
about what they wished they 
knew about sex when they were 
younger, most students said they 
wished they had a more com-
prehensive view of sexual activ-
ity. Many students said they had 
abstinence-only sex education 
in school and that it left them 
unprepared for sexual situations, 
as well as uninformed about con-
sent and safe sex. Many also said 
that their sexual education most-
ly just covered basic anatomical 
information about sex. These 
students generally wished that 
they learned more about healthy 
sexual relationships, emotional 
aspects of sex, gender dynamics 
and unhealthy societal percep-
tions about sex.

F

or LSA seniors Sarah Costello 
and Kayla Kaszyca, it was best 
friendship at first sight. Sarah 
and Kayla were roommates freshman 
year, randomly placed together in Alice 
Lloyd Residence Hall. They’ve lived 
together ever since, save for summers 
and a semester Sarah spent in Germany.
“We 
just 
happened 
to 
get 
each 
other,” 
Sarah 
explained.
“Week 
one, 
we 
were 
like, 
‘We’re 
in 
love!’” 
Kayla 
joked.
“By day two we were like, ‘Oh! We’re 
already best friends!’” Sarah added.
Their three-and-a-half years of friend-
ship have created countless inside jokes 
and an easy intimacy — as well as a week-
ly podcast, which now has more than 
60 episodes. The subject of this podcast 
is sexuality, specifically asexuality and 
demisexuality. It’s grown to have an 
impressive following: about 1,000 listens 
per week and roughly 25,000 total listens.
D

uring their freshman year, 
Sarah and Kayla didn’t really 
talk much about sexuality. 
Sarah was still figuring out her sexuality, 
and it wasn’t until the summer after fresh-
man year that she came out as asexual.
Asexuality is the absence of sexual 
attraction. People who are asexual, oth-
erwise known as “ace,” simply do not 
feel sexual attraction toward any gender. 
Sarah identifies as aromantic asexual, or 
“aro-ace,” meaning that she isn’t inter-
ested in romantic or sexual relationships.
“The summer after freshman year, I 
found out Sarah was asexual — she made 
a post on Tumblr and I followed her Tum-
blr,” Kayla recounted with her friend. 
The three of us were crowded around 
a small table in the lobby of the UgLi. 
Murmured homework questions and 
shouted coffee orders from Bert’s provid-
ed a steady stream of background noise.
“It wasn’t even a post about coming out,” 
Sarah clarified. “It was an ‘about me’ post.”
“So I saw and I messaged her and I was 
like, 
‘Hey, 
I 
saw 
this,’ 
and 
she 
was 
like, 
‘Cool,’ 
and I was like, ‘Cool!’ And that was it.”
The podcast, which the pair named 

“Sounds Fake But Okay,” grew out of 
conversations between Sarah and Kayla 
about sexuality during their junior 
year. These discussions about the diver-
sity of sexual attraction led to Kayla’s 
realization that she is demisexual.
People 
who 
are 
demisexual, 
or 
“demi,” 
only experi-
ence sexual 
attraction 
after 
form-
ing an emo-
tional bond 
with 
their 
potential 
partner. 
Kayla began 
to 
suspect 
she 
might 
be demisex-
ual 
dur-
ing her junior year, but she was in 
a 
committed 
relationship 
with 
a 
man at the time and so it didn’t feel 
urgent for her to define her sexuality.
However, after Kayla’s relationship 
with her boyfriend ended, her demisexu-
ality became much more evident to her. 
Casual sex had never appealed to her, and 
demisexuality just made sense. It feels like 
less of a big deal for her to be demisexual 
as a woman, she explained, because soci-
ety already expects women to need an 
emotional connection for sex. Some peo-
ple confuse demisexuality with the choice 
to wait for an emotional commitment 
before sex, but just as asexuality isn’t the 
same as celibacy, demisexual people are 
different from those who make an active 
decision to postpone sexual activity.
Kayla remembered the intensity of 
recording the January 2018 episode about 
her realization that she is demisexual.
“I made Sarah very uncomfortable 
(by crying), because Sarah doesn’t do 
emotions in general — which is a stereo-
type (about asexual people),” Kayla said.
“Not because I’m ace,” Sarah clari-

fied. “Because I’m my father’s daughter.”
“I was saying how much the pod-
cast has helped me realize things about 
myself, and how Sarah has been there 
for me throughout, helping me under-
stand and teaching me things,” Kayla 
said. “I got very emotional.”
Most of the episodes of 
 
“Sounds Fake But Okay” 
are inspired by Sarah and 
Kayla’s 
own 
experienc-
es. For example, the duo 
recorded an episode about 
ace exclusion from the 
LGBTQ+ community after 
a high school classmate 
of Sarah’s — who identi-
fies as queer — tweeted on 
the subject, expressing his 
opinion that asexual peo-
ple should not be included 
in the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity. Sarah explained that 
acephobia(discrimination 
against asexual people) often comes 
from within the LGBTQ+ community.
“Sarah 
was 
livid,” 
Kayla 
said. 
“I 
was 
also 
very 
angry.”
“I was just upset because I really liked 
this (classmate) as a person,” Sarah added, 
“And I was like, ‘You’re a part of the 
queer community, how can you be doing 
this?’ So that was an angry episode.”
The 
classmate 
messaged 
Kayla 
after listening to their episode on ace 
exclusion to apologize for his tweet.
“I think he kind of got it a little bit more 
after that,” Kayla said. “In that episode, 
we did a lot of explaining about why the 
ace community deserves to be in the queer 
community. A lot of people’s basis (for ace 
exclusion) is, ‘Well, you don’t receive as 
much discrimination so you shouldn’t 
belong’… There should be no barriers 
to entry (into the queer community).”
“It’s a harmful way of thinking, to be 
like, ‘You have to have experienced horri-
ble, horrible things or else you can’t be part 
of this community,’” Sarah agreed. “I will 
acknowledge that in general, the ace com-
munity has had, especially on a systemic 

level, less discrimination than the gay 
community and the trans community.”
For example, no one has ever tried to 
stop asexual people from being able to 
marry — but then again, many aces don’t 
want to marry if they’re also aromantic. 
Some asexual people are homoromantic, 
Sarah explained, but they face discrimi-
nation because of their same-sex roman-
tic orientation, not their asexuality.
“Asexual people have existed for-
ever, but it was only recently that 
it became a community,” she said.
“There’s still a lot of discrimina-
tion (against asexual people),” Kayla 
said. “Maybe that stuff isn’t as bad 
as 
what’s 
happening 
to 
gay 
peo-
ple or trans people, but that doesn’t 
take away the fact that it happens.”
Sarah described “corrective” rape 
as one such issue aces often face. “Cor-
rective” rape is when sexual assault 
is intended to “fix” a perceived sexual 
deviance, such as same-sex attrac-
tion or, in the case of asexual people, 
a lack of sexual desire toward anyone.
As an aro-ace college student, Sarah 
sometimes worries that her friendli-
ness might be taken as flirtation. She 
explained that she tries to be careful not 
to insinuate romantic or sexual inter-
est, but that she hasn’t had too many 
awkward situations arise since most 
of her friends know that she’s asexual.
“If they follow me on Twitter, they 
probably know I’m ace,” she said.
“And if they like you, they’re gonna 
follow you on Twitter,” Kayla joked.
“Exactly!” 
Sarah 
laughed. 
“My 
Twitter’s 
great!”
Though Sarah and Kayla’s friends 
and family have been accepting of their 
sexualities, society still has a ways to 
go in accepting and respecting the dif-
ferent patterns of sexual attraction.
“A lot of people make judgment calls 
on asexuality when they don’t really 
understand it,” Sarah explained. “Part 
of the reason why we started the pod-
cast is because we wanted to help 
other people understand asexuality.”

A BRIEF HISTORY OF SEX ISSUE COVERS

The first Statement Sex Issue ran in December 2012, with a cover piece about 
gay cruising in Ann Arbor. This would turn into an annual feature that has now 
run into its seventh year.

At 11:30 PM last night, 
after making the paper, 
The 
Michigan 
Daily 
senior class traveled an 
hour North to Davisburg, 
Michigan. Every year, 
the seniors get a tour of 
the Michigan Web Press 
where our papers are 
printed. We got to see 
the process from start 
to finish, from the first 
proof to the bounded 
stacks of newspaper.
