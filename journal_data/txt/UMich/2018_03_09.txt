ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN YEARS OF EDITORIAL FREEDOM

The University of Michigan 

has pledged not to disclose 
immigration 
status 
of 
its 

students. 
However, 
once 

undocumented students at the 
University graduate, the future 
is hazy. This is especially true 
with those receiving Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals, 
DACA, which can be renewed 
every two years. One of DACA’s 
many benefits is its authorization 
of work permits, but with the 
uncertainty surrounding DACA 
in the government, the ability to 
legally work after graduation is 
no longer guaranteed.

This is something Engineering 

senior 
Javier 
Contreras 
is 

thinking about as he approaches 
graduation.

“This constant state of limbo 

and uncertainty is taking a great 
toll on a lot of my classmates and 
I,” Contreras said. “Just because 
we have enough to be stressed 

with. Myself, graduating this 
April, if I can’t legally work in the 
U.S., there goes my engineering 
degree. It is just a lot to think 
about.”

When these students’ DACA 

statuses expire, so does the 
eligibility for a work permit that 
comes with it, and the possibility 
of pursuing a salaried career in 
the country in which they got 
their degree disappears. DACA 
recipients can find a part-time 
job right before their DACA 
status expires, but once it does, 
they have to find a way to be paid 
under the table. Public Policy 
junior Yvonne Navarrete has 
peers currently navigating this 
struggle.

“I have friends who are 

undocumented 
and 
they’re 

seniors, ready to go into the 
workforce 
but 
their 
DACA 

expires 
in 
the 
summer,” 

Navarette said. “So they can 
only work for two months and 
then they don’t have work 
authorization. So then they 
would have to find a job that 
pays in cash. But what kind of 

“There goes 
my degree”: 
DACA and 
graduation

COMMUNITY AFFAIRS

Amid increasing uncertainty with ICE, 
students consider extending education

Diversity programs see increased effectiveness when partnered with student organizations

In line with Diversity, Equity 

and Inclusion plan’s overarching 
strategy to “recruit, retain and 
develop a diverse community,” 
the University of Michigan is 
increasing efforts to reach into 
the K-12 distribution across the 
state and attract a wider variety 
of applicants to the University. 
However, the task of letting 
potential applicants know about 

the University’s efforts requires 
more than just administrative 
initiatives; student organizations 
are also working to connect lower-
socioeconomic schools to the 
University and make a University 
of Michigan degree attainable.

CEO and DEI Partnership
Cited in the DEI plan as a 

K-12-focused body, the Center for 
Educational Outreach was given 
the responsibility of serving as 
the campus-wide K-12 Outreach 
Hub by extending the presence 
of the University across the 
state, 
providing 
training 
for 

students and faculty working 
with community partners and 
improving the University’s overall 
capacity. As the DEI plan enters its 
second year of implementation on 
campus, CEO hopes to continue 
improving upon their relatively 
new initiatives.

William 
Collins, 
executive 

director of the CEO, outlined the 
history of the center, which was 
established in 2008 as a result 
of former University President 
Mary Sue Coleman’s efforts to 
create a more diverse community 
on campus. Collins highlighted 

some of the CEO’s main goals: 
Familiarizing all parts of the state 
with the University, encouraging 
collaboration between outreach 
groups 
on 
campus 
and 

providing services for these K-12 
communities.

“Its purpose was to, first of 

all, expand the footprint of the 
University of Michigan around 
the state and more parts of the 
state would become familiar with 
the University and what we do,” 
Collins said. “To synergize efforts 
on campus that try to get different

Double-check: DEI initiatives for 
K-12 schools assisted by students

Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, an 

organizer and assistant professor 
of African American Studies at 
Princeton University, has never 
shied away from lambasting 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
in 

public speeches. After delivering 
the commencement address at 
Hampshire College last year, 
however, she received dozens 
of death threats, forcing her to 
cancel other speeches.

But she did not stay away from 

speeches for long. On Thursday 
evening, 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan’s Sociology Department 
hosted Taylor to discuss her recent 
book and her research on race and 
class in the Trump era to a crowd 
of about 150 people. Taylor was 
introduced as one of the hundreds 
of people who have recently 
refused to be silenced, from the 
#BlackLivesMatter movement to 
the #MeToo movement.

Taylor’s 
book, 
“From 

#BlackLivesMatter 
to 
Black 

Liberation,” examines the social 
movements that have stemmed 
in response to police brutality in 
the United States, and received 
the Lannan Foundation Cultural 
Freedom Award for an Especially 
Notable Book in 2016. 

Taylor 
said 
she 
considers 

herself more of an organizer 
than an academic, and admitted 
it took her publisher several tries 
to persuade her to write this book. 
Since its publication, however, the 
book has reached and impacted 

many students, including those in 
attendance. 

Having been an organizer for 

several years herself, Social Work 
student Kristina Agbebiyi said she 
sees Taylor as a role model.

“Seeing how she is able to 

balance organizing and academia 
really is inspiring to me,” Agbebiyi 
said.

Taylor 
began 
her 
talk 

comparing headlines today with 
those of ten years ago, starting with 
President Obama’s inauguration. 
 

She recalled headlines claiming 
the U.S. was entering a post-racial 

society –– “Racism No Longer 
Exists in America,” for example 
–– and noted the stark contrast to 
society and headlines today, with 
numerous outbreaks of violence 
and 
racism 
since 
Trump’s 

inauguration.

Taylor 
argued 
Trump’s 

controversial comments are not 
simply a slip of the tongue, but are 
rather calculated steps to appeal 
to his followers. Citing a tweet 
in which David Duke, a former 
grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, 
thanked Trump for his sympathy 
toward 
white 
supremacists 

marching 
in 
Charlottesville, 

Va., Taylor said Trump himself 
embraced white supremacy.

“The racist right celebrated 

their mouthpiece in the White 
House,” she said.

She 
also 
examined 
the 

evolution of racism in U.S. politics, 
and how it has transitioned from 
explicit racial slurs to a more 
subtle attack, through implicit 
comments and unjust economic 
policies. 

“With each racist comment, 

the Republican party meets it 

The University of Michigan’s 

Lecturers’ Employee Organization 
held a community forum at its 
offices 
Thursday 
night 
with 

about 27 student and tenure-track 
allies and community activists to 
discuss its bargaining negotiations 
with the University.

LEO, the union of non-tenure 

track lecturers for all three U-M 
campuses, has been bargaining 
with the University since October 
for 
higher 
wages, 
improved 

benefits 
and 
job 
security. 

Currently, the minimum salary 
for a Lecturer I is $34,500 for the 
Ann Arbor campus, $28,300 in 
Dearborn and $27,300 in Flint.

LEO President, Ian Robinson, 

a sociology lecturer, began by 
explaining the gravity of the 
situation during the bargaining 
process.

“The most basic thing to say 

about our platform is that it’s not 
business as usual,” Robinson said. 
“What we’re really saying this 
time around is we need to change 
from a mode where basically 
our pay has been determined, 
as far as the administration is

residents convened Thursday 
evening at the Ann Arbor 
District Library to discuss 
civic engagement and hear 
from a panel of local leaders 
in a community forum focused 
on the state of civic life in 
Washtenaw County.

Mary Morgan, founder of 

the CivCity Initiative, a local 
organization

to 

increase civic participation, 
moderated 
a 
panel 
about 

the 
importance 
of 
civic

and 
ways 
to

from 

Washtenaw residents.

Several residents expressed 

concerns about the low level 
of 
participation 
from 
Ann 

Arbor citizens in local politics. 
Many residents feel they have 
little power and their opinions 
wouldn’t be heard. Patrick 
Campion, the program director 
for

Every Friday, one Daily news staffer will give a behind the scenes 
look at one of this week’s stories. This week, LSA senior Ethan 
Levin wrote about faculty members’ research on replacing 
Confederate monuments.

“I tried to get a sense of the discussion by asking students around me 
what they expected, making sure that I had the chance to interview 
the panelists after the story was done. I was kind of surprised by the 
amount of disagreement there was on the panel of professors. Some of 
them thought that vandalism and defacing the statues was a good way 
of expressing disagreement with the Confederate statues. I thought 
the event was interesting because very often students get a sense of 
what other students think about social i ssues and what’s going on 
on campus, but you don’t get to hear as much about professors. To 
get different professors from different points of view and different 
backgrounds, applying their knowledge to contemporary issues and 
having open conversations with each other was kind of a new thing. I’m 
glad that I was able to see that firsthand.”

QUOTE OF THE WE E K 

“
When I’m in class or walking through campus, I 

kind of live in a bubble where I can almost forget about 
things. This bubble, it’s false, because at any point you 
can get deported. When you create a distance between 
your at-home community and this community, at least for 
me, you almost feel this false sense of safety.“

people doing outreach work to 
work together and collaborate 
and gain some efficiency, and 
to offer programs of its own — 
which we did initially as well.”

Additional focuses of the 

CEO include reaching out to 
individuals with an interest in 
increasing college accessibility 
and promoting success in their 
K-12 education.

“Our purpose has been to 

partner with schools, community 
organizations, 
parents, 

principals, counselors, teachers, 
anyone who has an interest in 
college access, to encourage 
excellence in schools,” he said. 
“That is, we wanted students to 
perform their best, to do well, to 
expect that going to a selective 
university like the University 
of Michigan was a reasonable 

aspiration for themselves, and to 
develop a college-ready within 
communities 
that 
perhaps 

originally did not have a culture 
of 
sending 
students 
on 
to 

college.”

Student Involvement
In order to connect CEO’s 

resources in K-12 schools across 
Michigan back to the students 
already at the University, CEO 
offers to consult services to 
various groups on campus when 
organizations want to reach out 
to K-12 students. Sheri Samaha is 
one of the program managers at 
the CEO, and she explained how 
the center worked with MUSIC 
Matters, a student organization 
that builds community through 
large-scale events on campus.

“Students 
like 
MUSIC 

Matters would come to us and ... 
they were interested in bringing 
a summer program together — 
and they actually did a summer 
camp called Move — and we were 

significant in helping them build 
that as far as consulting with 
the curriculum, transportation, 
etc.,” Samaha said.

LSA 
sophomore 
Matthew 

Szuromi, 
MUSIC 
Matters 

member, praised the center 
for helping the organization 
not only with large-scale tasks 
such as further establishing 
relationships 
with 
other 

organizations, but also with 
smaller details like the right 
mannerisms to use with younger 
kids. 

“They open a lot of doors 

for us,” Szuromi said in an 
email interview. “They have so 
much experience in the field of 
educational outreach. It is such a 
benefit to be able to learn about 
the strategies behind reaching 
out to children ... We have made 
great relationships with other 
departments and organizations 
facilitated 
by 
CEO. 
Just 

yesterday, we were invited to the 

University Outreach Council, 
where we got the chance to 
interact with a great group of 
professionals who specialize 
in outreach. In that meeting 
alone, we got a ton of interest 
and people offering to help out 
our cause.”

Another 
CEO 
supported 

project, Research Education 
and Activities for Classroom 
Teachers, was started by a 
group of graduate students in 
the College of Engineering and 
organizes a one-day workshop 
where University faculty and 
students present their research 
to K-12 teachers in order to 
educate teachers on how to 
facilitate 
discussions 
about 

higher education in their own 
classrooms.

In 
an 
email 
interview, 

Rackham 
student 
Rose 

Cersonsky 
explained 
she, 

along with Rackham student 
Leanna Foster, started REACT 
with the help of CEO as a way 
to expand outreach efforts to 
educators at the K-12 level and 
encourage more pre-college 

students to engage with the 
University. 
In 
April 
2017, 

Cersonsky and Foster brought 
the idea forward to CEO, and 
the first workshop was held in 
June.

“Leanna and I wanted to 

push our outreach efforts 
beyond their previous scope, 
as she and I noted the difficulty 
in getting graduate student 
volunteers to more than 5-10 
schools a semester and the 
general limitations of distance 
and availability,” Cersonsky 
wrote. “Together, she and I 
came up with the idea to equip 
and train teachers to conduct 
our 
outreach 
activities 
in 

their classrooms. With the 
support from CEO, it grew into 
a much larger idea of giving 
the teachers a touch point to 
the university, where they can 
spend a day immersed in the 
research conducted here.”

Following the workshop, 

two feedback opportunities 
were given, one immediately 
after the workshop and another 
six months later, Cersonsky 
explained. While suggestions 
from the first round offered 
ideas to include more “grade 
level-specific 
content,” 
the 

second round focused on the 
usability of workshop points 
in classrooms. Cersonsky said 
out of the 55 percent response 
rate, many teachers said while 
they did use their experiences 
from REACT more frequently 
than 
other 
methods 
that 

might inform their teaching, 
they hope to see more ways to 
involve students in University 
research. 
Without 
direct 

involvement 
in 
University 

efforts, students seeing the 
outcome of REACT training 
won’t 
see 
the 
University 

as an academic institution 
that’s within reach for lower-
socioeconomic status schools.

job pays in cash that matches a 
college degree? That’s the biggest 
discrepancy.”

U.S. Immigration and Customs 

Enforcement generally does not 
focus its activity in universities 
because 
they 
— 
along 
with 

hospitals and places of worship 
— 
are 
considered 
“sensitive 

locations.” Once students graduate, 
however, they are generally more 
susceptible to ICE detainment or 
deportation.

Workplaces are not afforded 

the same protected status. Over 
the summer, ICE inquired about 
the citizenship statuses of the 
employees 
of 
the 
restaurant 

owners at Café Zola and at Sava’s. 
In July, hundreds of Ann Arbor 
workers and residents gathered to 
condemn ICE’s increased activity.

Despite the fact that universities 

are mostly avoided by ICE, the 
agency’s activity can sometimes 
occur on the border between 
“sensitive locations” and the rest 
of the world. The Washtenaw 
Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant 
Rights works to confirm ICE 
activity and posts these alerts 
on their Facebook page. On Feb. 
5, WICIR posted about the Jan. 
31 ICE detainment of a Latino 
man outside his place of work 
the corner of Willard Street and 
Church Street — just across the 
street from East Quad Residence 
Hall.

ICE did not respond to request 

for comment.

In addition to worrying about 

ICE, undocumented immigrants 
in Washtenaw County have to face 
federal immigration enforcement 
by U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection because Ann Arbor 
is less than 100 miles from the 
Canadian border.

While jurisdictions like the 

University and the City of Ann 
Arbor have procedures in place 
prohibiting their law enforcement 

agencies 
from 
soliciting 

immigration status, according to 
Jim Baird, chief of the Ann Arbor 
Police Department, ICE often 
prefers not to involve local law 
enforcement 
in 
investigations 

anyway. AAPD and ICE stick 
to their own duties, Baird said, 
explaining how the inability of 
local law enforcement agencies to 
verify citizenship is a key reason 
why ICE does not want their 
interference.

“If we come in contact with 

somebody, I have absolutely no 
way to know if that person is here 
legally or illegally,” Baird said. 
“There’s no way for me to even 
figure that out. So we don’t do the 
investigation, we just don’t care. 
It’s not relevant information for us 
all whether somebody is a citizen 
or not.”

The 
only 
instance 
AAPD 

inquires 
about 
citizenship, 

Baird said, is when they arrest 
someone. This is because that 
person has the right to make their 
country’s embassy aware of their 
arrest. If the person is arrested 
for a felony or misdemeanor 
punishable by 93 or more days in 
jail, they are fingerprinted. ICE 
receives a notification from the 
fingerprinting database after a 
number of hours. ICE can then 
request a “detainer” of this person, 
asking the county jail to keep them 
two days after their jail sentence 
terminates. But, Baird said AAPD 
would not hold a person longer 
because of a detainer. 

Despite 
the 
amplified 

national presence of ICE and 
CBP, 
Baird 
emphasized 
local 

law enforcement’s unwavering 
commitment to protecting the 
safety of all Ann Arbor residents, 
including 
undocumented 

immigrants.

“From a local law enforcement 

perspective, there has been no 
change whatsoever,” Baird said. 
“In Ann Arbor, we have enacted 
an ordinance and a policy, but it 
really didn’t change anything, it 
just kind of codified what we were 

already doing and the way we’ve 
been doing it for decades. It really 
is a federal issue.”

The 
ambiguous 
future 
of 

immigration policy generates a lot 
of media attention surrounding 
the 
safety 
of 
undocumented 

immigrant 
populations. 

AAPD also works to confirm 
immigration enforcement activity 
by contacting ICE directly when 
they receive reports. The work 
of these organizations helps to 
verify rumors, which quickly 
circulate through undocumented 
immigrant 
populations 
when 

there is suspected ICE activity.

Baird explained how AAPD has 

asked ICE to notify the department 
when they are working in the local 
area. Yet, these notifications have 
lately become more infrequent, 
which Baird speculates could be 
for multiple reasons.

“I’ve actually seen a significant 

reduction in the times they’ve let 
us know,” Baird said. “I don’t know 
if that’s necessarily because a 
reduction of activity in Washtenaw 
County or if they’re just less strict 
about when they let us know.”

The 
Michigan 
Immigrant 

Rights Center, based in Ann Arbor, 
also serves the undocumented 
immigrant population providing 
legal counsel, education about 
immigrant rights and training for 
attorneys working on immigration 
cases pro bono.

Sarah Schoettle, Washtenaw 

staff attorney for MIRC, has 
observed the barriers that prevent 
undocumented immigrants from 
realizing their rights and helps 
her clients navigate the confusing 
nature 
of 
immigration 
law. 

Schoettle cites a host of reasons 
that discourage undocumented 
immigrants from pursuing legal 
pathways, 
including 
language 

barriers, unfamiliarity with the 
U.S. legal system and lack of 
knowledge regarding their rights. 

“In some ways, we need 

to bust a mystique that only 
a certain type of person can 
be involved at a higher level 
of engagement, and not just 
politics, but on community 
boards and things of that 
nature,” Campion said.

The panel emphasized the 

importance of civic involvement 
not only on a national scale, but 
also at a local level, such as in 
city council elections and even 
in public schools and libraries. 
Several panelists indicated a 
crucial step in increasing civic 
engagement in Ann Arbor was 
to increase accessibility to such 
involvement.

“I think we are in some 

ways purposefully complex in 
the way that we do business 
at even a very local level, 
and that again is a barrier to 

entry for a vast number of 
people,” Campion explained. 
“If you don’t understand how 
civic codes work, you can’t sit 
through a city council because 
you won’t know what they’re 
talking about 80 percent of the 
time. That’s intimidating to 
people.”

Another 
suggestion 
to 

increase 
accessibility 
was 

to improve the standard of 
living for Washtenaw County’s 
impoverished 
populations. 

Neel 
Hajra, 
president 
and 

CEO of the Ann Arbor Area 
Community Foundation, said 
ensuring basic needs such as 
food security and childcare 
would 
give 
underprivileged 

individuals more opportunities 
to pursue municipal interests.

“Twenty-five 
percent 
of 

households 
in 
Washtenaw 

County don’t make enough 
to meet their basic needs,” 
Hajra said. “When you live in 
a vibrant community with so 

much good going on, it’s pretty 
easy to miss all the challenge.”

Several 
attendees 
were 

actively involved in community 
organizations 
working 
to 

increase 
civic 
engagement. 

Jeffrey Smeargle, a member of 
the League of Women Voters 
of Ann Arbor, spoke of his 
efforts to energize Ann Arbor 
residents before the upcoming 
2018 midterm elections.

“We need for the next eight 

months to beat this like a 
drum,” he explained. “We have 
to get really obsessive about big 
turnout in the election.”

The forum was the third 

part of a four-event series 
being presented by the City 
of 
Ann 
Arbor. 
The 
series 

aims to facilitate discussion 
about sustainability and civic 
involvement. The first two 
forums focused on electric 
vehicle usage and ways of 
tracking 
environmental 

sustainability goals.

LEO is demanding the starting 

lecturer pay to be increased to 
$60,000 for Ann Arbor. The 
organization also wants a $1,000 
pay increase per year for lecturers 
and an increase in annual salary 
increases. On a non-salary side, 
LEO is also asking for increased 
diversity 
within 
faculty 
and 

financial support for lecturers that 
want to make their classes more 
inclusive and promote community 
service efforts with students.

Robinson 
also 
specifically 

addressed a recent counteroffer 
from the University regarding 
salary increase, which he said was 
insulting to LEO’s efforts.

“I’m not sure if (the counteroffer) 

even covers inflation,” Robinson 
said. “It’s a complete blow-off. 
They’re basically saying, ‘You must 
be joking. We aren’t even going to 
give you a serious counter.’… This is 
not their final offer obviously, but 
it’s such a low and insulting one. 
I certainly think they do not get 
that we are committed to making a 
paradigm shift this time.”

LEO will be bargaining in 

Dearborn on Friday, and in Ann 
Arbor on March 16. During the 

Ann Arbor bargaining session, the 
group plans to host a march around 
campus beginning at noon. A LEO 
staff member, who asked to be 
anonymous due to the nature of her 
job, also stated a strike will occur 
on April 9 and 10 if bargaining 
demands are not met.

Art & Design sophomores Miles 

Honey and Katie Lacroix came to 
the event after attending a poster-
making workshop held by Art & 
Design lecturer Andrea Cardinal. 
Honey said she felt the University 
does not treat its lecturers the way 
she believes they should.

“I’m not interested in being part 

of a University that doesn’t treat 
its (foundational) staff and faculty 
well,” Honey said.

Lacroix also said she wanted 

to support LEO after becoming 
close with her lecturers and seeing 
what they do to continue educating 
students despite low wages.

“When you start to get to know 

your 
teachers, 
and 
especially 

getting to know lecturers, you 
become friends with them during 
class and after class,” Lacroix said. 
“You get to know their personal 
stories and then when you start 
to learn that so many of your 
lecturers literally have three jobs … 
You realize they’re doing their best 
to teach you in class but they’re 
dealing with all of these stresses 
outside … I can’t not do anything.”

with silence,” Taylor said. 

This 
silence, 
she 
argued, 

leads to an acceptance of racist 
ideologies, contributing to the 
rise and acceptance of “alt-right” 
figures such as Richard Spencer.

In terms of implicit racism 

through economic policy, Taylor 
noted how on his campaign 
website, Trump promised to help 
working-class African Americans 
by using money from deporting 
illegal immigrants to help support 
inner-city communities. She said 
both Republicans and Democrats 

have been guilty of blaming and 
exploiting the most vulnerable 
population 
for 
social 
issues, 

specifically through the lens of the 
2016 presidential candidates.

“Racism is in the service for a 

larger agenda,” Taylor said. 

In an analysis of the 2016 

presidential 
election, 
Taylor 

explained the majority of Trump’s 
support came from wealthy white 
Americans, not the working class 
–– hence his strategic comments 
targeting the “alt-right.”

LSA junior Kevin Ashwood 

reflected on the similarity between 
the Democratic and Republican 
parties, especially with regard to 
their ideas about wealth and its 

distribution.

“A lot of the time we often 

identify Republicans with being 
the one percenters and Democrats 
with being definitely against it, 
when that’s really not the case,” 
Ashwood said.

Over 100 million eligible voters 

did not vote in the 2016 election, 
and Black voter turnout fell for 
the first time in over twenty years. 
Taylor attributes this to failures of 
both candidates to offer a serious 
attempt to fight inequality in the 
country.

Demand an end to gun violence

A generational look at feminism

Gun violence is happening 

right in front of us — to our 
friends 
and 
families 
across 

the nation — at a rate that is 
unmatched within the developed 
world. Now, it is in the hands of 
private citizens to change the 
culture of guns for our country. 
As we have seen time and time 
again, Congress alone cannot be 
trusted to change gun laws in 
any significant way. Should the 
national and political cultures 
surrounding guns shift, Congress 
will be more likely to enact gun 
reform laws that will hold the 
possibility of tangible change. 
These cultural shifts begins with 
us.

The 
struggle 
to 
change 

culture and policy has gained 
new life since the Parkland 
shooting. Currently, Parkland 
student activism has led to 
speeches, candlelight vigils and 
preparation drills about their 
experiences and the grieving 
process. Their conversation has 
drawn the attention of major 
national news sources like CNN, 
NBC’s “Meet the Press” and 
The New York Times. Using 
these platforms, the students 
are calling into question where 
our country’s priorities lie: Do 
we care more about protecting 
our guns or protecting the safety 
of our young people? Partially 
because of their efforts, major 
retailers have united to distance 
themselves from the NRA and 
institute higher age requirements 
for purchasing guns. For instance, 
Dick’s Sporting Goods, Walmart, 

Kroger Co. and L.L.Bean have 
all responded to the students’ 
activism by publicly stating they 
will no longer sell firearms or 
ammunition to people under the 
age of 21.

At this point, as the Stoneman 

Douglas students have already 
so powerfully shown, we need 
to rely on ourselves and our 
ability to take action, not just the 
government, to institute moral 
and tangible change. However, 
if gun culture is changed, we 
are hopeful that government at 
both the state and federal level 
will institute the much needed 
reform that a significant number 
of people, including many of the 
Parkland survivors, support.

Some 
might 
find 
it 

challenging, if not impossible, to 
reverse the culture of firearms 
that is so heavily embraced in 
this country. However, there 
is precedence for widespread 
cultural shifts in the United 
States; the demise of smoking’s 
popularity in the late 20th 
century shows that large-scale 
culture changes can occur.

We at The Daily also find 

the extreme influence of the 
NRA in the political sphere 
another extensive barrier to 
preventing 
school 
shootings 

and gun violence. According to 
The New York Times, senatorial 
heavyweights such as Marco 
Rubio, Rob Portman and Tom 
Cotton have received more than 
$3.3 million, $3 million and $1.9 
million dollars from the NRA 
since they began their political 

careers. Even without the NRA’s 
monetary 
influence, 
which 

extends to many more elected 
officials, the group’s impact is 
still highly potent due to their 
ability to mobilize their members 
to vote for the candidates they 
endorse. If you are as concerned 
about the influence the NRA has 
in our electoral politics as we are, 
we encourage you to vote and to 
make sure your peers do as well. 
The surest way to change gun 
policy is to remove the elected 
officials from office who are so 
intertwined with the NRA.

The 
importance 
of 

changing 
gun 
laws 
cannot 

be overstated. Gun violence 
has become normalized and 
even desensitized because of 
its prevalence, especially in a 
generation that has grown up 
seeing the frequency of these 
shootings. This frequency and 
subsequent media cycles and 
political debate has become 
all too familiar. But for us as 
college students, inaction could 
be a matter of life or death. We 
have an obligation to ourselves, 
our 
communities 
and 
our 

nation to change gun culture 
as well as to replace the elected 
officials enabling the NRA to 
dictate public policy and hold 
America hostage to its views. 
We, at The Daily, encourage 
our readers to take part in 
the ongoing student activism 
by contacting their elected 
officials to demand reform and 
to vote in the 2018 midterms 
and beyond.

HANNAH HARSHE | COLUMN

“

We are going to be the kids 
you read about in textbooks!”

This is the proclamation 

of Emma Gonzalez, a senior 
at Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High School and a survivor of the 
Parkland, Fla. massacre. Within 
four days of the tragic death of 
her classmates, Gonzalez, along 
with several classmates, organized 
a campaign called Never Again 
MSD and a nationwide protest 
called March For Our Lives. Their 
petition, which calls for stricter 
background checks for gun buyers, 
has almost 150,000 signatures.

If 
America 
has 
learned 

anything in 2018, it is to never 
underestimate 
the 
power 
of 

Generation Z.

I kept this in mind when 

choosing whom I wanted to feature 
in my column on International 
Women’s Day. The holiday was 
adopted by the United Nations 
in 1975, and it only takes a quick 
Google search to learn about it 
from a public figure like Emma 
Watson or Hillary Clinton. But, as 
is the case with too many pertinent 
issues, we don’t often hear from 
young people on this topic. In the 
spirit of reversing this habit, I had 
the privilege of speaking with two 
intelligent and powerful young 
women.

Brianna Harshe is a 12-year-

old student-athlete. She plays club 
soccer, and spends most of her time 
either training or doing homework. 
She also happens to be my sister. I 
was able to interview her via phone 
on her way to soccer training on 
Monday.

Harshe was unfamiliar with 

International Women’s Day before 
I mentioned it, but, based on the 
name, she surmises, “It’s a day for 
women and what they do for the 
world because they didn’t get as 
much respect in the past.”

She is quick to note the 

discrepancies 
when 
it 
comes 

to gender representation in the 

educational system: “We learn 
about women mostly because 
they’re women and not really 
because of what they did. We 
learn about men because of what 
they did.” According to a study 
by PLOS One, three out of four 
scientists depicted in primary 
school textbooks are men. A 
UNESCO report released on 
International Women’s Day in 2016 
notes that gender bias is persistent 
in 
textbooks 
worldwide, 
and 

this sabotages “girls’ motivation, 
participation and achievement in 
school.”

Harshe says that her role 

model is Carli Lloyd, because, “She 
was one of the first female soccer 
players to get respect.” Lloyd was 
an American soccer player, a two-
time Olympic gold medalist, a FIFA 
Women’s World Cup champion and 
the FIFA Women’s Player of the 
Year in 2015 and 2016. She is also a 
fantastic public figure to admire on 
International Women’s Day.

In 2016, Lloyd, along with four 

teammates on the US Women’s 
National Team, filed a wage 
discrimination complaint against 
U.S. Soccer Federation. In her 
op-ed for the New York Times, she 
explained, “If I were a male soccer 
player who won a World Cup for 
the United States, my bonus would 
be $390,000. Because I am a female 
soccer player, the bonus I got for 
our World Cup victory last summer 
was $75,000.” Lloyd may be one of 
the first female soccer players to 
earn the respect that she has, and 
yet she knows she has a long way to 
go in order to gain the respect that 
male soccer players have. Someday 
Harshe may be a professional 
soccer player and thanks to role 
models like Lloyd, Harshe will 
know that she is worthy of the same 
salary as her male counterparts.

The other student I spoke with 

is Riley Shaughnessy, who is 13 
years old. In addition to running 
cross-country 
for 
her 
middle 

school, Shaughnessy is a member of 
the National Junior Honor Society. 
I am a friend of her older sister, so 
I had the privilege of interviewing 
her over the phone after she got out 
of school on Monday.

Shaughnessy 
has 
also 

noted the problem of gender 
representation in school, and has 
taken initiative to change it: “I try 
to learn about (men and women) 
equally, but other people don’t. 
Other kids sometimes make guys 
higher. I think there are a lot more 
guys in history, but I don’t think 
that’s very fair.”

In 
just 
10 
short 
years, 

Shaughnessy 
and 
her 
peers 

will be entering the workforce. 
Shaughnessy envisions that by the 
time she enters the workforce, the 
world will be much more gender 
equitable. “I don’t think there will 
be as many stay-at-home moms,” 
she says. “And there will be more 
stay-at-home dads.”

This is a complex, and likely 

accurate, assertion. Stay-at-home 
motherhood, in and of itself, is 
in no way shameful, however, 
mothers are often driven to stay 
at home not because of their 
personal choice, but because of 
cultural norms and office policies 
that deem men more worthy of the 
workplace. Similarly, fathers often 
feel as though staying at home 
instead of pursuing a career is a 
sign of weakness. A truly gender 
equitable world would allow 
mothers and fathers to determine 
whether they want to stay at home 
based on personal circumstance, 
not based simply on gender.

n the University of Michigan’s 
Angell 
Hall 
Auditorium 

A, 
the 
mirthless 
drone 

of a college student not much 
older than myself is discussing 
bystander intervention. Or at least, 
he’s describing it. He imbues the 
lecture with so little care that the 
other young men surrounding him 
are just as disengaged, as though 
he were talking about the most 
inconsequential of problems.

For a council that has been 

under scrutiny in recent months, 
the Interfraternity Council has 
visibly done little that actually 
exhibits their commitment to 
ending sexual assault within Greek 
life.

Kinesiology senior Cass Bouse-

Eaton is ready to see this change. 
Bouse-Eaton is one of the leaders 
of the Panhellenic Peer Educator 
program, originally created by 
U-M alumni Alyssa Gorenberg 
and Eileen Enright to educate 
and prevent sexual misconduct 
within the Greek community. 
Now, with over 100 members 
across all 17 sororities within the 
Panhellenic Association, they are 
deeply impacting with programs 
such as the Panhel Speak Out, 
where survivors from all councils 
were invited to speak about their 
experiences within the community.

Bouse-Eaton, 
who 
helped 

organize the Speak Out alongside 
creator Ally Cohen, an LSA senior, 
is already beginning to see the 
indelible mark PPE is making. She 
spoke with me about her goals with 
the Speak Out, describing how she 
attended the annual Sexual Assault 
and Prevention and Awareness 
Center Speak Out in spring 2015 
and was incredibly moved. Being 
a recent survivor at that time, she 
said that Speak Out made her feel 
empowered, heard and cared for in 
a way she hadn’t felt within a large 
group setting on campus.

Furthermore, 
she 
believed 

the experience of survivors in 
the Greek life community could 
differ from the general population, 
and wanted to create a space 
for both survivors to share their 
experiences and allies to give their 
support.

This is something she would 

like to see expand to other councils 
and recognizes the strides IFC has 
made in recent months. However, 
she has called on them to get these 
programs off the ground, saying, 
“IFC is making great strides on 
beginning a program that will 
work for their council, but needs 
more manpower and volunteers to 

get off the ground.”

However, even if IFC has tried 

to repair itself, these attempts 
have not manifested after the self-
imposed ban.

Since the suspension imposed 

on social programming by IFC 
there have been regulations placed 
on what alcohol can be provided by 
fraternities at mixers and parties. 
Though they have made several 
attempts at rectifying the excessive 
hospitalizations that occurred last 
year little has been done to change 
the culture of sexual assault and 
misogyny that has been fostered.

Between 
2015 
and 
2016, 

there were 88 sexual misconduct 
allegations 
reported 
against 

fraternities 
on 
campus. 
The 

suspension was, as explained by 
Alex Mayhan, former executive 
vice president of IFC, meant 
to launch a period where the 
members of the board would 
begin “assessing our policies and 
practices and developing a formal 
plan going forward.”

Yet 
on 
issues 
of 
sexual 

misconduct and violence, the 
members of IFC have shown little 
effort in reforming the bare-bone 
system erected to stagnate this 
kind of behavior. They should be 
making more bold strides towards 
making fraternities safer, just as 
Panhel has done to raise awareness 
of sexual assault. 

Prior 
to 
the 
suspension, 

associate members of fraternities 
attended 
mandatory 
IFC-led 

programming and Change It Up!, a 
session offered by the University’s 
Office of Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion Training and Education 
to bring, as their website describes, 
“bystander 
intervention 
skills 

to the University of Michigan 
community for the purpose of 
building inclusive, respectful and 
safe communities.”

Yet some students see these 

kinds of programs as insufficient. 
I spoke with LSA freshman Noah 
Kalishman, who is currently an 
associate member of my fraternity. 
We both attended the functions, 
and neither of us was impressed 
with 
the 
execution 
of 
such 

programming.

Kalishman 
described 
how 

the IFC program and Change It 
Up! demonstrated a clear lack of 
interest on both the University 
and IFC’s behalf in halting the 
sanction of rape culture within 
Greek life. He stated plainly that, 
“these programs are terrible … No 
one wants to get lectured at for an 
hour … They are simply things that 

the University does to say that they 
taught us, when in reality they are 
terrible and ineffective”.

And, though Bouse-Eaton was 

not as critical of these events, to 
some extent she agrees, saying, 
“Providing the information is so 
important, but just as vital is the 
integration of this information into 
the culture of each sisterhood and 
brotherhood, which only happens 
through continued conversation.”

Such attitudes have even forced 

certain fraternities to take sexual 
assault prevention education into 
their own hands. In the fraternity 
Kalishman is currently joining, 
he 
described 
how 
attending 

the Panhellenic Speak Out was 
mandated by the chapter itself so 
that new members could gauge 
the effects of sexual misconduct, 
especially within Greek life.

Kalishman was laudatory of the 

Speak Out, which he felt was both 
deeply moving and galvanizing, 
saying, “(The Speak Out) made 
me think about things that I have 
seen in my time at Michigan … 
It illustrated that anyone in the 
community could become a victim 
of sexual assault.” He felt that in 
the future, programming should 
“emulate that of the Speak Out.”

He was hesitant on making 

the programming a mandatory, 
implying that it may cause people 
to dread attending. However, that 
does not mean there are ways for 
IFC to test out more personalized 
approaches. 
As 
Bouse-Eaton 

described, there are pilot programs 
the Office of Greek Life and SAPAC 
are launching to encourage more 
open discourse on sexual assault 
within Greek life.

But, as Bouse-Eaton explained, 

IFC cannot rely on Panhel to do 
the work for them. It’s time for 
IFC to step up in clamping down 
on assault within Greek life. To 
do so, perhaps it’s time IFC made 
a visible step towards emulating 
programs such as PPE and the 
Speak Out.

And in the meantime, Bouse-

Eaton says, “Keep talking with 
your brothers, with your friends 
in 
sororities, 
and 
do 
some 

examination of both yourself and 
your chapters. That’s how true 
culture change starts.”

Note: 
Cass 
Bouse-Eaton’s 

personal views don’t necessarily 
reflect those of the Office of Greek 
Life or the National Panhellenic 
Conference.

Panhel supports what IFC hasn’t

T

he Parkland, Fla. massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School 
and the more recent shooting at Central Michigan University have 
renewed the cycle of heated political debate and media discussion 

surrounding gun control in the United States. For members of the National 
Rifle Association and others, the salience of the issue of safety in and around 
school grounds provides an avenue to push for an increase in armed security. 
However, we at The Michigan Daily believe that the wave of gun violence that 
plagues our nation directly results from the alarming leniency of gun laws 
within the United States and the culture that surrounds the NRA and the 
political power the lobbying group wields. Despite the devastating trends of 
gun violence, we are optimistic that light can be brought to the issue and that 
meaningful reform is possible.

Rhye’s show at El Club an organic expression of art

For Rhye, it has always 
been about the music. Initially 
starting as a joint project of 
singer/songwriter Mike Milosh 
and producer Robin Hannibal, 
the band fell completely under 
the command of Milosh due to 
the quiet exit of Hannibal after 
their debut album Woman. 
The years that followed were 
tumultuous; Rhye’s relationship 
with 
record 
label 
Polydor 
crumbled and, as a result, 
Milosh bought out his band, 
touring Woman relentlessly in 
order to ensure Rhye still had 
a future. His dedication and 
perseverance in continuing his 
craft is visible in every careful, 
measured note of Rhye’s most 
recent release, Blood.
It was also visible in El 
Club on Mar. 6, as Rhye took 
to the stage for the Detroit 
stop of their tour. Under the 
dim stage lights, the focused 
concentration 
on 
Milosh’s 
face as he played songs from 
both Blood and Woman was 
barely 
discernible, 
yet 
the 
message was clear: This was 
an artist who was completely 
surrendering to the art he had 
produced. Sincerity sweetened 
every 
melody; 
intensity 
strengthened every chorus.
Rhye is a band meant to 
be seen live. Their normally 
muted, stripped-down tracks 
were injected with new energy. 
The opening song — “3 days,” 
off Woman — set the mood for 
the rest of the night: Hazy blue 
spotlights added a dreamy tint 
to every rise and fall of the 

keyboard, every pulse of the 
drum, every trembling detail 
within Milosh’s vocals. He 
crooned, “We got three days to 
feel each other / We got three 
days to sing this song,” and the 
tempo swelled, developing a life 
of its own. 
The rest of the show was 

equally as dynamic. The funky 
rhythms of more upbeat songs 
“Phoenix,” “Count To Five” 
and “Hunger” were drawn 
out, 
backing 
instrumentals 
often veering off into elaborate 
solos that do not appear on the 
albums themselves and turned 
the audience into a pit of waving 
limbs. The slower tempos of 
quieter songs “Waste,” “Song 
For You” and “Please” were also 
extended — the delicate pull of 
the accompanying live cello 
and violin drawing attention to 
the hushed release of Milosh’s 

voice.
For someone who prefers to 
largely remain in the shadows 
of anonymity, Milosh had a 
surprisingly personable stage 
presence. Weaving around on 
stage, he danced to the beat of 
his own songs, moving in sync 
with the crowd and, like the 
rest of us, seemingly entranced 
with 
the 
music’s 
hypnotic 
sway. In between songs, he 
cracked jokes, politely told 
some audience members off 
for being a little too loud in 
the back and complimented 
the vibe of the venue. The last 
place Rhye played had been too 
big; El Club, he remarked, was 
just small enough, fostering a 
distinct intimacy. As always, 
his voice was smooth, measured 
— melodious even in speech.
It reverberated around the 
expanse of the venue — soft, 
yet still compelling — as Milosh 
asked for the stage lights to be 
dimmed to the point of near 
non-existence before launching 
into the aching expanse of 
“Open” during the last half of 
the show. Unable to be seen, the 
band grew larger-than-life and 
painfully personal, each note 
delivered with a distinct caress. 
“I’m a fool for that shake in 
your thighs / I’m a fool for that 
sound in your sighs,” Milosh 
murmured 
into 
the 
dark, 
and the string arrangement 
responded. 
Somewhere 
out 
of the gloom, various brass 
instruments mournfully began 
their 
serenade. 
The 
song 
shuddered on, and as you stood, 
gutted and vulnerable in the 
shadows, you almost felt like 
Rhye was speaking directly to 
you.

TV REVIEW

For most of the country, the 
city of Flint is associated with one 
thing: a water crisis. Whenever 
the Mich. city is mentioned, it 
is often accompanied by shots 
of brown water bubbling out 
of fountains, parents begging 
for proper help and politicians 
exploiting a city in turmoil. Yet 
trouble in Flint was brewing 
before the water crisis ever hit; 
that was just another unfortunate 
problem piled on top of a city 
already crushed under the weight 
of crime and poverty. In “Flint 
Town,” an eight-part docuseries 
premiering on Netflix, viewers 
are offered behind-the-scenes 
footage of the broken city of 
Flint, and the police department 
doing everything in its power 
to hold the city, and its citizens, 
together.
“Flint Town” has no time for a 
soft opening. The series opens up 
on a black screen, with an audio of 
a police radio giving details about 
a shooting that has just occurred. 
As the audio continues, the black 
screen fades into an aerial shot of 
an abandoned street, dusted with 
snow — the only sign of life being 
a single cop car driving through 
the darkness. Soon after, a 

motionless hand is shown resting 
in the snow, lit up by blue and red, 
as a woman is heard desperately 
pleading and sobbing: “Save my 
son, please. You have to save my 
son.”
These 
disturbing 
scenes 
and high emotions permeate 

consistently throughout “Flint 
Town.” The once vibrant city is 
crumbling, and the documentary 
does not sugarcoat that. At 
first glance, it may seem like a 
hyperbolized “cop show,” used 
as a vehicle to push a pro-police 
agenda in a time when the 
relationship between police and 
the people, especially African-
Americans, is so strained. But 
truly it is much more than 
that. The emotions are raw, the 
frustrations are relevant and the 
danger that every single person 
in the town faces is very, very 
real.
And while the stories are 
being told from the eyes of law 
enforcement, the show does not 
feel politicized. Rather, there is 
an apolitical aura of desperation 
from the police department 
low on resources and from 

citizens who feel abandoned and 
betrayed. Every episode of the 
series builds upon the last, from 
veteran police officers to new 
recruits, many coming straight 
from the streets of Flint ready to 
reclaim their city. 
Watching 
the 
rundown 
houses, 
the 
nights 
full 
of 
shootings and the fear etched 
into every Flint citizen’s face, it 
is hard to believe that the city 
is just short of an hour drive 
from Ann Arbor, where 18-year-
olds are more concerned about 
studying for finals or figuring 
out their plans on a Saturday 
night than getting shot or finding 
clean water. In this bubble of 
privilege, Flint’s struggle seems 
far removed, like a foreign 
country engulfed in civil war. But 
this city is our neighbor, and it 
too was once lively and affluent. 
Flint’s story may be fading from 
the news cycle, but that does not 
mean that its problems are going 
away. Indifference is as toxic to 
the city as its water supply, and 
the stories of “Flint Town” should 
not only shock you, but implore 
you to seek change. Highlighting 
the cycle of distrust and defeat 
between the town’s citizens, 
police and administration, “Flint 
Town” reaches beyond the city’s 
lines as both a call to action and a 
cry for help.

Don’t just do art, teach it

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

For all the self-proclaimed 
artists out there, heads up: 
Teaching art is a lot harder 
than creating art yourself. I’ve 
done visual art all my life, but 
nothing could have prepared 
me for the morning when I first 
walked into Mission: City.
Mission: City is the name 
of the community center in 
Brightmoor, a small town on 
the northwest side of Detroit. 
Since 
many 
Detroit 
public 
schools cut art from their 
curriculum, students from the 
University, myself included, 
lead children from various 
Detroit public schools in art 
and 
music 
activities 
after 
school hours. Visual art has 
always been my escape from 
reality; I’m happiest when 
paints and a blank canvas are 
sitting in front of me. Teaching 
art to others, especially those 
who aren’t fortunate enough 
to experience art on a regular 
basis, 
seemed 
immensely 
fulfilling.
Before 
my 
first 
trip, 
I 
subconsciously 
dreamed 
up 
a fantasy where the children 
were sitting square in their 
seats, huge smiles on their 
faces 
and 
focusing 
deeply 
on the art in front of them. I 
imagined a sweet little girl 
raising her hand in the air for 
help and a University student 
rushing over to help her. I 
maintained this fantasy when 
we reached Mission: City and 
as I set up the materials for the 
day’s stained glass art project. 
Then the children arrived, the 
floodgates opened and all hell 
broke loose.
Not long ago, my grandma 
told me about the locusts: a 
type of grasshopper-like insect, 
widely 
prevalent 
in 
Africa 
and Asia, that only appears in 
swarms of millions. People who 
have seen them say that the sky 
becomes brown and all sunlight 
is shut out while the locusts 
fly above. They come, wreak 
havoc and are gone. When the 
children walked into Mission: 
City, I knew they were going 
to be like a swarm of locusts. 
I looked at the excited smiles 
on their faces, watched their 

feet bounce up and down with 
impatience and my fantasy of 
a peaceful Saturday morning 
filled with art vanished as 
quickly as it had appeared.
When the children, about 
25 of them, were crammed 
together in the small room, I 
started to explain the lesson 
plan for the morning. It didn’t 
work. One boy had started to 
repeatedly fall out of his chair 

to draw attention to himself, 
but he was dangerously close 
to the wall and University 
students 
were 
frantically 
trying to break his falls. The 
endearing girl in front of me 
had given in to temptation and 
was eating the neon purple oil 
pastel that had been sitting 
on the table. She looked up at 
me and flashed a smile, her 
lips completely purple but her 
smile never-ending. Helplessly, 
I just stared.
Ten 
minutes 
of 
damage 
control 
later, 
the 
other 
University 
students 
and 
I 
had succeeded in explaining 
the stained glass project. I 
jumped around from student 
to student, trying to help them 
brainstorm things to paint. 
I 
had 
overestimated 
their 
abilities — most of the children 
were perfectly content drawing 
one big heart on their paper 

and calling it a day. If I was 
lucky, 
they 
drew 
multiple 
small hearts instead of one 
for variety. Where was the 
rewarding teaching experience 
I had come for? I managed to 
urge some children to draw 
landscapes, 
but 
halfway 
through the lesson, I looked 
around the room and dozens 
of shakily drawn hearts stared 
back at me.
Somewhere 
along 
the 
line, my role had become 
less of teaching and more 
of disaster prevention. The 
swarm of locusts was reigning 
in Mission: City, and I had 
to 
prioritize 
safety 
before 
teaching. For the entire two 
hour period, I hustled through 
the crowded room cleaning up 
messes, distributing paint and 
walking endless children to 
the bathroom. But honestly, it 
wasn’t the worst thing in the 
world. At the end of the session, 
all of the children had produced 
some form of art. I wasn’t able 
to teach them anything new, but 
they probably wouldn’t have 
listened anyway. Disregarding 
the rules, they had created 
what made them happy. An 
older girl of about 10 came up 
to me at the end of the session 
and showed me her painting: 
A large heart in which she had 
written the names of all the 
people she loved. It filled me 
with joy to see the girl draw 
something she cared about 
and be proud enough of her 
creation to share it with me.
Most 
of 
the 
subsequent 
trips were filled with this 
same kind of chaos, but they 
were also filled with similar 
moments of happiness. Maybe 
this defiance of the rules made 
the children more satisfied 
with their artwork, or maybe 
they 
just 
didn’t 
feel 
like 
listening. Regardless, I found 
peace in the mayhem. Art 
can be an incredibly personal 
experience, and teaching isn’t 
always the best way to produce 
a love for the arts in others. 
In the calm after the storm, I 
knew I hadn’t taught much to 
the children, but I’d learned to 
let go and allow the children 
to find their own path in their 
artwork. Rules were rendered 
obsolete if they were creating 
something they truly loved.

When 
a 
group 
of 
gay, 
male upperclassmen in the 
University’s musical theatre 
department saw a need for a 
space to celebrate an identity 
that they hold so close to 
themselves, they created the 
“Boys, Boys, Boys!” Cabaret — 
a biennial performance put on 
by the group.
As performers and students 
studying musical theatre, this 
group realized that there 
was no better way to open 
a dialogue about the issues 
surrounding 
representation 
of the gay male community 
in 
musical 
theatre 
than 
through performance. The 
lack of representation for 
this community is not a new 
conversation within the world 
of theatre, and this age-old 
trend sparked a desire in the 
young men of the University’s 
department to work to make a 
change.
Justin 
Showell, 
Griffin 
Binnicker and Matthew Kemp 
— all juniors in the musical 
theatre department in the 
School of Music, Theatre and 
Dance — wrote in an email 
interview with The Michigan 
Daily, the collaborative nature 
of their answers a testament to 
how well they work together 
on projects like “Boys, Boys, 
Boys!” They spoke a lot on 
the catalyst for beginning the 
cabaret, and what it means to 
them.
“This cabaret’s conception 
was 
initially 
inspired 
by the lack of gay male 
representation in the musical 
theatre world; particularly in 
the ‘leading male’ trope. Too 
often is the assertion made 
that 
a 
homosexual 
man’s 
neutral is not believable as 
a romantic male lead. We 
constantly find that society’s 
heteronormativity 
not 
only 
stunts 
potential 
in 
our 
everyday lives but also in our 
artistic 
development,” 
they 
said when asked about what 
ultimately inspired the event.
The struggle of being a 
homosexual man in a world 
filled 
with 
heterosexual 
characters is often met with 
comments like, “Oh, he can 
play 
straight 
really 
well,” 
which could be countered by, 
“He can’t play straight at all.” 
These types of assumptions, 
in addition to others, are what 
makes being a gay male in the 
field inherently difficult.
The trio also spoke on 
cinematic representations of 
the gay narrative and how 

that ties into their inspiration 
behind holding the cabaret.
“Recently, 
leading 
roles 
have been portrayed by openly 
straight 
men 
(“Moonlight,” 
“Call Me By Your Name,” 
etc.). In this climate, it can be 
difficult to cultivate a sense 
of belonging in the theatrical 
field.”
Despite these challenges, 
the group is more than excited 

to have the opportunity to 
celebrate themselves in a way 
they love so much this coming 
weekend at the Kerrytown 
Concert House.
“The ‘Boys, Boys, Boys!’ 
Cabaret is a chance to stand 
in solidarity and shape our 

own 
sense 
of 
belonging,” 
they said. “This will be an 
evening of songs, traditionally 
sung by female characters in 
acclaimed musicals, to express 

the universality of love and 
to give us a conduit for our 
unique narratives.”
The 
performance 
will 
showcase 
seven 
of 
the 
department’s 
upperclassmen 
males, all with the mutual 
desire to tell their stories 
and make a space for more 
dialogues to arise about the 
day-to-day 
challenges 
they 
face carrying these identities 
in their field.
As 
performers, 
Showell, 
Binnicker and Kemp hope 
that the audience members 
who come to support them 
this weekend are able to take 
away many things from their 
performance. 
In 
general, 
marginalized people deserve 
platforms 
to 
share 
their 
narratives just as much as 
their normative counterparts 
do. In creating this cabaret, 
they not only create a space 
for themselves, but also inspire 
other minority groups to do so 
as well.
When thinking about the 
way in which theatre effects an 
audience’s sense of empathy, 
the group also had a lot to 
say about the relatability of 
their narratives to the general 
audience and demographic of 
people they are performing to.
“In 
representing 
marginalized 
identities, 
it 
becomes evident that people 
who you felt were worlds 
different than you actually 
share many similarities. When 
people of privilege are able to 
see glimpses of themselves in 
the narrative of persecuted 
people, we may find that 
society takes leaps forward 
in inclusion and tolerance of 
many, different cultures,” they 
said. This really plays into 
the importance of doing this 
kind of theatre, which seeks 
to start a dialogue and make a 
statement for a live audience.
The group looks forward to 
performing for audiences this 
weekend, 
celebrating 
their 
own identities and having a 
space to do what they love 
with 
full 
creative 
agency. 
When 
asked 
how 
musical 
theatre is the best or most 
prime medium to use for this 
type of statement, they had 
plenty to say.
“The musical theatre holds 
a mirror up to the society that 
the piece is speaking to,” they 
said. “People are far more 
likely to absorb and understand 
another side of the coin when 
it is presented to them in a 
way that is entertaining. The 
theatre is unexpected, and we 
get the most gratitude when 
people don’t even realize their 
minds are being changed.”

BOOKS THAT BUILT US

I don’t really remember 
much after stepping on the 
tarmac 
in 
that 
cold 
Jan. 
winter. I remember finding it 
odd that you have to take a bus 
back to the airport terminal in 
Germany instead of strolling 
down 
the 
jet 
bridge, 
but 
that’s about it. There were no 
impressive details of settling 
into a new home, going to a 
new school and meeting new 
people in a completely new 
country.
What I do remember — 
stupidly, vividly — was the 
moment my parents dropped 
the 
earth-shattering 
news 
right on top of me. To set the 
scene, I was in the fourth 
grade, living in the quaint 
little upstate South Carolina 
town of Anderson. I was by all 

means a normal boy (LEGOs, 
books, screwing around with 
friends outside, etc.), yet in 
that normality lay a blissful 
sense of childlike ignorance. 
For the first nine years of my 
life I marched to the tune of 
my family’s drum, living life 
without questioning.
But completely uprooting 
and relocating to a whole 
new continent when you have 
hardly been outside of state 
borders for your entire life 
will make anyone question, 
even a kid. So, when I was told 
my family would be moving 
to Germany, I naturally had 
questions. Only I had no idea 
how to answer them, so I opted 
to flip on Cartoon Network, 
holding back tears as I refused 
to 
acknowledge 
my 
new 
reality.
Settling into this new home 
wasn’t hard (being a “new kid” 
gives you a certain mysterious, 

alien-like aura that allures 
fourth graders). The hard part 
was making it feel like home. 
No number of friends I made 
and adventures I went on 
could shake the feeling that 
I was living in a European 
spinoff of my life in South 
Carolina. 
However, 
there 
was one book hidden right 
under my nose which could’ve 
made me realize the spinoff 
is sometimes as good as the 
original: 
Saint-Exupéry’s 
magnificent 
novella 
“The 
Little Prince.”
On 
the 
surface, 
“The 
Little Prince” is a beautifully 
illustrated 
and 
imaginative 
children’s 
story. 
The 
protagonist 
is 
a 
downed 
aviator stranded in the Sahara 
who chances upon the Prince 
wandering the desert. As he 
fixes his plane, he gets lost in 
the tales of the Prince, his home 
planet and his interstellar

journey. The essence of the 
novella, though, is much more 
poignant than any child should 
be able to understand. It is the 
sincerely short tale of a lost 
soul; a child who quests to 
find understanding in a world 
of confusing, boring and vain 
grown-ups.
“The Little Prince” does 
not get caught up in wistful 
adult 
tragedy 
but 
instead 
seeks childhood certainties 

and 
inner 
peace. 
Saint-
Exupéry dedicates the book 
to a longtime grown-up friend 
of his while looking to his 
child readers for forgiveness 
because “All grown-ups were 
once children,” adding, “but 
only few of them remember 
it.” The book is targeted more 
at the parent reading than the 
child sitting on their lap — 
on one page, it’s a critique on 
materialism 
before 
turning 
to a meditation on the nature 
of human relationships, all 
expressed via delicately simple 
prose. Each word is carefully 
chosen — its most memorable 
aphorism, “One sees clearly 
only with the heart. What is 
essential is invisible to the 
eye,” was rewritten about 15 
times before Saint-Exupéry 
was finally able to settle on the 

most to-the-point yet eloquent 
way of writing what he needed 
to write.
“The Little Prince” eluded 
me growing up. My mom 
read it to me here and there 
when I was young, and soon 
after moving to Germany we 
read it as a class at my new 
international 
school. 
Even 
then I had no real memories 
of it, other than a fleeting 
mental image of the famous 
drawing of a boa constrictor 
swallowing 
an 
elephant. 
It 
wasn’t 
until 
recently 
rediscovering the novella did 
it have a profound impact 
on me. Now almost a decade 
older and far removed from 
the days when my mom and I 
would take a day trip to comb 
through children’s literature 
at a Books-A-Million, I went 
and got a copy of “The Little 
Prince,” partly due to the off-
hand recommendation of a 
friend who cherished it. After 
finally reading it by myself for 
the first time, I felt like a child 
again, in no small part due 
to the happy tears streaming 
down my face.
Even when I moved back 
to the United States, I never 
felt like I had a proper home. 
“Home” is a word I associate 
with a childlike nostalgia for 
a predictable comfort and 
warmth that I unfortunately 
have never been quite able to 
replicate post-moving. For me, 
home is not where my family 
is or where my friends are, 
it’s where my heart lies; it’s a 
feeling of belonging. Houses 
are 
only 
interchangeable 
background sets for me at this 
point. Often, I’ll find myself 
wandering around my current 
abode half-jokingly dreading 
the day when I’ll have to yet 
again help my parents pack 
up the sheer amount of stuff 
that has nestled itself in the 
corners.
The titular prince’s home 
is a small asteroid, small 
enough so one “would watch 
the twilight whenever (they) 
wanted to” simply by scooting 
their chair. It is populated by 
three volcanoes — two active 
and one extinct — and a rose 

he comes to love. In embarking 
on an astronomical journey to 
seek what the universe has to 
offer, he has to leave his home 
behind to discover what home 
truly means to him. In a piece 
of ageless wisdom, the Prince 
comforts the aviator when 
it comes time for the two to 
depart:
“You’ll 
have 
stars 
like 
nobody else … When you look 
up at the sky at night, since I’ll 
be living on one of them, since 
I’ll be laughing on one of them, 
for you it’ll be as if all the stars 
are laughing. You’ll have stars 
that can laugh!”
If only I knew the stars 
were laughing with me when I 
stared out of my skylight at the 
glimpse of the dark German 
landscape. Those same stars 

were laughing with my friends 
back in South Carolina, the 
people that I thought I had 
already said goodbye to for the 
last time. Reading “The Little 
Prince” again taught me that 
even though we may physically 
lose people and things as we 
travel down our journey of life, 
they remain part of us forever. 
Our past experiences link us 
to what we have left behind, 
enabling us to build a place 
that feels like home whenever 
and wherever we feel is right. 
While the little Prince of the 
book ultimately returns to his 
original home, for me it will 
not be the same. All I know is 
whenever I find my true home, 
there will always be a spot 
on my bookshelf for Saint-
Exupéry’s little masterpiece.

Doubt Zavier Simpson? Prepare to be proven wrong

When he first came to campus, 

Isaiah Livers didn’t know much 
about Zavier Simpson.

So during one of the Wolverines’ 

summer workouts, the freshman 
forward 
decided 
he’d 
post 

Simpson up. It seemed like obvious 
mismatch. Livers, listed at six-foot-
seven, 230 pounds, is one of the 
most physically imposing players 
on the Michigan men’s basketball 
team. Simpson, meanwhile, is 
sturdy but stands at a layman’s six-
foot-nothing.

Livers 
bent 
his 
knees 
for 

leverage, faked one way and 
attempted to beat Simpson going 
the other. He got nowhere. At that 
moment, Livers learned everything 
he needed to know about Simpson.

“I tried to post up on him — no 

way,” Livers recalled last weekend. 
“He’s so low to the ground.

“He’s a pitbull.”
And if Simpson’s a pitbull, the 

defense is his marked territory.

Teammates 
are 
quick 
to 

acknowledged that the diminutive 
point guard keys the Wolverines’ 
ninth-ranked 
scoring 
defense. 

Livers 
calls 
him 
Michigan’s 

energy guy. Junior forward Mortiz 
Wagner said he’d be lying if he 
didn’t say Simpson sets the tone 
defensively.

Simpson knows this. He says 

he’s 
the 
Wolverines’ 
middle 

linebacker on hardwood, where is 
energy is contagious.

“If they see me start doing it,” 

Simpson said, “they’ll start doing 
it.”

On the surface, it’s no surprise 

that Simpson is where he is. That 
power and grit he flashed against 
Livers has helped him become an 
essential part of a Michigan team 
primed for a deep run in the NCAA 
Tournament.

But none of this came easy to 

Simpson. At almost every stage of 
his career, he has been doubted, 
looked over and passed up.

Many 
players 
would 

become 
discouraged 
by 
such 

disappointments. But that’s the 
point: Most players aren’t Zavier 
Simpson. 

***
Back in high school, Simpson 

probably 
irked 
some 
of 
his 

teammates, especially when it 
came time to run.

Quincy 
Simpson, 
Simpson’s 

father and coach his junior and 
senior year at Lima Senior (OH), 
would put 60 seconds on the 
scoreboard. The drill was simple: 
Run 10 lengths of the floor in the 
allotted time — suicide style.

The whistle would blow, and 

the whole team would burst off 
the baseline — with the exception 
of Simpson. He wanted more of a 
challenge, starting after each of his 
teammates had run the first length, 
charging towards them like a mad 
man while yelling in their faces.

“He wouldn’t always win,” 

recalled Lima Senior assistant 
coach Brock Howe. “But he would 
still make it under a minute and 
beat half the team.”

And when his teammates didn’t 

make the time, Simpson would 
really go in. He’d yell for another 
60 seconds to be put on the clock 
repeatedly until all his teammates 
made it. Sometimes, it got to the 
point where even his coaches 
wanted to move on. 

“He would call out every kid 

who didn’t make it like, ‘You’re 
faster than that, you’re faster than 
that,’ ” Howe recalled. “ ‘Man, 
you’re going to state in track, and 
you can’t make this time? Because 
you’re soft.’ ”

It was that type of work ethic 

and 
leadership 
that 
defined 

Simpson’s high school career.

Even when they weren’t at the 

same school, Quincy and Simpson 
would head to the YMCA for 
workouts at six in the morning 
four times a week. And when 
Simpson didn’t think that was 
sufficient, they went even earlier — 
sometimes 5:00 or 5:30.

“Everything that he’s gotten at 

this point has been earned,” Quincy 
said. “He wasn’t blessed with a lot 
of natural abilities, so therefore we 
had to work extra hard.”

Added Howe: “I’ve never seen 

anyone enjoy being in the gym 
more than him.”

It all soon began to pay off. 

Simpson scored 59 and 65 points 
in games during his senior year. 
Scouts crammed into high school 
gyms to watch him play. He was 
rated as a four-star recruit, and the 
offers started to stack up.

For a while, though, there wasn’t 

one from Michigan. Coach John 
Beilein and his staff were instead 
focused on Detroit Jesuit star 
Cassius Winston — their primary 
point guard target for the 2016 
class.

Winston, however, was set on 

Michigan State. That opened the 
door for Simpson to fall in love with 
Michigan and follow the footsteps 
of fellow Ohioans Trey Burke and 
Caris LeVert.

But even as Simpson found a 

home with the Wolverines, he 
wouldn’t forget about Winston — 
the man who could’ve taken his 
spot.

***
Simpson was hesitant to admit 

it publicly before 
the 
semifinals 

of 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament. But 
he craved another 
battle 
with 

Winston. So much 
so that fifth-year 
senior 
forward 

Duncan Robinson 
said Simpson was 
literally 
licking 

his 
fingers 
in 

anticipation of the matchup.

It showed. Simpson was keyed 

in during an emotion-filled affair, 
diving for loose balls and talking 
trash throughout. He held Winston 
to a lackluster 3-for-10 effort, as the 
Wolverines topped the Spartans en 
route to back-to-back conference 
championships.

For all the firepower Winston 

has and all the criticism Simpson 
receives 
for 
his 
offensive 

shortcomings, the stereotypes have 
been flipped in their two matchups 
this season. Winston was stymied 
twice, shooting just 35 percent 
with 22 total points. Simpson, 
meanwhile, scored a combined 31 
points on 9-of-16 shooting.

And therein lies another piece 

to Simpson’s game: he takes every 
matchup personally. It doesn’t 
matter if it’s suicides in a high 
school practice or postseason 
basketball in Madison Square 
Garden.

“I’m not the type of guy who 

likes to get scored on,” Simpson 
said. “When you have pride in your 

defense, you’re not going to be 
passive. You’re going to take things 
personally if you get scored on, 
and you’re gonna try to win your 
matchup.”

That’s something Quincy has 

preached throughout his son’s 
basketball career, emphasizing the 
value of taking the opposing player 
out of the equation.

In an age where point guards 

are becoming more and more 
offensively adept, Simpson is a 
rarity. A look around the country 
and the NBA shows that an efficient 
outside stroke is paramount, and 
youth and high school coaches are 
teaching accordingly.

In that sense, Simpson is an 

old-timer. Defense, not shooting, 

comes first.

“I feel like it’s 

just my mindset 
and 
my 
pride,” 

he said. “Just not 
wanting him to 
score — that’s what 
it 
comes 
down 

to. 
There’s 
no 

secret, no special 
ingredient, 
just 

taking it personal 
and not wanting to 

let him score.”

But with that mindset comes 

aggressiveness — and sometimes 
too much of it.

Simpson 
played 
just 
nine 

minutes per game last season. Of 
course, he was behind a four-year 
veteran star in Derrick Walton. 
But when Simpson saw the court, 
fouls kept him on a short leash as 
he averaged nearly six infractions 
per 40 minutes.

“Last year, we couldn’t put 

him on the floor because he’d foul 
somebody within 30 seconds,” 
Beilein recalled, “and it wouldn’t 
help anybody.”

Though Simpson had moderate 

expectations for his freshman year, 
he didn’t realize being a backup 
would equate to such limited 
playing time — which contributed 
to some apprehensiveness.

Simpson 
seldom 
looked 

comfortable on the floor. He 
couldn’t finish around the rim. His 
offense stalled frequently.

“I always told him there was 

no reason to be timid or second-

guessing himself,” Walton said. 
“We already (thought) he was good 
enough. We know you’re good 
enough.”

Naturally, Simpson’s struggles 

culminated in frustration. Here 
was a player who’d always been the 
best on the floor, now barely seeing 
it.

“It was definitely a hard pill to 

swallow,” Quincy said.

Added Walton: “I told him, ‘I’m 

only here for a couple more months. 
So you only got to deal with this for 
a little longer.’ ”

***
It was supposed to be a 

straightforward progression for 
Simpson. Learn behind Walton for 
a year, then run the show the next.

But a month after Walton 

played his last game in a Michigan 
uniform, Beilein called Simpson 
into his office. The message was 
direct: The coaches hadn’t seen 
enough out of Simpson; they had 
decided to add graduate transfer 
Jaaron Simmons as insurance. 

Suddenly, it seemed like Simpson 

would have to wait another year to 
take the reins. Simmons was a star 
at Ohio, averaging nearly 16 points 
and seven assists per game. He 
possessed the offensive acumen 
the Wolverines had missed with 
Simpson on the floor.

“I had three options,” Simpson 

said. “Beat him and (freshman 
point guard Eli Brooks) out for the 
position, be in-between, or be last.”

Simpson chose the first. Thanks 

to his knowledge of Beilein’s 
complex offensive system, Simpson 
was the starting point guard at the 
onset of the year.

But he wouldn’t be there for 

long. Those fouls crept back into 
his defense. He couldn’t move the 
ball effectively on the other end. 
Beilein thought Michigan’s offense 
had more flow with Brooks. 

So just four games into the 

season, Beilein made the switch. 

“Zavier didn’t earn it,” Beilein 

said. “He was starting because he 
knew more than the other guys, 
and then he wasn’t doing some of 
the intangibles you need.”

It was back to square one for 

Simpson. This was supposed to be 
his opportunity. Yet, a freshman 
had just taken his job.

The possibility of Simpson 

transferring 
seemed 
realistic. 

He already didn’t match Beilein’s 
traditional, 3-point heavy offense. 
Now, he’d been handed another 
roadblock in young career already 
chock-full of frustration.

But that’s not Simpson. He’s too 

hardworking, too competitive to 
quit.

“We 
never 
even 
discussed 

(transferring),” Quincy said. “I 
told him to keep his head up, 
keep working. I told him to be a 
good teammate and challenge 
and compete daily in practice. It’s 
adversity.”

***
After a month of inconsistency 

at the point guard spot, Simpson 
returned to the 
Wolverines’ 
starting 
lineup 

on 
Jan. 
6. 
As 

has 
sometimes 

been 
the 
case 

this 
season, 
his 

performance 
didn’t exactly stick 
out in the box score 
— five points on 
1-for-5 
shooting. 

Still, it was a vote 
of confidence from his coaches — 
one that Simpson needed.

In the games that followed, he 

began to play more freely and, most 
importantly, became a player who 
Beilein could trust to play both 
ways.

“It’s not like the other guys 

flunked the test,” Beilein said. “He 
became a defensive stopper, and 
a guy who was playing winning 
basketball.”

Since taking back the starting 

job, Simpson is averaging almost 10 
points with four assists per game, 
helping Michigan find an offensive 
rhythm it occasionally missed 
earlier in the year.

In 
mid-January, 
when 

Nebraska’s defense stalled the 
Wolverines by switching screens 
— a strategy Beilein anticipated 
others would follow — it looked 
like 
the 
Cornhuskers 
had 

cracked the code to defending 
Michigan. Instead of relying on 
Wagner’s pick-and-pop game, the 
Wolverines needed a slasher to 
keep the opposition honest.

Simpson stepped up. Against 

Purdue’s 
massive 
frontcourt 

two games later, he rendered the 
Boilermakers’ defense ineffective 
with a newfound aggressiveness, 
scoring 
16 
points 
en 
route 

to 
Michigan’s 
best 
offensive 

performance of the season.

“At the beginning of the year, 

he still had some of his rough 
spots,” said assistant coach Saddi 
Washington. “At the point things 
clicked, the game slowed down for 
him, and he really was able to take 
control of the team on both sides 
of the ball. I think that’s when our 
team really started to catch our 
flow.”

Of course, just like in high 

school, 
Simpson’s 
influence 

extends beyond just the floor.

On Feb. 24, Michigan finished 

the regular season on a six-game 
winning streak, capped off by a 
drubbing of Maryland in College 
Park.

During 
the 
next 
practice, 

though, a sleepy feeling loomed 
around the team.

“We were just lethargic,” Beilein 

said.

So Beilein turned to the player 

who could most effectively ignite 
his team. Not captains Duncan 
Robinson 
and 
Muhammad-Ali 

Abdur-Rahkman. 
Not 
Wagner. 

Rather, it was Simpson who Beilein 
called over.

“I talked to Zavier, ‘We need 

you right now, right now,’ ” Beilein 
recalled. “He started getting after 
people a little bit, and practice 
changed.”

From a distance, Simpson is 

reserved — quiet even. In front 
of the media, he contrasts the 
unabashed energy of freshmen 
Jordan Poole and Isaiah Livers, or 
the brashness of Wagner.

But away from the cameras, 

Simpson is the epitome of a vocal 
leader, 
challenging 
teammates 

with 
both 
his 

voice 
and 
play 

throughout 
workouts 
and 

practices.

“I think when 

Derrick left, there 
was a void there, 
and I think he’s 
really 
stepped 

into it,” Robinson 
said. “He’s very 
very vocal, and 

that’s huge for us just because of his 
energy. He’s always talking during 
practice, so I think that’s been big.”

Simpson 
has 
always 
been 

this way. In high school, his dad 
described him as a coach on the 
floor, a coach in the locker room 
and a coach off the floor. Even in 
the summer of 2016, Walton knew 
Simpson had the potential to lead 
the team.

“He was kind of like I was — just 

strong and demonstrative,” Walton 
recalled. “When he’d say stuff, he’d 
mean it.”

***
It was unintentionally fitting.
Simpson, despite consistently 

holding 
the 
conference’s 
best 

point guards below their season 
averages, wasn’t a selection for the 
Big Ten All-Defensive team.

Another day, another look-over.
Simpson, of course, has bigger 

things to worry about. The NCAA 
Tournament starts next Thursday, 
and the Wolverines are trying to 
balance what will be nearly two 
weeks off before since their last 
game.

But if the past is any indication, 

he won’t forget about the snub.

“We were all shocked he didn’t 

get any All-Defensive team love,” 
Washington said. “But because 
(he’s) is such a competitive kid, 
he’ll really use that to motivate 
(himself).”

Such 
has 
been 
the 
case 

throughout Simpson’s career. He 
wasn’t Michigan’s first choice for 
the class of 2016. He barely played 
as a freshman. He wasn’t trusted 
to be the point guard immediately 
after Walton. He was benched in 
the fall.

And yet here he is — the 

Wolverines’ 
definitive 
spark 

plug, leading Michigan its best 
basketball of the year when it 
matters most.

 “Talk about a chip on your 

shoulder,” Beilein said. “He’s got 
the chip now, and that’s really 
been good. … I’m partially guilty of 
putting that chip there, and I want 
to keep it there.

“I’m tough on him, but he always 

responds.”

That’s 
simply 
what 
Zavier 

Simpson does. Just ask Cassius 
Winston.

In Big Ten Tournament Semifinal, ‘M’ faces toughest foe: Buckeyes

Ohio State is a very good 

hockey team.

The Buckeyes are ranked 

sixth in the nation in both the 
USCHO and USA Today polls, 
and fourth in Pairwise. They’re 

11th nationally in scoring and 
fourth in goals against. Their 
power play percentage is better 
than that of all but seven teams, 
and their penalty kill is second to 
none. They’ve won 23 games, lost 
eight and tied five.

“Personally,” said Michigan 

senior forward Dexter Dancs, “I 
think they’re the best team in the 
Big Ten that we’ve played so far.”

Notre Dame may have won the 

Big Ten regular-season title and 
might be ranked ahead of Ohio 
State in every poll. But it’s easy to 
see where Dancs is coming from.

Back in late November, the 

Buckeyes walked into Yost Ice 
Arena and stomped all over the 
Wolverines, leaving with wins 
of 3-2 and 5-1. Two months later, 
Michigan traveled to Columbus 
a different team, coming off 
four straight wins against then-
No. 9 Minnesota and then-No. 
12 Penn State — and Ohio State 
walloped the Wolverines again, 
by a combined score of 9-3.

This Saturday, in the Big 

Ten 
Tournament 
semifinal 

in Columbus (7:30, Big Ten 
Network), they’ll get a chance 
to change that with a spot in 
next 
Saturday’s 
conference 

championship game on the line.

Michigan is rolling right now. 

Two straight wins over the 
nation’s top-ranked team and a 
12-3-1 record in its last 16 games 
prove as much.

But none of those victories 

have 
come 
against 
the 

Wolverines’ fiercest rival.

“We love to hate Ohio State,” 

said 
senior 
forward 
Tony 

Calderone. “So definitely just 
playing them even if we’ve beat 
them already, I think (not having 
beaten Ohio State) gives us a 
little extra fire.”

What makes the Buckeyes just 

so tough? For one, they appear 
to be specifically engineered 
to exploit any and all opposing 
weaknesses. 
Their 
sterling 

statistics with the man advantage 
and when shorthanded attest to 
that.

At the same time, it’s been 

inconsistency and little mistakes 
— such as neutral and defensive-
zone turnovers and meaningless 
penalties — that have cost 
Michigan more than anything 
throughout the season, even 
during its most recent surge. 
The Wolverines’ four losses to 
Ohio State, then, went exactly 
how you might have expected. 
They outshot the Buckeyes, 131-
120, during the season series, but 
allowed five goals on 14 Buckeye 
power plays while failing to 
score on any of their 12 chances.

“That’s 
how 
Ohio 
State 

plays,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson, who stated that 
his 
team 
“beat 
themselves” 

in January’s series. “... (The 
Buckeyes are) very patient and 
they just wait to capitalize on 
your mistakes and they’re very 
good at it. But we just tried to 
do too much. We were getting 
behind and then we pressed, we 
started pressing, and when you 
start pressing sometimes you 
try to do too much and get out of 
position, you play on the offense 
and that’s what happens, you 
turn it over.”

Added Calderone: “We got 

to stay out of the box, we got 
to 
eliminate 
our 
turnovers 

around the blue lines, which is 
something we’ve 
struggled 
with 

recently. 
So 
as 

long as we can 
eliminate 
their 

chances we won’t 
beat ourselves.”

But 
even 
if 

the 
Wolverines 

eradicate 
most, 

if not all, of their 
prior mistakes, it 
may not make a 
difference.

Ohio State possesses a deep 

forward corps, with six in 
double-digit goals this season. 
Their top line — Big Ten Player 
of the Year finalist Tanner 
Laczynski (41 points), Mason 
Jobst (41) and Matthew Weis 

(36) — is one of the few anywhere 
that 
can 
go 
blow-for-blow 

with Michigan’s “DMC” trio of 
Dancs, Calderone and Cooper 
Marody. Sean Romeo (.925 save 
percentage), meanwhile, might 
be the best goaltender in the 
conference 
not 
named 
Cale 

Morris, and is liable to steal any 
game at any time.

“They’re the favorite. To me 

they’re one of the top three, 
four teams in the country, 
easily, easily,” Pearson said. “So 
it’s just like you’re going to be 
playing somebody in the (NCAA) 
Tournament if you get in. Good 
opportunity, 
good 
measuring 

stick for us, and we’ll be ready.”

Now, 
about 
that 
NCAA 

Tournament.

Saturday’s contest begins a 

new phase of the Wolverines’ 
season. 
Their 
previous 
36 

games held no win-or-go-home 
implications — save for the Great 
Lakes Invitational in January. 
But from this weekend on, there 
are no more Friday-Saturday 
matchups. No more best-of-
however-many series. For the 
rest of the season, Michigan 
has only one game at a time to 
achieve its goals.

“You play to win. You can play 

a shorter bench because you only 
have one game,” Pearson said. 

“… So you’re not 
concerned about 
resting guys or 
not giving them 
as much ice time 
because 
you 

know you have 
to play the next 
day. This is it. It’s 
all on the table 
and you don’t 
play again for 
another week. … 

You play for that moment, to win 
that game.”

This game, however, is likely 

the Wolverines’ biggest test of 
the season.

Thus, coming out on top will 

take their strongest performance 
of the season as well.
