Lack of initial report
may have hindered
connection of three
incidents in Zaragon
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily News Editor
A 31-year-old male graduate
atudent la being investigated for
sexually assaulting three females
in three separate incidents, two
of which occurred in September
2012 and the third this February.
The cases - which caused
unease in the University commu-
nity because of repeated assaults
at Zaragon Place - raises con-
cerns about the ability of police
agencies to investigate sexual
assault amid the confidentiality
of internal University investiga-
tions. At the same time, Universi-
ty investigators are charged with
the difficult responsibility of
maintaining a balance between
survivor rights and community
safety
The second reported incident,

which occurred in September
20i2, was discovered during an
internal University investigation
into another sexual assault alle-
gation. University Police were
informed of the first incident but
were not made of aware of the
second until February - there-
fore, they were unable to consider
the second allegation as evidence
for apotential pattern ofincidents
in September.
The University community
was not notified of the allega-
tions until after a third student
was allegedly sexually assaulted
in the same location in February
and University Police determined
there was apossible threatto stu-
dent safety.
Acrime alert detailingallthree
incidents was sent out the night
of Feb. 27 once University Police
established a pattern from the
information they received.
'As soon as we had the infer-
mation that led usto believe it was
a pattern of behavior that posed a
public safety threat and we could
identify where these incidents
allegedly occurred, we issued a

0Business-minded
initiatives a focus
of CSG platforms
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
Daily StaffReporter
Last year, only one Central
Student Government presi-
dential candidate made entre-
preneurship a major platform
point. Manish Parikh, current-

ly a business senior, became
the first independent candidate
to win the CSG presidency in
years. In this year's election,
candidates are taking notice
and building on the current
administration's entrepreneur-
ial efforts. -
Parikh said the perception
of CSG in 20i1 was that of a
"bureaucratic, slow-moving
machine with a lot of cogs in
the system," so his message of
reform appealed to voters.

"I think entrepreneurship,
and more so the entrepreneur-
ial mindset, was extremely cru-
cial for us in the last election,"
Parikh said.
This year has been marked
with several entrepreneurial
programs and events, includ-
ing the Entrepreneurship Com-
mission, the MHacks student
hackathon and the Month of
Entrepreneurship.
"I think (entrepreneurship)
got students on campus really

fired up, that (we) had fresh
thoughts, fresh ideas and that
(we) were willing to flip CSG
around - make it more innova-
tive and focua on (new) projects,"
Parikh said.
Tom Erdmann, an organizer
of MHacks, which took the title
of the nation's largest college
hackathon, said entrepreneur-

How did you come up

ever.
"I had always sort of regarded
myself and my body as something
that could be improved upon,"
Parkinson said. "I've never had
great self-confidence, and so I
saw the show ... and I realized
I'm 18 years old and I've never
seen a part of my body. And so,
I went home, and the next day,
I got down there with a mirror,
and I cried."
"I had never realized how
beautiful that part of my body
was - that it wasn't some-
thing gross or something to be
ashamed of," Parkinson con-
tinued. "After that, I looked at

myself and my body in a com-
pletely different way."
Now, Parkinson has the
chance to be a part of the show
that reshaped her perspec-
tive. On March 21, "The Vagina
Monologues" will be performed
at the University.
Ensler penned the play after
conducting over 200 interviews
with women about their views
and experiences when it comes
to sex, relationships and violence
against women. She teamed up
with producer Willa Shalit and
others to start V-Day, a global
non-profit that raises money
through productions of the
show for women's anti-violence
groups.
The production is presented
by Students For Choice, a stu-

dent organization on campus
that promotes reproductive jus-
tice, and the proceeds will go
to SafeHouse, Ann Arbor's sup-
port center for people impacted
by domestic violence and sexual
assault.
SFC president Carly Manes,
an LSA sophomore, explained
SFC's decision to tackle its first
theater production. While the
organization is typically associ-
ated with advocacy and action
regarding abortion, Manes said
"The Vagina Monologues" fits
into the group's larger purview
of promoting women's sexual
agency.
Manes also explained that
SFC took interest in the show
because of the usefulness of
exploring these issues through
theater.
"I think that it's a way to
engage people without being
threatening," she said.
Beyond hoping to inspire
activism, Manes said she hopes
any members of the audience
who might not identify as femi-
nists will walk away no longer
afraid of the title. Most of the
students acting in the show are
not in SFC - some even came
in with reservations about call-
ing themselves feminists, but
according to Parkinson, the
show can be transformative.
On the first day of rehearsal,
the cast had a long discussion
about themselves and their vagi-
nas, sharing their personal expe-
riences with feminism.
"This one woman comes to
mind: We're sitting around in a
circle and we're talking, and she
says, 'Guys, I don't know any of
this,' " Parkinson said. "She was
embarrassed because she didn't
quite understand some of the
concepts that people were just
throwing out there."
Flash forward a couple of
months. At the end of the show,
the members of the cast all step
forward and say why they are
rising up against abuse of and
violence against women.
Parkinson was struck by what
that same young woman who
admitted to not knowing much
about feminism said at her turn.
"She steps forward, and she
says, 'I'm rising because I'm
learning,' " Parkinson said. "And
it's just been really awesome see-
ing her and other people start

to find their own voice when it
comes to feminism and being
women."
The whole production process
has been an emotional journey,
and Parkinson noted that one of
the distinct challenges is balanc-
ing the show's more humorous
monologues with its very serious
moments.
"Even as recently as yester-
day, I'll sit there and I'll cry
in rehearsal," Parkinson said.
"There are some really, really
serious things that can be very
triggering, very hard-hitting and
hit close to home."
'The Vagina Monologues'
balances its humor delicately,"
she continued. "I think they do
an excellent job of making sure
things that are very serious
aren't being made fun of."
Because of the triggering
nature of the show, LSA senior
and SFC member Aja Weston
came up with the idea to have a
post-production debrief, which
audience members are encour-
aged to attend. A representative
from the University's Sexual
Assault Prevention and Aware-
ness Center will lead the debrief,
but Weston explained that there
isn't a specific structure to the
talk.
"It'll depend on who shows
up and what they want," Weston
said. "We wanted to have a
platform for discussing what
happens next, to continue the
dialogue."
Parkinson, Manes and Weston
all emphasized that they hope
students of all identities and
backgrounds come to the show,
which is by and about women,
but not necessarily just for peo-
ple with vaginas.
"It really goes beyond just
talking about vaginas," Parkin-
son said. "It's not just a group
of people standing up there
describing labias. It's really a
celebration and exploration of
womanhood and femininity, and
I think it applies to everybody."
When asked about what audi-
ences should take away, Par-
kinson recalled her personal
relationship to the show.
"I hope that at least one person
is going to walk away the same
way I did, realizing that they're
beautiful and that there's noth-
ing to be ashamed of for being a
woman and for having a vagina."

Aim to clear up
tensions on key
issues, Iran
JERUSALEM (AP) - Seek-
ing a fresh start to a strained
relationship, President Barack
Obama and Israeli Prime Min-
ister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Wednesday demonstrated soli-
darity on the key issues that
have stirred tensions between
them. The U.S. president vowed
he would do "what is neces-
sary" to prevent Iran from
obtaining a nuclear weapon,
while Netanyahu reaffirmed
that his newly formed govern-
ment seeks a two-state solution
to Israel's decades-long dispute
with the Palestinians.
Obama, in Israel for the first
time in his presidency, also
pledged to investigate reports
that Syria had used chemical
weapons for the first time in
its two-year civil war. And he
sternly warned Syrian leader
Bashar Assad that use of such
weapons would be a "game-
changer," one that could poten-
tially draw the U.S. military
into the conflict for the first
time.
"The Assad regime must
understand that they will be
held accountable for the use
of chemical weapons or their
transfer to terrorists," Obama
said, standing alongside Netan-
yahu at a nighttime news con-
ference.
Expectations were low for a
breakthrough during Obama's
visit on any of the major issues
roiling the region. Instead, the
president was focused on reas-
suring anxious Israelis that he
is committed to their security,
and on resetting his rocky rela-
tionship with Netanyahu. The
two leaders have been at odds
over Israeli settlements and
Iran's disputed nuclear pro-
grams, and Netanyahu famous-
ly lectured Obama in front of
the media in the Oval office on

Obama, Israeli PM
show solidarity

Israel's right to defend himself.
Compared with past encoun-
ters, there was a noticeable lack
of uneasiness Wednesday, the
first time the two leaders have
met publicly after both sur-
vived elections that will leave
them stuck with each other for
the foreseeable future. They
traded jokes throughout a day
of side-by-side appearances.
And they repeatedly referred to
each other by their first names,
Obama calling his Israeli coun-
terpartby his nickname, "Bibi."
On Iran in particular, the
two leaders sought to show
theywere united intheir desire
to prevent the Islamic republic
from developing what Obama
called "the world's worst weap-
ons."
Although preventing Iran
from developing a nuclear
weapon is a priority of both
countries, Netanyahu and
Obama have differed on pre-
cisely how to achieve that goal.
Israel repeatedly has threat-
ened to take military action
should Iran appear to be on
the verge of obtaining a bomb,
while the U.S. has pushed for
more time to allow diplomacy
and economic penalties to run
their course.
Obama said he continues to
prefer a diplomatic solution
and sees time to achieve it.
Whether that works, he said,
will depend on whether Iran's
leaders "seize that opportu-
nity."
Although Obama did not
promise that the United States
would act militarily against
Iran if Israel decided that must
be done, he offered an explicit
endorsement for Israel to take
whatever unilateral measures
it deems necessary to guard
against the threat.
"Each country has to make
its own decisions when it
comes to the awesome decision
to engage in any kind of mili-
tary action, and Israel is differ-
ently situated than the United
States," he said.

ASSAULT
From Page lA
crime alert," University Police
spokeswoman Diane Brown said.
Since Aug. 18, 2011, the Univer-
sity has operated under an interim
sexual misconduct allegation pro-
cedure to investigate allegations
of student sexual misconduct. The
new procedure was put in place
after an April 2011 mandate from
the U.S. Department of Education
was sent to colleges nationwide.
The mandate reaffirms a school's
obligations to investigate claims of
sexual misconduct under Title IX,
the federal anti-sex discrimina-
tionstatute.
"Sexual violence is a form of
sexual harassment prohibited
by Title IX," the mandate states.
"A school that knows, or reason-
ably should know about possible
harassment must promptly inves-
tigate to determine what occurred
and then take appropriate steps to
resolve the situation."
At the University, the Office of
Institutional Equity is responsible
for conducting these investiga-
tions. Allegations of misconduct
can come to OIE from a variety of
sources, including the dean of stu-
dents, the Office of Student Con-
flict Resolution and University
officials.
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the staff of OIE
is made up of "highly trained
investigators" and has experi-
ence looking into other forms of
misconduct, such as discrimina-
tion or harassment by a University
employee.
Fitzgerald said the crime alert
response to the allegations was
appropriate once OIE and Univer-
sity Police had enough informa-
tion.
"There were various levels of
information available, and it didn't
all come together until the most
recent incident was reported,"
Fitzgerald said. "Then what you
saw was swift action on every-
body's part."
According to Fitzgerald,
because the case is still active and
the University is bound by student
privacy laws, not all details can be
disclosed.
After interviewing those
involved and anypossible witness-
es, an OIE investigator determines
whetheT the- accused is guilty.
These investigations are differ-
ent from police inquiries, and the
standard of guilt for an OIE inves-
tigation is lower than that of the
criminal justice system.
Sexual misconduct allegations
against students are generally first
t reported to the OSCR which then

hands the investigation over to
OIE.
While investigating the first
September incident, OIE learned
of a second possible incident
involving another sexual assault
by the same suspect in the
same apartment. It is currently
unknown how much information
OIE knew about the second inci-
dent and why University Police
were not told about it until months
later.
Brown said a crime alert was
not issued for the first incident
because not enough informa-
tion was known at the time and
the survivor did not want to file a
police report. The second survivor
also did not wish to file a police
report or contribute to the OIE
investigation. No police reports
were filed for any of the three inci-
dents until February.
"People cannot be forced in
these kinds of situations to file a
police report," Brown said.
Police reports, which attempt
to get all the facts recorded, are
vital for most police investiga-
tions. Det. Lt. Robert Pfannes of
the Ann Arbor Police Department,
who is investigating the three
allegations, said a person unwill-
ing to file a police report makes it
extremely difficult or even impos-
sible for police to investigate a
crime, especially in cases that
only involve two people.
"We can't investigate some-
thing we don't know happened,"
Pfannes said.
Holly Rider-Milkovich, direc-
tor of the Sexual Assault Aware-
ness and Prevention Center, said
the absence of a police report
does not mean an event didn't
occur. There are many reasons a
survivor might not choose to file
a report, she added, including
not wanting to undergo detailed
questioning by the police or a fear
of not being believed.
"We want survivors to be in
complete control of their story
and to share as much or as little
information as they choose," Rid-
er-Milkovich said.
In the latest incident in Feb-
ruary, the survivor reported
the assault to a University staff
member. The staff member
reported the allegations to Uni-
versity Police on Feb. 21, who
then informed OIE. The survivor
initially declined to file a police
report, but later did so with Ann
Arbor Police.
Once they were made aware
of the third report, OIE investi-
gators discovered a connection
between the incident in Febru-
ary and the September assaults,
Fitzgerald said.
OIE's assertion of a relation-

ship between three incidents sug-
gests that the second incident was
significant enough to be recorded
or remembered by someone in
OIE.
Within a week of being
informed of the third report, Uni-
versity Police issued a crime alert
about all three incidents. Uni-
versity Police are not responsible
for investigating any of the three
crimes because they occurred at
an off-campus apartment, in the
jurisdiction of AAPD.
Pfannes said AAPD was first
notified of all three allegations
by University Police in Febru-
ary. At that time, an investigation
commenced and remains active.
While the AAPD has contacted
the suspect, he has not been
arrested or arraigned.
Maintaining abalance
between survivor rights and
community safety
With the requirement by Title
IX that the University investigate
all claims of sexual misconduct,
questions arise aboutthe extent to
which information is shared with
UniversityPolice.
Generally, OIE discloses crime
allegations to University Police
when they are "Clery-reportable"
- crimes identified in the Clery
Act, a 1990 federal law dictating
how universities must disclose
on-campus crimes, such as rob-
beries and sexual assaults.
The Clery Center for Secu-
rity on Campus is an organiza-
tion that initially lobbied for the
law and aims to prevent crimes
on campus. Abigail Boyer, direc-
tor of communications and out-
reach for the organization, said
the law applies only to crimes
that occurred on campus and in a
few other specified areas, such as
Greek-life houses.
OIE generally reports all Clery
violations, regardless of location,
and then lets University Police
determine if a crime alert is
required.
Crime alerts from the Uni-
versity are commonly issued for
incidents that go beyond those
mandated by law because many
students live off campus, Brown
said. Amajorityofthe crime alerts
issued in 2012 were for off-cam-
pus crimes and would not have
been required by law.
The University considers
OIE a "campus security author-
ity," which means that OIE must
report Clery-reportable crimes
it's aware of that occur in enforce-
ment areas to University Police.
"Even at institutions with a
police department on campus,
a student who is the victim of a

crime may be more inclined to
report it to someone other than
the campus police," the U.S.
Department of Education's Hand-
book for Campus Safety and Secu-
rity Reporting states. "For this
reason, the Clery Act requires
all institutions to collect crime
reports from avariety of individu-
als and organizations that Clery
considers to be 'campus security
authorities."'
In an interview last month, Jay
Wilgus, director of the Univer-
sity's Office of Student Conflict
Resolution said the Clery Act and
other laws help determine what
information is forwarded to law
enforcement, no matter the pref-
erence of the survivor.
"We report all Clery-reportable
violations to police regardless,
and then encourage all students
and all complainants to report
to the police." Wilgus said. "If
we need to report because of the
Clery Act, we will."
At the start of its investigations,
OIE determines whether to notify
University Police. It is unknown if
or how frequently intelligence is
shared as investigations progress.
"OIE works closely with UMPD
and the agencies share informa-
tion as appropriate," Fitzgerald,
the University spokesman wrote
in a follow-up e-mail.
The situation gets more com-
plicated when the survivors want
to remain confidential or do not
want to cooperate with police.
The 2011 letter from the
Department of Education stated
that schools should weigh confi-
dentiality requests against factors
such as "seriousness of the alleged
harassment" and "whether there
have been other harassment com-
plaints about the same individu-
al," such as in the case of the three
alleged assaults at Zaragon.
Brown, the UMPD spokeswom-
an, acknowledged that there can
sometimes be a conflict between
respecting the confidentiality of
victims and protecting the cam-
pus community.
"There is a challenging balanc-
ing act between helping an indi-
vidual maintain their control and
their privacy and preserving their
rights, and protecting the pub-
lic and keeping the community
informed," Brown said.
Rider-Milkovich said survivors
should be the ones to control what
get released.
"In a crime where a person's
ability to make choices and deci-
sions for themselves and control
their own lives has been taken
away - which is the case in sexual
assault - it's very important for
them to make choices about what
happens next."

ticularly the Entrepreneurship
Commission."
He added that this year has
been the first year he's seen
CSG strongly support entrepre-
neurship on campus.
"I think it's really critical
that we continue to build on
that obviously in this election
and the next couple of years,"
Erdmann said.
Erdmann said more students
on campus are starting to iden-
tify as entrepreneurs and start-
ing companies, particularly in
the technology sphere.
Business junior Scott Chris-
topher, president of MPowered
and chair of the E-Commission
chair, is the CSG presidential
candidate with the most first-
hand entrepreneurship expe-
rience. He said that in recent
years, entrepreneurship on
campus has had "peaks and val-
leys," but that in the last year,
the entrepreneurial mindset
has been consistently growing.
"There are many students
across all schools and all majors
who are entrepreneurial and
are starting to say, 'I am entre-
preneurial,"' Christopher said.
One goal in particular for
Christopher is to have CSG
partner with student start-ups.
He mentioned A2 Cribs --- a
website which helps students
sort through off-campus hous-
ing options - as a potential
partner, among others.
LSA freshman Nick Swider,
the presidential candidate for
momentUM, said he wants not
only to keep the Entrepreneur-
ship Commission the most-well
funded CSG commission, but
he also wants to see its funding
increased.
"I think we need to keep
entrepreneurship in the fore-
front," Swider said. "Granted,
don't get too carried away with
things, but at the same time
still make it a pinnacle of what
CSG is doing because it's such a
feather in our cap."

LSA junior Chris Osborn,
the presidential candidate of
forUM, said the party is focus-
ing on "experiential learning"
in entrepreneurship like the
proposed "Flipped Semester"
where students work on self-
directed projects while earning
nine credits.
"Nowadays, it's becom-
ing more and more integral
for students to have experi-
ence-based learning than just
education-based learning,"
Osborn said.
Public Policy senior Alex
Lane of forUM said entrepre-
neurship is in the hands of
entrepreneurs, and that CSG
"can't really make entrepre-
neurship happen." Rather, he
said a forUM administration
would "foster the connections
and programs so students can
do most of it themselves."
Businessjunior Mike Proppe,
the presidential candidate of
youMICH, echoed Osborn,
saying the methods by which
students are taught entrepre-
neurship is changing.
"We have two new regents
who are both small-business
owners, so they understand
this could be where the model
of education is going," he said.
"There is an opportunity for the
University of Michigan to get
ahead on this and start prepar-
ing kids to go out in the world
and have the skills to innovate
and start their own business."
Proppe said youMICH is
looking at the Master of Entre-
preneurship program and see-
ing if similar academic options
can be offered to undergradu-
ates, perhaps with a specific
learning community.
"I think (entrepreneurship
is) an issue that it is rightfully
being brought to the forefront
by students. I think students
recognize the importance of it
they recognize the importance
of innovation," Proppe said. "I
think that's why you see it in a
lot of the student government
campaigns, and it's something
that CSG can have an impact
on."

The month will also include
speeches by Dale J. Stephens,
founder of UnCollege, an initia-
tive promoting unconventional
education, and Shawn Dough-
erty, founder of Mophie, a brand
of in-case mobile chargers.
Student organization ven-

MPowered Connect, which
brings entrepreneurship to
Detroit.

With the help of various
administrators, including Uni-

vice provost for academic and
budgetary affairs, and through
networkingwith individual Uni-
versity schools and colleges and
their respective student govern-
ments, Parikh said he hoped stu-
dents would be "fired up about
entrepreneurship."
"Our goal through the entire
month is to touch every sin-
gle student on campus either
through an e-mail, an event or a
project," Parikh said. "We know
this is bit of an ambitious goal,

incorporate the world's poorest,
small farmers into their global
supply chain for vanilla, which
may end up on your grocery store
shelf," Gayle said.
In addition to public- and pri-
vate-sector business relations,
Gayle discussed women and girls
in poverty and budgeting issues in
non-profits.
Gayle emphasized that CARE
focuses on enacting long-lasting
impact on communities. CARE's
staff members typically hail from
the same area they are working in
and therefore have anunderstand-
ing an area's culture and needs to
provide the best poverty relief.
Gayle discussed a woman from
* Burundi who, in her first time out
of the country, spoke at a confer-
ence about a $2 loan from CARE
that led to her starting a business.
"Just with ripple effects that

had for her family, as a woman
who had been a prisoner of her
own home and a victim of domes-
tic abuse," Gayle said. "It totally
changed the life of her family."
"These things, as small and
simple as they may seem, cause a
whole ripple effect of change and
you see that over and over again."
Cooperation with CARE leads
to the adoption of ideas that may
challengethe community's beliefs.
Gayle mentioned how law passed
in Benin that allowed women to
own land, which, because of the
culture, was not being enforced.
CARE then coordinated with
paralegals to work in the commu-
nity to help locals accept the idea
of women owning land.
Gayle said 90 percent ofCARE's
funds come through donations
from large institutions. These
funds are typically restricted
- that is, CARE cannot decide
where to allocate them within the
company. The other 10 percent,
largely small and personal dona-
tions, is unrestricted. Gayle said

this system makes it difficult for
CARE to recognize administra-
tive costs.
"People will give you funding
for specific projects but you have
to support your infrastructure,"
Gayle said. "I think it's very short
sighted because, ultimately, you
have to maintain that infrastruc-
ture and that platform to be able to
do these programs."
Gayle pointed out that females
make up two-thirds of the world's
illiterate population and, while
they execute 50 percent of agri-
cultural work, they own only 1
percent of the world's farmland
and make up 60 percent of the
extreme-poverty population -
those who earn less than $1 per
day. Moreover, helping a woman
often involves helping a mother
and her children.
"You are able to make intergen-
erational change," Gayle said. "If
you have an impact on the life of
a girl or woman, she will put that
into her family and her family's
outcome will change."

Gayle said 96 percent of women
paid back their CARE loans suc-
cessfully, but noted that research
into this data revealed that women
could be taking out loans for men
and be violently coerced to repay
them.
"Repayment rates are not
the only measure," Gayle said.
"What's happening to the loan?
How are those loans being used?
Are they being used in ways that
actually empower women or not?"
Jimmy Schneidewind, a Public
Policy graduate student, said he
came to the event because of his
interest inhow CARE helps devel-
oping countries economically.
"(Old models include), broadly
speaking, donor countries send-
ing copious amount of money to
international NGO's to implement
some kind of Western agenda,"
Schneidewind said. "I'm inter-
ested to see how she is increasing
country ownership, giving the
recipient countries a greater stake
in them and having a bit of autono-
my in how the money is spent."

Cyprus rules out new bailout plan

Banks expected to
remain closed
until Thesday
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -
Searching for a way out of a crip-
pling financial crisis, officials in
Cyprus on Wednesday pursued
a new bailout strategy that could
include a loan from Russia in
exchange for natural gas leases
and selling off assets from its
most troubled banks.
Cyprus needs to come up with
5.8 billion euros ( $7.5 billion) on
its own in order to secure 10 bil-
lion euros in rescue loans from
international creditors. But the
country's first plan to seize up

to 10 percent of people's bank
accounts failed miserably. Now
officials are trying to limit the
amount of money they need to
take from customer's deposits.
The new "Plan B" could be
voted on as early as Thursday,
three top government officials
said.
The latest move came a day
after lawmakers voted over-
whelmingly against the earlier
plan - a rejection that threw
Cyprus' entire bailout into ques-
tion. That raised the possibil-
ity the country's banks could
collapse, the government would
be unable to pay its bills and
Cyprus could be forced out of the
euro.
That could roil global finan-

cial markets as well as endanger
deposits in the country even fur-
ther.
The new "Plan B" was
described by three top govern-
ment officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because
details of the proposal were not
being released until party offi-
cials had a chance to review them
at a meeting Thursday morning.
The package includes a pro-
posal to restructure Cyprus'
heavily indebted second-largest
lender, Laiki. The idea would be
to isolate the bank's bad assets,
which would be taken over by the
government, from its good assets,
which could be sold off to raise
money. That strategy could also
be applied to the country's biggest

lender, Bank of Cyprus.
To avoid bank runs and give
officials time to push the pack-
age through, the country's banks,
which have been shuttered since
Saturday, will remain closed for
the rest of the week, said the cen-
tral bank spokeswoman, Aliki
Stylianou. Monday is a bank
holiday, so banks will not reopen
before Tuesday.
Cyprus has turned to long-
time ally Russia for help, and
Finance Minister Michalis Sar-
ris was in Moscow on Wednes-
day to discuss a range of aid
options and vowed to remain
there until he secured a pledge
of support. "We will be here
until some kind of agreement is
reached," Sarris said.

forUM platform commits to activism and student life
common complaint of Central Student Government -
one the Daily's editorial board has echoed year after year
- is that CSG isn't relevant to students because students
don't know about it, nor do they care. After CSG President Man-
ish Parikh's year in office, however, we feel comfortable saying
that more students are aware of CSG and understand the tangible
changes the assembly can bring to campus. Moving forward, CSG
should redirect its purpose, focusing on policies that can change
the face of the University. While many of the CSG presidential and
vice-presidential candidates brought up inconveniences they'd like
to remedy, such as more printing for LSA students and an app for
MCards, one party stood out in its commitment to solving every-
day problems students regularly face, while concentrating on goals
that might significantly change a student's university experience.
The Michigan Daily's editorial board endorses forUM candidates
for CSG president and vice president because of party's dedication
to both social change and daily student struggles.

Clad in Native American rega-
lia and covered from head
to toe in war paint, the lat-
est "braves" ran
around in front
of the Hatch-
er Graduate
Library. As hun-
dreds of students
looked on, Mich-
igamua initiated
its latest class KEVIN
of members as MERSOL-
part of its annual BARG
rope-in. The year
was 1939.
This scene
repeated itself for most of the last
century. Founded in 1902, Mich-
igamua, one of the University's self-
described senior honor societies,
fashioned itself as an imagined all-
male Native American tribe. Over
time, public outcry put the kibosh on
most of Michiagamua's overtlyoffen-
sive and discriminatory practices.
In breach of agreements against
it, Michigamuacontinued to misap-
propriate Native American culture
and reinforce painful stereotypes
into the 21st century. And it didn't
admit women into its ranks until the
University's Dean of Students forced
them to in 1999.
In a move to distance itself fromits
past, Michigamua changed its name
to the order of Angell in 2007. Today,
whether or not its members realize it,
the organization faces an existential
crisis: Should it still exist?
To answer this question, some
background is in order.
The Order of Angell serves as a
window into the past, a vestige of
student life from more than a cen-
tury ago. Student societies were
all the rage on campus in the first
decade of the 20th century. These
exclusive organizations brought
together like-minded individuals,
and, according to Wilfred Shaw,
former editor of Michigan Alumnus

magazine, membership "reflected
not so much scholastic attainment
as personal popularity."
Societies sprung up in depart-
ments across the University; these
included the Alchemists who stud-
ied chemistry and the Druids who
studied literature. Two senior soci-
eties lasted to the present day: the
order of Angell and the engineer-
ing society, vulcan. Together with
a third all-female society, Adara
- known as Phoenix today - the
three societies occupied floors five
through seven of the Michigan
Union's tower until 2000.
Each year, the Order of Angell, the
most prominent of the tower societ-
ies, invites its incoming "pride" of
about two dozen leaders through
an application-less process known
as "tapping." The group claims to
recruit the most distinguished lead-
ers on campus, provide a forum
to discuss campus issues and spur
"humble" leadership. In addition,
members can benefit from its con-
nection to accomplished alumni who
participated in the organization.
Once we scrape away abandoned
practices, one strand in particular
ties Michigamua of the past to the
order of Angell of the present: self-
congratulatory elitism.
When it distanced itself from its
racist past, the Order of Angell lost
part of its identity. It had for so long
mocked Native Americans that in
many respects shaped its unique and
disturbing place on campus.
And when the University forced
the organization to accept women
into its ranks, it once more lost its all-
male identity. Since Congress passed
Title IX into law in 1972, student
organizations can neither discrimi-
nate against women nor otherwise
exclude them. However, Michigamua
flouted this law for decades and
would likely have remained an all-
male group had the University not
finally intervened 26years later.

Having shed much of its racist
and discriminatory practices, what
purpose does the Order of Angell
serve? It allows a select few to meet
regularly. And for the rest of campus,
it stands as a constant reminder of
the practices and attitudes that hurt
a minority community and the cam-
pus at large. It provides a window to
a past to which student organizing
shouldn't return.
However, we can take positive
steps forward. First, the Order of
Angell should disband and similarly
elitist, self-congratulatory group
organizations should consider doing
the same.
The Order of
Angell must
disband, along with
other elitist groups.
And in their place, we should
build spaces for student leaders to
meet over a sustained period, estab-
lish strong relationships and engage
in dialogue about pressing campus
issues. We can develop a program
that strives towards similar goals as
the present day Order of Angell with-
out the baggage of the past. More-
over, this endeavor would provide .*
an inclusive experience for student
leaders, one that societies like Order
of Angell fail to provide.
Never again, I hope, will students
find it acceptable to parade around
campus in culturally insensitive
ways. Instead, I long for a future
where student leaders cast aside cul-
turally destructive groups and con-
nect through inclusive forums.

MomentUM is unique in that their presiden-
tial candidate, Nick Swider, is an LSA freshman.
While he brings a fresh set of eyescto CSG, as evi-
denced in his desire to give LSA students more
printing and increasing bus services between
North and Central Campus on weekends, a
representative, rather than a president, could
work to remedy these problems. While being a
freshman may offer a distinctive perspective, it
doesn't necessarily foster the ability to recog-
nize long-standing flaws that upperclassmen
may understand more deeply. With more time
on campus, we're confident that Swider can
continue develop his platform, along with his
awareness of the diverse issues that affect the
University. But the role of CSG president is not a
learning experience and requires a leader with
a serious understanding of campus.
The presidential and vice presidential can-
didates from youMich, Michael Proppe and
Bobby Dishell, offer clearly defined objec-
tives for their campaign, such as developing a
survey that links students to organizations of
interest and bringing a 24-hour caf6 to North
Campus. However, their proposed plan seems
more quantitative than qualitative in nature
- a laundry list of tasks, rather than a vision.
Furthermore, the long-term goals offered by
youMich, like an entrepreneurial learning
community angled towards engineering and
business students, fail to meet the needs of
students on a larger scale. Though the MCard
mobile app and student organization survey
they promise may be practical proposals,
these are goals which could be accomplished
through active participation in CSG. The via-
bility of youMich's platform, however, is cer-
tainly strong, and forUM should take note of
Proppe and Dishell's feasible goals.
Independent candidates Scott Christopher
and Ethan Michaeli also offer a wide-reaching
platform with a variety of issues covered. Their
primary goal - expanding and improving the
University's Counseling and Psychologist Ser-
vices - touches on an important issue that has
been largely ignored by other candidates. Their
plan to reduce crime in Ann Arbor through
reforming mental health resources on campus,
however, lacks a direct path to implementation.
From promising shuttle service for graduate
students to and from job interviews to allow-
ing current students to have the first read on
prospective University applications, complet-
ing the tasks in Christopher and Michaeli's
platform would be a reach. The breadth of their
goals leaves us uncertain in terms of what they
would accomplish in a year.

As their name suggests, the Defend Affirma-
tive Action Party also brings a specific platform
to the race, with a focus on one main objective
- bringing affirmative action back to campus.
Presidential candidate Ashley Garrick and her
vice-presidential running mate Chene Karega
both have significant activist experience on cam-
pus, and offer a strong vision of social justice to
the campaign. To say their objectives are impor-
tant would be an incredible understatement, as
underrepresented minority enrollment at the
University continues to decline. However, their
platform, which includes an upcoming march
on Washington D.C. and campus-wide dialogues
on racism, is too specific for CSG leadership. The
president of CSG must represent the interests of
all students, and while a commitment to affir-
mative action is prevalent among some students,
others may be more interested in longer dining
hall hours and other immediate goals. More-
over, the bureaucratic nature of CSG might actu-
ally impede the candidates' ability to enact the
change they desire, as they become inundated in
studentorganization funding forms and meeting
minutes. The goals of DAAP are commendable,
and while they may not be the right fit for CSG
leadership, we hope they continue the fight for
equalityon and offcampus.
Of all the parties running in this year's elec-
tion, forUM strikes the best balance between
tangible goals and dedication to fostering a
socially aware campus. Presidential candidate
Chris Osborn has significant CSG experience,
serving as CSG treasurer under Parikh. Hay-
ley Sakwa, Osborn's running mate, hasn't been
involved in CSG, leaving the pair with both
fresh eyes and a seasoned understanding of the
body. The commitment of forUM to givingstu-
dents a greater role on campus, as made clear
through their plan to introduce a non-voting
student seat to the Board of Regents, suggests
that the party cares about empowering stu-
dents outside of CSG committees. From bring-
ing in more local food on campus to increasing
the University's connection with Detroit,
forUM's platform molds activist visions into
achievable goals. While forUM lacks certain
provisions of the other candidates, such as
mental health reform and mentorship with
local high school students, their well-defined
plan and commitment to working within and
outside the CSG structure suggests openness
to new ideas.
For this year's election, The Michigan
Daily's editorial board endorses CHRIS
OSBORN and HAYLEY SAKWA for CSG
president and vice president.

Should connecting to the Inter-
net in the United States be a battle
in 2013? The short answer: prob-
ably not.
For students in Ann Arbor liv-
ing off campus, capitalism begets
two options for home Internet. It's
choice between companies both
famous for their incompetence:
Comcast, with such a dismal repu-
tation that they've slowly rebrand-
ed as Xfinity while hoping you
didn't notice, and AT&T, which
seemed to think I was irrational
for attempting to trade money in
exchange for Internet in my apart-
ment (it took three months, but we
sorted it out).
The Internet market in the United
States is in disarray. Because laying
thousands of miles of wiring and
infrastructure is expensive, a natu-
ral oligopoly occurs, but the market
that has resulted isn't best serving
the country. With little competition,
the companies haven't been chal-
lenged to improve nearly any aspect
of their business. Customer service
- or lack thereof - aside, the state
of U.S. Internet speed and accessi-
bility has broad implications for our
nation's competitiveness and reflects
an underdeveloped federal strategy.
In 2011, a study done by Netflix
implies a suggestion for those who
just want to binge watch "30 Rock"
without endless buffering: Move to
Canada. When the world's largest
videostreaming company measured
Internet speeds, it found Canadian
top and average download speeds
beat the United States.
Our Northern neighbor isn't the
only one that has us beat. For truly
fast Internet, you'll need to leave
the continent. In NetIndex's cur-
rent rankings of worldwide Internet
speeds, the United States sits in 34th

place with 13.04-megabyte-per-
second downloads, one spot behind
Canada. The top 10 includes Hong
Kong (44.71 mbps), South Korea
(34.72 mbps), Switzerland (30.16
mbps) and the European Union with
the best overall average.
The geographic concentration
of high-speed access is also cause
for concern. Private companies
have little incentive to wire rural
parts of America, which is a dis-
advantage for health care, schools
and businesses in these regions.
President Barack Obama's stimulus
attempted to address this through
the $4-billion Broadband Technol-
ogy Opportunities Program. How-
ever, a recent article in The New
York Times highlighted that the
program has had trouble getting
off the ground in many states and
is plagued with waste and fraud
where it has.
Policymakers and Internet advo-
cates have long recognized this
impediment to U.S. competitive-
ness. In 2013, a business is as fast as
its Internet, and a city's attractive-
ness to new startups is indisputably
linked to high-speed availability.
An example: When Google decid-
ed to have cities compete to be guin-
ea pigs in its fiber experiment, it's
obvious why officials in Topeka, Kan.
changed the city's name to "Google"
as part of their bid. The economic
benefit of the fiber optics, which offer
one-gigabyte-per-second down-
loads, spurs the imagination and
innovation of entrepreneurs. The
startup scene in Kansas City, Kan.,
which became the first Google Fiber
hub, has already been invigorated.
And while providers tout high
-speed broadband connections in
multimillion-dollar advertising
campaigns, availability is limited

and price prohibitive - nearly a
third of Americans opt not to pay
for in-home, high-speed Internet.
According to the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Devel-
opment, 70 percent of Americans

South Korea: 94 percent.
In the 1990s, South Korea priori-
tized Internet literacy and connec-
tivity - policies that have proven
impressively effective. While South
Korean youth have a well-docu-
mented Internet addiction and
population density plays a part, the
United States needs to develop a
similar long-term strategy soits cit-
izens can build the next Facebooks
and Googles and, more important-
ly, watch 70 episodes of "The West
Wing" in a row without issue.
For starters: Push for open
access to allow companies to share
basic infrastructure, curb the
20-state trend of wealthy providers
lobbying to prohibit local competi-
tive markets, and invest heavily in
infrastructure and providing low-
interest loans to do so. Introducing
competition into the stagnant mar-
ket could have incalculable impact.
Programs like the stimulus-funded
one are a good start, but one-time
investments aren't a substitute for a
clear roadmap.
Americans shouldn't be picking
between the lesser of two evils for
a service that's intrinsic to daily life
and economic prosperity. The Unit-
ed States shouldn't be content with
34th place. As a nation, we've long
seen the value of connecting people,
places and ideas. We must recognize
that, like our bridges and roads, our
cyber infrastructure is falling into
disrepair and needs attention.

Thursday, March 21, 2013 - SA

n the rear of a Mississauga
Ont. home, there's no fro-
zen pond for a young Cana-
dian athlete to skate around, nor
a pool for kids to enjoy in the
summertime. Instead, a green
and red, half-length basketball
court sits in the yard waiting for
someone to pick up a basketball
and play.
Lined by a fence and sur-
rounded with trees, the court
was built in lieu of a swimming
pool or a putting green. The two
boys at that house just loved
to play hoops - it was an easy
choice.
It's an unfamiliar sight for
a household in a nation where
hockey dominates youth sports,
but at this house, in place of a
hockey stick or helmet, there are
basketballs and a backyard hoop.
Welcome to Nik Stauskas' play-
ground.
Basketball has always been a
large part of the Michigan fresh-
man guard's life - his brother,
Peter, and his father, Paul, both
played hoops. Both had immense
influence on his life. But then
there's the backyard court where
Nik would spend hours a day
working on his game.
He'd go out there to shoot
or play some one-on-one and
relentlessly practice shooting
drills there on Christmas and
Thanksgiving.
It's on that court where Nik
became one of the best shooters
in Canada.
None of that would've hap-
pened if he didn't have that
backyard hoop. So when most
Canadian boys were tying their
skates, Nik was spending his
time perfecting his shot - a shot,
and a game, that took over his
life.
For Nik, choosing basket-
ball as his sport of choice
took a matter of moments.
Nik joined Ausra Sports Club
in Toronto, a Lithuanian basket-
ball team coached by his uncle,
Vic Simkus, when he was 7
years old. Joining a bunch of his
friends that he knew from Lithu-
anian Saturday school, Nik was
introduced to his first taste of
organized basketball.
Paul had played in the same
league when he was younger, so
Nik was bound to join at some
point. And it helped that Nik was
tall for his age.

So as a part of his first team,
Nik and Ausra Sports Club trav-
eled across the United States to
play against . other Lithuanian
club teams, and Nik loved play-
ing games with his friends from
school.
Then Nik began to take to the
court on a regular basis. In 2002,
the summer before fourth grade,
Nik started working on his shot.
Every day, he'd go outside for
three or four hours to shoot
and dribble by himself. Nobody
forced him to practice - Nik just
played for the love of the game.
And Halloween 2003 sold him
on his newfound passion. Nik, in
fifth grade at the time, went to
a Toronto Raptors game at the
Air Canada Centre. The Raptors
were holding an open practice
for fans before playing the Wash-
ington Wizards that night.
Sitting front row at open prac-
tice, Nik was approached by a
team official and asked if he'd
want to shoot around with Vince
Carter, and of course, the elated
10 year old agreed. Nik went on
to sink a 3-pointer and a couple
of free throws against one of his
favorite players, and after that,
he knew he wanted to play in the
NBA.
"The crowd cheering and him
playing with one of his child-
hood idols put him over the top
and fell in love," Paul said. "From
that point on, he literally didn't
go anywhere without a basket-
ball."
Since he was so tall in ele-
mentary school, Nik didn't
really have to work on the
aesthetics of his shot. If the ball
went in, his coaches were happy.
So Nik just chucked the ball up.
"Back then, I had a really
weird and awkward form," Nik
said. "It was a really ugly shot
but it would go in. Up until high
school, I was shooting with two
hands. It worked, but it was a
really weird-looking shot."
Paul understood that elemen-
tary-school boys weren't big or
strong enough to shoot the ball
with one hand, but Nik contin-
ued this form into middle school.
Even as he got stronger, Nik was
still shooting with two hands at
age 13.
Both Paul and Nik knew that if
Nik was going to continue on in
the basketball world, the weird-
looking shot had to go.

So when Nik would go out-
side to work on his shot, Paul
followed. While Nik started to
work on shooting with one hand,
Paul gave pointers. While Nik
did shooting drills, Paul was his
rebounder. While Nik worked
on his range, Paul was there to
catch his airballs.
Even as early as fifth grade,
Nik impressed coaches. When
Nik joined an AAU squad, Grass-
roots Canada coached by Ro
Russell and Anthony Otto, they
immediately noticed Nik's drive
and had him compete in intra-
squad games against some of the
older players.
Nik would face guys like
Tristan Thompson, a former
Texas center now with the
Cleveland Cavaliers, and Myck
Kabongo, a sophomore guard for
the Longhorns, in practice.
Though he was challenged,
Anthony could see how badly
Nik wanted to improve.
"We sat down with Nik and
told him, 'Obviously, you're not
blessed with the genetics some
of these other guys have, but that
means you need to work harder
in other areas, make up for the
deficiencies.' " Anthony said.
"There are many ways to play
this game (and) he took to that
philosophy, and it worked really
well for him."
Nik was tall at the time - he
eventually grew to 6-foot-6 -
but playing against bigger, stron-
ger players had always given
him trouble. So he learned bet-
ter ways to drive to the lane and
started to perfect his outside
shot.
Whether it was staying after
practice, getting individual
attention from Ro or Anthony
during practice, or the hours
spent in his backyard taking shot
after shot, Nik wouldn't stop
working. Ro called him a "gym
horse."
"A gym rat is too small for
him," he said "You always have
to tell him to leave the gym
because they have to turn the
lights off. So fine, he'll go home
and go outside and be out there
for hours upon hours."
That extra work paid off. In
the Adidas Super 64 AAU Tour-
nament in Las Vegas during Nik's
junior year, the team was down
by 10 points in pool play. Facing
a team that knew how to defend
Nik - they were faceguard-

ing and putting more physical
defenders on him - Ro called his
star over during a timeout.
He told Nik that he had to
make the plays and take over the
offense if they wanted to win the
game.
"You're our guy," Ro said.
"You have to come through for
us this game."
And, like always, Nik came
through.
"The biggest thing was you
could push Nik," Ro said. "You
could yell at him, get in his face,
push him to the highest level,
and he's not going to lose his
confidence or be disrespectful
and talk back. His coachabil-
ity was the biggest thing - you
could always coach Nik and tell
him what needs to be done. 'Yes
coach, I got you,' he said. That
was his favorite line. And he
would get you."
Even though his coaches
thrust the playmaking responsi-
bilities on Nik, nerves or lack of
confidence weren't ever issues
for him. "It's just hoops," Nik
would say:"It's just basketball."

and then we'd instill it in himnso
he'd believe it in himself more."
The confidence started to
appear in middle school. Nik
and the Monarchs were playing
for the Ontario Basketball Asso-
ciation Championship, down two
points with seconds left. The
coaches drew up an inbounds
play and the ball would go Nik -
he would hit a 3-pointer, and the
game would be over.
It worked, and the Monarchs
won.
"For me, it's not just, 'OK,
he hit the shot,' " Paul said. "It
proved to me at that point he
wasn't scared of being in the
limelight, taking the important
shot and he wasn't going to fold
under pressure. I knew he had
the confidence in his shot, and
from th a oint on. he nlaed

aggressively with confidence
and I never saw fear in his eyes
again."
And it's never disappeared.
ik had no idea what he
was getting into when
he went to St. Mark's
Preparatory School in Southbor-
ough, Mass.
After spending a terrible year
in 2010 at South Kent School
(Conn.), where Nik was sidelined
with an injury and was benched
when he recovered, Nik and his
dad contacted David Lubick, the
basketball coach at St. Mark's,
whom they had met at an AAU
tournament the year before.
Dave noticed Nik's talent and
immediately wanted him to play
at St. Mark's, but having already

A fter years of being chai- -"
lenged by older, tougher m - - . a
players and putting
countless hours into working on Ifiterested ease cal or emai
his shot, Nik gained swag. Psychstudy med.umich.edu
"He learned he could go at
whoever, it didn't really matter,"
Anthony said. "That really devel-
oped in his junior year of the
AAU circuit, where he was going
at a lot of tough guys and having
tremendous results."
Ro and Anthony kept feeding 2 1 6 9 5
Nik positive reinforcement, and
they could see it reflected in his 8 1 5 3 2
shot. Nik became the best shoot-
er on the team and a natural 5

his junior year, Nik wasn't only
the best shooter on the team, 7 8

increased his senior year. Nik 3
was the only returning player
from the previous year's U-17 7
team, so Ro and Anthony knew
Nik would be the natural leader 7v8 4 9
of the team's offense.
"We built the team around

From Page 5A
agreed to attend South Kent,
Nik had to decline.
Nik found he didn't like South
Kent, so he gave Dave a call.
"That guy's foolishness not
playing Nik Stauskas was my
good fortune," Dave said.
But when Nik arrived at St.
Mark's, he was in for a surprise.
Dave was a calm man off the
court - Nik said his calmness
is reflected in his love for jazz
music - but in the gym, Dave is
"insane." Paul compares him to
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
Dave challenged Nik on
offense, making him not only a
deadly shooter, but a team player
as well.
St. Mark's featured a bevy of
other talented players, so Nik
didn't have to run the offense and
take every single shot. Dave said
that one thing he instills in his
players is that a bad shot is like
a turnover - something easily
avoided by finding the best shot
for the team.
But Dave knew that at certain
points, he had to let his best play-
ers create offense for themselves
in some situations.
He saw that ability in Nik, and
he kept pushing Nik to become
a better, smarter player. Instead
of destroying Nik's confidence,

like brash instruction might have
for most players, Nik took Dave's
instruction as a challenge.
"He definitely pushed me in a
lot of ways," Nik said. "Coming in,
I hated playing defense. I hadn't
really ever played defense at all,
and he made sure every time I
stepped on the court, I didn't play
unless Iplayed defense."
Dave said he had to "pound it
into him" because he wasn't used
to playing much defense.
"I remember after the very
first practice, he came to us the
next day and said 'I won't be able
to go today because my knees
really hurt,' " Dave said. "We just
laughed at him and said, 'Nik, get
ready, your knees are going to
hurt the rest of your life.'
"If you're a basketball player,
they're going to hurt. So we asked
him, 'When's the last time you
did running like we did yester-
day?' He said never, and we said,
'That's why your knees hurt, so
start learning.'"
As one of the underdogs
in the Adidas Super
64 Tournament in Las
Vegas, the Grassroots Canada
squad wasn't expected to make it
far. But after seeing Nik dominate
the opponents, Ro and Anthony
knew.
"We won some gruelinggames,
and he brought us all the way to
the semifinals," Ro said. "After

that, the fact that he was able to
put the team on his shoulders,
that's when me and coach Huggy
knew. After that tournament, we
talked about it and said, 'This kid
is going to be an impact player in
college and had an opportunity to
go in the NBA.'
Dave knew even before Nik
went to St. Mark's.
"It was an AAU game," he said.
"(Nik) was playing with some
pretty elite AAU teams, and I
was on the bench and pulled the
bench - tried every single kid on
the team to guard him. One after
another, I said, 'Stop him. Don't
let him shoot threes and don't let
him attack the basket.' Every time
they backed off because (if before)
he came down and dunked, he hit
a deep three (the next time).
"He was just killing us. We just
couldn't stop him, and I thought,
'Wow, he's one of the most skilled
players I've seen.'"
And Nik knew he was going to
make it, too. Nik bred confidence
on whatever court he played, and
between his junior and senior
seasons at Grassroots and St.
Mark's, Nik knew he'd be able to
make it to a successful Division I
program and continue to work at
his dream of making the NBA.
After all the work he's put in at
the Player Development Center
during Michigan basketball prac-
tices, Nik hasn't forgotten where

Freshman guard Nik Stauskas honed his skills as a shooter through countless hours on a backyard court in Mississauga, Ont.

his love for basketball began.
During winter break this past
year, Nik went back to that back-
yard court for a short workout on
Christmas Eve. Nik was attempt-
ing to make 45-of-50 3-point
shots, and Paul was his rebound-
er.

It was just like old times.
But instead of Paul having to
correct Nik's two-handed form,
Nik's now a better shooter with
a crisp, smooth release. And Paul
doesn't have to catch any airballs
anymore.
Though Nik's in Ann Arbor for

most of the year working with the
Michigan coaches, he never gives
up an opportunity to go play on
his backyard court.
In the backyard, he's the same
player as always - a determined,
confident shooter that fell in love
with the sport on that same court.

Road to fourth straight conference title starts Saturday

Women's tennis
team faces tough
Big Ten slate in
four-peat attempt
By JASON RUBINSTEIN
Daily Sports Writer
The Michigan women's ten-
nis team has won three consecu-
tive Big Ten titles and is looking
to keep its streak alive.
The Wolverines (1-0 Big Ten,
9-3 overall) have already won
a Big Ten match this season,
sweeping Michigan State, but
that was in the middle of the
non-conference dual-match
season. Big Ten season official-
ly begins this weekend for the
Wolverines, marking a start to a

very difficult stretch.
"The Big Ten is stacked with
really good teams," said Michi-
gan coach Ronni Bernstein.
"Every team is going to be gun-
ning for us and we need to be
ready for each match."
With four teams ranked
inside the top 20, it's crucial
for Michigan not to get ahead
of itself. This year's dual-match
season has proven that rankings
don't earn victories.
"We can't look past anybody
(in the Big Ten)," Bernstein said.
"College tennis, this year, is one
where you see tons of upsets. If
you look at the national results,
you will see some surprises, and
we just don't want to be sur-
prised."
Added sophomore Emina
Bektas: "Everyone is fighting
for the Big Ten title. It doesn't

matterTen
what team
it is. Even
if they have March 23.............
zero wins, March 24.............
you always March 30.............

M ichigan April 21...............
has been
playing its
best tennis going into the Big
Ten season and will look to use
that to its advantage. The Wol-
verines have played a rigor-
ous schedule, but no opponent
defeated Michigan handily. The
highlight of non-conference play
was when the Wolverines upset

But in the
vs. Nebraska first weeks
vs. Iowa of the season,
vs. Penn State Michigan
@ Ohio State struggled to
find the right
doubles com-
binations. The Wolverines have
since solved that issue, though,
winning the doubles point in
their last three matches.
The pair of Bektas and junior
Brooke Bolender headlines the
Wolverines' lineup. The nation's
No. 2 pair is 7-1 at the top spot

and is always looked to for a vic-
tory.
"We know each other well
and know where we will be posi-
tioned on the court at all times,"
Bektas said. "We complement
each other well and have tons of
experience together."
Added Bernstein: "They've
taken it to another level. They
are solid at the net and play
unlike any other doubles team
in the country. They are very
aggressive, and I don't know if
any other team plays like that -
teams don't see that."
The success doesn't end with
the doubles.
Michigan is stacked in its
singles lineup and boasts three
top-100 players.
The singles lineup is solid
upfront with freshman sensa-
tion Ronit Yurovsky, Bektas and

sophomore Sarah Lee.
Playing at both the first and
second spots, Yurovsky has
faced tough opponents, and only
once has she come out on the
losing end.
Yurovsky has gotten more
aggressive throughout the year,
taking more shots out of the air
and controlling the net.
With such a solid, deep lineup
the Wolverines are most defi-
nitely in the running for a fourth
consecutive Big Ten title.
"I expect the (Big Ten season)
to be tough," Bernstein said. "It
is going to be a grind. When you
play a Big Ten match, the energy
is different and we need to be
ready for every match."
Michigan starts the confer-
ence season Saturday when its
travels to Madison to take on
Wisconsin.

Moffie pass embodies
hot transition offense

TODD NEEDLE/Daily
Michigan coach Kim Barnes Arico called the eight-nine matchup "incredibly tough." Michigan will meet Villanova Saturday.
Wolverines trying not to
peek ahead to Stanford

By MICHAEL LAURILA
Daily SportsEditor
Sometimes all it takes is one
pass to score in transition.
The transition game starts in
either the neutral zone or the
defensive zone, but when senior
forward Kevin Lynch scored
the Michigan hockey team's
first goal on a breakaway dur-
ing Saturday's 5-1 victory over
Western Michigan, the play
started deep in the Wolverines'
own zone.
Junior defenseman Jon Mer-
rill made a safety pass back to
senior defenseman Lee Moffie,
who then immediately found
a streaking Lynch down the
ice. With a perfectly timed
and well-placed pass, the puck
landed directly on Lynch's stick
mid-stride. The play wasn't
completely over though, as
Lynch had to bury the break-
away chance past Bronco goal-
tender Frank Slubowski, but it
started behind the Wolverines'
blue line. It was the epitome of
a transition goal.
"(Lynch) was coming off the
bench and he skated hard," said
Michigan coach Red Berenson.
"He demanded the puck with
speed, and that's something
we're always talking about.
Don't just stand there because
you're too easy to cover. He was
on the fly, and Moffie gave him
a perfect pass."
Michigan has scored in tran-
sition this year, but against
Western Michigan it seemed
that the defensemen and for-
wards alike communicated
better than usual, while antici-
pating where the puck needed
to be.
Getting the fast-break
offense going can be important

to control the flow of the game,
and as was the case on Satur-
day, it can result in an early
goal that changes the momen-
tum. Michigan has had bigger
issues to focus on this season
than pushing the puck for those
transition goals, though.
"We have a lot of our neu-
tral-zone drills where we're
either forechecking or we're
transitioning the puck and
attacking," Berenson said. "It's
something I think that this is
the time of year where, hope-
fully, everything you've worked
on this year starts falling into
place."
And the ability to get out into
transition isn't one individual's
job. It's a combination of the
defensemen seeing the entire
ice and predicting the best spot
to send the pass, and also the
forwards maintaining posses-
sion if the puck makes it that
far.
"Half of it's on me to get open
and be there with the right
speed, and the other half is just
for the defenseman to see me
and make that play," said junior
forward Luke Moffatt. "It has
to do with both people."
Moffie's pass to Lynch, for
example, never would've hap-
pened without the combination
of the forwards and defense-
men. Lynch made an impressive
play to beat Slubowski, and as
Berenson said, Moffie "thread-
ed the needle."
And sometimes when the
pass isn't there, the defensemen
are forced to carry the puck up
themselves.
On one of freshman Jacob
Trouba's two goals Friday night
in Kalamzaoo, he single-hand-
edly carried the puck from the
neutral zone into the Broncos'

zone and ripped a slap shot for
a goal. This isn't an everyday
play, but Trouba has been a
force to reckon with all season
on the fast break. He has eas-
ily been Michigan's best rush-
ing defensemen, and this has
allowed him to set up plays and
score goals in transition.
When the pucks get dumped
into the Wolverines' zone, the
goalie can play a pivotal role in
starting the offensive transition
with a nicely placed pass. But
freshman goalie Steve Racine,
who has gone 7-0-1 in his past
eight games said that he is "not
the best puck-handler."
Berenson, though, believes
that as Racine has gotten more
comfortable and confident this
past month, his passing ability
has also improved, especially
last weekend against Western
Michigan.
"He just has to pick his
spots," Berenson said. "When
the puck gets dumped in, he
didn't try and overplay the
puck, and that was good."
Michigan's transition game
is one of many areas that have
improved as the Wolverines
have started to play better over-
all hockey.
A good transition play can
sometimes involve every play-
er on the ice, and Michigan's
recent success scoring in tran-
sition speaks about the team's
turnaround and its ability to
come together as a whole.

The Michigan women's basket-
ball team won't admit it's looking
ahead in the NCAA Tournament,
but it's hard to resist taking a peek
at the bracket's possibilities.
The Wolverines received an
eight seed in this year's tourna-
ment in their first back-to-back
appearances in the postseason
since the 2000-01 seasons. The
historical 2000-01 seasons also
marked the last time Michigan
garnered an eight seed, which is
the program's best-ever seed.
Michigan faces the nine seed
in the Spokane Region, Villanova,
in the first round of the tourna-
ment. The Wolverines, who have
been hardened by a competi-
tive Big Ten season, are looking
to advance past the first round,
where, they were bounced last
year by Oklahoma.
"We have more experience,
we've been to the NCAA Tour-
nament, we've been dancing
and I think this year we will be
more prepared and hopefully get
a win," said senior guard Kate
Thompson.
The Wolverines will have two
more days to prepare for the
Wildcats before their matchup
Saturday evening in Palo Alto,
Calif. There isn't a doubt that
first-year Michigan coach Kim
Barnes Arico has been installing
a game plan to outwit Villanova,
a team she faced numerous times
during her tenure at St. John's.

Jacob Cronenworth leads
surging 'M' baseball team

Superstitious
freshman has
impressed early
 with bat and arm
By JEREMY SUMMITT
Daily Sports Writer
He doesn't call them supersti-
tions, he calls them routines.
Every game, Michigan base-
ball freshman Jacob Cronen-
worth does a few things the
same way. He places his bag in
the same spot in the dugout and
puts his uniform on in a particu-
lar order.
But it doesn't matter what he
calls it. All that matters is that
it's certainly working for him.
Cronenworth, a two-way
player as a second baseman and
a right-handed pitcher, is leading
the Wolverines both offensively
and defensively in his first sea-
son. He has knocked in a team-
high 17 RBI in 18 games, and he
has posted a stellar 2.14 ERA in
8.1 innings of work as a reliever.
His best outing of the season
came on March 10 against Holy
Cross when he pitched the final
three scoreless innings en route
to his third save of the season.
Not even Michigan coach Erik

Bakich could've predicted the
tremendous start Cronenworth
has built thus far.
"I don't think you ever expect
a freshman to step in there and
perform at a high level right
away," Bakich said. "There's
usually an adjustment period,
but he's done a great job of really
focusing on having quality at-
bats and making quality pitch-
es."
Even though Michigan hasn't
hit many home runs collective-
ly, Cronenworth still leads that
offensive category with two on
the year. Cronenworth said that
as a kid, he used to like hitting
more than pitching, but it has
balanced out since he arrived at
Michigan.
Rightly so. His arm has served
him just as well as his bat lately.
Remaining focused on both sides
of the ball tends to be a challenge
that Cronenworth has stepped
right up to as a budding play-
maker for Michigan's young ros-
ter.
"Usually when I'm in the
field or at the plate, I'm focused
on hitting," Cronenworth said.
"And then, whenever I have to
go in at the seventh, eight or
ninth inning, whenever that
time comes that I'm warming up
in the bullpen, my mind kind of
switches where I'm all pitching."

Withthat philosophy, Cronen-
worth makes it seem pretty
simple to stay alert offensively
and defensively, but under his
humble attitude is a work ethic
that never stops operating. He
made a pledge to Bakich to beef
up before the season began, and
a significant weight gain was just
a glimpse of what Cronenworth
had in store for the upcoming
season.
"He's one of those guys that
is always working on his game
outside of practice hours on his
own, whether it be in the hitting
cages, or whatever," Bakich said.
"He's invested a lot of time into
his improvement, and results are
showing now. It's a testament to
his hard work."
All his pre- and in-season
motivation, and quite possibly
those routines, have propelled
Michigan to some recent suc-
cess. The Wolverines are 6-4 in
their past 10 games, which is a
significant improvement from
getting swept by California on
opening weekend just a month
ago.
Alongside already proven
stars like senior center fielder
Patrick Biondi and junior right
fielder Michael O'Neill, Cronen-
worth continues to provide that
extra boost Michigan has been
hoping for.

Redshirt junior Jake Ryan will almost certainly miss part of the 2013 season with a torn ACL suffered in practice Tuesday.

Redshirt junior linebacker
Jake Ryan sustained a torn ante-
rior cruciate ligament in practice
Tuesday, the Michigan football
team announced Wednesday.
Ryan is out indefinitely, and based
on standard recovery times for
the injury, it is likely he will miss
part, if not all, of the 2013 season.
Ryan emerged as Michigan's
leading tackler and its most
dynamic difference maker in
2012. He recorded 88 tackles,
including16 for loss, 4.5 sacks and
four forced fumbles - all tops on
the team. He was named to the
All-Big Ten second team by the
media.
"You always hate when anyone
gets injured, and unfortunately
we've dealt with our share of inju-
ries in the last 12 months," said
Michigan coach Brady Hoke in a
statement. "We will support Jake
to make sure he has everything he
needs to get through this. I know
he will attack his rehabilitation
just like he does everything else

and will be back when he's ready."
The competition for strong-
side linebacker will likely be
between fifth-year senior Cam-
eron Gordon - who impressed
in winter workouts, according to
Hoke - and sophomore lineback-
er Joe Bolden, who typically plays
on the weak side.
Recovery time for an ACL tear
typically takes a year, though that
time varies by person. Adrian
Peterson, running back for the

Minnesota Vikings, tore his ACL
on Dec. 24, 2011 but was able to
return for the start of the 2012
NFL season.

freshman year and cannot be

This was without a doubt one of the films that has made me laugh the
most in my life. This was my first time seeing "Dumb and Dumber" in its
entirety. And when Harold and Lloyd popped my cherry for this film, ohboy
did they do it with exuberance and hilarity.
There were an incredible amountcof quotable moments, and asa frequent
movie-quoter, I appreciated that - I just wish I could remember more of
them. Hmm, what stuck out most?
"My parakeet Petey, he's dead." "What happened?" "His head fell off."
"His head fell off?" "Yeah, he was pretty old." That scene spoke to me - and
not just because my pet parakeet had his head fall off when I was a child -
but because it was hilarious while touching on real-world issues, like spon-
taneous decapitation of house pets.
And Harry's ski date set a new standard for romance in my eyes. If you're
a girl and enjoy being tackled into the snow and whitewashed, then we're
goingto have an incredible time together (will you marry me?).
I had a great time at this screening (and not just because I got to go on a
date with Akshay). Gettingbaked and watching this is something everyone
who loves to laugh should experience - and really, if you don't love to laugh,

I will never be drunk enough for Jim Carrey. I expected "Dumb and

dumb. I'm at home now and I'm racking my brains for some redeeming
quality that separated "Dumb and Dumber" from the cartoon drivel that
pollutes pop comedy, and I can think of nada. Bathroom humor, awkward
sexual advances and crass objectification, worship of material wealth, guns
as comic props, animal cruelty, slapstick skits and a passionate commitment
to nonsense. This movie is the caviar of low-brow, gross-out bullshit.
I'm not saying I didn't giggle once or thrice, but there was shame and
embarrassment. No level of alcohol poisoning could make this guilty plea-
sure of a movie actually pleasurable. I'm sorry to hang a classic out to dry
like this, but I cannot vouch. But I met a few guys who would!
The three gentlemen in front of me in the theater were aboutcon my level,
trunk-wise, and they were loving every minute. David Golightly, Brian
Thorpe and Jason Albosta. All three of them knew every word of the movie
by heart and they weren't too shy to prove it. They were so fantastically
invested that I grabbed ahold of them after the showing; they were ecstatic
aboutcendorsing it. They called me a "Dumb and Dumber"-virgin for having
never seen it before, and insisted that I quote them. They even wrote their
names downfor me on a coupon.
David Golightly said, "I have spent over 400 dollars renting this movie
before I bought it." He went on to saythat he owns it in both VHS and DVD.
Brian Thorpe called the film "The Best Ever!" (he insisted that I under-
line the "ever") and Jason Albosta proudly declared, "I quote this movie
on a daily basis." Golightly hastened to note that they were all successfully
employed college graduates around the age of 30. They were dressed well
enough that I believed them. Albosta was wearing a State cap.
So, there are apparently good people who like this movie. But God help
them, because I have no idea what I just watched. It was, in all seriousness,
a measure too dumb to qualify as entertainment.
-NOAH COHEN
There's no getting around it: "Dumb and Dumber" is dumb. The jokes
are easy, slapstick is glorified and everything is objectified. But does that
mean it's a bad movie? Of course not.
The crucial difference between mistaking this classic for any run-of-
the-mill idiot comedy is who you go see it with. If it's with people who've
seen the movie literally 10 or more times before, to the point where they
can quote random lines in varying states of intoxication, you're going to
have a great time. If you go with an angry drunk who doesn't appreciate
Jim Carrey's comedic genius, you won't.
Even though I was completely sober in my recent 12th viewing of the
film, I had the good fortune of sitting behind a group of three extremely
inebriated individuals who screamed lines word for word at the screen
and laughed raucously every time Carrey opened his mouth. There was
also a pretty stoned dude sitting next to me who'seemed to be getting a
kick out of the film, but he looked distant, laughing quietly at random
moments with a dazed look in his eyes. These four were enlightened.
They saw that the key to having a worthwhile time is accepting the film
to be the epitome of stupidity and findingthe little kid in your heart who
wants nothing more than to revel in embracing that idiocy.

'Shenandoah'
tac les inequality

Documentarian
discusses racial
issues in new film
By SEAN CZARNECKI
Daily Film Editor
In 2008, an undocumented
immigrant named Luis Ramirez
was beaten to death by four
white, star football players in
* Shenandoah, Penn. - a trag-
edy now immortalized by the
upcoming documentary that
shares its name with the town.
Scheduled to show at the
Michigan Theater on March 27,
"Shenandoah" is as much a doc-
umentary about the victim as it
is about the coal-mining town
itself. And for five years, Pulit-
zer Prize-winning photographer
and filmmaker David Turnley,
and Art & Design professor,
labored to capture this painful
moment, this volatile re-imagin-
ing of Americanism - what the
film's tagline calls "The Ameri-
can Dream on Trial"
Turnley was sure to tread his
words carefully. Several times,
he started, stopped, double-
backed and skipped forward just
to recount this American story
with the same precision and
respect displayed in the crafts-
manship of the film itself.
"The challenges of working-
class communities and where
we stand as a nation today in real
terms with regard to our values
as an immigrant nation," Turn-
ley said, "are all seriously impor-
tant questions and realities to
where we are as a country."
Both Turnley and his twin
brother Peter grew up in Fort
Wayne, Ind. - a very segregated
city at the time - with an ideal-
istic spirit instilled into them by
historical figures such as Martin
Luther King Jr. and President
John F. Kennedy.
After sustaining a football
injury, Peter went into the inner
city of Fort Wayne to photo-
graph the lives of people there.
"When I started looking at
these photographs, it was then
I realized what is equal, what is
human dignity," Turnley said.
"And when I discovered photog-
raphy, it gave me an opportunity
to use the camera to do those
things, to actively seek to engage
with the world we live in and all
kinds of different people."
I picked up a camera and sort
of never looked back."
Turnley went on to work at
the Detroit Free Press for 18
years, where he covered Apart-
heid South Africa for three
years. He worked in Europe and
all over the world until finally
comingback to the United States
from 1996 to 1997 to study film-
making at Harvard.
"I wanted to live in a world
that wasn't divided, in a world
that was ... " Turnley trailed off,
thought to himself a moment
and continued, "I thought life
sort of meant the world we live
(in) is meant to be celebrated
and explored. And I wanted to
be part of that big world."
In 2008, then-Illinois Sena-
tor Barack Obama campaigned
for the American presidency
under the slogan, "Yes, we can!,"

which originated from Latino
American civil rights activist
Cesar Chavez. Inspired by what
he viewed as the inclusive vision
long aspired toward by the lead-
ers he grew up with, Turnley
worked with the presidential
hopeful as the campaign pho-
tographer for several days.
"And then at some point in the
spring of 2008, President-elect
Obama, at a fundraiser, made a
statement that in times of cri-
sis, the working class across the
Rust Belt clings to their guns
and religion," Turley said. "And
it made me think, once again,
here we go: His vision is an
inclusive America, but in fact,
there appear to be many Ameri-
cas."
At this, Turnley, who was
briefly a walk-on for the Uni-
versity football team, was com-
pelled to make a film about the
working class in a place of peo-
ple about whom his father and
grandfather spoke, where they
play tough football.
