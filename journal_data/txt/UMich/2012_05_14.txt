SHADOWS
From Page 10
intertwining stories and dra-
matic intensity, and yet it fails to dig
deep into any of these character-
istics, choosing to embrace super-
ficial entertainment instead. It's
funny, but there's only enough com-
edy to make it bearable to watch.
It's also far from dramatic. The
dysfunctional family is exact-
ly that - dysfunctional. And if
you're expecting an "Edward
Scissorhands"-esque romantic
tale, think again. All of the family's
problems are blamed, quite sim-
ply, on Angelique and her curse. In
terms of undertaking such a large
responsibility for all the woes of the
Collins family, Green's Angelique is
stunningly evil. There's not a man
on the planet who can steal Depp's
thunder in a movie almost custom-
made for him, but Green proves that
there certainly is a woman. While
Depp seems strangely detached to

his character, Green is fully devoted
to making Angelique the most evil
witch since the Wicked Witch of
the West.
Sadly, the script fails to give the
supporting characters much to
work with. Pfeiffer, Moretz and
Bonham Carter are left with a few
humorous scenes with Depp that
mainly derive from Barnabas's
inability to adapt to the new cen-
tury and its oddities like fast food,
cars and female doctors. The film
goes no deeper into the struggles of
its characters.
"Dark Shadows" is an honest
effort. It's mildly funny, some-
what entertaining and, like every
Burton film, beautiful to watch.
In the hands of any other director,
it would score solidly. But with
Burton and Depp at the helm,
mediocrity of this kind is sim-
ply unacceptable. If anything, it
proves once again that Hollywood
just can't seem to get its vampire
formula right.

PBS
From Page 10
still. Is that our only excuse? Piti-
ful.
As for the BBC, it operates under
an annual television license fee,
which allows the station to acquire
revenue from every citizen who
owns a television, and thus pro-
duce kick-ass programming. The
very existence of PBS is thrown
into question here in the U.S. with
alarming frequency; the worry
being that PBS has outlived its
necessity for servicing the public
good.
Why don't we care about our
public broadcasting? Maybe it's an
oversimplification, but in every way
you look at it, we are losing to Brit-
ain. I'd hazard a guess that while
I'm contentedly watching "Sher-
lock," not a lot of British people are
hunkering down with their Earl
Grey, ready to catch the latest grip-
ping hour of "American Masters."

Yet what PBS offers, limited
though it may be, can't be swept
away so easily. The station airs a,
large amount of educational pro-
gramming for children and several
news outlets, such as "Frontline."
Why do these matter, you ask? PBS,
not being controlled by advertisers
or commercial interests, doesn't
necessarily have to uphold said
interests of commercial entities.
Meaning when tuning into PBS, you
can reasonably expect a higher level
of impartiality than with a station
operating under corporate owner-
ship.
Not to mention the fact that one
of PBS's main goals is to offer con-
tent that wouldn't be shown oth-
erwise. Including programs that
focus on the local community or
fine arts, which have been sorely
neglected on regular broadcast sta-
tions as they don't pull big numbers,
viewership-wise.
Even though we've established
that public broadcasting is a useful,

and in fact necessary, public entity,
the fact remains: nobody cares
about PBS. It's something your
grandparents watch while they're
playing bridge. But it doesn't have
to be that way.
The U.S. should follow the excel-
lent example set by Britain and the
BBC and develop an adequate sys-
tem of funding public broadcasting.
Now, don't freak out. I'm not say-
ing we have to develop an annual
television license fee, though such
a system obviously works pretty
well, considering the level of quality
coming out of the BBC.
All I'm suggesting, is that we,
as a country, should think more
about our public broadcasting.
A program that was developed
in the interest of the pubic good
shouldn't be an afterthought in
our society. It's time for PBS to
become the channel to watch.
OK, that might be stretching it,
but everybody's got to have a goal,
right?

UHS to be
appointment only,
electronic records
By JACOB AXELRAD
Editor in Chief
Starting today, University
Health Services is implementing
changes including the discontinu-
ation of walk-in appointments.
Students seeking medical care on
campus will have to schedule an
appointment prior to when they
need to be seen.
UHS Director Robert Win-
field said in an interview with The
Michigan Daily that UHS decided
to eliminate walk-in appointments
after assessing results of extensive
surveys sent to patients over the
past four years in order to make
UHS more efficient.
The removal of walk-in treat-
ment is one of two major changes -
the otherwillbe UHS's switch from
paper to electronic health records,
according to Winfield. While the
entire University medical center
will be making the switch to elec-
tronic records in mid-August, UHS
was selected as one of three pilot
sites to go live on June 13.
Winfield said patients will be

able to use what's known as a
"patient portal" in order to access
their medical records online with a
personal sign-in code.
"The patient portal will be
designed so that I could send you
an e-mail and say, 'Your lab test
results are available on the patient
portal,"' Winfield said. "Then you,
having a code which we've set up
for you at the time that you were
seen, would go to the patient por-
tal, sign in using your sign-on and
get your results and what I thought
about them."
Winfield addedthat thoughUHS
has conducted patient satisfaction
surveys since the 1980s, it wasn't
until four years ago that surveys
were expanded.to include catego-
ries such as the waiting experience
for patients, the cleanliness of the
building and topics like diversity
and privacy.
Winfield said UHS has respond-
ed to many complaints voiced by
patients regarding the clinic's facil-
ities, but added the issue they've
been unable to address is the walk-
in waiting experience.
"We were frustrated because we
were having trouble getting satis-
faction with our walk-in service
above 85 percent among the stu-
dents," he said.

day began a three-day, national
conference about Title IX hosted

Burton's latest fails
to captivate audience
despite star cast
By: ADITI MISHRA
DailyArts Writer-
"Dark Shadows" is the film adap-
tation of a '66-71 TV series of the
same name, but to call it a mere
adaptation would
be a grave mis-
take. Few clas-
sic tales, be they Dark
works of fiction Shadows
or television, have
lived to retain the At Quality16
same legacy after and Rave
director Tim
Burton ("Alice
in Wonderland")
has given them his edition of an
" extreme makeover. "Dark Shad-
ows" seems to be the latest in line
to have fallen prey to the maestro's
vivid, eccentric imagination and
come out truly and thoroughly
"Burtonfied."
While this film once again dis-
plays the director's trademark flare

for the bold and the colorful, there's
nothing groundbreaking about it
other than the fact that it's a qua-
si-mockery of Hollywood's recent'
obsession with vampires and were-
wolves.
"Dark Shadows" tells the story
of Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp,
"Rango"), a wealthy man who's
turned into a vampire by the evil
witch Angelique (Eva Green, "Per-
fect Sense") after failing to recipro-
cate her love. Barnabas is freed from
his coffin after 200 years, only to
find himself thrust into a vastly dif-
ferent time and a society he doesn't
understand. His family home is inM
ruins, and his descendants are more
dysfunctional than he is.
The current Collins fam-
ily is headed by Elizabeth Collins
(Michelle Pfeiffer, "New Year's-
Eve") who resides with her brother

City officials
discuss Huron
River Trail system &
construction
By STEVE ZOSKI
Daily News Editor
The Northside Grill usually
serves as one of Ann Arbor's
breakfast restaurants, but last
night served as a meeting place
where Ann Arbor residents sat
down for coffee and discussion
with city officials.
Ann Arbor resident and North-
side Grill owner Jim Koli said he
has hosted community events at
his business since he took it over
in 1993. Sabra Briere (D-Ward
1) said she and Sandi Smith (D-

Ward 1) have held annual town
halls at the restaurant since they
were elected in 2007 and 2008,
respectively.
Briere and Smith joined Ann
Arbor Mayor John Hieftje and
City Administrator Steven Pow-
ers to respond to questions and
city concerns voiced by residents
at the town hall.
Hieftje said he hopes the Riv-
erUp! Wolfpack - an organiza-
tion that intends to improve the
Huron River, comprised of 75
leaders including John Dingell
(D-Mich)- as well as the Nation-
al Wildlife Federation's local
branch and the Michigan League
of Conservation Voters will help
fund a Huron River Trail system.
"If we can get the link between
the greenway proposedarea at 721
and cross under through the rail-
road tracks, some way over there

to the border, that's going to open
up some other funding mecha-
nisms and eventually the border
should go all the way to Dexter,
all the way east, and hook up with
other trail systems," Hieftje said.
Though Hieftje added that
funding opportunities are not as
abundant as they used to be.
"I think the thing to remem-
ber is, had we been at this stage
in 1995, we could get all this stuff
funded - but we've just been
through the worst decade of
funding," Hieftje said.
Koli said the neighborhood
should develop residential hous-
ing.
"It doesn't want (Zaragon) or
stuff like that, 10 story student
housing, it doesn't want stuff like
that either, I understand they're
closing down Baits but we're not
going to make up for it here," Koli
said. "I would personally have
more owner occupied (units) than
rental units."
Koli said the University's rela-
tionship with the city needs to
better reflect the needs of Ann
Arbor residents.

"It's a great thing, but there's
a struggle to find a balance," Koli
said.
And Briere said the neigh-
borhood has preferences about
potential growth.
"There's lots of opportunity,
the neighborhood doesn't want
high-rises, it doesn't want office
buildings, it will probably fight if
somebody proposes those things.
" Briere said.
Briere said the University has
frustrated residents in areas
where it plans to create new hous-
ing for hospital workers.
"The University isn't respon-
sible, it's not going to say, 'Yeah I
see you've got a plan, we're going
to follow your plan.' It's going to
say, 'Well we've got a plan and
we're going to follow our plan,' "
she said.
Briere said if there was a legal
way to stop the University, she
would do it.
"They want the University to
actually respect the city, to actu-
ally respect the rights of the peo-
ple who already live here," Briere
said.

Marriage equality
President Obama's comments reflect changing views
History was made Wed. May 9, 2012 when President Barack
Obama became the first U.S. president to publicly support
same-sex marriage, sparking the conversation about the
legalization of same-sex marriage once again. Obama's comments indi-
cated that he believes all U.S. states should legalize same-sex marriage.
While some states have taken the initiative and given same-sex cou-
ples the right to marry, Michigan, unfortunately, has not. In light of
Obama's monumental announcement, Michigan should take steps to
make his message a reality and legalize same-sex marriage.

Twenty-five strangers, dropped
off in a foreign country, forced to
live together in one hotel for five
weeks as they
acclimate to
the language,
the culture
and each other.
Sounds like
something
you'd watch on
MTV, right?
Well, in this
version of "The CAITLIN
Real World" MORATH
I'm contestant
number one.
And there's one
major twist: I'm earning seven col-
lege credits.
In just a few days I will depart
for my study abroad program
in Rome. I'll spend the next five
weeks studying social science and
immersing myself in history and
red wine. Despite having an Ital-
ian best friend and an undying love
of pasta, my knowledge of Italian
language and culture is limitedto
"The Godfather," and whatever
Giada De Laurentiis tells me. I'm
culturally aware that mobsters
and food don't even begin to cover
the essence of Italy. But as for
everything else, I'm in for a sur-
prise. (Okay, I take it back. Maybe
I'm hoping that food really does
account for half of Italian culture.)
The first half of each week is
scheduled with class, but the rest
is left for traveling either alone or
with classmates I have yet to meet.
Sorrento, Florence, Berlin; get
ready, here we come. For better or
worse, I'm set to travel Europe the
only way I know how, with a group
of strangers. And, quite frankly, I
think that's the best way to go.
Some find comfort in traveling
in the company of friends or fam-
ily, but I prefer my companions to
be as new as the surroundings I'm
discovering.
The first time I traveled abroad
was with the student-ambassador
group, People to People. The pro-
gram combined high school stu-
dents from all over Michigan into
one group, and then sent us away
for three weeks to tour England
and France. I'd never been the type
of kid to go away to camp, so the
idea of spending three weeks over-
seas with complete strangers terri-
fied me, even as a teenager.
I quickly realized that the ano-
nymity between my cohorts and I

was a blessing of sorts. We had no
shared history and could reason-
ably assume that we wouldn't be
seeing much of each other after
the trip was over, so there was no
pretense to act like anything other
than myself. It wasn't as if the
group lacked camaraderie. In fact,
we all seemed to fall into an easy
friendship. The distinct difference
between traveling with loved ones
and traveling with near strangers
is that I had the freedom to pursue
my own interests.
Anonymity is
a blessing for
studying abroad.
I rarely stayed with just one
group of friends throughout the
day; instead, I preferred to jump
from clique to clique. Not being
tethered to just one or two com-
panions gave me the freedom to
interact with all sorts of people,
and to let their personalities and
interests color my own experience.
I toured the Louvre with an art
teacher, saw the beaches of Nor-
mandy with a veteran's grand-
daughter, practiced ballet with
dance students on the Englishwsea
shore and even broke away from
the group entirely in Gravesend to
shop with some local schoolgirls.
I wouldn't have had the opportu-
nity to jump as easily from group to
group if I had been tied to a select
few from home.
My high-school experience
proved that heading into travel
groups without a companion is the
most rewarding and free way to go.
And hey, this is college, right? So
why not up the ante? Make it five
weeks instead of three, and toss ina
language barrier for good measure.
I'm even studying abroad through
another university, so there's really
no chance I'll get to know my class-
mates before we board the flight
to Rome. Things are about to get
Real (okay, so maybe Ishould come
to terms with the fact that I'm not
actually going to be on an MTV
show).

Blue advances to
Sweet 16 again

By BEN SEIDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
Texas A&M took the Michi-
gan women's tennis team to the
brink, bending but not breaking at
the Varsity Tennis Center in Ann
Arbor this weekend.
With the dual score tied at
three, the only athletes left on the
courts were Michigan sophomore
Brooke Bolender and Aggie Naz-
ari Urbina. In order for Michigan
win a third consecutive bid to the
NCAA Sweet 16, Bolender would
have to dig deep in the third set to
pull out a victory against her stiff
competition.
And Bolender did just that. Only
two weeks ago, Bolender was put
in an identical situation but failed,
as Michigan lost, 4-3, to Purdue on
April 29.
"Unfortunately I had one of
those two weeks ago," Bolender
said. "I've accepted that it's going
to be me. Basically, I have been in
that situation. It's kind of a rare
situation and regardless of wheth-
er I have won or lost in the past, I
know what it feels like."
Bolender credited junior Mimi
Nguyen for staying on the courts
as long as she could, but when
Nguyen couldn't hold off any lon-
ger, Bolender stepped up for the
team.
The crowd was crucial in push-
ing Bolender to fight through any
doubts she may have had as she
helped claw her team back to vic-
tory.
"We had an awesome crowd
here today," Bolender said. "It was
a very intense dual match. It was a
little nerve-racking but fortunate-
ly we worked hard enough to pull
it off."
Bernstein was both relieved
and excited. She was relieved
for Bolender to come through in
another tough spot and also excit-
ed to make it to the Sweet 16 for
the third year in a row.
"We've had a few disappoint-
ments this year, which I think is
a sign of being young, but it was
huge for everyone to step up today
after losing a tough doubles point,"
Bernstein said. "We were a little
deflated and I got on them and

they stepped up to take four sin-
gles points."
Being at home was huge for Ber-
nstein and the team. At this point
of the season, the team was not
ready to give up.
"I'm looking at the scoreboard
and I'm like, we got to turn one
of these around," Bernstein said.
"The way they competed, I'm
proud of the girls and I'm happy
for them. It helps being at home
and having fighters. We just didn't
want our season to end.
"I'm so happy for (Brooke). I
was standing there and thinking
to myself, 'You want to win for the
team, but I just wanted her to win,
more just because I didn't want her
to have to go through the feeling
that she had against Purdue."'
The team circled Bolender to
celebrate the victory on home turf.
"You've got to stay on the court
as long as you can," said Bern-
stein. "We've had different people
stepping up. That's what a team
is. That's what is so special about
college tennis. It is an individual
sport but in the college format, it's
a team and you need everybody."
The only senior on the team,
Michelle Sulahian, defeated her
opponent, Janine Erasmus, win-
ning 12 of her 16 games played Sat-
urday.
"Texas A&M gave us a run for
our money today," Sulahian said.
"They're a good team. Every week-
end we're fighting and everyone's
starting to play together as ateam.
We can hang with anybody really."
Michigan men't basketball
coach John Beilein was in atten-
dance Saturday for the final
matches after watching the soft-
ball team finish a sweep of Purdue.
"It was a great atmosphere here
with the way it unfolded," Beilein
said. "The drama was incredible so
I am really happy for (Michigan)
coach (Ronni) Bernstein and the
team because they had to go' all
the way to win this one. There is a
great appreciation on this campus
with the high-level athletes that
are on the other teams and not just
your own."
Next week, Michigan will face
off against a tough Florida team,
ranked number two in the nation.

On Wednesday, Obama went
on national television for an
interview with Robin Roberts on
ABC. He stated that his views on
same-sex marriage have evolved
throughout his term as president.
While originally in support of
equal benefits for same-sex part-
ners through civil unions, Obama
announced that his stance on the
issue has changed and he now
believes same-sex couples should
have the right to marry. This
statement came a day after North
Carolina banned gay marriage in
their constitution, showing the
rapidly-changing yet still-divided
national stance on the issue.
Obama's comments represent
the changing political climate of
our country. In the past 10 years,
Americans' views on same-sex
marriage have changed quickly as
the acceptance of same-sex mar-
riage increases. Pew Research

Center found that among regis-
tered voters, support for same-
sex marriage has grown from 35
percent in 2001 to 47 percent this
year. While some states, such as
North Carolina, have banned
same-sex marriage in their con-
stitution, there is an overall trend
toward support of same-sex
marriage among Democrats and
Republicans.
Michigan needs to take the
initiative and legalize same-sex
marriage. In telephone inter-
views with 600 likely Michigan
voters, 44 percent said they sup-
port same-sex marriage com-
pared to the 43 percent that
oppose it. Our state has advocat-
ed gay rights for years, with Ann
Arbor being the first city in the
U.S. to pass a gay rights ordinance
in 1972 and then electing the first
Openly gay city-council member
in 1974. We should continue this

history of acceptance and support
of gay rights by legalizing same-
sex marriage, thereby setting a
precedent for other states to fol-
low.
The legalization of same-
sex marriage is not a partisan
issue, nor is it a "liberal" policy
that most of the U.S. is strongly
against. Same-sex marriage is
supported by people of all dif-
ferent ages, political parties and
backgrounds. If Michigan wants
to look back with pride on its
support of same-sex marriage, it
should take steps to allow these
couples to marry. Obama has
made it clear that if the president
of the United States is allowed
to come out in support of gay
marriage, the people of the U.S.
should rally behind him and push
for the legalization of this basic
human right:.

"We had a tough time as a team

junior center-fielder Patrick Bion-
di. "We were a little bit impatient
all weekend. ... We didn't hit at all
and we understand that we didn't
play a good game of baseball in
any part of the game."
Posting 14 runs on 17 hits
against Michigan's four-man
bullpen effort, the Boilermakers
rewrote history books with their
first title since 1909.
The Wolverines fell apart on
the mound after the first score-
less inning gave a glimpse of hope.
Through the next seven frames,
Purdue did damage at the plate
and took advantage of11 walks.
The hurlers - sophomore right-
hander Alex Lakatos, freshman
left-hander Trent Szkutnik, senior
right-hander Kevin Vangheluwe
and freshman right-hander James
Bourque - gave up runs early and
often, making it impossible for
Michigan to bounce back.
Boilermaker right-hander
Lance Breedlove pitched seven
innings, allowing only one hit and
leaving the Wolverines with zeros
across the board. But with enough
insurance, Purdue sent the inex-
perienced right-hander Andrew
Quinnette into relief.
Quinnette, with a 9.00 ERA in
just three innings of work this
season, gave Michigan its three
runs. Winger opened up the

pitch, and senior catcher Coley
Crank smacked one into the left-
field net, driving in the first two
runs.
But that was not nearly enough
to stymie the Boilermakers before
they claimed the crown.
"It sucked," said junior right-
hander Ben Ballantine. "That's
what we dream - that's why we
all came to Michigan. ... That's
where we aspire to be. Next year,
without a doubt, that's what we're
coming for."
On Sunday, a different color
flooded the field at the end of the
narrow 4-3 matchup.
After Purdue scored the first
run in the second frame, the Wol-
verines logged its first lead of the
weekend on Biondi's solo home
run and Crank's RBI single.
Michigan tacked on another
pair of runs in the fourth inning,

which was just enough for Ballan-
tine to work with from the mound.
On a solid defensive delivery
from Ballantine and redshirt
junior left-hander Bobby Brosna-
han, the Boilermakers suffered a
close loss, 4-3, and the Wolverines
avoided the sweep. With the win,
Michigan prevented Purdue from
taking sole possession of the Big
Ten title. The Boilermakers cur-
rently hold a three-game lead over
Penn State and will have to win at
least one game next weekend to
be the lone winners of the title, on
the caveat that the Nittany Lions
win all three games.
"It was a big win - the kids bat-
tled back," Maloney said. "I don't
think it's ever easy when you see
someone getting what you want.
On the flip side of it is you gotta
win with class, you gotta lose with
class."

Imagine that you're sitting at
home and your children are thirsty.
You go to get a glass of water for
them, but realize you can't because
the water from the faucet has been
heavily polluted with high levels
of nitrates due to increased use of
fertilizers and hydraulic fracking.
This scenario could become a real-
ity in the near future.
Perhaps you've seen videos on
YouTube in which people are able
to light their tap water on fire. It's
difficult to imagine that these prob-
lems could be happening in the U.S,
but water is becoming more pollut-
ed with each passing day.
Water containing high levels of
nitrates has led to an increase in
Blue baby syndrome. When infants
drink this polluted water, they
experience shortness of breath and
their skin turns blue as the nitrates
in the water deprive the baby's
blood of oxygen.
Blue baby syndrome has
occurred in cities throughout the
U.S., notably in Iowa. Despite the
fact that there have been mod-
est improvements in our infra-
structure and the Environmental
Protection Agency's standards,
Blue baby syndrome continues
to haunt many American fami-
lies. Such health-related problems
have occurred for the past sev-
eral decades, but we still have not
found a way to resolve these issues.
In fact, as recently as 2011, Iowa's
Department of Natural Resources
reported high levels of nitrates
in tap water, according to the Des
Moines Register.
Even more disturbing, though
therenhaverbeen improvements
in environmental standards and
infrastructure, the quality of that
infrastructure has not improved.
According to the American Society
of Civil Engineers, the U.S. earned
a "D" grade for its water quality
in 2009. Each year, America faces
an annual shortfall of at least $20
billion to maintain its water infra-
structure. This number has been
increasing for the past several

years, and if we are not careful, it
will continue to rise with time.
Water quality is only the tip of
the iceberg for our country's crum-
bling infrastructure. Due to the
lack of global competition, Ameri-
cans have fallen into a state of
complacency, thinking that repair-
ing water systems and bridges
isn't important because the U.S. is
already successful and influential.
Moreover, many Americans have
simply accepted the fact that our
infrastructure is falling apart. As
a result, the costs of our crumbling
infrastructure has been increas-
ing. The American Society of Civil
Engineers reported in 2009 that a
$2.2 trillion investment over five
years needed tobe made to improve
American infrastructure, which
was an increase from $1.6 trillion
in 2005. If we wait any longer,
those costs will continue to rise.
Action won't be taken unless
our governmentplaces value on
water or any other area of infra-
structure, for that matter. Our gov-
ernment hasn't paid attention to
water because it has been viewed
as a renewable resource. But water
is a limited resource that must
be looked after carefully. Many
Americans have sat by idly while
our water supply has become pol-
luted. Waiting around is no longer
an option, as the amount of avail-
able fresh water is running out.
We must take care of this resource
before it's too late.
If we don't act now America will
likely suffer greatly in the future.
We can no longer afford to rely on
future generations to fix our infra-
structure. It is time that we spend
the appropriate amount of money
to resolve these deficiencies. If
we continue to do nothing, future
generations may be susceptible to
Blue baby syndrome, just a small
example of the many problems
that will likely arise from crum-
bling infrastructure.

Same-sex marriage and wom-
en's rights are two social issues
that seem to
be popping up
in the media
everywhere
these days.
Whether it's
Obama's pub-
lic support of
same-sex mar-
riage or Rush SARAH
Limbaugh's SKALUBA
absurd "slut"
comment,
the constant
attention these issues are given
shows just how important they are
to the American people.
The social issues prevalent in
our country elicit strong individ-
ual opinions, which in turn widen
the gap between Democrats and
Republicans. As Democrats reach
out to earn the support of same-
sex couples and young voters, it
seems Republicans are silently
sitting aside and not attempting
to go after these demographics.
The individual comments made
by extreme conservatives aren't
representative of the entire party
as a whole, but instead the ideas
of a small, ultra-conservative
minority.
As University of Michigan stu-
dents living in one of the more
liberal cities in America, we find
ourselves in a diverse commu-
nity that encourages individual-
ity and independence. So it should
come as no surprise to us that
the majority of college students
are becoming increasingly lib-
eral, especially when it comes to
social issues like same-sex mar-
riage. But as society progresses,
the Republican Party has fallen
victim to the ever-growing num-
ber of outrageous claims made
by conservative radio show hosts

In this case, it would've been helpful for him to explain to Malia and Sasha that
while her friends' parents are no doubt lovely people, that's not a reason to
change thousands of years of thinking about marriage:'
- Daughter of former Alaskan governor, Bristol Palm, writing about President Obama's policy change in
her official blog.
Conservative quandry

and certain Republican leaders.
It's this small group of super-
conservative individuals that
damages the Republican Party's
reputation. As more and more
Americans are accepting the
ideas of same-sex marriage and
women's right to contraception,
conservatives are isolating certain
groups and losing support.
This past February conserva-
tive talk show host Rush Lim-
baugh verbally attacked Sandra
Fluke, a third-year law student at
Georgetown University, after the
testimony she gave about mandat-
ing contraceptive insurance at her
school. On his show Limbaugh
said, "It makes her a slut, right? It
makes her a prostitute. She wants
to be paid to have sex. She's hav-
ing so much sex she can't afford
the contraception." And yes, this
is indeed a real talk show that has
aired on more than 600 stations
across the nation and boasts "mil-
lions" of listeners every day.
Limbaugh's remarks were not
only extremely offensive and irra-
tional, but also serve as a prime
example as to why the Republican
Party is losing support. I'm not an
expert, but I can't imagine how
calling a young, educated woman a
prostitute and slut for standing up
for her liberties is a reliable or pos-
itive tactic, especially in the eyes
of women. When such prominent
individuals like Limbaugh make
these outrageous public claims,
it's hard not to assume that the
entire Republican Party is a bunch
of crazy, conservative lunatics.
Sadly, the absurd remarks made
by a few people do have the abil-
ity to taint an entire group's image
and create a nasty stigma for
everyone involved. Former GOP
candidate Rick Santorum only
strengthened this stigma after
saying that he opposes abortionin

all situations during a CNN inter-
view. According to Santorum, "we
must make the best of a bad situ-
ation," even if that involves rape.
His conservative stance on abor-
tion is a reflection of his Catholic
faith and not that of the entire
Republican Party. All too often,
however, these individual opin-
ions become representative of the
party as a whole when they are
actually just the sole attitude of
one person.
Republicans
must review
their attitudes
As our country evolves and
moves forward, it's important for
Republican leaders to realize the
huge significance that social issues
play in our daily lives. American
support for same-sex marriage is
now at a record high of 50 percent,
and polls show this number will
only grow in the future. We learn
at such a young age that individual
liberty and justice is what built our
country, so why shouldn't same-
sex couples have the same liberties
as everyone else?
It's time for Republicans to face
the changing attitudes of the 21st
century and realize that unless
they re-evaluate their attitudes
and work to become more accept-
ing, they will not have the support
necessary to be a strong contender
in today's political scene.

For the first time since 2004,
the No.5 Michigan rowingteam is
on top of the Big Ten.
After four of the six races on
Sunday in Indianapolis were com-
pleted, the Wolverines sat in third
place, needing victories in the first
and second-varsity eight races.
Michigan was down by 13 points
to first-place Ohio State heading
into the final two events.
The Wolverines inched closer
to the top when its second-varsity
eight boat cruised to a victory in

its race. They never trailed, jump-
ing out to a lead from the begin-
ning of the race and won by eight
seconds. The win narrowed the
gap to seven points behind the
Buckeyes.
And in the final race of the day,
the first-varsity eight clinched the
title for Michigan, beating Ohio
State by more than five seconds.
The Wolverines finished with
147 points, just two more than the
Buckeyes and 15 more than third-
place Wisconsin.
The championship is the fifth in
program history.
Earlier in the day, the Wolver-

ines took third place in the first
and second-novice eight races,
and the first-varsity four in addi-
tion to a second-place finish in the
second-varsity four race.
Three Michigan rowers earned
first-team All-Big Ten honors:
seniors Julia Darnton, Emily
Eiffert and Felice Mueller.
The title all but ensures a bid
to the NCAA Championships, and
Michigan will find out its fate in
the Women's Rowing Selection
Show on Tuesday.
The NCAA Rowing Champion-
ships will take place May 25-27 in
West Windsor, N.J.

She added that while Title IX
became law 40 years ago, there
are still obstacles that are being
overcome.
"Women's boxing is just now
becoming an Olympic sport and

I'm very excited about that," Ali
said. "I didn't have that opportu-
nity when I started boxing."
Ali also spoke about the uplift-
ing power of Title IX. Overweight
and unconfident girls can raise
their self-esteem and better them-
selves through athletics, accord-
ing to Ali.
"Life can break us down, but I

feel that sports can build us back
up," Ali said
Kathryn Olson, the CEO of
WSF, said sports can help women
grow in several aspects of life.
"We want people to under-
stand the benefit of sport for girls
and young women and I person-
ally want people to take it to the
next level and look at what sports

has done for women in terms of
leadership, education and career
growth," she said.
As a co-director of SHARP,
Katherine Babiak - a University
professor in the School of
Kinesiology - said this is
SHARP's first year in existence
and that she's was pleased with
the event.

"This conference is one of our
first big major events and initia-
tives and we're really thrilled with
the turnout," Babiak said. "Having
been involved in sport all my life
I think that it is really important
to make sure that girls and women
always have access to opportuni-
ties for sport."
