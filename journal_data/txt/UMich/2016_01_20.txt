From the Daily: 

Recall Gov. 

Snyder

Organizations 
collect supplies, 
funds for affected 

citizens 

By LYDIA MURRAY

Daily Staff Reporter

In response to the Flint 

water crisis, students across 
campus are coming together 
to collect water bottles and 
monetary donations for the 
affected citizens of Flint and 
surrounding areas.

The Flint water supply has 

been contaminated with lead 
for multiple months, spurring 
health 
concerns 
for 
Flint’s 

citizens and garnering national 
outrage. 
The 
contamination 

began after the city switched 
from the Detroit city water to 
water from the Flint River in 
April 2014. The water from the 
river corroded the water pipes, 
allowing lead from the pipes 
to leech into the water. In the 
weeks following the change, 
residents began reporting a 
change in quality and adverse 
health effects.

Both Gov. Rick Snyder (R) 

and President Barack Obama 
have recently declared state and 
federal states of emergency in 
response to the crisis. Protesters 
have 
additionallycalled 
for 

Snyder’s resignation, claiming 
he was negligent in his delayed 
response to the crisis.

Joining many other groups 

across the state, University’s 
Prevention 
Research 
Center 

and 
the 
Michigan 
Youth 

Violence Prevention Center are 
partnering in a campaign called 
Fill-A-Truck for Flint. The 
campaign is now accepting both 
water bottle and cash donations, 
which will be delivered to 
Flint residents. Water bottle 
donations will be accepted 
until Friday in the School of 
Public Health lobby, and cash 
donations are being accepted in 
the Prevention Research Center 
office. The campaign aims to 
bring as much bottled water as 
they can collect to Flint to help 
the residents there.

Alison Grodzinski, School 

of Public Health employee and 
one of the organizers of the 
effort, said the center wanted 
to help out in any way possible 

Psychological 

factors determine 
reactions to cell 
phone notifications 

By ALEXA ST. JOHN

Daily Staff Reporter

If you find yourself checking 

your phone only to realize the 
vibration you thought you felt 
was non-existent, you may be 
more anxious when it comes 
to relationships.

Those who have higher 

attachment anxiety in their 
relationships are more likely 
to 
interpret 
ambiguous 

physical sensations as cell 
phone messages, according to 
recent University research. 
In contrast, people who have 
higher attachment avoidance 
are less likely to have these 
“phantom” experiences when 
they anticipate receiving calls 
or messages, and tend to be 

Michigan citizens 
must be allowed 
to use their vote to 
give the people of 

Flint justice

From The Michigan Daily

It is no secret that Gov. 

Rick Snyder (R) is not a fan of 
democracy. Two months into 
his first gubernatorial term, he 
signed Public Act 4 — a bill that 
would allow him to delegate total 
control over a democratically 
elected municipal government in 
the event the state government 
decided 
it 
was 
financially 

insolvent. Snyder utilized this 
bill in 2011 to appoint a financial 
emergency manager over the 
city of Flint, leading to a string of 
decisions overseen by Snyder that 
ultimately led to the water crisis 
decimating Flint today. As we’ve 
seen the crisis unfold, Snyder has 

taken democracy away from Flint 
and in the process ruined lives. 
Michigan voters must make their 
voices heard for justice in Flint 
by supporting a recall of Gov. 
Snyder.

Tuesday 
night, 
Snyder 

delivered his State of the State 
address, dedicating much of his 
speech time to the Flint Water 
Crisis. 
Snyder 
acknowledged 

the 
mistakes 
he 
and 
his 

administration have made, but 
made a number of concerning 
points regarding how he views 
the timeline of the disaster. 
Snyder began his overview of 
events by pointing to the Flint city 
council’s March 2013 vote, with 
emergency manager approval in 
April, to switch the city of Flint’s 
water supply to the Karegnondi 
Water Authority, a municipal 
cooporation Flint was a founding 
member 
of, 
but 
still 
under 

construction. 
Entirely 
absent 

from this discussion, however, 
was the chain of decisions that 
led to Flint’s switch from Detroit 

Ann Arbor Mayor 
says bill threatens 
voter knowledge

By BRIAN KUANG

Daily Staff Reporter

At Tuesday’s City Council 

meeting, a range of topics — 
from a new state law to the 
city’s planned deer cull— were 
discussed.

During the meeting, Council 

rebuked the state government 
of Michigan for a law that 
the city claims restricts its 
right to inform voters, voting 
unanimously in support of a 
resolution opposing the State 
Legislature’s Public Act 269, 
which Gov. Rick Snyder (R) 
signed on January 7.

Public Act 269 prohibits 

local officials from publicly 
disclosing information about 
ballot 
proposals 
within 
60 

days of an election. The bill 
has sparked debate throughout 
Michigan, 
with 
opponents 

raising concerns that it will bar 
public entities — such as cities 
and school districts — from 
distributing factual information 
about ballot initiatives.

During 
Tuesday’s 
council 

meeting, Ann Arbor Mayor 
Christopher Taylor emphasized 
the impact this act has on the 
voter.

Governor focuses 
on initiatives to 
ameliorate water 

quality in city 

By CAITLIN REEDY

Daily Staff Reporter

LANSING — At his 6th State of 

the State address Tuesday night, 
Gov. Rick Snyder (R) highlighted 

a number of issues, including 
thewater crisis in Flint and the 
large debt facing the Detroit 
Public Schools system.

Snyder drew a large crowd 

both inside and outside the state 
capitol building with hundreds 
showing up to protest on the 
steps, calling for his resignation. 
Many of those present noted their 
presence, including state senator 
Ken Horn (R—Saginaw), who 
highlighted the apologetic tone 
Snyder set. That tone, he said, 

differed from his past addresses.

“I thought it was very somber,” 

Horn said. “It was different 
than the seven other state of the 
unions I’ve been to as a member 
of the legislature. We dealt with 
the Flint water issue primarily 
and I think the governor set a 
tone that we are here to help. 
Mistakes were made on every 
different level.”

Key points made during the 

speech 
included 
a 
six-point 

plan to respond to the Flint 

water crisis, fixing Michigan’s 
deteriorated 
infrastructure, 

aiding the Detroit Public Schools 
system and the economic future 
of the state — particularly the 
future of the automotive industry 
and the trajectory it is currently 
on.

Snyder 
began 
his 
speech 

addressing the people of Flint, 
which served as the main focus of 
the address.

HI: 20

LO: 12


State of the State,” Snyder said. 
“I would like to address the 
people of Flint. I want to speak 
directly, honestly sincerely… The 
government failed you. I’m sorry 
most of all that I let you down. 
You deserve accountability. You 
deserve to know the truth and I 
have a responsibility to tell the 
truth.”

During the speech, Snyder said 

he will release all of his e-mails 
pertaining to the water crisis as 
well as a comprehensive timeline 
listing every step taken. He also 
announced plans to request $28 
million from the state legislature 
to 
provide 
additional 
bottled 

water and tap filters for affected 
homes, as well as treatment for 
the children suffering from lead 
poisoning.

“We need to make sure this 

never happens again in any 
Michigan city,” Snyder said. “I 
give the people (of Flint) my 
commitment that Michigan will 
not let you down.”

Snyder’s 
plan 
to 
hold 

individuals 
accountable 
also 

included replacing the former 
director 
for 
the 
Department 

of Environmental Quality Dan 
Wyant 
with 
incoming 
DEQ 

director Keith Creagh, who said 
in an interview he agreed with the 
governor’s words regarding the 
need for change.

“As I came in as a new director 

there are some things we need to 
address within the department. 
We need a culture change, we 
need to start with the outcome in 
mind,” Creagh said. “And have our 
goal be safe, clean drinking water 
to all citizens. What matters is the 
delivery of clean, fresh, safe water 
to residents.”

In a statement released after 

the address, Karen Christian, 
president of United Teachers of 
Flint and a math intervention 
teacher at Potter Elementary 
School 
in 
Flint 
Community 

Schools, urged the governor to 
adopt a more detailed plan for 
helping residents.

“The health and educational 

challenges facing Flint students 
and families for years to come are 
serious and require a detailed plan 
to identify and address the various 
issues coming at us,” Christian 
said. “We must help students with 
the real impacts of lead poisoning, 
like 
learning 
disabilities 
and 

behavioral issues. Gov. Snyder and 
leaders in Lansing need to act on 
detailed plans that gets students 

continuous access to primary 
care, early childhood education 
and supplements like calcium, 
vitamin C and iron, which may 
help mitigate the impacts of lead 
poisoning.”

Highlighted 
additionally 
in 

Snyder’s address was an initiative 
to create a commission for building 
21st century infrastructure in the 
state, aimed at finding out what 
the state needs and developing 
a plan on how to make the best 
investments.

“We need to get this right in 

Michigan for the long term,” 
Snyder said. “More than roads, 
we have a hidden problem… 
underground some pipes are over 
100 years old. Out of sight out 
of mind until we have a water 
problem.”

Though Flint was the main 

focus of the address, Snyder 
also commented on the growth 
of Detroit in the past few years. 
He said violent crime is down 
18 percent since 2010, derelict 
buildings are being torn down and 
electricity is spreading to once 
dark areas of the city. The city’s 
school system, however, faces 
mounting problems surrounding 
its current debt, which is currently 
at $515 million. Snyder said he 
plans to create a commission 
focused on 21st century education 
to address that debt and related 
issues statewide.

“As Detroit builds, it should 

give hope to other cities,” he said. 
“There is much more work that 
needs to be done, but progress is 
evident everywhere. Too many 
schools are failing at their central 
task… Let’s solve this problem and 
help the kids. The time to act is 
now.”

Snyder also touched on the 

state’s 
economy, 
noting 
that 

232 jobs are added every day 
in the state. He acknowledged 
this growth doesn’t reach every 
town, saying he plans to provide 
towns 
still 
struggling 
with 

unemployment not just with not 
money but also people to help 
them get back on track.

Before Snyder’s remarks, the 

Michigan Democratic Party held 
a press conference denouncing 
both the governor and state 
Republicans for the Flint crisis and 
other issues, accusing Snyder and 
legislators of creating a culture of 
secrecy within the government.

E. Royster Harper, vice president for student life, introduces herself to the CSG assembly and discusses her role within 
the administration at the CSG meeting in the Michigan Union on Tuesday.
CSG supports campus-wide 
efforts to aid Flint residents

Assembly 

members discuss 
ways they can help 

at meeting

By ANNA HARITOS

Daily Staff Reporter

At their meeting Tuesday, 

Central Student Government 
discussed coordinating efforts 
among student organizations 
over the Flint water crisis and 
resolutions to define the agen-
da of the semester. The body 
also hosted E. Royster Harper, 
Vice President of Student Life, 
as their guest speaker.

CSG 
President 
Cooper 

Charlton, 
an 
LSA 
senior, 

addressed the assembly on the 
importance of assisting exist-
ing efforts across campus aim-
ing to aid with the Flint water 
crisis.

“In the beginning of the 

year we talked a lot about 
uniting the three campuses in 
Ann Arbor — Central, North 
and South — and at that same 

time we also reached out to 
Flint and Dearborn so we can 
be a united voice when we talk 
about the University of Michi-
gan,” Charlton said. “Not just 
talking about Ann Arbor and 
not forgetting our brothers 30 
to 40 minutes away.”

Charlton called upon the 

body to reach out to stu-
dent organizations currently 
engaged in fundraising cam-
paigns and other forms of aid.

“This is an unbelievable 

opportunity for us to show 
support with the water crisis 
happening in Flint,” Charlton 
said. “We need need need to 
show support for Flint in this 
very terrible time.”

Guest Speaker
During her speech, Harp-

er shared several personal 
stories with the assembly, 
including her childhood, her 
relationship with the Uni-
versity and her involvement 
with social life at the Univer-
sity when she was a student. 
Among the policy topics she 
touched on were the forth-
coming University celebration 

for the bicentennial in 2017 
and parents weekend. She 
asked CSG, and all students, 
for ideas to help strengthen 
the planning and execution of 
both events.

CSG, in turn, asked Harper 

for constructive criticism and 
general advice going into the 
second semester. She outlined 
the importance of under-
standing the student body in 
response.

“I will offer you two words 

of advice,” she said. “I think 
that you need to move out-
side your own space and to 
really be asking people who 
are maybe different from you 
what’s working and what’s 
not. In addition, you need to 
listen with more than your 
ears. What is the person not 
saying — you have to represent 
the student body.”

In particular, she encour-

aged assembly members to 
consider their own identities.

“This is the time in your life 

to do your work around your 
own identity, and understand

Sexual assualt discrepancy

Officials at the University of 

Wisconsin have investigated a 
low number of sexual assault 
cases according to The Badger 
Herald. 

According to a report from 

the Badger Herald at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin, there are 
significant discrepancies in 
the number of sexual assaults 
reported at the school and 
the number of investigations 
pursued by the school’s admin-
istration.

The Herald examined 

recent statistics of sexual 
assault reports at the univer-
sity of Wisconsin over the 
course of the past five years. 

It was reported that only 67 
of about 735 of reported cases 
at the university have been 
investigated over the past 
half decade. The Herald also 
reported that from the cases 
investigated, only 27 students 
were found to be responsible 
and only three students were 
expelled.

by the marketing firm Fractl, 
examined rates of disciplinary 
action at institutions that have 
student residencies on campus.

According to the report, 

Ithaca College had the most 
drug-related disciplinary 
actions per 1,000 students in 
2014. Drug-related arrests also 
increased from five students 
in 2013 to 19 students in 2014. 
Coastal Carolina University 
had 1,058 disciplinary refer-
rals for alcohol violations dur-
ing the period surveyed.

after watching the crisis unfold 
and realizing the far-reaching 
impacts of the contaminated 
water.

“Our 
center 
has 
worked 

directly with the Flint community 
for over twenty years,” she said. 
“We know people who live in 
the community; they are our 
partners, our friends and our 

colleagues. We just wanted to be 
able to do something.”

The 
Black 
Student 
Union 

at 
the 
University 
has 
also 

started a GoFundMe campaign 
to raise money that will be 
directly donated to help the 
citizens of Flint. The funds 
will 
go 
to 
providing 
fresh 

fruits and vegetables — which 
help combat the effects of lead 
poisoning, according to LSA 
senior Christopher James, BSU 
mass communication chair — to 

be distributed at schools and 
childcare centers. The BSU is 
partnering with local elementary 
schools and the Community 
Foundation of Greater Flint in 
their efforts.

James said the BSU decided to 

contribute to the effort to support 
the residents of Flint after the 
increased national attention to 
the crisis.

“It’s 
getting 
national 

recognition now, but it’s always 
been 
a 
problem,” 
he 
said. 

“Nationally, everyone had been 
rallying behind them, so we 
thought we’d do the same thing 
here. We cannot be the leaders 
and the best and not help them 
out.” 

The 
Michigan 
Republican 

Party contributed to water bottle 
collection efforts Tuesday by 
collecting water bottles on the 
steps on the Michigan Capitol 
building.

During 
Tuesday’s 
State 

of the State Address, Snyder 

discussed several long and shot-
term funding efforts to aid the 
city, including a $28 million 
request for funds from the state 
legislature.

“This is a challenge we 

must work together to solve,” 
Snyder said. “We will not stop 
working for the people of Flint 
until every single person has 
clean water every single day, no 
matter what”

Using the Psychology Subject 

Pool, University researchers 
created 
an 
online 
survey 

to analyze the increasingly 
common 
phantom 
phone 

vibration phenomenon — which 
a cell phone user believes they 
felt a phone vibration or heard 
a notification erraneously. The 
survey consisted of different 
measures to gauge the link 
between the sensation and 
the subject’s attachment style 
in relationships, considering 
anxiety responses vs. avoidance

evolutionary 
theory 
to 

understand 
the 
psychology 

of behavior, and has done 
previous work with attachment 
styles, which are ways we feel 
attachment to others. He was 
also part of a previous study 
with a former UROP research 
assistant who observed people 
and saw that cell phone use is 
contagious.

The project began with 

looking into the intersection 
of virtual social space and 
in-person space, specifically 
researching social media. 

“If you have a couple of 

people 
and 
they’re 
sitting 

together in a coffee shop and 
talking 
together, 
and 
one 

person picks up their cell 
phone, the other person is more 
likely to do so,” Kruger said.

Considering 
this 

phenomenon, 
research 

assistant Jaikob Djerf, an LSA 
junior, suggested researching 
phantom vibration, or phantom 
cell phone ringing.

“I was curious why some 

people feel it more than others, 
why people are even feeling it 
in the first place,” Djerf said. 
“It’s a cultural phenomenon — 
so many people do experience 
it, and it’s significant in the 
sense that we found personality 
traits 
that 
influence 
this 

phenomenon.”

Though Kruger said the 

phenomenon was something 
he has experienced before 
while driving, he was at first 
unaware this was a common 
sensation. However, because 
there is not much research 
being done about phantom 
vibration, Kruger said they 
designed the study to analyze 
several different aspects that 
were related to this sensation.

“In one way, [cell phones are] 

a practical device,” Kruger said. 
“You can get information, you 
can find out where the bus is, 
you can read the news. But it’s 
also your connection to social 
world, with Facebook, Twitter, 
the other different social media 
applications and websites.”

Some of the reasoning behind 

having attachment cravings is 
simply individual differences, 
Kruger said. However, he noted 
a craving for reassurance could 
be a combination of genetic 
variation and environmental 
and 
developmental 

experiences. 
Normally, 

attachment style develops in 
infants and young children and 
can potentially in adult social 
relationships.

“Because the cell phone isn’t 

just this objective, practical 
tool for objective information, 
because 
it 
has 
the 
social 

component, detection is going 
to be influenced by these 
psychological 
factors, 
such 

as a craving for relationship 
stimulation,” he said.

Djerf said researchers used a 

popular personality scale called 
the Big Five to create their 
survey. The Big Five is a five-
factor model which refers to the 
five dimensions psychologists 
use in analyzing personality 
— 
openness, 
agreeableness, 

conscientiousness, neuroticism 
and extraversion.

According to Kruger, inn 

addition to the Big Five, the 
researchers 
also 
used 
the 

Dark Triad, another group of 
personality traits psychologists 
use that holds a negative 
connotation. 
The 
Dark 

Triad 
includes 
narcissism, 

Machiavellianism 
and 

psychopathy, indicating that 
scoring high in these traits is 
related to malevolence.

Kruger said the researchers 

also made their own scale about 
phantom cell ringing, asking 
if the participant had ever 
experienced it, and if so, how 
often and how bothersome the 
sensation was. The three types 
of 
stimulation 
highlighted 

in the survey included a cell 
phone’s ringing, vibration and 
notification.

Among the most common 

sensation felt by those surveyed 
was a phantom vibration, in 
which people feel something on 
their skin that might be simple 
sensation, but they interpret 
the sensation as their phone 
buzzing.

“This could be due to the 

ambiguity of the stimulus,” 
Kruger 
said. 
“Sounds 
are 

more distinguishable, and it is 
more difficult to have a visual 
hallucination than it is to 
interpret a tactile sensation.”

With the new and rapidly 

developing state of technology, 
cell 
phones 
and 
social 

networking, 
Kruger 
said 

the world is only starting to 
understand the psychological 
dynamics and implications of 
objects like cell phones. 

“Still, it just kind of shows 

at least some people might 
be too dependent on this cell 
phone 
technology, 
so 
the 

recommendation is it might 
be good practice to sometimes 
not have your phone on or not 
constantly be checking these 
applications.”

“(Public 
Act 
269) 
would 

prevent factual communication 
about matters of communal 
interest from municipal bodies 
and elected officials, and thereby 
impedes voter knowledge in the 
voting booth,” Taylor said. “It 
warrants repeal.”

Councilmember 
Graydon 

Krapohl (D–Ward 4), who also 
opposes the law, emphasized 
the significance of passing the 
resolution.

“I don’t want to be known as 

the king of resolutions opposing 
state actions, but our voice does 
matter when it comes to issues 
like this in Lansing,” Krapohl 
said, adding that Ann Arbor 
would be joining numerous 
other cities in protesting the 
law.

City Council also heard public 

comments from Ann Arbor 
residents who opposed the city’s 
deer cull — a group of Ann Arbor 
residents who support the city’s 
plan to kill a portion of Ann 
Arbor’s deer population — as has 
been typical at recent meetings.

In addition to criticizing 

councilmembers, multiple anti-
cull activists also criticized 
the pro-cull group Washtenaw 
Citizens for Ecological Balance, 
accusing it of having unfair 
influence on the council.

Ann Arbor resident Lorraine 

Shapiro pointed to recently 
disclosed 
e-mail 
exchanges 

between councilmembers and 
members of WC4EB to argue 
that they had undue influence 
over other citizens when the 
council was still deliberating 
over the cull in 2015.

“It is apparent that WC4EB 

has 
privileged 
access 
to 

councilmembers that I and 
others do not,” Shapiro said, 
referring to the e-mails. “We are 
being governed behind a cloak 
of secrecy.”

In an interview after the 

meeting, 
three 
members 
of 

WC4EB 
dismissed 
these 

accusations as absurd.

WC4EB 
member 
Bernie 

Banet said the communications 
his 
association 
had 
with 

members of City Council were 
completely normal and that the 
accusations were an attempt to 
distort reality.

“All 
groups 
were 

communicating with council as 
we have a constitutional right 
to do, we have every right to 
petition our government,” Banet 
said. “The notion that there were 
some improper connections or 
magical power, other than the 
information that we provided is 
kind of laughable.”

scandals like the poisoning of 
Flint’s children with lead and 
the throwing away of $134 
million 
on 
new 
legislative 

offices the state doesn’t need 
and can’t afford,” said Brandon 
Dillon, chair of the Michigan 
Democratic party.

Snyder ended his remarks 

by committing to the state of 
Michigan to fix the problems he 
outlined, admitting to making 
mistakes during the last years of 

his term.

“Challenges 
we 
face 
in 

Flint, Detroit and beyond are 
serious but solvable,” he said. 
“The question is can we come 
together today. Every single 
citizen depends on us and we 
need to give them a better, 
brighter future. They deserve 
it.”

For 
state 
and 
federal 

Democrats, the reaction to the 
address 
was 
predominantly 

skeptical of Snyder’s plan for 
Flint’s future.

In a statement released by 

his office, U.S. Sen. Gary Peters 
(D–Mich.), 
condemned 
the 

governor’s plan for moving 
forward with the Flint crisis.

“While I was pleased to hear 

the Governor speak directly 
to the people of Flint, I believe 
the plan he outlined tonight fell 
short of what is needed to fully 
address the extensive needs of 
Flint residents suffering from 
lead exposure, especially Flint’s 
children,” Peters said.

Lonnie 
Scott, 
executive 

director of Progress Michigan, 
echoed 
Peters’sentiments 
in 

a statement released Tuesday 
night, also highlighting the 
organization’s 
dedication 
to 

hold the state accountable.

“While it’s a good first 

step 
for 
the 
Governor 
to 

release these emails, Progress 
Michigan remains committed 
to advocating for a complete 
repeal of the exemption for the 
Governor and legislature in our 
FOIA laws,” Scott said. “It’s 
nice that now that the spotlight 
of national media is shining a 
light on Snyder’s failures that 
he decides to give lip service to 
transparency. We will continue 
to shine a spotlight on the 
Governor to encourage action 
and not just empty words.” 

other people,” she said. “It 
takes just a little bit of courage 
to be uncomfortable enough 
to understand life from other 
people’s point of view.”

Resolutions
A 
new 
resolution 
on 

increasing 
voter 
registra-

tion on campus was brought 
to the assembly floor during 
Tuesday’s meeting. The pro-
posal sought to install a popup 
window on Wolverine Access 
about registering when stu-
dents register for classes to 
make the voter registration 
process easier for students.

The resolution was passed 

to the finance and resolutions 
committee for further review.

The body also voted on win-

ter CSG election dates with 
a resolution that had been 
brought to the table last week. 
The resolution was passed, 
with applications for candida-
cy due the week before spring 
break.

Among 
old

brought back to the table was 
a resolution to amend CSG’s 
2016 $400,000 winter semes-

enact it.

Flint residents file 
lawsuits against city

Flint residents filed two 

new class action lawsuits on 
Tuesday against city and state 
officials regarding the water 
crisis, according to MLive. 
The plaintiffs argue that water 
bills since April 2014 should be 
considered void as the water was 
unsuitable for consumption.

Families involved in filing 

the lawsuits accused officials 
of supplying contaminated 
water from the Flint River to 
citizens as a cheaper alternative 
to receiving Lake Huron water 
from the city. They highlighted 
that government officialls at 
all levels failed to provide safe 
water to residents and want 
compensation for personal and 
physical injuries. 

On Tuesday, the request for 

the preliminary injunction was 
filed at the circuit court level 
to pursue the lawsuit. The city 
of Flint, the state Receivership 
Transition Advisory Board and 
other individual officials were 
listed as the defendants. 

DPS plan to move

second “sickout” 
protest

Detroit Public School 

teachers are deciding to 
continue protesting the quality 
of their buildings, inaccesable 
wages, and crowded classrooms 
by staging a second protest, The 
Detroit Free Press reported.

 Teachers boycotted their 

classrooms last Wednesday by 
unanimously calling in sick, 
effectively closing schools in 
five districts.

Two other demonstrations, 

hosted by Detroit Federation 
of Teachers union and a 
second group of parents and 
community members, will 
occur in tandem with the 
sickout in a show of solidarity

University receives 
NIH grant to 
study back pain

University researchers 

received a $1.4 million grant 
from the National Institutes of 
Health to investigate the cost of 
back pain treatment ouside the 
primary care system, according 
to a University press release. 
They will also examine the 
impacts of complimentary and 
alternative medicine providers, 
such as chiropractors. 

The U.S. Department of 

Health and Human Services 
noted that back pain is a 
common reason for primary 
care visits, but predicts 
primary care physicians will 
decrease signigicantly by 2020. 
Consequently, researchers 
claim the study will be an 
important and timely topic for

Water and Sewage Department to the Flint River 
as an interim source. While it is true that Flint’s 
city council did democratically approve the 
switch to the KWA, there is no evidence show-
ing the decision to use the Flint River as an inter-
im source was made in any democratic manner, 
and instead was made by Snyder’s appointee. 
This misleading statement is characteristic of 
the governor’s handling of the disaster in Flint.

Despite a majority of Michigan voters in 2012 

voting to overturn Public Act 4, Snyder signed 
a modified version of the law a few weeks later, 
giving more options to local municipalities 
declared insolvent than just emergency man-
agement. But the choice of whether or not stay 
under emergency management was not given 
to the people of Flint or other Michigan cities 
previously under emergency management prior 
to the modified law. They were left under the 
authority of whomever Snyder chose to appoint, 
with no control over the actions of their own 
local governments. When Snyder chose to defy 
the will of the people who elected him, he sig-
naled that the responsibility for what would 
happen next would fall solely on his shoulders.

Now it’s January 2016, and Snyder is just 

beginning to deal with the consequences of his 
inaction. It has been a year since Flint was found 
in violation of the Safe Water Drinking Act, yet 
Snyder’s appointee Darnell Earley told Flint citi-
zens it would be too expensive to switch back to 
Detroit water. It’s been six months since the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency expressed 
concern over lead levels in Flint’s water, yet 
Snyder’s administration told everyone to relax 
in July 2015. It’s been four months since pedia-
trician Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha raised alarm 
about rising lead levels in vulnerable Flint chil-
dren’s blood, yet Snyder’s administration has 
just begun to mobilize a significant response to 
the crisis, with President Barack Obama most 
recently agreeing to declare the situation a state 
of emergency.

Snyder’s inaction on this issue — despite 

forcefully installing himself as the only elected 
official responsible for the people of Flint — has 
left us with no confidence that he can solve this 
catastrophe. Snyder has demonstrated repeat-
edly that this was not an issue on his mind until 
professionals and the media brought it to nation-
al attention.

From the time Snyder entered office in 

2011, he has continually demonstrated that his 
administration’s number-one priority would 
be to save the state money, apparently even 
at the cost of lives. Upon taking office, Snyder 
signed the most expansive emergency man-
ager program in the nation. Before the new 
law, Michigan’s emergency manager program 
functioned like most other states’ in that it 
allowed state governments to appoint repre-
sentatives to oversee municipal finances for 
cases in which they became insolvent. But soon 
after taking office, Snyder made Michigan the 
only state that allows the state government to 
appoint a single individual to take control over 
entire municipalities, requiring city councils 
and mayors to get approval from the governor’s 
appointees for all actions. These appointees 
could control everything in municipalities, 
from firefighter’s contracts to sewage mainte-
nance. They serve solely at the pleasure of the 
governor, making them the optimal opportu-
nity for Snyder to implement his cost-cutting 

agenda anywhere he saw fit, with no interven-
tion from municipal governments.

The crisis in Flint is a direct result of the 

subversion of municipal democracy under this 
law. Elected representatives of the people of 
Flint might have had the forethought to realize 
that running a cheaper water source through 
lead pipes 19 times more corrosive than the 
previous source might not be the best for their 
constituency’s health. Flint’s elected represen-
tatives would have switched back to Detroit 
water when residents started complaining of 
foul-tasting water and rashes. They might have 
realized that charging people for water that 
is unsafe to drink, and then shutting off water 
when residents didn’t pay, might not make for 
the best governance, yet this is still somehow 
actually happening. But Snyder’s appointed rep-
resentatives did none of these things, because 
the only thing they were accountable for was the 
spreadsheet showing Flint was saving money.

That’s not to say no blame is to be shared 

with Flint’s government. Despite being power-
less, Flint’s mayor and city council could have 
been far more vocal in bringing attention to 
the plight of Flint, and not could have not dis-
missed concerns over water quality. But while 
accountability in the Governor’s Mansion has 
yet to come, Flint’s government rejected its 
Incumbent Mayor Dayne Walling in favor of 
current Mayor Karen Weaver last November. 
However, despite being under financial emer-
gency for more than four years, the apparent 
cost-saving emergency management system 
still has not restored democracy to Flint. Flint’s 
newly elected mayor still lacks her full author-
ity, because the city has still been controlled 
by a Receivership Transition Advisory Board, a 
board made up of unelected state and local offi-
cials designed to transition the city back to self-
governance, since last April.

That leaves only one elected official to be held 

accountable for the actions that have plagued 
Flint: Snyder. If a local mayor or council member 
took actions that led to the poisoning of his or 
her constituents, they would at the very least be 
denied another term. The only option Michigan 
residents have to hold Snyder properly account-
able, since he is serving his second of two terms, 
is to recall him from office. Michigan law allows 
a governor to be recalled provided a petition 
signed by 25 percent of voters in the last guber-
natorial election to put the issue on the ballot. 

There is just one problem: The bipartisan 

Board of Canvassers, the board appointed by 
the governor to supervise elections, has rejected 
multiple petitions from Detroit pastor Angelo 
Scott Brown on grounds from purely techni-
cal to that the actions Snyder has been accused 
of happened in his first term, and therefore 
he cannot be held responsible for them in his 
second. We find such logic outrageous and 
unbecoming of a democratic society. There 
shouldn’t be a statute of limitations on an elect-
ed official’s exploitation of a vulnerable popula-
tion for political gain. We call on the Board of 
Canvassers to accept one of the many currently 
pending petitions to right this wrong. 

From the time Snyder entered office, he has 

demonstrated a lack of regard for the demo-
cratic process and has left Flint powerless. 
Now, Michiganders must be allowed to use 
their vote to give the people of Flint justice 
for the life-changing choice they never got to 
make.

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

O

n Dec. 3, along with several of my 
peers, I attended a fireside chat with 
University Pres-

ident Mark Schlissel. 
This was meant to be a 
forum for us to ask him 
questions — anything we 
wanted to hear him talk 
about. Schlissel opened 
the session by describing 
these meetings as the 
most effective way for 
him to “feel the pulse” of 
the student body.

However, after leav-

ing the chat and reflect-
ing on the evening, I 
realized he had not actu-
ally been interested in 
listening to our words, or even in seriously 
considering our questions. Instead, Schlissel 
was there as a mouthpiece to dictate Univer-
sity policy.

One 
of 
Schlissel’s 
most 
puppet-like 

moments was when he tried to answer my 
question, which concerned the Divest and 
Invest campaign that has garnered attention 
on campus over the past year or so. My ques-
tion to Schlissel went something like this: In 
continuing to invest heavily (around $1 bil-
lion) in the fossil fuel industry, Schlissel has 
to be considering the inherent utility of fossil 
fuels, especially for a massive research hub 
like the University. Well then, does Schlissel 
only intend to divest that large sum once that 

utility has vanished? If so, wouldn’t the state 
of our climate have already devolved at that 
point past any hope of salvation?

The answer I got went something like this: 

The University is, in fact working actively to 
combat climate change. Schlissel mentioned 
the recent $80 million (not much when com-
pared to $1 billion) investment in a wind 
turbine, as well as other green philanthropy 
efforts, the installation of the Graham Sus-
tainability Institute and environmental 
studies courses that “undergrads like me” 
can take.

Initially, nothing that he was saying irked 

me — this all changed when he declared that 
Divest and Invest wastes its time trying to 
change the University’s investment portfo-
lio. He argued that the way the University 
spends its money is not where the real change 
happens — it happens, according to Schlissel, 
at City Hall, by the lawmakers. City Hall, he 
told me, is where we should turn our atten-
tion, because the University’s finances would 
not change anything; divesting would be 
largely a “symbolic” effort. Instead of focus-
ing on this symbolism, he argued, students 
ought to focus on changing the laws them-
selves.

I have several responses. First, in 2013, 

the city of Ann Arbor already voted in favor 
of divestment. The vote was spurred by the 
work of activists such as my peers working 
for the Divest campaign. So, much of the battle 
at City Hall has already been done. The next 
step for student activists ought to focus on our 

Schlissel dismisses divestment

S

ounds pretty racist to me” – @
Sporty1546

This was the response I 

received just minutes after tweeting 
that I would be attending a national 
solidarity event, aimed at ending 
racial injustices on college campus-
es, hosted by the Black Liberation 
Collective.

I wish I could say this remark was 

an outlier. That it was of few I can 
recall over the past six years I’ve 
attended the University. Instead, 
what my experience has been — a 
sentiment that is clearly shared by 
Black students nationwide — is that 
this type of misinformed hostility is 
commonplace.

As a Black woman, I have two 

salient, visible identities that cause 
me to differ from the vast majority 
of people in power in this country. 
Though I can’t isolate one identity 
from the other — I will never expe-
rience life as a woman who isn’t 
Black or as a Black person who isn’t 
a woman — it continually seems to 
me that larger society has compas-
sion and empathy for only one of 
these struggles.

At Michigan, we have several 

residence halls and living commu-
nities exclusive to women. There 
are committed student groups, 
Greek organizations and health 
clinics whose purposes are attend-
ing to the needs of women — many 
of whom receive financial support 
from the University. Societally, we 
create TV shows and movies to 
reveal the growth and support that 
can arise from close-knit, wom-
en-only friendships. We raise our 
daughters in Girl Scouts and teach 
them to keep a “girl code,” recog-
nizing that building and maintain-
ing close friendships with other 
girls is essential. We let them have 
girls-only parties, acknowledging 
that introducing others into the mix 
changes the chemistry of the inter-
actions. The concept of having small 
aspects of our world dedicated for 
women only simply isn’t taboo.

But when Black people crave and 

carve out those same avenues for 
ourselves, it’s attacked. Considered 
exclusive. Unfair. Counter to racial 
harmony. “That’s not what Dr. King 

wanted…” they say.

While everyone isn’t on the same 

page about gender-based oppres-
sions, many, if not most, people view 
disparities in success across gender 
groups attributable to the world 
we grew up in, not to individuals 
themselves. We generally agree 
that although born with equivalent 
potential, historical precedent and 
our present culture erodes away 
opportunities available for people 
who aren’t men. But that same view 
— the view that all groups originate 
with the same capacity, but some 
are subject to forces outside of their 
control that prevent them from hav-
ing equal participation in society 
— isn’t extended to Black people. 

We don’t get Lean-in circles, we get 
we get death threats. We don’t get 
a #62MillionGirls campaign, we 
get told, “I wish these … protesters 
were this passionate about looking 
for jobs, education and avoiding teen 
pregnancy” (@RWSurferGirl). Our 
government and universities aren’t 
saying, “It’s on Us,” they’re saying 
“it’s on you.”

People think if they can’t see or 

conceptualize 
racial 
advantages, 

there must not be any to be seen. 
And honestly, I can see how that 
would happen. Just as health is a 
crown that only the sick can see, the 
benefits of being white are rarely 
visible to those who receive them. 
That’s the thing about privilege — 
it’s about all of the adjustments you 
never need to make, the hesitations 
you never have, the questions you 
never need to ask yourself. I under-
stand that. But what I don’t under-

stand — and frankly, what I have 
little sympathy toward — is why, 
after being informed, people are so 
slow on the uptake.

From our Black Student Union’s 

#BBUM — Being Black at the Uni-
versity of Michigan — campaign to 
the Ferguson protests to the events 
at the University of Missouri: the 
hunger strike, football players refus-
ing to play and numerous demon-
strations, my community has given 
ample evidence as to the many injus-
tices we face. Yet it falls on blind 
eyes and deaf ears.

We as a society recognize that 

certain groups need sacred spaces. 
We know that there are benefits that 
those groups get from being in com-
munities with one another, and we 
allow that. We accept that people 
who have commonalities in an area 
so intrinsic to who they are need 
and flourish in spaces separate from 
the watchful eyes of people who just 
won’t get it. That’s why we have pro-
fessional women’s organizations, 
Alcoholics Anonymous and sexual 
assault survivor support groups. 
Not because the people in them are 
broken or weak or less-than, but 
because we know they are going 
through some things that someone 
who doesn’t face those challenges 
just can’t understand. Life is harder 
for them in a million ways that an 
outsider can’t imagine, and they 
need to feel safe to talk about and 
strategize around that.

Unless, of course, they’re Black.
If they’re Black, then a solidarity 

event is discriminatory and moving 
this country backward. If they’re 
Black, it’s conspiracy brewing, and 
seeing things that aren’t really 
there. If they’re Black, organizing 
is rioting and promoting violence. If 
they’re Black —

Well, if they’re Black, that’s where 

you’ll find me. Because with them — 
with us — is about the only place I feel 
welcome right now.

campus. But surely Schlissel already 
knows that — clearly he just wanted 
to evade my question, which probed 
at direct action the University could 
take in response to climate change, 
an issue that the global commu-
nity is beginning to approach with 
increasing levels of urgency.

In his response to my question, 

Schlissel did articulate that divest-
ment as a symbolic action was 
among the “strongest” arguments 
he had heard in this debate. He went 
on: “If you could convince me that 
the University of Michigan shifting 
its investment portfolio away from 
fossil fuel companies would actu-
ally hasten our transition to renew-
ables, then I’d think about it.”

Here’s how divestment helps 

speed up this transition: Convinc-
ing people to live more sustainable, 
less wasteful lives is only possible if 
those same people live in a culture 
where that lifestyle feels popular, or 
as if they are a part of a new, exciting 
trend. In other words, there needs 
to be a fundamental cultural shift 
in the direction of sustainability; an 
excellent first place to start for that 
shift, here on campus, would be the 
University divesting from the fossil 
fuel industry. The symbolism and 
the transition are integrally linked, 
and Schlissel misses this crucial 
point in the standard response he 
has been giving to students — myself 
included — throughout his tenure.

I took issue with another part 

of Schlissel’s response — specifi-
cally, his telling me that students 
should not focus on the campus cli-
mate around this issue, but should 
instead advocate for laws that we 

agree with. This dismissal of the 
divestment activism on this campus 
contradicts the fundamental notion 
— shared among all of us, I believe 
— that this University is meant to be 
a home. And in any home, the chil-
dren — we students — ought to be 
able to fight for the change they wish 
to enact, to be able to negotiate with 
their parents — the administration — 
freely and honestly. They should not 
be dismissed.

Furthermore, Schlissel and I dis-

agree most fundamentally about the 

meaning of money and the impact it 
can have. Divestment is crucial and 
worthwhile, even though the Uni-
versity will never be able to single-
handedly shut down the fossil fuel 
industry. If we divest, at least we 
would not explicitly support it. In 
the famous “Civil Disobedience”, an 
essay that has guided social move-
ments throughout the 19th and 20th 
centuries, Henry David Thoreau dis-

cusses the power our spending holds, 
and how it can have a profound 
effect on the society we inhabit. Fur-
thermore, Thoreau argues that any 
citizen has the power to advocate for 
the change they believe in. There are 
actions we can all take to fight back 
— specifically, we all control how we 
spend our money, and we control 
which corporations to support. If we 
ignore this power we have, not only 
are we wasting an opportunity to 
fight, but also, most crucially, we are 
complicit in the harmful activities 

of the politically and economically 
dominant groups.

Let me just be clear: Schlissel 

understands the logic of divest-
ment as a means of civil disobedi-
ence. The problem must therefore 
be that Schlissel and the moneyed 
interests he represents are sim-
ply unwilling to divest from fossil 
fuels, perhaps because of their own 
interest in profit-making.

Instead of seeming to dismiss 

this movement — and, by exten-
sion, the work of the students he is 
supposed to serve — as a waste of 
time, Schlissel ought to heed Tho-
reau’s words. In our case, the Uni-
versity has $1 billion invested in an 
industry that is killing our planet, 

acting without any consideration 
for the scientific consensus that 
climate change shares a direct link 
to human activity. The University 
is consciously complicit, then, in 
the proliferation of an industry 
driven by ignorance, destruction and 
greed.

RECALL From Page 1A


January is the month for 

fixing things. For some, it’s a 
body fix — gym memberships 
are purchased, alarm clocks 
are set, extra champagne from 
New Year’s 
Eve is tossed 
out. Others 
set 
career-

oriented 
goals 
— 

following 
up with job 
recruiters, 
making 
an 

effort 
to 

stay on top 
of projects, 
finally 
asking 
for 
that 

promotion (or at least getting 
your internship housing paid 
for over the summer).

But there are other areas of 

our lives needing to be “fixed” 
that go unnoticed each year, 
because they don’t call for extra 
obligations. We’re conditioned 
to think that “New Year, New 
Me” means adding more to our 
plate — whether that be more 
veggies, morning spin sessions, 
a night class called “How to 
Be Successful Post-Graduation 
101” — but sometimes it calls 
for 
the 
opposite: 
letting 

ourselves breathe. This year, 
my New Year’s resolution isn’t 
to be more organized, more 
productive, or more focused 
on school, running, or even my 
post-graduation plans.

Instead, I’m resolving to 

relax. It’s easier said than done.

I bet this sounds familiar: 

finals week, a tiny table at 
Espresso Royale, laptop opened 
to a blank document, books 
piled high on a stool. I’d been 
staring at the computer screen 
for about 30 minutes, but my 
mind wasn’t on the paper I had 
to write; it was on the to-do 
list scrolling in the back of 
my head: finish essays, write 
cover letters, make flashcards, 
submit applications! There was 
so much to do that the bulk of it 
paralyzed me. I lashed out at my 
boyfriend when he stopped by 
to visit, saying he was wasting 
my time. Couldn’t he see that I 
didn’t have 20 minutes to talk?

Turns out, I did have time. 

And so does everyone else, 
no matter how busy they are 
(i.e. even those who have 
infinite to-do lists). Because 
as much as I think I’m being 
“productive” and “bettering” 
myself by taking on a Herculean 
workload, if all I’m left with 
is a blank document and an 
irritated boyfriend, I’ve really 
accomplished nothing.

So what should I be doing 

instead 
of 
unproductively 

stressing? Coloring. No, really.

If you haven’t heard of adult 

coloring books yet, you will 
soon. Filled with pages of 
beautifully intricate patterns, 
books like “Secret Garden” 
and “Enchanted Forest” by 
Johanna 
Basford 
or 
Emma 

Farrarons’ “The Mindfulness 
Coloring Book: Anti-Stress Art 
Therapy for Busy People” have 
topped bestseller lists in the 
United States. Sales especially 
skyrocketed over the holidays: 
Amazon reported to Fortune 
magazine that out of their top 10 
bestselling books in December, 
five were adult coloring books.

This 
DIY-art-therapy 

phenomenon 
has 
lead 

prestigious media outlets from 
the Atlantic and the New York 
Times, to NPR and CNN Health, 
to ask a key question: does 
it work? Can coloring really 
relieve stress for adults, or are 
they just a distraction from 
our problems? And my own 
question: is filling in a coloring 
book really a productive use of 
college students’ time?

To answer these questions, 

I sought out Psychology Prof. 
Nansook Park, director of the 

Michigan Positive Psychology 
Center on campus. Most of Park’s 
work focuses on mindfulness 
(the act of living in the moment 
and being open to experience) 
and its positive impact on 
individual health, particularly 
in 
regards 
to 
decreasing 

symptoms 
of 
anxiety 
and 

depression. At the University, 
Park regularly teaches a class 
called 
“Savoring,” 
which 

instructs students to be wholly 
present in their everyday lives 
— for example, to truly savor 
a piece of chocolate, a walk in 
the Arb or a conversation with 
roommates.

I asked for Park’s opinion on 

whether adult coloring books 
were just a fad or a legitimate 
mechanism to cope with stress 
and anxiety. Also, I asked 
whether or not she saw the 
coloring trend as a regression 
to childhood — a potentially 
serious issue, as students are 
at a critical stage of becoming 
independent and learning to 
face their problems. 

“It’s not fair to dismiss 

coloring as regressing,” Park 
said, who had observed two 
University 
faculty 
members 

coloring recently on their staff 
break. “There are too many 
studies that support the health 
benefits of simple tasks like 
coloring. Finishing a picture 
gives our brains the chance to 
zone out, similar to meditation, 
but it also gives us a sense of 
accomplishment — there’s color 
on the page where there wasn’t 
before.”

This sense of accomplishment 

— having a picture to show for 
our task — makes coloring a 
positive experience, which is 
why it not only gives people a 
momentary release from stress, 
but 
actually 
improves 
our 

moods.

“People 
are 
happier 

when 
they 
have 
positive 

experiences, like when they’re 
creating something or going 
somewhere,” Park said. “We 
zone out when we watch TV, but 
we aren’t necessarily happier 
when we come back to reality, 
because we haven’t been active 
participants in the task.”

Coloring differs importantly 

from other forms of creative 
expression, 
like 
writing 
or 

doodling, because it has a set 
structure. As the Atlantic put 
it, “Coloring offers that relief 
and mindfulness without the 
paralysis that a blank page can 
cause.” In a coloring book, the 
important decisions of form and 
layout have already been made 
for us — our only job is to pick 
a crayon.

“When 
we 
write, 
we’re 

forced to go into our heads 
and potentially face difficult 
issues,” 
Park 
explained. 

“Coloring is mindless. We aren’t 
solving our problems, which is 
why coloring books cannot be 
used to solve long-term issues 
such as anxiety or depression.”

“However,” Park continued, 

“Coloring books are a great 
tool for short-term stress relief. 
When you’re overwhelmed by 
stress to the point of paralysis, 
taking 20 minutes to color 
a picture gives your brain a 
necessary break. Afterwards, 
you’ll be able to face your 
problems with fresh eyes.”

Make a resolution to relax, 

then be more productive as a 
result. Sounds like a fresh start 
to me.

HAILEY 
MIDDLEBROOK
Phony, gilded Globes

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

Being 
an 
Asian 
American 

woman, movies with accurate rep-
resentations of my life experiences 
are extremely rare, if not nonex-
istent. Yet here I am, doing the 
opposite of boycotting white, male-

centric movies and – dare I say it? 
– enjoying them. What gives?

It’s a simple explanation: unless 

I want to sit in an empty space 
completely devoid of all media 
entertainment, I have to make 
compromises. I have to reclaim and 
rehabilitate the white male gaze to 
tease out elements with which I can 
identify.

Because even with all the prob-

lems inherent in inserting myself 
so fully into these characters, it also 
lets me reclaim positive elements. 
Take Catwoman’s character in 
“Batman.” Though she’s the villain 
and we shouldn’t like her, my mind 
searches for traits that encourage, 
even empower me. She’s fierce — a 
female role model who isn’t pas-

sive! Great! Never mind that she 
will never get to be the real hero 
and save the day. She’s hyper-sex-
ualized just to add eye candy for 
male viewers? Well, I embrace sex-
positivity, so I interpret her slink-
ing around in skintight suits with 
that lens instead.

Another example: “Boyhood’s” 

very white, middle class, American 
depiction of childhood. I left the 
theater with the goofiest grin on 
my face, nostalgic for the childhood 
experiences I never had. But I take 
the experiences of other people 
around me and use that to reconcile 
the gap between my life and what’s 
on the screen.

I’ve compromised. I enjoy this. I 

feel comforted, satisfied.

But should I be?
Regardless of how much I can 

find interesting and compelling 
characters to identify with in films, 
it’s still perpetrating the idea of 
what is normal and what is not. 
Though I smiled knowingly when it 
happened in “Boyhood,” I’ve never 
watched “Rugrats” or been to a 
baseball game. My family doesn’t 
have heartwarming Thanksgiv-
ing traditions. People are always 
shocked: “You never did that? Did 
you even have a childhood?” I did, 
but because white culture is the 
predominantly represented one, 
it doesn’t feel like I had the right 
childhood.

As a viewer, I can make things 

that are not relatable relatable to 
me. That is the joy and beauty of 
storytelling. You can take on the 
experiences of a secret agent solv-

ing a mystery, or a child dealing 
with a hard time, or a washed-up 
journalist grappling with identity, 
and it helps you connect your own 
experiences to someone else’s.

So when the industry doesn’t 

want to produce films with diverse 
backgrounds because audiences 

(hint, white males) cannot relate to 
them, that’s bullshit. If the majority 
of my movie-watching life involves 
learning to understand and empa-
thize with the stories of other gen-
ders, nationalities, races and even 
species, I think white males can 
learn to do it once in a while too.

FILM NOTEBOOK

By SHIR AVINADAV

Daily Arts Writer

Every year, the star-studded red 

carpet, weeks of speculation and 
buzz surrounding nominations 
and a hilarious, high-profile host 
(or hosts) comprise the indulgence 
and shameless ploy for media 
attention that is the Golden Globe 
Awards.

This year, both expected and 

unexpected titles and perform-
ers received awards. Among this 
year’s winners, there were many 
first timers, such as Lady Gaga 
(Best Actress in a Mini-Series, 
“American Horror Story: Hotel”) 
and Rachel Bloom (Best Actress 
in a Comedy Series, “Crazy Ex-
Girlfriend”). There were also 
veterans like Kate Winslett (Best 
Supporting Actress in a Drama, 
“Steve Jobs”), Aaron Sorkin 
(Best Screenplay, “Steve Jobs”) 
and Sylvester Stallone (Best Sup-
porting Actor, “Creed”) grace-
fully accepting their awards. 
The prestigious Cecil B. DeMille 
award was granted to the legend-
ary Denzel Washington (“The 
Equalizer”), making him only 
the third Black actor to receive 
the honor.

Some nominations and wins, 

however, were just baffling. The 
entire Motion Picture, Musical or 
Comedy category was a mixed bag 
of films dubiously touted as come-
dies (or musicals). Films like “Joy” 
and “The Martian” were nomi-
nated alongside “Trainwreck” and 
“Spy,” with “The Martian” taking 
home the Golden Globe. The only 
thing funny about “The Martian” 
was that it was placed in this cat-
egory at all.

What wasn’t funny at this year’s 

ceremony was Ricky Gervais’ per-
formance as host. Not only was 
his monologue a hollow critique 
of Hollywood’s shining stars, but 
it also slammed those responsible 
for putting him on the Globes stage 
for the fourth time. His incredulity 
at being asked back to host, given 

the backlash he receives each 
time, matched that of his audience. 
However, the almost certainty of 
criticism didn’t deter him from 
making his usual acerbic remarks.

Every time the camera cut to 

another mildly amused or insult-
ed guest, Gervais’ poor taste 
became more painfully obvious. 
His affronts ranged from crass 
remarks about Jeffrey Tambor’s 
role as a transgender woman 
on the Emmy-winning Amazon 
original series “Transparent,” to 
unrestrained innuendos about 
Bill Cosby’s sexual misconduct. 
His monologue and subsequent 
jokes seemed to have been given 
as little thought as the decision 
to bring him back as host. His 
usual antics were at best half-
hearted and at worst offensive.

Among the other presenters 

there weren’t many redeem-
ing 
moments 
of 
entertain-

ment. Jonah Hill (“Wolf of Wall 
Street”) showed up as the bear 
from “The Revenant” alongside 
Channing Tatum (“The Hateful 
Eight”), while America Ferrera 
(“Superstore”) and Eva Longoria 
(“Telenovela”) joked about get-
ting confused for other Latina 
actresses, eliciting laughs. Jamie 
Foxx (“Django Unchained”) did 
his best Steve Harvey impres-
sion, announcing “Straight Outta 
Compton,” which hadn’t been 
nominated, as the winner of best 
original score and drawing atten-
tion to the film’s snub. Otherwise, 
there was little else to distract 
from Gervais’ cringe-worthy com-
ments and the poorly produced 
awards ceremony. 

This year’s Globes pitted two 

notable Amazon original series 
against one another. Roman Cop-
pola and Jason Schwartzman’s 
“Mozart in the Jungle” beat out Jill 
Soloway’s “Transparent” for Best 
Comedy Series, and Gael Garcia 
Bernal (“Y Tu Mamá También”) 
took home the title of Best Actor in 
a Comedy Series.

It was a big night for “The Rev-

enant” as well — which received 
the award for Best Motion Picture 
Drama and earned its director, 
Alejandro González Inarritú the 
title of Best Director of a Motion 
Picture and Leonardo DiCaprio 
the title of Best Actor in a Motion 
Picture Drama.

Brie Larson received her first 

Golden Globe Award for her per-
formance in the drama “Room,” 
the touching story of a woman and 
her five-year-old son freed from 
captivity and finally experiencing 
the world outside. And Jon Hamm 
won his second award this year for 
his role as Don Draper, the stone-
faced advertising executive on 
“Mad Men.”

Jennifer Lawrence (“Joy”) beat 

out the other talented perform-
ers recognized in her category 
(though it is questionable whether 
Lawrence belonged in the comedy 
category at all). And it goes with-
out saying that Taraji P. Henson’s 
win, placing her among the slowly 
increasing ranks of women of color 
who have received awards for their 
roles on television, was both well-
deserved and entertaining. Her 
response to being told to wrap-up 
her acceptance speech was per-
fect: “Wait a minute. I waited 20 
years for this. You’re going to wait. 
Yeah, you’re going to give me a lit-
tle more time.”

It’s always inspiring to see tal-

ented artists get recognition for 
their hard work, but when award 
ceremonies designed to acknowl-
edge talent and hard work are 
driven by publicity and industry 
politics, the show becomes less 
appealing. Each year Hollywood 
lets the masses into its glamor-
ous world for a few hours, draw-
ing in audiences with this short 
window of opportunity to indulge 
in its façade of prestige. Yet, I will 
doubtlessly continue to watch, 
even though I know my joy for see-
ing artists I respect and admire 
getting acknowledgement is just 
an illusion.

Who needs this bachelor’s degree?

I love that, in “Bachelor” uni-

verse, you can fall in love after 
three weeks and one group date. 
 

I love that you can feel “things 
you’ve never felt before” for some-
one you call Jessica B. I love that 
you get a grace period of, like, 
three serious meltdowns before 
the bachelor can even see any-
thing past your boobs.

What I really love about “The 

Bachelor” is that it’s not real life 
— it is so far from real life, it exists 
in a different universe. “Bachelor” 
contestants are basically space 
aliens. 

“The Bachelor” universe is 

exempt from the laws of our own. 
 

There’s no politics, no religion and 
I don’t think I’ve ever heard any-
one talk about where they went 
to college (No, seriously, can we 
please figure this out? Where do 
I need to transfer to make “dog 
lover” a career?). It’s a universe 
where contestants are actu-
ally rewarded for their crazy 
behavior, because it’s a uni-
verse designed to entertain. For 
two hours every Monday night, 
we can escape to this universe 
where nothing matters except 
a hot guy and his 20 girlfriends.

As college students at the 

University, our lives can be pret-
ty stressful. Between classes, 
extracurriculars, volunteering 
and working, life is full of aca-
demically rigorous, intellectu-
ally challenging things. I feel 
lucky if I have 40 minutes at the 
end of my day to listen to “Seri-
al.” So with all of the craziness 
in our lives, who is anyone to tell 
us what to do with a single min-
ute of our free time? 

Reality TV is entertainment 

in its purest form. It’s mindless. 
It’s manipulated, sure, probably 
scripted to some degree, but who’s 
watching this for an accurate 
representation of the human con-

dition? Whether they’re watch-
ing for the time-lapse romance 
or to diagnose whatever clinical 
psychological disorders some of 
the contestants probably have, 
“Bachelor” fans simply come 
seeking entertainment, and there 
shouldn’t be any shame in that.

Once you’ve spent the better 

part of your day pursuing higher 
education and contributing your 
share to society, you should be 
free to do whatever gives your 
brain a well-deserved break. If 
calculus relaxes you or running 10 
miles clears your mind, I’m unrea-
sonably jealous and I’d like to 
know your secret. But if bad real-
ity TV or those Xbox games where 
you run around killing people are 
your thing, that is just as okay. Do 
whatever makes you happy, do 
whatever you don’t have to think 
about. 

The bottom line: I won’t tell you 

what to do with your “you time” as 
long as you don’t expect me to con-
tribute anything to society from 8 
to 10 p.m. on Monday nights. And I 
won’t tell you to watch “The Bach-
elor,” but if you do, you might find 
its mindlessness surprisingly com-
pelling.

COMEDY CENTRAL

A normal night for Daily Arts. 
‘Idiotsitter’ refreshes 
 

odd couple premise

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Comedy Central is known to 

cater its programming toward 
a predominantly young adult 
demographic, and its newest 
show, “Idiotsitter,” seems to 
fit that mold. 
Originally 
a 

six-episode 
web series in 
2014, 
“Idiot-

sitter” 
con-

tains 
the 

irreverence 
of 
“Worka-

holics” 
and 

the 
female-

empowered 
humor 
of 

“Broad City.” 
But as a whole, “Idiotsitter” 
works on its own as a refresh-
ing take on the “odd couple” 
premise with its hilarious lead-
ing stars and improvisational 
energy. 

The “sitter” is uptight Har-

vard grad Wilhelmina “Billie” 

Brown (Charlotte Newhouse, 
“Brainstorm”), 
who 
unwit-

tingly becomes the guardian 
and GED tutor of the “Idiot,” 
wealthy, 
fully-grown 
delin-

quent 
Genevieve 
“Gene” 

Russell (Jillian Bell, “Worka-
holics”). The plot sounds hack-
neyed, but Newhouse and Bell’s 
chemistry and the show’s guf-
faw-inducing 
ridiculousness 

are enough to make “Idiotsit-
ter” worthwhile.

While the pilot episode is 

mostly a simple storyline set-
up, it quickly establishes “Idi-
otsitter” ’s swift pacing and 
absurd 
jokes. 
After 
Gene’s 

father Kent (Stephen Root, 
“Office Space”) and his air-
headed wife Tanzy (Jennifer 
Elise Cox, “Web Therapy”) 
go out of town indefinitely, 
Gene throws a rowdy, alcohol 
and drug-fueled party at her 
mansion, much to Billie’s dis-
may. It’s typical to dismiss the 
banality of this scenario, with 
Billie being relegated as a strict 
authority over the party’s out-
of-control nature. But once Bil-
lie decides to indulge in letting 
loose through Gene’s encour-
agement, that’s when the fun 
(and best) parts of the episode 
begin. The two gals have a ball 
dancing to glitzy EDM music, 
doing horrible Austin Powers 
impersonations in the bathtub 
and playing Apples to Apples 
just with apples. 

At times, “Idiotsitter” seems 

like it can go off the rails at any 
moment. Yet it never glorifies 
the affluent lifestyle, nor does it 
forget to recognize the human-
ity of its characters. After Bil-
lie is hoofied — half-roofie, 
half-horse tranquilizer — by 
Gene and her “best, non-sex-
ual friend” Chet (Steve Berg, 
“Coogan Auto”), Billie becomes 
fed up with Gene and leaves. 
However, Gene apologizes and 
the two reconcile through their 
shared love for Patrick Swayze 
in “Dirty Dancing.”

“Idiotsitter” seems like the 

perfect career catalyst for Bell, 
who has consistently shown 
her knack for witty, deadpan 
humor in several film and TV 
roles, such as “22 Jump Street” 

and “The Night Before.” New-
house is also a perfect coun-
terpart to Bell, with both 
actresses building quips off one 
another. What makes “Idiotsit-
ter” a potentially inventive TV 
comedy is that Bell and New-
house don’t just subvert the 
stereotypes of their characters, 

but also add more comedic flair 
and edginess to them.

At first, Billie exudes the 

high-strung, 
Ivy 
League-

educated persona that feels 
all too familiar. But later on 
in the episode, she becomes 
more likable through the help 
of Gene, as they grow from 
completely opposite strangers 
to unlikely friends. Gene isn’t 
the clichéd spoiled girl, with a 
rude demeanor and unpleasant 
attitude. Her behavior comes 
from a child-like innocence, 
and her recklessness is more 
silly than plainly stupid — the 
opening scene involves her ask-
ing two police officers for sex 
while drunkenly riding a pony. 
Considering that both Bell and 
Newhouse are co-creators and 
co-writers of “Idiotsitter,” it’s 
hard not to appreciate their 
comedic efforts in crafting the 
characters so well.

Regardless of the undeniable 

talent behind “Idiotsitter,” the 
show still needs some work in 
developing 
the 
relationship 

between Gene and Billie from 
two very opposite women into 
something much more engross-
ing. “Idiotsitter” doesn’t quite 
reach the comedic heights of 
“Broad City” or “Workaholics” 
and probably won’t for a while. 
But with Bell and Newhouse 
at the acting and writing helm 
of the series, it’s bound to still 
provoke and charm Comedy 
Central’s audience.

Junior heavyweight Adam Coon (right) anchors a trio of wrestlers that have become known as “Murderer’s Row” for their dominance at the back end of meets.
“Murderer’s Row” leads Wolverines

By ORION SANG

Daily Sports Writer

It’s not often that one can find 

three wrestlers who perform 
well 
enough 
to 
deserve 
a 

nickname like the “murderer’s 
row,” but Michigan’s trio of 
junior 
Domenic 
Abounader, 

sixth-year senior Max Huntley 
and junior Adam Coon seem to 
fit the bill.

The 10th-ranked Wolverines 

have received great performances 
from their captains all season, and 
Friday’s dual meet against Illinois 
was no exception.

Heading into the final three 

matches of the meet, Michigan 
(3-0 Big Ten, 7-1 overall) found 
itself down, 12-14, against the 
13th-ranked Fighting Illini (0-3, 
9-3). But because Abounader, 
Huntley and Coon had yet to 

wrestle, the Wolverines weren’t 
worrying.

“If the dual’s tied or close at 

184 pounds, we’re going to win,” 
Huntley said. “It’s kind of like 
a murderer’s row. We all work 
very hard, we’re all top-10 guys, 
and I don’t see any team that 
could win two of the last three 
matches.”

Coon agreed with Huntley’s 

naming and assessment of the 
trio.

“It’s great having those two,” 

Coon said. “Those guys are just 
dominant on the mat. In the 
practice room, how hard they 
work, it shows on the mat. It’s 
death row when they meet those 
two, and I just try to follow 
along.”

With its victories over the 

Fighting 
Illini, 
Michigan’s 

so-called 
“murderer’s 
row” 

remained 
unbeaten 
in 
dual-

meet play. Their consistency has 
led them into the top 10 of the 
InterMat rankings for each of 
their respective weight classes, 
with Abounader ranked No. 10, 
Huntley ranked No. 6 and Coon, 
No. 4.

The Wolverines’ captains are 

not only proficient wrestlers, but 
are also good leaders, according to 
coach Joe McFarland.

“Those guys are just great 

role models,” McFarland said. 
“They’ve got a great work ethic 
and really focus on all the right 
things, on and off the mat. Put 
all three of those guys together 
and there’s really good leadership 
right there.”

Added Huntley: “Everything 

we do, we try to beat each other. 
We do the conditioning together 
in the morning, and we always 

wrestle.”

Besides leading through hard 

work, though, the three captains 
also exhibit a unique blend of 
different leadership styles. The 
approach for Huntley, the first 
three-time captain in Michigan 
wrestling history, has especially 
changed from previous years.

“I’m 
in 
more 
of 
an 

advisory role,” Huntley said. 
“(Abounader’s) taken over the 
vocal part. I’m more of the older, 
wiser captain. A lot of guys come 
to me for advice for cutting 
weight and things like that, and 
I try to lead by example now and 
leave the vocal stuff to the other 
captains.”

If 
the 
trio’s 
leadership 

mentality comes to fruition, 
opponents 
may 
be 
calling 

Michigan’s 
entire 
lineup 

“murderer’s row.”

Wolverines, Fisch 
extend agreement

Passing game 
coordinator 

reportedly re-ups 

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

Michigan football coach Jim 

Harbaugh said in December he 
was looking to lock up passing 
game coordinator Jedd Fisch 
to a contract extension. That 
deal is done, according to Sports 
Illustrated’s Thayer Evans, who 
reported Tuesday that Fisch 
signed a two-year extension 
worth between $650,000 and 
$750,000 per year, plus incentives.

Fisch, also the Wolverines’ 

quarterbacks and wide receivers 
coach, just wrapped up his first 
season under Harbaugh in Ann 
Arbor. He has been an assistant 
for nine different teams in 16 
years of coaching, never spending 
more than four years in one spot. 

The new extension secures Fisch, 
who has coached eight of his 16 
years in the NFL, before he gets 
snatched away by a professional 
team following the season.

Fisch, 
39, 
led 
a 
steady 

improvement 
in 
Michigan’s 

offense in 2015. Fifth-year senior 
Jake Rudock, a graduate transfer 
from Iowa, emerged to complete 
one of the best statistical seasons 
for a quarterback in Michigan 
history. He threw for 3,017 yards 
and 20 touchdowns against just 
nine interceptions.

Redshirt junior wide receivers 

Jehu Chesson and Amara Darboh 
and junior tight end Jake Butt 
totaled 2,145 of those yards on 
159 catches, and all three have 
decided to hold off on the NFL 
Draft and return for their final 
seasons in 2016. Fisch will have 
another stable of quarterbacks 
to grow. The leader could be 
Houston transfer John O’Korn, 
who has two years of eligibility 
remaining after he sat out in 2015.

Trio sparks Michigan win

By TYLER COADY 

Daily Sports Writer

While this weekend’s Michigan 

Invitational 
was 
technically 

just a tuneup for next weekend’s 
regular-season 
opener, 
the 

Michigan women’s tennis team’s 
trio of junior Ronit Yurovsky, 
sophomore Alex Najarian and 
freshman Brienne Minor played 
like it was anything but against 
Tennessee.

In all of the singles matchups 

between 
the 
14th-ranked 

Wolverines and the Volunteers, 
leads evaporated and deuce points 
went either way. As the madness 
ebbed and flowed, these three 
Michigan standouts found ways 
to get wins.

Yurovsky, who was named All-

Big Ten last season, fell into an 
early hole in her singles match 
against Tennessee’s Eve Repic. 
Facing a deficit and having made 
numerous 
unforced 
errors, 

Yurovsky looked out of sorts and 
out of sync.

Then, Yurovsky surfaced as she 

served her way to a 6-0 second-set 
win before pulling out a 6-3 third-
set win to clinch the match and 
seal an overall singles victory for 
Michigan.

“We all had slow starts,” 

Yurovsky said. “We all had that 
fight to get back into the match. 
It is nice to have all those girls 

playing by your side … and to get 
points for the team.”

With a seasoned veteran like 

Yurovsky setting the tone for 
a comeback, that spirit clearly 
rubbed off on Minor.

Minor, a newcomer to the 

team, played with a sense of 
composure and confidence in 
her first set, come-from-behind 
victory. Minor, down 5-4 with the 
game score tied at 30-30, laced a 
backhand shot down the line that 
nestled itself within the white 
chalk. That shot — a graceful but 
powerful backhander — proved to 
be the much-needed momentum 
boost that Minor needed.

While she went down again, 

this time 6-5, Minor quickly rallied 
to send the set to a tiebreaker. In 
the tiebreaker, it was a painless 
win for the true freshman as she 
won, 7-2. With a set victory in 
hand, Minor never looked back, 
dictating the play with her serve 
and groundstrokes, and winning 
the clinching set, 6-3.

“Usually when I am down, I 

just think about the team and that 
I need to pull this win out for the 
team,” Minor said. “I needed to 
make (the team) my number-one 
priority.”

As Yurovsky and Minor labored 

for wins, more drama unfolded on 
Najarian’s court. The sophomore, 
an All-Big Ten selection last year, 
had to channel all she had in order 

to fend off a valiant Volunteer 
challenge.

Najarian, after a 7-6 first-set 

victory, ran into a bit of trouble 
in the second set. After a string 
of unforced errors and trouble 
dealing with her opponent’s left-
handed serve, she found herself 
on the brink of having to play a 
third set.

“I knew I had to keep my 

energy up and not let her dictate 
the points as much, which led to 
me being down,” Najarian said. 
“She was hoping I was going 
to miss, and I just tried to take 
control.”

And take control she did. 

Najarian 
reasserted 
her 

service game, becoming more 
comfortable with her opponent’s 
serving and notching a string 
of winners to secure a 7-5 set 
victory.

Michigan 
coach 
Ronni 

Bernstein, who traversed much 
of the tennis facility throughout 
the day as she sought to keep 
an eye on all of her players, was 
happy with what she saw in the 
comeback victories.

“The matches are long, and you 

have to be able to keep your foot 
on the pedal,” Bernstein said.

While Yurovsky, Minor and 

Najarian didn’t cruise past their 
opponents, they were able to find 
the right gear at just the right 
time.

Wolverines shine in front 
of Leone, Hahn, Connors

By AVI SHOLKOFF 

Daily Sports Writer

Michigan women’s gymnastics 

coach Bev Plocki believes there 
are two core aspects central to the 
collegiate athletic experience: 

“One part of it is winning 

championships, being on a team 
and learning about teamwork,” 
Plocki said. “The other part of it 
is learning to be humble, learning 
that it isn’t always all about us.”

While 
the 
top-ranked 

Wolverines are well on their 
way to fulfilling Plocki’s first 
core aspect, Plocki’s second core 
aspect made itself apparent this 
weekend in Michigan’s meet 
against Ohio State (1-0-1 Big Ten, 
1-0-1 overall). Michigan learned 
firsthand about appreciation and 
gained insight into the experience 
of living with autism.

Saturday, the Wolverines (1-0-

0, 3-0-0), defeated the Buckeyes, 
196.950-195.275, 
in 
front 
of 

Abby Hahn and John Leone, 
two individuals on the autism 
spectrum who have both spent 
significant time with members of 
the gymnastics team.

Hahn performed a magnificent 

floor routine before the meet 
began, and the crowd graciously 
applauded. After Hahn’s routine, 
Brian Connors, another individual 
with autism, sang a roaring 
national anthem, which was also 

met with cheers of approval.

The meet offered freshman 

Olivia Karas, as well as her 
teammates, a unique opportunity 
to bring familiarity to the public 
about the disorder.

“It was awesome to compete 

for something bigger than just 
Michigan, for a greater cause,” 
Karas said. “(It was) a great honor 
having the (autism) symbol on our 
cheeks.”

Karas 
lived 
up 
to 
her 

expectations. She finished with 
the highest all-around score in the 
meet and also set a career high in 
the uneven bars, achieving a score 
of 9.850.

John Leone, a college student 

at 
University 
of 
Michigan-

Dearborn, has spent many hours 
in the gym with the Michigan 
team over the years, growing in 
comfort after each visit. Because 
of the amount of time he has 
spent with the Wolverines in the 
gym, the older members of the 
team have established an ongoing 
relationship with him. 

Junior Nicole Artz, in her third 

year of taking part in Autism 
Awareness Meet, praised Leone 
and his influence on the team.

“(Leone’s) 
been 
a 
true 

inspiration and a really good 
friend to us,” Artz said. “(He is) a 
number-one Michigan supporter, 
(he) cares so much about us, and 
we love him as well.”

Artz also thrived in the meet, 

garnering the second best all-
around score and earning the 
top score in the floor event with 
a 9.900. She also tied her season 
bests in both the vault and the 
balance beam.

Many 
individuals 
on 
the 

autism spectrum had prominent 
roles in Saturday’s meet, perhaps 
highlighting 
Plocki’s 
message 

that individuals with the disorder 
enjoy participating in the same 
activities as those without it.

“We want people to learn from 

what we’ve learned and from our 
experiences,” Plocki said. “When 
we can have Abby come out and 
demonstrate her ability or Brian 
come out and sing like he sang, 
(it is) hopefully changing ideas 
or perceptions of the people who 
were here at this meet.”

Plocki shared one final story 

about Leone and his experiences 
in Michigan’s team huddle after 
each practice.

“We put him with (the) girls 

around him, close to him and 
touching him to do a ‘Let’s Go 
Blue,’ ” Plocki said. “After that, he 
immediately ran back over to his 
mother, and he was like, ‘I did it! 
I did it!’ ”

On a day when the Wolverines 

showed why they are the No.1 
team in the nation, it was 
ultimately their humility and 
appreciation that stood out.

Wolverines prepare for Minnesota

By SIMON KAUFMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Two weeks ago, when the 

Michigan men’s basketball team 
looked at its schedule, it held its 
breath. It was 
readying for a 
daunting three-
game 
stretch 

of top-25 talent 
featuring then-
No. 20 Purdue 
on 
the 
road, 

then-No. 
3 

Maryland 
at 

home and then-
No. 16 Iowa in 
Iowa City. The 
Wolverines 
came out with 
only one win 
— 
upsetting 

the Terrapins — but also put up a 
good showing against a stronger 
Hawkeyes team.

This week, as Michigan (3-2 

Big Ten, 13-5 overall) looks ahead, 
it can breathe a small sigh of 
relief. The menu for the next 10 
days includes a helping of the Big 
Ten’s bottom feeders, starting 
with Minnesota (0-6, 6-12) on 
Wednesday night at Crisler Center 
and ending with Penn State (2-4, 
11-8) in a neutral-site game at 
Madison Square Garden in New 
York on Jan. 30. Sandwiched in 
between is a trip to Lincoln to take 
on Nebraska (3-3, 11-8) and a home 
bout against Rutgers (0-6, 6-13).

To simplify the difference 

between the last two weeks and 
the next two weeks: Michigan’s 
past three opponents have totaled 
46 wins this season; it’s next four 
have combined for 34.

The slate of lesser opponents 

offers the Wolverines a chance to 
bounce back from a challenging 
stretch. But, of course, don’t 
tell that to Michigan coach 
John Beilein, who is as likely to 
discount an upcoming opponent 
as Rick’s is to let you skip the line 
when it’s not your birthday.

“Still no must wins, you know 

that — not this time of the year,” 

Beilein said of the upcoming slate 
of games. “But yeah, this is the 
way you got to look at it always: 
every home game. You saw how 
difficult it is to win on the road. 
You know that; we all know that. 
… (Our game against Minnesota 
is) an opportunity to win at home 
against a team that’s scrappy, 
that’s feisty.”

Despite that scrappiness and 

feistiness, Minnesota has little to 
show for it. The Golden Gophers 
are still looking for their first 
conference win and are riding 
a seven-game losing streak into 
Ann Arbor, looking for their fist 
win since Dec. 16.

Statistically, it’s easy to see why 

Minnesota is in the gutter. The 
Gophers’ 41.2 shooting percentage 
ranks last in the Big Ten, and their 
77.3 points allowed per game is the 
second highest in the conference.

In his third year at the helm, 

Minnesota coach Richard Pitino 
has struggled to find the same 
success as he did in his first 
season, when he led the Gophers 
to a 2013-14 NIT title. Since taking 

over, he has lost nine players to 
graduation, and his roster this 
year is underclassman-heavy. The 
past two contests, Minnesota’s 
starting five has featured three 
freshmen and two sophomores.

One of those sophomores, 

guard Nate Mason, leads the 
team in minutes and is pacing 12.3 
points per game. He’s one of four 
Gophers averaging double-digit 
scoring. Forward Joey King (12.9, 
3.4, 1.6) has been one of Pitino’s 
first options off the bench in the 
last two games, and Minnesota 
has also gotten contributions from 
guard Carlos Morris (10.8, 3.9, 
1.4) and forward Jordan Murphy 
(10.5, 8.1, 0.5).

After 
getting 
mauled 
by 

Nebraska last week, Minnesota 
hung with an Indiana team 
Saturday that is undefeated in 
the Big Ten, though the Golden 
Gophers ultimately came up short.

On Michigan’s side, Beilein all 

but confirmed that it would be 
without senior guard Caris LeVert 
for the fifth straight game as he 
continues to recover from a left-

foot injury.

“We continue to get encouraging 

news about Caris,” Beilein said. 
“He’s doing more and more right 
now on and off the court. We 
expect (more work) on and off 
the court going forward. We have 
no date yet, and we’ll see how he 
tolerates any pain going forward.”

Michigan might miss LeVert’s 

on-court leadership the most. 
In its two most recent losses to 
Purdue and Iowa, it was able 
to fight back, but never able to 
completely close the gap, allowing 
the Boilermakers and Hawkeyes 
to go on late runs.

“We talk about losses that we 

have had this year, there’s always 
been that four-minute stretch in 
the first half or the second half we 
just fell apart,” said junior forward 
Zak Irvin. “We just got to stay 
together as a team. We can’t have 
mental lapses. (Against Iowa) we 
had one in the beginning of the 
game which hurt us, and then we 
had one late in the second half also. 
We got to stay strong mentally and 
just come together as a team.”

‘M’ selects trio of 
captains for 2016

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Editor

After missing two straight 

NCAA 
Tournaments, 
the 

Michigan women’s soccer team 
will need to do everything in its 
power to break the trend next 
season.

Tuesday 
afternoon, 
that 

campaign began with the naming 
of three captains for the 2016-17 
season: junior forward Madisson 
Lewis, junior midfielder Jessica 
Heifetz and redshirt sophomore 
forward Ani Sarkisian.

“Jess, Madi and Ani will make 

a great trio of captains to lead our 
2016 team,” said Michigan coach 
Greg Ryan in a statement. “Spread 
evenly throughout the pitch, with 
Jess in the midfield, Madi on the 
back line and Ani up top, we will 
have a great leader in each area of 
the field.

“These three captains are 

supported by an outstanding 
senior class. We view the whole 
class as a leadership team, and 
we are enjoying the meetings we 
are having as we create a shared 
vision for our 2016 team.”

Former 
captains 
Maddie 

Clarfield, Corinne Harris and 
Christina Murillo now hand 
over the reigns to another trio 
composed of three players who 
have each had vastly different 
experiences as Wolverines.

During 
their 
freshman 

seasons, both Lewis and Heifetz 
were part of the Michigan squad 
that reached the 2013 Elite Eight. 
Heifetz saw almost no action 
that season, though, and played 
in only one game — against 
Oakland.

Lewis, on the other hand, was 

one of the team’s difference-
makers on the frontline that 
year and rarely played like a 
freshman — a statement often 
backed by Ryan. After Michigan’s 
NCAA Tournament first-round 

win against Milwaukee, he even 
compared Lewis to being “faster 
than a rocket ship” to describe 
her ability to quickly break any 
opponents’ backline and find a 
scoring lane.

After ending the season ranked 

second on the team in goals (six), 
assists (nine) and points (21), 
Lewis was a unanimous selection 
for the All-Big Ten Freshman 
team. Since coming to Michigan, 
she hasn’t missed a game.

The 
next 
season 
was 
a 

turnaround 
for 
both 
future 

captains, as Lewis played more 
minutes as a defensive back 
and still notched five goals, and 
Heifetz went from playing only 
one game to 18 while adding three 
goals as well.

Though the Wolverines’ season 

was short-lived that year, it 
marked the arrival of Sarkisian, a 
Florida State transfer who missed 
the 2013 season due to injury.

Returning from an injury was 

no problem for Sarkisian, who 
has started every regular-season 
game since donning the maize and 
blue. She hasn’t skipped a beat, 
finishing last season with seven 
goals, three assists and 17 points 
— tying all three categories for 
first on the team with sophomore 
forward Taylor Timko.

“All three captains have been 

key impact players on our team 
since arriving at Michigan,” Ryan 
said. “They have the complete 
respect of our coaching staff and 
of their teammates for how they 
carry themselves on and off the 
field.”

Michigan will soon begin 

its strength and conditioning 
regimen 
in 
addition 
to 
a 

competitive spring season, but 
the Wolverines will have to wait 
until August to see meaningful 
results. The election of Lewis, 
Heifetz and Sarkisian is a start, 
though, and it might just be 
Michigan’s antidote. 

WOMEN’S SOCCER

Martin, Dancs suspended

By JUSTIN MEYER

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Big 
Ten 
announced 

Tuesday 
that 
Michigan 

sophomore 
forward 
Dexter 

Dancs 
and 
sophomore 

defenseman Cutler Martin would 
be suspended following an on ice 
brawl involving the two after 
Sunday night’s contest against 
Ohio State.

The 
announcement 
was 

expected — Michigan’s pair of 
disqualification penalties each 
automatically carry a one-game 
punishment — but each player 
earned extra-game suspensions. 
In addition to serving conference 
suspensions, neither player will 
be permitted to suit up for the 
exhibition matchup against the 
United States National Talent 
Development Team on Thursday.

“I think our players have to 

take some responsibility for (the 
suspensions),” 
said 
Michigan 

coach Red Berenson. “Our team 
doesn’t condone that. We don’t 
teach that. We expect players to 
play with emotion, but to play 
with discipline. When the whistle 
goes or the horn goes, the game 
is over. I can’t speak for the other 
team, but that’s not how we play. 
I’m disappointed, but if we got 
suspended, then we deserve it.”

Martin, who will sit out two 

conference games, made waves on 
the internet over the weekend as 
a highlight circulated of his hard 
right punch landing square on a 

Buckeye facemask.

Dancs will sit only one Big Ten 

game for retaliating with a high 
cross-check. It appeared that Ohio 
State’s Dakota Joshua instigated 
the extracurricular activity when 
he hit Dancs with the butt end of 
his stick after the final whistle.

The Buckeyes had two players 

suspended for the minimum of 
one game.

“I don’t think it was brewing, 

it just exploded at the end,” 
Berenson said. “Obviously, their 
team was frustrated, and our 
team has to understand that.”

Dancs plays left wing on the 

fourth line for the Wolverines. 
He has suited up for 19 games this 
year, recording five goals and five 
assists on 20 shots.

Martin has started 20 games, 

recently taking the ice alongside 
freshman defenseman Nicholas 
Boka. Martin has eight points and 
leads the team in blocked shots 
with 39.

The Big Ten elected not to tack 

on any additional suspension for 
junior forward Alex Kile, who 
was penalized for leaving the 
bench.

In an official press release, the 

conference said:

“Following a review of the 

incident by the conference, the 
Big 
Ten 
imposed 
additional 

suspensions and issued public 
reprimands of Michigan’s Dancs 
and Martin for violating the Big 
Ten Sportsmanship Policy.”

The fight catapulted the rivalry 

matchup into larger news circles, 
but Berenson was unwavering in 
his view.

“You win the game on the 

scoreboard, you’re not going to 
win it after the game is over,” 
Berenson said. “We made it clear 
to our team that we don’t want 
to be a highly penalized team. 
We don’t want to be a team that 
retaliates. We’re not a team that 
takes cheap shots. We don’t 
recruit players that we think are 
going to help us run the other 
team out of the building. We don’t 
play like that.

“It’s not good for college 

hockey. It’s not good for the Big 
Ten. It’s not good for Michigan.”

Michigan has a clear option for 

replacing Martin in sophomore 
defenseman Sam Piazza. The 
Chicago-area native has cracked 
the lineup several times since 
the 
Great 
Lakes 
Invitational 

tournament.

Meanwhile, Dancs will be 

replaced by either sophomore 
Niko Porikos or junior Evan Allen.

However, 
the 
potential 

absence 
of 
Zach 
Werenski 

from Thursday’s lineup — the 
sophomore defender did not 
practice due to “bruising” — 
leaves the Wolverines in a tight 
spot. Kevin Lohan is still out 
with a back injury, and it is 
likely that Michigan will have 
to dress every available player 
on its 22-man roster if Werenski 
is not ready to go for the NTDP 
exhibition game.

Barnes Arico, Wolverines 
get much-needed day off

Michigan takes 
advantage of rare 

break to rest

bodies and minds

By BRAD WHIPPLE

Daily Sports Editor

Monday morning, Kim Barnes 

Arico dunked a basketball.

No, the Michigan women’s 

basketball coach wasn’t on the 
floor of Crisler Center. Nor was 
anybody else. The Wolverines 
never have Monday practice, but 
Barnes Arico told her staff and 
players not to show up for any 
reason whatsoever.

With Martin Luther King 

Jr. Day, Monday came with the 
added benefit of no class, so the 
Wolverines truly had a day off. 
Having played five games in 
the last two weeks, they need 
all the rest they can get ahead 
of a grueling Big Ten stretch — 
starting with No. 7 Ohio State on 
Thursday.

As for Barnes Arico, she 

could’ve 
spent 
her 
morning 

doing the usual: watching film, 
preparing for the next game, etc. 
Instead, she asked her kids what 
they would want to do if she had 
a day off.

Next thing she knew, she was 

at Sky Zone Trampoline Park 
in Canton, Mich. With a ball in 
her hand, she flew toward the 
basket and dunked. And yes, of 
course she got the whole thing on 
camera.

“I was just gonna watch 

(my kids) and maybe do some 
work on the e-mail, bring my 
computer and watch some film,” 
Barnes Arico said in her weekly 
radio show. “And they said, 
‘Mommy why don’t you come 
out?’ So I paid, and I joined the 
fun.”

The fun didn’t end there. With 

her mother visiting town, Barnes 
Arico took her out to lunch for 
Ann Arbor Restaurant Week. 

Once all was said and done, 
though, Barnes Arico returned 
home to start preparing for the 
Buckeyes. 

As for her players, Monday 

was probably the most rest 
they’ve had all season. This is 
the Wolverines’ first season that 
games consistently fall on both 
Thursday and Sunday, which has 
led to the same weekly routine: 
game Thursday, practice Friday, 
travel Saturday, game Sunday, 
class Monday.

Yes, it’s as exhausting as it 

sounds.

“Our players haven’t had a 

true day off,” Barnes Arico said. 
“I don’t know if we’re gonna get 
another one for a really long time 
— and we haven’t had one for a 
long time.

“Sometimes less is more. They 

need to be reminded this point in 
the season to make sure they’re 
resting both their minds and their 
bodies.”

Last season, the Wolverines 

had eight games on Monday, 
Tuesday or Wednesday. This 
year, that number is down to four. 
Michigan players have lost their 
weekends, and having to rest their 
legs on Mondays with no practice 
doesn’t mean they can just skip 
class.

According to Barnes Arico, she 

would prefer her team to have 
more full days off. Regardless, 
she has worked around the jam-
packed schedule to the best of her 
ability.

“This is the first year that we’ve 

had to do it like that,” Barnes Arico 
said. “I don’t particularly love it, 
because of the weekend aspect, 
but I do think there is something 
to be said for the routine. I think it 
makes the kids feel comfortable — 
they know what they have every 
week, they’re set.”

The schedule has also taken 

a toll on the coaching staff. One 
of 
Barnes 
Arico’s 
assistants 

hadn’t been home for the last 
four weekends, and that didn’t go 
unnoticed by the head coach.

“I could tell she’s wearing it 

a little bit on her face,” Barnes 
Arico said. “I said, ‘You know 
what, you need to get out of this 
office a couple days, and you 
need to go home and spend some 
time with your family. You being 
here an extra hour is not gonna 
make the difference between us 
winning or losing this basketball 
game.’

“I think it’s important for us to 

remember to tell the people we’re 
surrounded by that it’s important 
to do that — whether that’s our 
players or staff. We will get more 
in return.”

Of late, the Wolverines have 

been getting more in return. 
They’ve won three of their last 
four games, all of which have been 
decided by an average of nine 
points. Michigan dropped a close 
game against No. 8 Maryland 
last Thursday, but it was the 
Wolverines’ only loss in the two 
weeks following a three-game 
losing streak.

As 
for 
Michigan’s 
recent 

success, it completed a 17-point 
comeback against Iowa and held 
on down the stretch against 
Minnesota on the road.

Most 
importantly, 
the 

Wolverines 
changed 
the 

storyline against Penn State. 
In 2013 and 2014, Michigan 
had been the Nittany Lions’ 
third-to-last and final game, 
respectively. 
Both 
times, 

Penn State earned a win to 
clinch its share of the Big Ten 
Championship. 
Both 
times, 

Michigan players hung their 
heads as confetti rained from 
the ceiling and fans stormed 
the court. Thursday, though, 
Barnes Arico helped eliminate 
the pit in her stomach as her 
team pulled off its first win 
in Happy Valley since 2001 — 
evening out its Big Ten record 
at 3-3. 

And if that’s what Michigan 

can do while battling great 
fatigue, there’s no telling what it 
could do on Thursday, against a 
ranked Ohio State squad with a 
full day off.

The Legend of Mike

M

ike walked into his boss Mike’s office.

“Sit down,” Mike, Mike’s boss, said to Mike.
Mike sat down.

“Mike,” said Mike, “you’ve been having a rough couple of weeks here. Your produc-

tivity’s way down.”

“Sorry, Mike,” said Mike. “Things with Mike have been rough lately--”
“Oh!” said Mike’s boss Mike, clapping his hands. “I’m so glad you and Mike finally 

got together! We were all rooting for you two.”

“What?” said Mike, employee of Mike. “Oh, you mean...no, not Mike from the office. 

Mike, my boyfriend.”

“Oh,” said Mike, slumping a little in his chair. “Well, anyway, Mike…”
“Yes, Mike?” inquired Mike, employee of Mike, coworker of Mike and boyfriend of 

Mike.

“You can’t let your personal life interfere with your work anymore, Mike.”
“I completely understand, Mike.”
“Take a few days off. Take care of your problems with Mike.”
“Sounds good. Thanks, Mike.”
“Anytime. Now get out of my office, Mike.”
“This is my office, Mike.”
“Wha...oh, cause we’re both named Mike?”
“That’s right, Mike.”
“Ha. Good one. You’re pretty funny, Mike.”
“Thanks, Mike.”

***

“What the fuck is your problem, Mike?!” shouted Mike, Mike’s boyfriend. He bolt-

ed into the kitchen of Mike and Mike’s shared apartment, keeping his back to Mike.

“Nothing!” shouted Mike, boyfriend of Mike. “What’s your problem, Mike?”
“That night last weekend, after we got back from the club…”
“That was a fucking week ago!” shouted Mike.
“Don’t yell at me, Mike!” yelled Mike. Mike recoiled in shock. “Sorry,” said Mike 

sheepishly. “You know I hate it when you yell at me.”

“Sorry, Mike,” said Mike. “I’m just...I dunno, frustrated! I feel like you’re accusing 

me.”

“You know what you did, Mike,” Mike said firmly. “We were having sex, and when 

you climaxed you yelled ‘Mike.’”

Mike stood confused for a minute, before finally speaking. “So...what’s the prob-

lem?”

“You didn’t mean me!” shouted Mike, his eyes brimming with tears.
“What?! Of course I meant you! What are you talking about?!”
“I could tell by the way you extended the ‘i’ sound,” said Mike. “You were totally 

thinking about your coworker Mike when we were having sex, weren’t you, Mike?”

“Absolutely not!”
“I don’t believe you, Mike.”
“Trust me, Mike!” said Mike, struggling to keep himself from yelling. “Look, I know 

it’s hard, being a couple of Mikes in a world where everyone seems to be named Mike. 
But you can’t let that get to your head, Mike! You’re the only Mike for me, Mike.”

Mike looked up at Mike. “You promise, Mike?”
“I promise, Mike.”
Mike and Mike embraced. After a while, Mike felt the completely annoying need to 

fill the tender moment of silence with humor, and said: “I can’t wait to tell Mike about 
this.”

“Mike!”
“Just kidding, Mike!”
“Oh! Haha. You’re pretty funny, Mike.”
“Thanks, Mike.”
They embraced for a few more seconds, and then Mike looked up at Mike with a 

confused look on his face. “Mike, your boss?”

“No, Mike. Mike, my coworker. Why would I tell Mike, my boss?”
“Oh. Yeah, I guess that would be pretty unprofessional, Mike.”
“It certainly would, Mike.”

THE statement

I’ve always been the silent type.
My mom once told me that she was in constant anxiety while she was preg-

nant with me because, unlike most fetuses, I didn’t move or kick. Things got so 
bad, she said, that she had tearfully gone to the doctor to find out if anything 
was wrong.

“Nothing was wrong,” she would then say. “It was just that you were too 

quiet, like you still are now.” I’d just stare at her whenever she said this, unable 
to think of an appropriate response.

Growing up, I had the same dilemma. In my preschool, while other people 

would play pretend games and tag during recess, I’d sit in a corner and play 
with sticks or little pieces of plastic I’d find.

My mom has still kept my preschool report card where, in between the rain-

bow stickers and purple smiley faces, my teachers commented, “While Tanya 
is doing well with recognizing colors and shading, she is very quiet and does 
not interact with other children.”

Scientists wanted to do tests on me to find out what was wrong, my mother 

still says, but I’m going to take that with a grain of salt.

I don’t want to say that I was a “precocious child,” because that really wasn’t 

the case. I never showed any signs of being exceedingly mature or intelligent 
for my age. In reality, I was just an extremely awkward person who had no idea 
what to say or do. I was painfully shy and hyperconscious about that fact.

This is something my family took a long time to understand.
The concepts of “nervous” and “shy” don’t exist among the kids in my family, 

and much of that has to do with the city that most of us grew up in. Living in 
Bombay breeds a sharp tongue and an acute sense of street smarts.

My parents, all my aunts and uncles and several of my cousins are products 

of Bombay’s upbringing. My five-year-old baby cousin, who currently resides 
in the city, has a biting vocabulary, speaks five different languages — English, 
Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi and Marwari — with a hostile intensity and looks 
like she’s always ready to pick a fistfight.

But somehow, the inheritance of this Bombay personality skipped me, 

despite having grown up there for the first six years of my life. So, instead of 
being brazen and self-assured like the rest of my family, I’m timid and self-
conscious.

Furthermore, Indians in India grow up in joint families — your grandpar-

ents, aunts, uncles and cousins all live with you under one roof. There’s no 
room to feel awkward and uncomfortable. Wanting to be left alone was never 
an option and often frowned upon.

As I’ve grown up, my introverted personality has taken the form of a seem-

ingly cold and aloof demeanor, especially with strangers, when really I’m still 
the same awkward and anxious preschool girl at recess — confused about who 
to play with, how to talk to people and what to say.

Daily Arts Writer

 

Editor’s Note: While some communities prefer disability first-

language (“disabled person”), others prefer person first-language 
(person with disabilities). Terminology in this article is adapted to specific 
communities’s preferences. When referring to disabilities in general, the person 
first-language and disability first-language are used interchangeably.

There’s a reason why Michigan refers to its second term as winter semester instead 

of spring, unlike most other colleges in the nation. From the New Year to the beginning 
of April, the roads and sidewalks of the city and on campus are both often obstructed with 
unplowed snow and unsalted ice.

Navigating the 780-square acre campus by foot is already difficult enough for the able-bodied 

individual. For physically disabled students, or 5.7 percent of the student body, the neglect to shovel 
makes ramps slick, entries circuitous and commutes more dangerous.

As I trudged 20 minutes from my home on South Campus to the Services for Students with Disabilities 

(SSD) office in Haven Hall, I was already in a position of privilege with a body I take for granted.

I sat down with SSD Director Dr. Stuart Segal, who also received his clinical psychology doctorate at the Univer-

sity about 40 years ago. 

SSD’s primary mission is to fulfill academic accommodations meant to mitigate discrimination of disabilities in the 

classroom. Equity is the goal.

“Extended time is our number one accommodation,” Segal explained. “This is an incredibly competitive school. By 

allowing (disabled students) to demonstrate what they know, the idea is that we’re leveling the playing field.”

In his 23 years coordinating the program, Segal proudly said SSD successfully advocated for 63,000 accommodations 

last year — from extended time to interpreters for the deaf to special wheelchair access. Not a single one was denied. 

The catch is, though, that students must register and request these accommodations themselves. This raises issues of 

self-identification, stigma and awareness.

Segal summed it up: “(Disabilities are) an area of progress — just not as much progress as we’d like to see.”

 The ADA:

The Americans with Disabilities Act celebrated its 25-year 

anniversary last July. The bill, enacted by the U.S. Congress 
under President George H. W. Bush in 1990 and amended by 
George W. Bush in 2009, protects individuals with medical 
conditions — mental and physical, temporary and chronic, 
severe and mild — against discrimination. The law universally 
requires employers and institutions, including schools, to pro-
vide public accommodations for disabled people.

Currently, the University is interviewing new candidates 

for its ADA coordinator position, as current director Carole 
Dubritsky will retire after the winter semester.

“The Americans with Disabilities Act has been a wonderful 

way of opening the University to many more people,” said Prof. 
Petra Kuppers. “But at the same time, the ADA is constantly 
undercut; it’s constantly being taken back or not being enforced 
in appropriate ways by local council.”

Kuppers, who operates in a wheelchair, chairs the Univer-

sity’s disability studies program, a field that didn’t exist when 
she began her higher education around 20 years ago.

After a decade at the University, she said the University was 

doing an OK job being ADA accessible.

“I might be able to get everywhere, but I might have a very 

complicated route,” Kuppers noted.

 The bare minimum:

 As a large public institution, the University definitely feels 

greater pressure to enforce ADA requirements, though often at 

the most minimal staffing level.

According to the 2014-2015 SSD Annual Report, the Univer-

sity admitted 727 new students with disabilities last year — an 
increase of almost 10 percent from the year prior, as well as a 
record high in SSD’s 41-year history. The current total of 2,474 
students registered with SSD has more than doubled over the 
past five years.

This increase of student diversity is tremendous progress. In 

fact, compared to all 15 schools in the Big Ten and CIC (Council 
for Independent Colleges), Michigan serves the most students 
with disabilities. Yet, of the 15, Michigan also employs the least 
number of specialist faculty members, a disappointing total 
of seven — just under the legal staff minimum for disabilities 
offices.

In short, the University has the least number of people to 

help the largest group of people who need the help.

 Why is this? Simply an issue of timing:

Segal speculated that in the past, Big 10 colleges with lower 

admissions criteria housed the larger disabilities offices. For 
example, the Ohio State University’s open admissions policy, 
which they no longer implement, attracted and amassed more 
disabled students earlier than Michigan did.

 Now though, OSU’s disabled student body comprises 3.1 

percent of their total student population, 2.6 percent less than 
disabled enrollment on Michigan’s campus. Nevertheless, 
even with fewer students, OSU has developed its resources for 
decades longer than the University.

“Historically, as a lot more students with disabilities were 

going into these other less exclusive schools — Michigan State, 
Wisconsin, Minnesota — it was during an economic time (the 
’80s and the ’90s) where there was more money to put resourc-
es toward (disabilities offices),” Segal explained.

The surge in Michigan’s SSD student enrollment necessitat-

ed new developments only over the past five years. Since then, 
disability registration has doubled as the SSD budget has been 
nearly halved. From $32,000 eight years ago, the SSD now must 
operate on $18,000.

While budget cuts do not in any way affect ADA accommo-

dation requests (the office for student life and the Provost’s 
office cover all extra costs to uphold the law), they do hinder 
SSD’s outreach potential.

“I believe there are still many more students out there who 

should be registered, but they don’t know we exist,” Segal said, 
citing the restriction of outreach as SSD’s predominant prob-
lem.

His solution: “We can do a better job frontloading. Students 

and parents need to know from the very beginning that we’re 
here.”

Simple, right? Unfortunately, consistent funding cuts are 

what limit solutions like frontloading.

“(Monetarily), when I have to make a decision between an 

accommodation and a program for awareness, well, it’s the pro-
gram for awareness that’s not going to happen.”

And we’re back where we began.

Navigating campus with physical disabilities:

 Retrofitting campus buildings:

 During her 12-year presidency, completed in 2014, Mary 

Sue Coleman helmed over 1,830 projects affecting 313 campus 
buildings, a tab of just under $5 billion. Her Residential Life 
Initiative alone cost the University $626 million.

Positively, renovations such as East Quad and North Quad 

have modernized the historic dorms to be more accessible than 
ever before. On the other hand, buildings constructed prior to 
the ADA’s passage rarely considered codes of accessibility, and 
they still dot the campus.

West Quad, originally erected in 1937, had serious accessibil-

ity issues long before its $114.5 million renovation, finished this 
past fall.

“The University probably could’ve done something about it 

at the cost of several million dollars,” Segal admitted. “But A: 
was there several million dollars to give to such a project? And 
B: given that the master plan was to rehab the building in a few 
years, it didn’t make sense to do something that would be natu-
rally done in the course of the rehab.”

For the Hatcher Graduate Library, last reconstructed in 

1920, the iron-ground foundation is especially difficult to ret-
rofit. English prof. Melanie Yergeau, who specializes in digital 
disabilities communities, called this a “design apartheid.”

“In (retrofitting buildings), accessibility is seen as aestheti-

cally this ugly kind of thing, so ramps and accessible entrances 
tend to be cloistered toward the back or side,” Yergeau said. 
“Then, the elevator might be all the way down the hall, then 
once you get up there, you have to navigate these labyrinth-ian 
hallways to get where you need.”

Ironically, her own office is tucked away in a closed corridor 

of the English department, where the lack of a handicap but-
ton requires one to circle around the narrow halls to the other 
side’s entrance.

Social alienation:

Issues with physical access create social impediment, as 

well. Prof. Kuppers cited the irony behind University-spon-
sored events and conferences at inaccessible venues, such as 
Sava’s restaurant where the handicap bathroom is blocked, and 
The Espresso Bar, on Literati’s second floor with no elevator.

“Can you imagine being a student and you can’t do the hang-

out side of things?” Kuppers said. “It’s not just about the thing 
being accessible, but it’s about being socially and culturally 
connected, and that’s really hard to do if some of the support 
structures are not accessible.”

Navigating campus with mental disabilities:

Mental disabilities encompass anything related to the brain, 

including learning, psychiatric, intellectual and developmental 
impairments. Examples range from autism to attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder — as well as mental health conditions, 
such as depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, and 
chronic illnesses, such as Crohn’s disease or multiple sclerosis.

“A big part of the problem is that students come in and don’t 

realize that mental health issues are technically considered a 
disability which are all protected under the ADA,” Segal said.

Invisible disabilities:

Physical disabilities (such as visual, auditory or mobility 

disabilities) comprise only seven percent of all SSD registered 
students and are almost always visually apparent, whereas 
‘invisible disabilities’ make up more than 80 percent. Learning 
disabilities are the most commonly registered across campus, 
followed by mental health and chronic health conditions. The 
most prevalent among learning differences include ADHD and 
autism spectrum disorder/Aspergers.

Yergeau personally identifies on the autistic spectrum, but 

she noted, “nobody would know that unless they Googled me 
… Sometimes people can pass; (disability) is a huge part of 
their lives, but it’s not always the part of life that people readily 
notice.”

Stigma:

College campuses — essentially, pools of highly intellectual 

individuals — are especially difficult climates to disclose any 
type of disability, especially invisible ones.

“This problem of stigma is not unique to Michigan. I just 

think people really keenly feel it here because it’s a really pres-
tigious university, so to say that you have a disability, it makes 
you very vulnerable,” Yergeau said.

As a consequence, many students neglect to request accom-

modations even though they need them.

Ignorance:

For disabled individuals, the problem of ignorance sur-

rounds lack of awareness to SSD’s existence and the accom-
modations available. For nondisabled students, ignorance often 
causes well-intentioned charity groups whose missions run 
counter to the disabled people they serve.

For example, the autistic community has long struggled to 

boycott Autism Speaks, arguing that the organization, while 
seemingly well meaning, actually promotes the eradication of 
autistic people and suggests backwards cures. Both the foun-
dation and its college chapters don’t include any autistic voices 
either.

Yergeau understands how hurtful the group can be on cam-

puses, but she said the well-meaning students simply don’t rec-
ognize the true motives of the organization.

“I’d like to see people being more open to conversation,” she 

suggested as a potential solution. “Autistic people constitute 
1 to 2 percent of this campus … (so it’s important to) defer to 
autistic students, staff, faculty in conversations pertaining to 
autism.”

The solution?

 Finding community:

Segal, Kuppers and Yergeau all mentioned community as a 

way to mitigate ignorance and galvanize advocacy. One glance 
at Kuppers’s cluttered bulletin board demonstrates how vibrant 
the disabilities community really is. Each October marks a 
month of disability workshops and panels where both disabled 
and able-bodied students may join the conversation. Upcoming 
events include a wheelchair basketball game at Crisler Center; 
the Disability Culture Salon visual arts showcase in late Janu-
ary; Crip Futurities conference in early February — and too 
many more events to note. Later this semester, SSD will host its 
41st Anniversary All-Day Conference.

“Often, when people talk about disabilities, it’s always either 

how do fix them or fix the problem medically,” Yergeau said. 
“Even accommodations can have that kind of focus.”

Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) and the 

Active Minds student group certainly offer numerous support 
services for mental health, but students who newly develop 
conditions like depression during college have varying comfort 
levels with treatment.

“It’s hard to think about (community) in terms of depres-

sion because often people’s experiences are so overwhelmingly 
bad,” Yergeau said, “but I think that people do want to be in 
community with people who are having the same experiences 
and not always in the context of a support or therapy group.”

Another integral community is The University of Michigan 

Initiative on Disability Studies. UMInDs began as an inter-
disciplinary collaborative between grad students and staff, of 
which Prof. Tobin Siebers, who passed away last year, devot-
edly chaired. Funded by LSA, Rackham Graduate School and 
the offices of the Provost and Vice President for Research, 
UMInDS offers formal graduate-level classes as well as work-
shops and seminars.

“UMInDs is more culturally focused,” Yergeau said, address-

ing how UMInDs veers away from medical perspectives of dis-
ability. “What does it mean to have a disability culture? How do 
we generate a network of support? Thinking about diversity on 
campus socially, narratively.”

Disability as Diversity:

At a leadership breakfast last February, University Presi-

dent Mark Schlissel launched a campus-wide conversation to 
improve diversity — an initiative he would continually update 
throughout 2015. Major themes in his strategic diversity plan 
included creating scholarships to increase economic diversity 
and aiming to hire more racial minority staff to boost ethnic 
diversity. The disabled community wasn’t specifically encom-
passed in diversity.

Anna Schnitzner, the coordinator of the Council for Disabil-

ity Concerns and the disability issues informationist at Taub-
man Health Sciences Library, has worked on campus since 
the ’60s. She hopes to see disabilities further integrated into 
Schlissel’s “ground-breaking” campaign.

“Before, disability was not recognized under the umbrella of 

diversity along with race and gender and sexual orientation,” 
she recalled from her half a century on campus. “We have not 
concentrated on real diversity — for everybody. And what could 
be more diverse than disability?”

Yergeau agreed. “When people encounter disability, espe-

cially something like learning disability, the tendency is to 
think ‘I don’t know if this student can make it here’ rather than 
to think ‘wow, this will add such a great dimension’ to diver-
sity,” she said.

In addition to growth in disabled student counts, interview-

ees indicated the need for neurodiversity among staff, such as 
Yergeau and Kuppers, as well.

“I would love to have more faculty with disabilities, but at the 

same time I would love to have more support systems in place 
to ensure that they can succeed in this environment,” Kuppers 
said. “They include thinking about access but also adjusting.”

Ultimately, progress is slow and often frustrating, but prog-

ress is evident. Progress is possible.

Personal Statement: The First Days

W

e’ve all experienced it — the 
nervousness and constant self-
deliberation. Do I sit next to 

that cute girl or boy in lecture? Do I intro-
duce myself before the professor begins 
her spiel or after? Should I gel my hair on 
the first day? Jeans or sweatpants? These 
are the constant questions that many 
college students (including myself) ask 
themselves before the first day of classes.

I, however, must also deal with a dif-

ferent anxiety — I stutter. And while it’s 
not a major barrier in my speaking skills, 
whenever I find myself nervous, I stutter 
significantly more. It’s just a fact that I’ve 
noticed, and there’s little I can do to stop 
it. It’s unfortunate, and I hate it.

In high school it was easier, because I 

generally had classes with the same kids. 
Thus, I felt comfortable speaking in class 
and seldom worried about participat-
ing in discussions. In college, however, it 
has proven more challenging. Each of my 
courses comes with a new set of peers to 
learn and engage with. As a result, the 
first days of class are the most difficult for 
me. Not only am I forced to decide where 
to sit and who to sit next to, but I am also 
determined not to stutter.

Though I try my best to not let my 

stutter define my identity and actions, I 
know that it will 
always be a part 
of me. During 
my years in high 
school, I spoke 
in front of the 
entire 
student 

body and broad-
casted 
sports 

games 
online. 

Why, then, do 
these first days 
seem so nerve-
racking to me? 
Maybe I’m intimidated by my classmates? 
Like many University students, I was 
in the top of my class in many academic 
disciplines during high school. I felt con-
fident in my ability to succeed in classes, 
be it Honors Spanish or A.P. United States 
History. In college, I am confronted with 
the reality that we all come from second-
ary schools where we strove for the best 
and achieved it. We all succeeded aca-
demically and that’s why we attend this 
university.

In my Spanish course last semester, 

for example, I stuttered more often than 
usual because of struggles with the lan-
guage and because I strived to prove 
myself in the course. I wanted to prove 
that not only could I speak the language, 
but I could speak it fluidly.

For the majority of students, the ice-

breaker questions in those small seminar 
classes serve as a refuge from the monoto-
ny and boredom that may take place in the 
next 14 weeks. I enjoy these icebreakers as 
well. I get to learn about where my class-
mates are from and what they’re studying, 
for example. They also presents for me a 
challenge. In order to prevent my stut-
ter from occurring, I try to think of my 

answers in advance. As soon as I hear the 
question, I began to say quietly to myself. 
“My name is Avi. I’m a freshman from 
Los Angeles. I’m undeclared but lean-
ing toward American Culture or Public 
Policy.” For most, these simple questions 
are, in fact, simple. For the three million 
Americans who stutter, however, these 
questions may be the most anxiety-induc-
ing part of the class.

Don’t get me wrong — I love partici-

pating in class. I enjoy demonstrating my 
ideas to my peers and professors. Despite 
my stutter, I enjoy crafting oral presenta-
tions (depending on the topic, however). 
In order for my presentation to come 
out as fluidly as possible, I must practice 
and practice. While some may feel com-
fortable simply reading through slides 
without practicing, I often must practice 
multiple times to truly succeed.

I enjoy writing because I am judged 

on the quality of my words, not how they 
come out of our mouths. In speech, while 
we would prefer to believe we pay atten-
tion to rhetoric, the words often only suc-
ceed during a charismatic speech, such 
as the empowering “Yes We Can!” pio-
neered by Barack Obama eight years ago. 
In writing, the writer does not require 
astounding oratorical skills. They need 

only 
“speak” 

their 
mind 

without actu-
ally speaking. 
It’s 
interest-

ing to me: I 
love to speak 
my mind, yet 
sometimes it’s 
difficult 
not 

to 
articulate 

my 
opinion, 

but to actually 
“speak.” Few 

others have this problem.

On the first day of each semester I wish 

to share my thoughts with my classmates 
but sometimes refrain because we’re 
not acquainted yet. I have seen stares 
and whispering among neighbors after I 
added a comment in a freshman seminar. 
Whether it’s about my stutter or the accu-
racy of my input, I can’t say for sure. But it 
still brings me anxiety, simply because of 
my stutter.

Obviously, I wish my stutter could 

go away. As I learned from my speech 
therapist at a young age, it will always be 
a part of me. At some points in my life it 
will improve, and at other points it will 
get worse. I must learn how to manage 
it. In some ways, it gives me a determina-
tion that many lack. I strive not only to be 
the best in each course, but also to speak 
as fluidly as possible. In addition to my 
academic goals, I set goals based on how 
infrequently I stutter. While on the first 
days, it may be challenging, I know that as 
the course continues — as I develop rela-
tionships with my classmates and profes-
sors — the stares will disappear and the 
anxiety will cease, and I can then focus on 
making friends to study with and sit with.
