‘The University of Michigan 
Athletics Department announced 
Sunday night it was ending 
its 
“consulting 
relationship” 
between Rhonda Faehn and the 
Michigan women’s gymnastics 
team.
Faehn, a former senior vice 
president of USA Gymnastics 
who left amid the fallout of the 
Larry Nassar scandal, joined the 
coaching staff on Thursday, Jan 
10.
In the Department’s public 
statement 
disclosing 
the 
termination of Faehn’s contract, 
the 
University’s 
Director 
of 
Athletics Warde Manuel provided 
the following remarks:

“I have come to the conclusion 
that it is not in the best interest 
of the University of Michigan 
and our athletic program to 
continue the consulting contract 
with Rhonda Faehn. It was the 
wrong decision, and I apologize. 
Our student-athletes are our 
highest priority and I want to 
do everything in my power to 
support them fully and put the 
focus back on their athletic 
performance.”
The 
announcement 
came 
hours 
after 
Michigan’s 
Board of Regents expressed 
disappointment 
and 
concern 
regarding the new hire to the 
Detroit Free Press.
“I do not support the hiring 
of Rhonda Faehn, and believe 

While We Were Away is a new 
University of Michigan student-
run podcast and part of the Prison 
Creative Arts Project (PCAP), tells 
the stories of formerly incarcerated 
people and their experiences 
coming home.
LSA senior Hannah French, 
producer and co-founder of the 
podcast, said While We Were Away 
began when she and classmates 
noticed a lack of resources and 
support for those re-entering 
society. She said the podcast aims 
to give a voice to former prisoners.
“When we learned how many 
few resources there were for people 
coming home, we realized that 
could be our area,” French said. 
“Inside prison is an oral culture, 
but outside, once you come home, 
there really aren’t people to tell 
your stories to anymore because it 
is such a difficult decision whether 
to even tell someone that kind of 
past.”
Kathryn Condon, University 
alum and co-founder of While 
We Were Away, said in an email 
she hopes the podcast will open 
people’s minds and create empathy 
for ex-convicts.
“I hope that others can listen 
to this and relate on some level,” 
Condon said . “Whether they 
have been to prison or not, and 
feel empathy for a really tough 
transition that men and women 
sort of silently face on their own 
most of the time.”
A woman interviewed for the 
podcast, who wished to remain 

anonymous due to privacy and 
safety concerns, was arrested at 
age 23 after falling in love with a 
Sicilian gangster. She spent 18 years 
in prison after being convicted of 
multiple crimes, including murder. 
In this article, she will be referred 
to as Billy.
When Billy was released from 
prison, much of her life had passed 
by. She was unsure what her next 
steps should be.
“Coming out in my 40s and in 

menopause, I was feeling like I was 
washed up,” Billy said. “What do 
you do at that age to start from the 
beginning?”
According to a study done by 
the Bureau of Justice Statistics 
that began in 2005 and followed 
404,638 former prisoners from 30 
states, within 5 years of release 76.6 
percent of the ex-prisoners were 
rearrested.
Billy said she did not want to be 
another number. She wanted to 

start living a different life rather 
than resorting to old habits and, 
ultimately, winding back up in 
prison.
“I was really trying to get inside 
my inner self to find out who I 
was, and I didn’t want to turn 
around and be a statistic and be a 
revolving door,” Billy said.

With the beginning of the 
2019 
winter 
semester, 
the 
Interfraternity 
Council 
and 
the newly formed Ann Arbor 
Interfraternity 
Council 
are 
gearing up for 2019 Winter 
Rush alongside their member 
fraternities. Four fraternities at 
the University of Michigan— Delta 
Sigma Phi, Delta Tau Delta, Delta 
Upsilon and Psi Upsilon — hold 
membership in both bodies.
In September, six fraternities 
disaffiliated from the IFC, creating 
the AAIFC. The fraternities cited 
a new housing code from the 
Ann Arbor City Council and the 
University’s decision to implement 
formal winter rush beginning 
January 2020 as part of a plan 
to strengthen their First Year 
Experience plan.
Jean Lloyd, Delta Tau Delta 
brand communications manager, 
said in an email the chapter’s 
membership in both the IFC and 
AAIFC does not create conflicts, 
because both councils have similar 
policy expectations.

Students reflect on experiences with tuition packages, unclear guidelines

Many first-generation students 
at the University of Michigan say 
they find the financial aid process 
difficult to navigate, despite the 
resources available at U-M.
Social Work student Mallory 
Sprague said the financial resources 

for first-generation students are 
not heavily advertised, but they 
ultimately allowed her to participate 
in five study abroad programs 
during her time at the University.
“As a student and later as 
an adviser, I found that a lot of 
people didn’t know the extent of 
the resources we have access to,” 
Sprague said.

Sprague explained she wished 
the aid was more accessible to 
students.
“I expected the financial aid 
system to be tricky and resistant, 
but it has been surprisingly easy 
to navigate,” Sprague said. “I only 
wish that some of the funding 
opportunities were more widely 
advertised.

From Oct. 29 to Nov. 2, 2018, the 
University hosted First Gen Week 
to educate the community about 
obstacles first-generation students 
face and foster a sense of community 
among first-generation students.

the university should end its 
relationship with her,” Regent 
Mark Bernstein told the Free 
Press earlier in the day.
Regent Jordan Acker, who 
was 
elected 
to 
the 
board 
this November, provided the 
following statement on Twitter 
expressing his criticism of the 
selection of Faehn:
Morgan McCaul, an LSA 
sophomore 
and 
survivor 
of 
Nassar’s abuse, spoke to The 
Daily on Sunday evening about 
the importance of the message 
sent by the Athletic Department 
when it acted swiftly in reversing 
its decision on Faehn.
“Honestly, it’s been relieving 
and it’s been kind of whiplash,” 
McCaul said. “My experience 
with MSU has been that they 
dig their heels in and they refuse 
to admit when they’re wrong, 
and it’s taken a year and a half 

to see even a shred of change 
on that campus, so such a quick 
turnaround as to this situation 
has been unexpected and well-
received by myself and many 
other women I know.”
Since the moment the hire was 
announced, the decision spurred 
controversy, drawing both wide 
criticism on Twitter — including 
from Nassar survivors — as well 
as defense of the hiring decision 
from others, including current 
and former members of the 
gymnastics team.
Faehn was first spotted at 
the women’s gymnastics team’s 
second meet of the season, hosted 
at the University of Alabama, 
by Terrin Waack, a sports 
reporter for The Tuscaloosa 
News 
and 
TideSports.com, 
who was present at the meet 
in Tuscaloosa, Ala. On Friday 
evening, a spokesperson for the 
team confirmed to The Daily that 
Faehn had been hired on Jan 10. 
“I can confirm that Rhonda 
Faehn did join us recently 

and was with us tonight in 
Tuscaloosa for the meet,” the 
spokesperson said in a statement 
Friday evening.
Saturday 
afternoon, 
the 
University of Michigan Athletics 
Department 
issued 
a 
press 
release formally announcing and 
defending the hiring decision. 
The statement described Faehn’s 
role on staff as a “consultant in a 
coaching capacity”, though the 
Department website officially 
listed her title as an “assistant 
coach.” Faehn’s name has since 
been removed from the website.
In 
Saturday’s 
release, 
the 
University’s 
Director 
of 
Athletics Warde Manuel noted 
that “a thorough review of 
Faehn’s coaching career and 
her 
involvement 
with 
USA 
Gymnastics” 
was 
conducted 
before he decided to support the 
selection of Faehn.
“The well-being and safety 
of 
our 
student-athletes 
is 
always our highest priority,” 
Manuel stated Saturday. “Our 
current 
student-athletes 
had a prominent voice 
throughout 
this 
search 
process to provide their 
perspective. This included 
a meeting between me and 
the captains before a final 
decision was made.
“After our exhaustive 
due 
diligence, 
we 
felt 
comfortable 
that 
coach 
Faehn 
reported 
all 
information available to 
her regarding Larry Nassar 
and that she cooperated 
fully, including voluntarily 
participating 
in 
all 
investigations and offering 
testimony before Congress. 
Neither 
an 
internal 
investigation 
by 
USA 
Gymnastics or a criminal 
investigation by the FBI 
have assigned culpability 
or resulted in any charges 
against her.”
A 
day 
later, 
Manuel determined it was 
the “wrong decision.”
The addition of Faehn 
to the coaching staff was 
received as a controversial 
decision due to the nature 

of her departure from USA 
Gymnastics, which occurred in 
May 2018.
“I was extremely disturbed to 
find out that she had been hired, 
because I think it sends a message 
not just to survivors of Nassar’s 
abuse on campus, but it sends a 
message to all survivors on the 
campus that proven enablers 
would have been tolerated and 
would have been allowed to be 
hired and honestly be defended 
by the university,” McCaul said.
Early on in her position with 
USA Gymnastics, Faehn was 
notified about potential abuse 
concerns relating to then-team 
physician Larry Nassar. Faehn 
informed then-USA Gymnastics 
President Steve Penny of these 
concerns, and the organization 
went on to conduct an internal 
investigation before removing 
Nassar from his position or 
going to federal authorities, as 
was reported by the Associated 
Press in May.
USA Gymnastics failed to 
notify Michigan State University 
— where Nassar was a faculty 
member — of these concerns 
during this time frame. In the 
aftermath of Nassar pleading 
guilty to child pornography 
charges in the summer of 2017 
and to multiple counts of sexual 
assault of minors in the winter 
of 2018, the organization faced 
multiple lawsuits from victims.
Faehn was not specifically 
named in the lawsuits, but 
faced criticism from numerous 
Nassar survivors who called for 
her removal. This included U.S. 
Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman, 
who 
told 
the 
Indianapolis 
Star that she had reported 
Nassar’s abuse to Faehn in 
“graphic 
detail,” 
but 
Faehn 
and other officials waited a 
week before going to the FBI. A 
week after that interview, USA 
Gymnastics decided to part with 
Faehn. 
Her 
departure 
was 
met 
with mixed opinions from the 
gymnastics community.

To 
the 
Regents, 
President, 
and Provost of the University of 
Michigan and the Provost’s Blue 
Ribbon Panel (or anyone who is 
actually listening):
It is painfully clear that you 
are neither prepared to protect 
academic freedom nor the rights 
of marginalized students. As the 
University is under pressure from 
media, donors, and community 
members to justify punishing a 
professor and graduate student 
instructor for refusing to write 
letters of recommendation –– a 
task they are not required to do 
–– the creation of the Blue Ribbon 
Panel has served to buy the 
University some time. This Panel 
is tasked with “recommend[ing] 
appropriate 
considerations 
and 
principles” 
regarding 
faculty 
members’ political expressions and 
their responsibilities to students.

However, 
the 
panel’s 
vague 
charge 
to 
recommend 
considerations and principles, and 
the limit to its power as a mere 
recommending body that may 
be dismissed if found to be of the 
wrong political bent, demonstrate 
that the panel’s purpose is to serve 
as a shallow public relations ploy; a 
mere facade of serious engagement 
with the topic at hand.
The behavior of the panelists has 
reinforced this notion. In the almost 
three months since the Blue Ribbon 
Panel’s 
announcement, 
there 
have been no public statements 
about the Panel’s process, how it 
will operate, or what its research 
priorities even are. Provost Philbert 
and the panelists have abdicated 
their responsibility to the public, 
opting against transparency and 
community engagement at every 
turn.
Meanwhile, the “Opportunities 
for Input” survey put out by the 
panel was both leading and out 
of line with qualitative research 
norms. The first survey question, for 

example, proposes a set of faculty 
responsibilities to students, then 
proceeds to ask survey respondents 
whether or not they agree with 
them. This reduces the parameters 
of subject responses to an agree-
disagree binary, a pitfall any novice 
researcher trained in qualitative 
research is taught to avoid. In so 
doing, the Panel’s survey limits 
the issue to being a simple conflict 
between 
student 
and 
faculty 
interests, thereby precluding any 
considerations that fall outside of 
that framing.
The first “listening session” held 
on campus in Ann Arbor was just 
as telling, as it made certain that 
the panel would not even attempt 
meaningful engagement with the 
campus community. Facing a room 
of faculty, students, and community 
members, many of whom challenged 
the very legitimacy of the panel, the 
panelists refused to respond. When 
President Emeritus Duderstadt was 
asked direct procedural questions 
about the panel’s timeline, or how 
information collected by the panel 

would be analyzed, he plainly 
acknowledged that there was no 
plan. All other questions were met 
with silence and disdain, while 
Martin 
Philbert 
and 
Deborah 
Goldberg didn’t even bother to show 
up. Given the climate of fear and 
fragile calm holding over campus 
in the wake of threats made against 
Professor Cheney-Lippold’s job, it is 
appalling that the panel could not 
even affirm that survey responses 
would be anonymous.
And while the panel sets out 
to address political bias among 
professors, it ironically fails to 
account for its own problematic 
makeup. Out of the six faculty 
members on the panel, none come 
from humanities departments, and 
none have professional research 
experience addressing the racial-
colonial dynamics central to the 
issue at hand. Despite being formed 
in the wake of controversy over 
the University’s relationship to 
institutions in occupied Palestine, 
there are no Palestinian voices on 
the panel.

There are, however, at least 
two members with significant 
relationships 
or 
engagements 
with Israeli academic institutions. 
Deborah 
Loewenberg 
Ball 
has 
given 
presentations 
or 
lectures at six different Israeli 
institutions. 
Deborah 
Goldberg 
has held appointments at the 
Hebrew University of Jerusalem 
and the Blaustein Institute for 
Desert Research at Ben-Gurion 
University. It becomes difficult, 
then, to imagine this panel building 
room for dissenting views or 
serving any purpose other than 
to uphold established norms and 
silencing conscientious objection. 
In contrast, when U-M student 
governments on three campuses 
democratically passed resolutions 
calling for Divestment, University 
Regents Denise Ilitch and Mark 
Bernstein made loaded charges 
of anti-Semitism against them, 
the latter calling the resolutions 
“intellectually 
bankrupt 
and 
morally 
repugnant.” 
Clearly, 
the 
panel 
is 
uninterested 
in 

systematically addressing political 
bias; it serves only to reaffirm the 
Palestine exception to free speech.
For these reasons, the Blue 
Ribbon Panel should be dissolved. 
Instead, 
University 
leadership 
should follow the recommendations 
of letters signed by hundreds 
of 
faculty, 
graduate 
student 
instructors, students, professional 
and 
academic 
organizations, 
and 
Jewish 
and 
Palestinian 
communities advocating for the 
right of faculty and staff to engage in 
conscientious dissent without fear 
of repercussions. We also call on 
the University to end its fiscal ties to 
Israeli institutions and corporations 
by honoring democratically passed 
Divestment resolutions on all three 
University campuses. In doing so, 
the University can begin to build an 
environment of academic freedom 
for the entire campus community.

In Protest,
Direct Action for Palestine

December 
4th, 
1906: 
Founder’s Day for the first 
Black Greek Organization in 
the world at Cornell University, 
which began as a result of 
seven 
men 
rallying 
against 
racism 
and 
segregation 
in 
academic 
institutions 
and 
beyond. Established during a 
time where very few outlets 
for Black upliftment existed, 
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, 
Incorporated focuses on social 
and academic achievement with 
an emphasis on brotherhood 
at the core of its founding. In 
addition to being the oldest 
Black 
organization 
and 
the 
University of Michigan, Alpha 
Phi 
Alpha 
has 
developed 
numerous renowned members 
that have spearheaded changes 
in 
society 
for 
generations. 
Notable brothers include Martin 
Luther 
King 
Jr., 
Thurgood 

Marshall and W.E.B. Du Bois, 
all of which are examples that 
showcase 
the 
prestige 
and 
honor of carrying the Alpha 
title. The Epsilon chapter at the 
University of Michigan has been 
around since 1909, making it 
one of the oldest chapters in the 
organization’s history.
To 
open 
their 
Founder’s 
Day this year, each one of the 
members welcomed attendees 
and emphasized their focus on 
community through a social 
hour. Displaying their national 
recognitions 
and 
awards, 
their hard work shows they 
have pioneered for over more 
than 100 years of service and 
leadership. All nine members 
openly invited the community 
for a time of socialization, with 
food and dance –– creating a 
day that not only celebrated the 
founding of their organization 
but also to uniting the Black 
community is always a welcome 
sight on campus.
“To me, Alpha Phi Alpha is 
more than just a fraternity,” 

D’Andre Simpson, Alpha Phi 
Alpha Epsilon chapter President 
said. 
“It’s 
an 
everlasting 
brotherhood that has allowed 
me to grow as a leader, serve 
my 
community, 
and 
most 
importantly meet the uncles 
of my future children. The 
brotherhood and service of my 
fraternity goes beyond college 
and I will forever have an 
impact on the world through my 
organization.”
The social hour was followed 
by a step reception. Through the 
cold and windy air, all Alpha 
brothers stood on the steps 
of Rackham graduate school, 
proudly showcasing their black 
and gold colors with heads held 
high. Brothers performed their 
difficult, sharp and powerful 
stroll 
routine, 
reciting 
the 
fraternity’s 
critical 
moments

When I joined Michigan in Color 
as a Senior Editor, I didn’t know 
that I would find a home. I have 
found some of my closest friends, 
change agents, and accountability 
partners in this platform. Over 
time, I have learned that we are 
more than a newspaper. We are a 
catalyst, a moment, to both uplift 
and preserve the truths of students 
of color. I feel immense pride in 
being a part of an organization 
that has contributed to over one 
hundred years of generational 
knowledge, and I feel even more 
proud as Michigan in Color goes 
into its fifth year of preserving the 
voices and experiences of people 
of color on campus. It is evident 
that our impact has exceeded the 
boundaries of our campus and has 
inspired other universities, such 
as UC Berkeley, to establish their 
own sections for students of color.
It is with great honor and 
elation that I present my voice as 
an empowered, happy, confident 
Black Woman, shredded of the 
insecurity that made my voice 
tremble years ago. I have found 
great solace and spiritual healing 

through the power of words and 
truth telling. In a world where 
women of color, and Black women 
especially, are subject to extreme 
levels 
of 
hypervisibility 
and 
systemic silencing, Michigan in 
Color has been a space for me to 
reclaim my visibility and agency 
and to define who I am and what 
I stand for. It’s been a platform 
that is unique in its simultaneous 
embrace of PoC intellectuality 
and authenticity. Just as I have 
developed my confidence as a 
Black female scholar, I have gained 
so much from being privileged to 
the insights and lessons that other 
students have shared through our 
platform.
I am unsure if I think of myself 
as a writer, nor am I sure if I think 
of myself as a journalist. However, 
in a time period where journalism 
is showded in falsehood and 
malice and when PoC voices 
are systemically silenced and 
sidelined, I know that a platform 
such as ours is critical.
I give credit to MiC for so much 
of my growth and abundance of 
opportunity. I have traveled to 

Washington, D.C. and explored 
the roots of my African-American 
heritage. I have critically analyzed 
film representation, and I have 
joined other student organizations 
in community and fellowship. 
Most importantly, MiC has given 
me new friends and a close-
knit community of activists and 
change-agents who have held 
me accountable to expanding 
my capacity for empathy across 
identity intersections. I will forever 
be grateful for this experience, 
and I look forward to furthering 
the mission and potential of our 
publication.
It is within the pages of a campus 
newspaper that I offer a platform 
of refuge — a platform to tell your 
story amongst the countless pages 
and think-pieces that are trying 
to tell it for you. I offer a space 
grounded in radical self-love and 
belief in the power of storytelling 
and words, a place to unlearn 
and unpack generations worth 
of taught self-hate and identity 
dissonance. I welcome you to write 
your truth, one word at a time.

Making a newspaper every 
night is really hard. Coupled 
with the pressure of uphold-
ing “128 years of editorial 
freedom” and a full load of 
classes, many nights mak-
ing a newspaper seems like 
a miracle. But what’s made 
it manageable have been the 
thoughtful, 
resilient 
advo-
cates I work beside. What’s 
made it fun is the ability of 
Daily staff to take their work 
very seriously without taking 
themselves seriously. What’s 
made it feel crucial are the 
times when I get to help put 
a woman of color on the front 
page, the times when a story 
moves me to tears or laugh-
ter or both, and knowing that 
maybe one more person feels 
affirmed in their ability to tell 
stories and maybe one more 
person listened to a story they 
wouldn’t have heard other-
wise.
It’s that last feeling, the 
idea that any one published 
story could change someone’s 
worldview or make some-
one’s day, that brings me to 
the Michigan in Color desk.

I’m here because right now, 
nothing feels more impor-
tant than giving a platform 
to those who are quieted, ig-
nored or misconstrued. Too 
often, journalism’s gatekeep-
ers prevent journalists of col-
or from entering the field in 

fear that people of color are 
too biased by their own iden-
tity to write objectively or in 
fear that people of color are 
too “risky” and will alienate 
racist readers. I am confident 
in the ability of Michigan in 
Color to help combat journal-
ism’s systemically discrimina-
tory structures. However, the 
onus of fixing a systematically 

discriminatory system cannot 
be placed entirely on journal-
ists of color, and I hope that 
in my tenure, The Michigan 
Daily as a whole can help dis-
mantle journalism’s cycle of 
inequity.
I am so grateful to Ashley 
and Jason for believing in my 
ability to help lead this sec-
tion, and I am so humbled by 
the Michigan in Color staff 
I will be working beside –– 
you guys are reason enough 
to join. Notably, I would not 
be here if not for Christian, 
whose 
unending 
initiative 
and creativity modeled the 
similarly unending opportu-
nities this space provides, if 
not for Nisa, whose journal-
ism journey gave me some-
thing to aspire to, and if not 
for Maya, who is certainly the 
best boss I’ll ever have.
It is an extreme privilege to 
have access to this space, and 
I hope to do right by its beau-
ty and history. This is going 
to be a year of being loud and 
brave and energetic and vul-
nerable –– I can’t wait for you 
to hear what we have to say.

Trigger warning: Column discusses 
graphic scenes of sexual assault.
T

witter 
has 
become 
a platform for social 
and political activism. 
While scrolling through tweets, 
I sometimes come across cute 
photos of dogs and the occasional 
heartwarming video, but I mostly 
see tweets aimed at controversial 
media and news. One television 
show that has sparked a large 
amount of these tweets is the 
Netflix series “Thirteen Reasons 
Why.”
One 
scene, 
in 
particular, 
fueled contentious debate. In 
season 2 of “Thirteen Reasons 
Why,” there’s a scene in which 
one of the characters, Tyler, is 
confronted by the much stronger, 
more aggressive Monty. In the 
shocking scene, Monty smashes 
Tyler’s head against the bathroom 
sinks repeatedly before dragging 
him to the toilets and sodomizing 
him with a mop as Tyler screams 
out in pain.
Many people took to Twitter 
to voice their thoughts about the 
necessity of the scene. Many who 
opposed the inclusion of the scene 
argued that such graphic scenes 
are unnecessary and that the 
trigger warning at the beginning 
of the episode was insufficient. 
Those in favor of the scene argued 
that the scene was supposed to 
be uncomfortable for viewers 
to watch and was crucial for 
“starting the conversation” about 
male victim sexual assault.
As someone who watched both 
seasons of “Thirteen Reasons 
Why” 
I 
became 
physically 
sickened by that scene, so I went 
on Twitter to read the debates 
about the series, and there was 
one part of the argument in favor 
of the scene that baffled me: There 
was no depth in the conversation. 
The 
only 
conversation 
about 
male rape centered on whether 
the scene with Tyler and Monty 
should have been put in the show 
or not. The main conversations 
were about how Hannah and Zach 
(two of the protagonists who were 
briefly involved in a relationship) 
“deserved 
better” 
and 
the 

attractiveness of Justin Foley, 
another one of the protagonists. 
There were a few miscellaneous 
tweets about how male rape is 
more common than people think, 
and how people need to discuss 
it, but they got lost among the 
photo edits of Zach and Hannah, 
as well as tweet threads about the 
controversial scene. Nothing was 
factual, in-depth or executed with 
care.
It seems as though “starting 
the conversation” has become an 
excuse, rather than the reason, 
for sharing shocking and often 
graphic content about sensitive 
topics. However, the response to 
the scene in “Thirteen Reasons 
Why” serves as a prime example as 
to why creating and then releasing 
graphic content that relates to 
prevalent societal issues doesn’t 
really do anything.
Doing something to simply 
“start the conversation” is a 
lazy, problematic approach to 
tackling issues. It’s a cop-out 
that absolves the person starting 
the conversation of any event 
that ensues, and showing people 
horrifying scenes to “start the 
conversation” 
about 
societal 
issues 
is 
the 
equivalent 
of 
showing children porn to “start 
the 
conversation” 
about 
safe 
sex. Starting a conversation is 
important, but so is facilitating it 
and making sure that something 
comes out of it. Content like the 
scene in “Thirteen Reasons Why” 
might have encouraged some 
people to learn more and engage in 
meaningful dialogue, but for most 
people, it just becomes something 
shocking to tweet about before 
losing interest. It is naive to assume 
that after watching a graphic scene 
in a television show, viewers will 
engage in meaningful dialogue 
about the scene and then go on to 
become some kind of activist for 
whatever issue or topic the scene 
covered. More often than not, 
viewers become traumatized by 
what they watch and discuss the 
scene rather than the trauma itself 
and then forget about it.
This is clear even when 
examining how people react to 
the news: People have become 

so desensitized to horrific events 
such as mass shootings that while 
they might initially feel awful 
when hearing about such an event 
and discuss it, many people tend 
to forget about the event and move 
on with their lives. This isn’t to 
say that the news shouldn’t report 
about such events. However, the 
news has shown us that simply 
showing people horrible things 
that happen to others does not 
result in real change.
While 
media 
depicting 
graphic scenes might have more 
shock value and more potential to 
become viral and, thus, reach more 
people, it doesn’t do anything 
but shock people before being 
forgotten. In order to encourage 
people to discuss issues in an 
impactful way, we must direct 
them so that know even where 
to start considering, conversing 
and changing. For example, if 
“Thirteen Reasons Why” hadn’t 
shown that scene, and had 
instead perhaps only alluded to 
such an event happening (after 
inserting a hefty trigger warning) 
and had followed it up with an 
unavoidable discussion between 
the cast member and experts or 
statistics about sexual assault, the 
show might have succeeded in 
creating and facilitating an actual, 
meaningful conversation about 
sexual assault.
People need to be given 
direction when asked to deal with 
complex problems. It’s lazy to 
drop a bombshell on unsuspecting 
viewers and then essentially leave 
them to figure everything out by 
themselves. Instead, we must 
educate people about certain 
topics without traumatizing or 
triggering them and then offer 
ways in which they can help, 
such as by providing the names of 
certain organizations that work 
towards change or the names of 
proposed pieces of legislature 
people can help support. Starting 
a conversation is important, but 
it only helps if there are people 
willing to act following it.

Don’t just “start the conversation”

What conservatives get wrong about identity politics

AARON BAKER | COLUMN

N

othing evokes a more 

visceral reaction from 

modern 
conservatives 

than political correctness and 

identity 
politics. 
Conservatives 

often point to the annoyance of 

identity 
politics 
and 
political 

correctness as the reason for 

President 
Donald 
Trump’s 

election. Jonah Goldberg, fellow 

and Asness Chair in Applied 

Liberty at American Enterprise 

Institute, explained how identity 

politics are destroying Western 

civilization as we know it in his 

book “Suicide of the West: How the 

Rebirth of Tribalism, Populism, 

Nationalism, and Identity Politics is 

Destroying American Democracy.” 

Similarly, the popular intellectual 

Jordan Peterson decries political 

correctness and identity politics 

as “Marxist,” “totalitarian” and 

“postmodern.” Peterson is only 

right that political correctness and 

identity politics are postmodern, 

however, 
that 
shouldn’t 
scare 

conservatives. Most opposition to 

political correctness and so-called 

identity politics is rooted in 

misperceptions.

Conservatives 
and 
critics 

of 
political 
correctness 
and 

identity politics argue the two 

movements 
are 
symptoms 
of 

cultural 
collectivism. 
Political 

correctness and identity politics 

supporters, according to many 

conservatives, view life through the 

reductive lens of race, gender and 

sexuality in which everything is a 

power struggle, creating only the 

oppressors and the oppressed. To 

conservatives, those who talk about 

racism or sexism are only thinking 

about their membership in a group 

— a modern form of tribalism. It 

is this tribalism that challenges 

the pillars of Western civilization, 

specifically 
the 
Enlightenment 

values of individual rights and 

rationality.

When 
conservatives 
deride 

identity politics, they eschew any 

political discourse that touches 

on 
prejudice. 
All 
democratic 

politics 
are 
coalition-based 
in 

some way, requiring appeals to 

voting coalitions that are often, in 

some way, identity-based. What 

conservatives 
deem 
identity 

politics is simply politics that 

discuss racism, sexism, xenophobia 

or any issues created by prejudicial 

thinking in some way, and political 

correctness is simply an effort to 

use language and concepts that 

are more inclusive and fairer. 

The goals and effects of identity 

politics and political correctness 

are primarily about individualism, 

which 
conservatives 
rightly 

support. 
Of 
course, 
identity 

politics and political correctness 

can go too far, but the core ideas of 

political correctness and identity 

politics are valid and necessary.

The 
Enlightenment 
was 

a 
multifaceted 
intellectual 

movement 
that 
produced 
a 

wide array of ideas. I would say 

conservatives are right when they 

talk about Enlightenment values 

of individualism and rationality 

and the benefits they provide 

democracies around the world. 

The only problem is the idea of the 

rational individual that comes from 

the Enlightenment has historically 

been qualified and limited. White 

men were considered as rational, 

autonomous agents, but everyone 

else was perceived as inferior, less 

rational and less autonomous.

The fact that the Enlightenment 

championed 
empiricism 
and 

scientific discovery is something 

to be celebrated, as the human 

condition has improved immensely 

since the Scientific Revolution. But 

there were two problems. The first 

was that scientific knowledge in 

the 1700s was limited and flawed. 

Second was that the Enlightenment 

created 
scientism, 
in 
which 

scientific truths discovered and 

verified about the natural world 

are applied to social realities. The 

result was shoddy science used 

to justify oppressive ideologies 

that 
categorized 
humans 
and 

dictated how they should live and 

interact with others. This thinking 

ultimately 
produced 
Social 

Darwinism, scientific racism and 

biologically-justified 
sexism 
in 

the 19th and 20th century, the 

remnants of which are still alive in 

our society today.

Postmodernism 
says 
there 

are no absolute truths in social 

realities, 
only 
constructs 
and 

human inventions. There are truths 

in the scientific world, but they 

are irrelevant for how humans 

should live their lives. Biological 

differences 
between 
individual 

humans or groups of humans are 

largely irrelevant in a social or 

political setting.

As Yuval Noah Harari writes 

in his book “Sapiens: A Brief 

History of Humankind,” humans 

have used their cognition to 

imagine social realities, stories 

and structures since the so-called 

cognitive revolution some 30,000 

years ago. These social realities 

allowed Homo sapiens to organize 

themselves in ways other animals 

were 
unable 
to, 
advantaging 

humans and allowing them to 

climb the food chain. According 

to Harari, this is the primary 

difference between humans and 

other animals: We can invent 

social realities that override our 

underlying biological impulses in 

determining human action and 

organization.

Postmodernism is cognizant of 

the construction of social realities 

— a process wherein language 

plays an important role. Therefore, 

political correctness and identity 

politics seek to use language to 

challenge historic schemas. These 

dictate human behavior based on 

group identities — race, gender or 

others — that were bequeathed 

to us from the scientism of the 

past. 
Postmodernism 
tells 
us 

one’s 
phenotype, 
reproductive 

organs, sexuality or other traits 

are irrelevant to an individual’s 

capabilities 
or 
personalities, 

leaving them to carve their own 

fates.

The individualism so many 

conservatives champion is thus 

an incomplete idea of what it 

means to be an individual. It is 

only concerned with individualism 

between citizen and government, 

as envisioned by the vertical 

social contract of John Locke. 

This is totally legitimate as the 

worst crimes against humanity 

have 
been 
committed 
by 

tyrannical governments. Liberty 

and 
individualism 
require 

examining the lateral relationships 

between people, especially where 

majorities can oppress minorities 

by creating social realities that 

limit, categorize and essentialize 

them. Conservatives can do a 

good job in acknowledging the 

former, but fail to do so in the 

latter. Likewise, liberals can be 

guilty of the opposite: succeeding 

in challenging oppressive social 

norms and language, but remaining 

unconcerned 
with 
unchecked 

government power and coercion.

There’s room for a middle 

ground in the polarized debate over 

political correctness. Conservatives 

who care about individual liberty 

should consider the possibilities 

of 
adopting 
postmodern 
ideas 

prevalent on college campuses. 

For 
social 
conservatives, 

postmodernism is likely a hard pill 

to swallow. But for conservatives 

who prioritize low taxes or an active 

foreign policy, political correctness 

and postmodernism don’t have to 

be strongly opposed. By ceding all 

postmodern ideas to liberals and 

progressives, 
conservatives 
are 

losing potential allies.

Likewise, liberals who engage 

in censorship and social media 

shaming are also losing potential 

allies. Harmful speech should 

be countered by better speech. 

Protesters who stopped Charles 

Murray’s 
speech 
on 
campus 

probably didn’t convince anyone 

who agreed with his pseudo-

scientific, 
prejudice-enabling 

ideas. Forcing people to use the 

right language won’t convince 

them the ideas behind the changes 

in language are valid, and the 

oppressive concepts will persist.

Changing language and social 

norms can help alter unconscious 

bias, 
according 
to 
research 

suggesting language shapes the 

way we think. But if people don’t 

believe the change in norms or 

language is necessary or even 

valid, then different language will 

be adopted to produce the same 

oppressive effects.

T

hroughout 
history, 
society 
has 
frequently 
utilized 
the 
band-aid 
method – we love a quick fix. In 1863, 
William Banting wrote the “Letter 
on Corpulence,” popularizing fad 
diets for the first time. Instead of 
promoting a reduction in sugar intake 
or encouraging exercise, Banting 
believed the cure to corpulence, or 
obesity, was a low-carbohydrate diet. 
Banting’s work precipitated the rise 
of the dieting industry, now worth 
$66.3 billion per year; however, even 
today global obesity is on the rise. For 
centuries, society has sought a single 
quick-fix to multiplex issues, like 
obesity, by creating oversimplified 
solutions that erroneously promise 
easy results instead of focusing on the 
situation as a whole.
Today, the complex issue we 
confront is plastic pollution in our 
oceans and the need to preserve 
these vital bodies of water for the 
future of our planet. Plastic in the 
oceans has begun to infiltrate our 
food system and kill sea life with no 
end in sight. Over the last 65 years, 
plastic use has increased 200-fold. 
Instead of addressing the crisis as a 
whole, we have fragmented the issue. 
Following the 2015 video “‘No’ to 
Plastic Straws,” society has shifted its 
attention to the elimination of plastic 
straws, the biggest trend of 2018. In 
doing so, we have ignored other more 
significant perpetrators of pollution 
that are killing the oceans.
The 
eradication 
of 
plastic 
straws intends to prevent the 
pervasive issue of plastic pollution 
in our oceans, but there is no such 
thing as a simple solution to a 
complex issue. Multifold problems 
cannot be fragmented. The oceans 
cannot be salvaged strictly by 
getting rid of all plastic straws, a 
small part of the problem.
As a society, we have to fully 
evaluate the causes of plastic 
pollution 
and 
take 
responsive 
actions targeted toward attaining 
the most efficacious and positive 
outcomes while mitigating the 
effects, no matter how arduous 
the process may be. The complete 
eradication of plastic straws is 
unlikely because people living 
with disabilities rely on plastic 
straws to assist in their dietary 
intake. However, even if activists 

succeed, plastic straws only make 
up a lowly 0.025 percent of the 
estimated 8 million tons of plastic 
that pollute the oceans annually. 
According to USA Today, straws 
were seventh on the list of items 
collected on 2017’s International 
Coastal Cleanup Day, far behind 
wrappers, bottles with caps, and 
bags. It is not plastic straws that 
are the issue, it’s plastic in general. 
Society is magnifying the issue of 
straws and, in doing so, distracting 
attention and remediation efforts 
from more significant polluters. In 
fact, the abatement of plastic straws 
will not lead to a concurrent decline 
in pollution as total plastic pollution 
is projected to triple by 2025.
Supporters of “The Last Practice 
Straw” movement, however, assert 
plastic straws are a gateway to 
the larger issue of global plastic 
consumption 
and 
pollution, 
an 
issue so grave that by 2050 plastic 
is projected to outweigh fish in the 
ocean. Except it is just not working. 
People are evidently rationalizing 
their use of other plastics because 
they no longer use plastic straws. 
Travis 
Bradberry, 
author 
of 
“Emotional 
Intelligence 
2.0,” 
recognizes this human tendency as 
the compensation effect. “Humans 
use good deeds to balance out 
bad deeds, or alternately, we give 
ourselves breaks from goodness,” 
Bradberry writes. Therefore, when 
a person stops using plastic straws, 
they accumulate an assumed moral 
capital that they then use to justify 
other 
environmentally-damaging 
actions.
I myself have fallen victim 
to this effect. Earlier this year, a 
friend noticed my metal straws 
leaning against my box of granola 
bars, each individually covered in 
a plastic wrapper. He commented 
on the irony of this display. I 
irrationally justified the excess use 
of plastic, touting my refusal to 
use plastic straws. I had assembled 
so much moral capital that I 
blinded myself to how my other 
choices detrimentally affected the 
environment. This mindset begets 
disaster for our oceans.
We are fighting a losing and 
distracting battle. Even if we 
eradicate 
plastic 
straws, 
total 
pollution in the oceans will become 

only a scintilla less. It is time 
we create a strategy to actually 
curtail 
total 
plastic 
pollution. 
The elimination of plastic straws 
is a simple solution that, while 
positive in its minor impact on 
the environment, merely focuses 
on a single and small aspect of 
all 
oceanic 
plastic 
pollution. 
Regrettably, this focus on just a 
facet of the problem detrimentally 
increases an individual’s assumed 
moral capital and prevents a more 
comprehensive solution.
It is estimated there are 15 to 
51 trillion pieces of microplastics 
in the ocean and an additional 5.25 
trillion visible pieces of other plastic. 
The Pacific Ocean has an “island” 
of plastic that is three times the 
size of France. For real change, it is 
critical that we confront the plastic 
epidemic head-on, instead of fighting 
a minimally-impactful battle on the 
side.
I 
recognize 
plastic 
straws 
are unique in the fact they are 
lightweight and can slide through 
mechanical recycling sorters. I 
acknowledge they are a contributing 
factor to plastic pollution and I 
applaud every person and company 
that has phased plastic straws out, 
but we must consider this only a first 
step, not a finish line. To establish 
real change, we cannot just focus 
on straws. Since the first recorded 
fad diet in 1863, we have focused on 
creating simple solutions to complex 
societal problems and it has not 
worked. Society must learn from its 
failures and focus not on the easy fad 
response, but rather the often more 
difficult, comprehensive solution. 
The campaign to #StopSucking is not 
entirely cutting it, instead, we must 
#StopUsing. Decreasing our plastic 
footprint will take diligence, from 
refusing a plastic-wrapped snack to 
carrying a reusable bag and bottle.
It is vital to the longevity of 
our oceans and humanity that we 
change the norms of our everyday 
lives and challenge those of others. 
Eliminating plastic straws is not 
enough, because there is no such 
thing as a simple solution or magical 
elixir to resolve the issue of plastic

There was a time when it 

seemed 
possible 
that 
“The 

Upside,” a drama based on a 2011 
French cultural phenomenon 
and starring one of the most 
acclaimed actors of the last 
decade and one of the most 
popular comedians on planet 
Earth, wouldn’t get a release. 
The film premiered at the 2017 
Toronto 
International 
Film 

Festival, about a year and a 
half ago. It was picked up for 
distribution 
and set for a 
March 2018 
release date, 
but a month 
later 
its 

distributor, 
The 
Weinstein 
Company, 
found 
itself 

facing 
the 
legal 

firestorm 
that 
jumpstarted 
the #MeToo 
movement 
and 
continues 
to shift the power structure 
of Hollywood today. It sat on 
a shelf for nearly a year before 
STX Entertainment and Lantern 
Entertainment, the successor to 
The Weinstein Company, bought 
it, retooled it for a PG-13 rating 

and re-slated it for release.

I open by recounting the story 

of “The Upside” not just because 
it provides a look into how even 
a movie with so much 
going for it can still 
nearly fall through the 
cracks and how other 
movies that have fallen 
through the cracks can 
come to be “rescued,” 
but because the story 
behind “The Upside” is 
much more interesting 
than anything about 
“The 
Upside” 
itself. 

Like 
“Green 
Book” 

before 
it, 

it seems to 
strive to be 
the 
most 

milquetoast, 
inoffensive 
race 

relations 
story 

possible, but where 
“Green 
Book” 
at 

least had the comfort 
of 
stylish 
period 

trappings to propel 
it into something an 
iota above average, 
“The 
Upside” 
has 

only its underserved 
leads.

The story follows 

Dell 
Scott 
(Kevin 

Hart, 
The 
91st 

Academy A—I mean, “Night 
School”), a down-on-his-luck 
ex-con looking for a job who 
eventually finds it with Phillip 
Lacasse 
(Bryan 
Cranston, 

“Sneaky Pete”), a quadriplegic 
billionaire in need of a live-in 

life assisstant. Phillip is struck 
by Dell’s cavalier attitude during 
the interview and hires him, and 
the two men form a friendship 

that will not 
only change 
their lives for 
the 
better, 

but 
maybe, 

just 
maybe, 

will 
teach 

themselves 
a 
little 

something 
about 
themselves.

For 
all 

the 
well-

deserved 
controversy 
currently 
surrounding 

him, it’s hard to see Hart’s 
performance in “The Upside” 
as anything other than his best 
yet. What he needs is a director 
who can rein in his boundless 
energy and channel it towards 
something productive rather 
than the same types of ego-
stroking riffs that serve only 
to pad the runtime. Here, Hart 
seems to find that in Neil Burger 
(“Divergent”), who gives him his 
fair share of comedic moments 
but also forces him to, you 
know, act. His chemistry with 
Cranston is particularly strong, 
and their odd couple dynamic 
provides the movie with its best 
moments.

The problem is that those 

moments 
are 
few 
and 
far 

between. For all the restraint 

he shows with his use of 
Hart, 
Burger’s 
direction 

of the rest of the film 
results in little more than 
a shot-for-shot remake of 
the original French film 
“The Intouchables,” warts 
and all. The stilted social 
commentary is there. The 
predictable story is there. 
Even the opening scene is 
virtually an exact copy of the 
original film. The only thing 
of note added is a romantic 
subplot between Phillip and 
his executive Yvonne (Nicole 
Kidman, 
“Boy 
Erased”), 

a story so familiar that it 
only serves to further the 
feeling that this script was 
assembled from the pages of 
other films.

That’s what “The Upside” 

feels like more often than 
not. It’s not a bad movie. It’s 
not a good movie. It’s a well-
acted but deeply uninspired 
movie which tries for social 
relevance and falls flat on 
its face. I’m not arguing 
that every story has to be 
completely 
original, 
but 

there are no surprises here. 
We’ve seen it with “The 
Blind Side.” We’ve seen it 
with “Green Book.” Now we 
see it with “The Upside.” If 
you can read the synopsis 
above and honestly say that 
you can’t predict beat-by-
beat where that story will go 
and how it will eventually 
end, then maybe you’ll find 
some enjoyment here. But if 
you’ve seen any inspirational 
drama in the last twenty 
years, this will likely do very 
little for you.

‘The Upside’ proves to be 
absolutely milquetoast

Upside’

Quality 16

Even the 

opening scene 
is virtually an 
exact copy of 
the original 

film.

After 
fifteen 
years 
on 

Broadway, “Wicked” has set 
out to make a change. Britney 
Johnson 
was 
recently 
cast 

as the first black Glinda in 
a 
Broadway 
production 
of 

“Wicked,” 
making 
history 

for the world-
famous musical. 
Despite 
the 

fact 
that 
the 

musical has had 
many people of 
color 
playing 

principal 
roles 

like 
Elphaba, 

Madame 
Morrible, Fiyero 
and 
Nessarose, 

the role of the 
Good Witch of 
the North has 
traditionally 
been held by a 
white 
actress. 

The 
beloved 

story took on an 
entirely different 
meaning 
with 

Johnson as the 
sparkly, 
ditzy 

and 
“popular” 

character, 
allowing 
the 

audience to see 
new rays of light 
in the story that 
previously went 
unnoticed. 

With 
Glinda 

as a person of 
color, there is a 
level of empathy 
between 
green 

Elphaba and the 
good witch that 
creates a greater 
semblance 
of 
similarity 

between 
the 

characters’ 
journeys. 
The 

musical 
follows 
themes 
of 

love, connection and kindness, 
preaching the message that 
strong female friendships are 
able to withstand divisions, 
animosity 
and 
feelings 
of 

otherness. 
Additionally, 
the 

span 
of 
Glinda’s 
character 

arc is greatly widened when 
we see her through this new 
lens, allowing her growth as 
a character to resonate more 
soundly with the audience. The 
audience certainly resonated 
with the newfound complexity 
of the character, with videos 
circulating on the internet 
showing 
audience 
members 

roaring with applause during 
Johnson’s 
first 
scene 
on 

stage 
where 
Glinda 
utters 

the perfectly fitting opening 
line: “It’s good to see me, isn’t 
it?” This reaction was born of 
excitement because Johnson 
made history as she floated 
down from the blue skies of Oz 
in her glittery bubble, but from 
something deeper as well. The 
seeds for change and for a more 
diverse Broadway were planted 
on that celebrated Gershwin 

stage this past weekend. Now 
those seeds must be nurtured 
by audiences, privileged actors, 
minority actors and creators 
alike to help them to grow.

While 
musicals 
like 

“Hamilton” 
and 
“On 
Your 

Feet” created many roles for 
Latinx, Black and minority 
actors, it is still very rare to see 
minorities cast in traditionally 

white held roles 
on 
Broadway. 

Musical theatre 
seems to be on 
the 
trajectory 

towards a more 
inclusive reality 
and progress is 
being made on 
major stages, but 
it is by no means 
equal 
in 
any 

sense of the word. 
According to an 
Asian American 
Performers 
Action Coalition 
Ethnic 
Representation 
in 
New 
York 

Stages 
Report, 

in the 2015-2016 
season 23 percent 
of 
Broadway 

roles were held 
by Black actors, 
7 
percent 
by 

Latinx actors, 4 
percent by Asian 
American actors 
and 
all 
other 

minorities held 2 
percent of roles. 
These 
statistics 

prove that while 
progress 
has 

been 
made 
in 

terms 
of 
more 

representation 
on the Broadway 
stage, 
there 
is 

still much to be 
done. The same 

report states 15.4 percent of 
all available roles were non-
traditionally 
cast, a spike up 
from 
previous 

years 
but 
still 

a 
low 
figure. 

Every day, when 
minorities 
are 
cast 
into 

traditional, 
previously white 
cast 
roles, 
we 

take 
one 
step 

closer to finding 
a semblance of 
equality. But in 
order to continue 
this 
progress, 

all 
theatres, 

casting directors 
and 
producers 

need 
to 
be 

cognizant of the 
changes that are 
required to bring 
momentous 
stories 
like 

Johnson’s 
further 
away 

from anomaly and closer to the 
norm.

Many 
recent 
Broadway 

shows are working tirelessly 
on improving representation, 
which 
was 
seen 
in 
2016 

through the casting of African 
actress Noma Dumezweni as 
Hermione Granger in the stage 
adaptation of “Harry Potter and 
the Cursed Child.” Upon the 
casting announcement, many 
longtime Harry Potter fans 
expressed 
their 
disapproval 

of the decision. However, J. K. 
Rowling, author of the novel 
and play, made a statement on 
Twitter almost immediately, 
saying she never specified skin 
tone in her writing and “loves 
black 
Hermione.” 
Changing 

Hermione’s face for the stage 
adaptation provided a much-
needed layer of diversity to the 
whitewashed world presented 
in the “Harry Potter” films and 
adds a fascinating perspective 
that was previously not present 
in the story.

Storytelling on the Broadway 

stage is evolving. However, we 
cannot simply call it quits and 
feel satisfied with the work put 
in to increase representation 
when 
we 
make 
marginal 

improvements. There is still 
work to be done. There are still 
widespread discrepancies in 
opportunities. When one Black 
Glinda breaks through the 
formerly padlocked door, we 
must honor her commitment, 
talent and perseverance. We 
must help hold the door open 
so that more minority actors 
can have the opportunity to 
hold non-traditional roles on 
commercial stages. We must 
help hold the door open so that 
the statistics can be raised to a 
more equal standard.

Changing the narrative and 

the perspective of commonly 
known, traditional stories by 
way of increasing theatrical 
representation 
provides 

musicals and plays with the 
ability to transform beautifully 
without altering the script or 

scenario at all. 
Not only should 
we 
be 
casting 

minorities 
in 

non-traditional 
roles to increase 
representation, 
we 
should 

be 
giving 

minorities these 
opportunities 
because it makes 
the 
stories 

more 
beautiful, 

intricate 
and 
colorful. 

Providing depth 
to 
these 
roles 

and 
color 
to 

these characters 
transforms 
stories 
into 
a 

wider, 
more 

complete 
and 

more 
inclusive 

dimension. 
These actors are 
the 
beginning 

of a new Broadway: one where 
color is celebrated, triumphed 
and most of all, the standard.

New ‘Wicked’ is a triumph

6A — Monday, January 14, 2019
Arts
The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

Country 
has 
a 
distinct 
sensibility, 
one 
capable 
of 
evoking 
specific 
landscapes 
and brands of sorrow, joy and 
attraction. In After All, Rob 
Baird directs this sensibility 
toward the emotional journey of 
a breakup. He follows the classic 
trajectory 
of 
other 
breakup 
albums of this ilk, tracing the 
stages from denial to despair to 
anger and betrayal to eventual 
resolve and acceptance. It’s 
a familiar path, so it’s saying 
something for Baird that After 
All 
still 
sounds 
completely 
fresh, 
original 
and 
genuinely 
heartfelt.
A 
notable 
component 
of 
the 
album’s 
effectiveness 
is 
Baird’s skill as a 
lyricist, which is 
evident from the 
very 
beginning 
of 
the 
album. 
On the opening 
title track, Baird 
sings about the 
feeling 
that 
a 
relationship 
isn’t 
going 
to 
work 
out. 
He 
illustrates 
a 
sense 
of 
directionlessness 
and waning hope 
with lines about 
“All these long 
nights, all these 
street lights / [Bleeding] into the 
fog.” This sure-handed poeticism 
keeps up throughout the album, 
from contemplative songs like 
“I Tried” (“Everywhere I go it’s 
pouring rain / Shouldn’t have to 

hold on to try to stay sane”) to 
despairing tracks like “Burning 
Blue” (“Like the desert rain / 
Sunday silence / And the choices 
I’ve made”) and the eventual 
resolution of “Best That I Was” 
(“Silver lake skies / Make no 
reason why”).
After All brims 
with 
unbridled 
emotion, from the 
guitar-riddled, 
electric 
street-
lamp alertness of 
“Losing 
Hands” 
and “Ain’t Going 
Back to You” to the 
hurt mingled with 
resignation in “Devil Woman 
Blues.” Each song feels like its 
own pocket of a 
story, totaling a 
whole that looks 
like 
a 
dream-
fueled road trip 
around America. 
The 
effect 
of 
the songs is that 
of driving past 
familiar scenery 
and feeling like 
something about 
your relationship 
with it is shifting 
before your eyes. 
This 
changing 
vision 
is 
the 
crux of After All, 
exemplified 
in 
songs like “Give 
Me 
Back 
My 
Love,” 
which 
lands somewhere 
between a plea 
from the former 
lover 
and 
a 
desperate longing for a sense 
of love in general. When Baird 
sings, “Gonna pick me up some 
silver lining / Gonna turn these 
nickels into dimes,” and later, 
“Give me back my love,” one can’t 

help but relate to the notion of 
love itself as one’s own happiness 
and 
contentedness, 
whatever 
this might demand from another 
person.
A large part of what makes 
After All a skillful album is the 
way 
in 
which 
Baird 
uses 
raw 
emotion 
as 
a 
starting 
point, 
rather 
than 
imagery or classic 
lyrical traditions. 
Country 
music 
— which, when 
measured by its 
masters, is truly 
a vast collection of variety, 
creativity and heart — is so often 
superficially pigeonholed as a 
genre defined by dusty roads, 
dimly lit bars and pickup trucks. 
Specific images and phrases, 
in other words, that are all too 
easy to toss into a song under the 
thinly veiled guise of thoughtful 
songwriting.
But there is very little of this 
affectation in After All, as Baird 
sets himself apart from some of 
these pitfalls using a masterful 
command of poetic devices as 
he himself defines them. He still 
orients his stories — because, 
again, that is what each of the 
songs on After All is, a unified, 
emotional little story within 
itself — around traveling open 
roads and wandering empty 
streets. One gets the sense that 
this journey for which he has 
invited us along is only one of 
many he’ll take, each of which 
has its own kind of wisdom to 
impart. Amid these familiar 
landscapes, Baird writes from his 
experiences first, unconcerned 
with figures outside of the unique 
relationship he is personally 
navigating, 
wandering 
those 
empty streets as only he can.

‘After All’ is a thoughtful 
exploration of a breakup

HARD LUCK RECORDING COMPANY

‘After All’

Rob Baird

Hard Luck 
Recording 
Company

 Baird sets 
himself apart 
from some of 
these pitfalls 
using a masterful 
command of 
poetic devices 
as he himself 
defines them. 

Everywhere I have lived 
in my life, people have told 
me their state’s weather is 
uniquely unpredictable. As a 
result, I have come to think that 
weather is weird in general, and 
this principle doesn’t vary too 
much from state to state. But 
as a senior, I have now spent 
nearly four years in Ann Arbor, 
meaning 
four 
consecutive 
winters, which is the longest 
amount of consecutive winters 
I’ve really spent somewhere 
(excluding smaller visits) since 
I was very young. And of those 
four, this has to be honestly the 
strangest one yet.
When 
I 
make 
poetry 
playlists, I often try to make 
them seasonal and relatable. 
I’ve done a Halloween one, a 
Valentine’s Day one, one for the 
end of the semester. I thought 
about doing something along 
those lines for this, the first 
poetry playlist of this winter 
semester, but the weather has 
been so strange lately that it’s 
been hard to land on a unified 
theme. It was unseasonably 
warm for unseasonably long, 
and now it’s cold again. It’s 
January, and yet it feels and 
looks like late fall (or early 
spring?). If I share a bunch of 
poems focused on the cold, 
I’m almost sure it will become 
warm again instantly, and vice 

versa.
In a way, maybe this is 
appropriate. It’s a new year — 
2019! A new year is a time for 
changes, even really sudden 
ones or ones that we don’t 
immediately understand. As 
a result, I’ve decided to share 
three of my favorite poems 
that celebrate nature in all its 
seasons, and most of all that 
celebrate 
change. 
Seasonal 
changes 
are 
my 
favorite 
kind because they’re quiet, 
unsuspected and unassuming, 
very reliable (whatever we say 
about them) and often beautiful. 
This might sound cheesy, but 
it’s my final semester here, so 
I’m allowing myself to lean 
into the sentiment. Here’s to a 
new year; may we all be in the 
mindset to welcome whatever 
strangeness it brings.

“Two Seasons” by Galway 
Kinnell

Expertly straddling the line 
between fond reflection and 
self-aware, wistful presence, 
“Two Seasons” demonstrates 
Galway Kinnell’s talent for 
precision 
in 
language. 
His 
choices of words are not only 
meticulous, but also sonorous, 
with lines like “As on the low 
lake shore stood you and I” and 
“Saying you felt afraid but that 
you were / Weary of being mute 
and undefiled” contributing to 
a seamless overall portrait of 
love and mutual appreciation.

“Love’s Seasons” by Paul 
Laurence Dunbar

Paul Laurence Dunbar is a 
master of rendering the natural 
world through language, and in 
“Love’s Seasons,” he maneuvers 
through the seasons of the year 
with an interesting choice of 
order (spring, winter, summer 
and then fall), devoting a 
stanza to each. The enduring 
sentiment of the poem is one 
of sure serenity in the face of 
change, as contentedness at its 
core is deep and true in every 
season.

“Changing Of The Seasons” 
by Shel Silverstein

“Changing Of The Seasons” 
is 
peculiar 
among 
these 
selections in that it is actually 
a song. I’m including it here 
nonetheless because it is still a 
poem and beautifully written, 
and because few people can dig 
straight to the heart of a feeling, 
especially a specific feeling, like 
serenity in the face of seasonal 
change, in quite the same way 
as Shel Silverstein. Between a 
few repetitions of the line, “It’s 
blowin’ in Chicago,” Silverstein 
remarks upon the peace that 
this natural phenomenon can 
bring: “There’s some men need 
the winter and there’s some 
men need the sun / And there’s 
some men need the changing of 
the seasons.”

DAILY LITERATURE COLUMN

To be from the upper Midwest 
is to be in a kind of bemused 
purgatory. Everything you say 
sounds like a question. People 
wonder if you’re Canadian, unless 
of course you’re also from up 
north, because then you know 
how 
real 
Canadians 
sound. 
Boredom is a state of mind you’ve 
never left.
“That ’70s Show” is one of 
the 
best 
representations 
of 
Midwestern life ever aired on 
primetime television. Even the 
title operates a joke wherein, like 
the Midwest, it is not specific 
enough to convey something 
of significance, capturing the 
dismissive mirth that peppers 
our sense of humor. And out of its 
eight seasons, no episode captures 
our region’s sentiments, legends 
and troubled relationship with 
our northern neighbor as well 
as the 23rd episode of the third 
season, “Canadian Road Trip.”
Firstly, a brief apology to all 
Canadians — the Midwest only 
jests. Contrary to the numerous 
jokes made at your expense, we 
find you Canadians quaint and 
charming. We are sorry though, 
and we want you to know that if 

we were not already the laughing 
stock of the continental United 
States, we would probably go 
much easier on you. We simply 
adore you — your beavers, your 
maple syrup, your Inukshuks and 
Tim Hortons. We wouldn’t have 
you any other way, Canada. But I 
digress.
In 
the 
infamous 
episode, 
Eric 
(Topher 
Grace, 
“BlacKkKlansman”) 
and 
the 
rest of his gaggle of guys head 
to Canada for beer. A seemingly 
simple task until Fez (Wilmer 
Valderrama, “NCIS”), a foreign 
exchange student, misplaces his 
green card. The guys attempt 
to smuggle him back across the 
border, to no avail. Before they 
know it, they have been turned 
over to the Mounties.
As an upper Midwesterner, a 
trip to Canada is commonplace. 
I’ve crossed the St. Clair and 
Detroit, I’ve seen the hinterlands, 
yet everytime I’m faced with the 
same nasally clipped question: 
“What’s your business in Canada, 
eh?” Each of my experiences at 
the border have mirrored the 
experiences of Eric Forman and 
his friends — Mounties, drunk 
with power and holding baseless 
suspicions against Americans, 
making 
even 
the 
simplest 
checkpoint a production.

In fact the episode would 
be 
incomplete 
without 
the 
Mounties, who just as sternly in 
their encounters with me, grill 
Eric, Michael and Hyde on their 
attempt to smuggle Fez back into 
America. The entire exchange 
the guys have with the Mountie 
is accurate, the boys treating him 
as indifferently as someone your 
age attempting to assert an elder’s 
dominance over you.
It’s the dumb tension of the 
Canadian border — in turn 
for our uniquely Midwestern 
impertinence towards everything 
Canadian, the Canadians only 
double down on their protections 
of their country. It is the perfect 
recreation of this tension that 
makes the episode so enjoyable to 
watch time and time again.
Which brings attention to why 
these young rapscallions were in 
Canada to begin with. It can be 
summarized in the three profound 
words shouted by Michael Kelso 
(Ashton Kutcher, “The Ranch”): 
“Wooh! Canada! Beer!” If you are 
from the upper Midwest, since 
turning 19 you have likely been 
on at least one trip to Canada with 
the explicit purpose of attaining 
Canadian beer.

The Michigan women’s gymnastics team hired Rhonda Faehn as a consultant before firing Faehn four days later when U-M regents called for her termination.

Michigan brings Rhonda 
Faehn onto its gymnastics 
staff, but does not issue an
announcement. 

Faehn is spotted coaching in 
Michigan’s meet in Tuscaloosa, 
Al. The program confirms to 
The Daily that Faehn has been 
hired by the gymnastics team.

The Athletic Department an-
nounces it brought Faehn on 
as a “consultant in a coaching 
capacity.” The team website 
lists her as an assistant coach.

Michigan regents call for termi-
nation of Faehn’c contract. Hours 
later, the Athletic Department an-
nounces an end to its “consulting 
relationship” with Faehn.

I 

had 345 words of an 
empowering column about 
the Michigan women’s 
gymnastics 
team written 
on Saturday 
morning.
It all started 
when my 
roommates 
and I went to 
the Michigan 
Theatre Fri-
day night to 
see “On the 
Basis of Sex.” 
About 20 minutes before the 
movie started, an older-looking 
woman and man walked in, 
with the man wearing a Michi-
gan varsity jacket — so, natu-
rally, I pried.
“Did you play a sport at Mich-
igan?” I asked. 
“About a million years ago,” 
he chuckled. “Men’s gymnas-
tics.”
Turns out his name is Chris-
tian Vanden Broek and he com-
peted from 1965-67 — seasons 
that, he’ll tell you with a smile, 
included exhibition meets with 
international Russian teams 
that packed Crisler Center. I 
told him I’d only covered the 
men’s team once for The Daily 
but wrote about the women’s 
team pretty consistently my 
freshman year. 
He nodded his head. The 
popularity of the women’s team 
wasn’t news to him, and he 
didn’t seem to mind that. 
“Used to be the men would 
fill up Crisler — now they’re 
drawing 200 or 300 people at 
Cliff Keen while the women fill 
up Crisler.”
As I watched Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg give a flooring speech 
to a trio of judges who tried to 
mansplain the three branches 
of government to her, memories 
from The Daily’s Women’s His-
tory Month series from last year 
kept popping up. At that time, so 
many coaches and athletes were 
excited to talk about how far the 
women’s teams at Michigan had 

progressed, with gymnastics 
being one of them. 
I wanted to write a feature on 
that throughout 
the whole series. 
The women’s 
gymnastics team 
is not one of 
the best female 
teams at Michi-
gan — it’s one of 
the best teams at 
Michigan, peri-
od. After talking 
to Vanden Broek, 
I felt like I finally 
had the perfect anecdote to 
write that. 
Then I opened Twitter.
Rhonda Faehn had been hired 
as an assistant coach to replace 
Scott Vetere, who left Michigan 
after having an inappropriate 
relationship with a student-
athlete. As can be expected, 
Faehn’s position with USA Gym-
nastics over the course of the 
last three years 
— particularly 
during the Larry 
Nassar scandal 
— spurred a sig-
nificant amount 
of Twitter replies 
criticizing the 
program for its 
hire after Vetere’s 
departure.
As I switched 
between tabs of 
frustrated comments and my 
345 words of national champi-
onship titles and All-American 
women and Big Ten records, 
it felt like my column about 
women that helped emphasize 
a trend of female success in 
sports didn’t matter anymore. 
Especially after the Univer-
sity’s announcement that the 
athletic department ended its 
contract with Faehn on Sunday 
night, barely four days after 
her hire, all I could think about 
were scandalous situations that 
seemed to mar a history of suc-
cess. 
Right now, the conversa-
tion seems to be based around 

whether hiring Faehn was right 
or wrong — for me, that discus-
sion seems to miss a broader 
point. 
When you 
hear about 
scandals in 
major football 
programs like 
Ohio State or 
Penn State, you 
also hear about 
the years and 
years of storied 
success that 
accompany 
those programs. Even amid a 
domestic violence case he was 
suspended for mishandling, 
announcers praised Buckeyes 
coach Urban Meyer for battling 
through “adversity” throughout 
the scandal. 
That’s because these teams’ 
athletic successes, no matter 
how small or big, can make 
headlines for weeks, or even 
months on end, 
engraving a 
predisposed 
way of thinking 
that involves 
greatness and 
respect. It 
primes a lack of 
accountability, 
using on-field 
success as an 
excuse for off-
field, bureau-
cratic and administrative errors. 
I’m definitely not making 
the argument that the team’s 
hiring of Faehn should be 
excused because of its history 
of success — that’s a part of the 
problem with college athletic 
scandals and schools’ lack of 
accountability. But for women’s 
teams, all you hear are the con-
troversies; an assistant coach 
crosses boundaries and a hire 
was made, and suddenly a group 
of young women are forced to 
rebuild a historic reputation 
they had fight to get noticed for 
in the first place. 
Those controversies stick. 
When you Google “Ohio State 

football,” there isn’t a single 
word about domestic violence 
or Meyer mentioned anywhere 
on the first page of results just a 
few months out of the scandal. 
When you search “Michigan 
State gymnastics,” the entire 
front page, save for roster and 
schedule links, is centered 
around Nassar — completely 
scratching the program entirely.
For Michigan, the past two 
major headlines have been the 
hiring of Faehn and the firing of 
Vetere — both very important 
topics for discussion, but not 
to the point that they need to 
completely dominate the image 
of the program. Accomplish-
ments of these teams are so eas-
ily replaced with scandals, and 
unlike football programs, they 
suffer longer and harder for it.
But the women’s gymnastics 
team has done so much good 
in relation to the reputation of 
women’s sports at Michigan, 
and whether Faehn is on staff 
or not, that shouldn’t be writ-
ten off.
You’ve got coach Bev Plocki 
redeveloping an almost non-
existent team from the ground 
up. You’ve got 14 women 
who somehow manage to flip 
through the air so well that they 
went into this weekend ranked 
sixth in the nation. You’ve got 
an alum of the men’s team who 
has absolutely no problem tell-
ing you that women fill up his 
team’s old stomping ground and 
not sounding even remotely con-
tempt about it, all while waiting 
to watch a movie that chronicles 
a badass woman and her fight 
against laws that discriminate 
on the basis of sex. 
I didn’t want this column to 
be about Faehn, because I want-
ed it to be about a strong team of 
women who are advancing the 
culture of athletics at Michigan. 
If a guy in a movie theater can 
see that clearly, so can we.

(Rhonda) Faehn

The women’s 
gymnastics 
team has done 
so much good.


Mason Parris arrived in Ann 
Arbor with big shoes to fill.
After watching 2018 graduate 
Adam Coon compile a 116-15 
career record, Michigan fans 
had astronomical expectations 
for 
Parris, 
their 
freshman 
heavyweight wrestler. Standing 
at 6-foot-5 and weighing 265 
pounds, Coon was more than just 
a massive physical presence — he 
served as the icon of the program. 
His graduation left first-year coach 
Sean Bormet scrambling to replace 
the three-time All-American.
Enter Parris.
Hailing from Lawrenceburg, 
Indiana, Parris stood out as the 
gem of Bormet’s first recruiting 
class. As the top heavyweight in 
FloWrestling’s 
2018 
rankings, 
Parris headlined the fifth-best 
incoming class in the country, 
per The Open Mat. Parris’ storied 
high school career — one that 
included a trio of Indiana state 
championships 
and 
a 
206-1 
cumulative record on top of four 
honor roll appearances — drew the 
attention of powerhouse programs 
across the country.
Bormet originally planned on 
redshirting Parris this season 
to stretch his highly-anticipated 
collegiate career to an eventual 
fifth year. Most wrestlers — 
especially heavyweights — opt for 
this path under the assumption 
they’ll be more polished and 
muscular as a fifth-year senior 
than as a true freshman.
Not Parris. Bormet had no 
qualms about unleashing the 
beast.
“It’s a process we went through 
in the fall,” Bormet said. “We 
wanted to make sure we had a 
good chance to evaluate (Parris) 
physically, 
competitively 
and 
technically. 
We 
also 
wanted 
to 
measure 
what 
kind 
of 
improvement he’d make with 
each competition. We feel like he’s 
capable of reaching his goals this 
year.”
Parris has learned the jump 
from high school to college is 
massive, as are his new opponents.
“I have to adjust to wrestling 
the bigger guys,” Parris said. “I’ve 
taught myself to set up my shots 
more because I can’t just power 
through guys like I used to. Now 
that I’m wrestling guys bigger than 
me, I have to use my technique.”
When it came time to shed the 
redshirt during the team’s recent 
West Coast trip, Parris took the 
mat against the NCAA’s No. 1 
heavyweight, Oregon State’s Amar 
Dhesi. The unfamiliar venue, the 
mounting pressure of a college 
debut and a daunting matchup 
against the nation’s top-ranked 
heavyweight all pointed towards 
the likelihood of a first match to 
forget.
Rather than caving in under the 
pressure, Parris displayed poise 
and maturity beyond his years. 
He dominated the match, winning 
11-4, behind four takedowns and a 
riding-time advantage of 1:31.
“(Parris) is really confident 
in his abilities and he loves to 
compete,” Bormet said. “I can see 
he really absorbs (information) 
just from watching his mental 
adjustments from one practice to 
the next. He raises his bar pretty 
quickly.”
Parris hasn’t just raised the 
bar — he has redefined it. In his 
second match, he secured crucial 
bonus points by pinning Arizona 
State’s Brady Daniel to ignite the 
Wolverines’ 12-point comeback 
against 
the 
23rd-ranked 
Sun 
Devils.
Saturday’s match against No. 19 
Illinois’ Deuce Rachal followed a 
similar script. In his home debut, 
Parris — who entered ranked No. 
8 among heavyweights despite just 
two prior competitions — brought 
Crisler Center’s roaring crowd of 
4,026 to its feet by pinning Rachal 
with an emphatic takedown at the 
5:57 mark in the final match of 
the night. The thud of Parris’ pin 
put an resounding exclamation 
point on No. 6 Michigan’s 28-10 
victory over the Illini, moving the 
Wolverines to 6-0 on the year.
“The thing that sticks out 
about Mason most to me is that 
he’s fearless,” said redshirt junior 
Jackson Striggow. “He’s not afraid 
to let it fly out there — he tore up 
the number one kid in the nation 
with absolutely no fear. It’s really 
cool to see a kid so young be able 
to do that.”

Wolverines fall to ninth-ranked Terrapins, 83-69

Saturday afternoon in College 
Park, Md., the Michigan women’s 
basketball team faced its toughest 
opponent so far this season.
Despite putting up a fight, the 
Wolverines (11-6 
overall, 2-3 Big 
Ten) 
ultimately 
fell, 83-69, to No. 
9 Maryland (15-1 
overall, 4-1 Big 
Ten).
“So Maryland 
is 
a 
great 
basketball team — 
and especially at 
home,” Michigan 
coach Kim Barnes 
Arico told reporters after the 
game. “And I thought we matched 
up with them exceptionally well 
until late in the game.”
The first three quarters were 
even, and Michigan only trailed 
by one, 53-52, heading into the 

fourth.
In the final frame, though, the 
Terrapins took full control.
It started with a successful 
jumper from forward Stephanie 
Jones. Freshman guard Amy Dilk 
got called for a foul on the play 
and Jones capitalized with the 
ensuing 
free 
throw.
On its next 
three offensive 
possessions, 
Maryland 
converted 
a 
layup followed 
by 
3-pointers 
from 
guards 
Blair 
Watson 
and 
Taylor 
Mikesell. 
All 
the while, the Terrapins’ full-
blown defensive press hindered 
the Wolverines, fueling an 11-4 
run for Maryland.
Michigan trailed, 66-58, after 
Mikesell’s triple from the left 
wing and called a timeout. But 

in that timeout, the Wolverines 
couldn’t find an answer. Soon it 
was too late.
The 
Terrapins’ 
shooting 
success continued. They shot 
close to 77 percent from the field 
in the fourth quarter to finish 
the game 32-for-61 from the 
field. Mikesell 
and 
Watson 
led the way 
and 
finished 
with 17 and 
14 
points, 
respectively.
“We 
got 
tight 
and 
I 
think 
that 
we 
couldn’t 
get shots to 
fall,” 
Barnes 
Arico said. “We got some good 
looks. We didn’t shoot the ball 
exceptionally well. I mean, I go 
through all the stats here and 
we’re pretty much balanced in 
everything except for shooting 
percentage.”

To 
start 
the 
contest, 
Michigan’s defense came out 
hot. The Wolverines troubled 
Maryland into 10 turnovers in 
the first stanza, and this fueled a 
17-4 run to give them a 21-14 lead 
heading into the second.
But the Terrapins returned 
with an adequate 
response: 
3-pointers. 
They 
soon made three 
triples to tie the 
game at 25. Their 
ball-control 
improved too as 
they finished the 
game 
with 
just 
five 
additional 
turnovers.
“Their shooters 
had some open looks,” Barnes 
Arico said. “They made some 
great extra passes to find their 
shooters.”
Senior center Hallie Thome 
excelled for her team to keep the 
game close. Whenever she got the 

ball early on, multiple defenders 
would swarm around her to make 
things difficult. However, she 
adjusted by employing quicker 
footwork and using her strength 
to her advantage. Thome led 
Michigan in scoring (25 points) 
and rebounding (10 rebounds).
“She did a tremendous job,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Her shot 
was blocked a number of times. 
… She’s special, and Maryland’s 
defense really disrupted her but 
didn’t stop her.”
Altogether, the Wolverines 
showed their skills on the big 
stage. The defense showed a lot 
of promise and the team won 
the rebounding battle as well. 
Against a top-10 team, though, it 
wasn’t quite enough.
“They’re a tough matchup. 
Their size, their length, disrupted 
us. The way they blocked shots 
early on really disrupted us,” 
Barnes Arico said. “… But I think 
overall it was really a great 
basketball game.”

Michigan beats Illini for sixth-straight win to start season

Heavyweight 
Mason 
Parris stepped onto the 
mat Saturday with eyes 
on him.
After upsetting top-
ranked 
heavyweight 
Amar Dhesi in his first 
match since Parris shed 
his redshirt, the true 
freshman settled into 
the 
starting 
position 
with the expectations 
and intrigue of every 
person in the Crisler 
Center. But no pressure, 
weight deficit or age 
difference 
could 
stop 
Parris 
from 
pinning 
Illinois fifth-year senior 
Deuce 
Rachal 
in 
a 
decisive win.
“There’s definitely a 

huge difference between 
high school and college 
wrestling,” Parris said. 
“I was hungry to go out 
and compete and was 
excited to do it.”
Capped 
by 
Parris’ 
standout 
pin 
with 
one minute left in the 
third period, the No. 
6 Michigan wrestling 
(6-0 overall, 2-0 Big 
Ten) defeated the No. 19 
Illinois (2-2 overall, 1-1 
Big Ten), 28-10, in a meet 
of 
gritty, 
low-scoring 
losses 
and 
one-sided, 
high-scoring 
matches 
for both teams.
Starting with a tough 
loss in the 125-pound 
division, 
sophomore 
Drew 
Mattin, 
ranked 
12th in his weight class, 
fell 
to 
16th-ranked 

Travis 
Piotrowski, 
failing 
to 
deliver 
a 
single 
takedown 
for 
the Wolverines. In the 
141-pound weight class, 
redshirt 
sophomore 
Kanen Storr also fell 
short, falling 3-2 in a 
ranked matchup. Even 
with 
redshirt 
junior 
Stevan 
Micic’s 
major 
decision win in the 133-
pound 
weight 
class, 
the two ranked losses 
left 
Michigan 
losing 
4-6 
with 
momentum 
favoring Illinois.
“We weren’t getting 
enough attacks off in the 
first period and weren’t 
giving ourselves enough 
chances to score,” said 
Michigan 
coach 
Sean 
Bormet. “The pace just 
wasn’t in our favor.”

After a series of close 
losses, fifth-year senior 
Malik Amine changed 
the pace, winning 3-0 
in a defensive struggle 
at 149 pounds despite no 
takedown. Amine’s win 
made way for 157-pound 
Alec Panteleo, also a 
fifth-year 
veteran, 
to 
decisively beat Illinois’ 
Eric 
Barone, 
ranked 
two places behind him. 
Panteleo attributed his 
success 
in 
Saturday’s 
match to his discipline 
and drive to accomplish 
his goals in the program.
Adding to Panteleo’s 
success, 
redshirt 
junior 
Logan 
Massa, 
ranked seventh in his 
weight class, trounced 
16th-ranked 
Joey 
Gunther by a margin 

of 15 points, creating 
a 
technical 
fall 
and 
turning the tide toward 
the Wolverines. Massa 
and 
Panteleo’s 
wins, 
with 
a 
clean 
12-3 
performance 
in 
the 
174-pound division by 
redshirt 
junior 
Myles 
Amine, 
ranked 
third, 
upped the team score 
to 19-10 and widened 
Michigan’s 
lead 
from 
only one point to 13, an 
almost-clear sign of a 
win, even with early 
losses 
and 
redshirt 
freshman J.T. Correll’s 
defeat at 184 pounds to 
Illinois’ second-ranked 
Emery Parker. Correll 
filled in for redshirt 
freshman Jelani Embree, 
a standout early in the 
season who has been 

sidelined for weeks with 
an undisclosed injury.
To 
continue 
the 
Wolverines’ success and 
solidify their undefeated 
record, redshirt junior 
Jackson 
Striggow 
handily won his 197-
pound match, leading 
up to Parris’ debut in 
Ann Arbor. Coming out 
strong with an onslaught 
of 
takedowns 
in 
the 
first two periods, the 
freshman 
ended 
the 
first minute of the third 
up 14-3 and eventually 
pinned 
his 
opponent, 
earning 
an 
automatic 
fall, increasing the team 
score by six points and 
proving his presence as 
a college heavyweight 
even after starting the 
year as a redshirt.

Last month, the Michigan 
basketball 
team 
went 
to 
Northwestern 
and 
unexpectedly 
encountered 
its toughest challenge of the 
season, escaping with a two-
point victory. That night, the 
Wildcats found success forcing 
the Wolverines’ less-heralded 
shooters 
— 
namely 
junior 
guard Zavier Simpson — to hit 
3-pointers.
On 
Sunday, 
Northwestern 
tried to revive that strategy. 
This time, Michigan responded 
with an 80-60 victory — its 17th 
in a row to start the season, a 
new program record.
After 
the 
game, 
both 
coaches were asked what went 
differently for Simpson — and 
both came up with the same 
response.
“The ball went in.”
That was the only explanation 
necessary on Sunday night, as 
Simpson and junior center Jon 
Teske — both sub-30 percent 
3-point shooters on the season 
— went a combined 8-of-15 from 
deep.
“When you play them, you 
gotta figure out, ‘What are some 
things that you’re gonna live 
with?’ Because they space you so 
well, they’re really good at every 
position,” said Wildcats coach 
Chris Collins. “And we were 
gonna live with some Simpson 
threes and some Teske threes. 
And give those guys credit.”
The Wolverines (17-0 overall, 
6-0 Big Ten) opened the evening 
in the same fashion as they 
have throughout the season, 
using five inside baskets to open 
a quick 10-0 lead. But when 
Northwestern (10-7, 1-5) clawed 
back within two, the game 
turned weird, with Simpson 
hitting a three to break the 
mini-run.
Then, with four minutes left 

in the first half and Michigan 
protecting a 10-point lead, it 
took a turn nobody could have 
seen coming. Teske collected a 
pass from Simpson just beyond 
the 3-point line and — despite 
his 20.8 career percentage from 
deep — let go. It found bottom. 
Two 
minutes 
later, he let loose 
again, with the 
same 
result. 
So when Teske 
entered 
his 
shooting motion 
on 
Michigan’s 
next possession, 
every 
corner 
of 
a 
sold-out 
Crisler 
Center 
rose to its feet 
in 
anticipation. 
Yet 
again, 
the junior center delivered, 
putting the Wolverines up 18 
and blowing the roof off the 
building.
Teske’s last three put the 
finishing touch on a three-
minute span in which he single-
handedly outscored the listless 

Wildcats 
11-2, 
effectively 
ending any hopes they had at a 
comeback before half time.
“It was awesome,” Teske said. 
“Got the crowd going. … When 
we get a little roll like that, it’s 
kinda hard to stop.”
Teske’s 
3-point 
barrage 
helped 
extend 
Michigan’s lead 
to 50-28 before 
a sluggish start 
to 
the 
second 
period 
allowed 
Northwestern 
to 
draw 
back 
within 13 with 
10:47 
to 
play. 
But each time 
the 
Wildcats 
threatened 
to 
make it a game, the Wolverines 
responded with ease.
First, redshirt junior Charles 
Matthews 
drove 
along 
the 
baseline, emphatically dunking 
over Miller Kopp, and ending 
a nearly three-minute scoring 
drought. Then, it was Simpson’s 
turn, as he hit three deep balls 

in five minutes to stretch a 
14-point lead into a 24-point 
rout with four minutes to play.
“A 20-point lead can become 
a 13-point lead like that,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein, 
snapping his fingers. “Even 
if you get good shots, it can 
become like that. And so, if 
you have good defense, and 
you learn from those mistakes 
— and we had some mistakes — 
and don’t do it again, eventually 
they’ll miss and you’ll be able to 
go out and make them.
“And obviously, Zavier made 
all those plays. That’s where all 
our scoring was.”
And 
just 
like 
that, 
the 
Wolverines have their best start 
in program history. Beilein 
doesn’t put much weight in such 
records — when he returned to 
the locker room after Sunday’s 
game, his first move was to 
update his team’s Big Ten record 
to 6-0. Eventually, though, the 
overall record followed suit.
For the first time ever, it read, 
‘17-0.’

Simpson shoots, scores

Last month in Evanston and 
again 
Sunday 
night, 
Zavier 
Simpson watched from the bench 
as his team closed out the final 
minutes of a victory.
Back in December, it was 
a condemnation, a weakness 
that had caught up to him. 
Northwestern left the junior 
guard open for three, knowing his 
shooting numbers were low and 
hoping to clog the lane to slow the 
offense.
It worked. Simpson went 0-for-
5 from deep before being pulled 
with 6:24 remaining. Sophomore 
guard Eli Brooks ran the offense 
the rest of the way as the Michigan 
men’s basketball team pulled out a 
62-60 nail-biter.
Sunday 
was 
a 
completely 
different 
story. 
Simpson 
left 
triumphant, an affront avenged. 
He had just made his fifth trey of 
the game. The Wolverines were 
up 20 points. It was time for the 
freshmen and walk-ons to ice the 
80-60 victory.
His 3-pointer was a dagger, in 
more ways than one.
“(The first Northwestern game) 
was the first time anybody played 
that way and it sort of shocked him 
a little bit,” said Michigan coach 
John Beilein. “ … He wasn’t as 
patient and he’s such a competitor. 
He saw that as a personal affront 
to his ability.”
From the beginning, it was 
clear that the Wildcats were 
sticking with their strategy. Six-
and-a-half minutes into the game, 
Northwestern left Simpson wide 
open from beyond the arc, leaving 
everyone else blocked. And even 
though it hadn’t worked last time, 
even though the whole team had 
shot terribly in Saturday’s practice, 
Simpson did the only thing there 
was to do: shoot the ball.
Clank.
Junior center Jon Teske was 
waiting under the basket for the 
rebound. The ball came right back 
to Simpson.

Clank.
Beilein decided it was time to 
intervene.
“Settle down, now,” Beilein 
prepared to say. “You’re gonna 
shoot it when you go back in. Just 
settle down.”
Then, Simpson was open again. 
He shot again.
Swish.
The basket was called back 
due to a Wildcat foul, but it didn’t 
matter. In that moment, Beilein 
knew that Simpson was going to 
be just fine.
Thirty seconds later, Simpson 
fired again from beyond the arc.
Swish.
This time, it counted.
“I just had to keep shooting,” 
Simpson said. “Sometimes the 
ball doesn’t drop the right way. 
I felt like they was gonna do the 
strategy because it worked last 
time, so what team wouldn’t? 
Again, I just have to do the things 
I’ve been doing, which is stay 
confident.”
Northwestern kept leaving him 
open. After all, what else was there 
to do? The Wildcats were down 
big — 22 points at halftime — and 
if they put a man on Simpson, it 
would be someone else who’d run 
up the score. It had worked before, 
and Northwestern had to bet on 
regression.
For Simpson, it was a taunt. A 
dare.
He added one more three before 
halftime, then went relatively 
quiet. But he wasn’t done.
Twelve minutes into the second 
half, Simpson stole the ball off a 
bad pass and hit another three. 
Then, with four minutes left, the 
final blow. He finished with 24 
points, a career high. His 5-for-10 
from deep wasn’t just a personal 
record for makes — it was a record 
for attempts, too.
After the game, Simpson was 
asked what he was thinking out 
there on the floor. He responded 
instantly.
“Shoot another one, make it,” 
Simpson said.
“Simple as that.”

MEN’S BASKETBALL

ANNIE KLUS/Daily
Junior guard Zavier Simpson scored a career-high 24 points as Michigan beat Northwestern 80-60 on Sunday.

COLUMBUS — For a moment, 
it looked like the first goal of 
Jimmy 
Lambert’s 
Michigan 
hockey career might be a game-
winner.
The 
freshman 
forward 
capitalized on an opportunity 
while goaltender Tommy Nappier 
was out of position. He fired a shot 
from the right circle that went 
through Nappier’s legs, and the 
Wolverines (8-9-6 overall, 4-5-4-
2 Big Ten) took a 2-1 lead on No. 4 
Ohio State in the third period.
But just 28 seconds later, the 
Buckeyes (13-5-4, 6-3-3-2) tied it 
up at the other end of the ice when 
defenseman Wyatt Ege found 
twine for his first tally of the 
season. Ohio State would go on to 
win, 4-2.
“Obviously, Lambert scoring 
his first goal was awesome for 
him and it comes at a critical 
period,” said freshman forward 
Garrett van Wyhe. “(Then) they 
came back and scored next shift. 
It kind of gets everyone down, but 
we had good leadership. (Senior 
defenseman) Nick Boka trying 
to cheer us all up and stuff like 
that, stay even-keeled. Obviously, 
hockey’s kind of a game of 
mistakes, and we ended up kind of 
letting them go there.”
And just a few minutes after 
that, the Buckeyes put themselves 
in the lead on a goal from forward 
Quinn 
Preston 
that 
slipped 
through junior goaltender Hayden 
Lavigne’s pads. 
Michigan pulled Lavigne with 
just over two minutes to play and 
nearly tied the game on a shot from 
junior forward Will Lockwood 
that caught the left post of the net. 
“There’s a reason they’re one 
of the top teams in the country; 
they don’t let you get to the net 
very much,” said Michigan coach 
Mel Pearson. “I thought they did 
a good job of that all weekend. We 
really had to work hard to generate 
our scoring opportunities. Even 
tonight, with the goalie out, Will 
Lockwood has a wide-open net 
and hits the post. That’s how close 
it is.”
The opening stanza of the 

game came and went with little 
intrigue. 
Neither 
team 
truly 
threatened to score, and both 
Lavigne and Nappier held strong 
for their teams.
But in the second period, for 
the second straight night, the 
Wolverines were at a two-man 
disadvantage.
In 
Friday 
night’s 
game, 
Michigan got called for two 
penalties at the same time, 
giving the Buckeyes a two-man 
advantage. The Wolverines were 
able to kill off the entirety of both 
penalties and prevent Ohio State 
from scoring.
On Saturday, Michigan once 
again were down five-on-three 
after Boka was whistled for 
hooking and sophomore forward 
Dakota Raabe was also whistled 
for hooking 41 seconds later.
And this time, the Wolverines 
couldn’t 
stop 
the 
Buckeyes. 
Forward Tanner Laczynski fired a 
shot from just inside the left circle 
that Lavigne didn’t have a prayer 
of stopping. Just as it did Friday, 
Ohio State struck first.
“I thought we played a really 

solid game defensively,” Pearson 
said. “Had good goaltending. It 
came down to a couple breaks 
tonight a couple poor plays on our 
part, good plays on their part.”
Just over four minutes later, 
Michigan tied the game with 
its first power play goal since 
Dec. 31 against Michigan State. 
Sophomore defenseman Quinn 
Hughes slipped through the slot 
in front of Nappier and found 
Lockwood coming down the left 
wing out of the corner of his eye.
One quick pass from Hughes 
and a one-timer from Lockwood 
later, the game was even at one 
goal apiece.
The Wolverines didn’t lead the 
game until the third period, but 
it was a short-lived lead as the 
Buckeyes quickly pulled ahead 
and gained a lead they would 
not relinquish, despite how close 
Lockwood came to evening things 
up.
“I feel a little bit bad for our 
guys,” 
Pearson 
said. 
“They 
deserve better this weekend, but 
that’s sports and that’s where we 
are.”

Series Split
With their season on the line, Wolverines beat Buckeyes on Friday night, 2-1, before losing 4-2 in Saturday’s matchup

COLUMBUS 
— 
With 
an 
outstretched skate and some 
faceoff grit, freshmen defenseman 
Nick Blankenburg and forward 
Garrett Van Wyhe proved in 
Michigan hockey’s series split at 
Ohio State that they’re here to 
stay.
It’s not hyperbole to say 
that the Wolverines had their 
backs against the wall coming 
into 
this 
weekend’s 
series. 
They were missing sophomore 
forward Josh Norris due to an 
undisclosed injury, needed some 
kind of momentum after losing 
to 
52nd-ranked 
Merrimack 
and 
faced 
a 
fourth-ranked 
Buckeyes team that had 14 active 
upperclassmen but no freshmen.
Rather than folding to the 
pressure though, Michigan’s own 
freshmen were largely responsible 
for holding Ohio State to 16 fewer 
shots per game in the series than 
its season average, and putting 
pressure on an experienced blue 
line.

“We have a lot of growth,” said 
Wolverines coach Mel Pearson. “I 
mention that a lot, and I’m going 
to continue to talk about it. This 
team has a lot of room for growth, 
and I think you’re going to see it as 
the season progresses.”
Early on in Friday’s game, 
Blankenburg 
found 
himself 
sandwiched in a 2-on-1 odd-
man rush deep in the defensive 
zone, 
with 
nothing 
but 
an empty zone 
between 
him 
and 
Michigan 
goaltender 
Hayden 
Lavigne. 
Just 
minutes before, 
the Wolverines 
allowed 
Ohio 
State 
forward 
Carson 
Meyer 
to score because they committed 
too much to one player in a passing 
lane, allowing Meyer to tip in a 
goal on the ensuing pass.
As the two Ohio State players 
bounced the puck between each 
other, Blankenburg, unlike what 

Michigan did on the last goal, 
played the middle of the passing 
lane. Almost without thinking, 
the freshman intercepted the 
puck with an outstretched right 
skate. Making decisions like that 
naturally takes time for younger 
players, but perhaps that time has 
come for Blankenburg.
And in the absence of Norris, 
that time might just be here for Van 
Wyhe too. Though 
he’s 
usually 
on 
the 
Wolverines’ 
fourth line, he’s 
found a niche as 
one of Michigan’s 
best players for 
faceoffs and hasn’t 
been someone that 
the Buckeyes and 
opposing 
teams 
can 
dismiss 
for 
his 
linemates. 
Van Wyhe’s seven shots on goal 
this series — many of which were 
inches from finding the back of the 
net — and his 16-28 line on faceoffs 
showcase his current ability.
“How good is he?” Pearson 
said with a touch of excitement. 
“He’s really matured. I mean, 
he’s coming into his own this 
second half. He had a couple good 
scoring chances and he’s going 
to score some goals. We have the 
confidence as a staff to play him 
against anybody. Team’s top lines, 
no issue, he’s over the boards. 
That’s quite a feat for a young 
player.”
For Michigan to return to last 
year’s form, relying on players like 
Van Wyhe and Blankenburg, not 
to mention freshman goaltender 
Strauss Mann, has become the 
norm as opposed to the exception. 
They don’t need to be Norris or 
sophomore defenseman Quinn 
Hughes right away, but as Pearson 
said, it’s important that the team 
can trust the freshmen against 
any line in any arena.
“When they’re juniors and 
seniors, they’ll be like some of their 
guys who are juniors and seniors. 
And that’s another thing. We 
came and played against a whole 
different stronger, experienced 
team, and I thought we held our 
own … that’s encouraging going 
forward.”
