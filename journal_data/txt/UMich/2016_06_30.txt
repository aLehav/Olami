Faculty and students discuss factors that 
contribute to Engineering’s achievements

Increase driven by 
growing number 
of out-of-state 
applications

By BRIAN KUANG

Summer Daily News Editor

The University of Michigan 

expects to yield a freshman class 
size of 6,600 for the class of 2020 

— an increase of about 500 from 
the class of 2019 — potentially 
making it the largest freshman 
class in University history and a 
reflection of the rapid growth in 
applicants to the University since 
2010. 

After enrolling 6,505 freshmen 

in 2014 — overshooting a target 
class size of 6,000 — administrators 
expressed 
frustration 
that 

over-enrollment 
was 
straining 

the 
University’s 
housing 
and 

instructional resources. To combat 

this over-enrollment, admissions 
procedures were changed for the 
subsequent freshman class by 
reducing early admission offers 
and making greater use of the 
waitlist. As a result, only 6,071 
freshmen entered campus in 2015.

For 
the 
2015-16 
admission 

cycle, 55,500 students applied 
for admission to the University, 
a 6.7 percent increase from the 
previous year. Of those who 
applied, 16,100 were admitted for 
an acceptance rate of 29 percent, 

and the University estimates 6,600 
freshman will be on campus come 
September — a yield rate of 41 
percent. This represents a three-
point increase in the University’s 
acceptance rate over the past 
admissions cycle and a four-point 
decline in its yield.

Also of note was the disparity 

between in-state and out-of-state 
acceptance rates. Of the 10,959 
Michigan residents who applied 
for admission, 42.2 percent were

Daily Staff Reporter

In fall 2015, private gifts to the 

University of Michigan College of 
Engineering totaled nearly $46.5 

million.

Nearly all of the 12 College 

of 
Engineering’s 
departments 

ranked in the top ten engineering 
departments 
in 
the 
country, 

according to U.S. News and World 
Report.

And 
while 
the 
University 

itself has an acceptance rate 
of 26.2 percent, the College of 
Engineering’s 
acceptance 
rate 

for fall 2015 was 24 percent — 
providing the 13,461 first-year 
applicants a less than one-in-four 

chance of acceptance.

These extensive private funds, 

consistent 
nationwide 
and 

international rankings, and low 
acceptance rates are the tip of 
the iceberg for the University’s 
College of Engineering.

With 397 total tenured and 

tenure-track 
faculty, 
6,351 

undergraduate students and 1,742 
graduate students, the College of 
Engineering has topped ranking 
lists since its establishment in 
1854, including being ranked the 

sixth-best engineering school in 
the United States by U.S. News 
and World Report.

Twelve departments and 17 

undergraduate 
programs 
of 

study — 14 of which have received 
specialized 
accreditation 
by 

the 
Accreditation 
Board 
for 

Engineering 
and 
Technology 

— are clearly part of what 
distinguishes 
the 
engineering 

school from hundreds in the 
country. But what else helps it

Teams spent 

weekend developing 
solutions to global 
healthcare problems

By ALEX COTT

For the Daily

The first annual Ann Arbor 

Health 
Hackathon 
brought 

together 
medical 
professionals, 

software 
engineers, 
public 

health workers among others to 
brainstorm solutions to global 
healthcare problems from Friday 
to Saturday in Palmer Commons.

The “hackathon” included 24 

hours of health-related “hacking,” 
which involved teams pitching 
ideas 
and 
creating 
prototypes 

for solutions to health problems. 
The event focused on preventing 
disease in underserved areas of the 
developing world.

The hackathon was created 

and operated by Beatrix Balogh, a 
research associate for the William 
Davidson Institute, an independent 
non-profit that provides emerging 
market solutions; Britt Johnson, 
a consultant at Integral Chain; 
Diane 
Bouis, 
the 
innovation 

programs director at The Inovo 
Group, an innovation consulting 
firm; and Neelima Ramaraju, the 
global health applications director 
at LLamasoft, a supply chain 
management software company.

Though 
there 
are 
other 

hackathons in Ann Arbor, the 
four co-founders wanted to create 
something different to engage a 
more diverse crowd. 

“We wanted it to be free and 

available 
to 
the 
community,” 

Johnson 
said. 
“Many 
other 

hackathons are focused on the 
University, and coming in as a 
working professional, it’s cool to 
see all of the people working in 
startups in health and software. 
There’s just such a variety.”

The 
co-founders 
brought 

together their past experiences 
to create a health hackathon that 
encompassed the most successful 
practices from other events.

“I participated in hackathons 

at MIT in Boston and again in 
Cleveland,” Johnson said. “I just 
loved how it brought so many 
different experts together in one 
room at one table that generally 
don’t have the chance to meet and 
talk. I liked the idea of starting 
with a problem and thinking 
through a solution with a group of 
people.”

Johnson added that sometimes 

real products have developed 
from hackathons.

Johnson said organizers had 

two goals: uncovering new ideas 
and uniting the community.

“Our goals are two-fold: to 

bring innovative thought and 
new design and solutions into 
a space where there have been 
a lot of traditions,” Johnson 
said. “The second is more local: 
bringing those diverse parts of 
our community together to talk 
and work on it and get to know 
each other.”

The 
event 
commenced 

Friday evening for participants 
to meet and exchange ideas. 
Saturday morning began with 
three keynote speakers — Eden 
Wells, Mark Wilson, and Hamid 
Ghanbari — who discussed how 
multifaceted nature of global 
health issues.

“(Ghanbari) was my favorite,” 

rising LSA senior Jenny Tou, a 
participant in the hackathon, 
said. “He talked about global 

health and how multidimensional 
it is. Sometimes the problems 
intertwine so if you solve one, then 
you solve others as well.”

Once the hacking began, 91 

participants 
were 
faced 
with 

the challenge of creating a basic 
product or prototype in 24 hours to 
crack a disease prevention problem. 
Seventeen teams, ranging from one 
to seven members, each chose a 
pitched idea to work on during the 
event.

Johnson said many pitched ideas 

covered hugely problematic issues 
in healthcare, health habits and 
disease and cultures.

The teams worked with a wide 

variety of ideas, including a website 
to inform the local residents about 
the 
three-mile-long 
dioxane 

plume in Ann Arbor and how 
clean the water sources are, an 
app that simplified the language 
in insurance policies for people to 
better comprehend, and a paper 
diagnostic strip for cardiovascular 
disease and other key diseases for 
developing countries and rural 
areas.

Johnson said the organizers 

aimed to have diverse participants, 
including the students.

“We tried to get a big mix of 

participants,” Johnson said. “We 
were really looking for people in 
health, software and tech. We 
wanted a mix of ages that pulled 
from different backgrounds, like 
working professionals as well as 
the student population.”

Tou’s team worked on a program 

that created a physical therapy

“Ban the Box” may 
lead to increases
in discrimination

Reps. criticize congressional 
inaction on gun regulations

Study shows Black 
applicants had fewer 

callbacks after 

legislation

By MEHRUNISA KHAN

Daily Staff Reporter

A 
University 
of 
Michigan 

research study shows that “Ban 
the Box” legislation may lead to an 
increase in racial discrimination by 
employers.

“Ban the Box” refers to a push 

for 
the 
removal 
of 
questions 

concerning criminal history on 
job applications, making it easier 
for former convicts to receive 
initial interviews. “Ban the Box” 
does not prevent employers from 
eventually 
running 
background 

checks. 
Rather, 
the 
legislation 

aims to provide applicants with the 
opportunity to prove their abilities 
and impress employers in hopes of 
gaining the chance to re-enter the 
community. 

According the Ban the Box 

Campaign website, more than 45 
cities and countries and seven 
states have adopted the policy to 
reduce employment discrimination 
based 
on 
criminal 
records. 

Last 
year, 
President 
Obama 

encouraged “banning the box” 
forfederal employment. Ann Arbor 
unanimously voted for this hiring 
policy for city employment in 2014.

Sonja Starr — a University law 

professor 
who 
conducted 
the 

study with Princeton University 
economist Amanda Agan — said she 
believed it was important to look 
into the legislation’s effects, as the 
law spreads across the nation.

The study focused on racial 

discrimination, as one of the 
main arguments for Ban the Box 
legislation is the policy would 
increase access to jobs for people of 
color, especially young Black men.

“Black men in particular face 

high levels of unemployment, and 
it is often said that one reason 
for that is that Black men are 
disproportionately likely to have 
criminal records, and employers 

are too unwilling to hire people 
with records,” Starr said.

LSA junior Emma Ward, a head 

research assistant, said she and a 
large team of student researchers 
sent fictitious job applications in 
New York and New Jersey before 
and after Ban the Box laws were 
in place. Research assistants were 
given a group of cities and a fake 
applicant’s 
name, 
race, 
profile 

number and business to which each 
application would go. The profiles 
were sent in pairs: one Black and 
white applicant, and one with 
a criminal background and one 
without.

Starr said the researchers kept 

all applications identical except 
for specific traits, such as the 
applicant’s criminal record and 
race. All of the applicants were 
male.

Results showed there was an 

increase in racial discrimination 
towards Black men.

“It’s mixed news for Ban the 

Box,” Starr said. “On one hand, we 
found that it was true that criminal 
records were a huge obstacle to 
getting jobs. And companies do 
comply with Ban the Box so that 
obstacle for the initial callback 
stage disappears after Ban the Box 
goes into effect. On the other hand, 
there was a very large increase in 
racial discrimination after Ban the 
Box went into effect.”

Before Ban the Box, White male 

applicants had 7 percent more 
callbacks than Black applicants. 
After Ban the Box, this gap 
increased to 45 percent.

Starr said the consequences were 

unintended, since Ban the Box was 
meant for people of color to pass the 
initial stage of employment.

“BTB is often presented as 

a way of increasing Black male 
employment, but most Black men 
do not have criminal convictions, 
and BTB risks harming Black men 
without records by preventing 
them from signaling that fact to 
employers,” the research study 
stated.

The researchers believe that 

statistical discrimination was in 
effect, meaning employers use 

Mich. lawmakers 
call for background 
checks, limits based 

on No-Fly List 

By RIYAH BASHA

Summer Daily News Editor

A 
panel 
of 
representatives 

from 
Michigan’s 
congressional 

delegation and state organizers 
gathered Wednesday afternoon 
to call for gun control legislation 
— namely universal background 
checks and the “No Fly, No 
Buy” 
measure 
that 
prevents 

individuals 
on 
the 
Federal 

Bureua of Investigation’s No-Fly 
List from purchasing firearms. 
Representatives 
John 
Conyers 

(D–Detroit), Debbie Dingell (D–
Dearborn), Dan Kildee (D–Flint), 
Brenda Lawrence (D–Southfield) 
and Sander Levin (D–Royal Oak) 
— who all participated in House 
Democrats’ daylong sit-in last 
week 
to 
protest 
Republicans’ 

refusal to vote on gun control bills 
— slammed congressional inaction 
and promised to follow up their 
protest with more public pressure.

The standing-room-only event 

took place in Berkeley, Michigan, 
as part of a national day of 
action promoted by Democratic 

lawmakers to curb gun violence. 
More than 50 people attended, and 
although a majority of the audience 
included 
members 
of 
state 

advocacy groups such as Moms 
Demand Action and Million Moms 
Against Gun Violence, a handful 
of 
National 
Rifle 
Association 

members also attended and vocally 
criticized the panel.

The representatives heralded 

last week’s sit-in as a significant 
action that swayed public opinion. 
Lawrence 
emphasized 
the 

importance of acts of protest and 
marked gun violence as a public 
health crisis.

“There has not been change 

in this country without civil 
disobedience, ” Lawrence said. 
“We are coming home almost to 
a hero’s welcome (and) we finally 
said enough. Guns are being used 
to take lives every day. This is 
common sense … this is not a move 
to take away guns from any law-
abiding citizen.”

Conyers, the most senior U.S. 

representative, went further to 
say that all assault rifles must be 
banned. He was met with both 
loud cheers and boos.

Dingell revisited her emotional 

speech from the House floor last 
week and said difficult memories 
of domestic violence propelled her 
to act.

“This is not an easy subject 

for me, and I haven’t slept much 
since last Wednesday,” she said. 
“But it’s my story too. If we can 
keep anybody from experiencing 
gun violence, we have a moral 
responsibility to do so.

Other 
community 
leaders 

sat on the panel as well — law 
enforcement representatives and 
members of SafeHouse, Crime 
Stoppers, Equality Michigan and 
local mosques weighed in on the 
importance of gun control, though 
some had varying opinions on the 
bills at hand. Dearborn Heights 
Imam 
Mohammad 
Ali 
Elahi 

questioned the reliability of the 
No-Fly List as an extrajudicial tool.

“If the watchlist has some 

innocents on it, then that is 
injustice,” he said.

Dingell and Lawrence addressed 

concerns about using the No-Fly 
List, marking it as a starting point 
for further legislation proposals.

“If someone’s on the No-Fly List 

erroneously … there’s a process for 
us to mitigate through that,” she 
said. “Let’s talk through that. How 
can we legislate if you don’t bring 
the bill forward?” 

Nathan 
Triplett, 
Equality 

Michigan’s 
political 
director, 

underscored the urgency of anti-
LGBTQ violence, especially in light 
of the Orlando shootings earlier 
this month. During the shooting,

ntimate partner violence is 
an issue that has long been 
kept in the shadows of law 

and media; it 
wasn’t 
until 

1994 
that 

the 
Violence 

Against 
Women Act was passed, and it 
was discussed as only a public 
health concern as late as the 
‘70s. Only then did shelters for 
abused women begin to open in 
the United States, and laws were 
passed to protect the rights of 
abused women and children. 
Though well-meaning, these laws 
and shelters often exclude non-
heteronormative 
individuals, 

people who don’t fall on the two-
gender binary, as well as men who 
have been abused, showing that 
there is a long way for our society 
to go before we fully understand 
and face the issues surrounding 
intimate 
partner 
violence. 

Although 
intimate 
partner 

violence has been a crime that has 
existed probably as long as the 
nuclear family and the patriarchy 
itself, only recently have the well-
being for members of this type of 
family been discussed in an open 
atmosphere.

The immaturity that is often the 

response to the issues of intimate 
partner violence has been quite 
apparent in the face of Amber 
Heard’s allegations against her 
soon-to-be ex-husband Johnny 
Depp. Soon after her allegations 
were announced to the public, she 
was being called a whore who was 
trying to steal Depp’s money as 
well as ruin his reputation, with 
the money that she was asking 
for used as evidence. In addition, 
Depp’s former partner, as well 
as his daughter, came forward 
to state that Depp has been, and 
always will be, a kind and gentle 
person, 
incapable 
of 
hurting 

anyone. The articles detailing 
Vanessa Paradis and Lily-Rose 

Depp’s words have been used to 
besmirch 
Heard’s 
allegations, 

as evidence that seems to state, 
“If one woman in a man’s life is 
abused, then all women in this 
man’s life must have been abused.”

The most glaring form of 

misunderstanding 
is, 
in 
my 

opinion, in the form of the 
accusations of wishing to ruin 
Depp and take his money that 
have been thrown at Heard. 
In the form of comments on 
Facebook, Youtube and Twitter, 
as well as in an op-ed written by 
a friend of Depp’s, Heard has been 
accused of being a gold digger and 
a manipulator. I am not stating 
that there has never been a false 
accusation of domestic violence, 
but statistics show that intimate 
partner violence occurs at an 
alarming rate. So why did we, as 
a society, decide that a majority 
of those who accuse others of 
domestic violence are doing so out 
of spite, and that in turn accusing 
these people of being scheming 
and devious is an appropriate 
response? Specific to the Heard 
and Depp case, Depp has long 
been considered one of the most 
prolific actors in Hollywood, as 
well as a likeable — albeit strange 
— personality. For my generation, 
he is a huge part of our childhoods, 
having played the memorable 
Captain Jack Sparrow in all of 
the “Pirates of the Caribbean” 
movies. Amber Heard, in going 
forward with her allegations, was 
setting herself up to be vilified 
and minimized by the media and 
the American public for daring 
to accuse a man with so much 
respect and power. She has been 
accused of trying to ruin Depp’s 
reputation, but, by watching the 
events that have transpired since 
her accusations have come to 
light, it becomes obvious that the 
only person whose reputation is 
being ruined is Heard’s herself. 
We must ask ourselves: When 

was the last time allegations of 
domestic abuse really ruined 
someone’s career? If ruining Depp 
were Heard’s goal, wouldn’t she 
be doing this all wrong?

Looking at Depp’s previous 

relationships with women as a 
way of claiming Heard’s deceit 
is 
also 
problematic, 
as 
this 

perspective fails to understand 
how 
different 
circumstances 

can affect this situation. Vanessa 
Paradis, Depp’s partner for over 
a decade, wrote a letter stating, 
“These recent allegations being 
made are outrageous.” Depp’s 
first wife, Lori Anne Allison, 
has apparently told friends that 
Depp is incapable of hurting 
anyone. I’m not doubting the 
words of these women, but I do 
doubt that they completely, 100 
percent understood Depp and 
his inclination toward violence, 
in spite of being in an intimate 
relationship with him. I find it 
hard to believe that any person 
can fully understand another 
enough to say that they would 
never do anything. Not only that, 
but Heard is 22 years younger 
than Depp and bisexual. Though 
both 
were 
adults 
when 
the 

relationship began, 22 years is 
still a big difference, and it could 
have affected the way Depp 
viewed his wife. And, as a bisexual 
woman, Heard was already twice 
as likely to be abused as a straight 
woman. Heard’s bisexuality has 
already been a source of gossip 
for the tabloids, some claiming 
that this was the reason Depp 
initially became angry with her. 
I don’t wish to imply that Depp’s 
former partners are liars, I only 
wish to argue that there is no 
way that these women completely 
understood their former lover, 
or his relationship with Heard, 
and that their words shouldn’t be 
taken as solid evidence of Depp’s 
innocence.

People have been really quick to

Be safe around water

A disturbing reaction to domestic violence

ELENA 
HUBBELL

vilify Heard, pointing out the fact 
that when she originally called 
the police to her home on May 
21, they saw no evidence to file 
a report. But Heard was granted 
a restraining order, and recently 
text messages have surfaced that 
appear to corroborate Heard’s 
claims that Depp abused her on 
multiple occasions over a period 
of time. She did everything 
right, she took all of the steps 
necessary, but she is still being 
accused of lying. Will we ever 
really know the answers to what 
happened in this relationship? 
Perhaps not, and as people who 
have zero personal connections 
to either of these actors, maybe 

that’s for the best. We won’t be 
the ones to decide the truth, but 
we can decide how we react to 
these accusations. Immediately 
assuming that when someone 
wealthy 
and 
respected 
is 

accused of abusing another, that 
the person accusing is being 
manipulative is only a show of 
misunderstanding 
in 
regards 

to intimate partner violence. 
We need to change our attitude 
toward intimate partner violence 
— we need to begin understanding 
this issue more, and rely less on 
outdated stereotypes.

his 
summer, 
the 

abnormally 
warm 

weather 
will 
drive 

thousands of Michiganders to one 
of our favorite 
pastimes. 
Being 
the 
Great 

Lakes 
State, 

swimming and water recreation 
is an understandably popular 
way to cool off and stay active 
this summer. With more than 
3,200 miles of coastline and over 
11,000 inland lakes, Michigan is 
a swimmer’s paradise.

The 
downfall 
of 
this 

abundance of water is the threat 
of drowning and other water 
emergencies. 
This 
summer, 

more than 10 people a day will 
die of drowning in the United 
States, totaling more than 3,500 
drowning fatalities each year. 
Drowning is the leading cause 
of accidental death in children 
under the age of four, and all 
of these deaths are completely 
preventable.

Drowning is so deadly that 

it 
outflanks 
choking, 
house 

fires and falls as a cause of 
death. However, there is very 
little in the way of preventing 
drowning on a large scale. While 
drowning 
primarily 
affects 

children, anyone can be a victim 
of 
drowning. 
Many 
people 

think that by simply knowing 
how to swim, they can avoid 
the consequences of poor water 
safety. This could be no further 
than the truth.

The 
strange 
thing 
about 

drowning is that not many people 
know what the signs of drowning 
are. Movies and TV have trained 

us to think that a drowning 
person will be splashing around 
and yelling for help. In reality, 
a drowning person may silently 
slip below the surface of the 
water and die within minutes.

To combat drowning as a 

national epidemic, every person 
who is around water must be 
vigilant 
and 
knowledgeable 

about safety. Children should 
always 
be 
watched 
around 

water and should be rescued at 
the first sign of trouble. People 
who don’t know how to swim 
should be in a coast guard-
approved lifejacket and proper 
precautions should always be 
taken. Swimmers should always 
swim near a lifeguard, and if that 
isn’t possible, someone should 
be watching from outside of the 
water. Additionally, alcohol and 
swimming should never mix, 
and children should never be left 
alone near water.

I know that thousands of 

University of Michigan students 
will be near water this summer, 
and many will be responsible for 
small children as well. Being safe 
around water doesn’t necessarily 
involve 
getting 
a 
lifeguard 

certification or paying lots of 
money to go to a well-guarded 
waterpark. Water safety starts 
with one responsible person 
and that person can prevent a 
drowning before it happens.

So this summer, please pay 

attention near water. You will 
play a huge role in limiting the 
3,500 drownings a year and may 
keep a loved one alive.

I 

used to be able to sit down and 
read, uninterrupted, for hours. 
Same with movies and award 

shows — I would 
intently observe, 
connect 
with 

the 
material 

and 
try 
my 

hardest to remember why I liked 
it so I could tell my friends later. As 
I began to become more and more 
captivated by social media and 
technology, this ability waned. I 
found myself anxious to tweet my 
thoughts during a live television 
event, Snapchat the best songs at a 
concert and take a good selfie for 
Instagram. I couldn’t give myself 
the freedom to simply watch, listen 
and live without the anticipation 
of 
critiquing, 
documenting 
or 

interrogating the experiences I 
had. This isn’t always a bad thing — 
nearly every course you can take on 
literature and rhetoric highlights 
the 
importance 
of 
continued, 

rigorous engagement with media 
and experiences. The omnipresence 
of technology has definitely enabled 
a stronger culture of critical thinking 
when it comes to certain events 
and trends (think: the response to 
Beyonce’s 
Lemonade, 
plethoras 

of television recaps, thinkpieces, 
etc.). However, I sometimes miss 
the days of prolonged and directed 
focus. I am starting to miss having a 
real attention span. I’m working on 
improving my focus, but while it’s 
still on shaky ground, I thought I’d 
share some things I’ve noticed about 
myself and others grappling with 
this dilemma.
1. Instagram > Facebook.

Facebook is the place you go to 

announce a life update requiring 
major 
verbal 
explanation. 
It’s 

for reaching out to your parents, 
grandparents and acquaintances. 
And you definitely never read 
through each post. Who has time for 
that? Instagram, however, is home 
to your closest friends (especially 
if you have a finsta), and the norms 
dictate roughly one photo posted 
per day with a quirky one-sentence 
caption. It’s easy to reach the end 
of your feed when you only need to 
glance at a picture and double-tap 
it to acknowledge its presence was 
felt, before sending it away with a 

flick of your thumb. It just makes 
more sense this way — you’re less 
formal, cringeworthy puns are the 
best captions, and comments are 
short bursts of love for your friends 
and their photogenic lives. It’s more 
authentic. And it takes less time — 
gotta keep that battery life lasting 
all day!
2. Snapchat is king.

Texting can be a lot of work. Again, 

you’re thrust into the rigidity of 
language and emojis — and those can 
only express so much. But a picture 
tells 1,000 words, without the tedium 
of typing out and then reading all of 
those words. And a picture with the 
dog filter superimposed on it says 
even more.
3. Video chatting and live video 
are great. 

Again, typing and reading are 

super difficult for those of us 
suffering from shrinking attention 
spans. FaceTiming or Skyping a 
friend saves you the time and is also 
spontaneous — you don’t have to 
dedicate time later to read through a 
feed, a backlog of texts or even open 
a set of Snapchats. It’s all happening 
live. Live video is also popular 
on social media, and from live-
streaming sports and political events 
like the recent gun safety sit-in, it’s a 
new form of journalism. It’s a form of 
journalism that you can actually sit 
through — because it’s going on right 
then, right from your phone.
4. Binge-watching is the only way 
of life.

Netflix 
changed 
the 
game 

with streaming television shows, 
and even more so when it began 
releasing its own content that was 
designed for binge-viewing. We 
collectively realized that scheduling 
time and pacing ourselves to get 
through a story was a waste. Plus, 
it’s hard to remember every detail 
packed into a show when it runs 
the course of an entire year. Just get 
all of your watching over and done 
with — so you can Snapchat your 
friends about it. 
5. You sign up for online learning 
and never learn.

There are so many incredible 

resources for learning new skills, 
from computer programming to 
history, just the tap of a button 
away. And your résumé, and your 

intellectual curiosity, could use some 
of that. But no matter how many 
Codecademy-esque sites you see 
or how many Coursera e-mails you 
get, you cannot ever actually stick 
to the plan. I mean sure, reviewing 
JavaScript was cool last week, but 
you’re busy and this Instagram 
caption won’t write itself.
6. You think you’re immune to 
clickbait …

An article with a buzzy headline 

will pop up online, and you will see 
right through it, patting yourself on 
the back for not getting sucked into 
the trap. Then it happens. “5 Easy 
Guacamole Recipes That Changed 
My Life.” Before you realize it, you 
are eating chips and guac and an 
hour has passed, you have nine tabs 
open and you’re seven items into a 
separate list regarding the middle 
names of each of the 101 Dalmatians.
7. You wish TL;DR existed for 
everything. 

Paragraphs are daunting. The 

written word, from textbooks to 
text messages, from e-books to 
e-mails, could use a one sentence 
summary of key points. Teachers 
always used to say show, don’t 
tell. But when you can see any 
image in the entire world from a 
few keystrokes, it’s better to just 
tell. Too Long; Didn’t Read is 
the epitome of casual, everyday 
shortened attention spans.
8. Listicles are your best friend!

Few things are as ubiquitous on 

the Internet than the Buzzfeed-
style 
listicle. 
Sassy 
headlines, 

brief 
bullets, 
animated 
GIFs 

and copywriting that reads like 
an advertisement all abound in 
listicles. But they are quick to 
read and so relatable! They can 
be effective in communicating a 
brief point, explaining a concept 
or providing entertainment value. 
Listicles are the most salient feature 
of the modern Internet, and they 
show no sign of slowing down yet. 
It’s hard to keep people engaged in 
an article whose point is to engage 
with their own lack of engagement, 
and even harder to do so if that 
article is long with traditional 
paragraphs and blocky text boxes.

 How to live with a short attention span

Ensuring ethics in autonomy

EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBERS

I

magine: You step into your car 
and punch in the address of your 
destination. The motor hums to 

life, the wheels 
begin to turn, 
but you aren’t 
steering. Instead 
you can relax, 
queue up some music, use both hands 
to eat, talk on the phone or simply have a 
snooze. Driverless cars, or autonomous 
vehicles (AVs, as they’re called in the 
industry), look to be the inevitable 
direction of motor transportation. 
The University of Michigan agrees 
— just look to its recently-built mock-
cityscape, which engineers are using 
now to test AVs onsite.

Many have been wondering when 

AVs will ever become a fixture in 
our way of life. I can’t speak to that 
personally, but I’ve become intrigued 
by the ethical questions about AVs 
that are now starting to disseminate 
through conversations: In the chance 
a fast-moving AV bears down on 
oblivious pedestrians in the road, 
should it maneuver to avoid them 
while putting the passenger at risk for 
collision with a fixed object (like a wall) 
or even somebody walking responsibly 
on the sidewalk? Or should it prioritize 
the wellbeing of the passenger, 
sacrificing that of the pedestrians? AVs 
are little more than robots with wheels. 
They will be programmed to have to 
make such calls.

The 
development 
of 
AVs 

has 
triggered 
unprecedented 

collaborations between expertise in 
the tech and automotive spheres, most 
notably that between Fiat Chrysler 
Automobiles and Google. In such a 
joint venture, we can imagine that 
while automotive engineers style 
and design safety mechanisms for 
AVs, programmers will design the 
algorithms that AVs employ to navigate 
and make split-second decisions. 
The programmer would therefore 
consciously write in the car’s software 
which maneuver to take for situations 
when 
collisions 
are 
unavoidable, 

but the course of action differently 
affects the lives of those involved. This 
decision-making process would be 
made known to consumers. Without 
regulations in place, consumers could 
hypothetically choose between an AV 
software package that prioritizes the 
safety of the passenger (themselves) 
and a package that prioritizes the 
safety of the greatest number of people 
(including those outside the car).

Researchers recently surveyed 

U.S. 
residents 
about 
their 

sentiments 
regarding 
such 
a 

dilemma. One opinion held a clear 
majority. Seventy-six percent of 

the respondents believed that the 
car should maneuver to harm the 
fewest number of people, even if 
the passenger was not among that 
number. Perhaps it suggests that 
we generally have equal respect 
for all human life and wellbeing, 
a utilitarian and pleasant notion. 
But the situation changes when we 
consider purchasing a car ourselves. 
While a strong majority felt that 
AVs should minimize harm across 
everyone, a majority were not 
supportive of regulations requiring 
such algorithms in AVs, likely 
preferring to have the option to 
purchase self-protecting cars. Such 
offerings would create a completely 
different preference: who would 
buy a utilitarian car knowing others 
could be purchasing self-protecting 
ones? The enthusiasm to protect the 
common good breaks down.

A couple things have become 

clear. We already believe that AVs of 
any type will save lives by preventing 
user 
error-triggered 
collisions 

compared to human-driven vehicles. 
And for everyone to begin adopting 
utilitarian AVs, regulations will 
be needed. This in turn will slow 
adoption of such cars, however, 
as consumers remain concerned 
about their own wellbeing when 
using them. As a result, more lives 
may not be saved during the slower 
transition to utilitarian cars than if 
self-protecting cars were allowed, 
and more quickly adopted.

We will need to learn even more 

about consumer opinion about a 
variety of specific ethical dilemmas 
concerning AVs of this sort before 
such decisions are made. But with the 
data we have, it seems like a two-stage 
adoption would make the most sense. 
Early on, regulating cars to protect 
the passenger would suffice to ensure 
quick adoption of this new mode of 
transportation. Perhaps 20 to 30 years 
afterward, or however long it takes for 
driverless cars to become widespread 
in the United States, the policy could 
switch to a utilitarian one, ensuring 
the greatest preservation of life for time 
to come, after the consumer psyche 
has gained comfort with using such 
vehicles.

I don’t put this forward as an expert, 

just a curious citizen. But this is about 
more than a thought experiment. 
Engineers 
aren’t 
perfect. 
When 

millions of AVs eventually hit the 
road, we’ll see their shortcomings. We 
should be considerate about the ones 
we can control.

TV REVIEW

‘Lobster’ absurd

By SOPHIA KAUFMAN

Daily Arts Writer

Single guests staying at the 

hotel depicted in “The Lobster” 
have three options: They can try 
to find a life part-
ner 
within 
45 

days, run away 
to the city and 
try to survive as 
a part of a sham 
relationship 
or 

on 
their 
own, 

or live as Lon-
ers in the forest. 
The second two 
options are dan-
gerous and lead to violent pun-
ishment. But anyone who fails in 
their endeavors in the first option 
is turned — literally transformed 
(this is not a metaphor) — into an 
animal.

The film’s protagonist, David 

(Colin Farrell, “Winter’s Tale”), 
is packed off to the hotel after 
his divorce, with his brother (a 
dog) at his knees. He soon learns 
the bizarre workings of the hotel. 
Masturbation is illegal and pun-
ishable, but male guests are sexu-
ally stimulated by a hotel maid as 
it makes finding a mate easier — 
there’s no indication that women 
are given the same treatment, but 
whether that stems from a lack 
of recognition of female desire or 
something else is up to the viewer.

Couples are most believable if 

they have a distinct trait in com-
mon, like a propensity for random 
nosebleeds. So when faced with a 
looming countdown to a transfor-
mation, guests get creative in their 
attempts to hasten a match with 
each other. Desperate deception 
abounds.

Other than faking a good match, 

there is only one way for them to 
put off the date of their transfor-
mation. Every guest at the hotel 
is given a tranquilizer gun and 
sent into the forest to try to cap-

ture Loners; for each Loner that 
a guest captures, they receive an 
extra day to find if not true love, 
something that will convince the 
miserable but powerful patrons of 
the hotel.

David casts his lot in with the 

Loners, and his life is then shaped 
by two different women. The 
leader (Léa Seydoux, “Blue is the 
Warmest Color”) is shrewd and 
unforgiving; she allows mastur-
bation but no romantic or erotic 
attachments. The other, the Short 
Sighted Woman, (Rachel Weisz, 
“The Constant Gardener”) is the 
only person in the film who seems 
capable of true lightness and 
laughter. She’s drawn to David, 
and he to her, but they tread care-
fully — until they don’t, and are 
punished by the Loner Leader. 
While Farrell and Weisz stand 
out in how well matched they are, 
their acting styles offsetting each 
other perfectly, the rest of the cast 
strongly supports them.

The characters in “The Lob-

ster” would seem brain-washed if 
it weren’t for the flickers of color 
that sporadically stab through 
the bleak gray fabric of the film. 
If happiness is still a sensational 
possibility in this world — a debat-
able point — it comes only in brief 
flashes, in the ghost of a joke or the 
glimmer of a smile. It’s no coinci-
dence that it’s usually in the Short 
Sighted Woman’s vicinity.

“The Lobster” is funny because 

it’s clever, but you’re too busy hold-
ing your breath to laugh. Though 
the pace of the world is a steady, 
almost hopeless beat, it’s unpre-
dictable in its moments of passion-
less cruelty or timid, half-hearted 
bravery. It ends with a question; 
it asks audiences how much they 
believe in love, and, if not love, 
then how much they believe in 
basic human decency. It’s almost 
too frightening how absurd yet 
close to home the parameters of 
this story are.

Cameron Crowe fails 
to satisfy with ‘Roadies’

Well-known director’s 
look at music industry 

underwhelms

By SAM ROSENBERG

Daily Arts Writer

Man, can Cameron Crowe 

ever catch a break?

Known for creating highly 

acclaimed 
modern films 
like “Say Any-
thing,” 
“Sin-

gles,” 
“Jerry 

Maguire” 
and 
“Almost 

Famous,” 
the 

famed 
writ-

er-director 
has 
been 
in 

a slump for a while now. Since 
2001, Crowe’s filmography has 
mostly garnered mixed reac-
tions, from the sci-fi disas-
ter “Vanilla Sky” to last year’s 
panned romance flick “Aloha.” 
All of the smart writing and 
wonderful storytelling from his 
first few movies have gradually 
disappeared over time, trading 
in those elements for mawkish 
overtones, bland characters and 
humorless dialogue. Perhaps it 
makes sense then why Crowe has 
switched on over to television, 
creating and co-executive pro-
ducing Showtime’s music-cen-
tric dramedy “Roadies.” But even 
with a move to the small screen, 
Crowe still has trouble making 
his thematic and aesthetic trade-
marks refreshing again.

Despite 
Crowe’s 
reliably 

tasteful 
soundtrack 
and 
a 

talented cast, “Roadies” suffers 
from stiff writing, unlikable 
characters and a grating sense 
of self-importance. Similar to 
“Almost Famous,” “Roadies” is 
another one of Crowe’s gooey 
love letters to the art and soul of 
music. But in contrast to “Almost 
Famous,” “Roadies” packs none 
of the film’s charm, wit or spirit. 
The hour-long show also tends 
to over-romanticize the reality 
of being a roadie, something that 
real-life roadies who watched 
the show have acknowledged.

These 
detrimental 
plot 

elements become quickly evident 
in the series premiere episode, 
“Life is a Carnival,” where we 
meet protagonist Bill Hanson 
(Luke 
Wilson, 
“Idiocracy”), 

the tour manager of successful 
folk-rock group The Staton-
House Band. Following an apt 
Tom Petty quote in the opening 
titles, the show cuts to Bill in the 
first of three bizarre, gratuitous 
sex scenes of the episode in 
which 
he’s 
copulating 
with 

the 22-year-old daughter of a 
concert promoter rep. You would 
think this kind of situation 
would 
make 
Bill 
a 
sleazy 

character, but he turns out to 
be quite the opposite. Working 
alongside 
tour 
production 

manager Shelli (Carla Gugino, 
“The Brink”), Bill makes sure 
everyone does their job before 
the concert begins at a venue 
in New Orleans. This includes 
looking out for obsessive band 
stalker Natalie Shin (Jacqueline 
Byers, “Ascension”), removing 
any potential firecrackers that 
could appear and getting the 
stage ready for the band, which 
happens to be indie folk outfit 
The Head and The Heart.

There’s 
no 
denying 
that 

“Roadies” has an intriguing 
concept: following a group of 
people 
around 
the 
country 

on a music tour, where actual 
relatively 
popular 
bands 

perform. It’s also nice to have 
actual bands cameo and play 
music 
in 
“Roadies” 
instead 

of getting actors to do that. 
However, the execution feels 
off 
and 
underdeveloped, 
as 

Crowe’s craft is overshadowed 
by his attempt to boast his 
personal, somewhat defensive 

beliefs about music. That type 
of instance parallels to one 
particular 
tense 
sequence, 

where skateboarding lighting 
rigger and aspiring film student 
Kelly Ann (Imogen Poots, “That 
Awkward Moment”) challenges 
the corporate, cynical ideologies 
of stuffy British music financier 
Reg 
Whitehead 
(Rafe 
Spall, 

“What If”). Ann’s passionate 
response to Reg’s condescension 
of her and the rest of the roadie 
crew is undeniably sharp, thanks 
in part to Poots’s standout 
performance. Yet its underlying 
message doesn’t reach “Jerry 
Maguire” 
level 
heights 
of 

emotional conviction, nor does 
it satisfy in making the case for 
Crowe’s root-for-the-underdog 
approach. 

The rest of “Roadies” is 

generally 
underwhelming, 
in 

terms of the muddy dialogue 
and the occasionally awkward 
humor. 
There’s 
one 
really 

strange scene involving Natalie 
Shin fellating a microphone 
that makes you wonder what 
Crowe was trying to accomplish 
in writing that gross scenario. 
Within “Roadies,” there are 
some 
intermittent 
bright 

spots. Besides the sweet music 
interludes, Wilson and Gugino 
have great chemistry together, 
their characters trying to uphold 
a 
professional 
relationship 

while engaging in some fun 
bantering and even showing off 
their subtle romantic feelings 
for one another. But other 
than those small glimmers of 
hope, “Roadies” isn’t a drastic 
improvement to Crowe’s recent 
canon of mixed-to-negatively 
reviewed work.

Desiigner silences his 
naysayers — for now

MUSIC REVIEW

“New England” fails 
to prove Desiigner has 

staying power

By ANAY KATYAL

Summer Senior Arts Editor

For a man whose life has 

changed so drastically since Feb-
ruary, Desiigner has managed to 
keep himself 
from glorious-
ly crashing and 
burning off 
of the hype-
machine cliff. 
Congratula-
tions are in 
order for that, 
I guess. For 
a lot of people like myself, in the 
time between the release of The 
Life of Pablo — Desiigner’s intro-
duction to the mainstream rap 
game — and the release of New 
English, a lot of time was spent 
trying to figure out what to make 
of Desiigner’s talents. Is he a 
simple culture vulture riding the 
coattails of the Atlanta rap trend 
or is there more to the guy beyond 
his rapaciously hype demeanor? 
With the release of his much-
anticipated debut mixtape, Desii-
gner (fortunately) shows he’s more 
than someone who benefitted 
from positive circumstance, but 
his potential staying power (and 
potential legacy beyond a brief 
Kanye West cosign) is still a ques-
tion that remains up in the air.

New English is far from an 

artistic pinnacle among hip hop’s 
new wave of trap rookies, let alone 
hip hop itself — it’d be a farce to 
consider it otherwise. That being 
said, there’s something endear-
ingly brutish and primitive to 
Desiigner’s music that piques a 
part of my brain I didn’t know 
existed (namely, the part that 
wants to burn and destroy what-
ever’s around me). Much like 
“Panda,” Desiigner managed to 
channel stupefying levels of hype 
in his songs while remaining 
charmingly unintelligible all the 
same; hell, Desiigner manages the 
impossible by having all fourteen 

songs feel both completely alike 
and different at the same time. 
Things could’ve gone south quick-
ly for Desiigner had he released a 
project that fell far from the qual-
ity of the song that made his name 
in the first place (a common trope 
among hip hop’s rags-to-riches 
stories), but Desiigner and his fans 
can find solace in the fact that 
New English doesn’t fall far from 
the testosterone-heavy, “Panda”-
esque tree.

New English is a welcome sight 

for patrons of Kanye and GOOD 
Music, considering West’s label 
has seen its fair share of duds and 
promising acts that never man-
aged to capitalize on their hype. 
That being said, while Desiigner 
has something to show for him-
self beyond “Panda,” New English 
isn’t exactly a release that’ll stay 
on rotation months after its debut 
(largely due to the aforementioned 
lack of song variance). Songs like 
“Roll Wit Me,” “Da Day” and 
“Zombie Walk” all feature an 
enraged Desiigner yelling stereo-
typical trap-influenced adlibs (and 
fairly meaningless lyrics) into the 
microphone. Rarely do songs devi-
ate from that vibe, so much so that 
the project’s adherence to cohe-
sion in light of the style of “Panda” 
becomes its own undoing.

With this release, Desiigner 

also manages to place himself in 
the middle of a seemingly bur-
geoning wave occurring in rap 
music, a wave that can be accu-
rately dubbed as “post-lyrical 
rap.” With its generic trap hooks 
and familiar braggadocios, hyper-
bolic lyrics describing the ways 
of the caricatured Atlanta trap 
life, Desiigner is one of many new 

examples showing how lyrical 
substance is devolving toward 
obsolescence in the rap game. Art-
ists like Desiigner are purveyors 
of “vibes” more so than authentic-
ity, swapping the credibility and 
realness (of their own lives) for 
the opportunity to craft a musical 
aura shaped around preconceived 
notions of the rockstar drug-
dealing ways of Atlanta’s finest 
fugitives. It isn’t necessarily a 
bad thing — especially when such 
songs can provoke alarming, brut-
ish levels of excitement — but it’s 
disappointing to see the genre’s 
starlets going towards the way 
of what fits the current hip-hop 
zeitgeist rather than building a 
sustainable musical foundation for 
themselves to prosper off of in the 
long term.

In releasing New English, Desii-

gner does successfully manage 
to stave off some of the criticism 
that’s been thrown his way. The 
disparity between “Panda” and 
the rest of his songs is largely non-
existent, a testament to the man’s 
consistency. But if Desiigner 
wants to stick around once the 
dust surrounding rap’s exaggerat-
ed trap trend settles (and hip hop 
moves on to something new), the 
question remains whether Desii-
gner will co-opt something new, 
wither away into irrelevancy or 
actually manage to create a reper-
toire of music he can successfully 
call his own (something beyond 
his most recent project, that is). 
New English is something Desii-
gner can show for himself in the 
face of his doubters, but he’ll need 
something a bit more substantial 
to avoid being a faded memory of 
one of Kanye’s past projects.

“Kanye, I’m cool now! I promise!”

‘Brain’ is Dead

By ALEX INTNER

Summer Managing Arts Editor

Someone, please tell the Kings 

that they need to take a deep 
breath and just relax for a second. 
Robert 
and 

Michelle King 
(who 
created 

and ran “The 
Good 
Wife” 

for seven sea-
sons) are back 
on 
television 

only a couple 
months 
after 

the shaky end-
ing of their drama with a show that 
could not be more different from 
their 
long-running, 
acclaimed 

series. Where “Wife” was level-
headed and serious in its discus-
sion 
of 
politics, 
“BrainDead” 

takes its ideas to a new and rather 
absurd level. While there’s a fun 
series somewhere in its DNA, with 
the amount of setup the first two 
episodes had to them, the show 
couldn’t move past the bare-bones 
of its premise. The Kings seem 
to be letting the story breathe to 
the point where it loses a sense of 
cohesion and becomes a muddled 
mess.

“BrainDead” 
follows 
Laurel 

Healy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead, 
“10 Cloverfield Lane”), the sister 
of powerful Democratic United 
States senator Luke Healy (Danny 
Pino, “Cold Case”), who enters the 
world of politics to work in her 
brother’s office. She starts when a 
partisan battle is about to cause a 
government shutdown. Through 
her work with Luke, she deals 
with Gareth Ritter (Aaron Tveit, 
“Grease Live”), the young and 
charming assistant to Republican 
senator Red Wheatus (Tony Shal-
houb, “We Are Men”). Meanwhile, 
a group of bugs crash to Earth on a 
meteor and are brought to Wash-
ington D.C. by the Smithsonian. 
Throughout the first two episodes, 

they’re seen crawling into people’s 
ears, causing their brains to pop 
out of their heads and explode.

Within the arrival of the bugs 

and the largely unseen havoc they 
wreak on D.C. is a weird story that 
the show unfolds slowly but sure-
ly. It takes multiple episodes to 
gain insight into who the bugs are 
going after and how they go about 
targeting their victims. What we 
don’t know is the reason behind 
their attacks and the true effect on 
their victims. (What does losing 
their brains do to them? How do 
they still think without them?) It’s 
hard to hone in on what the show 
means and what it wants to say 
without clarity here. It’s one thing 
to let a story breathe, it’s another to 
completely confuse your audience.

Though, the series still has 

some elements which draw me in 
despite some of its more confusing 
elements. Like “The Good Wife,” 
“BrainDead” 
features 
a 
deep 

ensemble of New York actors who 
bring their characters to life with 
a sense of charm and charisma. 
Winstead and Tveit especially 
have fantastic chemistry, as scenes 
where the two share the screen 
crackle (and provide the show’s 
few laughs). The drama also fea-
tures a similar slickness and pro-
duction value that made “The 
Good Wife” so entertaining. You 
can see the Kings’ influence on the 
direction, camerawork and the 
score, all of which help me main-
tain a passive interest in watching 
their show.

I wish the Kings took a step 

back while planning “BrainDead” 
and took more time to adequately 
arc out their story. They intro-
duced too little of their main idea 
in the first two hours, leading to a 
jumble of a story arc. Still, Win-
stead and Tveit’s chemistry and 
the production values are going to 
be enough for me to keep tuning 
in for the rest of the drama’s short 
season.

 TV REVIEW


consistently maintain its spot in 
the top 10? 

Many aspects of College of 

Engineering’s success

Engineering 
Dean 
David 

Munson said there are many 
aspects 
of 
the 
College 
of 

Engineering that allow it to 
maintain 
its 
rankings 
and 

consistently receive funding year 
after year.

“We have grown a little bit 

each year in my time as dean,” 
Munson said. “We’ve hired really 
exceptional faculty members and, 
especially during the time of the 
recession and those surrounding 
years, when other universities 
didn’t have the resources to hire 
very many, if any, new faculty 
members in engineering, we 
hired basically as many top-notch 
people as we could find, and we 
really have an exceptional junior 
faculty that goes along with a 
really fine senior faculty.”

However, 
a 
high-quality 

faculty is just one facet of the 
college’s success, Munson said. 
Since he moved to Ann Arbor in 
2003, Munson has helped put 
many strategies into place to 
ensure students were receiving 
a 
top-notch 
engineering 

education, including improving 
the undergraduate experience 
through 
co-curricular 
and 

outside classroom experiences, 
such 
as 
the 
Center 
for 

Entrepreneurship, 
which 

encourages 
entrepreneurship 

among engineers, and expanded 
international programs.

“We’re working to get as many 

of our undergrads as possible to 
spend time overseas — whether 
it is in the form of a summer job, 
summer internship overseas or 
taking courses at a university 
or doing research overseas or 
perhaps 
offering 
volunteer 

service overseas,” Munson said. 
“We’ve tremendously ramped up 
the percentage of our students 
who 
are 
involved 
in 
those 

activities.”

Additionally, 
the 

Multidisciplinary 
Design 

Program 
— 
which 
involves 

students in large projects that are 
significant to modern industry 
and technological advances — 
has played a role in improving the 
College of Engineering alongside 
efforts to integrate engineering 
with the arts-related units on 
North Campus, like those in 
the School of Music, Theatre 

& Dance. Various programs, a 
minor track offering courses 
outside 
engineering 
and 
the 

recently 
implemented 
Living 

Arts section of the Bursley dorm 
— a learning community which 
brings together students from the 
different North Campus schools 
— are just some of the strategies 
to encourage creativity within 
the college.

Similarly, 
Munson 
said 

increased collaboration with the 
Ross Business School has allowed 
the college’s entrepreneurship 
program to expand each year. 
Jointly with the University’s 
Office of Technology Transfer, 
faculty and students can file 
for 
patents, 
launch 
start-up 

companies and expand their 
research 
through 
a 
business 

perspective.

Aside from goals aimed at 

improving 
the 
undergraduate 

experience, Munson said research 
takes up a substantial part of 
the College of Engineering’s 
goals, 
with 
annual 
research 

expenditures reaching more than 
$225 million a year.

Munson said the College of 

Engineering frequently partners 
with the Medical School.

“Between 
Engineering 
and 

Medicine, we are one of only 
two universities in the nation 
that 
have 
both 
top-ranked 

engineering and medical schools 
on the same campus, and so that 
conditions us in this great way to 
work so intensely with medicine,” 
Munson said.

The College of Engineering 

also 
partners 
with 
certain 

departments in LSA, such as the 
natural sciences and mathematics 
departments, as well as the School 
of Public Health, which make the 
undergraduate experience in the 
college unique.

“I think the undergraduate 

program 
we 
offer 
really 
is 

noticeably 
different 
and 

better compared to most other 
universities,” Munson said.

Ultimately, 
Munson 
credits 

much of the success of the college 
to multiple goals he and other 
administrators have set in place, 
including searching for the best 
faculty, staff and students — 
which has become much more 
competitive over the years.

“Our student selectivity has 

just tremendously improved in 
the last 10 years,” Munson said. 
“It’s much, much harder to gain 
entrance in engineering than it 
was 10 years ago.”

a gunman killed 49 people and 
injured 53 other victims at a gay

“Not so long ago, Equality 

Michigan probably wouldn’t have 
been at this table,” he said. “LGBT 
individuals are most likely to be 
victims of hate crimes.” 

Daniel Edinger, a gun owner 

who attended the panel, said he 
the discussion did not allow for 
alternative ideas and only repeated 
the same senitments.

“I 
disagree 
that 
anything 

presented here was a solution 
to gun violence,” Edinger said. 
“Terrorism, No-Fly List, none of 

these things are going to keep guns 
out of the hands that people who 
shouldn’t have them. This was an 
echo chamber. It wasn’t designed 
to provide a forum about safety. 
They didn’t invite any of the other 
side, and this is nothing but anti-
gun. It seems a little disingenous to 
me. The laws that are on the books 
aren’t being enforced effectively. 
That’s a good place to start.”

Despite 
disagreements 
on 

processes, the panelists and most 
audience members agreed on more 
stringent regulations and continued

stereotypes — such as that Black 
men are disproportionately likely 
to have criminal records — may be 
true, but they’re not applicable to 
one individual.

“In our case, when the law 

removed 
criminal 
history 

information from the application, 
the employers appear to use the 
race of the applicant to infer 

whether they had a criminal 
history — that is, they looked at 
a Black applicant and assumed 
they had a very high probability of 
having a record but looked at white 
applicants and assumed they had 
a very low, if any, probability of 
having a record,” Agan wrote. 
“Due to this perception, they were 
more likely to call back white 
applicants than Black applicants 
when there was no Box.”

Starr said making those race-

based assumptions is illegal, but 
it’sdifficult to enforce hiring-

discrimination laws.

“Essentially, by taking away 

the ability to discriminate on 
criminal records, you are going to 
get something maybe even worse, 
which is to discriminate on the 
basis of race because they are using 
it as a proxy for criminal records,” 
Starr said. “It may be an irrational 
proxy that isn’t fair, gauging it on 
exaggerated assumptions on the 
rates at which Black males have 
criminal records.”

White people with records 

benefit from Ban the Box, but they 

benefit at the expense of people 
of color without records, Starr 
explained.

Both Starr and Agan were 

surprised by the increase in 
the employed racial gap since 
employers 
were 
eventually 

allowed 
to 
run 
background 

checks.

“Although 
we 
suspected 

this would happen due to some 
past research and the theory 
of statistical discrimination, it 
wasn’t clear that employers would 
change their behavior since they 

could eventually do a background 
check,” Agan wrote. “So our 
results imply that at least some 
employers perceive a very high 
cost to interviewing people that 
may potentially have records.”

Starr 
said 
some 
potential 

solutions to address this issue 
were 
to 
erase 
questions 
on 

applications that could indicate 
race or to provide an incentive 
for employers to hire those with 
records; however, Starr said these 
were just ideas and were not part 
of the larger study.

accepted, 
while 
24.5 
percent 

of the 44,541 out-of-state and 
international applicants to the 
University were admitted.

University 
spokesman 
Rick 

Fitzgerald said the increase to 
6,600 
freshman 
enrolled 
this 

upcoming year was intentional, 
and University provost Martha 
Pollack 
coordinated 
with 

University schools and divisions to 
ensure adequate instructional and 
housing capacity. With the hiring of 
new faculty, creation of additional 
intro-level course sections and 
the completion of maintenance on 

housing facilities, the University 
will be able to accommodate more 
than 6,000 students, unlike in 
2014.

Fitzgerald said the decision 

to increase class size was driven 
by the continued growth of the 
University’s 
applicant 
pool. 

After switching to the Common 
Application 
— 
an 
application 

students can use to apply to 
hundreds of schools — in 2010, 
the number of applicants to the 
University immediately jumped 
by 25 percent, and the number 
of applicants has increased with 
each consecutive year. In the 
past six years, the annual number 
of freshman applicants to the 
University has increased by almost 

24,000.

“The number of applications 

continue to go up … and the 
University wanted to legitimately 
look at things carefully and say, 
‘could 
we 

accommodate 
more of these 
students 
showing 
this 

great 
interest 

in 
coming 
to 

Michigan?’ 
” Fitzgerald said. “Could we 
accommodate 
them 
without 

stretching ourselves too thin or 
at great additional expense? And 
what the University has decided is 
there is room for some growth as 
long as we can manage it properly 

and know what to expect.”

To 
exercise 
greater 
control 

over class size, the University’s 
admissions office has reduced 
the number of early admission 

offers it grants 
in 
December, 

placing 
greater 

emphasis 
on 

the 
regular 

decision 
cycle 

and the waitlist. 
Fitzgerald 
said 

that doing so would grant the 
admissions office greater flexibility 
later in the admissions cycle, as 
students who are accepted early 
are more likely to matriculate.

“Doing fewer students who we 

know will come ... helps to increase 

the overall diversity of the class 
as well and leaves some more 
flexibility in the normal admissions 
process,” he said.

In addition, Fitzgerald said the 

University has reduced the lag time 
between the release of admissions 
decisions 
and 
financial 
aid 

information to further streamline 
the admissions and matriculation 
process, 
allowing 
prospective 

students to have the necessary 
information to commit to enrolling 
at the University sooner.

“That really helps students make 

a better-informed decision earlier 
in the process,” Fitzgerald said. 
“Reducing that gap of time really 
helps students make their decisions 
about coming to Michigan or not.”

A look at the Michigan football recruiting class of 2017 

By ORION SANG

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Jim Harbaugh and the rest of the 

Michigan football coaching staff 
are near the end of a month-long 
satellite camp tour that has taken 
them across the United States and 
to international locales such as 
Australia and American Samoa.

The presumable cause: to help 

secure the best recruiting class 
possible.

Harbaugh 
and 
company 
are 

looking to build upon a 2016 
recruiting class that finished fifth 
in the nation, according to the 
247Sports Composite Ranking.

Currently, the Wolverines have 

the fourth-ranked 2017 class with 
the potential to rise even higher.

The gunslinger
It all starts with quarterback 

commit Dylan McCaffrey. The son of 
former NFL player Ed and younger 
brother of 2015 Heisman runner-up 
Christian, Dylan is a highly-touted 
prospect in his own right. A 6-foot-
5, right-handed passer that plays 
at perennial powerhouse Valor 
Christian in Colorado, McCaffrey 
is ranked as the No. 1 pro-style 
quarterback in the nation and No. 22 
player of any position, according to 
the 247Sports Composite Ranking.

“(McCaffrey) is a really good 

prospect,” said Scout.com Midwest 

Football Recruiting Manager Allen 
Trieu. “He has great intangibles, he’s 
accurate and I think, if you watch 
him in pressure situations, like the 
state title game he played in, you 
really see those intangibles. He’s a 
leader, he’s cool under pressure and 
really exhibits the characteristics 
you’d expect from a kid who grew up 
around sports his whole life. I’d say 
his arm strength is an area he can 
continue to improve in, but he’s also 
a good athlete who can run.”

McCaffrey 
committed 
to 

Michigan earlier this winter, less 
than two weeks after National 
Signing Day, which, according to 
Trieu, has helped Michigan out in 
more ways than one.

“I thought he was a huge 

commitment,” Trieu said. “Not 
only because he’s a great player in 
his own right, but because he (also) 
helps with recruiting other players.”

Thunder, lightning and a cloud 

of dust

O’Maury Samuels is another 

similarly-touted Michigan commit 
from out west.

Samuels, a 5-foot-11, 190-pound 

running back from New Mexico, 
also holds the distinction of being 
perhaps the most athletic high 
school football player in the country. 
His Nike SPARQ rating, derived 
from a series of tests that assess 
one’s speed, power, agility, recovery 

and quickness, is the highest in the 
country at 138.30.

“Samuels is a great athlete,” Trieu 

said. “He’s a home run hitter, which 
is something Michigan hasn’t had a 
ton of in the backfield of late. Great 
job by the staff getting in on him 
early, but now they’re fighting for 
him a bit.”

Samuels is ranked as a four-

star and the No. 20 running back 
prospect in the nation.

While Samuels and his laser-

timed 4.45 40-yard dash bring speed 
to the class, the Wolverines also have 
two more running back commits 
that bring different skill sets to the 
table.

And for A.J. Dillon, a 6-foot-

1, 230 lb., three-star prospect 
from Massachusetts, that set is a 
unique combination of power and 
athleticism.

His athleticism is apparent from 

his SPARQ score of 127.53 — which 
includes a 4.53 40-yard dash — while 
his bruising style of running can be 
seen in his highlight tape.

And then there’s Kurt Taylor, a 

three-star from Georgia.

“Dillon is a big, physical back who 

has shown that, despite his size, he 
has speed too,” Trieu said. “Taylor 
is sort of in between (Samuels and 
Dillon) style-wise. I think, if you’re 
going to take three backs, they 
should all be different from one 

another and that’s what you have 
here, three guys who bring three 
very different styles.”

The big uglies
The Wolverines appear to have 

recruited the offensive line with 
similar goals as they have the 
running backs.

They 
currently 
have 
three 

offensive linemen committed and 
look poised to add more to offset 
the losses the team will suffer after 
this season. Michigan will graduate 
fifth-year senior guards Kyle Kalis 
and Ben Braden and fifth-year 
senior tackle Erik Magnuson from 
its starting lineup alone, and junior 
center Mason Cole becomes draft 
eligible as well.

Currently 
in 
Michigan’s 

recruiting class are JaRaymond 
Hall, Andrew Stueber and Joel 
Honigford. Hall, a four-star from 
Michigan, is the higher-ranked 
prospect of the three and appears 
to have the requisite length and 
athleticism to stick at left or right 
tackle.

Though Hall is ranked higher 

than his counterparts, both Stueber 
and Honigford have been heavily-
recruited prospects throughout this 
cycle.

Stueber has garnered more than 

a dozen offers despite being from 
Connecticut, a state that typically 
isn’t highly scouted and doesn’t put 

out many Division 1-caliber recruits. 
According to 247Sports, he holds 
offers from Duke, North Carolina, 
Penn State and Tennessee, among 
others. Stueber, who weighs in at 
6-foot-6, 285 pounds, is also a tackle.

Honigford 
— 
like 
his 
two 

classmates — is a tackle, standing at 
6-foot-6, 249 pounds. Like Stueber, 
Honigford holds more offers than 
his ranking would suggest, having 
received more than two dozen 
offers already, including tenders 
from Michigan State, Oklahoma 
and Auburn. The three-star is from 
Ohio and committed to Michigan in 
a statement released on Twitter on 
Wednesday.

Dual-threat fullbacks
Michigan 
holds 
commitments 

from two athletes in Chase Lasater 
and Ben Mason who could end up 
as blockers in the Michigan offense 
(as fullbacks) — though the former 
appears more likely to do so than the 
other.

“Lasater is a physical fullback 

who can carry the ball,” Trieu said. 
“I think Michigan has shown with 
Sione Houma that they’ll use that 
position too so (Lasater’s) an asset. 
Mason is a bigger kid who can play 
linebacker or defensive line. We’ll see 
how he continues to grow and what 
his body develops like will determine 
where he will play.”

Dipping down south
Considering their geographic 

locations, it would be silly to say 
that 
Michigan’s 
much-talked 

about 
satellite 
camps 
haven’t 

affected three-star safety commit 
J’Marick Woods and four-star 
defensive tackle commit Aubrey 
Solomon. But while the camps did 
indirectly help Michigan with both 
— perhaps more so with Solomon, 
whose 
high 
school 
hosted 

Michigan’s staff for a camp — they 
weren’t the main reason why the 
staff has been able to secure verbal 
commitments from the two over 
SEC schools, according to Trieu.

“I think those commitments 

show how satellite camps combine 
with recruiting efforts (from) 
the rest of the year and allow 
the staff to put (emphasis) on an 
area, which Michigan has done 
with the southeast,” Trieu said. 
“Those kids committed on campus 
in Ann Arbor, but that may not 
have happened had Michigan 
not spent time down there or 
shown that recruiting there is 
important. So I think it all plays a 
part, but the satellite camps didn’t 
directly affect these particular 
commitments.”

And 
though 
the 
staff’s 

recruiting efforts down south have 
gotten more publicity, its efforts 
up north have been just as strong 
— particularly within Canada and 
their home state.

Michigan mounties
The 
Wolverines 
have 

commitments from two Canadians 
in Benjamin St. Juste and Luiji 
Vilain, both of whom play defense.

St. Juste, a rangy, 6-foot-3 

defensive back, committed to 
Michigan more than a year ago but 
has stayed steady in his pledge to 
the Wolverines, even after success 
at camps this offseason earned him 
a bump in the rankings and a spot 
at The Opening, Nike’s prestigious 
training camp.

“St. Juste has gone out and done 

really well at some camps,” Trieu 
said. “I think, even with that, he’s 
still a relative unknown because 
he’s only been seen at a handful 
of events. That said, he shows 
the cover skills at that size to 
project to corner first. He’s gotten 
a little stronger and you can see 
the confidence he has now after 
hanging with the best. I think 
we’ll find out even more about him 
at The Opening.”

Vilain, a native of Canada who 

moved to Virginia in high school, 
is a four-star defensive end and 
the third highest-ranked player 

in Michigan’s class thus far after 
McCaffrey and Solomon.

Hometown kids
Meanwhile, 
the 
Wolverines 

already have five in-state players 
committed 
after 
signing 
just 

three last year. Michigan holds 
verbal commitments from the 
aforementioned Hall, four-star 
linebacker Josh Ross, four-star 
defensive end Corey Malone-
Hatcher, 
three-star 
defensive 

tackle Phillip Paea and three-star 
tight end Carter Dunaway, and the 
Wolverines sit in a good position 
with a few more prospects from 
the mitten state.

“After not getting as many 

in-state guys last year, I think it’s 
been more of an emphasis this year 
and it’s paying off,” Trieu said. 
“The in-state class they have so 
far is very good, and it should only 
get better. I think they’ll get Jaylen 
Kelly-Powell and they’re certainly 
in position to be in on Donovan 
Peoples-Jones and Ambry Thomas 
down the stretch, so you add one or 
both of them to what you already 
have and it’s a great in-state class. 
Then you still have Jordan Reid 
and Deron Irving-Bey out there 
too, so they have a chance to close 
strong in-state.”

Finishing things out
Though Michigan’s class is 

already among the nation’s best, 
it is only expected to get better 
down the stretch. The Wolverines 
sit at or near the top with many of 
their top targets, most of whom 
are expected to decide later in the 
process.

“Kelly-Powell, James Hudson, 

some of the southern linemen 
like Toryque Bateman, Kai-Leon 
Herbert and T.J. Slaton too,” Trieu 
said. “I don’t know that they’ll 
get all of those southern linemen, 
but they’ll get a couple. Nico 
Collins and Peoples-Jones are two 
top receivers on the board and 
Michigan is in good shape with 
both of them too. Drew Singleton 
is a kid we’ve always felt would end 
up at Michigan. Those are some of 
the guys I’d feel best about, but 
Michigan is in good position for 
more guys than that too.

“I think you’d have to give (the 

staff) an ‘A’ (for what they’ve done 
so far). They’re hard workers, 
they’re innovative and the class 
they signed last year, especially 
landing Rashan Gary, was a great 
class and one that they had to 
really battle for. You look at how 
they closed, and how they pulled 
some kids like Devin Asiasi from 
farther away late in the game, and 
I thought it was an outstanding 
job.”

Mikulak, Jaeger make Olympics

By ETHAN WOLFE

Summer Managing Sports Editor

The University of Michigan 

will have solid representation 
at the 2016 Summer Olympics, 
sending 18 former and current 
student-athletes to Rio de Janeiro 
to compete with many more still 
attempting to qualify. This week, 
two of those athletes found out 
they would be making the trip.

The first athlete to clinch a 

spot was former Michigan men’s 
gymnast Sam Mikulak. Mikulak 
graduated in 2014 and will be 
participating in his second Olympic 
Games after qualifying in 2012 for 
London.

During 
Saturday’s 
Olympic 

Trials, 
Mikulak 
compiled 
the 

highest all-around score, 362.750, 
to clinch his spot in Rio.

“To finally see the team and 

who it’s going to be, we look at 
each other and realize that we’re 
all about to do something great,” 
Mikulak told USA Gymnastics. 
“I’m itching to get back in the 
gym, and I’m glad I have another 
opportunity to do that.”

Mikulak had a storied career 

while competing at the collegiate 
level for the Wolverines. A three-
time Big Ten Gymnast of the 
Year, Mikulak was instrumental 
in helping the Wolverines clinch 
the NCAA title in the 2013 and 
2014 seasons. Mikulak won the 
all-around and parallel in both 
NCAA Championships, including 
becoming the high bars champion 
in 2013 as well.

In the 2012 Olympics, the United 

States gymnasts secured a fifth-
place finish, with Mikulak placing 
fifth in the vault.

The second athlete to qualify for 

the Rio Games was Michigan men’s 
swimmer Connor Jaeger who, like 
Mikulak, graduated from Michigan 
in 2014 and will be participating in 
his second Olympic games.

Jaeger punched his second ticket 

to the Olympic games on Sunday 
with his performance during the 
men’s 400-meter freestyle final at 
the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials 
in Omaha, Neb. Jaeger was trailing 
for most of the race, but a burst 
of energy in the final 100 meters 
propelled him to a first-place finish 
with a time of 3:43.79.

“I almost had an out-of-body 

experience at the 200 (meter mark), 
thinking, ‘Man, am I out of this 
or am I going to turn it around?,’ 
”Jaeger said in a statement. “I 
basically said there was no giving 
up. I just went until I couldn’t feel 
my legs or arms anymore. The last 
50, I peeped over and I was ahead. 
It was an incredible realization. 
I just went as hard as I could. I 
couldn’t believe I placed first.”

 At Michigan, Jaeger was a 

two-time 
national 
champion 

in the 1,650-yard freestyle and 
was a champion in the 500-yard 
freestyle in 2013. Jaeger was a team 
captain for Michigan during the 
2014 season, in which Michigan 
earned its fourth straight Big Ten 
championship and finished fourth 
at the NCAA Championships.

His 
individual 
performance 

made him a two-time University of 
Michigan Male Athlete of the Year 
and two-time Big Ten Swimmer of 
the Year.

Both Mikulak and Jaeger left 

lasting legacies at Michigan and 
have continued their dominance at 
the international level. This August 
in Rio, they’ll have yet another 
chance to leave their mark.

SUMMER OLYMPICS


Steinberg accepted job 

offer at Arizona State 

nine days earlier

By ETHAN WOLFE

Summer Managing Sports Editor

The search for a new Michigan 

men’s tennis coach was quick and 
painless. In fact, there wasn’t 
much of a search 
at all.

Nine 
days 

after 
it 
was 

announced that 
Adam Steinberg 
would resign as 
the head coach 
to 
take 
the 

same position at 
Arizona 
State, 

he notified the 
Sun 
Devils’ 

athletic 
department 
that 
he 

would no longer be taking the 
job, and was reunited once again 
with the Wolverines.

Steinberg will enter his third 

season at the helm, and has 
collected a 28-25 record in his 
previous two seasons. His first 
year coaching the Wolverines, 

the team finished with their 
worst record in program history, 
7-17. 
But 
Steinberg’s 
unique 

coaching tactics came to fruition 
quickly: Michigan finished last 
season 21-8, and advanced to 
the second round of the NCAA 
Regionals.

Returning a number of last 

years starters, alongside the 
addition of a top-30 recruiting 

class, 
the 

Wolverines 
look 
to 

improve 
on 

their 
already 

impressive 
14-win 
turnaround. 
And 
if 
last 

season is any 
indication 
of 

how 
much 

a 
team 
can 

improve in one season, then 
exceeding 21 wins is a definite 
possibility.

“I look forward to being at the 

University of Michigan for many 
years to come and to build upon 
what we have established the last 
two years,” Steinberg said in a 
statement.

Caris LeVert led the Wolverines in points and rebounds before getting injured in his junior and senior seasons. 
LeVert drafted 20th overall

By ETHAN WOLFE

Summer Managing Sports Editor

Despite battling foot injuries in 

his junior and senior seasons, Caris 
LeVert has found a home in the 
NBA, much earlier than expected.

LeVert was selected as the 

20th pick in the first round by the 
Indiana Pacers of Thursday’s NBA 
Draft. As part of a trade made 
earlier in the day, the rights to 
LeVert will be sent to the Brooklyn 

Nets. Prior to the draft on April 1, 
LeVert 
signed 

with 
Jay-Z’s 

Roc 
Nation 

— 
the 
same 

entertainment 
agency 
that 

represents 
Oklahoma 
City 
Thunder 

forward Kevin 
Durant.

“I’m really blessed to be in 

this situation,” LeVert said to the 

media 
after 

his 
selection. 

“None 
of 
this 

was 
possible 

without God, my 
family, and all 
my 
teammates 

and 
coaches 

throughout 
the years. I’m 
blessed 
to 
be 

here, like I said. Through all the 
adversity I went through the past 
couple of years, I’m lost for words 
right now to be here.”

Due to his lack of playing 

time because of injury, LeVert 
had to plead his case to NBA 
teams to even get selected. In a 
letter published by LeVert in The 
Players’ Tribune, he cites Durant 
and Portland Trail Blazers guard 
CJ McCollum as notable players 
who have succeeded in the pros 
despite suffering similar injuries. 
His injuries didn’t seem to hurt his 
draft stock too much, though.

Prior 
to 
his 
season-ending 

ailments the past two seasons, the 
six-foot-seven guard led Michigan 
in scoring and rebounding. His 
16.5 points, 5.3 boards and 4.9 
assists in his final season were 
all improvements from his junior 
campaign.

The 
Pickerington, 
Ohio-

native came off the bench during 
Michigan’s run to the 2013 NCAA 
Championship game, and recorded 
Michigan’s 
fourth-ever 
triple 

double against Northern Kentucky 
December 15. LeVert’s 98 career 
wins were six away from the all-
time record at Michigan.

MEN’S TENNIS

“I’m really 

blessed to be in 
this situation.”

Steinberg quickly returns

“I look forward to 
being at Michigan 
for many years to 

come.”
