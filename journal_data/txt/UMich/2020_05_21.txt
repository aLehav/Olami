During the early days of the 

COVID-19 
pandemic, 
Mary 

Rose, program manager in the 
Office of Diversity, Equity and 
Inclusion at the University of 
Michigan, felt her uneasiness 
grow about her public perception 
as she took her son to their local 
urgent care clinic. 

“I 
remember 
purposely 

wearing my Michigan t-shirt 
underneath my big winter coat,” 
Rose said. “As soon as I got 
inside I unzipped it. I felt like 
I had to consciously make an 
effort to indicate that I was not a 
recent immigrant, that I did not 
just come here off a plane from 
anywhere — I am a part of this 
community.”

Rose 
noted 
her 
thoughts 

were fueled by social media 
and reports of Asian Americans 
being discriminated against and 
said sometimes she hesitates to 
go out by herself. 

“I weigh in my mind, ‘Is there 

a chance that I let my guard down 
and I go out and somebody might 
harass me, or do something, and 
I might not be with my family?’” 
Rose said.

Melissa 
Borja, 
assistant 

professor of American culture, 

said she sometimes gets nervous 
about going outside, not only 
because she does not want to 
be infected, but also because 
she is concerned about racial 
harassment. 

“It just struck me as this great 

irony that in March and in April, 
we were living in lockdown 
situations and we were told ‘get 
out’, ‘get some fresh air,’ ‘it’s 
good for your mental health, 
once a day just go for a walk,’” 
Borja said. “But, it’s a very 
stressful thing to ‘get out,’ ‘get 
fresh air,’ ‘go on a walk,’ as an 
Asian person, since Asian people 
were getting spit on, were having 
racist things yelled at them by 
drivers passing by.”

According to the Center for 

Disease Control, on Jan. 21, 
2020, the first case of COVID-
19 was identified in the United 
States.

In March, Secretary of State 

Mike Pompeo referred to the 
2019 novel coronavirus as the 
“Wuhan virus” and President 
Donald Trump called COVID-19 
the “China virus.” CDC Director 
Robert Redfield condemned the 
use of such language, saying 
it was “absolutely wrong and 
inappropriate.” 

As COVID-19 continued to 

spread, the Los Angeles Times 
reported a rise in hate crimes 

toward Asian Americans from 
February to April. The article 
echoed an FBI warning of the 
potential surge in hate crimes 
against Asian Americans during 
the pandemic. The warning 
detailed an incident in Midland, 
Texas, in which an Asian-
American family was stabbed 
because the attacker “thought 
the family was Chinese, and 
infecting 
people 
with 
the 

coronavirus.”

Rose, Borja and many other 

University community members 
are taking action to combat the 
rise in anti-Asian hate crimes 
and to raise awareness of racist 
and xenophobic acts. 

In this article, the acronyms 

AAPI (Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders), A/PIA (Asian/
Pacific Islander American) and 
APID/A (Asian Pacific Islander 
Desi/Americans) 
will 
be 

frequently used.

Disarming racism: community 
members fight anti-Asian hate

Design by Francesca Duong 

Joe Biden, former vice president and 2020 

presidential candidate, hosted a virtual town 
hall with three state governors and over 
9,000 viewers to discuss state and national 
responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden 
was joined by Michigan Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and 
Connecticut Gov. Edward Lamont to discuss 
the response of the Trump administration, 
the current condition of their respective 
states and what the future would hold for the 
nation Thursday afternoon. 

Biden said local and state government 

officials have been taking action to flatten 
the curve and mitigate public fear during the 
pandemic.

“There are a lot of scared people all across 

the country and so often it’s all of you that 
they are looking to,” Biden said. “This is not 
a partisan statement. Governors, mayors, 
local leaders, you’re all stepping up all across 
the country — Republicans and Democrats 
alike.” 

Biden emphasized the importance of 

opening the economy as quickly as possible 
while listening to the recommendations of 
public health experts. 

“We are going to have to work harder 

and smarter than ever before to pull 
ourselves out of this economic tailspin,” 
Biden said. “I know what all of you know, 
that the only way out of this is following 
science: Listening to the experts and taking 
responsible precautions that are going to 
help us reopen the economy as safely and as 
quickly as possible. We have an opportunity, 
in my view, to transform the economy as we 
come out, to build a more inclusive and more 
resilient middle class.” 


In an effort to assist the state 

of Michigan community groups 
and lawyers as they navigate the 
overflow of legal work related to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, a group 
of University of Michigan Law 
School student leaders formed 
the Michigan Law COVID Corps, 
a pro bono service with over 240 
volunteers and student attorneys.

The 
organization 
does 
not 

offer legal advice or represen-
tation. Rather, volunteers offer 
assistance in the form of legal or 
policy research, data gathering or 
legal analysis. COVID Corps has 
worked with a variety of organi-
zations, including the Michigan 
Workers’ Rights Clinic and Michi-
gan Immigrant Rights Center, who 
requested their help through their 
online form. 

Law 
School 
student 
Maiya 

Moncino founded the group in 
March. Moncino said she felt it 
was necessary for students to step 
up and help lawyers combat the 
shockwaves of the pandemic dur-
ing this unprecedented time. 

“It’s important for us to be 

invested in the community that 
is giving us a legal education,” 
Moncino said.

The COVID Corps is organized 

into four task forces: Decarcera-
tion, Workers’ Rights and Small 
Business Support, Voting Rights 
and Housing Rights. While the 
COVID Corps focuses on those 
issues, they are not limited to 
them.

Law School student Sian Last 

is a COVID Corps participant and 
has worked on two projects since 
joining the group. Last drafted a 
petition to release an incarcerated 
person from prison who had previ-
ously been granted parole but was 
being held due to the new COVID-
19 procedures, and he compiled 
research regarding the release of 
immigrant detainees. 

“The really powerful thing 

about being a lawyer and being a 
law student is the ability to help 
people better their situation, espe-

cially in a time when things are as 
difficult as they are,” Last said. “It 
seemed like there was nothing bet-
ter to do with my time than to try 
and help people in whatever way 
is possible to navigate these sys-
tems.”

Law School students Chris 

Chorzepa and Stephan Llerena are 
two of six leaders on the Workers’ 
Rights and Small Business Support 
task force. 

Over 1 million Michigan resi-

dents have filed for unemployment, 
leaving the Michigan Workers’ 
Rights Clinic overwhelmed with 
individuals in need of assistance 
filing for unemployment insurance 
benefits. Llerena said because the 
Law School allows first-year stu-
dents to participate in the Work-
ers’ Rights Clinic, volunteers are 
equipped to support attorneys 
with research and intake calls. 

Chorzepa was inspired to create 

the Small Business task force after 
researching relief options to keep 
his own family’s small business 
afloat. He knew the U.S. Small 
Business 
Administration 
was 

offering loans to help small busi-
nesses survive in the pandemic, so 
he learned how to file an applica-
tion to receive the loan. 

“I thought, if I can do this for 

my parents, I can definitely do this 
for small businesses around Mich-
igan,” Chorzepa said.

Kerry Martin, a recent Law 

School graduate who has been 
working at Michigan Immigrant 
Rights Center since January, has 
delegated two projects to the vol-
unteers. Martin said that with 
the help of the volunteers, MIRC 
is able to address extra research 
projects the center may not have 
been able to tackle due to the high 
influx of work. 

“This volunteer corps comes at 

such an important time because 
so many legal service organiza-
tions are working in overdrive to 
respond to the crisis,” Martin said. 
“Already, our creative muscles are 
at limit because there’s so many 
ways in which this crisis deepens 
the underlying issues and also the 
procedural obstacles for our cli-
ents to get some form or relief or 
justice.”

COVID Corps helps 
lighten legal work

Approximately 7,200 freshmen 

are expected to begin taking 
classes 
at 
the 
University 
of 

Michigan in the fall, a 20 percent 
increase from the target class size 
six years ago.

The 
University 
was 
500 

students over target when 6,532 
enrolled in the fall 2014 freshman 
class. In response, University 
leadership introduced a plan to 
ensure an end to the trend of over-
enrolling seen in previous years.

Now, the University is prepared 

to have 7,182 freshmen — its target 
class size — enrolled starting in 
the fall 2020 semester, according 
to an email from University 
spokesperson 
Rick 
Fitzgerald. 

Having a larger class size required 
more students to be admitted than 
in previous years, Fitzgerald said.

Fitzgerald 
said 
this 
larger 

target allows the University to 
lessen the effect COVID-19 could 
have on the class size. While he 
said that the matriculation rate 
has increased, the University is 
watching for “summer melt,” a 
term that refers to when students 
pay a deposit in spring but 
ultimately decide not to attend the 
school before fall.

A class size of 6,000 students 

would fall below the high-6,000 
number the University brought 

in over the past three years. For 
comparison, the University’s goal 
size for the fall 2020 class would 
include one additional student to 
every five in the fall 2014 target 
size.

The concerns with having 

6,500 students in the class were 
partially rooted in West Quad, one 
of the largest dorms, being under 
renovation. But the University 
also had to expand its academic 
offerings to accommodate the 
additional students: LSA added 
86 class sections and the College 
of 
Engineering 
hired 
more 

instructors to teach additional 
discussion sections for first-year 
courses.

There is the question, then, as 

to if these same issues arise with a 
class of 7,182 — 700 larger than the 
6,500-person class that spurred 
these additions. Fitzgerald said 
they will not.

The University is simply more 

strategic when determining a 
class size than it was six years 
ago, Fitzgerald said, and the class 
was 
“purposefully 
increased” 

after consulting with the Office 
of 
Enrollment 
Management, 

Office of the Provost and the 
University’s colleges and schools. 
He also pointed to the fact that 
University-wide enrollment has 
grown over the last several years. 
University 
administrators 
and 

enrollment managers are hopeful 
the larger class size will also ease 
any potential impacts COVID-19 
could have on the class size.

Driving alongside cars and 

bikes at 15 mph, Refraction AI’s 
autonomous robot, REV-1, is 
making food deliveries for four 
Ann Arbor restaurants and The 
Produce Station. The deliveries 
reach about 500 customers who 
order their food and groceries 
through an app after signing up 
for a pilot program on Refrac-
tion AI’s website. 

Refraction AI, based in Ann 

Arbor, 
was 
co-founded 
by 

Matthew 
Johnson-Roberson, 

associate professor of naval 
architecture and marine engi-
neering, and Ram Vasudevan, 
assistant professor of mechani-
cal engineering, with the goal of 
creating an autonomous vehicle 
that could be used on a wide 
scale. The start-up currently has 
17 full-time employees and eight 
autonomous vehicles.

REV-1 uses ultrasound waves 

to navigate its deliveries and is 
equipped with 12 cameras to 
ensure the safety of pedestrians 
and the robot while it makes its 
deliveries. Employees are able to 
work from home but are able to 
take over the motion of the robot 
in case of malfunction.

According to Johnson-Rober-

son, the robot delivery service 
is just what people need during 
this pandemic when access to 
food and groceries without con-
tact is essential.

“People are excited about con-

tactless delivery,” Johnson-Rob-
erson said. “They don’t want to 
leave their house and this (is) a 
way they can avoid it.” 

Jeremy Seaver, owner of Tios 

Mexican Cafe, one of the four 
restaurants currently using the 
robot delivery service, finds the 
delivery service extremely help-
ful during COVID-19 as it makes 
deliveries easier for his restau-
rant.

Seaver was optimistic about 

the robot delivery service’s suc-
cess post-pandemic. He said he 

believes it eradicates the strug-
gle restaurants face in staffing 
delivery drivers due to the pres-
ence of delivery services like 
Grubhub and Doordash. 

“It’s the most ideal thing pos-

sible. It’s completely contact-
less,” Seaver said. “I think this 
is a great way to do delivery. 
I would love to switch to only 
using the robots.”

In a typical robot-delivered 

order, customers place orders 
through Refraction AI’s app and 
the restaurant is notified. The 
restaurant then processes the 
order and receives a notification 
of the arrival of the robot. After 
the robot is unlocked by input-
ting a code, the order is then 
loaded into hot bags. The robot 
is locked again and then sent to 
make the delivery.

According to Johnson-Rober-

son, Refraction AI’s robot deliv-
ery service is more appealing to 
restaurant owners because it is 
cost-effective. While services 
like Grubhub and Doordash 
charge restaurants about 30-35 
percent of the restaurant’s cut, 
Refraction AI only charges 15 
percent. The service is also 
especially appealing to restau-
rants during COVID-19 as it 
reduces the number of people 
involved in the delivery process.

“One less person means one 

less risk, one less challenge,” 
Johnson-Roberson said.

In 
addition 
to 
restaurant 

delivery, robots also deliver 
curbside 
groceries 
through 

The Produce Station, a produce 
market on South State Street. 
Andrew Gorsuch, vice president 
of The Produce Station, found 
out about Refraction AI’s deliv-
ery service after their trial run 
with Korean eatery Miss Kim, 
and he said he is happy with the 
delivery service and the feed-
back he has received from cus-
tomers of the store.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com NEWS

On May 13, the Ann Arbor Public 

Schools Board of Education approved 
the district’s acquisition of the online 
educational platform Schoology by 
a 6-1 vote. The new platform will 
be adopted starting this summer, as 
teachers will receive training this 
month and begin instructing sum-
mer classes online with Schoology as 
soon as July. At the end of the sum-
mer, the platform will be reviewed 
and considered for future use in the 
event of a partially or fully online fall 
semester.

Superintendent of Schools Jean-

ice Swift opened the hearing of the 
proposal to acquire Schoology by 
identifying the district’s intentions 
to streamline communication with 
the unified platform.

“We are looking to streamline the 

learning management platform for 
the district,” Swift said. “The goal 
is to improve the tools by which our 
teachers do their work and to stream-
line the approach by which parents 
locate their communications from 
the district, their student grades, 
their student attendance (and) their 
student assignments.” 

The Schoology platform boasts 

efficient communication between 
students, 
teachers, 
parents 
and 

administrators, as well as interop-
erability with a number of popular 
educational tools and platforms 
including Khan Academy and Pow-
erSchool, according to its website.

During the board meeting, Dawn 

Linden, assistant superintendent and 
district leader, presented the results 
of a preliminary research study con-
ducted to gather teachers’ input on 
the Schoology platform. According 
to Linden, 186 teachers participated 
in an hour-long Schoology demon-
stration and 135 shared their initial 
reactions in the survey afterward.

“In general, the biggest concern 

was the ability to process change,” 
Linden said. “The major concern that 
we heard was learning a new tool.”

Peter Stenger, a junior at Huron 

High School, expressed similar 
skepticism regarding the benefits 
of the new platform in an interview 
with The Daily. He identified Google 
Classroom as the predominant plat-
form his instructors have used since 
the district’s government-mandated 
transition into remote learning. 
Stenger cited experiences using 
other platforms like Zoom, Flip Grid 
and Mango Learning across different 
subjects. He had no previous experi-
ence with the Schoology platform.

“Right now, Google Classroom 

is the unified platform (at Huron), 
so really, I don’t see a lot of major 
changes (coming with the adoption 
of the Schoology platform),” Stenger 

said. “It might be a little harder for 
students to use the new platform if 
they’re not familiar with it. So yeah, 
maybe it could be negative in that 
sense ... I wouldn’t see a lot of benefit 
in moving to the unified platform.”

Several elementary school teach-

ers expressed concern in survey 
responses regarding whether use of 
the platform Seesaw would still be 
possible. Linden said the acquisition 
of the Schoology platform would not 
necessarily preclude other platforms 
that teachers have grown accus-
tomed to.

“Our goal is not to eliminate things 

that are working,” Linden said. “Our 
goal is to make things efficient and 
easy for teachers. … If (Seesaw is) the 
tool that works … we wouldn’t take it 
away.”

Lillian Losinski, a sophomore at 

Skyline High School, voiced support 
for the Schoology platform in an 
interview with The Daily. Though 
she did not have prior experience 
with the platform, she said it had 
potential to alleviate the confusion 
created by teachers using different 
platforms.

“From what I did read, it kind of 

seemed like (Schoology) was … like 
everything that we’re doing right 
now, but under one program,” Losin-
ski said. “I feel like it’d be better 
because it would just be more, like, 
connected.”

I

magine coming home from the 
grocery store, twisting open the 
seal on a gallon of milk that you just 

bought and pouring that milk straight 
down the drain. It seems unnatural — 
maybe even cynical — to waste perfectly 
good nutrients like this. However, many 
farmers in the United States are now left 
with no other choice. Instead of turning 
a seal on a carton of milk, they are turn-
ing the hatch on a 12-wheeler steel tank 
and dumping an estimated 3.7 million 
gallons of milk daily. 

Due to COVID-19, many restaurants, 

hotels and schools have closed and as a 
result, the food system has been severely 
impacted. When all of the custom-
ers vanish, farmers are left with few 
options. Many have tried donating their 
produce to charities, however, these 
charities cannot accept large quantities 
of perishable food with limited refriger-
ator space and a shortage of volunteers. 
As a last resort, farmers have buried 1 
million onions in ditches, plowed fields 
of fresh vegetables back into the ground 
and smashed eggs that they could not 
sell. Additionally, many dairy farmers 
have begun dumping milk. 

Milk 
processing 
plants 
have 

decreased how much milk they accept 
from farmers, and unfortunately, you 
cannot stop milking a cow abruptly. 
Cows fall into a routine based on how 
many times a day they are normally 
milked and if they are milked less than 
that, it causes pressure to build up which 
can lead to serious medical conditions 
for the cow. This leaves dairy farmers 
with no other option except to milk their 
cows and dump the milk. However, 
for the dairy industry, their customer 
base began decreasing years before the 

COVID-19 pandemic began. 

Since 1975, milk consumption per 

capita has dropped by 40 percent. 
Recently, plant and nut-based milks 
have become a millennial trend. There 
are a plethora of options now available: 
soy milk, almond milk, rice milk, coco-
nut milk, oat milk, etc. Many of these 
types of milk still carry high nutritional 
value minus the fat and calories found in 
dairy milk. For example, unsweetened 
soy milk has almost the same amount of 
protein found in dairy milk and 11 grams 
less sugar. In 2018 alone, cow milk sales 
decreased 6 percent whereas plant-
based milk sales increased 9 percent. 
That same year, 2,700 dairy farms in the 
US shut down. In addition to non-dairy 
alternatives, these farms were also run 
out of business by environmental aware-
ness, animal rights and industrial dairy 
competition. 

About 3.6 percent of planet-warm-

ing emissions each year are due to the 
production of dairy products. Carbon 
dioxide and other harmful gases are 
released from dairy cows, manure and 
wastewater on farms where manure 
and fertilizers are not handled properly. 
According to the Institute of the Envi-
ronment & Sustainability at the Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles, if one 
person chooses oat milk instead of dairy 
milk, they can decrease carbon dioxide 
emissions by 71.8 kilograms in a year, 
assuming they drink two gallons per 
month. However, some of the nut-based 
dairy alternatives have large impacts on 
the environment as well. For example, it 
is estimated that it takes 15.3 gallons of 
water to produce only 16 almonds.

The abuse of dairy cows surfaced in 

the news last June, when a viral video 

was released that exposed the mistreat-
ment of animals on Fairlife Dairy farms. 
Fairlife claims that they strive to pro-
vide a quality of life for their cows that 
minimizes mental stress and avoids pain, 
however, the graphic video of employees 
kicking and throwing calves suggests 
otherwise. This company is likely not the 
only one in the dairy industry lying on 
their labels. The practice of dairy farming 
in itself seems far from ethical. Cows are 
intentionally impregnated and then their 
calves are taken away from them at birth. 
The milk from the mother is bottled for 
humans, instead of used as nutrients for 
her calf. Furthermore, if the calf is male, 
farmers either kill the calf themselves or 
hire a knackerman to perform the job.

Large-scale dairy farming has taken 

over and forced many family businesses 
to close their farms. Post-COVID-19 pan-
demic, it is doubtful that any small dairy 
businesses will survive. For example, 
in Wisconsin, the number of industrial 
dairy farms increased by 55 percent 
within the last decade. Other states that 
are top manufacturers of milk have seen 
similar trends. In addition, the COVID-
19 pandemic has put even more pressure 
on these family-run farms, forcing many 
small businesses to close.

Millennials might have some logic in 

their choice to abandon dairy. Shutting 
the door on the dairy industry could 
contribute to the fight against climate 
change, as well as animal abuse. The 
intensified milk market crash due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic could be the 
final step in closing many dairy pro-
cessing plants as well as dairy farms.

O

ver 4 million people around 
the world have now been 
diagnosed with the new coro-

navirus disease, COVID-19. Since major 
countries and cities have enacted stay-
at-home orders to decrease the spread 
of COVID-19, multiple images showing 
empty tourist destinations have gone 
viral. The most famous post was a tweet 
showing the water in the Venice canals 
had cleared enough to see fish. Another 
viral photo going around shows Los 
Angeles’s clear skies, side-by-side with 
a smoggy photo taken weeks before the 
pandemic started, among many others. 

I was in disbelief when I first saw 

these tweets, especially the side-by-side 
photo of Los Angeles pre- and post-
shutdown. I thought they might be 
Photoshopped, but eventually, I started 
noticing changes in my community. 
Within a week of classes being can-
celed and students moving back home 
en masse, the air in Ann Arbor did feel 
cleaner. Maybe it was real, or maybe it 
was just a placebo, my mind trying to 
trick me after seeing those photos on 
Twitter.

As an environmentalist, tracking the 

environmental effects of COVID-19 
has been interesting. In a world filled 
with panic and uncertainty, people 
seem to feel comforted that at least 
Mother Nature is benefitting from this. 
Numerous photos have been posted on 
Twitter and Reddit from users living 
in polluted cities that now have clear 
skies out their windows. Emissions in 
China have been reduced by a quarter 
and air pollution is improving globally. 
By all means, this is great news for the 
environment. However, I am also pain-
fully aware that these effects will be 
fleeting. There has been lots of talk of 
certain aspects of society not going back 
to normal after this pandemic is over — 
we may no longer hug or shake hands to 
greet each other, and some employees 
may shift to working from home per-
manently. Lots of things are expected 
to change. But when this is all over, the 
environment will almost certainly go 
back to normal. Planes will start flying 
again, cruises will continue to dump 
trash into the oceans and factories will 
still pollute. Asthma and lung cancer 
rates will continue to rise due to envi-
ronmental exposures like they were 
pre-COVID-19. The smog will return to 
Los Angeles, and the fish will disappear 
from the Venice canals. We will witness 
the regression of our newly clean envi-
ronment back to its normal state: dirty. 

When this happens — and it will 

happen — I hope it instills anger in 
people as much as it angers in me. A 
global pandemic is not the cure for 
climate change. This pandemic has 
shown that we desperately need sys-
temic change and that our society 
needs to revolutionize its relationship 

with the environment. For the first 
time, we’re seeing that it is possible to 
live in a cleaner world — why should we 
let things go back to the way they were 
when this way is clearly better? When 
we’re allowed to throw parties with our 
friends again, I suspect most of us will 
try to forget this period of our lives in an 
attempt to move on and embrace a pan-
demic-free future. But I hope that peo-
ple will always remember what they 
felt the first time they saw that picture 
of fish in the Venice canals or the clear 
picture of the Los Angeles horizon, and 
I hope it motivates people to fight for a 
permanently cleaner world.

A greener planet is not incompat-

ible with economic growth. Now is 
the perfect time to start funding and 
implementing aggressive climate poli-
cies like the Green New Deal, which 
calls for increased renewable energy 
and green jobs, while we have a head 
start on decreased emissions around 
the world. In fact, some have argued 
that investing in the Green New Deal 
and decarbonizing the economy may 
actually help us with the incoming 
recession. We finally have the chance to 
slingshot ourselves into a future where 
staying below a global net temperature 
increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius — which 
will help to prevent the most extreme 
climate effects like mass animal extinc-
tions and major droughts — might actu-
ally be possible to achieve. In fact, we 
have less than 10 years to do so. 

Yet, rather than prioritizing the 

environment, the government is 
prioritizing polluters by providing 
bailouts to the airline and cruise 
line industries. The Trump admin-
istration has rolled back Obama-era 
policies, withdrawn from the Paris 
Agreement and is currently pushing 
back emissions regulations for cor-
porations, meaning corporations are 
no longer held accountable for how 
much they pollute during the pan-
demic. In fact, air quality in Amer-
ica is currently the worst it’s been in 
years, largely due to these emission 
rollbacks. We have been working for 
decades to lower our carbon emis-
sions to prevent reaching 1.5 degrees 
Celsius, and now that we may be on a 
trajectory to reach that goal, the gov-
ernment is prioritizing the fossil fuel 
industries for the sake of the economy, 
despite renewables being the cheapest 
they’ve ever been. 

Individual action is not enough. 

This pandemic has only emphasized 
that individuals are not the problem — 
corporations and governments are. 

COVID-19 won’t solve climate change

A

mid the pandemic, it’s dis-
heartening to see our coun-
try’s poor response to this 

public health crisis, and daily COVID-
19 updates highlight our nation’s 
inability to separate business and poli-
tics from basic human rights. While 
most of the country has focused on 
bills like the Affordable Care Act and 
Medicare for All, this problem ulti-
mately starts with the wrath of “Big 
Pharma,” a pejorative alias given to the 
pharmaceutical industry and its heav-
ily debated motivations. Big Pharma is 
known for its notorious role in pushing 
overpriced drugs onto desperate con-
sumers with patent brand-name medi-
cation, just like in the case of America’s 
ongoing opioid crisis.

Since the early 2000s, drug com-

panies have focused their efforts on 
profits, spending 19 times more money 
on marketing than on proper research 
and development. This negligence of 
the latter is telling of their prevailing 
misaligned priorities, and there seems 
to be no sign of change amid a global 
pandemic. In fact, industry lobbyists 
have ensured that the aid package 
for coronavirus funding allows them 
to ultimately maximize profits from 
the pandemic with no limitations on 
intellectual property rights for drug 
makers and limited government inter-
vention. Take heart though, this reign-
ing power pharmaceuticals have over 
drug price controls is largely exclusive 
to the United States. Prioritizing prof-
its over basic human health is nothing 
short of outrageous, but after all, it is 
the American way. 

Biopharmaceutical company Gil-

ead recently revisited the antiviral drug 
remdesivir which was first developed to 
treat Ebola. When the first known case 
of COVID-19 in the U.S. presented esca-
lated symptoms at Providence Regional 
Medical Center in Everett, Wash., they 
turned to Gilead’s drug. After being 
approved by the Food and Drug Admin-
istration under “compassionate use,” 
the drug was administered. Compas-
sionate use allows “unapproved drugs 
to be given under select circumstances 
outside of clinical trials.” Note: unap-
proved drug. Remdesivir is still an 
unapproved drug that requires clinical 
trials to prove its efficacy, test its dosag-
es and observe any side effects. During 
a public health emergency, temporar-
ily waived standards for experimental 
drugs are often necessary for prelimi-
nary administration to assess potential 
benefits. 

Even so, the drug was used in hopes 

to ease the burden of the pandemic on 
the health system by not only reducing 
the intensity and duration of the virus, 
but also offering the tiniest sliver of 

hope to us all. However, if easing the 
burden on the health system was ever 
the true goal, abiding by strict pub-
lic health protocols and investing in 
extreme preventative measures early on 
would have been the appropriate course 
of action. While the drug did reduce 
days for recovery in its first patient, 
later trials proved the effects of remdisi-
vir to be insignificant and inconclusive. 
Why, then, was information based on 
preliminary data released to the public 
at all? The answer is disappointing yet 
unsurprising: market manipulation. 
Dr. Anthony Fauci’s, director of the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infec-
tious Diseases, spontaneous announce-
ment of the data was possibly motivated 
by concerns that leaked information 
would cause the stock market to drop, as 
are most actions taken by Big Pharma. 
While the stock for Gilead temporar-
ily rose, the minimally researched rem-
desivir dangerously raised hopes for 
patients in critical condition. The drug 
escalated in demand so much so that 
Gilead stopped accepting requests alto-
gether because they simply could not 
keep up. While the company’s released 
statement alluded to efforts focused on 
an alternative, the lack of transparency 
from both the company and the federal 
government has yet to offer satisfactory 
information as to how the administra-
tion of the drug is determined and why. 

This mess of insufficient data 

and widespread false hope stems 
from profit-oriented drug compa-
nies that are left unregulated by a 
federal government that is far more 
concerned about its administration’s 
re-electability. Within both, the bla-
tant disregard for anything but their 
self-fulfilling motives is reckless and 
irresponsible. A system that chooses 
to profit off a global pandemic — off of 
more than 300,000 deaths — is utterly 
abominable. It’s cruel to publicize a 
drug that is minimally researched, 
and like infectious disease specialist 
Dr. Andre Kalil said in an interview, 
compassionate use is “treating emo-
tion.” We are all desperate for good 
news, but releasing inconclusive data 
is nothing short of sensationalism. 
Time and time again, pharmaceutical 
profits and public health prove to be 
irreconcilable. The industry ceases to 
invest in research without financial 
incentives, but with current federally 
unregulated financial incentives, the 
industry completely neglects its con-
sumers’ needs in terms of affordabil-
ity and accessibility.

KEITH JOHNSTONE | COLUMNIST

A

s my father drove to 
the California polls on 
Election Day in 1988, 

he heard the local radio broad-
caster announce that George 
Herbert Walker Bush would be 
the 41st president of the United 
States. Even though he knew 
the result, he continued on 
his 30-minute drive and cast 
his ballot for Michael Duka-
kis. When I asked him why he 
would waste his time like that, 
he indignantly replied: “Son, 
our ancestors fought with their 
lives for the right to vote. The 
least we can do is sit in traffic 
and walk into a booth.”

That statement stuck with 

me as I grew up, because it 
forced me to remember how 
much those who came before 
me sacrificed for my rights. I 
needed to make their struggle 
worthwhile by fulfilling my 
civic duty. Thus, Nov. 8, 2016 
shook me to my core — and not 
because 
Americans 
elected 

a former steak salesman to 
the presidency. I was shaken 
because, 
across 
the 
coun-

try, my brothers and sisters 
weren’t voting. Black voter 
turnout fell 7 percent nation-
ally in 2016 from 2012, but it 
fell significantly further right 
in my backyard, the industrial 
Midwest. Black turnout was 
down 7.5 percent in Ohio, 12.3 
percent in Wisconsin and 12.4 
percent in my home state of 
Michigan in 2016 — all states 
that Barack Obama had won in 
2012. While these people may 
not have believed that their 
votes mattered, they effectively 
made Donald Trump the suc-
cessor to the first Black presi-
dent. After seeing the trends in 
2016, Trump’s administration, 
court appointees and Repub-
lican 
cronies 
have 
actively 

sought to deny Black people 
the voting rights for which our 
ancestors fought. 

Since 1870, we have had the 

right to vote regardless of “race, 
color or previous condition of 
servitude,” but this did not pre-
vent state governments from 
taking away that right, through 
methods like poll taxes and 
literacy tests. These practices 
continued until the 1965 Voting 
Rights Act, which enhanced our 
right to vote but immediately 
drew the ire of judicial conser-
vatives who waged war on the 
law following its inception. 

Enter the Roberts Supreme 

Court, which in 2013’s Shelby 
County v. Holder, invalidated 
Section 4(b), which reduced the 
scope of Section 5 of the VRA, 
opening 
the 
floodgates 
for 

Republican states to suppress 
their citizens’ rights. These 
subsequent efforts have been 
met with, at best, a shoulder 
shrug from the court’s justices, 
especially 
Trump 
appointee 

Neil Gorsuch. In 2018, Gor-
such even said that the Voting 
Rights Act does not prohibit 
race-based 
gerrymandering, 

which is such an unpopular 
interpretation that it has only 
been echoed by fellow Justice 
Clarence Thomas. 

Ohio 
Secretary 
of 
State, 

Frank LaRose, a member of 
Trump’s inauguration team, 
took the Court’s decided con-
servatism and Trump’s elec-
tion as a signal to begin purging 
the voter rolls. Upon his 2018 
election, LaRose ordered the 
state’s 
88 
county 
election 

boards to begin purging more 
than 460,000 voters from the 
state’s rolls. However, once 
the flawed process garnered 
scrutiny for erroneously purg-
ing thousands of Ohioans from 
the state’s most diverse areas, 
LaRose backtracked, calling 
their system “unacceptably 
messy.” Though these voters’ 
registrations have since been 
restored, the state of Ohio 
has not taken any additional 
actions to make sure that fur-
ther such “software glitch(es)” 
will not occur.

In 2020, following Ohio’s 

lead, Wisconsin’s Board of 
Elections released a list of 
nearly 209,000 voters whom 
they will purge from the rolls, 
most of whom vote Democrat-
ic. However, the board’s Dem-
ocrats delayed those purges 
until after the 2020 election. 
Then, liking their chances in 
the court system, Republicans 
filed a suit to force Wisconsin 
to purge the rolls immediate-
ly. While actively litigated in 
the courts, the board’s Repub-
licans have ramped up the 
rhetoric, calling Democrats’ 
efforts “terribly disgusting” 
and disparaging the outra-
geous process.

Now, Republicans in these 

states have argued that these 
restrictions are necessary to 
maintain accurate voter rolls 

and prevent voter fraud in 
accordance with the National 
Voter Registration Act of 1993. 
While the law was written to 
make voter registration easi-
er, its provision empowering 
states to maintain accurate 
voter rolls has given wide dis-
cretion to Secretaries of State; 
some of whom have abused 
this vast power in the name of 
“election security.” 

Now, don’t get me wrong, 

the integrity of our elections 
is a valid concern, as they are 
core to our democracy. How-
ever, the in-person ballot fraud 
rate is between 0.0003 percent 
and 0.0025 percent, which is 
about nowhere near the level 
that could potentially affect 
a Detroit City Council race, 
nevermind a national elec-
tion. Further, restrictive voter 
ID laws have disenfranchised 
minority and young voters 
with almost surgical precision 
because these voters are less 
likely to have “valid identifica-
tion,” which somehow includes 
a gun license but not a student 
ID. 
From 
restrictive 
voter 

ID laws in Texas to blocking 
53,000 new voter registrations 
in Georgia to the aforemen-
tioned suppression in Wiscon-
sin and Ohio, Republicans in 
certain states have shown us 
all one thing — they’re scared 
of our votes, and, quite frankly, 
I understand why. 

On Jan. 20, 2009, my whole 

family gathered to watch a 
charismatic Black man with a 
wide grin and funny ears take 
the oath of office. Though I 
was only nine, I took in the 
moment and thought for the 
first time that one day I could 
be the president of the greatest 
country on Earth. As he uttered 
those famous words, the room 
erupted in applause, as did the 
National Mall because we saw 
that when Black people unite 
together to fight against the 
system, we can accomplish 
previously unimaginable feats. 
On Nov. 3, 2020, we need to 
speak strongly with our votes 
to turn the page on the Trump 
era, and we can only do that by 
actively registering ourselves 
and our neighbors to ensure 
that we can exercise the rights 
for which our ancestors died.

COVID-19 has given the phrase “bedroom 

pop” a whole new meaning. High profile musi-
cians across the world have flocked to video 
conferencing and streaming platforms like 
Zoom and Instagram Live to perform and chat 
with fans more than ever before, often from 
the comfort of their bedrooms. British singer 
and experimental pop superstar Charli XCX 
took this ascending intimacy between artist 
and listener and cranked it up to the max. Her 
new record how i’m feeling now was recorded 
and produced at lightspeed — all from scratch 
over the course of a month — 
and Charli documented the 
process live all along the way. 
Fans were able to tune in as 
she wrote lyrics, filmed music 
videos and collaborated with 
pop music’s most cutting-
edge producers, providing an 
intimate look into the synthe-
sis of an electropop gem.

The project began on April 

6 when Charli announced 
it on a Zoom call. She sim-
ply said she was starting a new album from 
scratch, promised to open up the creative pro-
cess to her fans and set a release date just over 
a month away. And thus Charli and her fans 
embarked on a grand pop music experiment, 
every day between announcement and release 
being a part of the journey to how i’m feeling 
now. Charli modeled in “photoshoots” (pic-
tures her boyfriend took on his phone in their 
bedroom) that were shared with and edited by 
countless artists to make alternate covers for 
each new single, ranging from professionally 
designed album covers to humble fanart. She 
live streamed with an eclectic bunch of musi-
cians, celebrities and public figures including 
Paris Hilton and 100 gecs. And maybe most 
impressively, Charli stuck to the arbitrarily 
imminent finish line she set for herself: The 
polished, full-length LP released without delay 

on May 15.

Making how i’m feeling now was not just a 

cute idea or an experiment — it was an unbe-
lievable success. The final album is a weirdly 
21st-century product of a pandemic, an unbe-
lievably relevant concoction and nothing short 
of brilliant.

Lyrically, how i’m feeling now lives up to its 

title, reflecting the torrent of emotions Charli 
has felt over the months cooped up in her home 
in LA. The album kicks off in an aggressively 
sinister fashion with “pink diamond,” where 
Charli sings maniacally about her desire to 
go out. The hook repeats “I just wanna go 
real hard” almost like a broken robot, a party 

animal’s internal breakdown. 
She describes her attempts to 
manifest party energy while 
confined to video chats, singing 
“Watch me shine for the boys 
and the cameras / In real life, 
could the club even handle us?” 
She doubles down on this senti-
ment near the end of the album 
on “anthems,” featuring a verse 
she wrote on Instagram Live 
that actually evolved based on 
fan input. One of the most gut-

ting lines in the verse that gets to the heart of 
Charli’s primal party urges — “Wanna feel the 
heat from all the bodies” — was actually sug-
gested by a fan on the livestream.

For the most part, this is a love album. Charli 

oscillates between a sense of impending doom 
for her relationship and a romantic renaissance, 
a spectrum of emotional discord that captures 
the highs and lows of love in quarantine. 
Where the heartfelt balladry of “forever” is a 
musical sendoff for a relationship on its last leg, 
the romantic nostalgia of “7 years” acknowl-
edges a shift from distance to inseparability. At 
times these emotions are captured in musical 
delirium, with intense infatuation on “claws” 
and conflicted paranoia on “detonate.” vocals 
suiting the lovesick lunacy within the lyrics.

It’s said that every theater is inhabited by 

at least one ghost, and contrary to legends 
propagated by Halloween, these ghosts do 
not like the dark. Thus, when the curtain 
falls and a theater’s house empties, an 
employee will leave a light — a ghost light — 
to burn onstage until the performers return. 
Across the world, ghost lights have remained 
on and untouched for months. But the lives 
of performers continue offstage, each day 
adding pressure to find performance spaces 
on digital platforms. What happens when 
the ghost lights keep burning and we’re 
left with a stage wholly mediated by posts, 
shares, comments and likes? 

The New York City Ballet sent its danc-

ers home and closed its doors on March 
26, a month before the company was set to 
begin its 2020 spring season. At the time, 
NYC museums and cultural centers had 
already been shuttered and dance compa-
nies around the world were simultaneously 
lowering their curtains. Ballet schools fol-
lowed a similar pattern: Suspended classes 
became virtual or cancelled and end-of-
year recitals became objects of distant 
memory. Within a few weeks, dancers of 
all ages began the harsh transition off the 
stage and away from the studio. Dancers, 
notorious for their inability to stand still, 
stood frozen at a collective crossroads of 
where to turn next. 

Then, the side projects started: NYCB 

Principal Dancer Megan Fairchild 
launched a series of fascinating interviews 
with other industry professionals, Cloud & 
Victory dancewear owner Min Tan started 
her #GoodBalletJuju podcast and NYCB 
Principal Tiler Peck joined the list of many 
professionals who took to Instagram Live 
to teach ballet class. 

Peck’s classes quickly became arche-

types of a ballet world in quarantine: an 
elite figure spending her time democratiz-
ing ballet for her digital family. Peck is one 
of the many dancers to have increased her 
online presence in the last few months, 
and she’s arguably the most successful. 

A class with Tiler Peck would normally 

be considered an expensive anomaly, most 
likely reserved for the occasional celebrity 
workshop. Now, anyone from anywhere 
can become Peck’s student. She has taught 
a rigid six-days-a-week schedule for almost 
two months now, providing asynchronous 
feedback to dancers who tag her in their 
posts and never asking for compensation in 
exchange for such dedication. The process 
is a beautiful gift of educational generos-
ity — ballet training has never been easier 

to come by. 

The generosity doesn’t stop at just bal-

let. Most every day, Peck also invites a 
new guest from her seemingly endless list 
of artistically gifted friends to join her on 
Instagram. Broadway stars, ballet legends 
and Juilliard graduates make up a few of 
the categories featured. Each day, Peck 
and her guest offer a quick collaboration 
for one section of class. On April 2, “The 
Little Mermaid” Broadway actress Sierra 
Borgess sang “Part of Your World” while 
Peck danced an adagio combination. A 
few days later, former NYCB Principal 
Heather Watts took 10 minutes to teach 
Peck’s group the beginning of “Serenade,” 
an iconic George Balanchine composition. 
On April 21, Peck danced to the piano and 
vocals of John Batiste, the musical director 
of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” 

These appearances are more than high-

lights to an already exhilarating online 
experience — they are emblematic of a 
growing camaraderie across artistic fields. 
Ballet is an art form marinated in a history 
of haut monde audiences who kept their 
content segregated from much of the larger 
artistic world. Tradition can sometimes be 
the most beautiful part of ballet, but when 
that tradition swerves too far toward pre-
serving elitism it can also turn dangerous. 
Coronavirus may be fast-tracking ballet’s 
transition away from such danger. 

As dancers on Instagram erode layers of 

distance between audience and performer, 
Peck offers a quintessential example of 
this change: A ballet class usually occurs in 
a studio with a wooden barre and a special 
floor accompanied solely by classical piano 
music. Now, Peck and her almost 200,000 
followers take class from kitchens and 
basements, accompanied by Broadway lyr-
ics and supported by whatever floorboards 
or carpeting one’s home offers. Old bound-
aries crumble every day, offering glimpses 
into a new world of balletic accessibility. 

Last Thursday, Peck’s guest may have 

been a familiar face to Ann Arbor audi-
ences: Michelle Dorrance, the Mac Arthur 
“Genius” tap dancer who brought her com-
pany to the Power Center in late February. 
Dorrance used a nuanced control of her 
tapping feet to create rhythm for Peck’s 
ballet combination. Much like the Febru-
ary performance, Dorrance’s contribution 
was a crisp explosion of brilliant sound 
created solely by her two feet. The collabo-
ration was suggestive of ballet’s new syn-
ergetic horizons, and Dorrance and Peck’s 
enthusiasm offered new perspectives on 
what constitutes music, what constitutes 
movement and the suddenly possible new 
intersections between the two.

how i’m feeling now

Charli XCX

Asylum Records


This piece is part of a series on “Art during 

COVID,” an exploration of art forms to keep 
our idle minds creative during this pandemic. 
With many of us at home, our minds have 
ample time to wander, wonder and create. 
This series highlights accessible and immer-
sive art forms to both produce and consume 
during the pandemic months and beyond.

I’m sure every Ann Arbor student 

remembers where they were when they 
heard the news that would change the rest 
of their semester. I was standing by the stor-
age cubicles of aUM Yoga Studio when my 
phone started erupting with text messages: 
University classes were moving online. 
Overwhelmed by the sudden flood of infor-
mation, I powered my phone off, folded it 
inside my jacket and tucked the bundle deep 
inside the cubicle. I could afford to stay in 
denial for one more hour. 

As I walked into the yoga room, the irony 

of it all hit me: I’d received life-changing 
information seconds before starting a yoga 
class, a space that encourages detaching 
from the external world and turning your 
attention inwards. I heard jittery whispers 
as I unrolled my mat, all in disregard of 
the sign hung on the front door, “We honor 
noble silence.” 

That March 11 class was one of my last at 

aUM’s studio, located on the corner of South 
University and South Forest Avenues. Less 
than a week later, aUM Yoga owner Jessie 
Lipkowitz decided to move all classes to a 
virtual platform, as did other yoga studios in 
downtown Ann Arbor. Shortly after, I found 
myself in my childhood home, isolated from 
my friends and sorely missing Ann Arbor. 

But I didn’t give up my yoga practice. 

After frustrating hours of online classes, 
too much screen time and too little social 
contact, an hour of yoga has kept me going 
from day to day. I see yoga as art for the 
body. By the end of a practice, I’ve created 
something — a series of movements, a new 
energy, a cultivated breath. My body is the 
vehicle that creates and carries this energy 
and breath, allowing it to execute postures 
and balances. I take comfort in knowing 
that this art can be created with virtually 
no materials or preparation, but can be just 
as exciting and cathartic as painting a mas-
terpiece. 

If you’ve been hesitant to try yoga, I 

was once in your shoes. I was skeptical of 
exercising in a sauna-like room, of judge-
ment from other students, of the countless 
Lululemon logos emblazoned on leggings, 
sports bras, even yoga mats. At the same 
time, I knew that yoga had often received 
the short end of the stick, labeled as a rich 
people’s form of exercise, an exaggerated 
form of spirituality, movement shrouded 
with mystical meaning. After three years of 
practicing, the expense and branding asso-
ciated with yoga still bothers me. But if you 
can put this aside and focus on the art itself 
(which can be accessed on free platforms), 
the benefits are unparalleled. 

The health advantages of yoga are well 

known. Many osteopathic medical schools 
in the U.S. include yoga in their curriculum 
as a form of preventative medicine and nat-
ural healing. For me, the emotional benefits 
of yoga have been the reason I come back to 
my mat every day. A yoga practice forces me 
to remember that my mental strength is just 
as valuable as my physical strength. Even if 
I start a class relaxed and calm, I somehow 
come out even more grounded and mindful. 
It’s a feeling that I want everyone to experi-
ence.

Yoga practice: a balm

SUMMER SERIES

‘Moominvalley’ is a 
cozy, profound show

Many unexpected developments have 

happened over the course of the past several 
months, but for me, the most unexpected has 
been my new-found love for a family of furry 
hippo-like trolls. It started at the beginning 
of the fall semester, when I noticed a stuffed 
hippo-creature my Finnish friend had. I 
asked what it was, and she informed me that 
it was a “Moomin,” a cartoon troll that’s 
immensely popular in Finland. I didn’t give 
the matter much thought, and the Moom-
ins receded from my mind for much of the 
next six months, rearing their heads every so 
often to remind me of their existence. 

Fast-forward to around the start of quar-

antine. I already felt pretty homesick for 
Ann Arbor, and was rather dejected, if not 
totally bored, by the entire situation. I sup-
pose this primed me for the pending visit 
by the Moomins, because they soon inched 
back into my periphery, thousands of miles 
from Finland, in the form of music. More 
specifically, music from an animated Finn-
ish television series called “Moominval-
ley” that premiered in 2019. The series’ 
soundtrack and list of featured artists hap-
pened to appeal to my favorite genres of folk 
and indie-pop (which is probably why Spo-
tify recommended it to me in the first place), 
and so I happily let the soft and upbeat melo-
dies envelope me, at first not realizing the 
origins of the song. 

After listening to the first track, I checked 

the album it was from and, to my surprise, 
there was a group of Moomins staring back 
at me. In spite of my bewilderment, I lis-
tened on. This was the point of no return, 

and there was no averting the collision 
course I was on with the Moomins. It wasn’t 
long after that my curiosity gained the better 
of me, and, wanting to hear the songs in con-
text, I watched the first episode of the 2019 
adaptation. And then another. And another. 
Needless to say, the Moomins were just what 
I needed while isolated in quarantine.

As it turns out, the Moomins are much 

more profound than I at first believed. Cre-
ated by Finnish-Swedish writer Tove Jans-
son in 1945, the Moomins are a family of 
trolls consisting of Moominmamma, Moom-
inpappa and their son, Moomintroll. Stories 
typically follow Moomintroll and the adven-
tures he has with his friends. Debuting in 
a series of children’s books, the Moomins 
were surprisingly progressive for their time 
— Jansson wove feminist and queer themes 
throughout her stories, using her charac-
ters to encourage acceptance of these ideas. 
Maybe it was Jansson’s openness about 
her own bisexuality, or her being raised by 
accepting parents, but regardless of the rea-
son, Jansson’s creations have always rein-
forced the importance of unabashed love. 

However, these elements weren’t what 

drew me into “Moominvalley.” Though the 
sincere stories added to the charm, the show 
itself was a source of radiance and warmth. 
I went for a walk through the woods the 
other day, and as the warm sunlight filtered 
in through the trees and the leaves crunched 
beneath my feet, I felt relaxed. Watching 
“Moominvalley” felt a bit like that. The way 
that the animation worked in tandem with 
the music and story just struck a chord with 
me.

there is no blueprint to winning the 
presidential election. The election 
season never fails to surprise us. 
Even though it is understandably 
early in the presidential campaign 
calendar, 
there 
are 
notable 

measures we should take before

ANNA MAY WONG

Anna May Wong, whose given 

name is Wong Liu Tsong, is widely 
considered as the first Chinese 
American film star. Growing up 
outside of Los Angeles’ Chinatown, 
she and her older sister persistently 
suffered racial bullying. Wong 
taught herself how to act by 
studying films at local movie 
theaters. First as an extra in “The 
Red Lantern,” and soon landing a 
role in “The Toll of the Sea,” she 
developed a fan base over time. 
She pioneered the American film 

industry when many states had 
anti-miscegenation 
laws, 
racial 

conventions 
which 
prevented 

on-screen 
biracial 
displays 
of 

affection or embracement, and yet 
American filmmakers continued 
to refuse to give her a romantic 
leading role. And for Chinese roles, 
Hollywood producers would prefer 
Hungarians, Mexicans and Native 
Americans, 
which 
ultimately 

caused Wong to leave the States in 
1928 and find success. 

VINCENT CHIN 

Chinese American Vincent Chin 

was beaten to death in the summer 
of 1982 by two white men. His 
death inspired a push for Asian 
American rights. Chin was born 
in Guangdong province in China, 
grew up in Detroit and worked 
in his hometown in computer 
graphics. He was working in Detroit 
when automotive manufacturing 
was in decline and many American 
auto workers blamed Japanese car 
manufacturers. Thus, when he and 
his friends went to a strip club to 
celebrate his engagement, Chrysler 
Foreman Ronald Ebens and his son, 
Michael Nitz who had recently lost 
his job at Chrysler beat Chin to 
death, mistaking him for Japanese. 

All the men received a $3,000 fine 
and no prison time.

While Chin’s murder didn’t 

make national news, Ebens and 
Nitz’s lack of sentences sparked 
protests across the country; before 
there were some instances of pan-
Asian American activism, but his 
murder marked a turning point for 
all Asian American communties 
who previously didn’t identify with 
“Asian American” interests. 
DUKE KAHANAMOKU

Olympic gold medal-winning 

Hawaiian surfer and swimmer 
Duke Kahanamoku, or in full 
known as, Duke Paoa Kahinu 
Mokoe Hulikohola Kahanamoku, 
was known as the greatest freestyle 
swimmer in the world for several 
years. He was famously known 
for developing the flutter kick, 
which replaced the scissor kick. 
Kahanamoku is considered the 
father of modern day surfing, 
as he is solely credited with the 
popularization of surfing across 
the globe in the 1920s. 

He has set three swimming 

world records in the 100-yard 
freestyle (from 1913 to 1917) which 
have been universally glorified. 
He became a Hawaiian icon, as he 

founded the first surf club, was 
voted Sheriff of Honolulu over 10 
times and his funeral in 1968 was 
the biggest Hawai’i had ever seen. 
DR. HO FENG-SHAN

Ho Fen-Shan was the Chinese 

Consul-General in Vienna who 
issued Chinese visas to Jews in 
Vienna, despite clear order from 
his superiors. There was an intense 
pressure for 185,000 Jews to 
leave the country after Austria’s 
annexation to Nazi Germany, and 
Nazis required Jews have entry 
visas or boat tickets in order to 
leave. Unfortunately, many of the 
world’s nations refused to change 
their 
restrictive 
immigration 

policies. Because of his work, 
Ho is considered the “Chinese 
Schindler” as many people believe 
he saved more than 5,000 lives, and 
was probably the first diplomat to 
truly take action to save the Jewish 
community.

The visas Ho gave out were 

unique, as they were solely for 
Shanghai, an open port city without 
immigration controls and was 
occupied by the Japanese army, 
thus anyone could enter without 
a visa. His visas didn’t require 
everyone to travel to Shanghai, 

as they were able to use them to 
escape to other countries such as 
the United States, Palestine and 
Philippines. 

DALIP SINGH SAUND

Dalip 
Singh 
Saund 
was 
a 

American politician who served 
the 29th District of California for 6 
years, and was the first Sikh, Asian 
and Indian American elected as a 
voting member of the United States 
Congress. Saund was first a lettuce 
farmer and a distributor of chemical 
fertilizer in the Imperial Valley of 
California. When he achieved his 
American citizenship in 1949 and 
was elected judge of Justice Court 
in 
the 
Westmoreland 
Judicial 

District 
in 
Imperial 
County, 

California, he was denied his seat 
for not having his citizenship for 
one year. He was elected as judge 
once again in 1952 and also served 
as a California delegate to the 
Democratic National Conventions. 

Throughout 
these 
elections 

Saund’s ethnicity, race and religious 
beliefs were a constant issue and 
interfered with his candidacy. 

1. VOTING IN THE
MIDST OF COVID-19

As of May 20, 2020, Michigan’s 

COVID-19 
cases 
have 
spiked 

to a high of 53,009 with the 
death toll reaching up to 5,060. 
Although 
every 
population 
is 

vulnerable to COVID-19, there is 
an indisputable, unequal impact 
on communities of color. There has 
been a disproportionate amount 
of 
COVID-19 
recorded 
deaths 

in communities of color due to 

underlying health conditions that 
are created by the system. The 
impact of this virus is not limited to 
just the health of our communities, 
but 
it 
engenders 
financial 

catastrophes and even changes the 
way we will vote in forthcoming 
elections. 

Many 
states 
have 
already 

postponed 
primary 
elections 

to avoid large gatherings at the 
polls for safety measures. The 
predicament 
expands 
to 
the 

upcoming presidential election in 
November as many fear a second 
wave of COVID-19 will befall right 
when it is time to go to the polls. A 
very easy resolution to this crisis 
would be voting by mail; however, 
the GOP claims that voter fraud is 
the only reason they are refusing to 
expand this approach. Nonetheless, 
there is absolutely no evidence 
regarding voter fraud being caused 
by absentee ballots. This is just yet 
another way to suppress voting due 
to the historic patterns that reveal 
high voter turnout benefits the 
Democratic Party. Especially in the 

midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
we have to exercise our right to 
vote.

In some states, absentee ballots 

can be requested which allow you to 
vote by mail. This is a sufficient way 

to avoid the virus, yet also execute 
your responsibility as a citizen. 
Absentee ballots can be requested 
through:https://www.vote.org/
absentee-ballot/. Eligible voters 
can also request an emergency 

ballot which can be submitted after 
the deadline for absentee ballots; 
this must be submitted before 4 
p.m. on Election Day.

1. I TOOK TREATMENT AND
RECOVERY SERIOUSLY

How I broke up with my 
breakdowns 

ANA MARIA SANCHEZ-CASTILLO

MiC Staff Writer

This year I battled with psychosis and my 

clinical depression and it changed my life. 
I was confronted with some of my darkest 
demons. I felt out of touch with reality and 
my identity. Illusions and sensations became 
so terrifyingly vivid that my ability to func-
tion in everyday life had been disrupted. 

I saw the darkest parts of my psyche, and 

yet I came back with a completely altered 
perception of the world. I learned that just 
like the outside world, our minds can be dan-
gerous places and this is, to a large degree, 
out of our control. You see, with mental ill-
ness, chemicals alter our perceptions of 
ourselves and our positions in the world. It 
can completely warp the world and how we 
view it, it can completely alter relationships 
and major life decisions. I spent almost a full 
month in an extremely warped state and as 
terrifying of an experience as it was, it has 
allowed me to develop into a stronger, more 
intentional person. It also connected me 
with a plethora of resources and support I 
wouldn’t have had otherwise. Of course, no 
two people have the same brain or journey 
and experiences with these tools may differ, 
but with hard work and support, I am able to 
lean into myself, my needs and I am able to 
feel strong.

Bridging cultures at the
supermarket

It was one of the few days out of the entire 

year that my mom had a day off work. On 
that bright and early Sunday morning, she 
decided there was no better way to spend 
her free time than to go grocery shopping 
with her eight-year-old daughter at Path-
mark, Brooklyn’s equivalent to Michigan’s 
Meijer. Expecting to buy groceries in bulk, 
my mom pulled out her red, four-wheeled 
foldable shopping cart from the living room 
closet. Without a car, we lugged the cart with 
us from our apartment on 7th Avenue to the 
supermarket eight avenues away. 

After enduring the 0.9 mile walk to Path-

mark in the 80 degree heat, I grabbed a 
weekly ad beside the automatic doors as my 
mother searched for a supermarket grocery 
cart in the parking lot. Immediately after 
entering the supermarket, I rushed towards 
every kid’s favorite place: the snack aisle. 
After a brief moment of deliberation, I tossed 
a pack of frosted strawberry Pop-Tarts into 
our shopping cart. 

At the same time, my mom was standing 

in the middle of the aisle flipping through 
the colorful pages of the weekly ad, forming 
a mental list of the items she needed to buy 
that day. Honey glazed ham and La Yogurt 
were must-haves every time we shopped 
here, and we made sure to grab them from 
the deli and frozen goods section. A gallon 
of Lactaid milk, a family pack of boneless 
chicken breast and two dozen eggs later, our 
shopping cart began to reach its limit. 

Before heading towards the checkout line, 

however, my mom suddenly remembered 
that we were running low on cooking oil at 
home. We searched through all twelve aisles, 
passing by shelves holding Bounty paper 
towels, birthday cards and dog food. Still, 
corn oil was nowhere to be seen. At last, my 
mom decided to not waste any more time and 
approached a nearby Pathmark employee, a 
young Caucasian man, restocking the shelves 

with spaghetti boxes. 

With her strong Cantonese Chinese 

accent, she got the attention of the man by 
performing her own rendition of the phrase, 
“Excuse me.” 

“Ex-suh-cu-seh me,” she said with an 

oddly higher-than-normal pitched voice as if 
she were mocking Barbie’s voice. It brought 
shivers down my spine and not in a good way. 

The man put down the box of spaghetti 

from his hands and tilted his head 90 degrees 
to face my mom, giving her a nod of approval 
that he was listening. 

Without knowing how to say “corn oil” 

in English, she began conversing with the 
man using her limited English vocabulary. 
The conversation consisted of her using bro-
ken words and phrases, including “use make 
food” and “help look,” in addition to her 
making gestures of cooking with a pan as if 
she and the man were playing a game of cha-
rades. She looked silly doing so, and I couldn’t 
help but feel second-hand embarrassment. I 
wanted no association with the scene and I 
was sure the employee felt the same. Observ-
ing his facial expressions as she spent a min-
ute trying her best to describe what she was 
looking for, I could tell that he was flustered 
and getting lost in the conversation. 

My mom grew frustrated that he couldn’t 

understand her and called me over to help 
translate. In spite of learning English as 
a second language in school, I was able to 
read, speak and write in English fluently 
— even better than in my native language. 
This made communicating my mom’s needs 
to the employee easy. Asking him, “Where 
can I find cooking oil?” was a simple inter-
action for me. With that one question, he 
understood me right away and prompted us 
to head towards aisle three, where we were 
able to find our oil and finally check out. At 
that moment, I realized how powerful being 
able to speak English in America would be. 

Therapy
Therapy
If your mental health is damaging your 

ability to function optimally or at all, seeing 
a health professional is extremely important. 
Friends and family can be a wonderful sup-
port system, but a licensed professional can 
give unbiased, credentialed guidance. I’ve 
found cognitive behavioral therapy, psychia-
try and music therapy to be the most helpful 
in my recovery. 

Trusting someone and being genu-

inely vulnerable to another person can be 
extremely challenging, but with time comes 
the development of a relationship with a 
health professional that can not only provide 
guidance, but also provide another pillar of 
emotional support.

If you are unable to afford traditional 

therapy, there are a plethora of free mental 
health apps as well as online mental health 
resources, including books that you can cater 
to your personal experience or sentiments.

In the case of an emergency, please do not 

hesitate to reach out to crisis text and phone 
lines. The numbers for these can be found in 
the link above.

2. I SPENT MORE TIME
WITH LOVED ONES

Open to Love
Open to Love
The circumstances of my most danger-

ous depressive episode showed me the value 
of unconditional love. The interactions I 
had with my family and friends during this 
time helped me immensely in my recovery. 
Unconditional love can remind you of what 
you value, ensure you feel supported, show 
you tangible aspects of your reality and teach 
you how to think outside of yourself in your 
current mental space.

Medication
Medication
It was very difficult for me to become 

comfortable with taking medications; it can 

be hard to come to terms with relying on a 
substance to remain balanced. I found devel-
oping a relationship of trust with my psy-
chologist and therapist to be the most helpful 
in making my decision on taking substances. 

Medication is not always accessible, and 

for many people it is against cultural beliefs, 
and this can pose an issue as well. This is 
okay. Take your time, do what you need and 
rely on alternative therapy and the other list-
ed methods. 

Sometimes the chemical imbalances in 

our brains can’t be remedied without the 
help of medication. My tía says it’s like “driv-
ing a car without oil.” Medications can be a 
really sustainable way to balance your brain 
chemicals. Personally, finding the right 
medication has been really helpful in allow-
ing me to sustain my progress — of course it 
may not work for everyone and everyone is 
affected differently. 

Do not feel rushed or pressured to make a 

decision on this matter right away (it took me 
years and I am far from done). Connect with 
your support system and weigh out the pros 
and cons as you see fit. Your mental health is 
ultimately in your own hands and this mat-
ter requires you to be intuitive as well as your 
own biggest advocate, which can be difficult 
in itself.

How you feel affects those who love you 

and your relationship with them. When in 
a deep depressive state, it is difficult to see 
beyond that. That can include the senti-

are experiencing both related and unrelated 
to your situation. By starting to take active 
intention into staying mindful and aware of 
how those around you are doing, I was able

Wake Forest transfer Chaundee Brown commits to Michigan

Just over three weeks ago, 

it appeared the recruitment 
of 
Wake 
Forest 
transfer 

Chaundee Brown was winding 
down when he released a final 
group of suitors that included 
Gonzaga, Illinois, LSU and 
Iowa State on Apr. 25.

That didn’t stop Michigan 

coach Juwan Howard from 
trying to get his foot in the 
door. And now, less than a 
month later, Brown is heading 
to Ann Arbor.

Brown, 
who 
has 
one 

remaining year of eligibility, 
announced his commitment 
to Michigan via Instagram 
on Tuesday. He averaged 12.1 
points and 6.5 rebounds on 
45.6 percent shooting across 
23 games last season, with his 
most impressive performance 
coming in a 26-point effort 
against Xavier on Dec. 14.

The Orlando, Fla. native 

also declared for the NBA 
Draft on Apr. 15, but now 
appears set to return to 
college. Brown is the third 
transfer 
to 
commit 
to 

Michigan this spring, joining 
Columbia graduate transfer 
Mike 
Smith 
and 
former 

Purdue guard Nojel Eastern.

In his three years with the 

Demon Deacons, the former 
top-40 
recruit 
established 

himself as a physical presence 
around the rim. Brown’s 
6-foot-5, 225-pound stature 
will improve the Wolverines’ 
physicality 
on 
the 
wing, 

while his 74 career starts and 
wealth of ACC experience 
could prove invaluable from a 
leadership standpoint.

Though he’s never shot 

above 35 percent from beyond 
the arc in a single season, he’s 
shown an ability to stretch the 
floor as a jump-shooter when 
necessary and knock down 
free 
throws 
consistently. 

That versatility, success and 
experience in a high-major 

conference should translate 
well to the Big Ten. 

Like Eastern, who also 

announced his intention to 
transfer to Michigan last 
week, Brown will not be 
eligible for the upcoming 
season without a waiver. But 
given Wake Forest’s decision 
to fire coach Danny Manning, 
Brown may have a better 
case for immediate eligibility, 
though it’s worth noting he 
entered the transfer portal 
prior to Manning’s firing.

If Brown is ruled eligible 

for next season, expect him to 
carve out a sizable spot in the 
rotation. While Michigan’s 
biggest needs are backcourt 
playmaking 
and 
defense, 

Brown isn’t a conventional 
‘2’ guard. His play style 
resembles that of a strong 
undersized power forward 
rather than a shot creator.

That being said, Brown is 

more than just an insurance 
policy on junior forward 
Isaiah 
Livers’ 
impending 

NBA Draft decision. Given his 
ability to get to the rim, finish 
through contact and cash 
in at the free throw line, the 
Wolverines could easily carve 
out a role for Brown in either 
of the next two seasons.

Without a waiver to play 

this season, Brown would 
be a fifth-year senior on an 
inexperienced Michigan team 

in 2021-22. As of now, the only 
upperclassmen on scholarship 
for that season will be Eastern, 
Brandon Johns Jr., Adrien 
Nunez and Franz Wagner, and 
there’s a realistic possibility 
the lattermost declares for the 
2021 NBA Draft.

With the addition of Brown, 

the 
Wolverines 
are 
now 

sitting at the 13-scholarship 

limit for next season. If Livers 
returns to school after testing 
the NBA Draft waters and 
there is no further attrition, 
Michigan will not be able to 
offer a scholarship to any high 
school recruits who reclassify 
from 2021 to 2020 or any 
more high-profile transfers 
that enter the portal over the 
summer.

Gattis ‘nowhere near’ naming starting quarterback 

Leading up to last season’s 

Citrus Bowl, Josh Gattis 
was already planning for the 
future.

In the waning days of his 

first season as the Michigan 
football 
team’s 
offensive 

coordinator, he knew his 
offense was only months 

away from losing quarterback 
Shea Patterson to graduation. 
So as the Wolverines zeroed 
in on their matchup against 
Alabama, Gattis pulled aside 
backup quarterbacks Dylan 
McCaffrey, Joe Milton and 
Cade McNamara to zero in on 
a matchup of their own.

“This is the opportunity 

right now to start this (starting 
quarterback) competition and 

compete,” 
Gattis 
recalled 

telling them in December.

In hindsight, that trigger 

might’ve been pulled too early.

“It was a little bit unfair 

(at the time), because they 
still (were) not taking the 
reps needed,” Gattis said 
during a teleconference on 
Thursday. 
“They’re 
still 

taking backup reps because 
we had to prepare. Shea was 
our starter — there were no 
ands, ifs or buts about it. … 
But I challenged all three of 
those guys to step up in any 
kind of way, show me that you 
can lead this team, show me 
that you can lead this offense. 
And I met with them after 
practices and I told them, 
‘Hey guys, we’ve got to start 
now.’

“So just challenging the 

mentality 
of 
those 
three 

guys. We want a healthy 
quarterback competition. We 
want a balanced quarterback 
competition where we can 
give those guys the right reps 
needed. We just couldn’t do it 
right then in December.”

The Citrus Bowl practices 

came and went, as did the 
months 
of 
January 
and 

February. Soon enough, it 
was time for a spring practice 
slate that was supposed to 
be defined by the much-
anticipated 
quarterback 

battle.

But 
Michigan’s 
spring 

slate — like every other 
program across the country 
— was canceled amid the 
COVID-19 pandemic, robbing 
Gattis of the opportunity to 
see McCaffrey, Milton and 
McNamara duke it out over 
the course of 15 practices. 
Though leaving spring ball 
with a clear starter never 
seemed likely, its cancelation 
only added more uncertainty 
to the situation.

One 
way 
or 
another, 

someone 
needs 
to 
fill 

Patterson’s 
shoes. 
And 

without a spring slate to 
determine the best candidate, 
one would think the natural 
next step is an examination of 
last season’s pecking order.

Not for Gattis.

“No guy is out front, no 

guy is behind,” Gattis said 
during a teleconference on 
Thursday. “There is no order. 
It’s not based on last year, it’s 
not based on the depth chart 
(from) last year. Those things 
are not important. What the 
depth chart last year was 
irrelevant because we had 
one quarterback who was our 
starter.”

In Gattis’ eyes, it’s the 

same three-horse race for the 
job that he envisioned back 
in 
December. 
Ultimately, 

one of the quarterbacks will 
win the keys to an up-tempo 
offense that returns most of 
its playmakers.

Now entering his fourth 

year 
with 
the 
program, 

McCaffrey 
has 
the 
most 

experience of the group. He’s 
attempted three times as 
many career pass attempts 
as Milton, even after missing 
time due to injuries during 
each of the last two seasons. 
Milton, on the other hand, 
boasts a cannon for an arm, 
and 
he 
showed 
flashes 

of a high ceiling during 
limited playing time in 2019. 
McNamara did not see game 
action last season, but his 
passing accuracy and touch 
drew praise as a four-star 
recruit coming out of high 
school.

Kick all that to the curb. 

To Gattis, it’s an even playing 
field heading into the summer.

“We’re 
nowhere 
near 

having a frontrunner,” Gattis 
said. “We lost our starter, 
obviously. We’re in a three-
man competition, coming into 
the spring, with Joe, Dylan 
and Cade, and no one’s got a 
competitive advantage over 
anyone. We’re excited about 
the guys that we have on the 
roster. We’ve got to solve that 
question later down the road 
when we get the opportunity 
to.

“… Every guy is going to get 

the right opportunity to go 
out there and lead this team. 
When we have that answer is 
when they’ll know.”

As of now, that answer 

remains months away.

As others his age embarked on 

their final year as college students 
last August, Nadav Aaronson set foot 
on campus for the first time. The 
native of Ramot Hashavim, Israel 
was a wide-eyed freshman — at 21 
years old.

Aaronson 
found 
himself 

surrounded by new classmates who, 
at three years his junior, were the 
same age as his younger sister, and all 
had mostly followed the same linear 
path. High school bled into college, 
one a stepping stone for the next.

It’s a path Aaronson wasn’t 

offered. 

“Look at 18-year-old Israelis and 

18-year-old Americans,” Aaronson 
told The Daily. “Americans, they 
graduate high school and they’re free 
to continue in their life, go to college, 
do the stuff they want. In Israel, it’s 
not like that.”

Instead, the Israeli Defense Force 

beckons. 

***

The IDF’s use of conscription 

dates back to its establishment in 
1948. Accordingly, Israeli citizens 
view their service as a right of 
passage. 

“It’s basically what defines us 

Israelites,” 
Aaronson 
said. 
“It’s 

something that everywhere you go, 
every time you meet someone, one 
of the first couple sentences you have 
with someone is about what they did 
in the army.”

As Aaronson enjoyed life as a 

high school senior, his stint in the 
IDF grew imminent. Having already 
turned 18 — satisfying the draft’s 
minimum age requirement — he was 
bound for a 2-to-3 year tour of duty 
when the school year finished. 

On February 5, 2017, his life 

upended. 

“The 
transition 
was 
really 

difficult,” Aaronson said. “To go 
from living at home and being in 
high school with all my friends and 
having a normal life as a kid, it’s 
really different. And at basic training, 
I couldn’t train for swimming.”

It was a predicament Aaronson 

never 
faced 
before. 
From 
the 

moment he took up swimming as 
an eager 10-year-old, the water had 
been his second home. During the 
two-month basic training stretch in 
which recruits are taught military 
fundamentals, his pastime was 
brought to a jarring halt. 

For any athlete, a hiatus from one’s 

sport poses a substantial challenge; 
for Aaronson, the timing could hardly 

have been more inopportune. With 
high school in the rearview mirror, 
he hoped to prolong his swimming 
career at an American university.

Then suddenly, he could make it to 

the pool just twice in an eight week 
span. 

“That was hard,” Aaronson said. 

“I just really wanted to swim.”

Dealt a hand out of his control, 

Aaronson had to choose how to take 
the change. Deciding what to do was 
easy. 

“I just had to have the state of mind 

that I need to do (my service) and it 
doesn’t matter, because everyone 
needs to go through it,” Aaronson 
said. “Basically every citizen in Israel 
has done it. So you just do it.”

It’s an attitude that speaks to both 

Aaronson’s maturity and positivity. 
Israeli citizens had sacrificed in the 
IDF for seventy years; now, it was his 
turn. Dwelling on it wouldn’t change 
the reality. 

With a new outlook in tow, 

Aaronson grew to relish basic 
training and its simplicity. 

“Everyone is wearing the same 

uniform, 
everyone 
is 
shaved, 

everyone is buzzed,” Aaronson 
said. “You have no idea what their 
backgrounds are. I learned from that 
to not judge and think things about 
people from their appearance. I tried 
to understand more about the person 
behind what you see.”

Aaronson 
cherished 
each 

interaction, going out of his way to 
strike up conversations with peers 
from every corner of the country. He 
treasured the time spent swapping 
stories and jokes into the early 
hours of the morning, unbothered 
by the early wake-up calls that 
loomed. Even the draining workouts 

and incessant yelling from his 
commanders became tolerable. 

As Aaronson recounts these 

experiences now, there’s a tinge of 
nostalgia in his voice. He was without 
swimming. But that was okay. It 
would be there on the other side. 

“Sometimes, I would want to 

do other things, want to swim,” 
Aaronson said. “But when I look at 
the big picture, it’s all worth it.”

***

When the recruits were given 

their 
permanent 
assignments, 

Aaronson’s swimming status made 
him one of the more fortunate ones. 

The IDF designated Aaronson an 

elite athlete, subsequently sparing 
him from the front-line combat 
that many of his friends would soon 
endure. His duty would be in an 
office role, leading training programs 
for higher ranked commanders 
and organizing sets of activities for 
incoming units. 

On top of that, he was free to swim 

again. 

Juggling swimming with service 

meant long days — 6 a.m. starts 
and 7 p.m. finishes, with training 
sessions sandwiching a six hour 
stint at the Wingate Base. Aaronson 
concedes that each day was “really 
challenging,” 
until 
he 
put 
his 

situation in perspective. 

“Whoever’s not an athlete goes to 

be a combat soldier,” Aaronson said. 
“Compared to the service that my 
friends did, to see all my non-athlete 
friends having to go into combat, 
I’m just always grateful I had the 
opportunity to combine service and 
swimming.”

Gradually, Aaronson’s dream to

Freshman Nadav Aaronson (left) served three years in the Israeli Defense Force.

Gradually, Aaronson’s dream to 

swim collegiately in America came 
back into focus. Israel lacks wide-
scale collegiate athletics. Amongst 
Israeli athletes, Aaronson said, 
heading overseas is fairly common. 
He’s seen teammates and idols alike 
make the leap after their service. He 
wanted to be next. 

Amongst a slew of options, only 

one school filled his criterion. 

“Really quickly, I found that 

Michigan was something more than 
my individual swims,” Aaronson 
said. “I just wanted to be a part of 
something that is bigger than the 
individual sport.”

There’s a dichotomy between 

swimming, a sport so inherently 
individualistic, and the notion of 
team. Aaronson, more so than many 
of his peers, values the group aspect 
of swimming because of his time 
in the IDF, where his individual 
sacrifices opened his eyes to the 
importance of the whole. 

Michigan coach Mike Bottom 

runs his swimming and diving 
program under a core value system. 

The values, ranging from purpose 
to progress to integrity, span five 
different tiers, each tier designating 
a level of importance. 

One value stands alone at the top. 
“The team is the building block 

of the value system,” Bottom said. 
“That’s what sets us apart from a lot 
of other programs, our focus on the 
team. It’s something that Nadav saw 
in us, and again, it’s a part of who he 
is.

“Nadav, he’s like the glue that 

pulls people together. Everybody 
wants to be a part of that.”

That’s all Aaronson wanted — to 

be a part of a strong team culture. 
That’s 
why 
he 
committed 
to 

Michigan in May of 2018, even with 
his IDF service still ongoing. 

In being forced to put his own 

life pursuits on hold, to look past his 
own swimming feats, to be uprooted 
from his cushy high school life, 
Aaronson found perspective that 
few 21-year-olds have:

“You’re something that is much 

bigger than yourself.”

At the beginning, only local 

schools recruited her — Duke, 
North Carolina, North Carolina 
State — but as more and more 
schools from around the country 
came to visit her and Izabela, 
the offers grew and the world of 
recruiting surrounded her.

In that first round of recruiting, 

Varejão spent little time thinking 
about playing at Michigan. Born 
and raised in the warm climate of 
Brazil, the fear of a harsh winter 
scared her off from committing to 
any colleges that far North.

Yet as the months passed by, 

when Varejão needed to make a 
decision, she was stumped. There 
were no campuses calling her 
name, no schools that felt right. Her 
AAU coach, in the summer before 
her senior year of high school, asked 
her where she wanted to go.

“Coach, I don’t know,” she told 

him. “Like honestly don’t know 
how to decide, when to decide and 
where to decide.”

He made a call to Michigan 

coach Kim Barnes Arico.

“They called and just said 

‘Izabel is open and going through 
the process again,’” Barnes Arico 
recalls. “I said, ‘Well okay, we’ll be 
down tomorrow, how can we get 
down there as soon as we can.’ And 
coach (Melanie Moore) and I got 

on a plane immediately and went 
down and had a home visit with her 
and her family.”

Their sales pitch appealed to 

Varejão, enough to set up an official 
visit. Varejão called her mother, 
telling her about the new school 
and convincing her to make the trek 
up to America to see the northern 
school.

“It was important to her mom 

where her baby was going to 
wind up next,” Barnes Arico said, 
“because her being so far away 
from home, she wanted her to be 
in a place where people could take 
care of her.”

At the end of a recruiting 

Saturday in October, Varejão and 
her family were sitting with Barnes 
Arico at a dinner table. She’d spent 
most of that weekend soaking in 
the campus, confused by a football 
game and bonding with one of 
Barnes Arico’s daughters, who’s 
about the same age as her younger 
brother.

Varejão started gesturing to her 

family that came on the visit with 
her, to no avail. It was time to make 
her decision, and she wanted her 
family to be prepared. Soshe said a 
few words of Portuguese and had a 
quick side conversation with Stacy 
about the commitment. Again, 
she didn’t hesitate to get into the 
carriage.

When told, Varejão swears, 

Barnes Arico jumped two feet in 
the air.

Izabel Varejão’s epic journey through basketball

Six-foot-four and cramped in the 

seat of an airliner, Izabel Varejão 
kept thinking, What am I doing, 
what am I doing, what am I doing? 
Mom?

Suddenly, in that steel cylinder, 

the reality came crashing down on 
her. There would be no cousins in 
Cary, N.C. for her to lean on, and her 
mom was a 17-hour flight away. She 
was landing in a completely foreign 
culture, and the winters would 
actually be cold.

Her brother was six. She was 16. 

And now they were 5,000 miles 
apart.

It wasn’t the first time she’d 

left her home and her family for 
basketball. In October of 2013, at 
14 years old, Varejão had to choose 
between two paths: basketball or 
modeling. 

Days of coming home, tears in her 

eyes, to her mother’s queries and 
torturous periods of self-reflection 
haunted the 14-year old as she 
stared down her first major fork in 
the road.

One path would take her toward a 

modeling career. 

After a months-long process, she 

had been accepted into a trial phase 
in São Paulo to undergo a boot camp 
for aspiring models.

Two grueling weeks later, she 

received offers from three modeling 
agencies, and they all told her the 
same thing: We would love to have 
you, but you would need to lose 15 to 
20 pounds.

The other path was basketball.
As a young child, Varejão wasn’t 

keen on basketball — she didn’t like 
to be touched. Instead, she danced, 
taking ballet and jazz dance lessons. 
But the allure of sport, and a bad 
case of scoliosis, forced her into 
swimming. 

“My parents,” Varejão recalls. 

“Since I was little, they were like, 
‘No matter what you do, if you want 
to just go straight to school, don’t 
care about sports. No matter what 
you do, you gotta do something 
outside of (school).’ You gotta do 
something like exercise, something 
like that.”

Her cousins played basketball, 

her mom played basketball and 
her 
uncle, 
Anderson 
Varejão, 

was a world away in Cleveland, 
playing in the NBA. The sport was 
omnipresent, and as the swimming 
helped her back, she slowly grew 
into basketball. Until another health 

issue appeared.

When she stood, the world spun 

and darkness clouded her vision. 
The faintness overwhelmed her and 
any sport became nearly impossible 
to play. Varejão had anemia.

“I could barely stand up, I would 

almost pass out,” Varejão said. 
“I stopped basketball, I stopped 
everything for almost two years.”

As she recovered, she tried a 

couple other sports before returning 
to basketball. Varejão was good, and 
tall, and with time she became more 
and more focused on basketball. It 
became her passion, her work.

And then, two weeks after being 

given an offer to become a model, 
a scout for a club called Bradesco, 
headquartered 
in 
São 
Paulo, 

watched her play and saw something 
in her. Her talent was clear, her 
vision superb, but she looked a little 
rough around the edges. Still, the 
scout offered her a spot in Bradesco’s 
academy. The offer was extended in 
late October, 2013, the same month 
as the modeling spot.

Of course, there was a third 

option. She could stay home.

Her family lived in Vitoria. Her 

grandparents, uncles and cousins all 
resided there, a key part to her life. 
For Varejão, family is everything, 
and it had just gotten a new addition.

For 
the 
first 
10 
years 
of 

Varejão’s life, her parents tried 
to have a second child. After two 
miscarriages, they managed to have 
a son. She had a brother. When she 
was confronted with the choice of 
what to do with her future, he was 
four. He was just becoming his own 
person, with his own personality.

And now, she had to decide 

whether or not to leave him.

Her father, though, offered her 

a piece of advice that would stay 
with her for life, “Sometimes, the 
carriage just passes by your door 
once.” 

***

Two weeks into living in São 

Paulo, the homesickness set in. The 
store that sold candy down the street 
became less and less appealing as 
she yearned more and more for the 
beach that was omnipresent in her 
childhood. For the friends she’d left 
behind. For her family.

For her brother.
Now, she lived in a house with 

other girls her age, all of whom 
missed their own families.

“It was hard in the beginning, 

and people thought I was going 
to give up,” Varejão recalled. “My 
best friend (Daniella’s) mom, was 
like ‘Can you do it, you know how 

you are, you’re very close to your 
family.’”

At first, she only practiced three 

times a week instead of the usual 
five; she needed time to adjust to 
the rigorous practice schedule. The 
club was built around sport, and 
while Varejão had grown up around 
it, the intensity at Bradesco was 
something new.

She needed to adjust to the 

distance, too, and for that, she 
turned toward her family.

“I had a cousin that lived in São 

Paulo,” Varejão said. “So sometimes 
on the weekends, I’d go to his house 
and stay with a familiar face.”

Her parents were only four hours 

away by airplane, and Varejão, with 
her friendly personality, quickly 
created her own family in São Paulo 
with the other girls at the club.

She caught up to the practice 

schedule, too, and quickly grew as 
a player. The next year, at 15, she 
tried out for the Brazilian under-16 
national team. They cut her. 

The next year, after trying out 

again, Varejão waited to hear her 
name called, to join the team and 
go to Mexico for the Americas 
Cup, representing her country and 
competing at the highest level. She 
never heard her name. She was cut, a 
second year in a row. A second time, 
she returned to her club, dejected.

The dejection wouldn’t last. 

After an injury to one of the players 
above her on the roster, they called 
her, and she immediately pounced 
on the opportunity to go to Puebla, 
Mexico.

First, though, she had to practice 

and join a team that was already 
midway through its preparation. 
Varejão, 
who 
started 
playing 

competitive basketball much later 
than most of the girls on the team, 
is a quick learner, and the transition 
into the team was quick.

Her talent caught the eye of an 

American AAU coach, who ran 
a team in Raleigh, N.C. Three of 
her teammates on that national 
team had already played for him 
for six months, and he had a good 
relationship 
with 
the 
national 

team’s coach.

After one of the practices, he 

approached Varejão and asked about 
her dream to come to America. A 
quick conversation later, he vowed 
to talk to her more about it, but first, 
there was a tournament to play.

The Brazilians made a deep run, 

even bouncing out the Americans 
in the semifinal, setting up a finals 
meeting 
against 
Canada. 
The 

Canadians and Hailey Brown — 

one of Varejão’s future teammates 
at Michigan — won by one point in 
overtime.

From there, the AAU coach 

ramped up his communication with 
Varejão and her uncle Anderson, 
who spoke better English than her 
parents.

This time, when faced with a big 

decision, she knew what she wanted 
from the get-go. Since she was a 
child and begged her father to buy 
her a foldable anatomy book, she 
knew she’d wanted to be a doctor. 
Growing up, her uncle and his life in 
the United State had appealed to her. 
This was the place she wanted to be, 
and when the carriage plopped itself 
outside her door, she didn’t hesitate 
to get in.

Her 
life, 
her 
family 
and 

everything in São Paulo that she’d 
spent two years building up was left 
in the rearview mirror.

***

It was snowing when she landed 

in Cary during January of 2016.

She was first set up with a young 

couple, friends of her AAU coach, 
Eric 
Hemming. 
They 
weren’t 

prepared to handle a 16-year old 
Brazilian, despite their best efforts. 
Awkward months went by as both 
parties navigated this new world 
of theirs, but when things started 
settling down, they left.

They moved, 40 minutes away 

from Varejão’s friends, school and 
basketball team. Just after getting 
settled in, she had to look for 
another host family.

“We found another family that 

could do it that were friends with 
my coach and they were a very 
big family, four kids, one had just 
graduated high school and another 
three were still in school,” Varejão 

recalled. “So they were not driving 
yet, the logistics were really hard 
because they had to take care of 
those three and then me. So that 
was really hard and I had to change 
again.”

In the midst of this turmoil, she 

also switched schools. After starting 
out with her friends Babalou and 
Geassy at Friendship Christian, she 
was uprooted again — this time, just 
down the street to Neuse Christian.

Yet despite the chaos surrounding 

her life, when the turmoil hit its 
hardest, Varejão opened up, instead 
of closing herself off.

“If I struggle, I will find friends, 

or I will look a lot for help,” Varejão 
said. “And also I am very, very, very 
social. I make friends super easily. 
I feel like that helped me a lot. 
Also having other Brazilians there 
helped me a lot, too.

“I make friends very easily, I talk 

to people a lot. I talk to everybody. 
Literally if I’m on the street and 
I’m bored, I’m going to start talking 
with someone and become best 
friends with them, just like my dad.”

On her third host family and 

second school, Varejão was finally 
in a permanent spot in America.

She grew, on and off the basketball 

court. The bond between her and 
her new host family tightened, her 
English improved, her passion for 
biology blossomed and in her three 
years of high school basketball in 
America, Neuse Christian made 
the state finals every year behind a 
troop of talented Brazilians.

Varejão’s 
sophomore 
season, 

Maria Albiero — a guard from 
Londrina, Brazil — drew attention 
from collegiate scouts, eventually 
accepting a spot on BYU. Her junior 
year, the two Iz’s — Izabela and 
Izabel — drew crowds to the small 
Christian school in Cary.
