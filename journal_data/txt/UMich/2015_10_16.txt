Return on 

investment drops 
15.3 percent since

2014 report 

By ALLANA AKHTAR

Daily Staff Reporter

FLINT 
— 
Though 
the 

University’s 
endowment 

continued 
to 
increase 
in 

fiscal year 2015, its return on 
investment decreased by 15.3 
percent from 2014, University 
administrators 
announced 
at 

Thursday’s University’s Board of 
Regents meeting.

The endowment is a pool of 

funds, much of which are received 
from 
donors. 
The 
principal 

amount of the fund remains 
untouched, but is invested and 
grows with interest from year 
to year. The University does not 
spend all the resulting interest, 
resulting in a theoretically never-
ending source of funding.

“You can think of it, in a way, 

as this giant bond … which pays 
out a certain amount of interest 
every year to the University,” 
said Rafael Castilla, director of 
investment risk management in 
the University’s investment office, 
said in a 2014 interview with The 
Michigan Daily.

The 
total 
value 
of 
the 

endowment increased to $10 
billion this year from $9.7 billion 
in 2014, due to a 3.5-percent 
return on investment in fiscal 
year 
2015. 
The 
distributions 

from the endowment, which 
represent 
the 
money 
the 

University spends from returns 
on the endowment, were $292.5 
million this year. In 2014, the 
endowment had an 18.8-percent 
return on investment, and chose 
to distribute $284.4 million.

The 
University 
bases 
its 

distributions on a seven-year 
average 
of 
the 
endowment’s 

value, pulling a set percentage of 
that average value every year. In 
2014, the University implemented 
a reduction to the set percentage, 
from 5 to 4.5 percent annually.

Conversation focuses 
on ‘U’ definition of 

incapacitation

By EMMA KINERY

Daily Staff Reporter

Seeking to gather input on how 

the University addresses sexual 
assault 
on 
campus, 
students 

and Sexual Assault Prevention 
and Awareness Center officials 
gathered in the Michigan Union 
on 
Friday 
for 
a 
roundtable 

discussion. The forum focused 
on proposed updates to the 
University’s 
Student 
Sexual 

Misconduct Policy.

A series of similar roundtable 

discussions 
are 
scheduled 

through Nov. 3 and SAPAC 
Director Holly Rider-Milkovich 
said she has already recognized 
potential improvements to the 
draft since the sessions began 
earlier this month.

“We 
are 
learning 
from 

students every single time we 
do one of these roundtables,” 
Rider-Milkovich said. “We heard 
tonight, for example, that we 
should make clear on the policy 
who is responsible for ensuring 
that 
sanctions 
are 
enforced. 

That’s a really important point, 
and that is not a point we have 
heard 
from 
others. 
That’s 

just one example and we have 

those examples for every single 
roundtable we’ve done.”

The 
roundtables 
are 
the 

second of three stages Rider-
Milkovich said are in the works 
before a new policy on student 
sexual misconduct rolls out next 
semester, as part of a process that 
first began when the policy was 
last revised in 2013.

In 
November 
2014, 
the 

University 
began 
collecting 

feedback from the administration 
and external experts on sexual 
misconduct policies on campuses, 
as well as reviewing how other 
schools around the country were 
addressing the issue.

A University survey released 

in June indicated that 22.5 
percent of female undergraduates 
experienced 
sexual 
assault 

within the past year. A similar 
survey conducted at 28 research 
universities by the Association of 
American Universities, released 
in 
September, 
showed 
about 

30 percent of undergraduate 
women at the University reported 
experiencing 
nonconsensual 

penetration or sexual touching 
by force or incapacitation. That’s 
almost 7 percent above the 
national average.

The 
University 
is 
now 

considering revisions to the 2013 
policy, with a draft of a new 
sexual misconduct policy open to 
student input — an opportunity

Gathering on the Diag 
features prayer, songs, 
personal connections 

to events abroad

By LEA GIOTTO

Daily Staff Reporter

Students 
gathered 
on 
the 

Diag on Thursday night to honor 
victims of terror attacks that have 
taken place in the Israel over the 
past month.

The event, which was co-hosted 

by multiple student organizations 
including J Street, WolvPac, the 
American Movement for Israel 
and I-LEAD, featured prayers and 
accounts from those somehow 
affected by the attacks.

Discriminating 
remarks 

like 
these 
have 
become 

commonplace 
amongst 

undergraduate students on 
our campus. Maybe you’ve 
overheard side comments in 
the back of lecture filled with 
more than 100 students about 
your professor’s accent or 
listened to friends complain 
about having a “foreign GSI” 
in the dorms. Maybe you’ve 
even 
responded 
to 
these 

comments made on popular 
college campus social media 
platforms such as Yik Yak. 
This video series was made 
in an attempt to respond to 
these comments by providing 
a direct perspective and voice 

from our professors and GSI’s 
who 
face 
discrimination 

because of their language and 
culture.

Each interview was done in 

the instructor’s first language.

“Having this conversation 

in English and reproducing 
the same feelings of feeling 
different 
is 
meaningless,” 

said Psychology and Women’s 
Studies GSI Özge Savas.

Speaking 
in 
one’s 
first 

language on a daily basis is a 
privilege that many students 
at the University, including 
myself, have; we are able to 

fully express ourselves 

and easily communicate our 
ideas without second thought 
or fear of being misunderstood 
or judged based on our ability 
to speak a language. To reverse 
this privilege, even if only 
within the scope of this video 
series, will hopefully put those 
of us at the University who 
do speak English as our first 
language, or speak English as 
our only language, in a role 
that we are not too familiar 
with - the patient role of 
translating and understanding 
in language that isn’t your 
own.

From top left, clockwise: “We are a minority on campus, and we do not have a good pathway to raise the community’s awareness of our difficulties and 
to understand and appreciate our efforts.” GSI Yidi Li, from China. “I feel like when they see me and when I speak that they think, in some form, that 
I am a second-class professor.” Professor Luis Felipe Sfeir-Younis, from Chile. “At the end of the day what is really hard, in my opinion is to just be 
yourself, not being fluent.” GSI Claudio Vilas Boas Favero, from Brazil. “Sometimes, I still feel nervous when students talk fast. And when I ask them 
to reiterate again I’d be worried if the students would be like ‘Haha, she didn’t understand me’ and they would be making fun of me in the back.” GSI

‘U’ doctors model 
head of 30-week-

old fetus 

BY TOM MCBRIEN

Daily Staff Reporter

A team of University doctors 

held Conan Thompson’s head, 
trying to decide whether or not 
he would need drastic surgery to 
allow him to breathe. This was 
no normal consultation, however, 
because Conan was no normal 
patient: He was a 30-week-old 
fetus still inside his mother’s 
womb.

In the doctors’ hands were 

3D-printed models of Conan’s 
head, the first 3D-printed models 
of a fetal head used to inform a 
surgical decision. With the accu-
rate physical model, the doctors 
were able to see that their patient 
could be born through a Caesarian 
section instead of a riskier surgical 
procedure.

Conan’s 
mother, 
Megan 

Thompson, had been referred to 
C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital after 
an ultrasound showed a potentially 
dangerous lump on Conan’s face.

“What we worried was that 

when he was born, the lump 
would cover his nose and mouth 
and prevent him from being able 

to breathe,” said Kyle VanKoever-
ing, a resident in the University 
Hospital’s Department of Otolar-
yngology.

When they first saw Conan’s 

case, doctors worried they might 
have to perform an ex utero intra-
partum treatment procedure, or 
EXIT, a complicated procedure 
that involves operating on the 
baby after it has been delivered but 
before the umbilical cord is cut. 
This process is more dangerous 
and more expensive than tradi-
tional births.

The doctors were concerned 

about the lump, but couldn’t tell 
from the fuzzy ultrasound wheth-
er or not it warranted an EXIT 
procedure. The team decided to 
try an MRI scan, since it would 
give them a clearer picture than 
the ultrasound. MRI machines 
take many images of a subject in 
“slices” about two millimeters 
apart. However, VanKoevering 
said, even an MRI wasn’t enough 
in this case.

“When you look at an MRI, you 

look at a stack of two-dimensional 
pictures,” VanKoevering said. “And 
your brain basically compiles that 
stack into a three-dimensional pro-
file where each picture is separated 
by a millimeter or three millime-
ters. But it’s hard to envision the 
detailed anatomy of a tiny infant 
when the MRI isn’t too clear.”

Normally, doctors would pre-

pare what was necessary for an 
EXIT procedure at this point. But 
Glenn Green, associate professor 
of otolaryngology, had another 
idea.

“And so Dr. Green called me one 

night and said, ‘Kyle, do you think 
we could take a special MRI scan 
and make a 3D model from it?’ ” 
VanKoevering said. “And I said, 
‘Well, I don’t know that it’s ever 
been done in a fetus before like 
this…Let’s try it.’ ”

VanKoevering, 
who 
gradu-

ated with a biomedical engineer-
ing degree from the University in 
2007, used computer programs 
to construct a 3D digital model of 
Conan’s head based on MRI imag-
es. He explained that, after the 
modeling, the printing was easy.

“We called a 3D printer in Ann 

Arbor — a local company called 
Thingsmiths — and we asked if 
they would be willing to print 
these models. Of course, we had 
a very short timeframe because 
the kid’s delivery was coming up 
very soon and we were really not 
clear yet on what we wanted to 
do. So we called them and they 
said, ‘Yeah, we can get these on 
the printers tonight and they’ll be 
ready tomorrow night.’ It was less 
than a 24-hour turnaround. These 
things can literally be printed 
overnight.”

The doctors soon had multiple 

models of Conan’s head in their 
hands. Some were opaque to show 
details about the lump, while oth-
ers were clear to show information 
about the bones and deeper struc-
tural aspects of Conan’s face. With 
this new information, they were 
able to see that the lump would not 
pose a grave risk.

VanKoevering said this is just 

one example of 3D printing’s 
increasing impact on medicine. 
Similar techniques could be used 
for other complex surgeries such 
as removing large tumors and 
intricate heart procedures.

“3D printing is certainly a rap-

idly evolving field in medicine 
because it allows such versatility in 
designing models and potentially 
implants to reflect the unique anat-
omy that each patient has,” he said. 
“So I think this is an area of medi-
cine that will continue to evolve 
rapidly over the next five years, and 
I’m excited to see how it goes.” 

This is not the first time Univer-

sity doctors have used 3D print-
ing as a medical tool. In 2013, two 
members of the team — Green 
and Scott Hollister, professor 
of biochemical and mechanical 
engineering — were honored by 
Popular Mechanics for 3D print-
ing a biodegradable splint used to 
save the life of a two-year-old with 
breathing problems.

“In my experience especial-

ly, the problems in communication of pro-
fessors and GSIs who are not native speak-
ers of English begins with the expressions. 
A student, or even people in general, expect 
certain things to be expressed in a certain 
way. So when we, non-native speakers, 
say something that a student understands, 
but we don’t express it in the way that they 
want to hear - or in the way that they want 
to hear even if they just subconsciously 
don’t want to hear it that way - the student 
wants it to be said a different way.”

“I feel like when they see 
me and when I speak that they think, in 
some form, that I am a second-class profes-
sor. At least at first. That they did not get the 
right professor, the one that is blonde with 
blue eyes who pronounces words correctly. 
It could be that in the next half hour that 
changes because I have good reviews. But 
it’s that initial reaction. It is always a reac-
tion that they wish I was a different profes-
sor, one that speaks in English and that is 
really an American, despite the fact that I 
really am a citizen.” 

“When I observe an American GSI in-
teracting with their student I envy their 
relationship knowing full well that I will 
never achieve a connection so natural with 
my own students. Even though I am aware 
that everyone here is coming from such 
different backgrounds, they are sharing a 
common language and culture. Since the 
students share a common culture with the 
American GSI’s, they may move on to a 
completely different conversation and be-
come much more like friends. I always end 
up feeling like there is an invisible wall 
between me and my students.”

“My feeling is if there’s an Asian GSI or pro-
fessor, in the first five minutes when they 
stand in front of the class, If they are able 
to express their way of thinking from their 
heart and express their logic in a way that 
people understand, then the atmosphere 
will be very good and there’s not much of 
a difference. But if in those five minutes at 
the start, their accent is really strong and 
no one can understand, their logic is bad 
and people don’t understand, ... then the 
atmosphere in the class is – you can see all 
kinds of reactions.”

term performance continues to 
rank in the top quartile compared 
to the performance of other 
large university endowments,” 
Kevin Hegarty, executive vice 
president and chief financial 
officer, said Thursday.

Erik 
Lundberg, 
University 

chief investment officer, said 
the investment return is down 
due to lower energy prices — 
the University allocates a large 
number of its investments to 
natural resources — and the 
appreciation of the U.S. dollar, 
which 
resulted 
in 
lowered 

foreign 
investments. 
The 

endowment also suffered losses 
due to high initial estimated 
values for equity and fixed 
income investments that did not 
end up performing as well as 
expected.

However, in a press release, 

Lundberg 
said 
long-term 

performance 
“is 
more 
than 

sufficient to sustain and grow 
the endowment in real terms net 
of spending.”

The University’s endowment 

received 
a 
slightly 
lower 

ranking this year compared to 
other university endowments. 
National experts ranked the 
fiscal year 2015 endowment as 
the ninth largest in the nation, 
down from the seventh largest in 
2014, according to U.S. News and 
World Report. It also went from 
being the top endowment of any 
public institution to being third.

When compared per student 

the 
University’s 
endowment 

rank actually increased this 
year. The funds per student are 
ranked at 88th in the nation, 
compared to 94th in fiscal year 
2014.

Despite 
the 
large 
pool 

of 
money 
the 
endowment 

represents, 
the 
University 

is limited by how how the 
endowment can be spent. Some 
endowment funds are only used 
for specific purposes — such 
as 
scholarships, 
educational 

programs or professorships — 
and thus is not the University’s 
only source of funding.

Twenty-one percent of the 

total endowment distribution 
is also restricted for use by 
the University Health System, 
while another $2 billion goes 
toward student scholarships and 
fellowships.

University spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald 
said 
Thursday 

because of those limitations, the 
University still needs financial 
support from other areas to 
fund other operations, citing 
increases in tuition as one way to 
make up those costs.

The University’s Office of 

Public Affairs states on its 
website 
that 
funding 
from 

external and internal sources is 
critical for University functions:

“The endowment provides 

a margin of excellence for 
the University, but it does not 
replace the unrestricted funds 
coming from state support and 
student tuition dollars.”

LSA 
senior 
Jonathan 

Friedman, chair of Hillel’s Israel 
Cohort, wrote in an e-mail 
interview 
to 
The 
Michigan 

Daily that he wanted to plan the 
event as a way to help the Jewish 
community on campus respond 
to the violence.

“More than just an outlet, (the 

vigil) is an opportunity to be 
aware of the tragedies and take 
a step towards positive change, 
however small it may be,” he 
wrote.

Seven Israelis have died in 

the last month in attacks carried 
out by Palestinians, according to 
The New York Times. Twenty-
eight Palestinians have also died 
during the past two weeks in 
clashes with Israeli forces, The 
Washington Post reported.

A dozen of the Palestinians 

killed were identified by Israeli 
authorities as perpetrators in the 
acts of terror, the Post reported.

As 
recently 
as 
Tuesday, 

attackers have used firearms, 
vehicles, stones and knives to 
carry out the assaults.

LSA 
sophomore 
Elana 

Rosenthal, who also helped 
plan the event, said she wanted 
to emphasize Jewish solidarity 
with Israel in light of the attacks.

“I felt that it was necessary 

to create an event like this in 
order to unite all Jews, and all 
people, of moral conscience to 
declare ‘enough,’ ” she said in an 
e-mail interview. “Our brothers 
and sisters in Israel are facing 
incessant terror attacks. We 
cannot remain silent. We must 
declare that Israel is not alone- 
we stand with you!”

At the vigil, students sang 

Israeli 
songs 
such 
as 
the 

country’s 
national 
anthem 

“Hatikvah,” which means “the 
hope” in Hebrew.

Engineering 
sophomore 

Kevin Wolf also recited a prayer 
in honor of those who have been 
affected by the terror in Israel.

Wolf said he thought having 

the vigil was important because 
many of the Jewish students at 
the University know someone 
personally or distantly who has 
been affected.

“As I was taking the bus here, 

I was just thinking how lucky I 
am that, in this moment, I don’t 
have to be worried about being 
stabbed,” Wolf said. “For my 
sister who lives there, I just want 
her to know that I care and that 
we all care.”

The names of the Israeli 

victims of and those wounded 
by the terror attacks were also 
read on the Diag. The list of 
names, which was updated as of 

Wednesday, included 7 people 
who have died from the attacks 
and 21 people who have been 
wounded.

part of the eulogy for Naama 
Henkin, 
an 
Israeli 
woman 

who was killed along with her 
husband Eitam Henkin. Lev also 
read a statement from Joshua 
Lankin, whose uncle, Richard 
Lankin, is currently in critical 
condition after being wounded 
in one of the assaults.

When asked why she chose 

to read the eulogy aloud to the 
group, Lev said the acts of terror 
have had a big impact on her 
personally.

“I’m Israeli, so it hits very 

close to home,” she said. “I feel 
as though we just want to show 
that we respect the lives that 
have been lost because of this.”

LSA sophomore Josh Blum 

said the vigil was a way for those 
affected on campus to pay their 
respects to the victims of the 
attacks.

“A lot of Israeli lives have 

unfortunately ended very early 
and I think we need to pay our 
respects for those who have 
died because of terror attacks,” 
he said. “This is not a way to 
get peace. You get peace by 
diplomacy. You do not get peace 
by killing one another.”

Oscar winner stars 
in ‘Antigone’ at UMS

By COSMO PAPPAS

Daily Arts Writer

Few plays in the history of the-

ater have attracted so much atten-
tion for their political resonances 
as much as 
ancient 
Greek 

play-
wright 
and 

statesman 
Sophocles’s 
“Antigone.” 
From its role 
as a parable 
of anti-fascist 
resistance in 
Jean Anoihl and Bertolt Brecht’s 
1940s re-stagings to its reception 
as a feminist call-to-arms against 
state power, the questions that 
this 441 BCE work poses will find 
new life yet again this week at the 
Power Center for Performing Arts 
in Ann Arbor with a star-studded 
cast of collaborators.

French Academy Award-win-

ning actress, dancer and artist 
Juliette Binoche will star in this 
production directed by Ivo van 
Hove, former director of Het 
Zuidelijk Toneel in Eindhoven 
and Toneelgroep Amsterdam and 
winner of various international 
theatrical awards. This perfor-
mance features a new transla-
tion by poet, translator, essayist 
and former UM professor Anne 
Carson, who has also previously 
translated “Antigone,” the second 
of Sophocles’s Theban trilogy, 
in an idiosyncratic, thoughtful 
and poignant rendering entitled 
“Antigonick.” However, at van 

Hove’s request, Carson-the-poet 
took a backseat to Carson-the-
classicist, with the script for this 
production a more literal, word-
for-word translation.

“I think this is an analogy for 

the difference between them (the 
two translations),” Carson said at 
a Penny Stamps Lecture on Oct. 
13. “In Antigonick, I tried to take a 
photograph of an apple tree from 
an angle that would capture the 
essence of that apple tree at a cer-
tain moment that I thought beau-
tiful. And in the second version, 
it’s more like I’m taking hold of 
the tree and trying to shake every 
apple down, get every apple off it.”

These performances, as well 

as the dialogue between Binoche, 
Carson and Montreal-based nov-
elist Will Aitken that took place 
at the Penny Stamps lecture are 
a high watermark in Ann Arbor 
arts. This week, local audiences 
have the opportunity to experi-
ence genuinely world-class talent 
bearing upon questions of transla-
tion, performance and interpreta-
tion of this centerpiece of ancient 
Greek theater.

Briefly 
summarized, 
“Anti-

gone” 
presents 
the 
conflict 

between Antigone, daughter of 
the incestuous marriage between 
Oedipus and Jocasta and thus 
princess of Thebes, and Creon, 
king of Thebes. In the course of 
a civil war, Antigone’s two broth-
ers, Eteocles and Polyneices kill 
each other over claims to the 
throne. However, Creon declares 
Eteocles a hero and a Polyneices 
a traitor, forbidding that the lat-

ter be buried. Antigone, whose 
love for her brother borders on 
incestuous (“yet how sweet to lie 
upon my brother’s / body, thigh to 
thigh,” Carson renders in “Anti-
gonick”), refuses his decree and 
buries her brother. Eventually, 
Antigone and Haemon (Creon’s 
son and Antigone’s fiancée) com-
mit suicide before Creon is able to 
deliver the news that he will bury 
Polyneices and will spare Anti-
gone because of the gods’ anger 
over his decree since the burial of 
the dead is sacred.

Van Hove is sensitive to the 

political implications of burial 
and to the nuances of this play as 
a political work overall. He says 
in the University Musical Society 
program booklet that “ ‘Antigone’ 
develops from a play about a bru-
tal war into a play about politics 
and public policies and ends as 
a play about the helplessness of 
humans, lost in the cosmos.”

Philosopher and gender theo-

rist Judith Butler’s 2000 book 
“Antigone’s Claim” is significant 
for its engagement with the play’s 
political, 
potentially 
feminist, 

meanings that every performer 
brings their own perspective to 
bear on.

“There’s something in the play 

that is very reachable, accessible, 
you understand immediately in 
your life and our society, because 
we need to heal something about 
our family, about our society, 
about our world,” Binoche said 
in an interview with UMS. “Anti-
gone is a healer somehow, even if 
she chooses to sacrifice herself.”

that students have already taken 
advantage of more than during 
past reviews. Rider-Milkovich 
said while only 70 students 
responded to an online feedback 
form during the last update 
to the policy, this year more 
than 225 people have already 
responded in the three weeks it 
has been online. The form will 
remain open until Nov. 6.

During Thursday’s discussion, 

attendees raised concerns about 
several definitions in the policy 
relating to ability to give consent.

The current proposed draft 

does not set to change the 
definition of consent, but it 
does 
propose 
changing 
the 

definition of coercion, force 
and incapacitation, the former 
of which was a main focus of 
discussion.

The proposed definition for 

incapacitation reads, “A person 
who is Incapacitated cannot 
Consent 
to 
sexual 
activity. 

A person is Incapacitated if 
they are asleep, unconscious, 
intermittently 
conscious, 

unaware that sexual contact is 
occurring, or lack the physical 
and/or mental ability to make 
informed, rational judgements. 
Incapacitation 
may 
result 

from 
the 
consumption 
of 

alcohol or other drugs. Where 
alcohol or drug use is involved, 
Incapacitation is a state beyond 
intoxication, 
inebriation, 

impairment in judgement or 
‘drunkenness.’ ”

Attendees said they believed 

the current draft definition does 
not specify clearly enough the 
amount of drinks it takes to be 
incapacitated and thus unable to 
provide consent.

Patty 
Petrowski, 
associate 

vice 
president 
and 
deputy 

general 
counsel 
for 
the 

University, offered a second 
potential definition in response 
to the concerns.

“A 
person 
who 
is 

incapacitated 
is 
unable 
to 

temporarily 
or 
permanently 

give consent because of mental 
or physical helplessness, sleep, 
unconsciousness 
or 
lack 
of 

awareness that sexual activity 
is taking place,” she said. “A 
person may be incapacitated as 
a result of the consumption of 
alcohol or other drugs, or due 
to a temporary or permanent 
physical or mental health issue.”

Several 
attendees 
were 

more responsive to the second 
definition. LSA senior Anna 
Forringer-Beal, 
volunteer 
at 

SAPAC and Relationship Remix 
facilitator, said a question often 
brought up is how much alcohol 
is too much alcohol.

“We 
always 
get 
people 

questioning, ‘Well what if one 
person had, like, a drink and 
they’re totally fine. Does that 
mean they can’t give consent?’” 
Forringer-Beal said. “I think the 
distinction on that sliding scale 
is so important, and I think that 
it’s really great that you’re taking 
into account what’s going on 
in terms of how alcohol affects 
people differently.”

Rider-Milkovich said it was a 

difficult issue to put into words. 
In particular, she said the hardest 
cases 
to 
handle 
regarding 

incapacitation are ones in which 
the victim appears lucid but is in 
fact very intoxicated.

“That’s one of the most 

difficult 
situations,” 
Rider-

Milkovich said. “When someone 
is in total blackout but operating 
normally, and especially when 
we’re looking at the test of did 
the respondent know? Or should 
the respondent reasonably have 
known?”

When the topic was revisited 

at the end of the discussion, 
LSA senior Laura Meyer made 

a suggestion to help clarify the 
definition of drunk.

“You know how the Inuit have 

like 200 words for snow? I feel 
like college students have 200 
words for when they’re drunk,” 
Meyer said. “Maybe using other 
words like tipsy or buzzed, and 
beyond buzzed or beyond tipsy.”

Several other draft changes to 

the policy, including improving 
interim measures to protect 
parties 
in 
an 
investigation, 

increasing 
academic 
support 

for survivors, deciding who 
should choose the student who 
would be on the advisory board 
and whether or not to identify 
witnesses in cases were also 
discussed Thursday.

LSA senior Fabiana Diaz said 

she would like to see the creation 
of a position to deal specifically 
with student needs while a case 
is still being processed and 
sanctions haven’t been decided.

For example, Diaz said, under 

the current situation, students 
living in the same dorm as an 
alleged assailant have to inform 
University Housing if they want 
to change their living situation, 
who then contacts someone 
else and so on, drawing out the 
process.

“It’s not just like you contact 

somebody and I think that’s 
frustrating for the survivor — 
it’s like we’re going in circles 
to make sure these things are 
actually enforced,” Diaz said.

Rider-Milkovich agreed with 

Diaz and suggested following 
a model other campuses use of 
assigning one person to work 
with the survivor of a sexual 
assault throughout the entire 
process instead of having to go to 
several different contact offices 
to address different issues.

The suggestion found favor 

with the room, with several 
people verbally responding yes 
and others clapping in result.

4A — Friday, October 16, 2015

O

ur GSI gave us two articles to read 
before a class discussion on the 
Democratic presidential debate. One, 

written by the New York 
Times 
Editorial 
Board, 

titled 
“The 
Grown-Ups 

Take the Stage at the 
Democratic 
Debate,” 

contrasted the debate with 
the 
Republican 
Party’s 

latest nonsense in Congress 
and on the campaign trail.

During 
previous 

election seasons, I might 
have complained that the 
obviously partisan piece 
was just an example of 
liberal bias in the media. 
But when the Republican Party seems so 
intent on self-inflicted embarrassment, it’s 
hard to point fingers at anything but the 
party itself.

Republicans are known for professing 

their concern that the United States is headed 
down the wrong path. If the country’s heading 
down the wrong path, the Republican Party 
is leading our country down that path.

Most of the Republican Party prioritizes 

the best interests of the United States. Many 
Republicans formulate and support great 
solutions to some of the country’s toughest 
problems. But the John Kasich- and Bob 
Corker-type candidates are almost always 
overshadowed by the Donald Trumps and Ted 
Cruzes; in other words, the far right. 

Very few Republican leaders are from the far-

right wing of the party. The far-right leaders aren’t 
the chairs of powerful Congressional committees 
or the authors of any serious legislation. But they 
are the people who’ve learned to dominate the 
airwaves and use the media industry’s thirst for 
popping headlines to their advantage. They’re the 
Kim Kardashians of the policy world.

The 
far-right 
Republican 
candidates’ 

statements and policies are probably less 
realistic than reality TV; the pictures they 

paint of the world more dramatic. Their 
stories cast medical researchers as baby 
killers and refugees as potential terrorists. 
They oppose support for the “lazy” and 
unemployed, but also for “corrupt” trade 
agreements that are expected to create jobs. 
Some days, we’re teetering on the edge of a 
fiscal cliff; on others, the country’s moral 
depravity will end us all.

These far-right leaders are bombastic and 

inane, but they have an enormous impact 
on and pose a real threat to the GOP. Just 
as the commercial success of “Keeping Up 
With the Kardashians” has fueled both 
the proliferation of reality TV and tabloid 
coverage of its characters, the far right’s 
antics have both inspired political converts 
and earned them the center stage of 
“Republican” news.

They 
proclaim 
their 
extreme 
views 

so loudly that many confuse them for 
the party’s platform. They have adopted 
grandstanding and filibustering as primary 
methods of advancing their viewpoints, and 
Fox News happily broadcasts their usually 
conspiratorial and increasingly racist, sexist 
and homophobic views to the party’s base.

If this continues, the GOP can kiss 

goodbye not only the next election, but also 
any credibility it retains. At the moment, 
Republican politics are entertaining. The 
debates are fun to watch, and record numbers 
are tuning in to watch the circus unfold. But 
few want clowns running the country.

Most Republicans aren’t clowns. But 

unless they take control of policy debates, the 
public won’t know that.

It’s possible that the GOP is scared of 

further infighting splitting the far right from 
the establishment. But retaking control of 
the party’s platform and policies isn’t about 
winning elections or pleasing voters in the 
short term — though those things could 
conceivably happen as a happy side effect.

Rather, it’s about limiting gridlock by 

electing candidates who know how to 

VICTORIA 
NOBLE

FROM THE DAILY

I just had the craziest week-

end, and if I were your typi-
cal college student, you’d know 
exactly what that means. But I’m 
 

proudly atypical.

What follows is the furthest thing 

from a weekend “drunkalogue,” i.e. 
a monologue full of regular shenani-
gans that occur when one devotes 
Friday through Sunday to intoxicat-
ed activities.

I offer you my “soberlogue” from 

the first weekend of October, and I 
can promise you this: It’s way cooler 
than anything I ever did under the 
influence, and I remember all of it in 
vivid detail. What a bonus.

Friday, Oct. 2 
It’s 6 p.m., and I’m leaving the 

WDIV Local 4 news station in 
Detroit, where I intern three days a 
week in their programming depart-
ment. I’m heading to a conference 
in Troy, but not for more work in 
the stereotypical sense — for the 
daily work I do on myself as a per-
son in long-term recovery from sub-
stance use disorder.

I enter the hotel with my guitar in 

hand. I’m welcomed by hundreds of 
others who are, too, in the business of 
staying sober on top of whatever they 
do from 9 to 5 to put food on the table. 
I enter the ballroom. They’re setting 
up the soundboard, the lights and the 
microphone for me and several per-
formers who’ll take the stage after 
the keynote speaker.

I’m on. I step up and strum a 

G-chord, because this night isn’t 
meant to be played in a minor key. I 
say my name is Carly and I’m almost 
five years sober. I’m met with thun-
derous applause. I don’t need this 
approval; I just sometimes need 
reminders that I’m never alone. I play 
four songs in front of a sober crowd. 
They will remember this night, and 
you can bet that I will, too.

Saturday, Oct. 3 
It’s 11:30 a.m. I return to the con-

ference to speak on a panel titled 
“The Sky is the Limit,” where I 
share pieces of my story. I offer 
my experience, strength and hope 
as someone who understands that 
when I’m sober, I’m free to be 
whomever I choose, accomplish 
whatever I wish and go wherever I 
please … like to Washington D.C. for 
a rally called Unite to Face Addic-
tion two hours later.

I leave the hotel and head to 

Detroit Metro Airport. I can barely 
contain my emotions because where 
I’m headed won’t be teeming with 
hundreds of sober people from the 
tri-country area: It will be flooded 
with thousands of recovery advo-

cates from across the country.

What do I wear for such an his-

toric day? I pack far more than I 
need. I stuff a shirt that says, “The 
Only Coke I Do is Diet” into my suit-
case, and I smile. Another G-chord 
moment for me.

It’s 7 p.m. when I land in Baltimore. 

I take a cab to D.C., dump my belong-
ings at my Airbnb and hail an Uber to 
Warner Theater where there’s a pre-
rally, all-star comedy benefit called 
“A Tribute to Lost Laughs” in honor 
of the brilliant comedic minds who 
addiction has stolen from us too soon. 
I’m reunited with sober friends from 
all over Michigan, Southern Califor-
nia, nationwide. We laugh. We cry. 
We feel. Together. In a major way. 

Sunday, Oct. 4 
I’m up at 8 a.m. because I couldn’t 

possibly sleep. Today is Christmas 
morning magnified by a million. 
Today is the day I have been waiting 
for as someone who thought getting 
sober at age 22 meant a life in the 
shadows. This is the day for which 
every recovering individual who’s 
ever been silenced against his or her 
will has been praying.

On this day, we unite to face 

addiction.

I arrive at the location of the rally, 

the Washington Monument, with my 
camera around my neck. I see a giant 
stage. There are already hundreds of 
people here. It’s freezing, thanks to 
Hurricane Joaquin, but I don’t care. 
A little over five years ago, I’d walk 
two miles in the pouring rain for a 
bottle of Jack Daniels on the regular. 
I can weather a little weather in the 
name of recovery.

I find the booth for Transforming 

Youth Recovery, a nonprofit organi-
zation that grants financial support 
to academic institutions across the 
country so they may provide resourc-
es to students who need recovery 
aid on campus. I set up my tripod. 
I’m here to celebrate my own recov-
ery and to be their videographer — 
to document proof that collegiate 
recovery programs, like the one we 
have at the University, are integral 
and save lives.

I speak to a man from Georgia 

who lost his 18-year-old daughter 
to heroin. He wonders if she might 
still be here if she’d had a recovery 
program at her high school. Stu-
dents from Michigan State Univer-
sity, the University of North Texas 
and the University of Vermont all 
tell me they would not be able to 
navigate a college atmosphere — let 
alone stay in school — if not for on-
campus recovery support. I hear 
them, and I am already overcome 

with gratitude by the time the offi-
cial program kicks off at 4 p.m.

Dr. Oz introduces musicians Paul 

Williams and Kasim Sulton, who 
sing an anthem they’ve written spe-
cifically for this event. Everybody 
joins in. Joe Walsh leads a non-stop 
barrage of world-class performers 
interspersed with notable enter-
tainment personalities, politicians 
and public figures such as the sur-
geon general of the United States, 
who firmly states, “I am on your 
side” in the fight to eradicate the 
treatment of addiction as a crimi-
nal justice dilemma rather than the 
public health crisis that it is.

I’m beside myself when one of 

my favorite actresses, Allison Jan-
ney, who plays a recovering alco-
holic on the CBS comedy series 
“Mom,” takes the stage. I under-
stand why she won four Emmys 
for her portrayal as a White House 
press secretary. She’s only trumped 
by the man whose lyrics I carry 
on my arms, John Rzeznik of the 
Goo Goo Dolls. His performance 
is followed by several others who 
I adore, including The Fray, Sheryl 
Crow and, finally, Steven Tyler. At 
the very end of the night, everyone 
joins the legendary Aerosmith front 
man onstage for a rendition of the 
Beatles’ tune “Come Together,” and 
I have never been more grateful for 
my sobriety than in this moment. 

I photograph blue and yellow 

cardboard signs that reflect the 
innermost beliefs of a sea of about 
25,000 people. They read, “Addic-
tion is not a crime,” and “I am a 
person in long-term recovery,” and 
I wish I could linger in this womb 
just a little bit longer.

Monday, Oct. 5
It’s 10 a.m., and I’m back in Ann 

Arbor. I step into my apartment, 
and I break down. I sob hopefully. 
I can’t believe that I get to be alive 
and sober during this groundbreak-
ing social and political movement 
that’s giving a voice to not only 
people living in long-term recov-
ery from substance use disorder 
but also anyone and everyone who’s 
ever been affected by addiction.

From rockstar recovery advo-

cates to atypical college students 
— whether we’re singing songs on 
stages or speaking out on campus 
— we’re just warming up our vocal 
chords and would love to add your 
voice to our choir.

Because harmony is always stron-

ger in numbers.

The Republican Party’s 

far-right problem

D

espite poor success within the past year, yet another bill has 
been proposed in the Michigan House of Representatives to 
ban the sale of “nonbiodegradable” microbeads in personal 

care products. As it stands, the legislation is problematic because it 
does not include a definition of “nonbiodegradable,” leaving room for 
personal care companies to exploit loopholes. If a definition is included, 
such as the one the European Union has, this legislation should be 
passed, but recognized as only a small effort in protecting the Great 
Lakes from further pollution.

Microbeads small part of big problem 

Michigan legislature needs to define “nonbiodegradable” 

Plastic microbeads are found in a variety 

of personal care products — toothpastes, 
face washes, body scrubs — as an exfoliant. 
Companies opt for the use of plastic microbeads 
in their products instead of organic equivalents 
because they are cheaper to manufacture 
and pose less of an allergenic risk to 
 

the consumers.

However, the effect these microbeads 

have on the environment — especially on the 
Great Lakes — overrides their cost efficiency. 
Due to the tininess of these microplastics 
(microbeads found in cosmetic products tend 
to be less than one millimeter in diameter), 
it’s incredibly difficult to clean up the 
particles. Plastic microbeads absorb toxins 
from the environment and fish in the lakes 
confuse the microbeads for food; if consumed 
in high enough concentrations, these toxins 
— some of which are believed to cause cancer 
and reproductive problems — can make their 
way up the food chain, adversely affecting 
the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem as 
well as our own.

It is no wonder, then, why so many states 

have started to ban products containing 
microbeads. Since mid-2014 alone, nine 
states have passed laws outlawing the sale of 
products with microbeads, including Great 
Lakes neighbors Illinois, Wisconsin and 
Indiana. These laws vary in strictness. For 
example, Maryland bans only products that 
contain “synthetic plastic microbeads” that 
are nonbiodegradable, whereas California 
law entirely bans companies from selling or 
offering products with microbeads of any 
sort, exempting only products that contain 
“less than 1 part per million (ppm) by weight 
of plastic microbeads.”

The problem with the proposition now 

facing Michigan’s legislature is there is no 
qualification set forth for how long a plastic 
can exist in a marine environment before 
being decomposed by microorganisms into 
carbon dioxide and water to be considered 
biodegradable. This can be fixed if the 
term “nonbiodegradable” is based off the 
European Union’s definition, which says a 
product is biodegradable if it decomposes 
within 
six 
months. 
Furthermore, 
the 

government should then be able to revise 
these standards periodically to account for 
advances in technology and research. These 
provisions would give companies reasonable 
flexibility to develop effective products while 
keeping potential environmental harm in 
their consciences.

Fortunately, 
personal 
care 
product 

powerhouses such as L’Oreal, Johnson 
& Johnson and Procter & Gamble are 
currently working on phasing out the use of 
nonbiodegradable plastics in their products. 
These 
companies’ 
influence 
combined 

with government regulation would likely 
be effective in pressuring the industry as a 
whole toward a more eco-friendly mindset. 

It is also important to remember that 

microbeads contribute to just a small part 
of the pollution problem. According to Allen 
Burton, a professor at the University’s School 
of Natural Resources and Environment, 
the media and politicians have exaggerated 
microbeads as the leading problem in 
polluted marine and lake environments, 
when this is not the case. In addition to this 
legislation, Michigan’s legislature should 
immediately work toward reforms to control 
invasive species, soil erosion, habitat damage 
and chemical input that pose an even greater 
risk to the Great Lakes. 

negotiate and compromise. It’s about 
restoring efficacy and integrity to 
government by filling positions with 
professionals who understand that 
they are public servants, paid by 
taxpayers to run the government. 
How often do you see a group of 
employees threaten to shut down 
their own company in order to get 
their way — and not get fired?

The far right grows increasingly 

powerful 
only 
because 
their 

absurdity draws so much attention. 
To stay credible, the Republican 
Party needs to prevent future 
embarrassments like its ongoing 
inability to select a Speaker of the 

House, 
threatened 
government 

shutdowns and 10-plus candidate 
presidential primaries replete with 
racial hatred and tax code burning.

To do this, the GOP needs to confront 

its most ridiculous members where 
they have the greatest advantage — in 
the media. The GOP needs to garner 
attention based on the positive actions 
of its members. The Republicans need 
to propose meaningful solutions and 
discredit the more extreme members 
of their own party, irrespective of the 
angry responses they’re likely to get in 
return.

The Republican Party has created 

an environment where its own 

name is associated with policies 
that most of its members don’t 
support. It’s allowed social issues to 
dominate at the expense of issues 
that the party is uniquely equipped 
to address: advancing U.S. foreign 
policy interests, restoring balance 
to the budget, making government 
operations more efficient and the tax

The far right has received its

The world of high 
fashion adopts the 

sneaker 

By MARIAM SHEIKH

Daily Style Editor

A few words and images 

immediately come to mind 
when I hear the word “sneak-
ers.” Athletes, sports, working 
out — basically anything that 
has to do with being physically 
inclined or fit. What doesn’t 
come to mind is fashion, run-
ways, models, celebrities. But 
that’s the surprising thing — 
recently, the world of high fash-
ion pulled an Angelina Jolie 
and adopted the sneaker. Gain-
ing traction in 2014 with the 
emergence of the classic white 
sneaker on major runways, 
coupled with everyday not-so-
active active-wear, the sneaker 
trend is still in full force as we 
near the end of 2015. Some 
argue that it’s getting out of 
hand — but is it really?

Kickin’ it old school: Fashion 

always finds ways to recycle 
itself. What’s trending is direct-
ly pulled from different aspects 
of culture, street style, Kylie 
Jenner’s Instagram and so on. 
One year a design is on the run-
way, the next it’s marked down 
for the rest of the world to wear 
the shit out of it. Sneakers are 
the perfect example of this. Oh, 
sneakers. As someone who has 
never been naturally athletic, 
sneakers have always been the 
shoes I wear when I’m doing 
something that is truly physi-
cally demanding, like helping 
my mother bring the grocer-
ies in or when I embark on my 
once-a-year trip to the CCRB.

I remember the history of 

them all. Starting with my very 
first pair of light-up Skechers 
from way back in the day, I soon 
graduated to my mandatory 
Catholic school gym uniform 
white sneaks (they were even 
less cool than it sounds). But 
don’t worry guys, my parents 
decided to take me shopping for 
a weekend pair of slip-on DKNY 
sneakers (needless to say those 
were only for those hot summer 
days). Fast-forward to today, 
a #blessed world where I no 
longer have a school uniform, 
light-up shoes are out of style 
and my parents have stopped 
picking out my clothing. Fast-
forward to today where any-
one on the University’s campus 
can be found in a classic pair of 
sneakers. Black and gray, roshe 
flyknit, with that unforgiveable 
Nike “swoosh,” I’m officially 
a conformist. But I have no 
regrets and here’s why:

The comfort factor: While my 

history with sneakers is both 
worrisome and complicated, 
there’s no denying their prac-
ticality. When running around 
Downtown Ann Arbor doing a 
variety of random shit, it’s nice 
to have a shoe that is not only 
wearable for every season, but 
one that is also comfortable no 
matter what. The comfort fac-
tor extends beyond physicality. 
Sneakers have become, for me, 

an accessory that makes me 
comfortable in my own skin. I 
know that for whatever outfit I 
have on, a pair of sneakers will 
go a long way no matter what.

From a non-athletic girl, to 

the rest of the world: This is 
what I like to call the “I’m down 
to earth and low-key athletic 
factor.” A pair of shoes, espe-
cially customizable sneakers, 
is something that reflects you. 
Some people think the eyes are 
the windows to the soul. First 
off, that’s definitely something 
a hippie just made up. And sec-
ond, think what you want, but 
a pair of sneakers can tell you 
a lot about a person as well. 
Sneakers will customize any 
outfit and add your own unique 
style. They can say a lot about 
your identity in that moment, 
for that day. Are you trendy, 
athletic, strong, a hot-mess, 
allergic to nature, or do you just 
radiate an air of hipster-esque 
vibes? The list goes on. People 
equate “starting over” to mov-
ing away and making new 
friends. I equate a change in 
identity with a simple change 
in your sneakers.

In the end there’s nothing 

like putting an athletic touch 
on an outfit that has nothing to 
do with athleticism (guilty).

The options are endless (lit-

erally): It’s amazing that we 
live in a society where I can 
customize my own sneakers 
right down to the pattern on 
the sole of the shoe and have 
them delivered to my doorstep 
within a few days. From colors, 
to texture, from design, to type 
— it’s overwhelming. Bright-
colored sneaks are the shoe of 
the moment for everyday wear. 
Matching shoes to one’s outfit 
is out, and making a statement 
by what you wear on your feet is 
in. Apart from average humans, 
like us college students who are 
almost always dressed casually, 
there are those with cause to 
dress fancier. Models, celebri-
ties, influencers of all types, 
are starting to pair sneakers 
with formal wear. Gigi Hadid 
is often photographed wear-
ing the same pair of classic 
white Adidas sneakers on vari-
ous occasions, from running 
errands to going clubbing. Ball 
gowns, suits, tuxedos — a pair 
of quality sneakers can go a 
long way.

But of course, with so many 

options, there’s room for chaos 
to ensue, and this chaos comes 
in the form of hideous designs 
and lack of consideration for 
the masses — the spawn of over-
zealous designers. The most 
hideous byproduct that comes 
to mind is the wedge sneaker. A 
shoe that is an entity of its own 
should not be fused with some-
thing else, least of all a wedge. 
Another — while they are sleek 
and beautiful in design — the 
$20,000 eBay price tag on a 
pair of Adidas Yeezys is enough 
to make Donald Trump cringe. 
Listen to the kids, Kanye.

The world of fashion — and 

style itself — is cyclical. Just 
a few years ago I thought I 
would never be caught dead 
in anything suede, fringed or 
entirely made of jean, and yet 
that is exactly what’s trending. 
There’s something liberating 
and almost comical about it, 
really. In regards to the shoe 
of the year, there’s a refresh-
ing touch about something as 
simple as a pair of ripped blue 
jeans and some fresh-to-death 
sneakers. 

No end of 
options for 
cool sneaks

Some argue 

that the sneaker 
trend is getting 

out of hand.

My history with 
sneakers is both 
worrisome and 

complicated.

Fashion always 
finds ways to 
recycle itself.

SMTD brings Green 
Day to Mendelssohn

By MICHAEL FLYNN

Daily Arts Writer

Since the ’60s, rock music 

has served the dual purposes 
of both communicating socio-
political 
messag-
es, 
as 

well 
as 

provid-
ing ener-
getic, 
joyous 
enter-
tain-
ment. 
While 
most modern bands have aban-
doned that tradition, Bay Area 
punk rockers Green Day have 
been a notable exception. Their 
2004 album American Idiot cap-
tured the paranoia and frustra-
tion of young people growing 
up in post-9/11 America, using 
a loose narrative and multi-part 
musical suites to create a 21st 
century rock opera.

After the success of the 

album, Green Day lead sing-
er Billie Joe Armstrong and 
“Spring 
Awakening” 
writer 

Michael Mayer collaborated in 
adapting American Idiot into a 
stage play, which premiered in 
2009 at the Berkeley Repertory 
Theatre in California to rave 
reviews, before moving on to 
a Broadway run in 2010. Now, 
the School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance is presenting the moving 
and lively play.

“It’s been a great labor of 

love from the beginning, from 
the audition process through 
rehearsals,” 
director 
Linda 

Goodrich said. “It’s a subject 
that’s relevant for the students, 
and it’s been a wonderful 
collaboration between faculty 
and students.”

Goodrich was inspired to 

direct the play after seeing it on 
Broadway.

“I was really shocked to 

know how much it did resonate 
with the students,” Goodrich 
said. “It’s written in the post-
9/11 era and was very much 
about the disillusionment of 
that time and the saturation of 
media (with) some people feel-
ing alienated and disempow-
ered. If anything, it’s even more 
so, as social media (contributes) 
to the saturation of media.”

The use of rock singing makes 

“American Idiot” unique from 
the other plays in the School 
of Music, Theatre & Dance’s 
schedule, but also presented 
a great challenge in trying to 
blend the loud rock music with 
clear vocals, to keep the music 
from distracting from the story.

“It’s just unusual to have a 

Green Day rock sound in the 
theater, for getting the balance 
of making it feel like a rock con-
cert and also keeping story firs; 
and we had a limited amount 

of time to tech that element,” 
Goodrich said. “In a profes-
sional setting, you would have 
a month of tech rehearsal, and 
in a school setting, because the-
ater, dance and opera are work-
ing in the same space, we have a 
very short window to get in the 
theater to actually get all of the 
technical elements happening.”

Students who grew up with 

the album American Idiot may 
wonder how the story has 
changed in its translation to 
the stage. They can rest assured 
that the story remains intact.

“They’re all from the con-

cept album,” Goodrich said of 
the songs featured in the show. 
“There are these letters that 
Johnny writes to his mother 
throughout the show, or to his 
friend Will, and those letters 
are the only interstitial dia-
logue in the show.”

While the plot of the story 

remains unchanged, seeing it 
onstage will make the plot clear-
er than it was on the record.

“It is in the album, but you’re 

kind of like a treasure hunter, 
finding those moments and 
what’s really in the poetry and 
what it’s saying,” Goodrich said. 
“Essentially it’s all there, but it 
becomes clearer as you put it on 
stage and give those character 
voices to individuals.”

Not only will the plot be 

clearer, but also the emotions 
conveyed through seeing actors 
perform the material onstage.

“We 
work 
for 
a 
certain 

amount of time to put a show up, 
and when an audience comes, 
that’s when the real commu-
nication 
happens,” 
Goodrich 

said. “We get to learn from the 
piece; the audience takes it in, 
and there’s that kind of synergy 
between actor and audience. It’s 
really magical, and when the 
idea’s actually communicated 
and taken in and responded to 
by an audience. Hopefully it’s 
more than entertainment — we 
really grapple with these issues 
together and go away from the 
theater and are changed by it.”

The show also boasts a style 

of dance that is looser and more 
unrestrained than what one 
would normally see in a musical.

“Visually, 
there’s 
almost 

a 
modern 
dance 
element,” 

Goodrich said. “The dance is 
not only telling the information 
of the story but also uses dance 
and movement in a way that cap-
tures the emotion of the music. 
Most of the original company 
weren’t dancers. It’s so interest-
ing to see a raw mover express 
themselves 
choreographical-

ly. It’s different from seeing a 
trained dancer.”

With this in mind, Goodrich 

urges students to come see the 
show, enjoy the visual additions 
to the album’s story and bask 
in the community element of 
watching a live performance.

“It makes the storytelling so 

clear, to actually see the story 
and all of the richness of the 
poetry, it really comes to life 
in the stage play. And just the 
community of coming out and 
experiencing it together, and 
addressing it as a community. It 
promises great fun and enjoy-
ment and thought and it’s going 
to hit you on many levels.”

TV REVIEW

Easy-going, quirky 
premiere for ‘Casual’

By DANIELLE YACOBSON

For The Daily

In an easy-going and quirky 

premiere, 
Hulu’s 
new 
origi-

nal comedy, “Casual,” strikes a 
unique balance between unfil-

tered social commentary and a 
mellow, indie mood. As divorcee 
Valerie (Michaela Watkins “New 
Girl”) 
and 

her daughter 
Lauren (Tara 
Lynne Barr, 
“God 
Bless 

America”) 
move in with 
Valerie’s 
directionless 
brother Alex 
(Tommy 
Dewey “The 
Mindy Proj-
ect”), the trio half-heartedly 
takes on dating with warm 
humor and genuine acting. The 
pilot successfully sets up a prem-
ise with the potential to lead 
the characters in a multitude of 
directions as they tackle their 
personal lives in an unconven-
tional setting.

During a nasty divorce, Valeria 

and her daughter move in with 
Alex, who takes it upon himself 
to push Valerie back into the dat-
ing scene. The two singles tackle 
casual dating while Lauren, a ram-
bunctious teen, explores her own 
romantic life under the same roof.

Particularly refreshing is the 

pilot’s ability to bring comedy into 
serious and often taboo issues. 
The episode opens with a funeral 
scene, with the three leads passing 
unfiltered judgment on mourn-
ing family members. Commenting 
that the body in the casket looks 
low on embalming fluid, the char-
acters reveal that the ceremony is 
held for none other than Valerie 
and Alex’s father. Turns out, the 
funeral was all a dream, but even 
in reality, this family has serious 
problems. The witty and mildly 
inappropriate remarks continue 
as themes of divorce and depres-
sion take form in the first episode, 
setting up darker tones to echo 
throughout the season. While 
the pilot wasn’t driven by plot or 
storylines, the characters’ candid 
honesty on life and love will be the 
reason “Casual” is worth sticking 
around for.

In particular, the comedy’s 

no-filter approach to sex offers 
a fresh perspective on today’s 
increasingly popular online dat-
ing scene. Alex creates a Tinder-
esque platform called Snooger, 
even though he openly despis-
es the superficiality of online 
dating. 
Unmerciful 
judgment 

ensues, making it easy to identify 

with the characters and their all-
too-common dating mishaps.

While the pilot didn’t have a 

clear direction in narrative, the 
story hinged upon the genuine 
relationships of the three leads. 
Undeniably close, brother-sister 
duo Alex and Valerie are what 
every sibling pair secretly wishes 
they could be. Blind dates at the 
same restaurant might be cross-
ing the line for some, but these 
two need their best friend hid-
ing out in the bathroom to gossip 
about the dates from hell. Alex’s 
unapologetically cynical view on 
love complements Valerie’s deli-
cate confidence after her divorce, 
setting up a relatable and come-
dic outlet for the two to take 
on their single lives one casual 
hookup at a time.

Now, add a sexually active teen-

ager to the mix. Sporting a Pola-
roid logo T-shirt and lounging in 
a bedroom strung with Christmas 
lights and clothes-pinned pic-
tures, Lauren’s version of casual 
is somewhat unexpected. On 
the pill since age 12, she clearly 
doesn’t shy away from public dis-
plays of affection and, without 
any parental backlash, the teen 
does whatever she pleases. The 
mother-daughter relationship is 
somewhat à la “Freaky Friday,” 
as therapist mother struggles to 
reign in her free-spirited daugh-
ter. Lauren adds an exciting 
energy to the otherwise subdued 
humor of the pilot, propelling the 
storyline to move forward with a 
connection to older and younger 
audiences alike.

All living under the same roof, 

Valerie, Alex and Lauren have a 
natural chemistry that is beauti-
fully captured by the cinematog-
raphy. The muted tones and tilted 
angles give the episode an indie 
vibe, scored with mellow string 
music in the background. Close-
up shots that highlight the subtle 
nuances in facial expressions and 
body language add an intimate 
feel to the comedy and make it 
easy to connect to the characters 
from the opening scene. 

While it won’t keep you on the 

edge of your seat, “Casual” has an 
easiness to it that is often under-
valued in TV. It’s witty, with dark-
er underlying themes that make it 
more personal than a raunchy sit-
com. In a modern and offbeat fam-
ily setting, this light comedy will 
remind the audience to not take 
themselves or life too seriously. 

FILM REVIEW
‘Pan’ is beautiful 
cinema sans soul

By NOAH COHEN

Daily Arts Writer

“Pan” commits no cardinal 

sins. It never breaks its contract 
with the audience. It does some-
thing 
worse 

than betray us: 
it fails to make 
us feel stuff.

 One night 

during 
World 

War II, inex-
plicably 
evil 

English 
nuns 

sell 
orphans 

to magic pirates who take said 
orphans to Neverland where Black-
beard (Hugh Jackman, “X-Men”) 
forces them to mine pixie dust to 
help him maintain his eternal life. 
Hook (Garrett Hedlund, “Friday 
Night Lights”) is a fellow miner 
here, and Peter (Levi Miller, in 
his first feature film), revealing 
that he can fly and is therefore the 
“Chosen One,” escapes the mines 
with Hook’s help. Peter seeks his 
mother and the lost Fairy City in a 
bumbling quest to simultaneously 
protect the fairies, discover who 
he is, believe in himself and find 
his long-lost mother. The party 
soon finds one more member, 
Princess Tiger Lily (Rooney Mara, 
“The Girl with the Dragon Tat-
too”) among the natives of Never-
land. She, our ass-kicking beauty, 
exposits on Peter’s plot armor and 
tops off the movie’s ambient sense 
of urgency, but it’s too little too 
late. We don’t care for this Never-
land, we don’t care for Peter and, 
as Mr. Smee (Adeel Akhtar, “Four 
Lions”) exclaims in an ironic 
moment of clarity, “nobody cares 
about (Peter’s) mother!”

 The joy of the Peter Pan story 

hinges on the wonder of a Never-
land that floats about with child-
ish naiveté. Director Joe Wright’s 
(“Atonement”) Neverland is fan-
tastical only as an excuse to cut 
corners on world-building. The 
wholesomeness of its stunning 
visuals is so overtaxed with unin-
spired dramatic nonsense that 
the audience yearns for an out, for 
something mad or ugly to shake us 
out of our stupor. There’s no out. 

There’s no plot twist. The plot is 
marched forward like an invalid 
in a wheelbarrow by some cosmic 
wind of inevitability. There’s no 
emotional initiative and only the 
barest of sequential logic.

 A magical universe like that of 

“Pan” depends on narrative logic to 
constrain its spontaneity. Without 
a sense of context and limitation, 
the existence of magic is boringly 
storybreaking. Why worry about 
the vicious crocodiles in the river 
if your ship can fly through the air? 
If the fairies are so powerful, why 
do they need the help of a 12-year-
old boy at all? Too many questions 
in “Pan” can be answered only by 
“magic.” Magic quickly becomes a 
narrative beast-of-burden, and for 
every element of heavy-lifting that 
magic does for the story, it robs 
the story’s emotional logic of an 
opportunity to lure the audience 
into its groove.

 Jackman does wonderfully, ful-

filling expectation. A Neverland 
villain must be evil and ridiculous 
in equal measure, and Jackman 
wrangles this formula with car-
toonish intensity. If the whole 
movie had committed to Jack-
man’s silliness, it would have hit a 
higher mark.

 In his opening scene, Jack-

man conducts the orphan slaves 
of Neverland in a roaring rendi-

tion of Nirvana’s “Smells Like 
Teen Spirit”, and the weirdness 
of this directorial choice is imme-
diately smoothed over by the 
deliberate oddity of Jackman’s 
persona. Hedlund uses a more 
devil-may-care formula for (soon-
to-be-Captain) Hook’s swagger. 
Hedlund is less weird and inter-
esting than Jackman, but passably 
successful. The rest of the for-
mulaic cut-outs are questionable 
at best. Blackbeard’s meathead 
minion is a beefy black guy; Smee, 
the take-what-he-can-get traitor, 
is strongly coded as Jewish; Nev-
erland’s native Kung-Fu master 
is a stringy Asian guy, and Mara’s 
native princess, though shiningly 
acted, is as pale as the freshly-
driven snow. Warner Bros casted 
this movie to fit a mold, and we 
would rather have seen that mold 
broken into a million pieces.

 For all the molds “Pan” fills, 

it fails to fill the only hollow that 
really matters, its raison d’être. 
We eschew Aesop Fable movies for 
taking the easy choice, railroad-
ing a fantasy’s moral universe, but 
children’s tales need dense moral 
substance or they drift apart at the 
seams. “Pan” floats on from start 
to finish, unwilling or unable to 
choose a convincing core value, 
and there’s no wind in its sails to 
pull it back to course.

WARNER BROS.

Don’t come near him with a lighter.

songs in a shit-
ty bar that’s 
addicting to the ears.

With solid record sales and 

growing popularity, the band 
released a third album on Oct. 9, 
The Agent Intellect. If you could 
imagine a cross breed between 
Joy Division and Cloud Nothings, 
that’s what it sounds like.

No Passion All Technique, Pro-

tomartyr’s debut record, sounded 
more rock ‘n’ roll than post punk. 
Released by Urinal Cake Records, 
No Passion’s guitar resembled 
music found in the ’70s rather than 
modern times. The band switched 
record labels and has been under 
Hardly Art ever since releasing 
their album Under Color of Offi-
cial Right. Each song under Urinal 
Cake held a calming-but-positive 
vibe that differs from the mellow-
but-depressing vibe you get from 
other works under Hardly Art.

In The Agent Intellect, singer 

Joe Casey has a voice that resem-
bles moaning dialogues instead of 
actual singing, haunting the listen-
er with each syllable. Casey holds 
a monotone voice throughout the 
album that reflects the feeling of 
giving up. In “Pontiac 87,” Casey 
states, “There’s no use in being sad 
about it/ What’s the point of crying 
about it?” to emphasize his pas-
sive tone in the songs and his most 
likely passive attitude towards life.

Similarly to Protomartyr’s pre-

vious albums, religious and philo-
sophical undertones are present 
in The Agent Intellect. The song 
“Feast of Stephen,” was inspired 
by the celebration of St. Stephen 
who was the first christian martyr 
(or “Protomartyr”). Coincidence? 
I think not. They also have a song 
named “Boyce or Boice,” which is 
the name of a demon that disrupts 
any electronic technology. But 
what is odd about Protomartyr is 
that the references aren’t meta-
phors to anything emotional or 
spiritual; they are quite literal.

In “Boyce and Boice” there are 

lyrics that simply state, “Electron-
ic malfunction/ The strange opin-
ions from foreign lands,” and then 
it continues with words that I can’t 
make out and that don’t make any 
sense. Maybe I just don’t get the 
deep meaning to this song because 
I have never had an encounter with 
demons that mess up my computer, 
or maybe that deep meaning sim-
ply doesn’t exist. I guess it’s up to 

the listener, which is what music is 
supposed to be about. Pure inter-
pretation.

Despite the weird lyrics and 

monotone vocals, guitarist Greg 
Ahee pulls together each song 
to create a gorgeous flow in the 
album. He hits the strings in all of 
the right places to keep the listen-
er’s interest with each song hold-
ing different components.

The first single from the album, 

“Why Does It Shake,” displays the 
disoriented feeling in their songs. 
It starts out as a slow head-banger 
when Casey states “False happi-
ness is on the rise/ See the victims 
pile high,” building up to a hard-
core sounding thrasher when he 
says “I’m never gonna lose it.” 
The build up releases and the song 
ends with this hypnotic sounding 
chant of “Why does it shake/ The 
body the body/ Why does it move/ 
The fear the fear.” The mood of 
this song and others in The Agent 
Intellect have that wonderful con-
trast in sounds making it a perfect 
album to listen to when you’re lay-
ing in your room, staring at the 
ceiling, thinking about life.

Although The Agent Intellect 

lacks the interesting lyrics present 
in Protomartyr’s first two albums, 
it contains dreamy instrumentals 
that still tug on your heart strings. 
Let’s hope the band releases more 
chill jams and doesn’t follow their 
lyrical chant at the end of “Cow-
ards Starve,” by “going out in style” 
with this album.

Beilein gives injury updates

By JACOB GASE

Daily Sports Editor

ROSEMONT, Ill. — When 

Michigan coach John Beilein 
arrived at the Chicago Marriott 
O’Hare for Big Ten Basketball 
Media Day, he picked up right on 
the same grim note he left off on 
last season: Answering questions 
about his players’ freak injuries.

Senior guard Caris LeVert and 

junior guard Derrick Walton Jr. 
are finally back to full strength, 
Beilein said two weeks ago, but the 
same still can’t be said for junior 
forward Zak Irvin (back) and 
senior guard Spike Albrecht (hips), 
both of whom are recovering from 
offseason surgeries.

Irvin had been suffering from 

“a few aches and pains” late in the 
summer before his back suddenly 
flared up in an open gym session, 
forcing him to undergo an MRI 
and ultimately go under the knife 
to correct the problem. Beilein 
declined to provide a medical 
term for Irvin’s injury, but he 
believes his starting forward will 
be ready to go soon.

“We’re still on schedule for the 

beginning of the season,” Beilein 
said. “Hopefully in November, 
he will be back playing — that’s 
our hope. He’s going to begin 
(conditioning) this week. We have 
all the underwater treadmills 
and the different things, that (he 
is still) conditioning. Basketball-
wise, he’s shooting foul shots now.”

Albrecht is much farther along 

on the road to recovery, but he 
still has been frequently spelled 
by junior Andrew Dakich to get 
extra rest during practice.

“He’s progressing,” Beilein said. 

“I feel somewhere near the start of 
the season, he’ll be at 100 percent, 
but he’s not as limited as Zak is 
right now. He was absolutely shut 
down from April (to) August. He’s 
shooting the ball really well, and 
he’s seeing the floor really well, but 
right now, defense, ball-handling, 
all those things — (he’s) still trying 

to catch up.”

NEW RULES: One of the major 

challenges facing every college 
basketball coach this season is the 
NCAA’s recent rule changes, which 
include a 30-second shot clock and 
a rule that players, not coaches, 
must call live-ball timeouts.

The Big Ten coaches expressed 

varying opinions on the NCAA’s 
decision.

“I’m not sure I love the 

no-timeout deal,” said Nebraska 
coach Tim Miles. “There’s some of 
the timeout stuff I like, but at the 
same time, the no live-ball thing — 
it’s kind of our livelihood, so I think 
I’d prefer to have that control.”

Michigan State coach Tom Izzo 

disagreed.

“If it were up to me, if I was the 

Czar for the day, I’d try to get every 
rule like the NBA, personally,” he 
said. “I just think that we’d have 
a better working relationship. It 
would make sense to me.”

Beilein, citing the fact that 

the live-ball timeout rules have 
changed on other occasions over 
the course of his career, seemed 
indifferent to the new rule.

“It’s not a big adjustment,” 

Beilein said. “The players are 
going to look at (me), I’m gonna 
say, ‘Call timeout,’ and they’re 
gonna call timeout.”

RYAN’S FINAL SEASON: 

Apart from the rule changes, 
Wisconsin 
coach 
Bo 
Ryan’s 

impending 
retirement 
was 

another hot topic among the 
coaches gathered in Rosemont. 
Some, 
like 
Maryland’s 
Mark 

Turgeon, were skeptical that the 
legendary coach would actually 
hang it up following the season. 
Others 
sounded 
practically 

excited to see him go.

“I was very hopeful that he’d 

make that announcement,” Beilein 
joked. “If you look at our record 
against him, I was very hopeful.”

He may be glad to be rid of 

Ryan, but Beilein had no shortage 
of praise for the Badgers’ coach.

“He’s just a tremendous coach,” 

Beilein said, “But what I love is 
that he’s done it at the other levels 
that a lot of coaches don’t know 
about, and I know about. Those 
championships in Division III are 
so hard to do, and he wins those. 

And 
then 
Wisconsin 
doesn’t 

know what it’s like not to go to the 
NCAA Tournament.”

RIVALRY WEEK: The Big 

Ten coaches may have come 
to Chicago to talk basketball, 
but the events surrounding the 
Michigan-Michigan State football 
matchup this weekend had Tom 
Izzo’s mind wandering elsewhere.

A year after the Diag’s block 

‘M’ was painted green, the statue 
of Magic Johnson on Michigan 
State’s campus was discovered 
Thursday morning bearing a 
block ‘M’ and ‘BEAT STATE’ in 
maize spraypaint.

“First, I’ve gotta say that this 

is rivalry week, and you’re not 
supposed to like your opponent,” 
Izzo said. “There’s a lot of great 
Michigan kids, but there’s some 
idiots. There’s some idiots on our 
side, too, that do crazy things. 
Messing with Sparty is a bad 
thing, like messing with their ‘M’ 
is a bad thing. But messing with 
Magic, that’s the worst thing. 
I’ll make sure that, from now on, 
maybe the basketball team will 
sleep (out there).”

Senior guard Spike Albrecht is progressing after offseason hip surgery and should be ready for the start of the season.

‘M’ squanders late 
lead at Wisconsin

Wolverines give up 
three late goals in 
Big Ten road game

By THERESA ROSS

For the Daily

The Wisconsin women’s soccer 

team came back from a two-
goal deficit against Michigan on 
Thursday 
night 
in 

Madison, 
scoring three 
goals in the last 30 minutes for a 
3-2 win.

The Wolverines (5-2 Big Ten, 

10-5 overall) and Badgers went 
into the game tied for second in 
the Big Ten. After a last-second 
Michigan win in the match a year 
ago, Wisconsin was eager for 
revenge.

With the majority of the 

posession split between the two 
teams, Michigan put its focus 
toward 
offense, 
outshooting 

Wisconsin, 15-9.

“The few chances they got, 

they put in the back of the net, 
and I think that was really the 
difference of the game,” said 
Michigan coach Greg Ryan.

The 
Wolverines 
lost 

momentum in the second half 
after the Badgers scored their 
first goal in the 66th minute, 
when 
midfielder 
McKenna 

Meuer scored on a corner kick by 
midfielder Micaela Powers.

In the last 10 minutes of the 

game, Wisconsin (6-1, 9-4) both 
equalized the score and took 
the lead. With 10:54 to go in 
the match, midfielder Kinley 
McNicoll answered a cross from 
forward Sydney McGinnis, which 
was followed by a goal just two 
minutes later from forward Nikki 

Greenhalgh straight into the back 
corner past Michigan sophomore 
goalie Megan Hinz.

The Wolverines allowed the 

Badgers a comeback after failing 
to capitalize on on opportunities 
in the second half. With six 
more shots than the Badgers, the 
Wolverines were left with many 
near-goal opportunities.

“I 
honestly 
thought 
we 

dominated the second half and 
had multiple chances for goals 
number three, four and five,” 
Ryan said.

Following 
a 
hat 
trick 
in 

Michigan’s 3-1 win over Illinois 
on Oct. 11, redshirt sophomore 
forward Ani Sarkisian scored 
the first goal of the game at 
the 25-minute mark. Sarkisian 
dribbled past five defenders and 
finished a shot just inside the 
18-yard box, sliding the ball past 
Wisconsin goalie Caitlyn Clem.

The Wolverines ended the first 

half with a 1-0 lead, outshooting 
the Badgers, 3-1. The Badgers’ 
first shot on goal was a header 
from midfielder Victoria Pickett 
that was called off based on a foul. 

Michigan 
junior 
midfielder 

Jessica Heifetz took advantage 
of a loose ball in the box after a 
corner kick, giving the Wolverines 
a 2-0 lead. With an assist from 
senior 
midfielder 
Christina 

Murillo, Heifetz was in the right 
place at the right time. 

The 
Wolverines 
face 

Minnesota on Sunday, followed 
by Purdue and Penn State. With 
the Big Ten Tournament starting 
Nov. 
1, 
the 
Wolverines 
are 

looking forward to games against 
competitive conference foes.

“I told the team tonight if we 

play as well as we did today, we’re 
gonna win the most of the rest of 
the games,” Ryan said. “I think the 
key is getting ready for Sunday.”

Rivalry week is back, and at this point of the season, it couldn’t 
be bigger. College GameDay comes to town for Saturday’s 
matchup between No. 12 Michigan and No. 7 Michigan State. 
The Spartans have dominated the past two matchups, but the 
Wolverines are rolling into this year’s battle for the Paul Bunyan 
Trophy. Winner gets the inside track to the Big Ten East title.

Michigan can take another big step by 
winning back the rivalry series.

Utah (Sept. 3): Well, at least the mountains 
were cool?

Oregon State (Sept. 12): Imagine how Jim 
Harbaugh would have freaked out if Michigan 
lost.

Michigan State (Oct. 17): These teams play a 
week earlier than last year, which Mark Danto-
nio will take as a sign of blatant disrespect.

Minnesota (Oct. 31): Plot twist: Michigan plays 
Minnesota for the Little Orange Pumpkin.

Rutgers (Nov. 7): Will Michigan fans storm the 
field if the Wolverines avenge last year’s loss in 
Piscataway? We hope not.

UNLV (Sept. 19): More like Loss Vegas.

Indiana (Nov. 14): Boring state. Hopefully not a 
boring game.

BYU (Sept. 26): The Mormons left Ann Arbor 
with more wives than points.

Maryland (Oct. 3): The Terrapins turtled at 
Michigan’s stingy defense.

Northwestern (Oct. 10): M380N.
Ohio State (Nov. 28): We wanted to make a 
joke, but the only one we could think of was, 
“Haha, your backup QB might win the Heisman.”

Penn State (Nov. 21): Christian Hackenberg 
could be a first-round pi — aaand, he just got 
sacked again.

Breakdown: ‘M’ vs. Michigan State

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

The Michigan football team’s 

first rivalry week is here, and the 
Wolverines are in a position few 
thought they would be in before 
the season.

No. 7 Michigan State (2-0 Big 

Ten, 6-0 overall) comes to town 
Saturday in a four-way tie for the 
Big Ten East and contending for a 
spot in the College Football Playoff. 
But the real surprise has been 
Michigan (2-0 Big Ten, 5-1 overall), 
which is also tied for first in the 
division and enters this weekend’s 
game as a 7.5-point favorite.

Yes, much has changed since the 

Spartans rolled the Wolverines, 
35-11, last season. Michigan coach 
Jim Harbaugh has turned his 
team around, and in many fans’ 
minds, last season’s game is a 
distant memory. The Wolverines 
can put it even further in the rear-
view mirror with a win Saturday.

Here’s how the teams stack up:

Michigan 
pass 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan State pass defense

Michigan hasn’t needed to 

worry about its pass offense much 
lately, leading comfortably in each 
of its past five games. Perhaps 
that’s part of the reason that the 
Wolverines rank 97th nationally 
in passing offense with 189.2 yards 
per game — they have spent most 
of their fourth quarters milking 
the clock.

This Saturday could be different 

(though the same appeared to 
be true when Brigham Young 
and Northwestern visited the 
Big House). The Spartans are 
Michigan’s third ranked opponent 
in four weeks, and they are also 
ranked the highest of the three.

But their secondary also isn’t 

what it has been in the past. The 
Spartans, who lost safety Kurtis 
Drummond and cornerback Trae 
Waynes from last year’s unit, 
are allowing 242 passing yards 
per game (88th in the country) 
and struggle to get off the field 
on third downs. Last week, they 
allowed Rutgers’ Leonte Carroo 
to catch seven passes for 134 yards 
and three touchdowns.

In 
recent 
years, 
Michigan 

State’s pass defense has locked 
down Michigan’s wide receivers, 
and the Wolverines have lacked 
a home-run component in their 
passing game so far. But even a 
big play or two could change the 

nature of the game Saturday.

Edge: Michigan State

Michigan 
rush 
offense 
vs. 

Michigan State rush defense

The 
Spartans’ 
front 
seven 

has stifled Michigan’s running 
game the past two years, but this 
season, the Wolverines might 
have a remedy: junior running 
back De’Veon Smith. Smith has 
390 yards in just five games — he 
missed the Maryland contest with 
an ankle injury — and has shown 
the power ability Michigan has 
sought in the past. Redshirt junior 
running back Drake Johnson has 
played a supporting role, as have 
the Wolverines’ blocking fullbacks 
and tight ends.

The question Saturday will 

be whether that ability holds up 
against a Michigan State front 
led by fifth-year senior defensive 
end Shilique Calhoun. Behind 
Calhoun, middle linebacker Riley 
Bullough leads the team with 55 
tackles to go with three sacks.

Former defensive coordinator 

Pat Narduzzi is gone, and the 
Spartans’ defense doesn’t quite 
have the same teeth this year, 
ranking 34th against the run. 
But with four seniors in the 
front seven, they have plenty 
of firepower to give Michigan 
problems.

Edge: Michigan State

Michigan State pass offense vs. 
Michigan pass defense

Michigan State’s key to the 

Paul 
Bunyan 
Trophy 
doesn’t 

usually include an aerial attack, 
but the Spartans don’t usually 
have a quarterback like Connor 
Cook. 
Their 
fifth-year 
senior 

quarterback is completing 60 
percent of his passes for 1,344 
yards, 12 touchdowns and two 
interceptions. And he’s 2-0 as a 
starter against Michigan, too.

Cook throws to an experienced 

receiving corps, including senior 
Aaron 
Burbridge 
(570 
yards, 

four touchdowns). The bigger 
issue might be protecting Cook, 
though. Two of Michigan State’s 
starting offensive linemen — left 
tackle Jack Conklin and center 
Jack Allen — are questionable 
for Saturday’s game, though the 
Wolverines are preparing as if 
they will play. If one or both of 
them can’t go, stopping Michigan’s 
fierce defensive line becomes that 
much tougher.

Across the line of scrimmage, 

the 
Wolverines’ 
pass 
rush 

is 
rolling. 
Michigan 
sacked 

Northwestern four times last 
week and has made life miserable 
for opposing quarterbacks in five 
straight games. Despite losing 
sophomore 
defensive 
tackle 

Bryan Mone to injury before the 
season and senior defensive end 
Mario Ojemudia to injury against 
Maryland, the Wolverines haven’t 

missed a beat.

Their secondary doesn’t make 

life easy on opponents, either, 
ranking second in the nation in 
pass defense. Junior cornerback 
Jourdan Lewis stripped the ball 
away from a receiver last week 
en route to a 37-yard pick-six, 
and junior cornerback Channing 
Stribling should return from an 
injury opposite Lewis this week.

Edge: Michigan

Michigan State rush offense vs. 
Michigan rush defense

The 
Spartans 
haven’t 
yet 

established a feature back in their 
offense, instead splitting carries 
between running backs LJ Scott 
and 
Madre 
London. 
London 

injured his foot in the third 
quarter against Rutgers, and his 
status is also unknown. Between 
Scott, London and Gerald Holmes, 
Michigan State’s rushing attack 
ranks 67th in the country.

Michigan, meanwhile, is just 

as stingy against the run as 
the pass. The Wolverines are 
allowing just 65.8 yards per game 
on the ground (third nationally), 
stopping even talented running 
backs such as Northwestern’s 
Justin Jackson. Their front is also 
a big reason for the defense’s No. 1 
third-down defense. If Michigan 
can limit the opposition on first 
and second down, it creates 
difficult 3rd-and-long situations, 

when the secondary does its best 
work and the blitz schemes create 
pressure.

Much of the battle in the 

trenches depends on the health 
of Michigan State’s offensive line. 
The Wolverines, too, are short-
handed: They will play the first 
half without senior linebacker 
James Ross, who was ejected for 
targeting in the third quarter last 
week. Senior linebacker Allen 
Gant is listed behind Ross on 
the depth chart, so he could play 
until halftime, with fellow senior 
linebacker Royce Jenkins-Stone 
already filling in for Ojemudia on 
the other side of the field.

Edge: Michigan

Special teams

Michigan 
special 
teams 

coordinator 
John 
Baxter’s 

methods are beginning to pay off. 
The most explosive result came on 
last week’s opening kickoff, when 
redshirt junior wide receiver Jehu 
Chesson returned the kick 96 
yards for a touchdown.

But the dividends have come 

in other areas, too. Senior kicker 
Kenny Allen is now 7-for-9 on field 
goals and has also been good on 
kickoffs. Meanwhile, Michigan 
State’s Michael Geiger is just 
5-for-9 on field goals.

Edge: Michigan

Intangibles

Both 
teams 
have 
avoided 

giving the other any bulletin-
board material all week, knowing 
the energy it could incite on the 
other side of the rivalry. The 
vandalism of the Magic Johnson 
statue in East Lansing will rile up 
the Spartans a bit, and Michigan 
heads into the game as the favorite 
despite being far outmatched in 
the last two meetings.

The Wolverines could find a 

reason for a chip on their shoulder, 
too: They have been outclassed for 
two straight years and have the 
pieces to do something about it this 
season. And the game is back in 
Ann Arbor after two years in East 
Lansing, so Michigan Stadium 
should provide a noticeable home-
field advantage.

Edge: Michigan

Pick: Michigan 21, Michigan 
State 19

Jim Brandstatter, Dan 

Dierdorf carry on 

Michigan radio tradition

By ZACH SHAW

Daily Sports Editor

Dan Dierdorf, a man who had been paid to talk 

about football for three decades and had trekked 
hundreds of miles for Michigan’s 2014 opening bout 
with Appalachian State, was speechless — frozen in 
the moment.

Below him, the band took the field, formed into its 

usual ‘M’ shape and rang in the 2014 season. The late-
summer sun glistened off the musicians’ instruments 
during the welcoming fanfare of the Michigan 
Marching Band. With a slate as clean as the cloudless 
sky above and a new Michigan football season kicking 
off in mere minutes, it wasn’t long before the entire 
stadium burst with joy.

It was a typical ritual, but Dierdorf was locked in — 

and silent.

Behind him, Jim Brandstatter was taken aback. 

Brandstatter was doing last-minute preparations for 
his debut as the play-by-play voice of Michigan football. 
The new era of Michigan football broadcasting was 
beginning, and his partner, Dierdorf, was fixated on 
the festivities below.

Surprising? Yes. Worrisome? Not to Brandstatter.
“He didn’t say a word, just took it all in — he was 

enraptured,” Brandstatter said. “To watch him really 
swallow and take in that entire moment and that event, 
to me, was great fun, and I was so happy for him that 
he had that moment. And I got to watch him fall in love 
with Michigan.”

To Brandstatter, that moment was, in a way, 

Dierdorf’s initiation. The newcomer had all the 
qualifications to be a color commentator: former 
Michigan player, former NFL player, Hall of Famer at 
both levels. Not to mention being a commentator on 
NFL’s Monday Night Football for 29 years.

He had been to the mountaintop, but had only been 

to a half-dozen Michigan games since graduating in 
1970.

“I hadn’t been in a college environment in 43 years,” 

Dierdorf said. “When I saw the band come out, I just 
got lost in the moment. I knew what it was about, but I 
had forgotten what it felt like to be a part of it.”

For 68 years, the voice of Michigan football belonged 

to just two people. Bob Ufer held the title from 1945-
81 before passing the torch to Frank Beckmann until 
he retired in 2013. So when Brandstatter switched to 
play-by-play and Dierdorf came out of retirement to 
join him in the booth in 2014, both admitted they had a 
tough act to follow.

But with nothing to lose and their careers almost 

over, the former teammates on Bo Schembechler’s first 
team are turning what could be seen as a victory lap 
into the third installment of one of the most important 
positions for the Michigan football team — its voice.

***

When Bob Ufer first began broadcasting Michigan 

football games for WPAG in 1945, it was in many ways a 
hobby. After playing for Michigan’s freshman football 
team, Ufer found his niche in track, even setting the 
world record in the 440-yard dash.

To stay healthy, he had to leave football. But in 

broadcasting, he had a chance to return, and he made 
sure to make his comeback a memorable one.

“Clearly, Ufer was the man — there wasn’t anybody 

in the same zip code as Bob Ufer,” Brandstatter 
said. “There’s no comparison to the unparalleled 
enthusiasm he had for Michigan football. Here was a 
guy out making a living at business and succeeding at it 
too, advocating himself for broadcasting, and he really 
made it his own, and when somebody does that, that’s 
a special thing.”

Whether 
it 
was 
catchphrases, 
long-winded 

soliloquies of the sheer joy of Michigan football, or an 
exuberance that made General Patton’s Jeep horn — 
used after Michigan scores — seem tame on air, Ufer 
turned a tiring job into a performance.

But it wasn’t just on game day. Ufer prepared for 363 

consecutive Michigan games with a preparation that 
would rival what the teams playing on the field below 
put forth.

Some days that meant using former assistant coach 

Jack Harbaugh’s film room to re-broadcast past games, 
others it meant scribbling notes about every player 
on 3-by-5 index cards — only 25 percent of which he 
would ever use. But every day, the passion for Michigan 
football was there.

“There was universal respect for Bob Ufer,” said 

his son, Tom Ufer, who spotted for his father in the 
mid-70’s. “We’d go to away games and see other 
broadcasters preparing things he had memorized 
three days ago. I remember (famed sports writer) Joe 
Falls would joke that you could paint a block of wood 
black, and Dad would still be able to describe what was 
happening to it for four hours.”

It helped, of course, that Michigan became the 

nation’s winningest program during Ufer’s 37-year 
run. Riding the highs of Crisler, Oosterbaan and 
Schembechler, Ufer was delectably biased, elevating 
Michigan fans with every big play and win.

“Broadcasting to some degree was changing, and 

Bob never changed. It was all Michigan all the time,” 
Brandstatter said. “When he got up in front of a 
microphone, it was like someone turned on a switch 
and he became this conduit of history. It was as if the 
Bentley Library opened and came out from Bob Ufer’s 
mouth. From Fielding Yost to Bennie Oosterbaan, the 
entire history of Michigan football would bubble up 
within him, and he would put it together with such 
prose — it was a special talent.

“You can’t emulate what he did.”
Ufer’s unwavering energy carried from his college 

days until his dying days. After a battle with prostate 
cancer that lasted years, Ufer finally called it quits 

following the Wolverines’ loss to Iowa on Oct. 
17, 1981.

He died nine days later.
“I won’t say he became more than the game, 

but he was a part of the game,” Dierdorf said. 
“When you mention Michigan legends like 
Schembechler, Canham, Crisler, he has to be on 
the list. Michigan wasn’t the only school with 
a play-by-play guy that could do that, but you 
won’t find many that had the impact that he did.

***

If Ufer made the broadcaster a part of the 

team, Frank Beckmann made the position one 
of a franchise player. A Hall of Fame broadcaster 
in his own right, Beckmann brought Michigan 
football games to the age of objectivity and 
information. But having to succeed both Ufer 
and famed Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell, 
he knew better than to leave the legends behind.

“Frank had his own way of creating a special 

moment,” said Brandstatter, who did color 
commentary next to Beckmann from 1984 to 
2013. “Things that came out of his mouth, and 
they were all ad-lib type stuff, always gave the 
listener a memory.”

It could be Denard Robinson’s shoelaces 

flapping in the wind, Rueben Riley laying 
the blade down or polishing off the Heisman 
and clearing space on the mantle for Charles 
Woodson after a late interception against Ohio 
State in 1997.

Beckmann knew his listeners were the 

unfortunate ones who couldn’t be in the 
Big House, and he made sure to deliver the 
memories from inside it to the airwaves.

“It was just beautiful the way he did it,” 

Brandstatter said of the Woodson call. “I was 
the color guy next to him just listening to it, 
and I didn’t even respond. I just stood back and 

I clapped, because that was such a beautifully 
done, big-play moment.

“He had that spur-of-the-moment, special 

way of saying something that creates a splash 
that gave the play a little extra color.”

So when Beckmann resigned after the 2013 

season, Michigan was once again missing a 
member of its team and had to hold tryouts to 
replace a legend.

***

When Brandstatter speaks, shades of Ufer 

and Beckmann come out. At his weekly Inside 
Michigan Football show at Pizza House, he 
grips the table and bubbles with eagerness 
while players and coaches talk. During 
commercials, he’ll get the whole restaurant to 
wish patrons a happy birthday, and chat with 
anyone who will listen.

Playing 
for 
former 
Michigan 
coach 

Bo Schembechler from 1969 to 1971 and 
broadcasting in the area practically ever since, 
Brandstatter has long felt like a member of the 
team, but never thought he would be the next 
voice of Michigan football.

It wasn’t until the search for Beckmann’s 

replacement carried into January, 2014 that 
Brandstatter put his name in the hat. Like past 
coaching searches, the committee wanted a 
Michigan man, but there weren’t very many.

Unsure when his future broadcast partner 

would be decided and remembering the play-
by-play bug he caught in the 1970s and 1980s, 
Brandstatter pulled up his only recent play-by-
play tape — a 2003 Northwestern game when 
Beckmann was recovering from back surgery 
— and sent it in.

With his longstanding ties to the program, it 

was all the committee needed.

With Brandstatter making the switch, the 

hole in the lineup shifted to the analyst, but this 
time, then-Michigan Athletic Director Dave 
Brandon had a target in mind.

“I was done,” Dierdorf said. “I was retired 

and happy to be so. But (Brandon) called me up 
and congratulated me, then told me I was going 
to be broadcasting Michigan games. I said ‘No, 
I’m not. I’m retired.’ ”

But Brandon, a former teammate and long-

time friend of Dierdorf’s known for strong 
negotiation tactics, was persistent. After a 
slew of calls, the argument tipped in favor of 
Dierdorf making a weekly pilgrimage to Ann 
Arbor to join Brandstatter in the booth.

Like Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh coming 

back from the peaks of the NFL, the connections 
at Michigan were too strong to pass up.

“It’s a unique opportunity,” Dierdorf said. 

“I had no intention of working again, but I had 
known (Brandstatter) over 40 years and had 
nothing but fond memories of Michigan, so I 
said ‘Why not?’ ”

Added Tom Ufer: “He’s the best color guy 

out there, especially for Michigan games. 
He’s been through it all, he knows it all and 
he loves Michigan. What more could you 
possibly ask for?”

***

Coming from the Bo Schembechler school 

of humility, Brandstatter has trouble thinking 
of what his style of broadcasting is. But if one 
listens to the pair, it’s clear that the third set of 
voices of Michigan football is working.

Eighteen games in, the two still have giddy 

conversations 
about 
football, 
successful 

Michigan teams and each other. Not every 
moment has been as cheeky as Michigan’s 
current three-game shutout streak, but with 
nothing to prove, any frustration goes out the 

window as soon as they step into the booth.

“Both of us are kind of where we want to be,” 

Brandstatter said. “We’re not interested in any 
jobs after this. A few decades ago, we might’ve 
been, but right now, we just want to deliver the 
memories of Michigan football to our listeners 
— whether they’re in the car, working in their 
backyard or whatever — and have fun doing it. 
It’s not rocket science.”

Added Dierdorf: “When I was in the NFL, 

broadcasting was so much of a business. … I 
used to have to wear a suit and tie to every 
game. Now I wear a Michigan pullover and a 
Michigan baseball cap and talk football with 
my buddy. I don’t have an agenda, I’m just 
hanging with my buddy.”

It doesn’t take long to feel the friendship. 

Whether it’s marveling over the Wolverines’ 
defensive line or bantering about missed 
assignments four decades ago, a broadcast can 
feel like you’re eavesdropping on a living-room 
tailgate.

But while the two go back 45 years, they also 

have 60 years of broadcasting experience, and 
have been in the shoes of the players below.

“They’ve worn the jocks,” Tom Ufer said. 

“And people notice that and respect that. When 
they say a play was good or an injury hurts, you 
really feel it.”

With nothing left to prove or push for, it 

would be easy for the passion to fade. But 
this season, with plenty of parallels to the 
Schembechler era, there’s a special connection, 
as that year was the year both fell in love with 
Michigan, and both want to make that feeling 
possible for everyone.

“It’s in my DNA. I can feel the big games and 

the big moments, and you don’t want to miss 
those,” Dierdorf said. “It doesn’t take much to 
get Jim up either.

“It’s just who we are.”

Wolverines trying to 
treat Saturday like 

any other game

By MAX COHEN

Managing Sports Editor

As the No. 12 Michigan football 

team 
enters 
Saturday’s 
game 

against No. 7 Michigan State, it 
appears 
to 
be 

on the precipice 
of 
something 

special, a level of 
success that has 
not been seen in 
recent program 
history.

The 

Wolverines have 
rattled off five 
straight 
wins, 

the last three of 
which have been 
shutouts. 
The 

national 
hype 

train has begun, 
and the praise 
for Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh 
has been effusive. Pundits are 
suddenly picking the Wolverines 

to make some noise, and the fans 
are starting to believe.

But one obstacle stands in 

the way of full-blown mania. 
The 
Spartans 
(2-0 
Big 
Ten, 

6-0 
overall) 
haven’t 
won 
as 

convincingly as Michigan, but 
are 
a 
threatening 
opponent 

nonetheless. Michigan State has 
dominated the Wolverines (2-0, 
5-1) by a combined score of 64-17 
the last two years, but Michigan 
does not seem to care.

Harbaugh 
dismissed 
all 

questions about the past at his 
weekly press conference Monday, 
and Michigan’s players largely 
did the same. Harbaugh and 
his assistant coaches have been 
staunch in their belief that if their 
team plays 100 percent every 
week, then it’s impossible to put 
extra emphasis on a rivalry game.

“We’ve just been going about 

our 
business 
down 
there 
at 

Schembechler Hall, and I’m sure 
that there will be a lot of attempts 
made to make it … it’s already 
big,” Harbaugh said. “The game is 
big enough. Fair, healthy, honest 
competition with a heck of a good 
opponent. That’s enough.”

The refrain about fair, healthy, 

honest 
competition 
is 
one 

Harbaugh has often repeated this 
season. In his mind, the fact that a 
rival happens to be the opponent 
does not increase the competition.

Before his first game for the 

Paul Bunyan Trophy, Michigan 
passing game coordinator Jedd 
Fisch 
didn’t 
notice 
anything 

different about 
the atmosphere 
at Schembechler 
Hall. 

“There’s 

always 
an 

intensity in this 
building,” Fisch 
said Wednesday. 
“There’s 
a 

determination 
to 
win 
every 

game and play as 
hard as we possibly can. I haven’t 
seen much of a difference because 
of the fact that that would kind of 
go against our whole philosophy.”

Defensive 
line 
coach 
Greg 

Mattison 
experienced 
the 

program’s 
former 
philosophy 

about rivalry weeks under Brady 
Hoke. 
Countdown 
clocks 
to 

rivalry games adorned the walls of 
Schembechler Hall, and there was 

little question as to which games 
(Notre Dame, Michigan State and 
Ohio State) were more important 
than the others.

But with the arrival of the new 

staff, Mattison has changed, too. 
He believes the importance of 
rivalry games is inherent in their 
nature.

“I 
think 

when you’re at 
Michigan 
you 

understand 
exactly … we’ve 
always 
talked 

about this, and 
they understand 
it already, that 
when you’re at 
Michigan, 
the 

expectations 
are very, very 

high,” Mattison said Wednesday. 
“Whoever you’re playing, that’s 
a big game because you have to 
play up to what’s expected as a 
Michigan football player, so I think 
they look at each game that way.”

Mattison’s unit will be charged 

with 
rattling 
Michigan 
State 

quarterback Connor Cook, who has 
defeated the Wolverines in each of 
the past two seasons. Harbaugh 

said on multiple occasions this 
week that Cook’s record as a 
starter (29-3) stands out to him. 
The fifth-year senior has thrown 12 
touchdowns and two interceptions 
so far this season.

Michigan’s 
own 
fifth-year 

senior quarterback will also face 
an increased challenge this week. 
Jake Rudock has steadied after 
his three-interception showing 
at Utah, but defeating Michigan 
State could require a performance 
of another level. The Wolverines’ 
recent dominance has left the 
pressure off Michigan’s passing 
offense late in games.

Rudock, his coaches say, is 

hard to faze. The Spartans will do 
their best to change that, but their 
success is no guarantee. 

Harbaugh 
has 
remained 

steadfast 
in 
his 
belief 
that 

Saturday’s game is just another 
one, a statement that could help 
his players after years of getting 
hyped up for the game before 
falling. But if the Wolverines win, 
the hype will continue to grow. 

And 
when 
Michigan 
plays 

Minnesota in two weeks, that, too, 
will be just another game. At least 
in Harbaugh’s eyes.

Meet the men who guard the ‘M’

Theta Xi fraternity 
guards Diag block 
‘M’ during MSU 

rivalry week

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

The first thing they’ll tell you 

is that they aren’t technically 
supposed to talk to reporters. 
Then they’ll offer you a cookie.

They sit on two couches, with 

three camping chairs adjacent, 
under a large tent in the center of 
the Diag. A white-and-sky-blue 
flag hangs from the north end of 
the tent with an orange unicorn 
in its center. There are three 
students sitting watch, for now, 
but more will arrive soon. It’s 
Tuesday night, and it’s cold out.

A basketball hoop stands about 

15 feet away, the front of its rim 
dented flat, but still usable to pass 
the time this week. From Sunday 
to Saturday, these students will sit, 
eat and pass time in and around 
this tent, waiting for a threat that 
may never come.

These are the men who guard 

the ‘M’ in the center of the Diag 
from 
vandalism. 
Throughout 

the night, appreciative students 
passing 
by 
will 
shout 
their 

thanks. At 10:08 p.m., a student 
approaches the tent bearing a gift 
— more cookies.

“That happens every once in 

a while,” says Brandon Lyons, a 
junior computer science major.

It happens again around 10:35 

p.m.

Since 1999, Theta Xi fraternity 

has been in charge of protecting 
the Diag ‘M’ during Michigan 
State rivalry week. This year, 
Delta Phi Epsilon sorority has 
helped out during the day. Each 
member is required to spend eight 
hours throughout the week at the 
‘M,’ with new pledges required 
to spend 18. There are six shifts 
available, and according to Lyons 
and Ben Lampert, a sophomore 
astronomy 
and 
astrophysics 

major, there has been no problem 
filling the shifts.

As of Tuesday, Lyons estimates 

he has spent six hours on guard 
each night, and while the primary 
cause is to protect the ‘M,’ the 
two Greek houses are also raising 
money 
for 
multiple 
sclerosis 

and cystic fibrosis through a 

GoFundMe page.

Lyons and Lampert are friendly, 

but they aren’t allowed to talk 
freely about the weeklong project 
until the Theta Xi philanthropy 
chair, sophomore business student 
Alex Tarowsky, arrives.

Lyons is studying for an exam he 

has to take Wednesday, and he just 
had one earlier Tuesday, too. But it 
hasn’t stopped him from spending 
large lumps of time on the Diag. 
He likes the bonding, and he is 
invested in protecting the ‘M.’

When Tarowsky arrives, the 

group can finally open up about 
the event.

“(It) really just started with a 

bunch of guys just getting sick 
of Michigan State, just trashing 
the ‘M,’ so they decided to do 
something about it and turn it 
into a big event and a fundraiser,” 
Tarowsky said.

Acts of vandalism between 

Michigan and Michigan State 
during rivalry week have become 
somewhat common. In recent 
years, Michigan fans have been 
suspected of defacing the Spartan 
statue 
in 
East 
Lansing, 
and 

sometime between Wednesday 

night and Thursday morning, the 
Magic Johnson statue outside of 
Michigan State’s Breslin Center 
was vandalized. A yellow block 
‘M’ was painted on the statue’s 
chest, and ‘Beat State’ was written 
on its base.

Last year, the Diag ‘M’ was 

painted 
green, 
which 
Theta 

Xi says was the result of a 
“miscommunication” 
with 
the 

University — a “fluke” that won’t 
happen again. 

And 
by 

spending 
the 

week guarding 
the 
Diag, 

Theta 
Xi 
can 

reasonably 
assure that the 
‘M’ will remain 
intact this year. 
To 
pass 
the 

time, 
brothers 

have done all kinds of things.

They host events, including 

a free-throw shooting contest, 
cornhole and pie-a-Xi. They do 
homework — one pledge, Michael 
Lee, is working on a paper in 
which 
he 
applies 
Freudian 

psychology to German fairytales. 

And, of course, they socialize. 
Tuesday night, they had a long 
dialogue about their favorite 
bathrooms in the house and 
planning how to get a TV to the 
Diag for the next night.

And then there’s the free 

food. Pizza House and the Blue 
Leprechaun 
are 
sponsoring 

the event, and students bring 
them food throughout the week. 
They’ve gotten coffee, pizza and 

many, 
many 

cookies. 
At 

lunchtime 
on 

Tuesday, 
they 

said a walking 
burrito from Get 
Some 
Burritos 

brought 
them 

lunch.

But all of this 

leaves one fairly 
substantial 

question. What happens if a 
would-be-vandal does show up?

“We would do whatever we 

could to make sure this ‘M’ isn’t 
painted,” Tarowsky said. “We 
would push these couches over 
it. I guess we would probably call 
911. We’re gonna get water guns. I 

don’t know why we didn’t do it yet, 
but we want to get water guns.”

None of them were on the ‘M’ 

Sunday, but there is talk amongst 
them about some questionable 
activity.

“There were some suspicious 

looking guys we saw camping 
around,” Tarowsky said. “One of 
them approached us and started 
asking 
questions 
you 
would 

expect, like, ‘How many of you 
guys are going to be here all the 
time? What hours? Do you guys 
ever leave?’ I wasn’t here at the 
time, but apparently he motioned 
to his friends to leave once he was 
done asking the questions.”

Tarowsky 
eventually 
leaves 

the tent, and the night continues. 
Pledges show up for serenade 
practice and a large group of 
brothers plays basketball. Word 
has it that it’s someone’s birthday 
at midnight, and he’ll be spending 
it guarding the ‘M.’ It feels like a 
party already.

By 3:31 a.m., four members 

remain at the tent. Three are 
awake, all on their laptops, and 
one is asleep. The fun has gone. 
They’re simply on duty.

ALLISON FARRAND/Daily

All week, the Theta Xi fraternity brothers have camped out in the middle of the Diag to protect the block ‘M’ from being vandalized during Michigan State rivalry week.

“I guess we would 
probably call 911. 
We’re gonna get 

water guns.”

Behind Enemy Lines: Shilique Calhoun

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

In his career at Michigan 

State, fifth-year senior defensive 
end Shilique Calhoun has made 
a habit out 
of wreaking 
havoc 
in 

backfields 
and 
collecting 
hardware. 
He is a two-

time second-team All-American 
and the Big Ten’s 2013 Defensive 
Lineman of the Year. 

But in his final season in East 

Lansing, his former defensive 
coordinator, 
Pat 
Narduzzi, 
is 

no longer with him. Narduzzi 
left to become the head coach 
at Pittsburgh this year, leaving 
behind 
a 
defense 
that 
was 

consistently among the nation’s 
best.

The 
Daily 
sat 
down 
with 

Calhoun at Big Ten Media days 

in August for a discussion about 
Narduzzi, Jim Harbaugh and the 
NCAA.

The Michigan Daily: What did 

you like about playing for Coach 
(Pat) Narduzzi, and what do you 
miss about it?

Shilique Calhoun: I like the 

fact that Coach Narduzzi, you 
know, he never lets down. He’s 
always high-intensity. He’s going 
to be that crazy guy. He’s kind of 
like a fan. He’s a fan in a coach 
form. He wants to see you do 
better, he knows you can do better. 
He’s gonna tell you how much 
you should be doing better, and 
I 
think 
that’s 

exactly what I’ll 
miss about him. 
How 
wild 
he 

was, how crazy 
and how much 
in love with the 
game he was, 
and in love with 
us as players he 
was.

But we have 

great 
coaches, 

Coach Tressel, Coach Burton, 
Coach Barnett, that are definitely 
going to step up and do a great job, 
and they’ve been doing a great job 
for so long. It wasn’t just Narduzzi, 
but I will miss him, because that is 
my guy.

TMD: How different will the 

defense be without Narduzzi?

SC: We’ll still be the same 

Spartan Dawgs. I mean, that’s 
who we are. Our coaching staff 

does a great job of, you know — 
it was never a point where we 
felt like Coach Narduzzi was 
handling everything. Everyone 
had a hand in everything that we 
did. So there’s gonna be no need 
for picking up the slack. He’s 
irreplaceable because he’s Coach 
Narduzzi, but at the same time, 
he would have never left us in a 
terrible condition.

He understands what we have, 

and he understands the potential 
that we have, and he understands 
the potential we have as players 
and coaches. So I know we’re 
going to have a great year. We’re 

still 
going 
to 

have that same 
swarming-
to-the-ball 
defense, 
all 

green 
helmets 

on 
everything. 

That 
live 

sideline, 
he’s 

not 
gonna 
be 

coming down it 
this year in the 
fourth quarter, 

but somebody will.

TMD: What do you think about 

all the attention on Jim Harbaugh 
and Michigan football the last six 
months?

SC: No comment? I’ll leave it at 

that. No comment.

TMD: The NCAA makes a point 

to say that student-athletes are 
treated the same as students, but 
the punishments are a lot harsher. 
How does that strike you?

SC: They’re harsher? I hadn’t 

noticed (laughs). No, I think 
because we’re in the public eye, 
and not only that, but (because) 
we’re stereotyped as role models 
so early on. Even straight out of 
high school, little kids look up 
to us. So I do understand why 
they do it and why it’s so harsh. 
But at the same time, I think the 
university should probably look 
at it as, we are still kids. 17-, 18-, 
19-year old people coming out 
of high school, who ... we’re still 
learning.

I’m a little older and a little 

wiser to know you can’t do 
(certain) things like that. But 
some guys are really young, and 
they don’t know any better. And 
of course they have to be taught 
a lesson, but I don’t think it 
should be as harsh sometimes. I 
don’t think, sometimes, that the 
hammer should be brought down 
on us, because we are just regular 
students. Even though we do play 
football, we are regular students 
also.

TMD: Is it actually helping 

anyone to have those harsher 
punishments?

SC: I think it does. I think for 

people who are moreso hard-
headed. I think that it helps them 
realize that it doesn’t matter 
who you are — you’re going to be 
punished for what you’re doing. If 
you’re not doing the right thing, 
it’s going to be brought to the light, 
and you’re gonna, you know, reap 
what you sow.
