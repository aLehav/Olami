Speaker addresses status 
of youth in photography of 
the global refugee crisis

Speaker series talks repre-
sentation of displaced children 
Tuesday night at the Benzinger 
Library in East Quad, around 30 
students from the class run by the 
Residential College, Displaced 
Children in an Uncertain World, 
gathered for a discussion run 
by David Choberka, manager of 
academic outreach and a teacher 
at the University of Michigan 
Museum of Art.
The class, run by Residen-
tial College lecturer Elizabeth 
Goodenough, is a half-semester, 
interdisciplinary 
mini-course 
that aims to explore how differ-
ent types of mediums such as 
contemporary film, global media, 
classical literature and autobiog-
raphies represent children suf-
fering from displacement, war 
and family separation.
Ultimately, the class aims 
to encourage students to think 
about storytelling through both 
visual and verbal media. Good-
enough explained more specifi-
cally that the class aims to show 
how those works of arts influence 
their understanding of contem-
porary events and ancient stories.

On Feb. 14, 2018 — one 
year ago today — a young 
gunman 
opened 
fire 
at 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High School in Parkland, Fla, 
leaving 17 people dead. This 
shooting was not the first of its 
kind. At this point, the United 
States had seen a number of 
other school shootings. And 
since Parkland, a wave of 
activism and media attention 
has gripped the nation as 
students 
from 
Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas publicly 
demand stricter gun control.
A month after the shooting, 
thousands 
of 
students 
nationwide walked out of 

their 
schools 
to 
protest 
gun violence. Students in 
Washtenaw County held a 
rally hosted by the newly 
formed 
Washtenaw 
Youth 
Initiative, an activist group of 
high school students formed 
in reaction to the Parkland 
shooting.
Zaynab Elkolaly, a senior 
at 
Washtenaw 
Technical 
Middle College and member 
of the WYI executive board, 
reflected 
on 
the 
reasons 
the 
Parkland 
shooting 
garnered so much attention. 
She specifically noted how 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas’ 
status as a predominantly 
white, wealthy school drew 
more sympathy.

Internet 
celebrity 
Deme-
trius Harmon spoke to an 
overflowing 
auditorium 
of 
University 
students 
at 
Weiser Hall regarding men-
tal health in communities of 
color Wednesday as a part of 

NAACP Week and Black His-
tory Month. Harmon, known 
to his fans as Meech, has found 
fame on Vine, YouTube, Twit-
ter and other social media plat-
forms. He now owns a clothing 
label that advocates for mental 
health awareness.
Harmon began by discuss-

ing the stigma associated with 
talking about mental health 
problems.
“That pressure, sometimes it 
can make diamonds and some-
times it could make you dust,” 
Harmon said.
Harmon focused on how the 
Black community can place 

rigid requirements on its mem-
bers, making them doubt how 
they carry themselves and the 
things they choose to do with 
their time. Harmon explained 
that many people put on a 
facade of strength because 
they feel it is expected of them.

On Wednesday night, spokes-
people from the Carceral State 
Project hosted a town hall dis-
cussion for students, faculty 
and community members to 
debate the University of Michi-
gan’s recently announced policy, 
which states that affiliates who 
are charged or convicted of a 
felony have to report it within 
a week. The policy has sparked 
controversy on campus. The 
town hall discussion on the 
change followed a roundtable 
discussion hosted by the Car-
ceral State Project about the 
intersection of incarceration in 
America and everyday life. 
Adam, a formerly incarcer-

ated individual who declined 
to provide his last name, spoke 
during the town hall. A potential 
candidate for graduate school at 
the University, he spent three 
years in prison due to a nonvio-
lent, internet-based sex offense 
that occurred a decade ago. Since 
leaving prison, he obtained a 
bachelor’s degree in social work 
at another institution, but said he 
was worried about how the new 
policy will impact the potential 
to further his education at the 
University.
“I am fearful about this whole 
thing in a number of different 
respects,” Adam said “...Even if I 
was to get admitted, at the end of 
the road… would I even be able to 
get employed? Because thus far, 
having graduated almost a year 

ago, I have not been able to get 
into my field.” 
Multiple students and faculty 
also brought up questions and 
concerns about how the policy 
will unfairly target minorities 
who are already underrepre-
sented at the University. Some 
attendees said the policy could 
discourage them even more from 
applying to study and work here.
LSA sophomore Zoey Horow-
itz, who works with the Prison 
Creative Arts Project, said the 
policy would affect not only 
potential students and faculty, 
but all people at the University. 
“We’re not only shutting out 
a lot of job opportunities, but 
even for those who have not been 
affected by the criminal justice 
system, we are stopping a lot of 

learning before it can happen,” 
Horowitz said. 
University spokesman Rick 
Fitzgerald attended the event 
and defended the University’s 
policy to The Daily.
“The policy speaks for itself,” 
Fitzgerald 
said. 
“There’s 
an 
extensive Q & A posted on the 
HR website to try to bring some 
clarity to a lot of these ques-
tions, we’ve heard many of these 
questions and tried to respond 
to them in that way through the 
context of the policy.” 
In an email sent to The Daily 
after 
the 
event, 
Fitzgerald 
emphasized that the policy did 
not apply to a person’s previous 
criminal history.


On Wednesday, about 50 
people gathered for the first in 
a series of luncheons in honor 
of Martin Luther King, Jr. at the 
Lurie Biomedical Engineering 
Building. The event was hosted 
by the Center for Engineering 
Diversity and Outreach and Tau 
Beta Pi, an engineering honors 
society.
The event began with a pre-
sentation by two executive 
board members of WeListen, 

a club that strives to bridge 
the political divide through 
respectful discussion of con-
troversial 
issues.Engineering 
junior Arushi Agarwal, the 
campus outreach officer for 
Tau Beta Pi and organizer of 
the luncheon, introduced the 
speakers with a brief explana-
tion of the purpose of the lun-
cheon.
“One of Tau Beta Pi’s mis-
sions is to expand the knowl-
edge and understanding of en-
gineers beyond technical fields, 
so that is one of the missions of 

this luncheon series,” Agrawal 
said.
While presenting, WeListen 
co-President Kate Westa ad-
dressed the hesitance engineer-
ing students might have about 
a politically-focused club, and 
ensured them all students are 
encouraged to participate re-
gardless of prior knowledge.
“We bring students from all 
across campus, all majors, all 
backgrounds, any person who’s 
interested,” Westa said.
Agrawal told The Daily after 
the event that having WeLis-
ten representatives speak at 
the luncheon served to help 
broaden student involvement 
outside of engineering.
“I think the goal (of the lun-
cheon series) is really to give 
engineers exposure to some-
thing beyond just technical 
fields,” Agrawal said. “Usually 
it’s focused towards some-
thing that MLK exemplified 
— diversity, inclusion, some-
thing like that.”
Following 
the 
WeListen 
presentation, Fred L. Terry, 
Jr., professor of electrical 
engineering 
and 
computer 
science, spoke about the im-
portance of diversity and in-
clusion in engineering.
Terry presented on his own 
role in diversity and inclusion 
at the University. Terry was 
recently awarded the 2019 
North Campus Deans’ MLK 
Spirit Award at the Univer-
sity’s Martin Luther King, Jr. 
symposium on January 21. 
He is also a member of the 
First Generation Engineering 
Advisory Committee and the 
Electrical and Computer En-
gineering Committee for an 

Inclusive Department.
In his speech he explained 
how his experiences in aca-
demia have shaped him into 
someone who values diversity, 
equity and inclusion.
“I want to emphasize the 
importance of a growth mind-
set,” Terry said. “I think that’s 
something really critical in gen-
eral, but certainly in the area 
of diversity, equity, and inclu-
sion, and how we relate to each 
other.”
Terry also praised the WeLis-
ten initiative to foster conversa-
tion between polarized groups.
“I really admire them be-
cause I think it’s really critical 
that we actual talk to each other 
in a civil and reasoned way and 
get to know each other because 
that’s really a big part of human 
understanding,” Terry said.
Terry concluded his speech 
with a focus on the importance 
of growth, the impact of role 
models and the difficulty of 
change.
“Achieving true equity and 
inclusion in our classrooms is 
going to require a continuing 
effort and education of us who 
are running the classes,” Terry 
said.
Bruna Menezes, a Rackham 
student and member of Tau Beta 
Pi, told The Daily she found out 
about the event through the 
honors society and wanted to 
learn more about diversity, eq-
uity and inclusion events at the 
University.
“I’m very passionate about 
the subjects Tau Beta Pi has, 
and I didn’t even know the 
topics but I knew they always 
brings something very interest-
ing,” Menezes said.

MICHIGAN DAILY ALUMNI TALK

ALEC COHEN/Daily
Former Michigan Daily photographer Dhani Jones and businessman Howard Luckoff speak on their experiences working in 
the business industry in the Student Publications Building Wednesday.

“School shootings and kids being 
shot in schools, not necessarily just 
mass shootings, have been very, very 
common before Parkland,” Elkolaly 
said. “But the thing is Parkland, a 
white, suburban school, was the 
catalyst needed for the gun violence 
prevention movement. This happens 
in areas that are predominantly black 
and less wealthy all the time. But you 
can tell that the government only 
really cares when there are wealthier 
students on the line.”
Elkolaly said she has continued 
to see this whitewashing in the gun 
safety movement in the year since 
Parkland.
“I 
learned 
further 
how 
whitewashed the movement really is,” 
Elkolaly said. “Like any organization, 
Washtenaw Youth Initiative has its 
flaws. Many people don’t want to 
join because it is a predominantly 
white group when gun violence 
affects people of color more … there’s 
still a socioeconomic discrepancy in 
activism. It’s extracurricular for some 
and a mode of survival for others.”
These 
observations, 
Elkolaly 
said, show how much the movement 
needs 
to 
include 
intersectional 
voices. Keeping this in mind, Elkolaly 
emphasized her appreciation of 
the work of the student activists 
from Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High School. But Elkolaly noted 
it’s important to understand how 
privilege helped them succeed.
“I don’t want to discredit what the 
Parkland kids have done,” Elkolaly 
said. “They’re absolutely amazing and 
they started this massive movement. 
But it was definitely their privilege 
that helped them get there.”
Public Policy senior Kellie Lounds, 
chair of the University of Michigan’s 
chapter of College Democrats, echoed 
many of Elkolaly’s points, applauding 
the work of young activists and 
bringing to attention the fact that gun 
violence most frequently affects low-
income communities of color. 
“It’s a problem in low-income 
communities and communities of 
color and all sorts of other groups 
that don’t get the spotlight,” Lounds 
said. “And so I think activists helping 
acknowledge that while also using 
their experiences to elevate how 
important this issue has been a big 
change in this past year especially 
with the activism of the kids from 
Stoneman Douglas.”
LSA sophomore Dylan Berger, 
president of the University’s chapter 
of 
College 
Republicans 
and 
a 
columnist in the Opinion section of 
The Daily, said the focus on issues 
concerning gun violence and gun 
control is the result of numerous 
shootings, and that the Parkland 
students’ activism is what brought 
the issue further into the spotlight. 
Berger said while he strongly believes 
in citizens’ rights to the Second 
Amendment, a position not held by 
many of the student activists, he 
appreciates the conversation being 
brought to the table.
“I think the Stoneman Douglas 
shooting was the straw that broke 
the camel’s back in that now that the 
shooting has happened and a whole 
bunch of intelligent young people, 
whether we agree or disagree with 
them, are coming out and speaking 
on this issue, people are paying 
attention,” Berger said. “I disagree 
with a lot of what activists have said 
on the issue of Second Amendment, 
but I appreciate that they’re bringing 
up the issue. We need to discuss it.”
Outside of activism and political 
realms, faculty and staff within the 
University work in various ways to 
combat gun violence. John-Mark 
Branch, a police sergeant within 
the Division of Public Safety and 
Security, is the police response 
expert for active attackers. Branch 
said DPSS has been trained in active 
shooter response consistently since 
the Columbine shooting in 1999. He 
explained Parkland did not affect 
their efforts, as they were already up 
to par, but DPSS reviewed Parkland 
along with all other shootings that 
occurred throughout the year for 
safety risks.
“We have actually been one of 
the departments in the county who’s 
been training active shooter since 
Columbine,” Branch said. “We have 
several active shooter instructors… 
I am an instructor for that. We 
do refreshers, courses every year, 
we do annual training for active 
attackers, active shooters … There’s 
so many (shootings) that happen 
throughout the year, obviously we 
get that information, we review 
(the response) — what went wrong, 
what went right … but as far as our 
response, it pretty much hasn’t 
changed.”
Branch said DPSS’ active attacker 
response protocol is to immediately 
send a dispatch to the location once 
they’re made aware of an active 

attacker and to respond based on 
the specifics of the situation. If the 
attacker is inside, officers will enter 
the building and stop the threat as 
quickly as possible. The approach is 
also affected by the type of weapon, 
as a firearm is more dangerous than, 
for example, a baseball bat.
According to Branch, all of the 
Washtenaw County police agencies 
are trained for active attacker 
response in the same way. Branch 
is a member of the SWAT team 
that conducts an annual refresher 
course for the county in this training. 
Branch said SWAT makes sure all the 
local police forces are on the same 
page.
“In 
Washtenaw 
County, 
we 
have the metro SWAT team that is 
comprised of University of Michigan 
police, Washtenaw County Sheriff, 
Ann Arbor City, Ypsilanti Police, 
Pittsfield Township and I believe 
Eastern Michigan,” Branch said. 
“I’m a team leader on the SWAT team 
there and our SWAT team does the 
annual active attacker training each 
year. So every agency in the county is 
trained the same way.”
DPSS also holds active shooter 
presentations for faculty, staff and 
students within the University. 
Branch said the active attacker 
safety tips DPSS recommends are 
encompassed in three words: run, 
hide and fight. These methods 
are taught to incoming University 
students 
during 
new 
student 
orientation. 
University 
faculty 
are 
also 
utilizing 
a 
research 
approach 
to gun violence. Patrick Carter, 
assistant professor of emergency 
medicine, is a leader on the Firearm 
Safety Among Children and Teens 
Consortium project. This initiative, 
aiming to prevent gun violence while 
taking into account gun ownership, 
launched a website in November 
2018 with data, fact sheets, videos 
and other resources regarding gun 
violence prevention.
Carter said in the aftermath of 
Parkland or any mass shooting, 
people bolster their efforts to reduce 
the problem of firearm injuries. He 
said it’s crucial to keep in mind gun 
violence greatly affects people on a 
smaller, daily scale as well.
“I think anytime there’s a mass 
shooting, it serves to redouble the 
efforts of people who are working 
in those fields, and I think we have 
to remember that the problem of 
firearm injuries is not just about the 
mass shootings,” Carter said. “We 
see those and they’re horrific and 
tragic events, but there’s also a daily 
toll related to gun violence that we 
have to remember that affects people 
too, that that is part of the prevention 
discussion.”
Doctors can only do so much to 
help a person injured by a firearm 
when they see them in an emergency 
room, Carter said. He explained 
the issue can be more effectively 
addressed by researching evidence-
based prevention measures.
“We see the end result within 
the medical field of injuries and 
frankly, given the legality of what I 
can do for a patient who comes into 
the emergency department or the 
hospital with a firearm injury, at that 
point we’re pretty far down in the 
spectrum in terms of my ability to 
intervene to help that person,” Carter 
said. “We can do so much more on 
the prevention end to prevent them 
from ending up in the emergency 
department in the first place if we 
apply evidence-based research and 
solutions to the problem.”
To base the team’s research in 
the community, Carter said the 
project incorporates perspectives 
of gun owners and trainers. This is 
important, he noted, in order to have 
a realistic conversation about the 
issue.
“I don’t think you can have a 
dialogue around how to solve this 
problem and approach evidence-
based solutions to the problem 
without engaging people… having 
the ability to own and use guns is an 
important part of the discussion so 
we find solutions that are gonna work 
and not fall through the cracks,” 
Carter said.
One year after the deadliest high 
school shooting in the U.S. history, 
acts of gun violence keep happening, 
including an incident at Central 
Michigan University in March 2018 
and a shooting at a synagogue in 
Pittsburgh in October. Yet the efforts 
surrounding gun violence continue 
— especially among activist youths, 
according to Elkolaly.
“I think we’ve discovered just 
how powerful the youth voice really 
is,” Elkolaly said. “Even if we’re 
minors and unable to vote, we have 
so much power. That’s really what I 
want young activists to know. First 
of all, your representatives serve you. 
You say jump, they say how high. And 
when you band together, you can 
accomplish so many great things.”

“These motifs that are impor-
tant to analyze because stories 
are as essential as sleep to being 
human,” Goodenough said. “If 
we don’t tell stories, we really 
lose who we are and who we 
become. Often, I think because 
we’re all quite pressed and 
overstimulated, we don’t ask 
ourselves questions about the 
existential realities of the stories 
we’re living. Are we living some-
body else’s story for us? Or at 
least we can become more aware 
of the guiding voices in our own 
stories.”
Part of the six-week class is a 
unique speaker series. All stu-
dents are required to attend the 
lectures by global experts such 
as historians, anthropologists, 
poets and filmmakers, whose 
perspectives provide insight on 
the challenges and complexi-
ties of the representation of dis-
placed children.
Goodenough believes these 
lectures are an essential aspect 
of the course, not only for her 
students to gain a fuller view of 
this topic, but also as her own 
learning tool.
“I taught the course because 
I wanted to learn more,” Goode-
nough said. “I mean, I’m trained 
in literary studies, not as an 
anthropologist, not as a profes-
sional academic historian, not 
as an art historian or interpreter 
of visual art. So, you go into this 

business of teaching because you 
want to keep learning.”
Choberka presented a series 
of photographs and lithographs 
by Peter Turney, a University of 
Michigan alum, featuring refu-
gees in places including 1999 
Albania or 1988 Malawi.
“A lot of what we do is teach 
thinking with images — how 
do images express things to us? 
How do we represent them?” 
Choberka said. “So that is an 
important part of our engage-
ment of any class, because 
images are such an important 
part of our cultures as depic-
tions of refugees are something 
we encounter in the news. It’s 
really just about what sort of 
meanings do these things bring 
up for us. My role is to put these 
interpretations into a sort of 
dialogue.”
Choberka 
encouraged 
stu-
dents to talk about the interpre-
tations, the meanings and the 
feelings the image brings up for 
them. He emphasized the mul-
tifaceted components of these 
images, and how the experience 
might be different for each per-
son as they bring in their own 
experiences into the picture. 
He wanted to talk about the 
complicated nature of these pic-
tures and perhaps the issues or 
questions that the pieces might 
inspire.
The discussion began with a 
photograph of four refugees in 
1999 Albania with a young boy 
in the center. Students ques-
tioned whether the child knew 

he was getting his picture taken, 
to what extent it was planned or 
spontaneous and whether or not 
the subjects were contemplat-
ing how to present themselves 
to the camera. Moreover, they 
wondered how they could use 
visual cues as indexes of expe-
riences that other people have 
had or in stories they’ve seen in 
the news.
LSA senior Kaithlyn Sanchez 
told The Daily the class has 
taught her to question the chil-
dren’s perspectives in times of 
chaos and displacement, instead 
of the artist’s views and to really 
pay attention to how they might 
feel.
“This class is about question-
ing how certain people want us 
to look at these displaced chil-
dren, whether it’s when they’re 
taking their picture or writing 
about them and if we can actu-
ally grab the full experience of 
what a child might think about 
a certain situation or what their 
headspace is,” Sanchez said. “It’s 
all about us trying to tap into 
how a children sees a situation, 
versus how we see it.”
Choberka noted that although 
the students are interacting with 
these images, they still are inter-
acting with them at a distance 
and inferring the type of story 
the image is trying to tell. They 
still don’t know any of the true 
context.
In 
another 
picture 
of 
a 
Mozambican refugee camp in 
Malawi in 1988, Choberka noted 
how the photographer has decid-

ed to show only a young child 
walking between two vertical 
rows of bright yellow restrooms. 
 
“I am very skeptical of this 
picture,” Choberka said. “The 
photographer has chosen to 
position himself so that we 
have a weirdly serial organized 
experience of these built struc-
tures — which has probably been 
brought in by outsiders to alle-
viate some of the problems they 
have had. To me, it says, ‘We 
have successfully helped these 
people! We have built structures 
in a very organized fashion.’ But, 
it could look more disorganized 
and worn down. There is no 
sense of urgency in the image, 
and it looks like the kid is hav-
ing a good time. Which is sug-
gestive of an order that has been 
imposed on a chaotic situation. 
But it could be total triumphant 
story.”
The students then began a 
discussion on the role the per-
son taking the picture plays into 
telling the story of these differ-
ent cultures, and the agency that 
the subjects have in telling their 
story to the viewer. Choberka 
emphasized that each image 
might be inadequate on their 
own as they only tell part of a 
story.
“It can be a much more com-
plex story and could potentially 
misrepresent them,” Choberka 
said. “Although it is one moment 
of fun, it could have been their 
one moment of fun that has only 
happened within the last few 
years.”

“It’s hard to do certain things 
while retaining your Blackness,” 
Harmon said. “And if we’re not 
accepted in our community, we feel 
like we’re not accepted in the world 
at all.”
Harmon stressed the fact that 
there is no prerequisite to Blackness 
beyond biology.
“To be Black is literally just have 
Black skin,” Harmon said. “Look 
down at your hands and your skin is 
Black, congratulations you’re Black. 
That’s just how that works.”
Harmon said from slavery to the 
civil rights movement, the Black 
community has always had more 
exterior problems than mental 
health, and now it has gotten to the 
point where they cannot be worried 
over more interior and personal 
issues. 
“That isn’t too long ago,” Har-
mon. “What mattered was your 
safety. They didn’t have the luxury 
to teach you about your emotions.”
Harmon also noted the ongoing 
struggle that the Black has faced 
regarding tragedy and violence. 
He surveyed the room, asking who 
remembered where they were in 
2012 when 17-year-old Trayvon 
Martin was shot and killed by a 
police officer in Sanford, Florida.
“That was like everything I 
learned about Black history was 
like, ‘Nah, we still here,’” Harmon 
said.
Harmon explained vulnerability 
is not seen as an option among Black 
people. He cited the musician Frank 
Ocean came under fire after coming 
out as bisexual. He said Ocean was 
ridiculed for being too effeminate 
or not Black enough, but that he did 
a great thing for the Black commu-
nity by coming out. Harmon said 
Ocean set the stage for other young, 

gay Black people to find their own 
identities in a safe, understanding 
context.
“Representation matters because 
it allows you to feel comfortable in 
your own space,” Harmon said.
Harmon encouraged others to 
follow Ocean’s example, taking 
risks in talking about how they feel 
to shift the paradigm.
“It’s so embedded in our DNA, 
so we have to undo it,” Harmon 
said. “We have to hold each other 
accountable. We have to raise our 
children better.”
Harmon said he wants to make 
a better life for his future children. 
He wants to help his mother retire, 
and he wants the rest of his family 
to have the luxury of rest which he 
said was a lot to hold on his shoul-
ders.
The event was put together by 
the University’s chapter of the 
NAACP and You Good Fam?, a peer-
based support group for students 
of color experiencing difficulties 
regarding their mental health. The 
event was also funded in part by the 
Black History Month committee 
under the University’s department 
of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs.
LSA senior Carlos Henderson is 
the health and awareness co-chair 
for the University’s NAACP chap-
ter. He told The Daily after the 
event that Harmon presents a relat-
able message to students because he 
is the same age and primarily uses 
social media to communicate his 
message of health, perseverance 
and positivity.
“This event was important in 
particular because Demetrius is a 
very big face in social media,” Hen-
derson said. “So we thought what’s 
a better way to connect with stu-
dents than to bring social media to 
the campus and also to bring aware-
ness about mental health?”
LSA senior Khadija Williams, 
president of You Good Fam? said 

she admired Harmon for his genu-
ineness. She said Harmon speaks 
from a place of empathy due to 
his own struggles with his mental 
health.
“(Harmon) deals with Black 
mental health in his own personal 
aspect of him having mental illness 
and being Black, using his platform 
to explain and go into how it affect-
ed him personally in the different 
situations that he’s been in,” Wil-
liams said.
Harmon grew up in Detroit. 
Many of his close friends and fam-
ily members attended the event, 
including his mother, grandmother 
and childhood best friend. As a local 
artist, students felt an even deeper 
connection to him and his work. 
LSA freshman Madison King has 
followed him through his presence 
on Vine, onto Twitter and now into 
mental health advocacy.
“I’ve always known about him, 
so I feel like I had to see him,” King 
said.
Harmon champions a mental 
health awareness campaign called 
“You Matter,” selling apparel and 
raising awareness about the preva-
lence and legitimacy of mental ill-
ness in the Black community.
Williams said You Good Fam? 
was founded to fill this gap in con-
versation. She wanted Black people 
to have somewhere to turn when 
they need to talk.
“For a Black person to have any-
thing with mental health or want-
ing to express the problems that 
they face with mental health, that is 
seen as a taboo in our families and 
it’s seen as something that is really 
talked down upon,” Williams said.
Public Health senior Halimat 
Olaniyan is head of MESA’s Black 
History Month committee. She said 
she and her fellow committee mem-
bers have witnessed firsthand the 
difficulty Black students have rais-
ing issues of mental health in their 

families and social circles. They 
wanted to address the issue with 
the programming they’re putting 
on. 
“A common thing that kept com-
ing up in the committee meetings 
was health, particularly mental 
health, because I think there’s a lot 
of stigma in the Black community 
around mental health,” Olaniyan 
said. “It’s not talked about. You’re 
considered kind of weak if you bring 
up that you’re having mental health 
issues and mental health concerns. 
(The NAACP and You Good Fam?) 
came to us about it, and it fit really 
well into what we wanted to do 
with mental health.”
LSA freshman Faith Crosby 
attended the event. She said she 
appreciated the timing of the pro-
gramming, noting that acknowl-
edging this issue during Black 
History Month provides the con-
text needed to understand and 
properly address the issue.
“I like that he came during 
Black History Month,” Crosby said. 
“Mental health in the Black com-
munity is such a taboo topic, now is 
the perfect time to talk about it.”
University students are feel-
ing that pressure more and more. 
Williams explained she wanted 
Harmon to come to speak during 
midterms and around Valentine’s 
Day because they are particularly 
stressful times of the year. 
“The main thing I want to accom-
plish from this event is to show stu-
dents that there are resources on 
this campus that are here to help 
them out,” Williams said.
This event was the beginning 
of the effort to enhance mental 
health awareness in the Black 
community.
“This event is something small 
on a wide agenda,” Williams said.

R

apid development in 
Ann Arbor and other 
areas 
of 
southeast 

Michigan has led to increasing 
friction between humans and 
their animal neighbors in 
recent years. Coyote attacks 
on cats and dogs are on the 
rise in the metro Detroit area. 
Despite 
both 
controversial 

culls and sterilization efforts, 
the Ann Arbor deer population 
has at best plateaued. And 
every few winters, as the sky 
darkens, 
students 
are 
left 

aghast as crows take to the 
skies over campus.

Every autumn, as other 

birds fly south for the winter, 
thousands of American crows 
make their exodus from the 
fields and forests of rural 
Washtenaw 
County 
and 

migrate to Ann Arbor for the 
winter. Their bodies create a 
black blanket spread across 
trees, historic buildings and 
anything else they can perch 
on. From the Huron River and 
Forest Hill Cemetery to North 
Campus, 
through 
Central 

Campus and the Diag, to 
the student houses on South 
Campus, the crows reign.

Their numbers fluctuate 

wildly from winter to winter. 
The 
National 
Audubon 

Society 
records 
nearly 

30,000 birds some years, and 
barely 1,000 in others (during 
their annual Christmas Bird 
Count), 
with 
population 

booms 
and 
crashes 
often 

occurring cyclically.

The 
2017 
count 
was 

relatively 
low 
at 
only 

3,133 crows, compared to 
the previous year’s 9,972. 
Though the 2018 Christmas 
Bird Count data is not yet 
available, it is safe to assume 
based 
on 
historical 
data 

and the opinions of anyone 
who 
walks 
along 
North 

University Street early in the 
morning that this year’s crow 
population is much higher.

Concern 
and 
interest 

surrounding these birds is 
nothing new. They have been 
the source of satire and news. 
In 1997, Cynthia Sims Parr, 
a 
University 
of 
Michigan 

alum and professor at the 
University of Maryland, wrote 
her doctoral dissertation on 
Ann Arbor’s crow population. 

Relations between humans 

and these avian neighbors 
have not always been kind. 
Crows are known to attack 

humans, particularly during 
nesting season. Though these 
attacks are rare, they are on 
the rise in many urban areas 
around the world. They are 
also thought to be vectors 
for the spread of diseases 
including West Nile virus and 
prion diseases.

Some 
blame 
crows 
for 

property damage, particularly 
to historic buildings. Others 
fear the eerie and foreboding 
atmosphere they create on 
long, unlit walks home late at 
night.

Some 
individuals 
have 

taken action into their own 
hands. These efforts have 
gone so far as to require 
Michigan’s 
Department 
of 

Natural Resources to send 
officials to Ann Arbor to 
investigate mass poisonings 

of birds in 2008 and 2009.

The 
University 
of 

Michigan has used a variety 
of methods over the years to 
attempt to deal with crows, 
including the use of a flare 
gun analog, none with any 
real degree of success.

Many 
other 
academic 

institutions 
face 
similar 

issues with large bothersome 
crow 
populations. 
Penn 

State 
University 
employs 

loud speakers and fireworks 
to 
scare 
crows 
off 
their 

campus, with limited and 
often short-lived success. At 
the University of Indiana-
Bloomington, 
students 

and faculty alike regularly 
attempt to dodge defecating 
crows as they walk across 
campus. The University of 
Pittsburgh 
uses 
speakers 

playing 
great 
horned 
owl 

calls to scare crows away 
from high-trafficked areas of 
campus. 

Airports and caretakers 

of 
historic 
government 

buildings have often taken 
a different approach: using 
falconers 
to 
scare 
away 

crows and other birds away 

from areas where they may 
cause harm. Unlike the use 
of speakers imitating birds of 
prey, having trained falcons, 
hawks, owls and other birds 
fly around has proven to be 
an effective way of dealing 
with this problem. While 
crows quickly realize that 
there are no predators when 
sound systems blare, they 
quickly fly from falconers, as 
they know death is imminent.

A 
more 
sustainable 

alternative 
to 
controlling 

the crow population would 
be 
actively 
aiding 
the 

rehabilitation 
of 
native 

populations of birds of prey. 
In 
recent 
years 
breeding 

peregrine 
falcons 
have 

started to move into areas 
by both Central and the 
Medical Campus. This could 
in part explain why the crow 
population’s peaks no longer 
reached the heights they used 
to. A potential side effect to 
increasing the local number 
of birds of prey, however, 
is that our campus’ beloved 
obese squirrels may turn into 
easy snacks for them.

LSA Student Government 

and 
Engineering 
Student 

Government 
passed 

resolutions in winter 2016 
asking the City of Ann Arbor 
to investigate the issue of 
crow populations on and near 
campus. The Central Student 
Government also discussed 
the 
matter 
that 
semester. 

However, as far as is publicly 
known, no action has come 
following those initial efforts.

The way the city and the 

University choose to address 
this issue sets a tone and 
spirit for how to address other 
issues 
pertaining 
to 
local 

wildlife, the environment and 
the community at large.

To not address it establishes 

a laissez-faire attitude toward 
this and other similar issues. 
To 
use 
non-sustainable 

methods 
would 
signal 
an 

adversarial relationship with 
the 
environment 
at 
large. 

To use sustainable methods 
would signal a willingness 
to find long term solutions to 
issues that work in harmony 
with the environment, rather 
than against it.

Why paying people for their data isn’t empowering
L

ast week we learned that 

Facebook and Google 

have been paying people 

for access to almost 

all 
their 
personal 

data. Both companies 

employed 
research 

programs that paid 

participants 
as 

young as 13 years old 

up to $20 per month 

for access to their 

private 
messages, 

photos, emails, web 

history and location 

data. 
Facebook 

also 
requested 

screenshots 
of 
participants’ 

Amazon shopping history.

I’m 
not 
shocked. 
That 

would 
be 
naive. 
Programs 

like these are the obvious 

next step in our data hungry 

world. A number of startups 

have emerged promising to 

empower individuals to “own 

their own data” and connect 

them with organizations who 

want to pay for it.

Often 
data 
monetization 

proponents justify the practice 

by portraying it as a choice. 

For example, Facebook has 

defended 
their 
program, 

saying users were aware of 

what 
they 
were 
gathering 

and 
compensated 
for 
their 

participation. 
Essentially, 

Facebook argues participants 

made an informed choice to 

hand 
over 
intimate 
details 

about their private lives for 

$20 per month.

The 
problem 
with 

the 
choice 
argument 
is 

that 
without 
protections 

for 
individuals 
and 
clear 

enumerations of the rights they 

possess, there may be no real 

choice at all. Users frequently 

don’t understand what they are 

agreeing to when they hand 

over data and the pressure of 

potential compensation may 

influence people’s decisions. 

Furthermore, 
who 
enforces 

this exchange? Who ensures 

your data is being used as 

promised? What sort of rights 

do 
you 
have 
to 

dictate how your 

data is used and if 

it is resold? Should 

certain 
types 
of 

data 
never 
be 

for sale? We lack 

the 
regulatory 

frameworks 

necessary to even 

begin 
answering 

these questions.

If pay for data 

programs 
are 

allowed 
to 
run 
unchecked, 

there could soon be two worlds 

of technology use: one for the 

rich and one for everyone else. 

The rich will be able to resist 

the extra flow of money — a 

little additional cash won’t 

be enough to convince them 

to let companies into their 

private lives. The same won’t 

be true for everyone else. As 

much of the world loses any 

sense of privacy, the privileged 

will enjoy the benefits. Better 

voice assistants, more relevant 

recommendations, and quicker 

commutes – all built on the 

personal data of the masses. 

Companies will profit from 

unprecedented 
targeted 
ad 

opportunities. Without steps 

to ensure privacy is a right 

instead of a privilege, the gap 

between the rich and poor will 

widen further.

To 
avoid 
the 
dystopian 

future presented above, the 

U.S. should codify the data 

rights that individuals possess 

and implement a regulatory-

enforcement 
system 
to 

uphold 
those 
rights. 
Only 

after 
that 
can 
individuals 

represent 
themselves 
fairly 

in 
any 
data 
monetization 

interaction. Outlawing pay for 

data programs isn’t realistic 

or 
necessarily 
desirable, 

but we can help ensure the 

exchange 
is 
fair 
by 
truly 

empowering individuals with 

privacy 
standards 
in 
their 

best 
interests 
and 
holding 

companies 
accountable 
for 

unethical practices.

The ideal system is one in 

which 
procedures 
involving 

personal data are similar to 

the current procedures for 

research on human subjects. In 

research with human subjects, 

participants 
must 
clearly 

understand the process and 

its 
potential 
consequences. 

Additionally, 
research 
is 

audited by an Institutional 

Review Board charged with 

protecting the welfare, rights 

and privacy of human subjects.

If a similar system was 

implemented 
for 
the 
data 

economy, we could preserve 

innovation 
while 
protecting 

individuals. 
Your 
level 

of 
privacy 
would 
not 
be 

determined by your level of 

privilege, and you could make 

true, informed choices about 

when you give up that privacy. 

Companies would still have 

avenues to collect valuable 

data, but we could ensure 

citizens are not manipulated 

for 
intrusive 
digital 

experimentation.

Empowering 
individuals 

to control their data is a 

noble cause, but monetization 

without 
a 
general 
privacy 

framework 
may 
have 
dire 

consequences. Without proper 

protections, 
the 
vulnerable 

may be exploited under the 

guise of free will — pigeonholed 

into transforming their most 

personal 
information 
into 

fuel for the digital revolution. 

Monetization may be a useful 

tool someday, but before we 

answer basic questions about 

data privacy, it’s a harmful 

mirage.

NICHOLAS FADANELLI | OP-ED

The perennial invasion of crows

I

n the midst of the Syrian 
refugee crisis, I watched 
helplessly 
as 
my 
aunt 

and three cousins escaped the 
turmoil and violence of our 
motherland in small plastic boats. 
They braved the unknown of 
the Mediterranean Sea on their 
journey to freedom, to only later 
continue on this journey with 
weeks of smuggling starting from 
Greece to their final destination of 
Germany.

Months later, I sat on the floor 

of Chicago O’Hare International 
Airport for hours, awaiting the 
arrival of my other Syrian aunt 
who was later detained and 
unlawfully sent back as Trump’s 
infamous “Muslim Ban” was 
signed while her flight was in the 
air.

While the countless stories I 

heard and heartbreak I saw from 
family, friends or the media were 
dismaying, these events in my 
own family were my personal 
turning 
point 
in 
rethinking 

the U.S. approach to Syria. As 
the daughter of two Syrian 
immigrants, 
I 
learned 
about 

American politics through the 
broken U.S. immigration system. 
Who is it that fills these gaps or 
fixes the flaws that were evident 
in the policies that dictated the 
entirety of my family’s structure?

Growing 
up 
as 
a 
Syrian 

American, especially as a first-
generation American, it’s often 
hard to take a genuine interest 
in a system that you feel is pitted 
against you and your family. My 
parents instilled in me a desire 
to not only utilize my voice by 
being an active citizen, but also 
to simply care about politics. My 
concern stems from my familial 
attachment to the issue, but 
the segment of the American 
population that claims to care 
about Syria and the refugee crisis 
needs to show it.

As we near the 2020 presidential 

election, the evaluation of the 
candidates becomes especially 
pertinent. 
Syria 
and 
its 

humanitarian crisis has been a hot 
button issue for many progressive, 
liberal-leaning individuals. While 
care and compassion are essential 
and the first step in providing 
valuable institution-wide change, 
such energy must be matched 
with effective political actions.

Since President Barack Obama’s 

admission of regret towards his 
inaction in Syria, it has become 
evident that the United States 
— specifically its commander-in-
chief — cannot stay silent over 
such humanitarian crises. Many of 
the 2020 Democratic candidates, 
including Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. 
Kamala Harris and Sen. Elizabeth 
Warren have emphasized their 
desire to withdraw from Syria as 
Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad 
continues 
to 
commit 
mass 

genocide on the Syrian people. As 
a leading world power, the United 
States 
faces 
a 
responsibility 

to support and advocate for 
humanitarian efforts.

U.S. 
Rep. 
Tulsi 
Gabbard, 

D-Hawaii, recently announced 
her run for the 2020 Democratic 
nomination. 
Gabbard 
is 

infamously known for going to 
Syria meet with Bashar al-Assad, 
claiming that she was “skeptical” 
over his involvement in deadly 
chemical 
attacks 
on 
Syrian 

civilians and that there are “a 
number of theories” over what is 
going on in Syria.

Gabbard followed her meeting 

with the introduction of her “Stop 
Arming Terrorists” Act. After 
dehumanizing 
the 
atrocities 

occurring 
against 
innocent 

civilians as simply a matter of 
al-Assad’s secularist government 
versus Islamic State rebels, she 
urged Congress to stop using 
taxpayer money, both directly and 
indirectly, to fund groups allied 
with 
terrorists 
organizations 

attempting to overthrow the 
Syrian government.

The deaths of real people, the 

life-threatening escape of my own 
family members — and millions 
like them — is not an issue of 
theories or speculation. Gabbard’s 
blatant ignorance characterizing 
the humanitarian crisis in Syria 
as a mere bilateral issue becomes 
increasingly alarming to Syrian 
Americans like myself who are 
watching the erasure of the 
realities of the war crimes being 
committed daily in Syria. And 
because 
these politicians are 

not alone in their indifference to 
Syria, I feel my fears of the world 
forgetting about Syria becoming a 
palpable reality.

While 
Democrats 
and 

Republicans 
alike 
continue 

to express their views on the 
refugee crisis — whether for or 
against increasing the number of 
immigrants Trump allows into 
the U.S. — the reality is that this 
problem stems from a need to fix 
issues on a systematic level within 
Syria.

Whether we look at Germany 

as a model for their refugee 
integration system or remodel 
our own current system, the 
concern on a presidential level 
for action in Syria is vital to fixing 
this humanitarian issue. As we 
move closer to the heated 2020 
presidential race, it is crucial to 
question the rhetoric on Syria that 
these candidates are expressing. If 
we, as Americans, want to continue 
having an opinion on the refugee 
crisis, we must also have an opinion 
on Syria and our country’s role in 
combatting oppression.

Valentine’s Day music for lovers and loners

SHERRY CHEN / DAILY

The day is nigh. Valentine’s day, Saint Valentine’s Day, the 
Feast of the Valentine, “Valentimes” Day, V-Day — regardless 
of its many iterations, February 14th is both interpersonally 
and commercially accepted as the day of love. Unfortunately, 
love, in the romanticized context of this holiday we’re 
addressing, seems to carry binary implications — you’re either 
in it, or you’re out of it. In other words, on this day you could 
be feeling wholly in love, embracing the pinks and reds and 
boxes of chocolates, or you could be feeling incredibly alone, 
torn between your desire for affection and your reasonable 
distaste for everything Valentine-related. With these 
possibilities in mind, we’ve curated a list of albums you should 
listen to if you’re feeling either of these two ways today.
Disclaimer: We realize such a list might inappropriately 
categorize and glorify varying sentiments regarding love and 
loneliness — forgive us as we submit to the rigid interpretations 
of these ideas that Valentine’s Day necessitates.

‘The 
Essential 
Dean 
Martin’ — Dean Martin

A 
Valentine’s 
Day 
lineup 
without mention of Dean Martin 
and his classic hit, “That’s 
Amore?”
That would be a crime against 
love.
Luckily, such a misstep is 
quickly remedied. So, in the name 
of “true love,” romance and good 
taste, this writer humbly suggests 
Dean 
Martin’s 
2014 
album 
compilation, The Essential Dean 
Martin, as a necessary addition to 
any playlist this Valentine’s Day.
And really, who does love 
better than Dean Martin? He 
even made pizza synonymous 
with romance, “When the moon 
hits your eye like a big pizza pie / 
That’s amore.”
With the unyielding winter 
blast 
Ann 
Arbor 
has 
been 
subjected to of late, Martin’s 
light-hearted 
forays 
through 
love will put anyone in the mood 
for romance. With songs like 
“Tik-A-Tee, Tik-A-Tay,” “That’s 
Amore,” and “Volare,” Martin 
reminds the world that romance, 
and Valentine’s Day, is meant to 
be fun. Even at his most serious 
in sappy-ballads like “Everybody 
Loves Somebody” and “You’re 
Nobody Till Somebody Loves 
You,” 
nothing 
feels 
heavy 
or 
overdone. 
Every 
one 
of 
Martin’s songs celebrates love 
— even heartache — without the 
heaviness of many love songs. 
Martin’s songs are, at their core, 
full of hope and lightness.
The Essential Dean Martin 
album has, as the title implies, 
some of Martin’s most beloved 
hits. And now, decades later, 
Martin’s music still maintains its 
timeless relevance and beauty.
Valentine’s Day isn’t only about 
romantic love — it’s also about the 
relationships and connections 
between all kinds of people. It 
can be a celebration of love as a 
whole, beyond a mere consumer 
holiday, if you only let it. And no 
one captures this sentiment as 
well as Martin does in song.
As Dean Martin eloquently 
croons in “Everybody Loves 
Somebody,”
“Your love made it well worth 
waiting / For someone, like you.”

‘The Miseducation of 
Lauryn Hill’ — Lauryn Hill

Whatever your opinion of her 
as a person may be, Lauryn Hill 
is an undeniable musical genius. 
Her work with the neo-soul 
group The Fugees cemented this 
in the pop sphere, but her 1998 
debut album The Miseducation 
of Lauryn Hill was the nail in 
the coffin that thrust her to true 
critical acclaim. It is a record 
that fundamentally understands 
human nature: the ups and downs 
of life, sadness and joy, and, of 
course, the inner workings of the 
thing we call love. Miseducation 
shows the possibilities of what 
love can be, in all of its forms. And 
for that, I believe that the record 
is the perfect Valentine’s Day 
soundtrack.
There is a misunderstanding 
across the board that truly great 
love songs are just about romantic 
relationships. Hill challenges this 
immediately, singing the praises 
of her love for her child (“To 
Zion”), for the city in which she 
grew up (“Every Ghetto, Every 
City”), and to the world in general 
(“Everything is Everything”). 
These songs are almost more 
profound than the traditionally 
sappy proclamations of love that 

listeners may be used to, but Hill 
even gives that format new legs 
on tracks like the classic break-
up jam “Ex-Factor” and “Nothing 
Even Matters,” a duet which 
features similarly talented artist 
D’Angelo.
But the thing that really drives 
the 
genius 
of 
Miseducation 
home is its interludes. The 
short vignettes into a classroom 
setting show listeners love from 
a child’s perspective, as their 
teacher asks them questions. 
These visions into the minds of 
children show the way that our 
views of love change throughout 
our lives, shifting from a feeling 
to a choice and back again. In 
their young voices, the listener 
is able to hear what it’s like to 
have never been in love, to have 
never been wronged or confused 
by it. Their perspectives balance 
Hill’s in a perfect combination 
of innocence and understanding, 
one that brings Miseducation 
to an emotional peak. In this 
interplay between the two sides 
of love, the record proves that it 
is, at its foundation, anything you 
want it to be.

‘Foxy Shazam’ — Foxy 
Shazam

Foxy Shazam is an unlikely 
anthem for the not-lonely.
If you were to read the lyrics 
and guess what this album 
sounded like, you think of 
“dark,” “depressing” or even 
“lonely.” But just a few minutes 
into the record and it’s clear 
those words couldn’t be further 
from the truth. Foxy Shazam 
is oozing with excitement, and 
vocalist Eric Nally delivers his 
insecure lyrics with unmatched 
confidence.
There’s a paradox in the social 
landscape of young people today: 
We are attracted to confidence, 
but find comfort in a shared sense 
of anxiety. We are socialites that 
constantly over-share our daily 
lives, but the foundation of our 
humor is self-deprecation. We 
feel lonely, but that loneliness 
brings us together. Foxy Shazam 
is the musical manifestation of 
this paradox. It’s a bundle of 
worry and fear dressed in passion 
and charisma — a dress that life 
demands we wear when we feel 
worried and afraid. Foxy Shazam 
wears it well, with orchestral 
flair that might be the musical 
equivalent to makeup and high 
heels.
Relatability unites listeners 
on this album, making it a record 
best enjoyed with company. 
“Count Me Out” is lyrically a 
dreary outlook on love, but the 
chorus — “If this is what love is 
all about / You can count me out” 
— is not meant to be sang alone. 
Nor is the rebellious chant, “We 
are unstoppable / No, we can’t 
be defeated,” on “Unstoppable.” 
“Wanna-Be Angel” might be the 
album’s most relatable track, 
admitting the different faces 
we put on for others are in fact 
just masks. The album’s themes 
strike close to home for many.
There are songs for everyone 
on Foxy Shazam, and by that I 
mean this album is literally for 
everyone. It’s an album for the 
people, a grandiose celebration 
of 
our 
insecurity. 
So 
this 
Valentine’s Day, whether you and 
your Tinder date both had self-
deprecating jokes in your bios, or 
you and your single friends just 
need to jam, do it to the tune of 
Foxy Shazam.

‘Modal Soul’ — Nujabes

If you are lucky enough to not 
be lonely this Valentine’s Day, you 
might be looking for some music to 
soundtrack your experience. If so, 
Modal Soul, an album of jazz-hop, 
dreamy dance music, and soulful 
soundscapes, is for you. Released 
in 2005 by the late Nujabes, it 
manages to not sound dated in 
the slightest after almost 15 years. 
His ability to make the artificial 
feel even more real and profound 
than the natural is matched only 
by J Dilla: “Reflection Eternal” 
possesses this quality, fractured but 
smooth and organic. “Luv Sic Pt. 3” 
is a nonpareil hip-hop masterpiece, 
capturing the highs and lows of 
love in a way that has the genre has 
yet to match.
Nujabes 
is 
the 
producer, 
relying upon a collection of guests 
to deliver verses over the non-
instrumental tracks. The guest 
verses, while varying in quality, feel 
like a collection of vignettes; they 
are all the more impactful for their 
slightly-amateurish feeling.
When you listen to Modal Soul, 
you cannot help but be reminded of 
the hidden beauty in our world that 
is all too easy to overlook. It is an 
album for appreciating where you 
are in life — right here, right now. 
It is profoundly soulful, somehow 
colored in a way that makes it feel 
like its own universe. It carries the 
same feeling of being out-of-place, 
the feeling that there is nothing 
that could possibly more important 
than your current experience, 
brought by being with someone you 
care deeply about.

‘I Want You’ — Marvin 
Gaye

There are albums about sex and 
then there’s Marvin Gaye’s I Want 
You. Ripe with provocation as jazz 
interludes slowly drip down the 
back of smoothly upbeat melodies, 
Gaye’s voice is sticky sweet on top 
of it all — the album is commonly 
referred to as the “Janis” record, 
a testament to all the passion 
Gaye had for his wife. It is nearly 
impossible to listen to this album 
and not feel its heat. “I can’t wait 
to touch you / Give you that feeling 
/ Eat you up my dear,” he says in 
“Soon I’ll Be Loving You Again” 
with an unabashed yearning that 
burns.
I Want You was the first project 
recorded in Gaye’s personally 
designed studio space, and its 
creation was a largely social 
affair. Surrounded by important 
memorabilia and family members 
who would drop in and out, 
the recording process became 
as intimate as the album itself, 
personability and warmth infusing 
themselves into the notes. I Want 
You isn’t meant to be listened to 
when one feels especially lonely. 
In order to fully understand 
the album’s impact, one has to 
embrace 
the 
love 
manifested 
in every honeyed croon and in 
every languid melody. One has to 
imagine serenading the person 
they love most as Gaye oftentimes 
did, turning to sing lyrics directly 
to Janis, both of them oftentimes 
running to the apartment complex 
resting above the studio in order to 
“express some of the passion [Gaye] 
was putting down on the record in 
real time.”

‘Lovely Little Lonely’ — 
The Maine

I’m going to be blunt here: 
The Maine deserve so, so much 
better. The 1975 are out here 
writing bullshit pseudo-romantic 
reflections 
about 
the 
fucking 
internet netting them headlining 
positions on festivals, while The 
Maine, albeit still selling out decent 
sized rooms, maybe receive half 
the recognition. It’s infuriating 
because The Maine released a 
record in 2017 that is an absolutely 
(and 
objectively!) 
flawless 
examination of love and loneliness. 
That record is Lovely Little Lonely, 
a perfect balancing of the lovely 
and the lonely in relationships.
On opener “Don’t Come Down,” 
the band expertly sets the album’s 
tone with a pre-chorus declaring, 
“To the lows and every high / 
The hellos and the goodbyes / 
In this moment, I could die with 
you.” The highs are here, intricate 
portraits of intimacy, but the lows 
are bitingly universal. “Do You 
Remember? (The Other Half of 
23)” almost sneaks by as one of the 
highs before you first hear vocalist 
John O’Callaghan declare, “We 
said forever / forever ago / Do you 
remember?” Ouch.
Because this is an album 
largely focused on nostalgia, I 
figured Lovely Little Lonely leans 
a little more into the “lonely” 
category here, but if anything, it’s 
an album about love. Love in all 
of its forms — intimacy, perfect 
memories, a failure of words to 
even accurately capture love. Most 
of all, The Maine have captured 
the uncertainty of love, constantly 
questioning our emotions, but 
always asserting their validity: 
“To all the dearly depressed and 
broken hearted / The in-betweens 
and all the torn ones too / You’re 
not alone in how you’re feeling / I 
wonder why nobody is asking you.”
What a perfectly lovely and 
perfectly lonely mess we’ve gotten 
ourselves into by being human.

‘Donuts’ — J Dilla

Hip 
hop 
typically 
isn’t 
considered a solitary genre. On 
any given song, a rapper might 
work with a number of other 
rappers, producers and engineers. 
The process takes an entire team 
to manufacture radio smash-hits 
and underground classics, so it is 
unique when artists create entire 
albums by themselves. J Dilla was 
one of these unique artists.
J Dilla, the man behind songs 
like “Runnin” by The Pharcyde and 
“Stakes is High” by De La Soul, was 
a prolific producer (and occasional 
rapper), claimed by many to be 
the most influential producers of 
all time. Dilla beats have a certain 
air about them. It’s almost like 
they have a soul, like they live and 
breathe to fit each listener.
In an interview with Amoeba 
Records, The Red Hot Chili 
Peppers’s Flea said J Dilla’s Ruff 
Draft brought tears to his eyes when 
he listened to the album walking 
through Big Sur by himself. This 
is noteworthy because Ruff Draft, 
typically considered to be buoyant, 
almost goofy album, affected Flea 
in such a way that he was reduced 
to tears. This same sentiment could 
be applied to any of Dilla’s albums 
because J Dilla was able to give his 
music a sound that was uniquely 
his, a sound that all listeners could 
appreciate in their own way.
During the creation of Donuts, 
Dilla was on his deathbed. He was 
alone in the sense that only he knew 
the struggles he was enduring. 
While he was in the hospital, all 

he had was his sampler, record 
player and himself. He translated 
his solitary struggle into an album, 
something that everyone could 
understand.
Because the entire album is 
looped, listeners can begin at 
any song and have their own 
experience with Donuts, based on 
how they prefer to listen to it. By 
the time the album is complete, 
they will be right back where 
they started, having heard the 
beauty that came from the tragedy 
of Dilla’s struggle. This is why 
Donuts, Ruff Draft and all of Dilla’s 
work should be listened to alone. 
Without a team, J Dilla had the 
freedom to put exactly what he 
envisioned into practice. His songs 
were crafted by him alone and 
made for people to listen to alone, 
so they may experience the same 
catharsis he did.

‘Geidi Primes’ — Grimes

I spent a lot of winter break 
driving. At the time, my parents had 
just moved to a small city right off 
the edge of the freeway. In the gray 
monochrome of late-December 
Michigan skies, the unfinished 
neighborhoods 
and 
gnarled, 
marshy terrain surrounding my 
new home were sacred and ghostly 
things. They were unfamiliar to 
me, and I to them, so I found myself 
behind the wheel more days than 
not, alone and letting my mind 
wander, in order to try to establish 
some kind of recognition with the 
streets around me. The only album 
that seemed appropriate to listen 
to in those quiet moments of self-
reflection in my car, as landmarks 
I didn’t acknowledge flickered by, 
was Grimes’s debut album, Geidi 
Primes.
Armed with warped melodies 
and spectral falsettos, Geidi Primes 
exudes an almost otherworldly air 
of menace. Take opener “Caladan,” 
piano chords rippling out like an 
unstoppable flood into the airy 
manifestation of the lyrics: “We all 
haunt in the sky at night.” It reads 
as a premonition for the rest of the 
album, as stark and transcendental 
as the surface of the moon. 
There is not a single component 
of Geidi Primes that doesn’t 
embody some type of loneliness. 
Guitar 
chords 
carefully 
pick 
their way through a mist of of 
disembodied string melodies like 
long-legged cranes. Synths splay 
out like stars in the night sky, 
hundreds upon hundreds of light 
years away. Vocals are as formless 
and as distant as the clouds that 
etch themselves across the sky 
at sundown. “Where are you 
my darling?” she asks in “Venus 
in Fleurs,” voice as solemn as a 
funeral procession, layered chords 
rattling bare like tree branches 
standing with stooped shoulders 
against roads that will never be 
familiar enough.

‘Blonde’ — Frank Ocean

Frank Ocean curated Blonde 
in a hefty bout of self-exile, 
his response to a public that 
demanded more following Channel 
Orange. This is fitting; the album 
encapsulates a variety of emotions 
across time, never consistently 
content 
or 
misanthropic, 
not 
even in-between. It defies genre 
classification as a seamless blend of 
bare instrumentals, wispy techno-
touched vocals and fragmented 
commentary. It finds cohesion 
in such deconstructive energies. 
This is down to the very title of 
the album, Blonde, appearing 

as “Blond” on the album cover, 
eschewing any specifications of 
gender or sexuuality. The helium-
infused intro track “Nikes” echoes 
such a sentiment, Ocean hinting “I 
got two versions” before the vocals 
deepen for the outro.
Thematically, this album is 
about social isolation. It follows 
heartbreak, set backs, failure and 
confusion with an inscrutable, 
shaky 
lens, 
never 
distinctly 
melancholic or wistful. Blonde is 
an effortless confusion where one 
can finally recognize their failed 
interactions with others. You’re 
seen “like a UFO,” and feel that 
“it’s quite alright to hate me now.” 
During “Nights,” the heart of the 
album, a beat switch-up at the 
midpoint of the album’s runtime 
reinforces the theme of duality; 
Ocean is notably more melancholic 
here, more straightforward. He’ll 
tell people “shut the fuck up I 
don’t want your conversation” 
and that he’s unapologetically “so 
low” and “dancing by myself.” But 
he’s still confused with aspects of 
his life — whether he’ll settle into 
expectations of bisexual erasure 
as discussed in “Seigfried,” or how 
the bond between him and a lover 
will unfold once it’s over in “White 
Ferrari.”
Blonde soundtracks loneliness 
in its self-awareness, its ability 
to dig into the complexity of 
feeling lonely beyond the desire 
to connect with others. It tears 
down the barriers we create for 
ourselves by delving into a zone 
of self exploration rather than 
forcing classifications or blaming 
anyone or anything.

‘Sgt. 
Pepper’s 
Lonely 
Hearts Club Band’ — The 
Beatles

It’s admittedly very difficult 
to write about what is widely 
considered the greatest album of 
all time, but I’m going to attempt 
to do so anyway. The Beatles’ 
magnum opus Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely 
Hearts Club Band is precisely 
what you’d expect from its title 
— a strange, carefree adventure 
orchestrated 
by 
a 
fantastical 
version of the most popular group 
of best friends ever. What better 
cure for loneliness than a great set 
of friends?
While only three tracks on the 
album are principley tied to this 
Lonely Hearts gimmick, the band 
members still manage to curate 
a magical landscape through 
which they grant you a tour: John 
brings you to an acid-ridden circus 
act on “Being For The Benefit 
of Mr. Kite!” George invites 
you to embrace introspection 
and the divine on “Within You 
Without You” and Paul brings it 
all back down to earth with the 
lighthearted “When I’m Sixty-
Four.” 
The album strikes the perfect 
balance between goofy, relatable, 
intellectual and self-aware — 
characteristics that would make 
for a group of friends primed to 
make the lonelies disappear. When 
the final chord of “A Day In The 
Life” strikes, a strange feeling of 
comfort and disbelief settles in, as 
if you’d just touched down in reality 
after a magnificent adventure 
through the other-wordly and 
magical realm of the Beatles at 
their most complementary and 
psychedelic.

A year ago, Melody Herzfeld 
was 
leading 
rehearsals 
for 
Marjory 
Stoneman 
Douglas 
High School’s annual children’s 
musical when a shooter opened 
fire in the building and the 
alarms went off. Thinking it 
was a run-of-the-mill fire drill, 
her 65 students trudged outside 
before Herzfeld realized it was 
something more and herded 
them back in to take 
shelter 
in 
a 
storage 
closet. They waited there 
for two hours before 
authorities took them to 
safety.
What is it they say in 
the 
theater 
business? 
The show must go on. 
And so it did, though the 
production, a sweet adventure 
tale called “Yo, Vikings!”, was 
postponed by a few months. 
“Song of Parkland,” a half-
hour documentary from HBO, 
follows 
Herzfeld 
and 
her 
students in the aftermath of the 
Parkland shooting as they head 
back to rehearsals and grapple 
with the awful tragedy that 
befell their community.
That there is healing power 
in art and song is probably 
not news to anyone. And it’s 
pointed out several times over 

the half hour. But “Song of 
Parkland” is more than that: 
It’s an ode to everything that’s 
special 
about 
high 
school 
drama programs, those joyful, 
formative, underfunded spaces. 
In the theater, one student says, 
“we don’t have to worry about 
being judged or worry about 
what people are going to think 
because this is our safe place.”
“Song of Parkland” makes 
the case that experience in the 
performing arts department — 
where students are regularly 

encouraged to find their voices 
— has been foundational to the 
activism that emerged from the 
school’s students. “My same 
kids that are my theater kids 
are out there doing speeches 
all over the place, those are my 
kids too,” Herzfeld says.

Herzfeld is warm and poised 
— in a sense, she’s the drama 
teacher we all had. If there’s a 
common thread throughout the 
documentary, it’s her. But the 
big flaw of “Song of Parkland” is 

that it’s never quite clear what 
the documentary is about. Is 
it about Herzfeld? The drama 
department? Student activism? 
Amy Schatz, the film’s director, 
relies on the abundance of 
footage and news clips from 
the shooting’s aftermath. But 
her product suffers from a 
loose, meandering directorial 
hand. At so many points, “Song 
of Parkland” would benefit 
from additional editing and 
direction.
The 
documentary 
ends 
at 
last 
summer’s 
Tony 
Awards, 
where 
Stoneman 
Douglas 
students 
performed 
“Seasons of Love” to 
a moved audience. It’s 
an easy, expected place 
to conclude the story, 
the students now on a 
grand stage. But it’s a 
little disappointing that “Song 
of Parkland” has let us become 
invested 
in 
the 
small 
but 
cathartic Viking musical only to 
shift gears altogether.
But it still leaves off on a 
moving note, a speech Herzfeld 
makes 
when 
accepting 
an 
Excellence in Theater Education 
Award at the ceremony: “We all 
have a common energy. We all 
want the same thing, we cannot 
deny it. To be heard, to hit our 
mark, to tell our truth, to make 
a difference.”

‘Song of Parkland’ is at 
once moving, inconsistent

‘Song of Parkland’

HBO

Now streaming

Hedy Lamarr had the kind 
of life that, at first glance, 
sounds too dramatic, terrifying 
and glamorous to be real. Her 
biography reads like the plot of an 
old fashioned noir movie — born in 
Austria in 1914 at the cusp of World 
War I, married to an arms dealer 
with Nazi ties at the age 
of 18, she defected from 
the Nazis, fled to America, 
became a Golden Era of 
Hollywood movie siren 
and invented a frequency 
hopping signal system 
patented by the US Navy 
during World War II.
And 
yet, 
despite 
absolutely 
being 
one 
of the most interesting 
people to have lived in 
the past century, Lamarr 
is decidedly not a household 
name. In “The Only Woman in 
the Room,” author Marie Benedict 
attempts to bring Lamarr’s story 
to the popular consciousness by 
novelizing it in lurid first person 
detail.
Writing 
novels 
about 
historically overlooked women 
from their perspective is a well 
worn method, from 2013’s “Z: 
A Story of Zelda Fitzgerald” 
to Benedict’s own “The Other 
Einstein.” It’s a clever way of 
centering the women who have for 
so long been sidelined, but it runs 
similar risks to Hollywood biopics. 
Rather than telling an organic 
story 
or 
understanding 
what 
exactly were the most important 

turning points in these women’s 
lives, the narratives are usually 
predicated on events the readers 
are already familiar with. If you 
took the screenplay of the most 
bluntly written, unsubtle biopic — 
a “Bohemian Rhapsody” or “On 
The Basis of Sex” — and combined 
it with Hedy Lamarr’s Wikipedia 
page, the result would be “The 
Only Woman in the Room.” We 
follow story beats we already 

know, and the readers get to feel 
superior because we know what’s 
about to happen when our narrator 
says things like, “Austria became a 
fascist state not only in practice but 
in name. I clung to Papa’s words 
that it was a technical change 
only and what mattered was the 
government’s ongoing dedication 
to keep Nazi Germany at bay.”
Fascism aside, the novel is an 
entertaining, easy read, but it 
seems unsure of what exactly it 
wants to be. “The Only Woman 
in the Room” is stuck between 
being 
an 
actual 
novel 
that 
illustrates 
characters’ 
interior 
lives and creates emotional stakes 
and a biography that draws a 
straightforward and clear line 

between discrete live events. It’s 
ostensibly from the perspective of 
Lamarr, but even though she was a 
real person, the novel does little to 
illustrate just who that person was. 
There are a lot of qualities we come 
to understand about Lamarr: her 
savantlike intuition for seduction, 
her ability to manipulate others’ 
perception of her, her tenacity, 
her ability to survive abuse. But 
Benedict’s writing does nothing to 
bring us into Lamarr’s 
world — we’re told these 
are qualities she has, 
and we watch her do 
things and see things. 
The prose holds her at a 
distance, and the result 
is a book chock full of 
war, sex, love, death, 
pain 
and 
glamour 
landing entirely flat on 
an emotional level.
This 
is 
where 
“The 
Only 
Woman 
in the Room” really commits 
the 
unforgivable 
sin 
in 
the 
“fictionalized 
account 
of 
underrepresented 
historical 
women” 
genre. 
The 
whole 
purpose is to make the reader 
empathize with the figure, to 
make people fully aware not only 
of the woman’s underappreciated 
accomplishments, 
but 
of 
her 
personhood. “The Only Woman” 
certainly lists a detailed account of 
Lamarr’s achievements, but it does 
little to expand on Lamarr as a 
person, on her desires and dreams 
and heart.

BOOK REVIEW

As 
I 
walked 
up 
to 
the 
Kerrytown Concert House, I 
double-checked my phone to 
make sure I was in the right 
place for the Tad Weed Jazz 
Master Series: Tribute to Ron 
Brooks. The sign in front told me 
I had arrived, so I walked up to 
the front door of what was most 
certainly a house, and restrained 
myself from knocking. Poking 
my head through the door, I 
found that the interior was set 
up with a bunch of chairs in 
multiple different rooms, all 
facing a well lit stage. And on my 
right, a kitchen. Yep, definitely a 
house.
I 
settled 
in, 
adapting 
to 
my surroundings. The people 
around me greeted each other, all 
seeming to know each other from 
similar experiences. At around 
20 years younger than almost 
everyone in the room, I was not 
a part of that community. But I 
smiled to myself while flipping 
through the program, enjoying 
the atmosphere of camaraderie 
in what was certainly a house but 
also seemed to be a home.
Soon, the first three performers 
— pianist Rick Roe, bassist Kurt 
Krahnke and drummer Sean 
Dobbins — entered the living 
room and made their way to the 

stage. They shook hands with 
the people in the front row, even 
giving some of them hugs. There 
was a general air of community. 
Then Roe counted them off, and 
on they went. In a flurry of well-
rehearsed invention, the group 
displayed their mastery of the 
instruments and of cohesion. 
Exchanging smiles and glances, 
they soared through tune after 
tune, barely stopping for a 
breath.
About halfway through the 
show, the band ceased their 
incredible medley, and Dobbins 
addressed 
the 
audience 
for 
the first time, inviting Ron 
Brooks, the father of Ann Arbor 
jazz, to the stage. Giving a 
brief introduction for the man 
everyone in the audience already 
seemed to know, they then began 
another set of songs with the 
legendary bassist at their side. 
Brooks welcomed the crowd into 
the performance, smiling with 
them, laughing with them, even 
singing along to his instrument. 
The music was a perfect blend 
of familiarity yet inventiveness, 
nostalgia yet passion — it made 
you want to cry and dance at the 
same time. The music perfectly 
encapsulated the venue: intimate 
with an air of excitement.
The concert concluded with 
a Q&A for Brooks in which he 
described his time in Ann Arbor. 
He opened the first jazz club 

in Ann Arbor, called The Bird 
of Paradise, hosting numerous 
soon-to-be jazz stars, from the 
Count Basie Orchestra to Dizzy 
Gillespie. He said his goal was to 
give jazz to the next generation, 
and 
he 
succeeded. 
Dobbins 
admitted to missing many first 
hours due to his frequent visits 
to the club when he was in 
high school. And now he’s an 
accomplished drummer playing 
with the very musicians who 
inspired him in the first place.
The Brooks Tribute Concert 
not 
only 
introduced 
some 
truly 
incredible 
jazz 
music, 
but it also revealed a legacy in 
Ann Arbor. This community, 
audience 
members 
and 
jazz 
artists alike, have all found a 
home in music, and a lot of that 
is thanks to Brooks. During his 
time in Ann Arbor and at The 
Bird of Paradise, Brooks fostered 
a community musicians and 
music lovers, and formed lasting 
bonds with that community. The 
Kerrytown Concert House not 
only displayed this community 
beautifully, but conveyed the 
home jazz found within their 
very own house. Ann Arbor jazz 
has a rich history and a thriving 
community even today. As long 
as the new generation finds their 
place in jazz, or the Kerrytown 
Concert House, the community 
will never die and the music will 
never stop.

Matthews provides blueprint for 
Michigan to get back on track

Charles 
Matthews 
stood 
outside the away locker room 
at the Bryce Jordan Center, 
surrounded by a swarm of 
reporters. Coming off a Big 
Ten 
career-high 
24-point 
performance — a continuation 
of the redshirt junior’s most 
impressive stretch in months — 
it was a logical scene.
This time, though, Matthews’ 
showing came with the caveat 
that Michigan had just fallen 
75-69 to the conference’s hapless 
doormat. So, amidst a run of 
games 
in 
which 
Matthews 
has shown glimpses of what 
the Wolverines have always 
envisioned he could be, his 
postgame comments carried a 
decisively not-celebratory tone.
“All of y’all flattered by scoring 
points, that shit don’t matter.”
It’s a continuation of a theme 
for Matthews. After a loss, he 
doesn’t want to hear about the 
positives. After a win — like 
when his buzzer-beater helped 
Michigan past Minnesota three 
weeks ago — he rarely wants to 
hear about the negatives.
“I’m not a huge fan of the 
slogan ‘ugly wins,’ ” Matthews 
said after that game. “I just 
feel like you’re going against 
good teams and you can’t blow 
everybody out. I feel like if you 
can survive these ones, these are 
quality wins. You’ve got to be 
able to gut them out.”
The 
problem 
for 
the 
Wolverines on Tuesday is that 
they were never in a position 
to “gut out” a win. They went 
down eight just six minutes in, a 
deficit that became 16 with three 
technical free throws to start 
the second half. Winning would 
have required a miracle.
That miracle, though, almost 
came 
early 
in 
the 
second 
period. With 15:32 to play, the 
shot clock winding down and 

Michigan’s 
hopes 
dwindling 
with it, sophomore forward 
Isaiah Livers buried a three to 
pull the Wolverines within 12. 
Seven minutes later, after a pair 
of Matthews free throws, that 
deficit was down to four. For 
a moment, it seemed that the 
Nittany Lions’ luck had run out, 
that Michigan’s superiority had 
finally taken over.
Then, 
Michigan 
returned 
to the poor shot selection, bad 
rebounding and spotty defense 
that had doomed it in the first 
24 minutes. Just as soon as the 
Wolverines had cut the deficit to 
four, it was back to double digits, 
cementing their worst loss in 
over a year.
“We came back and fought, 
Saddi (Washington) did a hell of 
a job coaching,” Matthews said of 
the assistant coach who replaced 
Michigan coach John Beilein 
after his half-time ejection. “But 
the game was lost in the first 
half.”
Matthews’ assertion, though, 
is a simplification. As poorly as 
the Wolverines played in the 
first half, the game was not over. 
The game, it turned out, was 
only over when Michigan went 
back to the habits that put it 
down 16 in the first place. After a 
fleeting stretch of playing smart 
basketball — getting into the 
paint and to the free throw line 

— the Wolverines began forcing 
up contested threes and playing 
the style of isolation basketball 
that would have sent Beilein 
into a fury were he still on the 
sideline.
But as his team capitulated, 
Matthews remained Michigan’s 
one constant, nailing a jabstep 
three and a pair of free throws 
while his teammates went more 
than 11 minutes without scoring. 
For Matthews, it was a repeat 
of Saturday against Wisconsin, 
when he scored 14 of Michigan’s 
last 23 points en route to a 61-52 
win.
“It was good. He wants to 
win,” Beilein said. “There’s a 
sense of urgency with Charles. 
He wants to have a great year this 
year, and he’s working like crazy. 
I love the way he’s trending right 
now.”
Matthews’ take?
“We lost, it don’t matter.”
Because as well as he has 
played, his team has reached its 
collective worst in a season that 
has included far more highs than 
lows. And for Matthews — likely 
in his last season at Michigan — 
to reach the heights he imagined 
when he transferred here, his 
teammates 
need 
rediscover 
those highs.
“Time 
is 
running 
short,” 
Matthews said. “It ain’t no more, 
‘We’ll fix it later.’ Time is now.”

After wake-up call, Pastujov 
reemerging as contributor

There are few things that 
resonate more with an athlete 
than being benched.
It is a cut and dried message, 
forcing the player to do some 
self-reflecting while becoming 
an observer to the game. And it 
is one that Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson recently 
delivered 
to 
sophomore 
forward Michael 
Pastujov.
Pastujov 
got 
off to a quick 
start this season, 
recording 
three 
points 
through 
the 
first four games. 
He 
started 
the 
season 
against 
Vermont, 
featured on the top line alongside 
sophomore Josh Norris and junior 
Will Lockwood — perhaps the 
two most dynamic goal scorers on 
the roster. Needless to say, he was 
expected to be a key contributor 
for the Michigan hockey team 
throughout the year.
Then, from Oct. 7 to Dec. 1, 
Pastujov recorded just one point, 
missed three games due to injury, 
was moved off the top line and 
moved onto a line alongside his 
brother, junior Nick Pastujov. 
After that stretch, though, it 
seemed that he turned a corner 
when he rattled off a four-game 
point streak heading into the 
outdoor game on Jan. 5 against 
Notre Dame.
But just six days later when the 
team traveled to Columbus to face 
off against Ohio State, Pastujov 
did not appear in either game of 
the series.
Pearson 
was 
asked 
about 
Pastujov’s status after the 4-2 loss 
that Saturday.
“Yeah, he’s just a healthy 
scratch,” Pearson said. “He’s got 
to continue to work in practice and 

work harder to be able to compete 
in games like this. I know he can, 
but he’s just got to have some self-
reflection on his game and where 
he’s at and how hard he wants to 
play.”
From the top line to the sideline 
— Pearson gave the sophomore a 
wake-up call in hopes of having 
Pastujov perform to his fullest 
potential.
He made his 
return on Jan. 
24 against Penn 
State. 
And 
in 
his 
first 
game 
back on the ice, 
a 
reinvigorated 
Pastujov 
recorded an assist 
in a 5-1 victory. In 
the ensuing series 
split 
against 
Minnesota, 
he poured in three goals. He 
followed up that weekend with 
two goals against Michigan State, 
contributing to the Wolverines’ 
first series sweep in Big Ten play. 
“Pucks are finding me right 
now,” Pastujov said after last 
Friday’s 5-3 win against Michigan 
State. “It feels good. It’s nice 

when you’re playing with a guy 
like (Jake) Slaker and Jimmy 
(Lambert). It comes easy.”
Added Pearson: “We sat him 
out a while ago. He came in and 
we had a good talk with the staff 
and Mike about what direction 
his game was headed, and he 
had to make some changes. First 
and foremost, it just started 
with nothing with the puck, it’s 
just without it. Working harder. 
Competing harder. Usually, when 
you do that, things start to turn 
your way, and I think that’s what 
happened.
“He’s always been a skilled 
player, but you have to have 
more to your game than just 
being skilled … He took that 
conversation, he didn’t sulk, he 
didn’t — he just went and started 
playing better.”
It seems Pearson’s message 
resonated with Pastujov. The 
Wolverines can ill afford to have 
the talented forward’s offensive 
production disappear once more. 
Pastujov’s point total is now up 
to 14, and with only four games 
separating Michigan from the Big 
Ten tournament, his reemergence 
is coming at the right time.

Calming nerves: upperclassmen 
guide freshmen into program

Lexie Blair stepped to the 
plate this weekend with nerves 
running through her body. The 
freshman outfielder had never 
hit a regular season pitch for 
Michigan. She’s never even seen 
a regular season pitch.
She’s also gotten jitters before 
most games in her long history 
with the softball. But it didn’t 
show. Blair left 
Tampa, Fla. last 
weekend 
with 
her first college 
hits, 
runs 
and wins as a 
Wolverine.
Blair emerged 
statistically 
as 
an 
offensive 
leader 
with 
seven hits, four 
runs and a .412 
batting average on the weekend. 
On top of Blair’s success at the 
plate, the freshman also started 
the 
season 
with 
a 
perfect 
fielding percentage — a figure 
that many of her teammates 
share.
Blair 
came 
to 
Michigan 
talented, 
ranked 
the 
No. 
28 
overall 
2018 
recruiting 
prospect by FloSoftball, but her 

seemingly fluid transition to 
college softball also relied on 
Michigan softball’s atmosphere, 
also 
a 
staple 
in 
breakout 
freshman 
right-hander 
Alex 
Storako’s transition.
In her opening weekend, 
Storako pitched 18 strikeouts 
with a 1.13 WHIP.
“The 
team 
culture 
is 
electrifying,” Storako said. “Our 
motto is respect Team 42, and I 
think that is something not only 
in 
the 
sports 
world, but we 
all bring it to the 
classroom and to 
everyday life.”
The 
team’s 
emphasis 
on 
supporting 
younger athletes 
off 
the 
field 
isn’t just during 
the 
season. 
Upperclassmen 
moved freshmen into dorms in 
the fall, starting to integrate 
players as soon as they got to 
Ann Arbor. That mentorship has 
played a key role in developing 
effective communication on the 
field with freshmen starters.
Even with that tight-knit 
atmosphere, 
though, 
the 
transition in terms of level of 
play isn’t easy. Michigan coach 

Carol Hutchins — bringing in 
her 35th class of freshmen this 
season — thinks that the best 
way to build confidence after 
transitioning to college play is to 
challenge freshmen in practice.
“I think the best thing that 
they can take confidence in is 
when they work really hard and 
we give them really hard tasks 
and then they take care of the 
task,” Hutchins said. “Today 
we did a bases loaded drill for 
the hitters. It’s a really hard 
drill because they’re judged 
on if they really went for it, if 
you swung hard at the ball and 
attack the ball, and that’s a hard 
drill, but the more they do it the 
better they’ll get.”
And they have. Both Storako 
and Blair, despite room to 
improve, seem poised to play 
significant time going forward. 
They expect to learn from 
upperclassmen as the season 
goes on.
As far as nerves go, Blair may 
still worry before at-bats, but if 
anything could calm her nerves, 
this weekend was it.
“Of course, I’m nervous for 
every game, but I tell myself this 
is my thousandth time at bat, so 
be free and just let your hands 
do the work,” Blair said. “I was 
comfortable out there.”

Expect ‘M’ to come out swinging

Ako Thomas walks up to 
the plate. The senior infielder 
pauses as he tightens his 
batting gloves. He steps into 
the batter’s box, sinking into 
a shallow crouch. He drags his 
bat through the dirt, tapping 
it against the plate, before 
swinging it over his shoulder. 
There’s 
a 
tense 
moment 
brimming with expectation. 
Thomas 
readjusts 
his 
grip 
on the bat; it twitches on his 
shoulder. The pitcher turns the 
ball in his hand, takes a deep 
breath and then – finally – 
releases it. 
Thomas’ 
reaction 
is 
instantaneous. The bat leaves 
Thomas’ shoulder, upright in 
the air for a split second as 
his left foot kicks up. Then, 
moments later, the bat comes 
whistling through the air as 
Thomas sends all his pent-up 
energy towards the baseball 
hurtling at him. 
The crack of the ball meeting 
bat echoes through the air. 
The ball goes flying. 
This is a typical at-bat for 
Thomas, one of Michigan’s 
biggest 
offensive 
threats. 
He hit leadoff in both 2017 
and 
2018, 
and 
will 
very 

likely 
be 
an 
instrumental 
part of Michigan’s offensive 
performance 
this 
season. 
In 
2017, 
Thomas 
led 
the 
Wolverines in batting average 
at .354 and on-base percentage 
at .462 and had the team’s 
second-best OPS at .858.

The 
Michigan 
baseball 
team’s offense had a prolific 
season last year – averaging 6.2 
runs a game – and they don’t 
show any signs of slowing down 
this year. The Wolverines’ 
returning hitters, now a year 
stronger, will look to fill out 
what will be a dangerous lineup 
for opposing pitchers to stare 
down. An offseason of training 
has only made 
Michigan’s 
bats 
more 
dangerous. 
“We have a 
lot of individual 
hitters that did 
a 
very 
good 
job of adding 
some 
size, 
some strength 
and 
some 
explosiveness 
in the weight 
room, and that has translated 
with more bat speed and 
exit 
velocity 
amongst 
our 
hitters,” said Michigan coach 
Erik Bakich. “I see a group of 
kids who’ve gotten stronger, 
who’ve become more physical, 
so I would like to think we’re 
capable of hitting for more 
power this year.”
Among 
the 
Wolverines’ 
most 
potentially 
dangerous 
batters is junior outfielder 
Dominic Clementi, who hit 
.409 his freshman season, and 
led the team last year with 
a .368 average. Though his 
average dropped sophomore 
year, partly due to an increase 
in playing time – he went 
from playing in 18 games as 

a freshman to 44 games as 
a sophomore – his slugging 
percentage 
went 
up 
from 
.409 to .574 between seasons. 
Now another year stronger, 
Clementi is an intimidating 
prospect for any pitcher. 
Also 
looking 
to 
have 
a 
productive season of at-bats 
is 
Jordan 
Brewer. 
The 
junior outfielder is a recent 
transfer 
from 
Lincoln 
Trail 
Community 
College 
in 
Robinson, 
Ill., 
and hit for an 
average of .368 
over 
his 
two 
years playing for 
the 
Statesmen. 
He throws left-
handed and hits 
right-handed, 
and 
Bakich 
called him one of the team’s 
“most explosive athletes” and a 
“very dynamic player.”
The nine months of offseason 
training have brought back a 
team that looks to hit the ball 
even harder this year. Many 
returning players who have 
not been particularly powerful 
hitters in past seasons could be 
serious threats at the plate in 
2019. 
One such player is senior 
utility infielder Jimmy Kerr, 
who 
will 
likely 
start 
the 
season at either first or third 
this year. After a productive 
offseason, Kerr will look to 
put out numbers close to the 
.375 average he put up in his 
freshman 
year 
after 
down 
years the last two seasons. 
“He’s put on a lot of size, 
a lot of strength and a lot of 
explosiveness,” Bakich said. 
“He’s hitting the ball with a lot 
of juice in the bat, so it’s really 
good to see.”
With Thomas returning to 
the top of the order, strength 
from players like Clementi and 
Brewer adding power in the 
middle of the lineup and added 
sparks from hitters like Kerr, 
Michigan will be putting an 
intimidating group of hitters 
up to bat in 2019. 
Opposing pitchers beware.

Position review: Tight Ends

With the Michigan football 
team’s 2018 regular season in the 
books, The Daily looks back at the 
performance of each unit this year 
and peers ahead to the future in 
2019. In this edition: tight ends.
When the Wolverines went 
8-5 in 2017, one of the lowest 
points in a disappointing season 
was the performance of the 
receiving 
corps. 
Just 
three 
players cracked 300 yards on the 
season — barely. Wide receiver 
Grant Perry had 307 yards, 
followed by junior tight end Zach 
Gentry and sophomore tight end 
Sean McKeon with 303 yards 
and 301 yards, respectively. 
And while the wide receivers 

struggled 
as 
a 
result 
of 
inconsistent quarterback play, 
the tight ends became security 
blankets for the rotating string of 
Michigan starting quarterbacks. 
Gentry, especially, at 6-foot-8, 
was valuable as a checkdown 
option almost every time he was 
on the field.
In 2018, junior quarterback 
Shea Patterson locked up the 
starting job and continued the 
trend of leaning on the tight ends. 
Gentry finished the season with 
the third-highest receiving total 
at 514 yards and two touchdowns. 
Junior Nick Eubanks — after 
catching two passes for 61 yards 
in his sophomore season — 
caught eight receptions for 157 
yards and a touchdown.
HIGH POINT: Early on in 

Michigan’s Oct. 6 game against 
Maryland, Patterson faked a 
handoff to senior running back 
Karan Higdon and dropped back 
to pass. The offensive line gave 
him time to set up for the throw 
and he saw Gentry wide open on 
a crossing route 31 yards down 
the field.
Gentry made the catch — his 
first of a career-high seven on 
the day.
It was a tight-end heavy 
drive, as evidenced by McKeon’s 
catch three plays later that put 
Michigan 
on 
the 
Terrapins’ 
16-yard line which set up redshirt 
sophomore kicker Quinn Nordin 
for a field-goal attempt to put the 
Wolverines ahead, 3-0.
At the end of the game, which 
Michigan won 42-21, Gentry had 

notched a team-high 112 yards 
on seven catches for an average 
of 16 yards per catch. The next 
closest receiver was sophomore 
wide receiver Nico Collins, who 
finished with one catch for 51 
yards.
It was a career day for Gentry 
and exemplified his development 
since 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh decided to change him 
from quarterback to tight end.
“He’s really worked hard,” 
Harbaugh said. “Everything you 
want a tight end to be, he’s really 
growing into a prototypical type 
of tight end.”
LOW POINT: The Ohio State 
game may well have been the 
low point for the entire team 
last season, but it was certainly 
the low point for the tight ends. 

The three main tight ends — 
Eubanks, Gentry and McKeon — 
were held to four catches for 21 
total yards combined.
Eubanks saw most of his usage 
throughout the season as a deep 
threat, with a season average of 
19.6 yards per catch. But against 
the Buckeyes, his two catches 
totaled eight yards with a long 
of seven — not quite the numbers 
he’d been putting up earlier in 
the season. McKeon caught just 
two passes for 13 yards.
After spending a whole season 
as one of the go-to check downs 
for Patterson, Gentry didn’t 
make an appearance on the stat 
sheet in his final regular season 
game as a Wolverine.
Early in the second quarter, 
Michigan had the ball on the 
Ohio State 13-yard line on third 
down with six yards to go. 
Patterson found Gentry on his 
way into the end zone and gave 
him a chance to catch it. But 
Gentry couldn’t hang on, and 
Michigan was forced to kick a 
field goal that left them one point 
off the lead.
Later in the game, Gentry 
dropped another would-be catch 
that would’ve gone for a first 
down. Instead, he left the game 
with a concussion. Gentry was 
expected to cap his career season 
with 
a 
strong 
performance 
against the Wolverines’ biggest 
rival, but the end result was 
certainly disappointing.
THE 
FUTURE: 
After 
a 
breakout season — despite the 
slow finish to his year at Ohio 
State — Gentry declared for the 
NFL Draft. That leaves McKeon, 
Eubanks 
and 
a 
handful 
of 
freshmen and sophomores that 
haven’t seen much, if any, game 
action in the returning tight end 
group.
McKeon’s production dipped 
in his junior season after a 
strong 
sophomore 
campaign 
in 2017. This past season, his 

lone touchdown came against 
Western Michigan in the second 
game of the season and he never 
had more than 29 receiving 
yards in a single game. With 
Gentry departing, McKeon will 
be expected to step into that role 
and return to his 2017 numbers.
In 
his 
first 
three 
years, 
Eubanks’ role took a backseat 
to McKeon and Gentry, who 
asserted themselves as the two 
primary tight ends. He was 
largely used as a deep threat and 
targeted less than a handful of 
times in each game. But now that 
Gentry is gone, Michigan will be 
in need of a second tight end that 
has game experience. Eubanks 
figures to be that player.
Outside 
of 
McKeon 
and 
Eubanks, Michigan lists six 
tight ends on the roster. The 
most important names to know 
among the returning group are 
sophomore Carter Selzer and 
freshmen Mustapha Muhammad 
and Luke Schoonmaker. 
Muhammad, who has yet to 
appear in a game, was a four-
star recruit out of Texas and 
ranked No. 168 in his class, per 
247Sports. Selzer was lightly 
recruited, but at 6-foot-8 may 
replace Gentry as a big pass-
catching threat in his third year 
after playing in just three games 
in 2018. Schoonmaker has made 
only one game appearance, but 
he did it all for his Connecticut 
high school and will add a wide 
range of skills for Michigan.
The 
Wolverines 
signed 
only one tight end in the 2019 
class — four-star Erick All. All 
enrolled early and has a chance 
to contribute starting in the fall.
The tight ends have always 
been a valuable position group 
for Harbaugh. With the addition 
of new offensive coordinator 
Josh Gattis, it remains to be seen 
how much the tight ends will be 
utilized, but Gattis has a talented 
group with which to work.

International experience paying dividends for Hillmon and Brown

Last 
May, 
while 
her 
classmates at Gilmour Academy 
in 
Cleveland 
were 
officially 
receiving 
their 
diplomas 
in 
front of their teachers, friends 
and families, Naz Hillmon was 
playing basketball.
She was 1,402 miles away in 
Colorado Springs, Colo. in the 
midst of trying out for the USA 
Under-18 
Women’s 
National 
team. Just two years prior, 
Hillmon had been cut from 
the U-16 team. Having made a 
considerable impression, USA 
Basketball invited her back for 
another go-around.
Despite a stressful final day of 
cuts, Hillmon secured her spot 
on a team loaded with Division-
One talent.
“Honestly I thought I was 
going to make it the first time 
more than I did the second 
time,” Hillmon said. “It was very 
nerve-racking just because there 
is talent there that you’ve maybe 
seen in AAU (Amateur Athletic 
Union) and high school but for 
all of them to be at one space 
was different. You don’t see 
that often, and I hadn’t been to 
college yet.”
In 
August, 
she 
and 
her 
teammates traveled to Mexico 
City 
to 
participate 
in 
the 
FIBA U-18 Women’s Americas 
Championship. 
There, 
they 
visited the ancient Teotihuacan 
Pyramids and sampled Mexican 
street food.
“We were able to travel a little 
bit,” Hillmon said. “That was 
my first time out of the country, 
so being able to experience 
that culture and eat some of 
the foods was cool. There was 
this restaurant and some of my 
teammates were eating crickets. 
I remember that. It freaked me 
out.”
On top of their off-court 
adventures, Hillmon and her 
teammates won the gold medal 
— the program’s ninth in a row.
Even after starting only one 
of the team’s six games, Hillmon 
averaged 10.3 points and just 
under six rebounds during the 

tournament. Her role off the 
bench was a new experience, 
but one she fully embraced 
in preparation for life at the 
next level and her role as the 
Wolverines’ sixth-woman. 
“It’s one of those things 
where you have to be ready no 
matter what,” Hillmon said. 
“Even in AAU, I rarely came 
off the bench so I had to know 
that when I came in, I couldn’t 
make the same mistakes as the 
group of girls already there. And 
I knew in that period I had to 
do something. I had to cheer on 
my team and mentally prepare 
myself to get in the game.”
In her first season with 
the 
Michigan 
women’s 
basketball 
program, 
Hillmon 
has flourished. The freshman 
forward leads the team in both 
scoring and rebounding. During 
the Wolverines’ current four-
game win streak, Hillmon is 
averaging 16 points and 8.5 
rebounds in just 23 minutes.
Hillmon 
isn’t 
the 
only 
Michigan contributor with ties to 
international basketball, though. 
In 
fact, 
starting 
sophomore 
forward Hailey Brown has four 
years on Hillmon in terms of 
national team experience.
A native of Hamilton, Ontario, 
Brown has played in 41 games 
as a member of the Canadian 
national team since 2013.
Like Hillmon, Brown’s most 
recent involvement with the 
national team came the summer 
before her freshman year at 
Michigan. Brown helped Canada 
win a bronze medal at the 2017 
U-19 World Cup in Udine, Italy, 
averaging 10 points and nine 
rebounds in 26 minutes per 
game.
“That’s 
something 
I’ll 
remember because that’s the 
highest we’ve ever placed in 
the 
world 
championships,” 
Brown said. “That was definitely 
an amazing experience and 
I had the opportunity for my 
family to go up there with me 
as well, so I got to share it with 
my teammates, coaches and 
my family. That was a great 
memory.”
For both Hillmon and Brown, 

putting 
on 
their 
respective 
country’s jersey goes far beyond 
the medals and on-the-court 
accolades, though.
“You always talk about playing 
for the front of the jersey, not the 
back. And that’s 
the 
ultimate 
front 
of 
the 
jersey,” Hillmon 
said. “You’re not 
representing 
yourself at that 
point. 
You’re 
representing 
your nation. Not 
everybody 
gets 
that opportunity 
and 
you 
understand that.”
Brown 
added: 
“You’re 
representing 
your 
family, 
your community, your school, 

your teammates, coaches. As a 
program, we always talk about 
the national team players who 
paved the way for us to get there, 
so that’s something we respect 
when we put on the Canadian 
jersey.”
Aided 
by 
their 
prior 
international 
experience, 
Hillmon 
and 
Brown 
transitioned 
quickly 
to 
the 
college 
game. 
Hillmon 
has 
factored 
in 
significantly this 
season, while Brown started 
27 games last season before 
going down with a season-
ending injury. Going up against 

elite talent from all over the 
world and getting a chance to 
experience the unique styles of 
the international game went a 
long way in preparing them for 
their times as Wolverines.
“Both of these young ladies 
were 
extremely, 
extremely 
nervous because they missed 
summer 
school 
coming 
in,” 
said 
Michigan 
coach 
Kim 
Barnes Arico. “They thought 
our freshmen were going to be 
way more advanced than they 
were because they were here all 
summer. But the opportunities 
they had really put themselves 
ahead of even our freshmen who 
are allowed to be here over the 
summer.”
And 
Barnes 
Arico 
is 
no 
stranger to the international 
game herself. She spent two 

years with USA Basketball as 
an assistant under head coach 
and three-time Olympian Dawn 
Staley with the under-18 and 
under-19 teams in 2014 and 
2015. Having coached women 
of Hillmon and Brown’s age at 
the international level, Barnes 
Arico knows just how beneficial 
that experience is to their 
development.
“I was with young kids all 
summer before they went into 
their freshman years of college,” 
Barnes Arico said. “Without a 
doubt, that experience, whether 
that was practicing against that 
level of talent every day or then 
playing 
internationally, 
that 
level prepared them for their 
first years of college.
“They didn’t come in as 
normal college freshmen.”

@thecuteboyinthecom-
puterlab Hi I’ve seen you 
around but I’m too shy to 
say hi. Shoot your shot ;) 

To Planet Earth, for 
there is no place in this 
universe that I love more.

Me > Achu (just marry 
me instead) 

You are the avocado to 
my toast, the Rick to my 
Morty, and the Reese’s 

to my pieces. How lucky 
am I to find someone that 
makes everyday an adven-
ture. I am so excited to 
continue this journey with 
you. I love you <3

Ehtan and Lin, best 
roommates eva!!!!

Dear Nicholas, thanks 
for being the most pre-
cious person in my life. I 
couldn’t ask for a better 
partner in crime, pillar of 
support or someone I can 
watch The Bachelor with. 
Love you so much - Lil 
boo.

Kelly STARbler, an icon 
living, sending you all the 
love today & everyday <3

To the brightest star

amazing. Love, 
Ryan

Please remove 
the submission 
I previously 
submitted about 
half an hour ago. 
Inside joke didn’t 
go over well, 
thank you sorry. 

Dear Jack: I love the 
way you play Catan. It 
reminds me of Griffin 
Knoll back in ‘09. The way 
you play your knights and 
place settlements inspires 
me to be a better Catan 
player. Love, Sufyan Pan-
dit 

milan gupta :)
Dear Hel- thank you 
endlessly for the oreos in 
peanut butter, the inside-
out-backwards-sleep-

advice. You deserve the 
world. XOXO

Dear Nita. There isn’t 
NEARLY enough space 
here to say how much 
you mean to me. My life 
with you in it has been so 
amazing that I can’t even 
remember what it was 
like before I had you. You 
brighten my life and every 
day in it. Love, Adrian 

Congratulations Timo-
thy!! I’m so proud of you- 
you deserve this more

Thank you Alex, Caits,

excuses to put off my 
homework even more. 
Love you all!

Anjali, you are the 
smartest person I know 
and you’re going to be a 
great doctor in the future.

Shrinali, you are a fan-
tastic artist and the most

Lucy - your hair is 
tamed fire, a blaze almost 
as strong as my surrepti-
tious love for you. Burn, 
let burn - flame through 
and through.

Tunde -- On that fateful 
day in March, there was 
simply a meme, featuring 
Powerade and macaroni, 
that will live in my heart 
forever. I love you!

hi bbs. i like your head-
phones but not your air-
pods

I can’t believe this all 
started with a text that 

said “I’m going to shoot 
my shot, I’m back in Ann 
Arbor. Wanna grab cof-
fee?”... Five months later 
and you make me so happy 

Sol, You’re the icing 
on my cinnamon roll, the 
wag in my tail, my proof of 
miracles. - Aud

Milind Rao my beloved 
you are the light of my life. 
Each and every time I see 
you I have a small heart 
attack. Whenever you look 
back at me I fall in love 
with you all over again. 
Call me back soon. Please.

To the TMD staff - 
Thank you for all the great 
work so far this year. Con-
sistently amazed by what 
you all can do! Love, Maya 

I’m a basketball player, 
and you’re my girlfriend, 
and you’re cool :)

AAR forever & always 
<3

Hey! You’ve been on 
my mind for a long time. 
To be honest, you always 
are. You’re my best friend 
and it seems weird to ask 
you out on a date here but 
I really like you a lot. So, 
let’s go out! Meet me!

Hannah Doerr, you’re 
beautiful and here’s a joke 
you’ll appreciate: When a 
third grader was asked to 
cite Newton’s first law, she 
said, “Bodies in motion 
remain in motion, and 
bodies at rest stay in bed 
unless their mothers call 
them to get up.” <3 

Hey! You don’t know 
who I am through this 
survey but I know who 
you are. Your smile is so 
bright and your laugh 
makes my day. You tell me 
everything and I want to 
be more than your best 
friend. Will you be my val-
entine?

Dear Muriel, you make 
me smile like a co-oper 
finding a vintage beer in 
the basement. I love you 
more than nutritional 
yeast. Will you spend the 
rest of your life with me 
on the water bed? 

You’re the love of my 
life and I can’t wait to 
spend the rest of our lives 
together! I love you so 
much! Xoxo, Your Lovey

Happy Valentines Day, 
Ryan! Thanks for a great 

four years. I know you 
read this paper, so I hope 
you randomly see this! 
ILYIAB!

Elena, there is no other 
person I would like to 
share a 11x12 room with, 
cry with, eat cheese with, 
watch Dance Moms with, 
listen to ASAP Forever 
with, and take nightly 
showers next to. 

Daniel, Thank you for 
being my best friend, my 
partner, and the love of my 
life. I’m so lucky! Happy 
Valentine’s Day! Love, 
Morgan

Anna, alli, and chloe 
we’re so excited to live 
with you hams next year! 

Samantha (aka SRG)!!!! 
I don’t have a whole lot to 
say except for the fact that 
I’m extremely thankful 
for your existence. You’re 
amazing in so many ways. 
Love you LOTS

to my future room-
mate, I love you so much 
and you’re the reason I 
didn’t transfer. I genuinely 
appreciate you more than 
you’ll ever know. 

Jenna, I DIG you. Will 
you be my valentine? -#1 
#10 fan 

Alex Harring, I love you
Sophie Kephart, I love 
you

Hello Erin! I am so very 
happy we have become 
close friends. I really 
don’t know what I would 
do without you. Here’s to 
more study sessions, late 
night chats, and 3 hour 
long dinners. Happy Val-
entine’s Day! Love, Liz

Anita- You are the 
queen of spreading love; at 
the Daily and beyond! So 
lucky to have 10+ years of 
friendship going strong <3

Phoebe- Sending so 
much love and gratitude 
to my favorite galentine! 
So lucky you chose me 
to message on facebook 
almost 2 years ago because 
there’s no one else I would 
want to call my forever 
roomie <3

Rose! You rock, you 
rule, you’re always cool. 
I love you so much, truly, 
your fool. 

Wishing all my sweet 
friends a Valentine’s Day 
full of happiness, sun-

shine and love because 
ya’ll deserve it! Thank you 
for bringing me joy every 
single day! And a Happy 
V-day shoutout to my 
Mom because I just really 
love her:) XO, Caycee 

Hey Doris Li, you’re 
always so dominant in 
my thoughts… are you the 
fifth degree of a diatonic 
scale?? Or are you a fer-
mata in Beethoven’s Fifth 
Symphony? Because I 
want to hold you and not 
let go :((

Bre, texting you out 
of the blue last August 
was the best decision I’ve 
made all year. Whether 
we’re superbly dressed 
in Pinball Pete’s or just 
hanging out watching TV, 
I have an amazing time 
and appreciate you so 
much. You know who this 
is from :)

Hassan, Thank you for 
always being a goofball, 
encouraging me, and 
lending a listening ear. I 
appreciate you beyond 
words and know that 
you’re going to accomplish 
many amazing things 
in your lifetime, and I 
can’t wait to see them. 
-Miranda 

Mom and dad, I know 
I can never thank you 
enough for the sacrifices 
you have made, the humor 
you have brought into my 
life, and the experiences 
and lessons that have 
shaped me. I appreciate 
you both beyond words. 
Love, Mir

Becoming best friends 
that night at your cousin’s, 
hours spent in cars talk-
ing, all the times you’ve 
cheered me up, the coffee 
and the food (mochi!)… So 
many great memories, I 
can’t wait for all the ones 

we’ll continue to make. 
Love you Victoria!

Lizzy, I channeled my 
flannel and you rocked my 
socks! I love you! - Finn

Happy Valentine’s Day 
my love! I love you so 
much and I can’t wait to 
celebrate all our future 
Valentine’s Days together! 
I love you, so so so oh so 
much, infinity x infinity, 
forever and always! Xoxo, 
Lovey
