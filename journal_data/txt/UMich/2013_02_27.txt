RESEARCH
Researchers:
cancer drug
* effective for
more patients


Treatment
previously thought
to be limited to 20
percent of cases
By IAN DILLINGHAM
Daily Staff Reporter
The National Cancer Insti-
tute estimates that nearly
40,000 women will die of breast
cancer in 2013. After analyzing
past medical records, Univer-
sity researchers hope to reduce
that number with the increased
use of Herceptin, a treatment
currently used in 20 percent of
breast cancer cases.
Herceptin, which was only
thought to be effective in
patients who tested positive for
the HER2 protein, was shown to
have positive affects in HER2-
negative patients as well. These
previously unknown benefits
could directly impact 65 percent
of breast cancer patients who do
not currently receive it as apart
of their treatment.

Max Wicha, the director of
the University's Comprehensive
Cancer Center, and the study's
primary author, explained that
the treatment, called adju-
vant therapy, involves the use
of drugs after the tumor is
removed.
"One of the biggest advances
in breast cancer treatments has
been the development of these
targeted drugs that can target
specific genetic defects and can-
cers," Wicha said. "We give the
therapy, even though - after the
cancer is removed - there's no
direct evidence that the woman
has the cancer."
Use of Herceptin in this man-
ner has been shown to prevent
cancer from reoccurring in half
of HER2-postive patients.
"We know that some of the
women, despite the fact that
we removed the cancer, get a
recurrence of the cancer, some-
times years later," Wicha said.
"That's what is fatal - that the
cancer spreads or metastasizes
elsewhere ... The purpose of the
adjuvant therapy is to kill any

Sex crime reports
rise, likely result
of new policy
By AUSTEN HUFFORD
Daily Staff Reporter
An annual report released by
the University's primary discipline
unit for students shows a marked

increase in the number of sexual
misconduct cases investigated
internally by the University, even
though the total number of disci-
plinary cases handled decreased.
The increase follows an August
2011 federal mandate and the sub-
sequent implementation of a new
interim sexual misconduct allega-
tion policy.
The number of sexual assault
and sexual harassment reports

handled through the Univer-
sity's internal disciplinary pro-
cess increased from three to
62 between the 2011 to 2012
academic year, when the policy
went into effect, and the year
prior, according to a newly
released report from the Office
of Student Conflict Resolutions,
which is responsible for dealing
with non-academic violations of
the Statement of Student Rights

and Responsibilities.
The 2011to2012 annual report
detailed 497 reported violations
of the StatementofStudentRights
and Responsibilities during the
year, which is a 7-percent drop
from the 537 received during the
2010 to2011academic year.

White House memo makes
research records public

Federally-funded
research must
be online
By RACHEL PREMACK
Daily StaffReporter
The results of federally fund-
ed research at the University
and other institutions across the
country will now be available for
public viewing.
A policy memorandum issued
by the White House Friday
requires that all results from
research that is partially or fully

funded by the government must
be available to the publicwithin a
year of publication if the research
institute has a research budget of
$100 million or more.
This policy could have major
implications for University
research, because 62 percent of
funding is from the federal gov-
ernment.
John Holdren, director of the
White House Office of Science
and Technology Policy, wrote in
the memorandum that the policy
will spur scientific entrepreneur-
ship and innovation.
"For example, open weather
data underpins the forecasting

industry and provides great pub-
lic benefits, and making genome
sequences publicly available has
spawned many biotechnology
innovations," Holdren wrote.
A petition on We the People -
a website created by the Obama
administration where citizens
can launch petitions that will be
considered if they reach a mini-
mum number of signatures -
launched in May 2012 insisting
that taxpayer-funded research
be publicly accessible. The peti-
tion, which specified that the
research should be available in
digital format, became the cata-

Sick of cookie-cutter syllabi?
The Flipped Semester is ready
to serve Michigan students who
have a knack for the unconven-

tional.
The Flipped Semester is a
proposed program unique to the
University that would allow stu-
dents to take part in self-directed
entrepreneurial projects while
earning nine academic credits.
The program was proposed by
a group of students within the
Entrepreneurship Commission
of the Central Student Govern-
ment. Currently, they are trying
to measure and build student

interest for the program, while
simultaneously working to gain
approval from University admin-
istrators.
Students enrolled in the pro-
gram would be immersed in a
50-student learning community
and eight to 10 professors with
entrepreneurial experience.

UPenn sees breakthrough

r-HAIL TO THE VICTORS

After approximately 20
years of work, Carl June
and his research team have
made a breakthrough in
T-cell immunotherapy, a
type of emerging cancer
treatment, The Daily Penn-
sylvanian reported Monday.
Nine out of 12 patients
who received the treatment
since 2011 have respond-
ed favorably to it. June
described the treatment as
a blood transfusion, except
with the patent's own blood,
which has been altered in
a lab. June told the Penn-
sylvanian that there has
not been a single precedent
where a treatment method

like this has gone from a
laboratory setting to treat-
ing actual patients, unless it
was done by a pharmaceuti-
cal company.
UCLA teaching assis-
tant makes learning musi-
cal
A UCLA teaching assis-
tant has blended science
with music to engage and
educate students in his
classes, The Daily Bruin
reported Monday.
Julio Rodriguez, a teach-
ing assistant studying phys-
ics at UCLA, came up with
the idea of using instru-

ments to demonstrate
concepts in his physics,
astronomy and engineering
classes during his first year
as a graduate student. While
tuning his violin one eve-
ning, Rodriguez found he
could show sound interfer-
ence by pluckingthe strings.
"With physics and all sci-
ences, we're basically trying
to discover the language of
the universe. It's already
written. It's already there,"
Rodriguez said. "But with
music, that's something that
comes from the creativity of
the human mind."

Voters to choose replacement for'
Jesse Jackson Jr. in dem. primary

Costs to maintain Los Angeles nuclear
power plant skyrocket after repairs

Campaign
dominated by
debate on gun
issues
CHICAGO (AP) - After a
fierce primary campaign domi-
nated by gun control, ethics and
economic woes, voters were
choosing the likely replacement
for Jesse Jackson Jr. on Tuesday,
three months after his legal trou-
bles and battle with depression
forced the son of the civil rights
leader to resign from Congress.
The Democratic front-run-
ners - former state Rep. Robin
Kelly, former U.S. Rep. Debbie
Halvorson and Chicago Alder-
man Anthony. Beale - made
Election Day stops through the

blistery winter weather at train
stations and restaurants in the
district, which spans Chicago's
South Side, south suburbs and
some rural areas.
They were among 14 Demo-
crats and four Republicans in the
special primary, but the Demo-
cratic winner was expected to
sail through the April 9 gen-
eral election because the area is
heavily Democratic.
Halvorson, who lost a pri-
mary challenge to Jackson last
year, has been targeted for her
position on gun control, which
became a key issue in the dis-
trict, parts of which have been
deeply affected by Chicago's gun
violence.
Independence USA, the super
PAC of New York City Mayor
Michael Bloomberg, poured
more than $2 million into the

race for anti-gun ads in support
of Kelly and against Halvorson, a
former state lawmaker and one-
term congresswoman. Kelly sup-
ports an assault-weapons ban,
but Halvorson does not.
After casting her ballot,
Halvorson warned that if the
ads are successful Bloomberg
will try to "buy seats" across the
country.
"We can'tletthathappen," she
said.
Beale also took issue with the
ads, saying people are "extreme-
lyupset" that someone from New
York is trying to tell people in
Illinois how to vote and predict-
ing that there will be a "back-
lash."
The guns issue dominated
candidate forums and television
ads and also appeared to have
resonated with voters.

Governor Beebe
vetoes abortion
ban
Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe
on Tuesday vetoed a ban on most
abortions in Arkansas at 20 weeks
into a pregnancy, setting up an
override fight with a Republican-
controlled Legislature that has
beenpushingfor morerestrictions
on the procedure.
Beebe said he vetoed the ban,
which is based on the disputed
belief that a fetus can feel pain at
20 weeks, because it runs afoul
of the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973
Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized
abortion until the point where
fetuses can survive outside the
* womb, usually at 22 to 24 weeks.
The Republican sponsor of the
measure said he'll seek to override
Beebe's veto.
"Because it would impose a ban
on a woman's right to choose an
elective, nontherapeutic abortion
before viability, House Bill 1037,
if it became law, would squarely
contradict Supreme Court prece-
dent," Beebe said in his veto letter.
"When I was sworn in as governor
I took an oath to preserve, protect
and defend both the Arkansas
Constitution and the Constitution
of the United States. I take that
oath seriously."

"transformative opportunity"
for entrepreneurial students.
"We want to empower stu-
dents with a new space that
will allow them to collaborate,"
Strauss said. "They can create
something incredible that would
be difficult to do while enrolled
in full-time courses."
Strauss said he expects the
program to be a reality by fall
2013 or winter 2014.
Business junior Mathias
Arkayin, another member of the
commission, hopes that students
would use the Flipped Semester
to undertake "risky" projects,
such as starting a company,
recording an album or filming a
movie. Students would be able
to appropriate time to these
endeavors if a curriculum were
designed to provide credit hours
for them, he said.
"The idea is that we want to
let students take a calculated
risk under an environment that

is risk-averse," Arkayin said. "At
the core, we are trying to free up
student time so they can devote
more of their time towards their
passion."
Although specific details
regarding the admission pro-
cess to the program haven't been
decided, Engineering sopho-
more Dan Rodak said Flipped
Semester would be highly selec-
tive. Though past entrepreneur-
ial experience would not be a
necessary prerequisite, it would
signal a strong candidate.
Different from existing inde-
pendent study curriculum,
the Flipped Semester would
facilitate cross-communication
among its members. Multiple
students would be able to work
together on the same entrepre-
neurial initiative and gain help
from one another.
"There is going to be a com-
munity formed, and they will be
able to rely on one another and
collaborate with one another in
smaller space," Rodak said.
Strauss believes the long-
term entrepreneurial projects in

which students would partake
during the program would allow
students to showcase their cre-
ations to employers and demon-
strate their capabilities outside
of the classroom setting.
The Flipped Semester orga-
nizers are currently in meetings
with University administrators
to talk ahout credit- collahora-
tion with other programs such
as the Program in Entrepreneur-
ship. To be a part of the "larger
ecosystem" of the University,
organizers said accreditation is
important.
' CSG President Manish Parikh
did not doubt the plausibility of
the Flipped Semester, provided
that administrators and stu-
dents alike would back it.
"(The Flipped Semester) is a
bit of a crazy idea," Parikh said.
"But I genuinely believe that
those are the only ideas worth
pursuing -crazy, ambitious,
inspiring ideas."

Brutal clash between Syrian
rebels and gov. forces

United Nations

since conflict began
in 2011
BEIRUT (AP) - Syrian reb-
els battled government troops
near a landmark 12th century
mosque in the northern city of
Aleppo on Tuesday, while fierce
clashes raged around a police
academy west of the city, activ-
ists said.
The fighting near the
Umayyad Mosque in the walled
Old City threatened to further
damage the historic structure,
part of which was burned dur-
ing clashes last year.
Since July 2012, government
forces and rebels seeking to
topple President Bashar Assad
have been battling over Alep-
po, the country's largest city
and a major prize in the civil
war. While rebels have gradu-
ally expanded the amount of

turf under their control, seven
months of street fighting, air-
strikes and shelling have left
much of the city, considered
one of Syria's most beautiful, in
ruins.
The Britain-based Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights
reported intense clashes with
heavy gunfire and explosions
near the mosque. Syria's state
news agency said "terrorists"
had detonated explosives near
the building's south wall, caus-
ing "material damages."
Assad's regime refers to the
opposition as "terrorists."
The mosque, also known as
the Great Mosque of Aleppo,
sits near a medieval covered
market in the Old City, which
is a UNESCO World Heritage
site. The mosque was heavily
damaged in October, 2012, just
weeks after a fire gutted the
market.
Syria's nearly 2-year-old
civil war has left its mark on
other gems of the country's rich
archaeological and cultural

heritage.
At least five of Syria's six
World Heritage sites have
been damaged in the fight-
ing, according to UNESCO, the
U.N.'s cultural agency. Loot-
ers have broken into one of the
world's best-preserved Crusad-
er castles, Crac des Chevaliers,
and ruins in the ancient city of
Palmyra have been damaged.
Both rebels and regime forc-
es have turned some of Syria's
significant historic sites into
bases, including citadels and
Turkish bath houses, while
thieves have stolen artifacts
from archaeological excava-
tions and, to a lesser extent,
museums.
To the west of Aleppo, activ-
ists reported fresh fighting
Tuesday near the police acad-
emy that has become a key gov-
ernment military installation.
The observatory said the
two sides were shelling each
other's positions while the gov-
ernment launched airstrikes in
the area.

Online gambling legal in NJ

Online gambling
will raise $235
million in revenue
TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Get
ready for betting in your jam-
mies, at work, from the kitchen
table, or at the beach: New Jer-
seyans - and possibly manyoth-
ers - will soon be able to gamble
over the Internet.
New Jersey Gov. Chris
Christie signed a bill Tuesday
legalizing Internet gambling,
hours after the state legislature
passed a revised bill that made
the changes he wanted. They
included setting a 10-year trial
period for online betting, and
raising the taxes on the Atlantic
City casinos' online winnings
from 10 to15 percent.
New Jersey became the third
state in the nation to legalize
gambling over the Internet. The
lawmakers' votes and Christie's
signature marked the largest
expansion of legalized gambling
in New Jersey since the first
casino began operating in Atlan-
tic City in 1978.

Nevada and Delaware have
passed laws legalizing Internet
betting, which also is going on
offshore, untaxed and unregu-
lated.
"This was a critical decision,
and one that I did not make
lightly," Christie said. "But with
the proper regulatory frame-
work and safeguards that I
insisted on including in the bill,
I am confident that we are offer-
ing a responsible yet exciting
option that will make Atlantic
City more competitive while
also bringing financial benefits
to New Jersey as a whole."
The idea is to help the strug-
gling casinos by attracting new
gamblers who are not now visit-
ing the casinos. The comps, like
free hotel rooms, show tickets,
meals or other freebies, would
be accrued from online play, but
would have to be redeemed in
person at a casino, presumably
enticing a player to spend more
money while there.
Tony Rodio, president of the
Casino Association of New Jer-
sey, welcomed the new opportu-
nities for his industry.
"The objectives for the con-

tinued stabilization, develop-
ment and success of Atlantic
City that Gov. Christie and our
legislature has facilitated over
the past couple of years have
taken a significant step forward
today with the passage of Inter-
net gaming," he said.
The advent of Internet gam-
bling is particularly good news
for one of Atlantic City's most
struggling casinos, The Atlantic
Club Casino Hotel. It is in the
process of being bought by the
parent company of PokerStars,
the world's largestpoker web site.
"Our state leaders have
stepped up, worked together
and seized this moment," said
Michael Frawley, the casino's
chief operating officer. "New
Jersey will be better for it as the
benefits of I-gaming for our state
are only beginning to be fully
appreciated. We strongly believe
that the economic development
and reinvestment in Atlantic
City, driven through I-gaming,
will be remembered as a criti-
cal turning point for this proud
town. We look forward to the
renewed success this new law
will surely bring."

Keep Ann Arbor weird
Restructuring of art program preserves the city's vibrant culture
As Congress battles over how to reduce the federal deficit, Ann
Arbor has its own concerns: public art. Ann Arbor's public
art task force was created this past December after Proposal
B failed to pass in the November elections. Proposal B called for the
elimination of the Percent for Art funding in the city, which requires
that one percent of the money from city capital projects be pooled for
city art. Under the Percent for Arts funding, art must be permanent
and somehow linked to the fund paying for the project. The task force
recently enumerated several proposals to improve art in the commu-
nity, including calls for an art supervisor, increased community dona-
tions, more community interaction and the elimination of Percent for
Art. The task force's recommendations are a reasonable restructure
and will be essential in helping Ann Arbor stay culturally relevant.

There's a tale by Charles
Dickens called "A Christ-
mas Carol." For those of
you who haven't
encountered it,
I'll summarize:
A crotchety old
man is visited by
his dead lend-
ing partner and
three other
ghosts who JOSEPH
teach him the
true meaning of HORTON
Christmas. With
springbreak
here, with my students itching for
far-off shores and the soft sheets of
home, and feeling myself sufficient-
ly old and crotchety, let me detail
my visitation by the four ghosts of
spring breaks past.
My freshman year, I went home.
Instead of staying in Los Angeles
and exploring my new city, instead
of taking up new friends on their
offers of Mexico or Arizona or
northern California, I went home
to Colorado. I judged a high-school
speech and debate tournament
I'd won the year before. I knew
everything and everyone - I was
the returning champion. I was the
guy who came home and expected
everyone to marvel at his collegiate
life. My high school had always been
small, and I expected it to be that
much smaller for all I'd grown. My
sister, two years behind me, was still
on the team, but she was busy with
her friends. My coaches had new
students to instruct. The tourna-
ment crowned a champion as I sat in
the back of the auditorium.
My freshman ghost reminds me of
all the chances I missed and teaches
me that comfort has its place, but it
needs to know its place too.
My sophomore year, I went on a
service trip to the Navajo Nation.
No more going home, but none of

that drunken beach debauchery
for me. I was above all that. I was
a pampered college student and I
needed to give back. I drove 11 hours
with two-dozen likeminded stu-
dents to Montezuma Creek, Utah
to paint houses and work with local
students. I slept on the floor of the
high school. I woke up at six every
morning and ate ham sandwich-
es for a week. I did a sweat lodge
beside a freezing river. I learned a
little Navajo. I dripped paint. Iwept
during a ceremonial dance.
My sophomore ghost says I got
plenty, but I don't think I gave much
back.
My junior year, studying abroad
in London, I used the break to trav-
el around Italy. We took a gondola
in venice, hiked to the top of the
Duomo in Florence and danced in
a street carnival in Milan. We saw
Oscar-winner Roberto Benigni at
an Ethiopian restaurant and art
that filled cities. I got a new girl-
friend, and we slept in the same
hostel bunk bed, and in the morn-
ing our backs did not hurt. We
threw coins in the Trevi Fountain
and knew, distantly, that we would
not live forever, but we promised
that we would come back and that
we wouldn't ever forget.
My junior year ghost wonders
when I will be back and how much
cannot be brought back.
My senior year, I finally made
it up to northern California. The
girlfriend was still with me, hav-
ing flown out from New York. We
toured San Francisco and stayed at a
bed and breakfast in Mendocino. We
were told that "Murder, She Wrote,"
was filmed there, and we laughed- a
perfect retirement town for ancient
Angela Lansbury to haunt. We slept
in. We ate breakfast in bed. We read
the complimentary USA Today. We
were adults. We wished we had jobs
after graduation. We talked about if

we would "make it" together, with-
out knowing what that meant. We
agreed that long distance was hard,
but that we couldn't imagine being
apart. We wished we had jobs. We
felt both old and immature. At the
end of the week, her flight to New
York was delayed a day and it felt
like a miracle - one more day that
was not the future.
We are who we
decide to be when
we are told we
can do anything.
My senior year ghost knows that
this was only a temporary reprieve.
The ghost of the future points silent-
ly ahead, knowing that time is the
hardest distance.
I won't wake up on any of these
cold early March mornings with
my life changed. My time for that
has passed. But every year I remem-
ber those four entirely different
escapes, alike only in their enduring
ability to define me. There's plenty
of mythic pressure put on spring
break, on "making memories," on
letting loose and walking as close
to the edge of reason as possible.
Much of it is unwarranted, absurd
and, not infrequently, dangerous.
But spring breaks matter because
we are the choices we've made. We
are adventures we've had and the
chances we've missed. We are the
people we've wanted to help and the
lovers we've left behind. We are who
we decide to be when we are told we
can do anything.

The art task force is absolutely correct
in changing the city's funding. Forty-four
percent of voters supported proposal B in
November, which is a high percentage con-
sidering people's instinctive response to vote
no on ballot proposals. Ann Arbor citizens
are clearly interested in changing the way art
is funded. The task force is emblematic of a
city council that is searching for new ways to
include art in the city and make it an integral
part of the community. These new recom-
mendations ensure that art will better serve
the city's unique needs.
The plan to end the Percent for Art pro-
gram is a responsible decision. Percent for
Art allowed the city to use money on art even
if it didn't have a plan. Now, the city must
design an art project before funding is allo-
cated. This ensures that the city's art projects
are well organized and better funded. The

new ideas for donations from the community
through "crowdfunding" websites like Kick-
starter will help fund the art program, as well
as engage the community.
Finally, the program keeps Ann Arbor
weird. Ann Arbor hosts one of the best sum-
mer art fairs, is home to a prestigious, diverse
university and is a cultural hub in the state
of Michigan. Art deserves to be a focal point
of this city. A new and organized art program
will ensure that Ann Arbor will continue to
thrive culturally, and continue to attract
tourists from around the city and state.
The city's task force has done a superb job
of handling its artistic situation. It has orga-
nized a template that assumes a nuanced and
responsible paradigm for art in Ann Arbor.
The improvement of the art program is a way
of maintaining Ann Arbor's distinct charac-
ter and culture.

Putting Karachi in context

Henrietta Lacks was a woman. She had a
life. She had loves and joys, hardships and
heartaches. She had a family. She had friends,
hobbies, grudges. She held down a job and
polished her toenails.
Rebecca Skloot is also a woman. She lives
the life of an author and journalist, writ-
ing about science and medicine. She, too,
has a family, friends, hobbies, grudges. And
she holds down a job and has polished her
toenails. On Tuesday, she visited the Uni-
versity to discuss her New York Times Best
Seller, "The Immortal Life of Henrietta
Lacks." Framed as a biography of cells and
a story of people, her talk covered aspects of
privacy, tissue ownership and informed con-
sent in medical sciences during the 1950s. But
mostly she talked about Henrietta Lacks.
Henrietta Lacks was born Aug. 1, 1920.
Early in 1951, Lacks began to feel abdominal
and cervical pains. She was diagnosed with
a malignant cervical cancer. She was treat-
ed with radiation, which failed to stop the
spread of the cancer. It eventually metasta-
sized throughout her body. On Oct. 4, 1951,
she died.
Before her death, cell samples from her
cervix were removed by her physician and
given to George Gey without her or her fam-
ily's permission. At the time, permission
for cell and tissue harvesting was neither
required nor typically sought, especially for
such small samples taken during routine pro-
cedures. Gey was requesting every cell and
tissue sample he could because of his interest
in creating an immortalized human cell line
- that is, cells that could be indefinitely cul-
tured. Such a creation would have an incred-
ible impact on biomedical research, as it
would allow for more standardized and rigor-
ous experiments. After many failed attempts,
Gey succeeded in creating this cell line with
Lacks's cancer tissue, still in use today.
The cells Gey created were called "HeLa"
cells, after Henrietta Lacks. For many years,
several textbooks, journal articles and press
reports mistakenly claimed the cells were
named for Helen Lane, Helen Larson and Hen-
rietta Lakes. This error was promulgated partly
because of initial concerns for privacy and part-
ly through a continuation of earlier inaccura-
cies. Indifference to the person they came from
also played a role.
Skloot first learned about HeLa cells in her
community college biology class. She was told
the cells were immortal, came from a woman
who died of cancer and that she was black. She
and many others before her were told these
details as if they were all there was to it. After
all, what was supposed to matter was that these

cells had helped millions, and potentially bil-
lions, of people as a result of biological and
medical breakthroughs.
That was what was supposed to matter - not
the person they were from. That was the story
we knew until Skloot came along.
In the half century between the death of
Lacks and the beginning of Skloot's inves-
tigation, trillions and trillions of HeLa cells
had been grown. For all the good the cells
had done for the world (used to test the polio
vaccine, develop genetic mapping techniques
and understand cancer), very little was
known of the woman who brought them into
it. After a decade of research, Skloot deliv-
ered a book that would tell Lacks's story and
reignite debates in scientific ethics that rage
across the nation.
Debate in scientific ethics is rarely simple.
Typically the scales of moral justification in
science are nuanced with attempts made to
carefully calibrate them to balance the sever-
ity of pain with the potential for progress.
It's not easy and has been constantly refined
as more evidence comes in. But for science
to be self-correcting, it must periodically be
wrong. And sometimes it is.
One such instance that Skloot elaborates
upon throughout her book is the infamous
"Tuskegee syphilis experiment" that spanned
from 1932 to 1972 in which nearly 600 black
men in Alabama were monitored to track the
progression of syphilis in natural environ-
ments. Those that had syphilis (399 of the origi-
nal participants) were never told they had the
disease and were actively prevented from get-
ting treatment. As a result men, women and
children needlessly suffered and died as sacri-
fices at the altar of ethically disgraced science.
Too often we forget that science is just
another thing people do. We forget that scien-
tists are people, no different than others, with
families, friends, hobbies and grudges. Their
job puts them in a unique position of trust, and
this must not be abused. After all, scientists are
people and so are their patients. We must all
communicate with one another honestly and
openly as we go through this life - it's the only
way we'll make it.
The stories of science are the stories of
humanity's place in the universe. But this
only matters insofar as we remember that it
is human beings for which and about whom
these stories are told. So the next time you see
"HeLa lives!" scrawled on the bathroom walls
of a medical research facility, take a moment
to remember that once Henrietta lived.

I was reading the viewpoint by
Omar Mahmood on Monday and
noticed he was quite disappointed
by his visit to Karachi, Pakistan
last summer. He complained that
Karachi, the largest metropolis in
the nation, had lost its indigenous
culture because the people allowed
globalization to corrupt the city. I've
lived in Karachi all my life and my
entire family is from Pakistan. I can
say with certainty that Pakistani
culture is most definitely not "sim-
ply a shameless attempt to be Amer-
ican," as described by Mahmood.
Karachi, and Pakistan as a whole,
may be facing a plethora of crises,
but losing their cultural identity is
not among them.
Firstly, it would be wrong to
judge Pakistani culture based on
the experiences of one summer in
Karachi. If one is to be critical, it's
important to first know about the
history of the city.
Karachi, until the partition of
India in 1947, has historically been
inconsequential and mostly irrel-
evant. It never epitomized Indian
or Pakistani culture. Before the
British colonized India, Kara-
chi was barely even a city. It was
a small fishing village with no
recognizable historic culture or
architecture to put it on the map.
In fact, it wasn't even called Kara-
chi. Burns Road, Frere Hall, Napi-
er Road and Empress Market are
among the city's oldest landmarks.
Doesn't sound very Pakistani, does
it? That's because the British con-
structed these landmarks.
Today, Karachi has grown into
one of the most populous cities in
the world. It's the New York City of
Pakistan - a mixture of many eth-
nicities in a single place. Karachi
never had a cultural identity of its
own. But since so many people from
different backgrounds moved to
Karachi, the many cultures became
somewhat subdued in order to
facilitate communication between

groups of people. What I'm trying
to say is that if you come to Karachi
expecting to be bombarded with
Pakistani culture, you will surely
be disappointed. You will only find
traces of various cultures within the
homes of individuals who choose to
preserve their native heritage.
Mahmood's article showed that
he's aware of Sufi music, poetry and
Qawwalis - all unique to Pakistan
and India. Pakistan has not lost its
culture - you just have to look for it
beyond Karachi. It's like learning all
about the American South and then
going to New York and expecting to
hear Southern accents. It's not going
to happen.
If you visit cities like Lahore or
Multan, you will experience Sufi
culture; you can see the old shrines
and Mughal era architecture. There
are more than 60 languages spoken
in Pakistan, and each region has a
distinct culture. I've visited parts of
the country where even I can't seem
to relate to the culture because I
haven't been exposed to it in Kara-
chi. Pakistan has such vibrant cul-
ture that it would be naive to say
the country has become completely
westernized. The entire culture of
Pakistan is not expressed on the
streets of Karachi.
Yes, in Karachi we have a Texas-
themed restaurant where it's OK
to throw peanuts on the ground. I
will even confess to watching Hol-
lywood movies and listening to Eng-
lish music- that's just a result of
globalization and cultural exchange.
I don't think Mahmood visited the
restaurants I often frequented with
my friends. I can assure you that
you'd find no such places in America.
As for the mall where "the national
language of Urdu was effectively
banned," I've yet to see this. It's also
important to understand that it's not
abnormal for Pakistanis tobe speak-
ing English. After all, English is a
legacy of British rule and has been
absorbed into Pakistani culture.

For Mahmood, I don't think it was
Karachi that was the problem, but
the tour guide.
As technology and communica-
tion develop, we will be exposed to
different cultures around the world
and need to learn to embrace them.
The moment the first flight that
could get you from Karachi to New
York departed was the moment it
became inevitable that Karachi
would open up a Texas-themed res-
taurant. Take a look at Ann Arbor.
I doubt that Ann Arbor had Indian,
Korean and Chinese restaurants in
1905. But the fact that we have them
today doesn't mean that Ann Arbor
has lost its culture.
Despite not being a historically
vibrant city, Karachi does have a
unique culture that isn't necessar-
ily a microcosm of Pakistan or a
shameless imitation of America. If
you want to find the culture of Kara-
chi, you have to look beyond the
shopping malls and Texas-themed
restaurants. Culture isn't defined
by restaurant chains - it's defined
by how you live. It's defined by your
background, the language you speak
and the values and traditions with
which you grow.
Only when I came to America for
college did I realize how different
Pakistani culture is, and I realized
this despite living in Karachi all
my life. I notice it every day when
I don't get authentic Pakistani food
to eat, when I don't hear my aunts
chatting with my grandmother in
Punjabi, when the entire city is dis-
cussing football instead of cricket
and when I can't crack Urdu jokes
with my American friends. The list
of cultural differences is endless.
The effects of globalization should
not be confused with erosion of cul-
ture. Karachi may be suffering a lot
these days, but it's definitely not suf-
fering a loss of culture and hopefully
it never will.

norities as dangerous. This ine his or her own biases.
more draconian laws for "Most police officers come to

the job with noble reasons try-
ing to do the right thing, but like
every other professions, we all
have our biases," Clayton said.
"So the question becomes: Do our
biases influence the decisions we
make?"
When Clayton heard that a
study conducted on the New Jer-
sey turnpike showed that blacks
were disproportionately targeted
for traffic stops, he commissioned
a similar study in Washtenaw
County, the first study of its kind
in a rural area. The results were
less skewed than in New Jersey,
but minorities were still tar-
geted more than a fair statistical
breakdown would allow. Clayton
responded by calling in experts to
teach a fair and impartial policing
class to his entire staff.
Clayton stressed that his com-
mitment isn't a black versus white
dichotomy. He aims to eliminate
biases, even implicit ones, toward
any group of individuals.
As an African American and a
law enforcement official, Clayton
brings a unique perspective to the
conversation. He recalls growing
up in the South with family mem-
bers who had felt the acute sting
of racial prejudice.
"I grew up with a grandfa-
ther telling me stories about the
marches he went on and about
how law enforcement used to sic
dogs on them," Clayton said. "In
some ways, I'm in a profession
that my grandfather did not have
any love for. I think change comes
in many different ways. You can
be an external force for change or
an internal force for change."
Clayton added: "I representlaw
enforcement, but I also represent
a community that has felt target-
ed by law enforcement at times."
The participants at the Race
and the Legal System have con-
versations that run the gamut
from academic study of racial
disparity, to legal expertise, to
law enforcement experience.
A former inmate who has been
through the system will also
discuss his experiences. Clay-
ton feels that conversations with
people from a multitude of per-
spectives can lead to positive
change.
"Sometimes you can't see
what you needto change if you're
right in the middle of it," Clayton
said. "I know I have blind spots,
I know they have blind spots.
Hopefully they can light some of
the blind spots that I have."

Awkward family photos.
The 'Downton' empire
might soon crumble

By GRACE PROSNIEWSKI
For the Daily
This season, "Downton
Abbey" became a certifiable
empire. Season three saw soar-
ing worldwide viewership, doz-
ens of nominations and awards
and an abundance of merchan-
dise. It seems like everyone's
obsessed with the Crawleys and
for good reason. "Downton" is
beautifully shot, impeccably
acted and deals with themes
relevant to modern audiences.
However, I must admit I'm
afraid for season four as "Down-
ton" might reach an uninten-
tional level of meta: an empire in
decline.
Spoiler alert! Since Ameri-
can audiences have now caught
up to British viewers (seriously
though, the Internet, check
it out), we all know about the
untimely deaths of Sybil and
Matthew Crawley. My gut
reaction, as I assume was the
case with many of my fellow
"Downton"-ers, was to hatch a
plan to travel to England, kidnap
Julian Fellowes and force him to
write an alternative script.
Others may be thinking, "So
what? Characters get killed off
all the time." That's true. But
death, just like any other plot
device, should be purposeful.
And these two deaths, specifi-
cally Matthew's, seem artificial.
I mean, really, how many times
is a Crawley going to die after
viewing their newborn child?
The characters, and the fans,
deserve better than that.
What's maddening here is
that there's so much left undone.

'Wit' to question
issues of life, death

Commanding
play confronts
challenging roles
By PAIGE PFLEGER
Daily Arts Writer
Pulitzer Prize-winning play
"Wit" centers on the life of Viv-
ian Bearing, a poetry professor
diagnosed with
stage IV meta- it
static ovar-
ian cancer. It Thursday and
follows her Friday at 7
through the and11 p.m.
years of her life Basement Arts
in flashbacks
and memo- Free
ries. The play,
selected by
director and LSA senior Billy
Jackson, portrays an extremely
powerful plot and delves into
how the importance of a person's
life is measured posthumously.
"I was drawn to this show in
particular because I didn't really
understand it right away," Jack-
son explained. "It was something
I really struggled to understand,
and I thought it was really aim-
ing for something greater than
some of the experiences I've had
so far. It's an incredibly moving
show, and the emotional arc of it.
is really awesome."
School of Music, Theatre &
Dance senior Jane Bruce was
cast in the lead role as Vivian.
The part is challenging due to the
extreme presence needed to por-

tray such an emotional character.
"She's on stage nonstop, no
scene or act breaks, just acting
for two hours straight," Jack-
son said. "She is there the whole
time, engaged in it, which I think
is crazy. She is such a talented
individual, and she's really doing
everything possible to do this
role justice."
As a senior preparing for
graduation, Bruce relates to the
element of change in the show
- the idea that everything even-
tually draws to a close - and
like Vivian Bearing, Bruce isn't
entirely sure what lies beyond
this ending.
"Vivian is a woman who has
always relied on her intelligence
and her quest for perfection as
a means of being satisfied with
her life," Bruce said. "But when
she is faced with her death and
forced to accept the fact that
she will die, she works through
what exactly her life has meant
as a means of trying to find some
final meaning. In doing so, she
makes a discovery about life that
she didn't see before."
Another challenge facing
Bruce is that Vivian has to deal
with the breakdown of barriers a
person deals with when close to
death.
"I think what I like about Viv-
ian is her ability to find the irony
in life, find the humor, find the
wit," Bruce said. "She tries to
be tough as a teacher and with
her intellect and also in going
through the therapy. ... But slow-
ly her layers and her walls come

down, and she is forced to accept
what is on the inside."
The ages of the characters in
the show also pose a challenge
for this student production
because the majority of the cen-
tral characters are 50 or older.
Bruce is challenged not only by
playing an older woman, but also
by the intrinsically intellectual
nature of Vivian.
"I like the challenge," Bruce
said. "It's taught me to see
myself differently, see the world
differently and see life and death
differently. It's not that I person-
ally have all the answers. I am
seeing through a different set of
lenses, and it's a very thought-
provoking process."
Jackson, who is majoring
in Screen Arts and Culture, is
excited to see how the show
and his directing come to frui-
tion. Grateful for a hardworking
cast and crew, both Jackson and
Bruce feel fortunate to be end-
ing their undergraduate careers
with this show in particular.
"It's good drama, good the-
ater, good storytelling," Jackson
said. "It's a very human show
that isn't about single moments.
It's about the sum total of a wom-
an's life being revealed before
our eyes, and how she reaches
a conclusion - what does she
add up to? What is the sum total
of her life? Whether we're 50
years away or five days, what
we are doing here is defined by
an end boundary. And 'Wit' is
what happens when a woman is
pushed right up to that point."

"What went through my
mind when I fell down?" Jenni-
fer Lawrence, recent Academy
Award-winner for Best Actress,
isn't afraid to be honest. "A bad
word that I can't say that starts
with 'F.'
Though her fall and Oscar-
worthy recovery have been a hot
topic these past few days, J-Law
has been rocking the chill, no-
fucks-given attitude a long time
before her run in with the stairs.
As the second-youngest
recipient of an Academy Award
for Best Actress, a question was
posed to Lawrence at the post-
Oscars press interviews:
"Do you think you've peaked
too early?"
J-Law fearlessly held her
own, answering that she hadn't
even worried about it, and now
she's bound to, earning laughs

from the crowd. This is the rea-
son people want to be her best
friend - she's the type of girl
you'd want to roadtrip with,
have at your party to crack
jokes and laugh at stupid things
with. And though the question
is clumsy, it's the way Lawrence
handled it that makes her relat-
able: She's honest in a way many
famous people aren't.
Celebrities are mostly broken
into two categories: Those that
are poised, humbled by their
successes and keep their per-
sonal life and thoughts private,
and those that are anti-fame,
critical of the mainstream
success and feel awkward on
the red carpet. And while it's
always fun to watch someone
bash on the glamour and glitz of
Hollywood, it's a lot more inter-
esting to see someone genuinely
working through the details of
stardom.
As an actress, Lawrence

started out on TBS "The Bill
Engvall Show," for which she
received a Young Artist Award.
She went on to guest star in
various TV shows and star in
independently acclaimed films"
until her role as Ree Dolly in
"Winter's Bone." Nominated
for an Academy Award for Best
Actress, J-Law went on to star
in "X-Men: First Class," "The
Hunger Games" and "Silver
Linings Playbook," among oth-
ers.
As someone with years of liv-
ing experience, I can guarantee
you there are days all I want
to do is sit around, watch bad
TV and eat. And I'd prefer to
do it pants-less. And I'm pretty
sure J-Law would be down for
the same kind of day; she's an
actress because that's her career
of choice, and so far, it doesn't
seem to be hindering her ability
to be herself in interviews, press
conferences and movie pre-
mieres. She's just J-Law, rocking
out, every day.
And while 22 is quite young
to receive an Academy Award, *
it's not underserved. While it's
true some actors and actresses
get by on reputation and per-
sona, J-Law is a solid performer
that also happens to like eating
McDonald's. A lot.
We all just
want to hang
out with J-Law
without pants.
Ultimately, my obsession
with her stems from her real-
ness; I don't find her fake, phony,
rehearsed or produced. I believe
her when she says in order to
get ready for a premiere she ate
French fries and laid in bed until
three. I laughed when she talked
about being followed by paparaz-
zi only to realize she wasn't. I
watch her interviews and under-
stand why she makes funny faces
because there's no way I'd be
able to sit and answer questions
for hours on end without some
kind of entertainment. She's not
refined, but she's real. And that's
cool, I dig it. It's endearing to
hear her talk about how nervous
and fan-girl she gets when talk-
ing to famous actors and actress-
es. She's living out her life any
20-year-old girl would if she was
thrust into fame.
When asked about her down-
to-earth personality at the
world premiere of "The Hunger
Games," J-Law responded with,
"I'm just dumb and blurt every-
thing out! It's not - that's not
what it is at all. Everybody tries
to think it's a positive thing but
it's not. It's not."
And even though it might not
be on purpose, it's pretty awe-
some to hear someone talking
about how excited they are to
sleep rather than jump right into
another movie.

microscopic tumor cells that may
have escaped from the (original)
tumors, so that they don't come
back."
To determine the effectiveness
of Herceptin on HER2-negative
patients, University research-
ers analyzed medical data from
HER2-negative patients who
had been incorrectly diagnosed
as positive for the protein. Those
studies were supposed to be lim-
ited to HER2-positive patients.
However, researchers realized
that several of the patients didn't
actually have the HER2 gene,
and had gotten Herceptin by
mistake.
After analyzing the data from
these women, the researchers
found that the HER2-negative
patients showed similarly favor-
able results to the HER2-postive
patients, contradicting what was
formerly understood about the
drug.
The HER2 protein, formally
known as Human Epidermal
growth factor Receptor-2, is
encoded by the human gene
controlling growth. In HER2-
positive patients, the protein is
over-expressed in breast can-
cer stem cells, leading to tumor
growth.
"In many of these women,
although the assay says they are
HER2-negative, the protein for
the HER2 gene is still expressed
in a small population of cells in
the tumor," Wicha said.
Breast cancer stem cells only
account for 1 to 5 percent of
cancerous cells in an afflicted
individual. Current radiation
treatments, although effective in
destroying many cancerous cells,
are not strong enough to destroy
stem cells, allowing tumors to
regenerate unless the patient has

them. And our excellence goes far
beyond basketball and football."
The budget outlines a 2-percent
increase in funds for the state's
" public colleges and universities
contingent on meeting state stan-
dards and limiting tuition hikes.
Additionally, the increase in
higher education allocations will
be included as part of the baseline
funding for budget increases or
* decreases in the years to come.
Coleman and other university
presidents areinvited totestify before
the committee each year after the
governor releases the state's budget.
In the context oflooming budget
decisions, Coleman detailed the
University's efforts to cut costs and
maintain affordable tuition while
expanding the quality of educa-
tional opportunities.
Coleman said for many students,
the cost of attending the Univer-
sity is less than it was four years
ago and the U.S. Department of
Education rated the University
as an institution with one of the
slowest rates of growth in cost of
attendance. She also said the Uni-
versityhas cut $235 million in costs
over the past decade, all while con-
tinuing to recruit the best faculty,
launch new academic initiatives

and uphold a strong commitment
to financial aid.
"Only one (University) bud-
get item is sacrosanct and that
is financial aid; here we are add-
ing dollars," Coleman said. "This
year alone, we invested $137 mil-

constant treatment.
Currently, the researchers are
conducting a one-year clinical
trial to test the use of Herceptin
in HER2-negative patients.
"If we're right, it could save
many thousands of women's
lives," Wicha said.
Until the results of the trial
are established, the researchers
are not recommending use of the
drug on patients who don't have
the protein, despite the encour-
aging indicators.
Last Friday, the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration approved
Kadcyla for treatment on HER2-
positive patients with late stage,
metastatic breast cancer. Kad-
cyla is comprised of Herceptin,
which targets the HER2-positive
cells, and DM1, a compound that
inhibits cell replication.
"It may be even more effective
at knocking out these stem cells
because it basically targets the
chemotherapy right to the stem
cells," Wicha said.
Kadcyla, the fourth FDA-
approved product for the treat-
ment of HER2-postive patients
with late stage breast cancer, is
currently produced by Genen-
tech, a subsidiary of Roche, the
Swiss-based pharmaceutical
company. Despite promising
results in the testing phase,
the drug carries a wide array
of side effects, including pos-
sible liver toxicity, heart toxic-
ity and death, according to the
FDA.
Despite the recent University
findings, a spokesperson for the
FDA wrote in an e-mail that the
recent approval is unrelated to
the research, because Kadcyla
is not currently approved for use
on HER2-negative patients.
However, Wicha said the
University hopes to participate
in a national clinical trial test-
ing Kadcyla on HER2-negaitve
patients later this year.
lion for financial aid. We are very,
very deliberate when targeting
savings on campus - the kind of
precision you might experience in
an advanced course in nano-engi-
neering or microsurgery."
Discussing the significance of
support from alumni donors, Cole-
man said while the administration
has not yet set a goal for the Uni-
versity's next capital campaign, the
effort will focus on financial aid.
"I do not want to lose a single

someone who one day may unlock
the mysteries of Alzheimer's or
develop the next-best computer
technology," Coleman said. "I
don't want our best and brightest
to forgo the University of Michi-
gan because of perceived costs."
With four years until the Uni-
versity's bicentennial in 2017,
Coleman said the anniversary
provides an opportunity to reas-
sert the crucial nature of public
higher education in the state's
consciousness.
"The high-growth jobs of the
future - the industries that will
push our state forward - will
require higher education degrees
or specialized training," Coleman
said. "And a university is specifi-
cally designed to challenge young
people, build their skills and
develop critical thinking so they

can address the challenges and
problems of the day."
University spokesman Rick
Fitzgerald said the remarks also
provided Coleman the opportu-
nity to further strengthen the
relationship between universities
and state legislators.

REPORT
From Page 1A
condition of enrollment - details
rules and procedures University
students must follow. The state-
ment explicitly lays out 21 broad
categories of violations, such as
"illegally possessing or using
alcohol" and "sexually assaulting
another person." Not all viola-
tions are legal offenses.
OSCR investigates, determines
guilt and sentences individuals
who violate all non-academic vio-
lations of the statement, such as
destructionofproperty. OSCRcan
sentence individuals to a variety
of non-legal punishments, such
as suspension from the Univer-
sity and substance abuse classes.
In cases in which police are also
investigating, OSCR's punish-
ments are independent from any
legal consequences that may be
handed down by the criminal jus-
tice system.
In cases of sexual nature, such
as sexual harassment or stalking,
OSCR refers cases to the Univer-
sity's Office of Institutional Equity
for investigation. If guilt is deter-
mined by OIE, an appropriate sen-
tencing is handed down by OSCR.
The report covers violations
between July 1, 2011 and June 30,
2012 and lists all reported viola-
tions of the statement, includ-
ing cases where the student was
eventually found not guilty.
However, University officials
say there is no evidence to indi-
cate an increase of sexual mis-
conduct on campus. While the
timeframe is different - calen-
dar year versus academic year
- there were decreases in both
sexual assaults reported to Uni-
versity Police and the Sexual
Assault and Awareness Center
between 2010 and 2011, accord-
ing to the University's Annual
Security Report.
In April 2011, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education asked colleges
nationwide to update their sexu-

al misconduct policies to better
comply with Title IX, a federal
statute that forbids sexual dis-
crimination at universities that
receive federal funding.
Under the former sexual mis-
conduct policy, individuals who
reported sex crimes had to file
a formal complaint in order for
OSCR to investigate. The interim
policy, implemented on Aug. 19,
requires the University to inves-
tigate all claims of sexual inis-
conduct it receives. A permanent
policy is expected to be imple-
mented later this calendar year.
The interim policy states that
sexual misconduct allegations
that "become known to the Uni-
versity" must go through the
investigative process.
Currently, staff and faculty
members are encouraged, but not
required, to report sexual mis-
conduct allegations to the Univer-
sity. OSCR Director Jay Wilgus
said this might change in the per-
manent policy, which mayoutline
which employees are responsible
for reporting. Currently, some
managerial positions and security
personnel are already required to
report allegations.
The Sexual Assault Prevention
and Awareness Center, Counsel-
ing and Psychological Services,
and the University's Office of the
Ombuds are the only completely
confidential resources available
for discussing sexual miscon-
duct. Communication to other
University affiliated employ-
ees, such as residential advisors,
could be reported to OSCR.
Of the 38 individuals implicat-
ed in sexual assault violations, six
were found responsible and seven
were found not responsible.
Nineteen cases were not com-
pleted because of a lack of infor-
mation regarding the incidents.
Because of the interim policy,
University officials must now
attempt to investigate any sex-
ual misconduct it learns about
even if it knows very little. Many
times OSCR might learn of pos-

sible sexual misconduct but not
obtain enough information to
have a conclusive outcome, such
as cases in which the survivor
didn't see the attacker's face.
In the remaining six cases,
the accused was a University
employee or an individual unaf-
filiated with the University.
OSCR also handles reports of
sexual harassment. In two of the
24 reported sexual harassment
violations individuals were found
responsible, five were found not
responsible and13 cases were closed
pending additional information.
After it is determined that the
University fulfilled its obliga-
tions per Title IX, the unsolved
cases of sexual misconduct will
remain closed unless new infor-
mation is brought forward.
SAPAC Director Holly Rid-
er-Milkovich said this process
shows that the University takes
sexual misconduct seriously.
"It's important for our commu-
nity to be able to demonstrate that
we take every matter seriously,that
we review them with vigor and
that we hold students accountable
whenever it is appropriate to do
so," Rider-Milkovich said. "That is
an important message to send, and
it does mean that we have a safer
communitybecause of it."
Rider-Milkovich said she
hopes one day every survivor of
sexual assault will feel comfort-
able with coming forward and
getting the help they need.
"Do I think that these num-
bers reflect the full nature of
sexual assault that's happening
on campus? No, I don't think
we're there yet. I think that the
numbers would be much higher,"
Rider-Milkovich said. "A goal for
us to strive towards is for every
person who experiences sexual
misconduct on our campus to feel
the safety and the support from
the community to be able to bring
forward these matters and seek
justice, but we're not there yet."
There was a threefold increase
in the number of reported viola-

tions concerning stealing, van-
dalizing or destroying property
- from nine cases to 21 - and the
number of reported stalking cases
increased from three to nine.OSCR
reported nine violent offenses that
were of non-sexual nature.
Almost 75 percent of violations
reported to OSCR were alcohol or
drug-related. In addition to these
common violations, students
were investigated for several
other infractions, including com-
puter violations, tampering with
fire equipment and identity theft.
There were 38 possible state-
ment violations of sexual assault
reported to OSCR - compared
to two in the prior academic year
- and 24 reported statement
violations of sexual harassment,
compared to one violation in the
prior academic year.
In contrast to the sexual
assaults and harassment, more
than 95 percent of those accused
in alcohol related cases were
found guilty. Wilgus said this
might have to do with the sever-
ity of the accusations and the
vast majority of those accused of
alcohol violations immediately
accept responsibility.
Possible punishments include
an educational workshop on
alcohol, a reflective essay, a no-
contact order and even full expul-
sion from the University. During
the 2011 to 2012 academic year,
only four students were suspend-
ed for a semester or longer, but
none were expelled. Out of the
764 punishments handed down
that year, the vast majority were
classes, educational projects and
"tasks designed to benefit the
community." There were 73 disci-
plinary probation andsix cases of
restitution for damage or injury.
Wilgus said OSCR strives to
ensure that the punishment meets
the statement violation severity
and that because some of the vio-
lations are broad, punishments
can vary widely. OSCR did not
release the breakdown of punish-
ments for specific violations.


RESEARCH
From Page 1A
lyst behind the change. Hold-
ren noted that it also reflects
input from the scientific and
publishing community.
University researchers will
not have to make a major tran-
sition to accommodate the
new policy, as journal publish-
ers will shoulder the majority
of "hiccups" in transitioning
to the new system, Dean of
Libraries Paul Courant said.
"The worst thing in the
world is when there's a new
requirement and nobody
knows how to fulfill it," Cou-
rant said. "(The new require-
ment) quite quickly becomes
a routine. They grumble about
it for a little while, then they
figure out how to do it, and life
goes on."
Publishers will have to
determine what format to
transfer the works into, who
will be in charge of publicizing
the research and other admin-
istrative questions. Courant
expects costs would be mini-
mal.
In 2008, the National Insti-
tute of Health mandated that
all research it funds be accessed
publicly on PubMed Central, its
digital archive. Jane Blumen-
thal, director of the Taubman
Health Sciences Library, said
researchers became comfort-

able with the process of depos-
iting their papers into PubMed
within a year.
She said the NIH Public
Access Policy had no major
issues; it simply had to be
adopted by researchers. She
also predicts the second policy
change in publicizing will be
more efficiently implemented.
"It's going to be easier and
go smoother because they
will learn from the experi-
ences NIH had," Blumenthal
said. "They see how NIH did
it and they're not starting from
scratch."
Courant said this policy is a
step forward for open educa-
tion.
"Many people who are not
attached to universities have
really no access at all to the
quite remarkable work done
here and hundreds of other
places," Courant said. "Now
they will."
"I wouldn't describe it as
a burden," Blumenthal said.
"It's not as onerous as prepar-
ing a journal and submitting it
for publication. This is just one
extra step on the end of that."
Stephen Forrest, the Uni-
versity's vice president for
research, said requiring that
research be released to the
public was a natural move.
"(The public) gets the infor-
mation sooner, free of charge
and, after all, they have paid
for it."

he collected TV/Radio:
but rather by Big Ten Net-
the minutes he work
spent on the
floor - the 17 minutes he played
was the first time he's logged dou-

ble-digit minutes in a month.
Hampered by a nagging ankle
injury suffered in late January,
Morgan spent the majority of his
time on the bench during Michi-
gan's previous six contests. But
his ability to play extended min-
utes is a promising sign as the
fourth-ranked Wolverines pre-
pare to play Penn State (0-14 Big
Ten, 8-18 overall) on Wednesday.
The Wolverines (9-4, 22-4) held
Illinois without an offensive
board in the second half Sunday
and outscored the Illini 45-20
when Morgan was on the court.
"We had been very hopeful
coming out of this mini-camp
that he would be back to his old
self - he wasn't," said Michigan
coach John Beilein after the vic-
tory on Sunday. "He played very
well on the scout team on a few
occasions, and I said 'we're going
use him and see what he does.'
And right from the get-go, I knew
that even if he's not 100 percent,
he's better than he's been."
In Michigan's 79-71 victory
against Penn State on Feb. 17,
Morgan was inserted back into
the starting lineup for the first
time since he injured his ankle.
But after struggling to keep up

with the Nittany Lions' ball-
screen-heavy offense, Beilein
elected to play him just nine min-
utes.
Against Illinois, another team
with a ball-screen-heavy offense,
his defensive mobility appeared
much improved and his presence
on the court was a big boost for
the Wolverines. He could be seen
directing the defensive lines in
front ofhim, and even thoughhe'd
been playing limited minutes, his
anticipation in the passing lanes
and on help defense was much
quicker than that of the younger,
more inexperienced bigs.
"Jordan Morgan looked like
he was 99.9 percent today, so that
was good,"sophomore guard Trey
Burke said. "Hopefully he will be
all the way back on Wednesday."
Though the Nittany Lions
shouldn't pose much of a problem
- they're winless in the confer-
ence and losers of their past 14
contests - they're improving as
the season continues, and it's only
a matter of time before they pick
up avictory. Penn Statehaslostits
last three games by an average of
five points.
The Nittany Lions are led by
swingman D.J. Newbill. The

sophomore guard is averaging
15.8 points, 5.6 rebounds and four
assists a game.
Michigan knows firsthand that
if it relaxes, Penn State will be
able to play a competitive game.
In the last matchup between the
two teams in Ann Arbor, the Wol-
verines came out a little flat and
the Nittany Lions took advantage.
They shot 46 percent in the first
half and were tied with Michi-
gan at the end of the first. The
Wolverines needed an aggressive
second half to pull out the victory
and finished the game connect-
ing on 27 of their 35 free-throw
attempts.
In that contest, Burke led the
Wolverines with 29 points and
five assists. Over his past three
games, the floor general is aver-
aging more than 24 points and
five assists, shooting better than
60 percent from the floor, includ-
ing knocking down eight of his
12 attempts from beyond the arc.
He's also turned the ball over just
three times over that stretch.
"He's playing the game the
right way," Beilein said. "He has
this confidence about when it's
time for himto go in and get buck-
ets or shoot a three."

has started the
dual-match sea-
son strong and has been proven
tough to beat - having defeated
Michigan's rivals such as Illinois
and Minnesota.
"If (playing tough matches)

doesn't break you, it only makes
you stronger," said Michigan
coach Bruce Berque. "The only
way we can improve as a team
is by playing strong competition
every match and getting exposed
in an ideal way."
Playing tougher, highly rated
opponents will likely help Michi-
gan players increase their nation-
al rankings as such matchups
help create more opportunities
for the team to improve. Schedule
strength is the greatest determi-
nant in ITA college rankings.
"They have always been a team
that consistently qualifies for the
Sweet 16," Berque said. "They
have a lot of experience on their
team right now. They have a lot of
international players who have a
lot of experience. We are expect-
ing another very tough match."
Michigan will look to its dou-
bles to set the tone early. The
Wolverines have won the doubles

as Michigan is 4-1 when it wins

Senior Evan King and junior
Shaun Bernstein own a 5-1 record
at the No. 1 doubles spot. Michi-
gan will also expect strong play
from redshirt sophomore Justin
Rossi, a steady contributor in the
doubles lineup. The rising sopho-
more tandem of Michael Zhu
and Alex Petrone has also shown
promise at the No. 3 spot with its
fusion of differentplaying styles.
King will look to extend his
singles winning streak to 11
matches, and a victory versus
Tulsa's No. 52 Japie De Klerk
would be extra special. Not only
would this be King's 99th victory
as a Wolverine, but it would also
move him into a tie with Michael
Leach (1979-82) for fifth place in
the program's history in career
victories.
A win versus Tulsa could give
the Wolverines much-needed
momentum as they close in on the
start of the Big Ten season.
"Our guys want (to play tough
competition)," Berque said. "They
think of themselves as a team
who ran comnete against the best


teams, and we have an opportu-
nity to show our strength against
Tulsa."

SEVILLE, Spain -
'm usually, almost always right. The
phrase, now a long-forgotten joke with
friends, serves as my secret, overconfi-
dent mantra.
I also firmly believe that my way is the
right way, and that's all there is to it. This
may stem from 5 years as an only child, my
streak of stereotypical American egocen-
trism or an overwatered seed of self-confi-
dence, but in my experience it's because in
fact, I'm usually almost always right.
I write this rambling piece sitting on my
rooftop terrace in Seville, Spain. I'm basking
in the sun, enjoying a view of orange trees
and wondering how, like everyone promises,
Seville can get even better in the spring.
And here I'll pause for a moment and let
you be jealous.
Now, as I'm enjoying tapas, I hear a faint
voice in the back of my head. It's getting
stronger as our pitcher of sangria steadily
disappears and it's whispering "What do you
think of your way now?"
This voice has a point. My way of life in
the States has never had the time or the
appropriate weather to include lounging on
a rooftop terrace. My way has never includ-
ed tapas. The reminders continue with the
beautiful architecture that surrounds me
and the romantic Spanish language I am
slowly re-learning. The sangria voice is
breaking down my precious "right way," as
it describes the buzz in the city when the
Sevilla Fdtbol Club is playing and the heav-
enly 3-hour period of each day known as
siesta when shops close and you're allowed,
even expected, to relax and do absolutely
nothing.
As usual, I have a few rebuttal arguments.
Being constantly surrounded by a cloud of
secondhand cigarette smoke isn't exactly

pleasant and my blue eyes drawing stares
like a green shirt on Michigan game day isn't
my favorite either.
But I think the sangria voice has me beat
in this argument. It may be odd to eat lunch
at four and dinner at 1Obut that doesn't make
the Sevillan way wrong.
At home, I can reject any way I don'tagree
with. And this, my friends, is the real reason
I have been usually almost always right for
the last 20 years. But here, for the first time,
I have been forced to accept and learn a new
way without retreating comfortably back to
my own. Whether it fits in my old way or not,
I now have to usea 24-hour clock.
But, as it turns out, I happen to like it. I'll
happily discard my Michigan-bred habit of
carrying mittens, sunglasses and an umbrel-
la with me at all times thanks to the ever-
present southern Spanish sun.
Of course, no one likes being wrong, and
I'm definitely no exception, but in the short
month I've spent abroad, I've rather enjoyed
living this very not-my-way lifestyle. So I
have to say, though this is hard for me, I've
learned I'm not always right. And I'm prob-
ably not usually almost always right either,
even when it comes to the big stuff. e I never
gave another way a chance. Keeping an open
mind, I could have been napping every day
for years, or discovering the 2,000 delicious
uses for olive oil I know now.
You just read 800 words hoping to con-
vince you, yet again, that broadening your
horizons and life views is an essential part of
life. I'll probably always hold onto my secret
mantra, but discovering the merit of another
way might just demote me to: occasionally
almost always right.

ROME -
t was 2:20 p.m., and my class started
at 2 p.m. We were supposed to meet
in St. Peter's Square in front of the
Vatican, but amidst all of the other groups
of 15 or so people I couldn't find anyone.
that looked familiar. I panicked. I tried
calling my professor - no answer. I tried
calling two of my classmates - no answer.
I tried calling my host institution - no
help. So I continued running around St.
Peter's Square trying to find my class. This
episode of hysteria lasted until 2:45 p.m.,
when I finally gave up and came to terms
with the fact that I had just completely
missed my class.
After a big sigh, I panned the square
in front of me. How had I not noticed the
countless news crews stationed through-
out the area? I walked up to a nearby
newswoman and asked her, in very broken
Italian, what happened. She didn't speak
English, but she probably said something
along the lines of, "The Pope resigned. The
Pope resigned for the first time in almost
six centuries."
My first thought was, why? I asked
another reporter who spoke English. "The
official reason is health." Health ... that's
all? This answer left me with so many
looming questions, but when I asked my
professor and Italian classmates what they
thought, they seemed satisfied with the
simple explanation. Congress required
President Bill Clinton to testify about his
marital affair under oath. But the leader of
the Vatican state can resign his position by
citing health?
This was not the first time that I was
confused by the conservatism I experi-
enced in Italy. Though the Vatican became
an official and separate state from Italy

through the Lateran Treaty of 1929, the
church still exerts immense influence
over the country, and Rome specifically. In
the first three weeks I have spent here in
Rome, I have become increasingly aware
of this conservative influence.
In my- Italian language course that
day, we learned how to say the names of a
number of different professions in Italian.
Almost all professions can be used with
both masculine and feminine articles,
excepta few: doctor, architect, and lawyer,
for example.
I raised my hand and asked my teacher
what would stop a woman from using the
feminine article? Had Italian women never
protested for this right? She explained
that there had been a movement for exact-
ly this, but it simply lost momentum due to
the Italian language's inherent conserva-
tism. She then continued on with the class,
seemingly unaware of how confusing this
was for her American students.
What seems paradoxical to me is that
every Italian I talk to lauds Americans for
their election of President Barack Obama.
They did not remark on the president's
specific policies, but on what he symboliz-
es: progressivism. From how I understand
it, Obama represents the future that many
Italians hope their country will end up
with amid the nation's political turmoil.
This weeks elections have yet to result
in a stable coalition. Will the status quo
change? I am here amidst not one, but two
selections of new leaders: Italy and the
Vatican state. Where will the course of
history steer next?

Observations of a North African kingdom
by Jacob Axelrad

RABAT, Morocco -
O n January 26, I boarded a plane
at Los Angeles Airport and flew
to Rabat, Morocco, the country's
capital. Since then, I've been living and
studying in a country that, until a few
months ago, I knew little aside from the
fact that its largest city, Casablanca, is the
namesake of a classic Hollywood movie.
I'm staying with a host family in Rabat's
Old Medina (old city), a city filled with
mazes of tiny streets, street vendors and
motorcyclists who pass so close to your
limbs it seems they're trying to remove
one of them in the process. I take classes
at the Center for Cross Cultural Learning,
m a private institution started by Moroccan
academics that provides classes on Moroc-
can language, culture, art and history.
Since I'm not qualified to write about
subjects like politics or culture, and since
I haven't (yet) visited many major tourist
destinations, I've assembled a mishmash
of observations, encounters and thoughts
that have been my last 20 days in this very
old kingdom.
English lurks beneath the surface
Sometimes, I've noticed, Moroccans
will do this thing where when I'll ask for
directions on the street - throwing out the
three French words and one Arabic word
I know, flailing my arms in some kind of
crash-and-burn game of charades, desper-
ately trying to communicate - they'll kind
of quietly nod, not really saying anything.
Then after, say, three or four minutes,
hey'll finally point me in the right direc-
ion, at which point I thank them profusely
for putting up with my ignorant Ameri-
canness. "No problem," they might say, or
"Don't worry about it. You're welcome."
I could see how this could be funny from
their end, letting the American make a fool
of himself.-I hope they have a good laugh
at my expense. Really,It doesn't bother me
at all. Seriously, I'm fine with it. It's all cool,
ok guys!
Globalization is weird
I can't seem to walk down the streets
of the old medina without hearing PSY's
"Gangnam Style" blasting from a shop-
keeper's speakers. Yet I wonder: Is the
o song really that good? Does it honestly
deserve the cross-cultural prominence it's
garnered? I guess the evidence speaks for
itself.
Country of contrasts
Keep in mind I've been in this coun-
try long enough tojustifiably -say many

Moroccan drivers drive as though you,
personally, are responsible for any and all
of their problems, and that can be fixed by
injecting sheer terror into your heart. Any
other conclusions on my part would be pre-
mature. That being said, here's a conclu-
sion I feel a bit better about sharing, since
it was told to me by someone who lives
here: "Morocco is a country of contrasts,"
my friend said as we walked through the
two-year-old Morocco mall in Casablanca,
a place that not only holds such American

ness of this country, there are moments or
days when I do feel down for one reason
or another - I miss my friends and family
back home; I feel like this big, mute, help-
less creature that has to rely on the pity of
others in a culture where I don't know the
customs or language. I'm weighed down
by my guilt as an upper middle-class white
American in this much poorer country -
but then I go around the corner from where
I am living and buy a pizza (not a slice, an
entire margarita pizza) for the equivalent

ize just how little I know about the world
beyond U.S. borders never quite goes away.
"What age is a big deal in Morocco?"
I asked, trying to keep the conversation
from stalling. She paused as she thought
for a moment.
"Well, not 21," she replied. "But not 20
or 18 or 16 either, because your parents are
still paying for everything. Maybe when
you get a job and can pay for things your-
self, then maybe that's a big deal."
At this I wanted to laugh. I wanted to
politely inform her just how wrong she
was. Oppositely in America, being old
enough to spend your parents' money on
booze is clearly reason enough to rejoice
and celebrate. Yet I decided to keep these
thoughts to myself, fearing they could
have been taken the wrong way.
Small comforts
A bed can be the greatest luxury. To
know my host family has provided me with
something so simple yet so essential can
be better than touring the Kasbah, a for-
tress from the 12th century, or visiting the
Hassan Tower, Rabat's famed minaret. At
times, when I'm tired from class lectures,
sightseeing or from smelling the smells
of cooking shawarma mixed with engine
exhaust, I'll lie on my bed and stare at the
walls, patches of plaster peeling from the
ceiling. I try to listen - to the sounds of
my host mother cooking dinner, maybe
couscous or macaroni and cheese - or to
my host brother watching "Homeland" on
his computer dubbed in French. The other
day he jokingly asked me if Americans still
thought all Arab men were terrorists and
all Arab women wore the hijab. Though he
was joking, I thought I sensed a tiny pang of
sadness beneath his laughter. I laughed too,
thinking it the only appropriate response in
that situation.
And, sometimes, I listen to the muezzin
recite the call to prayer, which happens five
times a day, as it emanates from the loud-
speakers of the nearest mosque's minaret.
It's gotten to the point where I barely notice
it anymore. Part of everyday life, know what
I mean? I've been studying Arabic since
I got to Morocco. But I'm far from under-
standing these words, even if their meaning
is relatively simple. They roughly translate
to, "There is no god but God and Muham-
mad is the prophet of God." One day I'd like
to understand these words for myself, with-
out relying on Google translate, even if they
don't make any sense to me. Something,
however, tells me the semantics add up to
more than just linguistic barriers.
