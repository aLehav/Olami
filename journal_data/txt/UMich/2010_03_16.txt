Forums part of
reaccreditation
process conducted
every 10 years
By SUZANNE JACOBS
Daily StaffReporter
In a series of meetings yes-
terday, members of the Higher
Learning Commission - the

organization responsible for con-
ducting the University's reac-
creditation assessment - heard
feedback from members of the
campus community as part of the
process.
Students, faculty and staff at
the University spoke yesterday
with members of the HLC in open-
forum style meetings to discuss
their experience at the University.
The reaccreditation process,
which happens every 10 years,
requires the University to file an

internal report and for members
of the HLC to visit campus. The
assessment evaluates the Uni-
versity on five criteria: mission
and integrity, preparedness for
the future, student learning and
effective teaching, application of
knowledge and engagement out-
side of the classroom. The HLC's
visit began yesterday and will end
tomorrow.
Though the meetings were open
to the public, members of the press
were not permitted to attendthe

forums.
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham told The Michi-
gan Daily that the meetings were
closed to members of the press
because the forums were designed
to provide a private, confidential
atmosphere for faculty, staff and
students to raise concerns.
Cunningham added that repre-
sentatives of the University would
also not be sitting in on the meet-
ings in an official capacity, as a way

ByANNIE GORDON THOMAS

Laura Patterson, associate vice

officer at the University, spoke
to the leading faculty governing

body yesterday about the future of
information technology at the Uni-
versity.
Patterson told members of
the Senate Advisory Commit-
tee on University Affairs that
the University hopes to improve
the technologies used to sup-

especially research at the Univer-
sity through a new program called
Next Gen Michigan.
She said University offi-

ials thought up the program in
response to the "decentralized"
nature of information technol-
ogy at the University, adding that
the University has not offered
much technological support for
researchers.
"We, in some ways, have almost
missed a generation of computing,"
Patterson said.
Patterson noted that other

By KYLE SWANSON
Daily NewsEditor
University officials announced
yesterday that two vacancies in the
University's Office of the General
Counsel have been filled.

According to a press release
distributed by the University yes-
terday attorneys David Masson
and Margaret Marchack will fill
the posts, both called associate
vice president and deputy general
counsel. Marchack's and Masson's
appointments are pending approv-
al from the University's Board of
Regents.
Masson, who has worked for the
University's Office of the General
Counsel since 2000, was promoted
to the post of associate vice presi-
dent and deputy general counsel.

The position was left vacant after
Gloria Hage - who worked in the
role and was interim associate
vice president and deputy gen-
eral counsel at the University of
Michigan Health System - left the
University to become the general
counsel for Eastern Michigan Uni-
versity on March 1.
In his new role, Masson will be
responsible for aiding Vice Presi-
dent and General Counsel Suellyn

versity's legal operations from the

By KYLE SWANSON
Daily News Editor
At their monthly meeting
this Thursday, the University's
Board of Regents will be asked to
approve a recommendation from
University President Mary Sue
Coleman to award six honorary

degrees at this year's spring com-
mencement - including one for
President Barack Obama.
Obama is set to deliverthe com-
mencement address at this year's
graduation and, once approved by
the regents, will
receive a Doctor NOTEBOOK
of Laws degree
while on campus. Obama will
be the third sitting president to
deliver a commencement address
at the University.
In addition to delivering the
commencement address at the

Naval Academy last-year, Obama
spoke at the University of Notre
Dame last spring, where he was
given an honorary degree, and at
Arizona State University, where
he was not given an honorary
degree. Arizona State Universi-
ty's decision not to award Obama
an honorary degree drew criti-
cism from many, but school offi-
cials stood firm in their beliefs
that Obama had not accomplished
enough as president to warrant an
honorary degree.

Sociology lecturer Terence
McGinn thinks of himself as
somewhat of a storyteller, though
not in the traditional sense of the
word.
"It is important to make sure
that each lecture tells a story, in
order to make students active par-
ticipants rather than passive lis-
teners," he said.
In his courses, McGinn said
he focuses heavily on religion
and sociology. But he also spends
time working with students indi-
vidually, both on their course-
work and in writing their honor's
theses.
McGinn teaches three intro-
ductory courses on the cultural
and organizational aspects of soci-
ology and said one of his favorite
things about his job is introducing
students to the field of sociology.
"The thing that I enjoy about
teaching most is when students

who haven't experienced socio-
logical perspective before, experi-
ence it," he said.
In his classes, McGinn empha-
sizes that the most important
thing about sociology is to under-
stand the individual by looking at
the way people are organized in
groups and systems rather than
their personal psychology.
In addition to introductory
courses, McGinn specializes in
religion, education and music
from a sociological view. His
course, The Sociology of Music,
focuses on how social environ-
ments shape the ways in which
individuals interpret and cre-
ate music, whether it is classical
music or contemporary rap.
Having dedicated much time
to his own education, McGinn
said he now makes it a priority to
impart his knowledge and passion
for sociology to his students.

Prior to comingto the Universi-
ty in 1993, McGinn earned under-
graduate degrees in English and
French literature. He later went
on to get his Masters in Business
Administration from the Ross
School of Business in addition to
going on later to earn a Masters of
Divinity and a Ph.D.
After his schooling, McGinn
pursued a career as a Baptist min-
ister for 25 years and then later
worked as a business consultant
for about 25 years.
McGinn, who's favorite spot in
Ann Arbor is the view from the
parking structure located at the
intersection of Ann and Ashley
Streets overlooking the Huron
River, said he's pleased that he
finally got the chance to teach at
the University.
"I am incredibly fortunate to be
teaching at Michigan," he said.

Obama says he is
confident Congress
will approve
health care plan
WASHINGTON (AP) - Dem-
ocratic congressional leaders
showed signs of progress yesterday
in winning anti-abortion Demo-
crats whose votes are pivotal to
President Barack Obama's fiercely
contested remake of the health
care system.
Obamaexpressed optimism Con-
gress would approve his call for
affordable and nearly universal cov-
erage as he pitched his plan on atrip
to Ohio, while Republican Sen. Jim
DeMint of South Carolina, among
the bill's sharpest opponents, said
he was "less confident" than before
that it could be stopped.
"They'd have to be remarkable
people not to fall under the kind of
pressure they'll be under," DeMint
said of rank-and-file Democrats.
The pressure was turned up
Monday as the House Budget
Committee, on a 21-16 vote, took
an essential first step toward the
House vote, which could come next
weekend. Obama and his support-
ers labored in the capital and on Air
Force One.
Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio,
who flew with President Barack
Obama, then walked into an Ohio
senior citizen center with the chief
executive intime tohear avoice from
the audienceyell out, "Voteyes.".
A smiling Obama turned to the
liberal lawmaker and said, "Did you
hear that, Dennis?" Then, turning
back to the audience, he added, "Go
ahead, say that again."
"Vote yes!" came back the reply.
Kucinich, who said later he
remains uncommitted, is one of 37
Democrats currently in the House
who voted against Obama's legis-
lation when it cleared the House
last fall.
In addition, the White House is
laboringto hold the support of sev-
eral other Democrats who voted
for the earlier bill, but only after
first supportingstrict anti-abortion
limits. Those would be altered the
second time around.

At least two have signaled they
are open to supporting the presi-
dent. One of them, Rep. James
Oberstar of Minnesota, is "in the
leaning yes column," said a spokes-
man, John Schadl.
"When we bring the bill to the
floor, then we will have the votes,"
said Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Obama sounded similarly con-
fident in an interview with ABC
News. "I believe we're going to get
the votes, we're going to make this
happen," said the president, who
has traveled to three states and
lobbied numerous lawmakers in
recent days.
Outside interests on both sides
pressured wavering lawmakers.
The National Right to Life Com-
mittee, which opposes abortions,
wrote to lawmakers thatsupportfor
the Senate bill would be a "career-
defining pro-abortion vote."
Union groups and other support-
ers announced a $1.3 million adver-
tising campaign urging 17 House
Democrats to vote for the measure,
and officials at the Service Employ-
ees International Union threatened
to withdraw support from Demo-
crats who vote against the bill if it
loses.
It was more than a year ago that
Obama asked Congress to approve
legislation extending health cover-
age to tens of millions who lack it,
curbing industry practices such as
denying coverage on the basis of
pre-existing medical conditions,
and beginning to slow the growth
of health care nationally. His plan
would require most Americans to
buy health insurance, fine most
who fail to do so and provide gov-
ernment subsidies to help middle-
income earners and the working
poor afford it.
Sweeping legislation seemed to
be on the brink of passage in Janu-
ary, after both houses approved bills
and lawmakers began working out
a final compromise in talks at the
White House. But those efforts were
sidetracked when Republicans won a
special election in Massachusetts -
and with it, the abilityto block avote
on a finalbill in theSenate.
Now, nearly two months later,
lawmakers have embarked on a
two-step approach that requires
the House to approve the measure

passed bytheSenate, despite misgiv-
ings on key provisions. That would
be followed by both houses quickly
passing a second bill that makes
numerous changes to the first. In
the Senate, that second bill would
come to a vote under rules that deny
Republicans the ability to filibuster.
The details of the second, fix-it
measure were closely guarded -
and subject to last-minute chang-
es. In general, officials have said
they would provide more money
for lower-income families unable
to afford health care and states
that already provide above aver-
age coverage for the poor under
Medicaid, as well as improved
prescription drug coverage under
Medicare.
The legislation is expected to
delete a provision in the Senate bill *
that singled out Nebraska for favor-
abletreatmentunder arequirement
to expand Medicaid coverage.
Instead, Democrats may provide
as much as $15 billion to a dozen
states and the District of Columbia,
all of which already provide at least
some of the coverage.
Officials said one sticking point
remained a Senate-passed provi-
sion establishing an independent
commission with authority to force
greater reductions in future Medi-
care payments to providers. House
Democrats want to curtail the
board's powers, but rules may for-
bid any changes under the complex
rules covering the Senate's debate
of the measure.
The cost of the overhaul is
expected to total $950 billion or
more over a decade. It would be
covered by higher taxes on the
wealthy as well as on some health
care providers and high-cost insur-
ance plans.
Several hundred billion dollars
would also be cut from planned
Medicare increases, much of the
burden falling on companies that
provide private coverage to seniors
under Medicare Advantage.
Vice President Joseph Biden also
traveled to Ohio, where he attend-
ed a fundraiser for first-term Rep.
Steve Driehaus, D-Ohio. Driehaus
voted for the House version of a
health card overhaul in November,
and has not yet stated his position
on the new legislation.

NEWS BRIEFS
MINDEN, Mich.
Michigan's only
Wolverine found
dead in Minden
The Wolverine State has lost its
only known wild wolverine.
The body of the 28-pound
female was found Saturday along
a trail in Michigan's Thumb. The
Michigan Department of Natural
Resources and Environment is
conducting tests on the body.
"There's no visible indications
of the cause of death," Arnie Karr,
a wildlife biologist for thi depart-
ment, told The Bay City Times.
"According to the conservation
officers, it did not appear that she
had been dead very long."
Wolverines are the largest land-
living members of the weasel fam-
ily. The aquatic sea otter is larger.
Most North American wolverines
are found in the northern woods
and tundra of Alaska and Canada.
Until six years ago, the last
known Michigan sightings of wol-
verines were in the early 1800s.
Their reputation as fierce hunters
led to their selection as a mascot
for the state and for the University
of Michigan's sports teams.
LOS ANGELES
Ballot bid from pot
advocates gets
rejected in Calif.
Medical marijuana advocates
have failed to gather enough sig-
natures for a ballot measure chal-
lenging a new Los Angeles law
that will shutter hundreds of pot
dispensaries.
Lead organizer Dan Halbert
said Monday his coalition had
gathered about 15,000 voter sig-
natures. The group needed more
than 27,400 by Monday to put the
measure on a ballot.
Halbert's dispensary, the Rain-
forest Collective, is one of hun-
dreds that would have to close
under the new ordinance that caps
the number of pot dispensaries at
70.
About 128 dispensaries that
registered before 2007 would be
exempt.
SAN DIEGO
Toyota dismisses
man 's account of
* runaway Prius
Toyota Motor Corp. dismissed
the story of a man who claimed
his Prius sped out of control on the
California freeway, saying Monday
that its own tests found the car's
gas pedal and backup safety system
were working just fine.
The automaker stopped short
of saying James Sikes had staged a
hoax last week but said his account
did not square with a series of tests
it conducted on the gas-electric
hybrid.
"We have no opinion on his
account, what he's been saying,
other than that the scenario is not
consistent with the technical find-

ings," spokesman Mike Michels
told a press conference.
The episode March 8 was among
the highest-profile headaches Toy-
ota has suffered in recent months.
It recalled more than 8 million cars
and trucks worldwide because gas
pedals can become stuck in the
down position or be snagged by
floor mats. Dozens of Toyota driv-
ers have reported problems even
after their cars were supposedly
fixed.
PARIS
Deals made in
French election
France's Socialists on Monday
worked to secure alliances with
rival leftists going into next week-
end's final round of regional elec-
tions, an attempt to bolster their
front against President Nicolas
Sarkozy's struggling conserva-
tives.
In Sunday's first-round ballot-
ing, Sarkozy's party suffered a
national beating by voters who took
their frustrations over the eco-
nomic crisis to the ballot box and
clearly favored his leftist challeng-
ers for the governments of France's
26 regions. The decisive runoff is
March 21.
Leftist political parties were
scrambling to put together winning
alliances for the final round. Any
party with more than 10 percent
in round one can team up with any
party that won more than 5 percent
and present a joint list of candi-
dates in Sunday's runoff.

fortable voicing their concerns.
"It's private," she said. "It's a
confidential conversation."
Immediately before entering the
open meeting for University fac-
ulty, Celestino Fernandez, chair of
the HLC team, also said the pur-
pose of the meetings was to pro-
vide faculty, staff and students the
chance to speak openly to the HLC
about any comments or concerns
they have about the University.
Fernandez said the job of the
HLC is-to both assess the Uni-
versity and offer suggestions for
improvement.
"We wear two hats - consultants
and evaluators," Fernandez said.
Theresa Reid, executive director
of Arts on Earth, which is a collab-
oration between the School of Art
and Design, the Taubmen College
of Architecture and Urban Plan-
ning and the College of Engineer-
ing, attended the open meeting for
University staff.
Reid said the members of the
HLC asked those in attendance
how they impacted the student

road in this area.
One initiative to bring the Uni-
versity back to the forefront of
information technology and save
money at the same time, Patterson
said, is to combine three informa-
tion technology groups - Michi-
gan Administrative Services,
information technology Security
and Information Technology Cen-
tral Services.
Patterson said the consolidation
of the three organizations "went
live" last April in the form of IT
Services.
"The goal of bringing that orga-
nization together was to look at
how the central groups could
rationalize their services and
cut costs," Patterson told SACUA
members.
The consolidation of the three
groups has cut $7 million from
IT yearly expenditures. However,
Patterson said she is looking to cut
costs in other ways as well. She
stressed the importance of "ratio-
nalization" a University-wide
initiative to determine the best
source of information technol-

ogy service and at the same time,
identify ways of reducing "redun-
dancy."
"When you hear about IT ratio-
nalization, it's an initiative to look
at a whole list of services and deter-

In a statement released yester-
day, Scarnecchia said Masson was
truly the best candidate for the
position.
"As an experienced and success-
ful litigator, David brings broad
and deep knowledge of the Uni-
versity and legal community to the
role," Scarnecchia said in a state-
ment.
Throughout his time in the
Office of the General Counsel,
Masson has specialized in labor
and employment matters. Prior
to joining the University's legal
team, Masson worked as the chief
assistant corporation counsel for
the Labor/Worker Compensation
Division of the City of Detroit Law
Department.
Masson is a University alum.
He received his Bachelor of Arts
degree in political science with

as a trial site.
"What Google wants to see is
community involvement," Ray-
craft said.
Another community organi-
zation - Ann Arbor SPARK - is
alsobacking the city's efforts,
according to Elizabeth Parkin-
son, SPARK's vice president of
marketing and communications.
SPARK aims to foster eco-
nomic development county-
wide through things such as
sponsoring educational forums
for entrepreneurs. According
to Parkinson, Google Fiber's

Reid said the members of the
HLC were "flabbergasted" by
the optimism they saw in spite of
Michigan's economic woes.
Jon Cameron, an equipment
coordinator for LSA instructional
support services, also attended
the staff forum and said everyone
in attendance gushed about how
great it is to work at the University.
Prof.Shak Ketefian, who teach-
es in the School of Nursing and was
at the faculty meeting, said much
of the conversation in the faculty
forum was centered around bud-
getary concerns and international-
ization programs.
Many of the faculty members
in the meeting complimented the
way the University involved faculty
members in budgetary decisions,
according to Ketefian, but many
said they were concerned about
the uncertainty of the future of the
University's budget.
Ketefian also said some of the
faculty felt there was a need for
greater budgetary commitment to
international programs. There was
discussion, she said, of a new pro-
gram in which University Presi-
dent Mary Sue Coleman's office

mine what is the best source of the
service for the University at the
best price point." Patterson said.
One way this initiative could be
put into action is through consoli-
dating e-mail services on campus
into one system run by one unit,
like the University's Hospital, or to
outsource it to a third party vendor.
Currently the University's e-mail is
not managed by one system.
Patterson also said the Univer-
sity spends about $300 million
a year on information technol-
ogy services and she believes
it wastes money on "redundant
activities."
Patterson said the Univer-
sity could reinvest money it saves
through information technology
cost cutting measures into a "more
robust infrastructure" and useful
tools like video conferencing and
more advanced forms of commu-
nication.
Patterson said the current
infrastructure of the University's
information technology opera-
tions would be an issue when the
North Campus Research Complex
opens because it could make it dif-
ficult for those who work there to
collaborate.
Because units like the Univer-
sity's Hospital and Medical School
operate differently than other
units in terms of information tech-
nology, partnerships may be more

difficult.
Patterson said that in order to
improve all areas of information
technology, a consultant has been
hired to provide "third party eyes."

Marchack will fill the other
associate vice president and dep-
uty general counsel position when
she arrives on campus on April
5. Her position will involve help-
ing Scarnecchia to oversee legal
affairs at the University of Michi-
gan Health System.
The position was left vacant
after Edward Goldmanleft the post
at the end of 2008 to become a pro-
fessor in the University's School
of Medicine. From that point until
her departure at the beginning of
the month, Hage served as interim
associate vice president and depu-
ty general counsel for the UMHS.
In a press release issued yes-
terday, Scarnecchia praised
Marchack's depth of experience.
"Margaret's extensive experi-
ence in health care law at local,
regional and national levels will
add valuable expertise and per-

information technology compa-
nies - like Internet or software
developers - within the commu-
nity.
"We have a nice base of com-
panies that could benefit and
grow and expand through this,"
Parkinson said in an interview.
Parkinson added that SPARK
believes Ann Arbor will emerge
as a strong contender for the trial
location.
"People have such a sense of
pride about being an innovative
community and being recog-
nized as such," Parkinson said.
The city's application for the
broadband network is due by
March 26.
Every time the University gets
reaccredited, University officials
choose a specific topic for in-depth
attention in pursuit of improve-
ment. This time around, the Univer-
sity is focusing its special emphasis
study on internationalization.
In an interview with the Daily in
January, University Provost Teresa
Sullivan said University officials
chose internalization because they
are considering reevaluating Uni-
versity study abroad programs.
"We're thinking about different
models," Sullivan told the Daily at
the time. "I think the old model of
spending one semester of my junior
year in Florence isn't what people
want to do for study abroad any-
more."
"I think that they've got differ-
ent ideas in mind. Maybe it would
be three weeks in Beijing and three
weeks in Nairobi and comparing
and contrasting what you saw in
terms of water treatment systems
in those two places," she said in
January. "There's a lot more ways
to make it relevant to your program
and more than tourism."
An open meeting for students
was also held yesterday.

will make recommendations to
the University as a whole as well
as the deans of specific units about
the best ways to reduce costs.
According to Patterson, the deans
have the option to accept or deny
the recommendations, unless the
provost decides to intervene.
Patterson said she also plans
to create committees and groups
within the University to help
improve information technology
on campus.
"What we have tried to doit is to
look at decision-making for infor-
mation technology, not looking at
the University's traditional hierar-
chy, but by looking at domains of
shared interest or domains of the
mission of the University," Patter-
son said.
To consolidate these interests,
four domains will be created that
reflect four areas to research
improvements in information
technology at the University.
The four groups will be
research, libraries and digital
repositories, clinical care and
learning and teaching. An expert
in the area will head each division.
For example, Dean of Libraries
Paul Courant is expected to lead
the libraries and digital reposito-
ries domain.
Patterson said there will also be
a "technology council" comprised
of about twelve members. The

council will make recommenda-
tions to the executive officers on
the priority of information tech-
nology investments and help to
develop the vision for information
technology at the University.

Biden's visit to
Israel ignites
fire storm in
U.S. Congress

Lawmakers criticize
administration's
public condemnation
of settlements
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Obama administration's fierce
denunciationofIsraellast weekhas
ignited a firestorm in Congress and
among powerful pro-Israel inter-
est groups who say the criticism
of America's top Mideast ally was
misplaced.
Since the controversy erupted,
a bipartisan parade of influential
lawmakers and interestcgroups has
taken aim at the administration's
decisiontopublicly condemnIsrael
for its announcement of new Jew-
ish housingin east Jerusalem while
Vice President Joe Biden was vis-
iting on Tuesday and then openly
vent bitter frustration on Friday.
With diplomats from both coun-
tries referring to the situation as
a crisis, the outpouring of anger
in the United States, particularly
from Capitol Hill, comes at a dif-
ficult time for the administration,
which is now tryingto win support
from wary lawmakers - many of
whom are up for re-election this
year - for health care reform and
other domestic issues.
And those criticizing the admin-
istration's unusuallybluntresponse
to Israel say they fear it may have
distracted from and done damage
to efforts to relaunch long-stalled
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
"It might be well if our friends
in the administration and other
places in the United States could
start refocusing our efforts on the
peace process," Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., said Monday.
"Now we've had our spat. We've
had our family fight, and it's time
for us now to stop and get our eye
back on the goal, which is the com-
mencement of the Israeli-Palestin-
ian peace talks," he said.
McCain and Sen. Joe Lieber-
man, I-Conn., both urged the
administration to ease the tone of
the dispute, which they said was
demonstrating disunity and weak-
ness to steadfast allies of Iran.
"Let's cut the family fighting, the
family feud," Lieberman said. "It's
unnecessary; it's destructive of our
shared nationalinterest.It'satime to
lower voices, to get over the family
feud between the U.S. and Israel. It
just doesn't serve anybody's inter-
ests but our enemies."

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton upbraided Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for the housing announcement in
a tense and lengthy phone call on
Friday and White House officials
repeated the criticism on Sunday's
talk shows.
"It's hard to see how spending
a weekend condemning Israel for
a zoning decision in its capital city
amounts to a positive step towards
peace," said Sen. Sam Brownback,
R-Kan.' He complained that the
administration was attacking a
"staunch ally and friend" when it
should be focusing on the threat
posedbyIran's nuclearproblem.
Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev.,
accused administration officials of
using "overwrought rhetoric" in
suggesting that the east Jerusalem
housing announcement threatened
U.S.-Israeli ties.
"The administration's strong
implication that the enduring alli-
ance between the U.S. and Israel
has been weakened, and that
America's ability to broker talks
between Israel and Palestinian
authorities has been undermined,
is an irresponsible overreaction,"
shesaid.
With tensions still high, former
Sen. George Mitchell, the adminis-
tration's Mideast peace envoy, has
delayed his departure to the region,
where he is scheduled to hold sepa-
rate talks with Israeli and Palestin-
ianleaders, a U.S. official said.
Mitchell had been scheduled
to depart Washington on Monday
night. He still intends to go, but
the timing is uncertain, the official
said, speaking on condition of ano-
nymity in order to discuss internal
deliberations.
The State Department on Mon-
day said it was still awaiting a
formal response from Israel to
Clinton's call and, while repeating
elements of the criticism, stressed
that the U.S. commitment to Isra-
el's security remains "unshakable."
Butspokesman P.J. Crowley also
said a lot is riding on whetherIsrael
agrees to take steps suggested by
Clinton to underscore its com-
mitment to the peace process and
strong relations with America.

tions of this once we hear back
from the Israelis and see how they
respond to our concerns," he told
reporters.

According to Tim Slot-

fix soffits, or the underside of
the building's roof, on the build-
ing that have been damaged by
breaches of air and water con-
densation.
To correct the problem, Slot-
tow is requesting money to install
vapor and air barriers and to add
thermal insulation to the affected
areas. Additionally, the project
seeks to upgrade current mechan-
ical systems.
In his letter to the regents,
Slottow wrote that without the
necessary repairs, parts of the

Lending education a hand
U.S. Senate must save financial aid overhaul bill
When searching for loans for school, many students
look to private lenders. But a proposal before the U.S.
Senate could make the federal government students'
first option. The proposal would dramatically reorganize the
way the federal government finances student loans. It would sig-
nificantly expand a federal direct-lending program while ending
subsidies for private lenders. The bill has been tied to the health
care reconciliation bill after it appeared that it wouldn't have the
votes to make it through the Senate on its own. But regardless of
how the bill becomes law, Congress must secure the future of the
nation's students by passing this legislation.

The bill to overhaul student loans is
a version of the Student Aid and Fiscal
Responsibility Act, which was passed the
U.S. House of Representatives in Septem-
ber. It will end federal payments to private
lenders and replace these subsidies with a
government-run lending service called the
Federal Direct Student Loan Program. It
will also increase the individual Pell Grant
cap to $5,550 for the coming academic
year. Private student loan companies and
banks have protested the plan.
It's imperative that the government act
to make education more affordable and
accessible. As tuition is increased nation-
wide - it rose by 5.6 percent last year
alone here at the University - a college
education is becoming increasingly out
of range for those hit hard by the strug-
gling economy. But increased higher edu-
cation is essential to the sustainability of
a healthy economy. And though private
lending companies won't benefit from the
bill, the importance of students' access to
higher education should be paramount to
the interest of middlemen.
The federal government should do every-
thing possible to make sure students receive
as much money as possible. This bill would
increase the amount of money available to
students by cutting out the middleman. The

overhaul would send money straight to stu-
dents rather than having it stall in private
lending programs. And the bill would funnel
more money directlyto loans and Pell Grants
- money that an increasing number of stu-
dents need to counter rising tuition.
The bill has been packaged with the
health care reconciliation bill in response
to Senate Democrats' concerns that they
wouldn't be able to overcome a filibuster
on the health care package. And the finan-
cial aid bill to itself faced some challenges
from senators from states that are home
to lending companies, according to a Mar.
11 report by The New York Times. Demo-
crats hope that tying the bills together may
secure the votes needed to pass both.
But it's not so important how the bill gets
passed - just that it does. Senators who
object to the bill should recognize that the
importance of education is more important
than the well-being of private lenders. And
if the Senate can't make this legislation a
reality as part of the health care reconcili-
ation bill, it must take action to make it law
under its own name.
Senators should place the importance of
education above their individual interests.
Education is vital to economic recovery,
and senators should ensure that the finan-
cial aid bill becomes law.

As you might expect, I'm a man
who loves to have an opinion.
The discussions motivated
by this love have
enriched my life,
and shaped me into
who I am today.
But, there are cer-
tain beliefs that 1
have gotten me in
trouble over the.
years. Mostly, these
are things I know
are true, but that I CHRIS
have little hope to OLWH
ever prove. Some KOSLOWSKI
are trivial, and oth-_
ers are questions
humanity has pondered forever. So,
get ready to love or hate me, because
these are my five undeniable, probably
improvable, truths of life.
1. You wouldfloat in apool ofchoco-
late pudding.
It seems simple to me, yet I've been
battling my friends over this truth
since high school. They say you would
sink like a stone in a swimming pool
full of pudding. Like quicksand, the
pudding would suck you down to a
terrifying,, albeit delicious, death. I
say, pudding is heavier than water.
If you can float in water, you can cer-
tainly float in pudding. It's simple
buoyancy. If the volume of puddingI
displace weighs more than me, I float.
I did the math on this once, but I still
couldn't convince my brethren of the
obvious truth. Not only would a pud-
ding pool be scrumptious, it would
not be the deathtrap like so many
have thought.
2. God - or something - exists.
I don't think you even have to be
religious to believe this truth. Just
look at time and the universe. As
far as I know, they're both infinite.
I would dare even the most stalwart
atheist to look up at the stars on a
clear night and not be dazzled by the
mystery of how we came to be. Evolu-

tion explains a lot, but it doesn't tell
us where the original building blocks
came from. '
One little change in the infinite
history of time would've drastically
changed the present. If an infinite
string of events led to us being here,
as far as I'm concerned, our exis-
tence is impossible. Only one thing
can make the impossible possible,
and I don't really care if you call it
God, Yahweh, Vishnu, or the Flying
Spaghetti Monster. I have faith in my
concept of God, but I know that some-
thing is out there.
3. No matter how successfulyou are,
you will never be as cool as Samuel L.
Jackson.
I've got a confession to make. I
own a Rangol (that's a kind of hat -
Google it for a picture), and whenever
I wear it, I look into the mirror and
hope that I look a fraction as cool as
Samuel L. Jackson. I don't even come
close. In over 100 movies, Jackson
has been eaten by a shark, eaten by a
Velociraptor, almost eaten by snakes
and killed by Emperor Palpatine. Oh,
and he was Shaft. Shaft. What makes
Jackson cooler than Brad Pitt, Mor-
gan Freeman or Gerald Butler? I real-
ly don't know. I could be a billionaire.
I could be the president of the United
States. I could even be a famous actor.
But, I will never reach the level of
pure, unadulterated cool that Sam-
uel L. Jackson feels even when he's
brushing his teeth. And, guess what?
You won't either.
4. Disagreement means someone is
thinking.
This is especially true of our elect-
ed representatives. The most over-
rated idea constantly tossed around
in politics is compromise. Unless my
life, liberty or my ability to pursue
happiness is in jeopardy, I want my
representatives to fight for what their
constituents think is right. I love get-
ting negative responses to my col-
umns because it forces me to really

think about what I've written. Your
arguments are so encouraging to me
because they are evidence that what
I write inspires people to articulate
their own opinions. The United States
owes its existence to people who dis-
agreed with the British government.
Almost every major social and tech-
nological advancement started with
people who weren't satisfied with
the status quo. Disagreement can be
scary, but if handled responsibly, it
can benefit all parties involved.
Samuel L. Jackson
is cooler than you
will ever be. Ever.
5. Tryihg is the first step towards
failure.
I thank Homer Simpson for this
nugget of truth. So many problems
in the world could be eliminated
if people understood that failure,
though not usually acceptable, is
always an option. Humans are wired
to constantly push the envelope of
possibility. often, wefail, but the les-
sons we learn from our failures help
us succeed in the future. Problems
arise when people take risks without
preparing for consequences if they
don't succeed. You can apply this to
everything from mountain climb-
ing to adjustable rate mortgages to
love and relationships. We shouldn't
let the prospect of failure scare us
away from taking chances, but we
shouldn't expect to feel invincible
forever. Tryingneverguarantees suc-
cess. But not trying guarantees you
will never succeed.

MVP is M.I.A.


MVP is still committed to
accountabilityfor MSA
TO THE DAILY:
Last year, the Michigan Vision Party cam-
paigned on restoring transparency, account-
ability and a focus on students to the Michigan
Student Assembly. Our image took a hit this
week when we learned that MSA President
Abhishek Mahanti spent $9,000 developing a
new website that was never used (MSA website
$6,000 over budget, 03/10/2010). This reckless
lack of oversight is irresponsible and unac-
ceptable. We appreciate Mahanti for being
transparent and accountable and for taking
full responsibility for this egregious error, but
we are outraged by his actions. While Mahan-
ti ran with MVP last spring, he chose to disaf-
filiate himself from us at the beginning of his
term. We have not claimed credit for any of his
projects. 4
While we have taken strides to increase
the accountability and transparency of MSA,
this debacle sheds light on structural short-
comings that still exist. MVP is committed
to ensuring that mistakes like this never
happen again. This is one of the reasons we
wholeheartedly endorse the new constitu-
tion, which includes increased checks and
balances between MSA and its executives,
as well as an impeachment option. MVP has
always stood for transparency and account-
ability and we will never back down from
these values.
Don't be fooled by accusations that attempt
to discredit our entire party's work to date on
the basis of an isolated incident committed
by an unaffiliated person. MVP members are
responsible for spearheading numerous ini-
tiatives, from the Block M in the Big House
stands and the upcoming concert to Go Blue,
Beat OSU week and MSA Mondays on the Diag.

Hate crimes exist in spite of
evidence of social progress
TO THE DAILY:
On Saturday I was followed and attacked
because of my rainbow umbrella, and on Mon-
day I was a Crime Note (Drunk harasses pass-
erby with rainbow umbrella, 03/15/2010).
As I entered South Quad carrying a rain-
bow umbrella, a man who seemed to be drunk
screamed at me that I was a "faggot" and then
followed me inside the building, continuing
to yell obscenities and intimidating words. It
was frightening and painful, but with the sup-
port of friends, I began to move past it.
And then I read about it in the paper Mon-
day morning in the Crime Notes section, an
area where I usually find innocuous, unseri-
ous, or funny accounts. To anyone who found
the description of the incident funny: It wasn't
funny to me when I was fearing for my safety.
It wasn'tjust about having a rainbow umbrella
and someone being drunk. It was about hate
and prejudice. It was about the essence of
(part of) who I am. I'm not sure how well that
was conveyed in the crime note.
I deeply appreciate that the Daily runs
many articles, viewpoints and editorials about
queer issues. However, it seems that the nar-
rative we often hear is one of moving LGBT
people from a "neutral" state, where they
may not lack some rights but things are basi-
cally okay, to a better place. Examples of this
include articles advocating same-sex mar-
riage or partner benefits, like an editorial
that ran in the Daily last week (Love is a legal
battlefield, 03/10/2010). But the hate I experi-
enced on Saturday should be a reminder to us
all that, while moving forward to full equality
is important, we aren't even at a neutral place
yet. Acts of hatred and discrimination hap-
pen to LGBT people all the time. Prejudiced
and ignorant people are everywhere - even
in Ann Arbor. As we fight for more rights, we
must also fight hate and oppression in all its
ugly forms.

A year ago, as a leader of the College Democrats, I sat
on a committee that endorsed a slate of Michigan Student
Assembly candidates including those from the Michigan
Vision Party. The College Democrats endorsed MVP can-
didates on the promise they would make MSA account-
able, transparent and relevant to the needs of the student
body. Unfortunately, MVP's clouded vision of improving
campus through "small victories" has been overshad-
owed by massive failures of competency and responsibil-
ity in areas that directly affect the lives of students at the
University.
It's not an overstatement to say that, for the past year,
MVP has been MIA.
MVP promised to deliver a new, innovative MSA web-
site. Last week, it was announced repairs to the MSA
website came with a nearly $9,000 price tag. I expected a
high quality product that would provide a dynamic forum
for students and student organizations to interact with
MSA and each other. However, the $9,000 website was
never debuted and was replaced by a free website created
by an MSA representative. Additionally, MVP debuted a
website that was poorly designed, confusing and a step
backward in functionality.
The $9,000 price tag is a heinous abuse of the money
every student pays to MSA in fees. Hours upon hours
were billed for a project that was behind schedule and
of subpar quality. MSA representatives were kept in the
dark on project costs and were only presented with the
$9,000 bill after the project was completed. MVP made
this website a signature issue during its 2009 campaign,
but its initial vision seems to have been clouded by a
severe lack of oversight and leadership.
Michigan students put a lot of trust in MSA to spend
their money wisely and mismanagement of funds is a
violation of that trust. MVP's first order of business
after their successful election last year was to remodel
the MSA chambers in the Michigan Union. This costly
renovation diverted both money and attention away from
critical issues, like tuition increases, during the summer
months. For the past year, MVP has pursued shortsighted
priorities such as this, which don't address issues that
truly matter to students.
We, as students, must reconsider other major expendi-
tures approved by MSA - like the $25,000 to bring Wale
to campus for a concert this year. While I am excited for

this concert, students are still required to pay for tickets
to an event that is essentially subsidized by our tuition
fees. Where was the transparency that MVP promised us
when they made this $25,000 decision? This question is
especially vital at a time when President Mary Sue Cole-
man is bracingus for tuition hikes.
An issue MVP touts as a success is the increase in stu-
dent organization funding, but the process remains too
complicated and shuts out many qualified applicants.
This year, only 37 percent of applicants were approved for
funding, as noted in a Feb. 24 Daily report. This statis-
tic should be reversed. The entire campus is hurt when
funding is denied and events that would have otherwise
enriched campus are weakened or canceled altogether.
MVP should focus on increasing funding for all organi-
zations, not just those who traditionally receive funding.
I find the negligence of basic follow-through on the
part of MVP astounding. For instance, the fall MSA elec-
tions were rescheduled to the days immediately following
Thanksgiving Break because the proper emails were not
sent out in time to notify the student body, violating the
MSA Compiled Code.
I was surprised when I read in a recent viewpointin the
Daily that MVP wishes to "continue fighting for students'
rights" (A continued vision for MVP 03/08/2010). For a
year, I have neither seen nor heard MVP leaders advocat-
ing on behalf of the issues most important for students. I
watched MSA crumble last summer in the face of tuition
hikes, and I have seen no MVP leadership focused on
fighting Coleman's predicted tuition increase. I am pay-
ing more out of pocket because my student government is
willing to accept what Coleman calls "modest" increases
in tuition (Coleman: 'U' tuition levels likely to rise next
year, 03/08/2010). The student body can no longer accept
even "modest" increases and neither should MSA.
I was hopeful last year that new MSA leadership would
reconnect the assembly with students and make it rele-
vant again on campus. MVP leadership has failed at every
level to follow through on those promises, from debut-
ing a new website to speaking out on student issues. It's
time for new leadership that is willingto take a stand and
truly put in the work needed to represent students at the
University.

By ALEX HERMANN
Daily Sports Writer
Going into Monday as ESPN's
Charlie Creme's "last team in"
for the NCAA Tournament, the
Michigan women's basktball
team knew "Selection Monday"
was certain to be filled with anxi-
ety.
But as the field of 64 was
unveiled and Michigan was
absent from matchup after math-
cup, all the Wolverines' hopes of
an NCAA Tournament bid with-
ered away.
Still, Michigan remained posi-
tive in light of the news.
"To have a chance is something
that we're just thrilled with, and
it shows just how far we've come,"
freshman guard Jenny Ryan said.
"As it gets going and they show
the end of the at-large bids, the 10,
11, even 12 seeds. ... And then we
saw some teams that we weren't
expecting to get at-large bids that
went up there. So, you know, as it
goes on you kind of get this sink-
ing feeling that, okay, maybe this
isn't our year."
The Big Ten received four total
bids to the NCAA Tournament,
including Iowa, the conference's
other primary bubble team, as
a surprise nine seed. Michigan
swept the season series against
the Hawkeyes, which made the
Wolverines' fate come as some-
what of a surprise.
"When (Iowa) came up as a
pretty high seed, I thought that
was good for us," Michigan coach
Kevin Borseth said. "But obvi-
ously not."
At Big Ten Media Day earlier
this year in Chicago, Borseth said
receiving an NCAA Tournament
bid was the universal goal for
teams across the country, includ-
ing his own.
Yesterday, Borseth was unsure
of why his team was left out of the
Big Dance.
"They've got a pretty tough
task, sitting down in the room and
determining all that," Borseth
said. "They've got reasons why
they do what they do, and we just
have to live with it."
But despite the fact that
Michigan (8-10 Big Ten, 17-13
overall) leaves its preseason
aspirations unfulfilled, the
Wolverines expressed opti-
mism about their postseason.

TOREHAN SHARMAN/Daily
Michigan coach Kevin Borseth led the Wolverines to a 17-13 record this season
after being predicted to finish last in the Big Ten Media Preseason Poll.

t the tail end of last season, Wolverines' road to Joe Louis
Louie Caporusso, then a Arena for next weekend's CCHA

gan hockey team, drew some (Ohio), I've come to a realization

absent - Michigan is 6-1 in its last
seven games.
He's passing less and shoot-
ing more, something Michigan
coach Red Berenson has advised
the 5-foot-9 center time and time
again. His "keep it simple" men-
tality on the ice has paid positive
dividends for the Maize and Blue,
who are set to face the top-seeded
Redhawks on Friday.
If Michigan's ready to take
the next step and win the CCHA
Tournament, it will be led by
Caporusso.
And when he does, I won't be
sorry I told you so.
Burns suggests giving blood in the
near future. He gave blood yesterday
. in the Michigan Union. He can be
reached at burnmarkoumich.edu.

While it was not yet official when
the Daily spoke with the team,
a Women's National Invitation
Tournament bid seemed very
likely. Michigan will play Kent
State in the first round of the
WNIT on Friday in Crisler Arena.
"Ultimately, you kind of have to
prove it," junior guard Veronica
Hicks said. "It'll be all talk if we
don't come up big in the NIT. I
think it would show, youknow, that
you deserve to be in the NCAA if
you ultimately finish up the NIT."
Certainly, a just-missed NCAA
Tournament bid represents a
giant step forward for a program
that finished 10-20 a year ago and
was picked to finish last in the
conference in the preseason this

year.
"It's exciting for us, it's excit-
ing for the program, exciting for
fans and the entire university just
to really show that we are making
progress and that they have the
opportunity to see' that progress
in action," Ryan said. "We didn't
just make the (WNIT), we made
it as a high seed to get the home
game and that's exciting for us."
Regardless of the disappoint-
ment that may exist, the opportu-
nity to obtain a physical symbol of
that progress is certainly one the
team relishes.
"Our ultimate goal is to be
number one and win a champion-
ship," Hicks said. "Whether it's
NCAA or NIT, we'll get a banner."

Caporusso hadn't been play-

for me to come out and blatantly
call him a "ghost" on the ice was
clearly wrong - it just took him

Thumbing through media

Tuesday, March 16, 2010 - 7
Celebrity family trees get
needlessly explored on NBC

here is a flipbook on the
pages of queer filmmaker
Barbara Hammer's mem-
oir, "Hammer!" The images are
all shot in black
and white and
the bodies in
the pictures
move ever so ,
slightly with
the turn of the
page - the
minute shifting
of hands, heav- WHITNEY
ily shadowed, POW
over thighs
and breasts.
The movement is almost imper-
ceptible when crawling through
the book, page by page. When the
page edges quickly flip past one
another beneath the release of a
fingernail, however, the image
comes to life - the book becomes
a five-second film filled with sen-
sual, continuous movement.
This mixing and mingling of the
ideas of the viewing experience
in film with the sensual, visceral
experience of books peeks into the
idea of inter-medial art - looking
at the ways in which film trans-
gresses the film cell and leaks into
literature.
Hammer is an experimental
queer feminist filmmaker who
began producing ground-breaking
films in the 1970s, and her works
have been presented in the Muse-
um of Modern Art, the Whitney
Museum of American Art Biennial
and the Berlin International Film
Festival. Her book "Hammer!"
was released only a few weeks
ago on March 1, and she arrived
last Thursday in Ann Arbor's C.C.

up and down the aisle with grand

and loud.

New historical
reality series offers
no insight, just facts

NBC's new
version of the
British geneal-
ogy show, has Who Do

request for the
celebrities it You Are?
features. No, it's
not challenging Fridays at
them to a fight, 8 p.m.
as the mislead- NBC
ingly confron-
tational title might have viewers
believe. Rather, the documentary-
style reality show asks its celebrity
participants to take journeys back
through time, exploring their fam-
ily histories. While more sincerely
heartfelt than most trips into the
personal lives of celebrities, "Who
Do You Think You Are?" doesn't
offer enough historical depth to
consistently entertain.
The pilot episode depicts Sarah
Jessica Parker ("Sex and the City")
searching for traces of deceased
relatives across the country. She
discovers that her ancestors were
involved in the California gold
rush of 1849, as well as the 17th-
century Salem witch trials. On
one hand, SJP's interest in these
chapters of American history and
her familial ties to them is surpris-
ingly genuine. She even remarks
that her discoveries have made
her feel more defined as a person.
On the other hand, why does SJP,
an already famous and successful
person, need NBC's help to find
herself?
It would have been more worth-
while for "Who Do You Think You
Are?" to feature regular people and
investigate their roots. In doing

"I could've sworn i descended from strong, independent New York alcoholics.

so, the show could emphasize
how seemingly ordinary men and
women have descended from peo-
ple with amazing stories - stories
that were an important part of his-
tory. Doing this for celebrities only
makes them seem more narcissistic
rather than historically curious.
And even when the celebs
appear enthusiastic, like Emmitt
Smith in the series's second epi-
sode, the show doesn't give the
viewer enough context to share
in the excitement. The historical
events surrounding the lives of the
ancestors - even the ancestors'
lives themselves - aren't dealt with
in a meaningful, substantive way.
Viewers don't learn anything new
about the 1849 gold rush or Salem
witch trials from the pilot, other
than that SJP is related to someone
who was there.

The show also suffers from not
having a host. While certain feel-
good reality shows like "The Big-
gest Loser" and "Extreme Home
Makeover" are enhanced by reli-
able, enthusiastic hosts, "Who Do
You Think You Are?" has no one to
anchor it, as the featured celebrity
is different each week. Throw in
the constant, sappy music and it's
easy to feel suffocated by the lack
of a familiar face.
Despite its shortcomings, "Who
Do You Think You Are" would
have something to offer if its par-
ticipants' ancestries received more
than cursory glances. But until it
can teach viewers somethingthey
haven't already learned in third-
grade history classes, this gene-
alogy documentary will remain
only slightly more essential than
any other celebreality show.

. Cops with scrunchies on 'Police
Women of Maricopa County'

Several nights at
the museum

By LINDSAY HURD
DailyArts Writer
"You do one thing wrong and I'm com-
ing after you" - this may sound like your
mom, but it's in fact the tagline for the
police women who patrol
the streets in Maricopa to
"protect" its citizens.
TLC's twist on "Cops" Police
follows detectives Deb
Moyer and Lindsey Smith Women of
along with deputies Kelly Mancopa
Bocardo and Amie Duong
as they cruise around Ari- CoU Ny
zona's Maricopa County Thursdays
fighting crime. Each cop is a 9P.M.
followed individually as she TL
hunts down drug criminals, TLC
cars withoverly tinted win-
dows and old women who avoid pulling over
when being stopped for speeding.
Unfortunately, none of the offenses to
which the women respond really seem like
that big of a deal. It's young kids dealing
drugs and illegal immigrants crossing the
border and small domestic disputes that
are so anti-climatic it seems like they must
have been faked for lack of more interesting
crimes going on in Maricopa.
Besides combating the evils of drugs

and illegal immigration, "Police Women"
focuses on the motherly duties of all its
main ladies. After their long and hard days
at work, the mothers go home to their kids
and families. Without exception, every time
an officer finishes a call, she emphasizes
that she must get home to her kids at night.
While they should be applauded for balanc-
ing both duties, it's not necessary to explain
it in depth after every crime is solved.
What's even more annoying is that the
ladies feel the need to define their feminin-
ity with their giant hair, ugly scrunchies
and consistent reminders of their children
at home. Every one of them talks like a
broken record about their kids and family
- just in case you missed it the first seven
times. Everyone gets that you love your
kids - and that's great - but the insistence
on the home/work dynamic tries to create
a remarkable story where there is none. In
case TLC was unaware, it's common for
women to work and have a family, so the
idea of a mom being a cop isn't exactly an
original concept.
Needless to say, all these women could
kick the shit out of anyone, and you
wouldn't want to run into them if you are
in trouble with the law. From start to fin-
ish, each cop is so intense it's like they
were chasing down America's Most Want-

ed, but really it's just another kid running
a stop sign.
The only entertaining part of the hour-
long bore is when one of the ladies checks
on an old woman who hasn't been in contact
with her family for the last few days. What
they find is a feisty and nutty old woman
who laughs at the camera and continues to
tell the crew about how she just went and
Busting heads and

had her hair done. Other than that, the
criminals are all scummy old men who rock
their mullets with pride.
The worst part is that Maricopa County,
in many ways an innocent bystander here, is
clearly not getting positive press from this
wonder of a program. "Police Women" por-
trays the city like it's full of boring crime
and cops who don't really do anything pro-
ductive to help the city, but rather care more
about their TV personaof "busting some ass"
while being soccer moms.

When most people walk into a muse-

its. In accordance
with the current lecture series
theme semes- Thursdays at
ter, "Meaningful 230 p tm
Objects: Museums 2.30 p.m.
in the Academy," Kelsey Museum
the "A Day at the
Museum" lecture series, presented by
the school of Literature, Science and
the Arts, is intended to associate the
bland titles and broad institutions of
the museum world with individual
faces and colorful personalities who
work behind the scenes of University
museums.
The lecture series will include
speakers from nearly all the museums
on campus, ranging from Sindecuse
MuseumofDentistrytotheBentleyHis-
torical Library to the University Her-
barium. It was launched this January
due to the efforts ofsKaren O'Brien, Col-
lections Manager at the Kelsey Museum
of Archaeology, and Carla Sinopoli, pro-
fessor of Anthropology and director of
the Museum of Anthropology.
O'Brien and Sinopoli originally want-
ed to organize their idea into a class
with readings on the different positions
found in museums. However, O'Brien
said that after its rejection by the Uni-
versity, they transformed the class into
a lecture series.
"A Day at the Museum" will feature
speakers from a variety of professions in
museum work, including conservators,
collection staff and curators.
O'Brien described the series as infor-
mal. The museum staff speakers will
speak for only 10 or 15 minutes before
the floor is opened up for questions,
maximizing the amount of the presen-
tation that can be devoted to where stu-
dent interest really lies.
Last Thursday, exhibit preparators
John Klausmeyer of the Exhibit Muse-
um of Natural History and Scott Meier
of the Kelsey Museum of Archaeol-
ogy discussed their backgrounds and
careers.
Both Klausmeyer and Meier empha-
sized the diversity of studies that led
them to their career in museums.
"Onething I do want to discuss is that

there is no set career path," Meier said.
"Get experience everywhere because
you never quite know where it will lead
you."
With abackground in art, Klausmey-
er has worked in medical illustration
and moved on to exhibit preparation at
natural history museums.
In additiontotheir personal accounts,
both exhibitpreparatorsdiscussed their
everyday work.
"Our jobs are sort of the interface
between curators and researchers and
the public,"Klausmeyer said.
As a whole, "A Day at the Museum"
lecture series aims to give students a
realistic view of museum work.
O'Brien said that a major focus will
be "the impact museums have on com-
munities, and understanding more
about the concepts of museums,"
O'Brien also hopes that the series will
give any studentswith aspirations in the
museum career field a realistic look at
what the work will actually be like.
Like Klausmeyer and Meier, O'Brien
A look into the
museum life.
emphasizes the various disciplines that
can be applied to a profession in muse-
ums.
She said there was a considerable
"cross platform of degrees that students
might be getting here at the University
that can translate then into museum
work," O'Brien said.
This interdisciplinary nature of
the museum field has been conveyed
through the diversity of lectures in the
series. Previous lecturers have includ-
ed Natsu Oyobe, curator of UMMA,
and Amy Harris, museum director of
the Exhibit Museum of Natural His-
tory.
Klausmeyer's and Meier's lecture
aims to exemplify the type of museum
work that can be overlooked and will
give attendees a different perspective of
the complex world of museums.
This Thursday, the series will fea-
ture speakers involved in conserva-
tion, including Ann Flowers of the
Bentley Historical Library, Cathy
Baker of Hatcher Graduate Library and
Suzanne Davis of the Kelsey Museum
of Archaeology.

ARTS IN BRIEF
FILM REVIEW
Fine film,
terrible ending
Remember Me
At Quality 16 and Showcase
Summit
Coen Brothers fatalism, meet
5 the new James Dean. "Remem-
ber Me" is a poetic tragedy that
revolves around NYU student
Tyler Hawkins (Robert Pat-
tinson, "Twilight"), his new-
found love Ally Craig (Emilie de
Ravin, "Lost") and the tangled
web of broken relationships that
binds them to their turbulent
pasts.
There's not much to say that
hasn't been hashed out in depth
all over the mediascape: The end-
ing is offensive and has no perti-

nence to the story - it ruins an
excellent movie by attempting to
capitalizeoffaverysensitive time
in our national history. Further-
more, it almost entirely negates
the familial bonds that are devel-
oped as the story progresses and
adds yet another death to a lam-
entable body count.
However, Pattinson doesn't
squander his ample screen time.
Sulking has never looked so
stylish, and prototypical male
chauvinism is forgone in lieu of
a chivalrous masculinity that
endears his character to the
utmost. Pattinson's photogenic
face would alone be sufficient to
carry his career, but many crit-
ics fail to give him the benefit of
the doubt as an inexperienced
actor. The roles he's choosing
for future work are increasingly
sophisticated and will undoubt-
edly effect the positive evolu-
tion of his acting abilities.

By HEATHER POOLE

Inspiration can strike from

plinary artist
Marian Bantjes Marian
explores this *
curious aspect
of inspira- Thursday at
tion and how it 5:10 p.m.
can be derived Michigan Theater
from seemingly
unlikely places
that span across a vast number of
interests.
As part of the Penny W. Stamps
Distinguished Speakers Series,
Bantjes will be speaking this
Thursday about her past work
and experiences that led to her
status as an internationally rec-
ognized visual artist.
In her lecture, Bantjes attempts
to clarify the idea of inspiration,
emphasizing "the difference
between inspiration, influence
and reference material (and) ...
the importance of creative work
in society."
Bantjes credits much of the
inspiration behind her work as
a derived from various, seem-
ingly disparate sources. The main
focus and title of her lecture is a
concept she calls the "cross-polli-
nation of inspiration."

"It's how I get my ideas from
other disciplines," she added.
"It's about how creativity is this ...
universal thing that gets seeds of
inspiration from all sorts of disci-
plines."
As part of her explanation
of cross-pollination, Bantjes
emphasized the influence of other
subjects in her own work and
consequently how her work may
influence other professionals in
different fields of study.
"I get ideas all the time from all
sorts of different sources, so it's
very magical in the way that hap-
pens," Bantjes said. "The things
that inspire me are not always
visual.
"I'm inspired by the things that
I read, films that I see, music that
I hear and books that I read, so
in the same way ... my work may
inspire a scientist or a playwright
or a philosopher and that, in turn,
might be a seed that ... makes
something that inspires some-
body else in another discipline,"
she added.
Known for her highly ornate
vector art and eye-catching
graphic design, Bantjes's work
has been featured in magazines,
book covers, posters and adver-
tisements. Some of her most
famous work includes her designs
for GQ and New York Times
Magazine. She has also worked
for Saks Fifth Avenue in their ad
campaigns.
Currently, Bantjes is writing
a book called "I Wonder" to be
released this fall. She will briefly

discuss her book at the lecture.
"('I Wonder') is about looking
at the world in a way of wonder, of
looking at the world visually and
getting a sort of joyous visual per-
spective on the things that we see
around us," Bantjes said.
In addition to her focus on
both her personal inspiration and
her theory of cross-pollination,
Bantjes hopes to impart a sense of
confidence to students interested
in pursuing a career in art.
"I hope (the students) will walk

away with the idea that doing
really good imaginative work
actually matters in the world,
that aesthetics aren't something
superfluous, that they're impor-
tant," she said.
"In a lot of the world, there is
... this idea that aesthetic work is
frivolous and I don't think it is at
all," she added. "So I want (the
students) to understand that and
feel emboldened and confident
that they can work visually, and
that it does makea difference."
