GOVERNMENT

Federal resouce 
to provide data on 
costs, financial aid 

by school

By SAMI WINTNER

Daily Staff Reporter

With college application sea-

son in full swing, the White 
House launched a new initiative 
Saturday to provide a compre-
hensive college data source for 
prospective undergraduates.

The 
College 
Scorecard 
— 

which includes data by college 
on cost of attendance, graduation 
rates and student loan debt — is 
intended to help families deter-
mine which schools may be the 
best fit. The scorecard also con-
textualizes each school’s set of 
data by providing comparisons to 
national averages.

The site also links to resources 

that provide students with infor-
mation on federal financial aid 
packages, as well as a tool that 
forecasts the federal aid students 

would likely receive.

Along with the rollout, the 

U.S. Department of Education 
highlighted the University’s for 
its high graduation rate and low 
costs for low-income students. 
The University was one of 30 
schools to make the list, which 
included several Ivy League 
schools like Harvard Univer-
sity and Yale University. Only six 
public universities made the list, 
including two of the University’s 
peer institutions, the University 
of Virginia and the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

Obama has recently intro-

duced several policy initiatives 
focused on higher education, 
including a plan to move the Free 
Application for Federal Student 
Aid deadline forward to align 
the delivery of aid packages with 
college decisions, as well as a 
$175-million grant competition 
to promote apprenticeships.

Along with First Lady Michelle 

Obama, Dr. Jill Biden and Secre-
tary of Education Arne Duncan, 
Obama is leading a nationwide tour 
focused on education. The presi-

Mechanism 

developed at ‘U’ 

could also improve 

early detection

By IRENE PARK

Daily Staff Reporter

University researchers pub-

lished a study last week that 

could lead to a lower mortality 
rate for breast cancer patients. 

Lonnie Shea, professor of bio-

medical engineering and chemi-
cal engineering, and Jacqueline 
Jeruss, associate professor of 
surgery, developed a device to 
attract and capture cancer cells. 
The aim: improve early detec-
tion of breast cancer that spread 
to other organs — such as lungs, 
liver, brain and bones — and form 
tumors, which is called metasta-

sic breast cancer. This can subse-
quently cause organ failure.

The study, published in Nature 

Communications, reports the 
device can not only aid early 
diagnosis, but also prevent breast 
cancer’s further spread.

Shea said metastasis is often 

discovered when the tumor has 
already spread to other organs and 
the organs’ functions are impaired.

“Unfortunately, the available 

therapies are not very effective 

at that point,” Shea said.

According to the National 

Cancer Institute, breast cancer is 
the second most common cancer 
for women in the United States, 
and the second leading cause of 
cancer-related deaths in women. 
There are about 230,000 new 
cases in women and 2,300 cases 
in men each year.

The 
porous, 
sponge-like 

device described in the study is

RESEARCH

Study finds daily use 
climbed nationally, 
though prevalence in 
A2 remains unclear

By KATIE PENROD

Daily Staff Reporter

Students in the United States 

are using marijuana at the high-
est rate since 1980, according 
to recent results from a survey 
conducted by the University’s 
Institute for Social Research. 
Though the numbers attracted 
significant attention nationally, 
it’s unclear whether the findings 
mirror trends at the University.

The study, funded by the 

National 
Institute 
on 
Drug 

Research and conducted annu-
ally for the past 35 years, found 
that one in 17 college students 
smokes marijuana on a daily or 
near-daily basis.

The number of students who 

said they had used marijuana 
within the past 30 days also 
increased in recent years, from 

17 percent in 2006 to 21 percent 
in 2014. Additionally, the per-
centage of students who said 
they had smoked in the past 
year increased from 30 percent 
in 2006 to 34 percent in 2014.

Lloyd Johnston, a research 

professor and senior research 
assistant at the Institute for 
Social Research, said the sur-
vey doesn’t provide a defini-
tive answer as to whether these 
trends apply at the University. 
Because the survey pulled from 
students nationwide, there is no 
data specific to Ann Arbor.

However, he said because the 

University is academically rig-
orous and selective, marijuana 
use might not be as prevalent 
compared to other schools.

On the other hand, John-

ston said the perception of 
marijuana’s risks has decreased 
in recent years, leading to 
increased use in many parts of 
the United States. The survey 
found the percentage of high 
school graduates, ages 19 to 22, 
who thought marijuana was 
dangerous decreased from 55 

Pollack: Proposal 
could decrease 

alcohol consumption 

on Thursdays

By SHOHAM GEVA

Daily News Editor

University Provost Martha 

Pollack said Tuesday she was 
supportive of a faculty recom-

mendation that more classes 
be held on Friday to address 
excess student drinking.

The Senate Advisory Com-

mittee on University Affairs 
suggested the proposal Mon-
day during their weekly meet-
ing, which Pollack attended.

“I am very concerned — I 

think as is (University Presi-
dent Mark Schlissel), and Vice 
President (for Student Life E. 
Royster) Harper — about the 
issue of drinking on campus,” 

Pollack said in an interview 
with The Michigan Daily. “And 
we do know that one of the 
issues is that now the weekend 
often spans three days and that 
there is a problem with Thurs-
day evening drinking and there 
is research that shows that Fri-
day classes cut down on Thurs-
day-evening 
drinking. 
So, 

because I actually care quite 
deeply about the safety and 
well-being of our students, I

outline several initiatives for the 
upcoming year. Dean of Students 
Laura Blake Jones also addressed 
the assembly to promote a close 
working 
relationship

CSG and her office.

CSG President Cooper Charl-

ton, an LSA senior, also lauded the 
assembly’s joint initiative with 
University Dining to open din-
ing halls on last Saturday’s game 
day up to three hours earlier than 
normal weekend hours. The effort 
aimed to curb unsafe drinking by 
providing students, particularly 
freshmen, access to food before 
tailgating activities.

U. Texas fires athletic director

The University of Texas, 

Austin fired its athletic 
director, Steve Patterson, 
The Daily Texan reported 
Tuesday.

Patterson’s firing comes 

after UT’s athletic depart-
ment 2013-2014 fiscal year 
report marked a net loss 
of $8.1 million — a loss in 
funding 
that 
Patterson 

apparently tried to com-
pensate for by raising foot-
ball and basketball season 
ticket prices.

Patterson will likely be 

replaced by Mike Perrin, 
a Houston-based attorney 
who once played football 
for UT-Austin and is an 
inductee to the Texas Ath-

letics Men’s Hall of Honor.

Cornell makes chang-

es to its sexual assault 

policy

Cornell University will 

now 
include 
additional 

protections 
for 
sexual 

assault survivors, the Cor-
nell Daily Sun reported 
Friday. These additions 
were made to align with 
a forthcoming New York 
State law, which, among 
other statutes, requires 
universities 
to 
use 
an 

“affirmative 
consent” 

standard when investigat-
ing possible instances of 
assault.

Affirmative consent is 

defined as “a knowing, 
voluntary 
and 
mutual 

decision among all partici-
pants to engage in sexual 
activity.”

“Our efforts to address 

sexual assault and vio-
lence on our campus will 
continue to evolve as we 
partner — faculty, stu-
dents and staff — to create 
a safe and inclusive place 
to study, live and work,” 
said 
Mary 
Opperman, 

Cornell’s vice president 
for human resources and 
safety services.

Law School student Kya Henley selects produce at the M Farmer’s Market outside the Michigan Union on Monday. The market sells locally 
grown fruits, vegetables and flowers every Monday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. through the end of October

Weekly market 

returned Monday, 
included new food 

demonstration

BY ISOBEL FUTTER

Daily Staff Reporter

Packing the fridge with fresh fruits 

and veggies just got easier. By popular 
demand, M Farmers Market is setting 
up shop weekly this semester to pro-
vide fresh options to students.

The first market was held by the 

fountain outside the Michigan Union 
on Monday morning. The event fea-
tured fresh produce from Zilke 
Farm, located in Milan, Mich. Each 
week, the farm provides a selection 
of produce, and students are able to 
purchase fruits and vegetables at a 
reasonable cost.

The event also featured a food dem-

onstration led by Frank Turchan, 
executive chef for Michigan Dining, 
to exemplify how students can cre-
ate healthy meals despite their busy 
schedules.

LSA senior Sushmitha Diraviam, 

chair of the Health Initiatives Com-
mittee for Central Student Govern-
ment, has been working closely with 
the committee, as well as MDining, 
the University of Michigan Health 
System and University Unions to orga-
nize the event.

“It brings a lot of stuff to campus 

such as local produce, education, sus-
tainability and accessibility of fresh 
produce,” Diraviam said. “Finding 
fresh produce on campus is a little bit 
of a problem and I think this event 
helps to solve that issue.”

In past years, the M Farmers Mar-

ket has been held only three times 
during the fall semester. However, 
this year, the organizers decided to 
hold the market weekly.

“It’s 
specifically 
due 
to 
the 

demand,” Diravia said. “Having them 
every week will allow people to know 
that Mondays are the market days 
and it’ll get ingrained into people’s 
heads.”

LSA junior Harrison West walked 

by the market and stopped to look at 
the available produce Monday.

“I was walking to go make lunch, 

when I saw this,” West said. “Fresh 

food is good, so I thought I’d check it 
out.”

LSA junior Kelly Rea said she was 

pleased with her experience at the 
market.

“It offers a different way to get food 

outside of dining hall and fast food 
options,” Rea said.

Engineering 
freshman 
Maggie 

Braunreuther stopped by the event 
and bought some peaches and plums.

“It’s close to my dorm, so I thought 

it was great,” Braureuther said. “It 
gives an opportunity for students to 
give back to the community and sup-
port sustainable foods.”

Alongside the available produce, 

the market also handed out free bags 
and T-shirts to students and other 
shoppers who stopped by the event.

Keith Soster, director of Student 

Engagement for Michigan Dining, 
said he believes the markets have been 
a huge success.

“Students enjoy them, faculty enjoy 

them and the Zilke’s always bring a 
variety of goods,” Soster said.

The markets will likely run through 

the end of October.

State lawmakers 
tout “Yes Means 
Yes” campaign

State Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr. 

(D–Meridian Twp.) and State 
Rep. Tom Cochran (D–Mason) 
proposed legislation to require 
schools 
to 
strengthen 
their 

definition of consent in their 
sexual education courses, the 
Detroit Free Press reported. The 
legislation would clarify that sex 
without a verbal “yes” could be 
assault. 

The bill would also clarify 

that individuals can take back 
their consent at any point and 
that just because two individuals 
are in a relationship does not 
mean unwanted sex is not sexual 
assault. 

‘U’ business school 
wins national honor 
for diversity work

The Ross School of Business 

received 
the 
2015 
Higher 

Education 
Excellence 
in 

Diversity award for the school’s 
efforts to integrate diversity 
and inclusion throughout its 
programs.

The award from INSIGHT Into 

Diversity magazine is a national 
honor and the will be featured 
in the November 2015 issue of the 
magazine, along with the 91 other 
winners of the award. 

The magazine commended 

the Business School for its 
efforts in inclusive excellence 
displayed on the school’s 
website. In addition, the school 
has many student-led groups 
and conferences that promote 
diversity. The Business School 
also recently launched a new 
Identity and Diversity and 
Organizations requirement 
for undergraduates this fall, 
providing students with the 
opportunity to gain experience 
working on diverse teams, as 
well as encouraging a positive 
organizational culture. 
School of Music, 
Theatre & Dance 
reopens Moore 
Building 

After a three-year, $29.5 mil-

lion renovation, the School of 
Music, Theatre & Dance’s Earl V. 
Moore Building on North Cam-
pus reopened its doors for stu-
dents to enjoy improved music 
study facilities, the University 
Record reported. 

Originally designed by famed 

architect Eero Saarinen in 1964, 
the building will now feature a 
new entrance and lobby, a large 
rehearsal hall, a music technol-
ogy center, a lecture hall, a suite 
of percussion practice rooms and 
new classrooms. 

dent’s first stop was at Macomb 
County Community College in 
Warren last Wednesday.

In 
Warren, 
Obama 
said 

employers 
are 
increasingly 

requiring some form of higher 
education for new hires, a sen-
timent he echoed in his week-
ly address Saturday. In both 
speeches, the President said 
higher education is the best ticket 
to the middle class.

“By the end of this decade, two 

in three job openings will require 
some higher education,” he said 
Saturday in his weekly address. 
“That’s one reason why a degree 
from a two-year college will earn 
you $10,000 more each year than 
someone who only finished high 
school. One study showed that a 
degree from a four-year universi-
ty earns you $1 million more over 
the course of a lifetime.”

In the weekly address, Obama 

argued that because it is becoming 
a necessity to earn a degree beyond 
a high school diploma to succeed 
in the workforce, it is important 
that prospective students have 
access to the kind of data the Col-
lege Scorecard provides.

“You’ll be able to see how 

much each school’s graduates 
earn, how much debt they gradu-
ate with, and what percentage of 
a school’s students can pay back 
their loans — which will help all 
of us see which schools do the 
best job of preparing America for 
success,” he said.

The White House said in a press 

release Saturday that this data is 
critical because college costs and 
student debt are growing.

“Students struggle to find 

clear, reliable data on critical 
questions of college affordability 
and value, such as whether they 
are likely to graduate, find mid-
dle-class jobs and pay off their 
loans,” the release said.

Susan Dynarski, professor of 

education, public policy and eco-
nomics at the University, said the 
University does a good job pro-
viding funding for its low-income 
students, especially in compari-
son to Ivy League schools.

College 
Scorecard 
reports 

the average annual cost for in-
state students at public univer-
sities who are federal financial 
aid recipients. It also provides a 
cost breakdown based on family 
income and a tool that allows stu-
dents to calculate their personal 
net cost of attendance. Accord-

ing to the scorecard, the average 
annual cost for in-state students 
at the University is $16,287, which 
falls just slightly under the report-
ed national average: $16,789.

The median earnings of Uni-

versity graduates who received 
federal financial aid, 10 years 
after their first year at the school, 
totals $57,900 — more than 
$20,000 higher than the report-
ed national average. Scorecard 
says 78 percent of students who 

attended the University are earn-
ing more than the median high 
school graduate.

The site reports 37 percent 

of students at the University 
receive federal financial aid and 
the median federal debt for stu-
dents who graduated from the 
University is $22,000. Scorecard 
notes that 93 percent of Univer-
sity graduates are in the pro-
cess of paying down their debt 
— almost 30 percent higher than 
the reported national average.

Dynarski said the scorecard is 

useful because it provides pro-
spective students with a more 
comprehensive picture of the 
institutions they may attend.

She also said when the Obama 

administration launched the Col-
lege Scorecard, it released the data 
it contains in raw form, which 
could enable other institution’s to 
find innovative ways to dissemi-
nate the information to students.

“This means that all of the 

nonprofit organizations out there 
that aim to help students navigate 
the college application process 
can take this data and generate 
their own scorecards, their own 
apps for smartphones,” she said. 
“So I think the point is for it to 
leverage the capacity of other 
organizations to help students.”

Dynarski 
cautioned, 
how-

ever, that the comparison the 
site makes between each school-
specific metric and the national 
average is not always the most 
useful tool to look at in determin-
ing the performance of a particu-
lar institution.

To assess whether or not Uni-

versity graduates are success-
ful, she said comparisons should 
be drawn only between the 
University and its peer institu-
tions, such as the University of 
California at Berkeley and the 
University of Virginia. Students 
at these schools, she said, come 
from similar backgrounds and 
have similar educational abilities 

to University students — which 
differ from those of the median 
college student.

“I don’t think it would be accu-

rate or helpful to focus on, ‘Look: 
University of Michigan graduates 
make more money than the typi-
cal college student,’ because the 
typical college student is going 
to a non-selective institution and 
they weren’t at the top of their 
high school classes,” she said. 
“Michigan can’t get credit for 
how smart (its students) are com-
ing into Michigan.”

According to the scorecard, the 

University of California at Berke-
ley has a graduation rate similar 
to the University’s, and its median 
graduate earns about $5,000 more 
a year than the University’s. The 
University of Virginia also has a 
similar graduation rate to both 
schools, and its median graduate 
earns very close to its counterpart 
at the University.

In an e-mail interview Tues-

day, Stephen DesJardins, profes-
sor of education and public policy 
at the University, said he likes the 
scorecard because it acknowl-
edges that prospective students 
are consumers of information, 
and provides them with the 
information they need, based on 
“official” government data.

He said it would be most useful 

to what he called “traditional stu-
dents:” those looking to attend a 
four-year institution straight out 
of high school. DesJardins said 
the scorecard would be of limited 
use for non-traditional students.

He noted that while the tool 

is helpful, it does not necessarily 
meet all of the Obama adminis-
tration’s goals regarding the pro-
vision of higher education data. 
He said the administration has 
stated its goal to hold higher edu-
cation institutions more account-
able, and added that this tool does 
little in that regard.

Dean of Students Laura Jones describes her position to new and returning Central Student Council members and urges 
them to use her as a resource during the CSG meeting at the Union on Tuesday.

small and can be implanted in 
the patient’s body. It acts as a 
“scaffold” by trapping metastat-
ic cancer cells from the patient’s 
bloodstream during the early 
stages of cancer.

Jeruss said the device could 

be extremely useful because it 
would serve as an early warn-
ing system for metastasis. Once 
the cancer is detected, early 
chemotherapy could prevent the 
spread of cancer to other organs.

“We may be able to preserve the 

integrity of the organs and ensure 
longer survival,” Jeruss said.

In addition to detecting meta-

static breast cancer, the device 
can prevent its spread. When 
tested in mice, 88 percent fewer 
cancer cells spread to the lungs 
of animals with the scaffold 
as compared to those without. 
Jeruss said this ability to offset 
cancer spread came as a surprise.

“The original intent of the 

work was to examine an inter-

vention that could be used for 
early detection,” Jeruss said. 
“But we then came to find 
that we were able to offset the 
advancement in metastasis with 
the device. That was a striking 
finding for us.”

Jeruss said the device will 

next need to be tested in human 
breast cancer patients through a 
clinical trial. She added that the 
device may be useful for former 
breast cancer patients who need 
to watch for a recurrence, or for 
high-risk healthy patients.

So far, the device has only 

been tested for breast cancer 
cells. Jeruss said researchers are 
examining the device’s potential 
usefulness in treating other can-
cers, including ovarian, prostate 
and pancreatic cancer.

Shea said the device is not 

only useful for diagnostic and 
therapeutic purposes, but also 
for uncovering how metasta-
sis occurs.

“This device is useful for try-

ing to understand the system,” 
Shea said. “We can design an 
implant and investigate the

“We were able to, in my opin-

ion, prevent some trips to the 
hospital because students had 
food in their stomachs,” Charl-
ton said.

Between the hours of 7:15 and 

10:30 a.m. on Saturday, 1,394 stu-
dents swiped into South Quad, 
compared to the 114 that arrived 
after the traditional opening 
time. Hill and Bursley dining 
centers also had an increase of 
student diners during game day’s 
early hours.

Though CSG made efforts to 

increase the frequency of buses 
to North Campus on Saturday, 
Charlton said a higher concen-
tration of buses will be required 
on future game days to meet the 
demand of large groups heading 
to central campus.

CSG 
also 
addressed 
the 

upcoming revision period for the 
University’s Statement of Stu-

dent Rights and Responsibilities.

Jacob Pearlman, CSG chief of 
student general council, request-
ed the assembly’s participation in 
the amendment processes. The 
document is amended once every 
three years, and he requested 
assembly members take advan-
tage of the opportunity and pro-
pose amendments.

Jones addressed the assembly 

about how a close relationship 
between CSG and the Dean of 
Students Office may improve the 
various services and programs 
they offer.

Jones spoke of initiatives new 

to campus since her appointment 
such as the Expect Respect cam-
paign, which aims to promote an 
inclusive campus environment, 
and the Beyond the Diag pro-
gram, which provides an exten-
sion of University resources for 
off-campus students.

“Seven years ago when I 

arrived on campus, we did not 
have anything in place to meet 

the needs of off-campus students 
in a formal sort of way,” Jones 
said. “I worked hand-in-hand 
with the Central Student Gov-
ernment at the time and students 
on the then-safety commission 
who conceived of what Beyond 
the Diag should be.”

Jones said she hopes through-

out the next year, her office and 
CSG can work together to ensure 
these programs continue to grow 
and evolve.

Much of the meeting was 

spent 
allocating 
responsibili-

ties and community initiatives 
to specific committees. Several 
new members of CSG stressed 
the importance of keeping their 
campaign promises, specifically 
their goal to increase the assem-
bly’s transparency.

Initiatives discussed include 

plans 
to 
increase 
outreach 

through social media, as well as 
implement regular coffee cart 
conversations where CSG repre-
sentatives are positioned around 
campus to interact with students

lisabeth Kübler-Ross’ 1969 
book “On Death and Dying” 
proposed a new and revo-

lutionary 
model 

for predicting the 
emotions 
associ-

ated with loss and 
tragedy in human 
beings — we know 
it today as the “five stages of grief.” 
Ross’s model has been modified since 
its original publication to include 
potential grief-causing life events less 
traumatic than losing a loved one. I 
suppose Ross didn’t expect that anoth-
er source of grief could eventually be 
freshman-year dorm assignments, of 
all things.

A common question among stu-

dents when socializing both in and 
outside of class begins with the ever-
popular “where are you living?” 
It’s a question that can turn into a 
moment of bonding or elecit a sigh of 
jelousy, especially when one’s living 
situation is completely out of their 
control, as is the case with freshmen 
and many sophomores.

Acclimating to college is arguably 

one of the biggest transitions we stu-
dents will face in our lives. We learn 
to become independent while find-
ing a happy medium between work 
and school. Our living situation is 
crucial to success on both sides of 
this balance. Ideally, we would want 
to both focus and relax, which is 
hard to do with a small room and 
person we’ve never met before. And 
with most students entering the 
housing system blindly, all we can do 
is hope and pray that we somehow 
end up with a carbon copy of our-
selves for a roommate. So, as we are 
forced to wait for contracts to come 
out, we do what any rational human 
being would do in our situation. We 
begin the paranoia.

Words that were once centered 

around things like “organized” 
and “clean” and “goes to bed at a 
respectable time” shift and morph 
into more realistic things like, “Will 
her boyfriend be a problem?” or “Is 
this girl a psychopath?” It’s a never-
ending cycle of unlikely situations 
that we use to torture ourselves just 
enough to prepare for the worst. 
Thus, housing becomes probably 
the most painful torture device in 
the dungeons of our mind.

At this point, I am not afraid to 

admit that the thought of ending up 
on North Campus kept me awake at 

night as soon as contracts began to 
be released. In possibly the biggest 
first-world problem ever phrased, 
I was worried about getting to the 
closest Starbucks without taking a 
bus to feed my late-night cravings. 
You heard me right. So I thanked 
whatever deity had taken pity on 
this anxiety-ridden college fresh-
man when the words “North Cam-
pus” did not appear on my housing 
contract. I began a happy dance, 
subsequently stopping dead in my 
tracks when a thought occurred — 
where on Earth was Mary Mark-
ley Hall? It was at that point I went 
through what I now refer to as “The 
Five Stages of Residence Hall Grief.”

The first stage was denial. I had 

looked up the residence hall in which I 
was to spend my first year of college in 
and I was in utter, complete denial. So 
much so that I refreshed the browser 
twice and read the assignment out 
loud just to make sure I wasn’t hal-
lucinating or having a nightmare or 
anything. It was insane and I was 
insane for acting like a spoiled child 
for those first few moments. I didn’t 
care that I was going to a top univer-
sity or that my roommate and I might 
immediately hit it off, as we eventu-
ally did, or even that I didn’t end up on 
North Campus because in my mind, 
I was even more isolated than North 
Campus would have put me. So my 
denial morphed into anger and I blew 
a fuse — a really big fuse.

To put it lightly, I was frustrated. 

To put it heavily, I was absolutely 
furious. At orientation, we were 
smothered with the lush, glimmer-
ing newness of East Quad Residence 
Hall and here I was, stuck in an older 
dorm that was both seemingly iso-
lated from the excitement of Central 
Campus life and full of cockroaches. 
I was angry when the showers were 
full, when the morning walk to class 
took 15 minutes and when I visited a 
dorm that was nicer than mine. Why 
me? No, seriously. Why me? Deep 
down, I knew I was overreacting, but 
at the moment, I really didn’t care. I 
just wanted that shiny, new drywall 
and those polished wood floors.

Bargaining, the second stage of 

grief, began when I first saw the 
cramped 10-by-12-foot room that 
would become my home for the next 
eight months. I subsequently lost 
whatever optimism I had recovered 
right there and then. Maybe I could 
switch? No big deal, problem solved. 

Except I couldn’t switch. With this 
realization began the self-blaming 
period. Maybe if I had been smart 
enough to make Honors, I could 
have lived in South Quad Residence 
Hall. If I had known I wanted to do 
language, I could have lived in East 
Quad. I was beginning to lose my 
anger, only to have it shift into blame.

Depression, the fourth stage, 

began immediately when my but-
terfly chair wouldn’t fit anywhere 
in the room. Something that was 
once again silly somehow released 
the frustration that had been build-
ing throughout the weeks before 
college. I had said goodbye to my 
family and said hello to an empty 
room, awaiting the arrival of my 
roommate in solitude as I half-
heartedly unpacked to the droning 
songs of Pandora.

Acceptance, the final stage, was 

the hardest and therefore came 
slowly, creeping up on the edge of my 
mind throughout the first few weeks 
until I couldn’t recall anything prior 
to the new happiness I had built for 
myself. This last stage became a hall 
full of wonderful girls; a fake speak-
easy in the lounge; watching the sea-
sons change outside my oversized 
window; falling asleep watching 
movies lit by a 13-inch screen and 
bagel runs on cold Sunday mornings. 
Acceptance began with friends and 
never ended.

The five stages of grief applied 

to my living situation in a big way. 
It enabled me to form an opinion 
and false idea of what my freshman 
year in Markley would be like before 
I had even moved in. In reality, 
acceptance was the only stage that 
mattered. The rest of the stages are 
faraway memories now, remnants of 
a time of weakness and selfishness 
that I can hardly even remember. 
We all hope to get that one dorm, 
that one room that we map out per-
fectly and mentally decorate, so 
when we end up with something 
completely different, it catches us 
off guard. The best thing to do is to 
grieve, to go through all the stages 
of grief until you get the negativity 
out of your system so you can finally 
accept your situation and learn to 
make the best of it. After all, you’re 
only a freshman once.

Cupcakes, salad and balance

W

hile scrolling through 
Instagram a few weeks 
ago, 
envying 
those 

who already had 
returned to Ann 
Arbor 
before 

Welcome Week, I 
laughed at a pic-
ture of the words: 
“Some days you 
eat salads and go 
to the gym, some 
days you eat cup-
cakes and refuse 
to put on pants. 
It’s 
called 
bal-

ance.” Five minutes later, I received 
a text from my older sister with a 
screenshot of the same exact post, 
followed by a “hahahahahahahaha” 
and a couple of crying-from-laughter 
emojis. The reason we were laugh-
ing so hard? Those 24 words pretty 
much sum up everything that I can 
say about staying healthy in college.

In all seriousness, personal health 

— regarding physical activity and 
nutrition — is an area that I have 
grown into over time. As with many 
other people, I grew up athletic. 
From figure skating to 10 years of 
competitive gymnastics and a few 
short stints in ballet and diving, I 
spent anywhere from 10 to 20 hours 
per week in a gym. After high school, 
I rode my accelerated metabolism for 
at least a year before I felt any dif-
ferent. I’ve never trusted scales or 
counted calories because, for me, it is 
a lot more than how my clothes fit or 
what I see in the mirror or any num-
ber that represents how “healthy” I 
am. Instead, it is the feeling I get in 
the pit of my stomach after knowing I 
am not fueling my body in the correct 
way or moving enough to keep my 
muscles strong.

At first I wholeheartedly resent-

ed the idea of forming new eating 
habits, and maybe this was because 
my sister was overly strict about 
what she ate. Her habits made me 
believe the concept of a healthy 
diet involved things like cutting out 
entire food groups. At this point, 
she and I were on polar-opposite 
ends of the nutrition spectrum, and 
I believe that together, we helped 
each other meet in the middle. 
Eventually, I found my way back to 
a fitness routine that now keeps me 
excited to go back to the gym. Full 
disclosure: I had a giant bowl of mint 
chocolate chip ice cream for lunch 
today, so I cannot claim to have it 
completely figured out. No one does, 
but as a wise Instagram photo once 
said, “It’s called balance.”

Balance can be a tricky thing to 

find in college, especially at a uni-
versity as difficult as Michigan. 
Classes are tough, and finding a 
place to study during finals is even 
tougher. For a long time, I used the 
excuse that I didn’t have the time to 
exercise. Time to do anything other 
than eat, sleep and study was a pre-
cious resource that, when I found, I 
sometimes forgot what to do with. If 
I had time to exercise, didn’t I actu-
ally have the time to study more? 
Exercising must be a waste of that 
precious resource. And nutrition? 
How can I be expected to make 
healthy eating choices at 2 a.m., 
when I’m staring into the case at 
Bert’s, deciding between the double 
chocolate chip muffin and an apple? 
Muffins go better with coffee; that’s 
all I have to say about that.

The thing is, this all-or-nothing 

health and fitness attitude is not in 
anyone’s best interest. There’s a time 
for salads and there’s a time for cup-
cakes, we just have to be self-aware 
enough to know which time is which. 

It’s true, however, that a cupcake a 
day will certainly not keep the doc-
tor away. In order to physically and 
mentally stand up to the tasks pre-
sented in the classroom, steps toward 
a healthier lifestyle need to be taken 
outside of it.

A 2015 study conducted by Maite 

Pellicer-Chenoll et al. demonstrated 
that high-energy expenditure and 
good physical fitness of students was 
associated with low BMI and high 
academic performance. It is true, 
however, that better academic per-
formance may not be solely explained 
by physical activity and that there 
are other variables involved. One 
perspective is that attitude and moti-
vation toward physical activity also, 
in a larger sense, play a role in deter-
mining an individual’s outlook on 
academics. The catch is that physical 
activity can perpetuate this motiva-
tion, which, in turn, can lead to better 
academic performance.

Although scientific evidence can 

be reassuring, I believe that to see 
the positive results of healthy deci-
sions, we don’t even have to look as 
far as research. I recommend this: 
Instead of using your study break to 
watch reruns on Netflix, work out for 
an hour. Before you go for a third cup 
of coffee, try going to sleep and wak-
ing up an hour earlier to finish your 
paper. Take a few seconds to reflect 
on what your body is telling you, and 
compare it to how you’ve felt in the 
past. When are you more efficient? 
When do you feel less stressed? When 
do you feel happier about where you 
are academically, socially, mentally 
and physically? Maybe today it’s a 
cupcake, but tomorrow it’s salad and 
the gym.

Good evening, nation

B

efore the finales of “Friends” and 
“Seinfeld,” of “Lost” and “How I 
Met Your Mother,” one of the biggest 

endings in television his-
tory had 50 million Ameri-
cans eagerly tuned in. In 
1992, ending 30 years in 
the spotlight as a cultural 
and comedic icon, the god-king of late night, 
Johnny Carson, sat on a stool and bid his audi-
ence “a very heartfelt goodnight.” Two weeks 
later, a charismatic Arkansas governor made 
an appearance on “The Arsenio Hall Show,” 
playing “Heartbreak Hotel” on the saxo-
phone on his way to becoming President Bill 
Clinton. It’s been almost a quarter-century, 
and the relationship between late-night tele-
vision and politics has never been the same.

Under Carson, “The Tonight Show” on NBC 

had always been an apolitical haven. Johnny 
religiously avoided inviting political figures 
onto his stage, mentioning his own ideologi-
cal stances or influencing his viewers in any 
way. This all changed with his successor, Jay 
Leno, who regularly hosted political figures 
during his tenure. At the turn of the century, 
the political gaffes of the Bush administra-
tion proved low-hanging fruit for nascent pro-
grams like “The Daily Show,” “Real Time with 
Bill Maher” and, later, “The Colbert Report.” 
David Letterman routinely discussed politics, 
especially during the Iraq War. Political satire 
was in its golden age, from Tina Fey’s impres-
sion of Sarah Palin on “Saturday Night Live” to 
President Obama’s frequent visits to late-night 
programs (nine as of March 2015).

For most current undergraduate students, 

the first election for which they fully under-
stood the circus that dominated news, conver-
sation and television was in 2008. For every 
election since, there has been one constant — 
skits, caricature, impressions and a never-end-
ing supply of mockery. Of the more than four 
million viewers who loyally tuned in to “The 
Daily Show” and “The Colbert Report,” Nielsen 
ratings show an audience that was consistently 
young and consistently male, which is a diffi-
cult-to-reach but influential demographic.

Last Tuesday marked the end to months of 

flux in late-night television, a changing of the 
guard. “The Late Show” on CBS has a famil-
iar face, but with a hint of uncertainty. Colbert 
has broken character, but is it forever? Does 
he have the same freedom for political evis-
ceration that he had on cable? Will he use it? 
Stewart and Colbert left us with Wilmore and 
Noah. Only Jimmy Kimmel seemed to stay in 
place, and his politics remain a mystery.

In the span of a few months, the late-night 

locker room has done a complete overhaul, 
sporting a new roster, one that is comparative-
ly vanilla when it comes to politics. Granted, 
a lot remains to be seen. But if the first three 
months of Larry Wilmore’s “The Nightly 
Show” is any indication, Comedy Central has 
lost two all-stars for a rookie and a wildcard.

Some have exaggerated the bond between 

millennial politics and television, referring 
to Jon Stewart as this generation’s Walter 
Cronkite, but that is a step too far. “The Daily 

Show” never claimed to be a source of news or 
tried to win the trust of its viewers; it simply 
acted as a compass. When something notable 
(or noticeably ridiculous) was going on in 
the world, Stewart, Colbert and Letterman 
pointed in its direction and laughed. Millen-
nials across the political spectrum could laugh 
with them, or at the very least appreciate their 
craft (which is not so much the case with John 
Oliver’s very loud and very liberal crusade on 
HBO).

So what does this mean for the nearly 80 

million millennials, nearly all of whom will 
be of voting age in 2016? For starters, take into 
account that according to the Pew Research 
Center, 50 percent of them consider them-
selves independents, compared to only 39 per-
cent of Generation X and 37 percent of Baby 
Boomers. Then, add the fact that 70 percent 
of millennial Facebook users read articles 
posted by other users on a regular basis and 42 
percent frequently post or share news stories 
themselves. Now, the curveball — less than a 
quarter of millennials actually vote.

If any one candidate were to motivate and 

capture this huge demographic at least in part, 
they would immediately be a contender for 
a major party’s nomination. But this will be 
difficult if late night doesn’t step up, if clips of 
tirades from Stewart, Letterman and Colbert 
(in character) are not being shared on the web. 
We can no longer expect to see headlines like 
“Watch Jon Stewart Eviscerate Fox News on 
Last Night’s Daily Show.” Americans cannot 
expect a political medium that a generation 
has known for all their lives be deprived of its 
politically charged founders with no effect.

Make no mistake, millennials will not be 

able to escape the 2016 presidential buzz. Twit-
ter will be taken over by every primary debate, 
candidates have invaded Snapchat and Hillary 
Clinton hit the whip and the nae nae on The 
Ellen DeGeneres Show just last week. Candi-
dates (and their campaign managers) are mak-
ing attempts to appeal to a young audience, but 
without familiar voices discussing the issues 
every night, will anyone really listen?

Entering 2016, look for the candidate who 

can replicate what late-night comedians did 
so well for more than a decade, exciting people 
about otherwise dry, lifeless politics. Look for 
the candidate who can rise above “Trumpma-
nia” and become a focal point in monologues 
from Conan and Kimmel.

Of course, there is the distinct possibility 

that without late night at the helm, millen-
nials twist away in the wind next year, that 
a 23-percent voter turnout in 2014 becomes 
20 percent or less in 2016. The much more 
interesting prospect, however, is that with-
out their political compass, millennials use 
every bit of their social media acumen, love 
of crowdfunding and demographic weight to 
shake things up and make this election year a 
dogfight for their attention.

Speaking as a millennial, that option 

sounds pretty good to me.

‘America’ paints 
millenial portrait

Strongest work yet 
from Baumbach 

and Gerwig

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

As students and future success-

ful people, we all see college as a 
time to be unique, but most often 
we emulate peo-
ple we admire 
to develop our 
own identities. 
In 
“Mistress 

America,” 
the 

hilariously well-
scripted second 
collaboration 
between Noah 
Baumbach 
(“Kicking and Screaming”) and 
Greta Gerwig (“Frances Ha”), a 
lonely college freshman finds her 
role model in an older sister figure.

Though initially reluctant to 

involve herself in her mother’s 
impending marriage, Tracy (Lola 
Kirke, “Gone Girl”) meets her 
soon-to-be 
stepsister, 
Brooke 

(Greta Gerwig). Whereas Tracy is 
the archetype of precocious-but-
naïve-Faulkner-name-dropping 
English major, Brooke, 10 years 
older, trailblazes the path to the 
yuppie paradise that lies in Tra-
cy’s future. Brooke crackles with 
hyperactivity energy, hurling out 
neatly-packaged Twitticisms and 
drunken life anecdotes with dead-
pan timing that would make Lore-

lai Gilmore bow at her feet. She’s 
essentially the Manic Pixie Dream 
Girl grown up. In between teach-
ing Soul Cycle sessions and sing-
ing on stage with a band, Brooke 
dreams up plans for a restaurant-
slash-market-slash 
community 

center that also moonlights as a 
yoga center on Tuesdays, and if 
that doesn’t work out, she has this 
amazing TV show idea, and oh, 
there’s this really rich guy from 
high school who is totally still in 
love with her, ya know?

 Tracy doesn’t actually know, 

but she eagerly jumps into 
Brooke’s life with infatuated 
admiration. She finds Brooke so 
compelling that she writes a story 
about her and takes every chance 
she can get to stay overnight at 
Brooke’s fancy apartment and 
tag along to concerts and busi-
ness meetings galore. Eventu-
ally, Tracy helps Brooke turn her 
restaurant idea into reality, and 
in true Brooke-fashion, it’s an 
eccentric adventure.

 The characters are parodies 

and real people all at the same 
time, 
masterfully 
assembled. 

They’re not forced out of their 
stereotypes unnaturally, à la 
High School Musical’s “Stick 
to the Status Quo” (“I bake!”), 
which lacks subtlety and, to some 
extent, realism. Though Tracy 
idolizes Brooke’s charisma and 
supports her almost uncondition-
ally, she recognizes that Brooke 
can’t go through her whole adult 
life bearing this youthful ban-
ner. Even the supposed enemy 

in the film, Brooke’s high school 
nemesis whose life is the picture 
perfect image of “boring” white 
picket fence type success, adds 
a much-needed dose of real-
ity to Brooke’s erratic antics. 
Refreshingly, 
neither 
Brooke 

nor Tracy eradicates her flaws 
over the course of the film, but 
rather learn to recognize them 
and accept them regardless. The 
film doesn’t tie everything up in a 
bow; the characters end as works 
in progress. It feels almost sweet-
er this way, that they receive a 
happy resolution but don’t have 
to be perfect or end a life chapter 
to do it.

 In the final scene, which cou-

ples heartwarming sisterly love 
with Tracy’s overwrought prose 
for one last joke, I didn’t feel the 
buoyant warm and fuzzies I’ve 
come to associate with Baum-
bach/Gerwig 
collaborations. 

There is actually quite a bit of 
character depth, but the script is 
so self-aware (and aware that it’s 
self-aware) that the satire often 
overwhelms emotion. 

 Still, the script is witty 

enough to hold its ground. 
Before “Mistress America” hit 
the scene, “Frances Ha” was 
arguably Baumbach and Ger-
wig’s best work to date, both as 
individuals and collaborators. 
But now, the duo takes all the 
razor-sharp wit that they’ve 
previously been known for and 
amps it up for a delightful romp 
through a developing sisterly 
relationship.

“What the fuck grandma?!?!”
‘The Visit’ not as bad 
as one might expect

By BENJAMIN ROSENSTOCK

Daily Arts Writer

Many horror movies, like 

“Paranormal 
Activity” 
and 

this year’s “The Gift,” follow 
the same for-
mula. 
The 

protagonists 
first 
encoun-

ter 
some-

thing slightly 
unusual 
and 

brush it off. 
With 
each 

passing 
day, 

stranger 
things begin to happen, and 
it becomes impossible to dis-
miss the series of events. By the 
last act, the film has built up a 
steady growth of subtle threats 
until a climax of violence and 
general insanity.

“The Visit,” the newest hor-

ror movie written and directed 
by M. Night Shyamalan (“The 
Sixth Sense”), sticks to this 
common 
schematic, 
bearing 

resemblance to “Paranormal 
Activity” both with its found 
footage style and its method 
of 
juxtaposing 
eerie 
night-

time shots and bright morning 
scenes. In “Paranormal Activ-
ity,” morning scenes allowed 
the viewer to breathe a sigh of 
relief after the high tension of 
the night. In “The Visit,” unfor-
tunately, each morning signals 
another tedious wait until the 
next burst of plot movement. 
While the thrills of “Paranor-
mal Activity” were enough to 
inspire dread for the next night, 
the thrills of “The Visit” spark 
little suspense.

The film follows young ama-

teur filmmaker Becca (Olivia 
DeJonge, “Hiding”) and her 
obnoxious little brother Tyler 
(Ed Oxenbould, “Alexander and 
the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, 
Very Bad Day”) as they spend a 
week with their grandparents. 
Becca and Tyler’s mother, Paula 
(Kathryn 
Hahn, 
“Transpar-

ent”), had a falling out with her 
parents after a fight years ago. 

Becca, filming the visit docu-
mentary-style, hopes to find an 
“elixir” — some sign of forgive-
ness that will lead Paula to rec-
oncile with her parents.

The emotional crux of the 

film rests on Becca and Tyler’s 
attempts to help their mother, 
all the while agonizing over 
the father who left them years 
ago. In the middle of the film, 
the horror element is dropped 
almost entirely in favor of a 
sequence 
where 
Becca 
and 

Tyler conduct talking head 
interviews with each other. 
Tyler, after spending most of 
the movie cracking wise jokes 
and rapping terribly, bashfully 
admits he feels responsible for 
their father’s abandonment. In 
Becca’s interview, Tyler calls 
her out for an insecurity she 
has never mentioned. It’s a pair 
of scenes that carries a surpris-
ing amount of emotional heft, 
and in a sea of talentless child 
actors, DeJonge and Oxenbould 
create a sibling relationship 
that feels authentic.

Unfortunately, 
the 
osten-

sible primary plot of the movie, 
involving 
Becca’s 
quest 
for 

the “elixir,” is more of a glo-
rified subplot in service of a 
fairly by-the-numbers horror 
story. In between cheap jump 
scares, there aren’t many gen-
uine thrills to go around. For 
most of the movie, Shyamalan 
makes the interesting choice to 
ground most of the grandpar-
ents’ creepy moments in prob-
lems many elderly people run 
into instead of demonic malevo-
lence. Nana (Deanna Dunagan, 
“August: Osage County”) stum-
bles around the house in the 

middle of the night in confusion, 
showing symptoms of demen-
tia. Pop Pop (Peter McRobbie, 
“Lincoln”) has a stash of soiled 
diapers hidden away as a result 
of his incontinence. There is 
an element of creepiness to the 
sight of Nana projectile vomit-
ing in the middle of the night 
and the shot of Pop Pop stick-
ing a gun into his own mouth, 
but it rarely feels dangerous. If 
the problem is simply that these 
people are getting old and con-
fused, what physical threat do 
they actually pose?

Luckily, there’s a Shyama-

lan twist waiting to kick off the 
third act that shows the true 
danger of the scenario, and once 
it’s revealed, the film finally 
kicks it into high gear, descend-
ing into all-out lunacy. Finally, 
the elements of dark humor 
that the beginning of the movie 
hinted at come out in full force. 
In one inspired scene, Becca 
and Tyler sit and nervously play 
a game of Yahtzee with their 
grandparents, and there’s no 
pretending that it’s just a normal 
family game night. It’s a marvel-
ous scene, both hilarious and 
tense, and every scene thereaf-
ter combines those conflicting 
tones brilliantly.

There’s a time and place for 

atmosphere and slow build-
ups, but “The Visit” shows that, 
like action, horror can often be 
at its most fun when the story 
stops stalling and the filmmak-
ers start having fun. The film 
ends on a solid note, but it’s dif-
ficult not to wish less time was 
spent on “old people problems” 
and more on the true horror 
beneath the surface.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK
Five songs I should 
have heard before 

By RACHEL KERR

Daily Arts Writer

I’d like to think I’m pretty 
 

“with it” when it comes to music; 
I frequently check blogs, skim 
through Reddit, scour the Inter-
net for leaks, etc. But, sometimes 
stuff slips through the cracks 
and doesn’t reveal itself until my 
friend is giving me shit because, 
how have you not heard about 
this band/artist/song? Once the 
embarrassment 
subsides 
and 

the how the fuck did I miss this? 
moment passes, you probably have 
some pretty good tracks to catch 
up on, like I did with these.

“Baby”– Ariel Pink’s Haunt-

ed Graffiti

Ariel Pink’s dreamy 2012 cover 

of Joe and Donnie Emerson’s 
“Baby” popped up on a friend’s 
Spotify playlist earlier this sum-
mer, and I’ve since described it as 
the “perfect song.” It’s warm but 
cloudy, mysterious but satisfying, 
contemporary but nostalgic. And 
Pink’s sultry vocals take the track 
to new heights, hit-single wise and 
new-depths, heart wise. 

“Codeine Crazy”– Future
Sorry, but I had to throw this 

one on here because I have half 
ironically, half un-ironically been 
calling “Codeine Crazy” the best 
song of 2015, even though it tech-
nically dropped almost a year ago 
on Future’s 2014 mixtape, Mon-
ster. What works about the track 
is it’s versatility — it can be both a 
banger and a ballad. Never before 
have I heard the phrase “I just took 

a bitch to eat at Chipotle” sound so 
sentimental.

“Gardenhead / Leave Me 

Alone”– Neutral Milk Hotel
Most Neutral Milk Hotel fans, 

when prompted, will rave about 
their 1998 album In the Aeroplane 
Over The Sea. It’s deeply loved by 
indie fans and indie critics alike; 
Pitchfork gave it a perfect 10/10 – 
not to say Pitchfork is the ultimate 
authority, but hey, it still means 
something. Fans of the group are 
much less familiar with On Avery 
Island, the album that preceded 
their magnum opus. However, this 
track hinted at the gold Neutral 
Milk Hotel would soon strike, at 
the potential they were about to 
unlock. 

“In Dreams”– tomemisu 

I found this gem hidden at the 

end of an episode of the web series 
“High Maintenance” (thank God 

I always watch the credits) and I 
haven’t been the same since. When 
almost every verse begins with 
“when I look around my heart … 
” it’s impossible not to get senti-
mental. Its bedroom-y feel is only 
accentuated by the low-quality 
recording, in which you even hear 
a chime from the artists cell phone 
if you listen close enough. Talk 
about intimate. 

“Beach Community”– Joyce 

Manor

I don’t know what I was doing 

in 2011, but I know what I should 
have been doing in 2011: listen-
ing to more Joyce Manor. I heard 
their self-titled LP in high school 
but never really gave it more than 
a listen or two. Maybe I’m angstier 
than I was at 16, but this shit really 
resonates with me now. The post-
punk ballad is loud and angry and 
that’s just how I like it.

percent in 2006 to 35 percent 
in 2014.

“The proportion of people 

both college age and adolescent, 
for that matter, who see mari-
juana use as dangerous has been 
declining fairly sharply,” John-
ston said. “I think that almost 
always leads to more use. Con-
versely, if we see an increase 
in perceived risk, that usually 
leads to less use. I think the key 
belief about whether it’s dan-
gerous or not has been changing 
a lot. I think that has contribut-
ed considerably, if not totally, to 
the increase in daily use.”

LSA junior Ian Vamossy, 

assistant director of the Uni-
versity’s chapter of Students 
for Sensible Drug Policy, said 
University students now see 
marijuana in a similar light as 
alcohol — a perception that has 
helped make marijuana use 
among students more common. 
He said the “War on Drugs” 
has failed, and hopes for a more 
open approach to drug policy in 

the future.

“I just think the stigma is 

finally breaking overall,” he 
said. “People know that it’s not 
necessarily healthy, but it’s less 
damaging than tobacco. I think 
a lot of the people who grew up 
in the Reagan administration 
with ‘just say no’ are growing 
up and finally realizing that it’s 
not the right way to go about it.”

An LSA sophomore inter-

viewed by The Michigan Daily 
said she uses marijuana recre-
ationally and enjoys the social 
aspect of smoking. The student 
was granted anonymity due to 
the sensitive nature of the topic.

She also noted Ann Arbor’s 

relative openness to marijuana 
compared to other communities.

“The local people are already 

comfortable with having dispen-
saries on the main streets and 
hosting something like Hash 
Bash, which has been around 
since the ’70s,” she said. “It’s 
always been the culture of Ann 
Arbor that it’s not a detrimental 
part of their society. Weed is so 
widespread, and as widespread 
as alcohol is in other places. The 
liberal vibe of Ann Arbor is what 

keeps it going.”

Another finding: daily ciga-

rette 
use 
has 
significantly 

decreased, from a 19 percent 
usage rate in 1999 to a 5 percent 
usage rate in 2014.

Johnston said a number of 

young marijuana users are grap-
pling with poor mental health, 
and, in turn, look to marijuana 
as a coping mechanism.

“Probably a disproportion-

ate number of those users are 
dealing with depression or psy-
chological conditions and using 
marijuana to escape their feel-
ings,” Johnston said. “That’s not 
the only reason, but I think that’s 
got to be part of that population.”

The LSA sophomore inter-

viewed by the Daily said an 
increasingly prominent con-
versation about marijuana may 
pave the way for more wide-
spread use.

“I think people are realizing 

that the effects aren’t as bad 
as our government has tried to 
show us with making it illegal,” 
she said. “People are more will-
ing to try smoking, and then 
as more people do, it becomes 
more accessible.”

am completely open to that idea.”

Currently, 
the 
University’s 

schools and colleges are strongly 
encouraged to have 15 percent of 
their classes take place on Fri-
day, based on a 2012 plan that 
restructured how the University 
scheduled rooms to better make 
use classroom space. The plan 
included adding classes on Fri-
day, as well as more classes dur-
ing non-peak times — 9 a.m., 12 
p.m., 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.

Currently, the Fall 2015 under-

graduate LSA course guide lists 
809 courses that have at least one 
of their class days on Friday.

How a change like this might 

actually be implemented varies, 
Pollack said.

“When 
we 
implemented 

the (2012 plan), it was a policy 
that came from the provost’s 
office,” she said. “It wasn’t an 
absolute demand — you must 
do it — but we said to the deans, 
‘These are targets and every 
year, when you come in for your 
budget meeting, we’re gonna 
look to see how you’re doing on 
your targets. So that would be 
one approach. If it came out of 
SACUA, it could be the faculty 
themselves saying, we want to 
have this. There are just differ-
ent ways it could happen.”

In terms of other ways aca-

demic policy could impact excess 
student drinking, Pollack noted 
that faculty members have also 

proposed the idea of discuss-
ing the issue in the classroom. 
The University recently released 
several policy efforts to address 
alcohol abuse.

At Monday’s SACUA meet-

ing, several professors suggested 
ways to approach the issue in an 
academic setting, such as tell-
ing students about alcohol-free 
events on campus.

“That’s the place where what 

goes on in the classroom has to 
come from the faculty,” Pollack 
said. “They’re the ones who have 
the expertise and knowledge and 
know what’s appropriate and not 
appropriate. I would not require 
faculty members to address it 
in the classroom, but I would 
be supportive of it and provide 
information.”

EPISODE REVIEW

 “Masters of Sex” has passed 
the midpoint of its season, 
but the show still lacks direc-
tion. Thankfully, “Masters” 
has retired 
some of the 
ridiculous 
plotlines 
that plagued 
earlier 
episodes of 
the season 
(hello, 
boob-grab-
bing zoo 
gorilla) and stopped trying to 
make us care about Virginia’s 
teen daughter — but the show 
has some work to do if it’s ever 
going to be good enough to 
deserve Josh Charles.
 “Masters” is seldom suc-
cessful in handling its endless 
roster of side characters and 
subplots, but somehow, guest 
actors like the aforementioned 
Josh Charles keep signing up to 
be on this show. Emily Kinney 
(“The Walking Dead”) plays 
Nora Everett, an old neighbor 
of Bill’s who joins Bill’s sex 
study as a “surrogate” to help 
men with erectile dysfunc-

tion. Knowing that Nora was 
an old neighbor of Bill’s and he 
hasn’t seen her since she was 
a child, their flirty student/
teacher relationship is deeply 
creepy — and it doesn’t help 
that Kinney’s youthful appear-
ance makes her look very, very 
underage.
 Legendary comedian Sarah 
Silverman doesn’t get much to 
do aside from wanting a baby, 
and actual full-time cast mem-
ber Caitlin FitzGerald (“Adult 
Beginners”) hasn’t been grant-
ed an interesting storyline for 

Libby in almost two seasons.
 “Higher Anxiety” provides 
standard fare for an episode 
of “Masters of Sex” — obvious 
relationship metaphors, poorly-
drawn female characters, 
beautiful production design and 
period costumes that almost dis-
tract from the bad writing — but 
“Masters” as usual is not good 
enough to properly honor the 
show’s excellent cast. Get your 
act together, “Masters of Sex.” 
For the love of Josh Charles.

TRAILER REVIEW

 M. Night, bro, what the hell?
It’s not even that I want your 
trailers to be effective anymore. 
I just don’t 
want to 
laugh where 
you expect 
me to be 
disturbed, or 
even a little 
curious. It 
makes me 
feel terrible. You deserve so 
much respect for your first 
two features, but I can’t jus-
tify respecting you. Your films 
make money, but I cannot call 
you a success. “The Visit,” being 
produced by the same guy that 
has produced every single other 
mainstream American horror 
film (“Paranormal Activity,” 
“Insidious,” “Sinister”) — looks 
like brand recognition rather 
than an attempt at a comeback. 
After “The Sixth Sense,” we 
unfairly expected the next big 
thing, and yet you delivered 

with “Unbreakable.” One could 
argue the merits of “Signs” if 
he really put his mind to it. But 
those years are long gone. In 
the last 10 years, you’ve graced 
us with your abominations 
“The Happening” and “The 
Last Airbender” and “After 
Earth” and “Devil.” And the 
trailer alone for each of those 
films indicated the poor qual-
ity of those movies. Can’t you 

at least deliver a trailer with a 
ray of sunshine? Can’t you learn 
from your mistakes?
 Do not see this movie. Do not 
make M. Night think he’s still 
relevant. Do not give him your 
money. Watch the trailer so 
you can laugh at Granny asking, 
“Can you get in the oven, dear?” 
But that’s it. No more.

Penn State mistakes fuel 
Stribling even as a starter

By JAKE LOURIM 

Managing Sports Editor

Junior cornerback Channing 

Stribling was speaking to the 
media Tuesday night about his 
past issues with consistency, 
about his lack of focus, about 
getting stronger and faster.

He 
talked 
about 
proving 

himself and keeping his head up. 
It was clear he was avoiding a big 
elephant in the room.

“I’m assuming you’re talking 

about Penn State,” a reporter said.

“Yeah, of course,” Stribling said 

with a wry smile. “Penn State.”

The 
cornerback 
recalls 

immediately 
the 
game 
in 

question. It was the low point of 
his career, a night game in State 
College on Oct. 12, 2013. He still 
watches the film at least once a 
month.

“It’s still with me,” Stribling 

said. “It’s just knowing what 
mistakes I made, knowing that 
if I get the same play, it won’t 
happen again.”

That night, the No. 18 Michigan 

football team rolled into Happy 
Valley at 5-0. The Wolverines led, 
34-27, with 45 seconds left. Penn 
State had the ball on first down 
at its own 34-yard line. Stribling, 
then a true freshman, was in at 
cornerback, matched up on the 
strong side with Penn State’s 
Brandon Felder.

Nittany 
Lions 
quarterback 

Christian 
Hackenberg 
took 

the snap, evaded the pressure, 
stepped up and threw down 
the right sideline to Felder. 
Stribling mistimed his jump at 
the Michigan 40-yard line and 
tipped it to Felder, who fell down 
with the ball at the 37.

Penn State rushed to the 

line and spiked the ball with 35 

seconds to play. On the next play, 
Stribling lined up on the weak 
side opposite the Nittany Lions’ 
top receiver, Allen Robinson.

Again 
Hackenberg 
threw 

downfield to Robinson, and again 
Stribling mistimed his jump. 
Robinson, standing near the goal 
line, jumped and pulled down the 
pass over Stribling at the one-yard 
line — Stribling’s mistake again.

Penn State punched in the 

game-tying touchdown two plays 
later, and four gut-wrenching 
overtimes after that, the Nittany 
Lions won, 43-40. The rest is 
history: Brady Hoke’s Michigan 
team lost five of its next seven 
games to end the season.

Stribling knows what he did 

wrong on each of his mistakes 
that night. On the first, he lost 
the ball in the lights and should 
have reached up higher to bat 
the ball down. On the second, 
he misjudged Hackenberg’s arm 
strength and let the ball sail over 
his head.

“Everybody says (Robinson) 

ripped the ball out, but it really 
was on me the most,” Stribling 
said. “That’s why it hurt the 
most — because it was mostly me 
misjudging the ball instead of 
him just making a great catch. Of 
course it was a great catch, but it 
was mainly on me misjudging the 
ball.”

Whenever Stribling watches 

the film of that night, he recalls 
his mistakes. Defensive backs 
have to have a short memory, and 
Stribling does.

But in this regard, he wants to 

remember. He wants that night to 
stick with him, so that he can be 
better for it.

“It’s 
just 
to 
watch 
and 

remember and make sure that 
next time if it happens, I’m 

focused,” Stribling said. “It’s 
in the back of my head to make 
sure you do this and that. It’s not 
(thinking) I could have done this 
or that.”

His problems since his true 

freshman year have been with 
consistency, or lack thereof. He 
has had good days, then bad ones.

He knew he had to fix that to 

become the cornerback he is this 
year. He has earned the first two 
starts of his career in Michigan’s 
first two games this season, 
emerging from a deep crop of 
defensive backs in competition.

To avoid repeating the mistakes 

he made two years ago, Stribling 
would have to focus better. In 
fact, he used the word “focus” 
nine times in a seven-minute 
interview Tuesday — a sign that it 
has become his greatest emphasis.

“You don’t understand how 

much effort and focus I put into 
this season itself,” Stribling said. 
“It’s so much effort.”

He used to come home from 

practice, watch TV and relax. 
Now it’s all football: He comes 
home, watches film, eats and 
watches more film.

All of it goes into making sure 

2013 doesn’t happen again. He 
was in spot duty that night, but he 
isn’t anymore. Michigan counts 
on him more now as a starter, so 
he knows he has to be stronger.

“You make a mistake, you’re 

good, just make sure it doesn’t 
happen again,” Stribling said. 
“Make sure you make the play.”

It was a long process for 

Stribling to earn that trust 
again, and he didn’t initially 
know how long it would take. He 
admitted sometimes he would 
overestimate his progress.

“Yeah, sometimes, it’s always 

like that,” Stribling said. “You 

always think you’re right, and 
the coaches are like, ‘No, you’re 
not.’ It’s just a matter of just 
growing up, staying focused and 
understanding that the coaches 
are on you the most because they 
believe in you and they know that 
you can do great things. It’s just 
focusing on what they tell you 
you need to focus on.”

From a confidence standpoint, 

the progression was also slow. 
After his first time on the big 
stage was a struggle, it took time 
for him to work his way back up. 
He knew he had to come back and 
keep making plays.

Then he had to do the same as 

competition raged on with the 
new coaching staff. That’s when 
he made his move to the top of the 
depth chart.

“I think with the coaches, 

they’ve (given) great effort and 
take the game more seriously,” 
Stribling said. “Not that the last 
coaches didn’t take it seriously, 
but it’s more of an NFL style. Like, 
if you make the play, you make 
the money. As long as you do your 
job and make sure you give great 
effort, make sure everything 
that you put into football is 100 
percent, it’ll come out great.”

At a stronger 6-foot-2 and 178 

pounds, the jump-balls Stribling 
once lost to Penn State should 
now be a strength. If he falls 
behind, he has the length to make 
it up. But he also can get caught 
sliding his feet, and then he has to 
move quickly to catch up.

Physically, 
Stribling 
has 

established himself. Mentally, he 
now believes in himself. To the 
coaches, he has proven himself.

All 
contributed 
to 
him 

becoming a starter this year, even 
if it took a nightmare in Happy 
Valley to start the process.

‘M’ finishes 12th in Cougar Classic

By NATHANIEL CLARK 

Daily Sports Writer

Legendary entertainer Bob 

Hope once said, “If you watch a 
game, it’s fun. If you play it, it’s 
recreation. If you work at it, it’s 
golf.”

The Michigan women’s golf 

team 
opened 
the 
2015-2016 

season by working its way to a 
12th-place finish out of 20 teams 
at the three-
day Powerade 
Cougar Classic 
in 
Hanahan, 

South 
Carolina. The 
Wolverines 
missed the top-
10 by just three 
strokes and the 
top-seven 
by 

five.

“We had a 

pretty tremendous opportunity 
playing 
some 
of 
the 
top 

teams in the country,” said 
Michigan coach Jan Dowling. 
“Unfortunately, we didn’t finish 

the way we wanted to. But 
(the tournament) gave us the 
confidence that we’re on the 
verge of being in the mix of the 
top teams in the country and 
that’s exciting.”

Junior 
Grace 
Choi 
led 

Michigan by finishing 15th with 
a total score of 219. Her best 
round came Monday with a score 
of 72 — exactly par. She birdied 
four times during the round, 

including 
three times on 
the back nine 
holes.

Choi 
has 

now finished 
in the top-20 
seven times in 
her collegiate 
career.

“It was a 

solid 
finish 

for 
(Grace),” 

Dowling said. “She’s a grinder, 
and that shows a lot of character.”

Sophomore Megan Kim was 

the 
Wolverines’ 
runner-up 

scorer, placing 40th with 225 

strokes. Her strongest round 
came on Sunday, when she shot 
73 and earned birdies on the 
seventh, 10th, 13th and 18th 
holes.

Michigan’s 
lone 
senior, 

Catherine Peters, battled back 
to finish 50th overall after a 
78-stroke round on Sunday left 
her in 78th place.

Freshman 
Elodie 
Van 

Dievoet, one of two freshmen 
on the Wolverines’ roster, made 
her collegiate debut at the 
Cougar Classic. She came out 
of the gate by shooting 73 with 
two birdies and found herself in 
a tie for 24th with Choi and Kim 
after Sunday.

“I think the course gave (Van 

Dievoet) a great taste of what 
American collegiate golf is all 
about,” Dowling said. “She’s got 
plenty of talent and had plenty of 
birdie opportunities.”

Van Dievoet, however, was 

unable to replicate Sunday’s 
performance 
and 
ultimately 

placed 77th with 232 strokes.

Rounding 
out 
Michigan’s 

scoring was sophomore Emily 
White, who finished 97th and 
scored 239. White reduced her 
stroke count in each successive 
round and finished her final 
round Tuesday with birdies on 
the ninth and 11th holes, scoring 
78.

The Wolverines will have 

two more tournaments before 
the fall is over. While Dowling 
said that the Cougar Classic will 
likely be the Michigan’s most 
difficult tournament, she still 
believes the experience will pay 
off.

“Next week at Wisconsin 

will be a wonderful opportunity 
for our team to come together,” 
Dowling said. “We’re playing a 
really fun format.”

“She’s a grinder, 

and that 

shows a lot of 

character.”

Hoop dreams 
pushed aside

Taco Charlton and 
Drake Harris still 
love the game of 

basketball

By ZACH SHAW 

Daily Sports Editor

With 
at 
least 
three 

scholarships available for next 
season, the Michigan men’s 
basketball coaches are scouring 
the nation in search of top 
basketball recruits.

If the chips fell into place, 

however, 
the 
Wolverines’ 

next star might already be on 
campus. Then again, they might 
be busy.

Sophomore receiver Drake 

Harris and junior defensive end 
Taco Charlton — both standout 
basketball players in high school 
— discussed the possibility of 
rekindling 
the hardwood 
flame 
Tuesday 
after football 
practice.

“We’ve 

joked around 
about 
it 

(with 
the 

coaches), nothing too serious,” 
Charlton said. “I love the game 
of basketball. It’s something 
I’ve played since I was a little 
kid, but nothing too serious 
anymore.”

Charlton, who has been close 

with senior guard Caris Levert 
since 
before 
kindergarten, 

helped 
recruit 
Levert 
to 

Michigan and even teamed up 
with the potential 2016 NBA 
draft pick in beating a team 
featuring 
senior 
defensive 

end Chris Wormley to win the 
Ohio state title in basketball. 
Charlton’s ties with Michigan 
basketball are still strong today.

“We’ll have some discussion 

about it maybe down the road,” 
Charlton said with a grin. 
“We have friendly talks, but 
it’s mostly just, ‘How are you 
doing?’ talking about Caris 

always.”

Harris, who averaged 24.2 

points per game at Grand 
Rapids Christian High School 
and was a Michigan State 
basketball 
recruit 
before 

switching to Michigan football, 
was less open to the concept 
after missing all of last season 
due to injury.

“There’s a lot of 6-foot-3 

guards out there in the country,” 
Harris said. “I just found a 
passion for football after my 
junior season, and from there I 
just wanted to play football and 
this is what I wanted to do.

“I didn’t get to play senior 

year of basketball because I 
enrolled early — it was a tough 
decision.”

Both Harris and Charlton 

continue 
to 
play 
pickup 

basketball in their spare time, 
and have close relationships 
with 
the 
basketball 
team. 

Beilein 
even 

joked 
about 

welcoming 
Charlton 
on 

the 
team 
on 

Michigan’s 
radio broadcast 
Saturday, 
noting 
that 

he 
saw 
the 

defensive end do a ‘360’ dunk 
in flip-flops when he recruited 
Levert.

“Coach Beilein, that’s my 

guy right there,” Charlton said. 
“I love those guys. Ever since 
they recruited Caris, I’ve been 
close with (the team). I helped 
Caris move in, we knew each 
other since preschool, so it’s a 
relationship we’ve always had.

“Growing 
up, 
we 
always 

wanted that dream, it used to be 
NBA dreams for both of us, now 
we have our different sports … 
I’m just happy he’s having the 
success he’s having.”

Harris and Charlton are 

happy with their decision to 
stay on the gridiron, and don’t 
plan on changing yet. But are 
they retired?

“I believe so,” Harris said 

with a smile.

Bunting’s father lives on in his memory

Tight end’s 

pregame song helps 

him remember

 his father

By MAX BULTMAN

Daily Sports Editor

Ian Bunting’s musical tastes 

are diverse, ranging from reggae 
to rap to classic rock. But when 
it comes to his pregame routine, 
his final song is a constant, just 
like the man it represents.

Before 
each 
game, 
the 

redshirt freshman tight end 
plays “Wild Horses” by the 

Rolling Stones. Its somber tones 
and 
slow-strummed 
guitar 

aren’t the typical hype-up music 
for a college football player, but 
that’s exactly the point. “Wild 
Horses” is the song that was 
playing when his father, Stephen 
Bunting, passed away.

Ian was 19 on February 18, 

2015, when his father died after 
a yearlong battle with brain 
cancer. Stephen was a far-too-
young 59.

“He was and still is my 

inspiration,” Bunting said.

The song goes:
“Faith has been broken, tears 

must be cried.

Let’s do some living after we 

die.

Wild Horses couldn’t drag me 

away.

Wild, wild horses, we’ll ride 

them some day.”

In this context, the lyrics to 

Wild Horses are both touching 
and 
heart-wrenching. 
To 

Bunting, though, they aren’t a 
source of pain.

“It’s just soothing,” Bunting 

said. “It calms me down, makes 
me think of my dad, which 
is awesome. That’s all I need 
before the game.”

It’s remarkable in its own 

right that Bunting is composed 
when opening up about the 
feelings associated with his 
father’s passing.

Bunting 
was 
emotional, 

of course, but he was also 
reflective. He has come to terms 
with the loss about as well as 
anyone possibly could in such a 
short span of time.

“It’s definitely been tough, 

but 
everyone 
goes 
through 

stuff, everyone’s got a story, 
everyone’s 
got 
(adversity),” 

Bunting said. “(Mark) Naylor, 
one of our strength coaches, he 
helped me a lot through that. 
He told me, ‘Everyone’s got 
(adversity), you can either make 
it your excuse or you can make 
it your story. I try to make it my 
story and not an excuse.’ ”

At the time of his father’s 

passing, Bunting was already 
dealing 
with 
all 
kinds 
of 

change on the football team. 
Jim Harbaugh had just been 
brought in as coach, and he 
had to balance staying afloat 
personally while also juggling a 
coaching transition and school.

But rather than sinking under 

the pressure and uncertainty, 
Bunting learned to use the 
football 
team 
for 
recovery 

instead of letting it become 
another source of stress.

“It was a lot. At times it was — 

sometimes you’ve just to put the 
blinders on,” Bunting said. “You 
go out to practice and that’s time 
you can forget about everything. 

It’s like an outlet. You can just 
go take out whatever anger you 
have and just 
forget 
about 

things for a 
while.

“Hardest 

thing 
that’s 

ever happened 
to 
me 
in 

life. But I’ve 
learned 
from 

it. 
And 
I’m 

stronger 
because of it.”

Stephen Bunting played high 

school football, but it was in 
Bunting’s other sports that his 
father coached him growing up. 
Bunting was much younger at 
the time, so doesn’t remember 
everything, but he does recall 

playing for his dad on his 
childhood 
basketball, 
soccer 

and 
baseball 

teams.

The 

parent-coach 
relationship 
can 
be 
a 

difficult 
one 

to 
navigate, 

but as Bunting 
remembers it, 
his 
dad 
had 

a 
knack 
for 

balancing the 

two.

“He knew how to work me 

hard and not be overly critical,” 
Bunting recalled. “But he was 
definitely critical, and gave me 
pointers and let me know when 
I needed to do better.”

Now, 
those 
memories, 

however faint, are part of what 
Bunting has to remember his 
father by.

There 
was 
an 
especially 

poignant 
moment 
before 

Michigan’s 
season 
opener 

against Utah. Stephen’s brother 
had played for the Utes, creating 
a fitting way for Bunting to play 
his first game after losing his 
dad. He played “Wild Horses,” 
and in his first-ever college 
game, Bunting had a 12-yard 
reception.

Stephen was able to see the 

Wolverines play a few times 
when he was sick, but his son 
was redshirting. He never got to 
see Ian play college football.

“He’s got the best seat in the 

house now,” Bunting said.

Consistency key for Michigan

By KEVIN SANTO 

Daily Sports Writer

For the past few years, the 

Michigan men’s soccer team has 
been plagued by inconsistency.

Consider the 2013 campaign, 

when 
the 

Wolverines 
tied 
teams 

like 
Bowling 

Green 
and 

Oakland, 
yet 

defeated No. 12 
Creighton.

Or just last 

year, 
when 

Michigan 
earned 
wins 

against No. 6 
Notre 
Dame 

and 
No. 
12 

Michigan 
State but suffered losses against 
Bowling Green and Western 
Michigan.

Now, as the Wolverines (2-1-

1) prepare to face Detroit on 

Wednesday, a familiar task is 
looming over them: defeating 
a respectable team in the wake 
of 
impressive 
performances 

against national powerhouses.

But 
for 
fifth-year 
senior 

forward Colin McAtee, the 2-1 
overtime victory against Niagara 
on Sept. 6 convinced him this 
team is different from those of 
his past.

“Last year, we struggled in 

these 
games,” 
McAtee 
said. 

“(But against Niagara) we were 
relentless — we kept going and 
we didn’t disrespect them. We 
found a way to win. That was a 
big turning point, because that 
gives us the confidence that we 
can go into those games with 
the same mentality, and I don’t 
expect anything different this 
Wednesday against Detroit.”

The Titans (2-2-2) graduated 

just four players in 2014 after 
battling Michigan to a 0-0 tie 
in their matchup at U-M Soccer 
Stadium last year.

Defensively, the Wolverines 

will be forced to handle Detroit’s 
balanced attack, led by forward 
Tyler Moorman and midfielder 
Spiro Pliakos.

Moorman and Pliakos lead the 

team with three goals and three 
assists, respectively, but there is 
plenty of firepower behind them 
as well. Aside from the duo, the 

Titans have seven players who 
have contributed either an assist 
or goal this season.

Though sophomore defender 

Billy Stevens is a game-time 
decision after suffering a face 
injury at Maryland, the back 
line should still be capable of 
containing 
Detroit’s 
threats. 

Michigan has allowed just three 
goals this season, and sophomore 
Evan Louro will continue to 
anchor the Wolverines in net. 
The goalkeeper boasts a .718 save 
percentage and two clean sheets.

If necessary, Stevens would 

likely be replaced with freshman 
Marcello Borges.

On the opposite end of the 

pitch, Michigan is averaging 
more than one goal per game, led 
by freshman Francis Atuahene. 
After his hat trick against West 
Virginia, he leads the Big Ten 
in goals scored and is poised to 
wreak havoc against the Titans’ 
defense with his on-ball skill.

Though Atuahene has looked 

unstoppable 
when 
taking 

defenders one on one this year, 
Nathan Steinwascher — the 2014 
Horizon 
League 
Goalkeeper 

of the Year — will be waiting 
for him when he finds scoring 
opportunities.

Of 
the 
obstacles 
the 

Wolverines have to overcome, 
Michigan coach Chaka Daley 

feels 
the 
greatest 
is 
their 

mindset.

“If we want to be a consistent 

program nationally, (we can’t) 
take any days off in preparation 
or approach,” Daley said. “Detroit 
is a tough team to play against. 
They have a different style and 
they have the personality of 
grinders. We have to dictate the 
game more than them.”

Following their game against 

Detroit, the Wolverines will 
host Northwestern for their Big 
Ten home opener on Sunday, at 
which there will be a ceremony 
commemorating 
125 
years 

of Michigan athletics. As a 
comparatively young program 
of 16 years, the ceremony will 
have a unique meaning for the 
Wolverines.

“Only being 16 years old, you 

get to look at it and dream of 
what you could be in 20, 30, 40 
years when these guys come back 
and I’m a retired old man,” Daley 
said. “What you’re creating is 
that legacy. And certainly other 
sports have done that, with 
softball almost 40 years and 
football has 135 years.

“From that standpoint, it’s 

something you look at and try to 
emulate, and hope that you can 
bring that kind of prominence or 
recognition to your program one 
day.”

Wednesday, September 16, 2015 // The Statement

T

here is no drink called 
a 
“chai 
tea 
latte.” 

I’m sorry, but it just 

doesn’t exist in the same way 
that Hallmark Holidays don’t 
exist. A “chai tea latte” is the 
Grandfather’s Day of coffee 
shop drinks — neither of them 
is actually real and is made to 
sound more exotic or genuine 
to siphon more money out of 
you.

Every time someone in 

front of me at the Starbucks 
line — or the Panera line, or 
the Espresso Royale line for 
that matter — orders a “chai 
tea latte,” a little part of me 
dies. The name sounds quite a 
bit silly when you realize that, 
when translated from Hindi, it 
actually means “tea tea latte.”

You’re ordering a “tea tea 

latte” and it makes absolutely 
no sense.

My particular gripe with 

modern coffee retailers is 
interesting: I drink coffee 
like it’s water. And I’m not 
talking about some diluted, 
cinnamon-spiced 
mocha-

frapped nonsense. I mean 
dark-roasted, pitch-black cof-
fee. It doesn’t matter if it’s the 
crappy, generic office-brand or 

imported, hand-roasted Bra-
zilian beans from the depths of 
the Amazon. If it tastes bitter 
and keeps me up, I will drink it.

That sounds terrifyingly 

unhealthy and a little bit crazy, 
and I should definitely work on 
weaning myself off of caffeine, 
I know.

Based on what you know 

about my coffee addiction, I 
really shouldn’t care too much 
about what a “chai tea latte” 
is or why it’s popular or why 
it has become such a staple on 
coffee shop menus in the past 
few years.

But here’s the thing: I 

inherited the caffeine addic-
tion from my dad, because the 
first thing he drinks before 
he leaves for work is the chai 
my mom makes for him every 
morning. He’ll always bee-
line to pull out his mug and 
takes out a sieve that perfectly 
fits his mug from the cabinet 
beneath the stove, to filter out 
the leaves when he pours his 
tea into the cup. 

My dad can’t get through 

his day without drinking chai. 
When we went to India about 
five or six years ago as a fam-
ily, the first thing he bought 

to bring back with him was 
a Costco-sized container of 
Wagh Bakri, a very strong 
brand of chai.

He kept sniffing the lid 

and saying, “Smell the chai, 
Tanya.” It was weird, yes, but 
I’ve grown up seeing that every 
morning while getting ready 
to go to elementary school, 
middle school and high school. 
Just as my dad watched his 
own father do the same thing 
his whole life, and my grandfa-
ther watched his father before 
him, and so on.

Chai is deeply ingrained in 

Indian social culture.

The 
tagline 
for 
Wagh 

Bakri is roughly translated to 
“warmth of relationships.” It’s 
plastered on all of their bill-
boards and a recurring theme 
in their television commer-
cials. The first thing my grand-
mother, aunts, and uncles 
in India offer guests to their 
homes is not coffee, or water. 
It’s chai.

Author 
Divya 
Prakash 

Dubey, in another rough trans-
lation from Hindi, writes in, 
Masala Chai, his short story 
collection, “chai is basically 
like another form of social 
networking.” It builds con-
nections and relationships; it 
acts as a source of comfort and 
warmth.

Chai is rooted in Indian cul-

ture in the same way coffee is 
distinctly an American habit. 
That’s why I can’t help but get 
annoyed when coffee shops 
advertise chai with a com-
pletely inaccurate term in an 
attempt to sound exotic.

Chai should remain a menu 

item in coffee shops. But it 
shouldn’t be referred to as a 
“chai tea latte.” I admit that in 
the larger scheme of cultural 
appropriation crimes com-
mitted by the western world, a 
“chai tea latte” is hardly press-
ing. But it’s still important.

I was bitten by a squirrel

I 

have met the devil. He 
has a bushy tail. Let me 
explain.

On a dry February morning 

freshman year, my friends and I 
met by the Cube to travel to Penn-
sylvania or Indiana or somewhere 
like Indiana and Pennsylvania. 
Iowa?

I stood with Karibou (his real 

name is Adam — no explana-
tion necessary). We were talking 
about something light — lamps or 
feathers, can’t remember which 
— when something distracted 
us: a squirrel, the size of a micro-
wave, scuttling beneath a bare-
branched tree. I held out my hand 
and performed my self-taught 
squirrel call: 

Tk-Tk-Tk-Tk-Tk.
He advanced. Cautiously, at 

first, then closer and closer, until 
his wet, disease-infested nose 
grazed my middle finger. Then, 
because I didn’t have food, he 
scurried away. It hurt like hell.

“Damn,” I thought and said. 

Where would I get food? Iowa?

I turned. Karibou was eat-

ing cookie crumbs out of pink 
Tupperware. A sign, I decided, 
if not from God then from the 
squirrels.

“Hey man,” I said, all coy. 

“Could I have some of those cook-
ie crumbs?”

Karibou paused, thought and 

said, “Only if you use them to feed 
the squirrel!”

Me: “You know I will!”
Karibou: “Hellz yeah.”
And so it was.
I placed the cookie crumbs 

on the ends of my fingers and 
approached the squirrel. He was 
staring at me with what I’d later 
recognize 
as 
I-can’t-tell-the-

difference-between-crumbs-
and-fingers eyes. At the time, I 
thought it was the hey-friend-
wanna-hear-a-forest-song 
look. 

Mistakes were made.

Tk-Tk-Tk-Tk-Tk.
A few steps closer.
Tk-Tk-Tk-Tk-Tk.

He scuttled up to me.
Tk-Tk-Tk-Tk-Tk.
There was animal in his eyes, 

but also brotherhood. Or was that 
a fruit fly?

Tk...Tk – Crunch.
Pain. 
Shock. 
Confusion. 

Incomprehension. Synonyms.

He bit my middle and index 

fingers, dug his teeth deep into 
my skin. Sharp, unnatural pain 
coursed through me — also, 
betrayal. 

“AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-

HHHHH,” I said.

The squirrel said nothing. His 

mouth was full.

I tried to pry him loose, but his 

teeth were latched into my fingers 
like hooks in fish lips. I tugged and 
grunted and tugged and moaned, 
but no give. My hand was too deli-
cious.

I panicked. What to do! Lose 

my fingers? Don’t be dramatic. 
Scream louder? On it. Call my 
parents once a week? Irrelevant.

Then, ol’ Alex thought of some-

thing he hadn’t before:

Say, I’m stronger than a squir-

rel.

With a mighty yank, I pulled 

my arm. My hand followed. Eyes 
closed, teeth clenched, I threw 
my fingers back and up like a jazz 
dancer (is that a thing?). The 
squirrel’s bite loosened, and I was 
free!

But don’t cheer yet, friend. 

Seriously, sit down, Clare. The 
worst was still to come.

Over my head, a fat brown 

shape the size of a stunted tod-
dler sailed twenty feet through 
the air and landed – thud – by the 
Cube. I’d chucked him. My God, 
I chucked a squirrel! Balls. He 
gathered his wits, gave me a rep-
rehensive look and left. A Bite and 
Run.

I cradled my blood-soaked fin-

gers and said things like, “How!” 
and “Why!” and “Hellz no!”

Then, I composed myself, 

washed my cuts and called Uni-
versity Health Services. “Squir-

rels don’t have rabies, hun.” Phew. 
All I needed was a tetanus shot 
within the past seven years, which 
I had. (High-fives self in face!) No 
tetanus here. (Just deep, incur-
able emotional scars.)

Before I could hang up, find 

a Star Wars band aide and call 
my therapist (Mom), the nurse 
offered some advice.

She: “You’re not supposed to 

feed the squirrels.”

Me: “Well, now I know, but it 

was fat so... ”

She: “You’re especially not sup-

posed to feed the fat squirrels.”

Me: “Well, madam, I assumed 

that because it was fat, it’d been 
fed many times. (I cough. My voice 
gets higher.) I assumed it was 
tamed. I figured it might be jolly!”

She: “Ah-heh-heh. No ... heh.”
That was three years ago. I’m 

older now, taller. I drink whisky 
(1/8 whisky, 7/8 coke). I think 
about more things, but for shorter 
time and with less depth. I’m an 
adult. And I’m afraid of a small 
woodland creature. Because he’s 
still out there. Waiting.

If you see him, call me. He’ll be 

the one stubbing out a cigarette, 
slipping on a pair of sunglasses 
and popping the collar of his 
“Hell’s Squirrels” black leather 
jacket.

His name is Nuts the Ripper, 

and he is dangerous.sure a mir-
acle, in the form of a sex tape, is 
in his imminent future. Maybe 
that’s why Selena’s doing all that 
yoga?

THE statement

Wednesday, September 16, 2015 // The Statement 
5B

W

hen Jack arrived and met his 
roommate his freshman year, 
things were going great.

The two, living in Northwood III on 

North Campus together, weren’t 

best friends, necessarily, but 

spoke regularly, played 

video games, and 

occasionally 

hung out. 

Then, upon returning from spring break, their friendly rela-
tionship changed suddenly.

“He refuses to respond to me and talk to me, and I have no 

idea why,” Jack recalled of the sudden shut out.

And that’s when Jack started noticing peculiar behaviors: 

His roommate would be drunk on weekdays, lock Jack out of 
the room — leaving Jack without a change of clothes for three 
to four days.

Jack’s whirlwind of a story isn’t a peculiar one. It’s some-

thing college roommates see increasingly across the country.

At an orientation session over the summer, incoming stu-

dents and their parents were asked a simple question: “By a 

show of hands, how many of you shared a room growing 

up?”

The vast majority of the parents in the room 

raised their hands. Most of the incoming 

class of 2015 kept their hands down.

This generational gap is due in 

part to the modern cultural 

trend toward smaller 

families, a New 

York Times 

article 

reported. Room-sharing inexperience, along with other cur-
rent societal factors, may be to blame for the rapid rise in 
roommate conflict on college campuses nationwide, according 
to the piece.

Additionally, texting and social media, cornerstones of the 

Millennial generation, both provide outlets for roommates to 
hide from direct confrontation behind the comfort of their cell 
phone screens.

However, Pamela Davis-Kean, a University professor spe-

cializing in developmental psychology, said there is no empiri-
cal evidence to support that social media and texting have 
directly increased roommate conflict. She added that a lack of 
communication is an issue affecting people of all ages.

“I don’t think college students are any better or any worse 

than people are at trying to figure out: how do you tell someone 
that they’re really annoying you?” Davis-Kean said. “There’s 
always been roommate conflict.”

She does, however, believe that texting and the convenience 

of communication have led to the “prolonged parenthood.” In 
the age of constant communication, parents are more connect-
ed to their children, and therefore more likely to continue par-
enting their child well beyond his or her twentieth birthday.

This extension of adolescence is a potential indication of 

college students’ increased dependence on their parents to 
solve their conflicts, especially their roommates.

Carrie Landrum, program manager at the Office of 

Student Conflict Resolution, said many cases of 

roommate conflict — in fact, the majority of 

cases OSCR sees — stem from a lack of 

direct communication.

“The anonymity that often 

comes with using some 

social 
media 
plat-

forms contrib-

utes 
to 

peo-

ple saying things in a different way than they might if they saw 
them in person,” Landrum said.

Landrum said this phenomenon is rooted in neuroscience. Mir-

ror neurons in the brain are activated when we act and when we 
observe others performing those same actions, allowing humans 
to identify and recognize basic universal facial expressions, such 
as happiness, hurt and sadness.

But when electronic communication preclude face-to-face 

interaction, roommates can struggle to understand each other’s 
emotional responses.

“We can exacerbate conflict rather than make it better,” Lan-

drum said.

Roommate relationships also suffer when students avoid com-

munication altogether. Landrum said silent expectations, stan-
dards to which roommates hold each othver but don’t express 
openly, can set students up for failure.

For Kaitlyn, a nursing sophomore who lived in Oxford dorms 

last year, a lack of communication defined her negative housing 
experience. After choosing to room blind — an option Housing 
reports 62 percent of incoming freshman choose — Kaitlyn found 
her roommate to be shy and unfriendly.

“We were civil to each other and it was fine — no big deal,” Kai-

tlyn recalled.

However, things turned ugly when Kaitlyn asked her room-

mate to let Kaitlyn’s boyfriend, who goes to another school, stay 
in their room overnight. Kaitlyn recalls her roommate refused to 
discuss the issue.

“Because she refused to talk to me straight up in the beginning, 

from then on the only times we did talk it was very hostile,” Kait-
lyn said. “I kind of avoided her. We slept in the same room, but we 
didn’t talk, and then when I tried to reassess the situation and talk 
to her, it was just a hostile experience.”

Kaitlyn’s roommate switched dorms shortly after Fall Break 

and cut ties on social media.

According to Amir Baghdadchi, University Housing spokesper-

son, roommates’ unwillingness to even address uncomfortable 
issues is a common occurrence.

“In housing, when we see a conflict arise, the first thing we’re 

trying to do is understand ‘OK, have these roommates even talked 
about it,” Baghdadchi said.

Many times Housing officials find the answer is no.
University Housing requires all students sharing a room in a 

residence hall to fill out a “roommate contract” within the first 
week of school. Students fill out items such as what they feel com-
fortable with their roommate borrowing, how they feel about 
overnight guests, and any cultural identities or customs they want 
their roommates to respect. 

Baghdadchi said the roommate contract works as a preventa-

tive measure, forcing students to have the uncomfortable conver-
sations they might otherwise avoid.

“If you think about it, when you have two or more people who 

have never lived with someone before — certainly they haven’t 
lived with someone who they just met or is outside their family — 
neither of them wants to be the kind of roommate that brings up 
uncomfortable stuff,” Baghdadchi said.

Though these contracts may initiate communication between 

roommates, further conflicts naturally arise. In these situations, 
University Housing recommends students seek help from the 
Office of Student Conflict Resolution, which offers resources such 
as one-on-one conflict coaching sessions and mediation services 

to students living both on and off campus.

At first, Jack, who experienced sudden conflict with his room-

mate freshman year, didn’t want to escalate the problem further.

“I didn’t want to get the University involved if I didn’t have to,” 

Jack said.

Finally, Jack e-mailed his residential adviser that he was no 

longer comfortable living in his room. In response, the University 
organized a peer mediation session between Jack and his room-
mate.

However, Jack says his roommate denied everything at the 

session, saying he was a heavy sleeper and that sometimes he 
couldn’t open their door because he couldn’t hear Jack knocking.

The mediator wrote his story off as a simple case of miscom-

munication, Jack says, and Housing services eventually refused 
to grant Jack a room change, saying that because there were only 
two months left of school, he should “do his best to work it out.”

Immediately after, Jack moved into a friend’s off-campus 

apartment for the remainder of the year.

Reflecting on the situation, Jack said the University failed him, 

and he wished the issues could have been resolved in a more effi-
cient manner.

****

On the topic of student health and academic success, Davis-

Kean, the professor of developmental psychology, said from her 
perspective a University should never say a student has to stay 
with his or her roommate.

“If it’s getting in the way of somebody being academically 

successful at U-M or it’s hurting your mental health or physical 
health, then those are things that we should be doing something 
about,” Davis-Kean said.

While the University has a room swap program that allows stu-

dents to post on the Housing website looking for others’ to trade 
rooms with, this system is dependent on other students’ requests 
and can be a time-sensitive process. This system also assumes 
that a student would be willing to live with the roommate another 
student is actively trying to avoid.

Despite the national rise in roommate conflict outlined in the 

New York Times article, the University Housing maintains that it 
has not seen a rise in roommate conflict.

Though many colleges and universities require students to take 

questionnaires, asking them basic questions like what time they 
generally go to sleep, their partying habits, among others, the Uni-
versity’s roommate matching process is currently random.

For the time being, it appears the system is here to stay.
“We did a pilot a number of years ago with a questionnaire,” 

Housing spokesperson Baghdadchi said. “It turned out to be no 
more successful than rooming blind.”

Mallory Martin, associate director for Housing Student Con-

duct and Conflict Resolution, works with residents, residential 
staff, and hall directors across campus to address conflict resolu-
tion. 

In an e-mail to The Michigan Daily, Martin wrote because 

many roommate conflicts are inherently different in nature, each 
requires a different path to resolution. 

“Conflict can show up in different ways so there is not one 

approach or pathway for all resolutions. It starts with listening, 
and trying to understand what’s underneath the conflict: part of 
the issue could be a health condition or stress, for example so we 
want to make sure we’re really helping in the right way.”

Ice Bucket Challenge, one year later

by Irene Park, Daily Staff Reporter

I

t’s been a little over a year since the Ice Bucket challenge 
took the nation by storm. But, at the University and beyond, 
researchers are still feeling the tingle.

Following one of the nation’s largest charitable fundraising 

drives outside of a natural disaster or emergency, the ALS Asso-
ciation — the primary benefactor of the initial social-media move-
ment — is well on its way to distributing the $115 million raised 
since last summer. (By comparison, the charity brought in $5 mil-
lion during the same period in 2013, the year before the Ice Bucket 
Challenge went viral.)

Stephen Goutman, assistant professor of neurology and director 

of the University ALS Clinic, said the Challenge not only raised 
money to support ALS research, but it also raised awareness of the 
disease.

“The number of people search for ALS on websites such as 

Wikipedia skyrocketed,” Goutman said. “Prior to this challenge, 
many individuals were not familiar with (ALS) and the devastating 
symptoms associated with it.”

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig’s Dis-

ease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that kills nerve 
cells in the brain and the spinal cord. When the disease kills 
motor neurons, which connect the brain, spinal cord, and muscles 
throughout the body, the brain can no longer control muscle move-
ments.

ALS patients in the later stages of the disease become complete-

ly paralyzed and experience severe muscle wasting. The inability 
to control muscles can lead to difficulty swallowing, walking, and 
breathing. Currently, there is no cure for ALS.

“It is really important to increase the recognition for this disease 

not only to help strengthen advocacy efforts aimed at improving 
care for patients, but also to help raise money to fund the much-
needed research efforts to find better treatments and cures for this 
disease,” Goutman said.

The effects are being felt nationwide.
Researchers at Johns Hopkins University credited the Ice Buck-

et Challenge in helping to raise funds for continued studies. Last 
month, Philip Wong, professor of pathology and neuroscience at 
Johns Hopkins, and his colleagues published a study in Science 
that demonstrated the role of clumps of proteins called TDP-43 in 
the brain cells of ALS patients.

“Without (the funding), we wouldn’t have been able to come out 

with the studies as quickly as we did,” Wong told The Washington 
Post.

The ALS Association has said $47 million of the $115 million 

raised has been spent or budgeted toward scientific purposes. The 
Association revealed its full plan on how the money raised from 
the Ice Bucket Challenge will eventually be spent: $77 million 
on research, $23 million on patient and community services, $10 
million on public and professional education, $3 million on fund-
raising, and $2 million on external processing fees. Since there is 
still no cure for ALS, the majority of raised money will be spent on 

research to find one.

The viral social media sensation has since credited to Pete 

Frates, a former Boston College baseball player who was diagnosed 
with ALS in 2012. Since his diagnosis, he was active in advocacy 
and fundraising for the disease. Frates and his friend, Pat Quinn, 
who was diagnosed with ALS in 2013, started the challenge — and 
named the ALS Association as the benefactor — after watching a 
similar ice-bucket video online. 

As of September 2014, there were more than 17 million videos 

related to the challenge posted on Facebook, which were viewed 
over 10 billion times by more than 440 million people, according 
to the Association. Numerous high-profile individuals participated 
in the challenge, including President Barack Obama (who did not 
actually do the challenge but made a donation instead), Bill Gates, 
Mark Zuckerberg, LeBron James, Oprah Winfrey, and Taylor 
Swift.

Even some University professors accepted the challenge, includ-

ing Eva Feldman, professor of neurology and director of research 
at the University’s ALS Clinic, who has performed research on a 
revolutionary stem cell therapy for the disease.

But, at the peak of its popularity, the movement was met with 

some criticisms.

Critics voiced their concern about how it was unsatisfactory 

in meeting its goal of raising awareness about the disease. Jacob 
Davidson at Time magazine called the challenge “problematic in 
almost every way,” mainly criticizing how the challenge did little 
to explain what ALS actually is.

Davidson noted that some people like Ethel Kennedy, widow 

of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and Matthew Lauer, host of NBC’s 
“The Today Show”, participated in the challenge without even 
mentioning the disease. In spite of its flaws, Davidson also noted 
that the challenge has done “a lot of good” but should be improved.

Paul Marantz, associate dean and professor at the Albert Ein-

stein School of Medicine, argued on his blog, “The Doctor’s Tablet,” 
that it is dangerous for the public to think the Ice Bucket Challenge 
was the reason for a scientific breakthrough in ALS research for 
several reasons.

“Let us not mislead the public about the significance of indi-

vidual, incremental steps in the arc of science, nor promulgate the 
notion that ‘crowdsourcing’ scientific discovery will get us where 
we need to go,” Marantz wrote.

Regardless, the ALS Association hopes to continue the success 

of last year’s Ice Bucket Challenge. The charity reintroduced the 
challenge last month with a hashtag #EveryAugustUntilACure, 
adopting the challenge as a yearly initiative.

Barbara Newhouse, president and CEO of The ALS Association, 

said in her statement the initiative would continue every year until 
there is a cure for ALS.

“Progress is being made when it comes to finding treatments and 

a cure for (ALS), and we’re so grateful for the support this August 
and every August until there’s a cure,” Newhouse said.

Personal Statement: Growing up in haunted houses

by Hailey Middlebrook, Daily Arts Writer

T

he haunted houses began with cardboard 
boxes.

It was two weeks before my seventh 

birthday, when my family still lived in our Lin-
coln Log home in Colorado. My dad brought 
back a dozen shipping boxes, the long and skinny 
kind that hold coat racks, just wide enough for 
my friends and I to crawl through, tunnel-style. 
I frowned as he disappeared into the basement, 
ribbed cardboard knocking down the jack o’ lan-
terns I’d just set up. It was late October, a few 
blustery nights before trick-or-treating; just close 
enough to November fourth to throw my first Hal-
loween-themed birthday party.

My dad, a ghost story master and scary movie 

fanatic, was hooked on Halloween. Maybe it was 
because he’d met my mom at a Halloween party 
when he was in law school and she in medical 
school; she’d dressed as a baby and he was a boxer, 
a “total knockout,” he would joke. Or maybe it was 
the way mine and my younger sister’s eyes would 
widen around the campfire as he told us about 
the howling ghost dogs in the woods — when he’d 
pause, our hearts thudding — and our mom would 
sweep in on cue, tying up the story with a happy 
bow. We’d snuggle in the tent, all warm bodies and 
crickets, sleeping soundly with dreams of friendly 
ghosts.

When I started planning my birthday party, 

little organized queen that I was, I was strict with 
my theme: spooky spiders, not friendly ghosts. As 
a wizened first grader, I’d seen my fair share of 
scary things. I’d ridden the Haunted Mansion ride 
at Disney World. The scarier the haunted house, 
I decided, the more fun the party was. And so it 
began.

****

Eleven years later, orange lights bobbed in the 

mist as we made our way to the castle-house on the 
hill. My heels clicked on the concrete, calf-high 
leather, the closest thing to cowboy boots I could 

find in my dorm room trunk. I’d linked arms with 
my friend, another freshman in West Quad, our 
matching tied-up flannels and cutoffs brushing 
with each step. Cute cowgirl: instant Halloween 
party costume. 

The castle was packed. A thick fog of smoke 

and body heat made faces hazy, their movements 
blurred and jaunty, like the final room of our 
haunted house: Zombie hiding in corner, strobe 
lights, FOG MACHINE! Except these zombies 
were different — all lumberjacks and bunnies and 
cats, laughing too loudly and staggering to the 
beat of Rihanna. Alive. Friendly ghosts, as long as 
you didn’t get too close. The “no touching” policy 
didn’t apply to this haunted house.

****

When I outgrew the cardboard boxes, around 

middle school, our garage became the new haunt-
ed house. The construction would begin in early 
October: bendy boards of plywood, stapled togeth-
er in a narrow maze, covered in black sheets of 
plastic.

The scent of plastic stayed with me, even after 

we packed away decorations. Even after the season 
changed, the years passed, my new home became 
a dorm room. My college roommate baked banana 
bread because it smelled like home; I lingered 
unknowingly by hardware shops. The chemical 
smell always stopped me, slinging me back to fall, 
to my family, to our haunted house kingdom. 

Designing the house was my favorite part. The 

plan was simple: I’d bring my friends to the side 
door of the garage (where I’d pause, to heighten 
anticipation), then enter the main room, occu-
pied by a haggard skeleton in a rocking chair and 
a phony chandelier, creepy music overhead. We’d 
twist through the dark plastic walls, shrieking 
from my dad and brother jumping out of corners, 
their faces hidden by masks. The last room was 
thick with smoke and strobe lights; and my broth-
er, suddenly lunging from the fog.

Screaming, scrambling, we’d bolt through the 

front door into my mom’s candlelit living room, 
surrendering to the smells of freshly baked carrot 
cake and caramel apples. Sugar smeared on our 
fingers, we’d tell each other ghost stories, giggling 
to prove we were brave. 

****

Our laughter pierced the quiet in Jess’s apart-

ment, its shrillness wafting up and out of the balco-
ny doors. It was our last night together as summer 
interns; but really we were celebrating Jess, who’d 
already graduated and landed a full-time job as 
the magazine’s art editor. While three of us were 
heading back to college for our senior years, Jess 
would stay here, alone in her brand-new life.

The furniture wouldn’t be here for a week, when 

her parents could drive it up. Empty, the room was 
massive, smelling of plastic sheets. Cardboard 
boxes towered in the corner like hulking monsters, 
casting shadows over our huddled circle on the 
floor. We sipped wine from Dixie cups and talked 
about the future.

“Are you scared?” I asked Jess, the question 

burning the tip of my tongue.

“All the time,” she said after a minute; the room 

hushed. Fingers clenched around Dixie cups. 
“Right now, I have a job, an apartment, a boy-
friend. But a year from now, that could all change. 
Don’t know what’s around the corner, ya know?”

I watched the red wine swirl in my cup, like the 

fake blood I used to paint on my brother’s face. The 
floor creaked in the silence, eerie and empty. But 
Jess’s apartment wasn’t so much haunted as it was 
waiting, testing her. Weeding out the screamers, 
leaving the brave alone. I realized then that the 
real haunted houses in life can’t be designed, their 
twists mapped out and surprise scares planned. 
They don’t always stick to the theme, your vision, 
no matter how organized you are.

I don’t build haunted houses anymore. But I’m 

learning to feel my way through the dark.

For over thirty years, ArtScape, the largest free arts festival in the U.S., has taken place over a three-day period in mid July, centered in downtown Baltimore between Penn 

Station and the Meyerhoff Symphony Hall. Most vendors and performance stages are located on either Charles St. or Mt. Royal Ave. The event annually draws more than 400,000 
attendees, despite very hot and humid weather. Both local and national artists are drawn to the festival resulting in a diverse display of art and performance. Highlights include the main 
performance stage by the Maryland Institute College of Art and an extensive menu of international food served around the festival.

Four roller-skaters talk amongst themselves while preparing to dance on skates at ArtScape in Balti-
more. 

Each year the main stage at ArtScape draws large crowds that come to listen to the free music, even if many have never heard of each group before. In 2015 the headline act was Michael Franti & Spearhead 
on Saturday. Here, the audience lines the hill of the old Mt. Royal Train Station where the main stage is located to see the final performances on a Sunday night in July. 

LEFT: Though there are many scheduled performances by artists on multiple stages over multiple days, many local musicians simply play amongst the crowd on the sidewalk for tips. This saxophonist played 
for those taking a break to eat by a group of food trucks on the final day of ArtScape. RIGHT: Always held in mid-July, ArtScape is plagued by high-temperatures that are compounded by Baltimore’s consis-
tently high humidity. Multiple cooling stations offered at the event combat highs that in past years have reached triple digits.

Members of the Capoeira Angola Baltimore chapter perform near University of Baltimore on Mt. Royal 
Ave. at ArtScape on the festival’s last day.
