LSA senior Dylan Gilbert was 
sitting in a class discussion with 
the other 20-or-so members 
of her class, when her English 
professor Scott Lyons read out 
loud the N-word from a short 
story by American writer William 
Faulkner. Gilbert, uncomfortable 
with the situation, left the 
discussion that day.
Though the class carried on, 
the professor’s choice to read 
the racial slur and the student’s 
protest 
ultimately 
raised 
an 
ongoing 
academic 
debate: 
whether or not the use of racial 
slurs from academic text is 
appropriate in the classroom. 
In June 2020, around a year 
later, Gilbert told her story on 
Twitter, where she received 
an outpouring of support from 
fellow University of Michigan 
students, alumni, faculty and 
staff, many condemning the 
professor and the University for 
tolerating the behavior. 
“I was just kind of exhausted,” 
Gilbert told The Daily. “I don’t feel 
like I should have to sit in a room 
and have a non-Black person 
keep saying the N-word in front 
of me. So I just quietly packed 
up my stuff 

into my bag, walked out of class 
and did not say anything.”
Details 
of 
the 
incident 
surfaced 
amid 
a 
renewed 
national commitment against 
systemic 
racism, 
thereby 
calling into question the impact 
classrooms have on perpetuating 
racial injustice. 
“The 
environment 
wasn’t 
comfortable anymore,” Gilbert 
said. “I felt targeted in the 
environment, and I felt unsafe 
in the environment, and I didn’t 
feel like I was learning the way 
I needed to learn. So when you 
use racial slurs in the classroom, 
you’re taking away some sense 
of equality in the classroom 
because now a group of your 
students aren’t feeling the way 
they should be feeling to properly 
learn.”
Gilbert’s tweets also included 
screenshots of email exchanges 
between her and Lyons after the 
class, in which Lyons did not 
offer an apology but committed 
to “avoid uttering the word for 
the rest of the term.” For the 
next class period, according to 
Gilbert, Lyons assigned an article 
defending the use of the word.
“I’m not sure I understand the 
distinction between assigning a 
work with the n-word (written 
by a non-black writer and read 
by mostly non-black readers) and 

reading it out loud -- imagination 
versus exhaulation? -- but I do 
take your point,” Lyons wrote in 
the email exchanges.
The Daily reached out to Lyons 
multiple times for a comment, 
but was referred to University 
spokesman Rick Fitzgerald.
“Students have a variety of 
ways to raise concerns about 
their classroom experiences,” 
Fitzgerald wrote in an email to 
The Daily. “In this case, these 
concerns are being addressed 
through 
the 
appropriate 
channels.”
This 
incident 
does 
not 
appear to be an isolated one, 
either. 
Universities 
across 
the country have struggled to 
address how professors should 
approach teaching racial slurs. 
Some institutions have taken 
to suspending professors for 
using racial slurs in an academic 
environment, while others have 
defended their use based on 
academic freedom.
English 
professor 
Susan 
Parrish often teaches texts from 
Southern literature, which can 
include epithets against various 
groups. 
She 
explained 
how 
voicing these slurs can harm 
the ability for students to learn

‘U’ community debates whether the 
N-word has a place in the classroom

Design by Hibah Chughtai
Tuesday afternoon, the Department 
of 
Homeland 
Security 
and 
U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
agreed to repeal regulations that 
restrict international students from 
taking a full online course load while 
residing in the U.S.
The rescinded regulations were 
announced by federal Judge Allison 
Burroughs during a lawsuit in Boston 
brought by Harvard University and 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
according to the Associated Press.
The decision comes after the July 6 
federal guidelines that stated F-1 and 
M-1 visa students will not be allowed 
to enter or remain in the United States 
if all university classes were moved 
online. 
The 
announcement 
sparked 
an 
uproar of opposition from institutions 
across the country, including Harvard 
and MIT, who led the lawsuit against 
the federal government. The University 
of Michigan, along with several other 
universities and colleges, have since 
joined the lawsuit as a friend of the 
court. 
Rackham 
Student 
Government 
also filed an amicus brief in the 
Massachusetts District Court in the 
lawsuit against the ICE restrictions on 
Monday morning along with 15 other 
student government bodies.

government 
announced

This week, multiple women 
have spoken about Former Univer-
sity of Michigan Provost Martin 
A. Philbert’s alleged sexual mis-
conduct for the first time since the 
investigation began. University 
alum Emily Renda spoke to Mich-
igan Radio about her interactions 
with Philbert dating back to 2012. 
Renda, who worked as a global 
health and student life coordin-
ator at the School of Public Health 
where she was previously a stu-
dent, is one of the first of alumni to 
publicly accuse Philbert of sexual 
misconduct. 
Additionally, one of Philbert’s 
former lab employees alleged-
ly told Anthony Walesby, former 
senior Director of the Office of 
Institutional Equity and Title IX 
coordinator, that Philbert sexually 
harassed her. 
Philbert, also the executive vice 
president of academic affairs, was 
placed on administrative leave on 
Jan. 21 following a string of alleg-
ations of sexual misconduct. In 
addition, after being removed from 
his role as provost in March, Phil-
bert retired from his position at the 
University on June 17. 
University 
spokesman 
Rick 
Fitzgerald told The Daily in an 
email that the University con-
demns sexual misconduct and 
wants to promote a safe commun-
ity, but noted they are not able to 
comment on specific allegations 
due to the ongoing investigation. 
“At the University of Mich-
igan, we condemn all forms of 
sexual misconduct,” Fitzgerald 
wrote. “Whether it takes place 
now or took place in the past, it is 
unacceptable. All members of our 
community deserve to feel safe 
and supported. The university has 
taken extensive measures to com-
bat sexual misconduct...Because 
of the independent WilmerHale 
investigation, we are not able to 
offer a specific response to the 
allegations you outline in your 

email.”
In 2012, Renda said she was 
being stalked by her ex-boyfriend 
and Philbert began offering her 
rides home from the office, accord-
ing to Michigan Radio. The car 
rides turned into a six-month 
physical relationship with Phil-
bert, which ended in 2014, Renda 
alleged. After Philbert ended the 
relationship, 
however, 
Renda 
said he continued to make sexual 
advances.
“(One day) he came into my 
office and hugged me for a very 
long time, and then started to put 
his hands down my pants,” Renda 
said. “And I was like, ‘whoa, whoa, 
what are you doing? I thought you 
said that this was over. We’re not 
doing this anymore.’”
Renda decided to leave the Uni-
versity after changes with their 
professional relationship, includ-
ing reassigning a large project 
from Renda to another staffer. 
Renda said she started experien-
cing panic attacks as a result of this 
shift in Philbert’s behavior. 
“I left (the University) in com-
plete shame,” Renda said. “I felt 
like a complete professional and 
moral failure. I felt like I had 
engaged in an affair with a mar-
ried man, who was also my boss, 
and that I ruined my career and 
that that was my fault for making 
such a poor choice.”
Renda told The Daily in an email 
she decided to come forward with 
her allegations now because she 
feels it is important for the Univer-
sity community to know the details 
of Philbert’s alleged misconduct. 
“I feared that the University 
would decide to not provide any 
details about the kinds of pred-
atory behavior he was engaging 
in for over two decades,” Renda 
said. “The investigation has been 
ongoing for over six months 
without any substantive updates 
provided to the University com-
munity. The survivors and the 
broader University community 
deserve transparency from the 
University about what happened, 
how it was able to happen, and the 
steps they plan to take to ensure 
such gross abuses of power are not 
able to persist within the Univer-
sity’s ranks.”

Three women speak 
out against Philbert

The recent tuition increase passed 
by the Board of Regents as part of the 
fiscal year 2020-21 budget for the 
University of Michigan has thrust the 
University’s $12 billion endowment 
into the spotlight. Students, Regents 
and parents alike have pointed to 
the money as a possible way to avoid 
increasing tuition on families that are 
struggling as a result of the COVID-19 
pandemic.
Put simply, the endowment is 
the pool of the assets given to the 
University by its donors — but the 
way these funds are used is anything 
but simple. Endowments are better 
understood not as a piggy banks, 
but as an actual bank in terms of 
the limits on appropriations of its 
seemingly ample funds and the way it 
generates income.
As of October 2019, 11,700 different 
funds made up the University 
Endowment Fund, and each of 
these individual funds represents 
the money given to the University. 
Among the first funds added to 
the endowment were the proceeds 
from the sale of land ceded to the 
University in the Treaty of Fort Meigs 
by three Native American tribes. 
Over time, through contributions and 
investment revenues, the Endowment 
Fund has grown to $12.7 billion as of 
June 30, 2019. 
However, not all of those funds can 
be spent at will. In the 2019 fiscal year 
financial statements, the University 

listed $4.47 billion in restricted 
endowed funds, with $2.38 billion in 
“funds-functioning-as-endowment,” 
a designation which holds the initial 
investment inviolate (meaning it can’t 
be spent in any way). These restricted 
funds are further split into expendable 
and non-expendable funds. The latter 
references the initial investment 
for endowed funds and the former 
represents both FFE and the growth 
of permanent endowments.
Outside of the restricted funds, 
the 
endowment 
also 
includes 
unrestricted reserves. These are 
funds that can be spent at the Regents’ 
discretion. The Regents have elected 
to distribute 4.5 percent of the 
endowment each year. The University 
explains this decision in an FAQ from 
the Office of Public Affairs.
“The 4.5 percent distribution rate 
helps to insulate the endowment from 
anticipated market volatility that 
includes lower investment returns 
and higher inflation,” the FAQ says. 
“It also ensures continued, steady 
support of university operations 
during uncertain economic times 
- including funding for student 
scholarships, faculty salaries and 
academic programs. The distribution 
from the endowment has steadily 
increased each year since 2003.”
Most schools generally spend 
between 4 and 5 percent of their 
respective endowment every year, 
according to Connor Murnane, a 
spokesman for the American Council 
for Trustees and Alumni (ACTA). 
At the University, this strategy of 
spending a little and investing the rest 
has led to handsome returns. Since 
2010, the fund has doubled in size and 
since 2000, nearly $5 billion has been 
distributed from the endowment.

Alec Gallimore, University of 

Michigan dean of engineering, 
and Laura Blake Jones, dean of 
students, held a town hall with 
various student groups involved in 
plans for the upcoming school year 
on Monday afternoon following 
University President Mark Schlis-
sel’s announcement regarding fall 
semester earlier in the day.

After walking through informa-

tion presented in Schlissel’s email 
and the new website, Gallimore and 
Jones answered student inquiries 
in an event moderated by Public 
Policy senior Amanda Kaplan, Cen-
tral Student Government president.

The town hall was primar-

ily intended for the more than 600 
students involved in the COVID-
19 Campus Challenge, a student-
created competition to brainstorm 
solutions for various problems that 
may arise in the fall. Kaplan said 
students in the Campus Climate 
Advisory Council, a group of about 
40 students from various boards, 
organizations and student employ-
ee groups advising on fall planning, 
were also invited.

In an email to The Daily, Jones 

wrote the town hall was meant to 
highlight key elements of Schlis-
sel’s announcement as well as to 
continue seeking input from chal-
lenge participants.

“The 
Challenge 
participants 

are a large representative group of 
undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents from a wide variety of schools 
and colleges,” Jones wrote. “Their 
keen interest in the COVID Chal-
lenge and commitment to planning 
for a safe residential experience 
made them an ideal constituent 
group to talk with.”

According to Gallimore, the orig-

inal timeline planned for a decision 
about fall semester was to be made 
in July. The timeline was moved up 
one month, allowing for the deci-
sion to come at the end of June.

“What we will do actually is 

in some respects use June and 
July and August to do a number 

of things, to do some practice ses-
sions, dry runs et cetera, so that 
we’re ready for you when many of 
you come back in late August for a 
wonderful semester of mixed edu-
cational experiences,” Gallimore 
said. “We will use the fall term to 
evaluate how things worked and 
improve upon them for winter 
2021.”

Gallimore 
emphasized 
the 

hundreds of administrators, fac-
ulty, staff and students involved 
in planning efforts by pointing to 
the numerous committees work-
ing on issues ranging from testing 
to transportation to student mental 
health. Similar to the new Campus 
Maize & Blueprint website, Galli-
more said success of the school year 
would depend on “stacking” mea-
sures from physical distancing to 
administrative controls on density.

Generally, classes with over 50 

people will be conducted remotely, 
while classes with 10 to 15 or fewer 
students will be held in-person, 
subject to space availability, Gal-
limore explained. Classes in the 
in-between range may be offered 
in-person if physical distancing is 
possible in the learning space.

Jones focused on the need for 

students to be responsible, which 
both she and Gallimore expressed 
was one of their greatest worries 
about the upcoming semester. She 
shared a draft of a behavior pledge 
which 
includes 
current 
public 

health guidelines such as wearing 
masks, maintaining social distance 
and limiting social gatherings. 

To encourage individuals to fol-

low the pledge, Jones said there 
will be education efforts and social 
media campaigns to emphasize 
its importance. Jones said she 
hoped the University community 
would embrace a “culture of care” 
in which everyone acts according 
to the well-being of those around 
them — particularly those most 
vulnerable to the virus — and 
beyond their own desires of what 
they want to do.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com NEWS

The School of Music, Theatre 

& Dance released the results of 
a schoolwide climate survey on 
Thursday as part of the administra-
tion’s efforts to foster a transparent, 
inclusive environment. 

This survey was conducted after 

sexual misconduct allegations were 
reported against two high-profile 
SMTD faculty members, David 
Daniels and Stephen Shipps, in 
2018.

An investigation by The Daily 

from October 2018 revealed that 
SMTD awarded Daniels tenure in 
May 2018 despite knowledge of 
allegations of sexual misconduct 
against him. The Board of Regents 
has since fired Daniels after an 
eight-month process. Daniels cur-
rently faces a criminal charge of 
sexual assault in Texas along with 
his husband, Scott Walters. 

An investigation by The Daily 

from December 2018 uncovered 
40 years of previously undisclosed 
allegations of sexual harassment, 
misconduct and assault against 
Shipps, then-chair of strings and 
former associate dean. Shipps has 

since retired from the University. 

SMTD has publicly committed 

to fighting a culture some have 
described as particularly condu-
cive to sexual misconduct, as many 
arts disciplines require individual 
or physical lessons. The adminis-
tration has held events on how to 
report sexual misconduct and has 
installed transparent panels in 
offices. The survey is just one step 
in an ongoing, multidimensional 
process to enact change, according 
to SMTD Dean David Gier. 

“The 
emotional 
vulnerability 

that artists bring is a necessary part 
of the training and we need to make 
sure that our environment is a com-
fortable environment for this to 
take place,” Gier said.

According to the report, the 

survey was conducted by Giffen & 
Kaminski, LLC, a law firm hired 
by SMTD to help “learn what mem-
bers of the SMTD community have 
experienced and solicit positive and 
negative feedback” so that “issues 
did not fester in an atmosphere of 
secrets and darkness.” 

657 participants responded to 

the survey, which asked about both 
the overall climate and specifics 
around sexual misconduct, dis-
crimination and retaliation within 
SMTD. 
These 
657 
participants 

included students, faculty, staff and 
alumni. The survey was distributed 
in January of 2020 to a representa-
tive sample of SMTD with 37% of 
students, 64% of faculty, and 73% of 

staff responding, according to the 
report. 

The report noted that while 59 

percent of participants felt satis-
fied by the climate over the past 12 
months, women found SMTD to be 
less safe than men and faculty less 
safe than students, alumni and staff. 
Also, while 90 percent of the partic-
ipants reported no experience with 
discrimination, Latinx individuals 
and people who identify as queer 
were the most likely to report expe-
riences of discrimination.

In terms of sexual misconduct, 

the report documented 107 inci-
dents over the past 12 months. Sex-
ual comments made up 40 percent 
of this total.

The report specifically said “the 

role of the Faculty as accused per-
petrators of Sexual Misconduct is 
an overarching theme that should 
be noted.” 41 percent of the sexual 
comments and 43 percent of the 
incidents of forcible touching over 
the past 12 months were allegedly 
perpetrated by faculty.

The report found that only 27 

percent of participants who alleg-
edly experienced sexual miscon-
duct reported their experiences to 
authorities. In terms of discrimi-
nation, the report said “most Par-
ticipants would not involve the 
resources of the University or of 
SMTD.”

T

witter is no stranger to con-
troversy, so it comes as little 
surprise that J.K. Rowling, 
author of the Harry Potter series, has 
come under fire for some bad remarks 
regarding transgender people. But 
this time, there’s something far more 
important than another poor-taste 
“cancel culture” debate or reminding 
people that freedom of speech doesn’t 
mean freedom from social consequenc-
es. Unlike most bad tweets, Rowling’s 
can do tangible harm — and they already 
have — through the spread of dangerous 
misinformation and the exploitation of 
marginalized communities.
Rowling has explicitly categorized 
herself as “speak(ing) the truth” in 
these tweets, despite spreading mis-
information at almost every turn. She 
made a show of responding to the use of 
“people who menstruate” rather than 
“women” in a sarcastic tweet. As both 
a woman in her 50s and a professional 
writer, she should know the two terms 
are not synonymous, transgender 
people notwithstanding — menopause 
exists, as do hysterectomies. On her 
website, in response to the condemna-
tion she got for her tweets, she wrote, 
“When you throw open the doors of 
bathrooms and changing rooms to any 
man who believes or feels he’s a woman 
— and, as I’ve said, gender confirma-
tion certificates may now be granted 
without any need for surgery or hor-
mones — then you open the door to any 
and all men who wish to come inside. 
That is the simple truth.” This would 
have merit if we had bouncers at every 
bathroom door, but we don’t. Nothing 
was ever stopping men from walking 
into a women’s restroom — they won’t 

go through the trouble of getting a cer-
tificate to do it now. Sex crimes perpe-
trated by someone to take advantage of 
the legal provisions afforded to trans-
gender people are rare. Trans people 
avoiding bathrooms out of fear and 
trans youth being sexually assaulted 
because they couldn’t choose the saf-
est bathroom are depressingly com-
mon. That is the simple truth.
These deceptive claims do have 
shreds of truth to them in that people 
who menstruate are typically women 
and men aren’t physically prevented from 
entering female restrooms. The same 
cannot be said of many of Rowling’s other 
arguments. She warns of “the increasing 
numbers (of trans people) who seem to 
be detransitioning.” In truth, they are 
overwhelmingly the minority. Eight 
percent of trans people have detransi-
tioned, the majority only doing so tem-
porarily, and the most common reason 
is pressure from parents; in full, only 
0.4 percent of trans people detransition 
after realizing transitioning wasn’t for 
them. To claim the risk of regretting 
transition is significant is a bold-faced 
lie. The risks associated with detransi-
tioning are far more real and far worse; 
people who detransitioned in some 
fashion were almost twice as likely to 
attempt suicide than those who hadn’t. 
Even more blatant a lie is the claim that 
minors are being prescribed hormones 
indiscriminately. It is downright impos-
sible for anyone in the United Kingdom, 
Rowling’s own country, to start hor-
mones until they are 16 — and those who 
do start so young have to go through 
plenty of other hoops first. Sixteen is 
generally the earliest an American can 
start hormones as well. And yet, she 

likens hormone therapy to “conversion 
therapy” for gay and lesbian youth and 
claims hormones are overprescribed like 
antidepressants. (I wish I had known 
about that when I spent months search-
ing for a provider willing to see me for 
hormone replacement!) By the way, that 
“lifelong path of medicalisation” doesn’t 
need to be lifelong unless someone’s body 
can no longer produce sex hormones 
(they’re needed to prevent osteoporosis). 
Otherwise, you can stop at any time 
and your body will return to its natu-
ral hormone levels and even reverse 
many of the changes caused by hor-
mone replacement.
One of the most troubling aspects 
of Rowling’s rhetoric is how she dis-
guises it as being in the interest of cis-
gender women (e.g. public restrooms 
and “people who menstruate” tweets) 
and/or gay, bisexual and lesbian youth. 
Her “conversion therapy” argument is 
the most obvious example of the latter, 
comparing the very real, very horrific 
abuse of LGBTQ+ children (and yes, that 
includes conversion therapy specific 
to trans kids) to potentially life-saving 
health care that must purposefully be 
sought out and asked for, if one can even 
find a doctor who both can and will help 
them. This isn’t the first time Rowling 
has exploited gay people as a means 
to an end; claiming that Dumbledore, 
a main character in her Harry Potter 
series, was gay all along while refusing 
to write so much as a throwaway line to 
prove it is textbook queerbaiting.

J.K. Rowling’s transphobia isn’t just a Twitter rant

A

classic illustration of the 
problematic side of racial jus-
tice work is highlighted in the 
hit HBO series “Insecure,” where the 
leading character Issa Dee finds her-
self, a well-intentioned Black millen-
nial, navigating her unfulfilling career 
in a hilariously tone-deaf, mostly 
white nonprofit organization. “We Got 
Y’all,” the name of the organization, is 
in itself a play on words that comple-
ments the performative, hand-waving 
saviorism in which the non-Black, 
Indigenous and People of Color 
(BIPOC) who make up the organi-
zation use their mission of social 
justice to ultimately seem “heroic,” 
or like they’re “good” people, all 
while ignoring Issa’s opinions and 
consistently shutting her out.
Like Issa, I am also a Black millen-
nial female philanthropist. Like many 
University of Michigan students, I 
have spent my time on campus doing 
numerous outreach events to BIPOC 
youth in the Washtenaw County area 
and beyond, including Metro Detroit. 
I am also a director of a 501(c)(3) non-
profit organization that provides free 
music education in New York City to 
underprivileged children, the majority 
of whom are BIPOC. When the pan-
demic rattled New York City in early 
April, my organization was quick to 
leverage our privilege and influence 
to start a new virtual initiative with 
professional musicians and a focus on 
students in homeless shelters. When 
it came to COVID-19, our response 
was swift, intentional and unanimous. 
Then, the protests started. And, rather 
unsurprisingly, crickets chirped.
At first, I was hesitant to break the 
silence. Why wasn’t anybody saying 
anything? Isn’t the community we 
serve largely Black? Were they wait-
ing for me to say something — the 
sole Black person? Once I started 
composing my feelings, I realized I 
had more to say than I had for the last 
seven years of serving on the board. I 
finally realized that I had never really 
had a voice to begin with; I had never 
been listened to or approached for my 
opinion, and my voice had been con-
sistently ignored and diminished.
As we continue to be incited by 
anger and pain surrounding the 
untimely, unjust deaths of Black peo-
ple at the hands of police, we have 
become so much more empathetic. 
For those of us already working in 
the racial justice space — whether 
that means as philanthropists in 
nonprofits focused on racial ineq-
uity, as student volunteers in edu-
cational initiatives, as public school 
teachers or even as civil rights 
lawyers — the Black Lives Matter 
movement strikes a particularly 
stronger chord, since the pain and 

unjustness of systemic racism hit 
closer to home.
The question then becomes: If I am 
not Black and it is my job to address 
racial injustice, how can I be an ally to 
Black people without being a savior? 
The answer, quite frankly, is surpris-
ingly uncomplicated, and at the risk 
of sounding cliché, it starts by taking 
a look in the mirror.
The only fail-safe way to avoid 
being a savior to Black people is by 
first and foremost recognizing the 
fact that you are, in fact, not Black. 
The oppression of Black people and 
the anti-Black experience is not 
yours. The BLM movement is not 
yours to co-opt — you may not use it 
to seek praise or recognition for lit-
erally just doing your job when that 
job is to address racial injustice. Ask 
yourself this: Before the BLM move-
ment, was the purpose of your work 
to highlight your accomplishments, 
or to gain attention or notoriety in 
your profession? What, if anything, 
has changed now? Are you seeking 
to further yourself at the expense of 
Black people and a movement about 
the oppression of Black people to 
seem heroic or virtuous?
The racial justice space needs to 
revisit how we even approach racial 
inequity. The saviorism inherent in 
our work that might have once moti-
vated us must now be actively undone. 
Even if the actual work we do does not 
change as a result of this movement, 
it is time our philosophy does. Now, 
we must accept that it is not enough to 
provide a “helping hand” based on our 
privilege to address inequity. Instead, 
we must identify the root causes of 
these inequities and actively disman-
tle them. As for my organization, my 
advice to the board was to hire (and 
generously compensate) a Black pro-
fessional Diversity, Equity and Inclu-
sion consultant who is highly literate 
to help guide us. While it’s my job to 
address racial injustice as part of our 
organization’s mission, it’s not my 
job to fix our racism problem. And 
until my organization starts to look 
like the communities we serve, 
we’ll need to give more Black peo-
ple a seat at the table. Let us speak. 
Listen. Don’t silence us.
Black people, who have been con-
sistently dismissed, marginalized and 
exploited, are now facing a new threat: 
virtuous non-Black “allies.” If your 
job during the BLM movement is to 
address racial injustice, then treat it 
as such — your job. For once, this isn’t 
about you. This is not your story to tell. 

What if my job is to be a savior?

M

ake America Great Again 
— the motto of our current 
president, in reference to the 
distressed economy of the United States 
during the 2016 election. What if, how-
ever, America was never great in the first 
place? What if America does not need to 
return to the past, but reach for a new 
level of greatness? A 2017 survey from 
the Pew Research Center shows that a 
good proportion, right around 85 per-
cent, of Americans believe the U.S. either 
“stands above all other countries in the 
world” or is “one of the greatest coun-
tries, along with others.” The American 
population is patriotic and proud, but 
this patriotism blinds us from our faults. 
The idea that we are not great now, but 
must return to “former glory,” is claim-
ing that America used to be great despite 
its systemically racist institutions, mas-
sive economic inequality, disorganized 
healthcare system, horrific carbon 
emissions and more. America must not 
ignore these failures. It is easy to not 
feel the real urgency of a crisis until you 
see it with your own eyes. However, as a 
nation with a population of over 300 mil-
lion people, Americans must change this 
backward way of thinking to address 
these domestic problems.
Americans seem to have a sense of 
immunity when it comes to serious 
threats. We think because we are “above 
all other countries,” we will do things 
the best way possible and trust the gov-
ernment to ensure this. However, our 
government has proven itself extremely 
flawed and incompetent with respect 
to the deeply-rooted race problems 
embedded in our society as a result 
of slavery and in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
In American high schools, we were 
taught that the United States was por-
trayed as the savior. When other nations 
were struggling with corrupt leaders or 
war, the U.S. would step in and save the 
day with democracy (even if this meant 
replacing a just leader with a corrupt 
one). This teaching instills a sense of 
superiority in the American popula-
tion. As the 2017 Pew Research Center 
survey indicated that only 14 percent of 
Americans believe there are nations bet-
ter than the U.S., the people in power 
have failed at holding the government 
accountable for our own humanitarian 
crisis — the systemic and blatant racism 
that continues to plague this nation. 
This false sense of superiority has also 
led to the failure of containing COVID-
19, as only 56 percent of American adults 
view COVID-19 as a “real threat” as of 
March 17, 2020, which shows a drop of 
10 percentage points from the previous 
month. Similar to taking personal action 
against global warming, many Ameri-
cans prefer to not inconvenience them-

selves, often at the expense of others, 
because they have not seen the threat 
with their own eyes and therefore feel 
falsely immune to worldwide threats. It 
may be inconvenient to shop in person 
rather than online, eat less meat, recy-
cle, compost and use reusable cups, but 
these are small everyday changes that 
would make a difference towards a 
more sustainable future — just like 
wearing a mask can lower COVID-19 
transmission levels.
According to a PBS Marist poll, the 
percentage of Americans that view 
the pandemic as a “real threat” has 
decreased from February to March, 
while COVID-19 cases in the United 
States have continued to increase. Last 
year, I took a class called Philosophy 183: 
Critical Reasoning with Professor Anna 
Edmonds, a LEO Lecturer I. This class 
focused on the failures our brain makes 
when reasoning. One failure we studied 
was how the brain feels more comfort-
able with risks it has already survived. 
Once we have survived a risk for a period 
of time, the risk feels less and less scary, 
even if the probability of a negative out-
come remains the same or increases. 
As Americans continue to survive this 
pandemic without contracting COVID, 
their already heightened sense of 
immunity will only increase. 
America has done many great things 
of which its citizens should be proud 
of. The values of liberty and justice that 
define our goals in a democracy are great. 
But these values have not been achieved. 
The Pledge of Allegiance states, “with 
liberty and justice for all.” The U.S. has 
allowed this pledge to only apply to the 
white and wealthy of this nation for too 
long, with support for Black Lives Mat-
ter maxing at around 40 percent until 
the current rise of the movement.
It is time for Americans to wake up to 
reality and acknowledge that although 
greatness is achievable, we aren’t 
close. The first step toward progress is 
acknowledging that we as a nation are 
flawed. It has taken centuries for white 
Americans to realize how significant 
race inequity is throughout our judi-
cial, housing, law enforcement systems 
and more. Perhaps if students were 
taught current and historical crises in 
our own country and not just abroad, 
white Americans would be more able to 
reflect and make a change. If we want 
our nation to function as coherent and 
equitable and be truly great someday, we 
must hold our government accountable 
to protect the rights of ALL Americans, 
and be willing to sacrifice small incon-
veniences, like wearing a mask, for the 
greater good of the world.

T

he COVID-19 pandemic has 
forced colleges and universi-
ties in the United States to 
consider and implement alternative 
“public health-informed” fall semes-
ters. Many schools are trying to avoid 
an all-online semester, but as cases con-
tinue to rise in the U.S., remote classes 
are becoming increasingly unavoid-
able. On July 6, less than two months 
before most colleges are set to reopen, 
President Donald Trump’s adminis-
tration released a statement through 
the U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement that had the potential to 
further complicate potential reopen-
ing plans. According to the Student 
and Exchange Visitor Program, 
if a college is offering solely online 
classes, international students attend-
ing school would have two choices: 
transfer to a college offering some 
in-person classes or leave the country. 
On Tuesday, July 14, ICE rescinded 
this policy. While this is a huge win 
for international students, this rule 
should have never been proposed in 
the first place, and should force U.S. 
universities to reckon with the fact that 
international students are valued not 
for any potential economic contribu-
tions, but because they are students. 
This policy would have been a gross 
human rights violation that would 
have harmed international students. 
Every student has the right to learn 
and if they are here on a visa, the 
right to feel safe without the threat of 
removal. This policy infringes on both 
of those rights. Students who signed a 
lease for the academic semester would 
have been stuck with it, searching for 
a subletter in a market that has little to 
no demand. Students who are in their 

last year of school would no longer be 
able to graduate as planned, plunging 
them into further uncertainty and pil-
ing on financial difficulties. Students 
whose visas expire after the academic 
year would not be able to have them 
renewed, leaving them unable to 
return to the U.S. to finish their 
degree. Students forced to leave the 
U.S. would potentially be returning 
to unstable environments unsuit-
able for academic work and face 
challenges posed by faulty internet 
connection, inability to access edu-
cational resources, disruptive time 
differences and unsafe health condi-
tions in the midst of the pandemic.
Since ICE announced its student 
visa policy, many have invoked the 
economic benefits of international 
students as a counterargument. Uni-
versities in the U.S. have long relied on 
the revenue generated by international 
students’ tuition (international stu-
dents pay up to three times more than 
in-state students at public universities) 
and the fact that international students 
contribute $39 billion to the national 
economy. These arguments are harm-
ful in opposing human rights violations 
perpetrated by ICE. To reduce interna-
tional students to their economic value 
is degrading. To suggest that their 
rights should be protected relative to 
that economic value is immoral.
ICE has a disturbing reputation of 
dehumanizing those who do not enjoy 
the privileges of United States citizen-
ship. To defend international students 
from ICE based on their economic sta-
tus neglects the activism and struggle 
of marginalized groups — especially 
refugees, migrant workers and other 
undocumented individuals — that 

have long fought to abolish ICE with-
out the benefit of robust economic 
power. International students deserve 
protection from ICE not because of 
their economic contributions, but 
because everyone — from the wealthi-
est international student to the hum-
blest refugee at the border — deserves 
safety, dignity and belonging. 
Beyond defending basic human 
rights, this policy would have made 
even less sense on the stage of the glob-
al COVID-19 pandemic, and will likely 
increase the spread of the disease. The 
U.S. has over one million international 
students each year. Deporting even a 
fraction of these students and forcing 
them to travel in unsafe conditions 
creates a large risk for a second wave 
of COVID-19 to affect other countries 
that may have recovered or controlled 
the spread. The policy also would 
have put international students 
themselves at risk for contracting 
COVID-19 if forced to leave their 
current homes in the U.S. 
In the policy, ICE stated that inter-
national students would have the 
option to transfer to a school that is 
offering in-person classes. However, 
this option to transfer is not a true 
alternative. ICE made its announce-
ment less than two months before the 
beginning of the semester, rendering it 
nearly impossible for students to trans-
fer to another university based solely 
on the timing of application deadlines.

When I heard Quinn XCII’s single “Stacy” 
this past winter, I thought his upcom-
ing album would be similar to his previous 
album, From Michigan With Love. “Stacy,” a 
playful depiction of a rebellious relationship 
between a high school freshman and a senior, 
possesses the same contradictions we’ve seen 
in his previous albums where the upbeat 
nature of the music sharply contrasts with 
the heavy and often complicated subject mat-
ter of the lyrics. But that’s what Quinn XCII 
does best — he loves to pull difficult subjects 
and make them lightheartedly digestible.
Despite the cheerful singles he dropped in 
anticipation of the album’s release, A Letter 
To My Younger Self showcases Quinn XCII’s 
maturity and the amount of growth he’s expe-
rienced since his last album release. While 
this album grapples with many of the themes 
we’ve seen on his previous albums — mental 
illness, love and heartbreak — A Letter To 
My Younger Self takes these ideas and dis-
cusses them more honestly than they’ve been 
depicted before. 
One of the best examples of Quinn XCII’s 
growth is the most reflective tune on the 
album, “Second Time Around.” A pre-
released single just a few weeks before he 
dropped the album, this song was described 
by Quinn XCII as “the most powerful song 
I’ve ever made” on his Instagram. The tune 
is softer than anything we’ve heard from him 
before, with delicate piano riffs and a raw cut 
of his voice crooning about his regret for the 
mistakes he’s made in the past and his vow to 
be better in the future. The song also unveils 
Quinn XCII’s spiritual beliefs, something 
he’s kept out of his music in the past, as he 
addresses his concerns to God and expresses 
how he doesn’t believe he deserves a spot in 
heaven after what he’s done in the past. This 

reflective approach to songwriting contrasts 
starkly with his previous songs dealing with 
heavy subjects. While Quinn XCII has always 
been open about his battle with depression, 
he’s often glossed over the seriousness of 
the illness by playfully presenting the hard 
things he’s been through. “Sad Still,” a tune 
off his 2017 album The Story of Us, discusses 
depression in a simple way, as Quinn XCII 
chants “we take this red pill, green pill, black 
pill / I know deep down we’re sad still” over 
poppy drum beats and bubbly synths. “Sec-
ond Time Around” takes a completely dif-
ferent approach with Quinn XCII getting 
serious about how mental illness has impact-
ed him, and doesn’t shy away from honestly 
opening up about the hard things: “Been 
at war with myself / Makin’ my friends the 
enemy / I let all of them down.”
It’s no surprise Quinn XCII’s become more 
serious with his music. Since the release of 
From Michigan With Love he’s married and 
settled down with his new wife, spending his 
time away from music cooking or attending 
their friends’ weddings. While he’s still the 
goofy, open artist who earned him so many 
loyal fans, it’s clear he’s gotten a better grip 
on his life and career, and is now ready to 
open up about where he went wrong in the 
past. 
Despite its reflective nature, A Letter To 
My Younger Self isn’t completely somber. 
Songs like “Stacy,” “Coffee” and “Two 10s” 
embody Quinn XCII’s signature, unsystemat-
ic sound that incorporates unique drum beats 
and lighthearted electric guitar riffs that can 
only be characterized as the rap-reggae style 
of Quinn XCII. He also incorporated collabo-
rations with artists like Black Bear, Ashe and 
Logic in “Am I High Rn,” “Sleep While I Die” 
and the album’s title track.

SUMMER SERIES
SUMMER SERIES
Houston Ballet and 
the pain of distance

Much of ballet has to do with precision 
— exact placement is the gateway to physi-
cal strength and artistic allure. This dream 
of absolute clarity of movement is thus the 
founding goal of ballet training: toes that 
point but do not curl, ankles that rotate but 
do not roll, legs that turn out but only from 
the hips and never from the knees, ribs that 
lift off of the stomach and shoulders that 
remain relaxed and level below and long, lift-
ed neck. These rigid requirements, though 
necessary and impressive, are not physically 
natural. It takes years to sculpt a professional 
dancer’s body, and much of that time must 
take place in childhood alongside developing 
bones and muscles. The result is a physique 
that is strong and supple enough to enjoy 
the adventure of ballet’s art. Even still, that 
end product of adulthood is never actually 
finished: Rigorous daily classes must con-
tinuously remind one’s muscles about the 
distinct requirements of balletic anatomy. 
Stop practicing and the body will inevitably 
spring backward into its natural position. 
This, of course, is not easy. To maintain 
such well-oiled bodily machinery at the pro-
fessional level requires a substantial mix of 
blood, sweat and the occasional tear. This 
level of physical dedication is part of what 
makes ballet so otherworldly — there is mys-
tery in the difficulty of the steps performed 
— and it also makes ballet dancers some of 
the strongest psychological warriors of our 
time. They will work with the same inten-
sity and drive as a football player without the 
appealing draws of money or even fame. To 
keep going requires intense vision, usually 
with the constant inspiration of a moment 
onstage under the burning beauty of indus-
trial stage lights. 
These two facets of ballet’s world — a 
stage and a studio — tend to coexist out of 
their reliance on each other. Good perfor-
mance cannot happen without hard work in 
the studio; Hard work in the studio is diffi-
cult to motivate without good performance.
For years and generations this coexis-
tence worked seamlessly and productively 
in the creation of ballet. Dancers worked 
and learned with each other in the confines 
of humid dance studios, exchanging lessons 
and providing inspiration for each other to 
keep fighting for their shot on stage. Now, 
like many other previously accepted norms 
of society, COVID-19 halts the opportunity 
for such exchanges. Cancelled shows are 
of course heartbreaking events for dancers 
to bear, yet closed studios leave artists with 
little place to process such loss. Neither situ-

ation makes it any easier to maintain one’s 
well-sculpted technique, a level of fitness 
that begins to atrophy after a week, let alone 
a few months. Left to maintain their physi-
cality alone and handle the mental stress of 
an art world in shambles, dancers continue 
to make do with living room floors and 
kitchen-counter barres. In an interview with 
her co-worker last week, New York City Bal-
let principal dancer Megan Fairchild said it 
best: “I’m miserable!” 
Enter Houston Ballet: Suddenly a ray of 
sunshine in the sea of gray clouds, the com-
pany gracefully disrupted the depression 
of ballet’s 2020 existence. Last week, they 
released a new short film aimed at main-
taining audience engagement and hopefully 
salvaging their hemorrhaging finances. The 
seven-minute extravaganza features all 61 
company artists as they bounce, jiggle and 
jive in an elation-inducing interpretation of 
Billy Idol’s 1980 “Dancing by Myself,” a song 
so perfectly crafted for quarantine that it’s 
hard to believe it’s 40 years old.
In the film, the dancers start out comically 
downtrodden — highlights include one man 
dragging his bathrobe through the kitchen 
while cradling a pint of ice cream and anoth-
er, also in pajamas, with his feet in the dryer. 
When the music starts, the loungewear-
covered artists start to bounce. One of the 
women has a bright green face peel. Then, 
they twist, jump and twirl. As the energy 
builds, their outfits change. Suddenly they’re 
outside: The world is bright, their clothes 
are even brighter. They’re swaying and spin-
ning and throwing their arms. They’re happy 
to move, excited to dance. The whole thing is 
masterfully edited and joyfully acted — and, 
it includes barely any ballet technique. 
Each of these dancers is classically 
trained. They know all the rules — they’re 
just not following them. Their shoulders 
can move and their knees can bend. Their 
toes don’t have to point and their legs need 
not turn out. At the same time, they are still 
wholeheartedly ballet dancers. Even in their 
pajamas, they move with a grace that’s quite 
impossible to acquire unless you’ve spent 
your entire childhood in a ballet studio. 
Their fingers don’t forget the distinct mold 
of a ballet dancer’s hand and their knees 
swivel without the joltiness of a layman. 
Even slouched, turned in and ready-to-roll, 
they do not shed the inherent liftedness of 
ballet’s mold. In this vein, they become 
strung across two existences, flying above us 
and walking among us in the same count of 
eight.

MUSIC REVIEW
MUSIC REVIEW


In an age where thousands of films get 

made every year, there’s often a push to make 
something different. This is how you ended up 
with rom-coms like “Love Wedding Repeat,” 
a recent Netflix film that ruined its characters 
with a complicated multiverse plot, or with 
Adam Sandler movies with fantastical plots. 
Most of these attempts to reinvent the wheel 
falter under the pressure of their own story-
line, trying to pull something meaningful out 
of a jumble of half-baked ideas.

Delightfully, “Palm Springs” was not one 

of these.

If “Palm Springs” is a water park ride, 

it starts off as a Lazy River, meandering its 
way through exposition like a typical wed-
ding movie. You meet Nyles (Andy Samberg, 
“Brooklyn Nine-Nine”), a relaxed but dis-
gruntled wedding guest, and Sarah (Cristin 
Milioti, “How I Met Your Mother”), one of 
the bridesmaids for the bride, her sister Tala 
(Camila Mendes, “Riverdale”). After the two 
meet, it only takes about 10 minutes for the 
plot to explode as the roller coaster takes off: 
Nyles is stuck in an infinite time loop, à la 
“Groundhog Day,” and he accidentally pulls 
Sarah into it.

The filmmakers’ ability to successfully pull 

off a plot of these proportions is a miracle, and 
even more so that they were able to fit it into 
a tight 90 minutes. And yet “Palm Springs” 
is brilliantly done, held together by a strong 
ensemble cast and a well-written story. It 
doesn’t hurt that the film is produced by The 
Lonely Island, an absurdist comedy troupe 
made up of childhood friends Samberg, Akiva 
Schaffer and Jorma Taccone. Having The 
Lonely Island team as producers brings plen-
ty of their zany comedic choices — a fight end-

ing with a fork stuck into someone’s face, for 
example, could’ve come straight out of one of 
their digital shorts on “Saturday Night Live.”

Like many rom-coms, the success of the 

film is dependent on its two leads; in this case, 
Samberg and Milioti are an excellent match. 
Even as Sarah is trying to understand what’s 
going on, Nyles has long collapsed into the 
monotony of the time loop — a juxtaposition 
that is chaotic but effective. Both Samberg 
and Milioti’s performances are charming and 
compelling, subtly displaying their distress 
and helplessness without ever losing their 
comedic timing. As the time loop continues, 
the two come to a nihilistic consensus, choos-
ing to give up and waste time. This leads to a 
number of delightful montages of their time 
in the loop: relaxing in the pool, making reck-
less choices, choreographed dances and more.

It doesn’t hurt that this film came out dur-

ing quarantine, where, for many of us, every 
day is the same as the day before. Nyles and 
Sarah’s choices to waste time feel especially 
real when your own life has been somewhat 
monotonous for months. For them, the days 
only broken up by their drunken adventures 
or the occasional appearance of violent and 
vengeful Roy (J.K. Simmons, “Whiplash”). 
Still, the mental transition as the time loop 
continues is visible in their appearance — 
both of them become increasingly, but subtly, 
disheveled over time. Truthfully, this is a film 
that’s made to watch more than once: Fleet-
ing moments end up being far more indicative 
that there’s more going on. In a movie where 
the same day repeats over and over again, I 
didn’t think there would be any spectacular 
twists, but there are — and they completely 
change how the rest of the film is viewed.

It’s the early 2010s in New York, and 

Maria Griffiths, a trans woman in her late 
twenties and the protagonist of Imogen 
Binnie’s 2013 novel “Nevada,” is writing a 
blog post in an internet café. After recap-
ping the strange few days she’s had, she 
turns to a speculative exercise: 

“I imagine that you’re familiar with 

all the stereotypes around transsexual 
women: that we’re all sex workers, that 
we’re all hairy, potbellied old men, that 
we’re all deep-voiced nightlife phoenixes, 
that we’re all drag queens, that we’re all 
repressed, that we’re all horny shemales 
with twelve-inch cocks…. Can we talk 
about what the actual stereotypes around 
transsexual women should be. The ones 
that hit a little too close to be funny.” 

The taxonomy of trans women that 

Maria goes on to write is really more of 
a self-portrait. Trans women are, she 
writes, addicted to the internet (the place 
that guided many of us out of the closet) 
and often a little socially inept, awkward, 
unsure how to take up space in the world. 
Maria notes that “trans women try to shirk 
their male privilege before transitioning, 
disappear into themselves, and then can 
never really get back out to become asser-
tive, present, feminist women.” 

Binnie’s novel is concerned, in a large 

part, with the problem implied in this 
blog post — how do you become a person 
when you’ve been avoiding yourself for so 
long before transitioning? Maria doesn’t 
have an answer, although she’s very good 
at identifying and picking apart her prob-
lems, relating them back to the structures 
of oppression she’s learned to identify. It’s 
just that she can’t get from there to a deci-
sion. Maria is painfully passive, almost 
directionless in her inability to assert 
herself. 

The novel opens with a crisis that forc-

es Maria to act, something she’s unused 
to doing: Her girlfriend Steph, over vegan 
brunch one day, tells her that she cheated 
on her with a mutual friend. Maria’s reac-
tion is to shut down: “She’s still there, still 
watching, wishing there were something 
to say but really all she can think is, okay, 
whatever.” She goes to work like noth-
ing happened, only remembering later 
that she should probably do something. 
Something like talk to Steph about it. She 
doesn’t, though. She doesn’t even think 
about it too much. “The more she tries to 
think about it, whittle it down to how she 
feels about their relationship, the slip-
perier it gets. Thinking about Steph is like 

trying to squeeze a fish.”

Instead, her thoughts rove over every-

thing else — her job at a Strand-esque 
bookstore in Manhattan, her past, her 
unresolved conflict with her own trans-
ness — while she avoids Steph for two 
days. It becomes increasingly appar-
ent that this crisis struck her in such 
a way as to expose the fault lines of her 
tenuously maintained existence, and she 
spends most of the first half of the book 
unpacking her own life in a long, unspool-
ing inner monologue. Maria’s life has 
depended on her own ability to avoid her-
self that during this moment of crisis the 
avoidance starts to take on the air of self-
sabotage. She’s late for work a few times 
and gets fired, right after Steph breaks 
up with her before she has a chance to do 
it first. Suddenly, she’s homeless-ish and 
jobless in one of the most expensive cities 
in America. 

At this point in the narrative, Maria’s 

avoidant tendencies go into overdrive: she 
borrow-steals Steph’s car and decides to 
road-trip across America. As you might 
have guessed, this doesn’t help either. 

When next we see her, she hasn’t show-

ered in weeks and has just arrived at a 
Wal-Mart in a small town in Nevada. 
Before we see her again, though, we 
meet James, a local, who is “hotboxing 
the bathroom of his apartment halfway 
down the hill from the Wal-Mart.” He’s 
just had an argument with his girlfriend 
Nicole, and the only reason he’s getting 
stoned instead of making amends is that 
“she’s right to be mad: there is something 
wrong with him. He has no idea what 
the fuck it is, but he does need to figure 
it out if he’s ever going to have a normal 
human relationship.” If you get the sense 
that James’s internal monologue resem-
bles Maria’s, you’re right: When he’s not 
watching art-house films or getting high, 
James fantasizes endlessly and tortuously 
about becoming a woman. Unlike Maria, 
James’s particular avoidance takes the 
form of abusing marijuana and mastur-
bating a lot, but it’s avoidance nonethe-
less. 

When they meet, the two of them are 

mutually fascinated with each other — 
James because he has never met a trans 
woman before, and Maria because she’s 
certain James is also trans and doesn’t 
realize it yet. They establish an uneasy 
rapport, get high together, and eventually 
decide to drive to nearby Reno together.

The Asian Greek life community’s role in rape 
culture and misogyny

CW: Sexual assault, rape, emo-
tional manipulation.
**
Over the past few weeks, stories 
of sexual assault, manipulation and 
rape have surged my Instagram 
homepage. In this second wave of 
the #MeToo movement, much of 
what has been circulating around 
is coming from my Asian-Ameri-
can community. This time, it feels 
more surreal as I hear from victims 
and perpetrators with whom I am 
acquainted. Both groups consist 
of people who have walked down 
the same hallways I walked, been 
to the same events and fraternity 
parties my friends have been to and 
currently live in the same neigh-
borhood my friends and I live in. 
The prevalence and proximity of 
these stories are frightening, and 
it’s concerning to think about the 
many more left untold. 
These 
survivors 
have 
held 
months or years of emotional bag-
gage and are using this movement 
as an opportunity to release their 
built-up torment. However, in an 
attempt to speak up against their 
perpetrators and empower others 
who may have gone through a simi-
lar experience, some victims are 
met with backlash and criticism.

You slip on your coin skirt, 
your vibrant colored scarf and 
you declare yourself a “gypsy” for 
Halloweekend. Your most grave 
concern is what color lipstick will 
best suit your costume. You take no 
second thought about the struggle 
for liberation, the painful hate 
crimes and systemic oppression 
of the “gypsy” you are dressed as 
endures. 
The idea of a “gypsy,” which 
you believe to be an exotic Hal-
loween costume, is rather a racial 
slur assigned to the Roma people 
(Romanis) intended to subside 
their value and isolate them in 
society. Romanis are a group of 
people originally from the Pun-
jab region of northern India. They

are known as travelers because of 
their historic migration through 
the Middle East — some through 
northern Africa — into Europe; 
they are now the largest minority 
group in Europe. However, even 
with 12 million Romanis residing 
in the European Union and 1 mil-
lion in the United States, there is no 
political power or representation 
for their ethnic group in govern-
ment.
For centuries, Roma people have 
been victims of chattel slavery in 
Eastern Europe which only ended 
in 1860. Today, the Romani are still 
victims of institutionalized racism; 
they are not provided adequate 
healthcare, lack sufficient access to 
education and have segregated liv-
ing conditions. At least 90 percent 
of the Roma people live below the 
poverty line in Europe. Even the

Alpha Kappa Delta Phi Sorority sis-
ter, recently shared a post on social 
media (which has since been taken 
down) of her alleged experience of 
having consensual sex with a fra-
ternity brother and later discover-
ing she was involuntarily filmed 
doing so by her ex-boyfriend, a 
UNCC Pi Alpha Pi Fraternity 
brother. This brother allegedly sent 
this video to a Snapchat group chat 
consisting of his pledge brothers 
and slut-shamed her for “hitting 
up all his pbros on the East Coast,” 
which Mai denied. This post has 
been taken down but a screenshot 
of it is below. After sharing her 
story on Instagram, members of 
the Pi Alpha Phi Fraternity across 
several universities on the East 
Coast began to condemn her in a 
Facebook Messenger group chat 
–– a chat that @ktlyndng posted 
screenshots of. Many commented 
on her appearance, calling her 
“ugly” and “fat,” and implied she 
and other victims are only speaking 
out now for attention. One member 
even said he had already seen about 
15 posts about rape and joked that 
he should make one about “how 
[he] was raped by bros.” 
As a result of these messages sur-
facing on social media, Pi Alpha Phi 
National Fraternity addressed the 
situation along with its other sex-
ual misconduct, assault and exploi-
tation allegations through a public 
statement. According to the state-

ment, all fraternity activities across 
all chapters were indefinitely sus-
pended as of July 4. They hired a 
law firm to investigate the allega-
tions of sexual misconduct and 
asked for an independent investi-
gator to investigate the institution 
and third party firm to review the 
organization. The National Board 
of Directors also asserted to hold 
their brothers accountable and to 
rebuild the foundational culture of 
their fraternity in the meantime. 
However, many commenters on 
the Instagram post expressed out-
rage at their response and are skep-
tical of the fraternity’s plans to rid 
their organization of rape culture 
and misogyny. They criticize the 
board’s decision to reach out to law 
enforcement, as many women do 
not report sexual violence for fear 
of reprisal, or the belief the police 
will not help or that further harm 
might be brought to them. Com-
menters are also doubtful of how 
rebuilding the fraternity would 
lead to change as “fraternity cul-
ture was founded on misogynis-
tic principles” and “enable toxic 
masculinity,” @kathytrinh com-
mented. Some are demanding 
more actions to be taken, such as 
de-lettering the members in the 
aforementioned group chat and 
even disbanding the entire frater-
nity. The fraternity has not further 
responded since the statement. 
Pi Alpha Phi is only one of the 

many organizations in the Asian 
Greek life community with sexual 
assault and misconduct allega-
tions. Its sister sorority, Alpha 
Kappa Delta Phi, has also allegedly 
enabled rape and sexual assault. 
University of Buffalo student, Ami, 
recounts the night her friend and 
at-the-time fraternity pledge — 
under the pseudonym, Z — alleged-
ly raped her in an instagram post. 
Ami allegedly told their friend, 
and at-the time a aKDPhi pledge, 
what Z had done to her. Even so, 
their friend kept her ties to him for 
Greek life connections and put Ami 
in more situations which allowed 
Z to continue sexually violating 
and traumatizing her. Ami claims 
the sisters of aKDPhi have used 
her story to take action against the 
brothers of Z’s fraternity but are 

not seeking repercussions for their 
friend’s involvement. 
The chapter has responded with 
a public statement to show their 
support with survivors and con-
demn acts of sexual assault. Ami 
feels the chapter is hypocritical as 
she reached out to them for help a 
while back and was told the situa-
tion was a personal matter, yet the 
sisters were quick to post an apol-
ogy three days after Ami publicly 
shared her story. 
So far, 37 chapters across eight 
Asian-interest fraternities alleg-
edly have at least one sexual assault 
allegation made against at least one 
of their brothers — including Uni-
versity of Michigan’s chapter of 
Lambda Phi Epsilon. 

Roma individuals who found suc-
cess in their communities are reluc-
tant to claim their identity, affected 
by society-imposed shame. 
As sinister as this systemic dis-
crimination is, some European 
officials do not bother to hide the 
cruelty directed towards the Roma 

people. In 2013, Hungarian politi-
cal figure Zsolt Bayer claimed: “A 
significant part of the Roma are 
unfit for coexistence. They are 
not fit to live among people. These 
Roma are animals, and they behave 
like animals.” This perpetuates a 
social stigma and normalizes the 

abuse for the Roma community. 
Hence, it does not come as a sur-
prise to hear governments have 
coerced sterilization upon the 
Roma women with intersectional 
intentions: racism and eugenics.

Stained-glass windows encompass

In the evening, I drive to my

ily situation my entire life. I’m a 
first-generation American with a 
Catholic-raised father from Iraq 
and a Muslim-raised mother from 
Lebanon. Even though my extend-
ed family has been vastly accepting 
and tolerant of our dual-religious 
dynamic, I find it difficult to 
explain to my friends, teachers and 
even strangers that it is possible 
to be raised inter-faithfully. This 
notion was seemingly too complex 
for the masses to comprehend. The 
Muslim community viewed me as 
a complete outsider and my Catho-
lic school classmates didn’t even 
consider me to be a “real” Catho-
lic. I felt as though my completion 
of Baptism and Confirmation was 
invalidated merely because I didn’t 
regularly attend Sunday mass.
Regardless of the unsolicited 
criticism from my peers, I consid-
er myself vastly fortunate to have 
been brought up with such reli-
gious duality. I learned religious 
tolerance from a young age, and I 

never devoutly practiced one reli-
gion or claimed I belonged to one. 
Rather than my parents negotiat-
ing a settlement between Catholi-
cism and Islam, they celebrated 
both and were transparent with the 
differences between the two faiths 
instead of surpressing one. Grow-
ing up surrounded by both Catholi-
cism and Islam has allowed me to 
integrate two worldviews despite 
the fact that both faiths have been 
in conflict with one another my 
entire life. In fact, as I emerge into 
adulthood and further delve into 
what I truly believe, I have gained 
a greater sense of respect for my 
parents for not coercing me to fol-
low a singular religion and allow-
ing me to make my own decisions 
about what I believe. My dual-faith 
upbringing has given me the free-
dom to compare and contrast in a 
way which is often hardly encour-
aged in a single-faith setting. 
Of course, there are myths that 
growing up with two religions 

causes a child to become confused 
or forces them to ally with one 
side, but in reality this couldn’t be 
further from the truth. Both faiths 
embrace certain truths which reso-
nate with me. Despite the absence 
of my allegiance to one religion, 
I have still been able to dissect 
the aspects of each faith I feel as 
though I truly believe in: humil-

ity, selflessness, courage, peace and 
patience.
I’ve recognized the inherent 
similarities of each religion, and I 
don’t believe them to be so differ-
ent. At the end of the day, there will 
always be Catholics and Muslims 
who hold judgements against...

What, rather than who, treats an 
individual as a vessel, which can be 
filled with so much contents

To be mixed race is to be hyper-

unique blend of manifested fea-
tures, 
The outcome of lack of belonging
An embodiment of distance from

Creation of those that stray from

I am known for what I carry, but 
never valued for who I am

That I am hollow, worthless

Because the only answer more 
pleasurable for him than a real 
explanation is a moment of mys-
tery, a fulfillment of fantasy
And my identity has always been 
about fantasy

than the vessel which cradles it
Yet, I give it shape, but my 
miracle of making it valuable and 
attainable, the pearl of the matter,

Michigan releases plan for ticketing at fall sporting events

Michigan answered one of the 
many questions surrounding this 
year’s uncertain situation for fall 
sports on Wednesday, releasing its 
plan for football tickets.
This fall, there will be no season 
tickets and no tickets open to the 
general public. Instead, individual 

game tickets will be sold to a mix of 
season ticket holders and students 
as capacity permits — a number 
still undecided.
“We have been working closely 
with a wide variety of leaders 
to ensure a safe and healthy 
environment 
for 
our 
student-
athletes, coaches, fans and support 
staff associated with a game at 
Michigan 
Stadium,” 
athletic 

director Warde Manuel said in 
a statement. “We will follow the 
direction that all of these agencies 
and experts continue to provide 
during this challenging time.”
While all season-ticket holders 
who purchased a deal will have 
their seating location reserved 
for the 2021 season regardless, 
the University is offering three 
different plans to for what to do 

with 
the 
money 
season-ticket 
holders have already given.
They will have the option to 
convert their payment into a tax-
deductible 
gift 
to 
Michigan’s 
athletic department, an option that 
will alleviate the pressure brought 
on by COVID-19 slightly.
Season-ticket holders could also 
add their purchase towards paying 
for 2021 season tickets, making 

those year’s tickets cheaper. Or, 
they could request a refund.
“Once a final decision on the 
football 
season 
is 
made, 
the 
athletic ticket office will follow 
up with additional details on how 
to request the option for PSC and 
season tickets,” the statement 
reads. “Season ticket holders do 
not need to take any action at this 
time.”

Impacts of a conference-only schedule

In a decision that created more 
questions than it answered, the Big 
Ten Conference ruled in favor of a 
conference-only schedule for all fall 
sports on Thursday. And while Big 
Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren’s 
audible keeps the hope of fall sports 
alive — for the time being — it will 
cause significant changes in the way 
student-athletes and coaches prepare 
for the upcoming season.
The Michigan football team is no 
different.
The idea of a 10-game Big Ten 
slate has floated around since the 
conference’s 
announcement 
on 
Thursday afternoon, but there’s no 
formal word yet regarding what to 
expect or when to expect it. Some Big 
Ten teams, including the Wolverines, 
have even pulled their original 2020 
schedule off their official websites.
For now, let’s operate under the 
working assumption that a nine or 
10-game Big Ten schedule is in store 
for this fall. From position battles to 
a sense of urgency, The Daily breaks 
down how Michigan is impacted most 
by the Big Ten’s decision to impose a 
conference-only schedule:
How 
does 
this 
affect 
the 
Wolverines’ quarterback battle?
Between senior Dylan McCaffrey 
and junior Joe Milton, the winner of 
Michigan’s quarterback competition 
may not have a particularly long leash.
Given the abbreviated season and 
lack of postseason expansion, the 
Wolverines won’t be able to afford 
many unnecessary hiccups if they 
want to pursue a conference title, let 
alone a College Football Playoff berth. 
The circumstances of this season’s 
title race will be far from normal, 
meaning a potential bump or two 
in the road could be enough to force 
coach Jim Harbaugh’s hand into a 

quarterback change.
But if the conference-only schedule 
delays the season by multiple weeks, 
the Wolverines will have ample time 
to allow the battle to play out.
At this point, that’s Harbaugh’s sole 
focus.
“I’m very excited about the 
quarterbacks that are on the roster 
right now,” Harbaugh said during 
a 
teleconference 
with 
reporters 
Wednesday. “… I see the drive that they 
have, which is very high. And they’ve 
been tremendous leaders, especially 
Dylan and Joe and (sophomore) Cade 
(McNamara) through the virtual 
meetings, the virtual workouts. Doing 
the right things, it’s very important to 
them.”
Whether or not a clear signal-caller 
emerges, however, remains to be seen.
Michigan can’t afford to ease 
into the season
Even before news of a conference-
only football schedule emerged, 
easing into the season wasn’t much of 
an option for the Wolverines.
With a Week 1 trip to perennial 
Pac-12 
contender 
Washington 
previously on the docket, the coaching 
staff already had little time to replace 
a host of starters from last season’s 
team, including 13 who signed NFL 
contracts this offseason. But now, 
without a trip to Seattle and home 
games against Arkansas State and Ball 
State, Michigan will have even less 
time to incorporate its new faces. That 
includes playmakers such as incoming 
freshmen wideouts A.J. Henning and 
Roman Wilson, who each ran verified 
sub-4.50 40-yard dash times in high 
school.
Non-conference games would’ve 
provided an ideal opportunity to add 
a valuable dimension of explosive 
speed on offensive and special 
teams — something second-year 
offensive coordinator Josh Gattis 
has mentioned time and time again. 
For now, however, all that’s left is a 

message that hinges on preparation 
and uncertainty.
“The thing (the staff) suggested 
and I think they really bought into 
was, ‘The providence will favor 
the prepared,’ ” Harbaugh said. “… 
Better to be prepared and not have 
the opportunity than to have the 
opportunity and not be prepared.”
It’s anything but an ideal year 
to break in four new starting 
offensive linemen
There’s never a good time to replace 
four starting offensive linemen, but in 
a normal season, playing a trio of non-
conference games would’ve helped get 
the new faces up to speed.
Even more importantly, it would’ve 
helped offensive line coach Ed 
Warinner and the rest of the staff 
determine who those starters will be. 
Returning right tackle Jalen Mayfield 
appears set to headline the unit, 
while fellow junior Ryan Hayes is the 
likeliest candidate for the other tackle 
spot. The other three starting roles 
are up for grabs, with senior Chuck 
Filiaga, senior Andrew Stueber and 
sophomore Karsen Barnhart duking it 
out for the two guard spots and fifth-
year senior Andrew Vastardis and 
sophomore Zach Carpenter battling 
for the starting center nod.
While replacing four NFL-bound 
starters is no small task, it appears 
Michigan is off to a solid start.
“Overall, I would say (the offensive 
line) looks good,” Harbaugh said. 
“It looks good right now. Both from 
a strength standpoint, really good 
length there and the athleticism 
is really good in that group. … 
Individually, they’ve definitely done a 
great job of understanding the system 
— installs have been probably installed 
three times, if not four. Mentally very 
sharp, and guys are knowing what 
they’re doing.”
Beyond Mayfield, though, the 
Wolverines won’t have many answers 
until they’re thrown into the fire. 

Big Ten to move to fully 
in-conference schedule

Just 
one 
day 
after 
Jim 
Harbaugh 
said 
he 
would 
“want the responsibility of 
keeping our players safe and 
educating them” by having a 
football season, the Big Ten is 
planning to play a conference-
only schedule, if the season 
happens at all, per a source. The 
Athletic’s Nicole Auerbach first 
reported the news.
“My 
thoughts 
would 
be, 
it’s a different conversation if 
there’s no students on campus,” 
Harbaugh said Wednesday. “If 
students are on campus, then 
my personal belief as a parent 
of a daughter who would also 
be on campus that this is a safe 
place.”
As first reported by ESPN, 
the ruling will extend to all 
fall sports, affecting men’s 
and women’s soccer, men’s and 
women’s cross country, field 
hockey, and volleyball.
“If the Conference is able to 
participate in fall sports based 
on medical advice, it will move 
to Conference-only schedules 
in those sports,” the conference 
said in an official statement. 

“Details for these sports will be 
released at a later date.
“... This decision was made 
following 
many 
thoughtful 
conversations 
over 
several 
months between the Big Ten 
Council 
of 
Presidents 
and 
Chancellors, 
Directors 
of 
Athletics, Conference Office 
staff, 
and 
medical 
experts 
including the Big Ten Task 
Force for Emerging Infectious 
Diseases and the Big Ten Sports 
Medicine Committee.”
For 
the 
football 
team, 
the 
ruling 
will 
cause 
the 
cancelation of its scheduled 
games 
at 
Washington, 
vs. 
Ball State and vs. Arkansas 
State. While the Ball State and 
Arkansas State games were one-
time matchups, the Wolverines 
are currently scheduled to play 
Washington in Ann Arbor in 
2021 as part of a home-and-
home series.
As for the rest of Michigan’s 
schedule, it is unclear whether 
the Big Ten will add additional 
conference games to replace 
the three lost games — if 
the current plans hold up as 
coronavirus 
cases 
escalate 
across the country.

Hintons, parents support fall shift

On Thursday afternoon, just one 
day after he went viral for saying, 
“There’s no expert view right now 
that I’m aware of that sports is 
going to make (COVID-19) worse,” 
Jim Harbaugh sat down for a Zoom 
call with all of his players’ parents.
It was far away from the 
spotlight, in an environment that 
better suits the Michigan coach. 
No quotes from that Zoom will 
gain virality or even be posted on 
the internet. But to the parents 
of Wolverines’ players, this is the 
Harbaugh that matters.
This Harbaugh was answering a 
list of their questions — 22 of them 
to be precise, all focusing on how 
Michigan was dealing with college 
football’s return to play amid the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
It was a list borne out of concern 
back in late May, when the NCAA 
announced it would allow athletes 
to return to campus for voluntary 
workouts. At the time, something 
didn’t sit right with Chris and Mya 
Hinton, the parents of Michigan 
defensive lineman Chris Hinton Jr.
As they looked at the guidelines 
put in place by all 130 Football Bowl 
Subdivision programs and 10 FBS 
conferences, they realized there 
was no consistency. “No guidance, 
there was no protocol that schools 
had to adhere to,” Chris Sr. told The 
Daily. “They just gave the date and 
said, ‘Have at it.’ ”
So the Hintons started reaching 
out to parents of other college 

football players and realized they 
weren’t alone in their concern. 
After getting feedback from some 
of those parents, they founded the 
Facebook group, College Football 
Parents 24/7. Just over a month 
later, it has 1,558 members and 
counting.
Before the Hintons air their 
grievances, they want you to know 
something. They are rabid college 
football fans. Their other son, Myles, 
is a freshman offensive lineman 
at Stanford. Chris Sr. starred at 
Northwestern in the 1980s before 
his All-Pro NFL career. So they 
want a college football season more 
than just about anyone.
“We just want it to be done right 
and safely,” Chris said. “We want 
our sons to be safe, as any other 
parent would want.”
At Michigan, that’s a feeling 
that 
Harbaugh 
has 
cultivated 
throughout the past five months.
Even though the NCAA is 
permitting full practices beginning 
Monday, Michigan’s players will 
continue training in groups of eight, 
as they have since returning to 
campus. The groups are consistent 
day-to-day and are designed to 
partner players with their closest 
friends so as to minimize contact 
between groups out of training.
Of course, getting to a season 
would require the full team to 
practice 
together 
as 
normal. 
To ensure that next step can be 
executed safety, Michigan has 
implemented 
a 
robust 
testing 
system, 
as 
well 
as 
exploring 
innovative solutions such as bands 
that players can wear to help with 

contact tracing and avoid a large-
scale breakout.
Perhaps most encouraging to 
the Hintons, though, is how these 
decisions came about. While the 
program comes from Michigan’s 
own medical experts, Harbaugh 
has valued parents’ opinions from 
the beginning, sending out a survey 
before players returned to campus 
so that the team could implement 
the protocols parents wanted to see.
“It was refreshing because from 
day one, we feel like Michigan has 
done a good job with dealing with 
COVID the best they can with the 
knowledge that’s available,” Mya 
said. “There’s so much unknown 
with the science, but they’re doing 
everything they can.”
It’s a stark contrast, Mya says, 
from some other schools across the 
country, particularly in the SEC. 
One parent in College Football 
Parents 24/7 has a son playing at 
Notre Dame — a school with strict 
protocols in place — and expressed 
concern when she found out that 
Arkansas, 
the 
Fighting 
Irish’s 
scheduled Week 2 opponent, was 
only testing if players showed 
symptoms.
In order to avoid situations such 
as that one, many parents have 
lobbied for teams to exclusively play 
conference games, a measure that 
enables more consistent protocols 
to be in place between opponents. 
Earlier this week, the Big Ten 
became the first conference to heed 
that advice.
“The 
idea 
that 
now, 
it’s 
conference-only play, you don’t 
have to worry about a school that’s 
upholding the same standards 
that you are,” Chris said. “And 
that was one of the things that we 
talked about early was the lack of 
consistency from school to school, 
to know that, say, Wisconsin is 
doing the same thing that you’re 
doing.”
But while the Hintons support 
the measures Michigan and the Big 
Ten have put in place, they — and 
other parents — remain concerned, 
with cases on the rise across the 
country.
“It’s scary to think that football 
would be ramping it up as cases are 
going up,” Chris said. “Typically an 
epidemiologist would say cases are 
spiking so we need to distance more, 
and we’re doing the opposite.”
With the scheduled start of 
football season less than two 
months away, that’s a daunting 
thought no matter what guidelines 
are in place.

Warren emphasizes shift 
towards a flexible fall

On Thursday afternoon, Big 
Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren 
made one thing clear: nothing is set 
in stone. 
The press conference followed 
a statement by the Big Ten saying 
fall sports would be restricted to a 
conference-only schedule. 
“One of the things that was most 
important to us was the flexibility 
of scheduling all the operations,” 
Warren said in an interview on the 
Big Ten Network. “It’s much easier 
if we’re just working with our Big 
Ten institutions from a scheduling 
standpoint, 
from 
a 
traveling 
standpoint, all of those issues that 
go into having our student athletes 
compete.”
He stressed that all decisions 
have been made with the safety 
and wellbeing of student athletes at 
the forefront. 
With the national situation 
constantly evolving, Warren and 
his staff believe canceling non-
conference competition will give 
athletes “the best chance to play,” 
but canceling the fall sports season 
altogether remains on the table. 
Meaning, 
the 
announcement 
should be looked at more as an ‘if’ 
the season happens than a ‘when.’
Flexibility 
was 
stressed 
as 
a major factor in the Big Ten’s 
decisions. With the change, the 
conference will retain the ability 
to schedule games as they see 
fit, dictate travel and implement 
uniform 
testing 
policies. 
The 
conference 
will 
extend 
that 
flexibility to student athletes, 

honoring 
the 
scholarships 
of 
any athlete who decides not to 
participate in the season due to 
COVID-19. 
The 
announcement 
is 
the 
product 
of 
many 
hours 
of 
communication 
between 
the 
conferences’ coaches, presidents, 
chancellors 
and 
conference 
administrators. Warren said a new 
Big Ten football is in the works, but 
fans shouldn’t hold their breath. 
Testing procedures have to be 
finalized, networks contacted and 
medical professionals consulted 
with. 
It’s one thing to revamp an 
entire fall season from an office. 
It’s another matter entirely to 
orchestrate 
that 
change 
over 
Zoom. 
Warren said he’s been in daily 
contact with athletic directors 
and has talked to football coaches 
weekly. They hoped to get the 
decision out as soon as possible in 
an effort to remain transparent. 
“When you sit in a seat like this, 
you always have to make sure that 
you are always preparing for the 
what-if scenarios, many of which 
may never come to fruition,” 
Warren said. “They may just end 
up in a binder or a desk drawer or 
saved on a computer somewhere.”
With the number of COVID-
19 cases on the rise, the “what-if” 
scenarios are coming into play. 
Regardless of what the coming 
weeks or months bring, the Big Ten 
is clear in its priorities. 
“We’ll keep putting our student-
athletes at the top of our list,” 
Warren said. “And we’ll always 
make sure we look out for them and 
make sure they are keeping safe.”

Champion Farm: A family farm’s response to COVID-19

There’s an ambient humming 

noise 
inside 
the 
barn, 
an 

industrial sized fan circulating the 
sweltering heat and establishing a 
light breeze that moved through 
the straw covering the ground. 
Lindsay Champion enters the barn, 
breaking up the group of Jersey 
Cows gathered in front of the 
breeze. She leads the girls one by 
one to the opposite end of the room, 
tying them to the wall and spraying 
their legs with fly spray. Lindsay 
wheels in the milking equipment 
and sets up next to the first cow, 
who waits patiently throughout 
the process. Beginning with an 
iodine disinfectant solution and 
initial milking by hand, Lindsay 
connects the milking device once 
any bacteria has been cleared. 
The closed system makes the milk 
cleaner and safer for distribution 
to members of the herd share who 
receive milk from the Champion 
Family Farm. 

When the milking process is 

complete, Lindsay leads the cows 
out to pasture. The girls and the 
two calves follow her in a single-
file line to their designated area. 
The grass is tall in comparison 
to the plot next to it that was cut 
down by yesterday’s grazing. The 
silent solitude of the open field 
is disrupted by huffing, snorting, 
and tearing noises of grass being 
ripped from the ground as the 
cows spread out, chomping across 
the plot. They’ll stay here for the 
majority of the day, returning to 
the barn for the night when it is 
time for their second milking of 
the day at 11 p.m.

With the cows and milking 

taken care of, everyone’s attention 
is turned to preparing for the 
Community Supported Agriculture 
(CSA) member pick-up happening 
in just a few hours. The Champion 
Family 
Farm’s 
CSA 
program 

allows community members to 
make an upfront investment in the 
farm in exchange for a bi-weekly 
share of the vegetables produced 
at the farm. Each member receives 
a crop box filled with in season, 
freshly harvested produce that 
varies with each pick-up. Today’s 
box includes a fragrant assortment 
of garlic scapes, green onions, 
shallots, kale, chard, strawberries, 
and lettuce mix. CSA share days 
are busy, as harvesting, dividing 

and distributing the produce are 
all tasks that must be completed in 
addition to the other daily chores. 
Kevin and Lindsay Champion have 
been working since dawn, but 
time is still of the essence. Empty 
crop-boxes are lined up in the pole 
barn while Lindsay, with the help 
of employee Mark Abrams, work 
quickly to divide and prepare the 
vegetables for the crop boxes. 

There are more CSA members at 

the farm this year, an increase that 
the Champion family attributes 
to changes related to the COVID-
19 pandemic. After seeing empty 
shelves in grocery stores amid 
panicked food shopping, many 
community 
members 
turned 

to local CSA programs as an 
alternative to big-box stores and 
unreliable 
commercial 
supply 

chains. The temporary closure of 
farmers markets and restaurants 
resulted in many small farms, 
including the Champion Family 
Farm, 
being 
forced 
to 
find 

alternative ways to distribute their 
produce. For many, this meant 
increasing the number of CSA 
memberships to make-up for what 
would normally be distributed 
at markets and restaurants. This 
pivot was successful for the 
Champion family, but according to 
Jae Gerhart, an MSU Food Systems 
Coordinator 
for 
Washtenaw 

County, was a struggle for others. 
“A lot of farms have sold too many 
shares and are struggling to supply 
all the members,” Gerhart said. 
“They just got excited by all the 
increased demand.”

Meanwhile, large scale farms 

have had their own struggles 
in relation to the pandemic, 
their size preventing them from 
adapting quickly to changes in 
supply chains. “They couldn’t 
shift as fast,” Gerhart said. “The 
system righted itself within two 
weeks, which is pretty fast, but it 
took all hands on deck.” Gerhart 
mentioned that some farms were 
forced to dump milk and overturn 
crops like onions and potatoes. 
Lindsay interjected in shock, “Oh, 
no! Storage crops!” The idea of 
turning over a storage crop like 
onions, that can cure in the field, 
is horrific to Lindsay, but the chaos 
that took place at industrial farms 
differed from the struggles of 
smaller, organic farms like hers. 
With her infant son strapped to 
her chest and her toddler kicking 

up dust in the driveway, Lindsay 
described some of the trouble 
they’ve had with pests and weather 
at the farm. The unpredictable 
challenges bring a certain level of 
risk for share members, as some 
pick-ups can be lighter than others 
as a result. Lindsay worries about 
ensuring produce distribution, but 
it is a risk that members are willing 
to take in exchange for fresh, in 
season vegetables. 

As 3 p.m. approaches, Kevin 

joins Lindsay in the pole barn with 
their teenage son and Mark to 
complete the distribution process. 
Hands are busy cutting down 
the ends of the green onions and 
counting out sweetpeas, while the 
toddler, Solstice, quality checks 
the strawberries by sampling a 
berry from each box. The team 
finishes just in time, the crop-
boxes packed and lined up neatly 
as cars start to pull up in front of 
the pole barn. The Champions 
take 
a 
well 
deserved 
break, 

sitting and greeting the members 
as they arrive for their share. 
Members make light conversation 
beneath their face masks, talking 
to Lindsay about the contents of 
this week’s box, recipe ideas and 
goings on at the farm. Some stay 
longer than others, chatting with 
each other and enjo ying the views 
of open fields and rows of crops in 
the distance. Lindsay explains to 
one of the members that she has 
the choice between kale and chard, 
since some boxes have one or the 
other. The woman is happy to take 
either, and ends up selecting the 
box with chard to try something 
new. 

The rush of the morning chores, 

preparation and initial pick ups 
slows as the day progresses. A 
late afternoon lull seems to have 
set in, but work continues despite 
the slower pace. Lindsay leaves 
the pole barn with the baby on 
her hip. She sits down on the edge 
of a crop field and starts weeding 
the outermost row. A member 
that has just arrives comes to join 
her, chatting and sitting down to 
help with the task. Kevin is busy 
cleaning out the pole barn to make 
room for the freshly baled hay to 
be stored. There are a few more 
shares waiting to be picked-up, 
but there’s no rush. The evening 
chores still loom, but no one seems 
to be thinking of those now as they 
enjoy the relief and temporary 
relaxation of another successfully 
completed share day.
