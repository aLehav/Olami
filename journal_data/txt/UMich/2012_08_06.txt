"real jazz" without overwhelming
listeners that may be hearing ele-
ments of modern jazz for the first
time.
Spalding believes that the radio.
is an extremely valuable tool to
expose listeners to new kinds of
music.
"The benefit of the radio is, some-
thing beyond your realm of knowl-
edge can surprise you, can enter
your realm of knowledge," Spald-
ing explained to NPR host Rachel
Martin. "Part of the premise of that
stems from my concern about the
accessibility ofjazz,justhow people
can access it. If you don't already
know about jazz music, how would
you be exposed? How would get an
opportunity to find out if it spoke to
you? If you get exposed to it enough,
you might find a taste for it."
This is the magic of Spalding's
music. Her recordings contain a
little bit of everything, yet it's vir-
tually impossible to pinpoint any
one genre at any given moment.
It's a futile effort to try to define
her recordings using traditional
musical labels. Spalding simply
makes music - thoughtful, delib-
erate, spirited music.

Perhaps the most intriguing
parts of Spalding's compositions
and arrangements are the quiet
moments: some sustained bass
notes, the light touch of a drum
stick on a cymbal, the whispers
of an organ. These moments give
the music some breathing room.
As listeners' minds float in this
nebulous space, they are able to
contemplate what they just heard
and wonder what will come next.
It'9 a far cry from the conventions
of mainstream popular music,
which has been characterized
by increasing volume, greater
homogenization and less variety,
according to a recent article pub-
lished in Scientific Reports.
The result of Spalding's efforts
is an organic musical experience
that has a powerful emotional
impact on all listeners, no matter
what genres of music they claim
to prefer. Spalding's musical tal-
ent is a force to be reckoned with
- yet her thoughtfulness, compas-
sion, optimism, appreciation for
a wide variety of musical styles
and desire to share the spotlight
are what set her apart from other
popular musicians today.

very distinctive, satisfying flavor.

For example, "Radio Music

Economist served five
presidents, had eight
honorary degrees
By JACOB AXELRAD
Editor in Chief
Paul McCracken, former chair-
man of the Council of Economic
Advisers under President Richard
Nixon and University Professor
Emeritus of business administra-
tion, died in Ann Arbor at the age
of 96 on Friday.
Upon graduating from Wil-

liam Penn University, McCracken
took a position teaching English
at Berea College in Kentucky. And
after obtaining a master's degree
in economics from Harvard Uni-
versity, he joined the Department
of Commerce' in 1943 where he
made the prediction that would
ultimately put him oncthe econom-
ic map.
While most economists
believed the post-World War II
economy would revert back to
Depression-era conditions in a
process known as "secular stagna-
tion," McCracken went against the
grain, predicting a surge in eco-

nomic growth that turned out to
be true, according to Sidney Jones,
a colleague of McCracken in both
the Nixon administration's coun-
cil of economic advisers and the
Ross School of Business.
"McCracken, as a remarkable
young man, made this correct
forecast, and it really made his
repitation," Jones said.
McCracken - an Edmund Ezra
Day Distinguished University
Professor Emeritus - came to the
Universityin 1947 where he taught
in the Business School while also
holding positions in Washington

PROFESSOR
From Page 1A
D.C., serving Presidents Eisenhow-
er, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and
Ford in a range of capacities.
With his jobs in government ser-
vice, a doctorate in economics and
a past that included business con-
sulting work for companies such as
Dow Chemical and General Motors,
McCracken implemented his varied
experiences in the classroom.
"He really had these three legs to
the stool, so when he would talk to
students he could tell them practi-
cal things," Jones said of McCrack-
en's teaching method.
Former colleagues and students
also lauded McCracken's passion
for teaching. Herb Hildebrandt,
University Professor Emeritus and
long-time friend and coworker
of McCracken's, said McCracken
would always make time to connect
to students and faculty even after.
retiring from the Business School.
"In his early nineties, he would
sit after lunch ... in the main room
of the Business School and whoever
came by - students, faculty - he
would speak with. He did that for
years," Hildebrandt said.
Hildebrandt added that
McCracken initially came to the
University for the scholarly oppor-
tunities and the desire to teach the
principles of economics and busi-
ness to students. McCracken was a
fixture at the Business School until

his death, receiving eight honorary
degrees in his lifetime, according to
the University News Service.
Though McCracken was a mem-
ber of the Business School faculty,
he was primarily an economist, spe-
cializing in "business, international,
national and world economics,"
Hildebrandt said. However, Hil-
debrandt added that due to conflict
between the Business School and the
economics department, McCracken
was never a member of the econom-
ics department at the University.
Hildebrandt told the News Ser-
vice that one-of his fondest memo-
ries of McCracken was his strong
emphasis on ethics.
"Paul lived a life of ethical ele-
gance," he said. "He stubbornly
believed that a fitting coda to one's
life should be that ethics and moral-
ity should walk hand in hand with
whatever one does. He taught me
many things, but most importantly,
he taught me humility."
Though McCracken considered
himself a moderate Republican, he
believed the government should
take an active role in the business
world, both in terms of regulation
and granting aid to the unemployed,
according to The New York Times.
McCracken based his model of
employing a strong governmental
role in the economy after economist
Milton Friedman of the University
of Chicago Department of Econom-
ics, according to the News Service.
In 1995, Friedman said McCrack-

en's work transcended economics,
adding thathe was a great academic
who influenced both sides of the
political spectrum.
"Paul McCracken has earned a
deservedly high reputation in three
different worlds: the academic, the
governmental and the business ...
few academics have achieved so
wide a range of influence," Fried-
man said.
And yet, Jones was also influ-
enced by the Keynesian school
of thought as a result of studying
under Alvin Hansen at Harvard,
known as "The American Keynes."
"He combined the two schools,
the Keynesianism and the (Chicago
School) Monetarism, and it made
him really quite unique," Jones said.
"Most economists of that era would
be either a Keynesian ... or they'd be
a monetarist ... but McCracken had
both capabilities, and that made
him quite unusual."
During the 1960s and '70s
McCracken attempted, albeit
unsuccessfully, to curb inflation,
according to The New York Times.
"Government was never during
the 1970s able to bring itself to meet
the first fundamental requirement
of a successful price-stabilization
policy - namely, that its policies,
quite simply, would not accommo-
date inflation," McCracken told The
New York Times in 1980.
After serving presidents Ken-
nedy and Johnson, McCracken was
asked by president-elect Nixon to

serve as chief economic adviser.
McCracken and Nixon disagreed
over the use of wage and price con-
trols, in seeking to stop inflation,
and this tension led to McCracken's
resignation from the economic
council in 197t. According to Jones,
McCracken was opposed to wage
and price controls, declared on Aug.
15,1971,yet refused to speak out and
didn't resign until December of that
year because of loyalty.
"I thought that was a very gentle-
manly thingto do, avery classything
to do," Jones said. "That was very
typical of what Paul McCracken is."
Despite leaving the council, he
continued to advise organizations
including the Academic Advisory
Board for the American Enterprise
Institute for Public Policy Research,
according to the News Service.
Business Prof. Alison Davis-
Blake said in a statement McCrack-
en will " be remembered for his
commitment to quality education
in addition to his economic accom-
plishments.
"I loved seeing Paul frequent our
building, long past his 'retirement."'
Davis-Blake said. "He seta wonder-
ful example for our current faculty
and students and is a testament to
the enduring legacy of education."
McCracken is survived by his
two daughters, Linda Langer and
Paula McCracken.

Retelling of classic
adds no depth to
original story
By DAVID TAO
SeniorArtsEditor
The old riff on Hollywood
remakes is that they're unoriginal,
soulless and formulaic. Take an old
classic, throw
in the. new gen-
eration's biggest
stars and hot- Total Recall
test storytelling
tropes, update At Quality16
the visual effects and Rave
and voila, you're
sitting on a buck- Columbia
et of money. Nine
times out of 10, the process yields a
visually appealing, yet utterly pre-
dictable movie, and "Total Recall"
is no exception. A mildly entertain-
ing but otherwise mediocre sci-fi
thriller, the film is a disservice to
its cult-classic predecessor.
From a broader perspective,
the remake and its source material
seem almost identical. Both are set
in futuristic dystopias and feature
a protagonist named Quaid (Colin
Farrell, "In Bruges"), a regular
working stiff, and a less-than-rep-
utable business known as Rekall, a
memory implant service that lets
you live out your fantasies. Quaid
visits Rekall, hoping for a quick
sojourn as a secret agent, but the
procedure fails, and he suddenly
finds himself plunged into a war
between the dystopia's dictator,
Cohaagen, and an underground
resistance movement.
But as per formula, the update
swaps out a few of the original's
cogs for newer doohickeys, tai-
lored for our generation. Writ-
ers Kurt Wimmer ("Salt") and
Mark Bomback ("Live Free or
Die Hard") eliminate the original
Martian setting, bowing instead
to Hollywood's recent fascination
with post-apocalyptic Earth. Gone
too are the original's references
to aliens, mutants and psychic
mysticism, in favor of the "gritty
realism" so in vogue with today's
crowd.
These little script tweaks won't
necessarily dooma remake, partic-
ularly if the changes are well-exe-
cuted, but director Len Wiseman

'U' regent corrects campaign finance error

Andrew Richner
responds to notice
of omission from
Secretary of State
By GIACOMO BOLOGNA
ManagingEditor
On Friday, University Regent
Andrew Richner (R-Grosse Pointe
Park) corrected a clerical error in
his election committee's 2010 and
2012 annual campaign statements
that had been outstanding since
February.
On Feb. 14, Richner's commit-
tee was sent a notice from the
Michigan Secretary of State that
explained that the committee's
beginning balance of its most
recent campaign statement did
not match the previous campaign
statement's ending balance.
The beginning balance was

listed as $22,451.07, but the previ-
ous statement's ending balancewas
$33,890.11 according to the notice.
The notice asked for amendments
to the statements "due in this office
no later than February 28, 2012"
and was sent again to the commit-
tee on May 24.
In a Thursday interview with
The Michigan Daily, Secretary of
State spokesman Fred Woodhams
verified that the committee "does
owe additional information to the
department."
"There are no fines for not fil-
ing or not responding to an error
of omission notice, but potentially
... if one is not received, it could be
referred to the Attorney General's
office," Woodhams said. However,
Woodhams added that bringing up
the issue with the Attorney Gener-
al does not necessarily mean there
would be prosecution.
Woodhams declined to com-
ment on the severity of the issue
and said the notice was simply in


need of a correction. -
"If you look at the error of omis-
sion notice, it's just looking for
some clarification on the dates and
adjusting it," he said.
In an interview with ,Richner
on Thursday, Richner said he was
unaware of any discrepancies in his
committee's campaign statements.
After taking a look at the notice,
which is publicly available online
through the Secretary of State
website, Richner said the omission
was an unintentional foible that he
intended to fix.
"It was clearly just a mistake,"
Richner said. "We do have to clear
that up. We'll do it right away."
One day later, the situation had
been corrected. In an interview
with the Daily on Friday, Richner
explained that the approximately
$10,000 discrepancy was a mis-
take.
"(It was) an expenditure that
was counted as a receipt twice
basically. It was double counted,"


he said. "That's why the balances
didn't jive."
The mistake, which required
changing the 2010 campaign state-
ment's endingbalance to $23,890.11
from $33,890.11, was partially the
fault of the software used to submit
the campaign statement, Richner
said.
"I think the software was
responsible for the mistake because
of the way that the data is entered
and it is misleading," Richner said.
"So I think it was an understand-
able mistake that my bookkeeper
made and we fixed it."
"I spent considerable time try-
ing to work through the software
glitch."
Richner said he was unaware of
attempts by the Secretary of State
to contact his committee.
In the end, the corrections to
the campaign statements resulted
in the 2012 campaign statement's
ending balance changing from
$22,115.07 to $23,554.11

Still a better love story than 'Twilight'.
("Underworld") never moves the
film beyond mediocre. Wiseman
is known for his films' ridiculous
action set pieces, but maintains
a surprisingly subdued tone
throughout "Recall." Farrell races
away from a new age robot police
force in his magnetic hovercar,
dodging bullets and crashing into
things, and for some reason, all of
it seems static. Nothing makes you
catch your breath or keeps you on
the edge of your seat; it's adequate,
but unspectacular.
Visually too, the film disap-
points. The original, directed by
Paul Verhoeven ("Basic Instinct")
had an incredibly distinctive, if
polarizing, visual style, blending
boxy, oversized early-90s pro-
duction design and Verhoeven's
quirky, polarizing penchant for
the blood-soaked and physically
demented. Those campy, color-
ful sets have been replaced with
flavorless, recycled-looking stock
designs, painted with a palette of
gunmetal grays and sterile whites
devoid of personality.
In short, Wiseman fails to bring
anything new to the table, while
simultaneously failing to under-
stand what made the original film
so legendary. Hint: It wasn't elabo-
rate special effects, or extended
chase sequences rife with gunfire,
or even the infamous triple-breast-
ed hooker Quaid meets midway
through the original film, which
Wiseman took extra special care
to include in his update. What gave
the original its staying power was
its ambition; it's willingness to
tackle questions of reality.

Throughout the original, Quaid
duels with his own perception;
did the Rekall procedure really
go wrong? Is what's happening to
him, actually happening to him? Or
should he listen to the people say-
ing he's suffered a psychotic break?
The script is carefully written so
that some scenes seem a little too
perfect, a bit too similar to the
vacation package Quaid ordered.
At the same time, we want Quaid's
new reality to be real, upping the
stakes considerably; we're tied to
our unremarkable lives, but maybe
our buddy Quaid can get out and
become something more. Wise-
man's retelling ignores all of these
questions in favor of a straight-.
forward, unexceptional effects-
driven chase, leading to an utterly
forgettable final product.

Vote Kailasapathy Petersen Teall
and Armentrout
Election day is tomorrow, and somewhat unfortunately so. Many students aren't in Ann Arbor for the summer, and
voter turnout is expected to be at a historic low. At first glance it might appear to be a dismal situation, but for those
of us who will be voting in Ann Arbor city council elections tomorrow, our votes may hold more power than we might
think.
Many students fail to recognize the importance of the Ann Arbor City Council. The University can be seen as completely
separate from the city of Ann Arbor. This is a great misconception that students and city council members alike must recognize
because relevant problems that students face everyday, such as off-campus housing prices and public transportation, have
more to do with the city than they do with the University. The Michigan Daily's endorsements represent the candidates we
feel best represent us as students and have the experience necessary to make their platforms a reality in City Council.

Daily Sports Writer
The start of the season is fast
approaching for the Michigan
women's soccer team, and for most-
of the Wolverines, their focus will
be transfixed solely on Aug. 17 and
the season-opening weekend.
But for sophomore midfielder
Christina Murillo, junior forward
Nkem Ezurike and junior defens-
man Shelina Zadorsky, their
minds, as well as their bodies, will
be somewhere else.
Japan, to be exact.
While Michigan opens up its
season with games against Ford-
ham and Pittsburgh in Ann Arbor,
Ezurike, Murillo and Zadorsky - a
trio that has started every contest
they've competed in during their
collegiate careers - will be half-
way around the world participat-
ing in the Under-20 FIFA World
Cup, whcih takes place from Aug.
19 to Sept. 8.
"They're very special players,"
said Michigan coach Greg Ryan.
The two juniors will lace up for
Canada while Murillo will com-
pete for Mexico.
"Playing with Canada is a huge
challenge, but obviously it's an
honor," Zadorsky said. "It will just
help us even more ... I think we'll
come back better. International
experience adds to you as an all-
around player."

Both Chidester and Taylor had

Though all three players will
likely play significant roles for
their squads in Japan, Ezurike
figures to make the biggest visible
contribution. The explosive for-
ward has been the driving force
for the Wolverines' offense ever
since she arrived on campus.
In 2010, she became just the
fifth freshman in the program's
history to lead her team in scoring
and ranks first all-time with 1.80
points per game.
Ryan expects her to be just as
dangerous in international play.
"Nkem is a great target player, a
great forward and a great scorer,"
Ryan said. "If you look over our
past two seasons and see who has
the most goals scored, it's Nkem.
She's a critical player for us and
she will be for Canada."
The two Canadians will depart
from Michigan this week to join

In Ward 1, Eric Sturgis and Sumi Kailasapathy are run-
ning for the vacant seat. Sturgis has an associate's degree
from Oakland Community College, is an Ann Arbor Huron
High School alum and has helped coach high-school tennis
programs. He also has a strong desire to engage the student
body. In an interview with The Michigan Daily in July, Stur-
gis said he would like to hold meetings on the University
campus to allow students to voice their concerns. However,
being young and a student is a catch-22 for Sturgis. While he
clearly places an importance on engaging college students,
he lacks the experience and education of his opponent.
Kailasapathy, an accountant at Ann Arbor's Edwards,
Ellis, Armstrong & Company, co-founded a women's shel-
ter for victims of sexual violence and fought for human
rights as a student at the University of Jaffna in Sri Lanka.
She also taught at Eastern Michigan University for 10
years. Kailasapathy told the Daily she feels her duty as a
city councilmember is to ask the right questions. She's
committed to supporting fiscal responsibility and basic
services. While both candidates are concerned about the
Wall Street parking garage and the Fuller Road train sta-
tion, The Michigan Daily endorses SUMI KAILASAPA-
THY but urges her to look at these two issues more closely
once in office, as they are extremely important to students.
In Ward 2, Sally Hart Petersen faces incumbent Tony
Derezinski (D-Ward 2). Derezinski, a former state senator
and attorney, was elected to council in 2008 and 2010. He
has the significant knowledge from serving our city in the

past. In 2010, he told the Daily that he wanted to increase
the number of bike lanes in the city and decrease the cost
of rent by instating "reasonable" height caps. However, nei-
ther of these have happened.
Petersen told the Daily she would use her past business
experience to measure and manage customer satisfaction.
She has been present at many city council meetings to
observe. Petersen said she has already e-mailed University
President Mary Sue Coleman and has set up meetings with
former-and current regents. She stresses the importance of
establishing a collaborative relationship with the Univer-
sity. Petersen also wants the University's new companies to
use downtown commercial space in Ann Arbor. The Michi-
gan Daily endorses SALLY HART PETERSEN for Ward
2 because of her ambition and willingness to collaborate
with the University.
In Ward 4, Jack Eaton is running against the incumbent
Margie Teall (D-Ward 4). Both candidates have impressive
backgrounds in their own respect. Teall has been a mem-
ber of City Council since 2002 and is a leader in environ-
mentalism.
Eaton attended the University and is now an attorney in
Ann Arbor. He is a strong supporter of public transit and
told the Daily that he wants to increase the AATA service
during evenings and on weekends. This service would be
very beneficial for students, as many don't have cars.
Though Eaton has been a leader in environmentalism
and led the effort to expand Ann Arbor's recycling pro-

gram, The Michigan Daily endorses MARGIE TEALL for
Ward 4 because of her extensive experience in city council.
She should, however, follow Eaton's plans and work direct-
ly with students.
In Ward 5, Vivienne Armentrout and Chuck Warpe-
hoski are running for the vacant seat. Armentrout is a
former college professor and has been involved in politics
as well as civic issues. She told the Daily she wants to re-
examine spending priorities. Armentrout said she supports
mass transit and wants Ann Arbor residents to be able to
get everywhere without a car but doesn't agree that a new
train station is needed on Fuller Road.
Chuck Warpehoski is the director of the local Interfaith
Council for Peace and Justice and serves on the AATA's dis-
trict advisory committee, along with Armentrout. Warpe-
hoski told the Daily he wants to provide better regional
service for transportation. He supports building a new
train station on Fuller Road. He also told the Daily he wants
to improve the quality of life for Ann Arbor residents, and
that includes making Ann Arbor a great place for the arts.
He wants to reevaluate the Percent for Art ordinance and
see if it's really benefiting the art scene the way it should.
While Warpehoski has a solid platform that addresses the
many aspects of Ann Arbor, The Michigan Daily endors-
es VIVIENNE ARMENTROUT for her experience and
sensible priorities, but urges her to re-examine her stance
against the train station on Fuller Road, or at the very least,
make improving the current train station a priority.

with a .325 average, with 17 RBIs
and 6 home runs coming off of 13
total hits - numbers similar to
her college career, where she was
a slugger in Michigan's batting
order.
And Taylor, Michigan's ace
from 2008-11, went 5-0 in her
eight games this summer, record-
ing 36 strikeouts in 24.2 innings
of work while giving up just five
earned runs for a 1.42 ERA.
Chidester and Taylor both will
have invitations to try out for next
summer's national team, as each
player on the current roster gets a
chance to try out again.
Taylor played in a Japanese
league for 2012 while Chidester

was finishing her career at Michi-
gan - where Chidester plans to
return as a volunteer to help dur-
ing her fifth year of school.
"I have another year left of
school, so I'll be at Michigan still,
just helping out with the team,
working out, staying in shape,
and getting ready for tryouts,"
Chidester said. "I have to take a
fifth year. I'm in physical educa-
tion, so I have to do a semester of
classes and do student teaching"
As for her work with the soft-
ball team?
"I'm going to be a student man-
ager, student assistant-type thing
where I'll be helping out at prac-
tice."

Michael Phelps: gold, but not maize

Noise at the polls

ALICIA KOVALCHECK

E-MAIL ALICIA AT ALIMARKO@UMICH.EDU.

As the 2012 Summer Olym-
pics approached, I had
the fun task of compiling
a list of the
Michigan ath-
letes that were
headed across
the pond to
compete.
So I checked
out MGoBlue.
com's roster of
all the Michi- COLLEEN
gan affiliates THOMAS
headed to
London and
found a list of 28 names complete
with their countries, events and
affiliation with the University in a
simple table on the website.

Copy, paste, add a brief bio and
publish the story, right?
Not so fast.
-While it's important to recog-
nize that Michigan coaches going
to London put in the same amount
of time and effort into training
their athletes, it's essential to
celebrate the athletic accomplish-
ments of the student-athletes who
will run, swim and vault in the
Summer Olympics instead.
That eliminates a number of
coaches, assistant or otherwise,
leaving a handful of names. And
I thought to myself, "I wonder if
the Michigan athletic community
embraces Michael Phelps as a
Michigan athlete, since he trained
in Ann Arbor for several years."

I scrolled down to the swim-
mers and saw Phelps' name on the
list. But beside his name was his
affiliation with the University:
a volunteer coach from 2005 to
2008, not 'varsity letterwinner.'
That nixed his name from my list.
True, Phelps came to Ann
Arbor to train with coach Bob
Bowman after Bowman was hired
as the men's swimming coach in
2004. True, Phelps did enroll in
classes at the University - but not
to pursue a degree - and served
as the volunteer coach while
training with Club Wolverine
under Bowman.
Phelps was a student, yes, but
not a student-athlete.
Phelps was never offered a
scholarship to Michigan, nor was
he ever recruited to swim for the
Wolverines. He never took to the
pool for a Big Ten meet, and he
never experienced the camara-
derie and teamwork that Peter.
Vanderkaay or Connor Jaeger felt
when they competed for national
titles in a Michigan swim cap.
So if Phelps was never actually

on the swim team despite being a
student, why should he be includ-
ed in the list of Michigan athletes
at the Olympics?
He shouldn't.
Many people and places -
including Bentley Historical
Library's page compiling the
entire list of Michigan athletes'
all-time Olympic appearances
- claim Phelps as a Wolverine,
citing his block 'M' tattoo on his
lower abdomen and his brief stint
taking classes in Ann Arbor as.
reasons why he should be a part
of the list.
It's almost like the Michigan
community is calling Phelps one
of its own just to boast the most
decorated Olympian ever as a fel-
low Wolverine. Because of that
slight connection, an average fan
or old alum can say they have a
connection to Phelps that every-
one else doesn't, and that Michi-
gan has the "leaders and best"
because Phelps is just like them
- a true Wolverine.
But Phelps wasn't among the
thousands of student-athletes

who put in innumerable hours
in the pool, not to mention the
countless hours sitting in the
Academic Center or the UGLi
doing homework. Those student-
athletes are not only training for
their Big Ten seasons, but also
working hard for a degree that
many of them will actually put to
use once their days as an athlete
are over.
I'm not trying to undermine
Phelps' athletic talent at all -
he is an exceptional athlete, no
doubt, and has achieved a feat
that will probably never come
close to being matched.
Phelps swam his way to 22
Olympic medals and countless
world records, but for the Michi-
gan fan base to claim him as one
of their own is unfair to the rest
of the true student-athletes that
don the maize and blue both in
the classroom and on the field.

It seems that one cannot walk
across campus without being
approached by someone who wants
to register
Michigan vot-
ers. I recently
heard somebody
tell the man
who was try-
ing to register
her that she did
not feel com-
fortable voting MATTHEW
because she feltZAK
too uninformed. ZABKA
The man then
tried to con-
vince her of how
very important it was for every sin-
gle eligible American to take advan-
tage of his or her right to vote.
Society seems to chide those who
are eligible to vote but choose not
to: P. Diddy's "Vote or Die" cam-
paign comes to mind, for example.
The stigma, however, is greatly
misplaced. The uninformed voter's
checkmark on a ballot doesn't serve
the republic, and society shouldn't
reproach uninformed non-voters.
Rather, the sigma should be against
being uninformed altogether.
In statistics, random variation
in a system - like random votes in
an election - is called "noise." This
term seems particularly appropri-
ate considering a growing percent-
age of us get our information from
biased shows, with people like Sean
Hannity or Bill Maher yelling about
how stupid they think the other
side is. The ever-louder blubbering
of these talking heads has led to
more statistical noise in elections.
The man who attempted to reg-
ister the woman directed her to a
website where she could inform
herself. His suggestion - and I am
not making this up - was President
Barack Obama's campaign website.
"Everything you need to know is
there." Yes, everything she needed
to know in order to vote exactly
how the guy wanted her to vote.
Informed voters examine issues
and support policies based on what
they think is best, but no voter
should support a policy only because
a particular candidate or political
party has adopted that policy. It's
scary to see how often a party can
take two completely opposite posi-
tions while-the party faithful hap-
pily contradict themselves.
Angry about the Iraq war, many
liberals cheered as then-Sen.
Obama declared, "The President
does not have power under the Con-
stitution to unilaterally authorize a
military attack in a'situation that
does not involve stopping an actual
or imminent threat to the nation."

After his election to the presidency,
Obamatunilaterally authorized mil-
itary attacks against Libya - and*
the same liberals then cheered!
Independent
voters are a
minority.
Not to be outdone, many conser-
vatives supported spending almost
$1 trillion to topple the dictator of an
oil-rich nation to protect civilians
while a Republican was in the White
House. The same.conservatives then
opposed spending $1 billion to top-
ple the dictator of an oil-rich nation
to protect civilians while a Demo-
crat was in the White House.
Neither the Democrats nor the
Republicans examined these issues
and made informed decisions.
Rather, they listened to their politi-
cal party's leaders and talk-show
hosts. When these leaders did a 180,
these voters followed them in lock-
step. I suppose living as one of these
party faithful would be pretty easy.
Why spend time informing yourself
when Messrs. Reid or Boehner will
tell you what to think?
Perhaps scariest is the fact that
independent thinkers are becoming
a smaller percentage of the voting
block. Some polls have indicated
that Obama and Mitt Romney are
fighting over the less than 10 per-
cent of voters who areundecided.
Meanwhile, according to Gallup,
the budget deficit is the second
most important issue in this elec-
tion. Neither Romney nor Obama
has presented a credible plan to
deal with these unsustainable defi-
cits, but incredibly 90 percent of
voters have made up their minds.
How depressing.
It is every American's right
to vote. There's a stigma in this
country against people who do not
exercise this right, but this makes
as much sense as chiding some-
body for not exercising his Second
Amendment rights. Americans
should instead be encouraged to
stay informed and make their own
decisions about what policies are
best. As to how to achieve this, have
you tried putting down the remote
and picking up a newspaper?

Chldester, Taylor finish
summer with Team USA


By COLLEEN THOMAS
Daily SportsEditor
After nine days of competi-
tive softball, silver medals hung
around the necks of former Michi-
gan softball players Amanda
Chidester and Jordan Taylor.
But not Olympic silver medals.
After the International Olym-
pic Committee voted to drop base-
ball and softball from the 2012
Olympic program in 2005, things
changed in the world of softball.
Instead of the Olympics being the
peak of a softball career, Chidester
and Taylor competed for gold at
the-International Softball Federa-
tion Women's World Champion-
ships.
From July 15-22 in Whitehorse,
Yukon, Team USA battled 15 other
teams for the world title - which
came down to just one inning.

Arguably the best two teams
in softball in the past few years,
Japan and the United States took
the championship game to 10
innings, with the Japanese team
knocking off the defending cham-
pion U.S. squad in a 2-1 final.
The U.S. had outscored its oppo-
nents by 11 points throughout the
tournament, but struggled a bit in
the playoffs. The U.S. scraped by
Canada, 4-2, and beat Japan in the
semifinals, but couldn't pull off
the win in the championship.
Chidester, though, wasn't wor-
ried about the loss - Japan had
beaten them in the championship
of the Canada Cup earlier in the
summer after the -U.S. had beat
them in a previous game.
"They're a really good team
and sometimes we have to look
at the bigger picture - we've
played together for a month, and

Japan's played together all year,"
Chidester said. "It's a really big
difference. We competed with
them the whole way, and we-did
very well."
Though most of the players
from the 2011 national team were
on the roster, giving some needed
experience to the young Ameri-
can squad, many collegiate play-
ers, like Chidester, made the team
after tryouts in June.
And even though players from
rival teams made it - Oklahoma's
Keilani Ricketts and Alabama's
Jackie Traina faced each other in
the Women's College World Series
Championship games - Chidester
said there was no bitterness
between teammates.
"One thing he'll never forget
is (USA Softball head coach Ken
Eriksen) saying that (he) didn't

councilelections after narrowlylos-
ing the Democratic primary race to
Hohnke in 2008.
Incumbent Tony Derezinski
(D-Ward 2) is defending his seat
against MBA-holding Democrat
Sally Hart Petersen. Margie Teall
(D-Ward 4) is up against Democrat
Jack Eaton, who ran against Teall
in the 2010 primary election. Chris-
topher Taylor (D-Ward 3) faces an
uncontested bid for re-election.
While this election is only the pri-
mary, three of the five council races

will essentially be decided as only
Democrats are running for those
positions. The only Republican run-
ning for a position on the council is
Stuart Berry in the 5th ward.
City Clerk Jacqueline Beaudry
said depending on their precinct,
students willvote in avariety ofloca-
tions around campus, including the
Michigan Union, Michigan League,
Pierpont Commons, Palmer Com-
mons and the University Coliseum.
However, Beaudry said low stu-
dent turnout is expected for the

summertime primary.
"Obviously we see historically
that the predominantly student
precincts have a lower turnout in
August" she said. "A lot of the stu-
dents are away for the summer."
Beaudry added that Ann Arbor's
expected turnout rate is 20 percent of
voters, but said the expected student
turnout would be lower than that.
"Some of the campus pre-
cincts will have very low turnout,"
Beaudry said.
Beaudry stressed that the polls

will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Tuesday and that voters need to
make sure they turn over their bal-
lots to have a say in each race.
"One thing we are trying to pro-
mote (is that) ... the council races
are often missed and youhave to flip
the ballot over and they're on the
backside," she said. "We're just try-
ing to, ahead of Tuesday, let people
know to make sure they vote --vote
both sides of the ballot."
The general election is on Nov. 7,
2012.

The Olympic Games are filled
with chemistry. Metaphorically
speaking, chemistry is felt both
on and off the playing field,
while literally the chemicals
used in different medicines help
athletes overcome pain and
injury. And let's not forget the
inorganic, metal-based chemis-
try displayed during the award
ceremonies. Medallions of gold,
silver and bronze (a copper-tin
alloy) are draped around the
necks of Olympic champions,
recognizing their achievement
on a global stage.
Chemistry, figuratively and
literally, plays a significant role
in the Olympic Games. How-
ever, "the goal of Olympism is
to place sports at the service of
the harmonious development of
humankind." The XXX Olym-
piad - which began on July
27 - exemplifies this mission
statement as athletes from 205
countries unite for 17 days of
global competition.
I didn't have to wait until
the Opening Ceremony in Lon-
don to feel th'is sense of unity.
Since June, I've been spending
my time in a different sort of
international community: the
chemistry laboratory. Under
Chemistry Prof. Melanie San-
ford, I've been working on my
honors thesis. Together the
undergraduates, graduate stu-
dents and postdoctoral fellows
who conduct research in San-
ford's lab represent nine nations
and three of the five continents
depicted by the Olympic rings.
United by our curiosity in
the chemical sciences, my lab-
mates and I speak two mutual
languages, English and chem-
istry. English is the second, or
even third, language spoken by
half my lab-mates, but by draw-
ing out reaction mechanisms,
we have the ability to transcend
language barriers. Nonethe-
less, it's still not uncommon to
walk into my lab and not always
understand the conversation at
hand.
While my German is limited
to a few phrases, my fluency in

the language of chemistry has
flourished during my research
experience. Working in a
multi-cultural environment
has allowed me to view chem-
istry from many different per-
spectives. We all approach our
research from diverse edu-
cational and personal back-
grounds. The exchange of ideas
from these distinct viewpoints
'enrich and broaden the path
toward the overall solution.
In the case of my thesis, these
questions deal with the devel-
opment of reactions used to
change carbon-hydrogen bonds
into carbon-carbon bonds using
palladium as a catalyst.
Working in this lab has not
only increased my knowledge
in the field of chemistry, but
provided me with the oppor-
tunity to learn about a diverse
range of cultures. Taking
advantage of my past Spanish
classes, I've been able to get to
know my Guatemalan lab-mate
through speaking all three of
the languages we share. Dif-
ferent aspects of our person-
alities and past knowledge
flourish depending on the lan-
guage we're using. Nine years
of studying Spanish, including
a semester abroad in Seville,
Spain, have provided me with
a solid understanding of the
language. My fluency and com-
fort level, however, continue to
improve during these shared
conversations.
Though the 2012 Summer
Olympic Games come to a
close on Aug. 12, the sense of
international unity promoted
by the Games will continue in
my everyday life. While I don't
compete for gold on a daily
basis, my research in palladi-
um-based chemistry allows me
to work with chemists from
around the globe. Chemistry,
like the Olympics, unites people
from all over the world and acts
as a catalyst for multicultural
exchange.

is a LSA junior.

The hardest part of studying
abroad is coming back home. Yes,
you read that right. It's not the cul-
ture shock of
entering a new
territory, the
time adjust-
ment or the
food. It's not
even the mys-
terious eight-
week illness
that continues CAITLIN
to wreak havoc MORATH
on my immune
system. Out of
all the adventures and mishaps I've
faced during my time abroad, the
biggest challenge has been return-
ing home.
For starters, let's focus on the
simple things. Jet lag is much eas-
ier to overcome heading to a for-
eign land with endless treasures
to seek out. While my first day in
Rome involved a castle, the Vatican,
an authentic Italian meal with 25
strangers and a moonlit trip to the
Trevi Fountain, my first day back in
Michigan started with a trip to the
doctor, followed by some quality
time with my couch, my dog and my
DVR. Needless to say, getting my
sleep schedule back on track was a
bit more difficult.
And then there's the food. I'll
admit it, even as the major foodie
I claim to be, after six weeks I was
ready for some good ol' American
cooking. Chicken tenders, pan-
cakes, French fries, ranch dressing,
milk shakes, hotdogs; I spent my
first few days back loading up on
the classics. And then it hit me -
"it" being a tremendous belly ache
Rebel with a cause
TO THE DAILY:


- and I remembered that this isn't
the food I normally eat. The string
of food seen in every McDonalds
commercial had somehow replaced
my usual fruits and veggies. Out
of all the changes I expected from
studying abroad, I never anticipat-
ed having to retrain myself how to
eat normally at home.
Despite hours of meetings, ori-
entation, prep work and endless
advice, the heads-up that coming
home can be difficult was never
brought up. And the immediate
symptoms that shock your sys-
tem upon re-entry aren't the only
adjustments that were never men-
tioned.
Being gone for as little as two
months made me realize just how
fast things can change. I expected
to have an earth-shattering experi-
ence in Italy, chock-full of enough
stories and memorable moments to
last a lifetime. What I didn't antici-
pate was just how much would
change back at home while I was
away.
I expected to come back home
and fall into the same routine, but
I took for granted the fact that all
the people I interact with have
lives too. I had fallen far behind
on the news and gossip concerning
my loved ones. Moreover, I found
myself in the odd position of hav-
ing to schedule appointments with
my friends and family in order to
catch up because their routine had
readjusted in the time I was away.
The problem is, while they had all
found new and productive ways to
fill their time, I was dramatically
separated from the people who I
shared everything with for the past

from the moment you step back
onto American soil). No one ,men-
tions how lonely it can be to sepa-
rate yourself from the people that
you've spent every minute of every
day with for weeks on end. I expect-
ed to love returning to the privacy
and serenity of my own home, but
that feeling was overwhelmed by
how much I missed being able to
walk down the hall and find some-
one to hang out with at any time of
day, or the security of always hav-
ing someone ready to grab dinner or
go shopping.
No one mentions
the challenges of
coming home.
