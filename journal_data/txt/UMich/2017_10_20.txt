University 
of 
Michigan 

hockey players will suit up 
Friday evening for the first 
time on the newly coined 
Red Berenson Ice Rink. The 
University’s Board of Regents 
voted unanimously Thursday to 
name the rink at Yost Ice Arena 
after Berenson, who served as 
the team’s coach for 33 seasons 
and retired this summer.

The rink will feature his 

signature through the end of 
the calendar year, while center 
ice will change to display 
Berenson’s name next year. 
The Board and other executive 
officers 
gave 
Berenson 
a 

standing ovation at the meeting.

“Going to Michigan was 

the best four years of my life,” 
he said. “I have spent the past 
33 years trying to help others 
achieve their dreams.”

The 
Board 
met 
at 
the 

University 
of 
Michigan 
at 

Flint, and executive officers 
spent the day in briefings 
on the state of the campus. 
Aside from brief comments by 
U-M Flint Chancellor Susan 
Borrego at the beginning of the 
meeting, the lingering water 
crisis did not figure heavily into 
the agenda. Robert Barnett, 
dean of the U-M Flint School 
of 
Education, 
presented 
a 

program to launch soon that 
will train Flint high schoolers 
to be certified early childhood 
educators by their high school 

graduation.
Endowment rises by 13.8 
percent

The University’s long-term 

investment profile grew by 13.8 
percent in the 2017 fiscal year 
to total $10.9 billion, up from 
$9.7 billion last year. After a 
dip last year Vice President of 
Development Jerry May said 
positive returns on investments 
and the Victors for Michigan 
Campaign contributed to the 

push.

The 
fund’s 
performance 

this year places the University 
ninth among all universities 
and colleges in the country, 
and the third highest public 
school system — after those 
of California and Virginia, as 
confirmed in a press release. 

University Spokesman Rick 

Fitzgerald 
noted, 
however, 

the endowment lags behind 
private institutions on a per-

student basis, ranking 86th in 
the nation.

“(The 
University’s 

endowment is) much smaller 
than many private school peers, 
while supporting a much larger 
number of students,” he wrote 
in an email.

Distributions to the general 

fund grew by $21 million to 
$325 million in the fiscal year. 
May pointed to Victors for 

The 
HERCULES 
laser, 
a 

scientific instrument used to 
study 
particle 
physics 
that’s 

housed in the University of 
Michigan’s Center for Ultrafast 
Optical Science, is getting a 
power upgrade after receiving 
a $2 million donation from the 
National 
Science 
Foundation. 

HERCULES currently holds the 
Guinness World Record for being 
the highest intensity focused 
laser, but this upgrade provides 
even 
more 
opportunity 
for 

advancement.

The laser can utilize this power 

for only fractions of a second, 
but the scale of this power is 
immense. To give the power 
a frame of reference, Anatoly 
Maksimchuk, a research scientist 
in CUOS, compared the laser’s 
power to all power available in the 
United States’ grid.

“The whole grid of the United 

States is only one terawatt,” 
Maksimchuk said. “With our 
laser, in one room, you have 300 
terawatts. So compared to the 
whole grid of the U.S., it is 300 
times more just in a single room.”

student was attacked and beaten 
outside of East Quad Residence

student, who wishes to remain

injuries including a concussion 
and a broken nose after the 
attack, but has since returned to 
school.

The student’s father, who also 

asked to remain anonymous 
while the incident is under 
investigation, said his son was 
standing with a group of friends 
outside East Quad that afternoon. 
Earlier in the day, a group of men 
had allegedly harassed a certain 
member of his son’s group who 
did not attend the University. The 
men returned later and a physical 
altercation broke out between 
the two groups. According to 
the father, one of the attackers 
blindsided his son and the fight 
became focused on him.

Though any game day in Ann 

Arbor is bound to witness its 
fair share of police activity, the 
game against Michigan State 
University on Oct. 7 — the first 
night game since 2014, and 
against one of the University 
of Michigan’s biggest rivals — 
was certain to see more. Still, 
several arrests and citations 
made at tailgates hosted by Black 
and Latino fraternities have 
members objecting to the lack 
of communication they have 
with police — and aggressive 
tactics therein — as compared 
to older, predominantly white 
fraternities.

There 
were 
at 
least 
six 

citations given out at the houses 
associated with Kappa Alpha Psi, 
a historically Black fraternity, 
and Latino fraternity Lambda 
Theta Phi house. At least two of 
the citations involved arrests, 
according to Ann Arbor Police 
Department 
reports 
of 
the 

incident retrieved by a Freedom 

of Information Act request. The 
citations were for disturbing 
public 
peace, 
creating 
a 

nuisance, obstructing police and 
contributing to noise.

All 10 predominantly white 

fraternities surveyed by the Daily 
reported no police presence 
or citations at house tailgates 
hosted Oct. 7.

According to the police report, 

officers were alerted to the party 
by a text from a student.

“(Reporting party) GOT A 

TEXT FROM A STUDENT 
REF A LARGE CROWD IFO 
(in front of) THIS HOUSE. RP 
IS NOT ON SCENE; STUDENT 
SHE GOT A TEXT FROM IS A 
PASSERBY,” the report read.

Police reported there were 

approximately 
1,000 
people 

blocking the street in front of 
the Lambda Theta Phi house 
when they arrived. They then 
encountered one of the hosts 
of the party, who told them his 
party had gotten out of hand and 
he couldn’t clear people out, and 
he was subsequently cited with 
disturbance of public peace.

Management companies evade Ann Arbor ordinance 
with leasing reservations, early deposits and signings

Upon arriving an hour and a half 

before the Prime Student Housing 
office opened Monday, Engineering 
junior Henry Burns was greeted by 
a sprawling line of almost 40 people 
who had beat him in his efforts to 
reserve an apartment.

The long line so far in advance 

of the office’s opening was the first 

indication of some off-campus 
properties attempting to navigate 
city ordinances to beat out their 
competitors.

“This is the first day that you 

could reserve a spot for signing a 
lease because leases aren’t allowed 
to be signed until November 10,” 
Burns said at the leasing office. “A 
lot of places get around it by having 
you sign a reservation earlier than 
that actual sign date, and this is the 
first day you’re allowed to sign a 
reservation and their office opened 
at 9 so people started getting 
here several hours beforehand. 
I heard people camped out and 

everything.”

Students who were already 

residents of Prime Student Housing 
were allowed to place new deposits 
as early as Oct. 13 and have the 
opportunity to renew a current 
lease up until 5 p.m. on Friday — 
afterward the market will open for 
anyone to sign for the apartment.

However, the office opened 

to the general public for deposits 
four days early on Monday. Only 
after deposits were placed would 
students be allowed to view 
their prospective apartments or 
residences, unless they had the 
chance to see the apartment of their 
own accord.

Some currently-leasing students 

received an email regarding the 
deposit opportunity with Prime 
on Monday, while others did not. 
Those who did not receive the 
email were informed of this date 
because they called the office 
prior to Monday, also of their own 
volition.

According to Business freshman 

Adya Pandey, Prime residences are 
in high demand due to their many 
different locations and relatively 
inexpensive pricing.

“I know that they have 20 other 

properties so it’s really popular and 
it’s really competitive because it’s 
cheap,” Pandey said.

A majority of students who 

planned to lease through Prime 
began waiting in line as early as 
2 a.m., though many cited a few 
students who were waiting since 10 
p.m. the night before.

During her three hour wait in 

line at the Prime Student Housing 
office, 
LSA 
freshman 
Rachel 

Westrick 
expressed 
confusion 

about Prime’s policies and the dates 
that students could place deposits.

“We called a while ago and they 

told us that the 23rd was the day 
that all the renewals were due, 
so that was the day that everyone 
would come,” Westrick said. “But 
then my mom checked a while back 
and they said you could just drop 
off a deposit whenever you wanted, 
to reserve a spot. So we came today 
and so I guess there was a line today. 
I don’t really understand that.”

Those who waited overnight at 

Prime to place a deposit were not 
all guaranteed housing; many — 
when finally through the door —

In an effort to increase 

inclusivity 
in 
University 

Residence 
Halls, 
the 
South 

Quad Residence Hall’s Afro-
American Lounge is now open 
to all South Quad residents. 
Prior to this announcement, 
residents were required to take 
an orientation on the lounge’s 
history and rules associated with 
the multicultural lounge to gain 
access to the space.

The Afro-American Lounge 

was established in 1972 following 
the rise of the Black Action 
Movement at the University 
of Michigan. The murals in 
the lounge represent African-
American history and celebrate 
African-American 
culture 
in 

a University setting. Before 
BAM pushed for the space, no 
other 
cultural 
organization 

had proposed a living space to 

meet and reflect on their shared 
experiences.

Before this decision, the Afro-

American Lounge orientation 
involved an overview of the 
lounge’s history, the significance 
of the artwork featured and a 
summary of the safety rules 
included in the lounge. Effective 
immediately, all students in 
South Quad now have access to 
the lounge for studying.

Currently, 
there 
are 
18 

Multicultural 
and 
Minority 

Culture Lounges in University 
Residence Halls but only a few 
require an orientation to access 
the space. 

In a release to South Quad 

residents, Hall Director Dan 
Green wrote the lounge should 
be a space to share ideas openly 
as a part of the tradition the 
lounges represent.

“Today 
the 
lounges 
are 

havens of support, solidarity, and 
sharing among residents,” Green 
wrote. “We encourage you to be 

a part of the amazing legacy of 
these lounges by collaborating 
with fellow residents, studying 
in the space, or participating in 
programs.”

Amir Baghdadchi, University 

Housing 
Public 
Relations 

spokesman, said not enough 
people 
were 
taking 
the 

orientation to gain access to the 
lounge, and without students 
using the space, the space was 
not accomplishing its mission.

“These spaces were always 

meant to be inclusive safe spaces,” 
Baghdadchi said. “Having more 
students being able to use them, 
to enjoy them, to interact with 
the art that’s in them, that can 
only be a good thing. It’s opening 
up access which is what the goal 
of inclusion is. We can’t make the 
space more inclusive by having 
fewer people use it.”

Rules for the lounge include 

leaving the room how you found 
it, not propping the door open 
and sharing the space so it’s open 
and collaborative. To make 
sure these rules are followed 
and 
collaborative 
space 
is 

maintained, 
according 
to 

Baghdadchi, Housing will create 
a new student position to look 
after the multicultural spaces 
and create new programming 
that will put emphasis on 
the character of the lounge. 
Baghdadchi also confirmed all 
Minority Lounges on campus 
that required an orientation will 
be open to residents. 

LSA sophomore Adrianna 

Ackerman, 
Community 

Relations Chair of the Ambatana 
Multicultural Council in South 
Quad, said many of the topics 
covered 
in 
the 
orientation 

are currently expressed on 
paper posters in the room. 
She said the Council has been 
discussing the installation of 
plaques in the room to preserve 
the educational aspect of the 
orientation.

Residence hall multicultural lounges 
open without necessity of training

Housing Public Relations says this is to make the spaces more inclusive, used

Every Friday, The Michigan 
Daily will be republishing an 
article from the Daily’s archives 
from a moment in University 
history. 

October 25, 1974 
— One 

of the most massive dope 
smuggling operations in Ann 
Arbor history was exposed 
Wednesday when federal 
indictments were brought 
against ten persons, including 
three local men, on charges 
they smuggled a two and a half 
ton truckload of marijuana 
from Mexico to Ann Arbor in 
early April 1973. The value of 
the grass on the retail “market” 
was estimated by police to 
approach one million dollars.

Steven Burns, Paul Morigi 

and Mary Hyman, all identified 
as Ann Arbor residents, were 
named by a Chicago federal 
grand jury in a four-count 

indictment. The charges 
are conspiracy to distribute 
marijuana, possession of 
marijuana and interstate travel 
to sell controlled substances.

Also charged are five 

Mexicans, a Chicagoan, and 
another as-yet unidentified 
person. Three of the suspects, 
including Hyman, are presently 
in custody, and federal agents 
said the rest are being sought.

While details of the 

operation are still incomplete, 
federal agents said yesterday 
that the marijuana apparently 
traveled in the following 
fashion:

From fields south of 

Reynosa, Mexico, it was 
smuggled across the border to 
McAllen, Texas. In McAllen, 
the grass was loaded onto a 
semi-trailer truck owned by 
one of the defendants, and then 
driven to Chicago. 

On Chicago’s south side, the 

marijuana, or all but a small 
part of it, was transferred to a 
Hertz rent-a-truck for shipment 
to Ann Arbor. Agents said the 
grass reached this city on about 
April 10, 1973. 

Asked how the case was 

broken, a federal agent in 
Chicago said “we have some 
information from informants, 
and extensive investigation 
into the case corroborated that 
information.”

The agent, who asked not to 

be identified, said a customs 
raid in Chicago that uncovered

five pounds of the grass 

shortly after the bulk of the 
marijuana was shipped to Ann 
Arbor, was instrumental in 
breaking the case.

Both federal and local police 

said that two of the Ann Arbor 
men had no prior reputations 
or records to point to their 

involvement in the massive 
smuggling. Hyman was the 
only local suspect to have a 
prior conviction, concerning a 
marijuana possession charge 
several years ago. He was given 
probation. 

One of the other suspects, 

Roosevelt Gandaria, was 
arrested a few days ago in 
Mexico, and charged with 
possession of twenty-two 
pounds of marijuana, an agent 
said.

Investigators are continuing 

their probe into the affair to see 
if other large scale shipments 
took Place, but city police chief 
Welter Krasny said that the 
April 1973 run was “probably 
the biggie.”

FRIDAY’S BICENTENNIAL FEATURE: MEMBERS OF LOCAL DOPE RING INDICTED

were told their priority apartments 
were already in high-demand and 
to select another apartment, with 
minimal help. Students said they 
were not told which apartments 
were available, as the management 
company didn’t know. Others 
put down their deposit without 
knowing the repercussions if their 
desired residences would be filled 
by other tenants.

While waiting in line at the 

Prime Student Housing office 
for three and a half hours, LSA 
sophomore Kathryn Qin decided to 
find out if others were experiencing 
the same wait times as her.

“While I was in this line I 

actually called a different housing 
place, and apparently there was no 
line for that,” Qin said.

Monday’s line is just one example 

of problems students experience 
with Ann Arbor housing. While 
affordability and vicinity are key 
issues many lessors have attempted 
to tackle, students are also voicing 
concerns over what they call a non-
transparent system.

Ann 
Arbor 
law 
prohibits 

leasing to occur until 70 days after 
the current lease period begins, 
meaning that students have only 
70 days to decide if they want to 
renew their lease for the upcoming 
year. The time period between the 
date Prime tenants could move in 
— according to the website, Aug. 25 
at the earliest, with an early move-
in cost of $600 — and the renewal 
date of Oct. 20, is only 56 days, not 
70.

Per Prime Student Housing, 

students could make appointments 
to view apartments or residences 
starting Oct. 23 — though the 
appointments would begin Oct. 27. 

Prime uses what they describe 

as “Option to Sign Deposits,” which 
allow students to lock down an 
apartment before the mandatory 
waiting period is over. Prime says 

that “Option to Sign Deposits” are 
for students who have already have 
seen the apartments on their own 
time, without an official tour from 
Prime itself. Students recalled their 
experiences knocking on doors 
and asking residents to see their 
current apartments or houses.

Prime’s 
“Option 
to 
Sign 

Deposits” bypasses Ann Arbor law 
by allowing students to reserve an 
apartment before the mandatory 
70-day waiting period is over and 
without receiving a tour of the 
apartment that they are placing a 
deposit on.

Prime has noted its commitment 

to this law; on its website, the 
company states: “We cannot begin 
to show apartments until the 
mandatory time frame has passed.”

However, after several phone 

calls, 
Prime 
Student 
Housing 

Property Manager Annette Temple 
declined to comment for any 
portion of this report.

The 
Ann 
Arbor 
Housing 

Commission could not speak to 
this law due to being a Housing 
and Urban Development fund 
administrator. 

The City Attorney’s office also 

did not respond for comment at the 
time of publication.

In 
comparison 
to 
other 

properties on campus — such as 
Cappo Management and Deinco 
Properties, Campus Management, 
Cabrio Properties and high-rises 
like Landmark — Prime is not 
completely unique.

For Cappo/Deinco Properties, 

though reservations are accepted 
Oct. 2 through Nov. 8 — similar to 
Prime — the company’s website 
explicitly states: “Leasing for Fall 
2018-2019 does not begin until 
Nov. 10, 2017. … If current tenants 
renew, then fee is returned. If 
reservationists cancel or do not 
show up on 11/10 to sign the lease 
then reservation fee is forfeited. 
If the lease is signed then the 
$500 becomes part of the security 
deposit.”

This information — that the 

soonest the company can show 
properties 
or 
sign 
leases 
is 

November, but reservations can 
be taken as early as October — is 
also repeated on the automated 
message when calling the office. 
The overlap of a deadline to renew 
a lease and the time to sign a new 
lease, however, is not as stark as 
with Prime.

Further leasing difficulties can 

be found at Campus Management 
properties. The company utilizes a 
first come, first serve policy when 
it comes to applications for houses 
and apartments and states on 
their website that — in reference 
to this policy — “Unfortunately, in 
our fast paced rental market this 
does occasionally create footraces 
between groups vying to get back 
to our office first.”

Campus 
Management 
also 

charges a fee that equates to half 
a month of rent if an applicant 
decides 
to 
withdraw 
their 

application. The company explains 
this fee is necessary due to the 
lost time created by a withdrawn 
application. Campus Management 
did not respond for comment by the 
time of publication.

Unlike Prime and properties 

that operate similarly, Cribspot 
properties do not attempt to bypass 
this law and instead enforce the 
mandatory 70-day waiting period 
to sign leases and even to place 
deposits.

According 
to 
LSA 
junior 

Merissa Maccani, a future Cribspot 
resident, her group of roommates 
has not been able to sign the lease 
or place a deposit for their new 
residence yet because the current 
residents still have time within 
their 70-day window to decide if 
they wish to renew their old lease.

“We are waiting for a verbal no 

from the group of people that are 
currently living there,” Meccani 
said.

Similar to Cribspot, Oxford 

Companies 
allows 
current 

residents first right to renew until 
Nov. 8, according to the company’s 

website — just over three weeks past 
Prime’s current tenant deadline. 
The Oxford website also explicitly 
spells out the leasing and renewing 
process; residents can apply online 
and pay $200 per applicant — 
which is split $100 towards the 
application and $100 towards a 
security deposit. Once applications 
are received, an electronic lease is 
sent out and future residents have 
three business days to sign it. Once 
it is signed, “future residents will 
have 3 additional business days to 
pay the remainder of the security 
deposit, which is equal to 1.5X the 
monthly rent, minus the $100 you 
paid upon applying.” After this, a 
manager confirms the lease.

Olivia 
Zuver, 
property 

management and leasing assistant 
for the residential team at Oxford 
Companies, said the company’s 
move-in dates are slightly later, 
requiring them to apply the 70-day 
ordinance even if it moves the 
renewal date later in the season, 
than other properties.

“To give the proper amount 

of time, 70 days, that’s why we’re 
giving them to November 8,” Zuver 
said. “Then, starting November 
9, is when we’ll officially start 
touring and signing leases for new 
residents.”

Prior to the renewal date, 

residents can place a reservation 
in a similar fashion as the official 
application.

“We have reservations coming 

through basically every day for 
places,” 
Zuver 
said. 
“They’re 

applying, 
putting 
down 
an 

application 
(and) 
their 
fees, 

signing a lease and paying the 
security deposit — we’re just not 
countersigning that lease until 
November 9. If somebody were 
to put down a reservation on an 
apartment, and then the current 
residents decide that they are 
renewing, we can transfer that to 
a different apartment or house that 
we have available or we refund 
them all the money they’ve put 
down.”

Students say this process is 

substantially more straightforward 
than 
Prime’s; 
however, 
with 

disparities apparent in nearly 
every 
management 
company 

in Ann Arbor, many students 
feel frustrated with the lack of 
transparency.

LSA junior Rebecca Deitch, an 

Oxford tenant, said she had to do 
her own property tours prior to 
signing with the company.

“Me and my roommates went 

around the area that we wanted 
to live and knocked on doors and 
found out who was moving out,” 
Deitch said. “Also, looked online, 
but it was just more reliable to ask 
in person.”

Once 
they 
decided 
on 
a 

property, 
the 
roommates 
put 

down a reservation prior to the 
renewal date; while this process 
was informative, Deitch noted an 
overall lack of communication and 
unreliability within the company 
before signing.

The 
application 
process 

through Landmark — one of Ann 
Arbor’s luxury high rises — is also 
inconsistent with that of the others. 
Along with Landmark’s application, 
several fees must be submitted: a 
$100 non-refundable application 
fee, a $100 non-refundable move-in 
fee, a $100 non-refundable hassle-
free fee and a refundable security 
deposit of $200.

Even 
on 
the 
application, 

Landmark has made it clear: 
“Accommodations 
are 
limited 

and will be leased on a first-come, 
first-served basis. The acceptance 
of (the) application does not 
ensure an accommodation. An 
accommodation 
is 
reserved 

only upon execution of the lease 
agreement by all parties.”

On 
the 
other 
hand, 
LSA 

freshman Sarah Renberg has had a 
different experience with another 
high rise.

Renberg — who is planning 

to sign a lease with three other 
roommates to live in Zaragon West 
next fall — spoke positively about 

her experience with the company.

Renberg said she found having 

four students live in a two-
bedroom Zaragon West apartment 
substantially 
cheaper 
than 

most houses around campus — 
despite often considered a luxury 
complexwas.

Luckily, Renberg said she and 

one of her roommates both have 
the advantage of older siblings on 
campus to forewarn them of the 
difficulty of finding housing later 
on in the semester.

“We 
heard 
if 
you 
left 

Thanksgiving break without a 
lease, then you probably wouldn’t 
find one,” Renberg said. “We’re all 
freshmen, so that was intimidating 
and overwhelming. We started 
hearing that people were already 
signing for apartments and that 
those fill up pretty fast, so we tried 
to move as quickly as possible.”

Renberg and her roommates 

were able to set up tours in a few 
complexes and were able to see 
“model” 
apartments 
prior 
to 

filling out any paperwork. Once 
the roommates submitted the 
housing application — which they 
completed before fall break so their 
spot was held — a lease was sent to 
the group, which they had five days 
to sign.

Renberg voiced concern with 

other management companies and 
the inability to see most apartments 
before placing a deposit.

“I’m not going to pay for 

something I’ve never seen before. 
I think there’s a lot of risk in that, 
and I didn’t want to rely on just the 
pictures online,” Renberg said.

However, Renberg was overall 

happy with her experience, though 
she found it challenging and 
rushed.

“We didn’t want to wait and 

chance it,” Renberg said. “I’ve only 
known these people that I’ll be 
living with for six or seven weeks, 
and now I’m deciding to live with 
them again. So it’s definitely an 
accelerated process, but that’s just 
the way it is.”

After 
the 
attackers 
left, 

Nursing student Danny Vachon 
saw the injured student on the 
ground bleeding profusely from 
his nose. He said the student’s 
friend was wearing a New 
England Patriots jersey and the 
father said the fight broke out 
over a sports argument. Vachon 
said the injured student and his 
friends were clearly intoxicated 
and he had to hold the student’s 
head up so he didn’t choke on his 
own blood. A bystander attempted 
to call 911 for the student but, as 
they didn’t know enough about 
his condition, Vachon called the 
Ann Arbor Police Department 
and was eventually referred to 
the University Division of Public 
Safety and Security.

DPSS 
spokeswoman 
could 

not comment on the case but 
confirmed the details of the 
incident.

The father, referencing the 

large crowds typical of a football 
game day, thinks there may 
be evidence of the assault on a 
bystanders’ phone. Existence of 
a video of the fight is unknown, 
but he believes there is a high 

probability someone has some 
sort of documentation on their 
phone. He is offering a $10,000 
reward 
on 
a 
University 
of 

Michigan 
Parents 
Facebook 

group for anyone with concrete 
evidence as to who attacked his 
son.

“The first thing is, (my son) 

gets attacked by these animals, 
when it’s six-on-one or eight-
on-one, even the biggest player 
on the football team is not going 
to be able to survive, but what’s 
just as frustrating is there’s cell 
phone video out there because 
there were people all over the 
place,” the father said. “(DPSS) 
has not been able to get any sort 
of video from the circumstance 
itself whether it was from the 
buildings or whether it was from 
bystanders and my opinion is 
nobody wants to step forward 
because nobody wants to be a 
rat.”

If it weren’t for Vachon, 

according to the father, the victim 
could have died by choking on his 
blood. Vachon said, as a nursing 
student with medical knowledge 
and background, he felt as 
though it was his duty to put his 
education to work and help.

“If it seems as though someone 

could be severely injured, if it 

looks like the average person’s 
help or knowledge wouldn’t 
really be something that would 
be valuable to that situation … it’s 
where actual medical knowledge 
and treatment would be probably 
necessitated is the point where 
I would feel like I would have to 
step in,” Vachon said. “A normal 
fight, I probably would have kept 
walking but something like this, 
I kind of felt the need to … step in 
and help.”

AAPD took the initial report 

and 
has 
since 
shared 
the 

investigation with DPSS.

Vachon said he was glad he 

didn’t walk past the victim, 
assuming him to be simply 
intoxicated.

“If this would have been a 

situation where, let’s say, I didn’t 
see him get into the fight and 
there’s just someone lying on 
the ground, sometimes you have 
that passing thought of, ‘Oh it’s 
just some drunk person that fell 
asleep and they’re on the ground 
and OK,” Vachon said. “If no 
one had been around to see this 
happen and if he had lied there 
for an hour or two, he probably 
would have died. … I’m just happy 
that I was there, that I was able to 
help him and I’m happy he’s OK 
right now.”

With the upgrade, HERCULES 

researchers hope to bump up 
the power to two to three times 
its current capacity — to 500 or 
1,000 terawatts. To do this, they’ll 
replace outdated lasers, some of 
which are homemade. The laser 
industry has progressed since the 
time of these homemade lasers, 
and researchers can now order 
more advanced versions. With 
this new equipment, HERCULES 
can reach new heights of power 
and intensity.

Assistant 
EECS 
professor 

Louise Willingale specializes in 
performing 
experiments 
with 

the HERCULES laser. She looks 
forward to the new experimental 
opportunities 
the 
upgrade 

provides.

“We’re hoping that with the 

upgrade we’ll be able to design 
new experiments that weren’t 
possible before,” Willingale said.

One new experiment they will 

attempt is called “boiling the 
vacuum.” When a laser reaches 
an extremely high intensity and 
encounters a single electron, 
the two can collide in such a 
way that they’ll create particles 

out of nothing. The upgraded 
HERCULES is expected to mimic 
this environment so researchers 
will be able to better study this 
phenomenon.

HERCULES will also make 

exciting new ventures in particle 
acceleration — a process that 
propels particles to faster speeds. 
Alexander 
Thomas, 
associate 

professor of nuclear engineering 
and 
radiological 
sciences, 

compared this process to wave 
surfing.

“Replace the boat with a laser 

pulse, which pushes through 
plasma, which is like the water, 
and the electron beam is the 
person gaining energy, being 
dragged in by the wave,” Thomas 
said.

Particle accelerators can be 

hundreds of yards long, but the 
HERCULES laser can accomplish 
the same job in a few yards or less.

“You’re reducing something 

that’s 
three 
miles 
long 
to 

something that can fit on a tabletop 
that impacts all of science, and 
that’s pretty exciting,” he said.

Increasing the energy and 

intensity of the laser is only 
one feature of the upgrade. 
Thomas 
discussed 
another 

area of improvement: a higher 
repetition rate, which allows 

the laser to shoot out pulses 
more 
frequently. 
Originally, 

researchers would have to wait 
about a minute between the trials 
of their experiments. The laser’s 
new technology will shorten this 
waiting time and allow for more 
repetitions.

“In 
terms 
of 
experiment 

techniques, it opens up much 
more,” he said.

Rackham 
student 
Amina 

Hussein, a graduate research 
assistant 
in 
the 
College 
of 

Engineering, has been working 
with HERCULES for two years. 
She discussed how incredible it is 
to have the opportunity to operate 
the laser herself.

“Getting an upgrade in a 

group like this where we work 
as collaborators who use the 
system and also get to take some 
ownership of the chambers is 
a really cool opportunity that I 
think is unparalleled in other 
groups that might have similar 
systems,” Hussein said.

She is excited for what the 

upgrade will permit HERCULES 
to accomplish.

“It’ll just allow us to continue 

pushing the envelope and do 
cutting edge science with these 
laser systems that are rare in the 
world,” she said.

Sarkar 
delivers 
official 

statement on renaming of C.C. 
Little building

Central Student Government 

President 
Anushka 
Sarkar, 

an LSA senior, used her time 
before the Board to lobby for 
efforts to rename the C.C. Little 
building. The building is named 
for former University President 
Clarence Cook Little, also an 
avowed eugenicist, and has been 
a site of controversy and protests 
this semester.

CSG, 
LSA 
Student 

Government 
and 
Rackham 

Student 
Government 
have 

all expressed support for the 
renaming.

“(Renaming is) a relatively 

simple way to demonstrate to 
the campus community that the 
University of Michigan does not 
glorify the leaders of our past 

that would test a good portion 
of our faculty, staff, and student 
body,” Sarkar said.

A formal request for the 

renaming, authored by four 
University 
faculty 
members 

and one student, is currently 
before the President’s Advisory 
Committee 
on 
University 

History. According to a new 
renaming policy released in 
January, the advisory board 
reviews the request and makes 
an initial decision, passing the 
proposal to the Board for a final 
vote. Sarkar implored the Board 
to consider the petition.

“Proponents of the name often 

cite the need to preserve our 
collective history … I recognize 
this as valid,” she said. “It’s 
more important to consider the 
ways in which we engage with 
our darker historical moments. 
There is a critical difference 
between 
understanding 
our 

history and glorifying our worst 
moments.”

LEO Bargaining

Public comments Thursday all 

focused on upcoming bargaining 
between the University and the 

Lecturers’ Em ployee Union. The 
union’s platform requests higher 
minimum salaries on all three 
campuses, a dedicated fund for 
lecturers advancing values of 
diversity, equity and inclusion 
and an extension of health care 
benefits. Lecturers who spoke 
before the Board on Thursday 
complained 
their 
University 

salaries were not competitive 
with positions at local high 
schools and community colleges.

Construction projects

The 
largest 
project 
the 

Board approved Thursday was 
a schematic design for $120 
million 
renovations 
to 
the 

Edward Krause building on 
North University Avenue. The 
building, which is adjacent to the 
Chemistry building currently 
houses the LSA Departments 
of Ecology and Evolutionary 
Biology and Molecular, Cellular 
and 
Developmental 
Biology, 

but the School of Kinesiology 
will also relocate to Krause 
following the architectural and 
mechanical renovations.

The project will be completed 

in the fall of 2020.

The report states police then 

noticed a crowd of about eight 
people surrounding a Hispanic 
male and then dragging him inside 
the house. The officers went up 
to the house and knocked on the 
door. When someone opened the 
door slightly, one officer forced 
their foot inside to stop the door 
from closing again, and entered 
the house thereafter.

Lambda 
brother 
Emilio 

Velazquez, 
an 
LSA 
junior, 

explained he and his brothers 
were forcing an agitated brother 
inside the house to protect him 
from reprisal.

“They came into our backyard 

without a warrant … they were 
putting people in handcuffs for 
loud noises,” he said. “They forced 
their way in without a warrant 
and took one of the guys who was 
holding the door and slammed 
him on the porch.”

One officer’s report, on the 

other hand, details a student 
who “tripped over the bottom 
ledge of the door, which caused 

him to lose balance.” The officer 
then “utilized and guided his 
momentum down to the porch.”

An 
email 
from 
the 

Multicultural 
Greek 
Council 

coordinator to Velazquez obtained 
by The Daily indicates AAPD is 
moving to file a public nuisance 
against the Lambda house for 
repeated offenses. In an interview 
with The Daily last year, AAPD 
Sgt. Thomas Hickey, community 
engagement lead, said officers’ 
party patrols only respond to 
referrals. Velazquez, however, 
maintained his house takes pains 
before events to ensure neighbors 
are not disturbed, and yet the 
tickets continue. He said he was 
not aware of other fraternities 
receiving this level of citations.

The Office of Greek Life 

declined to comment on this story.

These 
discrepancies 
in 

accounts are not uncommon 
between communities of color on 
campus and local police. A report 
by The Daily last year found Black 
students in particular to be wary 
of police after repeatedly hostile 
interactions 
on 
and 
around 

campus. Kappa Secretary Ka’marr 
Coleman-Byrd, a Business senior, 

said AAPD has not initiated any 
attempts at outreach — even after 
policing dialogues hosted by Black 
students. Many also perceive 
predominantly white chapters to 
have working relationships with 
AAPD.

“Last year we reached out to 

Ann Arbor police as well as the 
University police,” he said. “They 
have never made an effort to 
reach out to us. My trust towards 
police is really a case-by-case 
relationship. 
(Interfraternity 

Council) fraternities never get 
shut down when hosting a tailgate 
or party because they have an 
agreement with Ann Arbor police. 
It is unfair that we aren’t not given 
this same courtesy/ opportunity.” 

“I do think it’s a people of 

color issue because this doesn’t 
happen to the white fraternities 
on campus,” Velazquez agreed. “If 
you were to walk down Hill Street 
you’d see a bunch of kids partying 
and blasting music and you never 
see them get shut down.”

AAPD did not return requests 

for comment.

T

his piece is for those of 
you not directly affected 
by sexual assault. It has 

to do with my own life experience 
and in no way is a mold for 
how others experience events 
or emotions. I feel inclined to 
write a trigger warning, for this 
contains some tough shit — so 
this is it: trigger warning.

I’m sure you’ve heard of the 

recent news surrounding Harvey 
Weinstein. If you haven’t, he’s a 
famous director and producer 
who’s been accused of rape, 
sexual 
assault 
and 
sexual 

harassment by at least 40 women, 
as The New York Times reported. 
It’s been such a big story because 
of the wide network of people in 
Hollywood who were affected 
or 
knew 
about 
Weinstein’s 

abhorrent acts. Weinstein has 
been engaging in this behavior 
for over three decades — longer 
than I’ve even been alive.

To the naïve shock of some, I 

don’t feel surprised when I read 
these reports. This culture, rape 
culture, is one that I know well. 
As some prefer to eloquently put 
it, I’m a survivor of sexual assault. 
To me, that feels too fancy. In my 
head, it feels more right to call 
it what it was — a brutal rape. I 
do understand why people cling 
to the word survivor, though, 
because 
making 
it 
through 

each day since then has been an 
indescribable struggle.

The first few months following 

were full of visceral flashbacks, 
it was as if he was on my skin 
again. I wanted so badly to peel 
it off and start anew. Can you 
imagine that? Feeling like you 
have so little control of your own 
body, being so disgusted with 
what’s happened to you that the 
only way you can fathom living 
in this body any longer is if you 
could peel bits of it away?

I couldn’t sleep, either. And 

when I did, I was awoken by 
nightmares that replayed the 

trauma over and over and over. 
Sometimes I would be walking 
down the sidewalk or hallway 
and all of the sudden he was 
there, biting me and tackling 
me to the concrete. I would 
dissociate for what feels like 
eternity. Eventually someone 
would bring me back to reality. 
Maybe it’s my mom asking 
again what I want for dinner. 
Sometimes it’s my professor 

repeating an exam review. Either 
way, it felt and still feels like I 
can’t escape.

It’s been years and I still don’t, 

or rather can’t, comfortably let 
people touch me without being 
almost in a state of panic. Even 
the slight brush of my forearm 
sends shivers up my spine and 
adrenaline through my veins. 
Seeing distant family members 
over holiday breaks is a scene out 
of my worst nightmare — hugging 
and kissing multitudes of people, 
unable to say no comfortably. 
Some see my aversion to touch as 
an overreaction, but to me it’s a 
survival mechanism.

Every day is a different challenge, 

a different barrier in overcoming 
the trauma. Constantly repeating 
to myself that I’m not worthless 
or undeserving of my humanity 
or just a body for someone else’s 
pleasure. Constantly shouting in 
my own head that it’s not my fault, 
that I didn’t make up my memories, 
that I belong on this Earth.

I think this is why they use the 

word survivor.

I want to tell you this because 

I want you to understand why I 

can’t fight this battle by myself 
— or rather, why the victims of 
sexual assault and harassment 
can’t fight this by themselves. 
You might justify my request 
and your lack of action by saying 
that others don’t bear this level 
of pain, but does it matter? They 
probably wouldn’t tell you if they 
did, because the pain in you not 
believing us is almost like it’s 
happening over again; that we’re 
not worth our humanity, again.

I want you to understand 

why we can’t fight this battle 
ourselves. We fight our own 
internal battles every day, and we 
need allies to take to the streets 
and help. We need others to stand 
up and say something when they 
hear comments implying acts 
without consent or even just 
sexualizing other beings. We 
need to know that you are here 
for us, that you will defend us and 
that you believe us.

The silence that you allow 

is the violence that plagues 
my skin.

When you hear “locker room 

talk,” stop it. Let them know 
that’s not accepted here. You 
may face resistance. People may 
ask why you care about their 
conversation or state that it 
has nothing to do with you, but 
please continue fighting this 
with us. Please know that you are 
fighting one of the noblest battles 
in existence. You are the voice for 
those whose have been robbed, 
silenced and doubted. And from 
the bottom of my heart, I will 
always be grateful for that.

S

tudents in high school dream 
and breathe every waking 
moment about going away 

to college. In high school, students 
can feel stuck in a rut: same friends, 
same teachers, same homework, 
same pressure from peers to get 
good grades and from parents to ace 
the ACT or SAT, same competition 
from seemingly every student to 
get into the top schools. But in 
the distance, there is that exciting 
college scene, where we can go out, 
hang out, hook up, experiment with 
drugs and alcohol — all without 
any supervision, no parents to be 
accountable to. 

For freshman, the world is wide 

open: We can take classes we think 
we will enjoy, focus on studies and a 
possible major we think will fit, find 
relief from the pressure to ace the 
ACT or SAT and are excited about 
participating in a social scene on 
steroids, especially in the fall. It is 
heaven on Earth! Of course, students 
soon realize that the course load 
of “only” four classes is four times 
more than their eight classes in high 
school, and homework can bury 
us. College provides students with 
an immersive experience by living 
at the place we learn, but with that 
comes many challenges between 
balancing school, extracurriculars 
and social lives.

And after game day and studying 

24/7 for weeks on end, it happens: 
We get sick. Our parents are not here 
to tell us to get extra rest. We think 
we can push through what seems 
like a minor cold and ride it out if we 
just get a little extra sleep and leave 
the Thursday party at 11 p.m. instead 
of 2 a.m. Sometimes that works. 
Other times it doesn’t. As students at 
a top public university, the pressure 
of making a grade, making it to the 
game and making great friends often 
compromises our ability to focus 
on the most important factor of our 
existence: our health.

Important practices that were 

second nature to us when we lived 
with our parents can often seem like 
things of the past when it comes to 
coping with stress. We often think 
that if we stay up to finish the essay, 
we will be less stressed because we 
will get it done. But what if getting it 
done that night meant getting even 
sicker? At home, maybe our parents 
will remind us to get that extra sleep. 
But in college? All bets are off.

Studies show that sleep has a 

tremendous impact on learning. 
When we do not get enough 
sleep, we are drowsy in lecture 
the next day and we don’t retain 
the full capacity of information 
that we could when getting the 
recommended amount of rest. This 
lack of sleep affects our immune 
system, which is essential in college. 
Think about all the doorknobs, 
tables, elevator buttons and water 
fountain handles we press in a day. 
And a weaker immune system 
makes one even more susceptible to 
getting sick.

Lots of times, I forget to eat. 

Though it is not clear how many 
meals diet experts recommend, 
unless we take proper measures 
to eat healthy foods and satisfy our 
hunger, there are clear health risks 
down the line. But when our days 
are packed with classes, interviews, 
talks, meet-ups and office hours, it 
can be hard to remember that we 
need to sit down and eat a full meal, 
not just a venti iced coffee. It is 
common for students to joke about 
how little they have eaten in a day, 
how few hours of sleep they got the 
night before and how many cups 
of coffee they’ve had in the last 
hour. While it might seem comical 
on the surface, these subtle habits 
of placing academic and social 
activities before our health are the 
reasons we get sick.

In many big lecture classes 

at the University of Michigan, 
iClicker 
points 
count 
as 

participation in class and can have 

a large impact in students’ final 
grades. The competitiveness on 
campus accompanied by the rigor 
of the University makes students 
think that feeling unwell isn’t 
a valid excuse to miss lecture. 
Additionally, many upper level 
classes are smaller in size, which 
makes it obvious if someone is 
not there. Students place so much 
pressure on their commitment 
to the course that they neglect 
their body and their classmates by 
coming to class contagious.

Transitioning from high school 

life to a college campus is stressful 
for almost every student. Figuring 
out which school to attend, where 
to do homework, who to hang out 
with and go out with seem like trivial 
things for someone to worry about, 
but are legitimate problems lots of 
first year students face. Successfully 
juggling all the social and academic 
elements of college students need 
to succeed can be hard, and this 
excessive stress can lead to not 
focusing on other important factors, 
like our health.

As students, we need to realize 

that the only body we have in this 
life is the one that we are currently 
living in. Taking care of ourselves 
and our bodies are much more 
important than cramming all night 
for a midterm to try to get that extra 
grade boost; one that you may not 
even see and won’t matter much in 
the long run if we haven’t taken care 
of ourselves. The choices we make in 
response to stress hinder our ability 
to take care of ourselves physically, 
and we end up paying the price with 
a stuffy nose or a scratchy throat. 
Learning to take full responsibility 
for the decisions we make as students 
at the University that will affect our 
mind, body and health is essential to 
being successful and making it out of 
here alive.

Contextualize the Constitution

NOAH HARRISON | COLUMN

I

n the wake of the tragic mass 
shooting in Las Vegas, which 
claimed 58 innocent lives, 

political 
activists 
renewed 
the 

ongoing debate over gun control. 
In this iteration, the focus has been 
on “bump stocks,” the device that 
enabled the shooter to effectively 
convert his arsenal of firearms into 
automatic weapons. Invariably, this 
debate evolved into an impassioned 
reexamination 
of 
the 
Second 

Amendment, particularly over the 
extent to which it permits possession 
of modern weaponry.

If anything, the tense divide over 

gun rights underscores the lack of 
political consensus when it comes 
to interpreting the Constitution. 
Furthermore, it represents a larger 
trend where modernization and 
technological advancement clouds 
the meaning of the Constitution and 
serves as a reminder that in order 
for the Constitution to retain its 
relevance and reverence, we must 
continually contextualize it.

The 
text 
of 
the 
Second 

Amendment 
presents 
a 
more 

nuanced outlook than the oft-
repeated right to bear arms: “A well 
regulated Militia, being necessary to 
the security of a free State, the right 
of the people to keep and bear Arms, 
shall not be infringed.”

As the first clause indicates, the 

intention of the amendment was 
to arm those serving in a citizen 
militia. Though some liberals have 
argued this clause invalidates the 
right of non-militia members to bear 
arms, the Supreme Court has ruled 
otherwise. In the 2008 decision in the 
case of District of Columbia v. Heller, 
which struck down Washington, 
D.C.’s ban on handguns, the high 
court ruled that the amendment’s 
opening clause does not restrict 
the scope of the second clause. In 
other words, Americans have a 
constitutional right to bear arms 
regardless of whether they are 
members of a militia.

A secondary matter is the 

meaning of “arms,” which, taken 
out of context, seems to suggest a 
constitutional right to possess all 
weapons. However, in United States 
v. Miller, the Supreme Court ruled 
that the Second Amendment does not 
ensure the right to possess weapons 
unrelated to the preservation of a 
well-regulated militia. This decision, 
which upheld a law that requires 
firearms to be registered, seemingly 
verified a constitutional basis for gun 
control legislation.

Though these two cases seem to 

establish a functional interpretation 
that ensures a fundamental right 
to bear arms, while simultaneously 

empowering 
Congress 
to 

appropriately regulate guns, the 
debate is far from settled. Just last 
February, a federal appeals court 
rebuffed a challenge to Maryland’s 
assault rifle ban, ruling that these 
weapons are not covered by the 
Second Amendment. Wherever this 
debate leads, it is crucial that our 
modern application of the Second 
Amendment balances the ideal of 
self-protection 
while 
effectively 

regulating weapons that can take the 
lives of many in a matter of minutes.

The 
Second 
Amendment 
is 

just one of several sections of the 
Constitution 
requiring 
greater 

contextualization 
in 
response 

to 
technological 
advancement. 

Another is the Fourth Amendment, 
which ensures “the right of the 
people to be secure in their persons, 
houses, 
papers, 
and 
effects, 

against unreasonable searches and 
seizures,” and also requires probable 
cause-backed warrants for searches.

Drafted long before the age 

of 
electronic 
communication 

and 
surveillance, 
the 
Fourth 

Amendment now finds itself at the 
center of debates over the merits 
and constitutionality of surveillance 
measures designed to promote 
security, exemplified best by the 
PATRIOT Act.

Though 
passed 
with 

overwhelming bipartisan support, 
the PATRIOT Act quickly attracted 
controversy 
for 
its 
perceived 

infringements on civil liberties. 
Several sections of the law were 
ruled unconstitutional, and after the 
act expired in 2014, its replacement, 
the Freedom Act, added some 
judicial oversight.

A final area in need of examination 

is our electoral system. While 
democracy is arguably our nation’s 
most cherished value today, the 
Constitution was originally not very 
democratic. Many of the Founding 
Fathers feared the reactionary 
impulses of the people and restricted 
democratic access accordingly.

As our nation’s ideals have 

shifted to become increasingly 
democratic, the Constitution has 
required many revisions, namely 
the 12th, 15th, 17th, 19th and 26th 
Amendments, which collectively 
extended voting rights, established 
the direct election of senators and 
reformed presidential elections.

Today, we face new challenges 

in our attempts to ensure the 
Constitution 
aligns 
with 
our 

democratic 
values, 
including 

partisan 
gerrymandering 
and 

renewed scrutiny of the Electoral 
College. According to a Gallup poll, 
a narrow plurality of Americans 

favor replacing the Electoral College 
with the popular vote. Interestingly, 
before the issue became heavily 
politicized 
following 
the 
2016 

election, an overwhelming majority 
of Americans favored a switch to 
the popular vote, which could be 
accomplished via a constitutional 
amendment or through a pact 
between states to award their 
electoral votes to the winner of the 
popular vote.

The debate over the Electoral 

College is complicated by the fact that 
it was designed to select, rather than 
democratically elect, the president. 
It was only after state legislatures 
delegated the process of choosing 
electors to the people that ordinary 
citizens began to participate in the 
election of presidents.

With regards to gerrymandering, 

the Supreme Court heard oral 
arguments 
earlier 
this 
month 

on 
Wisconsin’s 
Congressional 

districts, which were systematically 
gerrymandered 
using 
advanced 

computer algorithms to benefit the 
Republican Party. While the Supreme 
Court has struck down race-based 
redistricting before, it has rarely 
addressed partisan gerrymandering. 
The Constitution says little about 
the redistricting process, and Chief 
Justice John Roberts warned in 
oral arguments that intervening in 
partisan 
gerrymandering 
would 

threaten 
the 
Supreme 
Court’s 

“status and integrity.” However, the 
court’s liberal wing was receptive 
to arguments against Wisconsin’s 
skewed 
districts, 
with 
several 

justices suggesting that partisan 
gerrymandering 
devalues 
the 

“precious right to vote.”

Partisan 
gerrymandering 
is 

a clear case where a contextual 
interpretation is needed to preserve 
the Constitution’s relevance. The 
Founding Fathers understandably 
failed to foresee the proliferation 
of 
partisan, 
technology-aided 

gerrymandering, but this should 
not invalidate their intention for our 
elections to be fair.

The late Supreme Court Justice 

Antonin Scalia once exclaimed, 
“the Constitution I interpret is not 
living but dead.” Scalia’s originalism 
is a respectable judicial philosophy, 
but pragmatically speaking, taking 
this approach risks diminishing 
the 
Constitution’s 
applicability 

to modern issues. Simply put, the 
Constitution is an 18th century 
document, and failure to recognize 
this runs contrary to the modern 
needs of the country.

Humanizing women

P

eople don’t like to talk 
about women. Yet, from 
the 
slow 
emergence 

of mainstream feminism to 
the backlash and outrage in 
regard to the Harvey Weinstein 
allegations, 
discussions 

surrounding 
women 
and 

women’s rights have taken on 
a larger role in the media. As 
conversations turn to women, 
it’s easy to refer to women as a 
commodity. The term “women” 
starts to refer to a generalized 
object and not to nearly half of 
the world’s population. With 
this 
generalization 
comes 

an 
emotional 
distance 
that 

permeates the conversation. 

Politically, women’s bodies 

are under attack. A woman’s 
right to personal autonomy over 
her sexual and reproductive 
health is constantly threatened. 
At state levels, legislators are 
restricting access to abortion 
clinics and providers. At the 
federal level, elected officials 
aim to criminalize abortions by 
punishing abortion providers 
who perform the procedure 
after 20 weeks, as indicated by 
a majority vote in the House 
passed Oct. 3.

Abortion has been a taboo 

subject for as long as it has existed. 
The first United States law 
restricting abortions was passed 
in 1821. Since then, legislators 
have worked tirelessly to control 
and criminalize women’s bodies. 
From religious zealots citing 
bible verses to pseudo-science 
wielding misogynists, anti-choice 
advocates have employed any 
number of tactics to vilify abortion 
and the women who undergo 
them. Whether it be for fear of 
backlash or judgment, people who 
have had abortions often find it 
hard to tell their stories.

When we talk about abortion, 

we tend to use statistics and 
macro-level 
statements. 

It 
becomes 
easy 
to 
forget 

that 
despite 
its 
prevalence, 

individuals’ stories tend not to be 
told. To decide whether to have 
an abortion is a subjective and 
personal choice often riddled 
with anxiety and fear. However, 
the extraneous circumstances 
that factor into this decision are 
often ignored or downplayed. 
An essential aspect of the 
pro-choice movement is the 
emphasis on individual choice, 
something so many women are 

already without.

At 6 p.m. on Saturday, Students 

for Choice will be hosting their 
fifth annual Abortion Speak 
Out in the Hussey Room of 
the Michigan League. This is 
an opportunity and space for 
members of the community to 
come together and share their 
experiences without fear of 
judgment or anger.

Please bring your MCard 

with you to the event, and keep 
in mind that to maintain the 
privacy and safety of community 
members, Students for Choice 
asks that you refrain from using 
photography, videography or 
recording materials during the 
event. This year, Students for 
Choice will also be screening 
a new documentary directed 
by Tracy Droz Tragos titled 
“Abortion: Stories Women Tell.”

If 
you 
have 
personal 

experience 
with 
abortion, 

consider sharing your story here 
confidentially and anonymously 
or at the Speak Out. If you 
haven’t had personal experience 
with 
abortion, 
Student 
for 

Choice still encourages you 
to attend in demonstration of 
support and solidarity.

“The silence that 
you allow is the 

violence that 

plagues my skin.”

ALFAMA

‘Barrage’ premiered at Chicago Film Festival this week

COMMUNITY CULTURE REVIEW
Douglas Trevor christens 
latest ‘Wonders’ at Literati

“The music of a short story 

… is made up of cymbals and 
screams and the metal of a 
DC-10, twisting and crashing 
into the cold, dead earth. No 
survivors, friends. No one makes 
it out alive.”

No one at Literati on Tuesday 

night took Douglas Trevor’s 
death 
omen 
seriously. 
Or 

maybe they did. Either way, the 
bookstore’s second-floor was 
packed with readers (filling 
every seat and every place to 
stand) excited for the release 
of “The Book of Wonders,” 
the newest collection of short 
stories by Trevor, a professor of 
English and Creative Writing. 

The smells and sips of coffee 

brewing at the cafe (tempting 
for a coffee lover despite the 
dangers of drinking caffeine 
at 7 p.m.) delighted noses and 
tongues 
of 
attendees; 
ears 

and eyes were treated with a 
vibrant reading of the first half 
of Trevor’s story “The Novelist 
and the Short Story Teller.”

It follows Thom, a short-

story writer of experimental 
fiction for obscure journals, and 
Ellen, a novelist of a work titled 
“Hand Job,” who both attend 
the “Upstart Conference in the 
Hills” for writers. While Ellen 
presents herself to the crowd 
with endearing words and a 
wave, it is the ominous Thom 
who claims that short stories are 
death music with “no survivors.”

“The 
book’s 
really 
about 

exploring the ways that people 
at different junctures in their 
lives try to get through difficult 
times and … the ridiculous, 
and in some ways, the not-so-
ridiculous ways that we try 
to connect with other people 
and reinvent ourselves,” said 

Trevor in an interview with The 
Michigan Daily. At the same 
time, the stories that comprise 
“The Book of Wonders” include 
moments of goofiness that are 
intended to amuse readers.

In this way, Trevor’s reading 

at Literati proved to be the 
proper way to inaugurate his 
new work. The humor in his 
reading was well-received with 
laughter from the audience, as 
would be expected in response 

to Trevor reciting in a deep 
voice and with a low stare, “‘I 
love the circle jerk in Hand 
Job.’” 
And 
to 
release 
this 

collection — one that endeavors 
to show how human connection 
manifests itself, even in the 
most obscure of circumstances 
— in a communal setting where 
his 
potential 
readers 
could 

react and connect to the story 
together seemed perfectly in 
line with the book’s intentions. 
Together, the audience could see 
Thom’s attempt at conversation 
with Ellen about hand jobs as 
more than a humorous detail: It 
is an attempt to connect.

“Short stories are constituted 

as much by what isn’t in them 

as opposed to what is,” Trevor 
said. That being the case, the 
excitement and the challenge 
of writing a short story is “that 
you give your reader a glimpse 
... into the given circumstances 
surrounding a given person, and 
the reader can connect with that 
person even if they only know 
that person over the course of a 
few pages.”

Trevor is practiced in the 

literary 
challenge 
of 
short 

stories. He is a celebrated 
author who has won awards 
for his previous collection of 
short stories, “The Thin Tear 
in the Fabric of Space,” and 
for his novel, “Girls I Know.” 
Additionally, he has published 
stories 
in 
multiple 
literary 

journals. Trevor is also the 
Director of the Helen Zell 
Writers program, whose mission, 
as stated on the program’s 
website, — “to embody and value 
those practices that speak to 
the importance of empathy and 
compassion” — Trevor applies in 
his own writing.

“Literary endeavor is one of 

the most important means by 
which we try to foster empathy 
in other people and remind 
people of the importance of 
different perspectives,” Trevor 
said. All of the eyebrow-raising 
and laugh-inducing stories in 
“The Book of Wonders” — one in 
which an isolated librarian seeks 
to satisfy his intense longing to 
feel the sensation of butterfly 
wings by touching a young girl’s 
eyelids, and another in which a 
lonely CPA invites a mysterious 
animal control man to live in her 
bed for days — are applications 
of literature as a tool to show 
how people connect.

“The Book of Wonders” is now 

available in stores and available 
for anyone who wishes to read 
and connect to these accounts of 
various wondrous happenings.

Opening the Chamber of 
Secrets in our own stalls

Almost exactly one year ago, I 

spent a Saturday visiting all the 
girls’ bathrooms on campus to 
document the graffiti in them. 
I was writing an essay for a 
journalism / memoir writing 
class, and had been thinking 
about women’s spaces on campus 
after spending the summer doing 
research on the history of women 
at U-M. I had also been mulling 
over how the girl’s bathroom 
feels like an unusually influential 
place in girl’s lives — at least, it 
has been in my and all my friends’ 
lives. It has been both a place of 
exclusion and inclusion, of mental 
breakdowns and fun wild nights, a 
strange kind of solidarity.

A lot of what I saw scribbled on 

stall walls was sweet: Messages 
of hope, funny anecdotes, quotes, 
even several political dialogues 
— one stall was literally covered 
in 
discussions 
of 
privilege, 

appropriation and the current 
political 
climate 
on 
campus. 

Somehow, the inspirational quotes 
scrawled in Sharpie on the inside 
doors of these bathroom stalls 
felt more intimate, despite their 
technically public nature, than, 
say, chalked inspiration on the 
Diag. By the end of the afternoon, I 
was excited; I felt like I understood 
the graffiti lexicon of the ladies’ 
room, and could definitely write 
an essay about it.

On my way out of Angell 

Hall, I decided to check one 
final bathroom. In the last stall I 
looked into, under the toilet paper 
dispenser — so you could only 
see it if you were sitting down or 
bending over deliberately to look 
— I saw something etched into the 
wall, and underlined:

“Campus rapists.”
Underneath it, there was a 

single name, almost too faint to 
read. This bathroom looked like it 
hadn’t been painted in years; there 
was no way of knowing how long 
ago someone had decided to pull 

out her keys and warn other girls 
in what might have been the only 
way she felt like she could.

I went home and took a long 

shower after that.

I’ve been thinking a lot about 

that etched name recently, as 
Harvey Weinstein’s name joins 
those of the past few years: Bill 
Cosby. 
Casey 
Affleck. 
Roger 

Ailes… the list, as we all know 
and choose to forget, goes on, 
and on and on. I’ve been trying 
to think about something new 
to say about rich and powerful 
men getting away with sexual 

assault in this industry. But there 
isn’t anything new to say. It’s all 
already been said, and reworded, 
and retweeted, and turned into a 
hashtag and a think piece, and said 
again.

As per usual, people have 

combed through the media of 
the last decade looking for hints, 
suggestions, clues to prove that 
Weinstein’s 
behavior 
wasn’t 

unknown. In one video going viral, 
an interviewer asks Courtney 
Love for advice she would give to 
a young girl moving to Hollywood. 
There’s a flash of recognition in 
Love’s eyes; looking away from the 
camera, she says, “I’ll get libeled if 
I say it,” almost to herself. Then, 
making a decision, she leans into 
the camera and wryly remarks, “If 
Harvey Weinstein invites you to a 
private party in the Four Seasons, 
don’t go.” That was from 2005.

I could write about what a 

retrospective combing through 
clues by the media looks like 
to survivors of assault who are 
used to not being believed — 
even those whose stories have 
been 
corroborated 
time 
and 

again. I could write about all 
of the different hashtag trends 
that have been borne of this 
story — #womenboycottTwitter, 
#WOCaffirmation, and #metoo 
— 
and 
all 
of 
the 
inherent 

contradictions or problems with 
them. I could write about how 
exhausting it is to keep hearing 
simplistic debates over separating 
the art from the artist (although 
calling Weinstein an artist would 
be a bit of a stretch — and besides, 
I’ve already done that).

As much as all of those thoughts 

are swirling around in my head — 
as I sit scrolling through Facebook, 
watching as #metoo appears on 
the profiles of well over half of my 
women friends from high school 
or college — I keep thinking about 
how Courtney Love struggled 
in front of a camera between 
that simultaneously public and 
private 
warning, 
ultimately 

choosing to risk it. About how we 
are constantly having to wrestle 
with ourselves in situations like 
this, negotiating between private 
whispered warnings and public 
shouts. Because the stuff in the 
middle — the obligatory self-aware 
Billy Cosby jokes at award shows, 
the semi-ironically given statistics 
on late night TV, the hashtags 
that get us banned from Twitter 
— none of it ever seems to make a 
difference. And more often than 
not, in this struggle to choose to go 
big or go home, going big doesn’t 
make much of a difference either.

I can’t help but keep thinking 

about that faintly etched name on 
that bathroom wall. That chamber 
of secrets, if you will.

A couple weeks ago, I checked 

that stall again, to see if it was still 
there. It had been painted over.

My third day at the Chicago 

International Film Festival began 
with “Barrage,” a film from 
Luxembourg and the country’s 
submission for the Oscar for Best 
Foreign Language Film. Written 
and directed by Laura Schroeder 
in her feature length debut, 
“Barrage” tells a rather common 
story 
with 
flair. 
Schroeder’s 

film revolves around the trio of 
women — a mother, a daughter 
and 
the 
daughter’s 
daughter. 

The matriarch, Elisabeth (the 
legendary 
Isabelle 
Huppert, 

“Things to Come”), has raised 
her 
granddaughter 
(Themis 

Pauwels, “Suite Française”) since 
her daughter, Catherine (Lolita 
Chammah, 
“Anton 
Tchékhov 

1890,” 
and 
Huppert’s 
own 

daughter), skipped town. When 
the estranged Catherine returns, 
what was something of a cohesive 
relationship between grandmother 
and granddaughter disintegrates. 
Catherine all but abducts Alba, 
taking her to her own apartment 
and to a countryside home that 
stayed in the family.

The idea of a mother returning 

to plead for a new role in her child’s 
life isn’t terribly new — last year’s 
“Krisha,” for instance, was a 
fantastic horror riff on the concept, 
and Meryl Streep’s Oscar-winning 
turn in “Kramer vs. Kramer” 
helped establish her career — but 
Schroeder’s screenplay draws its 

characters rather vividly. This 
is no doubt due to the very real 
mother-daughter 
relationship 

between Chammah and Huppert. 
It’s awfully hard to hold one’s own 
against Huppert, but if there’s 
anyone who could attempt it, 
it’s her own daughter. Pauwels 
delivers a great performance as 
well: even at her young age, the 
film treats her with respect as an 
equal participant in the weekend’s 
events, not as a pawn in a fight 
between mother and daughter. 
The film’s boxy aspect ratio 
splendidly frames the lush green 
forestry, set against a dreary, gray 
sky, that drapes much of the film 
when Catherine and Alba retreat 
to the countryside home. At two 
hours, though, it can feel rather 
over-extended, and the needle 

drops that dot the film’s runtime 
don’t land quite as powerfully as 
they should.

Schroeder was present after the 

screening for a Q&A. I asked her 
what role, if any, improvisation 
played in the making of the film. 
“I didn’t have much time for 
[improvisation] because you have 
your crew and you have your 
schedule, too,” she said. “It’s very 
much prepared.” But even within 
these confines, she acknowledges 
that often the film demands 
some on-the-spot changes, when 
her actresses propose a new 
interpretation or, specifically in the 
film’s case, if the weather doesn’t 
cooperate. “I like it, the way it 
comes out in the film now, you 
know, but the weather conditions 
weren’t at all as I intended them to 
be.”

“God’s Own Country,” a love 

story between a British farmer’s 
son and his father’s Romanian 
hired hand, tells a familiar story 
in a new context. It’s “Brokeback 
Mountain” by way of British social 
realism, in a wonderful feature 
debut by Francis Lee. Johnny, the 
restless Brit, feels trapped at home 
on the family farm; he goes into 
town and heavily drinks each night, 
violently expunging his body of 
the alcohol-spiked shame in ritual 
cacophony in the early hours of the 
morning. Along comes Gheorghie, 
bearded and quiet and often in a 
knit sweater, who takes up some 
of the farm work after Johnny’s 
father (Ian Hart, “Harry Potter 
and the Sorcerer’s Stone”) remains 
incapacitated 
after 
a 
stroke. 

At first antagonistic — Johnny 
calls Gheorghie a gypsy — their 
relationship develops over a stretch 
of days spent alone in cabin set up 
for birthing goats (or lambs, I’m no 
expert). They become intimate and 
the moments they share together 
brim with energy.

Where “Brokeback Mountain” 

and Lee’s film diverge, aside from 
the British countryside, is how the 
protagonists’ sexuality is treated 
by the film’s world. Simply put, 
no one cares; no one is mocked or 
denigrated for being gay. And it’s so, 
so refreshing. Johnny has sex with 

other men and it feels unremarkable 
and, more importantly, normalized. 
When Gheorghie comes along, their 
intimacy is stylized and filmed 
with an artistic flourish, not with 
removed 
voyeurism, 
but 
with 

aroused participation. It’s sensual, 
and it’s about time.

At just short of two hours, “God’s 

Own Country” can drag a bit, 
especially since its style, like other 
young British directors, is very 
bare in its felicity to realism (as an 
example, see Andrew Haigh’s 2011 

queer romantic drama “Weekend” 
or 
William 
Oldroyd’s 
“Lady 

Macbeth” from this summer). The 
film also includes, but does not 
address in any meaningful way, 
some degree of ethnic animosity 
from Johnny to Gheorghie when 
they first meet, which pretty 
quickly dissolves as their romance 
develops. But on balance, “God’s 
Own Country” is a splendid 
romantic tale that one can only 
hope serves as a harbinger for queer 
love stories to come.

“Princess Cyd,” the latest film 

from Chicago-based filmmaker 
Stephen Cone (“Henry Gamble’s 
Birthday Party”), is, according to 
the writer and director, his “love 
letter” to the city. Unsurprisingly, 
then, it played well before the 
Chicago crowd (which included 
many crew members and the first 
gathering of the four main actors). 
Cyd (Jessie Pinnick, “Shameless”), 
a high school student, comes to 
Chicago in the summer to look at 
colleges. She stays at the childhood 
house 
of 
her 
mother, 
where 

Miranda Ruth (Rebecca Spence, 
“Easy”), Cyd’s aunt and a relatively 
successful novelist, lives. Cyd, like 
many teenagers, is interested in 
sex and love. Miranda, a bookish 
academic, is interested in other 
pleasures. The two have a strange 
relationship, not having seen each 
other for several years.

It’s 
delightful. 
The 
weaves 

that unspool over the film’s brisk 
96 minutes aren’t particularly 
unpredictable — Cyd starts to 
appreciate 
her 
aunt’s 
writing 

(and values), and Miranda starts 
to think of herself more sexually 
— but the on-screen between the 
pair feels so real because of how 
unique the relationship between 
aunt and niece is. They’re both 
caught off-guard by how little 
they know about each other. When 
Cyd confesses, or rather asks 
discreetly about, her attraction for 
another girl, Miranda’s response 
is inquisitive and friendly, like a 
supportive parent, but she also 
deftly maintains her ground in the 
liminal space between close peer 
and loving guardian. Many will be 
quick to praise Pinnick, which is 
fair, as Cyd is delightful, but the real 
star-making performance here is 
Spence, who has such a mastery of 
using the camera to her advantage. 
Cone’s cast is suffused with 
excellent Chicago theater actors, 
but Spence is the best of the bunch.

Unlike 
Cone’s 
other 
films, 

“Princess Cyd” doesn’t wade too 
deeply in the waters of dissecting 
white Christian culture; religion 
is discussed a bit, but it isn’t one of 
the film’s central currents. But even 
without his usual subject, Cone’s 
film is deeply humanist. He adores 
his characters and it’s contagious.

Watching 
“Mr. 
Robot” 

is 
rarely 
a 
comfortable 

experience. It’s a show that 
makes 
viewers 
constantly 

question every single detail 
of the world they are being 
presented, forcing them to 
see the world through the 
distorted lens of the brilliant 
but 
troubled 
protagonist 

Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek, 
“Buster’s Mal Heart”). As the 
show has progressed, the plot 
has become progressively more 
complex and intriguing, not to 
mention more violent and, at 
points, simply bizarre.

With that being said, as I 

watched season two of the 
show (for which Rami Malek 
won an Emmy for Outstanding 
Lead Actor in a Drama Series), 
I couldn’t help but feel as if the 
plot sometimes devolved into 
a convoluted mess simply for 
the sake of being so. Despite 
maintaining 
its 
masterful 

grasp on creating tension and 
intriguing storylines, it lost 

focus on the core conflict of 
the show: Elliot vs. his own 
grasp on reality. After the 
revelation of the main twist 
halfway through season two, 
however, 
the 
show 
picked 

up this conflict again, and 
the season three premiere 

(titled 
“eps3.0_power-saver-

mode.h”) effectively continues 
its development.

We are left at the beginning 

of season three wondering 
about the fate of Elliot after his 
shooting at the hands of Tyrell 
Wellick (Martin Wallström, 
“Ashes in the Snow”), the 
unstable 
former 
E 
Corp 

executive. In the meantime, as 
the financial markets continue 
to plunge, the world descends 
further into chaos. The sinister 
Chinese hacker group the Dark 
Army 
continues 
to 
pursue 

Elliot’s 
sister 
and 
fellow 

hacker Darlene (Carly Chaikin, 
“In a World…”) while its leader 
Whiterose (B.D. Wong, “The 
Space Between Us”) continues 
to manipulate Elliot’s closest 
friend, Angela Moss.

What seems to be one of 

season three’s most interesting 
additions is Irving. Played 
wonderfully by veteran Bobby 
Cannavale, in what is a rather 
unusual role for him, he is 
a used car salesman who 
appears to be a Dark Army 
operative. In a memorable first 
scene at a barbeque restaurant, 
we are introduced to a couple 
quirks 
including 
his 
ever-

present 
Bluetooth 
headset 

and his unnervingly cool and 
composed way of speaking 
that probably belies just how 
dangerous he is.

As usual, the cinematography 

is careful and methodical, 
adding to the dark and sinister 
atmosphere. 
Around

TV REVIEW

middle of the episode, when 
Darlene is being pursued by 
Dark Army associates while in 
an underground hackerspace, 
I squirmed in my chair as the 
camera followed Darlene in the 
middle of an anxiety attack. 
Very few shows I have watched 
have ever provided the visceral 
physical 
response 
that 
Mr. 

Robot provides week-in and 
week-out.

Another 
aspect 
of 
the 

production that continues to 
be excellent is the music. Sure, 
it contains the common trope 
of associating Trent Reznor’s 
“The 
Social 
Network”-style 

electronic 
montages 
with 

anything relating to “hacking,” 

but unexpected touches such as 
the use of Daft Punk’s “Touch” 
in a pivotal scene make certain 
moments instantly memorable.

Regarding the storyline, the 

show is more unpredictable 
than 
ever. 
Elliot’s 
“other” 

personality, 
Mr. 
Robot 

(Christian 
Slater) 
does 
not 

appear anymore while Elliot is, 
well, Elliot, but he is definitely 
alive and well, eager as ever 
to exact revenge upon E Corp. 
Only he and Angela, however, 
seem to have a discernible 
motive 
for 
their 
actions. 

Whiterose 
(normally 
seen 

as Chinese defense minister 
Zheng) is still as enigmatic as 
ever, and it remains to be seen 

what exactly her endgame is, 
and whether Elliot’s father and 
Angela’s mother truly died for a 
“greater good.”

What “Mr. Robot” continues 

to do so effectively is explore 
technology’s influence on the 
modern world, as well as topics 
such as personal alienation, 
the corrupting influences of 
greed and the harmful effects 
of capitalism in a nuanced 
manner. Hopefully, it retains 
its realism and psychological 
thriller elements that make it 
successful even if it veers in a 
more sci-fi direction, allowing 
it to continue to be one of 
television’s 
most 
intriguing 

shows.

Courtney Barnett of Courtney Barnett/Kurt Vile

ALBUM REVIEW

Courtney Barnett has become 

a leading artist across genres after 
her debut album, Sometimes I Sit 
and Think, and Sometimes I Just 
Sit was released in March of 2015. 
This release gave the world a taste 
of her talent for writing hypnotic 
guitar riffs and enticing lyrics that 
effortlessly fall off the tongue. These 
abilities landed her a nomination for 
Best New Artist in the 58th Annual 
Grammy Awards, and prompted 
NPR to name her the greatest 
lyricist in rock right now.

After a few tours and festival 

appearances, 
Barnett 
became 

acquainted 
with 
indie 
singer- 

songwriter Kurt Vile. Vile is best 
known for being the founding 
guitarist in The War on Drugs. He 
eventually started writing his own 
lo-fi bedroom tunes and released his 
first solo album, Constant Hitmaker, 
in 2008.

In 2015 after meeting while 

on the festival circuit, Vile wrote 
“Over 
Everything,” 
specifically 

for Barnett, and told Rolling Stone 
he had imagined singing it with 
her. After that, the two began 
communicating via email and 
Skype, sending each other half-

songs, bouncing ideas around. They 
did a few renditions of songs, wrote 
some of their own and decided there 
was enough material to release their 
collaboration album: Lotta Sea Lice.

Some of the tracks on Lotta Sea 

Lice are beautifully done covers. 
The third track is a slow and dreamy 
cover of “Fear is like a Forest” by 
Jen Cloher, where their voices trail 
into the clouds, leaving soft hanging 
notes to hold onto, and the last 

track is a rendition of Belly’s 1993 
“Untogether.” Barnett and Vile 
then immerse themselves into each 
other and their distinct, deadpan 
writing styles by covering each 
other’s songs: Barnett’s “Outta the 
Woodwork” and Vile’s “Peepin’ 
Tomboy.”

Viles 
and 
Barnett’s 
voices 

immediately 
compliment 
each 

other on the first track, “Over 
Everything.” It starts with a soft 
drum pattern and traveling guitar 
riffs that pull from the bluegrass 
jam influence Vile is known for. 
The lyrics call attention to feelings 
of loneliness and explore how Vile 

and Barnett console themselves 
with their art. “When I’m by myself 
and it’s daytime cuz down-under 
/ Or wherever it is I live when it’s 
evening / You know I speed-read 
the morning news and come up 
with my / own little song also.”

Each of the songs thereafter 

feel a bit lethargic. The two talents 
are mostly known for their lyrical 
work, 
and 
their 
collaborative 

poetry sometimes gets lost in the 
instrumentals of the record. The 
pair plays tunes that feel like an 
elongated jam sesh, especially in 
the four-minute long “On Script,” 
with only three verses sung above 
the instrumentals. Barnett takes 
her time hitting each note. Her voice 
feels like a breath of words hanging 
in the humid July air, so thick you 
can almost see it.

The entirety of the record feels 

like a stream of consciousness. 
There is no specific beginning, 
end, or middle: It’s just a flow of 
emotion. Its lyrical content reflects 
on mundane, but important feelings 
that surround people in their 
everyday endeavors. It feels honest 
and human: things that Vile and 
Barnett are experts at embracing 
on their solo-projects. Vile’s rustic 
voice and Barnett’s angelic tone, 
all backed by hazy instrumentals, 
form a cloudy, long daydream that 
is Lotta Sea Lice.

FOOD
Ann Arbor’s Best Bites: 
HopCat’s Pretzel Nuggz

Writer’s Note: I enjoy two 

things in nearly equal amounts: 
eating, 
and 
telling 
people 

what to do. Perhaps above all 
is my love for telling people 
what to eat. Left unchecked, 
I will arrive at a restaurant 
with 
your 
order 
already 

planned. I eat systematically 
and strategically, controlling 
another’s 
order 
allows 
me 

to 
maximize 
my 
options, 

which is important because 
before I graduate I’d like to 
have eaten my way through 
Ann Arbor. It’s not a feasible 
quest: I won’t actually be able 
to eat everywhere in my two 
remaining years, but I’m going 
to see how far I can get.

A conjoined perk of my Ann 

Arbor 
culinary 
adventures 

and love for telling people 
what to eat is that I’ve become 
pretty good at giving food 
recommendations. Which is 

where this series comes in. I 
get genuinely excited whenever 
I 
come 
across 
something 

incredibly delicious, and my 
friends have only so many 
ears for listening. So I decided 
to create a series where I can 
expound 
upon 
my 
favorite 

things to eat in Ann Arbor. 
Best Bites isn’t a list of the top 
restaurants or places to eat, but 
rather a collection of the most 
delicious single items / dishes 
one can find in the city.

—
HopCat’s 
Pretzel 
Nuggz 

are reason alone to visit the 
brewery. Yes, I know the 
restaurant is known for its 
famous crack fries, and yes, 
they are extremely good, but 
I’m telling you, the pretzel 
nuggz are even better. I could 
wax poetic about the nuggz 
for hours. I talk about them 
to anyone one who asks, and 
many, many more who don’t. 
I’m a bonafide obsessee.

First off, the word “nugget,” 

or actually in HopCat’s case, 

“nuggz,” is enough to sell me 
on any item. I’m a fan of any 
food that’s a nugget in disguise 
(boneless wings, I’m looking 
at you). So of course, when I 
spotted the pretzel nuggz on 
the menu, I immediately pulled 
the trigger. As much as I like 
nugget-shaped foods, I was not 
expecting them to be this good. 
These 
nuggets 
are 
doughy 

pillows of pretzel perfection. 
They’re coated in a copious 
amount of butter and salt, 
and are served with a cheese 
dipping sauce. Butter, bread, 
salt and cheese is a winning 
combination in any context, 
but HopCat manages to marry 
the ingredients better than 
any other restaurant I’ve been 
to. Like I said, I’m obsessed. 
These things are scrumptious, 
they’re well worth a try. (Oh, 
one last thing, insider’s tip: 
All appetizers are half off on 
Monday nights.)

Breakdown: No. 2 Penn State set to overpower No. 19 Michigan

Michigan hasn’t beaten an 

opponent ranked in the top-
five of the AP Top 25 poll since 
September 
of 
2006. 
Eleven 

seasons ago, the 11th-ranked 
Wolverines dominated No. 2 
Notre Dame in South Bend, 
delivering the Fighting Irish 
a 47-21 loss — the most points 
scored against Notre Dame at 
home in 46 years.

Flash forward to 2017, and 

the No. 19 Michigan football 
team (2-1 Big Ten, 5-1 overall) 
has a chance to repeat the feat 
Saturday in State College against 
No. 2 Penn State (3-0, 6-0).

With 
the 
ESPN 
College 

Gameday treatment, a primetime 
national 
television 
slot 
and 

a white-out crowd at Beaver 
Stadium, the Nittany Lions will 
certainly have an atmosphere 
built up in their favor. The 
Wolverines will try to play the 
spoiler, but whether or not they 
can pull it off is an entirely 
different question.

Here’s how Michigan matches 

up 
against 
Penn 
State 
on 

Saturday night.

Michigan pass offense vs 

Penn State pass defense

Coming off fifth-year senior 

John O’Korn’s 10-for-20, 58-yard 
performance last week, this is 
the phase of the game that has 
induced the most anxiety among 
the Wolverine faithful — and for 
good reason.

Throughout the first half of 

the season, Michigan’s offense 
has 
been 
inept. 
That’s 
no 

secret. But after last week, the 
Wolverines’ run game seems to 
be in much better shape, which 
leaves the passing attack as the 
biggest problem facing the team.

The Nittany Lions and their 

vaunted defense have all the tools 
to exploit that problem to the 
fullest degree. Penn State ranks 
third in the nation in passing 
efficiency defense, as it has given 
up just 1007 yards in six games. 
The Nittany Lions have already 

picked off their opponents nine 
times while allowing just three 
touchdowns through the air. 

This is a clear mismatch. It 

wouldn’t be a surprise to see 
redshirt freshman quarterback 
Brandon Peters take some snaps 
under center if things get out of 
hand.

Edge: Penn State
Michigan run offense vs 

Penn State run defense

As alluded to in the previous 

section, Michigan’s ground game 
is moving in the right direction, in 
large part due to the rise of junior 
running back Karan Higdon.

Prior to the season, Higdon 

seemed to be the third-string 
back in the Wolverines’ three-
man rotation. Instead, he has 
taken the first half of the year 
by storm, breaking out from 
the pack as the clear starter. He 
topped off his emergence last 
week with a career-best 200-
yard, 
three-touchdown 
day 

against Indiana.

While Higdon and his fellow 

backs have played well, they have 
yet to face off against a defense 
as tough as Penn State’s. The 
Nittany Lions average 3.09 yards 
allowed per rush and have given 
up just four touchdowns on the 
season.

Penn State has the ninth-best 

overall defense in the country 
and has allowed the fewest 
touchdowns of any team so far. 
For an offense as anemic as 
Michigan’s, that will likely be too 
much to overcome.

Edge: Penn State
Penn State pass offense vs 

Michigan pass defense

For as much Heisman hype 

as running back Saquon Barkley 
attracts, he might not even be 
the best offensive player on the 
Nittany Lions’ roster. That would 
be quarterback Trace McSorley.

While 
some 
dual-threat 

quarterbacks use their legs to 
compensate for a lackluster arm, 
that couldn’t be farther from the 
truth for McSorley. He has one of 
the best passer efficiency ratings 
in the country at 154.1 after 

averaging 266.2 yards per game 
with a total of 13 touchdowns 
and a completion percentage of 
67. On top of that, he boasts four 
rushing touchdowns and 2.5 
yards per carry.

But McSorley will have his 

most challenging test against 
Michigan’s No. 1 ranked defense. 
The Wolverines lead the nation 
in passing efficiency defense, 
specifically, 
after 
giving 
up 

just 828 yards in the air while 
tallying five interceptions and 
allowing five touchdowns.

Behind 
junior 
safety 

Tyree Kinnel and sophomore 
cornerback 
Lavert 
Hill, 
the 

secondary 
looks 
ready 
for 

McSorley. But he might still be 
one step ahead.

Edge: Penn State
Penn State run offense vs 

Michigan run defense

As good as Barkley is, he has 

seemingly hit a rough patch. 

After rushing for over 200 yards 
against Iowa a month ago, he 
hasn’t broken the 100-yard mark 
in the two games since.

Last week, Northwestern held 

Barkley to 75 yards on 16 carries, 
though he did score twice. And 
the week before, Indiana shut 
him down completely, keeping 
him out of the end zone while 
also holding him to a measly 56 
yards on 20 carries.

Neither of those defenses 

are anywhere near as good as 
Michigan’s. 
The 
Wolverines 

have given up an average of 
just 85.8 yards per game on the 
ground, including an average of 
2.64 yards per rush, with a total 
of three touchdowns allowed.

Michigan combined for seven 

tackles-for-loss 
against 
the 

Hoosiers, and then spent the 
week claiming that the defensive 
unit has yet to reach its full 
potential. That isn’t a good sign 

for Barkley.

Edge: Michigan
Special teams
While both punters are evenly 

matched, 
between 
the 
two 

kickers, there is no competition.

Redshirt freshman kicker, and 

former Penn State commit, Quinn 
Nordin continues to impress 
with his consistency, adding two 
more field goals to his name to 
run his record up to 14-for-16. 
Penn State kicker Tyler Davis 
couldn’t be much more opposite. 
He has made just six field goals 
out of 13 attempts, missing all but 
two of his attempts from farther 
than thirty yards out.

After wresting the starting job 

away from sophomore Will Hart, 
freshman punter Brad Robbins 
made the most of it against 
Indiana. Out of nine punts, 
Robbins averaged 40.8 yards and 
downed three of them inside the 
20-yard line.

Meanwhile, 
Nittany 
Lion 

punter 
Blake 
Gillikin 
has 

averaged 44.2 yards on his 26 
punts — seven of which went 
longer than 50 yards. 

Edge: Michigan
Intangibles
Though it may be hard to 

believe, it was just a season ago 
that Michigan routed Penn State, 
49-10. That latter team went on 
to run the table and capture the 
Big Ten title.

The only game the Nittany 

Lions have lost since then was a 
hard-fought, 52-49 battle against 
USC in the 2016 Rose Bowl. A 
number of notable injuries and 
a questionable ejection surely 
sunk Penn State last September.

It seems eager to correct the 

record against the Wolverines 
this year.

Edge: Penn State
Prediction: 
Michigan 
10, 

Penn State 31

Junior running back Karan Higdon will face a steep challenge against the Nittany Lions, who currently boast the ninth-best overall defense in the country.

Notebook: Point guard competition nears end

With the season less than 

three weeks away, Michigan 
men’s basketball coach John 
Beilein has yet to name his 
starting point guard. At Big 
Ten Media Day on Thursday, 
though, Beilein admitted he is 
getting closer.

“It’s so competitive right 

now,” 
Beilein 
said. 
“The 

intensity 
is 
probably 
like 

nothing we’ve ever seen.”

Fifth-year senior point guard 

Jaaron Simmons transferred to 
Michigan instead of entering 
the 
NBA 
Draft 
under 
the 

assumption, presumably, that 
he would man the starting role 
come Nov. 11 against North 
Florida. And he very well may. 
But sophomore Zavier Simpson 
and freshman Eli Brooks are 
competing for the spot as 
well, and what once seemed 
inevitable for Simmons appears 
to be up for the taking.

Simpson’s minutes steadily 

increased last season in his 
role as the backup to Derrick 

Walton Jr., though his offensive 
production 
often 
sputtered, 

averaging just 1.6 points per 
game. Recruited as the heir to 
Walton’s throne, Simpson saw a 
wrench thrown in his potential 
breakout sophomore campaign 
with Simmons entering the 
program as a graduate transfer 
and Brooks shining early in 
practice. His defensive tenacity, 
as it did last season, will earn 
him minutes on a team seeking 
intensity on that end of the 
floor.

Youth may well be the only 

thing limiting Brooks at this 
point, as the buzz around his 
freshman season continues to 
churn. Talk of him starting is no 
longer purely hypothetical; he 
seems to be firmly in the mix, 
and will likely play a major role 
whether or not he is starting or 
coming off the bench. If history 
taught us anything with Trey 
Burke and Derrick Walton Jr., 
Beilein will not be afraid to 
start a freshman if he is ready.

Though he refused to hint 

at which way he was leaning, 
Beilein believes the “healthy” 
competition will ultimately be 
beneficial for the group as a 
whole. 

“This one is three guys 

going at it; it’s really tough to 
even decide because nobody’s 
making each other look good 
because the competition is 
so hard,” Beilein said. “It’ll 
be good for us when we play 
against other competition.”

Wolverines will face tough 

early opponents

“We maybe have the most 

challenging 
schedule 
that 

certainly I’ve ever had at 
Michigan or maybe Michigan’s 
ever had,” Beilein said in his 
opening statements Thursday.

Clearly 
the 
Wolverines’ 

tough schedule has been on 
his mind, and justifiably so. 
In 22 days — from Nov. 20 to 
Dec. 12 — Michigan will travel 
to Hawaii, Columbus, North 
Carolina and Texas, with home 
games against Indiana and 
UCLA sprinkled in between.

And then there’s the rest of 

the Big Ten schedule.

Since the Wolverines have a 

team that includes many new 
faces in important positions, 
it will be important for the 
experienced players to play 
well. Fifth-year senior forward 
Duncan Robinson said as much 
on Thursday. He recognizes the 

challenge as an opportunity for 
the older players to drive the 
team to success.

“A lot of these young guys are 

going to have to grow up quick,” 
Robinson said. “It’ll probably be 
on us, as the older guys, to kind 
of help push them through the 
adversity in those times.”

Beilein says this past month 

has been paramount in preparing 
for the upcoming schedule, 
saying that preparation now will 
allow the team an opportunity 
to spend time “off their feet” 
when they need to in the future. 

Two is better than one
John Beilein and Tom Izzo 

agree on one thing: Michigan 
and Michigan State should play 
each other twice a year.

For the 2017-18 season, the 

in-state rivalry will happen 
only once in East Lansing, but 
after a recent move by the Big 
Ten to expand conference play 
from 18 to 20 games, the home-
and-home matchup looks to 
be protected for the following 
season and near future.

“I think preserving rivalries 

that people have grown up on in 
this changing world was a very 
good move by the Big Ten,” Izzo 
said. “And I think it’s going to 
benefit a lot of us and hopefully 
it will catch fire around the 
country.”

Added 
Beilein: 
“There’s 

never a doubt in any way, shape 
or form. And it’s what should 
be happening. I think it’s the 
way that — it’s really smart 
scheduling for us. … It just makes 
so much sense, both interest-
wise, financially, the whole deal. 
It’s just like a great concept that 
we’ve both embraced.”

For the rest of the Big Ten, 

the move was intended to 
increase the frequency of other 
in-state rivalries and regional 
opponents. The change will 
likely boost the strength-of-
schedule across the conference 
as 
weaker 
non-conference 

games 
are 
replaced, 
which 

could have implications on 
NCAA 
Tournament 
seeding 

come March.

ICE HOCKEY
Yost Ice Arena rink 
named for Berenson

If Red Berenson’s name 

wasn’t already etched in the 
hallow halls of Yost Ice Arena 
years ago, his legacy will now 
forever 
be 
celebrated 
and 

cemented on the ice. 

The rink inside the arena 

is now “Red Berenson Rink,” 
honoring 
the 
legendary 

Michigan hockey coach of 33 
years who retired at the end of 
last season. The University’s 
Board of Regents unanimously 
approved the rink naming 
Thursday 
afternoon 
at 
its 

monthly meeting.

“Red Berenson is a legend 

in the sport of ice hockey, 
a 
tremendous 
educator 
of 

young 
men 
and 
someone 

who has made 
a 
significant 

impact 
at 
the 

University 
of 

Michigan,” said 
athletic director 
Warde 
Manuel 

in a statement. 
“He 
has 

dedicated much 
of 
his 
adult 

life to develop 
hundreds 
of 

young men here at Michigan. 
This is an honor befitting his 
exceptional commitment to 
intercollegiate athletics and 
his championship success in 
the sport of hockey as both a 
player and a coach.”

The 
new 
ice 
design 
— 

featuring Berenson’s signature 
near both blue lines — will be 
unveiled before Friday night’s 
home opener against Vermont, 
with a formal rink dedication 
on Jan. 5 when Michigan hosts 
Notre Dame. Next season, 
the words “Yost Ice Arena” in 
the center ice circle will be 
replaced with “Red Berenson 
Rink.”

A 
lifelong 
Wolverine, 

Berenson arrived in Ann Arbor 
as 
a 
student-athlete 
from 

Regina, Saskatchewan. The 
Canadian played four years 
of hockey and was named 
All-American twice, the 1962 
WCHA Most Valuable Player 
and a team captain his senior 
season. 
After 
graduation, 

Berenson played 17 years in 
the NHL as a member of the 
New York Rangers, St. Louis 
Blues, 
Detroit 
Red 
Wings 

and 
Montreal 
Canadiens. 

With 
Montreal, 
Berenson 

won Stanley Cups in 1965 and 
1966, 
while 
simultaneously 

earning a Master of Business 
Administration 
degree 
at 

Michigan.

After coaching in the NHL 

until 1984, Berenson returned 

to Ann Arbor as 
head coach and 
immediately 
revamped 
the 
hockey 

program 
into 

one of the most 
storied in the 
country. Under 
his leadership, 
Michigan 
captured 
21 

conference 

championships and made the 
NCAA Tournament in 23 of his 
last 27 seasons. From 1991 to 
2012, the Wolverines received 
22 straight tournament bids, 
a streak that still stands as 
an NCAA record. Berenson 
led Michigan to 11 Frozen 
Fours 
and 
two 
national 

championships in 1996 and 
1998.

Berenson retired with the 

fourth-most wins in NCAA ice 
hockey history with an 848-
426-92 career record. He also 
groomed two Hobey Baker 
Memorial Award winners, 73 
NHL players and 140 Academic 
All-Big Ten selections.

What to Watch For: No. 2 Penn State

This week’s focus is all on fifth-

year senior quarterback John 
O’Korn and the No. 19 Michigan 
football team’s offense. 

The Wolverines are No. 1 in 

total defense, but No. 98 in total 
offense. It’s clear where the 
problem lies.

Michigan (2-1 Big Ten, 5-1 

overall) scarcely beat Indiana last 
week and now faces a superior 
opponent in No. 2 Penn State (3-0, 
6-0).

Here’s what to watch for when 

the Wolverines take on Penn 
State this weekend as nine-point 
underdogs.

1. Can O’Korn connect with 

his receivers?

When O’Korn lit up Purdue, 

it seemed as if the then-backup 
quarterback would do just fine. 
But in two games since beating 
the Boilermakers, O’Korn has 
completed just 47 percent of his 

passes for 256 total yards and zero 
touchdowns.

He notably overthrew freshman 

receiver Donovon Peoples-Jones 
on a wide-open go route last week. 
That is not only a pass that he is 
expected to make, but a type of 
pass that Speight had been able 
to before he got injured. O’Korn 
admitted this week that he needs 
to hit those open receivers.

If he can land just two or three 

passes in the 20 to 30-yard range 
— which he couldn’t against 
Indiana — it will force Penn State’s 
secondary to play back a bit, which 
should help open the Wolverines’ 
run game as well.

2. How far can the running 

backs carry the Wolverines?

Junior running back Karan 

Higdon stole the show against the 
Hoosiers, but all season long, the 
running back trio — which also 
includes fifth-year senior Ty Isaac 
and sophomore Chris Evans — has 
been the backbone of Michigan’s 
offense. Higdon leads the team 
with five rushing touchdowns, 
and Evans and Isaac trail him 
with two and one, respectively.

Michigan has depth at running 

back and a handful of nifty plays in 
its back pocket. Sophomore receiver 
Eddie McDoom contributes with 
his jet sweeps, fifth-year senior 
Khalid Hill consistently gets the 

short gains and even the highly 
anticipated 
redshirt 
freshman 

running back Kareem Walker got 
into the mix against Indiana.

But Penn State surely knows 

all of this and will be prepared to 
stop the run. If the Nittany Lions 
pack the line of scrimmage with 
players, then only time will tell 
how far all these running backs 
can really go.

3. Was the offensive line’s 

performance against Indiana a 
one-time thing?

Michigan’s offensive line played 

an all-around consistent game for 
the first time against the Hoosiers. 
The question is whether or not the 
offensive line can hold up again.

With the left side of the line 

sured up by senior tackle Mason 
Cole and sophomore guard Ben 
Bredeson, the fate falls on redshirt 
junior right tackle Juwann Bushell-
Beatty and sophomore right guard 
Michael Onwenu. Bushell-Beatty 
started last weekend and played 
the entire game.

Pass protection was better than 

ever, as O’Korn wasn’t sacked 
— the first time this year that a 
Michigan quarterback didn’t get 
taken down.

Indiana’s 
defensive 
line, 

though, is likely not as threatening 
as Penn State’s. The Nittany Lions 
have accumulated 17 sacks and 51 

total tackles for loss this year.

Can 
Michigan’s 
offensive 

line keep up with Penn State’s 
aggressive defense? We’ll find out 
on Saturday.

4. Switching it up. You know 

about Barkley and McSorley, 
but keep an eye on these other 
players for Penn State’s offense.

Wide 
receiver 
DaeSean 

Hamilton has been the beneficiary 
of quarterback Trace McSorley’s 
relentless throwing arm over the 
past few years, and the trend has 
continued into this season.

The fifth-year senior averages 61 

receiving yards per game, and has 
four touchdown catches. Behind 
running back Saquon Barkley, 
Hamilton should be McSorley’s 
next 
most-targeted 
receiver. 

Finally, with an average of 16.6 
yards per catch, Hamilton often 
finds himself on the receiving 
end of some of McSorley’s biggest 
throws.

Tight end Mike Gesicki also 

has four receiving touchdowns 
for Penn State this year and has 
amassed a total of 176 receiving 
yards. Gesicki stands tall at 6-foot-
6, which should be a big red flag for 
Michigan’s undersized backfield.

McSorley and Barkley are the 

Nittany Lions’ biggest playmakers, 
but Gesicki and Hamilton can be 
just as dangerous.

Behind Enemy Lines: Penn State beat writer Jill Beckman

For Michigan, it all comes down 

to this.

Win on the road against No. 

2 Penn State, and the College 
Football Playoff is still in sight. 

Lose?
Well, that outcome is much less 

rosy.

The 
Wolverines 
will 
enter 

Happy Valley on Saturday night 
as the underdogs for the first time 
all year. It’ll be their biggest test 
of the season so far — the Nittany 
Lions boast the nation’s top scoring 
defense and have a high-powered 
offense led by running back Saquon 
Barkley, an early contender for the 
Heisman Trophy.

The 
Michigan 
Daily 
spoke 

with Jill Beckman of The Daily 
Collegian and Philly Inquirer 
ahead of this week’s game about 
Barkley, Penn State’s defense and 
what it will take for the Wolverines 
to pull off an upset.

TMD: “I really want to hear 

your thoughts on this team this 
year. 6-0, (ranked) No. 2 — what’s 
impressed you the most so far?”

JB: “Yeah, you’re right, the 

undefeated 
record 
is 
really 

impressive, but also they haven’t 
had too much of a test so far. 
They’ve had some challenging Big 
Ten opponents but this three-game 
stretch is going to be the hardest of 
the season. What’s impressed me 
the most, obviously, (running back) 
Saquon (Barkley) is being Saquon. 
Franklin said that we’re going to 
see some new tricks from him the 
second half of the season. I think 
they were saving some big things 
for him, so I don’t think we’ve 
seen his full potential yet. And 
then our defense has been looking 
really good. Yeah, I would say 
right now, the defense and I think 
(quarterback) Trace McSorley have 
been impressing. His numbers 
have improved a little bit since last 
year, but the offensive line has been 
struggling so he hasn’t looked as 
good as he possibly could, but I still 
think he’s a solid quarterback.”

TMD: “Yeah, so I noticed 

Barkley has been held under 100 
yards rushing for four out of the 
six games this year. How have 
teams really been able to stop him? 
Have they been loading up the box, 
or has it just been the offensive 
line unable to block six or seven 
people?”

JB: “I think the offensive line is 

to blame completely. They haven’t 
been looking good, and we’ve been 
seeing Trace being sacked a number 
of times per game, and they’re 
containing Saquon. That’ll be a 
struggle too this weekend. I think 
it’ll be the biggest test basically on 
both ends — if Michigan’s defense 
can contain Saquon, that shows a 
lot from them and then if Saquon 
can get past the best defense in the 
country, then that shows a lot from 
Penn State’s offense. So I think 
it’ll be a test on both ends but the 
offensive line has been Penn State’s 
biggest struggle right now.”

TMD: “That Iowa game — close 

call, but Penn State had nearly 600 
yards of offense. I don’t think that’s 
quite sustainable for teams to try to 
upset, if they’re getting outgained 
like 600 to 273. What would you 
say is the more realistic path to an 
upset for Michigan?”

JB: “I mean, it’s going to be them 

playing really solid on defense. I just 
don’t think, from what we’ve seen, 
that their offense will be able to 
put up a lot of points this weekend. 
I just don’t see that happening. So 
I think the way to the upset will 
be containing Saquon and the rest 
of the offense, getting to Trace 
because, like I said, the OL hasn’t 
been looking good. Yeah, scoring 
as many points as you can against 
Penn State’s defense — which isn’t 
easy — but I think the key to a 
Michigan upset would be showing 
that their defense is as good as it’s 
been all year, as good as people say 
it is.”

TMD: “Another big part of that 

Penn State offense is (tight end) 
Mike Gesicki. He had those four 
touchdowns in the first two weeks, 
but it seems like he’s really slowed 
down in production in the four 
games since. What have teams 
been throwing at him to stop him? 

Is it something where teams are 
focusing so hard on Gesicki that 
Penn State’s spreading the ball 
to the outside receivers, or is it 
something where Penn State just 
needs to get him going at some 
point?”

JB: “I think teams have noticed 

that he makes the big plays once in 
awhile. He’s not going to be that guy 
every time, but he makes those big 
plays here and there, and they’ve 
noticed that. Gesicki wasn’t always 
this good, he had a few pretty bad 
seasons, and all of a sudden now, 
he’s this really great player. So I 
think Penn State, like you said, is 
trying to spread the ball out more 
because opponents are starting to 
pick up on that.”

TMD: “You talked earlier about 

that defense. Michigan’s pretty 
highly-touted, but Penn State is 
No. 1 in scoring defense right now 
— what has stood out to you about 
Penn State’s defense so far?”

JB: “A lot has stood out. They’re 

getting a lot of turnovers, which 
is a key part, and then you have a 
lot of guys who are really versatile 
and they’re making those big 
plays and if they get the ball on 
defense, they’re going to go score 
a touchdown. You’re seeing a lot of 
those big plays. It’s actually funny 
because at practice yesterday, 
(defensive end) Shareef Miller, he 
… basically said, ‘They’re acting 
like we’re nothing but we’re going 
to show them who the best defense 
is Saturday.’ I think that was it. So I 
mean, they can do a lot more. They 
can score. That’s going to be huge.”

TMD: “On defense, what has 

been the most impressive unit to 
you so far? I know last year, I think 
Garrett Sickels is gone, he was that 
defensive end that was pretty good. 
Linebackers, cornerbacks, who has 
stood out to you so far on defense?”

JB: “You have Marcus Allen, 

he’s been really impressing. He’s 
a safety. You have Jason Cabinda 
at middle linebacker, he’s been 
consistent the past few years. 
He’s always been solid. That’s a 
good question — there’s so many. 
I would say asides from those two, 
(cornerback) Grant Haley, he’s 

been really impressive. He just 
got named to some Watch List or 
Award List or something. Shareef 
Miller has been good. I think those 
guys are the key pieces.”

TMD: 
“Looking 
at 
special 

teams, Tyler Davis the kicker last 
year put up elite numbers, 22-of-24, 
this year under 50 percent, what 
has gone wrong with him so far?”

JB: “That’s a good question. I 

think we’re all kind of wondering 
the same thing. Last year, he was so 
impressive. I don’t know that I have 
the answer for you, to be honest.”

TMD: “Are they going to bring 

in another kicker, or is this his 
job? Is it just his job until they find 
someone else, I’m not really sure 
who else they have on the roster.”

JB: “I don’t think they have 

much depth at that position, as far 
as I know. It’s just going to be him 
unless something changes. To be 
honest, I can’t tell you what’s gone 
wrong with him. It was such a 
dramatic decrease in production 
from him. Last year, everyone was 
raving about him. This year, the 
stats are just not looking good at all 
for him.”

TMD: “It seems like that’s one 

area that’s a little under-discussed 
when it comes to Penn State, 

because you look at the offense, 
McSorley, Barkley, Gesicki. But 
it could really hurt them in big 
games, right, because against Iowa, 
two-point victory and he missed 
two field goals — you wouldn’t even 
have needed that touchdown if he 
had made those, right?”

JB: “Yeah, definitely. And I 

think asides from Tyler Davis’s 
drop in production, I think the 
special teams unit has actually 
been really solid. Even this week, 
James Franklin actually said the 
special teams unit has had the best 
two days of practice that they’ve 
had since he became coach at 
Penn State. So they made some 
tweaks, I guess, so maybe we’ll see 
some better stuff from them this 
weekend. But that was something 
that stood out in my mind, for 
sure.”

TMD: “And then to wrap 

things up — it really seems, in the 
past few years and maybe even 
before that, that this has taken on 
a new meaning, the game between 
these two teams. Would you see 
it as a rivalry, maybe, on par with 
Michigan-MSU, Michigan-OSU, or 
do you think it’s still on its way to 
getting there?”

JB: “Looking at it right now, 

obviously all three of those teams 
are ranked now, and at this point 
last year, we definitely could not 
say that Penn State is on the same 
level as those two teams. After that 
Michigan game last year, Penn 
State-Michigan, it was a disaster 
for Penn State. But now they’re 
definitely on that level. I’d say that, 
yeah, they’re definitely rivals now 
because it’s a competition. It’s not 
obvious that Michigan’s going to 
beat Penn State or it’s not even 
obvious that Ohio State’s going to 
beat Penn State. So I would say it’s 
a rivalry because they’re all playing 
at a really high level.”

TMD: “Because it just seems 

like, in the week leading up to the 
game, from both sides there’s been 
a little different atmosphere when 
the players and coaches have been 
talking about this matchup in 
particular.”

JB: “Obviously, Michigan and 

Ohio State, those Big Ten teams 
have always been, at least recently, 
our biggest games, but Penn State 
wasn’t at the level of a Michigan 
or Ohio State the past few years. 
So it’s definitely different this year 
now that Penn State’s ranked No. 2 
right now. The Big Ten East is just 
so good right now.”

of college hockey
during Michigan’s 
2017-18 campaign.

STAFF PICKS


One step at a time

T

hree weeks ago this Saturday, 
the Michigan hockey team 
left the ice at Yost Ice Arena 

having posted a 60-shot, double-digit 
scoring spectacle in its preseason 
faceoff with 
Western 
Ontario. Elation 
was palpable 
as the players 
and coaches 
filed into the 
locker room, but 
hints of relief 
and surprise 
permeated the 
air as well. 

Michigan 

coach Mel Pearson was quick to 
address the elephant in the room.

“The goal scoring,” Pearson said, 

“we were 42nd in offense last year, 
so we weren’t sure where the goals 
were going to come from.”

And yet, nine of the Wolverines’ 

10 goals came from players who were 
on the roster last season. Plainly, 
such a large margin of victory could 
not have been anticipated.

Fast forward one week.
Michigan began its regular season 

on a New York road trip, where 
its emerging offense outshot St. 
Lawrence in the Friday nightcap and 
Clarkson on Saturday. Yet while the 
Wolverines tallied a win against the 
Saints, their Saturday battle went 
down on paper as an inerasable 
shutout loss.

Therein lies the point of reflection. 

Should losses like the one to Clarkson 
be taken at face value, or should they 
actually be interpreted as triumphs 
within themselves? There may not be 
one clear answer yet.

Inarguably though, the 

Wolverines demonstrated growth 
in both of their opening outings. 
Michigan, both nights, created viable 
opportunities for itself. Michigan, 
both nights, had its offense outshine 
that of the opposition. The same 
could not be said for most of last 
season.

When the weekend wrapped up, 

Pearson echoed this viewpoint.

“In some regards, we played 

better (against Clarkson) than we 
played (against St. Lawrence),” he 
said. “And some nights the puck just 
doesn’t go in the net for you.”

The elaborate, tiny details of 

each game will never be captured 
completely on a stats sheet. But that 

doesn’t make them trivial.

And this year, winning games 

shouldn’t be the sole emphasis 
for Michigan. Let me be clear: It’s 
not that winning isn’t important, 
or that the Wolverines won’t be 
capable of beating a multitude of 
their opponents. But chiefly, the 
transformation of this program 
won’t happen overnight.

Still, every small improvement 

displays the charisma Pearson 
has brought back to Michigan 
hockey. Every development 
prognosticates the program’s 
future success.

No one wanted to focus on the 

preseason poll that predicted the 
Wolverines would finish second to 
last in the Big Ten. On Media Day, 
players collectively expressed that 
they aren’t letting it get to them, and 
that they are determined to prove the 
poll wrong.

“It was a little bit of a topic of 

conversation,” said senior forward 
Dexter Dancs. “But, you know what, 
we’re not looking too much into it. 
But it will definitely be in the back of 
our mind when we play every team 
this year.”

Despite how disheartening the 

forecast of finishing sixth out of 
seven seems, it was anything but 
arbitrary.

Michigan’s 6-12-2 conference 

mark over the 2016-17 season says 
as much. The Wolverines had the 
third-worst Corsi-percentage — a 
measure of puck possesion and shot 
differentials — in the country. The 
offense completely broke down, 
and was never able to regenerate. 
Michigan commenced the year with 
a No. 11 ranking, but it quickly faded, 
slipping to 37th in the nation by the 
end of the season.

In contrast, No. 5 Notre Dame, No. 

8 Minnesota and No. 11 Penn State 
all earned NCAA Tournament bids 
last spring. These three conference 
competitors, in addition to No. 6 
Wisconsin, are all ranked above 
Michigan, and rightfully so.

With an elite hockey tradition, 

a new coach and a revamped 
mentality, the Wolverines are eager 
to write off last season as a glitch and 
move forward. But commanding a 
high-caliber conference like the Big 
Ten is an ambitious feat for anyone, 
and Michigan sits only a week away 
from its conference opener against 
the Nittany Lions.

This team is going to have to be 

patient. All of the adjustments the 
Wolverines hope to make will not 
happen in a month, in a season or 
even in two. The bulk of the roster 
returns from last year, and the 
learning curve will be steep. But 
in the case of Michigan — a team 
aiming for complete reinvention — 
time is its friend.

“It’s a process,” Pearson said after 

the Wolverines’ opening weekend. 
“And it’s going to be a process with 
this team.”

And who better than Pearson — a 

coach extremely familiar to working 
with struggling programs — to guide 
Michigan through this process?

Pearson embarked on his 

journey as head coach at his alma 
mater, Michigan Tech, in 2011. He 
joined a program that hadn’t seen 
a NCAA tournament appearance 
since 1981.

Just a season before he arrived, 

the Huskies held a 4-30-4 overall 
record. Rebuilding the team to bring 
it national relevance once again was 
a daunting task. And yet, with time, 
Pearson proved it feasible. 

Development started out on 

a smaller scale, with gradual 

improvements year to year. 
Michigan Tech didn’t see a 
winning record until the 2014-15 
season. But that same season, the 
Huskies notched their first-ever 
No. 1 ranking and netted an NCAA 
Tournament bid.

Obviously, the two circumstances 

are not the same. Michigan Tech 
hadn’t been hot for decades. 
Michigan had one bad year. But 
the Huskies are an unmistakable 
case of how a new set of skilled eyes 
and a little bit of time can revamp a 
program.

Thirty games — almost a full 

season — remain ahead of the 
Wolverines. Michigan should focus 
now on what it can control.

The offense is alive. Team 

chemistry is high. Newcomers 
are finding a groove and making 
contributions. The coach at the helm 
has experience working with teams 
and building their programs from 
the ground floor.

The rest, with time, will fall into 

place.

First-year head coach Mel Pearson is no stranger to rebuilding a program, but in the case of the Michigan hockey team, it won’t be a process that happens overnight.

The arrival of Mel Pearson has injected new life into the program, but his renaissance will require patience.

Mel Pearson: A home with a history

When Mel Pearson was hired as 

head coach of the Michigan hockey 
team, it almost seemed preordained.

Of course, nothing in life is that 

simple. But Pearson’s accomplishments 
with the Wolverines — 22 years as an 
assistant coach under the legendary Red 
Berenson, 11 Frozen Four appearances 
and 
two 
national 
championships 

included — are impossible to ignore.

The history of Michigan hockey is a 

long and storied one. It’s a history that 
Pearson takes great pride in. So while 
it may not have been destined, Pearson 
and Michigan are clearly a perfect 
match.

And now, after six years as the head 

coach at Michigan Tech, Pearson is 
back in Ann Arbor once again, tasked 
with reviving the program he helped 
build.

“I owe a lot to Michigan,” Pearson 

said. “And it’s my job to make sure we 
keep this program up and running and 
in the national spotlight.”

***

Pearson credits his father, also 

named Mel, for instilling him with his 
passion for hockey. The elder Pearson 
played professionally for 16 seasons 
with 12 different teams.

“I was at the rink with him a lot 

growing up,” Pearson said. “And I 
really fell in love and had a fascination 
for the game.”

The Pearson family called Flin Flon, 

Manitoba — a mining town of about 
10,000 where Pearson’s father had also 
grown up — home. But being the son 
of a professional athlete also meant 

moving around to many different cities, 
an experience that was formative for 
Pearson’s childhood.

“I remember I grew up a big 

Baltimore Orioles fan, they had some 
great teams back then,” Pearson said. “I 
lived in L.A. and still remember going 
to Dodger games and whatnot. You 
meet a lot of neat people, and to this 
day I still have friends I met in L.A., 
Baltimore and Portland.”

In 1973, Pearson’s father’s playing 

days came to an end with the 
Minnesota Fighting Saints of the World 
Hockey Association. It was there that 
Pearson played high school hockey, 
at Edina High School, and also there 
that Pearson’s connection to Michigan 
can be traced back to. His high school 
coach, Willard Ikola, won national 
championships in 1951 and 1952 as 
an All-American goaltender for the 
Wolverines, and encouraged Pearson to 
consider attending Michigan.

Instead, Pearson decided to play 

at Michigan Tech, because he felt 
more comfortable with the school and 
program. Under legendary coach John 
MacInnes, who coincidentally was 
also a Michigan alum, the Huskies had 
recently made three straight Frozen 
Four appearances, winning a national 
championship in 1975.

“I grew up in a small town, and 

I knew a couple people on the team 
already,” Pearson said. “Michigan Tech 
at that time, the program was doing 
better than Michigan was. I felt it was a 
great hockey school and a place where I 
could get a great education.”

Pearson, who played in 97 games in 

four years at Michigan Tech and scored 
56 points, states that he “wasn’t what 

you would call a great player” in college. 
Instead, he described his playing 
style as a “good, honest player” and a 
“worker”. But Pearson’s college career 
had no shortage of memorable moments 
— the Huskies appeared in the Frozen 
Four in 1981 and won four straight Great 
Lakes Invitational championships. In 
fact, Pearson’s biggest goal came in the 
1979 Invitational against Michigan, 
a tournament-winning goal in triple 
overtime which he described simply as 
“pretty cool”.

In the second half of his senior 

year, Pearson began to think about 
coaching for the first time. Up until 

that point, he had envisioned himself 
as having the potential to be a minor-
league journeyman for a few years. But 
with MacInnes’s retirement looming, 
assistants Jim Nahrgang and Herb 
Boxer approached Pearson about the 
possibility of coaching, and when 
Nahrgang took over for MacInnes in 
1982, Pearson was part of his initial 
staff.

“That piqued my interest because 

I love the game,” Pearson said. “You 
don’t have a job, it’s like a hobby. If you 
can find something that you love and 
enjoy doing, and you can do it for pretty 
much your whole life, then you’ve been 
pretty lucky and fortunate.”

***

Two years after Pearson took his 

first college coaching job, Red Berenson 
became the head coach of the Michigan 
hockey team.

Four years later, Pearson also found 

himself in Ann Arbor, interviewing for 
a position on Berenson’s staff.

Pearson and Berenson were familiar 

with each other. Pearson’s father had 
played with Berenson on a number 
of All-Star teams, and Pearson and 
Berenson had interacted with each 
other while recruiting. But that didn’t 
make the experience any less daunting 
for Pearson.

“I felt pretty comfortable around 

him,” Pearson said. “But I remember 
my interview down here, that was 
probably the scariest thing. I remember 
Red taking me up to Bo Schembechler’s 
office, because Bo Schembechler was 
the athletic director at the time. Red 
can be pretty intimidating, and then to 
go up and there you are and you have 
Red on one side and Bo on the other 
side looking at you, that can be pretty 

nervewracking.”

Of course, this was well before 

Berenson had built a dynasty. The 
Wolverines were on the upswing after 
having gone 22-19 in 1988, but that had 
been preceded by three straight seasons 
of 14 wins or less. So from the outset, 
Pearson’s focus was on strengthening 
the program through recruiting.

It was also under Berenson that 

Pearson’s coaching style began to 
emerge. In fact, Pearson heavily credits 
Berenson for actively facilitating that 
development.

“One thing about Coach Berenson 

that’s great is that he gives his assistants 
a lot of responsibility to get involved 
with all the aspects of coaching,” 
Pearson said. “From pregame scouting 
to postgame scouting to working 
on individual skills with players to 
working on the power play, so we had a 
lot of responsibility.”

Added Michigan assistant coach Bill 

Muckalt, who played for Berenson and 
Pearson from 1994 to 1998: “Obviously 
they both have great track records, 
they both have a tremendous amount 
of success in coaching. Red’s had a 
tremendous influence on Mel, they 
both coached together for a long time 
and when you do that you pick up a lot 
of the same traits.”

Berenson’s influence can also be seen 

in the aggressive, fast-paced offensive 
style that Pearson has attempted to 
bring to the Wolverines this season, 
mirroring the same goals Berenson 
and Pearson set for the team 30 years 
earlier.

“We always talked that we wanted 

to play up-tempo,” Pearson said. “We’re 
in the entertainment business — now 
coach Berenson didn’t talk about that

per se, but we are in the entertainment 
business. You want people to come 
into the building and be entertained 
and enjoy their experience here, and 
so we wanted to put a quick, fast, high-
energy, high-scoring team together.”

Those efforts were soon fulfilled. In 

1991, Michigan qualified for the NCAA 
Tournament for the first time in 14 
years, and stormed into the Frozen 
Four the next year. The dynasty was 
up and running, as the Wolverines 
made six Frozen Four appearances 
and won two national titles between 
1992 and 1998, finishing among the 
top three teams in the country in goals 
scored each of those years. Three 
times, a Wolverine was the leading 
points-scorer in the NCAA — Denny 
Felsner in 1992 and Brendan Morrison 
in 1996 and 1998.

With 
this 
success 
came 
the 

possibility of a head coaching job 
for Pearson — most notably, Miami 
of Ohio offered him the position 
in 1999. But through all Pearson’s 
years at Michigan, being just an 
assistant coach never weighed on 
him, as Berenson gave him and other 
assistants so much responsibility that 
“you felt like a co-coach.”

“I remember talking to Red and 

I think Tom Goss was the Athletic 
Director at the time, and talked to 
Lloyd Carr, the former football coach,” 
Pearson said of declining Miami’s 
offer. “Because Lloyd stayed here for a 
long time and really didn’t have to go 
away to become a head coach, and he 
(asked), ‘Why make two moves if you 
don’t have to make any?’

“I always said back in the day I 

didn’t have to become a head coach 
to feel like I (had accomplished 
anything) as a coach, because we had 
touched so many players. But I love 
Michigan so much too, it (was) hard to 
consider leaving.”

***

Berenson had once told Pearson 

that he wouldn’t be coaching at 60. 
But Berenson turned 71 during the 
2011 season, and it was obvious he 
wouldn’t coach forever — although 
Pearson says it sometimes seemed 
that way. According to Pearson, then-
athletic director Dave Brandon was 
open about the situation.

“(He) said, ‘If Red leaves you’d 

be a good candidate, but there’s no 
guarantees,’” Pearson said, “‘and if 
you go out and get head coaching 
experience and do a good job, you’d 
probably be a better candidate.’”

The opportunity to do so came in 

2011, but it came a little too soon for 
Pearson. Just four days after Michigan 
had lost in the national championship 
game, a 3-2 overtime defeat to 
Minnesota-Duluth, Michigan Tech 
offered him its vacant head-coaching 
position.

“I get that they wanted to make 

sure they get somebody quick before 
the season was too far over,” Pearson 
said. “(But) after you lose like that it’s 
gut-wrenching. It was an emotional 
time. You just lost the national 

championship. That sticks with you; 
it still sticks with me now. So if you 
can imagine them saying, ‘We need an 
answer within 48 hours or so,’ I just 
wasn’t ready.”

With time, though, the heartbreak 

of that defeat began to subside, and 
Pearson was prepared to make the 
move. In May 2011, he became the 
Huskies’ head coach, and went to 
work rebuilding a team that had gone 
4-30-1 the previous season.

“(It was) challenging at times, 

because you’re learning on the job 
too,” Pearson said. “You’re not sure 
if you’re doing the right things at the 
time. It’s easy to question yourself, 
but I had a great staff and we really 
believed that we knew that we could 
change things. Having come from a 
place like Michigan and how they run 
things, I think I was very well schooled 
by Coach Berenson and Michigan and 
even Coach MacInnes from Michigan 
Tech and Coach Ikola from high 
school — three Michigan men. Great 
coaching, great philosophies, great 
systems.

“There was nowhere to go but up 

— they’d only won 15 games in the 
previous three years. But there were 
some good pieces there, I think they 
just needed direction and leadership.”

Pearson hired two of his former 

star players at Michigan — Muckalt 
and Steve Shields — as assistant 
coaches. And just as he did with the 
Wolverines, 
Pearson 
emphasized 

tenacious recruiting to turn the 
Huskies around.

“We got young men up to Michigan 

Tech that had our vision and fit our 
style of play that we knew that we 
could win with. That was the biggest 
thing,” Pearson said. “Slowly but 
surely, as you start winning you 
attract better recruits. I remember the 
first few days, you’d say you’re from 
Michigan Tech and they’d hang up 
right away.”

However, the recruits that Pearson 

did sign often found success. Muckalt 
attested to Pearson’s ability to connect 
with players and help them reach their 
fullest potential.

“One of Mel’s greatest strengths 

is the ability to get the most out of 
everyone,” Muckalt said. “He’s not a 
yeller or a screamer, but finds a way 
to get them to respond to help the 
team.”

And as Pearson’s recruiting classes 

took shape, Michigan Tech took off. In 
2014, the Huskies earned their first-
ever No. 1 national ranking, winning 
29 games that season, and qualified 
for the NCAA Tournament twice in 
three seasons.

Despite this success — or maybe as 

a result of it — speculation continued 
to 
run 
rampant 
about 
Pearson 

being a candidate at Michigan after 
Berenson’s 
retirement. 
Pearson 

doesn’t downplay the impact that 
it had, especially when it came to 
recruiting, even though he remained 
fully committed to Michigan Tech.

“It was a distraction at times 

because when you’re recruiting, first 
question that came up with recruits 
(was): ‘How long are you going to 
be here? Are you interested in the 
Michigan job?’” Pearson said. “There 
were no guarantees. I wasn’t sure if I’d 
ever come back to Michigan. I thought 
Michigan Tech was going to be my last 
job.

“It was hard right from the get go. 

Day one. Your name was associated 
with that just because of the number 
of years I’ve spent at Michigan and the 
amount of success that we all had here 
together.”

***

When Berenson retired in April, it 

set off what Pearson calls a “crazy” 
two weeks.

“Crazy 
in 
the 
sense 
that 

everybody just associated myself 
with the job,” Pearson said. “I 
hadn’t talked to anybody. Anybody 
at Michigan. Even Coach Berenson. 
After a while it gets to be a little bit 
of a nuisance.”

There’s a clear reason for that 

“craziness”, 
however. 
There’s 
no 

doubt that people view Pearson as a 
‘Michigan Man’, having helped build 
one of the most prestigious programs 
in college hockey. And when Pearson 
was officially hired, it surprised no 
one.

“Mel’s a great choice,” Muckalt 

said. “He’s earned it and been here 
a long time and had a lot of success 
and proven himself as a head coach. 
Obviously it’s a great progression for 
Michigan.”

It wasn’t all about hockey, though 

— sentimental reasons also drew 
Pearson back to Ann Arbor.

“I had 23 great years here,” Pearson 

said. “Lot of fond memories here — 
not just hockey memories. Whether 
it’s football and being in the stadium, 
watching Charles Woodson run the 
punt back against Ohio State or all the 
great sporting events, or being here 
when Michigan won its first softball 
national 
championship, 
basketball 

winning the national championship 
when I was an assistant coach here. 
Just the people 
of Ann Arbor, the 

town itself, the 
university. 
The 

University 
of 
Michigan. All my 

children 
went 
to Michigan.”

After 
Pearson officially 

became 
Michigan’s 

head 
coach, 
it 
became 
even 

more 
hectic. 
Due to the nature 

of 
college 
athletics, 
the 

constant 
recruiting 

cycle 
and 
the 
pressures 

of 
having 
to 
find a place to 

live, 
Pearson 
wasn’t 
afforded 

any 
initial 
acclimation 

period or time 
to relax — “My golf 

game suffered”, 
he jokes — but he 

says that it was 
a time he “sort of 

enjoyed”.

“You have to 
get straight into it,” 

Pearson 
said. 
“It’s 
right 
from 

contacting 
all 
the players that 

were currently 
here, 
contacting 

the recruits just 
to make sure they 

were 
still 
on 
board and there 

was a place for them here and they felt 
comfortable with me. Then you jump 
right into the recruiting. It’s 24/7, 365 
now. Not many days where you have a 
down day.”

Of course, Pearson is no stranger to 

this. It’s his drive and work ethic that 
helped turn Michigan and Michigan 
Tech into powerhouses. It’s those 
same qualities that he hopes to apply 
to a young, raw but talented Wolverine 
roster this year.

So far, Michigan appears to be 

receptive to both Pearson and his new 
staff’s demeanor and coaching style.

“(Pearson and Muckalt are) super 

excited to be here,” sophomore 
forward Jake Slaker said. “They’re 
Michigan men and they always 
wanted to be here. Now that they got 
the jobs they couldn’t be more excited 
to be here. Their energy levels are high 
every day, they love to come to work, 
which makes it easier on us because 
we love to come to work as well.”

Added 
sophomore 
goalkeeper 

Hayden 
Lavigne: 
“It’s 
definitely 

different, in a good way. Coach Mel is 
very enthusiastic and very upbeat and 
I think the guys are responding well 
to that.”

But in Pearson’s own words, he’s 

not here to create any legacy of his 
own. For him, it’s about the past — 
upholding the tradition that spans 
back from Berenson, to Al Renfrew, 
Vic Heyliger and countless other 
Michigan greats.

“I’m just the gatekeeper here,” 

Pearson says. “I just make sure 
we keep things in order and keep 
Michigan hockey in the national 
spotlight where it should be.”

Pearson knows the task of replacing 

a legend presents a challenge unlike 
any he has ever faced. He knows he 
isn’t the next Red Berenson, and he’s 
not trying to be.

What matters to Pearson, though, is 

that he’s at home.

Roster breakdown: Competition open
between pipes, youth could boost ‘M’

Coming 
off 
major 

disappointment and a losing 
record for the first time since 
2012-13, the Michigan hockey 
team seeks to rebound in a 
huge way this season, with 
expectations of an immense 
turnaround 
for 
the 
storied 

program. 
The 
Wolverines 

return an impressive 21 players 
looking to step up in leadership 
roles on and off the ice, and 
welcome 
six 
highly-touted 

newcomers determined to make 
an immediate impact. 

With a new head coach and 

fresh offensive and defensive 
systems, there will be trial and 
error as the season continues 

to unravel. But over the first 
two 
games, 
Michigan 
has 

already started to show signs of 
renewed and reenergized play, 
putting more shots on goal and 
tightening its defense.

The Daily takes an in-depth 

look at the Wolverine roster by 
position, 
deciphering 
which 

goaltender 
will 
be 
named 

starter, 
which 
veterans 
are 

primed to perform to potential 
and which freshmen could claim 
instant stardom.

Goaltenders

Michigan coach Mel Pearson 

has stated he isn’t one to rely on a 
goaltender rotation throughout 
a season.

Nonetheless, until a definitive 

starter 
emerges, 
sophomores 

Jack LaFontaine and Hayden 
Lavigne will continue to mind 
the net by committee, competing 
for the eventual starting role. 
At the onset, Pearson said they 
will split playing the first eight 
games, after which he plans to 
confidently announce a go-to 
goalie for the remainder of the 
season.

Either LaFontaine or Lavigne 

— the two goalies on the 
team with considerable game 
experience — will have large 
skates to fill. They replace last 
year’s third head of the three-
man goaltender rotation and 
team leader Zach Nagelvoort, 
who 
graduated 
last 
spring. 

Nagelvoort ended with a 33-26-
6 career record, a .917 save 

percentage — the second highest 
in Michigan history — and a 2.56 
goals against average, the sixth-
lowest in program history.

Last season, both LaFontaine 

and 
Lavigne 
saw 
almost 

identical 
action, 
but 
posted 

vastly different records while 
playing intermittently between 
Nagelvoort. LaFontaine entered 
11 games and went 1-7-1 with 
a 3.34 goals against average, 
while Lavigne finished 6-6-1 
and allowed 2.92 goals per game 
in 13 games.

But the tides may have turned 

this year. With the starting job 
still up for grabs, LaFontaine 
may hold the early edge. He 
led the Wolverines against St. 
Lawrence, allowing only one 
goal on 24 shots in a 3-1 victory. 

The following night, Lavigne 
didn’t have the same fortune, 
giving up three goals on 19 shots 
in a 3-0 loss to Clarkson.

While a clear frontrunner 

for the starting position has yet 
to materialize, once Pearson’s 
eight-game benchmark elapses, 
he will determine which goalie 
has risen to the occasion and 
can supplant Nagelvoort this 
season.

Forwards

After 
a 
season 
in 
which 

Michigan held the nation’s third-
worst Corsi-percentage — which 
measures shot differentials and 
puck possession — there are 
many promising aspects at the 
forward position to improve 
those numbers.

The sophomore class returns 

four forwards, headlined by Will 
Lockwood and Jake Slaker. Last 
year’s team MVP, Lockwood 
will be at full health following 
an offseason shoulder surgery. 
Despite missing five games last 
season, the speedy skater racked 
up eight goals and 12 assists for 
20 points, all second-highest 
marks on the team. Slaker was 
the backbone of the Michigan 
offense, playing in all 35 games 
as a freshman and posting a 
team-high 21 points.

While 
returning 
a 
solid 

corps of sophomores spread 
throughout line configurations, 
a major loss is Alex Kile. The 
former team captain provided 
point production during his four 
years, totaling 78 points on 39 
goals and 39 assists.

Tony Calderone will try to 

replace Kile in the veteran role 
and was named team captain 
Thursday. The senior forward 
started 
this 
season 
strong, 

netting two goals and one assist 
in the 10-1 rout over Western 
Ontario in an exhibition game 
and one goal on seven shots in 
the first two regular season 
contests. After recording 20 and 
18 points as a sophomore and 
junior, respectively, Calderone

will add much-needed team 
leadership during his final 
crusade. Senior Dexter Dancs 
and junior Brendan Warren 
also figure to be offensive 
catalysts after disappointing 
drop offs last season compared 
to previous years.

The answer to more shots 

on goal is likely tied to a 
group of highly ranked first-
year players. Five of the six 
are forwards, and the most 
anticipated arrival is freshman 
Josh Norris. Selected by the 
San Jose Sharks as the 19th 
overall pick in the first round 
of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, 
he played the past two seasons 
with the United States National 
Team Development Program 
and collected a team-high 51 
points in 52 games last year.

Freshmen 
Jack 
Becker, 

Michael Pastujov — brother 
of sophomore forward Nick 
Pastujov — and Dakota Raabe, 
and graduate transfer Alex 
Roos — who spent the last four 
seasons at Colorado College 
— round out the new crop of 
forwards. 
Pearson 
expects 

Norris, along with the other 
newcomers, 
to 
spark 
the 

previously 
underwhelming 

offense.

Defensemen

Though 
Michigan 
lost 

captain and defensive mainstay 
Nolan 
De 
Jong, 
who 
now 

plays for the ECHL’s Colorado 
Eagles, the Wolverines boast 
eight veterans controlling the 
blue line.

Seniors 
Cutler 
Martin 

and 
Sam 
Piazza 
lead 
the 

defensemen. After a junior 
season 
at 
forward, 
Martin 

returns to his comfort zone. As 
a freshman, his only full year as 
a defenseman, he recorded 15 
points and a plus-12 rating, best 
among Michigan blueliners and 
second among all defensemen 
in the Big Ten. Conversely, 
Piazza is coming off a career 
year with 14 points — six 
goals and eight assists — in 32 
games and a Big Ten Honorable 
Mention distinction.

Freshman Quinn Hughes is 

the lone defensive recruit, but 
the learning curve shouldn’t 
be too difficult for the likely 
2018 first-round NHL Entry 
Draft pick. The Orlando native 
played two seasons with the 
United States National Team 
Development 
Program 
— 

alongside Norris — and notched 

47 points, including 38 assists, 
in 56 games. Hughes has already 
shown his presence on the ice, 
scoring his first collegiate goal 
in his first collegiate game 
against St. Lawrence.

Junior Joseph Cecconi has 

also looked strong coming out 
of the gates, tallying three 
assists in the exhibition game 
and one against St. Lawrence. 
Sophomores 
Griffin 
Luce, 

Christian 
Meike 
and 
Luke 

Martin, and junior Nicholas 
Boka complete the rest of the 
defense.

With Martin’s confidence in 

returning to his true position, 
Piazza’s evolution last year 
and Hughes’ track record, the 
back line seems destined to 
offset the hole left by De Jong 
and stay strong against Big Ten 
offensive juggernauts.

Outlook

With a strong freshman class 

and experienced veterans, it’s 
just a matter of time the two 
groups mesh within Pearson’s 
new schemes. This weekend’s 
series against Vermont is the 
last opportunity to sync before 
Big Ten play commences at 
Penn State. If the players catch 
their strides at the right time 
and execute in the big spots, 
especially early in the season, 
lofty expectations will be met, 
something last year’s team 
didn’t accomplish.

Big Ten Breakdown: Notre Dame 
shakes up conference landscape

Michigan opens up Big Ten 

play in State College against 
Penn State next weekend, while 
other teams have already had 
their conference debuts. The 
Big Ten is rife with storylines 
this season, as the Wolverines 
will look to redeem themselves 
after last season’s loss to the 
Nittany Lions in the first round 
of the Big Ten Tournament. 

Despite Penn State’s upset 

over No. 8 Minnesota in the 2017 
Big Ten Tournament semifinals 
last season, the Golden Gophers 
are looking keen to avenge that 
upset this year as coach Don 
Lucia boasts an eclectic mix of 
talented young phenoms and 
seasoned veterans.

Most notably for the Big Ten, 

Notre Dame joins conference 
play as the seventh affiliate. 
The Fighting Irish were a 
part of the WCHA and CCHA 
from 1971-1981 and 1992-2012, 

respectively, two conferences 
in which a collection of Big 
Ten programs also competed 
in. The Daily breaks down the 
2017 rendition of the Big Ten 
conference.

No. 6 Wisconsin

The Badgers (1-1 Big Ten, 

4-1 overall) are coming off a 
heartbreaking double-overtime 
loss to the Nittany Lions in the 
Big Ten Championship game 
last season.

However, Wisconsin clearly 

is not dwelling in the past, as its 
versatile offense is putting on 
a clinic, scoring first in all five 
of its games this year. Having 
their best start since 2004, 
the Badgers are challenging 
the 
preseason 
notion 
that 

Minnesota will be the dominant 
force in the conference.

Forward 
Seamus 
Malone 

notched his first two goals of 
the season this past weekend, 
but of the nine goals Wisconsin 

tallied in total, eight Badgers 
were 
responsible. 
Defender 

Wyatt Kalynuk also represents 
the shut-down defense as the 
best shot-blocker in the nation 
with 14 blocked shots.

No. 8 Minnesota

The 
touted 
frontrunners 

of the conference, the Golden 
Gophers (1-1, 2-2) already had a 
chance to seek revenge on Penn 
State this past weekend. But 
they split the contests, falling 
3-1 on Friday, and narrowly 
escaping the formidable Nittany 
Lion attack Saturday, 6-3.

Forward Brannon McManus 

stepped into the spotlight in 
Minnesota’s win Saturday with 
three goals in the third period, 
almost single-handedly saving 
the Golden Gophers from early 
humiliation.

At the onset of the season, 

Minnesota was ranked third in 
the nation according to USCHO

polls. With four members of 
the Golden Gopher squad on 
the Big Ten Preseason Watch 
List, 
Minnesota’s 
team 
is 

undoubtedly talented.

Forward Tyler Sheehy returns 

this season as a captain after a 
ground-shattering performance 
last season. Sheehy was named 
a First Team All-American and 
won the Big Ten Player of the 
Year award. With his experience, 
paired with McManus’ high-
energy start to the season, the 
Gophers have a well-rounded 
squad eager to make a statement 
on the national scale.

Ohio State

The 
Buckeyes 
(1-1, 
1-1-2) 

wasted no time in starting Big 
Ten play, facing off against 

Wisconsin and adding a win and 
a loss to their record.

Despite falling early in the 

NCAA Tournament last season 
– a tournament it had not made 
since 2009 – Ohio State returns 
15 upperclassmen, bolstering its 
proficient offense and effective 
power play.

Last season, the Buckeyes’ 

31.6 
percent 
power-play 

conversion rate ranked highest 
in the NCAA, and their 3.92 
goals per game ranked third.

All-American and First Team 

All-Big 
Ten 
forward 
Mason 

Jobst and forward Matthew 
Weiss headline the Ohio State 
offense.

No. 11 Penn State

The 
reigning 
Big 
Ten 

Tournament champion Nittany 
Lions (1-1, 2-2) entered the 
season ranked 10th, and were 
picked to finish fourth in the 

conference. Most notably, they 
were also tapped to finish fourth 
last season and ended up beating 
out the rest of the pool for a Big 
Ten Tournament title.

Goaltender Peyton Jones and 

forward Denis Smirnov, both 
named to the Big Ten Preseason 
Watch List, lead Penn State. 
Jones already flaunts 95 saves 
this season and Smirnov leads 
the team with three goals.

With most of the Nittany 

Lion squad returning from its 
tournament championship run 
last season, it is looking to bring 
a new hard-nosed mentality to 
the ice to redeem itself after 
an NCAA Tournament loss to 
eventual 
national 
champion 

Denver.

No. 5 Notre Dame

The Fighting Irish (2-1) are 

stepping onto the Big Ten stage, 
ready to upset the ebbs and 

flows that make up a regular Big 
Ten season. Already predicted to 
finish second in the conference, 
Notre Dame is looking to put its 
team depth to work to make a 
statement for the future.

With seven seniors returning, 

including Big Ten Preseason 
Watch List defenseman Jordan 
Gross, the Fighting Irish are 
taking a top-down approach that 
will involve all members of an 
assorted and dangerous squad.

Forwards Jake Evans and 

Andrew Oglevie join Gross on 
the same list, whose prowess 
was put on display in Notre 
Dame’s 
opening 
two 
wins 

over Alabama-Huntsville. The 
Fighting Irish debut in the Big 
Ten on Nov. 3rd.

Michigan State

Much like the triumphant 

return of Michigan coach Mel 
Pearson, the Spartans’ prodigal 

son 
in 
coach 
Danton 
Cole 

returns for his first season as the 
Michigan State head coach. Cole 
won a national championship 
with the Spartans in 1986 while 
a player on the team.

Under 
new 
management, 

Michigan State has a lot to 
prove but has a chip on its 
shoulder. Predicted to finish 
last in the Big Ten and sporting 
19 underclassmen – the fourth 
youngest roster in the nation 
– the Spartans will most likely 
have trouble with some of the 
other more experienced teams 
in the conference.

Last season, Michigan State 

averaged 
3.83 
goals 
against 

and 2.40 goals for, which pale 
in comparison to those same 
statistics for other members of 
the Big Ten. In order to compete 
at a level worthy of a high 
ranking in the Big Ten, Cole will 
have to instill new values and 
reorganize the team’s structure.

SAM MOUSIGIAN/Daily

Sophomore forward Will Lockwood finished the 2016 season as Michigan’s team MVP with 20 points, and he will be looked to again to drive Michigan’s offensive success in a conference loaded with talent.
