Mexican journalist freed by 
ICE accepts U-M fellowship

After a seven-month 
detention, Gutierrez 
Soto will join Knight-
Wallace Program

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

Emilio 
Gutiérrez 
Soto, 
a 
55-year-old Mexican journalist 
recently 
released 
from 
ICE 
detention, 
will 
be 
joining 
the 
University 
of 
Michigan 
community as a Knight-Wallace 
press freedom fellow for the 
2018-2019 school year. Through 
the Knight-Wallace Fellowship 
program, which sponsors up to 20 
mid-career journalists annually, 
Gutiérrez Soto will spend eight 
months in Ann Arbor studying 
security issues facing the press.
Gutiérrez Soto fled his home 
country in 2008 after discovering 
his name was on a hit list due to 
his reporting on corruption in 
the Mexican military. He and 

his now 25-year-old son, Oscar, 
crossed the U.S.-Mexico border 
near Columbus, New Mexico and 
requested political asylum.
According to the Committee to 
Protect Journalists, 45 reporters 
have been killed in Mexico since 
1992 and 37 of those murders went 
unpunished. In an email interview 
with The Daily, B.A. Snyder of the 
National Association of Hispanic 
Journalists said Gutiérrez Soto 
had legitimate cause to seek 
asylum in the United States.
“Mr. Gutiérrez-Soto and his son 
had a credible fear of persecution,” 
Snyder 
wrote. 
“There 
was 
abundant evidence that Mexican 
journalists who have reported 
on government corruption face 
persecution (including death), and 
that such crimes are committed 
with impunity. To deny Petitioners 
asylum would have been an 
egregious break with this Nation’s 
long-standing 
commitment 
to 
provide refuge to journalists from 
foreign lands who are the targets 
of reprisal.”

For the first seven months of 
asylum proceedings, Gutiérrez 
Soto and his son lived in a 
detention 
facility, 
but 
were 
eventually released with work 
permits. They moved to Las 
Cruces, New Mexico, where they 
spent nine years working in food 
business.
Represented 
by 
attorney 
Eduardo 
Beckett, 
Gutiérrez 
Soto continued to work towards 
political asylum, meeting regularly 
with Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement officials throughout 
the process.
In July 2017, Gutiérrez Soto’s 
asylum request was denied.
Beckett filed to reopen the 
asylum case. Meanwhile, various 
organizations dedicated to free 
press, including the National 
Society of Hispanic Journalists, 
the National Press Club and 
Reporters Without Borders, began 
to advocate for Gutiérrez Soto.

Whitmer and 
Schuette win

Party favorites beat 
out opponents in 
gubernatorial primaries

By GRACE KAY

Summer Managing News Editor

After 
winning 
the 
primary 
elections 
Tuesday 
night, 
gubernatorial candidates Gretchen 
Whitmer and Bill Schuette will 
face off in the general elections in 
November.
A former state senator, Whitmer 
beat out Indian-born entrepreneur, 
Shri 
Thanedar 
and 
ex-Detroit 
health 
director, 
Abdul 
El-Sayed 
in Tuesday’s Democratic primary, 
while Attorney General Bill Schuette 
beat out Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, state 
senator Patrick Colbeck and doctor 
Jim Hines for the GOP primary.
Both Whitmer and Schuette were 
considered the favorites in their 
respective parties. While Whitmer 
was 
backed 
by 
her 
extensive 
political experience and community 
envolvement, Schuette was supported 
by his current involvement in state 
government and openly endorsed by 
President Donald Trump.
The 
Associated 
Press 
called 
the race for Schuette at 9:24 p.m. 
Schuette was still in the lead as 
of 10:20 p.m. With 2,086 of 4,805 
precincts reporting, Schuette was 
winning by 51.0 percent of the vote 
with Calley trailing behind at 24.4 
and Colbeck at 13.9. 
Whitmer’s success was announced 
soon after. At 9:55 p.m. Whitmer 
officially claimed her spot as the 
Democratic candidate in the general 
election. As of 10:20 p.m. with 
2,136 of 4,805 precincts reporting, 
Whitmer had 49.6 percent of the 
votes. El-Sayed trailed just behind 
her with 34.1 percent and Thanedar 
with 16.2 percent.

Judge defends U-M 
Bias Response Team

Federal ruling 
says team does not 
threaten free speech

By GRACE KAY

Summer Managing News Editor

A federal judge has denied 
Speech First’s motion to end the 
University of Michigan’s use of 
the Bias Response Team after 
the nonprofit organization filed 
a lawsuit against the University 
claiming the team hindered free 
speech on campus.
Judge Linda V. Parker of the 
U.S. District Court sided with 
the University’s defense stating 
the Bias Response Team does not 
mete out discipline but rather 
works as a support system for 
victims of bias incidents.
“The evidence does not even 
reflect an instance where the 
BRT criticized the speech of an 
individual who is reported to 

have engaged in biased conduct,” 
Parker’s statement reads. “But 
even if the record reflected 
that the BRT had criticized 
an 
individual’s 
speech, 
there 
would be no First Amendment 
violation ‘in the absence of some 
actual or threatened imposition 
of 
governmental 
power 
or 
sanction.’”
University spokeswoman Kim 
Broekhuizen said the University 
is reviewing the ruling but is 
pleased by the result.
“We are carefully reviewing this 
ruling for all of its implications,” 
Broekhuizen wrote in an email 
interview. 
“We 
are 
pleased 
to see the court has affirmed 
our definitions of bullying and 
harassment and agrees that the 
mission of the university’s Bias 
Response Team is educational, 
not punitive and does not violate 
the First Amendment.”

Ann Arbor-based 
Duo Security to help 
IT giant create multi-
cloud solutions

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor

In a $2.35 billion cash deal 
announced Aug. 2, Ann Arbor-based 
internet 
security 
company 
Duo 
Security will be acquired by Cisco 
Systems, a multinational information 
technology 
and 
networking 
corporation based in San José.
The acquisition, Cisco’s second-
largest ever, is expected to close during 
the first quarter of the 2019 fiscal 
year. Duo will become part of Cisco’s 
networking and security unit, with 
Dug Song, Duo CEO and co-founder, 
staying on as the company’s general 
manager. There will be no employee 
relocations, and until the deal closes, 
the two companies will continue 
operating separately.
Duo provides cloud-based unified 
security access and multi-factor 
authentication to help secure users 
from cyberattacks. Founded in 2009, 
the company now has locations in 
Ann Arbor, San Mateo, Austin and 
London and reported over $100 
million in annual revenue for 2017. 
Song and co-founder Jon Oberheide 
were named 2017 Entrepreneurs of 
the Year by the Michigan Venture 
Capital Association. 
During its Series D funding round 
in Fall 2017, Duo set a state record 

for venture capital funding, raising 
$70 million from investors including 
Cisco.
Todd Graham, the director of 
security strategy for Cisco and 
a University of Michigan alum, 
said Cisco and Duo grew closer 
personally and professionally after 
the investment. He noted they had 
already been partners for several 
years due to their many similarities 
and shared customers.
“There are many, many customers 
that use our solutions together 
already,” Graham said. “They’ve been 
partnering with us on a certain level – 
on a more basic level – for years now, 
let’s call it three, four years. Really only 
the last year have we been, as part of 
the investment, working to figure 
out how we could work more closely 
together.”
Describing 
the 
acquisition 
of 
Duo as a natural extension of the 
relationship, Graham said the two 
companies offer very compatible 
products. According to Graham, 
Cisco’s Identity Services Engine helps 
protect users of a particular network, 
whereas Duo’s security platforms 
provide access control even when a 
user goes off-network.
“We have provided solutions for 
quite some time that allow you to bring 
the notion of someone’s identity, who 
they are, and create policy around 
them on the network,” Graham 
said. “What we obviously have 
discovered is the world has moved 
to a multi-cloud world.”

Claimant offers details on 

Rubadeau’s termination 

LEO helps lecturer 
file grievance 
against U-M

By GRACE KAY

Summer Managing News Editor

John Rubadeau, an award-win-
ning senior English lecturer at the 
University of Michigan, was flood-
ed with student support after his 
former typist Parker Procida sent 
a mass email to more than 4,000 
alumni informing them their for-
mer professor was terminated by 
the University without benefits. 
A Facebook support group titled 
“Friends of John” currently fea-
tures 339 members and a petition 
signed by 553 people. The group 
was created shortly after alum-
ni and undergraduate students 
received news of Rubadeau’s ter-
mination.
While alumni continue to voice 
support for Rubadeau, one for-
mer graduate student who asked 
to remain anonymous explains 
undergraduate 
students 
don’t 
understand the entire story behind 
Rubadeau’s termination.
“The reasons that seem to be 
circulating around the undergrads 
are not true,” he said.
The former graduate student 
expanded on this point by explain-
ing allegations that Rubadeau 
was fired due to “unprofessional 
behavior” are inaccurate.
“It doesn’t make sense to me 
that it has anything to do with 
pronouns, or dyed hair or beard,” 
he said. “From my perspective 
as someone who has been in that 
department and knows how peo-
ple feel about him and how people 
worried about him, it is far more 
than that. This story is about 
harassment, maybe of a sexual 
nature, maybe just of a repeatedly 
strange and inappropriate nature 
toward colleagues.”
The former graduate student 
had heard stories about Rubadeau 
from 
female 
colleagues 
even 
before he began working in Angell 
Hall.
“My female peers warned me 
about him and told me stories 
about him making them feel sexu-

ally vulnerable,” he said. “They 
didn’t want to be alone in a hall-
way with him.”
While 
his 
colleagues 
had 
warned him to avoid Rubadeau, 
the 
former 
graduate 
student 
emphasized it wasn’t until he 
began working on the same floor 
as the lecturer that he began to feel 
uncomfortable himself.
“Later on, when I began work-
ing in closer proximity to him, it 
became very clear he always want-
ed to be the center of attention,” 
the former graduate student said. 
“It was this weird behavior where 
if you didn’t pay attention to him, 
he would make you pay attention 
to him. I couldn’t shake him and 
it started to feel a little creepy. He 
would always be stopping me in 
the hall to talk to me and it got to 
the point where I felt I needed to 
wear headphones.”
The former graduate student 
sought outside advice regarding 
Rubadeau in the Fall 2017 term 
regarding the lecturer’s unusu-
al behavior. He explained he 
wouldn’t have reported Rubadeau 
to the Office for Institutional 
Equity and spoken to English 
Department Chair David Por-
ter if he hadn’t heard stories of 
Rubadeau making his female peers 
feel uncomfortable and openly 
objectifying women in the depart-
ment.
The former graduate student 
explained Rubadeau stopped one 
of the student’s close friends in the 
hall and told an inappropriate joke 
about a woman in his cohort.
“My friend felt ashamed and 
gross to have had that interaction,” 
he said. “I wouldn’t have gone on 
to talk to the department chair if 
I hadn’t known there were others. 
I felt I needed to add my voice to 
help others like my friend who felt 
less comfortable coming forward.”
The former graduate student 
explained Rubadeau’s behavior 
was atypical: He often stood too 
close to women and would report-
edly burst randomly into col-
league’s offices. He explained the 
incidences that were reported are 
hard to pinpoint as sexual harass-
ment or could even be dismissed as 
social awkwardness.

Taylor beats Councilmember Eaton in 
mayoral primaries, winning 59% of vote

By ALICE TRACEY

Summer Daily News Editor 

Christopher 
Taylor 
was 
chosen as the Democratic can-
didate for mayor of Ann Arbor 
in the Aug. 7 vote, beating his 
opponent, City Councilmem-
ber Jack Eaton, D-Ward 4, 
with a 59-percent majority.
Taylor, a Democrat, was 
elected mayor in 2014 and has 
since served two terms. Unlike 
Taylor’s first two terms, the 
upcoming term will last four 
years, according to a 2016 vote 
regarding term length.
Prior to serving as mayor, 
Taylor 
represented 
Ann 
Arbor’s 3rd Ward in City Coun-
cil from 2008 to 2014. He also 
practices with Hooper Hatha-
way, P.C., a law firm in Ann 
Arbor. A New York City native, 
Taylor has four degrees from 
the University of Michigan, in 
English, vocal performance, 
American history and law.
As Mayor, Taylor has cen-
tered 
his 
platform 
around 
infrastructure, 
sustainabil-
ity, social justice and afford-
ability. Recently, he has taken 
action on downtown develop-
ment, advancing the sale of 
Library Lot to developer Core 
Spaces. He also supported the 
formation of the Ann Arbor 
Police Task Force, a group 
working to outline how the 
city should monitor the Ann 
Arbor Police Department.
During the mayoral race, 
Eaton 
criticized 
Taylor’s 
approach to a number of issues. 
Eaton accused the mayor of 

falling short on improving 
public resources, addressing 
environmental concerns and 
making housing more afford-
able.
“The promises that the cur-
rent mayor is doing, what he 
will do for the next four years 
really reflects what he and his 
majority have not done for the 
last 10,” Eaton said.
Taylor, however, said he is 
committed to promoting pro-
gressive values in Ann Arbor.
“I 
support 
funding 
and 
building affordable housing, 
I support funding and imple-
menting our climate action 
plan, I support an active and 
strong policing commission,” 
Taylor said.
Taylor’s campaign won the 
endorsement of numerous Ann 
Arbor public servants and City 
Councilmembers. He has also 
received donations from the 
Michigan Laborers’ Political 
League PAC, LGBTQ activ-
ist Jim Toy and Laura Rubin, 
executive 
director 
of 
the 
Huron River Watershed Coun-
cil.
Amanda Uhle, CEO of the 
Hawkins 
Project, 
praised 
Taylor for his dedication to 
the city of Ann Arbor in an 
endorsement on Taylor’s cam-
paign website.
“Having known him for 
many years, I’m always aston-
ished by his unflagging energy 
and his thoughtful approach 
to everything he undertakes,” 
Uhle said. “Taylor has dem-
onstrated that he is precisely 
what Ann Arbor needs — a 

deeply empathetic leader who 
makes bold, considered deci-
sions to benefit us all.”
Commenting 
on 
his 
approach to leadership, Tay-
lor said he values being honest 
with his constituents. Tay-
lor hopes to see open lines of 
communication between Ann 
Arbor voters and elected offi-
cials such as himself.
“One of my principles serv-
ing as mayor is to tell people 
candidly what we can do and 
what we cannot do,” Taylor 
said. “I think it’s important 
that people know that they 
can rely upon their mayor not 
to tell them what they want 
to hear but to tell them the 
truth.”
Ann Arbor also held Demo-
cratic and Republican prima-
ry elections for City Council 
August 7.
Democrat Jeff Hayner won 
the Ward 1 primary and will 
face 
Democratic 
Socialist 
Ryan Hughes in November.
Kathy Griswold, a Demo-
crat, topped incumbent Kirk 
Westphal in Ward 2. Demo-
crat Julie Grand, who cur-
rently serves on Council, won 
in Ward 3.
Wards 4 and 5 both saw 
some changes, with Democrat 
Elizabeth 
Nelson 
defeating 
incumbent Graydon Krapohl 
(D-Ward 4) and Ali Ramlawi 
beating 
incumbent 
Chuck 
Warpehoski (D-Ward 5).

C

ity life nurtures and 
fosters phone addic-
tion. Calling a cab, pin-
pointing yourself on a map, 
and deciding where to grab 
a quick lunch each contrib-
ute to the need to keep your 
smartphone in your hand. 
Living in a big city for three 
months this summer allowed 
me to face this dilemma 
head-on; I attempted to navi-
gate my way through Man-
hattan while keeping my 
eyes on the world around me, 
but it became all too easy to 
quickly respond to one more 
text or email while using my 
phone for seemingly neces-
sary tasks. When using my 
phone to look up the next 
train time, for example, I’d 
feel compelled to read a mes-
sage I’d received. I’d only feel 
this burden, of course, if I 
saw the notification. I felt the 
answer to this was to turn off 
the iMessage notifications on 
my phone. That way, while 
reading an e-book on the 
subway or trying to figure 
out whether I was walking 
east or west, I wouldn’t be 
bombarded by distractions. 
While listening to music, 
reading some news or man-
aging my calendar that I’ve 
programmed my phone to 
control, I wouldn’t acciden-
tally be available to chat.
It worked. I slowly but 
surely began to forget to 
check my phone and started 
to intentionally use it with 
the 
purpose 
of 
contact-
ing somebody: to make a 
phone call, send an email or 
make plans, but never just 
to chat, never to make small 
talk, which would have kept 
my eyes superglued to my 
phone and would’ve robbed 
me of the bustling and col-
orful New York City sur-
roundings. Phantom phone 
vibrations, anxiety-induced 
phone checks and habitually 
full hands faded as I honed 
my ability to resist distrac-
tions. This allowed me to eat 
while walking — a novelty. I 
became able to get lost in the 
work I was meant to be doing 
without hearing a buzz to 
nag me to stop. I became 
aware of the peculiar way 
we’ve adopted into our soci-
ety “the phone vibration,” 
which was initially meant 
to increase the ease with 
which we communicate, but 
instead, has increased the 
difficulty with which we do 
anything else.

I have since moved out of 
New York and planted myself 
in Maine for the rest of the 
summer. Out of the chaos 
and into the serenity, both 
forested and rustic, condu-
cive to physical activity and 
lounging. Someone in a cof-
fee shop on West 26th Street 
once told me that “the sun 
is warmer in Maine.” I’d 
have to agree. Here, I work 
as a counselor at an all-girls 
summer camp that proudly 
and strictly bans cell phone 
use. It’s been this way for 97 
summers, and no one plans 
on changing it anytime soon. 
Living simply and without 
electricity allows campers 
and staff alike to step from a 
hectic world into a space that 
challenges us to learn, con-
nect and make friends with-
out hitting “send.” 
I’ll gladly be the first to say 
— no, the first to shout — that 
being here makes me feel 
healthier. I haven’t charged 
my phone in four days and I 
feel like I’ve been released 
from its maw. In my down-
time, I read or start a conver-
sation with somebody who 
also put their phone away 
for the summer; there isn’t 
even an outlet in my cabin to 
charge my device if I wanted 
to. I feel present, attentive 
and more capable of making 
my own decisions without 
the input of others.
Call me crazy, call me 
archaic, but I’m not the only 
one who feels this way. This 
week, in an effort to bolster 
educational practices, France 
decided 
that 
smartphones 
will be banned in schools 
for students aged three to 
15, with Greece implement-
ing similar policies; the Lon-
don School of Economics 
and Political Science found 
that this ban discernibly 
raises test scores. Scientists 
have been researching other 
aspects of this overwhelm-
ingly invasive technology-
dependent culture, especially 
among 
students. 
Sleep, 
a 
prequel and sequel to hard 
work, is diminished by phone 
use; a Spanish study dis-
cusses the potential of cell 
phone abuse interfering with 
healthy 
sleeping 
patterns, 
resulting in detrimental con-
sequences such as anxiety, 
as well as causing personal 
stress, which leads to a state 
of alertness that results in

A 

summer in China with 
your best friend sounds 
like an absolute dream, 
right? It is, of course, just as long as 
you know the basic guidelines of 
navigating a Buddhist temple. As 
the typical obnoxious Americans 
we are, we made a couple mistakes; 
from talking loudly to taking clan-
destine pictures of Buddha.
My best friend Jocelyn and I 
had decided to travel to Beijing for 
a couple days before the official 
start of our Clean Energy program 
in Xiamen, China. Since we were 
shameless tourists, we absolutely 
had to visit the Forbidden City, the 
Great Wall of China and the Sum-
mer Palace. Honestly, the main 
reason why we chose to go to the 
Summer Palace is because it had 
the most attractive pictures when 
we were searching up historical 
attractions in Beijing. And wow, 
Google did not disappoint — the 
Summer Palace was absolutely 
breathtaking . In hindsight how-
ever, what we really should have 
googled was “proper temple-visit-
ing etiquette.”
The Summer Palace itself could 
be best described as a miniature 
kingdom. When you first walk in 
through the main gates, you quickly 
stumble upon an area that seems 
to be lost in time. The palace was 
crowded with a lot of visitors, as 
well as several services meant for 
the hundreds of daily tourists, but 
even with all the hustle and bustle, 
the palace maintained a sense of 

reverence and beauty that I had 
never experienced before.
After climbing up a regrettable 
number of stairs, we finally arrived 
at the first major temple. At first, I 
couldn’t believe my eyes of the size, 
the brilliant gold and the almost 
godlike quality that the Buddha 
statue effortlessly possessed. The 
statue itself was located in the center 
of the temple, almost as if to say that 
he was too the center of the uni-
verse. Ignorantly, my first reaction 
was to take a photo so that I could 
remember the majesty of the grand 
Buddha that commanded in front of 
me. But before my finger could even 
press down on the camera button, I 
felt a sharp nudge on my side. It was 
Jocelyn, wide-eyed and surprisingly 
silent she pointed at a nearby sign 
that had a huge cross in front of a 
picture of a camera. Whoops.
I didn’t know that you aren’t 
allowed to take pictures of the great 
Buddha, and couldn’t believe that I 
had almost committed blasphemy in 
such a sacred and revered temple. 
We wandered along the lakeside 
for a while before deciding to take a 
dragon-shaped boat to a small island 
that resembled a small mountain in 
the middle of the lake. From within 
the boat, we could see that there 
were easily hundreds of people all 
around the lake who had come to 
pay their visit to Buddha as well 
as the great architectural skills of 
ancient China. It was a truly awe-
some sight to behold, knowing that 
we were celebrating the beauty of 

the same culture alongside each 
other.
Almost hidden on top of that 
miniature mountain, we stumbled 
upon a temple that was strikingly 
distinct from any of the others that 
we had seen so far. The entirety 
of the temple’s walls, both inside 
and out, were covered with tiny yet 
intricate Buddha statues that must 
have been no taller than six inches 
each. Glancing at a nearby sign that 
thankfully had some English writ-
ten on it, we read that the temple 
had more than 700 of these tiny 
Buddhas as decoration.
Regardless of the location, how-
ever, we got distracted and began 
joking loudly with each other. It 
wasn’t until a random lady began 
yelling at us in Chinese that we real-
ized we were being incredibly rude, 
and that we should have acted in a 
more respectful manner to both the 
people and Buddha himself. Cheeks 
burning red from pure embarrass-
ment, Jocelyn and I apologized 
profusely in English and once again 
had to leave the temple area in com-
plete and utter shame.
After that whole ordeal, both Joc-
elyn and I can tell you that the moral 
of this story is pretty clear. When 
traveling to a country with a differ-
ent culture than your own, please 
make sure to research the culture. 
That means religion, too — unless 
you want to face the consequences 
of looking as foolish as I did that day 
in the Summer Palace.

H

ero. That’s a big word, 
a title not easy to 
come by. Let’s think 
about the classics: Superman, 
Captain America, Spiderman, 
Batman — the list goes on. 
However, at the ESPYS this 
year, we saw a new wave of 
heroes claim their titles. Larry 
Nassar, the former team doctor 
for 
USA 
Gymnastics 
and 
Michigan State University, has 
recently been sentenced to up 
to 175 years in prison thanks 
to the brave testimonies of 
hundreds 
of 
the 
survivors 
of his sexual abuse. Their 
speaking up was incredibly 
important 
in 
breaking 
the 
culture of silence that normally 
surrounds 
women’s 
sports. 
Aly Raisman — a two-time 
Olympian and three-time gold 
medalist at the forefront of the 
movement against Nassar — is 
one of those many heroes. Her 
testimony has been powerful 
and moving and many have 
felt encouraged by her words, 
as many would never suspect 
that such a strong, talented, 
powerful woman could have 
gone through such a traumatic 
experience. The truth is, her 
story is all too common.
At the ESPYS, 141 of Nassar’s 
victims took the stage to claim 
the 
Arthur 
Ashe 
Courage 
Award. 
These 
survivors 
spoke with so much wisdom 
when 
they 
accepted 
their 
award and it was an honor to 
witness. Sarah Klein, Nassar’s 
first victim, said, “Make no 
mistake, we are here on this 
stage to present an image for 
the world to see, a portrait 
of survival. A new vision of 
courage.” She continued on to 
talk about how important it is 
to speak out against abusers, 
no matter how difficult that 
may be. The most shocking 
part of the acceptance was 
when Raisman listed all of the 
years that there were claims of 
sexual abuse against Nassar. 
“1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2004, 
2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016.” 
For 10 years, those Nassar 
abused were ignored. How 
can these adults ignore young 
women and girls telling them 
about their abuse? Here we 
have an example of when the 
survivors weren’t silent, but 
the system failed them over 
and over and over again. The 

people in positions of power 
decided that the words of 

these women were not strong 
enough 
to 
stand 
against 
Larry Nassar. They let him 
continue his abuse. This lack 
of accountability from those 
in charge is what continues 
to drive this cone of silence 
surrounding women’s sports. 
It stops victims from coming 
forward 
and 
allows 
these 
coaches, trainers, managers, 
etc. to continue to abuse.
The Nassar scandal doesn’t 
stand alone. Recently, there 
have been allegations against 
a former doctor for Ohio State 
University. Those who came 
forward revealed how badly 
the situation was handled. 
Based 
on 
Ron 
McDaniel’s 
story, it was clear that coaches 
and administrators knew of 
his abuse and continuously 
failed 
to 
act. 
McDaniel 
spoke about how when his 
teammates heard about what 
had happened to him they 
just 
laughed 
and 
basically 
said, “Yeah, that happens all 
the time to everyone. It’s no 
secret.” At the University of 
South Carolina there have been 
allegations of abuse against 
the campus gynecologist. The 
abuse is said to have spanned 
over 30 years and, as of now, 
200 women have come forward 
with their stories. He did this 

from the time he began his job 
at the university until the time 
he 
stopped 
working 
there. 
This shows there is a pattern 
of abuse that goes ignored and 
is hushed up by universities all 
around the country. Women 
and men have come forward, 
sharing 
their 
stories 
and 
telling us they were brushed 
off and not taken seriously by 
university officials. Though 
women in particular face more 
of this kind of abuse than 
men, especially in the sports 
community, it is so important 
to remember that there are 
many people out there who 
have gone through what you 
have. Women and men alike, 
despite all the differences, go 
through similar issues, have 
survived the same abuse and 
stand strong through it all. If 
there is going to be any kind of 
progress, it needs to start with 
administrators and the people 
receiving these reports. Each 
one should be taken seriously 
and thoroughly investigated. 
Dismissing 
these 
kinds 
of 
allegations should no longer 
be, and never should have 
been, an option. 
Raisman’s 
words 
so 
accurately depicted how the 
system failed all 141 women 
standing on that stage: “All 
those years we were told, ‘You 
are wrong. You misunderstood. 
He’s a doctor. It’s okay. Don’t 
worry, we’ve got it covered. 
Be careful. There are risks 
involved.’ The intention: to 
silence us in favor of money, 
medals and reputation.” But 
she then reminded everyone 
that nobody is alone when she 
said, “We may suffer alone, 
but 
we 
survive 
together.” 
These women are true heroes. 
These women are the new 
image of courage. They stood 
up to their abuser despite 
countless setbacks, showing 
unparalleled 
courage. 
Let’s 
use 
these 
women 
as 
an 
example of what it means to 
be brave and use their stories 
to address the multitude of 
issues — like victim-blaming 
and payoffs — that exist within 
the system. Let us no longer be 
silent. Let us be brave. Let us 
be courageous. Let us follow in 
the footsteps of these heroes.

sleep and lower sleep quality. 
Another 
study 
found 
that 
students who refrained from 
using 
their 
phones 
during 
class wrote down 62 percent 
more information from lecture 
and scored a full one and a 
half letter grades higher on a 
multiple-choice test.
Aside from the question of 
how phones impact the lives 
of students, what are mobile 
devices doing to us socially? 
Upton Saiidi reported that “87 
percent of millennials admitted 
to missing out on a conversation 
because they were distracted 
by their phone,” corroborating 
Melissa Dahl’s claims that the 
presence of cell phones make us 
less empathetic; simply placing 
a mobile device on the table 
during a meal reduces feelings 
of “interconnectedness.” Cara 
McCoogan and James Titcomb 
provide us with the evidence 
showing that the presence 
of smartphones make us less 
smart, 
while 
Mike 
Elgan 
writes about how they make us 
distracted and unproductive. 
“As a thought experiment,” 
he writes, “imagine that an 
employee who used to pay 
attention 
to 
your 
business 
eight hours each day now pays 
attention only seven hours a 
day because he or she is now 
focusing on Facebook during 
that last hour.” He then goes on 
to cite Flurry Analytics, whose 
data put U.S. smartphone user-
time to be more than five hours 
per day, and found that the 
time spent using mobile apps 
increased 69 percent from 2015 
to 2016. The story to which 
I relate most is one written 
by Michael Gonchar for the 
New York Times; it raises the 
point that though technology 
is supposed to make us feel 
more connected to one another, 
though it is supposed to help 
us stay in touch all the time, 

a lot of us actually feel that 
it’s “getting in the way of real 
socializing” and “making us 
more alone.”
I know we can’t all go to 
Maine for the summer, and we 
can’t all go four days without 
a phone because of safety 
and 
responsibility; 
group 
texts are quite necessary for 
collaboration on projects and 
a perfectly timed email tells 
you that class is cancelled. But 
summer is the perfect time to 
take baby steps, to opt for that 
one day at a time without your 
phone. An even smaller step, a 
movement in which Generation 
Z is apparently participating, 
is electing to get off social 
media by deleting your apps 
or accounts, thus removing 
any 
temptation 
to 
refresh 
your news feed. We grew up 
“digitally connected,” looking 
at photos of lives where the 
grass is always greener, or it’s 
edited and filtered to look that 
way.
Summer is the perfect time 
to turn off text notifications 
and only use your phone for 
its map and camera, to try it 
out and monitor whether you 
feel less anxious or sleep more 
soundly. It is the perfect time to 
rehabilitate your relationship 
with your phone, to reshape 
your brain to focus on what’s 
in front of you, a skill for which 
you’ll be grateful when it’s time 
to get back into schoolwork. 
It is the perfect time to go on 
a hike and not document it on 
Snapchat or Instagram, to like 
your day instead of a picture of 
somebody else’s.
Summer is the perfect time 
to recharge your mind instead 
of your phone. So give it a shot. 
I dare you.

Given the constant turbulence in 
Detroit, I’ve always considered Chi-
cago as the closest city to Ann Arbor, 
and the capital of the Midwest. 
Rather than venture east down I-94, 
my family always opted to go west a 
few extra hundred miles.
I familiarized myself with the 
Loop over Woodward Avenue and 
Chicago-style hot dogs over Coney 
Island depots in secret parts of 
D-Town. I could even trace a map 
of Grant Park on my palm to help 
locals navigate the 319 acres of 
urban greenery.
But add in multiple stages, food 
vendors, medical tents and an influx 
of very dehydrated people and Grant 
Park transforms from the familiar 
to barely ordered chaos.
At Lollapalooza, you can stop in 
the middle of a road with working 
traffic lights and take in old-school 
rock through one ear colliding with 
EDM from the opposite side. The 
diverse, but strictly structured line-
up makes for a hit-or-miss schedule 
spread over four exhausting and 
memorable days.
DAY ONE
Nick Mulvey opened Lollapaloo-
za at Tito’s stage to a low-energy 
crowd, many of whom were stalling 
for a nearby act: A position in the 
schedule no musician would envy. 
The English singer-songwriter’s 
elaborate rhythm guitar patterns 
and lyrics did not make the task any 
easier.
However, 
Mulvey’s 
English 
roots were not the source of his 

set’s appeal. The abundance of 
British-influenced rock makes a 
soloist unlikely to provide original-
ity. Instead, Mulvey pulled from his 
musical education in Havana, Cuba, 
for rich vocal runs that engaged the 
listless, intimate gathering in a call-
and-response.
In comparison to Mulvey’s listen-
ing-room style atmosphere, Cuco, 
at the neighboring Bud Light stage, 
was a lesson on psychedelics and 
swagger.
The young hip-hop artist added 
an interactive screen to an electric 
instrument ensemble that shim-
mied with each bump of the drum-
set. A plume of cannabis smoke 
saluted him when he, needlessly, 
asked, “Where my smokers at?” As 
Cuco fluctuated between dazed 
swaying and crazed jumping, the 
crowd matched his every move.
Afternoon 
festival-goers 
not 
inclined to hip hop or EDM hop-
scotched across a dusty field for 
the slew of alternative bands at 
the adjacent Lake Shore and Grant 
Park stages. People worried about 
permanent damage to their hear-
ing lounged on a hill like football 
fans impartial to the final score, just 
hoping to watch both endzones for a 
spectacular catch.
Although admirable each in 
their own right, a general lack of 
stage presence made the badass 
and expressive sign language inter-
preters a better show than the fea-
tured performers. The cameramen 
agreed, often focusing on an inter-
preter with a ginger Khal Drogo-
esque ponytail fohawk who did a 
more impressive air guitar than the 

actual musicians.
Seasoned vets Stars, who last 
played the festival a decade ago, 
strained to keep non-superfans 
interested. 
The 
vocal 
pairing 
between the reserved Amy Millan 
(of Broken Social Scene) and aged 
maniac Torquil Campbell clashed 
poorly live.
While Millan’s angelic voice 
created a contemplative mood, 
Campbell 
went 
haywire 
with 
incomprehensible shouting too far 
away from his microphone to pick 
up a signal. Since Campbell largely 
contributed melodica and tam-
bourine, while sharing vocals with 
his bandmates who had legitimate 
instruments, his antics were likely a 
sign of overcompensation.
The Wombats and Franz Ferdi-
nand followed, drawing crowds of 
supporters, but fading into the cli-
ches of their respective genres with 
little impact.
The next two bands to share the 
expansive field were the standouts 
of the whole first day. I would nomi-
nate them as headliners if the first, 
LANY, had a longer discography 
and the second, CHVRCHES, had 
more intentional set design and cho-
reography.
Paul Klein, frontman of LANY, 
burst onto the stage with a freshly 
shaven head and an unintentional 
mission to bring back sagging pants. 
At various points, Klein flashed the 
audience his boxer-briefs, coupling 
this carefree nature with an extro-
verted intensity that added depth to 
the bubbly and relatable set.
Even with a number of techni-
cal setbacks, LANY kept the energy 

level high. While the audio-tech-
nicians tried to solve the mystery 
problem, Klein launched into an 
impromptu solo performance of 
“Made in Hollywood” that proved 
his charisma alone could carry a 
concert.
CHVRCHES had the task of play-
ing against platinum-selling artist 
Khalid. They delivered a set that left 
no regrets for those who passed over 
the young R&B singer. Despite lead 
vocalist Lauren Mayberry sport-
ing the stature and speaking voice 
of a twelve-year old girl, her vocal 
strength made the open space take 
on the dimensions of an enclosed 
stadium.
After these two knockout perfor-
mances, the headliners for Thurs-
day night were a disappointment 
from the inaccessible Arctic Mon-
keys to the unnecessary Galantis 
— I’m sorry, but what’s the point of 
watching a DJ “live” — and the may-
hem of Travis Scott, which included 
a naked man, an awkward proposal 
and an even more cringe-worthy 
attempt from a fan to snag a photo 
with Scott.
Although there will never be 
a consensus on “objectively good 
music,” fun sets with a broader 
appeal make a reliable headliner 
fallback option, which Thursday 
lacked. LANY’s catchy lyrics, where 
one listen turns the chorus into a 
sing-along, could have filled that 
role.
Similarly, the upbeat electro-pop 
of CHVRCHES welcomes newcom-
ers rather than only entertaining 
longtime fans. Plus moving May-
berry’s band into the last time slot 
would add a more than worthy 
female-driven act to the all-male 
headliner schedule.
DAY TWO
Matt Maeson kicked off Friday 
with a hard-to-beat standard for 
the otherwise weak early afternoon 
schedule, which included a pitchy 
cover of Avril Lavigne from Alex 
Lahey.
Maeson showed his nerves dur-
ing soundcheck, running through 
his songs up to the last minute and 
incessantly chain smoking. How-
ever, every musician knows a little 
anxiety gives urgency and authen-
ticity to the performance. Dressed 
in all white, Maeson provided 
soulful, raw vocals with his father 
slaughtering the occasional guitar 
solo. 
Among the series of smaller 
artists, the BMI stage, known for 
introducing artists like Chance the 
Rapper and Lady Gaga, presented 
pop-punk band Mainland. Located 
beneath a tunnel of trees, the area 
lured people to the shade for some 

new music.
In an interview with The Daily, 
Mainland lead vocalist Jordan Topf 
described the origins of the band’s 
name, “The first time I heard the 
word ‘mainland,’ my mom told me 
a secret she kept from me my whole 
life about a time when she was 18 
and fell in love with this profes-
sional surfer and moved to Hawaii 
with him to have a secret marriage. 
She ended the marriage because she 
missed the mainland of California. 
It’s this hidden piece of her story 
that resonated with me when we 
were trying to find a name. We’re all 
from California and that became the 
genesis of our name.”
Although based in New York City, 
the California-roots of the band 
members shine through their East 
Coast veneer as they explore dark-
er subject matter through bright 
hooks.
Anticipation for Post Malone 
overshadowed James Bay whose 
evening set unfortunately turned 
into an opening act for the rapper. 
Eager Post fans occupied the front 
area and many did not hide their 
disinterest in Bay’s highly contrast-
ing musical style.
Regardless, Bay put on a master-
class on guitar and vocals. Unlike 
other attractive rockstars, Bay left 
no question that his talents lie in his 
music and not just his looks.
Traditionally, sets end on the 
musician’s biggest hit. After a late 
rendition of “Let It Go,” the crowd 
braced for the possibility of “Hold 
Back the River,” Bay’s other chart-
topper. Sensing the anticipation, 
Bay led the audience in an extended 
karaoke of the song’s bridge, “lonely 
water,” before letting the dam break.
A few years ago, during the wave 
of popular alternative music that 
benefited The 1975 and Mumford 
& Sons, The Neighborhood play-
ing the relatively small Tito’s venue 
would have been a surprise. How-
ever, since their breakout single 
“Sweater Weather,” the band has 
struggled to create songs distinct 
from one another with each verse 
reminiscent of the last and not in 
a way necessary to make an album 
cohesive. Played one after the other 
live, the similarities become more 
apparent and turn memorable tunes 
into uninteresting repetitions.
Even with the promise of Bruno 
Mars and The National to close the 
night, the craze around Post Malone 
made the popular rapper feel like 
another headliner. An hour before 
his start time, the crowd began 
chanting his name.

In any other year, “Christopher 
Robin” might’ve swooped into 
theaters and stolen our hearts 
with its whimsy and all around 
pleasant spirit. After all, who 
doesn’t love Winnie the Pooh? No 
one, that’s who.
In increasingly divided times, 
the enduring awesomeness of 
the silly old bear might be the 
one thing we can still agree on. 
Unfortunately, in 2018, Pooh has 
to contend with the feature film 
vehicles of another eminently 
likeable bear, Paddington, whose 
latest release stands as one of the 
best of the year.
Clearly, Pooh Bear was going 
to have to up his game for 
“Christopher Robin,” his first 
foray into live-action. He’d have 
to be more wholesome, more 
aloof 
and 
more 
dangerously 
addicted to honey. He’d have to 
practice his adorable pratfalls 
into the long hours of the night. 
Even Heffalumps and Woozles 
would find themselves captivated 
by his endless good nature.
It was either that, or coast on 
doing what the character had 
always 
done 
without 
adding 
anything new in the way of story 
or 
style, 
completely 
banking 
on the public’s love of the 
inhabitants of Hundred Acre 
Woods.
You can take your guess which 
option the creative team chose.
“Christopher 
Robin” 
is 
a 
perfectly fine movie. It’s funny 
and cute in all the ways you’d 
expect: Pooh remains an absolute 

delight of a character and, if you 
grew up on Disney’s “Winnie the 
Pooh” movies, seeing characters 
like Piglet, Rabbit and Eeyore 
again feels like reuniting with 
old friends (for the short time 
they’re on screen, at least).
Unfortunately, the story all 
too often leaves those old friends 
behind to focus on scenes of the 
title character’s generic family 
drama and work struggles. Like 
last year’s “Goodbye Christopher 
Robin,” it settles for being just 
likeable when it could and should 
have been so much more.
Robin 
(Ewan 
McGregor, 
“Beauty and the Beast”) leaves 
behind the Hundred Acre Woods 
and decades later spends so much 
time working that he doesn’t 
have any leftover time for his 

wife, Evelyn (Hayley Atwell, 
“Marvel’s Agent Carter”), and 
young daughter. It’s only after his 
family leaves for a vacation in the 
countryside without him that he 
is reunited with Pooh Bear, who 
needs his help to find his missing 
friends and maybe, just maybe, 
teach Robin a lesson about what’s 
really important in life.
Given the title of the movie, the 
increased focus on Christopher 
Robin was unavoidable, but was 
Christopher Robin ever anyone’s 

favorite part of the Winnie-the-
Pooh movies? Is Christopher 
Robin the reason anyone will be 
seeing this movie?
In the animated Disney films, 
he was usually the audience 
proxy, the character put in the 
story so the kids watching at 
home could pretend that they 
were playing and learning lessons 
in the Hundred Acre Woods.
The script banks on childhood 
nostalgia in the same way as “Toy 
Story 3,” presuming many of 
those who grew up with Winnie-
the-Pooh have gone on to have 
lives and children of their own, 
so when they see Robin’s struggle 
in the trailers, they’ll relate and 
take their kids to see it.
“Toy Story 3” didn’t focus on 
Andy, though. The story wasn’t 
as much about him moving on 
from his old toys as it was his 
old toys moving on from him. 
The same lesson was imparted 
and we all still cried, but the 
focus remained on the parts we’d 
always loved.
“Christopher Robin” is like 
if “Toy Story 3” just followed 
Andy around as he prepared for 
college.
Having 
director 
Marc 
Forster (“World War Z”)behind 
the camera doesn’t help. The 
director’s resume speaks for 
itself, but he all too often trends 
toward muted colors and shallow 
focus close-ups that don’t mesh 
well visually with Pooh’s bright 
world, rendering it downright 
dull at times. Even childhood 
scenes 
meant 
to 
be 
happy 
dampen the charm of the film. 
The Hundred Acre Woods have 
never looked so bland.

You reach above your head and 
pull the lap bar down tightly over 
your thighs, which have morphed 
into the concave shape of the hard 
seat that took some getting used to. 
Per usual, a park employee comes 
around to test your work by jostling 
the lap bar. Tight enough, she 
decides. You do your best to shove 
your neck out past the “padded” 
beams on either side of your head 
to see if your friend to your right is 
as excited as you are. He’s shoving 
his neck out too. Suddenly, but 
not surprisingly, the floor your 
feet were softly planted on drops 
and 
your 
legs 
dangle. Some guy 
on the platform 
presses a button, 
a weird hissing 
noise pierces your 
ears and you jolt 
forward. The roller coaster has 
begun; you’re now at the mercy of 
the powerful machine.
If 
you’ve 
ridden 
a 
roller 
coaster 
before, 
Travis 
Scott’s 
ASTROWORLD — an album title 
derived from a shuttered Houston 
amusement park of the same name 
— should be easy to understand. If 
you’re a scaredycatlame-o who’s 
never been on a roller coaster, well, 
that’s your loss, but ASTROWORLD 
is a near-perfect encapsualtion of 
that experience. What makes for 
a thrilling amusement park ride? 
Thrashing twists and turns, high 
highs that drop to low lows that 
shoot to higher highs, a surprising 
loop, 
behind-the-curtains 
mechanical perfection that makes 
for a comfortable and safe ride 
and a smooth ending that allows 
you to catch your breath and crave 
another round of the excitement 
you just experienced.
Scott’s 
third 
major 
label 

release boasts all of the above. 
The album’s first three tracks 
(“STARGAZING,” “CAROUSEL” 
and “SICKO MODE”) singe you 
with modern trap heat packed 
with perfectly placed beat switch-
ups that spin your head around 
without breaking your shoved-out 
neck. However, the pace changes 
suddenly but smoothly with “R.I.P. 
SCREW” and “STOP TRYING TO 
BE GOD,” two contemporary hip 
hop ballads soaked in beautiful 
bass. Then, just as a roller coaster 
shoots you from a low to a high 
in the blink of an eye, Scott dials 
the hype back up to a fever bitch 
with “NO BYSTANDERS,” a track 
featuring Scott’s most skilled 
rapping to date and a hook that 
will 
have 
you 
shouting “fuck the 
club up, bitch!” — 
something you’ve 
always wanted to 
say but never had 
the chance to.
Travis 
takes 
advantage 
of the trend of hiding artist 
features on a track list to make 
for chills-inducing moments of 
collaboration. Frank Ocean slides 
in to deliver a sultry hook on 
“CAROUSEL,” Drake drops catchy 
bars on “SICKO MODE,” Stevie 
Wonder and James Blake grace 
“STOP TRYING TO BE GOD” 
with harmonica and haunting 
vocals respectively, Tame Impala 
sprinkles 
psychedelia 
over 
“SKELETONS,” 
The 
Weeknd 
adds 
soprano 
sweetness 
to 
“WAKE UP,” John Mayer and 
Thundercat 
funkify 
the 
hazy 
“ASTROTHUNDER,” 21 Savage 
does 21 Savage on “NC-17” and 
Quavo and Takeoff enhance the 
southern-trap sound of “WHO? 
WHAT!” 

‘Astroworld’ hits

TMD reflects on popular 

joint, Quickie Burger 

Beer and burger 
restaurant closed 
for business

By ROB DALKA

Daily Staff Reporter

Earlier this summer, while most 
of the student population was 
away, Quickie Burger quietly shut 
its doors and boarded its windows. 
The manager, who made very lit-
tle information about the closing 
available, did not reply to efforts for 
comment, so patrons of the burger 
joint can’t do much more than 
reflect upon their memories.
Quickie Burger opened in 2008 
at State and Hill streets. Situated 
near plenty of student housing, it 
quickly became a popular burger 
joint among University of Michigan 
students. Some of Quickie Burger’s 
busiest days were Saturday home 
football games when thousands 
of passing tailgaters would stop to 
grab food.
Quickie Burger was not the most 
critically acclaimed burger place in 
Ann Arbor, but it was still able to 
attract lines out the door. In a 2009 
MLive food review, Alan Warren 
wrote Quickie Burger had inherent 
appeal despite tough competition.
“Don’t get us wrong,” War-
ren wrote. “If we were a college 
student looking for a reasonably 
cheap, post-bar feed chased with a 
Pabst Blue Ribbon, or, say, a Jaeger 
Bomb, we’d likely be in line with 
the rest of the students at 2 a.m.”
Alongside other late-night hot 
spots, Quickie Burger held its own. 
Students flocked to the restaurant 
for pitchers of beer and stacked 
burgers, both before and after 
going out. Quickie Burger was a 
lively place that many students 
remember fondly.
Information 
rising 
senior 
Miguel Martinez found Quickie 
Burger before his first year at the 
University and was impressed with 
what the burger joint had to offer.
“A friend introduced me to 
Quickie one day during freshman 
orientation,” Martinez said. 

“They asked me if I wanted their 
secret sauce with my burger and I 
was conflicted but my friend urged 
me to try it, along with their sig-
nature fries. Needless to say, I was 
floored.”
Others, like Engineering ris-
ing senior Jonatan Hervoso, who 
shared his thoughts in an email 
interview with The Daily, found 
Quickie Burger to be a place of con-
venience and tradition.
“I heard about quickie burger 
(sic) for the first time during my 
freshman year and a few friends 
and I started going pretty fre-
quently after rugby practice,” Her-
voso wrote.
Quickie Burger had a signature 
vibe. There was no divider between 
the cash register and the kitchen, 
revealing the cooks flipping burg-
ers and working the fryers. Beer 
taps lined the wall alongside a row 
of liquor. Stools sat across from the 
register counter, facing the window 
along State Street. One might not 
see it at first, but around the corner 
there were stairs that led down to 
a basement with table seating and 
televisions in each corner of the 
room. According to Quickie Burger 
patrons, the restaurant was small 
but friendly. It was often boisterous 
but still a great place to eat a burger 
and have some fun with friends, 
Quickie Burger fans told The Daily. 
Quickie Burger was not fine dining, 
but never set out to be.
“There wasn’t much that I dis-
liked other than maybe the clean-
liness of the bathrooms,” Hervoso 
wrote. “However I always appreci-
ated quickness of service and qual-
ity of food, again cheap but good.”
Now the building sits empty and 
quiet, with cardboard taped to the 
inside of the windows. No more 
burgers will be flipped or pitchers 
of beers consumed in the crowded 
basement. For many, it is a sad 
sight, and there is no doubt many 
students will be caught off guard 
without the State Street staple 
upon their return this fall.
Most patrons of Quickie Burger 
were unaware of the initial closing. 
For Martinez, it was surprising and 
saddening news.

MICHIGAN IN COLOR

Of bridges of “Pasalubong”

My queen, Priyanka 
Chopra is reportedly 
engaged to pop star 
Nick Jonas. As much 
as this news excites 
me, I can’t help but feel 
5,000 more feelings 
than just excitement.
Chopra 
recently 
dropped a Bollywood 
movie 
she 
was 
expected to star in, and 
the director made some 
not-so-subtle 
hints 
that it was because of 
her relationship with 
Jonas. 
Maybe 
this 
means a wedding is 
happening soon and 
that’s great, but to 
me, this seems like 
one more way Chopra 
is distancing herself 
from Bollywood as she 
gains more traction in 
Hollywood.
As a Brown kid 
growing up in the 
diaspora, I spent my 
childhood struggling 
to fit into American 
society 
while 
my 
parents 
desperately 
wanted me to stay 
connected 
to 
our 
Indian 
roots. 
Now 
that I’m older (and 
wiser), I’m committed 
to remain connected 
to my heritage and 
make 
sure 
I 
don’t 
live just an American 
lifestyle. This is why 
Chopra’s relationship, 
and now engagement, 
with 
Jonas 
shook 
me 
to 
my 
core. 
Chopra 
represents 
the 
metaphorical 
bridge 
I 
have 
in 
my 
mind 
between 
American and Indian 
pop culture. Though 
connected, 
I 
view 
them as distinct and 
choose to engage with 
them in very different 
ways. 
For 
example, 
while I don’t really 
bother 
following 
most 
Hollywood 
relationships 
(obviously with the 
exception of Chopra 

and Jonas), I followed 
Sonam 
Kapoor’s 
wedding 
a 
little 
too closely and was 
waaaay too invested in 
every detail When I 
first heard that Chopra 
was 
going 
to 
play 
the 
main 
character 
in ABC’s new show 
“Quantico”, I was so 
excited. 
Seeing 
my 
childhood 
idol 
on 
American 
television 
was 
like 
a 
dream 
come 
true. 
When 
Chopra 
debuted 
on 
American 
television, 
I 
was 
hoping 
she 
would be like a bridge 
between 
Hollywood 
and 
Bollywood. 
But the news of her 
engagement to Jonas 
and pulling out of 
a 
Bollywood 
movie 
has made me feel like 
she’s officially joining 
Team Hollywood and 
leaving her Bollywood 
roots behind.
Also, 
can 
you 
blame me for being 
disappointed 
that 
she’s marrying a white 
dude? Chopra brought 
(more) 
international 
attention to one of 
the many Indian film 
industries (fun fact: 
there are at least 12 
official film industries 
in India), and through 
her interviews, she is 
challenging 
people’s 
view of what life in 
India is like. Chopra’s 
presence in Hollywood 
is significant. It makes 
a statement and she 
makes it very clear 
she does not represent 
the 
entire 
Indian 
subcontinent 
nor 
is 
she willing to act in 
a stereotypical role. 
Her decision to play 
Alex Parrish – a role 
written with a white 
woman in mind – is 
proof of this. So it feels 
like Chopra’s decision 
to marry a white boy 
instead of a desi man 

is another statement 
she’s making to the 
world.
As happy as I am for 
her, I wonder how this 
will change the way 
Chopra is perceived. 
Some people say this 
is a “step up” for 
her, but just because 
someone 
works 
in 
Hollywood, 
that 
doesn’t mean they’re 
“making it.” In fact, 
in terms of numbers, 
the Bollywood film 
industry does better 
than 
Hollywood 
– 
Hollywood 
creates 
about 500 films a year 
while the Indian film 
industry creates over 
1,000 – and Chopra 
was “making it” long 
before she dipped her 
toes in the American 
film 
industry. 
She 
had more successful 
movies under her belt 
prior to “Quantico” 
than some Hollywood 
actors 
have 
in 
an 
entire career. Others 
are disappointed that 
Chopra hasn’t made 
more of a stand now 
that 
she’s 
a 
well-
known Indian actress 
working in the United 
States. My response 
to this is simple: Not 
every icon who’s a 
person 
of 
color 
is 
going to be a champion 
of 
social 
justice 
and 
assuming 
they 
must 
is 
inherently 
problematic (we don’t 
assume every white 
icon is going to care 
about social issues).
Regardless 
of 
Chopra’s 
stand 
on 
different 
issues 
facing 
both 
the 
American and Indian 
film industries, her 
supposed engagement 
to Jonas still makes 
me feel all the feels 
and 
if 
it 
happens, 
this is a wedding I’ll 
definitely be following 
very closely.

 Connecting to the 
Philippines 
and 
my 
identity as a Filipino 
American is something I 
think about nearly every 
single day.
 I have not been back 
to the Philippines lately. 
Though I wish very much 
to make another trip, 
current 
circumstances 
of life do not allow me to 
yet. For now, I let myself 
live vicariously through 
my family and friends 
who have. When my 
mom or dad lands at the 
airport or I reunite with 
my college friends from 
a long-deserved break, I 
relish in the time I have 
with them to listen to 
their adventures in the 
Philippines.
 Sometimes, the stories 
are 
joyful: 
catching 
up 
with 
old 
friends, 
breathing the air of a 
familiar land, exploring 
new 
places. 
But 
sometimes, the stories 
are painful: death, a 
funeral, mourning.
 Amidst the whirlwind 
of 
tales, 
experiences, 
and anecdotes about the 
Philippines, 
an 
array 
of boxes and luggage 
filled 
with 
surprises 
almost always make an 
appearance so suddenly.
Pasalubong.
 In, Tagalog, one of 
the 
main 
languages 
in the Philippines, it 
roughly means souvenir. 
Yet 
similar 
to 
other 
languages, 
English 
fails to fully translate 
its 
significance. 
The 
concept of pasalubong 
is an important aspect 
of 
Filipino 
American 
heritage. 
Pasalubong 

are gifts given to others 
when one comes back 
from a trip. The practice 
of giving and receiving 
may seem simple. After 
all, isn’t it customary to 
give gifts to your loved 
ones? While there might 
be some truth to that, 
pasalubong can be more 
than that. Pasalubong 
may be rooted in the 
idea of reciprocity in 
the Philippine culture. 
The aspect of selfless 
remembrance 
for 
relatives 
and 
friends, 
ecstatic 
welcomes 
for 
one’s 
return 
home, 
and 
perhaps 
an 
unspoken 
expectation 
of a pasalubong could 
possibly convey cultural 
norms 
of 
maintaining 
relationships.
 
And 
though 
the 
word 
pasalubong 
can 
sometimes 
refer 
to 
items from travels of 
any location, pasalubong 
oftentimes relate to gifts 
specifically 
from 
the 
Philippines.
 Pasalubong come as 
they are in many forms 
packed 
in 
cardboard 
boxes and brown paper 
bags. 
They 
are 
the 
delicious dried mangoes 
and garlic corn nuts my 
dad and I love to snack 
on. They are the joggers 
my mom thoughtfully 
bought me for a fraction 
of the price it would be 
in the States and the 
Tagalog 
dictionaries 
packed snugly in her 
luggage 
because 
she 
knows how badly I want 
to be better at speaking. 
They are even the statues 
of the Blessed Mother 
Mary 
that 
watches 

over the homes of my 
extended 
families 
but 
also mine included.
 While the pasalubong 
from my family brings me 
warmth in my heart, the 
pasalubong from friends 
has me feeling thrill and 
adrenaline. 
Pasalubong 
for me is also the comic 
books in Tagalog to help 
me practice the language, 
the fashionable barongs 
perfect for any formal 
occasion, and the books 
on textiles from niche art 
fairs in the Philippines. 
My 
most 
prized 
possessions are fashion 
magazines from Filipinx 
creatives (exhibit A and 
exhibit B)--beacons of 
inspiration to always step 
up my fashion game by 
stretching my creativity. 
I put a great deal of 
importance 
on 
these 
items as they are things 
not accessible online.
 Receiving pasalubong 
from my friends and 
family 
is 
comparable 
to 
getting 
gifts 
on 
Christmas 
(mind 
you 
that Christmas is a big 
deal in Filipino culture). 
Even still, pasalubong is a 
different kind of treasure. 
Pasalubong 
are 
much 
more 
than 
souvenirs. 
They are bridges that 
connect me to many 
parts of my heritage that 
exist oceans away from 
Southeast Michigan. The 
act of giving pasalubong 
is 
a 
cultural 
act 
of 
community building. In 
my view, I am reminded 
to never forget where I 
come from. Pasalubong 
are opportunities to think 
about the intricacies of 
being Filipino American.

SPORTS

For the Michigan wrestling 
team, there will be a stud at 
heavyweight. A tall, built, blonde 
wrestler who dominated in high 
school and is looking to tear up 
the competition in the Big Ten. 
And he is studying to become an 
engineer.
Sound familiar?
That’s 
because 
incoming 
freshman 
Mason 
Parris 
bears 
striking 
resemblance 
in his wrestling trajectory to 
Wolverine legend Adam Coon.
With Coon’s recent departure 
from Ann Arbor, Parris seeks 
to build his craft where Coon 
perfected 
his. 
Parris, 
who 
finished his high school career 
as the No. 1-ranked high school 
heavyweight wrestler, looks to 
continue Michigan’s dominance 
at heavyweight and take the 
torch from Coon.
While the two will not overlap 
a year of eligibility for the 
Wolverines, Parris and Coon will 
still attempt to build a mutually 

beneficial relationship on and off 
the mat.
Their 
relationship 
began 
in earnest when Coon was 
preparing for the World Team 
Trials. In order to help him 
prepare for the best of the best, 
Coon brought in all the help he 
could in an attempt to make the 
World Team. That meant Parris.
So during the week leading 
up to the trials, Parris came up 
to Ann Arbor where he helped 
run a youth wrestling camp and 
assist Coon in his preparation.
“We’d wrestle around a little 
bit, and he would teach me like 
his upper body, like throws,” 
Parris said. “Then when we’d 
live wrestle, I kinda just helped 
him out by being a faster body 
for him and kinda trying to get in 
on his legs so he could fight out 
of it.”
Whatever he did, it worked. 
Coon would then go on to 
triumph over Robby Smith to 
land a spot on the Greco-Roman 
World Team.
“Adam’s been a really good 
mentor to me, and he has really 

helped me out a lot,” Parris said. 
“He’s told me like a lot about the 
system, and he’s a really great 
guy.”
Going forward, Parris hopes 
to maintain his relationship 
with Coon and use his expertise 
on everything from on the 
mat struggles to engineering 
problems.
Parris also hopes to gain 
assistance with his technique. 
Throughout his high school 
career, Parris relied on a unique 
blend of awe-inducing strength 
and 
unrivaled 
quickness 
to 
dominate his high school level 
competition. After all, we’re 
talking about a man who only 
lost once in four years of high 
school 
wrestling, 
capturing 
three state titles and the respect 
of the wrestling community.
Parris 
enjoys 
controlling 
the pace of his matches, often 
electing to push his opponents 
to their limits in terms of tempo 
and physicality. But in order to 
bring that same intensity and 
dominance to the next level, 
every aspect of his game needs 

to be immaculate.
“I 
think 
(the 
Michigan 
coaching 
staff) 
is 
really, 
definitely gonna help me a lot 
with my technique because I still 
have a lot of things to work on 
because I did two other sports, 
and I didn’t wrestle all year-
round,” Parris said, “So I think 
they’re really gonna help me out 
with my technique and help me 
adjust a few things.”
Technique down or not, it 
seems obvious that someone 
with the affinity for wrestling 
like Parris would easily make 
the choice to wrestle at the next 
level. However, that was not 
always his first option. Due to 
his raw athleticism, Parris was 
all-state in three sports and was 
strongly considering collegiate 
football over wrestling.
In the end, Parris went with 
his gut and cited two simple yet 
rational reasons for choosing 
the mat over the gridiron — the 
individualism and success he 
had found with wrestling.
“It was a really tough decision 
for me, but I decided on wrestling 

because I really saw myself being 
a really good wrestler,” Parris 
said, “And then I really liked how 
it was an individual sport and 
how what you put into the sport 
is what you get out of it.”
However, 
Parris’ 
football 
journey may not end in Ann 
Arbor. Many collegiate wrestlers 
have taken their talents to 
the NFL or even garnered 
professional 
interest. 
Most 
recently, certain NFL teams 
have even expressed interest in 
acquiring Coon as an offensive 
lineman.
While he won’t be training 
under 
Michigan 
coach 
Jim 
Harbaugh during his time with 
the Wolverines, the path exists 
for Parris to take football to the 
next level.
But as he’s gotten older, Parris 
has fully adopted every facet of 
the wrestling world. From the 
tight-knit community to the 
brutal physical toll of the sport, 
Parris has embraced it all and 
doesn’t see himself burning out 
anytime soon.
“Well, when I was younger 
I wasn’t like a huge fan of 
wrestling, but I did it still because 
I liked it and I was pretty good at 
it,” Parris said. “But when I got 
older, like around middle school, 
I really developed a love for 
wrestling, and I think it was just 
me winning tournaments and 
stuff that made me really like it 
and all the people I’d meet. I like 
the challenge too.
“I don’t think I’ll ever burn out 
of wrestling because I really love 
it, but I think some challenges 
are gonna be maintaining my 
health.”
As Parris shifts from being a 
part-time to full-time wrestler, 
his mission is clear — maintain 
the 
level 
of 
dominance 
he 
exhibited 
in 
high 
school. 
Attaining the No. 1 ranking in 
anything is never easy, but as 
Parris explains it, that wasn’t the 
difficult part.
“It just makes me drive more 
because they say it’s harder to 
stay on top than to actually get 
there,” Parris said. “So, I really 
worked a lot harder when I saw 
that because I knew I had stuff 
to prove to put me there.”
While the level of competition 
will surely increase as Parris 
heads for the Big Ten, the 
greatest wrestling conference 
in the country, the goal stays 
the same. But with a mentor 
like Coon and the physical tools 
already at his disposal, it’ll be 
hard to bet against this kid.

All good for Rodriguez

JORGE CAZARES
Daily Sports Writer

In the muggy fields of central 
Florida, Roberto Rodriguez takes 
his three kids to their impromptu 
training ground.
Up the hill. Next.
Up the hill. Next.
Up the hill.
The 
three 
future 
collegiate 
ballplayers sprint up the hill adjacent 
to their Monteverde home in a test 
of endurance. Next come the agility 
and speed drills as Roberto times and 
tracks the progress of his athletes. 
Eventually the drills transition to 
the diamond behind their local 
church, where the focus switches 
from building endurance and speed 
to improving fielding, hitting and IQ.
Roberto would create a scenario: 
runners on first and third, one out. 
The ball is hit to you. What do you 
do?
It was this intensity and attention 
to detail on the familiar diamond 
that prepared his players for the 
bigger and unpredictable stages that 
were ahead.
Natalia Rodriguez is the youngest 
and the smallest of the three, but 
from as early as the age of five, 
she was matching her two older 
brothers, stride for stride, drill 
for drill. Through this gauntlet of 
exercises, her competitive nature 
was born.
Rodriguez comes from a baseball 
family. Her father played baseball 
growing up and coached all three 
of his children. Her mother, Iris, 
played softball at Yale, and her 
two brothers, Roberto and Sergio, 
played at Georgetown and Amherst, 
respectively.
As the youngest of three, she 
credits having her two older brothers 
as role models and motivators for the 
level of competitiveness that she now 
exhibits.
“It built up my competitiveness,” 
Rodriguez said. “Just going out there 
trying to be better than the boys.”
Whether 
it 
was 
organized 
drills with her father or a friendly 
exhibition game, she refused to give 
her brothers the edge despite any 
disadvantage she had physically. It is 
the mentality she had as a child and 
one that she carries with her to this 
day.
***
It is easy to mistake physical 
appearance for ability. Picture the 
selection process that takes place 
before a pickup game:
The 
most 
physically 
gifted 
athletes are selected first. Who gets 

picked last? Well, the least imposing 
players, of course.
If 
you 
were 
to 
categorize 
Rodriguez amongst other softball 
players, she would likely fall in the 
latter.
Listed at five-foot four, Rodriguez 
is notably one of the smallest players 
on the field for the Wolverines. But 
petite stature is no new foe for her.
In the seventh grade, Rodriguez 
was playing for her high school team 
at Montverde Academy. She was told 
that she wasn’t big enough or strong 
enough to be a shortstop, so she 
acquiescently made the move to the 
outfield.
“She didn’t want to settle for 
being the littlest one the team,” 
Roberto said. “She wanted to prove 
she could be just as good as anyone 
else. She was always driven, always 
motivated.
“ … I told her to just keep being the 
best player you can be wherever they 
put you.”
And that is exactly what she did.
During her time at Montverde 
Academy, Rodriguez went on to set 
every offensive school record and 
earn numerous awards. She batted 
.506 as a junior and led her team to 
the state championship game. She 
was the defensive MVP at shortstop 
during her sophomore season and 
the team MVP in her junior and 
senior seasons. In her senior season, 
she was also named the Montverde 
Academy 2017 Female Scholar of the 
Year.
“I just went out there and working 
with the team, it was just about 
getting better,” Rodriguez said. “It 
was a … program that pushed us 
and we weren’t –– we grew a lot, 
definitely, since I started playing 
there in middle school.”
Despite initially being moved 
to the outfield in high school, she 
remained in the middle infield for 
her travel team, where Roberto 
coached her from the time she was 
nine until she was 16.
When she was 10, her team 
finished in second at the USSSA/
ESPN 
10U 
World 
Series, 
and 
Rodriguez earned defensive MVP 
honors at shortstop. Three years 
later, her team would win the 2012 
USSSA/ESPN High School World 
Series 16U A Championship –– a 
moment Rodriguez considers the 
biggest of her playing career.
“I was playing with a couple girls 
that I had played with for over four 
or five years,” Rodriguez said, “So 
it was with really close friends of 
mine, and it was in Florida –– Wide 
World of Sports. It was just a great 

atmosphere and I think it was just 
my first big win, so that was pretty 
big for me.”
In 
the 
summer 
before 
her 
freshman campaign, along with 
two of her teammates from the 16U 
World Series squad, she represented 
the Puerto Rican Junior National 
Team, helping her grandparents’ 
native country to a bronze-medal 
finish in the 2017 Junior Women’s 
Softball World Championship.
“It’s always great to represent 
your nationality,” Rodriguez said. 
“It was a lot of fun. You meet a lot 
of girls from the island… And it also 
allowed me to work on my bilingual 
skills.”
The three of them — who were 
the youngest players on that world 
series squad — teamed up one more 
time to compete against countries 
from around the world for the 
international tournament in their 
home state of Florida.
When it came time to be recruited, 
Rodriguez received offers from 
several schools around the country, 
ranging from east coast Ivies to PAC-
12 schools. But it wasn’t until her 
junior year that she received an offer 
from the school she felt was the best 
fit.
“After I got the offer from 
Michigan, I didn’t let anyone else 
get a chance to be quite honest,” 
Rodriguez said.
As the Wolverines said goodbye 
to their switch-hitting shortstop 
and four-year starter Abby Ramirez 
at the end of the 2017 season, they 
welcomed in another switch-hitting 
shortstop in Rodriguez.
In spite of being small and 

frequently overlooked, Rodriguez 
has remained confident in her 
abilities. Or, as her father likes to 
put it, like “a little silent assassin.” 
But make no mistake, this quiet 
confidence is often infused with an 
energizing swagger.
In the clubhouse, she has the 
reputation as the player with 
the most “swag” as some of her 
teammates have put it.
“I think it’s really just me having 
fun –– it’s being me. I like to dance a 
little bit. I think they’re referring to a 
little juju, shoulder lean…its nothing 
crazy… just make people laugh and 
get everyone involved.”
The 
dancing 
simultaneously 
keeps her teammates grounded and 
her swagger-level sky high.
From a young age, she showed 
her dedication to the game and the 
desire to constantly improve. It takes 
this sort of approach to the game 
to remain passionate and hungry. 
Some athletes eventually fall out of 
love with the game, burnt out from 
the years of dedication. But not 
Rodriguez.
“Can’t say (quitting softball) 
crossed my mind,” Rodriguez said.
From the diamonds of Montverde, 
Fla. to Ann Arbor, Mich., Rodriguez 
has found her way to always enjoy 
the game.
***
Last 
season, 
fans 
became 
accustomed to seeing the slick-
fielding 
freshman 
ranging 
the shortstop position for the 
Wolverines. She has become a 
staple of the Michigan defense 
— which ranked first in the Big 
Ten and second in the nation in 

fielding percentage through the 
end of the regular season. But she 
wasn’t supposed to be the starting 
shortstop. Sophomore third baseman 
Madison Uden was slated as the 
likely candidate be the everyday 
shortstop by coach Carol Hutchins. 
In the fall, the coaching staff noted 
how talented the freshman could be, 
but it was junior second baseman 
Faith Canfield who saw Rodriguez’s 
potential and vouched for her to get 
the nod next to her in the infield to 
begin the season.
“I think (Canfield)’s the one kid 
in our program that thought Natalia 
was the one to go to shortstop,” 
Hutchins said. “She, from the get-go, 
recognized what a talent Natalia is.”
Canfield took on a mentor role 
last season with Natalia as they 
partnered in the middle infield.
“That’s one thing with Natalia is 
just that she believes in herself and 
knows that she knows how to play 
the game,” Canfield said.
Rodriguez forced Hutchins’ hand, 
expediting what was supposed to be 
a year more for development and 
less for playing time. But it was the 
work ethic and passion for the game 
that her coach and teammates saw in 
her which gave her the opportunity 
to be the starting shortstop –– a 
work ethic and passion that can be 
accredited to her family.
On and off the field, her demeanor 
doesn’t change much: calm, cool and 
collected with a hint of swagger and 
a wide-eyed grin crossing her face.
“I just tell her to smile and have 
fun while you’re out there,” Roberto 
said. “... Nothing but good will come 
out of it.”

Before 
signing 
a 
two-way 
contract with the Miami Heat, 
before barraging the NBA Summer 
League with 3s and even before he 
was a key cog in Michigan’s run to 
the NCAA championship game, 
Duncan Robinson met Michigan 
assistant coach Luke Yaklich — 
and went straight to work.
As one of the architects of 
Michigan’s recent run to the 
NCAA 
championship 
game, 
Yaklich picked apart hours of film 
with the fifth-year senior forward. 
He knew that Robinson would be 
vital to the Wolverines’ offense as 
a capable 3-point shooter. At the 
same time, Yaklich recognized 
that the 2017-18 incarnation of 
Michigan 
basketball 
couldn’t 
necessarily just run-and-gun its 
way to success like past Wolverine 
teams under John Beilein.
“He just asked me ‘What do I 
need to do to get better?’,” Yaklich 
said. “I kind of will always 
remember that. We talked about 
things that we could do against 
certain teams and he just had this 

presence of mind about him and a 
understanding of basketball. His 
basketball acumen is really high.”
To 
make 
the 
plan 
work, 
Robinson — and everyone else 
on the roster — had to embrace 
the defensive side of the ball. 
Originally, the plan was to start 
freshman Isaiah Livers at power 
forward over Robinson. While 
Livers showed early flashes of 
defensive 
versatility, 
he 
had 
a hard time initially grasping 
Michigan’s offensive scheme, so 
the Wolverines went ahead and 
started Robinson.
Robinson though, struggled to 
find his shot during the start of 
Big Ten play, ceding the starting 
job back to Livers. Against No. 5 
Michigan State on Jan. 13, Livers 
made his first start, helping the 
Wolverines to an 84-75 win. As 
Michigan marched on, Robinson 
finally faced the reality of playing 
from the bench.
“That 
season 
epitomized 
growth… to the team but also 
to 
myself,” 
Robinson 
said. 
“Specifically 
as 
a 
leader, 
I 
definitely had my ups and my 
downs over the course of the 
year,” Robinson said. “But I 

tried to stay true to my law as an 
adapter and a guy who had been 
through more to help out these 
younger guys.”
And despite his reduced role, 
Robinson kept finding new ways 
to contribute. Sophomore guard 
Zavier Simpson’s dogged man-
to-man 
defense 
and 
redshirt 
sophomore 
wing 
Charles 
Matthews’ lanky-armed steals 
might be easier to see, but it was 
Robinson who was Yaklich’s self-
described defensive “sounding 
board.” Robinson would bounce 
ideas back and forth with the coach 
on how to improve Michigan’s 
defense, then adopt what he had 
gleaned onto the court. Robinson 
and senior guard Muhammad-
Ali Abdur Rahkman even called 
out other teams’ offensive plays, 
according to Yaklich.
“I know there was a point, it 
was in the middle to second half 
of the conference season,” Yaklich 
said. “There was just a confidence 
about him that no matter who 
he was guarding, whether it was 
(Ohio State forward) Keita Bates-
Diop or a more physical 4-man 
in our league, Duncan was going 
to be a chameleon and adjust to 

however that particular opponent 
needed to be played.”
In a crucial road game at 
Penn State, Robinson racked up 
a Wolverine career-high three 
blocks. As the primary defender, 
he 
limited 
Bates-Diop, 
the 
eventual Big Ten Player of the 
Year, to 5-17 shooting in a win 
over Ohio State. Michigan held 
its opponents to 62.0 points per 
game during its 14-game win 
streak that led the Wolverines 
to the Final Four. Robinson even 
rediscovered his shooting stroke 
to the tune of 44 percent shooting 
from behind the arc in February 
and March and was named the Big 
Ten’s Sixth Man of the Year. 
Still, Robinson wasn’t done. It 
was time to take his shooting and 
his defensive growth to the NBA, 
even if he wasn’t as heralded as 
some of his peers that declared for 
the draft. All of the teams he had 
official pre-draft workouts with 
— the Philadelphia 76ers, Golden 
State Warriors and Los Angeles 
Lakers — employed schemes that 
rely on spacing, shooting and 
value help defense. So far, so good.
While training in the Los 
Angeles area though, the Heat 
sent one of its scouts to look at 
Robinson. After a solid workout, 
Robinson 
was 
intrigued. 
He 
knew that the Miami had a lot 
of previous success with player 
development 
— 
guard 
Josh 
Richardson was a crucial piece 
for the Heat immediately as 
a second round pick, and the 
coaching staff revived the careers 
of former journeymen like center 
Hassan Whiteside and forward 
James Johnson. Even his former 
Michigan 
teammate, 
guard 
Derrick Walton Jr., was on the 
team.
“It’s not every day that one of 
your good friends has had that 
same experience that, as you are 
about to go through,” Robinson 
said.
Although Robinson ended up 
going undrafted, he knew where 
to go next. When Heat head 
coach Erik Spoelstra first talked 
to Robinson about potentially 
playing 
for 
Miami’s 
Summer 
League team, Robinson was sold.
Spoelstra pitched Robinson as 
a player who could fit the same 
mold as Heat shooting guard 
Wayne Ellington — a player who 
bounced around the league for 
eight years before signing with 
Miami and finishing sixth in the 
NBA in three pointers made last 
season.
“[Spoelstra] really likes guys 
that shoot the ball, and how 

they 
prioritize 
that 
within 
the organization and how my 
combination of size and skill 
could maybe help them in games,” 
Robinson said. “So they used the 
example of Wayne Ellington and 
how he’s always encouraged him 
to shoot and stay invested. And 
it’s not necessarily about how 
many makes, but he’s just always 
encouraging and that to get them 
off in there. That’s what every 
shooter wants to hear.”
Robinson 
won’t 
necessarily 
have as many responsibilities in 
the NBA as he did at Michigan. 
At least in the beginning of his 
career, his success will hinge on 
being in the right place at the 
right time. In his first Summer 
League game Robinson had a 
largely uneventful performance, 
going 1-4 from behind the arc and 
finishing with three points.
Fast forward to the next game, 
though, 
and 
Robinson 
found 
himself channeling his inner 
chameleon in the same way that 
he did at Michigan. On the first 
Heat possession of the game, 
Miami’s Bam Adebayo grabbed 
an offensive rebound and kicked 
the ball out to the top of the arc, 
where it effortlessly fell into 
the waiting hands of Robinson. 
Casually, Robinson pulled up and 
sunk the 3-pointer.
On the ensuing Heat possession, 
Robinson glided up the floor on a 
fastbreak, corralled in an outlet 
pass and, barely touching the ball, 
feathered in another deep 3 — 
two minutes later, another triple, 
from the same spot as the first 
one. Later in the first half, he even 
slipped a screen, and jammed a 
powerful two hand baseline dunk 
off a pass from Walton Jr.
Robinson finished the game 
with 19 points, adapting his game 
like he had at Michigan, this time 
on a more micro level.
It’s easy to mistake Robinson’s 
performance that day — and the 
ensuing ones in Las Vegas — as 
one of many Summer League hot 
shooting streaks that end up dying 
without so much as a whimper 
in 
the 
G-League. 
For 
every 
Manu Ginobili, there are twenty 
Anthony 
Randolphs 
or 
Josh 
Selbys that burn out. Like many 
of the great undrafted players 
before him, however, Robinson 
knows his role and has shown 
a willingness and the ability to 
revamp and add to his game when 
things aren’t going right.
“It was never a question mark 
of what was going to happen,” 
Yaklich said. “We knew we were 
going to get the best out of him.”
