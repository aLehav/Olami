Pescovitz's appointment is
contingent upon final approval
by the Board of Regents at its
monthly meeting on March 19.
If the regents approve Pescovitz
for the position, she will suc-

FUNDING HIGHER EDUCATION
Coleman: timuluss impact undear

President told faculty
body that funding total
may not be known for
the next few months'
ByKYLE SWANSON
Daily StaffReporter
In a meeting yesterday, University
President Mary Sue Coleman said she's
not certain how much funding the Uni-
versity will receive from the stimulus

package, but said plans are underway in
case additional money is received.
While answering questions from
members of the Senate Advisory Com-
mittee on University Affairs, Coleman
said University administrators are cur-
rently working on next year's budget
and preparing for a possible influx of
money from the recently passed $787
billion federal stimulus package. How-
ever, Coleman said she is not certain if
any stimulus money directed to the state
will actually be given to the University.
"What I don't understand is whether
any money from the state ... will actually

come to universities, or will all of that
be reserved for K-12 or will that all be
reserved for infrastructure," she said.
Coleman said the University has
already proposed $300 million in pos-
sible capital projects at all of the Univer-
sity's campuses that could net stimulus
funds from the state. She added, though,
that the state hasn't released any funds
to the University for construction proj-
ects in several years.
Although many details remain
unclear, Coleman said if the state accepts
the federal stimulus money, one of the
stipulations of the bill is that Michigan

legislators mustagree not to cut the Uni-
versity's funding.
"If the state accepts the stimulus
money, the budgets of the University
cannot be cut below their 2008 levels,"
she said.
Coleman said while this is good news,
the University's funding is much lower
than in previous years, despite rising
cost factors like inflation.
"Not only have they not increased our
operating budget, it has been decreas-
ing,"shesaid."WhenIcameherein2002,
state allocation was about $365 million.

Undergraduate

of annual awards
By JOHN A. WEISS, JR.
For theDaily
In recognition of the fact that
outstanding faculty are essential
to any successful university, five
professors were recently award-
ed Arthur F. Thurnau Professor-
ships by the University.
At its February meeting, the
University Board of Regents
named Charles Bright, August
Evrard, Andrei Markovits, James
Walsh, and Margaret Wooldridge
as this year's recipients of the pro-
fessorship. The award is given to

faculty members for outstanding
contributions to undergraduate
education at the University.
The Office of the Provost's
website says the award honors
tenured faculty "whose com-
mitment to and investment in
undergraduate teaching has had
a demonstrable impact on the
intellectual development and
lives of their students."
Recipients of the award also
receive a $20,000 grant to aid
their teaching.
The honorary title remains
with professors for the duration
of their time at the University.
Evrard, professor of phys-
ics and astronomy, said he was
"pleasantly surprised," to learn
of his award.

Serving hungry students with a smile

Quickie Burger owner
Kerope Arman has seen his
fair share of intoxicated stu-
dents with the munchies for
fast food. Conveniently locat-
ed at the intersection of Hill
Street and State Street, the
maize-and-blue interior of
Quickie Burger is a common
last stop for students getting
back from a night out, and the
popularity hasn't declined
sihce the restaurant started
serving alcohol in January.
"They've always patron-
ized at night, because they're
always around, 12 o'clock,
one o'clock, two o'clock,"
Arman said about students.
Now 60 years old, Arman
said the restaurants unusu-
ally young and collegiate cli-
entele make him feel young
again.
"Well, for an old man it's
totally different, you feel

elated, and you feel young
because when you're 60
years old, and you're sur-
rounded by 18, and 20, and
22-year-olds, you feel a little
bit younger, so for me it's a
nicer atmosphere."
Quickie Burger, famed
for its controversial logo of a
scantily clad woman riding a
hamburger, also has a special
place in campus life on foot-
ball Saturdays when "proba-
bly 50,000 people" passby on
thestreet outside the restau-
rant, according to Arman.
"Football Saturdays are
just phenomenal, I mean in
the way of volume. It's very
hectic from the beginning
of morning until six, seven
o'clock at night. They tail-
gate prior, they tailgate after.
It's nice to see people having
fun," Arman said.
Arman, who has owned

Quickie Burger for one yea
and whose son and wife als
help run the restaurant, onl
had positive things to sad
about the students who mak
up a large proportion of th
restaurant's patrons.

No SOS response
from two missing

The Coast Guard says it has nar-
rowed the search area for two NFL
players and another man whose

Coast Guard Capt. Timothy
Close says the search area is "sub-
stantially smaller," based on where
they found the boat and a survivor

covered 16,000 square miles.

WASHINGTON
Gov't moves to aid
AIG with $30B,
for a second time
A new definition of desperate
times: Even as the government
threw a stunning new $30 billion
lifeline to American International
Group on Monday, the beleaguered
insurance giant confirmed it had
lost more than twice that much,
$62 billion, in a single three-month
period.
And many more billions of feder-
al dollars are almost sure to be shov-
eled into the company for a simple
reason: Officials fear its collapse
would cripple financial markets in
the U.S. and around the world.
The source of trouble for AIG,
which has 74 million customers
worldwide and operations in more
than 130 countries, is its business
insuring mortgage-backed securi-
ties and other debt against default.
That business imploded once the
credit crisis struck with force.
The government has now made
four separate efforts to save the com-
pany, totaling more than $170 billion.

Gov. Jindal defends
message of his GOP
Widely panned for his national
TV address, Louisiana Gov. Bobby
Jindal offered his first defense
of the speech Monday, saying
he sticks by the message, while
acknowledging shortcomings in
his delivery.
"Look, I get that people thought
I could have spoken better. I get
that. That's fine ... What's impor-
tant to me is the content. I'm a pol-
icy guy. You guys know that. I've
always been a policy guy, always
will be a policy guy. The ideas
are important. The substance is
important," Jindal told reporters
in the state Capitol, a day after

returning from a family vacation.
The 37-year-old governor, regu-
larly touted as a presidential con-
tender, said he outlined a critical
philosophical distinction between
theviewsofDemocrats andRepub-
licans as he gave the national GOP
response to Obama's first address
to Congress last week.
Republican party leaders have
touted the Oxford-educated Jin-
dal, son of Indian immigrants, as
the future of the GOP, generating
lofty expectations for his debut
national address. Jindal said he
wrote the speech himself.

Raul Castro ousts
top Cubans loyal

President Raul Castro abruptly
ousted some of Cuba's most power-
ful officials Monday, remaking the
government in the biggest shakeup
since he took over from his ailing
brother Fidel Castro a year ago.
The changes replaced some key
Fidel loyalists, including the long-
time foreign minister, with men
closer to Raul. They also reduced
the enormous powers of a vice
president credited with saving.
Cuba's economy after the fall of the
Soviet Union.
But analysts saw no immedi-
ate indication that the changes are
related to hopes for closer U.S.'
Cuban ties now that both countries

NEW YORK (AP) - A relentless

day blew through barriers that
would have been unthinkable just

there was no reason tobelievebuy-
ers will return anytime soon.
The Dow Jones industrialaver-
age plummeted below 7,000 at
the opening bell and kept driving
lower all day, finishing at 6,763 -
a loss of nearly 300 points. Each
of the 30 stocks in the index lost
value for the day.

Wolk not only excelled on
paper, but also in the classroom.
"What was remarkable about
Prof. Wolk was how she managed
a perfect mixture of encourage-
ment and guidance in her discus-
sions," according LSA sophomore
Michael Vickers, who previously
had Wolk as an instructor.
Vickers said that Wolk didn't
simply listen to a discussion and
bend it back to her original out-
line. Instead, he said Wolk would

Investors were worried anew
about the stability of the finan-
cial system after insurer Ameri-
can International Group posted
a staggering $62 billion loss for
the fourth quarter, the biggest
in U.S. corporate history - and
accepted an expanded bailout
from the government.
. But beyond daily headlines,
Wall Street seems to have given
up the search for a reason to
believe that the worst is over and
the time is ripe to buy again.
"As bad as things are, they can
still get worse, and get a lot worse,"
said Bill Strazzullo, chief market
strategist for Bell Curve Trading,
who said hehbelieves the Dow might
fall to 5,000 and the S&P to 500.
The Dow's descent has been
breathtaking. It took only 14

of Wolk's courses, added, "she

but encouraged and welcomed all.
of our own thoughts on the nov-
els."
According to her colleagues,
Wolk's enthusiasm was rooted in
her true passion for literature.
"To say that Merla loved litera-
ture understates the case," said
English Prof. George Bornstein.
"She lived and breathed literature
as a natural part of her life."
Bornstein, who became very
close with Wolk during her more
than 20 years at the Univer-
sity, said that he felt that Wolk
"brought out the best in her col-
leagues, and they knew it."
Adela Pinch, an associate pro-
fessor in the English Department,
was one of those colleagues who
felt impacted by Wolk's generos-
ity and advice.

to fall from shove 8,000 to helow
7,000. For the year, the Dow has
lost 23 percent of its value.
Its last close below 7,000 was
May 1, 1997 - a time when the
market was barreling to one
record high after anotherbecause
of the boom in technology stocks,
but often suffered big drops as
investors worried about inflation
and rising interest rates.
This time around, Wall Street'
analysts seem to believe that a
stock market recovery will first
require signs of health among
financial companies, and on
Monday those signs seemed fur-
ther away than ever.
AIG, whose reach is so vast
that the government warns let-
ting it fail would cripple the very
world financial system, will get
another $30 billion in loans on
top of the $150 billion already
invested by the government.
"I will always remember an
important moment," said Pinch,
"when I consulted her about my
struggles with an essay about
George Eliot I was trying to write.
She patiently listened to all my
ideas, and then said, with just a
touch of impatience, 'just start
writing!' I know that decades of
students had similar experiences
with her, learning from her to
have faith in their ideas about lit-
erature."
As a student who had the plea-
sure of being in Wolk's classroom
twice, LSA sophomore Laura
Winnick said Wolk asked a lot of
her students. But as a result, stu-
dents not only grew as writers,
but as people, she said.
"It was her constant push, her
perpetual challenge to her stu-
dents to understand and appreci-
ate the books we read that made
her an incredible teacher and
inspiring person," said Winnick.

Pescovitz currently serves as the
executiveassociate dean for research
affairs and interim vice president for
research administration at the Indi-
ana University School of Medicine
and is president and CEO of the Riley
Hospital for Children.
She is a graduate of the North-
western UniversityMedical School
and is a well-recognized pediatric
endocrinologist. She has published
approximately 180 manuscripts
and books with her research,
which focuses on certain causes
and therapies for growth disorders
and puberty conditions.
In an e-mail sent to faculty and
students this morning, Coleman
said Pescovitz is an excellent choice
to head UMHS, especially with the
new opportunities the purchase of
the Pfizer Inc. complex will present.
"The recent decision to purchase
the former campus of Pfizer Inc.
presents the University with tre-
mendous options for growth and
impact in scientific research," Cole-
man wrote. "The research enter-
prise of our Health System is vital to
this expansion, and Dr. Pescovitz is
an exceptional choice for advancing
our scholarship and discoveries."
University officials announced
their intention to purchase the
Pfizer property, which was vacated
in 2008, at the December meeting
of the Board of Regents.
Speaking before the Senate
Advisory Committee on Univer-
sity Affairs yesterday, Coleman
stressed Pestovitz's qualifications
and praised her as a good choice
for the position.
"Oneofthethingsthatimpressed'

lion) or $325 million."
Coleman said that some of the
money from the stimulus package
will alsobe givento federal agencies
that would then release the funds in
the form ofcompetitive grants.
"There's money, that federal
agencies will get that we will then
have the possibility to compete
for," she said.
The University is also very con-
scious that any stimulus moneyis a
one-time allocation that should be
used for one-time expenses, Cole-
man said.
"The one thing that we have
been talking about, and I think
it's a very important principle,
that fhe University has adhered to
ever since I've been here and when
we've had to deal with budget cuts,
is that we have not used one-time '
money for ongoing costs," she said.

to reach out far beyond the college
of medicine," Coleman said of Pes-
covitz's time at Indiana University.
"(She) comes to us with an enor-
mous amount of experience."
In a statement released by
UMHS, Pescovitz said she is excit-
ed and honored to lead UMHS.
"It is a time of great challenges
in the economy and health care,
as well as a time of unprecedent-
ed opportunities in biomedical
research," she wrote in'the state-
ment. "I'm looking forward to
working with the extraordinary
team at one of the nation's finest
universities to meet these chal-
lenges and opportunities."
Provost Teresa Sullivan, who
headedthe searchcommittee,wrote
in a statement that she felt Pescovitz
was a strong choice for the job.
"Dr. Pescovitz is a talented
researcher, a skilled clinician and
an experienced administrator who
brings vision and commitment to
her work," Sullivan wrote.."This
combination of qualities will make
her an effective leader at the Uni-
versity of Michigan."
Kelch was also very supportive
of the choice of Pescovitz.
"As a pediatric endocrinologist
myself, I have admired her and
been amazed by her accomplish-
ments," he wrote in a statement. "I
am confident in her ability to lead
our Health System to new heights."
Pescovitz is married to hus-
band Mark Pescovitz, who is an
organ transplant surgeon, profes-
sor of surgery and microbiology
and immunology and vice chair
of research for the Department of
Surgery at the Indiana University
School of Medicine. The couple has
three children.
"We don't want to introduce a
structural deficit that we will have
to pay the piper on in a few years."
Coleman also discussed Gov.
Jennifer Granholm's call on state
universities not to raise tuition next
year, inan effort to aid families who
may be suffering financially. Cole-
man added that there have been
discussions within the University
about a possible tuition freezer
"In her State of the State address,
she did ask universities to consider
the possibility of freezing tuition,"
she said. "I have a different view-
point here because I try to look at
any circumstance where artificial
cost hasn't created acrisis down the
road, so I don'tunderstand that."
In the end, Coleman told SACUA
members that more information,
about the budget and funding lev-
els will be clarified over the next
few months.
"I don't anticipate that much of
this will become very clear for the
next few months," she said. "We
just want to be ready."

compares the Thurnau Professor-
ship to hitting the trifecta.
"I love every aspect of my job,"
he said, adding that the University
has been very good to him.
"Love what you do, and do it
with passion and with dedication
and it will be fun," said Walsh,
who knew that he wanted to be a
professor since his junior year at
Columbia University.
Walsh is the Gerald and Esther
Carey professor of business
administration, a professor of
management and organizations
and bprofessor of strategy in the
Stephen M. Ross School of Busi-
ness. He said he was deeply hon-
ored to be a recipient of a teaching
award.
"I'm pleased because I really
do pour my heart and soul into my
teaching," Walsh said.
He also wanted to remind stu-
dents to take advantage of the
University not only as a place to
gain the accumulated wisdom of
previous generations, but also as a
place of inquiry.
"Sometimes with all of the
pressure for grades we lose sight

of what is really at play. This is not
all about digesting facts and the
like. I fear that some people mis-
take their performance on assign-
ments and tests as the mark of a
good education. Education is all
about inquiry," Walsh said.
Walsh said he plans to use the
grant money to take his classes to
China to investigate global cor-
porate governance, something he
has done in the past.
"I'm always looking for funding
to be able to do that," he said. "My
orientation is tospend the money
on the students somehow."

to give back to a campus that he
gained so much from in his under-
graduate days.

"I think this is a great additio
to the Greenbelt program," sai
Ann Arbor City Councilmembe
Carsten Hohnke (D-Ward 5).
Hohnke added that the pur-
chaseofthe developmentrights
of the Webster Township land
will help to create an excess of
400 acres of farmland in the
Greenbelt holdings.
Mayor John Hieftje was
equally excited about the
purchase. He said that land
protection and an increased
emphasis on local agriculture
will become more important in
the years to come as transpor-
tation costs increase.
"There's no reasonwhyyears
later this land can't be used for
local agricultural growth," he
said.
Another environmental
issue discussed at the meeting
was a proposal to ban plastic
shoppingbags in the city, which
was first introduced by Coun-
cilmember Stephen Rapundalo
(D-Ward 2) in a meeting last
June.
City Council later tabled the
proposal to allow for a period
of public comment.
Last night council members
unanimously voted to post-
pone action on the ban until
June 1 in order to enable more
discussion between city staff
and local retailers.
"There's still a little hit more

n
id
r

work to do at this time," said
Rapundalo.
If the ordinance is approved,
stores that gross more than $1
million annually will be prohib-
ited from distributing plastic bags
to customers at checkout.
In a previous interview with
the Daily, Rapundalo said that

the $1 million limit will target
larger-grossing businesses and
protect smaller local businesses
that can't afford alternatives to
plastic.
He added that the reason for
the ban was to stop the prolifera-
tion of plasticbags floating around
the city.

Granting wishes
Ann Arbor must receive its share of stimulus money
hile many students are wishing for warmer weather
on campus, the city has come up with a wish list of its
own. Last week, the Ann Arbor City Council released
a prioritized list of programs it hopes Michigan's share of the
recently passed federal stimulus bill will fund. Though the list of
projects ranges greatly, they tend to have one thing in common
- they ought to be funded by the bill. Funding these projects
will accomplish precisely what the stimulus bill aims to do: cre-
ate jobs, stimulate the economy and improve the local communi-
ty. State and local government should coordinate their efforts to
provide stimulus funding for the projectsthat Ann.Arbor's city
council has outlined.

First on the wish list are repairs for Sta-
dium Boulevard, which is worse for the
wear after years of federal neglect. The
southern lanes on the road's bridge have
been entirely closed, because the beam that
supports that part of the bridge, according
to Ann Arbor City Councilmember Leigh
Greden, is deteriorating. It's unacceptable
for bridges in Michigan - or anywhere, for
the matter - to be allowed to reach such
a state of near-collapse. Luckily, the city
expects to receive money for this project,
and it should. Communities deserve the
money they need to make roads like this
one safe for residents.
The city is also requesting funding so
that it can provide better insulation in low-
income homes. Insulating these homes
would help reduce utility bills and put
money in the pockets of people who really
need it, year after year. Not only would this
save energy, this program would also allow
these individuals to spend more money in
the local community. It's disappointing
that the city may not receive funding for
this program. While it's true that other
communities may need the money more,
the federal and state governments ought
to provide enough money to ensure that
affordable, properly equipped housing is

readily available to low-income individu-
als in every community.
Other priorities for the city include
installing new traffic lights and creating
bicycle lanes along Fifth and Division Street.
Adding bicycle lanes is likely to create jobs
during construction, improve traffic con-
ditions and make it safer for bike-riders to
get around in the city. Not to mention that
it would encourage the use of bikes, helping.
to make the city greener and less congested.
Similarly, the city's plan to install LED traf-
fic lights would make the city more sustain-
able. officials hope they can use stimulus
funding to replace all of the city's traffic
lights with energy-efficient LED lights. This
project would save the city thousands of
dollars on its energy bills, freeing up money
for other activities. It would also reduce
energy consumption, placing less stress on
the environment, making this a wise invest-
ment for stimulus funding.
It's clear that the city can't afford to
postpone these programs. Creating a sus-
tainable city with well-kept infrastructure
and properly insulated housing is a wor-
thy cause for stimulus money. Like many
other cities in Michigan, this city deserves
to have its most important financial needs
met with federal dollars.

TO THE DAILY:
Professor Juan Cole delivered a lecture in
February entitled "Collective Action in Ameri-
can Iraq: Can the People Thwart Empire?"
Attempting to cover the event, the Daily article
(Cole discusses role of militants inIraq, 02/19/09)
failed to address some of Cole's more pertinent
points.
For those that missed out and want to know,
here they are:
First, Paul Bremer, head of the Coalition
Provisional Authority of the U.S. Secretary
of Defense, issued his 100 Orders, or "Bremer
Plan," in 2003. It mandated the privatization
of Iraq's 200 state-owned oil reserves and pro-
tection for foreign investors and contractors.
It also called for the "de-Baathification" of
the Iraqi government in favor of a secular one.
Unfortunately for the Bush administration,
these orders did not go according to plan.
Second, part of U.S. strategy in the Middle
East, Cole argued, was a continuation of Cold
War policies - namely, the conversion of some
of the world's last socialist strongholds into
U.S. friendly markets. With the Soviet Union
out of play, the Bush administrations figured
they would give global domination another go.
Third, only 14 percent of Iraqis actively sup-
ported resistance against American troops in
2003; by 2006, 75 percent wanted to kill U.S.
troops.
Fourth, while Obama's "instincts are good"
when it comes to Iraq and imperialism in
general, he is "tone-deaf" when it comes to
Afghanistan.
Cole's closing point presented a nice summa-
ry of his argument: There is generally a battle
between social and diplomatic history. In Iraq,
social history won.

TO THE DAILY:
I was visitingmy soninAnnArborwhenIread
Matthew Green's column (A greed-fueled culture,
02/16/2009). Ironically, like Mr. Green, I also
passed a homeless man on my way to the Union
on State St. Instead ofwantingto give him money,
however, I wished I could give him a job. In fact,
many of the "greedy" business people that Mr.
Green cites in his article have provided jobs for
hundreds of people.
A recent article in the Detroit News talks about
the new leader of the Michigan Republican Party,
Ron Weiser (Ann Arbor mogul takes reins of GOP,
02/21/2009). He graduated in 1966 from the Uni-
versity of Michigan with a business degree. But,
unlike many of our "leaders" in Congress, he does
not have a graduate degree. His Ann Arbor-based
real estate firm currently manages more than
$2.2 billion in assets across the country. Some
people may call that "greedy". However, who
knows how many people Weiser prevented from
being homeless because he provided them with a
job? He did not do this out of sympathy. Weiser
needed construction workers to build his offices,
secretaries to run them and real estate agents to
sell real estate.
The legislators on Capital Hill do not have
any money to create jobs. They use our taxpay-
ers' money and decide how and where to spend
that money, based on public policies. I do not
think Thomas Jefferson would fund a School of
Public Policy. His own policy was one of "laissez
faire" - letting the people be. When people are
allowed to make their own decisions, some may
succeed and some fail. But everyone in America
has the opportunity to learn from their mistakes
and try again. When Americans do succeed, they
provide jobs and ample opportunities for other
Americans.

The Obama administration promises to change Ameri-
ca's impact on the environment - but the environmentalist
movement is a serious danger to mankind Unfortunately,
whenever I voice this concern, people act as if I'm com-
mitting a mortal sin. Their initial shock is quickly fol-
lowed by an angry barrage of arguments: "Don't you care
about the earth?" "We need to leave an untouched planet
for future generations - think about the children!"
Make no mistake, I value the environment. I value it as a
tool to be used by man to enhance his existence. But frank-
ly, I care more about people than I care about nature.
It seems to me that environmentalism's ultimate aim
is nothing more than the destruction of civilization and
the reduction of mankind to a primitive, animal-like
state. The majority of activities that the environmental-
ists oppose are life-enhancing for humans. For example,
environmentalists have fought against logging in New
Hampshire, which allows for job creation and provides
raw materials for housing. They have opposed drilling for
oil in Alaska and the mining of tar sands in Canada, both
of which reduce energy prices and lower our dependence
on oil from the Middle East. They also object to the use
of sand on winter roads in Seattle, which helps to prevent
traffic accidents and save lives.
The environmental movement's contempt for man
can be traced back to its philosophical underpinnings.
Environmentalists subscribe to the idea that the envi-
ronment has intrinsic value. In other words, they believe
that nature is automatically valued, with or without the
existence of man. This is precisely why environmental-
ists oppose mankind's destruction of wetlands but not the
natural destruction of wetlands. It's also why they oppose
the building of a manmade dam but not a dam built by a
beaver. Mankind's disturbance of the inherent "goodness"
of nature is seen as wrong and, ultimately, as immoral.
I'm sure you've heard that it's good to reduce your
"environmental footprint." Since man can only survive
by changing nature to fit his needs, he must intrude on
its inherent "goodness" in order to survive. This is pre-
cisely why man must have a "footprint" in order to live as
a man. We must alter the environment in order to grow
food, build a house, produce clothing and fulfill even the
most basic of human needs. Given the requirement that
man must alter nature to survive, the environmental
movement's demand that we keep nature pristine is anti-
mankind.

Still in denial? You wouldn't be the only one. Earth
First! Journal editor John Davis says, "Human beings,
as a species, have no more value than slugs." Former Vice
President and environmental movement leader Al Gore
explains an ethical dilemma in his book Earth in the Bal-
ance: "The Pacific Yew can be cut down and processed
to produce a potent chemical, taxol, which offers some
promise of curing certain forms of lung, breast and ovar-
ian cancer in patients who would otherwise quickly die.
It seems an easy choice - sacrifice the tree for a human
life until one learns that three trees must be destroyed
for each patient treated." Only the twisted philosophy of
environmentalism could make Mr. Gore think thatkilling
three trees to save a human life is a difficult choice.
So what does President Obama think of such an evil
philosophy? Unfortunately, he fully embraces it. Obama
wants to force a cap-and-trade plan on Americans that
will limit their energy usage at the expense of their stan-
dard of living. His plan will extort over $150 billion from
energy companies over the next ten years. Once in pos-
session of this money, he claims he will invest it into new
"green energy" - something that has proved so unprofit-
able thus far that private investors won't touch it without
substantial government incentives. In fact, most "green
energy" companies can't survive without the taxpayer-
funded subsidies required to keep them afloat. Obama has
promised to double automotive fuel economy standards
within 18 years, which will undoubtedly make cars more
expensive to produce and thus more expensive to buy. It
will also force manufacturers to make lighter, less crash-
worthy vehicles, which have been shown to increase acci-
dental deaths. How many more people will die in traffic
accidents so that we can decrease our carbon footprint?
It's time for students at the University of Michigan
(and across the country) to realize the depravity of the
environmentalist philosophy and its manifestation in
American politics under the Obama administration. The
philosophythat underlies environmentalism is inherently
evil because it regards mankind as a problem and nature
as good, apart from its value to man. So, when you think
about attending "Earth Hour" on Mar. 28, make sure you
understand that turningoffyourlights issymbolic of what
environmentalists and apparently the Obama administra-
tion want: a return to the Stone Age.

Award-nominated French
melodrama is as engaging
as it is confusing
By BLAKE GOBLE
Daily Arts Writer
Last year's French melodrama "I've Love
You So Long" is difficult to understand with
out being a parent.
The film's plot revolves
around the death of a young
child and its resolution is so
contentious it's difficult to I've Love
say if the movie is any good
or not. The film is hard to YOU SO LON
understand, as it is driven At the
by complicated, parental, Michigan
chain-smoking, progressive
main characters. French Sony
theatrics sure are tough,
eh? But maybe that's not the purpose of thi
film.
"I've Loved You" contains a fascinatin
argument that falters only under its own pre
tenses and first-timer direction.
From what can be understood, the plo
goes like this: Juliette Fontaine (Kristin Scoi
Thomas, "Confessions of a Shopaholic") ha
just been released from prison after a 15-yea
stint. Juliette's much younger sister Lea (Els

fa ily n
Zylberstein, "Modigliani") uneasily takes her
big sis in, which casts a lingering pall that
hangs over her estranged family. Lea has a
husband and two adopted daughters who
meet Juliette with equal parts curiosity and
crossness. And from their familial interac-
tions, we gather Juliette hasn't spoken to her
parents in a long time, as they taught Lea to
pretend Juliette never existed. Why, exactly,
d has Juliette been outcast?
- Juliette killed her 6-year-old son.
The remainder of the film is a kind of
delayed aftermath where scenes and circum-
stances come to fruition as Juliette struggles
to get back to "normal" life. Colleagues judge
her for what she's done, but Juliette bites her
tongue harder than any other person has in
9 his or her life, holding herself back from tell-
ing others about her past. These reactions are
contained 'in a series of moments. But these
moments bring to life an array of conse-
quences and decisions.
"I've Loved You" concerns itself with
is redemption and moving on. It's also about
making choices, understanding your fam-
g ily and, most importantly, being a parent and
- taking that responsibility. Maybe this is why
college students might have trouble under-
at, standing this film.
tt Parents and future parents might find the
is film more interesting, since it provides fine
ir practice in polemics. Why did Juliette kill her
a own child? Can a death ever be justified? What

can we understand about this woman? Shades
of gray, indeed. At first, the film's weakness is
that it has no real goals. But that issue becomes
"I've Loved You's" strength. Through it's open-
ended scenes, the film offers few answers, but
still raises interesting questions. .
One scene in particular, which contains
what might be the most uncomfortable dinner
table ever filmed, shows Juliette making a joke
of her prison sentence as Lea's literati friends
pound her for answers. The party wonders
where Juliette has been for such a long time,
and her shame is apparent as she's forced to
make light of it. Scott Thomas is devastating,
and the scene is just one of many standouts.
The acoustic soundtrack to the film doesn't
always fit, some dramatic beats get screwed
by overacting and the way the film blocks
together the scenes occasionally hurts. Still,
"I've Loved You So Long" is a strong film, with
a stronger lead.
Scott Thomas has been making the rounds
for the last two months as an indie darling.
Nominated everywhere from the BAFTAs to
the Golden Globes, there was soft dismay at
her Oscar snub for this film. She certainly out-
performs Angelina Jolie ("Changeling") in a
similarly maudlin mother role. Mothers must
have it hard, but Scott Thomas excels in her
role with greater responsibilities.
But who cares about the Oscars atthis point?
Scott Thomas is truly affecting and worthy of
praise. Just don't bring kids to this one.

am a poser. As great as being
sad is, faking "sad" while I'm
actually quite happy could
easily be one of my favorite pas-
times. Music can
be a vital acces-
sory for this sort
of psychologi-
cal slumming.
There's some-
thing especially
cathartic about JOSH
sloshingdown
South University
Avenue in the pouringrain (without
a hood on, of course) while listen-
ing to Elliott Smith, assuming the
role of the doomed romantic from
the cozy vantage point of mental
stability. It's a little hobby Ialike to
call "safe depression," offeringbthe
nostalgic wallowing of bleary-eyed
heartache minus all the messy bits.
Likewise, music can be just as
deft at romanticizing actual, honest-
to-God, I-never-want-to-get-out-of-
bed-again misery. Listeningto Jim
Reid of The Jesus & Mary Chain
plaintively croon, "You cut me dead
/you nail me down and kick my
head" can make one's post-breakup
trauma seem significantly less
trivial. Knowing that there's a whole
subculture of open-heart suffering
going on out there mightcmake you
feel like you're part of an elite clique
of broken-down dreamers. This
sonic support system can transform
your achy discontent into something
poetic, lettingyou floatunfettered
in a womb-like void of shared mel-
ancholy. Certain musicians can take
pain and whittle it into something
beautiful and empowering, crafting
bittersweet songs that allow you to
take a step back and view yourself
as the tragic protagonistthat every-
one's rooting for.
So, in the spirit of waning sea-
sonal depression and post-Valen-
tine's Day angst, I have compiled
a completely non-comprehensive
list of songs that perfectly straddle
this happy/sad dialectic. They are
songs that pluck the sweet spot on
your heartstring between euphoria
and hopelessness. Whether you're
happy or sad, these tunes are guar-
anteed to make you feel exactly the
opposite (and then swing you back
around, full circle).
"These Days" - Nico
Although essentially any song
from "The Royal Tenenbaums"
soundtrack could have made it onto
this list, this one is particularly
precious. As Nico spins failure and
stasis into something emotionally
purging, the listener is swept up in
conflicting sentiments of vulnerabil-
ity and invincibility. The rainy-day
twang of the acoustic guitar, swirled
with sweepingstrings and her
inimitable alto, lends the track an
uncanny magic that makes you feel
like you're perched on the edge of
the world, readyto tackle anything.
"When You Sleep" - My
Bloody Valentine
This is shoegaze at its woozi
best; listeningto this song is like
driftingthrough a pastel fever
d'vm- Hm-ail--nMnarin-

and whistle, free-floating around
a sweet tooth melody, perfectly
capturing the half-awake swoon of
puppy love (or its untimely demise).
If you like your exaltation a bit
messy and art-damaged, then this
is your song.
"She's A Jar" -Wilco
As Jeff Tweedy's endearingly
grizzled voice rolls out non-sequi-
turs over a bittersweet stew of
heart-on-sleeve organs and synths,
you'll have to forcibly will your-
self not to get the shivers. With its
evocative free-association lyrics,
the song is like an emotional thrift
shop, shifting meanings to suit the
listener's current plight or day-
dream. During the chorus, when
Tweedy beckons "watch me float-
ing inches above the people under
me" and a wistful harmonica hook
materializes out of the blue, it's
hard not to feel like you're floating
right up there with him.
"Autumn Sweater" - Yo La
Tengo
"Autumn Sweater" could be the
poster child for the tear-blurred
line between happy and sad that
this list is attempting to address.
With his sparse but powerful lyr
ics, Ira Kaplan chronicles three
stages of a relationship in haiku-
Making myself
sad, song by song.
like fashion, jump-cutting from
the disbelief triggered by a knock
on a door to images of forced
smiles and yearning for "the
beginning." And Kaplan's fragile
vocals are sure to prod your nostal-
gia gland, regardless of what stage
of the romantic washing-machine
you're spinning in.
"Here" - Pavement
"I was dressed for success /but
success, it never comes." No band
captured the breezy apathy of'90s
slacker culture as poignantly as
Pavement, but "Here" is frontman
Stephen Malkm'us at his most ten-
der. While he rambles incoherently
about bad jokes and Spanish can-
dles during the verses, the refrain
of "everything's ending here" never
fails to strike a chord.
"Motion Picture Soundtrack"
- Radiohead
This may be simultaneously
one of the saddest and most uplift-
ing songs ever written. It's almost
uncomfortable to listen as Thom'
Yorke warbles, "Red wine and
sleeping pills / help me get back to
your arms / Cheap sex and sad films
/help me get back where I belong"
over a lonely pump organ. But when
the tricklingharps chime in and
Yorke unexpectedly announces in
waif-like falsetto, "I will see you in
the next life," the song crescendos
to an otherworldly optimism that
defies human emotion.
Bayer could really use anumbrella
for those rainy days. If you have one to

ARTS IN BRIEF

Film Review
Fighting to survive
"Street Fighter:
The Legend of Chun-Li"
20th Century Fox
At Showcase and Quality 16
"Street Fighter: The Legend of
Chun-Li" is about Chun-Li (Kristin
Kreuk, TV's "Smallville"). The movie
showcases the same kind of banality
and repetition found in that state-
ment. On top of a horribly uninterest-
ing storyline about a 'girl looking for
her kidnapped father (think "Taken,"
but vice-versa), it uses the franchise
name of "Street Fighter" for a movie
with none of the high-energy action
or character-driven stories associat-
ed with the classic video game. That

is a serious crime. The few fighting
scenes in the movie are trite and per-
functory, dialogue is long and campy
and famous "Street Fighter" charac-
ters are introduced just for the hell of
it with no accompanying background
information.
If this is Capeom's plan to rein-
troduce the franchise to the movie-
watching public, then "Street Fighter"
might be in trouble. In fact, the 1994
"Street Fighter" big-screen adaptation
with Jean-Claude VanDamme is actu-
ally far more entertaining to watch
than "Chun-Li." And that says a lot.
Anyone who remembers the cheesy
fighting sequences and over-the-top
acting from the 1994 film knows that
the producers were at least having
some fun with the material, The same
cannotbe said with "Chun-Li." It's not
fun to watch. It's just sad.

SAID ALSALAH/Daily
Senior Billy Sauer saved all 14 shots he faced in Saturday's 4-0 win against Ferris State, conipleting the sweep of the Bulldogs.
Sauer has strong Senior Night

By CHRIS MESZAROS
Daily Sports Writer
BIG RAPIDS - For a player who
will finish his career third among
Michigan goaltenders in total wins
and total shutouts, it was a fitting
way to finish.
But for senior goaltender Billy
Sauer, who had
his most disap- NOTEBOOK
pointing season
this year, it simply felt good to end
Senior Night with a win.
The senior finished the regular
season with a 4-0 shutout over Fer-
ris State at Yost Ice Arena on Satur-
day. Now with eight shutouts, Sauer
sits behind just Josh Blackburn
(1998-2002) and Al Montoya (2002-
2005) on the Wolverines' all-time
shutout list.
Sauer was at his best in Satur-
day's second stanza. Ferris State's
Casey Hines launched a slapshot
from the blueline through traffic,
but Sauer crouched low enough to
see past the Ferris State screen and
reached out to make the glove save.
Later in the period, Sauer faced
an oncoming breakaway attempt
from Bulldog forward Mike
Embach, who broke away from the
Michigan defense at the blueline
and fired a wrist shot that Sauer
saved with his left pad.

"To have Billy Sauer come in
and get a shutout, that's terrific,"
Michigan coach Red Berenson said.
"Good for our team, good for our
seniors."
And it has certainly been a rough
season for Sauer. He split time with
sophomore goalie Bryan Hogan
until Hogan received the starting
job after the November 21-22 series
against Miami (Ohio) series.
Earlier in the season, Sauer
received little goal support com-
pared to his sophomore counter-
part. The Wolverines have been
shut out three times with Sauer
in net and just once with Hogan.
But lately, Sauer has received the
support needed to win, with the
Wolverines scoring four goals in
both of his last two games, against
Nebraska-Omaha and Ferris State.
He has won all three of his starts
this semester.
BULLDOG BRAWL: At the end of
Saturday's second period, two Wol-
verines saw their Senior Night end
a little early.
During the second period, senior
forward Tim Miller tried to jar a
puck loose from FerrisState goalie
Taylor Nelson, upsetting the Bull-
dogs. And the jawing continued
after the second-period buzzer
sounded. The teams met around
center ice, and the action started.

Sophomore defenseman Chad
Langlais was checked from behind
by Bulldog forward Mike Embach
and senior forward Travis Turnbull
looked to retaliate. He went over to
the Ferris State bench where the
pair started trash talking each other
and other. Both Miller and Turnbull
received game misconducts.
"Turnbull and Miller got to rest
in the third period," Berenson said
jokingly. "You notice how during
the (senior) introductions, Miller
goes straight to the penalty box and
shakes hands with the penalty box
keepers because he knows them
better than anybody else."
GLENDENING'S TOP-LINE PRO-
MOTION: Freshman Luke Glenden-
ingwasn't expected to be the biggest
contributor in this year's freshman
class. But his last few weeks of play
earned him a spot in the top line Sat-
urday after fellow freshman David
Wohlberg was scratched.
Glendening scored two goals in
Michigan's comeback 4-2 win over
Nebraska-Omaha on Feb. 14 and
has tallied five goals since January.
"Luke can play with anyone,"
Berenson said. "I think he's a good,
solid player and adds something
with anyone he plays with. He just
works hard. You watch him coming
back, his second effort is defensive.
He just plays strong."

BURSTING THE BUBBLE
Michigan men's basketball fans have been obsessing over the
proverbial NCAA Tournament Bubble to see where the Wolverines
stand. To make it easier on you, here's a list of must-see games:
KANSAS STATE ATOKLAHOMA
STATE, TUESDAY AT 7:30 P.M.
Root for: Oklahoma State
Both of these teams were fea-
tured on this week's "Bubble
Watch" on ESPN, so Michigan
fans should watch. this gameF
with a very vested interest. The
Wildcats appear to be on the out-
side looking in, with a terrible
strength of schedule (98) and
subpar RPI (73), but another win
would certainly help. Since the
Cowboys are probably already in
the tournament, the Wolverine
faithful will want to see them 7RLiN WAGNtR/
bury Kansas State on Tuesday. JuniorDenis Clemente, a Puerto Rico native, is averaging over 15 points per game.
NO.10 WAKE FOREST AT MARYLAND, TUESDAY AT 9 P.M.
Root for: Wake Forest
On Feb. 21, Maryland guard Greivis Vasquez had the game of his life. Against then-No. 3 North Carolina
Vasquez had the first Terrapin triple-double since 1987 while scoring a career-high 35 points. His effort was
just enough to topple the Tar Heels in overtime and start some serious NCAA Tournament buzz for the Ter-
rapins. Right now, Maryland is right on the bubble, but beating No. 10 Wake Forest tonight would almost
certainly getcthem in. This is Maryland's last shot at a big win before the ACC Tournament, so Michigan needs
Wake Forest to win.
NO. 2 NORTH CAROLINA AT
VIRGINIA TECH, WEDNESDAY
AT 7:00 P.M.
Root for: North Carolina
All season, the Hokies have not
quite been good enough to reach
"elite" status. They have seven
losses of four points or less. Like
Michigan, Virginia Tech has been
on the bubble as of late, and it
definitely needs one more quality
win to make the NCAA Tourna-
ment. North Carolina can keep
the Hokies out of the tournament,
and you'd be fool to say the Tar
Heels aren't a lock for the Big
DON PETESEN/AP Dance. Suck it up and root for the
Sophomore Terrell Bell and the Hokies can turn some heads with a win this week. top dog.
WISCONSIN AT MINNESOTA, WEDNESDAY AT 8:30 P.M.
Root for: Wisconsin
One month ago, after six straight Badger losses, this game would have mant much more to Wisconsin than
Minnesota. But after the Badgers reeled off five straight wins in February, including victories against Illi-
nois, Penn State and Ohio State, Wisconsin is sitting pretty leading up to the NCAA Tournament. The Golden
Gophers have lost five of their last seven and need to win one of its last two games to finish .500 in conference
play. The Wolverines want Wisconsin to win because they need to finish above Minnesota in the Big Ten stand-
ings.
PROVIDENCE AT NO.16 VILLANOVA, THURSDAY AT 7:00 P.M.
Root for: Villanova
Providence's tournament hopes looked pretty bleak after losses to Louisville and Ntre Dame. But last
week, the Friars catapulted their way back onto the bubble with their 81-73 upset over then-No. 1 Pittsburgh.
It was the quality conference win Providence had been struggling to get all season. The Friars have one more
shot Thursday night in their regular-season finale. If they beat Villanova on the road, they are probably in.
Michigan wants a Wildcat win. That would put pressure on Providence to pull off some upsets in the BiguEast
Tournament in order to earna tournament spot.
NO. 23 ILLINOIS AT PENN
STATE, THURSDAY AT 9:00
P.M.
Root for: Illinois
Why are you hearing about
Penn State? he Nittany Lions are

tied for fourth place in the Big Ten
and 1.5 games ahead of Michigan.
You'd think Penn State is a lock,
but its lousy strength of sched-
ule rating can hold it back from
an at-large bid. Penn State has
wins against Purdue and Michi-
gan State boost its tournament
resum, but not much else helps.
If the Nittany Lions win, they
will distance themselves from

that to happen.
CALIFORNIA AT ARIZONA, THURSDAY AT 10:30 P.M.
Root for: California
Both Arizona and California failed to cash in on what would have been quality resum6-building wins Sat-
urday. The Wildcats let a halftime lead slip away at then-No. 21 Washington and California held a lead heading
into the final 10 minutes before falling to then-19 UCLA. Both losses gave Michigan a boost on the bubble.
But on Thursday night, the Wolverines want Laval Lucas-Ferry's former teammates at Arizona to lose. The
Golden Bears are in a pretty solid position and will probably make the tournament. The Wildcats chances are
more shaky, and a loss Thursday would be their fourth in a row
KENTUCKY AT FLORIDA,
SATURDAY AT 2 P.M.
Root for: Florida
This is potentially a lose-lose
situation for the Wolverines. r
Both the Gators and the Wild-
cats are on the fringes of the
bubble, and a 'W' will benefit
either team. But Florida is a little
closer to clinching a spot in the
Big Dance. Kentucky (66th in
the RPI) would gain more from
a win in this game, so Michigan
fans should be rooting for the
Gators on Saturday.

Junior Jodie Meeks dropped 54 points in a single game earlier this year.

Former Wolverines shine in NFL audition

Despite initially low
expectations, Trent,
Jamison and Taylor
strong at Combine
By TIM ROHAN
Daily Sports Writer
INDIANAPOLIS -
The Michigan football team
and San Jose State had an
equal number of invitees
at this year's NFL Combine.
In years past, Wolverines could
impress NFL scouts by school
and name recognition alone. But
this year, they had to stand out
by working hard at their NFL job
interview.
The NFL Combine took place
February 18-24 at the Indianapo-
lis Colts' Lucas Oil Stadium. The
players who are deemed the most
likely to be drafted are invited to
the event each year.
After finishing the 2008 season
with a 3-9 record, Michigan sent
just four seniors to the combine:
defensive tackle Terrence Taylor,
cornerback Morgan Trent, defen-
sive end Tim Jamison and long
snapper Sean Griffin.
Despite the small number of
athletes, the maize-and-blue con-
tingent certainly made its pres-
ence known.
THEIR STRENGTHS AND
WEAKNESSES
Taylor, Michigan's run-stuffing
defensive tackle, saw his produc-
tion fall in his senior season. Jami-
son is caught between being too
small to play defensive end in a 4-3
NFL defense and not being athlet-
ic enough to play the outside line-
backer position in a 3-4, according
to analysts. Trent's ability to cover
and his tackling were both ques-
tioned. And, well, Griffin is just a
long snapper.
NFL Network draft analyst
Mike Mayock said the Wolver-
ines' tough season, especially on
defense, could hurt any prospect's
stock. But that just gave Taylor
and Jamison motivation to prove
the critics wrong.
"I want to show my power, my
explosiveness and my strength,"
Taylor said Saturday before he

worked out. "One of the things
I wanted to show as a defensive
tackle (is) how I can get up the
field fast ... how fast I can cut and
get up field. Those are key things
for an interior defensive lineman."
Taylor, weighing in at six feet
and 300-plus pounds, said his
decrease in production had alot to
do with his position change. As a
junior, Taylor played on the strong
side of the defense. He faced a lot
of running plays, and as a result,
tallied a high number of tackles.
He moved to the weak side his
senior season.
On the other hand, Jamison
wanted to simply do well in the
defensive line drills. Along with
that, he tried to improve his over-
all consistency and patience.
Experts weigh in on Michigan
before workouts
Mayock and ESPN draft expert
ToddMcShayweren'tveryimpressed
by any of the Wolverines before they
worked out at the Combine.
"(Taylor is) quicker for a wide-
body defensive tackle," McShay
said. "And when he plays 100 per-
cent, when he gives a great effort
and when he's fresh, he can be dis-
ruptive. He's inconsistent. ... A lot
of his weaknesses are coachable,
but there are so many busts at that
position because of just that - the
inconsistent motor."
McShay saw Taylor as more of
a 4-3 traditional defensive tackle
and he didn't think Taylor's "style"
would be conducive to taking on
blockers in the 3-4. Mayock saw
Taylor's role as completely differ-
ent and pegged him as a 3-4 defen-
sive tackle.
The experts also had questions
about Jamison.
"(Jamison's) a little bit of a tween-
er between defensive tackle and
defensive end," Mayock said. "And
he's going to have to show somebody
he can play on the outside."
Added McShay: "I think he's
better suited at D-end, probably in
a 4-3.... (He's) toughversus the run,
he's going to do a good job. He's
kind of the opposite of Taylor. He
plays hard every down, (he's) dis-
ciplined, does all the little things.
But he's limited athletically. Not a
great speed rusher."
McShay also said that, while
he was watching tape, he noticed
juniorBrandon Graham reallystood

He had the best time for his posi-
tion in the 60-yard shuttle, com-
pleting the drill in 11.07 seconds.
Trent was also in the top 10 for
the bench press, the vertical jump,
the broad jump and the 20-yard
shuttle. He ran the 40-yard dash
in 4.54 seconds.
Jamison didn't finish as a top
performer in any category. His
draft stock might have been hurt
when he ran the forty-yard dash
in 5.03 seconds. Considering he
checked in at 6-foot-2 and a light
256 pounds, his 40-yard dash time
was expected to be faster.
CARR, RODRIGUEZ AND THE
IMPACT OF THE SPREAD
OFFENSE
When Lloyd Carr stepped
down as Michigan football coach
before last season, Rich Rodriguez
brought his spread offense to Ann
Arbor. That'transition is already
affecting the crop of Wolverines
heading for the NFL.
Jamison downplayed the tran-
sition, citing the fact that the
defense still played a 4-3 forma-
tion. Both Jamison and McShay
said they believe Rodriguez could
turn around the program.
Taylor was a little bit more can-
did about the coaching change.
"It affects us in so many ways,"
Taylor said. "With Coach Carr,
you're familiar with him. You
know what to expect. It makes
everything so much easier. You're
not stressed about things and
(have) less to think about. All you
are worrying about is performing
on the field and school.
"New coach comes in your
senior year. This is your last year.
... You've got to practice a differ-
ent way. So much new, (thrown) on
you in your last year and you've got
to pick it up so fast."
A popular topic at the NFL Com-
bine was the increasing amount of
schools in the NCAA playing the
spread offense. Many coaches and
front-office officials weighed in on
how the NFL would have to adjust
to evaluating the talent developed
in the new style of offense.
"It's a transition," McShay
said. "I think the NFL's adjusting
because it has to. The NFL's devel-
opmental league is college football.
... Tweaking some schemes to get
guys in comfort zones, especially

playing early in their career - it's a
necessity. And it doesn't translate
completely.
"You're not going to see guys
running the zone read and all that
stuff because of the speed."
McShay cited last year's AFC
Championship between Baltimore
and Pittsburgh as an example.
"(The Baltimore Ravens) ran
the inside handoff off the shot-
gun a couple times in the first
half," McShay said. "Second half,
(Ravens' quarterback Joe Flacco)
plucks it, and turns the corner,
looks like he's going for 10, 15
yards. (Steelers safety Troy) Pola-
malu shoots out of a rocket and
takes him for a three-yard loss.
That's why you can't run those
things consistently in the NFL."
McShay also talked about how
wide receivers won't have as much
space to work with as they do in
the spread offense. He also said
the lack of high grades for quar-
terbacks who played in a spread
offense formation shows that most
spread players struggle with the
transition to the NFL. In the pros,
receivers are pressed and forced
to read routes - things that don't
happen when a receiver plays in
the spread offense.
But some things about Michigan
will never change - particularly
the intangibles.
"Everything about Michigan
is professional," Taylor said. "We
don't take shortcuts. We don't
need to cheat our way. We put up
hard work. We play in front of the
most people in the world. Michi-
gan is always in the spotlight.
"You've already been through
it. You've already been inside the
fans that love their football teams.
You've been a part of dealing with
the media every day. You play the
top level at Michigan. So it's an
easy transition (to the NFL)."
The Michigan players tried to
impress NFL scouts and execu-
tives at the NFL Combine and the
Wolverines' draft futures are not
largely out of their hands. But it
is up to the players whether they
excel at the next level.
The advice Carr used to give
Taylor and the rest of the Wolver-
ines reigns true now, more than
ever: "control the controllables."
Presumably, the rest will now take
care of itself.

out and that the talent level between
him and Jamison was "noticeably
different." Graham decided to stay
in Ann Arbor next season.
Trent received the highest
praise of the Wolverine group.
"Trent's a long, lean corner,"
Mayock said. "He's going to run
well. He's a smart kid. He's not
real physical. But he can play in
the league for a while."
COMBINE RESULTS
Thought of as mid-to-late round
selections, the four Michigan

players turned some heads when
the defensive linemen worked out
Monday and defensive backs had
their turn Tuesday.
Taylor took charge by leading all
defensive linemen at the combine
with 37 reps at 225 pounds on the
bench press. He was second among
all players, behind just Texas Tech
offensive lineman Louis Vasquez,
who had 39 reps. Taylor ran the
40-yard dash in 5.27 seconds.
But Trent was the real star for
Michigan, finishing among the top
10 for cornerbacks in five events.
