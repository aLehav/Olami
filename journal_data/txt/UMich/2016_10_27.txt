Black student enrollment at the 

University of Michigan decreased 
in this year’s freshman class of 
2020, according to enrollment 
figures released by the University 
Wednesday morning.

The new class of students is 

overall more diverse than last 
year’s class, however.

Enrollment of Black freshmen 

fell from 5.1 percent in 2015 
to 4.6 percent this year. 13.8 
percent of the class comes from 
underrepresented 
minority 

backgrounds 
— 
a 
category 

including 
Black, 
Hawaiian, 

Hispanic, Native American, or 
a combination of two or more 

ethnicities — marking an increase 
of 1 percent from last year in 
overall diversity.

Hispanic enrollment rose by 

.82 percent in the new class, the 
largest increase among any group 
of underrepresented minorities.

In an interview with the 

Daily in September, University 
President 
Mark 
Schlissel 

said the growth in racial and 
socioeconomic 
diversity 
was 

more drastic last year due to 
newly introduced strategies.

“There won’t be as big a leap 

this year as there was last year,” 
he said. “It’s the kind of thing 
that will continue to bounce up 
and down year by year, but it’s 
important the overall trajectory is 
upward.”

Nobel Peace Laureate Shirin 

Ebadi received a standing ovation 
from more than 300 students and 
faculty for her lecture on gender 
and sexuality in Islamic cultures 
Wednesday.

The Rackham Amphitheatre 

was packed for the Digital 
Islamic 
Studies 
Curriculum 

Distinguished lecture, “Gender 
and Sexuality in Islamic Culture,” 
which was co-hosted by the 
Weiser Center for Emerging 
Democracies and the University 
of Michigan Law School.

Ebadi was awarded the Nobel 

Peace Prize in 2003 for her work 
as a lawyer in Iran, representing 
women, 
religious 
minorities 

and other marginalized voices. 
Speaking in Farsi through an 
interpreter 
in 
her 
remarks 

Wednesday, she discussed the 
political repression of women 
in Islamic countries, citing her 
experience as an attorney and as 
a Muslim.

She 
told 
the 
crowd 
she 

appreciated 
the 
opportunity 

to lecture on Islam and the 
patriarchy in the Middle East 
because she felt much of the fear 
surrounding 
Islamic 
culture 

stemmed 
from 
the 
lack 
of 

knowledge about the region.

“If people in a society want to 

live in peace together, there is no 
other choice but understanding 
and appreciating other’s cultures,” 
she said.

Contextualizing 
laws 

with historical and religious 
information, she touched on 
the background of a variety of 
oppressive laws in the Middle 
East, such as the death penalty as 
a punishment for homosexuality 
and the laws of inheritance that 
are limited for women.

Overall, she said she felt 

providing 
information 
helped 

combat growing Islamophobia in 
society.

“We have to put an end 

to the flame before it takes 
over, because then we will 
have destruction that cannot 
be fixed,” she said. “Let’s be 
forgiving like the sky, let’s 
grow the seed of cooperation 
like the earth, spread the 
friendship like the wind, be 
like fire burning ignorance 
and prejudice, be kind to each 
other.”

Ebadi 
also 
provided 
an 

interpretation of the Quran that 

she said permitted the change 
of unjust and patriarchal laws.

“Societies change, and things 

change in society, so according 
to the change in society, the 
time and the condition, these 
laws must change,” she said.

Following the lecture, a Q&A 

session was hosted, in which 
audience members asked Ebadi 
questions about her experience 
and her ideas for positive 

Wednesday morning, actor 

Wil Wheaton discussed mental 
illness and the importance of 
state and local level races with 
fans at an Ann Arbor comic 
book store event, affectionately 
referred to as a “Nerds for 
Hillary” 
by 
some 
crowd 

members.

Wheaton came to the Vault 

of Midnight comic book store, 
which 
drew 
approximately 

100 people, to campaign for 
Democratic 
presidential 

nominee Hillary Clinton.

The actor — who is known for 

his roles in “Star Trek,” “Stand 
By Me” and his recurring spot 
in “The Big Bang Theory” — 
said he’s fond he appeals to this 
sort of audience, noting it is 
often forgotten.

“Everybody has that group 

of people that tends to listen 
to them, and we are in a comic 
book shop,” he said. “We are 
a demographic that I think is 
missed a little. People tend to 
treat us as just nerds who don’t 
matter.”

Engineering junior Dong Yi Chen at the Engineering Student Government Meeting in the Michigan Union Wednesday.

At their Wednesday meeting, 

Engineering Student Government 
discussed plans to host a review of 
the University’s Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion plan, separate from 
the forums hosted by the College of 

Engineering, because of sentiments 
from 
students 
that 
they 
felt 

uncomfortable and unable to speak 
freely at University hosted events.

The planned review is slated 

to be held Thursday at 7 p.m. in 
Chesbrough Auditorium.

The DEI strategic plan is a 

University-wide 
initiative 
that 

aims to create a more diverse and 

inclusive 
campus 
atmosphere. 

It was launched by University 
President Mark Schlissel early this 
October. Under the umbrella of the 
overall plan, individual colleges are 
charged with organizing specific 
initiatives to increase diversity 
among their student populations.

The College of Engineering 

hosted several forums on the 

diversity plan this semester, but 
ESG President Rebekah Andrews, 
an Engineering senior, said she 
thought student-led forums may 
draw 
more 
underrepresented 

students to what she referred to as 
a more neutral space, saying the 
college’s events failed to facilitate 
an open environment.

The Michigan Daily — michigandaily.com

The University of Michigan 

announcedTuesday that the 

academic platform CTools — which 

was launched in 2004 — will be 

entirely phased out by the end of 2017.

According to the press release, 

CTools users, both faculty and 

students, will be able to set up 

CTools project sites to be used for 

research, information storage, 

and collaborative purposes with 

the permission of the office for 

Information and Technology 

Services from December to 

February, whereupon the ability to 

create new pages will be entirely 

disabled. However, all classes are 

not permitted to use CTools as their 

educational platform.

Already the process of switching 

from CTools to Canvas — which 

was piloted by all academic units at 

the University during the 2014-2015 

academic year — began September 

2014. Starting this year, all courses at 

the University were required to use 

Canvas over CTools.

Currently, CTools is being used 

for the creation and maintenance of 

project sites, according to the press 

release, which noted that about 

60,000 sites remain online. However, 

fewer than 6,000 were active during 

the last year.

This shift, according to Sean 

DeMonner, the executive director 

of ITS Teaching and Learning, is 

potentially a result of the convenience 

of other, more modern technologies.

 “Use of CTools Project Sites 

continues to decline — likely the 

result of several newer collaboration 

tools being available to campus.” 

DeMonner said. “Most people find 

that tools like U-M Google and U-M 

Box better meet their needs.”

 Throughout the University-wide 

shift to Canvas, there will be systems 

in place, such as the Migrations 

Champions program, to assist 

faculty and student site owners in 

transferring data from CTools to the 

new platform.

During the spring and fall of 2017, 

ITS is scheduled to transfer project 

site data from CTools to Box — which 

is a cloud-based data storage system 

that is available to all University 

faculty, staff and students. Any site 

manager will have the option to 

personally download their site data, 

or have their site deleted.

Site managers will also be 

presented with the option of having 

their CTools site data transferred 

to Canvas, where it will safe from 

deletion and can be accessed past the 

CTools elimination date.

DeMonner noted that transition 

to Canvas has already shown 

promise, and that the willingness 

of the faculty and students across 

the University to embrace the new 

platform will likely ensure a smooth 

phase-out for CTools.

“Any large-scale change requires 

support from many individuals 

across our campus,” DeMonner 

said. “Canvas was a success due in 

large part to our partnerships with 

individuals in each school and college. 

We plan to use a similar model as we 

move project sites to other solutions.”

For 
Ashley 
Gearhardt, 

University of Michigan assistant 
professor of Psychology and 
winner 
of 
the 
prestigious 

2017 Henry Russel Award, her 
research on food addiction 
and eating disorders is deeply 
connected with the way humans 
interact with one another.

Gearhardt 
has 
a 
long 

history of involvement with 
the 
University 
Psychology 

Department, 
starting 
with 

her time as an undergraduate 
student majoring in psychology, 
and 
continuing 
when 
she 

entered the role of researcher 
and teacher at the University.

While pursuing her Ph.D. 

at Yale University in clinical 
psychology, 
Gearhardt 

researched alcohol use at Yale’s 

psychology 
laboratory. 
She 

decided to study food addiction 
using 
a 
similar 
technique, 

leading 
her 
to 
create The 

Food and Addiction Science 
Treatment Lab. The FASTLab 
includes a real-life fast food 
restaurant 
simulation 
that 

was inspired by Gearhardt’s 
doctoral research.

“Investigating what factors 

contributed 
to 
excessive 

drinking 
in 
a 
cue-rich, 

naturalistic 
environment 

allowed us to do much more 
real world research,” Gearhardt 
said. “I wanted to do the same 
thing with food, so we built the 
fast food restaurant.”

About 71 percent of 20+ 

year olds in the United States 
were overweight or obese in 
2014 according to the CDC, a 
chronic illness which could lead 
to death. Gearhardt said she 
believes national obesity must 

be addressed through gathering 
research about the nature of 
food addiction.

Food 
addiction 
and 

obesity are issues that have 
direct influences on college 
students. College students are 
a population at risk for weight 
gain, 
according 
to 
studies 

conducted 
by 
the 
National 

Institute of Health that found 
college 
freshmen 
are 
more 

likely to gain weight during 
their freshman year than the 
general population.

The purpose of her data 

analysis is to better understand 
how 
factors 
in 
the 
food 

environment, 
such 
as 
food 

product placements and food 
commercials, can encourage the 
onset of food addiction.

“The rates of obesity are 

going up all over the world and 
this is accompanied by changes 
in our food environment where 
foods high in fat, sugar and salt 
are now easily accessible, cheap, 
and heavily advertised,” she 
said.

FASTLab 
itself 
analyzes 

the effects of food addiction 
through various neurological 
and behavioral measures, such 
as brain imaging or observations 
from the field. Gearhardt said 
after she and her team visited 
and observed a number of fast 
food restaurants in the area, 
she developed a prototype for 
a typical fast food restaurant, 
including the color, menus, 
lighting and other aspects of 
those locations.

She also noted that media may 

impact the prevalence of obesity 
and 
fast 
food 
consumption 

among 
undergraduates, 

making research on marketing 
important, 
especially 
for 

college-aged 
students 
who 

are especially vulnerable to 
the messages conveyed on TV 
advertisements and in other 
forms of media.

University spokesperson Rick 

Fitzgerald said in an interview 
Wednesday 
administrators 
are 

focusing their efforts on improving 
diversity of all types, including 
racial and economic, as well as on 
admitting first-generation students 
and students from a wider variety 
of high schools. He acknowledged, 
however, that efforts to increase 
African-American 
enrollment 

fell short of the University’s 
expectations.

“It’s a difficult process of trying 

to focus on improve diversity at the 
University,” Fitzgerald said. “But 
it’s an area that we continue to 
work on, within the law of the state 
of Michigan.”

As a whole, the undergraduate 

enrollment of minority students 
increased 
from 
11.4 
percent 

last fall to 12.3 percent of the 
undergraduate student body. In 
2005, the year before Michigan 
voters passed Proposal 2 —a 
measure 
effectively 
banning 

affirmative action in admissions 
processes — minority enrollment 
accounted for 13.7 percent of the 
student body, according to a report 
issued by the University.

Fitzgerald highlighted efforts 

aimed at bringing low-income 
students 
to 
the 
University 

including the HAIL scholarship, 
which guarantees four years of 
waived tuition and fees for eligible 
students. The first cohort from the 
program enrolled in this year’s 
freshman class.

“The first year of our HAIL 

scholarship experiment was very 
successful.” Fitzgerald said. “We 
brought in 262 HAIL scholars 
from all around Michigan. Now 
this 
effort 
primarily 
targets 

socioeconomic diversity because 
that’s what the state law allows us 
to do.”

Schlissel said in an October 

interview with the Daily, however, 
many of the DEI’s measures, 
including the HAIL program 
and other efforts focused on 
recruitment 
and 
enrollment, 

depend on funds that have yet to be 
raised.

“Our hope is a significant portion 

of the $85 million (in DEI funds) 
will come from philanthropy,” he 
said.

This year’s freshman class of 

6,689 students is a significant 
increase from last year, when the 
University enrolled 6,071 incoming 
freshman.

Fitzgerald said this 618-student 

increase in the freshman class was 
part of a yearlong intentional effort 
by the University to expand the size 
of the student body.

Overall enrollment for the Ann 

Arbor campus rose 2.4 percent 
from last year, bringing the total 
number of undergraduate students 
to 28,983 and graduate students to 
15,735. 

Out-of-state 
students 
now 

comprise 48.4 percent of the 
student body, as compared to 46.5 
percent in 2015. In-state enrollment 
dropped by 254 students, now 
making up 51.6 percent of all 
students.

In a Wednesday press release, 

the director of undergraduate 
admissions, Erica Sanders, said 

that the admissions department 
reviewed 55,504 applications — an 
increase of around 7 percent from 
last year. 

Of 
the 
55,504 
applications 

received, the University offered 
15,871 students admission. In total, 
6,689 students enrolled with a yield 
of 42.1 percent.

The number of first-generation 

students also spiked by 8.5 percent, 
and the number of Pell Grant 
recipients increased to 17 percent 
of freshman, up from 15.3 percent 
last year.

In September, Schlissel said 

administrators 
prioritized 

improving financial accessibility, 
even as tuition costs increased by 
3.9 percent for in-state residents 
and 4.4 percent for out-of-state 
students.

“What we do always in balance 

tuition increases with an increase 
in financial aid,” he said. “That’s 
the way we keep working at 
diversifying the student body.”

The University press release 

report financial aid rose overall by 
10.8 percent this year, allotting $170 
million for need-based financial 
aid. Many such measures are 
included in the University’s new 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
strategic plan released earlier 
this month. Though out-of-state 
students are offered less financial 
aid, Schlissel said new admissions 
still contribute to overall diversity.

We’ve grown a little bit in 

the non-Michigan students ... to 
diversify the student body,” he said. 
“We’re looking at students of all 
socioeconomic statuses around the 
country.”

the venue, said the campaign 
had reached out to him about 
hosting Wheaton, adding he 
was enthusiastic about the 
event as a fan of Wheaton and a 
supporter of Clinton.

“The stakes are huge for 

this election, and we want to 
be involved in any way that we 
can,” he said.

For a large portion of his 

remarks, Wheaton focused on 
mental health policy, an issue he 
said has personal significance 
for him as someone who has 
suffered from severe depression 
and anxiety for most of his life. 
He emphasized that mental 
illness should be treated with 
the same level of seriousness as 
any other health issue.

“There’s a lot of people 

that 
I’ve 
encountered 
who 

think that if I was just a little 
stronger, just worked a little 
harder, just fought a little more 
it would be OK,” he said. “You 
would never tell a person with 
a broken leg to just walk on it 
until it didn’t hurt anymore. 
You wouldn’t tell a person with 
diabetes to just stop having 
diabetes, be tougher. But that’s 
the way we treat mental illness 
in our society.”

Wheaton also encouraged 

the 
audience 
to 
vote 
for 

Democrats down the ballot 
during the event, emphasizing 

the 
importance 
of 
lower-

level elections along with the 
presidential election.

“The road to the White 

House starts at your school 
board level,” he said. “The way 
that you shape your counties 
and you shape your states is 
through the local elections. 
We have to plant the seeds 
for Democratic voters in the 
future.”

The most recent Michigan 

Daily 
election 
poll 
of 
a 

sample of students showed 
steady support for Clinton on 
campus, 
with 
70.3 
percent 

of respondents favoring the 
democratic nominee.

Michigan as a whole has 

leaned toward Clinton for the 
past several polling cycles and 
is not considered a swing state, 
though Trump and Clinton were 
previously close in Michigan’s 
polling numbers. The most 
recent RealClearPolitics polling 
average showed Clinton leading 
Republican nominee Donald 
Trump by 10 points.

Nonetheless, 
Wheaton 

stressed the importance of 
encouraging people to vote 
for Clinton come Election Day 
because of the contrast he sees 
between the two candidates.

“You just turn on the TV, 

and you see this despicable 
and 
disgusting 
man 
being 

awful to women and awful to 
immigrants and being awful 
to basically everyone who is 
not him,” he said. “Then we 

have this amazing woman who 
has literally spent her entire 
career fighting for women and 
children. That’s why we have 
got to get out and we have got 
to cast our votes for Hillary 
Clinton and Tim Kaine.”

Engineering 
junior 

Austin Dumm who said he 
is a supporter of Clinton and 
Wheaton, echoed Wheaton’s 
sentiments on getting out the 
vote.

“I’m a big fan of Wil Wheaton 

and a big fan of the Clinton 
campaign,” he said. “I think he’s 
entirely accurate in everything 
he’s saying. If we get out there, 
we are going to win this. I think 
it speaks to the community of 
Ann Arbor that he is here and 
that we have this much support 
for him.”

Ann Arbor resident Gregg 

Briggs also said he enjoyed 
Wheaton’s 
remarks 
on 
the 

importance of voting in local 
and state elections, saying he 
hopes it will aid in creating a 
more bipartisan legislature.

“I really appreciated his 

ability to speak about the real 
issues out there,” he said. 
“And all of the other effects 
that go beyond the individual 
Trump or Clinton, but down 
ticket races and how it is going 
to spread out and hopefully 
bring back our democracy into 
something that is going to work 
across differences instead of 
just screaming at each other.”

president of CSG, Charlton 
also served as president of 
the Student Athletic Advisory 
Committee.

Regent 
Mark 
Bernstein 

(D), who presented Charlton 
with the award, emphasized 
Charlton’s focus on inclusion 
and access during his time as 
CSG president.

“The 
agenda 
(Charlton) 

presented every month as CSG 
President was about inclusion, 
about access, and frankly, just 
making our campus a more 
just, fair, and compassionate 
place 
for 
our 
students,” 

Bernstein said. “(Charlton) did 
this as a person that brought 
great humility and grace to 
that work, and I’m grateful to 
him.”

In remarks at the event, 

Charlton said efforts to engage 
in 
sincere 
dialogue 
about 

disability are the first step 
toward inclusion.

“This willingness leads to 

openness, and this openness 
leads to a connection which 
transcends 
differences,” 
he 

said.

Wednesday’s ceremony was 

also part of the 26th Investing 
in 
Ability 
celebration 
on 

campus, an annual month of 
events increasing awareness 
of 
disability 
issues 
and 

recognizing the contributions 
of individuals with disabilities 
to the University and the 
community. As part of the 
recently launched Diversity, 
Equity & Inclusion Plan, this 
year’s 
Investing 
in 
Ability 

month 
featured 
discussions 

on 
how 
diversity 
includes 

disability.

Law School lecturer Jack 

Bernard, chair of the Council 
for Disability Concerns, who 
spoke at the event, said this 
focus was consistent with the 
overall concept of diversity.

“Diversity is not just one 

spectrum, but includes all the 
ways of knowing and being 
and … this is what gives us the 
strength to be the best we can 
be at the University,” Bernard 
said.

Other speakers focused on 

the significant progress at 
the University in providing 
resources 
and 
access 
for 

individuals with disabilities, as 
well as current opportunities 
and challenges in addressing 
the issue on campus.

Stuart Segal, director of 

the Office of Services for 
Students 
with 
Disabilities 

who was in attendance at the 

ceremony, 
highlighted 
the 

lack of awareness regarding 
disability on campus in an 
interview with the Michigan 
Daily, saying that 94 percent 
of students registered at the 
office have “invisible” or non-
apparent disabilities that are 
often overlooked, like mental 
health 
conditions, 
learning 

disabilities, ADHD or having 
an Autism Spectrum Disorder.

“The 
importance 
of 

Investing 
in 
Ability 
and 

this event is exposing the 
University community to the 
breadth of disability issues 
and how prevalent disabilities 
are not only on campus, but in 
our wider community and our 
country.”

Other 
award 
recipients 

were 
recognized 
for 
work 

in a variety of fields, from 
advocating for increased focus 
on disability in medical school 
curriculum to establishing the 
Archive of Data on Disability 
to Enable Policy and Research 
at 
the 
Inter-university 

Consortium for Political and 
Social Research.

Jai Holt, colleague of award 

recipient 
Alison 
Stroud, 
a 

research technician lead at 
ICPSR, said investing in ability 
in all aspects of the University 
makes the community stronger 
and serves as a model for other 
campuses.

“I want to see University 

of Michigan be a diverse 
community that has input from 
a variety of members. That will 
fortify us to be stronger,” Holt 
said.

Griffin Luce has been around 

the highest levels of hockey for 
most of his life. His grandfather 
played with Michigan coach Red 
Berenson in the NHL, and Luce 
himself spent the last two years 
playing on the United States 
National 
Team 
Development 

Program’s Under-17 and Under-18 
teams, considered to be the most 
elite collection of hockey talent in 
the country for those age groups.

But this year, Luce — a freshman 

defenseman under Berenson at 
Michigan — has found himself in 
a bit of an adjustment period with 
the Wolverines.

“Obviously getting used to 

the pace of play in college at 
the beginning of the year — it 
wasn’t a challenge, but it took 
some time,” Luce said. “But now 
that I found the role that I know 
that I need to play, I think I just 
(need to) continue to do that in 
practice every day and get as much 
feedback from the coaches as 
possible.”

That role, as described by Luce, 

is a “shutdown guy.” He goes onto 
the ice with a goal of neutralizing 
the other team’s best players with 
his size and physicality.

So far, Luce has filled that role 

rather nicely. He has proven his 
physical ability with multiple 
bone-crushing hits throughout 
the young season. But he has fallen 
victim to a few penalties when 
that physicality went too far, and 
that’s something that he’ll have to 
improve on in the future.

“There’s definitely a fine line,” 

said senior defenseman Nolan 
De Jong. “I think he’s the kind 
of guy we want to tread that line. 
You don’t necessarily have to have 
the last word, because we play 
hard between the whistles, and 
that’s something that Coach really 
stresses to us. But he’s the kind of 
guy that guys should be scared to 
go in the corners with.”

Added Luce: “I call it focused 

intensity 
and 
controlled 

aggression — having controlled 
aggression as opposed to just 
being reckless out there and taking 
penalties. Picking your spots is 
big, too. If the team needs a big 
hit or something, not going out 
and trying to headhunt guys, but 

let the play come to you and take 
advantage of that opportunity 
when it presents itself.”

The main area where Luce has 

yet to come into his own is on 
the offensive end. In fact, when 
he isn’t laying opponents out 
on the ice, Luce may not leave a 
huge impression at all. But for 
defensemen, that isn’t necessarily 
a bad thing.

“Defensemen are judged on 

their mistakes,” Berenson said. 
“Forwards always get judged on 
their good plays, so it’s just about 
unfair for defensemen. But Griffin 
is a player who, when you don’t 
notice him in a game, that’s when 
he’s playing his best.”

Luce obviously has some work 

to do before he is a top defenseman 
for Michigan. He has taken some 
unadvisable penalties this year 
and has taken part in his fair 
share of shoving matches after the 
whistle.

But so far, his size and 

physicality have paid dividends. 
And if his family and personal 
history are any indication, it’s a 
good bet that the rest of Luce’s 
game will shape into form, and he 
will be fully adjusted soon.

adolescents generally have a 
strong reward drive and the 
cognitive control mechanisms in 
the brain aren’t fully developed 
until you get older,” Gearhardt 
added.

Because 
of 
knowing 
this 

fact, Gearhardt said that food 
companies take advantage of 
youth by aggressively marketing 
to them, which poses harmful 
effects to college students as they 
don’t have parental oversight on 
their food choices.

“During this age period you 

are 
also 
more 
independent 

and you don’t have as much 
parental oversight on what you 
eat,” Gearhardt said. “The food 
companies take advantage of this 
by aggressively marketing to this 
age group and almost all of these 
foods are very rewarding, but 
bad for your health in the long-
term.”

All of this research, Gearhardt 

said the idea that people with 
obesity bring it upon themselves 
through consciously eating fast 
food while knowing of its risks 
is a misunderstanding of the 
broader societal problems in the 
media and in corporations that 
lead to the epidemic.

“The 
dominant 
narrative 

is that it is all just a matter of 
willpower, and while we need to 
all be responsible to try and make 
the best choices for our health, 
the current food environment 
makes it extremely hard to have 
a 
healthy 
relationship 
with 

food,” Gearhardt said.

The issue of fast food is also 

currently a topic of discussion 
on campus beyond Gearhardt’s 
lab: 
The 
Sustainable 
Food 

Systems Initiative held its third 
annual symposium, “Fast Food 
for Thought” Tuesday, where 10 
faculty members from different 
departments delivered a series 
of mini-lectures on food and 
agriculture.

Overall, Gearhardt said she 

hopes 
that 
FASTLab’s 
work 

will change how people view 
substance addiction and that, 
with more time and effort, there 
may be improvements in public 
health nationwide.

“Policy 
approaches 
that 

have worked with substance 
addictions, 
like 
restrictions 

on marketing and taxes, may 
be effective in re-shaping our 
environment to encourage a 
culture of health,” Gearhardt 
said. “I hope that our work 
reduces 
the 
stigma 
that 

individuals who have higher 
BMIs now face.”

“We definitely believe some 

thoughts weren’t captured due 
to that fact,” she said, adding 
that her goal for the meeting will 
be to bring more student-based 
concerns to the table.

In an interview after the 

meeting, she said she hoped 
the forum would engage more 
students about the plan because a 
student-hosted space would create 
a more casual environment. She 
said she’d heard from students that 
having administrators hold events 
made them feel they weren’t able 
to speak freely.

“We’re having the DEI review 

to go over the plan with more 
people so we know who we are 
representing and to capture more 
thoughts,” she said. “We would 
like to capture the thoughts that 
may not have been expressed 
during the administration one due 
to the weird dynamic of a non-
neutral facilitation.”

Student dissatisfaction or lack 

of engagement with University 
events on the plan has been present 
in multiple colleges throughout 
the University, including for the 
College of LSA. At several forums 
hosted by LSA, student attendance 
was noticeably low in comparison 

with the overall size of the 
college’s student body.

As well, during DEI launch 

events and recent protests over 
both a series of anti-Black, anti-
Islam and anti-LGBTQ posters 
discovered on campus and a 
planned debate on the merits of 
the Black Lives Matter movement, 
multiple students also expressed 
criticism about aspects of the plan.

At a protest over the planned 

Black 
Lives 
Matter 
debate 

outside of the Michigan League 
in September, LSA freshman Asia 
Green said she didn’t feel talking 
to administrators was an effective 
way to cause change.

“There are not enough events 

hosted, 
not 
enough 
forums,” 

Green said. “All of the people up 
higher always talk about how 
they want to promote diversity 
and inclusion but nothing is being 
done.”

During Wednesday’s meeting, 

Andrews also said she was 
concerned 
about 
the 
overall 

recognition 
of 
engineering 

students in the DEI plan, saying 
she has voiced her concerns 
with E. Royster Harper, the vice 
president for Student Life, about 
representation 
of 
engineering 

students on campus.

She said because engineering 

is prominently represented in the 
University’s student population, 

they should be included when 
administrative 
decisions 
are 

made regarding dining options 
and activities on North Campus, 
noting that art students and 
freshmen were also affected both 
those decisions.

Other 
ESG 
members, 
like 

Engineering 
junior 
Breanna 

DeCocker, agreed.

“What a lot of people consider 

the University is Central Campus,” 
DeCocker 
said, 
adding 
the 

University can leave out art, music 
and engineering students.

Engineering junior Madhav 

Sharma, an ESG member, said 
the lack of representation could 
be attributed to the amount of 
coursework engineering students 
face, leaving little time for social 
activities, noting many schools 
have this problem.

“I don’t think it’s even possible,” 

Sharma said, referring to a more 
active engineering school.

Engineering 
sophomore 
AJ 

Ashman, an ESG representative, 
noted the recurrence of the anti-
Black, anti-Islam and anti-LGBTQ 
posters on campus, saying he’d 
heard from students who wished 
to see more tangible action than a 
statement of solidarity. He urged 
students to take action when they 
see other students being attacked.

“It’s your problem too — it’s an 

attack on everyone,” he said.

or 
weeks, 
Republican 

presidential 
nominee 

Donald Trump has claimed 

that the election is 
rigged 
against 
him 

and that voter fraud 
will hand Democratic 
presidential 
nominee 

Hillary 
Clinton 
the 

presidency. 
These 

claims 
are 
baseless 

and clearly seek to 
undermine the trust 
that U.S. citizens have 
in their political system. 
But last week, Mr. 
Trump was given an opportunity 
to walk back on his claims. During 
the third presidential debate, 
moderator Chris Wallace, a Fox 
News anchor, asked if Trump 
would be willing to concede the 
results of the election if he were 
to be defeated. His response? “I’ll 
keep you in suspense, OK?”

This is what the foundation 

of American democracy — trust 
in the integrity of our electoral 
system — has been reduced to: 
suspense. A reality show, the 
plaything of a billionaire in over 
his head. The ignorance Trump 
displays through his comments is 
truly astounding for a man seeking 
the highest office in the land, 
given the longstanding history 
of political concessions in our 
country. For a man who claims 
to want to “Make America Great 
Again,” Trump seems to have very 
little knowledge of what it is that 
actually made our country so great 
in the first place.

The nonviolent transfer of 

power from one political party 
to the next has been a staple 
of American democracy since 
Thomas 
Jefferson 
and 
the 

Republicans were elected to take 
control of the government from 
their 
federalist 
counterparts 

in the election of 1800. In a 
seminal moment in the history 
of 
American 
democracy, 
the 

federalists peacefully conceded 
power, signifying that the voice of 
the American people was second 
to none in our great nation. In 
doing so, a powerful precedent 
was set that has stood for over 
200 years now. In America, peace 
and 
democracy 
would 
reign 

supreme over chaos and violence. 
In America, ballots would be more 
powerful than bullets.

Thomas Jefferson heralded this 

peaceful revolution and did his 
best to bridge the divide among the 

American public in his 
first inaugural speech, 
stating, “We are all 
Republicans, we are 
all 
Federalists. 
If 

there be any among 
us who would wish 
to 
dissolve 
this 

Union or to change 
its 
republican 

form, 
let 
them 

stand 
undisturbed 

as 
monuments 
of 

the safety with which error of 
opinion may be tolerated where 
reason is left free to combat it.”

Make no mistake, Trump is 

the embodiment of this error in 
opinion. As Jefferson eloquently 
stated, it is his right as an 
American citizen to preach his 
beliefs, no matter how nonsensical 
some of his claims may be. Yet, 
unfortunately for Trump, there 
is still plenty of reason left in our 
world to combat his falsehoods.

While Trump has created 

a laundry list of questionable 
statements over the past year and 
a half, his claim that the election 
is rigged is ludicrous. Plain and 
simple. In fact, the amount of voter 
fraud in our country is amazingly 
small in comparison to the 
number of ballots cast throughout 
our various election cycles. In 
an op-ed for the Washington 
Post in 2014, Justin Levitt, a 
professor focusing on election 
administration at the Loyola Law 
School in Los Angeles, claimed to 
have found only 31 instances of 
election fraud since the year 2000. 
Keep in mind the massive scope 
of our electoral process as “more 
than 1 billion ballots were cast 
in that period.” While virtually 
no margin of victory could be 
explained by such a small amount 
of voter fraud, recent polls have 
shown Trump trailing by as many 
as 11 points, making his claims 
truly laughable.

Though plenty of things could 

change between now and Nov. 
8, it’s quite obvious that as of 
today, the American people prefer 
Hillary Clinton. Yet, Trump’s 
ego seems to prevent him from 
acknowledging 
this 
possibility. 

Instead, he continues to handle the 
situation with the grace and charm 

of an 11-year-old boy throwing his 
controller at a wall and attempting 
to hit reset on a video game that he is 
losing before it officially concludes. 

Not only is this behavior 

far from presidential, it is flat-
out dangerous. In possibly the 
most contentious election in the 
history of American politics, these 
baseless claims do nothing but 
spread further seeds of division 
throughout our nation. Keeping 
in mind that Trump himself has 
encouraged violence at his rallies 
on numerous occasions, these 
statements create an environment 
in which a violent response in the 
aftermath of the election is a real 
possibility. In fact, Milwaukee 
County Sheriff David Clarke Jr., 
a prominent Trump supporter, 
has 
responded 
to 
Trump’s 

claims of a rigged system by 
insisting that it’s “pitchforks and 
torches time” in America.

Thankfully, 
reason 
has 

prevailed and voices from both 
sides of the aisle have been quick 
to discredit this type of violent 
rhetoric 
and 
the 
validity 
of 

Trump’s claims. As Sen. Lindsey 
Graham (R–S.C.) stated, “Mr. 
Trump is doing the party and 
country a great disservice by 
continuing to suggest the outcome 
of this election is out of his hands 
and ‘rigged’ against him. If he 
loses, it will not be because the 
system is ‘rigged’ but because he 
failed as a candidate.”

Yet no matter how many voices 

of reason emerge in the coming 
weeks, Donald Trump is the 
only man who can put this issue 
to bed. Ironically, it seems that 
the head of the party of Lincoln 
should take notes from the 
man who fell to Honest Abe in 
the election of 1860, Stephen 
Douglas, 
who 
congratulated 

Lincoln after the election when 
he claimed that, “Partisan feeling 
must yield to patriotism. I am 
with you Mr. President, and God 
bless you.” There’s a very good 
chance that Mr. Trump will have 
the opportunity to showcase his 
patriotism on election night. If 
that’s the case, he won’t need to 
make America great. He’ll need 
to keep it great, and concede.

How Trump threatens our democracy

JOE IOVINO | CONTACT JOE AT JIOVINO@UMICH.EDU

The election cycle is too damn long

BRETT GRAHAM | COLUMN

A

pril 
12, 
2015, 
Hillary 

Clinton announced her 
candidacy for president 

of the United States. That was 
one year, six months and 14 days 
ago; 563 days have come and gone 
since then and there are still 13 left 
to go before Election Day. Think 
about how long ago 
that was — 563 days 
ago, the University of 
Michigan’s 
campus 

was focused on the 
controversial showing 
of “American Sniper,” 
“Style” by Taylor Swift 
was at the top of the 
charts, Jon Stewart was 
still behind the desk at 
the Daily Show and the 
world was just meeting 
Caitlyn Jenner. Clinton’s campaign 
was not even the first; Ted Cruz 
launched his almost three weeks 
earlier. So, rather than pile on to the 
mountain of political commentary 
that will dominate social media, 
cable news and late night television 
between now and Nov. 8, I would 
like to take this time to state what 
should 
be 
obvious: 
American 

election cycles are far too long.

Statistically speaking, if you’re 

reading this, you probably know 
who you’re voting for. Some 
estimates place the number of 
undecided 
voters 
somewhere 

between 2 and 12 percent. If, by 
some chance, you are undecided, 
feel free to stop reading this article 
and go read something else that 
will help you make up your mind. 
There are lots out there. Seriously, 
go. For those who stayed: When 
we hear about how polarized this 
election cycle has been, about the 
experience of voter fatigue or 
how a debate performance failed 
to sway anyone from one camp 
to another, it should come as no 
surprise. Eighteen months worth 
of news, primary and general 
debates, conventions and SNL 
impressions have slowly pushed 
Americans to one side or another 
and locked them in place.

All the while, an industry 

worth billions — between ad buys, 
campaign contributions and events 
that have crisscrossed the nation 
— has grown. As a self-diagnosed 
political junkie, this is not the worst 
news for me. Since well before the 
primaries, I have watched nearly 
all of the primary debates, listened 
to the podcasts that recapped 
them and then read the articles 
that previewed the next one. But 

not all Americans are political 
science majors. Most just want this 
election to be over.

Voter fatigue, though, is far from 

the most problematic issue of this 
marathon-esque election cycle. In 
order to run a successful campaign, 
not only does a candidate have to 

decide 
on 
running, 

craft 
their 
message 

(which 
will 
likely 

change with current 
events) 
and 
begin 

developing a strategy 
more than two years 
in advance, but they 
also have to have the 
resources 
to 
keep 

the lights on in their 
campaign office for 
a year and a half. 

They have to pay their campaign 
managers and press secretaries 
and field organizers for a year 
and a half. They have to pay for 
buses and planes to take them 
from Iowa to New Hampshire to 
Florida to Ohio to Nevada.

Simply put, the sheer length 

of the election cycle has put an 
unbelievable price tag on running 
for president. It’s not a problem 
we see in most elections, as 
wealthy donors pull most of the 
weight, and in this election cycle 
both candidates have substantial 
personal wealth. But the question 
remains: What kind of candidates 
have been priced out of running? 
And 
could 
candidates 
like 

Independent presidential nominee 
Evan McMullin or Green Party 
presidential nominee Jill Stein be 
more competitive if they were not 
out-flanked by two organizations 
that have been fundraising and 
growing for over a year and a 
half? Successful campaigns are 
about long-term fundraising and 
organization of volunteers, rallies, 
appearances and policy speeches. 
Both major parties can afford an 
18-month long campaign, but third 
parties and independent campaigns, 
with the exception of Ross Perot, 
a 1992 independent presidential 
candidate and businessman, do not 
have the stamina or funds necessary 
to run that long of a race.

Another issue with this timetable 

is less of a disservice to the American 
voter and more a disservice to 
the man who currently sits in the 
Oval Office. Nearly one quarter 
of Barack Obama’s eight years of 
governing have been overshadowed 
by the circus that is this campaign. 
In column inches, airtime and 

energy spent by both major parties, 
speculation about what will happen 
on Nov. 8 has commandeered what 
little public energy was left for 
the president and the project of 
running the country. Part of the 
reason the election has been able 
to so successfully stifle President 
Obama is that the public has no 
concern for what’s happening on 
Capitol Hill and all the attention 
in the world for Donald Trump’s 
lewd comments or Hillary Clinton’s 
WikiLeaks. The public has been 
convinced that governing takes 
place in the first 100 days of an 
administration, and what remains 
of the president’s four years is spent 
gearing up for the next election.

The New York Times’s Emma 

Roller pointed out that, in the nearly 
600 days it will take to elect the 
45th president of the United States, 
“we could have instead hosted 
approximately 
four 
Mexican 

elections, seven Canadian elections, 
14 British elections, 14 Australian 
elections or 41 French elections.” 
Nearly all of these countries have 
legally defined election cycles. 
They judge their candidates just 
like we do, but they judge them over 
months or weeks rather than years, 
so when it comes time to go to the 
polls, they’re not as disenchanted.

Of course, the American system 

requires candidates to undergo 
intense, long-lasting scrutiny and 
prove their stamina. It provides 
voters every opportunity to educate 
themselves about a candidate and 
allows for each party to carefully 
select its candidate with input from 
all 50 states. It forces candidates to 
prove that they are able to become 
the leader of the free world, both 
physically and mentally. But I have 
a tough time believing that all of 
that could not be accomplished in a 
period of nine months.

In all likelihood, the process 

will be a bit longer next cycle 
than it was this time around, and 
a bit longer the next. Maybe this 
election, in which the two most 
disliked candidates in history are 
running, will prove too exhausting 
to the electorate and there will be a 
change to the status quo. That’s the 
optimist in me talking.

Now to the realist in me: Do a 

quick Google search on “president 
2020” and see how many results 
pop up. It’s already started.

L

ast Saturday, Penn State 
University 
shocked 
the 

college 
football 
world 

with 
an 
improbable 

upset over Ohio State 
University 
in 
State 

College, Pa., the town 
popularly 
known 

as 
Happy 
Valley. 

Despite being 20-point 
underdogs, the Nittany 
Lions 
defeated 
the 

Buckeyes by a score 
of 24-21. To celebrate 
the unexpected — and, 
as many pundits are 
describing it, program-defining — 
win, students and fans took to the 
streets of State College to celebrate. 
However, it didn’t take long for 
celebrations to spiral out of hand.

According 
to 
the 
Daily 

Collegian, Penn State’s student 
newspaper, 
up 
to 
10,000 

people joined the riots, causing 
thousands of dollars in damage 
by 
night’s 
end. 
During 
the 

demonstrations, 
“street 
signs 

were ripped out of the ground 
and tossed in the air by the 
crowd, small fires in the street 
were started, several street lights 
were damaged and one vehicle 
was vandalized.” To disperse the 
crowd, police unleashed pepper 
spray and smoke in a method they 
described as “30 to 45 minutes 
of pain,” as opposed to getting 
“hands-on with the individuals.”

When the dust settled after 

hours of rioting, no one was 
detained overnight. Police did, 
however, visit a fraternity house 
after following a particularly 
raucous rioter, but they left 
without making any arrests, 
deciding to call it “even.” 

One commenter, remarking 

on the demonstrations, said, 
“As long as no kids got raped, 
I’d say it was a good day.” While 
his comment was particularly 
insensitive, the general gist of 
most responses seemed to be that 
Saturday was a night of youthful 
fun, not a night of violence.

Similar scenes over the past 

few years — from Baltimore 
to 
Ferguson, 
Oakland 
to 

Raleigh — have not been met 

with such a warm 
reception. Instead of 
characterizing rioters 
as excited youngsters 
simply 
expressing 

their elation in an 
interesting 
way, 

these protesters were 
often called “thugs” 
and 
“animals.” 

Consequently, 
the 
same 
crimes 

(disturbing the peace, 

larceny, etc.) were met with much 
harsher punishments. In my 
opinion, this dichotomy between 
reactions is overwhelmingly due 
to the different demographics 
between 
State 
College 
and 

the cities where many similar 
demonstrations have occurred.

According 
to 
city-data.com, 

State College is almost 80-percent 
white and less than 5-percent 
Black. On the other hand, Ferguson, 
Mo. — perhaps the most famous 
case of the recent unrests — is over 
63-percent Black. Yet, only about 5 
percent of Ferguson’s police force is 
Black. This suggests some obvious 
problems, stemming from the 
fact that the police force does 
not represent the community it 
serves. Additionally, this suggests 
that the different reactions from 
the police could have had been 
rooted in the racial makeup of the 
force and its constituents.

Studies 
have 
shown 
that 

Americans 
harbor 
inherent 

racial 
biases 
toward 
certain 

demographic 
groups 
(in 
this 

case, Black people). Among these, 
white people have the highest bias 
scores against Black people, while 
Black people were the only group 
that held a favorable view toward 
Black people. Obviously, I’m not 
calling all white people racist. In 
fact, I know next to no overtly 
racist people of any race. However, 
inherent biases come out in times 
of high stress. When groups of 
African Americans congregate 

and it’s the task of an almost 
entirely white police force to quell 
the unrest, slight prejudices among 
individual police officers add up to 
make a big difference. Officers saw 
African Americans protesting in 
Ferguson as hostile actors, while 
white students in State College 
weren’t seen as “thugs.” Most 
likely, the officers in State College 
could more easily see themselves 
in the protesters, prompting much 
nicer reactions.

Finally, a comparison wouldn’t 

be complete without evaluating the 
different motives for the protests. 
In cities like Ferguson, people 
protested because of what they — 
and I — felt were the unjust killings 
of defenseless Black people: a 
protest that had the sole mission 
of granting equality to millions 
of discriminated Americans. The 
riots at Penn State, however, had no 
end goal. Students and fans simply 
took out their emotions on the 
town around them. The outcomes 
were the same (destroyed property 
and people hurt), yet only one 
group was labeled as “thugs.” 
Ironically, that group was the one 
that was protesting for legitimate 
reasons, not the one that protested 
for no real reason. Perhaps, sadly, 
the irony dissipates when we 
realize the “thugs” were primarily 
Black, who were characterized that 
way not because of their actions 
(if that were case, more people 
would be calling the Penn State 
protesters thugs) but because of 
the color of their skin.

While you can be for or against 

any form of rioting, it doesn’t seem 
right to give certain groups a pass 
while others are condemned for 
the same action. When different 
groups are guilty of the same 
crime, they should all be handed 
the same punishment. And any 
deviation 
from 
this 
standard 

is a recipe for, or more likely a 
revelation of, discrimination.

Brown prefers dudes to pawns

More than 20 years ago, Don 

Brown did what many people do 
at Yale University — he learned 
something important.

“Back when I worked for 

Carm Cozza at Yale, one of 
the things he told me was, 
‘Hey, 
those 
players 
aren’t 

chess pieces,’ ” Brown recalled 
Tuesday. 
“ 
‘They’re 
human 

beings and they want to have a 
relationship with you. So if you 
want them to play hard for you, 
develop relationships. Those are 
the things that are important.’ 
And I took that to heart.”

Now, that lesson is paying 

major dividends for Brown at 
Michigan.

When he was hired back in 

December, many praised his 
track record as an elite defensive 
mind. 
His 
Boston 
College 

defense was among the nation’s 
best last season, and he has lived 
up to that so far in Ann Arbor.

Through seven games, the 

Wolverines are the top-ranked 
unit nationally in terms of 
scoring and yardage, and while 
there’s no question the players 
on the field deserve much of the 
credit, Brown’s role in helping 
foster cohesion seems to have 
had a major hand in that.

“The most important thing 

you do is get those guys to 
understand 
we’re 
all 
in 
it 

together, 
we’re 
all 
human 

beings, we all care about one 
another,” Brown said. “And 
that’s good times and in bad. 
It’s easy to do when you’re 7-0. 
Tough to do when you’re on the 
off side of that coin.”

But having a good team isn’t 

the only way to build good will 
with 
players. 
Senior 
safety 

Dymonte Thomas called Brown 
a “great role model” and cited 
Brown’s ability to make players 
laugh to loosen things up.

“One of the things he said 

about the linebackers, he’s like, 
‘This play, you’ve gotta do this. 
If you don’t do this play, you’re 
fired, and then I’m going to get 
fired,’ ” Thomas said Monday. 

“And we just all start laughing. 
… If you make a mistake, he’s 
going to yell at you, but at the 
same time, he’s only yelling at 
you because he loves you.

“I got yelled at a few times 

early 
in 
the 

season, and he 
just said, ‘You 
know I love you, 
but as a senior 
you can’t make 
plays like that, 
and we need you 
to do better. So 
let’s go out there 
and 
practice, 

let’s get better 
today.’ He just 
says things like that to motivate 
you to make you want to do 
better for him.”

It’s not like the Wolverines 

were playing for a slouch before 
Brown, 
either. 
D.J. 
Durkin 

was 
the 
Michigan 
defensive 

coordinator last season, and he 
was good enough to earn a head 
coaching job at Maryland, where 
he has the Terrapins sitting at 5-2.

There’s no reason to believe 

Durkin didn’t connect with his 

players in similar ways, but there 
are certainly benefits to Brown’s 
extensive career in coaching.

One of those benefits is one 

of Brown’s more lighthearted, 
tried-and-true methods. During 

spring practice, 
he would give 
out “Dude of the 
Day” 
awards 

every so often on 
Twitter. He has 
not 
publicized 

one since March 
20, 
but 
the 

award has been 
well-received 
in the Michigan 
community, 

whether by fans or players.

He carried the term with him 

from Boston College, and when 
he left the Eagles, he found out 
how much it meant to them, too.

“It’s funny, when I left B.C., 

some of the B.C. people said, ‘Oh, 
he’s stealing our ‘Dude of the 
Week,’ ” Brown said. “Well, wait 
a minute. That was my ‘Dude of 
the Week.’ I let you borrow it.”

Being called a “dude” is 

the highest compliment from 

Brown, a step up from the term 
“guy,” which is also meant as a 
term of endearment.

“If you go back and ask some 

of the players about 20 years 
ago, I used to say, ‘Will you just 
be a guy?’ ” Brown said. “And as 
times have gotten more modern, 
it went from guy to dude. Now, if 
you’re a guy, you’re here. Which 
is good. Being a guy is good. But 
if you’re a dude, you’re up here 
(gesturing higher).”

For Thomas, winning a ‘Dude 

of the Day’ award represented 
something of a white whale during 
the spring. (“I always thought 
maybe I’m going to get it one day,” 
he said. “And I never got it.”)

Fortunately for the senior 

safety, 
though, 
Brown 
isn’t 

afraid to give credit where 
it’s due. Maybe it’s part of his 
commitment to show players he 
cares, or maybe he just doesn’t 
like effort to go unrecognized.

So even without a formal 

tweet to announce it, Brown 
made one thing clear Tuesday.

“My son was telling me about 

Dymonte Thomas,” Brown said. 
“He’s a dude.”

Players speak highly of relationships defensive coordinator has built in first year

FOOTBALL
Speight earns trust of 
Fisch, coaching staff

Redshirt 
sophomore 

quarterback 
Wilton 
Speight 

and passing game coordinator 
Jedd Fisch both agree: Speight’s 
performance against Illinois 
was his best yet.

He led the Michigan football 

team to its seventh win of the 
season in dominating fashion, 
completing 16 of 23 attempts for 
253 yards and two touchdowns. 
He made short passes and long 
passes, and only seemed to 
falter on a handful of plays.

Speight, 
who 
spent 
time 

during the bye week reflecting 
on his first six games, came 
out and didn’t miss a beat. He 
attributes part of the success to 
simply throwing and not aiming.

“It’s 
just 
like 
baseball 

with 
pitchers; 

sometimes 
you’re thinking 
too much and 
you’re 
trying 

to put it in a 
certain 
spot 

when 
you’re 

thinking about 
not 
following 

through,” Fisch 
said. “It’s just 
different than, 
‘I’m going to go out and rip it,’ 
so to speak.”

To 
non-quarterbacks, 

aiming might sound like a 
good thing. It should be part 
of the recipe, along with arm 
strength and decisiveness. But 
at the college level, it could 
break the quarterback.

“When 
you 
aim 
it, 
it’s 

sometimes 
when 
you 
start 

overthinking,” Fisch said. “I 
think that’s kinda what he was 
thinking about. That it was 
more of, ‘Do I take a little bit 
off of this’ or, ‘Do I not follow 
through as much?’ rather than 
just go out there and play loose.”

As 
Speight 
gets 
more 

comfortable throwing the ball, 
he’s noticeably getting better 
at making last-second decisions 
on the field, too. 

In the first quarter, when 

the Wolverines were already 
up by two touchdowns, Speight 
displayed some of that patience. 
He took the snap on Illinois’ 
16-yard line, and senior tight 
end Jake Butt and freshman 
wide receiver Kekoa Crawford 
ran downfield. 

But neither player was able 

to get open, and Speight saw his 
chance to rush down the right 
sideline for 10 yards. Michigan 
scored again three plays later, 
putting the Wolverines up 21-0 
over the Fighting Illini. 

“I think it was a nice step the 

other day when he took off and 
ran for about nine yards when 
there wasn’t anyone to throw it 
to,” Fisch said. “I think they’re 
understanding when it’s time to 
cut your losses, so to speak, and 
know that you’ll live another 

play 
and 

have 
another 

opportunity.”

Speight 
isn’t 

a 
scrambling 

quarterback, but 
now 
opponents 

know 
that 

they can’t just 
worry 
about 

his 
throwing 

game. 
If 
he’s 

comfortable with 

tucking the ball in and running 
with it, he’s much more of a threat.

Of course, he wouldn’t be so 

confident if he didn’t trust himself 
to make good throws, too. 

This season, Speight has 

thrown 
182 
passes. 
Fisch 

said that the quarterback has 
learned from every single one 
of them, which also helps the 
coaches find the best ways to 
use him.

“It’s kind of hard to explain, 

but you just drop back and you 
don’t say, ‘Oh gosh, I need to put 
it right here or else it’s going to 
be incomplete,’ ” Speight said. 
“No college quarterback is in 
college playing football because 
they aimed the ball growing up 
and playing quarterback their 
whole life. You just let it rip, and 
that was my focus.”

‘M’ rallies at Indiana in 
regular-season finale

On the road Wednesday in 

its regular-season finale, the 
Michigan women’s soccer team 
managed to 
erase a one-
goal deficit, 
snap a five-
game winless streak and secure 
a first-round home match in 
the Big Ten Tournament, all 
with two goals in the final six 
minutes.

The Wolverines now host No. 

5 seed Wisconsin on Sunday 
to 
open 
the 

conference 
tournament 
by 
virtue 
of 

a 
thrilling 

comeback 
victory.

In the 84th 

minute, 
senior 

forward 
Nicky 

Waldeck 
received a pass 
from 
redshirt 

junior midfielder Ani Sarkisian 
and converted a shot in the 
lower-right corner of the net to 
even the score at 2-2.

Minutes 
later, 
Sarkisian 

headed the ball into the middle 
of goal, giving the Wolverines 
the go-ahead score with just 
over two minutes left in the 
contest.

The game went back and forth 

between the teams, with each 
Michigan goal coming after a 
Hoosier score before Sarkisian’s 
game-winner.

“I think we just realized that 

we weren’t going to be able to 
score from outside,” Sarkisian 
said. “We had to drive the ball in 
and take people on one-v.-one, 

and we learned that throughout 
the game, and that’s really what 
clicked for us.”

The game started off slowly 

for the Wolverines — the team 
converted just one of nine shots 
during the first half.

“(We) 
had 
the 
clear 

opportunities and the clear 
chances (in the first half), 
and you could tell from the 
scoreboard that we had way 
more shots,” Sarkisian said. 
“We were definitely in charge of 
the game and the tempo but we 
couldn’t score.”

The victory ended a five-

game 
winless 

streak, 
which 

saw three losses 
and two ties for 
the Wolverines.

“I think after 

going 
5-0 
in 

the Big Ten in 
the 
beginning 

(of 
conference 

play) 
kinda 

put a target on 
our back, and I 

know teams were coming out 
and playing their best against 
us to knock us out of first 
place,” Sarkisian said. “We 
really needed this win, and it’s 
just something that we were 
working so hard for over these 
last couple games that it’s nice 
to see our hard work finally 
pay off.”

With 
the 
win, 
Michigan 

secured the fourth seed in the 
Big Ten Tournament and will 
host fifth-seeded Wisconsin on 
Sunday in the quarterfinals.

“It’s really something good to 

build on,” Sarkisian said. “We’ll 
watch film and see what we did 
well, and we’ll see what we did 
bad and what we can fix.”

“Macbeth”

It was a particularly cold 

evening last October when I 
received the mark of the devil by 
a witch. We were gathered, five 
of us, on her bed, when she lit a 
candle and pulled out a needle. 
It was attached to a No. 2 pencil 
with a piece of string. Sliding 
the tiny blade beneath the flame, 
she walked me through the 
process one more time. So when 
a 
pointillism 
pentagram 
was 

stabbed, one needle prick at a 
time, into the flesh of my pelvis, 
I was ready. Also, the Spice Girls 
were playing.

My friend Helena — tall, silver-

haired, 
perpetually 
wearing 

black — has many tattoos, most 
of which are self-administered. 
When she offered to give me one 
for my 21st birthday last year, I 
was totally on board. College is 
a time for self-discovery, when 
you make mistakes on purpose. 
I don’t regret my stick-and-poke 
tattoo, but to me all it symbolized 
was a youthful indiscretion. It’s 
also tiny, smaller than my thumb 
nail and nestled in a place future 
employers won’t find fault with. 
For me, it’s just a tattoo, and I 
picked a pentagram because I 
thought it would be easier for her 
to draw. For others, it means much 
more.

While 
many 
religions 
are 

practiced on the University of 
Michigan 
campus, 
Wicca 
is 

perhaps the least acknowledged. 
They aren’t making headlines 
or 
causing 
controversy, 
but 

practitioners of the mystical arts 
are as real at the University as 
their beliefs, and so are the fruits 
of their labor. This October, I 
decided I wanted to learn about 
this 
faction 
of 
our 
campus 

community.

I thought of the first place I 

could go in Ann Arbor to find 
witches: Crazy Wisdom Bookstore 
& Tea Room, a cuckoo-for-cocoa-
puffs bookshop located on Main 
Street and East Huron Street. I’d 
gone in once before for the coffee, 
but would have never dreamed of 
buying something in there.

During my visit, I float past 

the glowing crystals and bottled 
incense to reach the shelf of the 
supernatural. My eyes flick across 
words on book spines, and I know 
I’m on the right track — demons, 
vampires. A small collection of 
Joseph Campbell. But no witches.

I keep walking, past some 

intensely tie-dyed scarves and 
entire shelves of incense, until I 
find one devoted to witchcraft. I 
grab two formidable looking texts 
— “Wicca: The Complete Craft” 
and “The Everything Spells and 
Charms Book” — and steal away to 
the tea shop upstairs.

I place my order and flop the 

texts on a window table until the 
barista conjures up a cup of joe. 
The mug warmed by my filtered 
coffee bears the phrase “Om 
Shanti,” which is Sanskrit and is 
also the store’s slogan. “Om” is 
the sacred sound of the universe, 
while 
“shanti” 
means 
peace. 

This definition is written on an 
index card behind the counter 
for the barista’s reference in case 
nosy customers (such as myself) 
inquire about it.

The 
cafe 
is 
surprisingly 

well-lit given the merchandise 
downstairs. The tea shop takes up 
the entire second floor, with big 
bay windows on either side of the 
room. The ceiling is constructed 
with faux-foil ceiling tiles, from 
which elaborate light fixtures 
drip to illuminate the many comfy 
chairs and tables. Wall sconces 
are 
mounted 
on 
the 
purple 

wallpaper, which is also adorned 
with clay blocks painted with 
tarot card symbols. I see angels 
and skeletons, castles and devils 
from my spot by the east-facing 
window. 

The mug also bears the image 

of a naked woman reclining on 
the back of a tiger. I think of this 
as lewd for 0.05 seconds until I 
recall how the Starbucks symbol 
is just as mystical and vaguely 
pornographic.

I tell the barista I’m a reporter 

from The Michigan Daily writing 
about witches. She smiles at me.

“You’ve come to the right 

place.”

Every second Tuesday of the 

month, Crazy Wisdom hosts a 
Witch’s Night Out, in which a 
diverse group gathers in the tea 
house and drinks one potion — 
Good Fortune of Dion Witch’s 
Brew. A blend of hibiscus flowers, 
blackberry leaves, orange peel, 
apple pieces and sunflower, it’s 
a popular herbal blend on the 
beverage menu. However, it does 
not 
tote 
mystical 
properties, 

according to the disclaimer on the 
bottom right of the menu: “Medical 
herbs work best in conjunction 
with a healthy lifestyle.” I was 
right to order coffee.

I’m flipping through the spell 

book first, because of its enticing 
tagline — “Cast incantations that 
will bring you love, success, and 
good health.” I plan on getting to 
the love spells at some point, but 
with my student loans looming 
over me, I’m keen to try the 
Goodbye Debt Spell.

Tools, instead of ingredients, 

are as follows: one large iron pot 
or cauldron, the five of pentacles 
from a tarot deck you don’t use. (I 
feel as though something terrible 
is about to happen to this five of 
pentacles. But what the hell is a 
pentacle?) Finish it off with cedar 
wood chips, sticks or shakes. 
When to concoct it? During the 
waxing moon, of course.

I’m instructed to put the piece 

of wood in the pot, light it on 
fire and slip the card from one of 
my multiple tarot decks into the 
flames. On the night before the 
next new moon, I’m to bury the 
ashes far from my house. I shut the 
book hard enough to startle the 
girl on her phone at the next table.

In the other book I learn the 

origins of the term Wicca, which 
comes from the Old English 
word 
wicce, 
meaning 
“wise” 

or “wisdom.” This tea house is 
basically called “crazy witch.”

It’s time to get out of here.
“Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and caldron bubble.”

“Macbeth”

LSA senior Kit Kelly, who 

is 
celebrating 
her 
two-year 

practicing anniversary, tells me 
she wants to make it known that 
she, among other practitioners 
of Wicca, aren’t flighty granola 
hippies. And she doesn’t have 
warts, either.

Kelly 
writes 
in 
an 
email 

interview 
that 
while 
Wicca 

may fall under the category of 
Pagan religions — those that are 
influenced by worship of nature — 
being Pagan does not necessitate 
Wiccan 
beliefs. 
The 
religion 

borrows heavily from other Pagan 
practices, like observing Yule and 
Samhain rather than Christmas 
and Halloween.

There are more than a few 

misconceptions about the Wiccan 
practice that Kelly writes she 
wants to smooth over, and chief 
among these concerns is that it’s 
not some weird hobby.

“First, I think it’s definitely 

possible to be invested in scientific 
logic and also participate in 
Wicca — intention and thought 
has been studied a great deal, and 
our attitudes towards ourselves 
and others have a great deal of 
influence in the physical world,” 
Kelly wrote. “Second, there are 
so many varieties of witchcraft 
that trying to lump us in under 
one stereotype is inaccurate and, 
frankly, offensive.”

Kelly said the end of October 

is the perfect time to discuss 
Wiccan faith given the series 
of misrepresentations that are 
produced by Halloween costumes. 
She believes cartoonish depictions 
of Wicca and witches cast negative 
stereotypes from practitioners in 
the Roma culture — often referred 
to as “gypsy,” nomenclature that 
has been flagged as less than 
politically correct — that have 
equally negative ramifications on 
those who practice witchcraft.

“We are your friends, your 

classmates, your neighbors and 
I encourage you to treat us with 
as much respect as you treat your 
Christian, Jewish or Muslim 
friends — our beliefs are all valid 
and important and we shouldn’t 
be ostracized or stereotyped just 
because we believe in magic,” 
Kelly wrote.

“I was going to fight vampires, 

and my name wasn’t Buffy — I was 

so screwed.”

Briggs, 
“Frost 

Burned”

Most Wiccans on campus just 

want to be left alone — like Art & 
Design junior Ellen Erikson*, who 
identifies not as a Wiccan but as a 
bona fide witch.

“It is a common misconception 

that Wicca is the only type of 
witchcraft,” Erikson wrote in an 
email interview. “While Wicca 
is most often duotheistic and 
recognizes two specific deities, the 
‘God’ and ‘Goddess,’ witchcraft 
as a whole is much more open-
ended.”

Erikson has been practicing 

for a year and a half. When she 
was in high school, her friend’s 
grandmother, a former witch, 
introduced her to the craft and 
lent her a small library of books to 
get her started.

“At the time, it seemed almost 

too good to be true, and although 
I fervently tried a few spells, 
Witchcraft 
always 
felt 
like 

something distant and inaccessible 
to me,” Erikson wrote.

(She describes her sophomore 

year of college as tumultuous. 
Deciding 
to 
transfer 
to 
the 

University after spending two 
years adjusting to her previous 
school, she had found making 
friends and overcoming the stress 
and uncertainty of freshman 
year at her former school was 
challenging. She was unhappy 
where she was, but transferring 
could have easily worsened the 
problems she was having.

Over and over, she asked 

herself: Is Michigan really where 
I want to be? Will it be worth it? 
Where do I belong?

“Although 
my 
family 

encouraged me to make the 
change, advisors, professors and 
other students cautioned me on 
the potential mistake I could be 
making,” Erikson wrote. “I felt 
stuck at a fork in the road for a 
long time. At last, I took one of the 
biggest leaps of faith I have taken 
and transferred.”

It was still difficult — she 

coped with the mounting stress 
associated with culture shock 
and readjustment by partying and 
going out more. But Erikson didn’t 
feel present in social situations 
and had trouble making her art.

“The first time I called myself 

a ‘Witch’ was the most magical 
moment of my life.”

— 
Margot 
Adler, 
“Drawing 

Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, 
Goddess-Worshippers, and Other 
Pagans in America”

The turning point for Erikson 

came the summer after her second 
year of college. She went home and 
relaxed in the familiar company 
of her family and friends. After 
leaving the nest of her hometown 
with a greater appreciation and 
deeper understanding of her own 
spirituality, she threw herself back 
into witchcraft.

“Developing 
my 
practice 

became a huge creative outlet for 
me, which both provided me with 
means of tackling my anxiousness 
and self doubt, and helped me 
reconnect with creating art,” 
Erikson wrote. “Although those 
years were difficult for me, those 
experiences helped me grow as a 
person.”

Kelly wrote that she first got 

involved with Wiccan practices 
after 
suffering 
from 
chronic 

anxiety issues, and feelings of 
being out of control. A friend 
recommended 
she 
look 
into 

the religion as simply a way of 
exercising control.

“At first the rituals were a great 

way to ease my nerves, but I found 
very quickly that intention is 
powerful, and my casting had a lot 
more of an effect on my life than 
I thought it would,” Kelly wrote. 
“Take it from a skeptic and a past 
atheist — the brain is an incredible 
organ and is capable of influencing 
our paths in extraordinary ways.”

According 
to 
Erikson, 

witchcraft exists on a spectrum of 
theologies and practices unique to 
the practitioner.

“I recently came across the 

phrase ‘re-enchanting the world,’ 
which I believe captures the 
essence of what magic means to 
me,” Erikson wrote. “Practicing 
witchcraft has revived my sense of 
mystery and wonder in the world, 
and given me room to develop a 
relationship with spirituality, on 
my own terms.”

For her, whether you’re casting 

spells, doodling sigils during class 
or throwing crystals and herbs 
in your pocket for a little extra 
support on your way to an exam, 
being a witch on campus is just 
plain fun.

“Your average witch is not, 

by nature, a social animal as far 
as other witches are concerned. 

MAGICAL
From Page 1B

 On its surface, “Psycho 
Killer” is the kind of track 
perfect for pretending you’re 
in some spunky retro music 
video. Walking along a dark, 
rainy alley, the steady beat 
drops in just as an inexplicable 
fog wafts across your path. 
It’s spooky, yet playful as 
you saunter to the beat of the 
music. Byrne’s unsteady voice 
makes the thought of actually 
being confronted with a crazy 
murderer seem not at all as 
daunting as its reality.
 When listening more closely 

to the lyrics Byrne is so casually 
spitting, though, the catchy 
sheen begins to ship away to 
reveal something more sinister. 
That first, haunting chorus is 
preceded by, “I can’t sleep cause 
my bed’s on fire / Don’t touch 
me I’m a real live wire.” Byrne’s 
vocals go on to become more 

and more unhinged — much 
like the psyche of the titular 
killer. The repeated fa-fa-fa’s are 
almost manic, warning listeners 
of the madness behind them. By 
the end of the track, that jaunt 
through the alley turns from 
benign to life-threatening.

“Psycho Killer”

Talking Heads

SIRE RECORDS

There’s a conflict of dominant 
personalities. There’s a group 
of ringleaders without a ring. 
There’s the basic unwritten rule of 
witchcraft, which is ‘Don’t do what 
you will, do what I say.’ The natural 
size of a coven is one. Witches only 
get together when they can’t avoid 
it.”

— Terry Pratchett, “Witches 

Abroad”

Erikson said she wishes there 

were opportunities to network 
in her community, but as most 
witches that don’t broadcast part 
of their identity, it’s difficult to get 
out and meet other Wiccans and 
witches. When she first came to 
Ann Arbor, she was disheartened 
by the infrequency with which 
local meetups occur — and rarely 
on campus.

“Asking people if they are a 

witch isn’t exactly the best way to 
start a conversation. Personally, 
I would love to be a part of a 
witchy community on campus,” 
she wrote. “I believe that having 
the ability to practice with others 
would strengthen my belief in my 
own spirituality.”

Kelly belongs to a coven of 

witches in the Midwest called 
the Coven of Stars, but noted 
that getting all of its members 
together can be difficult. The 
past few years, she’s ventured 
as far as Kalamazoo to celebrate 
Samhain with a few of the coven’s 
members, but the whole of their 
order has yet to convene at once.

“When we gather, we tend to 

plan the rituals we do in advance, 
and these typically relate to the 
holiday we’re celebrating,” Kelly 
wrote. “On Samhain, we create a 
bonfire and do a lot of cleansing 
and try to cast for new beginnings, 
because it’s the holiday that marks 
the end of the harvest season and 
the beginning of a new part of the 
year.”

For 
Kelly, 
Facebook 
has 

been an incredible resource in 
finding other witches, and to 
crowdsource ideas for spells. She’s 
also been part of several groups 
online that do outreach work with 
new witches and discuss different 
factions of witchcraft.

Kelly wrote that she considers 

herself a moon priestess, and her 
practice focuses a great deal on 
healing and cleansing. Last year, 
she was able to attend HexFest in 
New Orleans, which is a festival 
that brings practitioners together 
from across the country.

“I was able to meet and learn 

from a few voodoo practitioners,” 
she wrote. “Voodoo is based 
in African lore and focuses on 
making deals with spirits in order 
to gain power. The origins and 
practice of this kind of magic 
is so far flung from what I’m 
comfortable with, and I think it’s 
silly to try to group us together.”

“Wisdom is one of the few things 

that looks bigger the further away 
it is.”

— Terry Pratchett, “Witches 

Abroad”

For me, the road to the witch’s 

house is lined with sorority 
houses. Erikson has agreed to 
perform a little something with 
me, but it’s shocking that she 
could 
have 
possibly 
escaped 

identification as a witch in a sea 

of Canada Goose jackets and 
pumpkin spice lattes.

Erikson says she’s not sure 

how much her roommate knows 
about her status as a practicing 
witch, but isn’t too worried about 
it coming out.

“Why would someone suspect 

somebody else is a witch?” 
Erikson said. “I think that’s a 
weird thing to think. But once you 
do know, I think there’s a lot of 
little indicators.”

Erikson’s room features many 

artifacts that I find strange and 
sobering. Strange would be the 
colony of crystals on her bedside 
table that she refers to as an altar, 
and sobering are the posters 
on her wall — Blondie, and the 
quintessentially collegiate “Pulp 
Fiction” — that could just as 
easily hang in my room. Also the 
shoes under her table, black with 
chunky heels, are the same pair 
that just came in the mail from my 
online order.

The spell she has chosen will 

bring good luck and prosperity — 
but I’m reminded about an earlier 
goal and ask about love spells.

“Oh man, those are always 

tricky,” she says. “I’ve done them 
too, but I’ve always felt weird 
about them. I do the ones (where) 
I’m calling someone, so they 
come to me, so I don’t feel like I’m 
manipulating anything. But those 
are really fun to do.”

Sitting on the floor of her room, 

she pulls out a small journal and 
a massive English dictionary. She 
cracks the cover of the latter to 
reveal a secret compartment from 
which she extracts the spell’s 
ingredients. I watch as she forms 
a pentagram using three yellow 
tea candles and a figurine of a 
black cat. They will represent the 
four directions — air, water, fire 
and earth — as well as one for 
spirituality. Usually she uses five 
candles, but she’s running low. 
For the point representing fire, 
she uses a small cone of incense 
that she picked up in Santa Fe 
because of the smell. She ignites 
the incense with a hot pink lighter.

She pulls out the journal, her 

book of spells, and flips through 
the pages.

“I used to keep it just lying out, 

but my roommate told me that 
she read it,” Erikson said. “So I 
was like, ‘OK, I’m going to move 
it now.’” 

She explains each ingredient as 

she spills it into a clear glass jar the 
size of my second toe, carefully 
held over a black bowl that will 
be taking the place of a cauldron. 
She doesn’t have basil, so she subs 
in frankincense. Otherwise, the 
mixture of pink sea salt, pepper 
(to force out negative energy), 
all spice, nutmeg and regular 
table salt that make up the spell 
becomes my keepsake.

Because she is so rarely alone, 

Erikson mainly performs simple 
spells and rituals.

“In a dorm, there’s always 

people around,” Erikson said. 
“Like, I never know when my 
roommate is going to pop back in. 
Even if I know she’s not coming 
back for a certain time, I feel if 
someone might come in. It just 
distracts me.”

Some 
spells 
have 
chants, 

something that Erikson finds a 
little too kooky. She prefers to 
perform in silence, focusing her 
energy on the ingredients that 
she’s adding. Standing in for a 
wand, Erikson waves a green 
crystal in a stirring motion over 
the concoction.

She blows out the candles, 

counter-clockwise, ending the 
spell. She lets the incense burn, 
and the aroma fills the entire 
room. Later, as I’m standing on 

the sidewalk waiting for my Uber, 
I can still smell it on my jacket.

“Since man cannot live without 

miracles, he will provide himself 
with miracles of his own making. 
He will believe in witchcraft and 
sorcery, even though he may 
otherwise be a heretic, an atheist, 
and a rebel.”

— Fyodor Dostoyevsky, “The 

Brothers Karamazov”

Armed with these fresh aromas 

and perceptions, I return to Crazy 
Wisdom. The invisible cloud of 
herbs which greets you at the 
door — a combination of sage, rose, 
sandalwood, lavender and thyme 
— smells exactly how hugging my 
grandmother feels. I allow myself 
to remember for the first time in 
years a similar store that I went to 
in high school called Earth Lore, 
in Plymouth, Mich., not far from 
where I grew up. There were more 
artifacts than books in the shop, 
and I would go with my best friend 
Gina after class and gawk at the tiny 
Buddha statues, or look at the rows 
of incense sticks in a kaleidoscope 
of colors. I don’t remember 
thinking it was ridiculous, or 
looking down on those who would 
go in. We got a kick out of it in a 
voyeuristic, indulgent way. Like 
seeing a romantic comedy with 
your friends. It was a burst, brief 
and pure, of joy.

I sit at the same table as last 

week where the same smiling 
waitress deposits a cup of coffee 
in front of me, and I reflect on the 
utter tranquility of the scene.

A blond boy is lounging on 

a gray couch scattered with 
textbooks, tucked beneath a table, 
which holds a pot of tea belonging 
to the woman in glasses and a gray 
sweater. Two women sit only a 
few feet away from me, bodies 
bent toward each other over their 
round table, speaking in tones as 
smooth and secretive as the light 
gurgle my coffee makes when 
I take a sip. Something soft is 
playing that reminds me of a song 
by Colin Hay.

I consider the deadlines of the 

newspaper to which I have sewn 
my time and lifeforce. I consider 
unfinished class assignments, how 
often I’ve talked to my parents and 
whether or not I’ve disappointed a 
friend by my constant away status, 
like an AIM reminder that I’m not 
as present as I could be in my own 
life. I think about how over the 
course of writing this article, I’ve 
dyed my hair black and started to 
wear the color more frequently. 
I look at my tattoo and wonder 
whether or not it means more to 
me than I first thought.

Traffic 
continues 
to 
pass 

beneath the window to my left. 
A construction crew tears into 
the concrete of the street with a 
construction machine that looks 
like a massive shovel. Children 
pass in strollers, pushed by 
parents on their cell phones. And 
yet I can’t hear any of it. A jazzy 
tune with a faster tempo takes 
off in the tea shop. The espresso 
machine whines. I sip my coffee. 
This room, this space, is an oasis 
of peace. It kind of feels like magic.

“

You’re an English major? 
Well … what are you going 
to do with that?”

Ah, I see. You’re relying on 

notions of practicality 
rather than considering 
the 
true 
reasoning 

behind why I study 
what I do. That’s not 
wise. 
If 
I’m 
going 

to devote my life to 
something, it might as 
well be something I’m 
passionate about. I’m 
not really interested 
in the idea of earning 
higher salaries in the 
future or leaving college with a 
more applicable and competitive 
degree in the workplace.

Recently, I’ve been motivated to 

think more about the purpose of 
the humanities after a discussion 
I had in one of my classes the 
other day. We were talking about 
budget cuts across high schools 
and colleges all over the country, 
grappling with the fact that the 
first departments to be cut from 
these institutions are, of course, 
the humanities.

The 
highest 
post-college 

salaries come from degrees in 
engineering, computer science, 
mathematics and the natural 
sciences. Surprising? Probably not. 
Our conversation in class started 
to develop into one I think is worth 
sharing.

What is the accessibility of 

our work in the humanities? 
That is, are the products of our 
departments, such as literary 
theory, 
research, 
language, 

books and art understood by 
populations 
across 
academia? 

As a class, we pondered the idea 
that maybe, for people outside 
humanities departments, there’s a 
divide simply because of a lack of 
understanding.

Of course, if I were put in an 

engineering course, I would not 
have the slightest idea of what I was 
learning. It’s a foreign language to 
me. Granted, while discussing the 

value of an engineering degree, 
it’s not as difficult to figure out 
how it could be used. There are 
plenty of companies interested in 

hiring students who 
are well-educated in 
that particular field. 
From discussions I 
have had with people 
about the study of 
literature and what 
an 
English 
degree 

provides in general, 
I get the sense they 
don’t 
know 
what’s 

really happening in 
the world of language 

and literature.

The stereotype of a humanities 

student 
is 
one 
that 
carries 

around a lot of books all day and 
is almost always writing essays. 
That is fairly true, but there are 
dimensions 
of 
meaning 
that 

I think no other departments 
capture more fully than the 
humanities. Recently, I heard 
a student say that studying the 
humanities is, in essence, getting 
closer to the idea of what it means 
to be human. In addition, we 
understand our history more 
clearly, as fundamental human 
nature across time is, for the 
most part, about the same. The 
discussion 
sparked 
my 
own 

questioning of why people might 
be missing the value of what 
humanities is doing in an academic 
setting, thus justifying sources of 
funding to be reallocated to other 
places. If people don’t understand 
what is being produced from 
departments that study humanity, 
they aren’t going to recognize the 
purpose.

The heart of this discussion 

comes 
from 
understandings 

of 
rhetoric. 
Merriam-Webster 

defines this term as “the art or skill 
of speaking or writing formally 
and effectively especially as a way 
to persuade or influence people,” 
which I think, in a lot of ways, is the 
central goal of my study of English. 
We decided in class that rhetoric is 

determined by culture. How are 
we, as a culture, as a people and as 
individuals, using our language to 
persuade and instigate change?

Understanding 
language 

through the medium of writing 
is also essential, as writing works 
as an effective tool in almost 
every profession. Often, students 
who aren’t familiar or interested 
in 
humanities 
courses 
are 

discouraged by how sophisticated 
they feel language has to be used 
to appear “intelligent” or for 
writing to be considered “good.” 
For the many who are not sold 
on the idea that departments in 
the humanities are worth the 
investment, classes focused on 
exploring the complex realms of 
language, both foreign languages 
or concepts with English, are 
generally cut.

The idea of taking classes “for 

a job” is baffling to me. The value 
of learning is being hidden, or 
perhaps replaced, by the need to 
“train” for post-grad life. Students 
are being molded into a product 
that will be of high demand 
in the workforce, rather than 
developing a mind that is able to 
think, question and challenging 
existing ideas. It occurred to me 
that if a department is cut because 
it is considered irrelevant, the 
foundation that learning is built 
upon will start to break down.

Passion and interest lie on 

one side of the spectrum, with 
employability and competiveness 
on the other. What remains 
between both extremes is what 
one decides is our purpose at 
an institution such as this one. 
Learning how to do a certain 
job is not as important as simply 
learning how to learn. My study of 
English literature and language is 
capturing the human experience 
— one that in any job, with any 
degree, must be understood.

Midnight Diner Dreams of Sushi.

Sometimes the best stories 

take place in the most unlikely 
places. This principle provides 
the foundation for “Midnight 
Diner,” the new 
Japanese language 
Netflix 
Original 

series 
centering 

around 
Meshiya, 

a small restaurant 
tucked away off 
the main streets 
of 
Tokyo, 
its 

proprietor known 
as Master (Kaoru 
Kobayashi, 
“The 

Great 
Passage”) 

and the patrons 
who find themselves there 
between midnight and 7 a.m. 
when the restaurant is open. 
And it’s during those hours that 
the most compelling stories 
are revealed about the show’s 
miscellaneous characters.

The sympathetic Master has 

only pork miso soup and a few 
drinks on his menu, but will 
make anything his customers 
order as long as he has the 
ingredients. Like his menu, 
customers get more than what 
they see when they dine at 
Meshiya. Both regulars and 
newcomers 
alike 
converge 

at the small, almost hidden 
location under the pretense of 
a simple late-night meal. But 
Master serves up his meals 
with quiet comfort — exuding 
an aura that invites customers 
to share their stories with him 
and with us.

Under the warm auspices 

of Master, customers divulge 
information about themselves 
that they otherwise wouldn’t. 

Perhaps it’s the sense of home 
that’s cooked into his meals. We 
first learn about them through 
the food they order — a culinary 
treat to behold in itself. As the 
food sizzles over the stove, 
the same sense of comfort 

that 
draws 
in 

his 
customers 

washes 
over 

us. The food is 
served up with 
the stories.

It 
isn’t 
so 

much an action 
or 
pressing 

challenge 
that 

spurs the story 
as it is a chance 
encounter 
between 
two 

customers, 
facilitated 
by 

Master’s 
quiet 
acceptance 

and the restaurant’s intimate 
atmosphere. Their individual 
stories intersect at Meshiya, 
where 
the 
true 
narrative 

begins.

While 
the 
series 
itself 

lacks meaningful action and 
structural variety, it makes 
up for it in heart. The premise 
appeals to our basic humanity 
— the feeling that we are 
understood 
and 
welcomed 

somewhere. That somewhere 
is Master’s diner, which serves 
as a character itself. The lone 
counter encloses Master in his 
kitchen, where he is surrounded 
by his customers. They interact 
with the diner as they would 
with another character, sharing 
their innermost thoughts and 
feelings. As they go about their 
lives, they continuously return 
to the diner where their actions 
and 
experiences 
are 
given 

meaning and context.

A taxi driver and former 

actress encounter a radio host 
one night in the first episode. 
At first, the two have nothing 
in common, as most strangers 
do, but the woman orders an 
unusual dish that strikes his 
curiosity and he begins to dig 
deeper into her life, uncovering 
a past she wished to forget. 
The understated emotion with 
which the two characters touch 
one another’s lives is reflective 
of the significance of a series 
like “Midnight Diner,” in which 
the focus of the series is not 
on the characters themselves, 
but on how their serendipitous 
interactions shape each other’s 
lives.

It may not be the most 

exciting series. The story and 
its action unfold primarily 
through the dialogue, making 
for lulls in the narrative’s 
development. But this allows 
for 
moments 
of 
poignant 

commentary and specific detail 
from the characters that bring 
to life the awareness we often 
lack for those around us.

Despite 
the 
cultural 

specificity of “Midnight Diner,” 
the series touches on a concept 
that is familiar to all: food 
and comfort. That’s probably 
why the series was adapted 
from the bestselling Japanese 
manga series Shinya Shokudo 
by Yaro Abe and later adapted 
into a film directed by Joji 
Matsuoka. There’s something 
both compelling and accessible 
about food that brings the wide 
variety of stories in “Midnight 
Diner” within reach of its 
audience. 
While 
customers 

come and go, Master, his diner 
and his food remain a constant 
— anchoring the series’ stories 
with harmony and compassion.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK

It’s a bold move to name a 

debut album 4 4 with track 
titles like “Koh-It-T Us” and 
“D a H J A” and it takes an 
even more talented singer-
songwriter to deliver.

Marz Léon does just that.
An alternative R&B artist, 

Léon released her nine-track 
album in late August with the 
intent to describe her personal 
experiences 
and 
emotions 

through a universal lens. In 
an interview with The Fader, 
Marz stated, “4 4 resembles 
my guardian angels protecting 
me 
through 
my 
struggles 

and helping to give me the 
willpower 
to 
continue 
to 

pursue my passion, everything 
that I love, and battles in 
my life.” Since then, the Los 
Angeles-based solo act has also 
recently directed, edited and 
released the music video for 
her latest single, “S O R E E,” 
herself.

4 4 opens with “Bipolar,” 

an emotional and electronic 
ode to heartbreak. With a 
steady, satisfying bass line, 
the first track leaves no stone 
unturned with direct lyrics 
like, “Heaven’s waiting for you 

/ Don’t put him up there / Put 
me up, don’t take him up,” and, 
“You’ll leave me drowning in 
your poison / Don’t leave me 
open.” Léon lays everything 
out on the table and segues 
seamlessly 
into 
“D.Frncs 

Interlude.”

The interlude is eerie and 

less musically invested as it is 
a reflection on Léon herself. 
She speaks, “Perhaps / This 
is the moment / When you’ve 
been chosen / To lead an 
army of broken soldiers / To 
lead a group of sheep / Into 
the lions’ den.” She preaches 
parables to her listeners about 
individuality, leadership and 
personal 
accountability. 
It’s 

powerful, short and makes 
a lasting impact early in the 
album.

“D a H J A” follows with 

heavy vocals and dramatic 
drumbeats 
that 
resonate 

throughout 
the 
body. 

Layering her own voice and 
interchanging it with breathy 
gasps adds a sensual element to 
an otherwise steady song. The 
bridge is strong and quick as 
Léon sings, “Pretend that you 
don’t hear me / Only I can feel 
me / Now I’m thinking clearly / 
Got to keep moving on.”

The second half of the album 

strays towards synthetics with 
“P a R a D I Z E.” Combining the 
ringing of bells and electronic 
elements 
with 
an 
acoustic 

guitar juxtaposes the sounds 
that Léon works to incorporate 
throughout 
the 
album. 

“Strangerz” slows things down 
and allows Léon to showcase 
her vocals. It’s a response to the 
opening “Bipolar” that spoke 
about heartbreak and betrayal. 
“Strangerz” reminisces on first 
encounters and young love as 
she sings, “We were strangers / 
‘Til we became one heart.”

4 4 doesn’t just appease 

Léon’s 
existing 
fans 
— 
it 

pushes her into mainstream 
listening. As she steadily gains 
popularity, Léon will soon 
reach more people than anyone 
thought possible.

COMMUNITY CULTURE NOTEBOOK

On almost every road trip I’ve 

taken with my dad, whether it 
was a 20 minute drive to a soc-
cer game, or a ten-hour trip from 
Ann Arbor to Philly, I can always 
recall listening to Bob Dylan’s 
greatest hits. The six-set edition 
sat on the floor of my dad’s CRV, 
always an arms length away. 
Without looking, my dad would 
deliberately tell me which CD to 
put in and which track to play, as 
if he memorized the set list. The 
moment the pluck of Dylan’s gui-
tar rung the speakers of the CRV, 
my dad would be singing along.

I would sit in the passenger 

seat, staring out the window, lis-
tening to Dylan sing the words to 
“It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleed-
ing)” and “Subterranean Home-
sick Blues.” Quite frankly, I never 
thought much of it. 

“Now this is the original rap 

… not like that rap crap your gen-
eration listens to now,” my hip-
pie father would tell me with a 
chuckle. I knew his words were 
earnest. I questioned how this 
white dude from the ’60s could 
be considered a “rapper,” but the 
words of love, advocacy, protest 
and peace rattled in the car, and 
I was genuinely intrigued by 
Dylan’s music.

Little did I know, this “white 

dude from the ’60s” would be 
the first ever songwriter to win 
the Nobel Prize for Literature in 
2016.

If I had only known how influ-

ential Dylan would be in both the 
music world and the literature 
world, I would have paid more 
attention during the makeshift 
studio sessions in our CRV. But 
with Dylan winning this award 

and, of course, me being more 
mature, I could not help but go 
back and genuinely listen to his 
lyrics.

Recently, I sat on the floor of 

my best friend’s bedroom. Noah 
played “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m 
Only Bleeding)” on his speaker 
 
— a song I have not heard since 
I was riding in the car with my 
dad. The nostalgic words became 
meditative as Noah and I sat 
there in silence. We listened to 
Dylan preach an introduction in 
his rough singing voice:

Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child’s 

balloon

Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too 

soon

There is no sense in trying.
These lyrics might not reso-

nate with everyone. However, 
from a writer’s perspective, these 
words sunk into my ears as if I 
were at a poetry reading. They 
lingered, 
provoking 
intuitive 

thought, meaning and feeling.

Since the announcement of the 

award, I have been listening to 
Dylan on repeat, not just because 
I enjoy his sound, but also 
because I hear his lyrics as prose. 
I think of those car rides with my 
dad and how insignificant they 
felt at the time. But now, as an 

aspiring writer and an avid music 
listener, Dylan’s style has begun 
to shape the way I see the cross 
pollination of musical lyrics and 
literature.

Regardless of my dad’s notion 

that Dylan is a rapper, there is 
no doubt in my mind that Dylan 
is a writer. Yet, I question: If his 
lyrics can be considered a prema-
ture style of rap, then can we con-
clude that rap is a form of poetry? 
And does this apply to all forms of 
rap, meaning that rap is a form of 
literature?

Maybe that theory is a stretch, 

but looking at Dylan through 
this lens opens up a brand new 
outlook on musical lyrics. Early 
folk artists like Simon & Garfun-
kel or Woody Guthrie created 
music that might also be seen as 
some style of prose storytelling, 
but where does that leave con-
temporary musical artists?

The argument with my dad 

over rap could continue, with me 
telling him that there are actu-
ally great rappers and artists 
nowadays including some of my 
favorites: J. Cole, Frank Ocean 
and Kanye West. But the genera-
tion gap between my dad’s music 
era and mine will probably never 
unite.

The real answer here lies 

within how we define literature 
and whether or not musical lyr-
ics, despite the genre, can be 
defined as literature. At the end 
of the day, my dad and I could 
definitely put Dylan as an early 
marker for original poetic com-
position, even if he wasn’t a rap-
per. But what I have found most 
profound are the barriers that 
Dylan broke, the controversy 
that will reside with his Nobel 
Prize and the outlook on future 
awards for literature and song-
writing.

The Getup Vintage offers apparel from many decades.

Getup and find a costume

State Street vintage store is the perfect haunt for Halloween

Walking into The Getup Vin-

tage was like shifting through 
all the hustle-and-bustle of State 
Street and finding an unexpected 
diamond; exposed brick walls 
adorned with various pieces of 
art encased a homey space, with 
bright lines of the racks of vibrant 
clothing shining out like a beacon. 
The Getup Vintage is a beautiful 
cacophony of timeless designs. 
Like the clothing it sells, this shop 
is both modern and vintage: well-
worn, framed paintings stand next 
to exquisitely vibrant hand-paint-
ed designs on the walls which, 

in turn, stand next to a chic and 
sophisticated sitting area. Like the 
clothing it sells, this shop has his-
tory.

“Initially, this store was started 

12 years ago. A woman named 
Kelly ran it for the first ten years… 
it started upstairs, actually, on the 
third floor, in the attic space. About 
six years ago, she fought with the 
landlord and got it moved down-
stairs,” Kaylan Mitchell said.

Mitchell, along with her part-

ner Lindsey Leyland, are the cur-
rent owners of The Getup Vintage. 
They had both been employees 
working for the previous owner 
when, a couple years ago, opportu-
nity struck.

“She 
[the 
previous 
owner] 

decided she wanted to retire about 
two, three years ago. Myself and 
my partner Lindsey were both 
working here and she was just like, 
‘You gals wanna keep it going?’ and 
we were like ‘Yeah, duh!’”

Mitchell’s excitement and pas-

sion for the store comes through 
in her words, in her bright smile 
as she explains the store’s history 
and especially through the actual 
store itself; even though the lay-
out is an eclectic conglomeration 
of clothing pieces with varying 
patterns, colors and styles, every 
object is placed with care and pur-
posefulness. Different groups of 
clothing are meticulously labeled 
in curling font while various pieces 
of jewelry arranged in a pleasing 
composition bedazzle the register. 
However, the arrangement of the 
store wasn’t always as it is today. 
When management traded hands 
to Mitchell and Leyland, they 
decided a complete makeover was 
in order.

“Since we took it over, we reno-

vated,” Mitchell said, “we kind of 
put our own spin on things because 
it was a totally different vibe.”

Before Mitchell and Leyland 

took over, The Getup Vintage was 
more centered on antiques that 
you had to dig for in order to find 
what you desired. While quarrying 
for buried treasure can be enter-
taining, Mitchell decided she had 
a new vision for the shop: one that 
focused on a perfect melding of 
past and present.

“I wanted to have clothing that 

people like you and me would want 
to wear,” Mitchell said, “things 
from the past that are trendy and 
affordable … a lot of designers take 
directly from vintage clothing. It’s 
like, okay, what colors are hot this 
season? Oh, that’s all 1970s.”

Her vision is apparent: through-

out the store, retro jeans hold their 
own next to racks of beautiful vin-
tage swing dresses while shoes of

all different time periods look on 
from the sidelines. The only thing 
these varying styles and articles 
of clothing have in common is that 
they all are something you could 
wear today, casually walking down 
the street.

Mitchell 
and 
Leyland 
also 

decided to physically change the 
arrangement of the store itself 
once they achieved ownership.

As Mitchell said, “There’s noth-

ing left from before (except the 
jewelry case).” 

It’s a beautiful room; one that 

radiates 
cordiality, 
openness 

and comfort through the layer of 
authenticity that covers the entire 
store like a warm blanket. The 
flowery designs etched over parts 
of the walls were all done by hand, 
courtesy of Mitchell and Leyland, 
and the arrangement of the vari-
ous enduringly eccentric decora-
tions seemed to have a great deal 
of thought behind the placements. 
In fact, it is this persistent sense of 

pride and enthusiasm that causes 
the store to feel so welcoming; you 
may not know exactly what you 
want to buy, but as soon as you step 
into The Getup Vintage you know 
you’re going to find it there.

Which is what makes the shop 

so perfect for Halloween costume 
shopping.

“Either you can come in with 

an idea, ‘Oh, I want to be Daphne 
from Scooby Doo,’ and we can 
pull pieces that have that kind of a 
vibe. Or what’s kind of also really 
fun is just to come in here and 
look at what we have and see what 
inspires you,” Mitchell said.

The best part about costume 

shopping at The Getup Vintage is 
the fact that you are able to rework 
pieces of your costume into daily 
wardrobe essentials instead of 
shoving them to the back of the 
closet to collect dust; the pieces 
that this store offers are extremely 
versatile. How could they not be? 
The foundation of The Getup Vin-

tage is built on recycling the old 
into the new and on reusing past 
favorites for current ensembles.

The store does get busier around 

Halloween every single year, with 
people rushing in the last few days 
before the 31st to try and find the 
perfect costume. Rather than let 
the sudden influx of customers 
under a time-crunch stress her out, 
Mitchell seems to have fun with it.

“It’s [helping people out with 

their costumes] one of my favor-
ite things because it’s like a hunt,” 
Mitchell said.

She narrated a story of a man 

who wanted to embody Prince for 
Halloween. A monumental task 
that ended in a success, Mitchell 
found him a purple jumpsuit with 
leather fringe that came straight 
out of the 1980s. It was a classic 
Halloween tale: a costume fit for a 
prince, picked with care from the 
depths of a cozy vintage clothing 
store that treats its customers a lot 
like family. 

With autumn swiftly descend-

ing and the hibernation of nature 
at hand, new and exciting music 
is awakening at the 
annual 
Edgefest 

Festival, hosted by 
Kerrytown Concert 
House. The avant-
garde jazz festival, 
now in its 20th year, 
kicked off on Tues-
day and will contin-
ue to run through 
Saturday, showcas-
ing diverse and dar-
ing 
performances 

by a variety of art-
ists, many of them 
University of Michigan alumni and 
faculty, including Stephen Rush.

“It’s so fun that it’s damn goofy,” 

Rush said on the composition he 
will be performing at Edgefest 
with the University of Michigan 
Jazz Ensemble. “I’m okay with 
that; it’d be better for the audience 
to have fun than be miserable, 
right?”

Rush, who is a professor of 

performance arts technology at 
the School of Music, Theatre & 
Dance, has been a participant in 
Edgefest throughout much of its 
existence.

“I’ve been playing with Edge-

fest for — oh, man, for a long 
time, for a long, long time,” Rush 
said. “It may be 20 years ago I put 
together a version of Miles Davis’s 
“Bitches Brew” with one of my 
classes, actually.”

Rush 
has 
additionally 

performed at Edgefest throughout 
the years with other groups 
and in other styles, including a 
performance with his New York 
based trio Yuganaut with Roscoe 
Mitchell, and a performance 
of avant-garde composer John 
Cage’s “Sonatas and Interludes” 
for prepared piano.

The piece of Rush’s being 

performed Saturday, which was 
commissioned by Edgefest a few 
years ago, is called “Jazz Piano 
Concerto with Graphic Score 
Interludes.” Like much of his work, 
it is eclectic and adventurous. 
The piece includes sections in 
styles taken from throughout the 
history of jazz and classical music, 
and dispersed throughout are 
graphic score interludes, sections 
of music that are improvised off 
of paintings created by Rush. The 
entire composition is a unique 
mishmash of disparate threads.

“My aesthetic, I think, probably 

is mostly informed by Hitchcock, 
because Hitchcock’s movies … are 
really sexy, and they’re always a 
little bit funny, and they’re defi-
nitely creepy,” Rush said. “And I 

just think, ‘Man, that’s a good rea-
son to pay attention,’ you know? 
It’s not this bullshit where back-in-
the-day you go into Blockbusters, 
and you go ‘well there’s a comedy, 
well there’s a romantic, now this is 

a horror film,’ you 
know, 
everything 

is really compart-
mentalized, 
and 

you know exactly 
what it is … and I 
think 
that’s 
just 

such a drag, man … 
it’s like if you look at 
Matisse’s paintings, 
he has this dark, 
weird, violence, and 
then cute and pret-
ty and flowers, and 
you just go ‘what?’ ”

Rush also addressed many of 

the preconceived notions he finds 
people hold about music, saying 
he attempts to dismantle them 
through his work.

“[My main aim with my music 

is] not necessarily self-expression, 
which is what people seem to think 
music is about,” Rush said.

“You know, different pieces 

for me have different functions 
— there’s some pieces that actu-
ally do try to express things, but 
I think, just looking at this piece 
specifically, it’s kind of a peda-
gogical gift, because I wanted the 
students to be able to play music in 
all these different styles. I just love 
the breadth and scope of jazz. And 
also it’s a statement against people 
who don’t dig that.

“There are so many folks who 

just go, ‘Oh, well, I’m going to be 
responsible for the music between 
1955 and 1963,’ you know, and I just 
think that’s pathetic. In order to be 
a complete jazz musician, I think, 
you should at least have a strong 
familiarity of the whole breadth 
and scope of it.”

Along those same lines of 

broadening interests, Rush works 
in many different mediums and 
styles, exploring new possibilities 
and constantly reinventing the 
sort of work he does.

“I’m an artist who chooses 

artistic outcomes based on proj-
ects, not so much on my own 
identity as an artist … what I’m 
more interested in is the process 
of what’s happening when I make 
stuff, and being really honest 
about that. I’m interested in being 
honest about where I want to be 
with that particular artwork.”

For “Jazz Piano Concerto with 

Graphic Score Interludes,” Rush 
said he ultimately created a piece 
entirely distinct from his initial 
ideas.

“The pieces ended up being very 

different from what I’d planned 
on,” Rush said. “And that’s the 
funnest part about making things, 

right? You kind of sequester your-
self into a room and say ‘I’m going 
to make something,’ and you come 
out and go, ‘Wow, I didn’t think 
that was going to happen!’ ”

Rush’s process is one of constant 

exploration, following his instincts 
and refusing to be bound by any 
sort of careerism or preconceived 
notions of what music is about or 
for.

“In the old days you’d say ‘wher-

ever the spirit leads,’ … that’s the 
idea of it, letting yourself go down 
the weird path, the extremely 
weird path.”

As a professor, Rush also instills 

this outlook in his students. For 
example, early next month one of 
his classes will be constructing a 
piece to be performed on the pond 
near the Earl V. Moore building.

“This year is crazy, they’ve 

got a floating greenhouse on the 
pond, it’s just really out there,” 
Rush said. “And then somebody 
like risk management says ‘Well, 
we’re going to have to ask you what 
you’re going to do out there,’ and 
it’s like, ‘I don’t know, dude. It’s not 
done yet, man, how do I know?’ ”

Rush’s outlook as a composer and 

artist goes beyond his exploration, 
and is informed by a desire to touch 
people meaningfully.

“I’ve got an Air India barf bag 

in my studio, and it says … ‘if 40 
percent of the audience needs this, 
then it’s your problem,’ ” Rush said.

“And what I propose to do when 

I write a piece of music or when I 
perform is I really hope that people 
are engaged on some kind of deep 
level. I’m not trying to prove 
anything, I’m not trying to make 
any major artistic statement, nor 
am I in any way trying to put myself 
in this position of superiority where 
they need to struggle to get what 
I’m getting. Not that everything 
I do is ridiculously accessible — 
that’d be the last that I’d ever say … 
I definitely like it when audiences 
are confused and then they figure 
stuff out. I do get really worried if 
they don’t figure it out, you know, 
like if something’s really funny and 
I don’t hear audiences laughing, 
you know, a little kitten inside me 
dies, man. I just go ‘damn, what 
did I do wrong?’ ”

Rush’s hope is that, despite 

the unorthodox nature of his 
work, that audiences will after 
a short while understand what 
he is trying to say and receive 
something personally important 
from the experience.

“There’s some things that I do, 

definitely, that I think are initially 
extremely confounding and off-
putting,” Rush said. “And yet, I’m 
hoping that I hit that sweet spot 
where … the audiences goes, ‘Ah, 
okay, alright,’ and they don’t feel 
like I’m being mean to them.”
