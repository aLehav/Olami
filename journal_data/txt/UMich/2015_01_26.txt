University

in study on

ADMINISTRATION

Twenty-eight 

institutions plan 
survey to analyze 

sexual assault

By MICHAEL SUGERMAN

Daily News Editor

In addition to developing a 

University-centric sexual assault 
survey, which will be randomly 
distributed to a pool of 3,000 stu-
dents, the University is teaming up 
with the Association of American 
Universities to conduct a uniform 
sexual assault survey across 28 col-
lege campuses.

The AAU is comprised of 62 top 

research universities in the United 
States and Canada. Twenty-seven 
of the participating schools, includ-
ing the University, are members of 
the AAU; Dartmouth College will 
also distribute the survey.

University 
President 
Mark 

Schlissel said the AAU survey, 
which is set to launch this April, 
will be campus-wide, and added 

that it will supplement the Univer-
sity’s data.

“I figured that it would be valu-

able to have us be able to compare 
our data to that at a lot of differ-
ent schools that are similar, big 
research universities, but different 
than us, to see how we’re doing,” 
he said in a January interview with 
The Michigan Daily.

On each campus, the AAU sur-

vey will be identical, apart from 
five school-specific questions per-
taining to resources for reporting 
and addressing sexual assault.

Westat, a global research firm, 

has been contracted to facilitate 
and assess the survey results, 
which the AAU plans to publically 
report upon completion. Experts 
from both Westat and participat-
ing universities are still putting the 
survey together based on standards 
set forth by the White House Task 
Force to Protect Students from 
Sexual Assault.

“Our primary purpose in con-

ducting this survey is to help our 
institutions gain a better under-
standing of this complex problem

“The Red Express” 

features styles 

from cities in seven 

countries

By MAYA SHANKAR

Daily Staff Reporter

Models sporting clothing from 

around the world hit the runway 
Saturday night for EnspiRED’s 

charity fashion show.

EnspiRED, a student orga-

nization that aims to promote 
artistic expression at the Univer-
sity, brought fashions from seven 
cities to the Biomedical Science 
Research Building for their ninth 
annual showcase.

Featuring clothing designed 

by students and donated from 
local and Detroit-based bou-
tiques, the show displayed styles 
from the cities Moscow, Tokyo, 
Rio de Janeiro, London, Mum-

bai and Detroit, as well as Accra, 
Ghana.

EnspiRED President Cyrus 

Tetteh, an LSA senior, said the 
event’s schedule was designed to 
simulate a train on a track, refer-
enced by this year’s theme, “The 
Red Express.” The train symbol 
is meant to represent travel-
ing to the seven different cities 
throughout the fashion show, he 
said.

Tetteh said EnspiRED is an 

advocate of the arts on campus 

and in the community. This year, 
the organization plans to donate 
20 percent of the event’s profits to 
Arts & Scraps, a nonprofit organi-
zation that repurposes recycled 
material to create arts and crafts 
projects for elementary school 
students in Detroit.

University alum Chukwudi 

Nwamba, who graduated in 
December, volunteered to model 
in the annual show for her second 
time.

Valery Gergiev 
draws criticism 
from Ukrainians 

for support of Putin

By AMRUTHA SIVAKUMAR

Daily Arts Writer

As 
the 
University 
Musi-

cal Society prepared to award 
Mariinsky Orchestra Conductor 
Valery Gergiev with the presti-
gious University Musical Soci-
ety Distinguished Artist Award 
on Saturday at Hill Auditorium, 
Ukrainian protesters and anti-
Russia advocates collected on 
the steps outside in a die-in pro-
test.

Standing in solidarity with 

those 
affected 
by 
Russian 

aggressions, 
the 
protesters 

aimed to raise awareness among 
the concert’s attendees about 
Gergiev’s support of Russia’s 
annexation of Crimea earlier this 
year. Ann Arbor resident Eugene 
Bondarenko, one of the leading 
organizers of the demonstration, 
said the group was also protest-

ing UMS for granting Gergiev 
the award.

Returning to Ann Arbor for 

his 12th and 13th concert con-
ducting the Russian Mariinsky 
Orchestra with UMS, Gergiev 
is most well known for direct-
ing the Mariinsky Theatre for 
over 30 years. Recently, how-
ever, Gergiev has been criticized 
internationally for his outspoken 
support of Russian President 
Vladimir Putin’s anti-LGBTQ 
policies and antagonism against 
Ukraine.

“We think it’s quite hypo-

critical that he would say that 
at home and then come here 
and make money. You can’t have 
both,” Bondarenko said. “We 
also like to let people know that 
next time they buy tickets for 
something like this, UMS does 
not have the best discretion for 
who it invites.

“UMS has a great responsibil-

ity to have an ethical litmus test,” 
he added. “When you have an 
odious figure, you should really 
think about if you’re really inter-
ested in inviting them.”

Fighting

through 

personal narrative was one of 
the main themes at the South 

Asian Awareness Network con-
ference held over the weekend.

Parents, 
alumni, 
college 

and high school students from 
around the country gathered in 
both Rackham Auditorium and 
the Michigan League to partic-
ipate in the two-day event.

Titled “Threads: Connect-

ed over 300 attendees during 
its run from Friday night to 
Saturday afternoon. SAAN first 

launched the conference 13 
years ago to foster discussion 
on social justice issues relevant 
to the South Asian community, 
such as Islamaphobia after 
9/11. Since then, the event has 
evolved to address a broader 
spectrum of issues, such as 
mental health.

Doors are now 
open Saturdays 
every other week

BY LINDSEY SCULLEN

Daily Staff Reporter

The lights were dimmed in 

Mighty Good Coffee, a small café 
in downtown Ann Arbor. Lit can-
dles lined the tables, and bassist 
Lenny Swanson — Mighty Good 
Coffee’s wholesale and general 
manager — led a house band 
through a few jazz standards. 
Interestingly enough, as cus-
tomer chatter buzzed around the 
shop, coffee wasn’t the drink of 
choice.

For the third time, Mighty 

Good Coffee moonlighted as 
the Brillig Dry Bar on Saturday 
night, opening its doors to the 
public and ushering in crowds of 
people looking to drink without 
getting drunk.

The opening marked the bar’s 

official commitment to operating 
every other week, though owner 

Nic Sims said Brillig will likely 
welcome customers on a more 
regular basis in coming months.

“It’s a fun and lively place for 

people who are looking for a 
night on the town without all of 
the trappings that come along 

with an alcoholic bar — the noise 
levels, the TVs and the alcohol,” 
Sims said. “I mean it’s really just 
about an alcohol-free, fun place 
to hang out.”

Sims is part of the alcohol-

recovery community, as are 
many of her patrons. With the 
dry bar, she said, she is providing 
others with a fun way to “over-
come their demons.”

Brillig serves non-alcoholic 

classics, like a Brooklyn Egg 
Cream, and alternatives to tra-
ditionally alcoholic beverages, 
like its Vernors Orange Sour. 
The bar’s drink menu changes to 
include seasonal fruits and fla-
vors — for example, Sims recent-
ly switched from a cranberry 
sour to the orange.

For sake of reference, a “whis-

key sour” typically involves 
whiskey, lemon juice and sugar; 
the Vernors Orange Sour entails 
fresh orange juice and “sour 
sauce,” which consists of cider 
vinegar, fresh ginger and powder 
ginger.

Sims’ husband David Myers 

owns Mighty Good Coffee. He 
and Sims conceptualized Brillig 
during Thanksgiving this year — 
they wanted to find a way to use 
the shop after coffee-drinking 
hours had ended.

Sims said in total, the conver-

sation that catapulted Brillig Dry 

Bar into existence lasted 15 min-
utes.

“I came up with the name, I 

sketched out a logo, we made a 
plan for what we would serve 
and then we decided that we 
would test it,” Sims said.

The bar’s name, “Brillig,” 

comes from one of Sims’ favorite 
poems — “Jabberwocky” from 
Lewis Carroll’s “Through the 
Looking Glass.”

“The poem has a lot of mean-

ing to me as a person,” she said. 
“I relate it to recovery in that 
everybody has a jabberwocky 
or a demon or something that 
they’re trying to deal with.”

“ ‘Brillig’ appears in the first 

line of the poem. It means ‘the 
time of day when you switch 
from daytime to evening cook-
ing.’ ”

The bar opened for the first 

time Dec. 5, coinciding with Ann 
Arbor’s “Midnight Madness,” a 
night of holiday sales, caroling 
and shopping.

Sims said about 250 to 300 

people passed through the dry 
bar that opening night, initiating 
it as a hot spot for people around 
Ann Arbor and beyond.

The next pop-up opening 

came Dec. 29. Bartender Eric 
Monaghan said the result was 
similar — all sorts of people 
showed up, some from as far 

away as Toledo, Ohio.

Monaghan added that the bar 

has attracted two demographic 
groups in particular: pregnant 
women and Muslims, both of 
which are known not to drink 
alcoholic beverages.

“It’s been very interesting — 

the different crowds that we’ve 
attracted,” 
Monaghan 
said. 

“We’ve gotten a lot of students, 
which I found surprising at first.”

Monaghan said because Ann 

Arbor is known for its non-dry 
nightlife, it was a bit of a won-
der that so many students have 
shown up to Brillig.

LSA sophomore Maddy Moog 

was one of the students at Brillig 
on Saturday night.

“One thing I really liked about 

it was that it was like a judge-free 
zone,” Moog said. “It was a great 
way to go out with friends and 
not feel like you had any pressure 
on you to consume alcohol.”

However, to Sims, the fact that 

students are drawn to Brillig is a 
particular type of success, a solu-
tion to a question she had long 
been trying answer.

“How can I provide an alterna-

tive to the myth that recreation 
requires alcohol consumption?” 
Sims asked. “How can I make 
teens understand that it’s not a 
right of passage to grow up, to be 
drunk?”

She said she wanted to show 

young people that they could go 
out to a bar-like environment and 
have fun without getting drunk. 
This message is particularly 
important to Sims because she 
and her husband have two teen-
age children, one 16 and one 17.

In addition to the family and 

baristas from Mighty Good Cof-
fee, several of Sims’ friends also 
wanted to be a part of the Brillig 
project and work dry bar events.

“It always feels like we’re just 

having a big party at the café,” 
Sims said.

As of now, Sims’ party drink 

of choice is the Brooklyn Egg 
Cream — being from Brooklyn 
herself, it makes her “nostalgic 
and happy and feel good.”

The Brooklyn Egg Cream is 

also one of Monaghan’s favorites.

“It almost makes you feel like 

you’re a kid, it’s like a choco-
late soda,” Monaghan said. “It’s 
been one of our most consistent 
drinks. It’s really nice and sweet 
and a lot of people really like it.”

Sims said each step she takes 

with Brillig is a baby step toward 
expanding the community’s idea 
of nightlife culture. Now, she is 
beginning to consult with other 
businesses interested in mirror-
ing her business model and has 
trademarked some of the dry 
bar’s drinks.

“This is my heart and soul and 

guts, everywhere,” she said.

Students protest research

CHANMEE CHUNG/Daily

Engineering junior Daniel Lee and Engineering senior Kristina Kim

Auditorium at Stamps Auditorium Saturday. 

DISNEY DUET

Almost 30 students pro-

tested 
defense 
research 

by marching to then-Vice 
President 
Charles 
Over-

berger’s office. The stu-
dents wore “U-M military 
research kills” T-shirts and 
demanded that Overberger 
come to a public forum and 
explain why the University 
is increasing its amount of 
military research.

Overberger, 
the 
vice 

president of research, was 
believed by some student 
groups to have a final say on 
what research was conduct-
ed at the University.

“Your decision is final on 

what research goes on,” said 
LSA senior Ken Naffziger. 

“Whether it is research with 
killing or not.”

Overberger said a forum 

organized by the Research 
Policies Committee would 
be helpful.

11 years ago this week 

(Jan. 28, 2004)

University 
students 

received e-mails infected 
with the MyDoom virus, 
which spread through email 
and peer-to-peer file sharing 
programs.

Bruce Burrell, a computer 

anti-virus team leader for 
Virus Busters, a division of 
the University’s Information 
Technology Center Servic-
es, said the virus became a 

problem because the updat-
ed virus definitions that pre-
vent the virus from reaching 
students were unavailable 
when the virus attacked.

“The bottom line is, if 

you get an attachment from 
someone, you never open it,” 
he said. “You contact that 
person and ask, ‘Did you 
send me something?’ ”

A $250,000 reward was 

offered by a Utah-based 
UNIX system supporting 
and 
consulting 
company 

called the SCO Group, for 
information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of 
those who created the virus.

“As a model, you get to show-

case the designer’s art,” Nwam-
ba said. “It’s a fun experience 
because you get to get out of your 
comfort zone. It allows you to 
not only express the designers’ 
art, but also express your own 
art — the way you express the 
fashion.”

The show opened with styles 

from Moscow. As fake snow fell 
on the audience, models walked 
down the runway wearing cold-
weather designs such as fur 
coats and hats. The “train” then 
moved to Tokyo, where mod-
els displayed a “modern” style, 
sporting pantsuits and messen-

ger bags, intended to capture 
the essence of a rapidly growing 
Tokyo fashion industry.

The audience cheered loudly 

when the Detroit scene began. 
Models wore clothing inspired 
by the city and its sports teams.

The final scene, displaying 

fashion from Rio de Janeiro, 
opened with a model walking 
down the runway carrying a live 
snake.

In an e-mail interview, LSA 

senior 
Christopher 
James, 

a member of the EnspiRED 
e-board, said a high-fashion 
show allows for all types of 
flourishes.

“Once the lights come on and 

the music plays, you will for-
get that you’re at a student-run 
show,” James wrote.

comments like “Go home, fascists” 
and “Why aren’t you protesting 
against Obama,” several audience 
members took flyers explaining 
Gergiev’s political stances from 
the protesters and offered to read 
it inside the theatre premises.

Ann Arbor resident Arsenia 

Kozak, an active member of the 
Ukranian cultural community in 
Greater Detroit, said it was hard 
to separate the art from the poli-
tics when Ukrainians were dying 
from the policies that Gergiev 
condoned.

“The arts is beautiful and I’m 

not saying anything against Ger-
giev as a conductor,” she said. 
“Even if (people) go in there and 
listen to his music, I want them to 
be aware of what is happening in 
Ukraine.”

UMS President Ken Fisher said 

the protest was not unique and 
the musical society has seen simi-
lar demonstrations in the past 
when Russian artists have graced 
Hill Auditorium.

“I’m all for freedom of speech, 

and I’m really impressed that 
people that are doing this have 
chosen this vehicle,” he said, com-
mending the protestors for not 
attempting to disrupt the concert. 
“At a university, we need to first of 
all celebrate freedom of speech, 
but also be tolerant of different 
points of view.”

Nevertheless, given the Mari-

insky Orchestra’s 23 year history 
with UMS and the Ann Arbor 
community, 
Fisher 
said 
the 

“extraordinary things” Gergiev 
had achieved artistically deserved 
recognition.

“We made the decision over 

two years ago to honor Valery Ger-
giev and the Mariinsky Orches-
tra,” Fisher explained. “They 
are among the best in the world, 
and we try to separate politics 
from their artistic achievements, 
and also from the contributions 
they’ve made to our community.”

sion with regard to the South 
Asian community at the Univer-
sity and beyond.

“It was kind of an attempt to 

create a space for conversations 
that weren’t being had in the 
South Asian community,” Shetty 
said. “It was kind of a place to 
bring people together and start 
engaging with those issues with 
leaders in our communities.”

This year, “Threads” focused 

on personal stories from various 
members of the South Asian com-
munity, emphasizing the signifi-
cance of individuals’ journeys and 
the relation to their identities.

Public Policy senior Raeesa 

Khan, 
co-director 
of 
SAAN 

and the conference, said the 
“Threads” theme diverged from 
previous iterations of the confer-
ence, which concentrated more 
on business and entrepreneur-
ship. She added that the goal this 
year shifted toward social justice 
and activism.

“We’re trying to show partici-

pants that you can make some sort 
of change, whether that’s change 
at an individual level or a larger 
level within in your field regard-
less of whether you’re a doctor, 
lawyer or artist,” Khan said.

This year’s guests were activ-

ist Almas Haider, comedian Hari 
Kondabolu, actor and writer 
Sunny Tripathy, youth activist 
Saajan Bhakta, pediatric special-
ist Seema Jilani and Mahima 
Mahadevan, who works at the 
Education Policy Initiative at the 
Ford School.

Past SAAN conference speak-

ers 
include 
University 
alum 

Sanjay Gupta, the CNN medical 
correspondent, Pepsi CEO Indra 
Nooyi and actor Kal Penn.

Each of the speakers present-

ed their experiences with South 
Asian identity in a narrative form 
by providing stories and examples 
from their own lives.

Kondabolu, who performed the 

introductory act for “Threads,” 
addressed the importance of 
hosting an event like the SAAN 
conference because he feels that 
many young South Asians follow 
a tunnel vision to their career 

paths, and don’t have enough 
social justice awareness.

“They have their career path 

and some of it’s pressure from 
the parents and some of it’s from 
going to great schools,” Kond-
abolu said. “This isn’t all (South 
Asians), but … I think they forget 
the bigger issues and the context 
that they live in.

“Awareness 
is 
a 
minimal 

requirement to know what’s hap-
pening in the world and perhaps 
do something about it,” he added. 
“Every year I’m always impressed 
by (SAAN), even when I’m not 
invited. It’s not just one token 
event; it’s actually a commitment 
to justice.”

Tripathy, who is an actor and 

writer for a newly developed Fox 
show titled “Keeping Up with the 
Guptas,” said being the victim of a 
hate crime when he was 16 years 
old shaped his personal character 
and his future ambitions.

Tripathy was attacked by a neo-

Nazi gang on the day of his prom 
and was left severely injured, 
with a broken clavicle that still 
protrudes today. Realizing his life 
could end any day, he began to 
work harder at his schooling and 
filmmaking, of which he became 
an avid fan after receiving a cam-
corder to document his sister’s 
childhood.

South Asians have such diverse 

subsections, Tripathy said, that 
that holding a conference like 
SAAN is necessary.

“(The South Asian community) 

needs its own voice,” Tripathy 
said. “It needs its own space and 
I think the more people know 
about our cultures, our ideas, 
our philosophies, they’ll see that 
we’re no different from anybody 
else.”

Bhakta, youth activist and CEO 

of the non-profit PovSolve, shared 
his narrative related to mental 
health — a topic he said is taboo in 
South Asian communities.

Bhakta, who was invited to 

the White House and honored by 
President Barack Obama, detailed 
how his own struggle with men-
tal health, resulting from years of 
emotional abuse, inspired him to 
help his community.

“We’re a community and in 

order to make a difference we 
have to come together as a com-

munity and we have to be able 
to talk about sensitive issues like 
mental health and breaking stig-
mas,” Bhakta said.

Khan, the event co-director, 

said while the speakers were spe-
cial, the subsequent group con-
versations were just as important 
— if not more so.

After each workshop, attendees 

split into small groups to discuss 
what they had heard and share 
their 
individual 
perspectives. 

These groups were comprised of 
12 to 15 randomly selected stu-
dents with two members of SAAN 
trained to help facilitate discus-
sion about potentially sensitive 
and triggering issues.

Throughout the conference, 

members of the “Threads” Cen-
tral Planning Team and small 
group 
facilitators 
continually 

emphasized the importance of a 
safe space for these conversations.

“The strengths of the small 

group is that the conference really 
tries to tap into different commu-
nities on campus and provide a 
space where all those narratives 
can be shared,” Shetty said.

“This is to build trust and to 

build a group of people that you 
become comfortable talking (to) 
about not only these issues, but, 
this year especially, your own per-
sonal narratives,” Khan added.

Two of the small group facilita-

tors, LSA junior Amanda Ruesch 
and LSA sophomore Sidra Kader, 
said the conference left them feel-
ing more challenged about their 
own perceptions of the issues at 
play.

“Facilitating is a (much) dif-

ferent role than participating,” 
Ruesch said “It challenges you 
and it actually makes you think 
a little bit more, just because you 
have to be the one to come up with 
questions to ask.”

Kader was not only a first-time 

facilitator, but also a first-time 
attendant of the conference. She 
said she liked delving deeper into 
the social issues that were pre-
sented at the conference, and felt 
empowered by her facilitator role.

“If I can be in control of this, 

well I can be in control of making 
the change we need to make and 
have improvements in society, 
which is the point of the confer-
ence, is it not?” Kader said.

rect imaging data. When paired 
with other components of the 
NGV project, these advances 
aim to launch the first class of 
driverless vehicles.

Led by Ryan Eustice, associ-

ate professor of engineering, 
and Edwin Olson, associate pro-
fessor of computer science and 
engineering, the NGV project 
has a team of graduate students 
developing vehicle technologies 
like new navigational and obsta-
cle detection systems designed 
to enhance driver safety, reduce 
vehicle production costs and 
ultimately design a self-driving 
car.

Arash Ushani, an engineering 

graduate student, said the NGV 
project will have a long lifespan 
at the University even after it 
accomplishes its target goals.

“It’s like saying, ‘Do you think 

airplanes will be complete once 
you make something that flies?’ 
” Ushani said. “There’s always 
ways you can improve it to make 
it better.”

Ryan Wolcott, an engineer-

ing graduate student, has been 
working on the NGV project’s 
navigational system since 2012. 
The system employs the same 
type of camera technology used 
in video gaming systems to pro-
duce three-dimensional map-
ping data.

“The end goal is for driver 

safety,” Wolcott said, “It’s obvi-
ous that human drivers are not 
very good at driving. You know, 
people have gotten accustomed 
to fatalities with driving just 
because it’s such an important 
piece of technology. Technol-
ogy can fill in the gaps where 
humans are distracted, or what 
have you. It’s ultimately technol-
ogy that the user can then turn 

on.”

However, it will still be a 

while before driverless vehicles 
hit the market, as researchers 
run into obstacles. The naviga-
tion system, for example, has 
trouble adapting to a change in 
weather conditions and is diffi-
cult to implement in natural gas 
vehicles.

The vehicle’s software inde-

pendently deciphers the images 
it collects to make operating 
decisions. The transition from 
laser scanning technology to 
NGV’s camera-based unit is pro-
jected to significantly reduce the 
cost of vehicle navigation sys-
tems, setting their project apart 
from other, higher-cost projects 
that use lasers.

“A lot of the bigger compa-

nies like Google rely on (lasers) 
so heavily,” Wolcott said. “A 
key part of their infrastructure 
is these laser scanners. But it’d 
be nice long term to have the 
cameras as maybe the only sen-
sor because they’re far easier to 
conceal. It will lead to a car that 
looks more attractive.”

Engineering junior Carl Ker-

shaw worked on the NGV proj-
ect as part of the Undergraduate 
Research Opportunity Program.

“We have a few research 

vehicles, but they have to be 
hybrids because of how much 
power the computers draw,” 
he said. “Those cars are very 
expensive because they’re cov-
ered in sensors, basically. You 
try to plug this into a normal 
car, you basically slowly drain 
the battery.”

Ford Motor Company and 

State Farm Insurance sponsor 
the NGV project, in collabora-
tion with April Robotics Labora-
tory. Further NGV testing will 
be conducted at the University’s 
new Mobility Transformation 
Center testing facility, set to 
open this spring.

Evaluating WSN

H

ave you ever heard a song 
that just clicked with you? 
Having some involuntary 

bodily 
response 

to 
the 
chords 

or 
lyrics, 
feel-

ing like you may 
have ascended to 
some other musi-
cal 
realm? 
I’m 

not talking about 
the gagging feel-
ing you might get 
when you hear 
“CoCo” by O.T. 
Genasis, I’m talk-
ing about some-
thing real. For a moment, think 
back to a time when a song gave 
you goosebumps, brought tears to 
your eyes or brought forth the feel-
ing of a rock in your stomach. Band 
songs, musical songs and even pop-
ular songs on your iPod can trig-
ger these responses. I talked with 
Chelsea Zabel, a senior psychology 
major, about some of the songs that 
gave her chills.

Two of the songs were from musi-

cals: “Till We Reach That Day” from 
“Ragtime” and “One Day More” from 
“Les Miserables.” “Ragtime” is about 
three families from different eth-
nic and socioeconomic backgrounds 
in New York City at the turn of the 
20th century, while “Les Miserable” 
is a story following an ex-convict as 
he tries to do good despite tensions 
between the French government and 
people in 19th-century France.

For both, the end of Act I is closed 

by its respective song, one imme-
diately after a war uprising and the 
other after *SPOILER* the death of a 

main character. Tensions have risen 
in both plots, and both songs are 
calls to justice in response to recent 
events. Zabel describes the point in 
the show when you are “pre-invested 
in the storyline,” forming connec-
tions with the plot and the charac-
ters. Each song starts with pain from 
a single voice. But strength begins 
to grow when it starts building with 
other singers.

“It starts when you’re already on 

edge, then it just fills out to where 
you can’t think about anything else 
because there is just so much going 
on,” Zabel said. “You’re just inside of 
the music.”

The point of a good musical is to 

envelop you and transport you to that 
time and that scene. Music is there 
to bridge the connection between 
the audience member and the actors, 
portraying not just the plot, but the 
emotions as well.

Now think about a time when 

you created something amazing. 
Whether you built it at MHacks, in 
a wood shop with your hands, in 
the kitchen or with an instrument, 
you were proud, right? You put in 
the time, effort and elements that 
you knew needed to be a part of the 
final product. I immediately think to 
“Elsa’s Procession to the Cathedral” 
by Richard Wagner. A percussionist 
in high school, I played timpani for 
this song. After months of practice, 
I had not thought much about “Elsa” 
and let it go (pun intended) with the 
other songs to the back of my mind. 
But come concert time, performance 
ready and played with perfection, the 
song immediately caused me tears 
and chills. It was beautiful; we had 

worked so hard to create such a beau-
tiful piece. Building slowly, the pro-
cessional becomes more robust with 
emotion and volume. Even listening 
to it as I write this, I am taken back to 
that exact concert.

How about popular songs? You may 

have heard it a thousand times on the 
radio when it was nauseatingly repeat-
ed, or some oldie but goodie when 
iTunes was on shuffle. But was there a 
time when it meant something differ-
ent? Zabel remembers a time in sixth 
grade when the song “The Middle” 
came on by Jimmy Eat World. As she 
had heard it before, this song spoke 
to the (then) insecure, middle-school 
Chelsea. Making her cry, she said she 
felt relieved because “the song was 
telling me ‘… everything was going to 
be alright, alright. Doin’ better on your 
own, so don’t buy in.’ Oh my gosh, it’s 
speaking to me!”

Those days when certain songs 

don’t just go from one earbud to the 
other, but actually sit in your brain 
and make you think and react; those 
are the days when you actually hear 
the lyrics.

So here’s what you do now. Go to 

YouTube and listen to these songs, 
think about how you’re feeling while 
listening to it. Listen to the songs a 
couple times if you have to, see how 
your body and mind respond. If you 
remember a song that caused some 
involuntary response in you, I want 
to know! Whether it is a T-Swift song 
or some piece you played in middle-
school jazz band, one day it might arise 
and spark some reaction inside of you.

Visceral reactions

SARA
SHAMASKIN

I 

have an interest in mental health care, 
in both definitions of the word “inter-
est.” I find the topic interesting to read 

about and discuss, and as a 
person suffering from men-
tal illness, it is in my best 
interest for these services 
to be available, affordable 
and transparent. As news 
began to trickle out about 
Wolverine Support Net-
work, a system of stu-
dent-run 
mental 
health 

support 
groups, 
my 
curiosity 

was peaked.

WSN is an initiative of 

Central Student Government (something in 
which I certainly do not have an interest) and 
was one of the major proposals outlined dur-
ing last spring’s student elections. The idea of 
student-led support groups came from CSG 
President Bobby Dishell, who had seen simi-
lar initiatives played out at high schools and 
smaller colleges. WSN launched on Jan. 22, 
and soon groups of 10 to 12 students will begin 
weekly meetings.

As the program slowly unveiled itself, I was 

deeply skeptical. Some students I spoke with 
expressed a lack of confidence in these groups, 
fearing that the issues faced by marginalized 
students would be misunderstood or dis-
missed by their peers. My chief concern was, 
and still is, the concept of loosely trained stu-
dents acting as group leaders, especially if this 
could result in attention and resources moving 
away from professional clinicians.

To further complicate the matter, WSN has 

been strongly endorsed by Counseling and 
Psychological Services, a University service 
with a mixed track record. CAPS has served 
thousands of students this year alone, but it’s 
also the place that — for me and many others 
— told us an initial appointment would be two 
weeks away and a follow-up would take anoth-
er two weeks. I’ve had good and bad experi-
ences at CAPS, and have heard the same from 
numerous peers. As the vital campus center for 
mental health, “half good, half bad” appeared 
to me as closer to failure than success.

A discussion with Dr. Todd Sevig, director 

of CAPS, helped me begin to see WSN (and 
CAPS) in a different light. Sevig, who has 
spent 25 years at the University, called the idea 
of a peer support network “the best thing since 
sliced bread.”

Explaining his feelings, Sevig framed WSN 

as a point of entry, perhaps for a student who 
will use clinical therapy down the road, or as 
the first and only interaction another student 
will need to build better coping skills.

“We try to approach ‘mental health, mental 

illness’ as really resting on a continuum, where, 
really, in some sense of the word or definition, 
all 43,000 students could use help and support 
around mental health,” Sevig explained. “For 
some students, it will be easier to talk to a peer 
than one of us as a good first step.”

Sevig made a good point, and I was remind-

ed that my condition and personal preferences 
lay on a very different part of this continuum 

than most students. As for those awful wait 
times, during the Fall 2013 semester, students 
waited 10 days on average between coming in 
and seeing someone at CAPS. During the Fall 
2014 semester, under a new initial appoint-
ment system, student wait times fell to an aver-
age of 3.7 days — and this is with an 18 percent 
increase in the number of students coming in 
and asking for help.

CSG President Bobby Dishell and WSN 

student leader Nick Raja both echoed many 
of Sevig’s points, describing peer support 
groups as having a lower barrier for students 
to get help. This is a lower barrier than going 
to CAPS, but also a lower barrier to something 
that may be even more difficult for some stu-
dents, like telling their parents.

“It’s an entry point for someone who 

didn’t grow up with a therapist in their home 
town, and its an entry point for someone who 
took a semester off to do inpatient,” Dishell 
explained. “For some people, it’ll be a supple-
ment. For other people, it’ll be all they need.”

Dishell also assured me, “We’re not 

training therapists.”

Raja, who will be leading a student group 

with at least one other leader, spoke similar-
ly, saying, “It’s not therapy, it’s for everyone.” 
He further explained that the leader’s role is 
to facilitate, not to be a counselor, and that a 
large part of WSN leader training was under-
standing how to recommend students for more 
comprehensive treatment.

Dishell, though humble about the net-

work’s goals in helping individual students, 
has made it no secret that WSN has ambi-
tious aims, saying, “In five years, hopefully 
less, it’ll just be something that you do. It’ll be 
engrained in the culture.”

Raja, who wrote an op-ed earlier this 

fall promoting WSN, mentioned the idea of 
“changing campus culture,” a promise that 
seems to be made by countless student groups 
every semester.

I discussed with Sevig how lately, cam-

pus culture has been changing in the 
 

wrong direction.

“Every year, it seems, that the pressure to be 

the Leaders and the Best has gotten higher and 
higher and higher — and that has some conse-
quences,” Sevig said.

One of the biggest consequences, Sevig 

explained, is “a sense of ‘I can’t fail; I can’t 
even do average work.’ ”

On a campus built with the purpose of educa-

tion, students are instead faced with a perfec-
tionist mentality that stifles learning and fuels 
anxiety. This is a culture that all of us are famil-
iar with, and one that doesn’t appear to be going 
away anytime soon.

For now, I’ll cling to some of my skepticism 

about WSN, at least in the big picture. However, 
student leaders backing WSN are going in the 
right direction, as is CAPS under Sevig’s lead-
ership. Hopefully some of this work really will 
“change campus culture” — in that, I would 
 

certainly find quite a high level of interest.

The cycle

JAMES
BRENNAN

A

t the request of those interviewed, all 
identities in this piece have been writ-
ten with pseudonyms.

Emit — a white man in his 

middle 30s — has been living 
on the streets in Ann Arbor 
since his release from a county 
prison, where he served a sev-
en-year stint for an armed rob-
bery conviction. He received 
parole and was expected upon 
his release to rejoin a society of 
which he had never truly been 
 

a member.

“They told me I could go 

to therapy,” Emit said of the 
options made available to him 
by the county. “They did give me a place. But (the 
transition) wasn’t easy.”

Emit was set up in an apartment and was eligi-

ble to become employed through a prisoner reen-
try program. For Emit, however, it didn’t feel like 
a new start, but rather a mere change of scenery.

Emit was outfitted with an electronic tether, 

confined to travel only between his apartment 
and his workplace. Traveling outside of these 
bounds would have been a violation of his 
parole and would have landed him back in pris-
on. After a period of time — alone day after day 
without friends or family in the state — Emit 
felt as if he had never left his prison cell.

“You know what they say: if you put a rat in a 

cage, he drives himself insane,” he said.

The emotional stress and the depression that 

festered with each passing day of his release 
started to get to Emit, especially once he began 
to realize that the wages he had been earning at 

his entry-level job weren’t even enough to cover 
rent for the apartment he had been given.

When Emit tried appealing to his land-

lord, he was told that he would be evicted if 
he couldn’t make the rent payments on time. 
And as a felon with “a real jacked-up criminal 
record,” even prior to his most recent felony 
incarceration, the prospect of an additional job 
was bleak; Emit found himself in a downward 
cycle that he didn’t know how to break. Accord-
ing to research done by the Population Studies 
Center, this is a struggle typical for parolees.

“I quit the job, acting irrational. All of a sud-

den, I had no job, no place. So what am I gonna 
do?” Emit recalled asking himself.

His solution: a return to the transient life on 

the streets he had lived since leaving his home-
town in Maine as a teen.

Not able to leave the state as a condition of 

his parole, Emit chose to settle in amongst the 
homeless population in Ann Arbor. According 
to a 2013 census, 3,000 to 4,000 individuals are 
living without homes in Washtenaw County, a 
number which doubled in the years between 
2011 and 2013.

Emit — shortly after quitting his job — joined 

their ranks. After doing so, he noticed a huge 
difference between his reality on the streets in 
Ann Arbor and his experiences with homeless-
ness in other cities across the nation; the com-
munity in Ann Arbor — both those with and 
without homes — was something unique.

In comparison to neighboring Ypsilanti — a 

city with a median household income almost 
$20,000 lower than that of Ann Arbor, accord-
ing to statistics from 2012 — Emit said he’s able 
to get more sympathy from both passersby and 

AUSTIN
DAVIS

police in Ann Arbor. Relative to other 
cities, he’s treated with some norma-
tive level of respect here.

“It’s peaceful … although there’s a 

ton of competition, you can still get 
by,” he said.

He also noticed solidarity amongst 

other members of the homeless popu-
lation in Ann Arbor, a community that 
congregates in designated, clandestine 
spots around the city center. They help 
each other out with places to find food 
and shelter. “Anything you need,” Emit 
said, “someone will tell you where it’s 
at usually.”

I didn’t want to seem patronizing, 

like I was just a curious kid coming 
up and asking his life story at no per-
sonal benefit to him. So I bought him 
a cup of coffee and kicked it with him 
for a bit longer. He joked with me 
at times, describing his preference 
for the bizarre — his preference for 
 

unrestrained freedom.

“ ‘Bizarre’ is one of the excitements 

of life; it’s like a way to experience life. 
It keeps things interesting. It’s the 
randomness. It’s the new experiences. 
You can find everything these days, 
but still random bullshit happens. It’s 
an adventure.”

I considered that, and had to admit 

that I agreed; spontaneity, random-
ness and serendipity are nouns I’d like 
to use to describe my life as well.

But as my hands began to grow 

numb from dictating our conversation, 
I realized that perhaps this was a jus-
tification for Emit, a way to lighten his 
mental burden by assuring himself that 
there are some redeeming aspects to his 
situation. The bags underneath his eyes, 
and his hands, calloused and dirty from 
exposure, contradicted this sentiment.

So too did his future goals.
“It’s time to do something and get 

going,” Emit told me. “Get a job, a 
place, community college, a better job 
and civilization.”

The concept of ‘civilization’ came 

up frequently during our conversa-
tion. After a while it dawned on me: 
despite the humor, intelligence and 
civility with which I’d come to know 
Emit over the course of our conver-
sation, he classified himself as one 
outside of society.

And really, he is. But not for want 

 of reentry.

Emit had to leave to catch a bus to 

meet his parole officer. I left our con-
versation wondering if employers in 
this city — whose community Emit 
felt treated him with respect — would 
respect a parolee enough to give him 
another shot.

TRAVON JEFFERSON| MICHIGAN IN COLOR

What’s up? Ya’ll good? Yes my dear 

reader, this is an educational article 
despite the few sentences you will 
catch of a different dialect: Black 
English Vernacular (BEV) to be 
exact. I apologize for any headaches 
or bottomless confusion I may cause 
in advance to any “Standard English” 
or “Strict Grammar” readers that 
may stumble across this article. Don’t 
let the confusion of this dialect deter 
you, let it motivate you to learn it and 
become “articulate.” You may come 
across words that looked misspelled 
but certainly, in BEV, these words 
are spelled phonetically correct. For 
instance the word “mouth,” phoneti-
cally speaking, BEV speakers replace 
the Θ sound, which pronounces the 
“th” sound in “mouth” and instead 
use “f” so the word will actually 
be spelled “mouf” that’s basic BEV 
phonology 101 for ya’. All the con-
tractions, the twangish vocabulary 
words that I type up, or any other 
complex Black English grammar that 
I may lose the reader in, my bad. So, if 
you can tolerate my unbearable black 
syntax, stick around and you just may 
learn something!

Growing up in a heavily African 

American/Black American populated 
area, I got the dialect I’m so proud 
to call my own. My BEV is so deeply 
rooted inside my heart that it’s clear 
where I come from the moment I 
speak. Detroit, Michigan, raised on 
the east side to be exact. All my life, I 
was corrected for the way I talked. I 
had to be extremely careful, to make 
sure I pronounce every word with 
clarity and don’t I dare incorporate 
those BEV grammar rules or gov-
erning syntax. Of course, I only had 
to monitor my speaking in school, 
because I wanna sound intelligent 
and I want the teacher to see that I am 
intelligent. My whole thing is, do I not 
 

sound intelligent?

Just because I speak with this 

minority dialect, does that really make 

me stupid? Nah I ain’t stupid, clearly 
the President Barack Obama has the 
same vernacular I do. If anything, my 
BEV is what’s up because it shows that 
I’m multi-dialectical. Yep, I can switch 
between speaking Black, and then 
switch to speaking what people call 
“Standard English.”

So my next question, my dear 

audience, do you know anybody that 
speaks with a BEV dialect? Were they 
speaking clear English but you just 
couldn’t grasp why, for some reason, 
they decided to put that habitual “be” 
in the place of an adverb such as usu-
ally? Did I lose you? Don’t worry, I 
have examples for days: Have you ever 
heard someone say, “She be eating a 
lot?” Or, for more of a direct college 
experience, “He be studying?” Do you 
be confused? I hope so. ‘Cause, now 
that you’re confused, I can pull you 
out of that confusion pit and teach you 
a thing or two. I can teach you some-
thing that linguists have been trying to 
educate people on for years.

Black English Vernacular is not 

stupid, it’s not a dysfunctional piece 
of English, and it’s a dialect that has 
developed a complex system of rules 
and syntax. Seriously, can you really 
say something is dumb or not right 
when it has a full-blown system, 
which if not followed carefully will 
make the speaker sound outright 
wrong and garner the confused looks 
of every natural BEV speaker? For 
instance, if a non-BEV speaker tries 
to use the habitual “be,” they would 
probably say something such as, “He is 
studying,” which makes no sense BEV 
syntax-wise. In Standard English and 
non-BEV, speakers will use the verb 
“to be” correctly, but BEV natives have 
a different way of saying it. For quick 
and easy BEV speakers, we use that 
good ol’ BEV syntax and drop that “to 
be” verb “is” and turn that into a habit-
ual “be” and you have “he be study-
ing.” The beauty that comes with the 
habitual “be” is that it does not have 

no specific time frame. Standard Eng-
lish speakers would hear “Travon be 
studying,” and think that I’m off some-
where studying at that very moment. 
According to BEV natives I could be 
studying now, later, or sometime last 
week, just know I be studying.

My dear readers, BEV is a great dia-

lect where you must possess the cor-
rect rules to speak it, but you need to 
have that slur/paused way of speaking, 
the nice little twang that compliments 
it. Ms. Jamila Lyiscott explained a per-
fect rule in her TED Talk “3 ways to 
speak English” (haven’t heard of her? 
Please educate yourself now) when she 
said her mother mocked BEV saying, 
“Y’all be madd going to the store” and 
Ms. Lyiscot instantly corrected her in 
response saying, “never does madd 
go before a present participle.” This 
is in fact true. Now, you’re thinking 
that mad is an emotion, actually mad 
turned into an adverb that modifies 
adjectives or verbs, for example “that 
was mad cool yo.” Don’t worry my 
dear readers, I won’t delve deep into 
the various vocabulary terms and the 
way how their definitions switch in 
accordance to the syntax of BEV.

My point is, however, next time 

you see that friend/classmate/person 
speaking with a twang and mixing 
up that “Standard English” syntax 
and turning it into another perfect 
English dialect known as BEV, don’t 
downplay their intelligence. PLEASE 
don’t ask them to steady repeat them-
selves, and whatever you do, don’t try 
and imitate the way they mouf’s form 
and shape them words because trust 
and believe, if you don’t sound right 
you will get the straightest, coldest 
and blankest stare of your life. Cause 
guess what, BEV gotta complex sys-
tem of syntax, that to speak it prop-
erly and be able to code-switch into 
“Standard English” makes you what 
me and Jamila like to call articulate.

Björk’s strange, 
dark ‘Vulnicura’

ONE LITTLE INDIAN

Don’t push her in, she’ll short circuit.

Björk’s new album 

is a challenging 
avant-garde work

 

By AMELIA ZAK

Daily Music Editor

There’s an episode of Friends 

where Ross reawakens a per-
sonal piano “sound” he acquired 
in college. He 
wants 
each 

song 
to 
be 

understood as 
a 
“wordless 

sound 
poem,” 

made complete 
by 
helicopter 

sounds, 
door-

bells, jackham-
mer 
noises 

and dog barks. 
The rest of the 
“Friends” cast neglects to inform 
him of these floundering artis-
tic attempts. When listening to 
Björk’s newest album, Vulnicura, 
I felt like Ross. Any attempt I 
would make at recreating the 
sounds of Vulnicura would be 
equally as awkward and ridicu-
lous. I could never reproduce 
these sounds — I couldn’t even 
sing them in the shower — and 
I can barely apprehend the Ice-
landic depth or enjoyment that 
some could find in Vulnicura.

The album floats around the 

marriage of three musical ele-
ments: Björk’s specific throaty 
and moaning voice, a recurring 
string section and the impos-
sibly cool additions of revered 
electronic artists like Matthew 
Herbert and Haxan Cloak. In 
the past, Björk’s albums fol-
lowed 
outlandish 
themes 

(her last revolved around her 
thoughts and opinions of the 
growing universe), but here 
Björk has never been more vul-
nerable. It’s as if she opened up 
her diary and began to sing its 
contents aloud. Her voice cries 
over every track, explaining her 
marriage’s decline and the disin-
tegration of her once whole fam-
ily. The album is a dam breaking 
that held back waters of Björk’s 
nervous depression.

Fogged by a high school 

obsession with Björk’s 1993 
single, “Big Time Sensuality,” I 
imagined I was qualified enough 
to conquer the album.

I was deeply mistaken.
This type of experimental 

music surpasses other modern 
bands of the same genre, like St. 
Vincent and tUnE-yArDs, in its 
depth and ability to be under-
stood by the everyday listener. 
Unqualified to properly review 
this kind of avant-garde art, I 
received the album as a fasci-
nated third party. So here’s my 
song-by-song, 
minute-by-min-

ute transcribed listening session 
of the album. If you have the 
album, or are skilled in the fine 
art of “finding free shit on the 
Internet,” jump in with me:

The 
album 
begins 
with 

“Stonemilker.” With a strong 
cello and string section begin-
ning, I am surprised from the 
start. Her emotional, hiccup-
ing voice enters in slowly, drag-
ging you into a series of pleads 
to a lover she’s losing. “Show 
me 
emotional 
respect,” 
she 

whispers. Deep bass vibrations 
emerge and the speakers in my 
room start to shake. I imagine 

Björk shaking as much as my 
bedside table as she coughs the 
question “What is it that I have 
that makes me feel your pain?” 
Lying on the ground, listening 
along, I’m starting to become 
more and more aware of my 
emotional and musical short-
comings that do not permit my 
critical analysis of this album.

Next song, “Lionsong” — a 

personal favorite of mine. With 
absolutely 
no 
consistencies 

other than the string section 
that follows along, it feels like 
your buckled into a rollercoaster 
of Björk’s crippling heart. That 
sounds dramatic, but just go take 
a listen. “Maybe he will come 
out of this loving me?” — ouch.

“History of Touches” digs 

deeper into an electronic sound. 
A synthesized piano and heavy 
electronic base guides the song 
with each sound vibrating off 
her voice. The song drags itself 
out of the emotional and into 
the physical, recalling “every 
single fuck we had together in 
a wondrous time lapse.” At only 
three minutes long, this is pos-
sibly the most digestable song 
on the album.

“Black Lake” is a 10-min-

ute adventure of the mind that 
made me wish I had cannabis 
on hand. The album is starting 
to become sonically repetitive: 
here’s 
another 
string-based 

song layered over by a string of 
electronic creations. With each 
new verse the song builds with 
pounds and rolls of strings. If 
you can’t survive the entire 
track, just try and make it to the 
song’s apex, lasting from the 
fourth to the fifth minute. From 
there until the completion of the 
song you are trudging through 
the emotional sludge of the 
Black Lake with Björk. Bring 
some weed, and good luck.

Following “Black Lake,” I 

went to “Family” looking for an 
emotional and musical respite. 
Instead I found another out-
landish and dark creation with 
(surprise!) strings, electronics 
and Björk’s depictions of her 
newly created vat of human sad-
ness that could easily be slipped 
into the film score of “Alien.” 
The largest distinction to be 
found in “Family” is Björk’s 
malleable vocals as it occupies 
an almost witch-like persona. 
Minute three arrived, a strong 
cello appears, and any ebb and 
flow I thought I had begun to 
understand disappears imme-
diately.

“Notget” follows the theme 

of the album. More strings, 
more cries of sadness, more 
really cool electronics. “Our 
love could not keep us safe 
from death”, “Without love I 
feel the abyss and understand 
your fear of death” are some 
of the throaty proclamations. 
This repetition has my sympa-
thies dissipating quickly.

A respite! Finally! “Atom 

Dance” is the waltz of this 
album. I was surprised (but 
with all this weird nothing 
really surprised me at this 
point) by this unique dance 
number; it is the closest the 
album 
comes 
to 
the 
hap-

pier songs — and apparently 
times — that Bjork once gave 
in ’90s albums like Post and 
Debut. It was here that I played 
“Big Time Sensuality” just to 
remind myself that Björk has 
known happier times. And 

maybe she’ll find happiness 
again soon? You poor woman. 
My poor confused roommates.

“Mouth Mantra” contains 

some of the most impressive 
electronic work on the album. 
At six minutes long I’m expect-
ing to be bored by the repeti-
tion of sonic themes (strings, 
electronics, 
Björk’s 
vocals) 

but here I was pleasantly sur-
prised.

It’s pretty late, and I’m pret-

ty exhausted, but this song has 
me envisioning myself ventur-
ing through outer-space with 
Björk as she sings to me about 
sacrifice. This isn’t entirely 
unpleasant.

And finally, the light at the 

end of the deep dark tunnel of 
this album: “Quicksand” arrives 
with electronic spasms. Slow 
strings emerge once again, but 
at only two minutes long and 
with a change of topic — Björk’s 
words finally start describe 
a hope for rebirth — the song 
grips your ears until its finish. 
One of the album’s last lines 
says, “when she is broken she 
is whole and when she is whole 
she is broken.” This album 
would, and probably should, 
end in a confusing, insightful 
paradox.

Jack Sparrow would kick this guy’s ass.
Depp sinks deeper 
in dull ‘Mortdecai’ 

By VANESSA WONG

Daily Arts Writer

Certain tropes reappear in 

cinema so frequently that we 
might as well consider them 
laws of nature. 
Serious actors 
+ empowering 
real life story 
= Oscar. Seth 
Rogan + fart 
jokes = com-
edy. These are 
simplistic and 
well-trodden 
concepts, but they work.

“Mortdecai” takes a stab at 

its own genre specific equation, 
picking English Dandy off the 
cinematic shelves and tossing it 
in the medley with Internation-
al Heist and Frivolous Antics. 
And we can’t forget the mus-
taches. Because those are hip 
and funny, right?

Not always, kids.
The eponymous protagonist 

Charles 
Mortdecai 
(Johnny 

Depp, “Pirates of the Caribbe-
an”), a well-groomed and per-
petually 
featherbrained 
art 

dealer, gets tangled up in a 
scheme to recover a lost Goya 
painting. Not only is the paint-

ing a masterpiece, it also sup-
posedly 
contains 
Hermann 

Goering’s 
lucrative 
bank 

account details. Clearly, many 
people are after this painting, 
but Mortdecai must get his 
hands on it first. Illegal at times, 
this caper takes Mortdecai dan-
gerously close to Russian thugs, 
nymphomaniac daughters and 
fellow art rivals. All this while 
an MI6 agent cozies up to Mort-
decai’s beautiful wife (Gwyn-
eth Paltrow, “Shakespeare in 
Love”) and cracks in the mar-
riage emerge.

“Mortdecai” 
flounders 

because its foundational com-
ponents 
are 
too 
iconic 
to 

rebrand under another name. 
It’s too easy to tease out the 
film’s inspirations. It touches on 
Wes Anderson kitsch through a 
“Pink Panther”-style slapstick 
comedy lens. In fact, Mortdecai 
seems like a direct synthesis of 
Jacques Clousseau and Gustave 
H. Its storyline also evokes that 
of the “Grand Budapest Hotel,” 
which 
is 
painfully 
obvious 

considering that “Grand Buda-
pest” was released less than a 
year ago. In this film, the equa-
tion that originally arose from 
pure receptivity now becomes 

a sophomoric crutch to borrow 
from already successful prede-
cessors.

Mortdecai himself, the sup-

posed heartbeat of the film, 
isn’t as powerful of a char-
acter as he needs to be. His 
charm can’t support his arro-
gance, nor does his debonair 
background contrast sharply 
enough with his clumsiness. 
There’s also the added issue 
that the audience must stom-
ach Depp and Paltrow’s grat-
ingly awful English accents for 
two whole hours. The entire 
film revolves around Mortde-
cai’s eccentricities, and though 
everything seems to align, he 
fails to lock it all together, as it 
falls flat in the end. It’s disap-
pointing to see Depp, a power-
house actor, bumbling around 
in a role like this.

If the audience can over-

look the film’s many hurdles, 
we’re rewarded with at least a 
few decently funny gags. After 
all, it does stick to the tried-
and-true formula, and maybe 
mustaches really can invoke 
laughter. But it still can’t can-
cel out the gravity of “Mortde-
cai” ’s biggest sin: it just tried 
way, way too hard.

Sherm’s intricate 
‘Unbecoming’

University alumnus 

releases debut 
mystery novel

By CAROLYN DARR

Daily Arts Writer

“The first lie Grace had told 

Hanna was her name. ‘Bonjour, 
je m’appelle Julie,’ Grace had 
said. She’d been in Paris for 
only a month and her French 
was still new and stiff. She’d 
chosen the name Julie because 
it was sweet and easy on the 
French tongue — much more so 
than Grace was. The best lies 
were the simplest and made the 
most sense, in the mind and in 
the mouth. These lies were the 
easiest to swallow.”

Thus 
begins 
Rebecca 

Scherm’s debut novel “Unbe-
coming,” and from there the 
reader 
must 
follow 
Grace 

through all the lies as her past 
is slowly revealed.

We are first introduced to 

Grace, or Julie, in Paris, as a 
young 
American 
expatriate 

scraping out a living restoring 
antiques at Zanzu et Filles. The 
only time she allows herself to 
think about her past is for a few 
minutes each night when she 
anxiously checks the Albemar-
le Record, the only newspaper 
in her small home town of Gar-
land, Tennesse. Through the 
lens of an a former classmate’s 
reporting, she has followed the 
arrest and subsequent incar-
ceration of Riley and Alls, the 
love of her life and his best 
friend.

Throughout 
the 
novel 

Scherm takes her readers back 
and forth between Grace’s 

impoverished present in Paris 
and her idyllic past in Garland, 
where she met and fell in love 
with Riley Graham in sixth 
grade. She quickly became part 
of the Graham family, with a 
room made up especially for 
her in the attic and Mrs. Gra-
ham becoming a beautiful and 
elegant surrogate mother. The 
Grahams 
were 
everything 

Grace’s family wasn’t and she 
quickly became accustomed 
to the love she found in their 
inner fold. Now, Riley and his 
friend Alls are getting out of 
prison and the truth is that the 
fault for their convication lies 
with Grace. Now she can never 
come home or have any contact 
with anyone from her past, liv-
ing with the constant fear that 
her history will catch up with 
her.

Scherm intricately arrang-

es her story, sanding off each 
layer to reveal a different com-
plication underneath, much as 

Grace painstakingly restores 
the antique James Mont box 
she finds in a Paris flea mar-
ket. As both a classic romance 
and a scintillating mystery, 
“Unbecoming” keeps readers 
engrossed through a multi-
tude of twists and surprises. 
Grace herself is an extremely 
multilayered character, a self-
proclaimed liar that the reader 
knows is untrustworthy from 
the beginning. Yet, even as 
more of her is revealed and her 
good-girl veneer disintegrates, 
Grace manages to hold your 
interest, if only to find out if 
she gets what is coming to her.

Sam Smith’s soulful 
songs at Masonic 

By GIBSON JOHNS

Daily Arts Writer

There was one point during 

his Thursday show in Detroit 
during 
which 
Sam 
Smith 

seemed like he might actually 
still be lonely. After all, he had 
announced his recent break-up 
at a show in Toronto just two 
days earlier. He was singing the 
tender album cut “Good Thing” 
and had everyone in the audi-
ence wondering if the song’s 
lyrics (“Too much of a good 
thing, won’t be good for long / 
Although you made my heart 
sing, to stay with you would be 
wrong”) had almost become too 
real, considering his presum-
ably still-open wounds.

But, as the song came to 

a close and the audience’s 
screaming reached new heights, 
Smith couldn’t help but flash 
his signature 100-watt smile. 
It’s impossible to be lonely with 
that much enthusiastic, unre-
lenting support.

Smith’s rise to the top ech-

elons of pop music has been 
meteoric. After he performed 
on “Saturday Night Live” last 
March, he has had a string of 
hits of his own (“Stay With 
Me,” “I’m Not The Only One”) 
that capitalized on the success 
of a couple of high-profile fea-
tures 
(Disclosure’s 
“Latch,” 

Naughty Boy’s “La La La”). He 
played to a sold-out crowd at 
Madison Square Garden earlier 
this month, which is unheard 
of for an artist that was virtu-
ally unknown less than a year 
ago. In February, he’s up for 
six Grammy awards, including 
Best New Artist, which he’ll 
almost surely win.

Last May, I saw Sam Smith 

perform in Amsterdam, Neth-
erlands to a packed house in 

a venue about a third of the 
size of the Detroit Masonic 
Temple. Though the splendor 
and natural range of his voice 
was shocking in a way that 
hadn’t been apparent through 
my iPod’s earbuds, there was 
something missing from his 
physical presence. For all the 
ways that his voice filled the 
room — it was truly something 
I had never experienced before 
in my entire life — his demean-
or was remarkably lacking and 
timid. He didn’t move around 
much on stage, and he avoided 
interaction with the audience.

On Thursday, things could 

not have been more different. 
In just over half a year, Smith 
had turned what had been a 
major flaw in his potential into 
a quality that has been instru-
mental to his success. Between 
songs 
he 
was 
endearingly 

bashful. 
His 
high-pitched, 

self-assured 
speaking 
voice 

had everyone in the audience 
— doe-eyed little girls, tipsy 
mothers, adoring college stu-
dents, stoic elderly couples — 
reeled-in and swooning over 
his every word.

Throughout his 16-song set, 

Smith was at the top of his game. 
Dressed in black and white, he 
effortlessly went from the low-
est of lows (the desperate plead-
ing of “Leave Your Lover” and 
the heartbreaking accusations 
of “I’m Not The Only One”) to 
the highest of highs (the unwav-
ering confidence of “Money On 
My Mind” and the revengeful 
scorn of “Like I Can”) with-
out ever showing any signs of 
burnout after his busy last 12 
months. He danced in sync with 
his backup singers, encouraged 
crowd engagement and willing-
ly narrated the stories behind 
his songs.

The 
emotional 
high-point 

of the night came during his 
three-song encore. “I refused to 
end my album on a sad note,” he 
said. “I wanted this next song 
to be a love letter to my future 
boyfriend, whoever he may be.”

He then started “Make It To 

Me” a capella, sitting side-by-
side with his backup singers. 
The moment was memorable 
in its brutal, no-fuss honesty 
that paired brilliantly with the 
song’s hopeful lyrics. It proved 
that Smith is an open book 
when it comes to his music. He 
may not share the most inti-
mate details of his life when he 
speaks, but it’s OK. His silence 
is made irrelevant by his lyrics.

Sam Smith is, admittedly, not 

lonely anymore. He’s content 
with where he is in life because, 
even though he may not have 
found someone to fall in love 
with yet, if the line of adoring 
fans that lined up around the 
block three hours before his 
show proved anything, there 
are millions of people around 
the world that have fallen in 
love with him.

And that’s company enough 

for one of the world’s biggest 
pop stars.

Michigan comeback 

falls short in 

overtime vs. sixth-

ranked Badgers

By JAKE LOURIM

Managing Sports Editor

On the first possession of the game 

Saturday, the Michigan men’s basket-
ball team forced the shot clock all the 
way down, hoping No. 6 Wisconsin 
would force up a tough shot. Instead, 
point guard Bronson Koenig beat 
sophomore guard Derrick Walton 
Jr. to the rim for an easy layup at the 
buzzer.

That theme persisted for most 

of the evening: No matter what 
the Wolverines tried, it seemed 
they could never make Wisconsin 
uncomfortable for long enough to 
seize control.

Two hours later, the Badgers felt 

uncomfortable — headed to over-
time, on the road, on a Saturday 
night, in front of a sellout crowd — 
and it was none other than Walton 
who did it.

With 1.3 seconds left, after Michi-

gan (5-3 Big Ten, 12-8 overall) had 
fought back from three different sig-
nificant deficits, Walton drained a 
3-pointer from the left wing to tie the 
game and send it to overtime.

But when play resumed, Wis-

consin (6-1, 18-2) quickly gave the 
Wolverines had another deficit to 
overcome. And this one was too 
much.

“I don’t think we’re at a stage 

where, unless we’re on fire and hit-
ting every shot, … that we can expect 
to be ahead a lot in games,” said 
Michigan coach John Beilein. “We’re 
going to have to come from behind 
and just stay solid.”

Frank 
Kaminsky 
opened 
the 

extra possession with a three-point 
play after a blocking foul on Michi-
gan freshman forward Ricky Doyle, 
and Wisconsin’s Josh Gasser added 
a 3-pointer on the next possession. 
Kaminsky’s basket put the Badgers 
ahead for good, and he finished with 
22 points and nine rebounds.

“Let’s face it: He’s one of the best 

players in the country,” Ryan said. 
“I don’t say that very often. … Frank 
means a lot to this team.”

The Wolverines fought back to 

within four with two minutes left, 
but gave up an offensive rebound 
before getting the ball back on a 
charge with under a minute to go.

Then, Michigan looked to Walton 

again, but the Badgers denied him 
and iced the game at the line to hold 
on for a 69-64 victory at Crisler Cen-
ter.

“We knew going into this game 

that it was going to be a dogfight, 
that it wasn’t going to be easy,” said 
sophomore forward Zak Irvin. “We 
wanted to go get this one, especially 
in front of the great atmosphere we 
had today. We thought we executed 
the game plan really well when we 
took them to overtime.”

Down by four with under two 

minutes left, Walton and Irvin each 
missed 3-pointers, extending the 
team’s late scoring drought to two 
minutes. Gasser also missed with a 
minute to go, and Michigan again 
had a chance to draw within one pos-
session.

Koenig split a pair of free throws 

with 20.4 seconds on the clock, giv-
ing Michigan another chance down 
three. Walton calmly sank two foul 
shots to draw the Wolverines within 
one and set up his late triple.

For a time, it looked as though

ohn Beilein started 
his morning in Crisler 
Center’s north tunnel, 

telling 
Austin Hatch 
that he was 
“going to do 
just fine.”

As the pair 

was prepped 
to appear live 
on ESPN’s 
College 
Gameday, 
the 1,000 or 
so Michigan 
students who spent their 
Saturday morning representing 
their school on television 
chanted Hatch’s name.

As ESPN previewed a feature 

about the freshman guard’s 

life story on the video board, 
its subject sat beneath. As the 
film rolled, showing the two 
plane crashes that took the lives 
of Hatch’s mother, siblings, 
father and stepmother, Beilein 
wiped away tears. He placed a 
reassuring hand on Hatch’s leg 
as GameDay continued through 
audio of 911 calls and images of 
mangled propeller planes.

The guests and hosts talked 

about Hatch’s recovery and 
what it meant for him to play 
for Michigan. The video board 
played the highlight of Hatch’s 
first point at Crisler Center, 
a free throw in an exhibition 
game against Wayne State on 
Nov. 10.

asked Hatch about his 
relationship with Beilein, 
the man who honored his 
scholarship knowing full well 
he might never contribute on 
the court. Hatch didn’t mince 
words.

“Obviously, he’s a great 

coach,” he said. “But I would say 
he’s 10 times the man that he is a 
basketball coach.”

Saturday morning, John 

Beilein the man was on full 
display. Saturday night, it was 
John Beilein the coach’s turn. He 
didn’t disappoint.

In his eighth year at 

Michigan, Beilein has become 
a fan of the mix-and-match 
lineup, especially in light of 
junior guard Caris LeVert’s 
season-ending injury. He can 
use both of his point guards at 
once. He can play the hot hand. 
He can go big, or he can go 
small.

He can even use the players 

nobody expects him to use. 
Sometimes he’ll even do it in 
the first half of one of the most 
important games of the season, 
because he wants to send a 
message.

“I want to make a point,” 

Beilein said. “I think it’s really 
good for our team and for 
chemistry for those guys who 
work so hard to see playing time. 
Even if it’s short.”

Sophomore guard Andrew 

Dakich had never played a 
meaningful minute for Michigan 
before Tuesday’s 54-50 win over 
Rutgers. Sophomore forward 
Sean Lonergan’s career high in 
scoring is two points.

That didn’t stop either from 

appearing on ESPN in the first 
half of a back-and-forth clash 
against the No. 6 team in the 
country.

“I want to get them in there,” 

Beilein said. “Those two guys are 
so respected by their peers and 
everybody wants them to do so 
well, it could be a catalyst for us 
in some games.”

Hatch’s presence and his 

energy are catalysts in and of 
themselves. But Hatch, of course, 

isn’t nearly ready to see the 
floor against Wisconsin. For the 
time being, that doesn’t seem to 
bother him or Beilein.

“I’m a part of a miracle right 

now,” Beilein said of Hatch, his 
career, his very presence on 
planet Earth.

Beilein’s 

role in that 
miracle is 
made obvious 
by his tears, 
his sighs, his 
reassuring 
squeeze of 
Hatch’s arm. 
And the 
reason he 
played a role 
in that miracle is evidenced 
by his confidence in a pair of 
players in whom he has been 
given little objective, in-game 
reason to be confident.

Andrew Dakich and Sean 

Lonergan were on the floor with 
the game tied against Bo Ryan’s 
juggernaut Wisconsin team. And 
that says everything about John 
Beilein, the man who has stuck 
with Hatch every step of the 
way and the coach who believes 
as steadfastly as anybody in the 
world that hard work, effort 
and sheer desire deserve to be 
rewarded.

John Beilein the man and 

John Beilein the coach are 
obviously not separate entities.

Both of them have the 

unlikely trio of Ricky Doyle, 
Mark Donnal and Max Bielfeldt 
containing Wisconsin’s Frank 

Kaminsky, one of the country’s 
premier big men, for 45 minutes. 
Both of them sat alone at a 
table until they were sure there 
wasn’t an NBA draft selection 
to accept on Jordan Morgan’s 
behalf. Both trusted Derrick 
Walton Jr. with the improbable 

game-tying 
3-point shot 
that sent 
Saturday’s 
game to 
overtime.

With LeVert 

gone, the 
man and the 
coach might 
be reaching 
a limit. One 

has to keep an inexperienced 
group of teenagers emotionally 
intact as they face the pressure 
of living up to consecutive 
Final Four and Elite Eight 
appearances. The other has to 
coax as much production as he 
possibly can out of the same 
group.

Beilein has proved time 

and time again the two aren’t 
mutually exclusive. He wore 
both hats Saturday, and he wore 
them well. In Austin Hatch, in 
Andrew Dakich and in Derrick 
Walton Jr., everything that is 
good about Michigan basketball 
was on full display.

Five-point loss aside, you can’t 

ask for much more.

A quiz on the state of 
Michigan athletics

I 

have a midterm in a class 
already next week, and 
sorry mom, but I have yet to 

study. Maybe it’s because I’m a 
Communication Studies major, 
but I haven’t 
exactly had 
a ton of 
practice with 
this whole 
exam thing.

Perhaps 

I could use 
Michigan 
athletics to 
help with 
“studying,” 
though. With so much going on 
around the world of Michigan 
sports, sometimes it’s hard to 
keep track of everything.

The answer key is at the bottom, 
and there can be more than one 
right answer.

a comeback would be unlikely. 
Four minutes into the second half, 
Wisconsin forward Sam Dekker 
had punctuated an 11-0 run with 
a dunk from halfway to the free-
throw line, and the upset was all 
but off the table. Back on its heels, 
facing an 11-point deficit, Michi-
gan clawed back again.

But Wisconsin called timeout 

and calmed down quickly, string-
ing together a Dekker jumper, a 
stop and an open corner 3-pointer 
by Gasser to go up by five.

That deficit still stood with five 

minutes left, when Irvin dialed up 
another 3-pointer to trim it to two. 
In the last five minutes, it was just 
a matter of who would flinch first.

In the first few minutes, it 

appeared the answer would be 
Michigan. With ESPN’s College 
GameDay in town, 3,000 students 

packed Crisler Center up to the 
rafters before the game, ready to 
erupt. They didn’t get the chance 
initially, as the Wolverines fell 
behind 9-2 before tying the game 
at 21.

After Donnal hit a fadeaway 

jumper from the baseline to give 
Michigan what would be its last 
lead of the game, Wisconsin for-
ward Nigel Hayes stepped in. 
He converted a three-point play 
on the ensuing possession, and 
Dekker followed with a thun-
derous dunk, plus a foul. Finally, 
Hayes drained a 3-pointer with 
one second left in the half, and for 
all of the Wolverines’ effort, they 
trailed by seven. It wouldn’t be 
the last time, but the final deficit 
stuck, erasing progress from three 
thrilling comebacks.

“We don’t believe in moral 

victories,” Irvin said. “This one 
definitely hurts. We just gotta go 
back to the drawing board and get 
ready for Nebraska on Tuesday.”

Behind Enemy Lines: 
Illinois coach Matt Bollant

By MINH DOAN

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
women’s 

basketball team is back in its nest.

After a narrow loss at No. 

20 
Iowa 
on 
Thursday, 
the 

Wolverines return home to an 
arena 
in 

which they 
have 
lost 

only 
once 

this season.

Senior 

forward 
Cyesha 
Goree was her usual self Thursday 
night, racking up 26 points and 13 
rebounds. But she didn’t get much 
help from Michigan’s arsenal 
of 3-point shooters, who went a 
combined 5-for-21 on the night. 
The Wolverines will also need 
senior guard Shannon Smith to 
contribute more than just the two 
points she put up in Iowa City.

On the other side of the court, 

Illinois is looking to snap a four-
game losing streak after losses to 
No. 7 Maryland, No. 16 Nebraska, 
Northwestern 
and 
Michigan 

State.

Freshman 
center 
Chatrice 

White leads the Fighting Illini in 
scoring with 14.4 points per game 
and is second on the team with 42 
rebounds. She’s not afraid to take 
a shot or two from the behind the 
arc either, as she is 7-for-18 on 
3-pointers.

But Illinois, which starts three 

underclassmen and a first-year 
transfer, has been plagued with 
turnover problems, and they 
were made evident in its latest 
loss to Northwestern in which 
the Fighting Illini turned the ball 
over 24 times.

The Daily sat down with 

Illinois coach Matt Bollant at 
Big Ten Media Day in October 
to discuss the upcoming season, 
recruiting, the Big Ten and 
his coaching experience in the 

Philippines.

The Michigan Daily: Last 

year was sort of a down year for 
you. What are the expectations 
going into this season?

Matt Bollant: Expectations 

will be much improved from 
last year. We added a lot more 
talent this season with seven new 
players. Five of them are going 
to play, and two or three of them 
might be our best players, so it’s 
exciting to think about. Kyley 
Simmons might be one of the 
best point guards in the country, 
Chatrice White is as good as any 
freshman in the conference and 
Brittany Carter will be a really 
good ‘2’ guard, so we added some 
pieces that should make us better.

TMD: You talked a lot about 

recruiting and how you like 
going on long recruiting trips in 
your press conference. Is there a 
certain reason for that?

MB: We have 112 days to 

recruit, and you only have so 
many times you can recruit a 
player. I’m definitely passionate 
about recruiting, and I don’t mind 
being on the road and driving to 
show some kids that we really 
want them. We want to make 
them feel wanted. When a head 
coach drives eight hours to see 
a player, it means something to 
the players, and it should and our 
staff is willing to do that.

TMD: What’s your outlook 

on the Big Ten with Maryland 
and Rutgers coming into the 
conference?

MB: It’s exciting for the 

league. The year before I came 
into the league at Green Bay, we 
went 7-0 against the Big Ten, but 
the league was ranked No. 5 in 
the country. Last couple years, 
the league has been No. 1 or No. 
2 and now you add Maryland and 
Rutgers, two great teams. There 
isn’t a league top to bottom that is 
better than the Big Ten.

TMD: I know you coached in 

the Philippines. What was that 
experience like?

MB: 
My 
brother 
was 
a 

missionary in the Philippines 
and Nepal, and I was there for 
six months and coached a team, 
Deeper Life Academy, and it was 
really my first experience as a 
head coach. The first game, we 
got beat by 30 points by the best 
team in the league, and we played 
them in the last game of the year 
and said ‘Let’s see where we get 
to.’ I didn’t think we could beat 
that team, but I kept saying ‘Let’s 
see how we do.’ We had won all 
of our games to that point, and 
were one win away from being 
the conference champion, and 
we knocked the team off that 
day. So it’s pretty special to see 
the change in the team. I thought 
I was going to be a minister and 
stay there for the rest of my life, 
and maybe coach over there, but 
I felt called to stay in the US. But 
I loved the (Filipino), they were 
awesome.

TMD: In terms of talent, it 

probably wasn’t the same as it is 
here, but what made coaching in 
the Philippines so special?

MB: I had two kids, Izzy and 

Muhammad, who just gave me 
everything. They were so excited 
to get better. I remember the first 
day, we had an outdoor court with 
bent rims and one basketball for 
practice, and when they got their 
uniforms, the kids were in tears 
because they had their names 
on the back of their uniform. It 
just made me think how we take 
everything for granted in the U.S. 
These kids were so thankful to 
be a part of the team, and be able 
to play basketball and learn, and 
they wanted to learn everything, 
so it was a great experience for me 
as a head coach. I’ll never forget 
those two kids because they got 
so much better. They hadn’t won 
in the past and now they were 
conference champions.

Huntley highlights 
undefeated weekend

Michigan wrestling 

earns two dual-
meet victories

By BRANDON CARNEY 

Daily Sports Writer

The Michigan wrestling team 

needed to flex its muscles this 
weekend.

Coming off an uninspiring 

performance against Ohio State 
last Sunday, the Wolverines had 
the opportunity to go back over 
.500 in Big Ten duals against 
Wisconsin (7-2 overall, 5-1 Big 
Ten) and Indiana (2-6, 0-5).

No 
one 
showed 
greater 

toughness to get No. 16 Michigan 
(4-3, 3-2) over the hump than 
fifth-year senior Max Huntley. 
He was one of seven Wolverines 
to 
earn 
victories 
in 
their 

matches against Wisconsin, as 
the team went on to defeat the 
17th-ranked Badgers, 24-12.

In addition to his win Friday, 

Huntley earned a 10-3 victory 
in his match against Indiana. 
He watched his team rout the 
Hoosiers, 34-6, on Sunday.

Huntley trailed, 5-0, in his 

match 
against 
Wisconsin’s 

Timothy 
McCall, 
a 
top-10 

wrestler 
in 
the 
197-pound 

weight class. But Huntley knew 
he had his opponent on the ropes 
after finishing the end of the 
second period with a two-point 
takedown. He earned five more 
points in the third period on his 
way to a come-from-behind 9-6 
win.

In the past, Huntley has 

struggled 
taking 
on 
other 

highly-touted opponents. But 
since being named team captain, 

Huntley has put rankings out of 
his mind.

“I started saying, ‘I should 

be able to beat the guy in front 
of me,’ ” Huntley said. “That’s a 
mental trap and a problem I had 
in the past. I stopped looking at 
that. Every match you’ve got to 
wrestle hard and with grit.”

Sophomore 
heavyweight 

Adam Coon had a comeback of his 
own 
against 

Indiana. After 
suffering 
his 

first Big Ten 
defeat of the 
season 
to 

Wisconsin’s 
Connor 
Medbery, 
Coon punished 
his 
Hoosier 

opposition, 
pinning his fourth opponent of 
the past five matches.

“I would have had a better 

shot (at beating Medbery) had 
I been more aggressive,” Coon 
said. “I really should have been 
attacking more in that match, 
and that’s what I did today 
(against Indiana).”

Coon’s dominance heading 

into his match with Medbery 
may have given him confidence, 
but the ease of his victories 
also made his strategy too 
conservative. 
Making 
an 

aggressive tactical adjustment 
helped Coon return to his 
winning ways Sunday.

One of the biggest surprises 

of the weekend was redshirt 
sophomore lightweight Conor 
Youtsey, who earned two six-
point victories. Youtsey wrestled 
the first match in both duals, and 
his 
impressive 
performances 

helped carry the team.

“Our team did a great job 

following me,” Youtsey said. 
“The momentum set the pace. 
The team came behind me and 
wrestled just as tough. It’s good 
for the guys to see us be on top 
early on.”

Michigan 
came 
into 
the 

weekend knowing it had to show 
off its strength in the middle of 
the Big Ten dual grind. Nine of the 

Wolverines’ 
10 
wrestlers 

recorded 
wins over the 
weekend, and 
six 
finished 

2-0. Michigan 
coach 
Joe 

McFarland 
credited 
this 

success to the 
aggressiveness 

his lightweight wrestlers like 
Youtsey showed.

Most 
importantly, 
the 

Wolverines showed they can 
win close matches. Especially in 
the Wisconsin dual, they were 
able to find an edge in matches 
that were decided by just a few 
points.

“We had six or seven matches 

that were going to be tricky,” 
said Michigan assistant coach 
Sean Bormet. “We had to keep 
wrestling where we wanted it, 
and we did a good job of that. 
When we had to get really tough 
in tight matches, where maybe 
we didn’t wrestle quite as well 
but had to stay really tough and 
win by a point, we did it.”

On 
both 
days, 
Michigan 

needed to show it was strong 
enough to hang in the loaded Big 
Ten. The weekend proved the 
Wolverines have the guns to duel 
with the nation’s best.

‘M’ dominates Senior Day

By TED JANES

Daily Sports Writer

The 
Michigan 
men’s 

swimming and diving team’s 
Senior Day had just about 
everything you could ask for 
in a swim meet: close races, 
an electric atmosphere and an 
intense rivalry.

And when asked to rise to the 

challenge, the Wolverines did 
just that.

Saturday, No. 5 Michigan 

battled Ohio State in 16 different 
events at Canham Natatorium. 
The Wolverines (5-0 Big Ten, 
9-0 overall) won 12 of them, 
dominating the Buckeyes by a 
score of 187-117. With the victory, 
Michigan remained undefeated 
for the season.

While the day should have 

been all about the seniors, it 
was a freshman who stole the 
spotlight.

In the 1,000-yard freestyle, 

Michigan freshman PJ Ransford 
was given a huge opportunity 
when junior Anders Lie Nielsen, 
the best distance swimmer for 
the Wolverines, chose not to 
swim in the 1,000-free so he 
could rest for the following race, 

opening the lane for Ransford to 
step up in a big meet.

Ransford took the lane and set 

his career-best time, but it wasn’t 
enough. He stayed in line with 
Ohio State’s Brayden Seal for 
nearly the entire race, but in the 
final laps, the Buckeye managed 
to pull slightly ahead, touching 
the wall ahead of Ransford by a 
margin of 0.44 seconds.

“We put a lot of pressure 

on (Ransford),” said Michigan 
coach Mike Bottom. “We didn’t 
put (Nielsen) in the 1,000. We 
said that we believed (Ransford) 
could do it, which is a lot to put 
on a freshman, but he did a great 
job. He battled the whole way. It 
was a physical one for him, quite 
mental as well.”

After the race, momentum 

seemed like it would swing 
heavily in favor of the Buckeyes, 
but 
Michigan 
immediately 

silenced Ohio State’s fans. In 
the next race, the 200-yard 
freestyle, Nielsen and senior 
Justin Glanda finished first 
and second, respectively. The 
pair shut down Ohio State, 
putting a halt to the Buckeyes’ 
enthusiasm.

“You can bet that when Glanda 

in particular saw Ransford, 
he was going to protect him,” 
Bottom said. “He was going to 
step up and say to the freshman, 
‘Don’t worry about that one, I 
got this one.’ ”

Added Glanda: “In a meet like 

this, a Big Ten race against Ohio 
State, watching PJ fight so hard 
in the 1,000-free, it got me fired 
up as well as (Nielsen). We knew 
what we had to do.”

Excluding 
the 
200-yard 

backstroke, 
the 
men 
won 

everything else in the lap pool 
in a dominant performance that 
validated their top-five ranking.

At the other side of the 

pool, the Michigan divers’ best 
performance came from senior 
Thomas Jahnke, who placed 
fifth on both the 3-meter and the 
1-meter springboards. The other 
senior diver, Kevin Bain, took 
seventh in the 1-meter and sixth 
in the 3-meter.

Michigan may have lost four 

events, but it also won 12. If the 
Wolverines were looking to make 
a statement to the rest of the 
Big Ten about what they are up 
against when the championship 
meet 
comes 
around, 
they 

certainly succeeded.

It’d be a damn shame

M

ADISON — The 
Michigan hockey 
team can score goals 

at an unprecedented rate. The 
Wolverines can overcome a 4-1 
deficit with a 
snap of a fin-
ger. And this 
team is start-
ing to look 
as powerful 
as the 1997-
98 national 
championship 
team, accord-
ing to Michi-
gan coach Red 
Berenson.

“We’ve got a long way to go,” 

Berenson said, “but right now, in 
recent weeks, we’ve looked like 
the team we had in 1997.”

Still, a postseason berth is far 

from certain. And that’s a damn 
shame.

That’s not just because the 

Wolverines haven’t advanced to 
the NCAA Tournament the past 
two seasons. Instead, Michigan 
is the most exciting team to 
watch in the country, and college 
hockey fans deserve to see 
this team’s offense against the 
nation’s best defenses.

The Wolverines average a 

nation-leading 4.36 goals per 
game. The next-highest team 
averages 3.73. And in nine 
Big Ten games, Michigan is 
averaging 6.5 goals per game 
and boasts the conference’s top 
four point leaders in Big Ten 
play in senior Zach Hyman (19), 
freshman Dylan Larkin (18), 
sophomore Tyler Motte (14) and 
junior Andrew Copp (13).

Michigan is able to roll out 

four lines and expect a goal from 
each every game. Because of 
that depth, Michigan was able to 
win the Great Lakes Invitational 
without four of its best players, 
and it hasn’t lost since.

The players know they are 

part of a one-of-a-kind offensive 
team. Michigan’s players can’t 
recall being part of an offense 
that scores this easily.

“I can’t say I have. It’s pretty 

fun, though,” said freshman 
defenseman Zach Werenski 
when asked if he has been on a 
team this talented offensively. 
It’s definitely fun every night.”

But his team still knows a 

postseason berth is far from 
certain.

Unfortunately for Michigan, 

the Big Ten has been a below-
average conference this season. 
Michigan State, Ohio State 
and Wisconsin are a combined 
18-39-7. Only Minnesota 
seems like a worthy opponent 
at this point, and even the 
Golden Gophers have had an 
uncharacteristically bad season. 
Even a loss to a surprisingly 
good Penn State team would be 
hurtful.

“It’s just motivating for us that 

every game matters so much, 
because you lose one game and 
you can drop four or five spots,” 
Hyman said. “It’s just more of a 
desperation thing, and we need 
to win every game.”

One loss in the Big Ten could 

spell doom for this team. A loss 
to Wisconsin this weekend 
would have plummeted No. 12 
Michigan well out of the top 16 in 
the PairWise Rankings, in which 
the Wolverines need to finish to 
make the NCAA Tournament.

The same can be said for 

potential losses to Michigan State, 
Ohio State and Wisconsin when 
they travel to Ann Arbor. But if 
this weekend was any indication, 
the Badgers aren’t even in the 
same league as Michigan. Not 
many teams are, and Michigan 
should be the favorite to win the 
Big Ten Tournament.

But college hockey is tricky and 

funny; each game seems like a flip 
of a coin. Berenson knows that 
better than anyone. And it’d be 
damn shame if one loss puts the 
Wolverines in a win-or-go-home 
mentality heading into the Big 
Ten Tournament. College hockey 
fans deserve to see the beauty 
that is the Michigan offense.

College hockey fans deserve to 

witness Zach Hyman’s incredible 
senior season. It has been a 
campaign in which he seemingly 
puts the puck in the back of the 
net each game thanks to his 
incredible speed and willingness 
to play in the dirty areas. 
Hyman’s 1.59 points per game 
through 22 contests is greater 
than that of Kevin Porter (1.47) 
in his Hobey Baker-winning 
season in 2008.

College hockey fans deserve 

to see freshman sensation Dylan 
Larkin, who manages to put up 

multiple points per game and 
dazzle every time he touches the 
puck with vision and hockey IQ 
well beyond his years.

College hockey fans deserve 

to see the 17-year-old Werenski, 
who has stick skills that are 
unprecedented for someone his 
age — not to mention that he, too, 
is a threat to score each time he 
touches the puck, netting two 
goals Saturday at Wisconsin.

Oh, and if a team manages 

to contain those three players, 
Michigan still has Copp, Motte 
and sophomore forwards 
JT Compher and Alex Kile. 
Compher led the Wolverines 
in points last year; Kile has 20 
points this season. And in case a 
team contains those four players, 
junior forward Justin Selman 
netted a hat trick this weekend.

The Wolverines’ offense is 

truly remarkable — it’s on pace to 
score the most goals in a season 
nationally since 2004. But one 
loss in Big Ten play could make 
things problematic for this team.

And it’d be a damn shame if 

that causes Michigan to miss the 
tournament.

Michigan is still the nation’s highest-scoring team, but the Wolverines haven’t yet secured an NCAA Tournament bid.

Michigan completes 
sweep of Wisconsin

By ERIN LENNON

Daily Sports Editor

MADISON — It’s easy to forget 

the Michigan hockey team ranks 
47th nationally in team defense, 
say nothing of its unreliable 
starters in net. It’s easy to forget 
because, in two road wins over 
Wisconsin, the 16th-ranked Wol-
verines scored 13 times against 
one of the nation’s most proven 
netminders.

This offense is so good it hard-

ly needs stable goaltending.

Michigan (7-1-0 Big Ten, 15-7-

0 overall) completed its second 
series sweep in conference play 
with a 6-0 win over the Badgers 
on Saturday. It was the first time 
the Wolverines have done so 
since 1975.

Senior forward Zach Hyman 

scored a pair of goals, extending 
his goal-scoring streak to seven 
games. The streak is the longest 
since Brendan Morrison’s eight-
game stretch during the 1995-6 
season.

Morrison is one of just two 

Hobey Baker Award winners in 
program history.

Riding the nation’s longest 

winning streak, Michigan has 
now scored 33 goals over its last 
five contests.

Following an ominously slow 

start Friday, the Wolverines set 
the pace with a five-goal outburst 
in the first 22 minutes of regula-
tion. Meanwhile, the defense — 
which had allowed four goals in 
that same timespan the previous 
night — held Wisconsin (0-5-1, 
2-15-3) without a goal through 
two periods.

“That was the key to the 

game,” said Michigan coach Red 
Berenson. “I thought our team 
really was focused and prepared, 
and to score the first goal was 
huge.”

Then, after cruising through 

most of the third frame, fresh-

man defenseman Zach Werenski 
added Michigan’s sixth goal, all 
but silencing a dwindling crowd. 
Werenski was one of eight Wol-
verines 
with 
multiple-point 

games on the weekend.

“(An early lead) kinda makes 

it easier on the defense,” he said. 
“We don’t like giving up goals, 
and that’s kind of our problem 
right now. But when you have 
forwards putting up six or seven 
goals, it helps us get more confi-
dence.”

It took the Wolverines fewer 

than three minutes to net their 
eighth and ninth goals of the 
weekend against Wisconsin goal-
tender Joel Rumpel.

But what was more impres-

sive was the fact that both tallies 
came from a single shift, with 
both plays created by Hyman.

Hyman found freshman Dylan 

Larkin down for the early lead 
before finding twine with his 
now-signature move — muscling 
through traffic around the net 
with his back turned, centering, 
squaring and firing top shelf.

The early lead also allowed role 

players in sophomore defenseman 
Nolan De Jong and freshman for-
ward Alex Talcott to play valuable 
minutes. Talcott, in particular, 
had several scoring chances in 
second half of the game.

“He got some good ice time, 

and I know he can help us,” 
Berenson said. “We’re hoping 
those guys are going to grow and 
get some experience.”

For the Badgers and their 

10,000-plus fans in attendance, 
the loudest cheer of the night 
came in the second period — 
when the Kohl Center video 
board showed Wisconsin basket-
ball securing an overtime victory 
over the Wolverines from Ann 
Arbor.

And half of the student sec-

tion had dissipated by the third 
period.
