Nowhere near the rose

Athletic director
says coach will
'absolutely' be
back next year
By MATT AARONSON
Daily News Editor
Both Athletic Director Bill Mar-
tin and University President Mary
Sue Coleman said in separate com-
ments after Michigan's loss to Ohio
State this weekend that headcoach
Rich Rodriguez'sjob is safe.
The 21-10 loss to Ohio State
made the team ineligible to play
in a bowl game for the second-
straight season and left the team
with its first consecutive losing
seasons since 1962-63.
In a phone interview yesterday,
Athletic Department spokesman
Bruce Madej pointied to what
Martin told reporters after the
season-ending loss to Ohio State
University on Saturday: Rodri-
guez will be the head coach of the
football team next year.
"I and the administration fully

support him," Martin was quot-
ed as telling several outlets, "and
you'll see him in the future."
Asked to clarify whether that
meant Rodriguez would be the
coach next year, Martin said,
"Absolutely."
University spokeswoman Kelly
Cunningham spoke to the Daily
yesterday on behalf of President
Mary Sue Coleman, saying Cole-
man "supports the coach and sup-
ports the football team," but would
not comment further because of
the pending NCAA investigation.
Coleman made headlines on
Thursday when she skipped
her usual practice of talking to
reporters after a Board of Regents
meeting, instead abruptly leav-
ing through a back door once the
meeting adjourned. During that
meeting, regents discussed the
University's ongoing investigation
into allegations that Rodriguez and
his staff.violated a series of NCAA
rules. Board of Regents Chair
Andrew Richner (R-Grosse Pointe
Park) read a statement to those
in attendance, saying the regents
would not comment to the press

ong after the crowd had
left, postgame debris still
littered the expansive
green carpet of Michigan Stadium.
Rose petals were scattered across
the south end zone, remnants of
one of college football's most time-
less celebratory traditions.
This is the place - and this

Woodson clenched a plump rose

1997 national championship. And

Rose Bowl.
Buckeye fans brought vases of

During a weekend that invokes
so much gridiron history and

football has never seemed further
away.
Gone are the days of fighting
the Buckeyes for a Rose Bowl
berth. Now it's struggling for a

SGOVERNING THE G.REEKS:
Sigma Nu expelled from
IFC for rules violations

Day of Remembrance honors
transgender hate crime deaths

Fraternity house was
suspended one day
before altercation
that led to expulsion
By VERONICA MENALDI
Daily StaffReporter
The University's chapter of
Sigma Nu fraternity was expelled
from the interfraternity Council
earlier this month for a violation of
tFC bylaws and misconduct.
IFC President Ari Parritz wrote
in an e-mail interview that Sigma Nu
was suspended near the end of Octo-
ber for violating IFC bylaws and then

expelled for violatingthe terms of its
suspension within one day.
The original suspension came
after the fraternity held a registered
party during welcome week that
the Social Responsibly Committee
- which governs social functions
for both the IFC and the Panhellen-
ic Association - visited twice dur-
ing the night, according to Sigma
Nu President Jordan Eckstein.
IFC Vice President of Social
Responsibility Jason Mohr said in
an e-mail' interview that after the
first check, SRC informed Sigma
Nu that the party was in order, but
"explicitly stated" that the event
exceeded the registered event size.
When SRC returned to the party
laterto perform another check,Sigma

Nu was marked off for a few viola-
tions, including having glass bottles,
which are prohibited, having too
manyentrances inuse and exceeding
the time limit for the event, accord-
ing to the Sigma Nu Chapter History,
which wasprovided to The Michigan
Daily by Max Barack, IFCs judicial
vice president.
Mohr said the second check was
performed without an escort from
the house because SRC was unable
to contact the fraternity's then-
president Kyle Sandefur.
After the check, SRC informed
the president that it would go over
the fraternity's violations after the
party ended. It took Sigma Nu longer
than SRC expected to clear out the

MiCHIGAN'S ECONOMIC UTURE
University economist: Michigan
will see net job gains by end of 2011

Data released at
event shows slowly
declining job losses
By JAMES LEE
For the Daily
With the highest unemployment
rate in the country and not a single
annual job gainthis decade, Michi-
gan's economic woes can snake for
a depressing campus event.

But Economics Prof. George
Fulton, along with other experts
at the 57th Annual Economic Out-
look Conference, had some more
optimistic views for the downtrod-
den state.
"So how much more economic
pain do we have to endure before
the tide begins to turn and we are
creating more jobs than we are los-
ing?" Fulton, the director of the
Research Seminar in Quantitative
Economics, pondered before an
audience of academics and busi-

ness professionals assembled in
the Rackham Amphitheater last
Friday.
RSQE's 2010-2011 forecast for
Michigan's economy, delivered
by Fulton during the conference
on Friday, predicts that the state's
currently dire economic situation
will improve by the end of the 2011
calendar year.
RSQE is a program at the Uni-
versity that has compiled outlook
reports for the state and national

Students protest UC tuition hike

WORKING THE CROWD

Between 30 and 50 protestors
from UCLA and other UC campus-
es barricaded themselves inside a
UCLA building Thursday morning
while thousands more demonstrat-
ed across campus in anticipation
of UC Regents' approval of a plan
to raise tuition by 32 percent, the
Daily Bruin reported.
The Regents approved the two-
phase tuition increase through
2011 for all UC campuses Thurs-
day afternoon, according to the
Daily Bruin.
The Los Angeles Times reported
that the occupation lasted about 18
hours and yielded 41 arrests. How-
ever, the Daily Bruin reported zero
arrests pending an assessment of
damage done inside the occupied
building.
The Daily Bruin reported that
the occupation forced University
officials to te'mporarily close the
hall and cancel classes and servic-
es offered there.

KKK PROTEST OUTSIDE OLE
MISS-LSU FOOTBALL GAME
At the University of Mississippi
about 12 members of the Ku Klux
Klan gathered Saturday before the

ciated Press reported.
KKK Great Titan Shane Tate told
The Daily Reveille - LSUs newspa-
per - Thursday that Klan members
would protest the Ole Miss Chan-
cellor's decision to remove the song
"From Dixie With Love" from the
marching band's songlist.
Jones asked the band to remove
the song after fans ignored a request
that they drop the customary chant
"The South will rise again" fromthe
end of the song, The Daily Reveille
reported.
Tate told the Daily Mississippian
that Klan members would bein full
ceremonial dress, but that the rally
would be a "silent protest" in sup-
port of free speech.

Students on University of Min-
nesota and Purdue University
campuses received free copies of

cal leader and Minister Ray Com-
fort explaining creationism and
refuting evolution.
The giveaways were part of a

DETROIT
Motown celebrates
50th anniversary
Black ties and gowns filled a ball-
room Saturday in a big-bucks salute
to Detroit-style royalty - the King
of Motown, the Queen of Soul and
the Kid of Rock.
Motown Records founder Berry
Gordy, along with Aretha Frank-
lin, Kid Rock and Motown's origi-
nal kid, Stevie Wonder, came to
Motown's original hometown for
the Motown 50 Golden Gala. The
50th-anniversary event, which
fetched $350 and up for a ticket,
W was a fundraiser for the Motown
Historical Museum. The museum
was the original home of Motown
Records Corp., which Gordy start-
ed with an $800 loan.
The event drew about 750 peo-
ple and many of the big names and
behind-the-scenes people from the
label, which moved to Los Angeles
in 1972. Detroit's output included
scores of hits, including "My Girl"
by The Temptations, "The Tears of a
Clown"by Smokey Robinson and the
Miracles, and "I Heard it Through.
the Grapevine" by Marvin Gaye.
"The pleasure is mine to be here,"
Gordy said during a pre-concert
reception. "I'm thrilled Igotthe nur-
turing and all of the things Detroit
had to offer me. Motown could not
have made it in any other city."
NEW YORK
9/11 defendants will
plead 'not guilty'
The five men facing trial in the
Sept. 11 attacks will plead not guilty
so that they can air their criticisms of
U.S. foreign policy, the lawyer for one
of the defendants said yesterday.
Scott Fenstermaker, the lawyer
for accused terrorist Ali Abd al-
Aziz Ali, said the men would not
deny their role in the 2001 attacks
but "would explain what happened
and why they did it."
The U.S. Justice Department
announced earlier this month
that Ali and four other men
accused of murdering nearly
3,000 people in the deadliest ter-
rorist attack in the U.S. will face
a civilian federal trial just blocks
from the site of the destroyed
World Trade Center.
Ali, also known as Ammar al-
Baluchi, is a nephew of professed
9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed.
Mohammed, Ali and the others
will explain "their assessment of
American foreign policy," Fenster-
maker said.
CALABASAS, Calif.
Facebook incites
beating of pre-teen
Authorities say a 12-year-old
boy assaulted by a group of middle
school classmates in Southern Cali-
fornia may have been targeted after
an Internet posting urged students
to beat up redheads.
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt.
Richard Erickson says the boy, who
is redheaded, was kicked and hit in
two incidents Friday at A.E. Wright
Middle School in Calabasas. As
many as 14 students participated in
the attacks.
Erickson says the attackers may

have been motivated by a Face-
book message announcing that Fri-
day was "Kick a Ginger Day." The
posting may have been inspired by
an episode kf the television show
W"South Park."
The boy was not seriously hurt.
Erickson says there may be other
victims.
NEW YORK
Subway passenger
stabbed to death
A subway passenger stabbed to
death in front of horrified strap-
hangers has been identified as
36-year-old Dwight Johnson of
Brooklyn.
Authorities say some 30 passen-
gers watched as Gerardo Sanchez
ef the Bronx stabbed Johnson at
around 2 a.m. Saturday in an argu-
ment over a seat.
Police say the passengers were
trapped with the knife-wielding
attacker and his victim until the
train arrived at the station at Sev-
enth Avenue and 53rd Street.
Police say Sanchez was standing
*ever the blooedied victim when the
train doors epened. Johnson was
pronounced dead when the train
arrived at the station.
Sanchez, who's 37, was arrested
on charges of murder and weap-
ons possession. He had not been
arraigned on the charges as of yes-
terday afternoon.

Senate Dems at o s over health care

Final passage of bill
will hinge on
moderate Democrats
and independents
Senate Democrats yesterday
sparred with each other over how
to fix the nation's troubled health
care system, the moderates threat-
ening to scuttle legislation if their
demands weren't met and the more
liberal members warning their
party leaders not to bend.
The dispute among Democrats
foretells of a rowdy floor debate
next month on legislation that
would extend health care coverage
to roughly 31 million Americans.
Republicans have already made
clear they aren't supporting the bill.
Final passage is in jeopardy,
even after the chamber's historic
60-39 vote Saturday night to begin
debate.
"I don't want a big-government,
Washington-run operation that
would undermine the ... private
insurance that 20 million Asseri-
cans now have," said Sen. Ben
Nelson, a conservative Nebraska
Democrat.
Nelson and three other mod-
erates - Democratic Sens. Mary
Landrieu of Louisiana and Blanche
Lincoln of Arkansas and Connecti-
cut independent Joe Lieberman
- agreed to open debate despite
expressing reservations on the
measure. Each of them has warned
that they might not support the
final bill.
SIGMA NU

house, so SRC left and informed the
then-vice president that SRC would
contact Sigma Nueat a later time.
The following night the SRC
Executive Board voted to sanction
Sigma Nu with 12 weeks of social
probation because of the violations,
according to Mohr. Sigma Nu was
notified of the sanctions on Sept. 9.
Eckstein said what "really pissed
us off" most about the suspension
was that the fraternity took precau-
tions to ensure the party was safe
and regulated.
"We didn't want anything to get
unsafe but they marked us off for
stuff as we were kicking people out
of our house so it was kind of fran-
tic," he said. "And like I said, that
didn't sitwell in their eyes."
Following the IFC social proba-
tion sanction, Eckstein said Sigmea
Nu's nationals were required by the
fraternity's policy to suspend the
chapter from all activities pending
further investigation into the inci-
dent, which did occur.
Sigma Nuthen appealedthesanc-
tionesen the Greek Activities Review
Panel - the judicial panel for Greek
life. Eckstein said GARP looked into
Sigma Nu's disciplinary history and
found more issues than just the one
party. Because of these fndings,
GARPthen referred Sigma Nu to the
IFC for further punishments.
Sigma Nu's disciplinary history
dating back to 1998 includes many
significant transgressions and time
spent on social probation, according
to a document passed out to chapter
presidents at an Oct. 14 IFC meeting
and provided to the Daily by Parritz.
The documentstatedthat the fra-
ternity spent more than 50 percent
of the past four and a half years on

One ajr sickittypint is a
provisien that wuld allew Ae-
cans to buy a federal-run insurance
plan if their state allows it. Moder-
ates say they worry the so-called
public option will become a huge
and costly entitlement program
and that other requirements in the
bill could cripple businesses.
"I don't want to fix the problems
in our health care system in a way
that creates more of an economic
crisis," said Lieberman.
The sway held by such a small
group of senators has annoyed
their more liberal colleagues, who
'culd vote against a final bill if it
becomes too watered down.
Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio,
said he didn't think rank-and-file
Democrats wuld feel compelled
to go that far. At the same time,
Brown warned Democratic leaders
not to make too Iany concessions.
"I don't want four Democratic
senators dictating to the other 56
of us and to the rest of the country
- when the public option has this
much support -that (apublicoption
is) not going to be in it," said Brown.
The Senate bill would require
most Amsericans to carry instrance
and provide subsidies to those who
couldn't afford it. Large companies
could incurcosts ifthey did notpro-
vide coverage to their work force.
The insurance industry would
come under significant new regu-
lation under the bill, which would
first ease and then han the practice
of denying coverage on the basis of
pre-existing medical conditions.
Congressional budget analysts
put the legislation's cost at $979 bil-
social probation.
"Timeand timseagain,the chapter
has engaged in actions that violated
established policy and put students
and the community in danger," the
document stated.
Some of the listed infractionss
included four missed IFC meetings
in 2008 and hazing and other risk
management issues in 2005.
The document stated the IFC
would review and vote on Sigma
Nu's case at its weekly mseeting on
Oct. 21 and would give Sigma Nu
members the chance to speak.
IFC chapter presidents voted to
suspend Sigma Nu on Oct. 21. The
suspension included 13 conditions
specifically designed to rehabilitate
the chaptee, including 12 hours of
mandatory community service each
semester for each member.
During the suspension, the fra-
ternity was prohibited from host-
ing or participating in any event in
which alcohol would be served. Any
misconduct from any of Sigma Nu's
members would result in the frater-
nity's expulsion.
These terms were violated ons
Oct. 22 when two Sigma Nu mneme-
hers - a sophomore and a senior -
assaulted Barack at a srriy barn
dance social fuction, accordig to
a document sent to all IFC chapter
presidents motioningfor Sigma Nu's

Two deciding factors led to the
expulsion, according to the docu-
ment calling for Sigma Nu's imme-
diate expulsion: the assault and
Eckstein's "chastising" comments
after Sigmaa Nu's initial suspension.
Eckstein said his intent wasn't
to chastise IFC, though he said he
understands his comments were
interpreted in that manner. He said
he wanted to make the chapter pres-
idents aware that he felt the sespea-
sion was inappropriate.
Brad Beacham,executive director
of Sigma Nu's national headquarters,
said the national organizations is dit-
appointed with the IFC's decision to
expel the chapter frommembership,
but that it respects the I FC's role on
campus.
Beacham said the fraternity's
national organization believes it is
the local chapter's responsibility to
take disciplinary action in response
to individual members' misconduct,
as was the case with the Un iversity's
chapter of Sigma Nu. He said the
incident is not a reflection on the
chapter as a whole..
Eckstein said in an e-mail state-
ment that fraternity members will
remain at their current address at
7111 O~xfosrdfRd.
olloi igthe incident at the
sorority function, the local chap-
ter temporarily suspended the two
members involved, -followed by a
probationary period. Beacham said
the IFC was made aware of these'
internal actions.
According to Beacham, the FC
infornmed Sigma Nt lthat if the two
members were not permanentlt
expelleditwouild take actionagainst
the whole fraternity.
Eckstein said he feels it is not
within FC's jurisdiction to tell the
fraternity what to do with mem-
hers in situations like this.
"So we went through the pro-

cesses that we deemsed appropri-
ate and we told them that," lee said.
"I guess they just didn't agree with
ems."
Parritz wrote in an e-mail inter-
viewl ie informed Eckstein that if
the individual members weren't
expelled, the chapter presidents
would most likely vote to expel the
whole chapter.
Eckstein said Sigma Nu refused
to expel the members because the
fraternity felt submitting to IFC's
demands might set a precedent that
allowed FC "to regulate every single
member of every single fraternity."
"That's something that we
thought would be bad for Greek
Life," he said.
Barack wrote in an e-mail that
IFC doesn't typically get involved
with the internal affairs of chapters,
like dealing.with transgressions of
individual members.
Beacham said the national Sigma
Nu drganization supports the local
chapter's decision because of the
internal actions the chapter took.
He said the national headquarters
is disappointed with the IFCs deci-
sion to expel the chapter.
"I certainly do hope that after
timaepasses and the chapter contin-
ues so inmprove that IFC will wel-
come them back into membership,"
lee said.
Eckstein also said the chapter
wants to return to the IFC "however.
long it takes."
Parritz said Sigma Nu will remain
eligible to return to casspus under
the general IFC expansion pro-
cedures. The council can vote to
reopen the expansion calendar at
any time to vote to allow Sigma Nu
back into the IFC.

"We hope, though, that Sigma NeU
makes a swift and thorough transi-
tion to become the excellent chapter
it was in years past," Parritz wrote.
He said the IFC chapter presi-
dents did all they could to collabo-
rate with Sigma Nu as their chapter
"navigated through a challenging
reorganization."
"Expulsion was and always has
been a last resort," Parritz wrote. "It
pains me to see a chapter that once
flourished be forced to leave the IFC
comnmunity."
Business junior James Hazan, a
member of the fraternity, wrote in
an e-nail interview that despite its
expulsion from the IFC, the frater-
nity is still "very much alive."
He said Sigma Nu is involved in
the comesunity with projects like
Habitat for Humanity and Packages
for Patriots.
Hazan added that the fraternity is
also still engaged socially.
"We're actually pretty relieved to
be off-casspus so we don't have to
follow all of those silly IFC rules,"
he wrote. "Come down to Oxford
and Hill some time, we'll be the ones
eliciting noise cosmplaints fromthe
neighboring IFC-regulated Greek
anuses."
Sigm" Nu'snationalheadquarters
is guidingthe chapter to take action
to improve the fraternity, like edu-
cation programs, leadership con-
ferences and community s4rv ice,
according to Eckstein.
Eckstein said despite issues in
the fraternity's past, the chlapter
is "trying to be in good standing
with everyone."
"We're just going to take what-
ever is given tous and do our best to
move forward," lie said.

No more broken promises
State should fund education out of moral, practical concerns
ov. Jennifer Granholm, having already signed a budget
eliminating the Michigan Promise Scholarship, has now
returned to her pro-education rhetoric. Last week, she
urged college students to pressure the legislature to fund the pro-
gram, which helps students pay for in-state tuition. Though her
position is hypocritical in light of her signature on last month's bud-
get, Granholm is correct - the government has a duty to reverse
its decision on the Promise Scholarship. But the burden shouldn't
be on students: Instead, legislators should start doing their jobs
and find a way to fund this necessary tuition aid program.

Compulsory compassion

The Michigan Promise Scholarship,
which provides between $500 and $4,000
in merit aid to 6,172 University students,
was cut in late September by state legisla-
tors due to a $2.8 billion budget shortfall.
But apparently dissatisfied with the bud-
get bill she signed that cut the scholarship,
Granholm has begun a statewide campaign
to restore the scholarship and plans to visit
college campuses across the state. She has
suggested that the legislature, currently
enjoying its hunting season recess, amend
the Earned Income Tax Credit as a means
of funding the $120 million program.
The loss of the Promise Scholarship
is particularly painful in light of tuition
increases over the last decade. With tuition
up 52 percent since 2002, the University
of Michigan consistently ranks among
the most expensive public universities in
the country. Scholarship cuts and tuition
increases were compounded by significant
cuts to K-12 education in this year's budget.
The bottom line is a Michigan that is all but
giving up on its schools.
Such a result will be disastrous for the
state's students. While those with options
will go to other states for an education,
many will notb e able to afford tuition any-
where else. These students won't gain the
skills needed to excel in today's economy,
and will be left with fewer employment
options with lower salaries. The state
should feel responsible for helping people

to escape this future by offering compre-
hensive tuition aid.
But in addition to moral concerns, the
state should fund the Promise Scholar-
ship for practical considerations as well.
With every student who leaves Michigan
in search of better-funded and less expen-
sive schools, the state's future employment
base dwindles. The long-term result will be
a state that isn't prepared to move its econo-
my in new directions. And if the state econ-
omy can't improve, legislators are certain
to face even greater budgetary shortfalls
down the line. This is the danger in allow-
ing the cost of higher education in Michi-
gan to slip out of reach of most students.
Students shouldn't have to pressure law-
makers - as Granholm is urging - to save
the Promise Scholarship. The inherent
value of education to Michigan's future is
something that should already be under-
stood. The fact that legislators approved
a budget that doesn't fund the Promise
Scholarship and Granholm signed it speaks
volumes about the incompetence of the for-
mer and the insincerity of the latter. But
both branches of government should feel
compelled to revisit the budget debate, find
alternate sources of revenue and keep the
promise to Michigan's students.
And if they don't do that, no amount of
cutting programs or raising taxes will save
the budget of a state has given up on educa-
tion.

I would make as
many PB&J sand- EA
wiches as we could LEAH
and donate them to POTKIN
the Martha's Table
organization, which
helps provide food and clothing to
people in the Washington, D.C., area.
This was my first community service
project.
My community service habit con-
tinued because I was required to com-
plete 60 hours in order to graduate
high school. The top of every student's
report card had a section dedicated to
logging his or her hours and detailed
the hours required, hours earned and
hours remaining. Here on campus,
much of my time is consumed with
libraryvisits and fulfillingmydistribu-
tion requirements, and it seems I have,
little time (or, more correctly, I am
not readily inclined to make the time)
to give back to the Ann Arbor com-
munity. But who's to say community
service can't be a distribution require-.
ment category of its own? Think credit
hours. The University should make
community service hours a gradua-
tion requirement to motivate students
to get involved and hopefully stay
involved as a result.
I came into this university as an LSA
freshman knowingI would have to ful-
fill certain distribution requirements.
Despite the fact that I can hardly per-
form simple multiplication in my head,
I am currently enrolled in Stats 350
to fulfill my quantitative reasoning
requirement. Like it or not, fulfilling
these requirements forced me to bal-

ance all aspects of my studies - some-
thing I wouldn't have done had it not
been mandatory to do so. Just think
what students could learn if a commu-
nity service requirement was added to
the equation.
With around 25,000 undergrads, a
requirement of a mere four hours.prior
to graduation would result in over
100,000 hours contributed per gradu-
ating class. Even the overachiever of
overachievers could spare a few hours
a year to help someone less fortunate -
and what better place to do so than our
beloved A-squared community? With
elementary schools located very near
campus and a world-renowned hospi-
tal nearby, motivated students - witha
little push - could make a huge differ-
ence. Ann Arbor is a prime community
for students to find their community
service niches.
The University community prides
itself on its dedication to community
service, and while many students
already volunteer, some of us could use
the additional incentive. For example,
a friend of mine asked me to drive her
to the Food Gatherers organization a
few weeks ago. I was impressed with
her and disappointed in myself for
not taking the same initiative. But my
conscience was soon put to ease when
I learned she had to do service for her
Econ 108 class.
I'm sure people are. wondering
what's so great about her work if she's
being forced to do it. But whether her
work is required or not, people are
being helped by her efforts. Also, there
are many well-intentioned students
(I like to put myself in this category)
who have elaborate agendas in which
community service - though a nag-
ging thought - isn't a priority. But
after being pushed to complete service
hours, many people have rewarding
experiences and consequently devel-
op a life-long dedication to service.
There's no beating that.
Feeling the need to give myself that
extra push, I took it upon myself to do

some research. I would bet my cher-
ished Ohio State vs. Michigan football
ticket that few students have come
across the insanelyuseful University of
Michigan Community Relations web-
site. This website has a section dedi-
cated to community service that lists
different organizations and how to get
involved. Looking at this website, I was
like a kid in a candy shop on a service
high. There's a plethora of great orga-
nizations just craving student involve-
ment.
College students
need extra push
to volunteer.
But the University can provide even
more. I can see it now: A tab on CTools
with the words "Service 101" between
biology and English classes. For those
of you who didn't have a service
requirement in high school, the moni-
toring of hours is really quite simple.
When a student completes hours, he
or she fills out a form to submit to an
adviser and - tada - hours completed!
It's shame that so many students
miss out on the opportunity to com-
plete these often life-changing hours
because they're too busy socializ-
ing, fulfilling other requirements or
twiddling their service-able thumbs.
Community service should become
a requirement of its own to avoid this
loss of opportunity. Argue all you want
about the unfeasibility of my proposi-
tion - but when push comes to shove,
if students can fulfill distribution
requirements taking dance classes,
they should be able to get credit from
making PB&Js.

A stake in health care reform

am about to lose my health insur-
ance and face some tough choices.
It looks like I'm going to be unem-
ployed next senses-
ter. The people
who run things at 1
the Department of
Political Science
have informed me
that they won't need
my services as a
GSI. Applications to
other departments PATRICK
aren't going well,
either. And without O'MAHEN
a University job, I
will lose my Uni-
versity-sponsored health insurance.
Seniors, you'd better listen up - many
of you will lose your health coverage
the day you graduate, and Will face
some difficult decisions of your own.
According to some politicians, like
Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), that isn't
a problem. While railing against the
health care reform bill that passed in
the House of Representatives on Nov.
7, he said 10 to 15 million young Ameri-
cans under 30 freely choose to forgo
health insurance because they "don't
want to pay the premiums."
I'm only 30 years old, I'm fairly
healthy, I get 30 minutes of daily exer-
cise, I eat reasonably well and I even
floss regularly. Going without health
insurance seems like it isn't a big deal.
In fact, it might even be a smart choice,
so long as I don't get made into a hood
ornament by a drunk driver while I'm
walking home from the library late at
night. But this risk of a catastrophic
accident means I should have some
form of coverage, both for my own sake
and so that I don't stick taxpayers with
my emergency room bill.
Although I'm quite healthy now,

I suffer from Dysthymic Disorder,
which is essentially a long-term form
of low-grade depression. To treat it, I
check in with a therapist once every
two months. With my current health
insurance plan, I pay a $15 co-pay for
the visit, and the company pays the bal-
ance - more thanO$100. Without insur-
ance, I can't afford to see my counselor,
let alone buy the antidepressant I use
to supplement therapy.
So I have three "choices." The first
one is to stop taking antidepressants
and seeing my therapist. That's a fool-
ish idea, especially since I had trouble
functioning before I sought help sev-
eral years ago.
My second choice is to try to buy
insurance on the open market. But
because I'm an individual, I inherently
create more risk for an insurance com-
pany than I would as part of a large
group buying insurance, so I'll have
to pay several hundred dollars more a
month for a similar policy. Worse, my
depression qualifies as a pre-existing
condition, so I'll pay morestill - if I can
get any company to insure me at all.
My best current choice is to con-
tinue to buy into the GradCare plan for
six months under the Comprehensive
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1986, commonly known as COBRA.
I pay full price plus five percent of
the plan's monthly premium, which
is about $200 a month. That's much
cheaper than buying insurance as an
individual, but still difficult for me to
pay. I barely earned $20,000 last year
when I had a job. If I'm paying COBRA,
I probably won't have a job, certainly
not one as well-paying as a GSI posi-
tion. That means cutting the other
parts of my budget even further - and
choosing between paying for groceries
and rent won't be much fun.

What does this have to do with you
undergrads? The vast majority of you
are going to lose your parents' health
insurance coverage the day after you
graduate. If you don't have a job lined
up with insurance benefits, you'll face
a menu of the two most unpalatable
choices I outlined above: going with-
out insurance or paying an extraordi-
nary amount on the individual market.
Students face
tough choices if
current bills fail.

0

Both the House and Senate versions
of health care reform would solve
these problems instantly by mandat-
ing insurance companies to extend
coverage of children to age 26. They
would help me by subsidizing my.pre-
miums and allowing me to purchase
insurance at a group rate on a health
insurance exchange, preferably with a
public option that would compete with
private companies and drive down
rates.
The point is that health reform
isn't some arcane debate in far-off
Washington. It has dire implications
for each of our personal lives. For me,
those implications likely start on Jan.
1. For you seniors, they arrive as soon
as you graduate. If health reform fails,
I strongly suggest looking both ways
when crossing Main St. after you get
your diploma at Michigan Stadium.

Precociously classy

Carey Mulligan exudes
Oscar-worthy confidence
starring in 'An Education'
By JENNIFER XU
DailyArts Writer
The story of "An Education" can easily be
traced through Carey Mulli-
gan's wardrobe.
At the beginning, she plays
precocious 16-year-old Jenny, An Educatin
waiting on the curb after a
school orchestra rehearsal, At the Michigan
her schoolgirl's uniform sop- and Showcase
ping wet from the rain. An Sony
exciting, older man (Peter
Sarsgaard, "Garden State")
pulls up and offers her a ride, taking her through
a whirlwind romance of glamorous concerts,
art auctions and dazzling seaside vacations. Off
comes the uniform, up goes the hair and on goes
the demure yet sexy black shift.
She sensually embraces her older lover in a
knee-length lilac dress dotted with flowers and
bows. They're in Paris; it's the city of love, and
they're kind of in love. That night, she swirls
around in a floating white chiffon masterpiece
with a streak of red across the shoulders.
Later that night, once she has laid her soul -
and breasts - bare, she has no clothes at all. With
her virginity successfully lost, she has become a
woman - or so she thinks - donning a dignified
brocade sheath stitched with gold piping.
Finally, the film reaches its climax. It turns
out she's not really a woman; she's a girl. "I feel

old, but not very wise," she intonates, her hands
folded across her schoolgirl's skirt, once again
back to the beginning of the story.
It's details like these that make "An Educa-
tion" much more than the typical coming-of-
age blah. if there's anything brilliant about
director Lone Scherfig ("Italian for Begin-
ners"), it's that he knows how to contrast visual
elements, whether clothes or scenes, cutting
decisively between jazzy, electrifying dance
sequences or clipped kitchen table conversa-
tions. Yet the crown jewel of this film is not
its cinematograph', set decoration or even
costume design - it's Carey Mulligan herself.
Incandescent and effervescent, Mulligan's
portrayal and fascinating transformation from
innocent ing6nue to wise woman possesses the
nuances of an actor twice her age.
Ever since the film premiered at the Sundance
Film Festival last January, Mulligan's perfor-
mance has been on the radar for Oscar love. Yet
this isn't a conventional Oscar-baititngrole. Mul-
ligan pulls out a subtle, organic performance
with little drama. Yet there's a genuineness to
the way she speaks and the way she moves - a
genuineness that extends past the fourth wall of
cinema down into the hearts of audiences. It's a
performance you'll be able to feel through all the
pores in your body. Forget golden statues; this is
a role that will be remembered for years to come
- it's that eerily and spookily mesmerizing.
Vreviously only known for her role as Kitty
Bennet in "Pride and Prejudice," Mulligan
takes the audience straight into the film, giv-
ing the viewers a chance to experience the
world through the rose-tinted lenses of her
young character Jenny. In one scene alone, her
eyes can tell histories of emotions: ambition,

desire, wonder, discomfort, excitement, hesi-
tance. In less than two hours she evolves from
giggling schoolgirl to woman of the world and
then back again, and the transformation never
feels forced. Jenny slowly grows more confi-
dent, more beautiful, more worldly and even-
tually more cynical. It's a remarkably textured
performance.
Still, "An Education" never falls into the traps
of this type of film. Set in the time of England's
sexual reawakening, theyoungJennyrepresents
the burgeoning of women's liberation and the
inception of the British New Wave. The coun-
try was growinag up. Even as a youtsg schoolgirl,
Jenny is no blushingdaisy. "All that poetry about
something that lasts no time at all," she quips
about sex. As a girl that exudes sexual self-con-
fidence, Jenny makes her relationship with her
40-year-old lover play out less creepily than it
would otherwise. She's young, but she's no vic-
tim - a refreshing take on a young British girl's
supposed "innocence."
Although it might seem excessive to solely
praise Mulligan's performance in an-otherwise
intoxicating film, "An Education" embraces her
from the inside out. From the solid supporting
roles by seasoned British actors Alfred Molina
('Spider-Man 2"), Dominic Cooper ("The Duch-
ess"), Emma Thompson ("Love Actually") and
Rosamund Pike ("Pride and Prejudice") to the
dizzying cinematography to the exquisite cos-
tumes, all peripheral aspects merely act to orna-
ment the star of Carey Mulligan.
Toward the film's end, Jenny giddily rides a
bike while donning a flowered jumper - a sort
of intermediate between little girl and young
adult. She has bloomed before our eyes. And so
has Carey Mulligan.

The Michigan Daily - michigandaily.com

The ugly truth about my taste in music

aterialism and music don't mix.
Right? Unlike the narrative-
bound mediums of literature,
film and theater, music doesn't have to
tell a story in order to sell. It's not about
tangible things hap-
pening to tangible
people - sure, I often
picture vast "Myst"-
like dreamscapes
when I listen to
evocative post-rock
by instrumental
bands like Tortoise. JOSH
And, sure, I'll have an BAYER
imagery cocktail party
in my head whenever I play Pavement (I
triple-dog-dare you to hear "he sold his
swollen daughter in a sauna playing con-
tract bridge" without getting some serious
mind's-eye action going).
But, ultimately, music isn't about things.
It's not about conveying meaning or doling
out a take-home-message. It's not about
political expression (although Zack de la
Rocha would probably shank me for saying
that). It's about riding that immaterial wave
of noise and either feeling it in your gut or
not. And while it's probably true that the
best art - regardless of medium - packs a
punch because it woos you viscerally rather
than intellectually, music is abstract in the
sense that its mission statement is not to
represent the physical world.
Now, this isn't to say that reality-rooted
content is merely chump change in the
spiritual realm of music - listening to

a wordsmith like Conor Oberst without
attending at all to his vivid imagery would
be completely missing the point. But,
when push comes to shove, I'm in it for the
way the aural textures mesh with my ear-
drums, not for the amount of lyrical motifs
an artist can slyly tuck into one record.
Someone could transcribe the entire text,
of "Ulysses" into a 30-minute concept
album - if the singer's voice sucks, I'm not
going to give a shit.
Conversely, if the music is great but the
lyrics aren't stellar, I can usually cope.
This is especially apparent in genres
like shoegaze, where the hazy vocals
melt indecipherably into noise-damaged
soundscapes and become just another
instrument rather than a vessel for social
commentary or poetic value.
Loveless by My Bloody Valentine isn't
a classic because of its literary appeal -
the blissfully tragic atmosphere of a song
like "To Here Knows When" is severely
undercut if you read the lyrics: "Slip your
dress over your head / It's been so long /
Move on top / Because that way you touch
her too." Still, while these lines may sound
like a bad translation of a Korean soap
opera, they don't change the fact that the
song's runny-mascara acoustics make me
want to squirt some.
But this is all basically just preamble for
me to come out of the closet - I am a bad,
bad man. And as much as I preach music's
immateridliiy, I, being a devout American,
,have found ways tolet superficiality taint
my enjoyment of the medium. And no, it's

not because I watch MTV (because I don't).
When I listen to Built to Spill on
record, I am smitten. There's something
about Doug Martsch's blue-eyed, pseudo-
nasal drawl that pushes me dangerously
deep into man-crush territory. Based on
their music's bedroom charm, I'd always
pictured the band members to be a bunch
of flannel-wearing, baby-faced slackers
with ripped jeans and offhand sex appeal
- an attractive byproduct of hip mid-'90s
apathy.
But when I saw them live, my man-
crush went through the shredder.
Expecting a bunch of pretty-boy softies, I
Trying to separate
sounds from sights.
instead got the cast of '"The Big Lebows-
ki." With their back-from-the-dead facial
hair and schlubby, plumber-esque get-
up, they certainly looked like slackers,
but not the kind I had fantasized about.
In fact, I can confidently say that Built
to Spill is an ugly-looking band. And, as
guilty and shallow as I felt being turned
off by their Larry the Cable Guy blue-col-
lar-ness, I couldn't help the fact that the
band's homely exterior made me go a big
rubbery one. And, while I was admittedly
quite stoned and therefore hyper-prone
to fixating on incredibly minute details,

I must divulge that Martsch's possessed-
by-the-devil facial tics made me severely
uncomfortable. After a while, I fixed my
eyes resolutely on the band's guitars so
that I could get my head out of the gutter
and siiply revel in their jam-band chops
like a normally functioning human being.
This may seem minor, but it wasn't an
isolated event. The second time I saw
Yeasayer live, I was incredibly impressed,
and it took me a second to figure out
why I had been so irritated the first
time. Then I realized that the bassist
had chopped off his obnoxious-looking
braids, and that had probably made all
the difference. And I have trouble turn-
ing a blind eye to the fact that Avey Tare
from Animal Collective looks a little bit
too much like a frat boy to be fronting
such an enigmatic band.
I am not pleased with myself. If any art
form should be freed from the societal
mold of appearance, it's music. Music has
no celebrity-ptar system. It isn't even a
visual medium. So it seems like, theoreti-
cally, it should be exempt from all that
red-carpet bullshit. ButI just can't help
the fact that, if a musician is unpleasant
to look at, I'm going to have an unpleas-
ant time looking at them. Do I feel like an
asshole? Yes. Yes, I do. I just hope someone
else reads this and empathizes with me so
I can stop feeling like such a heathen.

CHEF
From Page 5A
sitting in front of a television.
"Chef Academy" is for this per-
son - the sophisticated reality
addict. Bravo does a fine job of
honing in on series that play up
tension and catfights, but here the
network seems to aim for a new
demographic. It's now possible
to see how people improve their
cooking instead of watchingthem
get voted off for a lapse in judg-
ment. While "Chef Academy"
gives young cooks a chance, it
also shows the process of learning
to be a fantastic cook instead of
people proving they're fantastic
cooks.
"Chef Academy" is an inspir-
ing show that doesn't attempt
to make a chef out of you, but
does its best to bring some
respect back into the kitchen.
It's refreshing to geta glimpse of
the candidates before they make
it onto the show. Either Bravo is
really great at setting the mood
or Chef Novelli actually has a
hand in choosing the right peo-
ple for his academy.
On "Chef Academy," reality
meets respectability and cuisine
meets art on a non-competitive
level. With these two arguably
unexplored aspects of culinary
TV brought together, it's worth a
watch even if all it reaps is a pas-
sionate love-fest in the kitchen.
Wine and burgers for dinner?
Well, it's better than justburgers.

REMEMBRANCE
From Page IA
by reading from poems he wrote
about the prejudice transgender
people face and the strength it
takes to overcome it.
Following a poetryreading,vigil
participants in the room each read
the name of a transgender person
who had been killed within the
past year and placed a rose in a
vase. After doing this, participants
could take a stone to represent the
strengths and challenges the trans-
gender community faces.
Accordingto the National Coali-
tion of Anti-Violence Programs,
2,424 victims reported anti-LGBT
violence to the organization in
2008. LGBT murders are at their
highest reported levels since 1999,
the report found.
Public Policy junior Stephanie
Parrish saidshe feels it's important
to have events like the Transgen-
der Day of Remembrance because
the transgender community is
"often invisible, even within the
LGBT community."
"So I think that it helps to put

them in the spotlight so we can be
a real community for at least one
day," she said.
Denise Brogan-Kator, a trans-
gender woman and co-founder
of the Rainbow Law Center - a
law firm dedicated to serving
the LGBT community - said in
a speech after the vigil that she
hopes "the world will see the trag-
edy and the injustice and that they
will someday embrace us."
"There will be no memorial
wall built by our country to honor
them," she added. "But make no
mistake, these are our she-roes
and our heroes."
She also played "Taps" in
memory of those who died and
explained that, to her, "Taps" is a
song "to say goodbye."
Attendees were then invited to
share stories of loved ones or any-
thing elsethey felt like contributing.
Noah Meeks, an activist who
came to the event, said he want-
ed to use his life to contribute to
transgender rights.
"I woke up one day and I real-
ized my life could have a greater
impact on the world than my
death," he said.

RODRIGUEZ
From Page 1A
about the investigation.
Both the NCAA and University
investigations were provoked by an
Aug.30Detroit Free Press reportthat
alleged the program "consistently
has violated NCAA rules govern-
ing off-season workouts, in-season
demands on players and mandatory
summer activities under coach Rich
Rodriguez," citing "six current or
former players" who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
The Athletic Department
launched an investigation into the
matter the following day, and the
NCAA sent Coleman a letter of inqui-
ry on Oct. 23 announcing plans forits
own investigation. The letter said the
NCAA intends to complete the inves-
tigation by the end of this year.
A University audit released on
Nov. 15 showed that the football
team failed to appropriately turn
in Countable Athletically Related
Activities forms - or practice logs.
The failure to turn in CARA forms,
the auditors stated, did not itself
constitute an NCAA violation.

economies since 1971.
According to the RSQE report,
employment and personal income
levels for Michigan hit record lows.
during 2009. Employment shrank
by 6.8 percent, while personal
income decreased by 3.4 percent.
RSQE estimates that a total of
282,900 jobs will be lost in 2009;
that figure is predicted to shrink
to 54,000 jobs lost in 2010, with
losses in 2011 shrinking further to
36,000. However, the RSQE fore-
cast also predicts that there will
be modest levels of net job creation
for Michigan bythe fourth quarter
of 2011, a trend that is expected to
continue into 2012 as well.
Fulton, who spoke on the second
day of the conference, said Michi-
gan's particularly weak economy
this year "is related, of course, to the
unprecedented industry crisis that
the domestic automakers and their
suppliers went through in 2009."
At least since the early 1990s,
Fulton said, automotive sales and
overall employment levels across

the state shared a "striking corre-
lation."
In closing, Fulton emphasized
the importance of diversifying the
state economy, as well as the need
to reevaluate and retool the state
budget process to bring revenues
and expenditures into alignment.
Following Fulton's speech,
Arthur Schwartz, general direc-
tor of labor relations for General
Motors Corp., gave a presentation
about the company's recent expe-
rience with the challenges of cor-
porate restructuring. According
to Schwartz, a University alum,
GM's position in 2009 is grim but
improving.
While admitting that the Chap-
ter 11 bankruptcy experience was
arduous, Schwartz said GM is
already emerging from restructur-
ing a leaner and more profitable
company.
Much like Michigan's economy
suffered from dependence on the
automotive sector, Schwartz said
that GM ultimately placed too
much of its hopes on continued
demand for trucks.
In addition to a diversified
product lineup and better profit

margins across vehicle classes,
Schwartz said that GM's success-
ful efforts to manage debt and cur-
tail expenditures signal that better
times are ahead for the company.
The third and final speaker
at the conference on Friday was
Timothy Bartik, senior economist
for the W.E. Upjohn Institute for
Employment Research. Bartik's
presentation offered eight specific
policy recommendations that he
argued would promote Michigan's
economic development in the long
run.
Notably absent in Bartik's pre-
sentation was any mention of the
automotive industry. Instead,
he most prominently suggested
increasing educational investment.
Among other recommendations,
Bartik claimed that expanding
pre-kindergarten programs, career
academies and summer school
offerings would provide cascading
benefits over several decades as
students enter the workforce with
better educations and stronger
credentials.
As for educating adults, Bartik
said that job re-training closely
linked to specific employers - like
apprenticeships - was another
cost-effective way to improve
Michigan's long-term economic
prospects.
Bartikclosedbysayingthatstate
lawmakers should invest "at least a
billion (dollars) or two a year" in
these educational programs.
"If you're not willing to invest
that, then you're not serious about
affecting things," he said. "You're
just playing games."

we'll be humbled again. When
you'get in this profession, there's
enough humility to go around for
everybody.
"I'm tired of being humbled."
So are Michigan football
fans, who have witnessed 13
conference losses in the last two
seasons, almost doubling the
amount of games the Wolverines
dropped to conference foes (14)
from 2000-07.
And in the last two years,
Michigan has especially tripped
up in the game that matters most,
geching outscored 63-17 against
Ohio State.
It's simple. Rich Rodriguez says
he's "building a program." But at
this point, it's taken way too long
and the program has taken way
too big of a dip.
There are only four other BCS
conference teams - Iowa State,
Indiana, Washington State and
Washington - that have lost
13-plus conference games in the
last two years. Baylor will join the
list if it loses to Texas Tech next
weekend.
Not even perennial bottom-
dwellers like Duke, Vanderbilt and
Syracuse are on that list. W
"It's hard any time you lose,"
secondary coach Tony Gibson
said. "I don't care where you are
or what you're doing, it's always
hard to lose. You know, you
work 353 days a year for these 12
moments. And we came up short
in seven of them."
Except a down year for Michi-
gan traditionally involves no more
than four losses. This two-year
stretch feels more like an apoca-
lyptic meltdown.
Rodriguez deserves at least
one more season to right the
ship. With hopefully another
full recruiting class coming
in - including freakishly good
quarterback Devin Gardner - the
coach will theoretically do what0
he preached after Saturdays loss:
Recruitthe student-athletes that
fit his system and develop their
talent.
After all, that's his job, right?
But if the Wolverines find
themselves in a similar position
next year - heading into another
lackluster matchp with the Buck-
eyes in Columbus while hoping
for bowl eligibility - it's hard to
imagine that Rich Rod wouldn't
have worn out his welcome.

MEN'S BASK ETBALL
Sims' hot hand leads
Michigan over Huskies

'M' ends five-game skid in series split

By CHRIS MESZAROS
Daily Sports Writer
After struggling through much
of Friday's opening half against
Houston Baptist, the Michigan
basketball team went to a likely
source to find a cure - forward
DeShawn Sims.
But it wasn't from the senior
forward's usual spot in the post.
As 16th-ranked Wolverines
pulled away from the Huskies in
the second half en route to a 77-55
win, Sims's shooting from beyond
the arc ignited the team.
After the Wolverines missed 16
of their first 20 shots and allowed
the Huskies (0-4) to gain a five-
point lead, Sims finally got Michi-
gan (2-0) going. He spotted up
from the wing and nailed a three
to start the rally.
"I've been shooting the ball
great lately," Sims said. "That

zone really forced us to shoot
some threes today andI'm glad I
hit them."
Just . 20 seconds later, the
senior hit the same shot from the
same spot.
Aftfer it was clear that Sims had
the hot hand, his teammates kept
feeding him the ball, and Sims
made two more threes to end the
first half. He finished with five
total in the game.
The late first-half run helped
Michigan take a 41-29 lead into
the locker room.
"When he's hitting from the
outside, you have to look for him,"
freshman guard Darius Morris
said of Sims. "Once he hit them
back-to-back, you have to keep
looking for him, even if he miss-
es."
Sims finished the game shoot-
ing 7-of-18, including 5-of-8 from

TOLEDO, Ohio - Going into
this weekend's home-and-home
series against Bowling Green, all
four of Michigan's wins had one
thing in common - three goals
before the first intermission.
And against the Falcons, the
Wolverines desperately needed
that type of quick start. No. 16
Michigan stood at 4-6 before the
start of the series - its worst ten-
game opening stretch in 23 years.
The team was also trying to
elude a five-game losing streak,
which would have been its longest
since 1988.
The Wolverines extended that
streak after losing in Friday's
game, but they did garner their
first win since Oct. 31 with a 4-1
victory Saturday.
Another three-goal first period
spurred Michigan's fifth win.
"That was huge," Michigan
coach Red Berenson said. "I
thought we had a quick start (on
Friday), but it never amounted

to enough. We got one goal and
then we gave up a goal, but we had
seven really good chances.
But on Saturday, the Wolverines
converted on those chances.
Junior winger Carl Hagelin
put the Wolverines (5-7-0) on the
board just over two minutes into
their first-ever game at Toledo's
Lucas County Arena with a tip-in
goal off of a Brandon Burlon shot.
Freshman A.J. Treais and senior
Brian Lebler also tallied goals in
the first period, as Michigan held a
3-1 lead and a 16-4 shot advantage
heading into the second period.
Neither team scored in the
middle stanza, but the Wolverines
imposed their will in the defensive
zone and held the Falcons to just
three shots.
And in the third period, with
a dangerous power play looming
for the Falcons, Michigan utilized
their conference-best penalty kill
to silence the Bowling Green threat
and put the game away.
"For once, we actually played all
60 minutes," Hagelin said. "In the

behind the are, for 22 points
and six rebounds. The senior
also reached a career milestone,
picking up his 500th rebound as
a Wolverine.
Though Harris led the team
in scoring (25 points), he was
inconsistent all night, shooting
just 8-of-21. But his free throws
kept Michigan in the game early
and he finished 8-of-11 from the
charity stripe.
The Huskies started the game
playing a 1-3-1 defense that gave
the Wolverines trouble. And
while Michigan, did get some
good looks in the opening min-
utes, the team didn't hit its
shots, making just 38 percent in
the game. Only Harris and Sims
finished the contest with more
than 10 points.
Michigan coach John Beilein

was concerned with his team's
interior defense and rebound-
ing. Houston Baptist's lead-
ing scorer, Mario Flaherty (17
points), picked up nine offensive
rebounds and turned most of
them into baskets. Overall, the
Huskies outrebounded Michi-
gan 52-39.
Beilein hopes the game's
opening minutes will be a teach-
ing tool, particularly as the team
heads to Lake Buena Vista, Fla.
this Thursday to battle Creigh-
ton in the Old Spice Classic.
"We haven't struggled in a
game since Oklahoma beat us
(last year), " Beilein said. "You
forget what it's like, and it's
important that we learn from
the experience of playing teams.
They were very aggressive and
it's certainly better than when
we would have just walked away
from somebody. We'll learn from
it."

CUIF REEDER/Daily
Ohio State fans celebrate after Saturday's win. The Buckeye faithful came out in full force for the game, and by the end of the game, were ouder than Michigan fans.
Too iTuc re Uin the Big House

Ynou all heard it. The first
time Ohio State fans
attempted the "O-H-
1-0" chantt
around the
massive bowl
of Michigan
Stadium,it was
drowned out in
an onslaught
of boos and
hatred. ANDY
By the end REID
of the fourth
quarter -
when it was
apparent that the Wolverines
would fall to their most hated
rival for the sixth consecutive
year - Michigan fans lacked the
energy and passion to dam the
flood of Buckeye joy.
"O-H-I-O" rang out in the Big
House, over and over, for what
seemed like half a century. The
signs came out - scarlet-and-gray
text reading "Rich Rodriguez,
we love you!" and "2,191 days and

counting" and "Another Buckeye
Championship" - to taunt the
Michigan faithful even more.
And following Tate Forcier's
fourth and fStal interception,
the enormous Ohio State fac-
tion began to chant, "This is our
house, this is our house."
And, you know what? For that
day, it was.
"It felt good," Buckeye receiver
Ray Small said. "Every time I've
been here I've celebrated after the
gamee. It felt kind of homey.
And the only people to blame
for that are Michigan fans. Those
who gave up on this season. Those
who sold their tickets on Stub-
Hub or EBay. Those who had the
audacity to sell their tickets to
the greatest rivalry in sport to the
opposing team's fares.
You know what happens when
a Michigan fan tries to scalp a
ticket in Columbus? The seller
looks you up and down, surveys
your maize-and-blue attire and
succinctly says, "Fuck you." He

turns around and tries to sell to
someone else.
Buckeye fans apparently didn't
meet the same resistance Satur-
day.
I can't count the number of
Brutus the Buckeye dolls I saw
or the number of times I heard
that "Hang on Sloopy" song when
I walked around the tailgating
scene at Ann Arbor Pioneer.
But having that many Ohio
State fans in Michigan Stadium is
downright embarrassing.
The entire south end zone
looked be red. Maybe the Buckeye
fans' attire just stood out that
ruch, but the rest of the stadium
seemed- to e housing a lot of
Buckeye fans, too. A member of
the Athletic Department said it
reminded him of the 1969 game in
that aspect, with the sheer num-
ber of people making the trip up
from Columbus.
And that's pretty much the only
way in which Saturday's contest
resembled the famous 1969 game.

When the Buckeyes trotted
over to their fanbase in post-
game celebration - a sight that's
become all too familiar after eight
home losses in the last two years
- they sang the fight song and
swayed to the alma mater as if the
game had been played in Ohio Sta-
dium. It might as well have been.
I will give credit to the student
section, which came out in full
force, but the rest of the stadium
was absolutely unacceptable.
I realize the team sucked this
year, to put it bluntly. But this
was Michigan-Ohio State, and
it ended up being a pretty good
game, despite five offensive turn-
overs.
To see that much red in Michi-
gan Stadium was embarrassing,
simple as that.
And if you sold your ticket this
weekend, you were part of the
problem.

By RUTH LINCOLN
Daily Sports Editor
During Ohio State week, Dono-
van Warren decided he wanted
one more shot at the Buckeyes.
Following Michigan's 21-10 loss
to No. 10 Ohio State, the junior
cornerback was asked if he would
return next season instead of leav-
ing to enter the NFL Draft early.
"Uh, yeah," he said before
turning to sign autographs out-
side Michigan Stadium.
Warren may have been caught
up in the
moment after NOTEBOOK
the game, but he
sounded much less certain about
his future at last Monday's press
c conference.
"I'm going to look into where
I stand," Warren said on Nov. 16.
"If it's the best thing for me to
do for my family, then I'll have to
decide that. But if it's not, then I'll
be here helping Michigan."
Easily the Wolverines' most
talented member of the class of
2011, Warren was tied this season
for fifth in the Big Ten in inter-
ceptions (four) and was sixth in
pass breakups (seven).
ESPN.com's NFL DraftTracker
has the 6-foot, 185 pounder listed
as the No. 4 cornerback and the
42nd-best prospect, making him
a potential second-round pick.
Throughout the Wolverines'
defensive woes this season War-
ren remained a stabilizing force.
Should he enter the draft, he
would leave a young and inex-
perienced secondary in an even
worse position.
Big Ten opponents outscored
the Wolverines this season 266-
177, with many of those points
coming off big plays downfield
that were made possible by the
secondary's mistakes. Michigan
is set to return its entire back
four, but without Warren, a year
of experience may not be such a
step forward.
FORCIER
From page lB
said of Forcier's inconsistency.
"You can't praise one and be mad
at him on the other one. You just
kind of teach on both of those."
Michigan coach Rich Rodri-
guez re-emphasized after the
game that it is a rarity for true
freshmen to play at the college
level, let alone as a starting quar-
terback. And next year, Forcier
will be likely be the poster child
for what experience can do for a
team.
But for now, the decision to
put Robinson in for Saturday's
final five minutes showed that
even after a year of experience,
Rodriguez may still be looking for
an answer at quarterback during
crunch time. The Robinson-led
offense went three-and-out on
Michigan's final offensive drive.
He finished with 31 yards rushing
on 10 attempts, and was just 2-of-
4 for three yards in the air.
"The boy was bouncing off the
walls the last three or four weeks,
inching to play, wanting to play.
And we just wanted to utilize him
today," Magee said of Robinson.
"I think we used him how we
wanted to, how we planned to."

Warren clearly understands
how Michigan's 5-7 season will
affect his future.
"I feel like I'm right up there
with some of the best in the coun-
try, but a lot of times, it's not a
matter of individually, it's a mat-
ter of the team's success," Warren
said. "But personally, I feel like
I'm one of the top in the country
with my confidence and just my
ability."
Senior defensive end Brandon
Graham was in Warren's shoes
last year - the talented junior
contemplated leaving for the NFL
after the Wolverines' woeful 3-9
performance. But Graham elect-
ed to stay another year to help
rebuild a program and, as he puts
it, "not grow up too fast."
Although Graham's senior
year fell short of his expectations
DEFENSE
From page 1B
said. "We tried our hardest. We
gave it our all."
For the seniors walking U the
Michigan Stadium tunnel one
last time, it was the hardest climb
in the 5-7 rollercoaster season.
But when they ran out on the
field before the game, it was clear
the defense and its leaders were
ready for a special game.
"They were inspired," red-
shirt junior Stephen Schilling
said. "We kind of knew they were
going to have a big game."
Graham moved into second
on Michigan's career tackles-
-for-loss list with a sack and four
takedowns behind the line of
scrimmage. Two of them came in
the third quarter with Ohio State
poised to score. Graham barely
seemed to notice the offensive
tackle in his path.
And swarmingbehind him was
Brown.
Three of the linebacker's seven
tackles Saturday came on third
down. Overall, the Wolverines
stopped the Buckeyes on 11, of 15
third downs.
"I'm glad for Brandon Graham
and Stevie Brown and the seniors

without a bowl appearance and
an abysmal U-7 Big Ten record, his
25 tackles for loss and 9.5 sacks
garnered him attention from NFL
scouts and bolstered his image.
He's projected as the 24th-best
prospect in the first round by
ESPN NFL Draft analyst Mel
Kiper.
Warren said Te must get bigger,
faster and stronger to compete at
the next level. Like Graham, the
extra yearlof college football would
do him more help than harm.
"The game has slowed down
a lot, but for it to slow dowiT a
lot more, and just evei slower,
another year would definitely
help," Warren said.
RECEIVER UNION: During the
final minutes of Saturday's loss,
Greg Mathews sat solemnly on TAn
equipment chest on the sideline.
on the defense that we were able
to come out and play a pretty full
game together like we did," Vanl
Bergen said. "I have no bad feel-
ings towards the way our defense
played."
Mouton, who has played
inconsistently all year, uncharac-
teristically led Michigan with 11
tackles and picked off Ohio State
quarterback Terrelle Pryor's first
pass in the second half. S
The turnover temporarily
sparked the offense, which took
advantage of the turnover t-
score its only touchdown of
the game.
Freshman running back
Vincent Smith's 18-yard
reception was just the Wol-
verines' second touchdown
in three years against the
Buckeyes.
Highly touted junior cor-
nerback DoAiovall Warren,
who said after the game that
he would be back with the
Wolverines next year, post-
ed seven tackles and tipped
Pryor's intercepted pass.
And two walk-ons - line-
backer Kevin Leach and
safety Jordan Kovacs - were
second and third in tackles.
"We did our assign-
ments," Van Bergen said,

Redshirt freshman slot receiver
Roy Roundtree walked over and
gave the senior wide receiver one

Roundtree had just completed
his second 100-yard receiving per-
formance this season. Mathews,
meanwhile, finished his Michigan
career without ever reaching the,
century mark.in a gaie.
When Roundtree arrived at
Michigan, Mathews immedi-
ately took the Trotwood, Ohio
native under his -wing. This sea-

Mario Manningham and Adrian

After sophomore Martavious
Odoms was injured In the second
half of the season, Roundtree filled
describing the change in the
defense this week. "We put a lot
more time into it and we had a
lot more cleaner game as far as
assignment football. When you
do that, you're always going to
be a little bit better, and I think
that's what was the big differ-
ence tod ay."
The Wolverines held Ohio
State to fewer yards than any of
their other Big Ten opponents.
Just two of the Buckeyes'
drives lasted longer than six

in effortlessly. He finished as the
Wolverines' leading receiver with
32 receptions and 424 yards.
At just 170 pounds, Roundtree
will need to bulk up if he wants to
transition to an outside receiver,
as some suspect he will next sea-
son. Should lie move, he would fill
Mathews' spot.
"It's just working in the weight
- room in the offseason," Round-
tree said. "I'm really going to
pick up some more weight. I don't
know if they'll put me outside or
keep me at the slot, but I'm going
to be ready for next year."
BOREN BLUNDERS: If one
Buckeye was bound to receive
a harsh welcome, it was Justin
Boren.
Saturday's game marked the
former Wolverine's first return
to the Big House since he played
against Ohio State in 2007. Boren
transferred after Rich Rodri-
guez was named Michigan's head
coach, and as he left the program,
he famously talked about the
team's "eroding family values."
Boren received his fair share of
Rack from the Michigan fans and
players. But after the game, he
seemed as calm as ever.
"He was a bigger man by not
turning around and not giving ST
to whoever was taking shots at
him," Ohio State center Michael
Brewster said.
Saturday's game was the first in
the Big House for Boren's younger
brother, Zach, a freshman for the
Buckeyes. And Brandon Graham
wasn't letting the brothers off
easy.
"I said, 'Yeah boys, y'all got
hard hitting,' " Graham said.
"Because when we made that
tackle on Pryor, I don't know
what happened, but I seen Boren,
he bump into (his brother), and I
was like, 'Yeah Boren, you still,
you still a Michigan Man, you still
trying to tackle Ohio State play-
ers.' But I tried to joke around a
little bit."
plays.
But as good as Michigan's
defense was, the scarlet-and-gray
one was better.
After the Wolverines crept
within four points, Ohio State
held Michigan to a three-and-
out, intercepted three passes
- includingone in the end zone -
and forced a turnover on downs
to end the game.
Somehow, in the end, those
fourteen points were just too
much for Michigan.

By AMY SCARANO
Daily Sports Writer
Five minutes into the second
half of yesterday's game, the
Michigan women's basketball
team cut No. 19 Kansas' lead to
four.
But after rallying from a
17-point halftime deficit, the
Wolverines' surge didn't equal
success. Michigan lost to the
Jayhawks 77-66 in Lawrence,
Fsan., for its first loss of the sea-
son.
The Wolverines shot nearly
50 percent from behind the
arc in the second half, but it
wasn't enough to make up for
the defensive mishaps that
snapped the team's three-game
win streak.
"Defense is something that
helps you win the game," junior
guard Veronica Hicks said. "I
think our effort was there, but
we made mistakes and they were
able to capitalize on them."
Yesterday's game in Allen
Fieldhouse marked the Wolver-
ines' first on the road this sea-
son. It was also the first meeting
between the teams in program
history.
The game offered the Wolver-
ines a chance to see what kind

of competition they could be
up against once Big Ten season
begins.,
"I think it put us in a good
situation, because the first three
games we didn't face this, where
we were coming back from a
deficit," Hicks said. "Losing and
coming back, and we had some
bright spots in there and that's
all a part of what we are doing.
That's something that we need
to do."
For a team known for its
strong defensive ability last sea-
son, yesterday's performance
was uncharacteristic. Michigan
coach Kevin Borseth knows all
too well that half-court bas-
ketball is dangerous, but in the
past, he has had to worry about
a lack of offensive performance,
not defensive.
"You've got to get early
offense because it's too hard to
just play half-court basketball
for 40 minutes," Borseth said
after Michigan's first win of
the season against Ball State,
in which the Wolverines were
impressive on offense, "We tried
that for the last two years, and it
was hard for us."
But against Kansas, defense
was the problem.
The effort was there, but

Kansas capitalized on too many
Michigan mistakes.
"We were just passing up easy
stopping and our defense was
not what we expected it to be,"
freshman guard Dayeesha Hol-
lins said. "That's pretty much
how we lost.
"We were just having a hard
timne rotating, and wherever
their main scorer was, we just
weren't.'
It was Hollins's first collegiate
away game, and she struggled to
call plays above the loud oppos-
ing crosid.
But Michigan's comeback
effort could be promising for the
future.
Although they couldn't stop
a 21-11 run by Kansas with less
than 15 minutes remaining in
the second half, the Wolverines
learned from their season's first
deficit.
in addition to struggling
defensively, rebounds proved a
challenge for the teai, with the
exception of freshman guard
Jenny Ryan's career-high eight.
Redshirt senior Ashley Jones
contributed six rebounds.
Michigan has a long road
ahead, with seven more away
games before they return to
Crisler.

DEFENSIVE END BRANDON GRAHAM
There's really nothing more to say about one of
Michigan's greatest defensive players ever. But we
have space, so we'll try to do him justice. Graham
finishes-his career second all-time in career sacks,
tackles for loss and forced fumbles. He also leads the
country with 25 tackles for loss. Everyone will miss
him next season, but can still watch him on Sundays.

QUARTERBACK TATE FORCIER
Before the OSU game, Forcier said he would do
anythingto make sure Michigan's seniors made a
bowl. He added he'd spend 10 extra hours watching
film just to get the win. Well, maybe the 11th hour was
the critical one. Forcier had five turnovers against
OSU, including a fumble for a TD and an interception
in the end zone. That's going to be a long offseason.
