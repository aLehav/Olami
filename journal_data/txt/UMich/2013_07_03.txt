Losing the two-time Big Ten
Athlete of the Year is plenty hard
enough for any program. But
that's not all the Michigan men's
tennis team lost this off-season.
On May 24, Michigan's men's
assistant tennis coach, Mark
Merklein, left the program to take
an equal position at the University
of Florida. Merklein played a key
part in leading the Wolverines to
two straight NCAA tournament
appearances and really clicked
with the players.
However, Michigan has since
hired a new associate head coach
in Jeremy Wurtzman.
Wurtzman is leaving his cur-
rent position as the University of
Denver's head women's tennis
coach. In his tenure at Denver, he
tallied a 31-14 record and led the
Pioneers to their first-ever NCAA
tournament.
- Prior to his stint at Denver,
Wurtzman was an assistant coach
at Ohio State University, where
he also played college tennis. As
a Buckeye, he became the top-
ranked player in the country.
But would donning the Block
'M' be difficult for an Ohio State
alumni?
"No. Definitely not. I am just
excited to build on the tradition of
Michigan tennis."
Michigan head coach Bruce
Berque was thrilled when Wurtz-

man accepted his position.
"To me, he's the whole package
of what I'm looking for," Berque
said. "Normally you have an idea
of what you're looking (for) in a
coach, such as a coach who can
recruit, one with playing experi-
ence or a coach who has been a
head coach already. Jeremy has
got it all. I don't know him as well
as Mark Merklein, but I know he
will be great for the guys and a
great example."
A main factor in Berque's deci-
sion was Wurtzman's experience.
The new coach reached a top-30
ranking of American tennis play-
ers, and certainly understands the
grind of the ATP tour.
"Playing professionally has
helped me learn the feelings and
the pressures of tennis," Wurtz-
man said. "In practice, I know
what the players need to do to
push themselves and when they
can let up a bit. I know what the
players are going through."
It's clear the program has
two great coaches, and despite
the losses the Wolverines have
endured, the program is trending
forward.
Berque has been successful
with all three of his assistants,
and Wurtzman will be no differ-
ent.
"He is going to take a lot of
ownership with the program as
opposed to someone who's just
going to be an assistant," Berque
said. "His reputation is spotless."

Five Wolverines selecte

NEWARK, N.J. - Michigan
commit JT Compher has been
selected in the second round of
this year's NHL Draft by the Buf-
falo Sabres with the 35th overall
selection. The Carolina Hurri-
canes originally held that pick,
but the Sabres dealt defenseman
Andrej Sekera to the Hurricanes
in exchange for the selection and
defenseman Jamie McBain.
Compher played the past two
seasons, which he called "amaz-
ing," with the United States
National Team Development Pro-
gram and will join the Wolverines
roster this fall. His style of play is
that of an agitator, and he'll head
to Buffalo next week for the orga-
nization's development camp.

"I'm a gritty, two-way cen-
ter," Compher said minutes after
his selection. "Overall, I'm just a
really competitive guy that will
do anything for the team."
He is the first player with a
connection to the Michigan pro-
gram to be selected in this year's
draft. Last year, defenseman
Jacob Trouba went to the Win-
nipeg Jets with the eighth over-
all pick and signed an entry-level
contract following a successful
freshman season at Michigan.
"It's great to be wanted," Com-
pher said. "It's a great organi-
zation. I think it's going to be a
great opportunity for me in the
next couple years to try and make
the club."
A PAIR OF JETS: One year
after Trouba became Winni-
peg's blue-chip prospect, the Jets
decided to take another Wolver-
ine. Alternate captain Andrew
Copp, a sophomore forward,
was selected by Winnipeg in the
fourth round. Michigan assis-
tant coach Brian Wiseman had
told the Daily that Winnipeg had
expressed some degree of interest
in the former Skyline High School
quarterback.
Copp said that he and Trouba
had been texting back and forth
throughout the day, with Trouba,
the current member of the Jets
organization, hoping his team
would land his former teammate.
The two are great friends and
have played together for the past
nine seasons, including a stint
with the National Team Devel-
opment Program. Trouba got his
wish when Winnipeg used the

104th overall selection on Copp,
who posted an 11-10-21 line his
freshman year.
NOTES: Michigan incoming
freshman Michael Downing was
selected by the Florida Panthers
in the fourth round. ... Another
incoming freshman, forward
Tyler Motte, was selected by the
Stanley Cup champion Chicago
Blackhawks with the final selec-
tion of the draft's fourth round.
Motte, whose Ontario Hockey
League rights are held by the
Sarnia Sting, said Michigan fans
shouldn't worry about where
he'll play the upcoming season.
"Michigan's where I'm planning
on going.".-.
MORE: Incoming freshman o
defenseman Nolan de Jong was N
selected by the Minnesota Wild
in the seventh round follow-
ing a successful season with the C
Victoria Grizzlies of the British
Columbia Hockey League out of d
Canada. ... Incoming freshman
forward Evan Allen and incoming
freshman defenseman Spencer t
Hyman, were not selected.... ThisW
is the fourth time since 2000 thatQ
the Wolverines have had at least
five players go in the NHL Draft.

ban on
benefits
4lfted
After DOMA
decision, same-sex
couples in state to
gain employee perks
By TAYLOR WIZNER
Daily StaffReporter
A U.S. District Court Judge
ruled Friday that a 2011 Michigan
law prohibiting public employers
from offering benefits to employ-
ees' same-sex partnerships was
unconstitutional. The State
House Bill 4770 was challenged
by the American Civil Liberties
Union in 2012.
This decision comes after a
week fueled with debate over
rights for same-sex partners.
Earlier in the week, Democrats
put forward five bills on the topic
of marriage equality, followed by
the U.S. Supreme Court's decision
Wednesday that the Defense of
Marriage Act, which banned gay
marriage at the federal level, was
unconstitutional.
The AP reported that Federal
Judge David Lawson said in his
remarks that the Michigan law
was unconstitutional as it violated
the Equal Protection clause of the
U.S. Constitution.
While the 2011 law applied to all
public employees of the state, Uni-
versity spokesman Rick Fitzgerald
said because of a loophole in the
legal language of the University's
benefits policy, same-sex couples
could technically receive benefits
after the law went into effect.

South University bar
boasts 40 rotating
taps and live stage
By FARONE E. RASHEED
Daily StaffReporter
Despite the inclement weath-
er, the atmosphere inside the
World of Beer - Ann Arbor's lat-
est addition to the South Univer-
sity Avenue bar scene - was far
from downcast during its grand
opening Monday.
The craft beer establishment
- which opened its first location
in Tampa, Florida in 2007 and
now has several locations across
the Midwest - is located on the
corner of South University Ave-
nue and South Forest Avenue at
the base of the Landmark apart-
ment complex.
The bar features over 500
domestic, imported and craft
beers with 40 rotating draughts
providing an array of local
Michigan and Ann Arbor brews.
University alums Steve Rossi

and Chad Wilson are the owners
of World of Beer. Rossi said he
hoped their bar would become
another facet of the vast craft
brewery presence already in the
city, which consists of establish-
ments such as Ashley's, Arbor
Brewing Company and Grizzly
Peak Brewing Company.
"We have nothing but the
utmost respect for Ashley's,"
Wilson said. "They've done a
phenomenal job over the years
and they still do."
The 3,200 square-foot space
is highlighted by an elevated
stage for musicians and offset
by a full bar - which showcases
numerous coolers of its region-
al and international offerings.
A large garage door separates
the interior from the patio area
outside - a design choice that
Wilson said was inspired by the
original Florida location and
functions to "encompass that
open-air feeling."
Wy Adams, manager at the
neighboring Good Time Char-
ley's, said he could not recall any
other addition quite like World

of Beer on the block.
"I think it adds another
dynamic to things because it's a
live music venue," Adams said.
Adams said he welcomed the
new addition to the lineup of
campus bars. He said the new
bar will not likely infringe on the
clientele at Charley's because
craft beer does not usually find
its market among undergradu-
ates.
"The more competition, I
think, is better because it'll
bring more people," he said.
Though the bar does not have
a kitchen, they have partnered
with several local establish-
ments, allowing patrons to order
from one of several Ann Arbor
restaurants - including Pizza
House, Maize & Blue Delicates-
sen and Mr. Spot's - which can
be delivered directly to the bar.
"We have the best menu in
town because we've got all the
restaurants - you can get what-
ever you want," Wilson said. "And
if we don't have something, you
can bring whatever you want."

Center to begin patient trials
of breast cancer treatment

Drug, in combination
with chemo, could
prevent relapse
By TUI RADEMAKER
Daily News Editor
If a new treatment currently
being tested at the University's
Comprehensive Cancer Center
proves effective, breast cancer
patients' chances of relapsing could
be greatly decreased.
Anne Schott, associate professor
ofinternalmedicineattheUniversity
Medical School, is leading a clinical
trial on the effects of combining
standard chemotherapy with a
drug called Reparixin to destroy
the stem cells in patients suffering
from metastatic, or advanced stage,
breast cancer.
Reparixin was originally
designed and marketed by Domp6,
a pharmaceutical company to help
transplant patients accept their
new organs.
The idea for the research
was first brought up by Dr. Max
Wicha, director of the University
------- - --- -
BENEFITS
From Page 1
"The University benefits are
not offered on the basis of sex,"
Fitzgerald said. "It'sbasicallyoffered
on what's called an Other Qualified
Adult, or another adult living with
a University employee ... that is
qualified for benefits. The ruling
doesn't really affect the University's
ability to offer those benefits."
The University's policy,
which was drafted in 2008,
allows OQA benefits in cases in
which the employee is eligible
for benefits. Those eligible for
benefits are defined as another
person who has shared residence
with the employee for at least six
continuous months and does not
already receive spousal benefits.
When the bill was being
considered by the Michigan
legislature in 2011, University
President Mary Sue Coleman and
former University Provost Phil
Hanlon appealed to representatives
in a letter, writingthat there was "no

Comprehensive Cancer Center,
who realized that Reparixin
could hit the drug target CXCR1
for breast cancer stem cells that
he had been studying.
"In the laboratory it looked
promising, so now we're testing it
in people," Schott said. "This is the
first time it's ever been tested with
chemotherapy and definitely the
first time it's ever been tested in
cancer patients."
She said stem cells are only
a tiny part of a breast cancer
tumor - anywhere from around
0.5 to five percent - yet they
are responsible for creating
new tumors and thus making it
possible for women to relapse
years after being initially treated.
While standard chemotherapy
has proven effective in destroying
most cancer cells, it does nottarget
the stem cells. By combining
the stem-cell targeted drug
Reparixin with chemotherapy,
Schott said she hopes to achieve
not only the initial treatment but
also prevent regrowth.
"We know that we have a
combination therapy (that) can
shrink tumors but the stem cell part
evidence that (eliminating benefits)
will reduce health care costs."
The letter stated that in 2011, 570
qualified adults and 48 dependent
children depended on the domestic
partner benefits.
After the bill passed, Fitzgerald
said the University did not change
its policy.
"At the time (the bill) was being
considered it wasn't clear where
the legislature was headed with
this legislation, but the University's
policy is one that we believe serves
the best interests of the University
and its employees," he said.
State Rep. Adam Zemke (D-
Ann Arbor) said even though the
decision would not change the way
the University extends benefits to
its employees, he said he felt the
decision would have long-term
significance.
"(The reason the) University is
able to do what it does is because
of a gentleman's agreement, a
memorandum of understanding
between the governor and the
legislature and the University,"
Zemke said.
He said the relationship between

after tumor after tumor - those
are resistant to chemotherapy," she
said. "What we're developing is a
combination treatment to try and
do both: try to shrink the tumor but
then also get rid of these stem cells
that keep causing relapses."
While the clinical trial is in
its early phases, a number of
women have shown interest
in participating. At least one
patient has been undergoing the
combination treatment for a year,
which Schott said is a promising
sign as they are now able to
determine that Reparixin reacts
safely with standard chemotherapy.
The initial stages of the clinical
trial were carried out to determine
the best dose at which to administer
Reparixin, but Schott said they're
able to move into a second and more
comprehensive phase in which the
researchers will try to determine
the drug's impact on the tumor's
stem cells.
"We've certainly seen responses
in this treatment but we have to be
careful interpreting that because
of course the patients are receiving
standard chemotherapy along with
the governor and University could
change in the future, putting the
University's policy at risk.
"When we're talking about
statutes, they are not supposed
to be something easily changed
throughout time," Zemke said.
"They are supposed to be something
that last. And memorandums of
understanding like the University's
do not hold water in a real sense as
do statutes."
The ACLU of Michigan
challenged the law last year on
behalf of plaintiffs who were
unable to receive partner benefits
because they were not married.
Michigan passed a law that made
for a constitutional amendment that
banned same-sex marriage in 2004.
"We believe that this law that
tells certain public employers, cities
and counties, school districts that
you can't provide health insurance
coverage for same-sex partners of
an employee while you can provide
health insurance for just about
anybody else," Jay Kaplan, an ACLU
of Michigan staff attorney, said.
"It's discriminatory and its true
motivation was to target gay and

an experimental drug," she said. "I
wouldn't want to overstate and say
that we know right now that this is
an effective treatment but certainly
we've seen that it's very possible to
combine it with chemotherapy."
The full scope and application
of Reparixin is not yet known, and
Schott said that until researchers
do laboratory tests on the drug's
reaction with other forms of cancer,
it's not understood if this treatment
canbe applied morebroadly.
"Obviously if it looks interesting
in breast cancer, I think there will
be a lot of research being done
in other cancers to see if it might
effective there, but we're really
starting with breast cancer at this
point," she said.
For now, the research will
focus on breast cancer. In order
for the Reparixin-chemotherapy
combination to be approved as an
official treatment, an additional
clinical trial would be needed
which would compare one subject
pool using only chemotherapy to
another using the combination.
All patients currently
participating in Schott's study are
being given both drugs.
lesbian couples."
Kaplan said the law blocking
same-sex partner benefit also denies
the dignity of the relationships and
their families.
"This is the only state in the
country that has a law like this that
says providing health insurance
(to partners) wasn't based on
recognizing the relationship, it was
under different criteria that same-
sex partners would be covered,
made it illegal."
State Rep. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann
Arbor) said he was disappointed
when the governor signed into law a
bill that would revoke benefits from
families.
"When the bill was passed I spoke
up and said it was unconstitutional,
it was discriminatory," Irwin said.
"I'm glad this judge has stepped in
with the same rationale of the (U.S.)
Supreme Court to rule that this law
is unconstitutional, that it violates
the constitutional protections of
Equal Protection."
Zemke introduced a bill earlier in
the week, bringing the issue of gay
marriage back as a ballot question
for voters.

Burke falls, lands with Jazz

ADAM GLANZMAN/Daily
Former Michigan guard Tim Hardaway Jr. will join the New York Knicks this seaon.
Hardawa taken
24th by Knicks

By NEAL ROTHSCHILD
Daily Sports Editor
NEW YORK - His father hated
the Knicks, but that didn't matter.
Tim Hardaway Jr. was drafted
by New York with the 24th over-
all pick in the NBA Draft, giving
Michigan two first-round selec-
tions after Trey Burke was taken
ninth overall by the Minnesota
Timberwolves and later traded to
Utah.
It marks the first time since
1994 that the Wolverines boasted
two first-rounders.
The grudges Hardaway's
father held two decades ago won't
matter much.
"I don't mind it at all," Hard-
away said on a conference call
about his father's past with the
team. "I'm just happy to be part
of the New York Knicks franchise
and I'm just happy to be a part of
this draft process. It was a long
six weeks and I don't care what
team I'm playing for as long as I
get an opportunity out there."
Hardaway didn't see the same
slide down the draft boards that
Burke saw Thursday night, com-
pared to expectations. The former
Wolverine guard was expected to

land in the early to late 20s.
With guard and high-volume
shooter J.R. Smith testing free
agency, space could open on the
roster for Hardaway to see more
minutes. Current small forward
Iman Shumpert is a better defend-
er, but perhaps not as dynamic of
an offensive weapon.
"I think he's going to fit perfect-
ly," Burke said. "That's the kind
of player he is. Tim Hardaway is
a team player first. That's what's
most important, what he brings
to teams. He has the NBA gene in
him. I definitely think the Knicks
didn't go wrong picking him."
If last fall was any indication,
Hardaway should feel comfort-
able in his new home, Madison
Square Garden. At the 2012 NIT
Preseason Tip-Off, Hardaway
won MVP at the tournament,
scoring 23 points on 10-for-15
shooting as the Wolverines rout-
ed Kansas State.
"Coach Beilein and his coach-
ing staff did a great job of pre-
paring (me and Trey) for this
moment," Hardaway said. "We're
just excited, being able to come
out here and not just show our
talent but show our abilities out
there on the court."

WE DON'T DRIVE FAST

Greek Life
strives to be
co.-friendly

By DANIEL FELDMAN
Daily Sports Writer
NEW YORK - There's some-
thing about a walk to a sporting
event in Ann Arbor.
I always appreciated the notion
that I could walk to games at
Michigan, whether it be football,
basketball, hockey or any of the
minor sports. All are a manage-
able walk from around campus.
Even tmore, I appreciated the
conversations I would hear from
people as I walked back from
them. They were conversations
of either elation or sadness, but
above all else, confidence and
intelligence.
I thought that was just a caveat
of going to school like Michigan. I
never imagined being able to walk
to a major sporting event back
home in New York.
Then I moved to Brooklyn last
summer and the whole concept
changed. It was Thursday that I
,.realized the walk in Ann Arbor is
a unique and special experience
in sports.
On Thursday, I was able to
make that walk. The NBA Draft
took place at the Barclays Center
and two former Michigan players,
Trey Burke and Tim Hardaway
Jr., were seen as first-round picks
before they ultimately became
first-round selections. If there
was a night to replicate what I've
grown to appreciate about Ann
Arbor, tonight was it.
Wearing a Michigan hat, I
began my short but eventful walk
to the draft. I wasn't even halfway
to my destination when I got my
first "Go Blue" chant of the day.
The best was yet to come, I hoped.
Finally at the Barclays Center,
a pack of fans covered the pavil-
ion in front of the main entrance
to the arena. Wearing jerseys of
new, old and possibly future stars
of the NBA, the crowd slowly
began entering the arena as the
clock struck six.
As I got through security,
bright yellow shirts began to
appear all over my horizon. Mich-
igan would be present tonight.
Walking around the arena with
my dad and good friend, Eric, it
t Iwas clear no one really had confi-
dence where Burke or Hardaway
Jr. would go in the draft. Even the

idea of who would go first overall
remained a question mark.
When we reached our seats in
section 206 - to the left of the
stage - we were greeted with a
sea of red. It wasn't Ohio State or
Nebraska scarlet. Rather, it was
Indiana crimson.
Still, seeing this wasn't entirely
frightening. I wasn't in "enemy
territory" like Bloomington or
Columbus. I was in Brooklyn. Not
exactly "Big Ten Territory," yet. I
had experienced worse.
Before long, the chants of "I0
and 2" began. After Indiana beat
Michigan twice this year in bas-
ketball, the point was clear. I gave
a thumbs up symbol to them and
waited for the show to start.
As former Hoosiers Victor Ola-
dipo and Cody Zeller went sec-
ond and fourth, respectively, the
cheers grew louder. As the Sac-
ramento Kings came on the clock
with the seventh pick, I thought
the moment to silence the crowd
was here. It wasn't.
That was fine though, the
Detroit Pistons were next. Surely
the adopted home state of Burke
would take a flyer on him - a
player that matched a need of
theirs - especially with such
value in the eighth selection. It
wasn't to be.
Yet, before the fear that Burke
would fall had sunk in, he was off
the board. The Minnesota Tim-
berwolves, a team with a solid
point guard already in Ricky
Rubio, had picked him. A trade
had to be in the cards. And it was.
After falsely hearing about a
trade to the Portland Trail Blaz-
ers, I was told a deal with the
Utah Jazz was being finalized.
The fans' gibes behind me had
finally stopped.
While the Hoosier fans now sat
there quietly, possibly of think-
ing about ordering a Charlotte
Bobcats' Zeller jersey, the rest of
the mostly New York crowd grew
excited. The Brooklyn Nets and
New York Knicks lone picks in
the draft were fast approaching
at No. 22 and 24. After that, the
place would start clearing out in
droves.
Then the moment happened.
As I checked to see the latest
rumblings, a series of tweets
started rushing onto my screen

- the Knicks were about to select
Hardaway Jr., the son of a Knicks'
rival in the late 1990s, the Miami
Heat's Tim Hardaway Sr.
As NBA Commissioner David
Stern walked to the podium for
one of the last times to announce
the pick, a buzz started to grow.
"With the 24th pick in the 2013
NBA Draft," Stern said. "The New
York Knicks select Tim Hard-
away Jr."
Hysteria rang out. Behind me,
in front of me, to the left and right
of me, screaming was going on.
Knicks' fans weren't angry.
They weren't upset, either. They
had seen what Hardaway Jr. had
done in college and what the
Knicks had failed to do in the
playoffs: win.
As people started to leave
while the first round came to a
close, I walked with Eric across
the street to Atlantic Terminal,
where he would be taking the
train back to Long Island. But I
heard another voice in the dis-
tance again.
This time it wasn't a heckler. It
was two MTA workers waiting to
go home too.
"The Knicks got Tim Hard-
away (Jr.)," one said. I was stum-
bling once again into what I
had learned to love about the
aftermath of Michigan sporting
events.
I wanted to join in on the con-
versation. I wanted to help dis-
sect the selection. I wanted to see
what two Knicks fans had to say
about the team's newest player.
Most importantly, I wanted to
hear what two newcomers had to
say about a former Michigan ath-
lete.
Then I heard the response of
the other gentleman. "Is that Tim
Hardaway (Sr.'s) brother?"
Fuhgeddaboudit.
The sky looked like it was
about to open up any minute. I
rushed out the terminal door and
started my walk home. I no longer
had the desire to converse with
others.
Brooklyn wasn't what I know
Ann Arbor to be. There were
chattering fans, but when it was
all over, it was nothing more than
chatter.
You just can't replicate a Ann
Arbor anywhere else.

timprove efficiency

By ALEXA DETTELBACH
Daily Sports Writer
The beginning of the Michi-
gan basketball team's impres-
sive 2012-2013-basketball
season did not start with its pre-
season route of Northern Michi-
gan on Nov. 1. It started in the
summer.
When sophomore forwards
Mitch McGary and Glenn Rob-
inson III elected to return to
Ann Arbor for a second season
the Wolverines knew they had
significant talent to build the
2013-2014 season around.
When guards Trey Burke and
Tim Hardaway Jr. decided to
return to their maize and blue
locker rooms for the 2012-2013
season, after their freshman
and sophomore years respec-
tively, Michigan knew it had the
same opportunity.
Burke and Hardaway fol-
lowed up their decisions with
skill camps over the summer -
which set the stage for their his-
toric season.
Following in their footsteps,
McGary and Robinson elected
to do the same.
McGary went to the Amar'e

Stoudemire Nike Skills Camp for
big men from June 24-26, while
Robinson attended the Kevin
Durant Nike Skills came for
wing players from June 28-30.
Burke participated in the Chris
Paul and Deron William camps,
while Hardaway attended the
Durant camp last summer.
History continued to repeat
itself on July 2, when it was
announced that McGary and
Robinson were invited to take
part in the Lebron James Skills
Academy in Las Vegas, which
features the top 20 college play-
ers in the nation.
Burke and Hardaway were
invited to the same academy last
summer and have said it helped
them gauge the rest of the estab-
lished talent.
For the first time since 1994,
the Michigan men's basketball
team had two players taken
in the first round of the NBA
Draft. Though Robinson and
McGary could have changed
that number had they elected
to turn pro after their first sea-
son in Michigan, their decision
to stay has kept the Wolverines
in contention for the 2013-2014
season.

Despite issues,
branch intends to
contribute to CSG
By WILL GREENBERG
Daily StaffReporter
Central Student
Government's University
Council may have had a rocky
past two years, but Public
Policy junior Bobby Dishell,
new UC chairman and CSG Vice
President, is not deterred.
The UC - which consists of
delegates from each individual
school in the University - was
formed in 2010 but has been
plagued with poor attendance
and low functionality despite
attendance by top administrators
such as University President
Mary Sue Coleman.
Dishell said the goal of the
UC has been to "expedite" CSG's
legislative process as students
can propose ideas developed

in the council to the general
assembly, which could lead to
efficient implementation of
popular ideas.
"It's a really powerful tool
to go into this review path,"
Dishell said. "And this upcoming
year we're really looking to
utilize it and legitimize the
organization."
The issue of UC functionality
has been discussed in the past,
particularly among CSG vice
presidential candidates who,
in the last election, argued the
council could be better utilized
in a more active role.
Dishell said one reason for
the lack of functionality on the
UC is because the bylaws that
govern the meetings are still
in the process of being written.
Another issue is a lack of
public information - the
council's website has yet to be
completed.
Former CSG Vice President
Omar Hashwi said he felt the UC
still has an ability to contribute

to CSG.
"The UC has yet to reach its
potential," Hashwi said. "Do I
believe we've exhausted the UC's
potential? No, but do I believe
that we've established a strong
and united foundation for the
years ahead, most definitely."
Hashwi said the council was
similar to the U.S. Senate in
both form and function.
"In the future, it is important
that the UC remains a body that
views all colleges equally and
bases their decision- making on
not only what is most beneficial
to their college but also to the
student body at large," Hashwi
said.
The University has one of the
few student governments with
multiple legislative bodies.
Hashwi said having the UC
allows more projects to be
brought to the table and the
council has been "more helpful
to the individual student
governments than to CSG."

Sorority and
fraternity houses to
undergo retrofits
By SAM GRINGLAS
Daily StaffReporter
LSA senior Kevin Kononenko
never joined a fraternity, but he's
set out to make University Greek
Life a whole lot greener.
Thanks to the Greek Life
Sustainability Team Kononenko
founded two years ago, the Delta
Gamma sorority house will be the
first at the University to undergo a
sustainability retrofit this fall. And
Kononenko said Delta Gamma's
project is only the beginning.
Because fraternity and
sorority members pay energy
costs such as electricity and heat,
Kononenko said the property
companies who manage the
houses have little incentive to
implement sustainable upgrades,
such as added insulation or
energy efficient appliances.
To encourage updates, GLIST
will create a financial plan for
members to repay landlords
for the upgrades, with energy
savings ultimately saving
members in the long run.
GLIST will also work with
local contractors on energy
audits to suggest specific
changes and build a retrofitting
plan tailored to each house,
complete with estimated energy
and cost savings. GLIST and
Greek Life members will learn
the science behind the projects
as well as changes they can make
to improve sustainability.
Engineering junior Sarah
Levine, a GLIST and Delta
Gamma member, said the team
started by reaching out to
potential pilot sororities.
Levine lived in the Delta
Gamma house last year and
approached her landlords first.
After presenting GLIST's ideas,

the landlords were excited to
hear more and were soon on
board.
"Retrofits are a great place to
start for a house becoming more
'green,' " Levine said. She noted
changes could be small and
inexpensive yet still decrease
energy bills. She added that
fraternities and sororities are
perfect sustainability partners
since they house a large number
of students, providing student
environmental advocates the
opportunity to encourage
change in a large, visible part of
campus.
Levine and Kononenko said
they hope to expand sustainable
retrofits to the rest of the Greek
community as part of ongoing
efforts to educate and encourage
campus to adopt a greener
culture.
A BS candidate in Program in
the Environment, Kononenko has
grown to intimately understand
the direct relationship between
human choice and environmental
health.
"There's real value in
considering (how) ' the way
you live your life affects your
surroundings," Kononenko said.
"You're inherently connected to
the environment whether you
like it or not."
With so many friends in the
highly visible institution of Greek
Life, Kononenko said he saw
fraternities and sororities as the
perfect target for implementing
sustainability initiatives. When
he approached University
officials, they suggested
financial incentive as a method
for connecting students with
their environmental choices.
Kononenko agreed with
University Greek Life's prediction
- that no one would feel compelled
to take action unless they could
trace their decisions with tangible
benefits or visible results.
So in October of 2011,

Students sligte
Congressional inaction on loan rate hike cannot continue
Student loan debt is a huge problem in this country - a one trillion dol-
lar problem, in fact. This problem was compounded Monday, when
Congress' inaction led to increases on government-funded student
loan interest rates. The interest rate for Stafford unsubsidized student loans
doubled from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. While the interest rate hike won't
affect current loans, it will affect the seven million people who are pre-
dicted to take government-funded student loans this year - which include
Stafford unsubsidized loans, Stafford subsidized loans and Parent Loan for
Undergraduate Students loans. Considering the already outrageous amount
of student loan debt accumulated by the public and the necessity for higher
education, the last thing Congress should do is allow interest rates to rise.

In 2007, subsidized interest rates
were to be gradually reduced from
6.8 to 3.4 percent over a course of
four years by the College Cost
Reduction Access Act. The act
expired in 2011, but was extended
by one year in a House of Repre-
sentatives compromise and then for
another year in 2012 after former
Massachusetts governor Mitt Rom-
ney and President Barack Obama
lobbied for it. This brought the act's
expiration date to July 1st, when
the interest rate reverted back to its
original 2007 rate of 6.8 percent.
Unsurprisingly, any chance of
Congressional action before the
interest rate hike was thwarted by
arguments between Democrats
and Republicans. Democrats origi-
nally wanted to keep the subsidized

interest rates the same for another
two years - a proposal that died
in the Senate - but since then they
have introduced another plan that
would tie interest rates to that of a
three-month Treasury note. This
is similar in principle to House
Republicans' Smarter Solutions for
Students Act, which would peg the
interest rates for all Stafford and
PLUS loans to the 10-year Treasury
note. Thus, interest rates would
vary from year to year in both plans.
However, neither one of these
plans does enough for students. Both
would virtually guarantee higher
interest rates across the board in
the long run. Moreover, the Depart-
ment of Education is currently rak-
ing in huge profits off of student
loans - $50.6 billion this year alone

- as a result of student loan inter-
est rates being considerably higher
than that of the money borrowed
to finance the loans. This is unac-
ceptable. Many Americans have no
option other than taking out loans
if they want to be able to afford a
college education, and no financial
argument justifies turning a quick
profit off of people who are trying to
enrich their lives by going to college.
Congress has to act quickly if
they want to take back this week's
addition to the student debt crisis,
as students return to classes for
the 2013-14 academic year in two
months. Regardless, their chronic
inability to act before a deadline
has come and gone is no excuse
for making higher education even
more difficult to afford.

Editor's note: This piece origi-
nally appeared on The Podium as
"Maura's Study A-Blog: A femi-
nist in Spain."
Before I arrived I imagined
that Spain would be something
like Italy, where I've heard that
men catcall to women on the
street constantly. One thing
about Barcelona that I can't
seem to get over, however, is the
degree to which this behavior
exists. Blatantly put, it's amazing
the way that women are treated
like pieces of meat. Perhaps my
state of mind is hyperaware of
perceiving this right now, seeing
as I'm reading a slightly misogy-
nistic book ("Fifty Shades of
Gray"), but part of me can't get
over the amount of over-the-top
approaches that women get here.
At first I thought it was just
because we're tourists and thus
likely targets, but I see local
womenbeingharassed too - and
on a daily basis! At home it's a
rarity for men to be obnoxious or
creepy in public unless you're out
drinking somewhere and thus
the behavior is "expected." Here
this type of behavior from men
is the norm: on the metro, on the
street and in public spaces. The
other day we saw a local woman
being so heavily harassed in our
metro car that she had to stand
up and move to another car. She
did so confidently and silently,
which was the- proper way to
handle the situation, but no
sooner had she left then the two
men started to heckle us. We fol-
lowed suit and changed metro
cars. The men were carrying on
after us, bothering the entire car
full of people.
This wasn't an isolated inci-
dent. We often have to change
sides of the street or alter our
route goingsomewhere simply to
avoid unwanted catcalls. Some-
timeswe've approached in asitu-
ation where men walk up behind
us suddenly, follow us or won't

stop talking to us. At first we
were taken aback and somewhat
scared, but now it has gotten to
the point where it's just annoy-
ing. We can handle the situation
by telling them in Spanish not
to bother us or just by ignoring
them and walking away confi-
dently.
This rant may sound comi-
cal to some, self-serving to oth-
ers or downright whiny, but in
reality I am trying to uncover a
deep-seated cultural predica-
ment. Why is it allowable for
women to be treated in this
manner? Why do men get to live
their lives without this constant
"annoyance" and blatant harass-
ment each day on the street?
It's embarrassing and shameful
to be put on the spot by strange
men that you have no desire to
have any kind of contact with.
In America we have laws against
harassing people so that they
don't have to feel this way. Even
so, America has its fair share
of harassment on a day-to-day
basis. Men and women alike are
victims every day.
The root of this issue is com-
mon courtesy and respect.
Harassment is fostered in a com-
munity without reverence for
personal space. Everyone should
be able to live in the way they
want to - wearing what they
want and walking where they
want - without being pestered.
This isn't meant as a comment
on how Europe lacks a respect
for personal space, but rather a
comment on how important it is
to remember that a little respect
goes a long way. While cultures
differ and the norm of what is
"disrespectful" fluctuates from
country to country, a line can
be drawn. Women should be
treated with the utmost respect
wherever they choose to travel.

You should pity A-list celeb-

gone through

renown. Think
- the nonstop no At Rave20
privacy, the need
for sex appeal A24
and the fight to
stay relevant. In the zeitgeist of
hyper-speed this and dick-pic

that, one element defines this
age: distractions. The checkout
counter rag shelf is microcosmic
to something no stubborn per-
son will ever admit: your lifestyle
thieves from the rich and the
famous. Now, originality ceases
to exist as your "different" shoes
are most certainly influenced by
some slab of pop culture. This is
where Sofia Coppola's "The Bling
Ring" wins - intellectuals can
condemn materialism ad nause-
am, but deep down, we all want
the same thing: Louis Vuitton
shades.
Coppola ("Lost in Transla-
tion") likes to texture her beloved

characters. As such, their rich
flaws and insecurities arrive at
the forefront. In "The Virgin
Suicides," a God-fearing mother
brainwashes her five pubes-
cent daughters to a fault with an
overbearing moral compass. In
her later Oscar-winning "Lost
in Translation," she profiles two
strangers who, by appearances
alone, should be happy. Not so.
In any case, Coppola uncomfort-
ably unfolds each character into
almost a caricature. "The Bling
Ring" and its plot drivers hop in
a coupe teeming with excessive
vanity, faux smiles and off-the-
radar emotional IQs. What up,

bitchez?
Welcome to somewhere in
SoCal, comprised of people who
would actually call their home-
town something like "SoCal."
An opening scene with the ever-
funny Leslie Mann playing mom
of Nicki (Emma Watson, "Harry
Potter") nicely captures what
we're dealing with: a.m. adder-
all doses, obligatory pre-school
prayer, and off they go, still hun-
gover from the night before. On
the other side of the tracks, we
have Marc (Israel Broussard),
the new kinda-closet-gay dude
secretly hooked on high fashion
to veil his "ugliness." The glue of
the story, Rebecca (Katie Chang,
"CUTEeGRL"), befriends Marc
and tucks him into her circle of
friends, played by Taissa Farmi-
ga, Claire Pfister and the afore-
mentioned Watson. Embrace the
VIP, Marc.

and soon her entire Team Bitch,
to grow benumbed to potential
for consequence. They're so good,
why stop? Frequent hobby turns
addiction when Google-able
celeb addresses and TMZ updates

Rebecca's infectious mania over
Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hil-
ton's goodies peaks as her most
common line becomes "It's fine,"
whenever Marc suggests they
roll out before LAPD skids into
the gated driveway. There seems
to be no principle of diminishing
returns: the more, the better.
People gravitate toward and
admire rainmakers. They pos-
sess the obsessiveness, clever-
ness and skill in moving others
that a Mozart or Ben Franklin
would use for innovation. Rebec-
ca is no exception. She allures
us not because of her fucked-up
obsession, but rather her tenac-
ity - the way she characterizes
robbing Rachel Bilson's house as,

"I want some Chanel," complete
with a puppy-dog expression.
We believe her obsession and,'""
frankly, love her inexplicable
happiness. She deftly plays the
key ingredient without robbing
scenes from her cohorts.
Watson and Farmiga make a
pair we've all seen somewhere
in life: the attached-at-the-hip,
brutally honest, fairly daft bes-
ties. Butterfly sunglasses and
henna tramp-stamps augment
their inherent bitchiness, which
is really just a defense mecha-
nism for their lostness and
laughability.
The polarized lensing ping-
pongs back and forth between
glacial tracking close-ups and
amphetamine-induced Facebook
photo montages. It breathes in
sync with the medium-depth-.
script.
Coppolla's

At the end of the day, though,
do these characters matter?
They're hugely important in a
way Regina George in "Mean
Girls" or Vanessa Hudgens in
"Spring Breakers" weren't.
They're a mirror reflection of
what we millennials pride our-
selves on: believing an experi-
ence didn't happen unless the
www sees it. Plus, they transpar-
ently disclose their derived style

ing behind a facade of indepen-

We're all sick of the tired
argument that celebrities aren't

They're much realer than the
aimless projections of people
who try to embody them. You

That image sums up this movie
in a nutshell: You're entertained by
what you see, but you know that's
not what you're supposed to be
entertained by. It's a very clear line
that Emmerich chooses to blur, and
while it may work at times, there's
no question that a little less of it
would have made the movie a lot
more than it is.

J 's the crack of dawn, Sunday
morning (11 a.m.) and I open
my eyes that are still caked
with 10 pounds
of mascara
from Saturday
night. I think to
myself there is _
no way in hell
I'm getting out
of bed. As I start
to drift back to NATASHA
sleep a delicious ERTZBISCHOFF
thought creeps -
into my
psyche: breakfast.
The tantalizing thought of crispy
bacon and fluffy eggs jolts me to
life and I put on lilac shorts, a hot
pink V-neck and a floral headband
for good measure. Then I roust my
roommate out of her hibernation -
and she rips my head off much like
a grizzly bear would - and we set
out to scavenge something fried and
dripping in grease.
On our walk to a quaint mom
n' pop restaurant, Nookies, I spot
something odd - something very
odd. I do a double take and realize
the unfortunate outfit this girl is
wearing isn't a mirage. Her rainbow
suspenders, pleather skater skirt,
10-inch pleather platform shoes and
knee-high rainbow socks are real
(gasp). I grab my roommate and tell
her to check out the life-size Hara-
juku girl.
After I recovered from disbe-
lief at that heinous ensemble, out
of nowhere a whole pack of people
appears wearing these ridiculous,
whimsical rainbow outfits. I feel
faint at the sight and I'm thinking
to myself that I'm either losing it or
there's a full moon out. Then I hear
a boy chanting:
"I'm gay and proud, gay and
proud, GAY AND PROUD!"
Suddenly it hits me and I start to
smile, realizing the cause for all the
tacky rainbow is the Chicago Pride
Parade. So I extend my hand to the
boy that's chanting, high five him
and yell back "HELL YEAH."
For a split second he stares at
me, his face a cocktail of confusion
and elation, and you know what he
said back to me? "Thank you - I
love you."
After we passed all the pride
paraders and returned home, I went
straight for my laptop. I Googled the
Chicago Pride Parade and started
to read a little bit about its history. I
learned this particular parade com-
memorates the rebellion of LGBT
patrons of the Stooewall Inn ioNew
York Gity and that this is the 44th

one. I looked through the picture
gallery and saw people dressed in
the same outfits I had seen earlier,
hugging each other and smiling
with pure happiness washing over
their faces. Seeing that genuine
happiness, I was happy as well, and
hoped the Pride Parade would con-
tinue for another 44 years.
"I'm gay and
proud, GAY AND
PROUD!"
The next day, I still couldn't stop
thinking about that boy. I couldn't
understand why he seemed so
shocked I had high-fived him. He
had actually thanked me and told
me he loved me. Frankly, in the
moment, I hadn't even given the
high-five a second thought before
doing it.
I just didn't really get it - the
rainbow socks, the "Legalize Gay"
American Apparel tanks or the boy's
happiness. But then again, I guess I
didn't really get it because I have
always been allowed to be who I
really am. I guess if someone told me
I couldn't be Natasha, I would wear
a bunch of loud clothing because I
would want people to hear me loud
and clear - I'm me and I don't give
a damn what you think about that.
But then I realized that, in fact, I
was wearing a bunch of loud cloth-
ing. Sure I was only wearing two
instead of all seven colors of the
rainbow, but my lilac shorts and
pink shirt were really serving the
same purpose as those rainbow
socks. They were saying something
about me (in however small of a way)
and I had never given that a second
thought. I had never given a sec-
ond thought to the great privilege
of being able to wear what I want,
be whom I want and to love whom
I want. Finally, the rainbow socks I
had mocked earlier made sense.
Then I realized something else
- gay pride isn't just about being
proud of dudes liking dudes or
chicks liking chicks. It isn't just
clothes - it's about parading about
in your true colors. It's about people
liking themselves and unapologeti-
cally saying to the world "I'm me
andI'mproud."

Instead, this decision shifts
the burden from the states to
individuals, who must now chal-

Which brings us back to

The exuberance outside the

ful affair, filled with kisses

against DOMA. He is a calcu-
lating man, meticulously aware
that the ruling still leaves same-

cretion of the state, particularly
those who have actively worked
toward restricting votes within
their communities.
The effects of the VRA are
far-reaching and profound. Rob-
erts doesn't expect Congress
to revitalize the legislation by
creating an updated formula
through which the federal gov-
ernment can monitor racially
discriminatory areas.
Here's to hoping they rip the
cake right out of Scalia's hands.

From Page 3
So in Octoberof2011,Kononenko,
in collaboration with plastic
manufacturer Dart Container,
launched Trust for Cups. The
program, administered by GLIST,
encouraged fraternities to adopt

sustainable practices in exchange
for a discount on disposable plastic
cups, an essential item for Greek
events across campus.
In order to benefit from the
cup discount, participating
fraternities were required to attain
a 35 percent recycling rate and
elect a sustainability chair to their
executive boards.
By the end of the 2012-2013

academic year, 12 fraternities had
participated, with 10 starting
successful programs.
This year,Kononenkosaid GLIST
will transition Trust for Cups
into a Greek Life-wide recycling
competition where fraternities
and sororities will record their
recyclingrates as part of a challenge
against other houses.
"We're trying to utilize the

competitive energy of Greek Life,"
he said.
rKononenko said GLIST revolves
around sparking dialogue and
building an eco-conscious culture
in Greek Life - one that he said
begins with a simple action like
recycling and escalates to the
renovations soon to make a brown
and white sorority house on Oxford
a little greener.

meeting, rovost
explains historic
budget adjustments
By AARON GUGGENHEIM
ManagingNews Editor
June has been a busy month
for the University's Board of
Regents, as it recently drafted the
University's budget and tuition
rates for next year.
University Provost Martha
Pollack sat down with The
Michigan Daily to discuss
changing tuition rates, increasing
socioeconomic diversity at
the University and working to
increase state appropriations.
Pollack briefly discussed
tuition equality. Regents and
administrators have been
grappling with the issue in the
face of student protests this year.
She said the University has
yet to finalize a decision after
receiving a report from a task
force assembled to research the
issue.
"I believe that there will be
some kind of announcement fairly
soon but I don't have an exact
date," Pollack said.

Pollack said the continuing
increase in tuition is due to cuts in
state appropriations - which are
at half the per-student level they
have been in the past decade - as
well as the nature of the higher
education system.
"There are kinds of industries
like ours that are very labor
intensive and in those labor
intensive industries, costs tends
to grow faster than inflation," she
said. "That is part of the reason
you see super-inflationary tuition
growth in the past."
Pollack added that such growth,
which goes beyond the rate of
inflation, was not a sustainable
trend and the University would
continue to have to raise tuition to
battle increasing operatingcosts.
"The goal is to find some
sustainable path between those
two extremes," she said.
The 2013-2014 tuition increase
was the lowest in 29 years for
in-state students, with a rate
increase of 1.1 percent for in-state
students and a 3.2 percent increase
for out-of-state students.
Pollack said the University has
tried to contain raising tuition
rates in the last 10 years by
being "really aggressive at cost
containment" and increasing the

in the fact that the University now
meets full need for out-of-state
families earning $40,000 a year
or less.
"The biggest change (in the
budget) is financial aid," she said.
"We have continued to really put
even more resources into financial
aid. That is the one big dramatic
change."
The challenge to increase
financial aid, thus lowering
the burden for out-of-state and
in-state students, will also be
addressed through the upcoming
capital campaign, which will
seek to secure billions in
donations.
Pollack said the most important
goal of the campaign would be to
find donors who would provide
additional support to financial aid
programs.
Despite these efforts, she said
there were too many variables to
determine what tuition rates will
be in future years.
"We always want to have
tuition increases to be as low as
possible but there is just so much
uncertainty," Pollack said. "There
is a lot going on in higher ed right
now and I don't think anyone can
say what tuition will be in two
years or four years."

Pollack said though
socioeconomic diversity for
in-state students has been
trending upwards, the University
is still concerned about the low
number of applicants coming from
low-income families, both in-state
and out-of state.
She said the University's goal
for socioeconomic diversity is to
have roughly the socioeconomic
diversity of the demographic of
high-school students who score
at or above the 25th percentile on
the ACT.
But Pollack said University
research has shown once a
student has applied, his or her
socioeconomic status does not
necessarily determine attendance.
"Once they apply, they are
equally likely to get in and once
they get in, they are equally likely
to come," she said.
Pollack added that, under
the guidance of Lisa Rudgers,
University vice president of
communications, the University
has been brainstorming ways to
reach out to low-income students
toencouragethemtoapply. Efforts
have included simplified financial
aid brochures and mailings.
However, out-of-state

In addition, more out-of-state
students have been enrolling in
the University, a trend Pollack
said was the continuation of
a "really dramatic drop" in
Michigan high-school graduates.
Pollack said the University was
attempting to address this lack of
diversity in out-of-state students
through increased financial aid.
On state appropriations:
Pollack said though state
appropriations have increased,
they did not make up for the
massive cuts from previous years.
She added that Cynthia
Wilbanks, University vice
president for government
relations, has gone to great
lengths in past years to build an
alliance with business leaders and
legislators in order to secure more
appropriations for the University.
"We are very pleased that for
the past two years we have gotten
an increase but it has been small
and it hasn't begun to make up
for the cuts," she said. "We are
working very hard to try to make
our case and really be sure that
GovernorSnyder and the legislators
really understand the value of the
University to the state"
